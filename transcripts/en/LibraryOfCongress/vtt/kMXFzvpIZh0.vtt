00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C..

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.210
&gt;&gt;Larry Applebaum: My
name is Larry Applebaum

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.920
from the Music Division here
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.540
It's always fun to
talk to John Szwed.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:35.290
You know we were talking
earlier today when you arrived,

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:36.900
and we started to
get into some things.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.080
And one thing led to another.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.100
And I looked at my watch,
and three hours had flown by.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.420
And that's what it's like
to talk to John Szwed.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.470
He brings-- and it's not just
because he's an anthropologist.

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.460
It's not just because he's
an author and a biographer.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.070
And a scholar.

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.270
It's that he has this
abiding curiosity

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.990
about all things
certainly related to music.

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:03.790
But even beyond music.

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:05.740
John, welcome back to
the Library of Congress.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.580
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: Thanks,
thanks very much.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:09.890
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: It's
not your first time here.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.390
Do you remember your first
time here at the Library?

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.060
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: To doing
something for the Library?

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.370
Or just wandering in?

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.380
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: Well, I
mean to do some work here.

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.400
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: It was
Jelly Roll Morton.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.640
Yes, the Jelly Roll
Morton boxed set.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.670
And we did the staff dug up the
original mics, and it was kind

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.750
of interesting to see what
people actually used to talk

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.910
to when, record with in 193--
what was the date of it?

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:40.210
Thirty-eight, thirty-nine,
forty?

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:41.920
Somewhere in there?

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.220
Yeah.

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:44.520
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum:
Thirty-eight, yeah.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.820
You won a Grammy for that.

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.120
For the booklet for that.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.420
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: I did.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.720
I suppose I should have
shared it with the Library.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.790
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: Well it's an
important piece of scholarship.

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.650
It's an interesting story also.

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.480
Why don't we talk, talk
just a little bit about that

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.340
because it was one of the great
pleasures for me as an engineer

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.410
as I got to work with the
original discs to transfer them.

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.970
We literally got them into
the right speed, finally.

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.600
Which meant the songs
are in the right key.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.040
But what did you actually do?

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.480
What were you-- what
materials did you work

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.550
with to inform your public?

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.570
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: Well, the
real challenge and I,

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.630
I don't need [inaudible]
if they're,

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.230
they're challenges is that.

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.190
I remember a teacher saying to
me once, "What would you say

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.840
about a person who made claims

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.330
that were absolutely
unbelievable,

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.140
like 'I invented this or that?

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.630
You know, I was the first
to do this and that.'

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:41.940
And you know this is wrong.

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.750
Do you just blow him off
as a blowhard and a fool?

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.900
But then you find out
he was 90% accurate

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.420
but everyone won't
acknowledge that?"

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:51.820
And I thought, "Now,
that's fascinating."

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.020
So the guy has been treated
as a buffoon in some ways.

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.320
And in his time as a nuisance.

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.640
But he was telling the truth
with the things he claimed.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.030
So that was my first test

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.580
to see just how much
this person could do.

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.220
And the joke was on me.

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.050
You know, I may have
gotten a Grammy for it.

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.700
But months later, I found
out more and more and more

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.640
and thought, "Oh
boy, I missed this."

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.990
I mean, could a guy claim
that he invented jazz?

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:20.630
And could claim that he been
a hit at all sorts of media?

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:23.350
That he sold thousands
of records, et cetera?

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.360
And also been a boxing promoter?

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.200
And also formed the first
multi-racial film company

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.430
and D-- it was in
D.C. by the way.

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.100
And also been in auto racing
with Jack Johnson, the boxer?

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.410
And it goes on and
on and had a wife

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:39.400
who ran an award-winning
restaurant?

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.490
I had missed all that.

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:45.500
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: How
did you learn these facts?

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.030
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: From a British
website which obsessively seemed

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.120
to track down everything
you could find in the world.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.420
There are such sites

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.060
where people seem to
live in that site.

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.790
And they live for that moment.

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:04.600
It makes you wonder then is it
possible to do all those things?

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:05.940
I suppose.

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.980
I mean, no one's
claimed otherwise.

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.280
And to use the name of--

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.100
Jack Johnson turned out
to have been a musician

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.400
as well as a boxer.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.040
Had a band, recorded, and
used to take a gigantic,

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.450
oversized bass around with
him to play with things.

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:21.150
So you know this is
perfectly reasonable.

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.280
Oh! I left out something.

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.590
While he was doing the show
at the Library of Congress.

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:28.970
It wasn't a show, it
was a recording session.

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:33.490
He had a radio show in Baltimore
making him the first radio DJ

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:34.830
of that kind of music.

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.130
It was presumably promoting his
own music as well as others.

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.420
But there you have it.

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:41.720
Well, [inaudible].

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.020
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: Are there
any surviving [inaudible]?

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.790
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: Not
that I could find.

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:47.430
This would be '30-- , '38
something like that, '39.

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:48.730
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum:
Any description

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:50.030
of what the contents-- ?

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:51.330
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: It was
called The History of Jazz.

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:52.700
But it could have been anything.

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:55.860
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum:
So did he invent jazz?

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.740
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: He's
the first person

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.130
to copyright a composition
which is called Jazz.

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:04.590
He certainly broke with
the previous tradition.

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:05.890
I don't know.

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:07.190
I mean, there's an
Italian film about this.

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:08.490
What's it called?

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:09.910
The Legend of 19-- something?

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:12.310
It's a very, very popular
cult film in Italy.

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:14.440
I can't think, Sixteen, maybe?

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:20.480
And let's see, Clarence--
I forget who plays.

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:24.280
It's about, it's about a
pianist-- it's a long story.

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.690
But it has to do with
a person who claims

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:29.750
to have superhuman
abilities at a keyboard

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:31.870
because he spent his whole
life on a boat with a keyboard.

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:33.330
It's challenged by
Jelly Roll Morton.

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:34.850
He's challenged by
Jelly Roll Morton

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:37.790
who claims he's the
greatest pianist alive.

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:41.050
And Morton clearly beats him.

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:45.090
But by the magic of film, the
other guy grows two extra arms.

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:48.840
And plays basically
four-handed piano and beats him.

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.690
But-- . The end of the year--

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:54.850
you know, he wrote a
film that's really awful.

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:56.150
I don't know who ever said this,

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:58.950
but really awful films
sometimes have one line

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:00.950
that make it worth
sitting through.

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:02.940
And the one line in this film,

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:05.980
I can't say for under our
current circumstances.

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:09.690
But two longshoremen years later
were walking by, and they said,

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:12.130
"And what did Morton
say after he got beat?

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:19.160
He said, 'Jazz.'" So
[laughter] it was worth sitting

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.930
through the film to watch
them destroy the film

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:24.180
in a way with that one line.

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:27.720
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: So let
me get some context for you

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.100
and your curiosity
and what draws you

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:32.000
to these kind of stories.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.400
Now what came first?

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:37.760
Your interest as a trombonist or
your interest in anthropology?

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:39.060
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: Well, I was,

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:41.970
I was a musician
very early in life.

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:46.950
I was, I was a union member,
14, something like that.

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:48.250
I had, I played bass.

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:49.550
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum:
This was where?

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:50.850
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: Where?

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:52.150
In, in South Jersey.

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:53.450
Outside Philadelphia.

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:56.070
I played bass, a couple
of other instruments.

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:59.640
And that seemed a
reasonable thing to do

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:03.940
for a long while,
right into school.

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:05.460
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum:
Were you any good?

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:08.310
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: I was a union
member, does that count?

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:09.610
I don't know.

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:10.910
[Laughter]

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:12.210
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: That
just means you pay your dues.

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:14.020
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: Well,
I got hired.

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:15.320
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: Okay, good.

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:16.620
Professional.

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:17.920
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: I, I,
I played, you know,

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:19.220
I played symphony gigs.

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:20.520
I played R&amp;B stuff.

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:22.370
You know, rock, I
mean, whatever.

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:23.910
And it was a way of living.

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:25.210
It was a way of learning.

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:28.010
I found it fascinating I
found, you know, great people.

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:29.730
It wasn't an easy life.

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:34.240
And I sort of drifted
into college.

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:35.690
I drifted into anthropology.

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:39.610
Why I stuck with it was I had
a teacher who was Austrian

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:42.650
and she spent a lot of
time talking about the US

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:43.950
as if it were a foreign country.

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:45.500
Which it was for her.

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:47.170
And every time she
would do this,

00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:48.800
it would put me in
a different place.

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:50.590
I'd be looking at something
or other and say, "Wow,

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:52.710
it's not what I,
quite what I thought."

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:54.680
And we were keeping
scrapbooks of things

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:55.980
that struck us that way.

00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:58.320
And I realized that it was a way

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:01.300
that you could put
yourself at a distance.

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:04.950
Still be a member and know what
you are, the society you are in.

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:06.800
And still see it
in a different way.

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.160
And that, that really
fascinated me.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:12.070
I thought most people don't
have any impulse to do that.

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:13.640
I don't mean that
you become a critic.

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:17.860
You just step back and say,
"What's this scene about?

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:19.160
What are these people doing?

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:21.780
Why are they, why are they
so enthusiastic about it?

00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:23.540
And why do they think
it's so unique?"

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:27.640
[Clears throat] That
it's, that it's so special

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:30.300
when so many other
people do the same thing?

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:32.260
And one of the things I
remember being stunned by,

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.650
right in my first
class was there was--

00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:36.980
I forget the exact number.

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:39.240
There, there are
36 or seven kinds

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:41.940
of kinship systems in the world.

00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:43.240
That's it.

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:47.150
And they repeat.

00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:50.220
They occur in different
places that are not connected.

00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:53.490
As if someone rolled dice
and kept rolling them.

00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:54.890
And they're coming up this way.

00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:58.580
Then I found that languages
weren't infinitely possible.

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:00.760
They were limitations
all over the place.

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:02.840
And I was fascinated
with the idea that people

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:05.180
who think they're the only
ones who do something,

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:06.610
or the only ones
who have something.

00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:08.480
There's so many other
people doing the same thing,

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:10.250
thinking the same way.

00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:13.620
And I, I thought, as I
became a journalist later on.

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:16.130
That this should
be a thing in the--

00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:20.520
what they used to call a manual
or guide for the journalists.

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:21.820
What not to do.

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:26.450
You should never say, "This
is the only, that's the first,

00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:28.730
that's the last, or
this is the death of."

00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:32.780
Something the Washington Post,
I must say, is very easy doing.

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:34.540
They're always killing things.

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:35.840
The death of the novel.

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:37.410
The death of the film.

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:41.190
I always quote [inaudible]
one of the people I wrote

00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:46.980
about who said, "A
music doesn't die.

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:48.910
You can find music
in any major city

00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:51.180
of the world whether it's
18th century, you know,

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:52.480
Philippines, whatever.

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:53.970
At some night of the
week, they're going

00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:55.440
to be playing that stuff."

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:56.740
You know, musics don't die.

00:09:56.740 --> 00:09:58.040
They can't die.

00:09:58.040 --> 00:09:59.340
It's musicians die.

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:00.950
He says, "They've been dying
for the last 20 years."

00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:04.190
And I, then I was thinking,
well you know, that's true.

00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:06.290
The talk about it that dies.

00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:07.790
It's not the, the subject.

00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:09.090
It goes on.

00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:11.010
This is around the world or
well you asked the question.

00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:14.790
But I found that was, it wasn't

00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:16.580
so much a subject
to make a living at.

00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:17.880
But it was a way of living.

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:20.600
And then, yeah, I guess you
could say musicians have the

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:23.050
same kind of position.

00:10:23.050 --> 00:10:25.310
They stare at audiences

00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:29.410
and wonder just what is
the show about exactly?

00:10:29.410 --> 00:10:32.490
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: You,
you alluded to something.

00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:36.410
This ability to have
a critical detachment

00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:37.880
that enables you to observe.

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:40.270
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: With
suspension of criticism.

00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:42.260
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: Okay,
so is that something you had

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:43.560
to train yourself to do?

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:46.480
Or were you able to
do this instinctively?

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:48.200
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: No, I
won't say, not at all.

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:51.710
I mean, it was, having
been born in the South

00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:53.730
in pre-Civil Rights days.

00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:58.140
Then brought to a northern
deeply-- what do we say today?

00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:00.190
Diverse community,
that was a jolt.

00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:01.490
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum:

00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:02.810
The awareness [inaudible]
by the way.

00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:07.220
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: Yeah, and,
and black, black belt,

00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:13.220
red clay country, it was
Green County, Alabama.

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:14.520
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: Okay.

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:16.320
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: But my first
gigs were with all black bands,

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:18.760
so I passed the first
test, I guess.

00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:21.090
That was kind of a jolt.

00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:25.780
I think, I think one thing was
I took a linguistics course.

00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:29.320
And one of the first
exercises was to try to figure

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:31.420
out that why you shouldn't write

00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:34.890
when you're writing
phonetically the word.

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:38.380
I'm trying to think.

00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:41.020
Whale. W-h-a-l-e, and w-a-i-l.

00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:42.590
There's a slight
difference in pronunciation,

00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:43.930
but you can't hear it.

00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:46.180
I mean, it's there
if [inaudible].

00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:48.530
Oh, a better example.

00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:51.600
If you, I forget
the rule for this.

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:57.480
But if you say "spin" you hear a
little [inaudible] the s, right?

00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:00.360
If you say "pin,"
you don't hear any.

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:03.260
If you put a match, lit match in
front of your face or a candle

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.840
and say "spin" the
candle doesn't go out.

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:07.780
You say "pin" it goes out.

00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:10.250
There's a tiny gust of
air that comes with it.

00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:12.270
You don't hear it,
but it's there.

00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:13.640
So it's fascinating
with the idea

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:16.320
that there were things
right in our language,

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:19.550
right in our mouths that we
don't know what they are.

00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:22.950
And only a person who's standing
way back from it and looks at it

00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:24.880
and says, "Yes, that's
not the same.

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:27.970
W-h-a-l-e- and w-a-i-l
are not the same sounds.

00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:31.110
You just think they are.

00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:33.060
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: I
don't hear any real accent,

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:36.060
but when you go back to
Alabama, does it come back?

00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:37.880
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: I don't
go back to Alabama.

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:39.230
It's a-- [Laughter].

00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:40.950
Do you remember Dizzy
Gillespie's line?

00:12:40.950 --> 00:12:42.250
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: I'll
never go back to Georgia.

00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:44.510
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: Remember
when he said he would repeat

00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:47.390
that in the [inaudible]
and then say, "Would you?"

00:12:47.390 --> 00:12:50.940
Oh, I did go back for
this [inaudible] thing.

00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:56.150
And -- it was better
than I remember it.

00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:59.470
I went to, I went to
a Lebanese restaurant

00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:01.070
where they were playing salsa.

00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:03.380
And I thought, this has got
to be better than I thought.

00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:06.520
And then I went to my
hometown which was really--

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:07.830
i mean, it's nothing changed.

00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:09.130
It's Faulkner country.

00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:12.000
It's forest primeval.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.400
It's everything's just the same.

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:17.470
And it turned out that two of
the wildest musicians going are

00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:19.640
from that little town.

00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:25.040
It's Larry Applebaum:
Donna Smith and Davy-- .

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:26.340
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: Williams.

00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:27.640
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: Yeah, they're
both in that little town.

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:28.940
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: Really?

00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:30.510
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: And
I said to them,

00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:32.560
"So how'd you break
loose from this town?

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:33.900
I got moved by my parents."

00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:37.620
They said they went to
Tuscaloosa once to a drug store.

00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:39.720
And the drug store
was selling records.

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:43.100
And these records are all black
and white colored, and they,

00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:45.290
they look very strange.

00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:46.590
The pictures were strange.

00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:48.190
And across the top it
said, "You never heard

00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:49.860
such sounds in your life."

00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:51.960
I said, "Well, they
were ESP records?"

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:54.690
So yes, we thought they were
extra sensory perception,

00:13:54.690 --> 00:13:56.700
but it was really Esperanzo.

00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:58.420
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: Esperanto.

00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:02.570
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: Yeah, so they
had walked into, they had walked

00:14:02.570 --> 00:14:05.230
into the most avante of
the music at the time

00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:06.530
from their little town.

00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:09.140
They went back saying, "We
really haven't heard anything

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:10.440
like this in our life."

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:11.980
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: Do
you think people change

00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:13.700
with their environment?

00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:15.000
And I, I guess-- .

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.300
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: In what sense?

00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:17.600
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum:
The reason I ask.

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:21.670
Did it really change
you and, and if so how?

00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:25.660
When you moved from
Alabama to New Jersey?

00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:31.520
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: Well, I mean.

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:35.320
I think we first lived in a sort

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:37.390
of flea bag hotel
when I first moved.

00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:41.960
My family in one
room for a long time.

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:44.180
And my mother used to
give me money to go

00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:45.960
across the street
to the theater.

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:47.540
It was a movie theater.

00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:52.780
And it wasn't segregated
theater, at least nor formally.

00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:54.870
But on Tuesdays,
they had black films.

00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:57.540
So I was watching black films
thinking they were Hollywood

00:14:57.540 --> 00:15:02.090
films, so I saw things like one
that's actually getting some

00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:03.390
currency now.

00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:06.390
I've forgotten for what reason.

00:15:06.390 --> 00:15:09.010
Called Sepia Cinderella.

00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:12.870
And another one called
Two-Gun Slinger from Harlem.

00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:16.960
And I mean, you know, I took,
I took this to be Hollywood.

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:18.260
I thought this was what it was.

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:19.770
But it was not, it was
not something I'd seen

00:15:19.770 --> 00:15:21.070
in the South for sure.

00:15:21.070 --> 00:15:22.870
And they wouldn't even have
been showing those films,

00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:24.170
I don't think.

00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:25.980
At least certain neighborhoods.

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:30.420
And they always had musical
things that went with it.

00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:33.330
And I was really taken by
the, [inaudible] basically.

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:36.700
They were the kind of things
they played is video jukeboxes

00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:38.000
in those days.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.300
Most people didn't
realize videos went back

00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:40.600
that far, but they do.

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:43.410
And these musicians
were pretty amazing.

00:15:43.410 --> 00:15:48.530
So I drifted somehow or other
to seeing Lionel Hampton's band.

00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:50.370
When I was still
a kid on my own.

00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:52.630
And a huge theater.

00:15:52.630 --> 00:15:56.060
It must have been the,
not the Earle, yeah,

00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:57.730
the Earle Theater
in Philadelphia.

00:15:57.730 --> 00:16:00.510
All black audience.

00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:01.910
And I was blown away.

00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:07.730
It was, it was the, it was a
different performance aesthetic.

00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:10.980
It was-- see if I
can be more specific.

00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:14.400
Well, when, when soloists
would walk to the microphone,

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:17.980
they walked with a kind of
confidence and, and assuredness

00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:21.100
that I'd never seen before
with people of color.

00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:24.850
And I'd never seen it with
white people for that matter.

00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:28.310
These were people
who were completely

00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:29.610
at home with their idiom.

00:16:29.610 --> 00:16:30.910
This is their idiom.

00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:32.260
This is their thing.

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:34.640
I was really, I was
really affected by that.

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:37.340
I found other people who had
that same kind of reaction.

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:39.710
They, they thought this was
a different way of being.

00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:41.960
You didn't have to
have a lot of money.

00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:44.330
You only had to have
a skill, a high skill

00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:46.670
that nobody else
shared with you.

00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:49.800
And I thought the
humor of the crowd

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:51.270
and so forth was
quite different.

00:16:51.270 --> 00:16:54.980
I, I was thinking, "I've
been missing something."

00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:58.940
And then when I first played
in, in African American bands,

00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:02.770
and for African American
audiences.

00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:04.910
You know, I was, I
drifted into that.

00:17:04.910 --> 00:17:06.210
I was comfortable in it.

00:17:06.210 --> 00:17:11.370
There was some-- I was
not surprised by it.

00:17:11.370 --> 00:17:15.490
I was-- it was the way of
life that I could deal with.

00:17:15.490 --> 00:17:17.510
And again, it's coming
in from the outside.

00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:18.810
Coming up north from the south.

00:17:18.810 --> 00:17:20.920
Coming in from white to black.

00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:23.040
I don't make any claims
on ever being black.

00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:26.100
I'm just making claims
on appreciating things

00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:27.400
that I didn't know about before.

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:31.190
And coming to see that they
were within our civilization,

00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:34.100
whole varieties of
being human that were,

00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:35.400
that were very powerful.

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:38.380
And they were, engines of
creativity, if you want.

00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:41.320
They were generating
one thing after another.

00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:43.940
And, and as I got older
and saw that they,

00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:46.370
this was the way show business
works, that you're kind

00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:49.930
of continually-- show
business and, and,

00:17:49.930 --> 00:17:51.320
and all the arts, I guess.

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:53.500
The fashion, the rest of it.

00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:55.660
You have to continually
reject what you had

00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:57.760
to introduce a new
audience and sell it again.

00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:01.990
But in the process,
it ends up recycling.

00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:06.090
So that when, when people my age
would say to their grandchildren

00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:07.390
or something or other, "Why,

00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:08.690
I remember when back
in my day-- ."

00:18:08.690 --> 00:18:09.990
It's true!

00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:11.580
Those shoes on those
'40s actresses?

00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:13.200
Whoa. [Inaudible]
He's charging what?

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:14.500
I don't know.

00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:17.240
A thousand dollars a pair?

00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:18.540
Barbara Stanwyck
was wearing them

00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:21.210
in 1942 in Double Indemnity.

00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:23.800
This is not a surprise, right?

00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:25.360
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum:
Right, indeed.

00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:27.960
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: And rap, may
I say quickly, was introduced

00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:32.610
by Louis Armstrong,
right, 1920-- four, five?

00:18:32.610 --> 00:18:35.800
Where he's talking
rhythmically over a song?

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:37.430
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum:
At least on record.

00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:38.730
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: And, I must say.

00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:44.810
In a much hipper, he's
putting a three beat

00:18:44.810 --> 00:18:47.040
over a four in his rap.

00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:51.200
And there's only a few rappers
who can pull that off today.

00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:52.500
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: Good point.

00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:53.830
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: And if I
find rap is a little corny,

00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:57.820
it's because their rhythms
are, shall we say, old?

00:18:57.820 --> 00:19:00.150
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: As
a musician in your case,

00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:07.270
you had to assimilate African
American aesthetic in order

00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:08.890
to be able to play
with these bands.

00:19:08.890 --> 00:19:11.890
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: Yeah, but radio
was already a self-assimilator.

00:19:11.890 --> 00:19:13.190
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: Okay.

00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:14.970
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: I mean, the
radio waves were filled with,

00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:18.540
when we moved to Birmingham,

00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:22.070
with the thing I most remember
is the gospel quartets had a

00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:23.370
distinctive style.

00:19:23.370 --> 00:19:26.960
When the soloists were going,
there was a riff behind it

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:29.930
that was often something like
the words "Chanka-lanka."

00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:31.430
Chanka-lanka, chanka-lanka,
and so on.

00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:33.310
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: Is
that like a jubilee style?

00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:34.610
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: Yeah, yeah.

00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:36.280
And it was, they were
writing on top of it.

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:38.910
And I didn't at the time know
that there were dance bands

00:19:38.910 --> 00:19:40.310
that did this, you know.

00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:41.610
R&amp;B bands were going to do it.

00:19:41.610 --> 00:19:44.060
And that that was
a certain style.

00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:45.530
There was an audience
style even.

00:19:45.530 --> 00:19:47.970
It was a way of supporting
everything.

00:19:47.970 --> 00:19:51.310
So I heard that stuff,
and it wasn't--

00:19:51.310 --> 00:19:54.400
i think I heard it more
than country music.

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:56.700
I do faintly remember
Hank Williams,

00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:58.580
even Hank Williams was
halfway there, right?

00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:00.730
He'd, he'd come up with
a black guitar player.

00:20:00.730 --> 00:20:05.020
He was always on the
edge of the Blues.

00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:06.320
Or, or something.

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:08.590
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: I kind of
listen to the way he phrases.

00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:10.720
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: Yeah, and
look, I mean taking--

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:13.340
he was doing what,
mock Cajun accents.

00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:21.020
And he had the whole thing
from teenage songs, car songs,

00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:24.070
really sad songs
about death and dying.

00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:26.470
And lonely people.

00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:29.990
He covered the whole,
whole realm.

00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:33.700
And country music has always
had that reach, I guess.

00:20:37.330 --> 00:20:42.230
When it's the question of
going white to black, I,

00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:44.400
this is [inaudible]
territory always.

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:48.000
It's always, in any age
you bring these topics up,

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.990
they take a different,
a different angle.

00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:55.290
I mean-- .

00:20:57.660 --> 00:20:59.840
Unless you're living in
a dream world, you don't,

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:04.870
don't know that, that certain
per, performance patterns,

00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:10.040
speech styles, taste,
sports, gestures,

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:12.080
et cetera are all shared widely.

00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:15.070
It shouldn't be a
surprise to you

00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:17.060
when these things
turn up crisscrossing.

00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:22.410
I know people who talk
about you know co-optation

00:21:22.410 --> 00:21:23.980
and you know stealing
each other's culture.

00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:26.900
But we're in a culture
which lives on cooptation.

00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:29.410
Lives on stealing other,
other people's culture.

00:21:29.410 --> 00:21:31.070
I once gave a talk when
I was pretty young.

00:21:31.070 --> 00:21:32.370
Someone said, "What's
it like-- ?"

00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:35.610
In the audience, said,
"What's it like to be living

00:21:35.610 --> 00:21:37.070
on somebody else's culture?"

00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:38.990
I said, "Is there anyone in
the room here who's not living

00:21:38.990 --> 00:21:40.290
on somebody else's culture?"

00:21:40.290 --> 00:21:45.190
Come on. I mean, that doesn't
give you the license to,

00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:47.360
well I guess you don't a
license to copy people.

00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:48.660
It's done all the time.

00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:49.960
But-- .

00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:51.260
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: How
about appropriation?

00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:52.630
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: Yeah,
but there's, I mean,

00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:53.930
that's the nature of art.

00:21:53.930 --> 00:21:56.410
I mean, art lives on that.

00:21:56.410 --> 00:22:00.600
I don't know that much about
painting, but more I learn

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:01.900
about it, the more I realize

00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:03.310
that one thing is
spinning off another.

00:22:03.310 --> 00:22:06.570
And the painters are
much closer to each other

00:22:06.570 --> 00:22:08.110
than I thought in their styles.

00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:12.230
And the, [inaudible]
we're talking classes.

00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:14.130
I, I, I always come
back to that cliche.

00:22:14.130 --> 00:22:18.800
I think it's from Stravinsky
when he said something like,

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:23.400
"Hack musicians, hack
composers borrow.

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:24.740
Serious composers steal."

00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:26.040
[Laughter]

00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:28.640
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum:
As an anthropologist,

00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:32.420
did you specialize in
an area of the world?

00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:35.940
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: Well,
I thought I did.

00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:38.740
I was set to go to the Caribbean

00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:42.190
and couldn't find any
way to pay for it.

00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:45.590
And getting kind of desperate.

00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:52.470
I saw an ad for Canadian
government was, wanted people

00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:59.430
to do studies of agricultural
regions in northeastern Canada.

00:22:59.430 --> 00:23:01.710
So I thought well,
Plan B, you know?

00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:03.990
That could be alright,
I don't know.

00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:06.220
I think I read Henderson,
The Rain King,

00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:09.910
where Henderson's anthropologist
sort of he's been to Africa,

00:23:09.910 --> 00:23:12.360
and he winds up in Newfoundland.

00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:13.910
Or Labrador, I guess.

00:23:13.910 --> 00:23:15.400
I thought, [inaudible].

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:18.480
So, so instead of the
Caribbean, I was headed off

00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:20.350
for 27-foot snowdrifts.

00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:21.650
And what have you.

00:23:21.650 --> 00:23:23.640
And so that's what
I did for a while.

00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:28.040
And then I thought I deserved
to, to go back to the Caribbean.

00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:30.370
I did some time in
South Carolina.

00:23:30.370 --> 00:23:33.320
And then I went to Trinidad
and Jamaica for a while.

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:35.290
And got into that.

00:23:35.290 --> 00:23:40.800
But I think overall,
I wanted to do music.

00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:46.000
And it, it sounds like you
should be able to do it

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.510
because it, you know, it's part
of human life and what have you.

00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:50.100
But I ran into trouble
everywhere I went.

00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:52.430
The first place I was
at Temple University

00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:55.970
where there were no courses
on African American anything.

00:23:55.970 --> 00:23:57.890
Despite being in an
African American community

00:23:57.890 --> 00:23:59.260
in Philadelphia.

00:23:59.260 --> 00:24:03.110
So I, I thought I
could give a course

00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:04.810
in African American music.

00:24:04.810 --> 00:24:06.690
And be the first.

00:24:06.690 --> 00:24:08.840
So I offered to do it for free.

00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:10.140
Which is the same.

00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:12.690
Not because I needed money

00:24:12.690 --> 00:24:15.670
but because nobody does
anything free in universities.

00:24:15.670 --> 00:24:20.260
So I hear back from the Dean of
the [inaudible] saying I went

00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:23.540
around him to contact another
dean, and that wasn't allowed.

00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:25.580
And the other said no, they
weren't going to do that.

00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:27.910
Well, that was a beginning.

00:24:27.910 --> 00:24:31.630
Some years later, I
was at Yale University.

00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:35.410
A much-esteemed and
celebrated place.

00:24:35.410 --> 00:24:38.560
And I thought since I was
writing a book on Miles Davis,

00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:40.660
I might off a seminar
on Miles Davis.

00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:41.960
So I said I would do that.

00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:43.680
It was rejected.

00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:47.630
Number one, because Yale
doesn't normally do seminars

00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:49.390
on individual people.

00:24:49.390 --> 00:24:51.230
And number two, because
Miles Davis hadn't

00:24:51.230 --> 00:24:52.780
accomplished enough.

00:24:52.780 --> 00:24:58.830
Well, I, I was thinking of
responding in some vile,

00:24:58.830 --> 00:25:01.770
nasty way when the
person who's in charge

00:25:01.770 --> 00:25:03.170
of such things in my department.

00:25:03.170 --> 00:25:06.090
Noted there were 37 such
seminars going that semester.

00:25:06.090 --> 00:25:09.750
Including on Gershwin
and others.

00:25:09.750 --> 00:25:11.050
But there'd never been any,

00:25:11.050 --> 00:25:13.280
anyone doing an African
American before.

00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:15.950
So when I pointed it
out, I got apologized to,

00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:17.250
but nonetheless,
it was the same.

00:25:17.250 --> 00:25:18.990
Oh, I actually skipped a year.

00:25:18.990 --> 00:25:21.470
The first job I ever
had was in Cincinnati

00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:25.000
where they had never had
anything on African Americans.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.430
And I said I would offer
some kind of course.

00:25:28.430 --> 00:25:34.290
And the chair of the department
said it's a non-subject.

00:25:34.290 --> 00:25:35.640
It's a non-subject, he said.

00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:36.940
And I read him to be saying

00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:39.040
on a non-people taught
by a non-professor.

00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:40.340
I don't know.

00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:41.640
So I'd had three, three--

00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:44.380
by the way, the Miles
Davis thing was in 2006.

00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:46.600
So it's not ancient history.

00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:50.690
But then I remember that one of
the colleagues I had at Yale,

00:25:50.690 --> 00:25:53.560
still alive, was the first
Jew hired at Penn State.

00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:56.620
So it's not, we're not
talking ancient history here.

00:25:56.620 --> 00:25:57.920
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: I
want to ask you more

00:25:57.920 --> 00:25:59.300
about the Miles Davis.

00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:02.580
And, and your other
books, the Sun Ra,

00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:05.900
the Billie Holiday,
the Alan Lomax.

00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:10.230
But you've used this
term already.

00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:12.800
For African American music.

00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:14.860
And I ask this question,

00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:16.780
it's a naive question,
but I ask it anyway.

00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:21.090
I asked this of Ingrid
Monsan when she was here.

00:26:21.090 --> 00:26:25.090
What do you think is African
about African American music?

00:26:25.090 --> 00:26:30.550
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: You could have
said what's American about it.

00:26:30.550 --> 00:26:32.510
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum:
We could do that next.

00:26:32.510 --> 00:26:34.150
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: It's African.

00:26:34.150 --> 00:26:36.550
That's only partly glib.

00:26:43.290 --> 00:26:47.050
Well, there are several
ways to think of it.

00:26:47.050 --> 00:26:49.110
You could think of it
very musicologically

00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:53.260
and say do we actually find
swing rhythm in Africa?

00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:54.560
I think we do.

00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:57.390
And I think it's, you
could point to some places.

00:26:57.390 --> 00:26:59.610
They're not always where
you'd expect to find them.

00:26:59.610 --> 00:27:00.910
But they're nonetheless there.

00:27:00.910 --> 00:27:03.750
And when someone would say well,

00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:06.420
so-and-so region doesn't
sound anything like that.

00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:07.720
Well, that's true.

00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:09.020
Africa's a very complex place.

00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:10.320
So put it in that big a,

00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:13.400
to put it in that big a
category is a problem.

00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:16.570
But then we don't have any
trouble saying European,

00:27:16.570 --> 00:27:18.930
and Europe's full of
diversity from top to bottom.

00:27:18.930 --> 00:27:22.230
And from north to south Europe,

00:27:22.230 --> 00:27:24.020
performance styles are
radically different.

00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:28.370
And so I, I don't
feel bad about that.

00:27:28.370 --> 00:27:30.520
Are we saying that
there's something

00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:32.990
in African American music you're
not going to find anywhere else?

00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:35.880
Yes. I'll start with
the obvious one.

00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:38.360
I mean, I, I say this, and
I'm violating my own rules.

00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:40.920
You don't say anything
is the first or the only.

00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:44.240
But you know show
me if I'm wrong.

00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:49.110
Simultaneous improvised
collective music is not found

00:27:49.110 --> 00:27:50.410
anywhere else.

00:27:50.410 --> 00:27:51.710
At least not at my knowledge.

00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:58.220
That is the musicians come in
with only the smallest of what?

00:27:58.220 --> 00:28:00.660
Smallest framework to
work with, maybe harmonic,

00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:02.440
maybe rhythmic, whatever.

00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:05.720
And they proceed to collectively
with separate lines,

00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:07.830
without rehearsal,
without planning

00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:09.640
to make these lines
weave together.

00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:10.940
And the wonderful
part of at least

00:28:10.940 --> 00:28:13.380
in its earliest years
is they never clash.

00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:15.460
You can't find let's say
an early New Orleans record

00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:18.370
where there was, some
musician's really playing wrong.

00:28:18.370 --> 00:28:20.700
So somehow they've
got this all flowing.

00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:26.230
I think this is one huge,
enormous kind of distinction.

00:28:26.230 --> 00:28:27.530
But there are others.

00:28:27.530 --> 00:28:28.830
The idea of multiple rhythms,

00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:30.130
putting rhythms on
top of each other.

00:28:30.130 --> 00:28:31.430
Not that it doesn't
happen in Europe.

00:28:31.430 --> 00:28:33.800
It just doesn't happen much.

00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:37.250
Three over four.

00:28:37.250 --> 00:28:41.260
Things that drummers in
Europe didn't know how

00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:43.650
to do until very recently.

00:28:43.650 --> 00:28:49.880
And the amazing part was it took
one drummer playing a drum set,

00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:52.500
an American invention.

00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:53.800
To do this.

00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:56.460
Now in Africa, you have multiple
drummers playing at once.

00:28:56.460 --> 00:28:58.380
But not the same
drumming pattern.

00:28:58.380 --> 00:28:59.830
In Europe, in America
and England,

00:28:59.830 --> 00:29:01.660
you had them playing
the same pattern.

00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:03.020
So it had this distinction.

00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:04.480
The, the remarkable thing is

00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:07.520
that one drummer could
incorporate all the rhythms

00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:10.630
of three or four drummers in
one set using feet and hands

00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:12.070
in four distinctive ways.

00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:14.330
I remember saying something
to a class once about that

00:29:14.330 --> 00:29:19.890
and saying the, in Africa where
you have these multiple drums.

00:29:19.890 --> 00:29:24.230
They often are, the rhythms are
associated with certain deities.

00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:27.470
And they may be named even,
even baptized with names,

00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:30.080
and rubbed with oils
and so forth.

00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:31.590
And the student raised
their hand and said,

00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:33.920
"So if one drummer is
playing all the drums,

00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:37.120
it's like polytheism, right?"

00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:40.200
[Laughter] I said,
"If, if you will.

00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:43.360
Why not?" But I had
thought that the drum--

00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:45.610
if you look at a drum
kit, even the modern one.

00:29:45.610 --> 00:29:47.380
The drums aren't all
from the same place.

00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:50.990
The cymbals are still
primarily a Turkish phenomenon.

00:29:50.990 --> 00:29:53.910
You know? Zildjian is
still the state of the art.

00:29:53.910 --> 00:29:57.640
Stamped with, oftentimes
with Arabic letters, is it?

00:29:57.640 --> 00:30:03.160
Tom-toms came in from not
from Native Americans.

00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:07.050
But from China and the
early ones look like that.

00:30:07.050 --> 00:30:10.200
The, the, they were, used

00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:13.610
to be little bell-like
things made of wood.

00:30:13.610 --> 00:30:15.540
Now they're, you don't
see them too often,

00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:18.220
the wood blocks were
originally called temple blocks.

00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:20.500
They were coming in from
Buddhists and others.

00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:22.980
It's like you're seeing the
collapse of empire in this set.

00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:25.270
You know, someone just said,
"I want all that stuff.

00:30:25.270 --> 00:30:26.570
Bring it in."

00:30:26.570 --> 00:30:28.340
And then you watch very
rapidly how it changes.

00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:29.800
The cymbals are first
of all hanging.

00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:34.500
And the drummers only play on
one thing at a time at first.

00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:36.080
Then they'll switch
to the drums.

00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:37.890
And then somebody
figures out a way

00:30:37.890 --> 00:30:41.380
that they can make the
cymbals die faster.

00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:42.800
Or bring it down into reach.

00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:45.050
And then they put two together
so they're clapped shut.

00:30:45.050 --> 00:30:46.900
And then you put a pedal on it.

00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:51.460
And then up to, I don't know,
into the teens and twenties,

00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:53.430
drummers were still
kicking the bass drum.

00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:54.950
They still called
it a kick drum.

00:30:54.950 --> 00:30:56.250
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: No pedal?

00:30:56.250 --> 00:31:00.120
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: Yeah, and even,
even when they put the pedal in,

00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:02.400
some drummers were still
kicking it for effect

00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:04.400
because it was a
different kind of thing.

00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:06.930
That plus, if I can
get really weird here.

00:31:06.930 --> 00:31:09.250
The brushes.

00:31:09.250 --> 00:31:10.550
We're still talking these,

00:31:10.550 --> 00:31:12.350
no the brushes are
certainly not European.

00:31:12.350 --> 00:31:15.890
They look to me.

00:31:15.890 --> 00:31:21.060
Well, let me put it this way.

00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:23.610
The first brushes weren't
brushes for [inaudible].

00:31:23.610 --> 00:31:25.690
They were fly swatters.

00:31:25.690 --> 00:31:28.300
They were portable fly swatters.

00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:30.430
Now we're getting into--

00:31:30.430 --> 00:31:33.850
with that we're getting
into African--

00:31:33.850 --> 00:31:35.390
what are those things called?

00:31:35.390 --> 00:31:38.430
You see them-- Eddie
Murphy used to use them,

00:31:38.430 --> 00:31:40.970
pretending to be an African,
swirling this thing around.

00:31:40.970 --> 00:31:43.200
Fly swat-- you know
[inaudible] kind of fly swatter.

00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:45.310
Am I getting arcane
enough with this?

00:31:45.310 --> 00:31:47.010
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: Maybe.

00:31:47.010 --> 00:31:50.000
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: It's also the
way the instruments are played.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.570
And bending notes.

00:31:53.570 --> 00:31:56.720
I mean, I don't mean
just Blues influence.

00:31:56.720 --> 00:32:00.920
I mean, making the instrument
do what it's not supposed to do.

00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:07.210
Which is now I know an
Avant Garde technique.

00:32:07.210 --> 00:32:10.010
But it, you'll know
this very well.

00:32:10.010 --> 00:32:15.290
But the 1964 Carnegie Hall
concert with Miles Davis.

00:32:15.290 --> 00:32:17.540
He plays My Funny Valentine.

00:32:17.540 --> 00:32:22.820
And he opens by fingering
the horn correctly

00:32:22.820 --> 00:32:24.230
but with no vibrato.

00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:26.250
There's no quiver to is.

00:32:26.250 --> 00:32:28.220
And rather awkwardly.

00:32:28.220 --> 00:32:30.280
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da.

00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:31.580
Like an amateur.

00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:32.880
Da, da, da, da.

00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:34.990
And to an audience that's just
paid big bucks to see this.

00:32:34.990 --> 00:32:36.290
This must be kind of strange

00:32:36.290 --> 00:32:37.760
to see a great trumpet
player sounding

00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:39.690
like he didn't know how
to play the trumpet.

00:32:39.690 --> 00:32:41.800
But then the next part is
supposed to go up, the tune.

00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:43.100
Da, da, da, da.

00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:44.400
He goes down, da, da, da.

00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:45.900
He goes down so low
that it sounds

00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:47.820
like his other instrument.

00:32:47.820 --> 00:32:50.030
Then he comes soaring back up,

00:32:50.030 --> 00:32:51.700
way over where the
other part was.

00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:54.590
And then stops, then
stops playing

00:32:54.590 --> 00:32:56.700
for about one bar and a half.

00:32:56.700 --> 00:32:59.850
That'd be about five seconds..

00:32:59.850 --> 00:33:03.000
And the feeling in the
audience was he's lost.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.960
He comes back in on a note
played on the third valve

00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:08.560
which can't be played
on the third valve.

00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:10.310
That is he's forcing
it with his lip.

00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:13.240
He could have played it on
the right valve, but instead,

00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:17.240
he's playing it on the
wrong one and it's wavering.

00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:18.540
[Makes trumpet sound].

00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:21.820
Now, that's a tour de force of
saying I'm not going to play

00:33:21.820 --> 00:33:24.720
like this instrument's
meant to be played.

00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:26.240
I'm going to have
my audience hang

00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:28.260
on the idea is this
guy a complete fraud?

00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:31.030
Is he losing it?

00:33:31.030 --> 00:33:33.490
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: There are
different kinds of virtuosity.

00:33:33.490 --> 00:33:36.200
It's not all about velocity.

00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:38.500
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: Yes, and then in
Miles' case, he would say some--

00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:41.480
sometimes you should play less.

00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:42.780
Well, you know the secret.

00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:45.060
Herbie Hancock said, "When I
asked Miles what I should be

00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:48.380
playing,"-- that
was, how's he put it?

00:33:48.380 --> 00:33:50.250
I don't know what
I'm supposed to play.

00:33:50.250 --> 00:33:51.570
And he said, "Then don't play."

00:33:51.570 --> 00:33:56.200
And then at one point
he said, Miles said,

00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:58.960
"Try sitting on your
right hand."

00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:01.330
So he's left with
nothing but the chords.

00:34:01.330 --> 00:34:04.760
Then Miles said, "Now sit
on the other hand, too."

00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:06.060
[Laughter]

00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:07.360
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: Yeah!

00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:08.660
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: So
it's, it becomes.

00:34:08.660 --> 00:34:10.220
And then Count Basie used to
say, it's not what he plays,

00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:11.770
it's what he doesn't play.

00:34:11.770 --> 00:34:13.960
Which they also said of
Paul McCartney playing bass.

00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:16.090
But you know.

00:34:16.090 --> 00:34:17.390
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum:
That's also a variation

00:34:17.390 --> 00:34:20.930
on play what you don't know.

00:34:20.930 --> 00:34:22.230
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: Which
is what Miles said

00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:24.210
to John McLaughlin, right?

00:34:24.210 --> 00:34:27.780
He said, "Play the guitar like
you'd never played it before."

00:34:27.780 --> 00:34:30.440
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: So Miles has
come up several times already

00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:33.090
in our conversation and we
were talking about him earlier.

00:34:33.090 --> 00:34:35.770
It's unavoidable.

00:34:35.770 --> 00:34:39.390
So you wrote a book about Miles.

00:34:39.390 --> 00:34:45.150
And you know I mean we
all know that jazz fans

00:34:45.150 --> 00:34:51.530
in particular hold very
close to their methodologies.

00:34:51.530 --> 00:34:56.140
There's ideas that people have
about these figures they love.

00:34:56.140 --> 00:34:58.790
Or the music that they love.

00:34:58.790 --> 00:35:03.980
How beholden are
you to these myths?

00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:06.890
Are you seeking to unravel them?

00:35:06.890 --> 00:35:11.700
Or what is your intent when
you're trying to do research?

00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:13.170
How can you tell a story

00:35:13.170 --> 00:35:15.420
that hasn't been told
100 times already?

00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:17.070
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: Well, the only,
the only books I ever wrote were

00:35:17.070 --> 00:35:19.900
on things that I thought people
would never write on them.

00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:22.060
And they were fascinating to me.

00:35:22.060 --> 00:35:23.360
That was the case with Sun Ra.

00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:26.220
Or the stories about
them was so wrong.

00:35:26.220 --> 00:35:27.580
Like Jelly Roll Morton.

00:35:27.580 --> 00:35:29.130
Who was, who was
an intellectual.

00:35:29.130 --> 00:35:33.300
I mean he was an
extremely shrewd guy.

00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:38.010
Or Miles which I was very
suspicious of the Miles stories.

00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:44.100
They were, they were serving
a certain, should I say?

00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:46.850
Male purpose in the
fifties and sixties.

00:35:46.850 --> 00:35:50.250
There was similar, similar
to sports hero stories.

00:35:50.250 --> 00:35:53.290
I was very suspicious
about that kind of thing

00:35:53.290 --> 00:35:55.510
because I was getting
crosswinds from musicians

00:35:55.510 --> 00:35:56.910
that didn't sound the same.

00:35:56.910 --> 00:36:01.000
Yes, Miles could be
at least annoying

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:04.850
and often very nasty and cruel.

00:36:04.850 --> 00:36:08.760
But he was also an
extraordinarily generous

00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:11.800
and thoughtful person.

00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:13.910
And I thought, this is
something worth exploring

00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:15.510
to see how you pull
all of it together.

00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:18.370
I mean, I already passed the
point where I thought what?

00:36:18.370 --> 00:36:20.840
That to be great, you
don't have to be nice.

00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:23.370
Nice people-- in fact, most
great people aren't very nice.

00:36:23.370 --> 00:36:26.570
Because they're, they're so
committed to what they do.

00:36:26.570 --> 00:36:29.660
So one single person,
single purpose

00:36:29.660 --> 00:36:32.380
that they devote themselves to.

00:36:32.380 --> 00:36:35.380
And everything else
falls apart around them.

00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:37.210
So I wasn't surprised by that.

00:36:37.210 --> 00:36:38.510
But what I was surprised

00:36:38.510 --> 00:36:42.960
by was how much he was thinking
ahead of the other people.

00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:44.390
And why he would do that.

00:36:44.390 --> 00:36:47.040
And why he would be breaking
the rules constantly.

00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:50.450
So this guy who has
all the, the trappings

00:36:50.450 --> 00:36:55.450
of a super-macho
star, if you want.

00:36:55.450 --> 00:36:59.410
Will nonetheless do things
which no macho person would do

00:36:59.410 --> 00:37:02.320
such as play Broadway
show tunes in the fifties.

00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:03.620
Whoa, you know?

00:37:03.620 --> 00:37:05.590
The only two people
to pull that off were,

00:37:05.590 --> 00:37:08.610
were Chet Baker and he.

00:37:08.610 --> 00:37:11.620
Chet Baker had a voice
that sounded female.

00:37:11.620 --> 00:37:14.700
So you know he crossed
a lot of borders.

00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:18.870
So I'm wondering, who else,
who else is going to play

00:37:18.870 --> 00:37:25.100
as a super cool tune either
Surrey with a Fringe on Top,

00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:27.920
really corny Oklahoma tune?

00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:30.120
And even then.

00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:36.450
Or maybe Bye-bye Blackbird,
an ancient song which--

00:37:36.450 --> 00:37:38.010
so what does he do
with both of them?

00:37:38.010 --> 00:37:41.720
He plays them so slow, they
lose their original feel.

00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:43.610
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum:
He strips away.

00:37:43.610 --> 00:37:50.250
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: Yeah, and Bye-Bye
Blackbird he plays [hums]

00:37:50.250 --> 00:37:53.020
and drops the "blackbird."

00:37:53.020 --> 00:37:57.350
[Hums] something a singer
would never be able to do.

00:37:57.350 --> 00:37:58.650
So he's [inaudible].

00:37:58.650 --> 00:38:01.150
And then when you look at
some of his early work,

00:38:01.150 --> 00:38:06.440
it's just the arrangements
that we use for his,

00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:10.310
birth of the cool recordings.

00:38:10.310 --> 00:38:14.640
There is a kind of erasure
going on there, too.

00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:17.010
He'll take a tune
that's based roughly

00:38:17.010 --> 00:38:19.810
around a George Shearing
composition.

00:38:19.810 --> 00:38:21.660
A kind of quasi-be-bop player.

00:38:21.660 --> 00:38:24.040
And he'll drop a lot
of the harmonics of it.

00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:28.260
So there's empty spaces, and
it's floating in between.

00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:31.700
I notice that incidentally,

00:38:31.700 --> 00:38:35.140
I just remembered
something on erase.

00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:41.920
If I can remember
the details of this.

00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:45.700
Rauschenberg, the painter, got
the idea that it would be cool

00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:48.800
to erase a famous
painter's painting.

00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:52.650
Then put his name on
it for erasing it.

00:38:52.650 --> 00:38:56.530
So he went to de Kooning and
said you can't erase a painting.

00:38:56.530 --> 00:38:57.830
So he settled on a drawing.

00:38:57.830 --> 00:38:59.510
Have you got a drawing
I could erase and do it?

00:38:59.510 --> 00:39:01.390
De Kooning said,
"This is stupid."

00:39:01.390 --> 00:39:04.390
[Laughter] He said, "I know,"
he said, "but I want to do it."

00:39:04.390 --> 00:39:05.790
So de Kooning goes
through a lot of stuff.

00:39:05.790 --> 00:39:07.090
So he pulls out something.

00:39:07.090 --> 00:39:08.390
He says, "Here."

00:39:08.390 --> 00:39:09.690
And so he takes it.

00:39:09.690 --> 00:39:10.990
By the way, he didn't
completely erase it

00:39:10.990 --> 00:39:12.290
or that would sort of spoil it.

00:39:12.290 --> 00:39:13.590
You could kind of see it.

00:39:13.590 --> 00:39:16.140
But it's mostly gone, and he
wrote his name at the bottom.

00:39:16.140 --> 00:39:17.440
End of story.

00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:18.740
And he's famous.

00:39:18.740 --> 00:39:20.040
Sold for a lot of money.

00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:23.280
Well, Elaine de Kooning, de
Kooning, and Willem de Kooning

00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:25.830
and Elaine de Kooning,
both writers,

00:39:25.830 --> 00:39:30.650
both painters, were
big jazz people.

00:39:30.650 --> 00:39:33.600
And Elaine did a charcoal sketch

00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:35.990
of Ornette Coleman
which is quite good.

00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:38.380
I, I have a copy of it.

00:39:38.380 --> 00:39:40.530
And it's signed Elaine
de Kooning.

00:39:40.530 --> 00:39:43.130
So I was at-- you can see
it on the web, by the way.

00:39:43.130 --> 00:39:47.300
I was at Ornette Coleman's
birthday party, and he passed

00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:50.120
out copies of these as sort,
no, it was a Christmas Party.

00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:51.790
Christmas presents.

00:39:51.790 --> 00:39:54.680
I look at it, and Elaine de
Kooning's name has been erased,

00:39:54.680 --> 00:39:56.140
and his name was there.

00:39:56.140 --> 00:39:59.170
So I said, "I bet this
is by Elaine de Kooning."

00:39:59.170 --> 00:40:02.050
He said, "Yeah, but
it's me, it's not her."

00:40:02.050 --> 00:40:07.630
So somehow jazz history
[laughter] walked back

00:40:07.630 --> 00:40:08.930
into art history.

00:40:08.930 --> 00:40:11.210
Erasure.

00:40:11.210 --> 00:40:17.210
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: So
with Miles, are there any,

00:40:17.210 --> 00:40:21.770
I mean you, you immersed
yourself in what is out there.

00:40:21.770 --> 00:40:25.500
You interviewed all
the right people.

00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:27.740
Are there any unanswered
questions

00:40:27.740 --> 00:40:30.880
in your mind about Miles?

00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:32.340
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: Well, there's
always something unanswered.

00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:37.560
I mean, I don't ever claim
to know anyone that well.

00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:39.720
I mean, I'm not surprised
by much

00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:42.480
that people do unless it's
completely outrageous.

00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:46.790
I mean, how do people hold
values that seem contradictory?

00:40:46.790 --> 00:40:48.090
How do they operate in that?

00:40:48.090 --> 00:40:51.340
How do they, how do they move

00:40:51.340 --> 00:40:53.140
between different
behavior levels?

00:40:53.140 --> 00:40:57.310
How can they be at different
levels of society and do that

00:40:57.310 --> 00:41:00.060
and still maintain
some kind of integrity?

00:41:00.060 --> 00:41:04.640
The kind of thing that most of
us find hard to do, I think.

00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:08.030
It's people who, who
are as comfortable

00:41:08.030 --> 00:41:10.390
with the maintenance
people as they are

00:41:10.390 --> 00:41:13.660
with the CEO are rare
unless they're exposed-- .

00:41:13.660 --> 00:41:14.970
What's the word I want for that?

00:41:14.970 --> 00:41:21.310
A certain kind of character
who, kind of person who says,

00:41:21.310 --> 00:41:23.540
"Your mother just died.

00:41:23.540 --> 00:41:25.430
Let's go on a vacation."

00:41:25.430 --> 00:41:31.740
Or for jazz context, the great
Latin drummer whose name is

00:41:31.740 --> 00:41:33.970
slipping away from me.

00:41:33.970 --> 00:41:35.950
But Dizzy Gillespie-- .

00:41:35.950 --> 00:41:37.250
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: Chano Pozo.

00:41:37.250 --> 00:41:39.400
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: Chano Pozo,
when he was shot to death

00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:45.430
in a Harlem bar, it said that
someone walked into Birdland

00:41:45.430 --> 00:41:48.030
and yelled out, "Chano
Pozo's bee killed."

00:41:48.030 --> 00:41:49.990
And somebody at the bar
said, "Never mind that,

00:41:49.990 --> 00:41:52.170
how was his last set?"

00:41:52.170 --> 00:41:54.960
Well, it's probably untrue,
but you, the spirit of it-- .

00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:56.310
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum:
It's a good story.

00:41:56.310 --> 00:41:57.610
Apocryphal or not.

00:41:57.610 --> 00:41:58.910
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: But it gets,
it gets something out.

00:41:58.910 --> 00:42:00.290
And maybe that's the
way we should operate.

00:42:00.290 --> 00:42:02.610
How was their last set?

00:42:02.610 --> 00:42:05.610
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: What did you
think of Miles' autobiography?

00:42:05.610 --> 00:42:13.950
First, first of all, do you
think it captured his voice?

00:42:13.950 --> 00:42:16.820
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: Everyone
said it did.

00:42:24.150 --> 00:42:27.040
To the degree that he
talked too much, yes.

00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:30.460
He would have said a lot less
and no matter what it is,

00:42:30.460 --> 00:42:33.000
he would have said less.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:36.480
I can't get across
how that works.

00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:39.210
Well, a small case did happen.

00:42:39.210 --> 00:42:42.980
Someone who brought their young
child up, ten-year-old kid.

00:42:42.980 --> 00:42:44.970
Said, "My son's only ten,
but he plays trumpet.

00:42:44.970 --> 00:42:46.270
He loves your music," and so on.

00:42:46.270 --> 00:42:47.840
And the kid said, "I
really love your music."

00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:49.190
Miles says, "You're
only ten years old.

00:42:49.190 --> 00:42:51.130
What do you know?"

00:42:51.130 --> 00:42:54.740
That's a cruel thing to say.

00:42:54.740 --> 00:42:58.610
But it's true.

00:42:58.610 --> 00:43:02.530
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: Speaking
of true, I know that you,

00:43:02.530 --> 00:43:07.330
the tapes of the
interviews that formed

00:43:07.330 --> 00:43:10.680
that autobiography
are a chomper.

00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:15.790
And you have read the
transcripts of those tapes.

00:43:15.790 --> 00:43:23.100
How accurate is what is in
the autobiography as opposed

00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:25.840
to what is in the transcripts?

00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:27.510
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: Well, to
answer that, I'd have to say

00:43:27.510 --> 00:43:33.090
that when you move from
interview to anything else other

00:43:33.090 --> 00:43:34.570
than quoting one-liners.

00:43:34.570 --> 00:43:38.010
You have to create a narrative.

00:43:38.010 --> 00:43:39.310
You have to create something

00:43:39.310 --> 00:43:40.850
with a beginning, a
middle, and an end.

00:43:40.850 --> 00:43:42.650
And in this case,
it's a life story.

00:43:42.650 --> 00:43:45.890
And you have natural
beginning, middles, and ends.

00:43:45.890 --> 00:43:48.120
And you have to make
those things work.

00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:50.370
And the same thing is true
whether you have an interview

00:43:50.370 --> 00:43:54.320
or letters or, or whatever.

00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:55.660
Overheard conversations.

00:43:55.660 --> 00:43:57.760
You're still going to have to
make them fit those things.

00:43:57.760 --> 00:44:00.900
To that degree, no
biography is ever accurate.

00:44:00.900 --> 00:44:05.570
It's always, it's always going
to create a flow, a flowchart

00:44:05.570 --> 00:44:08.680
or a timeline which is not.

00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:10.050
Which may be correct
historically,

00:44:10.050 --> 00:44:12.240
but that's not the way
it was lived and felt.

00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:15.540
If you, if you're not very
careful, and most aren't,

00:44:15.540 --> 00:44:17.320
you begin to say
how the person felt.

00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:19.850
And the kind of biography
I really hate says,

00:44:19.850 --> 00:44:21.400
"He must have felt.

00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:22.960
He probably thought."

00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:24.840
And most of them say this.

00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:27.880
And all you're hearing is some
fool who's, who's conjecturing

00:44:27.880 --> 00:44:29.180
to keep the story going.

00:44:29.180 --> 00:44:32.380
Well, we all do that
when we're trying

00:44:32.380 --> 00:44:33.680
to tell a story to someone.

00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:35.030
You know, what happened
yesterday, you,

00:44:35.030 --> 00:44:37.390
you tend to throw things in.

00:44:37.390 --> 00:44:40.080
I said this to him and
he was saying so-and-so.

00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:43.860
Well, that plus the
fact that you look at a,

00:44:43.860 --> 00:44:45.390
you look at an interview.

00:44:45.390 --> 00:44:47.920
And interviews don't
flow that nicely

00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:50.230
and they're not chronological
usually.

00:44:50.230 --> 00:44:53.040
So a lot of juggling's
got to go on.

00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:54.940
And then to keep
the narrative going,

00:44:54.940 --> 00:45:00.710
you can't possibly use
those quotes sequentially.

00:45:00.710 --> 00:45:05.040
And what I, I found was that
this was where it was departing

00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:07.620
from its-- you have a choice.

00:45:07.620 --> 00:45:09.700
Either to leave it out
or make it scattered.

00:45:09.700 --> 00:45:13.550
Now i-- I'll come back
to that in just a second.

00:45:13.550 --> 00:45:15.620
This, they tried to keep
the narrative going.

00:45:15.620 --> 00:45:19.420
This is [inaudible] and
frequently this required leaving

00:45:19.420 --> 00:45:22.020
out things, and that's
part of the game, I guess.

00:45:22.020 --> 00:45:25.740
And this was changing
the details of it.

00:45:25.740 --> 00:45:27.040
And it's readable.

00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:28.340
As a result, it got
very good reviews.

00:45:28.340 --> 00:45:29.640
The book's still for sale.

00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:30.940
Mine's not.

00:45:30.940 --> 00:45:32.240
I mean, you know, whatever.

00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:36.260
And in fact, this
is what really hurt.

00:45:36.260 --> 00:45:37.890
When I got reviewed
in the New York Times.

00:45:37.890 --> 00:45:40.380
I got two bad reviews
in one week.

00:45:40.380 --> 00:45:42.730
Nobody gets two reviews
in one week to begin with.

00:45:42.730 --> 00:45:44.310
That was really weird.

00:45:44.310 --> 00:45:46.650
My agent said, "Well, it means
it's really important, right?"

00:45:46.650 --> 00:45:49.490
I said, "Yeah, right."

00:45:49.490 --> 00:45:56.000
One rather famous person said
my book should be read by people

00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:58.080
who are really interested
in Miles.

00:45:58.080 --> 00:45:59.380
And Miles' book is full

00:45:59.380 --> 00:46:01.160
of inaccuracies and
made-up stories.

00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:02.590
But his is much more
fun to read.

00:46:02.590 --> 00:46:04.630
Well I grant that.

00:46:04.630 --> 00:46:05.930
That's why it was done.

00:46:05.930 --> 00:46:07.770
That's why it's-- but
I'm not writing it,

00:46:07.770 --> 00:46:10.750
I'm not writing books
for fun, I guess.

00:46:10.750 --> 00:46:12.800
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: Why are
you writing these books?

00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:15.770
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: In that case,
to correct what was written.

00:46:15.770 --> 00:46:20.200
And because I thought,
I thought every writer.

00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:23.000
I thought, I know, every writer
who had written about him cut

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:25.110
out the parts of his
music they didn't like.

00:46:25.110 --> 00:46:27.390
And I thought that
was unconscionable.

00:46:27.390 --> 00:46:30.640
That's like saying
of a business person.

00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:32.120
They were you know
dealing in gold,

00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:33.420
and then they were
dealing in something else.

00:46:33.420 --> 00:46:34.720
You decide I don't
like the gold part.

00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:36.020
I'll leave that out.

00:46:36.020 --> 00:46:37.320
Sounded dumb.

00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:38.620
You know, he should--
I don't want him-- .

00:46:38.620 --> 00:46:40.590
It creates a character
that's totally different

00:46:40.590 --> 00:46:41.890
than any other one.

00:46:41.890 --> 00:46:44.040
Or a person who, who
beat up his partner.

00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:48.260
I mean, leave it out and
you've got another story

00:46:48.260 --> 00:46:49.560
of another person.

00:46:49.560 --> 00:46:52.260
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: Can you
give some examples of things

00:46:52.260 --> 00:46:55.980
that are commonly left
out of these biographies?

00:46:55.980 --> 00:46:59.430
Not just of the Miles, but
let's say the Billie Holiday.

00:46:59.430 --> 00:47:03.340
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: I think the first
thing that's left out I'd love

00:47:03.340 --> 00:47:05.700
to be able to do that
I can't do is to talk

00:47:05.700 --> 00:47:07.840
about just how boring
life can be.

00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:10.710
Even when you're wealthy and
you're a start and so forth.

00:47:10.710 --> 00:47:12.110
There's a lot of boredom.

00:47:12.110 --> 00:47:14.150
I mean, I sensed a little
of this at a low level

00:47:14.150 --> 00:47:16.650
as a traveling musician and.

00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:20.340
I mean just think.

00:47:20.340 --> 00:47:21.650
Let's leave aside
music for a second.

00:47:21.650 --> 00:47:25.510
What if you're really a
star, a super, super figure?

00:47:25.510 --> 00:47:28.620
And you've just appeared
at Kennedy Center.

00:47:28.620 --> 00:47:30.590
You've had people leaping
to their feet and so on.

00:47:30.590 --> 00:47:32.810
And you go back to the hotel.

00:47:32.810 --> 00:47:34.500
That's a big jump.

00:47:34.500 --> 00:47:37.500
What are you-- watch
CNN or something?

00:47:37.500 --> 00:47:40.610
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: Do
your laundry in the sink.

00:47:40.610 --> 00:47:41.910
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: Yeah, it's-- .

00:47:41.910 --> 00:47:43.420
One way you handle
it is make your life

00:47:43.420 --> 00:47:46.720
into a kind of a, I don't know.

00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:48.850
I don't think a lot of
people handle it, frankly.

00:47:48.850 --> 00:47:50.430
I think it causes
them a lot of grief.

00:47:50.430 --> 00:47:52.970
But one is to try to
believe your own propaganda.

00:47:52.970 --> 00:47:55.650
Believe the audience and
say, "I'm always that.

00:47:55.650 --> 00:47:57.910
I'm always on."

00:47:57.910 --> 00:48:02.390
And I think musicians have
a different take on this.

00:48:02.390 --> 00:48:06.110
I think, particularly those who
aren't singers because they,

00:48:06.110 --> 00:48:08.140
they're like abstract painters.

00:48:08.140 --> 00:48:11.300
They're not, they're not
saying this is reality.

00:48:11.300 --> 00:48:12.710
They're saying this
is in my head.

00:48:12.710 --> 00:48:14.010
It's a feeling.

00:48:14.010 --> 00:48:16.580
So I don't have to
live with that feeling.

00:48:16.580 --> 00:48:18.900
Although some do.

00:48:18.900 --> 00:48:24.390
Miles and Chet Baker were
cool characters in their time.

00:48:24.390 --> 00:48:28.110
They walked, talked,
they had minimal speech.

00:48:28.110 --> 00:48:29.890
They, they stared at people.

00:48:29.890 --> 00:48:31.790
I mean, that's why
they're so quotable

00:48:31.790 --> 00:48:34.050
because they so, said so little.

00:48:34.050 --> 00:48:35.350
You know this.

00:48:35.350 --> 00:48:37.130
In fact, I compared
the two of their,

00:48:37.130 --> 00:48:38.630
their, the way they moved.

00:48:38.630 --> 00:48:39.930
They were similar players.

00:48:39.930 --> 00:48:43.920
And Miles' story, stories
about Miles always ended

00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:49.650
with some very funny but
rude or violent comment.

00:48:49.650 --> 00:48:53.010
Every story about Chet
Baker ended sadly.

00:48:53.010 --> 00:48:54.310
There was nothing
funny about it.

00:48:54.310 --> 00:48:55.610
I mean, the funniest
one I know is

00:48:55.610 --> 00:48:58.310
when he met Benito
Mussolini's son.

00:48:58.310 --> 00:48:59.610
Who was a jazz pianist.

00:48:59.610 --> 00:49:00.990
You know who I mean, right?

00:49:00.990 --> 00:49:03.070
He said, have I got it right?

00:49:03.070 --> 00:49:05.270
"It was a drag what
happened to your dad."

00:49:05.270 --> 00:49:10.130
I mean, that wasn't meant
to be funny but [laughter].

00:49:10.130 --> 00:49:12.990
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: But
this is what gets quoted

00:49:12.990 --> 00:49:14.290
over and over again.

00:49:14.290 --> 00:49:15.950
And this is what
I mean about-- .

00:49:15.950 --> 00:49:17.490
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: Bob Dylan
is experiencing this

00:49:17.490 --> 00:49:18.790
by the way, you know.

00:49:18.790 --> 00:49:24.190
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: Yeah, it's,
there's this process of sort of,

00:49:24.190 --> 00:49:27.510
I don't know if it's
romanticizing suffering

00:49:27.510 --> 00:49:30.770
or tragic, or tragically
misunderstood.

00:49:30.770 --> 00:49:38.050
Or, or what we think artists are
supposed to represent for us.

00:49:38.050 --> 00:49:43.430
But I sense that for the
readers of these biographies,

00:49:43.430 --> 00:49:47.020
and I'm assuming, I mean maybe
I should ask you straight up.

00:49:47.020 --> 00:49:48.410
Who are you writing for?

00:49:48.410 --> 00:49:51.370
Are you writing for
the knowledgeable?

00:49:51.370 --> 00:49:53.840
Are you writing for
the general audience?

00:49:53.840 --> 00:49:57.240
I mean, nobody gets rich
writing jazz biographies.

00:49:57.240 --> 00:49:58.600
So why are you doing it?

00:49:58.600 --> 00:50:00.840
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: I actually never
thought of it which is a flaw.

00:50:00.840 --> 00:50:02.650
You know, you should
always create your audience,

00:50:02.650 --> 00:50:04.340
not assume it.

00:50:04.340 --> 00:50:06.830
I hope somebody's
there to read it.

00:50:06.830 --> 00:50:08.960
I mean, from the
very first words,

00:50:08.960 --> 00:50:11.770
you start shaping an audience
and somebody goes, "That's it,

00:50:11.770 --> 00:50:13.070
I'm not going to read anymore."

00:50:13.070 --> 00:50:14.510
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: Is
that how you approach this?

00:50:14.510 --> 00:50:16.050
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: I just, I
just started writing it.

00:50:16.050 --> 00:50:18.270
It was not automatic
writing, but it was,

00:50:18.270 --> 00:50:20.020
I had no idea of an audience.

00:50:20.020 --> 00:50:21.900
And I was just thinking

00:50:21.900 --> 00:50:24.610
about Johnny Lydon
has produced several--

00:50:24.610 --> 00:50:28.920
Johnny Rotten as he's know,
Sex Pistols and PI and so on.

00:50:28.920 --> 00:50:31.900
He's written two,
two autobiographies.

00:50:31.900 --> 00:50:33.200
Both of them interesting.

00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:36.390
In the most recent one,
he said, "You know,

00:50:36.390 --> 00:50:39.970
being Johnny Rotten 24 hours
a day was a tough job."

00:50:39.970 --> 00:50:43.330
I knew exactly what
he meant, right?

00:50:43.330 --> 00:50:45.500
He was trying to hold
that character in place.

00:50:45.500 --> 00:50:47.910
You can't do it.

00:50:47.910 --> 00:50:50.210
Actors can't hold
their roles very well.

00:50:50.210 --> 00:50:51.580
Or they don't, you
know, they can try

00:50:51.580 --> 00:50:52.880
to fake their way through.

00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:54.730
But they don't go
through life like that.

00:50:54.730 --> 00:50:56.030
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum:
Besides, it's a,

00:50:56.030 --> 00:50:57.330
it's a contrivance to do that.

00:50:57.330 --> 00:51:01.430
Whereas we always celebrate
people being who they are.

00:51:01.430 --> 00:51:02.920
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: That's why people

00:51:02.920 --> 00:51:06.300
who don't say much have a
better chance of pulling it off.

00:51:06.300 --> 00:51:09.060
It becomes like I think I
said somewhere it's like Da--

00:51:09.060 --> 00:51:12.040
Daisey in the Great Gatsby.

00:51:12.040 --> 00:51:15.770
She spoke so softly
and so little you know,

00:51:15.770 --> 00:51:17.070
you were taken [inaudible].

00:51:17.070 --> 00:51:19.180
Well, I finally read the
first version of Gatsby.

00:51:19.180 --> 00:51:23.150
And she talks a lot more and
is much rougher on her husband.

00:51:23.150 --> 00:51:24.450
But it blows the book.

00:51:24.450 --> 00:51:26.750
I mean, somewhere.

00:51:28.170 --> 00:51:31.090
Oh, it's where the rich,

00:51:31.090 --> 00:51:34.040
the rich Anglo-millionaire
is talking

00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:36.960
about the lower races
in the United States.

00:51:36.960 --> 00:51:38.260
And this is the twenties, right?

00:51:38.260 --> 00:51:40.740
He said, "They're going
to take over the world.

00:51:40.740 --> 00:51:42.770
They're not like really creators

00:51:42.770 --> 00:51:44.070
of the world they're
taking over."

00:51:44.070 --> 00:51:46.560
And suddenly, Daisey wakes
up and says, "Kill them all!

00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:47.860
Kill them all!"

00:51:47.860 --> 00:51:49.770
And he says, "Alright,
don't start with me."

00:51:49.770 --> 00:51:54.490
And then later in the
same exchange, she says,

00:51:54.490 --> 00:51:57.100
"We're all white
people here, you know."

00:51:57.100 --> 00:52:00.690
But that's not a book
that would have sold.

00:52:00.690 --> 00:52:02.620
[Laughter] He took
that stuff out.

00:52:02.620 --> 00:52:05.200
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: As,
as a writer, biographer,

00:52:05.200 --> 00:52:11.520
as a scholar, I'm wondering
how you assess research value.

00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:12.820
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: Research value?

00:52:12.820 --> 00:52:14.120
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum:
Research value.

00:52:14.120 --> 00:52:19.180
And by that I mean when you're
going through papers, let's say.

00:52:19.180 --> 00:52:22.330
What are the kinds of things
that make your eyes light up?

00:52:24.620 --> 00:52:28.660
What's, what's-- where's
the gold in that stuff?

00:52:32.480 --> 00:52:34.810
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: Well I think most
of the time, unless you're going

00:52:34.810 --> 00:52:38.540
to repeat things
that are well known.

00:52:38.540 --> 00:52:42.210
You have to hope that something
is that you haven't seen

00:52:42.210 --> 00:52:45.580
or heard and the problem there
becomes the way I open my

00:52:45.580 --> 00:52:46.880
Miles book.

00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:50.020
I was down in Soho
at a bar in New York.

00:52:50.020 --> 00:52:52.500
And I was talking
about this at the bar.

00:52:52.500 --> 00:52:54.160
And someone overheard
and said, "Miles?"

00:52:54.160 --> 00:52:56.550
And he gives me a
story about Miles.

00:52:56.550 --> 00:52:59.290
And it was outrageous,
both its content,

00:52:59.290 --> 00:53:01.910
but also it was impossible,
given the circumstances.

00:53:01.910 --> 00:53:03.210
So I knew it was made up.

00:53:03.210 --> 00:53:06.750
So I said, "Where'd
you hear that a story?"

00:53:06.750 --> 00:53:10.150
And he goes, "You
want provenience?"

00:53:10.150 --> 00:53:11.690
I mean, he said,
"This, this is--

00:53:11.690 --> 00:53:12.990
we're talking about Miles here.

00:53:12.990 --> 00:53:14.290
Miles belongs to everybody."

00:53:14.290 --> 00:53:15.880
And I said, whoa.

00:53:15.880 --> 00:53:17.180
Now this is interesting.

00:53:17.180 --> 00:53:18.720
If I'm going to write
down everything

00:53:18.720 --> 00:53:20.800
that people tell me he did,

00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:23.060
I can have a fat book
of a lot of stories.

00:53:23.060 --> 00:53:26.300
But if everyone thinks
this character is theirs,

00:53:26.300 --> 00:53:28.980
they're going to be clashing.

00:53:28.980 --> 00:53:30.840
They're going to, you
know, stories won't work.

00:53:30.840 --> 00:53:33.190
And it was bad enough
as what it was.

00:53:33.190 --> 00:53:35.550
So I, I, I was on
guard about this.

00:53:35.550 --> 00:53:38.790
And I, I found this
about sexuality.

00:53:38.790 --> 00:53:41.390
That people will give
you these stories.

00:53:41.390 --> 00:53:44.770
That of a given person, everyone
I've ever written about.

00:53:44.770 --> 00:53:48.980
That seem to be impossibly
sustainable.

00:53:48.980 --> 00:53:53.380
They can't have that much, I
don't want to say versatility.

00:53:53.380 --> 00:53:56.340
It's not about that.

00:53:56.340 --> 00:53:58.680
Their range of sexuality
is impossible,

00:53:58.680 --> 00:54:00.630
or almost impossible
to maintain.

00:54:00.630 --> 00:54:02.930
It would be a full-time
job to do it.

00:54:02.930 --> 00:54:04.230
And you'd have to work at it.

00:54:04.230 --> 00:54:06.180
Which is not exactly what
we think these things should

00:54:06.180 --> 00:54:07.480
be about.

00:54:07.480 --> 00:54:11.430
And slowly you begin to find out
that none if it's quite right.

00:54:11.430 --> 00:54:14.240
That they've taken something
and pushed it further.

00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:16.930
And you know, every now
and then I'd be brought

00:54:16.930 --> 00:54:18.230
up short by somebody.

00:54:18.230 --> 00:54:20.950
So I get a call once
when I was working

00:54:20.950 --> 00:54:23.030
on this Sun Ra book
from Out magazine.

00:54:23.030 --> 00:54:24.820
I don't know whether
they still exist or not.

00:54:24.820 --> 00:54:27.850
They said, "We're interested
in doing a piece on Sun Ra."

00:54:27.850 --> 00:54:30.540
So they started asking some
questions and said, "Ooops,

00:54:30.540 --> 00:54:32.700
not out enough for us."

00:54:32.700 --> 00:54:34.000
That was the end of that, right?

00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:38.380
So they were pulling him
out of the gay realm for me,

00:54:38.380 --> 00:54:40.580
editing him out in that way.

00:54:40.580 --> 00:54:42.560
Miles, people kept
trying to push him back

00:54:42.560 --> 00:54:44.370
in these two, in
these categories.

00:54:44.370 --> 00:54:48.270
I mean, they would, I can,
"So and so was there."

00:54:48.270 --> 00:54:50.350
It's always third
or fourth stories.

00:54:50.350 --> 00:54:52.450
And what are they trying to say?

00:54:52.450 --> 00:54:55.460
That the other one is the
fake and this is the real?

00:54:55.460 --> 00:54:57.700
They're not saying that
both are real, for sure.

00:54:57.700 --> 00:55:03.130
I'm so maybe it's the period
we're in where people want

00:55:03.130 --> 00:55:04.690
to see these kind of-- it's

00:55:04.690 --> 00:55:08.540
like debunking the
character sexually.

00:55:08.540 --> 00:55:12.990
You know? The macho guy
is really the opposite.

00:55:12.990 --> 00:55:16.990
Or you know the wimpy
guy is really macho.

00:55:16.990 --> 00:55:19.630
It, it's-- i don't
know how that works.

00:55:19.630 --> 00:55:21.760
But it's, it's boring to hear.

00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:24.340
And the stories aren't
very interesting.

00:55:24.340 --> 00:55:28.050
I mean look, most
of life is tedious.

00:55:28.050 --> 00:55:32.000
Most of the dialogue is boring.

00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:34.240
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: But
nobody wants to read boring

00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:37.030
or tedious, much less buy it.

00:55:37.030 --> 00:55:42.300
So what they want is
the stuff of heroes.

00:55:42.300 --> 00:55:43.600
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: Well, I
mean, I thought that,

00:55:43.600 --> 00:55:49.430
that a black kid whose
father was an orthodontist,

00:55:49.430 --> 00:55:55.560
who raised prize-winning horses
and bought prize-winning swine

00:55:55.560 --> 00:55:59.880
from Winston Churchill who
studied at Julliard and studied

00:55:59.880 --> 00:56:03.300
with the first trumpet player
with St. Louis Symphony.

00:56:03.300 --> 00:56:07.090
Who was also kind of a
proto-beatnik, a junky,

00:56:07.090 --> 00:56:10.140
street person who
had made films.

00:56:10.140 --> 00:56:12.920
Who had gotten the
highest award.

00:56:12.920 --> 00:56:14.960
Who set fashions and so on.

00:56:14.960 --> 00:56:17.440
I thought that was story enough.

00:56:17.440 --> 00:56:21.270
And I had to get to
people like his tailor.

00:56:21.270 --> 00:56:23.400
But the problem was he
kept shifting styles.

00:56:23.400 --> 00:56:27.650
So I went to the Audubon
Men's Shop in, in Cambridge

00:56:27.650 --> 00:56:32.330
which is the arch-preppy
shop, still is of all time.

00:56:32.330 --> 00:56:33.940
You walk into that shop,
and it's like walking

00:56:33.940 --> 00:56:36.330
into a certain zone of history.

00:56:36.330 --> 00:56:39.680
Now fortunately for me, the
owner was a Miles freak.

00:56:39.680 --> 00:56:45.190
And he saw the humor
of all of this.

00:56:45.190 --> 00:56:48.660
He saw the humor of Miles
coming in with certain fabrics

00:56:48.660 --> 00:56:50.550
and saying, "I want a
suit made like this."

00:56:50.550 --> 00:56:52.540
And they were-- you
know, best [inaudible]

00:56:52.540 --> 00:56:54.150
and I don't know, whatever.

00:56:54.150 --> 00:56:57.460
You know certain kinds of tweed,
and the next time he sees him,

00:56:57.460 --> 00:56:59.780
he's getting Italian suits that
are coming from somewhere else.

00:56:59.780 --> 00:57:01.610
And then he's getting
Japanese clothes

00:57:01.610 --> 00:57:03.100
that are [inaudible] around him.

00:57:03.100 --> 00:57:04.700
Then he's got whatever.

00:57:04.700 --> 00:57:06.810
So he saw the humor of this,

00:57:06.810 --> 00:57:08.990
changing your life
to fit your fashions.

00:57:08.990 --> 00:57:14.440
And when I went to
people like that,

00:57:14.440 --> 00:57:16.590
to see how they would take the--

00:57:16.590 --> 00:57:19.310
what would your tailor
say about you?

00:57:19.310 --> 00:57:22.340
Or I went to his dentist.

00:57:22.340 --> 00:57:23.640
That was interesting.

00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:24.980
His dentist, nice man, retired.

00:57:24.980 --> 00:57:27.090
Said-- he kept changing
the subject.

00:57:27.090 --> 00:57:29.220
He, he said, "You
know Mr. Ellington?"

00:57:29.220 --> 00:57:30.610
I'd say, "No, I don't.

00:57:30.610 --> 00:57:31.910
I know who you mean."

00:57:31.910 --> 00:57:33.210
He said, "Very sweet man.

00:57:33.210 --> 00:57:34.510
He's been one of my
patients for years."

00:57:34.510 --> 00:57:35.910
And I'd say, "Well, please
can we get back to Miles?"

00:57:35.910 --> 00:57:37.210
And he's say, "By the way,

00:57:37.210 --> 00:57:39.650
do you know"-- you
know some singer.

00:57:39.650 --> 00:57:40.950
And I'd say, "No
but you know-- ."

00:57:40.950 --> 00:57:43.440
"It's a sweet lady
and wonderful teeth."

00:57:43.440 --> 00:57:46.630
I'd say, "Dr, can we
talk about Miles?"

00:57:46.630 --> 00:57:49.300
"He wasn't very nice."

00:57:49.300 --> 00:57:52.260
[Laughter] I worked
on a molar-- .

00:57:52.260 --> 00:57:54.890
So it's that kind
of thing, right?

00:57:54.890 --> 00:57:59.100
No story just I worked on this
molar and he wasn't very nice.

00:57:59.100 --> 00:58:01.630
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: How
did you approach the Billie

00:58:01.630 --> 00:58:03.000
Holiday story?

00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:04.700
I mean this is also something

00:58:04.700 --> 00:58:08.830
that the narrative's been
picked over often enough.

00:58:08.830 --> 00:58:10.140
How did you try?

00:58:10.140 --> 00:58:14.250
How were you able to find
something new to say?

00:58:14.250 --> 00:58:17.030
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: Well, I, I
was bothered by the fact

00:58:17.030 --> 00:58:22.290
that the story of her life
had overwhelmed her music.

00:58:22.290 --> 00:58:25.480
And that the very best

00:58:25.480 --> 00:58:28.550
of her music was not
being paid attention

00:58:28.550 --> 00:58:29.850
to even though it was out there.

00:58:29.850 --> 00:58:32.770
It's still out there somewhere.

00:58:32.770 --> 00:58:34.810
And I wanted to make a case

00:58:34.810 --> 00:58:39.070
for her being a really
important 20th century singer

00:58:39.070 --> 00:58:41.840
that set patterns that
you don't maybe recognize.

00:58:41.840 --> 00:58:45.480
Since Frank Sinatra and Amy
Winehouse, all kinds of people.

00:58:45.480 --> 00:58:48.250
And that was, that was actually
a very easy thing to do.

00:58:48.250 --> 00:58:49.640
And I was thinking
not that interesting.

00:58:49.640 --> 00:58:53.830
But as I got into it, I
found these other materials.

00:58:53.830 --> 00:58:57.410
I found, I found stuff from--

00:58:57.410 --> 00:59:00.640
got her co-writer of her,
of her autobiography.

00:59:00.640 --> 00:59:03.690
I found the first draft
of her autobiography

00:59:03.690 --> 00:59:07.510
which had a lot missing
when it went into print.

00:59:07.510 --> 00:59:12.640
I found some people who
that she had had affairs

00:59:12.640 --> 00:59:16.000
with that were quite famous and
were missing from these texts

00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:17.720
for fear of lawsuits
and other things.

00:59:17.720 --> 00:59:21.000
So the, the person who's
self was changing right

00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:22.300
in front of me.

00:59:22.300 --> 00:59:25.930
Here's a woman who we knew
about an abusive husband

00:59:25.930 --> 00:59:28.240
and about gangster boyfriends

00:59:28.240 --> 00:59:30.690
and drug dealers
and times in jail.

00:59:30.690 --> 00:59:33.390
But we didn't know that she'd
had a long-running affair

00:59:33.390 --> 00:59:35.620
with an extremely
rich woman who,

00:59:35.620 --> 00:59:38.300
whose mother was the founder
of the Museum of Modern Art

00:59:38.300 --> 00:59:41.190
that she's had an
affair with one

00:59:41.190 --> 00:59:43.690
of America's leading
women poets.

00:59:43.690 --> 00:59:46.610
She had an affair
with Orson Welles.

00:59:46.610 --> 00:59:48.410
With Tallulah Bankhead.

00:59:48.410 --> 00:59:53.150
Great actress and so I really
got interested in the fact

00:59:53.150 --> 00:59:56.390
that she was moving in a much
different level of society

00:59:56.390 --> 00:59:58.390
than anything else
had ever told us.

00:59:58.390 --> 01:00:02.090
Now one, one reviewer
said I was dropping names.

01:00:02.090 --> 01:00:03.650
Yes, I was dropping names.

01:00:03.650 --> 01:00:06.390
But I was trying to
rebalance the names

01:00:06.390 --> 01:00:07.690
that were already there.

01:00:07.690 --> 01:00:15.550
You know, narcs and drug
agents or various sorts.

01:00:15.550 --> 01:00:19.450
But now I had two
books going at once.

01:00:19.450 --> 01:00:21.400
So I decided well,
I'll do them both

01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:22.750
at once and see how it goes.

01:00:22.750 --> 01:00:28.720
Had to cut back part of it.

01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:32.200
I think, I think I got across
what I wanted to which was

01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:36.430
that it's a bad mistake to view
a singer through their songs

01:00:36.430 --> 01:00:37.800
and try to read their life.

01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:40.970
To read their discography as
a biography, pretty simple.

01:00:40.970 --> 01:00:44.110
That there's an acting
phenomena going on here.

01:00:44.110 --> 01:00:45.600
You're acting these parts.

01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:48.490
You're, you're playing
a part and to think

01:00:48.490 --> 01:00:51.580
that the singer is always sad
or always happy or whatever.

01:00:51.580 --> 01:00:53.840
That usually they're
sad is a bad mistake.

01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:56.260
And I realized that
that's why reviews

01:00:56.260 --> 01:00:57.860
of things are constantly
quoting lyrics

01:00:57.860 --> 01:00:59.420
as if they were the person.

01:00:59.420 --> 01:01:01.310
Is she talking about that?

01:01:01.310 --> 01:01:04.510
I mean, is that, you know?

01:01:04.510 --> 01:01:07.410
That's, that's pretty
shabby work, I think.

01:01:07.410 --> 01:01:09.780
And I wanted to show that
her life was more interesting

01:01:09.780 --> 01:01:11.080
than it appeared.

01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:13.560
And that she was much
smarter than she appeared

01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:15.800
because had been treated as
if she were kind of dopey

01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:18.090
and drifting through life.

01:01:18.090 --> 01:01:21.040
And that I could curse myself.

01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:22.380
I didn't say this clearly.

01:01:22.380 --> 01:01:23.680
But I wanted to say that her,

01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:26.130
her autobiography
is an indictment

01:01:26.130 --> 01:01:28.940
of virtually every
American institution.

01:01:28.940 --> 01:01:32.380
From child hood and school
right through to death.

01:01:32.380 --> 01:01:35.390
Because each one of
these things fails her.

01:01:35.390 --> 01:01:38.340
I should have said that more
strongly and I, I just slipped,

01:01:38.340 --> 01:01:42.540
lack of courage or
whatever, I didn't say it.

01:01:42.540 --> 01:01:45.070
By and large, I think
I pulled it off.

01:01:45.070 --> 01:01:50.610
The Washington Post reviewer
thought it was terrible.

01:01:50.610 --> 01:01:54.760
Which is to say I didn't
represent the Billie Holiday-- .

01:01:54.760 --> 01:01:56.060
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum:
That's what I mean

01:01:56.060 --> 01:01:58.230
about people clinging
to their myths.

01:01:58.230 --> 01:02:01.490
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: But I mean what,
even at her worst, I mean,

01:02:01.490 --> 01:02:04.110
we're talking now physical
worst, mental worst.

01:02:04.110 --> 01:02:06.830
She was doing things that
granted were the voice

01:02:06.830 --> 01:02:09.370
that most people
don't find great.

01:02:09.370 --> 01:02:14.340
She was doing things that great
singers wouldn't dare to do.

01:02:14.340 --> 01:02:16.000
I'll just mention a couple.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.040
What singer do you
know would take a song

01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:19.660
like Back in Your Own Backyard.

01:02:19.660 --> 01:02:21.410
I think that's it.

01:02:21.410 --> 01:02:25.780
It's a 1920s Al Gol-- Al
Jolson, you know, dead song.

01:02:25.780 --> 01:02:28.550
She sings the song with,
with the same, on the same A,

01:02:28.550 --> 01:02:33.200
I think it's A. Same
note 27 times.

01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:34.840
Blah, blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah.

01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:39.130
[Inaudible] And even
Gunther Schuller,

01:02:39.130 --> 01:02:42.640
great musicologist said
she pushed too hard

01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:43.940
on this, you know.

01:02:43.940 --> 01:02:45.550
Well, what does she do next?

01:02:45.550 --> 01:02:47.690
The next note, the
point where she was

01:02:47.690 --> 01:02:49.690
in this song is the
highest not of the song.

01:02:49.690 --> 01:02:51.830
She sang it as the lowest note.

01:02:51.830 --> 01:02:55.620
Then when she reaches a point
where the lowest note should be,

01:02:55.620 --> 01:02:57.480
she sang the highest note.

01:02:57.480 --> 01:03:01.450
So those 27 repeated
notes puts you in tension.

01:03:01.450 --> 01:03:03.130
Like what?

01:03:03.130 --> 01:03:05.320
And then suddenly, it's
going all over the place.

01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:09.700
And they're exercises
in vocal artistry.

01:03:09.700 --> 01:03:12.380
Always rhythmic and so on.

01:03:12.380 --> 01:03:13.680
Or-- .

01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:14.980
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: By the way,
do you think that's something?

01:03:14.980 --> 01:03:17.680
Those choices she made?

01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:19.290
Were those in the moment?

01:03:19.290 --> 01:03:20.590
Or is-- ?

01:03:20.590 --> 01:03:21.890
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: Oh, absolutely.

01:03:21.890 --> 01:03:23.190
Her stuff is different.

01:03:23.190 --> 01:03:24.490
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum:

01:03:24.490 --> 01:03:25.790
An alternative tape would
show a very different/

01:03:25.790 --> 01:03:27.570
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: Yeah, I mean
the tricky thing you're talking

01:03:27.570 --> 01:03:28.870
about with her is
she does something

01:03:28.870 --> 01:03:30.740
that nobody else has done.

01:03:30.740 --> 01:03:32.510
And I don't even know
how you'd learn to do it.

01:03:32.510 --> 01:03:34.580
She never sings on the beat.

01:03:34.580 --> 01:03:37.050
Now most people hear
it as off the beat.

01:03:37.050 --> 01:03:40.960
And you'll find right now
[inaudible] wrote the other day.

01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:42.330
She always was behind the beat.

01:03:42.330 --> 01:03:44.990
Well, if you're always behind
the beat, when the band ends,

01:03:44.990 --> 01:03:46.290
you'd still be singing.

01:03:46.290 --> 01:03:47.590
So that can't be right.

01:03:47.590 --> 01:03:49.230
She's going behind the beat,
then in front of the beat.

01:03:49.230 --> 01:03:50.530
And bouncing back and forth.

01:03:50.530 --> 01:03:52.230
And that was the trick.

01:03:52.230 --> 01:03:54.900
And I had some students
who charted

01:03:54.900 --> 01:03:58.580
out both how her voice
worked in terms of the band.

01:03:58.580 --> 01:04:00.700
And their beat and
the beat of the music.

01:04:00.700 --> 01:04:02.510
And she's never on
either one of them.

01:04:02.510 --> 01:04:06.200
Now here's a singer who
was not taught to do this.

01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:08.210
I don't know how you teach it.

01:04:08.210 --> 01:04:13.330
But naturally had a feel for
rhythm that said don't do that.

01:04:13.330 --> 01:04:16.000
And if I you know if you were
to take a young singer now

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.050
and say here's how
you can be a success.

01:04:18.050 --> 01:04:20.220
Don't ever sing on the beat.

01:04:20.220 --> 01:04:23.610
And then by the way throw
in, and by the way pick

01:04:23.610 --> 01:04:26.300
as your favorite songs
one about lynching.

01:04:26.300 --> 01:04:28.220
One about being a poor child.

01:04:28.220 --> 01:04:31.080
And the other about being a-- .

01:04:31.080 --> 01:04:33.910
What's the third one?

01:04:33.910 --> 01:04:35.210
Can't remember it.

01:04:35.210 --> 01:04:37.170
These are all bad
career choices.

01:04:37.170 --> 01:04:38.470
She should have been terrible.

01:04:38.470 --> 01:04:39.770
She should have been awful.

01:04:39.770 --> 01:04:41.090
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: But
nobody follows.

01:04:41.090 --> 01:04:44.780
I mean, the point is she
didn't have those rules.

01:04:44.780 --> 01:04:48.440
She was constantly breaking
rules in creative ways.

01:04:48.440 --> 01:04:51.140
And this I think is what
has always bothered me

01:04:51.140 --> 01:04:52.440
about the myth.

01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:56.590
Is that it takes you away from
the brilliance of what she did.

01:04:56.590 --> 01:05:00.180
And instead dwells
on her suffering.

01:05:00.180 --> 01:05:02.490
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: I was pleased
that I, I, I dared to say

01:05:02.490 --> 01:05:06.720
that some of her
technique Bob Dylan uses.

01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:08.020
And I'll stick with that.

01:05:08.020 --> 01:05:09.410
Bob Dylan knows that-- .

01:05:09.410 --> 01:05:12.000
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: On the
most recording he made?

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:13.800
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: No, no, no.

01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:17.060
Always. And damned if
he hasn't said as much.

01:05:17.060 --> 01:05:19.190
He said, "Billie
Holiday and I were,

01:05:19.190 --> 01:05:22.800
were had the same
kind of problems.

01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:24.440
People [inaudible]
we had bad voices.

01:05:24.440 --> 01:05:26.270
And they said we were behind
the beat," and so forth.

01:05:26.270 --> 01:05:27.910
But he knew it.

01:05:27.910 --> 01:05:29.490
I had, I had, I had
a couple things

01:05:29.490 --> 01:05:32.790
down that, rather famous ones.

01:05:32.790 --> 01:05:34.090
I hesitate to mention now.

01:05:34.090 --> 01:05:35.390
If I get it wrong.

01:05:35.390 --> 01:05:38.980
But it was one of the early
rock things that he, he's back

01:05:38.980 --> 01:05:40.280
and forth on the beat.

01:05:40.280 --> 01:05:42.230
I, I always noticed that.

01:05:42.230 --> 01:05:45.690
And I, I don't think he's
doing it on the new things.

01:05:45.690 --> 01:05:49.270
Maybe out of a kind of
discretion about it.

01:05:49.270 --> 01:05:51.940
He's at a funny place
on that stuff.

01:05:51.940 --> 01:05:53.950
But Dylan's very
conscious of where he set.

01:05:53.950 --> 01:05:56.460
And then he said, "Don't' forget

01:05:56.460 --> 01:05:58.980
that Jon Hammonds signed
me, and so did she."

01:05:58.980 --> 01:06:03.640
And then I looked to
Hammond, and Hammond said,

01:06:03.640 --> 01:06:07.960
"You think I took a lot of
grief for signing Dylan,

01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:11.100
nothing to what I got when
I signed Billie Holiday."

01:06:11.100 --> 01:06:13.160
They said, "This
is not a singer."

01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:16.140
And that's what they
said about Dylan.

01:06:16.140 --> 01:06:19.050
So I thought I was
on safe ground then.

01:06:19.050 --> 01:06:21.250
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: When
you found first of all,

01:06:21.250 --> 01:06:24.730
how did you find the draft
of her autobiography?

01:06:24.730 --> 01:06:26.240
Was it at the published?

01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:29.550
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: No, it was in
an archive of Robert O'Meely,

01:06:29.550 --> 01:06:31.420
a Professor of English
at Columbia.

01:06:31.420 --> 01:06:32.760
And-- .

01:06:32.760 --> 01:06:34.150
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: In
his personal collection?

01:06:34.150 --> 01:06:36.200
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: Yeah,
and it was onion skin,

01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:37.500
the way they used to keep them.

01:06:37.500 --> 01:06:40.030
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: How did
he find it, do you know?

01:06:40.030 --> 01:06:41.730
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: I've learned
not to ask those questions.

01:06:41.730 --> 01:06:43.030
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: Okay.

01:06:43.030 --> 01:06:45.440
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: I don't, I
don't want to sound strange.

01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:50.550
It's just do I need
to know that?

01:06:50.550 --> 01:06:54.960
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: I'm curious
about where-- about provenance.

01:06:54.960 --> 01:06:56.510
Anyway.

01:06:56.510 --> 01:07:00.070
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: I wasn't
criminal, I'm sure.

01:07:00.070 --> 01:07:02.950
It's like finding
the, the first attempt

01:07:02.950 --> 01:07:06.390
at a Billie Holiday biography by
a woman who killed herself here

01:07:06.390 --> 01:07:08.550
in D.C. at a prominent hotel.

01:07:08.550 --> 01:07:11.140
No one had bothered to
take it out of the library.

01:07:11.140 --> 01:07:13.020
It was just sitting there.

01:07:13.020 --> 01:07:14.320
No one thought to take it out.

01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:15.810
They didn't look at it.

01:07:15.810 --> 01:07:19.960
And I looked at it and said,
you know, 600, 800 pages here.

01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:22.680
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: So the
changes between the draft

01:07:22.680 --> 01:07:25.020
and what finally gets published.

01:07:25.020 --> 01:07:28.570
How much of that is a
professional editor who's

01:07:28.570 --> 01:07:30.180
striking things out.

01:07:30.180 --> 01:07:32.690
And how much of it was Billie
saying, "No, I don't want

01:07:32.690 --> 01:07:33.990
to tell these stories"?

01:07:33.990 --> 01:07:35.880
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: Well, first of
all, she had as a co-author,

01:07:35.880 --> 01:07:40.450
who was himself a prize-winning
journalist who had done none

01:07:40.450 --> 01:07:42.250
of the reviewers then.

01:07:42.250 --> 01:07:47.100
It came out in '56, or now,
bother to look him up to find

01:07:47.100 --> 01:07:55.880
out that he had, he had written
the first, the first long series

01:07:55.880 --> 01:07:57.550
of ar-- well, the first.

01:07:57.550 --> 01:08:01.640
First series, but the long
series too of drug addiction

01:08:01.640 --> 01:08:03.470
in New York in the early '50s.

01:08:03.470 --> 01:08:06.730
He wrote a prize-winning piece
on Puerto Ricans in New York

01:08:06.730 --> 01:08:09.570
and their problems with
housing and jobs and so forth.

01:08:09.570 --> 01:08:13.950
Back when they were more,
more of a new phenomenon.

01:08:13.950 --> 01:08:15.830
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum:
Is this William Duffy?

01:08:15.830 --> 01:08:18.850
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: Yeah, and he had
also been a political speech

01:08:18.850 --> 01:08:23.330
writer for I forget
who it is now.

01:08:23.330 --> 01:08:26.470
He had, he had been a writer

01:08:26.470 --> 01:08:29.510
for a labor magazines,
for union magazines.

01:08:29.510 --> 01:08:34.410
He had this big career, and
he was the, the top writer

01:08:34.410 --> 01:08:39.370
of the New York Post
at the time.

01:08:39.370 --> 01:08:40.670
They treated him as a hack.

01:08:40.670 --> 01:08:44.580
And they always say he
was a hack tabloid writer.

01:08:44.580 --> 01:08:47.570
Well, I mean tabloid is
a shape of a newspapers.

01:08:47.570 --> 01:08:49.610
That's a cheap thing to say.

01:08:49.610 --> 01:08:50.910
This guy had good credentials.

01:08:50.910 --> 01:08:52.210
He had, and he knew the music.

01:08:52.210 --> 01:08:53.510
He played piano.

01:08:53.510 --> 01:08:55.980
And he's done some
gigging and stuff.

01:08:55.980 --> 01:08:58.080
And then I found his letters.

01:08:58.080 --> 01:09:00.060
Through a partner of his.

01:09:00.060 --> 01:09:06.970
And I found that he had taken
on her critics at least,

01:09:06.970 --> 01:09:10.200
if not written about
them publicly,

01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:13.230
in a rather severe and,
and interesting way.

01:09:13.230 --> 01:09:17.050
For example, when-- .

01:09:17.050 --> 01:09:19.860
When Strange Fruit
appeared and this was seen

01:09:19.860 --> 01:09:22.150
to be a song about lynching.

01:09:22.150 --> 01:09:23.990
That set off all kinds of bells.

01:09:23.990 --> 01:09:27.120
So southerns didn't
want to hear the song.

01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:28.690
If you were objecting to it.

01:09:28.690 --> 01:09:31.750
And people were saying
that the FBI contacted her.

01:09:31.750 --> 01:09:33.980
Wanted to know if the
Communist Party had urged her

01:09:33.980 --> 01:09:35.280
to write the song.

01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:38.680
It turns out it was written by
a member of the Communist Party.

01:09:38.680 --> 01:09:41.090
That-- they hadn't looked
that up yet I guess.

01:09:41.090 --> 01:09:43.400
[Inaudible] Yeah, who's
who adopted the Rosenberg,

01:09:43.400 --> 01:09:46.650
the Rosenberg children after
the parents were killed.

01:09:46.650 --> 01:09:47.950
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: Oh,
I didn't' know that.

01:09:47.950 --> 01:09:49.720
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: But the FBI
hadn't looked that up yet.

01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:53.540
So they were coming
from the wrong end.

01:09:53.540 --> 01:09:57.800
So I'm trying to think who
he wrote this letter to.

01:09:57.800 --> 01:10:00.580
This is her, her co-writer.

01:10:00.580 --> 01:10:07.760
He said, he said the FBI
and, and critics have said

01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:14.790
that this poor, ignorant black
girl, barefooted in their mind,

01:10:14.790 --> 01:10:16.360
isn't able to think for herself.

01:10:16.360 --> 01:10:18.650
In fact, several writers said

01:10:18.650 --> 01:10:21.020
that she didn't know
anything about lynching.

01:10:21.020 --> 01:10:23.520
When it was a common
phenomena at the time.

01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:25.130
Everyone knew about it.

01:10:25.130 --> 01:10:28.340
And said [inaudible] was this
ignorant, illiterate person.

01:10:28.340 --> 01:10:33.260
When in fact, she knew every
word of that personally.

01:10:33.260 --> 01:10:35.310
She knew the consequences
of it and so on.

01:10:35.310 --> 01:10:38.410
And said she could have easily
have sung faux spirituals

01:10:38.410 --> 01:10:41.050
like Marian Anderson,
you know, in Washington.

01:10:41.050 --> 01:10:44.850
A famous incident in the
[inaudible] or somewhere.

01:10:44.850 --> 01:10:48.170
And passed herself off
as a good Christian girl

01:10:48.170 --> 01:10:51.170
who was you know knew her place.

01:10:51.170 --> 01:10:52.790
And said she wouldn't
touch songs

01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:54.090
with fake singing like that.

01:10:54.090 --> 01:10:56.730
Everything she sang was
from personal feelings.

01:10:56.730 --> 01:11:01.230
She was a-- I'm slaughtering the
emotion which she put to this.

01:11:01.230 --> 01:11:06.420
But he was pointing out
this huge, you know, almost,

01:11:06.420 --> 01:11:09.770
almost conspiracy between
journalists and institutions

01:11:09.770 --> 01:11:15.140
of justice to present,
to nullify the song.

01:11:15.140 --> 01:11:18.850
To treat it as a not
important document.

01:11:18.850 --> 01:11:25.240
And a song about
lynching as a pop song?

01:11:25.240 --> 01:11:28.860
Whoa? Then or now,
you know, is stunning.

01:11:28.860 --> 01:11:32.500
And to perform it in nightclubs
with people with drinks

01:11:32.500 --> 01:11:36.590
in their hand and goof food
was not only outrageous,

01:11:36.590 --> 01:11:38.550
but it required a whole staging.

01:11:38.550 --> 01:11:42.140
Which meant the lights
had to go out.

01:11:42.140 --> 01:11:43.880
You had to shift
the whole atmosphere

01:11:43.880 --> 01:11:46.820
or the whole place would
be in chaos, right?

01:11:46.820 --> 01:11:49.570
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: Little
pin spotlight on her?

01:11:49.570 --> 01:11:51.790
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: Yeah.

01:11:51.790 --> 01:11:54.890
Well, I mean, I hated the idea

01:11:54.890 --> 01:11:57.900
that she was just
called a jazz singer.

01:11:57.900 --> 01:12:00.690
Because the early jazz people
didn't call her a jazz singer.

01:12:00.690 --> 01:12:04.060
So now she's, she's
being called it

01:12:04.060 --> 01:12:05.860
when jazz is not in its heyday.

01:12:05.860 --> 01:12:08.540
When it was in its heyday,
she wasn't a jazz singer.

01:12:08.540 --> 01:12:09.840
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: So
there was a response

01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:12.120
to the book at the time.

01:12:12.120 --> 01:12:15.940
Whether it was from her
peers or whether it was

01:12:15.940 --> 01:12:17.240
from the general public.

01:12:17.240 --> 01:12:21.580
And then it's maybe
two generations later

01:12:21.580 --> 01:12:26.230
that people experience
it again with the film

01:12:26.230 --> 01:12:29.450
that was made starring Diana
Ross based on the book.

01:12:29.450 --> 01:12:33.650
Do you have any thoughts
about that film?

01:12:33.650 --> 01:12:36.670
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: Well, I
mean, she was a good singer.

01:12:36.670 --> 01:12:38.550
As good of singing as she did.

01:12:38.550 --> 01:12:40.720
But it wasn't Billie
Holiday's singing.

01:12:40.720 --> 01:12:42.940
But beyond that, and
this is something

01:12:42.940 --> 01:12:46.080
that Diana Ross herself
questioned.

01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:49.920
That the, the biography was
being scuttled here entirely

01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:51.490
to create a new figure.

01:12:51.490 --> 01:12:55.530
And Barry what's his name.

01:12:55.530 --> 01:12:56.830
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: Gordy.

01:12:56.830 --> 01:12:58.900
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: Gordy, yeah
said his famous remark was,

01:12:58.900 --> 01:13:00.830
"White people change the
biographies all the time

01:13:00.830 --> 01:13:02.130
in the movies.

01:13:02.130 --> 01:13:03.430
Why can't we?"

01:13:03.430 --> 01:13:04.730
Well, it's hard to
argue with that

01:13:04.730 --> 01:13:07.130
because it's what does happen.

01:13:07.130 --> 01:13:10.100
They turned it into
a fifties melodrama.

01:13:10.100 --> 01:13:12.570
With a, with a housewife
becoming crazy it opens with.

01:13:12.570 --> 01:13:18.620
You know, and a straightjacket,
screaming on the floor.

01:13:18.620 --> 01:13:20.740
Billie Holiday didn't scream.

01:13:20.740 --> 01:13:22.790
[Inaudible] I mean, come on.

01:13:22.790 --> 01:13:27.240
But then they introduce this
sympathetic male character who's

01:13:27.240 --> 01:13:30.210
more like a father
than her lover.

01:13:30.210 --> 01:13:31.510
Who's going to make
things right.

01:13:31.510 --> 01:13:33.860
I found it disgusting, but hey.

01:13:33.860 --> 01:13:35.810
It won some prizes.

01:13:35.810 --> 01:13:37.110
It did well.

01:13:37.110 --> 01:13:38.410
I mean, you know.

01:13:38.410 --> 01:13:40.980
I said the same thing
about Jelly's Last Jam

01:13:40.980 --> 01:13:42.280
which I thought was an atrocity.

01:13:42.280 --> 01:13:44.900
It won six Tonys.

01:13:44.900 --> 01:13:47.300
Using swing arrangements
instead of--

01:13:47.300 --> 01:13:49.930
and not his tunes
because he had trouble

01:13:49.930 --> 01:13:52.910
with [inaudible] the author
of the book they were using.

01:13:52.910 --> 01:14:01.040
So I had trouble with [laughter]
all those films that attempt

01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:05.960
to do history of black music
as if it were done yesterday.

01:14:05.960 --> 01:14:07.260
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: Well,

01:14:07.260 --> 01:14:10.000
they're not documentary
films, these feature films.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:15.630
Are there, do you think there
are any well done feature films

01:14:15.630 --> 01:14:17.800
about this music?

01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:19.110
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: That's
a tough one.

01:14:19.110 --> 01:14:23.740
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: I mean,
did you like Round Midnight?

01:14:23.740 --> 01:14:29.550
Young Man with a Horn?

01:14:29.550 --> 01:14:30.880
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: I
liked things about it.

01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:32.550
I didn't think it
was because of that.

01:14:32.550 --> 01:14:35.200
I mean, I thought Young Man
with a Horn was a nice picture

01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:36.500
of New York at that time

01:14:36.500 --> 01:14:39.410
and some other things,
daring writing and.

01:14:39.410 --> 01:14:42.040
I thought-- what was
your other example?

01:14:42.040 --> 01:14:43.340
Round Midnight?

01:14:43.340 --> 01:14:44.640
I thought I had some
nice stuff in it.

01:14:44.640 --> 01:14:46.650
I thought some of the
music was ill-chosen

01:14:46.650 --> 01:14:49.630
for the acting was brilliant.

01:14:49.630 --> 01:14:54.340
I found out that Dexter Gordon
had been re-writing his part

01:14:54.340 --> 01:14:55.640
every day.

01:14:55.640 --> 01:14:56.940
And I talked to the
director about it at length.

01:14:56.940 --> 01:14:58.240
He said he'd come in and
say, "I can't say this."

01:14:58.240 --> 01:15:00.600
And so you know, I was
really impressed with that.

01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:04.810
But I found the film a downer
in the wrong sense of the word.

01:15:04.810 --> 01:15:06.140
Has there ever been a good one?

01:15:06.140 --> 01:15:10.500
I'm about to say no.

01:15:10.500 --> 01:15:13.130
But hold on.

01:15:13.130 --> 01:15:17.120
There's a funny way in
which the Chet Baker story,

01:15:17.120 --> 01:15:19.090
which nobody's seen, I guess.

01:15:19.090 --> 01:15:20.410
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum:
Oh, the recent film?

01:15:20.410 --> 01:15:23.780
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: The funny way
in which I found it interesting

01:15:23.780 --> 01:15:26.710
in spite of all its flaws.

01:15:26.710 --> 01:15:30.000
I think because it was so
understated and on the edge

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:33.250
of boring that they
really had his character.

01:15:33.250 --> 01:15:36.610
Whereas the Miles film was
going over the top to turn it

01:15:36.610 --> 01:15:39.480
into a Buddy film, action film

01:15:39.480 --> 01:15:42.620
in which Miles' character
gets lost entirely.

01:15:42.620 --> 01:15:45.240
To that degree, the one
film is much better made.

01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:49.260
The other film is, is
cheaply made by necessity

01:15:49.260 --> 01:15:50.870
but stayed closer
to the character.

01:15:50.870 --> 01:15:53.010
Not that it was great.

01:15:53.010 --> 01:15:56.230
Let's see, there must
be something here.

01:15:56.230 --> 01:16:02.880
Well what's that film with
Louis Armstrong playing a-- .

01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:04.180
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum:
A Man Called Adam,

01:16:04.180 --> 01:16:07.680
yeah with Sammy Davis Junior.

01:16:07.680 --> 01:16:09.930
And Frank Sinatra Junior.

01:16:09.930 --> 01:16:11.320
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: Too
Late Blues maybe.

01:16:11.320 --> 01:16:12.620
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: Oh, yeah.

01:16:12.620 --> 01:16:16.410
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: But
nobody sees those films.

01:16:16.410 --> 01:16:18.840
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: Yeah, well
they're worth seeking out.

01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:20.140
I mean, it's like the music.

01:16:20.140 --> 01:16:24.070
You, you have to know what
to look for or to listen for.

01:16:24.070 --> 01:16:28.290
And the people who are truly
interested will seek them out.

01:16:28.290 --> 01:16:29.750
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: There
were also those TV films

01:16:29.750 --> 01:16:32.320
like Johnny Staccato.

01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:33.860
Nobody knows that.

01:16:33.860 --> 01:16:37.070
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: That's
another [inaudible] isn't it?

01:16:37.070 --> 01:16:40.500
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: Yes, which
was Second City used

01:16:40.500 --> 01:16:42.280
to mercilessly parody.

01:16:42.280 --> 01:16:46.660
This is a, you know
kind of small jazz bar

01:16:46.660 --> 01:16:48.760
from the neighborhood.

01:16:48.760 --> 01:16:50.510
Private detective
comes in and plays.

01:16:50.510 --> 01:16:51.810
Sits in with the band.

01:16:51.810 --> 01:16:53.110
Good musicians if I recall.

01:16:53.110 --> 01:16:54.560
Really serious musicians
playing.

01:16:54.560 --> 01:16:55.860
He'd sit in on piano.

01:16:55.860 --> 01:16:58.620
And it's-- a crime would
occur, and he'd go solve it.

01:16:58.620 --> 01:17:00.440
And Second City which,
I guess they're--

01:17:00.440 --> 01:17:02.770
turned into Saturday
Night Live later.

01:17:02.770 --> 01:17:04.150
They have him saying,
"Well I've got

01:17:04.150 --> 01:17:05.870
to finish the set
before I go outside."

01:17:05.870 --> 01:17:07.820
So people are getting their
throat cut, beaten up.

01:17:07.820 --> 01:17:09.120
He'd go out there,
he's always too late.

01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:11.480
But there was also
a nother Peter Gunn.

01:17:11.480 --> 01:17:17.900
Peter Gunn had a kind
of laconic, you know,

01:17:17.900 --> 01:17:20.300
whatever kind of quality to it.

01:17:20.300 --> 01:17:22.730
People are being beaten
up, the music is going on.

01:17:22.730 --> 01:17:24.670
Yeah, well, finish
the drink and.

01:17:24.670 --> 01:17:25.970
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum:
Pretty good music in that.

01:17:25.970 --> 01:17:27.270
Henry Mancini.

01:17:27.270 --> 01:17:30.790
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: It was, it
was-- who was the director?

01:17:30.790 --> 01:17:32.540
A big time director leader.

01:17:32.540 --> 01:17:35.180
But they had the idea that
something-- [inaudible].

01:17:36.430 --> 01:17:41.370
He thought you can make
a bar a world, you know.

01:17:41.370 --> 01:17:42.670
What happens in a bar.

01:17:42.670 --> 01:17:43.970
The first time I had
ever been in a bar.

01:17:43.970 --> 01:17:47.090
I think I was 15 at a place
called Billie [inaudible] I had

01:17:47.090 --> 01:17:48.390
that feeling.

01:17:48.390 --> 01:17:49.690
It was, it was a little place

01:17:49.690 --> 01:17:51.520
that had been a prohibition
place in Philadelphia

01:17:51.520 --> 01:17:53.160
in a back alley,
dead end street.

01:17:53.160 --> 01:17:54.460
It was perfect.

01:17:54.460 --> 01:17:56.480
It was filmed a lot.

01:17:56.480 --> 01:17:59.820
And Billie [inaudible] was
a clarinet player and he'd,

01:17:59.820 --> 01:18:03.260
between sets would tell you
about Al Capone or whatever.

01:18:03.260 --> 01:18:06.150
And how he stiffed,
Al Capone stiffed him.

01:18:06.150 --> 01:18:08.950
And the musicians are
crowded in a corner.

01:18:08.950 --> 01:18:10.980
And as young as I
was, I mean, I could,

01:18:10.980 --> 01:18:12.290
I thought I could live in there.

01:18:12.290 --> 01:18:13.830
In fact, I remember
it very clearly.

01:18:13.830 --> 01:18:16.980
First, I walked in the door, and
I saw something so impressive.

01:18:16.980 --> 01:18:18.670
I've never forgotten it.

01:18:18.670 --> 01:18:21.900
The bartender who I thought was
old, but he probably was 40.

01:18:21.900 --> 01:18:23.910
Saw two men about
to hit each other.

01:18:23.910 --> 01:18:25.550
They were shoving.

01:18:25.550 --> 01:18:28.350
He leaped over the bar,
just sprung over, you know,

01:18:28.350 --> 01:18:31.890
which is an act of
real strength anyway.

01:18:31.890 --> 01:18:34.210
Landed right beside them,
put his around them and said,

01:18:34.210 --> 01:18:35.730
"Gentlemen, gentlemen.

01:18:35.730 --> 01:18:37.750
Surely we can solve
this in civilized ways.

01:18:37.750 --> 01:18:39.060
We're all gentlemen here.

01:18:39.060 --> 01:18:40.360
I'll buy a drink
for both of you.

01:18:40.360 --> 01:18:41.820
Please sit down, not
next to each other.

01:18:41.820 --> 01:18:43.260
But please sit down, son."

01:18:43.260 --> 01:18:45.960
He sits them down,
and he walked away,

01:18:45.960 --> 01:18:48.060
I saw he had a sawed
off poll cue stuck

01:18:48.060 --> 01:18:49.600
in the back of his pants.

01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:53.090
And I thought you know, this
is [laughter] I could stay

01:18:53.090 --> 01:18:54.390
in this bar.

01:18:54.390 --> 01:18:55.690
And then I heard
[inaudible] by you know,

01:18:55.690 --> 01:19:00.890
a song that is as
sad as it comes.

01:19:00.890 --> 01:19:03.900
You know about what
it's like in those bars.

01:19:03.900 --> 01:19:05.440
What your life is like.

01:19:05.440 --> 01:19:08.460
By the way, did you
see Lady Gaga sang

01:19:08.460 --> 01:19:10.260
that at the a couple, couple-- .

01:19:10.260 --> 01:19:15.270
[Inaudible] I don't know
if people know this,

01:19:15.270 --> 01:19:19.750
but it's a song about
failed love, alcoholism.

01:19:19.750 --> 01:19:21.050
It's drinking your life away.

01:19:21.050 --> 01:19:22.920
Living with people
who are drunks.

01:19:22.920 --> 01:19:24.220
Sad.

01:19:24.220 --> 01:19:25.520
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum:
There's also a film.

01:19:25.520 --> 01:19:27.420
Do you know this film?

01:19:27.420 --> 01:19:30.650
Yeah, it's Forest
Whitaker and Jeff Goldblum

01:19:30.650 --> 01:19:33.620
about two jazz musicians
in New York.

01:19:33.620 --> 01:19:35.300
Talk about obscure films.

01:19:35.300 --> 01:19:36.600
Feature films.

01:19:36.600 --> 01:19:37.900
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: Girls who
had all [inaudible] faces.

01:19:37.900 --> 01:19:39.710
Distant [inaudible] traces.

01:19:39.710 --> 01:19:41.010
That was it.

01:19:41.010 --> 01:19:42.780
Sad and distant gray traces.

01:19:42.780 --> 01:19:46.050
Well I mean.

01:19:46.050 --> 01:19:49.140
What was I thinking
of with that?

01:19:49.140 --> 01:19:54.640
Oh, yeah, when it was sung by
Lady Gaga at the Academy Awards,

01:19:54.640 --> 01:19:56.640
the ending goes down the scale.

01:19:56.640 --> 01:20:00.680
And there I'll live while I rot

01:20:00.680 --> 01:20:03.770
with those whose
lives are lonely too.

01:20:03.770 --> 01:20:05.070
She takes it up.

01:20:05.070 --> 01:20:06.370
It's triumphant.

01:20:06.370 --> 01:20:11.130
And I thought, how can
you see this as a triumph?

01:20:11.130 --> 01:20:12.430
Perverse.

01:20:12.430 --> 01:20:13.730
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: Yeah.

01:20:13.730 --> 01:20:16.930
We've been talking a lot
about your past glories.

01:20:16.930 --> 01:20:18.290
I want you to catch us up.

01:20:18.290 --> 01:20:21.450
And let's talk about
what you're doing now.

01:20:21.450 --> 01:20:23.730
What's this book
you're working on?

01:20:23.730 --> 01:20:26.430
And why don't you
talk a little bit

01:20:26.430 --> 01:20:29.070
about what you'll be
researching while you're here

01:20:29.070 --> 01:20:31.170
at the Library this week?

01:20:31.170 --> 01:20:33.210
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: Maybe I
can make this same answer

01:20:33.210 --> 01:20:34.510
to one, maybe not.

01:20:34.510 --> 01:20:37.610
Well, I'm doing a
book on Harry Smith.

01:20:37.610 --> 01:20:39.670
And my experience has
been when I say that,

01:20:39.670 --> 01:20:42.330
the two responses,
one is Harry who?

01:20:42.330 --> 01:20:44.440
And those who know him,
say, "This is a mistake.

01:20:44.440 --> 01:20:45.970
Don't do it."

01:20:45.970 --> 01:20:47.890
And that was generally
the publisher's view.

01:20:47.890 --> 01:20:50.520
The cool people would say,
"Oh, I know this [inaudible].

01:20:50.520 --> 01:20:51.820
Take it to the seniors."

01:20:51.820 --> 01:20:53.120
Who'd say no, no, no.

01:20:53.120 --> 01:20:54.850
This is not a book.

01:20:54.850 --> 01:20:56.150
Harry Smith is known

01:20:56.150 --> 01:21:02.620
for introducing a very
influential six-LP set back

01:21:02.620 --> 01:21:06.020
in '52 that changed the
nature of folk music

01:21:06.020 --> 01:21:07.320
in America ever since.

01:21:07.320 --> 01:21:10.600
Dylan recorded I think 14 or 15
of the songs from that album.

01:21:10.600 --> 01:21:13.960
They were, they were songs
that had been around,

01:21:13.960 --> 01:21:15.390
had actually been recorded 20--

01:21:15.390 --> 01:21:18.780
, 25 years before but somehow
seemed like they were from Mars.

01:21:18.780 --> 01:21:22.070
They were so different,
sound was different.

01:21:22.070 --> 01:21:23.370
The quality of voices.

01:21:23.370 --> 01:21:26.610
And it sort of gave
license to a new kind

01:21:26.610 --> 01:21:28.170
of singer, Dylan, for example.

01:21:28.170 --> 01:21:30.410
They didn't have to
sing like other people.

01:21:30.410 --> 01:21:32.400
So he's known for that.

01:21:32.400 --> 01:21:34.490
And the daring of doing this.

01:21:34.490 --> 01:21:36.770
Even though it wasn't an
original thing [inaudible] Lomax

01:21:36.770 --> 01:21:38.110
had done it before him.

01:21:38.110 --> 01:21:40.380
But before that, he'd been
an experimental filmmaker

01:21:40.380 --> 01:21:44.670
in Southern California and
made a number of animated films

01:21:44.670 --> 01:21:49.190
which were famous for
either being hand-painted.

01:21:49.190 --> 01:21:51.830
Which is nightmarish where you
have to repeat the same frame

01:21:51.830 --> 01:21:54.890
and try to get it close
enough to the previous frames.

01:21:54.890 --> 01:21:57.260
And then he put interesting
scores to it

01:21:57.260 --> 01:22:01.310
like the [inaudible] or Dizzy
Gillespie or, or Zulu dancers,

01:22:01.310 --> 01:22:02.610
or something or other.

01:22:02.610 --> 01:22:06.020
Or he used cut-outs
from odd sources.

01:22:06.020 --> 01:22:09.370
Muscle magazines,
Negro achievement.

01:22:09.370 --> 01:22:10.670
I don't know.

01:22:10.670 --> 01:22:13.460
He would create these
strange conglomerations

01:22:13.460 --> 01:22:16.660
of fantasied, animated figures.

01:22:16.660 --> 01:22:20.690
And it moved him-- and he
also did paintings of records,

01:22:20.690 --> 01:22:21.990
his recordings and songs.

01:22:21.990 --> 01:22:25.430
Where he tried to get a visual
representation of the sound,

01:22:25.430 --> 01:22:27.930
not the, the words of it.

01:22:27.930 --> 01:22:32.160
He had 15, had had national
acclaim as a student

01:22:32.160 --> 01:22:35.090
of Northwest Coast,
Native Americans.

01:22:35.090 --> 01:22:39.270
And had already done archeology
and gotten things in museums.

01:22:39.270 --> 01:22:42.800
He had salvaged some
totem poles from wreckage.

01:22:42.800 --> 01:22:44.990
He had recorded songs and tales.

01:22:44.990 --> 01:22:46.790
He was writing-- I'm talking

01:22:46.790 --> 01:22:50.890
at 15 years old he writing
grammars, making word lists

01:22:50.890 --> 01:22:54.350
of several different
Native American groups.

01:22:54.350 --> 01:22:55.650
And so on.

01:22:55.650 --> 01:22:57.100
He was, he was invited
to be part of

01:22:57.100 --> 01:23:00.320
and may have been inducted
into secret societies

01:23:00.320 --> 01:23:02.690
when white adults
couldn't go in.

01:23:02.690 --> 01:23:03.990
That would be enough
right there.

01:23:03.990 --> 01:23:08.690
But in 1951, he attracted
the interest, the attention

01:23:08.690 --> 01:23:14.080
of Hilla von Rebay who
was the basic founder

01:23:14.080 --> 01:23:16.580
of the Guggenheim Museum.

01:23:16.580 --> 01:23:20.770
It was then called the
Museum of Non-Objective Art.

01:23:20.770 --> 01:23:24.210
So he came to New York on
an early Guggenheim grant.

01:23:24.210 --> 01:23:28.860
But Harry was also a
junkie and was living

01:23:28.860 --> 01:23:30.700
without any means at all.

01:23:30.700 --> 01:23:36.130
He had lived part of the time
over a black bar in Filmore,

01:23:36.130 --> 01:23:37.870
an all-black neighborhood then.

01:23:37.870 --> 01:23:40.070
And he survived getting
free meals

01:23:40.070 --> 01:23:42.940
for painting murals
and the like.

01:23:42.940 --> 01:23:47.370
He moved, he came to New
York, he said, to meet,

01:23:47.370 --> 01:23:50.610
to [inaudible] and monk.

01:23:50.610 --> 01:23:53.250
I'm still trying to figure out
how those two things work out.

01:23:53.250 --> 01:23:54.550
I'm thinking.

01:23:54.550 --> 01:23:57.130
He moved down to East Village.

01:23:57.130 --> 01:23:58.850
And off and on for
the rest of his life,

01:23:58.850 --> 01:24:00.450
he lived with no income at all.

01:24:00.450 --> 01:24:02.490
The money would come
into his hands.

01:24:02.490 --> 01:24:04.150
Apparently never
more than say six

01:24:04.150 --> 01:24:06.240
to ten thousand dollars a year.

01:24:06.240 --> 01:24:08.780
But it was always spent
on some project or other.

01:24:08.780 --> 01:24:13.780
And he was sick or drunk or
out of it for much of his life.

01:24:13.780 --> 01:24:18.090
But what's interesting
to me is that he drew

01:24:18.090 --> 01:24:21.610
around him this enormous
crowd of people.

01:24:21.610 --> 01:24:23.760
See if I can rattle some off.

01:24:23.760 --> 01:24:25.690
He was once back
for one of his films

01:24:25.690 --> 01:24:28.590
which was an animated
version of the Wizard of Oz.

01:24:28.590 --> 01:24:31.420
He was backed by
Elizabeth Taylor in the eras

01:24:31.420 --> 01:24:36.840
of Avon Products, the era
of A&amp;P, Huntington Hartford.

01:24:36.840 --> 01:24:38.280
What was the year?

01:24:38.280 --> 01:24:40.130
Big-money people.

01:24:40.130 --> 01:24:44.220
Alan Ginsberg underwrote
him for a while.

01:24:44.220 --> 01:24:47.780
Had him living there.

01:24:47.780 --> 01:24:49.490
The co-inventor of
the helicopter,

01:24:49.490 --> 01:24:52.890
Arthur M Young financed
him for a while.

01:24:52.890 --> 01:24:55.580
Tennessee Williams
always spoke well of him.

01:24:55.580 --> 01:25:00.050
Arthur C Clark asked him
to advise him on 2001.

01:25:00.050 --> 01:25:03.080
Lives in the Chelsea free.

01:25:03.080 --> 01:25:04.650
It goes on and on.

01:25:04.650 --> 01:25:10.410
But the problem here is
there's no coherent life there.

01:25:13.870 --> 01:25:16.420
There's a puzzle-- that's
why I did it, frankly.

01:25:16.420 --> 01:25:17.780
This is unwritable.

01:25:17.780 --> 01:25:20.160
I thought can I do this?

01:25:20.160 --> 01:25:23.550
I mean, no one's going to do it.

01:25:23.550 --> 01:25:26.310
Can you make something
out of this?

01:25:26.310 --> 01:25:28.290
He wound up-- let's see.

01:25:28.290 --> 01:25:31.240
He went out to Naropa Institute.

01:25:31.240 --> 01:25:33.570
They lived in a little
shack on campus.

01:25:33.570 --> 01:25:37.520
Where he would give these
lectures, high on various drugs.

01:25:37.520 --> 01:25:40.550
By the way, this guy was so
serious about drugs and art

01:25:40.550 --> 01:25:43.960
that he would list in
the notes for his films.

01:25:43.960 --> 01:25:47.350
What drugs he was on and at what
point in the film he was using

01:25:47.350 --> 01:25:48.650
so he could weigh
them against them.

01:25:48.650 --> 01:25:51.000
So he would go to
classes talking

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:54.870
about American Indian stuff, and
he's be very high and cutting in

01:25:54.870 --> 01:25:57.240
and out of the lecture.

01:25:57.240 --> 01:25:59.500
[Inaudible] Alice Longworth's
Roosevelt's books, right?

01:25:59.500 --> 01:26:00.800
You should have, you know.

01:26:00.800 --> 01:26:02.850
You never really know
what was happening there.

01:26:02.850 --> 01:26:06.210
So the challenge, I thought
was first of all, his,

01:26:06.210 --> 01:26:11.720
his books are all in a warehouse
over in Red Hook in New York

01:26:11.720 --> 01:26:15.520
because Getty, who has all of
his artworks didn't want them.

01:26:15.520 --> 01:26:17.240
And they fill, they
would fill a New York

01:26:17.240 --> 01:26:19.000
apartment floor-to-ceiling.

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.930
So I said, "I'll
read these books."

01:26:21.930 --> 01:26:24.410
It's now become clear
to me, I'm not going

01:26:24.410 --> 01:26:26.380
to be able to read those books.

01:26:26.380 --> 01:26:27.680
But he did.

01:26:27.680 --> 01:26:28.980
He spent all his money
reading this stuff.

01:26:28.980 --> 01:26:31.780
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: Did he
make any notes in the books?

01:26:31.780 --> 01:26:34.700
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: Yeah, but they're
usually notes to connect things,

01:26:34.700 --> 01:26:36.610
like song types, you know.

01:26:36.610 --> 01:26:38.570
I mean, he was, he
was into folk song.

01:26:38.570 --> 01:26:42.350
He collected, at one point
he was seriously trying

01:26:42.350 --> 01:26:46.520
to get every known version
of Shine into the Titanic,

01:26:46.520 --> 01:26:51.880
either the song or
the, or the folktale

01:26:51.880 --> 01:26:54.650
of [inaudible] the old
Appalachian-type things.

01:26:54.650 --> 01:26:56.180
So really different
kind of material.

01:26:56.180 --> 01:26:59.470
One is a comic piece about
the guy who doesn't die

01:26:59.470 --> 01:27:01.220
on the Titanic, but
he jumps overboard.

01:27:01.220 --> 01:27:02.870
No one believes that
it's sinking.

01:27:02.870 --> 01:27:05.990
And the one about a
woman who rejects her men

01:27:05.990 --> 01:27:09.180
by becomes the coldest
known figure and--

01:27:09.180 --> 01:27:11.300
he hates her and so forth.

01:27:11.300 --> 01:27:12.780
He's trying to do
that kind of stuff.

01:27:12.780 --> 01:27:16.040
And he was collecting
peyote materials,

01:27:16.040 --> 01:27:20.710
both eating them
and studying them.

01:27:20.710 --> 01:27:22.900
He, he managed to get samples

01:27:22.900 --> 01:27:26.570
of every Seminole
women's dress maker.

01:27:26.570 --> 01:27:28.300
Which there were 20 some,

01:27:28.300 --> 01:27:30.040
patchwork dresses,
very elaborate.

01:27:30.040 --> 01:27:31.340
Smithsonian's got them.

01:27:31.340 --> 01:27:33.500
In fact, Smithsonian
has films of this stuff.

01:27:33.500 --> 01:27:36.560
And his stuff is in the
Louvre, the Smithsonian.

01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:37.860
Not here though.

01:27:37.860 --> 01:27:39.160
I doubt it.

01:27:39.160 --> 01:27:40.500
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: We
have yet to look.

01:27:40.500 --> 01:27:44.510
So you're saying
that this is a book

01:27:44.510 --> 01:27:46.220
that might well be unwritable.

01:27:46.220 --> 01:27:49.360
So how do you write a
book that's unwritable?

01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:52.550
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: I don't know.

01:27:52.550 --> 01:27:55.040
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: You're
still in the research phase or?

01:27:55.040 --> 01:27:57.440
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: Well, I'd
better get out of it first.

01:27:57.440 --> 01:28:01.580
Because [inaudible] going to
do a big thing on him in 2019.

01:28:01.580 --> 01:28:06.080
If I don't have it done by them,
it'll become a period piece.

01:28:06.080 --> 01:28:07.380
I don't know.

01:28:07.380 --> 01:28:10.110
There is, there is, is a model
but I couldn't follow it.

01:28:10.110 --> 01:28:12.460
The guy, the guy, an English guy

01:28:12.460 --> 01:28:15.260
who found a bum who
he befriended.

01:28:15.260 --> 01:28:19.510
And he offered to write the
bum's life story which he did.

01:28:19.510 --> 01:28:22.680
And then he would give
the chapters to the guy.

01:28:22.680 --> 01:28:26.670
And the guy said, "This is
boring and dull and depressing.

01:28:26.670 --> 01:28:28.690
No one wants to know
about my life."

01:28:28.690 --> 01:28:33.590
And he was going to give the
guy the money from the book,

01:28:33.590 --> 01:28:36.630
and now he's depressed too.

01:28:36.630 --> 01:28:39.940
Now if you were writing the
book backwards where I turn

01:28:39.940 --> 01:28:43.300
out to be a nice middle class
kid with great prospects,

01:28:43.300 --> 01:28:44.650
it would make more sense.

01:28:44.650 --> 01:28:48.350
So as weird as this sounds,
he wrote the book backwards,

01:28:48.350 --> 01:28:52.400
and won a huge cash prize
and it sold very well.

01:28:52.400 --> 01:28:56.060
His second book, he discovered
that his landlord who lived

01:28:56.060 --> 01:28:58.340
in the basement was a
world-famous mathematician.

01:28:58.340 --> 01:29:01.650
Who have made some bad
mistake on one of his projects.

01:29:01.650 --> 01:29:03.810
Lost his job at Cambridge
University.

01:29:03.810 --> 01:29:07.690
And was living in the basement
on the rice and something else.

01:29:07.690 --> 01:29:10.670
And seemed to be half a lunatic.

01:29:10.670 --> 01:29:13.530
And he wrote a book
about this guy's life.

01:29:13.530 --> 01:29:14.830
And it's filled with drawings

01:29:14.830 --> 01:29:18.140
of advanced mathematics
and so forth.

01:29:18.140 --> 01:29:21.930
His third book, he
found a huge pile

01:29:21.930 --> 01:29:23.920
of manuscript in a dumpster.

01:29:23.920 --> 01:29:25.810
And he thought at first it
was by different people.

01:29:25.810 --> 01:29:28.190
It was 40,000 pages
of hand-written stuff.

01:29:28.190 --> 01:29:30.210
It was one woman's diary.

01:29:30.210 --> 01:29:33.440
So he decided he would
write a book on that diary.

01:29:33.440 --> 01:29:36.380
And found out she
was still alive.

01:29:36.380 --> 01:29:37.680
And off he goes.

01:29:37.680 --> 01:29:40.140
Now these are really
interesting books

01:29:40.140 --> 01:29:42.420
because they're critiques
of biography.

01:29:42.420 --> 01:29:43.820
They tell you there's
something wrong

01:29:43.820 --> 01:29:46.840
with biography [inaudible].

01:29:46.840 --> 01:29:49.410
And he incorporates
their criticisms.

01:29:49.410 --> 01:29:52.720
So both, all three of these
people said, "This is crap."

01:29:52.720 --> 01:29:55.830
And he would say,
"Why is it crap?"

01:29:55.830 --> 01:29:59.440
Didn't really incorporate
the-- well, I don't know.

01:29:59.440 --> 01:30:01.580
I don't think I can do that but.

01:30:01.580 --> 01:30:05.120
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: Something
tells me you like a challenge.

01:30:05.120 --> 01:30:06.420
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: Yeah, I guess.

01:30:06.420 --> 01:30:09.030
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: To
write the unwritable.

01:30:09.030 --> 01:30:11.900
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: Is there
anything unwritable?

01:30:11.900 --> 01:30:13.470
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum:
I don't know.

01:30:13.470 --> 01:30:17.720
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: Anything that's
notable should be writable,

01:30:17.720 --> 01:30:19.020
right?

01:30:19.020 --> 01:30:20.320
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: Yeah.

01:30:20.320 --> 01:30:21.960
Sounds, sounds about right.

01:30:21.960 --> 01:30:24.460
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: Look,
Sun Ra was unwritable.

01:30:25.810 --> 01:30:27.340
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: True.

01:30:27.340 --> 01:30:28.740
Well, I don't know.

01:30:28.740 --> 01:30:30.750
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: But I'm
very proud of that book.

01:30:30.750 --> 01:30:34.640
I'm very proud of that book
because I followed the logic

01:30:34.640 --> 01:30:35.950
of what he was reading.

01:30:35.950 --> 01:30:40.460
And that took him back into--
he read, who else read the books

01:30:40.460 --> 01:30:42.660
that Frankenstein's
monster read?

01:30:42.660 --> 01:30:44.920
That became his reading
list, right?

01:30:44.920 --> 01:30:46.890
And they're really
important books, by the way.

01:30:46.890 --> 01:30:48.190
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum:

01:30:48.190 --> 01:30:50.340
Did Frankenstein's monster
read Madame Blavatsky?

01:30:50.340 --> 01:30:53.130
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: No,
it was too soon.

01:30:53.130 --> 01:30:54.430
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: Oh, okay.

01:30:54.430 --> 01:30:58.830
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: But he, he
read more important book,

01:30:58.830 --> 01:31:05.750
Count Augustine Volney's
The Ruins of Empire which is

01:31:05.750 --> 01:31:08.470
like a sci-fi story
of being taken

01:31:08.470 --> 01:31:11.460
to see the ruins
of civilizations.

01:31:11.460 --> 01:31:12.760
And so forth.

01:31:12.760 --> 01:31:14.700
So that is the one where
Africa is the beginning

01:31:14.700 --> 01:31:17.080
of civilization, by the way.

01:31:17.080 --> 01:31:22.710
So I started reading these
things and wondering, was,

01:31:22.710 --> 01:31:24.730
was this character crazy
because he was talking

01:31:24.730 --> 01:31:27.360
about things that
sounded insane.

01:31:27.360 --> 01:31:29.360
Then I began to find that
they were written about

01:31:29.360 --> 01:31:32.290
and these were not--
you know for example.

01:31:32.290 --> 01:31:34.760
He was talking about at
one point white people

01:31:34.760 --> 01:31:38.100
who pass themselves
off as being Egyptians.

01:31:38.100 --> 01:31:40.860
And turning Egypt into a
European country rather

01:31:40.860 --> 01:31:43.900
than a, an African country.

01:31:43.900 --> 01:31:46.340
Which is quite true.

01:31:46.340 --> 01:31:47.640
So I started reading that,

01:31:47.640 --> 01:31:49.910
and I found out that the
English upper class at one point

01:31:49.910 --> 01:31:52.360
in the 19th century, there
was a movement among them

01:31:52.360 --> 01:31:55.870
to declare themselves as
the original Egyptians.

01:31:55.870 --> 01:31:58.410
And that to treat
Egyptians as fakes

01:31:58.410 --> 01:32:01.550
or as you know savages
of some sort.

01:32:01.550 --> 01:32:03.650
But before that had
been a group who thought

01:32:03.650 --> 01:32:06.350
of themself as the
original Jews.

01:32:06.350 --> 01:32:07.910
now I find it really fascinating

01:32:07.910 --> 01:32:09.550
that upper class
people had moved

01:32:09.550 --> 01:32:12.290
from being the original Jews
to being the original Egyptians

01:32:12.290 --> 01:32:14.480
because in which case they
would to have had to-- .

01:32:14.480 --> 01:32:17.810
Ina way I guess they did
drive their ancestors

01:32:17.810 --> 01:32:19.730
out of Egypt in the process.

01:32:19.730 --> 01:32:21.760
But I thought this
was really strange.

01:32:21.760 --> 01:32:28.360
And then they were called,
it was the Identity movement.

01:32:28.360 --> 01:32:32.160
Does that ring any bells?

01:32:32.160 --> 01:32:35.650
It's [inaudible] on
the news right now.

01:32:35.650 --> 01:32:38.420
[inaudible] has some
identity articles.

01:32:38.420 --> 01:32:45.440
The Christina Identity movement
included what is his name?

01:32:45.440 --> 01:32:49.080
Timothy McVeigh and the
guy, Rudolph something?

01:32:49.080 --> 01:32:51.130
The Atlanta bomber?

01:32:51.130 --> 01:32:52.680
They were both Christian
Identity people.

01:32:52.680 --> 01:32:57.220
Well, these people are the
heirs of that previous group

01:32:57.220 --> 01:32:59.090
who think they're the
original something or other.

01:32:59.090 --> 01:33:01.090
So I'm pretty proud of this.

01:33:01.090 --> 01:33:03.260
You know I can just see
Sun Ra is reading this.

01:33:03.260 --> 01:33:04.940
He's reading what he's reading.

01:33:04.940 --> 01:33:07.420
He's saying, "Look at
these crazy white people.

01:33:07.420 --> 01:33:08.870
They're turning themselves
[laughter].

01:33:08.870 --> 01:33:12.500
They're turning themselves into
Jews, Egyptians, and ballers."

01:33:12.500 --> 01:33:13.800
[Laughter]

01:33:13.800 --> 01:33:20.260
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: It's clear
that you know quite a bit

01:33:20.260 --> 01:33:22.050
about a lot of things.

01:33:22.050 --> 01:33:25.350
And that shows up
in your writing.

01:33:25.350 --> 01:33:27.440
But let me ask this
last question for now.

01:33:27.440 --> 01:33:29.740
And, and we'll take
note of the fact

01:33:29.740 --> 01:33:32.240
that this is just the first
part of our interview.

01:33:32.240 --> 01:33:34.540
You're going to be back
in the fall for part two

01:33:34.540 --> 01:33:37.050
of your residency here.

01:33:37.050 --> 01:33:41.480
So let me end this
part by asking

01:33:41.480 --> 01:33:45.940
since you know quite a bit and
you've used, you draw from a lot

01:33:45.940 --> 01:33:50.700
in your writing, in your books.

01:33:50.700 --> 01:33:57.210
Are you able to just listen
to music without context?

01:33:57.210 --> 01:33:58.750
Just for the joy of it?

01:33:58.750 --> 01:34:00.050
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: Yeah, always.

01:34:00.050 --> 01:34:03.480
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: And give
me some examples of what kind

01:34:03.480 --> 01:34:06.870
of music just brings you
joy, without any backstory.

01:34:06.870 --> 01:34:08.170
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: Well,

01:34:08.170 --> 01:34:09.590
what context would there
be for Sun Ra music?

01:34:09.590 --> 01:34:11.060
I mean-- ?

01:34:11.060 --> 01:34:13.240
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: Well, you
know a lot about Sun Ra now.

01:34:13.240 --> 01:34:15.270
You know how it all
fits together.

01:34:15.270 --> 01:34:17.250
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: I don't-- .

01:34:17.250 --> 01:34:19.580
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: But
okay, let's take Sun Ra.

01:34:19.580 --> 01:34:21.280
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: But
it's an anti-style.

01:34:21.280 --> 01:34:22.580
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: Okay,

01:34:22.580 --> 01:34:25.110
so what is it you
like about Sun Ra?

01:34:25.110 --> 01:34:27.120
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: Well, I mean, I
like the fact that I was born

01:34:27.120 --> 01:34:28.760
in the same town as he was

01:34:28.760 --> 01:34:30.080
and was living there
at the same time.

01:34:30.080 --> 01:34:32.480
And was then found out I was
living only a few blocks away

01:34:32.480 --> 01:34:34.570
from him many years later.

01:34:34.570 --> 01:34:39.440
And I thought this is like you
know synchronicity at its best.

01:34:39.440 --> 01:34:44.340
And I can, I used to run
into him in various places.

01:34:44.340 --> 01:34:48.570
And every time I did, there
was something weirder coming

01:34:48.570 --> 01:34:49.870
out of it.

01:34:49.870 --> 01:34:51.170
I mean, imagine a guy getting

01:34:51.170 --> 01:34:55.230
out of a stretch limo wearing
a gold lame robe and a kind

01:34:55.230 --> 01:35:00.250
of space hat, eating a hoagie.

01:35:00.250 --> 01:35:05.320
Or going to see him
at Swarthmore College.

01:35:05.320 --> 01:35:07.070
A place that was
really an out school

01:35:07.070 --> 01:35:12.270
where students really thought
they were the Avant-something.

01:35:12.270 --> 01:35:14.140
And they freaked out
when they saw this stuff.

01:35:14.140 --> 01:35:15.440
There was just too
much for them.

01:35:15.440 --> 01:35:16.740
They ran out.

01:35:16.740 --> 01:35:18.280
But what happened
there was out the,

01:35:18.280 --> 01:35:20.130
they were selling
records outside.

01:35:20.130 --> 01:35:22.410
And they were all blank
with a name on them.

01:35:22.410 --> 01:35:24.440
But you couldn't
tell what they were.

01:35:24.440 --> 01:35:26.310
And I said to the
guy selling them,

01:35:26.310 --> 01:35:27.610
"What kind of music is this?"

01:35:27.610 --> 01:35:29.860
He said, "Well, this
is outer space music,

01:35:29.860 --> 01:35:32.830
and this is cocktail music."

01:35:32.830 --> 01:35:34.370
I said, "Alright, I'll
take one of each."

01:35:34.370 --> 01:35:35.670
I come home, it's true.

01:35:35.670 --> 01:35:36.970
One was like Tea for Two.

01:35:36.970 --> 01:35:38.270
And so and so.

01:35:38.270 --> 01:35:39.640
And this was synthesizers going,

01:35:39.640 --> 01:35:42.010
flying through the
roof and what have you.

01:35:42.010 --> 01:35:45.870
I don't, I don't see a
context for this except

01:35:45.870 --> 01:35:48.390
that it's the context
of no context.

01:35:48.390 --> 01:35:52.210
It's I mean I made, I made
a context in the book.

01:35:52.210 --> 01:35:53.690
But it's, it's, it's crazy.

01:35:53.690 --> 01:35:58.100
It leaps across Southern
Baptist belief in this and that.

01:35:58.100 --> 01:36:02.740
Southern California
athletic Christianity.

01:36:04.120 --> 01:36:07.540
Space abduction myths.

01:36:07.540 --> 01:36:12.400
You know I, I just pulled
out all the stops for it.

01:36:12.400 --> 01:36:14.070
But I never think of
the music that way.

01:36:14.070 --> 01:36:18.690
I mean, I, I, I -- let me see.

01:36:18.690 --> 01:36:21.370
Do I ever think of context?

01:36:21.370 --> 01:36:22.670
Country music, yeah.

01:36:22.670 --> 01:36:25.950
Maybe. But not -- jazz?

01:36:25.950 --> 01:36:28.470
Look, it, to me it's
like abstract painting.

01:36:28.470 --> 01:36:30.410
You know, if you're going
to go look for something,

01:36:30.410 --> 01:36:32.860
you could say, "Oh,
that's really a river."

01:36:32.860 --> 01:36:34.700
Or isn't that, you know,

01:36:34.700 --> 01:36:36.710
isn't there a person standing
behind that or something?

01:36:36.710 --> 01:36:38.820
But that's not what
it was intended to be.

01:36:38.820 --> 01:36:44.620
And it's supposed
to be about well,

01:36:44.620 --> 01:36:47.250
if I understand abstract
expressionism.

01:36:47.250 --> 01:36:49.580
It's supposed to be about
feeling and improvisations.

01:36:49.580 --> 01:36:53.720
Supposed to be free expression
of feelings and emotions.

01:36:53.720 --> 01:36:58.500
Maybe even spiritual and
surrealistic in some ways.

01:36:58.500 --> 01:37:00.390
And so I hear the
music that was too.

01:37:00.390 --> 01:37:02.050
It's operating at another level.

01:37:02.050 --> 01:37:05.710
And it, I do understand
why drugs work with music.

01:37:05.710 --> 01:37:10.020
I mean, I do understand
you know.

01:37:10.020 --> 01:37:12.700
Before it damages
you, it does take you

01:37:12.700 --> 01:37:15.910
to someplace that's like that.

01:37:15.910 --> 01:37:19.440
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: I can
say for myself I love walking

01:37:19.440 --> 01:37:23.180
through an art gallery
or museum.

01:37:23.180 --> 01:37:25.310
But there's nothing like
walking through this museum

01:37:25.310 --> 01:37:29.530
than with an artist who has
a different way to see things

01:37:29.530 --> 01:37:31.160
that I might not notice.

01:37:31.160 --> 01:37:32.460
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: That's true.

01:37:32.460 --> 01:37:34.570
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: And this
is why I love to sit down

01:37:34.570 --> 01:37:36.620
and talk to you about music.

01:37:36.620 --> 01:37:37.960
Because you notice some things

01:37:37.960 --> 01:37:40.970
that I might not
otherwise notice.

01:37:40.970 --> 01:37:42.850
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: But
[inaudible] your context.

01:37:42.850 --> 01:37:44.150
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: Well, okay.

01:37:44.150 --> 01:37:45.760
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: Maybe you're
fine tuning or something?

01:37:45.760 --> 01:37:48.270
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum:
Yeah, just as a-- .

01:37:48.270 --> 01:37:50.890
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: This is
what happens if you walk

01:37:50.890 --> 01:37:54.060
through a museum
with the wrong person

01:37:54.060 --> 01:37:56.030
because with [inaudible]
Broadway Boogie Woogie.

01:37:56.030 --> 01:37:57.820
Well, we know something
about this guy.

01:37:57.820 --> 01:38:00.630
They've recreated his
studio from pictures.

01:38:00.630 --> 01:38:02.870
And there were piles of
Boogie-woogie records.

01:38:02.870 --> 01:38:04.170
And he was playing
them all the time.

01:38:04.170 --> 01:38:06.010
He was dancing while
he was painting.

01:38:06.010 --> 01:38:09.710
And he intended this to sound,
look like those things sounded

01:38:09.710 --> 01:38:12.510
like which is, you
know, colors moving

01:38:12.510 --> 01:38:15.580
in cross patterns and so forth.

01:38:15.580 --> 01:38:16.880
End of story.

01:38:16.880 --> 01:38:18.180
I mean, that's it.

01:38:18.180 --> 01:38:19.480
He wrote essays on this.

01:38:19.480 --> 01:38:21.390
He talked about the
disappearance of perspective.

01:38:21.390 --> 01:38:22.690
Flattening out.

01:38:22.690 --> 01:38:25.180
We're working on a simple plane.

01:38:25.180 --> 01:38:27.610
Color is not interacting
with color.

01:38:27.610 --> 01:38:29.150
Volume is moving
in different ways.

01:38:29.150 --> 01:38:30.450
All written out.

01:38:30.450 --> 01:38:32.930
So I go to the Museum of
Modern Art to see the show.

01:38:32.930 --> 01:38:35.230
They've got the records
piled up there,

01:38:35.230 --> 01:38:38.770
and who's the commentator
but Marcellus.

01:38:38.770 --> 01:38:40.830
And when Marcellus
looks, this is over,

01:38:40.830 --> 01:38:44.010
you know, through earbuds.

01:38:44.010 --> 01:38:47.200
It's looking at Broadway
Boogie Woogie and he says,

01:38:47.200 --> 01:38:48.830
"You see the black
line around it?"

01:38:48.830 --> 01:38:50.320
Which is the frame.

01:38:50.320 --> 01:38:52.140
He says, "That's
the powerful force

01:38:52.140 --> 01:38:54.560
of Louis Armstrong's trumpet."

01:38:54.560 --> 01:38:57.320
Now it turns out that
Mondrian didn't give a damn

01:38:57.320 --> 01:38:59.610
about Louis Armstrong.

01:38:59.610 --> 01:39:01.270
But you know?

01:39:01.270 --> 01:39:02.760
[Laughter]

01:39:02.760 --> 01:39:04.060
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: Nice story!

01:39:04.060 --> 01:39:06.840
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: I think he
said Boogie-woogie is not

01:39:06.840 --> 01:39:08.140
in the [inaudible].

01:39:08.140 --> 01:39:09.760
I mean, it's too close
to rock and roll, right?

01:39:09.760 --> 01:39:12.110
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum:
Lot of nice stories.

01:39:12.110 --> 01:39:16.800
We're going to continue this
next time, and I'm going

01:39:18.830 --> 01:39:23.260
to look forward to it.

01:39:23.260 --> 01:39:24.560
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: Thank you.
