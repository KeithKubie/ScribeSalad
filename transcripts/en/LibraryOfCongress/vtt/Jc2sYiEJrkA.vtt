&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: We're ready,
we're ready and I'm so glad

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:09.630
to be here on the purple stage,
I even wore my purple top.

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:15.380
Because this is one of
the best times to be here.

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:19.110
Because I am Carla Hayden,
I'm the Librarian of Congress.

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:21.510
And I started out.

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.340
[ Applause ]

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.050
One of the joys of being the
Librarian of Congress though is

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.790
that you get to be with authors
and people that you have admired

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.530
and have written books
and done so many things.

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:38.580
And this person that
I'm sitting here

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.690
with is the person
we're all here to see,

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.510
Mrs. Jacqueline Woodson.

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.240
[ Applause ]

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:51.900
Talk about a superstar books,
she is it and I'm just going

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.460
to read, I know you
know all of this

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.760
but I think it just
bears repeating.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.050
That she is the 2014
National Book Award winner

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.490
for her New York Times
best selling memoir Brown

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:07.510
Girl Dreaming.

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.390
[ Applause ]

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.770
Which was also a recipient of
the Coretta Scott King Award,

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.730
A Newbery Honor, the NAACP
Image Award and a Sibert Honor,

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:23.750
all like the Olympics.

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.570
The Olympics of Young
Peoples Books in 2015,

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.270
she was named the Young
People's Poet Laureate

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.630
by the Poetry Foundation,
her recent book for adults,

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.800
Another Brooklyn was a
national book award finalist,

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.690
she has two dozen
award winning books,

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.910
she's a four time Newbery
Honor, this is like champion it,

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:49.440
but that's why she has a medal

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.250
because just recently she was
named The National Ambassador

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.030
for Young People's Literature
for the Library of Congress.

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.040
[ Applause ]

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.940
So she is an Olympic winner.

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.770
And so there are more awards
and I know you, you know all

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.270
about that but what is
really wonderful is the fact

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:18.440
that you have a new book that
I shared a few minutes ago

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.490
with Justice Sonia Sotomayor.

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:22.830
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline Woodson:
That's so great.

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.670
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Who said
that when she was growing

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.590
up she didn't have books

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.490
that reflected her
heritage Puerto Rican.

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:30.790
What about you?

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.210
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline Woodson:
I think the same thing,

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:35.770
I grew up in 70's in South
Carolina and Brooklyn

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.390
and there were very few
books that I could open up

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.240
and see someone who looked
like me, who had a family

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.030
that reflected my family.

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.790
And we talk a lot about what
Dr. Rudine Sims Bishop talks

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.500
about in terms of people
needing mirrors and windows

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.060
and sliding glass
doors in their books.

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.090
Mirror book is a book where you
see a part of yourself in it

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.090
and there weren't a lot of
mirror books in my childhood.

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.370
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: And I had that
and this was a long time ago.

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.910
A little book Bright April
and it was a little brown girl

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.050
and I loved to see, I
thought that was me.

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:13.740
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline Woodson: Is
Bright April still in print?

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.080
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: It's
going to be reprinted

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.400
because I talk about it a lot.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.020
But that meant so much to me,
I said look there's my family

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.840
or look there's that and even

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.950
when it's complicated
it was good to see.

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.250
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline Woodson: So true.

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.130
I remember the books for me,
the first one ever was Zeely

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:36.510
by Virginia Hamilton, Stevie
by John Steptoe and Roll

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.820
of Thunder, Hear My
Cry by Mildred Taylor.

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.120
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Mildred Taylor.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.420
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline Woodson: Yeah.

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.340
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: And so
you've written I mentioned one

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.580
of the books for adults, but
you really have concentrated

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.140
on books for young people.

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.570
Why did you say, you know
that's where I want to stay?

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:53.870
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline Woodson:
I love young people.

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.010
I think y'all are going
to change the world,

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:57.940
I know you're already
changing the world.

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.740
I think young people
are the people

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:03.340
who are still having
conversations,

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.950
who are still thinking about
things and still figuring

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.470
out who they're becoming and
what they're going to do.

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:15.250
And I write to fill the gap that
was my childhood literature.

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:18.210
So, so growing up and
not having the books

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:21.010
that reflected my
experiences I know

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:22.680
for a long time there
were a lot of books

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.190
that didn't reflect a lot of
experiences and I really wanted

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:31.120
to put those experiences into
the world and legitimize them.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:36.120
But I just love, I remember
a teacher telling me

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.960
about Madelyn Engle
saying when you write,

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.100
write remembering
the child you were.

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.490
Because the essence of
childhood doesn't change,

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.050
you know the technology changes,

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.120
the fashion changes,
it changes back.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.160
But who we all are as
young people, what we want,

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.750
that sense of belonging, that
sense that they're other people

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.810
in the world like us that
says as Matt and Lauren talked

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:00.620
about love, feeling
loved, being loved, loving.

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:06.260
All of that is the thing all of
us at some point in our lives

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.210
or at all points
in our lives want.

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:11.720
And it's what I write about
and what I love writing about.

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:14.950
And so I mean I write
because I love writing.

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:17.440
But I also write because
I feel like I want

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.180
to have these conversations
through literature.

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.130
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: What about
writing about feeling different,

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:28.740
I know I was kind of nerdy
and all kinds of other stuff

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:32.050
and I always felt a little odd.

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.390
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline Woodson: Yeah,
yeah definitely, I mean I grew

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:37.190
up in a single family,
my mom was a single mom

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:39.170
and then my grandma
came to live with us.

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:44.500
But a lot of kids had moms
and dads and I'd go to school

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.310
and the teacher would be like
well ask your mom and dad

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:50.690
and I'd be like well that's not
me, she's not talking to me.

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:54.760
And those small ways in which
I felt different, invisible,

00:05:54.760 --> 00:06:00.480
unseen I really, I don't want
anyone to ever have to feel

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:03.380
that way, especially
young people.

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:05.270
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: And
books could help that.

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:06.750
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline Woodson:
Yeah definitely.

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:08.050
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: And
words and poetry,

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:09.350
now what about the poetry?

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:11.740
Because that's a
different way with words.

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:13.040
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline Woodson: Yes.

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:16.560
When I was growing up I
was very afraid of poetry.

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:20.510
I thought it was this
kind of secret language

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:23.720
that I wasn't meant
to understand.

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:26.250
And it wasn't until I
discovered Nikki Giovanni,

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:29.350
I remember my mom had an album
of Nikki Giovanni's poetry

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:32.790
and I was like what is that.

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:36.000
And it was kind of this ah ha
moment, then Langston Hughes,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.460
Gwendolyn Brooks and the poets
that really began to speak to me

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:41.440
because I understood
what they were saying.

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:46.010
And because of them I was
able to eventually understand,

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:49.120
you know Robert Frost, EE
Cummings and all the poets

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.390
that I later got introduced to.

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:54.430
But as a young person I was
just like, what is that,

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:56.710
why are the lines
breaking like that,

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:59.650
what is all this white space,
why didn't that sentence end

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:01.440
with a period, like
all the questions

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:03.910
of what is this thing
called poetry

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:05.330
and then I figured it out.

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:07.600
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: And it
started to flow from you?

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:08.900
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline Woodson: Yes, yes,

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:10.200
I mean it's our first
language right?

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:12.930
When babies are speaking
they speak

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:16.660
in these incomplete sentences
and then you fill it in.

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:21.700
But it's a musicality to
it, it's such a beauty

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:25.250
to those early words and
there's a lot of white space

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:28.480
around that, a lot of you
meeting the young person

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:30.950
and understanding them and
having the conversation

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:32.700
through their few words.

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:34.940
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Now there
were a lot of and I know this

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:38.890
because I've met a
few, aspiring writers,

00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:43.500
how many of you love
to write already?

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:46.410
Wow I knew that.

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:48.430
I knew that.

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:53.380
Poetry? Non-fiction?

00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:55.440
Fiction, stories?

00:07:55.440 --> 00:08:01.140
So you have aspiring writers
what do you advise them to do?

00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:02.440
They're already doing it.

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:03.740
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline Woodson: Yes.

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:07.150
The way to write, the way to
learn to write is by reading.

00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:11.540
I can't say that enough and you
don't have to read hard books,

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:15.370
I think reading picture books
teaches you a lot about writing.

00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:18.060
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Oh I
have to ask that one.

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:20.410
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline Woodson: Because
from the very first line you

00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:22.770
start getting a picture,
it's a very short story,

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:24.750
right when you think of
my book The Other Side,

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:26.320
that summer that
fence that stretched

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:28.770
through our town seemed bigger,
we lived in a yellow house

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:31.010
on one side of it, white
people lived on the other,

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:33.430
mamma said don't climb over
that fence when you play.

00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:34.730
She said it wasn't safe.

00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:36.510
So you get this whole
picture, you get the beginning

00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:39.140
of a story, you get
some of the middle of it

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:43.410
and boom it's very few words but
it's, it's giving you beginning,

00:08:43.410 --> 00:08:45.380
middle, end, it's
giving you character

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:48.550
and you didn't just have to
read 500 pages to learn that.

00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:51.040
So, so I say start
with the picture books

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:53.110
and really study them,
read the same books

00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:56.040
that you love again
and again and again.

00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:58.380
If you love, if you're
writing fantasy you have

00:08:58.380 --> 00:08:59.900
to be reading fantasy.

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:02.750
If you're writing poetry you
have to be reading poetry.

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:05.050
If you're writing
realistic fiction,

00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:06.910
you have to be reading
realistic fiction.

00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:10.790
And writing is a muscle, so
you have to use it every day

00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:15.240
or else it goes soft, right it
atrophies as we say, so write,

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:19.210
try to write something every
day and try to read everyday

00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:20.640
and read like the writer.

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:24.880
When I have a book called
American Negro Poetry Anthology

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:27.830
that I got from the
library when I was probably

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:30.850
about 12 years old and I
remember my mom taking me back

00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:33.460
to the library when she found
it years later and making me pay

00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:36.130
for it out of my allowance.

00:09:36.130 --> 00:09:37.430
Out of my allowance.

00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:38.730
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Okay.

00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:40.360
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline Woodson:
She was so mad.

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:43.500
And in the book there's
a Langston Hughes poem,

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:47.020
I Love My Friend, He
Went Away From Me.

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:50.290
The story ends same as it
begins, I love my friend.

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:51.590
And then right next to it

00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:54.160
in my little Jacqueline Woodson
handwriting I have I love my

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:55.540
friend, she's gone now,

00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:58.360
like I had copied his
poem and made it my own.

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:00.200
And that's how you
learn to start writing,

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:02.060
you learn from the writers
that came before you.

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:06.230
You copy their styles eventually
you find your own voice.

00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:10.670
So young writers now
is the time right?

00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:14.490
Share your writing
with people you trust.

00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:18.220
If you read something to someone
and they say I don't like it,

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:20.190
don't ever share
it with them again.

00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:21.490
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Really?

00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:22.790
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline Woodson:
Because that's not helpful, no,

00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:26.010
no that's destructive criticism,
that's not constructive.

00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:27.310
Constructive criticism.

00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:28.610
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: I like that.

00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:30.240
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline Woodson:
Yeah, it's someone,

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:32.720
when I share my writing with my
friends the first thing I say

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:36.930
to them is, just ask me, tell
me only what you love about it,

00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:39.510
that's all I want to hear, is
everything you love about it.

00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:41.070
And then they tell me
all these great things

00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:43.150
and that makes me want to
go back and write more.

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:46.140
And then the next time I
say ask me three questions.

00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:48.800
Why did Jeremiah end
up at that school,

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:52.710
you know why did [foreign
word] parents leave Colorado?

00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:58.430
Why did, you know why did
Clover's mother say she can't go

00:10:58.430 --> 00:10:59.880
to the other side of that fence?

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:01.840
Why did Mia's family move away?

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:06.980
And then those questions help me
fill out the story I'm writing.

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:09.300
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: That's
really liberating isn't it?

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:10.600
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline Woodson: Yes.

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:12.580
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: That if
someone is that negative

00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:14.990
when you first ask
them to help you.

00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:16.290
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline Woodson:
Yeah goodbye.

00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:17.590
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Let it go.

00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:18.890
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline Woodson:
Bye Felicia.

00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:20.190
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Bye Felicia.

00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:21.810
I like that.

00:11:21.810 --> 00:11:23.730
You can't help it.

00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:26.820
Well now, now you mentioned
earlier the other part

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:29.090
of the advice is
write something,

00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:31.160
write something everyday.

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:34.100
Now on my first reaction
is someone that doesn't

00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:36.780
like to exercise and
just like exercise,

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:39.400
well what if you don't
feel good that day or what

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:44.090
if you don't wanna write or
what if you're going on a trip?

00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:45.390
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline Woodson:
Then read because that's.

00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:46.690
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Oh okay.

00:11:46.690 --> 00:11:48.070
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline Woodson: If
you're reading very slowly,

00:11:48.070 --> 00:11:52.410
if you're really studying what
you're reading, you're reading

00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:55.270
like a writer, you're reading
as an engaged reader and this is

00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:58.370
for teachers who are saying
finish that book in a day,

00:11:58.370 --> 00:12:01.010
it takes writers a long
time to write those books,

00:12:01.010 --> 00:12:04.130
so let the students
read them slowly please.

00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:09.330
And read the same things
again and again like I said

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:10.890
because you're studying.

00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:15.730
When you get to the end of
a page and you're crying

00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:18.460
over something the author
wrote, go back and find

00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:22.180
out what words the author used
to get you to that feeling.

00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:24.330
The author didn't
say oh she was sad,

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:28.860
the author really showed you
how that persons sadness looked.

00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:31.870
And this really teaches
you how to, how to write,

00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:35.900
how to get to sadness, how to
have emotion in your characters.

00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:38.590
How to have tag lines,
he said, she said.

00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:42.360
You know when people talk
it's not like oh I went

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:45.070
to the store he said, like
their arms are moving,

00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:46.370
right they're doing stuff

00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:48.840
and studying literature
helps you do that.

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:50.880
And again you could
study picture books,

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:52.270
you could study middle
grade books,

00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:54.190
you can study adult books.

00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:56.320
But just read them again
and again and study them,

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:57.860
so if you're not writing and,

00:12:57.860 --> 00:13:01.900
because maybe you don't
have something to write with

00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:03.680
or you're in a car, read.

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:06.380
If reading in a car
makes you nauseous.

00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:07.680
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: That
happens to people.

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:08.980
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline Woodson: Yeah

00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:11.870
if it makes you nauseated
an audio book is another way

00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:13.980
of getting to story,
my son I was talking

00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:16.900
about my son who's a
huge Jason Reynolds fan.

00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:19.300
That boy always has
a book in his ear

00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:21.180
and he reads differently.

00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:24.490
And so audio books really
help him get to comprehension.

00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:28.610
So there's all kinds of
ways to get to books.

00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:32.400
Audio books I don't know if you
all know this, you can get them

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:35.040
on your phone from your library.

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:36.340
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Free.

00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:40.590
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline Woodson: Free
99, that's free in slang talk.

00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:41.890
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Oh.

00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:43.710
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline Woodson:
Free 99 is free.

00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:47.850
And you know use your libraries,
I'm not saying this just

00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:49.230
because I'm the ambassador who.

00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:50.530
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Or
she's sitting next to.

00:13:50.530 --> 00:13:52.860
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline Woodson: I'm
saying this because I grew

00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:54.830
up in a family that
didn't have a lot of money

00:13:54.830 --> 00:13:56.130
and we didn't have this,

00:13:56.130 --> 00:13:58.350
we didn't have book
festivals like this.

00:13:58.350 --> 00:14:01.530
And if we did we wouldn't have
been able to afford the books.

00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:03.680
So but we lived at our library

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:06.330
and my mother always made
sure our cards were current

00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:08.270
and she always made sure we went

00:14:08.270 --> 00:14:10.590
to the library and
took out books.

00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:13.390
And that was my access to books

00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:16.570
and by extension my access
to becoming a writer.

00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:18.400
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Is that
world that was open to ya.

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:19.700
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline Woodson: Uh hum.

00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:21.170
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Now you
mentioned reading picture books

00:14:21.170 --> 00:14:24.170
and sometimes older kids

00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:26.380
and young people say
oh picture book, no.

00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:27.810
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline Woodson: No, no.

00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:29.960
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden:
Read them, it's not.

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:31.610
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline Woodson: Yeah,
picture books are not just

00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:33.820
for little kids, picture
books are for anyone

00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:36.280
who wants a good story.

00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:39.060
If you feel like the pictures
are too babyish just read the

00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:42.510
words, read the words as a
poem, deconstruct the poem.

00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:46.020
And it's a good way for teachers
to teach about poetry and again

00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:52.080
to teach about the arc of
a narrative in 32 pages.

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:56.220
If you're, if you read
differently and words are hard

00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:57.520
to come by look at the pictures,

00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:00.460
in a good picture book you don't
even have to read the words

00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:03.740
to know the story because
the pictures tell the story.

00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:06.120
And so the pictures
should stand alone,

00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:10.040
I always with young
people I'll take a book

00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:12.290
that they haven't seen yet
and I'll show the pictures

00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:14.820
and ask them what do you think
the story is trying to say?

00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:16.120
What is it about?

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:18.290
And they'll have all
these brilliant answers

00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:20.550
without having read the
words because they know,

00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:23.380
they're learning how to
read through the pictures.

00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:26.400
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: You
mentioned reading differently.

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:28.180
Could you expand on
that a little bit

00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:30.370
because I think there's
more recognition now

00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:32.260
that there are many
ways to read?

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:33.560
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline Woodson: Yes.

00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:34.860
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: And
there no right ways.

00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:36.160
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline Woodson:
Yeah there is.

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:37.460
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: To
read different ways.

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:38.760
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline Woodson: Yeah.

00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:41.250
I'm trying to get rid of
terms like reluctant reader,

00:15:41.250 --> 00:15:45.020
struggling reader, people read
and they read differently.

00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:47.510
Some people read
books really quickly,

00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:49.350
some people read
books really slowly,

00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:51.370
I still read books
really slowly.

00:15:51.370 --> 00:15:54.690
I've always read books really
slowly as a result I have a lot

00:15:54.690 --> 00:15:57.970
of comprehension, but
if the class had been,

00:15:57.970 --> 00:16:01.370
the class would be finished the
book long before I was finished.

00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:04.100
Both my kids the same
thing, read very slowly.

00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:07.780
And reading slowly is not
the wrong way to read.

00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:13.420
Taking your time to figure
out words and decode language,

00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:15.470
it might take some
people longer than others

00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:18.610
but that doesn't mean
they're not as bright,

00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:20.600
it means they do
this differently.

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:25.420
I played basketball better
than, you know my sister.

00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:27.600
We, but that doesn't
make me a better person,

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:30.700
that makes her not,
that makes her,

00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:33.150
basketball not her sport,
it's my sport right?

00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:36.770
But my sister read really
really quickly and I think

00:16:36.770 --> 00:16:39.320
as a kid I was always like
well what's wrong with me,

00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:41.480
why and for those of you who
read Brown Girl Dreaming,

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:44.110
you know this, my sister
was always, you know get,

00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:46.740
they wanted to skip her, she was
always getting these accolades

00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:48.250
as an academic.

00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:52.470
And here I was coming along
and you know I'm reading not

00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:54.540
up to grade level quote unquote.

00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:57.900
I'm reading slowly,
I'm daydreaming

00:16:57.900 --> 00:17:01.650
and basically teachers was like
well what's wrong with that one.

00:17:01.650 --> 00:17:06.700
But what it is is once a
young persons brilliance gets

00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:10.210
recognized and every young
person has a brilliance,

00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:12.740
their passion is that brilliance

00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:15.880
and that brilliance is
their passion recognized.

00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:19.170
So for me my passion was
writing and I'm sure people are

00:17:19.170 --> 00:17:21.530
like well how is she going
to be a writer when she's

00:17:21.530 --> 00:17:26.960
such a slow reader and what they
missed was this is exactly how

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:28.410
you become a writer.

00:17:28.410 --> 00:17:29.710
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden:
Is reading slowly.

00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:34.990
Well I wanted to ask if
you could share this.

00:17:34.990 --> 00:17:41.360
I mentioned that Justice
Sotomayor wrote down the title

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:43.390
to the book and we're
going to send her a copy

00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:45.040
because when I explained to her.

00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:46.340
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline Woodson : I just
presented her with a copy.

00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:47.640
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden:
You presented her.

00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:48.940
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline Woodson: I did.

00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:51.260
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Yes because
she was so intrigued growing up,

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:54.770
being Puerto Rican and when
I told her about this book

00:17:54.770 --> 00:17:59.510
and the way it celebrates
when you begin

00:17:59.510 --> 00:18:02.570
to celebrate being different.

00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:06.950
It took me a lot longer and I
wish I had a book like this.

00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:08.250
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline Woodson:
Thank you,

00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:09.550
so I should read part of it?

00:18:09.550 --> 00:18:10.890
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: I
think you should.

00:18:10.890 --> 00:18:12.790
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline Woodson: Okay.

00:18:12.790 --> 00:18:16.130
&gt;&gt; Read all of it.

00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:19.370
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline Woodson: I don't
think we have time to read all

00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:21.460
of it but I can definitely read.

00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:23.810
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: The good parts.

00:18:23.810 --> 00:18:25.970
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline Woodson:
The day you began.

00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:28.600
There will be times when
you walk into a room

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:31.030
and no one there
is quite like you.

00:18:31.030 --> 00:18:34.830
Maybe it will be your
skin, your clothes

00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:36.880
or the curl of your hair.

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:41.640
There will be times when no one
understands the way words curl

00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:42.940
from your mouth.

00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:46.190
The beautiful language of
the country you left behind.

00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:47.680
My name is Ricaberto
[assumed spelling],

00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:49.180
we just moved her
from Venezuela.

00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:52.720
And because they don't
understand the class will fill

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:56.450
with laughter until the
teacher quiets everyone.

00:18:56.450 --> 00:19:00.630
Ricaberto from Venezuela,
your teacher says so softly

00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:03.370
and beautifully that your
name and homelands sound

00:19:03.370 --> 00:19:07.150
like flowers blooming, the
first bright notes of a song.

00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:10.790
There will be time when
the words don't come,

00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:14.030
your own voice once
huge now smaller

00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:16.660
when the teacher asks what
did you do last summer.

00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:18.830
Tell the class your story.

00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:21.690
We went to France Chalay
[assumed spelling] says.

00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:24.810
These shells came
from a beach in Maine.

00:19:24.810 --> 00:19:28.240
A boy named Jonathan holds out
a jar filled with tiny shells

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:31.130
so fragile they look
like they'll turn to dust

00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:33.860
in your own untraveled hands.

00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:36.360
My whole family went
to India, Spain,

00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:40.900
South Carolina each souvenir
a small triumph of a journey

00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:44.360
that travels going on and on.

00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:45.660
And as you stand at that,

00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:49.610
in front of that room you can
only remember how the heat waved

00:19:49.610 --> 00:19:51.420
as it lifted off the curb.

00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:54.750
And your days spent at home
caring for your little sister

00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:58.740
who made you laugh out loud and
hugged you hard at nap time.

00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:01.280
You can only remember the
books you kept on reading long

00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:03.050
after she had fallen to sleep.

00:20:03.050 --> 00:20:06.650
And in that room where no
one else is quite like you,

00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:09.060
you'll look down at
your own empty hands

00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:13.770
and wonder what good is this
when other students were flying

00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:17.280
and sailing and going somewhere.

00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:20.140
There will be times when
the lunch your mother packed

00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:22.940
for you is to strange
or to unfamiliar

00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:25.530
for others to love as you do.

00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:28.060
When even your own friend
Naja will wrinkle her nose

00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:30.660
and say what is there,
what's in there anyway.

00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:33.680
And you'll wonder how she
doesn't see the rice beneath the

00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:34.980
meat and [foreign word].

00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:36.280
You'll wonder why
she doesn't remember

00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:40.070
that rice is the most
popular food in the world.

00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:43.060
There will be times when the
climbing bars are too high,

00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:45.070
the run is to fast and far,

00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:48.220
the game isn't one you
can really ever play.

00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:50.600
I don't want them on
our team, you can watch,

00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:53.200
maybe you can have a turn later.

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:55.140
There will be times
when the world feels

00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:58.660
like a place your standing
all the way outside of.

00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:02.150
And all that stands beside
you is your own brave self,

00:21:02.150 --> 00:21:05.510
steady as steel and ready,
even though you don't

00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:07.490
yet know what you're ready for.

00:21:07.490 --> 00:21:11.440
There will be times when
you walk into a room

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:15.430
and no one there is quite like
you until the day you begin

00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:17.230
to share your stories.

00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:19.310
My name is Angelina and
I spent my whole summer

00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:21.510
with my little sister
you tell the class.

00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:24.220
Your voice stronger than
it was a minute ago.

00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:25.790
Reading books and
telling stories

00:21:25.790 --> 00:21:27.330
and even though we were
right on our block it was

00:21:27.330 --> 00:21:30.450
like we got to go everywhere.

00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:33.450
Your name is like my
sisters, Ricaberto says,

00:21:33.450 --> 00:21:35.260
her name is Angelina too.

00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:38.210
And all at once in the room
where no one else is quite

00:21:38.210 --> 00:21:42.140
like you, the world opens
itself up a little wider.

00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:44.620
To make some space for you.

00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:46.350
This is the day you begin

00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:49.580
to find the places inside your
laughter and your lunches,

00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:51.910
your books, your
travel and your stories,

00:21:51.910 --> 00:21:55.070
where every new friend has
something a little like you.

00:21:55.070 --> 00:21:58.270
And something else
so fabulously,

00:21:58.270 --> 00:22:01.510
not quite like you, at all.

00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:13.040
[ Applause ]

00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:14.340
I read the whole thing.

00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:15.640
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: She
read the whole thing.

00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:17.710
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline Woodson:
I read the whole thing.

00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:19.010
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:22:19.010 --> 00:22:20.310
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Thank you.

00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:26.410
Because when you thought about
this what were you trying to do?

00:22:26.410 --> 00:22:28.510
Give that strength?

00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:31.570
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline Woodson: I
was, the book was inspired

00:22:31.570 --> 00:22:34.120
by a passage from Brown
Girl Dreaming where I talk

00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:35.580
about my great great grandfather

00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:39.080
who is the only black
kid in his class in Ohio.

00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:47.360
In the 1920's and 30's and
growing up my mom always said

00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:50.070
to us, you know they'll be
times when you walk into a room

00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:51.370
where no one is like you.

00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:54.380
And deal with it, like
what are you going to do.

00:22:54.380 --> 00:22:56.430
And don't be afraid of it.

00:22:56.430 --> 00:23:00.360
And I think especially in
our country at this moment

00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:03.290
in time there's a lot of fear.

00:23:03.290 --> 00:23:06.720
And I think there are a lot
of people walking into rooms,

00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:09.150
young and old who
don't have a sense

00:23:09.150 --> 00:23:11.010
that they belong in that space.

00:23:11.010 --> 00:23:14.080
Or that they have a
right to that space.

00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:19.120
Or that everyone else in that
space has something in common

00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:21.700
with each other and
they're outside of that.

00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:26.950
And so I started writing The
Day You Begin to explore that

00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:31.350
and understand for myself first
because I always write books

00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:33.440
so I can have a better
understanding.

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:39.260
And then a sense of empowerment
that, that every time we walk

00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:42.430
into a room we're a
gift to that room right?

00:23:42.430 --> 00:23:47.310
You know and the room should
be happy to have us in it.

00:23:47.310 --> 00:23:54.090
So, so The Day You
Begin began from there.

00:23:54.090 --> 00:23:55.590
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Well
you are a gift to us.

00:23:55.590 --> 00:23:57.590
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline Woodson: Oh
so you are you Dr. Hayden.

00:23:57.590 --> 00:23:58.890
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: We are so glad

00:23:58.890 --> 00:24:00.990
that you walked up
on this stage.

00:24:00.990 --> 00:24:02.290
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline Woodson:
Thank you.

00:24:02.290 --> 00:24:03.590
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: So thank you.

00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:06.030
She's going to be signing books.

00:24:06.030 --> 00:24:07.570
She's going to be
answering questions.

00:24:07.570 --> 00:24:08.870
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline Woodson:
Yes thank you.

00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:10.600
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden:
Thank you so much.

00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:13.630
So let's begin to be with you.

00:24:13.630 --> 00:24:16.250
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline Woodson: Thank you
Dr. Hayden you're so brilliant.
