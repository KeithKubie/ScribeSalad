00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.500
The answer here is that the shortest path from A to B

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.420
that visits all vertices has length 19,

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:11.570
so 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and so on. You can recount if you don't trust me by now.

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.230
The number of shortest path from A to B, that again is 2.

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:20.590
So having these 2 possibilities of a shortest path

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:25.590
that visits all vertices from A to B either going this way or going this way.

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.330
That is in some way very similar to setting a variable to true or false, isn't it?

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.540
Because, if I want you to go from A to B as quickly as possible

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:40.100
while visiting all vertices, then there are only 2 choices that you have.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.920
The interesting thing is that, in one of those choices

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.260
you always take the edge that goes from bottom left to top right,

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.630
so this one here, this one here, this one here, and so on.

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:54.080
If you start out by going down right, then this is what you will do

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.830
at any other edge here as well.

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:01.230
There's no shortest path between A and B that mixes up these 2 possibilities,

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.569
so that takes some of these edges here and some of these edges here,

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:08.710
and this is exactly what we're going to use to represent a variable

00:01:08.710 --> 99:59:59.000
being set to true or false.
