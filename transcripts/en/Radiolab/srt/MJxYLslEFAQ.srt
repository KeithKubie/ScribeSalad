You are listening to radio lab radio lab

00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:07,200
from [inaudible], w.

N. Y. S. T. E. N. N. P. R.

4
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:16,780
Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert
Krulwich is this radio lab,

5
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:18,420
the podcast today on the podcast,

6
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:22,800
a story about death incarnate
and incarnate incarnate, I think.

7
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:26,370
I think incarnate and credit. If that
was Tim Howard, our producer. Sorry,

8
00:00:26,371 --> 00:00:28,610
am I in here yet? No, you're
not supposed to be come in.

9
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:33,730
You got to wait a story about death
incarnate and the man who no talking could

10
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:35,933
beat down. Yeah.

11
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:41,020
Are you in? Yeah, let's me jumped in.

12
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:45,940
Comes from my producer Tim Howard. But
you're already here. So just start. Okay,

13
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:50,500
so late last year I took a trip
out to Wisconsin guest one too.

14
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:55,390
It was like that first weekend of
November when we were out there for the,

15
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:58,030
for the live show. And I met this woman,

16
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:02,240
Ann Kez to talk about her daughter.
Gina, do you want to tell me?

17
00:01:02,241 --> 00:01:05,680
Me just like where you're
sitting, what room? Crazy story.

18
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:10,880
I am sitting in the kitchen of my
home and find the Lac Wisconsin and,

19
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:12,160
all right. So anyway,

20
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:16,590
back in 2004 and September of 2004, uh,

21
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:21,340
her daughter Gina was 15 sophomore,
I remember it was homecoming week.

22
00:01:21,341 --> 00:01:25,900
So they had all activities each day and
dress up days and Jean as a volleyball

23
00:01:25,901 --> 00:01:30,730
player. And one morning she just
starts to feel kind of crappy.

24
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:33,750
She started getting a
tingling in her left arm. Um,

25
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:37,180
we thought maybe she had a pinched nerve
or something, thought nothing of it.

26
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,650
Then she goes to a volleyball
game with somebody,

27
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:45,610
I guess sets the ball to her to spike
and she looks up and she sees two of them

28
00:01:45,611 --> 00:01:48,820
and she doesn't know which is the
volleyball double vision. Yeah.

29
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:53,710
About a week later she started getting
flu like symptoms. She has headaches,

30
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:58,450
she feels really sluggish. And
each day she just got more tired.

31
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,570
One of those days she does go
to school, take the PSA sats,

32
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:03,610
but then the next day she
can't even get out of bed.

33
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:07,240
They go to the doctor and he
says, wow, it's not the flu.

34
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:10,060
So we went home and then
she just kept getting worse.

35
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:14,520
Her arm started to involuntarily jerk. Um,

36
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:18,400
her speech started becoming
real slurred. Um, she,

37
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,770
her body kind of stiffened up.

38
00:02:20,771 --> 00:02:23,860
Like we'd get her up to go
to the bathroom and she just,

39
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:28,100
just, it was just really scary,

40
00:02:28,101 --> 00:02:32,060
weird how her body was just stiffening up.

41
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:36,050
Anne and her husband, John took her
to a neurologist for some tests,

42
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:39,020
just trying to get down to the
bottom of this, you know, and what,

43
00:02:39,021 --> 00:02:42,320
what is going on with her because
of meningitis came back negative.

44
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:44,660
Everything else that you're
testing for came back negative.

45
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:47,750
Were they running out of
things to test for? Yeah,

46
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:51,980
they pretty much didn't know what
else to do. And a day later on,

47
00:02:51,981 --> 00:02:53,900
a Saturday gene is hospitalized.

48
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:59,020
And then on Monday when her
pediatrician who had seen her on Friday,

49
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:03,460
came in and saw her and saw how
much worse she was in just two days.

50
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:06,460
He was like frazzled, like
what is going on here?

51
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:09,760
And then something just made
me tell him about the bat.

52
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:15,450
Pat. Yeah. So this was a month earlier,

53
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:20,100
Gina and her family, they were a mess.
It was St Patrick's Catholic church,

54
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:23,520
you know, old, big church, um,

55
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,910
and about was flying around and it
was just kind of bothering everybody.

56
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:30,810
It would just like land on behind the
altar of the stained glass windows up

57
00:03:30,811 --> 00:03:35,340
high. It just seemed like it wanted to
get outside and there are open windows.

58
00:03:35,341 --> 00:03:39,030
It's like go out there right
there, go. But it just,

59
00:03:39,031 --> 00:03:42,510
and then it would swoop
down and it started getting
lower to the people's heads

60
00:03:42,511 --> 00:03:46,170
and stuff. And there was an
usher, he hit it to the floor.

61
00:03:46,171 --> 00:03:47,010
I don't know what to use,

62
00:03:47,011 --> 00:03:51,720
but Gina kept looking back at
it and being the animal of her,

63
00:03:51,721 --> 00:03:55,410
she is, she thought she had to
help it. And so she jumps up,

64
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:58,740
runs over to the bat, grabs it by
the wings and takes it outside.

65
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:04,080
And as she does the bat bites her on
the index finger of her left hand.

66
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:09,840
So it breaks the skin. Yeah, they washed
it and then thought nothing of it.

67
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:14,700
But when Anne told the pediatrician
about this, his face turned white.

68
00:04:14,701 --> 00:04:16,980
He walked out of that room,
he says, I'll be right back.

69
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:21,150
But he never told us what it was. They
immediately rushed her to Milwaukee,

70
00:04:21,151 --> 00:04:25,260
to this other hospital, this hospital,
Wisconsin, to be treated by this guy.

71
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:28,380
I'm Rodney Bullet B. I am an
infectious disease consultant.

72
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:33,000
And at the point when Rodney met Gina,
she was a, what we call stuporous.

73
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:35,820
You mean like she couldn't
talk? She could, but barely.

74
00:04:35,821 --> 00:04:40,821
She was talking only single sentences
could only follow a one step command.

75
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:44,250
She was in a wheelchair because she
couldn't physically stand and her left arm

76
00:04:44,251 --> 00:04:47,910
with twitch and spasm. She
would apologize, say sorry.

77
00:04:47,911 --> 00:04:51,330
And then try and get back
into position for the exam.

78
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:55,770
And she was literally getting worse by
the minute. Within two or three hours,

79
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,810
she had to have a breathing tube put in.

80
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:02,190
She was essentially becoming
comatose the way she looked.

81
00:05:02,191 --> 00:05:06,880
I wasn't sure if she was
going to survive. Uh, and,

82
00:05:06,881 --> 00:05:10,510
and of course, if she had rabies, I pretty
much knew she wasn't going to survive

83
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:15,600
rabies. Yeah. But if you, if you are
diagnosed with rabies, then what happened?

84
00:05:15,601 --> 00:05:18,450
What do you do? Um, you,

85
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:22,830
you die basically you die.
Yeah. Well, like what?

86
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,610
All of the time. Some of
the time, all of the time.

87
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:30,750
It's a really deadly disease in terms of
the percentage of people who come down

88
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:33,780
with the symptoms of rabies, um, who die.

89
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:37,350
It is the deadliest disease in
the world. The deadliest, yeah.

90
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,310
Here's the bottom line. If we say there
are 55,000 cases of babies a year,

91
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:45,030
then you also have 55,000
rabies deaths a year.

92
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:48,720
Meaning it's a a hundred percent fatal.
Yeah. And by the way, this is Monica,

93
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:52,640
Monica Murphy. I'm a public
health veterinarian. And
this is bill bill Wassick.

94
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:52,920
Uh,

95
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:57,230
I'm a senior editor at wired magazine
and they wrote a book called Rabbit where

96
00:05:57,231 --> 00:05:59,900
they trace the history of rabies
all the way back to the beginning.

97
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:04,950
There are references to rabies going back
as far as we have human writing in the

98
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:08,020
Samarian literature in
the Acadian literature.

99
00:06:08,021 --> 00:06:12,820
So for thousands of years we have been
throwing everything and anything we can

100
00:06:12,821 --> 00:06:16,810
think of at this disease and
failing. I mean that one like real,

101
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:21,310
I mean from the star, you see these
very, very weird cures. Desperate.

102
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,500
For example, in Roman and Greek times,

103
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,990
if you're a gene and you got bit by a bat,

104
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:30,230
you might've tried eating a Cox
brain goose grease mixed with honey,

105
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:34,630
the flesh of a mad dogs, salted
skin or old slough of a serpent,

106
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:37,300
a cloud from a swallow's
nest applied with vinegar,

107
00:06:37,301 --> 00:06:40,780
and then we have the Dung of red poultry
provided it as if a red color is very

108
00:06:40,781 --> 00:06:42,610
useful. If those didn't work,

109
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:47,740
you could pull out the feathers from
around the live rooster's anus and apply

110
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:52,741
the anus to the bite wounds on the theory
that said anus would suck the poison

111
00:06:53,591 --> 00:06:56,500
up out of the wound. Wait a second.

112
00:06:57,190 --> 00:07:01,720
How would a rooster's anus cure ever
catch on in the first place? I mean,

113
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:04,720
it wouldn't work. Well, yeah,
but if you think about it,

114
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:09,780
not every rabid dog or bat bite is
actually gonna transfer the virus in the

115
00:07:10,421 --> 00:07:14,290
sense that you know, the, the saliva
just will fail to get the virus.

116
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:17,350
Where it needs to be is every so often
the healer is going to come along with

117
00:07:17,351 --> 00:07:19,330
his rooster's anus and you know,

118
00:07:19,331 --> 00:07:23,560
put it on your wound and sure
enough it works. Case closed.

119
00:07:23,561 --> 00:07:26,440
We have our, our rabies cure. Ah,

120
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:30,940
so you're saying that plenty's list is
a lot of lucky accidents by sorcerers?

121
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:35,050
Yeah. I think that lucky accidents were
kind of probably what kept some of these

122
00:07:35,051 --> 00:07:38,050
things kicking around in long enough to
become accepted. Well what do we know?

123
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,570
But rabies for real and what do we
actually know about the disease?

124
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:44,130
I mean not much. We know
it's a very unusual virus.

125
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:47,920
The way a typical virus travels
is it has a port of entry.

126
00:07:47,921 --> 00:07:51,580
It replicates locally. It makes it into
the bloodstream. It circulates widely.

127
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:55,180
It finds its target tissues and then it
replicates exactly. So you get a wound,

128
00:07:55,181 --> 00:07:58,840
it gets infected, that goes
into the blood. But rabies,

129
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:03,250
it enters the body at the bite
wound site. Say, in Gina's case,

130
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,330
the tip of her finger,

131
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:09,360
it binds to a nerve right
there to a particular receptor
and then crawls its way

132
00:08:09,941 --> 00:08:14,470
up the nervous system, one
to two centimeters per day.

133
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:16,270
That's right to attack the brain.

134
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:20,950
It literally grabs onto the nerve and
climbs up. It's like hand over hand.

135
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:24,760
Might take a few days, go the length
of a finger maybe three weeks ago,

136
00:08:24,761 --> 00:08:26,020
the length of an entire arm.

137
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:31,050
It's during that slow climb that we can
administer vaccine and help the body

138
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,070
mountain immune response.

139
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:36,580
If you give a person the vaccine
before they see symptoms,

140
00:08:36,581 --> 00:08:39,910
while the virus is still
climbing its way up to the brain,

141
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:45,090
they should be okay, but once the
infection has taken root in the brain

142
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,320
[inaudible],

143
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,820
then it's too late for vaccination.

144
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:53,670
The moment you have a
twitchy finger at the moment,

145
00:08:53,671 --> 00:08:56,340
you have like the slightest
flu like symptoms,

146
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,230
which will later progress into rabies.

147
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:01,650
That's the moment that you know
you're going to die of that disease.

148
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:04,770
What does the virus do when
it gets to the brain? Well,

149
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:09,660
it's very much not known specifically
what happens in the brain.

150
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:15,060
It might start shutting parts of your
brain down in about 30% of the cases,

151
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:17,310
the muscles might start
to kind of get paralyzed.

152
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:19,080
That's called paralytic rabies.

153
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:23,010
Eventually their entire body will get
paralyzed and they might just slump into a

154
00:09:23,011 --> 00:09:28,011
coma or more often it's that that
cliche of the rabies death is,

155
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:34,710
is what actually happens where people
have these like spasms of rage.

156
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:39,070
[inaudible].

157
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:43,120
There are videos online where you can
see people in this room. Yeah. Youtube,

158
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,940
I find them im impossible to watch

159
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:51,220
[inaudible]

160
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:53,560
you know, just screaming and
writhing and convulsions.

161
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:57,830
[inaudible]

162
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,170
and from the viruses perspective,

163
00:09:59,171 --> 00:10:03,460
it's trying to drive its host to be more
aggressive so that bites somebody else

164
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:07,930
and spreads more virus. Oh.
The other thing that is,

165
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:13,590
I find really perverse is that they
will get this fear of water or really

166
00:10:14,921 --> 00:10:18,680
powerful fear of water. The human
victim of rabies tries to drink,

167
00:10:18,681 --> 00:10:19,610
wants to drink,

168
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:23,690
but then they'll bring the cup to their
hands and digital shake and overflow the

169
00:10:23,691 --> 00:10:27,290
muscles in their throat seize up
the gag reflex and they can't.

170
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,990
They can't drink water. Yeah.
You can imagine though, again,

171
00:10:29,991 --> 00:10:32,930
from the viruses perspective,
why that would be advantageous.

172
00:10:32,931 --> 00:10:37,220
You are trying to transmit
virus through biting.

173
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:40,070
So an animal who can't swallow his,

174
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:44,960
his virus filled saliva, you're
going to be like a loaded gun. Right?

175
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:50,590
And eventually after a few
days in these late stages,

176
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:54,130
person might lapse into a
coma, have a heart attack.

177
00:10:54,131 --> 00:10:56,060
There's really any number of ways

178
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,830
you could die. That sounds
awful. In a, it was a,

179
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:02,060
it was.

180
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:06,900
So when the official results came back
and Rodney took Gina's mom and dad and in

181
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:08,590
John Keasy into a room and yeah,

182
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,010
told them we're sorry,

183
00:11:10,011 --> 00:11:14,630
but she has rabies and it's
definitely too late for the vaccine.

184
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:19,320
John and I both started crying, you know,

185
00:11:19,321 --> 00:11:22,080
is there anything that can be
done? And one of the doctors said,

186
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:26,160
there's nothing we can do. I can either
put her in a dark room and let her die.

187
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:30,390
You can take her home and
let her die and we're just,

188
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:36,000
this can't be happening. They
said, uh, what else do you got?

189
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:40,500
They said, well, we can do standard sense
of care. Well, does that work? Well?

190
00:11:40,501 --> 00:11:45,480
No. What else do you have? And
then Dr Willoughby said, OK, well,

191
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:47,400
well, I do have an idea.

192
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:53,060
I'd like to try this.

193
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:57,400
I don't even know what he called
it. Okay. So the night before,

194
00:11:57,401 --> 00:12:00,280
while they were waiting for the test
results, hoping it wasn't rabies,

195
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,360
Rodney started calling
around, you know, I,

196
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:07,120
I should call the CDC asking if there
was anything that was unpublished but

197
00:12:07,121 --> 00:12:11,350
promising they say no. And then I
essentially headed to the library.

198
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,590
And what I did is I
pulled a, I don't know,

199
00:12:14,591 --> 00:12:19,000
about 20 years with the case reports,
started readings on a pretty hopeless,

200
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:19,831
but,

201
00:12:19,831 --> 00:12:24,831
but he does notice one thing he sees
mentioned in this one kind of obscure

202
00:12:25,781 --> 00:12:27,850
paper. I read one article that said, well,

203
00:12:27,851 --> 00:12:30,850
this might be to sort of neurotransmission
yet maybe what's happening in the

204
00:12:30,851 --> 00:12:34,720
brain during rabies is something
called excited, toxicity.

205
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:39,370
Excited, excited, toxicity.
CYTO toxicity. Yeah.

206
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,500
It sounds exciting and maybe toxic.
What is it? Well, excited toxicity.

207
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:49,100
And this is, this is tricky stuff.
Um, and it's controversial. Yeah.

208
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:51,780
Is this the kind of thing that
actually makes rabies or researchers at

209
00:12:51,781 --> 00:12:56,060
conferences get into fights with each
other? Here's the basic idea. Um,

210
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:00,630
you might think that, uh,
a brain infection just
physically destroys the brain.

211
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:04,200
Yeah. But under this theory, the
brain isn't physically destroyed.

212
00:13:04,201 --> 00:13:08,880
It's just that the neurons themselves are
getting overstimulated overexcited and

213
00:13:08,881 --> 00:13:12,270
then that part of the brain is disrupted
and it all just kind of shuts down.

214
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:16,940
Just making it impossible for
the brain to function properly.

215
00:13:16,941 --> 00:13:20,330
And so the sort of life
sustaining functions of the brain,

216
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,930
like breathing and you
know, circulating blood,

217
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:27,430
they stopped working because the neurons
that control them are just overwhelmed.

218
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,790
Right. In other words, [inaudible]
doesn't destroy the brain.

219
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:32,800
It disrupts the brain.

220
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:37,840
The brain itself is spared. So
it's like a software problem,

221
00:13:37,841 --> 00:13:39,340
not a hardware problem. Yeah.

222
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:44,370
And what Rodney read is that people had
died of rabies and in the autopsy their

223
00:13:44,591 --> 00:13:49,120
brains looked totally fine.
Entirely normal. Moreover,

224
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:53,800
the virus was gone. You couldn't even
detect the rabies virus in their brain.

225
00:13:53,801 --> 00:13:56,230
Brain no longer had rabies
in it. Really? Yeah.

226
00:13:56,231 --> 00:14:00,430
It was like there was no weapon at the
scene of the crime. So that was my clue.

227
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:05,730
What that suggested to Rodney is that
the immune system does eventually turn on

228
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:11,590
right and it kicks in and it
starts fighting the disease.

229
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:16,180
But it just gets there too late. So
the immune system had all the tools,

230
00:14:16,181 --> 00:14:20,280
but essentially this virus beat
your immune system to the punch.

231
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:24,340
It would kill you faster
than immune response could
eradicate it cause the virus

232
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:27,160
moves what more quickly than
the immune system? Way Faster.

233
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,960
And to me it was like,

234
00:14:28,961 --> 00:14:33,070
well you know the solution
there is obvious and if he
could buy Jeanna's immune

235
00:14:33,071 --> 00:14:35,110
system some time, enough time,

236
00:14:35,111 --> 00:14:39,380
you could clear the brain and the brain
would not be damaged. She might survive.

237
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:46,230
So what he suggest to Anne is
that he put Jeanna into a coma,

238
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:50,460
put her into a coma,
induced the coma. And if,

239
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:55,040
if an anesthesiologist is controlling
routine brainstem activities like

240
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:56,390
breathing circulation,

241
00:14:56,391 --> 00:15:01,070
then no matter what the virus is
actually doing inside her brain,

242
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,380
he might be able to keep her alive

243
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:05,590
long enough for the immune
system. Make a response,

244
00:15:05,591 --> 00:15:07,690
which would take normally
about seven to 10 days.

245
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:11,500
And this is still kind of a guess. This
is, this is entirely improvised. Yeah.

246
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:14,590
And lots of things can go
wrong and when they go wrong,

247
00:15:14,591 --> 00:15:16,210
they typically go wrong badly.

248
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:20,420
He knows there's a huge risk that she's
going to end up being brain dead or

249
00:15:20,421 --> 00:15:21,250
maybe locked in.

250
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:23,980
And that's worse than death,
I think in everybody's eyes.

251
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:27,600
Were you nervous about the cost?

252
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:31,710
Like he said she could end up being
a vegetable just like she cried.

253
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:35,380
I don't think I thought that
far ahead. I thought more of um,

254
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:40,020
let's just keep her alive,
get the disease out of her.

255
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:43,590
So they put Jeanna into a coma.

256
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:48,950
[inaudible]

257
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:51,920
Rodney figures, we'll give her a
week and then we'll check to see

258
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,420
if she has an immune response. Um,
and once they had her hooked up,

259
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:58,690
so with the coma, she had, uh,

260
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:04,500
the pole with all the Ivy Stefan and
the different medications and stuff and

261
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:09,520
stays with Gina in the hospital room
and spends her time praying and calling

262
00:16:09,521 --> 00:16:13,360
people and asking them to pray.
And she repeated this one prayer,

263
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:17,710
psalm 91 over and over again.
It talks about, you know,

264
00:16:17,711 --> 00:16:22,630
basically the devil not getting a hold
of you. He is my refuge and my fortress,

265
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:24,460
my god in whom I trust.

266
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:29,440
Surely He will save you from the Fowler's
snare and from the deadly pestilence.

267
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:31,520
And so we were just waiting,

268
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:35,600
we'll cover you with his feathers
waiting and under his wings you will find

269
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:36,170
refuge.

270
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:39,550
It was probably the most uncomfortable
feeling I've ever had in medicine.

271
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:47,300
Seven days in, they sample her
spinal fluid, send it in for testing,

272
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,040
and then they get the results

273
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:54,670
which say, oh, her antibody responses,
uh, is then and going up, uh,

274
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:57,610
immune system is working. Yeah,
it was working in, in fact,

275
00:16:57,611 --> 00:17:01,390
we now have rabies antibody and we had
a fair amount of it and it was in the

276
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,060
spinal fluid is the meaning
of this around the brain.

277
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:08,290
And so essentially plan
worked. So we said, well, okay,

278
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:09,700
let's start waking her up.

279
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:11,080
But as they're waking her up,

280
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:15,130
she has a fever and they couldn't
figure out what was causing the fever.

281
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:20,310
So they put her back under for another
week and then finally they start to wake

282
00:17:20,441 --> 00:17:24,400
her up again. And she
gradually, you know, woke up,

283
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:27,210
the brand activity looked
great and she had nice pupils,

284
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:30,810
but physically she did not move a muscle.

285
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:33,430
[inaudible]

286
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:34,960
it pins her, they'd poke her.

287
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:39,760
She had no movement anywhere
other than her pupils. So,

288
00:17:39,761 --> 00:17:42,640
so she was responding to
light light. That's it.

289
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:46,930
And this was the one thing
that Rodney was most afraid of,

290
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,360
that

291
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,660
Gina was a lock in

292
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,410
[inaudible]

293
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:58,050
essentially locked inside
this box of a body.

294
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:01,470
And it was the worst day of my life

295
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,590
because it looked like she would progress
survive and we'd actually done worse

296
00:18:07,591 --> 00:18:10,680
than death. And as Rodney
drove back and forth from work

297
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:12,543
[inaudible]

298
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:16,370
he kept repeating this one prayer. Jesus
Christ, son of God, have mercy on me.

299
00:18:16,371 --> 00:18:20,740
A poor center. Jesus Christ,
son of God, have mercy on me,

300
00:18:20,741 --> 00:18:25,740
a poor center. Jesus Christ, son of God,
have mercy on me for center. And then,

301
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:27,630
um, about two days later,

302
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:30,770
Rodney's in the hospital and he's
looking over Gina's charts. Yeah,

303
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,940
just checking. Hello Sam. Uh,

304
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:36,930
and another doctor was finishing up her
shift and she comes over to Rodney said,

305
00:18:36,931 --> 00:18:39,450
oh, did you know that she had
reflexes today? And I said, no.

306
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:42,310
[inaudible]

307
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:46,000
Rodney grabs the reflex hammer and
then sure enough she had knee reflexes.

308
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:47,220
The next day

309
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:49,080
her eyes started flooding a little bit.

310
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:54,290
Within a week she was back for a
couple of weeks after I woke up.

311
00:18:55,621 --> 00:18:57,330
I still have no memory.

312
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:03,450
This is gene and Keasy the first person
to survive rabies without the vaccine.

313
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:07,830
Um, my first memory was
actually Thanksgiving Day,

314
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:12,620
a couple of weeks after she woke
up from the coma back in 2004. Um,

315
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:16,950
I just remember being
with my family and um,

316
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:22,560
um, playing board games with my brothers
and then just them being there and then

317
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:25,140
going down to the cafeteria for dinner,

318
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:30,810
having fish. I remember we had to fish.

319
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:34,830
How long was she in the
hospital? For? About two months.

320
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:39,180
I had to learn how to stand and
then Norwalk, um, turn around,

321
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:43,560
move my toes. Um, I was really
after reviews, you know,

322
00:19:43,561 --> 00:19:46,440
a newborn baby who couldn't do anything.

323
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:50,250
And then I had to really learn
that all. Do you remember that?

324
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:54,300
Do you remember that feeling? Yeah,
I mentally I was there, you know,

325
00:19:54,301 --> 00:19:56,670
mentally I knew how to do stuff,

326
00:19:56,671 --> 00:20:00,690
but my body wouldn't cooperate
with what I want it to do.

327
00:20:00,691 --> 00:20:05,691
And it was frustrating and it definitely
took a toll on me psychologically.

328
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:11,220
You know, I'm still recovering. I'm
not completely back. Stuff like,

329
00:20:11,221 --> 00:20:14,340
like balance and um, I can't, you know,

330
00:20:14,341 --> 00:20:18,120
run normally she can't
play volleyball anymore,

331
00:20:18,121 --> 00:20:21,240
but she finished high
school, went to college.

332
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:26,300
I graduated with a degree in just general
biology and now Gina is really into

333
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:32,880
bets. She's a bat lover. Yeah. If I
ever go down to the zoo, you know,

334
00:20:32,881 --> 00:20:34,020
they always pay,

335
00:20:34,021 --> 00:20:38,400
let me go behind and in with the baths
and I can pet them and stuff. Yeah,

336
00:20:38,401 --> 00:20:43,290
I'll feed them all. Panam I've been
going to Belfast vols here in Wisconsin,

337
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:45,900
so I have no fear of bets.

338
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:49,450
That would be the last person I would
expect to go to a bat festival. Oh,

339
00:20:49,451 --> 00:20:50,570
this girl is this scene,

340
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:55,620
that's all she is the poster child
for what became known as the Milwaukee

341
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,150
Protocol. That's the name of Rodney's,
a thing that he did with her. Yeah.

342
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,720
I mean this has been tried. Again,

343
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:05,830
this has been tried all around the
world by different people and different

344
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:10,390
versions of it, but it's been tried
to around 30 times with what result.

345
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:12,640
So everything I'm about to say forward,

346
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:16,800
there's debate about every single
little bit of it, but he says, uh,

347
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:19,960
five survivors. Five survivor. Yeah.

348
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:24,370
Out of how many people of about 30
people, which on the one hand is,

349
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:28,340
that seems like a, a terrible,
you know, percentage, uh,

350
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:32,230
for a treatment for a disease. Five
out of 30. But on the other hand,

351
00:21:32,231 --> 00:21:34,930
this is rabies and you know,

352
00:21:34,931 --> 00:21:38,170
for all of human history
it was zero out of 30. Um,

353
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:41,950
was there anything about
five that separates them
from the others? Well, this,

354
00:21:41,951 --> 00:21:46,600
this, this brings us to, uh, the,
the, the really murky territory.

355
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:50,780
You know, rapey suspend one of those,

356
00:21:50,781 --> 00:21:54,200
just really interesting pathogens to me.
The more you think you know about it,

357
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:58,670
the more you don't know about
it. This is Amy, Dr. Amy Gilbert.

358
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:03,760
I'm a research biologist at the National
Wildlife Research Center here in Fort

359
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,030
Collins.

360
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:08,300
So this gets to your question,
Robert. A couple of years ago,

361
00:22:08,301 --> 00:22:10,850
Amy actually went to study rabies in Peru.

362
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,073
Oh,

363
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:16,750
with this guy [inaudible] the
physician, but professional,

364
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:19,060
just so happen. Sergio is also from Peru.

365
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:23,980
I was born in Lima and he now works
as an epidemiologist at the CDC.

366
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:28,510
So going to, but in 2010 they
traveled deep into the Amazon jungle.

367
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:32,990
First one limo will have to travel
to Tarapoto on Fronterra Potawatomi.

368
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:36,570
We're talking remote hours from
[inaudible] was to Sanlorenzo on deploy.

369
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:37,523
They're looking for,

370
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,510
well they were studying bat born
diseases and in that part of the world,

371
00:22:40,511 --> 00:22:44,890
people have a lot of contact with
vampire paths. So we choose two towns,

372
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,140
Trina Kutcha and Santa Marta.

373
00:22:47,141 --> 00:22:51,190
So they arrive and have a pretty lengthy
discussion with the community leaders,

374
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:55,570
explain what they're up to and go
door to door, household to household.

375
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:00,520
We shit each house and talk
with one member of the family.

376
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:03,070
And they'll ask, you know, have you
been bit by a Vamp [inaudible] Bat?

377
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:06,200
Have you had any illnesses
than they take a blood sample.

378
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:11,120
And what they found is basically
rabies front page news,

379
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:14,890
11%, um, of the blood sample

380
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:16,010
bells that were tested,

381
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:20,390
seven people out of 63 had what we
call evidence of virus neutralizing

382
00:23:20,391 --> 00:23:24,500
antibodies. They had rabies
antibodies in their blood.

383
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,650
Uh, okay.

384
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:31,500
Well you know how I mentioned
that sometimes the body
will mount a response to

385
00:23:31,501 --> 00:23:36,200
rabies but it's just too late. Yeah.
So you might see those antibodies,

386
00:23:36,201 --> 00:23:39,020
but only when somebody's dying. Right.

387
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:41,390
And these people in Peru,

388
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:45,590
they had the antibodies but we didn't
have any evidence there was any

389
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:50,060
neurological disease in any of the
cases. They didn't seem to have rabies,

390
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:53,900
but we're really very surprised. I'm
sorry. Why? Well, think about it.

391
00:23:53,901 --> 00:23:57,320
The only way they could have gotten
those antibodies in their blood was by

392
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,590
contact. In some points with the virus,

393
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:04,130
they'd come into contact with
rabies and yet they were fine.

394
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:08,140
It was almost as if they
were immune to rabies. Huh?

395
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:12,630
Well, I had,

396
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:17,640
Amy won't use that word immune because
the data are sort of inconclusive as to

397
00:24:18,191 --> 00:24:20,380
whether there was any [inaudible]
the tree into the brain,

398
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:23,050
like they didn't know if the virus
made it all the way into these people's

399
00:24:23,051 --> 00:24:26,230
brains. And so did they come down
with full-blown rabies or not?

400
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:29,980
They don't know. But it's possible
that these people are special.

401
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:35,050
Some people even argue that there are
special individuals who are able to

402
00:24:35,051 --> 00:24:40,050
survive rabies and not just in Peru.
Monica told me about another case.

403
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:44,470
He, Texas wild child, your
baby's case laboratory confirmed.

404
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:48,970
Um, a girl in Texas, 17 year
old girl, I've run away,

405
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:53,110
she shows up in 2009 at a hospital
in Houston. She has a headache.

406
00:24:53,111 --> 00:24:55,930
Her neck hurts and she's really agitated.

407
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:58,510
They confirmed that it was rabies,

408
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:03,520
but she didn't receive the Milwaukee
Protocol or any critical care measures as

409
00:25:03,521 --> 00:25:06,130
far as we know. They just
figured she would die.

410
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:08,160
[inaudible]

411
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:11,450
but then three weeks later this
girl went on, you know, to,

412
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:15,960
to walk out of the hospital. She
just got better. No drugs, no coma,

413
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:18,980
nothing on her own. Huh. Wow.

414
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:22,110
[inaudible]

415
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:24,300
and this actually brings us back to Gina.

416
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:27,780
She's pretty close to normal because
at the point when she arrived at the

417
00:25:27,781 --> 00:25:29,850
hospital to see Rodney, he asked,

418
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:32,760
she was diagnosed as having small
amounts of antibody in hers.

419
00:25:32,761 --> 00:25:36,270
She already had antibody in her
blood. Like those people in Peru.

420
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:40,050
She did not have recoverable virus.
We could not isolate virus from her,

421
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,830
which is unusual. It does seem that she
is immunologically special. In fact,

422
00:25:43,831 --> 00:25:47,040
if you look at all of the people who
have gotten the Milwaukee Protocol and

423
00:25:47,041 --> 00:25:50,460
survived, they all have that
profile. Like the girl in Texas,

424
00:25:50,461 --> 00:25:51,510
like precious Reynolds,

425
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:54,660
that's another girl who got the
Milwaukee Protocol and survived.

426
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:59,550
They have had similar elaborate
comeback though. Those patients,

427
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:04,170
you know, have, have extraordinary
lab work and extraordinary outcomes.

428
00:26:04,171 --> 00:26:06,780
And so some researchers
in Canada and Thailand,

429
00:26:06,781 --> 00:26:10,400
I've argued that Rodney's protocol
actually had very little effect,

430
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:13,250
nothing to do with, and
[inaudible] surviving.

431
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:18,830
They would say she survived despite
Dr Willoughby's treatment rather than,

432
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:21,620
because I've talked to
[inaudible] treatment. Oh.

433
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:26,540
So they're accusing him of basically
pulling a rooster's anus kind of number.

434
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:31,940
Uh, I don't think they would. You
know, really put it that way. Exactly.

435
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:33,590
[inaudible]

436
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:38,590
they say that the Milwaukee Protocol
should be discontinued and that we

437
00:26:38,811 --> 00:26:41,720
shouldn't be wasting time
and money on it. You know,

438
00:26:41,721 --> 00:26:46,721
they in bank are acutely aware of the
fact that to do one Milwaukee Protocol

439
00:26:46,831 --> 00:26:48,780
case, you could vaccinate,

440
00:26:48,781 --> 00:26:52,460
I think it was all of the kids in
Bangkok preventatively against rabies,

441
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:56,710
tens of thousands of slum kids in Bangkok
could be preventatively vaccinated

442
00:26:56,711 --> 00:26:59,050
against rabies. So these
credits would say, you know,

443
00:26:59,051 --> 00:27:04,051
give people a vaccines but don't induce
the coma and don't use these untested

444
00:27:04,571 --> 00:27:06,460
drugs that Rodney administers.

445
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:10,450
And if somebody comes in with an
advanced case of rabies, well,

446
00:27:10,451 --> 00:27:13,990
unless you have evidence that they're
one of these immunologically special

447
00:27:13,991 --> 00:27:18,400
people, you just need to accept
the fact that they're going to die.

448
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:23,380
I think. No calling not to do
anything. I will definitely disagree.

449
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:26,710
We'll have to do something.
According to Sergio,

450
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:30,580
the idea that Rodney somehow just got
incredibly lucky when he was treating

451
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:35,380
Gina. Geasey does very unlikely.
Gina was basically at death's door.

452
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:38,290
And there are some things might not be
fully understanding you in that use case.

453
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:41,680
But it was obvious that itchy
was no given this alternative.

454
00:27:41,681 --> 00:27:42,880
She might not have survived.

455
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,780
And you could argue that if Jean is part
of this immunologically special group

456
00:27:46,781 --> 00:27:50,260
of people who can just survive
rabies without the vaccine,

457
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:53,200
and how come nobody did
before Rodney came along?

458
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:58,400
You know, this is really not
science. This is right now,

459
00:27:58,401 --> 00:28:02,030
storytelling does something
right, but we still don't know.

460
00:28:02,031 --> 00:28:06,880
And we won't know until we figure out
which parts work and don't work. You know,

461
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:11,030
for now, Rodney's for us to evaluate
and try to improve the protocol.

462
00:28:11,031 --> 00:28:15,980
Just one patient at a time without
the funding or research that he wants.

463
00:28:15,981 --> 00:28:19,750
So you know, no clinical trials,
no animal models. So we're,

464
00:28:19,751 --> 00:28:23,690
we're left learning the hard way, which
is an awful way to learn. But he says,

465
00:28:23,691 --> 00:28:27,290
you can't just give up hope. You know,
in the early days of cancer treatment,

466
00:28:27,291 --> 00:28:30,470
they weren't having any success,
but they didn't just stop.

467
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:35,210
And I've seen treatments for cancer
evolve over my professional career from

468
00:28:35,211 --> 00:28:38,510
being 0% survival to being 85% survival.

469
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:42,980
And now he puts the success rate of
his protocol at about 20% that's a lot

470
00:28:42,981 --> 00:28:45,720
better than zero. And it could go up,

471
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:51,850
might not go up. It's true. So
if you're a doctor now though,

472
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:56,710
and a kid comes into the
hospital, hasn't had the vaccine,

473
00:28:56,920 --> 00:29:00,400
has a full blown case of
rabies, what do you do?

474
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:04,230
Do you just derp your hands say
sorry. It's not going to make it.

475
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:07,470
Do you check and see if
maybe he's immunologically
special, put him in Tacoma.

476
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:10,780
You put him into a coma that you
don't know who's going to work,

477
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:11,801
whatever the case.

478
00:29:11,801 --> 00:29:15,880
You've actually gotta be glad that Rodney
gave Gina shot because whether or not

479
00:29:15,881 --> 00:29:19,600
you think that he saved her
life or she saved her own life,

480
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:24,400
the fact is that at least now we know
that rabies isn't quite the killer that we

481
00:29:24,401 --> 00:29:28,840
once thought it was. He took
it off of its throne of death.

482
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:31,760
Even if you know, just a little bit.

483
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,840
And when we say, you know,
maybe he's just coming off,

484
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:39,720
it's a hundred percent thrown it,
it's, you know, down to 99.999,

485
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:42,070
you know, like, it's, it might, it

486
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:46,690
might be that it was never quite on
that throne. Exactly. Ever. Right.

487
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:56,920
[inaudible]

488
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:01,650
all right. Well, uh, we've certainly
clear things up. Thank you, Tim. Yeah,

489
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:06,390
sure thing. Thanks also to Ashvin
Shaw for research help and, uh,

490
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:07,890
you guys for listening.
