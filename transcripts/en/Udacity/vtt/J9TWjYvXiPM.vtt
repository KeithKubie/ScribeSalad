00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.250
Another view which you may not have previously thought of

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:05.480
as a view is I call the book reporting view.

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.330
If you've got a, a system you're developing most shops will have some kind of

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:12.380
tool for reporting bugs.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:13.880
These are bugs during development or

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.980
these are bugs after delivery, and those bug reporting tools often have fields

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:24.640
which you fill in which indicate which component does the bug relate to.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.190
I'm suggesting that those components had better correspond to the architectural

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:31.220
components in your other views otherwise there's the potential for

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:32.189
some kind of confusion.

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:34.630
Okay?

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:38.850
Similarly, with respect to features, you would like

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.300
the person who's handling the bug to be aware of, well, this particular bug

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.740
arose when the following feature was being used by the, by the user.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.580
Here's a screen capture from a get based web browser

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:00.790
interface into a source control system in which bugs are being listed with

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.935
respect to a particular component of that system.
