00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.990
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:19.120
&gt;&gt; Sandra Charles: Good morning
and welcome to this lecture

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.300
on [inaudible] Telemedicine,

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.150
but with a whole lot
more girth to it.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.800
We are pleased to have
Professor Auffret here from --

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.430
talking to us about
artificial intelligence

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.760
and we're hearing so much.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.020
I get at least three or
four emails a day talking

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.850
about different aspects
both of AI and Telemedicine,

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.950
just all the different
terminology

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.900
and all the different ways
in which this is being used

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.470
in health services and in
aging services in particular.

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:55.850
So I was more than
happy to join Dr. Steen

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.850
and the Science Division in
bringing Professor Auffret here

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.820
and I know you're
in for a treat.

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.160
We'll be all so much more
edified when this is over

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.020
and be able to speak
about the whole topic.

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.510
And not only that, but we'll be
more encouraged and energized

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.720
to go do more research
or read more about it

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.020
because it's not a passing fad.

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.640
It is where we are and
where we are going.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.010
So I will ask Dr. Steen
to introduce our speaker

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:31.870
and I'd say sit back and be
ready for a wonderful program.

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:33.310
Thank you so much.

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.530
I encourage you -- this is
actually a part of our Health

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.580
and Wellness Programming for
the month of May, and it's sort

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.860
of the opening lecture
which we always dedicate

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.990
to some aspect of
aging and health.

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.910
And then next door will
be the various providers

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.720
that you can ask questions
on a variety of things.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.970
We have several area
hospitals participating as well

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.670
as individual pharmacies
and providers.

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.780
So we hope this day
will prove for you

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.300
to be much more energizing than
you've had in a while in terms

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.200
of thinking about
and taking care

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.930
of your health and wellness.

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.620
So thank you so much
for being here.

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:13.290
I failed to introduce
myself at the beginning.

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.050
For purposes of the program
I'm Dr. Sandra Charles,

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.050
Chief of the Health
Services Office

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.520
and also Chief Medical Officer
here at the Library of Congress.

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.810
Thank you again and welcome.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.110
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:31.820
&gt;&gt; Tomoko Steen:
It's a great pleasure

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:36.040
to [inaudible] Professor
Auffret again.

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.790
I'm Tomoko Steen,
Science, Technology,

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.200
and Business Division of here
at the Library of Congress.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:49.070
Professor Auffret last year
gave a very interesting talk

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:50.700
on cybersecurity.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.110
And this was recorded, so,
you know, please let me know.

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.130
I'm happy to show you a URL

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.760
and you can watch the
talk as well [inaudible].

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:06.730
And we are so lucky to have
Professor Auffret twice,

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:12.730
and he is a Research Partnership
Director at School of Business

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.540
as well as he's Associate
Director for the Center

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.990
for Assurance Research
and Engineering

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:23.290
at the Engineering School.

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:28.200
So he has undergraduate
degree from Duke University.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.190
He's A.B. Duke [inaudible]
and also MBA

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.180
from the University of Virginia.

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:40.140
And he's also PhD in Physics
from American University/

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.180
So he has just broad
range of background.

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.960
And he has been Director
for the MES Programs

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:50.180
at the George Mason University.

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:58.230
And also he's charity ranges
quite broad from CIO, ICT,

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:03.800
cybersecurity, so the team
explained what's CIO and ICT,

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:07.390
but it's so many, you know,

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:12.050
discussion right now
you're going to, you know,

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:13.350
[inaudible] our aging population

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.460
and this is a very
important topic.

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:20.360
So Professor Auffret
is also [inaudible]

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:24.230
for Healthy Information
Technology Advisory Committee,

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:29.350
and also worked with the
World Bank and variety

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:32.310
of important organizations
including World

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:33.990
Health Organization.

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.920
And also he was a
business executive

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.880
for the MCI and British Telecom.

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.940
He has also appointment
with Duke University Center

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:48.500
for International Development.

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.030
And he is a Physicist
in Residence

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:53.590
at American University.

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:59.080
So ICT. May be I just -- so many
people ask me about what ICT

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.640
when puts announcement.

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:05.200
It's Information and
Communication Technology.

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:09.940
And, you know, many countries
were facing such issues

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.670
of aging, how to
manage aging population.

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:19.000
So today's lecture is going to
review and analyze and status

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.300
in the potential of ICT for
healthcare in aging populations.

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:31.090
And it's a wonderful topic to
discuss and he has a broad range

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:34.800
of connection internationally
so that his topic is going

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:39.390
to cover America's,
Europe, Africa, and Asia.

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:42.130
So before [inaudible]
please join me

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:44.380
in welcoming Professor Auffret.

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:46.180
&gt;&gt; Jean-Pierre Auffret:
Thank you, Tomoko.

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:49.040
[ Applause ]

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:51.550
Where did my pen -- thank you.

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:54.900
Thank you all for joining
and thank you Dr. Charles.

00:05:54.900 --> 00:06:00.040
As Tomoko said, the talk is
going to range from healthcare

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:03.610
to aging society to
technology to policies.

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:06.650
And policies help
introduce technologies

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:08.800
into a society for healthcare.

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.160
So it will be quite a broad
range, and I'm looking forward

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:15.950
to the discussion afterwards,
including from a special guest,

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:18.080
Yuki Memora [assumed spelling],
who's also very active

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.380
in the aging society topic

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:23.610
and hosting a Washington
Innovation Network here

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:24.910
in Washington.

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:26.210
So, welcome, Yuki.

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:33.120
Shoot. Just kind
of to review then,

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:37.320
going to have some
background on aging society

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:40.850
and the technology landscape,
some of the challenges

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:45.060
in what's actually needed to
spur innovation in the field,

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:48.790
and then a little look, short
look, at National ICT Policies

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:51.580
and National Aging
Policies and Strategies.

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:55.380
Before we start, I wanted
to play a short video.

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:58.530
Just have a couple of
these from Japan on some

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:00.220
of the introduction
of technology

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:02.870
into assisted living facilities.

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:05.440
So a range of experimentation
in Japan,

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:10.630
both with the rapidly aging
society looking to further care

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:13.120
for seniors but also
to be a world leader

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:14.420
in silver technologies,

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:16.390
to be able to export
these technologies

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:18.590
to other countries
around the world.

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:21.740
We'll play this short video
on some of the applications

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:24.070
at this one nursing home,

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:25.550
and I think it gives
a pretty good feel

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:27.970
for the range of possibilities.

00:07:38.510 --> 00:08:03.650
[ Inaudible Conversations ]

00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:10.010
&gt;&gt; This [inaudible] has an
unusual [inaudible] trainer.

00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:11.620
[Inaudible] by a robot
named [inaudible].

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:14.720
It's one of many iconic
aids the staff uses,

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:23.870
including [inaudible] to help
care for it's elderly patients.

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:27.380
[Inaudible] reports, this
[inaudible] in Japan.

00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:32.240
&gt;&gt; Japan's population
is rapidly aging

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:35.830
and it's workforce is shrinking.

00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:41.240
So it's facing this new shortage
of nursing care workers to care

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:44.750
for a growing number of elderly.

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:56.170
And it's planning to turn to
robots to help fill this gap.

00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:57.880
&gt;&gt; Following [inaudible]
Japan's population [inaudible].

00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:01.270
There's been decades
of [inaudible] robots

00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:05.150
as friendly and useful.

00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:07.910
People seem [inaudible] they
think these are the human touch.

00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:14.860
&gt;&gt; And science has
made a robotic bed

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:22.030
that splits in half and half.

00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:23.330
Half of it turns
[inaudible] wheelchair.

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:28.050
Cyberdyne has made
an exoskeleton

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:32.990
that you can wear attached
to your lumbar area

00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:36.250
that helps workers lift
like people from their beds.

00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:37.810
And probably the cutest robot
is a robotic seal called

00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:39.110
[inaudible], which is used in
[inaudible] and he can respond

00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:40.410
to touch, speech, light.

00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:41.710
&gt;&gt; Tokyo sees this as a
big business opportunity,

00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:43.010
and companies have joined
them in investing million

00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:44.310
of dollars in robot R&amp;D.

00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:45.610
But they're also eyeing
potentially a bigger prize,

00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:46.910
sending these homegrown
robots overseas,

00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:49.210
especially to other nations
with populations [inaudible].

00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:54.010
&gt;&gt; Jean-Pierre Auffret: So as
you can see, a lot of potential

00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:58.270
and possibility for robots
and technologies with seniors,

00:09:58.270 --> 00:10:00.940
but also a range of issues
in regard to like innovation

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:02.520
and scaling and adoption
[inaudible] --

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:05.740
So as you could see, a lot
of potential and possibility

00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:10.300
for robots and technologies
with seniors, but also a range

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:13.000
of issues in regard
to innovation

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.480
and scaling and adoption.

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:17.970
And we'll cover some of those
during the course of the talk.

00:10:23.050 --> 00:10:26.440
Aging isn't just
limited to Asia Pacific.

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:29.210
It's a worldwide
phenomena, aging societies.

00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:32.370
So many of the European
countries

00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:37.790
across Asia Pacific including
Japan, Korea, Singapore, Taiwan,

00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:41.250
China itself because of some of
their policies over the years,

00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:44.540
some of the South American
countries like Argentina

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:47.980
and Chile, and some of the
Middle Eastern countries, too,

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:51.500
and North African countries
such as Algeria and Iran,

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:53.640
all aging quite rapidly.

00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:57.010
And over the coming years
going to be approaching 25-30%

00:10:57.010 --> 00:10:59.290
or even 40% in Japan's case,

00:10:59.290 --> 00:11:02.770
of the population being
65 years and older.

00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:05.470
So significance aside
all challenge,

00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:08.460
and for many countries
the risk is

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:12.320
of becoming older before they
become developed or richer.

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:16.260
So for a country like
Japan or Korea or some

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:19.620
of the European ones which are
very successful economically,

00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:23.080
have public health
infrastructure in place,

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:26.730
their much in better
circumstances for aging society

00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:29.640
than a developing country that
doesn't have public health

00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:33.160
yet or, indeed, has a
relatively low GDP as some

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:34.460
of the developing countries do.

00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:38.830
We'll see in a little bit, too,
it's also a phenomenon in Africa

00:11:38.830 --> 00:11:42.460
where some of the African
countries projected not

00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:45.160
to have 40% of their
population, but up to 20%

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:52.210
of their population age 65
and older by the year 2050.

00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:57.440
So aging oftentimes is depicted
as homogenous, or one view,

00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:00.010
of what aging is or
what aging means.

00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:02.440
But, really, aging
is quite varied.

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:08.350
Many seniors now and over
the years quite active well

00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:11.170
into their 60s, 70s,
80s, and 90s --

00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:14.030
active in society,
active working.

00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:17.810
Other seniors, more and more,
are trying to age in place

00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:20.150
and there's different policies
around the world for that --

00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:23.060
to be able to stay living
in their homes longer

00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:25.440
as a way to stay engaged.

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:28.950
But also too many seniors
do have fragility issues

00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:31.550
and then some also
have memory issues.

00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:34.570
So very broad range of
seniors and a very broad range

00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:38.280
of technologies which are
applicable to each of the groups

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:42.580
or circumstances of the seniors.

00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:45.750
And we'll also see that, how the
technologies are being tailored,

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:48.700
including fostered and
promoted by the U.S. Government

00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:52.620
for different types or
circumstances of seniors.

00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:58.610
One thing which is a
major challenge worldwide,

00:12:58.610 --> 00:13:00.920
and we'll talk about some of
the other challenges of aging

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:05.030
in addition to health, is
this question of poverty.

00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:09.070
Seniors oftentimes, and in many
countries, don't have pensions

00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:10.980
or something has
happened to the pension

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:13.450
such as municipal bankruptcy,

00:13:13.450 --> 00:13:16.740
or a country doesn't have
a pension system yet,

00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:19.680
and when the senior's no longer
working then then don't have a

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:20.980
regular income.

00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:22.430
One other thing which
is happening

00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:25.190
in many countries is
a change of culture.

00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:29.010
So many countries traditionally
have had a cultural support

00:13:29.010 --> 00:13:33.300
system where the young care
for and support the parents

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:35.170
and the grandparents
and the elderly.

00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:38.260
That is changing in
many countries now,

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:42.500
including in Asia Pacific
where sometimes the youth moves

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:45.450
to the larger cities,
but the seniors remain

00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:49.860
in the rural areas, and there's
not the contact or support

00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:52.880
that that might have
been in previous decades.

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:56.470
One other issue, too, is with
the rapidly aging society,

00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:57.890
instead of having six or seven

00:13:57.890 --> 00:14:03.170
or eight younger people
supporting the seniors

00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:07.240
through pensions or care, in
some countries it's moving

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:10.510
to three to one or two to one,

00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:13.700
two people in the workforce
supporting one senior person.

00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:17.600
So the support system
may or may not be there

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:21.300
from country to country.

00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:24.350
So aging varies across
the world, and aging, too,

00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:28.540
varies across the U.S.
but by county and city.

00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:32.940
Some counties and cities
much more older than others.

00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:37.780
On this slide here, darker
blue is a higher percentage

00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:44.590
of a county with a population
of age 65 and over including

00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:47.800
with a disability,
so having both.

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:52.580
You can see many counties
have a bluer shade

00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:54.220
and are older than others.

00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:56.790
Oftentimes these
are in rural areas.

00:14:56.790 --> 00:14:59.360
I grew up in Florida
which has an interesting

00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:00.660
population dynamic.

00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:05.080
It's both a very large senior
population but also quite young

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:08.560
and somewhat limited in
the middle over the years.

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:11.790
So you can see some of
these counties quite rural,

00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:13.520
quite limited incomes.

00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:17.650
With some of the healthcare
policy we've had or some

00:15:17.650 --> 00:15:20.510
of the circumstances with
those rural hospitals closing

00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:24.010
and support systems not being
what they might be, and so here,

00:15:24.010 --> 00:15:28.110
too, in the United States, aging
can be a challenging issue.

00:15:28.110 --> 00:15:30.980
One other note on
disparities in health.

00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:34.020
There's the -- have many
of you heard about or read

00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:36.130
about the stroke belt?

00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:39.590
Also a major public
health issue.

00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:43.230
So there's a band across
northern North Carolina,

00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:46.220
southern Virginia going
across into Kentucky,

00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:49.260
and the population there
has incidents of stroke

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:53.310
at a much earlier age and
much higher preponderance

00:15:53.310 --> 00:15:54.810
than across the rest
of the country.

00:15:54.810 --> 00:15:58.600
So it's a little bit unclear
as to the causes of that.

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:00.960
Some mix of probably
genetics and diet.

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:04.410
But there, too, there's
a disparity of incidents.

00:16:04.410 --> 00:16:05.930
And we'll come back
to that when we talk

00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:08.970
about fragility for seniors.

00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:13.070
Here's another chart.

00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:16.280
This one is population
over 65 by county.

00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:19.080
So you see some of the very
popular retirement areas

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:21.290
in Palm Springs, also Florida,

00:16:21.290 --> 00:16:24.670
but also quite varied
across the country.

00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:29.150
Oftentimes younger
working-age move

00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:31.100
to where economies
are more dynamic,

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:32.540
but true around the world.

00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:38.910
But here, too, in the U.S.
Do quite a lot with APEC.

00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:43.650
APEC, Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperative,

00:16:43.650 --> 00:16:47.510
a multilateral organization
of 21 or 23 countries

00:16:47.510 --> 00:16:49.540
around the Asia Pacific
Region, and here, too,

00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:53.960
you can see the vast differences
in percentage of aging.

00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:58.800
And also vast differences
in type of economy and level

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:01.210
of development of economy.

00:17:01.210 --> 00:17:04.430
So quite striking the
projection for year 2050,

00:17:04.430 --> 00:17:06.710
the right-hand column.

00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:12.970
Japan projected 42.5% of
the population 65 and older.

00:17:12.970 --> 00:17:15.240
Korea, which has had
the lowest birthrate

00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:20.100
for many years now, 41.5%.

00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:21.400
Really quite interesting.

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:25.470
Thailand, a middle
income country, at 37.1.

00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:27.940
So it really varies
across the world.

00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:34.250
So impact on society and
social inclusion, productivity,

00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:41.590
all those types of things
related to demographics.

00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:44.130
These also quite
striking type of maps --

00:17:44.130 --> 00:17:49.140
this is year 2000
on the upper map,

00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:55.630
darker brown the code is
more aged like 25 or 30%

00:17:55.630 --> 00:17:57.900
or over, 65 and older.

00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:00.860
But the bottom map,
world map, is 2050.

00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:03.760
And you can see that the shift
in colors over the years.

00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:07.360
Not very many countries would
[inaudible] dark browns.

00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:18.900
If you can bear with me in
2050 [inaudible] not others.

00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:20.200
Oh, yes. Thank you.

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:21.500
[Inaudible] gave a talk
last year in Argentina.

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:24.940
It was partially related to
productivity in the workforce.

00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:28.230
So Argentina, a middle
income country,

00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:31.900
although with a somewhat sad
political history and sadly back

00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:34.230
in the news again recently.

00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:37.540
But here, too, you can see
that the shift in population

00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:41.540
and the increasing number
of elderly, decreasing size

00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:44.650
or stable size of the workforce.

00:18:44.650 --> 00:18:48.530
So a challenge for Argentina
to increase productivity

00:18:48.530 --> 00:18:52.610
to help address their debt
issues to be as dynamic

00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:54.840
as they could be
with their economy.

00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:58.630
And think this is the most --

00:18:58.630 --> 00:19:02.170
really quite amazing chart
in regards to demographics.

00:19:02.170 --> 00:19:05.420
So China with the highest
population in the world,

00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:07.940
but not for very much longer.

00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:12.730
So quite rapidly aging with the
one child policy over the years.

00:19:12.730 --> 00:19:16.010
Relatively soon and
into the 2040s

00:19:16.010 --> 00:19:20.370
and 2050s the India workforce
going to be much, much,

00:19:20.370 --> 00:19:22.220
much larger than China.

00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:25.090
So great ramifications
for China in regard

00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:27.460
to competitiveness
and productivity.

00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:32.010
I didn't bring any
charts on this, but China,

00:19:32.010 --> 00:19:33.830
the most rapid adopter

00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:38.460
in manufacturing,
one of, of robotics.

00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:40.770
And partially it's to
remain competitive.

00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:43.510
Partially, too, it's with --
in regard to their aging issue.

00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:48.050
[ Inaudible Conversations ]

00:19:48.050 --> 00:19:51.660
Okay. One of the challenges
I mentioned is the this issue

00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:53.900
of workforce and productivity,
and we'll come back

00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:56.320
to health in a second.

00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:59.630
So the Korean population
somewhat flat

00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:03.890
and will be declining a little
bit over the coming years

00:20:03.890 --> 00:20:06.260
as their population ages.

00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:12.350
Their productivity as a country
has been flat or decreasing.

00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:16.940
They're of a size where it's
quite challenging economically,

00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:18.830
so they're not as large

00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:21.960
in population-wise
as a U.S. or a Japan.

00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:24.330
They have about 50
million people.

00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:28.160
So for Korea to maintain
competitiveness in the face

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:32.000
of a flat or declining
population is a great challenge

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.300
for them.

00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:37.610
Also, too, they have structural
limitations from policies.

00:20:37.610 --> 00:20:42.260
So the retirement age
is quite low in Korea.

00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:45.910
They're working to develop
policies and approaches to --

00:20:45.910 --> 00:20:48.020
so people can stay
in the workforce.

00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:50.890
Traditionally what's happened
is someone will retire

00:20:50.890 --> 00:20:54.080
from a very skilled
or skill-oriented job

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:58.150
and not really have anything
to move to that's comparable,

00:20:58.150 --> 00:20:59.880
and might end up doing something

00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:03.200
that is not taking
advantage of their talents.

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:04.570
So they're trying
to address that.

00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:07.140
They're also trying
to address some

00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:09.970
of the employment
challenges that they have.

00:21:09.970 --> 00:21:12.100
They're dominated by the
very large conglomerates

00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:14.650
such as the one Samsung is in.

00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:17.150
Limited opportunity for youth.

00:21:17.150 --> 00:21:21.410
And so there's an office
right here on Gallows Road.

00:21:21.410 --> 00:21:27.890
It's related to the Korea U.S.
Science Technology Center.

00:21:27.890 --> 00:21:31.940
But what it does is it enables
Korean companies the opportunity

00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:36.480
to come here to the U.S. to
further their exports or look

00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:38.920
to see if the U.S. is
a good market for them.

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:41.980
And then the Korean
government also has 14 offices

00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:45.720
around the world for recent
Korean university graduates

00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:48.360
to go overseas to get a couple
of years of university --

00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:51.710
work experience before
coming back to Japan.

00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:54.300
So Korea, in that middle
size, and it's going

00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:58.770
to be quite a challenge as
that they -- the society ages.

00:21:58.770 --> 00:22:02.150
Pensions, too, can be a
great challenge worldwide.

00:22:02.150 --> 00:22:06.600
So some countries don't have
pension systems developed yet.

00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:11.580
Others have quite robust pension
systems that are under-funded.

00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:14.790
This was a news headline
from Stockton, California,

00:22:14.790 --> 00:22:19.670
a number of years ago when
their city went bankrupt.

00:22:19.670 --> 00:22:22.730
And so there was a risk
to both the pensions

00:22:22.730 --> 00:22:26.570
of their former municipal
employees but also

00:22:26.570 --> 00:22:27.870
that the healthcare benefit

00:22:27.870 --> 00:22:31.410
that the city was
purchasing for retirees.

00:22:31.410 --> 00:22:33.590
So pensions can be a
big, big, big challenge

00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:39.790
and a big issue both for
developed and developing.

00:22:39.790 --> 00:22:42.740
A couple of other notes on major
trends before we focus more

00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:45.500
on the technology in healthcare
that are related to aging.

00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:46.800
One is urbanization.

00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:51.460
Many of the young move to the
outskirts of the larger cities

00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:54.920
in developing countries,
the larger mega-cities.

00:22:54.920 --> 00:23:01.140
Lagos, for example, has grown
from about 500,000 population

00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:02.810
to about 20 million
over the course

00:23:02.810 --> 00:23:06.810
of the last several decades,
so really rapid growth

00:23:06.810 --> 00:23:08.470
in a country like Nigeria.

00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:10.730
But many, many cities
around the world.

00:23:10.730 --> 00:23:15.760
Countries struggle to provide
city services, provide jobs.

00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:19.470
It's also -- help address
social inclusion issues.

00:23:19.470 --> 00:23:23.590
And so with aging, it's
just adds to the challenge

00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:25.810
or compounds the challenge.

00:23:25.810 --> 00:23:30.500
One interesting phenomena
in Japan, very recently.

00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:33.310
So Professor Obio
[assumed spelling],

00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:36.210
a colleague of Yuki's.

00:23:36.210 --> 00:23:39.280
Over many years, the youth
were moving to the cities

00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:42.630
and the elderly were
staying in the rural areas.

00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:45.570
Now more and more of the youth
are looking to the rural areas

00:23:45.570 --> 00:23:48.100
for their livelihoods, and
there's been a little bit

00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:53.730
of a pendulum shift in Japan but
with, I think, a lot of benefits

00:23:53.730 --> 00:23:59.020
for a more heterogeneous
society in the rural areas.

00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:04.170
Here's a slide showing
the recent change

00:24:04.170 --> 00:24:08.670
of the preponderance of
population living in cities.

00:24:08.670 --> 00:24:13.270
So, of course, here, it's been
many, many decades since --

00:24:13.270 --> 00:24:14.920
the crossing point
is when the more

00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:17.230
than 50% were living in cities.

00:24:17.230 --> 00:24:22.430
So many, many decades here
and in Argentina and Europe.

00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:24.950
But worldwide, only
fairly recently

00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:29.570
that that the cities have become
the main hub of livelihood

00:24:29.570 --> 00:24:30.870
in many, many countries.

00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:36.800
And this also really
kind of interesting

00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:38.760
from a map standpoint.

00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:40.960
This is 1970.

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:46.850
Darker color brown is more
higher percentage urban.

00:24:46.850 --> 00:24:50.830
And then this is 2030.

00:24:50.830 --> 00:24:53.760
You can see many, many more
countries have a higher

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:55.860
percentage of urban living,

00:24:55.860 --> 00:24:59.640
but also the red circles
are larger cities,

00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:01.760
like over 10 million in size.

00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:05.740
So big shift in how people
live and related to aging.

00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:10.530
And then other big shift related
to aging is chronic illness.

00:25:10.530 --> 00:25:15.330
So also only recently
was a shift --

00:25:15.330 --> 00:25:18.770
that from worldwide mortality go

00:25:18.770 --> 00:25:21.360
from the preponderance
being communicable diseases

00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:23.540
to the preponderance
being chronic illness.

00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:27.250
And so with aging -- with
seniors living longer,

00:25:27.250 --> 00:25:30.590
and with improvements in
healthcare, more and more

00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:33.190
of a challenge of
chronic illness.

00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:37.090
But also this is true worldwide,
not just with seniors.

00:25:37.090 --> 00:25:41.760
With chronic illness,
it's a much different type

00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:44.270
of healthcare than with
communicable disease,

00:25:44.270 --> 00:25:48.510
much more focus on
continuity of fit care,

00:25:48.510 --> 00:25:54.740
engaging of allied health,
role of diet, role of adherence

00:25:54.740 --> 00:26:01.870
to medical recommendations,
and a much more important role

00:26:01.870 --> 00:26:05.390
of health literacy on the
part of the population.

00:26:05.390 --> 00:26:10.680
To show that it's quite
international, India,

00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:16.480
for example, has a very high
like occurrence of diabetes,

00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:19.020
one of the highest in the world.

00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:22.190
And interestingly enough, the
higher occurrence in the world

00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:24.740
of Hepatitis C is Egypt.

00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:27.990
And it came about from
a public health failure.

00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:29.300
The Egyptian Government was --

00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:32.870
they had a parasitic Nile River
disease, and they were trying

00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:35.530
to inoculate the population
against this in the '60s,

00:26:35.530 --> 00:26:38.080
but they were using
dirty needles.

00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:42.630
And so now they have a really
major Hepatitis C incidence

00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:43.930
in Egypt.

00:26:43.930 --> 00:26:48.230
But there, too, chronic
illness being a worldwide issue.

00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:52.610
And here -- this was a diabetes.

00:26:52.610 --> 00:26:56.360
And you can see darker green is
higher incidents of diabetes.

00:26:56.360 --> 00:27:02.860
So Mexico, Libya, Saudi,
Arabia, India, fairly high.

00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:07.420
Quite varied around
the world of that.

00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:11.080
Okay. So what's happening in
technology that's really a plus

00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:13.870
or an opportunity for
healthcare and for seniors

00:27:13.870 --> 00:27:17.590
and for staying connected and
for living, aging in place,

00:27:17.590 --> 00:27:20.970
and living longer, and more
engaged in active lives.

00:27:20.970 --> 00:27:28.190
A lot of it has to do with the
mobile phone and with sensors,

00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:31.090
as with a lot in our society.

00:27:31.090 --> 00:27:34.070
So the advances have
been quite remarkable,

00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:36.240
and the opportunity
quite remarkable, too,

00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:38.480
for really connecting
people with services

00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:40.910
that they didn't have
access to before.

00:27:40.910 --> 00:27:45.050
So just in 2015, already
7 billion mobile phone

00:27:45.050 --> 00:27:49.750
subscribers, more than one for
every person on the planet.

00:27:49.750 --> 00:27:52.770
And it's not just
-- it's worldwide.

00:27:52.770 --> 00:27:54.940
It's developing countries
and developed.

00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:56.970
A little bit less
so in rural areas,

00:27:56.970 --> 00:27:59.250
and a little bit less
so in some countries.

00:27:59.250 --> 00:28:01.830
But these mobile
phones with the power

00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:04.570
of computers providing services

00:28:04.570 --> 00:28:10.260
that weren't really forecastable
10 or 15 or 20 years.

00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:13.400
Also, too, this -- the more
and more increasing number

00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:16.790
of connected devices
and sensors as we'll see

00:28:16.790 --> 00:28:19.560
for assisted technology
really providing capability

00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:23.510
that wasn't there before in
the whole mobile app inroads.

00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:29.040
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:31.400
One kind of note which I
think is neat in regard

00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:34.960
to how rapidly technology
changes and how it's difficult

00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:38.750
to forecast where it may
be in 10 or 20 years --

00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:43.110
these are just pictures,
but -- of status storage,

00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:46.240
transmission speed,
and processing power.

00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:50.800
But just to show how far
we've come, the first one --

00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:52.620
so say you can go
into a computer store

00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:56.520
and buy a several
terabyte storage like near

00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:58.200
where I live, where we live.

00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:01.670
It's like 30 or $40 or $50
for like three terabytes,

00:29:01.670 --> 00:29:04.210
and it's the size of a book.

00:29:04.210 --> 00:29:09.650
The first commercially available
gigabyte storage was just 1980,

00:29:09.650 --> 00:29:13.410
so not that long ago in many
ways, and it was 550 pounds,

00:29:13.410 --> 00:29:17.000
the size of a refrigerator,
and cost $40,000.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.230
And it was marketed by IBM.

00:29:19.230 --> 00:29:23.530
So from this and one gigabyte
of $40,000 to about this

00:29:23.530 --> 00:29:27.810
for multiple terabytes from
$50 has been the change.

00:29:27.810 --> 00:29:29.890
And so that change
is continuing.

00:29:29.890 --> 00:29:33.240
And so the underlying cost of
storage, the variable cost,

00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:35.620
is going to be almost
zero shortly.

00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:38.420
The processing speeds similarly.

00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:43.020
So now it's six, seven, or
eight going in cycles a second

00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:45.050
in a computer on research.

00:29:45.050 --> 00:29:46.650
Kind of a coincidence --

00:29:46.650 --> 00:29:52.210
the first lunar lander and also
the first Apple computer were

00:29:52.210 --> 00:29:55.350
both 2000 cycles a second.

00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:59.050
So from 1970 to today,
from 2000 to 8 billion,

00:29:59.050 --> 00:30:00.770
and that's advancing, too.

00:30:00.770 --> 00:30:06.100
And then the transmission speed
-- the first transatlantic cable

00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:10.920
from 1957 could only handle
about 36 simultaneous calls.

00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:14.250
And now it's billions
and billions of calls

00:30:14.250 --> 00:30:16.390
on a fiberoptic network.

00:30:16.390 --> 00:30:18.550
So with those trends continuing,

00:30:18.550 --> 00:30:20.900
just as you couldn't really
foresee the capability

00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:24.420
of the iPhone if you
were back in 1990,

00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:26.520
you can't really foresee
what the computers

00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:29.140
or the phones will
be doing in 2025.

00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:33.310
You have an idea of what the
applications might be in regard

00:30:33.310 --> 00:30:37.440
to [inaudible] with cars
and sensors or with videos

00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:39.790
and images and holograms,

00:30:39.790 --> 00:30:42.050
but the specific
applications you can't really --

00:30:42.050 --> 00:30:43.830
it's hard to visualize.

00:30:43.830 --> 00:30:48.850
This is a neat resource that
comes out every fall from ITU,

00:30:48.850 --> 00:30:51.170
a Measuring Information Society.

00:30:51.170 --> 00:30:53.490
The blue line that's going

00:30:53.490 --> 00:30:57.130
up towards 100% is mobile
phone subscriptions,

00:30:57.130 --> 00:31:00.680
so about 100 mobile phone
subscriptions per 100 people

00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:01.980
around the world.

00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:05.890
The really dark blue one that's
quite steep on the right --

00:31:05.890 --> 00:31:07.860
that's mobile broadband
subscriptions.

00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:09.820
And you can see that's
increasing more rapidly

00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:14.220
than mobile phone, so probably
in several years we'll be

00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:18.560
up to 70, 80, 90 mobile
broadband subscriptions per 100

00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:21.170
population around
the world, developed

00:31:21.170 --> 00:31:22.550
and developing countries.

00:31:22.550 --> 00:31:25.340
So great, great, great change.

00:31:25.340 --> 00:31:28.850
And this, too, I think
is another background

00:31:28.850 --> 00:31:31.340
on what's possible,
what technology.

00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:38.550
For Mexico's to the left, shows
the percentage of the population

00:31:38.550 --> 00:31:42.260
in Mexico that is banked
or has bank accounts.

00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:44.520
The right shows the percentage

00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:47.080
of the population
with a mobile phone.

00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:49.200
So much, much, much higher.

00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:53.160
So Mexico, one of the countries
where these types of apps,

00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:57.450
where you can do banking through
the phone like M-Pesa in Kenya,

00:31:57.450 --> 00:31:59.440
really making inroads.

00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:02.640
So instead of having traditional
bank accounts, going to one

00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:04.990
of these phone-based
bank systems

00:32:04.990 --> 00:32:06.780
and really providing access.

00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:10.250
And so -- also for health, too.

00:32:10.250 --> 00:32:14.710
Of course, the whole smart
city playing a big role

00:32:14.710 --> 00:32:19.670
in aging society as we'll talk
about as well as the smart grid,

00:32:19.670 --> 00:32:23.460
so really changes in how
electricity is provided.

00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:27.620
I didn't include a slide,
but Africa, for example,

00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:31.110
just in the last 20 years and
projected out to 2020 the amount

00:32:31.110 --> 00:32:33.550
of power which has
been brought online,

00:32:33.550 --> 00:32:37.070
and related to the phones,
or enabling the phones,

00:32:37.070 --> 00:32:40.190
has really led to major shifts.

00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:43.180
One other video I want to
play before we talk more

00:32:43.180 --> 00:32:45.880
about health is not
all technology has

00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:47.930
to be really leading edge.

00:32:47.930 --> 00:32:51.550
And it's possible to do things
in health with technology

00:32:51.550 --> 00:32:54.670
that is somewhat
dated such as SMS.

00:32:54.670 --> 00:32:57.240
And there's some
wonderful examples

00:32:57.240 --> 00:32:59.430
around the world
including here in the U.S.

00:32:59.430 --> 00:33:04.710
of using SMS-type technology to
really further health outcomes

00:33:04.710 --> 00:33:09.120
and benefit seniors in a
way just as much as some

00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:11.520
of the more advanced
robotic or AI technologies.

00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:16.550
So this is a really neat
initiative in Tanzania

00:33:16.550 --> 00:33:22.510
with Novartis and IBM.

for children under the age

very, very high incidence

of malarial medicine
stock-outs in rural clinics.

00:35:26.740 --> 00:35:28.780
And so with Novartis and IBM

00:35:28.780 --> 00:35:30.840
and a telecom [inaudible]
developed a system

00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:34.210
where the clinician would
just send a text message

00:35:34.210 --> 00:35:37.180
in once a week on
her inventory level.

00:35:37.180 --> 00:35:39.690
And if the inventory was
low or nearing a stock-out,

00:35:39.690 --> 00:35:41.230
it would be replenished.

00:35:41.230 --> 00:35:45.060
And they went from 80% or
so stock-outs to a very,

00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:48.270
very small number with
the corresponding benefit

00:35:48.270 --> 00:35:50.340
for the children and
for children's health.

00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:54.040
There's a number of amazing
examples similar to this.

00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:58.420
Pharmaceutical counterfeiting
is rampant in some countries.

00:35:58.420 --> 00:36:02.770
And an almost similar
system in one or two

00:36:02.770 --> 00:36:06.250
of the West African countries
is you don't buy the medicines

00:36:06.250 --> 00:36:09.840
from a pharmacy like
we do here, like a CVS.

00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:13.090
It's more from a small shop.

00:36:13.090 --> 00:36:16.280
But just a code on the side of
the medicine that you can type

00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:18.830
into your -- send a text
message with your phone

00:36:18.830 --> 00:36:21.990
and it validates
it that it's real.

00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:28.070
So here we have a new law that's
going to take effect early 2020s

00:36:28.070 --> 00:36:30.660
on a pharmaceutical
traceability.

00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:34.280
And the -- what the legislation
calls for is the ability

00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:38.030
to trace a pharmaceutical all
the way from manufacturing plant

00:36:38.030 --> 00:36:41.590
to when we actually pick
it up at the pharmacy.

00:36:41.590 --> 00:36:45.320
And so much more advanced
than this text message idea.

00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:48.580
But some of the pharmaceutical
companies are looking

00:36:48.580 --> 00:36:51.310
at block chain for
that, for example.

00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:56.830
Okay. So technology doesn't need
to be advanced, but, of course,

00:36:56.830 --> 00:37:01.030
a lot of the technologies are
advanced including with robotics

00:37:01.030 --> 00:37:05.700
with a lot of promise for
seniors but a lot of promise

00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:08.680
for society and a
lot of risk also.

00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:12.300
The Asian Development Bank
puts out an annual report

00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:16.190
in the spring, and it
just came out this year.

00:37:16.190 --> 00:37:20.460
And they have a fascinating
chapter on the job impact

00:37:20.460 --> 00:37:23.340
in developing Asia
countries from robotics.

00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:27.780
It was quite a, I thought,
sophisticated study

00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:31.450
because they had the downside
risk industry by industry,

00:37:31.450 --> 00:37:32.940
from country to country.

00:37:32.940 --> 00:37:34.910
They also had the
upside potential

00:37:34.910 --> 00:37:37.000
of access to the job markets.

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:42.070
And then they also
looked at a forecasting

00:37:42.070 --> 00:37:44.260
when robotics would
be adopted industry

00:37:44.260 --> 00:37:48.110
by industry based upon the cost,
the economic opportunity as well

00:37:48.110 --> 00:37:51.240
as the technological capability.

00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:54.310
But many robots used for
different applications.

00:37:54.310 --> 00:37:58.060
The one on the bottom right
is an English-speaking robot

00:37:58.060 --> 00:38:00.970
in Korea which is
really a popular teacher.

00:38:00.970 --> 00:38:04.610
The upper left is the
more traditional view

00:38:04.610 --> 00:38:06.340
of industrial robots.

00:38:06.340 --> 00:38:08.240
But you can see by
comparing the two,

00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:10.900
that the robots are
quite different.

00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:16.270
So robots are becoming
more non-tethered.

00:38:16.270 --> 00:38:21.040
But the one on the left is
tethered and stationary.

00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:25.850
More mobile and non-tethered,
more autonomous

00:38:25.850 --> 00:38:29.070
and more interactive
and in some ways more

00:38:29.070 --> 00:38:32.100
"intelligent," in quotes.

00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:34.770
So through all of that,
much greater interaction

00:38:34.770 --> 00:38:37.250
with humans and individuals.

00:38:37.250 --> 00:38:41.800
And so many more risks
for the individual.

00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:46.240
Many more societal implications
and public policy implications

00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:50.800
as these larger and faster
robots are interacting

00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:52.140
on a day-to-day basis.

00:38:52.140 --> 00:38:54.180
So there's a lot of studies

00:38:54.180 --> 00:39:00.990
which are really quite
interesting on the use of robots

00:39:00.990 --> 00:39:03.480
and humans together
as to whether

00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:08.590
or not a human plus a robot has
greater capability than a human

00:39:08.590 --> 00:39:10.700
on its own or a robot
on its own.

00:39:10.700 --> 00:39:16.020
In one of the studies which gets
quoted a lot is a chess study.

00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:18.100
So pairing -- this is
from several years ago --

00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:23.510
pairing the chess-playing
programs that the real top ones

00:39:23.510 --> 00:39:26.580
and the not quite top ones
-- with chess-playing humans,

00:39:26.580 --> 00:39:29.100
really, really top ones
and not so top ones.

00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:32.470
And the winning teams from
the experiment were --

00:39:32.470 --> 00:39:36.640
it wasn't that the best human
or the best robot or AI.

00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:40.050
It was the one that
worked best together.

00:39:40.050 --> 00:39:43.010
And you can see that's going
to be a factor in many fields.

00:39:43.010 --> 00:39:45.520
So, for example,
medical diagnosis --

00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:49.190
the IBM Watson does
commercials quite --

00:39:49.190 --> 00:39:51.610
or commercials about
Watson quite often.

00:39:51.610 --> 00:39:55.850
Doctors are using Watson at
Cleveland Clinic I believe.

00:39:55.850 --> 00:39:59.890
But there it's an interaction
of what the AI tells the doctor

00:39:59.890 --> 00:40:02.700
and what the doctor
interprets and what the --

00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:07.420
what information that the
Artificial Intelligence provides

00:40:07.420 --> 00:40:10.030
to the doctor so the
doctor can make a judgment

00:40:10.030 --> 00:40:11.330
over how accurate it is.

00:40:11.330 --> 00:40:15.980
One kind of aside on that.

00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:19.340
It's a major, major
issue that this question

00:40:19.340 --> 00:40:23.500
of artificial intelligence
and transparency.

00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:27.660
Here in the U.S.,
but also in Europe,

00:40:27.660 --> 00:40:31.120
and there's a really
interesting case with Zillow.

00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:32.910
Does anyone follow that case?

00:40:32.910 --> 00:40:36.660
So many of you probably
use Zillow or seen it.

00:40:36.660 --> 00:40:41.430
So Zillow is a home
and condominium site.

00:40:41.430 --> 00:40:43.480
And one of the things
it has on there in order

00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:47.310
to draw traffic is
it has an algorithm

00:40:47.310 --> 00:40:52.920
that generates what a house
is worth or valued or would go

00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:54.290
for on the open market today.

00:40:54.290 --> 00:40:59.190
And so you can go on there
any day and type in a property

00:40:59.190 --> 00:41:01.890
or your own address and
see what it's valued at.

00:41:01.890 --> 00:41:05.550
It also has a chart for
historical estimates as well

00:41:05.550 --> 00:41:07.560
as for the neighborhood.

00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:13.020
And so an attorney saw that
her house was being undervalued

00:41:13.020 --> 00:41:16.980
on Zillow, a very, very nice
house, high-priced house,

00:41:16.980 --> 00:41:20.850
and it was hindering
her ability to sell it.

00:41:20.850 --> 00:41:27.430
And so she sued Zillow and
-- but Zillow didn't --

00:41:27.430 --> 00:41:30.970
and so the judge wanted
to see how Zillow operated

00:41:30.970 --> 00:41:33.440
and how Zillow came
up with the estimate

00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:35.230
of what the house was worth.

00:41:35.230 --> 00:41:40.680
But Zillow said it was a trade
secret, how it was doing it.

00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:44.250
So the judge had to make
arrangements to hire an expert,

00:41:44.250 --> 00:41:48.510
but the plaintiffs paid,
to review the system

00:41:48.510 --> 00:41:51.600
in order to make a judgment.

00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:55.160
So that works in the cases when
it's an algorithm or can work,

00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:57.370
but in these issues --

00:41:57.370 --> 00:42:00.660
circumstances with machine
learning that the AR

00:42:00.660 --> 00:42:04.150
or the machine gathers
information from the Internet

00:42:04.150 --> 00:42:09.030
and then slowly over time
develops an insight and a view.

00:42:09.030 --> 00:42:11.950
It's much harder,
if not impossible,

00:42:11.950 --> 00:42:13.470
to know how the machine came

00:42:13.470 --> 00:42:16.920
up with its recommendation
or solution.

00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:21.440
But the laws now in Europe
-- there's a transparency law

00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:25.120
and algorithms that
you have to be able

00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:29.440
to show how a computer
arrived at a decision.

00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:34.330
And also, too, that there's
laws so that someone can ask

00:42:34.330 --> 00:42:38.470
for a human to make a
choice instead of a machine.

00:42:38.470 --> 00:42:43.270
So as an example, a university
hypothetically could use a

00:42:43.270 --> 00:42:49.700
computer to decide who's
admitted, really quite possible.

00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:54.160
And some jurisdictions have
experimented with computers

00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:57.660
as to whether or not someone
should be paroled or whether

00:42:57.660 --> 00:43:00.300
or not they'll be at
risk if they're paroled.

00:43:00.300 --> 00:43:05.680
So the -- a lot of the policy
orientation is what recourse

00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:09.790
does an individual have because
you can't really depose the

00:43:09.790 --> 00:43:14.590
computer necessarily, and
then so what recourse is,

00:43:14.590 --> 00:43:16.190
and how do you know
how it made its choice?

00:43:16.190 --> 00:43:19.360
And then what can you
really do about it?

00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:20.660
Or even, for example,

00:43:20.660 --> 00:43:26.050
if a autonomous vehicle caused
an accident when you go --

00:43:26.050 --> 00:43:28.760
and if someone was going to
sue the insurance company,

00:43:28.760 --> 00:43:32.160
you can't really depose it, or
how do you find out about it?

00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:35.270
This is actually in
interesting picture, too.

00:43:35.270 --> 00:43:37.720
So this is an assisted
robot for Japan.

00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:43.320
So with a rapidly aging society,
limitations on the number

00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:50.440
of health workers to assist --
so this one to help lift someone

00:43:50.440 --> 00:43:55.260
out of a bed and move
from one bed to another

00:43:55.260 --> 00:43:57.430
or when a bed is being made.

00:43:57.430 --> 00:44:01.580
You can imagine the legal
risk on something like that.

00:44:01.580 --> 00:44:05.830
As it turns out in the
U.S. that there are --

00:44:05.830 --> 00:44:09.500
every year there's an
incidence of people being,

00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:12.430
patients being dropped
in hospitals, too.

00:44:12.430 --> 00:44:17.590
So -- but that one
being adopted in Japan.

00:44:17.590 --> 00:44:18.890
And I think we would
see something

00:44:18.890 --> 00:44:21.780
like that here over time also.

00:44:21.780 --> 00:44:27.350
One of the arguments from the
autonomous vehicle providers is

00:44:27.350 --> 00:44:31.940
that the autonomous vehicle will
be safer than a human driver.

00:44:31.940 --> 00:44:34.650
But that's not the view
of all the car companies.

00:44:34.650 --> 00:44:36.920
Toyota, for example,
their view is more

00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:39.220
that the autonomy is assistive.

00:44:39.220 --> 00:44:42.540
And so there's a range of
circumstances where visibility

00:44:42.540 --> 00:44:45.440
and rain, when the
autonomy is really helpful.

00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:47.680
But not at all times
necessarily.

00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:52.750
This is a very famous
Japanese robot,

00:44:52.750 --> 00:44:55.480
Chihira Kanae, from Toshiba.

00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:58.210
One thing to note
is Japan's going

00:44:58.210 --> 00:44:59.920
to be really highlighting robots

00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:02.760
for the 2020 Olympics,
including at Narita.

00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:04.950
But there's different
cultural views

00:45:04.950 --> 00:45:08.760
of what a robot should
look like.

00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:14.270
So, in Japan they have the video
reference Paro for the autism

00:45:14.270 --> 00:45:18.910
and aging, a very cute
and attractive seal.

00:45:20.440 --> 00:45:22.300
This robot looks
much, much different.

00:45:22.300 --> 00:45:25.450
So this one looks as if a human.

00:45:25.450 --> 00:45:28.440
So there's cultural
differences on that.

00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:31.540
So I think in the U.S., this
is a broad generalization,

00:45:31.540 --> 00:45:34.140
but for the most part,
our robots are idealized

00:45:34.140 --> 00:45:37.620
to some extent, and
less human looking.

00:45:37.620 --> 00:45:40.780
But some countries,
they do have robots

00:45:40.780 --> 00:45:42.820
that are a little bit
more human looking.

00:45:42.820 --> 00:45:45.950
So, again, cultural
differences in robots.

00:45:45.950 --> 00:45:52.210
Here's a initiative here
from the U.S., from HHS.

00:45:52.210 --> 00:45:54.830
Research -- I think
this was from last year,

00:45:54.830 --> 00:45:58.420
the announcement request
for proposal for robotics

00:45:58.420 --> 00:46:01.010
with Alzheimer's assistance.

00:46:01.010 --> 00:46:05.920
So many, many opportunities
for research grants in --

00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:10.060
at the end here, I'll discuss
a little bit how our government

00:46:10.060 --> 00:46:11.670
tries to catalyze research.

00:46:11.670 --> 00:46:15.800
I have to be very
cognizant of the time.

00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:19.540
Two other areas which the great
[inaudible] impact for seniors,

00:46:19.540 --> 00:46:22.510
nonhealthcare, is one
is autonomous vehicles.

00:46:22.510 --> 00:46:25.720
This is actually
a drone in Rwanda.

00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:27.610
So Rwanda's very hilly.

00:46:27.610 --> 00:46:32.160
And so this commercial company
to deliver fixed-wing drone,

00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:34.260
deliver medicines to rural areas

00:46:34.260 --> 00:46:36.830
because the roads aren't
necessarily that good.

00:46:36.830 --> 00:46:39.930
And they do deliveries
within two or three hours.

00:46:39.930 --> 00:46:42.960
They can get their order
in and ship it out.

00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:46.960
But the point more in general
is that autonomous vehicles,

00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:49.690
especially for seniors
living in rural areas

00:46:49.690 --> 00:46:51.390
where they've lost
the bus routes,

00:46:51.390 --> 00:46:53.110
which happens all
over the world.

00:46:53.110 --> 00:46:55.560
Now with autonomous
vehicles there's a way

00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:57.700
where the senior could
actually have a vehicle

00:46:57.700 --> 00:47:00.690
that can bring them into town
or they'd be much more mobile

00:47:00.690 --> 00:47:04.320
and more able to live
and age in place.

00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:09.370
This is just kind of -- this
is a autonomous drone in Dubai.

00:47:09.370 --> 00:47:13.700
I don't think I would get into
one like that, but that's there.

00:47:17.370 --> 00:47:22.880
And then, too, the artificial
intelligence becoming much

00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:25.040
more flexible.

00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:29.650
So chess, although very
complex and complicated,

00:47:29.650 --> 00:47:33.800
somewhat limited in regard
to its one application.

00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:38.230
But more and more some of the AI
applications are quite flexible

00:47:38.230 --> 00:47:40.190
as to what they're doing

00:47:40.190 --> 00:47:44.070
and quite large ramifications,
I think, for society.

00:47:44.070 --> 00:47:50.030
We use AI every day, most
every one of us, in some ways.

00:47:50.030 --> 00:47:54.550
So, for example, someone
going shopping on Amazon,

00:47:54.550 --> 00:47:57.930
and the recommendations
that come from Amazon,

00:47:57.930 --> 00:48:01.430
sometimes they're a
little bit creepy I think,

00:48:01.430 --> 00:48:03.190
the types of things
that they do.

00:48:03.190 --> 00:48:08.250
But a lot of that is from
AI and gathering information

00:48:08.250 --> 00:48:11.080
about a person and then
utilizing it in a way

00:48:11.080 --> 00:48:14.100
to [inaudible] back
a recommendation.

00:48:14.100 --> 00:48:17.120
There's a projection
for Philippines

00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:19.550
that in the next two years
they're going to lose 30%

00:48:19.550 --> 00:48:22.940
of their call center employees.

00:48:22.940 --> 00:48:26.830
So Philippines, a major
industry with call centers.

00:48:26.830 --> 00:48:30.580
So you call from here
and you get someone

00:48:30.580 --> 00:48:33.480
from Philippines quite often.

00:48:33.480 --> 00:48:36.690
So a lot of the first and
second level that the levels

00:48:36.690 --> 00:48:40.360
with not the huge expertise,
the projection is they're going

00:48:40.360 --> 00:48:43.970
to be replaced by automated
assistants in the next years.

00:48:43.970 --> 00:48:47.010
So a very, very big
issue for Philippines

00:48:47.010 --> 00:48:49.900
with job replacement and AI.

00:48:49.900 --> 00:48:52.940
And then the last thing
[inaudible] trend, I think,

00:48:52.940 --> 00:48:57.050
is this open data issue that
the data being available

00:48:57.050 --> 00:49:00.650
and the potential both for
benefit for seniors but also

00:49:00.650 --> 00:49:04.390
for society in building
businesses.

00:49:04.390 --> 00:49:07.630
So here in our area we have
a quite robust open data,

00:49:07.630 --> 00:49:08.960
the federal government
obviously,

00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:12.540
the counties, New York, too.

00:49:12.540 --> 00:49:17.570
Some of the really neat
applications I think is what you

00:49:17.570 --> 00:49:19.860
can do with trending
over time for seniors.

00:49:19.860 --> 00:49:23.400
There's a really neat
company here locally.

00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:25.970
It's now possible to get from --

00:49:25.970 --> 00:49:32.040
a [inaudible] from HHS much
more quickly than years ago,

00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:36.960
information on Medicare and
Medicaid payments and care.

00:49:36.960 --> 00:49:40.880
And it's six months
or probably less now.

00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:45.650
And so local company here
obtains the information

00:49:45.650 --> 00:49:51.290
from HHS, then they're able
to do comparisons from region

00:49:51.290 --> 00:49:54.380
to region or from hospital
system to hospital system

00:49:54.380 --> 00:49:57.910
and provide the information back
out to enable the caregivers

00:49:57.910 --> 00:50:00.920
to hopefully provide
better care.

00:50:01.960 --> 00:50:05.520
Okay. So how is technology
actually being used for aging?

00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:08.280
And it really varies
by the type of --

00:50:08.280 --> 00:50:11.060
where the senior is in aging.

00:50:11.060 --> 00:50:14.870
So again in place,
an active aging type

00:50:14.870 --> 00:50:17.700
of technology may
well be in exercise

00:50:17.700 --> 00:50:19.380
or an autonomous vehicle.

00:50:19.380 --> 00:50:24.150
Someone who's a little bit
more fragile might be assisted

00:50:24.150 --> 00:50:27.360
for mobility or for sight
or with chronic illness.

00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:30.130
Then, too, for memory care,

00:50:30.130 --> 00:50:35.210
such as with the Paro
from Japan, the seal.

00:50:35.210 --> 00:50:37.510
So aging very, very,
very different.

00:50:37.510 --> 00:50:40.280
And then also the
government services vary too.

00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:42.180
The one on the right
from New Jersey I think,

00:50:42.180 --> 00:50:46.200
a really important type of
initiative in times of emergency

00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:49.060
to know where the seniors
are, to know where the ones

00:50:49.060 --> 00:50:52.100
who have memory issues are so
you're able to better evacuate.

00:50:52.100 --> 00:50:54.930
So it's a huge impact
and benefit both

00:50:54.930 --> 00:50:58.910
to the senior themselves
and to the city if you know

00:50:58.910 --> 00:51:04.100
where everyone in your city
is who needs an oxygen tank

00:51:04.100 --> 00:51:06.930
in regard -- if the
power goes off.

00:51:06.930 --> 00:51:11.320
So those types of things
are big, big benefit.

00:51:11.320 --> 00:51:13.430
One of the things
I think that --

00:51:13.430 --> 00:51:17.600
really quite important in aging
is this concept of fragility.

00:51:17.600 --> 00:51:22.580
There's probably 80 different
models of how to define it now.

00:51:22.580 --> 00:51:27.440
But fragility both of movement,
but also fragility of health --

00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:33.040
inability to take a number of
stresses to a person's system.

00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:35.260
So someone very young
in their 20s,

00:51:35.260 --> 00:51:38.950
they can take multiple
health stresses and be fine.

00:51:38.950 --> 00:51:41.360
But someone older is
much, much more difficult.

00:51:41.360 --> 00:51:46.610
Fascinating study
from Japan on seniors.

00:51:46.610 --> 00:51:50.280
And this is with
fragility in movement.

00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:53.070
It's very, very -- their study
found that it's very difficult

00:51:53.070 --> 00:51:57.930
if you move from quite active
to limited mobility and fragile

00:51:57.930 --> 00:52:03.140
in movement, and then almost
non-mobility to go back,

00:52:03.140 --> 00:52:05.880
to make your way back
from very limited --

00:52:05.880 --> 00:52:10.120
almost no mobility to
fragile and fragile to active.

00:52:10.120 --> 00:52:13.540
So a lot of the interventions
are to --

00:52:13.540 --> 00:52:17.250
if someone is to prevent
someone or help someone

00:52:17.250 --> 00:52:20.090
so they don't move
to the next stage.

00:52:20.090 --> 00:52:23.690
And there's also models like
this for cognitive fragility

00:52:23.690 --> 00:52:25.560
and the intersections
of the two,

00:52:25.560 --> 00:52:27.750
more physical and
more confident.

00:52:27.750 --> 00:52:30.740
But a lot of the technologies
are oriented towards this type

00:52:30.740 --> 00:52:34.960
of idea that to help someone
stay in an earlier stage,

00:52:34.960 --> 00:52:39.190
a more healthy stage,
and help them move back

00:52:39.190 --> 00:52:43.830
or to the extent it's
possible as they move further.

00:52:43.830 --> 00:52:47.070
Because everyone knows someone
who's gone ill when they're

00:52:47.070 --> 00:52:51.040
in their 70s or 80s, and it's
much more difficult recovery,

00:52:51.040 --> 00:52:54.120
much more challenging or a
fall is much more challenging.

00:52:54.120 --> 00:53:00.580
This is a similar model for WHO
on functioning and disability.

00:53:00.580 --> 00:53:03.960
It's quite a similar idea,
but here it's the degree

00:53:03.960 --> 00:53:09.690
of societal participation and
then functioning, physical

00:53:09.690 --> 00:53:13.220
and mental functioning in
the intersection of the two.

00:53:13.220 --> 00:53:16.220
So the point being
there's a great benefit

00:53:16.220 --> 00:53:19.820
from engaging societally
or with family and a risk

00:53:19.820 --> 00:53:21.120
from social inclusion.

00:53:21.120 --> 00:53:26.170
And so -- and also a benefit
from some physical activity.

00:53:26.170 --> 00:53:29.430
So what are some of
the technologies?

00:53:29.430 --> 00:53:32.260
This is really a quite
neat one I think.

00:53:32.260 --> 00:53:33.750
And this is an [inaudible].

00:53:33.750 --> 00:53:38.680
Canada has, and Taiwan and New
Zealand is actually a leader

00:53:38.680 --> 00:53:44.250
in this, have implemented these
fairly widely in some cities.

00:53:44.250 --> 00:53:47.180
So enabling the phone
or the cane

00:53:47.180 --> 00:53:51.480
with communications
technologies to connect

00:53:51.480 --> 00:53:53.240
to beacons or sensors.

00:53:53.240 --> 00:53:57.610
So a lot of the sight-impaired
now have GPS on the phone

00:53:57.610 --> 00:53:59.830
that can direct them to a
place where there's GPS.

00:53:59.830 --> 00:54:03.790
But if in a very large
building or a subway station,

00:54:03.790 --> 00:54:07.030
they don't have the GPS.

00:54:07.030 --> 00:54:10.790
But to put beacons in there
and to communicate back

00:54:10.790 --> 00:54:16.040
with the cane or the phone or
the eyeglasses as in Canada,

00:54:16.040 --> 00:54:19.140
and really help someone
there with their mobility

00:54:19.140 --> 00:54:22.020
and their confidence
to get around.

00:54:22.020 --> 00:54:24.310
And it can be really
very, very lifechanging.

00:54:24.310 --> 00:54:27.430
There's a video, which
I'm not going to show,

00:54:27.430 --> 00:54:31.550
of someone about 30 years
old who -- in Canada --

00:54:31.550 --> 00:54:35.130
who lost their sight
through diabetes.

00:54:35.130 --> 00:54:40.330
And she now has these types of
technologies and is really able

00:54:40.330 --> 00:54:43.830
to get around and do quite well.

00:54:43.830 --> 00:54:49.840
So a wonderful lady
at NIH who also --

00:54:49.840 --> 00:54:53.440
who lost her sight
when she was about 25

00:54:53.440 --> 00:54:56.790
and she afterwards moved --

00:54:56.790 --> 00:54:59.620
started in information
technology and, again,

00:54:59.620 --> 00:55:03.710
is able to do tremendously with
the assistance of technologies.

00:55:03.710 --> 00:55:08.080
This is a second one,
cognitive ability,

00:55:08.080 --> 00:55:11.200
which a lot of technology's
very helpful with.

00:55:11.200 --> 00:55:16.180
Both continuing with -- to
be engaged, but also some

00:55:16.180 --> 00:55:19.710
of the technologies more and
more able to identify trends

00:55:19.710 --> 00:55:22.920
and patterns for
early intervention.

00:55:22.920 --> 00:55:26.020
For example, with
dementia or Alzheimer's.

00:55:26.020 --> 00:55:29.060
So I think with a lot
that's being done nowadays,

00:55:29.060 --> 00:55:31.590
a lot of potential.

00:55:31.590 --> 00:55:34.410
One thing that's
kind of interesting.

00:55:34.410 --> 00:55:38.540
A George Mason professor I
work with has worked on this.

00:55:38.540 --> 00:55:41.900
The way someone uses their
Smartphone is very unique.

00:55:41.900 --> 00:55:45.380
You can identify someone
from the Smartphone usage.

00:55:45.380 --> 00:55:48.640
So, of course, the intelligence
agencies are very interested

00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:50.260
in that sort of thing.

00:55:50.260 --> 00:55:52.770
But also, too, there's a thought

00:55:52.770 --> 00:55:56.660
that over time someone
might have a change

00:55:56.660 --> 00:55:59.060
in Smartphone pattern usage,

00:55:59.060 --> 00:56:00.950
how they actually type
on the Smartphone.

00:56:00.950 --> 00:56:04.840
And you can identify
insipient dementia from that.

00:56:04.840 --> 00:56:07.390
So there's a number of
projects like that both here

00:56:07.390 --> 00:56:11.390
and the U.S. but
around the world.

00:56:11.390 --> 00:56:14.690
This is a DARPA Drive
technology.

00:56:14.690 --> 00:56:18.700
Really tremendous
potential for seniors

00:56:18.700 --> 00:56:20.930
for mobility and staying active.

00:56:20.930 --> 00:56:22.660
This is an exoskeleton.

00:56:22.660 --> 00:56:26.340
But many, many different
ways of doing this.

00:56:26.340 --> 00:56:28.610
There's a number of
technologies that haven't worked

00:56:28.610 --> 00:56:32.220
yet that I think are really
interesting if they could work.

00:56:32.220 --> 00:56:38.080
Types of technologies that a
senior could wear, very light,

00:56:38.080 --> 00:56:42.690
that would expand, for example,
on a fall to make it less likely

00:56:42.690 --> 00:56:44.390
that a fall would
be catastrophic.

00:56:44.390 --> 00:56:49.950
You're tied with sensors so
you might have an iPhone.

00:56:49.950 --> 00:56:53.360
This is a local company
here in Fairfax

00:56:53.360 --> 00:56:55.400
which is really kind
of remarkable.

00:56:55.400 --> 00:57:01.250
So they have this -- the EyeGaze
Technology has come a long way.

00:57:01.250 --> 00:57:03.670
At Consumer Electronics
Show they had an exhibit,

00:57:03.670 --> 00:57:06.430
a company on exhibit this year
where you could drive a car just

00:57:06.430 --> 00:57:09.720
by moving your eyes
and steer it.

00:57:09.720 --> 00:57:11.160
This company here -- this is

00:57:11.160 --> 00:57:14.640
for someone who's had a
really catastrophic accident

00:57:14.640 --> 00:57:19.280
and is paralyzed from neck
down -- that they can --

00:57:19.280 --> 00:57:22.960
someone can actually type and
write by moving their eyes

00:57:22.960 --> 00:57:25.400
on this keyboard on this screen.

00:57:25.400 --> 00:57:29.370
And when they come -- and we've
had several assisted technology

00:57:29.370 --> 00:57:33.380
conferences, and the company
comes and gives a demo,

00:57:33.380 --> 00:57:36.440
and some of their customers
come with stacks of books

00:57:36.440 --> 00:57:38.430
that they've written
using this technology.

00:57:38.430 --> 00:57:42.730
So it's for someone in
that sad circumstance.

00:57:42.730 --> 00:57:44.030
It's really lifesaving.

00:57:44.030 --> 00:57:48.900
It gives them a real path to
life I think, in livelihood.

00:57:48.900 --> 00:57:51.410
A lot of the senior
technology --

00:57:51.410 --> 00:57:55.040
this is for [inaudible] you
know, profession soccer players,

00:57:55.040 --> 00:57:58.600
but we [inaudible] this as
senior technology with sensors.

00:57:58.600 --> 00:58:01.700
So this technology here,
which is being adapted,

00:58:01.700 --> 00:58:05.690
is having a communications
device in the soccer ball

00:58:05.690 --> 00:58:09.650
and having sensors around
the stadium, and then also

00:58:09.650 --> 00:58:12.400
on each player having a
communications device.

00:58:12.400 --> 00:58:14.930
So you're able to track the ball

00:58:14.930 --> 00:58:20.480
and all the players
in real time.

00:58:20.480 --> 00:58:24.810
And then make judgments
about how they're playing

00:58:24.810 --> 00:58:26.960
and how often they
have to have the ball.

00:58:26.960 --> 00:58:29.180
So their golf technology --

00:58:29.180 --> 00:58:30.930
if you ever watch gold
on T.V. they have --

00:58:30.930 --> 00:58:34.000
they can actually track the
speed of the ball off the club,

00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:37.700
and they do it with baseball
now, too, and follow the path.

00:58:37.700 --> 00:58:40.140
But this having a big impact.

00:58:40.140 --> 00:58:43.000
And then lastly, too, on
chronic disease management,

00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:47.850
this is a Google
initiative for diabetes.

00:58:47.850 --> 00:58:52.600
So being able to tell
insulin levels from tears

00:58:52.600 --> 00:58:56.110
with a contact lens,
communicating either to a phone

00:58:56.110 --> 00:59:01.050
or to a SmartGlass, and then
being able to provide a warning

00:59:01.050 --> 00:59:02.810
if the insulin levels are --

00:59:02.810 --> 00:59:06.030
or the patients are outside
of some sort of control

00:59:06.030 --> 00:59:09.850
and that's -- so better care and
more stability of blood levels.

00:59:09.850 --> 00:59:13.560
So, again, a neat thing that
technology's making possible.

00:59:13.560 --> 00:59:16.840
So to wrap up, what are
some of the major challenges

00:59:16.840 --> 00:59:19.290
of getting these types of
technologies to seniors

00:59:19.290 --> 00:59:22.800
and to patients in general?

00:59:22.800 --> 00:59:28.090
What is the phone coverage
and digital divide?

00:59:28.090 --> 00:59:34.200
So even though there's almost
one phone per worldwide

00:59:34.200 --> 00:59:38.830
inhabitant, in some areas the
phone coverage can be a little

00:59:38.830 --> 00:59:41.610
bit iffy, the broadband
coverage.

00:59:41.610 --> 00:59:44.320
And so that can be a
major, major issue.

00:59:44.320 --> 00:59:49.380
Health literacy could be a
major issue and challenge, too.

00:59:49.380 --> 00:59:52.590
I think this goes
both ways though.

00:59:52.590 --> 00:59:57.310
So there's -- health
literacy is important

00:59:57.310 --> 01:00:00.820
for using the technology
but the technology can help

01:00:00.820 --> 01:00:02.120
with health literacy.

01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:07.590
There's a Georgetown company
right there by the canal

01:00:07.590 --> 01:00:10.300
and they were -- they provide

01:00:10.300 --> 01:00:15.780
through Smartphones
text messages

01:00:15.780 --> 01:00:21.610
to low income expectant
mothers, about-to-be mothers.

01:00:21.610 --> 01:00:25.490
And their service was
highlighted by President Obama

01:00:25.490 --> 01:00:29.160
and they're in many
hospitals nowadays with this,

01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:32.510
and they've had -- they were
able to demonstrate a benefit

01:00:32.510 --> 01:00:36.940
for both maternal
health and infant health.

01:00:36.940 --> 01:00:39.440
So the messages are
coming from pediatricians,

01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:43.300
so they're real healthcare
providers.

01:00:43.300 --> 01:00:45.800
But they're able to
demonstrate that type of benefit

01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:49.140
through the technology,
and it's measurable.

01:00:49.140 --> 01:00:53.240
Doctor engagement also, too.

01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:55.180
This varies by culture.

01:00:55.180 --> 01:01:00.270
So in many or most countries'
cultures there's a hierarchy

01:01:00.270 --> 01:01:01.680
that a doctor, being quite --

01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:04.330
very, very well respected,
obviously.

01:01:04.330 --> 01:01:09.540
But the technology changes
the dynamic a little bit.

01:01:09.540 --> 01:01:13.700
And it changes it
differently country by country.

01:01:13.700 --> 01:01:16.440
So in some countries the
patient's very empowered

01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:19.110
and the doctors don't
necessarily like that.

01:01:19.110 --> 01:01:23.350
In some other instances,
the technology

01:01:23.350 --> 01:01:24.710
and the information
the patient has may

01:01:24.710 --> 01:01:26.830
or may may not be
all that helpful.

01:01:26.830 --> 01:01:28.280
One thing that's very much

01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:31.500
in the news is electronic
medical records

01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:33.220
in patient reporting,

01:01:33.220 --> 01:01:36.850
and to what degree patient
reporting is helpful

01:01:36.850 --> 01:01:39.920
to a doctor.

01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:42.600
And some of the better
electronic medical records flag

01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:44.940
the provenance of the
data as to whether it's

01:01:44.940 --> 01:01:48.530
from a real healthcare
provider or from the patient.

01:01:48.530 --> 01:01:51.840
And one also interesting
aspect of that is there's more

01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:54.190
and more consumer
technology that people wear

01:01:54.190 --> 01:01:56.660
like Pit Bitz and things.

01:01:56.660 --> 01:01:59.660
Many, many, which are
quite high quality.

01:01:59.660 --> 01:02:04.630
So the information is 7 by 24
as opposed to clinical trials

01:02:04.630 --> 01:02:07.190
where you go to the hospital
once a week and you're tested.

01:02:07.190 --> 01:02:09.870
And so there's a couple
of clinical trials --

01:02:09.870 --> 01:02:11.960
one at Duke and one
at Stanford --

01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:16.290
to use commercially-available
technology with 7

01:02:16.290 --> 01:02:18.920
by 24 information
and then seeing

01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:23.880
if you can make a judgement on
a new other device or treatment.

01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:26.550
Some of the other
issues -- I'll skip some.

01:02:26.550 --> 01:02:29.020
Obviously payer models.

01:02:29.020 --> 01:02:31.160
Reimbursement really,
really important

01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:33.900
for any technology
to be adopted.

01:02:33.900 --> 01:02:37.530
Here in the U.S., our
laws changed last year.

01:02:37.530 --> 01:02:42.310
So, historically,
for telemedicine --

01:02:42.310 --> 01:02:45.370
for telemedicine to be
reimbursed you have to be

01:02:45.370 --> 01:02:47.680
in a medically underserved area

01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:53.400
which was most often a rural
area, or a city, a very,

01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:57.030
very urban inner-city-type area.

01:02:57.030 --> 01:03:00.830
But it changed last year, so
it's much more reimbursable now

01:03:00.830 --> 01:03:04.150
to -- - - for -- to --
back to the insurers.

01:03:04.150 --> 01:03:09.260
And also more -- Medicare and
Medicaid more open to paying.

01:03:09.260 --> 01:03:11.690
Standards, obviously,
interoperability.

01:03:11.690 --> 01:03:16.460
Market size has to have
a financial benefit

01:03:16.460 --> 01:03:18.590
to private sector companies.

01:03:18.590 --> 01:03:21.440
And then adoptability.

01:03:21.440 --> 01:03:25.560
Some companies and some
research projects are fantastic

01:03:25.560 --> 01:03:30.110
at engaging seniors and
engaging the patients in design.

01:03:30.110 --> 01:03:31.410
Others not so.

01:03:31.410 --> 01:03:33.150
I think that's true
with IT in general.

01:03:33.150 --> 01:03:36.380
Some of the IT development
projects are fantastic

01:03:36.380 --> 01:03:38.910
in engaging users in advance.

01:03:38.910 --> 01:03:41.570
And then others not so
much oriented that way,

01:03:41.570 --> 01:03:43.780
and the system is finished
and might not be all

01:03:43.780 --> 01:03:45.470
that fit for a purpose.

01:03:45.470 --> 01:03:48.540
So engaging the users
is very important.

01:03:48.540 --> 01:03:52.940
I'll wrap up in a second.

01:03:52.940 --> 01:03:55.390
This dual use idea is really
quite interesting, too.

01:03:55.390 --> 01:04:00.520
A lot of commercial --
military technologies are being

01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:05.530
repurposed for aging
and for assistive needs.

01:04:05.530 --> 01:04:08.920
Some of the hand motion
technologies being adapted

01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:13.120
for autism and autistic
children.

01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:16.560
Another need autism technology
-- this is local also.

01:04:16.560 --> 01:04:24.110
For a severely autistic child
they have 20 or 30 caregivers,

01:04:24.110 --> 01:04:26.710
so they have -- well,
the parents, obviously.

01:04:26.710 --> 01:04:28.770
And then they have
psychologists,

01:04:28.770 --> 01:04:30.210
they have language therapists,

01:04:30.210 --> 01:04:32.530
they have their teachers
in the schools.

01:04:32.530 --> 01:04:35.250
So many physical therapists
and many, many, many.

01:04:35.250 --> 01:04:37.500
And as they go through
the course of the day,

01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:43.480
periodically a child like that
might have a emotional incident

01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:44.780
or outburst.

01:04:44.780 --> 01:04:48.460
But they're somewhat
predictable and the technology

01:04:48.460 --> 01:04:49.760
with this company
here locally --

01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:52.620
they try to connect the
caregivers in the chain,

01:04:52.620 --> 01:04:56.150
and if an early-morning
caregiver sees a sign,

01:04:56.150 --> 01:05:00.410
they'll flag it to the next ones
so that they can react to --

01:05:00.410 --> 01:05:03.840
interact with the child
differently based upon how the

01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:06.010
child's day is going.

01:05:06.010 --> 01:05:08.460
So again, just phone
technology but kind of neat.

01:05:08.460 --> 01:05:12.230
And lastly, policy is
very, very important.

01:05:12.230 --> 01:05:15.390
Most countries now have
national ICT policies.

01:05:15.390 --> 01:05:19.170
And then most have
also ageing policies.

01:05:19.170 --> 01:05:22.650
It's the rare country where
there's an intersection

01:05:22.650 --> 01:05:26.240
of the two, where
there's a connectedness

01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:28.280
of the ageing and ICT.

01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:30.560
But tremendous potential.

01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:33.320
Japan is connected there.

01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:34.620
Theirs is quite well.

01:05:34.620 --> 01:05:36.750
But others are working on it.

01:05:36.750 --> 01:05:40.800
And then one last note here in
the U.S. I think one of the --

01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:44.020
two of the best things we do
from a technology standpoint.

01:05:44.020 --> 01:05:47.290
One is the small business
innovation research grant

01:05:47.290 --> 01:05:49.630
program which was
the Alzheimer's

01:05:49.630 --> 01:05:51.860
and robotics grant
was under that,

01:05:51.860 --> 01:05:54.520
for fostering commercialization
of technologies

01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:55.820
through small businesses.

01:05:55.820 --> 01:05:57.600
It's a world leader.

01:05:57.600 --> 01:05:59.810
Many countries are
trying to adapt it

01:05:59.810 --> 01:06:02.080
to varying degrees of success.

01:06:02.080 --> 01:06:05.930
But a small company with an idea
or somebody with a prototype

01:06:05.930 --> 01:06:08.620
in an area of interest to the
government, there's quite a bit

01:06:08.620 --> 01:06:13.870
of funding both to develop
it to a trial and then

01:06:13.870 --> 01:06:15.530
to actually commercialize it.

01:06:15.530 --> 01:06:17.780
And another good, really
good thing we do, I think,

01:06:17.780 --> 01:06:20.650
from a research standpoint
is DARPA.

01:06:20.650 --> 01:06:21.950
We do many good things.

01:06:21.950 --> 01:06:23.430
But DARPA has been
very successful.

01:06:23.430 --> 01:06:28.770
So a lot of the autonomous
vehicles technologies today

01:06:28.770 --> 01:06:33.590
and around the world and here,
many companies working on it.

01:06:33.590 --> 01:06:36.080
It started at DARPA
only about 12 years ago

01:06:36.080 --> 01:06:41.680
with a DARPA Grand
Challenge for teams to come

01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:46.510
and develop an autonomous
vehicle that was able to drive

01:06:46.510 --> 01:06:50.530
through the Mojave Desert
for 108 miles along cliffs

01:06:50.530 --> 01:06:52.910
and over hills and
everything like that.

01:06:52.910 --> 01:06:55.410
In the first year, the
winning team [inaudible] went

01:06:55.410 --> 01:06:56.710
eight miles.

01:06:56.710 --> 01:07:00.920
And then all of them
had crashed by then.

01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:02.730
And so, just a number
of years later,

01:07:02.730 --> 01:07:07.770
this technology really
being adapted worldwide.

01:07:07.770 --> 01:07:11.620
And so the DARPA
idea was two-fold.

01:07:11.620 --> 01:07:15.190
But they had a lot, there
were a lot of initiatives

01:07:15.190 --> 01:07:17.540
on the different
elements of a car.

01:07:17.540 --> 01:07:21.300
But there weren't initiatives
to integrate them all together.

01:07:21.300 --> 01:07:25.770
And that the autonomous vehicles
back then weren't military grade

01:07:25.770 --> 01:07:28.060
and couldn't go 35
or 40 miles an hour.

01:07:28.060 --> 01:07:30.630
And their view was, there
weren't enough research teams

01:07:30.630 --> 01:07:34.300
or experts in the U.S. and
by developing this challenge,

01:07:34.300 --> 01:07:38.090
that they foster
interest in this

01:07:38.090 --> 01:07:40.370
and greatly increase the
number of research teams.

01:07:40.370 --> 01:07:45.240
And so, in more recent DARPA
challenges has been robotics the

01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:46.730
last several years.

01:07:46.730 --> 01:07:52.390
And so the first one, 2013
and '15, the robots were --

01:07:52.390 --> 01:07:54.000
they bounded it for robots

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.720
in natural disasters
like nuclear relief.

01:07:56.720 --> 01:08:01.270
But the first year that the
robots were very limited

01:08:01.270 --> 01:08:03.950
and couldn't go upstairs
or couldn't really do much.

01:08:03.950 --> 01:08:05.250
And just in a few years,

01:08:05.250 --> 01:08:08.340
a lot of the technology rapidly
advancing and cost is going

01:08:08.340 --> 01:08:11.570
to be coming down and much
more available to people.

01:08:11.570 --> 01:08:14.450
So with that, thank you
very much for coming.

01:08:14.450 --> 01:08:19.080
It's a fascinating area and
an ageing society has many,

01:08:19.080 --> 01:08:21.020
many needs and especially
with the intersection

01:08:21.020 --> 01:08:23.770
of ageing society
and disability.

01:08:23.770 --> 01:08:25.570
So thank you very much.

01:08:25.570 --> 01:08:31.040
[ Applause ]

01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:32.340
&gt;&gt; Sandra Charles:
Thank you for this.

01:08:32.340 --> 01:08:33.640
&gt;&gt; Jean-Pierre Auffret:
Oh, thank you.

01:08:33.640 --> 01:08:35.090
&gt;&gt; Sandra Charles: That was most
fascinating and informative.

01:08:35.090 --> 01:08:36.390
&gt;&gt; Jean-Pierre Auffret:
Oh, thank you.

01:08:36.390 --> 01:08:38.690
&gt;&gt; Sandra Charles: Are there
questions for Dr. Auffret?

01:08:43.150 --> 01:08:45.220
&gt;&gt; My name is [Inaudible].

01:08:45.220 --> 01:08:49.960
Thank you for [inaudible]
subject wide-ranging,

01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:56.160
still very concentrated,
interesting as well

01:08:56.160 --> 01:09:03.620
as educational insight
on the subject.

01:09:03.620 --> 01:09:05.850
Your presentation, very
[inaudible] to look

01:09:05.850 --> 01:09:09.410
at several other aspects.

01:09:09.410 --> 01:09:11.830
One of it then is
entrepreneurship.

01:09:11.830 --> 01:09:13.940
How entrepreneurship
could provide [inaudible]

01:09:13.940 --> 01:09:16.310
in this sense.

01:09:16.310 --> 01:09:23.750
We, my group [inaudible] work at
the sound [inaudible] last year.

01:09:23.750 --> 01:09:25.050
We were [inaudible].

01:09:25.050 --> 01:09:31.310
With regards to that, look

01:09:31.310 --> 01:09:39.310
at how the [inaudible]
could be entrepreneurial.

01:09:39.310 --> 01:09:42.930
It could be not [inaudible]
more opportunities.

01:09:42.930 --> 01:09:49.480
I just wonder how you look at
a [inaudible] rather than kind

01:09:49.480 --> 01:09:58.230
of the receiver of the
technology as a senior citizen.

01:10:01.110 --> 01:10:02.410
&gt;&gt; Jean-Pierre Auffret: Well,

01:10:02.410 --> 01:10:05.870
I think it's a very neat
question because I think of --

01:10:05.870 --> 01:10:07.170
&gt;&gt; Sandra Charles:
Could you [inaudible]?

01:10:07.170 --> 01:10:08.950
&gt;&gt; Jean-Pierre Auffret:
Oh, but the -- thank you.

01:10:08.950 --> 01:10:11.860
[Inaudible] that the question
is about the potential

01:10:11.860 --> 01:10:15.160
for senior entrepreneurs
developing technologies

01:10:15.160 --> 01:10:19.300
in addition to just being users.

01:10:19.300 --> 01:10:21.950
I think with increasing
life expectancies

01:10:21.950 --> 01:10:27.190
that many seniors
retire at 60 or 65 or 70

01:10:27.190 --> 01:10:29.680
and will live to 90 or 95.

01:10:29.680 --> 01:10:33.580
So they have years for a
full career ahead of them.

01:10:33.580 --> 01:10:37.920
And those that are able to
remain active and vibrant

01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:44.000
and healthy, really would also
benefit from an avenue or a path

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.160
and have a tremendous
amount to offer

01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:49.700
and a tremendous
amount of insight.

01:10:49.700 --> 01:10:54.570
So I think that there's many
senior entrepreneurs and I think

01:10:54.570 --> 01:10:56.510
that the potential
is really great.

01:10:56.510 --> 01:10:57.810
And they also would
bring insight

01:10:57.810 --> 01:10:59.270
to these types of technologies.

01:10:59.270 --> 01:11:04.630
But that the pensions
too, I think,

01:11:04.630 --> 01:11:07.780
in social security also
probably to some extent,

01:11:07.780 --> 01:11:11.610
what was designed when life
expectancies were much less

01:11:11.610 --> 01:11:13.060
than today.

01:11:13.060 --> 01:11:19.730
And so with seniors living,
population living so much

01:11:19.730 --> 01:11:24.760
to much greater ages, potential
for second and third careers.

01:11:24.760 --> 01:11:28.440
On one other note, I think it
does relate to the whole idea

01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:31.490
of careers is somewhat
different now.

01:11:31.490 --> 01:11:34.850
Much less of it in the U.S.
but many countries too,

01:11:34.850 --> 01:11:38.340
where someone works for one
company for many, many years

01:11:38.340 --> 01:11:41.670
and also with the way
technology changes so quickly.

01:11:41.670 --> 01:11:44.680
Industries seem to
come and go also.

01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:46.870
And so most people,
through the course

01:11:46.870 --> 01:11:50.040
of their lives even before 65,
have three or four careers.

01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:52.340
So a really excellent question.

01:11:55.510 --> 01:11:57.360
&gt;&gt; Sandra Charles: Any others?

01:11:57.360 --> 01:11:58.660
&gt;&gt; Jean-Pierre Auffret: Okay.

01:11:58.660 --> 01:11:59.960
Well, thank you all for coming.

01:11:59.960 --> 01:12:03.080
&gt;&gt; Sandra Charles: Thank you
very much again [applause].
