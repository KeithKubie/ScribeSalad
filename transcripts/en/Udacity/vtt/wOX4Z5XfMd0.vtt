00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.900
For the first fraction we'll have s squared for a numerator and 2 k s squared

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:08.340
for the denominator. For the second fraction we'll have k for a numerator and 2

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.622
k s squared for the denominator. And now we're ready to add these two fractions

00:00:12.622 --> 00:00:16.290
together. We add the numerators together, just like from before and then keep

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:20.178
the denominator the same. Be careful that you don't multiply these two numbers

00:00:20.178 --> 00:00:25.870
together. We really just have s squared plus k. We don't multiply them, since

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:26.793
we're adding.
