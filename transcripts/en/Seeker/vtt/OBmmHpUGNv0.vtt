00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:05.410
You've had a terrible week, you're stressed
out, sad, angry at the world.

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:09.840
If you're like a lot of people, you might
turn to food.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:16.590
Hey folks, Laci Green here for Dnews.

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.870
Emotional eating, or stressed eating, is basically
when you to feed a feeling instead of eating

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:22.970
to feed your tummy.

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.070
Everyone will do it at some point or another
but it's something that definitely affects

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.970
some people in more serious ways than others.

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:34.590
Common wisdom says that when we're stressed
out, we turn to comfort foods, fatty foods,

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.960
delicious-sweet-salty and not-so-good-for-your-body
foods.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.230
This week, a new study done at UCLA, is trying
to discount that idea.

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.690
The researchers took 59 MBA students and surveyed
them about their eating habits.

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.520
Then, during midterm exams, they offered them
a broad assortment a fine snacks to choose

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:52.520
from.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.469
Some are on the healthy side like fruit, yogurt
and wheat crackers.

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.220
Others were on the not so healthy side like
candy bars, chips and cookies.

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.480
They found that the snacks students picked
were the snack closest to what they usually

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.480
eat.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.990
Health-conscious students picked healthy snacks
and those with poor diets picked unhealthy

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.990
snacks.

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.119
The lead psychologist on this study, David
Neal, claims that when we're stressed out,

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:16.859
habits determine our food choices, not craving.

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:19.130
But I'm not so sure about that.

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.639
Something is a little fishy to me here, guys.

00:01:21.639 --> 00:01:25.479
This claim contradicts all the other research
on the topic and it's also worth mentioning

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:29.840
that the study was presented at a food technologist
conference and isn't a peer-reviewed.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.459
So Harvard Medical School claims that when
we're stressed out, we do gravitate toward

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:34.999
unhealthy foods.

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:39.969
Carbs and fat have the effect of activating
the reward centers in the brain and inhibiting

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:41.570
stress feedback.

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.590
It's a soft little, "SShh.

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.950
Here just feel good for a second."

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.200
And it works.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.029
The Journal of Physiology and Behavior found
that many people eat more and tend to more

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:54.529
caloricly dense foods when they're stressed
out.

00:01:54.529 --> 00:01:59.569
Possibly because of a pesky little hormone
called Ghrelin and that's released when you're

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:00.569
stressed.

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:02.509
This is one of the ways that stress can lead
to weight gain.

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:05.020
Why it's so hard to lose weight when you're
stressed.

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.689
And it also hints at a relationship between
obesity and stress levels.

00:02:09.689 --> 00:02:13.900
Some scientists have said that America's obesity
epidemic is actually a stress epidemic.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.830
So no, stress doesn't always lead to emotional
eating even in people who are emotional eaters.

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.370
Some people have the opposite reaction and
certainly in the short term, stress can kill

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:25.370
an appetite.

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.400
There is no stranger feeling and looking at
a delicious plate a food and being unable

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.689
to stomach it because you're so worried or
nervous about something.

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:37.640
This happens because stress at the fight-or-flight
nature can cause your hypothalamus produce

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.840
Corticotropin-releasing hormone, or CRH, which
suppresses appetite.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:48.190
It's more in the long term constant stress
that leads to overeating and the cravings.

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.370
So do eating habits play any role in our stressed
out food choices?

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.880
I'm sure they do, but that doesn't mean that
stress cravings aren't a thing.

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.260
