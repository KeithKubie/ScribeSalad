00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.140
Everything has a
location, whether it

00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:03.870
be the photos you
took, where you

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.162
are, the places you
like to hang out,

00:00:06.162 --> 00:00:07.620
where you bought
that special gift,

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.370
or even the last place
you met your date.

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:12.110
I'm Megan Boundey
Product Manager

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:14.380
for the Google Maps Mobile SDKs.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.230
Today I'm going to
show you some cool ways

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.090
to use Google Maps Mobile
SDKs, to help you both bring

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.460
these experiences alive, and
delight and engage your users.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.460
In this session, I'm focusing on
the Google Maps Android API v2.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.160
But all of this functionality
is available in the Google Maps

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.780
SDK for iOS as well.

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:33.610
This is great if you're looking
for cross-platform consistency

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:34.910
for your apps.

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.440
When developers think of
having a map in their app,

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.240
they often think of something
like this, a marker on a map.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.025
This is great for
showing you a location

00:00:43.025 --> 00:00:45.720
or marking out where you
might want to meet someone.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.320
But did you know that you could
add Street View to your app

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.070
like this?

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.320
Or make cool apps,
like Santa Tracker,

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.490
that follow Santa around the
world as he delivers presents?

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:56.620
Let's take a look.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.230
Our docs show you how to embed
a Google Map in an Android

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:00.440
activity.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.620
Then it's easy to add
markers to your map.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.230
You just use the
addMarker method

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.270
and specify a few options
to customize the Marker.

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.240
For example, you can set
latitude and longitude,

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.320
change the color of the Marker.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.860
You can also set what
shows up in the Info Window

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.350
when the user taps the Marker
and the Info Window pops up.

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.080
You may even want to use
photos as your Marker.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.480
Maybe you want to show where
the photo was taken on a map

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.480
and associate it with an
event, rather than just

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.240
showing a strip of
photos in your app.

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.070
Now that you've
seen Markers, let's

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.100
take a look at Street View.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.130
Most excitingly, you can
add Street View imagery

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:37.060
to your apps.

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.120
In this demo, you can
see the split screen

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.130
with the Street View
imagery in the top half,

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.020
and the Google Map
in the bottom half.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.910
By long pressing the
Marker and dragging,

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:46.710
Street View imagery
updates, and shows

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.540
you the location where
you dragged the Marker to.

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.010
So how do you do this?

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:54.070
A very similar demo is
available in the demo examples

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.570
in the Google Maps for
Android API v2 itself.

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.480
So the code is all there.

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.580
Here we've split the
layout into two parts.

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.970
There's one fragment for
the Street View panorama,

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.280
and one fragment
for the Google Map.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.950
You then set the
same initial location

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.960
for the map, the Marker,
and the panorama.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.470
And we've given our Marker a
custom icon, which is Pegman.

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.890
When you drag the Marker,
you listen to a drag event

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.390
from the Marker and
use the callback

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.970
to position the location
of the panorama.

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.090
When the panorama
change event occurs,

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.100
the listener will give
you the precise location

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.980
of the panorama, and you can
feed this back to the Marker

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.050
to update its position
completely accurately.

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.180
So what else can you
do with Street View?

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.830
You may want to add Street
View to your Store Locator,

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.870
see an area around a hotel, or
view a museum or an aquarium.

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.620
Street View also provides
you with seamless access

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.940
to Google's Indoor
Street View imagery.

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.750
You can set the
Street View panorama

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.130
to be of imagery
within the aquarium,

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.670
or set it outside the aquarium,
and have your users navigate

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.309
inside if they wish.

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:53.850
Of course, you can
do this for stores

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.585
as well, if the store has
indoor business view imagery.

00:02:56.585 --> 00:02:58.460
This would be awesome
if you're a store owner

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:00.600
and you want your customers
to see what's available

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.030
inside to entice them
to come and visit you.

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.160
Moving on.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.760
How can you make
your users feel more

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.174
immersed in their
Maps experience?

00:03:09.174 --> 00:03:10.840
Have you tried out
the Santa Tracker app

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.375
and wondered why it felt so
movie-like to follow Santa

00:03:13.375 --> 00:03:15.920
as he flies around the world?

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.010
This is because we made the
camera track Santa's location.

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.770
Both the Google Maps
Mobile SDKs use a camera

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:24.480
that lets you set the location
of what you want to look at.

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.915
You can animate the camera
by using a camera update

00:03:26.915 --> 00:03:29.380
and calling the
animateCamera method.

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.100
This is where you can also set
the zoom level, the bearing,

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.480
the tilt, and the
duration of the animation.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.140
It's so effective.

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.070
If you don't want to
see any animation,

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.280
you just call the
moveCamera method instead,

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.550
and it will move the map
directly to that new location.

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:45.950
We have a whole session
dedicated to the Santa Tracker

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.290
app at Google I/O 2014.

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.190
So make sure to take a look.

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:51.730
Now you know how
to make your users

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.870
feel more immersed in
their Maps experience,

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.440
how do you add things to
the map and animate them?

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.690
For example, how do
those weather apps

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.170
get their clouds coming
in over the terrain map?

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.230
Google Maps has several
map types available,

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.800
such as satellite,
hybrid, or terrain.

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.260
It's really easy to
switch between map types.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.610
You just use the setMapType
method on the map

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:13.920
and specify the map
type that you want.

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.970
These apps are also using
mostly transparent tile overlays

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.180
with the clouds as
the opaque features.

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.959
Tile overlays allow you to
specify particular tiles

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.120
to be shown at a given
set of coordinates.

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.990
You should also
specify which tiles

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:27.720
can be shown at each zoom level.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.330
All you need to do is to
find a urlTileProvider

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.410
and supply that to the
TileOverlay options.

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:33.780
Then add it to the map.

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.706
To make their clouds
appear to be moving,

00:04:35.706 --> 00:04:37.080
the weather apps
are swapping out

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.170
multiple tile
overlays periodically

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:41.070
to make it appear animated.

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:44.480
Talking about the weather,
it may be time to go inside.

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.640
There's also the ability
to see indoor maps along

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.930
with with [? perkomatic ?]
control of the indoor level

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.384
of a building and
the floor picker.

00:04:51.384 --> 00:04:52.800
You can find out
which building is

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.605
active by calling
getFocusedBuilding,

00:04:54.605 --> 00:04:56.730
and then find out the active
level of that building

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:58.696
by calling getActiveLevelIndex.

00:04:58.696 --> 00:05:00.070
This is great if
you want to show

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:01.720
Custom Markup for
the Active Level,

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.920
such as markers,
poly lines, tile

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:05.340
overlays, and other shapes.

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:07.950
You can also turn off
our default Level Picker

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:10.640
and implement your own by
passing false to the method

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:14.490
setIndoorLevelPickerEnabled
and then adding your own.

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:17.560
Now we've seen all parts of
the world via our map-- indoor,

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.630
outdoor, Street View, a
normal [INAUDIBLE] map,

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:21.310
and weather overlays.

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:24.100
Who knew you could so much
with Maps in your apps?

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.055
To get started mapping up your
own apps, go here for Android

00:05:27.055 --> 00:05:28.610
and here for iOS.

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:30.900
And if you need any
help, our Support Page

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:33.160
lists the stackover
Play tags that you need.

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:34.890
So what are you waiting for?

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:38.770
It's time to get out there and
start mapping up your apps.
