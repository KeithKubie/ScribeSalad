00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.969
So if the BRCA1 mutation is dominant, then why don't all

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:06.090
women with this mutation get breast cancer? Because I mean, didn't

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.000
we learn in lesson 5 that if a person heterozygous for

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
a dominant gene then they will in fact be affected by it?

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.360
&gt;&gt; That is exactly what we learned in lesson 5. And

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.370
that's not the case here because. The complex world of complex

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:22.180
traits, is complex. Right? Some alleles, it turns out, don't always

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.560
cause a phenotype because they're not what we call fully penetrant.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.815
&gt;&gt; So you're saying if you have a

00:00:27.815 --> 00:00:29.950
disease-causing allele, you might not actually have that disease?

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.070
&gt;&gt; Exactly. That's exactly what penetrance is. Penetrance

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.750
is the degree to which an allele causes

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.230
a given trait. There are lots of examples

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.800
of dominant traits that aren't actually fully penetrant.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.880
&gt;&gt; How does that happen?

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.400
&gt;&gt; Well, it's complicated, as you can imagine. And it's

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.780
usually because there are multiple genes controlling any given trait.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.000
And although one allele of one of those genes

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.580
could have a noticeable impact on the trait. We

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.760
may or may not see it depending on what

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.800
the alleles are for all of the other genes.

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.500
&gt;&gt; Well, how do we figure out what all these other alleles are?

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.970
&gt;&gt; Well, research. Long, laborious research. For

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.020
example, some research has shown us that the

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.660
risk for breast cancer jumps to 60% if

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.548
you have some types of these BRCA1 mutation.

00:01:15.548 --> 00:01:20.510
So, do 60% of women who have breast cancer have this mutation?

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.390
&gt;&gt; That's a really good question. But, the

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.500
answer's actually no. In fact, very few women who

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.360
have breast cancer actually have these mutations. If we

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.660
look back at our original graph of breast cancer

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:35.900
risk where the average was 12%. Notice that a risk of 60% is way to the right of

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.270
that, and only a few women have that risk,

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.960
also implying that even fewer women have this particular

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.810
mutation, because it's not the only contributor to breast cancer. In

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.790
fact, the prevalence of BRCA1 mutations

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.770
varies in different ethnic populations of

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.690
the world. But in the United States, for the general population

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.930
the prevalence of BRCA1 mutations affects less than 1% of the population.
