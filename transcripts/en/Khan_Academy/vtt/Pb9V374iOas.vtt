00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:04.859
We're asked to simplify log
base 5 of x to the third.

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:06.650
And once again, we're
just going to rewrite

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:08.010
this in a different way.

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.020
You could argue whether it's
going to be more simple or not.

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:13.740
And the logarithm
property that I'm

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.230
guessing that we should use
for this example right here

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:24.420
is the property-- if I take
log base x of-- let me pick

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.600
some more letters here, log
base x of y to the zth power.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:36.860
This is the same thing as
z times log base x of y.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:38.380
So this is a logarithm property.

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.080
If I'm taking the logarithm
of a given base of something

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:46.040
to a power, I could take
that power out front

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.570
and multiply that times
the log of the base,

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.100
of just the y in this case.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.770
So we apply this
property over here.

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.690
And in a second, once
I do this problem,

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.610
we'll talk about why this
actually makes a lot of sense

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.160
and comes straight out
of exponent properties.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.700
But if we just apply
that over here,

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.309
we get log base 5
of x to the third.

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.100
Well, this is the
exponent right over here.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.040
That's the same thing as z.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.610
So that's going to
be the same thing

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.620
as-- let me do this
in a different color--

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.161
that 3 is the same thing-- we
could put it out front-- that's

00:01:15.161 --> 00:01:21.315
the same thing as 3 times
the logarithm base 5 of x.

00:01:21.315 --> 00:01:21.940
And we're done.

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.398
This is just another way of
writing it using this property.

00:01:24.398 --> 00:01:27.100
And so you could argue that
this is a what-- maybe this

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.750
is a simplification
because you took

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.940
the exponent outside
of the logarithm,

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.122
and you're multiplying the
logarithm by that number now.

00:01:34.122 --> 00:01:35.830
Now with that out of
the way, let's think

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.540
about why that
actually makes sense.

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:43.700
So let's say that we
know that-- and I'll just

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.210
pick some arbitrary
letters here--

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.456
let's say that we know that a
to the b power is equal to c.

00:01:50.456 --> 00:01:52.080
And so if we know
that-- that's written

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.500
as an exponential equation.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.450
If we wanted to
write the same truth

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:02.290
as a logarithmic equation, we
would say logarithm base a of c

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:03.750
is equal to b.

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.280
To what power do I have
to raise a to get c?

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.120
I raise it to the bth power.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.830
a to the b power is equal to c.

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.060
Fair enough.

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.950
Now let's take both sides of
this equation right over here,

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.220
and raise it to the dth power.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.280
So let me make it--
so let's raise--

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.150
take both sides of this equation
and raise it to the dth power.

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.110
Instead of doing
it in place, I'm

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.670
just going to
rewrite it over here.

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.503
So I wrote the original
equation, a to the b

00:02:26.503 --> 00:02:29.490
is equal to c, which is just
rewriting this statement.

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.540
But let me take both sides
of this to the dth power.

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:34.810
And I should be consistent.

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.400
I'll use all capital letters.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.780
So this should be a
B. Actually, let's

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.480
say I'm using all
lowercase letters.

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.010
This is a lowercase c.

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.300
So let me write it
this way, a to the-- so

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.536
I'm going to raise
this to the dth power,

00:02:48.536 --> 00:02:50.410
and I'm going to raise
this to the dth power.

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.390
Obviously, if these two things
are equal to each other,

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.360
if I raise both sides
to the same power,

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.520
the equality is
still going to hold.

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.760
Now, what's
interesting over here

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.360
is we can now say--
what we could do

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.437
is we can use what we know
about exponent properties.

00:03:07.437 --> 00:03:09.020
Say, look, if I have
a to the b power,

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.050
and then I raise
that to the d power,

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.340
our exponent properties say
that this is the same thing.

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:22.060
This is equal to
a to the bd power.

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.965
This is equal to a to the bd.

00:03:23.965 --> 00:03:24.840
Let me write it here.

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.830
This is-- let me do that
in a different color.

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:28.720
I've already used that green.

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.270
This right over
here, using what we

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:32.770
know about exponent
properties, this

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.640
is the same thing as
a to the bd power.

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:40.660
So we have a to the bd power
is equal to c to the dth power.

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.995
And now this
exponential equation,

00:03:42.995 --> 00:03:45.900
if we would write it as
a logarithmic equation,

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:58.810
we would say log base a of c to
the dth power is equal to bd.

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.760
What power do I have to raise
a to get to c to the dth power?

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:03.680
To get to this?

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.810
I have to raise it
to the bd power.

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:07.620
But what do we know that b is?

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.000
We already know that b is
this thing right over here.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.020
So if we substitute
this in for b,

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:19.180
and we can rewrite
this as db, we

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:25.670
get logarithm base a of c to
the dth power is equal to bd,

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:29.130
or you could also call that
db, if you switch the order.

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.476
And so that's
equal to d times b.

00:04:32.476 --> 00:04:38.590
b is just log base a of c.

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:39.500
So there you have it.

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:40.830
We just derived this property.

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.840
Log base a of c
to the dth, that's

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.300
the same thing as
d times log base a

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.860
of c, which we applied
right over here.
