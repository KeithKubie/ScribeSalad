00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.210
So that was surprising to me,
that was not where I originally went.

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.656
I didn't see the two thirds popping out
because really like you said there's no

00:00:06.656 --> 00:00:07.689
where's the thirds.

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:10.240
There's nothing in the set up of
the problem that had thirds in it.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.250
&gt;&gt; Right and so the way that I come to
that answer is I think about counting.

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.880
So before when I said well if
I know there's only one and

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.270
you tell me that one.

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:21.911
The x is actually right, that's a one.

00:00:21.911 --> 00:00:25.844
It's like also telling me,
y is not it, and z is not it.

00:00:25.844 --> 00:00:31.456
And kind of the intuition here is that
if the probability of human correct

00:00:31.456 --> 00:00:36.793
is 0.8, it's almost like I'm
giving eight-tenths of a count.

00:00:36.793 --> 00:00:40.419
That's like saying that you
got eight tenths of an x,

00:00:40.419 --> 00:00:44.689
of a count going towards x and
then 0.2 for y and 0.2 for z,

00:00:44.689 --> 00:00:48.316
which you'll notice that
if you normalize that out,

00:00:48.316 --> 00:00:52.820
works out exactly to be two
thirds one sixth and one sixth.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.720
&gt;&gt; Yeah so that counting thing
turns out to be very powerful and

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.420
we can derive a more
general version of this.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:00.778
So this quiz is actually,

00:01:00.778 --> 00:01:03.938
both of the quiz I gave you were
actually designed to be easy.

00:01:03.938 --> 00:01:04.536
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Yeah and

00:01:04.536 --> 00:01:05.600
do you know what makes them easy?

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.120
What makes them easy is that we
only had one, one piece of data.

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.700
You see you try to take
action x in state s and

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.860
you ended up being told that was good.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.310
But what if you had done it ten or

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.970
twenty times and sometimes x was said
to be good, sometimes said to be bad,

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.730
sometimes y was said to be good,
sometimes said to be bad.

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:26.128
Then this kind of natural, this sort of
process you went through still works but

00:01:26.128 --> 00:01:28.003
you have to keep track
of a lot more things and

00:01:28.003 --> 00:01:29.793
this counting argument actually helps.

00:01:29.793 --> 00:01:33.873
And it comes from exactly
the crystal clear generative model

00:01:33.873 --> 00:01:36.760
that uses Bayes rule
that you came up with.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.280
So I'm going to actually
write it down for

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.380
you and we can talk about it for
a little bit, okay.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.950
&gt;&gt; Yeah no I'd like to
see the general form.
