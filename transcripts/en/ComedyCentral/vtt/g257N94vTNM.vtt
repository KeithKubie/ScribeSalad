00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:02.970
An Australian teenager
has filed a lawsuit

00:00:03.003 --> 00:00:05.539
against several publications
thanks to this image.

00:00:05.572 --> 00:00:08.408
The lawsuit claims that ever
since this photo's publication,

00:00:08.442 --> 00:00:10.844
the plaintiff has been
relentlessly memed

00:00:10.878 --> 00:00:13.547
because
of his luxuriant haircut.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.117
That's all business
in the front, party in the back,

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.319
Staten Island garbage man
on top,

00:00:19.353 --> 00:00:23.790
and medieval monk with leukemia
on the sides.

00:00:23.824 --> 00:00:28.028
-(cheers and applause)
-Uh...

00:00:31.098 --> 00:00:35.035
â™ª Leukemia monk.

00:00:35.068 --> 00:00:37.404
The lawsuit specifically
mentions this image,

00:00:37.437 --> 00:00:39.506
of someone trying
to pin the mullet on the donkey.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.810
(laughter)

00:00:43.844 --> 00:00:45.479
(cheers and applause)

00:00:45.512 --> 00:00:47.648
But I have to say,
this one's my favorite.

00:00:47.681 --> 00:00:49.716
This is where he looks like...

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.586
(laughter, applause)

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:55.556
This...

00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:58.759
This looks like he's about to DJ
a dubstep rave at the Alamo.

00:00:58.792 --> 00:01:00.260
(laughter)

00:01:00.294 --> 00:01:02.796
But one of the defendants
fired back, quote,

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:04.264
"By reason
of his mullet hairstyle,

00:01:04.298 --> 00:01:07.067
the plaintiff has justifiably
exposed himself to ridicule,"

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.837
and, quote, "The plaintiff
is a ridiculous person."

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:13.674
-(laughter)
-Uh... either way...

00:01:13.707 --> 00:01:15.776
Sustained.

00:01:15.809 --> 00:01:17.244
I'll allow it.

00:01:17.277 --> 00:01:19.479
Either way, this landmark case
could open the floodgates

00:01:19.513 --> 00:01:22.115
for other memes to sue,
so, comedians, what's another

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:24.551
Internet celebrity
who might seek legal recourse,

00:01:24.585 --> 00:01:27.855
and what are they suing for?
Nico.

00:01:27.888 --> 00:01:30.357
That cop is suing for what those
two awful girls did to him.

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.025
-Yeah, all right, points.
-(laughter, applause)

00:01:32.059 --> 00:01:34.027
Yeah. Colton.

00:01:34.061 --> 00:01:36.663
The "Chocolate Rain" guy is
suing the Weather Channel

00:01:36.697 --> 00:01:39.199
for classifying "Chocolate Rain"
as climate change.

00:01:39.233 --> 00:01:42.503
-HARDWICK: All right, points.
Points. -(laughter, applause)

00:01:42.536 --> 00:01:44.872
-Lauren. -Grumpy Cat is gonna
sue for defamation,

00:01:44.905 --> 00:01:46.406
because that cat is not grumpy.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.908
She's just got
resting bitch face.

00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:49.142
HARDWICK:
Yeah. Points.

00:01:49.176 --> 00:01:51.044
-(applause and cheering)
-Points. She really does.

00:01:51.078 --> 00:01:51.144
She really does.
