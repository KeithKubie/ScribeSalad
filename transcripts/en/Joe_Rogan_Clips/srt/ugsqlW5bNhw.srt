1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,140
That. I'm a fan of that one.
I'm not a fan of investment.

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:03,750
What I have a question about is,

3
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:07,650
is there a some buddy in charge of what,

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:11,670
what's permissible and what's
not according to a certain
code of conduct and do

5
00:00:11,671 --> 00:00:13,590
they have a political
agenda? So in other words,

6
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:17,760
so if I put out something
that has profanity or maybe
I'll stand up clip where I

7
00:00:17,761 --> 00:00:18,780
want to get people in, it's,

8
00:00:18,781 --> 00:00:22,740
it's a clip that is offensive to said
person touched possibilities. Yeah,

9
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:27,870
they can go, Nope, we're stopping them
from doing that. But see with the,

10
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,150
with the dudes with their
shirts off flex and shit,

11
00:00:30,151 --> 00:00:33,810
when they're trying to get clients,
that's fine. And they can promote,

12
00:00:33,811 --> 00:00:36,750
reach other people outside their
followers is what it should be.

13
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:38,580
But if you have 100,000 followers,

14
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:42,690
it should reach all 100,000 then
that's what's crazy to me. Yeah.

15
00:00:42,691 --> 00:00:45,150
They're going to lose everybody.
There's going to be a new Instagram.

16
00:00:45,151 --> 00:00:47,880
If they started doing that shit and it
gets out of hand, people just leave.

17
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,880
Well there's, you know, it's
shadow banning is right. No,

18
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:55,440
there's a concept of shadow banning and
I don't know if this is Jamie would be

19
00:00:55,441 --> 00:00:56,700
able to speak to this better than me.

20
00:00:56,701 --> 00:00:59,910
Is that ever been proved that they
actually do shadow banned people?

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,070
What's that? Or is that it's they

22
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:08,970
[inaudible] is that if you say we're on
Twitter and maybe you were conservative

23
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:14,480
and you said a lot of rude things about
liberals that maybe they would decide

24
00:01:14,701 --> 00:01:17,700
that although it doesn't violate the
terms of service, what you do is, uh,

25
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:18,960
makes them uncomfortable.

26
00:01:18,961 --> 00:01:23,070
They make a moral judgment and they
decide to limit your engagement talking

27
00:01:23,071 --> 00:01:26,610
about, yeah, this is somehow
possible. This is possible.

28
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:28,500
But is that like a hater?

29
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,220
It's all in what you're saying
with the paying of of post two.

30
00:01:32,221 --> 00:01:36,930
It happens similarly there too. If
you were an account that never paid.

31
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:40,600
Yeah. And once you pay, once
you give him five bucks, you're,

32
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:44,370
you're like flag now as an account that
will pay and change your engagement.

33
00:01:44,371 --> 00:01:47,040
Twitter, it's Twitter. You
don't across the board. Yeah.

34
00:01:47,041 --> 00:01:49,740
You can pay on Twitter too. How do you
pay on Twitter? Do you pay on Twitter?

35
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:54,330
You don't have to, but there's an
option. You can pay promoted tweets.

36
00:01:54,331 --> 00:01:55,970
It's a promoted tweet.

37
00:01:55,971 --> 00:01:59,340
The top trending topic for the
last year or two is a paid,

38
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:01,920
it says paid or promoted. Really? Yeah.

39
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:04,560
You just had to go into it
because they get money now.

40
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:09,240
That's how they're called. Who's been
banned from Twitter? A lot of people, man,

41
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:15,230
he fucking is the most famous [inaudible]
Benjamin's been banned from Twitter.

42
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:19,970
He has and more conservatives are
conservatives, but liberals I've been to,

43
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:22,730
there's liberals that have put out
death threats. They'd been banned,

44
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:27,500
but in general they should be lopsided.

45
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:30,410
I don't know. That's a good question.
We should find out what is the,

46
00:02:30,411 --> 00:02:34,700
what is the press should be banned being
banned. That's a good question too.

47
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:39,350
Is it to incite violence or is it
the violate the terms of service and

48
00:02:39,351 --> 00:02:41,810
definitely if you incite
violence, that's definitely a no,

49
00:02:41,811 --> 00:02:45,860
no racial slurs or no-no racist.

50
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:50,390
You can call someone a fuckhead.
You can call someone a fuck head,

51
00:02:50,391 --> 00:02:55,280
but you can't call him like a
Guinea fuck head. There's like,

52
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:58,160
there's certain things you can say
and certain things you can't say,

53
00:02:58,161 --> 00:03:01,660
but it's a lot of it's, yeah. But then
some of it's pretty black and white.

54
00:03:01,661 --> 00:03:04,840
Like if you're like, man, I want to
go socia blow up that fucking school.

55
00:03:04,841 --> 00:03:09,130
Fuck those kids. Of course, the
racist stuff. Yeah. Yes. All of that.

56
00:03:09,131 --> 00:03:10,570
I think you gotta regulate the hate too.

57
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:14,740
If it's just bullying and shit like
that. We just ban them. Well, it's like,

58
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,960
here's the question and this
is who gets to decide who,

59
00:03:19,961 --> 00:03:21,310
what's hateful and what's not.

60
00:03:21,311 --> 00:03:24,010
And then the problem is they keep pushing
it further and further and further and

61
00:03:24,011 --> 00:03:28,960
then even just insults or hateful,
even even like this guy is a dumb ass.

62
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:32,380
Yeah. That's hateful. Saying
someone's a dumb ass. It's hateful.

63
00:03:32,381 --> 00:03:36,340
I mean they're going to,
there's only so far you can,

64
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:39,520
you could keep going
down that road. Right?

65
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:42,520
You want to make sure that you have
free expression and you don't get free

66
00:03:42,521 --> 00:03:43,354
expression.

67
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:48,970
If you ban people from saying things
that just don't seem that bad to me.

68
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:52,840
Well, I mean Alex Jones, you think a
Hispanic, I'd like to see what he says.

69
00:03:52,841 --> 00:03:56,350
Sandy hook stuff. Sandy. But see, but
here's the thing. Getting sued for that.

70
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:58,540
Anyway, here's the thing. Yeah. He
was already getting sued for that.

71
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:00,520
Like what did he say that got him?

72
00:04:00,521 --> 00:04:04,990
I think something happened that he did
had nothing to do with even what he said.

73
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:07,930
He confronted them at some events. Right?

74
00:04:07,931 --> 00:04:12,931
And he was yelling in the back and that
happened after he confronted people in

75
00:04:12,971 --> 00:04:15,420
Congress. Well, he's got a,

76
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:20,380
Alex Jones has a regular
on a former CIA officer,

77
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:24,250
dr Steve [inaudible]. He has him
on like once every six months.

78
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:27,400
That's where he got the Sandy
hook information was from him.

79
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:31,120
That dude is on video as a
CIA guy know about Sandy hook.

80
00:04:31,121 --> 00:04:35,170
The fuck would he know that's a dumbest
fucking thing that Alex Jones has ever

81
00:04:35,171 --> 00:04:37,990
done. It's also a moral, and
there's parents who said,

82
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:41,620
fuck dr Steve [inaudible],
second guy fucks whatever.

83
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:43,830
If he said it didn't
fuck [inaudible] yeah.

84
00:04:43,831 --> 00:04:46,950
You have to always wonder
and you would you, I mean,

85
00:04:46,951 --> 00:04:48,720
I'm not making any accusations,

86
00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:51,000
but you'd have to always wonder
when you hear a story like that,

87
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,970
why would someone say
something so ridiculous?

88
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:58,950
And why would someone try to convince
someone like Alex Jones of something so

89
00:04:58,951 --> 00:05:03,090
ridiculous? And I think there'd be
two reasons. One to discredit Jones.

90
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:06,540
If you could talk him into
repeating what you said,

91
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,610
if you think he's willing
to do, that's interesting.

92
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:12,420
You can easily discredit him and it
would be a really good way to do it.

93
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:14,930
Like the best way to do it. Okay.
Do you know what I'm saying?

94
00:05:14,931 --> 00:05:17,600
Whether he's right or wrong,
whether he's right or wrong,

95
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,530
doctors deep paternics said it
several times on the show, so,

96
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:26,060
but he's not Alex for Alex to believe
him. No, it started like this,

97
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:26,901
that crazy Eddie,

98
00:05:26,901 --> 00:05:29,420
he's hearing it from a guy who
was in the CIA started like this.

99
00:05:29,421 --> 00:05:32,570
It started out crazy for him to
believe in a guy from, you know,

100
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:36,640
he may or may not be right, but it
started with Alex actually saying, uh, uh,

101
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,580
he said, unfortunately he goes
something to the effect of I saw it,

102
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:43,010
it was very sad. And then,

103
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:47,090
but unfortunately I've seen a lot of
soap operas and I've seen a lot of and,

104
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:47,421
and,

105
00:05:47,421 --> 00:05:52,421
and I know an actor when I see one and
that's where it started with him and he's

106
00:05:52,911 --> 00:05:56,980
being, you know, he's being sued
by Connecticut. He's in trouble,

107
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:57,980
be a good acting coach.

108
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,370
But remember he knows an actor
[inaudible] in court and they said,

109
00:06:01,371 --> 00:06:03,650
what the fuck? Basically what the
fuck are you doing? He goes, listen,

110
00:06:03,651 --> 00:06:06,380
I say a lot of things just
for entertaining of course.

111
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:09,230
Like it's just for the during,
is that his trial with his wife?

112
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:13,220
He did admit, he's like,
I don't believe it.

113
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:16,160
A lot of that I just say
he's got a business. Yeah.

114
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:19,130
Well that's the thing about
all a lot of nutrition people,

115
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:22,730
a lot of these people is you make
money. You make money in this,

116
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:25,130
in this business. And
whether, whatever it is,

117
00:06:25,131 --> 00:06:26,900
whether it's being a political pundit,

118
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:31,730
whether it's being attainment
or an exercise guy, you
make money having answers.

119
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,850
If you're somebody who's more scientific
and says, I dunno, it depends.

120
00:06:34,851 --> 00:06:38,660
Maybe you're not going to make money.
When you say bone broth cures cancer,

121
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:41,240
you're going to sell
books. When you say, uh,

122
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:45,860
my plant based diet is proven to
do blah, blah, blah, whatever,

123
00:06:45,861 --> 00:06:47,870
you're going to make money.
If you say, I'm going to,

124
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:51,950
I'll help you lose weight and keep
it off in four month, take my money.

125
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:55,520
You're not going to say,
Hey, I'm a nutritionist guy.

126
00:06:55,521 --> 00:06:57,740
It's going to take you two years.
We're going to try to change it.

127
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,380
If you gonna have bounce backs, you're
gonna have plateaus and being realistic.

128
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:01,520
Yeah, nobody's going to buy that shit.

129
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:06,530
This you Dawn guy has gotten a
movement man. So, but with, uh,

130
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:11,690
with Alex Jones, is he banned for life
or I don't know how a business, well,

131
00:07:11,691 --> 00:07:12,800
I mean, he still has his website.

132
00:07:12,801 --> 00:07:14,750
He's got a big lawsuit
he's got to worry about,

133
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:18,800
but it shows they got rid of his show
happen all the farmers and shit. No,

134
00:07:18,801 --> 00:07:22,070
the only thing that happened is they
pulled him off of YouTube and they pulled

135
00:07:22,071 --> 00:07:27,071
him off at Twitter and Facebook to an
iTunes and he's got a major lawsuit with a

136
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:31,610
law firm that doesn't compromise.
There's tears. There's two guys,

137
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:36,320
there's two guys that are being sued over
that. Uh, Alex Jones and a guy named,

138
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,490
uh, Wolf gang Helbig. He's
also, he's also being sued.

139
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:45,960
That guy, his job was to
prepare schools for, uh,

140
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:50,120
school shootings. So he came out and
he started saying that too. So he's,

141
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:54,740
he's breaking apart. He started
saying that San Diego, he's getting,

142
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:58,070
he's getting sued along with
Alex Jones. Oh my God. Well,

143
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,090
but they didn't show up for when you
went to court. They'd never showed up.

144
00:08:02,091 --> 00:08:05,060
So they dropped the case. What
about one thing about that law law?

145
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:06,660
It's kind of weird now
that they're, they have,

146
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:13,280
why would Sandy hook be fake? Let's not
talk about this stuff. Oh, I don't know.

147
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:17,120
I find it fascinating. Well, like why
in the world would it be fake though be,

148
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:19,070
I know you get rid up like
what's the conspiracy?

149
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:22,640
Zero zero thoughts that that is fake.

150
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:26,150
But I do have thoughts on why someone
would try to get other people to say it's

151
00:08:26,151 --> 00:08:29,540
fake. And this if there's any,

152
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:33,320
if there's anything that's ever going
to convince you that conspiracy theories

153
00:08:33,321 --> 00:08:37,640
are stupid, it's making
up a fake conspiracy,

154
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:43,200
an easily provable fake conspiracy
about a real tragedy. That's a nice,

155
00:08:43,201 --> 00:08:45,470
simple psychological
way to discredit people.

156
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:48,110
If I thought you were a dumb
ass but you had a big voice,

157
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:53,350
I might talk you into saying some shit
about something that's not real and have

158
00:08:53,361 --> 00:08:56,280
you convinced it's real. So you spout
it out, you look like a moron, right?

159
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:58,180
And that discredits
everything else you said.

160
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,690
And you have to be really careful
with a lot of these stories.

161
00:09:00,691 --> 00:09:01,500
There's a lot of these,

162
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,860
these conspiracy theories that
literally start out a joke.

163
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:09,690
They start out in four Chan and a lot
of these chat rooms as trolls and then

164
00:09:09,691 --> 00:09:10,501
before you know it,

165
00:09:10,501 --> 00:09:14,010
it becomes a real thing that's said
over and over and so said over and over

166
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:17,910
again and then morons get ahold
of. But [inaudible] true, right?

167
00:09:17,911 --> 00:09:20,640
Like he's a smart, we can all
agree he's a, I don't agree.

168
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,490
What do you mean you don't think he's,
I don't know to do what he's doing.

169
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:28,200
Listen, I don't ever talk
about stuff [inaudible] no, no.

170
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:32,730
You would not say he's a dumb person.
I don't know. I, I can't speak.

171
00:09:32,731 --> 00:09:35,340
Pretty articulate. Yeah. He's
not stupid. Like I'm very,

172
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:39,270
very sad that he said that Sandy
hook isn't real. I fuck with him.

173
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,310
But I always enjoy being around that guy.

174
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:44,610
You would say he's articulate smart
guy. Right? He's a fun guy too. Yeah.

175
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,350
So I'm just saying for him to,

176
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:49,230
it's not like you can just honey
Dick and be like, dude, Sandy hook.

177
00:09:49,231 --> 00:09:53,130
Like it would have to be something.
He loves conspiracies, man. You know,

178
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,180
he really does.

179
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:58,230
And this is the problem with someone
who likes hunts out conspiracies.

180
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:01,560
You're going to love them, you're
going to, you're gonna look for them.

181
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:05,280
[inaudible] numerology and the
Bible. You can find any pattern.

182
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:09,390
This is the problem is when you have
a vested interest in them being real,

183
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,320
when it's your business, because
there are a lot of them that are real.

184
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:17,400
So the problem is if you have a vested
interest in them being real and you

185
00:10:17,401 --> 00:10:21,540
exclude information that would point
to them not being real and you use

186
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:25,830
confirmation bias and you fuck up and
then you try to convince other people that

187
00:10:25,831 --> 00:10:28,380
you're correct. This is
something that people will fall.

188
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:32,760
[inaudible] I'd love to hear you on.
You're super quiet about all this,

189
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:36,600
but if you're a conspiracy theory,
which ones have been proven correct?

190
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:41,640
That many, right? There's plenty.
Absolutely. There's big ones like Enron,

191
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,820
you know, there's big ones. There's
big ones. You know, there's uh,

192
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:48,300
many documentaries and books have
been written on the Enron conspiracy.

193
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,960
These guys got together and they figured
out how to make a kajillion dollars and

194
00:10:51,961 --> 00:10:53,970
fuck people over. And it was a, it was,

195
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,390
it was breaking the law and
they knew it was breaking law.

196
00:10:57,391 --> 00:11:01,200
They conspire to do it and by names
and phone so you can take, take them.

197
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:05,430
There's wise people to think the 2008
hires, housing crisis, that that was the,

198
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:09,510
that was all on purpose. These guys built
this bubble up and it's proven though.

199
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:13,470
It's not proven. It's not
proven. The housing bubble was,

200
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,900
there've been great books written
on it by Michael Lewis, his book,

201
00:11:15,901 --> 00:11:19,350
the big shorts, a good book
on it. But they, you know,

202
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,470
there's been a lot of research on that.
Too many bank. Is there any proven ones?

203
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:27,820
But it all, it all depends. Bread
and despise again. No, no, no, no,

204
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:32,130
no. And he knows his shit. It all depends
on how much circumstantial evidence

205
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:35,550
makes you throw up some red flags.

206
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:38,340
Like some people they just don't
see the red flags and some people,

207
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,190
their red flags go up right
away. So it all depends.

208
00:11:41,191 --> 00:11:45,780
Like when you say is there any
proof? Well, um, you don't need,

209
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,740
uh, I mean at,

210
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:53,130
at a certain point when you
have circumstantial evidence,

211
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:56,110
at a certain point it adds
up. You know, you know,

212
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,360
if I'm one of case,

213
00:11:58,361 --> 00:12:01,870
pretty suspect JFK suspect is super,

214
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:04,720
there's no look Jeff K's a
perfect example, right? Yeah.

215
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:09,430
There's no actual proof of the
conspiracy that there was a, you know,

216
00:12:09,431 --> 00:12:14,410
multiple shooters or the CIA and
the mob. There's no actual proof.

217
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:17,950
But there's a lot of circumstantial
evidence. Well not all depends on,

218
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:22,390
it all depends on how much circumstantial
evidence do you need for any

219
00:12:22,391 --> 00:12:25,210
particular conspiracy theory
where you go, Oh shit,

220
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:28,360
there's enough circumstantial evidence.
Like if there was a murder, right,

221
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:31,540
and you were being accused and
only one person said, you know,

222
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:35,020
I saw Brendan like four blocks away
from the restaurant where his friend was

223
00:12:35,021 --> 00:12:37,120
killed. If just that one person saw it.

224
00:12:37,121 --> 00:12:40,810
That's one piece of
circumstantial evidence. That's
not enough to convict you.

225
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:45,160
But if a hundred people said they saw
you two blocks away in the parking lot,

226
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:48,430
none of it alone, none of it
standing alone will put you in jail.

227
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:51,730
But at a certain point, enough
circumstantial evidence,

228
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:56,230
we'll put dudes in jail or if enough
people tell the same story about you with

229
00:12:56,231 --> 00:12:58,480
Cosby, it was the same
story over and over.

230
00:12:58,481 --> 00:13:00,280
It's like not all these women can't be,

231
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:03,430
they're all telling the exact same
story about the same MOU. Well,

232
00:13:03,431 --> 00:13:04,031
not only that,

233
00:13:04,031 --> 00:13:08,420
Cosby had gone to court and had a lawsuit
sealed and paid her woman off. Right.

234
00:13:08,421 --> 00:13:11,860
I get it already had been to
a deposition so that, yeah,

235
00:13:11,861 --> 00:13:15,340
so this was a part of the whole thing
was that he had to come out and uh,

236
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:15,930
you know, the,

237
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:19,120
the headed defend that in his most
recent trailer bill Clinton too.

238
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:21,970
I just got done watching those
Monica Lewinsky tapes. Yeah.

239
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,190
Bill Quinn was a freak. Oh yeah. Dude.

240
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,440
Do you know that the only problem
with like being, but like,

241
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,920
it sounded like Alex Jones who makes a
lot of money off his conspiracies and

242
00:13:29,921 --> 00:13:34,810
things, is that if once he says something,
I know a pretty good fan of his Alex.

243
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:35,740
And, um,

244
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,850
what the problem is once you say something
and you have that big of a following,

245
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,130
right. So let's just say
you float out of conspiracy,

246
00:13:42,131 --> 00:13:44,950
but then you look at evidence and you
start to realize maybe I overstepped my

247
00:13:44,951 --> 00:13:47,290
boss, we all say things we wish
we hadn't, or we all say things,

248
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:51,940
but now you've got a whole movement behind
what you said now to try to pull back

249
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:57,390
with turn that 25% of the whoever it is
against you and that can be a liability

250
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:58,121
too.

251
00:13:58,121 --> 00:14:00,910
So one of the things about being a public
figure is you can say something and if

252
00:14:00,911 --> 00:14:04,840
you're selling product and selling
your show on you better be all in.

253
00:14:04,841 --> 00:14:05,770
You better stay all that.

254
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:10,120
So you become a prisoner to your own
kind of first impulse or your own first

255
00:14:10,121 --> 00:14:14,050
sort of like no matter how Atlanta,
especially if he's also an entertainer,

256
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:19,080
it's also this rush to say you'd know
something when you don't know it is a rush

257
00:14:19,361 --> 00:14:23,620
to say there's a rush to say we
absolutely know this happened.

258
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:25,360
We absolutely know that happened cause

259
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:30,400
[inaudible] to get it from
somewhere. He has his sources.

260
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:34,630
What gets probably got information
on on the, on these, you know,

261
00:14:34,631 --> 00:14:36,520
these tragic events or
something like that,

262
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:39,160
or you don't think there'll
be looking at Brandon? Listen,

263
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:43,570
I think he has some people in trouble.
No, I'm not. Don't take your bait,

264
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:46,420
Eddie. He's floating the
fucking huge worm out.

265
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:52,160
[inaudible]

266
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,790
come on this show and try not to
talk about conspiracy theories,

267
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:59,760
but I always get sucked back into
them. I always get sucked back to

268
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:05,150
that, where I'm not, but look, look,
he's there. Legit question. I don't know.

269
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:08,930
You're asking super
crazy, legit questions.
