Speaker 1:          00:01          Listening to radio lab radio from W N y. S. A. N. P. Hello. I'm Jad. I'm Robert. This is radio lab, the podcast. So today, uh, slightly off beat, uh, exploration of acoustic warfare. And we're going to do it by looking at the, a famous, do you know this story? Aye. I know what we're doing. Should I, you remind me, I've heard the phrase walls of Jericho and I know nothing else about it. It's most famous as a song, Josh,

Speaker 2:          00:36          the battle of Jericho. Jericho, Jericho. Joshua fought the battle of Jericho and the walls came tumbling down. Pneumonia. Nudity.

Speaker 1:          00:44          No idea. You don't know that? No. Before my time.

Speaker 2:          00:51          It's a, it's a, it's a negro spiritual to black and said Pac American spiritual. And it's like,

Speaker 1:          01:00          anyway, so tell us the story so we can get started. Well, as you know, the Hebrew people crossed the Red Sea and then wandered around in the desert for awhile. We'll just say I knew that 40 years, 40 years. And now we're up to, we're almost into the promised land, but there is this city called Jericho who is inside Jericho. Well, the Jared Cohen's really the Jericho and they don't know much about them actually. Why aren't they friendly? Are they against God? No, they're just, they just, I think they have all these 40,000 people showed up at the, hey, who are these people? I get the value. So they were just looking after their property, I suppose. Or maybe they just didn't like what they saw. Okay. Now Jericho, you're reading. Now I'm reading from the Bible. Now Jericho was tightly shut because of the sons of Israel. So I guess constant gotta take Jericho.

Speaker 1:          01:44          Maybe that was it. I'm a little fuzzy here on the cause of the thing. It had to be done, had to be done. However, now quoting the Bible, Jericho was tightly shut because it had a wall. Yeah. So read the part about how they knocked down the wall. Here's the formula from the mouth of God, and you shall march around the city, all the men of war, circling the city once and you shall do so for six days. And on the seventh day you shall march around the city seven times and seven priests shall carry seven trumpets of rams horns. It's a show far actually is a Ram's Horn and the priest shall blow the trumpets and it shall be the wall of the city will fall flat down and they do this with seven trumpets. He say yes. All right, so here we go.

Speaker 1:          02:27          The question we have then for this podcast is what would it really take? Josh got the battle of Jericho to do this. I'm talking without God only CUNY physics through your headphones, independent, left and right. Volume control should be fairly comfortable. Is it just in principle possible for sound to blow down a wall? That's their question. We actually called up a guy who's thought about this. I'm an acoustical consultant. David Loveman is his name and an acoustical and if you think about the nature of sound, it's a fluctuating pressure. Explain the wind sound, hits an object like the waves actually push the object but also pull at it many times per second in theoretically. He says if he can get enough of those pushes and pulls on the wall, eventually it will begin to crumble. So the first question he asked nationally is what kind of wall are we dealing with?

Speaker 3:          03:24          Oh, well looking at the construction of Brian's age walls in the Middle East, uh, there were mud brick walls. Uh, how the question then was how much sound would be necessary? What volume to topple a wall like that? Yeah. And he came up with a number. This is a technical number for the strength of the sound. You'd need to produce 177 DV. 177 decibels. Yes. That would knock down the wall. Yes. How, how many decibels? Just for scale is my voice right now roughly? Oh, your voice is probably about 60 or 65 decibels. Oh, so already a third of the way there. Just talking. Well, no,

Speaker 1:          04:07          Jerry go body. Here's where the issue start. Turns out, he says it sound doesn't add up the way that you would think a shoe. And there's the rub. Assume that your voice level was 60 decibels. In order to get the 70 disheveled, you would have to produce 10 times as much power. Just didn't make much sense to us until we ended up doing what he did in recruiting some experience show far blowers from a heading towards there are from synagogues. Yes. We went up to all souls. A unit. What does it all souls. UNITARIAN church. Many times a month. That church actually is hosting to a synagogue. Oh my God, I hear them. Crap. Did you hear that? Like animals dying.

Speaker 4:          04:57          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          04:59          alright, so shofars were the horns that apparently knocked down the wall. So we wanted to measure how loud they could be and we were lucky enough to find this guy Panter Daniel Pincus, who got together about 10 people. Everybody with their rams horns. Okay. A Yemenite show far. The Daniels was not quite a Ram's horn. Probably from either an animal called a kudu, perhaps from an antelope. I'm not exactly sure. It's quite big. Quite big. It's about [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          05:27          two

Speaker 3:          05:27          [inaudible] fee plus a few inches. Wow. In that somewhat corkscrew shape. Um, so any case he got us started and eh, we asked them to blow his show far as loud as he could and we were going to measure the decibel level

Speaker 5:          05:43          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          05:51          just up to 96 but now I'm not satisfied. All right,

Speaker 3:          05:55          so that was our baseline. 96 decibels for one show far player. But interestingly when we doubled it had to show far players listen to what happened. We only got up to 98 just shy of 99 and when we doubled that, went from two to four show far players

Speaker 5:          06:20          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          06:20          we only bumped it up three more decibels. Think we got a hundred a month.

Speaker 5:          06:24          Wow.

Speaker 1:          06:26          Turns out, and this is actually a rule of thumb. Anytime you want to bump up your overall volume by three decibels, you've got to double

Speaker 5:          06:34          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          06:35          the amount of shofar players. So if you want to go from 101 DV to 104, that means going from four show far players to eight. Do you want to go from 104 to 107? That means eight shofar players become 16. And if you want to go from there all the way up to our target 177 DB, well then you're going to have to double yourself a lot. But here's the question. How many Indian, how many shofars would you need?

Speaker 3:          06:59          I'll make the roles of jerk and down. The number I calculate it is 407,380 and it might take a while.

Speaker 1:          07:16          Well wait a second. Seven is what the Bible says. And you just said (400) 700-0380

Speaker 3:          07:22          yes. And that would be a minimum number. That's five rose bowls full of trumpet players. But of course if it was a miracle, all bets are off. But what if you could get that number of people together? Could you still do it? Can you knock down the wall? Well, with the, with the puny physic went into David, we still have a problem. Unfortunately, the problem I had was getting a very large number of men show close to the wall that we could produce the necessary pressure. And as I added men, I'd have to put them further and further back. Imagine he says you've got all these hornblower's hundreds of thousands at this wall. You've got to organize them, put them in rows, and that creates a little bit of a situation. Oh yes. Well, the, uh, the, uh, people in the front row would, uh, have their heads blown off by the lash of the people behind them. That's a sort of problem. If you're a musician, I think if you'd like, we could do an experiment. Uh, do you volunteer? No,

Speaker 5:          08:17          she thinks about [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          08:27          Okay. But what if you could put the people in the front row and helmets to protect them then continuously we have another problem. That's right. The sound according to the, has to be focused in as to actually sort of point at one spot on the wall when you put that many people together in front of a wall. Some of them are gonna be way behind the ones in front. We're going to lose focus and there's the problem. But then we found woody. Yeah. My formal name is Norris.

Speaker 6:          08:56          I go by woody.

Speaker 3:          08:57          We called woody because, well, he's an inventor, president, chairman and CEO of a brand new company called parametric sound corporation and he may be able to help us with our focus problem because he's invented a technology that can beam sound in a direct line like a laser, which I'm going to demonstrate for your friend here. Let's check some of these, some of these things up. That's reporter Kirk Conan. Okay. First I'm going to play you this guy to demonstrate. He pulls out his a sound bemer. It's like a mini satellite dish, but kind of in a square

Speaker 5:          09:29          stand over there.

Speaker 3:          09:31          He and Kirk get on opposite sides of the room very far apart and then what? He shoots a concentrated beam of sound in this case, the sound of rushing water,

Speaker 5:          09:39          right? It hurts head. No. If I showed it at you towards the night just aiming at my chest, almost a hundred percent gone. [inaudible] wow. Magic.

Speaker 3:          10:05          Does your invention allow us to take the sound and put it into a beam such that it will hit a spot on the wall of Jericho? Absolutely. With a caveat. The caveat.

Speaker 6:          10:19          There is no known loudspeaker on the planet that can put out 170 decibels. Really, my company makes some of the loudest speakers on the planet. They're known quite popularly around the world as an El Rad long range acoustic device. They're sold to the military police departments and the loudest unit the company sells, which can be over $100,000 for one unit, puts out about 155 decibels. That's not enough to knock down our wall though. No, not at all. There's another issue. This'll be caveat number two. When you get about 150 565 decibels, you get close to causing cavitation in the air where the air turns into a plasma.

Speaker 3:          11:10          What do you mean with sound won't travel through the air only for a few millimeters. We weren't able to, 1000% confirmed this, but according to woody, even if we were able to make the necessary amount of noise, we would not be able to get that noise to the wall. The sound just go

Speaker 5:          11:32          mayor.

Speaker 3:          11:32          We are just, I, there's a, there's a Anglo Saxon where they would go right there, but we're talking about the Hebrews. But we are that thing and I don't know what to do. Well, I had an alternate theory that could make Fi's story plausible. Ah, what I've imagined is that the attackers would try to undermine wall by digging underneath it and the uh, defenders figuring that the attackers would do that, which sends spies out to find out where the digging is so they can use counter measures such as boiling oil. Right. But we then the wait, no, wait, wait, wait, let him finish this. I'm enjoying this. Okay. But then the attackers would say, they'll probably send out spies to find out where we're digging. So let's issue orders, uh, that nobody is to know where we are digging and we won't tell those blabber mouth Israelites because it's sure to be picked up by one of the spies.

Speaker 3:          12:28          And next thing you know, we'll have warning oral on our head. In the meantime, the diggers, in order to keep the wall from falling in on them, they would prop it up with timbers. Then when the digging was about complete, they would pull out the whatever was the equivalent of a Zippo lighter in the bronze age and a light the timbers and then run like heck as the fire burns through, eventually that part of the wall would fall straight down and the weight is the Hornblower cut into the equation. Oh, well in the meantime, the spies report back. We can't figure out where those Israelites, they're digging. So, uh, the king of Jericho probably says, well, we'll have to use the old hole in the shield trick to find out. And so they take their bronze age shields with a hole in the middle and they placed him on the ground. Tackers say the defenders will probably use the old hole in the shield trick. We know that. So we'll have to use acoustic warfare, make noise to, uh, prevent them from being able to hear where the digging is. So let's send out a bunch of priests with shofars and to make noise. And so as I there to keep the shield listening, Jericho ins from overhearing the digging Hebrews and the fluids are just the way to mask the digging Hebrews is located. Boom. Rod. Hi Robert. Krulwich. Bye.
