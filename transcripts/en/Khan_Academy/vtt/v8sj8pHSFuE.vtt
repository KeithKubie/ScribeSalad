00:00:00.621 --> 00:00:03.221
- [Instructor] In any
textbook overview of Hinduism

00:00:03.221 --> 00:00:06.244
you will quickly encounter
the caste system,

00:00:06.244 --> 00:00:10.687
and the caste system is the
notion that people are born

00:00:10.687 --> 00:00:14.719
into the roles that they
have to play in society.

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:16.983
Now the reason why I put this in quotes

00:00:16.983 --> 00:00:20.038
is because they're associated this notion

00:00:20.038 --> 00:00:24.053
from the various Hindu
scripture of Varnas,

00:00:24.053 --> 00:00:26.113
but the best translation from Sanskrit

00:00:26.113 --> 00:00:29.049
into English of Varnas is classes.

00:00:29.049 --> 00:00:31.141
And it's interesting
to think about whether

00:00:31.141 --> 00:00:34.298
they were first intended
to be just social classes,

00:00:34.298 --> 00:00:39.143
or also hereditary classes
as the caste system implies.

00:00:39.143 --> 00:00:42.685
What we do know is that as
we approach modern Hinduism

00:00:42.685 --> 00:00:44.828
over the last several hundred years,

00:00:44.828 --> 00:00:47.343
it did approach something that was more

00:00:47.343 --> 00:00:49.216
what you are born into.

00:00:49.216 --> 00:00:51.020
But we'll look a little
bit at the scripture

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.318
and I'll leave it up to you to decide

00:00:52.318 --> 00:00:54.111
whether it was more of a social class

00:00:54.111 --> 00:00:57.333
or if it was a class
that you were born into.

00:00:57.333 --> 00:01:01.434
Now the four Varnas that
are described in the Vedas

00:01:01.434 --> 00:01:03.324
and other Hindu scripture,

00:01:03.324 --> 00:01:05.396
at the top you have the Brahmins

00:01:05.396 --> 00:01:07.625
who are the priests and the teachers,

00:01:07.625 --> 00:01:10.560
not to be confused with the god Brahma

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.024
or the ultimate reality, Brahman.

00:01:14.024 --> 00:01:15.643
Next you have the Kshatriyas

00:01:15.643 --> 00:01:17.735
who are the warriors and rulers.

00:01:17.735 --> 00:01:19.590
And it's interesting that
at least in Hindu society

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.955
the Brahmins were considered higher

00:01:21.955 --> 00:01:25.229
than the warriors, the rulers, the kings.

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.712
After that you have the Vaishyas

00:01:26.712 --> 00:01:28.807
who are the farmers, the merchants.

00:01:28.807 --> 00:01:31.841
And then next the Shudras, the laborers,

00:01:31.841 --> 00:01:35.608
those who worked in service
to the other three classes.

00:01:35.608 --> 00:01:39.016
Now you also had and have
people who are outside

00:01:39.016 --> 00:01:41.683
of these four different classes.

00:01:42.594 --> 00:01:45.126
Today they refer to themselves as Dalits,

00:01:45.126 --> 00:01:46.827
which means the oppressed,

00:01:46.827 --> 00:01:50.054
but sometimes they've been
referred to as untouchable,

00:01:50.054 --> 00:01:53.749
and that's because in
traditional Hindu society

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:56.769
many of these people weren't
even able to enter temples,

00:01:56.769 --> 00:01:58.188
they were discriminated against,

00:01:58.188 --> 00:02:00.802
they didn't have access to resources,

00:02:00.802 --> 00:02:02.761
they weren't even allowed to shake hands

00:02:02.761 --> 00:02:05.478
or make physical contact
with other members

00:02:05.478 --> 00:02:06.895
of Hindu society.

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.554
And we'll talk a little
bit more about how this may

00:02:10.554 --> 00:02:12.836
or may not be changing.

00:02:12.836 --> 00:02:17.038
Now to see the basis of the
Varna system in scripture

00:02:17.038 --> 00:02:20.871
I will start with this
quote from the Rigveda.

00:02:21.864 --> 00:02:23.603
Now this is from the Purusha Sukta,

00:02:23.603 --> 00:02:28.314
and Purusha in the Vedas you
can view as this cosmic being,

00:02:28.314 --> 00:02:30.773
but they anthropomorphize this being,

00:02:30.773 --> 00:02:35.144
making it seem or making an
analogy with a human body.

00:02:35.144 --> 00:02:36.986
"When they divided the Cosmic Being,

00:02:36.986 --> 00:02:39.550
"how many portions did they make?

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.197
"What do they call his mouth, his arms?

00:02:42.197 --> 00:02:44.632
"What do they call his thighs and feet?

00:02:44.632 --> 00:02:46.786
"The Brahmin was his mouth,

00:02:46.786 --> 00:02:49.912
"of both arms was the Rajanya made."

00:02:49.912 --> 00:02:52.106
The Rajanya you could
view as the Kshatriyas,

00:02:52.106 --> 00:02:53.811
the warriors and the kings.

00:02:53.811 --> 00:02:55.851
"His thighs became the Vaishya,

00:02:55.851 --> 00:02:59.107
"from his feet the Sudra was produced."

00:02:59.107 --> 00:03:02.232
So in the Vedas, and there's some dispute

00:03:02.232 --> 00:03:04.236
about whether this was
originally in the Vedas

00:03:04.236 --> 00:03:06.448
or about whether it was added later,

00:03:06.448 --> 00:03:08.494
to have a creation story,

00:03:08.494 --> 00:03:12.456
but it is making reference
to these four Varnas.

00:03:12.456 --> 00:03:15.328
But here it is not 100%
clear whether it's just

00:03:15.328 --> 00:03:17.521
talking about the various
classes of society.

00:03:17.521 --> 00:03:19.497
You're bound to have some
priests and teachers,

00:03:19.497 --> 00:03:21.251
some warriors and rulers,
some farmers, merchants,

00:03:21.251 --> 00:03:22.348
some laborers.

00:03:22.348 --> 00:03:25.471
Or are they saying
something more fundamental?

00:03:25.471 --> 00:03:28.727
Now we can go to the
time of the Mahabharata,

00:03:28.727 --> 00:03:30.165
when the Mahabharata was written

00:03:30.165 --> 00:03:32.370
and the subset of the Mahabharata

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:33.925
which is the Bhagavad Gita,

00:03:33.925 --> 00:03:37.081
and they also make reference
to this Varna system.

00:03:37.081 --> 00:03:40.538
So the Bhagavad Gita is
the part of the Mahabharata

00:03:40.538 --> 00:03:43.681
where you have Krishna talking to Arjuna

00:03:43.681 --> 00:03:46.685
and reassuring him about his role in life,

00:03:46.685 --> 00:03:50.361
and this is what Krishna tells Arjuna.

00:03:50.361 --> 00:03:54.105
"A Brahman's virtues, born
of his nature, are serenity,

00:03:54.105 --> 00:03:57.649
"self-control, austerity,
purity, tolerance,

00:03:57.649 --> 00:04:00.366
"honesty, learning, and to know the truth

00:04:00.366 --> 00:04:02.278
"of things which be.

00:04:02.278 --> 00:04:04.942
"A Kshatriya's pride, born of his nature,

00:04:04.942 --> 00:04:07.339
"lives in valor,
exuberance, determination,

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:09.803
"resourcefulness, bravery in battle,

00:04:09.803 --> 00:04:14.376
"and generosity and noble
demeanor as a lord of men.

00:04:14.376 --> 00:04:17.563
"A Vaisya's task, born with his nature,

00:04:17.563 --> 00:04:21.464
"is to till the ground,
tend cattle, venture trade.

00:04:21.464 --> 00:04:25.818
"A Sudra's state, suiting
his nature, is service."

00:04:25.818 --> 00:04:30.003
Arguably in service to
the other three classes.

00:04:30.003 --> 00:04:33.210
Now once again, it doesn't
make strict reference

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.369
to you are born a Brahmin,

00:04:35.369 --> 00:04:37.843
if your father was a Brahmin
then you have to be a Brahmin,

00:04:37.843 --> 00:04:42.014
or if your father was a Kshatriya,
you will be a Kshatriya.

00:04:42.014 --> 00:04:44.069
It is making reference to this idea

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:46.569
of being "born of his nature."

00:04:48.292 --> 00:04:50.015
So you could interpret that as,

00:04:50.015 --> 00:04:52.968
this is this idea that you
have some innate gifts,

00:04:52.968 --> 00:04:54.822
you have some innate tendencies,

00:04:54.822 --> 00:04:57.827
and those innate tendencies
are going to dictate

00:04:57.827 --> 00:05:00.750
whether you're going to
be a Brahmin, a Kshatriya,

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.208
a Vaisya, or a Shudra.

00:05:03.208 --> 00:05:05.496
I encourage you as always to look up

00:05:05.496 --> 00:05:07.109
the primary documents yourself,

00:05:07.109 --> 00:05:08.642
and especially when you're
looking at something

00:05:08.642 --> 00:05:09.859
that is a translation,

00:05:09.859 --> 00:05:12.255
this is a translation
from Sanskrit to English,

00:05:12.255 --> 00:05:14.248
how it is translated matters.

00:05:14.248 --> 00:05:16.034
So try to look up multiple translations

00:05:16.034 --> 00:05:18.716
and come to your own conclusion.

00:05:18.716 --> 00:05:22.313
Now regardless of whether
the ancient Hindu scripture,

00:05:22.313 --> 00:05:25.148
the Bhagavad Gita is over 2,000 years old,

00:05:25.148 --> 00:05:26.884
if we're talking about the Vedas

00:05:26.884 --> 00:05:29.905
and especially if the Purusha Sukta

00:05:29.905 --> 00:05:31.495
was part of the original Vedas,

00:05:31.495 --> 00:05:33.754
we're talking about something
that's over 3,000 years old,

00:05:33.754 --> 00:05:36.912
regardless of the original
intent of the Varna system,

00:05:36.912 --> 00:05:39.675
whether it was supposed to
be just talking about classes

00:05:39.675 --> 00:05:42.514
as opposed to a hereditary caste,

00:05:42.514 --> 00:05:45.943
the reality is is over the
last several hundred years

00:05:45.943 --> 00:05:48.722
in India it did become a caste.

00:05:48.722 --> 00:05:51.881
People whose parents were
Brahmins became Brahmins.

00:05:51.881 --> 00:05:55.053
People whose parents were
Kshatriyas became Kshatriyas.

00:05:55.053 --> 00:05:56.977
And they married amongst themselves,

00:05:56.977 --> 00:06:00.939
and it did dictate their social status.

00:06:00.939 --> 00:06:03.409
And so to put all of this in perspective

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:05.075
I'm going to give you a quote from

00:06:05.075 --> 00:06:08.592
really one of India's founding fathers.

00:06:08.592 --> 00:06:10.950
So this is a picture of B.R. Ambedkar

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:13.161
and he was born a Dalit,

00:06:13.161 --> 00:06:17.161
and faced significant discrimination
when he was growing up.

00:06:17.161 --> 00:06:18.511
He wasn't allowed to sit on chairs

00:06:18.511 --> 00:06:20.888
or eat next to his fellow students.

00:06:20.888 --> 00:06:23.523
As you can imagine his family
wouldn't have had access

00:06:23.523 --> 00:06:26.286
to nowhere near the
resources that other people

00:06:26.286 --> 00:06:28.768
in the village or in the city
would have had access to.

00:06:28.768 --> 00:06:31.398
They would have been
actively discriminated with,

00:06:31.398 --> 00:06:33.154
they wouldn't have even been
able to make physical contact

00:06:33.154 --> 00:06:35.934
with members of the formal Varna system.

00:06:35.934 --> 00:06:38.790
But despite all of that discrimination

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:41.455
he was able to get a significant education

00:06:41.455 --> 00:06:44.729
and eventually become
India's first Law Minister,

00:06:44.729 --> 00:06:47.008
and not only that, but
the principal architect

00:06:47.008 --> 00:06:49.570
of the Indian Constitution.

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:52.544
And this is what he wrote
about the caste system.

00:06:52.544 --> 00:06:55.561
"Caste is not a physical
object like a wall of bricks

00:06:55.561 --> 00:06:58.198
"or a line of barbed wire
which prevents the Hindus

00:06:58.198 --> 00:07:02.011
"from co-mingling and which has
therefore to be pulled down.

00:07:02.011 --> 00:07:05.670
"Caste is a notion, it
is a state of the mind."

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:08.057
And if you look at modern India

00:07:08.057 --> 00:07:09.962
or if you talk to modern Hindus,

00:07:09.962 --> 00:07:13.976
many of them will say hey, we
don't take caste seriously.

00:07:13.976 --> 00:07:16.507
We view this as a part of our past,

00:07:16.507 --> 00:07:17.840
and a part of our past

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:20.099
that we're not necessarily that proud of.

00:07:20.099 --> 00:07:21.926
But there are still Hindus who do take

00:07:21.926 --> 00:07:23.338
the caste system seriously,

00:07:23.338 --> 00:07:25.515
especially if you go into
rural areas and villages.

00:07:25.515 --> 00:07:27.796
Many of the things that
B.R. Ambedkar faced,

00:07:27.796 --> 00:07:29.450
this level of discrimination,

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:32.590
of Dalits not being able to go a temple,

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:34.716
not having access to water resources,

00:07:34.716 --> 00:07:36.491
this is still happening in India.

00:07:36.491 --> 00:07:40.335
And in things like
inter-marriage the caste system

00:07:40.335 --> 00:07:43.896
is still taken reasonably
seriously by a large portion

00:07:43.896 --> 00:07:45.896
of the Hindu population.

00:07:46.783 --> 00:07:50.310
Now here's another quote
from B.R. Ambedkar.

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:52.369
"Some men say that they
should be satisfied

00:07:52.369 --> 00:07:55.170
"with the abolition of
untouchability only,

00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:57.428
"leaving the caste system alone.

00:07:57.428 --> 00:07:59.892
"The aim of abolition
of untouchability alone

00:07:59.892 --> 00:08:02.747
"without trying to
abolish the inequalities

00:08:02.747 --> 00:08:06.914
"inherent in the caste
system is a rather low aim."
