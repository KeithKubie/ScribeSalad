00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.300
Hi, I'm John Green, this is Crash Course World
History, and today we continue our discussion

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:08.330
of how a regional conflict became World War
I. We're also going to look at who started

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:14.139
the war and although no one nation is truly
to blame, some nations are more to blame than others.

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:19.300
Like America, for once? Blameless. Well, not
totally blameless. Largely blameless.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.580
Mr. Green, Mr. Green! That's easy, the Germans
started the war.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.840
Well, Me from the Past, as it happens many
historians and British politicians would agree

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:31.360
with you. I mean, you have an opinion that can be
defended. And I can't wait for you to defend it.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:37.300
Uhh... maybe they just, like, really liked war? I'm
not really in the defending positions business,

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.410
Mr. Green, I'm more in the like, bold proclamations
business.

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.710
Yes, Me from the Past, noted. But it turns
out, there's more to life than that.

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.680
So the topic of who started World War I remains
one of the most controversial and interesting

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.780
topics to discuss in World History, not least because,
you know, we'd like to avoid having another one.

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.389
But in general, when we talk about World Wars,
as when we talk about World Cups, we pretty

00:01:06.389 --> 00:01:08.229
quickly end up discussing Germany.

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:12.229
The idea that the root cause of World War
I was Germany, or more specifically, German

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:16.389
militarism, continues to be popular. This
has been the case ever since the 1960s when

00:01:16.389 --> 00:01:21.200
this historian, Fritz Fisher, identified Germany
as the chief cause of the war. But Germany's

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.079
guilt for the war was also written into the
Versailles Peace Treaty, in article 231, and

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:30.479
most of you will be familiar with the idea
that anger over that clause its incumbent

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.999
debts helped lead to Hitler's rise.

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:37.259
Also, pretty much however you slice it Germany
was definitely responsible for starting World

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.999
War II, and looking back that made it more
plausible that they would have also stated

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:44.959
World War I, because, you know, they had a
history of starting wars. To be fair, the

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.060
definition of a Western European nation is
"has a history starting wars."

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.060
Unless you're the Swiss.

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.760
Cue the Switzereel, Stan!

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:03.420
Yeah okay, but the thing is attributing characteristics
like militarism or authoritarianism to entire

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:09.479
national populations is a little problematic.
Also one nation's militarism is another nation's

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.189
strong national defense, and when you live
in the country, as I do, that spends more

00:02:14.189 --> 00:02:19.510
on defense than any other nation, it's probably
not that good of an idea to call people militaristic.

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.459
There's just something about that broad-brush
painting of an entire nation sharing a particular

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:29.159
characteristic that feels a little bit propaganda-y.
Also, it wasn't just Germans who were militaristic

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:35.530
in 1914. The idea of "the glory of war" was
a very popular concept all over Europe, and

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.439
really there's no evidence that the German
people of 1914 were any more or less militaristic

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:44.859
than the French or the Russians, They all
had poetry that celebrated heroic sacrifice

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:47.879
and dying for the Mother and/or Fatherland.

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:53.140
That's not usually and. Maybe, though. I'm
gonna stay open minded.

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.409
But there's another problem with the whole
idea that the Germans were more eager for

00:02:56.409 --> 00:03:00.670
war than anyone else in Europe. That argument
relies a lot on the behavior of Kaiser Wilhelm

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.439
II, the German leader, and the Kaiser did
make some pretty bellicose and stupid public

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:09.349
statements, which in turn made people fear
that Germans were eager for war. So Wilhelm

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:15.010
became kind of a stand-in for German aggression,
a literal cartoon villain, upon whom the world,

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.129
especially the English, could project their
stereotypes.

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:22.989
So I would argue that the German character
isn't to blame for World War I, and in fact

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:28.069
no national character has ever been to blame
for any war. But I am not going to let the

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:29.560
Germans off the hook entirely.

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.189
So you will remember that Germany offered
the so-called "blank check" that Germans would

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:39.209
always support Austro-Hungarians' ultimatum
to Serbia. And in some ways this empowering

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:44.439
by Germany's support encouraged Austria's
foreign minister Berchtold to behave as recklessly

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:48.919
as possible, under the mistaken impression that
this is what the Germans wanted him to do.

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.680
So basically, Austria thought that Germany
wanted a war, so they were like, "Oh, we'll

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.439
just behave really recklessly and we'll give
the Germans the war they've been so excited

00:03:56.439 --> 00:04:00.950
about." But the Germans were offering the
Austrians the assurance of support in the

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:02.459
hopes that it wouldn't lead to war.

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:06.249
So you could argue that in fact most of the
blame for starting World War I should fall

00:04:06.249 --> 00:04:10.359
on the shoulders of the Austrians, after all,
they were the ones who issued the ultimatum

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:15.200
to Serbia, and they were the first to declare
war, although only against Serbia. But, the

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:20.239
Germans were the first to declare war on a
major power, Russia, on August 1st, and the

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:24.090
German advance on France through Belgium is
what brought Britain into the war. And those

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.830
are pretty solid arguments that Germany turned
the conflict from, you know, a regional thing

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:32.280
in the Balkans, which isn't unprecedented,
to like this big pan-European war.

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.030
But I don't think we're done assigning blame,
because we didn't just have a pan-European

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.370
war, we had a world war. Russia.

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.340
Now you'll remember that of all the major
powers, Russia was the first to mobilize its

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:48.740
massive army, and it was Russia's mobilization that
drew Germany, France, and Britain into the war.

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:52.340
Putin is looking at me, isn't he, Stan. I'm
just trying to--ah! you so scary!

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.310
Stan, can you please make Mr. Putin go away,
I'm just trying to talk about history, I'm

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:56.910
not talking about any current conflicts.

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:01.490
And it makes me nervous to say this, but there
was really no good reason for Russia to mobilize

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.900
in the first place. I mean, when Austria declared
war on Serbia on July 28th, the Austrians

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:10.660
could not mobilize their own troops for two
weeks, because they were on harvest break.

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:14.090
I mean, if we've learned anything about agriculture,
it's that it's hard to have a large-scale

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:17.710
war without it, so we can't go to war until
all the wheat has been farmed.

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:21.669
But even if Austria had mobilized and attacked
immediately, their initial plan was an attack

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:26.500
on Belgrade, not Russia, which by the way
was called somewhat confusingly, Plan B. Now,

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:30.129
Vienna did have a plan to mobilize against
both Serbia and Russia, but they never used

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:37.309
it. But even if Austria had launched an all-out
attack on Russia, Russia had begun its pre-mobilization,

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:42.639
the period preparatory to war, on July 25th,
and while I usually don't care about dates,

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:47.000
with the start of World War I, very important,
because July 25th was before the Serbs had

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.870
even responded to the Austrian ultimatum.

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:53.970
And just as a general rule, it's hard to play
the blameless victim when you're moving all

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:57.009
of your troops to the border. Hey, why are
you here again, Putin?

00:05:57.009 --> 00:06:01.169
So here we have Austrians and Germans receiving
reports of Russian troops massing on their

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:05.289
borders, and you know, that seems kind of
like war. A lot of it comes down to how you

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:11.009
understand Russia's period preparatory to
war. I mean, do you focus on the "period preparatory",

00:06:11.009 --> 00:06:16.280
or do you focus on the "to war"? Regardless,
Russia became the first power to actually

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:18.139
put its war machine into motion.

00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:19.169
Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:23.159
So talking about Russia leads us to some of
the more meta arguments about the causes of

00:06:23.159 --> 00:06:28.129
World War I because it's difficult to understand
what Russia was doing when it mobilized without

00:06:28.129 --> 00:06:33.360
trying to understand why they mobilized. After
all, an Austrian attack on Serbia was hardly

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:38.530
an existential threat to Russia, I mean, look
at the map. Russia's huge, and at the time,

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:42.330
probably had the largest army in Europe, if
not the world. So why would they care about

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:45.220
what was likely to be a skirmish on the Bosnian
border?

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:48.970
Well, here's where geo-politics and history
come in. So, looking at the map, you can see

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:53.800
that the Balkans are right next to the Dardanelles,
the straits that give access to the Black

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:59.280
Sea. Russia needed to maintain influence there
in order to ensure traffic through those straits,

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:03.919
especially if the Ottomans were going to form
an alliance with the Germans, which they did.

00:07:03.919 --> 00:07:08.150
Also, at least in its own estimation, Russia
was in danger of becoming a laughingstock

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:13.050
in European politics: their humiliating loss
to Japan in the Russo-Japanese War was followed

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:17.849
by Russia's inability to stop Austria from
annexing Bosnia from the Ottomans in 1908,

00:07:17.849 --> 00:07:21.620
and that was the event that sparked Serbia's
drive to expand its own territory. Its history

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:26.340
of prior weakness meant that Russia's foreign
policy makers feared that without some decisive

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:29.349
action, Russia wouldn't be taken seriously
anymore.

00:07:29.349 --> 00:07:33.610
In the wake of Austria's ultimatum, Russian
foreign minister Sazonov concluded that Russia,

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:38.949
quote, "Could not remain a passive spectator
whilst a Slavonic people was being trampled

00:07:38.949 --> 00:07:43.919
down. If Russia failed to fulfill her historic
mission, she would be considered a decadent

00:07:43.919 --> 00:07:48.860
state and would henceforth have to take second
place among the powers...if at this critical

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:53.919
juncture, the Serbs were abandoned to their
fate, Russian prestige in the Balkans would

00:07:53.919 --> 00:07:55.009
collapse utterly."

00:07:55.009 --> 00:07:55.979
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:07:55.979 --> 00:07:58.909
So judging from what we just learned in the
Thought Bubble, it was really the Ottomans.

00:07:58.909 --> 00:08:02.860
If they could have just stopped Austria from
annexing Bosnia in the first place, none of

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:05.699
this would have happened. And if I may go
a little further back, there wouldn't have

00:08:05.699 --> 00:08:10.039
even been an Ottoman Empire without the stupid
Romans. And of course the Roman Empire was

00:08:10.039 --> 00:08:14.780
largely dependent upon constant expansion
and looting, so if only the Gauls could have

00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:17.180
defeated Caesar, none of this would have happened.

00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:22.600
In short, no wonder Caesar was assassinated,
he was about to start World War I in 1900 years.

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:25.639
I bring that up because that's the tricky
thing about the blame game. You can trace

00:08:25.639 --> 00:08:29.259
the causes of World War I back a bunch of
ways. I mean, I can't think of anyone who

00:08:29.259 --> 00:08:34.880
you can't at least partially assign blame
to - well, I mean except the Mongols.

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:39.360
Actually you know what, if they'd just kept
control of Russia, probably no World War I.

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:43.260
Anyway, all of this only scratches the surface
of the arguments about who's to blame for

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:47.860
World War I. I mean, I haven't dealt with
stuff like the alliance system or European

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:51.890
imperialism, or you often hear about the naval
rivalry between Britain and Germany, and then

00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:56.630
there are the ideological causes, like nationalism,
and the Social Darwinist thinking that led

00:08:56.630 --> 00:09:01.550
people to believe that war was a natural and
inevitable state of human affairs.

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:05.660
You can tell all those origin stories of the
Great War, and they're important, but ours

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:09.190
centers on diplomatic history. There are a
few reasons for this, first, the decision

00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:13.890
to go to war was ultimately in the hands of
a very small group of diplomats. I mean, even

00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:18.600
in the most democratic countries, Britain
and France, popular opinion didn't force mobilization.

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:23.440
Also, in most countries that's still the case.
It's still diplomats who decide whether to

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:28.540
go to war. So understanding what makes governments
and diplomats decide to go to war is very important.

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:31.970
But looking at the diplomatic causes of the
war also reveals something to us about the

00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:37.030
pitfalls of writing history. I mean diplomats
are famous for keeping pretty detailed records

00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:41.160
of their dealings, both at the time and in
retrospect, and then historians have to sift

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:45.710
through all these sources and make choices
about which ones to emphasize. And sometimes,

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:50.000
even which ones to believe, because of course,
often these sources are in direct conflict.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.260
Now, I'm no historian, but in creating this
episode, we had to make choices that many

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:57.500
of you will disagree with. Either because
you don't think we gave enough evidence or

00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:01.510
because you don't like the things that we
emphasized, and that's great. It's these constructive

00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:06.310
and critical conversations that lead us to
dig deeper, to consult more primary sources,

00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:10.590
to read more broadly, and that in turn leads
to a richer understanding of the world and

00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:12.200
a more engaged life.

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:15.640
All that noted, the alliance system was certainly
important and I'm sure you'll be discussing

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:17.950
it in your classes, and in comments.

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:20.170
Thank you for watching, I'll see you next
week.
