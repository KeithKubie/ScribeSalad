00:00:07.464 --> 00:00:09.880
SAMIR FALKE: Have you ever
designed and developed products

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.880
for users who are very
different from you?

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.420
Well, today, we are going to go
over some tips and strategies

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.390
to deeply understand
your user and to create

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.470
effective products for them at
speed, using immersive design

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:24.730
sprints.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:26.170
I'm Samir Falke.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.240
I'm a design lead
at Google Station.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.430
And Google station
is a product that's

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:33.530
building high quality
public Wi-Fi for users

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.200
in next billion user markets.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.450
BURGAN SHEALY: And I'm Burgan.

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:39.370
I'm a designer on
the Chrome team,

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.950
focusing on our
next billion users.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.450
All right, let's jump
right in and talk about--

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:50.050
there we go.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.640
What is a design sprint?

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.240
So we'll do a brief
recap of design sprints.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.260
So we define a design
sprint as a framework

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.980
for answering critical business
questions through design,

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.250
prototyping, and testing
our ideas with users

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.880
to generate actionable
feedback and insights.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.430
Now, design sprints
were created at Google,

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.660
and they have evolved over time.

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.560
They're a mix of methods from
design thinking, business

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.860
strategy, psychology,
and user research,

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.950
that were all selected
and ordered specifically

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.520
to support divergent
and convergent thinking,

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.580
and to drive towards
a targeted outcome.

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.770
So what's different
about a design sprint

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.030
is that we set clear goals
and deliverables upfront.

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.310
We time box all
of the activities

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.980
so that we not only speed up
the learning and development

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:46.600
process, but we also drive the
right behaviors from our users.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.110
And then finally, we enable
a wide range of disciplines

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.440
and stakeholders to participate
in the design and development

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.090
process.

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.690
Now, design is not
an individual sport.

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.200
And design sprints are a
highly collaborative process.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.440
We want to be able to
include multiple perspectives

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.030
and points of views.

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.009
And to that end,
we leverage sprints

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.540
to include all
participant's voices.

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.780
The design is a highly
flexible framework,

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.760
and you'll want to
flex it and adapt it

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.450
to your particular
challenge or scenario.

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.760
One of the advantages
of the sprint

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.210
is you can reduce the risks
of downstream mistakes

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:30.730
by getting to insights
that lead to a better

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.230
understanding of your user and
your problem space quicker.

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.360
So today, we're going
to talk about a way

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.540
that we have flexed the design
sprint to really get a better

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.590
understanding of users that are
very different from ourselves.

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.100
Through immersion,
intercepts, and co-creation,

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.130
we're bringing actual users
instead of representatives

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.640
of those users into the center
of the design and development

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.300
process.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.770
Now, there's a phenomenon known
as the co-creation effect.

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.160
And it shows that when
organizations and consumers

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.370
create something
together, both parties are

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.880
more invested in the outcome.

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.170
So what does this
look like in practice?

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.810
We're going to start by
bringing a team together

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.300
of very different disciplines,
including UX, Eng, PM,

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.080
to create a powerful team.

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.380
We're looking for a
good representation

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.540
of roles and skills.

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.390
And this is going to allow
us to dramatically reduce

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.180
the amount of time that
we spend communicating

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.400
and increase the number of
viable ideas that we generate.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.590
So once we have
our team together,

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.860
we're going to walk through
the five sprint phases,

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:47.770
understand, sketch, decide,
prototype, and validate.

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:51.040
Now, we have a mix of
structured individual work

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.650
and planned group
discussions that

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.410
support a clear
diverge and converge

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.960
process that will
guide the team to get

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.180
on the same page
around the artifacts

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.540
that it's going to produce
to test with the users.

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.310
Now, the ideal design
sprint is going

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.100
to provide time for
team members to reflect

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.790
on the challenge, and also,
opportunities to validate

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:14.335
or disrupt those ideas.

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.740
So the goal for the first
phase, the understand phase,

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:23.460
is to gather all of the relevant
data and information at hand.

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:24.990
We really want to
create a shared

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.510
brain and a line around
a new world together,

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:30.930
and a new understanding
of the problem space.

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.030
Then, we're going to move
on to the sketch phase.

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:34.696
And this is when we're
going to generate

00:04:34.696 --> 00:04:38.880
tons and tons of ideas,
tons of potential solutions.

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.150
And we're going to use
a couple of exercises

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.730
that are designed to get the
ideas out of your participant's

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:47.700
head onto paper, and
to really push them

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:50.940
to go beyond their first idea to
get better and more innovative

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.130
ideas.

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.230
Now, once we have
all of these ideas

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:57.150
and we're in the
middle of a sprint,

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.280
we have tons and tons
of solutions, it's time

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.880
to start narrowing down
and making hard choices.

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.820
So the decide phase is all
about those hard decisions

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:10.210
and selecting what you're
going to prototype with users.

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.100
Once you've narrowed
down, you want

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:15.080
to create a prototype that
you can test your hypothesis

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:18.580
and validate or invalidate
your assumptions.

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.860
Because you only have a
really short amount of time,

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:22.960
maybe you have a
couple hours, maybe you

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.790
have a day to build
that prototype,

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:27.700
it should only be
as high fidelity as

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:30.610
needed to answer your
questions, and nothing more.

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.160
Finally, we're
going to validate.

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.320
The goal of the test
phase is to confirm

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.060
that the product that
you have prototyped

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:43.360
is good, and also, that you
prototyped the right thing.

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.530
So today, we're going to discuss
two case studies to show you

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:50.550
how we've used this framework
to give users the tool

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:53.705
to engage in the ideation
and creation process.

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:59.440
And now that you understand
the structure of a sprint,

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.770
when's the right time to sprint?

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:04.620
Really, you can sprint at
any point in the lifecycle

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:05.940
of your product.

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:07.770
You might be at
the very beginning

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:10.770
and want to use the sprint
for visioning or creating

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:11.880
a roadmap.

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:13.590
You may have a mature
product, and you're

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:16.530
thinking about adding
a specific feature.

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:18.930
Whatever point in the
life cycle of your product

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:21.180
that you run a sprint,
it's important to remember

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:24.360
that involving users
early and often

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.520
can really help validate
the problem space

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:27.750
and create better ideas.

00:06:30.669 --> 00:06:32.710
And there are a couple of
outcomes from a sprint.

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:35.830
So I like to say
that there's never

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:39.270
a failed sprint because
you always learn something.

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:41.650
But we have to find
three potential outcomes.

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:43.870
And the first is an
efficient failure.

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:46.180
So it can be a
little dispiriting

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:49.390
that something didn't work,
but it's really useful to know.

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:53.500
And you've saved all of that
time, money, and resources

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:55.870
that you might have spent
building out the product

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:58.000
and then learning
that it didn't work.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.160
So you learned quickly.

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.500
Now, most sprints fit
in this middle bucket,

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:04.780
what we called flawed success.

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:07.290
Some things worked,
some things didn't.

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:09.010
But you have a path forward.

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:11.020
You know what you
need to do next.

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:12.730
And sometimes you
have an epic win.

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:14.980
Maybe you have a couple
things you want to tweak,

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:18.080
but you're ready to
move to production.

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:20.310
You'll need to set
your expectations

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:23.110
with its stakeholders at
the beginning of the sprint

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:24.910
so that everyone
is aware of this,

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:27.730
and they know what
the outcomes might be.

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:30.220
Now, let's talk a little
bit about immersion.

00:07:33.419 --> 00:07:34.790
SAMIR FALKE: Great.

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:39.600
So really comprehensive recap
of a very complex topic there.

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:41.390
And the reason that
we rushed through that

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:44.570
is because we are assuming
that if you're here, then

00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:46.760
you've heard of a
design sprint before.

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:50.420
You have most likely taken
part in a design sprint before,

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:54.030
and maybe some of you have even
run your own design sprints.

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:57.290
So we are going to jump
right into immersion.

00:07:57.290 --> 00:08:00.980
Now, before we talk
about immersive sprints,

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:04.020
let's try to understand what
immersion actually means.

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:08.150
So to think about
immersion, I went to Google

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:10.370
and I looked up the dictionary.

00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:14.110
And here's a definition
of the term immersion.

00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:17.360
Immersion is instruction
based on extensive exposure

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:21.050
to surroundings or conditions
that are native or pertinent

00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:22.780
to the object of study.

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:24.200
Now, this is a lot to take in.

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:25.880
So I kept googling.

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:28.970
Here's another
definition, much simpler.

00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:32.750
Immersion is a deep
mental involvement.

00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:34.460
Here's a third one.

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:37.280
Immersion is the state of being
deeply engaged or involved.

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:38.725
Absorption.

00:08:38.725 --> 00:08:40.850
All right, so there are
some common themes emerging

00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:43.100
from all of these definitions.

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:45.470
Let's bring this back to UX.

00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:48.260
How can immersion
guide your interaction

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.710
with users, especially users
that you don't know very well?

00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:56.180
I like to think of it
in terms of three steps.

00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:56.980
Step one.

00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:59.560
Immersion is about awareness.

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:03.220
So first, doing the
background research and study

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:05.350
that it actually
takes before you

00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:08.590
go into a new
environment and users.

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:11.320
Then, bringing those learnings
with you into these new

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:13.420
surroundings so that
they can provide you

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:17.216
the context that you need
to process that correctly.

00:09:17.216 --> 00:09:19.090
And then when you're in
this new environment,

00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:21.040
just being very keenly aware.

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:25.120
Observing without preconceived
notions, or bias, or judgment.

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:28.840
So that's awareness.

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:29.410
Step two.

00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:31.580
Immersion is about listening.

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:35.870
So you're going to hear a lot
of new sounds, process a lot

00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:36.670
of new sights.

00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:38.680
You're going to talk
to a lot of users

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:40.420
that you haven't
interacted with before.

00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:43.610
And these users are going to
tell you about their lives,

00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:47.020
about their problems, problems
that you haven't faced before.

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:50.775
So it's really important
to listen attentively.

00:09:50.775 --> 00:09:52.400
And this is actually
pretty hard to do.

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:54.970
If you tried
yourself, right now,

00:09:54.970 --> 00:09:57.280
when you try to listen
to someone speaking,

00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:00.910
it's very easy to let your mind
wander and think about what

00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:02.300
you want to say next.

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:04.150
It's very hard to
mindfully listen.

00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:05.566
I hope that's not
what you all are

00:10:05.566 --> 00:10:06.770
doing right now, by the way.

00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:10.750
But it's really important
to listen attentively.

00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:12.760
So that's step two.

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:15.310
And then step three
is taking awareness,

00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:17.746
and taking listening, and
bringing it to empathy.

00:10:17.746 --> 00:10:19.120
And this is when
you are actually

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:21.970
stepping into someone's
shoes and experiencing

00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:23.530
what they experience.

00:10:23.530 --> 00:10:26.710
Understanding their
needs, their pain points,

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:30.610
their hopes and dreams, and
even things that delight them.

00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:34.780
So when you have awareness,
listening, empathy,

00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:36.630
all of these three
things together,

00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:39.250
that's going to be
considered immersion.

00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:44.740
So how does this relate to
design sprints and design?

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:48.250
Now, when you're in a design
sprint, you are making a call,

00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:51.280
and you are designing
solutions for users

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:54.190
based on what you think is
going to work well for them.

00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:56.060
Now, where does this come from?

00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:59.440
It comes from intuition.

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:01.780
And how does
intuition get built?

00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:04.600
It comes from a
lifetime of experience.

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:07.270
It comes from
knowledge and study.

00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:10.120
It comes from trial and
error, like launching

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:12.340
a lot of designs, and
seeing what works,

00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:14.890
and learning from success,
learning from failure.

00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:18.480
It's a constant loop of
learning and tweaking.

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:20.200
But when you're
designing for users

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:22.960
that you've never
interacted with before,

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:25.240
you don't have this intuition.

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:27.610
So what happens in the
context of a sprint?

00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:30.190
All of this gets amplified.

00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:33.610
In a sprint, you're time-boxed,
so you're doing things really

00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:35.260
fast.

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.690
It's a high pressure situation.

00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:40.120
It's not just you,
but probably you

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:43.000
and a bunch of sprinters who
are all in the same boat as you.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.580
You don't understand
your user really well.

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:49.000
So Burgan and I are often
placed in situations like this

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.270
because we both work
on products where

00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:52.990
we are distant from our users.

00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:55.450
We don't understand our
users very well, that often.

00:11:55.450 --> 00:11:56.470
So what happens?

00:11:56.470 --> 00:12:00.190
You've seen that in
sprints like this,

00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:03.610
there is analysis paralysis
because your sprinters are not

00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:07.750
confident about deciding how to
move forward with your design.

00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:10.480
You end up making safe choices.

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:12.930
So your design solutions
are not strong.

00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:14.620
Sprint outcomes suffer.

00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:16.810
You just don't see that
big leap that you want

00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:19.120
to see at the end of a sprint.

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:23.770
So we need to help you and
your sprinters build intuition.

00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:26.060
How do we do this?

00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:31.930
So we think immersion is a
great solution to doing this.

00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:34.030
Good design in sprints
is about making

00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:36.430
educated and informed
decisions about how

00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:39.310
to solve a problem that
your users are facing.

00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:41.050
So with immersion,
you're helping

00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:43.450
your sprinters
gain the foundation

00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:47.890
to confidently design solutions.

00:12:47.890 --> 00:12:49.890
So let's bring it all together.

00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:52.920
Immersive sprints create
a realistic environment

00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:56.280
to guide your sprinters,
drive great outcomes,

00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:58.650
and then validate
sprint outcomes.

00:12:58.650 --> 00:13:00.870
If you don't understand
your users really well

00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:02.790
and you want to design
solutions for them

00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:05.100
in a fast-paced
sprint environment,

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:07.542
then immersion is
a great technique

00:13:07.542 --> 00:13:08.625
to set you up for success.

00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:13.080
So how do we do this?

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:15.038
We are going to go over
a few techniques today.

00:13:15.038 --> 00:13:18.590
First, we're going to talk
about doing pre- and post-sprint

00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:20.750
research, so actually
incorporating research

00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:22.550
as part of your sprint.

00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:27.440
Then, creating immersion during
the design sprint itself.

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:29.750
Third, participate
redesign sprint.

00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:32.060
So this is when you're
co-designing with their users.

00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:34.476
You actually ask your users
to come to the sprint with you

00:13:34.476 --> 00:13:36.830
and take part in
it as a sprinter.

00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:41.650
And then last, instead of saving
validation for the last stage,

00:13:41.650 --> 00:13:45.290
incorporate validation at
every stage of the sprint.

00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:47.270
Make sure that you
check in with your users

00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:49.010
at the end of each
day so that you

00:13:49.010 --> 00:13:51.680
know you're on the right path.

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:53.780
So to give you an understanding
of how all of this

00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:55.700
works in practice,
we're going to walk

00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:58.520
through two case studies
of successful sprints

00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:00.167
that Burgan and I have run.

00:14:00.167 --> 00:14:02.000
So first, I'm going to
hand it off to Burgan

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.874
to talk about a really
interesting sprint she

00:14:03.874 --> 00:14:05.849
ran in Kenya.

00:14:05.849 --> 00:14:06.890
BURGAN SHEALY: All right.

00:14:06.890 --> 00:14:10.760
I'm excited to tell you
guys about a sprint I ran

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:12.900
with an app called Afriscout.

00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:15.020
Now, we were
kicking off this app

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:19.670
to help herders survive
ongoing drought.

00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:23.450
Now, pastoralists are nomadic
or semi-nomadic people

00:14:23.450 --> 00:14:25.730
who move their livestock
between pastures

00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:27.620
depending on the season.

00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:30.020
And now, with the emergence
of climate change,

00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:33.230
rainfall patterns have
shifted, forcing herders

00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:35.840
to find new routes,
new pastures,

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:37.850
and new sources of water.

00:14:37.850 --> 00:14:42.590
And their traditional methods
of finding good grazing lands,

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:46.790
like word of mouth, scouting,
ancestral knowledge,

00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:50.300
have proven insufficient
to maintain healthy herds

00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:54.120
in this changing landscape.

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:57.150
An organization called
Project Concern International,

00:14:57.150 --> 00:15:01.500
a nonprofit based in San
Diego and a Google.org grantee

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:06.270
created a program that relayed
satellite data to pastoralists

00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:09.450
that showed current
vegetative conditions.

00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:12.570
Now, this gave the pastoralists
critical intelligence

00:15:12.570 --> 00:15:15.390
about where to move their herds.

00:15:15.390 --> 00:15:17.550
The proof of concept
was highly successful.

00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:21.330
We saw 50% reduction
in herd mortality,

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:24.990
and an 80% adoption rate
in the local populations

00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:26.670
that it was tested with.

00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:30.810
But the delivery system was
cumbersome and inefficient.

00:15:30.810 --> 00:15:33.690
The maps were auto-emailed
to the PCI field

00:15:33.690 --> 00:15:36.870
staff who would print
them out, deliver them

00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:40.710
to district livestock officers
who would then pass them

00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:42.630
on to the locals.

00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:47.460
So this process was slow
and difficult to scale.

00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:50.460
So our question was, would
it be possible for us

00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:54.480
to cut out those middlemen
and simply deliver them maps

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:59.370
from the satellite
straight to smartphones?

00:15:59.370 --> 00:16:03.100
As we planned the sprint,
we recognize the difficulty

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:06.850
in properly understanding
the cultural, societal,

00:16:06.850 --> 00:16:10.570
and usage scenarios encountered
by populations so different

00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:12.130
from ourselves.

00:16:12.130 --> 00:16:14.860
But we knew that the
community, as experts

00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:18.670
of their own experience, would
have the historical context

00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:20.950
and the knowledge of
what was and wasn't

00:16:20.950 --> 00:16:22.900
important to the community.

00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:25.450
So rather than just
consult the community,

00:16:25.450 --> 00:16:27.940
we decided to involve it.

00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:29.920
Now, as designers
and developers,

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:33.280
we often create
products for people.

00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:37.540
Co-design is the act of creating
with stakeholders and users,

00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:40.780
ensuring that the people most
affected by the solutions

00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:43.280
are part of the
development process.

00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:46.180
And this is really based
on the idea and the belief

00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:49.640
that all people are creative.

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:52.090
Now, the design sprint
gives us a framework

00:16:52.090 --> 00:16:54.040
to put this into practice.

00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:56.140
And through the
sprint process, we

00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:59.980
can guide users through the
ideation and creation process

00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:01.675
to really give voice
to their ideas.

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:07.420
As you can imagine, we had a
lot of different perspectives

00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:08.470
around this challenge.

00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:10.839
So we had to build
the right sprint team.

00:17:10.839 --> 00:17:13.839
And we had quite a
large team with a number

00:17:13.839 --> 00:17:15.520
of diverse stakeholders.

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:19.750
We had our geographic
information systems specialist,

00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:21.670
who was our mapping specialist.

00:17:21.670 --> 00:17:24.130
We had local developers
and a UX researcher

00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:28.280
from iHub, which is a
incubation space and in Nairobi.

00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:31.010
We had two staffers
from PCI in San Diego,

00:17:31.010 --> 00:17:33.610
and we had UX
designers from Google.

00:17:33.610 --> 00:17:36.790
But most importantly,
we had two pastoralists

00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:39.370
from different
districts in Tanzania.

00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:41.980
And then we had
three PCI field staff

00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:45.310
from Ethiopia and Tanzania,
who worked directly

00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:46.930
with the pastoralists
and had been

00:17:46.930 --> 00:17:50.000
part of this proof
of concept program.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.940
So it was important
to us that this app

00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:55.580
transcended geographic
and tribal boundaries.

00:17:55.580 --> 00:17:57.700
Now, this team required
the integration

00:17:57.700 --> 00:18:01.280
of experts and users really
working closely together.

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:04.180
So empathy between our
participants was essential,

00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:06.640
and face-to-face
communication was best.

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:12.010
So we all gathered in
iHub's office in Nairobi.

00:18:12.010 --> 00:18:15.530
Now, co-creation can be applied
at any stage of the design

00:18:15.530 --> 00:18:18.844
development process through
different activities.

00:18:18.844 --> 00:18:20.260
And as we created
the schedule, we

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:23.170
thought deeply about
how to include our users

00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:25.570
at each stage of this process.

00:18:25.570 --> 00:18:27.340
And by incorporating
user feedback

00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:31.810
throughout this process, we
can avoid the anchoring effect,

00:18:31.810 --> 00:18:35.620
where we're going to really
see that human tendency

00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:38.470
to rely on that first
piece of information

00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:41.560
to make subsequent judgments.

00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:44.680
So during the understand
phase, our users

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:46.510
helped us understand
the problems phase

00:18:46.510 --> 00:18:49.660
through lightning talks,
and documenting and sharing

00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:50.900
[INAUDIBLE] ways.

00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:53.500
Now, you can see, some of
the topics that we discussed

00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:57.310
were technical infrastructure,
offline experience,

00:18:57.310 --> 00:19:00.100
battery life, traditional
decision-making,

00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:01.810
so it was really
important to users

00:19:01.810 --> 00:19:03.670
that these maps worked offline.

00:19:03.670 --> 00:19:05.902
They were not always connected.

00:19:05.902 --> 00:19:07.360
And traditional
decision-making was

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:09.193
something I don't think
we would have talked

00:19:09.193 --> 00:19:12.100
about if we had run this
sprint in San Diego or here

00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:14.050
in Mountain View.

00:19:14.050 --> 00:19:15.820
It really is something that--

00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:18.520
we learned the elders make
a lot of the decisions

00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:20.770
around where to move the herds.

00:19:20.770 --> 00:19:24.040
But the younger generation are
the one with the smartphone.

00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:27.250
So we had to take those types
of things into consideration

00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:28.420
as we considered the design.

00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:33.350
So to make the
pastoralists' experience

00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:36.110
resonate with all of
the sprint team members,

00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:39.699
we broke into groups and
created user journey maps.

00:19:39.699 --> 00:19:41.490
These were really
important, because people

00:19:41.490 --> 00:19:43.310
are good at thinking
in terms of stories

00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:46.440
about people and the
things that they do,

00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:47.630
and what happens to them.

00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:51.200
And stories can be useful
in generative design

00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:53.900
to invoke empathy
and imagination,

00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:58.340
and trigger ideas for
a more ideal future.

00:19:58.340 --> 00:20:00.290
We used crazy eights
to allow the team

00:20:00.290 --> 00:20:03.740
to generate a ton of different
ideas based on everything

00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:05.930
we learned in the
understand phase.

00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:08.030
And to help our users
with this activity,

00:20:08.030 --> 00:20:10.220
we really gave some
structure to it

00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:12.560
by giving them props
to sketch around.

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:14.060
So we did this in four phases.

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:18.890
And during the decide
phase, we really

00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:22.070
gave our users more power in
the decision-making process

00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:26.840
with extra votes, and we
reminded our other participants

00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:29.360
to evaluate each
idea, considering

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:32.870
what our audience experienced
and what they wanted.

00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:37.710
So depending on the level
of the fidelity that you're

00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:40.980
aiming for, one of the
most difficult phases

00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:45.450
to incorporate users in can
be the prototyping phase.

00:20:45.450 --> 00:20:48.160
Paper prototypes might be
the most inclusive way.

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:49.860
And those are totally OK.

00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:52.510
We were aiming for a
little bit higher fidelity.

00:20:52.510 --> 00:20:56.160
And so we considered letting
our users go during this phase.

00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:58.620
But they actually
wanted to stay.

00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:02.970
And their participation
actually proved crucial.

00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:06.480
When the designers were
designing this middle screen,

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:09.420
they were struggling to
come up with iconography

00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:12.150
that would really represent
some of the diverse ideas

00:21:12.150 --> 00:21:14.210
that we were trying
to get across.

00:21:14.210 --> 00:21:16.500
This location has no water.

00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:19.980
Or scary animals were
cited in this location.

00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:23.010
Maybe you shouldn't
take your herd there.

00:21:23.010 --> 00:21:25.500
But we were able
to rapidly iterate,

00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:27.960
and show our designs
to the users,

00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:31.530
and get immediate feedback, so
that we were able to confirm

00:21:31.530 --> 00:21:34.030
which icons resonated
and which ones didn't.

00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:40.330
So for use or testing, it was
important to solicit feedback

00:21:40.330 --> 00:21:42.910
from a larger and
more diverse group

00:21:42.910 --> 00:21:44.770
than was just the sprint team.

00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:46.780
If you'll remember,
we had sprinters

00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:49.000
from Ethiopia and Tanzania.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.030
But we were in Kenya, so we
were able to go about an hour

00:21:52.030 --> 00:21:56.020
south of Nairobi and
test our prototype

00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:57.940
with a group of Maasai.

00:21:57.940 --> 00:21:59.800
And this proved
extremely valuable,

00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:03.150
as we saw the validity
of this tool immediately

00:22:03.150 --> 00:22:04.900
and that the approach
we chose would

00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:08.810
transcend geographic
and tribal boundaries.

00:22:08.810 --> 00:22:12.160
Now, the spring process allowed
us to find common ground,

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:15.520
to share ideas, and
develop a common language

00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:17.530
and work together
to fully understand

00:22:17.530 --> 00:22:20.370
the user needs from the
very outset of the project.

00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:25.500
Next, we're going to
talk about a case study

00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:28.879
that Samir did here at Google.

00:22:28.879 --> 00:22:29.670
SAMIR FALKE: Great.

00:22:29.670 --> 00:22:31.410
What an impactful sprint.

00:22:31.410 --> 00:22:32.494
So cool.

00:22:32.494 --> 00:22:34.410
All right, so I'm going
to switch gears a bit,

00:22:34.410 --> 00:22:36.701
and I'm going to talk about
the product that I work on,

00:22:36.701 --> 00:22:37.890
and that's Google Station.

00:22:37.890 --> 00:22:40.080
Now, just as a
recap, Google Station

00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:42.360
is a product that's
bringing high quality public

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:45.270
Wi-Fi to next billion
user markets worldwide.

00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:47.910
Now, a little bit of a caveat.

00:22:47.910 --> 00:22:50.100
I can't really talk
about the actual product

00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:52.200
that we were designing
in the sprint,

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:53.820
but I can talk
about the process.

00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:56.340
And that's what I'm
going to do here.

00:22:56.340 --> 00:23:01.440
So a while ago, someone in our
team had this really cool idea.

00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:03.780
They wanted to bring
in the features that

00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:06.360
are present in a
different Google product

00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:08.450
into Google Station.

00:23:08.450 --> 00:23:10.400
He got super excited.

00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:13.860
We talked to this team, and
that team got super excited.

00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:16.890
And we were all ready
to have this happen,

00:23:16.890 --> 00:23:18.420
but we didn't know how.

00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:21.390
So we didn't know what this
experience would look like.

00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:24.810
A great reason to have a sprint.

00:23:24.810 --> 00:23:26.760
We also had never worked
together as a team.

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:29.167
So there was no
working relationship.

00:23:29.167 --> 00:23:31.750
Another great reason to have a
sprint, to bring teams together

00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:34.560
so they can establish trust.

00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:36.360
Now, here's another challenge.

00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:39.840
The Google Station team is
based largely in Mountain View.

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:42.900
This other product
is based in Asia.

00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:45.780
And at the time, the user
that we were designing for

00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:47.380
was in India.

00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:49.550
So three different countries.

00:23:49.550 --> 00:23:52.860
Really challenging.

00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:56.290
And going back to the slide
that Burgan showed earlier,

00:23:56.290 --> 00:23:58.110
we had an answer, from
the business side,

00:23:58.110 --> 00:23:59.980
how this product would work.

00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:02.280
And we also knew that, from
an engineering standpoint,

00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:04.560
we could most
likely make it work.

00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:07.020
But what we didn't know
is, is this something

00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:09.180
that our users even care about?

00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:12.160
We didn't know if this was
desirable for our users.

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:15.340
So this big gap was something
we needed to address.

00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:17.800
So we decided that we should
run an immersive sprint.

00:24:20.550 --> 00:24:24.690
So the sprint challenge was
design an experience aligned

00:24:24.690 --> 00:24:27.480
with user needs that would
combine functionality

00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:31.120
of two products in
a very seamless way.

00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:33.270
But before we could even
talk about seamless,

00:24:33.270 --> 00:24:36.360
and the interaction
design, and all of that,

00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:38.340
I really wanted
us to figure out,

00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:40.810
does this make
sense for our users?

00:24:40.810 --> 00:24:45.000
So I flexed the standard five
phase methodology of the sprint

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.210
and added an extra phase which
is that orange circle you

00:24:48.210 --> 00:24:50.070
see here, for strategy.

00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:52.320
We wanted to figure
out, is there

00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:57.180
a strong user focused product
strategy for this product?

00:24:57.180 --> 00:24:58.150
And this was critical.

00:24:58.150 --> 00:25:00.210
We didn't know if this
would work for our users.

00:25:00.210 --> 00:25:01.876
And this product
strategy needed to come

00:25:01.876 --> 00:25:03.980
from actual user insights.

00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:06.510
We didn't know our
user that well.

00:25:06.510 --> 00:25:09.870
So we added two more
phases to the sprint.

00:25:09.870 --> 00:25:12.540
Before the sprint,
we added research.

00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:14.790
After the sprint,
we added research.

00:25:14.790 --> 00:25:16.780
Different kinds of
research, though.

00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:19.990
Before the sprint, we added
foundational research.

00:25:19.990 --> 00:25:21.450
And after the
sprint, we were going

00:25:21.450 --> 00:25:24.510
to validate the design
solutions we had come up with,

00:25:24.510 --> 00:25:26.620
with research to validate it.

00:25:26.620 --> 00:25:29.940
So that was also in
the field, but it was

00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:32.550
a different style of research.

00:25:32.550 --> 00:25:34.890
Now, this extended the
duration of the sprint.

00:25:34.890 --> 00:25:36.817
And we invited all of
our sprint participants

00:25:36.817 --> 00:25:38.400
to actually take
part in the research.

00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:39.900
We thought this was
really important

00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:42.720
because that would be an
immersive experience for them.

00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:44.550
And it would lay the
foundation for them

00:25:44.550 --> 00:25:47.340
to effectively
participate in the sprint

00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:50.830
and come up with great
design solutions.

00:25:50.830 --> 00:25:53.370
So this was also a lot of
overhead in terms of planning,

00:25:53.370 --> 00:25:56.130
because that meant
travel, going out

00:25:56.130 --> 00:25:59.980
into the field
for a large group.

00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:02.760
So to recap, understand
the user context

00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:04.560
doing foundational research.

00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:08.550
Use those user insights to
drive the entire sprint.

00:26:08.550 --> 00:26:11.730
And then, when you have
design solutions as outcomes,

00:26:11.730 --> 00:26:15.752
take them back into the field to
validate them with your users.

00:26:15.752 --> 00:26:17.460
So that was the process
that we followed.

00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:21.830
So how did we do this research?

00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:24.560
For both the pre- and
post-sprint research,

00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:27.420
we use a technique
known as intercepts.

00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:32.150
Now, by intercepts I mean
going out into the field,

00:26:32.150 --> 00:26:34.550
finding a user,
asking them if they

00:26:34.550 --> 00:26:36.440
can spend a few
minutes with you,

00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:38.750
and then doing an interview.

00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:40.910
And you can do an
interview and ask them

00:26:40.910 --> 00:26:42.680
about their habits,
and their lives,

00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:44.660
and you get a lot of
foundational information

00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:45.890
about them.

00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:47.900
Or you can show
them a prototype.

00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:50.630
And this could be a
clickable prototype,

00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:52.700
it could be a live
product, it could be

00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:54.630
sketches on a piece of paper.

00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:59.330
And you can ask them to use this
prototype to do certain tasks

00:26:59.330 --> 00:27:01.610
and observe how they do it.

00:27:01.610 --> 00:27:03.920
And this would be evaluative.

00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:07.340
So intercepts are really
flexible in that sense.

00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:09.560
You could use them for
different styles of research.

00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:13.020
And it's also in a user's
natural environment.

00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:14.990
So instead of
bringing a user to you

00:27:14.990 --> 00:27:16.760
and asking them
to come to a lab,

00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:18.120
you're going out to a user.

00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:20.870
So you're putting them at ease.

00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:23.930
And paper prototypes
are totally OK.

00:27:23.930 --> 00:27:26.330
So one of the things I
really love about intercepts

00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:28.440
is that they're really scrappy.

00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:31.310
You can put them together
in a really short time.

00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:33.290
And also, they're
cross-functional.

00:27:33.290 --> 00:27:36.830
This gives your team, your
non-user experience research

00:27:36.830 --> 00:27:39.920
and design team, your
VMs, your engineers,

00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:42.260
to take part in research
and actually come face

00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:43.790
to face with their users.

00:27:43.790 --> 00:27:46.160
It's amazing and
eye-opening for them.

00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:49.831
This is why I love intercepts.

00:27:49.831 --> 00:27:51.080
So that was the research part.

00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:53.750
Now, let's talk about
that strategy piece.

00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:57.040
To figure out if we had a right
user-focused product strategy,

00:27:57.040 --> 00:28:00.730
we used a technique known
as value prop canvas.

00:28:00.730 --> 00:28:02.720
So based on those
user insights, we

00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:05.600
asked users who were already
using Google Station.

00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:09.410
We made a list of all the
features in that product

00:28:09.410 --> 00:28:11.930
and what the pinpoints
of users were,

00:28:11.930 --> 00:28:13.880
using Google Station then.

00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:15.740
So we had all the user pains.

00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:17.750
Then, we made a list
of all of the gains

00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:20.330
that users are seeing
by using that product.

00:28:20.330 --> 00:28:22.660
So we knew the user gains.

00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:24.482
And then we went to the sprint.

00:28:24.482 --> 00:28:25.940
We went through a
lot of sketching,

00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:30.230
we diverged, we voted
on ideas, we converged.

00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:32.390
We came out with
a few solutions.

00:28:32.390 --> 00:28:34.550
We did the same with
those solutions.

00:28:34.550 --> 00:28:36.260
Are any of the features
in the solution

00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:39.140
going to relieve the pains
that users are facing?

00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:42.380
Are they going to boost the
gains that users are seeing?

00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:46.190
If both of these boxes map, then
you know what you're designing

00:28:46.190 --> 00:28:48.230
is great for your users.

00:28:48.230 --> 00:28:51.150
If they don't map, then
you have a problem.

00:28:51.150 --> 00:28:53.044
You don't have a strong
value proposition.

00:28:53.044 --> 00:28:55.460
And that's when you have to
decide whether this even makes

00:28:55.460 --> 00:28:58.190
sense to move forward with.

00:28:58.190 --> 00:29:00.980
So this is what we used for
exploring product strategy.

00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:06.030
So what did I learn
by running the sprint?

00:29:06.030 --> 00:29:10.120
First, the sequence of methods
that you use in a sprint

00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:11.676
really matters.

00:29:11.676 --> 00:29:13.300
And if I hadn't taken
the time to think

00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:16.330
about the sprint challenge and
add a product strategy piece,

00:29:16.330 --> 00:29:18.160
we wouldn't have
been successful.

00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:20.260
So think about the
sequence of products.

00:29:20.260 --> 00:29:22.210
Do a dry run.

00:29:22.210 --> 00:29:24.670
Try to see if one method
feeds into the other.

00:29:24.670 --> 00:29:26.684
Does the output
of one method feed

00:29:26.684 --> 00:29:27.850
into the input of the other?

00:29:27.850 --> 00:29:31.000
If there is a gap,
then address it.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.100
Make stakeholders your partners.

00:29:33.100 --> 00:29:35.614
Especially when you're running
a broad sprint like this,

00:29:35.614 --> 00:29:37.030
you want them to
be your partners.

00:29:37.030 --> 00:29:39.071
You want them to agree
with you, invest the time,

00:29:39.071 --> 00:29:40.465
and money, and resources.

00:29:40.465 --> 00:29:42.340
And you want to do daily
check-ins with them.

00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:43.764
Tell them how you're doing.

00:29:43.764 --> 00:29:44.680
What did you do today?

00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:46.330
What did you achieve as a team?

00:29:46.330 --> 00:29:47.170
Get feedback.

00:29:47.170 --> 00:29:49.150
Work on it.

00:29:49.150 --> 00:29:52.220
I've never run a sprint that has
always gone according to plan.

00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:54.940
So things go wrong,
people have questions,

00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:58.330
they question the very
premise of your sprint,

00:29:58.330 --> 00:30:02.380
things take too long to run,
methods don't go as you plan,

00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:03.870
logistical issues.

00:30:03.870 --> 00:30:05.080
So be nimble.

00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:05.740
Be agile.

00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:09.340
Be prepared to change
things around on the fly.

00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:12.070
One of the great side
benefits of the sprint

00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:14.360
is that you're bringing
two teams together

00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:16.240
who have not worked
together, and you're

00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:18.580
going to drive a lot of
alignment between them,

00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:20.794
and really strong working
relationship between them.

00:30:20.794 --> 00:30:22.960
So no matter what happens,
you're going to get that.

00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:25.250
And we got that.

00:30:25.250 --> 00:30:27.220
And then the last thing
I wanted to leave you

00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:30.160
at for this case
study is that this

00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:32.230
was a super successful
sprint for us,

00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:35.530
not because we figured out this
amazing new product that we

00:30:35.530 --> 00:30:37.390
wanted to launch.

00:30:37.390 --> 00:30:40.240
We actually learned that we
did not have a strong value

00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:42.790
proposition with this new idea.

00:30:42.790 --> 00:30:44.980
This did not make
sense for our users.

00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:46.990
At the end of the
sprint we decided

00:30:46.990 --> 00:30:49.370
we didn't want to move
forward with this.

00:30:49.370 --> 00:30:51.190
So the fact that
the sprint helped

00:30:51.190 --> 00:30:56.620
us understand very quickly if
the time, effort, and resources

00:30:56.620 --> 00:30:58.810
required to build
this was worth it,

00:30:58.810 --> 00:31:00.820
makes it super powerful for us.

00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:10.480
So you might be thinking,
I'm not going to Kenya.

00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:12.470
And I'm not going to India.

00:31:12.470 --> 00:31:14.620
Why does any of
this matter to me?

00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:18.980
Well, have you ever designed
for users in regions

00:31:18.980 --> 00:31:20.620
different from where you live?

00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:21.880
I bet you have.

00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:24.100
Have you ever designed
or developed solutions

00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:25.840
for users who are
different from you?

00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:29.470
Kids, the elderly,
minorities, people who

00:31:29.470 --> 00:31:31.570
are less tech savvy than you?

00:31:31.570 --> 00:31:34.390
I bet you have.

00:31:34.390 --> 00:31:37.310
And have you designed for use
cases you aren't familiar with?

00:31:37.310 --> 00:31:40.660
Have you made a product for
the automotive industry,

00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:45.470
or made a fitness app and
you've never been to the gym?

00:31:45.470 --> 00:31:46.470
We do this all the time.

00:31:46.470 --> 00:31:47.860
This is our job.

00:31:47.860 --> 00:31:53.440
Immersive sprints are
perfect for these use cases.

00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:56.470
And why they're powerful
is because you now

00:31:56.470 --> 00:32:00.700
have the opportunity to bring
your team with you to learn.

00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:03.070
Instead of doing
research in a silo

00:32:03.070 --> 00:32:05.500
and bringing a
research report back,

00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:07.660
you can take them with you.

00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:10.430
This is where the power of
sprints really shines through.

00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:13.510
They're cross-functional,
they're participatory,

00:32:13.510 --> 00:32:17.260
and they're democratic.

00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:21.660
So now I'm going to present some
tips to run your own immersive

00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:22.680
sprints with Burgan.

00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:30.250
So the very first one I went
over a little bit in advance.

00:32:30.250 --> 00:32:31.770
This is intercepts.

00:32:31.770 --> 00:32:34.280
Now, intercepts are a
great research methods.

00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:36.200
They're very scrappy and fast.

00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:39.360
They don't work well when you
need to recreate a lab setting.

00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:42.200
So if you're doing an
internet of things set up

00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:46.100
and you need hardware, you
want to recreate the home,

00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:47.300
intercepts don't work well.

00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:50.420
But if you have an app, if you
have paper prototypes, if you

00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:52.700
want to do foundational
research and talk to users

00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:56.180
and just learn about them,
intercepts are great.

00:32:56.180 --> 00:32:59.450
Now, it's important
to know that if you

00:32:59.450 --> 00:33:02.450
go in a large group of 10 people
trying to talk to one user,

00:33:02.450 --> 00:33:03.950
you're going to scare them off.

00:33:03.950 --> 00:33:05.510
So don't do that.

00:33:05.510 --> 00:33:08.180
Try to split up
into smaller groups.

00:33:08.180 --> 00:33:10.640
And then split up and talk
to people on your own,

00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:14.180
come back, regroup,
and share your notes.

00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:15.890
If you're doing
international research,

00:33:15.890 --> 00:33:18.830
there's a couple of
things to be aware of.

00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:22.200
Be aware of cultural nuances,
how to talk to people,

00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:24.260
how to address them, dressing.

00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:26.840
So do some research beforehand.

00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:29.840
Get good interpreters
or translators,

00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:32.990
because even if they speak
the same language as you,

00:33:32.990 --> 00:33:37.540
there might be important
nuances that you would miss.

00:33:37.540 --> 00:33:42.250
If it's possible, and if
your user is OK with it,

00:33:42.250 --> 00:33:44.930
ask them beforehand if
you can take a video.

00:33:44.930 --> 00:33:48.650
If they say yes, take a video
of your interaction with them.

00:33:48.650 --> 00:33:51.380
Because when you take a
video back to your team,

00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:54.560
it is super powerful, way more
powerful than a research report

00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:56.990
can be.

00:33:56.990 --> 00:34:00.890
Paper prototypes and focus
groups are OK for this.

00:34:00.890 --> 00:34:02.780
Because you're talking
to so many users,

00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:04.970
you'll correct for that.

00:34:04.970 --> 00:34:07.770
And then watch out
for selection bias.

00:34:07.770 --> 00:34:10.429
We have an idea in our
head of who our user is.

00:34:10.429 --> 00:34:12.710
So there is a bias
to go and talk

00:34:12.710 --> 00:34:16.429
to users that you think would
be likely users of your app.

00:34:16.429 --> 00:34:17.389
Don't do that.

00:34:17.389 --> 00:34:18.650
You're outside in the field.

00:34:18.650 --> 00:34:21.540
You have access to a
diverse range of users.

00:34:21.540 --> 00:34:23.760
So go talk to everyone.

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:25.460
And then one last tip.

00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:27.830
We try to make
sure that we don't

00:34:27.830 --> 00:34:30.260
prime our users to give
us answers that they

00:34:30.260 --> 00:34:31.940
think we want to hear.

00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:34.894
So we try not to tell them
that, hey I designed this.

00:34:34.894 --> 00:34:35.810
Give me your feedback.

00:34:35.810 --> 00:34:37.370
Because they'll be nice to
you and they'll tell you,

00:34:37.370 --> 00:34:39.710
this is amazing, even
if they don't like it.

00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:41.330
So we try to save
that information

00:34:41.330 --> 00:34:42.997
for after the interview.

00:34:45.622 --> 00:34:47.330
BURGAN SHEALY: Those
are some great tips.

00:34:47.330 --> 00:34:50.880
And a lot of them will
apply to co-design as well.

00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:53.300
Now, co-design is a
fundamental change

00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:57.230
in the relationship between
product creators and users.

00:34:57.230 --> 00:35:01.370
Traditionally, experts have
gone out and observed, done

00:35:01.370 --> 00:35:04.100
interviews, with
mostly passive users.

00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:07.970
In co-design, users are deeply
involved in the ideation

00:35:07.970 --> 00:35:10.050
and creation process.

00:35:10.050 --> 00:35:13.230
So you really want to prepare
your users in advance.

00:35:13.230 --> 00:35:16.130
Let them know what to
expect in the design sprint,

00:35:16.130 --> 00:35:17.690
talk about the
different activities

00:35:17.690 --> 00:35:19.580
that they might go
through, and help

00:35:19.580 --> 00:35:22.340
them reflect on
their experiences

00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:25.520
that they normally
perceive as routine.

00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:29.780
So perhaps you ask them to do a
diary study beforehand, or have

00:35:29.780 --> 00:35:32.390
them talk to other
members of their community

00:35:32.390 --> 00:35:35.240
to get a wider perspective.

00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:37.370
Logistics are also
quite important.

00:35:37.370 --> 00:35:39.590
You're going to want to
allow more time for each

00:35:39.590 --> 00:35:44.380
of the activities and more
time to explain them as well.

00:35:44.380 --> 00:35:45.500
Do you need a translator?

00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:48.920
Similar to intercepts,
it might be useful.

00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:51.620
Are you in the natural
context of the experience?

00:35:51.620 --> 00:35:54.830
Or are you asking the users
to come into your space?

00:35:54.830 --> 00:35:57.530
What would make them
more comfortable?

00:35:57.530 --> 00:36:00.290
What materials do you
need to allow your users

00:36:00.290 --> 00:36:05.580
to fully express themselves
and to take their ideas down?

00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:07.280
Are they comfortable
with drawing?

00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:10.190
Would they be more
comfortable if you gave them

00:36:10.190 --> 00:36:12.620
something to build with,
different components

00:36:12.620 --> 00:36:14.330
that they could put together?

00:36:14.330 --> 00:36:17.940
Would they be interested in
role-playing or storytelling?

00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:21.200
So really think through
all of the contingencies

00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:24.080
and the schedule of your sprint.

00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:26.275
Now, facilitation is
going to be key here,

00:36:26.275 --> 00:36:28.400
and you're going to be
switching roles a little bit

00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:31.190
from translator of
the user experience,

00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:34.400
to facilitating the
users, and guiding them

00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:36.650
through the creative process.

00:36:36.650 --> 00:36:42.741
And finally, make sure you
include a diverse and inclusive

00:36:42.741 --> 00:36:43.240
user set.

00:36:46.260 --> 00:36:47.249
And why do we do this?

00:36:47.249 --> 00:36:48.540
This sounds like a lot of work.

00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:50.990
So what are the
benefits of co-design?

00:36:50.990 --> 00:36:53.450
You're really going to
get an increased knowledge

00:36:53.450 --> 00:36:56.090
and empathy for the
user for the full team.

00:36:56.090 --> 00:36:56.960
And that's key.

00:36:56.960 --> 00:37:00.470
You're going to have all
your engineers, your PMs,

00:37:00.470 --> 00:37:02.720
face-to-face with the users.

00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:05.400
You're going to build better
and more innovative ideas.

00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:08.130
You're going to have
lots and lots of--

00:37:08.130 --> 00:37:10.160
more and better ideas.

00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:12.890
Your decision-making is
going to be more efficient,

00:37:12.890 --> 00:37:14.840
and your sprint
participants are going

00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:18.050
to be more confident in the
decisions that they make.

00:37:18.050 --> 00:37:20.090
And you're going to have
immediate validation

00:37:20.090 --> 00:37:23.960
of concepts and ideas, just as
I discussed with the iconography

00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:25.940
in our app for Afriscout.

00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:29.180
We were able to immediately
validate what worked and what

00:37:29.180 --> 00:37:30.230
didn't.

00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:33.650
And you'll be able to establish
a deeper and long term

00:37:33.650 --> 00:37:37.170
relationship with your users.

00:37:37.170 --> 00:37:40.790
Now, what if you can't bring
users in for the full sprint?

00:37:40.790 --> 00:37:42.030
Maybe they have to work.

00:37:42.030 --> 00:37:44.360
They're not able to
take that much time off

00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:48.200
to come in and participate
in your sprint.

00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:50.840
We also often do something
called extended user

00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:52.220
participation.

00:37:52.220 --> 00:37:55.190
So this is an alternative
where we bring users

00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:58.670
in at key milestones
within the sprint.

00:37:58.670 --> 00:38:01.650
So we'll recruit
users to do check-ins

00:38:01.650 --> 00:38:04.970
at critical milestones or
at the end of each phase.

00:38:04.970 --> 00:38:07.130
We'll do cognitive walkthroughs.

00:38:07.130 --> 00:38:10.092
We'll let them look at sketches.

00:38:10.092 --> 00:38:12.050
We'll just show them what
we've been working on

00:38:12.050 --> 00:38:13.920
and get their feedback.

00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:17.210
You might have to pivot,
but you'll want to plan time

00:38:17.210 --> 00:38:20.440
to act on the feedback
that they give you.

00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:25.160
Now, what if you just can't
bring your users to you at all

00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:26.910
and you can't go to them?

00:38:26.910 --> 00:38:30.150
What do we do then?

00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:32.790
SAMIR FALKE: So that's when
remote sprinting comes in.

00:38:32.790 --> 00:38:34.190
And we'll be honest with you.

00:38:34.190 --> 00:38:36.016
This has not been
very successful

00:38:36.016 --> 00:38:37.390
and we don't highly
recommend it.

00:38:37.390 --> 00:38:39.430
But sometimes it's unavoidable.

00:38:39.430 --> 00:38:41.900
Your users are far away,
you can't go to them.

00:38:41.900 --> 00:38:44.720
So you can use things
like slides or docs

00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:46.820
to collaborate remotely.

00:38:46.820 --> 00:38:49.220
You can use Google Forms
and send out a survey,

00:38:49.220 --> 00:38:53.130
and get your users to take
a survey to get insights.

00:38:53.130 --> 00:38:54.990
One of the things
that we've done,

00:38:54.990 --> 00:38:58.160
especially when you're doing
research from many time zones

00:38:58.160 --> 00:39:00.290
away, is overnight research.

00:39:00.290 --> 00:39:03.800
So an example was we
were doing a sprint here

00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:06.420
for a product that was
based in Indonesia.

00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:08.990
So we did a lot of work
all day, packaged it up,

00:39:08.990 --> 00:39:10.910
sent it over there.

00:39:10.910 --> 00:39:13.160
Researcher ran research
for us overnight,

00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:16.320
and we had feedback waiting
for us the next morning.

00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:17.510
So that was great.

00:39:17.510 --> 00:39:20.030
Obviously, this is very
situation specific.

00:39:20.030 --> 00:39:22.100
So if you can't do
this, you might want

00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:23.690
to consider taking a break.

00:39:23.690 --> 00:39:27.010
And instead of doing all five
days of the sprint in one go,

00:39:27.010 --> 00:39:28.760
do two days at a time.

00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:31.160
Break off, do some research,
come back, and then

00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:32.880
regroup the next week.

00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:36.470
So these are some techniques
for doing remote sprinting.

00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:39.520
So to recap, we talked
about intercepts.

00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:40.700
We talked about co-design.

00:39:40.700 --> 00:39:44.320
We talked about extended
user participation

00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:46.340
and remote sprinting.

00:39:46.340 --> 00:39:48.710
With that, we hope
that we've shown

00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:50.840
you the value of
immersive design sprints

00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:53.000
and given you the
right tools to run

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:56.460
your own successful
immersive sprint.

00:39:56.460 --> 00:39:58.350
Now, we'd love to hear from you.

00:39:58.350 --> 00:40:00.650
