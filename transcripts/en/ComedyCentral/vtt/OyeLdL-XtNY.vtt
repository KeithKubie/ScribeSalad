(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU KNOW, AFTER 16 --

00:00:02.501 --> 00:00:05.571 line:91%
I HAVE BEEN HERE 16 YEARS, 17
YEARS -- 16 AND A HALF YEARS.

00:00:05.604 --> 00:00:09.909 line:85%
I DON'T KNOW. I'VE SEEN IT ALL.

00:00:09.942 --> 00:00:10.510 align:start position:0% line:85%
FINANCIAL CRISIS.

00:00:10.543 --> 00:00:12.211 align:start position:0% line:85%
TO A WAR.

00:00:12.244 --> 00:00:13.846 align:start position:0% line:91%
TO ANOTHER WAR. TO WAR. TO
ANOTHER --

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:18.117 align:start position:0% line:91%
TO I THINK IT WAS LIKE FIVE
WARS.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.621 align:start position:0% line:91%
THERE'S NOT MUCH THAT CAN GET TO
ME ANYMORE.

00:00:21.654 --> 00:00:29.495 align:start position:0% line:85%
SO I THOUGHT.

00:00:29.528 --> 00:00:33.166 align:start position:0% line:91%
(LAUGHTER)
HE (BLEEP) KNEW!

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:37.070 align:start position:0% line:91%
HE KNEW THAT THE BALLS WERE
BEING DEFLATED!

00:00:37.103 --> 00:00:38.104 align:start position:0% line:85%
BRADY KNEW!

00:00:38.138 --> 00:00:42.542 align:start position:0% line:91%
BY THE WAY, THIS ISN'T JUST A
TABLOID SAYING THAT.

00:00:42.575 --> 00:00:43.943 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE "WALL STREET JOURNAL"
ALSO --

00:00:43.976 --> 00:00:48.347 align:start position:0% line:91%
(LAUGHTER)
THAT'S NOT REAL, ACTUALLY.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:56.422 line:85%
THE "NEW YORK TIMES" COVERED IT!

00:00:56.455 --> 00:00:58.391 align:start position:0% line:91%
AMONG OBLONG SPORTS EQUIPMENT, A
DEFLATION PROBLEM EMERGES.

00:00:58.424 --> 00:01:02.095 align:start position:0% line:91%
THEY REALLY DO TAKE THE FUN OUT
OF EVERYTHING, DON'T THEY?

00:01:02.128 --> 00:01:05.298 align:start size:94% position:6% line:91%
BY THE WAY, HOW DID DEFLATED
BALLS QUARTERLY

00:01:05.331 --> 00:01:06.332 align:start position:0% line:91%
COVER THIS STORY?
OH, THAT'S ODD.

00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:11.337 align:start position:0% line:91%
I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THIS WAS IN
THEIR WHEEL HOUSE.

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.974 align:start position:0% line:91%
SO TOM BRADY IN ALL OF
DEFLATEGATE, WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE

00:01:15.007 --> 00:01:18.344 align:start position:0% line:91%
HE KNEW THAT THEY WERE
DEFLATING THE BALLS.

00:01:18.377 --> 00:01:21.814 line:91%
WHAT DID TOM ACTUALLY KNOW ABOUT
THIS THING THAT IS ANOTHER WORD

00:01:21.847 --> 00:01:24.117 align:start position:0% line:85%
FOR TESTICLES?

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.620 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THE INDEPENDENT REPORT
CONCLUDES IT WAS MORE PROBABLE

00:01:27.653 --> 00:01:35.995 line:91%
THAN NOT THAT BRADY WAS AT LEAST
GENERALLY AWARE TEAM PERSONNEL

00:01:36.028 --> 00:01:37.029 align:start position:0% line:91%
WERE DEFLATING FOOTBALLS BEFORE
A CRITICAL PLAYOFF GAME.

00:01:37.062 --> 00:01:38.297 size:75% position:38% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: GENERALLY AWARE?
MORE PROBABLE THAN NOT?

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.864 line:91%
AFTER THE STORY BROKE, BRADY WAS
TEXTING THE BALL GUY LIKE HE WAS

00:01:38.897 --> 00:01:39.332 size:75% position:38% line:85%
A LATE NIGHT BOOTY CALL.

00:01:39.365 --> 00:01:41.134 align:start position:0% line:85%
WHAT ABOUT THIS?

00:01:41.167 --> 00:01:44.203 line:91%
&gt;&gt; THE WELLS REPORT SINGLES OUT
TWO LONG TIME MEMBERS OF THE

00:01:44.236 --> 00:01:46.539 align:start position:0% line:91%
PATRIOTS LOCKER ROOM STAFF AND
SOME OF THE MOST TELLING

00:01:46.572 --> 00:01:49.242 size:84% position:42% line:91%
EVIDENCE IS A TRAIL OF TEXT
MESSAGES BETWEEN THOSE TWO

00:01:49.275 --> 00:01:54.614 align:start position:0% line:91%
LOCKER ROOM ATTENDANTS, ONE OF
THEM CALLING HIMSELF THE

00:01:54.647 --> 00:01:57.917 align:start position:0% line:85%
DEFLATOR.

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.253 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: COME ON! HE CALLS
HIMSELF THE DEFLATOR!

00:02:00.286 --> 00:02:02.355 align:start position:0% line:91%
ONE OF THE GUYS IN THE LOCKER
ROOM AT THE BEHEST OF

00:02:02.388 --> 00:02:06.926 align:start position:0% line:91%
TOM BRADY CALLS HIMSELF
THE DEFLATOR!

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:07.493 align:start position:0% line:91%
WHAT WAS THE OTHER GUY'S
NICKNAME?

00:02:07.526 --> 00:02:09.328 size:75% position:38% line:85%
JOEY CHEATS AT FOOTBALL?

00:02:09.361 --> 00:02:15.601 align:start position:0% line:91%
WILL NONE OF THOMAS BRADY'S
TEAMMATES RISE TO DEFEND THEIR

00:02:15.634 --> 00:02:16.602 align:start position:0% line:85%
CHAMPION?

00:02:16.635 --> 00:02:18.204 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WHAT ABOUT ALL THE
FUNDRAISING FOR THE KIDS?

00:02:18.237 --> 00:02:21.774 line:91%
NO ONE EVER WANTS TO EXPAND ON
THAT, FOR THE KIDS, THE CHARITY

00:02:21.807 --> 00:02:22.908 align:start position:0% line:85%
EVENTS.

00:02:22.942 --> 00:02:27.747 line:91%
NO, THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT THE
STORY FOR THE DEFLATEGATE.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:34.353 align:start position:0% line:91%
(LAUGHTER)
&gt;&gt; Jon: THANK YOU.

00:02:34.386 --> 00:02:37.523 align:start position:0% line:85%
GRONK.

00:02:37.556 --> 00:02:41.294 align:start position:0% line:91%
FOR REMINDING US THAT THESE
ATHLETES LIVES ARE COMPLEX AND

00:02:41.327 --> 00:02:45.231 line:91%
THAT MUCH OF THE GOOD WORK THESE
ATHLETES DO IN THEIR COMMUNITIES

00:02:45.264 --> 00:02:50.469 align:start position:0% line:91%
GOES UNSUNG AND THAT OUR FOCUS
ON THEIR FOIBLES CAN REDUCE

00:02:50.502 --> 00:02:58.644 align:start position:0% line:91%
THESE ATHLETES TO
TWO-DIMENSIONAL THICK-SKULLED

00:02:58.677 --> 00:02:59.745 align:start position:0% line:85%
CARICATURES.

00:02:59.778 --> 00:03:00.613 align:start position:0% line:91%
I'M SORRY. I INTERRUPTED YOU,
THOUGH. YOU WERE SAYING?

00:03:00.646 --> 00:03:02.782 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, THESE SURE AREN'T
DEFLATING.

00:03:02.815 --> 00:03:04.850 size:78% position:39% line:85%
THESE ARE ONLY INFLATING.

00:03:04.883 --> 00:03:07.620 align:start position:0% line:91%
SO GET READY BECAUSE I'M GOING
TO BE READY.

00:03:07.653 --> 00:03:15.027 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND THERE IS ONLY ONE THING YOU
CAN DEFLATE -- THESE NUTS!

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:23.069 align:start position:0% line:91%
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
(LAUGHTER)

00:03:23.102 --> 00:03:26.639 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: YES, THESE NUTS,
INDEED...

00:03:26.672 --> 00:03:30.276 align:start position:0% line:91%
(LAUGHTER)
I GOTTA SAY, I LOVE THIS GUY.

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:31.043 align:start position:0% line:85%
BUT BRADY?

00:03:31.076 --> 00:03:32.812 align:start position:0% line:85%
NO.

00:03:32.845 --> 00:03:39.485 size:75% position:38% line:85%
MEET ME AT CAMERA THREE.

00:03:39.518 --> 00:03:40.019 align:start position:0% line:85%
TOMMY...

00:03:40.052 --> 00:03:42.622 align:start position:0% line:85%
YOU CHEATING (BLEEP).

00:03:42.655 --> 00:03:44.423 align:start position:0% line:85%
WHY!

00:03:44.456 --> 00:03:46.959 line:85%
YOU GOT FOUR SUPER BOWL RINGS.

00:03:46.992 --> 00:03:49.795 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU'RE MARRIED TO THE BIGGEST
SUPERMODEL IN THE WORLD!

00:03:49.828 --> 00:03:52.665 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOUR FACE -- YOUR BEAUTIFUL
FACE!

00:03:52.698 --> 00:03:59.438 line:91%
IS A WONDER OF SYMMETRY, A
PLATONIC IDEAL OF BEAUTY THAT

00:03:59.471 --> 00:04:02.408 align:start position:0% line:91%
CAN SURVIVE EVEN THE STUPIDEST
OF HAIRCUTS!

00:04:02.441 --> 00:04:03.509 align:start position:0% line:85%
(LAUGHTER)

00:04:03.542 --> 00:04:06.479 align:start position:0% line:91%
WHAT DID YOU WALK IN AND GO,
HOW YOU DOING TODAY, SAL?

00:04:06.512 --> 00:04:12.852 align:start position:0% line:91%
GIVE ME THE SOMETHING

00:04:12.885 --> 00:04:17.890 line:91%
AND YET EVEN WITH THESE DOPEY
(BLEEP) HAIRCUTS, YOU'RE STILL

00:04:17.923 --> 00:04:23.362 align:start position:0% line:91%
SO HANDSOME  I WOULD (BLEEP)
THE HOLE IN YOUR CHIN.

00:04:23.395 --> 00:04:25.431 align:start position:0% line:91%
(APPLAUSE)
SORRY.

00:04:25.464 --> 00:04:26.599 align:start position:0% line:85%
I WOULD!

00:04:26.632 --> 00:04:30.870 line:91%
BUT YOU, MY FRIEND, STOOD UP
THERE IN ONE OF AMERICA'S MOST

00:04:30.903 --> 00:04:35.374 line:91%
SACRED PLACES, THE PODIUM ROOM
BEFORE SUPER BOWL WEEK AND YOU

00:04:35.407 --> 00:04:36.575 align:start position:0% line:85%
LIED TO US!

00:04:36.608 --> 00:04:40.313 line:91%
&gt;&gt; ARE YOU COMFORTABLE WITHIN
YOURSELF THAT NOBODY ON SUNDAY

00:04:40.346 --> 00:04:42.515 line:91%
ON THE PATRIOTS' SIDE
DID ANYTHING WRONG?

00:04:42.548 --> 00:04:43.883 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF
ANYTHING.

00:04:43.916 --> 00:04:47.086 line:91%
I HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF ANY --
&gt;&gt; ARE YOU COMFORTABLE THAT

00:04:47.119 --> 00:04:48.087 size:81% position:41% line:85%
NOBODY DID ANYTHING WRONG?

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.955 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YEAH, I'M VERY COMFORTABLE
SAYING THAT.

00:04:49.988 --> 00:04:53.859 line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: WELL, FIRST OF ALL, IT
LOOKS TO ME LIKE YOU'RE HIDING

00:04:53.892 --> 00:04:54.527 align:start size:97% position:3% line:91%
SOMEONE ELSE'S HEAD UNDERNEATH
YOUR HAT.

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.662 align:start size:97% position:3%
(LAUGHTER)

00:04:56.695 --> 00:05:11.477 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT I'M GLAD YOU'RE SO AT EASE
WITH YOUR OWN DEVIOUS

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:12.511 align:start position:0% line:85%
MACHINATIONS.

00:05:12.545 --> 00:05:14.547 align:start size:91% position:9% line:91%
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU HAD AS
YOUR FRIEND GRONK SO

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.549 align:start size:88% position:13% line:91%
ELOQUENTLY PUT IT, THESE
NUTS TO SAY THAT.

00:05:16.582 --> 00:05:18.551 line:85%
I MEAN, WHY STOP AT DEFLATING?

00:05:18.584 --> 00:05:19.585 align:start position:0% line:91%
WHY NOT LACE THE BALL ON BOTH
SIDES.

00:05:19.618 --> 00:05:21.554 align:start position:0% line:91%
OR [BLEEP] IT, JUST START
Q.B.-ING ON STILTS?

00:05:21.587 --> 00:05:23.456 align:start position:0% line:91%
HOW MUCH IS ENOUGH, BRADY? HOW
MUCH IS ENOUGH?

00:05:23.489 --> 00:05:24.657 align:start position:0% line:91%
FOR GOD'S SAKES, YOU HAVE IT
ALL!

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:28.527 line:91%
IF YOU LOOK UP TALENT IN THE
DICTIONARY, GUESS WHOSE PICTURE

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.429 align:start position:0% line:85%
COMES UP!

00:05:30.462 --> 00:05:31.564 align:start position:0% line:91%
FRED ASTAIRE, THE MAN MOVED LIKE
AN ANGEL.

00:05:31.597 --> 00:05:33.432 align:start position:0%
HE WAS AN ANGEL.

00:05:33.465 --> 00:05:35.701 align:start position:0% line:91%
(LAUGHTER)
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, BRADY?

00:05:35.734 --> 00:05:36.936 align:start position:0% line:85%
YOU'RE GOOD, TOO.

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:40.539 align:start size:94% position:6% line:91%
THE GREAT ONES DON'T NEED TO
CHEAT.

00:05:40.572 --> 00:05:44.677 align:start position:0% line:91%
DID MICHAEL JORDAN CHEAT TO GET
HIS SIX CHAMPIONSHIPS?

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:45.878 align:start position:0% line:85%
NO.

00:05:45.911 --> 00:05:49.915 line:91%
IN FACT, MICHAEL JORDAN DECIDED
TO PLAY A SPORT HE SUCKED AT

00:05:49.948 --> 00:05:52.385 align:start position:0% line:91%
JUST TO GIVE OTHER PEOPLE
A CHANCE TO WIN A CHAMPIONSHIP.

00:05:52.418 --> 00:06:00.559 line:91%
HAND ME THAT BAT, JORDAN SAID,
I'M SURE I CAN FIGURE OUT HOW IT

00:06:00.592 --> 00:06:06.132 align:start position:0% line:91%
WORKS, AS HE GOT ON A BUS TO
BIRMINGHAM.

00:06:06.165 --> 00:06:09.201 line:91%
TOM, IF YOU COULDN'T SHOW SOME
INTEGRITY FOR YOURSELF AND THE

00:06:09.234 --> 00:06:12.371 line:91%
CHILDREN WHO WORSHIP YOU, AT
LEAST SHOW PRIDE IN YOUR TEAM.

00:06:12.404 --> 00:06:18.744 line:91%
YOU'RE A PATRIOT, TOM BRADY, A

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:35.027 line:91%
LET ME JUST SAY THIS -- FROM NOW
ON, WE AS A COUNTRY ARE GOING TO

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:39.832 align:start position:0% line:91%
BE WATCHING YOUR BALLS LIKE A
HAWK.

00:06:39.865 --> 00:06:45.371 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND NOT JUST THOSE BALLS --
THOSE NUTS AS WELL.

00:06:45.404 --> 00:06:47.540 align:start position:0% line:91%
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
AND BY THE WAY...

00:06:47.573 --> 00:06:51.343 line:91%
IF YOU THINK I WOULDN'T CHASTISE
YOU IF YOU HAD COMMITTED THESE

00:06:51.376 --> 00:06:57.483 align:start position:0% line:91%
ACTS WHILE IN MY TEAM IN A
NEW YORK GIANTS UNIFORM, IF YOU

00:06:57.516 --> 00:07:01.582 align:start position:0% line:91%
THINK I WOULDN'T CHASTISE YOU
FOR THAT, THAT WOULD BE CORRECT.
