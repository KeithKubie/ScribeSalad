00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.839
 in this capsule we will see the concept 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.370
 of dynamic Bezier network then in 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.900
 the capsules on the networks need 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.150
 dynamic we will obviously see the 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.009
 defining a dynamic Bezier network 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.230
 we will focus on two types of 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.800
 dynamic Bezier networks to know chen 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.779
 of markov is a model of kosher markov 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.760
 we discuss different types 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.710
 of inference that can be done in a 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.240
 dynamic Bezier network can we 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.189
 interesting to reason 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.850
 probabilistic in a dynamic context 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.700
 and we're going to look at 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:36.149
 different inference procedures in 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.579
 chest 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:44.809
 the particular case of mac os models 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:46.920
 hide then we saw the Bézian networks 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:48.809
 now here what we want 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.239
 to be interested in doing is to try to 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.399
 mobilize dynamic situations 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:57.120
 that is to say situations finally the 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:59.520
 notion of time passing and the notion 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.500
 we collect observations as 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.510
 and as time goes by 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.430
 so in this case also our model 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.740
 our beziers network is going to be dynamic 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.780
 as far as our random variable 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.799
 will be indicated by the time or 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.500
 associate these different variables 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.960
 then the dynamic changes that 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:23.280
 will enough to infer or model one will 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:25.439
 see it as a state sequence we're going 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.600
 see the random variables x you are 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.030
 so we see here that each variable 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.210
 random x is going to have a clue it's 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:36.240
 so a screen up aix grant is a 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:39.780
 great and that would be the end of a period 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.939
 that we try to model and so x that 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.409
 will match the non variables 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.579
 observables it's the notation that we're going 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.840
 use we will sometimes say the 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.220
 hidden variables 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.439
 it's the variables that will describe 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.570
 the state of my environment that 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.180
 I do not observe directly but that I 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.020
 would be interested a ferrer and will have some 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.229
 random variables 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:01.500
 m when we see clues and loses the 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.719
 try and that's going to be novara bhl who 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.040
 are going to be piqm in observe ie 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.530
 to do better than time will pass 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.569
 we will know the values ​​of separating at 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.900
 block we will be able to conditioned on these 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.590
 variables to try to infer the 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.150
 variables that do not 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.450
 interested in knowing the variables that 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.670
 are in the observe so that's for in 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.610
 set we use the word evidence for 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.080
 talk about this type of observation there 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.260
 again these variables are 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.360
 indicated by the tempt so the theme 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.430
 dynamic here in the Bézian networks that 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:36.390
 reflects the fact that we will actually have 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:38.340
 we will mobilize an environment where we 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.830
 know that the distribution of what we 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.060
 can observe from the state of 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.849
 the environment changes as and when 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.590
 as time passes and so the 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:48.569
 dynamism comes from the fact that we have a 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.910
 system that is dynamic whose 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:53.730
 distribution of the state evolve as 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.170
 as time passes and also 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.060
 we can recognize it by the structure 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.250
 of the network that will be distributed in 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.110
 time to say that as we will 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.959
 see rather or a bezier network that goes 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:09.660
 to extend unfair time what a complexion 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:11.970
 future then let's see some examples 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.879
 of applications with the little guns 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:17.160
 competent and approached with 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:18.540
 dynamic first Bezier networks that 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.209
 is really classic it's the one of the 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.639
 speech recognition in that 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:26.100
 if our observations nonverbal at what 

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:30.239
 i sava correspond squarely to the signal 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:33.540
 sound so the measures there signal 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:37.139
 sound that actually comes from the person 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.760
 who speaks and what is observed and who 

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:40.260
 wants to transfer the variables 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.590
 hidden maybe it's actually the words 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.069
 or the sentence that pronounced the father speaks 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.370
 to no one 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:50.340
 so in fact in systems of 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:52.799
 classical voice recognition which 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:56.180
 will be served if the signal and the state 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:59.130
 hidden actually going to be distributed 1 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:01.260
 different concepts have from the 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:04.200
 signal we often go incidentally 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.519
 of abstraction little bit more so a 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.930
 a little more abstract representation 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:08.459
 based on what are called phonemes 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.230
 that we can understand as being 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:13.470
 basically consonants and 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:17.090
 syllables pronounce from that we're going 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:18.930
 want a ferrer the words that have who 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:20.489
 match his fans love water 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.280
 that were pronounced for then 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:25.169
 build a very intelligible sentence 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.510
 which is presumably what the 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:29.770
 pair 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:32.320
 we tried to say so that all of this 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:35.200
 together often match to excite 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:40.450
 and what is observed is actually going to be 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:44.230
 the signal the machine translation or 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:46.780
 if it's an application we can 

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:49.750
 tried to model with networks 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:51.220
 bezina but in this case imagine it 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:54.370
 we want to do a translation of the 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:55.840
 French to English well what is 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.970
 observed it's going to be the words of the sentence 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:59.710
 in French that we try to translate and 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:03.250
 then what is hidden that we try 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:04.080
 to interest the words of the sentence in 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:06.460
 English 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:09.220
 so we have an example here that has been 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.810
 generated by google translate the 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:14.350
 paragraph here tiger is actually a 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:16.270
 body description and 215 at university 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:19.390
 from sherbrooke and you have here 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:21.520
 actually the generated translation so in 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:23.110
 this case we see a way to approach 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.380
 this problem no is to define a 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:27.910
 dynamic Beziers network where the 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:30.490
 observations hide it's going to be the words 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:33.390
 in English since it will be observed 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:33.390
 on têt the words in french 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:40.390
 third application is tracking 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:40.810
 of objects that is to say we have one 

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:43.720
 video 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:45.730
 and then we wish identified in a 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:48.400
 video of which he initiated a single frame 

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:50.230
 so every frame or clothes in 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:52.630
 English of the video be identified or 

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:54.460
 his 6th of the objects where are the objects 

00:05:52.630 --> 00:06:00.100
 when if the objects we are interested in 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:06:01.930
 it's the players in a game is 

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:04.990
 so what will be observed is going to be 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:08.290
 the pixels in each trams so 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:09.280
 you are in fiv at 1,10 and each of the trams 

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:11.400
 video 

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:13.000
 and then excited it'll be 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:14.620
 essentially random variable 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.880
 contains all the information about the 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:22.000
 position of each of the objects 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:23.800
 in the frame so it will contain 

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.260
 information on finally this 

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:28.810
 rectangle there that is around 

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:32.090
 different people in teeth 

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:33.370
 in the part you have a link here that 

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:35.540
 you will be able to visit the power a 

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:40.730
 demonstration of a tracking system 

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:43.280
 of objects and finally the localization 

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:45.440
 robots so 

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:48.530
 imagine that we have a rebound that is 

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:53.120
 represented here by the little circle and 

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:54.410
 who is in a building but who 

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:56.300
 do not know where he actually is so 

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:58.190
 all he has to determine his 

00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:00.950
 position it's the censors of lasers 

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:02.500
 who can launch the in all 

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:06.160
 directions to try to measure 

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:09.020
 what is the distance between the robot and 

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:11.240
 the different walls of the room in 

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:14.270
 all possible directions around 

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:16.160
 of him and so this information there that 

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:18.410
 would be what would be observed by the 

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:20.180
 robot and information hide the 

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:23.180
 knew to infer that would be the 

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:25.100
 robot position in the map 

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:26.750
 so we will assume that the robot access to 

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:28.940
 a map of the building to which he is 

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:31.730
 find he's just not where and from 

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:33.170
 of these censors as lasers there 

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:34.550
 let it wander as the 

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:35.930
 time flies by a ferry or is it 

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:36.950
 who is troubled in the map 

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:38.510
 so that's another example 

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:39.620
 application that we can try to 

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:42.190
 solve with Bezier networks 

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:42.190
 dynamic
