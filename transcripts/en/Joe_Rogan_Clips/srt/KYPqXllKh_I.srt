1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:05,490
The Joe Rogan experience.
I guess this is kind of my pet phrase.

2
00:00:05,491 --> 00:00:10,491
We are a species with Amnesia
is my favorite phrase of
we have forgotten so much

3
00:00:10,561 --> 00:00:12,960
more about ourselves than we remember.

4
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:16,680
And what the process of history and
archeology should really be about is a

5
00:00:16,681 --> 00:00:18,480
process of remembering.

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,520
We shouldn't be imposing our ideas of
what we should have been on the past.

7
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:26,790
We should allow the past
to speak for itself.

8
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:31,620
And when it does so it speaks eloquently.
Um,

9
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:36,680
one of the sites that we visited and
explored for America before was sip ant

10
00:00:38,581 --> 00:00:42,360
mound in Ohio. I don't know if
you've ever been there. Do you know?

11
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:46,750
I've heard of it though, is
an amazing Jamie's from Ohio.
You ever be there? Yeah.

12
00:00:46,751 --> 00:00:49,510
Danny and I were talking about it
earlier. There's seven man. There's a,

13
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,890
there's an aerial view of,
of uh,

14
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,540
that is Correy z.
Here's the thing you see is a beautiful,

15
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:59,460
you see the head end of separate man.

16
00:00:59,461 --> 00:01:04,461
They're so Santa and I went there
at the summer solstice in 2017.

17
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:07,560
We were there on June 21st,

18
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,880
2017 and my wife's aunt is a photographer
and we acquired a drone for this

19
00:01:11,881 --> 00:01:16,620
specific purpose and she flew the drone
up 400 feet above serpent mound and we

20
00:01:16,621 --> 00:01:21,621
sat it up there watching the sunset and
what happens on the summer solstice,

21
00:01:21,691 --> 00:01:24,000
and you can only see it
perfectly with a drone there.

22
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:26,100
There's pictures of it in
the, in the book here. Uh,

23
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:30,000
what happens on the summer solstice,
you can see it from ground level,

24
00:01:30,001 --> 00:01:32,310
but you get up 400 feet,
you really get it.

25
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:37,230
The head of that serpent is pointing
directly at a niche in the distant hills

26
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:42,390
through which the sunsets on the summer
solstice on the longest day of the year.

27
00:01:42,391 --> 00:01:47,040
So it's a, it's a sky ground
alignment perfection that is,

28
00:01:47,041 --> 00:01:49,140
that is taking place there.
It's a beautiful,

29
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:53,850
it's a beautiful thing to see to watch
that sun majestically sinking down into

30
00:01:53,851 --> 00:01:58,260
the horizon and see this awesome figure
of the serpent gazing directly at it

31
00:01:58,261 --> 00:02:02,730
with its jaws open almost as though
it's about to, about to swallow the sun.

32
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:08,120
And then we remember that there are other
sites around the world which are also

33
00:02:08,581 --> 00:02:13,530
aligned to key moments of the, of the
solar year aligned to the winter solstice.

34
00:02:13,531 --> 00:02:16,020
For example,
the Temple of Karnak in Upper Egypt.

35
00:02:16,021 --> 00:02:21,021
That kilometer long access targets
exactly the rising point of the sun on the

36
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,720
winter solstice. One of the interesting
things about serpent mound, uh,

37
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:31,320
and I urge anybody listening to this go
visit serpent mound and especially go

38
00:02:31,321 --> 00:02:33,660
there on the summer solstice
cause that's the moment.

39
00:02:33,661 --> 00:02:37,630
That's the marriage of heaven and earth.
That's when sky and ground unite in,

40
00:02:37,631 --> 00:02:42,010
in majesty at a, at, at,
at, at that place. Um,

41
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:46,140
but one of the mysteries
of serpent mound concerns,

42
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:50,850
how old is this mount? Really?
How, how, how far back does it go?

43
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:53,880
And there have been arguments that uh,

44
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,660
there are a group of archeologists who
would like it to be just a thousand years

45
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:00,460
old and they attributed to a culture
called the fort ancient culture.

46
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:04,540
There's another group of archeologists,
in my view, have done much more thorough,

47
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:07,900
thorough work who attributed
to the Edina culture.

48
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:11,860
The thing about which goes
back to 2,300 years ago or so,

49
00:03:11,861 --> 00:03:14,350
there's evidence for an earlier
construction enterprise.

50
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:19,380
It looks like the site has
been continuously reconstructed
and remodeled as we

51
00:03:20,171 --> 00:03:22,600
would do with any sacred site.
If it begins to wear down,

52
00:03:22,601 --> 00:03:26,980
you remodel it and then you get later
organic material being introduced to the

53
00:03:26,981 --> 00:03:30,340
site. That may give you the impression
that the site is only that old.

54
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:35,530
What's intriguing about serpent mound
is it stands on a natural rich and that

55
00:03:35,531 --> 00:03:40,150
natural ridge, and this is entirely
an accident of heaven and earth,

56
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:43,000
that Natural Ridge, the
head end of it, if you like,

57
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:46,510
is naturally oriented to
the summer solstice sunset.

58
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:52,600
Somebody a long time ago noticed that
natural orientation and they decided to

59
00:03:53,231 --> 00:03:54,250
monumentalize it.

60
00:03:54,251 --> 00:03:59,251
Here was a place where earth whispered
to sky the earth in her own nature,

61
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:04,900
looked directly at the place on the
horizon where the sun was setting.

62
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:08,140
This was a highly significant place.
This place mattered,

63
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:12,760
so they then created serpent mound
on top of it. They memorialized it.

64
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:14,080
They turned it into a,

65
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:19,320
into a special special place that human
beings had had a hand in making to honor

66
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,220
the marriage of heaven and earth.

67
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:26,260
And what I found researching this book
is that serpent mound is not alone in

68
00:04:26,261 --> 00:04:27,094
that respect.

69
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:31,540
A lot of people are pub puzzled
by Stonehenge in England.

70
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:37,020
A Stonehenge is built on Salisbury
plain and there are two kinds of big

71
00:04:37,721 --> 00:04:39,070
megaliths that Stonehenge,

72
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:43,420
one of them are called Saxons and
the other called the bluestones.

73
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,240
The bluestones we know for
sure were brought along way.

74
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,780
They were brought from Wales to
Stonehenge, a distance of about 150 miles.

75
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:55,290
The sausage ones are found in abundance
on a place called the Marlboro downs,

76
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,360
which is about 20 miles from Stonehenge.

77
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:02,550
But until very recently it was thought
there were no sauces on Salisbury plain

78
00:05:02,551 --> 00:05:07,551
at all and archeologists
couldn't understand why
Stonehenge wasn't built on the

79
00:05:08,111 --> 00:05:12,150
Marlboro downs weather, whether it's big
Sas and stones, the 20 to 30 10 mega,

80
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,830
we're available locally and
didn't have to be brought there.

81
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:16,420
Very recent research,

82
00:05:16,421 --> 00:05:21,421
2018 research has provided the answer
that two of those sauces were naturally in

83
00:05:21,551 --> 00:05:26,551
position all the time at at Stonehenge
and they are SAS and stone 16 and the

84
00:05:26,771 --> 00:05:27,604
heel stone.

85
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:32,410
And if you stand behind Saas and stone
16 and look at the heel stone at dawn on

86
00:05:32,411 --> 00:05:33,310
the summer solstice,

87
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,930
you see the sun rising in direct alignment
with the view and the heel stone is

88
00:05:37,931 --> 00:05:42,610
like the site on the barrel of a rifle
targeting the sun and that was there

89
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,370
naturally earth was speaking to sky.

90
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:48,580
The ancients saw that they
decided this was sacred.

91
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:52,020
They went to huge lengths
to bring the [inaudible].

92
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:55,480
The rest of the SAS is from the Marlboro
downs to create the big stone circle at

93
00:05:55,481 --> 00:05:58,130
Stonehenge and then to put
the bluestones inside it.

94
00:05:58,131 --> 00:06:03,131
But initially what they were celebrating
was a natural union of Heaven and

95
00:06:03,261 --> 00:06:06,050
earth. And that brings us
to the notion of as above.

96
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:09,980
So below that we are connected
to the cosmos, that it is,

97
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,690
that it is part of our heritage. We in
modern cities, forget the cosmos exists.

98
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:19,710
We have all kinds of tech that can look
at astronomy, astronomy programs. We can,

99
00:06:19,711 --> 00:06:22,790
we don't do that by actually looking
at the stars is something that's very

100
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:26,930
difficult for people who live in cities
to do where we're cut off from the

101
00:06:26,931 --> 00:06:29,360
cosmos. We're cut off from
the notion that it is sacred,

102
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,640
that it matters to the human creature.

103
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:35,540
And what what the ancients seem to have
had done is to realize how vital that

104
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:40,541
connection is and to memorialize it
and to celebrate it and to draw our

105
00:06:40,851 --> 00:06:45,140
attention to the intimate connection
between ground Scott. Yeah.

106
00:06:45,141 --> 00:06:49,550
Light pollution sort of fuels our infant
tile existence and a lot of ways, right?

107
00:06:49,551 --> 00:06:52,850
Because it doesn't constantly remind us
that we're a part of this great thing.
