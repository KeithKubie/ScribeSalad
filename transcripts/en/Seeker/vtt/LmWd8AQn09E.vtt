00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.990
This episode of DNews is brought to you by
Harry's.

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:07.799
Bathroom bacteria are gross, but they're not
even the worst in the house.

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:09.150
Are we going to gross you out today?

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.910
YES WE ARE, INTERNET.

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:14.490
Yes.

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.070
We.

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.650
Are.

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.130
Howdy friends, Trace here for DNews.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.970
Bacteria are on everything, your skin, the
floor, they even live in the damn air!

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:31.699
According to the journal Indoor Air[a], one
person adds 37 million bacteria to a room

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:32.930
every hour.

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.290
We stir it up when we walk through the room,
it falls off our skin and it's just… well…

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.290
everywhere!

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:39.290
There's no escape.

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:43.340
90 percent of the cells on your body are germ
cells, and that's completely normal.

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.530
When you think bacteria and a house most people
would head right for the toilet.

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.220
It has to be gross and bacteria-infected,
right?

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:50.220
Wrong.

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:55.010
In fact, toilets are often one of the cleanest
places around, simply because we THINK they're

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.500
so gross and therefore we clean them so much.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.890
In reality, according to research from the
Hygiene Council, funded by Lysol… yeah…

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.210
Found the kitchen drain, the garbage can,
the kitchen table and a home phone all contain

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.430
more bacteria than a toilet seat.

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.610
A study in the Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences found that your showerhead

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:18.180
incubates enough bacteria to create biofilm
-- literally a film of bacterial goo.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.310
It's not enough to infect you with anything,
but it's definitely gross.

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:27.030
Another study from Texas A&amp;M found 26 percent
of bathtubs contain staphylococcus -- or MRSA,

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.490
and ALL the whirlpool tubs they tested contained
fecal bacteria.

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.250
Maybe they should call them whirlpoop tubs!...

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.310
Right?

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.079
And although you might like it hot, that hot
water is not burning the bacteria; you're

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:42.310
just spreading them around.

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:48.020
You'd have to make the water hotter than your
skin can handle to actually kill bacteria.

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.240
Hot water on your dishes and hands doesn't
clean anything, but when paired with detergent,

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.880
it does help loosen dirt and oil.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.649
The hot water also dries faster, which is
good.

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:00.160
Because water on things is what encourages
bacterial growth.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:05.390
Basically, anywhere that gets wet and isn't
properly dried and cleaned will grow our microscopic

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.110
friends, and that includes things like the
bathroom -- and kitchen -- sink.

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.950
Seriously, that Hygiene Council study found
the Kitchen sink had almost 70 times the bacteria

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.010
growth of a child's training toilet!

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.010
In separate studies, TV remotes, computer
keyboards, and salt and pepper shakers were

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.930
all studied and found to be covered in bacteria.

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:31.680
A study from 1975 coined the AMAZING term
"toilet plume" for the bacteria and fecal

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.959
material spewed out of a unlidded commode
when it's flushed.

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:39.040
But a follow-up study last year in the American
Journal for Infection Control found no evidence

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.930
of toilet plume infection, but let's keep
toothbrushes in cabinets and drawers just

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.110
to be safe, mmmkay?

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.879
Researchers exploring the spread of infectious
diseases indoors caution that any implement

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:52.970
that comes in contact with your body will
ALSO contain bacteria.

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:54.659
We ARE covered in it, remember.

00:02:54.659 --> 00:03:00.910
So that means makeup, loofas, bags (like purses),
cell phones -- which are DISGUSTING -- and

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:01.910
so on.

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.720
If it comes in contact with blood, like a
razor, cuticle cutter, nail clipper, toothbrush

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.970
-- sometimes your gums bleed -- then you have
to be EXTRA careful, because then we're talking

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.459
about putting bacteria and viruses RIGHT INTO
YOUR BLOODSTREAM.

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:17.560
Basically, bacteria like places that are damp,
and when razors and toothbrushes are used

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.879
again and again, and left damp after every
use they become breeding grounds for bacteria!

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:25.030
With the razor, you can just change it.

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.129
Bacteria on a razor can cause folliculitis
-- or an infection of the hair follicles by

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:30.129
that bacteria.

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:31.239
It can get pretty serious.

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:33.129
So how can you avoid this bacteria?

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:37.700
Soak all surfaces in bleach and bathe toothbrushes
and razors in UV light?

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.299
Sure… but more practically, you can't avoid
it.

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:41.720
Bacteria are a normal part of life!

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.840
You're the cause of a lot of the bacteria
yourself, your mouth, your face, your body

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.090
and your hands are always covered in it.

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:53.000
Just keep calm, and know that most will cause
no issues with you whatsoever, and clean,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.700
dry, and replace things regularly keeping
in mind bacteria is growing on everything.

00:03:58.700 --> 00:03:59.910
Everything.

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:01.610
How often do you replace your toothbrush?

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:02.610
Your razor?

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:03.610
Your loofa?

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:04.610
Shower curtain?

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.049
Tell us in the comments and if you want new
razors for less try Harry's.

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:11.870
Harry's was started by two guys who thought
paying a crap-ton for crap blades was a horrible

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:12.870
experience.

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.480
They bought a German razor factory, and made
the experience of getting your razors cheaper,

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:17.480
and classier.

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.670
I love the packaging, and the blades are affordable
and nicely sharp!

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:24.540
