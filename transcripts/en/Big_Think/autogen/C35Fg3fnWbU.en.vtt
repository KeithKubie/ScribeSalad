really interesting project it was one of
these projects that never came to us it

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920
these projects that never came to us it
 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.109

I had just for years been collecting
 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.389
I had just for years been collecting
personality data on the web and and we

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399
personality data on the web and and we
 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.040
personality data on the web and and we
had you know literally hundreds of

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050
had you know literally hundreds of
 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.040

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.420
student was just you know he's just has
this intuitive knack for something was

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430
this intuitive knack for something was
 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.799
this intuitive knack for something was
interesting and he and we had never

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809
interesting and he and we had never
 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.959
interesting and he and we had never
thought of it he just thought okay let's

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969
thought of it he just thought okay let's
 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.150
thought of it he just thought okay let's
go and see if there are differences in

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160
go and see if there are differences in
 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.790
go and see if there are differences in
the states of personality and so then

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800
the states of personality and so then
 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.610
the states of personality and so then

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620
since we did find some differences he
 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.459
since we did find some differences he
started collecting zip code data so we

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469
started collecting zip code data so we
 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.229
started collecting zip code data so we
could get much more finely tuned

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239
could get much more finely tuned
 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:19.490
could get much more finely tuned

differences in neuroticism and that's

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220
differences in neuroticism and that's
 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.830
differences in neuroticism and that's
one of the ones that shows up most

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840
one of the ones that shows up most
 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.590

about you tend to find that but down the
coasts and then there's pretty much no

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750
coasts and then there's pretty much no
 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.060
coasts and then there's pretty much no
much going on in the middle with one or

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070
