00:00:00.055 --> 00:00:01.822
- [VOICEOVER] Let's see
if we can figure out what

00:00:01.822 --> 00:00:06.822
4/3 minus 1/5 is, and

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:10.377
if you think you know how to do it,

00:00:10.377 --> 00:00:12.984
I encourage you to pause
the video and give it a go.

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:15.821
So, when you first look
at this, the thing that

00:00:15.821 --> 00:00:16.724
might jump out at you is

00:00:16.724 --> 00:00:18.785
we have different denominators here.

00:00:18.795 --> 00:00:23.704
So, it's not obvious how to
subtract 1/5 from 4/3 when

00:00:23.704 --> 00:00:25.939
you have these different denominators and

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:28.418
the key is, is to rewrite each
of these fractions so that

00:00:28.418 --> 00:00:30.212
they have the same denominator.

00:00:30.693 --> 00:00:33.240
And how do we figure out what
that same denominator is?

00:00:33.599 --> 00:00:37.479
Well, it's going to be a common
multiple of three and five,

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:39.937
and, ideally, it's going to be
the least common multiple of

00:00:39.937 --> 00:00:41.502
three and five.

00:00:41.502 --> 00:00:42.768
So, how can we calculate that?

00:00:43.128 --> 00:00:45.017
Well, we can start with the
larger of the two numbers,

00:00:45.017 --> 00:00:47.739
say five, and let's go
through it's multiples and

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:51.239
see when we get to one that's
divisible perfectly by three.

00:00:51.538 --> 00:00:53.996
So, five is not divisible by three,

00:00:53.996 --> 00:00:57.804
10 is not divisible by three,
15 is divisible by three.

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:59.997
In fact, 15 is three times five.

00:01:00.168 --> 00:01:02.422
So, I can rewrite both
of these fractions as

00:01:02.422 --> 00:01:04.075
something over 15.

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.572
So, what's 4/3 if I were to
rewrite it as something over 15?

00:01:08.572 --> 00:01:11.743
Well, to get from three
to 15 in the denominator,

00:01:11.743 --> 00:01:16.339
we have to multiply by five.

00:01:16.984 --> 00:01:18.630
So, if you multiply the
denominator by five,

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.418
if you don't want to change
the value of the fraction,

00:01:20.418 --> 00:01:22.679
you have to multiply the
numerator by five as well.

00:01:23.425 --> 00:01:25.863
So, you have to multiply the
numerator by five as well,

00:01:25.863 --> 00:01:28.693
four times five is going to be 20.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.207
So, 4/3 is the same thing as 20/15.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:33.856
Alright.

00:01:34.073 --> 00:01:39.037
Now, how would we rewrite
1/5 and something over 15?

00:01:39.037 --> 00:01:41.197
So, we're going to have
15 in the denominator.

00:01:41.618 --> 00:01:45.808
Well, to go from five to 15,
we had to multiply by three.

00:01:46.757 --> 00:01:48.444
So, if we multiply the
denominator by three,

00:01:48.444 --> 00:01:50.584
we have to multiply the
numerator by three as well.

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:52.859
So, times three.

00:01:53.015 --> 00:01:54.667
One times three is just three.

00:01:55.087 --> 00:01:58.501
So, 4/3 minus 1/5, we can rewrite that as

00:01:58.501 --> 00:02:02.032
20/15 minus 3/15.

00:02:02.392 --> 00:02:04.450
Now, this becomes a lot
more straight forward.

00:02:04.606 --> 00:02:05.689
What is this going to be?

00:02:05.927 --> 00:02:07.857
Well, this is going to be a
certain number of fifteenths.

00:02:07.857 --> 00:02:09.342
We have 20/15 and we're

00:02:09.342 --> 00:02:11.762
taking away three of those fifteenths.

00:02:11.762 --> 00:02:13.688
So, we are going to have,

00:02:13.688 --> 00:02:16.024
if you have 20 of something and
you take away three of them,

00:02:16.024 --> 00:02:18.692
you're going to have 17 of those things.

00:02:18.727 --> 00:02:20.317
In this case, we're
talking about fifteenths.

00:02:20.616 --> 00:02:23.771
So, this is going to be 17/15.

00:02:24.476 --> 00:02:26.244
And if we wanted to write
it as a mixed number,

00:02:26.244 --> 00:02:28.946
we could say 15 goes into 17 one time with

00:02:28.946 --> 00:02:30.212
a remainder of two.

00:02:30.429 --> 00:02:35.265
So, it's one and 2/15.
Let's do another example.

00:02:35.265 --> 00:02:40.265
Let's see if we can figure
out what 7/10 minus 5/8 is.

00:02:48.223 --> 00:02:49.579
Five over eight.

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:51.677
And I encourage you to
pause this video and

00:02:51.687 --> 00:02:53.378
see if you can calculate it yourself.

00:02:53.442 --> 00:02:55.231
Well, just like we saw before,

00:02:55.231 --> 00:02:56.531
we have different denominators but

00:02:56.531 --> 00:02:59.090
we need to rewrite them so
they have a common denominator,

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:00.296
that way, we can subtract.

00:03:00.757 --> 00:03:05.734
And so, what's a common
multiple of 10 and eight and,

00:03:05.734 --> 00:03:07.122
ideally, the least common multiple.

00:03:07.217 --> 00:03:08.275
It doesn't have to be but

00:03:08.275 --> 00:03:09.702
it keeps things a little bit simpler.

00:03:09.899 --> 00:03:12.967
Well, let's start with the
larger of the two numbers and

00:03:12.967 --> 00:03:15.385
then keep finding in their multiples and

00:03:15.385 --> 00:03:18.575
find one that is perfectly
divisible by the other one,

00:03:18.575 --> 00:03:19.530
by eight.

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.536
So, ten isn't perfectly
divisible by eight, 20 isn't,

00:03:22.536 --> 00:03:25.347
30 isn't, 40 is.

00:03:26.011 --> 00:03:29.383
40 is a multiple of 10 and
it's a multiple of eight.

00:03:29.383 --> 00:03:31.644
In fact, it's the least common
multiple of 10 and eight.

00:03:31.964 --> 00:03:34.665
So, we can rewrite both
of these fractions as

00:03:34.665 --> 00:03:35.871
something over 40.

00:03:36.393 --> 00:03:40.010
So, that's going to be
something over 40 minus

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:41.681
something over 40.

00:03:42.245 --> 00:03:46.700
Minus something over 40
is equal to something.

00:03:47.303 --> 00:03:49.930
So, 7/10 is what over 40?

00:03:50.002 --> 00:03:54.492
Well, to go from 10 to
40 in the denominator,

00:03:54.492 --> 00:03:55.798
we multiplied by four.

00:03:56.198 --> 00:03:57.783
So, we have to do the same
thing in the numerator,

00:03:57.783 --> 00:04:01.407
multiply the numerator by
four. Seven times four is 28.

00:04:01.765 --> 00:04:04.494
So, 7/10 is the same thing as 28/40.

00:04:05.361 --> 00:04:07.400
Now, let's do the same thing
with the other fraction.

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:10.034
To go from eight to 40 in the denominator,

00:04:10.034 --> 00:04:11.646
we had to multiply the
denominator by five.

00:04:12.433 --> 00:04:14.144
Eight times five is 40.

00:04:14.443 --> 00:04:16.475
So, if we multiply the
denominator by five,

00:04:16.475 --> 00:04:18.960
we have to multiply the
numerator by five as well.

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:21.499
Five times five is 25.

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:25.942
So, 7/10 minus 5/8 is
the exact same things as

00:04:25.942 --> 00:04:30.942
28/40 minus 25/40 and now
this makes a lot of sense.

00:04:32.303 --> 00:04:34.197
It's going to be a certain
number of fortieths.

00:04:34.496 --> 00:04:39.231
If I have 28/40 and I take
away 25 of those fortieths,

00:04:39.231 --> 00:04:41.125
how many fortieths am
I going to have left?

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:43.808
Well, I'm going to 3/40 left.

00:04:43.966 --> 00:04:47.942
28/40 minus 25/40. So,
I'm going to have 3/40.

00:04:47.952 --> 00:04:52.952
28 minus 25 is three and we are done.

00:04:53.782 --> 00:04:58.409
7/10 minus 5/8 is 3/40.
