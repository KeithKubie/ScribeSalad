00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.760
When I'm mentoring young entrepreneurs,
I ask them about money and

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:05.070
their business model.

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:08.060
When I get an answer like,
we'll throw some ads here and

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:10.390
there, it makes me real sad.

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:12.140
It's the wrong answer.

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:15.605
You must have a solid business
model in place that will put

00:00:15.605 --> 00:00:17.997
your company on the profitable track.

00:00:17.997 --> 00:00:21.472
&gt;&gt; So, even if ads are the answer
to your monetization model,

00:00:21.472 --> 00:00:24.333
you need to put a little
bit more thought into it.

00:00:24.333 --> 00:00:27.940
So, let's define what an ad is first.

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:33.030
Basically, it's any public announcement
of something that someone wants to sell.

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:39.120
On the web we have ads in the form of
text, image, video or interactive media.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.590
The power of these ads is coming
from the fact that they are targeted

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:45.180
to site content and our audience.

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.430
You make ad spaces, also known as ad
inventory, available on your site.

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.910
Advertisers bid to show their ads on
your site and the highest bid wins.

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.490
Then you get paid when
users click on the ads.

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.120
&gt;&gt; This model works when
you have lucrative traffic,

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.140
meaning you focus on verticals that
advertisers are interested in.

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.050
For example, a finance or an automotive
site with a lot of users will earn

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.420
higher CPMs than a site that
focus on fish or white elephants.
