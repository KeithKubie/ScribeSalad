00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.760
In Ancient Rome tampons were made of wool,
Indonesians used vegetable fibers and Japanese

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:09.669
women used rolled up paper. The first commercial
tampons were launched in the 1930s and today

00:00:09.669 --> 00:00:14.809
women use up to 12,000 menstrual hygiene products
per lifetime. But is there a better option?

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:17.310
Should you stop wearing tampons?

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.390
Despite being a completely normal biological
process that half the population faces, menstruation

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:27.869
is often taboo. The menstrual cycle begins
every 28 days on average, and repeats from

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.429
puberty to menopause.

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.860
Every month, in response to the reproductive
hormones progesterone and estrogen, the lining

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.530
of the uterus grows and thickens preparing
for a potential pregnancy; however, if pregnancy

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.350
doesn’t occur, progesterone drops and the
thickened lining sheds.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.510
The menstrual flow is a combination of this
uterine lining and blood from the arteries

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.570
in your uterus, which is a unique trait as
few other species menstruate at all. In every

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.790
other mammal other than humans, primates,
bats and the adorable elephant shrew, the

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.079
endometrium only thickens in response to getting
pregnant.

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:06.270
During menstruation, 30-90ml of fluid is lost,
and 81% of women use tampons as the primary

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.920
method to absorb this blood, at times in combination
with pads. Tampons use exceptionally absorbent

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.520
materials like cotton and rayon that interact
strongly with water. And while cotton and

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:22.270
rayon are biodegradable, the rest of the tampon
isn’t, contributing to 300lbs of waste in

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:23.479
a woman’s lifetime.

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:28.400
The materials also provide an environment
that the bacteria staphylococcus like, which

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:33.979
can lead to a rare but potentially fatal disease
known as Toxic Shock Syndrome. As menstrual

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:38.520
blood adds neutralizing proteins to the vagina,
which is normally more acidic, it’s ability

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.869
to kill bacteria is reduced. In 1983 more
than 2,200 cases of Toxic Shock Syndrome were

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:51.040
reported to the CDC, but by 1997 there were
only 5 cases. This decrease is attributed

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.009
to education about tampons, like the need
to change it at least every 8 hours and using

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.890
the lowest absorbency for your flow. On top
of this, tampons can lead to vaginal dryness

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.409
and breakage in the skin, leaving you prone
to further infection.

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.720
On average women spend close to $100 on tampons
and pads a year, which are often taxed as

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.010
‘luxury goods’ despite being a basic necessity.
Protests have influenced governments like

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.500
Canada to remove the ‘Tampon Tax’ but
in many lower income nations, the high price

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:24.260
of tampons causes girls to miss school. In
South Africa, 9 million girls ages 13-19 miss

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.540
school because of a lack of menstrual hygiene
products or facilities to change them throughout

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:29.550
the day.

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.290
One alternative solution to tampons is a menstrual
cup. It’s a non-absorbent reusable barrier

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.890
cup that collects blood. The cost of the cup
is significantly less than tampons, and is

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.800
reusable for multiple years. It can also be
worn for 12 hours, meaning women can change

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.650
it home, as opposed to school or work, and
it creates substantially less environmental

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.530
waste. In a study where women aged 19-40 who
had previously used tampons as their main

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:58.830
method, were given menstrual cups for 3 cycles,
and 91% said they would continue to use the

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.940
cup and recommend it to others despite the
learning curve.

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.220
Period blood could also save your life! Scientists
are developing diagnostic tests that women

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:12.020
can use at home to monitor early signs of
cancer, reproductive diseases, STIs and endometriosis

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:16.330
using their menstrual blood. Additionally,
stem cells found in menstrual blood are more

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.860
powerful than those found in bone marrow.
These stem cells can differentiate into nine

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.740
different types of cells, meaning period blood
might provide a potentially unlimited, easily

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:31.090
collected, inexpensive and without ethical
dilemma, source of stem cells for regenerative

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:32.090
medicine!

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.890
From gross and taboo, to normal, to potentially
life saving, periods are pretty cool! Period.

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.450
