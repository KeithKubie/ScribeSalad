00:00:00.917 --> 00:00:03.380
- Wow, that is just a ridiculous,

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:05.706
crazy amount of dishes to choose from.

00:00:05.706 --> 00:00:07.645
This place is absolutely insane.

00:00:07.645 --> 00:00:09.162
This is curry heaven.

00:00:09.162 --> 00:00:11.378
There's so much to choose from,

00:00:11.378 --> 00:00:13.878
it's almost like overwhelming.

00:00:14.841 --> 00:00:17.424
(upbeat music)

00:00:20.894 --> 00:00:22.370
Good morning everyone, it's Mark Wiens

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:24.547
in Nakhon Si Thammarat
in southern Thailand.

00:00:24.547 --> 00:00:27.840
The plan for today is to go
to this restaurant right now

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.822
that serves, they have a,

00:00:29.822 --> 00:00:32.821
just a crazy amount of different curries,

00:00:32.821 --> 00:00:35.554
and after that we're gonna
go to a national park

00:00:35.554 --> 00:00:37.757
called Khao Luang National Park.

00:00:37.757 --> 00:00:40.905
That's the rough plan of the day.

00:00:40.905 --> 00:00:43.488
(upbeat music)

00:00:50.907 --> 00:00:52.378
We just made it to the restaurant

00:00:52.378 --> 00:00:55.658
and look at this amount of curries.

00:00:55.658 --> 00:00:56.844
That is ridiculous.

00:00:56.844 --> 00:00:59.406
That like, reaches to the end
of the horizon down there.

00:00:59.406 --> 00:01:01.147
I don't know if I've
ever seen so many curries

00:01:01.147 --> 00:01:03.315
in one restaurant ever.

00:01:03.315 --> 00:01:04.340
Just looking down the line,

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:08.507
there's just about everything
you could possibly imagine.

00:01:09.942 --> 00:01:13.985
Before I start eating and
show you all of the food,

00:01:13.985 --> 00:01:15.712
I want to do a quick walk through

00:01:15.712 --> 00:01:17.229
of the tables of food

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:18.435
and just all the way down,

00:01:18.435 --> 00:01:20.935
just so you can fully see the,

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:25.076
just the abundance of different
dishes that they have here.

00:01:25.076 --> 00:01:27.165
It's absolutely, it's breath taking,

00:01:27.165 --> 00:01:29.308
there's no other way to say
it than it's breath taking.

00:01:29.308 --> 00:01:30.383
Starting from this end

00:01:30.383 --> 00:01:32.264
we've got all the different
types of fried fish.

00:01:32.264 --> 00:01:35.213
Then moving on you move into the curries.

00:01:35.213 --> 00:01:38.953
There are a couple of salads mixed in.

00:01:38.953 --> 00:01:41.119
Curries, curries, curries.

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:43.502
More and more curries.

00:01:43.502 --> 00:01:45.478
More and more curries.

00:01:45.478 --> 00:01:47.454
And then over here you
have some stir fry dishes.

00:01:47.454 --> 00:01:49.287
More and more curries.

00:01:50.643 --> 00:01:54.329
And more and more curries,
and more and more curries,

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.958
and they just keep on going.

00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:58.282
They just keep on going.

00:01:58.282 --> 00:02:01.374
And then over here
finally, you have some toms

00:02:01.374 --> 00:02:05.541
which are different boiled
soups to finish it off.

00:02:28.053 --> 00:02:28.886
America.

00:02:47.575 --> 00:02:50.158
(upbeat music)

00:03:00.798 --> 00:03:03.423
If you are ever stumped for what to order,

00:03:03.423 --> 00:03:07.253
or for like, you wanna have a
variety of different dishes,

00:03:07.253 --> 00:03:09.178
this is the restaurant to come to.

00:03:09.178 --> 00:03:11.026
Okay I'm gonna go eat now.

00:03:11.026 --> 00:03:13.019
I tried to choose some
of the unique dishes

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:14.457
that they had here

00:03:14.457 --> 00:03:17.423
and the food looks incredibly good.

00:03:17.423 --> 00:03:20.107
Just unbelievable, unreal
how many choices of dishes

00:03:20.107 --> 00:03:21.005
you can eat here.

00:03:21.005 --> 00:03:22.594
First dish that I want to try,

00:03:22.594 --> 00:03:25.100
and actually this is Ying's favorite dish.

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:26.794
She called it "hoy chu chu"

00:03:26.794 --> 00:03:30.636
and that means snails that
you, or shells that you kiss,

00:03:30.636 --> 00:03:33.216
because you have to like
suck them out of the shell.

00:03:33.216 --> 00:03:35.367
But I think they might actually be hoy kom

00:03:35.367 --> 00:03:38.382
which is a type of fresh snail.

00:03:38.382 --> 00:03:40.100
They are in a coconut milk curry,

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.043
there are Kaffir limes leaves in here.

00:03:42.043 --> 00:03:44.376
And let's test that kissing.

00:03:45.746 --> 00:03:47.633
I'll put this onto my rice

00:03:47.633 --> 00:03:51.397
and then you can pick one of these out,

00:03:51.397 --> 00:03:52.873
they're little, little tiny guys

00:03:52.873 --> 00:03:55.017
and you can see the little snail in there.

00:03:55.017 --> 00:03:56.277
And so yeah, you really gotta

00:03:56.277 --> 00:03:59.694
suck and kiss them to get that snail out.

00:04:02.008 --> 00:04:03.599
Okay this guy is not coming
out with the kiss method

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:04.671
so I'm gonna have to,

00:04:04.671 --> 00:04:05.810
oh thanks for the toothpick.

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.477
By the way, I just kissed out
some of that curry, which is,

00:04:08.477 --> 00:04:12.644
it is spicy and you can taste
a lot of coconut milk in there

00:04:13.688 --> 00:04:16.857
you can taste some lemongrass,
and those Kaffir lime leaves.

00:04:16.857 --> 00:04:18.972
There you go, come on guy.

00:04:18.972 --> 00:04:20.201
Oh there we go.

00:04:20.201 --> 00:04:23.661
These are little just
tiny, tiny little bites.

00:04:23.661 --> 00:04:24.494
Alright.

00:04:26.263 --> 00:04:27.260
Yeah.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:28.910
It's like squid, almost like squid.

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:30.375
I can also taste black pepper in there,

00:04:30.375 --> 00:04:33.028
I can taste all those
spices in the curry paste,

00:04:33.028 --> 00:04:34.931
and then it's a little
bit citrus-y as well.

00:04:34.931 --> 00:04:37.419
Moving on to the next station.

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:40.162
This one is, she called
it "gaeng taypo hua pla"

00:04:40.162 --> 00:04:43.442
and that's, gaeng taypo is
a type of, a type of curry,

00:04:43.442 --> 00:04:47.209
and then this is with hua
pla which is the fish head,

00:04:47.209 --> 00:04:49.974
but then this is, gaeng
taypo is usually made with

00:04:49.974 --> 00:04:52.486
preserved salted fish which
I think this is what it is.

00:04:52.486 --> 00:04:56.069
So I'll take a piece
of this onto the rice.

00:04:57.875 --> 00:05:01.803
Get more of that, I love
the color of this curry,

00:05:01.803 --> 00:05:05.696
it's really really like bright orange.

00:05:05.696 --> 00:05:06.529
Oh yeah.

00:05:08.523 --> 00:05:11.232
And then what I can do is,

00:05:11.232 --> 00:05:13.268
you gotta really navigate,
because this is fish head,

00:05:13.268 --> 00:05:14.363
you gotta navigate.

00:05:14.363 --> 00:05:16.805
Look at the color of that fish.

00:05:16.805 --> 00:05:18.357
Wow that looks like, that looks like,

00:05:18.357 --> 00:05:20.024
like preserved meat.

00:05:26.515 --> 00:05:27.932
Oh that's superb.

00:05:29.057 --> 00:05:30.443
The first taste that I taste

00:05:30.443 --> 00:05:32.270
is actually like a sourness,

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:33.665
a wonderful sourness.

00:05:33.665 --> 00:05:37.643
The fish is salty, but
it literally, that fish,

00:05:37.643 --> 00:05:40.406
literally, not only is it
the color of corned beef,

00:05:40.406 --> 00:05:42.891
but it almost tastes
like fish corned beef.

00:05:42.891 --> 00:05:44.141
That's amazing.

00:05:45.214 --> 00:05:49.524
So you got the, the like
salty fish preserve,

00:05:49.524 --> 00:05:52.005
but it doesn't have a strong fishy taste,

00:05:52.005 --> 00:05:53.785
you might not even know that it's fish.

00:05:53.785 --> 00:05:55.896
It could almost pass for meat.

00:05:55.896 --> 00:05:57.582
Incredibly, incredibly good.

00:05:57.582 --> 00:05:59.999
That's really awesomely good.

00:06:01.757 --> 00:06:03.332
That is stunning.

00:06:03.332 --> 00:06:05.834
Next up, this one is a salad.

00:06:05.834 --> 00:06:08.063
She called it a "yam" or mix,

00:06:08.063 --> 00:06:12.755
and it is with little crabs,
with little rice patty crabs

00:06:12.755 --> 00:06:15.085
and then she said this, the main

00:06:15.085 --> 00:06:17.904
bulk of the dressing is made from makam,

00:06:17.904 --> 00:06:20.202
which is sour tamarind,

00:06:20.202 --> 00:06:22.668
and then there's chiles in
here, there's shallots in here.

00:06:22.668 --> 00:06:25.108
And this is these little patty crabs,

00:06:25.108 --> 00:06:27.257
so there's not really a lot of meat,

00:06:27.257 --> 00:06:28.800
but the joy of eating these,

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.293
it's just kind of chewing on the shells

00:06:31.293 --> 00:06:32.883
and sucking out the flavor again.

00:06:32.883 --> 00:06:34.770
I'll just pick out this guy.

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:38.937
Let me add on some more of
that sauce, that tamarind,

00:06:40.058 --> 00:06:42.725
and then just kind of chew this.

00:06:49.743 --> 00:06:51.666
Oh that dressing.

00:06:51.666 --> 00:06:54.228
That dressing is sweet and sour

00:06:54.228 --> 00:06:56.879
and really really garlicky.

00:06:56.879 --> 00:06:58.602
And a little bit spicy.

00:06:58.602 --> 00:07:01.428
But you can also really
taste the tamarind.

00:07:01.428 --> 00:07:03.345
And it's sour tamarind,

00:07:04.213 --> 00:07:05.556
and they kind of just mash that up

00:07:05.556 --> 00:07:09.472
so you can even taste like
the bits of the tamarind,

00:07:09.472 --> 00:07:12.654
the like seed and pod within
there, that's very sour.

00:07:12.654 --> 00:07:13.942
And then I got just a little bit of crab,

00:07:13.942 --> 00:07:17.249
well there's only a little
bit of crab, but it's raw.

00:07:17.249 --> 00:07:20.972
So it's kind of slimy to
contrast that dressing.

00:07:20.972 --> 00:07:23.472
Whoa, that is a lot of flavor.

00:07:25.235 --> 00:07:26.761
Let me break off one of these legs.

00:07:26.761 --> 00:07:28.048
And what you can kind of do,

00:07:28.048 --> 00:07:30.821
you kind of gotta bite it
with the front of your teeth

00:07:30.821 --> 00:07:32.980
and then, kind of tough to navigate,

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:34.958
and you've got a little bit of,

00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:37.330
of meat on the inside there yeah, oh yeah.

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:39.966
You can see there's the crab right there.

00:07:39.966 --> 00:07:41.736
And then you can kind of just almost like,

00:07:41.736 --> 00:07:45.486
squeeze it out like a
tiny tub of toothpaste.

00:07:46.446 --> 00:07:47.279
Oh yeah.

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:50.870
It's nice and slimy.

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:52.460
That dressing is amazing though.

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:54.627
Next up is this gaeng kua gai baan.

00:07:54.627 --> 00:07:57.737
And this is, it's like
a free range chicken

00:07:57.737 --> 00:07:59.746
in a really, look at that sauce,

00:07:59.746 --> 00:08:01.669
look at that curry sauce.

00:08:01.669 --> 00:08:04.499
That color and that thickness.

00:08:04.499 --> 00:08:05.666
Onto the rice.

00:08:08.459 --> 00:08:10.239
I believe that's a boneless piece.

00:08:10.239 --> 00:08:14.406
But there are a lot of
non-boneless pieces as well.

00:08:20.652 --> 00:08:23.668
This is a curry that never
fails in southern Thailand.

00:08:23.668 --> 00:08:28.133
It's just a flavor overload
of spice and herbs.

00:08:28.133 --> 00:08:28.966
Delicious.

00:08:28.966 --> 00:08:31.482
And finally we got a yam mamuang salad.

00:08:31.482 --> 00:08:33.130
This is a green mango salad.

00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:34.127
There's little fish in here,

00:08:34.127 --> 00:08:35.862
there are shallots in here and chiles.

00:08:35.862 --> 00:08:38.279
Think I got that little fish.

00:08:46.321 --> 00:08:49.656
That mango is really really sour

00:08:49.656 --> 00:08:52.729
and it has a texture that's
not unlike a cucumber,

00:08:52.729 --> 00:08:55.026
like a juicy crispness.

00:08:55.026 --> 00:08:57.414
The dressing, yeah it is quite spicy,

00:08:57.414 --> 00:08:58.911
there's a lot of chiles in there.

00:08:58.911 --> 00:09:00.928
And then it's contrasted,

00:09:00.928 --> 00:09:03.066
the whole flavor is contrasted
by the fish which are,

00:09:03.066 --> 00:09:05.148
have a little bit of a
fishy dry taste to them.

00:09:05.148 --> 00:09:08.430
That goes great with this
whole spread of spicy curries.

00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:10.119
It's about 11:30 A.M. right now

00:09:10.119 --> 00:09:12.913
and the restaurant is pretty full.

00:09:12.913 --> 00:09:15.817
But this is a huge, not huge,

00:09:15.817 --> 00:09:17.147
but it's a pretty big restaurant.

00:09:17.147 --> 00:09:20.837
It's just kind of like an
open downstairs of a building,

00:09:20.837 --> 00:09:22.687
and literally the entire front

00:09:22.687 --> 00:09:25.413
is occupied by all the different curries.

00:09:25.413 --> 00:09:26.963
And then they just sort of have a,

00:09:26.963 --> 00:09:29.639
almost like cafeteria style dining hall.

00:09:29.639 --> 00:09:31.642
Here let me pick up the
camera so you can see this.

00:09:31.642 --> 00:09:33.993
So they just have like big
long family style tables

00:09:33.993 --> 00:09:36.286
where you can just grab your food.

00:09:36.286 --> 00:09:38.399
You can either order, another
tip I want to give you

00:09:38.399 --> 00:09:39.399
is that you can either order,

00:09:39.399 --> 00:09:41.326
this is called gaap khao,

00:09:41.326 --> 00:09:43.139
which means you get a plate of rice

00:09:43.139 --> 00:09:45.910
and then you order different
dishes like this on the side,

00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:46.989
separate.

00:09:46.989 --> 00:09:48.773
Or you can order raad khao,

00:09:48.773 --> 00:09:49.935
which is where you get one plate of rice

00:09:49.935 --> 00:09:52.717
and then they scoop on
right onto the plate of rice

00:09:52.717 --> 00:09:54.307
your different dishes.

00:09:54.307 --> 00:09:57.395
So if you want to eat
big, go for gaap khao.

00:09:57.395 --> 00:10:01.083
If you want to eat small and
light, for for raad khao.

00:10:01.083 --> 00:10:05.098
But either way, that's, it's
gonna be delicious food.

00:10:05.098 --> 00:10:08.117
Let me try again with the snail sucking.

00:10:08.117 --> 00:10:10.784
Grab one of these guys, alright.

00:10:13.575 --> 00:10:16.360
That came out immediately that time.

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:18.487
But it has a little extra shell on the end

00:10:18.487 --> 00:10:20.209
that you don't want to eat.

00:10:20.209 --> 00:10:21.434
That was fantastic.

00:10:21.434 --> 00:10:24.767
So I just gotta tough one my first time.

00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:29.886
Oh it came again.

00:10:29.886 --> 00:10:31.522
These are so addictively good.

00:10:31.522 --> 00:10:33.591
Here's the aftermath of that meal.

00:10:33.591 --> 00:10:34.959
That is a successful meal.

00:10:34.959 --> 00:10:37.115
My plate is full of empty shells

00:10:37.115 --> 00:10:41.012
and some giant fish bones, fish jaw bones.

00:10:41.012 --> 00:10:44.555
Wow that was, that was
awesome, awesome food.

00:10:44.555 --> 00:10:46.735
One of the things I love so
much about Nakhon Si Thammarat

00:10:46.735 --> 00:10:50.400
is that I think I've eaten
around southern Thailand

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:52.956
and I think Nakhon Si Thammarat,
just on a general basis,

00:10:52.956 --> 00:10:56.559
the food is the spiciest of
all the southern Thai provinces

00:10:56.559 --> 00:10:57.761
that I've been to.

00:10:57.761 --> 00:10:59.662
So good, my mouth is on fire right now

00:10:59.662 --> 00:11:01.556
and I just, I love it.

00:11:01.556 --> 00:11:04.068
If you come to Nakhon
Si Thammarat, the city,

00:11:04.068 --> 00:11:06.854
this is a restaurant you have to eat at.

00:11:06.854 --> 00:11:08.117
The actual real name of this restaurant

00:11:08.117 --> 00:11:09.932
is Krua Ba Jong

00:11:09.932 --> 00:11:12.017
but people locally know
it and refer to it as

00:11:12.017 --> 00:11:14.184
Khao Gae Suchon Sapan Yao,

00:11:15.346 --> 00:11:19.230
and that means, like, awesome
awesome rice and curry,

00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:21.006
which is next to that bridge,

00:11:21.006 --> 00:11:22.973
and the bridge is just down that road.

00:11:22.973 --> 00:11:25.730
So this place is an
attraction in and of its own

00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:27.599
within Nakhon Si Thammarat.

00:11:27.599 --> 00:11:29.983
I'm so happy after that
lunch, that I can barely even,

00:11:29.983 --> 00:11:31.790
I just want to relax.

00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:34.056
But a good way to relax

00:11:34.056 --> 00:11:35.681
is gonna be to head to the national park

00:11:35.681 --> 00:11:37.262
and we're going to a
waterfall which is called

00:11:37.262 --> 00:11:38.994
Karom Waterfall,

00:11:38.994 --> 00:11:41.511
and it is, I just searched it on the map,

00:11:41.511 --> 00:11:42.984
it's about 30 kilometers away.

00:11:42.984 --> 00:11:44.896
We'll take about 30 minutes to get there.

00:11:44.896 --> 00:11:45.942
So we're on our way

00:11:45.942 --> 00:11:47.820
to do some relaxing in nature now.

00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:50.403
(upbeat music)

00:12:02.535 --> 00:12:04.341
We made it to Nam Dtok Karom,

00:12:04.341 --> 00:12:07.820
which is Karom Waterfall,
or Karom Waterfall.

00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:10.741
Immediately as I opened
the door of the car,

00:12:10.741 --> 00:12:13.337
you can just hear the sound of the jungle,

00:12:13.337 --> 00:12:14.857
or the highlight of this waterfall

00:12:14.857 --> 00:12:16.392
are the different layers of the waterfall.

00:12:16.392 --> 00:12:19.188
There's supposed to be, I'm
not sure how many layers,

00:12:19.188 --> 00:12:22.021
but a lot of layers of waterfalls.

00:12:25.059 --> 00:12:27.309
And it's so green and lush.

00:12:33.176 --> 00:12:34.598
And there is multiple layers,

00:12:34.598 --> 00:12:36.858
it just keeps like
cascading down the mountain.

00:12:36.858 --> 00:12:38.582
But I think this is
the, is this the fourth?

00:12:38.582 --> 00:12:39.945
Is this the fourth layer?

00:12:39.945 --> 00:12:41.363
- [Woman] Yeah.

00:12:41.363 --> 00:12:43.493
- This is the fourth layer,

00:12:43.493 --> 00:12:45.098
but they say you can go
to the fifth and sixth

00:12:45.098 --> 00:12:46.883
and seventh layer,

00:12:46.883 --> 00:12:49.117
but it's a little bit of
a hike and kind of steep.

00:12:49.117 --> 00:12:51.969
So I'm just gonna quickly
go up to the other layers,

00:12:51.969 --> 00:12:54.852
and I can't wait to see
the other layers as well

00:12:54.852 --> 00:12:56.516
and then come back here to take a swim.

00:12:56.516 --> 00:12:58.654
I've been doing a lot of
eating in Nakhon Si Thammarat

00:12:58.654 --> 00:13:00.248
so it feels great to get some exercise

00:13:00.248 --> 00:13:03.051
and breathe in this fresh jungle air.

00:13:03.051 --> 00:13:05.634
(upbeat music)

00:13:12.662 --> 00:13:15.123
Okay I just made it to the seventh level,

00:13:15.123 --> 00:13:17.272
and wow, it is the biggest,

00:13:17.272 --> 00:13:20.361
yeah it's pretty big, it's beautiful.

00:13:20.361 --> 00:13:22.944
(upbeat music)

00:13:23.989 --> 00:13:26.712
The main waterfall is right to this side.

00:13:26.712 --> 00:13:29.529
And it also goes down like a
series of shelves on the rock,

00:13:29.529 --> 00:13:31.179
but it's just solid rock,

00:13:31.179 --> 00:13:33.213
and you can see that this spring,

00:13:33.213 --> 00:13:37.604
and then on this side you have
a huge nice pool of water.

00:13:37.604 --> 00:13:40.125
That would be really nice for swimming,

00:13:40.125 --> 00:13:42.097
but I'm gonna wait to swim
until I get back down,

00:13:42.097 --> 00:13:43.977
because I want to swim with my family.

00:13:43.977 --> 00:13:46.560
(upbeat music)

00:13:56.981 --> 00:13:59.070
From where this camera is sitting,

00:13:59.070 --> 00:14:01.481
it's hard to see the
whole perspective of this,

00:14:01.481 --> 00:14:03.521
but this is a really nice pool

00:14:03.521 --> 00:14:08.236
at the bottom of a, just,
layers of rock waterfall.

00:14:08.236 --> 00:14:09.999
And it's this beautiful area,

00:14:09.999 --> 00:14:11.977
this is a great place to swim.

00:14:11.977 --> 00:14:14.560
(upbeat music)

00:14:19.435 --> 00:14:21.495
All of the falls and all the levels

00:14:21.495 --> 00:14:23.236
are really really nice to visit

00:14:23.236 --> 00:14:25.574
and taking a swim is so refreshing

00:14:25.574 --> 00:14:28.492
and so necessary in this climate.

00:14:28.492 --> 00:14:29.941
It feels so good.

00:14:29.941 --> 00:14:31.393
This is a wonderful thing to do

00:14:31.393 --> 00:14:32.886
when you come to Nakhon Si Thammarat,

00:14:32.886 --> 00:14:34.450
I'm glad we decided to make it out here.

00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:36.478
And it's not too far away from the city,

00:14:36.478 --> 00:14:38.800
makes a great little day
trip or half day trip,

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:41.851
especially after you eat
some delicious curry.

00:14:41.851 --> 00:14:43.298
