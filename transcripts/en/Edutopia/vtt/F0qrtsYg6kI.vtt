00:00:05.116 --> 00:00:07.166
&gt;&gt;Amy: Kenny is a student
that participated

00:00:07.166 --> 00:00:08.666
in my grit program last year.

00:00:09.226 --> 00:00:10.606
&gt;&gt;Kenny: This is my evaporator.

00:00:10.896 --> 00:00:15.976
&gt;&gt;Amy: He's a perfect example
of a ten year old with grit.

00:00:25.046 --> 00:00:27.656
In New Hampshire, we do a lot
of sugaring, which is the term

00:00:27.656 --> 00:00:29.976
for making maple sugar and
it's a whole ton of work.

00:00:31.056 --> 00:00:34.936
&gt;&gt;Kenny: This one's actually
kind of-- got some in it, rrrr.

00:00:36.046 --> 00:00:40.686
&gt;&gt;Amy: And he does it all on his
own and he'll collect the sap

00:00:40.686 --> 00:00:43.976
with the steers, boil the sap and
then get the end result of the syrup.

00:00:46.436 --> 00:00:47.000
&gt;&gt;Kenny: Easy.

00:00:48.046 --> 00:00:50.926
&gt;&gt;Amy: He will be able to accomplish
anything that he sets his mind to.

00:00:55.406 --> 00:00:59.336
&gt;&gt;I'm Amy Lyon and my goal is to
spread the good word about grit.

00:01:09.706 --> 00:01:14.166
&gt;&gt;Angela: Grit is a disposition
to pursue very long term goals

00:01:14.536 --> 00:01:15.806
with passion and perseverance.

00:01:16.036 --> 00:01:19.106
It shouldn't look the same
in a four year old as it does

00:01:19.106 --> 00:01:21.596
in a forty year old, because
developmentally, at the beginning

00:01:21.596 --> 00:01:24.476
of life, your job is to figure
out what you're gonna do,

00:01:24.826 --> 00:01:27.186
the little place that you're
gonna hold in the world

00:01:27.186 --> 00:01:29.676
and how you're going to
add value and survive.

00:01:29.676 --> 00:01:32.236
And I think children are
exploring lots of things.

00:01:32.496 --> 00:01:33.826
&gt;&gt;My goal is to pitch more strikes.

00:01:34.096 --> 00:01:35.596
&gt;&gt;To become a better short stop.

00:01:35.916 --> 00:01:37.016
&gt;&gt;To lift a slap shot.

00:01:37.466 --> 00:01:39.656
&gt;&gt;To get a ninety in math.

00:01:39.656 --> 00:01:40.396
&gt;&gt;To hit the bull's eye.

00:01:40.556 --> 00:01:42.276
&gt;&gt;To find diamonds in Minecraft.

00:01:42.616 --> 00:01:44.626
&gt;&gt;My goal's to draw better dinosaurs.

00:01:44.796 --> 00:01:46.756
&gt;&gt;My goal's working on division.

00:01:50.426 --> 00:01:53.216
&gt;&gt;Amy: I was introduced to
grit through an article called

00:01:53.216 --> 00:01:54.836
"The Secret to Success is Failure."

00:01:54.886 --> 00:01:56.956
Angela Duckworth was mentioned.

00:01:56.956 --> 00:02:00.106
She had been studying this topic of
Grit and it made a whole lotta sense

00:02:00.106 --> 00:02:05.296
for me, because Angela had defined
it and was able to measure it,

00:02:05.446 --> 00:02:07.896
but nobody had really talked
about teaching it yet.

00:02:07.896 --> 00:02:11.326
&gt;&gt;I want three examples of goals that
you could think about for yourself

00:02:11.446 --> 00:02:13.176
that are years out from now.

00:02:13.976 --> 00:02:17.116
&gt;&gt;Student: Making it on the
A team for my first year

00:02:17.116 --> 00:02:17.976
in middle school, for
the baseball team.

00:02:19.116 --> 00:02:19.496
&gt;&gt;Amy: Okay.

00:02:20.066 --> 00:02:21.866
&gt;&gt;Student: Getting into
a really good college.

00:02:22.216 --> 00:02:25.326
&gt;&gt;Amy: Yeah, you guys can
be thinking about that now.

00:02:25.506 --> 00:02:30.056
Did you know that the United
States has the most kids accepted

00:02:30.056 --> 00:02:33.836
in the college, but we also
have the highest dropout rate.

00:02:34.216 --> 00:02:35.586
What does that tell you?

00:02:36.146 --> 00:02:39.106
&gt;&gt;Student: That we give up easily?

00:02:39.286 --> 00:02:41.326
&gt;&gt;Amy: We give up too
easily, don't we?

00:02:41.876 --> 00:02:46.746
&gt;&gt;I think a lot of schools tend
to incorporate the idea of Grit,

00:02:46.796 --> 00:02:50.066
but I don't know that there's
actually direct instruction

00:02:50.236 --> 00:02:52.676
to lead kids to become grittier.

00:02:53.446 --> 00:02:56.886
So that's why I tried to do,
was to create a curriculum

00:02:57.396 --> 00:02:59.906
that would get right
to the heart of grit

00:03:00.276 --> 00:03:03.296
and have kids practice becoming
grittier throughout the year.

00:03:04.246 --> 00:03:07.366
&gt;&gt;Student: Steady persistence in
a course of action, a purpose,

00:03:07.366 --> 00:03:11.656
especially in spite of difficulties,
obstacles or discouragement.

00:03:11.936 --> 00:03:14.366
&gt;&gt;Student: When you're discouraged
or there's a bunch of things

00:03:14.366 --> 00:03:19.876
that are going on, it's hard to
focus and say to yourself, "Well,

00:03:19.876 --> 00:03:22.676
I know it's a hard time right
now, but I'll get through it."

00:03:22.676 --> 00:03:26.856
And not a lotta people can do
that, and it's a really good thing

00:03:26.856 --> 00:03:29.586
to know how to do, because
there's so many things people give

00:03:29.586 --> 00:03:31.076
up on that are just so easy.

00:03:31.356 --> 00:03:33.046
&gt;&gt;Amy: If you're setting
a far off goal,

00:03:33.046 --> 00:03:36.156
if you're setting a goal that's
years and years and years out,

00:03:36.526 --> 00:03:38.436
it may not be an easy track.

00:03:38.736 --> 00:03:41.976
Things will get in the way, for
sure and you have to figure out how

00:03:41.976 --> 00:03:43.606
to manage them, deal with them,

00:03:43.966 --> 00:03:46.046
move on and keep working
towards your goal.

00:03:46.396 --> 00:03:48.146
And that's what resiliency is about.

00:03:48.206 --> 00:03:50.816
&gt;&gt;Angela: It's never too early to
start thinking about, you know,

00:03:50.956 --> 00:03:53.756
how do we teach kids how to set
goals, how to stick with goals,

00:03:53.796 --> 00:03:56.546
how to stay persistent
in the face of temptation

00:03:56.546 --> 00:03:58.026
and distraction and adversity?

00:03:58.176 --> 00:04:01.566
And the idea is that if you can
put those skills in place early on,

00:04:01.566 --> 00:04:04.576
that's just as important as teaching
a child how to, you know, read,

00:04:04.576 --> 00:04:05.876
how to write, how to count.

00:04:06.546 --> 00:04:08.406
We read lots and lots of articles.

00:04:08.576 --> 00:04:12.026
We think about research designs,
but teachers have a different kind

00:04:12.026 --> 00:04:13.756
of knowledge and it's
been really profitable,

00:04:13.756 --> 00:04:17.346
in particular with our partnership
with, for example, the KIPP schools,

00:04:17.376 --> 00:04:19.066
where we've been doing
research for five years.

00:04:19.376 --> 00:04:22.936
Many of our research ideas were
truly a marriage of insights

00:04:22.986 --> 00:04:27.806
from KIPP staff, married with our
scientific expertise together.

00:04:44.506 --> 00:04:47.266
&gt;&gt;Beth: People who have
self-control have a lot more power

00:04:47.266 --> 00:04:50.986
to change their future, to reach
the goals that they want to reach.

00:04:51.666 --> 00:04:54.506
&gt;&gt;When we decided to integrate
grit into our curriculum,

00:04:54.506 --> 00:04:56.716
one of the first concerns
was, "Where am I gonna fit it

00:04:56.716 --> 00:04:59.136
in my otherwise very busy day?"

00:04:59.706 --> 00:05:02.286
But what it turns out is,
you're doing it already.

00:05:02.656 --> 00:05:05.526
Every time you teach children
the process of writing

00:05:05.526 --> 00:05:09.346
and generating ideas and sticking
with writing over a long period

00:05:09.346 --> 00:05:12.256
of time and revising, that's
teaching them the skills

00:05:12.256 --> 00:05:13.306
that they need to have grit.

00:05:13.306 --> 00:05:16.676
It's probably all around you and
the trick is to just highlight it

00:05:16.816 --> 00:05:18.756
and make your students
more conscious of it.

00:05:18.756 --> 00:05:21.116
That will help them
develop grit themselves.

00:05:22.216 --> 00:05:25.246
&gt;&gt;Angela: It's been said,
the point of life is to love,

00:05:25.396 --> 00:05:26.886
to be loved and to be useful.

00:05:26.886 --> 00:05:30.406
I think grit is very important, at
least for that third thing, right?

00:05:30.406 --> 00:05:33.356
To be useful, to be useful
to our fellow human beings,

00:05:33.356 --> 00:05:35.066
and kids have a natural instinct.

00:05:35.096 --> 00:05:37.446
When you give a six
year old a task to do,

00:05:37.446 --> 00:05:38.766
"Can you please clear the table?"

00:05:38.996 --> 00:05:41.586
and they successfully do that and
you praise them for doing that,

00:05:41.586 --> 00:05:42.466
it makes them feel terrific.

00:05:42.466 --> 00:05:44.496
And I think it makes them
actually feel more terrific

00:05:44.496 --> 00:05:45.416
than an ice cream cone.

00:05:45.416 --> 00:05:48.236
And as we get older and
older, I think the importance

00:05:48.236 --> 00:05:51.636
of being useful becomes
more and more salient to us.

00:05:51.636 --> 00:05:56.376
So I think for kids, you know,
the idea of being gritty enough

00:05:56.636 --> 00:06:01.036
to learn something, to master it,
so that you can be good at it,

00:06:01.236 --> 00:06:04.526
that you can be useful, is very
important, no matter what it is

00:06:04.526 --> 00:06:05.626
that in fact you choose to do.
