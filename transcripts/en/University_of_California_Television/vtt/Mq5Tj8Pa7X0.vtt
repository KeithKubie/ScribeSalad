00:00:01.802 --> 00:00:02.635
(robotic dinging)

00:00:02.635 --> 00:00:03.820
- [Announcer] This program is presented by

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:06.250
University of California Television.

to keep up with the latest UCTV programs.

00:00:20.505 --> 00:00:23.672
(light, upbeat music)

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.410
- Good afternoon and welcome.

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.140
My name is Mary Comerio.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.260
I am Professor of the Graduate School

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.220
in the College of Environmental Design

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.270
and Chair of the Hitchcock
Professorship Committee.

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.750
We are pleased, along
with the Graduate Council,

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.980
to present Paul Goldberger,
this year's speaker,

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.280
in the Charles M. and Martha
Hitchcock Lecture Series.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.930
As a condition of this bequest,

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.950
we are obligated and
very happy to tell you

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.483
how the endowment came to UC Berkeley.

00:01:14.596 --> 00:01:17.140
And it's a story that
exemplifies the many ways

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:18.530
in which the campus is linked

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.820
to the history of California
and to the Bay Area.

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.960
Dr. Charles Hitchcock, a
physician for the Army,

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.910
came to San Francisco during the Gold Rush

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.280
where he opened a thriving practice.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.920
In 1885, Charles
established a professorship

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.320
here at Berkeley, as an expression

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.170
of his long-held interest in education.

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.840
His daughter, Lillie Hitchcock Coit,

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.670
still treasured in San Francisco

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.900
for her colorful personality as well as

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.060
her generosity, greatly
expanded her father's

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.930
original gift to establish a professorship

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.970
at UC Berkeley, making it possible for us

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.560
to present this series of lectures.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.430
The Hitchcock Fund has become
one of the most cherished

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.190
endowments of the
University of California,

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.190
recognizing the highest distinction

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.450
of scholarly thought and achievement.

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.560
Thank You Lillie and Charles,

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.313
and now a few words about Paul Goldberger.

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.390
Paul Goldberger holds
the Joseph Urban Chair

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.690
in Design and Architecture
at The New School

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.440
located in New York City.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.130
He is a Contributing Editor to Vanity Fair

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.500
and has been called the leading figure

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.650
in architectural criticism
by the Huffington Post.

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.460
Until 2011, he wrote the
popular Sky Line column

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:35.470
for The New Yorker and served

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.260
as the magazine's architectural critic.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.520
He began his career in journalism

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.090
at the New York Times where
he won the Pulitzer Prize

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.800
for Distinguished Criticism in 1984.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.020
Goldberger's first
lecture will be an inquiry

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.290
as to whether cities are
becoming more and more the same,

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.830
and why, and what the
implications for this are.

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.210
The second lecture will discuss

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:00.180
the question of whether
or even if the premise

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.150
of the first lecture is true.

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.620
Cities, nevertheless, remain catalysts

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.080
for creativity and why.

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.850
A prolific writer, Goldberger
just completed a biography

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.210
of Frank Gehry to be
published by Alfred Knopf

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:17.400
this coming September,
titled Building Art,

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.590
The Life and Work of Frank Gehry.

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.240
He has many other books,
most recent meaning

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.930
is Why Architecture Matters,

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.890
but I am not gonna read
you this entire list.

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.130
We wanna hear him not me.

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.640
He has, however, chronicled the process

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.950
of rebuilding Ground Zero, Up From Zero,

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:37.970
Politics, Architecture and the Rebuilding

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.860
of New York, which was
published in New York in 2004

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.880
and was named a New
York Times Notable Book.

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.070
He was educated at Yale University

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:50.250
and has received honorary
doctorates from Pratt Institute,

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.550
the University of Miami, Kenyon College

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:55.400
and the College of Creative Studies

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.800
and the New York School
of Interior Design.

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.000
He is a former Dean of
Parsons School of Design,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.920
a Division of The New School,
and has taught at Yale

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.550
and the Graduate School of
Journalism at UC Berkeley.

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:10.580
He is a frequent lecturer
on architecture design,

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.770
historic preservation and cities,

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:15.530
often appearing in film and television.

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.560
He served as an architectural adviser

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.680
to major cultural and
educational institutions.

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.650
He has received many awards.

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.560
I will only name two.

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.920
The medal of the American
Institute of Architects

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.930
and the Medal of Honor of the New York

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.360
Landmarks Preservation Foundation.

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.602
Please join me in welcoming
Paul Goldberger to Berkeley.

00:04:34.602 --> 00:04:37.602
(audience applauds)

00:04:44.437 --> 00:04:47.510
- Thank you very much Mary.

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:49.810
This is the most wonderful
old Berkeley room,

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:51.460
I have to say, actually.

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.090
it's a great pleasure
and an even greater honor

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.090
to be here, and to join

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:59.330
this extraordinary series
of Hitchcock professors

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.963
who've come to Berkeley
over the last hundred years.

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:06.940
For all that we're invited
to give of our knowledge,

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.220
I suspect that most Hitchcock professors

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:12.033
have received far more than they've given.

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:18.890
And I know that that
will be my case as well,

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:22.010
so I'm especially
appreciative of the invitation

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:25.130
to be on this extraordinary campus again.

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:28.150
Now I'm gonna talk this week,
as you've heard, about cities,

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:30.750
what they mean right now in our culture

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:33.070
and what we can make of them now

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:35.593
in the early decades of the 21st century,

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:40.433
about what cities are now and
about what they ought to be.

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:43.270
I should tell you now,
right at the outset,

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:46.850
that I've decided to make this talk

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:49.590
something of a revolt against the thing

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:53.030
that seems now all too often to define

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:55.493
the modern lecture, which is PowerPoint.

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:58.960
I'm gonna do something that is rare

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:02.510
in the realm of lectures,
particularly in the realm

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:05.040
of lectures that have some connection

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:08.000
to architecture and architectural history,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.723
which is to talk without images.

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:12.430
It's a little bit, I know,

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:17.410
like walking a tightrope without
a net, but I will try it.

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:20.040
I'm doing it because I
think a lot of the things

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:23.570
I wanna talk about are
familiar to most of you.

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:26.970
I'll talk a lot about San
Francisco and the Bay Area

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:29.560
both today and tomorrow,

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:34.560
and also because I'd like to
talk a fair amount about ideas

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:38.120
and I think that's more important

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.880
than showing you a parade of images.

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.060
I think you have enough
images in your head already

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:44.730
to understand where I'll be going

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:46.073
over the next few minutes.

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:48.230
And the other reason I've decided

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:50.490
to steer clear of PowerPoint

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:52.940
is because I am not interested in using it

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:54.487
to throw data at you.

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:58.450
We're deluged with data today.

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:00.450
And while much of it is useful

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:05.050
and some of it even has the
added benefit of being true,

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:08.170
I don't think the points I
want to make are best explained

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:10.053
by a cascade of numbers.

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:14.363
Now today's talk is
entitled The Generic City,

00:07:15.912 --> 00:07:20.500
Can the 21st Century Ever
Build Special Places?

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:24.580
A question that I hope is
not entirely rhetorical.

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:26.883
Tomorrow I'll talk
about The Creative City,

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:31.910
Why Cities Remain the
Catalysts of Creativity,

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:33.750
and I recognize that there might seem

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:37.060
to be a bit of a contradiction
between these two topics.

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:40.770
Obviously the two talks
were conceived as a pair,

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:41.780
but it would be a mistake

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:44.980
to think of the first as pessimistic,

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:47.010
intended to suggest that the city today

00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:51.180
is nothing but a generic banal place,

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:54.230
the victim of the global monoculture,

00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:57.120
and that the talk I'll give
tomorrow is optimistic,

00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:00.250
intended to make the point that
everything is fine after all

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:03.313
because good things still
happen in these dreary places.

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:06.973
It's not nearly so simple as that.

00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:10.260
And I'm not sure in the end

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.460
that it wouldn't be more accurate to say

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:15.320
that today and tomorrow I'll
be looking at the same subject

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:17.560
through slightly different lenses

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:19.410
and showing how it is possible

00:08:19.410 --> 00:08:21.800
to look at the contemporary city

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:23.530
and come to very different conclusions

00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:25.960
about what it is, how it functions

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:28.440
and what it means for our culture.

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:30.960
But that's getting ahead of the story.

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:32.470
Let me start by going back

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:37.367
40 or 50 years to the cities
of the 1960s and 1970s,

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:39.920
when in the in the United States

00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:42.480
and in much of the rest of the world

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:46.210
if you did a free association
test with the word urban,

00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:48.490
the answer you would probably
come up with most often

00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:53.490
would be crisis, or problem, or challenge.

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:56.550
The urban crisis was a given.

00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:59.860
Cities were harsh, dirty and dangerous.

00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:01.080
And in this country at least,

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:03.500
if you could afford to live somewhere else

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:05.740
you quite often did.

00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:08.763
The Asian cities that now loom so large,

00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:13.130
were large, but they did not loom.

00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:16.330
They had very little to
do with the global economy

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:18.840
and they were technologically backward.

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:20.900
The major cities on the world stage

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:24.890
were European and American
for the most part,

00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:27.713
and a great many of them were a mess.

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:31.780
I began my own professional
life in New York

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:34.430
in the 1970s and when I talk about it

00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:37.720
I realize that the city
I remember from my 20s

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:39.850
is as disconnected from the reality

00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:42.380
of what students know today,

00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:44.330
as the world of The Depression

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:47.320
that my parents and
grandparents talked about

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:50.813
was disconnected from
the reality that I knew.

00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:54.500
I don't know that New York in the 1970s

00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:57.800
was as truly horrific
as it was made out to be

00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:59.600
in the various movies of the age,

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:02.743
like Taxi Driver and The
Taking of Pelham 123,

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:05.800
but it wasn't pretty.

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:07.970
It was dirty and ill-kempt.

00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:10.200
The subway, though it wasn't really

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:12.120
too dangerous to ride in,

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:13.780
was dirty and full of graffiti

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:17.750
and various unsavory
types, especially at night

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:21.420
and it had a weird tendency
to stop between stations

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:25.230
mysteriously as if the
equipment had broken down

00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:27.400
and there was either no announcement

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:30.130
of what the problem was or a message

00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:32.850
over a malfunctioning PA system

00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:34.837
that sounded sort of
like (speaks gibberish).

00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:40.700
Now in those days I worked
at the New York Times,

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:44.250
which was located logically
enough at Times Square,

00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:46.780
which was not the prettified
somewhat Disneyfied

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:50.890
tourist environment it is now.

00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:54.320
It was more of an amalgam
of sleazy movie theaters,

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:56.850
many pornographic striptease joints,

00:10:56.850 --> 00:11:01.570
massage parlors, pickpockets,
muggers, you name it,

00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:05.960
all wrapped in a dazzling
array of lights and signs.

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:08.730
I remember from time to time
seeing the occasional tourist

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:12.040
wandering around dazed and confused

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:14.490
and wishing I could say to them,

00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:16.740
can't I take you to the
Metropolitan Museum,

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:19.060
the Museum of Modern Art, somewhere else

00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:22.133
so you don't think this is
all there is to New York.

00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:25.760
You really did feel that the public realm

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:28.940
was in disarray, that no one was in charge

00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:32.360
or that the people who
were nominally in charge

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:35.210
had no power to fix what was broken,

00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:37.490
that even the best of the public officials

00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:39.850
seemed rather hapless,

00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:43.260
bewildered by the challenges they faced.

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:46.080
We seemed unable to keep
Central Park clean and safe

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:47.980
let alone the subway system.

00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:50.640
And while there were
occasional extravaganzas

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:53.700
that distracted everyone
from the immediate

00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:58.270
problems at hand, such as the
famous Be-Ins in Central Park

00:11:58.270 --> 00:12:01.110
that attracted thousands, often to protest

00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:05.260
the Vietnam War, remember
this was the 1960s.

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:08.760
These events, inspiring though they were,

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:10.940
only caused Frederick Law Olmsted's

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:13.010
astonishingly great work of landscape

00:12:13.010 --> 00:12:15.280
to deteriorate further because nobody

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:17.210
was putting any money into maintenance

00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:20.493
and the park, like everything
else, was falling apart.

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:25.860
Large corporations wanted none of this

00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:27.960
and dozens of them
moved their headquarters

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:28.923
out of the city.

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:32.590
Most often, as the great urbanologist,

00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:35.890
William H. Whyte discovered,
to a suburban location

00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:38.550
in Connecticut or Westchester
County or New Jersey

00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:41.700
that just happened to
be within a few miles

00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:43.693
of where the chief executive lived.

00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:47.800
Now there I admit is a piece of data

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:49.800
that was quite useful to have turned up.

00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:54.050
The city seemed to be losing
not only its middle class

00:12:54.050 --> 00:12:55.960
which had always struggled somewhat

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:58.830
under urban pressures but its upper class,

00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:00.750
the people who in past generations

00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:05.403
had sailed blithely over
everything and everyone else.

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:09.090
It was terrifyingly
easy to buy real estate

00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:11.140
because nobody wanted it.

00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:13.230
You could buy great
apartments on Fifth Avenue

00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:17.880
facing Central Park for
$100,000 for even less.

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:19.360
A sum that today, in New York,

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:22.360
won't buy you a one room studio apartment

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:24.540
in a marginal neighborhood.

00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:25.980
If things were happening anywhere

00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:28.070
it was in places like Houston,

00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:29.500
where there was still plenty of money

00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:32.400
and a fundamentally
suburban corporate culture

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:34.990
that had only minimal interest

00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:38.710
in what we might call or
would come to call later

00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:42.423
a culture of urbanism,
a culture of cities.

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:46.010
Let me talk for a moment
about that culture

00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:50.170
which was hardly limited to Houston.

00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:52.310
It was really the American culture

00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:55.150
and it was a culture whose
fundamental characteristic

00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:57.430
at least so far as urbanism was concerned

00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:01.130
was that it valued the private realm

00:14:01.130 --> 00:14:03.710
over the public realm.

00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:07.520
The public realm, such
as it was, was disdained,

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:09.583
distrusted or ignored.

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:13.384
I'm not sure it was ever
even really understood

00:14:13.384 --> 00:14:16.150
because when the public
realm was really functioning

00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:18.643
in the great days of American urbanism,

00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:22.300
the decades before World War II,

00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:23.840
it was just a natural thing

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:27.320
that people took for granted,
like the air you breathed

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:29.350
and the water you drank.

00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:33.400
You didn't think you were
experiencing the public realm

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:36.390
when you walked down Main
Street and went shopping,

00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:38.790
or when you took a stroll in the park.

00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:41.410
These were just the
natural things that you did

00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:43.680
and I don't think there was much

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:46.510
consciousness of how important it was

00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:49.840
because it seemed like such
a natural part of life,

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:53.840
not just in a big city but
in a small town or village,

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:55.500
where the parks and village squares

00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:57.900
and sidewalks lined with stores

00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:01.030
were as much a part of life as the schools

00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:03.023
and the churches and the houses.

00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:09.110
But by the 1950s we'd begun
to stop investing in this.

00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:12.680
We weren't conscious of how
much the public realm meant.

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:14.660
How it was really the most important thing

00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:16.653
the city could possibly symbolize,

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:21.650
had always symbolized, which is the idea

00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:23.430
of common ground.

00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:25.840
The notion that the city expresses

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:29.673
in physical form, the commonweal,

00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:32.980
and that the public
realm stands for the way

00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:37.460
in which our diverse complex society

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:39.210
can come together.

00:15:39.210 --> 00:15:41.560
Not by papering over our differences

00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:44.920
but by acknowledging
them, and by so doing,

00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:46.743
helping us to transcend them.

00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:51.300
These are always our aspirations

00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:53.700
and it is in the nature of the city

00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:58.080
to facilitate them by
privileging public space

00:15:58.080 --> 00:15:59.993
over private space.

00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:04.790
But come the 1960s and 1970s,

00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:07.420
as with Central Park, so was it through

00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:09.930
much of the United States.

00:16:09.930 --> 00:16:13.670
We couldn't even take care
of the public realm we had

00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:16.390
let alone build any more of it.

00:16:16.390 --> 00:16:19.190
We didn't seem to want
to build more of it,

00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:21.910
that's my real point, that society seemed

00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:24.710
to have given up on
caring about the notion

00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:28.860
of public space, the
idea of the commonweal

00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:32.853
as being represented by
our common public realm.

00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:36.970
The suburbs and the automobile culture,

00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:39.420
of course do the exact opposite of this.

00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:43.383
They privilege private
space over public space.

00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:47.600
And while I do not mean to
lay all of our urban issues

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:49.433
at the foot of the automobile,

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:53.570
there is no question that it
has been a nearly constant

00:16:53.570 --> 00:16:54.823
enemy of cities.

00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:58.340
But there is something
about the urban idea

00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:00.280
and something about the automobile

00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:03.503
that are in some fundamental
way incompatible.

00:17:04.350 --> 00:17:07.200
When you make a city work
well for the automobile

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:11.313
it almost invariably works
less well for the pedestrian.

00:17:12.190 --> 00:17:16.010
The car is itself a form of public space,

00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:18.810
private space rather, excuse me.

00:17:18.810 --> 00:17:21.180
The car is itself a form of private space.

00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:22.890
And when you are in it
you are disconnected

00:17:22.890 --> 00:17:27.690
from everything except
that which you choose

00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:29.800
to connect yourself to.

00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:33.370
Be it music, conversation, your smartphone

00:17:33.370 --> 00:17:36.830
or, as is increasingly the
situation with children

00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:39.500
sitting in the backseat, television,

00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:42.240
all of which somehow
seemed to have the effect

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:44.460
not only of disconnecting people in a car

00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:46.180
from the world around them

00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:47.813
but also from each other.

00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:52.060
Now I am really not here to
rant about the automobile,

00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:53.883
as I said, or about technology.

00:17:54.770 --> 00:17:57.490
But it is hard not to think that so far as

00:17:57.490 --> 00:18:00.500
the meaning of urban space is concerned

00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:04.090
technology does not always connect us

00:18:04.090 --> 00:18:05.910
as we like to think.

00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:08.643
In some ways it separates us.

00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:13.360
Cars are private pods zipping
around in public space

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:15.413
rendering it effectively private.

00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:18.770
But then again people on telephones

00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:20.530
and listening to their iPods

00:18:20.530 --> 00:18:23.680
are in private space as well,

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:26.330
disconnected from the
people and the environment

00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:27.530
that is all around them.

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:32.150
The automobile and of course the airplane

00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:35.760
changed our sense of place,
and by making us mobile,

00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:37.740
and less wedded to a single place

00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:41.430
than our ancestors were,
but the technology of today

00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:43.170
goes that one better,

00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:45.811
and allows us wherever
we may physically be

00:18:45.811 --> 00:18:49.300
to function as if we were somewhere else.

00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:50.930
In effect, technology allows you

00:18:50.930 --> 00:18:53.390
to have a virtual presence anywhere

00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:56.050
which is wonderful until you realize

00:18:56.050 --> 00:18:59.150
that this has the result, in some ways,

00:18:59.150 --> 00:19:01.940
of making you feel like you are less

00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:03.203
where you really are.

00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:08.933
And it makes all places
seem more or less the same.

00:19:10.210 --> 00:19:13.260
You know, once your very telephone number

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:15.060
was a kind of badge of place,

00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:16.870
a sign of where you were.

00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:18.900
You couldn't be reached unless you

00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:21.120
actually were in that place,

00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:24.800
on that piece of earth
connected to that telephone,

00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:28.633
that instrument that we now
quaintly call a landline.

00:19:29.490 --> 00:19:32.090
It's increasingly common, I realize,

00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:35.600
for cell phone conversations to begin

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:37.683
with the question, where are you?

00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:43.140
And for the answer of
course to be anything

00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:46.933
from out by the pool to Madagascar.

00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:51.280
Now I don't miss the
age when phone charges

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:54.180
were based on distance, but that did have

00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:57.390
the beneficial effect
of at least reinforcing

00:19:57.390 --> 00:19:59.600
a sense that places were distinguishable

00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:00.960
from one another.

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:04.700
Now, with your cell phone,
calling across the street

00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:06.850
and calling from New York to California

00:20:06.850 --> 00:20:09.410
are precisely the same thing.

00:20:09.410 --> 00:20:11.060
They cost the same because, to the phone,

00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:12.690
they are the same.

00:20:12.690 --> 00:20:16.693
Every place is just a node on a network.

00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:22.973
And so, increasingly,
are we, that's my point.

00:20:24.250 --> 00:20:25.990
Before we even get into the question

00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:28.520
of whether all places
are physically the same,

00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:32.050
the idea I've called the generic city.

00:20:32.050 --> 00:20:35.300
We can see that all places
are equally accessible

00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:36.790
and that wherever we are,

00:20:36.790 --> 00:20:40.300
we are no longer rooted in that place

00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:42.550
in the way that we once were.

00:20:42.550 --> 00:20:44.870
We may be physically in one place

00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:48.943
but we are now virtually
anywhere and everywhere.

00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:53.860
Before we move on entirely from technology

00:20:55.810 --> 00:20:58.690
I would like to come
back for just one moment

00:20:58.690 --> 00:21:01.920
and make another point that is relevant

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:03.220
to the larger question here

00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:04.410
and connects to the arguments

00:21:04.410 --> 00:21:07.440
that Dr. Richard Jackson at UCLA

00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:10.440
has been making for years,
which is that the places

00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:12.750
in which people drive all the time

00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:15.240
are inherently unhealthy.

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:17.780
If you need to walk you will,

00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:20.200
and as a consequence you are healthier.

00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:24.110
If you don't need to
walk you probably won't

00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:26.420
or at least you will walk a lot less

00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:27.870
and you will be less healthy.

00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:31.570
Health of course correlates to many things

00:21:31.570 --> 00:21:35.980
and not just this one, but Dr. Jackson

00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:37.970
has done a vital service to the world

00:21:37.970 --> 00:21:40.960
of architecture and planning in giving us

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:43.170
another set of reasons for believing

00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:47.400
that the traditional dense
pedestrian-oriented city

00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:49.040
is a good thing.

00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:51.150
Many architects and
planners have believed this

00:21:51.150 --> 00:21:52.830
for a long time.

00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:55.580
And from time to time there
has been other evidence

00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:57.690
about the benefits to the social fabric

00:21:57.690 --> 00:22:02.690
inherent in denser pedestrian-oriented
towns and villages,

00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:04.180
not to mention the benefits

00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:07.890
in terms of energy use and sustainability.

00:22:07.890 --> 00:22:09.280
But Dr. Jackson has shown us

00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:10.700
that the greatest sustainability

00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:12.280
we get from traditional cities

00:22:13.410 --> 00:22:16.290
is that we ourselves are sustained,

00:22:16.290 --> 00:22:17.540
because we are healthier.

00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:21.430
There I concede is another instance

00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:24.380
in which some hard data is useful,

00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:25.980
even though I'm not focusing

00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:28.623
on quantifiable data this afternoon.

00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:33.570
I want instead to talk
about the nature of place

00:22:33.570 --> 00:22:35.773
and about what gives a place its identity.

00:22:36.990 --> 00:22:40.243
Here in the Bay Area that
question is an easy one.

00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:45.740
It is the bay itself, the
natural landscape of the hills,

00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:47.680
the landmarks of San Francisco,

00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:50.540
the Golden Gate Bridge, the Bay Bridge,

00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:53.033
the tower on this campus,
the Maybach buildings

00:22:53.033 --> 00:22:56.040
and the other classic
buildings of Berkeley

00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:58.010
just for a start.

00:22:58.010 --> 00:22:59.920
We could go on and on.

00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:02.750
No one has ever confused the Bay Area

00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:06.900
with any place else, and so, in a way,

00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:09.370
this is an odd place
in which to be talking

00:23:09.370 --> 00:23:12.610
about this problem because it barely seems

00:23:12.610 --> 00:23:13.943
to be a problem here.

00:23:15.130 --> 00:23:17.350
But let's go down the peninsula a bit

00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:20.270
to Silicon Valley, to San
Jose, to Mountain View

00:23:20.270 --> 00:23:22.473
and Menlo Park and Palo Alto.

00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:27.220
Stanford aside, sorry I've mentioned

00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:28.810
that unmentionable thing.

00:23:28.810 --> 00:23:31.030
I should have thought this through

00:23:31.030 --> 00:23:33.250
a little more carefully, I apologize.

00:23:33.250 --> 00:23:38.110
Anyway an unmentionable
private university aside,

00:23:38.110 --> 00:23:40.620
it is a landscape that looks

00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:44.370
pretty much like other landscapes,
until recently at least,

00:23:44.370 --> 00:23:47.610
when a new whole new
wave of building began.

00:23:47.610 --> 00:23:50.560
There wasn't much to tell
you that this was the place

00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:53.240
in which the world was being remade.

00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:56.170
In which the technology
of the 21st century

00:23:56.170 --> 00:23:58.210
was being developed and the great fortunes

00:23:58.210 --> 00:23:59.603
of our time made.

00:24:00.510 --> 00:24:04.490
What it was, for most of it,
was a banal suburban landscape.

00:24:04.490 --> 00:24:06.910
A place that looked like other places,

00:24:06.910 --> 00:24:09.750
and I should add, a place that depended

00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:12.563
almost entirely on the automobile.

00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:15.870
Indeed for a long time
the most notable thing

00:24:15.870 --> 00:24:18.190
about the appearance of Silicon Valley

00:24:18.190 --> 00:24:19.970
was how ordinary it was.

00:24:19.970 --> 00:24:22.033
How much it looked like every place else,

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:24.630
or at least like every other collection

00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:28.570
of reasonably prosperous American suburbs.

00:24:28.570 --> 00:24:33.460
Yes it had that campus and
some handsome mountain scenery

00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:35.580
marking its western edge.

00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:39.550
But the rest of the place
has always been made up

00:24:39.550 --> 00:24:41.690
of places that could
have been almost anywhere

00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:44.010
like the 101 Freeway and the strip malls

00:24:44.010 --> 00:24:46.120
and the supermarkets
and the car dealerships

00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:49.690
and motels and low-rise office parks.

00:24:49.690 --> 00:24:52.620
Even after a few people
began doing unusual things

00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:54.700
in their garages, and other people

00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:58.000
started inventing things
in university laboratories

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.770
and even after some of these
turned into the beginnings

00:25:00.770 --> 00:25:05.060
of large corporations,
even then Silicon Valley

00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:08.690
didn't look very different
from everyplace else.

00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:12.250
It was a landscape of
freeways and strip malls.

00:25:12.250 --> 00:25:13.083
There was certainly

00:25:13.083 --> 00:25:16.280
nothing about it that told
you that this was a place

00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:19.230
that had generated more
wealth than anywhere else

00:25:19.230 --> 00:25:20.660
in our time.

00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:23.690
Or, more to the point,
the place that seemed

00:25:23.690 --> 00:25:27.380
to demonstrate more creative imagination

00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:29.523
than any other place in our time.

00:25:31.170 --> 00:25:35.270
You could go so far as to
say that at least for a while

00:25:35.270 --> 00:25:38.520
a determined indifference
to the physical world

00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:40.520
seemed an inherent part of the identity

00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:41.980
of Silicon Valley.

00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:44.410
In the same way that you
don't expect computer geeks

00:25:44.410 --> 00:25:47.860
to pay much attention to their wardrobes,

00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:50.460
it didn't seem odd that the Valley towns

00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:53.860
had a dull anywhere USA veneer

00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:57.070
or that the biggest and
most successful companies

00:25:57.070 --> 00:25:59.500
seemed to operate out
of low-rise buildings

00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:02.330
that looked as if they'd been built

00:26:02.330 --> 00:26:04.110
off the Long Island Expressway

00:26:04.110 --> 00:26:06.460
to house insurance agencies.

00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:07.840
It wasn't just because most of them

00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:09.210
started out on a shoestring

00:26:10.050 --> 00:26:11.570
and took what space they could

00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:14.950
progressing from a garage
to random office space

00:26:14.950 --> 00:26:16.830
wherever they could find it.

00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:20.340
It was also because, Steve Jobs aside,

00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:23.350
most people in Silicon
Valley didn't care much

00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:25.373
about what things looked like.

00:26:26.490 --> 00:26:29.860
Buildings were kind of whatever,

00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:32.040
just like clothing, which is why

00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:34.460
the first Silicon Valley structures

00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:39.311
were to architecture as the
hoodie is to haberdashery.

00:26:39.311 --> 00:26:41.440
(audience laughs)

00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:43.430
All of this is now changing rapidly

00:26:43.430 --> 00:26:45.040
in a number of ways.

00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:46.240
There's a surge of interest

00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:47.950
in ambitious pieces of architecture

00:26:47.950 --> 00:26:50.530
now in Silicon Valley, driven partly

00:26:50.530 --> 00:26:53.710
by Steve Jobs's desire
shortly before his death

00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:56.610
to create a home for Apple

00:26:56.610 --> 00:26:58.870
that would be as refined a work of design

00:26:58.870 --> 00:27:00.070
as Apple's products are.

00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:03.640
The new Apple headquarters
by Norman Foster

00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:06.560
looks rather too much
like an Apple product,

00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:07.620
in my view.

00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:10.570
I think it's an object more
than a work of architecture,

00:27:10.570 --> 00:27:14.450
an iPod blown up to gargantuan scale.

00:27:14.450 --> 00:27:17.360
But that's another
discussion for another day.

00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:20.520
Suffice it to say that
Apple raised the bar.

00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:22.930
And Facebook followed
commissioning Frank Gehry

00:27:22.930 --> 00:27:25.910
to design a new complex
that has just been finished

00:27:25.910 --> 00:27:29.690
and now Google is beginning
work on a new headquarters

00:27:29.690 --> 00:27:32.170
designed by the Bjarke Ingels Group,

00:27:32.170 --> 00:27:36.020
the Copenhagen architect
now resettled in New York

00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:38.970
and Thomas Heatherwick,
the London designer.

00:27:38.970 --> 00:27:41.330
These companies are now so large

00:27:41.330 --> 00:27:43.700
and there is so much
money connected to them

00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:46.620
and more importantly so much determination

00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:48.680
to play a conspicuous role in the culture

00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:52.930
that architecture inevitably
had to enter the picture.

00:27:52.930 --> 00:27:57.930
The people whose job it is to
make the virtual world for us

00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:02.870
had to acknowledge that they
wanted a better presence

00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:04.083
in the physical world.

00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:06.750
How successful all of this will be

00:28:06.750 --> 00:28:09.020
remains to be seen, but it is surely

00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:14.020
making Silicon Valley far less the generic

00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:17.500
almost banal environment that it has been

00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:18.573
for so long.

00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:21.260
The other way in which this is changing

00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:24.250
is arguably more important,
but I'll talk more about that

00:28:24.250 --> 00:28:27.370
tomorrow since it
involves a profound change

00:28:27.370 --> 00:28:29.467
in the relationship between the Valley

00:28:29.467 --> 00:28:31.810
and the city of San Francisco,

00:28:31.810 --> 00:28:33.860
and says a lot about the role of the city

00:28:33.860 --> 00:28:35.610
as a creative engine.

00:28:35.610 --> 00:28:37.790
So I'll come back to Silicon Valley

00:28:37.790 --> 00:28:40.290
and to San Francisco tomorrow

00:28:40.290 --> 00:28:41.970
and look at their relationship

00:28:41.970 --> 00:28:44.160
from a very different standpoint,

00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:46.350
I think a more positive one.

00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:48.340
But for now let's go to
some other large cities,

00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:51.030
to ones that are not San Francisco,

00:28:51.030 --> 00:28:52.980
and talk for a moment about how they work

00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:54.433
at this moment in time.

00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:57.630
I think it's almost a truism to state

00:28:57.630 --> 00:29:00.740
that cities are more alike
than they used to be.

00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:05.110
The experience of arrival
into similar looking airports,

00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:06.690
the trip to the center of the city

00:29:06.690 --> 00:29:09.070
often takes you along similar freeways

00:29:09.070 --> 00:29:11.080
past similar landscapes.

00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:13.260
And upon arrival in the center city

00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:15.750
you see similar skyscrapers.

00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:17.440
You unpack your bags in a hotel

00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:19.060
that could be anywhere and it doesn't even

00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:22.240
have to be a tired Hilton or Marriott.

00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:25.490
It might even be a trendy W or Andaz,

00:29:25.490 --> 00:29:27.860
and it is still the same or feels the same

00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:29.820
from city to city.

00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:31.590
You take a walk and grab a snack

00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:33.970
at the Shake Shack or you shop at J.Crew

00:29:33.970 --> 00:29:36.730
or Ralph Lauren or Williams-Sonoma

00:29:36.730 --> 00:29:40.093
or whatever, the same
places you find at home.

00:29:41.710 --> 00:29:44.040
But it is not just the places

00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:45.693
that are increasingly the same.

00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:49.053
It is also all of us.

00:29:50.010 --> 00:29:54.160
We are more the same
because we are less shaped

00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:56.470
by the culture of our individual places

00:29:56.470 --> 00:29:58.810
in which we live and more shaped

00:29:58.810 --> 00:30:02.150
by the culture of the world
which we are exposed to

00:30:02.150 --> 00:30:05.490
at every moment thanks to technology.

00:30:05.490 --> 00:30:08.740
We must not underestimate
the extent to which

00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:13.700
if places feel the same, it
is because the people in them

00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:16.473
are more the same than they once were.

00:30:17.410 --> 00:30:19.300
It can be anywhere, as I said,

00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:22.710
before it amounts in a
sense to being nowhere.

00:30:22.710 --> 00:30:26.480
Nowhere, that is, except
in the virtual any place,

00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:29.423
every place that is the
world of technology,

00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:31.923
accessible to all of us.

00:30:33.950 --> 00:30:38.930
Now every place is, to a
greater or lesser extent,

00:30:38.930 --> 00:30:41.110
a product of its time.

00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:43.210
Cities built in the 18th century,

00:30:43.210 --> 00:30:45.900
at least in this country,
had certain similarities

00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:48.080
as did cities built in the 19th

00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:50.000
and cities built in the 20th.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.560
I say that not to deny
regional or cultural

00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:56.390
or geographical
differences, but to suggest

00:30:56.390 --> 00:30:59.680
that time has always played some role

00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:01.930
in shaping urban identity.

00:31:01.930 --> 00:31:04.300
I'll say more about that in a minute.

00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:06.560
But I think that the factor of time

00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:08.880
will become ever more important

00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:12.260
as cultural and geographical influences

00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:14.330
become less important.

00:31:14.330 --> 00:31:15.600
They will become less important

00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:18.943
because every place is
exposed to the same ones.

00:31:19.950 --> 00:31:23.530
The forces that made Paris
different from London,

00:31:23.530 --> 00:31:25.690
that made Rome grow into a place

00:31:25.690 --> 00:31:28.080
different from Milan or Jerusalem

00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:30.023
or Istanbul or Tokyo.

00:31:30.870 --> 00:31:33.593
Those forces no longer exist.

00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:36.320
Those seven places are now

00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:40.610
exposed to and shaped by similar forces

00:31:40.610 --> 00:31:43.713
as global culture continues to homogenize.

00:31:45.030 --> 00:31:48.440
This has been understood,
if not always welcomed,

00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:52.190
as a byproduct of
modernism for a long time.

00:31:52.190 --> 00:31:55.010
Marshall McLuhan spoke
of the Global Village,

00:31:55.010 --> 00:31:57.660
although he said later
that he did not envision

00:31:57.660 --> 00:31:59.890
the connections wrought by technology

00:31:59.890 --> 00:32:03.223
as reducing differences as
they appear to have done.

00:32:04.210 --> 00:32:09.050
In 1932 Henry Russell
Hitchcock and Philip Johnson

00:32:09.050 --> 00:32:11.880
coined the term the International Style

00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:14.960
to represent the austere minimalist

00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:17.930
modern architecture
that they saw correctly

00:32:17.930 --> 00:32:21.000
was moving rapidly across the globe.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:24.510
They were of course celebrating its spread

00:32:24.510 --> 00:32:26.793
not thinking about its consequences.

00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:32.360
Okay, we all know that globalization,

00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:35.530
which often means the
increasing westernization

00:32:35.530 --> 00:32:39.370
of all places, has a staggering impact

00:32:39.370 --> 00:32:41.130
and that in the face of this

00:32:41.130 --> 00:32:44.250
it has become becoming harder and harder

00:32:44.250 --> 00:32:47.570
for places to maintain a clear physical,

00:32:47.570 --> 00:32:49.993
not to say cultural identity.

00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:52.743
What can we do about this?

00:32:53.740 --> 00:32:56.260
Let me bring our focus
back to architecture

00:32:56.260 --> 00:32:58.330
by quoting from a recent blog posting

00:32:58.330 --> 00:33:01.540
by the architecture
critic Witold Rybczynski,

00:33:01.540 --> 00:33:04.610
who tried to tie this to
the never-ending debate

00:33:04.610 --> 00:33:07.100
in the world of architecture about,

00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:12.100
and I apologize for using this
ersatz word, starchitects.

00:33:12.505 --> 00:33:15.380
The celebrated architects
who travel around the globe

00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:17.020
dropping new buildings into cities

00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:19.270
and then moving on to the next.

00:33:19.270 --> 00:33:20.740
You know who I mean.

00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:24.200
Norman Foster, Renzo Piano, Zaha Hadid,

00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:28.250
Frank Gehry, Rem Koolhaas, Jean Nouvel,

00:33:28.250 --> 00:33:30.100
are at the top of the list right now.

00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:33.890
Rybczynski said that such hype and,

00:33:33.890 --> 00:33:36.910
quote, high-powered architects diminished

00:33:36.910 --> 00:33:39.940
rather than helped cities largely because

00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:43.150
they don't understand the
places in which they build.

00:33:43.150 --> 00:33:45.510
And he suggested that
globe-trotting architects

00:33:45.510 --> 00:33:49.240
merely delivered the
shapes that interested them

00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:52.140
with little concern for context.

00:33:52.140 --> 00:33:55.030
In the long rise, in the long run,

00:33:55.030 --> 00:33:58.850
it's wiser to nurture
local talent, he said,

00:33:58.850 --> 00:34:00.433
instead of starchitects, locatects.

00:34:03.870 --> 00:34:05.690
But is this so?

00:34:05.690 --> 00:34:07.470
And if skylines around the world

00:34:07.470 --> 00:34:09.430
are looking too much the same

00:34:09.430 --> 00:34:11.560
is this because the new
and important buildings

00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:14.100
are done by the big names from far away

00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:15.323
and not by the locals?

00:34:16.390 --> 00:34:17.760
I'm actually more inclined to think

00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:19.110
that the opposite is true.

00:34:19.110 --> 00:34:21.120
That the distinguishing new buildings

00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:22.710
in many cities are the very ones

00:34:22.710 --> 00:34:24.830
that were done by outsiders.

00:34:24.830 --> 00:34:27.840
Cesar Pelli's Petronas Towers in Malaysia,

00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:31.860
Kohn Pedersen Fox's Shanghai
World Center in Shanghai

00:34:31.860 --> 00:34:34.950
and Mori Tower in Tokyo.

00:34:34.950 --> 00:34:38.470
Jean Nouvel's Torre Agbar in Barcelona.

00:34:38.470 --> 00:34:41.880
Frank Gehry's Eight Spruce
Street Tower in New York

00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:45.200
and Renzo Piano's Shard in London.

00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:48.130
No, they're not all great,
but they're distinctive

00:34:48.130 --> 00:34:51.370
and they help give their cities skylines

00:34:51.370 --> 00:34:55.235
that push back against
the forces of sameness,

00:34:55.235 --> 00:34:57.803
the tendencies toward the generic.

00:34:58.810 --> 00:35:02.430
In Tokyo, KAJIMA DESIGN,
an enormous design

00:35:02.430 --> 00:35:06.290
and construction firm that
is as local as you can get

00:35:06.290 --> 00:35:10.210
designed NTT Docomo Yoyogi Building,

00:35:10.210 --> 00:35:12.710
the eighth tallest building in Japan,

00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:15.860
and a conspicuous element on the skyline

00:35:15.860 --> 00:35:19.163
to look like a knockoff of
the Empire State Building.

00:35:20.180 --> 00:35:22.580
So much for the natives
having an innate feel

00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:25.700
for the DNA of a particular place.

00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:27.700
I'll take the work of the carpetbagger

00:35:27.700 --> 00:35:29.913
over that kind of local any day.

00:35:30.810 --> 00:35:35.810
Even taller than the NTT is
the new Toranomon Hills Tower

00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:41.620
designed by another Japanese
megafirm Nihon Seiki

00:35:41.620 --> 00:35:43.350
and it looks a lot like the angled

00:35:43.350 --> 00:35:45.510
slightly sculpted glass towers

00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:47.570
that you see in almost every city

00:35:47.570 --> 00:35:48.963
in the United States.

00:35:49.910 --> 00:35:53.440
I don't see much that
is inherently Tokyoesque

00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:55.293
in either of these skyscrapers.

00:35:56.350 --> 00:35:58.490
And I've been talking
only about skyscrapers,

00:35:58.490 --> 00:36:01.340
the buildings that define the skyline.

00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:03.790
Museums, civic center's, concert halls,

00:36:03.790 --> 00:36:07.290
bridges, libraries, opera houses

00:36:07.290 --> 00:36:09.720
all give cities part of
their identity as well

00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:12.520
and many of the ones that succeed best

00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:16.360
and make places feel
special were not designed

00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:18.870
by local architects
either, but by architects

00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:21.740
who were hired because it was thought

00:36:21.740 --> 00:36:24.380
that they could bring more imagination

00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:27.840
and a sense of freshness to the problem.

00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:29.733
And often enough they have.

00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:33.520
One of the best new
buildings I saw last summer

00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:36.210
was the expansion of
the Clark Art Institute

00:36:36.210 --> 00:36:37.880
in Williamstown, Massachusetts,

00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:41.410
by the Japanese architect Tadao Ando,

00:36:41.410 --> 00:36:44.163
who was about as un-Berkshires
as you could get.

00:36:45.290 --> 00:36:48.310
Everybody knows how successful

00:36:48.310 --> 00:36:52.280
Frank Gehry's Guggenheim
Museum in Bilbao Spain is,

00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:56.130
but I'm mystified as to
why Witold Rybczynski

00:36:56.130 --> 00:36:59.320
felt compelled to say in
that piece I was quoting

00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:02.540
that Gary's Walt Disney
Concert Hall in Los Angeles

00:37:02.540 --> 00:37:05.220
is superior to it, and I quote,

00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:08.270
because Gary knows and
understands Los Angeles

00:37:08.270 --> 00:37:10.390
better than Bilbao.

00:37:10.390 --> 00:37:14.010
I admire both buildings,
but if you ask me,

00:37:14.010 --> 00:37:16.000
Bilbao is the one that actually shows

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:20.200
a more inventive, understanding
and subtle connection

00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:23.660
to its urban context
than Gary's concert hall

00:37:23.660 --> 00:37:24.773
in his home city.

00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:29.290
By the same token, is
Norman Foster's round

00:37:29.290 --> 00:37:32.980
Gherkin skyscraper really
a better addition to London

00:37:32.980 --> 00:37:35.130
than his Hearst Tower in New York?

00:37:35.130 --> 00:37:39.200
Because Foster, again I
quote, exhibits a surer touch

00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:40.493
on his home ground?

00:37:41.380 --> 00:37:43.050
Foster actually hasn't lived in London

00:37:43.050 --> 00:37:46.910
in more than a decade, though
his firm is based there.

00:37:46.910 --> 00:37:49.580
For many years he's lived
part time in New York

00:37:49.580 --> 00:37:51.490
and part time in Switzerland,

00:37:51.490 --> 00:37:53.470
and his building in Midtown Manhattan

00:37:53.470 --> 00:37:56.570
possesses a swagger that
makes it, to my mind,

00:37:56.570 --> 00:37:59.870
very much in character with its place.

00:37:59.870 --> 00:38:02.840
But to Rybczynski, the Hearst Tower

00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:05.400
is not New York enough
because it's sculptural shape

00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:08.070
stopped abruptly on the 46th floor

00:38:08.070 --> 00:38:10.273
to give way to a flat top.

00:38:12.250 --> 00:38:15.410
I bow to no one in my love of the crown

00:38:15.410 --> 00:38:17.197
to the Chrysler Building
or the Woolworth Building

00:38:17.197 --> 00:38:19.100
and the Empire State Building,

00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:20.850
but I hardly see how that means

00:38:20.850 --> 00:38:23.850
that the flat-topped Seagram Building

00:38:23.850 --> 00:38:26.390
by Mies van der Rohe of Chicago

00:38:26.390 --> 00:38:29.350
or the CBS Building by Eero Saarinen,

00:38:29.350 --> 00:38:31.960
then of Bloomfield Hills, Michigan,

00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:34.193
were inappropriate to New York.

00:38:35.290 --> 00:38:38.650
Iconic structures confer
a sense of identity

00:38:38.650 --> 00:38:43.023
on a city at least as much as
they reflect that identity.

00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:47.740
That's where the issue of
urban identity gets interesting

00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:50.840
in my mind, if not a little perplexing.

00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:55.570
By that I mean there was
nothing particularly Parisian

00:38:55.570 --> 00:38:58.293
about the Eiffel Tower until it was built.

00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:01.880
And now, of course, for much of the world,

00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:05.203
for all of us in this room
surely, it defines Paris.

00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:07.393
What made it Parisian?

00:39:08.230 --> 00:39:11.080
Certainly not its height, since Paris,

00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:12.770
either then or now, was not known

00:39:12.770 --> 00:39:14.473
as a city of tall structures.

00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:19.590
Yes, Gustave Eiffel was a great engineer

00:39:19.590 --> 00:39:22.830
and there was a tradition of
advanced engineering in France

00:39:22.830 --> 00:39:25.600
but France was not unique in this regard.

00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:28.600
The fact that the tower
combines engineering brilliance

00:39:30.844 --> 00:39:33.330
with a lyrical beauty and that this

00:39:33.330 --> 00:39:37.730
is particularly Parisian, maybe.

00:39:37.730 --> 00:39:39.070
But you could say the same thing

00:39:39.070 --> 00:39:41.860
about Eero Saarinen and the St. Louis Arch

00:39:41.860 --> 00:39:45.860
or the CN Television Tower in Toronto,

00:39:45.860 --> 00:39:49.840
each of which has made its
form symbolic of its city,

00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:52.970
and by doing so has rescued the skylines

00:39:52.970 --> 00:39:54.963
of those cities from ordinariness.

00:39:55.940 --> 00:39:58.790
If the lyricism of the Eiffel Tower

00:39:58.790 --> 00:40:01.270
made it right for Paris,

00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:03.430
what is there about the graceful curves

00:40:03.430 --> 00:40:06.430
of the St. Louis Arch
that speaks to something

00:40:06.430 --> 00:40:08.123
in the nature of St. Louis?

00:40:09.550 --> 00:40:12.930
Nothing, that's my point.

00:40:12.930 --> 00:40:16.360
We conferred the St.
Louisness, so to speak,

00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:18.930
on it later, which is how this process

00:40:18.930 --> 00:40:21.710
almost always works.

00:40:21.710 --> 00:40:24.620
Surely the quirky Transamerica Pyramid

00:40:24.620 --> 00:40:27.140
by William Pereira, now is identifiable,

00:40:27.140 --> 00:40:29.860
a part of the San Francisco skyline

00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:32.700
as the towers of the bridges

00:40:32.700 --> 00:40:36.000
was not inherently San Franciscan.

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:39.030
But it come to be identified with the city

00:40:39.030 --> 00:40:41.740
perhaps only because the very quirkiness

00:40:41.740 --> 00:40:44.310
that made critics dislike it at first

00:40:44.310 --> 00:40:46.810
has made it memorable over the years.

00:40:46.810 --> 00:40:49.050
And as the association with the city

00:40:49.050 --> 00:40:50.543
has grown and developed.

00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:54.580
Now of course, so many huge skyscrapers

00:40:54.580 --> 00:40:57.160
have been built, the Transamerica

00:40:57.160 --> 00:40:59.470
which once seemed to punctuate the skyline

00:40:59.470 --> 00:41:02.170
is now barely visible within it.

00:41:02.170 --> 00:41:04.490
But again the point is that there was

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:08.880
not much about this building

00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:12.500
that automatically made it
right for San Francisco.

00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:15.240
Over time it has become so.

00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:17.360
By the same token I
would even venture to say

00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:20.550
that the only thing that made
the Empire State Building

00:41:20.550 --> 00:41:23.880
feel like it belonged
in the New York of 1931

00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:24.833
was its height.

00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:29.030
The Empire State's magnificent profile,

00:41:29.030 --> 00:41:31.710
the thing that really
says New York to us now

00:41:31.710 --> 00:41:33.570
and is as much a symbol of the city

00:41:33.570 --> 00:41:35.710
as the Statue of Liberty,

00:41:35.710 --> 00:41:37.670
was the creation of its architects,

00:41:37.670 --> 00:41:39.730
Shreve, Lamb and Harmon.

00:41:39.730 --> 00:41:41.893
And it had no precise precedent.

00:41:42.770 --> 00:41:46.810
It was an invented symbol
and it has served us

00:41:46.810 --> 00:41:48.423
and its city just fine.

00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:53.530
So the problem isn't
the famous architects.

00:41:53.530 --> 00:41:56.150
It's the banal and unimaginative buildings

00:41:56.150 --> 00:41:58.280
designed by other architects,

00:41:58.280 --> 00:42:01.130
and the fact that the
skylines of most cities

00:42:01.130 --> 00:42:04.210
are made up of too many
mediocre buildings that are

00:42:04.210 --> 00:42:05.960
much too big.

00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:07.850
Of course we don't like them.

00:42:07.850 --> 00:42:09.210
I would venture to say that a lot

00:42:09.210 --> 00:42:11.040
of the complaints about cities

00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:13.490
looking all the same these days,

00:42:13.490 --> 00:42:17.610
complaints that, as
I've said, I agree with

00:42:17.610 --> 00:42:20.700
to a large extent, nevertheless
are really complaints

00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:22.523
about too much building, period.

00:42:23.420 --> 00:42:25.390
If those buildings were better

00:42:25.390 --> 00:42:28.040
and not all so big, I guarantee

00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:30.230
that people wouldn't hate them so much,

00:42:30.230 --> 00:42:32.610
no matter how many of them there were.

00:42:32.610 --> 00:42:34.820
The real problem for most people

00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:36.560
isn't that the buildings are the same

00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:39.380
from city to city, it is that there are

00:42:39.380 --> 00:42:42.283
too many buildings and
that they are too big.

00:42:43.890 --> 00:42:46.210
Case in point, let's go back a little more

00:42:46.210 --> 00:42:50.190
than a hundred years to the
heyday of the Beaux-Arts

00:42:50.190 --> 00:42:51.660
in the United States.

00:42:51.660 --> 00:42:54.570
When architects were
contorting classical temples

00:42:54.570 --> 00:42:57.220
into art museums, courthouses, libraries,

00:42:57.220 --> 00:43:01.540
city halls and even, yes, skyscrapers.

00:43:01.540 --> 00:43:04.300
They were doing it in cities
all across the country

00:43:04.300 --> 00:43:06.290
and they weren't making
the actual buildings

00:43:06.290 --> 00:43:08.513
all that different from city to city.

00:43:09.550 --> 00:43:12.050
Cleveland's skyline for years was defined

00:43:12.050 --> 00:43:14.240
mainly by the terminal tower.

00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:18.500
A late 1920s masterpiece
with a classical top

00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:20.660
designed by the Chicago architects

00:43:20.660 --> 00:43:23.120
Graham, Anderson, Probst and White,

00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:24.700
who more or less copied the crown

00:43:24.700 --> 00:43:28.130
of the Municipal Building
by McKim, Mead and White.

00:43:28.130 --> 00:43:29.620
Nobody complained that the buildings

00:43:29.620 --> 00:43:31.280
in those two cities were similar

00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:32.860
or too generic.

00:43:32.860 --> 00:43:35.460
They've always been so well liked

00:43:35.460 --> 00:43:37.533
that it hardly seemed to matter.

00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:40.790
I don't think there were ever complaints

00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:43.770
that the Palace Hotel in San Francisco

00:43:43.770 --> 00:43:46.840
looked like it could
have been built in Boston

00:43:46.840 --> 00:43:49.530
or New York, where its architects,

00:43:49.530 --> 00:43:52.713
Trowbridge and Livingston,
did similar hotels.

00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:56.440
This was a time when scale,

00:43:56.440 --> 00:43:58.540
by and large, was reasonable.

00:43:58.540 --> 00:44:00.630
When very large buildings
were the exception

00:44:00.630 --> 00:44:03.550
and not the rule, and when
the natural order of things

00:44:03.550 --> 00:44:08.150
gave us cities that were more
or less comfortable places,

00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:11.020
at least if you were
not in the lowest rungs

00:44:11.020 --> 00:44:13.450
of the economic ladder and stuck

00:44:13.450 --> 00:44:16.723
in a tiny tenement apartment
with a shared bathroom.

00:44:17.780 --> 00:44:20.820
The natural order of things
did not give us housing

00:44:20.820 --> 00:44:23.470
for everyone that met minimum standards,

00:44:23.470 --> 00:44:26.590
and that did not happen
until planners intervened

00:44:26.590 --> 00:44:29.560
with building codes and zoning laws.

00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:31.950
But a hundred years ago it did not take

00:44:31.950 --> 00:44:34.770
either building codes or zoning laws

00:44:36.700 --> 00:44:40.430
or the intervention of
planners and urban designers

00:44:40.430 --> 00:44:42.370
to give us so many of the neighborhoods

00:44:42.370 --> 00:44:44.100
of San Francisco and Berkeley

00:44:44.100 --> 00:44:47.140
that we still cherish and admire,

00:44:47.140 --> 00:44:49.860
or Greenwich Village or Beacon Hill

00:44:49.860 --> 00:44:54.350
or Georgetown, the last
three being places,

00:44:54.350 --> 00:44:56.450
by the way, that seem to have

00:44:56.450 --> 00:44:59.210
just the right amount
of individual identity,

00:44:59.210 --> 00:45:01.850
but which also shared a great deal

00:45:01.850 --> 00:45:03.333
from city to city.

00:45:05.363 --> 00:45:08.010
And it wasn't only attractive
residential neighborhoods

00:45:08.010 --> 00:45:10.490
that were similar from city to city.

00:45:10.490 --> 00:45:12.520
You could say the same
thing about the museums

00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:16.140
and courthouses and state
capitals all over the country.

00:45:16.140 --> 00:45:18.720
They were widely accepted and admired

00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:23.240
despite how similar they were
from one place to the next.

00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:25.630
Yes, there was plenty of dissent

00:45:25.630 --> 00:45:28.210
from the likes of Louis
Sullivan and Frank Lloyd Wright

00:45:28.210 --> 00:45:31.310
who hated the Beaux-Arts,
and thought classicism

00:45:31.310 --> 00:45:32.940
was the scourge of the age,

00:45:32.940 --> 00:45:35.290
But that's another issue.

00:45:35.290 --> 00:45:38.620
Sullivan, for his part,
built office towers

00:45:38.620 --> 00:45:41.253
in St. Louis and Buffalo
that were sublime,

00:45:42.110 --> 00:45:45.850
but not, when you get right down to it,

00:45:45.850 --> 00:45:48.780
all that different from each other.

00:45:48.780 --> 00:45:50.570
He may have been a genius,

00:45:50.570 --> 00:45:53.453
but he was not always
much for genius loci.

00:45:54.450 --> 00:45:57.530
And Wright, well the Guggenheim Museum

00:45:57.530 --> 00:45:59.360
is one of the greatest things ever built

00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:03.260
in New York City, but
you're on pretty thin ice

00:46:03.260 --> 00:46:05.410
if you try to say that
Wright was reflecting

00:46:05.410 --> 00:46:07.680
the spirit of New York
when he designed it.

00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:09.850
He was doing exactly the opposite.

00:46:09.850 --> 00:46:11.940
He was giving New York a new spirit

00:46:11.940 --> 00:46:15.070
that in time would become a key part

00:46:15.070 --> 00:46:16.493
of the city's identity.

00:46:18.330 --> 00:46:19.970
Most of those traditional architects

00:46:19.970 --> 00:46:22.800
were quite happy to jump from city to city

00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:25.450
designing more or less similar buildings.

00:46:25.450 --> 00:46:27.080
Just as Witold Rybczynski

00:46:27.080 --> 00:46:30.170
accuses today's big names of doing.

00:46:30.170 --> 00:46:33.670
Henry Hobson Richardson was
the starchitect par excellence

00:46:33.670 --> 00:46:37.800
of the 1880s, and Richardsonian
Romanesque buildings

00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:41.200
in imitation of his style
went up in every major city

00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:43.350
from Boston to San Francisco,

00:46:43.350 --> 00:46:45.420
not to mention Minneapolis, Dallas,

00:46:45.420 --> 00:46:47.550
Denver and St. Louis.

00:46:47.550 --> 00:46:49.790
But you didn't hear anyone complain

00:46:49.790 --> 00:46:52.760
that those cities looked generic.

00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:55.380
McKim, Mead and White, based in New York

00:46:55.380 --> 00:46:57.450
built magnificently in the late 19th

00:46:57.450 --> 00:46:59.900
and early 20th centuries in Boston,

00:46:59.900 --> 00:47:03.310
Chicago, Kansas City, Providence,

00:47:03.310 --> 00:47:07.700
Minneapolis, Washington and even Rome.

00:47:07.700 --> 00:47:11.780
So you could call them
the first global stars.

00:47:11.780 --> 00:47:13.620
But they weren't the only ones.

00:47:13.620 --> 00:47:15.780
Daniel Burnham, the Chicagoan

00:47:15.780 --> 00:47:17.710
who is celebrated for
the Flatiron Building

00:47:17.710 --> 00:47:21.380
in New York and Union
Station in Washington, D.C.,

00:47:21.380 --> 00:47:25.080
also built Selfridges
Department Store in London,

00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:27.150
a wonderful, wonderful building,

00:47:27.150 --> 00:47:29.820
but one that, if truth be told,

00:47:29.820 --> 00:47:32.233
has nothing particularly British about it.

00:47:33.940 --> 00:47:36.650
But we can't deny, as I said before,

00:47:36.650 --> 00:47:38.460
that globalization has made things

00:47:38.460 --> 00:47:41.473
different in architecture
as it has in everything.

00:47:42.560 --> 00:47:45.860
Daniel Burnham had to
sail across the ocean

00:47:45.860 --> 00:47:48.150
to work on Selfridges, and his trips

00:47:48.150 --> 00:47:50.580
probably spanned weeks.

00:47:50.580 --> 00:47:53.910
He inevitably immersed
himself in life in London

00:47:53.910 --> 00:47:57.140
and experienced it in a way
that is totally different

00:47:57.140 --> 00:47:59.270
from an international architect of today

00:47:59.270 --> 00:48:02.753
who spends his or her
life in constant motion.

00:48:03.610 --> 00:48:05.580
That same Burnham,

00:48:05.580 --> 00:48:08.280
one of our first
architectural powerhouses,

00:48:08.280 --> 00:48:11.480
came to San Francisco in 1904,

00:48:11.480 --> 00:48:13.700
invited by the city's business leaders

00:48:13.700 --> 00:48:14.943
to design a plan.

00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:19.400
He and his wife stayed for two weeks

00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:22.510
and as his biographer
Thomas Hinds tells us,

00:48:22.510 --> 00:48:25.610
he, and I quote, explored in great detail

00:48:25.610 --> 00:48:29.220
talking, dining and socializing
with personal friends

00:48:29.220 --> 00:48:33.030
and with civic and Association officials.

00:48:33.030 --> 00:48:36.030
He swam and fished in the ocean at Carmel

00:48:36.030 --> 00:48:39.120
and he particularly enjoyed
the exciting novelty

00:48:39.120 --> 00:48:41.510
of touring by automobile.

00:48:41.510 --> 00:48:44.370
He gave speeches and
shared his initial ideas

00:48:44.370 --> 00:48:46.730
then returned to his office in Chicago

00:48:46.730 --> 00:48:49.580
to think about the city
for several more weeks,

00:48:49.580 --> 00:48:52.550
then requested that upon his return

00:48:52.550 --> 00:48:54.750
he be provided with an office

00:48:54.750 --> 00:48:58.040
in a structure atop Twin Peaks

00:48:58.040 --> 00:49:00.390
so that he could be
where the, and I quote,

00:49:00.390 --> 00:49:03.500
from Burnham now, where
the influence about me

00:49:03.500 --> 00:49:06.363
shall stimulate Golden Gate thoughts.

00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:10.060
Downtown, Burnham thought, would not do

00:49:10.060 --> 00:49:11.420
since he needed a place where he could

00:49:11.420 --> 00:49:15.190
see and grasp the city's
remarkable landscape

00:49:15.190 --> 00:49:16.483
in its entirety.

00:49:18.650 --> 00:49:21.150
Weeks and weeks of deep engagement

00:49:21.150 --> 00:49:23.440
and a desire to have a
big picture of the city

00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:25.253
in front of him at all times.

00:49:26.270 --> 00:49:29.210
So what did Burnham
produce the following year

00:49:29.210 --> 00:49:32.023
when his plan for San
Francisco was finished?

00:49:33.010 --> 00:49:34.730
A plan whose most significant element

00:49:34.730 --> 00:49:37.470
was the Civic Center, the
area at Market and Van Ness

00:49:37.470 --> 00:49:41.840
where City Hall and other
civic structures are clustered.

00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:46.010
And the place that I think
all of us would agree

00:49:46.010 --> 00:49:48.580
is just about the least
San Francisco-like part

00:49:48.580 --> 00:49:52.540
of the entire city,
whatever its other virtues.

00:49:52.540 --> 00:49:54.210
Burnham was trained in the Beaux-Arts

00:49:54.210 --> 00:49:56.450
and he liked its grand classical buildings

00:49:56.450 --> 00:49:59.030
and formal axial boulevards.

00:49:59.030 --> 00:50:02.690
He proposed several wide diagonal avenues

00:50:02.690 --> 00:50:05.500
for San Francisco that,
unlike the Civic Center,

00:50:05.500 --> 00:50:06.383
were never built.

00:50:07.970 --> 00:50:10.590
There's another irony to
Daniel Burnham's involvement

00:50:10.590 --> 00:50:13.430
in San Francisco, which
is that the element

00:50:13.430 --> 00:50:15.950
in the city that he most disliked

00:50:15.950 --> 00:50:17.490
and wished to obliterate,

00:50:17.490 --> 00:50:21.143
though he knew he couldn't
was the city street grid.

00:50:22.090 --> 00:50:24.070
It denied the special qualities

00:50:24.070 --> 00:50:26.750
of the city's great
Hills, Burnham thought,

00:50:26.750 --> 00:50:29.070
and he pretended that the city's,

00:50:29.070 --> 00:50:32.230
oh no, and rather and he believed the grid

00:50:33.150 --> 00:50:36.050
pretended that the city's
magnificent topography

00:50:36.050 --> 00:50:37.223
did not exist.

00:50:38.090 --> 00:50:40.310
By rejecting the city's straight streets

00:50:40.310 --> 00:50:43.330
even knowing he was stuck
with most of them anyway,

00:50:43.330 --> 00:50:45.340
Burnham thought that he was proving

00:50:45.340 --> 00:50:46.700
how well he understood the city

00:50:46.700 --> 00:50:48.360
and how much his plan

00:50:48.360 --> 00:50:51.370
spoke to San Francisco's unique nature,

00:50:51.370 --> 00:50:55.540
how much it was not
generic in other words.

00:50:55.540 --> 00:50:57.200
But as all of you know,

00:50:57.200 --> 00:50:59.070
the relentlessness of the grid

00:50:59.070 --> 00:51:02.170
across San Francisco striking topography

00:51:03.140 --> 00:51:06.190
is in itself one of the key elements

00:51:06.190 --> 00:51:07.960
of the city's identity.

00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:12.080
It provides a kind of drama
that exists nowhere else

00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:15.130
and makes real and
powerful the juxtaposition

00:51:15.130 --> 00:51:19.293
of the man-made world and
an unusual natural feature.

00:51:20.440 --> 00:51:24.950
Paradoxically, if the grid
could've been made to disappear

00:51:24.950 --> 00:51:26.900
and Burnham's preferred plan

00:51:26.900 --> 00:51:29.430
for curving contoured roadways

00:51:29.430 --> 00:51:31.260
wrapping around the hills

00:51:31.260 --> 00:51:35.100
and gradually climbing up them
had been brought into being,

00:51:35.100 --> 00:51:37.930
San Francisco might have
felt less distinctive

00:51:37.930 --> 00:51:40.110
not more distinctive.

00:51:40.110 --> 00:51:45.060
Sometimes the best way to play
to the character of a place

00:51:45.060 --> 00:51:47.210
is to do the conventional thing

00:51:47.210 --> 00:51:49.093
where it might be least expected.

00:51:50.520 --> 00:51:53.637
Still, Burnham's deep
engagement with San Francisco

00:51:53.637 --> 00:51:56.110
and his sincere attempt

00:51:56.110 --> 00:51:58.650
to respond to its unique qualities,

00:51:58.650 --> 00:52:01.153
whether or not he
succeeded, can't be doubted.

00:52:02.170 --> 00:52:03.660
And this could not be more different

00:52:03.660 --> 00:52:05.440
from how things work today,

00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:08.870
with architects flying in and flying out.

00:52:08.870 --> 00:52:11.890
Today, Burnham would have
flown to San Francisco

00:52:11.890 --> 00:52:15.240
from his home in Chicago,
been given a helicopter tour

00:52:15.240 --> 00:52:18.910
and been back home in
Chicago the next day,

00:52:18.910 --> 00:52:21.420
or maybe on to Singapore.

00:52:21.420 --> 00:52:25.380
And we all would have seen his
proposals for San Francisco

00:52:25.380 --> 00:52:27.833
the moment they came out of his computer.

00:52:28.750 --> 00:52:32.080
Unlike in 1905, when he presented his plan

00:52:32.080 --> 00:52:35.500
in the form of an
elaborately printed book,

00:52:35.500 --> 00:52:38.160
drawings and models that were unveiled

00:52:38.160 --> 00:52:41.963
at a formal banquet at
the St. Francis Hotel.

00:52:43.250 --> 00:52:46.780
Now, of course, designs
are created quickly

00:52:46.780 --> 00:52:48.560
and distributed even more quickly.

00:52:48.560 --> 00:52:50.970
Everyone sees images of
new buildings instantly

00:52:50.970 --> 00:52:53.990
on Instagram and Twitter
and everywhere else.

00:52:53.990 --> 00:52:56.260
You hardly have to wait months or years

00:52:56.260 --> 00:52:57.913
to learn what is getting built.

00:52:59.220 --> 00:53:01.330
This means that if you were
a real estate developer

00:53:01.330 --> 00:53:03.000
who wants to make a mark,

00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:04.853
you want the latest thing instantly.

00:53:06.370 --> 00:53:10.423
Architecture has never
been immune from fashion,

00:53:11.450 --> 00:53:14.420
but it seems more tightly
bound to trend today

00:53:14.420 --> 00:53:16.220
than ever before.

00:53:16.220 --> 00:53:18.490
I think it's important to say again,

00:53:18.490 --> 00:53:22.490
that it's not just because
of famous architects

00:53:22.490 --> 00:53:24.960
that too many buildings in too many cities

00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:25.833
look the same.

00:53:28.090 --> 00:53:30.200
The vast forces of globalization

00:53:30.200 --> 00:53:33.060
push relentlessly toward homogenization,

00:53:33.060 --> 00:53:37.260
and most cities are
powerless to push back.

00:53:37.260 --> 00:53:40.830
On the rare occasions when
they do push back successfully,

00:53:40.830 --> 00:53:42.470
it's often the celebrated architects

00:53:42.470 --> 00:53:45.050
who provide the best alternative

00:53:45.050 --> 00:53:48.050
to standard-issue commercial banality,

00:53:48.050 --> 00:53:50.600
who do the pushing back, so to speak.

00:53:50.600 --> 00:53:52.070
And if that comes in the form

00:53:52.070 --> 00:53:55.100
of somewhat similar
buildings from city to city,

00:53:55.100 --> 00:53:59.533
we need to remember that
this is not a new phenomenon.

00:54:01.830 --> 00:54:05.863
So am I saying, therefore,
that generic is okay?

00:54:06.882 --> 00:54:09.663
That it is just something
we learn to live with?

00:54:10.900 --> 00:54:14.890
No, despite the fact that generic

00:54:14.890 --> 00:54:17.550
was not invented in our time,

00:54:17.550 --> 00:54:19.940
that doesn't make it desirable.

00:54:19.940 --> 00:54:22.240
I don't think that
acknowledging the enormity

00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:24.380
of the forces of globalization

00:54:24.380 --> 00:54:26.890
and recognizing that they are too large

00:54:26.890 --> 00:54:29.710
for any city fully to resist,

00:54:29.710 --> 00:54:32.010
therefore means that we have to lie down

00:54:32.010 --> 00:54:33.463
and play dead before them.

00:54:34.410 --> 00:54:37.350
We want places to feel distinctive.

00:54:37.350 --> 00:54:38.820
Believing that you are in a place

00:54:38.820 --> 00:54:41.040
that is not entirely like other places

00:54:41.040 --> 00:54:44.080
is important not only
for the places themselves

00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:45.023
but for us.

00:54:46.020 --> 00:54:48.240
We receive a critical part of our identity

00:54:49.430 --> 00:54:53.170
from where we are, most
importantly from where we live,

00:54:53.170 --> 00:54:56.320
but also from where we are
even for brief periods.

00:54:56.320 --> 00:54:59.250
If every place looks and feels the same

00:54:59.250 --> 00:55:04.250
then we are to a degree,
perhaps more than we wish,

00:55:05.290 --> 00:55:06.903
also the same.

00:55:09.380 --> 00:55:12.260
Cities need to play to their strengths

00:55:12.260 --> 00:55:14.680
if they are to retain a sense of identity,

00:55:14.680 --> 00:55:17.400
which is to say that
they need to recognize

00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:20.620
what it is that they have
that makes them distinctive

00:55:20.620 --> 00:55:22.980
even if all are not in a position

00:55:22.980 --> 00:55:26.823
to become quite as
distinctive as San Francisco.

00:55:27.730 --> 00:55:30.290
Knowing what to do of
course is another matter.

00:55:30.290 --> 00:55:33.380
As Daniel Burnham's
miscalculation 110 years ago

00:55:33.380 --> 00:55:36.410
reminds us, it is possible to understand

00:55:36.410 --> 00:55:38.790
and respect the essence of a place

00:55:38.790 --> 00:55:41.553
and still come up with
the wrong response to it.

00:55:42.500 --> 00:55:46.040
A more contemporary example
might be up the coast

00:55:46.040 --> 00:55:48.920
in Vancouver, which as you surely know,

00:55:48.920 --> 00:55:52.100
is an exceptionally pleasant City.

00:55:52.100 --> 00:55:53.570
It has a beautiful waterfront,

00:55:53.570 --> 00:55:57.950
expansive parks, appealing
downtown neighborhoods

00:55:57.950 --> 00:55:59.883
and jaw-dropping scenery.

00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:04.530
The breathtaking mountains
are, by and large,

00:56:04.530 --> 00:56:07.210
protected from overdevelopment.

00:56:07.210 --> 00:56:10.610
The only thing the place
lacks is architecture

00:56:10.610 --> 00:56:14.300
that you can remember for
more than five minutes.

00:56:14.300 --> 00:56:17.300
The city's skyline filled with
gleaming new office towers

00:56:17.300 --> 00:56:20.783
and high-rise condominiums is deadly dull.

00:56:21.770 --> 00:56:24.130
Vancouver does all the right things.

00:56:24.130 --> 00:56:27.430
It's planners really do
understand urban design

00:56:27.430 --> 00:56:30.200
and they know how to make
streets in public places.

00:56:30.200 --> 00:56:32.300
They believe in density,

00:56:32.300 --> 00:56:34.890
and they believe in walkability,

00:56:34.890 --> 00:56:37.260
two critical elements for a city,

00:56:37.260 --> 00:56:40.970
and it's a joy to walk
around Downtown Vancouver

00:56:40.970 --> 00:56:43.320
which is more than you
can say for many cities.

00:56:44.370 --> 00:56:46.290
But why is it not an equal joy

00:56:46.290 --> 00:56:48.340
to look at the skyline?

00:56:48.340 --> 00:56:52.210
Why in this place that
is itself so distinctive

00:56:52.210 --> 00:56:54.253
is the skyline so generic?

00:56:56.690 --> 00:56:59.870
if the lesson the San Francisco
Street Grid teaches us

00:56:59.870 --> 00:57:03.890
is that it is sometimes
necessary to be counterintuitive

00:57:03.890 --> 00:57:07.480
and to juxtapose the plainest
and most conventional thing

00:57:07.480 --> 00:57:09.920
with an unconventional context.

00:57:09.920 --> 00:57:13.380
I think the lesson Vancouver
offers is different.

00:57:13.380 --> 00:57:17.380
It is that you need architecture
at least some of the time.

00:57:17.380 --> 00:57:19.440
If streets are more
important than buildings

00:57:19.440 --> 00:57:23.270
to making a city work,
and I absolutely believe

00:57:23.270 --> 00:57:27.430
that they are, architecture still matters,

00:57:27.430 --> 00:57:30.563
and something somewhere
has to be memorable.

00:57:31.890 --> 00:57:35.800
Now Vancouver has no risk
of becoming truly generic.

00:57:35.800 --> 00:57:39.290
Its scenery, not to
mention its benign climate,

00:57:39.290 --> 00:57:42.400
ever-present waterfront and wonderful food

00:57:42.400 --> 00:57:45.930
will always save it from
falling into the chasm

00:57:45.930 --> 00:57:47.660
of the ordinary.

00:57:47.660 --> 00:57:49.610
But most of the architecture of that city

00:57:49.610 --> 00:57:53.000
puts the majesty of the
scenery to the test.

00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:56.150
When you have your back to
the water and the mountains

00:57:56.150 --> 00:57:59.073
you are no longer in a distinctive place.

00:58:01.380 --> 00:58:04.450
Creatively responding
to what is distinctive

00:58:04.450 --> 00:58:08.380
about the culture or the
physical setting of a city

00:58:08.380 --> 00:58:11.720
is the first way that a
city can resist the push

00:58:11.720 --> 00:58:13.630
toward the generic.

00:58:13.630 --> 00:58:16.980
But as we've seen in both
San Francisco and Vancouver,

00:58:16.980 --> 00:58:19.870
it is not always eager to figure out

00:58:19.870 --> 00:58:21.693
what that response should be.

00:58:23.120 --> 00:58:27.300
What goes hand-in-hand with
these things is preservation,

00:58:27.300 --> 00:58:29.370
holding on to what you have,

00:58:29.370 --> 00:58:31.500
knowing it will become
all the more precious

00:58:31.500 --> 00:58:35.083
as time goes on because
it cannot be recreated.

00:58:36.110 --> 00:58:38.940
Historic preservation
increasingly means neighborhoods

00:58:38.940 --> 00:58:42.870
not single buildings,
which often looks forlorn

00:58:42.870 --> 00:58:46.010
not to say ridiculous when they are adrift

00:58:46.010 --> 00:58:48.083
in a city of utterly different things.

00:58:49.030 --> 00:58:50.780
We could spend an entire afternoon

00:58:50.780 --> 00:58:53.710
talking only about issues
of historic preservation,

00:58:53.710 --> 00:58:56.030
so let me say here only that since we know

00:58:56.030 --> 00:58:59.200
it is becoming harder and
harder to create places

00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:03.130
that are distinctive and that
the natural order of things

00:59:03.130 --> 00:59:04.793
does not bring us to them.

00:59:05.720 --> 00:59:08.830
We have all the more
obligation to protect those

00:59:08.830 --> 00:59:11.270
that have been handed down to us,

00:59:11.270 --> 00:59:14.830
to learn from them yes,
but less to preserve them

00:59:14.830 --> 00:59:19.130
like precious hothouse orchids
and more to integrate them

00:59:19.130 --> 00:59:20.333
into modern life.

00:59:22.890 --> 00:59:26.020
And then of course a
city needs to be willing

00:59:26.020 --> 00:59:28.343
to trust in architecture to help.

00:59:29.490 --> 00:59:32.220
It cannot save the day, but it can

00:59:32.220 --> 00:59:35.230
make an extraordinary difference.

00:59:35.230 --> 00:59:37.700
I am saying this not to give a free pass

00:59:37.700 --> 00:59:40.630
to famous architects, but to acknowledge

00:59:40.630 --> 00:59:43.970
that while making a coherent whole

00:59:43.970 --> 00:59:48.230
and making civilized
decent background buildings

00:59:48.230 --> 00:59:50.513
is the greatest mission of urban design,

00:59:51.610 --> 00:59:54.993
even the best urban fabric is not enough.

00:59:56.040 --> 00:59:58.180
We also need exciting special buildings

00:59:58.180 --> 01:00:00.370
that excite the emotions.

01:00:00.370 --> 01:00:02.400
Those buildings that, as the critic

01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:05.130
and historian Lewis Mumford wrote,

01:00:05.130 --> 01:00:07.600
caused people to hold their breath

01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:10.630
for a stabbing moment or that restore them

01:00:10.630 --> 01:00:13.440
to equilibrium by offering them

01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:18.023
a prospect of space and
form joyfully mastered.

01:00:19.010 --> 01:00:23.660
Yes, if you try to make an
entire city of such buildings

01:00:23.660 --> 01:00:26.670
the result is chaos, but that hardly means

01:00:26.670 --> 01:00:28.270
that we don't need some of them.

01:00:29.370 --> 01:00:32.330
One of the silliest
aspects of the backlash

01:00:32.330 --> 01:00:36.850
against star architects is
its implicit presumption

01:00:36.850 --> 01:00:40.050
that if you think that
special one-of-a-kind

01:00:40.050 --> 01:00:42.180
distinctive buildings are good,

01:00:42.180 --> 01:00:43.920
then you must think that every building

01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:45.020
ought to be like that.

01:00:46.100 --> 01:00:49.460
And since every building
should not be like that

01:00:49.460 --> 01:00:53.580
then the logic goes, no
building should be like that,

01:00:53.580 --> 01:00:55.653
no building should be exceptional.

01:00:57.570 --> 01:00:59.373
Nothing could be more ridiculous.

01:01:00.430 --> 01:01:03.610
Of course, Frank Gehry is
not a model for anything

01:01:03.610 --> 01:01:07.000
except Frank Gehry and
his buildings work best

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:08.750
when they have the chance to play off

01:01:08.750 --> 01:01:10.780
against the everyday buildings

01:01:10.780 --> 01:01:13.230
that make up the urban fabric.

01:01:13.230 --> 01:01:14.920
But we are in danger these days

01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:17.920
of losing our belief in special buildings.

01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:21.470
Largely, I think, because we
have asked too much of them.

01:01:21.470 --> 01:01:23.730
We've asked them to
shoulder the entire burden

01:01:23.730 --> 01:01:27.683
of making cities, and they
cannot and should not do that.

01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:31.820
When did believing in the urban fabric

01:01:32.970 --> 01:01:35.470
and believing in the
ability of architecture

01:01:35.470 --> 01:01:39.950
to bring us special
exhilarating intense moments

01:01:39.950 --> 01:01:42.143
become incompatible with each other.

01:01:43.450 --> 01:01:45.100
We have got to begin to believe

01:01:45.100 --> 01:01:47.520
in both of these things again.

01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:49.080
Every city needs to be a place

01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:51.610
in which the basic idea of urban fabric

01:01:51.610 --> 01:01:53.220
of streets and public places

01:01:53.220 --> 01:01:56.010
and decent but not
spectacular architecture

01:01:56.010 --> 01:01:57.573
forms the foundation.

01:01:59.640 --> 01:02:02.880
But if that is all we have,
and if we lose our desire

01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:04.610
for great and special buildings

01:02:04.610 --> 01:02:06.580
that break out of all of this

01:02:06.580 --> 01:02:09.483
then we have failed our
cities just as much.

01:02:10.580 --> 01:02:14.300
The generic city is not only the place

01:02:14.300 --> 01:02:18.473
with identical glass towers
and freeways and malls.

01:02:19.460 --> 01:02:22.780
It is also the place that stops caring

01:02:22.780 --> 01:02:25.040
about things that are different

01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:28.280
and no longer builds
buildings that break the rules

01:02:28.280 --> 01:02:32.060
and make you feel that you are in a place

01:02:32.060 --> 01:02:33.773
that is like no place else.

01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:39.840
And that, the feeling of
being in a special place,

01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:44.578
is one of the greatest gifts
that any city can give us.

01:02:44.578 --> 01:02:45.702
Thank you.

01:02:45.702 --> 01:02:48.702
(audience applauds)

01:02:51.698 --> 01:02:52.531
Thank you.

01:02:58.945 --> 01:03:01.474
- [Mary] Thank you very
much, thank you very much.

01:03:01.474 --> 01:03:02.410
- Thank you.

01:03:02.410 --> 01:03:04.940
- [Mary] Thank you Paul,
that was a wonderful lecture

01:03:04.940 --> 01:03:08.050
and we will have some
time for a few questions.

01:03:08.050 --> 01:03:11.910
We would ask people to keep
their questions relatively brief

01:03:11.910 --> 01:03:14.030
so that everybody can have a chance.

01:03:14.030 --> 01:03:15.990
And I will just put the microphone here

01:03:15.990 --> 01:03:18.193
and please ask your questions at the mic.

01:03:23.390 --> 01:03:26.190
- Hope we didn't answer every
possible question in this.

01:03:30.230 --> 01:03:31.700
- [Woman] I'll take a quick stab.

01:03:31.700 --> 01:03:33.170
- Sure.

01:03:33.170 --> 01:03:34.610
- [Woman] You're talking about,

01:03:34.610 --> 01:03:37.340
you mentioned mediocre architecture

01:03:37.340 --> 01:03:39.440
and not that you need to go on,

01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:41.140
I think we know what you're talking about.

01:03:41.140 --> 01:03:46.140
But what about the term
vernacular architecture.

01:03:46.660 --> 01:03:47.740
Could you talk about that a little bit.

01:03:47.740 --> 01:03:51.730
- Sure, it's a good,
that's actually a word

01:03:51.730 --> 01:03:53.340
that I could have been should have

01:03:53.340 --> 01:03:56.100
probably woven into this somewhere.

01:03:56.100 --> 01:03:59.253
The term vernacular
architecture, which is,

01:03:59.253 --> 01:04:02.603
this sort of meaning the
common everyday language.

01:04:05.240 --> 01:04:08.560
What I was saying, even though I wasn't

01:04:08.560 --> 01:04:11.520
clever enough to put it
in exactly these words,

01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:16.030
was that in fact we lack
a good vernacular today

01:04:16.030 --> 01:04:17.830
and other periods had it.

01:04:17.830 --> 01:04:20.310
I mean the great failure
of modern architecture

01:04:20.310 --> 01:04:22.700
is not an inability to
make great buildings

01:04:22.700 --> 01:04:24.050
it makes plenty of them,

01:04:24.050 --> 01:04:27.433
it has never made a successful vernacular.

01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:35.040
If you look at the Victorian architecture

01:04:35.870 --> 01:04:39.670
of San Francisco, the
brownstones of New York,

01:04:39.670 --> 01:04:42.163
the Georgian architecture of London,

01:04:43.690 --> 01:04:45.830
even the most ordinary buildings

01:04:45.830 --> 01:04:47.540
in that vernacular were wonderful

01:04:47.540 --> 01:04:50.273
and they made a civilized
and beautiful city together.

01:04:51.170 --> 01:04:56.170
We have not been able to create
a modern equivalent of that.

01:04:58.080 --> 01:05:01.970
So I think that, in many
ways, is our greatest problem

01:05:01.970 --> 01:05:04.930
and I think it is also one of the reasons

01:05:04.930 --> 01:05:06.770
that the preservation movement

01:05:07.690 --> 01:05:11.810
grew as large and as
important a factor as it is

01:05:11.810 --> 01:05:15.323
in the sort of culture
of building let's say.

01:05:16.710 --> 01:05:19.500
I mean the deep dark secret
is how much preservation

01:05:19.500 --> 01:05:23.150
is motivated not by love
of what is being saved

01:05:23.150 --> 01:05:25.922
but by fear of what might
replace it, in fact.

01:05:25.922 --> 01:05:28.821
(audience laughs)

01:05:28.821 --> 01:05:31.400
That's, so anyway, yes sir.

01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:33.950
- [Man] You talked about
buildings they are too big,

01:05:33.950 --> 01:05:35.780
could you expand on that concept?

01:05:35.780 --> 01:05:37.530
- About buildings that are too big.

01:05:39.720 --> 01:05:42.490
I did talk about buildings
that are too big.

01:05:42.490 --> 01:05:45.140
I did not mean by that to suggest

01:05:45.140 --> 01:05:48.423
that there is not a place for
very, very large buildings.

01:05:49.550 --> 01:05:53.030
But only that the average new building

01:05:53.030 --> 01:05:57.000
that so much that is being
built today is so big

01:05:59.510 --> 01:06:04.510
that we have we have seen a
significant change in scale

01:06:05.090 --> 01:06:10.090
in our cities, and that
is an enormous challenge.

01:06:12.444 --> 01:06:14.050
I actually love skyscrapers.

01:06:14.050 --> 01:06:15.130
I wrote a book about them.

01:06:15.130 --> 01:06:16.473
I love tall buildings.

01:06:18.039 --> 01:06:19.550
Some of my very favorite
things in the world

01:06:19.550 --> 01:06:22.460
are very, very tall, very,
very large buildings.

01:06:22.460 --> 01:06:25.740
I am not, that was not a cover

01:06:25.740 --> 01:06:29.423
for everything should be six stories high.

01:06:30.798 --> 01:06:32.260
I was not saying that at all.

01:06:32.260 --> 01:06:37.260
But there is a a sense of balance

01:06:37.510 --> 01:06:40.430
in a city and we have lost that

01:06:40.430 --> 01:06:42.630
in so many of our downtowns now.

01:06:42.630 --> 01:06:45.890
That's all I meant to say by that point.

01:06:45.890 --> 01:06:48.840
- [Man] So actually I
question along a similar line

01:06:48.840 --> 01:06:51.850
which is you were
mentioning that there were,

01:06:51.850 --> 01:06:56.850
and there certainly are,
cities full of buildings

01:06:56.880 --> 01:06:59.620
that you felt are too big and too many

01:06:59.620 --> 01:07:02.870
and often too much the same.

01:07:02.870 --> 01:07:05.350
But what I was wondering is
what the alternative was,

01:07:05.350 --> 01:07:08.780
so I presume the alternative
is having an enormous number

01:07:08.780 --> 01:07:10.620
of smaller buildings.

01:07:10.620 --> 01:07:13.760
And I wonder whether it could be hard

01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:15.270
to have much distinctiveness

01:07:15.270 --> 01:07:18.050
if you had that many smaller buildings

01:07:18.050 --> 01:07:20.950
or whether when you have the investment

01:07:20.950 --> 01:07:23.990
in a big building you
can get the starchitect

01:07:23.990 --> 01:07:26.433
to build something distinctive.

01:07:27.410 --> 01:07:31.870
- You know, San Francisco,
I don't mean to sort of

01:07:31.870 --> 01:07:34.850
make this all that local a talk

01:07:34.850 --> 01:07:35.850
and yet on the other hand

01:07:35.850 --> 01:07:37.810
I do have to go back to think about

01:07:37.810 --> 01:07:41.700
how reasonably successful
San Francisco has been

01:07:41.700 --> 01:07:46.700
in creating a sort of urban vernacular

01:07:47.050 --> 01:07:52.050
of small to medium size
urban buildings in downtown,

01:07:52.650 --> 01:07:54.840
many of which are really extremely decent,

01:07:54.840 --> 01:07:56.910
some of which are more than that

01:07:56.910 --> 01:07:59.310
and in which modern architecture

01:07:59.310 --> 01:08:02.050
does begin to have a certain degree

01:08:02.050 --> 01:08:04.220
of life and vibrancy to it,

01:08:04.220 --> 01:08:07.013
and yet still be quite urbane.

01:08:07.970 --> 01:08:10.850
In general, I think you do,
though, make a better city

01:08:10.850 --> 01:08:14.330
with more dense lower buildings.

01:08:14.330 --> 01:08:16.100
I mean look at Paris for example,

01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:21.073
not that we're going to ever
remake our cities that way.

01:08:21.947 --> 01:08:26.320
But it's awfully nice when it happens.

01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:28.480
But of course that alone
is not enough either

01:08:28.480 --> 01:08:32.460
because if you look at
much of Washington D.C.,

01:08:32.460 --> 01:08:36.560
it is also eight story buildings
built out to the street

01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:40.600
and it's pretty dreary, most of it.

01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:45.320
And so, I mean, who would rather walk,

01:08:45.320 --> 01:08:46.730
who wouldn't rather walk in Paris

01:08:46.730 --> 01:08:47.920
than Washington D.C.

01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:49.970
So there are many, many other factors

01:08:49.970 --> 01:08:52.103
that come into play here.

01:08:53.060 --> 01:08:54.520
I'm gonna talk actually about Paris

01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:57.350
and San Francisco some
more tomorrow as well.

01:08:57.350 --> 01:08:58.503
Yeah, Dick.

01:09:01.080 --> 01:09:03.140
- [Dick] So when I was
young in San Francisco

01:09:03.140 --> 01:09:05.560
we've referred to our two iconic banks

01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:08.520
as one was the Bank of Italy.

01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:09.353
- Right.

01:09:09.353 --> 01:09:10.970
- [Dick] And the other of
course was Wells Fargo.

01:09:10.970 --> 01:09:13.930
So a couple weeks ago I was
in Charlotte, North Carolina,

01:09:13.930 --> 01:09:16.060
and someone proudly pointed out

01:09:16.060 --> 01:09:19.890
that the hometown banks were Wells Fargo

01:09:19.890 --> 01:09:23.110
and Bank of America that now dominates.

01:09:23.110 --> 01:09:26.260
And it got me thinking
about, wherever I go

01:09:26.260 --> 01:09:28.570
I have this, we all have this presence

01:09:28.570 --> 01:09:31.730
of enormous wealth
that's being moved around

01:09:31.730 --> 01:09:34.300
and it's one more way that the,

01:09:34.300 --> 01:09:36.610
because wealth dictates
a lot of the buildings

01:09:36.610 --> 01:09:40.600
that go in, and how this is shaping

01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:43.380
this homogenization of
everything around us.

01:09:43.380 --> 01:09:46.510
So I just wanna maybe
reflect on what you just said

01:09:46.510 --> 01:09:48.350
and think about it a
little more if you would.

01:09:48.350 --> 01:09:50.970
- Sure, actually tomorrow I'm gonna talk

01:09:50.970 --> 01:09:52.710
a certain amount about

01:09:56.220 --> 01:09:59.170
the sort of massive
movement of global capital

01:09:59.170 --> 01:10:03.160
creating these sort of huge things

01:10:03.160 --> 01:10:06.230
that seem to really be
commodity investments

01:10:06.230 --> 01:10:10.363
more than buildings
often, and what it means.

01:10:15.240 --> 01:10:17.250
The fact that the Bank of America

01:10:17.250 --> 01:10:20.267
which was once the Bank
of Italy in San Francisco

01:10:20.267 --> 01:10:22.750
and is now the Bank of
America in Charlotte,

01:10:22.750 --> 01:10:27.600
and Wells Fargo, is in
fact as good a reminder

01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:32.600
as you can about the the
fact that all of this

01:10:33.270 --> 01:10:35.970
is about the movement of global capital

01:10:35.970 --> 01:10:40.000
and the cities are just the byproduct

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:41.830
and sometimes the waste product (laughs)

01:10:41.830 --> 01:10:44.523
of that whole process.

01:10:46.870 --> 01:10:50.650
Although, you know of course it has things

01:10:50.650 --> 01:10:52.190
that make life easier for us

01:10:52.190 --> 01:10:53.850
as well as things that make us hard.

01:10:53.850 --> 01:10:56.270
I mean I Bank at Chase in New York

01:10:56.270 --> 01:10:57.970
and when I landed at the airport

01:10:57.970 --> 01:11:00.080
there was the Chase machine

01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:02.230
just like the one in New York

01:11:02.230 --> 01:11:06.520
and how did we ever live
without these things.

01:11:06.520 --> 01:11:10.700
So that it, there are so many ways

01:11:10.700 --> 01:11:14.940
in which this technology
and culture benefits us

01:11:14.940 --> 01:11:17.750
as well as challenges us.

01:11:17.750 --> 01:11:22.180
But, you know, it is so often

01:11:23.020 --> 01:11:24.360
the same people

01:11:27.890 --> 01:11:30.930
building the same things
with the same money

01:11:30.930 --> 01:11:33.680
and the same architects
for the same tenants

01:11:33.680 --> 01:11:35.140
in different places.

01:11:35.140 --> 01:11:40.140
That in some ways I wonder

01:11:41.200 --> 01:11:42.620
why are we surprised that things

01:11:42.620 --> 01:11:43.820
are coming out the same.

01:11:45.940 --> 01:11:48.120
But all of that said,
I think it's important

01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:50.750
to reflect on the point that I made

01:11:50.750 --> 01:11:53.560
about 19th and early
20th century buildings

01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:56.230
which was that we were building
a lot of similar things

01:11:56.230 --> 01:11:58.090
all over the place then too,

01:11:58.090 --> 01:12:00.133
and we were not so unhappy about it.

01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:06.080
So the notion that architecture,

01:12:06.850 --> 01:12:10.610
that architects and
builders do similar things

01:12:10.610 --> 01:12:13.080
at similar times in different places

01:12:13.080 --> 01:12:15.453
is not new to our time.

01:12:17.190 --> 01:12:21.940
But what is new to our time, I think,

01:12:21.940 --> 01:12:25.740
is a weakening of a local culture

01:12:26.660 --> 01:12:30.370
brought about in part
by the homogenization

01:12:30.370 --> 01:12:33.420
of global culture and technology

01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:39.640
that makes the places themselves less able

01:12:40.010 --> 01:12:45.010
to assert an identity, less
able to create an identity

01:12:45.370 --> 01:12:48.350
in the first place, than they were.

01:12:48.350 --> 01:12:51.400
And we will see how all this plays out

01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:54.463
but I'm not encouraged about that.

01:12:55.427 --> 01:12:57.060
I'm encouraged about a lot of individual

01:12:57.060 --> 01:12:58.890
works of architecture and not encouraged

01:12:58.890 --> 01:13:03.890
about our ability to make
places remain distinctive.

01:13:06.770 --> 01:13:07.700
So, anyway.

01:13:07.700 --> 01:13:08.533
Yes sir.

01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:10.923
- [Man] Hi, thank you.

01:13:11.990 --> 01:13:14.410
You framed your praise for localism

01:13:14.410 --> 01:13:16.867
with praise for walkability.

01:13:16.867 --> 01:13:17.789
- Right.

01:13:17.789 --> 01:13:20.610
- [Man] And this little city
has a history of innovation

01:13:20.610 --> 01:13:22.350
both culturally and architecturally

01:13:22.350 --> 01:13:23.440
to the point where Berkeley

01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:25.720
is kind of a shorthand for things

01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:28.350
and you were kind enough to
mention Maybeck's legacy.

01:13:28.350 --> 01:13:31.470
I would predict that if you
come back here in 10 years

01:13:31.470 --> 01:13:34.870
this city will be
unrecognizably homogenized

01:13:34.870 --> 01:13:38.430
by a lot of major development
that's being greenwashed

01:13:39.330 --> 01:13:44.250
with appeals to things like
walkability and livability.

01:13:44.250 --> 01:13:48.040
And it all seems to be
inspired by somewhere else

01:13:48.040 --> 01:13:51.730
by places like one word stereotypes

01:13:51.730 --> 01:13:54.360
like Portlandia or Park Slope

01:13:54.360 --> 01:13:56.100
and none of it's really rooted here.

01:13:56.100 --> 01:13:58.180
And I get around by bicycle,

01:13:58.180 --> 01:14:00.130
I'm wearing bicycle
clips just to frame this,

01:14:00.130 --> 01:14:02.810
but does does every place
have to be walkable?

01:14:02.810 --> 01:14:05.000
Does every place, is there a dark side

01:14:08.390 --> 01:14:10.130
to a good movement.

01:14:10.130 --> 01:14:13.453
- Now there's a great,
wonderfully perverse question.

01:14:14.306 --> 01:14:15.850
Does every place have to be walkable.

01:14:15.850 --> 01:14:18.813
I think that's a very
fair question to raise.

01:14:21.310 --> 01:14:24.110
First I would say we are
in very little danger

01:14:24.110 --> 01:14:26.430
of every place being walkable. (laughs)

01:14:26.430 --> 01:14:28.200
We should only be lucky enough

01:14:28.200 --> 01:14:30.750
for that to be the real
issue and the real problem.

01:14:36.190 --> 01:14:38.720
Every place is simply
never going to be walkable.

01:14:38.720 --> 01:14:42.090
But what I do see happening,

01:14:42.090 --> 01:14:44.340
and I think this is to the good,

01:14:44.340 --> 01:14:47.810
is a greater respect for the values

01:14:47.810 --> 01:14:52.810
that are inherent in
that word walkability,

01:14:53.960 --> 01:14:58.180
and to see it existing
in sort of nodal ways

01:14:58.180 --> 01:15:00.430
in lots of places that
are in a larger sense,

01:15:00.430 --> 01:15:02.220
in a macro sense, not walkable.

01:15:02.220 --> 01:15:05.363
Los Angeles is probably
the best example of that.

01:15:06.430 --> 01:15:08.740
I mean there are more neighborhoods today

01:15:08.740 --> 01:15:12.570
in Los Angeles that have a street life

01:15:12.570 --> 01:15:15.430
and are walkable than there used to be,

01:15:15.430 --> 01:15:18.730
in part, and here's the law
of unintended consequences,

01:15:18.730 --> 01:15:20.570
in part because traffic on the freeways

01:15:20.570 --> 01:15:23.170
has gotten so utterly unbearable

01:15:23.170 --> 01:15:25.500
that it was too much trouble to go across.

01:15:25.500 --> 01:15:27.480
I remember when I first
went to Los Angeles

01:15:27.480 --> 01:15:29.700
many, many years ago,
you would think nothing

01:15:29.700 --> 01:15:32.660
of zipping from Malibu to downtown

01:15:32.660 --> 01:15:34.970
and then back to Santa
Monica and then to Hollywood

01:15:34.970 --> 01:15:36.570
and so forth all within a day.

01:15:36.570 --> 01:15:39.390
Well it would take you
a week to do that now.

01:15:39.390 --> 01:15:43.980
So in fact, the unexpected
consequence of that

01:15:43.980 --> 01:15:47.970
is that more neighborhoods
now have good restaurants,

01:15:47.970 --> 01:15:51.113
good shopping, attractive streets,

01:15:53.250 --> 01:15:54.870
cultural facilities and so forth

01:15:54.870 --> 01:15:58.330
and the city is actually a set of nodes,

01:15:58.330 --> 01:16:00.330
many of which on a small scale

01:16:00.330 --> 01:16:02.820
for certain every day functions,

01:16:02.820 --> 01:16:06.930
function walkably but
then there's the overlay

01:16:06.930 --> 01:16:08.700
of the macrocity that people deal with

01:16:08.700 --> 01:16:09.650
in a different way.

01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:15.010
That's not a terrible
adaptation of a model.

01:16:15.010 --> 01:16:18.850
I mean it's a model we would not

01:16:18.850 --> 01:16:20.770
wanna create that way from scratch now

01:16:20.770 --> 01:16:24.113
but it's evolved in an interesting way.

01:16:25.660 --> 01:16:27.440
Does every place have
to look like Portland?

01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:29.030
I hope not.

01:16:29.030 --> 01:16:31.830
I think Portland is a lovely place

01:16:31.830 --> 01:16:35.050
but it would be a shame if everything

01:16:35.050 --> 01:16:38.223
sort of really did become like that.

01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:44.920
And you know Park Slope too.

01:16:44.920 --> 01:16:48.720
But I think, what you
make fun of in Park Slope

01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:50.630
is kind of the culture of it

01:16:50.630 --> 01:16:53.420
more than the physical fact of the place

01:16:54.300 --> 01:16:58.070
which is, and here's a good,
another interesting thing

01:16:58.070 --> 01:17:00.253
about a lot of traditional cities.

01:17:01.250 --> 01:17:05.890
Park Slope has a physical
fabric of brownstones,

01:17:05.890 --> 01:17:10.890
a park, a few special buildings

01:17:12.020 --> 01:17:15.260
but a larger fabric dominating everything

01:17:15.260 --> 01:17:17.760
and then a couple of
nice commercial streets,

01:17:17.760 --> 01:17:20.250
is a model for almost any kind of life

01:17:20.250 --> 01:17:21.820
and it works really well.

01:17:21.820 --> 01:17:25.560
It doesn't require the silliness

01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:27.430
of the Park Slope food cooperative

01:17:27.430 --> 01:17:28.880
or whatever all that stuff is

01:17:28.880 --> 01:17:32.550
that people make fun of there to exist.

01:17:32.550 --> 01:17:34.400
A different kind of life could also exist

01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:35.710
very fruitfully there.

01:17:35.710 --> 01:17:39.513
So I think it's also important not to,

01:17:41.270 --> 01:17:46.270
while we must never fail
to give proper credence

01:17:46.620 --> 01:17:51.620
to physical form and its
impact on life and culture,

01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:54.760
I think it's also a mistake to believe

01:17:54.760 --> 01:17:56.120
that it determines all.

01:17:56.120 --> 01:17:58.460
'Cause sometimes they just coexist

01:17:58.460 --> 01:18:03.430
without having quite as
much of a cause-and-effect

01:18:03.430 --> 01:18:04.600
relationship on each other.

01:18:04.600 --> 01:18:05.550
That's what I think.

01:18:05.550 --> 01:18:06.920
Yes sir.

01:18:06.920 --> 01:18:08.900
- [Man] So one of the great

01:18:08.900 --> 01:18:10.360
and probably justified criticisms

01:18:10.360 --> 01:18:12.380
of the starchitects of the last generation

01:18:12.380 --> 01:18:15.890
was their complete, the
way in which they ignored

01:18:15.890 --> 01:18:18.248
the street context and people,

01:18:18.248 --> 01:18:20.800
the big empty plaza and all that.

01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:22.460
Do you think the new generation

01:18:22.460 --> 01:18:25.110
of architects that you talked about,

01:18:25.110 --> 01:18:26.780
the star architects who
are going around the world

01:18:26.780 --> 01:18:31.270
are they still creating sculptures in situ

01:18:31.270 --> 01:18:33.963
or are they focusing more
on the life around them?

01:18:35.150 --> 01:18:40.150
- Well I don't think
that a sort of building

01:18:40.760 --> 01:18:45.330
that's a significant and
assertive piece of sculpture

01:18:45.330 --> 01:18:49.230
necessarily is anti-urban
and avoids the street.

01:18:49.230 --> 01:18:50.523
Some do, some don't.

01:18:52.150 --> 01:18:57.070
I've seen plenty that are
in fact quite sophisticated

01:18:57.070 --> 01:18:59.440
and subtle from an urbanistic standpoint.

01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:01.210
It all depends on the circumstances

01:19:01.210 --> 01:19:04.360
and who's doing it and
a million other things.

01:19:04.360 --> 01:19:07.980
But yes I see much more
consciousness of that today

01:19:07.980 --> 01:19:12.690
and much less comfort

01:19:12.690 --> 01:19:14.690
with either breaking away from the street

01:19:14.690 --> 01:19:17.400
or if you are making a public space,

01:19:17.400 --> 01:19:22.400
with making it cold and
unsociable let's say

01:19:24.270 --> 01:19:25.740
for want of a better term.

01:19:25.740 --> 01:19:28.620
I think the work of William H. Whyte,

01:19:28.620 --> 01:19:32.320
who I actually referred
to early in the talk

01:19:32.320 --> 01:19:34.760
was critical and I think
that has sort of been

01:19:34.760 --> 01:19:37.333
pretty much absorbed into the culture.

01:19:38.250 --> 01:19:41.240
I was going through the New Whitney Museum

01:19:41.240 --> 01:19:45.990
in New York the other day
and talking to the director

01:19:45.990 --> 01:19:48.710
and he was talking to me about this little

01:19:48.710 --> 01:19:53.273
sort of mini Piazza that
is at the front of it,

01:19:55.010 --> 01:19:57.520
between where you get
off the High Line Park

01:19:57.520 --> 01:20:00.080
and go into the museum, and he was saying,

01:20:00.080 --> 01:20:01.720
oh you know we're, he said,

01:20:01.720 --> 01:20:03.020
I'm sorry you're seeing it today

01:20:03.020 --> 01:20:04.760
'cause the chairs haven't arrived.

01:20:04.760 --> 01:20:07.130
We've ordered all these
chairs like they have

01:20:07.130 --> 01:20:09.660
in the Tourville in Paris,
these little light chairs

01:20:09.660 --> 01:20:11.960
that people can move
around any way they want.

01:20:13.440 --> 01:20:15.500
And he didn't even say, oh, you know,

01:20:15.500 --> 01:20:17.130
we've done this radical thing.

01:20:17.130 --> 01:20:18.360
He just sort of mentioned that

01:20:18.360 --> 01:20:20.260
as if that's what people do now.

01:20:20.260 --> 01:20:22.830
So I think that that
we have learned a lot.

01:20:22.830 --> 01:20:24.360
It doesn't mean we do everything right.

01:20:24.360 --> 01:20:28.833
But we, I think, have learned
more about public space

01:20:30.100 --> 01:20:31.350
than we had before.

01:20:31.350 --> 01:20:35.810
And architects, when they
are doing large-scale

01:20:35.810 --> 01:20:40.773
major projects, I think don't
try to convince the world

01:20:42.160 --> 01:20:46.750
that an acre of Travertine is
in everybody's best interest.

01:20:46.750 --> 01:20:48.163
Yes sir.

01:20:48.163 --> 01:20:51.850
- [Man] Inasmuch as you are speaking

01:20:51.850 --> 01:20:55.270
of the effect of good architecture

01:20:55.270 --> 01:21:00.270
and creating a sense of
uniqueness of a city,

01:21:00.670 --> 01:21:04.450
I'm surprised you haven't
mentioned Gaudi and Barcelona.

01:21:04.450 --> 01:21:08.083
Nothing could be more a perfect example.

01:21:08.970 --> 01:21:12.980
Gaudi, and I'm an architect,
and we toured that,

01:21:12.980 --> 01:21:15.770
spent days looking at Gaudi's stuff.

01:21:15.770 --> 01:21:16.690
Pure genius.

01:21:16.690 --> 01:21:19.260
I thought Frank Lloyd Wright was the tops

01:21:19.260 --> 01:21:21.681
but Gaudi is my man now.

01:21:21.681 --> 01:21:23.534
(audience laughs)

01:21:23.534 --> 01:21:26.182
And the other person is Calatrava.

01:21:26.182 --> 01:21:27.015
- [Woman] Oh yeah.

01:21:27.015 --> 01:21:28.630
- [Man] Very imaginative.

01:21:28.630 --> 01:21:33.130
And unlike Frank Gehry, who I
don't have much respect for,

01:21:33.130 --> 01:21:36.300
we did Bilbao, very, very good.

01:21:36.300 --> 01:21:38.840
Everything else seems hit and run

01:21:38.840 --> 01:21:43.090
where he does his shtick and
just sticks his wild stuff on.

01:21:43.090 --> 01:21:46.730
But the planning of the building itself

01:21:46.730 --> 01:21:47.743
is not good.

01:21:49.399 --> 01:21:52.970
- Well, I would agree with
you completely about Gaudi

01:21:52.970 --> 01:21:55.243
and yes I could certainly
have mentioned him.

01:21:57.791 --> 01:22:00.940
I didn't think so, but
I didn't think to do so,

01:22:00.940 --> 01:22:03.380
but, and the talk was
a little long as it was

01:22:03.380 --> 01:22:05.570
but you're absolutely right.

01:22:05.570 --> 01:22:07.770
It is completely
consistent with the points

01:22:07.770 --> 01:22:08.820
I was trying to make.

01:22:12.540 --> 01:22:13.660
There are actually many reasons

01:22:13.660 --> 01:22:18.660
why Barcelona is an extraordinary
and distinctive city.

01:22:18.790 --> 01:22:21.330
Gaudi is the most
important but also the plan

01:22:21.330 --> 01:22:24.380
with those chamfered corners
of that whole section

01:22:24.380 --> 01:22:26.750
there are many things
about it that are amazing

01:22:26.750 --> 01:22:29.923
of which Gaudi, as I
said, is the most eminent.

01:22:32.090 --> 01:22:33.820
I don't agree with you about Frank Gehry

01:22:33.820 --> 01:22:37.200
but that's a longer story
for another time. (laughs)

01:22:37.200 --> 01:22:40.050
And I think Walt Disney
Concert Hall in Los Angeles

01:22:40.050 --> 01:22:43.920
in particular is an extraordinary
and beautifully planned

01:22:43.920 --> 01:22:46.603
and eminently successful public building,

01:22:48.340 --> 01:22:50.450
particularly on the inside.

01:22:50.450 --> 01:22:53.640
But that will be another
another conversation

01:22:53.640 --> 01:22:55.260
for another time anyway.

01:22:55.260 --> 01:22:56.550
Yes sir.

01:22:56.550 --> 01:22:57.383
- [Man] Thank you very much,

01:22:57.383 --> 01:22:58.410
and I really enjoyed your talk.

01:22:58.410 --> 01:22:59.243
- Thank you.

01:22:59.243 --> 01:23:01.310
- [Man] I was fulfilled
and had no questions.

01:23:01.310 --> 01:23:04.770
And then your soliloquy here

01:23:04.770 --> 01:23:06.090
in the question and answer period

01:23:06.090 --> 01:23:10.850
discussing the flow of, massive
flows of capital, basically.

01:23:10.850 --> 01:23:12.120
Christopher Leinberger's arguments

01:23:12.120 --> 01:23:14.370
17 standard product types,

01:23:14.370 --> 01:23:17.320
because that's what's
financeable every day.

01:23:17.320 --> 01:23:19.980
In some ways anticipating your talk today,

01:23:19.980 --> 01:23:21.330
The Generic City, I thought

01:23:21.330 --> 01:23:23.420
that was gonna be the punch line.

01:23:23.420 --> 01:23:25.760
Can you tell me why
you didn't mention that

01:23:25.760 --> 01:23:27.803
in today's talk?

01:23:27.803 --> 01:23:29.260
- Why I didn't.
- Why you didn't.

01:23:29.260 --> 01:23:31.360
- Mention what's financeable?

01:23:31.360 --> 01:23:32.900
- [Man] Well yeah, the fact that

01:23:32.900 --> 01:23:34.940
what's what's financing the generic city

01:23:34.940 --> 01:23:37.500
is a sort of development mechanism

01:23:37.500 --> 01:23:41.030
which is standard across
the US and now globally.

01:23:41.030 --> 01:23:45.320
- I sort of took that almost
as implicit, that's why.

01:23:45.320 --> 01:23:46.703
I mean I don't disagree with you.

01:23:46.703 --> 01:23:48.716
- [Man] Yeah were very explicit afterwards

01:23:48.716 --> 01:23:50.940
and I agree with you, which is probably.

01:23:50.940 --> 01:23:52.770
- I mean I now, I hope I get a chance

01:23:52.770 --> 01:23:55.010
to do some version of
this talk somewhere else

01:23:55.010 --> 01:23:56.510
because all of you are very good editors

01:23:56.510 --> 01:23:59.540
and you're actually, you've
given me several points

01:23:59.540 --> 01:24:02.760
to sort of add in and in
fact, that's, you're right

01:24:02.760 --> 01:24:04.480
I think I probably should not have

01:24:04.480 --> 01:24:08.170
made that implicit, I should
have made it explicit,

01:24:08.170 --> 01:24:10.940
because it is absolutely right that

01:24:15.200 --> 01:24:19.290
the forces of finance
play a far greater role

01:24:19.290 --> 01:24:22.000
in shaping cities than architects do.

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:26.580
However, that said, the
nature of what is financeable

01:24:26.580 --> 01:24:28.640
has evolved and changed.

01:24:28.640 --> 01:24:31.950
And there was a time not all that long ago

01:24:31.950 --> 01:24:36.780
when a strange building by Zaha Hadid,

01:24:37.920 --> 01:24:41.900
Norman Foster, Jean
Nouvel, Frank Gehry even,

01:24:41.900 --> 01:24:43.973
was utterly unfinanceable.

01:24:44.990 --> 01:24:48.240
Frank Gehry is now doing condo towers

01:24:48.240 --> 01:24:51.670
for the Related Group,
the New York developer

01:24:51.670 --> 01:24:53.970
and has done other things.

01:24:53.970 --> 01:24:57.730
So that you, we have also watched

01:24:57.730 --> 01:25:01.080
some evolution in that world.

01:25:01.080 --> 01:25:04.790
It lags, obviously,
architectural creativity

01:25:04.790 --> 01:25:08.243
by quite a bit, but it has,

01:25:09.420 --> 01:25:12.060
it has been affected by architecture

01:25:12.060 --> 01:25:14.180
as much as it has affected architecture

01:25:14.180 --> 01:25:15.200
in the last few years.

01:25:15.200 --> 01:25:18.040
And I think that in itself
is a fascinating phenomenon

01:25:18.040 --> 01:25:23.040
which could be a talk in
itself as well, in fact.

01:25:23.329 --> 01:25:24.570
I'm gonna talk, as I said,
I said a little bit more

01:25:24.570 --> 01:25:27.913
about all this tomorrow
in another context.

01:25:28.820 --> 01:25:30.673
Thank you all very much again.

01:25:30.673 --> 01:25:31.506
(audience applauds)

01:25:31.506 --> 01:25:34.260
- [Mary] Yes, please join me
in thanking Paul Goldberger.

01:25:36.874 --> 01:25:39.957
(light upbeat music)
