00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:08.540
Hi, I'm Craig, and this is Crash Course Government and Politics, and today we're going to talk about where public opinion comes from.

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:14.800
It comes from my mind brain! And yours! And Stan's! Although no one really cares to hear from Stan's mind brain...

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.100
Just kidding Stan.
You're crying?

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.940
Political ideologies are specific to individuals,

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.700
but right now we're gonna try to explain the factors that shape public opinion in the aggregate,

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.140
which is a fancy word for, like, all the people.

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:34.900
[Theme Music]

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.000
A person's opinions on politics are very much grounded in their ideology:

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.860
whether they consider themselves liberal or conservative, but that doesn't mean they aren't susceptible to outside factors.

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.540
I get my opinions from PewDiePie.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:50.140
Three of the main influences on our political opinions are the government, private groups, A.K.A. interest groups, and the media.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.200
A.K.A. my T.V. and my Internet.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.980
There's a lot of debate about which of these is more effective, and like anything

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.020
a lot depends on the individual and the circumstances in which the group is trying to move public opinion.

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.360
Probably the biggest thing that the government can do to shape public opinion is to do things.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.280
Whether it's raising or lowering taxes, or invading other countries,

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.160
when the government does stuff,
we got opinions about it.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:14.640
More recently government inactivity, at least in terms of congressional lawmaking, has also had an impact on public opinion.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.060
It seems like Congress' approval ratings have gotten lower and lower as they pass fewer and fewer bills.

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.040
But aside from doing, or not doing, their jobs, the government actively shapes public opinion

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.280
by engaging in public relations maneuvers and manipulating the news cycle.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.480
Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.880
The President is especially good at controlling the news cycle since he can go on television whenever he wants.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.340
The idea that the President might be at the center of the news started in the 20th Century.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.260
Probably with Theodore Roosevelt, who saw the office of the presidency as a "bully pulpit".

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.240
But it really picked up steam with Franklin Roosevelt, who began the trend of presidents speaking directly to

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.000
the American people with his "fireside chats". These were direct appeals to Americans

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.800
to support the president's policies, and a classic example of presidential P.R.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.760
Since then, the government has gotten more sophisticated with its public relations,

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.340
although perhaps not more effective.

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.040
President Clinton was known for having a war room to coordinate his P.R. apparatus.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.120
But all the spin in the world didn't make Americans support his healthcare initiative.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:07.020
Presidents Bush and Obama have continued this trend, using public opinion polls to polish their images,

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.260
even trying to figure out what sort of vacations they should take.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.540
But as with Clinton, there's not a ton of evidence that their P.R. activities worked.

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.320
This probably has something to do with the changing media landscape,

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.800
which we will discuss in greater future episodes.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.760
One innovation that has not worked all that well are policy commercials known as video news releases.

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.860
President Bush in particular tried to sway public opinion by paying for P.R. pieces that

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.840
looked and sounded like news stories which made his policies sound good.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.840
This was especially true of his education policies.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.920
I'll leave it to you to decide whether you think "No Child Left Behind" was a success,

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.460
but the point is that you need to be very careful when watching news stories about actual polices these days.

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:44.220
There's also a historical explanation for why government efforts to create positive public opinion are less successful than we might think.

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.480
In the 1960's and 1970's, the Vietnam War and then the Watergate Scandal put a massive dent in the people's

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.280
trust in the government, which is understandable since government officials were lying about the war

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.240
and using the C.I.A. to spy on Americans.

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.380
I bet if you ask your parents, or maybe your grandparents, you'll hear a story about how much better

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.720
the government was back in the '50s and early '60s, but that might be a reflection of the

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.380
generally robust economy, and a Cold War consensus that criticizing the government

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.500
was unpatriotic, you communist sympathizer!

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.740
And if you're African-American the 1950's and early 1960's probably don't look so rosy either.

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:14.980
Thanks, Thought Bubble. This brings us to another point about public opinion generally:

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.780
It's highly reactive to current events, especially the economy,

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.560
or eagles being in your vicinity and you wanting to punch them.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.360
I don't think it's a coincidence that presidential and congressional approval ratings have been pretty low

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.920
during the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.460
I mean, Americans love to complain, but the six years following 2008 have seemed pretty awful.

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:35.900
Or maybe it has a lot to do with the other two primary influences on public opinion.

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.960
Private groups, especially organized interest groups, but also less-formally-political organizations like

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:44.140
churches, can have a significant effect on the way the public views government and its polices.

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.460
Any group with a particular interest in legislation can mount an advertising campaign

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:50.180
for or against a law, provided that they have the money to do so.

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.040
Sometimes these groups exist already, like the National Rifle Association,

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.760
which works hard to ensure that stringent regulations on firearms don't get passed.

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.400
Other times an interest group will grow up around a specific issue,

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.880
as often happens in states like California that feature ballot initiatives.

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.920
The growth of the Internet as a source of news, information, and advertising has

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.000
lowered the cost of public relations and makes it easier for specific interest groups to get their messages out.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.660
Like the time I Tumbled about how the dress was totally black and blue!

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.720
Often the group that's better at swaying public opinion has more money.

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.680
A great example of how an interest group with a lot of money and a single issue

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.460
can shape public opinion was the "Harry and Louise" ad campaign sponsored by

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.520
the Health Insurance Association of America. Or, hiyaah!

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.240
Over the course of a year in 1993 and 1994 the group sponsored 14 television ads

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.080
featuring a fictitious couple, Harry and Louise,  who fretted over the potentially calamitous consequences

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.000
of President Clinton's health care proposals.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.420
The ads cost between 14 and 20 million dollars, and are widely credited with helping move

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:44.720
public opinion against the Clinton health policy.

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:45.880
Some groups don't have as much money.

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.280
Public interest research groups often use volunteers or very low paid interns to go door to door

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.960
or stand in the street handing out information about issues that concern them, such as the environment.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:58.820
Both liberal and conservative groups sponsor "think tanks" that produce research intended to change people's minds.

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:02.180
On the right are groups like the Heritage Foundation and the American Enterprise Institute.

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.180
On the left you might have heard of the Brookings Institute.

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.020
All the information that's put out by various think tanks and interest groups

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.260
probably wouldn't have as big an impact if not for the third factor shaping public opinion: the media.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.600
Of the three, the media tends to be the most powerful force in shaping public opinion

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.840
because it's everywhere, and it's easy to access, and people look all nice

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.680
with their makeup and the flashy graphics make them seem real smart.

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.740
For most of us the news media is the lowest cost way to get our information that shapes our opinion.

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:28.720
The main way that the media shapes public opinion is by choosing what stories to cover and not cover.

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.820
It's pretty hard to have an opinion on a topic if you know nothing about it.

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:34.860
Although many would say it's getting easier and easier, at least on Twitter.

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.740
One way the media shapes what we know is through what is called "priming".

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:41.640
That's when you put a coat of primer on the house before you paint it. The paint sticks real good.

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:45.320
No. This is when the media prepares the public to take a particular view of an issue,

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.080
often through the amount of coverage it gives.

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:50.820
For example, if media outlets chose to focus on crime, they do a crime-prime,

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:54.500
then crime will become a greater concern to the public, and this might translate into more political action.

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:59.020
Closely related to priming is "framing", which is the way the media outlets choose to interpret an event for us.

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:00.880
The launch of Obamacare is a good example.

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:03.820
Some media outlets focused on the numbers of people who signed up for healthcare who

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:08.100
didn't previously have it, and some focused on the failure of the initial launch of healthcare.gov.

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:12.100
The point is the stories the media decides to tell about an issue inevitably change the way

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:13.480
the public thinks about that issue.

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:16.340
So that's a brief introduction to the way that government, private groups, and the media

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:19.560
can attempt to shape public opinion, and I know a lot of this seems like common sense,

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:22.860
but I think it's good to look closely at our opinions and to question where they come from.

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:25.680
This is especially true when it comes to the media, which is changing so fast

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:29.840
the political scientists are struggling to figure out what its effects on our political thinking might be.

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.700
This is good news for political scientists because it promises future employment,

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:36.560
but difficult for those of us trying to create videos that explain how the world of politics works.

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:39.420
Much of what I've told you here will probably change over the next few years,

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:45.600
but your ability to think about it shouldn't, as well as your ability to click on the video and play it.

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:48.300
And watch it again. Even though it's two years old. Thanks for watching! See you next time!
