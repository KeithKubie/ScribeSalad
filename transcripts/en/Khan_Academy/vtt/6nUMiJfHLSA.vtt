00:00:00.375 --> 00:00:02.326
- [Voiceover] We're told that triangle PIN

00:00:02.326 --> 00:00:06.411
is rotated negative 270
degrees about the origin.

00:00:06.411 --> 00:00:09.518
So this is the triangle PIN
and we're gonna rotate it

00:00:09.518 --> 00:00:12.419
negative 270 degrees about the origin.

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:16.390
Draw the image of this rotation
using the interactive graph.

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:18.666
The direction of rotation
by a positive angle

00:00:18.666 --> 00:00:20.291
is counter-clockwise.

00:00:20.291 --> 00:00:22.405
So positive is counter-clockwise,

00:00:22.405 --> 00:00:24.052
which is a standard convention,

00:00:24.052 --> 00:00:26.553
and this is negative, so a negative degree

00:00:26.553 --> 00:00:28.387
would be clockwise.

00:00:28.387 --> 00:00:29.897
And we want to use this tool here.

00:00:29.897 --> 00:00:32.492
And this tool, I can put points in,

00:00:32.492 --> 00:00:33.815
or I could delete points.

00:00:33.815 --> 00:00:35.674
I can draw a point by clicking on it.

00:00:35.674 --> 00:00:36.996
So what we want to do is think about,

00:00:36.996 --> 00:00:40.271
well look, if we rotate
the points of this triangle

00:00:40.271 --> 00:00:43.986
around the origin by negative 270 degrees,

00:00:43.986 --> 00:00:45.890
where is it gonna put these points?

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:47.191
And to help us think about that,

00:00:47.191 --> 00:00:49.940
I have copied and pasted
this on our scratch pad.

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:51.658
So actually let me go over here

00:00:51.658 --> 00:00:53.539
so I can actually draw on it.

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:55.187
So let's just first think
about what a negative

00:00:55.187 --> 00:00:58.415
270 degree rotation actually is.

00:00:58.415 --> 00:01:01.201
So if I were to start,

00:01:01.201 --> 00:01:02.315
if I were to,

00:01:02.315 --> 00:01:04.568
let me draw some coordinate axes here.

00:01:04.568 --> 00:01:06.843
So that's an x-axis and that's a y-axis.

00:01:06.843 --> 00:01:10.489
If you were to start right over here

00:01:10.489 --> 00:01:12.788
and you were to rotate around
the origin by negative,

00:01:12.788 --> 00:01:14.158
so this is the origin here,

00:01:14.158 --> 00:01:15.643
by negative 270 degrees,

00:01:15.643 --> 00:01:16.874
what would that be?

00:01:16.874 --> 00:01:20.389
Well let's see, this would
be rotating negative 90.

00:01:20.389 --> 00:01:23.826
This would be rotating
another negative 90,

00:01:23.826 --> 00:01:25.985
which would, together, be negative 180.

00:01:25.985 --> 00:01:28.238
And then this would be
another negative 90,

00:01:28.238 --> 00:01:29.886
which would give you in total,

00:01:29.886 --> 00:01:31.905
negative 270 degrees.

00:01:31.905 --> 00:01:34.367
That's negative 270 degrees.

00:01:34.367 --> 00:01:36.527
Now notice, that would
get that point here,

00:01:36.527 --> 00:01:38.663
which we could have also gotten there

00:01:38.663 --> 00:01:42.007
by just rotating it by
positive 90 degrees.

00:01:42.007 --> 00:01:43.817
We could have just said
that this is equivalent

00:01:43.817 --> 00:01:47.068
to a positive 90 degree rotation.

00:01:47.068 --> 00:01:49.064
So if they want us to
rotate the points here

00:01:49.064 --> 00:01:52.339
around the origin by negative 270 degrees,

00:01:52.339 --> 00:01:54.220
that's equivalent to just rotating

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.728
all of the points, and I'll
just focus on the vertices,

00:01:56.728 --> 00:01:58.817
because those are the
easiest ones to think about,

00:01:58.817 --> 00:02:00.443
to visualize.

00:02:00.443 --> 00:02:03.786
I can just rotate each of
those around the origin

00:02:03.786 --> 00:02:06.038
by positive 90 degrees.

00:02:06.038 --> 00:02:08.197
But how do we do that?

00:02:08.197 --> 00:02:11.146
And to do that, what I am going to do,

00:02:11.146 --> 00:02:12.447
to do that what I'm gonna do is

00:02:12.447 --> 00:02:15.674
I'm gonna draw a series
of right triangles.

00:02:15.674 --> 00:02:18.043
So let's first focus on,

00:02:18.043 --> 00:02:22.176
actually let's first focus
on point I right over here.

00:02:22.176 --> 00:02:24.149
And let me draw right triangle.

00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:26.146
And I could draw it several ways.

00:02:26.146 --> 00:02:28.341
But let me draw it like this.

00:02:29.183 --> 00:02:31.968
So, it's a right triangle

00:02:31.968 --> 00:02:34.337
where the line between the origin and I

00:02:34.337 --> 00:02:35.986
is its hypotenuse.

00:02:35.986 --> 00:02:38.098
So let me see if I can,

00:02:38.098 --> 00:02:40.189
It's I could probably draw,

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:42.487
actually I can use a line tool for that.

00:02:42.487 --> 00:02:44.026
So let me...

00:02:45.204 --> 00:02:48.048
So that's the hypotenuse of the line.

00:02:48.048 --> 00:02:51.693
Now if I'm gonna rotate I 90 degrees

00:02:51.693 --> 00:02:55.478
about the origin, that's
equivalent to rotating

00:02:55.478 --> 00:02:58.032
this right triangle 90 degrees.

00:02:58.032 --> 00:02:59.913
So what's going to happen there?

00:02:59.913 --> 00:03:02.351
Well this side, right over here,

00:03:02.351 --> 00:03:06.229
if I rotate this 90 degrees,

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:07.692
where is that going to go?

00:03:07.692 --> 00:03:09.874
Well instead of going
seven along the x-axis,

00:03:09.874 --> 00:03:11.638
it's going to go seven along the y-axis.

00:03:11.638 --> 00:03:15.331
So it's going to, if you
rotate it positive 90 degrees,

00:03:15.331 --> 00:03:18.789
that side it going to look like this.

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:21.786
So that's rotating it 90 degrees,

00:03:21.786 --> 00:03:22.923
just like that.

00:03:22.923 --> 00:03:25.454
Now what about this side over here?

00:03:25.454 --> 00:03:27.567
What about this side?

00:03:27.567 --> 00:03:29.796
Let me do this in a different color.

00:03:29.796 --> 00:03:31.329
What about,

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:34.997
what about this side right over here?

00:03:34.997 --> 00:03:36.530
Well this side over here, notice

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.294
we've gone down from the origin,

00:03:38.294 --> 00:03:40.222
we've gone down seven.

00:03:40.222 --> 00:03:42.311
But if you were to rotate it up,

00:03:42.311 --> 00:03:44.471
notice this forms a right angle

00:03:44.471 --> 00:03:45.980
between this magenta
side and this blue side,

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.395
so you're gonna form a right angle again.

00:03:48.395 --> 00:03:51.413
And so from this point,
you're gonna go straight

00:03:51.413 --> 00:03:54.756
as a right angle and
instead of going down seven,

00:03:54.756 --> 00:03:56.219
you're going to go to the right seven.

00:03:56.219 --> 00:03:59.401
So you're gonna go to the right seven,

00:03:59.401 --> 00:04:01.816
just like this.

00:04:01.816 --> 00:04:05.206
And so the point I, or
the corresponding point

00:04:05.206 --> 00:04:07.179
in the image after the rotation

00:04:07.179 --> 00:04:08.967
is going to be right over here.

00:04:08.967 --> 00:04:12.393
So that green line, let me
draw the hypotenuse now,

00:04:13.165 --> 00:04:16.508
it's gonna look like, oops,

00:04:16.508 --> 00:04:17.832
I wanted to do that in a different color.

00:04:17.832 --> 00:04:18.946
I want to do that in the green.

00:04:18.946 --> 00:04:20.595
I have trouble changing colors.

00:04:20.595 --> 00:04:22.592
Alright, so there you go.

00:04:22.592 --> 00:04:26.075
It's gonna look like that.

00:04:26.075 --> 00:04:27.143
So your new point I,

00:04:27.143 --> 00:04:31.276
if you rotate this triangle,
this right triangle 90 degrees,

00:04:31.276 --> 00:04:33.017
your new point I, maybe I shouldn't say,

00:04:33.017 --> 00:04:35.060
I'll call it I prime,

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.543
which is what is the image of this point

00:04:38.543 --> 00:04:40.214
after I've done the 90 degree rotation

00:04:40.214 --> 00:04:42.049
is going to be right over here.

00:04:42.049 --> 00:04:45.091
And now we can do that
for each of the points.

00:04:45.091 --> 00:04:47.622
We can do that for N here.

00:04:47.622 --> 00:04:49.456
Let's draw a right triangle.

00:04:49.456 --> 00:04:50.918
Let's draw a right triangle.

00:04:50.918 --> 00:04:53.125
And I can do it a bunch of different ways.

00:04:53.125 --> 00:04:56.561
I could draw a right triangle like this.

00:04:56.561 --> 00:04:57.444
Let me draw it like this.

00:04:57.444 --> 00:04:59.532
So that's one side of my right triangle.

00:04:59.532 --> 00:05:01.345
Actually, let me draw
the hypotenuse first.

00:05:01.345 --> 00:05:03.456
So I have the hypotenuse.

00:05:03.456 --> 00:05:07.168
Connects the origin to
my point, just like that.

00:05:07.168 --> 00:05:09.698
And then I could either draw it up here,

00:05:09.698 --> 00:05:11.406
or I could draw it down here,

00:05:12.549 --> 00:05:14.430
like this.

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:15.986
I could draw it like this.

00:05:15.986 --> 00:05:18.256
So if you rotated this 90 degrees,

00:05:18.256 --> 00:05:20.509
if you rotate this 90 degrees,

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:23.992
this side, which is seven units long

00:05:23.992 --> 00:05:26.616
and we're going seven below the origin,

00:05:26.616 --> 00:05:28.381
it's now going to be seven to the right.

00:05:28.381 --> 00:05:30.006
Right? If I rotate it by 90 degrees,

00:05:30.006 --> 00:05:32.397
it's going to be right over here.

00:05:32.397 --> 00:05:33.442
It's gonna be here

00:05:33.442 --> 00:05:36.924
and this side, which has length,

00:05:36.924 --> 00:05:38.899
let me switch colors.

00:05:38.899 --> 00:05:40.546
This side, which has length two,

00:05:40.546 --> 00:05:41.871
it forms a right angle,

00:05:41.871 --> 00:05:43.333
so we're gonna forma a right angle

00:05:43.333 --> 00:05:45.632
and have length two right over here.

00:05:45.632 --> 00:05:49.696
And so the image of
point N is going to be,

00:05:49.696 --> 00:05:52.389
let me get the right color.

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:56.196
It is going to be just like that.

00:05:56.196 --> 00:05:58.798
It is going to be the image of point N

00:05:58.798 --> 00:05:59.842
is going to be right here.

00:05:59.842 --> 00:06:01.329
I'll call that N prime.

00:06:01.329 --> 00:06:02.699
So we know where the new,

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:04.904
where the image of I
is, the image of N is,

00:06:04.904 --> 00:06:06.228
so now we just have to
think about where does

00:06:06.228 --> 00:06:07.714
the image of P sit?

00:06:07.714 --> 00:06:11.916
And once again, we can do our
little right triangle idea.

00:06:11.916 --> 00:06:13.811
So let's draw a right triangle.

00:06:14.721 --> 00:06:16.927
So, just like that.

00:06:16.927 --> 00:06:19.087
I could draw that side.

00:06:19.087 --> 00:06:21.376
And I can do this side, right over here.

00:06:22.355 --> 00:06:23.632
So if I were to rotate,

00:06:23.632 --> 00:06:25.096
if I were to focus on this,

00:06:25.096 --> 00:06:26.907
let me do this in a color I haven't.

00:06:26.907 --> 00:06:28.463
So if I were to focus on,

00:06:28.463 --> 00:06:29.949
I've already used that color.

00:06:29.949 --> 00:06:32.520
If I were to focus on
this, right over here,

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.633
and if I were to rotate it by 90 degrees.

00:06:34.633 --> 00:06:35.923
Instead of going two to the right,

00:06:35.923 --> 00:06:37.223
it's going to go two straight up.

00:06:37.223 --> 00:06:40.775
If I rotate this by 90 degrees
it's gonna be just like this.

00:06:40.775 --> 00:06:43.307
Now, this side on,

00:06:43.307 --> 00:06:45.337
let me pick another color.

00:06:46.388 --> 00:06:49.614
This side, right over
here, forms a right angle

00:06:49.614 --> 00:06:51.356
and it has a length of three.

00:06:51.356 --> 00:06:53.353
So we're gonna forma right angle here

00:06:53.353 --> 00:06:55.536
and have a length of three.

00:06:55.536 --> 00:06:56.790
And just like that, we know

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:58.740
where the image of P is going to be.

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:00.729
It is going to be,

00:07:00.729 --> 00:07:03.723
it is going to be right over here.

00:07:03.723 --> 00:07:04.978
So this is P prime.

00:07:04.978 --> 00:07:06.069
And I know it's kind of confusing,

00:07:06.069 --> 00:07:08.461
but now we just have to connect

00:07:08.461 --> 00:07:10.295
the P prime, the I prime, and the N prime

00:07:10.295 --> 00:07:13.057
to figure out what the
image of my triangle is

00:07:13.057 --> 00:07:13.934
after rotation.

00:07:13.934 --> 00:07:15.350
So let me do that.

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:17.552
So if I connect these two, I get that.

00:07:17.552 --> 00:07:21.034
If I connect these two, I get that.

00:07:21.034 --> 00:07:23.704
And if I connect these two,

00:07:23.704 --> 00:07:25.423
if I connect those two, I have that.

00:07:25.423 --> 00:07:26.886
And there you have it, I have the image.

00:07:26.886 --> 00:07:28.440
And now I just have to input it

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:30.856
on the actual problem.

00:07:30.856 --> 00:07:34.223
So, let's see, point
negative three comma two,

00:07:34.223 --> 00:07:36.057
let me get it out.

00:07:36.057 --> 00:07:39.076
So negative three comma two is there.

00:07:39.076 --> 00:07:41.723
I have seven comma two,

00:07:41.723 --> 00:07:43.681
so let me put that in there.

00:07:44.615 --> 00:07:46.457
Seven comma two.

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:51.169
And then I have seven
comma seven is there.

00:07:52.174 --> 00:07:54.101
So let me get this out.

00:07:54.101 --> 00:07:56.377
So seven comma seven.

00:07:56.377 --> 00:07:58.699
And then I'll draw here
again to connect the lines.

00:07:58.699 --> 00:07:59.720
And I'm done.

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:03.839
I've rotated it through
an angle of 90 degrees.

00:08:04.727 --> 00:08:06.676
Or negative 270 degrees, which is what

00:08:06.676 --> 00:08:09.440
they originally asked me for.

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:11.653
And I can check to make
sure I got the right answer.
