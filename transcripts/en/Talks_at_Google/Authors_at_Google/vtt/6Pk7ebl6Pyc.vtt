[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.106 --> 00:00:07.230
SPEAKER: Joining us today--

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:08.813
I don't think they
need introduction--

00:00:08.813 --> 00:00:10.530
but that the powerhouse
team behind State

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.560
Bird and The Progress, Stuart
Brioza and Nicole Krasinski.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:14.340
Welcome to Google.

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:14.799
NICOLE KRASINSKI: Thanks.

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:15.717
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:15.717 --> 00:00:16.758
STUART BRIOZA: All right.

00:00:16.758 --> 00:00:18.930
Thanks.

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:19.850
Awesome.

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.480
Well, it's nice to
be here, for sure.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.110
How many of you have
actually eaten at State Bird?

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.080
Oh, good-- like a
little less than half.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.650
Perfect.

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:32.570
We're always looking
for more customers.

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.278
SPEAKER: I think the
others just probably

00:00:34.278 --> 00:00:36.440
couldn't get a reservation,
more than anything.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.530
STUART BRIOZA: Yeah,
well, there's that, too.

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.110
And it's a long drive
from Sunnyvale if--

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.130
SPEAKER: Well worth
it-- not the problem.

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.490
STUART BRIOZA: Well, hopefully,
at the end of this demo,

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:53.390
you'll all be racing and coming
up with your own programs

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.240
to hack into our
reservation system

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.950
and get yourself a reservation.

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:59.570
SPEAKER: Challenge
accepted, Googlers.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:00.403
STUART BRIOZA: Yeah.

00:01:00.403 --> 00:01:02.210
I'm sure, in this group--

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.740
that's actually part of
the history of State Bird.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.490
For some of you, you
probably already know

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.170
this, because that stuff
is important to you.

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.870
But we were in Australia.

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.360
We were doing kind of
a pop-up in Australia.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.280
And I get a call at
3:00 in the morning

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.470
from Paolo Lucchesi, who's the
writer for the "San Francisco

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:25.472
Chronicle."

00:01:25.472 --> 00:01:26.930
And I'm like, wow,
he's calling me.

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:27.770
It's 3:00 in the morning.

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:28.490
Should I take it?

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.500
And I took it, and he starts
just grilling me about, like,

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.150
do you know that
you've been hacked

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.420
and that people are
making reservations?

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:39.457
And then it grew.

00:01:39.457 --> 00:01:40.540
It just continued to grow.

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.200
So Paolo calls me.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.590
And then the BBC calls us.

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.210
"The New York Times" calls us.

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.510
And I'm sort of like, this
isn't a big deal, people.

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.490
Like, I don't see
this as a big deal.

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.260
This is not a problem for us.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.740
Like, we're OK.

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.520
I was like, it
becomes a problem when

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.010
people hack into the
reservation system,

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:02.600
and then they don't show up.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.220
Because that's a problem to me.

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.580
But humans were coming in.

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.259
And they were saying
about robots and all this.

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.830
And I was like, I don't know
what you're talking about.

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.350
All I know is that we're
packed every night,

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:16.850
and that's a great thing.

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.009
And it was sort of like,
what responsibility do I

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.550
have in this?

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.150
And I was like, I have zero
responsibility in this.

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.100
SPEAKER: Stop being so popular?

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.770
STUART BRIOZA: Yeah, exactly.

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.960
But I think it spawned
off a whole new--

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:35.360
I call it the brave new world
of running a restaurant,

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.050
where it's like, OK, I never
thought about that issue.

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.260
I deal with, like,
dishwashers calling in sick,

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.060
food purveyors--

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.830
SPEAKER: We deal with that, too,
if it makes you feel better.

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:45.040
STUART BRIOZA: You do, too.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.540
Yeah.

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.000
OK-- real restaurant
issues-- you know,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.790
a sink that's runny or
backs up or something--

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.250
never about hacking into
a reservation system--

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.610
seems totally out of my league.

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.660
Anyway, today, we're
going to demo something

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.820
that I think has really turned
into very much a signature

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:12.997
dish at the restaurant, mainly
because it's so unusual.

00:03:12.997 --> 00:03:14.330
NICOLE KRASINSKI: And delicious.

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:15.870
STUART BRIOZA: And
very delicious.

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.286
SPEAKER: That goes
without saying,

00:03:17.286 --> 00:03:19.920
based on my personal
experiences in your restaurants.

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.200
STUART BRIOZA: The idea
of this is it's carrots.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:31.100
And we decided to
make a carrot dish.

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:32.990
I think every chef
in the country

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:37.350
is kind of challenged with
making a carrot dish--

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.380
something that becomes
kind of like part

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:44.960
of your roster of dishes.

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.870
It's just like everybody's got
kind of a great fried chicken

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.610
dish or a great steak dish.

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:52.160
You also, as a chef, have
to have a great carrot dish.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.420
At least it feels that way.

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.650
So our great carrot dish is to
do a kind of a carrot four-way,

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.344
right, where we make
a mochi out of this.

00:04:00.344 --> 00:04:01.760
And you've probably
all had mochi,

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.480
but you've never
had a savory mochi.

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:07.830
And it makes so much sense.

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:11.150
And I look at it as, this
mochi-- our carrot mochi--

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:16.409
is akin and a distant cousin
to the potato gnocchi in Italy.

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:17.450
So it's really like that.

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:19.550
It's that same idea.

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:25.310
The beauty of it is that
we're not using flour,

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:26.570
so there's no gluten in it.

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:31.640
But we are using a starchy,
glutenous rice flour

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.110
to bind it.

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.210
It's also got a huge
margin for error.

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:36.980
Where gnocchi are
so temperamental,

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:40.640
and you've got to have the right
starch content in your potato,

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:42.620
you've got to have
the right balance,

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.470
timing is such a critical,
these are virtually foolproof.

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:51.200
I mean, you can cook your
carrot puree the day before

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.530
and make your mochi the day of.

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:56.090
So there's not a lot of--

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:00.380
there's a big margin for
error, which is always nice,

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:03.620
I mean, I think, even
for home cooking.

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.470
And it's really
awesome with kids.

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:09.090
So if you have kids--

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:10.760
we have a kid.

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:14.142
Of course, he doesn't
eat anything like this.

00:05:14.142 --> 00:05:15.100
SPEAKER: Oh, the irony!

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.720
STUART BRIOZA: But
other people's kids

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.610
seem to really love this dish
when they come to restaurant.

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:22.990
As a matter of fact, we tend to,
when we go on to visit friends,

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:25.840
and we're staying with them,
their kids will be like,

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.430
can we make mochi?

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:28.540
I mean, they'll ask this.

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:29.581
And then I'll teach them.

00:05:29.581 --> 00:05:33.040
And we'll do a little
improv cooking class.

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:36.160
So let's kind of
get this started.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.950
I've taken the liberty of
getting my carrots cooked.

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:41.170
I'm just going to crank this up.

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:46.600
The idea is that I just cook
carrots in boiling water--

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:50.170
organic-- the sweetest
carrots you can find.

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:52.540
Just a little salt. So I'm
going to bring this up.

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:54.370
And they're really tender.

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:59.020
And how you gauge that is, do
they fall apart in your hands?

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:02.170
And I don't always encourage
people to put your hands

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:03.090
in boiling water.

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:05.770
But that's what happens
when you become a chef.

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:10.250
You become immune to these
ideas of boiling water.

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:12.610
So these are done now.

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:14.560
And I'm going to
take them and just

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.140
strain them out in a colander.

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.720
And I want to intensify
the carrot flavor.

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.040
So this is kind of the trick.

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.190
We could stop here.

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:27.640
And we could just kind
of puree these carrots.

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:32.530
Or we could do what I'm going
to do next, which is basically

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:38.930
intensify the carrot flavor by
putting this back on the stove.

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:41.590
Let's make sure these
induction burners are--

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:43.460
is it going?

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:44.090
I think it is.

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:47.120
I feel it.

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:49.340
Oh, yes.

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:52.700
I'm going to add carrot juice
to this-- so fresh carrot

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:54.905
juice added to these carrots.

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:01.900
And I'm going to kind of
do it little by little.

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:03.450
So I'm going to reduce it in.

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:06.630
And I'm going to concentrate
and basically sweeten up

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:07.200
the flavor.

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:13.410
The idea is just to get the most
carrot flavor into my mochi.

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:16.170
Otherwise, they will just
look like orange balls.

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:19.370
But if I can get more
and infuse more flavor,

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:22.140
it's really helpful.

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:25.500
While this is going, I'm going
to kind of roast the carrot.

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:27.690
So as I said, it's
a carrot four-way.

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:34.410
And so in a pan, with butter--

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:36.625
and don't be afraid
to use butter.

00:07:36.625 --> 00:07:39.570
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:41.950
Seriously, you laugh.

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:42.970
Don't be.

00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:46.464
This is why our
restaurant is so good.

00:07:46.464 --> 00:07:49.332
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:49.332 --> 00:07:51.600
But what I'm going to do
is, I'm going to just throw

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:53.090
my carrots right into here.

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:55.212
I may not use all of these.

00:07:55.212 --> 00:07:56.670
I try to find some
different sizes.

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:04.350
And I'm going to take a
couple of garlic cloves.

00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:07.140
And I like to keep
them in the skin.

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:09.935
And what I'll do is,
I just smash them.

00:08:09.935 --> 00:08:12.150
You can just kind
of take a knife.

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:14.940
And I just want
to crack the skin.

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:19.680
And I want to get just a
little flavor that comes out.

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:20.960
And I like to use the skin.

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:22.530
There's nothing
wrong with the skin.

00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:26.250
Don't be afraid of the skin.

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:30.690
And I'm going to
take some rosemary.

00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:34.409
And I'm just going to throw a
couple of sprigs of rosemary

00:08:34.409 --> 00:08:44.039
in here, a good crack of pepper.

00:08:44.039 --> 00:08:46.530
I, of course, like
to use a pepper mill.

00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:49.590
It just kind of makes sense.

00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:52.410
And then-- oops, pardon me--

00:08:52.410 --> 00:08:58.800
a good pinch of salt. And don't
be afraid to use salt either.

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:02.820
That's another secret to why
our restaurants are so good.

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:04.950
Now, you can smell that?

00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:07.700
Can you get that?

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:10.020
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:12.001
So soon enough, you'll get that.

00:09:12.001 --> 00:09:13.500
And I'm going to
turn the heat down,

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:15.420
because I don't want
to roast it too hot.

00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:17.220
But I do want the
butter to brown.

00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:19.230
And notice I didn't
brown my butter first.

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:20.090
You don't need to.

00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:23.310
You can actually brown it
in the process of doing it.

00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:26.930
And I'm just going to assume
that that's going to be good,

00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:30.150
and I'm going to
keep that going.

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:31.200
Pardon my reach here.

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:32.850
And notice that
Nicole just keeps

00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:39.430
adding more carrot juice to the
pot and we keep reducing it.

00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:41.820
And our goal here
is just to make

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:47.490
a real tight, concentrated
blob of a mass.

00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:49.800
"Blob" is a culinary
term for anything

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:52.053
that sort of moves
in "blobular" motion.

00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:01.246
So these take a while to cook.

00:10:01.246 --> 00:10:02.620
You could roast
them in the oven,

00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:05.080
or you can just do the
whole thing on stovetop.

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:07.260
And you see how it gets
foamy and buttery there?

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:08.900
Can you see all that?

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:11.970
That's the magic that's
happening to the carrots.

00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:14.140
And that's the browning of it.

00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:18.190
And so now I just want to manage
it and kind of keep it going.

00:10:18.190 --> 00:10:20.050
Cool.

00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:22.700
Feel free to ask questions
as we're going, too.

00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:25.700
I'm sort of not like, save
your questions to the end.

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:28.570
If something just inspires
you immediately, just like--

00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:29.794
ah-- jolt it out.

00:10:29.794 --> 00:10:31.210
SPEAKER: The only
dorky thing is I

00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:32.950
have to repeat them for
the people who watch it

00:10:32.950 --> 00:10:33.991
on the live stream later.

00:10:33.991 --> 00:10:35.130
So yes, Andre?

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:38.630
AUDIENCE: Do you ever
use the pressure cooker

00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:40.092
method [INAUDIBLE]?

00:10:40.092 --> 00:10:41.800
SPEAKER: Oh, do you
use a pressure cooker

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:44.090
method to caramelize?

00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:46.480
STUART BRIOZA: No, to
answer your question.

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:49.300
But that doesn't
sound like a bad idea.

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:51.990
For the carrot
puree to just-- or--

00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:54.309
AUDIENCE: Yeah, it brings
out a nuttier, more--

00:10:54.309 --> 00:10:55.600
STUART BRIOZA: How interesting.

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:57.350
NICOLE KRASINSKI: Or
for the brown butter.

00:10:57.350 --> 00:11:00.027
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:00.027 --> 00:11:01.360
STUART BRIOZA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:02.260
Yeah.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.360
I don't know.

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:06.690
I haven't, no.

00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:09.596
But not that I wouldn't
think that's a great idea.

00:11:09.596 --> 00:11:11.470
NICOLE KRASINSKI: We do
use a pressure cooker

00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:12.679
quite a lot for other things.

00:11:12.679 --> 00:11:13.844
STUART BRIOZA: That's right.

00:11:13.844 --> 00:11:14.370
Yeah.

00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:14.820
NICOLE KRASINSKI: Yeah.

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:16.778
STUART BRIOZA: Yeah, we
do use pressure cookers

00:11:16.778 --> 00:11:21.750
for kind of extractions,
more or less.

00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:25.160
I'll throw whole fish into
it-- like, whole cod-- and I'll

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:27.970
make fish stock in
a pressure cooker.

00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:31.150
And it's totally wild and crazy.

00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:34.010
But it really extracts all
the gelatins out of it.

00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:36.730
We'll do a French onion soup
in a pressure cooker, where

00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:39.220
we caramelize our
onions, and then we'll

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:43.510
put the onions into a pressure
cooker with onion stock.

00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:46.180
And then we'll turn it
on, and we'll let it go.

00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:49.840
And sometimes, I've put
gruyere in the pressure cooker

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:52.330
with the onions.

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:53.980
And it was pretty cool.

00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:55.630
I mean, it's some neat things.

00:11:55.630 --> 00:11:57.985
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:57.985 --> 00:11:59.200
STUART BRIOZA: Yeah.

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:01.000
I think that what
I like about it is

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.330
that you don't lose any liquid.

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:05.480
You retain everything.

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:07.146
So everything that
goes in is everything

00:12:07.146 --> 00:12:09.640
that's coming out, too.

00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:12.850
However, in this case, we want
to encourage the reduction

00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:16.180
because we're concentrating the
sugars and the sweet flavors

00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:16.840
in it.

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:18.900
But good question.

00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:20.260
Cool.

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.204
Those books are
just way too big.

00:12:22.204 --> 00:12:23.779
AUDIENCE: I made
it to [INAUDIBLE]..

00:12:23.779 --> 00:12:25.320
STUART BRIOZA: You
made it to-- yeah.

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:26.239
They're impressive.

00:12:26.239 --> 00:12:28.780
SPEAKER: It's a lifelong journey
through "Modernist Cuisine,"

00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:29.790
I think.

00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:31.540
They came out with
"Modernist Baking" now.

00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:34.081
I've tacked on many years to my
life to get through that one.

00:12:34.081 --> 00:12:36.640
STUART BRIOZA: All right.

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:44.545
So we're almost there on this--
making a totally great blob.

00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:51.950
And as it just gets
tightened up there,

00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:54.530
you can really smell the
concentration of carrots.

00:12:54.530 --> 00:13:02.530
And you're just getting
such a nice flavor there.

00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:05.980
Other mochis that
we've done as well--

00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:08.210
I think color plays
an important role.

00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:11.830
So we did a caramelized
onion and rosemary

00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:16.404
mochi that tasted great, but
it didn't look so beautiful.

00:13:16.404 --> 00:13:18.070
But there's other
things that we've done

00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:19.550
that have had great success.

00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:22.180
So like a pumpkin
or a squash mochi--

00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:24.310
winter squash, where
you roast, and you

00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:26.350
get that bright, vivid color.

00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:31.270
And then when you mix
in the mochi flour,

00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:33.460
it works the same way.

00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:36.250
And when you cook
them, they look just

00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:38.140
like the same
color of a pumpkin.

00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:43.330
So this recipe is totally
transferable to other things--

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:47.110
as many things as you
want to kind of try.

00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:54.610
I would totally encourage you to
make the carrot version first.

00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:58.780
So what I'm going to do
is, I want to take this--

00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:01.100
and you can see how
it's really tight--

00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:02.779
SPEAKER: "Blobular,"
if you will.

00:14:02.779 --> 00:14:04.195
STUART BRIOZA:
Glob, with texture.

00:14:07.545 --> 00:14:08.380
Let's see here.

00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:08.620
NICOLE KRASINSKI: Are
you done with that guy?

00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:10.370
STUART BRIOZA: I think
I'm done with this.

00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:19.060
I'm just going to puree it.

00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:24.600
I like the texture
of carrot in there.

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:28.700
So it's not imperative
that it's very smooth.

00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:30.660
But it's OK if it's very smooth.

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:36.660
I kind of think like the
texture of rice, maybe--

00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:38.760
the coarseness of broken rice--

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:40.560
is a good way to think about it.

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:46.490
Cool.

00:14:46.490 --> 00:14:48.740
And now what I'm going to do--

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:51.080
one of the most
important steps here

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:55.790
is, I am going to weigh it out.

00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:06.540
There is a recipe,
and it tells you

00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:08.370
how much to use, of
course, because that's

00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:10.090
what recipe books do.

00:15:10.090 --> 00:15:13.580
But basically, we like
to work in ratios.

00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:16.250
And so I've got this
nice carrot puree.

00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:19.830
And I'm getting 500.

00:15:19.830 --> 00:15:24.810
And I know I brought a
pound of mochi flour.

00:15:24.810 --> 00:15:28.195
So I start with
one-to-one ratio.

00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:35.300
I usually end up adding
a little bit more.

00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:38.980
So there's 454 grams.

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:42.060
I'll just go 400 to
give myself a little--

00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:48.030
and again, it's whatever
you want to make.

00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:51.450
I mean, we make this
in 2,500-gram batches,

00:15:51.450 --> 00:15:53.401
is kind of the idea.

00:15:53.401 --> 00:15:54.900
And then what I'll
do is, since I've

00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:57.510
got about 400 grams right here.

00:15:57.510 --> 00:16:03.295
And I'll add another 400
grams or so of mochi flour.

00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:09.880
And that will be
my starting point.

00:16:18.090 --> 00:16:20.840
Perfect.

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:25.890
And being that I'm
adding a lot of flour,

00:16:25.890 --> 00:16:30.106
I'm going to add just a nice
pinch of salt into there.

00:16:30.106 --> 00:16:34.070
AUDIENCE: 2,500
would be [INAUDIBLE]??

00:16:34.070 --> 00:16:37.040
STUART BRIOZA: [LAUGHS] Yeah.

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:41.865
Boy, 2,500-- so that's about
five pounds of mochi, right?

00:16:41.865 --> 00:16:44.740
But we're making
two pounds of mochi.

00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:47.690
It would last is about a
night's worth of service.

00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:50.530
This is one of our most
popular dishes, for sure,

00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:52.750
outside of the quail, of course.

00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:55.104
But people just love this dish.

00:16:55.104 --> 00:16:56.770
It's a hard one for
us to take off, now,

00:16:56.770 --> 00:16:58.480
because it's so unusual.

00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:02.560
And it's just a
slam dunk everyday.

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:04.369
People eat it, and
nobody's like, oh,

00:17:04.369 --> 00:17:05.920
whoa, that's a weird texture.

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:07.450
They're eating it
and going, wow,

00:17:07.450 --> 00:17:10.099
I never thought carrots
could actually taste so good.

00:17:10.099 --> 00:17:11.530
And this is really unusual.

00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:15.369
And it's that
thing that's like--

00:17:15.369 --> 00:17:20.630
it's familiar, but
it's different.

00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:25.000
And that's one of the
philosophies of State Bird,

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.609
is that we try to work
within the familiar,

00:17:27.609 --> 00:17:31.690
but we want to do something
that's just a little different.

00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:35.150
We do a fried quail in lieu
of doing fried chicken.

00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:39.490
But the idea was inspired
from fried chicken, of course.

00:17:39.490 --> 00:17:42.580
We make mochi
instead of gnocchi.

00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:43.157
We do--

00:17:43.157 --> 00:17:44.740
NICOLE KRASINSKI:
Ice cream sandwiches

00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:45.790
that aren't ice cream.

00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:47.248
STUART BRIOZA: Ice
cream sandwiches

00:17:47.248 --> 00:17:49.060
that aren't ice cream--

00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:49.690
but they are.

00:17:49.690 --> 00:17:50.660
But they're not.

00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:51.490
But they are.

00:17:51.490 --> 00:17:52.390
But they're not.

00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:54.280
That's an argument that
we continue to have.

00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:03.970
This is one of my favorite
dishes, and it's in the book.

00:18:03.970 --> 00:18:05.820
We do an amatriciana.

00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:07.540
Do you guys know amatriciana?

00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:08.040
Anyone?

00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:09.081
You're nodding your head.

00:18:09.081 --> 00:18:10.630
I'm going to put
you on the spot.

00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:12.166
What is it?

00:18:12.166 --> 00:18:15.147
AUDIENCE: Tomato, sometimes
onion, and guanciale.

00:18:15.147 --> 00:18:16.230
STUART BRIOZA: You got it.

00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:16.730
Yeah.

00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:17.870
So it's a Roman dish.

00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:20.950
It's a Roman pasta dish
that's made with guanciale,

00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:24.670
which is cured pork jowl.

00:18:24.670 --> 00:18:26.320
And so it's got a
lot of pepper to it.

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:27.310
And it's like pancetta.

00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:30.550
But it's using this
portion of the pork.

00:18:30.550 --> 00:18:31.890
It is magic.

00:18:31.890 --> 00:18:34.090
And it's one of my
all-time favorite dishes

00:18:34.090 --> 00:18:36.780
ever to be made in the world.

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:40.060
And it's really kind
of a nice tomato sauce.

00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:42.970
You start off rendering
out your guanciale.

00:18:42.970 --> 00:18:45.220
You add your tomato sauce
and you add rigatoni

00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:48.730
and you had lots of
pecorino and black pepper.

00:18:48.730 --> 00:18:50.680
And that's the dish.

00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:54.760
Well, we riff off of that.

00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:56.230
And we take guanciale.

00:18:56.230 --> 00:18:57.210
We render it out.

00:18:57.210 --> 00:18:59.710
And we add a little
garlic and some chilies.

00:18:59.710 --> 00:19:01.360
We add a little
chanterelle to it.

00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:05.750
We add fresh tomato sauce
from fresh heirloom tomatoes.

00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:08.560
So this is something we
only do in the summer.

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:10.330
And then we use tofu skin--

00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:12.790
yuba-- as our noodles for this.

00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:14.890
So we totally spin
it on its ear.

00:19:14.890 --> 00:19:22.120
Because I think anyone's Italian
grandmother would beat me

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:24.800
to a pulp with a wooden
spoon in the kitchen

00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:26.800
if they knew that I was using--

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:33.400
I mean, first if I was using
fresh tomatoes in amatriciana,

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:35.920
in something beyond
just rigatoni.

00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:37.870
But the fact that
it's tofu skin--

00:19:37.870 --> 00:19:38.740
but it's magic.

00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:42.550
And when you eat the dish,
it tastes like amatriciana.

00:19:42.550 --> 00:19:46.780
But it's familiar,
but different.

00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:49.480
And so that is what we do.

00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:52.410
So what I'm looking
for here in my dough

00:19:52.410 --> 00:19:55.490
is just something
about this consistency.

00:19:55.490 --> 00:19:57.100
It's a little tight.

00:19:57.100 --> 00:19:58.960
It's also a little tacky to it.

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:03.520
But it can hold its shape,
not unlike Play-Doh.

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:05.650
But there is a nice
tackiness to it.

00:20:05.650 --> 00:20:09.910
And so for this, what we
would do is, we'd make balls.

00:20:09.910 --> 00:20:14.800
And so I'm going to have
Nicole make some little mochi

00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:15.430
balls there.

00:20:19.321 --> 00:20:21.070
I'm going to really
put myself to the test

00:20:21.070 --> 00:20:23.900
because I generally always
have a pot of water going,

00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:25.840
and I do my little tester.

00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:29.910
But I'm so confident today that
I don't need to do a tester.

00:20:29.910 --> 00:20:31.343
SPEAKER: Living dangerously.

00:20:31.343 --> 00:20:32.160
I like it.

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:32.500
STUART BRIOZA: Yeah.

00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:33.833
That's something in the kitchen.

00:20:33.833 --> 00:20:36.040
It's like, if we make
a sausage or a dough

00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:38.830
or anything of that sort,
we always make a tester.

00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:41.230
We just want to make sure
that the seasoning's right,

00:20:41.230 --> 00:20:43.720
that the texture is right.

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:45.880
And so if any adjustments
need to be made,

00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:48.670
it's not after you've
portioned 150 balls

00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:51.280
and you have to put them
back in and remake it.

00:20:54.250 --> 00:20:56.260
So while that's going,
I'm going to turn

00:20:56.260 --> 00:21:00.220
the heat back on on this.

00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:02.710
And you see our carrots are
just kind of moving away.

00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:04.410
And they're gorgeous.

00:21:04.410 --> 00:21:05.890
They're not quite there yet.

00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:07.730
So we'll just let
them kind of finish.

00:21:07.730 --> 00:21:10.210
I'm gonna turn that heat up.

00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:13.240
The next step in
our process here--

00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:13.990
oh, you know what?

00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:19.390
I used my bowl here.

00:21:22.330 --> 00:21:24.050
Let me see if I can do this.

00:21:27.677 --> 00:21:29.760
SPEAKER: I'm certain we
have another bowl for you.

00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:30.390
STUART BRIOZA: Are you sure?

00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:31.634
I'm OK with repurposing.

00:21:31.634 --> 00:21:33.550
SPEAKER: Positive-- it's
literally right here!

00:21:33.550 --> 00:21:33.780
STUART BRIOZA: OK.

00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:34.863
SPEAKER: Thank you, Jared.

00:21:34.863 --> 00:21:36.000
STUART BRIOZA: Thank you.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:41.520
So this is the third component.

00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:43.330
It's going to be
our vinaigrette.

00:21:43.330 --> 00:21:46.650
And so because we've
got roasted carrots,

00:21:46.650 --> 00:21:49.500
we've got pickled carrots, which
I'll go into in just a minute,

00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:51.330
and then we've got
the carrot mochi,

00:21:51.330 --> 00:21:54.270
we want to reintroduce another
fresh component into it.

00:21:54.270 --> 00:21:58.260
So this is just
fresh carrot juice

00:21:58.260 --> 00:22:02.016
that becomes the basis of
our carrot vinaigrette.

00:22:02.016 --> 00:22:03.390
And to that, what
I'm going to do

00:22:03.390 --> 00:22:05.010
is I'm going to add fresh lime.

00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:12.290
I like to kind of massage
my lime up a little bit.

00:22:12.290 --> 00:22:17.130
And I'm just going to
squeeze lime juice into this.

00:22:17.130 --> 00:22:20.700
I'm going purely by
taste here, you guys.

00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:23.550
I feel pretty confident that
I've got that part nailed.

00:22:26.250 --> 00:22:32.900
And I'm just going
to juice a lime.

00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:36.400
Next, the microplane
comes in handy.

00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:38.890
And this is going
to blow your minds.

00:22:38.890 --> 00:22:47.430
So I think that microplanes
are about the best tool ever

00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:49.930
to be created in the kitchen.

00:22:49.930 --> 00:22:51.010
And I'll show you why--

00:22:55.170 --> 00:22:58.450
because it can replace
everything you own.

00:22:58.450 --> 00:22:58.950
All right.

00:22:58.950 --> 00:23:02.960
So I use a microplane
to grate ginger.

00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:05.190
And I feel that
what I get out of it

00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:10.630
is I get a great disbursement
of ginger flavor.

00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:13.170
And you can see it
underneath there.

00:23:13.170 --> 00:23:18.770
And it really takes it
down to such a ground mass

00:23:18.770 --> 00:23:20.230
that it works great.

00:23:20.230 --> 00:23:23.230
I use a microplane
to grate garlic.

00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:24.900
And I'll take a clove of garlic.

00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:26.355
And I don't use a lot.

00:23:26.355 --> 00:23:29.210
A little garlic goes a long way.

00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:30.982
You can always add more.

00:23:30.982 --> 00:23:32.190
This is the mindblowing part.

00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:34.770
I use a microplane to
grate fresh chilies.

00:23:38.545 --> 00:23:42.560
It comes with a nice sound,
too, like you're actually

00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:44.330
grating something.

00:23:44.330 --> 00:23:46.760
And you never know how
spicy your chilies are.

00:23:50.197 --> 00:23:53.150
Woo!

00:23:53.150 --> 00:23:55.830
So I'll add a little bit
of ground chili into it.

00:23:58.510 --> 00:24:00.290
The chili thing
really blows my mind.

00:24:00.290 --> 00:24:01.040
I love doing this.

00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:02.140
SPEAKER: I've never
seen that before.

00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:02.973
STUART BRIOZA: Yeah.

00:24:02.973 --> 00:24:03.812
See?

00:24:03.812 --> 00:24:04.770
SPEAKER: Stealing that.

00:24:04.770 --> 00:24:06.243
STUART BRIOZA: And then what
we're going to do is we're

00:24:06.243 --> 00:24:08.475
going to add just a
little fresh black pepper,

00:24:08.475 --> 00:24:10.950
a pinch of salt to this.

00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:13.890
And then we're going
to kind of make

00:24:13.890 --> 00:24:17.610
an oil slick of extra
virgin olive oil.

00:24:17.610 --> 00:24:21.300
Stir this whole thing around.

00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:24.480
And now we've got this super
vibrant carrot vinaigrette.

00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:31.020
We taste everything.

00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:32.490
I think it needs more acid.

00:24:32.490 --> 00:24:34.290
The garlic is amazing.

00:24:34.290 --> 00:24:36.070
The ginger comes through.

00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:37.775
I'm getting a little heat.

00:24:37.775 --> 00:24:39.900
I think I kind of want a
little more heat in there.

00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:44.400
But this is how we do it.

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:50.630
You constantly are
tasting for what you want.

00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:52.680
I'm going to put a little
more ginger in there.

00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:57.180
Ginger and carrot is just one
of the magical combinations,

00:24:57.180 --> 00:25:00.315
as you probably know already.

00:25:00.315 --> 00:25:06.510
A little more ginger, a
little more jalapeno--

00:25:06.510 --> 00:25:10.440
what I love about the
jalapeno by doing this,

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:13.971
is that you really
don't get the seeds.

00:25:13.971 --> 00:25:14.845
Let's go fresh spoon.

00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:22.460
There it is.

00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:26.060
So what I'm looking
for there is,

00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:29.907
I want to taste
the carrot juice.

00:25:29.907 --> 00:25:32.490
But I want to taste all of the
other ingredients-- the garlic,

00:25:32.490 --> 00:25:34.350
the ginger, the jalapeno.

00:25:34.350 --> 00:25:36.980
I want to have a nice little
kind of slick of olive oil

00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:40.220
that adds the fat to it.

00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:42.470
And I also want to just
make sure that the lime--

00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:45.400
the acid and salt
is really balanced.

00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:47.360
Not one should
overpower the other.

00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:48.900
And that's how we do that.

00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:49.400
Cool.

00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:52.710
So these carrots are
just doing really well.

00:25:52.710 --> 00:25:55.520
And I'm running out
of stove space here.

00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:59.950
But we're going to just
take it really quick.

00:25:59.950 --> 00:26:02.940
So the last part of this dish--

00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:06.650
now we've got our
carrot juice vin.

00:26:06.650 --> 00:26:09.890
We're going to make the duqqa.

00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:16.040
And duqqa is just kind of
a cumin-based spice blend

00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:17.860
that we can use in
the mortar and pestle.

00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:19.520
And we do a pistachio duqqa.

00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:22.260
We want that nuttiness
from the pistachios.

00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:24.610
So here, I am going
to let these guys--

00:26:24.610 --> 00:26:26.810
what I'm going to do is
turn it up really well.

00:26:30.510 --> 00:26:32.650
This is so good.

00:26:32.650 --> 00:26:34.390
I love carrots when
they're just slow

00:26:34.390 --> 00:26:35.530
cooked in butter like this.

00:26:35.530 --> 00:26:36.571
You see what's happening?

00:26:36.571 --> 00:26:39.444
I mean, just like magic
over time is just happening.

00:26:39.444 --> 00:26:41.360
AUDIENCE: Is that camera
pointed at the stove?

00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:42.670
STUART BRIOZA: I don't know.

00:26:42.670 --> 00:26:44.561
Can we see?

00:26:44.561 --> 00:26:45.060
No?

00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:46.600
OK.

00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:49.330
NICOLE KRASINSKI: You have to
hold it over the cutting board.

00:26:49.330 --> 00:26:51.640
STUART BRIOZA: Oh, the
camera is not there?

00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:52.420
NICOLE KRASINSKI:
It's right there.

00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:53.378
SPEAKER: It's this one.

00:26:53.378 --> 00:26:54.175
It's that one.

00:26:54.175 --> 00:26:55.780
NICOLE KRASINSKI: So it's
right over where you're-- yeah,

00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:56.635
right there.

00:26:56.635 --> 00:26:58.480
No, down, down, down,
down, down, down.

00:26:58.480 --> 00:26:58.884
SPEAKER: Down a little bit.

00:26:58.884 --> 00:26:59.288
Down a little bit.

00:26:59.288 --> 00:26:59.692
Down a little bit.

00:26:59.692 --> 00:27:00.500
Ta-da!

00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:01.791
STUART BRIOZA: Oh, there it is.

00:27:01.791 --> 00:27:02.341
Oh, I see it.

00:27:02.341 --> 00:27:02.840
OK.

00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:03.756
Can you guys see that?

00:27:03.756 --> 00:27:04.840
Yeah, that's gorgeous.

00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:05.770
Wonderful.

00:27:05.770 --> 00:27:10.692
[LAUGHS] Well, now that we
got that part out of the way--

00:27:10.692 --> 00:27:12.150
SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE]
is well aware.

00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:15.870
STUART BRIOZA: Cool.

00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:16.370
All right.

00:27:19.645 --> 00:27:21.270
I'm going to pull
that off, and they're

00:27:21.270 --> 00:27:22.902
going to just continue
to simmer there.

00:27:22.902 --> 00:27:24.360
Meanwhile, what
I'm going to do is,

00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:25.920
I'm going add everything here--

00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:30.250
whole coriander seeds, cumin.

00:27:30.250 --> 00:27:34.860
I'm going to add
sesame to this mix.

00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:37.530
I've already pre-toasted
my pistachios.

00:27:37.530 --> 00:27:39.850
I've got chili flakes
and I've got sea salt.

00:27:39.850 --> 00:27:42.120
I do not want to
toast my chili flakes.

00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:45.560
If I did, all of you out
there would start sneezing

00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:46.830
and have eye irritation.

00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:54.210
But I'll work over a nice
high heat and bring this up.

00:27:54.210 --> 00:27:57.207
And as soon as I can kind
of see little wisps of smoke

00:27:57.207 --> 00:27:58.290
is where I know it's done.

00:27:58.290 --> 00:28:00.748
And I'm going to place it right
into the mortar and pestle.

00:28:06.450 --> 00:28:09.060
SPEAKER: What other dishes do
you find you cannot take off

00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:10.080
your menu?

00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:11.760
STUART BRIOZA: Oh,
well, let's see here.

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:13.300
SPEAKER: Aside from the
State Bird, of course.

00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:14.720
NICOLE KRASINSKI: Pork belly.

00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:16.215
SPEAKER: Yeah, that pork belly.

00:28:16.215 --> 00:28:18.340
NICOLE KRASINSKI: Probably
pork belly with citrus--

00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:19.574
fish sauce vin.

00:28:19.574 --> 00:28:20.115
SPEAKER: Yes.

00:28:20.115 --> 00:28:20.970
STUART BRIOZA: Yep.

00:28:20.970 --> 00:28:23.550
NICOLE KRASINSKI: Some
people have it for dessert.

00:28:23.550 --> 00:28:25.290
SPEAKER: Next time.

00:28:25.290 --> 00:28:26.420
STUART BRIOZA: Next time.

00:28:26.420 --> 00:28:27.960
The garlic bread with burrata.

00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:30.060
SPEAKER: Ooh, that one
was transformative.

00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:30.120
STUART BRIOZA: Yeah, see?

00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:31.400
You guys just did it.

00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:34.110
That's why we can't take
it off, right there.

00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:35.240
We've got that dialed out.

00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:38.340
We sell about 70
of those a night.

00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:42.960
And we serve about
200 people a night.

00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:45.272
SPEAKER: That's one that
comes by too late in the meal.

00:28:45.272 --> 00:28:46.730
And you're like,
but I ate so much,

00:28:46.730 --> 00:28:48.926
but I have to eat
the garlic bread.

00:28:48.926 --> 00:28:50.760
AUDIENCE: Where do
you get the burrata?

00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:52.301
STUART BRIOZA: So
the burrata that we

00:28:52.301 --> 00:28:56.790
use is from one of the original
burrata makers in the US.

00:28:56.790 --> 00:28:58.560
And they're down in LA.

00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:01.430
Gioia is the name.

00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:02.180
I asked him once--

00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:03.638
I was like, so
what's your process?

00:29:03.638 --> 00:29:05.830
And he was like, seriously?

00:29:05.830 --> 00:29:07.380
It's the one thing
I make and I'm

00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:10.307
going to give you my secrets?

00:29:10.307 --> 00:29:12.015
SPEAKER: Hey, you've
got a question here?

00:29:12.015 --> 00:29:13.500
AUDIENCE: What are
some dishes you wish

00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:14.490
you could get off the menu?

00:29:14.490 --> 00:29:15.420
SPEAKER: Oh, what
are some dishes

00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:17.070
you wish you could that you--

00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:18.180
do you constrain yourself?

00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:19.320
The sky's the limit?

00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:21.016
STUART BRIOZA: Not at all.

00:29:21.016 --> 00:29:23.390
NICOLE KRASINSKI: That's why
we have a second restaurant.

00:29:23.390 --> 00:29:25.020
STUART BRIOZA: Yeah.

00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:26.730
There you go.

00:29:26.730 --> 00:29:29.190
There aren't really any
dishes that we wish we could.

00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:33.510
Because State Bird is based
around and it's built around

00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:37.230
cook-what-you-want, and
the freedom of cooking.

00:29:37.230 --> 00:29:39.450
The one thing that I
always say about our food

00:29:39.450 --> 00:29:41.400
there is it has to be shareable.

00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:45.330
So I wouldn't put, like, a
steak on a plate and serve it.

00:29:45.330 --> 00:29:51.780
It's shareable, but
we keep people moving.

00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:54.550
We keep the evening--

00:29:54.550 --> 00:29:56.250
the dinner service-- moving.

00:29:56.250 --> 00:29:59.700
And we want to make sure
that it is as user-friendly

00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:01.050
as possible--

00:30:01.050 --> 00:30:02.610
all of our food.

00:30:02.610 --> 00:30:04.800
And we think about that.

00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:08.050
How can I get more food on your
table, is what I think about.

00:30:08.050 --> 00:30:11.970
And you think about, how can
I get more food in my stomach?

00:30:11.970 --> 00:30:15.980
So it's a team effort.

00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:18.150
And it's symbiotic.

00:30:18.150 --> 00:30:20.640
So do you see these
little wisps of smoke.

00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:21.930
You can see that as I'm--

00:30:24.289 --> 00:30:25.580
NICOLE KRASINSKI: There you go.

00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:26.080
SPEAKER: Hey!

00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:27.330
STUART BRIOZA: Yeah, I got it.

00:30:27.330 --> 00:30:29.850
We got it.

00:30:29.850 --> 00:30:32.940
And what I'm doing is, I'm just
bringing those flavors out.

00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:35.160
Now, some of you can smell that.

00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:38.090
Just wait.

00:30:38.090 --> 00:30:41.068
Let's put that back on.

00:30:41.068 --> 00:30:44.090
I'm gonna add some
sea salt to this--

00:30:44.090 --> 00:30:45.866
a nice pinch.

00:30:45.866 --> 00:30:47.490
I'm gonna add my
chili flakes because I

00:30:47.490 --> 00:30:51.950
do kind of want them to have
a little intensity, though.

00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:57.790
I'm going to add some
pistachios to this mix.

00:30:57.790 --> 00:31:01.892
And now, I hope this works.

00:31:01.892 --> 00:31:03.600
SPEAKER: Will you guys
share a little bit

00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:06.099
about the inspiration for the
restaurant in the first place?

00:31:06.099 --> 00:31:08.420
It's so unique.

00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:09.920
NICOLE KRASINSKI:
It's a long story.

00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:11.253
SPEAKER: It's a beautiful story.

00:31:11.253 --> 00:31:12.000
It's in the book.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:12.600
NICOLE KRASINSKI: It is.

00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:13.882
SPEAKER: But short version?

00:31:13.882 --> 00:31:14.840
NICOLE KRASINSKI: Sure.

00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:16.340
SPEAKER: Inspiration, drivers?

00:31:16.340 --> 00:31:16.530
NICOLE KRASINSKI: Yeah.

00:31:16.530 --> 00:31:18.390
We never intended
to open State Bird.

00:31:18.390 --> 00:31:20.730
So we had written
a business plan.

00:31:20.730 --> 00:31:23.130
We had raised money for
what is now The Progress,

00:31:23.130 --> 00:31:26.740
and had found a space,
were ready to go,

00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:28.560
and the space fell through.

00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:31.040
So we were like, well, shit.

00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:33.100
And we found out, also,
we were having a baby.

00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:33.760
SPEAKER: Ta-da!

00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:35.218
NICOLE KRASINSKI:
So we really felt

00:31:35.218 --> 00:31:37.890
like we needed to
get jobs quickly.

00:31:37.890 --> 00:31:41.120
So we had been focusing on one
neighborhood in San Francisco.

00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:43.510
And we told our broker,
just look everywhere.

00:31:43.510 --> 00:31:46.260
Look in all the places we
never wanted to look before.

00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:48.930
And a week after our son was
born, she was like, well,

00:31:48.930 --> 00:31:52.050
I have this place on Fillmore,
which I know you don't like.

00:31:52.050 --> 00:31:54.535
But I think you
should go look at it.

00:31:54.535 --> 00:31:56.340
SPEAKER: Across from
the Panda Express.

00:31:56.340 --> 00:31:58.965
NICOLE KRASINSKI: That's right--
across from the Panda Express,

00:31:58.965 --> 00:32:00.410
in the Safeway parking lot.

00:32:00.410 --> 00:32:01.576
STUART BRIOZA: And a Subway.

00:32:01.576 --> 00:32:03.259
SPEAKER: Western
Addition, y'all.

00:32:03.259 --> 00:32:05.550
NICOLE KRASINSKI: Stuart rode
his bike down there and--

00:32:05.550 --> 00:32:07.466
STUART BRIOZA: Can you
smell this, by the way?

00:32:07.466 --> 00:32:11.130
NICOLE KRASINSKI: --walked
into this dark purple, grease

00:32:11.130 --> 00:32:16.049
trap-smelling, not very
beautiful, tiny space.

00:32:16.049 --> 00:32:17.340
The whole building was vacant--

00:32:17.340 --> 00:32:18.514
10,000 square feet.

00:32:18.514 --> 00:32:20.430
And then the landlord
took him into this space

00:32:20.430 --> 00:32:22.550
that's now The Progress
with the huge arching

00:32:22.550 --> 00:32:26.280
ceilings from the old movie
theater that was built in 1911.

00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:28.360
And we were like, this
is where we want to be.

00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:30.390
You could be
anywhere in the city.

00:32:30.390 --> 00:32:32.700
You don't see anything
outside those windows.

00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:34.020
But you have skylights.

00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:37.690
And it was the
restaurant we wanted.

00:32:37.690 --> 00:32:39.750
But it would cost a lot
and take a lot of time

00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:41.959
because it had never
been a restaurant.

00:32:41.959 --> 00:32:43.750
STUART BRIOZA: And we
needed to make money.

00:32:43.750 --> 00:32:45.550
NICOLE KRASINSKI: And
we needed to make money.

00:32:45.550 --> 00:32:46.883
STUART BRIOZA: We had a kid now.

00:32:46.883 --> 00:32:50.270
And we were running out of time.

00:32:50.270 --> 00:32:51.510
NICOLE KRASINSKI: Yeah.

00:32:51.510 --> 00:32:53.800
So we went back that night
and said to each other,

00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:55.230
what if we take both spaces?

00:32:55.230 --> 00:32:57.780
And the landlord was
thinking the same thing

00:32:57.780 --> 00:32:58.532
at that same time.

00:32:58.532 --> 00:33:00.240
So we signed two leases
at once, but then

00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:01.656
had to come up
with a new business

00:33:01.656 --> 00:33:03.400
plan and a whole new concept.

00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:07.510
So in a few weeks, we sort
of visualized State Bird,

00:33:07.510 --> 00:33:10.050
thinking that it would be just
a really fast thing to open,

00:33:10.050 --> 00:33:12.133
and then we could move on
to the dream restaurant.

00:33:12.133 --> 00:33:14.290
And then things
unraveled differently.

00:33:14.290 --> 00:33:16.850
AUDIENCE: Funny how
that works, isn't it?

00:33:16.850 --> 00:33:20.016
STUART BRIOZA: Yeah, so State
Bird, we literally winged it.

00:33:20.016 --> 00:33:23.117
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:23.117 --> 00:33:24.450
SPEAKER: That's my kind of joke.

00:33:24.450 --> 00:33:25.810
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
dim-sum-- American dim sum?

00:33:25.810 --> 00:33:27.643
SPEAKER: Yeah, why
American dim sum, which--

00:33:27.643 --> 00:33:29.450
PS-- is the best idea ever.

00:33:29.450 --> 00:33:30.360
STUART BRIOZA: Yeah.

00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:33.922
In the early days, people
would say, god, why

00:33:33.922 --> 00:33:34.880
didn't I think of this?

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:35.350
You know, it was one of those.

00:33:35.350 --> 00:33:36.910
SPEAKER: And nobody has
really ripped it off,

00:33:36.910 --> 00:33:37.670
which is surprising.

00:33:37.670 --> 00:33:39.003
NICOLE KRASINSKI: It's not easy.

00:33:39.003 --> 00:33:40.100
People have tried.

00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:42.480
STUART BRIOZA: There's been
a little bit of some people

00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:47.210
who've adopted certain ways.

00:33:47.210 --> 00:33:48.710
And I think that
that's kind of more

00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:52.260
the interesting idea
rather than ripping it off.

00:33:52.260 --> 00:33:54.270
It's actually a lot
harder than people think.

00:33:54.270 --> 00:33:56.740
And those who have
tried to rip it off

00:33:56.740 --> 00:33:58.295
have had a very tough go of it.

00:33:58.295 --> 00:33:59.670
SPEAKER: Well,
serves them right.

00:33:59.670 --> 00:34:00.878
STUART BRIOZA: And that's OK.

00:34:00.878 --> 00:34:05.640
I mean, I think that it's OK to
have multiple of restaurants.

00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:08.820
But it's also really
nice and reassuring.

00:34:08.820 --> 00:34:13.590
What we do works because
we've really made it work.

00:34:13.590 --> 00:34:16.739
And the idea of it came about--

00:34:16.739 --> 00:34:19.830
during the time that we were
looking to open a restaurant,

00:34:19.830 --> 00:34:23.550
we did a lot of
private catering gigs.

00:34:23.550 --> 00:34:27.159
And they were really
by word of mouth.

00:34:27.159 --> 00:34:29.969
We were caterers out of
our little 900-square-foot

00:34:29.969 --> 00:34:32.010
apartment in San Francisco.

00:34:32.010 --> 00:34:37.530
And we started to get a lot of
requests for people who wanted

00:34:37.530 --> 00:34:39.300
to have an informal
dinner party,

00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:41.580
but still liked really
creative food and lots of fun,

00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:45.389
and nobody wants to sit down--
so just like a cocktail party--

00:34:45.389 --> 00:34:48.060
and kitchens--
nice home kitchens

00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:51.330
that had a nice little island.

00:34:51.330 --> 00:34:53.820
And it would be kind
of a walk-around event.

00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:56.070
And so rather than just doing
an hors d'oeuvres party,

00:34:56.070 --> 00:35:01.590
these became like 11,
12, to 15-item hors

00:35:01.590 --> 00:35:02.760
d'oeuvres parties--

00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:04.740
so almost like a
coursed-out dinner.

00:35:04.740 --> 00:35:07.890
And one of the events, we
even hired a friend who

00:35:07.890 --> 00:35:10.020
was a sommelier at Gary Danko.

00:35:10.020 --> 00:35:11.670
And he went around,
and he'd just

00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:13.900
be splashing people
with wine all night

00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:15.850
and talking about the
wine and the food.

00:35:15.850 --> 00:35:17.280
And it was super cool.

00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:20.760
And we had a great
time doing this.

00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:22.680
And we were able to take
a little more risks,

00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:26.730
because when you're serving
three or four dishes,

00:35:26.730 --> 00:35:30.044
everybody wants the safe items--

00:35:30.044 --> 00:35:31.710
the things that are
going to be popular,

00:35:31.710 --> 00:35:35.340
like garlic bread with
burrata or crab cakes.

00:35:35.340 --> 00:35:39.300
But this particular party
that we sort of took it

00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:42.900
to the next level was, we were
serving lamb tongue on toast,

00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:46.650
and doing things that
were like, well, we built

00:35:46.650 --> 00:35:50.550
that relationship through
the other safer items,

00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:52.440
and people would come
back, and I'd say,

00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:54.339
well, it's pickled lamb.

00:35:54.339 --> 00:35:56.880
And some people, I would tell
them it was tongue, and others,

00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:59.330
I would say it was just lamb.

00:35:59.330 --> 00:36:00.540
But it looked good.

00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:02.340
It looked beautiful
on the plate.

00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:04.680
And we eat first with our eyes.

00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:07.590
And I was able to talk
people into eating food.

00:36:07.590 --> 00:36:10.380
And the buy-in was small--

00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:11.070
one bite.

00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:13.320
So you've got to think
about real estate.

00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:16.530
And so we applied
that same idea.

00:36:16.530 --> 00:36:18.990
And it really matched the
idea as chefs at the time

00:36:18.990 --> 00:36:21.780
that we wanted to create
a restaurant where

00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:25.140
we could cook what we want
and have lots of freedom

00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:28.320
and flexibility, and
not necessarily have

00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:32.640
a specific regional calling.

00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:34.890
We're not a northern
Italian restaurant.

00:36:34.890 --> 00:36:38.370
We're not a Chinese restaurant.

00:36:38.370 --> 00:36:39.870
We've always been
challenged-- and I

00:36:39.870 --> 00:36:42.660
think a lot of American chefs
are challenged thoroughly--

00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:45.932
by how to define
themselves as chefs.

00:36:45.932 --> 00:36:46.890
Like, well, what is it?

00:36:46.890 --> 00:36:50.100
When people ask me, like,
what is it, the food you cook?

00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:51.700
It's really tough.

00:36:51.700 --> 00:36:54.780
Well, I do this
American dim sum.

00:36:54.780 --> 00:36:56.640
It's like California cuisine.

00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:58.950
And really, you look
at our menu and you

00:36:58.950 --> 00:37:00.990
look at the demographics
of the Bay Area,

00:37:00.990 --> 00:37:03.030
and it's a lot of
Asian influence

00:37:03.030 --> 00:37:09.600
and a lot of Mexican influence
and some thorough American

00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:11.482
ingenuity with some European.

00:37:11.482 --> 00:37:12.940
So it's a little
bit of everything.

00:37:12.940 --> 00:37:14.910
And what I like to
actually call that cuisine

00:37:14.910 --> 00:37:18.420
is this evolved
California cuisine.

00:37:18.420 --> 00:37:21.390
We're in a state of
evolution and evolving

00:37:21.390 --> 00:37:24.780
what California cuisine really
is to the people who live here.

00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:26.880
And of course, we're born
and raised in this area.

00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:30.180
So we have a pretty good
understanding of it.

00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:34.740
But to answer your question, we
were doing this kind of thing,

00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:37.290
and we looked at
the kitchen that

00:37:37.290 --> 00:37:39.720
was in the front
of the restaurant,

00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:42.680
and I kind of thought about
ducks hanging in the window.

00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:45.300
And I was like, wow, you've
got cooks right there,

00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:46.410
preparing the food.

00:37:46.410 --> 00:37:48.450
And you enter, and the
first thing you're doing

00:37:48.450 --> 00:37:51.300
is you're entering
through the kitchen--

00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:53.730
it feels that way because
the kitchen's right there

00:37:53.730 --> 00:37:55.680
and the dining
room's in the back.

00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:58.560
And it all kind of
just made sense.

00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:01.120
And we just put the
pieces together.

00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:01.770
And that's it.

00:38:01.770 --> 00:38:04.220
Yeah.

00:38:04.220 --> 00:38:09.970
And people would say,
oh, great concept.

00:38:09.970 --> 00:38:11.970
And I was like, what are
you talking about, man?

00:38:11.970 --> 00:38:13.090
This is my restaurant.

00:38:13.090 --> 00:38:14.910
This is not a concept.

00:38:14.910 --> 00:38:18.540
This is our heart and
soul and our passion

00:38:18.540 --> 00:38:22.660
and our love for cooking
and teaching and interacting

00:38:22.660 --> 00:38:23.380
with people--

00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:25.360
the people who are coming in--

00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:30.340
to have an experience
that was different

00:38:30.340 --> 00:38:31.630
than at other restaurants.

00:38:31.630 --> 00:38:36.100
We looked at it that we're
all one world in the kitchen.

00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:38.456
We get to talk to the guests.

00:38:38.456 --> 00:38:39.580
And the guests get to talk.

00:38:39.580 --> 00:38:40.930
And you know that
feeling you get

00:38:40.930 --> 00:38:42.305
when you're sitting
at a counter,

00:38:42.305 --> 00:38:44.920
and you're watching the
sushi chefs preparing,

00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:45.730
and you're talking.

00:38:45.730 --> 00:38:48.070
And you create this rapport.

00:38:48.070 --> 00:38:52.150
And so it was really
imperative to have that for us.

00:38:52.150 --> 00:38:54.880
We wanted to know the people
we were cooking for, too.

00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:56.420
We want to have
that relationship.

00:38:56.420 --> 00:38:58.840
We want to not have
it be like dining

00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:01.220
room, kitchen, separation.

00:39:01.220 --> 00:39:03.700
And we talk about that all
the time-- front of the house,

00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:04.750
back of the house.

00:39:04.750 --> 00:39:07.490
Well, it applies
to diners as well.

00:39:07.490 --> 00:39:09.730
So anyway, that's kind of it.

00:39:09.730 --> 00:39:12.460
And it really gave
us the ability

00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:16.180
to do whatever we
wanted in the kitchen.

00:39:16.180 --> 00:39:20.560
As long as it tastes good,
looks good, it works.

00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:22.600
So that's it.

00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:23.320
All right.

00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:25.760
I say, let's put
this dish together.

00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:27.500
So our carrots
are nice and soft.

00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:29.714
And you can see that
just in their shape.

00:39:29.714 --> 00:39:31.630
And what I'm going to
do is I'm going to throw

00:39:31.630 --> 00:39:33.820
some butter into the pan.

00:39:33.820 --> 00:39:38.440
And at the same time, you
want to drop about 10 of those

00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:40.810
into the simmering water
that's been salted.

00:39:40.810 --> 00:39:41.890
You guys saw me do that.

00:39:44.542 --> 00:39:46.375
I'm going to take a
couple of these carrots.

00:39:52.626 --> 00:39:54.190
You can leave them
whole, but I'm

00:39:54.190 --> 00:39:55.840
going to cut them up
just a little bit.

00:39:58.650 --> 00:40:00.070
Oh, yeah.

00:40:00.070 --> 00:40:00.820
These are perfect.

00:40:08.260 --> 00:40:11.230
And then I'm going to
take some pickled carrots.

00:40:11.230 --> 00:40:14.750
And the pickled carrots are just
a baby carrot that we pickle.

00:40:14.750 --> 00:40:16.160
And the recipe's included.

00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:19.466
But it's a vinegar pickle.

00:40:19.466 --> 00:40:22.190
So this is not a
fermented pickle.

00:40:22.190 --> 00:40:24.640
And what we like to do is
shave them really thin.

00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:30.290
You can use a knife
for that or a mandolin.

00:40:30.290 --> 00:40:32.691
But if you've got the
knife skills, apply it.

00:40:32.691 --> 00:40:34.190
NICOLE KRASINSKI:
And a sharp knife.

00:40:34.190 --> 00:40:35.564
STUART BRIOZA:
That's what I say.

00:40:35.564 --> 00:40:37.880
And so the idea of having a
pickle in a dish like this

00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:39.390
really makes a lot of sense.

00:40:39.390 --> 00:40:42.530
It adds nice texture contrast.

00:40:42.530 --> 00:40:48.140
It also adds a nice refreshing
acidic balance to it.

00:40:48.140 --> 00:40:50.730
A couple of different
colors here.

00:40:50.730 --> 00:40:53.152
AUDIENCE: Do you use a sweeter
vinegar, or do you use--

00:40:53.152 --> 00:40:54.860
STUART BRIOZA: We do
sweeten the vinegar.

00:40:54.860 --> 00:40:57.770
So we use, for this
one, rice vinegar.

00:40:57.770 --> 00:40:59.900
And we use salt
and a little sugar

00:40:59.900 --> 00:41:02.390
and some spices as well into it.

00:41:02.390 --> 00:41:03.950
And we pickle them whole.

00:41:03.950 --> 00:41:06.110
And then every day,
we'll cut them.

00:41:06.110 --> 00:41:08.780
We'll take them out
of a big pickle crock,

00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:13.350
and we'll cut them, just
as I'm doing it right now.

00:41:13.350 --> 00:41:15.080
I think part of it
is just showcasing

00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:16.970
carrots in different forms--

00:41:16.970 --> 00:41:22.430
whole form, juiced form,
prepared form, and then

00:41:22.430 --> 00:41:23.000
rounds--

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:24.458
pickled, where we
cut it in rounds.

00:41:24.458 --> 00:41:27.920
So you get a real good
environmental scape

00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:31.782
of the carrots, if
that makes sense.

00:41:31.782 --> 00:41:33.740
AUDIENCE: Why vinegar
instead of lacto-ferment?

00:41:33.740 --> 00:41:35.281
STUART BRIOZA:
Because we didn't want

00:41:35.281 --> 00:41:37.520
that lacto-fermented
flavor to it.

00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:40.820
So we do a ton of
lacto-fermenting

00:41:40.820 --> 00:41:43.520
at the restaurant, whether
it's sauerkrauts or kimchis

00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:49.045
or we'll do a dill
carrot, dill pickles.

00:41:49.045 --> 00:41:49.670
And we do that.

00:41:49.670 --> 00:41:52.550
But this one, we wanted
it to be sweeter,

00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:56.270
and just we wanted the vinegar
flavor, which, of course, is

00:41:56.270 --> 00:41:58.550
its own scent of taking it.

00:41:58.550 --> 00:42:04.070
Yeah, we wanted a brightness
to it without quite the salt,

00:42:04.070 --> 00:42:05.960
if that makes sense.

00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:07.310
Cool.

00:42:07.310 --> 00:42:10.040
So these guys are
done when they float.

00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:13.904
And if you can see,
which you can't--

00:42:13.904 --> 00:42:17.040
can we get one of
those moving orbs--

00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:18.650
they're not floating yet.

00:42:18.650 --> 00:42:20.030
Yeah.

00:42:20.030 --> 00:42:24.140
So just like a gnocchi
or any kind of dumpling,

00:42:24.140 --> 00:42:26.230
we would take it and--

00:42:29.990 --> 00:42:31.660
boil, boil boil!

00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:37.310
And what I've done here
is, I'm browning my butter.

00:42:37.310 --> 00:42:38.960
This time, I want
my butter brown

00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:41.060
when I add my dumplings to it.

00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:45.860
So the idea of browning butter
is just that it pulls out

00:42:45.860 --> 00:42:48.060
a nuttiness out of the butter.

00:42:50.570 --> 00:42:55.130
How you know it's brown is
when it stops crackling.

00:42:55.130 --> 00:42:58.670
So all the milk solids have
cooked and tightened up

00:42:58.670 --> 00:42:59.720
and cooked out.

00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:02.460
And then you'll start to
see little particles, which

00:43:02.460 --> 00:43:03.740
is those browning.

00:43:03.740 --> 00:43:06.890
And that's how you
get the brown butter.

00:43:06.890 --> 00:43:08.750
And I have it on
a nice low temp.

00:43:08.750 --> 00:43:10.320
So I can hold this
for a minute here.

00:43:13.740 --> 00:43:17.520
SPEAKER: Other questions while
we wait for the mochi to float?

00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:18.103
Yeah?

00:43:18.103 --> 00:43:20.520
AUDIENCE: Why did you keep
the peel on the garlic?

00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:22.110
SPEAKER: Why did you keep
the peel on the garlic?

00:43:22.110 --> 00:43:23.859
STUART BRIOZA: Ah,
that's a good question.

00:43:23.859 --> 00:43:26.070
It acts as a little
shield, and the garlic

00:43:26.070 --> 00:43:28.740
doesn't brown too fast.

00:43:28.740 --> 00:43:29.430
It's browned.

00:43:29.430 --> 00:43:30.990
It's browned in a nice way--

00:43:30.990 --> 00:43:35.450
a way that I actually love
eating garlic right there.

00:43:35.450 --> 00:43:38.560
But it acts as a little
shield-- a barrier.

00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:40.614
So if you had the raw
garlic to the pan,

00:43:40.614 --> 00:43:42.530
you're still getting the
same qualities of it.

00:43:42.530 --> 00:43:46.020
But when I'm slow
cooking or long cooking,

00:43:46.020 --> 00:43:48.300
I want that garlic
to not get bitter,

00:43:48.300 --> 00:43:50.610
and I want it to
caramelize slowly.

00:43:50.610 --> 00:43:54.278
So that little barrier
is really important.

00:43:54.278 --> 00:43:55.710
Cool.

00:43:55.710 --> 00:43:56.670
Anyone else?

00:43:56.670 --> 00:43:57.480
No?

00:43:57.480 --> 00:44:00.952
NICOLE KRASINSKI: You can do
this step and then chill them--

00:44:00.952 --> 00:44:01.910
STUART BRIOZA: Oh, yes.

00:44:01.910 --> 00:44:03.660
NICOLE KRASINSKI: --and
cook them later, right?

00:44:03.660 --> 00:44:05.243
STUART BRIOZA: So
great, great, great.

00:44:05.243 --> 00:44:11.220
This is another part of
that great margin for error.

00:44:11.220 --> 00:44:14.880
And also, from an entertaining
perspective, and something

00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:17.560
that the team here
at Google has done,

00:44:17.560 --> 00:44:20.190
is that you take them to
this, and you can actually

00:44:20.190 --> 00:44:24.930
cook them, boil them, and then
refresh them under cold water,

00:44:24.930 --> 00:44:26.700
rub them in a little
oil, and put them

00:44:26.700 --> 00:44:28.185
in the fridge for later.

00:44:28.185 --> 00:44:29.560
And then when
you're ready to go,

00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:31.268
you can take them
right out of the fridge

00:44:31.268 --> 00:44:34.170
and put them into your
pan with brown butter

00:44:34.170 --> 00:44:37.030
and just kind of slowly
cook them and reheat them.

00:44:37.030 --> 00:44:38.970
So that's another great
thing, is that you

00:44:38.970 --> 00:44:41.360
can do a lot of this ahead.

00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:43.800
And so now that these
guys are floating--

00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:46.980
you can see they just kind
of come up like any dumpling.

00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:49.620
I like to think these are like
our carrot matsu balls, right?

00:44:52.887 --> 00:44:54.720
I'll just take a slotted
spoon, and I'm just

00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:55.928
going to place them right in.

00:44:58.780 --> 00:45:05.430
And like the carrots, I
love all that brown butter.

00:45:09.150 --> 00:45:14.121
So I'm going to add a little
salt and a good crack of pepper

00:45:14.121 --> 00:45:14.620
to it.

00:45:17.155 --> 00:45:19.280
And what I'm trying to do
is, I want to brown these

00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:20.010
off a little bit.

00:45:26.674 --> 00:45:29.500
And they look so good.

00:45:29.500 --> 00:45:30.380
We'll go on high.

00:45:30.380 --> 00:45:31.630
AUDIENCE: I've got a question.

00:45:31.630 --> 00:45:32.362
STUART BRIOZA: Yeah.

00:45:32.362 --> 00:45:34.330
AUDIENCE: What are you
serving for Super Bowl Sunday?

00:45:34.330 --> 00:45:35.910
SPEAKER: What are you serving
for Super Bowl Sunday?

00:45:35.910 --> 00:45:37.840
STUART BRIOZA: That's
a good question.

00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:42.540
You know, every year, the
kitchens, they team up.

00:45:42.540 --> 00:45:45.430
They should go
opposites, I guess.

00:45:45.430 --> 00:45:49.270
But they do team up between
State Bird and The Progress,

00:45:49.270 --> 00:45:52.000
and they do a huge Super
Bowl Sunday spread.

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:52.930
It's kind of insane.

00:45:52.930 --> 00:45:53.860
NICOLE KRASINSKI:
But for family meal.

00:45:53.860 --> 00:45:54.730
STUART BRIOZA: But
for family meal.

00:45:54.730 --> 00:45:55.230
Yeah.

00:45:56.722 --> 00:45:58.430
NICOLE KRASINSKI: Our
menus don't change.

00:45:58.430 --> 00:45:59.638
But our staff, they have fun.

00:45:59.638 --> 00:46:02.380
They make chicken wings.

00:46:02.380 --> 00:46:03.700
STUART BRIOZA: Yeah.

00:46:03.700 --> 00:46:07.600
Like, Thursday and Friday, I'll
start seeing the wings come in.

00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:14.200
And we really want them to cook
well and do fun things, too.

00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:17.410
And so they do kind
of an insane spread.

00:46:17.410 --> 00:46:21.430
All the holidays and all
the specialty cooking days,

00:46:21.430 --> 00:46:24.380
the kitchens go insane.

00:46:24.380 --> 00:46:26.790
And they're kind of the
best days to be working.

00:46:26.790 --> 00:46:29.122
I think people come in on
their days off, actually--

00:46:29.122 --> 00:46:29.830
SPEAKER: I would.

00:46:29.830 --> 00:46:31.340
STUART BRIOZA: --just
to come in and eat.

00:46:31.340 --> 00:46:31.840
Yeah.

00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:35.890
So we do the classics--
wings, bleu cheese,

00:46:35.890 --> 00:46:38.590
lots of chip and dip.

00:46:38.590 --> 00:46:41.500
So I'm reintroducing the
carrots back into this.

00:46:41.500 --> 00:46:44.500
And I've really
browned that nicely.

00:46:44.500 --> 00:46:47.200
And then let's see here.

00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:49.300
I'm going to use
an unslotted spoon.

00:46:49.300 --> 00:46:51.850
And really, I'm just
looking for a little color.

00:46:51.850 --> 00:46:53.510
The more color
you get on these--

00:46:53.510 --> 00:46:54.250
and you can see--

00:46:54.250 --> 00:46:57.280
look at their buoyancy there.

00:46:57.280 --> 00:46:59.530
They really hold up nicely.

00:46:59.530 --> 00:47:01.150
Can you see that?

00:47:01.150 --> 00:47:03.220
Back to the camera.

00:47:03.220 --> 00:47:04.889
So you can see this buoyancy.

00:47:04.889 --> 00:47:06.430
SPEAKER: Yeah,
they're really bouncy.

00:47:06.430 --> 00:47:07.920
STUART BRIOZA: Yeah.

00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:10.720
They've got a good
bounciness to them.

00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:12.520
And right about this
point, I'm going

00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:15.190
to spoon a few of these
right into a bowl.

00:47:21.660 --> 00:47:22.510
Some of my carrots--

00:47:25.112 --> 00:47:26.820
AUDIENCE: What kind
of butter do you use?

00:47:26.820 --> 00:47:28.486
SPEAKER: What kind
of butter do you use?

00:47:28.486 --> 00:47:32.110
STUART BRIOZA: I use just a
very plain, unsalted butter.

00:47:32.110 --> 00:47:33.100
And that's it.

00:47:33.100 --> 00:47:36.634
We work with a local dairy.

00:47:36.634 --> 00:47:38.050
NICOLE KRASINSKI:
Out of Petaluma.

00:47:38.050 --> 00:47:40.480
STUART BRIOZA: Out of Petaluma.

00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:42.880
But that's our goal
with butter, is just

00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:44.890
a plain, unsalted butter.

00:47:44.890 --> 00:47:47.560
You can always add
salt. It's just

00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:51.040
kind of the cleanest version.

00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:53.980
And then I'm going to put a
little bit of this butter right

00:47:53.980 --> 00:47:57.130
over the top.

00:47:57.130 --> 00:47:58.310
Don't be afraid of butter.

00:47:58.310 --> 00:48:00.801
We talked about that already.

00:48:00.801 --> 00:48:02.715
SPEAKER: The air is
thick with butter scent

00:48:02.715 --> 00:48:03.840
in the room at this moment.

00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:04.050
STUART BRIOZA: That's right.

00:48:04.050 --> 00:48:04.120
Yeah.

00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:04.510
SPEAKER: It smells glorious.

00:48:04.510 --> 00:48:06.370
STUART BRIOZA: It
smells really good.

00:48:06.370 --> 00:48:10.990
So I'm going to take
some gorgeous herbs.

00:48:10.990 --> 00:48:13.360
So things that are very
complementary to carrot

00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:16.150
are mint, dill.

00:48:16.150 --> 00:48:17.830
We have a little
bit of wood sorrel.

00:48:17.830 --> 00:48:19.300
You may see this around.

00:48:21.970 --> 00:48:24.970
It's in season, and it's wild.

00:48:24.970 --> 00:48:25.791
Let's see here.

00:48:25.791 --> 00:48:28.290
First, I going to take a little
bit of this pistachio duqqa,

00:48:28.290 --> 00:48:31.240
and I'm going to give
a nice dusting to it.

00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:35.525
Then I'm going to add some of
my pickled carrots all over.

00:48:35.525 --> 00:48:37.640
Of course, we want to
show off the colors.

00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:44.670
So I sort of smother
it in pickled carrots.

00:48:44.670 --> 00:48:49.520
And then I'm going to add some
of my herbs, which is the mint.

00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:54.020
There's red-veined
sorrel, dill, as I said.

00:48:54.020 --> 00:48:56.480
And then I'm going to
finish the dish up.

00:49:00.670 --> 00:49:07.050
And I'm going to spoon over
the carrot juice vinaigrette.

00:49:07.050 --> 00:49:08.950
And I kind of want
enough of the vinaigrette

00:49:08.950 --> 00:49:13.260
that it's like a sauce on the
bottom, where I can see it.

00:49:16.030 --> 00:49:18.310
And that's about it.

00:49:18.310 --> 00:49:19.874
SPEAKER: It's gorgeous.

00:49:19.874 --> 00:49:21.040
STUART BRIOZA: There you go.

00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:23.317
[APPLAUSE]

00:49:23.317 --> 00:49:24.400
STUART BRIOZA: Looks good.

00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:29.015
Cool.

00:49:29.015 --> 00:49:29.515
Yeah.

00:49:29.515 --> 00:49:30.620
It looks good, right?

00:49:30.620 --> 00:49:31.786
SPEAKER: Yeah, it's amazing.

00:49:31.786 --> 00:49:33.820
STUART BRIOZA: You guys
in the front, hold back.

00:49:33.820 --> 00:49:35.920
SPEAKER: It looks
and smells amazing.

00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:38.280
I know that our team is
working on some delicious

00:49:38.280 --> 00:49:39.550
tastes for you all.

00:49:39.550 --> 00:49:41.340
Are there more
questions while we wait?

00:49:41.340 --> 00:49:41.640
STUART BRIOZA: Yeah?

00:49:41.640 --> 00:49:42.370
SPEAKER: Yeah, wow.

00:49:42.370 --> 00:49:44.570
AUDIENCE: What other exciting
future projects do you have?

00:49:44.570 --> 00:49:45.736
SPEAKER: Ooh, what's coming?

00:49:45.736 --> 00:49:47.250
What future projects
do you have?

00:49:47.250 --> 00:49:48.376
Inside scoop, inside scoop.

00:49:48.376 --> 00:49:50.125
NICOLE KRASINSKI: We
were actually talking

00:49:50.125 --> 00:49:51.645
about that on the drive here.

00:49:51.645 --> 00:49:53.710
It's a good time
to meet in the car.

00:49:53.710 --> 00:49:54.810
There's no distraction.

00:49:56.977 --> 00:49:58.810
STUART BRIOZA: It's an
interesting question.

00:49:58.810 --> 00:50:00.570
And it's not easy to answer.

00:50:00.570 --> 00:50:02.640
Because I don't totally
have the answer.

00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:09.580
And my mind, it's relentless
in the ideas that I want to do.

00:50:09.580 --> 00:50:13.350
But I'm also really about trying
to build the most solid company

00:50:13.350 --> 00:50:16.770
that we can that's got
incredible culture.

00:50:16.770 --> 00:50:19.450
And State Bird started
as 14 employees,

00:50:19.450 --> 00:50:27.330
including Nicole and I.
And now, with The Progress,

00:50:27.330 --> 00:50:31.110
we're up to about just
under 100 employees.

00:50:31.110 --> 00:50:34.230
Both restaurants have
about 50 employees each.

00:50:34.230 --> 00:50:43.080
And in a restaurant world,
it's a lot to see and oversee.

00:50:43.080 --> 00:50:47.100
And State Bird is now six years
old and Progress is three.

00:50:47.100 --> 00:50:49.950
And we're about ready
to start thinking

00:50:49.950 --> 00:50:51.180
about that next project.

00:50:51.180 --> 00:50:52.830
I've been pushing back.

00:50:52.830 --> 00:50:55.940
And we've had lots of
really wonderful offers.

00:50:55.940 --> 00:50:57.900
You know, take State
Bird to New York.

00:50:57.900 --> 00:51:00.870
Take it to Vegas, LA, Tokyo.

00:51:00.870 --> 00:51:03.320
And I'm like, it sounds awesome.

00:51:03.320 --> 00:51:05.220
And it's kind of the
dream when people

00:51:05.220 --> 00:51:08.094
start coming to you with
real ideas and real dreams.

00:51:08.094 --> 00:51:10.260
You're like, yeah, I've
been dreaming of this moment

00:51:10.260 --> 00:51:11.880
my entire career.

00:51:11.880 --> 00:51:13.560
And then you're like, whoa.

00:51:13.560 --> 00:51:15.540
Back up.

00:51:15.540 --> 00:51:18.120
It's actually not
as easy as that.

00:51:21.870 --> 00:51:25.020
And we have a lot of complexity
built into our restaurants.

00:51:25.020 --> 00:51:28.170
We have a farm
that is biodynamic.

00:51:28.170 --> 00:51:30.780
We grow all these
little greens and a lot

00:51:30.780 --> 00:51:34.170
of the carrots and things
that you see in this dish.

00:51:34.170 --> 00:51:35.700
And that's been an
amazing project.

00:51:35.700 --> 00:51:38.700
So rather than
grow up, we've been

00:51:38.700 --> 00:51:43.230
able to kind of add and
kind of grow wide and create

00:51:43.230 --> 00:51:46.860
a lot of really
interesting pieces

00:51:46.860 --> 00:51:50.760
that add value to
what we do every day.

00:51:50.760 --> 00:51:55.260
And that has been probably the
biggest source of inspiration--

00:51:55.260 --> 00:51:59.700
to continue to add and
create this kind of mega-ship

00:51:59.700 --> 00:52:03.210
of this culinary building
because we're all

00:52:03.210 --> 00:52:05.190
under one roof.

00:52:05.190 --> 00:52:11.850
Within that project, we have
a whole fermentation program,

00:52:11.850 --> 00:52:12.570
I suppose.

00:52:12.570 --> 00:52:14.730
We do a lot of charcuterie.

00:52:14.730 --> 00:52:17.370
We do whole animal butchery.

00:52:17.370 --> 00:52:20.640
These things get done in
our commissary kitchen,

00:52:20.640 --> 00:52:24.720
which is just above State
Bird and The Progress.

00:52:24.720 --> 00:52:27.390
And we can take a whole
pig, and certain pieces

00:52:27.390 --> 00:52:30.635
go to State Bird, certain
go to The Progress.

00:52:30.635 --> 00:52:35.070
So we've got this really
amazing cat's cradle

00:52:35.070 --> 00:52:40.230
of a matrix inside our own
building where things are used.

00:52:40.230 --> 00:52:43.230
This is one that we just
launched with the cookbook--

00:52:43.230 --> 00:52:44.400
State Bird Seed.

00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:47.910
It's a partnership with
some very intelligent food

00:52:47.910 --> 00:52:51.810
scientists and
restaurant people, food

00:52:51.810 --> 00:52:55.050
people, who were all
born out of really

00:52:55.050 --> 00:52:58.860
high-quality restaurants--
places like The French Laundry,

00:52:58.860 --> 00:53:05.970
Momofuku, Single Thread
up in Healdsburg.

00:53:05.970 --> 00:53:10.260
So this is their first project
under the [? Render ?] brand,

00:53:10.260 --> 00:53:13.140
where it's a chef-to-shelf
kind of thing.

00:53:13.140 --> 00:53:15.600
And so we're really
focused on this.

00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:18.617
We're actually hoping to see
it here at Google, for example,

00:53:18.617 --> 00:53:19.200
in the snacks.

00:53:19.200 --> 00:53:21.540
SPEAKER: Yes, I'm going to
try to get into the MKs.

00:53:21.540 --> 00:53:22.130
Absolutely.

00:53:22.130 --> 00:53:24.337
STUART BRIOZA: We're
putting a lot of pressure.

00:53:24.337 --> 00:53:25.420
SPEAKER: No, not pressure.

00:53:25.420 --> 00:53:25.505
Excitement.

00:53:25.505 --> 00:53:25.590
Excitement.

00:53:25.590 --> 00:53:26.330
STUART BRIOZA: It's
not meant to be that.

00:53:26.330 --> 00:53:27.466
It's really delicious.

00:53:27.466 --> 00:53:28.590
And it's something we make.

00:53:28.590 --> 00:53:31.150
And there's recipes
for it in the cookbook.

00:53:31.150 --> 00:53:32.691
NICOLE KRASINSKI:
But it is something

00:53:32.691 --> 00:53:33.665
you can buy now online.

00:53:33.665 --> 00:53:35.790
You can order it through
Good Eggs, Mollie Stone's.

00:53:35.790 --> 00:53:37.930
Rainbow and Bi-Rite, both
in the city, have it.

00:53:37.930 --> 00:53:39.509
So there's three flavors.

00:53:39.509 --> 00:53:40.550
We only have two up here.

00:53:40.550 --> 00:53:41.884
But yeah, it's really snackable.

00:53:41.884 --> 00:53:43.841
SPEAKER: I'm going to
start working and as soon

00:53:43.841 --> 00:53:45.120
as I get back from this event.

00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:47.440
STUART BRIOZA: So I guess
that's it right now.

00:53:47.440 --> 00:53:49.010
The other ideas are--

00:53:49.010 --> 00:53:50.400
I gotta keep them--

00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:53.770
people start talking.

00:53:53.770 --> 00:53:58.352
I got to keep it under wraps
until we're ready to unveil.

00:53:58.352 --> 00:53:59.560
SPEAKER: The press gets wind.

00:54:02.089 --> 00:54:02.880
STUART BRIOZA: Yes?

00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:04.338
SPEAKER: Have you
received blowback

00:54:04.338 --> 00:54:07.830
about the not-authentic dim
sum cultural appropriation

00:54:07.830 --> 00:54:08.400
perspective?

00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:10.691
STUART BRIOZA: I think like
any restaurant and any sort

00:54:10.691 --> 00:54:13.530
of public entity,
you're going to get

00:54:13.530 --> 00:54:15.330
believers and nonbelievers.

00:54:15.330 --> 00:54:21.240
And I think we've had a
good mix of that, for sure.

00:54:21.240 --> 00:54:23.410
NICOLE KRASINSKI: For
probably the first 18 months,

00:54:23.410 --> 00:54:26.589
there was a lot more skepticism,
and people didn't quite

00:54:26.589 --> 00:54:28.880
understand why we were doing
it and what we were doing.

00:54:28.880 --> 00:54:31.910
But once the ball
was rolling and we

00:54:31.910 --> 00:54:34.940
were more publicly in
the press and people

00:54:34.940 --> 00:54:38.960
understood what the goal
and the intention was,

00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:42.930
we haven't really had anything--

00:54:42.930 --> 00:54:43.470
any issues.

00:54:43.470 --> 00:54:46.100
STUART BRIOZA: And
ironically, we never actually

00:54:46.100 --> 00:54:48.830
called ourselves a
dim sum restaurant.

00:54:48.830 --> 00:54:51.110
In the early days,
we were more kind

00:54:51.110 --> 00:54:54.770
of akin to tapas
and small plates

00:54:54.770 --> 00:55:01.910
and the idea of realizing
that we're not dim sum.

00:55:01.910 --> 00:55:04.310
I mean, first, we're
serving dinner.

00:55:04.310 --> 00:55:07.550
That completely challenges
the whole notion

00:55:07.550 --> 00:55:09.990
of dim sum, which is
a daytime activity,

00:55:09.990 --> 00:55:15.180
and it's food that's prepared
for tea service and whatnot.

00:55:15.180 --> 00:55:17.200
But we actually have
never called ourselves--

00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:19.890
it's gotten to that point
where other people have.

00:55:19.890 --> 00:55:21.200
And we just go with it now.

00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:23.780
Because it's like, why fight it?

00:55:23.780 --> 00:55:27.590
That was about a year into it.

00:55:27.590 --> 00:55:34.370
I think that when we looked
at the idea of dim sum,

00:55:34.370 --> 00:55:38.280
dim sum was one function
of small plates.

00:55:38.280 --> 00:55:44.750
And if you look at Japanese
izakaya, Spanish tapas,

00:55:44.750 --> 00:55:46.530
Korean banchan--

00:55:46.530 --> 00:55:49.070
all the banchan
that's on plates.

00:55:49.070 --> 00:55:53.010
You look at mezz.

00:55:53.010 --> 00:55:58.040
In Italy, there's kind of
this afternoon wine and snack

00:55:58.040 --> 00:55:58.671
kind of--

00:55:58.671 --> 00:56:00.170
I can't remember
the name right now.

00:56:00.170 --> 00:56:00.994
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:56:00.994 --> 00:56:01.406
STUART BRIOZA: Huh?

00:56:01.406 --> 00:56:01.820
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:56:01.820 --> 00:56:02.861
STUART BRIOZA: Thank you.

00:56:02.861 --> 00:56:04.260
That's it.

00:56:04.260 --> 00:56:05.660
SPEAKER: Thank you, chef.

00:56:05.660 --> 00:56:08.540
We looked at that, and we're
kind of a culmination of all

00:56:08.540 --> 00:56:10.970
these-- the French
hors d'oeuvres party--

00:56:10.970 --> 00:56:13.250
passing hors
d'oeuvres-- canapes.

00:56:13.250 --> 00:56:15.830
We're a little bit of
all of those things.

00:56:15.830 --> 00:56:20.000
And we looked at the Chinese
dim sum model as just purely

00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:25.070
an efficiency model of being
able to deliver food quickly

00:56:25.070 --> 00:56:27.380
on carts and trays.

00:56:27.380 --> 00:56:28.970
We use a lot of
trays, actually--

00:56:28.970 --> 00:56:30.590
more trays than carts.

00:56:30.590 --> 00:56:34.010
But we, over time, have
incorporated more of our carts.

00:56:34.010 --> 00:56:36.110
And we've redone our carts now.

00:56:36.110 --> 00:56:39.170
And we do smaller
carts that can do--

00:56:39.170 --> 00:56:41.490
I can have oysters out
and I can have a big--

00:56:41.490 --> 00:56:42.740
NICOLE KRASINSKI: Chip and dip

00:56:42.740 --> 00:56:45.480
STUART BRIOZA: --clay pot of
pork ribs or chip and dip.

00:56:45.480 --> 00:56:48.020
So there's a little bit of
tableside activity as well.

00:56:50.630 --> 00:56:53.900
The French have the
same type of cart.

00:56:53.900 --> 00:56:55.160
It's called a gueridon.

00:56:55.160 --> 00:56:59.090
And that's where your cheese
is rolled up to your table--

00:56:59.090 --> 00:57:01.760
cheese or Bananas Foster--

00:57:01.760 --> 00:57:05.680
some of the tableside
preparations-- or Caesar salad

00:57:05.680 --> 00:57:06.500
done tableside.

00:57:06.500 --> 00:57:11.000
So we looked at all
these ideas and kind of

00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:13.550
took what we thought
were the best parts

00:57:13.550 --> 00:57:16.640
and turned it to the dining
room and said, how can we

00:57:16.640 --> 00:57:19.370
service the people best?

00:57:19.370 --> 00:57:23.870
We know that tapas don't
work in this country.

00:57:23.870 --> 00:57:28.730
It takes an entire country
and a culture of people that

00:57:28.730 --> 00:57:32.150
are raised from the wee age--

00:57:32.150 --> 00:57:33.920
three to five years old--

00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:37.910
going and having a
little glass of wine

00:57:37.910 --> 00:57:40.610
and moving from
tapas place to tapas

00:57:40.610 --> 00:57:42.860
place because they all have
their little specialties,

00:57:42.860 --> 00:57:44.318
and the food's in
the window there,

00:57:44.318 --> 00:57:47.120
and you just kind
of grab and eat.

00:57:47.120 --> 00:57:50.690
But when tapas was
brought to the US,

00:57:50.690 --> 00:57:54.230
it was the coolest
thing ever, until nobody

00:57:54.230 --> 00:57:55.360
realized that there was a--

00:57:58.220 --> 00:57:59.517
how do you deliver food?

00:57:59.517 --> 00:58:01.475
How do you know it's
enough food for the table?

00:58:04.790 --> 00:58:06.470
A lot of chefs are
taking an entree

00:58:06.470 --> 00:58:09.410
and basically putting it
through the shrinker machine

00:58:09.410 --> 00:58:12.665
and charging 2/3 of
what the entree costs,

00:58:12.665 --> 00:58:14.840
but giving you half as much.

00:58:14.840 --> 00:58:16.380
There was a lot of
problems with it.

00:58:20.960 --> 00:58:23.870
How do you break it down to
the lowest common denominator

00:58:23.870 --> 00:58:27.350
so that everybody can
understand what they're doing?

00:58:27.350 --> 00:58:29.330
And so we took that
tapas and put it

00:58:29.330 --> 00:58:33.440
on wheels, and basically--
here, are you interested?

00:58:33.440 --> 00:58:35.360
Cool. $6-- done.

00:58:35.360 --> 00:58:37.640
Move on to the next.

00:58:37.640 --> 00:58:40.040
You can see the portion size.

00:58:40.040 --> 00:58:43.080
I can sell a lot of
weird food if I want to.

00:58:43.080 --> 00:58:45.959
I can sell things
that people are like,

00:58:45.959 --> 00:58:47.750
I don't even know what
we're talking about.

00:58:47.750 --> 00:58:49.550
Like, you're speaking
a different language.

00:58:49.550 --> 00:58:57.020
But they see it and it's
beautiful, and they'll take it.

00:58:57.020 --> 00:58:58.610
We eat first with our eyes.

00:58:58.610 --> 00:59:01.640
So we basically took the
functionality of all of that

00:59:01.640 --> 00:59:04.100
and took a type of
cuisine that everybody

00:59:04.100 --> 00:59:07.580
loves to eat-- small plates.

00:59:07.580 --> 00:59:08.900
I hear it all the time.

00:59:08.900 --> 00:59:14.110
I prefer to eat lots of little
dishes versus an entree.

00:59:14.110 --> 00:59:15.610
SPEAKER: Everybody
wants more stuff.

00:59:15.610 --> 00:59:16.550
STUART BRIOZA: You're
all shaking your head.

00:59:16.550 --> 00:59:18.380
You're all agreeing with me--

00:59:18.380 --> 00:59:19.850
shaking in agreement here.

00:59:19.850 --> 00:59:20.790
Because you like that.

00:59:20.790 --> 00:59:21.915
SPEAKER: All of the things.

00:59:21.915 --> 00:59:22.887
Yeah, of course.

00:59:22.887 --> 00:59:24.470
STUART BRIOZA: Korean
food is amazing,

00:59:24.470 --> 00:59:28.510
because they kind of slaughter
you with kimchis and tofus

00:59:28.510 --> 00:59:31.572
and cucumbers and sesame
oil and mung bean sprouts.

00:59:31.572 --> 00:59:33.280
And you're getting
all your little things

00:59:33.280 --> 00:59:34.100
and you're tasting.

00:59:34.100 --> 00:59:37.396
And it's like you like all
the diversity of flavors.

00:59:37.396 --> 00:59:38.770
Well, we just took
that same idea

00:59:38.770 --> 00:59:42.310
and applied what I like to call
a little American ingenuity

00:59:42.310 --> 00:59:46.210
to it to make it work
for the American diner

00:59:46.210 --> 00:59:48.130
because tapas doesn't work.

00:59:48.130 --> 00:59:49.970
And it doesn't make sense.

00:59:49.970 --> 00:59:51.820
I'm confused, too.

00:59:51.820 --> 00:59:52.810
Is that enough food?

00:59:52.810 --> 00:59:54.490
And you've got to
ask your waiter.

00:59:54.490 --> 00:59:56.823
And you've got to have this
dialogue where you just want

00:59:56.823 --> 00:59:59.920
to do it yourself and figure it
out, where you're in control.

00:59:59.920 --> 01:00:01.120
SPEAKER: So fantastic.

01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:04.580
We are about to run out of
time for our amazing livestream

01:00:04.580 --> 01:00:05.080
audience.

01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:06.621
I know we have one
more question here

01:00:06.621 --> 01:00:09.070
in the audience which we can
take as soon as the cameras

01:00:09.070 --> 01:00:09.310
wrap.

01:00:09.310 --> 01:00:10.870
But I want to thank
you officially

01:00:10.870 --> 01:00:14.170
for our full audience,
online and here.

01:00:14.170 --> 01:00:16.270
Thank you so much
for joining us today.

01:00:16.270 --> 01:00:18.490
I hope you'll come
back and see us again.

01:00:18.490 --> 01:00:20.240
STUART BRIOZA: Well,
thanks for having us.

01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:22.740
[APPLAUSE]
