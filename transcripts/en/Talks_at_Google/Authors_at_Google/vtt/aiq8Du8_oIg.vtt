00:00:04.844 --> 00:00:06.385
SIMON PERKOWSKI:
Greetings, everyone.

00:00:06.385 --> 00:00:08.189
I'm Simon Perkowski.

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.710
I'm very excited to introduce
Seth Grahame-Smith here today.

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:14.690
He's a "New York
Times" bestselling

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.660
author, screenwriter,
producer, and director.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.700
He sold over two million
copies of "Pride and Prejudice

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.820
and Zombies" as well as "Abraham
Lincoln, Vampire Hunter,"

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.880
both of which have been
adapted for the big screen.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.550
He is working with Tim Burton
on a sequel to the 1988 classic,

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.290
"Beetlejuice," producing
Stephen King's "It,"

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.140
and a spin-off to
"The Lego Movie."

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.760
Today, he's going to
talk about his new novel,

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.170
"The Last American
Vampire," a sequel

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.000
to "Abraham Lincoln,
Vampire Hunter."

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.490
It was just released this month.

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.390
So with that,
let's welcome Seth.

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.603
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:58.860
SETH GRAHAME-SMITH: Thank you.

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.000
Thanks, Simon.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.440
Thank all of you for taking
time out of your day to come

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:08.500
and, I guess, be part of
the inaugural talk at Google

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.800
here at the Tech Corners campus.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.260
I'll be your Guinea
pig for today,

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.410
and I'll try to keep it
light and interactive.

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:22.020
So what I typically
like to do is just

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.260
talk for maybe
seven to 10 minutes,

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.920
and then while I'm
talking, if you guys

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.310
think of questions or things
you want to yell at me

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.540
or challenge me on or et cetera,
then we can have a conversation

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.410
rather than just make
this a monologue.

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:39.510
It's always more
fun for me that way.

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.110
So it's interesting
being here at Google--

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.470
and I've done talks
at other Google sites

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.409
before-- because I
think that you guys are

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:52.450
in the middle of what
publishing is going to look

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:53.950
like in a few years.

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:59.120
I think it's no secret that
physical book sales are

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.080
plummeting-- and that's
putting it kindly.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.120
Barnes and Noble
is the only chain

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.400
left in the United
States of any real power,

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.360
and they are closing stores.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.820
Borders is gone.

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.690
I think Walden books is
either gone or almost gone.

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.390
It's very, very hard
to find shelf space

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.000
to sell a physical
book these days.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.180
And yet people are
reading more than ever.

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.586
They're reading
on their Kindles,

00:02:26.586 --> 00:02:28.210
they're reading on
their iPads, they're

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:30.543
reading on their phones on
the train on the way to work.

00:02:30.543 --> 00:02:35.440
They're listening to books in
their earphones on Audible.

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.420
So it's not that
stories are dead.

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.330
It's not that the sky is
falling and that no one's

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:42.470
going to read anymore.

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.460
But the way that
people are reading

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:48.910
is changing faster than most
people can even keep up.

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.070
And I was telling Simon
before we began today

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.420
that I was on my way to an event
at a physical bookstore in New

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:56.760
York last week.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.760
And to get people to come
out to a physical bookstore

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.500
in 20-degree weather on a
week night in a big city

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.430
where there's a lot of
distractions is very hard.

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.800
And I knew it was going
to be one of those

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.940
we'll-be-lucky-to-have-20-people
kind of events.

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:17.640
And sure enough, as I'm
driving through Times Square

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.490
to go to the event, there
is a huge video wall

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:21.210
in Times Square.

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:23.640
And there's a Google
Play add playing,

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:24.980
the size of a building.

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.520
And there's this big book
that says, play books.

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:28.650
And it's just rotating.

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.670
And it just felt like
there's a message here.

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:33.040
Somebody's telling me something.

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:38.560
And I think that what
you're going to see

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.130
is you're going to
see authors continue

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:42.350
to publish physical books.

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.510
I think there's always going to
be a market for the physical,

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:46.427
to some degree.

00:03:46.427 --> 00:03:49.010
But I think you're going to see
authors self-publishing more--

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.260
and I'm not talking about
people who are starting out.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.029
I'm talking about people
who've sold a lot of books.

00:03:54.029 --> 00:03:55.570
You're going to see
them self-publish

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:57.486
or you're going to see
them doing partnerships

00:03:57.486 --> 00:04:01.430
with Google Play, with
Amazon, and so on and so

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:06.020
forth because you
guys here at Google

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:11.250
have a broader reach in terms of
aggregating content or pushing

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.159
people to media
than any publishing

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:16.200
company in the world,
probably all the publishing

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.740
companies in the world combined.

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:25.260
And so for storytellers like
myself who on the movie and TV

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.210
side have begun doing
direct deals with Netflix

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.400
for original movies
and original shows,

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.510
direct deals-- just the other
day we read about Amazon

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:36.020
is now going to get into the
theatrical movie business,

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:37.551
in the $5 to $25 million range.

00:04:37.551 --> 00:04:39.800
They're going to do a short
theatrical window followed

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.000
by an Amazon Prime
exclusive right

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.980
after the theatrical
window closes.

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:45.140
That's the norm.

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:48.582
It's not that, oh, this is going
to be 5 to 10 years from now

00:04:48.582 --> 00:04:50.040
we'll have to start
thinking about.

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.380
No, it's here.

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:54.980
Publishing in the way
we knew it is over.

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:59.010
Hollywood distribution
and production the way

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:01.460
we knew it is over.

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.630
And that's great because we
shouldn't be afraid of it.

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.370
We should be
celebrating the fact

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:09.100
that we have more
opportunities as storytellers

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.340
to reach people.

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.790
And we have more
opportunities to reach

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:15.200
a targeted group of people.

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:19.600
I mean, say you write a
book about-- you're really

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:23.100
into science fiction about
ducks, just as a weird example

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:24.760
that I don't know
why I just said it.

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:29.610
But in the world
of five years ago,

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:32.940
no one's going to buy a book for
that niche market of people who

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.100
love ducks and love
science fiction.

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:39.390
But now in today's world,
since it costs almost nothing

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:42.390
to distribute electronically,
if you can find someone

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:44.480
willing to put up just
a tiny bit of money--

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:49.390
even if you do it yourself-- to
package that however you have

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:51.840
to format it for
ebooks-- you can now

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:55.030
publish a book about ducks
in a science fiction universe

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:58.960
and reach the three people
who would read that book.

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.710
But that's OK.

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:03.740
And the same is true of an
Amazon Prime show or a Netflix

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:04.660
show.

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:08.100
The same is true of, frankly,
a premium cable show.

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:11.690
You don't have to
reach 20 million people

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:14.343
in order to make it
make economic sense.

00:06:14.343 --> 00:06:21.710
So I get excited being
here because being here

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:25.430
is kind of the opposite
of the way I usually

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:27.370
feel when I walk
onto a studio lot

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:29.610
or into a big publishing house.

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:32.260
There is explosive
growth and nothing

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.280
but upside in this building.

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:38.130
And the opportunities
are presenting themselves

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:42.877
on an almost daily basis in
terms of what Google can do.

00:06:42.877 --> 00:06:44.960
When I published "Abraham
Lincoln, Vampire Hunter"

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:50.910
five years ago, it was roughly
a 50-50 ebook to physical book

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:54.980
ratio, maybe 60-40 in favor
of physical, actually.

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:57.480
Now, five years later
with all those bookstores

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:59.910
that I named earlier,
those chains closed,

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:02.440
there is half the retail
space in the United States

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:04.410
that there was five
years ago for books.

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:08.980
That means half the
shelf space for us

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:12.720
to put our books on for people
to wander into bookstores,

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:15.150
find your book, pull it
off the shelf, and buy it.

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:18.570
So the ratio is
now closer to 70-30

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:22.290
in favor of digital, or
ebook, versus physical.

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:24.210
So the writing's on the wall.

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:28.220
And I think that you're
going to see publishers--

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:31.640
and again, I'm talking
about the James Pattersons

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:36.170
and the Preston and Childs
and the Stephen Kings, even.

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:39.220
I think you're going to
start seeing them experiment

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:41.250
with direct to digital.

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:43.570
And I think you're going to
see people do a publishing

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:48.880
deal with a Google or with
an Amazon directly instead

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:51.285
of going through a Random
House, a Simon and Schuster.

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:55.750
And I'm sure someone
at my publisher's

00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:57.584
going to see this talk
online and freak out,

00:07:57.584 --> 00:07:58.750
and I'm going to get a call.

00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:00.521
But I'm happy, you guys.

00:08:00.521 --> 00:08:01.020
I'm good.

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:01.520
I'm good.

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:03.012
I'm not going anywhere yet.

00:08:03.012 --> 00:08:04.970
I owe you one more book,
contractually, anyway.

00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:05.850
So I can't.

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:12.030
But it's an exciting time.

00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:16.270
It's a scary time to be in
media as a content creator.

00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:20.690
And the first thing that any of
the quote, unquote "old guard

00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:22.380
producers" that I
meet will tell you

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:25.340
is, well, you're not going to
make the kind of money I made.

00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:28.620
And they love telling
you that because

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:31.020
in the heyday of the
'80s and the '90s

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:34.669
when producers and
directors were getting

00:08:34.669 --> 00:08:37.190
25% of first dollar
gross-- which

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:38.620
means that for
every ticket sold,

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:41.520
they get 25% right off the
top into their pockets--

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:42.520
those deals are gone.

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:44.230
Those producer deals are over.

00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:48.090
The Joel Silvers of
the '80s, that's gone.

00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:50.060
You have to now
be lean and mean.

00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:51.980
It's not about
sending in a platoon

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:52.980
to make a movie anymore.

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:54.670
It's about sending
in a SEAL team.

00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:58.710
And that means everybody has
to know how to do seven things.

00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:01.516
So for a guy like me
who-- I can write a movie,

00:09:01.516 --> 00:09:03.390
I can direct a movie,
I can produce a movie--

00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:05.580
it's actually a
pretty good time to be

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:07.450
getting into the business.

00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:13.220
And for you guys, as a company,
it's just extraordinary.

00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:15.320
You think about the
fact that this company

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:17.630
didn't exist 15 years ago.

00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:22.500
And now you can't build
the buildings fast enough.

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:24.060
You're outgrowing campuses.

00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:28.020
It's just extraordinary.

00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:30.220
And it's exciting
to think about what

00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:32.570
that means for somebody like me.

00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:37.750
I also told Simon that--
and I'm not just saying this

00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:40.770
because I'm at Google--
but I am a Chrome user.

00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:43.439
And the Chrome
browser will be open

00:09:43.439 --> 00:09:45.480
whenever I'm writing a
book because my books tend

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:47.813
to deal with a lot of history,
and they're very research

00:09:47.813 --> 00:09:48.380
intensive.

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:52.370
And even as I'm writing, I've
got like 20 Wikipedia tabs

00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:53.010
open.

00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:55.566
And I'm just shuttling around
between tabs in the browser

00:09:55.566 --> 00:09:57.690
or typing something in to
verify something and make

00:09:57.690 --> 00:10:00.590
sure it's historically accurate.

00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:04.820
And then the fact that we
made this book trailer just

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:09.092
to premiere on YouTube
because, again, Google

00:10:09.092 --> 00:10:10.550
is part of the way
we reach people.

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:13.450
Google is now the way
that I research my books

00:10:13.450 --> 00:10:16.667
and write them, and Google
is now a huge part of the way

00:10:16.667 --> 00:10:18.250
that I reach out to
my readers and let

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:20.880
them know the book exists.

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:23.970
And I think that
kind of partnership

00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:26.700
is only becoming more strong.

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:31.796
And eventually, I think
that-- as much as I

00:10:31.796 --> 00:10:33.670
hate to say it because
I love physical books,

00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:39.280
and I grew up in a very physical
book oriented household--

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:41.550
I think that you're
going to be able to buy

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:43.680
physical books in boutiques.

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:47.830
And everybody else is
going to be downloading.

00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:50.495
And as long as we can figure
out how to reach those people

00:10:50.495 --> 00:10:53.260
and get them excited
about stories,

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:56.450
then, frankly, how they
consume them is up to them.

00:10:56.450 --> 00:11:01.219
I'm not a purist in
the sense of, well,

00:11:01.219 --> 00:11:03.010
physical books are far
superior because you

00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:03.840
can feel the weight of them.

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:04.423
You know what?

00:11:04.423 --> 00:11:06.050
It's not about that.

00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:06.965
All the purists.

00:11:09.319 --> 00:11:11.610
The people who will tell you
that vinyl sounds better--

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:14.210
and I'm sure it does.

00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:18.070
But it's not about whether
you listen to it on vinyl

00:11:18.070 --> 00:11:20.060
or listen to it as an mp3.

00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:21.910
It's the content.

00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:22.660
It's the song.

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:26.000
And it's not about whether
you read it on your phone--

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.730
although that's bad
for your eyes, people--

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:34.460
or curled up by the fire with
a heavy 1,000 page novel.

00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:36.180
It's the story.

00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:39.810
So I guess we'll see.

00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:43.510
And there are people who will
vehemently disagree with that.

00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:45.710
There are people who
say it's not the same.

00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:50.540
Well, to them I say, whether
or not it is or isn't, it's

00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:51.340
irrelevant.

00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:52.260
We're going that way.

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.950
So it's get on or get off.

00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:56.626
And I'm excited to
get on because I

00:11:56.626 --> 00:11:58.000
want to keep
writing books, and I

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.220
want people to
keep reading them.

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:04.660
Anyway, so just take
a couple minutes.

00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:06.410
And then I want
to hear questions

00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:10.230
because I really like
to be more interactive.

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:12.320
I did grow up in a very
bookcentric household.

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:14.690
My mother was an editor for
a small publishing company

00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:16.980
in Connecticut, still is.

00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:21.350
My stepfather ran a bookstore,
and he had a mail-order book

00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:22.180
business.

00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:25.562
And so our basement at
home was all shelves.

00:12:25.562 --> 00:12:27.270
And there was literally
the type of thing

00:12:27.270 --> 00:12:29.070
where you were always
stepping over a pile of books

00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:29.611
in our house.

00:12:29.611 --> 00:12:32.179
And we had 5,000
volumes in the basement.

00:12:32.179 --> 00:12:34.345
My stepfather was always
down there doing something.

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:40.080
And he was really into fantasy
and science fiction and horror.

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:41.900
And so when I was
a kid growing up,

00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:44.290
it was Bradbury and
Heinlein and Asimov.

00:12:44.290 --> 00:12:46.280
And it was King
and it was Koontz.

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:48.910
And at a very
inappropriately early age,

00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:51.280
I started grabbing those
books off the shelves

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:53.560
and sneaking little--
there's something

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:55.580
exciting about
reading "The Shining"

00:12:55.580 --> 00:13:02.720
when you're eight-- and
horrible at the same time.

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:04.820
And I became infatuated.

00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:07.880
And I became infatuated
with reading.

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:10.857
And for anyone who does
any writing of their own,

00:13:10.857 --> 00:13:12.690
there's only two ways
to get any good at it.

00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:13.950
And that's write a
lot and read a lot.

00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:14.540
That's it.

00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:17.380
Secret's out.

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:19.620
And so I did a lot of that.

00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:20.980
I wrote my stories.

00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:24.030
And yet, I was fascinated
with the movies.

00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:25.781
From my little town
in Connecticut,

00:13:25.781 --> 00:13:27.530
I had no connection
to the movie business.

00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:28.863
I didn't know anything about it.

00:13:28.863 --> 00:13:29.960
But I was fascinated.

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:31.720
And instead of
cutting out pictures

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:34.360
of sports heroes
and Lamborghinis--

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:40.070
this was the '80s, so
Lamborghinis-- I cut out

00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:42.470
pictures of Francis Ford
Coppola from "Premiere" magazine

00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:45.810
and pasted them on my wall
like they were my idols.

00:13:45.810 --> 00:13:47.560
And so I was that kid.

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:50.430
And I was the kid who had his
own show on the public access

00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:53.410
station and ran around
with the big VHS camera

00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:58.430
making the movies at school
and not extremely popular,

00:13:58.430 --> 00:14:00.840
but that's OK.

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:03.700
And so I went to film school.

00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:06.620
And the whole thing was
about going out to LA

00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:09.110
and getting that big film job.

00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:14.720
And for about 10 years, I was
just another struggling writer

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:18.610
in LA, writing at
night, going to my job

00:14:18.610 --> 00:14:21.190
by day and sort of on
the big hamster wheel,

00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:22.680
not getting anywhere.

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:25.965
And it was only when I went
back and wrote a book, "Pride

00:14:25.965 --> 00:14:29.810
and Prejudice and Zombies,"
about six years ago

00:14:29.810 --> 00:14:31.940
that my film career took off.

00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:35.400
And so it was strange that
this book background that I

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:38.100
had come from and this
fascination with books as a kid

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:41.460
is ultimately what led me
to the movies, in a way.

00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:46.140
And so now I'm lucky
enough to be involved

00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:49.020
in a lot of the things
that Simon mentioned

00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:51.820
and to have worked with
a lot of the people

00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:53.800
that I used to have
plastered on my wall, which

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:56.710
is weird and exciting and scary.

00:14:56.710 --> 00:15:00.510
And I've learned a tremendous
amount from those people

00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:03.380
and from having gone through
the process of making movies

00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:06.820
now a couple times,
spectacularly falling on

00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:09.830
my face at least
once or twice in

00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:13.450
and learning from
that experience.

00:15:13.450 --> 00:15:15.900
And so here I am.

00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:18.220
So does anyone have a question?

00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:20.710
I can keep talking
until-- all right.

00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:23.055
So I see-- yes, sir?

00:15:23.055 --> 00:15:24.930
Oh, and he's going to
make his way to the mic

00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:27.140
because we're going to
do the-- please bring

00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:28.400
your questions to the mic.

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:31.380
This is like a
town hall meeting.

00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:32.050
Yes.

00:15:32.050 --> 00:15:32.747
Yes, citizen?

00:15:32.747 --> 00:15:34.330
AUDIENCE: The first
"Beetlejuice" film

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:37.300
ended with Beetlejuice in a
waiting room with this ticket

00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:39.240
number saying about 9 trillion.

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:41.410
In that way it's taken
25 years to do a sequel?

00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:42.410
SETH GRAHAME-SMITH: Yes.

00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:43.410
That's exactly it.

00:15:43.410 --> 00:15:45.680
It was always planned that way.

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:50.770
Yeah, if you look it's
actually 28 years this year.

00:15:50.770 --> 00:15:51.360
Is it 28?

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:52.810
No, it's next year is 28 years.

00:15:52.810 --> 00:15:55.130
27 years.

00:15:55.130 --> 00:15:58.740
No, I think that the scariest
thing about potentially doing

00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:00.880
a "Beetlejuice"
sequel is the fact

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:02.380
that I feel like
as a writer, there

00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:05.280
are only degrees of how
badly I can screw it up.

00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:09.060
It's not it's not about degrees
of how well I can do it.

00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:11.590
It's about, from the get-go--
because the first film

00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:14.710
is so original
and doesn't really

00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:16.800
beg for a sequel in
any way shape, or form.

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:18.320
And it's been 27 years.

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:22.890
And the world has gotten on
just fine without a sequel--

00:16:22.890 --> 00:16:24.630
although, maybe that's
why there's ISIS.

00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:31.332
But at the same time, I
know that it's something

00:16:31.332 --> 00:16:33.540
that Tim was excited about
returning to and something

00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:36.280
that Michael Keaton was
excited about returning to.

00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:38.220
And based on the
fact that it's always

00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:40.310
the first question
I get anywhere I go,

00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:42.650
it's something
that is still very

00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:44.660
much in the public
consciousness.

00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:47.111
Now, is that a
reason to make it?

00:16:47.111 --> 00:16:47.610
No.

00:16:47.610 --> 00:16:51.550
But if we make it
well, then maybe

00:16:51.550 --> 00:16:54.320
we can become a
self-justifying film?

00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:55.300
I don't know.

00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:57.080
But I wrote the draft
a couple years ago,

00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:58.700
and we've been sort
of kicking around

00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:01.350
how we're going to get a made.

00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:04.040
And if it comes together,
and I hope it does,

00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:06.250
it'll be a very
scary year for me

00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:09.635
because I'll be just
walking that tight rope.

00:17:09.635 --> 00:17:11.510
I don't know what it is
about me and touching

00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:13.900
third rails of cultural
significance-- Abraham

00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:17.430
Lincoln, the Bible, Jane Austen.

00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:19.990
Yeah, I just can't help myself.

00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:22.140
But thank you.

00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:24.210
Yes, sir?

00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:27.640
AUDIENCE: For years, kind
of getting onto shelves

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:31.060
and getting really
publicized required

00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:35.130
working with a production
team and the editors.

00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:37.140
And not only does
that do the gating,

00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:41.540
it, also gets them to help push
you to edit and to move things,

00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:43.530
to become higher
quality, at least

00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:45.060
according to their standards.

00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:47.550
I wonder what you
think will end up

00:17:47.550 --> 00:17:51.160
happening as you no
longer are, as an author,

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:53.559
required to work with
a professional editor.

00:17:53.559 --> 00:17:55.350
SETH GRAHAME-SMITH:
That's a good question.

00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:56.930
There has always
been a relationship,

00:17:56.930 --> 00:18:03.740
as far back as any
real publishing goes.

00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:07.530
Let's say, just for argument's
sake, the 17th or 18th century,

00:18:07.530 --> 00:18:12.010
when you would sell your works
as a serial in a magazine

00:18:12.010 --> 00:18:14.240
and then turn them into a novel.

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:17.520
Certainly in Hollywood, going
back to the dawn of Hollywood,

00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:19.820
there's always been the
producer, the studio.

00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:22.860
There's this relationship
between creator and aggregator.

00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:26.870
And that relationship, and
the collaborative nature

00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:30.530
of that relationship, ultimately
makes content better--

00:18:30.530 --> 00:18:33.910
in theory anyway, and
most of the time it does.

00:18:33.910 --> 00:18:38.030
I think that no matter what
happens to the distribution--

00:18:38.030 --> 00:18:39.490
whether we're
talking about you're

00:18:39.490 --> 00:18:41.410
selling your books
directly through Amazon

00:18:41.410 --> 00:18:44.700
or through Google, you're
selling your movie directly

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:46.870
through Amazon or through
Netflix or what have you

00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:50.450
or just putting it on YouTube--
I think that the things that

00:18:50.450 --> 00:18:52.966
will be the most successful
will be the aggregated content.

00:18:52.966 --> 00:18:54.840
I think that they will
be the edited content.

00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:57.670
I think that there will always
be some kind of relationship

00:18:57.670 --> 00:19:01.100
there because you can't--
there are people who can create

00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:02.160
in a vacuum, all right?

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:04.570
But not all of us are
Paul Thomas Anderson

00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:06.710
or Upton Sinclair.

00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:11.910
We're not all these sort
of self-reliant geniuses.

00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:13.190
Certainly, I'm not.

00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:16.480
I benefit from the
interaction with an editor

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:21.090
or with a producer or director,
an actor, other writers.

00:19:21.090 --> 00:19:25.529
I don't always like the process
of getting notes and having

00:19:25.529 --> 00:19:26.320
to respond to them.

00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:30.250
But getting challenged--
I mean, I say to people,

00:19:30.250 --> 00:19:34.090
your work is going to be
exposed at one point or another.

00:19:34.090 --> 00:19:36.550
Would you like it to be exposed
in a small group of people

00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:38.080
talking about it at a table?

00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:39.790
Or would you like
it to be exposed

00:19:39.790 --> 00:19:43.560
when it goes out into the world
and gets horrible reviews?

00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:46.680
So I think that the work that
is going to continue to be

00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:49.450
the top notch is going
to be the stuff that's

00:19:49.450 --> 00:19:55.556
been put through some
kind of editorial process.

00:19:55.556 --> 00:19:57.430
But, I mean, you could
also point to the fact

00:19:57.430 --> 00:20:02.680
that there are-- I don't
know, you guys tell me.

00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:06.460
How many YouTube videos
get uploaded every minute,

00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:09.100
every hour, every day?

00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:12.240
Of those tens of thousands,
hundreds of thousands,

00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:18.040
millions of videos, maybe-- just
to pull a statistic completely

00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:24.790
out of my butt-- one
thousandth of 1% of those

00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:29.080
will cume more than 100,000
views or even 10,000 views.

00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:31.130
It's probably
something staggering.

00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:35.710
So it's still a very,
very small portion

00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:38.650
of things that aren't
produced in some kind

00:20:38.650 --> 00:20:46.299
of professional sphere or with
some kind of editorial hurdle

00:20:46.299 --> 00:20:47.840
that they have to
clear that actually

00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:52.370
break through and are actually
of any creative significance,

00:20:52.370 --> 00:20:54.810
I guess, if that
makes any sense.

00:20:57.800 --> 00:20:58.430
Anyone?

00:20:58.430 --> 00:20:58.930
Bueller?

00:20:58.930 --> 00:20:59.430
Yes?

00:21:04.184 --> 00:21:05.600
AUDIENCE: Do you
still read books?

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:05.990
SETH GRAHAME-SMITH: Oh, yeah.

00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:06.810
All the time.

00:21:06.810 --> 00:21:14.650
I still read books
because it's my craft.

00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:16.470
And you can't
create in a vacuum.

00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:20.030
And you can't exist as a
creator without knowing

00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:21.210
what else is being created.

00:21:21.210 --> 00:21:23.630
For the same reason that
when I'm writing a TV

00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:27.010
show about a certain subject
or for a certain network,

00:21:27.010 --> 00:21:29.260
I immerse myself in it.

00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:33.830
Because I want to know,
realistically-- I also

00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:36.020
want to know who's
doing it better, always.

00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:40.200
But the most important
reason is I love to do it.

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:42.930
I mean, I have a book--
well, I have an iPad with me.

00:21:42.930 --> 00:21:46.080
But the book I'm reading right
now on the road these last two

00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:49.410
weeks, doing this book tour,
is "In the Garden of Beasts"

00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:51.840
by Erik Larson, which is
a terrific-- if you ever

00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:55.160
read "The Devil in
the White City,"

00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:57.420
the story of the serial
killer at the World

00:21:57.420 --> 00:21:59.920
Expo in the late
1800s, I think it was.

00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:01.970
Erik Larson is a
fantastic guy who

00:22:01.970 --> 00:22:05.730
knows how to tell a nonfiction
historical story in a very sort

00:22:05.730 --> 00:22:07.950
of almost fictional way.

00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:10.790
It's very sensational.

00:22:10.790 --> 00:22:13.270
I get inspired by
watching films by people

00:22:13.270 --> 00:22:14.650
who make films better than I do.

00:22:14.650 --> 00:22:17.360
I get inspired by
reading people who

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:21.520
write more elegantly or
more viscerally than I do.

00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:23.640
And I steal from them,
which is the best.

00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:25.839
You just steal the
tricks that work.

00:22:25.839 --> 00:22:26.380
What is that?

00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:28.960
The good artists imitate,
the great artists steal.

00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:36.880
And I still curl up with a
Stephen King all the time.

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:38.010
I never grew out of that.

00:22:38.010 --> 00:22:41.080
That teenage boy still
loves me some Stephen King.

00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:44.060
I read every new thing
when it comes out.

00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:47.660
I read his 1999
book, "On Writing,"

00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:49.810
every year around the holidays.

00:22:49.810 --> 00:22:51.230
It's sort of a refresher course.

00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:55.152
If anyone in here is
interested in writing fiction,

00:22:55.152 --> 00:22:56.860
do yourself a favor
and pick that book up

00:22:56.860 --> 00:23:00.380
because I don't
know anyone who's

00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:04.780
boiled the craft down to a sort
of more accessible and folksy

00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:10.660
wisdom type of essence
than he did in that book.

00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:11.250
Yes, sir?

00:23:11.250 --> 00:23:14.720
AUDIENCE: So to move the
conversation a little bit

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:17.260
back towards [INAUDIBLE]
or in this case the book,

00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:20.270
I wanted to see when you
were writing this new book,

00:23:20.270 --> 00:23:22.520
what sort of historical
inspirations did you take?

00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:25.930
Were you sitting down
with a AP European history

00:23:25.930 --> 00:23:27.860
textbook saying,
there's a vampire

00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:29.990
in here in some
ways, not others?

00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:32.717
Like, how did you approach
the new time frame?

00:23:32.717 --> 00:23:33.800
SETH GRAHAME-SMITH: Right.

00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:36.087
Well, I knew this was going
to be the story continuing

00:23:36.087 --> 00:23:36.920
from the first book.

00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:39.760
The first book was essentially
the story of Abe Lincoln's

00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:42.480
life, and culminated
in the Civil War.

00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:49.480
So essentially, you're talking
about Abe was killed in 1865.

00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:51.012
So that was the end of story.

00:23:51.012 --> 00:23:52.720
And there is a little
epilogue at the end

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:55.102
of that book where we
jump ahead 98 years

00:23:55.102 --> 00:23:57.310
and sort of tease something
that might have happened.

00:23:57.310 --> 00:24:01.750
And so that was the inspiration
for this story is well,

00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:04.140
what was that 98 years
that we didn't learn about

00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:05.860
at the very end?

00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:07.530
And I kept missing
these characters

00:24:07.530 --> 00:24:08.821
and wanting to go back to them.

00:24:08.821 --> 00:24:12.330
And I had such fun
writing the first book.

00:24:12.330 --> 00:24:15.930
And I thought, well, that 98
years is the story of America.

00:24:15.930 --> 00:24:18.050
It's the American century.

00:24:18.050 --> 00:24:20.100
And where in the
first book we only

00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:23.007
had the Civil War, in this
book we have two world wars,

00:24:23.007 --> 00:24:25.340
we have Vietnam, we have the
space race, we have Hitler,

00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:29.940
we have the Hindenburg,
we have Soviet Union,

00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:32.560
we have the rise of anarchy
and the industrial age.

00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:35.050
And there's so
much history there.

00:24:35.050 --> 00:24:39.710
And telling the story of
the last American vampire

00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:42.820
against the backdrop of,
really, the American century

00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:44.760
seemed like it would
be a lot of fun.

00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:47.600
And it was, but it was
also a lot of work.

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:49.020
And then I just
did what I always

00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:52.490
do, which is I
looked at the broad--

00:24:52.490 --> 00:24:55.880
the sort of Howard Zinn
"People's History of the United

00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:57.580
States" version of
the 20th century--

00:24:57.580 --> 00:25:00.440
and then looked at the
events that were the most

00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:04.830
cataclysmic and the so-called
turning point events,

00:25:04.830 --> 00:25:08.380
and then started to lay those
out and go, OK, well then,

00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:09.850
how would the story
intersect here?

00:25:09.850 --> 00:25:14.400
And how would their-- meaning
Abe and Henry's-- sort

00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:17.140
of involvement in, say,
World War I then lead

00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:24.710
to their involvement in pre-Nazi
Germany or brown shirt Germany?

00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:28.180
So it was just a process
of whittling down

00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:30.100
to the major things
that I wanted to do

00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:35.580
and then researching intensely
those specific things

00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:40.410
and outlining a story that
would weave me through it.

00:25:40.410 --> 00:25:41.497
Yes?

00:25:41.497 --> 00:25:43.080
AUDIENCE: Have you
developed a ritual?

00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:46.429
So in my mind, I'm thinking
of "Misery" and James Caan.

00:25:46.429 --> 00:25:47.970
SETH GRAHAME-SMITH:
That is basically

00:25:47.970 --> 00:25:48.928
how I approach writing.

00:25:48.928 --> 00:25:51.240
Yeah.

00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:55.770
My keyboard is my Annie.

00:25:55.770 --> 00:25:56.870
She hobbles me every day.

00:25:56.870 --> 00:25:57.539
Yes, I'm sorry.

00:25:57.539 --> 00:25:58.330
But what was your--

00:25:58.330 --> 00:25:59.060
AUDIENCE: Do you have a ritual?

00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:00.601
Have you developed
a ritual over time

00:26:00.601 --> 00:26:02.840
now that you do
before or after or--

00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:04.120
SETH GRAHAME-SMITH: Yes.

00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:08.322
Heavy, heavy breathing
exercises and yoga-- no.

00:26:08.322 --> 00:26:12.540
Heavy, heavy coffee
consumption, unfortunately.

00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:15.570
My ritual is that I
treat writing like a job.

00:26:15.570 --> 00:26:18.480
I do it seven days a week, no
matter where in the world I am,

00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:22.200
even if I do it on a
plane or on a pad of paper

00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:24.560
between meetings.

00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:28.480
I have note files
on my phone that

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:31.750
run very deep in terms
of continuing stories

00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:32.830
where I left off.

00:26:32.830 --> 00:26:38.430
But mostly, when I'm in home
base, which is Los Angeles,

00:26:38.430 --> 00:26:40.980
I have an office
in the city where

00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:42.480
I go Monday through Friday.

00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:46.210
I show up in the morning,
sit down at my desk,

00:26:46.210 --> 00:26:48.380
and I write for
about three hours.

00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:53.340
And then the middle of the day
is for emails, calls, meetings,

00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:55.870
other projects, film
projects, television.

00:26:55.870 --> 00:26:59.110
And then I have lunch,
and then I come back,

00:26:59.110 --> 00:27:01.740
and I do another two and a half,
three hours in the afternoon.

00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:05.010
And those are my roughly
six hours-- five and a half,

00:27:05.010 --> 00:27:08.560
six hours of writing a
day, Monday through Friday.

00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:11.450
If I'm writing a book, or if
it's an especially intense

00:27:11.450 --> 00:27:14.546
time, I'll add a
third shift at home.

00:27:14.546 --> 00:27:15.670
I'll go to the home office.

00:27:15.670 --> 00:27:20.810
I'll put my two little sons in
the bathtub and put them to bed

00:27:20.810 --> 00:27:23.640
and get a third cup of coffee
and say, good night, wife,

00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:27.350
and go and disappear into
my hellhole for another two

00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:29.420
hours, probably--
two, three hours,

00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:31.280
depending on what I'm doing.

00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:35.320
And then on the
weekends, usually it's

00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:38.987
doing dad stuff during the
day and then writing at night.

00:27:38.987 --> 00:27:39.820
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:42.270
SETH GRAHAME-SMITH:
Thank you very much.

00:27:42.270 --> 00:27:44.010
Yes, sir?

00:27:44.010 --> 00:27:47.159
AUDIENCE: So another
thing about moving away

00:27:47.159 --> 00:27:49.450
from physical books-- I feel
like, to a certain extent,

00:27:49.450 --> 00:27:52.760
there's a sentimental
value of having

00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:57.050
a physical book by your favorite
author, possibly signed.

00:27:57.050 --> 00:28:03.237
And do you see the
market of that?

00:28:03.237 --> 00:28:04.070
How do you see that?

00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:05.870
SETH GRAHAME-SMITH: I don't
think that physical books are

00:28:05.870 --> 00:28:07.370
ever going to
completely disappear.

00:28:07.370 --> 00:28:10.230
I think there will always be
a market for physical media.

00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:14.560
You're looking at a guy who
still buys movies on Blu-ray.

00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:17.570
And, by the way, if I
have a favorite movie,

00:28:17.570 --> 00:28:23.490
I will download it
through either iTunes

00:28:23.490 --> 00:28:25.710
or-- through Play, through Play!

00:28:25.710 --> 00:28:26.409
I'm sorry.

00:28:26.409 --> 00:28:27.450
What was I talking about?

00:28:29.791 --> 00:28:30.290
Right.

00:28:30.290 --> 00:28:31.130
I'll open Chrome.

00:28:31.130 --> 00:28:32.046
I'll go to BitTorrent.

00:28:32.046 --> 00:28:36.190
No, never.

00:28:36.190 --> 00:28:38.970
And then I will also buy
the physical version,

00:28:38.970 --> 00:28:39.760
just so I have it.

00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:41.090
I am a collector.

00:28:41.090 --> 00:28:42.660
And the same is true of books.

00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:45.940
The books that I love, they're
on my Kindle or my iPad.

00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:47.190
But they're also physical.

00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:49.890
I buy the physical because
I want them on my shelf

00:28:49.890 --> 00:28:51.770
because when you walk
into someone's home--

00:28:51.770 --> 00:28:53.811
and this is probably still
a generational thing--

00:28:53.811 --> 00:28:56.090
but their bookshelf
looks back at you

00:28:56.090 --> 00:28:58.390
and is a representation
of at least how they

00:28:58.390 --> 00:29:00.330
want you to see them.

00:29:00.330 --> 00:29:02.200
So it could be, look
at how smart I am

00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:04.115
or look at how much
I love vampires.

00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:09.660
So no, I didn't mean to
say that the physical is

00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:10.660
going to disappear.

00:29:10.660 --> 00:29:16.400
I think that physical
books will become vinyl.

00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:18.870
And if you look at
vinyl, the vinyl sales

00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:20.480
from five years
ago, six years ago

00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:24.650
are actually way up because
it went away for a while.

00:29:24.650 --> 00:29:26.600
And then it became cool.

00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:31.280
And now everyone in
Brooklyn buys vinyl.

00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:35.420
But I think that books,
just for the very reason

00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:38.030
you said, that the physical--
just like I don't think

00:29:38.030 --> 00:29:40.310
retail will ever completely
disappear because there's

00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:43.184
something about going into a
store not knowing what you want

00:29:43.184 --> 00:29:44.600
and just feeling
things and having

00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:46.780
a tactile retail experience
that people are always

00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:48.652
going to crave.

00:29:48.652 --> 00:29:49.360
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:50.480
SETH GRAHAME-SMITH: Thank you.

00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:50.790
Yes, sir.

00:29:50.790 --> 00:29:51.956
Do you want to close it out?

00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:57.060
AUDIENCE: A question
on your-- starting

00:29:57.060 --> 00:29:59.950
with your "Pride and
Prejudice and Zombies,"

00:29:59.950 --> 00:30:03.961
you kind of supposedly
created the mash-up market.

00:30:03.961 --> 00:30:05.460
SETH GRAHAME-SMITH:
People say that.

00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:06.530
I didn't say that.

00:30:06.530 --> 00:30:08.550
AUDIENCE: What was your
inspiration and process,

00:30:08.550 --> 00:30:10.950
that you suddenly came
up with this kind of idea

00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:12.180
of these coming together?

00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:14.210
And then the second
part is, do you

00:30:14.210 --> 00:30:17.230
think because you're going
to the digital media, the way

00:30:17.230 --> 00:30:19.880
that you write, the output
you kind of produce,

00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:23.600
how is that maybe changing
versus your primary market

00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:24.226
being physical?

00:30:24.226 --> 00:30:25.558
SETH GRAHAME-SMITH: Interesting.

00:30:25.558 --> 00:30:28.355
For the first part, I can't
take credit for the inspiration.

00:30:28.355 --> 00:30:32.200
The inspiration belongs to a
man named Jason Rekulak, who

00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:33.860
was my editor at
a small publishing

00:30:33.860 --> 00:30:35.990
company in Philadelphia
called Quirk.

00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:38.070
And I had been pestering
him about wanting

00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:39.680
to write something fictional.

00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:43.290
And they weren't a
fictional house back then.

00:30:43.290 --> 00:30:45.580
I had written some
books for them

00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:48.610
that-- well, I'll let you look
them up if you feel like it.

00:30:48.610 --> 00:30:51.310
But they're different.

00:30:51.310 --> 00:30:53.360
And I loved working
for them, but I

00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:55.100
was dying to do
something fictional.

00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:56.850
And it was Jason who
came up with the idea

00:30:56.850 --> 00:30:58.940
of, well, why don't we put
something weird with something

00:30:58.940 --> 00:30:59.670
old?

00:30:59.670 --> 00:31:02.770
And so he had made this list.

00:31:02.770 --> 00:31:05.830
On the left-hand
column was "Wuthering

00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:07.970
Heights" and "Janey Eyre"
and "Pride and Prejudice"

00:31:07.970 --> 00:31:10.830
and "Sense and Sensibility".

00:31:10.830 --> 00:31:14.500
And on the right, it was
ninjas, pirates, werewolves.

00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:16.250
And he was just sitting
there at his desk

00:31:16.250 --> 00:31:18.060
and just drawing connections.

00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:20.770
And he called me, and he said--
and I'll never forget this call

00:31:20.770 --> 00:31:22.936
because it's the call that
completely turned my life

00:31:22.936 --> 00:31:25.019
upside-down-- what about
"Pride and Prejudice"

00:31:25.019 --> 00:31:25.810
with zombies in it?

00:31:25.810 --> 00:31:28.650
And I just said, I'll have
it for you in six weeks.

00:31:28.650 --> 00:31:30.560
I was so excited.

00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:32.980
I literally remember I was
in my little apartment,

00:31:32.980 --> 00:31:34.860
just jumping up and down.

00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:37.261
I read every Jane Austen book.

00:31:37.261 --> 00:31:38.510
Well, I didn't read every one.

00:31:38.510 --> 00:31:40.176
I don't think I read
"Northanger Abbey."

00:31:40.176 --> 00:31:44.330
But, anyway, I read the big
ones and just immersed myself

00:31:44.330 --> 00:31:47.350
in the voice and in the
period and annotated

00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:50.320
my little "Pride and Prejudice"
copy with all my little ideas,

00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:52.880
and then just sat down
writing for six weeks

00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:54.770
and dashed it out.

00:31:54.770 --> 00:31:57.260
Now, the second
part, I don't know,

00:31:57.260 --> 00:31:59.410
is the short answer,
how my process

00:31:59.410 --> 00:32:02.134
is going to change as things
become sort of more digital.

00:32:02.134 --> 00:32:03.800
I think that you've
already seen people,

00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:08.110
like the aforementioned
Stephen King,

00:32:08.110 --> 00:32:11.340
experiment with
serialization on the web.

00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:13.540
He did it with-- it was
called "Ride the Bullet."

00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:16.040
And then he did it
with "The Green Mile."

00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:20.380
And I think that
serializing online

00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:24.690
and maybe doing a
paper chapter basis--

00:32:24.690 --> 00:32:28.620
or even I've
thought about, well,

00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:30.590
what if you release
a book as an app?

00:32:30.590 --> 00:32:33.350
And each chapter is
essentially an in-app purchase?

00:32:33.350 --> 00:32:35.290
So the app is free,
and you get the first,

00:32:35.290 --> 00:32:37.630
say, three chapters
of a book for free.

00:32:37.630 --> 00:32:39.040
Then if you want
to keep reading,

00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:41.069
the next three
chapters are $1.99.

00:32:41.069 --> 00:32:42.360
And the next few chapters are--

00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:44.680
So I think this is
where we're headed.

00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:47.670
I don't know how it'll
change the writing process

00:32:47.670 --> 00:32:49.350
other than maybe the
end of each chapter

00:32:49.350 --> 00:32:52.426
will have to be really enticing.

00:32:52.426 --> 00:32:53.925
Every chapter will
be a cliffhanger.

00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:57.580
But we'll see.

00:32:57.580 --> 00:33:00.380
All I know is that
it is going to change

00:33:00.380 --> 00:33:02.820
and that we're going to
have to change with it

00:33:02.820 --> 00:33:06.574
and that everybody here is
working for a company that's

00:33:06.574 --> 00:33:08.240
going to be a major
part of that change.

00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:13.590
And so I'm glad we all have
had this chance to chat.

00:33:13.590 --> 00:33:16.080
I'm really appreciate that
you guys took the time

00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:18.580
and really appreciative to Simon
and everyone here at Google

00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:20.080
for having me back
for another talk.

00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:21.477
And I love being here.

00:33:21.477 --> 00:33:22.560
So give yourselves a hand.

00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:23.597
Thank you so much.

00:33:23.597 --> 00:33:24.180
Appreciate it.

00:33:24.180 --> 00:33:24.990
Thank you.

00:33:24.990 --> 00:33:28.040
