00:00:08.046 --> 00:00:08.956
&gt;&gt;Derek Pierce: In our first year,

00:00:08.956 --> 00:00:12.336
we were often perceived
as all over the place.

00:00:12.336 --> 00:00:15.276
We were perceived as we must
be an elite private school only

00:00:15.276 --> 00:00:18.926
for gifted kids, to we are a
school for all special-ed kids,

00:00:19.216 --> 00:00:22.866
to we are a school that
was a money siphon,

00:00:22.866 --> 00:00:28.186
a literal vacuum sucking precious
resources from the rest of the city,

00:00:28.486 --> 00:00:32.376
and so it's taken time for people
to understand that we're more

00:00:32.376 --> 00:00:34.976
than a sound bite, and it's
complicated to explain what we do,

00:00:34.976 --> 00:00:38.926
but we are for all kids, the same
per pupil as other high schools

00:00:38.926 --> 00:00:41.936
in the district, and everybody
would complain about what that is,

00:00:42.186 --> 00:00:44.356
but we also had to
start with no inventory.

00:00:44.356 --> 00:00:49.246
So, we had to with the same amount
of money create new curriculum

00:00:49.246 --> 00:00:50.516
and create new possibilities.

00:00:50.826 --> 00:00:53.426
We do not have a very
textbook-driven curriculum.

00:00:53.426 --> 00:01:00.496
We have some as resources, but we
use primarily laptops for our--

00:01:00.496 --> 00:01:06.126
in the role of textbooks in some
senses, and we use the field.

00:01:06.126 --> 00:01:08.706
We use the city around us as a
textbook, and we get our kids

00:01:08.706 --> 00:01:12.496
out in the field a couple times
a month working with experts

00:01:12.496 --> 00:01:16.456
that may range from local
businessmen to, you know, fishermen

00:01:16.456 --> 00:01:18.466
and scientists and
university professors

00:01:18.466 --> 00:01:21.296
and whoever may be relevant to
the work our kids are doing.

00:01:22.256 --> 00:01:26.666
We know that what matters to parents
in the broader community is outcomes,

00:01:26.946 --> 00:01:31.106
and so on the two most important
outcomes we've done pretty well.

00:01:31.106 --> 00:01:33.866
A hundred percent of our first
graduating class were accepted

00:01:33.866 --> 00:01:37.136
into college, seventy-five
percent to four-year schools.

00:01:37.546 --> 00:01:44.056
On the state test, which includes
the SATs in the state of Maine,

00:01:44.056 --> 00:01:46.106
we've exceeded state and city average

00:01:46.106 --> 00:01:48.916
on every single test:
reading, science, math.

00:01:48.916 --> 00:01:52.676
That said, we're the last place to
be accused of teaching to the test.

00:01:52.676 --> 00:01:56.846
Our curriculum is driven by learning
expeditions, as they are at King.

00:01:57.226 --> 00:02:02.266
We do two expeditions each year,
one that's math-science-driven,

00:02:02.436 --> 00:02:03.886
one that's humanities-driven.

00:02:04.136 --> 00:02:08.576
Those expeditions usually
involve multiple classes.

00:02:08.576 --> 00:02:12.956
They may range in length from two or
three weeks to six or seven months,

00:02:13.376 --> 00:02:16.556
and they involve kids in
doing what we call real work

00:02:16.896 --> 00:02:18.736
for a real audience, work that they--

00:02:18.736 --> 00:02:24.676
work that kids are clear that they're
going to change the world potentially

00:02:24.676 --> 00:02:27.306
through what they're doing,
one project at a time.

00:02:28.256 --> 00:02:31.816
The expedentiary learning allows you
to do kind of in-depth case studies

00:02:32.216 --> 00:02:38.596
that have a broader relevance, the
idea that if you look really tightly

00:02:40.826 --> 00:02:43.936
at the particular in a
very compelling case study

00:02:44.146 --> 00:02:46.666
that you can get the broader
lessons that you can apply all

00:02:46.666 --> 00:02:49.856
over the place, so it's very much
a depth-over-breadth approach.

00:02:50.236 --> 00:02:54.436
And we pick case studied that we
know will be meaningful to our kids,

00:02:54.626 --> 00:02:59.056
from Portland's working
waterfront to a Rwandan genocide,

00:02:59.056 --> 00:03:01.816
because we know we have kids who're
going to directly connect to that.

00:03:02.756 --> 00:03:05.706
By year's end, every
single kid is up in front

00:03:05.706 --> 00:03:07.236
of the school for some reason.

00:03:07.236 --> 00:03:10.346
Say it's reading something they've
written, performing something,

00:03:10.626 --> 00:03:11.956
paying tribute to another kid.

00:03:11.956 --> 00:03:15.036
We have conferences a
couple times a year.

00:03:15.036 --> 00:03:18.786
We have a final word, where every
single senior has to give a speech

00:03:18.786 --> 00:03:22.756
to the entire senior class about who
they are and where they're going.

00:03:22.756 --> 00:03:25.046
We do something similar at the end
of sophomore year, where they have

00:03:25.046 --> 00:03:29.106
to present their work to their
peers and parents and outside folks,

00:03:29.476 --> 00:03:32.976
so kids have to kind of stand
up and say, "Here's who I am".

00:03:32.976 --> 00:03:35.286
So, we really emphasize that piece,

00:03:35.326 --> 00:03:40.626
because we think that's a skill
that's very undervalued in schools

00:03:40.626 --> 00:03:44.016
and highly transferrable and
helps establish who a kid is

00:03:44.016 --> 00:03:46.116
and gives them a confidence
that they can carry on.

00:03:47.086 --> 00:03:48.756
It starts with fantastic teachers,

00:03:48.796 --> 00:03:53.286
and to me that's potentially
the scarcest commodity

00:03:53.286 --> 00:03:56.286
but the commodity that's most
essential to make a great school.

00:03:56.286 --> 00:03:57.676
And you have to find people who are--

00:03:58.036 --> 00:03:59.916
it's missionary work
doing this kind of work.

00:03:59.916 --> 00:04:01.966
It's extremely hard, I think.

00:04:01.966 --> 00:04:05.726
Our teachers recognize that
collaborative work leads

00:04:05.726 --> 00:04:10.136
to better results, leads to
more fulfilling work for the--

00:04:10.136 --> 00:04:13.116
it makes educational work
more sustainable for them,

00:04:13.366 --> 00:04:16.016
makes it more rewarding;
however, it's harder.

00:04:16.016 --> 00:04:17.896
It takes more time,
and if you're trying

00:04:17.896 --> 00:04:20.816
to not only create great
curriculum in your own classroom

00:04:21.086 --> 00:04:23.016
but have it sync with
other people's curriculum

00:04:23.246 --> 00:04:25.006
and have it all culminate
meaningfully

00:04:25.176 --> 00:04:28.016
and meet core state learning
standards at the same,

00:04:28.066 --> 00:04:30.366
that's an incredible challenge
like making a great meal.

00:04:30.366 --> 00:04:33.536
You got to have the turkey and the
mashed potatoes, and all that's got

00:04:33.536 --> 00:04:37.786
to come-- be ready all at once and
all taste good and go well together.

00:04:37.786 --> 00:04:43.256
And that's a lot harder than just
making the stuffing, but it's richer,

00:04:43.256 --> 00:04:48.086
and so I think our faculty, they
don't want to go anywhere else.

00:04:48.086 --> 00:04:50.926
We've been very successful
in terms of turnover.

00:04:50.926 --> 00:04:54.496
We have very little turnover, because
people are really thrilled to be

00:04:54.496 --> 00:04:57.596
where they are, even though
the work is unbelievably hard.

00:04:58.516 --> 00:05:02.576
Our teachers are together for a week
in the summer, and it's essential

00:05:02.576 --> 00:05:04.246
to planning the long-term
expeditions.

00:05:04.246 --> 00:05:07.336
It's during that week when
they're in their teacher teams,

00:05:07.336 --> 00:05:09.606
grade-level teams for a
couple-- just a couple days.

00:05:09.606 --> 00:05:12.756
It doesn't take more than that
to get a vision for the year,

00:05:12.756 --> 00:05:14.996
and then that vision for the year
is going to change, of course.

00:05:14.996 --> 00:05:17.426
It's going to morph, but
it really helps to kind

00:05:17.426 --> 00:05:18.906
of anchor the whole year's work.

00:05:19.296 --> 00:05:21.906
Without that week, I don't
think we could do what we do,

00:05:21.906 --> 00:05:27.616
but it's only a week and it's crazy
that schools don't have 15 days

00:05:27.616 --> 00:05:31.456
of staff development, because
that to me is the biggest lever

00:05:31.456 --> 00:05:35.416
of change is giving teachers time to
talk to one another about curriculum

00:05:35.416 --> 00:05:39.446
and then during the year to talk
regularly about curriculum and kids.

00:05:40.386 --> 00:05:43.866
There have to be knowable
communities of learners and teachers

00:05:43.866 --> 00:05:46.366
that work together and stay
together for a couple years,

00:05:46.366 --> 00:05:51.366
and that can happen through
looping, teaming, advisory practices

00:05:51.646 --> 00:05:53.176
and typically all at once.

00:05:53.176 --> 00:05:56.636
I mean, to me there is no one
structure that fits everything,

00:05:56.636 --> 00:06:00.706
and I think sometimes schools
try to change too incrementally

00:06:00.706 --> 00:06:04.576
to make substantive difference,
and you need to have--

00:06:04.576 --> 00:06:07.366
if you're driven by a
value like relationships

00:06:07.366 --> 00:06:10.446
and you form the structures of your
schools around that kind of value,

00:06:10.446 --> 00:06:12.576
then all sorts of structures
are going to change.

00:06:12.956 --> 00:06:17.146
And it's the system of those
structures about personalization

00:06:17.146 --> 00:06:19.046
and relationships that
really have the impact.

00:06:19.046 --> 00:06:22.016
The impacts tends to kind
of grow exponentially

00:06:22.016 --> 00:06:27.366
if those structures are consistent
and build on one another.

00:06:28.336 --> 00:06:32.716
Too many schools say, "We
can't do the field work.

00:06:32.716 --> 00:06:35.526
We can't get the kids out, because
then I'll tick off that teacher

00:06:35.526 --> 00:06:37.916
down the hall because I'm pulling
my kids out of their class".

00:06:38.216 --> 00:06:39.396
But if you have this team approach

00:06:39.396 --> 00:06:40.616
and there's a recognition:
"You know what?

00:06:40.616 --> 00:06:44.376
I'm going to do humanities-based
field work, because we all need

00:06:44.376 --> 00:06:46.886
to work together towards that end,
but the math-science field work,

00:06:46.886 --> 00:06:47.906
that's going to happen this spring.

00:06:47.906 --> 00:06:52.306
You'll get more time," and that
kind of negotiation can happen

00:06:52.306 --> 00:06:56.286
if you're sharing kids
and sharing purposes.

00:06:56.656 --> 00:07:00.136
So, I think given autonomy
to teachers even

00:07:00.136 --> 00:07:03.516
in a big school can help not make the
schedule the dictator of learning,

00:07:03.516 --> 00:07:06.096
because if it is, you're just
really limiting yourself.

00:07:06.096 --> 00:07:08.836
