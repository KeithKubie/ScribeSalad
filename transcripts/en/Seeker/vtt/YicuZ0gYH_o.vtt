00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.000
We last popped up to the moon in 1972.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.680
But now, the USA is going to work with Russia
to head back to orbit ol’ Luna… on the

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:08.930
way to Mars.

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:10.840
Is your Space Race bone tingling?

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:15.110
Right now, the International Space Station
is slated to be abandoned by NASA in 2024.

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.449
And, like Geocities, one day, it will just
be a memory, but now we might see what’s

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:20.449
next…

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:25.720
A few weeks ago, NASA and Roscosmos announced
they’d work together to build the “Deep

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.389
Space Gateway” a space station near the
moon offering a “deep space environment…

00:00:30.389 --> 00:00:33.140
for human missions that push further into
the solar system.”

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.940
and to “the lunar surface.”

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.100
Does this mean we’re going back to the moon?!

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:43.390
USA (and Russia), USA (and private corporations),
USA (if this actually happens, woo!)

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:49.020
The gateway is slated to be a public-private
partnership where astronauts can try out technologies

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.329
needed to go into deep space, all while orbiting
the moon.

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:55.429
That said, NASA’s not really given a concrete
goal.

00:00:55.429 --> 00:01:01.640
They’re not, like, testing specific things,
the announcements just said “new technologies.”

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.630
Russia handles docking tech, we’ve got orbits pretty much
licked… long-term space travel we do on

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.740
the ISS… maybe a new airlock!

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.659
And some kind of deep-space transport...

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.000
They mentioned “confidence...”

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.250
When it comes to specifics, it’s unclear.

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.630
Proponents of the plan say, we should get
really good at moon missions before going

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:23.630
to Mars.

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.200
Meanwhile, opponents say this could tie up
resources in Lunar exploration, meaning a

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.550
trip Mars could disappear into the distant
future.

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:36.280
The Gateway news should make the Mars-or-Bust
crowd nervous, because we were aiming to go

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:42.860
to Mars by 2033… but the Gateway won’t
be fully realized until the late 2020s.

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.520
Sooooo… shrug?

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.659
Going to space and trying new things does
drive innovation.

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:49.500
What will this new space endeavor bring us?

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.119
I’m not sure… without a concrete goal,
it seems like we’re trying out an ISS, only,

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.130
it’s a few days farther away.

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.000
Space exploration yielded satellite communications,
cordless technology, LEDs, solar power, water

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.300
purification, digital cameras, literally hundreds
of things.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.200
I hope I live long and prosper, so I can find
out if the Gateway can live up to the hype.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.800

We used to spend lots of billions on space travel,

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.280
so, what would happen if we doubled NASA’s budget? Find out here

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.240
So far, we’ve spent 65 billion dollars on International Space Station, not actually that much

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.240
The new F-35 fighter jet? 400 billion.
