00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:05.640
Today I'm speaking about
the first of the three great

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.620
partial differential equations.

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.710
So this one is called Laplace's
equation, named after Laplace.

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:16.780
And you see partial derivatives.

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:19.950
So we have-- I don't have time.

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:24.160
This equation is
in steady state.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.850
I have x and y, I'm
in the xy plane.

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:32.320
And I have second
derivatives in x and then y.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.730
So I'm looking for
solutions to that equation.

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.370
And of course I'm given
some boundary values.

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:41.820
So time is not here.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.880
The boundary
values, the boundary

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.870
is in the xy plane,
maybe a circle.

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.810
Think about a circle
in the xy plane.

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:54.470
And on the circle, I
know the solution u.

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.760
So the boundary values
around the circle are given.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.160
And I have to find
the temperature

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.590
u inside the circle.

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:07.560
So I know the temperature
on the boundary.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.670
I let it settle down and I want
to know the temperature inside.

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:19.020
And the beauty is, it solves
that basic partial differential

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.080
equation.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.240
So let's find some solutions.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.390
They might not match
the boundary values,

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.300
but we can use them.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.320
So u equal constant certainly
solves the equation.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.410
U equal x, the second
derivatives will be 0.

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:36.700
U equal y.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.430
Here is a better one, x
squared minus y squared.

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:45.070
So the second derivative
in the x direction is 2.

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.370
The second derivative in
the y direction is minus 2.

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:51.710
So I have 2, minus 2,
it solves the equation.

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.480
Or this one, the second
derivative in x is 0.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:01.580
Second derivative in y is 0,
those are simple solutions.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.230
But those are only
a few solutions

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:08.770
and we need an infinite
sequence because we're going

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.960
to match boundary conditions.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.240
So is there a pattern here?

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.530
So this is degree 0, constant.

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.180
These are degree 1, linear.

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.450
These are degree 2, quadratic.

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.580
So I hope for two cubic ones.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.170
And then I hope for
two fourth degree ones.

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.450
And that's the pattern,
that's the pattern.

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:41.180
Let me find-- let me
spot the cubic ones.

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.760
X cubed, if I start with x
cubed, of course the second x

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.320
derivative is probably 6x.

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:55.230
So I need the second y
derivative to be minus 6x.

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:01.780
And I think minus
3xy squared does it.

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.950
The second derivative
in y is 2 times

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.180
the minus 3x is
minus 6x, cancels

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:15.760
the 6x from the second
derivative there, and it works.

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.290
So that fits the pattern,
but what is the pattern?

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:21.020
Here it is.

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.700
It's fantastic.

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:35.060
I get these crazy polynomials
from taking x plus iy

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.740
to the different powers.

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:46.400
Here to the first power, if n
is 1, and I just have x plus iy

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.505
and I take the real
part, that's x.

00:03:48.505 --> 00:03:52.190
So I'll take the
real part of this.

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:56.810
The real part of this when
n is 1, the real part is x.

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.440
What about when n is 2?

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.390
Can you square
that in your head?

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:07.600
So we have x squared and we
have i squared y squared,

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.470
i squared being minus 1.

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:13.170
So I have x squared and
I have minus y squared.

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.149
Look, the real
part of this when n

00:04:17.149 --> 00:04:21.649
is 2, the real part
of x plus iy squared,

00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:24.820
the real part is x
squared minus y squared.

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:31.290
And the imaginary
part was the 2ixy.

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:36.720
So the imaginary part that
multiplies i is the 2xy.

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.250
This is our pattern when n is 2.

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:46.040
And when n is 3, I take
x plus iy cubed, and that

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.950
begins with x cubed like that.

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:51.910
And then I think that
the other real part

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:54.710
would be a minus 3xy squared.

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:56.870
I think you should check that.

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:59.970
And then there will
be an imaginary part.

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:03.890
Well, I think I could figure out
the imaginary part as I think.

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:13.540
Maybe something like
minus-- maybe it's

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:21.036
3yx squared minus y cubed,
something like that.

00:05:21.036 --> 00:05:22.910
That would be the real
part and that would be

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:25.130
the imaginary part when n is 3.

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:28.140
And wonderfully,
wonderfully, it works

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:34.280
for all powers, exponents n.

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:39.300
So I have now sort of a pretty
big family of solutions.

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:43.190
A list, a double list,
really, the real parts

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:45.910
and the imaginary
parts for every n.

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:53.300
So I can use those
to find the solution

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:58.570
u, which I'm looking for, the
temperature inside the circle.

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:03.860
Now of course, I have
a linear equation.

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:08.430
So if I have several
solutions, I can combine them

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:10.320
and I still have a solution.

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:13.330
X plus 7y will be a solution.

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:16.590
Plus 11x squared minus
y squared, no problem.

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:19.760
Plus 56 times 2xy.

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:21.410
Those are all solutions.

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:27.670
So I'm going to find a
solution, my final solution

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:31.694
u will be a combination of this,
this, this, this, this, this,

00:06:31.694 --> 00:06:35.520
this, and all the
others for higher n.

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.580
That's going to be my solution.

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:40.990
And I will need that
infinite family.

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:42.870
See, partial
differential equations,

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:48.390
we move up to infinite family
of solutions instead of just

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:51.580
a couple of null solutions.

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:53.810
So let me take an example.

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:54.785
Let me take an example.

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:03.320
We're taking the
region to be a circle.

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:16.050
So in that circle, I'm looking
for the solution u of x and y.

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:19.530
And actually in a circle,
it's pretty natural

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:22.140
to use polar coordinates.

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:27.210
Instead of x and y
inside a circle that's

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:31.680
inconvenient in the
xy plane, its equation

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:35.870
involves x equals square root of
1 minus y squared or something,

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:43.480
I'll switch to polar
coordinates r and theta.

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:47.090
Well, you might say
you remember we had

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:51.290
these nice family of solutions.

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:54.310
Is it still good in
polar coordinates?

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:56.980
Well the fact is,
it's even better.

00:07:56.980 --> 00:08:01.080
So the solution of u
will be the real part

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:03.040
and the imaginary part.

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:10.550
Now what is x plus
iy in r and theta?

00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:21.690
Well, we all know x is r Cos
theta plus ir sine theta.

00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:27.420
And that's r times Cos
theta plus i sine theta,

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:34.510
the one unforgettable
complex Euler's formula, e

00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:35.429
to the I theta.

00:08:39.429 --> 00:08:42.390
Now, I need its nth power.

00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:45.560
The nth power of
this is wonderful.

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:48.140
The real part and imaginary
part of the nth power

00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:53.320
is r to the nth e
to the in theta.

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:57.800
That's my x plus iy to the nth.

00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:00.510
Much nicer in polar
coordinates, because I

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:04.190
can take the real part and
the imaginary part right away.

00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:12.100
It's r to the nth Cos n theta
and r to the nth sine n theta.

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:17.690
These are my solutions,
my long list of solutions,

00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:20.100
to Laplace's equation.

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:23.630
And it's some
combination of those,

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:27.150
my final thing is going to
be some combination of those,

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:28.820
some combination.

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:31.730
Maybe coefficients a sub n.

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:41.820
I can use these and
I can use these.

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:49.550
So maybe b sub n r to
the nth sine n theta.

00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:52.780
You may wonder what I'm
doing, but what I'm achieved,

00:09:52.780 --> 00:10:00.540
it's done now, is to
find the general solution

00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:02.800
of Laplace's equation.

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:04.780
Instead of two
constants that we had

00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:09.180
for an ordinary differential
equation, a C1 and a C2,

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:14.740
here I have these guys
go from up to infinity.

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:16.470
N goes up to infinity.

00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:20.010
So I have many solutions.

00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:24.030
And any combination working,
so that's the general solution.

00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:25.790
That's the general solution.

00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:29.310
And I would have to
match that-- now here's

00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:33.020
the final step and not
simple, not always simple--

00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:36.590
I have to match this to
the boundary conditions.

00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:40.090
That's what will tell me
the constants, of course.

00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:45.790
As usual, c1 and c2 came from
the matching the conditions.

00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:50.140
Now I don't have just c1 and
c2, I have this infinite family

00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:53.560
of a's, infinite family of b's.

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:57.980
And I have a lot more to
match because on the boundary,

00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:04.810
here I have to match
u0, which is given.

00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:08.100
So I might be
given, suppose I was

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:13.370
given u0 equal to the
temperature was equal 1

00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:14.990
on the top half.

00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:20.410
And on the bottom half, say
the temperature is minus 1.

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:25.740
That's a typical problem.

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:28.720
I have a circular region.

00:11:31.810 --> 00:11:34.910
The top half is held
at one temperature,

00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:38.570
the lower half is held at
a different temperature.

00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:40.160
I reach equilibrium.

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:42.700
Everybody knows that
along that line,

00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:47.150
probably the temperature
would be 0 by symmetry.

00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:52.550
But once the temperature
there halfway up, not so easy,

00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:54.420
or anywhere in there.

00:11:54.420 --> 00:12:01.400
Well, the answer is u in
the middle, u of r and theta

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:08.350
inside is given by that formula.

00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:11.610
And again, the ANs
and the BNs come

00:12:11.610 --> 00:12:17.090
by matching the-- getting the
right answer on the boundary.

00:12:17.090 --> 00:12:24.430
Well, there's a big theory
there how do I match these?

00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:26.680
That's called a Fourier series.

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:28.670
That's called a Fourier series.

00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:33.080
So I'm finding the coefficients
for a Fourier series, the A's

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:39.040
and B's, that match a
function around the boundary.

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:42.150
And I could match any
function, and Fourier series

00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:47.230
is another entirely
separate video.

00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:52.830
We've done the job with
Laplace's equation in a circle.

00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:56.910
We've reduced the problem
to a Fourier series problem.

00:12:56.910 --> 00:13:00.290
We have found the
general solution.

00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:04.490
And then to match it to
a specific given boundary

00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:07.730
value, that's a
Fourier series problem.

00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:11.130
So I'll have to put that off
to the Fourier series video.

00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:12.840
Thank you.
