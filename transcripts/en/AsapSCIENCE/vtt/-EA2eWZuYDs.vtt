Whether you're cold, scared or listening to
some great music, you've likely

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.319
experienced goosebumps at some point in
your life.  But have you ever wondered why

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.700
this strange change takes over your
body?  Named after the way poultry looks

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.839
when plucked, goosebumps are a fairly useless trait in humans which have been passed

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.180
on by our ancestors.  Each hair actually
has a tiny muscle attached to it called

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.939
the erector-pili muscles and when these
muscles contract the hair stands up on

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.990
end.  This contraction creates a shallow
depression around the hair causing the

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.840
surrounding area to protrude.  And it's
the stress hormone adrenaline which

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.830
triggers this physiological change to
occur.  So what triggers adrenaline?  For

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:39.710
one being cold, in animals with much more
hair on their body this response helps

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.830
them to stay warm.  The standing hair is
able to trap more air and thermal

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.580
regulate it ultimately providing an
insulated barrier.  Apart from this

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.800
adrenaline is also triggered under
stressful situations leading to the

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.850
"fight or flight" response, like when
you're scared.  Cats are a perfect example,

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.540
if you give them a spook their hair
shoots up on end.

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.520
This involuntary evolutionary response
allows animals to appear bigger and

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.900
more intimidating.  But why music has the
ability to cause chills or "frisson" as

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.560
it's called is not fully understood.  One
interesting theory suggests that

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.840
elements of music such as sudden volume
changes or unexpected unique sections

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.880
induce a sub-conscious fear response.  The
body loves predictability and so

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.920
anything surprising to the autonomic
system stimulates an alarm.  But this fear

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.440
quickly subsides as our brain realizes,
"hey, it's just music".  And this contrast in

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.400
experience causes the frisson
and your goosebumps.  There are other

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.630
theories as well, ultimately the brain
is extremely complex and so a relationship

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.440
between music, emotion and physiological
responses is difficult to decipher but

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.110
in science it's okay to say that we
don't know...yet.
