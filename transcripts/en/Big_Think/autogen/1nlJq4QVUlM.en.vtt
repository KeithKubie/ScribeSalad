computer power measured in various ways
increases exponentially and it's

doubling time is something like 18

months there's another law which I've

coined Hodgkin law which says that

genomes increases exponentially and the

that it's such it's more like 27 months

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:57.590
that it's such it's more like 27 months

that it's such it's more like 27 months
but Hodgkin law and Moore's law are

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710
but Hodgkin law and Moore's law are
 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.899
but Hodgkin law and Moore's law are
related because genetic sequencing is

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:04.909
related because genetic sequencing is
 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:08.109

the increase in in the part of sequence
 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.700
the increase in in the part of sequence
genomes has been the increase in
