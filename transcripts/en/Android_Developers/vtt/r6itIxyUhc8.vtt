00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.660
Despite the fact that Camera360 has been around for 8 years

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.500
the passion to create better photographic experience using new technologies

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.680
has always been strong since day one

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.240
Hello everyone, I’m Hao Xu

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.120
founder &amp; CEO of Camera360

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.960
The passion towards photography actually came from my father

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.380
Since he is a photographer himself

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.160
he gave me some of my earliest encounters and influence on photography

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.100
After growing up

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.940
I also wanted more people to experience the beauty of photography

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:33.140
Using technology and innovation

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.700
to bring powerful, flexible shooting experiences to the audience

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.140
Up to this day, mobile devices have become more and more diverse

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.140
in order to satisfy users

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.080
and to inspire their creative appetite

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.780
a more open platform and more advanced technologies are a necessity

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.760
Hello, I’m Tao Li, technical lead of Camera360

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.460
We began paying attention to Kotlin programming language years ago

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.440
As soon as it became an official language for Android development

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.460
we decided to popularize Kotlin use within our company

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.140
Ever since dipping our toes into Kotlin through StudyJams

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.880
to company-wide study sessions that happen twice a week

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.760
our engineers showed lots of passion towards the language

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.020
It has to do with the fact that Kotlin has a relatively reasonable learning curve

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.780
and many highly efficient syntactic features

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.040
A great deal of syntactic sugar, with different modern programming language features

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.260
like native lambda expression

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.280
makes Kotlin a great tool to dramatically boost our development efficiency

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.780
For example, the brand new modules we developed using Kotlin

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.920
only took three months to be production-ready

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.980
Refactoring existing code with Kotlin also proved to be quite beneficial

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:34.980
What used to be 200 lines of Java code

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.580
became 86 lines after using Kotlin

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.820
As for stability, we compared a project mostly written in Java language

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.220
with another primarily consists of Kotlin code

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.260
we found the latter demonstrates reduced NullPointerExceptions notably

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.680
I'm Rui Gu, co-founder &amp; COO of Camera360

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.520
Using new technologies to improve and polish user experience is also essential

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.680
We used Android vitals to decrease excessive wakeups

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.100
from 4.51% to 0.01%

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.340
crash rate decreased from 0.99% to 0.27%

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.900
This resulted in our monthly rating increase from 4.341 to 4.471

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:13.800
After releasing the innovative animated sticker feature

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.800
we became the most popular camera app in Japan

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.080
Now we are more than confident to use new technology in our product

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.960
such as Google ARCore, to further enhance our use experience

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.960
and achieve better photographic results

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.240
Actively utilizing new technology asap

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.020
as well as investment in independent R&amp;D

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.700
made it possible for Camera360 to stay well received over a long period of time in the global market

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.700
We believe we would be able to

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.960
reach more and more global audience on Google Play

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.720
and create more smiles and happiness in return by bringing our products to them
