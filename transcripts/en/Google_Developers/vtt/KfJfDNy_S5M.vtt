00:00:01.119 --> 00:00:01.910
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Hi.

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:05.730
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.360
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Hi, I'm Jake
Archibald, and I love the web.

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.920
It's the safest
platform in the world,

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.980
and there's absolutely
no barrier to entry.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.940
You just visit a URL
and you get content.

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:18.880
So let's have a discussion
on how we might screw that

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.720
all up with installable
apps and missions.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.520
First introduced this subject,
it Mozilla's very own, Marcos

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.260
Caceres.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.072
So do you want to get your
laptop plugged in and start--

00:00:31.072 --> 00:00:32.030
MARCOS CACERES: I'm up?

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.980
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
--making words happen.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:33.952
Go for it.

00:00:33.952 --> 00:00:35.035
MARCOS CACERES: All right.

00:00:35.035 --> 00:00:35.920
Fantastic.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.495
So thanks very much
for the [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:40.495 --> 00:00:43.010
I'm not going to talk about me.

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.310
But I work for Mozilla
and I'm extremely

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:47.310
interested in this area.

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:49.630
I've been looking at it
for a very, very long time.

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:58.050
Installable web apps and
permissions-- the problem first

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.937
up is that these are
very related topics

00:01:00.937 --> 00:01:02.520
but they're actually
different topics.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.170
So I actually want to talk
about them separately.

00:01:08.517 --> 00:01:10.850
When we think about permissions
and with the discussions

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.000
that we've been having within
the community, to some degree

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.830
we're talking about this right?

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.930
Is this actually
just a straw man?

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:22.756
Or is this actually
a real problem?

00:01:22.756 --> 00:01:23.880
Is this actually happening?

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.963
Is this something people
are experiencing and why?

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.022
So I'm just going to rush.

00:01:31.022 --> 00:01:32.480
I only have 10
minutes so I'm going

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.850
to rush through all this stuff.

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.260
We do have models on the
web for when we introduce

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:42.140
new APIs about how
we make a decision,

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.790
whether we want an API or not.

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.771
So Adrian [INAUDIBLE]
has a nice diagram.

00:01:46.771 --> 00:01:49.020
I'm sorry it's going to be
extremely difficult for you

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.120
guys to read it, if you
want to see it online.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.070
But it essentially has
very simple decisions

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:59.200
where you can say, for instance,
can the action be undone?

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.880
Can the action be undone with
minimal effort, yes or no?

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.339
If it's yes, then
automatic grant.

00:02:05.339 --> 00:02:06.880
If it's now, you
ask another question

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.440
about the severity and so on.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.937
And from that you can
basically create an API

00:02:10.937 --> 00:02:13.520
and decide on their permission
level that you want to give it.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:14.720
Then we have a
different model which

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.300
is, for instance, with service
workers and request total

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.995
complete, where--
don't get excited.

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.970
And that model is like--
you have an SSL certificate,

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.570
and if you do then you
can access this API.

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:32.150
So I'm not saying these are
good things or bad things?

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:33.230
Do we need these things?

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:34.970
Is this enough?

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.840
So this is for the panel.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.060
Is that what we need?

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.010
Why are we getting stuck?

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.530
We know-- you know, for
instance, for geolocation,

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.486
we're kind of stuck
because we can't really no

00:02:47.486 --> 00:02:49.610
if the permission's been
granted before we actually

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:50.420
make the request.

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:51.784
And that's screwing us.

00:02:51.784 --> 00:02:53.200
Like when we try
to develop sites,

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.290
that's screwing us,
because we don't

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:55.456
know what's happening there.

00:02:55.456 --> 00:02:57.770
So we need to fix
those kinds of things.

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:04.020
So it's 2014, where are my apps?

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:05.099
Why can't I install yet?

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:06.140
What the hell's going on?

00:03:09.157 --> 00:03:11.240
It's interesting-- the
problem is of installation,

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.780
because it's not
just like, can we

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.070
add the apps to the home screen.

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:18.620
In the sidelines,
those are going on.

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.661
You know there's this
whole package apps movement

00:03:20.661 --> 00:03:21.940
and also there's hybrid apps.

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.450
So let's start with
web apps, very quickly.

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.520
Are we installable yet?

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.920
Do we have the right bits
that we actually need?

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.660
So I'm treating model
view controllers

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.560
as HTML, CSS, and
JavaScript as the kind

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.860
of embodiment all
these concepts.

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.790
Are we there with that stuff?

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:43.700
Kind of.

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.470
If I had to give a rating to
this I would maybe give it,

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.200
like, a C plus.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.850
We can do a lot of really
cool stuff on the web

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:52.840
but some stuff is
really challenging.

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.490
You're going to hear more of
this throughout this today.

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:58.610
We don't have a really
good design language yet

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.080
to express apps on the web.

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.430
Giving apps a name--
a very simple thing.

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.090
That's not really
well supported.

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.760
So we have title elements but we
don't really have a short name,

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.540
like you do in iOS.

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.040
Icons is just really bad
on the web right now.

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.079
We need to really work on icons.

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:21.450
Display modes-- full
screen, fantastic.

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:24.120
Are there other
display modes than we

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.630
should be looking at
for installable apps?

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.990
Orientation is really
bad at the moment.

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:31.540
We're working on fixing that.

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.700
We don't really have control
orientation right now

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.590
to lock orientation.

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:38.477
Offline-- we've all heard
Jake, blab, blab, blab.

00:04:38.477 --> 00:04:39.560
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Well done.

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.140
MARCOS CACERES: Yeah, well done.

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:43.910
But today, man, it's bad.

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:45.870
You know?

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.880
I would give it a D
or an F, you know?

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:49.980
A start page for an app.

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:51.440
The place that you first go.

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:52.910
We don't have that concept.

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:55.900
So you go to a page,
you go to an app.

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.400
You leave, you come back, and
you're like at the same place.

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:59.983
That might be good,
that might be bad.

00:04:59.983 --> 00:05:01.620
When you install
an app, usually you

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.872
want a place to go
where you start from.

00:05:04.872 --> 00:05:06.330
So I'm really trying
to rush these.

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.990
Navigational
boundaries-- so when

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:10.630
you install an app
like a native app,

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:12.672
it has a starting point
and an ending point.

00:05:12.672 --> 00:05:14.880
And you know when you jump
from one app to the other.

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.230
On the web, there
isn't that concept.

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:17.813
We don't have a
concept of boundaries.

00:05:17.813 --> 00:05:21.420
You follow links, and if
those links look the same,

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:23.920
essentially in the same app--
you can be at Google.com

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.432
and bounce from one
app to the other

00:05:25.432 --> 00:05:27.140
and you wouldn't even
know where you are.

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:31.100
So the only cues that
we have are visual cues.

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:34.180
In native apps you actually
have actual boundaries.

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:38.410
They'll call them physical
boundaries that prevent you

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:41.810
from going from one
place to another.

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:44.220
And the visual cues
are very evident.

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:46.932
And they're not
there on the web,

00:05:46.932 --> 00:05:48.390
or at least in the
installable web,

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:52.720
particularly people who've
tried to build for iOS.

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.590
You've probably seen that.

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:56.590
If you try to navigate,
it stops for navigating,

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:00.340
so you have to hijack
navigation and so on.

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:03.320
So I've talking five minutes.

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:07.990
Capabilities-- an
integration into the system.

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:14.520
Device APIs-- can web apps use,
let's say, iOS's health kit?

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:17.004
What about all the fip
bits and things that?

00:06:17.004 --> 00:06:17.670
What's going on?

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:19.150
Why can't we do that?

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:20.790
How do we get there?

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:23.750
And that integration
into the OS, into to task

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:26.130
switch and so on.

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:28.660
Again I'm going to call out iOS.

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:30.720
You've seen that it
doesn't really work.

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:34.760
Like, if you're at the home
screen, a website on iOS,

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:37.030
and you double-tap,
the screen goes black.

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:40.470
It doesn't remember
anything if you leave.

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:42.970
But at the same time they've
done really nice work.

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:45.050
So if you like
enable geolocation

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:50.430
it will actually be
in the privacy section

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:52.400
with all the other apps,
which is kind of cool.

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:54.420
So there's potential there.

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:00.450
Meanwhile, single page
apps, we've all seen 'em.

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:08.800
They were introduced
in iOS back in 2009.

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:11.050
I did a little study
of what's going.

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:14.170
I looked at the
top 78,000 sites.

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:18.030
I found 1,000, nearly
1,100 that were

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:21.080
claiming to be installable apps.

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:23.490
What I actually found was
that 90% of those apps cannot

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:25.040
actually be used as standalone.

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:28.860
This also in October
of last year.

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:33.170
Of the 10% that we're actually
usable, as installable apps,

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:36.000
28% had significant limitations
that didn't actually

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.020
allow to use those apps.

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:39.930
85% of the sites
relied on hyperlinks,

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:43.100
which meant that the whole
process of installing the app

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:46.810
was basically just facade.

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:48.310
I won't go through
the other details

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:50.220
but the story is kind of bad.

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:51.810
We need to really fix this.

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:53.380
Meanwhile we have packaged apps.

00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:55.610
You know, they solve
offline for us.

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:58.470
Firefox OS is using
them extensively,

00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:01.210
but they lead to proprietary
app stores, which is not great,

00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:01.970
doesn't scale.

00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:03.450
It's not really web friendly.

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:05.332
And it forces
centralized control

00:08:05.332 --> 00:08:07.540
because you need to have a
digital signature in order

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:08.900
to these things.

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:11.440
Again, not great.

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:13.420
But it's not the
web, as people say,

00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:15.600
because you cannot really
link to them either.

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:17.210
So we should really
talk about that.

00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:20.920
And then we have the hybrid app.

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:23.884
So the hybrid app is
an interesting beast.

00:08:23.884 --> 00:08:24.884
BRIAN LEROUX: Seriously?

00:08:32.799 --> 00:08:35.873
MARCOS CACERES: I actually
wanted to find a beautiful--

00:08:35.873 --> 00:08:36.789
because a hybrid app--

00:08:36.789 --> 00:08:37.914
JAKE ARCHIBALD: You failed.

00:08:37.914 --> 00:08:39.101
MARCOS CACERES: I did.

00:08:39.101 --> 00:08:40.559
I wanted to introduce
it with that,

00:08:40.559 --> 00:08:44.560
but-- you know, the hybrid app--
I find it really interesting.

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:46.330
And particularly in iOS8.

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:50.400
Again, you know, I'm a
little bit obsessed with iOS

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:52.420
because they've made
it really, really

00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:56.260
easy to take a web
view, like with Swift,

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:59.670
and you can just embed it,
and you can inject JavaScript.

00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:02.042
You can write your
own APIs that talk

00:09:02.042 --> 00:09:03.500
through a very
simple communication

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:10.630
channel between Swift or
Objective C and JavaScript.

00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:15.300
This is like, for me, this
is like super, crazy cool.

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:17.900
And PhoneGaps has been
doing this for ages.

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:20.020
You guys have worked
this out ages ago.

00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:24.030
But the interesting thing
is-- so you get this deep OS

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:26.140
integration in clearing
the permissioning,

00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:28.870
but you also get this
ability to, like-- you know,

00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:33.170
forget Windows, I'm just going
to focus on whatever system.

00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:35.050
And I'm just going to
build plugins for that.

00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:40.400
And this pluggable model that
leverages the web and the OS?

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:43.080
I think that battle
is going to heat up.

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:47.380
And I think if it's
only going to be closed,

00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:50.190
proprietary platforms, they're
going to have a problem.

00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:55.000
So discuss, basically.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.210
That's like, in 10
minutes, the world.

00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:00.710
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
Thank you very much.

00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:01.835
MARCOS CACERES: No problem.

00:10:01.835 --> 00:10:04.820
JAKE ARCHIBALD: OK, so to
field questions on that subject

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:08.010
we have Marcos who you've
already met from Mozilla.

00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:10.020
We also have Eli
Fidler, who works

00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:12.790
on the browser and we
platform for BlackBerry.

00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:15.720
We have Matt Andrews, who's done
work with the FT and Economist

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:18.720
web apps, and has done lots
of exciting stuff with offline

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:19.610
first, on the web.

00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:21.000
We've got Chris Wilson.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.340
One of my colleagues at Chrome.

00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:25.820
Do think it's fair to say
we're Chromatically involved?

00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:26.820
CHRIS WILSON: Of course.

00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:29.110
As long as you're comfortable
letting people know that.

00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:30.568
JAKE ARCHIBALD: So
Chris is working

00:10:30.568 --> 00:10:32.740
on making the a
first class platform.

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:35.930
And Brian Leroux, a
pioneer in dragging the web

00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:40.050
onto the mobile world via
PhoneGap here at Adobe.

00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:42.580
So please do be part
of the discussion.

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:44.654
Please jump in using On Slide.

00:10:44.654 --> 00:10:46.320
It doesn't have to
be a question either.

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:48.350
You could be making a statement.

00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:50.820
Yeah, please, be part
of the discussion.

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:53.980
So, OK, panel, get
yourselves into the

00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:56.930
receive position for
the first question which

00:10:56.930 --> 00:11:01.580
comes from Sara F. And so
I'll paraphrase it here.

00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:04.210
Recently the Verge announced
that they are discontinuing

00:11:04.210 --> 00:11:06.630
their device specific
apps in favor

00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:08.690
of a truly responsive site.

00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:11.370
Is that trend we should
expect to continue,

00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:13.610
and why isn't every
app doing this?

00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:16.690
So, Matt, you've done
stuff on the web.

00:11:16.690 --> 00:11:18.180
And it works, right?

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:19.158
So we've won?

00:11:19.158 --> 00:11:19.658
Yeah?

00:11:19.658 --> 00:11:21.610
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:21.610 --> 00:11:23.840
MATT ANDREWS: I wish
it was that simple.

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:25.082
I hope that continues.

00:11:25.082 --> 00:11:26.040
That's what we've done.

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:30.190
That's what the Economist
is also moving towards.

00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:31.440
Yeah.

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:35.070
I think there's still, as Marcos
showed, huge holes in the web

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:37.930
platform that make that
very difficult right now.

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:40.480
JAKE ARCHIBALD: So what
troubles did you have?

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:42.970
MATT ANDREWS: I think the
offline, F minus, or whatever

00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:46.660
that got, is probably the
biggest problem, at least

00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:47.260
for us.

00:11:51.796 --> 00:11:53.420
JAKE ARCHIBALD: So
Brain you've kind of

00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:57.301
straddled both worlds
of web and native.

00:11:57.301 --> 00:11:58.990
Do we even still
have to do that?

00:11:58.990 --> 00:11:59.770
It's done, right?

00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:03.080
BRIAN LEROUX: I wish it was.

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:05.034
I think it depends
on your app content

00:12:05.034 --> 00:12:06.450
and what you're
trying to do, what

00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:08.241
you're trying to achieve
with that content.

00:12:08.241 --> 00:12:10.500
If you've got something
that's more text heavy

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:13.320
and needs to be updated
frequently then responsive

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:14.600
websites make a lot of sense.

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:16.308
As soon as you start
having interactivity

00:12:16.308 --> 00:12:18.710
that involves the
sensors of the phone,

00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:20.040
the web's kind of a ghetto.

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:22.570
And then if you need
that thing to be offline,

00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:24.442
you well know that
that can be difficult.

00:12:24.442 --> 00:12:25.900
The trick is,
though, people always

00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:27.250
say that native's
better at offline.

00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:28.333
I don't think that's true.

00:12:28.333 --> 00:12:31.760
Like this morning I was trying
to get into Uber and I'm with

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:33.640
T-Mobile so I couldn't.

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:37.122
Because effectively I was
offline even I said it was on.

00:12:37.122 --> 00:12:38.026
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:38.026 --> 00:12:40.790
And Uber works really poorly
when you're not online.

00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:42.440
And that's the case
with a lot of apps.

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:45.160
So I don't know that offline
is actually a native advantage,

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:46.790
it's just a programming style.

00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:49.345
And the web style just
happens to be really hostile.

00:12:49.345 --> 00:12:51.470
JAKE ARCHIBALD: And working
with the offline stuff,

00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:53.955
I find that it's only the
very best of native apps

00:12:53.955 --> 00:12:56.676
that seem to do this stuff
well, very few of them.

00:12:56.676 --> 00:12:58.300
So what kind of stuff
do you see people

00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:01.462
using PhoneGap for today?

00:13:01.462 --> 00:13:03.420
BRIAN LEROUX: They us if
for all kinds of stuff

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:04.900
they probably
shouldn't use it for.

00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:06.275
And they use it
for stuff that we

00:13:06.275 --> 00:13:07.800
don't expect them to use it for.

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:11.860
The big trend lately for us
has been in the enterprise.

00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:14.500
A lot of business apps
are being built now.

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:17.690
The larger corporations
that are out there invested

00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:19.600
all this money and all
this infrastructure

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:21.420
in the web and then
suddenly everyone's

00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:22.810
showing up with iPhones.

00:13:22.810 --> 00:13:26.080
And they've got a whole bunch
of Java programmers in the back

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:28.330
there, slaving away
on SQL and they

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:31.220
don't want to learn Objective
C. And they see Swift,

00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:33.810
and they're like, OK, maybe
that's going to be OK.

00:13:33.810 --> 00:13:37.860
Except for, it only works on
iOS8 and it won't work on iOS9.

00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:39.584
So Swift is probably
not something

00:13:39.584 --> 00:13:41.500
you want to invest in
if you're an enterprise.

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:43.950
So they're looking to the
web technologies as a way

00:13:43.950 --> 00:13:44.800
to solve this.

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:49.094
So that seems to be the place
that we're the most popularity.

00:13:49.094 --> 00:13:51.510
JAKE ARCHIBALD: You're doing
similar things on BlackBerry,

00:13:51.510 --> 00:13:55.830
taking the web stuff and
app-ifying onto that platform.

00:13:55.830 --> 00:13:57.782
Are you seeing the
same kind of trends?

00:13:57.782 --> 00:13:58.740
ELI FIDLER: Absolutely.

00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:00.950
I mean, we have our
WebWorks platform,

00:14:00.950 --> 00:14:04.205
which is essentially a
wrapper around Cordova.

00:14:04.205 --> 00:14:08.840
And a huge, huge number of apps
for all BlackBerry platforms

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:11.050
are written using
this technology.

00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:13.930
I think it's compelling
for application developers

00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:16.190
because lots of people
have web skills.

00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:20.340
And you can argue semantics
about what is the web,

00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:22.790
and how is an app the
web or not the web.

00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:26.900
But even if it's not
online in a browser,

00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:29.290
people know HTML and
JavaScript and CSS,

00:14:29.290 --> 00:14:31.102
and those technologies,
independent

00:14:31.102 --> 00:14:32.810
of a lot of the other
problems that we've

00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:35.450
talked about have won
in a lot of cases.

00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:40.110
Even apps that we consider
native often have,

00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:43.040
most of the app, or at least
a huge percentage of the app

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:44.000
is a web view.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.041
BRIAN LEROUX: App stores.

00:14:46.954 --> 00:14:49.370
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Is that why--
because you mentioned before

00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:53.910
that people are building
PhoneGap style things for stuff

00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:56.200
they probably shouldn't.

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:57.190
Is app stores why?

00:14:57.190 --> 00:14:58.393
BRIAN LEROUX: I shouldn't
of said that, but--

00:14:58.393 --> 00:14:59.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:00.610
I can't that one back now.

00:15:00.610 --> 00:15:03.540
So like, for example, one of
the big ones we see is games.

00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:05.800
We see a lot of people
building games using web tech.

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:08.258
And I guess when you're a young
programmer, when you're new

00:15:08.258 --> 00:15:10.412
or you're amateur and you
want to get into software

00:15:10.412 --> 00:15:12.870
development, one of the things
that becomes really exciting

00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:13.690
is games.

00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:16.640
And so we've been
saying for years,

00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:19.390
don't build a game on PhoneGap,
that's a terrible idea.

00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:22.470
You need delay, and have high
intensive graphics and stuff.

00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:24.570
But it terms in mobile
that you don't actually

00:15:24.570 --> 00:15:26.870
need high intensive
graphics and stuff.

00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:30.120
Like Sudoku type games,
like little card games,

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:31.620
really simple 2D platformers.

00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:34.161
And for that type of thing the
web is actually really good at

00:15:34.161 --> 00:15:35.190
and it's getting better.

00:15:35.190 --> 00:15:36.790
So that's the type of
thing where we're like,

00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:37.956
don't use PhoneGap for that.

00:15:37.956 --> 00:15:40.332
But people do anyways.

00:15:40.332 --> 00:15:41.790
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
Dominic [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:44.110
has a point about that?

00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:46.050
DOMINIC: Yeah, I
guess I'm just not

00:15:46.050 --> 00:15:48.580
as interested in
using HTML and CSS,

00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:50.419
and so on, just as a
programming language.

00:15:50.419 --> 00:15:51.710
There's all these technologies.

00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:54.380
You can use C Sharp and you
can use all these things

00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:56.580
that compile to whatever's
native on the platform

00:15:56.580 --> 00:15:57.960
or get baked in.

00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:00.160
What I'm most interested
in is how do we get it

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:01.750
so I don't have to
go through Apple

00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:04.125
and submit to their app store
and go through their review

00:16:04.125 --> 00:16:05.511
process?

00:16:05.511 --> 00:16:07.760
Because I don't want to just
use the web technologies,

00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:09.510
I want to get all the
benefits of the web.

00:16:11.915 --> 00:16:14.040
BRIAN LEROUX: There's an
answer that I can give you

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:15.590
when I'm not being recorded.

00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:17.807
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:17.807 --> 00:16:19.640
MATT ANDREWS: So right
now, your only choice

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:20.973
is to add to home screen, right?

00:16:20.973 --> 00:16:24.230
You can build a single page app
or even a not to single page

00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:27.680
app if you had hijacking
links and doing

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:29.970
horrible things like that.

00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:33.020
And that's your only choice.

00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:35.510
I think the spec,
the manifest spec

00:16:35.510 --> 00:16:37.080
will hopefully improve that.

00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:42.940
MARCOS CACERES: So
yeah, the manifest spec

00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:44.810
is attempting to address that.

00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:47.380
So it's trying to-- those
things that I mentioned before,

00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:49.390
that list of things
that we need-- it's

00:16:49.390 --> 00:16:52.000
trying to address those things.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.030
But again, it requires
everybody to get on board.

00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:57.450
If we can't get all the
browser vendors on board,

00:16:57.450 --> 00:16:59.004
then it's like--

00:16:59.004 --> 00:17:00.670
JAKE ARCHIBALD: So
who is on board then?

00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:03.151
Chrome, Opera, Mozilla?

00:17:03.151 --> 00:17:04.650
MARCOS CACERES:
Opera not explicitly

00:17:04.650 --> 00:17:08.849
but they may get it
straight from Blink.

00:17:08.849 --> 00:17:09.970
Who knows about Apple.

00:17:09.970 --> 00:17:12.530
Microsoft has kind of said,
yeah, we're kind of interested.

00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:13.446
It looks kind of cool.

00:17:13.446 --> 00:17:15.291
But they haven't
committed to anything.

00:17:15.291 --> 00:17:17.040
JAKE ARCHIBALD: So can
we get a microphone

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:18.119
to-- Matthew
Hoffman, do you want

00:17:18.119 --> 00:17:19.702
to raise your hand
where ever you are.

00:17:19.702 --> 00:17:20.630
You're over there.

00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:24.010
And Andrew, I don't have a
screen with that on here.

00:17:24.010 --> 00:17:27.060
So it's kind of difficult for
me to see who's in the queue.

00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:28.530
I don't know if that solvable.

00:17:28.530 --> 00:17:30.172
If not, don't worry about it.

00:17:30.172 --> 00:17:32.630
MATTHEW HOFFMAN: So I think
one of the problems of web apps

00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:37.240
on mobile is that they cannot
actually integrate fully with

00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:43.610
the native UI that the
mobile platforms provide.

00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:47.150
So it's two islands really, and
you can call in some features,

00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:49.850
but you cannot show anything
coming from native inside

00:17:49.850 --> 00:17:50.800
your web app island.

00:17:53.315 --> 00:17:54.690
MARCOS CACERES:
What do you mean?

00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:54.850
Sorry.

00:17:54.850 --> 00:17:56.141
What do you mean in particular?

00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:04.290
MATTHEW HOFFMAN: Any contents.

00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:06.185
For example, video
produced from native.

00:18:06.185 --> 00:18:09.620
And possibly if you have UI
elements that you want to make

00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:14.620
your web app feel more native,
you cannot do that either.

00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:19.050
So you can leverage
sensors and all that,

00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:23.250
but you cannot build something
that looks and feels native

00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:25.680
in the web.

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:27.890
MARCOS CACERES: So can
I bounce to Brian here.

00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:32.140
Because for PhoneGap, you're
targeting cross platform.

00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:36.200
And I would have imagined
that if you're actually

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:38.400
building an app you want
it to have, more or less,

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:40.390
its own look and feel.

00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:42.830
Of course leverage what
you can from the OS,

00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:43.804
but across the board?

00:18:43.804 --> 00:18:45.220
BRIAN LEROUX: The
first six months

00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:48.870
of PhoneGap's life we definitely
experimented with plug-ins,

00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:51.690
which would abstract
out user interfaces.

00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:54.750
So that you could do things
like invoke a tab bar.

00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:56.980
Those metaphors
got really leaky.

00:18:56.980 --> 00:18:58.332
And they broke down super fast.

00:18:58.332 --> 00:19:00.040
And you probably have
seen that if you've

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:02.070
used any kind of
compiled to solutions.

00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:05.710
So a tab bar on iOS isn't the
same as a tab bar on Android.

00:19:05.710 --> 00:19:07.850
[INAUDIBLE] on iOS is
usually on the bottom.

00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:11.280
And sometimes the iOS one
has bevels and embosses.

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:12.950
Not anymore but it used to.

00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:15.140
And so then you'd end up
having to kind of reinvent

00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:17.170
CSS for this damn
tab bar and you

00:19:17.170 --> 00:19:20.090
don't want to do that either
because there's already CSS.

00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:22.920
And so the web
has sort of shown,

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:25.800
and there's lots of
projects out that

00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:28.290
demonstrate that you can
build native like interfaces.

00:19:28.290 --> 00:19:30.840
And I say native-like, I
won't say a native interfaces.

00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:34.910
So like Ionic, Polymer
with material design

00:19:34.910 --> 00:19:37.240
is actually looking
really good on Android.

00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:40.780
Maybe not so much on iOS8 yet,
but soon it will, I'm sure.

00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:45.500
So I don't think it's
actually worth pursuing.

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:47.730
We could waste our
time trying to paint

00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:51.620
over Android's UI and
iOS' UI and create

00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:54.500
some kind of universal UI
that everybody opts into it

00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:55.960
and loves and it native.

00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:57.661
Or we can just do
the stuff ourselves

00:19:57.661 --> 00:19:58.660
with the web primitives.

00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:02.277
And I think the extensible web
manifesto type discussion later

00:20:02.277 --> 00:20:03.610
will touch into that a lot more.

00:20:03.610 --> 00:20:05.895
We need these lower
level paint kind ideas

00:20:05.895 --> 00:20:08.265
so that we can build these
properties and interfaces.

00:20:08.265 --> 00:20:10.890
I think native
interfaces themselves,

00:20:10.890 --> 00:20:12.667
the abstractions
are just too leaky.

00:20:12.667 --> 00:20:15.250
If you want to build an iOS app
and have it be native, pick up

00:20:15.250 --> 00:20:17.340
a book on Objective C.

00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:19.923
JAKE ARCHIBALD: I know some of
the custom layout stuff, that's

00:20:19.923 --> 00:20:22.180
going to come up in the
[INAUDIBLE] panel as well.

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:24.040
Can we get Dominic a
microphone and we'll

00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:25.695
wrap up this question?

00:20:25.695 --> 00:20:28.070
DOMINIC: Yeah I just wanted
to share an interesting point

00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:31.240
that we ran into on
the Polymer team.

00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:35.020
When the material
design stuff came out,

00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:37.180
we were seeing articles
where it's like,

00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:40.400
is the paper element,
the custom element close

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:41.760
to the Android version?

00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:44.070
As if the Android
version was canonical.

00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:45.590
But really, the
team was asking, why

00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:47.840
does everybody think the
Android version is canonical?

00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:49.215
It might as well
just be the case

00:20:49.215 --> 00:20:52.010
that the version we're putting
out for the web is canonical

00:20:52.010 --> 00:20:53.510
and you should be
comparing to that.

00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:56.650
So I kind of agree that
maybe it doesn't matter,

00:20:56.650 --> 00:21:00.004
but also, it's like, the web
is a first class programming

00:21:00.004 --> 00:21:01.420
platform for all
these things too,

00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:03.194
so I thought that
was interesting.

00:21:03.194 --> 00:21:04.610
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
That kind of leads

00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:06.200
nicely into the next question.

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:08.170
Or certainly in
terms of maybe not

00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:10.190
taking Android's lead on things.

00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:11.930
So this question's
from Andrew Betts,

00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:13.600
I don't you've heard of him.

00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:17.450
He says, "the web model of
granular on-demand user consent

00:21:17.450 --> 00:21:20.520
is the only sensible way
of doing app permissions.

00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:22.380
Why do app packaging
systems rush

00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:25.120
to destroy that model
in favor of the broken

00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:26.527
up front permissions list?

00:21:26.527 --> 00:21:28.110
And I have a lot of
sympathy for this,

00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:30.180
because I know in the
Chrome web install,

00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:32.320
when TweetDeck's
there and there were

00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:34.490
a series of user
reviews saying, I

00:21:34.490 --> 00:21:37.030
don't trust this because
when I go to install it,

00:21:37.030 --> 00:21:41.220
it asks to be able to
tweet on my behalf.

00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:42.410
I don't want it to do that.

00:21:42.410 --> 00:21:43.250
That sounds crazy.

00:21:43.250 --> 00:21:44.708
But people didn't
realize that when

00:21:44.708 --> 00:21:47.300
you type in a box on
TweetDeck and you hit tweet,

00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:49.920
TweetDeck is tweeting on your
behalf, that's what it's doing.

00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:52.560
And it asks for permission at
that point it would make sense.

00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:55.816
So Chris, Google uses
this up front model

00:21:55.816 --> 00:21:56.940
for Chrome apps in Android.

00:21:56.940 --> 00:21:58.990
Why do we keep getting it wrong?

00:21:58.990 --> 00:22:02.350
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:05.370
CHRIS WILSON: I think that
was a decision you made.

00:22:05.370 --> 00:22:09.230
No, I mean, I think the reason
why we keep doing this--

00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:12.000
and I won't say it's
wrong, necessarily.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.140
The reason why we keep doing
is it's seductively easy.

00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:18.000
You just pop something
up-- yeah 90% of the users

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.740
may not actually read it.

00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:24.220
99.999% of the users may not
read it, but they click OK.

00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:25.990
And then from the
app's perspective

00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:28.320
they get to do whatever
they needed to do.

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:29.800
They get to do
whatever they want.

00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:31.210
This is not really good.

00:22:31.210 --> 00:22:33.570
I'm not saying this is
the right thing to do.

00:22:33.570 --> 00:22:35.990
But I think that we are
trying to do this better.

00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:40.800
The flow chart that Marcos
put up on the screen earlier

00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:43.290
is a smarter way of thinking
about how you should

00:22:43.290 --> 00:22:44.940
be doing some of
these permissions.

00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:49.560
And I think for web applications
we will have to do much better.

00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:52.690
Because I started reading
some of those things

00:22:52.690 --> 00:22:56.260
on my native apps and I stopped
installing a bunch of apps,

00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:58.530
because they wanted
to do crazy stuff.

00:22:58.530 --> 00:23:02.040
And particularly
on iOS, you know,

00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:04.670
they started separating
these out where you can,

00:23:04.670 --> 00:23:06.870
not get notifications,
for example.

00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:10.420
And while the little
notifications-- I am just

00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:13.390
obsessive enough with the
little numbers on every icon

00:23:13.390 --> 00:23:14.540
drive me batty.

00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:17.309
Like I can't stand
having numbers popping up

00:23:17.309 --> 00:23:17.850
all the time.

00:23:17.850 --> 00:23:20.620
So I just disable every
application, even the ones

00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:22.810
that I might care
about because of that.

00:23:22.810 --> 00:23:23.350
JAKE ARCHIBALD: And we do.

00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:24.320
Google Plus as well, right?

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:24.950
CHRIS WILSON: Exactly.

00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:25.670
Yes, yes.

00:23:25.670 --> 00:23:26.700
MATT ANDREWS: Would
it be too much to ask

00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:27.990
to have both systems?

00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:30.620
So that apps that clearly
needed loads of permissions

00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:33.080
could ask for them up,
but ones like TweetDeck,

00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:35.272
maybe you'd only need to
ask for the TweetDeck one

00:23:35.272 --> 00:23:36.480
when you actually wanted to--

00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:38.646
CHRIS WILSON: But see that's
kind of the wrong model

00:23:38.646 --> 00:23:41.102
because apps that need loads
of permissions-- every app is

00:23:41.102 --> 00:23:42.810
going to say I need
loads of permissions.

00:23:42.810 --> 00:23:44.730
MATT ANDREWS: But hopefully
they would care about their uses

00:23:44.730 --> 00:23:46.021
and their users would complain.

00:23:46.021 --> 00:23:47.370
And they would change that.

00:23:47.370 --> 00:23:49.120
CHRIS WILSON: You're
debating about people

00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:49.954
caring about things.

00:23:49.954 --> 00:23:51.370
MARCOS CACERES: I
think experience

00:23:51.370 --> 00:23:52.890
shows that that is
not how it works.

00:23:52.890 --> 00:23:54.940
Like if you give
people that foot gun,

00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:56.649
basically they're
going to use it.

00:23:56.649 --> 00:23:57.690
CHRIS WILSON: Absolutely.

00:23:57.690 --> 00:23:59.315
ELI FIDLER: Users
don't really complain

00:23:59.315 --> 00:24:01.480
about upfront
permission dialogs.

00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:04.334
They complain a lot when
their flow is interrupted.

00:24:04.334 --> 00:24:05.250
CHRIS WILSON: They do.

00:24:05.250 --> 00:24:07.710
I think though, that
the smart bit here

00:24:07.710 --> 00:24:10.220
is, we need to not just
say, every time you need

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:13.900
a permission, pop
a new dialogue.

00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:15.970
An app developer
needs to intelligently

00:24:15.970 --> 00:24:18.680
say, wait, I need
to be able to do x.

00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:21.520
And I can now explain
to them user in a way

00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:23.770
that they're going to
understand at that moment, why

00:24:23.770 --> 00:24:24.520
I need to do that.

00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:25.960
Like TweetDeck, for example.

00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:27.440
Instead of just
having, TweetDeck

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:29.540
wants to be able to
tweet on your behalf,

00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:31.340
it should be able
to say, hey, we

00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:33.900
need to post to Twitter when
you type stuff into the box.

00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:36.980
Like, just click OK and
we know we can do that.

00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:41.400
Or hopefully not click OK for
every permission, but something

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:44.055
where they can explain why
they need that ability.

00:24:44.055 --> 00:24:46.300
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Can we
get a microphone to Jonas?

00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:47.440
Put your hand up.

00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:49.290
I think you hit the
nail on the head when

00:24:49.290 --> 00:24:52.500
you made the comparison
to terms and conditions,

00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:54.580
because that's a model
that we know doesn't work.

00:24:54.580 --> 00:24:54.780
CHRIS WILSON: Exactly.

00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:55.610
JAKE ARCHIBALD: But we
still do it to users.

00:24:55.610 --> 00:24:56.360
CHRIS WILSON: Yes.

00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:58.100
Exactly like the ULA.

00:24:58.100 --> 00:24:59.675
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Well that's
like the source code of the law.

00:24:59.675 --> 00:24:59.940
CHRIS WILSON: Yes.

00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:02.064
JAKE ARCHIBALD: And we
still present that to users.

00:25:02.064 --> 00:25:05.210
I kind of wish that if we
detected a liar visiting

00:25:05.210 --> 00:25:08.060
one of our sites, we should just
serve up the raw source code.

00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:09.010
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:09.010 --> 00:25:10.440
JAKE ARCHIBALD: If they expect
us to read their source code

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:11.000
they should read ours.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:12.583
CHRIS WILSON: We can
make that happen.

00:25:12.583 --> 00:25:13.630
We can make that happen.

00:25:13.630 --> 00:25:16.060
JONAS: Yeah, so, a
couple of comments.

00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:21.440
First of all people are talking
about the web versus packaged

00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:24.790
apps and how packaged
apps have these properties

00:25:24.790 --> 00:25:27.720
from security permission
prompts and so on.

00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:32.570
And actually we don't
have to tie packaged apps

00:25:32.570 --> 00:25:33.990
to these prompts.

00:25:33.990 --> 00:25:40.340
In Firefox OS we use exactly the
same security model as the web.

00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:42.740
First of all, to try to have
as few prompts as possible.

00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:44.560
Like design API so
that you can do stuff

00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:47.910
without actually
impacting security.

00:25:47.910 --> 00:25:50.340
But then for APIs,
like geolocation,

00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:54.030
where we do want to prompt the
user-- even for packaged apps--

00:25:54.030 --> 00:25:55.860
we just follow the
normal web model

00:25:55.860 --> 00:25:59.370
and we ask for
permission in context.

00:25:59.370 --> 00:26:02.320
And so if there's a
TweetDeck app that

00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:05.580
needs to do some
special stuff then

00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:09.200
it can ask that at the time
when it needs to do it.

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:12.680
And what we've found
is that there's

00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:13.730
two things are important.

00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:16.430
It's very important
for applications.

00:26:16.430 --> 00:26:18.910
The context of asking at
the time when you do it

00:26:18.910 --> 00:26:21.640
helps users to understand
why this happens.

00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:26.180
But also enabling
applications to describe,

00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:27.450
why do I need to do this.

00:26:27.450 --> 00:26:29.990
Because many times this
can sort of look shocking

00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:32.940
that when you actually get a
chance to talk to the user,

00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:36.700
like, why do you need to read
my contact list, or why do

00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:38.524
you need to--

00:26:38.524 --> 00:26:40.440
JAKE ARCHIBALD: So what
kind of things Firefox

00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:41.794
OS us upfront permissions for?

00:26:41.794 --> 00:26:43.460
JONAS: We don't use
up front permissions

00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:44.293
for anything at all.

00:26:47.210 --> 00:26:52.180
So Firefox makes a distinction
between security questions

00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:53.830
and privacy questions.

00:26:53.830 --> 00:26:57.720
And what we've decided is that,
generally speaking, asking

00:26:57.720 --> 00:27:00.900
user security questions
is a bad idea.

00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:05.370
Because most people-- it's
hard to relate to them

00:27:05.370 --> 00:27:07.720
and to understand what
they're actually about.

00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:09.640
So asking the uses,
like, do you want

00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:12.490
this app to have
TCP socket access?

00:27:12.490 --> 00:27:14.352
That means nothing to people.

00:27:14.352 --> 00:27:16.060
JAKE ARCHIBALD: That
leads into something

00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:18.840
that was a very similar question
that was by Connell saying,

00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:21.580
yeah, are we asking too many
technical questions of users

00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:24.960
and then blaming them for
picking the wrong answer?

00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:26.970
For things like
sockets, or do you

00:27:26.970 --> 00:27:29.030
want this to access something.

00:27:29.030 --> 00:27:30.770
We've trained people
to just click OK.

00:27:30.770 --> 00:27:32.530
So even the web
model, are we starting

00:27:32.530 --> 00:27:34.987
to break that with these
too technical decisions.

00:27:34.987 --> 00:27:36.820
Also can we get a
microphone to Adam Singer.

00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:38.704
If you-- raise your hand.

00:27:38.704 --> 00:27:39.370
ADAM SINGER: Hi.

00:27:39.370 --> 00:27:41.661
I was little bit bugged there,
I don't work for Google.

00:27:41.661 --> 00:27:45.600
So talking about single page
applications-- so routing

00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:48.680
is like a fundamental component
of single page applications.

00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:51.060
So what could the web
platform do better?

00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:55.380
So it's more native
experience for routing?

00:27:55.380 --> 00:27:57.000
Why should we depend
on a framework

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.300
to handle our routing
for us, which then makes

00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:01.584
us buy into a framework
just to even develop a spot?

00:28:01.584 --> 00:28:03.000
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
I've actually done

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.720
routing without a
framework before.

00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:05.470
In fact, you can--

00:28:05.470 --> 00:28:06.060
ADAM SINGER: Is it fun?

00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:07.330
JAKE ARCHIBALD: A request
goes to the server

00:28:07.330 --> 00:28:08.642
and it works, right?

00:28:08.642 --> 00:28:09.142
Right?

00:28:09.142 --> 00:28:12.462
The web, yay?

00:28:12.462 --> 00:28:14.420
MARCOS CACERES: There's
a missing-- the missing

00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:16.770
bit is, I think, pre-loading.

00:28:16.770 --> 00:28:19.340
And pre-loading and--
for me personally, it's

00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:21.750
like pre-loading the page
that you're potentially

00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:24.610
going to navigate to and
transitioning to that page.

00:28:24.610 --> 00:28:29.030
And I think until we have those
things, until we can smoothly

00:28:29.030 --> 00:28:30.540
go from one page to another--

00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:32.380
BRIAN LEROUX: IE5
used to have that.

00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:33.050
MARCOS CACERES: And IE5--

00:28:33.050 --> 00:28:33.730
BRIAN LEROUX: It
probably still does.

00:28:33.730 --> 00:28:34.570
Remember those
awesome transitions?

00:28:34.570 --> 00:28:35.444
MARCOS CACERES: Yeah.

00:28:35.444 --> 00:28:37.597
And I think we need to
bring that-- I don't think

00:28:37.597 --> 00:28:39.180
we need to bring
that back but I think

00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:40.750
we need to look at that again.

00:28:40.750 --> 00:28:44.117
And I think the IE team-- you
worked there at that time?

00:28:44.117 --> 00:28:45.450
CHRIS WILSON: I have no comment.

00:28:45.450 --> 00:28:47.442
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:47.442 --> 00:28:49.150
MARCOS CACERES: Because
it wasn't-- like,

00:28:49.150 --> 00:28:50.460
it was a cool feature.

00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:51.900
CHRIS WILSON: Yes, it was.

00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:52.870
MARCOS CACERES: And it
was an interesting feature

00:28:52.870 --> 00:28:55.490
and I think we might need to
actually look at that again.

00:28:55.490 --> 00:28:56.240
CHRIS WILSON: Yep.

00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:57.781
MARCOS CACERES: And
I know, like-- is

00:28:57.781 --> 00:29:00.060
Ilya Grigorik around somewhere?

00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:01.780
Maybe not here yet.

00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:02.820
Oh, he's over there.

00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:06.402
So I know Ilya is working on
the pre-render render spec.

00:29:06.402 --> 00:29:08.110
You know they bring
it to pre-render page

00:29:08.110 --> 00:29:10.730
and then you quickly navigate
to it and it's instantaneous.

00:29:10.730 --> 00:29:13.660
So that may help with
the whole routing thing.

00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:15.452
So you don't need single
page apps so much.

00:29:15.452 --> 00:29:17.076
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Can
we get a microphone

00:29:17.076 --> 00:29:18.822
to Alex Russell,
wherever he's hiding?

00:29:18.822 --> 00:29:21.210
Oh, he's over there.

00:29:21.210 --> 00:29:24.582
So what do you think transitions
are going to give us then?

00:29:24.582 --> 00:29:25.767
What does that break?

00:29:25.767 --> 00:29:27.850
MARCOS CACERES: Well then
you can slide in a page.

00:29:27.850 --> 00:29:30.308
Slide it in from the left side,
slide it in from the right.

00:29:30.308 --> 00:29:33.030
BRIAN LEROUX: But state gets
blown away in the process, so.

00:29:33.030 --> 00:29:34.200
MARCOS CACERES: Maybe.

00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:35.300
But, yeah, I don't know.

00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:36.133
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:29:36.133 --> 00:29:38.980
BRIAN LEROUX: You could keep
all your logic and index DB

00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:41.294
and load it when the page--

00:29:41.294 --> 00:29:41.794
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:41.794 --> 00:29:42.676
MARCOS CACERES: Yeah, why not?

00:29:42.676 --> 00:29:44.400
JAKE ARCHIBALD: And answer
that starts index DB

00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:45.260
is the wrong answer.

00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:46.092
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:46.092 --> 00:29:47.550
BRIAN LEROUX: Right,
local storage.

00:29:47.550 --> 00:29:51.130
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:51.130 --> 00:29:53.290
ALEX RUSSELL: Hi, just
a couple of comments.

00:29:53.290 --> 00:29:55.822
The first is that there is
work, Marcos, to your point,

00:29:55.822 --> 00:29:57.780
happening in Chromium
right now about something

00:29:57.780 --> 00:29:59.150
called navigation transitions.

00:29:59.150 --> 00:30:04.160
Which bring HTML transition
filters of your back,

00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:05.760
but for specific
elements that pages

00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:09.290
want to send to other pages
to transition through.

00:30:09.290 --> 00:30:11.600
So that code-- patches
are landing now.

00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:14.980
So that's not obviously
a standard yet,

00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:17.970
but it's something
that we're working on.

00:30:17.970 --> 00:30:19.565
Similarly, patches
have just landed

00:30:19.565 --> 00:30:22.030
in Chromium for
manifest support.

00:30:22.030 --> 00:30:28.795
And the add to desktop widget
for your Chrome for Android

00:30:28.795 --> 00:30:30.670
is going to take
advantage of those soon.

00:30:30.670 --> 00:30:32.670
So that's a hopeful step
in then next direction.

00:30:32.670 --> 00:30:34.045
And I think to
the routing point,

00:30:34.045 --> 00:30:35.430
it's a very interesting one.

00:30:35.430 --> 00:30:37.790
I'm hopeful-- again, I'm
one of the people who

00:30:37.790 --> 00:30:40.850
bang on about service workers,
because I'm working on it.

00:30:40.850 --> 00:30:44.270
I'm hopeful that we can offload,
in many cases, a lot of that

00:30:44.270 --> 00:30:47.730
to the client side without
changing the model of how

00:30:47.730 --> 00:30:49.371
a single page is constructed.

00:30:49.371 --> 00:30:51.620
Single page applications are
muddled because you often

00:30:51.620 --> 00:30:54.330
wind up having to rebuild
URL structure afterwards.

00:30:54.330 --> 00:30:57.060
And what you sort of want is
navigations to be hung off

00:30:57.060 --> 00:30:57.600
of URLs.

00:30:57.600 --> 00:30:59.930
But then to end up at
the next page with it

00:30:59.930 --> 00:31:01.580
a URL and a good UI.

00:31:01.580 --> 00:31:03.420
Navigation transitions
plus service workers

00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:05.110
should hopefully give you
a lot of responsiveness

00:31:05.110 --> 00:31:06.680
without having to
go to the network

00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:09.000
and flash white in
front of the user.

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.700
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Matt, when you
were building the FT stuff,

00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:12.950
how were you handling routing.

00:31:12.950 --> 00:31:14.660
Were you using just
normal web requests?

00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:16.362
Or were you kind
of hijacking that?

00:31:16.362 --> 00:31:17.820
MATT ANDREWS: So
yeah, with the web

00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:20.970
apps we've got at the moment
it is, listens to the clicks,

00:31:20.970 --> 00:31:23.150
look in the URL in
[INAUDIBLE] counselor

00:31:23.150 --> 00:31:26.827
and then rebuild it in the
very front end of the browser.

00:31:26.827 --> 00:31:28.410
I've been playing
with service worker,

00:31:28.410 --> 00:31:30.640
and with the early
things in Canary.

00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:32.770
And you can move
all that into kind

00:31:32.770 --> 00:31:35.459
of-- well, if the back
end's to your server

00:31:35.459 --> 00:31:37.750
and the front end's your
website, like, the middle end.

00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:39.760
So something that
pretends to be a server.

00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:44.190
And that's much easier.

00:31:44.190 --> 00:31:46.060
Although you do lose
state between each one,

00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:48.140
you could store that state.

00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:50.710
Index DB is not great,
but you could do that.

00:31:53.844 --> 00:31:55.760
There's something alive
that lives longer than

00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:58.510
that page that you could store
say in-- I not you're not

00:31:58.510 --> 00:32:01.892
supposed source it in service
worker, but you could do it.

00:32:01.892 --> 00:32:03.780
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:05.600
But the point is you
don't have to worry

00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:07.720
about the other
consequences of having

00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:09.600
that state in the front end.

00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:11.675
Because you have the
potential for pages

00:32:11.675 --> 00:32:13.684
to start interfering
with each other.

00:32:13.684 --> 00:32:15.100
You have an advert
on one and that

00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:17.684
could break something
completely unrelated.

00:32:17.684 --> 00:32:19.225
So the nice thing
with service worker

00:32:19.225 --> 00:32:23.930
is you get a fresh instance
of the browser page each time.

00:32:23.930 --> 00:32:25.680
JAKE ARCHIBALD: So I
think with that we're

00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:28.013
going to move on to the next
question, which is actually

00:32:28.013 --> 00:32:31.630
my favorite question that
appeared in Google Moderator.

00:32:31.630 --> 00:32:34.520
And yes, that is this.

00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:37.820
Angle bracket, slash text
area, close angle bracket,

00:32:37.820 --> 00:32:39.749
image source y on
error prompt one.

00:32:39.749 --> 00:32:41.540
I'm going to direct
this question at Brian.

00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:43.430
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:45.934
I think that came from
little Bobby Tables.

00:32:45.934 --> 00:32:47.830
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:50.430
BRIAN LEROUX: I like that
they've done this HTML5 style

00:32:50.430 --> 00:32:52.750
without having to
quote their attributes.

00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:53.490
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:53.490 --> 00:32:54.270
It's a good style.

00:32:54.270 --> 00:32:56.270
JAKE ARCHIBALD: That's
actually from the future.

00:32:56.270 --> 00:32:56.880
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:59.380
Well, we'll probably move on
from that to the next question.

00:32:59.380 --> 00:33:01.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:04.870
So this came from Connell,
who's provided actually

00:33:04.870 --> 00:33:06.370
a lot of the really
good questions

00:33:06.370 --> 00:33:09.220
for many of the panels, so
you'll get bored of his name

00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:12.360
soon. "Instead of asking for
permissions for small things,

00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:14.770
can browsers instead
infer a level of trust

00:33:14.770 --> 00:33:17.040
from other factors such
as usage frequency,

00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:19.710
whether it's from bookmarked
or reputation of the domain?"

00:33:19.710 --> 00:33:21.550
Chris, you're Google, right?

00:33:21.550 --> 00:33:23.060
Should Google
decide which domains

00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:25.230
get enhanced permissions
based on our ratings?

00:33:25.230 --> 00:33:26.980
Because that sounds
like the kind of thing

00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:28.500
the public would really love.

00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:29.541
CHRIS WILSON: Absolutely.

00:33:29.541 --> 00:33:30.980
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:33.760
I think users will be
as delighted with that

00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:36.300
as they are to get ads that
are more applicable to them.

00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:38.540
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:41.190
And I mean that completely.

00:33:41.190 --> 00:33:45.030
No, I mean I think that
we already, in some ways,

00:33:45.030 --> 00:33:48.080
we already do similar things.

00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:51.220
In that if you visit
a page with HTTPS

00:33:51.220 --> 00:33:54.382
and it asks for access to
the microphone, for example,

00:33:54.382 --> 00:33:56.340
the next time you visit
it, we don't ask again.

00:33:56.340 --> 00:33:59.040
We cache that, we
remember that you said OK,

00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:00.680
and it's a secure domain.

00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:03.190
"Secure" domain.

00:34:03.190 --> 00:34:07.440
I do think that there are
things in that question that

00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:12.000
make a small trickle of
sweat go down my spine.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:15.250
So I won't say absolutely, we
should do all of these things.

00:34:15.250 --> 00:34:17.739
But I do think that being
more intelligent about how

00:34:17.739 --> 00:34:19.560
we can infer trust
from other things

00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:22.280
that the user has
said or done, as long

00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:26.100
as we can have a clear, secure
track back to the domain.

00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:29.280
I think that that's
probably the right future.

00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:31.082
But we're several
steps from there still.

00:34:31.082 --> 00:34:33.290
JAKE ARCHIBALD: So rather
than completely deciding it

00:34:33.290 --> 00:34:35.560
based on ratings, if
something like bookmarking

00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:38.940
was used as a signal, is that
something that sounds fair?

00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:39.808
CHRIS WILSON: Yeah.

00:34:39.808 --> 00:34:41.891
ELI FIDLER: Bookmarking
is used as a signal today.

00:34:41.891 --> 00:34:45.904
So if you saved a
home screen on iOS

00:34:45.904 --> 00:34:47.570
and then launch it
from the home screen,

00:34:47.570 --> 00:34:50.469
it can control mostly at
every pixel of the screen.

00:34:50.469 --> 00:34:52.820
That's not a
permission that we give

00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:54.279
to websites in the browser.

00:34:54.279 --> 00:34:56.070
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Hmm, true, true.

00:34:56.070 --> 00:34:58.350
What kind of permissions
would make sense

00:34:58.350 --> 00:34:59.890
to sort of auto-grant
for something

00:34:59.890 --> 00:35:03.180
that was added to the home
screen that wouldn't surprise

00:35:03.180 --> 00:35:04.772
a user that we've granted that?

00:35:04.772 --> 00:35:06.480
CHRIS WILSON: I think
that's a challenge.

00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:09.790
Because that's true, if
you add to home screen

00:35:09.790 --> 00:35:11.450
you get a bunch of extra rights.

00:35:11.450 --> 00:35:14.570
And I'll also say that I
think, add to home screen

00:35:14.570 --> 00:35:20.000
is the worst thing today because
it's buried in every mobile OS

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:21.070
that I've seen.

00:35:21.070 --> 00:35:24.280
And hard to find, hard to
discover for average users.

00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:26.470
I mean, I think in
Android, you have

00:35:26.470 --> 00:35:29.150
to click an icon that's
not at all intuitive

00:35:29.150 --> 00:35:32.860
and then it's like, at the very
bottom on my phone, where it's

00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:34.820
almost getting cut
off the screen.

00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:37.390
Which seems really bizarre for
something that I want to do.

00:35:37.390 --> 00:35:39.420
And as a user it's
not clear that when

00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:41.780
I click that I'm giving
additional rights.

00:35:41.780 --> 00:35:43.670
Like it means
something other than

00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:45.930
stick an icon on my
home screen somewhere.

00:35:45.930 --> 00:35:47.730
And that bit, I'm a
little worried about.

00:35:47.730 --> 00:35:49.070
How we explain that to users.

00:35:49.070 --> 00:35:53.947
That it's not install, it's not
this gigantic Android-esque,

00:35:53.947 --> 00:35:56.030
here are all the permissions
that you're magically

00:35:56.030 --> 00:35:56.710
getting now.

00:35:56.710 --> 00:35:59.380
Are you sure you're OK with
that, good, kind of thing.

00:35:59.380 --> 00:36:02.650
But it does also
somehow indicate

00:36:02.650 --> 00:36:04.517
to the user in an obvious way--

00:36:04.517 --> 00:36:06.100
MARCOS CACERES: But
this is like where

00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:08.680
Adrian's diagram
comes into play.

00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:12.140
Because adding to home
screen and getting

00:36:12.140 --> 00:36:15.039
all the pixels is
a minor annoyance.

00:36:15.039 --> 00:36:16.080
CHRIS WILSON: It is, yes.

00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:17.455
MARCOS CACERES:
So there is that.

00:36:17.455 --> 00:36:20.180
So maybe there shouldn't
be a permission for that?

00:36:20.180 --> 00:36:22.292
So again, it's trying to
find that balance and--

00:36:22.292 --> 00:36:24.000
BRIAN LEROUX: I think
the biggest problem

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:25.480
we've got right
now is that we've

00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:27.930
spent seven years
teaching people

00:36:27.930 --> 00:36:30.240
to install apps
from the app store.

00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:33.270
And we've spent seven years of
people thinking that discovery

00:36:33.270 --> 00:36:36.390
happens by going to Play
or going to an app store.

00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:38.480
And there's no-- I
guess the closest

00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:40.392
thing we have right
now is like, Google

00:36:40.392 --> 00:36:41.850
would be the app
store for the web.

00:36:41.850 --> 00:36:45.567
But there's no way for us
to say, OK, this is a thing,

00:36:45.567 --> 00:36:47.400
and this thing's going
to be on your device.

00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:49.500
And it's going to do
things that maybe you

00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:51.452
wouldn't want it
to do necessarily.

00:36:51.452 --> 00:36:53.910
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Can we get a
microphone to Guy, by the way.

00:36:53.910 --> 00:36:56.840
CHRIS WILSON: We've also spent
more than 20 years teaching

00:36:56.840 --> 00:36:59.040
people that everything on
the web is totally safe.

00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:00.281
And don't worry about it.

00:37:00.281 --> 00:37:00.780
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:03.410
And now we're-- as Jake said
at the beginning, now there's--

00:37:03.410 --> 00:37:04.830
BRIAN LEROUX: As long as there's
a little lock, it's all good.

00:37:04.830 --> 00:37:05.720
CHRIS WILSON: Yeah.

00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:08.490
Even without the lock, you
can't do anything dangerous.

00:37:08.490 --> 00:37:10.240
GUY: I just wanted to
point out that there

00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:12.448
might be a difference between
the permissions of what

00:37:12.448 --> 00:37:13.350
we're talking about.

00:37:13.350 --> 00:37:15.683
So sometimes there are security
and privacy permissions.

00:37:15.683 --> 00:37:18.020
And also kind of
makes wet trickle down

00:37:18.020 --> 00:37:21.097
my spine to think that
Google would determine

00:37:21.097 --> 00:37:22.680
to give my location
away, or something

00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:24.850
like that based on usage.

00:37:24.850 --> 00:37:26.764
On the other hand,
things like resources,

00:37:26.764 --> 00:37:28.680
quota for local storage--
if everybody started

00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:31.407
using local storage of the
new service worker quota,

00:37:31.407 --> 00:37:33.490
you know, there would be
a problem for the agents.

00:37:33.490 --> 00:37:36.400
You know, when does the
machine blow up and run out

00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:37.130
of the space.

00:37:37.130 --> 00:37:40.680
Maybe things around usability
or accessibility, what gets

00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:42.420
loaded up first and
things like that.

00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:45.440
So we might want
to split-- I guess

00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:48.910
to me, for certain types of
permissions we prompt for today

00:37:48.910 --> 00:37:50.930
that are more around
usage and resources,

00:37:50.930 --> 00:37:52.380
it makes sense that
the browser would infer

00:37:52.380 --> 00:37:53.754
for privacy and
security reasons.

00:37:56.681 --> 00:37:58.430
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Marcos,
what kind of stuff

00:37:58.430 --> 00:38:02.080
does Firefox OS
give you by default

00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:03.362
if you're an installed app?

00:38:03.362 --> 00:38:04.695
Is there anything in particular?

00:38:04.695 --> 00:38:05.200
MARCOS CACERES:
So I'll be honest,

00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:06.894
I don't know too much
about Firefox OS,

00:38:06.894 --> 00:38:08.310
because I mostly
focus on the web.

00:38:08.310 --> 00:38:11.737
But we could ask Jonas, because
Jonas is like-- you know.

00:38:11.737 --> 00:38:12.570
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:20.250
JAKE ARCHIBALD: I guess
a question I'd ask

00:38:20.250 --> 00:38:23.190
is how to you handle
things like disk space?

00:38:23.190 --> 00:38:25.530
Is that something that you
give the user for free?

00:38:25.530 --> 00:38:29.130
JONAS: Yeah, so our
design policy has been,

00:38:29.130 --> 00:38:30.840
once the user
installs something you

00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:34.510
get to use resources
as much as you want.

00:38:34.510 --> 00:38:36.310
You get unlimited
access to resources.

00:38:36.310 --> 00:38:41.700
So that's things like CPU
running in the background, band

00:38:41.700 --> 00:38:46.310
wave, and storing stuff to disk.

00:38:46.310 --> 00:38:48.070
And then you also get
to annoy the user.

00:38:48.070 --> 00:38:50.260
So things like,
notifications will

00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:53.430
let you do without any prompts.

00:38:53.430 --> 00:38:55.910
And the idea has
been that we give you

00:38:55.910 --> 00:38:58.702
the users all of these--
or we give applications

00:38:58.702 --> 00:39:00.910
all these things, but then
we give tools to the users

00:39:00.910 --> 00:39:02.950
so can dial it down
if they want to.

00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:05.029
So users can say, this
is very annoying app,

00:39:05.029 --> 00:39:06.820
I'm going to turn off
notifications for it,

00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:07.695
or just uninstall it.

00:39:07.695 --> 00:39:09.861
JAKE ARCHIBALD: So should
we do the same on the web?

00:39:09.861 --> 00:39:10.750
Add to home screens?

00:39:10.750 --> 00:39:12.284
Same style permissions?

00:39:12.284 --> 00:39:13.950
MARCOS CACERES: I
mean, I would say yes.

00:39:13.950 --> 00:39:15.991
Like if you're going to
do that then integrate it

00:39:15.991 --> 00:39:19.580
into the system as
much as possible.

00:39:19.580 --> 00:39:20.990
CHRIS WILSON: But it--

00:39:20.990 --> 00:39:24.010
BRIAN LEROUX: Firefox also has
three layers of apps though.

00:39:24.010 --> 00:39:28.280
There's implicit
on board blessed

00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:30.370
apps that get full
system access,

00:39:30.370 --> 00:39:33.880
then there's installed
apps from the wild,

00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:35.980
and they don't get
full system access.

00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:37.610
Isn't that the case currently?

00:39:37.610 --> 00:39:40.010
Like there's two layers?

00:39:40.010 --> 00:39:42.290
MARCOS CACERES: Hosted
apps, certified, and--

00:39:42.290 --> 00:39:43.190
BRIAN LEROUX: Yeah.

00:39:43.190 --> 00:39:44.356
JONAS: We have three levels.

00:39:44.356 --> 00:39:47.410
We have the certified
apps that are built-in.

00:39:47.410 --> 00:39:51.020
We have privileged apps which
have to be signed and reviewed

00:39:51.020 --> 00:39:52.860
by the Mozilla marketplace.

00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:55.579
And then we have
normal web apps.

00:39:55.579 --> 00:39:58.120
BRIAN LEROUX: So that's the same
as-- well it's not the same,

00:39:58.120 --> 00:39:59.911
but it's similar to
Apple's security model.

00:39:59.911 --> 00:40:01.850
There's a curation
process, which

00:40:01.850 --> 00:40:04.330
is-- I think this is the thing
that the web community is

00:40:04.330 --> 00:40:05.747
like most adverse to.

00:40:05.747 --> 00:40:07.622
You know, we don't like
the idea that there's

00:40:07.622 --> 00:40:10.000
a central place where
someone gets to curate,

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:13.150
effectively censor, what
other people get to see.

00:40:13.150 --> 00:40:16.830
And at the same time, we
don't want My Little Pony apps

00:40:16.830 --> 00:40:20.010
turning into the gambling,
porno app overnight.

00:40:20.010 --> 00:40:22.260
CHRIS WILSON: Well even more
than My Little Pony apps,

00:40:22.260 --> 00:40:24.220
which my daughter's
would love, you

00:40:24.220 --> 00:40:27.600
need the ability to have
some kind of insight

00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:30.060
into where your
disk space is going.

00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:33.200
Like particularly when we're
talking about mobile devices.

00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:37.260
That storage is still a
somewhat limited quantity.

00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:39.332
And I don't want
every application

00:40:39.332 --> 00:40:41.040
to think, yeah, it's
totally cool to dump

00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:44.099
100 gigabytes of
stuff onto my device.

00:40:44.099 --> 00:40:45.890
Because it may not be,
but at the same time

00:40:45.890 --> 00:40:47.515
there are certainly
applications that I

00:40:47.515 --> 00:40:50.960
want to be able to store
100 gigabytes of game data

00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:52.470
or whatever, and keep it there.

00:40:52.470 --> 00:40:55.220
And don't just arbitrarily
dump it out of cache

00:40:55.220 --> 00:40:56.340
because you need some.

00:40:56.340 --> 00:40:58.048
JAKE ARCHIBALD: We've
got the Cordova API

00:40:58.048 --> 00:41:00.102
and Mozilla's not too
keen on that right?

00:41:00.102 --> 00:41:01.560
MARCOS CACERES:
Not that I know of.

00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:06.080
But the thing is that
you can handle that thing

00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:07.610
in different ways, right?

00:41:07.610 --> 00:41:09.120
There are other
signals we can use.

00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:10.828
The way you don't need
to annoy the user.

00:41:10.828 --> 00:41:13.440
You can annoy the user if you
want, but you don't have to.

00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:14.900
Then there are
other places where

00:41:14.900 --> 00:41:16.733
you can go within the
device to actually see

00:41:16.733 --> 00:41:18.800
which app is actually
using up how much space.

00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:20.630
Which is what happens
in Firefox OS.

00:41:20.630 --> 00:41:25.250
And so there are various ways
to manage it that don't actually

00:41:25.250 --> 00:41:28.132
have to have an
API bound to them.

00:41:28.132 --> 00:41:30.340
JAKE ARCHIBALD: So Alex do
you have something to say?

00:41:30.340 --> 00:41:33.410
You're on that screen,
but not that screen.

00:41:33.410 --> 00:41:35.276
So do you have something to say?

00:41:39.107 --> 00:41:40.440
ALEX RUSSELL: Again, two things.

00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:44.490
So the first is that, I think,
between Marcos and Jonas

00:41:44.490 --> 00:41:47.300
we've identified a really
interesting split between, sort

00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:49.910
of the web-centric view of what
it means to have a permission,

00:41:49.910 --> 00:41:52.030
sort of ambulantly
granted, and then

00:41:52.030 --> 00:41:53.530
sort of the trust
level view of what

00:41:53.530 --> 00:41:55.210
it means to have a
permission granted.

00:41:55.210 --> 00:42:00.110
And I think, even inside
of one organization,

00:42:00.110 --> 00:42:01.760
you see multiple
opinions expressed.

00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:04.176
And I think one of the things
that we're trying to do now,

00:42:04.176 --> 00:42:07.200
in the design of new web
APIs is to make sure--

00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:11.019
and vendors, even inside
the same organization,

00:42:11.019 --> 00:42:13.310
different vendors and even
inside the same organization

00:42:13.310 --> 00:42:16.180
can express different
policies without having

00:42:16.180 --> 00:42:18.460
to agree on different APIs.

00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:20.510
So one of things
that I think people

00:42:20.510 --> 00:42:22.330
get very bound up
in is exactly what

00:42:22.330 --> 00:42:25.860
the UI for a particular
policy is going to be.

00:42:25.860 --> 00:42:28.462
But if we make these requests
for permission asynchronous,

00:42:28.462 --> 00:42:29.920
we make it the
developer's problem,

00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:30.820
on some level to deal with.

00:42:30.820 --> 00:42:32.403
And I think that's
one of the big ways

00:42:32.403 --> 00:42:33.730
out that we can evolve through.

00:42:33.730 --> 00:42:35.230
Because we don't
have agreement yet.

00:42:35.230 --> 00:42:37.670
And getting agreement is going
to require experimentation.

00:42:37.670 --> 00:42:41.580
The second side of
this is that it's

00:42:41.580 --> 00:42:44.932
one thing for Google to sort
of automatically intuit who

00:42:44.932 --> 00:42:46.140
should have what permissions.

00:42:46.140 --> 00:42:49.150
And I think that sounds very
scary to everyone including me.

00:42:49.150 --> 00:42:52.890
But we don't necessarily
feel bad about Google

00:42:52.890 --> 00:42:54.570
running the safe
browsing system.

00:42:54.570 --> 00:42:57.750
And so the idea that we're going
to be able to hit Control Z

00:42:57.750 --> 00:43:01.506
and keep users safe once we
acquire some knowledge of abuse

00:43:01.506 --> 00:43:03.880
is very different to the idea
that we're going to mediate

00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:06.340
upfront permissions,
outside of the user's intent

00:43:06.340 --> 00:43:09.390
and outside the user-presented
model of what they think

00:43:09.390 --> 00:43:11.780
is going to happen when they
decide to keep or install

00:43:11.780 --> 00:43:14.500
a particular thing, or agree
to a particular pop up.

00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:18.800
So it's good, and we
surface a bunch of the UI

00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:21.740
for mediating these permissions
once they're granted.

00:43:21.740 --> 00:43:25.480
But I think we need to
keep in mind that it's

00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:27.810
more important to be able
to hit Control Z then

00:43:27.810 --> 00:43:30.070
to mediate the upfront thing.

00:43:30.070 --> 00:43:32.090
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
So Chris Messiner,

00:43:32.090 --> 00:43:34.511
are you-- oh you got a
microphone, go for it.

00:43:34.511 --> 00:43:35.386
CHRIS MESSINER: Test.

00:43:35.386 --> 00:43:35.886
OK.

00:43:35.886 --> 00:43:39.460
So you guys are sort of
taking a look at this

00:43:39.460 --> 00:43:41.230
from the current
state of technology

00:43:41.230 --> 00:43:43.810
but we're on the cusp
of user interfaces,

00:43:43.810 --> 00:43:46.180
in particular, that don't
actually require pixels.

00:43:46.180 --> 00:43:48.370
So whether it's a
voice activated thing

00:43:48.370 --> 00:43:51.584
or you're in the car
and you're driving,

00:43:51.584 --> 00:43:53.000
or there's shared
interfaces where

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.290
it's more of a collaborative,
computing experience,

00:43:55.290 --> 00:43:57.950
where does all of
these problems go

00:43:57.950 --> 00:43:59.240
and how do you deal with that?

00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:01.115
What happens when there's
multiple users that

00:44:01.115 --> 00:44:01.890
are authenticated?

00:44:01.890 --> 00:44:03.848
And again, what happens
when you don't actually

00:44:03.848 --> 00:44:07.380
have pixels to display with
text for a user to read?

00:44:07.380 --> 00:44:09.150
What does that look like?

00:44:09.150 --> 00:44:13.000
CHRIS WILSON: I that's one
of the reasons why this model

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:17.340
where the developer's more
in control of when they ask

00:44:17.340 --> 00:44:19.580
the question-- when they
say to the user, hey,

00:44:19.580 --> 00:44:23.150
I want the ability
to x because y.

00:44:23.150 --> 00:44:25.412
I think that lets you
build applications

00:44:25.412 --> 00:44:26.620
that have that sort of thing.

00:44:26.620 --> 00:44:29.560
Where you don't necessarily
have a screen all the time

00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:30.740
to look at things.

00:44:30.740 --> 00:44:33.470
Now the question of, if
you never have a screen,

00:44:33.470 --> 00:44:37.760
I think that becomes even harder
and then it's sort of, well,

00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:38.810
what does that lock to?

00:44:38.810 --> 00:44:41.670
Like, at some level do you
have to have permissions

00:44:41.670 --> 00:44:43.610
that are read out to the user?

00:44:43.610 --> 00:44:46.580
If it's a voice
interaction system?

00:44:46.580 --> 00:44:48.350
Probably, unless
you've locked it

00:44:48.350 --> 00:44:52.140
to some set of the apps upfront
that are pre-authenticated,

00:44:52.140 --> 00:44:54.004
in which case, you're good.

00:44:54.004 --> 00:44:55.420
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
So with that we're

00:44:55.420 --> 00:45:00.490
going to move onto the next
question, which comes from me.

00:45:00.490 --> 00:45:03.960
Assuming we fix offline
and install-ability-- all

00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:06.127
of these problems are solved.

00:45:06.127 --> 00:45:06.960
BRIAN LEROUX: Sweet.

00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:08.440
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah, great.

00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:11.410
But how do we get people
to expect them to work?

00:45:11.410 --> 00:45:15.540
How can a user expect
the web to work offline?

00:45:15.540 --> 00:45:17.064
Or have these
advanced capabilities?

00:45:17.064 --> 00:45:18.480
CHRIS WILSON: Jake,
what do thing?

00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:19.510
JAKE ARCHIBALD: I
have no idea, that's

00:45:19.510 --> 00:45:20.718
why I put the question there.

00:45:20.718 --> 00:45:23.212
I was hoping we could
sort this out right now.

00:45:23.212 --> 00:45:25.670
BRIAN LEROUX: I don't anybody's
figured this out, including

00:45:25.670 --> 00:45:26.710
native apps, right?

00:45:26.710 --> 00:45:28.210
We're still having
a lot of trouble.

00:45:28.210 --> 00:45:29.668
You can't install
an app unless you

00:45:29.668 --> 00:45:32.850
are online which is something
people seem to forget a lot.

00:45:32.850 --> 00:45:35.710
And now once you've got
that app installed-- like,

00:45:35.710 --> 00:45:38.152
even Twitter thrashers
when it's starting up.

00:45:38.152 --> 00:45:39.860
It's like, oh, what
am I doing right now?

00:45:39.860 --> 00:45:42.700
Am I loading new
stuff or am I showing

00:45:42.700 --> 00:45:44.970
you stuff that you
already had here?

00:45:44.970 --> 00:45:47.710
You have the noticeable three
second delay with Twitter.

00:45:47.710 --> 00:45:50.711
Which is probably one of the top
used apps on everybody's phone

00:45:50.711 --> 00:45:51.210
here.

00:45:51.210 --> 00:45:53.520
So what's it going to look like?

00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:54.160
I don't know.

00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:55.130
Not that.

00:45:55.130 --> 00:45:55.822
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:55.822 --> 00:45:58.280
MATT ANDREWS: Maybe this is
the developer's responsibility.

00:45:58.280 --> 00:45:59.072
Maybe this is not--

00:45:59.072 --> 00:46:00.529
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
You're a developer.

00:46:00.529 --> 00:46:03.210
MATT ANDREWS: Well, not the
browser's responsibility,

00:46:03.210 --> 00:46:04.070
our responsibility.

00:46:04.070 --> 00:46:06.780
Because it's up to us to make
a good experience, firstly.

00:46:06.780 --> 00:46:08.863
And there's no point
shouting, "it works offline,"

00:46:08.863 --> 00:46:11.485
if, when people actually come
around to using it, it doesn't.

00:46:11.485 --> 00:46:15.489
JAKE ARCHIBALD: So how did you
handle that in the FT case?

00:46:15.489 --> 00:46:17.280
MATT ANDREWS: Well, we
just shout about it.

00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:18.962
You know, it's on
all of the adverts

00:46:18.962 --> 00:46:20.170
for all of the promos for it.

00:46:20.170 --> 00:46:23.040
I mean if you've ever visited
FT.com on your mobile device,

00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:26.459
you get a big, irritating
thing that comes up and says,

00:46:26.459 --> 00:46:28.500
use our app because that's
what you'd want to do.

00:46:30.934 --> 00:46:33.350
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Did you find
users actually using offline?

00:46:33.350 --> 00:46:35.767
I guess it's difficult
to do analytics on that.

00:46:35.767 --> 00:46:37.600
MATT ANDREWS: No, we
have analytics on that.

00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:39.814
We have analytics on that.

00:46:39.814 --> 00:46:41.480
Basically we get, we
people are offline,

00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:43.240
we store in local
storage and then--

00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:43.930
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Oh, cool.

00:46:43.930 --> 00:46:45.470
MATT ANDREWS: Taking it
back when-- yeah, yeah.

00:46:45.470 --> 00:46:46.330
JAKE ARCHIBALD: You did do it?

00:46:46.330 --> 00:46:48.890
MATT ANDREWS: There are some
subtle complexities with that

00:46:48.890 --> 00:46:51.750
but, yeah, I think 20%
of traffic is offline.

00:46:51.750 --> 00:46:53.089
Or something like that.

00:46:53.089 --> 00:46:55.380
That's quite an old stat, so
it might be different now.

00:46:55.380 --> 00:46:56.570
But yeah, people use it.

00:46:56.570 --> 00:46:58.934
People complain
when we break it,

00:46:58.934 --> 00:47:00.100
which happens sometimes too.

00:47:04.094 --> 00:47:06.510
JAKE ARCHIBALD: So I know more
about the state of iOS apps

00:47:06.510 --> 00:47:08.120
than Android apps.

00:47:08.120 --> 00:47:10.520
Do the majority of
BlackBerry apps work offline?

00:47:10.520 --> 00:47:12.978
Do you find that the ones are
sort of, built in the Cordova

00:47:12.978 --> 00:47:14.465
way, are they offline capable?

00:47:14.465 --> 00:47:16.820
Is that well
communicated to the user?

00:47:16.820 --> 00:47:21.650
ELI FIDLER: I think a lot of
them are available offline.

00:47:21.650 --> 00:47:24.670
Obviously app
developers don't always

00:47:24.670 --> 00:47:25.890
do a good job about this.

00:47:25.890 --> 00:47:29.910
Even top apps often don't
do a good job with this.

00:47:29.910 --> 00:47:32.132
But for the Cordova
style case, there's

00:47:32.132 --> 00:47:34.090
something fundamental
about the technology that

00:47:34.090 --> 00:47:37.249
makes it that hard to implement
something that works offline.

00:47:37.249 --> 00:47:39.040
In the browser, that's
a different problem.

00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:41.150
We know that there's lots of
issues with the technology

00:47:41.150 --> 00:47:41.480
there.

00:47:41.480 --> 00:47:43.646
But we know that users don't
expect that [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:43.646 --> 00:47:46.456
to work offline, even
if it could today.

00:47:46.456 --> 00:47:48.845
If you hit the browser icon
people don't expect that.

00:47:48.845 --> 00:47:50.470
MATT ANDREWS: But if
we did train users

00:47:50.470 --> 00:47:52.580
to expect to use it offline,
they'd be disappointed a lot.

00:47:52.580 --> 00:47:54.246
Because I think most
websites, no matter

00:47:54.246 --> 00:47:56.380
how much we say it's
possible, most websites

00:47:56.380 --> 00:47:57.297
won't bother to do it.

00:47:57.297 --> 00:47:59.213
CHRIS WILSON: But I think
we train users today

00:47:59.213 --> 00:48:00.470
that native apps work offline.

00:48:00.470 --> 00:48:04.367
And I'm frequently
disappointed then as well.

00:48:04.367 --> 00:48:06.200
JAKE ARCHIBALD: So
you've saying the Cordova

00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:07.500
stuff doesn't work offline well?

00:48:07.500 --> 00:48:08.010
Is that your?

00:48:08.010 --> 00:48:08.968
ELI FIDLER: No it does.

00:48:08.968 --> 00:48:10.030
JAKE ARCHIBALD: It does.

00:48:10.030 --> 00:48:12.071
ELI FIDLER: The technology
makes it work offline.

00:48:12.071 --> 00:48:13.660
So then it's up to
the app developers.

00:48:13.660 --> 00:48:15.160
BRIAN LEROUX: So
this actually keyed

00:48:15.160 --> 00:48:17.201
on something that's been
bugging us a lot lately.

00:48:17.201 --> 00:48:20.140
So the way Cordova works today,
we load off the file protocol.

00:48:20.140 --> 00:48:22.900
So anything on file, colon,
slash, slash, we load it.

00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:25.870
And then WebKit has this
awesome feature, maybe a bug,

00:48:25.870 --> 00:48:30.250
that there's no content security
policy on file, colon, slash,

00:48:30.250 --> 00:48:30.750
slash.

00:48:30.750 --> 00:48:32.610
So you can load anything
from any domain,

00:48:32.610 --> 00:48:34.990
which is kind of rad.

00:48:34.990 --> 00:48:37.570
In iOS8-- Marcos
talked about this--

00:48:37.570 --> 00:48:38.770
there's this new web view.

00:48:38.770 --> 00:48:41.699
And in iOS8 we can't load off,
file, colon, slash, slash.

00:48:41.699 --> 00:48:43.990
And it's a bug, and it's been
marked in radar as a bug.

00:48:43.990 --> 00:48:46.445
So Cordova's not going to get
to use the new WK webview.

00:48:46.445 --> 00:48:48.320
Or at least that's what
I think they thought,

00:48:48.320 --> 00:48:49.921
and we thought initially.

00:48:49.921 --> 00:48:51.420
We found that there's
a work around.

00:48:51.420 --> 00:48:53.560
And interestingly,
we've had this work

00:48:53.560 --> 00:48:55.910
around for awhile in
our Android world,

00:48:55.910 --> 00:48:58.449
where we run a web
server on the phone.

00:48:58.449 --> 00:49:00.990
I know everybody's like, what
the fuck are you talking about?

00:49:00.990 --> 00:49:03.040
Run a web server on your phone?

00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:03.620
It works.

00:49:03.620 --> 00:49:06.040
And so, we can load
off a local host.

00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:08.370
But now we're running a
full fledged web server

00:49:08.370 --> 00:49:10.840
as a part of our
app on the client.

00:49:10.840 --> 00:49:14.080
And that's got implications that
I totally don't understand yet.

00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:17.250
I know Opera did it first,
if there's an Opera guy here.

00:49:17.250 --> 00:49:20.462
But it's interesting.

00:49:20.462 --> 00:49:21.920
And so I don't know
where this goes

00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:23.711
but this changes the
whole offline question

00:49:23.711 --> 00:49:26.490
all together now, because now
I'm running a fully capable web

00:49:26.490 --> 00:49:28.520
server on the device as well.

00:49:28.520 --> 00:49:30.030
JAKE ARCHIBALD: It should
have just like a proxy server,

00:49:30.030 --> 00:49:31.810
and then you could have
called it Service Worker,

00:49:31.810 --> 00:49:33.393
and then we could
put it in a browser.

00:49:33.393 --> 00:49:34.060
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:34.060 --> 00:49:34.755
BRIAN LEROUX: Well,
Service Worker

00:49:34.755 --> 00:49:37.440
is kind of like a web server-ish
interface on a phone too.

00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:39.439
So we're entering
into this world

00:49:39.439 --> 00:49:40.980
where there's web
servers everywhere.

00:49:40.980 --> 00:49:42.960
Maybe we will have the
distributed computing

00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:43.545
thing happen.

00:49:46.784 --> 00:49:48.200
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
OK, next question.

00:49:48.200 --> 00:49:49.658
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:49.658 --> 00:49:51.830
BRIAN LEROUX: I really
killed the conversation.

00:49:51.830 --> 00:49:53.490
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Oh, no, it's
more the next question, not

00:49:53.490 --> 00:49:54.420
this question.

00:49:54.420 --> 00:49:56.640
So recently-- as comes
from Andrew Betts as well.

00:49:56.640 --> 00:49:58.150
Thanks Andrew.

00:49:58.150 --> 00:50:01.000
Recently Chrome experimented
with hiding the URL.

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:04.925
Is this another step in the
appification of the web?

00:50:04.925 --> 00:50:06.300
Yeah, because I
wrote a blog post

00:50:06.300 --> 00:50:09.490
about this when Chrome
has that experiment where

00:50:09.490 --> 00:50:10.570
they were hiding the URL.

00:50:10.570 --> 00:50:12.090
And it landed on Hacker News.

00:50:12.090 --> 00:50:14.810
And the internet fire
hose was pointed at me,

00:50:14.810 --> 00:50:16.140
and it was filled with fire.

00:50:16.140 --> 00:50:18.117
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:18.117 --> 00:50:19.450
It's a fun blog post to look at.

00:50:19.450 --> 00:50:22.372
So Chris, why does Google
hate the web so much?

00:50:22.372 --> 00:50:24.397
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:24.397 --> 00:50:25.980
I didn't like everybody
picking on you

00:50:25.980 --> 00:50:27.340
but I didn't want to show bias.

00:50:27.340 --> 00:50:29.757
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:29.757 --> 00:50:31.340
CHRIS WILSON: I think
you've succeeded

00:50:31.340 --> 00:50:35.570
in not showing
pro-Google bias in this.

00:50:35.570 --> 00:50:38.380
JAKE ARCHIBALD: So, but,
Brian, like the PhoneGap apps,

00:50:38.380 --> 00:50:39.220
they don't--

00:50:39.220 --> 00:50:40.970
BRIAN LEROUX: We don't
show half the URLs.

00:50:40.970 --> 00:50:42.290
JAKE ARCHIBALD: So URLs,
they're pointless right?

00:50:42.290 --> 00:50:43.070
They're dead?

00:50:43.070 --> 00:50:46.402
You hate URL's as well?

00:50:46.402 --> 00:50:48.110
BRIAN LEROUX: There's
problems with URLs.

00:50:48.110 --> 00:50:49.950
I can argue that.

00:50:49.950 --> 00:50:51.960
If you play with
Opera's coast browser--

00:50:51.960 --> 00:50:53.960
I don't know why I'm
giving Opera so many props,

00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:55.150
but whatever, they're good.

00:50:55.150 --> 00:50:55.610
MARCOS CACERES:
They do good work.

00:50:55.610 --> 00:50:56.250
BRIAN LEROUX: They do good work.

00:50:56.250 --> 00:50:58.080
So Opera's coast
browser has no URL

00:50:58.080 --> 00:51:01.190
and it's surprisingly nice to
navigate and play around with.

00:51:01.190 --> 00:51:04.240
And I totally recommend
checking it out.

00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:05.950
The URL is not going away.

00:51:05.950 --> 00:51:09.420
So that thing will
be there for awhile.

00:51:09.420 --> 00:51:11.370
Whether or not we have
to show that to a user

00:51:11.370 --> 00:51:13.654
is fully up for debate,
and it should be.

00:51:13.654 --> 00:51:16.070
Just because a URL is a great
idea, doesn't mean the users

00:51:16.070 --> 00:51:17.750
have to know that it's there.

00:51:17.750 --> 00:51:21.070
That's my belief on it,
but that's obviously

00:51:21.070 --> 00:51:23.170
firehouse material, so.

00:51:23.170 --> 00:51:25.045
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Matt,
you dealt with the web.

00:51:25.045 --> 00:51:27.935
So was the URL useful
to you still, in an app?

00:51:27.935 --> 00:51:29.030
A web app?

00:51:29.030 --> 00:51:30.540
MATT ANDREWS: From a technical
point of view it's useful.

00:51:30.540 --> 00:51:33.040
I just want to say that no
one complained-- well no one

00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:35.020
I saw complained
when Safari did this.

00:51:35.020 --> 00:51:38.624
It seems unfortunate that Chrome
get the front on the anger.

00:51:38.624 --> 00:51:40.040
CHRIS WILSON: It
does, doesn't it?

00:51:40.040 --> 00:51:41.000
Really does.

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:42.559
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:42.559 --> 00:51:44.350
MATT ANDREWS: But yeah,
we rely on the URL.

00:51:44.350 --> 00:51:47.302
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:52.580
Make Service Worker,
have 'em quickly.

00:51:52.580 --> 00:51:53.839
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:53.839 --> 00:51:54.880
CHRIS WILSON: Afterwards.

00:51:54.880 --> 00:51:56.489
You don't do it in
front of people.

00:51:56.489 --> 00:51:56.988
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:56.988 --> 00:51:59.220
JAKE ARCHIBALD: I've been
getting it all wrong.

00:51:59.220 --> 00:52:02.400
So with the BlackBerry, you guys
hide the URL as well, right?

00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:06.320
ELI FIDLER: We hide the URL
for sites that have SSL certs

00:52:06.320 --> 00:52:07.875
that we are very happy about.

00:52:07.875 --> 00:52:09.960
So if you have an ED cert
that we're happy about,

00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:13.958
we show you the issuer name.

00:52:13.958 --> 00:52:15.440
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
That makes sense.

00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:16.510
ELI FIDLER: So the
organization name.

00:52:16.510 --> 00:52:18.134
So, like, if you go
to Bank of America,

00:52:18.134 --> 00:52:20.839
you see Bank of America in
green with the lock icon.

00:52:20.839 --> 00:52:22.880
BRIAN LEROUX: I've never
been to a bank's website

00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:24.910
where I could read
the URL anyways.

00:52:24.910 --> 00:52:25.445
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:25.445 --> 00:52:27.517
It's like,
j-session-id, whatever.

00:52:27.517 --> 00:52:28.850
CHRIS WILSON: But see that's it.

00:52:28.850 --> 00:52:31.185
I think that in response
to what you were saying,

00:52:31.185 --> 00:52:33.310
you were saying you don't
think URLs are going away

00:52:33.310 --> 00:52:34.421
anytime soon.

00:52:34.421 --> 00:52:36.420
I don't think they're
ever going away on the web

00:52:36.420 --> 00:52:39.060
because I feel that's
fundamental to what the web is.

00:52:39.060 --> 00:52:40.970
It's like, linkable URLs.

00:52:40.970 --> 00:52:45.640
But at the same time, the idea
that you can sanely read a URL,

00:52:45.640 --> 00:52:47.040
that time is gone.

00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:49.190
That time's been gone
for a decade or more

00:52:49.190 --> 00:52:50.920
at this point at least.

00:52:50.920 --> 00:52:54.377
And it is all junk in there
and you shouldn't read it,

00:52:54.377 --> 00:52:56.460
but it's still an identifier,
it's still something

00:52:56.460 --> 00:53:02.050
that-- I feel like in how I
internalized the UI of a web

00:53:02.050 --> 00:53:04.600
application, that's
just a little marker

00:53:04.600 --> 00:53:06.860
and it's totally opaque.

00:53:06.860 --> 00:53:08.892
It's a token identifier.

00:53:08.892 --> 00:53:10.350
It's a button that
I want to press,

00:53:10.350 --> 00:53:12.630
or something, to go back to it.

00:53:12.630 --> 00:53:15.070
But it's not actually
something I really need to see.

00:53:15.070 --> 00:53:16.695
BRIAN LEROUX: We keep
getting attracted

00:53:16.695 --> 00:53:18.790
to this idea of human readable.

00:53:18.790 --> 00:53:21.510
Remember when people said
XML is human readable?

00:53:21.510 --> 00:53:22.510
People used to say that.

00:53:22.510 --> 00:53:25.009
And then they started saying,
no, that's not human readable,

00:53:25.009 --> 00:53:25.580
JSON is.

00:53:25.580 --> 00:53:27.537
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:27.537 --> 00:53:29.370
CHRIS WILSON: You didn't
sit down last night

00:53:29.370 --> 00:53:31.371
with a big tome of XML
and just read it for fun?

00:53:31.371 --> 00:53:32.911
BRIAN LEROUX: Just
paging through it.

00:53:32.911 --> 00:53:34.250
God, this is beautiful.

00:53:34.250 --> 00:53:36.920
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Andrew's holding
a microphone, looking eager.

00:53:36.920 --> 00:53:38.795
ANDREW BETTS: So one of
the biggest arguments

00:53:38.795 --> 00:53:40.940
for the hiding of the URL
is the phishing thing.

00:53:40.940 --> 00:53:43.592
You know, that you want to
avoid users being phished

00:53:43.592 --> 00:53:45.050
by hiding the bit
of the URL that's

00:53:45.050 --> 00:53:48.545
least important in identifying
that the site is safe.

00:53:48.545 --> 00:53:50.170
And I think one of
the biggest problems

00:53:50.170 --> 00:53:52.830
with that is that it
doesn't actually work.

00:53:52.830 --> 00:53:56.350
Because you have a phone
that is small enough

00:53:56.350 --> 00:53:58.680
that it can only display
part of the host name.

00:53:58.680 --> 00:54:00.530
So what you've got
to do is register

00:54:00.530 --> 00:54:04.400
an evil dot com--
and evil dot come

00:54:04.400 --> 00:54:06.090
which has a subdomain
that looks legit

00:54:06.090 --> 00:54:07.880
and that has the same
prefix as the one

00:54:07.880 --> 00:54:09.580
that you were going
to log into anyway.

00:54:09.580 --> 00:54:12.130
So, I guess I don't
buy it, because I just

00:54:12.130 --> 00:54:14.857
don't see that the
benefit actually exists.

00:54:14.857 --> 00:54:17.190
CHRIS WILSON: I mean, this
is kind of what I was saying.

00:54:17.190 --> 00:54:22.000
It's like I need to know that
that token is mostly right.

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:24.910
Like if I'm going to
my bank's website,

00:54:24.910 --> 00:54:28.420
if I know that it says HTTPS
colon, wack, wack, www,

00:54:28.420 --> 00:54:31.100
dot Bank of America dot
com, and it's all green,

00:54:31.100 --> 00:54:35.060
and it's got the Bank of America
cert on it and everything,

00:54:35.060 --> 00:54:36.630
it's likely OK.

00:54:36.630 --> 00:54:38.770
But if I don't
see the URL today,

00:54:38.770 --> 00:54:41.300
how do I know that's
where it's going?

00:54:41.300 --> 00:54:44.680
How do I know it's not going to
evil dot-- or Bank of America

00:54:44.680 --> 00:54:47.202
dot, blah, blah, blah,
dot evil dot com?

00:54:47.202 --> 00:54:49.160
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Can I
get Charles a microphone?

00:54:49.160 --> 00:54:50.210
Where are you?

00:54:50.210 --> 00:54:51.160
Hand up?

00:54:55.910 --> 00:54:57.820
CHARLES: Hey.

00:54:57.820 --> 00:55:00.005
Oh, wow, that's very loud.

00:55:00.005 --> 00:55:03.650
So we've been talking a
little bit about permissions,

00:55:03.650 --> 00:55:04.400
about installable.

00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:06.920
I know that we've got a question
coming about fragmentation,

00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:10.980
what happens if we start doing
application installation, how

00:55:10.980 --> 00:55:13.456
that potentially
fragments the web.

00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:17.780
OK.

00:55:17.780 --> 00:55:19.570
No, that's on me.

00:55:19.570 --> 00:55:26.220
So I'm thinking about
hiding URL here.

00:55:26.220 --> 00:55:31.130
What happens if we look at
browser vendors as app stores?

00:55:31.130 --> 00:55:34.490
And is that a future
that is scary to us?

00:55:34.490 --> 00:55:38.620
Having them sort of be trusted
authority on permissions?

00:55:38.620 --> 00:55:40.850
On all of those
things that occur

00:55:40.850 --> 00:55:43.249
when we install an application.

00:55:43.249 --> 00:55:45.790
If that happens in the future,
is that scary or is that good?

00:55:45.790 --> 00:55:47.470
BRIAN LEROUX: It's happening.

00:55:47.470 --> 00:55:48.867
I mean it's already--

00:55:48.867 --> 00:55:51.450
CHRIS WILSON: --Chrome Web Store
has kind of got, for example.

00:55:51.450 --> 00:55:54.440
But I'm not sure that's the
model that we really want.

00:55:54.440 --> 00:55:57.560
I mean I work on a
browser, I've worked

00:55:57.560 --> 00:56:00.960
on other browsers in the past
and I still like the fact

00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:02.590
that they're somewhat
interchangeable.

00:56:02.590 --> 00:56:03.110
Right?

00:56:03.110 --> 00:56:07.880
I don't actually have a boatload
of Chrome Web apps installed

00:56:07.880 --> 00:56:11.690
on my machines because I
like the fact that I can use

00:56:11.690 --> 00:56:14.790
the web, and I can use
something that's like an app,

00:56:14.790 --> 00:56:16.620
but I don't have to
install something

00:56:16.620 --> 00:56:19.910
that doesn't work
if I go to my iPad

00:56:19.910 --> 00:56:23.784
and I don't have all
of that browser there.

00:56:23.784 --> 00:56:25.200
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
We also, as people

00:56:25.200 --> 00:56:28.910
who work on browsers
and developers,

00:56:28.910 --> 00:56:31.880
Are we all agreed to
the open web thing?

00:56:31.880 --> 00:56:35.520
This idea of vendors
controlling which

00:56:35.520 --> 00:56:36.970
things appear in an app store.

00:56:36.970 --> 00:56:38.886
We're all committed to
never doing-- or trying

00:56:38.886 --> 00:56:41.090
to rid the world of that, yeah?

00:56:41.090 --> 00:56:43.000
BRIAN LEROUX: I'm warming to it.

00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:44.920
And not to the current model.

00:56:44.920 --> 00:56:46.770
So I don't think,
for example, there

00:56:46.770 --> 00:56:49.207
should be these
singular app stores.

00:56:49.207 --> 00:56:50.790
But I'm warming to
the idea that there

00:56:50.790 --> 00:56:52.170
should be many app stores.

00:56:52.170 --> 00:56:54.740
Like Mozilla experimented
with the idea of federating--

00:56:54.740 --> 00:56:55.200
CHRIS WILSON: Yeah, absolutely.

00:56:55.200 --> 00:56:57.330
Like, many app stores,
I could get behind.

00:56:57.330 --> 00:56:59.820
Although it becomes
challenging to secure that.

00:56:59.820 --> 00:57:01.819
BRIAN LEROUX: It's terrible
that, for example, I

00:57:01.819 --> 00:57:02.610
trust Steam.

00:57:02.610 --> 00:57:03.760
I trust 'em.

00:57:03.760 --> 00:57:05.390
They have games, right?

00:57:05.390 --> 00:57:07.954
And I know what kind of
permissions those games need.

00:57:07.954 --> 00:57:10.120
They need full screen and
they need audio, whatever.

00:57:10.120 --> 00:57:12.850
And so I would totally
trust a Steam app store

00:57:12.850 --> 00:57:14.540
on any of my devices.

00:57:14.540 --> 00:57:17.340
And I think that's kind of
direction we're going now.

00:57:17.340 --> 00:57:20.140
Can we standardize,
federate, and open

00:57:20.140 --> 00:57:21.675
that part up is
the real question.

00:57:21.675 --> 00:57:23.990
And then what does
become of the web then?

00:57:23.990 --> 00:57:27.220
I think the web community
is afraid of app stores,

00:57:27.220 --> 00:57:29.670
rightfully, because they're
currently curation points that

00:57:29.670 --> 00:57:31.970
are centralized and
dangerous and kind of weird,

00:57:31.970 --> 00:57:33.890
because your have
Steve Jobs deciding

00:57:33.890 --> 00:57:35.480
what's appropriate content.

00:57:35.480 --> 00:57:39.224
And he's not alive anymore,
so how's that possible?

00:57:39.224 --> 00:57:40.890
JAKE ARCHIBALD: And
with that we are out

00:57:40.890 --> 00:57:42.306
of time for the
session, but we'll

00:57:42.306 --> 00:57:45.800
be able to continue discussions
in the breakout sessions later.

00:57:45.800 --> 00:57:48.947
I'd like to thank
all the panelists.

00:57:48.947 --> 00:57:50.280
It's been scary and interesting.

00:57:50.280 --> 00:57:52.080
[LAUGHTER]

00:57:52.080 --> 00:57:55.730
[APPLAUSE]
