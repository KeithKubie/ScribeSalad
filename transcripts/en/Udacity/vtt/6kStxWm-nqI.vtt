00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
In question 3 I'd like to quiz your intuition.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Suppose we run a particle filter with N equals 1 particle.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
What will happen?

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
It'll work just fine, perhaps with a slightly larger error.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
It ignores robot measurements.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
It ignores robot motion.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
It likely fails.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Or none of the above.

00:00:21.000 --> 09:59:59.000
You can check multiple boxes on the left.
