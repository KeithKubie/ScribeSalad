00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.470
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:15.200
JASON SILVA: Now I'm
fascinated by airplanes.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.060
Aviation is an
engineering miracle,

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.920
a form of divine engineering.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.590
Alain de Botton
beautifully talked

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.710
about the awe-inspiring
rapture one

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.430
feels when one bears witness
to the power of a jet engine,

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.010
to the power of
a flying machine.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.900
And I remember the first I
saw the A380 this hit me home.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.240
But Alain de Botton
says nothing prepares

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.570
you or the sense of
agility and self-possession

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.160
of a jet airplane.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.790
No structure of compare
the size-- a building

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:48.180
or a cathedral-- can compare
to that feeling of freedom,

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.830
of exhilaration that
machine promises.

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.670
He talks about walking through
a corridor that will lead you

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.760
onto a craft that will
take you somewhere

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.520
where no one knows your name.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.860
It becomes a kind of
ontological journey.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.380
It becomes a journey
of self-realization,

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:04.510
of soaring above ones limits.

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.860
The jet airplane
literalizes the human goal

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.640
of transcending our limitation.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.290
It's always a symbolic journey.

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.570
Airlines don't realize this.

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.000
People talk about how the
enchantment of flying,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.160
the magic of flying, has faded.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.880
And people are so bored.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.680
Because they're
closing their windows.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:23.840
They're afraid to look out.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.150
They're afraid to bear
witness to what is possible.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.650
Look at the appeal of those
screens in the airports

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.830
with the promise of destinations
of spaces of happiness,

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.990
places where the
answers might lie.

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.465
Alain de Botton
beautifully talks about it.

00:01:37.465 --> 00:01:40.680
Thing of the imaginative
allure or Paris,

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.360
of Amsterdam, of the Czech
Republic, of Cape Town.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.890
On my god these places sing.

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:47.980
They sing to us.

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:49.300
They beckon.

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.126
This is the power of these
transcendent machines.

00:01:52.126 --> 00:01:55.894
And we need to just open
our eyes a little bit.

00:01:55.894 --> 00:01:59.180
This is a daily reminder
every day of what's possible.

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.632
This is who we are.

00:02:00.632 --> 00:02:04.020
These are our technological
skins, our scaffoldings.

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.960
We have wings, people.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.539
We may be flawed
stumbling primates.

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.695
But when we work together we
are primates that can fly.

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:20.130
Hey guys, you want to take
a look at Shots of Awe

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.690
behind the scenes, how
it all comes to life?

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.340
Well then check
out this episode I

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.220
shot on Seeker Stories, which
explores my daily rituals

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.470
and how we make Shots of Awe.
