00:00:02.679 --> 00:00:12.340
&gt;&gt;Commentator: We're really excited today
to have Judith Jones, fabulous editor and

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:47.410
author be with us today. She's gonna share
with you her latest cookbook, 'The Pleasures

00:00:47.410 --> 00:01:06.560
of Cooking for One' and then you can ask her
any question you might have on your mind.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.470
So please give her a welcome.

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:10.470
[pause]

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.470
&gt;&gt;Judith Jones: [unintelligible] Got it.

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:12.470
[laughter]

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:13.470
Word of honor. [laughs]

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.470
[pause]

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:15.470
Get in my high chair.

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:16.470
[laughter]

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:17.470
Well you might all ask why a book on cooking
for one. Some people just get a glazed look

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:18.470
in their eyes and say, "All that fuss just
for me. I don't wanna do that."

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:26.201
But I think there are many, many others who
realize that it's more than just cutting down

00:01:26.201 --> 00:01:35.010
recipes. It's a whole strategy that you -- that
you've got to make work for yourself. And

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:40.799
once, once you have it in hand I think you'll
find that just going home at the end of the

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:47.909
day and lighting the stove and getting the
garlic sizzling and filling the house with

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:53.759
good smells, that there's something so satisfying
about it.

00:01:53.759 --> 00:02:04.009
And I talked a little bit about in my memoir,
'The Tenth Muse' about, about this at the

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:10.229
end of the book after my husband died because
I felt, "I'm not gonna wanna do it just myself.

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.965
It's going to be depressing and too many memories"
and he was a great cook and we cooked together.

00:02:14.965 --> 00:02:22.299
But it was quite, I found it was quite the
opposite. I found that by honoring myself

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:29.150
and making a ritual of, of a nice dinner every
night, lighting the candles, turning on some

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.409
music, giving thanks, that it -- something
in me responded to this.

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:42.129
And I think you'll, you'll really find that
so. That's what I wanna try to convey.

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:48.329
There have been a number of books about cooking
for one, but mostly they're just a reduced

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:51.449
recipe and, as I say, it's strategy.

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:58.269
Now in the first place you don't think one
dish at a time. You think of one dish leading

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:03.589
to another; it's a rhythm through the week.
Think how many times you're gonna be home

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:08.980
and if you bought that little tenderloin of
pork, how many times would you use it in quite

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.120
different ways so you're not eating cold pork
all week?

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:20.709
And all, all meats and fish that lend themselves
to, to flavoring in different ways so they,

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.199
they don't taste the same on the second round
or the third round.

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:30.269
Note I don't use leftovers 'cause, the word
leftovers 'cause that puts people off. Second

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:33.239
round, third round, reincarnation [laughs]

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:34.239
[laughter]

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:42.620
I think that, that, is kind of the attitude
to have. And so you think through the week

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:52.579
and you, you try to, to keep things varied
if you have just that extra little piece of

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:58.680
meat on your plate and you really don't want
it, incorporate in a nice little salad you're

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.480
making for lunch the next day to take to work.

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:07.549
Now you don't have to because you have a wonderful
cafeteria, but I can tell you the Knopf Cafeteria

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:10.269
makes you wanna bring your own lunch. [laughs]

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:11.269
[laughter]

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:15.389
So I almost invariably do unless I'm going
out and that's part of it too.

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:24.069
And it's, in a curious way you don't overstuff
that because you eat what you want and you

00:04:24.069 --> 00:04:29.060
put the other thing aside already beginning
to think of "What am I going to do with that?"

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:35.560
My children used to laugh at me and say, "You're
no sooner you and, you and Evan are no sooner

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.490
finished one meal then you're thinking of
the next.

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:48.430
Well, it leads to that because it is a very
creative pleasure. It isn't just following

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:53.870
slavishly a recipe, but looking in the fridge,
seeing what you have, seeing what you have

00:04:53.870 --> 00:05:01.199
in your freezer, what needs using up, what
combinations would be good and then really

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:07.440
creating something out of those little tidbits,
I call them gold, in the refrigerator. "Cause

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.530
it's like, it's like having treasure.

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.460
You learn ways not to waste. Now for instance
you have to a get a whole box of mushrooms.

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:19.479
You don't wanna eat mushrooms three times
or four times in one week; so after the second

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:28.300
or third day and they're beginning to look
a little droopy, chop them up, put 'em in

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:32.240
a small pan with some butter, just enough
to get the, the juice out of them and then

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:38.409
put them in a little plastic bag, sealed.
And there you have what the French call Mushroom

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:39.409
Duxelle.

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:44.490
And you can take a little, break off a piece
and put it in a soup, you can put it in an

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:50.260
omelet; anything that needs seasoning. So
your imagination starts going. That's part

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:55.389
of it and then I think having some things,
basic things on hand.

00:05:55.389 --> 00:06:02.610
When I make a tomato sauce I make probably
three times as much as I need and put it in

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:05.379
small containers; same with the cream sauce.

00:06:05.379 --> 00:06:14.281
I've devised a way now when I have a, a chicken
stock or even if it's a canned stock, you

00:06:14.281 --> 00:06:21.220
know you open it and may be use a half a cup
in your sauce and the rest goes to waste.

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:27.389
Put it in an ice tray and then let it freeze,
and then break up the cubes and put them in

00:06:27.389 --> 00:06:32.150
little plastic containers; and that way you
can just pull out one cube and plop it into

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:36.949
your, into your frying pan, and make a little
pan sauce.

00:06:36.949 --> 00:06:44.710
So I'm having fun as I'm doing this because
it, it gets your mind sort of spinning. If

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:48.310
you make a dreadful mistake, you have only
yourself to -

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:49.310
[laughter]

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:51.039
you eat it anyway. [laughs]

00:06:51.039 --> 00:06:52.039
[laughter]

00:06:52.039 --> 00:06:57.319
So what if the sauce curdled? And you learn
something from it so that next time you're

00:06:57.319 --> 00:07:04.780
a little more careful with the flame or you
don't put ice cold milk in and it's that kind

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:06.189
of thing.

00:07:06.189 --> 00:07:14.240
Also the other positive things are that, that
it's much less expensive. You can buy a whole

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:18.870
little chicken and you can, you use it probably
in five or six ways.

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:24.160
I always go in and get the, the packet of
giblets 'cause I love a chicken liver and

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:29.050
make a little shirred egg and chicken liver
lunch for myself.

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:34.830
And there's the neck and the giblets and you,
 -- I either freeze them until I have a big

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:41.150
pot of them or if I need just a little bit
of broth, put that in a pot and boil it up;

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:45.740
and then you have some cold chicken for lunch
and then you can make some of those wonderful

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:48.939
old fashioned dishes, I think of them.

00:07:48.939 --> 00:07:54.699
One is just minced chicken on toast with nice
flavors in it; some cream and maybe some Madeira

00:07:54.699 --> 00:08:05.080
and some shallots and a little herbs. And
it's so simple. Or you can have fun and make

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:06.659
yourself [ ].

00:08:06.659 --> 00:08:12.400
I remember there was a restaurant called The
Chicken Divan. No, the restaurant was called

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:18.520
The Divan when I was growing up and one of
their specialties was a chicken Divan which

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:25.919
was broccoli on the bottom of a dish and then
a lovely cream sauce on the chicken and parmesan

00:08:25.919 --> 00:08:27.060
cheese and baked all together.

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:32.790
And that's very easy to make if you've got
a piece of leftover chicken and your cream

00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:38.360
sauce is in the fridge. You have that ready
in 10 minutes. And then bake it.

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:46.180
So that, that, that is a large part of the
fun too of, of feeling, "Well, I've probably

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:51.639
spent half of what my neighbor's spending
with that take out that she's eating."

00:08:51.639 --> 00:09:00.300
And also, and I think this is a, a very important
factor, we're much more aware today of where

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:09.350
our food comes from and we care about it.
And we can take that little extra to buy something

00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:17.769
organic and we don't have to eat things that
we don't know what's in them; all those ersatz

00:09:17.769 --> 00:09:20.639
products and corn oil and stuff like that.

00:09:20.639 --> 00:09:26.790
We're in charge of what we're eating and that
gives you a very, very good feeling. And it's

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:35.250
fun to go to farmer's markets and to stop
at some of the, the little stands all through

00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:40.149
Manhattan; get to know; they see me coming
and they say, "Oh you want your blueberries"

00:09:40.149 --> 00:09:43.990
or and my bananas or -

00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:51.490
And it, supermarkets have become so lifeless;
nobody talks to you. I mean you don't have

00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:57.230
that connection. So it's us to cultivate that
and feel that even when you're in New York

00:09:57.230 --> 00:10:04.620
that you are in touch with, with the things
of the earth even when you're up on the ninth

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:05.620
floor. [laughs]

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:06.620
[laughter]

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:14.550
And so those, those, those are all some of
the, the, the pleasures that I find and in

00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:18.360
doing this book, I wanted to make it very
personal.

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:26.420
I think that when you're in the kitchen, particularly
a young person starting out for the first

00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:35.360
time, and most of us haven't learned at Grandma's
knee the way we used to in the past, and so

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:41.570
you need, you need to feel somebody's there
with you. And so I wanted that sense of a

00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:42.970
voice in the kitchen.

00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:49.070
And we don't have to be so compulsively fussy.
We've gone too far in that direction. I mean

00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:56.820
recipes talk about in a bowl combine the first
mixture with the second mixture - we don't

00:10:56.820 --> 00:11:00.139
call things what they are. I'd really, the
first time I came upon that I thought, "What's

00:11:00.139 --> 00:11:08.981
my mixture?" And I looked, and up in the first
paragraph Step, 1, 2, 3, 4; you don't cook

00:11:08.981 --> 00:11:10.520
that way.

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:16.500
I saw that the milk had been heated with a
little sugar so that becomes the first mixture?

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:23.350
I mean it, I wanna bring back into cookbooks
that sense of there's a person there who's

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:27.270
loving what she's doing and wants to share
it with you and you can talk back to her it

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:28.270
if doesn't work.

00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:36.920
And so we had a lot of fun putting this together
and when we were thinking about the cover,

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:42.649
unfortunately I'm an editor at Knopf, and
also published by them, so I'm right on the

00:11:42.649 --> 00:11:48.829
inside of things and can have a say in what
the cover should look like and the design.

00:11:48.829 --> 00:11:57.120
But I, I was having lunch across the street
at a new restaurant that had opened and it

00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:04.360
had a cheese soufflé; you don't see that
very often; 25 minute wait, but I had a chatty

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:06.639
author with me and the 25 minutes flew.

00:12:06.639 --> 00:12:12.649
And in came this perfect little for one soufflé;
it was delicious. I was so excited by it;

00:12:12.649 --> 00:12:19.120
I thought that's the cover. Because to me
it expresses everything I would want to set

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:24.480
it up. Pleasing yourself, making something
that's good to look at, delicious to eat,

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:28.980
putting to use some of these principles of,
I mean the cream sauce that I needed was right

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:34.720
in the, right in the freezer. And so we put,
we put that on the cover.

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:42.709
And then the young designer asked what this
background material was. And I said, "Well

00:12:42.709 --> 00:12:51.500
it's just a kitchen towel, I have." She said,
"Bring it in." And so we have to get rid of

00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:52.500
this and this -

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:58.730
[pause]

00:12:58.730 --> 00:13:09.160
So she took the towel and used it for the
oldest ancillary material I'm telling, I'm

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:14.310
telling you about how, how to use up your
cheeses; how to buy them; how to keep them;

00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:18.840
how to use up milk because you have to get
a whole quart of milk when all you want is

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:20.040
half a pint.

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:30.709
And incidentally I, I think I'm gonna start
a movement called 'Remember the Solos' or

00:13:30.709 --> 00:13:33.360
'Remember The Single Cook' or something like
that.

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:34.360
[laughter]

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:39.410
And I once talked to a supermarket and I said,
"Why don't you just think of that single cook

00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:45.660
and, and you could have a sticker on the outside
of your store saying, "We Cater To Singles."

00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:47.279
I said, "You'd be inundated."

00:13:47.279 --> 00:13:48.279
[laughter]

00:13:48.279 --> 00:13:52.959
But they don't talk, they'd, they'd rather
have us waste food so you do buy too much

00:13:52.959 --> 00:13:54.870
and so you have to think another way.

00:13:54.870 --> 00:14:04.190
But to go back to this book. I also wanted
to kind of tell a few stories because I think

00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:08.269
there's always a story in a recipe; it's always
where it came from and I'll just read you

00:14:08.269 --> 00:14:11.120
one of these because -

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:13.890
[long pause]

00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:24.670
"Once when I was up in Cambridge, Massachusetts
working all day non-stop with Julia Child,

00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:33.820
as we often did, it was almost 11 p.m. when
she finally swept away the manuscript and

00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:34.820
announced, 'We'll make dinner.'

00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:35.820
[laughter]

00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:38.810
And she turned to me and said, 'Judith, you
make a nice little potato dish while I fix

00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:44.740
the meat.' Slightly unnerved I managed to
give rise to the occasion and put together

00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:51.980
what I would call a fast stove top version
of the classic Potatoes Anna.

00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:56.160
As I mashed some garlic and salt together
and smeared this between the layers of the

00:14:56.160 --> 00:15:02.190
sliced potatoes, Julia was looking on a bit
skeptically and although I used lots of butter

00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:07.459
 - of which she always approved - it wasn't
clarified butter.

00:15:07.459 --> 00:15:12.750
But when we sat down and she took her first
bite, she pronounced the potatoes delicious

00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:18.000
and her husband Paul toasted me. I was in
cook's heaven."

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.000
[laughter]

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:24.850
So it's, it's dispersed with stories because
I think that way you get to know the person

00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:34.610
who's guiding you and I guess that's, gives
you a sort of feeling of the book and the

00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:38.240
impulse behind it and I just hope you all
have fun with it.

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:40.460
But have you got some questions?

00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:41.670
[pause]

00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:48.990
Oh you must have some questions.

00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:50.209
[pause]

00:15:50.209 --> 00:16:00.490
&gt;&gt;Q: Hi there. Thank you so much for coming,
especially given the weather. But I was wondering

00:16:00.490 --> 00:16:07.060
if in general, I've been told that sometimes
if you wanna cook for one and take a recipe

00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:11.639
that was designed for four, that you could,
you really can't just quarter it, is that

00:16:11.639 --> 00:16:12.639
true?

00:16:12.639 --> 00:16:13.639
&gt;&gt;Judith Jones: I'm, I'm not following that
too well.

00:16:13.639 --> 00:16:18.120
&gt;&gt;Q: If I wanted to take a recipe that was
designed for more than one person -

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:19.120
&gt;&gt;Judith Jones: Okay, yeah. Uh-hum.

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:23.140
&gt;&gt;Q: and make it for one, can I just half
it or quarter it, or are there some things

00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:24.190
that don't translate?

00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:29.089
&gt;&gt;Judith Jones: Yes, if you remember to half
and quarter the pan too.

00:16:29.089 --> 00:16:30.089
[laughter]

00:16:30.089 --> 00:16:31.089
You see what I mean?

00:16:31.089 --> 00:16:32.089
&gt;&gt;Q: Uh-hum.

00:16:32.089 --> 00:16:35.540
&gt;&gt;Judith Jones: I remember I did one of Lidia
Bastianich's dishes and I told her about it.

00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:40.759
And she said, "Oh, but you, that wouldn't
be any good for one because you, you would,

00:16:40.759 --> 00:16:42.730
all the liquid would boil away."

00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:49.129
Well I did it in a small one portion pan and
the liquid didn't all disappear. You have

00:16:49.129 --> 00:16:56.430
to adjust just a little bit. Watch it. And
I kinda keep notes, but that's the, the basic

00:16:56.430 --> 00:17:03.870
principle to use the right size utensil for
the amount, the recipe you're cutting down.

00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:04.870
&gt;&gt;Q: Thank you.

00:17:04.870 --> 00:17:10.721
&gt;&gt;Q: Hi, I just wanted to know if you had
like a favorite recipe or is there something

00:17:10.721 --> 00:17:13.260
in particular that you really enjoy cooking.

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:14.940
&gt;&gt;Judith Jones: A favorite recipe?

00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:19.980
&gt;&gt;Q: Yeah, favorite recipe in your book. Do
you, is there, do you really like cooking

00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:22.340
fish versus chicken and do you have a favorite
recipe?

00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:26.060
&gt;&gt;Judith Jones: Well, I really only did recipes
that I love.

00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:27.060
[laughter]

00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:36.951
And it's hard to say a favorite. For one thing
I'm always working with new authors and I

00:17:36.951 --> 00:17:43.500
learn from them, so I want to experiment with
that and right now my recipes I love the most

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:48.600
are ones I'm doing of Madhur Jaffrey who has
a book coming in the fall on Indian cooking

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:55.410
that she's really simplified so that it's
much easier for you and me to do it.

00:17:55.410 --> 00:18:03.290
Having said that, I do sometimes get a yen
for something. And this happened with popovers.

00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:09.080
And I thought, "You know I can't make a whole
pan full of popover's, they don't, they don't

00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:15.140
keep, I mean they collapse out of - you have
to eat them hot from the oven."

00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:23.180
And then I, I remembered this popover pan
that has separate units so that they don't

00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:30.820
steam, but the air in the oven circulates.
And so I got myself those popovers pans and

00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:38.460
I cut down the recipe so that, I think I made
just two. And that was so exciting. Just the

00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:44.130
taste of the popover; and memories of childhood.
I think we're very attached to things we ate

00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:51.970
as children and, and I've learned another
trick that, if you cut a slice in them so

00:18:51.970 --> 00:18:59.240
they do deflate at least they aren't soggy
and you can warm the second, or the leftover

00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:01.590
one in the oven the next day and it's pretty
good.

00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:19.860
So you, you constantly find a way and you
feel so proud of yourself.

00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:20.860
[laughter]

00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:21.860
[pause]

00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:23.190
&gt;&gt;Q: Thank you for coming. I would just love
to hear a little bit about your history and

00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:29.160
your journey and kind of where you are today
versus, how you fell in love with cooking

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:30.760
and a little bit about that. That'd be great.

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:35.910
&gt;&gt;Judith Jones: Yeah. I will. I, it's, it's,
it's kind of all in the, the first book, 'The

00:19:35.910 --> 00:19:42.370
Tenth Muse, My Life In Food', so I didn't
repeat that here.

00:19:42.370 --> 00:19:49.400
But I don't know, I think I was born with
the right genes, I always just loved gravitating

00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:58.160
to the kitchen and watching our cook Edie
with a big ceramic bowl and a wooden spoon.

00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:05.330
I can still hear the plop of that cake batter
as she beat it in the big bowl and I would

00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:10.750
ask her questions about what she ate when
she, what she served her boyfriend over the

00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:13.680
weekend when she went back to Harlem.

00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:23.680
And I mean it, it seemed, it seemed a whole
world out there because our cooking was pretty,

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:28.960
pretty good straightforward plain English
cooking; no garlic. [laughs]

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:29.960
[laughter]

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:35.090
So, but I, I just had this in my genes. I
loved to cook for my dog when I was a little

00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:37.640
girl too. That's before we had canned dog
food.

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:48.970
And so I pursued this and was, went to Paris
when I was 24 years old, just on a summer

00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:56.170
holiday because I wanted perhaps a bubble.
And I stayed instead of three weeks, I stayed

00:20:56.170 --> 00:21:00.570
for three and a half years. And, and that's
a whole story in itself.

00:21:00.570 --> 00:21:05.790
But I tried different things. I even had a
French boyfriend who helped this one little

00:21:05.790 --> 00:21:10.530
restaurant in the Countesses apartment and
had all kinds of adventures.

00:21:10.530 --> 00:21:17.450
But most of all what I learned was how food
is such a part of French life and what a good

00:21:17.450 --> 00:21:23.350
time they have with it. Now they talk about
it and take the whole family to the market

00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:30.460
and go to the charcuterie for this and the
patisserie for this the boulangerie for this

00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:37.530
and the time is, is time spent on something
they love. So that it, it, it was a revelation

00:21:37.530 --> 00:21:38.530
to me.

00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:48.100
And when I came back, which was 1951, it seemed
sort of a wasteland here. I mean we didn't

00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:57.650
have even fresh mushrooms, fresh herbs in
our supermarkets and the, the garlic you could

00:21:57.650 --> 00:22:03.330
get came in a little box; little desiccated
cloves as though it mustn't touch anything

00:22:03.330 --> 00:22:04.330
else. [laughs]

00:22:04.330 --> 00:22:05.330
[laughter]

00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:12.080
And I, I just found it hard and there, there
wasn't a book that really taught me. I had

00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:15.830
learned from asking, asking questions and
trial and error.

00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:22.790
But I really wanted to get into it and preserve
those good French dishes and fortunately I

00:22:22.790 --> 00:22:29.380
had just been about a year at Knopf and I
was working mostly on French translations,

00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:34.791
and along came this huge tome which turned
out to be 'Mastering the Art of French Cooking'.

00:22:34.791 --> 00:22:41.360
And it was as though it had been written for
me. I felt it was just an answer to my prayers.

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:43.860
Here it was; all of it.

00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:51.980
So I had to convince Knopf. But fortunately
old Mr. Knopf was a, he was a wine and food

00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:58.180
society kind of food connoisseur; never go
in the kitchen, but you, you appreciate from

00:22:58.180 --> 00:22:59.180
outside.

00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:09.070
And I think he just finally ended up let Mrs.
Jones have her chance and it was, the rest

00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:15.650
is history; Julia got on. I mean the book
was very, very well received, but it was when

00:23:15.650 --> 00:23:19.080
she got on television and she was such a natural.

00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:27.020
And I think she just awakened America to the
pleasures of cooking and to get rid of all

00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:34.640
that sort of Puritan ethic and enjoy slapping
the little chicken. Somebody asked her why

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:40.460
she massaged the chicken and she said, "Well,
I think he likes it." [laughs]

00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:41.530
[laughter]

00:23:41.530 --> 00:23:48.270
And she's so spontaneous and fun. It was,
it was magical; it just caught fire. And isn't

00:23:48.270 --> 00:23:53.870
it interesting that with this film 'Julie
and Julia', it's catching fire again.

00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:59.440
We have sold so many copies of 'Mastering
the Art' since that movie came out.

00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:05.190
So good things happen; you just wait long
enough. But I felt if Julia does this for

00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:12.790
French cooking I wanna find somebody who can
teach us Middle Eastern cooking, Chinese cooking,

00:24:12.790 --> 00:24:15.500
Spanish cooking, Indian cooking.

00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:23.950
So I really went in search of new writers
who, and very often they were women who had,

00:24:23.950 --> 00:24:29.760
had to leave their homeland when they were
young and were deeply attached to the roots,

00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:34.040
wanted that connection through food and wrote
so beautifully about it.

00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:41.690
And so I, that's how it all developed. [laughs]
And I could go on and on, but that's, that's

00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:49.130
enough of a, of an outline at least.

00:24:49.130 --> 00:24:50.750
[pause]

00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:55.610
&gt;&gt;Commentator: Somebody else?

00:24:55.610 --> 00:25:00.470
&gt;&gt;unidentified voice: Yes.

00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:02.090
[pause]

00:25:02.090 --> 00:25:09.050
&gt;&gt;Q: Can you talk a little bit more about
your relationship with Julia Child and some

00:25:09.050 --> 00:25:10.700
more interesting stories?

00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:11.700
[laughter]

00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:15.540
&gt;&gt;Judith Jones: About my, my relationship
with her or my, my working with her?

00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:16.540
&gt;&gt;Q: Uh-hum.

00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:22.180
&gt;&gt;Judith Jones: Yeah. Yeah. Well it's interesting
because probably most of you have seen 'Julie

00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:28.470
and Julia' and I think Meryl Streep gives
a wonderful portrayal of that lust for life

00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:36.630
and the pleasure and all of that and the very,
very intimate and supportive relationship

00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:39.470
with Paul, her husband.

00:25:39.470 --> 00:25:46.140
But I think there's one thing missing and
that is that Julia was absolutely dedicated

00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:49.530
to making Americans cook better [laughs]

00:25:49.530 --> 00:25:50.530
[laughter]

00:25:50.530 --> 00:25:55.170
and she came back from France with this mission.
And nothing would, nothing would stop her.

00:25:55.170 --> 00:26:01.950
You know the book was turned down by the publisher
in Boston that had taken an option on it and

00:26:01.950 --> 00:26:08.250
instead of just boo-hooing about it and saying,
"Well, well I'm no good.", it would just -- fired

00:26:08.250 --> 00:26:13.870
her determination to get this message across
and not to compromise it.

00:26:13.870 --> 00:26:24.030
And little things like, I remember I asked
her once, we were doing a [casavie] for the

00:26:24.030 --> 00:26:29.560
second volume of Mastering and I said, "I
can't find a, a real garlic sausage." You

00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:38.280
know it, it was pretty much the American bland
kind of sausage and, that you could get. And

00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:43.320
I said, "Could you give a little formula for
it and people will make their own. Why not?"

00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:45.290
"Good idea," said Julia.

00:26:45.290 --> 00:26:51.060
Well I went up to Cambridge and walked into
her kitchen, she, and she had posted on a

00:26:51.060 --> 00:26:59.470
whole wall her findings going back to old
charcuterie manuals and trying the different

00:26:59.470 --> 00:27:05.930
proportions, and finally at the end was her
version and she said, "This is it" or something

00:27:05.930 --> 00:27:14.620
like that. I say, "Julia" and she said, "It
wasn't hard. It's just like making a hamburger."

00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:15.620
[laughs]

00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:16.620
[laughter]

00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:27.520
But that, that, that absolute dedication and
she was not, she wasn't so adverse to change,

00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:34.260
but she was very particular about whether
the Cuisinart would really do this or this

00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:40.800
and you mustn't put potatoes in it because
they turn to glue. But you can make beautiful,

00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:46.950
beautiful things of purees and - I, I always
used to come home and buy a new piece of equipment

00:27:46.950 --> 00:27:49.210
after I'd been up visiting Julia -

00:27:49.210 --> 00:27:50.210
[laughter]

00:27:50.210 --> 00:27:59.870
So she had that [ ] when she said to me that,
"Judith you and I were born at the right time."

00:27:59.870 --> 00:28:08.800
Yes, but she acted on it and so it was a very
much a force of personality.

00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:17.300
&gt;&gt;Q: So what was your reaction when you heard
that Julie Powell was, [clearing throat] excuse

00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:21.940
me, cooking through 'Mastering the Art of
French Cooking' strictly in order; all within

00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:23.680
a year. Did that seem adventurous? Did is
seem a little daft? Were you perhaps inspired

00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:30.000
to try it yourself with some other book, anything
like that?

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:35.810
&gt;&gt;Judith Jones: Well my reaction was first
I wanted to, somebody told me about it and

00:28:35.810 --> 00:28:43.390
I wanted to see what she was doing. If you've
seen the movie, it's, it's a movie version.

00:28:43.390 --> 00:28:44.750
[laughter]

00:28:44.750 --> 00:28:49.420
But I was going to go out and see her and
also talk about rights and using Julia's recipes

00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:57.400
and just things like that. I mean sort of
a business trip. And Julia was on the West

00:28:57.400 --> 00:29:08.261
Coast and she said, "Well, we'd better look
at the blog." So we looked at the blog and

00:29:08.261 --> 00:29:12.340
we both decided that it wasn't anything Julia
should have anything to do with principally

00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:16.761
because I think Julia felt, "You can't be
serious talking about food when you have a

00:29:16.761 --> 00:29:22.600
vocabulary of four letter words to describe
things." And that was about what it was.

00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:30.580
So she, we just thought let her have her blog;
let's stay away from it. So that was that

00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:32.851
I called up and cancelled the dinner party
and -

00:29:32.851 --> 00:29:33.851
[laughter]

00:29:33.851 --> 00:29:43.720
or didn't come to the dinner party. But I,
I think it's, it's understandable. A lot of

00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:49.790
people come away from that and think, "Why
was Julia so mean to Julie?" Julia was not

00:29:49.790 --> 00:29:55.290
mean to, she was a most supportive and generous
person, but you had to be a serious cook.

00:29:55.290 --> 00:30:02.610
She talked, she had a word for those who weren't
and she called them the "flimsies."

00:30:02.610 --> 00:30:03.610
[laughter]

00:30:03.610 --> 00:30:10.230
Well I think she just didn't take Julie seriously.
Does that answer pretty much the question?

00:30:10.230 --> 00:30:11.230
Yeah.

00:30:11.230 --> 00:30:17.280
I have to be careful saying this and I'm not,
I'm not trying to demean Julie; she had her

00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:24.930
own agenda. But they were kind of worlds apart.

00:30:24.930 --> 00:30:26.260
[pause]

00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:33.960
Also I think that I give credit to Nora Ephron
because I think she had a wonderful concept

00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:37.721
in putting this movie together to have the
different generations of the Julia's and the

00:30:37.721 --> 00:30:44.920
different attitudes and I think Julia does
come out as the one you wanna root for. [laughs]

00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:45.920
[laughter]

00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:46.920
[pause]

00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:51.670
&gt;&gt;Commentator: Well Judith, thank you so much.

00:30:51.670 --> 00:30:56.920
&gt;&gt;Judith Jones: Thank you all for coming.

00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:57.920
[applause]

00:30:57.920 --> 00:31:03.670
Fortunately you didn't have to get through
this -
