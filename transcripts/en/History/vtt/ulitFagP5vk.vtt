00:00:02.627 --> 00:00:04.504
- Hi, I'm Chuck Cook
in Dundee, Oregon.

00:00:04.504 --> 00:00:06.339
And welcome to my little shop.

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:08.675
I have my pile of brick
forge, here.

00:00:08.675 --> 00:00:11.845
I bought two burners,
but everything else

00:00:11.845 --> 00:00:14.639
was recycled firebrick..

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.015
It's on a rolling cart,

00:00:16.015 --> 00:00:18.184
but the rolling cart's
actually dying.

00:00:18.184 --> 00:00:20.895
It's propped up, so it
can't move at the moment.

00:00:20.895 --> 00:00:23.940
Drill press, welding station,

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:27.193
I have a really old MIG--
a stick welder

00:00:27.193 --> 00:00:30.113
which is the welder I use most
down there.

00:00:30.113 --> 00:00:31.614
I am not a great welder.

00:00:31.614 --> 00:00:33.283
You know, welding was one of
the problems I had

00:00:33.283 --> 00:00:34.993
during the challenges,

00:00:34.993 --> 00:00:37.454
<i>simply because I'd never
used a MIG</i>

00:00:37.454 --> 00:00:38.872
quite that advanced.

00:00:38.872 --> 00:00:40.874
Mine's pretty old school.

00:00:40.874 --> 00:00:44.419
<i>♪ ♪</i>

00:00:44.419 --> 00:00:46.379
- So, yeah,
this is my forge area

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.922
and this whole area

00:00:47.922 --> 00:00:50.216
used to just be
my whole shop.

00:00:50.216 --> 00:00:52.886
But over time as I started
getting new tools,

00:00:52.886 --> 00:00:56.347
I moved all my other machines
and stuff to a different area.

00:00:56.347 --> 00:00:58.349
Still have my original forge

00:00:58.349 --> 00:00:59.768
that I first started with.

00:00:59.768 --> 00:01:01.352
I don't use this anvil anymore,

00:01:01.352 --> 00:01:02.729
but this was my first one,

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:04.647
and it was made
out of railroad track.

00:01:04.647 --> 00:01:06.483
It wasn't the best at all,
but this is really where

00:01:06.483 --> 00:01:08.067
my passion for bladesmithing
came from,

00:01:08.067 --> 00:01:09.986
was when I first
worked on this one.

00:01:09.986 --> 00:01:11.738
I'm really more of
an organized person,

00:01:11.738 --> 00:01:14.240
so I like to have everything,
you know,

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.242
up on the wall
if I'm not using it.

00:01:16.242 --> 00:01:17.410
This is my power hammer.

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.162
And I absolutely
love this thing

00:01:19.162 --> 00:01:22.749
because I can work on
several pieces of metal at once

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:25.251
since you're not tiring
yourself out forging by hand.

00:01:25.251 --> 00:01:27.420
- My electric heat treat oven.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.880
I did electric with this

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.423
because it's digitally
controlled,

00:01:30.423 --> 00:01:32.425
so I can set the temperature.

00:01:32.425 --> 00:01:36.137
The challenges really comes
into being able

00:01:36.137 --> 00:01:39.808
to fit as much equipment in
in such a small space.

00:01:39.808 --> 00:01:42.727
I have dreams of having
a power hammer like Big BLU,

00:01:42.727 --> 00:01:45.814
but at the moment, I don't know
where I'd even fit

00:01:45.814 --> 00:01:48.817
that thing in here
if I get one.

00:01:48.817 --> 00:01:51.611
<i>- So this is the other
portion of my shop.</i>

00:01:51.611 --> 00:01:52.987
Kinda took over this area.

00:01:52.987 --> 00:01:54.447
Being that I make
kitchen knives,

00:01:54.447 --> 00:01:56.199
this is all my different
handle materials

00:01:56.199 --> 00:01:57.283
I usually use for those.

00:01:57.283 --> 00:01:58.701
They're a much higher price.

00:01:58.701 --> 00:02:00.370
Usually a little more brittle,
though, so--

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:02.330
This is mostly more of,
like, the design table

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.332
and where I keep all of
my knives that are

00:02:04.332 --> 00:02:06.543
currently in production,
so you see these

00:02:06.543 --> 00:02:08.169
were just freshly forged.

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:10.129
And I had to
stop working on them

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:13.007
because I had to start
training for this competition.

00:02:13.007 --> 00:02:15.635
That's my shop.
It's not as big as the studio,

00:02:15.635 --> 00:02:19.389
but I'm comfortable here
and I know my tools well.

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:21.015
And I've got
a lot of work to do,

00:02:21.015 --> 00:02:23.685
but we're gonna get it done.
