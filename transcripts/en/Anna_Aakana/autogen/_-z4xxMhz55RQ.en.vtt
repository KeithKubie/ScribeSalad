00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.060
So a few years ago, I had cosmetic surgery.

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.480
And I won't say what it was exactly for privacy reasons,

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.960
But I will say that it was the breast decision for me.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.900
So I've had A-cup...le of changes that I've wanted to make for about a decade,

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.680
'cuz I was so tired of looking in the mirror and seeing Mowgli from The Jungle Book

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.000
when in my head, I was obviously an Amazonian warrior woman.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.520
And as I was grappling with whether or not to commit to this operation,

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.480
I had this titillating discussion with my friend who asked me:

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.840
"Well, aren't you worried about what other people are gonna think?"

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.960
"Like, I know that this is coming from a healthy place, but what about the stigma?"

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.780
And I realized: as a woman, you can't win.

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.720
You know, when it comes to the constructs of beauty, it's full of booby traps.

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:50.240
You have to jug-gle the unrealistic and often contradictory expectations of society

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.940
where you're supposed to be beautiful but not know you're beautiful, otherwise you're conceited.

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.440
And you have to try to be beautiful, but don't try too hard because then you're desperate.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.200
But if you don't try hard enough, you're just lazy and probably gonna die alone.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.120
So when I've racked up all of these hypocrisies,

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.720
I came to the conclusion that I just have to do what feels right for me.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.320
No matter what, we're going to be criticized.

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.700
And I truly believe that our bodies are just a vessel, just a spiritual lesson,

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.700
And one that will wrinkle and decay,

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.700
So while I'm here, I want mine to reflect on the outside how I see myself on the inside.

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.340
And I know I'm milking these puns, but I can honestly say to anyone who wants to pass

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.840
judgment on the personal decisions I make regarding my self-image:

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.020
You can calm your tits.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.560
I'm Anna Akana.

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.540
And if for some reason you haven't figured out what I'm talking about by now

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:39.860
then tough titty, baby

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:41.320
