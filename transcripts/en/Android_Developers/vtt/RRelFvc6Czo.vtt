JEFF SMITH: Music, ultimately,
is a global medium.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.140
And we want to connect
the world through

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:15.288
this expressive medium.

00:00:15.288 --> 00:00:16.992
We don't think there's anybody
out there that

00:00:16.992 --> 00:00:18.242
doesn't like music.

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:32.580
PRERNA GUPTA:
[SINGING "AMAZING GRACE"]

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:34.380
JEFF SMITH: Smule's the leader
in mobile, social music.

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.460
We'd like a billion people to
figure out how to make music

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.710
together using mobile devices.

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.210
That's one of the reasons why
we're extremely excited about

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.420
the Android platform.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.730
PRERNA GUPTA: We were amazed at
how many more users we were

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.890
able to reach in such a
short period of time.

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.310
JEFF SMITH: We're now north of
12 million monthly users

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:53.910
hitting our products, and that
compares with about 2 and 1/2

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.520
million a year ago, before
we were on Android and

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.910
GooglePlay.

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:57.770
PRERNA GUPTA: It's
record growth.

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:59.830
It's the fastest growth
we've ever seen.

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:02.450
JODI ROPERT: And we have over
10 million installs now.

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.040
And that's been only
about three months.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.220
80% of our users for Songify
are outside of the US.

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:14.120
Markets like Russia and Brazil
and India and Malaysia.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.090
AutoRap was the first app that
we launched simultaneously

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.640
across platforms, and we were
amazed with what we saw.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.800
Not only did it allow us to
reach more people, there was

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.610
this incredible word
of mouth growth.

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.120
There was this halo effect.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.430
We spent a lot of time trying
to create landing pages and

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.560
images and marketing materials
that allow customers to

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.070
quickly understand what our apps
deliver and get excited

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.680
about it and then install
the application.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.280
When customers install our apps
from a YouTube video,

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.550
they tend to be two to three
times more valuable.

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.410
They are more engaged, they
stay for longer, and they

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:51.650
monetize better.

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.310
PRERNA GUPTA: I think AutoRap
has been a great example of

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.750
how the ability to update
immediately has really helped

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.880
us with our product quality.

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.930
Our rating for AutoRap has been
consistently higher every

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.410
single day, basically, since
we've launched on GooglePlay.

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:08.580
And that's directly a result
of the fact that we can

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:09.930
respond immediately.

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:13.870
When a bug comes up, and when
we're getting certain feedback

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:19.170
from users, we can fix that
in a day and launch it.

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.640
JEFF SMITH: We want to bring
music back to its roots of a

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.630
social, interactive,
expressive medium.

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.580
And that can only happen if we
bring everybody with us.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.830
And that's one of the reasons
why we're so excited about

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.570
Android and GooglePlay.

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.380
We think we open up this
experience to the globe

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:35.630
through this platform.
