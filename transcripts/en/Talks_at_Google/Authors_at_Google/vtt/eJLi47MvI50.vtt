[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.330
SPEAKER: I am very pleased
to introduce and host

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.330
one of my oldest and closest
friends, Mike Hoefflinger.

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.690
Mike and I met at Intel
in the summer of 1997.

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:18.590
He was working on
Intel marketing.

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:20.550
I was right out of
business school.

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.560
And since then, he's
had a fabulous career,

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.990
both at Intel and at Facebook.

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.880
He left Intel
after having served

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.180
as Andy Groves' Chief of Staff
for, I believe, three years--

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:31.886
MIKE HOEFFLINGER: Couple years.

00:00:31.886 --> 00:00:33.510
SPEAKER: --which,
within Intel culture,

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.470
is essentially a clear signal of
succession, in terms of people

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.470
they are grooming to
eventually run the company.

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.880
And if you look at historically
who have been Intel CEOs,

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.880
several have been Andy's chief
of staff, as it turns out.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.440
And then he left.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.920
He left for Facebook and
has gone on to work there.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.004
He worked out for six years?

00:00:52.004 --> 00:00:53.670
MIKE HOEFFLINGER:
Yeah, 6 and 1/2 years.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.920
SPEAKER: And then left, I think,
last year and has since written

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.164
the book "Becoming Facebook."

00:00:57.164 --> 00:00:58.830
And that would be a
great way to get him

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:00.900
in front of friends and
colleagues at Google,

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.060
have him share some
of his thoughts

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:07.485
on working at Intel, Andy
Grove, working for Zuckerberg,

00:01:07.485 --> 00:01:08.690
and working at Facebook.

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:09.670
So Mike, great to have you here.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:10.100
Thanks for coming.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.740
MIKE HOEFFLINGER: Thanks
so much for having me.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.030
I really appreciate it.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.331
Thank you very much.

00:01:14.331 --> 00:01:16.830
SPEAKER: I know that 2 o'clock
on the Friday before Memorial

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:17.830
Day is a tight schedule.

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.320
So thanks, everyone,
for making the time.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.460
So in terms of-- if we
go back to the beginning,

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.180
with Intel in
particular, Andy Groves

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.350
passed away last March--
kind of one of, in my mind,

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.880
one of the defining figures
of global leadership

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.830
and management and obviously
technology as well.

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.160
Do you think there
are any lessons

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.610
that this group and the people
on the video should know,

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.700
as it relates to
what Andy's mantra is

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.770
or principle that everyone
should really kind

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.186
of subscribe to,
or at least think

00:01:48.186 --> 00:01:50.752
about when they're looking
for visions or principles?

00:01:50.752 --> 00:01:51.960
MIKE HOEFFLINGER: Definitely.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.060
And I think one of the
aspects of the book

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.210
is that we think about
these titans, like Andy.

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.140
And literally, they
have single names--

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.623
Andy and Steve and
Mark and Larry and Eli.

00:02:05.623 --> 00:02:08.039
We call them just by one name,
because we know exactly who

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:08.789
we're talking about.

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.150
And they're titans of industry.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:12.690
And I think we celebrate
them to various degrees,

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.611
mythologize them.

00:02:13.611 --> 00:02:15.610
And then we go back to
our jobs, and we're like,

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.560
well, we can never be like those
people, they're super special,

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.490
and I can't be like that.

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.914
And I think that's
actually not so true.

00:02:22.914 --> 00:02:24.580
If you think back to
Grove, for example,

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.550
who clearly put the Silicon
in Silicon Valley-- and I

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.550
don't say that just because
I've worked for him.

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.540
And obviously that was
a huge loss last year.

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.200
But he was maybe the
original, what I call,

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.022
clever foolish CEO,
which is someone

00:02:37.022 --> 00:02:38.730
who has an idea that's
very, very clever,

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.730
but everybody, at the time,
thinks it's totally foolish.

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.400
Andy said in the very early
'90s that not only are

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.970
we going to go build
microprocessors,

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:47.970
but we're going to actually
market them and make

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.230
people care about that.

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.140
And that was completely
insane at the time.

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.670
And now not only
did that happen,

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.590
but we're on to the
next thing already.

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.977
And Steve said, we're going
to go make home computers,

00:02:57.977 --> 00:03:00.060
when nobody thought that
that was at all possible.

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.040
And Larry said that we're going
to organize the information

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.998
when everybody thought
that Yahoo was basically

00:03:03.998 --> 00:03:05.370
done with that whole topic.

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.100
Yahoo was pulling
engineers off of search

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.900
by the hundreds when
Larry and Sergey said,

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.900
no, no, hang on a second,
we can do that better.

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.787
And it's still, to me, amazing
that John Doerr put $20 million

00:03:15.787 --> 00:03:16.620
into that back then.

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.250
We can talk about the
ping-pong table in Larry

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.021
and Sergey's
boardroom in a minute.

00:03:23.021 --> 00:03:25.270
And so what can we learn
from them is that, of course,

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.920
you have to have vision.

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.120
You have to be able to
see around the corner.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.380
You have to be able
to see something

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.755
that not everybody else is
seeing, because an idea that's

00:03:30.755 --> 00:03:32.580
clever that everybody
thinks is clever

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.020
is just a big-ass food fight.

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.660
So there is no winning
there, at least not

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.510
in a highly leveraged way.

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.420
But to me, what
is also important

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.280
about these folks is
that they do get credit

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.196
for being a visionary.

00:03:45.196 --> 00:03:48.600
What they don't get credit for
is that on a day-to-day basis,

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.690
they have the will to
move towards that goal.

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.299
Everybody thinks Andy is a
genius because he moved Intel

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:56.340
from memories into
microprocessors and then said,

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.756
we can make people care about
this, Intel Inside program--

00:03:58.756 --> 00:03:59.550
blah, blah, blah.

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.966
But he was really a genius
because he got up every morning

00:04:01.966 --> 00:04:03.120
and said, are we done yet?

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.840
Are we done yet?

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:04.690
How is that going?

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:06.000
Are we done yet?

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.110
And I have to imagine--

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.026
I don't know for sure,
but I have to imagine--

00:04:09.026 --> 00:04:11.070
Sundar, Larry, Sergey,
your leaders here--

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:12.460
that you feel that way--

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:15.420
that you don't just dream
things but that you go

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:16.740
do them every day.

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:19.290
And I think we can
totally learn from that.

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:21.829
You might not be able to be
Grove or Jobs or Zuckerberg

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:25.170
or Larry or Sundar,
but you can 100%

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:26.820
think about looking
around the corner

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.477
and 100% think about
getting to the doing.

00:04:30.477 --> 00:04:31.060
SPEAKER: Cool.

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:35.890
And so when I left Intel in
'99, you were, at the time,

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:37.070
Andy's Chief of Staff.

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:39.700
And I think Andy had
began, at your urging,

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.250
to kind of do a
round-robin meeting

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:47.260
with prominent start-ups, and
some small, some not so small.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.890
And one of them happened to
be Larry and Sergey at Google

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:53.620
when there was maybe
15, 20, 30 people, which

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.200
I think Susan kind of
brokered back in the day.

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:00.370
So can you talk about that kind
of meeting-- how it came to be,

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.310
what was the take-away when
you got Larry and Sergey

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:05.650
in their earliest days
in a room with Andy

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:07.836
Grove in the fall of 1999?

00:05:07.836 --> 00:05:09.710
MIKE HOEFFLINGER: Yeah,
that's special stuff.

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:12.043
We were just joking about if
there's interns in the room

00:05:12.043 --> 00:05:14.910
and you're 19, 20
years old today,

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:16.900
you were born after
this moment that we're

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.990
describing, roughly-ish.

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:23.580
But what Grove was really
good at is he, at that point--

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:25.180
we're talking '99.

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.120
He had already basically
been mythologized

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.820
as maybe one of the most
important leaders in Silicon

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:29.320
Valley.

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.060
He could have
easily assumed that,

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:32.524
whatever I think is right.

00:05:32.524 --> 00:05:33.940
But he would spend
a ton of time--

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:36.190
especially this was
dot and dot com.

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:38.244
So Intel really, really
had to figure out

00:05:38.244 --> 00:05:39.910
how to get this
internet thing together.

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:41.410
And he was trying
to figure out, who

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:43.974
are these leaders in the
internet space that are legit,

00:05:43.974 --> 00:05:46.390
and who are the leaders in the
internet space that are not

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:47.140
so legit?

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:49.600
So we probably visited
50 leaders in the space.

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:53.320
And John Doerr, who's a famous
venture capitalist at Kleiner

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:57.269
Perkins, was, before he
went to Kleiner Perkins,

00:05:57.269 --> 00:05:58.810
a relatively big
figure at Intel that

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:01.090
had had a relationship with
Andy Grove at the time.

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:03.250
And of course, it was
John, as we just said,

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:06.400
who put $20 million into Google.

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:07.540
And John had--

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:08.540
I remember this exactly.

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:10.456
This is going to sound
like I'm name-dropping.

00:06:10.456 --> 00:06:12.700
But it's an awesome story,
so I'll do it anyway.

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:14.950
So we were on a plane with John.

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:16.870
It was maybe John's plane.

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:19.092
And Andy and I were
going up to Seattle

00:06:19.092 --> 00:06:20.800
to visit Jeff Bezos,
which has got to be,

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.640
like, the single best
namedropping sentence ever.

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:27.890
And while we were flying up
there, John looks at Andy.

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:30.460
He's like, yeah, you should
talk to these two guys,

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:32.680
I just put $20
million into them.

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:33.310
It's '99.

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:33.940
It's Google.

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:35.500
I'm not 100% sure--

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:37.500
I might have shown Andy Google--

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:38.530
the "I'm lucky" button.

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:40.780
SPEAKER: It was the Pentium
II search I think you did.

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:41.738
MIKE HOEFFLINGER: Yeah.

00:06:41.738 --> 00:06:47.170
And I want to say, maybe you're
the one that told me about it.

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:48.430
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:49.390
SPEAKER: I'm going to
interrupt this story

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:51.681
to tell you how we got to
Google, because what happened

00:06:51.681 --> 00:06:54.790
was Susan and I were working
at Intel at the time.

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:56.754
And Susan said,
I'm leaving to work

00:06:56.754 --> 00:06:59.170
with these guys in my garage,
it's going to be a cool gig,

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:01.000
knock yourself out, I'm
going someplace else,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.333
I don't want to join those guys.

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:09.171
So I went to go say hello to
Mike in his cube, which was

00:07:09.171 --> 00:07:10.420
fifth floor, important people.

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:11.410
Andy's sitting across the way.

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:12.940
And I said, hey,
let's go to Yahoo

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:14.310
and do a search for Pentium II.

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:17.050
And I did a search
Pentium II in Yahoo.

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:18.280
It was all garbage--

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:19.090
just garbage.

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:20.819
For top 10 results,
all garbage results.

00:07:20.819 --> 00:07:22.360
And they said, let's
go to Google.com

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:25.482
and do a search for Pentium II.

00:07:25.482 --> 00:07:26.940
I did a search for
Pentium II right

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:28.990
on the Intel.com
Pentium II website.

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:31.900
And that's when the light
bulb went off, definitely

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:33.600
in my head.

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:36.152
It cost me a lot of money,
because I didn't go into Google

00:07:36.152 --> 00:07:37.360
after having done that query.

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:38.110
MIKE HOEFFLINGER: And
I think we should spend

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:39.060
a lot of time dwelling on that.

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:40.101
SPEAKER: Yeah, of course.

00:07:40.101 --> 00:07:45.100
And then Mike kind of saw,
hey, that's kind of cool.

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:46.990
The other prominent
website in the industry

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:48.670
can't even get to
our flagship website.

00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:50.170
When you search for
the product, you

00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:53.200
go to some
20-something-person company

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:55.516
right on the actual
page you want to go to.

00:07:55.516 --> 00:07:56.890
And that's, I
think, kind of what

00:07:56.890 --> 00:07:59.820
prompted the intro to--
that's when John mentioned it.

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:00.570
You recognized it.

00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:01.150
MIKE HOEFFLINGER: Exactly right.

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:02.780
And those two things
came together.

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:04.990
And that's exactly what it was.

00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:08.770
And the other thing that had
really piqued Grove's interest

00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:12.520
at the time is-- because I think
the word was out that Larry

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:15.610
and Sergey were
building on x86--

00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:18.400
Intel architecture,
standard microprocessors,

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:21.110
in standard servers,
which now, of course,

00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:22.840
we recognize as the
fundamental move that

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:24.610
actually made Cloud possible.

00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:26.440
But back then, you
got to remember,

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:29.500
dot and dot com was the
law of the land, basically.

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:32.169
If you were not getting
custom-designed servers,

00:08:32.169 --> 00:08:33.429
what the hell were you doing?

00:08:33.429 --> 00:08:35.591
Whereas Larry and Sergey,
going back to Stanford

00:08:35.591 --> 00:08:38.049
when they were operating under
the desk-- they were putting

00:08:38.049 --> 00:08:39.174
their own servers together.

00:08:39.174 --> 00:08:41.380
You guys have heard
this story 100 times.

00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:44.150
I still remember Larry calling
me up in the years afterwards

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:45.939
and being like, we
cannot get enough CPUs,

00:08:45.939 --> 00:08:47.980
can you have your channel
partners get their shit

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:50.920
together, because we're having a
server build party this weekend

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:52.720
and I need 1,000 more.

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:56.395
Like, Larry himself--
and so Andy's like, hmm,

00:08:56.395 --> 00:08:57.880
that's fascinating,
because we're

00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:01.000
trying to figure out what the
future of Intel microprocessors

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.625
was beyond the desktop.

00:09:02.625 --> 00:09:04.750
And so I'm like, OK, this
sounds like a great idea.

00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:07.750
So we go together with
John and Andy and myself.

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:09.700
And we visit Larry and Sergey.

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:13.660
And they're on the second
floor, above the ice cream

00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:15.310
shop, downtown Palo Alto.

00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:17.500
Neither of those
things exist anymore.

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:21.250
But it was, I want to say,
20, maximum 30 people.

00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:24.010
I think Marissa was
the only woman there.

00:09:24.010 --> 00:09:26.210
And we were in what
Larry and Sergey

00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:28.710
called their boardroom, which
I think was more a lunch room.

00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:30.450
And we were literally,
I shit you not,

00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:33.002
having the meeting
at a ping-pong table.

00:09:33.002 --> 00:09:34.710
And they were talking
about what the game

00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:37.090
plan was for this thing.

00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:40.360
SPEAKER: For ping-pong
or the company?

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:43.830
MIKE HOEFFLINGER: It's
intertwined, obviously.

00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:46.920
And I remember thinking
very distinctly--

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:49.380
because Andy and I, after we
would go to these meetings--

00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:51.300
and we would visit other
leaders, like Jeff Bezos.

00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:52.799
It was fairly clear
to us that these

00:09:52.799 --> 00:09:55.480
are super legitimate
leaders of the future.

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:58.020
This was a totally real thing.

00:09:58.020 --> 00:09:59.640
And then we would
visit other leaders,

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:02.047
names not to be shared,
where we're like,

00:10:02.047 --> 00:10:04.380
oh, I don't know, man, if
that's going to come together.

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:05.760
But I remember the
two of us absolutely

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:07.050
walking away from that
and feeling like it

00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:08.240
was a very, very big deal.

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:10.177
And Andy wanted
to make very sure

00:10:10.177 --> 00:10:12.510
that Google and Larry and
Sergey were getting everything

00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:18.450
that they needed to build a
massively parallel x86 base

00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:20.580
universe that served
you good search results.

00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:24.150
SPEAKER: So was it a combination
of roadmap or charisma

00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:24.690
or just--

00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:26.370
what was it about
the meeting or them

00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:29.742
that made you and Andy realize
that even as a 20-person shop,

00:10:29.742 --> 00:10:30.700
there's something here?

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:30.780
MIKE HOEFFLINGER: Yeah.

00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:33.960
I think, well, the results spoke
for themselves, like you said.

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:37.034
One of the beauties, of course,
of great internet products

00:10:37.034 --> 00:10:38.700
like Google and
Facebook is that there's

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:40.050
zero barrier to trying it.

00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:42.180
And if you can have a
great magic moment, which

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:43.860
is fantastic search
results or seeing

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:46.080
your friends in your
news feed, then you

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:47.692
can win, even if you're tiny.

00:10:47.692 --> 00:10:49.150
But I think it was
a couple things.

00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:52.847
One is Larry and Sergey
believed what we believed,

00:10:52.847 --> 00:10:54.930
which is that a standardized
architecture is going

00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:57.240
to be way better for scaling
this thing and making it work,

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:58.360
from a cost perspective.

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:00.252
So we felt
strategically aligned.

00:11:00.252 --> 00:11:01.710
And I remember the
two of them were

00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:03.871
very unaffected, super young.

00:11:03.871 --> 00:11:06.120
I'm going to totally make
up-- they were less than 25,

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:08.260
for sure.

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:11.629
But they were totally
unaffected by talking with Andy.

00:11:11.629 --> 00:11:13.170
And they were very
balanced with him.

00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:14.940
They didn't take
him for granted.

00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:18.050
But they also weren't
stunned at his--

00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:20.860
he's like the authority in
Silicon Valley at the time.

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:23.070
So it just felt
extremely authentic.

00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:24.410
And they were like, this is
what we're going to go build,

00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:25.660
we're very confident about it.

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:27.227
And we're like, I get it.

00:11:27.227 --> 00:11:27.810
SPEAKER: Cool.

00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:31.740
So when you look at having had
a lot of experience with Andy

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:34.830
and also a lot of experience
with Mark at Facebook,

00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:36.850
what linearities exist
between their styles,

00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:38.340
their perspective, how
they approach the business,

00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:39.798
how they want to
grow the business,

00:11:39.798 --> 00:11:41.312
how they disrupt the business?

00:11:41.312 --> 00:11:43.020
MIKE HOEFFLINGER: I
had a chance in 2009,

00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:44.710
when I started
working at Facebook,

00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:47.340
to tell Andy that
I was there now,

00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:49.500
to tell Mark that I
had worked for Andy,

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:51.150
and whether the two of them
would be interested in meeting.

00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:51.941
And they said, yes.

00:11:51.941 --> 00:11:54.480
And I had a chance to sit in
on that lunch, which you have

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:55.729
to kind of paint this picture.

00:11:55.729 --> 00:11:57.150
Andy is in his 70s.

00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:58.500
Andy is in his early 20s.

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:00.150
They're separated by 50 years--

00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:03.420
two generations-- not just two
generations in age, but also

00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:04.960
two generations in technology.

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:07.260
Andy was CPU, and then
came the internet,

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.860
and then came, if you
will, Mark and mobile.

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:12.270
I'm not equating those
two, necessarily.

00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:15.060
And yet, one thing that's
amazing about Mark--

00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:17.990
and I bet you feel this
from Larry, Sergey, Sundar,

00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:19.710
and much of people
here as well--

00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:21.960
is, as much as you have
a vision for how things

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:24.840
need to move forward,
there is a respect

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:26.560
for the past in Silicon Valley.

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:28.830
There's an interest to
learn from the past.

00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:31.300
So Zuck was
absolutely a disciple

00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:34.230
of Grove's kind of management
Bible "Only the Paranoid

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:35.317
Survive."

00:12:35.317 --> 00:12:37.650
And so they were trying to
dial each other a little bit.

00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:40.030
Andy was trying to figure out
if Zuck was the real deal.

00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:41.850
And Zuck was trying to
kind of deal with the fact

00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:43.770
that Andy had jumped off
the page of this book,

00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:45.170
and he had a chance
to chat with him now.

00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:47.461
And they were kind of circling
each other a little bit.

00:12:47.461 --> 00:12:49.260
And then Grove
went for the gusto

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:54.100
and said, why did you pass up
the billion dollars from Yahoo?

00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:58.260
And Zuck was able to read that
not as an offensive question

00:12:58.260 --> 00:12:59.520
but as a real question.

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:00.660
And he kind of thought
about it a little bit.

00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:02.250
And he said, look, I just
felt really confident

00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:04.020
that we could be
much, much bigger

00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:06.660
than what Yahoo we
thought we could be.

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:09.540
And Andy really
understood in that moment

00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:10.636
that Mark was like him.

00:13:10.636 --> 00:13:12.510
You remember what I said
about Andy-- right--

00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:15.190
the willpower to get up tomorrow
morning and ask yourself,

00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:17.880
are we done yet, how are
we doing on that thing--

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:19.960
that Mark hadn't just
seen around the corner,

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:22.200
but had the willpower
to go build this thing.

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:26.460
And that, to me, was amazing to
see it across two generations--

00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:29.850
that you had this echo of
this willpower-ey thing

00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:32.040
that I had seen in
Andy that I felt

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:35.160
was so important, actually,
that Mark has that as well.

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:37.540
And it completely
doesn't matter which

00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:41.190
epoch of Silicon
Valley you are or where

00:13:41.190 --> 00:13:43.800
in the pecking order of
Silicon Valley you are.

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:46.350
That's the defining thing
to me of Silicon Valley--

00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:48.760
the doing never gets in
the way of the talking.

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:51.540
And if you ever find yourself at
a room, either at your company

00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:53.640
or at some other company,
where the talking is

00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:57.000
getting in the way of the
doing, run to the hills.

00:13:59.690 --> 00:14:01.739
Code settles arguments.

00:14:01.739 --> 00:14:03.780
I don't want to pretend
that I know your culture.

00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:05.155
But I think this
is what it feels

00:14:05.155 --> 00:14:08.512
like here, because I know
that's what it feels like there.

00:14:08.512 --> 00:14:10.470
SPEAKER: On that topic
of when the talking gets

00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:12.136
in the way of doing,
and I'll say this--

00:14:12.136 --> 00:14:12.999
how do you stop it?

00:14:12.999 --> 00:14:14.790
When you actually
encounter it in a meeting

00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:16.950
and it's not so easy to run
for the hills, so to speak,

00:14:16.950 --> 00:14:17.824
how do you intervene?

00:14:17.824 --> 00:14:21.250
What can you do to kind of get
in the way of that trajectory?

00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:24.090
MIKE HOEFFLINGER: Well, what
I think internet businesses

00:14:24.090 --> 00:14:26.850
like us--

00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:29.940
what's so amazing is that
we really, if we want to,

00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:32.250
we can really pay
very close attention

00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:35.670
to the people that
are using our stuff.

00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:39.090
And that's the one thing
you can never escape.

00:14:39.090 --> 00:14:41.632
People either like your stuff,
or they don't like your stuff.

00:14:41.632 --> 00:14:43.923
And tomorrow, they like your
stuff better than they did

00:14:43.923 --> 00:14:45.150
today, or they don't.

00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:47.454
And you had an idea, and
you put it in front of them.

00:14:47.454 --> 00:14:49.370
And they either sparked
to it, or they didn't.

00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:51.840
Or you're observing
them do stuff that's

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:54.030
using the product in a way
that you hadn't intended,

00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:55.650
and it gives you a
chance to adjust.

00:14:55.650 --> 00:15:00.870
So I think us, as businesses--
imagine you're Ford where

00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:02.670
it's very difficult, because--

00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:04.049
I'm totally making up a name.

00:15:04.049 --> 00:15:05.340
I'm not trying to pick on Ford.

00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:07.050
But they have a
channel structure,

00:15:07.050 --> 00:15:10.770
and Dearborn can be pretty far
removed from a person in Idaho

00:15:10.770 --> 00:15:12.704
who's using their F-150.

00:15:12.704 --> 00:15:14.370
It's a little difficult
to know, do they

00:15:14.370 --> 00:15:16.290
love this version of
the F-150 or don't they?

00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:19.561
Whereas we-- this is not
a religious question.

00:15:19.561 --> 00:15:21.810
Either people like your thing
more today than they did

00:15:21.810 --> 00:15:23.190
yesterday, or they don't.

00:15:23.190 --> 00:15:24.810
And we should keep
building stuff.

00:15:24.810 --> 00:15:26.760
For a second, I'll pick on Wave.

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:29.450
And then I'll go pick
on a Facebook thing.

00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:31.542
SPEAKER: Meaning the early
Google social products?

00:15:31.542 --> 00:15:33.750
MIKE HOEFFLINGER: Yeah,
whatever you want to call it,

00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:36.480
which, by the way,
was it's problem.

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:37.016
I'm sorry.

00:15:37.016 --> 00:15:38.140
And by the way, of course--

00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:40.620
and unfortunately, I
forgot his name now.

00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:43.319
He built Wave here and
then went to work with--

00:15:43.319 --> 00:15:44.360
AUDIENCE: Verizon Center.

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:45.651
MIKE HOEFFLINGER: Yes, exactly.

00:15:45.651 --> 00:15:47.790
He went to work with
Mark on Graph Search.

00:15:47.790 --> 00:15:49.530
Because you have to
a million percent

00:15:49.530 --> 00:15:52.740
applaud him for building
it and, at the same time,

00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:56.430
a million percent applaud you
for shutting it down, exactly

00:15:56.430 --> 00:16:02.010
the same way that Zuckerberg
leaned in like crazy on Google

00:16:02.010 --> 00:16:04.410
Home, which was this
little Android replacement

00:16:04.410 --> 00:16:06.517
doohickey, which is
people are finally like,

00:16:06.517 --> 00:16:07.600
this is too much Facebook.

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:10.500
I like Facebook, but I'd like
it to not take over my phone.

00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:11.730
And so they launched it--

00:16:11.730 --> 00:16:15.300
massive fanfare, CEO
of HTC, CEO of AT&amp;T--

00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:18.859
and then had to shut it down,
because it just wasn't working.

00:16:18.859 --> 00:16:20.400
And that's exactly
what we should do.

00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:24.000
We should a million percent
throw it down the field.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.250
And when it doesn't work,
we should stop and move

00:16:26.250 --> 00:16:28.080
on to the next thing,
because we know.

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:29.410
There is no religious argument.

00:16:29.410 --> 00:16:31.951
People either like your stuff,
or they don't like your stuff.

00:16:31.951 --> 00:16:34.496
We have all the numbers.

00:16:34.496 --> 00:16:35.870
SPEAKER: I'm
wondering if there's

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:38.515
a way-- if you can't invest
everything in throwing down

00:16:38.515 --> 00:16:40.640
the field, how do you
self-select the ones that you

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:42.890
think have the highest
probability of actually meeting

00:16:42.890 --> 00:16:46.247
success in a smaller company
environment where you just

00:16:46.247 --> 00:16:48.580
can't afford to do everything
at once, at the same time?

00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:49.538
MIKE HOEFFLINGER: Yeah.

00:16:49.538 --> 00:16:52.204
And you have to be brutal
about that, for sure.

00:16:52.204 --> 00:16:53.620
And of course,
everybody will say,

00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:56.260
you've got to make a decision
with less than 100% certainty.

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:58.942
So you got to do two things.

00:16:58.942 --> 00:17:00.400
The reason every
one of you is here

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:04.569
is because you have a
point of view about stuff.

00:17:04.569 --> 00:17:06.310
That's why Google hired you.

00:17:06.310 --> 00:17:08.800
And so you've got to lean
into your point of view.

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:09.609
I believe x.

00:17:09.609 --> 00:17:11.839
I believe the next thing
that we could do is x.

00:17:11.839 --> 00:17:13.089
And you got to lean into that.

00:17:13.089 --> 00:17:14.420
The people around you
have to lean into that.

00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:15.670
You have to speak up.

00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:17.470
Your leaders have to listen.

00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:20.420
So you have to have a point of
view about what might be next,

00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:21.670
because there's no guarantees.

00:17:21.670 --> 00:17:24.564
If there was some guarantee,
then a couple of women in

00:17:24.564 --> 00:17:26.230
[INAUDIBLE] would
have built it already.

00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:27.771
I was going to say
a couple of dudes,

00:17:27.771 --> 00:17:31.300
but isn't that the problem
in Silicon Valley today.

00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:33.806
And then I think
you just have to go.

00:17:33.806 --> 00:17:35.180
You have to have
a point of view.

00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:37.150
You have to allow
the data that you've

00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:39.250
experienced in your
life, whether you

00:17:39.250 --> 00:17:41.830
have spent all of your career
here or somewhere else,

00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:43.327
to inform you.

00:17:43.327 --> 00:17:44.660
And then you have to make a bet.

00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:46.270
And how you make
that bet, by the way,

00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:47.586
completely decides your future.

00:17:47.586 --> 00:17:49.335
And I'm taking execution
for granted there

00:17:49.335 --> 00:17:51.010
for a second, which is
like, in good companies,

00:17:51.010 --> 00:17:52.300
you should be able to do that.

00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:56.860
So your ability to come
up with the next idea

00:17:56.860 --> 00:18:00.832
faster than the other
guy and build that thing

00:18:00.832 --> 00:18:02.290
is defining, because
if you can put

00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:05.300
a magic moment in front of
somebody before somebody else,

00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:07.090
you win.

00:18:07.090 --> 00:18:09.340
SPEAKER: So in terms of your
transition out of Intel,

00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:12.190
you were on a great
career path, obviously.

00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:13.300
What pulled you out?

00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:15.914
How was Facebook, as a
smaller company today,

00:18:15.914 --> 00:18:17.830
at the time, able to
essentially extract you--

00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:20.759
who has had a clear path, a
clear future, a clear great

00:18:20.759 --> 00:18:22.300
future at Intel--
out of that company

00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:25.640
into something which was much
more speculative at the time?

00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:27.390
MIKE HOEFFLINGER: Yeah.

00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:28.990
The morning I told
my boss at Intel

00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:32.170
that I was moving to Facebook,
she told me I made VP.

00:18:32.170 --> 00:18:34.510
And this was the fall of 2008.

00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:36.490
The economy is shit--

00:18:36.490 --> 00:18:39.340
like, super not good.

00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:42.950
And I'm leaving Intel, which
is an annuity, basically.

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:46.300
It's funny.

00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:48.341
At the time, I don't
remember feeling that panic.

00:18:48.341 --> 00:18:51.100
I should have clearly
been panicked.

00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:53.680
Phenomenal company-- super
phenomenal company, Intel,

00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:54.820
just to be very clear.

00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:56.685
But I was running the
Intel Inside program

00:18:56.685 --> 00:18:58.810
at the time, which, together
with the [INAUDIBLE],,

00:18:58.810 --> 00:19:02.440
spent $2 billion a year
marketing personal computers.

00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:07.967
And the digital advertising
offerings were huge for us.

00:19:07.967 --> 00:19:09.550
We had a big
relationship with Google.

00:19:09.550 --> 00:19:11.320
We had a burgeoning
relationship with Facebook.

00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:12.880
We were beginning to see
that there was something

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:15.430
interesting happening there,
in terms the understanding

00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:18.340
that they had of people and the
ability to create demand there

00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:20.710
and pairing that with what
we were doing obviously

00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:24.052
with search, which
was to convert intent.

00:19:24.052 --> 00:19:25.510
And at the time,
I had this feeling

00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:27.400
that it would be good
to be at a place that

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:28.510
might be good at mobile.

00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:31.150
So this was super
roughly 2008. iPhone

00:19:31.150 --> 00:19:33.860
had made clear that smartphones
were not going to be a niche.

00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:37.030
And basically, my
whole philosophy was,

00:19:37.030 --> 00:19:38.640
if I'm going to not
be an Intel lifer,

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:40.340
I have one time
to make a change,

00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:41.700
and this might be a good one.

00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:43.150
SPEAKER: And so what were
the criteria for you to say,

00:19:43.150 --> 00:19:44.120
this is the one that would--

00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:44.740
this is the one you would--

00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:46.150
MIKE HOEFFLINGER: I liked
Facebook as a product,

00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:46.540
personally.

00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:47.414
I used it personally.

00:19:47.414 --> 00:19:50.890
I felt that they were in a good
position to do well in mobile.

00:19:50.890 --> 00:19:54.720
I didn't know how
right I was about that.

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:58.139
And it was clear
to me, as a person

00:19:58.139 --> 00:19:59.680
who spent an enormous
amount of money

00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:02.055
in advertising, that this was
going to be a good product.

00:20:02.055 --> 00:20:04.040
SPEAKER: OK.

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:06.250
So if we get to the
book, why write the book?

00:20:06.250 --> 00:20:09.662
And who's going to
play you in the movie?

00:20:09.662 --> 00:20:11.620
MIKE HOEFFLINGER: A super,
super old Tom Cruise

00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:15.310
will play me in the movie.

00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:17.950
And if I'm honest with myself,
an old and overweight Tom

00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:20.080
Cruise, which he'll never be.

00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:22.630
I don't know how he does that.

00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:26.230
So we just simply
hadn't written down,

00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:28.990
I think, anything about
Facebook since the movie.

00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:33.790
And to me, the seven
years since 2009,

00:20:33.790 --> 00:20:37.180
2010 are way, way,
way more interesting--

00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:39.820
a 10x in the user
base, 100 in revenue,

00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:41.380
four of the top
six communications

00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:42.790
products in the world.

00:20:42.790 --> 00:20:44.740
I don't care which
side of the truth

00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:47.020
you come out on how the
hell Facebook was created

00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:48.974
or whether you love
or hate Aaron Sorkin.

00:20:48.974 --> 00:20:50.890
The last seven years are
way more interesting.

00:20:50.890 --> 00:20:52.826
And nobody had written it down.

00:20:52.826 --> 00:20:54.200
And I was there,
so I felt like--

00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:55.180
SPEAKER: Meaning, none of
the other books out there

00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:57.500
had even did not come close
to having the level of--

00:20:57.500 --> 00:20:59.250
MIKE HOEFFLINGER:
Beyond the origin story.

00:20:59.250 --> 00:21:01.410
So certainly "Accidental
Billionaires"

00:21:01.410 --> 00:21:04.660
was written by Ben Mezrich,
which is the source material.

00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:06.670
Ben Mezrich was the
bring the house down, MIT

00:21:06.670 --> 00:21:08.372
card counting dude.

00:21:08.372 --> 00:21:10.820
That led to a good movie.

00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:13.530
And that Mezrich book
was very thinly sourced.

00:21:13.530 --> 00:21:15.790
It was basically sourced
only through interviews

00:21:15.790 --> 00:21:18.130
with the one other
co-founder of Facebook

00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:20.050
that eventually got pushed out.

00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:21.940
And then there was the
David Kirkpatrick--

00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:23.724
he's the former
"Fortune" journalist who

00:21:23.724 --> 00:21:26.140
wrote "Facebook Effect," which
was a very, very good book,

00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:29.530
but essentially ended,
more or less, in 2009.

00:21:29.530 --> 00:21:32.030
But since then, we haven't
written down anything.

00:21:32.030 --> 00:21:34.240
And those stories are,
in my mind, way better.

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:36.650
And I was able to not only
put down what happened,

00:21:36.650 --> 00:21:38.830
but how it happened
and what we can learn.

00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:40.229
SPEAKER: So what can we learn?

00:21:40.229 --> 00:21:41.770
When you look at
"Becoming Facebook,"

00:21:41.770 --> 00:21:45.150
the core of the book, if he
had do a Cliff notes for those

00:21:45.150 --> 00:21:47.086
who were on the video or--

00:21:47.086 --> 00:21:48.960
MIKE HOEFFLINGER: Well,
the core of the book,

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:51.930
to the extent that you've leafed
through the table of contents,

00:21:51.930 --> 00:21:53.730
is kind of the 10
lessons that I took away

00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:56.657
from those seven or eight years
of that unprecedented rise

00:21:56.657 --> 00:21:57.240
that they had.

00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:58.656
And it starts with
the observation

00:21:58.656 --> 00:22:02.760
that I already made, which is,
doing is better than dogma--

00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:03.840
finding your inner Zuck.

00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:05.992
How the hell do you decide--

00:22:05.992 --> 00:22:07.950
forget about whether you
were running a company

00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:09.840
or you're building
a product or you're

00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:11.760
running a small business.

00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:13.932
What is the horizon
of your will to lead?

00:22:13.932 --> 00:22:15.640
You've got to be really
clear about that.

00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:18.202
And it's fine to build
a feature or a product.

00:22:18.202 --> 00:22:20.160
But don't think that you
can go build a mission

00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:22.477
and change the world, which
is something the Jeff Bezos

00:22:22.477 --> 00:22:24.060
and Steve Jobs of
the world are doing,

00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:25.900
and that's going to
take less than 30 years.

00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:28.316
And if you don't have willpower
to get up tomorrow morning

00:22:28.316 --> 00:22:30.120
and ask yourself
if we're done yet,

00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:31.620
then you probably
shouldn't sign up for that.

00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:32.570
So I think you learn that.

00:22:32.570 --> 00:22:34.361
You learn stuff like
don't disrupt yourself

00:22:34.361 --> 00:22:35.970
before somebody else does.

00:22:35.970 --> 00:22:38.400
We can touch on
that a little bit.

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:40.860
You learn simple
stuff like how do you

00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:43.020
win the talent wars
and this notion

00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:46.132
increasingly that we're, I
think, using at more places

00:22:46.132 --> 00:22:48.090
than just Facebook in
Silicon Valley, which is,

00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:50.520
focus on people's
strengths, practically

00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:51.910
ignore their weaknesses.

00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:54.000
Just really focus
on matching what

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.400
people are interested in
to what you ask them to do.

00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:59.079
Get out of the ladder mentality,
because that math doesn't work.

00:22:59.079 --> 00:23:00.870
If the only way that
you're engaged at work

00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:03.750
is by going up to the
next level of the ladder,

00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:05.490
the math doesn't
work, because there's

00:23:05.490 --> 00:23:07.659
a third as many spots on
that part of the ladder

00:23:07.659 --> 00:23:09.450
as there are at the
level that you are now.

00:23:09.450 --> 00:23:13.620
So if you can't keep people
engaged beyond moving them up

00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:14.940
a ladder, then you're screwed.

00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:16.890
And so even just
subtle things like

00:23:16.890 --> 00:23:19.920
that that you don't necessarily
realize outside of the building

00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:22.950
are super crucial lessons.

00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:24.690
Both Google and
Facebook, in my mind,

00:23:24.690 --> 00:23:27.480
are the lenses on
the world today far

00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:29.610
and above anything else
in the world, which

00:23:29.610 --> 00:23:32.280
is a lesson about if you're
going to build something, add

00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:33.545
by subtracting.

00:23:33.545 --> 00:23:34.920
Now that we all
have smartphones,

00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:37.461
we have a piece of glass in our
pocket connected to everyone,

00:23:37.461 --> 00:23:39.750
everything, all the
time, everywhere,

00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:41.280
you don't need more shit.

00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:43.435
You need less shit that
you really care about.

00:23:43.435 --> 00:23:45.060
And if you're building
a product that's

00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:48.420
trying to put more shit in
front of you, just forget it.

00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:52.020
And so I can give you
topics, and you'll

00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:54.089
give me exactly one name
that'll do that for you.

00:23:54.089 --> 00:23:56.130
If I said, "information,"
you will say, "Google."

00:23:56.130 --> 00:23:57.921
If I say, "people,"
you'll say, "Facebook."

00:23:57.921 --> 00:24:02.610
If I say, "places to go
to," you'll say, "Yelp."

00:24:02.610 --> 00:24:05.060
TripAdvisor, Uber--
you do the math.

00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:08.040
There is only ever one answer
for each of these topics,

00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:09.960
because people have
figured out a way

00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:13.530
to make things easier for
us rather than harder.

00:24:13.530 --> 00:24:15.450
SPEAKER: So let me
ask you, in the book,

00:24:15.450 --> 00:24:17.910
you mentioned that Google+ was
doomed three years before it

00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:20.280
ever launched.

00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:21.902
I can comfortably
say, I knew that it

00:24:21.902 --> 00:24:24.360
was doomed five years before
it ever launched [INAUDIBLE]..

00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:26.651
MIKE HOEFFLINGER: It wasn't
an idea five years before--

00:24:26.651 --> 00:24:30.090
SPEAKER: Well, let me contrast
this with the Google Wave

00:24:30.090 --> 00:24:31.740
anecdote where they
should be applauded

00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:33.600
1,000 percent for
doing and 1,000 percent

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:35.979
for shutting it down.

00:24:35.979 --> 00:24:38.520
If you knew there was going to
be doom three years in advance

00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:41.437
of the launch, one, why
would you say it was doomed?

00:24:41.437 --> 00:24:43.770
And two, would you have shut
it down then before it even

00:24:43.770 --> 00:24:46.934
got ahead of steam to kind
of waste that many resources?

00:24:46.934 --> 00:24:48.600
MIKE HOEFFLINGER:
Well, the tricky thing

00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:50.190
with these looking back
things is it's always

00:24:50.190 --> 00:24:51.640
easy to be 20/20 in hindsight.

00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:56.260
But here's why I thought,
looking back on it now,

00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:57.810
it was doomed.

00:24:57.810 --> 00:25:01.110
I really love the book
called "Crossing the Chasm"

00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:01.860
by Geoffrey Moore.

00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:03.750
It's not as popular
now as it used

00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:06.570
to be maybe 10, 15 years
ago in Silicon Valley.

00:25:06.570 --> 00:25:08.550
But it's basically
a book about--

00:25:08.550 --> 00:25:10.680
deep scientific
research about how

00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:12.660
people adopt new technologies.

00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:15.570
And yes, it applies hugely
to consumer technology.

00:25:15.570 --> 00:25:17.070
But it also applies
to other things,

00:25:17.070 --> 00:25:19.500
like this is how
kindergarten went

00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:21.150
from an educational
concept in Germany

00:25:21.150 --> 00:25:24.120
to basically take over the
entire world over in 50 years.

00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:28.380
This is how new seed
plants in the Midwest

00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:30.930
are used by farmers super
rapidly as they come out.

00:25:30.930 --> 00:25:34.080
And it's always this notion that
the innovators will pick it up

00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:36.432
first, and about 2.5%
of your cohort is that.

00:25:36.432 --> 00:25:37.890
Then it will be
the early adopters.

00:25:37.890 --> 00:25:40.170
That's about 12 and 1/2%
of your cohort there.

00:25:40.170 --> 00:25:42.342
Then comes the
giant chasm that you

00:25:42.342 --> 00:25:44.550
have to jump over to get to
the early majority, which

00:25:44.550 --> 00:25:46.330
is another, call it, 25%.

00:25:46.330 --> 00:25:48.510
Then comes late majority
and then the laggards.

00:25:48.510 --> 00:25:51.420
And everything always
happens that way.

00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:53.250
And what you have
to realize is, it's

00:25:53.250 --> 00:25:55.630
very easy to get the innovators
and the early adopters.

00:25:55.630 --> 00:25:58.050
They basically try shit for
the sake of trying shit.

00:25:58.050 --> 00:26:01.060
If you can't get them,
you're super screwed.

00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:03.090
But the early majority
is really only

00:26:03.090 --> 00:26:05.760
when they see all the people
around them using something.

00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:08.220
And when it is really,
truly, pragmatically useful,

00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:10.150
then they will
jump to go use it.

00:26:10.150 --> 00:26:13.410
And if you look at
Facebook in 2009,

00:26:13.410 --> 00:26:17.850
they had gotten to the early
majority of internet users

00:26:17.850 --> 00:26:20.070
that were using
Facebook, if you would

00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:23.850
say the cohort of their target
audience is internet users.

00:26:23.850 --> 00:26:28.530
And so if you're going to build
a product that is essentially

00:26:28.530 --> 00:26:32.130
like Facebook-- and I don't
think that I'm misstating that

00:26:32.130 --> 00:26:37.544
Google+ looked heavily and
behaved heavily like Facebook.

00:26:37.544 --> 00:26:38.460
That's not a judgment.

00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:40.711
I think that's a
fairly fair conclusion.

00:26:40.711 --> 00:26:42.960
If you're going to build
something that is practically

00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:45.550
identical, you do
not want to go up

00:26:45.550 --> 00:26:49.090
against somebody who is already
on the other side of the chasm.

00:26:49.090 --> 00:26:50.620
And that's my issue.

00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:52.931
And I think you ask a
great question, which is,

00:26:52.931 --> 00:26:55.180
you should have built Wave,
because there was no clear

00:26:55.180 --> 00:26:57.513
indicator that it would fail
and it could have been very

00:26:57.513 --> 00:26:59.560
interesting, whereas
with Google+,

00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:01.469
because of the way
that it was defined--

00:27:01.469 --> 00:27:03.760
and a lot of credit to Andy
Hertzfeld, building circles

00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:04.180
and all of that.

00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:04.840
I get it.

00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:06.670
But the way it was
defined, it was

00:27:06.670 --> 00:27:09.100
doomed almost
scientifically, if you

00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:12.440
believe in the crossing
the chasm philosophy.

00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:14.130
And in the book--

00:27:14.130 --> 00:27:16.900
to not only basically
throw this thing out

00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:22.800
like it was doomed three
years earlier, to me,

00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:24.816
the thing you should
have leveraged

00:27:24.816 --> 00:27:26.440
was Gmail, which you
tried, because you

00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:27.650
put an extension on Gmail.

00:27:27.650 --> 00:27:29.530
I forget now what it was called.

00:27:29.530 --> 00:27:32.800
But I think that was the tool
that, if you had built it

00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:34.840
in a way that wasn't
trying to be totally

00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:36.940
identical to Facebook
but was trying to do more

00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:39.370
with the network that Gmail
already understood-- all

00:27:39.370 --> 00:27:41.120
of the people that
you're sending email to

00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:43.130
is the connections that
Facebook was building.

00:27:43.130 --> 00:27:44.950
There was an opportunity
there, which,

00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:47.392
I think because you slightly
misstepped on the extension

00:27:47.392 --> 00:27:49.600
that you had built into
Gmail, which I think you even

00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:51.010
got your hand legally slapped--

00:27:51.010 --> 00:27:54.222
I forget exactly what went down.

00:27:54.222 --> 00:27:55.930
But that would have
been the opportunity,

00:27:55.930 --> 00:27:59.560
whereas Google+ was defined--

00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:01.360
I don't want to go
too far and actually

00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:03.250
take it all the way back to
the leader of that effort who

00:28:03.250 --> 00:28:04.294
came from Microsoft.

00:28:04.294 --> 00:28:05.710
And I wonder if
that was an issue.

00:28:05.710 --> 00:28:07.085
And I don't know
him well enough.

00:28:07.085 --> 00:28:08.012
AUDIENCE: It's OK.

00:28:08.012 --> 00:28:09.470
MIKE HOEFFLINGER:
But I'm on video,

00:28:09.470 --> 00:28:12.790
so I got to be
careful what I say.

00:28:12.790 --> 00:28:14.540
Because I think that
is a great question--

00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:16.498
there are some things
that you shouldn't start,

00:28:16.498 --> 00:28:18.430
because you should know
enough that that is

00:28:18.430 --> 00:28:19.941
going to be a very long shot.

00:28:19.941 --> 00:28:21.940
And there are some things
that you should start,

00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:23.870
even if you don't know
how it's going to go.

00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:26.796
SPEAKER: So when you look
at companies like Facebook

00:28:26.796 --> 00:28:28.670
in particular, are they
always on the lookout

00:28:28.670 --> 00:28:29.650
for self-disruption?

00:28:29.650 --> 00:28:31.600
Or is it just something which
they say one day, today we're

00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:33.870
going to start, something
has happened in the business,

00:28:33.870 --> 00:28:35.703
we have to start looking
to disrupt ourself?

00:28:35.703 --> 00:28:38.422
Is it a constant mindset among
the leadership team or even

00:28:38.422 --> 00:28:39.505
those who are working on--

00:28:39.505 --> 00:28:42.504
MIKE HOEFFLINGER: I
think it's got to be,

00:28:42.504 --> 00:28:44.170
because the only thing
you know for sure

00:28:44.170 --> 00:28:46.720
from historical records is that
even the greatest technology

00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:48.654
companies don't last forever.

00:28:48.654 --> 00:28:50.320
You and I are both
not at Intel anymore,

00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:51.778
and that's kind of
not an accident.

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:57.550
One of the great miracles
of pulling out of a nosedive

00:28:57.550 --> 00:28:59.770
is maybe what Satya
is doing at Microsoft.

00:28:59.770 --> 00:29:01.810
But in the Ballmer era--

00:29:01.810 --> 00:29:04.870
again, obviously a much
bigger, better executive than I

00:29:04.870 --> 00:29:08.760
ever was, so not to pick on him,
but that wasn't going so well.

00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:11.611
And Microsoft-- I'm not 100%
sure-- is not out of the woods

00:29:11.611 --> 00:29:12.110
yet.

00:29:12.110 --> 00:29:14.401
But that's like one of the
all-time great like pull-ups

00:29:14.401 --> 00:29:14.940
ever.

00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:16.594
But historically--

00:29:16.594 --> 00:29:18.010
AUDIENCE: You can't
forget iPhone.

00:29:18.010 --> 00:29:18.885
MIKE HOEFFLINGER: No.

00:29:18.885 --> 00:29:20.410
And by the way, I think--

00:29:20.410 --> 00:29:24.970
oh, man, how am I going to put
myself on the record with--

00:29:24.970 --> 00:29:28.210
I just can't keep
myself from saying it.

00:29:28.210 --> 00:29:31.750
And by the way, I think they
are indeterminant right now.

00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:33.720
I think Tim is doing
a phenomenal job

00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:36.220
working the numbers, which is
exactly what his history would

00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:36.820
suggest.

00:29:36.820 --> 00:29:40.690
He was COO of Compaq, had
an incredible reputation

00:29:40.690 --> 00:29:42.120
there for managing the numbers.

00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:43.660
He is doing that well.

00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:45.290
What he is not doing
so well-- and I

00:29:45.290 --> 00:29:47.665
don't think I'm going out on
a limb here-- is innovating.

00:29:47.665 --> 00:29:49.030
So I hope he's working on some--

00:29:49.030 --> 00:29:50.155
AUDIENCE: What about Steve?

00:29:50.155 --> 00:29:52.500
I'm talking about
Steve [INAUDIBLE]..

00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:55.210
MIKE HOEFFLINGER: And Steve 2.0
was like an all-time comeback.

00:29:55.210 --> 00:29:59.700
And it's such a shame that we
didn't get to see Steve 3.0.

00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:01.180
That's all I'll say about that.

00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:10.180
You have to constantly
be thinking,

00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:11.380
how could I disrupt myself?

00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:13.210
Because you know
someone somewhere

00:30:13.210 --> 00:30:17.350
is doing it, especially
because that's how you grew up.

00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:19.780
There was 21 of you
down in Palo Alto.

00:30:19.780 --> 00:30:23.937
And you beat the living shit
out of Yahoo, Microsoft,

00:30:23.937 --> 00:30:24.520
and everybody.

00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:28.030
So if you can do it,
somebody can do it to you.

00:30:28.030 --> 00:30:31.120
And so you have to-- if
you're Larry, Sundar, Mark,

00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:35.230
Cheryl, you have to believe
that there is somebody who

00:30:35.230 --> 00:30:39.010
is out there trying
to beat you, even

00:30:39.010 --> 00:30:40.714
if it's Evan Spiegel in LA.

00:30:40.714 --> 00:30:42.130
And maybe you think
he's a douche.

00:30:42.130 --> 00:30:42.796
Maybe you don't.

00:30:42.796 --> 00:30:43.570
How do I put--

00:30:43.570 --> 00:30:45.670
this is the worst.

00:30:45.670 --> 00:30:48.010
I clearly have to take the
Gary Vaynerchuk approach now,

00:30:48.010 --> 00:30:49.801
which is like, I'm
burning this thing down.

00:30:56.290 --> 00:30:57.010
Oh, my god.

00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:01.950
You'll remember this moment.

00:31:01.950 --> 00:31:04.132
SPEAKER: So let's--

00:31:04.132 --> 00:31:05.840
I forgot the question
I was going to ask.

00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:06.850
Damn you.

00:31:06.850 --> 00:31:08.070
That's not good.

00:31:08.070 --> 00:31:10.422
MIKE HOEFFLINGER: You have
to believe somebody is

00:31:10.422 --> 00:31:11.630
going to disrupt you somehow.

00:31:11.630 --> 00:31:13.210
SPEAKER: So on
that note also, do

00:31:13.210 --> 00:31:15.250
you think Mark has an
unfair advantage in that,

00:31:15.250 --> 00:31:17.410
because he has this network?

00:31:17.410 --> 00:31:19.990
He has inside information
on what's kind of bubbling.

00:31:19.990 --> 00:31:23.260
So with Instagram
or WhatsApp, he

00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:25.360
has user data that
no one else has.

00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:27.640
So he can say, Instagram
is a bargain at a billion,

00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:30.010
even when everyone
thought he overpaid.

00:31:30.010 --> 00:31:32.180
And he can say, it's a
bargain at 14 for WhatsApp

00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:33.942
when everyone else was
saying at the time,

00:31:33.942 --> 00:31:35.650
it sounds like a
ludicrously high number.

00:31:35.650 --> 00:31:37.316
But now if you look
back, you say, well,

00:31:37.316 --> 00:31:41.290
that was, again, of
all things, a bargain.

00:31:41.290 --> 00:31:42.790
So does he have
inside information?

00:31:42.790 --> 00:31:44.800
Or is it just kind of
pure being that good?

00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:46.060
MIKE HOEFFLINGER: He doesn't
have inside information

00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:47.920
in the legal form or that word.

00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:50.920
But you mentioned Instagram,
for example, which, of course,

00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:53.650
at a minimum, was using Facebook
log-in and also, in a way,

00:31:53.650 --> 00:31:55.570
actually was
connected to the API.

00:31:55.570 --> 00:31:57.970
So Mark, who actually
knew, of course,

00:31:57.970 --> 00:31:59.500
Kevin Systrom for years--

00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:01.240
the CEO of Instagram--
before that.

00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:02.860
They had a personal
relationship.

00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:04.900
They had met long before that.

00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:07.427
Mark knew much more than
what was publicly available

00:32:07.427 --> 00:32:09.010
about Instagram,
which is occasionally

00:32:09.010 --> 00:32:11.600
Kevin and Mike would update
on how many users they have--

00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:14.620
we've got 10 million-- but
very, very, very occasionally.

00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:18.040
But what Mark knew because of
Facebook log-in and other kind

00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:21.250
of data that was coming through
the Facebook API completely

00:32:21.250 --> 00:32:22.680
legally, because--

00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:23.980
SPEAKER: It's their API.

00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:27.070
MIKE HOEFFLINGER: Kevin and
Mike were using the API.

00:32:27.070 --> 00:32:28.600
He knew much more
about the degree

00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:30.820
of engagement, which
is the kind of almost

00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:33.710
daily use, the amount of time.

00:32:33.710 --> 00:32:35.350
And he could pattern match.

00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:37.910
I've seen this movie
Instagram before.

00:32:37.910 --> 00:32:40.270
It might only be 5 million,
10 million, 12 million,

00:32:40.270 --> 00:32:41.067
18 million users.

00:32:41.067 --> 00:32:42.400
But I've seen this movie before.

00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:43.912
It's us.

00:32:43.912 --> 00:32:46.120
And at the time, he was
starting to think much bigger

00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:48.640
than we realized, which
is Facebook doesn't just

00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:50.740
equal Facebook, the
app, which is Facebook

00:32:50.740 --> 00:32:53.371
equals the mission of making the
world more open and connected.

00:32:53.371 --> 00:32:55.120
And if we could work
together with Kevin--

00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:59.200
not like acqui-hire him and
have him build more Facebook--

00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:00.610
but bring in
Instagram because it

00:33:00.610 --> 00:33:03.430
was another method by which
people connected and shared--

00:33:03.430 --> 00:33:05.570
he knew more than
the rest of us did.

00:33:05.570 --> 00:33:07.760
And so when Kevin
called him and said,

00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:11.050
hey, we're about to take
more money at a $500 million

00:33:11.050 --> 00:33:12.120
valuation--

00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:14.957
he called him on a Friday
afternoon-- on Monday morning--

00:33:14.957 --> 00:33:15.790
Zuck calls him back.

00:33:15.790 --> 00:33:17.350
He's says, come
over to my place.

00:33:17.350 --> 00:33:19.570
And on Saturday, he's like, I'm
going offering you a billion.

00:33:19.570 --> 00:33:21.486
Why don't you come over
here, we will make you

00:33:21.486 --> 00:33:23.560
much bigger than you are now.

00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:27.430
And Kevin is like, oh, yeah, OK.

00:33:27.430 --> 00:33:29.470
And that's just the billion.

00:33:29.470 --> 00:33:31.360
And then both of
them proved to have

00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:33.250
made an excellent
decision, because Kevin

00:33:33.250 --> 00:33:35.583
was able to continue to build
the product that he loved,

00:33:35.583 --> 00:33:36.880
that he really cared about.

00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:39.400
And he was able to
do it without having

00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:43.600
to worry about the massive
infrastructure issues that

00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:45.970
are behind that, because
Zuck and the team

00:33:45.970 --> 00:33:47.080
were able to help him.

00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:49.300
And then, of course,
once you've done that,

00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:50.830
then you can get really good--

00:33:50.830 --> 00:33:53.121
when you sit down with Jan
Koum, who had built WhatsApp

00:33:53.121 --> 00:33:55.810
to 400 million users, you can
look at Jan and you can say,

00:33:55.810 --> 00:33:58.360
hey, look how we helped Kevin.

00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:01.684
And then Jan can be like,
OK, I get what you're saying.

00:34:01.684 --> 00:34:03.100
There is a proof
point that you're

00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:05.266
going to leave me alone and
build the thing that I'm

00:34:05.266 --> 00:34:09.370
dreaming about and help me
with the stuff that's hard.

00:34:09.370 --> 00:34:11.880
This way, Jan didn't have
to worry about monetization.

00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:14.881
And so he did know more.

00:34:14.881 --> 00:34:16.630
And I think the same
is true for you guys.

00:34:16.630 --> 00:34:19.540
I don't know all the data
that you guys are sitting on.

00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:22.780
But the world is telling you
every day what it cares about.

00:34:22.780 --> 00:34:24.560
So you should have
a better perspective

00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:28.150
on pretty much
anything than anyone,

00:34:28.150 --> 00:34:32.440
in terms of having data
to back up your instincts

00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:33.639
about the future.

00:34:33.639 --> 00:34:36.310
SPEAKER: So when
you look at what's

00:34:36.310 --> 00:34:39.261
next, from the standpoint of,
what might cause disruption

00:34:39.261 --> 00:34:41.719
to a Facebook or a Google, what
is the next big opportunity

00:34:41.719 --> 00:34:44.790
that you're seeing when you
look out two, three, four years?

00:34:44.790 --> 00:34:47.760
We're on the record saying,
[INAUDIBLE] first company

00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:49.031
at this point.

00:34:49.031 --> 00:34:50.739
But when you see,
[INAUDIBLE] on your own

00:34:50.739 --> 00:34:52.457
experience from
having been at Intel,

00:34:52.457 --> 00:34:54.790
having been at Facebook, being
a student of technology--

00:34:54.790 --> 00:34:56.770
what would you look at when
you look at a few years down?

00:34:56.770 --> 00:34:59.080
MIKE HOEFFLINGER: Well, you'll
totally remember a thing

00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:01.330
that Andy Grove
used to love to say,

00:35:01.330 --> 00:35:03.775
which is, market share is
won and lost in transitions.

00:35:03.775 --> 00:35:04.550
You remember that?

00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:05.380
SPEAKER: Yep.

00:35:05.380 --> 00:35:07.630
MIKE HOEFFLINGER:
And he would always

00:35:07.630 --> 00:35:11.365
tell the OEMs that to encourage
them to use a new Intel chip.

00:35:11.365 --> 00:35:13.490
So ti was clearly a very
self-serving thing to say,

00:35:13.490 --> 00:35:14.500
but it's totally true.

00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:16.369
And we're in the
best period, to me--

00:35:16.369 --> 00:35:17.910
I've been in Silicon
Valley 25 years.

00:35:17.910 --> 00:35:20.620
We're in the best period,
which is top of one s-curve--

00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:23.950
and you're a room I don't
need to explain s-curves to.

00:35:23.950 --> 00:35:26.641
And what I mean by that is
kind of mobile, social, comms,

00:35:26.641 --> 00:35:27.640
info-- blah, blah, blah.

00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:29.020
We're at the top
of that s-curve.

00:35:29.020 --> 00:35:30.730
Everybody done
and done has that.

00:35:30.730 --> 00:35:34.027
And we're not yet into the
bend on the next s-curve.

00:35:34.027 --> 00:35:35.860
So it feels a little
bit like a lull-- like,

00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:37.050
what the hell's going on?

00:35:37.050 --> 00:35:38.830
Is anything new happening?

00:35:38.830 --> 00:35:40.990
And that, to me, is
my favorite period,

00:35:40.990 --> 00:35:43.840
because the shit is
about to get real.

00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:45.746
And I think to me,
there's clearly

00:35:45.746 --> 00:35:46.870
three categories of stuff--

00:35:46.870 --> 00:35:47.870
AI, for sure.

00:35:47.870 --> 00:35:47.950
SPEAKER: Yep.

00:35:47.950 --> 00:35:49.783
MIKE HOEFFLINGER: Not
as an end game, but as

00:35:49.783 --> 00:35:52.060
a thing that makes the
stuff we build way better.

00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:53.900
Everybody's like, AI's coming.

00:35:53.900 --> 00:35:54.430
Bullshit.

00:35:54.430 --> 00:35:55.584
It's already here.

00:35:55.584 --> 00:35:56.750
It makes my searches better.

00:35:56.750 --> 00:35:57.970
It makes my news feed better.

00:35:57.970 --> 00:35:59.957
It makes my understanding
pictures better.

00:35:59.957 --> 00:36:01.040
It will make video better.

00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:03.070
And then, of course,
maybe we'll do assistance

00:36:03.070 --> 00:36:04.100
on top of all of that.

00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:04.990
I'm not 100% sure.

00:36:04.990 --> 00:36:07.900
But it's kind of, to the
first order, already here,

00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:09.880
but thinking greedy and
to make stuff better,

00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:15.190
not robots that run down the
hallway and cook you breakfast.

00:36:15.190 --> 00:36:16.905
That, I don't know.

00:36:16.905 --> 00:36:18.280
By the way, they're
going to keep

00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:19.988
trying to make
intelligent refrigerators.

00:36:19.988 --> 00:36:23.150
We just got to stop doing that.

00:36:23.150 --> 00:36:24.575
And next thing, I do think--

00:36:24.575 --> 00:36:25.950
you were bagging
on this earlier,

00:36:25.950 --> 00:36:27.440
so I'll wade into it anyway.

00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:29.650
But I do think
augmented reality--

00:36:29.650 --> 00:36:32.500
and not as a repla--

00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:35.500
everybody is like, oh,
clearly, augmented reality

00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:36.760
will replace the phone.

00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:38.477
I think that is ridiculous.

00:36:38.477 --> 00:36:40.060
What's going to
happen is you're going

00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:41.230
to keep this in your pocket.

00:36:41.230 --> 00:36:43.660
And it's going to be
your connect and compute.

00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:47.200
And you're going to have these,
which are going to be your IO.

00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:51.510
And the ability lay information
over your real world--

00:36:51.510 --> 00:36:55.390
not in a goofy-ass, there's a
robot down there and I'm going

00:36:55.390 --> 00:36:57.005
to shoot it with
my imaginary gun--

00:36:57.005 --> 00:36:59.380
not that I'm saying that it's
not good for entertainment.

00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:01.930
But I think there is going to
be some very interesting stuff

00:37:01.930 --> 00:37:04.822
there, not as a
displacement of mobile,

00:37:04.822 --> 00:37:06.280
but I think as a,
if you will, like

00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:08.050
a demand regeneration for it.

00:37:08.050 --> 00:37:11.580
Now the interesting thing
there is the landlords--

00:37:11.580 --> 00:37:13.450
so Android and iOS--

00:37:13.450 --> 00:37:16.870
may shift here, unless
the current landlords

00:37:16.870 --> 00:37:19.935
do a great job of
shifting to the new.

00:37:19.935 --> 00:37:21.310
And then, of course
everybody who

00:37:21.310 --> 00:37:23.682
operates on top of what
the landlords are running

00:37:23.682 --> 00:37:25.390
needs to pay attention,
because the truth

00:37:25.390 --> 00:37:28.600
is, Facebook is running--

00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:33.520
has two landlords that really
control their situation, which

00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:35.260
is the T's and C's
of the Play Store

00:37:35.260 --> 00:37:37.240
and the App Store
control Facebook's world.

00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:40.000
You guys could write T's
and C's tomorrow that say,

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.887
if you want to
run on Google Play

00:37:42.887 --> 00:37:44.470
and you want to do
advertising, you've

00:37:44.470 --> 00:37:47.350
got to use Google's native
systems and I take 30%.

00:37:47.350 --> 00:37:51.220
You guys could write those
T's and C's tomorrow morning

00:37:51.220 --> 00:37:55.890
and Facebook would lose 30% of
their revenue tomorrow night.

00:37:55.890 --> 00:37:57.450
Fact.

00:37:57.450 --> 00:38:00.310
Now government might come
after you for anti-trust--

00:38:00.310 --> 00:38:02.194
not 100% sure.

00:38:02.194 --> 00:38:03.610
But the reason
that doesn't happen

00:38:03.610 --> 00:38:05.980
is because there's mutual
assured destruction

00:38:05.980 --> 00:38:08.110
between Android,
iOS, and Facebook.

00:38:08.110 --> 00:38:11.770
There's no way that Google Play
and App Store can fundamentally

00:38:11.770 --> 00:38:14.170
fuck with Facebook's
apps, because they're

00:38:14.170 --> 00:38:16.990
the most popular shit
on your platform.

00:38:16.990 --> 00:38:19.180
And it's a very
delicate balance.

00:38:19.180 --> 00:38:21.040
And you've got to
really look at how

00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:23.050
the situation of
landlords and tenants

00:38:23.050 --> 00:38:25.019
changes as media changes.

00:38:25.019 --> 00:38:26.560
It was one of the
fundamental reasons

00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:29.200
that Facebook picked up Oculus.

00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:32.530
Zuck needs a playing
chip in this chess game

00:38:32.530 --> 00:38:35.200
that's going to get played
in augmented reality

00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:36.120
in the next two years.

00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:37.660
2019, by the way--

00:38:37.660 --> 00:38:41.290
Christmas 2019, watch
for massive food

00:38:41.290 --> 00:38:46.520
fight in totally legit consumer
AR, triggered by Microsoft.

00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:47.020
SPEAKER: OK.

00:38:47.020 --> 00:38:49.960
We'll keep an eye out for it.

00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:51.760
In terms of top of
the s-curve, if you're

00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:56.219
looking at the current adoption
of smartphones globally,

00:38:56.219 --> 00:38:58.510
what thought do you give to
the next two billion users?

00:38:58.510 --> 00:39:01.176
When you look at the two billion
folks that will never own a TV,

00:39:01.176 --> 00:39:02.934
never own a PC,
never own a tablet--

00:39:02.934 --> 00:39:04.600
they might own a
feature phone, but they

00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:06.180
might own a smartphone.

00:39:06.180 --> 00:39:08.800
What opportunities
are presented, if any,

00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:09.670
by that segment?

00:39:09.670 --> 00:39:12.490
And should it be a focus
for companies like Facebook

00:39:12.490 --> 00:39:14.890
and others, given that
monetization prospects are

00:39:14.890 --> 00:39:15.430
slim?

00:39:15.430 --> 00:39:19.230
Not many advertisers,
not much [INAUDIBLE]----

00:39:19.230 --> 00:39:21.460
it's serving a good and
you're getting services out,

00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:23.697
but how much of a focus
should it command?

00:39:23.697 --> 00:39:25.780
MIKE HOEFFLINGER: Well,
it's fascinating, I think,

00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:29.500
to watch the different players
on this topic right now.

00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:31.120
As I say in the
book, at some point,

00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:33.421
Zuck had to stand up
in front of his board--

00:39:33.421 --> 00:39:35.170
which is cursory, by
the way, because they

00:39:35.170 --> 00:39:37.560
don't have control over him--

00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:40.134
and say, I want to put a
lot of money for a long time

00:39:40.134 --> 00:39:42.550
into something that's going
to be the most difficult thing

00:39:42.550 --> 00:39:46.360
that we do with totally
uncertain outcomes that

00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:51.135
will monetize, best case, at
1/10 per person as the US.

00:39:51.135 --> 00:39:53.260
And the board had to look
at him and be like, yeah,

00:39:53.260 --> 00:39:54.880
that sounds fine.

00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:58.342
Drones the size of 737s that
weigh as much as a Prius that

00:39:58.342 --> 00:40:00.800
stay in the air for 90 days
and get their energy from solar

00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:01.820
seems like a great idea.

00:40:01.820 --> 00:40:05.440
We should totally put those
up above Africa and India

00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:07.420
and Southeast Asia.

00:40:07.420 --> 00:40:12.140
And you see that Zuck is
very serious about that.

00:40:12.140 --> 00:40:15.130
He really, really does want
to connect the next n billion

00:40:15.130 --> 00:40:16.840
people and way beyond--

00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:19.540
we live here in LTE land.

00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:21.899
And we don't understand
that only 30% of India

00:40:21.899 --> 00:40:22.690
is on the internet.

00:40:22.690 --> 00:40:26.030
We don't understand that
there is places in Indonesia

00:40:26.030 --> 00:40:28.630
that there are days where
they have enough money

00:40:28.630 --> 00:40:31.534
to spend on data, and then
there's days and days and days

00:40:31.534 --> 00:40:33.700
and days and days where
they don't have enough money

00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:34.464
to spend on data.

00:40:34.464 --> 00:40:36.130
And we don't know
that there is actually

00:40:36.130 --> 00:40:42.160
places where people may have
a phone before they have power

00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:44.530
and clean water.

00:40:44.530 --> 00:40:46.031
So Zuck is super
serious about this.

00:40:46.031 --> 00:40:47.988
My sense, looking at you
guys from the outside,

00:40:47.988 --> 00:40:49.870
is that you guys are
super serious about it,

00:40:49.870 --> 00:40:52.330
which clearly isn't because
of the monetization potential.

00:40:52.330 --> 00:40:53.930
The data is very clear.

00:40:53.930 --> 00:40:57.410
It's just like, Zuck has decided
this is important in the world.

00:40:57.410 --> 00:41:00.880
And he's going to go do
what he can down that road.

00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:02.421
You guys feel to me like--

00:41:02.421 --> 00:41:03.670
I feel the same from you guys.

00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:07.090
Android, in my mind, is one
of the great fundamentally

00:41:07.090 --> 00:41:09.610
enabling technologies
in the space.

00:41:09.610 --> 00:41:12.460
And everybody says, Apple gets
all the profits in this space

00:41:12.460 --> 00:41:14.440
and Android gets all
the market share.

00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:17.620
I think Google Facebook
deserve a ton of credit

00:41:17.620 --> 00:41:22.150
for showing that they care
about this way beyond money.

00:41:22.150 --> 00:41:24.580
When you look at Apple,
not so clear to me

00:41:24.580 --> 00:41:27.474
whether Tim Cook cares about
the next two billion people

00:41:27.474 --> 00:41:28.390
that aren't connected.

00:41:28.390 --> 00:41:30.760
Not accusing him of not
being, but it's not clear.

00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:31.932
It's not evident.

00:41:31.932 --> 00:41:33.640
And then you look at
somebody like Evan--

00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:35.640
and I hate to pick on
Evan, because he's clearly

00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:37.630
building the MTV of right now.

00:41:37.630 --> 00:41:39.680
And you have to give
him credit for that.

00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:43.620
But Evan has essentially said,
I don't care about India.

00:41:43.620 --> 00:41:45.842
I think he might have
literally said that.

00:41:45.842 --> 00:41:47.550
But he's very clear
that his strategy is,

00:41:47.550 --> 00:41:49.341
I'm never going to grow
as big as Facebook,

00:41:49.341 --> 00:41:52.140
I'm going to go for massive
ARPU in the Western world.

00:41:52.140 --> 00:41:54.250
That's what Evan has
said, which, by the way,

00:41:54.250 --> 00:41:54.750
is a good strategy.

00:41:54.750 --> 00:41:56.270
There's no way that he'll
be as big as Facebook,

00:41:56.270 --> 00:41:57.990
so you've got to go
deep and do ARPU.

00:41:57.990 --> 00:42:00.240
But he has, either by his
action or through his words,

00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:02.670
essentially said, I don't
care about the unconnected,

00:42:02.670 --> 00:42:05.902
and I actually don't
even care about the lower

00:42:05.902 --> 00:42:07.110
percentiles of the connected.

00:42:07.110 --> 00:42:09.840
So you just watch the
actions of these companies.

00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:13.120
And you see what their
intent in the world is.

00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:15.000
And sometimes their
intent is totally related

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:16.320
to revenue and profitability.

00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:17.880
And sometimes it totally isn't.

00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:20.790
But I do think that
there's so many people

00:42:20.790 --> 00:42:23.520
outside of the bubble that
look at Google and Facebook

00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:26.480
and just like, oh, my god,
it's not real in my world,

00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:28.230
and you guys are all
just about the money.

00:42:28.230 --> 00:42:30.870
And you just can't look
at Google and Facebook

00:42:30.870 --> 00:42:33.270
in particular and accuse
them, in this case,

00:42:33.270 --> 00:42:37.470
of being about the money,
because chasing low-end Android

00:42:37.470 --> 00:42:39.090
and connecting the
unconnected is not

00:42:39.090 --> 00:42:41.420
a great business right now.

00:42:41.420 --> 00:42:44.220
AUDIENCE: So in addition
to vision execution,

00:42:44.220 --> 00:42:46.900
how much of a role do you think
luck plays for these luminaries

00:42:46.900 --> 00:42:49.150
that you mentioned?

00:42:49.150 --> 00:42:51.150
MIKE HOEFFLINGER: I think
it's impossible to say

00:42:51.150 --> 00:42:53.130
that it doesn't play a role.

00:42:53.130 --> 00:42:55.470
Absolutely, you have to be
able to see around a corner.

00:42:55.470 --> 00:42:57.142
You have to time it well.

00:42:57.142 --> 00:42:59.100
You have to have the guts
to go after something

00:42:59.100 --> 00:43:00.474
that other people
think is crazy.

00:43:00.474 --> 00:43:02.550
You have to be able to
execute well tomorrow.

00:43:02.550 --> 00:43:05.850
I do think you have to get a
little bit lucky, for sure.

00:43:05.850 --> 00:43:08.280
You look at Facebook,
for example.

00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:12.600
Mark wrote the
Facebook.com in 2004,

00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:15.105
totally web-based,
of course, which

00:43:15.105 --> 00:43:18.960
is only thing that he really
could build at that time.

00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:21.540
And it was 2006 that
we got News Feed, which

00:43:21.540 --> 00:43:23.631
was the fundamental
breakthrough, if you will,

00:43:23.631 --> 00:43:25.380
of the Facebook user
experience, that they

00:43:25.380 --> 00:43:27.180
built because they
saw people pecking

00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:28.722
around people's profiles.

00:43:28.722 --> 00:43:30.180
And they're like,
oh, my god, we've

00:43:30.180 --> 00:43:32.554
got to build one place where
you just see all this stuff,

00:43:32.554 --> 00:43:34.630
and then we'll filter
it a little bit.

00:43:34.630 --> 00:43:37.590
But even that was the
year before iPhone,

00:43:37.590 --> 00:43:40.260
which they probably sold
a couple of million units.

00:43:40.260 --> 00:43:44.580
And then they were in just
perfectly beautiful position,

00:43:44.580 --> 00:43:47.400
because News Feed itself was
a vertically scrolling column

00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:51.300
of bite-sized information
that, looking back on,

00:43:51.300 --> 00:43:53.760
is like, it's
perfect for mobile.

00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:56.100
You literally couldn't have
invented a better thing

00:43:56.100 --> 00:43:58.750
for mobile, except they
did it before mobile.

00:43:58.750 --> 00:44:02.490
And so the fact that they
built Facebook in 2004,

00:44:02.490 --> 00:44:03.960
then they built
News Feed in 2006,

00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:06.630
and then they had this perfect
confluence with mobile--

00:44:06.630 --> 00:44:10.080
even Chris Cox, who is an
awesome Chief Product Officer,

00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:12.860
would not tell you that he had
that whole thing figured out.

00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:15.360
And it was a perfect fit that
came together beautifully

00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:16.010
for them.

00:44:16.010 --> 00:44:17.510
And even Chris,
Mark, I think, would

00:44:17.510 --> 00:44:19.854
say that was a piece
of good fortune.

00:44:19.854 --> 00:44:21.270
AUDIENCE: Do you
have any insights

00:44:21.270 --> 00:44:24.230
on the tension between
Google as being

00:44:24.230 --> 00:44:27.570
the gateway to the
open web and the rise

00:44:27.570 --> 00:44:30.850
of these closed-off platforms,
like Facebook, Instagram,

00:44:30.850 --> 00:44:33.320
Snapchat, and if you
see any kind of threats

00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:35.157
or opportunities
within that space?

00:44:35.157 --> 00:44:37.240
MIKE HOEFFLINGER: That's
an interesting, actually,

00:44:37.240 --> 00:44:38.340
distinction between the two.

00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:39.380
The way that I always think--

00:44:39.380 --> 00:44:42.007
I think Google and Facebook are
kind of the defining companies

00:44:42.007 --> 00:44:44.340
right now, because they simply
are the lenses between us

00:44:44.340 --> 00:44:45.149
and our world.

00:44:45.149 --> 00:44:46.690
If you know what
you're looking for--

00:44:46.690 --> 00:44:47.580
I'm going to oversimplify
a little bit--

00:44:47.580 --> 00:44:49.350
if you know what you're
looking for, you go to Google.

00:44:49.350 --> 00:44:50.880
If you don't know what you're
looking for-- you kind of just

00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:52.290
want to know what the
hell's going on-- you

00:44:52.290 --> 00:44:53.482
go to Facebook's products.

00:44:53.482 --> 00:44:54.690
That's an oversimplification.

00:44:54.690 --> 00:44:58.470
But clearly, head and shoulders
above anybody else, that's

00:44:58.470 --> 00:45:01.140
how I think of the two of them.

00:45:01.140 --> 00:45:03.750
I think a user in
Chicago who doesn't

00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:06.250
sit in rooms like this doesn't
think about open web, closed

00:45:06.250 --> 00:45:06.750
web.

00:45:06.750 --> 00:45:08.750
I don't think that's a
thing for them, actually.

00:45:08.750 --> 00:45:10.530
I think they just
care about stuff

00:45:10.530 --> 00:45:13.140
that they want to get done
in their life and people

00:45:13.140 --> 00:45:14.550
and things that they care about.

00:45:14.550 --> 00:45:16.465
And I think that's
how they think.

00:45:16.465 --> 00:45:18.090
I think if we introduce
this notion of,

00:45:18.090 --> 00:45:21.360
do you realize Google is open
and Facebook is closed-ish,

00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:24.762
they'd be like, I don't
understand what that means.

00:45:24.762 --> 00:45:26.970
And so I think you have to
ask yourself-- opportunity

00:45:26.970 --> 00:45:29.280
and threat, I think,
is always mostly

00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:30.900
what do people care
about, as opposed

00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:33.270
to constructs that
we'll invent here,

00:45:33.270 --> 00:45:34.500
which are totally relevant.

00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:35.280
You sit in rooms.

00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:36.540
And you discuss this
kind of strategy.

00:45:36.540 --> 00:45:38.350
You have to think about
that kind of stuff.

00:45:38.350 --> 00:45:39.990
But I don't think that's
how people actually think.

00:45:39.990 --> 00:45:41.364
And so I think
you've got to just

00:45:41.364 --> 00:45:43.530
be obsessed about what
people are telling you,

00:45:43.530 --> 00:45:45.905
by virtue of what they're
doing with your products, which

00:45:45.905 --> 00:45:47.940
is why it's so important
that you try things,

00:45:47.940 --> 00:45:52.470
because that allows
people to provide you

00:45:52.470 --> 00:45:55.530
with insight about how
they're using those things.

00:45:55.530 --> 00:45:58.574
And so I think opportunities
and threats simply come from,

00:45:58.574 --> 00:46:00.240
are you giving people
enough opportunity

00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:02.250
to tell you what they want?

00:46:02.250 --> 00:46:04.620
AUDIENCE: Why hasn't
somebody bought Twitter yet?

00:46:04.620 --> 00:46:05.580
SPEAKER: Oh, I was
hoping somebody

00:46:05.580 --> 00:46:06.580
would ask that question.

00:46:11.167 --> 00:46:12.750
MIKE HOEFFLINGER:
This meeting is just

00:46:12.750 --> 00:46:15.040
a phenomenal opportunity to
completely light my career

00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:18.600
on fire and in not a good way--

00:46:21.700 --> 00:46:23.211
whatever career I have left.

00:46:25.924 --> 00:46:27.090
So what's my first instinct?

00:46:27.090 --> 00:46:27.589
It's funny.

00:46:27.589 --> 00:46:29.340
I was talking to a
reporter yesterday.

00:46:29.340 --> 00:46:31.582
And she actually drew a
very interesting distinction

00:46:31.582 --> 00:46:32.790
between Twitter and Facebook.

00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:36.030
She said, Facebook
is the place I

00:46:36.030 --> 00:46:37.650
go to connect with
the people I know,

00:46:37.650 --> 00:46:40.320
and Twitter is the place I go to
connect with the people I wish

00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:43.177
I knew, which I
thought was interesting

00:46:43.177 --> 00:46:45.260
and I think which actually
tells you a little bit.

00:46:45.260 --> 00:46:46.670
I think the human
condition is we

00:46:46.670 --> 00:46:48.969
want to be connected to
the people that we know.

00:46:48.969 --> 00:46:51.260
And I think the size difference
of Facebook and Twitter

00:46:51.260 --> 00:46:53.612
tells you exactly how
much passion there

00:46:53.612 --> 00:46:55.070
is for connecting
to people that we

00:46:55.070 --> 00:46:58.160
wish we know versus people
that we actually do know.

00:46:58.160 --> 00:47:02.570
And I think Twitter is in the
purgatory of the in-between,

00:47:02.570 --> 00:47:03.470
clearly.

00:47:03.470 --> 00:47:07.280
They are neither
Facebook nor Snapchat.

00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:09.440
They're not big
enough to be Facebook

00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:14.150
and to reap the benefits
of giving advertisers

00:47:14.150 --> 00:47:17.430
access to this borderline
infinity of people.

00:47:17.430 --> 00:47:21.050
And they're not as narrowly
popular as Snapchat.

00:47:21.050 --> 00:47:23.350
And you just never want
to be in the in-between.

00:47:23.350 --> 00:47:25.880
And that's really
their challenge.

00:47:25.880 --> 00:47:30.950
And I think there were
times in the past where

00:47:30.950 --> 00:47:33.460
Twitter, I think, was an
interesting acquisition.

00:47:33.460 --> 00:47:37.010
And it's interesting that
those times seem to be gone.

00:47:37.010 --> 00:47:42.590
I think there was a time
where Twitter's information

00:47:42.590 --> 00:47:45.300
graft, to me, seemed very
interesting to Google,

00:47:45.300 --> 00:47:45.800
actually.

00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:46.990
But you guys clearly--

00:47:46.990 --> 00:47:48.830
I have no idea whether you
ever looked at it seriously.

00:47:48.830 --> 00:47:50.390
But you guys clearly
passed on it.

00:47:50.390 --> 00:47:52.430
And I don't get a
whiff of interest

00:47:52.430 --> 00:47:53.775
from you about that acquisition.

00:47:53.775 --> 00:47:56.150
Now maybe you're just waiting
until it's bargain basement

00:47:56.150 --> 00:47:58.820
deal.

00:47:58.820 --> 00:48:01.070
There was a time when
Facebook felt very threatened

00:48:01.070 --> 00:48:03.920
by Twitter, especially by
the very "everything is open"

00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:05.120
model.

00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:06.860
And that was the
moment when you saw

00:48:06.860 --> 00:48:11.510
Mark tweak the privacy knobs
quite a bit on Facebook.

00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:13.340
That's when Mark
introduced asynchronous

00:48:13.340 --> 00:48:15.200
following on Facebook.

00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:19.010
But it was very easy for them
to just on-board those features

00:48:19.010 --> 00:48:19.790
into Facebook.

00:48:19.790 --> 00:48:22.670
And it obviated the need to
be worried about Twitter.

00:48:22.670 --> 00:48:25.920
So it just seems to me
that they're kind of beyond

00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:28.880
a pick-up, unless they fall
to a place where somebody just

00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:31.190
cannot prevent themselves
from buying them.

00:48:31.190 --> 00:48:33.530
These days, Verizon seems
to be in the business

00:48:33.530 --> 00:48:35.630
of a big giant
roll-up of everything

00:48:35.630 --> 00:48:37.120
not called Google and Facebook.

00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:38.607
So who the hell knows?

00:48:38.607 --> 00:48:40.510
AUDIENCE: So they never
crossed the chasm?

00:48:40.510 --> 00:48:42.676
MIKE HOEFFLINGER: Well, no,
if you look at the data,

00:48:42.676 --> 00:48:45.500
literally they did not,
which is exactly, actually,

00:48:45.500 --> 00:48:46.940
the math that I do in the book.

00:48:46.940 --> 00:48:50.270
And Snapchat is right in the
process of crossing the chasm.

00:48:50.270 --> 00:48:52.281
So Evan's got to really
stay concentrated.

00:48:52.281 --> 00:48:53.780
And of course, it
depends a bit also

00:48:53.780 --> 00:48:55.340
on how you define
target audience.

00:48:55.340 --> 00:48:58.130
If you define target audience
to young millennials and Gen Z,

00:48:58.130 --> 00:49:00.475
then Evan is crushing it.

00:49:00.475 --> 00:49:02.600
But Twitter, I think,
because it has the aspiration

00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:05.300
to broadly serve the internet,
if you look at the numbers,

00:49:05.300 --> 00:49:07.310
is exactly in
front of the chasm.

00:49:07.310 --> 00:49:10.700
They are one of the great
exact mathematical examples

00:49:10.700 --> 00:49:13.665
of what Moore is talking about.

00:49:13.665 --> 00:49:15.290
AUDIENCE: Do you have
any advice on how

00:49:15.290 --> 00:49:17.650
to navigate your career
in the Valley, broken down

00:49:17.650 --> 00:49:19.610
into your first 10 years,
your second 10 years?

00:49:19.610 --> 00:49:22.777
And what are some of the warning
signs when you say, go run

00:49:22.777 --> 00:49:23.360
for the hills?

00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:25.190
And what are some
of the signposts

00:49:25.190 --> 00:49:29.350
for, all right, let me hop
into this as soon as I can?

00:49:29.350 --> 00:49:31.760
MIKE HOEFFLINGER: So my
favorite warning sign for myself

00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:37.820
is when I have a moment
during a day where

00:49:37.820 --> 00:49:40.070
I have a choice about what
I can do next, as opposed

00:49:40.070 --> 00:49:42.920
to 12 things that
absolutely have to happen

00:49:42.920 --> 00:49:46.110
and I don't really have
much individual choice--

00:49:46.110 --> 00:49:47.720
when in those
moments of choice I

00:49:47.720 --> 00:49:49.730
find myself increasingly
doing something

00:49:49.730 --> 00:49:52.190
that's not my core job--

00:49:52.190 --> 00:49:55.220
and you have to actually
step outside of yourself

00:49:55.220 --> 00:49:56.690
and observe yourself doing this.

00:49:56.690 --> 00:49:59.240
When you increasingly see
yourself doing something that's

00:49:59.240 --> 00:50:00.822
not your core job,
it's probably time

00:50:00.822 --> 00:50:02.030
to connect to something else.

00:50:02.030 --> 00:50:03.744
Now that might be
at your own company,

00:50:03.744 --> 00:50:06.410
because here's something I think
that's under-appreciated by big

00:50:06.410 --> 00:50:09.080
companies-- which clearly
Google and Facebook now are--

00:50:09.080 --> 00:50:11.630
which is just the sheer number
of variety of opportunities

00:50:11.630 --> 00:50:15.164
inside that company without
having to give up the equity

00:50:15.164 --> 00:50:15.830
and reputation--

00:50:15.830 --> 00:50:18.434
I don't mean equity stock,
but equity reputation

00:50:18.434 --> 00:50:19.850
that you've built
at that company.

00:50:19.850 --> 00:50:22.760
So when you detect yourself,
in those moments where

00:50:22.760 --> 00:50:25.144
you have choice, drifting
to something else,

00:50:25.144 --> 00:50:26.060
pay attention to that.

00:50:26.060 --> 00:50:29.270
That, to me, has always
been a pretty effective way

00:50:29.270 --> 00:50:31.360
to find yourself connected
to what you do best.

00:50:31.360 --> 00:50:33.110
And that simply is
going to be when you're

00:50:33.110 --> 00:50:33.980
going to be happiest,
you're going

00:50:33.980 --> 00:50:35.396
to be working
harder at it, you're

00:50:35.396 --> 00:50:37.976
going to produce better
results, you'll be known for it.

00:50:37.976 --> 00:50:39.350
For me personally--
you mentioned

00:50:39.350 --> 00:50:41.470
do I do 10 years,
10 years, 10 years.

00:50:41.470 --> 00:50:42.845
I personally don't
work that way,

00:50:42.845 --> 00:50:44.511
but that certainly
doesn't mean that you

00:50:44.511 --> 00:50:45.620
shouldn't work that way.

00:50:45.620 --> 00:50:47.210
I find Silicon
Valley, the situation,

00:50:47.210 --> 00:50:50.600
even at individual companies,
much less the Valley itself--

00:50:50.600 --> 00:50:54.290
there is so much opportunity
and constant forward progress

00:50:54.290 --> 00:50:55.940
that if you try to
estimate, I'm going

00:50:55.940 --> 00:50:58.814
to do this in three,
five, seven, 10, 20 years,

00:50:58.814 --> 00:51:00.980
that you'll actually lose
sight of the opportunities

00:51:00.980 --> 00:51:01.550
in front of you.

00:51:01.550 --> 00:51:03.633
So I have a tendency to
just run a very tight loop

00:51:03.633 --> 00:51:05.480
with my career, which
is, find something

00:51:05.480 --> 00:51:07.460
that is going to be
awesome at a place

00:51:07.460 --> 00:51:09.370
that you think is awesome.

00:51:09.370 --> 00:51:13.010
And this book isn't just about
how the hell does Zuck work.

00:51:13.010 --> 00:51:15.710
It's also about, how can I
use this for my own career?

00:51:15.710 --> 00:51:17.900
Think about what are you
seeing around the corner,

00:51:17.900 --> 00:51:21.050
in terms of your own career,
that nobody else is seeing?

00:51:21.050 --> 00:51:23.810
And then just kick as
much ass as you possibly

00:51:23.810 --> 00:51:25.790
can at that thing.

00:51:25.790 --> 00:51:27.380
And then look at
what opportunities

00:51:27.380 --> 00:51:29.200
that's created for
you, rinse, and repeat.

00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:32.750
And that's a tight loop that I
use for managing my own career.

00:51:32.750 --> 00:51:35.510
And then things happen.

00:51:35.510 --> 00:51:39.180
I find it's hard for me
to plan three, five, 10,

00:51:39.180 --> 00:51:39.819
20 years ahead.

00:51:39.819 --> 00:51:41.360
Or to, like, in my
my first 10 years,

00:51:41.360 --> 00:51:45.320
I need to do x so that in
my second 20, I can do y,

00:51:45.320 --> 00:51:47.870
because I find I do
my best work when

00:51:47.870 --> 00:51:51.229
I'm pretty stoked about
that thing that I've picked.

00:51:51.229 --> 00:51:53.270
And you can't just pick
something for two months.

00:51:53.270 --> 00:51:54.860
Nobody wants somebody that
does this for two months

00:51:54.860 --> 00:51:56.068
and then that for two months.

00:51:56.068 --> 00:51:59.810
Eventually, your resume
will just look like shit.

00:51:59.810 --> 00:52:02.480
So it's a very,
very personal thing.

00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:04.910
I hesitate to even give
advice on this topic,

00:52:04.910 --> 00:52:07.520
because so many people
do it different ways.

00:52:07.520 --> 00:52:11.360
AUDIENCE: So with
Facebook, do you ever

00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:15.250
see them coming out with their
own next big product in-house?

00:52:15.250 --> 00:52:17.660
Because you see something
like Masquerade pages.

00:52:17.660 --> 00:52:19.290
None of those things
really take off.

00:52:19.290 --> 00:52:21.581
Most of the things that
they've done, they've acquired.

00:52:21.581 --> 00:52:24.330
We've got WhatsApp,
Instagram, and Oculus--

00:52:24.330 --> 00:52:27.290
Oculus which is in the News
for all the wrong reasons

00:52:27.290 --> 00:52:28.592
right now.

00:52:28.592 --> 00:52:29.550
MIKE HOEFFLINGER: True.

00:52:29.550 --> 00:52:30.560
Absolutely true.

00:52:30.560 --> 00:52:32.570
Yeah, that is a
really great question.

00:52:32.570 --> 00:52:35.120
And I address it
specifically in the book.

00:52:35.120 --> 00:52:36.890
In the book, I have
a whole chapter

00:52:36.890 --> 00:52:38.900
that I call "Failure
Isn't," which is just

00:52:38.900 --> 00:52:41.716
kind of the standard
treatise on,

00:52:41.716 --> 00:52:43.340
you've got to
institutionalize failure.

00:52:43.340 --> 00:52:44.715
If you're not
trying enough shit,

00:52:44.715 --> 00:52:47.020
not enough good things
will come out of it.

00:52:47.020 --> 00:52:49.520
But then the chapter right after
that is when does all this,

00:52:49.520 --> 00:52:54.320
quote unquote, "failure"
turn into just failure, which

00:52:54.320 --> 00:52:55.550
is what you're talking about.

00:52:55.550 --> 00:52:57.420
You kind of now look
at the track record.

00:52:57.420 --> 00:53:01.105
You would argue Messenger has
done extremely well, especially

00:53:01.105 --> 00:53:02.480
with the arrival
of David Marcus.

00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:04.460
That's obviously a
homegrown product.

00:53:04.460 --> 00:53:06.240
The thing that we don't
talk about as much

00:53:06.240 --> 00:53:07.781
that's also doing
very well homegrown

00:53:07.781 --> 00:53:11.150
is Groups, because
it is a separate app.

00:53:11.150 --> 00:53:13.790
You may not use it, but 600,
700 million people a month

00:53:13.790 --> 00:53:16.160
do use that app
very specifically.

00:53:16.160 --> 00:53:17.410
But you're totally right.

00:53:17.410 --> 00:53:20.890
The homegrown track record-- not
so good, especially after Zuck

00:53:20.890 --> 00:53:24.110
failed twice to
convince Evan to sell.

00:53:24.110 --> 00:53:25.820
He then failed
three times trying

00:53:25.820 --> 00:53:28.135
to build an app that's like it.

00:53:28.135 --> 00:53:29.510
I'll tell you
what's interesting,

00:53:29.510 --> 00:53:32.297
though, is starting five years
ago, he picked up Instagram.

00:53:32.297 --> 00:53:34.130
Then two years later,
he picked up WhatsApp,

00:53:34.130 --> 00:53:35.910
kind of on the back of
picking up Instagram.

00:53:35.910 --> 00:53:37.400
Then he picked up
David Marcus, who

00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:40.850
used to be the CEO of PayPal
who now works for Mark.

00:53:40.850 --> 00:53:43.830
So you can see Mark's pretty
effective at bringing people

00:53:43.830 --> 00:53:45.596
to Facebook.

00:53:45.596 --> 00:53:46.970
And so now all
the sudden, he has

00:53:46.970 --> 00:53:49.940
four tools to compete
against Snapchat with.

00:53:49.940 --> 00:53:53.150
And he's actually chosen
the best possible strategy.

00:53:53.150 --> 00:53:56.180
If you're fairly ego-less
and you're OK simply copying

00:53:56.180 --> 00:53:57.890
the other guy,
then he has chosen

00:53:57.890 --> 00:54:00.370
a perfect strategy,
which is like,

00:54:00.370 --> 00:54:02.780
congratulations, Evan,
for inventing stories,

00:54:02.780 --> 00:54:05.765
I will now build this into
all four of my products,

00:54:05.765 --> 00:54:07.780
so we'll see you
on the other side.

00:54:07.780 --> 00:54:11.380
And then I'm sorry, then
I'll build an API for camera.

00:54:11.380 --> 00:54:16.180
So at some point,
you've got to worry.

00:54:16.180 --> 00:54:18.350
Here, to me, is actually
a bigger concern,

00:54:18.350 --> 00:54:23.150
which is business at Facebook
going really well, profitable.

00:54:23.150 --> 00:54:25.820
He's able to engage in a
bunch of additional things,

00:54:25.820 --> 00:54:28.020
like picking up Oculus,
trying to pursue

00:54:28.020 --> 00:54:32.310
connecting the unconnected--
all of those kind of things.

00:54:32.310 --> 00:54:34.010
And there comes a
point in time where

00:54:34.010 --> 00:54:37.430
you're doing too many things.

00:54:37.430 --> 00:54:39.570
And suddenly, you have
too many failures.

00:54:39.570 --> 00:54:41.760
And you lose track of
how many of these things

00:54:41.760 --> 00:54:43.210
actually lead to anything.

00:54:43.210 --> 00:54:45.210
You become deeply distracted.

00:54:45.210 --> 00:54:47.490
And he's not there yet.

00:54:47.490 --> 00:54:49.560
But that's something that
he'll have to monitor.

00:54:49.560 --> 00:54:52.057
And that's never
happened to him.

00:54:52.057 --> 00:54:54.390
It'll be the first time that
he'll have to deal with the

00:54:54.390 --> 00:54:57.570
"when is too many
things, too many things?"

00:54:57.570 --> 00:55:00.660
And he's always been
incredibly good at dealing

00:55:00.660 --> 00:55:02.760
with the first time
stuff happens to him.

00:55:02.760 --> 00:55:04.920
He's one of the
all-time greats at that.

00:55:04.920 --> 00:55:06.150
But we'll have to see.

00:55:06.150 --> 00:55:07.200
Notice, by the way--

00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:09.116
you're totally right
about Oculus, by the way.

00:55:09.116 --> 00:55:11.900
That has not gone well
for a bunch of reasons.

00:55:11.900 --> 00:55:16.500
And turns out, his execs were--

00:55:16.500 --> 00:55:18.920
yikes.

00:55:18.920 --> 00:55:21.240
But notice what
he's done to fix it.

00:55:21.240 --> 00:55:24.820
And I'm going bring this
back to a Google story.

00:55:24.820 --> 00:55:29.010
He went and got
himself Hugo Barra.

00:55:29.010 --> 00:55:32.360
Don't underestimate
that shit for a second,

00:55:32.360 --> 00:55:33.735
because Hugo was your guy.

00:55:33.735 --> 00:55:34.860
And then he went to Xiaomi.

00:55:34.860 --> 00:55:36.530
He was huge there.

00:55:36.530 --> 00:55:40.110
And now Mark's like,
this Oculus thing--

00:55:40.110 --> 00:55:42.190
not going so well, change
the management team.

00:55:42.190 --> 00:55:44.300
Hugo, please come
in, run AR/VR for us.

00:55:44.300 --> 00:55:46.560
And it's amazing, by
the way, how often--

00:55:46.560 --> 00:55:47.860
all the time, he says it 100%.

00:55:47.860 --> 00:55:50.400
Whenever Zuck is talking about
Oculus, he's always AR/VR.

00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:54.300
So this has nothing to do with
giant-ass ski goggles connected

00:55:54.300 --> 00:55:55.140
to PCs.

00:55:55.140 --> 00:55:57.840
He is clearly working on this.

00:55:57.840 --> 00:56:00.120
And he got himself
Hugo to go do it.

00:56:00.120 --> 00:56:03.330
So even though he picked up
Oculus and it didn't work--

00:56:03.330 --> 00:56:05.020
which you could
argue was a failure--

00:56:05.020 --> 00:56:07.020
he's an interesting
enough place for Hugo

00:56:07.020 --> 00:56:08.820
to go to to go fix this thing.

00:56:08.820 --> 00:56:11.280
So even his failures are
kind of turning out OK,

00:56:11.280 --> 00:56:12.990
because he's got safety nets.

00:56:12.990 --> 00:56:15.240
But we'll have to see what
happens the first time he's

00:56:15.240 --> 00:56:18.302
really facing a major crisis.

00:56:18.302 --> 00:56:20.010
SPEAKER: Mike, thanks
so much for coming.

00:56:20.010 --> 00:56:20.760
Great to see you again, man.

00:56:20.760 --> 00:56:21.165
Thanks for coming in.

00:56:21.165 --> 00:56:22.728
MIKE HOEFFLINGER: Thank
you so much for having me.

00:56:22.728 --> 00:56:23.686
I really appreciate it.

00:56:23.686 --> 00:56:25.590
[APPLAUSE]

00:56:25.590 --> 00:56:28.070
SPEAKER: Thanks, everybody.
