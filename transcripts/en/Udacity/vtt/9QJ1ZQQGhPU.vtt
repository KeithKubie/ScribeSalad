00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
In our solution, we always compute the

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
t and x and v value at the beginning of the next step,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and you make use of the fact that the entry number

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
0 of t and the entry number 0 of x and the entry number 0 of v

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
are already equal to 0, which is what we want.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
If you run the program, you see that per second,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
the velocity decreases by 10 m/s.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
It starts out at 0 and keeps decreasing,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
which means the speed, the magnitude

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
of the velocity keeps increasing.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
This falling object gets faster and faster,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
but in a negative direction, which is our x coordinate

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
starts at 0 as intended.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
It decreases slowly

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and then faster and faster.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
You see gravitational acceleration in action.
