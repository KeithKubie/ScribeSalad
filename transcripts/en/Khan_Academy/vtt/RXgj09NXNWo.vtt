00:00:00.727 --> 00:00:02.584
Voiceover:Below are the
steps that Steven used

00:00:02.584 --> 00:00:06.248
to correctly solve the
equation six X is equal to

00:00:06.248 --> 00:00:09.926
three times X plus four, four X.

00:00:09.926 --> 00:00:11.990
Step one is missing.

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:15.131
What could Steven have
written for step one?

00:00:15.131 --> 00:00:17.643
So let's see, so this is
the original equation,

00:00:17.643 --> 00:00:19.643
they give us a blank for step one,

00:00:19.643 --> 00:00:22.075
and then we see that he eventually
gets to three X equals 12.

00:00:22.075 --> 00:00:24.316
That he divides both sides by three

00:00:24.316 --> 00:00:25.804
and he gets to X equals four.

00:00:25.804 --> 00:00:28.742
So the best way I could
think about doing this

00:00:28.742 --> 00:00:30.500
is to think, what would I do?

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:31.845
Well if I saw something like this,

00:00:31.845 --> 00:00:34.948
my extinct would be to
distribute this three

00:00:34.948 --> 00:00:39.265
so that I could start separating the parts

00:00:39.265 --> 00:00:40.545
of this expression that have a variable,

00:00:40.545 --> 00:00:42.816
that have the X, and the
parts that are constant.

00:00:42.816 --> 00:00:46.113
So let's try to distribute
this three and see what we get.

00:00:46.113 --> 00:00:48.272
and see if that's a reasonable step for

00:00:48.272 --> 00:00:50.416
the direction that Steven went in.

00:00:50.416 --> 00:00:53.360
So if we do that, we'd
get six X is equal to,

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:54.736
we haven't changed the left-hand side,

00:00:54.736 --> 00:00:58.188
and the right-hand side
three times X is three X.

00:00:58.188 --> 00:01:01.502
Then three times four is 12.

00:01:01.502 --> 00:01:05.291
So you get six X is
equal to three X plus 12.

00:01:05.291 --> 00:01:08.098
Now if I don't even look
at what Steven's doing

00:01:08.098 --> 00:01:10.866
right over here, if I'm
trying to solve for X,

00:01:10.866 --> 00:01:12.529
what would be the next
thing that I would do?

00:01:12.529 --> 00:01:15.505
Well, I'd try to isolate
all of the X's on one side,

00:01:15.505 --> 00:01:18.202
and if I want all the
X's on the left-hand side

00:01:18.202 --> 00:01:21.618
I would subtract three X from both sides.

00:01:21.618 --> 00:01:28.599
So if you subtract three X from both sides

00:01:28.661 --> 00:01:32.280
you would then get Steven's
second step right over here.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.735
So this looks like a completely

00:01:35.735 --> 00:01:38.237
reasonable first step for Steven.

00:01:38.237 --> 00:01:40.589
The first step is he distributes the three

00:01:40.589 --> 00:01:43.773
to get this expression,
then he subtracts three X

00:01:43.773 --> 00:01:46.830
from both sides to get
three X is equal to 12,

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.646
and then he divides both sides by three

00:01:49.646 --> 00:01:52.384
to get X is equal to four.
