[music plays throughout]

00:00:01.904 --> 00:00:04.543
The Wyss Institute
has developed an innovative approach

00:00:04.565 --> 00:00:06.095
to fighting cancer.

00:00:06.497 --> 00:00:09.580
This approach was developed
in collaboration with biologists,

00:00:09.602 --> 00:00:11.370
clinicians, and researchers

00:00:11.392 --> 00:00:13.222
at the Dana-Farber
Cancer Institute

00:00:13.244 --> 00:00:15.857
in Harvard School of Engineering
and Applied Sciences. 

00:00:16.308 --> 00:00:17.824
Cancer is able to grow

00:00:17.846 --> 00:00:20.077
because tumors are made
of the patient's own cells 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:22.857
which the immune system
does not recognize as a threat.

00:00:23.298 --> 00:00:25.182
The Wyss cancer vaccine technology

00:00:25.204 --> 00:00:28.329
reprogrammed the immune system
to reject these tumor cells. 

00:00:29.128 --> 00:00:31.355
The vaccine 
is a spongy porous matrix, 

00:00:31.377 --> 00:00:33.868
approximately the size
of a standard aspirin tablet, 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.299
and is implanted directly under the skin
near a lymph node. 

00:00:38.737 --> 00:00:41.385
The vaccine is designed
to quickly release the protein 

00:00:41.407 --> 00:00:44.648
granulocyte-macrophage
colony-stimulating factor

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.507
into the surrounding tissue,
which attracts dendritic cells â€“

00:00:47.529 --> 00:00:50.375
a specific type of immune cell â€“
into the vaccine. 

00:00:50.397 --> 00:00:52.365
These immune cells
are then re-programmed 

00:00:52.387 --> 00:00:53.908
with fragments 
of the tumor cells,

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.198
along with a signal 
mimicking an infection.

00:00:58.057 --> 00:01:01.249
These activated immune cells
then hone to the nearest lymph node, 

00:01:01.271 --> 00:01:03.381
where they train other cells
of the immune system 

00:01:03.403 --> 00:01:05.724
to recognize the tumor cells
as something dangerous

00:01:05.746 --> 00:01:07.357
that should be destroyed.

00:01:07.926 --> 00:01:10.680
Specifically in the lymph node,
the activated dendritic cells 

00:01:10.702 --> 00:01:14.151
present tumor cell fragments
to certain T-cells of the immune system. 

00:01:15.615 --> 00:01:17.815
These trained T-cells
then proliferate. 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.380
These cytotoxic T-cells
circulate throughout the body 

00:01:26.402 --> 00:01:28.484
looking for any
of these same tumor cells 

00:01:28.506 --> 00:01:30.091
to attack and destroy.

00:01:30.113 --> 00:01:32.904
The vaccination 
not only could destroy tumor cells, 

00:01:32.926 --> 00:01:34.949
but it could also create 
immune memory, 

00:01:34.971 --> 00:01:36.842
which could provide
a long-term protection

00:01:36.864 --> 00:01:38.397
against tumor reoccurence.

00:01:38.441 --> 00:01:42.324
The vaccine safely degrades over time
and is then excreted by the body. 

00:01:42.346 --> 00:01:43.924
With this new technology,

00:01:43.946 --> 00:01:46.836
we can potentially revolutionize
cancer care. 

00:01:46.858 --> 00:01:48.535
