00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:19.490
really like about this book and and
 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:21.490
really like about this book and and
reasons that you should read it and

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:21.500
reasons that you should read it and
 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.159
reasons that you should read it and
reasons why you shouldn't be afraid that

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:24.169
reasons why you shouldn't be afraid that
 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:27.430
reasons why you shouldn't be afraid that
there are equations in it well they're

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.440
there are equations in it well they're
 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.529
there are equations in it well they're
not really because there's narratives he

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:29.539
not really because there's narratives he
 

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:31.000
not really because there's narratives he
had their little boxes and then they're

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.010
had their little boxes and then they're
 

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:32.439
had their little boxes and then they're
in room balls right and then there are

00:05:32.439 --> 00:05:32.449
in room balls right and then there are
 

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:34.300
in room balls right and then there are
narratives that really explain to you

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:34.310
narratives that really explain to you
 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:36.939
narratives that really explain to you
and actually it's like they really do go

00:05:36.939 --> 00:05:36.949
and actually it's like they really do go
 

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:38.710
and actually it's like they really do go
a long way in saying these economic

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:38.720
a long way in saying these economic
 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.290
a long way in saying these economic
historian to just use equations that the

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:41.300
historian to just use equations that the
 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:43.120
historian to just use equations that the
emperor has no clothes because it really

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:43.130

understanding of the world so so first
of all I want to say that in doing so a

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:51.820
of all I want to say that in doing so a
 

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:55.510
of all I want to say that in doing so a
lot of Scott a lot of scholars focus on

lot of Scott a lot of scholars focus on
 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.719
lot of Scott a lot of scholars focus on
the impact of institutions both in the

the impact of institutions both in the
 

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:00.580
the impact of institutions both in the
way they'd been defined them and also in

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:00.590
way they'd been defined them and also in
 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:02.080
way they'd been defined them and also in
the way that I think people more

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:02.090
the way that I think people more
 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:04.270

impact of institutions on development

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:10.520
impact of institutions on development
 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.510
impact of institutions on development
and one of the things that I really love

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:13.520
and one of the things that I really love
 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.460
and one of the things that I really love
about this book it's something that I I

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:15.470
about this book it's something that I I
 

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:18.790
about this book it's something that I I
think a lot of what I do is based on and

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:18.800
think a lot of what I do is based on and
 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.680
think a lot of what I do is based on and
and that I urge all of you to keep

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:20.690
and that I urge all of you to keep
 

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:24.100
and that I urge all of you to keep
really in your minds is this notion that

really in your minds is this notion that
different institutions can play similar

needs to be investigated and I think

00:06:48.709 --> 00:06:48.719
needs to be investigated and I think
 

00:06:48.719 --> 00:06:50.119
needs to be investigated and I think
that's one of the most important

00:06:50.119 --> 00:06:50.129
that's one of the most important
 

00:06:50.129 --> 00:06:51.950
that's one of the most important
implications of the book and also of a

lot of the of the models that you that

lot of the of the models that you that

which these models are designed and and
been talked about the model that I was

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:43.620
been talked about the model that I was
 

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:45.589
been talked about the model that I was
going to talk about that is the model

00:07:45.589 --> 00:07:45.599
going to talk about that is the model

mechanisms in it credit transactions and

mechanisms in it credit transactions and
trade relations so I don't have to talk

trade relations so I don't have to talk
 

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:02.749
trade relations so I don't have to talk
about that and that saves a little bit

00:08:02.749 --> 00:08:02.759
about that and that saves a little bit
 

00:08:02.759 --> 00:08:07.369

if that is true and may be true I think
 

00:45:16.870 --> 00:45:19.020
if that is true and may be true I think
we need a fuller story that is really

hardest question of all why it seemed

00:45:36.990 --> 00:45:37.000
hardest question of all why it seemed
 

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:38.570
hardest question of all why it seemed
like a good idea

00:45:38.570 --> 00:45:38.580

00:53:26.200 --> 00:53:26.210
warfare it seems to me whether we start
 

00:53:26.210 --> 00:53:27.880
warfare it seems to me whether we start
the 30 years world where we where we

00:53:27.880 --> 00:53:27.890
the 30 years world where we where we
 

00:53:27.890 --> 00:53:30.100
the 30 years world where we where we
march it through it seems that it's it's

00:53:30.100 --> 00:53:30.110
march it through it seems that it's it's
 

00:53:30.110 --> 00:53:33.190
march it through it seems that it's it's
more it is a larger scale and greater

00:53:33.190 --> 00:53:33.200
more it is a larger scale and greater
 

00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:35.620
more it is a larger scale and greater
duration in terms of threat in Europe

00:53:35.620 --> 00:53:35.630
duration in terms of threat in Europe
 

00:53:35.630 --> 00:53:38.710
duration in terms of threat in Europe
than it is in China so in a sense our

00:53:38.710 --> 00:53:38.720
than it is in China so in a sense our
 

00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:42.610
than it is in China so in a sense our
argument is is a contrast it's a

00:53:42.610 --> 00:53:42.620
argument is is a contrast it's a
 

00:53:42.620 --> 00:53:44.230
argument is is a contrast it's a
relative statement it's not an absolute

00:53:44.230 --> 00:53:44.240
relative statement it's not an absolute
 

00:53:44.240 --> 00:53:46.660
relative statement it's not an absolute
statement and it's to isolate the fact

00:53:46.660 --> 00:53:46.670
statement and it's to isolate the fact
 

00:53:46.670 --> 00:53:48.490
statement and it's to isolate the fact
that on average the people who are going

00:53:48.490 --> 00:53:48.500
that on average the people who are going
 

00:53:48.500 --> 00:53:50.560
that on average the people who are going
to be engaging economic activities for

00:53:50.560 --> 00:53:50.570
to be engaging economic activities for
 

00:53:50.570 --> 00:53:53.170
to be engaging economic activities for
producing goods are not going to run

00:53:53.170 --> 00:53:53.180
producing goods are not going to run
 

00:53:53.180 --> 00:53:57.360
producing goods are not going to run
behind city walls in the mansion period

00:53:57.360 --> 00:53:57.370
behind city walls in the mansion period
 

00:53:57.370 --> 00:53:59.190
behind city walls in the mansion period
because of the threat of war the threat

00:53:59.190 --> 00:53:59.200
because of the threat of war the threat
 

00:53:59.200 --> 00:54:02.880
because of the threat of war the threat
of war was typically on peripheries or

00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:02.890
of war was typically on peripheries or
 

00:54:02.890 --> 00:54:05.910
of war was typically on peripheries or
frontiers and when it was more general

00:54:05.910 --> 00:54:05.920
frontiers and when it was more general
 

00:54:05.920 --> 00:54:07.590
frontiers and when it was more general
than that it was a more limited duration

00:54:07.590 --> 00:54:07.600
than that it was a more limited duration
 

00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:09.540
than that it was a more limited duration
than Europe so it's a relative argument

00:54:09.540 --> 00:54:09.550
than Europe so it's a relative argument
 

00:54:09.550 --> 00:54:11.520
than Europe so it's a relative argument
it's not an absolute the China didn't

00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:11.530
it's not an absolute the China didn't
 

00:54:11.530 --> 00:54:12.870
it's not an absolute the China didn't
have a military ball it's a relic

00:54:12.870 --> 00:54:12.880
have a military ball it's a relic
 

00:54:12.880 --> 00:54:14.880
have a military ball it's a relic
argument in two senses where it's found

00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:14.890
argument in two senses where it's found
 

00:54:14.890 --> 00:54:18.210
argument in two senses where it's found
and and when it's fun and so I think you

00:54:18.210 --> 00:54:18.220
and and when it's fun and so I think you
 

00:54:18.220 --> 00:54:21.290
and and when it's fun and so I think you
know and I first certainly it is also

00:54:21.290 --> 00:54:21.300
know and I first certainly it is also
 

00:54:21.300 --> 00:54:23.850
know and I first certainly it is also
debatable the extent to which this

00:54:23.850 --> 00:54:23.860
debatable the extent to which this
 

00:54:23.860 --> 00:54:25.980
debatable the extent to which this
variable is that important but it is

00:54:25.980 --> 00:54:25.990
variable is that important but it is
 

00:54:25.990 --> 00:54:27.810
variable is that important but it is
something you can directly contrast

00:54:27.810 --> 00:54:27.820
something you can directly contrast
 

00:54:27.820 --> 00:54:29.760
something you can directly contrast
between the two cases and say there's a

00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:29.770
between the two cases and say there's a
 

00:54:29.770 --> 00:54:32.730
between the two cases and say there's a
difference in this and we think is

00:54:32.730 --> 00:54:32.740
difference in this and we think is
 

00:54:32.740 --> 00:54:34.050
difference in this and we think is
associated with another kind of

00:54:34.050 --> 00:54:34.060
associated with another kind of
 

00:54:34.060 --> 00:54:36.090
associated with another kind of
difference that's a causal mechanism so

00:54:36.090 --> 00:54:36.100
difference that's a causal mechanism so
 

00:54:36.100 --> 00:54:37.890
difference that's a causal mechanism so
many of these other things are instances

00:54:37.890 --> 00:54:37.900
many of these other things are instances
 

00:54:37.900 --> 00:54:40.320
many of these other things are instances
of well Europeans have this and

00:54:40.320 --> 00:54:40.330
of well Europeans have this and
 

00:54:40.330 --> 00:54:42.420
of well Europeans have this and
therefore they have other things well

00:54:42.420 --> 00:54:42.430
therefore they have other things well
 

00:54:42.430 --> 00:54:45.960
therefore they have other things well
for that how do we work through the

00:54:45.960 --> 00:54:45.970
for that how do we work through the
 

00:54:45.970 --> 00:54:47.400
for that how do we work through the
mechanism like that so here's an example

00:54:47.400 --> 00:54:47.410
mechanism like that so here's an example
 

00:54:47.410 --> 00:54:49.620
mechanism like that so here's an example
of and this is the challenge when we're

00:54:49.620 --> 00:54:49.630
of and this is the challenge when we're
 

00:54:49.630 --> 00:54:51.420
of and this is the challenge when we're
of getting symmetric kinds of

00:54:51.420 --> 00:54:51.430
of getting symmetric kinds of
 

00:54:51.430 --> 00:54:54.390
of getting symmetric kinds of
information first I mentioned Maxine's

00:54:54.390 --> 00:54:54.400
information first I mentioned Maxine's
 

00:54:54.400 --> 00:54:56.280
information first I mentioned Maxine's
Maxine Berg's work in the issue of

00:54:56.280 --> 00:54:56.290
Maxine Berg's work in the issue of
 

00:54:56.290 --> 00:54:59.760
Maxine Berg's work in the issue of
invention there's been a lot of work in

00:54:59.760 --> 00:54:59.770
invention there's been a lot of work in
 

00:54:59.770 --> 00:55:01.890
invention there's been a lot of work in
the last 15 years on Europeans

00:55:01.890 --> 00:55:01.900
the last 15 years on Europeans
 

00:55:01.900 --> 00:55:03.510
the last 15 years on Europeans
development of useful and reliable

00:55:03.510 --> 00:55:03.520
development of useful and reliable
 

00:55:03.520 --> 00:55:05.790
development of useful and reliable
knowledge that's the politically correct

00:55:05.790 --> 00:55:05.800
knowledge that's the politically correct
 

00:55:05.800 --> 00:55:07.650

way to talk about science and technology

00:55:07.650 --> 00:55:07.660
way to talk about science and technology
 

00:55:07.660 --> 00:55:11.040
way to talk about science and technology
in the early modern period and that's it

00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:11.050
in the early modern period and that's it
 

00:55:11.050 --> 00:55:12.600
in the early modern period and that's it
that's it and I think that's a youth bet

00:55:12.600 --> 00:55:12.610
that's it and I think that's a youth bet
 

00:55:12.610 --> 00:55:14.670
that's it and I think that's a youth bet
it's a good way to think of it and so

00:55:14.670 --> 00:55:14.680
it's a good way to think of it and so
 

00:55:14.680 --> 00:55:16.230
it's a good way to think of it and so
they asked what kinds of useful reliable

00:55:16.230 --> 00:55:16.240
they asked what kinds of useful reliable
 

00:55:16.240 --> 00:55:18.000
they asked what kinds of useful reliable
knowledge are is there another in other

00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:18.010
knowledge are is there another in other
 

00:55:18.010 --> 00:55:20.970
knowledge are is there another in other
parts of the world and the fact that we

00:55:20.970 --> 00:55:20.980
parts of the world and the fact that we
 

00:55:20.980 --> 00:55:23.250
parts of the world and the fact that we
know a lot about English and European

00:55:23.250 --> 00:55:23.260
know a lot about English and European
 

00:55:23.260 --> 00:55:27.210
know a lot about English and European
invention in general it doesn't tell us

00:55:27.210 --> 00:55:27.220

goes on in China the typical the

00:55:30.840 --> 00:55:30.850
goes on in China the typical the
 

00:55:30.850 --> 00:55:32.100
goes on in China the typical the
standard way this is going to say well

00:55:32.100 --> 00:55:32.110
standard way this is going to say well
 

00:55:32.110 --> 00:55:34.560
standard way this is going to say well
Chinese didn't have that and therefore

00:55:34.560 --> 00:55:34.570
Chinese didn't have that and therefore
 

00:55:34.570 --> 00:55:36.870
Chinese didn't have that and therefore
they couldn't have something else and

00:55:36.870 --> 00:55:36.880
they couldn't have something else and
 

00:55:36.880 --> 00:55:39.900
they couldn't have something else and
until we know what they were doing it's

00:55:39.900 --> 00:55:39.910
until we know what they were doing it's
 

00:55:39.910 --> 00:55:42.210
until we know what they were doing it's
hard to know the significance of the

hard to know the significance of the
 

00:55:42.220 --> 00:55:43.830
hard to know the significance of the
existence of evidence for which we have

no comparable data on the other
 

00:55:46.190 --> 00:55:48.610
no comparable data on the other
I mean that's in terms of technology

00:55:48.610 --> 00:55:48.620
I mean that's in terms of technology
 

00:55:48.620 --> 00:55:50.110
I mean that's in terms of technology
that really is the situation we're in

00:55:50.110 --> 00:55:50.120
that really is the situation we're in
 

00:55:50.120 --> 00:55:53.470
that really is the situation we're in
and that we feel there's an implicit and

00:55:53.470 --> 00:55:53.480
and that we feel there's an implicit and
 

00:55:53.480 --> 00:55:55.600
and that we feel there's an implicit and
large danger and inferring from the

large danger and inferring from the
 

00:55:55.610 --> 00:55:58.360

economic history we were taught 30 years
 

00:56:07.100 --> 00:56:09.100
economic history we were taught 30 years
ago that the Chinese didn't do things

thing that historians have brought to
 

00:56:31.940 --> 00:56:34.420

how knowledge circulated so it's very

00:56:38.920 --> 00:56:38.930
how knowledge circulated so it's very
 

00:56:38.930 --> 00:56:41.260
how knowledge circulated so it's very
hard to say how to measure the

scholarship as far as I can tell are
 

00:56:48.320 --> 00:56:50.560

quite uneven if we take and this is one

00:56:50.560 --> 00:56:50.570
