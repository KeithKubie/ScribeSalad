I'll be honest, when I was looking through the list of Disney animated films and I came across "Saludos Amigos," I'd never even heard of it.

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.100
I thought I knew most of the Disney hand-drawn films, but this one totally slipped my mind.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.900
And to be fair, there's kind of good reason.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:25.000
It's not very long--I don't even think it's really a full-length motion picture. I think it's about forty minutes.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.940
And on top of that, it's just sort of a weird premise.

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:35.120
A bunch of the Disney animators decide to fly to places like Brazil and Titicaca and so forth, to give them inspiration for their cartoons.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:41.880
And...that's it. It's literally just the animators going around, doing drawings, and showing you the cartoon they came up with.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.520
Does that really count as a movie?

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.460
I don't know; I can see that much more as a featurette or a making-of or a behind-the-scenes bit, but as a movie?

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.200
It's not very interesting.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.840
Maybe if we got to know the animators a little more, or if it was shot a little better...

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.600
But as is, it just sort of looks like someone's vacation videos, with just cartoons thrown in.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.540
The only cool thing about it is that you do get a little bit of culture.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:05.940
And that's always nice.

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.240
They show you what different words mean, they show you different parts of their land...

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.640
So at least you are getting a bit of an education out of it.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.000
But even the animation is just--they're normal cartoon animation.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.480
I love the cartoon animation, but to see an entire movie like that--oh heck, not even an entire movie, forty minutes--

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.460
heck, even the forty minutes isn't entirely animated...it seems like kind of a let-down.

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.000
I don't know; I'm not sure how to judge it, seeing how it's not even motion-picture length.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.300
But I often see it on the list of animated Disney films, so I guess I'll include it here.

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.540
And actually, this is the birthplace of that one green parrot.

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.780
I think most people think he came from "Three Caballeros," but nope, this is actually where he was born.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.520
I guess that's kinda neat.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:48.940
The only bit I remember really enjoying was when they were singing the song "Brazil," and you see this paintbrush go through and actually paint Brazil.

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.580
This is awesome Disney doing what awesome Disney does:

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.000
taking shapes and colors and playing with it.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.480
You think you're lookin' at a tree, but maybe you're lookin' at a bird.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.820
You think it's a bunch of bananas, but with a splash of black, you're lookin' at toucans.

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.040
Stuff like that is great, and if the rest of the film was like that, maybe I'd enjoy it more.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.280
But as is, it's pretty forgettable.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.360
It might be good to put on just as a time-waster for your kids, and like I said, it does have a little bit of culture in it.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.920
But as a movie, it's not that ground-breaking.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:20.240
If you just wanna say you've seen 'em all, go check it out, but aside from that, I'd say it's probably a decent one to skip.
