00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.860
We do almost everything online these days
because it’s more convenient: shopping,

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:06.480
banking and even dating, you do that.

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.440
So why don’t we vote online?

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.040
Hey DNews, Jackie here!

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.300
In 1999, then-President Bill Clinton asked
the National Science Foundation to look into

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.500
the viability of online ballots.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.330
And the committee found that internet voting
systems quote “pose significant risk" and

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.580
that quote “E-voting requires a much greater
level of security than e-commerce -- it's

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.170
not like buying a book over the Internet."

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.780
And now, 17 years later: it’s still just
not safe.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.460
No, your life isn’t in danger by voting
online but your vote is.

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.989
Because cyber security is still so fallible,
there’s no way to be certain that our elections

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:42.739
haven’t been tampered with if we vote online.

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:47.149
And even if we eventually figure out that
someone did mess with it, by that time it’ll

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:48.570
be too late for that election!

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.589
If you bank online and buy things online,
aren't those transactions safe?

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:53.940
Unfortunately, no.

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.749
Banks, credit card companies and online retailers
lose billions of dollars a year due to online

00:00:58.749 --> 00:01:02.769
fraud but you rarely hear about it because
if consumers believed that their data wasn’t

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:04.890
secure, the online market would collapse.

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.460
Instead, the company either absorbs the loss
itself or passes it down to you via fees and

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:10.990
maybe higher prices.

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.910
Fraud online often starts with pulling your
name, credit card info and other personal

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:15.910
information.

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:17.720
And one way they do this is with malware.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.940
One of the most famous recent cases comes
from the malware named Zeus.

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.950
The program is designed to wait until you
connect with your bank and then use those

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.210
credentials to transfer money out of your
account.

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.830
It doesn’t matter if you have a secure connection
because the malware is already inside the

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:30.830
computer.

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:36.570
In 2014, the FBI announced that it had disrupted
the GameOver Zeus botnet but not before $100

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.230
million was stolen from accounts around the
world.

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.830
If they can do that, it’s not hard to think
that hackers could do the same thing when

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:43.830
it comes to voting!

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.520
Malware could vote on your behalf or even
change your vote.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.930
McAfee, the security and antivirus company,
notes that financial or espionage motives

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.900
were involved in 89% of online security breaches.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.570
They believe that the hackers are usually
criminals who are looking either to profit

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.980
personally or on behalf of nationstates looking
for political leverage.

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.940
That is exactly what security experts fear
the most: an inability to truly control an

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.250
online voting system where elections could
be determined by someone other than the voters.

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.530
That being said, there is one country that
relies on online voting: Estonia!

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.970
They succeed by using a government ID, with
a chip, and associated PIN code AND a card

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.040
reader for your PC.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.850
Voters can track their vote with an app, and
parts of the software are available for public

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.200
inspection.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.450
Estonians can also vote as often as they want
but only their last vote will count.

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.420
This minimizes the chance that somebody forced
their vote.

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.770
Estonia believes their system hasn’t been
compromised, but security experts argue that

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:40.200
just because their system hasn’t been interfered
with yet, doesn’t mean that it can’t or

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.370
won’t be in the future.

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.720
Independent assessments of Estonia’s online
voting system, done in 2011 by the organization

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.319
Verified Voting, and in 2014 by researchers
at the University of Michigan, found that

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:55.260
voters’ privacy as well as the servers used
were vulnerable to attack from anyone or anywhere.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.350
The UMich report said there were quote “staggering
gaps in procedural and operational security,

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.209
and the architecture of the system leaves
it open to cyberattacks from foreign powers,

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:05.209
such as Russia.”

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.730
While the Estonian government disputes this,
it still makes a lot of people nervous.

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:14.819
But, why can't we just copy their system?
Estonia also uses a national ID card, something

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:15.940
the US doesn’t have.

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:21.410
Estonia has about 1 million eligible voters,
the US has over 225 million eligible voters.

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.560
And to be frank, elections in the U.S. are
more closely watched around the world… both

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.770
by citizens and hackers.

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:31.540
Security for a US election would obviously
be much more complicated to say the least.

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.790
On top of that, voting is supposed to be anonymous.

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.020
And right now we don’t have the technology
to track the integrity of anonymous ballots.

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:42.920
In the end, it seems like the system we have
now is the one that works best and appears

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:43.920
to be the most secure.

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.930
Here’s hoping we never have a repeat of
those hanging chads from 2000 -- if you don't

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.820
know what that is… oh my god.

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:51.160
It's about paper ballots.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.660
They would get stu--- you know what, just
Google it.

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.180
But does your vote actually matter?

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.200
Our sister network Seeker Daily tackles that
question right here.

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.950
What other questions about voting or the science
of voting can we break down for you?

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:04.690
Or are you just sick of the election?

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:13.060
Yay voting!
