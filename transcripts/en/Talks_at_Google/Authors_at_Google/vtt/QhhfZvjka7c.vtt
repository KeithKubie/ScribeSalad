00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.989
&gt;&gt;female presenter: Good afternoon, everyone.

00:00:01.989 --> 00:00:06.660
Authors at Google New York is very pleased
to welcome Joshua David and Robert Hammond,

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.090
who are neighbors of ours here in New York.

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:13.200
And they are responsible for the High Line.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:19.110
I mean, how much more do I have to say?

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:20.110
[applause]

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.850
&gt;&gt;Joshua David: Thank you all for joining
us today.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.070
I'm Josh.

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.130
That's Robert.

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.849
And we wrote a book that came out in October.

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:34.980
Oh, my shirt's undone.

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.050
And it's called "High Line: The--."

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.210
I forget the subtitle now.

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:39.870
It has a longer subtitle.

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.750
But it's about the High Line and it's on sale
in the back.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.430
And Google has very generously arranged to
have it be at a discount to all of you.

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:49.570
So, it's ten dollars.

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.739
It's a great buy.

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:55.789
And we've been wanting to come and talk to
you a little bit about it for a few months

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:57.539
now and the date kept moving around a little.

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.530
So, we're thrilled to be here.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:06.610
It's really an incredible journey that we've
been on and a lot of folks who work at Google

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:12.220
have been on with us as well over the past
12 years or so from when we started Friends

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:17.190
of the High Line to where we are now, where
we have nearly four million visitors a year

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:18.680
coming to the High Line.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:24.200
And so, it's hard to imagine when you go up
there now to imagine that once this was not

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.560
open to the public, was threatened with demolition,
was going to be torn down.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.890
It was a very different scenario just 12 years
ago.

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.840
And our book tells a little bit of that story.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:38.200
So you know this well, but this is the map
of where the High Line runs along the West

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.530
Side of Manhattan.

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.400
These were the conditions that led to the
construction of the High Line.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.270
Trains started running down the West Side
in the 1860s.

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.630
And immediately, people were getting killed
by the intersection of train traffic and other

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.040
kinds of vehicles--horse-drawn carts, cars,
and pedestrians.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.460
And the avenues became known as Death Avenue
because of these collisions.

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:07.320
And because of that, the City of New York
required that a man on horseback had to ride

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.320
in front of each train.

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.670
They were called the West Side Cowboys.

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.010
And this is one of them.

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:13.360
This is the High Line under construction.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.120
It started construction in 1929 and went to
1934.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.610
And you can see another elevated structure
to the left in this image, which was the old

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:22.690
Miller elevated highway.

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.770
There used to be an elevated highway along
the West Side that was built around the same

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:27.770
time.

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:28.770
More construction shots.

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:35.000
And this is the High Line when it was completed
in 1934 and trains started running on it.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.090
And one of the interesting things about the
way that it was built and the way that it

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.730
was used was trains actually were supposed
to go through buildings.

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.920
They loaded and unloaded directly into warehouses
and factories.

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.290
And that was an efficiency system.

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.500
And it's one of the things that makes the
High Line such an interesting part of the

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.540
built environment today.

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.680
This is the way that I first saw the High
Line from the ground and Robert as well.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.040
I live in Chelsea.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.080
Robert lives in the Village.

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.230
We didn't know each other.

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.710
Became interested in this odd relic that ran
through our neighborhoods.

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:14.390
But never really saw it from up above, only
saw it from the bottom.

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.390
And thought, "Wow.

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.300
That's an interesting structure and maybe
something interesting could be done with it."

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:24.110
This is the landscape that grew up on top
of it after the trains stopped running.

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:30.060
This was a photograph that was taken by photographer
named Joel Sternfeld in around 2000.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.790
But we didn't even see this when we started
Friends of the High Line.

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.010
We just saw it from the street and thought
it was something amazing.

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.660
We happened to meet at a community board meeting
in 1999.

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:46.080
We were both the only two people there who
thought that something should happen to the

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.680
High Line other than it being torn down.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.910
Everybody was there was in favor of demolishing
it.

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.500
But we thought this runs for 22 blocks, through
three different neighborhoods.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:02.020
Here's an amazing opportunity to create a
new way of seeing the city.

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:05.180
&gt;&gt;Robert Hammond: So, Josh was a travel writer
before this.

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.760
And my background was in little bit internet
start-ups.

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.830
And so, people think, "Oh."

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.349
Someone asks, "Can we see your business plan
for how you were thinking about starting the

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:15.370
High Line?"

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.049
And we really had no plan.

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:19.049
We had no money.

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.650
And we really had no relevant experience.

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.480
People assume we're architects or designers.

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:29.520
And in some ways, that's one of the keys to
the success of the High Line was not having

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:30.560
a plan.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.090
[laughs] And not having any experience because
we really--.

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:37.860
And it's great 'cause now Josh and I get all
this credit for doing this.

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.380
But the most important thing we did was really
just raise the flag and allowed other people

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:47.120
to come along to help us that did have the
experience and that did have the money.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.600
And that helped us coalesce around a plan.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.410
We also had a lot of opposition.

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:59.710
And now, the High Line is generally pretty
popular, but at the time, everyone really

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:00.870
wanted to tear it down.

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.570
The developers in the neighborhood wanted
to tear it down.

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:08.910
People in the community, some of them it was
a reminder they lived in a bad neighborhood

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.520
in the past because the trains used to run
through it.

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.530
But this guy was our main opponent--Giuliani.

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:19.290
And but it turned out it actually started
working in our favor because if people weren't

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:24.850
interested in the history or the pretty pictures,
the wildflowers, we could say, "Well, Giuliani

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:25.990
hates it and wants to--."

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.990
[laughter]

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:29.370
And they'd be like, "Oh, well then it must
be a great idea."

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:30.370
[laughter]

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:31.370
"I would love to help you."

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:36.180
The other thing that we really concentrated
on early on was design.

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.130
So, one of the very first things we did was
get a logo.

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:42.240
And it's still on our business card.

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.360
And it's now the logo of the park.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:47.550
And it was designed by a woman named Paula
Scher from Pentagram.

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:50.790
And the goal was one, to make us look like--.

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:55.330
This is what someone, one of our critics used
to say is this project's just two guys and

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:57.210
a logo.

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:58.820
Which we thought was a compliment.

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:05.520
But it made us feel like we were more than
just two guys working out of their apartments.

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:10.500
And so, it was also a commitment to design,
that we weren't just, if we were successful,

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:15.460
we weren't just gonna throw up a stair and
a planter and call it a day.

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:16.630
We were actually gonna--.

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:22.340
Good design was gonna follow all the through
if we ever wanted to build something up there.

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:27.570
So, going back to this Joel Sternfeld photo,
because this was also one of the keys to the

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:29.370
success was these photos.

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:33.650
So, this photographer, Joel Sternfeld, went
up there and he took pictures for us for one

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:36.660
year, between 2000 and 2001.

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:39.030
And we published it in a book called "Walking
the High Line."

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:42.370
And there's some of the photos in our book.

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:44.790
But you just see it in all different seasons.

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:51.420
And this is really what people feel in love
with, especially this picture was the key

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:52.490
to the success.

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:57.920
We realized we could just talk less and show
this photo more and often.

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:03.270
And this is what helped people just imagine
their own dreams of what could be done with

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:05.290
the High Line.

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:06.290
This is--.

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:08.130
I don't know how many of y’all remember
the restaurant Florent.

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:10.470
It used to be on Gansevoort.

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:11.470
This is Florent.

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:12.470
It was like a French bistro.

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:14.460
It was one of the first things in this neighborhood.

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:16.320
It was open 24 hours.

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:18.010
People would go after going to clubs.

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:22.810
And every Bastille Day, Florent would dress
up as Marie Antoinette.

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:27.360
And this year, he did the Marie Antoinette
as the High Line with the train going around

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:31.620
the bustle and the hat.

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:32.620
&gt;&gt;male #1: [inaudible ]

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:33.620
&gt;&gt;Robert Hammond: I know.

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:34.620
I know.

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:35.620
It's sad now.

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:38.040
But I think he's happier now that he doesn't
have the restaurant.

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:41.520
So, but the reason I put this slide up there
is also--.

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:42.580
Well, I'll go to the next slides.

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:43.580
It's more exciting.

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:44.590
We thought we'd--.

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:50.000
A semi-nude photo and if you're getting a
little sleepy at lunch, it could liven things

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.830
up.

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:56.600
Because one of the early keys to the success
was the gay community.

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:58.300
Josh and I are both gay.

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:01.870
And those were a lot of the people that lived
in the neighborhood.

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:03.060
Those were just our friends.

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:05.640
And so, they really coalesced around this
project.

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:11.930
And this is a talk we gave at the center a
while ago about the role, not just of the

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:15.880
gay community that helped us, but the role
that the gay community has played in preservation

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:18.949
projects all over the city and the world.

00:08:18.949 --> 00:08:20.810
&gt;&gt;Joshua David: Still going?

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:22.199
&gt;&gt;Robert Hammond: Yup.

00:08:22.199 --> 00:08:23.860
So, Mayer Bloomberg came in office.

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:28.320
He was more supportive than Giuliani, but
9/11 had happened.

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:30.640
We were in an economic crisis.

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:35.579
He didn't care about the pictures of Joel
Sternfeld's wildflowers and he didn't care

00:08:35.579 --> 00:08:38.129
about the naked guy on the High Line really.

00:08:38.129 --> 00:08:41.119
He cared more if it made economic sense.

00:08:41.119 --> 00:08:46.079
So, we commissioned an economic feasibility
study by a guy named John Alschuler at a firm

00:08:46.079 --> 00:08:50.240
called HR and A, to prove that it made economic
sense.

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:51.491
So, we looked--.

00:08:51.491 --> 00:08:56.319
The best example of a park really creating
value is Central Park.

00:08:56.319 --> 00:08:57.319
We said, "OK.

00:08:57.319 --> 00:09:00.699
Central Park's too big, too popular.

00:09:00.699 --> 00:09:02.579
Let's look at parks no one's ever heard of."

00:09:02.579 --> 00:09:06.720
That means some of y’all might 'cause it's
around the neighborhood like the Christopher

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:08.800
Park, Duane Park.

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:14.769
And the buildings around those parks are more
valuable to anywhere from six to thirteen

00:09:14.769 --> 00:09:16.519
percent.

00:09:16.519 --> 00:09:18.480
We also met with real estate marketers.

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:23.939
And they said the real way you create more
value is you create a district, a place people

00:09:23.939 --> 00:09:26.779
wanna work in, live in, visit, shop in.

00:09:26.779 --> 00:09:27.940
And so, we started--.

00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:33.300
We'd already started thinking about the High
Line as a connector of different things and

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:38.490
this is map that actually, the woman who did
our logo, drew of the neighborhood, Paula

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:39.490
Scher.

00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:41.399
And it just listed all the different things
happening.

00:09:41.399 --> 00:09:45.029
It was helping us show that this could connect
it all together.

00:09:45.029 --> 00:09:51.259
'Cause the West Village wasn't as popular
at the time.

00:09:51.259 --> 00:09:53.470
And so, the study showed--.

00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:54.809
We got the study actually wrong.

00:09:54.809 --> 00:09:55.809
This is the findings.

00:09:55.809 --> 00:09:57.959
We thought it would cost a hundred million
to build.

00:09:57.959 --> 00:10:00.670
So far, it's cost about 150 million.

00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:05.490
And we said over a 20-year time period, the
incremental tax benefits to the city would

00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:08.509
be about 250 million dollars.

00:10:08.509 --> 00:10:13.829
The city has recently revised those numbers
and it's coming in more like 900 million dollars.

00:10:13.829 --> 00:10:16.999
So, it turns out to have been a good investment.

00:10:16.999 --> 00:10:17.999
The city was actually--.

00:10:17.999 --> 00:10:21.389
We didn't really believe these numbers [laughs]
when we presented them.

00:10:21.389 --> 00:10:23.339
We were fluffing them up.

00:10:23.339 --> 00:10:24.339
&gt;&gt;Joshua David: Mmm.

00:10:24.339 --> 00:10:29.649
&gt;&gt;Robert Hammond: But the city believed enough
of them to go forward and really got behind

00:10:29.649 --> 00:10:32.310
the project.

00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:37.410
And so, but even in 2003, with the city behind
us, we just really, we still had no money.

00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:40.149
We had more of maybe a vague plan.

00:10:40.149 --> 00:10:44.129
And we still, the property owners that owned
property underneath were suing the city to

00:10:44.129 --> 00:10:45.250
tear it down.

00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:47.009
So, and no one knew what the High Line was.

00:10:47.009 --> 00:10:51.339
It's like, you asked people the thing and
you say, "Oh, the thing with pigeon shit when

00:10:51.339 --> 00:10:52.339
you go under it."

00:10:52.339 --> 00:10:53.769
And they go, "Oh, that thing.

00:10:53.769 --> 00:10:55.230
I hate that thing."

00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:58.249
But so, we did an ideas competition.

00:10:58.249 --> 00:11:02.360
And it was really just to create awareness
of the project and have people think about

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:03.360
it in different ways.

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:06.989
And this was one of our favorites for many
reasons.

00:11:06.989 --> 00:11:09.329
But it was a mile-long lap pool,--

00:11:09.329 --> 00:11:10.329
[laughter]

00:11:10.329 --> 00:11:14.759
which I still think would be an amazing idea.

00:11:14.759 --> 00:11:21.420
Some of the other concepts were more artistic,
like turning it into this icon.

00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:25.399
This was more of a political manifesto, where
you would imprison people in the I-beams of

00:11:25.399 --> 00:11:26.999
the High Line.

00:11:26.999 --> 00:11:30.149
And I don't know why they put a pool in there,
too, but--.

00:11:30.149 --> 00:11:35.500
This, I think, was playing off of "High,"
maybe--High Line.

00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:36.500
And then, this--.

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:37.980
This was actually looking at programming.

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:39.730
What would happen in and around the High Line?

00:11:39.730 --> 00:11:42.279
And this is what's really come true so much.

00:11:42.279 --> 00:11:45.829
It's not just what happens on the High Line,
but what happens in the neighborhood all around

00:11:45.829 --> 00:11:46.829
it.

00:11:46.829 --> 00:11:49.459
This was our favorite, was the mile-long roller
coaster.

00:11:49.459 --> 00:11:50.459
[laughter]

00:11:50.459 --> 00:11:54.230
And this possibly could have been better than
what we did 'cause you leave it all just as

00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:58.999
it was and then this urban scene, seeing people's
apartments and zoom down.

00:11:58.999 --> 00:12:04.381
And we had the exhibition at Grand Central
because the idea was to not make it just a

00:12:04.381 --> 00:12:10.120
local project, but to make it that this is
important for the whole city.

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:12.160
And we also--.

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:15.470
Josh and I didn't have a specific vision on
what we thought should go up there.

00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:19.579
And that was one of the advantages of not
being an architect.

00:12:19.579 --> 00:12:23.139
We said, "The city, the community, should
decide what was up there."

00:12:23.139 --> 00:12:25.259
So, we started doing a whole bunch of open
houses.

00:12:25.259 --> 00:12:30.689
And this is a postcard asking people what
you want, where we asked them, "What do you

00:12:30.689 --> 00:12:32.560
wanna see up there?"

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:37.310
Even before we really started designing, we've
now done about probably over, way over a dozen

00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:38.310
of these.

00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:40.850
We just had one about two weeks ago for the
new section.

00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:42.790
And you'll see some of the designs for that.

00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:43.790
And we're gonna have more.

00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:44.790
We'll have another one this summer.

00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:48.420
If you're interested, just sign up for an
email newsletter or Facebook.

00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:51.230
We're getting Google+.

00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:53.060
[laughter]

00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:55.559
And we partnered--.

00:12:55.559 --> 00:13:00.339
We've had to fight Giuliani, but then it was
really about partnering with government.

00:13:00.339 --> 00:13:01.750
And Bloomberg was very supportive.

00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:04.790
Christine Quinn, who's now the speaker of
the City Council, lives in the neighborhood,

00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:10.829
Hilary Clinton, Chuck Schumer, Jerry Nadler
all really got behind the project and it became

00:13:10.829 --> 00:13:12.300
really a public/private partnership.

00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:15.910
I love this photo 'cause none of them are
looking at each other.

00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:16.910
[laughter]

00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:20.069
They can all stand together, but not have
to acknowledge each other.

00:13:20.069 --> 00:13:24.619
So, when we got the political support, we
still needed to get the property owners on-board.

00:13:24.619 --> 00:13:29.239
So, we actually looked, again, at Grand Central.

00:13:29.239 --> 00:13:30.279
And everyone knows there are a lot of--.

00:13:30.279 --> 00:13:34.750
You might have heard the story of Jackie O.,
how she saved Grand Central from being demolished.

00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:39.610
But the other part of the story is one of
the ways they saved it was they allowed the

00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:44.259
owners, the railroad, to transfer development
rights anywhere in the neighborhood.

00:13:44.259 --> 00:13:47.720
It's also what saved the theaters and Times
Square in the 90s.

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:50.319
And so, we used the same mechanism.

00:13:50.319 --> 00:13:54.579
And it had only been used a few times in the
city, but it allowed the property owners to

00:13:54.579 --> 00:13:57.220
transfer development rights anywhere in the
neighborhood.

00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:01.430
Normally, you can only transfer to an adjacent
property owner and if they don't need your

00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:04.619
air rights or are already fully built-out,
you're out of luck.

00:14:04.619 --> 00:14:07.199
So, this really created a market for these
air rights.

00:14:07.199 --> 00:14:09.819
It helped us get the property owners on-board.

00:14:09.819 --> 00:14:17.709
&gt;&gt;Joshua David: So then, with that work done,
we set about actually designing the park that

00:14:17.709 --> 00:14:18.759
would be on the High Line.

00:14:18.759 --> 00:14:22.769
And it was a very different process than the
design ideas competition that Robert was showing

00:14:22.769 --> 00:14:24.809
you a little bit about before.

00:14:24.809 --> 00:14:27.389
Those design ideas, they could come from anyone.

00:14:27.389 --> 00:14:29.100
You didn't have to have any experience.

00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:30.579
You didn't have to be an architect.

00:14:30.579 --> 00:14:33.160
It didn't have to be financially rational.

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:34.999
It didn't have to be technically viable.

00:14:34.999 --> 00:14:39.040
We were just looking for interesting ideas
that would broaden the way that you thought

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:40.939
about the High Line in the first round.

00:14:40.939 --> 00:14:46.549
Now, what we were doing was looking for actual
teams of architects--multidisciplinary teams--that

00:14:46.549 --> 00:14:51.889
could actually create a design that would
make this amazing, but challenging environment

00:14:51.889 --> 00:14:53.600
open to the public.

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:57.930
And so, I think this picture really tells
the story of the challenge.

00:14:57.930 --> 00:14:59.839
We loved going up there when it was like this.

00:14:59.839 --> 00:15:05.499
And this is one of the many site visits we
did to better understand the site before we

00:15:05.499 --> 00:15:06.970
entered into design.

00:15:06.970 --> 00:15:12.339
But what would happen is if you went up with
a group like this--just a handful of people--by

00:15:12.339 --> 00:15:14.329
the end of the visit, it was all trampled
down.

00:15:14.329 --> 00:15:19.100
And this was an environment that we wanted
to open to the public, but the fact of opening

00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:21.110
it to the public would destroy it.

00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:26.360
So, the challenge that we gave to all of the
design teams that wanted to compete was how

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:33.859
do you create a landscape that's reflective
of this really amazing one that embodies the

00:15:33.859 --> 00:15:41.850
power of nature to overtake monumental, man-made
structure and really show the power of nature.

00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:47.709
And so, we had 51 design teams initially submit
applications.

00:15:47.709 --> 00:15:53.519
They were all made up of teams of architects,
landscape architects, security consultants,

00:15:53.519 --> 00:15:57.949
lighting consultants, historic preservation
consultants, signage people.

00:15:57.949 --> 00:16:01.290
And then, we went down to seven teams.

00:16:01.290 --> 00:16:05.660
And then, we went down to four teams in the
end that did the most detailed proposals.

00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:10.930
So, I'll just show a few images from some
of the different teams that submitted.

00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:16.309
This was a part of a proposal that was submitted
by Zaha Hadid's team.

00:16:16.309 --> 00:16:21.619
This is the southern end of the High Line
near Gansevoort Street, where the Whitney

00:16:21.619 --> 00:16:22.769
is now under construction.

00:16:22.769 --> 00:16:27.899
So, one of the things that all of the teams
picked up on was that something was gonna

00:16:27.899 --> 00:16:29.269
be built at that site.

00:16:29.269 --> 00:16:31.509
So, this was her proposal.

00:16:31.509 --> 00:16:32.509
It shows--.

00:16:32.509 --> 00:16:39.839
Her environment was very swooping, white forms,
not a lot of landscape.

00:16:39.839 --> 00:16:43.550
She did have an amazing landscape architect
on her team-- Diana Balmori.

00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:47.670
But landscape really wasn't the focus of this
proposal.

00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:53.799
And in one of the sessions where we were going
over it, it had an intermediate stage with

00:16:53.799 --> 00:16:54.799
the various teams.

00:16:54.799 --> 00:16:58.989
Robert asked Zaha, "Why aren't there any trees
in your proposal?"

00:16:58.989 --> 00:17:04.410
And she told Robert, "Trees are what architects
do when they don't know what to do with the

00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:05.410
space."

00:17:05.410 --> 00:17:06.410
[laughter]

00:17:06.410 --> 00:17:12.500
This is part of a proposal by Michael Van
Valkenburgh, was working with Julie Bargmann

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:14.270
on a team called Terragram.

00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:16.510
It was a great proposal in many ways.

00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:21.199
Some of the things that are in it are things
that are reflective of choices that we ultimately

00:17:21.199 --> 00:17:22.490
decided to do.

00:17:22.490 --> 00:17:23.959
This is a stair.

00:17:23.959 --> 00:17:28.900
That's not so different from stairs that Diller
Scofidio and Renfro and James Corner ultimately

00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:30.420
designed.

00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:31.690
This is a structure.

00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:34.260
This is Stephen Holl's team.

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:38.690
Stephen Holl had a really interesting history
with the High Line long before Robert and

00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:39.730
I came along.

00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:44.310
Stephen was working with another preservationist
who was trying to save the High Line back

00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:49.370
in the mid-90s--a guy named Peter Obletz.

00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:52.570
And they worked together for a little while
and then went their separate ways.

00:17:52.570 --> 00:17:57.990
But Stephen is one of the original High Line
advocates and did an earlier phase of work

00:17:57.990 --> 00:18:00.000
called "Bridge of Houses," which became very
famous.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.300
So, we were thrilled to have him competing
in the end.

00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:05.640
This is another image of his proposal.

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:09.690
But the team we ultimately selected was James
Corner Field Operations, working with Diller

00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:14.780
Scofidio and Renfro and the Dutch horticulturist,
Pete Rudolf.

00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:17.890
And this is a rendering from their competition
entry.

00:18:17.890 --> 00:18:23.360
And it's really interesting how much it is
like what we actually built.

00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:28.601
It's fairly rare for, in a competition phase,
for architects to put forth something that

00:18:28.601 --> 00:18:33.100
doesn't get really drastically modified as
the process goes along.

00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:36.530
And to have the renderings in the competition
phase actually be so close to what we actually

00:18:36.530 --> 00:18:39.110
built is quite unusual.

00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:40.110
You can see the--.

00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:43.940
They were picked for this system that they
created, which they called "planking."

00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:49.050
The walkway system that allowed the grasses
and plants to push up through the concrete

00:18:49.050 --> 00:18:53.050
walkways very much the way that the plants
used to push up through the gravel ballast

00:18:53.050 --> 00:18:54.620
of the High Line.

00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:56.290
And this is also from their competition board.

00:18:56.290 --> 00:19:01.540
And it showed how this system could be--was
a modular system--could be tailored to different

00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:02.890
needs in different spaces.

00:19:02.890 --> 00:19:07.380
So, in areas where you imagined you might
have a lot of people gathering, you could

00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:11.670
have more hardscape--the planking system really
going from one side of the High Line to another--very

00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:14.850
much like it is within the Chelsea Market
Passage.

00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:23.480
And then different ways of varying the percentage
of hardscape to plantings to the point where

00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:27.150
on the far right, you have a condition where
it's planted all the way from one side of

00:19:27.150 --> 00:19:31.790
the High Line to another, which is what they
call the Flyover, the Flyover condition.

00:19:31.790 --> 00:19:35.650
It was something that we thought was just
a concept that we would never do, so it was

00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:38.930
really exciting when we actually ended up
doing it in Section Two.

00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:42.850
So, this is the High Line under construction.

00:19:42.850 --> 00:19:47.851
We did have to ultimately remove all of the
existing landscape that was up there to go

00:19:47.851 --> 00:19:49.830
down to the bare structure.

00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:52.810
We waterproof it, redo the drainage system.

00:19:52.810 --> 00:19:56.520
Actually, the single most expensive part of
the project was repainting the structure.

00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:58.300
It had originally been painted in lead paint.

00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:04.340
So, it had to be put in containment units
and all sandblasted, primed, and repainted.

00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:06.990
It was the single biggest part of the job.

00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:10.900
And then here you can see the rail tracks
being reinstalled.

00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:15.000
Before that rehabilitation of the structure,
we removed all the tracks, but they were all

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.000
surveyed.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.140
So, whenever we put tracks back into the park,
they're the original tracks going back into

00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:21.230
their original locations.

00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:23.500
So, I'm gonna take you just--.

00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:28.610
I'm sure most of you are pretty familiar with
the landscape of the High Line.

00:20:28.610 --> 00:20:31.110
So, I'll just take you on a very quick tour
of it.

00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:32.470
This is down--.

00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:33.470
That walk--.

00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:35.660
Oh, I'm not quite on the tour yet.

00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:41.390
This is that walkway system actually completed
and viewed from above.

00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:47.160
And the plantings, Pete Rudolf was the horticulturist
that we chose.

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:48.800
He was on their team.

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:55.640
And he was selected really because his pallet
of work really reflected what was originally

00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:57.150
up on the High Line.

00:20:57.150 --> 00:21:04.100
He was known for using very naturalistic massings
of grasses and perennials that really evoked

00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:07.980
a natural-looking landscape, which you can
see in this picture here.

00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:14.430
But he added in a lot of new plant species
into the mix so that you'd have vivid displays

00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:15.550
all through the seasons.

00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:20.480
We have things flowering up there basically
from February through November.

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:24.890
There's something that's flowering up on the
High Line.

00:21:24.890 --> 00:21:29.130
This is a section in the Chelsea Grasslands.

00:21:29.130 --> 00:21:33.250
This is things that are flowering up there
right now, the red buds.

00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:37.680
And one of the things that Pete Rudolf specified
was that in the winter, a lot of times in

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:42.410
perennial gardens, all of the dead plant material
gets cut down before winter.

00:21:42.410 --> 00:21:45.870
He specified that it all be left in place,
partly for the health of the plants.

00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:49.240
It protects them from freezing and thawing.

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:55.690
But also because of the beautiful forms of
this dead material all by themselves, or when

00:21:55.690 --> 00:21:57.980
there's snow or ice on them.

00:21:57.980 --> 00:22:03.550
We also had an incredible lighting consultant--Herve
Descottes from L'Observatoire.

00:22:03.550 --> 00:22:07.351
And one of the things they discovered in doing
their night visits to the High Line, before

00:22:07.351 --> 00:22:12.820
designing the lighting system, was that because
it was so dark up there, your pupils didn't

00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:14.370
contract.

00:22:14.370 --> 00:22:18.100
When you're on the streets in New York, you're
constantly passing beneath these very bright

00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:21.230
cones of light from the street lamps and it
makes your pupils contract.

00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:26.090
And it makes it harder to see the night sky
and the buildings that are around you.

00:22:26.090 --> 00:22:28.980
And they noticed when they were up there at
night, they didn't have that condition and

00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:32.910
they could really see the night sky and the
buildings better.

00:22:32.910 --> 00:22:36.510
So, one of the things that they aimed for
in designing the lighting was to always keep

00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:41.510
it waist-level or below so it was never shining
in your eyes, but down on the walkway and

00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:42.510
the plantings.

00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:47.150
And these are the fixtures that they designed
to go into the railings and shine down onto

00:22:47.150 --> 00:22:48.500
the plant material.

00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:51.200
And that's the lighting system as it works
today.

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:55.830
And it's one of the things that makes evenings
on the High Line such a special and magical

00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:57.820
experience really.

00:22:57.820 --> 00:23:02.050
So, just a quick run from south to north from
the High Line.

00:23:02.050 --> 00:23:06.030
Gansevoort Plaza, where the High Line was
chopped off in 1990.

00:23:06.030 --> 00:23:12.490
And it was really jagged-edged, which the
design team proposed to polish it off to use

00:23:12.490 --> 00:23:16.020
as a reveal, like a section of how the High
Line's built.

00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:18.260
And that's it completed.

00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:20.540
And then up the Gansevoort Stairs.

00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:22.220
They designed their stairs.

00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:27.210
They call them "slow stairs" and they were
designed to extend the experience of going

00:23:27.210 --> 00:23:29.330
from street-level to the High Line level.

00:23:29.330 --> 00:23:36.360
So, you had steps that were very gently graded
with long landings and a period in the middle

00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:40.050
where you were actually passing through the
center of the structure and able to reach

00:23:40.050 --> 00:23:44.440
out and touch the beams on the side and the
rivets that were all hammered by hand before

00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:47.820
emerging in the planted environment up above.

00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:52.910
This is another set of those stairs coming
through at 14th Street.

00:23:52.910 --> 00:23:57.070
This is the Diller Von Furstenberg sun deck
between 14th and 15th Street, looking out

00:23:57.070 --> 00:23:58.940
to the river.

00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:03.980
One of the things that we did is we were thinking
about the spaces on the High Line, was thinking

00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:08.280
of it not only as a track to get from one
place to another.

00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:12.560
It was a linear transportation system and
I think people really thought about it a lot

00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:15.460
as a way of moving from one space to another.

00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:19.980
But we really wanted it to be a series of
social gathering spaces as well, where people

00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:24.250
stopped and inhabited the spaces and stayed
for a while.

00:24:24.250 --> 00:24:28.250
And so, that's why we designed these large
chair structures at the Diller Von Furstenberg

00:24:28.250 --> 00:24:32.390
sun deck, which have become really popular
for social gathering spots.

00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:34.730
Also why we brought in the water feature in
that location.

00:24:34.730 --> 00:24:38.900
We're just about to turn it on in about a
week or so.

00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:44.570
And it's one of the things that really draws
people to the spot, kids in particular, taking

00:24:44.570 --> 00:24:46.830
off their shoes and playing in it.

00:24:46.830 --> 00:24:48.710
This is the Chelsea Market Passage.

00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:53.510
One of the amazing things it has in that historic
photo, the train going through the building.

00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:57.390
This is a place where trains passed through
and brought loaded goods in and out of what

00:24:57.390 --> 00:24:59.080
was the old Nabisco factory.

00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:03.460
And it's really one of the things that makes
the High Line such an unusual urban condition.

00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:09.140
You have public space, New York City, public
parkland, which goes through these donut holes

00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:10.390
in private buildings.

00:25:10.390 --> 00:25:16.650
And it's really the only instance that you'll
see of the public occupying this zone within

00:25:16.650 --> 00:25:19.020
a private space.

00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:21.340
The same space at night.

00:25:21.340 --> 00:25:26.870
A wonderful little side walkway just north
of the Chelsea Market Passage.

00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:31.300
And this was always one of Robert's and my
favorite features in Section One--the 10th

00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:32.780
Avenue Square.

00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:36.580
And its design evolved out of the challenge.

00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:37.580
It runs over--.

00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:39.170
This is over 10th Avenue.

00:25:39.170 --> 00:25:43.390
And one of the things that we were gonna have
to do in this location was put up a high fence

00:25:43.390 --> 00:25:50.360
on that northern run to protect against people
throwing things onto the Avenue below.

00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:53.430
And so, we looked at a number of different
design solutions of how you could get away

00:25:53.430 --> 00:25:55.390
with not having it.

00:25:55.390 --> 00:25:59.980
And this was one of a whole bunch of proposals
of how you could actually use the structure

00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:02.200
itself as its own eight-foot high fence.

00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:07.260
And then, it took on a life completely of
its own as a design feature--and amphitheater

00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:09.260
built within this space.

00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:12.170
And here, you can see the incredible amount--.

00:26:12.170 --> 00:26:17.770
It was the biggest engineering feat of the
whole project, was removing the large number

00:26:17.770 --> 00:26:24.000
of massive steel girders that made that square
technically possible--taking them all out,

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.720
re-engineering the whole area so it could
become a little amphitheater in there.

00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:30.240
And there you see it completed.

00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:35.800
And it's really one of the landmark design
features of the High Line.

00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:39.960
You can descend into the structure, watch
the traffic flowing beneath you.

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:44.540
And people stay there for a long time and
just watch the flow of traffic and the life

00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:46.630
of the city streets below.

00:26:46.630 --> 00:26:48.730
It's really a magical place.

00:26:48.730 --> 00:26:53.980
This is the Chelsea Grasslands moving north
at the beginning of the 13th block straightaway

00:26:53.980 --> 00:27:00.590
that runs through West Chelsea, followed by
the Chelsea Thicket, a more enclosed environment.

00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:03.970
What the design team was really looking to
do in this area, because it is a straight

00:27:03.970 --> 00:27:10.650
run that goes for 13 blocks, was thinking
about different ways to create a kind of room

00:27:10.650 --> 00:27:12.310
about every two blocks.

00:27:12.310 --> 00:27:14.500
So, the landscape is cohesive.

00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:19.680
It's the same walkway system that's taking
you through it, but the landscape is changing

00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:20.710
in subtle ways.

00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:24.770
So, it's evolving into very different changing
environments about every two blocks.

00:27:24.770 --> 00:27:29.610
This is the lawn at 23rd Street.

00:27:29.610 --> 00:27:32.950
Very popular gathering spot.

00:27:32.950 --> 00:27:38.030
And benches that were designed to integrate
an old rail platform that used to service

00:27:38.030 --> 00:27:39.670
this warehouse building.

00:27:39.670 --> 00:27:45.570
Those bays with the glass block used to be
loading bays for trains, accepting goods on

00:27:45.570 --> 00:27:47.760
and off the High Line.

00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:52.060
This is the Falcone Flyover between 25th Street
and 27th Street.

00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:56.510
That flyover condition that had been shown
in the competition entry that we thought was

00:27:56.510 --> 00:27:59.680
really just a concept, actually ended up getting
built.

00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:05.000
And it's one of the great features of Section
Two.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:10.360
It runs between these two warehouses that
when the High Line in its original--.

00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:15.450
When we first started going up there, its
original landscape, a forest was growing in-between

00:28:15.450 --> 00:28:19.250
those two warehouses because it was shadier
there and there was better moisture retention.

00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:24.760
So, the plantings that are in the Flyover
area are ultimately gonna recreate that forest

00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:25.760
condition.

00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:30.150
They're gonna come up and envelop the Flyover
and it'll be as if you're walking into the

00:28:30.150 --> 00:28:32.480
canopy of the trees.

00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:35.030
That's the Flyover viewed from above.

00:28:35.030 --> 00:28:40.670
Again, the Flyover viewed from above with
the 26th Street viewing spur.

00:28:40.670 --> 00:28:45.270
Another instance of using a feature on the
High Line as a way to direct your attention

00:28:45.270 --> 00:28:50.270
not to the High Line itself, but to the city
around you--very much like the 10th Avenue

00:28:50.270 --> 00:28:51.270
Square.

00:28:51.270 --> 00:28:52.270
And it's one of the things--.

00:28:52.270 --> 00:28:56.460
The other things I think that's really special
about the High Line as a park.

00:28:56.460 --> 00:29:00.630
Only a small part of the experience is the
zone of the park itself.

00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:04.960
A much bigger experience is the way that you're
looking at the city around you.

00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:10.720
And so, thinking about new ways of directing
a visitor's gaze and framing that gaze are

00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:13.600
a very important part of what the design team
does.

00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:14.600
That's--.

00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:16.290
And it goes both ways.

00:29:16.290 --> 00:29:21.170
Also at the 10th Avenue Square, the view from
the street up to those zones is as interesting

00:29:21.170 --> 00:29:25.780
and compelling as it is when you're up there
looking down.

00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:30.940
This is a zone coming down off of the Flyover
at 27th and 28th Street.

00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:37.320
That same zone is called Wildflower Field,
a simple straight pathway that's planted to

00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:41.610
be reminiscent of the original High Line landscape
that you saw in those Joel Sternfeld photos

00:29:41.610 --> 00:29:43.120
earlier on.

00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:46.220
The same section at night.

00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:51.580
And then, we end at, in Section Two, at a
feature called the 30th Street Cut-Out.

00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:56.000
It's the cement decking that actually held
up the ballast.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:59.920
And the tracks has been removed, been cut
out.

00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:04.100
And this viewing platform is lifted up slightly
so you get these great views out to the Hudson

00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:05.580
River.

00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:10.500
And it's one of the things that the design
team did a lot was to, instead of really concentrating

00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:14.940
on adding major new features, they looked
at ways you could do subtractions the same

00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:19.720
way as the 10th Avenue Square--remove something
to give you a different experience within

00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:20.720
the High Line.

00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:25.809
So, here, the decking has been removed so
that you can see the girders below.

00:30:25.809 --> 00:30:31.260
And this is an elevated shot of the way that
the High Line moves through West Chelsea in

00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:32.260
the Village.

00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:33.380
And I think this is--.

00:30:33.380 --> 00:30:37.560
This is what makes it such a special condition,
that you're snaking through the center of

00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:42.501
these blocks, looking at the city from a perspective
that you otherwise never get to see the city

00:30:42.501 --> 00:30:43.630
from.

00:30:43.630 --> 00:30:47.600
And you can see it bringing us here up to
the West Side Rail Yards.

00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:50.030
&gt;&gt;Robert Hammond: So, one of the ways--.

00:30:50.030 --> 00:30:54.100
One of the reasons it's created so much value
is it's been a boom to development in the

00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:55.100
neighborhood.

00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:59.560
This is a map of over 40 different projects
that have already happened or are in the process

00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:00.560
of happening.

00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:05.230
One of the most exciting is that the Whitney
is moving downtown to the base of the High

00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:06.230
Line.

00:31:06.230 --> 00:31:07.230
It's already under construction.

00:31:07.230 --> 00:31:09.040
This is a design by Renzo Piano.

00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:12.890
It'll be about four or five times as big as
their current space, which they are gonna

00:31:12.890 --> 00:31:15.340
be renting to the Met Museum.

00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:16.610
And they'll be opening this in 2015.

00:31:16.610 --> 00:31:23.780
And that, the little, shorter little building
right there that's black is gonna be our headquarters.

00:31:23.780 --> 00:31:27.130
And we're gonna open that in about, hopefully
next year.

00:31:27.130 --> 00:31:32.490
And the roof will be the largest outdoor sculpture
garden for the Whitney.

00:31:32.490 --> 00:31:36.471
We talked about the 900 million dollars in
added tax revenues.

00:31:36.471 --> 00:31:41.640
And this is just some of the things that's
already happened in and around the High Line.

00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:46.300
There's two billion dollars in new construction
projects, again, in probably the worst economic

00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:49.020
times in a while.

00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:51.390
Twelve thousand jobs.

00:31:51.390 --> 00:31:55.880
The other great thing is it's also not just
regular development.

00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:57.600
A lot of it has been really interesting.

00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:02.180
And there's a spot where you can stand here
at 18th Street and see a building by Frank

00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:05.220
Gehry, Jean Nouvel, Shigeru Ban, Annabelle
Selldorf, Neil Denari.

00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:09.700
So, in addition to running through three historic--.

00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:10.700
Is it three?

00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:11.700
&gt;&gt;Joshua David: Four.

00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:15.520
&gt;&gt;Robert Hammond: Four historic districts,
you can also see some of the best new architecture

00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:17.540
in the city.

00:32:17.540 --> 00:32:21.890
So, when Josh and I met, one of the first
things we did was start Friends of the High

00:32:21.890 --> 00:32:22.890
Line.

00:32:22.890 --> 00:32:25.970
And that's what is still running the park
now.

00:32:25.970 --> 00:32:30.440
And it's really this public/private partnership
and it was modeled after the Central Park

00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:31.440
Conservancy.

00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:32.720
So, we're a private group.

00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:39.080
We don't work for the city that manages and
operates the park for the city.

00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:42.630
We pay for a hundred percent of all the costs
of maintaining it.

00:32:42.630 --> 00:32:45.980
The city pays for security and liability.

00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:49.330
But the gardener--that's one of our gardeners,
Johnny.

00:32:49.330 --> 00:32:52.970
All the gardeners, the maintenance workers,
the people taking out the trash, are all our

00:32:52.970 --> 00:32:53.970
employees.

00:32:53.970 --> 00:32:55.640
And they're paid for by members.

00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:59.420
If anybody wants to become a member, we love
members.

00:32:59.420 --> 00:33:01.830
Its membership starts at 70 dollars.

00:33:01.830 --> 00:33:05.920
And they're working through all different
seasons.

00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:07.650
That was not this year.

00:33:07.650 --> 00:33:12.360
[laughs] And it is really hard to remove snow
because we can't use salt.

00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:16.160
We have to do it all by hand and machine because
the salt--.

00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:19.420
The planting, the water is recycled into the
planting beds.

00:33:19.420 --> 00:33:22.630
So, if you use salt, it'll go into the plants.

00:33:22.630 --> 00:33:27.250
So, we originally thought we'd have about
300 thousand visitors a year.

00:33:27.250 --> 00:33:29.080
That's about how many the Whitney gets in
a year.

00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:31.120
So, we thought that would be a good comparable.

00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:34.280
Last year, we had three point seven million
visitors.

00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:37.210
Our busiest day was Father's Day.

00:33:37.210 --> 00:33:40.500
It would be interesting now, I sort of wanna
see a competition between Mother's Day and

00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:41.500
Father's Day.

00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:42.500
&gt;&gt;Joshua David: Mmm.

00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:44.590
&gt;&gt;Robert Hammond: We hadn't opened Section
Two, so maybe that's why the dads went out

00:33:44.590 --> 00:33:46.480
last year.

00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:54.100
But just to see where the High Line lies with
other institutions, we have about almost a

00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:57.740
million more than MoMa.

00:33:57.740 --> 00:33:59.210
And this is crazy.

00:33:59.210 --> 00:34:05.160
The Travel and Leisure did this poll of the
20 top world destinations.

00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:08.679
And I think it's a little ridiculous we're
ahead of the Acropolis, but--.

00:34:08.679 --> 00:34:09.679
[laughter]

00:34:09.679 --> 00:34:10.679
&gt;&gt;Joshua David: Mmm.

00:34:10.679 --> 00:34:15.210
&gt;&gt;Robert Hammond: One of the things that is
a fear of ours, that it becomes just for tourists.

00:34:15.210 --> 00:34:16.210
And we want--.

00:34:16.210 --> 00:34:19.270
And we're glad tourists visit and that it's
very popular, but we really want it mainly

00:34:19.270 --> 00:34:21.220
to be for New Yorkers.

00:34:21.220 --> 00:34:24.940
So, we do over 300 free programs throughout
the year.

00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:27.520
And almost all of them are geared towards
locals.

00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:29.619
A lot of them are kids-oriented.

00:34:29.619 --> 00:34:33.839
This is a Step Festival we started last year
where kids compete from all five boroughs.

00:34:33.839 --> 00:34:35.589
We're gonna be doing it again in June.

00:34:35.589 --> 00:34:38.019
We do a lot of kid's programming.

00:34:38.019 --> 00:34:43.009
This is in that 10th Avenue Square where we
used as an amphitheater.

00:34:43.009 --> 00:34:44.239
Every--.

00:34:44.239 --> 00:34:48.750
Throughout the summer, every Wednesdays and
Saturdays, we have something called Children's

00:34:48.750 --> 00:34:55.700
Play, where they can build their own High
Line-esque structures.

00:34:55.700 --> 00:34:57.690
We do a lot of musical performances.

00:34:57.690 --> 00:34:58.690
We have salsa.

00:34:58.690 --> 00:35:06.059
We're gonna have salsa dancing every Thursday
night once a month throughout the summer.

00:35:06.059 --> 00:35:09.809
And we have stargazing every Thursday night
from now until the fall.

00:35:09.809 --> 00:35:15.059
You just go up there and there's astronomers
up there that will bring up their telescopes

00:35:15.059 --> 00:35:16.059
[Joshua David coughs] for you to look at.

00:35:16.059 --> 00:35:19.819
And I didn't even know you could see any stars
in New York, but you can actually see the

00:35:19.819 --> 00:35:21.210
rings of Saturn.

00:35:21.210 --> 00:35:25.900
This is sort of an unfortunate slide because
you know one of the most famous things about

00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:29.420
the High Line is watching people have sex
in the standard windows.

00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:32.099
It's more of an urban myth than a reality.

00:35:32.099 --> 00:35:33.099
But that's not what--.

00:35:33.099 --> 00:35:36.759
When you see the people with telescopes, that's
not what they're there for.

00:35:36.759 --> 00:35:37.759
[laughter]

00:35:37.759 --> 00:35:40.640
Yeah, this is one picture of that.

00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:44.400
One of the other things we do to keep, for
locals, and a reason to keep coming back is

00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:48.039
art, is public art on the High Line.

00:35:48.039 --> 00:35:51.049
This is a work by Spencer Finch.

00:35:51.049 --> 00:35:52.269
And almost all of it is temporary.

00:35:52.269 --> 00:35:53.269
So, it changes.

00:35:53.269 --> 00:35:58.690
So, if you go up there right now, about 21st
Street, this is a work by Sara Zee.

00:35:58.690 --> 00:36:00.849
It's actually going away in June.

00:36:00.849 --> 00:36:02.329
So, it's always changing.

00:36:02.329 --> 00:36:06.019
At any one time, there's about five or six
different projects up there.

00:36:06.019 --> 00:36:07.609
This is where we--.

00:36:07.609 --> 00:36:09.619
The developer had given up this billboard.

00:36:09.619 --> 00:36:13.249
This is that Joel Sternfeld photo.

00:36:13.249 --> 00:36:15.329
These are all different artworks.

00:36:15.329 --> 00:36:20.961
This was a John Baldessari piece we put up
in the spirit of Christmas in December, which

00:36:20.961 --> 00:36:25.329
was a hundred thousand dollar bill, which
was an actual legal tender that banks use

00:36:25.329 --> 00:36:27.829
between themselves to transfer money.

00:36:27.829 --> 00:36:30.999
And he blew it up the size of a billboard.

00:36:30.999 --> 00:36:32.799
So, the High Line's also not done.

00:36:32.799 --> 00:36:34.039
We have some great art.

00:36:34.039 --> 00:36:37.480
And we have some great performances coming
up on Earth Day.

00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:44.369
There's a woman named Alison Spear, who's
doing this thing called "Make a Salad," where

00:36:44.369 --> 00:36:48.640
she had this work in the '60s where she'd
throw lettuce off a building and onto a tarp.

00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:50.819
And then throw tomatoes and salad dressing.

00:36:50.819 --> 00:36:53.499
And everyone does the tarp up and down.

00:36:53.499 --> 00:36:55.279
And then, she serves the salad.

00:36:55.279 --> 00:36:58.089
We're gonna do it off the High Line on Earth
Day.

00:36:58.089 --> 00:37:00.619
&gt;&gt;Joshua David: Free salad for a thousand
people.

00:37:00.619 --> 00:37:01.619
&gt;&gt;Robert Hammond: Yes.

00:37:01.619 --> 00:37:02.680
So we're not done.

00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:06.630
There's the last section of the High Line,
which is this part right here.

00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:07.809
And it runs around the rail yards.

00:37:07.809 --> 00:37:13.380
This is the last, largest undeveloped site
in Manhattan.

00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:18.249
Here's where the Olympic Stadium was originally
gonna go here when New York was competing

00:37:18.249 --> 00:37:20.170
against London, which won.

00:37:20.170 --> 00:37:22.410
And it was gonna be the Jets Stadium as well.

00:37:22.410 --> 00:37:24.440
It's the most beautiful part of the High Line.

00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:26.460
Most of Joel's photographs were taken there.

00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:29.040
You get great Hudson River views.

00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:30.040
This was--.

00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:33.940
That's the Jets Stadium that was defeated
by the community.

00:37:33.940 --> 00:37:42.009
But now, it's gonna be developed for mixed-use
of retail, commercial, and residential by

00:37:42.009 --> 00:37:43.460
the related companies.

00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:46.390
So, it's gonna be 12 million square feet.

00:37:46.390 --> 00:37:53.390
So, that's like downtown Seattle times two
all squeezed into these two sites with the

00:37:53.390 --> 00:37:55.180
High Line running all the way around it.

00:37:55.180 --> 00:37:56.940
And at first, they actually wanted to tear--.

00:37:56.940 --> 00:38:01.259
Some people wanted to tear down the High Line
because they thought it would be easier to

00:38:01.259 --> 00:38:05.059
develop if it was just an open site.

00:38:05.059 --> 00:38:06.650
But we've won that battle.

00:38:06.650 --> 00:38:08.349
And the city's been really supportive.

00:38:08.349 --> 00:38:12.010
And everyone's agreed to keep all of the High
Line.

00:38:12.010 --> 00:38:17.930
And our goal right now is to try to fully
build-out this portion of the High Line in

00:38:17.930 --> 00:38:18.930
blue.

00:38:18.930 --> 00:38:23.009
And then this green part, to do a temporary
walkway that could last for five or ten years,

00:38:23.009 --> 00:38:28.460
that would get us all the way to 34th Street
by 2014.

00:38:28.460 --> 00:38:31.280
And that's, it would be all the way to where
the Javits Center is.

00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:35.410
And there's gonna be a new Number Seven subway--the
first new subway in Manhattan--I think in

00:38:35.410 --> 00:38:36.410
75 years.

00:38:36.410 --> 00:38:38.420
It's gonna open up around then, too.

00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:40.089
I'm gonna skip.

00:38:40.089 --> 00:38:42.160
I think we have some just--.

00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:45.290
I wanted to show some of the slides of--.

00:38:45.290 --> 00:38:46.290
Oh, no.

00:38:46.290 --> 00:38:47.349
We don't have them in here.

00:38:47.349 --> 00:38:48.349
I don't know.

00:38:48.349 --> 00:38:49.349
Can you--?

00:38:49.349 --> 00:38:50.910
Can you go back?

00:38:50.910 --> 00:38:52.490
Oh, sorry.

00:38:52.490 --> 00:38:56.420
[laughs] But what I wanted to show, and I
guess we didn't include them in here, is some

00:38:56.420 --> 00:38:59.040
of the new slides for Section Three.

00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:02.530
So, we've just released the designs of the
final section.

00:39:02.530 --> 00:39:06.130
You can find them on our website that are
all there.

00:39:06.130 --> 00:39:07.130
And that's where we're--.

00:39:07.130 --> 00:39:11.339
We're still working on those and that's why
we've had so far, two community input sessions

00:39:11.339 --> 00:39:12.849
on those designs.

00:39:12.849 --> 00:39:15.680
So, people still have a chance to shape--.

00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:17.460
&gt;&gt;Joshua David: Yeah, at the end.

00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:21.280
&gt;&gt;Robert Hammond: what's happening there.

00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:26.130
And I also wanna end on this.

00:39:26.130 --> 00:39:30.009
This is my favorite programming that we didn't
even plan.

00:39:30.009 --> 00:39:35.461
So, when we opened Section One in 2009, we
misdirected one of the lights that was supposed

00:39:35.461 --> 00:39:36.640
to shine on the stairs.

00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:39.559
And it shone in this woman's bedroom.

00:39:39.559 --> 00:39:45.839
And she called to complain and we didn't do
anything 'cause we were busy.

00:39:45.839 --> 00:39:49.069
But she, like a good New Yorker, made the
best of the situation.

00:39:49.069 --> 00:39:55.650
And she had a friend who was a cabaret singer,
would go out on her fire escape and serenade

00:39:55.650 --> 00:39:57.470
the High Line, people on the High Line.

00:39:57.470 --> 00:40:00.390
She named it the Renegade Cabaret.

00:40:00.390 --> 00:40:07.040
It lasted for several months until her landlord
told her she couldn't go out on her fire escape

00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:08.650
anymore unless there's a fire.

00:40:08.650 --> 00:40:13.680
So, but to me, what I like is it's just a
symbol how New Yorkers can respond to different

00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:14.680
things.

00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:16.030
The High Line itself was an accident.

00:40:16.030 --> 00:40:21.039
It was meant to be a loaded freight line that
fell into disuse mostly in the '90s.

00:40:21.039 --> 00:40:24.210
And the last train was in 1980.

00:40:24.210 --> 00:40:29.430
So, it was an accidental park and so the kind
of programming that comes around accidentally

00:40:29.430 --> 00:40:33.910
is to me what's, I think, most interesting
about the High Line.

00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:38.500
So, I think we have a few minutes to answer
questions.

00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:40.319
I guess I have a question for y’all.

00:40:40.319 --> 00:40:43.140
Last time I came and spoke, everyone was on
their laptop working.

00:40:43.140 --> 00:40:44.309
I don't know.

00:40:44.309 --> 00:40:46.309
Is that a new culture that y’all do it?

00:40:46.309 --> 00:40:51.349
I mean, it's nice that y’all are actually
looking at us, but I can't imagine that we've

00:40:51.349 --> 00:40:53.260
gotten much better at speaking.

00:40:53.260 --> 00:40:54.260
But--.

00:40:54.260 --> 00:40:58.480
&gt;&gt;male #2: You spoke about how one of those
things that's going up near the undeveloped

00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:01.390
space is gonna last for just ten years.

00:41:01.390 --> 00:41:02.390
Why is that?

00:41:02.390 --> 00:41:03.390
Why not longer?

00:41:03.390 --> 00:41:04.880
&gt;&gt;Robert Hammond: Yeah.

00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:06.499
So, we wanna open--.

00:41:06.499 --> 00:41:10.369
We don't have enough money, basically, to
build the whole High Line out.

00:41:10.369 --> 00:41:14.210
It would cost about a hundred million dollars
to build the full walkway.

00:41:14.210 --> 00:41:16.150
And so, we only have about half that.

00:41:16.150 --> 00:41:21.339
So, we're gonna build half of it fully and
then put a temporary walkway.

00:41:21.339 --> 00:41:25.869
Some people said, "Well, why can't you just
keep the temporary walkway permanently?"

00:41:25.869 --> 00:41:27.700
'Cause that's sort of an interesting condition.

00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:32.019
But ultimately, we have to go through and
remediate the space.

00:41:32.019 --> 00:41:37.049
So, we have to go in and do the lead paint
remediation Josh talked about.

00:41:37.049 --> 00:41:41.009
And we have to go in and remove all of the,
put in new waterproofing.

00:41:41.009 --> 00:41:45.790
So, it'll last five to ten years and then,
we would build-out it to a permanent level.

00:41:45.790 --> 00:41:50.740
So, the idea is the walkway would be finished
after that.

00:41:50.740 --> 00:41:55.710
&gt;&gt;male #3: So, I think I might have been there
that Father's Day.

00:41:55.710 --> 00:41:56.710
[Robert Hammond laughs]

00:41:56.710 --> 00:41:57.710
It was really crowded.

00:41:57.710 --> 00:41:58.710
&gt;&gt;Robert Hammond: Yeah.

00:41:58.710 --> 00:42:01.029
&gt;&gt;male #3: I mean, it's of course gonna get
more crowded.

00:42:01.029 --> 00:42:04.789
So, what's the plan to somehow deal with that?

00:42:04.789 --> 00:42:09.000
I mean, it's great that there's a lot of people,
but as it gets more crowded, you can enjoy

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:10.320
less of it, right?

00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:15.599
&gt;&gt;Joshua David: I think it is one of the real
challenges that we're looking at right now

00:42:15.599 --> 00:42:19.280
and looking at different ways that we can
address it.

00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:20.280
One of the things that--.

00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:24.119
The easiest way to deal with it is people
who are in the neighborhood or here every

00:42:24.119 --> 00:42:28.960
day, is to think about the majority of times
it's not crowded.

00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:33.930
There are lots of many beautiful times of
day to go--early in the morning, late in the

00:42:33.930 --> 00:42:38.279
evening, during the week almost all the time
is manageable.

00:42:38.279 --> 00:42:44.970
There are two very crowded times, which are
Saturday from 11:30 to about 5:30, and Sunday

00:42:44.970 --> 00:42:46.799
from 11:30 to about 5:30.

00:42:46.799 --> 00:42:52.180
So, those are times that as people who live
and/or work in the neighborhood, you have

00:42:52.180 --> 00:42:55.589
the opportunity to take advantage of times
when it's not so crowded.

00:42:55.589 --> 00:42:59.269
And we are looking at those more crowded times.

00:42:59.269 --> 00:43:02.309
We're just about to start a new strategic
planning process.

00:43:02.309 --> 00:43:07.960
And one of their group of central questions
that we're asking ourselves as an organization

00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:09.299
and that's one of them.

00:43:09.299 --> 00:43:12.099
How do you handle that issue?

00:43:12.099 --> 00:43:16.089
Because it's not the experience that we created
the High Line to have.

00:43:16.089 --> 00:43:17.550
It's great to be popular.

00:43:17.550 --> 00:43:18.750
It's great to be loved.

00:43:18.750 --> 00:43:20.789
But that's really challenging.

00:43:20.789 --> 00:43:25.710
We did experiment when we opened Section One
and a little bit when we opened Section Two.

00:43:25.710 --> 00:43:30.950
When we know there are gonna be very intense
crowds, based on something dramatic happening,

00:43:30.950 --> 00:43:32.119
like the opening.

00:43:32.119 --> 00:43:35.229
We actually did have to regulate the number
of people who came in.

00:43:35.229 --> 00:43:41.109
And so, at those times, entrance points got
closed and you could only enter at one point.

00:43:41.109 --> 00:43:42.789
And there was a line.

00:43:42.789 --> 00:43:45.380
And that is a way that you can regulate it.

00:43:45.380 --> 00:43:49.390
It's very labor-intensive, very expensive,
and people don't like it.

00:43:49.390 --> 00:43:53.380
So, you have a whole bunch of negatives associated
with that system.

00:43:53.380 --> 00:43:55.390
So, I don't think--.

00:43:55.390 --> 00:43:57.900
That's not the answer, but we are looking
to further answers.

00:43:57.900 --> 00:44:02.900
&gt;&gt;Robert Hammond: One of the dilemmas is also,
when we were thinking about Section Three,

00:44:02.900 --> 00:44:06.380
one of the answers is you can make the path
wider so there's more room.

00:44:06.380 --> 00:44:09.279
But the problem is, that takes away from the
planting.

00:44:09.279 --> 00:44:13.430
I mean, with Section Two, we actually had,
the path is narrower.

00:44:13.430 --> 00:44:15.880
So, you have more planting to path.

00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:20.999
So, it feels more crowded, but for most people,
we hear they like it more because there's

00:44:20.999 --> 00:44:21.999
more plantings.

00:44:21.999 --> 00:44:23.470
So, there's the dilemma.

00:44:23.470 --> 00:44:24.549
It's like highways.

00:44:24.549 --> 00:44:26.000
Do you add another highway?

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:28.079
But then, you'd just get more people.

00:44:28.079 --> 00:44:31.329
So, it's one of the things of trying to find
that right balance.

00:44:31.329 --> 00:44:38.099
&gt;&gt;male #4: How did you, or how do you, plan
for very large plants that wanna get even

00:44:38.099 --> 00:44:39.099
larger?

00:44:39.099 --> 00:44:41.809
Like a tree that wants to grow 60 feet, who's
roots can only go down so far.

00:44:41.809 --> 00:44:46.569
&gt;&gt;Joshua David: Most of the trees have been
selected to be moderate in size and to have

00:44:46.569 --> 00:44:51.059
root systems that deal with the very confined
nature of the High Line.

00:44:51.059 --> 00:44:55.210
One of the things when we planted it and opened
it, we really didn't know these plants were

00:44:55.210 --> 00:44:56.210
gonna do.

00:44:56.210 --> 00:44:57.210
It's a very forbidding condition.

00:44:57.210 --> 00:44:59.779
There's only about that much soil there.

00:44:59.779 --> 00:45:02.430
It's about 14 inches of soil.

00:45:02.430 --> 00:45:07.210
And so for trees, that's an extra challenging
situation.

00:45:07.210 --> 00:45:12.630
Where there are a lot of trees, we've done
some subtle additions to the way the planting

00:45:12.630 --> 00:45:15.549
beds are designed to allow for more soil depth.

00:45:15.549 --> 00:45:18.799
You see this down at the very southern end
of the High Line--what we call the Gansevoort

00:45:18.799 --> 00:45:22.650
Woodlands, where there's a very dense grouping
of trees.

00:45:22.650 --> 00:45:28.539
We've added a COR-TEN steel edge to the planting
bed, which gives us another two feet or so

00:45:28.539 --> 00:45:31.869
of soil so that we can have all of those trees
there.

00:45:31.869 --> 00:45:32.869
Those are also--.

00:45:32.869 --> 00:45:37.769
Now, the whole High Line has an irrigation
system, but in the beginning, it was designed

00:45:37.769 --> 00:45:39.880
just to have irrigation where the trees were.

00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:43.930
So, they were given special watering systems
as well.

00:45:43.930 --> 00:45:49.289
And I think over time, eventually, the root
systems will get too big on some of the trees

00:45:49.289 --> 00:45:55.729
and they'll have to be replaced, as happens
in a lot of parks that have trees growing

00:45:55.729 --> 00:45:57.920
in planters or confined areas.

00:45:57.920 --> 00:45:59.890
&gt;&gt;Robert Hammond: And one other thing.

00:45:59.890 --> 00:46:03.510
The planting depth is the average planting
depth is about 13 inches.

00:46:03.510 --> 00:46:06.190
So, that's one of the amazing things that's
actually worked.

00:46:06.190 --> 00:46:08.690
And you're basically on a bridge.

00:46:08.690 --> 00:46:12.309
So, it heats from below and above.

00:46:12.309 --> 00:46:14.289
And it's amazing that it--.

00:46:14.289 --> 00:46:17.539
We were worried with all these plants that
they'd survive.

00:46:17.539 --> 00:46:21.559
But a lot of them were selected about, I think
a quarter of them were actually plants that

00:46:21.559 --> 00:46:22.900
were already growing up there.

00:46:22.900 --> 00:46:25.650
So, we knew that they could thrive in that
kind of environment.

00:46:25.650 --> 00:46:29.660
&gt;&gt;Joshua David: And the, what was up there
to begin with before we started, it was gravel.

00:46:29.660 --> 00:46:31.259
There was not even any dirt in it.

00:46:31.259 --> 00:46:37.950
So, it really, it has always shown remarkable
resiliency of nature to grow and vary in inhospitable

00:46:37.950 --> 00:46:38.950
conditions.

00:46:38.950 --> 00:46:42.710
And I think it's continuing to do that now.

00:46:42.710 --> 00:46:45.940
&gt;&gt;male #5: I'm just curious.

00:46:45.940 --> 00:46:51.539
With so many stakeholders with vested interests
in the various stages of your proposal, whether

00:46:51.539 --> 00:46:55.270
it was the design competition, or whether
it was probably the transfer of property rights,

00:46:55.270 --> 00:46:57.809
I was wondering who had ultimate decision-making
authority.

00:46:57.809 --> 00:47:02.279
If it was the two of you, I'm wondering how
you were able to achieve that given--.

00:47:02.279 --> 00:47:04.450
You guys weren't subject matter experts in
design.

00:47:04.450 --> 00:47:05.450
You're not architects.

00:47:05.450 --> 00:47:06.690
You're not urban planners.

00:47:06.690 --> 00:47:11.380
So, was it just that you were the first two
of the most enthusiastic and so it gave you

00:47:11.380 --> 00:47:12.380
that right?

00:47:12.380 --> 00:47:14.839
&gt;&gt;Joshua David: Ultimately, it's a city project.

00:47:14.839 --> 00:47:19.960
So, when we were designing and building, it's
ultimately the decisions all go up to the

00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:20.960
city.

00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:25.890
That said, it's been a remarkable partnership
between us and the Bloomberg Administration.

00:47:25.890 --> 00:47:29.589
I think what was interesting was at the very
beginning, when the Bloomberg Administration

00:47:29.589 --> 00:47:34.700
decided it wanted to do the High Line, they
were buying into an idea that they didn't

00:47:34.700 --> 00:47:37.410
know very much about and we knew a lot about.

00:47:37.410 --> 00:47:43.440
So, they welcomed us into a partnership that
was very productive because we had, at that

00:47:43.440 --> 00:47:46.569
point, we'd assembled some expertise on it.

00:47:46.569 --> 00:47:52.349
And the design team selection process was,
I think, a really unusual and interesting

00:47:52.349 --> 00:47:59.279
example of the city and a non-profit working
collaboratively together around a table with

00:47:59.279 --> 00:48:02.079
basically the same number of people on each
side.

00:48:02.079 --> 00:48:06.920
We always acknowledged that ultimately, the
city had the call on anything that was gonna

00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:07.920
happen up there.

00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:15.650
But they gave us a very wide degree of discretion
in directing how the design was gonna go.

00:48:15.650 --> 00:48:18.140
And so, I think it's been a really amazing
partnership.

00:48:18.140 --> 00:48:23.349
There is also one element of the project that
goes up to the federal government level.

00:48:23.349 --> 00:48:27.299
We're what's called a rail banked park, or
a rail banked trail.

00:48:27.299 --> 00:48:35.510
There are different ways that railroads can
be reused as trails or park land.

00:48:35.510 --> 00:48:37.979
And rail banking is one sector of that.

00:48:37.979 --> 00:48:42.450
It's essentially a program that was created
by the government to allow rail carders that

00:48:42.450 --> 00:48:49.019
go over private property to be maintained
and used for other uses without losing their,

00:48:49.019 --> 00:48:51.839
without the easement going poof into the air.

00:48:51.839 --> 00:48:54.359
So, that all had to go through a federal approval
process.

00:48:54.359 --> 00:48:56.650
&gt;&gt;Robert Hammond: I mean, the other thing
is money.

00:48:56.650 --> 00:48:57.650
[laughter]

00:48:57.650 --> 00:49:02.519
We were raising private money, so that's also
what gave us a place at the table on important

00:49:02.519 --> 00:49:04.569
design decisions.

00:49:04.569 --> 00:49:10.880
And still gives us the role to be able to
run it because we're raising private money

00:49:10.880 --> 00:49:15.930
to help supplement what would otherwise have
to be paid for by the public.

00:49:15.930 --> 00:49:23.349
&gt;&gt;male #6: I noticed a change with the lighting
in the Chelsea Market Pass Through.

00:49:23.349 --> 00:49:25.290
Initially, it was blue at night.

00:49:25.290 --> 00:49:30.270
And it had two sets of fluorescent tubes,
one blue and one white for, I think, day.

00:49:30.270 --> 00:49:34.880
And it looked like it started running both
of those tubes at night to make it more brighter

00:49:34.880 --> 00:49:36.719
and also purple.

00:49:36.719 --> 00:49:39.029
Is that true or can you tell us the story
why that changed?

00:49:39.029 --> 00:49:40.029
&gt;&gt;Robert Hammond: Yeah.

00:49:40.029 --> 00:49:43.640
So, I mean, there's a lot of back history
of the lighting in Chelsea Market.

00:49:43.640 --> 00:49:48.390
One, we insisted on having it dimmer, which
the Parks Department was like, "Why does a

00:49:48.390 --> 00:49:49.390
park need a dimmer?"

00:49:49.390 --> 00:49:50.700
And I'm saying it was very important.

00:49:50.700 --> 00:49:51.700
&gt;&gt;Joshua David: Mm-hmm.

00:49:51.700 --> 00:49:53.890
&gt;&gt;Robert Hammond: But that was to try to create--.

00:49:53.890 --> 00:49:56.970
If you just do the white light, it can be
very harsh.

00:49:56.970 --> 00:50:03.309
And so, if you do the white and the white
and blue light, it creates a warmer light

00:50:03.309 --> 00:50:04.309
when you're in there.

00:50:04.309 --> 00:50:06.529
It's more flattering as well.

00:50:06.529 --> 00:50:09.309
But the artist, during the day, doesn't like--.

00:50:09.309 --> 00:50:12.180
There's the art piece on the wall.

00:50:12.180 --> 00:50:14.509
Doesn't like how it looks with the blue light.

00:50:14.509 --> 00:50:19.130
So, we try to use the light as little as possible.

00:50:19.130 --> 00:50:22.710
And the blue light mainly just on certain
occasions.

00:50:22.710 --> 00:50:25.010
On the 14th Street passage, we use both.

00:50:25.010 --> 00:50:26.509
But it's really intended--.

00:50:26.509 --> 00:50:31.069
You can do blue or white, but it's really
intended to have them both on at the same

00:50:31.069 --> 00:50:32.069
time in the evening.

00:50:32.069 --> 00:50:34.430
&gt;&gt;male #6: That was one of my favorite things,
was just the blue light only at night.

00:50:34.430 --> 00:50:38.479
I mean, in the day, you can do different things,
but I thought that was cool.

00:50:38.479 --> 00:50:39.479
&gt;&gt;Robert Hammond: Yeah.

00:50:39.479 --> 00:50:42.849
The lighting is done by a guy named Herve
Descottes from L'Observatoire who came up

00:50:42.849 --> 00:50:43.849
with that.

00:50:43.849 --> 00:50:45.779
&gt;&gt;male moderator: I think we have time for
one more question.

00:50:45.779 --> 00:50:47.779
&gt;&gt;male #7: So, congrats.

00:50:47.779 --> 00:50:50.309
It's an amazing achievement.

00:50:50.309 --> 00:50:53.619
The Meatpacking District is unrecognizable
today, right?

00:50:53.619 --> 00:51:03.210
And so, some of it was not dependent on your
contribution, but you've actually accelerated

00:51:03.210 --> 00:51:04.519
the development of this neighborhood.

00:51:04.519 --> 00:51:11.359
Did you do anything to try to protect some
of the historical establishments and businesses

00:51:11.359 --> 00:51:12.359
in the area?

00:51:12.359 --> 00:51:17.249
'Cause for example, you can see the Whitney
sitting on top of all the Meatpacking District

00:51:17.249 --> 00:51:18.249
locations, right?

00:51:18.249 --> 00:51:23.779
&gt;&gt;Robert Hammond: I mean, I think the High
Line gets too much credit and too much blame

00:51:23.779 --> 00:51:24.779
in some ways.

00:51:24.779 --> 00:51:31.569
[laughs] I mean, the Meatpacking was changing
gangbusters way before we opened in 2009.

00:51:31.569 --> 00:51:33.589
Florent had left before we opened.

00:51:33.589 --> 00:51:37.529
I mean, I think the die was already set for
this.

00:51:37.529 --> 00:51:41.180
But one of the great things that actually
Florent accomplished around the same time

00:51:41.180 --> 00:51:45.900
we were getting started was making this an
historic district.

00:51:45.900 --> 00:51:52.339
So, what that means is one, you can't change
a lot of the height, the character, like the

00:51:52.339 --> 00:51:53.819
steel awnings.

00:51:53.819 --> 00:51:59.039
The other thing that the neighborhood fought
and won for was not having residential.

00:51:59.039 --> 00:52:07.579
And that's partly why it's such an entertainment
zone for bars and clubs and restaurants.

00:52:07.579 --> 00:52:14.529
But it's also helped keep the character of
the buildings and not having them be all residential.

00:52:14.529 --> 00:52:16.660
In certain ways, we don't have a lot of control.

00:52:16.660 --> 00:52:21.130
We have control of what happens to the High
Line, but on what happens outside of it is

00:52:21.130 --> 00:52:23.349
a little bit out of our control.

00:52:23.349 --> 00:52:26.510
We can help certain people and work.

00:52:26.510 --> 00:52:29.700
The good news about the Meat Market, the building--.

00:52:29.700 --> 00:52:35.210
As part of the Whitney going in, the city
signed a long-term lease with the remaining

00:52:35.210 --> 00:52:38.210
Meat Market vendors that are still there.

00:52:38.210 --> 00:52:41.010
So, they'll be there for another at least
another 20 years.

00:52:41.010 --> 00:52:42.690
&gt;&gt;male #7: Thanks.

00:52:42.690 --> 00:52:44.369
&gt;&gt;Joshua David: Great.

00:52:44.369 --> 00:52:46.049
Well, thank you.

00:52:46.049 --> 00:52:46.599
[applause]
