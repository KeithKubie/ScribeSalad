00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.400
Here is a bad sequence of updates for
this particular example.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.240
So I rewrote the value function for all
the different states, all seven states.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.070
They're all remember dot products of
the weights with the feature vectors.

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.264
So V(1) can be written as W0 + 2W1.

00:00:16.264 --> 00:00:19.540
V(2) can be written as W0 + 2W2.

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:20.560
And so on.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:26.900
State seven is the weird one,
right, that has 7W0 + W7 and

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.350
we have to change the w values so

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:32.720
that we actually are representing
the value function correctly.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.510
So let's consider the case we start off.

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.030
We're going to get this process
going with the weights positive and

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.270
the value of state seven
much bigger than the others.

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.270
And we're going to update
things round robin.

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.830
We're going to say
after a transition from

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.490
state one to state seven using
the only action that we've got and

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:51.890
getting no reward,
because there's no reward.

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.191
We update when we go from state two to
state seven, state three to state seven,

00:00:55.191 --> 00:00:57.741
state four to state seven,
state five state to state seven,

00:00:57.741 --> 00:01:00.360
state six to state seven,
and seven back to itself.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.050
So these are all the possible
transitions in this MVP.

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.020
So we'll just update all
of them one at a time.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.790
And then do it again, repeat.

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.840
And just for concreteness, let's say
that the discount factor's point nine,

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.660
and the learning rate is point one.

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:15.959
And let's see what happens.

00:01:15.959 --> 00:01:16.459
&gt;&gt; Okay.
