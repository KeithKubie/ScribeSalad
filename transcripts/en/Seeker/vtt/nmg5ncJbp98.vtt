00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.180
New research shows that the couple who sleeps
together, stays together!

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:12.019
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and I don’t
think I’m alone when I publicly declare

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:13.460
that cuddling is awesome.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.200
It’s warm, it’s soft - and according to
new research, it’s good for your health

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.660
AND your relationship.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.900
A 2009 study from the University of Pittsburgh
found that women in long-term, stable relationships

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.060
tend to fall asleep more quickly and wake
up fewer times during the night, than women

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.750
who are single or in unstable relationships.

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.720
Other studies, in recent years, paint a different
image - saying that both men and women move

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.800
around more when sleeping together.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.190
But according to Wendy Troxel, a psychology
professor at the University of Pittsburgh,

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.800
the psychological benefits of co-sleeping
outweigh the physical downsides.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.489
The science behind it is still unclear, she
says, but there are a few theories as to why

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:51.590
this is.

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.510
One hypothesis is that for couples in healthy
relationships, sleeping together promotes

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.059
feelings of safety and security, which may
lower levels of the stress hormone cortisol.

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.939
It could also reduce cytokines, which promote
inflammation, as well as boost oxytocin - a

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:07.369
hormone that’s been shown to ease anxiety.

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:12.259
Whatever the reason, it seems one thing is
clear: a happy relationship, leads to better

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:13.259
sleeping.

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:14.259
And vice versa.

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:18.820
A 2010 study of 29 couples, found that women
who had fewer negative interactions with their

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.850
partners during the day, also slept better
at night.

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.600
And for men, it was the same - but with one
additional caveat: better sleep also led to

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.610
fewer negative interactions the next day.

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.549
According to Christina McCrea, an associate
professor at the University of Florida, clearing

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:36.700
up any relationship issues can often ease
insomnia.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.640
But what about couples who have different
sleeping schedules?

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.420
Do they still reap the benefits of sleeping
together?

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.439
Well, it seems the answer is “not quite.”

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:50.469
According to a 1991 study, couples who went
to bed and woke up at different times, tended

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:55.520
to argue more, spent less time together in
shared activities, and had slightly less sex.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.939
Unfortunately, your body’s internal clock
isn’t easy to change.

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:03.469
So most sleep specialists suggest that couples
who have mismatched sleeping times, arrange

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:08.170
a “special bedroom time” where they both
go to bed, spend some time together, and then

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.739
the night owl gets to leave and come back
later when they’re ready to sleep.

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:15.489
Another piece of advice, is that couples use
separate blankets if one of the partners is

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:17.520
a particularly restless sleeper.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.659
Whatever you decide to do, you can now rest
easy knowing that sleepovers are doing your

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:22.659
body good.

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:26.400
What are your thoughts on this - and do you
tend to sleep better or worse, with a partner?

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.680
