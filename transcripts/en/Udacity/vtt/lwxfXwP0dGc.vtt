00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.240
The answer to this question is base pairing.

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.640
In the same way that nitrogeneous bases of DNA

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.610
compare with one another, and knowing one strand

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:13.000
down here, can tell you information about the other

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.240
strand. Again, it's easier to see with the

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.350
letters here. RNA also has nitrogenous bases that compare

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:22.520
and this is going to allow for information to

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.050
be mirrored just like it can be in DNA.
