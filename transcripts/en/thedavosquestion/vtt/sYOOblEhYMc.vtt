00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
&gt;&gt; I think that the most important innovation,
development that is

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.950
likely to impact on the state of the world
in the coming decades is the

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:16.260
fact that we have an increasing capacity in
poor countries to come up

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.840
with innovations.
Because up to now innovations have been done

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:26.150
mainly in rich countries.
And they have assumed a rich country context.

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:31.270
So you have television changer which assumes
you have already a

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:34.340
television.
You had an Internet solution that assumes

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.810
you already have broadband
access or a computer.

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:43.760
So innovations in rich countries have trouble
moving towards poor

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.650
countries because the context that they assume
is not there.

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.290
But as you have more and more of the capacity
to innovate in poor

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:57.430
countries in China, in India, in Latin Americas,
more and more products

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:02.500
are being designed taking the reality of the
customer, of those

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.980
customers to heart.
So, for example, since the Middle Ages, banks

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:13.100
were invented.
Banks are around for 700 years.

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:20.440
Banks only service about 30 percent of people.
Only about 30 percent of humans are in the

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.870
banking system.
Cell phones are covering more or less over

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:28.820
70 percent of the adult
population of the world.

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:36.930
Well, if we can tag onto the cell phone things
that are currently being

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.730
distributed or sold through banking systems
in countries that don't

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:43.650
have that penetration of the banking system,
we will incorporate a ton

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.300
of people to finance.
We will incorporate a ton of people to access

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.560
to medical knowledge that
they wouldn't otherwise have because now they

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.590
are connected.
But the people who are going to be thinking

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.430
about those innovations who
are going to be thinking about or coming up

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:03.620
with those ideas are people
in poorer countries who have those poor citizens

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:07.360
as their main concern
as their main goal and they're taking into

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:13.110
account the reality.
So innovation, as innovation spreads to poorer

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:19.000
countries solutions are
going to be more adequate for the poor.
