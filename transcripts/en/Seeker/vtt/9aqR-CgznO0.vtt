00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:04.410
This episode of DNews is brought to you by
“How We Got To Now” with Steven Johnson

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.420
- Tune in Wednesday October 22 at 9/8c on
PBS.

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.870
Can the season you were born in actually affect
your personality?

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:20.540
A new study says yes!

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:24.280
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and we’ve
done a few episodes before on things like

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:28.510
birth order, and how it affects your personality
- but what about the time of year you were

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:29.510
born?

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.909
It sounds kinda like pseudo-astrology - but
according to a new study, the particular season

00:00:33.909 --> 00:00:39.160
you were born in can have a significant impact
on your risk of developing mood disorders.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.120
Previous biochemical studies have effectively
demonstrated that your birth season has an

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.260
effect on certain neurotransmitters - specifically,
dopamine and serotonin - and those effects

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.879
continue to be detectable throughout your
adult life.

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.280
So armed with that information, a team of
researchers from Hungary decided to look at

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.359
400 subjects, and match their birth season
to their personality types later in life.

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.129
Sure enough, they noticed some interesting
and statistically significant trends:

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.969
People who are born in the winter, for example,
tend to be less irritable than those born

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:10.270
in other seasons.

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.180
But they’re also more prone to depressive
temperaments, than adults who were born in

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.180
autumn.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.439
People with hyperthymic temperaments – which
is a tendency to be excessively positive - were

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.450
also significantly higher in people born during
spring and summer.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:29.220
Yet summer births are more likely to experience
rapid frequent mood swings that waver between

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.620
sad and cheerful.

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:34.910
Now obviously, being irritable or depressive
doesn’t necessarily indicate that something’s

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:39.920
medically wrong with you - but consistent
negative temperaments can lead to mood disorders

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:40.920
over time.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.479
The next step is figuring out whether there
ARE distinct genetic markers related to someone’s

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.170
birth season and their risk of developing
a mood disorder.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.009
For now, though - researchers say their most
intriguing finding - was that people born

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:55.460
in the summer tend to be the most excessively
positive of the bunch.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.240
Of course, every study has its outliers - and
this was by no means an enormous sample size

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.390
of people.

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.399
Still though, what would you guys say about
this?

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:06.249
Does your birth season match up with what’s
presented here?

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:08.180
Feel free to let us know in the comments below.

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:09.580
Otherwise, thanks for watching!
