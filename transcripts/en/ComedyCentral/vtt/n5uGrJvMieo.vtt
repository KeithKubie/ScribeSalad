00:01:18.444 --> 00:01:21.747 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon:  LET ME ASK YOU
THIS.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.851 line:85%
ARE WE GOING TO LIVE ON MARS?

00:01:24.884 --> 00:01:26.986 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; AS FAR AS I CAN TELL NO TIME
SOON.

00:01:27.019 --> 00:01:28.187 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon:  NO TIME SOON.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.223 line:91%
&gt;&gt; YEAH, BECAUSE MARS IS-- YOU
KNOW, PEOPLE WANT TO GO THERE

00:01:30.256 --> 00:01:32.091 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND HANG OUT --
&gt;&gt; Jon: RIGHT. RIGHT.

00:01:32.124 --> 00:01:34.193 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; AND YOU HAVE TO
REMIND THEM THAT, LIKE, YOU

00:01:34.226 --> 00:01:37.196 line:85%
CAN'T BREATHE THE AIR. RIGHT?

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.397 size:88% position:44% line:91%
LITTLE-- LITTLE FACTS -- YOU
KNOW, THE PILGRIMS CAME FROM

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.967 align:start position:0% line:91%
EUROPE TO THE NEW WORLD.
&gt;&gt; Jon: YES.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.937 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WHEN THEY GOT OFF THE
"MAYFLOWER" THEY COULD BREATHE

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.908 align:start position:0% line:85%
THE AIR. RIGHT?

00:01:48.941 --> 00:01:49.976 align:start position:0% line:91%
LIKE THE TREES-- THE TREES IN
THE NEW WORLD WERE MADE OF WOOD,

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:50.977 align:start size:97% position:3% line:91%
JUST LIKE THE TREES THEY BUILT
THEIR SHIPS WITH.

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:52.845 line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon: YES.

00:01:52.878 --> 00:01:54.981 line:91%
&gt;&gt; SO THEY COULD REPAIR THEIR
SHIPS AND PEOPLE WERE THERE TO

00:01:55.014 --> 00:01:56.215 size:88% position:44% line:85%
GREET THEM IN THE NEW WORLD.

00:01:56.248 --> 00:01:56.983 align:start position:0% line:85%
IF I GO TO MARS-- NO.

00:01:57.016 --> 00:01:59.452 align:start position:0% line:85%
NO.

00:01:59.485 --> 00:02:02.088 size:84% position:42% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon:  YOU CAN'T BREATHE.

00:02:02.121 --> 00:02:02.822 size:78% position:39% line:85%
&gt;&gt; NO, YOU CAN'T BREATHE.

00:02:02.855 --> 00:02:05.324 size:84% position:42% line:85%
YOU CAN'T REPAIR YOUR SHIP.

00:02:05.357 --> 00:02:06.359 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: THE, THE -- SO WHAT--
WHAT-- WHAT HAS LIT A

00:02:06.392 --> 00:02:10.062 align:start position:0% line:91%
FIRE FOR YOU SCIENTIFICALLY
RIGHT NOW?

00:02:10.095 --> 00:02:12.632 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU ALWAYS HAVE A LITTLE
SOMETHING IN YOUR POCKET THAT

00:02:12.665 --> 00:02:14.600 align:start position:0% line:91%
GIVES YOU THE PASSION, THE
SPARK.

00:02:14.633 --> 00:02:16.969 line:91%
WHAT IS IT IN THE SCIENCE WORLD
RIGHT NOW THAT'S GOT YOU THERE?

00:02:17.002 --> 00:02:21.040 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I'VE GOT TO SAY IT'S NOT EVEN
ABOUT SCIENCE.

00:02:21.073 --> 00:02:23.109 align:start position:0% line:91%
IT'S-- IT'S THE WARMTH-- THE
RISE OF THE WARMTH THAT I SEE IN

00:02:23.142 --> 00:02:24.177 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE PUBLIC FOR LEARNING ABOUT
SCIENCE.

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:25.311 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon:  OH, REALLY?

00:02:25.344 --> 00:02:26.179 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; AND THE EXCITEMENT THAT
BRINGS.

00:02:26.212 --> 00:02:27.380 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU FEEL THE
DIFFERENCE?

00:02:27.413 --> 00:02:28.381 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; I FEEL. IT.

00:02:28.414 --> 00:02:29.015 align:start position:0% line:85%
OH MAN.

00:02:29.048 --> 00:02:29.815 align:start position:0% line:85%
OH

00:02:29.848 --> 00:02:31.184 size:88% position:44% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon:  THAT'S INTERESTING.

00:02:31.217 --> 00:02:32.252 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS.

00:02:32.285 --> 00:02:35.988 align:start position:0% line:91%
IT'S NOT JUST THIS IS SCIENCE,
LET ME LEARN ABOUT IT.

00:02:36.021 --> 00:02:37.256 line:91%
IT'S THAT THERE IS A CULTURE
THAT THINKS ABOUT SCIENCE AND

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:38.824 align:start position:0% line:91%
LIKES SCIENCE --
&gt;&gt; Jon: RIGHT.

00:02:38.857 --> 00:02:40.293 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THAT IS RISING
UP IN THIS COUNTRY.

00:02:40.326 --> 00:02:44.096 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon:  RIGHT.

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:44.997 line:91%
&gt;&gt; AND IT'S EXEMPLIFIED BY --
LIKE THE GEEKOSPHERE LED THAT.

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.632 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: RIGHT. NOW IS GEEK, IS
GEEK A WORD?

00:02:46.665 --> 00:02:49.769 align:start position:0% line:91%
IS THAT SOMETHING I CAN USE OR
ONLY YOU GUYS CAN USE?

00:02:49.802 --> 00:02:51.270 size:81% position:41% line:85%
IS THAT -- HOW DOES THAT--

00:02:51.303 --> 00:02:52.338 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WELL, I'LL TELL
YOU. IN THE OLD DAYS --

00:02:52.371 --> 00:02:53.606 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon: YEAH.

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:54.207 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I'M OLD ENOUGH TO
REMEMBER THE OLD DAYS.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.041 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon: YEAH.

00:02:55.074 --> 00:02:55.441 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; IF YOU WERE A GEEK IN HIGH
SCHOOL.

00:02:55.475 --> 00:02:57.176 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon: YEAH.

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:58.444 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YOU WERE THE ONE WHO
GOT THE WEDGY BY THE

00:02:58.477 --> 00:02:59.579 align:start position:0% line:91%
FOOTBALL QUARTERBACK.
&gt;&gt; Jon: RIGHT.

00:02:59.612 --> 00:03:00.213 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; YOU WERE THE ONE
WHO WERE EXPLOITED --

00:03:00.246 --> 00:03:01.547 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon: RIGHT.

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.751 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; CALLED YOU FOUR-EYES,
OR WHATEVER IT IS.

00:03:05.784 --> 00:03:06.819 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND THEN THE QUARTERBACK LEARNED
THAT THEY NEEDED YOU --

00:03:06.852 --> 00:03:11.257 line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon: RIGHT.

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:12.124 size:78% position:39% line:85%
&gt;&gt; TO FIX THEIR COMPUTER.

00:03:12.158 --> 00:03:13.759 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND THEN THE STOCK VALUE OF
GEEKS ROSE.

00:03:13.792 --> 00:03:16.796 line:91%
THE RICHEST PERSON IN THE WORLD
IS THE PATRON SAINT OF NERDS,

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:20.066 align:start position:0% line:85%
BILL GATES.

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:26.839 align:start position:0% line:91%
SO THE WORLD IS DIFFERENT
BECAUSE OF THIS.

00:03:26.872 --> 00:03:27.740 align:start position:0% line:91%
BECAUSE WE ONLY ENTER THE FUTURE
ON THE INTELLECTUAL CAPITAL

00:03:27.773 --> 00:03:30.009 align:start position:0% line:91%
BROUGHT TO THIS WORLD BY THE
GEEK-O-SPHERE.

00:03:30.042 --> 00:03:31.277 align:start position:0% line:85%
( APPLAUSE )

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:32.545 align:start position:0% line:91%
LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION.
&gt;&gt; WHAT'S THAT?

00:03:32.578 --> 00:03:33.879 line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: AND I WANT TO GET YOUR
TAKE ON THIS BECAUSE, OBVIOUSLY,

00:03:33.912 --> 00:03:35.214 align:start position:0% line:85%
YOU'RE A LEARNED MAN.

00:03:35.247 --> 00:03:36.215 align:start position:0% line:85%
YOU'RE AN EDUCATED MAN.

00:03:36.248 --> 00:03:40.186 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU'RE A MAN DEALS IN FACT AND
REALITY.

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:42.188 align:start position:0% line:85%
SUPERMAN VERSUS BATMAN.

00:03:42.221 --> 00:03:44.757 align:start position:0% line:91%
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
YOU KNOW, SO THERE'S BEEN SOME

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.226 align:start position:0% line:91%
DISCUSSION IN THE AUDIENCE --
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:49.862 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: ABOUT WHO WOULD WIN,
SUPERMAN VERSUS BATMAN.

00:03:49.895 --> 00:03:52.031 align:start position:0% line:91%
WHO WOULD WIN, SUPERMAN
VERSUS BATMAN?

00:03:52.064 --> 00:03:53.299 line:91%
PERSONALLY, I DON'T EVEN HAVE A
QUESTION-- BATMAN'S JUST A GUY

00:03:53.332 --> 00:03:55.101 align:start position:0% line:85%
WITH A NICE BELT.

00:03:55.134 --> 00:03:56.068 align:start position:0% line:85%
SUPERMAN IS INVINCIBLE.

00:03:56.101 --> 00:03:57.937 align:start position:0% line:91%
HE IS FASTER THAN A SPEEDING
BULLET.

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.106 align:start position:0% line:85%
HE CAN FLY.

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:02.108 size:78% position:39% line:91%
HE CAN -- I JUST, I DON'T
EVEN SEE IT AS A CONTEST.

00:04:02.141 --> 00:04:03.209 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I WOULD TELL YOU WHAT
IT'S ABOUT.

00:04:03.242 --> 00:04:08.447 align:start position:0% line:85%
I WOULD TELL YOU. 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:09.281 align:start position:0% line:85%
I WOULD TELL YOU. OKAY?

00:04:09.314 --> 00:04:10.016 align:start position:0% line:91%
WHO DOES BATMAN REPORT TO?
THE MAYOR --

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:11.417 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon:  COMMISSIONER
GORDON.

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:12.551 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YEAH, YEAH. THE
COMMISSIONER --

00:04:12.584 --> 00:04:13.452 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE POLICE COMMISSIONER AND
ULTIMATELY THE MAYOR.

00:04:13.485 --> 00:04:15.354 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon: YEAH.

00:04:15.387 --> 00:04:16.522 line:85%
&gt;&gt; WHO DOES SUPERMAN REPORT TO?

00:04:16.555 --> 00:04:18.324 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon:  THE GUY IN THE ICE
CASTLE.

00:04:18.357 --> 00:04:21.861 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YEAH, YEAH, RIGHT. SO IT'S NO
ONE WE KNOW.

00:04:21.894 --> 00:04:24.196 align:start position:0% line:91%
IT'S NO ONE WE HAVE ANY INSIGHT
INTO.

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:25.197 line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon: EXACTLY.

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.998 align:start size:97% position:3% line:91%
&gt;&gt; HE JUST BEHAVES IN WHATEVER
WAY HE WANTS.

00:04:26.031 --> 00:04:29.001 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon:  YES.

00:04:29.034 --> 00:04:33.139 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; SO AT THE END OF THE DAY WHAT
MIGHT MATTER IS THE PUBLIC

00:04:33.172 --> 00:04:39.578 align:start position:0% line:91%
RECEPTION OF THE SUPERHERO AND
SUPERHERO'S CONDUCT.

00:04:39.611 --> 00:04:41.580 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND IF BATMAN EXECUTES OUR
WISHES IN THE CITY AND SUPERMAN

00:04:41.613 --> 00:04:43.749 align:start position:0% line:91%
DOES WHAT THE HELL HE WANTS,
THAT'S-- THAT-- THAT'S A

00:04:43.782 --> 00:04:47.787 align:start position:0% line:85%
CONFLICT. 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:52.525 line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU CANNOT BE A
GUY IN A LEOTARD AND NOT

00:04:52.558 --> 00:04:54.794
-- AND JUST BE HUMAN.

00:04:54.827 --> 00:04:55.795 align:start position:0% line:91%
LIKE SUPERMAN CAN GET AWAY WITH
IT CAUSE HE'S SUPERMAN.

00:04:55.828 --> 00:04:57.963 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; AND THESE ARE BLUE LEOTARDS,
YEAH, PANTYHOSE,

00:04:57.996 --> 00:05:01.300 align:start size:88% position:13% line:91%
WHATEVER HE'S WEARING --
( LAUGHTER )

00:05:01.333 --> 00:05:04.570 line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: THAT'S RIGHT. BUT IRON
MAN I THINK FIGURED SOMETHING

00:05:04.603 --> 00:05:08.307 align:start position:0% line:91%
OUT, WHICH IS THAT I SHOULD WEAR
IRON AND NOT A LEOTARD.

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:08.907 align:start position:0% line:91%
( LAUGHTER )
&gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT -- BASIC FACTS.

00:05:08.941 --> 00:05:11.410 size:81% position:41% line:85%
&gt;&gt; WHEN IS "STAR TALK" ON?

00:05:11.443 --> 00:05:12.277 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; OH, THANKS.

00:05:12.311 --> 00:05:13.312 align:start position:0% line:91%
IT'S-- IT JUMPED SPECIES TO
TELEVISION.

00:05:13.345 --> 00:05:14.213 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon:  IT DID.

00:05:14.246 --> 00:05:15.281 align:start position:0% line:91%
IT WAS ON THE RADIO. IT WAS A
RADIO SHOW.

00:05:15.314 --> 00:05:16.182 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; AND DID YOU KNOW, HE WAS ON
AN ORIGINAL EPISODE OF

00:05:16.215 --> 00:05:17.616 align:start position:0%
"STAR TALK."

00:05:17.649 --> 00:05:18.717 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: THE ORIGINAL "STAR
TALK."

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:19.952 size:84% position:42% line:91%
&gt;&gt; AND I FOUND OUT, THAT'S
WHEN I FOUND OUT HE MAJORED

00:05:19.985 --> 00:05:22.455 align:start position:0% line:91%
IN CHEMISTRY IN COLLEGE AND THEN
I ASKED THE GEEK QUESTION

00:05:22.488 --> 00:05:23.589 line:85%
WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE ELEMENT?

00:05:23.622 --> 00:05:24.857 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND HE SAYS I HAVE A FAVORITE
ELEMENT.

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:25.758 line:91%
I HAD A POSTER OF IT ON MY WALL.
&gt;&gt; Jon: WHAT'S UP? WHAT'S UP?

00:05:25.791 --> 00:05:27.126 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; IT'S CARBON.
&gt;&gt; Jon: BOOM.

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:29.829 line:91%
&gt;&gt; AND I SAID WHY IS IT CARBON,
AND HE SAID, BECAUSE HE KNEW

00:05:29.862 --> 00:05:34.367 line:91%
THAT CARBON COMBINES WITH ALL
OTHER ELEMENTS ON THE TABLE.

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.770 line:91%
AND HE SAID CARBON IS LIKE THE
SLUT OF THE PERIODIC TABLE OF

00:05:37.803 --> 00:05:38.938 align:start position:0% line:85%
ELEMENTS. THAT'S IT!

00:05:38.971 --> 00:05:41.841 align:start position:0% line:91%
( LAUGHTER )
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )

00:05:41.874 --> 00:05:44.677 line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon: BONDED WITH EVERYBODY.

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:45.411 align:start position:0% line:91%
CARBON IS ALWAYS LIKE-- OH,
SNAP.

00:05:45.444 --> 00:05:46.412 align:start position:0% line:85%
WHAT IS THAT, OXYGEN?

00:05:46.445 --> 00:05:49.682 line:85%
GIVE ME TWO OF THOSE BAD BOYS.

00:05:49.715 --> 00:05:51.584 size:84% position:42% line:91%

00:05:55.254 --> 00:05:56.655 align:start position:0% line:85%
YEAH.

00:05:56.688 --> 00:05:59.392 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon:  I'M GOING TO ESTER THAT

00:05:59.425 --> 00:06:01.761 align:start size:97% position:3% line:91%
&gt;&gt; SO, SO "STAR TALK" IS ABOUT
GETTING PEOPLE --

&gt;&gt; Jon: YEAH. YEAH.

00:06:02.795 --> 00:06:04.163 align:start size:94% position:6% line:91%
&gt;&gt; HEWN FROM POP
CULTURE SUCH AS YOURSELF --

00:06:04.196 --> 00:06:05.231 line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon: YEAH.

00:06:05.264 --> 00:06:07.600 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; AND EXPLORING ALL THE
WAYS SCIENCE HAS MATTERED IN

THEIR LIVES.

00:06:09.268 --> 00:06:12.938 line:91%
SO IT REVEALS THE FACT THAT
SCIENCE MANIFESTS EVEN IN OUR

00:06:12.971 --> 00:06:14.607 align:start position:0% line:91%
CHERISHED POP CULTURE
INSTITUTIONS.

&gt;&gt; Jon:  YOU KNOW WHAT I
LOVE ABOUT THAT?

00:06:16.074 --> 00:06:19.979 align:start position:0% line:91%
