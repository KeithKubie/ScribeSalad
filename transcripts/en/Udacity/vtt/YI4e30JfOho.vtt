Okay, now that you've been through the material

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:04.570
for lesson three, I want to see if you can

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:06.340
complete the concept map that we showed at

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:08.850
the beginning of the lesson. Remember just fill in

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.450
the blanks with one of the words you see here from the word bank. If you filled

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.550
out the lesson map as we went along, you'll

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:17.130
probably find this a little bit easier. Good luck.
