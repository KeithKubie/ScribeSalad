00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:06.200
Hey guys. I'm Nate welcome back to the workshop

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.160
We've got a couple of chemicals that we've used at the past and today

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.200
We're going to combine them, and see how they work out

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.840
We've got liquid nitrogen, which we've done a lot of *cool* experiments with and here. We've got a tank of sulfur hexafluoride

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:19.980
In case you don't remember

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.260
[DEEP VOICE]: Sulf

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.860
Sulfur hexachloride has the opposite effect of helium on your voice if you breathe it in

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.120
pretty cool [BREATHES OUT]

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.219
[NORMAL VOICE]: Of course you want to make sure you don't keep the sulfur hexafluoride

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:41.070
In your lungs for too long because it's much heavier than air and will actually displace any air in your lungs

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.759
Which could make you lightheaded dizzy or even pass out

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.850
So today we're gonna see what happens if we fill a balloon with sulfur hexafluoride

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:54.389
And then put that into some liquid nitrogen cooling it down to over 300 degrees Fahrenheit below zero

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:02.579
Clearly a standard balloon when blown up will not fit into the mouth of this container

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.959
But I think we can squeeze it enough that it starts to fit in and I'm counting on the liquid nitrogen

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.839
Shrinking the volume of the gas think the whole thing will collapse down to the point where it can all fit inside this container

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.240
Let's give it a try!

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.240
[INFLATES BALLOON]

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.480
There we go whole balloon, a whole balloon full of sulfur hexafluoride

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:32.220
 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.060
Now I am going to try and do this without tying a knot in it because I might want to open the balloon after depending

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:44.130
On what it looks like has happened inside my tap overestimated. How well I could deform this balloon to fit it in the container

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.160
Since I can't really fit the balloon in I'm just gonna try and scoop some liquid nitrogen out and pour it over the balloon

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:51.840
See what we get

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:52.800
 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.169
The balloon is definitely shrinking, that's working well

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.810
There we go and

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:15.360
The neck of this is still very much twisted off. Nothing is escaping out of the balloon

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:21.060
It's just that the volume of the gas is getting much much smaller, and I believe it's turning solid

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.389
Let's take a quick break to learn about our sponsor audible.com

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.010
I'm a big fan of sci-fi and fantasy and recently I've been listening to opera by Brandon Sanderson

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.140
It's the 3rd book in a Stormlight archive

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.269

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.530
Now let's go back to our experiments

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.100
That is a balloon

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.250
full of solid

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.749
Sulfur hexafluoride a very very cold balloon full of solid sulfur hexafluoride

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.839
Let's let this warm back up and see if it's still full of sulfur hexafluoride gas way

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.160
We'd expect it to be there you go. That's a chunk of sulfur hexafluoride right there

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:24.049
Shaking around in the balloon the balloon itself is wearing back up, but the sulfur hexafluoride inside has not

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.250
Our balloon is still very cold

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.319
So it's getting frost on the outside. I'm trying to just keep wiping that off so we can see inside

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.690
And see the balloon is filling back up just gonna try and use the heat of my hand

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.549
To melt the sulfur hexafluoride I guess it's not gonna melt. It's gonna sublime

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:55.400
It's just making my hand really cold. Oh, yeah. It's definitely making my hand really cold

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.900
anywhere those little

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.320
Specks it for just a second really cools down the balloon a lot leaves marks on you can see maybe a little bit of vapor

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.880
Condensing on the bottom where it's sitting it's getting pretty close

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.590
I don't want to try breathing any of this gas in while they're still frozen

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.440
Particles in here because then it's possible

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:21.709
They could get blown out with the moving gas and have frozen particles of sulfur hexafluoride in my lungs

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:26.839
That sounds like a very bad experience to me. Oh I forget how heavy this stuff is this balloon is just like

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:33.200
Pulling down so hard. It feels like gravity is increased like you just as way more

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.139
Dropped to it than a normal balloon

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:39.389
Think we are

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:45.739
We gasps off' i'd all of our sulfur hexafluoride in this balloon that looks like about the size that it was before we started

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:50.839
So I think this is worked out pretty. Well. I'm gonna try breathing some of it in see if it still has the same effect

00:04:56.789 --> 00:05:04.729
Look at you think I think it says like it still has the exact same effect even have to be frozen and fan and

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.549
That really settles in your lungs it's still a little bit of air

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:13.400
There's one more experiment

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:18.410
I want to see if we can do I want to take another balloon shrink it all down so all the sulfur hexafluoride is solid

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:21.320
And I want to cut it out and then based on what I just did here

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.739
I want to see if I can compress it down in sort of all one pellet and

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.769
Then take that pellet can fit it inside a new balloon

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:35.600
And tie that off and let it expand and see if I can successfully transfer sulfur hexafluoride in solid state from one balloon into another

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.210
Why I don't know it just seems like

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:40.730
It'd be neat

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:49.490
Heavy balloon

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.590
There you go

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:07.310
solid sulfur hexafluoride right there

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:09.290
very very cold stuff

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:11.659
And it's a lot like solid carbon dioxide

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:19.429
usually known as dry ice it doesn't pass through a liquid phase at peace temperatures and pressures it goes straight from a solid into a

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:23.120
Gas you can see what's coming off of there is probably sulfur hexafluoride

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:28.549
Turning into gas it also might have a little bit of condensed water vapor in with it all right

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:32.660
And I think that's most of our sulfur hexafluoride of course. We've lost a little bit of it as it warmed up

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:37.190
I'm now trying to compress it down and that seems to be working all right. I think I've got kind of a good

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:43.430
Pellet of sulfur hexafluoride here, I'm just gonna take the chance and lick it. Well. I can easily hold on to it

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:50.930
Doesn't really seem to do much kind of like licking an ice cube

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:55.220
No flavor whatsoever all right now. Let's see if I can manage to

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:57.890
force this chunk of sulfur hexafluoride

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:01.279
Down into this balloon without it just completely freezing

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:04.820
There we go

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:07.739
that is a chunk of sulfur hexafluoride in the balloon I

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:10.500
Squeezed the air out as much as I could

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:16.320
once the sulfur hexafluoride is in there so now we can just watch you can see it's already starting to expand a little bit and

00:07:16.449 --> 00:07:18.869
Everything in there should just be sulfur hexafluoride

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:22.380
That's in there. I wonder if I can break that chunk back up

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:26.820
It's somewhat broken up

00:07:27.699 --> 00:07:30.839
And I kind of shake it and keep my hands on it to add some warmth

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:34.320
Try and blow that back up as much as it's gonna go

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:42.810
Here we have a demonstration of how fast our liquid nitrogen is expanding inside of our thermos kind of a lot

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:46.529
Currently the neck of the balloon is covering the only

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:49.350
exit from this container of liquid nitrogen

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:52.229
And so we can see about how much liquid nitrogen

00:07:52.389 --> 00:07:57.239
Is turning into a gas at any given time when you can see this balloon is growing at a decent rate

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:01.229
Alright our sulfur hexafluoride has now completely

00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:04.110
sublimated back into a gas

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:10.380
We have our heavy balloon you may notice this balloon is definitely smaller than the one we originally filled with sulfur hexafluoride

00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:12.000
for this particular experiment

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.940
And I'm sure that's just because we lost some of the sulfur hexafluoride as we were transferring it from one balloon to the other

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:26.669
Yeah go in there now let's cut the neck off. I'll breathe this in and see if it gives us the same effect

00:08:26.669 --> 00:08:28.669
We're used to a sulfur hexafluoride

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:45.529
What do you think sounds to me like it's still looking just the same even after being transferred from one balloon into another

00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:52.430
And then you gotta breathe it out, so you don't pass out that might be on here tight enough

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:55.999
And it doesn't want to pop itself off this might just not have enough pressure

00:08:56.699 --> 00:09:02.058
So we might just have our balloon explode, and I want to just step back for help minutes and let that do its thing

00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:12.769
It's getting kind of narrower down at the neck which might be

00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:16.430
Pulling it differently

00:09:16.439 --> 00:09:18.149
Whoa?

00:09:18.149 --> 00:09:20.628
That was a ringer Wow

00:09:21.209 --> 00:09:27.589
Well there you go a nice little mini experiment right now a balloon covering the nozzle of this tank it definitely

00:09:27.839 --> 00:09:30.498
Warms up enough to put out some vapors of liquid, nitrogen

00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:33.860
Enough pressure to burst a balloon and that only took maybe

00:09:35.189 --> 00:09:38.689
10-15 minutes total to blow up that whole balloon and then pop it

00:09:38.879 --> 00:09:40.759
Pretty fun stuff there we go now

00:09:40.759 --> 00:09:45.529
We know what happens if we put sulfur hexafluoride into a balloon and freeze it in liquid, nitrogen

00:09:45.839 --> 00:09:49.308
It doesn't actually go into a liquid phase at least in this pressure in the air

00:09:49.309 --> 00:09:54.049
It goes straight from the gas into a solid then it warms back up it turns back into a gas

00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:55.430
I thought it was especially fun

00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:58.459
We were able to take some of the solid hexafluoride out of the balloon

00:09:58.829 --> 00:10:02.179
Smoosh it down into sort of a pellet and fit it into another balloon

00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:07.699
Where it then warmed back up and inflated that balloon? It's an interesting way to transfer sulfur hexafluoride

00:10:08.309 --> 00:10:12.199
Probably not very practical for most means, but I thought it was cool that it works

00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:19.550
