00:00:05.167 --> 00:00:07.514
If I could meet me when I was 16,

00:00:07.514 --> 00:00:10.446
I think the first thing that I would say

00:00:10.446 --> 00:00:15.948
is that it is so tempting to do something

00:00:15.948 --> 00:00:18.085
for somebody to get them to like you.

00:00:19.144 --> 00:00:21.173
Don't.

00:00:21.173 --> 00:00:24.218
Really be mindful that you are so wise right now

00:00:24.218 --> 00:00:26.758
because of all the things that you don't know.

00:00:26.758 --> 00:00:29.614
So just, really before somebody

00:00:29.614 --> 00:00:31.882
asks you to do something,

00:00:31.882 --> 00:00:33.950
really take time to think about

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.554
whether or not it's going to be good for you,

00:00:36.554 --> 00:00:38.757
that if, after you do it, you're going to go,

00:00:38.757 --> 00:00:40.173
"Oh, I'm so glad I did that!

00:00:40.173 --> 00:00:41.241
That was so good for me,

00:00:41.241 --> 00:00:43.387
that was so wonderful."

00:00:43.387 --> 00:00:45.911
You know, whether that's, whatever it is,

00:00:45.911 --> 00:00:46.912
whether it's eating something,

00:00:46.912 --> 00:00:47.581
drinking something,

00:00:47.581 --> 00:00:48.515
being with somebody,

00:00:48.515 --> 00:00:49.246
taking a job,

00:00:49.246 --> 00:00:49.989
whatever it is,

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:53.408
just really check into the wisdom

00:00:53.408 --> 00:00:55.309
that you already have

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:57.569
to see how you're going to feel after you to do it.

00:00:57.569 --> 00:00:59.390
That's the first thing.

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:00.919
And the second thing,

00:01:00.919 --> 00:01:01.798
I think there's loads,

00:01:01.798 --> 00:01:06.075
but the second thing is jealousy.

00:01:06.075 --> 00:01:11.540
Jealousy is a wonderful engine.

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.688
When you have it,

00:01:13.688 --> 00:01:17.063
really, really take it in

00:01:17.063 --> 00:01:18.599
and ask yourself,

00:01:18.599 --> 00:01:21.624
"Ooh, I'm really jealous of so-and-so.

00:01:21.624 --> 00:01:23.135
What is it I'm jealous about?

00:01:23.135 --> 00:01:27.960
What is it that they have that I want?"

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.010
And then trust that you already have it

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:32.213
and act as if you do,

00:01:32.213 --> 00:01:33.343
and if you don't,

00:01:33.343 --> 00:01:34.037
if you really feel,

00:01:34.037 --> 00:01:38.302
"Ooh, I don't have that thing or that attribute,"

00:01:38.302 --> 00:01:42.674
then trust that somewhere you have some quality

00:01:42.674 --> 00:01:45.892
that resembles that and let it grow in you.
