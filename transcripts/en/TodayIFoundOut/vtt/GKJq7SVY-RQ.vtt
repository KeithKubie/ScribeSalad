00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:36.160
During World War II, Nazi engineers designed
and built a number of revolutionary super

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:43.030
or “wonder weapons” (wunderwaffe), including
a wide array of aircraft, guns and ships.

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:49.140
Among these weapons is a mysterious small,
round tank named the Kugelpanzer (literally

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.339
meaning “spherical tank”).

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:55.430
This odd little tank was never seen in the
European theater, and very little is definitively

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.649
known about its purpose.

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:02.030
What is known is that it was made in Germany
and shipped to Japan, and then later captured

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.111
by the Soviets in 1945, probably in Manchuria.

00:01:06.111 --> 00:01:10.110
Today, the only one known to exist can be
found in the Kubinka Tank Museum in the Odintsovsky

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.400
District, Moscow Oblast, Russia.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:18.220
Powered by a single cylinder, two-stroke engine,
Kugelpanzer has a slit in the front (presumably

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:24.030
a driver’s view port), and a small arm and
wheel in the rear (perhaps for stability and/or

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.030
maneuvering).

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.570
Its hull is only 5 mm (.2 in.)

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:34.240
thick, and it isn’t fully clear what type
of metal comprises its armor (no metal samples

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.090
are currently allowed to be taken from it).

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:42.250
Popular theories of its purpose include reconnaissance,
as a mobile observation post for managing

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:47.640
artillery fire, and as a cable-laying vehicle;
however, there is little evidence to support

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.950
any of these hypotheses, since there has never
been any documentation found that explains

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.860
the vehicle or its design.

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:00.530
Given the dearth of evidence, as you would
expect, speculation is rampant, and one intriguing

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.580
theory even posits that it was commissioned
by the Japanese as part of their kamikaze

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.960
strategy of suicide missions.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.480
By August 1944, the ailing Japanese military
had been at war in the Pacific for 7 long

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.659
years, beginning with the Second Sino-Japanese
War in 1937.

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:21.840
During this period, rather than being captured,
and wanting to get in one last lick, some

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.099
Japanese pilots had begun the practice of
crashing their mostly disabled planes into

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:29.310
enemy positions (and killing themselves in
the process).

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.260
Through most of the Pacific War, this was
an informal, voluntary act; however, as the

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.500
war was winding down, the desperate Japanese
command (who were running out of qualified

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.060
pilots and whose aircraft at this point in
the war were outdated) decided that they would

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:48.230
get the most out of their unskilled personnel
and obsolete machinery by incorporating planned

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.120
suicide missions into their battle strategies.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.799
As such, in the fall of 1944, Japanese forces
began a series of kamikaze strikes.

00:02:55.799 --> 00:03:01.769
(Click here for more on the origin of the
kamikaze and how pilots were chosen for this

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:02.769
duty.)

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:07.160
In addition to improvised devices, such as
simply strapping bombs onto existing aircraft,

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.109
the Japanese military began manufacturing
specialized equipment.

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:15.739
These included the aircraft Ohka (“cherry
blossom”), as well as suicide boats, such

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:18.150
as Shinyo (“sea quake”).

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.349
Even tiny submarines were made, including
a modified torpedo named Kaiten (“returning

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:26.659
to heaven,”) and Kairyu (“sea dragon”),
a two-manned craft.

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:30.680
Given this mindset of many Japanese military
leaders, it has been theorized by some that

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:36.459
the Kugelpanzer was a part of this plan, with
a few key points often put forth to support

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:37.459
this theory.

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:41.760
First, like all of the other suicide machines,
it was small and designed to be operated with

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:47.319
a limited (1-2 man) crew; second, it wasn’t
equipped with any apparent offensive weaponry,

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:51.010
though it has been speculated that it was
meant to have a machine gun mounted in the

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:56.079
front; and third, its hull was rather flimsy
(5 mm thick) when compared to that of other

00:03:56.079 --> 00:04:00.099
armored vehicles, but on par with that of
at least one other suicide craft.

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:04.510
For instance, the Type 97 Chi-Ha, said to
be the “most widely produced Japanese medium

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:10.330
tank of World War II,” had 26 mm thick armor
on the sides of the turret and 33 mm thick

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:11.549
armor on its gun shield.

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:16.280
On the other hand, the Long Lance torpedo
from which the Kaiten manned torpedo was developed

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.650
had a comparably thin shell at 3.2 mm (.13
in.)

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.970
thick – much closer to the width of the
Kugelpanzer outer housing, than the strong

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:23.970
armor of the Type 97 tank.

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.880
For further reference, the thickness of a
common World War II helmet (the M1) was at

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:35.180
.035 to .037 inches (just under 1 mm), sufficient
to (at least sometimes) stop a .45 caliber

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:36.180
bullet.

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.060
So, essentially, the 5 mm thick walls of the
tank would have been sturdy enough to relatively

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:44.690
reliably stop many types of enemy bullets
from getting in, but thin enough to give way

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:46.919
easily from a blast within, to do maximum
damage.

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:48.900
At least, so this particularly theory goes.

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:53.160
Whatever its intended use, the Kugelpanzer
certainly has gone down as one of the more

00:04:53.160 --> 00:10:57.569
unique weapons developed during WWII.
