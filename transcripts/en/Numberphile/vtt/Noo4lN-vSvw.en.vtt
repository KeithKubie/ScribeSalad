00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.320
You have four 4s: 4 ,4 ,4 and 4,

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:07.880
and using all four 4s

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:11.900
you have to create, using the mathematical operators,

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.140
as many numbers as you can.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.640
So, the way that we start this normally, if we're

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.520
doing "level 1" four 4s, will be,

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.800
all that you're allowed to use is, addition, subtraction,

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.200
multiplication and division.

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:28.000
Let's start at 0, and we gonna then go to 1, then go to 2.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.520
So, with 0, how do you get four 4s to equal 0?

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:32.800
It is kind of easy.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.980
You can go 4 minus 4 plus 4 minus 4. That's 0.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.000
Brilliant! We've got 0.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.520
Okay, let's put the four 4s again to equal 1.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.120
Well, we could do 4 divided by 4, now that's 1,

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.620
plus 4 minus 4, or we could have done

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:56.900
4 divided by 4, divided by 4 divided by 4 which is 1 divided by 1, which is 1.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.280
Again that's 1. There are lots of different ways,

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.840
and they get a little bit more complicated.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.180
And we can go and do 2. And we can

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.700
carry on upwards.

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.740
How far? Ten? A hundred? A thousand?

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.300
I'm going to show you today,

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.060
Brady, your mind will be blown!

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.260
I will prove the four 4s all the way up to

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:18.540
infinity.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.800
[Brady]: You can make every number?

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.480
You can make EVERY number up to infinity.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.880
It's a fantastic little proof and we're

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.520
going to get there. We need to actually be,

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.700
we need to clarify the operators first.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.600
We can get up to 10 just with these:

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.660
plus, minus, multiplication and division.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.200
To get up to 20, we need to introduce

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.200
some other things: what we need to

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.620
introduce is concatenation,

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.180
which means that just that we've got 4 4 4 4, we can

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.140
bring them together, so we can actually

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.060
bring them together and consider that, say forty-four.

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:03.100
We introduce the decimal point so one of these could be zero point four.

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:09.240
And we introduce the factorial, which means it's 4 times 3 times 2 times 1.

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.940
And also, we need the square root,

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.940
so square root of 4 is obviously 2.

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.680
You might think, well, that's spoiling this other

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.300
little beautiful simple puzzle, but

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:21.860
actually factorial, concatenation,

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.340
decimal, and square root are really basic.

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.360
They're kind of in our basic armory.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.640
so I think that's fine. Well, how far can we do

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.800
with all of these? We can definitely get

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.880
up all the way to 50. Higher than 50?

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.200
We can get up pretty high, we can get up to 100,

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.500
but in fact we need to start introducing other ones, and

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.800
I'll show you-- one of the ones that doesn't work

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.120
with all these, is, say, 99.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.100
I'm gonna show you how to do 99.

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.880
So 99, there are different ways to do this, but this

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.640
is the one that I quite like. It all depends

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.860
which is the new symbol you're going to do.

00:02:53.860 --> 00:03:00.580
4 over 4, as a percentage is 100

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.320
minus 1 is 99.

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.380
So that's quite a clever way

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.040
and the good fun thing about the four 4s

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.680
well, just say you're bored on a

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.120
plane or a train, you can just start at

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.040
the beginning and then just go up and

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.680
if you've got a long haul flight

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.020
you might be able to get to 500 or something.

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:19.500
Some purists might disagree

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.020
and say this is really ugly and prefer

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:22.960
something else. Some people introduce

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.600
things like "the triangle number of" or

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.960
there's lots of combinatorial symbols that you can do,

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.960
you know, "4 choose 4" or

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.400
"4 factorial choose 4."

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.200
But already, with the operations that I've mentioned here,

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.680
where we have pretty much everything we need.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.240
The only other one that we need to get

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.600
up to infinity is log, and log is a

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.260
pretty simple thing, mathematically speaking.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.320
Brady: "Do you mean log ten, the natural log

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.080
or all different types of log?"

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.960
We're going to get there because actually the

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:55.820
log that we need is log base 4.

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:57.180
Brady: "Of course."

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:58.900
Of course, it had to be 4.

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.220
And we're also going to use log base half.

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.020
This is your brief refresher on what a log is, okay?

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:08.040
So, if a equals b to the c, then

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:13.260
the log base b of a equals c.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:14.880
So that's basically the same thing.

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.840
Let's put some numbers in, because we're

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.660
gonna be doing log 4, so 4 is equal to

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:25.840
4 to the 1, okay? Because 4 to the 1 is 4.

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:32.620
So the log base 4 of 4 is 1.

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.360
16 is 4 squared,

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:40.060
so the log base 4 of 16 equals 2.

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.420
64 equals 4 cubed,

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:46.340
so log base 4 of 64 equals 3.

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.280
Can you see there's a pattern here?

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:53.480
Basically, log base 4 of 4 to the n equals n.

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.340
n doesn't have to be a whole number

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:00.360
so the square root of n is the

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.240
same thing as n to the half.

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.600
Let's translate that here.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:13.100
We've got log the base 4 of the square root of 4

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:18.620
which is actually log base 4 of 4 to the half equals half.

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.419
And let's do the square root of the square root of n which is

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:25.780
the same thing as n to the half

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:29.800
times half, which is the same thing as n to the quarter.

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:35.220
We get log base four of square root of the square root of 4

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:40.920
equals log base 4 equals a quarter. I'm just gonna carry on because it's all over.

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:44.300
So the log of log of base 4 of the square root of the square of the square root of 4

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:49.680
equals log the base 4 of 4 to the 1/8 equals 1/8.

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.440
So, we are half the way there to proving the four 4s to infinity.

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.520
Because what we've actually done, we've got two 4s.

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.520
We know that this expression here,

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.740
we know log 4 of the square root of 4 is half.

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:05.260
Log 4 of the square root of the square root of 4 is a quarter.

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:08.520
So we know that just using two 4s we can

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:10.720
get the half the halfing sequence

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:13.180
which is half quarter eighth. So we've got two 4s left,

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:15.440
and let's see how we can get there.

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:18.300
Another bit of paper, and we're gonna do all on this next bit of paper.

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:21.900
We had log 4 of 4 to the n is n.

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:23.640
It's actually the same.

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:26.840
Whatever we have here that would be the same.

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:31.760
Log half half to the n equals n

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:32.860
Right?

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:35.400
And so let us now try to find the

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.620
log base half of these things here.

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:41.860
What I'm gonna do, the answer is always

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:47.220
log base half of half. That's 1.

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:51.880
Log base half of a quarter,

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:54.520
okay we've got two 4s to do that, is the same thing

00:06:54.520 --> 00:07:03.520
as log base half of half squared, which equals 2.

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:07.800
Log base half of an eighth

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:15.360
is log base half of half cubed, which equals 3.

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:26.240
So, we know that two 4s goes into here,

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.740
and in here and here. We just need to

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:33.820
find a way of expressing log base half

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:37.820
with two 4s. So we need to find a way of expressing half with two 4s,

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:41.780
that half is obviously 2 in 4

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:45.800
but that same thing is root 4 over 4.

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:48.080
So here, we can say that

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:59.000
log to the base root 4 over 4 of log 4 root 4 is 1.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.979
Because that is half, and

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:02.900
that is log of half, so that's 1

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:04.700
Brady: "So you used all four 4s then."

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:06.559
I've got all four 4s.

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:09.340
Earlier I showed you how you can use the four 4s to make 1

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:10.800
in a very very simple way.

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:13.699
Use 4 divided by 4, plus 4 or minus 4 is 1

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:16.300
But you can also do it here.

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:22.120
Log to the root 4 over 4 of log to the base 4 of root 4 is 1,

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:27.460
but log to the base 4 over 4 of log base 4

00:08:27.469 --> 00:08:32.180
of the square root of the square root of 4 equals 2.

00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:34.200
So this will expand out, and

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:36.980
Brady: "So however many square root signs you put there"

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:38.240
is equal to the number.

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:42.760
Brady: "so you could put, if you put a billion square root signs there, you'd get a billiion."

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:45.880
Yeah. If you have a bit of paper big enough to write,

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:49.460
log root 4 over 4 of log 4

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:51.620
the square root the square root the square root

00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:54.280
so much that you have a billion square root signs

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:56.320
of square root 4,

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:58.660
including everything there are a billion square root signs,

00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:00.199
that would equal a billion.

00:09:00.199 --> 00:09:03.470
The four 4s is a puzzle that was first written

00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:07.010
down in the late 19th century and you

00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:09.820
see very clearly in 1890s, there's a boom of this puzzle.

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:12.620
Then in like the 1930s, there's another boom.

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:15.500
Paul Dirac has a go at it. And Paul Dirac,

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:17.300
who famously loved mathematical puzzles,

00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:19.670
basically beats the puzzle, completely

00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:21.860
defeats the puzzle. Before it was considered how high

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:23.360
can you go, what are the operators that

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:25.610
you're going to need, and he just says, well,

00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:27.920
with just logs and a square root

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:29.139
I can bust this.

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:31.860
It's broken. I can solve it all the way to infinity.

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:38.180
Eccentricity of one, well actually, it's no longer an ellipse, then it's a parabola,

00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:44.720
and the shortest you can get is an eccentricity of zero. Eccentricity means away from the circle.
