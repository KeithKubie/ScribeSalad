00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:07.430
Do you believe in love at first sight or should
you restart this video until you find me attractive?

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:16.460
Hey loves, Julian here for DNews.

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.829
We all know that nauseating couple that just
won’t shut up about how they just met and

00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:23.410
BOOM, they found eternal joy and happiness.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:24.499
No one likes that couple.

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:27.369
If you don’t know that couple, you’re
that couple.

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:31.189
Part of the problem with this idea of love
at first sight is it sounds so implausible.

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:35.560
There’s 7 billion people out there and you
just glanced at someone and went, “Yep,

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:36.690
that’s the one forever?”

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.350
Well, guess what killjoys, love happens faster
than you think.

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.520
First of all let’s talk about love.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:43.520
What is love?

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:44.520
Baby don’t hurt me.

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.520
Don’t hurt me.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:46.520
No more, sorry, couldn’t resist.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:47.520
Anyway there’s a lot of different angles
to tackle the question from but for our sake

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.109
let’s just boil it down to chemicals in
your brain.

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:53.289
Feelings of desire, emotional connection and
bonding are facilitated by neurotransmitters

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:56.660
and hormones like dopamine, oxytocin, and
vasopressin.

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.840
So how long does it take for this brain cocktail
to start brewing?

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.129
Well back in 2010 Dr. Stephanie Ortigue, an
assistant professor of psychology and neurology

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.930
at the University of Syracuse, conducted a
meta-analysis of love research.

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.400
The study was published in the Journal of
Sexual Medicine.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.659
Ortigue and colleagues examined participants
in fMRI machines and found that 12 areas of

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:19.890
your brain can start lighting up and slinging
chemicals around within .2 seconds of slapping

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:20.890
eyes on someone.

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:22.329
“But hold on,” the cynic in you says.

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:25.050
“What if that’s just lust, not love?”

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:26.050
Good point.

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.189
And my response is, “Neurologically, what’s
the difference?”

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.780
Well Ortigue’s study tries to answer both
those questions.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.439
A lot of similar areas lit up for people who
had fallen in love compared to people who

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:39.659
had fallen in lust, so for her it came down
to whether they craved some sort of reward

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.659
right now, of if they thought more long term
and abstractly about it.

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:47.180
People in love showed increased activity in
areas associated with reward like the ventral

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.719
striatum, and parts of the brain associated
with emotion like the amygdala, hypothalamus,

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:53.650
and the inferior parietal lobule.

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.570
Ortigue interprets that to mean that love
is something that can grow out of lust, as

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.469
your brain adds complexity to a foundation
that was built around achieving simple pleasant

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:03.909
physical satisfaction.

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:07.720
So if you experienced lust at first sight
but now want to gush to your friends about

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.040
how you knew it was true love, you were close
enough already that I say go ahead and modify

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.290
history a little bit.

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.400
Actually according to Dr. Donna Jo Bridge
of Northwestern University, because we have

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.879
a tendency of inserting new information into
our memories, you’re probably doing that

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:22.879
already.

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:27.150
Love may or may not begin with a glance, but
it is undeniable that every kiss begins with

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.150
Kay.

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.380
Look at the spelling, it’s right there.

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.940
Kay Jewelers is one of our sponsors at Discovery
Digital, they help keep the lights on and

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:32.940

them and score bonus points with that special

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:33.940
someone, go ahead and check out Kay’s line

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:34.940
The brain is an amazing organ.

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.540
It starts firing in regular wave patterns
25 weeks after you’re conceived and keeps

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.150
working right up until the moment you fall
in love.

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.230
Alright it doesn’t stop but it starts changing
in some interesting ways.

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:54.360
Check out Trace’s piece on that right here,
you’re going to love it.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.349
So, love at first sight.

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:58.349
Do you believe in it?

00:02:58.349 --> 00:02:59.600
Have you experienced it?

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.280
