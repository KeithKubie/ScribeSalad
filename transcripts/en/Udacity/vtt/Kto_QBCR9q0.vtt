00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.790
Alright, so, one of the things that's very helpful about regression is

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:06.450
that in many ways it's very simple to visualize, it's very simple

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.570
to think about what some of the issues are and all the

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.460
various topics in machine learning that are really important to understand and

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.720
sometimes are difficult concepts really do come up in a fairly easy

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.070
to understand way. So what I'd like to do now is to

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.890
step through an example Of doing some regression and to point out

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.790
what some of the pitfalls are and how they're generally handled in

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:29.310
the machine learning context. So, this graph that I put

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.960
up here, is, we just made these numbers up, but it's

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.260
supposed to tell us a, a little bit about housing

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.000
prices. So let's imagine that we're off to buy a house

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.170
and What we notice is that there's lots of different

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.810
houses on the market, and there are lots of different, sizes,

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.749
right. So ,the square footage of the house can vary. And

00:00:48.749 --> 00:00:51.134
in this case the houses that I visited can be between,

00:00:51.134 --> 00:00:54.320
about 1,000 to 10,000 square feet. And of course, as

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.910
you get bigger houses, you tend to get more, the, the

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.420
prices tend to go up, too. Alright, so the price

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.400
that the house cost is, tends to rise with the size

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.420
of the house. So, what I've done here is I've

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.490
plotted as a little x say a set of nine houses

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.030
that I've observed. Start off over here with a house

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.790
that's a 1,000 square feet and cost a $1,000? I don't

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.740
know what year this happened in. And we end

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.790
up with a house that is 10,000 square feet

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.730
and cost about $6,000. Again, I don't. This is

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:27.610
not true in Providence Rhode Island, I'll tell you that.

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:28.520
&gt;&gt; Are you sure?

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.000
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.820
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's really not true in Atlanta Georgia.

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:39.070
&gt;&gt; So Alright... So, so, so imagine that this is the relationship we

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.500
observe. But now we want to answer a question like, Well, what happens

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.050
If we find a house on the market and it's about $5,000,

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.110
what do you think a fair price for that would be? So what

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:49.850
do you, what do you think, Charles? Looking at this, what do

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.750
you think a fair price for a 5,000 square foot house would be?

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.234
&gt;&gt; Apparently about $5,000.

00:01:55.234 --> 00:01:58.220
&gt;&gt; About, $5,000. Right. So, how did you do that?

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.090
&gt;&gt; I looked at the graph, I went over to 5,000 square

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:07.540
feet at the x-axis and I went up. Until I found ,where one

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.760
of the x's was on the y axis and I said, oh, that's about 5,000 square feet.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.760
&gt;&gt; Well, but there was no corresponding point for that,

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.800
so you had to interpolate or something ,uh, based on the

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.700
points that were there you had to kind of imagine what

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.580
might, might be happening at the 5,000 square foot mark, right?

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.670
&gt;&gt; That's true, although this one was a little easy because

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.820
at 4,000 and 6,000 square feet, they were almost exactly the same.

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:33.020
&gt;&gt; Mm, and so that, to you, made it feel like there was probably ,um,

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.510
that's probably the level where things in this range would be.

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.810
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.260
&gt;&gt; Okay. Alright, that seems kind of

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.340
reasonable. So sure, though what we're going to

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.570
do in this case is actually try to find a, a function that fits this.

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:45.260
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.630
&gt;&gt; Alright ,so what we can do is actually say, well what

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:51.170
if there is a linear relationship. What would be the best linear

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.335
function that captures the relationship between the size and the cost. So

00:02:55.335 --> 00:02:58.610
,what I have here is, it turns out of all the possible

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.710
linear functions, this is the one that minimizes the

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:07.240
squared error, the squared deviation, between these x points

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.280
and the corresponding position on green line. So it

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.300
finds a way of balancing all those different errors against

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.300
each other and that's the best line we've got.

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.340
Now in this particular case, it's interesting right, because if

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.360
you put your idea of 5,000 square feet. Look

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.100
what this line predicts. It's something more like $4,000, right.

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.590
Do you see that?

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:25.990
&gt;&gt; I do. That is doesn't seem right to me.

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:30.600
&gt;&gt; It doesn't, yeah, it doesn't really look like a very good fit. But it

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.050
does at least capture the fact that there

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:35.990
is increasing cost with, with increase in size.

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.860
&gt;&gt; That's true.
