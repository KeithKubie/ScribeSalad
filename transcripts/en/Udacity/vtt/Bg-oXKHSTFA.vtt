00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:04.350
So, what is the final advice you can
give an entrepreneur that starts

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:05.770
a design sprint?

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:08.560
&gt;&gt; The first key benefit of
a sprint is the opportunity for

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.540
everyone to participate
in the design and

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.980
decision making process
regardless of their background.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.960
A designer or researcher,

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.170
someone who is a user experience expert
will be able to come in as a leader, and

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.200
they'll be able to create great
prototypes or lead the user testing.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.450
An engineer, or a product manager, or
someone who doesn't have a lot of design

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:30.890
experience, will still
be able to participate.

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.590
Because they'll have tremendous
ideas as experts, and

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.638
they'll be able to contribute
by learning what the users want.

00:00:36.638 --> 00:00:40.772
By allowing the whole team to be
involved in the design process, and

00:00:40.772 --> 00:00:45.267
to make meaningful and fast decisions,
this sprint aligns the team, and

00:00:45.267 --> 00:00:48.549
now they're a real community
that has a common goal.

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:53.400
The second benefit of a sprint is the
ability to redefine your talent pool.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.410
Often, large companies and

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.110
startups are lacking key resources
that they need for the sprint.

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:01.420
Because sprints are short,

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.560
they're an opportunity to invite someone
who's missing talent from your team.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:09.000
If you don't have a researcher, you can
find and hire someone who's an esteemed

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.820
colleague or an expert in research, and
they can join you for two to five days.

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.030
That makes it so
your talent pool is much larger.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.440
And third, the sprints have
the obvious advantage of speed, and

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:22.660
speed is the ultimate advantage.
