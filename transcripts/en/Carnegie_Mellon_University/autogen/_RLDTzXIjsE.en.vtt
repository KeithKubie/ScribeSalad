00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.180
so if you look at urban systems today

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:13.190
so if you look at urban systems today
 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.209
so if you look at urban systems today
they basically have a whole bunch of

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:16.219
they basically have a whole bunch of
 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:19.150
they basically have a whole bunch of
systems traditionally speaking have been

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:19.160
systems traditionally speaking have been
 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.359
systems traditionally speaking have been
designed and continue to be operated

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:22.369
designed and continue to be operated
 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:25.150
designed and continue to be operated
essentially independent from one another

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:25.160
essentially independent from one another
 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.030
essentially independent from one another
so the question is do these things need

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:28.040
so the question is do these things need
 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.760
so the question is do these things need
to continue to operate independently can

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:30.770
to continue to operate independently can
 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:33.729
to continue to operate independently can
we actually make them or the city work

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:33.739
we actually make them or the city work
 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:37.060
we actually make them or the city work
much better be planned much better be

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070
much better be planned much better be
 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.190
much better be planned much better be
operated much better when the systems

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:39.200
operated much better when the systems
 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.440
operated much better when the systems
can actually talk to each other

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:40.450
can actually talk to each other
 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:42.190
can actually talk to each other
communicate with each other and

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:42.200
communicate with each other and
 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.799
communicate with each other and
coordinate with one another so a smart

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:44.809
coordinate with one another so a smart
 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:48.009
coordinate with one another so a smart
city would be a metropolitan region and

00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:48.019
city would be a metropolitan region and
 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:50.979
city would be a metropolitan region and
urban region where all the constituent

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989
urban region where all the constituent
 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:52.930
urban region where all the constituent
component systems are able to

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940
component systems are able to
 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.840
component systems are able to
communicate cooperate and coordinate any

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850
communicate cooperate and coordinate any
 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.869
communicate cooperate and coordinate any
innovations technologies and policies

00:00:58.869 --> 00:00:58.879
innovations technologies and policies
 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:01.930
innovations technologies and policies
that would actually make a city smarter

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940
that would actually make a city smarter
 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.500
that would actually make a city smarter
more functional more flexible could

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:05.510
more functional more flexible could
 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.020
more functional more flexible could
actually have global implications and

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030
actually have global implications and
 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.820
actually have global implications and
global applications and global adoption

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830
global applications and global adoption
 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.830
global applications and global adoption
so we would like to basically have

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840
so we would like to basically have
 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.490
so we would like to basically have
Pittsburgh be an exemplar smart city in

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500
Pittsburgh be an exemplar smart city in
 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.490
Pittsburgh be an exemplar smart city in
the country and in the world and we want

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500
the country and in the world and we want
 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.530
the country and in the world and we want
CMU to basically become innovation

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540
CMU to basically become innovation
 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:29.930
CMU to basically become innovation
leader in this context

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940
 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.000
you
