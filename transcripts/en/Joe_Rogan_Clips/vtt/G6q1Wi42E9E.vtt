1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.120
Do you have,
don't be evil in the cash him?
No,
no,
no.
You should not.

2
00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:07.170
Maybe just take it so on one of our,

3
00:00:07.171 --> 00:00:12.171
one of our like equivalent operating principles within cash and squares,

4
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.090
like under like how do we understand someone's struggle?
Like,
oh,

5
00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:18.450
how do we understand like how do we have the empathy for like what they're

6
00:00:18.451 --> 00:00:21.750
struggling with?
And like when it comes to finance,
they're struggling with a lot.

7
00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:26.520
Yeah.
Typically they're struggling with a ton.
What was the thought process with,

8
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:26.731
I mean,

9
00:00:26.731 --> 00:00:29.540
one of the things that's kind of cool about the cash app is that you can buy and

10
00:00:29.541 --> 00:00:31.740
sell bitcoin with it.
Yeah.
Um,
are you go,

11
00:00:31.741 --> 00:00:35.370
are you guys going to consider other forms of cryptocurrency as well?

12
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.000
Not right now.
I,
so back to the Internet.

13
00:00:39.001 --> 00:00:41.910
I believe that Internet will have a native currency.
Really.

14
00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:43.980
It'll have a native currency.
And I don't know if it's Bitcoin,

15
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.750
I think it will be good just given all the tests it's been through and the

16
00:00:48.751 --> 00:00:52.950
principles behind it,
how it was created.
And um,
you know,
it was,

17
00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.430
it was something that was born on the Internet that was developed on the

18
00:00:56.431 --> 00:01:00.240
Internet that it was tested on the Internet.
It is of the Internet.

19
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.740
And the reason we,
um,
you know,

20
00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.350
we enabled the purchasing of bitcoin within,

21
00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.760
within the cash APP is one we want to learn about the technology and we want to

22
00:01:11.761 --> 00:01:14.700
put ourselves out there and take some risk where the first publicly traded

23
00:01:14.701 --> 00:01:18.780
company to actually offer it as a service where the first publicly traded

24
00:01:18.781 --> 00:01:22.980
company to talk to the SCC about bitcoin in what that,
what that means.

25
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.240
And it made us uncomfortable.
We had to,
we had to,
you know,

26
00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.730
like really understand what was going on and,

27
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.260
and that was critical and important.
And then the second thing is that we,

28
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.610
you know,
we would,

29
00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.720
we would love to see something become a global currency.
I did.

30
00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.530
It enables more access.
It,
it allows us to serve more people.

31
00:01:43.531 --> 00:01:48.330
It allows us to move much faster around the world.
And,
um,
we,
uh,

32
00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.080
we,

33
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.670
we thought we were going to start with how you can use it transactionally,

34
00:01:53.671 --> 00:01:58.671
but we notice that people were treating it more like an asset,

35
00:01:59.131 --> 00:02:02.730
like a,
like a virtual gold.
And we wanted to,
um,

36
00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.710
we want to just to make that easy.

37
00:02:04.711 --> 00:02:08.700
Like I'm just the simplest way to buy and sell bitcoin.

38
00:02:08.701 --> 00:02:13.701
But we also knew that it had to come with a lot of education had to come with

39
00:02:14.401 --> 00:02:16.470
constraint because,
you know,

40
00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.240
two years ago people did some really unhealthy things about,
you know,

41
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.840
purchasing bitcoin.
They maxed out their credit cards and,
um,

42
00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.700
put all their life savings into,
into bitcoins.
So we,
we developed some,

43
00:02:28.701 --> 00:02:31.620
some very simple,
uh,
restrictions and constraints like you can,

44
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.130
you can't buy bitcoin on the cash app with a credit card.
You have to,

45
00:02:35.131 --> 00:02:39.270
it has to be the money you actually have in it.
And we look for day trading,

46
00:02:39.271 --> 00:02:42.660
which we,
uh,
we discourage and shut down like that.

47
00:02:42.661 --> 00:02:44.130
That's not what we were trying to build.

48
00:02:44.131 --> 00:02:46.410
That's not what we are trying to optimize for.

49
00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.890
We made a a children's book explaining what Bitcoin is and where it came from

50
00:02:52.561 --> 00:02:55.230
and how people use it and where am I be going.
So we,

51
00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.410
we really tried to take on the role of education and,
and,

52
00:02:59.411 --> 00:03:04.411
and have some like very simple healthy constraints that allowed to be allowed

53
00:03:05.471 --> 00:03:08.530
people to consider what their actions are in,
in the space.

54
00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.760
<v 1>Now when you have something like the cash app,
which is a,</v>

55
00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.790
it's very much a disruptive technology in terms of like decentralization of,

56
00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.370
of banks and,
and,
and,
and currency and you know,

57
00:03:21.371 --> 00:03:26.080
to have it where everything is going right at your direct depositing a paycheck

58
00:03:26.081 --> 00:03:28.990
right in the app if you so choose.
And then you could also buy bitcoin,

59
00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.730
which is another disruptive technology mean that this is a,

60
00:03:33.731 --> 00:03:38.731
another step towards this sort of new way of doing things.

61
00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.520
Yeah.
And is there pushback from,

62
00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.560
from any companies or is there

63
00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:45.671
<v 0>oh yeah.
Yeah.</v>

64
00:03:45.671 --> 00:03:49.390
I mean like you just look at like some of the major banks in their consideration

65
00:03:49.391 --> 00:03:50.224
around bitcoin.

66
00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.040
They all love blockchain because of the efficiencies that can create for their

67
00:03:54.041 --> 00:03:58.030
business and potentially new business lines.
But,
um,
you know,

68
00:03:58.031 --> 00:04:00.880
I think there is a explain blockchain to people for people that know what we're

69
00:04:00.881 --> 00:04:04.990
talking about.
Blockchain is a distributed ledger and it,
what that means is that,

70
00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.580
um,
it's basically a distributed database where,
you know,
the,

71
00:04:08.581 --> 00:04:13.210
the source of truth can be verified at any point around the network.

72
00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.520
And you can see,
you know,
um,
this,

73
00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.470
this annotation around how content or how are around money,

74
00:04:20.471 --> 00:04:24.520
like traveled.
Um,
so you don't have to go to an institution.
So the records,
yeah,

75
00:04:24.521 --> 00:04:28.000
there's no centralized check,
there's no centralized control over it.
Um,

76
00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.650
and I think that is a threatening,
it's,
it's,
it's certainly threatening,
um,

77
00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:36.970
to certain services behind banks and financial institutions.

78
00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:40.090
It's threatening to some governments as well.
Um,

79
00:04:40.091 --> 00:04:43.990
so I just look at this and like how do we embrace this technology,

80
00:04:43.991 --> 00:04:47.890
not react to it in a,
in,
you know,
more from a threat standpoint,

81
00:04:47.891 --> 00:04:52.720
but like what does it enable us to do and where does our value shift?

82
00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.110
And that's what we should be talking about right now is like how our value

83
00:04:56.111 --> 00:04:59.950
shifts.
And there's always really strong answers to that question,

84
00:04:59.951 --> 00:05:02.110
but if you're not willing to ask the question in the first place,

85
00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:06.730
you will become irrelevant because technology will just continue to march on and

86
00:05:06.731 --> 00:05:10.360
make you irrelevant.
And it's the people that like are,
are,
you know,

87
00:05:10.361 --> 00:05:13.780
growing up with this technology are born with the technology only knowing that

88
00:05:13.781 --> 00:05:18.580
technology or are asking the tough questions of ourselves that are going to be

89
00:05:18.581 --> 00:05:21.450
super disruptive to their business.
And they're,

90
00:05:21.451 --> 00:05:22.930
they're thinking about right now and they're,

91
00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.540
and they're taking actions and you know,
we're doing,

92
00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:29.020
we're doing that at square and we're doing that at Twitter.
And like that to me,

93
00:05:29.021 --> 00:05:33.490
represents longevity.
That represents our ability to,

94
00:05:33.491 --> 00:05:35.830
to thrive.
And we,
we got to push ourselves.

95
00:05:35.831 --> 00:05:39.490
We've got to make ourselves uncomfortable and we got to disrupt what we held

96
00:05:39.491 --> 00:05:43.290
sacred and,
and what we think is success at it.

97
00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:45.970
Because otherwise it's not going be bigger than what we have today.
