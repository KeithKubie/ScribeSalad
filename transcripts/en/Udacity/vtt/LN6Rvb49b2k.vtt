00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.727
Here is the French flag with three colors blue, white, and red. So, here it

00:00:05.727 --> 00:00:09.640
looks like we have to make three decisions. Are we in the first third, the

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:13.930
middle third, or the last one? In java you would start out with the first

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:19.061
condition, and I'll leave it to you to fill in the details in the exercise.

00:00:19.061 --> 00:00:23.093
Then, for the next part, you'll use an else if clause, so you simply write else

00:00:23.093 --> 00:00:29.187
if followed by another condition. And finally, you use an else for the

00:00:29.187 --> 00:00:35.065
remaining possibility. So, here you need to supply two conditions, is the point

00:00:35.065 --> 00:00:38.665
in the left, is it in the middle or otherwise, of course, it has to be in the

00:00:38.665 --> 00:00:45.998
rightmost part. This construction with if, else if. You can have other answers

00:00:45.998 --> 00:00:50.638
if you'd like. And then, finally is a else. This is what you do anytime you get

00:00:50.638 --> 00:00:54.688
multiple decisions. And I get worked down from the top to the bottom as you

00:00:54.688 --> 00:00:59.035
would expect. The first condition gets checked if it's fulfilled the statement

00:00:59.035 --> 00:01:03.724
is executed in here, and everything else is skipped. On the other hand, if the

00:01:03.724 --> 00:01:07.429
first condition wasn't true, one would move to check the second condition and

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:12.697
if that one was true, it would be executed. If it wasn't, then the third one

00:01:12.697 --> 00:01:17.496
would be executed. In other words, exactly one of these three blocks is

00:01:17.496 --> 00:01:24.010
executed, depending on which condition is true or whether none of them is true.

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:27.819
Well, now it's your turn to try that with the French flag. Again, you'll be

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:34.244
given a point x y that could fall anywhere within the flag. And you need to

00:01:34.244 --> 00:01:40.836
make a decision whether to return blue, white, or red. And when you do that be

00:01:40.836 --> 00:01:45.363
sure to use an if, else if, else construction.
