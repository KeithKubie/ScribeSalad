games library does for us let's start

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250
games library does for us let's start
 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.060
games library does for us let's start
using it so i'm going to go to our

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070
using it so i'm going to go to our
 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.060
using it so i'm going to go to our
downloads folder and I'm going to open

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070
downloads folder and I'm going to open
 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.730
downloads folder and I'm going to open
up our as of yet unused Play game

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740
up our as of yet unused Play game
 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.580
up our as of yet unused Play game
services folder and in here there's a

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590
services folder and in here there's a
 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.620
services folder and in here there's a
bundle and a framework and we're going

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630
bundle and a framework and we're going
 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.750
bundle and a framework and we're going
to add both of these into our Xcode

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760
to add both of these into our Xcode
 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.790
to add both of these into our Xcode
project just click and drag them in

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:30.800
project just click and drag them in
 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.350
project just click and drag them in
again if you are storing this in a

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360
again if you are storing this in a
 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.630
again if you are storing this in a
centralized folder that maybe many of

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640
centralized folder that maybe many of
 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.459

your applications were using you might

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469
your applications were using you might
 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.200
your applications were using you might
not want to copy items and keep it as a

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210
not want to copy items and keep it as a
 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.540
not want to copy items and keep it as a
reference in my case I do just so this

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550
reference in my case I do just so this
 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.490
reference in my case I do just so this
is a nice little standalone app so I'm

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500
is a nice little standalone app so I'm
 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.569
is a nice little standalone app so I'm
going to click finish and there they are

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:46.579
going to click finish and there they are
 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:49.729
going to click finish and there they are
so I'm going to drag my framework into

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739
so I'm going to drag my framework into
 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.209
so I'm going to drag my framework into
my frameworks folder and and there you

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219
my frameworks folder and and there you
 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.700
my frameworks folder and and there you
go important step is done there are a

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710
go important step is done there are a
 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.590
go important step is done there are a
few other steps we need to do before we

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600
few other steps we need to do before we
 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.720
few other steps we need to do before we
start using this library the first is

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730
start using this library the first is
 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.400
start using this library the first is
kind of an obscure 1 i'm going to go

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410
kind of an obscure 1 i'm going to go
 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.679
kind of an obscure 1 i'm going to go
into my info.plist file and I'm going to

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689
into my info.plist file and I'm going to
 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:12.609
into my info.plist file and I'm going to
add a new entry right click and do a dro

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619
add a new entry right click and do a dro
 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:15.200
add a new entry right click and do a dro
you can also do this by going to like

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210
you can also do this by going to like
 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.550
you can also do this by going to like
editor add item and we're going to call

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560
editor add item and we're going to call
 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.580
editor add item and we're going to call
this gpg application ID and this is the

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590
this gpg application ID and this is the
 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.010
this gpg application ID and this is the
11 or 12 digit number that is associated

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020
11 or 12 digit number that is associated
 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.530
11 or 12 digit number that is associated
with our application and there's two

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540
with our application and there's two
 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.710
with our application and there's two
ways you can get this the first is if we

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720
ways you can get this the first is if we
 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.130
ways you can get this the first is if we
were to just look at our client ID it's

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140
were to just look at our client ID it's
 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.710
were to just look at our client ID it's
basically the same number here so we can

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720
basically the same number here so we can
 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.620
basically the same number here so we can
just copy over this first numeric

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630
just copy over this first numeric
 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.260
just copy over this first numeric
portion of our client ID you can also

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270
portion of our client ID you can also
 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.370
portion of our client ID you can also
get this from the Google Play Developer

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380
get this from the Google Play Developer
 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.950
get this from the Google Play Developer
console if we were going to play google

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960
console if we were going to play google
 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.760
console if we were going to play google

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.429
com / app / publish and guess my number
this number right here that is also the

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439
this number right here that is also the
 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.260
this number right here that is also the
application ID so you can get it from

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270
application ID so you can get it from
 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.389
application ID so you can get it from
either place either way I'm just going

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399
either place either way I'm just going
 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.810
either place either way I'm just going
to copy it go back to my info.plist file

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820
to copy it go back to my info.plist file
 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.490
to copy it go back to my info.plist file
and paste it in there we go and then the

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500
and paste it in there we go and then the
 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.619
and paste it in there we go and then the
next thing we're going to do is go into

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629
next thing we're going to do is go into
 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.680
next thing we're going to do is go into
this

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690
this
 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.230
this
ACH file this is our precompiled header

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240
ACH file this is our precompiled header
 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.670
ACH file this is our precompiled header
and i'm going to add an import statement

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680
and i'm going to add an import statement
 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:26.850
and i'm going to add an import statement
here i'm going to add Play game services

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860
here i'm going to add Play game services
 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.150
here i'm going to add Play game services
/ Play game services H I don't know why

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160
/ Play game services H I don't know why
 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.380

it doesn't like to in M it but it

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390
it doesn't like to in M it but it
 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.990
it doesn't like to in M it but it
doesn't and this is sort of a nice way

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000
doesn't and this is sort of a nice way
 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.780
doesn't and this is sort of a nice way
of importing this basically into any

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790
of importing this basically into any
 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.820
of importing this basically into any
file that I'm going to use just to avoid

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830
file that I'm going to use just to avoid
 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.800
file that I'm going to use just to avoid
having to import it all over the place

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810
having to import it all over the place
 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.510
having to import it all over the place
because at some point you'll probably

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520
because at some point you'll probably
 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.540
because at some point you'll probably
forget I suppose this is optional if you

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550
forget I suppose this is optional if you
 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.970
forget I suppose this is optional if you
want to skip the step and just import it

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980
want to skip the step and just import it
 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.710
want to skip the step and just import it
manually and any file that's going to

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720
manually and any file that's going to
 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.870
manually and any file that's going to
use Play game services feel free to do

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880
use Play game services feel free to do
 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.910
use Play game services feel free to do
that as well I just find this is easier

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920
that as well I just find this is easier
 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.850
that as well I just find this is easier
for me next let's go back to our intro

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860
for me next let's go back to our intro
 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.950
for me next let's go back to our intro
view controller and let's go to our

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:00.960
view controller and let's go to our
 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:07.440
view controller and let's go to our
finished with off handler and this is

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450
finished with off handler and this is
 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.240
finished with off handler and this is
basically where we left off we had our

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250
basically where we left off we had our
 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.400
basically where we left off we had our
auth object and we haven't done a whole

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410
auth object and we haven't done a whole
 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.800
auth object and we haven't done a whole
lot else with it well now let's let's do

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810
lot else with it well now let's let's do
 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.020
lot else with it well now let's let's do
that now right above are finished with

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030
that now right above are finished with
 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.460
that now right above are finished with
off method I'm going to create a new

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470
off method I'm going to create a new
 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:23.250
off method I'm going to create a new
method called sign in to Google Play

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260
method called sign in to Google Play
 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:28.500
method called sign in to Google Play
games and this is essentially a method

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510
games and this is essentially a method
 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.080
games and this is essentially a method
that we will call to set up the google

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090
that we will call to set up the google
 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.390
that we will call to set up the google
play games library and generally

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400
play games library and generally
 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.120
play games library and generally
speaking we access this through a shared

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130
speaking we access this through a shared
 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.220
speaking we access this through a shared
singleton instance kind of the same way

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230
singleton instance kind of the same way
 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.920
singleton instance kind of the same way
we did with GPP sign-in the name of our

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930
we did with GPP sign-in the name of our
 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.479
we did with GPP sign-in the name of our
singleton class is gpg manager gpg here

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:45.489
singleton class is gpg manager gpg here
 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:47.430
singleton class is gpg manager gpg here
standing for google play games we're

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440
standing for google play games we're
 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.110
standing for google play games we're
going to access the shared instance and

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120
going to access the shared instance and
 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.000
going to access the shared instance and
then we're going to set up our of'

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010
then we're going to set up our of'
 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.550
then we're going to set up our of'
information with this library by calling

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560
information with this library by calling
 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.120
information with this library by calling
sign in now there are two arguments that

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.130
sign in now there are two arguments that
 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.759
sign in now there are two arguments that
we pass in here the first is a GPP

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769
we pass in here the first is a GPP
 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:02.190
we pass in here the first is a GPP
sign-in object so again we access this

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200
sign-in object so again we access this
 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.400
sign-in object so again we access this
through the singleton method shared

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.410
through the singleton method shared
 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:10.199
through the singleton method shared
instance and the next we pass in a

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209
instance and the next we pass in a
 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:12.720
instance and the next we pass in a
reauthorized Sandler or block this is

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730
reauthorized Sandler or block this is
 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:14.970
reauthorized Sandler or block this is
basically a handler that our gpg manager

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980
basically a handler that our gpg manager
 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.400
basically a handler that our gpg manager
needs to call if auth fails for some

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410
needs to call if auth fails for some
 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.920
needs to call if auth fails for some
reason typically this might happen if

reason typically this might happen if
 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.440
reason typically this might happen if
say your user plays your game for over

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.450
say your user plays your game for over
 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.870

an hour and their access token has

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880
an hour and their access token has
 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.420
an hour and their access token has
expired you might have noticed that they

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430
expired you might have noticed that they
 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.060
expired you might have noticed that they
all have an expiration time of 3600

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070

seconds a less common situation might be

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550
seconds a less common situation might be
 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.760
seconds a less common situation might be
that a user has gone into their account

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770
that a user has gone into their account

attempts to for instance submit a score
to a leaderboard so in both those

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050
to a leaderboard so in both those
 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.080

situations the manager needs to know

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090
situations the manager needs to know
 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.480
situations the manager needs to know
what to do and in general the correct

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490
what to do and in general the correct
 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:50.730
what to do and in general the correct
thing to do is just try signing the user

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740
thing to do is just try signing the user
 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.040

is kind of cool too so that's pretty

00:07:37.949 --> 00:07:37.959
is kind of cool too so that's pretty

good we're starting to look more like a
real application next up let's add a

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:41.770
real application next up let's add a
 

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:44.279
real application next up let's add a
sign out button and maybe perform a few

00:07:44.279 --> 00:07:44.289
sign out button and maybe perform a few
 

00:07:44.289 --> 00:07:46.079
sign out button and maybe perform a few
cleanup steps will do that in the next

00:07:46.079 --> 00:07:46.089
cleanup steps will do that in the next
 

00:07:46.089 --> 00:07:54.140
cleanup steps will do that in the next
lesson

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:54.150
