00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.270
One transform matrix worth a quick
mention is the mirror matrix,

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:04.970
also called the reflection matrix.

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.880
This matrix usually has one element here
be a -1, and the other two are ones.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.350
For example, here's a mirror matrix
that mirrors the Z coordinate.

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.970
This transform makes the Z axis
act something like a mirror.

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.130
Anything on one side of the axis
is mirrored to the other.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.810
You can create a mirror matrix
easily enough in three.js

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.090
by setting a scale value to -1.

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.210
There are in fact an infinite number of
mirroring matrices since by rotation and

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.159
translation you can move
the mirroring plain.

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:35.220
One major problem with the mirroring
matrix is that it not only flips

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.030
the triangle it also flips
the sense of the triangle.

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.680
Using the mirroring matrix converts
from a right handed coordinate

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.840
system to a left handed one or
vice versa.

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.990
That is in a right handed system
a triangle's vertices normally

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:51.060
proceed counter clockwise
around its edge.

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.120
After a mirror matrix,
this order's reversed.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.650
If you're using backface culling, for
example, you have to reverse the culling

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.800
sense from making the front side
visible to the back side visible.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.030
Even with this, I find that mirroring
matrices are tricky to use in three.js.

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.200
By default,
the reversal also affects lighting,

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.350
for example, making it look like lights
are coming from the opposite direction.

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.750
Maybe you'll have better luck and
if so put it in the forums.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.920
One place where mirroring sometimes
is used is when modeling.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.260
Instead of sculpting a whole moth,
for example, you can make half a moth.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.320
You then use a mirror matrix
to create the other half.

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.790
Sometimes you might encounter
a matrix in a data file and

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:29.410
don't know where it came from.

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.740
It might be a mirror so
that could really mess you up.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.092
You can use the matrix for

00:01:33.092 --> 00:01:36.470
a determinant call to see if there's
any mirroring in the matrix.

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.760
If the determine is negative,
it contains a mirror.
