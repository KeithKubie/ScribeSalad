00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:01.400
Now for this question,

00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:07.080
I'm going to propose a few potential
graphs that match up with this data,

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.510
and I want you to tell me which
one could possibly be correct.

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:13.330
Notice at this time,
I'm not giving you any grid lines, and

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:15.480
I'm not giving you a sense of scale.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.780
We don't know if this value is five or
a million.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.170
But, despite this lack of information,

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.480
I think you might be able
to figure out the answer.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.220
So tell me, could this graph be correct?

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:28.540
Or this one?

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:29.710
Or that one?

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.880
Choose the only option that could
possibly match with this data.
