00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.270
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:06.450
So that concludes the chapter,
a big chapter in this course.

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.410
It concludes time-dependent
perturbation theory.

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:15.520
The whole course is
largely organized

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.730
with approximation methods.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.070
We have done time-independent
perturbation theory.

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.710
We applied it to the
hydrogen atom in detail.

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:31.430
Then we did WKB, which is
slowly varying things in space.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.490
Then we did time-dependent
perturbation theory.

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:36.850
It had many parts to it.

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.920
It had Fermi's
golden rule, atoms.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.630
It had just
transitions in general.

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.950
The next step would be
adiabatic approximation,

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.610
which is time-dependent
changes but slow.

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:56.730
This is the time analog of WKB.

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.580
We're going to take
a little break.

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:02.540
And for half a lecture
today and the full lecture

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.000
next time, we're
going to do particles

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.850
in electromagnetic fields.

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.040
That's an important subject.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.640
It will involve Landau
levels and things

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.140
that you always hear about.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.990
And it will be useful for
some of the things we've done.

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.530
We've had a little exposure
to it with the Pauli equation.

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.820
You may remember the Dirac
and Pauli equation that

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.660
had this electromagnetic field.

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.840
So now we're going
to take seriously

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.700
the electromagnetic fields
and study how they interact

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:38.810
with quantum mechanics.

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.920
And there's a lot of very
interesting and beautiful ideas

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.020
having to do with
gauge invariance

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.030
and why potentials
are important.

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.880
Charged particles in
electromagnetic fields.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:02:03.236
So charged particles
in EM fields.

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.330
So what is our useful problem?

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.550
You have a particle with
mass m, now charge q.

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:23.500
And finally, there's an electric
field and a magnetic field.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.760
And there's going to be
interactions between them.

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.340
So there's E and B.

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.780
And you've gone through
this transition.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.340
Probably, you've been told
in electromagnetism something

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.080
along these lines.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.910
There is this E and B fields.

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.400
And those are the
physical fields.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.980
These are the things that do
stuff on charges and particles.

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.070
And there is this mathematical
entities that can help you,

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.790
which are potentials,
that allow you

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.780
to rewrite these fields in
terms of these quantities,

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:03.770
potentials.

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:06.560
And they're practical
to solve the equation.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.640
But the potentials are less
physical than the fields,

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.160
because the potentials
are ambiguous.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.740
You can change the
value of the potential

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:17.880
without changing
the electric field.

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.220
You can do things like that.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:29.750
Well, that is somewhat
misleading, put charitably.

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:34.550
It's a pretty wrong
viewpoint, actually.

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:38.090
As we will discover
and understand here,

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:43.700
the potentials are really more
important than the fields.

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.850
Quantum mechanics couples
to the potentials.

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.710
And as an afterthought,
if couples to the fields,

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:54.290
because it couples
to the potentials.

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:59.480
But even the definition of
an electromagnetic field,

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.280
at the end of the
day-- nowadays,

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:06.770
we really understand it as
a definition of potentials.

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:09.320
And I'll try to explain that.

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:14.210
This is pretty important if
you try to describe anything

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:16.880
that has topological content.

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.300
Most of the times, if
you're considering open

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:25.100
space, open Minkowsky space,
it doesn't make much difference

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.500
whether you take the electric
and magnetic field to be

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.510
fundamental or the potentials.

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:33.710
But as soon as you consider
anything topological,

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:38.000
a sample that lifts on a
toroidal surface, that's

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.030
a topological
space, then, if you

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:42.770
don't think about
potentials, you

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:45.920
could be absolutely
wrong, completely wrong.

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:49.310
Or if you have an
extra dimension, and in

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:52.700
many theories of physics, you
could have extra dimensions--

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:55.430
and you think about the
electric and magnetic fields

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:57.830
then, if you don't
think of potentials,

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:59.850
you can be quite wrong.

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:02.480
So let's explain
what's happening

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.280
with these potentials.

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.250
Basically, it all
starts from the idea

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:14.500
that you have a Maxwell's
equation del dot B equal 0.

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:17.500
And this is solved,
it is said, by setting

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:24.400
B equal to the curl
of A. And indeed,

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:30.550
if B is equal to the curl of
A, this equation is satisfied.

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:37.150
The other equation that is
relevant is this Faraday's

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:55.060
law, which if B is already curl
of A, you have that curl of E

00:05:55.060 --> 00:06:05.200
plus 1 over C da/dt
is equal to 0.

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:10.790
You see, I substitute
B here equal curl of A.

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:16.330
I commute the order of
derivatives, the dt the curl.

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:20.640
And this gives me this equation.

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:24.660
From this equation, we say
that anything that has 0 curl

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:27.090
is the gradient of something.

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:34.950
And therefore, we say that
E plus the 1 over c da/dt

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:41.520
is the gradient
of phi, from where

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.590
we find the second
equation, which

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:49.890
says that E can be obtained
as minus the gradient of phi

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:55.010
minus 1 over c da/dt.

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:56.190
I hope I have it right.

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:56.690
Yes.

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:04.320
So this is the origin
of the potentials.

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:05.760
You've seen that.

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:07.530
That's how they
explain, probably,

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:11.130
to you why you have potentials.

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:13.785
And indeed, this
is so far so good.

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:20.640
But now, there is a freedom
with this potentials which are

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:23.180
called gauge transformations.

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:26.850
So what are the gauge
transformations?

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:33.210
It's the possibility of changing
the potentials without changing

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:36.130
the electromagnetic fields.

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:44.370
So for example, since the curl
of the grad of anything is 0--

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:47.820
it's almost like
curl cross curl is 0.

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:52.740
This is the curl of the
grad of anything is 0.

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:58.760
You can change A
into a different A

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:05.210
that we'll call A prime,
given by A plus gradient

00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:08.640
of a function lambda.

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:13.640
And this will not change the
value of the magnetic field B,

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:18.620
because if you calculate
the magnetic field B,

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:23.390
the new magnetic field
associated to the new vector

00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:31.220
potential is equal
to curl of A prime.

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:35.179
But that's equal to
curl of A. And that's

00:08:35.179 --> 00:08:41.990
equal to the old B due to the
old magnetic vector potential.

00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:49.770
So the vector potential has
changed, but B the not change.

00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:54.560
On the other hand, if you
change the vector potential

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:59.690
by something like this,
now it can affect the E.

00:08:59.690 --> 00:09:07.940
But if simultaneously you change
phi, E will be left unchanged.

00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:12.020
So what should you do to phi?

00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:14.930
So this is the first one for A.

00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:17.360
If you want to keep
E unchanged, you

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:24.740
define phi prime equal to phi
minus 1 over c d lambda/dt.

00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:33.815
And then when you
compute the new E,

00:09:33.815 --> 00:09:37.440
you would do the gradient
of the new phi, which

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:40.290
will be the gradient
of the old phi,

00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:45.540
but an extra term, which
would be plus 1 over C

00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:50.720
d/dt of gradient of lambda.

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:53.860
And it will cancel
with the minus 1

00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:59.020
over C d/dt of the
gradient of lambda.

00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:08.110
So by changing A and phi in
this way, B and E are unchanged.

00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:11.470
So I can summarize this
gauge invariance statement

00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:18.490
by saying that the new electric
field due to due to phi

00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:25.810
prime and A prime is equal to
the electric field due to phi

00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:33.910
and A. And the magnetic
field new due to phi prime

00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:38.620
and A prime is equal
to the magnetic field

00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:47.780
due to phi and A.

00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:53.130
This is lifted to a principal.

00:10:56.570 --> 00:11:00.530
So we started describing
electromagnetic fields

00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:06.130
with E and B. We can
describe them with A and phi.

00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:09.220
And let's take that
seriously, because we'll

00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:11.850
need it for quantum mechanics.

00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:17.880
And we'll add now the extra
important physical assumption,

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:25.420
which is that phi
prime A prime is

00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:48.160
really equivalent, physically
equivalent to phi A.

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:53.660
And an electromagnetic
field configuration,

00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:58.100
as a mathematician will say,
is the equivalent classes

00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:00.090
of potentials.

00:12:00.090 --> 00:12:04.640
So you want to describe
an electromagnetic field?

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:05.900
I ask one of you.

00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:09.860
And you tell me what is phi and
what is A. I ask somebody else,

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:12.050
they give me another
phi and another A.

00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:14.150
And you say, they
look different.

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:15.650
But they may be the same.

00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:21.990
They are the same if they
are related by some lambda.

00:12:24.695 --> 00:12:27.680
I'll write it.

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:41.360
If there exists a lambda
such that they are gauge

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:45.880
transforms of each other.

00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:58.970
So before you say, you tell me
what the E is and what B is,

00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:00.970
and they have to agree.

00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:04.190
And you say, that's preferable,
because if E and B are

00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:05.390
the same, they agree.

00:13:05.390 --> 00:13:07.280
That's it.

00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:11.420
Why do we go through A and phi?

00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:12.800
They don't have to agree.

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:14.750
And they can be the
same, because if they're

00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:19.340
related with some lambda,
they are the same.

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:23.060
We seem to be going backwards
into a lot more complicated

00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:24.300
situation.

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:25.580
But that's what we need.

00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:31.040
And that's what the physics
tells you is really going on.

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:36.170
So some particular things that
are curious can happen now.

00:13:36.170 --> 00:13:37.730
And they're very curious.

00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:39.620
And there are examples.

00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:41.285
And we'll see some
of those examples.

00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:45.740
So curious effects.

00:13:50.840 --> 00:14:06.300
1, suppose phi and A and
phi prime and A prime

00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:19.360
give the same E and B. So
you and your peer editor

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:26.260
came up with some phi and A
and phi prime and A prime.

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:32.080
And they give the
same E and B. Are you

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:34.990
and your peer
editor on the hands

00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:38.560
of the same electromagnetic
field configuration?

00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:45.920
Maybe but not obvious.

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:48.170
In classical physics,
you would say, yes.

00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:50.770
If they give you the same E
and B, these are equivalent.

00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:55.730
No, now, you would
have to show that there

00:14:55.730 --> 00:15:01.610
is some lambda so that they are
gauge equivalent to each other.

00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:05.390
You see, the fact that they
are gauge equivalent guarantees

00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:10.520
they give the same B and E. But
if they give the same B and E,

00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:14.120
it may happen that you still
cannot find the lambda that

00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:19.220
relates them, because what
you have to do is try to take

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:22.280
your friend's A and
your friend's phi,

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:24.950
then this is yours and yours,
and now you have to find

00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:25.990
the lambda.

00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:28.650
And you have to solve a
differential equation.

00:15:28.650 --> 00:15:31.880
What if you can't
find the lambda?

00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:34.790
They give the same E
and B, but they're not

00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:38.050
gauge equivalent to each other.

00:15:38.050 --> 00:15:42.630
That means that you have
different field configurations.

00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:44.370
The fact that E
and B are the same

00:15:44.370 --> 00:15:49.570
doesn't mean they are the
same electromagnetic fields.

00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:56.550
And this can happen if you
have a little bit of topology.

00:15:56.550 --> 00:16:01.790
So suppose A and this
give the same B field

00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:14.650
but are not related by
a gauge transformation.

00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:29.700
Then these are
inequivalent EM fields.

00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:38.020
They could have different
quantum mechanics.

00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:39.460
And we will see that.

00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:44.340
So one example is what
people call Wilson loops.

00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:49.170
Wilson loops correspond to some
closed curve in space that you

00:16:49.170 --> 00:16:51.090
cannot contract.

00:16:51.090 --> 00:16:53.410
Of course, in Minkowski
space, in this room,

00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:55.170
I can contract anything.

00:16:55.170 --> 00:16:57.360
But sometimes, if
you live on a torus

00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:01.320
or your sample is on
a sphere or something,

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:04.230
you may not be able
to contract the curve.

00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:09.990
Along that curve, you can
put a vector potential

00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:13.560
that is pointing tangent
to the curve all the time.

00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:18.990
And it's a constant, a
constant vector potential.

00:17:18.990 --> 00:17:25.380
That constant vector potential
has 0 B and 0 electric field.

00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:29.460
But if that constant is small
or that constant is big,

00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:30.660
it's inequivalent.

00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:32.880
You won't find the
gauge transformation

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:35.340
that transforms each other.

00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:39.630
And therefore, those
would be configurations

00:17:39.630 --> 00:17:44.730
of electromagnetic fields
that give you the same E and B

00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:47.470
but are inequivalent.

00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:49.140
So that's the first
curious effect.

00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:51.795
There is another curious effect.

00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:02.140
And quantum mechanics is
forcing you to do that.

00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:06.030
That's the main thing.

00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:12.120
So the second curious
effect is, given

00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:29.336
an E and B that satisfy
Maxwell's equation,

00:18:29.336 --> 00:18:40.430
are these allowed fields?

00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:45.160
So somebody gives you an
E field and a B field.

00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:47.500
And you say, OK,
I'm going to check

00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:52.180
if these are possible physical
electric and magnetic fields.

00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:56.620
And then you go and check
Maxwell's equations.

00:18:56.620 --> 00:18:59.290
And Maxwell's
equations work out.

00:18:59.290 --> 00:19:01.270
They're all satisfied.

00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:03.790
You say, OK, this is good.

00:19:03.790 --> 00:19:07.840
Those electric and
magnetic fields are fine.

00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:10.810
Not so quick.

00:19:10.810 --> 00:19:15.010
To be sure those electric
and magnetic fields are fine,

00:19:15.010 --> 00:19:19.600
you should give me a phi
and an A that gives rise

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:24.580
to them, because fundamentally,
the electromagnetic fields are

00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:25.470
A and phi.

00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:29.840
And those you need anyway to
do quantum mechanics with it.

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:31.960
So if you have an
electromagnetic field and you

00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:35.860
cannot do quantum mechanics with
it, you would be suspicious.

00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:39.670
So you need to find phi and A.

00:19:39.670 --> 00:19:41.890
Are these allowed?

00:19:41.890 --> 00:19:57.910
Only if you can find a phi and
A. And sometimes that can fail.

00:19:57.910 --> 00:19:59.390
On a torus again--

00:20:05.170 --> 00:20:07.115
we've described in
this course as circle

00:20:07.115 --> 00:20:14.810
as a line x identified with
x plus L. So here is L.

00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:16.000
And you identify.

00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:24.030
A torus can be done by
taking a piece of the plane

00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:27.570
and identifying this line
with that and this line

00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:29.190
with this line.

00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:31.680
So you glue this,
form a cylinder,

00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:35.480
and then you glue
the other ends.

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:39.530
On a torus, you can put a
constant magnetic field.

00:20:39.530 --> 00:20:44.370
A constant magnetic fields
satisfies Maxwell's equations.

00:20:44.370 --> 00:20:47.690
So you say, oh, so you can put
any constant magnetic field

00:20:47.690 --> 00:20:49.160
in a torus.

00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:50.430
Wrong.

00:20:50.430 --> 00:20:54.680
The vector potential
has trouble existing.

00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:59.630
And only for particular
values of the magnetic field,

00:20:59.630 --> 00:21:02.270
there's a consistent
vector potential.

00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:07.020
You get the quantization of
the flux of the magnetic field.

00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:09.635
So that's another
example, an E and a B.

00:21:09.635 --> 00:21:12.770
A constant magnetic
field on a torus

00:21:12.770 --> 00:21:16.400
satisfies every Maxwell
equation you may want to do.

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:21.970
But still, it's not a valid
electromagnetic field,

00:21:21.970 --> 00:21:27.700
because there's no A and
phi that give rise to it.

00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:37.170
So those are our lessons in why
we need the vector potentials

00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:40.990
to describe physics
in quantum mechanics,

00:21:40.990 --> 00:21:43.150
electromagnetic physics.

00:21:43.150 --> 00:21:46.840
And then let's write,
therefore, the Schrodinger

00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:51.340
equation with the
electromagnetic fields.
