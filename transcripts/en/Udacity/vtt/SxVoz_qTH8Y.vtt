00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:02.490
Hello and welcome back.

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:03.330
In this lesson,

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.530
we'll discuss the problem of finding a
maximum matching and a bipartite graph.

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:10.520
A problem intimately related to
finding a maximum flow in a network.

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:15.570
Indeed, our initial algorithm will
come form a reduction to maximum flow.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.430
And at first maximum bipartite matching
might just seem like a special case.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:22.900
As we examine the problem
more carefully however,

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.460
we'll see some special structure.

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.490
And eventually, we'll use this
insight to create a better algorithm.
