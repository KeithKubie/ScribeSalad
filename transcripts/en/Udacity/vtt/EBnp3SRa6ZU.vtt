00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.860
Java code has a special way of saying things like me or my. It's this. We have

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:10.590
this reference. The this reference can be used to distinguish between instance

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.495
variables and parameters. Or local variables, which only belong inside the

00:00:15.495 --> 00:00:20.980
method. This, no pun intended, solves a problem that we had earlier. Remember

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.065
in the constructor for the person, we had to give the parameter this odd name,

00:00:25.065 --> 00:00:30.170
aName. If instead of using aName, we had just used name, then this code would

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:35.340
look like this, which won't work. If we name the parameter the same as the

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.340
instance variable, then this one just assigns the parameter. The value it

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.860
already has, nothing changes. But you can access the instance variable using

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:51.410
this. If you write this.name equals name, then you'll assign the value of name,

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:58.390
the parameter variable, into the instance variable. In Java, local variables

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.890
and parameter variables are considered first when looking up variable names. We

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:08.000
say that a local variable shadows an instance variable. The instance variable

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.060
is hidden in the shadow of the local variable. And to find the instance

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.720
variable again, you need to use this. This dot name equals name means set the

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.860
instance variable name to the value of the parameter name.
