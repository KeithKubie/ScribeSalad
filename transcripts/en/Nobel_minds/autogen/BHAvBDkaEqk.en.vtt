among phage in general in that they
don't kill the cell they in fact so the

00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:54.950
don't kill the cell they in fact so the
 

00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:57.220
don't kill the cell they in fact so the
infected cell continues to grow and

00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:34.999
phased a phage display construct
and I should say that from now on in the

00:15:34.999 --> 00:15:35.009
and I should say that from now on in the
 

00:15:35.009 --> 00:15:36.680
and I should say that from now on in the
lecture I'm going to simplify the

00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:36.690
lecture I'm going to simplify the
 

00:15:36.690 --> 00:15:38.920

constructs so I'm going to eliminate

00:15:41.530 --> 00:15:41.540

coke protein gene and just have a

00:15:47.809 --> 00:15:47.819

protein gene well I told you that that

00:15:57.139 --> 00:15:57.149
protein gene well I told you that that
 

00:15:57.149 --> 00:16:00.019
protein gene well I told you that that
Paul mode which gave me the antibody

00:16:00.019 --> 00:16:00.029
Paul mode which gave me the antibody
 

00:16:00.029 --> 00:16:02.300
Paul mode which gave me the antibody
against that protein so I should say

00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:02.310
against that protein so I should say
 

00:16:02.310 --> 00:16:05.449
against that protein so I should say
that this construct this phage was still

00:16:05.449 --> 00:16:05.459
that this construct this phage was still
 

00:16:05.459 --> 00:16:07.759
that this construct this phage was still
infective but when I mixed it with the

00:16:07.759 --> 00:16:07.769
infective but when I mixed it with the
 

00:16:07.769 --> 00:16:11.449
infective but when I mixed it with the
antibody against eco r1 protein it

00:16:11.449 --> 00:16:11.459
antibody against eco r1 protein it
 

00:16:11.459 --> 00:16:14.150
antibody against eco r1 protein it
blocked infection presumably because it

00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:14.160
blocked infection presumably because it
 

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:16.850
blocked infection presumably because it
bound to that piece of eco run protein

00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:16.860
bound to that piece of eco run protein
 

00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:18.889
bound to that piece of eco run protein
on the surface and prevented an

00:16:20.749 --> 00:16:20.759
infection and this is the first
 

00:16:20.759 --> 00:16:23.389

indication that the phage display

00:16:23.389 --> 00:16:23.399
indication that the phage display
 

00:16:23.399 --> 00:16:26.090

because the released particles were

00:25:48.479 --> 00:25:48.489
because the released particles were
 

00:25:48.489 --> 00:25:51.659
because the released particles were
released in tiny tiny numbers so there

00:25:51.659 --> 00:25:51.669
released in tiny tiny numbers so there
 

00:25:51.669 --> 00:25:52.589

two reasons for that

00:25:52.589 --> 00:25:52.599
two reasons for that
 

00:25:52.599 --> 00:25:55.919
two reasons for that
one is that any phage clone that

00:25:55.919 --> 00:25:55.929
one is that any phage clone that
 

00:25:55.929 --> 00:25:58.349
one is that any phage clone that
displayed happen to display a peptide

00:25:58.349 --> 00:25:58.359
displayed happen to display a peptide
 

00:25:58.359 --> 00:25:59.969
displayed happen to display a peptide
with high affinity for the receptor

00:25:59.969 --> 00:25:59.979
with high affinity for the receptor
 

00:25:59.979 --> 00:26:02.279
with high affinity for the receptor
would be a tiny minority of all the

00:26:02.279 --> 00:26:02.289
would be a tiny minority of all the
 

00:26:02.289 --> 00:26:04.070
would be a tiny minority of all the
original phage clones there and

00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:04.080
original phage clones there and
 

00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:07.589
original phage clones there and
furthermore the the capture processes

00:26:07.589 --> 00:26:07.599
furthermore the the capture processes
 

00:26:07.599 --> 00:26:10.619
furthermore the the capture processes
not very far from 100% efficient maybe

00:26:10.619 --> 00:26:10.629
not very far from 100% efficient maybe
 

00:26:10.629 --> 00:26:13.379
not very far from 100% efficient maybe
more like 1% of efficient if you're

00:26:13.379 --> 00:26:13.389
more like 1% of efficient if you're
 

00:26:13.389 --> 00:26:15.950
more like 1% of efficient if you're
lucky but it doesn't matter because

00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:15.960
lucky but it doesn't matter because
 

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:19.259
lucky but it doesn't matter because
remember that these particles are

00:26:19.259 --> 00:26:19.269
remember that these particles are
 

00:26:19.269 --> 00:26:23.879
remember that these particles are
infectious by simply by infecting fresh

00:26:23.879 --> 00:26:23.889

bacterial cells you can produce them you
can amplify them up to trillions or

can amplify them up to trillions or
 

00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:35.940
can amplify them up to trillions or
gazillions so this is the peptide using

rounds of affinity columns in fact on
 

00:52:09.740 --> 00:52:12.040
rounds of affinity columns in fact on
one pass we could enrich the phage or

00:52:12.040 --> 00:52:12.050
one pass we could enrich the phage or
 

00:52:12.050 --> 00:52:14.680
one pass we could enrich the phage or
antibody phage a thousandfold

00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:14.690
antibody phage a thousandfold
 

00:52:14.690 --> 00:52:16.390
antibody phage a thousandfold
and by growing the enriched phage and

00:52:16.390 --> 00:52:16.400
and by growing the enriched phage and
 

00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:17.890
and by growing the enriched phage and
passing it down the column a second time

00:52:17.890 --> 00:52:17.900
passing it down the column a second time
 

00:52:17.900 --> 00:52:19.990
passing it down the column a second time
we can enrich it a further thousandfold

00:52:19.990 --> 00:52:20.000
we can enrich it a further thousandfold
 

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:21.609
we can enrich it a further thousandfold
which means we've got a millionfold

00:52:21.609 --> 00:52:21.619
which means we've got a millionfold
 

00:52:21.619 --> 00:52:24.130
which means we've got a millionfold
enrichment over two rounds of selection

00:52:24.130 --> 00:52:24.140
enrichment over two rounds of selection
 

00:52:24.140 --> 00:52:27.460
enrichment over two rounds of selection
and in principle using three rounds of

00:52:27.460 --> 00:52:27.470
and in principle using three rounds of
 

00:52:27.470 --> 00:52:29.109
and in principle using three rounds of
selection you could get a billion-fold

00:52:29.109 --> 00:52:29.119
selection you could get a billion-fold
 

00:52:29.119 --> 00:52:30.520

then you could go up to George's

00:52:30.520 --> 00:52:30.530
then you could go up to George's
 

00:52:30.530 --> 00:52:32.140
then you could go up to George's
gazillion if you just increase the

00:52:32.140 --> 00:52:32.150
gazillion if you just increase the
 

00:52:32.150 --> 00:52:35.859

number of of cycles so we were very

00:52:35.859 --> 00:52:35.869
number of of cycles so we were very
 

00:52:35.869 --> 00:52:38.319
number of of cycles so we were very
pleased really that these folded

00:52:38.319 --> 00:52:38.329
pleased really that these folded
 

00:52:38.329 --> 00:52:40.540
pleased really that these folded
fragments could express on phage because

00:52:40.540 --> 00:52:40.550
fragments could express on phage because
 

00:52:40.550 --> 00:52:41.920
fragments could express on phage because
it certainly wasn't clear to us that

00:52:41.920 --> 00:52:41.930
it certainly wasn't clear to us that
 

00:52:41.930 --> 00:52:44.710
it certainly wasn't clear to us that
they would but it turned out to be what

00:52:44.710 --> 00:52:44.720
they would but it turned out to be what
 

00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:46.650
they would but it turned out to be what
the system seemed to work beautifully

00:52:46.650 --> 00:52:46.660
the system seemed to work beautifully
 

00:52:46.660 --> 00:52:50.339
the system seemed to work beautifully
so we then turned to making antibody

00:52:50.339 --> 00:52:50.349
so we then turned to making antibody
 

00:52:50.349 --> 00:52:56.579
so we then turned to making antibody

we shuffle them all up we end up getting

00:53:45.190 --> 00:53:45.200
we shuffle them all up we end up getting
 

00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:47.050

original and two new ones the red blacks
and the green whites now as you increase

00:53:53.620 --> 00:53:53.630
and the green whites now as you increase
 

00:53:53.630 --> 00:53:56.500
and the green whites now as you increase
the number of b-cells that you that you

00:53:56.500 --> 00:53:56.510
the number of b-cells that you that you
 

00:53:56.510 --> 00:54:00.550
the number of b-cells that you that you
use you you decrease the probability of

00:54:00.550 --> 00:54:00.560
use you you decrease the probability of
 

00:54:00.560 --> 00:54:02.280
use you you decrease the probability of
finding the original combination and you

00:54:02.280 --> 00:54:02.290
finding the original combination and you
 

00:54:02.290 --> 00:54:04.809
finding the original combination and you
increase the probability of finding new

00:54:04.809 --> 00:54:04.819
increase the probability of finding new
 

00:54:04.819 --> 00:54:08.680
increase the probability of finding new
combinations so for example if you took

00:54:08.680 --> 00:54:08.690
combinations so for example if you took
 

00:54:08.690 --> 00:54:10.510
combinations so for example if you took
a thousand b-cells in principle which

00:54:10.510 --> 00:54:10.520
a thousand b-cells in principle which
 

00:54:10.520 --> 00:54:13.000
a thousand b-cells in principle which
were all different in principle you get

00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:13.010
were all different in principle you get
 

00:54:13.010 --> 00:54:14.650
were all different in principle you get
a million different combinations by

00:54:14.650 --> 00:54:14.660
a million different combinations by
 

00:54:14.660 --> 00:54:16.870
a million different combinations by
combining them of which a thousand would

00:54:16.870 --> 00:54:16.880
combining them of which a thousand would
 

00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:19.809
combining them of which a thousand would
be the originals and 999 thousand would

00:54:19.809 --> 00:54:19.819
be the originals and 999 thousand would
 

00:54:19.819 --> 00:54:22.750
be the originals and 999 thousand would
be would be new combos so we were very

00:54:22.750 --> 00:54:22.760
be would be new combos so we were very
 

00:54:22.760 --> 00:54:24.370
be would be new combos so we were very
interested in new combos because

00:54:24.370 --> 00:54:24.380
interested in new combos because
 

00:54:24.380 --> 00:54:27.849
interested in new combos because
actually in if we were to take antibody

we need we knew we needed to generate
new combinations of heavy and light to

new combinations of heavy and light to
 

00:54:33.390 --> 00:54:36.560
new combinations of heavy and light to
generate new binding activities in order

so the immune system takes selected
b-cell clones and it subjects them to

b-cell clones and it subjects them to
 

00:57:01.890 --> 00:57:04.220

what I've shown here is on the left is

what I've shown here is on the left is
 

00:58:46.740 --> 00:58:49.579
what I've shown here is on the left is
we've biotinylated the antigen let it

we've biotinylated the antigen let it
 

00:58:49.589 --> 00:58:51.710
we've biotinylated the antigen let it
equilibrate with the phage and then

00:58:51.710 --> 00:58:51.720
equilibrate with the phage and then
 

00:58:51.720 --> 00:58:53.960
equilibrate with the phage and then
capture the phage bound to the antigen

00:58:53.960 --> 00:58:53.970

higher binding activity but there was a

00:59:06.230 --> 00:59:06.240
higher binding activity but there was a
 

00:59:06.240 --> 00:59:08.570

confounding issue which is touched on
 

00:59:08.580 --> 00:59:13.190
confounding issue which is touched on
here and that is that we discovered we

00:59:13.190 --> 00:59:13.200
here and that is that we discovered we
 

00:59:13.200 --> 00:59:15.260

it all the antibody heads express a

antibodies we found that a lot of our

00:59:24.980 --> 00:59:24.990
antibodies we found that a lot of our
 

00:59:24.990 --> 00:59:28.010

antibody heads were chewed off so a

00:59:28.010 --> 00:59:28.020
antibody heads were chewed off so a
 

00:59:28.020 --> 00:59:31.099
antibody heads were chewed off so a
phage antibody might have between 1 and

support which greatly complicated our

00:59:39.410 --> 00:59:39.420
support which greatly complicated our

selection of those with the highest

selection of those with the highest
 

00:59:41.609 --> 00:59:44.210
selection of those with the highest
binding affinity so we reduce this

00:59:44.210 --> 00:59:44.220
binding affinity so we reduce this
 

00:59:44.220 --> 00:59:46.760

purpose in which we created what so

00:59:52.970 --> 00:59:52.980
purpose in which we created what so
 

00:59:52.980 --> 00:59:54.950

antibody heads so actually what we end

00:59:57.080 --> 00:59:57.090
antibody heads so actually what we end
 

00:59:57.090 --> 01:00:03.609
antibody heads so actually what we end
up doing is is infecting that's right we

01:00:03.609 --> 01:00:03.619
up doing is is infecting that's right we
 

01:00:03.619 --> 01:00:06.980
up doing is is infecting that's right we
encode the antibody fusion on a so

01:00:06.980 --> 01:00:06.990
encode the antibody fusion on a so
 

01:00:06.990 --> 01:00:09.020
encode the antibody fusion on a so
called phage mid and we use a helper

01:00:09.020 --> 01:00:09.030
called phage mid and we use a helper
 

01:00:09.030 --> 01:00:10.700

subunits so we end up with antibodies

01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:14.850
subunits so we end up with antibodies
 

01:00:14.850 --> 01:00:16.790
subunits so we end up with antibodies
which have a single antibody on there or

01:00:16.790 --> 01:00:16.800
which have a single antibody on there or
 

01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:18.830
which have a single antibody on there or
otherwise they're completely bald now

01:00:18.830 --> 01:00:18.840
otherwise they're completely bald now
 

01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:21.020
otherwise they're completely bald now
the bald ones don't bind to anything so

01:00:21.020 --> 01:00:21.030
the bald ones don't bind to anything so
 

01:00:21.030 --> 01:00:22.760
the bald ones don't bind to anything so
that's very easy so you just end up with

01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:22.770
that's very easy so you just end up with
 

01:00:22.770 --> 01:00:27.770
that's very easy so you just end up with
those which are bearing the antibody so

01:00:27.770 --> 01:00:27.780
those which are bearing the antibody so
 

01:00:27.780 --> 01:00:31.609
those which are bearing the antibody so

that the diversity of the library is
 

01:00:50.130 --> 01:00:53.720
that the diversity of the library is
known and we can tune it to order but at

and then we assembled them to create our

01:01:12.710 --> 01:01:12.720
and then we assembled them to create our
 

01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:16.190

so we now got a huge library and we

01:01:26.810 --> 01:01:26.820
so we now got a huge library and we
 

01:01:26.820 --> 01:01:30.380
so we now got a huge library and we
could select that so we assemble the

01:01:30.380 --> 01:01:30.390
could select that so we assemble the
 

01:01:30.390 --> 01:01:32.150
could select that so we assemble the
library these featured segments as

01:01:32.150 --> 01:01:32.160
library these featured segments as
 

01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:34.160
library these featured segments as
indicated on the left and then we

01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:34.170
indicated on the left and then we
 

01:01:34.170 --> 01:01:37.160
indicated on the left and then we
selected that library and against

01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:37.170
selected that library and against
 

01:01:37.170 --> 01:01:39.410
selected that library and against
foreign and self-antigens and we now
