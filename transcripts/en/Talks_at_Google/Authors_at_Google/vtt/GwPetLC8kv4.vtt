[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.190
SHANE SNOW: I want to tell this
story of how General Andrew

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:13.030
Jackson was fresh off
his latest massacre when

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:17.620
he got the assignment to lead
an army of lawyers, whores,

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:21.130
Choctaw Braves, and black
guys to save America

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.460
from destruction, along
with a gang of pirates.

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.110
So, I was really
excited to say that,

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:29.590
but we should back up and
talk about the history.

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:34.542
In about 20 years after George
Washington had basically

00:00:34.542 --> 00:00:37.000
stopped being president-- he
decided that he was only going

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.470
to do two terms--

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.330
the country was in a
little bit of trouble,

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:45.340
because King George III
and his son, who I call 4G,

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.950
decided that they wanted to pay
themselves back for the losses

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:49.457
that they had in the Revolution.

00:00:49.457 --> 00:00:51.540
So, they lost a bunch of
money on this revolution,

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.230
they'd just been
fighting Napoleon,

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.830
so they sent a bunch of ships
to the East coast of America

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:01.420
just in international waters
to basically pirate goods

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.040
from American boats.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.750
And anyone with
a British accent,

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.840
they would conscript
into the British Navy.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.400
So, this was obviously
very annoying

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.480
to the new-found republic.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.590
And so Thomas Jefferson, who
was president at the time,

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.350
he had a solution to this
problem, which was just

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.370
to ban all imports and exports,
which immediately destroyed

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:22.390
the economy.

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.640
Historians say this is maybe
one of the dumbest things

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.110
any president has ever done.

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:27.970
Thomas Jefferson was very
good at writing Declarations

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:29.761
of Independence, it
turns out not very good

00:01:29.761 --> 00:01:32.720
at trade or
international affairs.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.370
So, he destroys the economy,
and then we're out of money.

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:39.880
So, to deal with
that, he says, well,

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.090
let's privatize the
military now, so

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:44.870
get rid of the
military, all that money

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:46.870
goes back to the government,
and this turned out

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.660
to be a problem when the
British then invaded.

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:51.250
They burned down
the White House.

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.290
They sacked all these
cities up and down

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.560
the East coast from
Maryland to Virginia.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.060
And meanwhile, all of these
American companies that

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.050
survived off of trading goods
and international shipments,

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:06.610
their goods rotted
on the wharfs,

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.880
and the economy was doing
terrible, basically.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.410
People started starving.

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.270
Companies started
going out of business.

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.230
And the British were fine.

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.740
So, what happened basically is--

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.799
this has never happened in
America before or since,

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:23.840
but everyone basically
flipped out on each other,

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.190
and they took sides.

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.670
The Democratic Republicans
burned down the newspapers

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.860
of their Federalist rivals.

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.720
The Federalists were like,
let's join the British.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.960
And so, it was a
horrible situation

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.830
that that happened just after
this new country had started.

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.820
And this is around the time
that King George III and 4G

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.390
said, hey, maybe we can
actually take this land back.

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:48.650
So the country is in shambles.

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:49.900
Everyone is mad at each other.

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.470
They're super broke now.

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.750
And they have no military.

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.100
And so they decided
to do it, basically.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.500
So they looked at the
map, and they said,

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.440
hey, we've burned
down all these cities,

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.860
taken over most
of the East coast.

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.650
All we've got to do is sail
up the Mississippi River,

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.830
and we can push the
Americans into the Atlantic.

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.960
So, this is a it's
one of those things

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.700
that, in American
history class we

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.590
learn about the
Revolutionary War,

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.267
and we learn about the Civil
War, and there's like one line

00:03:18.267 --> 00:03:19.850
that the history
teacher usually says,

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:21.800
and there was a war in 1812.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.540
But this is the story of what
happened in the War of 1812.

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:25.220
The British decided
they were going

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.020
to push the Americans
into the Atlantic.

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:29.600
So, they had sacked
all of these cities,

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.270
the North was ready to
join the British already,

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:36.750
but there's one thing standing
in the way of this plan,

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.350
and it was a little town,
sort of a raucous town

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:42.470
at the mouth of the Mississippi
River called New Orleans.

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.466
So, this was the
spot that they had

00:03:44.466 --> 00:03:46.340
to get past in order to
go up the Mississippi

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.840
and do the land invasion
to take over America.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.020
So, while everyone
in the United States

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:56.497
were suffering from this poverty
that the import-export ban had

00:03:56.497 --> 00:03:58.580
happened, and all these
people in all these cities

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.800
had been sacked, while
that was going on,

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.555
New Orleans was
during this big party.

00:04:02.555 --> 00:04:05.180
This is actually a picture of me
and my friends in New Orleans.

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:06.620
I'm there on the
right-hand side.

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.759
I'm like a cop
from 1979, I think.

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:10.550
That was Halloween.

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:13.320
So, they're doing this while
everything else was happening.

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.100
And this is thanks
to some local heroes

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.860
known as the Pirate
Brothers Laffite.

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:21.529
So, this group of
pirate brothers

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:24.500
was keeping New Orleans
in this nonstop party.

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:25.400
These are them.

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.080
So this is Pierre Laffite.

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.930
He ran the blacksmith shop,
where they would smuggle goods

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:33.140
in and then distribute them
to the city of New Orleans,

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:36.980
lots of rum and fine silks and
rugs and all sorts of things.

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:38.930
There was Dominic
You Laffite, who

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:42.890
was the guy that would sail
around the Caribbean and pirate

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:45.830
boats and take the goods to
be smuggled into New Orleans.

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:49.700
And then there was sort of the
PR guy, the face of the Pirate

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:51.980
Brotherhood, Jean Laffite.

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:53.531
So, I know that
this is what he's

00:04:53.531 --> 00:04:56.030
supposed to look like if we're
going with movies of pirates,

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:59.520
but when they make the
movie about the War of 1812,

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.840
this is who I want
playing Jean Laffite.

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.230
It's Ryan Gosling.

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:05.760
Anyway, Eric knows I'm
a big Ryan Gosling fan.

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.890
So, what was happening is these
pirate brothers were basically

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:11.120
keeping the city full of rum.

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.690
And the rule was that you
were actually legally allowed

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:17.090
to plunder any ship in
international waters

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:19.580
as long as your country
was at war with them.

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:21.560
So, the British,
when they started

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.050
plundering these American
boats, they weren't at war.

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:26.714
And then they declared
war, so then it was legal.

00:05:26.714 --> 00:05:28.130
So, these pirate
brothers actually

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:29.780
didn't refer to
themselves as pirates.

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:32.300
They called themselves
captains and privateers,

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.760
because they sailed under
letters of mark of Cartegna,

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:37.520
which is a city-state that
was conveniently at war

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:38.300
with everyone.

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.550
So, they're at war with
everyone so they could legally

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:41.630
plunder these boats.

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:46.490
But then the problem was getting
the goods from the ocean,

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:48.650
basically from the
Caribbean, to New Orleans.

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:51.120
It required them
to import stuff,

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.400
which was illegal at the time.

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.740
So, what they would do,
they had this little

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:57.930
set of islands that they would
basically dock their ships at,

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:00.470
and then they would row the
goods through the swamps.

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:02.553
And they would mysteriously
appear in New Orleans,

00:06:02.553 --> 00:06:05.690
and everyone was having a good
time partying, drinking rum.

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:07.340
So, this is going
on while the British

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:09.170
are taking over America.

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:14.836
And as long as the pirates
kept the city in rum,

00:06:14.836 --> 00:06:15.710
they left them alone.

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:17.660
So they sort of turned
a blind eye to this.

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:20.510
But Jean Laffite, being
the smart and handsome man

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:22.880
that he was, he was
stockpiling cannons

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:26.480
and flints and tinders just in
case they ever came for him.

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:31.010
So, the British army assembled
this enormous armada,

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:33.505
the largest armada ever
to set sail to sea.

00:06:33.505 --> 00:06:35.630
They had just defeated
Napoleon, so they're feeling

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:37.550
pretty confident about this.

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:40.470
And they took a look at
the map, and they said,

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:42.740
well, we have to
get up the twisting

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:46.275
curves of the
Mississippi River, and we

00:06:46.275 --> 00:06:48.770
have to knock out the New
Orleans defense, basically,

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:51.260
if we want to make
this plan work.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.900
So, they couldn't put
their ships up the river

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:56.480
very quickly, so they said,
let's do a ground invasion.

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:57.688
We'll knock out the defenses.

00:06:57.688 --> 00:06:59.390
Then we'll sail
our ships up, which

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:04.090
meant that they would have
to go through the swamp

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:06.710
and sneak-attack the
city of New Orleans.

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:09.762
So the British have about 20,000
troops and all of these ships.

00:07:09.762 --> 00:07:11.720
So, they park the ships
outside of New Orleans,

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:14.690
ready to put the troops and
sneakily get through the swamp

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:17.210
to take over New Orleans.

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:20.650
And that's around the
time that the colonel

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:23.980
of the British troops,
the he that's in here--

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:25.670
Colonel Nichols was his name--

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:29.110
he paid a visit to Jean
Laffite and apparently his dog

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:31.614
and offered him
$2 million to help

00:07:31.614 --> 00:07:34.030
them sneak through the swamp
so they could surprise-attack

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:36.570
the city of New Orleans.

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:38.440
And John Laffite,
being a pirate,

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:41.020
said, yeah, sure,
I'll take your money.

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:44.272
And then they went back to
the armada ready to get ready

00:07:44.272 --> 00:07:46.480
for the surprise-attack,
and Jean Laffite immediately

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:49.700
double-crossed them,
because he was a pirate.

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:51.340
So he went, and he
told the government

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:53.110
of New Orleans
immediately this plan,

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:56.545
that the British were going to
sneak-invade, which obviously

00:07:56.545 --> 00:07:57.670
everyone freaked out about.

00:07:57.670 --> 00:08:00.730
But this was interesting timing,
because the state government

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:02.360
had just declared
war on the pirates.

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:04.810
So, the state was upset
that the pirates were

00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:08.110
doing these illegal imports and
that the city of New Orleans

00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:09.490
wasn't doing anything.

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:13.420
So, the governor had just
barely declared a $500 reward

00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:16.150
for the capture of Jean Laffite.

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:19.660
And Jean Laffite,
being cocky and sexy,

00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:23.597
posted up handbills all around
the state for a $5,000 reward

00:08:23.597 --> 00:08:25.180
for the capture of
Governor Claiborne.

00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:27.340
So, this pissed
off the government,

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:29.729
and so they sent a
crew to basically raid

00:08:29.729 --> 00:08:31.270
their little pirate
island where they

00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:32.940
were importing all this stuff.

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:36.789
I'm going to get to
the point of this soon.

00:08:36.789 --> 00:08:41.807
But at the same time they were
double-crossing the British,

00:08:41.807 --> 00:08:43.390
all the Pirates were
hiding their shit

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:46.324
in the swamp from
the government.

00:08:46.324 --> 00:08:47.740
And what happened
around this time

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:51.460
is Pierre Laffite had
actually been captured.

00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:54.310
He'd been arrested as part
of this government raid.

00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:57.820
He mysteriously escaped
from prison around the time

00:08:57.820 --> 00:08:59.380
that John Laffite
told the government

00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:00.714
about this British plan.

00:09:00.714 --> 00:09:02.380
So, you can kind of
see what's going on.

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:05.176
He traded the information
for his brother's release,

00:09:05.176 --> 00:09:06.550
and then the
pirates disappeared.

00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:08.341
So they said, hey, the
British are coming--

00:09:08.341 --> 00:09:09.040
we're out.

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:11.260
Hid all their
stuff in the swamp.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.960
So, the new president
of the United States,

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:17.710
Madison, freaked out, because
the country is going down

00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:20.080
the tubes, the British
are going to take over.

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:21.280
And they had no army.

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:22.600
There's no military.

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:25.150
There's only one
person he could call,

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:27.570
and this was a little-known
militia commander, who

00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:30.220
had been busy basically
harassing and murdering

00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:35.770
Native Americans and clearing
out Tennessee for the settlers,

00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:37.840
basically, a
controversial figure

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:40.540
named Andrew Jackson,
who, like the pirates,

00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:42.430
was also a complicated fellow.

00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:45.670
He had recently attempted
to kill his own governor

00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:48.460
for some slight, some
insult. And he had just

00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:51.520
massacred a bunch of natives
and, in a strange twist,

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:54.700
adopted an American-Indian baby.

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:57.456
Very complicated, strange guy.

00:09:57.456 --> 00:10:00.190
And "strange" is the
right word to use for him.

00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:04.780
And he was called to go
lead some sort of defense

00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:06.460
of the city of New Orleans.

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:07.870
And he was nursing
a bullet wound

00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:10.577
at the time when he
got the call, because--

00:10:10.577 --> 00:10:11.410
this story is crazy.

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:14.440
He'd been shot after trying
to horsewhip some dude--

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:16.630
I had to put it up there
so I could remember--

00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:19.150
who had gotten mad when his
friend shot that dude's friend

00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:21.885
in the butt.

00:10:21.885 --> 00:10:23.260
We can go over
this again to make

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:24.550
sure the sequence is clear.

00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:26.950
A guy mooned Andrew
Jackson's buddy,

00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:30.100
so Andrew Jackson's buddy
shot him in the butt.

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:32.550
And that guy's friend got mad.

00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:33.310
Makes sense.

00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:36.280
So Jackson then horsewhipped
that guy for being mad.

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:39.100
And that guy shot
Jackson in the arm.

00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:42.580
So anyway, Andrew
Jackson shows up

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:45.730
to the city of New Orleans
with his arm in a sling

00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:49.312
and diarrhea, because he has
dysentery from the journey,

00:10:49.312 --> 00:10:50.270
I guess, in those days.

00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:52.930
I don't really know
how to spell dysentery.

00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:54.130
No one does.

00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:57.354
So he shows up, and the
situation is not good,

00:10:57.354 --> 00:10:59.770
because all they have to defend
the city from these 20,000

00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:02.920
British troops are 200 local
businessmen, a contingent

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:05.680
of feisty, local whores who
had signed up for ammo duty.

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:08.950
And he brought with him
1,800 Tennessee hunters.

00:11:08.950 --> 00:11:10.480
They call them Dirty Shirts.

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:12.250
These guys had never
really fought a war,

00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:15.880
but they were hunters with
these long, slow rifles that

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:18.950
had been part of these
Indian skirmishes.

00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:21.310
There was also a platoon
of freemen of color

00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:23.100
who hadn't been paid
in a while, but they

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:26.680
were part of a local militia
that had been disbanded.

00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:29.770
And he offered to pay
them if they joined up.

00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:34.570
There's a crew of Choctaw
Braves, 62 American Indian

00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:38.170
Braves who for some reason
were willing to help this guy

00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:41.980
and these people who had
been treating them badly.

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:45.040
And Andrew Jackson
promised to pay them.

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:48.400
And he gave this rousing
speech, where he said,

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:51.220
I know we have our
differences, but let's

00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:53.380
set aside those
differences for a second,

00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:56.140
and let's save the city
and maybe the country

00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:58.766
from these people that want
to invade our homeland.

00:11:58.766 --> 00:12:00.640
So he gave this speech,
and everyone cheered.

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:02.056
And then he went
back to his room,

00:12:02.056 --> 00:12:05.560
and he shit himself because
of the dysentery and also

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:09.430
because the British had this
enormous army against his 3,000

00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:12.460
misfits, none of whom had
ever fought a war before,

00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:14.630
like a real war.

00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:18.140
And so he knows that
this is a lost cause

00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:20.360
and that he's going to die
and all of these people,

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:22.880
who he just convinced
to defend the city,

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:24.276
are also going to die.

00:12:24.276 --> 00:12:26.900
And he knew what had happened in
these cities on the East Coast

00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:28.733
that had been sacked
and pillaged and burned

00:12:28.733 --> 00:12:30.740
and what the soldiers
did to the families

00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:34.160
and the women of these
soldiers that they'd killed.

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:37.070
And everyone was rightly
freaked out by this.

00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:40.130
So around this time, Andrew
Jackson, with his dysentery,

00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:43.310
gets a visit from a lawyer, a
guy named Edward Livingston,

00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:45.740
who was kind of like the
Saul Goodman of those days,

00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:48.845
if anyone knows Saul Goodman.

00:12:48.845 --> 00:12:50.470
This guy shows up,
and he says, there's

00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:52.480
another group of people
who could potentially

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:54.820
join your army.

00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:55.599
He says, who?

00:12:55.599 --> 00:12:57.640
He says, well, is Jean
Laffite and his merry band

00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:58.223
of privateers.

00:12:58.223 --> 00:13:00.580
Look at this good-looking guy.

00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:02.964
And Andrew Jackson says, no,
I don't deal with pirates.

00:13:02.964 --> 00:13:03.630
Are you kidding?

00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:04.380
They're criminals.

00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:05.590
We're not going to do this.

00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:07.840
Saul Goodman says, well,
they have a bunch of cannons.

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:10.930
He says, actually,
yes, OK, bring them on.

00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:13.630
So Jean Laffite becomes-- this
is why this should be a movie.

00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:15.250
John Laffite becomes
a co-strategist

00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:16.125
of the defense force.

00:13:16.125 --> 00:13:18.730
So he and Andrew Jackson
become the generals

00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:20.925
of this ragtag army.

00:13:20.925 --> 00:13:23.050
So now Andrew Jackson-- if
I haven't made it clear,

00:13:23.050 --> 00:13:24.550
I don't really like this guy.

00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:27.520
He had a lot of
hate in his heart.

00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:29.080
He hated Creoles,
which is basically

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:30.560
the Spanish and
French descendants,

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:33.700
the immigrant community
of New Orleans.

00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:36.050
He hated pirates because
they were criminals.

00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:37.840
He hated the American Indians.

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:39.820
He was not on the
right side of history

00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:41.440
when it came to black people.

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:43.130
He was a slave owner.

00:13:43.130 --> 00:13:44.955
And these were all the
people in his army.

00:13:44.955 --> 00:13:47.080
But he said, I guess this
is more important for now

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:49.990
than my personal hatred for
all these people who are not

00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:53.500
like me for whatever reason.

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:56.440
And thus was born the most
diverse army ever assembled

00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:59.580
in the history of
the United States,

00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:02.310
under-manned, outgunned,
but very, very

00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:03.810
interesting ragtag group.

00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:08.230
So I want to sit back and
talk for a second about teams.

00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:08.820
Now, I'm here.

00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:12.330
I'm going around to
Google and other places

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:13.890
to talk about this
book that I just

00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:16.950
wrote that everyone who's
here gets a free copy.

00:14:16.950 --> 00:14:18.907
So-- yeah, thanks.

00:14:18.907 --> 00:14:19.740
I hope you enjoy it.

00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:21.720
So, this is one of the
stories in the book.

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:23.340
It's about teamwork.

00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:26.280
And it's about the lie we've
been told our whole lives when

00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:29.160
it comes to working together
and it comes to teamwork.

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:31.470
And that lie is that two
heads are better than one.

00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:36.432
Turns out that two heads are
usually not better than one.

00:14:36.432 --> 00:14:37.890
And there's lots
of proof for this,

00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:41.160
but despite that,
we won planet Earth

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:42.535
because we could band together.

00:14:42.535 --> 00:14:43.410
We were smart enough.

00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:45.349
We were equipped to collaborate.

00:14:45.349 --> 00:14:47.640
So that's how we beat all
these crazy animals that were

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:48.984
much more ferocious than us.

00:14:48.984 --> 00:14:51.150
We were smart enough to
work together to build fire,

00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:52.650
to build civilization.

00:14:52.650 --> 00:14:55.830
And so there's a reason that
dogs look up to us and love us

00:14:55.830 --> 00:14:57.660
and they're not our master.

00:14:57.660 --> 00:14:59.250
We can make a range
of vocal sounds

00:14:59.250 --> 00:15:01.740
that they can't, so we can
communicate with each other.

00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:03.720
Even things like the
whites of our eyes

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:05.976
are three times the size
of any other primates.

00:15:05.976 --> 00:15:07.350
So when I'm looking
at something,

00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:08.370
you can tell what
I'm looking at.

00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:10.869
It makes it easier for us to
work on things, to collaborate,

00:15:10.869 --> 00:15:12.550
even if we can't communicate.

00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:14.190
And I was really
proud of this one.

00:15:14.190 --> 00:15:17.100
This is a hipster and a gorilla.

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:19.180
Our brains are
equipped for empathy,

00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:23.040
which means that we can mirror
the emotions of other people

00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:23.791
that we encounter.

00:15:23.791 --> 00:15:25.206
This is our brain's
way of helping

00:15:25.206 --> 00:15:26.340
us to care about someone.

00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:28.500
So when someone's in
trouble and they're

00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:30.420
running away from the
saber tooth tiger,

00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:31.584
we get adrenaline also.

00:15:31.584 --> 00:15:33.000
Our heart rate
elevates so that we

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.570
can run with them or
we can fight with them.

00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:38.644
And also, this empathy thing
helps us to love and care

00:15:38.644 --> 00:15:40.810
about people, so we stick
together with our families

00:15:40.810 --> 00:15:43.268
and so we stick together with
our tribes so we can survive.

00:15:43.268 --> 00:15:46.290
There are all these reasons why
humans are built to collaborate

00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:48.300
or were built to work together.

00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:51.650
But it turns out that
collaborating is hard.

00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:54.540
We say that synergy or
whatever, one plus one

00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:56.160
can equal more than two.

00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:57.767
Turns out that's
almost never true.

00:15:57.767 --> 00:15:59.850
They did these experiments
where they asked people

00:15:59.850 --> 00:16:03.190
to yell as loud as they could,
and they measured the decibels.

00:16:03.190 --> 00:16:04.800
And when you're in a room by
yourself yelling as loud as you

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:07.050
can, you'll yell a little
bit louder than when you're

00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:09.400
in a room full of six people.

00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:10.937
And that was sort of strange.

00:16:10.937 --> 00:16:12.520
They did these other
experiments where

00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:14.194
they had people pull on a rope.

00:16:14.194 --> 00:16:16.360
And it turns out that when
you're doing a tug of war

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:18.940
with a group of people,
you exert less force

00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:21.360
on the rope, a little bit,
than you do by yourself.

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:23.110
Even if you're like
this kid and you think

00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:25.619
you're pulling your hardest.

00:16:25.619 --> 00:16:27.910
And some people will say,
well, this is social loafing.

00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:30.799
Someone on the tug-of-war rope
or someone in the yelling room

00:16:30.799 --> 00:16:32.590
is slacking off because
of the group, which

00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:34.240
happens, definitely happens.

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:35.950
Some of this might
be coordination.

00:16:35.950 --> 00:16:38.330
You have a lot of people,
coordinating is hard.

00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:41.650
The only cliche more
common I think in business

00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:44.350
than synergy is how long it
takes to turn a battleship,

00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:44.920
right?

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:47.545
You have a lot of people, a big
organization is hard to change.

00:16:47.545 --> 00:16:48.460
It's slow.

00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:49.960
But there's other
stuff that happens

00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:53.630
that's psychological when humans
come together to work together.

00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:56.110
This is my favorite
series of stock photos.

00:16:56.110 --> 00:16:59.470
I like to call it "White Guy
Leads Brainstorm Session."

00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:02.170
So, it turns out that
over and over again,

00:17:02.170 --> 00:17:04.569
when researchers put people
in rooms or around a table

00:17:04.569 --> 00:17:08.500
to brainstorm ideas, a
group of the same people,

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:10.740
just as smart or the
same actual people,

00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:13.619
will come up with fewer ideas
and fewer good ideas together

00:17:13.619 --> 00:17:15.960
in the same room than
they will on their own

00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:18.550
and then if they just add
up their lists of ideas.

00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:21.147
And they've shown this so often
that one famous psychologist

00:17:21.147 --> 00:17:23.730
said that "business people must
be insane to use brainstorming

00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:24.869
exercises."

00:17:24.869 --> 00:17:27.089
My favorite, one
of their colleagues

00:17:27.089 --> 00:17:28.890
said that something
like, as surely

00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:31.560
as cigarettes lead
to lung cancer,

00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:35.370
brainstorming in groups leads
to not as good of ideas.

00:17:35.370 --> 00:17:36.660
So this is sort of depressing.

00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:38.280
And there's lots
of reasons for it,

00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:41.250
our need to fit into the group.

00:17:41.250 --> 00:17:43.530
Sometimes it's unsafe to
express certain ideas that

00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:45.180
might come to us
when we're alone,

00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:46.404
when there's a group dynamic.

00:17:46.404 --> 00:17:48.570
Whatever it is, we see this
phenomenon over and over

00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:51.090
and over again that when
we put our heads together,

00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:54.149
we usually don't add up to more.

00:17:54.149 --> 00:17:56.190
Maybe we add up to just
as much, but we certainly

00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:57.420
don't add up to more.

00:17:57.420 --> 00:17:58.200
And then there's
the other thing that

00:17:58.200 --> 00:17:59.850
happens when groups
come together,

00:17:59.850 --> 00:18:00.900
is we have differences.

00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:02.820
So we get in each other's faces.

00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:06.834
Our different opinions cause
us to fight, to have conflict.

00:18:06.834 --> 00:18:08.250
Sometimes we even
try to destroy--

00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:10.833
this is my second "It's Always
Sunny" slide, for anyone that's

00:18:10.833 --> 00:18:12.180
a fan of the show.

00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:16.270
Sometimes we try to destroy each
other when we come together.

00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:20.430
But the reality is that we
can't build anything big

00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:22.307
without more than one person.

00:18:22.307 --> 00:18:23.890
You can't make Google
with one person.

00:18:23.890 --> 00:18:24.930
That's why we're
all here, right?

00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:26.726
You can't build a
building by yourself.

00:18:26.726 --> 00:18:28.350
You can do a heart
surgery by yourself.

00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:30.016
You can't even clean
the stadium in time

00:18:30.016 --> 00:18:33.220
for the next game
with one person.

00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:35.910
So we endure this
loss of productivity

00:18:35.910 --> 00:18:37.410
that comes with group work.

00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:39.870
We endure these squabbles
and these fights

00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:42.600
and the jerks that
try and foil us.

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:44.840
And then we put up walls
against each other.

00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:46.465
We say, we don't want
to listen to you.

00:18:46.465 --> 00:18:49.190
We try and put our rivals
and our critics on the floor.

00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:52.000
And we beat our
plowshares into swords,

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.860
and we turn nuclear energy,
this wonderful potential power,

00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:58.890
into a bomb.

00:18:58.890 --> 00:19:02.220
And the very same thing
leads to all of this.

00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:05.380
It's the differences
we have between us.

00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:09.850
And yet, some teams actually
do manage to feel magical.

00:19:09.850 --> 00:19:12.070
And maybe some of you have
felt this way when you've

00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:14.590
worked together in groups or
you've been part of something

00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:17.567
where it feels like
whatever you're up to,

00:19:17.567 --> 00:19:18.650
you can do the impossible.

00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:20.110
You feel infinite.

00:19:20.110 --> 00:19:22.360
And sometimes the team
that isn't supposed to win

00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:25.082
overcomes the odds,
and they do win.

00:19:25.082 --> 00:19:27.040
Anyone that's had a family
knows that sometimes

00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:29.410
with human beings, one plus
one can equal more than two,

00:19:29.410 --> 00:19:30.830
literally.

00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:33.520
And so this is how
every great movement,

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:36.100
every great breakthrough
in history of society

00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:39.010
has come about, is when
different humans came together,

00:19:39.010 --> 00:19:40.100
and they worked together.

00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:42.870
They linked arms, and
they overcame the odds.

00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:44.630
And this is important,
because this

00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:46.660
what we're trying to do,
not just in our work,

00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:49.270
but in general, as we're
part of the team of humans

00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:51.070
that owns this planet now.

00:19:51.070 --> 00:19:53.470
But the reality is, when
humans come together,

00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:56.860
we either break down
or we break through.

00:19:56.860 --> 00:19:58.870
And the thing that leads
to both of those things

00:19:58.870 --> 00:19:59.900
is kind of the same thing.

00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:02.191
It's the subtle interactions
between our different ways

00:20:02.191 --> 00:20:02.917
of thinking.

00:20:02.917 --> 00:20:04.750
So this is the thing
that I've been obsessed

00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:07.870
with over the last
many years, as someone

00:20:07.870 --> 00:20:11.350
who is covering innovation
for magazines like "Wired"

00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:14.662
and then starting my own company
and realizing that we needed

00:20:14.662 --> 00:20:16.870
to work together better if
we wanted to break through

00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:18.590
instead of breaking down.

00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:20.740
And it turns out
that there is math

00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:23.410
behind this paradox of
synergy, or the lack

00:20:23.410 --> 00:20:25.480
thereof, that those
groups that do

00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:27.484
feel infinite that
do add up to more,

00:20:27.484 --> 00:20:28.900
they have something
going for them

00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:31.780
that has actually been proven
out in mathematical models.

00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:34.330
And so to explain this--
and I promise I'll get back

00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:36.730
to the pirate story--

00:20:36.730 --> 00:20:39.310
join me at a dinner
party where you've

00:20:39.310 --> 00:20:42.040
baked this delicious
chocolate cake for dessert

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:44.380
for your eight best friends.

00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:47.240
And it's a delicious
round cake, and you

00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:49.960
need to cut it into
eight equal slices.

00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:52.180
So, everyone kind of knows
how to do this, right?

00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:56.230
But pretend for whatever
reason the knife you're using

00:20:56.230 --> 00:20:57.040
is enchanted.

00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:59.380
It's a magic party
for some reason.

00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:02.260
And it's going to disappear
after you make three cuts.

00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:05.260
So how do you make eight
slices of cake with three cuts?

00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:07.780
Now, some people will instantly
know the answer to this,

00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:10.870
but most people, and me
included, will do this.

00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:13.660
They'll take the cake by cutting
it in half like a pizza, cut

00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:14.727
in half again.

00:21:14.727 --> 00:21:16.810
And then when you realize
that you're out of cuts,

00:21:16.810 --> 00:21:19.840
your third cut, if you had just
one more, you could make eight.

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:22.010
Third and final cut only
makes six slices of cake,

00:21:22.010 --> 00:21:25.850
and two of your friends know you
love them more than the others.

00:21:25.850 --> 00:21:27.647
So how do you solve this puzzle?

00:21:27.647 --> 00:21:29.980
How do you make three cuts
to make eight slices of cake?

00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:30.850
Someone--

00:21:30.850 --> 00:21:32.949
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:32.949 --> 00:21:33.740
SHANE SNOW: The z--

00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:34.240
yeah.

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:34.780
Yep.

00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:36.530
So, some people will
immediately see this.

00:21:36.530 --> 00:21:39.155
Some people say, well, you could
do some curvy S calculus cuts.

00:21:39.155 --> 00:21:41.321
Can't do that, because your
friends need to know you

00:21:41.321 --> 00:21:42.330
love them equally.

00:21:42.330 --> 00:21:44.986
So what you do is you cut it
in half, cut it in half again,

00:21:44.986 --> 00:21:46.610
and then you literally
turn the problem

00:21:46.610 --> 00:21:49.395
on its side, the z-axis, and
you cut it all the way through.

00:21:49.395 --> 00:21:51.950
Now, some of your friends
get less frosting this way,

00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:53.991
but if we pretend there's
frosting in the middle,

00:21:53.991 --> 00:21:56.270
then maybe they all
know you love them.

00:21:56.270 --> 00:21:59.515
I like to say that if you
give this puzzle to a kid,

00:21:59.515 --> 00:22:01.640
they might actually have
an easier time getting it,

00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:03.306
because they're this
high off the ground

00:22:03.306 --> 00:22:06.260
and they look at the
cake from this level.

00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:08.270
But all it takes is
turning the problem around

00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:10.790
to see that there's
a solution to it that

00:22:10.790 --> 00:22:12.420
makes eight slices of cake.

00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:14.750
So, this is a
literal, fun example

00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:17.020
of what I call one
half of our mental tool

00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:18.817
kit, which is perspective.

00:22:18.817 --> 00:22:20.650
So when psychologists
talk about perspective

00:22:20.650 --> 00:22:23.210
and neuroscientists, they
say that it is the way

00:22:23.210 --> 00:22:25.490
that we encode what we
encounter in the world

00:22:25.490 --> 00:22:28.060
into our own internal language.

00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:30.040
So inside of our brains,
we process things,

00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:32.248
and we internalize them in
our own little programming

00:22:32.248 --> 00:22:32.800
language.

00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:34.965
And everyone's is a
little bit different,

00:22:34.965 --> 00:22:36.340
but there are lots
of things that

00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:38.860
can help us to form similar
perspectives or not,

00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:42.250
so everything from
where you grew up,

00:22:42.250 --> 00:22:44.600
generation you grew
up in, who you are,

00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:47.050
how you identify,
to the stories,

00:22:47.050 --> 00:22:48.980
the experiences you've
had in your life.

00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:51.010
So, if we're walking
down the street

00:22:51.010 --> 00:22:55.300
and there's a building on fire,
if you've been in a burning

00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:57.670
building before, you're going
to encode that situation

00:22:57.670 --> 00:22:59.500
in a different
perspective then if you're

00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:02.800
a firefighter than me, who
I've never had anything

00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:03.550
to do with fire.

00:23:03.550 --> 00:23:05.560
So the things we've been
through in our lives

00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:08.320
help us form perspective.

00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:11.050
If I would hazard a guess
based on you saying the z-axis,

00:23:11.050 --> 00:23:14.305
probably something in your life
or training or whatever it is

00:23:14.305 --> 00:23:18.909
leads you to have that 3D
graph mentality in your head.

00:23:18.909 --> 00:23:19.450
I don't know.

00:23:19.450 --> 00:23:21.199
Are you an engineer
or mathematician or--?

00:23:21.199 --> 00:23:23.170
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:23.170 --> 00:23:24.610
SHANE SNOW: 3D CAD systems.

00:23:24.610 --> 00:23:25.870
Yeah, exactly.

00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:29.140
So you are used to looking
at physical problems

00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:31.522
literally from
three-dimensional perspectives.

00:23:31.522 --> 00:23:33.230
So there's lots of
things that form this.

00:23:33.230 --> 00:23:34.390
We all kind of know this.

00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:37.000
There's a second half
of our mental toolkit

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.970
that we'll go back to our party
and we'll talk about this.

00:23:39.970 --> 00:23:43.330
So, you have three
glasses of milk

00:23:43.330 --> 00:23:45.905
and three empty glasses
at this cake party.

00:23:45.905 --> 00:23:47.530
And the challenge,
for whatever reason,

00:23:47.530 --> 00:23:50.800
the puzzle is you need to
alternate these glasses so they

00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:52.510
go full, empty,
full, empty, full,

00:23:52.510 --> 00:23:56.140
empty so no two full glasses
are next to each other.

00:23:56.140 --> 00:23:58.570
Now, how do you do this
if, for whatever reason,

00:23:58.570 --> 00:24:02.622
again, magic, you can
only move one glass?

00:24:02.622 --> 00:24:05.080
And once again, some people
will instantly know the answer,

00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:06.496
and some people
will take a while.

00:24:06.496 --> 00:24:09.190
And if you're like me,
you think it's impossible.

00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:11.449
So, most people will
take the second glass,

00:24:11.449 --> 00:24:13.490
and they'll move it in
between these two glasses.

00:24:13.490 --> 00:24:14.800
And then you realize that
you had one more move,

00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:15.370
you could do this.

00:24:15.370 --> 00:24:17.650
So, most people will take
this and then move it here.

00:24:17.650 --> 00:24:19.880
There's still two glasses
next to each other.

00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:21.080
Does anyone have the answer?

00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:23.470
Anyone know how you
can move one glass

00:24:23.470 --> 00:24:25.576
and alternate them full, empty?

00:24:25.576 --> 00:24:26.700
Were you raising your hand?

00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:28.908
No?

00:24:28.908 --> 00:24:31.624
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:31.624 --> 00:24:33.540
SHANE SNOW: Yes, so you
take the second glass,

00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:35.145
and you pour it into
the second-to-last one,

00:24:35.145 --> 00:24:36.186
and then you put it down.

00:24:36.186 --> 00:24:37.754
You've only moved one glass.

00:24:37.754 --> 00:24:39.420
Now, I want to ask
people this question,

00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:41.520
and they don't get
it if I tell them,

00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:43.450
pretend that you just
got home from your job,

00:24:43.450 --> 00:24:45.469
your day job as a chemist.

00:24:45.469 --> 00:24:47.010
Most people will
then get the answer,

00:24:47.010 --> 00:24:48.780
because you realize
a chemist, their job

00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:50.640
is to pour things in and
out of beakers, I think.

00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:52.770
That's what we think of
when we think of a chemist.

00:24:52.770 --> 00:24:54.780
But this is called-- the
solution to this puzzle

00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:57.380
is basically heuristics.

00:24:57.380 --> 00:25:00.660
Heuristics are strategies,
approaches to solving

00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:02.320
a problem, or rules of thumb.

00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:04.320
There's lots of different
ways we refer to them.

00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:06.900
But heuristics sometimes
are very connected

00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:07.740
to our perspectives.

00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:10.800
How we see something leads
us to develop a different way

00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:13.140
to solve a problem or
approach a problem.

00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:14.809
But often they're very detached.

00:25:14.809 --> 00:25:17.100
So heuristics come from all
sorts of things, how you've

00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:19.320
had to navigate life,
but also very much

00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:22.022
comes down to your education
and, again, the experiences

00:25:22.022 --> 00:25:23.730
that you've had, what
you've been invited

00:25:23.730 --> 00:25:25.500
to do, what you've
been excluded from,

00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:27.624
how you have to go
navigate the world.

00:25:27.624 --> 00:25:29.790
My favorite example of this
that I wrote in the book

00:25:29.790 --> 00:25:33.300
is when I talk about police
work, detective work.

00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:37.320
Interviewed basically every
highest-ranking female officer

00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:42.180
in law enforcement, so ATF, FBI,
bunch of homicide detectives.

00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:44.730
And all of them
universally told me

00:25:44.730 --> 00:25:46.620
something really
interesting, which

00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:48.930
was-- because I had
the question of, why

00:25:48.930 --> 00:25:52.410
are there so few women
in law enforcement

00:25:52.410 --> 00:25:55.740
when statistics show that
women shoot people wrongfully

00:25:55.740 --> 00:25:58.490
six times less than men
do in law enforcement?

00:25:58.490 --> 00:26:00.000
So that's an
interesting question.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.470
You can read about it in the
first chapter of the book.

00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:04.680
But most of the
women I interviewed

00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:08.310
said, well, if you grow up and
realize around middle school

00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:10.560
that you have less upper-body
strength than the boys

00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:13.830
in your class, then your
solution to physical problems

00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:16.440
often is not the same
thing that they do.

00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:17.851
So you encounter a locked door.

00:26:17.851 --> 00:26:19.350
Instead of immediately
trying to see

00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:21.900
if you can knock it
down or kick it open,

00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:25.890
you actually resort
to potentially trying

00:26:25.890 --> 00:26:27.290
to compromise
whoever has the key

00:26:27.290 --> 00:26:29.850
or finding some way to negotiate
the opening of the door.

00:26:29.850 --> 00:26:31.590
And this is not universal.

00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:34.414
But in general, if you
grow up a certain way,

00:26:34.414 --> 00:26:37.080
then you develop different kinds
of strategies for certain types

00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:38.944
of situations.

00:26:38.944 --> 00:26:40.110
And that's just one example.

00:26:40.110 --> 00:26:41.520
But whatever it is
you've been through

00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:43.770
can be relevant to looking at
a problem in a different way

00:26:43.770 --> 00:26:45.145
or can be relevant
to approaching

00:26:45.145 --> 00:26:46.720
a problem in a different way.

00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:48.136
So the way this
all comes together

00:26:48.136 --> 00:26:50.650
with the math of
synergy is like this.

00:26:50.650 --> 00:26:52.830
You have this cartoon
mountain range,

00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:56.430
which represents any problem
you're ever working on in life.

00:26:56.430 --> 00:26:58.619
It can be represented
by a range of solutions.

00:26:58.619 --> 00:27:00.910
So if we pretend that every
peak on this mountain range

00:27:00.910 --> 00:27:02.720
represents a different
quality of solution--

00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:04.636
the taller the peak, the
better the solution--

00:27:04.636 --> 00:27:06.676
we can say any problem
you encounter in life

00:27:06.676 --> 00:27:07.800
can be represented by this.

00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:10.946
There's good solutions,
there's less good solutions.

00:27:10.946 --> 00:27:12.570
And whenever we're
looking at a problem

00:27:12.570 --> 00:27:13.470
or we're approaching
something, it's

00:27:13.470 --> 00:27:15.930
like we're hiking around this
mountain range in the fog,

00:27:15.930 --> 00:27:18.340
and you get to the top of a
peak, and you have to decide,

00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:20.298
do we go downhill and
try and find another one,

00:27:20.298 --> 00:27:21.760
or have we found a good one?

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:23.160
How do we navigate this?

00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:25.099
So your perspective
is basically where you

00:27:25.099 --> 00:27:26.390
get dropped on the mount range.

00:27:26.390 --> 00:27:28.000
So let's pretend this is me.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.790
I get dropped off here.

00:27:29.790 --> 00:27:30.780
You go uphill at first.

00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:33.000
You look for the closest
solution to the problem.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.850
And then my heuristic is
basically what I do next.

00:27:36.850 --> 00:27:38.130
So I grew up in Idaho.

00:27:38.130 --> 00:27:41.160
Let's pretend that in Idaho
in mountain-climbing school,

00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:42.752
they say the rule
of thumb is when

00:27:42.752 --> 00:27:45.210
you get to the top of the peak,
you go down the other side,

00:27:45.210 --> 00:27:47.040
and you walk 50 paces.

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:49.650
And if it starts going uphill
by then, then you keep going.

00:27:49.650 --> 00:27:50.880
And if it doesn't,
then you retreat back

00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:51.600
to the mountain peak you're on.

00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:53.520
You're probably in
a pretty good spot.

00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:56.220
So my heuristic, basically
I go down 50 paces.

00:27:56.220 --> 00:27:58.060
I say, nope, it's still fog.

00:27:58.060 --> 00:28:00.840
It's going downhill,
probably have a good solution

00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:01.507
to this problem.

00:28:01.507 --> 00:28:03.923
So you can see I haven't ended
up on a very good solution,

00:28:03.923 --> 00:28:06.180
but it is a solution to
whatever the problem is.

00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:09.559
Now, say someone on my team
has a similar perspective.

00:28:09.559 --> 00:28:11.100
She gets dropped
off on the mountain.

00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:12.684
She's looking at it
from the same way.

00:28:12.684 --> 00:28:14.266
We've worked together
for a long time,

00:28:14.266 --> 00:28:16.710
whatever the reason for us
having a similar perspective.

00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:18.131
But she has a
different heuristic.

00:28:18.131 --> 00:28:20.130
She went to a different
mountain-climbing school

00:28:20.130 --> 00:28:20.629
than me.

00:28:20.629 --> 00:28:23.399
And so she goes
uphill, and heuristic

00:28:23.399 --> 00:28:25.190
is you get to the top
of the mountain peak,

00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:27.023
go over to the other
side, and you hike down

00:28:27.023 --> 00:28:29.730
until you get to the trough
between two mountains.

00:28:29.730 --> 00:28:32.580
And then you look and you say,
which way goes up steeper?

00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:33.840
Whatever way that is, you go.

00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:35.620
So she gets down here.

00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:36.870
She says, this way is steeper.

00:28:36.870 --> 00:28:37.950
She goes up here.

00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:40.290
She gets to here, says,
nope, it's not as steep.

00:28:40.290 --> 00:28:42.610
I found a better
solution to the problem.

00:28:42.610 --> 00:28:44.944
Now, how teamwork usually
works is if we're a good team,

00:28:44.944 --> 00:28:47.026
then she'll yell down, and
she'll say, hey, Shane,

00:28:47.026 --> 00:28:48.870
I found a better
solution to the problem.

00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:50.110
Yay, teamwork.

00:28:50.110 --> 00:28:51.480
We got somewhere.

00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:54.030
And this is where that
two heads are better

00:28:54.030 --> 00:28:56.550
than one thing comes into play.

00:28:56.550 --> 00:28:58.465
It turns out that
this group is only

00:28:58.465 --> 00:29:00.840
going to be as smart as the
smartest person in this group

00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:02.360
or the person who
has the right tool

00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:04.665
kit, right combination of
perspective in heuristic

00:29:04.665 --> 00:29:05.665
to get the furthest.

00:29:05.665 --> 00:29:07.290
And then the rest of
the group follows.

00:29:07.290 --> 00:29:10.560
And this is where we get
things like best practices.

00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:12.360
So we find a solution
to whatever problem

00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:13.414
it is that's good.

00:29:13.414 --> 00:29:14.580
And then we say, this is it.

00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:15.760
This is the way to do it.

00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:17.400
We all start with
this perspective,

00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:19.650
and we all solve it this way.

00:29:19.650 --> 00:29:21.960
But little do we know,
there is a better solution

00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:23.940
out there that we
just can't get to.

00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:27.120
And in fact, our success leads
to this cognitive entrenchment,

00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:30.240
where we can't actually
see anything else.

00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:32.894
And maybe sometimes an
earthquake has happened.

00:29:32.894 --> 00:29:33.810
The world has changed.

00:29:33.810 --> 00:29:35.510
There's a new mountain
that we don't see.

00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:37.385
And disruption is
basically when someone else

00:29:37.385 --> 00:29:40.460
finds that and leaves us on
this lower mountain peak.

00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:42.655
So, how the math
of synergy works

00:29:42.655 --> 00:29:44.300
is someone with a
different perspective

00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:45.800
is like someone who
gets dropped off

00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:47.550
on a different part
of the mountain range.

00:29:47.550 --> 00:29:49.796
And then this dude
with the hat, however

00:29:49.796 --> 00:29:51.795
he navigates with his
perspective and heuristic,

00:29:51.795 --> 00:29:53.874
he's going to end up somewhere.

00:29:53.874 --> 00:29:55.790
And literally in this
cartoon, this works out.

00:29:55.790 --> 00:29:59.800
If we say, well, what if
we tried my way or her way,

00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:02.690
the go down to the steep
part, from his point of view?

00:30:02.690 --> 00:30:05.190
And if you do that, you actually
end up going the steep way.

00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:06.648
And this is how
the whole group can

00:30:06.648 --> 00:30:09.110
become smarter than any
one person in the group,

00:30:09.110 --> 00:30:10.610
is when you combine
the perspectives

00:30:10.610 --> 00:30:11.420
and the heuristics.

00:30:11.420 --> 00:30:13.990
So this is what's called
cognitive diversity

00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:15.890
in psychology.

00:30:15.890 --> 00:30:19.310
Basically, the more different
perspectives and heuristics

00:30:19.310 --> 00:30:20.960
we have for a
problem, the more we

00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:23.120
can turn it around and
potentially find solutions

00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:24.530
that are better than any group.

00:30:24.530 --> 00:30:26.790
So two heads are
only better than one

00:30:26.790 --> 00:30:30.240
if they have a diverse
combination of those things.

00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:32.960
So where does cognitive
diversity come from?

00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:35.655
Really, this cognitive mosaic
that we see the world through

00:30:35.655 --> 00:30:38.030
and we navigate the world
through, it's our perspectives.

00:30:38.030 --> 00:30:38.863
It's our heuristics.

00:30:38.863 --> 00:30:41.480
It's something I call how
you roll, how we attack

00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:43.190
the mountain, how we operate.

00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:46.060
And this is all formed
by our life experiences,

00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:48.710
the day-to-day
experiences we've had,

00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:52.070
our education, our work,
places we've been and lived,

00:30:52.070 --> 00:30:54.860
opportunities and exclusions
we've had, people we've met,

00:30:54.860 --> 00:30:56.568
people who have helped
us on our journey.

00:30:56.568 --> 00:30:58.115
This forms all of these things.

00:30:58.115 --> 00:31:00.240
And this is where we start
to get into work culture

00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:01.024
territory.

00:31:01.024 --> 00:31:02.440
What forms these
life experiences?

00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:05.670
Well, these are very much part
of our internal and external

00:31:05.670 --> 00:31:08.910
attributes, who we are, age,
gender, race, orientation,

00:31:08.910 --> 00:31:13.049
habits, parental status, you
grew up with parents or not.

00:31:13.049 --> 00:31:15.090
All these things form our
life experiences, which

00:31:15.090 --> 00:31:17.190
then form our cognitive mosaic.

00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:19.042
Now, all of these
things are not going

00:31:19.042 --> 00:31:21.000
to be relevant to every
problem, every mountain

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:22.500
range we work on.

00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:24.840
But many of them
are, and we tend

00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:27.491
to underestimate how these
different kinds of things

00:31:27.491 --> 00:31:29.740
lead us to have different
ways of looking at problems.

00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:32.530
So like I said, two heads
are only better than one

00:31:32.530 --> 00:31:34.880
if those heads see things
differently enough.

00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:36.510
And in the book, I
get deeper into kind

00:31:36.510 --> 00:31:40.470
of these mathematical models
for how this works but mostly

00:31:40.470 --> 00:31:43.560
through cartoon form.

00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:48.100
But it only works if you
actually combine these things.

00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:50.700
So, if you have people
with all this potential

00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:52.824
to find the solution
of the problem

00:31:52.824 --> 00:31:54.240
but you don't
listen to the person

00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:55.830
with the other perspective on
the other side of the mountain

00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:57.870
range, you say, la, la,
la, we're not listening,

00:31:57.870 --> 00:31:59.670
then you're not
going to get there.

00:31:59.670 --> 00:32:01.740
Or even worse, if
this person doesn't

00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:05.010
feel like it's safe enough to
speak up about what they see

00:32:05.010 --> 00:32:08.170
and how they see the
problem, or if they say,

00:32:08.170 --> 00:32:10.800
hey we don't care what you say,
you need to fit the culture,

00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:12.540
so get down off the mountain,
come over to this side

00:32:12.540 --> 00:32:13.390
and climb up here.

00:32:13.390 --> 00:32:14.830
This is the way we do things.

00:32:14.830 --> 00:32:18.740
That's the death of problem
solving and innovation.

00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:21.680
But this basically explains
kind of every problem

00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:23.490
in corporate America.

00:32:23.490 --> 00:32:25.670
So for any of this to
work, you don't just

00:32:25.670 --> 00:32:27.740
need the different
cognitive mosaics.

00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:29.710
You need cognitive
friction also,

00:32:29.710 --> 00:32:32.120
which, if I can go
on another diversion,

00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:33.620
this is not
coincidentally how we

00:32:33.620 --> 00:32:36.290
got hip-hop, which is the thing
that Eric and I have bonded

00:32:36.290 --> 00:32:37.070
over.

00:32:37.070 --> 00:32:39.250
So, I moved to New York.

00:32:39.250 --> 00:32:40.310
I grew up in Idaho.

00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:43.820
I did not know why Notorious
BIG was so notorious.

00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:45.710
I did not know how
to pronounce RZA.

00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:48.020
I thought it was R,
Z, A. I could quote

00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:50.900
every lyric to the song "Country
Girl, (Shake It For Me)"

00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:52.100
and "Fishing in the Dark."

00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:53.000
So I knew nothing about hip-hop.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:54.291
So I love the story of hip-hop.

00:32:54.291 --> 00:32:55.580
So forgive me if you know it.

00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:57.320
How we got hip-hop is
basically this idea

00:32:57.320 --> 00:32:58.580
of cognitive friction.

00:32:58.580 --> 00:33:01.040
Started with these dance
parties in the Bronx,

00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:03.950
where the party was
every weekend there would

00:33:03.950 --> 00:33:06.460
be dance hall where
they'd have two deejays,

00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:08.660
one DJ on one side, one
DJ on the other side.

00:33:08.660 --> 00:33:10.850
And the game was
see which DJ can

00:33:10.850 --> 00:33:13.447
get the party to dance on
their side of the dance hall.

00:33:13.447 --> 00:33:15.780
So this was all about what
music you brought every week,

00:33:15.780 --> 00:33:17.134
how loud your speakers were.

00:33:17.134 --> 00:33:19.550
People would show up every
week, and they'd do this party.

00:33:19.550 --> 00:33:23.490
And they'd pay money, and
then the DJs were all happy.

00:33:23.490 --> 00:33:25.100
And after a while,
the DJs started

00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:29.750
having these hype guys
announcing the next song.

00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:32.420
They'd try to drag people over
to their side of the party.

00:33:32.420 --> 00:33:33.230
And so they'd say,
hey, everybody,

00:33:33.230 --> 00:33:34.370
my DJ's got this great song.

00:33:34.370 --> 00:33:34.994
Come over here.

00:33:34.994 --> 00:33:36.220
Come dance.

00:33:36.220 --> 00:33:39.650
And then the MCs would start
getting really into it,

00:33:39.650 --> 00:33:42.480
and they'd do these sort
of fun couplets, where

00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:43.550
they'd be like--

00:33:43.550 --> 00:33:46.220
forgive me anyone
who watches this.

00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:48.600
They'd be like, hey, ho,
put your hands in the air,

00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:50.680
come on, y'all, like
that sort of thing.

00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:53.660
And one week, this
guy named Busy Bee,

00:33:53.660 --> 00:33:56.120
who was sort of
everyone's favorite,

00:33:56.120 --> 00:33:58.190
he was there hyping up his DJ.

00:33:58.190 --> 00:34:01.340
And he goes, ba-ditty, bada,
bang, de bang, diggy-diggy,

00:34:01.340 --> 00:34:04.080
put your hands in the air,
ya'll, that whole thing.

00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:08.050
And this other guy, the
other DJs hype man, his name

00:34:08.050 --> 00:34:11.389
was Kool Moe Dee, instead
of doing the same thing,

00:34:11.389 --> 00:34:15.020
like, hey, ho, come on, he
says, now hold on, Busy Bee,

00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:17.600
I don't mean to be bold, but
put that ba-ditty-ba bullshit

00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:18.710
on hold.

00:34:18.710 --> 00:34:20.460
And it was like,
[IMITATES RECORD SCRATCH]

00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:21.469
like record scratch.

00:34:21.469 --> 00:34:22.429
And everyone was like, what?

00:34:22.429 --> 00:34:23.804
And then he goes
for five minutes

00:34:23.804 --> 00:34:27.785
just with this rhyming
poetry, insulting Busy Bee

00:34:27.785 --> 00:34:29.792
and his music and his DJ.

00:34:29.792 --> 00:34:30.750
And everyone went nuts.

00:34:30.750 --> 00:34:32.639
They thought it was the
greatest thing ever.

00:34:32.639 --> 00:34:34.550
So then the next week-- you
imagine if that happens to you,

00:34:34.550 --> 00:34:37.400
you don't show up the next week
saying, hey, ho, ba-ditty-ba.

00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:38.780
You come prepared.

00:34:38.780 --> 00:34:41.719
And this turned into this
weekly battle of wits.

00:34:41.719 --> 00:34:44.570
And then it also turned into
this weekly battle of dance.

00:34:44.570 --> 00:34:46.969
And you didn't show up every
week with the same stuff

00:34:46.969 --> 00:34:47.570
as last week.

00:34:47.570 --> 00:34:49.760
You showed up ready
for the battle.

00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:53.154
And Jay-Z was actually on
Letterman's new Netflix show

00:34:53.154 --> 00:34:54.320
recently talking about this.

00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:57.214
And he said, you know,
this wasn't actually

00:34:57.214 --> 00:34:58.380
about destroying each other.

00:34:58.380 --> 00:34:59.504
It was all about the party.

00:34:59.504 --> 00:35:01.420
We knew that this
competition, this battle

00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:03.080
was about making
this party better.

00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:04.150
We're all in on it.

00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:06.650
You wanted to win, but
more people showed up,

00:35:06.650 --> 00:35:09.020
we all made more money,
everyone made more--

00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:11.220
Jay-Z was young
when this happened.

00:35:11.220 --> 00:35:13.022
But that's what this is about.

00:35:13.022 --> 00:35:15.230
But it got to the point
where the DJs started hacking

00:35:15.230 --> 00:35:16.280
their equipment.

00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:18.680
Grandmaster Flash soldered
on a little switch

00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:20.691
into his record
player to fade down

00:35:20.691 --> 00:35:22.940
the music so he could fade
up music on another record.

00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:24.023
Everyone blew their minds.

00:35:24.023 --> 00:35:25.630
Everyone then tried to do that.

00:35:25.630 --> 00:35:27.707
When they started doing
electronic samples,

00:35:27.707 --> 00:35:29.540
DJ's would actually
crack open the equipment

00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:31.665
and add more memory so they
could do better samples

00:35:31.665 --> 00:35:32.870
and beat the other guy.

00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:36.500
And so out of this
competition, this friction,

00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:39.230
was born not only hip-hop,
but all of the genres of music

00:35:39.230 --> 00:35:43.300
that came after it, R&amp;B and
whatever the hell dubstep is.

00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:48.860
And also, actual innovation
in computers came from this.

00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:51.470
And so this is again
kind of a literal example

00:35:51.470 --> 00:35:53.090
of how innovation
is actually born

00:35:53.090 --> 00:35:56.300
from the friction between the
different ways of our thinking.

00:35:56.300 --> 00:35:58.020
You didn't show up
doing the same thing.

00:35:58.020 --> 00:35:59.570
That would have been dumb.

00:35:59.570 --> 00:36:02.090
But if it wasn't for this
competition, this battle

00:36:02.090 --> 00:36:04.631
of wits, we wouldn't have got
hip-hop and all the things that

00:36:04.631 --> 00:36:05.200
came with it.

00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:07.490
So I kind of chart
out if you look

00:36:07.490 --> 00:36:09.946
at potential energy
between a group of people,

00:36:09.946 --> 00:36:12.320
you can sort of chart it like
this as like a rubber band.

00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:13.490
The more you
stretch, the more you

00:36:13.490 --> 00:36:15.980
put tension on a rubber band,
the more potential energy

00:36:15.980 --> 00:36:16.571
it has.

00:36:16.571 --> 00:36:17.570
Same thing with a group.

00:36:17.570 --> 00:36:19.790
A group of people with different
perspectives and heuristics

00:36:19.790 --> 00:36:21.456
are like people pulling
on a rubber band

00:36:21.456 --> 00:36:22.950
from different sides.

00:36:22.950 --> 00:36:24.920
Now we're all afraid
of the part where

00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:26.270
the rubber band snaps, right?

00:36:26.270 --> 00:36:27.350
It hurts.

00:36:27.350 --> 00:36:29.919
But if we don't go
that far, then there's

00:36:29.919 --> 00:36:30.710
a lot of potential.

00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:33.168
You can shoot the rubber band
really far or whatever it is.

00:36:33.168 --> 00:36:35.789
You can make a whole
industry that hip-hop made.

00:36:35.789 --> 00:36:37.580
And anyone who knows
the history of hip-hop

00:36:37.580 --> 00:36:40.400
knows that at some point
it actually did go too far.

00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:41.240
Things got personal.

00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:42.906
There's an East coast,
West coast thing.

00:36:42.906 --> 00:36:44.566
People actually got murdered.

00:36:44.566 --> 00:36:46.940
And the whole music industry
stepped back and said, well,

00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:47.780
what are we doing this for?

00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:48.571
What is this about?

00:36:48.571 --> 00:36:51.020
Is this about elevating the
party, making better music?

00:36:51.020 --> 00:36:55.610
Or is this about literally
trying to kill each other.

00:36:55.610 --> 00:36:57.985
So this is what we're all
afraid of when we work together

00:36:57.985 --> 00:36:59.568
with people who are
different than us,

00:36:59.568 --> 00:37:02.150
is this tension, this friction,
which could lead to snapping

00:37:02.150 --> 00:37:03.770
or could make it
an unsafe place.

00:37:03.770 --> 00:37:05.228
But this is actually
the thing that

00:37:05.228 --> 00:37:07.070
gives us all the
potential in the world,

00:37:07.070 --> 00:37:08.990
combining our perspectives
and our heuristics,

00:37:08.990 --> 00:37:12.350
which are shaped by our life
experiences and who we are.

00:37:12.350 --> 00:37:15.320
This is how we get into
this zone of possibility.

00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:17.190
And this is where
innovation happens.

00:37:17.190 --> 00:37:21.760
So in a group of people,
if you're a leader,

00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:23.790
you want to get the
group into this zone

00:37:23.790 --> 00:37:25.122
of cognitive friction.

00:37:25.122 --> 00:37:27.330
You want to push things out
of that destruction zone,

00:37:27.330 --> 00:37:29.082
and you want to
depressurize things.

00:37:29.082 --> 00:37:31.290
You want to prevent also
this inertia from happening,

00:37:31.290 --> 00:37:33.420
where everyone gets
along too famously, where

00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:36.660
all of our ideas, we all agree,
no one is willing to speak up

00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:40.170
or to battle or be someone's
intellectual opponent.

00:37:40.170 --> 00:37:42.600
And so the best leaders,
the best groups actually

00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:46.047
try and push things into
this zone of possibility.

00:37:46.047 --> 00:37:47.880
So I'm going to get
back to the pirate story

00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:49.650
in like three minutes.

00:37:49.650 --> 00:37:52.120
But the missing ingredient
for any of this to work--

00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:53.911
it's great if you have
cognitive diversity.

00:37:53.911 --> 00:37:55.530
It's great if you have friction.

00:37:55.530 --> 00:37:58.037
But if you're not willing to
change or adapt because of it,

00:37:58.037 --> 00:37:59.370
then what is it good for, right?

00:37:59.370 --> 00:38:00.786
You can have an
argument, and then

00:38:00.786 --> 00:38:02.900
if no one changes their
minds, what is it for?

00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:04.941
So this thing called
intellectual humility, which

00:38:04.941 --> 00:38:08.430
is the last few
chapters of my book,

00:38:08.430 --> 00:38:10.680
get into this idea of
being able to transcend

00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:13.475
your own way of thinking,
which is extremely hard,

00:38:13.475 --> 00:38:14.850
it turns out, for
the human brain

00:38:14.850 --> 00:38:17.160
to do once we've
become entrenched

00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:18.641
in a way of doing something.

00:38:18.641 --> 00:38:20.640
So, to get at that, I
want to tell a quick story

00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:22.042
about these two guys.

00:38:22.042 --> 00:38:24.000
They were two engineers
that were collaborating

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:25.260
about 100 years ago.

00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:29.820
And if you walked by their
shop on any given day,

00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:31.650
you'd hear them
yelling at each other.

00:38:31.650 --> 00:38:33.312
Their assistants,
their neighbors

00:38:33.312 --> 00:38:34.770
were really worried
that these guys

00:38:34.770 --> 00:38:36.210
were going to punch
each other out or kill

00:38:36.210 --> 00:38:37.390
each other at some point.

00:38:37.390 --> 00:38:41.280
You walk by, and it's screaming,
yelling, arguing all the time.

00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:43.830
But then if you'd walk by
their shop around lunchtime,

00:38:43.830 --> 00:38:45.896
you'd hear nothing, like quiet.

00:38:45.896 --> 00:38:48.270
But then after lunch, the
screaming, yelling would start.

00:38:48.270 --> 00:38:50.040
Basically what
these guys would do

00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:52.340
is they'd be working
on a problem,

00:38:52.340 --> 00:38:55.040
they'd be trying to figure
out the solution to something,

00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:57.765
and they'd purposely start
these really intense arguments,

00:38:57.765 --> 00:39:01.500
where they'd take extreme sides
and really yell at each other.

00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:03.210
But then at lunchtime,
they would stop,

00:39:03.210 --> 00:39:05.100
they'd eat their
sandwiches, and then

00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:07.180
they would switch
sides of the argument.

00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:09.388
So one guy had to argue the
other guy's side and vice

00:39:09.388 --> 00:39:09.970
versa.

00:39:09.970 --> 00:39:12.150
And this forced them
to let go of their need

00:39:12.150 --> 00:39:15.114
to be right, to detach their
ego from their intellect

00:39:15.114 --> 00:39:17.280
in whatever this argument
was and forced them to use

00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:18.540
a little bit of
intellectual humility

00:39:18.540 --> 00:39:20.580
so they could amp up
this cognitive function,

00:39:20.580 --> 00:39:22.290
they could have these
really intense debates.

00:39:22.290 --> 00:39:23.700
But it didn't matter if
you lost, because you were

00:39:23.700 --> 00:39:24.908
going to switch sides anyway.

00:39:24.908 --> 00:39:26.850
So it was about pushing
that party forward.

00:39:26.850 --> 00:39:30.452
And this might sound like
a hostile work environment,

00:39:30.452 --> 00:39:32.660
if you think about yelling
at your coworkers all day.

00:39:32.660 --> 00:39:33.720
But you'll forgive
them when you learn

00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:35.640
that these are the two guys
that invented the airplane.

00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:37.120
This is Orville
and Wilbur Wright.

00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:38.250
And maybe they
could actually have

00:39:38.250 --> 00:39:40.583
the fights be really intense
because they were brothers.

00:39:40.583 --> 00:39:42.030
They knew that they were family.

00:39:42.030 --> 00:39:43.950
They would be OK.

00:39:43.950 --> 00:39:45.842
But they deliberately
did this because they

00:39:45.842 --> 00:39:47.550
wanted to get to the
top of the mountain,

00:39:47.550 --> 00:39:50.880
but they knew that when
you're ready to murder Wilbur,

00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:52.630
you've got to switch sides.

00:39:52.630 --> 00:39:53.955
You need to change.

00:39:53.955 --> 00:39:55.830
So this is their little
trick for doing this,

00:39:55.830 --> 00:39:57.780
for unlocking this equation.

00:39:57.780 --> 00:39:59.490
So, moral of the
story is we need

00:39:59.490 --> 00:40:02.040
to be able to change our
minds because of this stuff.

00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:03.660
We need to value the friction.

00:40:03.660 --> 00:40:07.140
We need to value the
cognitive diversity

00:40:07.140 --> 00:40:09.120
if we want to get
anywhere further than we

00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:10.350
can go on our own.

00:40:10.350 --> 00:40:12.100
But we need to be able
to change to do it.

00:40:12.100 --> 00:40:14.216
So this in a nutshell
explains all the reasons

00:40:14.216 --> 00:40:15.840
corporate America
sucks and why we have

00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:17.720
so many problems in the world.

00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:19.470
And it's a starting
point for figuring out

00:40:19.470 --> 00:40:22.110
how we can make our
teams and our communities

00:40:22.110 --> 00:40:26.010
and societies better, actually
leaning into these things.

00:40:26.010 --> 00:40:29.130
So speaking of impressive
teams, the British army

00:40:29.130 --> 00:40:30.690
was fucking dope.

00:40:30.690 --> 00:40:33.582
They had 20,000 troops
that just beat Napoleon.

00:40:33.582 --> 00:40:35.040
And they figured
out pretty quickly

00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:36.930
that Jean Laffite wasn't
going to show up to guide them

00:40:36.930 --> 00:40:37.530
through the swamps.

00:40:37.530 --> 00:40:39.450
So they're like, great,
our cover is blown.

00:40:39.450 --> 00:40:43.871
But we have 7-1 odds against
these misfits in this party

00:40:43.871 --> 00:40:44.370
city.

00:40:44.370 --> 00:40:46.050
They're probably
all drunk anyway.

00:40:46.050 --> 00:40:48.231
So, they rode their
boats through the swamp.

00:40:48.231 --> 00:40:50.730
And they make camp right outside
of the city of New Orleans,

00:40:50.730 --> 00:40:52.605
ready to just use like
a British-style ground

00:40:52.605 --> 00:40:54.990
invasion, rows and rows
of thousands of soldiers

00:40:54.990 --> 00:40:58.950
and their great outfits
to just overrun the city,

00:40:58.950 --> 00:41:00.100
take over America.

00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:01.600
So that night as
they're camped out,

00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:06.630
they're getting ready for
this battle, a ship floats,

00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:10.290
a pirate ship, in fact, floats
down the Mississippi River

00:41:10.290 --> 00:41:14.100
and docks right off the
shore of this camp of 20,000

00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:16.020
British soldiers.

00:41:16.020 --> 00:41:17.260
And it stops.

00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:18.787
And it waits.

00:41:18.787 --> 00:41:19.620
And it does nothing.

00:41:19.620 --> 00:41:22.100
And they fired some
warning shots at it.

00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:23.850
And the British decided,
they're like, oh,

00:41:23.850 --> 00:41:25.560
this little tiny ship, whatever.

00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:28.250
It's probably a
fisherman or some idiot.

00:41:28.250 --> 00:41:29.470
And so they go to bed.

00:41:29.470 --> 00:41:31.470
They have their sentries
up, but they go to bed,

00:41:31.470 --> 00:41:32.850
and they're watching it.

00:41:32.850 --> 00:41:34.720
And then the pirate
ship opens fire,

00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:37.230
just cannons after
cannons after cannons,

00:41:37.230 --> 00:41:38.936
cannon balls into the camp.

00:41:38.936 --> 00:41:40.560
They're not making
a dent on this army,

00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:42.270
but it's really hard to sleep.

00:41:42.270 --> 00:41:44.576
And they have to kind of
batten down, hide in the mud.

00:41:44.576 --> 00:41:46.200
They get done with
all the cannonballs.

00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:51.250
They start shooting cutlery and
random things into the camp.

00:41:51.250 --> 00:41:54.555
And so this is very annoying
to the British army, obviously.

00:41:54.555 --> 00:41:56.430
There's no way that
you're going to still win

00:41:56.430 --> 00:41:58.150
7-1 odds with this going on.

00:41:58.150 --> 00:42:01.260
But they're ruining their
sleep, really obnoxious.

00:42:01.260 --> 00:42:04.200
And then meanwhile, anyone
who ran into the woods to pee

00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:06.480
would run into this
guy and get tomahawked.

00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:09.240
So these Choctaw Braves
were out there basically

00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:12.510
murdering anyone who got
too far away from camp.

00:42:12.510 --> 00:42:16.140
And they had taught their
rivals, the Dirty Shirt

00:42:16.140 --> 00:42:18.370
Tennessee hunters,
had to climb trees

00:42:18.370 --> 00:42:21.750
and to sit in the top of a
tree and assassinate anyone

00:42:21.750 --> 00:42:24.474
who was a target, basically.

00:42:24.474 --> 00:42:26.640
So the British thought this
was really unchivalrous.

00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:28.723
Again, they're not making
a huge dent in the army,

00:42:28.723 --> 00:42:30.190
but this is really
bad for morale.

00:42:30.190 --> 00:42:31.856
They thought it was
really unchivalrous.

00:42:31.856 --> 00:42:33.787
This is not how noble
wars are fought.

00:42:33.787 --> 00:42:36.120
You're supposed to line up,
look each other in the eyes,

00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:36.703
and do battle.

00:42:36.703 --> 00:42:38.257
This is how war was done.

00:42:38.257 --> 00:42:40.090
So Colonel Nichols, the
head of the British,

00:42:40.090 --> 00:42:43.606
he sent an envoy to Jackson
that night to cordially

00:42:43.606 --> 00:42:45.480
request that they meet
in the field of battle

00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:47.470
and fight like men of honor.

00:42:47.470 --> 00:42:51.056
And Jackson literally
said, go fuck yourself.

00:42:51.056 --> 00:42:52.680
And he sent this
envoy back, and he was

00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:53.929
like, you're invading my land.

00:42:53.929 --> 00:42:55.020
Fuck you.

00:42:55.020 --> 00:42:58.697
So in the morning, the
British, demoralized, tired,

00:42:58.697 --> 00:43:00.780
their friends are being
murdered in the night when

00:43:00.780 --> 00:43:03.209
they go to pee, everyone is
afraid to pee, they get up,

00:43:03.209 --> 00:43:03.750
they line up.

00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:05.580
They're like, OK,
we're going to do this.

00:43:05.580 --> 00:43:08.310
So Jean Laffite and
the freemen of color

00:43:08.310 --> 00:43:11.070
teamed up to build a
moat and a dirt rampart.

00:43:11.070 --> 00:43:14.190
So they lined the city
with this rampart.

00:43:14.190 --> 00:43:17.460
They built it out into the
swamp kind of strategically so

00:43:17.460 --> 00:43:19.380
that you had to go
over this rampart.

00:43:19.380 --> 00:43:21.360
It was only about this high.

00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:23.647
But this was their
defense force.

00:43:23.647 --> 00:43:25.980
And so the British, as they're
tromping through the mud,

00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:27.180
they're coming up on this.

00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:29.460
Now, this is how all
of the paintings show.

00:43:29.460 --> 00:43:32.790
They're like, oh, Andrew
Jackson boldly there,

00:43:32.790 --> 00:43:34.440
no one is shooting him.

00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:35.850
When I make the
movie about this,

00:43:35.850 --> 00:43:39.000
it's going to be Ryan Gosling,
which is who is really

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:41.910
up there manning the fort.

00:43:41.910 --> 00:43:45.780
Anyway, so what happened
is the Dirty Shirt riflemen

00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:48.300
were waiting in the trees
with their hunting rifles.

00:43:48.300 --> 00:43:50.640
And then Jackson
issued everyone whiskey

00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:54.280
supplied by the pirates
and the British charge.

00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:57.684
So they line up, they charge,
the defenders open fire.

00:43:57.684 --> 00:43:59.100
And it turned out
that the hunting

00:43:59.100 --> 00:44:03.309
rifles that these Dirty Shirt
riflemen had were really slow.

00:44:03.309 --> 00:44:05.350
They're not what you want
in this kind of battle.

00:44:05.350 --> 00:44:08.112
But they can shoot way further
than the British muskets.

00:44:08.112 --> 00:44:09.570
So they basically
just assassinated

00:44:09.570 --> 00:44:10.470
all of the British leaders.

00:44:10.470 --> 00:44:11.428
They all sat on horses.

00:44:11.428 --> 00:44:13.240
They were very visible targets.

00:44:13.240 --> 00:44:15.320
And you're not
supposed to do that.

00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:17.340
Like you're not
supposed to do that.

00:44:17.340 --> 00:44:18.980
They did it anyway.

00:44:18.980 --> 00:44:20.860
And so the British come up.

00:44:20.860 --> 00:44:21.860
And the worst part--

00:44:21.860 --> 00:44:24.431
they were so obedient,
this army, that you're

00:44:24.431 --> 00:44:25.430
supposed to take orders.

00:44:25.430 --> 00:44:28.260
You don't do anything that's,
you know-- their core value was

00:44:28.260 --> 00:44:29.960
like obedience to leadership.

00:44:29.960 --> 00:44:34.710
And this one platoon of
Scotsmen, the 90-second Scots,

00:44:34.710 --> 00:44:37.560
their captain yelled, halt!

00:44:37.560 --> 00:44:39.300
And then he got assassinated.

00:44:39.300 --> 00:44:40.830
And so they halted,
and they stayed

00:44:40.830 --> 00:44:43.304
there until like 800
of them got shot.

00:44:43.304 --> 00:44:45.720
Finally another captain came
in, and he was like, retreat!

00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:47.670
And they're like, thank God.

00:44:47.670 --> 00:44:51.480
And it's like this horrible kind
of case study of actually being

00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:53.827
stuck on a mountain peak
that is not the optimal one,

00:44:53.827 --> 00:44:56.160
even when probably some people
there could have spoke up

00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:58.160
and said, we should
probably not halt right now.

00:44:58.160 --> 00:45:01.810
Anyway, so the battle
was really awful.

00:45:01.810 --> 00:45:04.230
But after the smoke cleared
from the first assault,

00:45:04.230 --> 00:45:07.800
the British had lost 3,500
men, and the Americans

00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:11.180
had lost 333, so 7-1
odds against them

00:45:11.180 --> 00:45:13.930
but 10 to 1 casualties
in their favor.

00:45:13.930 --> 00:45:16.290
The British realized this
is going to be way too hard.

00:45:16.290 --> 00:45:17.789
We're not going to
make this happen.

00:45:17.789 --> 00:45:18.680
So they went home.

00:45:18.680 --> 00:45:19.930
And New Orleans threw a party.

00:45:19.930 --> 00:45:21.388
And this is the
reason why we don't

00:45:21.388 --> 00:45:24.000
have the queen on our $5
bill, is because of this.

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:27.030
And the party hasn't stopped,
by the way in New Orleans,

00:45:27.030 --> 00:45:29.080
because of this ragtag
group of misfits

00:45:29.080 --> 00:45:32.784
that defended that city in that
outrageous, overwhelming odds.

00:45:32.784 --> 00:45:34.950
So Andrew Jackson went on
to become a national hero,

00:45:34.950 --> 00:45:36.750
even though he's kind
of an awful person.

00:45:36.750 --> 00:45:37.860
They didn't have the
internet, so they

00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:39.970
couldn't find out that he
was a racist promise-breaker.

00:45:39.970 --> 00:45:41.594
He stiffed his
contractors, by the way.

00:45:41.594 --> 00:45:43.710
He didn't pay any of
the freemen of color

00:45:43.710 --> 00:45:45.960
even though he promised them.

00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:47.610
But he became president anyway.

00:45:47.610 --> 00:45:50.470
Edward Livingston, Saul Goodman,
became the Secretary of State.

00:45:50.470 --> 00:45:53.500
And John Laffite was pardoned
from all of his previous crimes

00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:54.980
he may have committed.

00:45:54.980 --> 00:45:56.730
So he went from stealing
votes to stealing

00:45:56.730 --> 00:45:58.920
the hearts of New Orleans'
beautiful married ladies.

00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:03.590
He became a man about town,
sort of a local socialite.

00:46:03.590 --> 00:46:05.612
Anyway, the lesson
from this story,

00:46:05.612 --> 00:46:08.070
it's not about Andrew Jackson's
leadership and that speech,

00:46:08.070 --> 00:46:12.540
let's get over our
differences and save the city.

00:46:12.540 --> 00:46:15.150
And it's not exactly about
the British colonel's hubris

00:46:15.150 --> 00:46:17.160
and actually this
really dumb approach

00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:18.870
to fighting this battle.

00:46:18.870 --> 00:46:21.390
But it's that in order
to beat the odds,

00:46:21.390 --> 00:46:23.370
a team of people who are
all good at their jobs

00:46:23.370 --> 00:46:26.070
and unified and
similar is not nearly

00:46:26.070 --> 00:46:28.650
going to be as effective as
a team with the right kinds

00:46:28.650 --> 00:46:31.110
of different ways of thinking
and working together,

00:46:31.110 --> 00:46:33.780
the different perspectives and
heuristics that this ragtag

00:46:33.780 --> 00:46:37.260
army taught each other,
the Choctaw Braves teaching

00:46:37.260 --> 00:46:39.450
the Dirty Shirts how
to do guerrilla war

00:46:39.450 --> 00:46:43.080
and assassinations, which
again this sort of ghastly.

00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:45.540
It was fighting this
like an Indian skirmish.

00:46:45.540 --> 00:46:48.120
It was the pirates
and their cannons

00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:50.100
and the freemen of
color all combining

00:46:50.100 --> 00:46:52.950
their different points
of view on war that

00:46:52.950 --> 00:46:54.480
helped them win this battle.

00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:56.610
And of course, war is
fought very differently now,

00:46:56.610 --> 00:47:00.741
but at the time, this was very
innovative and groundbreaking.

00:47:00.741 --> 00:47:03.240
So when Andrew Jackson says,
let's set aside our differences

00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:05.584
and fight this
battle, he might say

00:47:05.584 --> 00:47:07.500
or we might say some
things are more important

00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:10.470
than our differences, saving
the city, our superordinate goal

00:47:10.470 --> 00:47:11.799
that we're trying to achieve.

00:47:11.799 --> 00:47:13.590
But I think this is an
example of something

00:47:13.590 --> 00:47:15.120
that we all deep
down really know.

00:47:15.120 --> 00:47:17.610
Maybe the important
thing is our differences,

00:47:17.610 --> 00:47:18.870
and we should lean into that.

00:47:18.870 --> 00:47:20.370
So that's what I got.

00:47:20.370 --> 00:47:21.850
Thank you very much.

00:47:21.850 --> 00:47:24.539
And I would love to answer any
questions with any little time

00:47:24.539 --> 00:47:25.080
we have left.

00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:26.177
And thank you.

00:47:26.177 --> 00:47:30.650
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:35.140 --> 00:47:36.430
Is that the microphone?

00:47:36.430 --> 00:47:37.480
AUDIENCE: It is, yes.

00:47:37.480 --> 00:47:40.610
So I guess I'll ask the
first question then.

00:47:40.610 --> 00:47:43.580
Something that I've always
thought about is this--

00:47:43.580 --> 00:47:45.610
and first of all, thank
you for coming by.

00:47:45.610 --> 00:47:47.590
Always a pleasure.

00:47:47.590 --> 00:47:50.699
In regards to the
culture, I kind of

00:47:50.699 --> 00:47:52.990
feel like it's kind of a
contradiction, because we say,

00:47:52.990 --> 00:47:55.810
hey, Eric, bring
yourself and everything

00:47:55.810 --> 00:47:58.600
you are to our company, but
then adapt to this culture.

00:47:58.600 --> 00:48:02.030
So how do you navigate
that acclimation period?

00:48:02.030 --> 00:48:04.960
SHANE SNOW: Yeah, I think
that culture fit is actually

00:48:04.960 --> 00:48:08.050
a fairly poisonous concept.

00:48:08.050 --> 00:48:11.470
So there's research in the '70s
that they did that basically

00:48:11.470 --> 00:48:13.900
determined that
we're the most happy

00:48:13.900 --> 00:48:16.990
at work when we work with people
who have our same personality.

00:48:16.990 --> 00:48:19.180
And for 40 years,
we've of conflated that

00:48:19.180 --> 00:48:21.130
with being productive
and being good

00:48:21.130 --> 00:48:22.480
at solving problems together.

00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:24.229
Turns out that having
the same personality

00:48:24.229 --> 00:48:26.530
is actually not very
good for becoming smarter

00:48:26.530 --> 00:48:28.570
than the smartest
person in your group.

00:48:28.570 --> 00:48:31.200
And being happy at work
actually can be at odds

00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:33.700
with the thing that helps, which
is that cognitive friction.

00:48:33.700 --> 00:48:35.080
So I think that
culture fit is actually

00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:36.750
one of those things that
sounds like a good idea,

00:48:36.750 --> 00:48:37.460
because we want to be happy.

00:48:37.460 --> 00:48:38.230
We want to be comfortable.

00:48:38.230 --> 00:48:39.230
We want to have peace.

00:48:39.230 --> 00:48:41.510
But it's actually the
intellectual battle

00:48:41.510 --> 00:48:44.512
that helps us to stretch
and to become better.

00:48:44.512 --> 00:48:45.970
So I mean, I think
that culture add

00:48:45.970 --> 00:48:47.740
is actually the thing that
we should be talking about,

00:48:47.740 --> 00:48:49.990
and lots of people are
starting to talk about this.

00:48:49.990 --> 00:48:51.850
But there is this
question of what

00:48:51.850 --> 00:48:54.880
do we need to be
unified around, right?

00:48:54.880 --> 00:48:57.310
If we lean into the
thing that, hey,

00:48:57.310 --> 00:48:59.994
bringing different things that
are unique to the group is

00:48:59.994 --> 00:49:01.660
actually what's going
to help the group,

00:49:01.660 --> 00:49:03.868
if we combine in the right
ways and have the humility

00:49:03.868 --> 00:49:06.340
and all that, but then what
keeps that group together?

00:49:06.340 --> 00:49:08.920
And like in this story,
there was this purpose

00:49:08.920 --> 00:49:11.800
that everyone had,
which was this land

00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:12.872
that we want to protect.

00:49:12.872 --> 00:49:15.080
Sort of like the aliens show
up to destroy the Earth,

00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:17.150
we forget about our
borders, that sort of thing.

00:49:17.150 --> 00:49:19.291
We don't always have
that in a company.

00:49:19.291 --> 00:49:21.040
But ideally, you do
have a purpose of what

00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:22.206
you're trying to accomplish.

00:49:22.206 --> 00:49:26.654
I think Google has done really
well when the core values list

00:49:26.654 --> 00:49:27.820
was basically don't be evil.

00:49:27.820 --> 00:49:31.120
It's like, no duh, like
don't do wrong things.

00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:34.155
And then everyone at Google for
years and years could recite,

00:49:34.155 --> 00:49:36.280
our mission is to organize
the world's information.

00:49:36.280 --> 00:49:38.470
That's a pretty good purpose
that if you're actually

00:49:38.470 --> 00:49:42.340
down with and you leave
that path to getting there

00:49:42.340 --> 00:49:45.304
as flexible as possible,
then it allows room

00:49:45.304 --> 00:49:46.720
to be that sort
of band of misfits

00:49:46.720 --> 00:49:48.160
as long as you're
trying to do that.

00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:49.910
I think that purpose
is way more important

00:49:49.910 --> 00:49:53.170
than like lists of behaviors
we want everyone to do, right?

00:49:53.170 --> 00:49:56.440
And so I think to
some degree, Google

00:49:56.440 --> 00:49:58.570
is a very good example
of having done that right

00:49:58.570 --> 00:49:59.680
for many, many years.

00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:02.270
Obviously no company is perfect,
and there's lots of stuff.

00:50:02.270 --> 00:50:06.190
But I think the tendency we
have to say, great, you're

00:50:06.190 --> 00:50:11.386
new to the group, we value you
being here, now be like this,

00:50:11.386 --> 00:50:13.510
it just squashes the benefit
that we get out of it.

00:50:13.510 --> 00:50:14.950
It's like telling people
to get off the mountain

00:50:14.950 --> 00:50:16.220
and go on the other side.

00:50:16.220 --> 00:50:17.080
So I think that's
something important

00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:18.163
that we should talk about.

00:50:18.163 --> 00:50:21.090
At my company, we actually
banned the word culture fit.

00:50:21.090 --> 00:50:23.950
Any time someone said it,
we would use it as a--

00:50:23.950 --> 00:50:26.362
we would sort of pause any
meeting and say, all right,

00:50:26.362 --> 00:50:28.940
let's talk about how
we're not going to fit.

00:50:28.940 --> 00:50:31.150
And I think that's actually
kind of important, easier

00:50:31.150 --> 00:50:33.057
said than done,
but anyway, yeah.

00:50:33.057 --> 00:50:33.890
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:50:38.314 --> 00:50:40.105
SHANE SNOW: I sort of
like this microphone.

00:50:40.105 --> 00:50:41.137
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:50:41.137 --> 00:50:42.595
What's the difference
between like,

00:50:42.595 --> 00:50:47.740
I guess you said the poison of
culture fit versus you learning

00:50:47.740 --> 00:50:50.770
because you don't know anything
about the corporate life,

00:50:50.770 --> 00:50:53.680
like getting used to something
because you're learning it

00:50:53.680 --> 00:50:56.250
versus you keeping
with yourself?

00:50:56.250 --> 00:51:00.850
SHANE SNOW: Yeah, so you know
that whole mountain-range

00:51:00.850 --> 00:51:02.150
cartoon diagram?

00:51:02.150 --> 00:51:04.660
It also applies inside of
our own heads, too, right?

00:51:04.660 --> 00:51:07.600
As we learn, as we gain
experiences and education

00:51:07.600 --> 00:51:09.730
and work different
places, we're collecting

00:51:09.730 --> 00:51:11.771
potentially different
perspectives and heuristics

00:51:11.771 --> 00:51:13.720
that we can tap into.

00:51:13.720 --> 00:51:16.150
So even in your own work,
it is valuable, I think,

00:51:16.150 --> 00:51:17.816
to explore as much
of the mountain range

00:51:17.816 --> 00:51:18.880
as possible, right?

00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:20.890
So I think being curious
about things even

00:51:20.890 --> 00:51:24.230
if you don't find them useful
can actually be really good.

00:51:24.230 --> 00:51:26.020
You can draw lessons from them.

00:51:26.020 --> 00:51:29.940
Einstein was notoriously sort
of a loner when he did his work.

00:51:29.940 --> 00:51:32.440
He had like this rival that
pushed him, Niels Bohr.

00:51:32.440 --> 00:51:36.004
But he had a really diverse
set of inputs into his process.

00:51:36.004 --> 00:51:37.420
He was in a patent
office learning

00:51:37.420 --> 00:51:39.982
about all these different kinds
of industries and inventions.

00:51:39.982 --> 00:51:40.690
Certainly helped.

00:51:40.690 --> 00:51:42.100
And he was curious about them.

00:51:42.100 --> 00:51:44.440
But he also played the violin,
he was really into drama.

00:51:44.440 --> 00:51:49.840
Those things all helped broaden
his potential zone of friction

00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:51.130
inside his own head.

00:51:51.130 --> 00:51:53.704
So I think you're new
to an organization,

00:51:53.704 --> 00:51:55.870
actually learning how the
organization does function

00:51:55.870 --> 00:51:58.750
is really important,
but resisting the urge

00:51:58.750 --> 00:52:02.500
to have to fit and realizing
that if the organization is

00:52:02.500 --> 00:52:04.540
smart, even if
it's not, what you

00:52:04.540 --> 00:52:07.480
can bring that's outside of
the normal way of thinking

00:52:07.480 --> 00:52:10.240
to provoke new ways of thinking,
even if what you're bringing

00:52:10.240 --> 00:52:11.187
is not the best.

00:52:11.187 --> 00:52:12.520
You're on a lower mountain peak.

00:52:12.520 --> 00:52:14.256
Whatever you're
bringing can help

00:52:14.256 --> 00:52:15.380
explore more of that range.

00:52:15.380 --> 00:52:16.720
So I think that's important.

00:52:16.720 --> 00:52:19.000
In the book I have
a couple of chapters

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:21.580
about that idea of what
often looks crazy or useless

00:52:21.580 --> 00:52:24.580
can actually be really helpful
in solving problems, which

00:52:24.580 --> 00:52:26.890
is an excuse for
including people who

00:52:26.890 --> 00:52:29.890
are more novices
in a deliberation

00:52:29.890 --> 00:52:32.200
process or
problem-solving process.

00:52:32.200 --> 00:52:34.060
With the cops thing,
there's research

00:52:34.060 --> 00:52:36.390
about how when you put an
old cop with a young cop,

00:52:36.390 --> 00:52:38.500
sort of like a buddy
cop movie thing,

00:52:38.500 --> 00:52:40.600
that that partnership
will do better,

00:52:40.600 --> 00:52:43.440
just like when you put a male
cop and a female cop together.

00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:47.110
All cops tend to have a
different set of perspectives

00:52:47.110 --> 00:52:50.260
and heuristics, and new cops
tend to have a little bit more

00:52:50.260 --> 00:52:53.950
of that either no, we
gotta do it by the book

00:52:53.950 --> 00:52:55.780
or, well, why do we
have to do it that way?

00:52:55.780 --> 00:52:58.129
And that actually helps
with that process.

00:52:58.129 --> 00:52:59.920
Anyway, I'm kind of
rambling at this point,

00:52:59.920 --> 00:53:03.940
but I think all this stuff
as a pragmatic excuse

00:53:03.940 --> 00:53:05.930
for doing what's the
right thing to do,

00:53:05.930 --> 00:53:09.130
which is including people in--

00:53:09.130 --> 00:53:11.320
the more different
kinds of people

00:53:11.320 --> 00:53:13.990
that we have working on things,
the better chance we have

00:53:13.990 --> 00:53:15.081
of breaking through.

00:53:15.081 --> 00:53:16.330
It's also a good moral choice.

00:53:19.710 --> 00:53:21.636
Anyone else have a--

00:53:21.636 --> 00:53:22.136
yeah.

00:53:27.340 --> 00:53:31.430
AUDIENCE: So you talked a little
bit about like if you pass--

00:53:31.430 --> 00:53:33.120
you had that graph
where it was like,

00:53:33.120 --> 00:53:36.620
this is the area of destruction.

00:53:36.620 --> 00:53:39.625
Do you have any tips
or recommendations

00:53:39.625 --> 00:53:42.620
for how you prevent
from getting in that?

00:53:42.620 --> 00:53:44.120
I mean, is it
possible that you have

00:53:44.120 --> 00:53:47.210
too much cognitive diversity?

00:53:47.210 --> 00:53:49.850
Or is there other things
that you do recommend

00:53:49.850 --> 00:53:52.250
to not get into that area?

00:53:52.250 --> 00:53:54.390
SHANE SNOW: Yeah,
that's a great question.

00:53:54.390 --> 00:53:58.150
So is it possible to have
too much cognitive diversity?

00:53:58.150 --> 00:54:01.870
You need cognitive
diversity that's relevant.

00:54:01.870 --> 00:54:04.570
So like me being a pizza
driver when I'm age

00:54:04.570 --> 00:54:07.450
16 might actually not be
a relevant perspective

00:54:07.450 --> 00:54:10.600
to solving an algorithm
problem or something.

00:54:10.600 --> 00:54:11.440
It might be.

00:54:11.440 --> 00:54:14.140
You want to set yourself
up so you have the broadest

00:54:14.140 --> 00:54:15.495
array of possibilities.

00:54:15.495 --> 00:54:17.870
But some cognitive diversity
is not going to be relevant.

00:54:17.870 --> 00:54:20.174
And I think often
we make decisions

00:54:20.174 --> 00:54:22.090
on who to include in a
problem-solving process

00:54:22.090 --> 00:54:25.690
or on a team based on who was
on the team last or who's here,

00:54:25.690 --> 00:54:27.820
who's available,
or what's obvious.

00:54:27.820 --> 00:54:31.330
And I do think that
there's a very good excuse

00:54:31.330 --> 00:54:34.587
to include wildcards
and you should always

00:54:34.587 --> 00:54:36.920
include people who are going
to be affected by solutions

00:54:36.920 --> 00:54:38.687
to problems and all that.

00:54:38.687 --> 00:54:41.270
But you can have too many people
sitting around a table coming

00:54:41.270 --> 00:54:42.590
up with ideas, right?

00:54:42.590 --> 00:54:45.350
It's actually more
ideal to have a series

00:54:45.350 --> 00:54:48.156
of one-on-one processes
when you can amp up

00:54:48.156 --> 00:54:50.780
the debate and the friction with
different people and it's safe

00:54:50.780 --> 00:54:52.110
and all that.

00:54:52.110 --> 00:54:53.611
But the other
thing that you were

00:54:53.611 --> 00:54:55.610
asking about getting out
of the destruction zone

00:54:55.610 --> 00:54:58.550
or avoiding that,
usually the problem

00:54:58.550 --> 00:55:02.180
that most organizations have is
that you're so afraid of that

00:55:02.180 --> 00:55:03.320
that you pipe down.

00:55:03.320 --> 00:55:04.074
You quiet up.

00:55:04.074 --> 00:55:05.990
You have what's called
organizational silence.

00:55:05.990 --> 00:55:08.300
This is what kills mergers and
marriages and everything, is

00:55:08.300 --> 00:55:10.549
when you stop talking about
things that are important,

00:55:10.549 --> 00:55:12.660
because you're afraid
of the conflict.

00:55:12.660 --> 00:55:15.670
But there's a few things, and
I get into this in the book.

00:55:15.670 --> 00:55:17.840
There's a couple
of things that are

00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:22.040
easy to do to reduce the
tension in our relationship

00:55:22.040 --> 00:55:24.380
between people that have a
lot of cognitive diversity

00:55:24.380 --> 00:55:27.980
and maybe that have fear of
their differences in general.

00:55:27.980 --> 00:55:29.270
One of them is playing.

00:55:29.270 --> 00:55:32.810
So it turns out that
play and humor simulates

00:55:32.810 --> 00:55:34.970
the situation of anxiety.

00:55:34.970 --> 00:55:37.190
But your brain knows
when you're playing

00:55:37.190 --> 00:55:39.270
or when there's a joke
that it's not real

00:55:39.270 --> 00:55:40.820
and it's not actually dangerous.

00:55:40.820 --> 00:55:42.920
And so if you play
with a group of people,

00:55:42.920 --> 00:55:47.240
you'll end up putting them in
your psychological in-group

00:55:47.240 --> 00:55:48.410
after a while.

00:55:48.410 --> 00:55:51.470
And they've done all sorts
of experiments in this.

00:55:51.470 --> 00:55:53.420
Another thing that
I'm personally

00:55:53.420 --> 00:55:56.210
really passionate
about is storytelling.

00:55:56.210 --> 00:55:57.680
The neuroscience
of storytelling is

00:55:57.680 --> 00:56:02.900
something that has been recently
dove into by neuroeconomists.

00:56:02.900 --> 00:56:06.560
Basically the summary is when
you learn someone's story,

00:56:06.560 --> 00:56:09.830
especially you learn something
vulnerable and emotional,

00:56:09.830 --> 00:56:11.630
an emotion that you
can identify with,

00:56:11.630 --> 00:56:13.700
your brain generates
oxytocin, which

00:56:13.700 --> 00:56:16.280
is the empathy drug, which
makes you care about them.

00:56:16.280 --> 00:56:18.080
And they've done
tons of experiments

00:56:18.080 --> 00:56:19.250
that basically show--

00:56:19.250 --> 00:56:20.690
and some companies
like BlackRock

00:56:20.690 --> 00:56:24.064
have actually incorporated
this into a corporate setting.

00:56:24.064 --> 00:56:25.480
If you and I don't
know each other

00:56:25.480 --> 00:56:27.620
and maybe for
whatever reason we're

00:56:27.620 --> 00:56:30.680
nervous about each other's very
different ideas or perspectives

00:56:30.680 --> 00:56:34.910
or I grew up in a place where
you would be scared of me,

00:56:34.910 --> 00:56:38.840
if I learn your story, then
I'll become more comfortable,

00:56:38.840 --> 00:56:41.870
and we can actually have more
of that cognitive friction

00:56:41.870 --> 00:56:44.042
between us, and it's safe.

00:56:44.042 --> 00:56:46.250
So you build trust through
learning people's stories.

00:56:46.250 --> 00:56:48.350
And you know that thing
in the "New York Times"

00:56:48.350 --> 00:56:49.808
a couple of years
ago where it said

00:56:49.808 --> 00:56:52.730
to fall in love with anyone, ask
each other these 30 questions?

00:56:52.730 --> 00:56:53.820
Anyone see that?

00:56:53.820 --> 00:56:56.180
This is a really a popular
story that basically is like,

00:56:56.180 --> 00:56:58.340
if you go through these 30
questions with a stranger,

00:56:58.340 --> 00:57:00.048
you will basically
fall in love with them

00:57:00.048 --> 00:57:03.830
or you'll be much more likely
to have feelings for them.

00:57:03.830 --> 00:57:05.330
All of those questions
are basically

00:57:05.330 --> 00:57:07.700
asking you a series of
increasingly vulnerable stories

00:57:07.700 --> 00:57:09.659
about yourself, what's
the last time you cried?

00:57:09.659 --> 00:57:11.325
What's something that
you wish you would

00:57:11.325 --> 00:57:12.500
have done in your childhood?

00:57:12.500 --> 00:57:14.930
You can't share those kinds
of stories with people

00:57:14.930 --> 00:57:18.330
without developing
empathy and trust.

00:57:18.330 --> 00:57:20.810
And that allows
you to go further

00:57:20.810 --> 00:57:23.380
in your intellectual
battle without it devolving

00:57:23.380 --> 00:57:24.380
into something personal.

00:57:24.380 --> 00:57:26.390
The Wright brothers,
they loved each other,

00:57:26.390 --> 00:57:29.485
and they knew each other
and had this deep affection

00:57:29.485 --> 00:57:30.110
for each other.

00:57:30.110 --> 00:57:31.700
It allowed them to go further.

00:57:31.700 --> 00:57:34.790
So things like that are
psychological tricks

00:57:34.790 --> 00:57:36.590
that you can do.

00:57:36.590 --> 00:57:39.440
Easier to do in a team setting,
in a small group of people,

00:57:39.440 --> 00:57:41.702
or in a company then in like
society like on Facebook

00:57:41.702 --> 00:57:43.160
or like, hey, let's
all play a game

00:57:43.160 --> 00:57:45.770
so we can stop arguing about
Democrats versus Republicans.

00:57:45.770 --> 00:57:47.570
Like that's a little bit harder.

00:57:47.570 --> 00:57:52.230
But there's some real power
to learning people's stories.

00:57:52.230 --> 00:57:54.062
But, yeah, I mean,
that's basically

00:57:54.062 --> 00:57:55.520
the game that's
afoot, is how do we

00:57:55.520 --> 00:57:57.984
keep our relationships
in that zone

00:57:57.984 --> 00:57:59.150
without it getting personal?

00:58:02.012 --> 00:58:04.530
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
Do you hear me?

00:58:04.530 --> 00:58:07.120
OK, so speaking of
stories, I really

00:58:07.120 --> 00:58:10.120
love the way you started with
a story and put everything

00:58:10.120 --> 00:58:11.050
in that context.

00:58:11.050 --> 00:58:12.054
SHANE SNOW: Thanks.

00:58:12.054 --> 00:58:14.470
AUDIENCE: Wanted to ask you
about that crucial step, which

00:58:14.470 --> 00:58:17.791
is people need to
be flexible and be

00:58:17.791 --> 00:58:20.290
able to change their opinion
in order for progress to exist.

00:58:20.290 --> 00:58:23.230
So what would you
recommend doing in a set-up

00:58:23.230 --> 00:58:26.457
where do you see that there is
resistance from certain people

00:58:26.457 --> 00:58:27.790
that they don't want to do that?

00:58:27.790 --> 00:58:29.090
And then what do you do?

00:58:29.090 --> 00:58:30.714
SHANE SNOW: Yeah, so
I think if there's

00:58:30.714 --> 00:58:32.560
one skill everyone
in the world could

00:58:32.560 --> 00:58:35.200
learn that would make everything
better, like all of work

00:58:35.200 --> 00:58:38.567
and all of society, it would
be intellectual humility.

00:58:38.567 --> 00:58:40.150
And intellectual
humility is something

00:58:40.150 --> 00:58:42.316
that philosophers have
talked about for a long time,

00:58:42.316 --> 00:58:43.900
but it's only in
2017 that we could

00:58:43.900 --> 00:58:46.904
actually-- we had an
assessment for measuring

00:58:46.904 --> 00:58:47.820
intellectual humility.

00:58:47.820 --> 00:58:50.600
And it breaks down
to a few categories.

00:58:50.600 --> 00:58:52.480
So if you go to
shanesnow.com/IH,

00:58:52.480 --> 00:58:56.110
you can take the actual test
that they developed and see

00:58:56.110 --> 00:58:58.580
what areas you need to improve.

00:58:58.580 --> 00:59:01.250
So for me, separating my ego
from my intellect is very hard.

00:59:01.250 --> 00:59:03.130
If you convince me
I'm wrong, I will

00:59:03.130 --> 00:59:06.440
be more likely than the average
person to revise my viewpoint.

00:59:06.440 --> 00:59:08.800
But it will hurt
bad, so that makes

00:59:08.800 --> 00:59:11.530
me harder to collaborate with.

00:59:11.530 --> 00:59:12.874
So that's one thing.

00:59:12.874 --> 00:59:14.290
If you're dealing
with someone who

00:59:14.290 --> 00:59:15.970
you know is going
to be resistant,

00:59:15.970 --> 00:59:17.680
there's a few tricks.

00:59:17.680 --> 00:59:22.090
You want to prime them to not
get into personal battle mode

00:59:22.090 --> 00:59:24.280
and to be in more
intellectual battle mode.

00:59:24.280 --> 00:59:26.740
My favorite thing of
late is Ben Franklin

00:59:26.740 --> 00:59:28.536
had this trick that he would do.

00:59:28.536 --> 00:59:30.160
He knew most the time
he's the smartest

00:59:30.160 --> 00:59:31.420
person he's interacting with.

00:59:31.420 --> 00:59:32.920
But he also knew
that he's not going

00:59:32.920 --> 00:59:36.250
to get better if he acted that
way and that he could be wrong.

00:59:36.250 --> 00:59:38.587
So when he was going to express
an argument of something

00:59:38.587 --> 00:59:41.170
that he felt very strongly about
or tried to persuade someone,

00:59:41.170 --> 00:59:43.790
he'd always start
with, I could be wrong,

00:59:43.790 --> 00:59:46.310
but-- and then he'd hit
him with the argument.

00:59:46.310 --> 00:59:48.700
And what it does is
it primes that person

00:59:48.700 --> 00:59:50.530
to feel like it's not
going to be personal

00:59:50.530 --> 00:59:51.961
if they prove you wrong.

00:59:51.961 --> 00:59:54.460
And they're less on their heels
when you start the argument.

00:59:54.460 --> 00:59:57.670
He'd also shy away from using
absolutes, like it's always

00:59:57.670 --> 00:59:59.450
or it's certainly or whatever.

00:59:59.450 --> 01:00:02.380
So there's always
room for change.

01:00:02.380 --> 01:00:06.700
But for him, it helped because
if you proved him wrong,

01:00:06.700 --> 01:00:07.592
he was still right.

01:00:07.592 --> 01:00:09.550
He could tell his ego,
I said I could be wrong,

01:00:09.550 --> 01:00:11.800
and I was, so I'm right.

01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:14.740
And there's stuff
like that you can do.

01:00:14.740 --> 01:00:18.029
I just wrote a post
in my newsletter--

01:00:18.029 --> 01:00:19.570
you can go to my
website and see it--

01:00:19.570 --> 01:00:22.660
about a few other strategies
for that sort of thing,

01:00:22.660 --> 01:00:24.180
keeping your identity small.

01:00:24.180 --> 01:00:27.220
What are things that you can do
to not bring your personal ego

01:00:27.220 --> 01:00:29.830
and identity into conversation.

01:00:29.830 --> 01:00:32.870
It's hard to force
someone else to do that.

01:00:32.870 --> 01:00:34.750
But the more that
you can get them

01:00:34.750 --> 01:00:38.440
to see you as a human being and
separate your ideas from who

01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:41.219
you are and see that
you're doing that with them

01:00:41.219 --> 01:00:43.510
and that you're allowing them
the opportunity to change

01:00:43.510 --> 01:00:45.659
your mind, that often rubs off.

01:00:45.659 --> 01:00:47.200
Some people are not
going to do that,

01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:48.730
and then you've got to
question, are they the kind

01:00:48.730 --> 01:00:50.100
of people you want
to collaborate?

01:00:50.100 --> 01:00:51.975
Maybe you just consult
them, get their input,

01:00:51.975 --> 01:00:53.639
but you don't actually
work with them.

01:00:53.639 --> 01:00:55.430
But there's a lot of
work to be done there.

01:00:55.430 --> 01:00:58.990
But I that's the big challenge
that leaders have nowadays.

01:00:58.990 --> 01:01:01.490
We have this idea of the
leader as the strong one who

01:01:01.490 --> 01:01:04.610
doesn't change, that can take
the bullets and lead the army

01:01:04.610 --> 01:01:05.110
or whatever.

01:01:05.110 --> 01:01:06.730
The best leaders
are the ones that

01:01:06.730 --> 01:01:09.140
are going to be willing
to change their minds

01:01:09.140 --> 01:01:13.074
and to be humble, basically,
and not say, I'm the greatest

01:01:13.074 --> 01:01:14.740
and I'm always right,
even though that's

01:01:14.740 --> 01:01:17.240
the kind of people that we
tend to think of as leaders,

01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:20.050
because that's who would help
us beat the saber tooth tigers

01:01:20.050 --> 01:01:21.217
or whatever back in the day.

01:01:21.217 --> 01:01:23.258
So, yeah, there's a lot
of work to be done there.

01:01:23.258 --> 01:01:24.740
But I think that's
super important.

01:01:24.740 --> 01:01:26.990
Thank you so much for coming
in and listening to this.

01:01:26.990 --> 01:01:29.550
And if you end up cracking
open the book and reading it,

01:01:29.550 --> 01:01:31.330
go to my website and tell
me what you thought of it.

01:01:31.330 --> 01:01:31.930
Thank you.

01:01:31.930 --> 01:01:35.880
