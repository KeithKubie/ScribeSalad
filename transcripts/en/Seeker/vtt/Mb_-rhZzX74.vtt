00:00:00.109 --> 00:00:01.900
When I die, I want to
be stuffed and turned

00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:04.180
into a robot on the Pirates
of the Caribbean ride.

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:05.510
You cannot actually do that.

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:06.750
But there are some
other awesome things

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.420
you can do with
your own dead body.

00:00:14.036 --> 00:00:16.990
Anthony here for D News,
and why just get buried.

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:18.010
That is boring.

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:21.750
And also as the population grows
and land becomes more valuable,

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.440
getting buried in a cemetery
is just sort of wasteful.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:26.980
There just isn't space for them.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.070
About 76 million Americans
will hit life expectancy

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:31.570
in the next 10
years, and it's going

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.640
to take a space the size of
Las Vegas to bury them all.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.880
There is not room for
this kind of stuff.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.820
Even in countries like England,
where 70% of the population

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.950
is cremated, things
are getting tight.

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.400
Plus, the human body
is full of all kinds

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.830
of amazing useful things,
so as a public service,

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.130
here are the coolest things
you can do with your body

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:50.344
instead of burying it.

00:00:50.344 --> 00:00:51.760
You've got a lot
of carbon in you.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:52.650
All living things do.

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.460
You just so happen to be
about 18% to 24% carbon.

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.460
So why not get yourself
turned into a diamond?

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.490
A company like LifeGem
will use chemicals

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:04.390
to extract the carbon from your
ashes, turn it into graphite,

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.390
and then throw it into a chamber
that mimics the intense heat

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.650
and pressure at the
center of the Earth.

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.330
And in a couple weeks, boom!

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:12.520
You're a precious gem.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.970
I mean, as far as I'm
concerned, you already were.

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.240
But now you are literally.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.440
So what now?

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.510
Well, you could be
the ghost inside

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:20.990
of a haunted ring,
which is cool.

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.540
Or you could potentially be
part of an nanoscopic MRI

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.950
or a quantum computer.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.560
UC Santa Barbara
researchers think

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.970
that sheets of synthetic
diamonds patterned

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.240
with nitrogen atoms could make
computers about a million times

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.530
more efficient than silicon.

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.660
And the atomic
impurities of them

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:38.230
might make them the
perfect candidate

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:41.530
to be the building block of tiny
magnetic field detectors which

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.580
could be injected
into the human body

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.450
to allow us more precise
medical scans than ever.

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.090
So just get yourself turned
into a pile of diamonds,

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:50.960
and send yourself to
the nearest college.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.020
Does that sound too
pedestrian, too useful?

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.570
How about just shooting
your ashes into space?

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.540
For $2,000, Elysium Space will
launch a vial of your cremated

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.290
remains off into
the final frontier.

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:04.420
The company was founded
by an ex-NASA employee,

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.602
and the cost
includes a mobile app

00:02:06.602 --> 00:02:08.060
that will let your
loved ones track

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.150
your endless voyage
to the stars.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:11.940
But if you want to
stay closer to home,

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.860
rival company
Celestis will put you

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.887
on a satellite orbiting
the earth for $5,000.

00:02:16.887 --> 00:02:18.470
Now some of you might
be saying, wait,

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.428
if we are trying to save
the Earth's resources,

00:02:20.428 --> 00:02:23.410
why are we buying into something
that takes as much energy

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:24.970
as a spacecraft launch?

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.826
To which I say,
"Spaaaace!" [FADES AWAY]

00:02:28.826 --> 00:02:31.315
But if you're looking to be
carbon neutral even in death,

00:02:31.315 --> 00:02:34.274
maybe you want to die in Sweden,
specifically Halmstad, Sweden.

00:02:34.274 --> 00:02:35.940
When locals wondered
about the pollution

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.320
from the town's
crematorium, city officials

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:39.440
came up with a plan.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.720
Using the furnace
from the crematorium

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.870
to power homes in the town.

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.040
Just a tiny, adorable, little
power plant run on dead people.

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.740
One last way for your
Nissan LEAF-driving friends

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:52.960
to show their superiority
to you before they

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.010
go into the great beyond.

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.620
By the way, my idea of being
stuffed, that is not legal.

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.447
But you can be mummified,
though a sarcophagus

00:02:59.447 --> 00:03:01.530
is going to take up much
more space than a coffin.

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.670
The lovely people of
Summum will do it for you

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.674
for the sum of $67,000.

00:03:05.674 --> 00:03:07.590
You know, you would think
for that much money,

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:08.964
they can afford
a better website.

00:03:08.964 --> 00:03:11.785
I am still undecided, other
than being an organ donor.

00:03:11.785 --> 00:03:13.910
What do you want to do with
your body when you die?

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:14.730
Let me know down below.

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.313

to an article from the Discovery

00:03:17.313 --> 00:03:21.050
News blog with even more
ideas for dead bodies.
