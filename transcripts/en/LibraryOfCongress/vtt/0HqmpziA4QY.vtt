00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:24.830 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Alex Young from NASA Goddard.

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.870
And he's going to talk about
the total solar eclipse of 2017.

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:31.110
And I need say no more, let's go.

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:32.410
&gt;&gt; Dr. C. Alex Young: Okay.

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:33.710
So thank you for your patience.

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.280 position:56%
I apologize for getting stuck in
traffic, especially given that I was

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.540
at NASA headquarters,
which is almost walking --

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.500
well, it is walking
distance, really, so.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.200
And I have visitors from
NASA headquarters here

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.840
from the planetary division,
solar system exploration.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.570
So it's great to see you guys here.

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.770
So thanks, everyone, for coming.

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.140 position:56%
As I said, I tend to move around, so
I have to force myself to stay still

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.440
because they're videotaping.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.090
So I'm going to stay right here.

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.020
But what I'm going to talk
about today is something coming

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:09.630
up this summer, August
21st, total solar eclipse.

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.710
And I want to give you some of the
perspective from NASA's viewpoint,

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.970
but all in all, this
is not a NASA event.

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.170
NASA's very used to
having their own launch

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.620
and things they have control over.

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:29.060
This is nature's event, and
NASA's just along for the ride.

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.570
But I want to give you some of the
things that are important to NASA

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.210
and that NASA's really just
trying to share to the public.

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.380
But all in all, this
is for everyone.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.390
And the good thing is that
everyone can experience this

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.600
in some form or another.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.390
Before I go forward, this is what
I'd like to do, is ask everyone

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.360
to imagine looking at this
blank slide; what do you think

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.450
about when you think about the sun?

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.610
On a daily basis, what comes to
mind when you think about the sun?

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:59.910
&gt;&gt; Hot.

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:01.210
&gt;&gt; Dr. C. Alex Young: Hot?

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:02.750
So maybe something
like this, you know?

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.320
Maybe a nice sunrise
or a nice sunset.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.590
Or maybe even this, it's actually
so bright, it's hard to look at.

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.340
Even if you put a camera up, you
don't really see a whole lot.

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.720
You know, if you're lucky
enough to have a telescope,

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.250
then maybe you'll see something a
little more interesting like this.

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.910
So here you see these
objects called sunspots.

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.010
Just to give you some perspective,

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.840
these are the size of
the earth or bigger.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.150
Okay? So the sun is
really, really big.

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.850
But the only other thing
you really get from this is

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.220
that you can see the sun rotate,

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.780
which is something
we don't really get

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.430
from our perspective
here on the ground.

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.910
Other than it moves in the sky, we
don't actually see that it rotates.

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.970
But this is actually
kind of boring, okay?

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.820
This not too exciting.

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:56.020 position:56%
But what's going to happen on August
21st of this year is that if you're

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:03.510
in the right place, you're going
to see the sun slowly disappear --

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.590
looks like a Pac-Man for those
of us that remember Pac-Man --

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.750
as the moon moves in front of it.

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.800
And eventually you're going to
see it completely disappear.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:20.450
And all of a sudden, this is
going to be replaced by it.

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.200
Instead of the bright disc of the
sun, the thing that we can't look

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.000
at with our own eyes, if
you're in the right place --

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.750 position:56%
and I'll talk more about what I mean

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.610
by the right place --
this is what you see.

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:37.150
You see the outer atmosphere
of the sun.

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.940
It's incredibly dynamic.

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.580
It's wispy, sort of ethereal.

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.630
You can even see these features
at the top that are red.

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:47.870
These are things that you
can see with your own eyes.

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:55.590
And this is the sun that we know
really well, especially from space.

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.340
And it's an opportunity
during a total solar eclipse

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:03.050
to see the dynamic sun
from the ground in a way

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:07.800
that we cannot see even
with the most sophisticated

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.990
and amazing technology.

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:12.860
Nature gives us a glimpse
of this part

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:18.440
of the sun that's incredibly
dynamic and has huge implications

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.250
for the science that
we're interested in,

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.520
as well as it actually
has implications

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.840
for even our technological society.

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.900
And I'll talk a little bit more
later about that when I talk

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.730
about the science specific
to the eclipse.

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:36.360
But first, I want to talk a little
bit about what an eclipse is,

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.380
what makes this eclipse
kind of special,

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:47.190
and what actually makes eclipses
special and rare in general.

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:51.670
So one of the things to think about
is what's happening here simply is

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:54.540
that everything is
lined up just right

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.460
that the moon moves
in front of the sun.

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.790
It appears about the same
size as the sun in the sky

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:03.270
because of its location
and its orbit

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.630
and it blocks out the
disc of the sun.

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:08.330
But this doesn't happen
all the time.

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:11.050
It actually happens
during a new moon.

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:15.190
And you might think, "Well,
we get a new moon every month,

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:20.060
so why doesn't this
happen then, okay?"

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:25.210
So we're used to thinking
about in the month we have --

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:29.000
you know, once a month we
see there's a full moon.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.220
You see there's also the new moon.

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:35.220
So why doesn't this
happen all the time?

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:36.830
Why don't we get this every month?

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:38.130
This is another view

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:41.030
of the different phases
of the moon's orbit.

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:44.070
Just to remind you, so
you're sitting on the side

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:48.290
of the earth that's lit
up by the sun, okay,

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:52.850
and there's the new moon --
the moon that is invisible,

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:55.350
you can't see it, from
the night side.

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:57.710
But in the day side that's
actually blocking the sun

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:00.310
out during a total solar eclipse.

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:06.060 position:56%
But one of the things that's special
is that the orbit of the earth

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:09.590
and the sun make what we
call the ecliptic, okay?

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:15.200
But the orbit of the moon around
the earth is actually inclined

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:18.430
by about five degrees.

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:21.650
And so what that means is, is
every time it moves around,

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:23.670
it's not always in that plane.

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:29.970
Sometimes it's a little bit
higher than the plane of the earth

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:32.040
and the sun, and sometimes
it's a little bit lower.

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:34.830
So this is what you see.

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:38.810
Sometimes you get the situation
like the top where it's

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:42.020
above the earth or
also below the earth.

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:45.200
And so this shadow
that's cast by the sun --

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:47.540
I'm sorry, by the moon
from the sun shining

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:50.530
on it is actually not
hitting the earth.

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:54.080
But there's a special time
when you actually have

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.320
that shadow that's
cast on the earth.

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:59.960
And that's what's happening
during an eclipse.

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:02.520
But there's also one
other part of it.

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:06.490
Not only is the orbit
of moon inclined,

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:08.960
the orbit's actually not a circle.

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:12.500
So sometimes it's a little bit
farther away from the earth,

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:14.870
sometimes it's a little bit closer.

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:20.720
So it has an elliptical orbit, a
football sort of shape or oval.

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:23.890
And so I won't go into
a lot of detail,

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:27.890
but what that actually also means
is even when the shadow is lined

00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:30.210
up just right, there are times

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:35.880
when the moon is actually
farther from the earth.

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:38.820
And so it actually is not
the same size as the sun,

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:40.620
it's a little bit smaller
than the sun.

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:43.500
And so in fact, you get an
eclipse but you get a type

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:45.850
of eclipse called an
annular eclipse.

00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:49.840
So you see this ring of
fire people often call it

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:52.730
around the edge of the moon.

00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:57.250
But we're interested in
the case where it's closer

00:07:57.250 --> 00:08:00.970 position:56%
and it completely blocks out the sun
-- that's the total solar eclipse.

00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:03.650
So that's the special
one that we want to see.

00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:07.700
So what's going to
happen on the 21st?

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:10.320
So we're looking from
behind the moon.

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:15.530
And you can see that there's
a shadow cast from the moon.

00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:21.520
And that dark circle
is called the umbra --

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:24.380
that's the dark center
of the shadow.

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:29.650
And if you're in that path where
that dark circle travels from,

00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:34.160
starting in Oregon, all the way
across down to South Carolina,

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:37.950
you will see a total solar eclipse.

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:43.850
But everyone in North
America, Central America,

00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:48.350
and a portion of South America is
going to be in that bigger circle

00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:50.620
around it -- we call
that the penumbra --

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:53.740
and that's where it's
partially blocked

00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:56.760
and you'll still see
a partial eclipse.

00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:02.500
So everyone in the United
States, North America, Central,

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:05.120
and part of South America
is going to see

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:07.270
at least a partial solar eclipse.

00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:11.080
And that includes here.

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:15.970
So, again, here's kind of this
series of what you would see.

00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:18.070
There's the partial eclipse,

00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:21.870
the moon slowly moving
in front of the sun.

00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:25.590
Just before we get to
what we call totality

00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:29.270
where the moon is completely
blocking out the sun,

00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:32.780
light will shine through
the edges of the moon.

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:37.560
So the moon is actually not a
nice, smooth sphere; but in fact,

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:40.670
it has mountains and craters.

00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:43.790
And one of the things that we
actually have been able to do

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:48.190
with technology from NASA using
the LRO spacecraft is actually map

00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:52.880
out that surface in
incredible detail to allow us

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:55.740
to see what's going to
be cast on the earth.

00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:59.240
Because it turns out that it's
actually not a simple circle

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:03.940
or even an oval, but in fact, it's
actually a complicated polygon.

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:09.160
So it's crazy, the shadow actually
has, you know, sharp edges.

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:12.380
Something that when
people first simulated it,

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:13.680
didn't actually believe it.

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:15.830
They thought the computers
were lying to them,

00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:17.130
that they were seeing errors.

00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:21.350
But in fact, it's because the
moon has all this structure

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:22.650
around the edge.

00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:24.790
And so when the sun
is shining behind it,

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:28.820
light is shining through
those valleys.

00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:34.120 position:56%
And that's what happens right before
totality, you get this glimpse

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:40.040 position:56%
of a flash, often called the diamond
ring or even the engagement ring.

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:42.060
Sometimes you'll see
several of them,

00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:43.650
which are called Bailey's beads.

00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:49.000 position:56%
And that's when the light is shining
through the valleys on the moon.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.350
So here's another perspective.

00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:53.650
This is the shadow.

00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:58.660 position:56%
So I'm showing you across the
country you're seeing as the shadow,

00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:02.920
as the umbra is moving, that
shows you how partiality --

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:05.460
how the partial eclipse
changes across the country.

00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:08.030
Now, of course, where the
partial eclipse disappears,

00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:10.420
that's right where that black
dot is and that's where all

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:12.060
of a sudden you have totality.

00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:18.230
So it starts at around
10:30 local time in Oregon,

00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:24.900
travels across the country at about
1,200 to 1,500 miles per hour.

00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:26.960
It's moving incredibly fast.

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:33.900
It gets to South Carolina just
close to 3:00 p.m. local time.

00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:39.560
And that time period of
totality from coast to coast is

00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:42.160
about an hour and a half.

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:44.630
Now, the partial phase
-- seeing partiality --

00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:46.410
is actually many more hours.

00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:50.930 position:56%
So that's going to last for three to
four hours across the whole country.

00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:54.160
And if you're in that
path, if you happen to be

00:11:54.160 --> 00:12:00.260
in that region we call the path of
totality, it's about 70 miles wide,

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:05.620 position:56%
then you have somewhere between 30
seconds if you're on the edge of it,

00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:09.270
and if you're near the center of it
-- we call that the center line --

00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:13.260
it's going to be about two to
two and a half minutes roughly.

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:16.080 position:56%
So that's how much totality you get.

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:21.010
Okay? And when that happens, this
is kind of what you would see

00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:24.270
from the ground just
looking at the sun.

00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:28.700
Now, I'll emphasize this a
couple of times, and I know many

00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:30.000
of you have probably
heard this many times:

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.550
You should absolutely never
look at the sun with your eyes

00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:36.140
without the proper protection.

00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:39.020
This is especially the
case for everywhere

00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:41.640 position:56%
that there's only a partial eclipse.

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:43.550
Okay? So always remember that.

00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:48.870
The only exception to this is if
you are in the path of totality,

00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:52.960
that brief time period of
half a minute to a couple

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:55.650
of minutes is the only
time you can look

00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:58.170
at the sun with your naked eyes.

00:12:58.170 --> 00:13:00.540
Because you're seeing
the outer corona,

00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:04.380
which is a million times dimmer
than the disc of the sun.

00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:10.490
The sun itself is so incredibly
bright that even when 98% or 99%

00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:14.970
of it is covered by the moon,
it's still too bright to see.

00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:17.670
Okay? It still can do
damage to your eyes.

00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:19.760
I'll talk a little
bit about the ways

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:21.430
in which you can look at it safely.

00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:24.880
But I just want to emphasize that
because that's really paramount --

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:27.100
safety is first and foremost.

00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:29.260
But this is the sequence
you would see.

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:33.840 position:56%
This is a sequence -- and
actually, the reason the sun is kind

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:36.520
of reddish is actually
that has a filter on it

00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:38.810
until it gets to totality.

00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:40.860
And that's when they
actually take the filter off.

00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:44.070
So one of the things that
I'll talk about later again is

00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:49.400
that when you're looking up at
the sun during the partial phase,

00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:53.750
as soon as it gets dark when
you're in the path of totality,

00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:55.550
that's actually when you
take your glasses off.

00:13:55.550 --> 00:14:01.390
And that's when you're seeing
the total solar eclipse.

00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:04.240
Okay? But what is it
really going to look

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:08.370
like if I zoom in, okay, closer in?

00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:10.000
This is what it's going
to look like.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.770
So let me tell you a
few things about this.

00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:15.940
So this is a digital
image, a photograph.

00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:19.070
And in fact our eyes do
a better job than this.

00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:22.810
This does not do it justice
in terms of what you see.

00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:24.980
Now, this is zoomed in some.

00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:29.070
It will be a bit smaller from
your perspective on the ground.

00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:32.950
But you will see more detail
than you can see in here in terms

00:14:32.950 --> 00:14:36.460
of that wispy structure
around the edge.

00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:38.670
Now, closer to reality -- now,

00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:42.880
this is actually taking it
several images together --

00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:44.650
it will look more like this.

00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:48.240
Again, this is zoomed in, but you
will see more structure and detail

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:51.990
like this because our eyes
have much more dynamic range.

00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:56.420
They can see much more
variation in the light,

00:14:56.420 --> 00:15:00.130
in the fainter light
structures that you will see.

00:15:00.130 --> 00:15:04.730
So here is just a quick --
I'm going to talk quickly

00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:08.070
about the safety aspect again, and
then I want to talk a little bit

00:15:08.070 --> 00:15:13.700
about what's special about this
eclipse and put it in perspective

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:15.120
with eclipses in general.

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:16.440
So a couple of things.

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:21.990
So there's two ways to view the
partial part of the eclipse.

00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:25.890
One is to directly look at it
but not with your naked eyes,

00:15:25.890 --> 00:15:29.000
with glasses specially
designed for this.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.720
They're usually called safe solar
viewing or eclipse viewing glasses.

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:35.020
Those are the ones
that I've put outside.

00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:36.360
I brought about 200 pairs.

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:38.780
So everybody should
at least get one,

00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:41.210 position:56%
and we can always help you get more.

00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:43.960
And there's also lots of
them across the country

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:46.020
at libraries, community centers.

00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:49.540
NASA has worked with a lot of other
organizations and we have millions

00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:52.220
and millions of them
out in the public.

00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:54.000
So there's no shortage of these.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.230
I know the people printing
them are working faster

00:15:57.230 --> 00:15:59.630
than 24/7 to get these done.

00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:01.120
So you can do that.

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:03.920
You can even buy special glasses.

00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:05.220
They're a little more expensive.

00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:06.520
They're not paper ones.

00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:09.180
There are even companies
that make binoculars

00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:10.580
that have filters on them.

00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:14.290
But I want to emphasize:
Never use these glasses

00:16:14.290 --> 00:16:16.190
with binoculars together.

00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:17.870
That's actually very dangerous.

00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:22.830
Because in fact, binoculars are
telescopes, will amplify the image

00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:26.930
of the sun, amplify the light,
and will damage these glasses.

00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:30.090
Also, if the glasses slip off while
you're looking through binoculars

00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:31.880
or a telescope, it's
even more dangerous

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:33.180
than just looking directly.

00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:34.840
So don't ever use these --

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:37.820
you can only use binoculars
that actually have filters built

00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:40.840
into them or specially
designed filters.

00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:44.710
But the other way to look at is
it because you probably don't want

00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:49.480
to stare up for four hours while
the partial phase is going on.

00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:51.980
You're going to get
tired of doing that.

00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:53.580
But you don't have to do that.

00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:57.320
You can actually use what we call
indirect or projection methods.

00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:00.500
So any kind of pinhole will do.

00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:03.230
It will project a little
small image of the sun.

00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:05.970
You'll see the crescent as
the moon moves across it.

00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:08.050
I'm actually going to
take a colander with me.

00:17:08.050 --> 00:17:11.790
I'm going to wear a colander,
put it over, and it's going

00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:14.930
to make lots of cool images.

00:17:14.930 --> 00:17:19.170
You can get -- we actually
ourselves and several other

00:17:19.170 --> 00:17:21.940
of our colleagues have
produced postcards

00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:24.840
that already have holes
put into them.

00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:28.900
You can project it with
actually a mirror, a little,

00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:30.680
small mirror and an envelope.

00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:34.350
We've got this on our website,
which I'll list the website later.

00:17:34.350 --> 00:17:36.980
But there's also the trees.

00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:40.480 position:56%
The trees themselves when the leaves
cross will make their own type

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:44.160
of little pinholes and you'll see
these really cool shadows projected

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:45.460
on the ground.

00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:47.180
The first time I saw that,
it was really amazing.

00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:48.910
I looked down and there
were all these shadows,

00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:51.200
but all the shadows are,
like, little crescents.

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:53.270
It's a really, really cool effect.

00:17:53.270 --> 00:18:00.610
And you can actually take
a box like a cereal box,

00:18:00.610 --> 00:18:05.530
you close all the parts of it,

00:18:05.530 --> 00:18:07.690
inside you can put a
piece of white paper.

00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:11.900
On the other side you make a big
hole, you put a piece of tinfoil,

00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:13.930
tape it over, poke a hole in that.

00:18:13.930 --> 00:18:16.380
And on the other side you make a
hole that you can look through.

00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:19.790
So you have the sun this
way and you would look

00:18:19.790 --> 00:18:23.040
down with the sun behind you,
project through the pinhole,

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:26.000
into the box, and then you
can look through and see it.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.430
You can do that with
larger boxes, too.

00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:30.050
So there's a lot of
different ways to do that.

00:18:30.050 --> 00:18:33.180
And there's a lot of great
information on our website,

00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:35.270
which I'll show again,
as well as colleagues

00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:39.840 position:56%
like the AAS have a really fantastic
website with all this information.

00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:43.060
So let's talk about
eclipses in general.

00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:48.210 position:56%
So why are -- you know, even though
we have these issues with the orbit,

00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:52.150 position:56%
they make it so the eclipses don't
happen every month, we get some kind

00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:55.010
of eclipse every six months.

00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:57.000
But actually, for total
solar eclipses,

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.590
we get on average a total
solar eclipse somewhere

00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:04.280
in the world every 18 months.

00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:07.990
But the problem is the
world is really big.

00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:11.370
So those eclipses are
happening everywhere,

00:19:11.370 --> 00:19:15.040
but they're mostly happening
over water or over places

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:16.970 position:56%
where there are not a lot of people.

00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:21.060
So that's the first reason that
this eclipse is really special.

00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:27.950 position:56%
Because it's happening from coast to
coast over the United States, okay,

00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:30.190
over the lower 48 states.

00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:33.120
A lot of people live there,

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:35.230
and a lot of people are going
to get to experience it.

00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:38.250
So that's one of the reasons
that this is really exciting.

00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:43.600
It's happening over such a large
piece of land that's populated,

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:46.510
and it's going to basically be
happening over an hour and a half.

00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:48.720
So in some ways we -- I'll talk
a little bit more about this --

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:52.830 position:56%
but we're going to have not two
minutes of observations, but an hour

00:19:52.830 --> 00:19:55.430
and a half of observations.

00:19:55.430 --> 00:20:00.090
Here's another perspective from a
colleague who makes fantastic maps.

00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:03.560
This is just to show you, again,
they're happening all over,

00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:05.070
but they're happening in places

00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:07.400
where there are just
not a lot of people.

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:12.490
So this particular eclipse
also is pretty interesting

00:20:12.490 --> 00:20:14.420
for several reasons.

00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:16.780
Now, this is a collection
of all the eclipses

00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:20.720
in the US from 1776 to 2017.

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:24.370
So a couple of features about
this particular eclipse.

00:20:24.370 --> 00:20:31.960
This is the first coast to
coast eclipse since 1918, okay?

00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:37.510
This is the first total solar
eclipse in anywhere in the US

00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:40.570
since 1991, but that was Hawaii.

00:20:40.570 --> 00:20:46.040
The previous one was in 1979
in the northwestern part

00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:48.810
of the United States over
about, I think, four states.

00:20:48.810 --> 00:20:53.070 position:56%
The next one that is going to happen

00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:56.550
in the United States is
actually going to be in 2024.

00:20:56.550 --> 00:21:01.160
But one of the things that's
interesting to add to what's kind

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:06.090
of cool about this particular
eclipse is the path for the one

00:21:06.090 --> 00:21:11.810
in August is going to -- the one
in 2024's going to cross that.

00:21:11.810 --> 00:21:15.520
So in Carbondale, Illinois the
eclipse seven years later is going

00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:22.130
to cross the one that's
happening in August 21st.

00:21:22.130 --> 00:21:26.450
On average eclipses
happen at the same location

00:21:26.450 --> 00:21:31.450
on the globe every about 375 years.

00:21:31.450 --> 00:21:37.790
There's another one, 2045, that's
going to cross the one in 2024,

00:21:37.790 --> 00:21:41.920
and it's going to cross
it farther south.

00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:45.650
So this is pretty cool.

00:21:45.650 --> 00:21:48.360
The odds of this are pretty rare.

00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:50.690
So these are some of the reasons

00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:52.710
that make this particular
eclipse pretty exciting.

00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:57.120
So here's zooming in on just the
ones that are going to be happening

00:21:57.120 --> 00:22:02.670
over this year, 2024, and
2045 just to show you.

00:22:02.670 --> 00:22:06.320
So you can see where
they cross each other.

00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:10.220
So that's a pretty rare
and pretty exciting thing.

00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:13.150
Actually, I was mentioning
Carbondale,

00:22:13.150 --> 00:22:14.790
they like to call it the
crossroads of the eclipse.

00:22:14.790 --> 00:22:16.430
I was actually going
to be in Carbondale,

00:22:16.430 --> 00:22:17.860
but now I'm not going
to be in Carbondale.

00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:22.400
So I just got my plans
changed on me, so.

00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:25.340
But that's going to be
pretty exciting for folks

00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:27.060
that will be there because
they'll get to see it again

00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:29.830
in just seven years
in the same place.

00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:35.780
So here's a summary of
the path across the US.

00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:40.220
And we have maps at
NASA on our website,

00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:43.330
which is Eclipse2017.NASA.gov.

00:22:43.330 --> 00:22:48.220
And all of these maps
are made along with lots

00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:52.590 position:56%
of different visualizations like the
one I showed you to give you tons

00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:54.990
of different perspectives
of what's going on.

00:22:54.990 --> 00:22:56.530
And one of the things
that's really cool

00:22:56.530 --> 00:23:02.360
about this is these maps were made
using a lot of data from NASA.

00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:04.150
So that's one of the things
that's sort of exciting,

00:23:04.150 --> 00:23:08.260
is that all the data that we're
able to gather, we're using it

00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:11.430
to provide the most
accurate results.

00:23:11.430 --> 00:23:14.590
I won't go into the details
because it's a talk unto itself.

00:23:14.590 --> 00:23:20.850
But I mentioned the fact that the
shadow itself is not an ellipse

00:23:20.850 --> 00:23:22.150
or not a circle.

00:23:22.150 --> 00:23:25.250
And in fact, using the
data, for example, from LRO,

00:23:25.250 --> 00:23:27.950
the Lunar Reconnaissance
Orbiter, we've been able

00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:34.580 position:56%
to provide the most accurate maps of
the shape of the shadow as it moves

00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:40.450 position:56%
across the country, as well as where
the actual edge of totality is.

00:23:40.450 --> 00:23:44.340
Because the issue there is that
even if you're right at the line

00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:48.050
where totality is, all you have to
do is step right over and outside

00:23:48.050 --> 00:23:50.030
of it and you're not in totality.

00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:53.490 position:56%
Okay? So knowing where that line is,
you're fine if you're in the center.

00:23:53.490 --> 00:23:58.890
But when you get close to the edge,
the precision actually matters.

00:23:58.890 --> 00:24:02.100
Now, I will add just a little
caveat, there actually are a lot

00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:03.990
of eclipse hunters that are
interested in staying close

00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:08.290
to the edge because you see
more structure and change,

00:24:08.290 --> 00:24:14.100
more of these Bailey's beads, as
well as the diamond ring effect

00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:16.100
when you're close to the edge.

00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:19.420
So there they really want to make
sure that they know where they are.

00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:22.560
So a couple of things
about the people

00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:27.300
that are going to see this eclipse.

00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:34.620
So this is a map showing you how
many people live within 50, 100,

00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:39.340
up to 500 miles of the eclipse.

00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:45.650
So it turns out that majority of --
depending on how fast you drive --

00:24:45.650 --> 00:24:50.510
I mean, I think I can probably
drive 12 hours in a day.

00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:54.960
But even sort of an average
driver, a good proportion

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:56.420
of the population lives

00:24:56.420 --> 00:24:59.620
within driving distance
of the path of totality.

00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:02.060
So it's going to be a
really interesting event.

00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:06.070
I'll just add that the reality is

00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:08.980
that we actually don't know
how crazy it's going to be.

00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:11.800
And it's something that people are
very interested in finding out.

00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:14.300
And I've talked to a lot of
folks at DOT, the Department

00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:17.580
of Transportation, and
they're very interested

00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:23.230 position:56%
in seeing what's really going to
happen when people try to get there.

00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:27.000
I can guarantee you that people
who wake up the morning and go,

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.520
"There's eclipse today," and try
to get there are out of luck.

00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:32.470
Probably the people who wake
up the day before and try

00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:34.750
to get there are out of luck.

00:25:34.750 --> 00:25:37.070
And certainly depending
on where you are.

00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:40.290
But there's going to be a lot of
people who wake up and go, "Hey,

00:25:40.290 --> 00:25:42.900
I just heard there's a total solar
eclipse, let's go check it out,"

00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:47.170
and it's 20 miles away and
they're not going to get there.

00:25:47.170 --> 00:25:50.700
So if you are planning on going,
that's one thing to remember,

00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:54.410
something we try to emphasize
again and again: Plan ahead.

00:25:54.410 --> 00:26:00.110
This is like Woodstock 200 times
over but across the whole country.

00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:03.000
Okay? So in terms of logistics,

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.590
make sure that you have
sunscreen, it's going to be August.

00:26:06.590 --> 00:26:08.170
It's going to be hot everywhere.

00:26:08.170 --> 00:26:11.650
Make sure you have water, food.

00:26:11.650 --> 00:26:17.120
But if you have an opportunity
to go see this, take it.

00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:19.670
Because you will not
be disappointed.

00:26:19.670 --> 00:26:24.280
If you're interested in going to
see it, here's an average map.

00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:25.610
There are some more updated ones.

00:26:25.610 --> 00:26:26.910
NOAA just put out one.

00:26:26.910 --> 00:26:30.520
I've actually been trying to
sort of sort through the results.

00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:32.470
But this is one from last year.

00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:35.160
This is an average map to
show you the cloud cover.

00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:39.620
So you can see that, of
course, basically west

00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:42.350
of the Mississippi it
gets better and better.

00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:48.130
Places like eastern Oregon, Idaho,
Wyoming, those are the best places.

00:26:48.130 --> 00:26:54.610
As you start to get over
towards the East Coast it starts

00:26:54.610 --> 00:27:00.870
to get a little bit more dicey
in terms of the cloud cover.

00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:05.370
I'm actually now going to be
in Charleston, South Carolina.

00:27:05.370 --> 00:27:07.830
So I grew up in the South.

00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:11.780
I know that at 2:00 and 3:00
o'clock, that's thunderstorm time.

00:27:11.780 --> 00:27:13.080
So we'll see.

00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:17.300
But it is close to the coast, and
that does make a difference, too.

00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:21.020
So real brief, I don't like
to put a lot of words up.

00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:22.320
But just a couple of things.

00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:24.690
These are sort of the things that
are really important to NASA.

00:27:24.690 --> 00:27:25.990
Now, why does NASA care?

00:27:25.990 --> 00:27:28.980
Well, first and foremost, one of
the things that's very important

00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:33.490
to NASA is communicating
science, communicating what we do.

00:27:33.490 --> 00:27:36.650
Because everything that
we do at NASA is yours.

00:27:36.650 --> 00:27:46.030
Okay? We work for the country to
explore the reaches of science,

00:27:46.030 --> 00:27:49.670
technology, our solar
system, and beyond.

00:27:49.670 --> 00:27:53.460
And so sharing that knowledge
is paramount and part

00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:57.630
of the fundamental edict of NASA.

00:27:57.630 --> 00:28:01.660
But in terms of the eclipse,
safety is first and foremost --

00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:05.540
safety in terms of viewing
and safety in terms of going

00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:09.740
to the events and making sure
that you've really planned ahead.

00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:11.790
Science, I'm going
to talk about that.

00:28:11.790 --> 00:28:15.160
Education, it is a huge
education opportunity.

00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:19.220 position:56%
I'm not going focus so much on that,
but that is something that folks

00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:21.640
that I work with have spent
a lot of time thinking about.

00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:26.070
This has been a really interesting
challenge to both, you know,

00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:30.550 position:56%
how do we reach and take this as an
opportunity to talk about, you know,

00:28:30.550 --> 00:28:33.850
orbits, and the sun, the moon,

00:28:33.850 --> 00:28:37.450
the whole sun/earth/moon
system, and even the earth?

00:28:37.450 --> 00:28:39.310
Because one of the things
I'll touch on briefly is

00:28:39.310 --> 00:28:45.910
that this is actually a unique
opportunity to do earth science --

00:28:45.910 --> 00:28:49.650
not just sun and moon,
but actually earth.

00:28:49.650 --> 00:28:51.950
There's some unique opportunities,
which I'll talk about.

00:28:51.950 --> 00:28:55.590
So these are some of the
science that we're interested in.

00:28:55.590 --> 00:28:57.680
Of course, there's the sun.

00:28:57.680 --> 00:28:59.520
There's observing it
from the ground,

00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:02.140
observing from earth,
studying the moon.

00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:05.470
Actually, in this case LRO is going
to have the advantage of looking

00:29:05.470 --> 00:29:08.190
at the shadow from the moon.

00:29:08.190 --> 00:29:13.050
And that's a really,
really amazing opportunity.

00:29:13.050 --> 00:29:16.840
This is a way to connect to other
types of science that we do,

00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:18.140
not necessarily directly.

00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:23.400
But eclipse is a special type
of what we call a transit

00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:25.470
where one object moves in
front of another one --

00:29:25.470 --> 00:29:28.730
a planet moves in front
of a star or a moon moves

00:29:28.730 --> 00:29:30.560
in front of another planet.

00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:33.510
Within our solar system,
using transits

00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:38.490 position:56%
and eclipses is a very important
way in which we study those objects.

00:29:38.490 --> 00:29:41.200 position:56%
And beyond that, it's a critical way

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:43.250
that we study things
like exoplanets.

00:29:43.250 --> 00:29:47.990
And that's actually how we find
exoplanets is by transits, okay.

00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:50.330
Now, I'll add one thing here.

00:29:50.330 --> 00:29:53.260
I'll talk a little bit more
about some of the earth science.

00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:56.670 position:56%
But actually, something I just found
out a couple weeks ago, actually,

00:29:56.670 --> 00:30:01.810
my colleague in the audience
came up with a brilliant idea.

00:30:01.810 --> 00:30:06.880
We're going to be flying
balloons around the country.

00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:08.990
I think it's 57.

00:30:08.990 --> 00:30:11.820
So 57 high-altitude balloons.

00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:16.210 position:56%
And these balloons are going to go
in a range of 60,000 to 80,000 feet.

00:30:16.210 --> 00:30:21.170
So that's generally to look down at
the earth, we'll look at the shadow

00:30:21.170 --> 00:30:23.680
to see the changing environment.

00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:28.020
But it's about the pressure --

00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:30.340
it's equivalent to
basically the atmosphere

00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:32.480
that you experience on Mars.

00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:37.870
Okay? So what the idea was is
you take these little packets

00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:39.820
that have bacteria --

00:30:39.820 --> 00:30:43.110
and I apologize if I don't
say it exactly right --

00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:47.210
but put these little packets with
bacteria and actually send them

00:30:47.210 --> 00:30:50.180
up in the balloons to
study what happens.

00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:55.680
Because ultimately, we want to
know, you know, is there life --

00:30:55.680 --> 00:31:01.300
are the components of
life or is there even life

00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:06.000
in the solar system beyond earth
or even beyond our solar system?

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:10.560
So one of the places that it's
critical to study this is Mars.

00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:12.650
So this is an opportunity
to actually connect

00:31:12.650 --> 00:31:16.140
with our neighbor planet
and study the environment.

00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:18.050
So I think it's really cool.

00:31:18.050 --> 00:31:24.700
And it's what we call a mission
of opportunity or an experiment

00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:27.720
of opportunity where we added
something onto something

00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:29.510
that was already happening.

00:31:29.510 --> 00:31:34.590
But I'm going to focus for
a short bit on the sun.

00:31:34.590 --> 00:31:36.900
This actually happens
to be my area of study.

00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:39.620
I'm a solar physicist.

00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:43.500
And the eclipse, as I
mentioned, is an opportunity

00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:47.150
to really study a unique
and critical part

00:31:47.150 --> 00:31:49.360 position:56%
of the sun's atmosphere, the corona.

00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:52.430
Okay? So, you know, I showed
you those images of the sun.

00:31:52.430 --> 00:31:56.320
They weren't too exciting,
except for the eclipse image.

00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:57.620
But you know what?

00:31:57.620 --> 00:32:01.360 position:56%
If we step outside into space, okay,
we step outside of the atmosphere --

00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:05.930
right now we see the sun from the
ground in a very narrow region,

00:32:05.930 --> 00:32:09.420
a narrow band of light
-- mostly visible light,

00:32:09.420 --> 00:32:12.740
a little bit of UV infrared.

00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:17.220
But it's a small portion of the
entire electromagnetic spectrum.

00:32:17.220 --> 00:32:21.160 position:56%
You know, light goes from microwaves
and radio waves all the way

00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:22.860
to X-rays and gamma waves.

00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:26.390
And it's huge changes
in the amount of energy

00:32:26.390 --> 00:32:29.410
and the characteristics
of that light.

00:32:29.410 --> 00:32:33.350 position:56%
And that tells you lots of different
things depending on which kind

00:32:33.350 --> 00:32:34.650
of light you're looking at.

00:32:34.650 --> 00:32:38.030
But when we go out into
space and we look at the sun,

00:32:38.030 --> 00:32:40.150
we see something very different.

00:32:40.150 --> 00:32:42.940
This is the sun that we see.

00:32:42.940 --> 00:32:45.540
Can we turn these lights
down a little bit?

00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:46.980
We can't? Okay.

00:32:46.980 --> 00:32:50.940
Well, what you're seeing here is
the sun in extreme ultraviolet.

00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:52.880
And hopefully you can see --

00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:56.460
I have this dying urge to run
over to this image and touch it.

00:32:56.460 --> 00:33:01.870
But you see all this
activity happening, okay?

00:33:01.870 --> 00:33:03.760
You're seeing huge explosions.

00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:05.650
You see that flash of light?

00:33:05.650 --> 00:33:08.020
That's called a solar flare.

00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:12.360 position:56%
That is enough energy is released
in that flash of light over a period

00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:17.450
of a few minutes to hours to power
the entire world for 100,000 years.

00:33:17.450 --> 00:33:20.770
Okay? But not only do you
have that flash of light,

00:33:20.770 --> 00:33:26.390
the sun is also expelling huge
blobs of itself and magnetic field

00:33:26.390 --> 00:33:28.940
and solar material are
flying off into space

00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:31.190
at millions of miles an hour.

00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:35.090
And all of this stuff, all of this
energy and material is filling

00:33:35.090 --> 00:33:38.180 position:56%
and bathing the entire solar system.

00:33:38.180 --> 00:33:43.530
And it creates an entire
environment as this --

00:33:43.530 --> 00:33:47.790
all this stuff coming off the
sun interacts with the planets,

00:33:47.790 --> 00:33:53.200
with comets, with asteroids, with
everything in our solar system.

00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:57.370
Here's another example
from the same spacecraft.

00:33:57.370 --> 00:34:00.470
So you're seeing these
huge eruptions many,

00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:02.440
many times the size of the earth.

00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:06.910
Okay? That thing, when it
gets to its farthest expanse,

00:34:06.910 --> 00:34:12.380
it's about 15 earths from the
edge of the sun to the top of it.

00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:19.700
And that's billions of tons of
solar material that are flying off.

00:34:19.700 --> 00:34:24.120
So this area, all of
this action that you see,

00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:29.110
all this stuff happening on
the sun happens in the corona.

00:34:29.110 --> 00:34:31.250 position:56%
It happens in this region of the sun

00:34:31.250 --> 00:34:34.770
that we see during a
total solar eclipse.

00:34:34.770 --> 00:34:37.660
Okay? And I won't go
into all the details,

00:34:37.660 --> 00:34:41.210
but basically what's happening
is the sun is a giant ball

00:34:41.210 --> 00:34:43.860
of electrified gas.

00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:46.800
And inside of it, it
has magnetic fields.

00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:49.940
These are the same magnetic
fields that make a magnet stick

00:34:49.940 --> 00:34:52.120
to your refrigerator, okay?

00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:56.200
But these are huge and
much, much stronger.

00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:59.420
But these magnetic fields are
kind of like little rubber bands,

00:34:59.420 --> 00:35:01.400
except they're really,
really big rubber bands.

00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:03.420
When you twist them and
twist them and twist them --

00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:06.300 position:56%
if you take a rubber band, you twist
it and twist and it and twist it,

00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:07.940 position:56%
eventually it will start to knot up.

00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:10.600
At some point you're going to
twist it enough it's going to pop.

00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:14.370
And when it pops, it
actually releases energy.

00:35:14.370 --> 00:35:16.520
The same thing happens
with magnetic fields,

00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:19.180
they have a similar
property: They get all twisted

00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:21.170
and they release that energy.

00:35:21.170 --> 00:35:25.270
And that's what's creating that
solar flare and that big blob

00:35:25.270 --> 00:35:28.040
of stuff flying off the sun.

00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:33.310
And so all that structure that you
saw in those images of the corona,

00:35:33.310 --> 00:35:35.170
that's actually magnetic field.

00:35:35.170 --> 00:35:39.280
They're invisible, but the corona
itself actually highlights them.

00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:41.080
You can see them.

00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:44.980
And understanding what's happening
there is telling us why this is

00:35:44.980 --> 00:35:46.500
happening and helping us

00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:49.530
to understand not only
why it's happening,

00:35:49.530 --> 00:35:52.450
but how do we predict this?

00:35:52.450 --> 00:35:54.930
The ultimate reason is because all

00:35:54.930 --> 00:35:57.770
of this stuff is interacting
with all of the planets.

00:35:57.770 --> 00:36:01.080
And it's part of the fundamental
environment that we have

00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:05.790
to understand, but also this
stuff is electromagnetic, okay?

00:36:05.790 --> 00:36:08.620
It responds to electricity
and magnetism.

00:36:08.620 --> 00:36:13.400
And what in our society responds
to electricity and magnetism?

00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:15.650
Technology.

00:36:15.650 --> 00:36:20.150
And so we have satellites
in space, we have GPS,

00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:24.260
we have communication systems,
we even have power grids

00:36:24.260 --> 00:36:27.300
on the ground -- all
of them interact

00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:30.960
with this stuff that
comes off the sun.

00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:34.880
And sometimes these
explosions can be large enough

00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:37.880
that they actually can knock
out our communications,

00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:40.320
it can disable spacecraft.

00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:42.540
It actually creates an
incredibly harsh environment

00:36:42.540 --> 00:36:46.180
in space for astronauts.

00:36:46.180 --> 00:36:48.300
So we need to understand
that environment not only

00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:50.240
around the earth, but
traveling to places

00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:53.790
like Mars understanding this
environment is critical.

00:36:53.790 --> 00:36:56.530
And in the worst case scenario
we have seen in the past

00:36:56.530 --> 00:37:00.140
when power grids went down
because of these solar eruptions.

00:37:00.140 --> 00:37:03.370
So these are all the reasons
why we have to understand it.

00:37:03.370 --> 00:37:07.410
So we can make artificial
eclipse in space

00:37:07.410 --> 00:37:10.710
and you can see this
material coming off.

00:37:10.710 --> 00:37:14.870
But the problem is
you see that circle --

00:37:14.870 --> 00:37:17.110
that's actually where the sun is.

00:37:17.110 --> 00:37:19.870
Because even though we can
make these eclipses in space,

00:37:19.870 --> 00:37:23.770
we can't do as good a
job as the moon does

00:37:23.770 --> 00:37:25.840
with the earth and the sun.

00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:32.800
This is the eclipse I showed you,
and that area from the black disc

00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:37.900
out to that white line
is that area outside

00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:41.060
of this white disc
that we don't see.

00:37:41.060 --> 00:37:45.450
So you're seeing that from the
ground we see this whole area --

00:37:45.450 --> 00:37:50.320
actually, the most important
region for space weather

00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:56.070 position:56%
and solar activity, we only see this
invisible light from the ground.

00:37:56.070 --> 00:38:00.240
So what that means is we
have a unique opportunity

00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:06.580
to see the eclipse and see what's
happening on the sun in a way

00:38:06.580 --> 00:38:08.070
that we normally couldn't see even

00:38:08.070 --> 00:38:10.870
with the most sophisticated
spacecraft.

00:38:10.870 --> 00:38:14.200
Now, back to what makes
this eclipse special.

00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:19.180
Normally an eclipse at any one
location is only two minutes or so.

00:38:19.180 --> 00:38:23.910
But think of this like having
a camera following a player

00:38:23.910 --> 00:38:25.970
down a football field
or a soccer field.

00:38:25.970 --> 00:38:29.120
You have a string,
the camera follows it,

00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:31.210
and you can see the
action all the way.

00:38:31.210 --> 00:38:35.270
We can't quite do that because
we can't follow the shadow that's

00:38:35.270 --> 00:38:37.510
moving at 1,500 miles per hour.

00:38:37.510 --> 00:38:42.930
But we can line up lots of cameras
along the path, lots of telescopes,

00:38:42.930 --> 00:38:47.500
and even lots of balloons to
study as this thing moves along.

00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:49.460
We can put all that data together.

00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:53.010
And now instead of having
a two-minute observation,

00:38:53.010 --> 00:38:55.710
we have an hour and
a half observation.

00:38:55.710 --> 00:38:59.910
And we can finally see things
that are happening here.

00:38:59.910 --> 00:39:02.290
Now, there are lots of other
things that are exciting.

00:39:02.290 --> 00:39:05.400
One of the things we're going to
do is we're testing technology

00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:07.840
on the ground that we'll
eventually put into space --

00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:09.360
that's an important thing.

00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:11.640
Because you want to test
things before you fly them.

00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:13.780
So that's another opportunity.

00:39:13.780 --> 00:39:16.220
And I'm glossing over the details.

00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:19.450
But the other part
is the earth part.

00:39:19.450 --> 00:39:25.240 position:56%
So the eclipse itself, when that
shadow is moving across the country,

00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:31.320
where it hits, it gets dark --
about as dark as a moonlit night,

00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:36.900
the temperature drops five, ten,
more degrees; the winds change;

00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:42.650
animals become quiet or freaked
out; this whole eerie structure.

00:39:42.650 --> 00:39:45.070
You look around, you're
sitting inside this shadow

00:39:45.070 --> 00:39:48.510
and every direction is
dusk all the way around.

00:39:48.510 --> 00:39:53.320
So it creates a really
amazing local environment.

00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:56.740
And that local environment
moves across the country.

00:39:56.740 --> 00:40:00.150
So that's one of the things we're
doing, is we're actually looking

00:40:00.150 --> 00:40:05.430
at how the environment, how
the climate, how the animals,

00:40:05.430 --> 00:40:08.340
how the plants, how
everything reacts

00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:10.550
as it it's moving across
the country.

00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:14.090
And because it's going over
such a huge piece of land,

00:40:14.090 --> 00:40:20.610
we can study many different little
mini-environments all together.

00:40:20.610 --> 00:40:22.520
So that's kind of the
earth perspective.

00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:27.960
So we're doing huge amounts of
science, looking at the shadow

00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:31.890
from the moon; the looking at
the corona from the ground;

00:40:31.890 --> 00:40:36.780
looking at the earth, seeing how
it changes both down on the ground

00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:41.390
and even from balloons above and
even spacecraft are looking down --

00:40:41.390 --> 00:40:44.600
earth observing spacecraft
are following this.

00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:48.400
So this is an opportunity
to bring together all

00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:50.900
of these different
ground-based observations,

00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:57.480
space-based observations and
get a holistic big picture.

00:40:57.480 --> 00:41:02.780 position:56%
Not just one snapshot here or there,
but to see all of what's happening

00:41:02.780 --> 00:41:05.840
from all these different
vantage points.

00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:09.800
And that's really where
NASA is bringing

00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:12.510
in all the things that
it has to offer.

00:41:12.510 --> 00:41:15.710
It's bringing in all of these
different assets and helping

00:41:15.710 --> 00:41:19.430 position:56%
to bring them all together,
working with many different partners

00:41:19.430 --> 00:41:25.110
from different government agencies,
universities, private industry --

00:41:25.110 --> 00:41:28.850
all of these are coming together
to bring all this science

00:41:28.850 --> 00:41:30.870
for this unique opportunity.

00:41:30.870 --> 00:41:36.320
So let me wrap up with --
this is actually a map,

00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:39.800
and this map actually is now out
of date, it changes so quickly.

00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:44.140
But this is just showing you
NASA along the path is going

00:41:44.140 --> 00:41:49.980
to have NASA TV crews that
will be taping at local places

00:41:49.980 --> 00:41:53.140
where they'll be observing the
eclipse, having activities.

00:41:53.140 --> 00:41:56.190
We're going to have observations
from aircraft starting

00:41:56.190 --> 00:41:58.170
at the beginning of the eclipse.

00:41:58.170 --> 00:42:01.870
We have a boat from the Coast
Guard at the end of the eclipse

00:42:01.870 --> 00:42:04.860
that will be launching a balloon.

00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:09.840
We also have lots of educational
activities along the path,

00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:11.660
and we're coordinating
with many different people.

00:42:11.660 --> 00:42:13.330
So all of this will
be brought together

00:42:13.330 --> 00:42:16.340
in a big broadcast from NASA TV.

00:42:16.340 --> 00:42:21.780
And then NASA TV will also be
bringing in through NASA.gov lots

00:42:21.780 --> 00:42:24.840
of webcasts from all
these different locations.

00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:29.740
And it includes webcasts from
every one of those 57 balloons.

00:42:29.740 --> 00:42:32.960
So what's going to be seen
from all those balloons

00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:39.830
at 80,000 feet will be broadcast
live down to the NASA website.

00:42:39.830 --> 00:42:48.480
So to find out more, you can
go to the NASA website --

00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:53.300
actually, hold on, it's telling
me to connect to the Wi-Fi.

00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:57.220
So Eclipse2017.NASA.gov.

00:42:57.220 --> 00:43:01.910
I'll also add that
next week on Wednesday,

00:43:01.910 --> 00:43:10.640
the 21st of June is a news press
conference from the Newseum

00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:12.990
that will be broadcast by NASA TV.

00:43:12.990 --> 00:43:16.390
We'll have partners from NOAA,
from the National Park Service.

00:43:16.390 --> 00:43:17.930
I didn't add that actually some

00:43:17.930 --> 00:43:22.300
of those sites you see are
actually park service sites.

00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:26.020
We'll have members of
some other agencies there,

00:43:26.020 --> 00:43:30.410
as well as many different
experts from around NASA to talk

00:43:30.410 --> 00:43:33.640
to the press, to tell
everybody about what's going on.

00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:35.120
This has been a huge opportunity.

00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:39.850
If you go to this website, you can
find maps, Google Maps with links

00:43:39.850 --> 00:43:41.330
to all of the different activities

00:43:41.330 --> 00:43:43.050
that are happening
across the country.

00:43:43.050 --> 00:43:48.580
We have groups -- for example,
there are 1,500 libraries

00:43:48.580 --> 00:43:51.760
that are connected through
one of our partners.

00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:57.250 position:56%
And there's also lots of educational
materials, as well as maps,

00:43:57.250 --> 00:44:00.830
all of the materials that you
can get today is on the site

00:44:00.830 --> 00:44:02.770
and downloadable for free.

00:44:02.770 --> 00:44:06.890
And then you can find out
what's going on and any changes

00:44:06.890 --> 00:44:09.300
that are happening for the event.

00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:17.270
So lastly, be safe, plan
ahead, and have fun.

00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:19.890
Enjoy and watch the show.

00:44:19.890 --> 00:44:22.770
And if you can't be in the path
of totality, there's going to be

00:44:22.770 --> 00:44:26.170
so much coming out from NASA,
from our colleagues at places

00:44:26.170 --> 00:44:27.480
like the Exploratorium

00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:31.670
that hopefully you'll
get to experience it.

00:44:31.670 --> 00:44:35.510
And it's just going to want to
make you go to the 2024 eclipse.

00:44:35.510 --> 00:44:42.110
[ Applause ]

00:44:42.110 --> 00:44:43.510
&gt;&gt; For those who don't
have to run off,

00:44:43.510 --> 00:44:45.420
I guess we could take
a couple questions.

00:44:45.420 --> 00:44:47.710
And if you would repeat
the questions.

00:44:47.710 --> 00:44:49.010
&gt;&gt; Dr. C. Alex Young: Yes, ma'am?

00:44:49.010 --> 00:45:00.200
&gt;&gt; You mentioned being
concerned about binoculars;

00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:02.100
what concerns about
photographs or [inaudible]?

00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:05.320
&gt;&gt; Dr. C. Alex Young: Well, as long
as you're not looking through --

00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:08.820
there's a lot of information out
there about how to do it correctly

00:45:08.820 --> 00:45:10.660
in terms of digital photography.

00:45:10.660 --> 00:45:16.100
Colleagues like Fred
Espenak and others have books

00:45:16.100 --> 00:45:18.360
and websites on how to do it.

00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:21.100
You're going to want to
use filters, for example,

00:45:21.100 --> 00:45:22.730
during the partial phase
because you're not going

00:45:22.730 --> 00:45:27.270
to see anything but
a big bright image.

00:45:27.270 --> 00:45:29.930
But there are lots of
different things you can do.

00:45:29.930 --> 00:45:32.030
You can do projection
methods and all this.

00:45:32.030 --> 00:45:35.310
So there are many different
options for doing photography.

00:45:35.310 --> 00:45:37.270
Now, the one thing
I'm going to add --

00:45:37.270 --> 00:45:40.940 position:56%
this is something that all the
eclipse experts have said to me time

00:45:40.940 --> 00:45:43.280
and time again -- unless
you're really,

00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:46.070
really set on doing photography --

00:45:46.070 --> 00:45:48.090
there is going to be
some amazing photography.

00:45:48.090 --> 00:45:50.960
And if this is the first
eclipse you've ever seen,

00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:53.570
don't waste your time
doing photography.

00:45:53.570 --> 00:45:57.400
It's two minutes, maybe less,
maybe a little bit more.

00:45:57.400 --> 00:45:59.940
Put your camera down,
look up, and enjoy it.

00:45:59.940 --> 00:46:02.770
And enjoy what's happening
around you

00:46:02.770 --> 00:46:04.830
because there will be
other opportunities.

00:46:04.830 --> 00:46:08.920
&gt;&gt; So I have studied the sun and
eclipses and ancient history.

00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:15.980
What's your favorite reference in
ancient history for [inaudible]?

00:46:15.980 --> 00:46:17.280
&gt;&gt; Dr. C. Alex Young: Oh gosh.

00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:20.570
I don't know, there's a
lot of really cool myths.

00:46:20.570 --> 00:46:23.770 position:56%
I always like there's one about -- I
mean, I guess a lot of the myths are

00:46:23.770 --> 00:46:26.400
about different animals
that are eating the moon.

00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:28.810
There's some really cool stories.

00:46:28.810 --> 00:46:31.850
And actually, what I liked
most was seeing how stories

00:46:31.850 --> 00:46:35.860
from India traveled through
different cultures and evolved

00:46:35.860 --> 00:46:37.450
and actually get to Siberia.

00:46:37.450 --> 00:46:41.300
So you can actually see how
the different stories evolved

00:46:41.300 --> 00:46:44.930
for the cultures, but
they're all the same story.

00:46:44.930 --> 00:46:47.250
So I think that's actually one
of the things I like the most.

00:46:47.250 --> 00:46:49.910
And the Vietnamese frog
that eats the eclipse.

00:46:49.910 --> 00:46:51.330
I like the frog.

00:46:51.330 --> 00:46:53.130
So but I think that's one
of the coolest things.

00:46:53.130 --> 00:46:55.200
There's a lot of really
great storie, though.

00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:56.500
Yes, sir?

00:46:56.500 --> 00:47:01.800
&gt;&gt; 1919 Eddington, was that
a solar or lunar eclipse?

00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:03.100
&gt;&gt; Dr. C. Alex Young:
It was a solar eclipse.

00:47:03.100 --> 00:47:06.890
Yeah, so referring to
Eddington looking at the eclipse

00:47:06.890 --> 00:47:12.580
in the 1900's was actually
one of the first verifications

00:47:12.580 --> 00:47:15.050
of general theory of relativity.

00:47:15.050 --> 00:47:17.890 position:56%
So it's actually great because we're

00:47:17.890 --> 00:47:21.360
down at the hundred-year
anniversary of general relativity.

00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:25.220
So he looked at both the
apparent location of a star

00:47:25.220 --> 00:47:28.140
versus its actual location
because of the bending

00:47:28.140 --> 00:47:30.910
of light by gravity of the sun.

00:47:30.910 --> 00:47:35.230
So it's a really, really neat,
neat experiment that he did.

00:47:35.230 --> 00:47:36.680
&gt;&gt; Somebody else?

00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:38.720 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Dr. C. Alex Young: Yeah, let me
make sure I get somebody else first.

00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:40.020
Go ahead.

00:47:40.020 --> 00:47:43.550
&gt;&gt; You said we couldn't
filter the sun out as well

00:47:43.550 --> 00:47:45.230
as the moon does, why is that?

00:47:45.230 --> 00:47:48.030
Why can't we do it in
space or on the ground --

00:47:48.030 --> 00:47:50.040
[ Multiple Speakers ]

00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:52.160
&gt;&gt; Dr. C. Alex Young:
Well, it's optical issues

00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:53.460
with defraction of light.

00:47:53.460 --> 00:47:57.310
I mean, when you put the
disc to block out the sun,

00:47:57.310 --> 00:48:00.730
the closer the disc
is to the camera,

00:48:00.730 --> 00:48:02.960
you're going to get defraction
around the edge of it.

00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:06.660
And with the moon/earth/sun
system, the distances are

00:48:06.660 --> 00:48:08.990
so huge you don't get
the defraction issues.

00:48:08.990 --> 00:48:14.250
So it's just a geometric
optics problem, basically.

00:48:14.250 --> 00:48:18.260
Now, we're looking at how to
make spacecraft with, you know,

00:48:18.260 --> 00:48:20.970
large separations -- that's
certainly been done in other places

00:48:20.970 --> 00:48:24.430
like X-rays where you need
to have long distances.

00:48:24.430 --> 00:48:27.120
So I think that's something
that might happen in the future,

00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:31.270
more than likely will, and
we'll just see how good we do.

00:48:31.270 --> 00:48:32.970
&gt;&gt; Show them your shoes.

00:48:32.970 --> 00:48:34.270
&gt;&gt; Dr. C. Alex Young: Oh.

00:48:34.270 --> 00:48:36.510
&gt;&gt; Solar flare shoes.

00:48:36.510 --> 00:48:40.010
[ Multiple Speakers ]

00:48:40.010 --> 00:48:41.310
[ Laughter ]

00:48:41.310 --> 00:48:42.610
&gt;&gt; Dr. C. Alex Young: So you
have a question over here.

00:48:42.610 --> 00:48:46.660
&gt;&gt; Yes, [inaudible] how do
the solar flares happen?

00:48:46.660 --> 00:48:47.960
&gt;&gt; Dr. C. Alex Young: Solar flares?

00:48:47.960 --> 00:48:49.260
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:48:49.260 --> 00:48:50.560
&gt;&gt; Dr. C. Alex Young: Oh,
okay, that's a great question.

00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:52.610
So -- well, it's kind
of a statistical thing.

00:48:52.610 --> 00:48:56.150
But they follow an activity cycle.

00:48:56.150 --> 00:49:00.360
So just like we have hurricane
cycles of roughly a year and,

00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:04.400
you know, we have a peak during
the end of the summer/beginning

00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:08.240
of the fall, the sun has
a cycle of going from low,

00:49:08.240 --> 00:49:11.360
high, to low roughly 11 years.

00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:13.680
Okay? Sometimes a little shorter,
sometimes a little longer.

00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:17.040
So we have solar flares all
the time, but as you get closer

00:49:17.040 --> 00:49:20.700
to the peak, you get
more and larger ones.

00:49:20.700 --> 00:49:22.980
What's that?

00:49:22.980 --> 00:49:26.370
Yeah, we're getting close
to the bottom right now.

00:49:26.370 --> 00:49:29.320
The peak was around 2013.

00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:30.990
There are actually two humps.

00:49:30.990 --> 00:49:33.160
There's actually two peaks.

00:49:33.160 --> 00:49:36.080
The north and south part of
the sun have different peaks.

00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:38.910
But we're getting close to
solar minimum right now.

00:49:38.910 --> 00:49:41.770
It's kind of unfortunate, but
there are different things --

00:49:41.770 --> 00:49:46.900
the structure of the corona
changes during the solar cycle.

00:49:46.900 --> 00:49:49.130
And so that's actually a
really interesting thing.

00:49:49.130 --> 00:49:52.000
So even if we don't have a lot
of activity and we don't see,

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:56.350 position:56%
let's say, an eruption happen during
the eclipse, seeing the structure

00:49:56.350 --> 00:49:58.650
of the corona change from
the solar physicist point

00:49:58.650 --> 00:50:00.300 position:56%
of view is really, really important.

00:50:00.300 --> 00:50:02.960
And actually, some things
we've seen is it's different

00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:05.110
than we've expected, actually.

00:50:05.110 --> 00:50:07.130
Did you have another question or?

00:50:07.130 --> 00:50:13.800
&gt;&gt; Does that mean the
2024 [inaudible]?

00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:15.100

00:50:15.100 --> 00:50:16.400
[ Laughter ]

00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:17.700
And that's the cool thing.

00:50:17.700 --> 00:50:19.000
I mean, I'm glad you
brought that up.

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:21.540
Because that means we have
two eclipses very close,

00:50:21.540 --> 00:50:23.110
a long period of observation,

00:50:23.110 --> 00:50:27.080
and we can see two different
parts of the solar cycle.

00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:28.500
So that's a fantastic question.

00:50:28.500 --> 00:50:31.120
I'm glad you brought that up.

00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:32.420
Yes, sir?

00:50:32.420 --> 00:50:33.720
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] questions.

00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:40.140
I just read a report stating that
most stars come into existence

00:50:40.140 --> 00:50:45.750
with a twin, come in pairs --
stars come into existence as pairs;

00:50:45.750 --> 00:50:50.010
does our sun have a
twin and where is it?

00:50:50.010 --> 00:50:51.960
&gt;&gt; Dr. C. Alex Young:
Not as far as we know.

00:50:51.960 --> 00:50:56.240
I mean, it is the case that
they're doing more binaries.

00:50:56.240 --> 00:50:59.080
Now, actually, I had
somebody tell me this morning

00:50:59.080 --> 00:51:01.080
that there's some sort of
story going around about this.

00:51:01.080 --> 00:51:04.010
I haven't checked it out.

00:51:04.010 --> 00:51:07.610
But we do not have a twin star.

00:51:07.610 --> 00:51:09.200
&gt;&gt; Okay. And if you do
find it, you will put it

00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:10.500
up on the website, right?

00:51:10.500 --> 00:51:11.800
[ Laughter ]

00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:13.260
&gt;&gt; Dr. C. Alex Young:
Oh, we certainly will.

00:51:13.260 --> 00:51:14.940
We certainly will.

00:51:14.940 --> 00:51:16.240
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:17.540
&gt;&gt; Dr. C. Alex Young: Yes, ma'am?

00:51:17.540 --> 00:51:19.130
&gt;&gt; How will cloud cover affect
viewing so we [inaudible]?

00:51:19.130 --> 00:51:20.890
&gt;&gt; Dr. C. Alex Young: Well,
so that's a good question.

00:51:20.890 --> 00:51:23.620
So how will cloud cover
affect viewing?

00:51:23.620 --> 00:51:25.980
Now, it will affect viewing.

00:51:25.980 --> 00:51:30.800
I mean, maybe you may not see the
actual eclipse, but you're going

00:51:30.800 --> 00:51:35.640
to see the light levels change, the
animals are still going to respond,

00:51:35.640 --> 00:51:36.940
the temperature's still
going to change,

00:51:36.940 --> 00:51:38.400
the environment is
still going to change.

00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:41.430
So even if you don't see
the eclipse itself --

00:51:41.430 --> 00:51:45.150
and I may have a huge risk of that
happening where I'm going to be --

00:51:45.150 --> 00:51:49.470
you still get to experience
the whole event.

00:51:49.470 --> 00:51:51.830
So don't worry, you're still going

00:51:51.830 --> 00:51:55.050
to get something spectacular
from it.

00:51:55.050 --> 00:51:56.350
Yes, sir?

00:51:56.350 --> 00:51:59.440
&gt;&gt; Do scientists know why it's
every 11 years or 8 years or 9?

00:51:59.440 --> 00:52:01.030
Or why is the cycle --

00:52:01.030 --> 00:52:02.670
&gt;&gt; Dr. C. Alex Young: That's
a really great question.

00:52:02.670 --> 00:52:05.570
The simple answer is no.

00:52:05.570 --> 00:52:10.430 position:56%
We actually know -- what we think we
know the process inside the sun is

00:52:10.430 --> 00:52:14.040
called a dynamo, okay,
which is a process

00:52:14.040 --> 00:52:19.220 position:56%
of how we actually think the
magnetic fields are generated inside

00:52:19.220 --> 00:52:23.680
things like planets like the earth,
a liquid core, sort of similar.

00:52:23.680 --> 00:52:30.150
When liquids that are conducting
spin, they create magnetic fields.

00:52:30.150 --> 00:52:32.760
We are pretty sure that's
happening inside the sun,

00:52:32.760 --> 00:52:35.210
but we don't completely
understand the physics.

00:52:35.210 --> 00:52:37.960
And we can create a
dynamo, but we can't get it

00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:41.070
to give us the right number,
you know, 11 years or 8 years.

00:52:41.070 --> 00:52:42.370
And we know it changes.

00:52:42.370 --> 00:52:45.610
We see other stars that have
cycles that are different.

00:52:45.610 --> 00:52:49.530
But right now we can't get
it to be exactly 11 years.

00:52:49.530 --> 00:52:51.440
So we don't really have
a self-consistent theory.

00:52:51.440 --> 00:52:52.740
Yes, ma'am?

00:52:52.740 --> 00:52:55.370
&gt;&gt; You had mentioned about
animals being affected

00:52:55.370 --> 00:52:56.670
by the eclipse, what happens?

00:52:56.670 --> 00:52:57.970
What do they do?

00:52:57.970 --> 00:52:59.830
And is it better if the
animal is sensitive not

00:52:59.830 --> 00:53:03.090 position:56%
to have them experience the eclipse?

00:53:03.090 --> 00:53:04.390
&gt;&gt; Dr. C. Alex Young: I
don't think there's --

00:53:04.390 --> 00:53:05.690
I mean, I'm not an expert on this.

00:53:05.690 --> 00:53:08.960
I don't think there's anything
dangerous about it for animals.

00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:12.260
Basically you can imagine if
you're sitting somewhere and all

00:53:12.260 --> 00:53:16.110
of a sudden it gets dark real quick
and you have no idea why and all

00:53:16.110 --> 00:53:19.860 position:56%
of a sudden the temperature
changes and it feels like nighttime,

00:53:19.860 --> 00:53:22.070
you're going to react to that.

00:53:22.070 --> 00:53:26.130
In the simplest terms, the animals
are responding to they're all

00:53:26.130 --> 00:53:29.270
of a sudden in nighttime
very quickly.

00:53:29.270 --> 00:53:33.440
And so that's probably a little
bit disturbing for it to happen

00:53:33.440 --> 00:53:36.560
so quickly, but it's also
they're just responding

00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:39.770
to a totally different
environment --

00:53:39.770 --> 00:53:41.650
suddenly they think it's nighttime.

00:53:41.650 --> 00:53:43.290
But I don't think it's
anything dangerous.

00:53:43.290 --> 00:53:47.760
I mean, I'm not going to hide my
cats or anything like that, so.

00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:49.060
Yes, sir?

00:53:49.060 --> 00:53:50.960
&gt;&gt; I saw that happen in 1970.

00:53:50.960 --> 00:53:52.260
&gt;&gt; Dr. C. Alex Young: Oh, cool.

00:53:52.260 --> 00:53:54.500
&gt;&gt; And it was very strange.

00:53:54.500 --> 00:53:58.250
The birds just all of a
sudden headed for the trees.

00:53:58.250 --> 00:53:59.550
&gt;&gt; Dr. C. Alex Young: I mean,

00:53:59.550 --> 00:54:00.850
there's a lot of really
good stories.

00:54:00.850 --> 00:54:03.560 position:56%
There's actually on our website, on
the eclipse website, we have a video

00:54:03.560 --> 00:54:07.320
from a colleague, Doug Duncan,
who's seen a lot of eclipses.

00:54:07.320 --> 00:54:11.710
And he's got a really nice video
about different animal experiences.

00:54:11.710 --> 00:54:14.660
He told me a story of
once he was on a ship.

00:54:14.660 --> 00:54:19.430
And when the totality hit,
whales and dolphins surfaced

00:54:19.430 --> 00:54:25.410
and just looked up and didn't
do anything during totality.

00:54:25.410 --> 00:54:28.080
And then as soon as it was over,
they went back to their business.

00:54:28.080 --> 00:54:30.390
He said it was pretty eerie.

00:54:30.390 --> 00:54:33.720
&gt;&gt; They had their little
glasses on, right?

00:54:33.720 --> 00:54:35.020
&gt;&gt; Dr. C. Alex Young: Yes, ma'am?

00:54:35.020 --> 00:54:37.130
&gt;&gt; Can you talk about shadow bands?

00:54:37.130 --> 00:54:38.430
&gt;&gt; Dr. C. Alex Young:
I don't know a lot

00:54:38.430 --> 00:54:40.640
about shadow bands, unfortunately.

00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:44.100
I can certainly -- I've
got some great books

00:54:44.100 --> 00:54:46.550
and some great colleagues
I can point you to,

00:54:46.550 --> 00:54:48.250
but unfortunately I
don't really know a lot.

00:54:48.250 --> 00:54:50.980
Do you know anything
about shadow bands, Jim?

00:54:50.980 --> 00:54:53.430
Yeah, I don't know
anything about shadow bands.

00:54:53.430 --> 00:54:57.210
Shadow bands is this
really cool striation effect

00:54:57.210 --> 00:54:59.570
that you see during eclipses.

00:54:59.570 --> 00:55:02.520
And it's not just total eclipses;
you can see shadow bands, I think,

00:55:02.520 --> 00:55:04.880
during annular eclipses, too.

00:55:04.880 --> 00:55:09.070
But I'll be honest, I don't
really know a lot about it.

00:55:09.070 --> 00:55:12.360
But I've actually got some books
with me right here that I brought,

00:55:12.360 --> 00:55:14.550
one from Fred Espenak,
which is really good.

00:55:14.550 --> 00:55:16.390
And he would know.

00:55:16.390 --> 00:55:17.690
He's really cool.

00:55:17.690 --> 00:55:19.170
I know he would be
the kind of person

00:55:19.170 --> 00:55:23.330
that you could just send
him an email and ask him.

00:55:23.330 --> 00:55:24.730
So sorry I can't tell you more.

00:55:24.730 --> 00:55:26.830
&gt;&gt; I think we'd better
close this session.

00:55:26.830 --> 00:55:28.130
&gt;&gt; Dr. C. Alex Young: Let
me answer one more question.

00:55:28.130 --> 00:55:32.960
&gt;&gt; Is there going to be any
major ocean tide impact?

00:55:32.960 --> 00:55:34.700
&gt;&gt; Dr. C. Alex Young:
I don't think so.

00:55:34.700 --> 00:55:40.030
I mean, it's not going to be over
the ocean, first of all, that long.

00:55:40.030 --> 00:55:43.910
But I can't imagine.

00:55:43.910 --> 00:55:46.700
I'll be honest, I'm
not an expert on that.

00:55:46.700 --> 00:55:49.440
But I really can't imagine
that there would be any reason

00:55:49.440 --> 00:55:51.100
that there would be any
sort of change like that.

00:55:51.100 --> 00:55:53.460
I'm sure there would
be tiny, tiny changes

00:55:53.460 --> 00:55:56.180
but probably things we wouldn't
be able to easily measure.

00:55:56.180 --> 00:55:59.250
Yeah. So, all right,
one more question.

00:55:59.250 --> 00:56:03.040
&gt;&gt; Any advice on a place that's
not too crowded [inaudible]?

00:56:03.040 --> 00:56:05.060
[ Laughter ]

00:56:05.060 --> 00:56:07.450
&gt;&gt; Dr. C. Alex Young: Oh gosh.

00:56:07.450 --> 00:56:13.000
Well, definitely stay
away from Oregon.

00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:17.360
Maybe Idaho or Wyoming.

00:56:17.360 --> 00:56:19.010
&gt;&gt; Oh, no, I've heard
lots of people --

00:56:19.010 --> 00:56:20.310
[ Multiple Speakers ]

00:56:20.310 --> 00:56:21.610
&gt;&gt; Dr. C. Alex Young: Yeah.

00:56:21.610 --> 00:56:22.910 position:56%
I don't know that there really is --

00:56:22.910 --> 00:56:24.210
I mean, I just -- yeah,
I don't know.

00:56:24.210 --> 00:56:28.150
I think the most determining factor
should be do you have a place

00:56:28.150 --> 00:56:30.640
to stay that's within your budget?

00:56:30.640 --> 00:56:36.910
Because a lot of places are
really, really gouging people.

00:56:36.910 --> 00:56:39.260
It's actually been so
bad of an issue in Oregon

00:56:39.260 --> 00:56:42.210
that the governor got involved.

00:56:42.210 --> 00:56:47.420 position:56%
Now, strangely enough, I was talking
to a colleague in South Carolina

00:56:47.420 --> 00:56:49.650
and we were looking
online and there are a lot

00:56:49.650 --> 00:56:51.910
of places available
in South Carolina.

00:56:51.910 --> 00:56:55.150
Now, South Carolina is going
to be really populated.

00:56:55.150 --> 00:56:57.190
But if you can get it --

00:56:57.190 --> 00:57:01.740
I mean, frankly, if you can get a
hotel near the center of the path

00:57:01.740 --> 00:57:03.590
of totality, I would just go there

00:57:03.590 --> 00:57:06.650
and then step outside your
hotel room and see it.

00:57:06.650 --> 00:57:08.830
Don't worry about all the frill.

00:57:08.830 --> 00:57:11.760
Because there's a lot of
towns that have activities

00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:13.510
and events and things like that.

00:57:13.510 --> 00:57:17.300 position:56%
But if you can make sure you can get
there and you can afford the hotel,

00:57:17.300 --> 00:57:19.910
then go wherever you can go.

00:57:19.910 --> 00:57:23.400
So the best thing to do is
to be as close as you can

00:57:23.400 --> 00:57:26.030
to where you want to observe.

00:57:26.030 --> 00:57:27.750
Because then you don't
have to worry about traffic

00:57:27.750 --> 00:57:30.960
and all that kind of stuff.

00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:33.040
&gt;&gt; What about airplanes?

00:57:33.040 --> 00:57:35.060
&gt;&gt; Dr. C. Alex Young: Airplanes
-- actually, I have a colleague,

00:57:35.060 --> 00:57:37.350
Mike [inaudible], you may be
familiar there's a video that came

00:57:37.350 --> 00:57:44.870
out during the 2016 eclipse, which
was predominantly in Micronesia.

00:57:44.870 --> 00:57:48.140
He was able to -- because he used
to work for CBS and had some pull,

00:57:48.140 --> 00:57:51.780
he was able to convince
Alaskan Airlines

00:57:51.780 --> 00:57:54.920
to change the path
of their airplane.

00:57:54.920 --> 00:57:59.620
And so he flew -- they flew the
plane through the path of totality

00:57:59.620 --> 00:58:01.830
and he made a video of it.

00:58:01.830 --> 00:58:05.010
And he's famous for being
the "Oh, my God" guy.

00:58:05.010 --> 00:58:08.010
Because he said oh my God
about 22 times, I think.

00:58:08.010 --> 00:58:09.400
[ Laughter ]

00:58:09.400 --> 00:58:14.720
And it was picked up by CBS,
became sort of a viral video.

00:58:14.720 --> 00:58:17.370
He's a huge avid eclipse chaser.

00:58:17.370 --> 00:58:18.670
He's been seeing eclipses --

00:58:18.670 --> 00:58:22.390
when he was a kid he
went to the '79 eclipse.

00:58:22.390 --> 00:58:25.450
So you can find ones
that are in the path.

00:58:25.450 --> 00:58:26.750
It's not necessarily easy.

00:58:26.750 --> 00:58:28.670
I will say if you're
truly interested in that,

00:58:28.670 --> 00:58:33.340
my colleague Sten Odenwald,
who's amazing with numbers,

00:58:33.340 --> 00:58:37.590
and he sat down and figured out
all the airplanes that were going

00:58:37.590 --> 00:58:40.160
to probably be in the
path of totality.

00:58:40.160 --> 00:58:44.340
So he's got a spreadsheet
of that, you know?

00:58:44.340 --> 00:58:45.640
It looks really cool.

00:58:45.640 --> 00:58:46.940
The video is amazing.

00:58:46.940 --> 00:58:49.050 position:56%
Now, of course, you won't
experience the environmental issues.

00:58:49.050 --> 00:58:53.240
But they were above the clouds
and you can see the shadow coming

00:58:53.240 --> 00:58:55.170
in a way that I've not
seen in any other video

00:58:55.170 --> 00:58:58.610
because you don't have any of
the terrain to worry about.

00:58:58.610 --> 00:59:01.080
So it was pretty spectacular.

00:59:01.080 --> 00:59:06.950
So I actually looked into trying
to get on one of the NASA planes,

00:59:06.950 --> 00:59:12.040 position:56%
but all the high-upies were the ones
that get to be on the NASA plane.

00:59:12.040 --> 00:59:15.810
I couldn't carry luggage or
anything like that to do it.

00:59:15.810 --> 00:59:20.390
But it's worth a try, yeah.

00:59:20.390 --> 00:59:22.190
&gt;&gt; One more?

00:59:22.190 --> 00:59:23.490
&gt;&gt; Dr. C. Alex Young:
One more, okay.

00:59:23.490 --> 00:59:25.760
&gt;&gt; What are the special
glasses made of?

00:59:25.760 --> 00:59:27.520
&gt;&gt; Dr. C. Alex Young:
They're just made

00:59:27.520 --> 00:59:30.440
of a particular type of plastic.

00:59:30.440 --> 00:59:31.740
I don't know the details.

00:59:31.740 --> 00:59:35.470
I will say the thing to note,
there's an ISO standard.

00:59:35.470 --> 00:59:37.540
So the back of the
glasses should say ISO,

00:59:37.540 --> 00:59:39.320
and I don't remember
the exact number,

00:59:39.320 --> 00:59:42.000
but it should have
ISO standard on it.

00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:44.920
Older ones will have CE --
that's a European standard that's

00:59:44.920 --> 00:59:46.420
still acceptable.

00:59:46.420 --> 00:59:51.280
But currently the ISO standard
is the international standard.

00:59:51.280 --> 00:59:56.100
So if you go to our website,
we have a joint safety bulletin

00:59:56.100 --> 01:00:00.180
with the AAS, NSF, and
the American Optometrist

01:00:00.180 --> 01:00:02.220
and Ophthalmology Societies.

01:00:02.220 --> 01:00:07.070
We list the four major
producers that we know.

01:00:07.070 --> 01:00:08.370
They're not the only ones,

01:00:08.370 --> 01:00:10.940
but they're the ones we
know are ISO certified.

01:00:10.940 --> 01:00:12.920
And you can go to those.

01:00:12.920 --> 01:00:14.380
They sell all kinds of glasses.

01:00:14.380 --> 01:00:19.840
And places like Lunt, L-u-n-t,
are one of the people that I know.

01:00:19.840 --> 01:00:23.000
They sell -- they're not the only
people -- but they sell, like,

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.330
the binoculars that actually
have the built-in filters.

01:00:25.330 --> 01:00:27.660 position:56%
And they're, like, $25 or something.

01:00:27.660 --> 01:00:28.960
They're not that expensive.

01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:32.160
So there's a lot of really
cool options out there.

01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:33.510
So thanks a lot, everybody.

01:00:33.510 --> 01:00:34.810
I really appreciate it.

01:00:34.810 --> 01:00:37.510
Thanks for waiting for me, so.
