00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.073
My name is Wendy Bravo.
I'm a licensed psychotherapist.

00:00:04.169 --> 00:00:07.417
This is Katia, my daughter.
She's 11 years old.

00:00:07.513 --> 00:00:09.944
If you want to learn Android,
definitely take

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.319
the Android Development
for Beginners class first.

00:00:13.414 --> 00:00:15.159
They teach you really clearly,

00:00:15.222 --> 00:00:18.870
and for those who have no idea
about programming,

00:00:18.966 --> 00:00:21.711
they take it
step by step through.

00:00:21.807 --> 00:00:24.830
The class really breaks down,
from the beginning,

00:00:24.926 --> 00:00:29.505
every single thing that you need
to know to keep advancing.

00:00:29.563 --> 00:00:31.045
And once you start doing it,

00:00:31.141 --> 00:00:33.573
and then you get to the point
where you actually see

00:00:33.669 --> 00:00:37.350
what you've been writing running
on your phone, it's like, "wow!".

00:00:37.429 --> 00:00:39.526
There's this Just Java class,

00:00:39.622 --> 00:00:41.839
where it's like
a coffee-ordering app.

00:00:41.935 --> 00:00:45.379
I decided to take it
a little further,

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:50.550
add some more stuff I want to add
with my newfound knowledge.

00:00:50.878 --> 00:00:54.310
The other piece I really like is
how they talk about making errors,

00:00:54.406 --> 00:00:56.431
how it's part of the programming.

00:00:56.527 --> 00:00:58.672
But the class
really makes you experience it.

00:00:58.768 --> 00:01:00.679
And I think for me
that's the biggest difference.

00:01:00.775 --> 00:01:01.935
When you get to experience it

00:01:02.002 --> 00:01:04.002
and you really have
that little tension...

00:01:04.098 --> 00:01:07.277
"OK, where is it?
How am I going to fix this thing?"

00:01:07.334 --> 00:01:10.068
Once you actually fix it,
the more you struggle...

00:01:10.164 --> 00:01:11.892
you feel even better then.

00:01:11.988 --> 00:01:14.518
The instructors
make it really clear

00:01:14.614 --> 00:01:19.624
and make it fun to learn,
at the same time.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.833
Overall, the experience
was really great.

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:26.149
If I started and learned
after so many years

00:01:26.216 --> 00:01:29.682
in a completely different career
that had nothing to do with it,

00:01:29.778 --> 00:01:34.235
being intimidated, having all
these erroneous beliefs about it,

00:01:34.331 --> 00:01:37.572
if even with all that
I was able to learn,

00:01:37.668 --> 00:01:38.869
I think anyone can do it.
