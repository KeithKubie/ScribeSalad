00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Okay, let's see.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Well, on the bottom I know this has to be a plus sign.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
If this were a minus sign, the denominator could go to 0 when the masses were equal.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Dividing by 0 is something that I don't know how to do.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
What about up here? It seems like there must be some situations where if you 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
set this up just right, nothing happens.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
The whole setup is static--aka the acceleration is 0.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
The only way we can get a 0 in the numerator is if we put a minus sign here.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Now it's just a matter of saying, well, if m2 is really, really big I expect a positive acceleration.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
The system will accelerate in the direction that m2 wants to accelerate.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
That happens here.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
If m1 is really big, I want a negative acceleration. 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
I expect the system to accelerate that way.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
That happens when the thing we're subtracting --this term--gets really large,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
which means this had better be an m1.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Then when m1 is big this term will get big.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
If you solved this by doing F = ma on both of these blocks

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and got this answer, I'm especially impressed

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
and I totally encourage you to go to the forums and share your answers with your classmates.
