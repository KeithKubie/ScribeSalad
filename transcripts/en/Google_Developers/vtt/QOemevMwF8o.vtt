00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:17.050
MALE SPEAKER: Shanghai
GDG is a very

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:18.850
interesting developer community.

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:19.980
FEMALE SPEAKER: I'm
glad somebody

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.000
has asked this question.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.380
MALE SPEAKER: This is where
the magic happens.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.700
FEMALE SPEAKER: This is
primarily a question and

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.590
answer show, so if any
of you out there

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:26.840
would like to ask questions.

00:00:31.858 --> 00:00:33.290
STEVE BAZYL: Hi, everyone.

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:34.805
I'm Steven Bazyl.

00:00:34.805 --> 00:00:36.050
ALAIN VONGSUVANH: I'm
Alain Vongsuvanh.

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.270
STEVE BAZYL: And today, we're
going to do an app review of

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.110
what I think is actually
a really cool app.

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:42.685
This is InstallFree Nexus.

00:00:42.685 --> 00:00:45.700
They actually have two versions
of this app, one with

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.720
LibreOffice, another one
with Microsoft Office.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.550
We're going to take a look at
the LibreOffice version today.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.250
I think it's actually
a really cool app.

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.090
Have you had a chance to play
around with this much?

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.240
ALAIN VONGSUVANH: Yeah, this
is really nice, because as

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.490
we're moving towards storing our
files in the cloud, many

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:04.640
of us have Legacy files
on our hard drive.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.080
It's true that Google Docs and
Google Drive has a doc editor

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.870
which nice to use, but users
want to be able to open the

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.140
Legacy files and edit
them on the web.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.730
STEVE BAZYL: So if you have
something where maybe the

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.200
formatting is a little too
complicated for us, then you

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.090
actually can use the real
version of those products in

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:24.860
the web, and it's actually
really cool.

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.670
So let's just take a look at
their Chrome listing page.

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.820
You're going to see here,
InstallFree Nexus with

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.832
LibreOffice and some
screenshots.

00:01:33.832 --> 00:01:35.880
I already have the app
installed, so I'm not going to

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.560
go through that entire
process.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.650
But I just wanted to show it's
a pretty well-done page here

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.020
that explains the app, and
similarly, with the Office

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.230
version as well.

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:49.590
Really important to have these
Chrome Web Store pages for

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.380
people to discover your apps
and explain what they do.

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.240
But really, we care about
the app itself

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.960
and some of the features.

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.590
Here I have in my drive
just a couple files

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.980
that I created earlier.

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.020
Let's just see what this
experience is like.

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.290
So let's go create a
LibreOffice file.

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:13.750
And you're going to see here an
interesting design issue.

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.410
And this is partly the way the
product works and partly a

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.940
limitation in the Drive SDK.

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.270
But you see here that I have to
choose what type of while I

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.970
want to create.

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.980
And I think it would be nice
if we had this in the SDK,

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:26.810
where we could actually--

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.765
ALAIN VONGSUVANH: Create
new presentations.

00:02:28.765 --> 00:02:30.400
STEVE BAZYL: Exactly.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.890
Have multiple actions
in the UI.

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.890
But right now, because they want
this to be one install

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.000
action for the users,
they have to have

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.980
this in their app.

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.140
But something we can improve
upon in the SDK, but I think

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.830
they handled it really well
given that limitation.

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.990
And let's just create a doc.

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.890
The cool thing about this is
what they're actually doing is

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.650
spinning up LibreOffice in a
virtual machine in the cloud

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.030
and giving us remote desktop,
RDP, in our browser.

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.960
That's actually kind of
mind blowing when

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:00.750
you think about it.

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.420
ALAIN VONGSUVANH: First time
you run it, it's just like,

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.230
whoa, you're running
a desktop?

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.020
STEVE BAZYL: Exactly.

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:06.650
So we have the full
version of this.

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.210
If we were doing the Office
version, we'd have just

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:13.850
regular Microsoft Office
running in our browser.

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:15.680
And we can just start
typing away.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.600
[TYPING]

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.870
STEVE BAZYL: So not a very
exciting doc, but

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.670
let's go and save it.

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:30.090
And here, we'll save in our
Documents, and give it a nice

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.785
little file name.

00:03:32.785 --> 00:03:34.550
Having a little trouble
typing today.

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.780
And it should be saving.

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.800
And here we go.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:45.470
There's the file.

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.010
We have our file we created.

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:53.050
We can close that, open it
back up, and we should be

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:55.070
right back to where we did.

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:56.980
One of the issues with running
an app like this that is a

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:03.070
little heavy, the startup time
is slower than using a full

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:04.830
web-based editor like
Google Docs.

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.870
So you have a little bit a
trade-off in terms of startup

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.380
time versus features and

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:10.980
functionality, but here we are.

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.525
We're back to where we
were with our file.

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:20.870
Earlier I created this
directory, and this actually

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.160
goes back to a GDL that
we did last week.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.700
It was Ali and I, and we talked
about the differences

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.360
of drive versus a file system.

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.520
And some of the issues--

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.800
one, in particular, is
disambiguating files because

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.090
we don't have this restriction
that file names are unique.

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:44.630
So what do you think is going to
happen when we open this up

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:46.830
in this directory
in LibreOffice?

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.060
ALAIN VONGSUVANH: As I can see,
you have two files with

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.970
the same name, so I guess you're
going to have a hard

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:56.800
time handling this, and only
show one of the two.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:57.700
Which one?

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:58.940
I don't know.

00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:59.910
STEVE BAZYL: Yeah, Well,
that's a good question.

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:02.200
So let's go in here.

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.280
And you can see here, they
actually created basically a

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.090
virtual file system in Windows,
and I can just

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:10.110
navigate through my drive
content here.

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:14.210
And as you guessed, they
only show one file.

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:16.040
Unfortunately, I don't know
which one they've actually

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:19.710
shown without actually
opening this up.

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:21.660
So what should they
do in this case?

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:25.750
ALAIN VONGSUVANH: They should
show both of the files, maybe

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:30.845
having a way to identify that
those two files are different.

00:05:30.845 --> 00:05:34.930
STEVE BAZYL: So putting like a
suffix on one of them with

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:36.530
like a version or time stamp--

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:36.630
ALAIN VONGSUVANH: Yeah.

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:39.030
STEVE BAZYL: --or something
like that?

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:42.610
So this is actually a pretty
significant issue.

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:46.620
It looks like they probably
should have about the same

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:47.680
time stamp.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:48.905
Not entirely sure which
one that is.

00:05:48.905 --> 00:05:50.910
ALAIN VONGSUVANH: You can
save it and see what the

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:51.570
new time stamp is.

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:52.770
STEVE BAZYL: That's true.

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:56.071
Let's actually do that
and see what happens.

00:05:56.071 --> 00:05:56.910
Oh, interesting.

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:59.490
They're giving me--

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:01.967
let's modify it first
and then save it.

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:07.380
And, there we go.

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:09.140
So it was this one.

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:13.340
So, yeah, it's a little bit of
a wart on the user experience

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:16.280
there, in that if you do have
files with the same name, it's

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:18.960
a little bit difficult, or
actually nearly impossible, to

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:22.650
make sense of what happens
in that case.

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:25.880
The good part, though, is that
you can access the application

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:28.590
fully from within
the Drive UI.

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:33.830
They also have their own file
viewer inside their web

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:36.020
application which lets
you navigate.

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:37.090
And in this case,
they actually do

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:38.780
display the files correctly.

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:44.240
So it's just within that virtual
file system where it's

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:47.900
not quite handled entirely
correct.

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:49.940
So to make this possible, one of
the things I have to do is

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:52.130
request access to
all my files.

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:53.450
What are your thoughts
on that?

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:55.550
Is that the right decision
in this case?

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:58.060
ALAIN VONGSUVANH: We're trying
to move away from the broader

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:00.120
scope which gives an
app access to an

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:01.820
entire user's drive.

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:04.920
But as we are building a virtual
file system, they

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:08.950
don't have a choice but to
request access to another

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:10.552
user's drive.

00:07:10.552 --> 00:07:14.660
One other way we could do it is
only list files they have

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:18.105
access to or created, but that
will limit the user experience

00:07:18.105 --> 00:07:19.030
for the application.

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:19.920
STEVE BAZYL: Right.

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:25.180
So in that case, if they were
to do a file open from this,

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:28.580
all their Legacy files that
they haven't yet launched

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:30.240
probably wouldn't show up
in this case, right?

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:30.650
ALAIN VONGSUVANH: Yes.

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:34.110
STEVE BAZYL: So, it's an
interesting challenge for apps

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:36.450
like this, where they need to
have an integrated File

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:42.400
Explorer, but I think the value
of having this actually

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:45.830
behave like a real desktop
application and then look like

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:48.170
it has a file system probably
was the right

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:49.870
decision for them.

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:53.040
But they could have done a more
restricted version that

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:54.495
doesn't require as
much permission.

00:07:54.495 --> 00:07:57.110
ALAIN VONGSUVANH: And that
uses the picker API.

00:07:57.110 --> 00:08:00.630
STEVE BAZYL: Yeah, that
would be interesting.

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:02.880
Any thoughts on ways that they
would be able to get the

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:07.220
picker to work inside a native
desktop experience like this?

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:09.670
ALAIN VONGSUVANH: It should be
hard, because they'll have to

00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:14.190
fire the picker on the client
side, on the browser, and ask

00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:18.190
the user to choose a file, and
send it back to the server.

00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:22.000
So it won't really show as
a native file picker.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.525
It will show with the Google
Picker API UI.

00:08:26.525 --> 00:08:27.630
STEVE BAZYL: Yeah.

00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:29.840
I think it would be an
interesting experiment to

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:32.000
figure out if that
is possible.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.510
And personally, I'm not familiar
enough with the

00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:39.299
OpenOffice and Office APIs to
know how easy it is to plug in

00:08:39.299 --> 00:08:43.120
or replace those menu options.

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:45.370
But I think it would be
something that would be a good

00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:49.020
experiment for somebody to try
and see if that's possible.

00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:51.760
It definitely would help a lot
on the security side to be

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:54.310
able to switch over
to that more

00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:56.565
restrictive per file access.

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:01.710
Let's just take a quick look at
some of the other editors.

00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:03.155
We can create another one.

00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:07.780
What do you want to
create this time?

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:08.445
We can do a spreadsheet.

00:09:08.445 --> 00:09:10.530
We can do a presentation.

00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:14.285
ALAIN VONGSUVANH: What
do you think?

00:09:14.285 --> 00:09:16.155
STEVE BAZYL: How about
we do a drawing?

00:09:16.155 --> 00:09:16.680
ALAIN VONGSUVANH:
Drawing, yeah.

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:18.350
Never tried this one.

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:20.850
STEVE BAZYL: You actually have
access to the full suite.

00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:22.120
And again, you have
the Microsoft

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:24.470
version of these as well.

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:27.574
And let's see if my art
skills are any good.

00:09:27.574 --> 00:09:29.775
ALAIN VONGSUVANH: You
need a trackpad?

00:09:29.775 --> 00:09:30.525
STEVE BAZYL: Yeah.

00:09:30.525 --> 00:09:35.420
I have a feeling I'm going to do
a not so good job here, but

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:38.271
you can draw some lines.

00:09:38.271 --> 00:09:41.180
Oops.

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:43.800
Maybe this was the wrong demo
to do, as I am not very

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:46.950
familiar with the OpenOffice
drawing here.

00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:51.940
Here's some tools down here.

00:09:51.940 --> 00:10:01.000
So we'll draw a very, very,
very simple smiley face.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.170
ALAIN VONGSUVANH: You're
back to selecting.

00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:07.130
STEVE BAZYL: LibreOffice is not
making me very happy here.

00:10:12.296 --> 00:10:15.570
I have terrible, terrible
art skills.

00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:22.850
There's my slightly happy,
slightly upset smiley face.

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:28.640
And we could do spreadsheets
as well, presentations.

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:31.350
And this actually handles not
just LibreOffice, but I think

00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:34.540
they actually do conversions on
Microsoft formats and other

00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:35.650
common formats as well.

00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:39.960
So a really powerful application
for working with a

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:43.740
lot of files that you may have
had on your desktop before and

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:45.740
you're moving into the cloud.

00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:48.060
If you're not quite ready to
convert those over to Google

00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:52.810
Doc formats, something like
InstallFree Nexus is a really

00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:57.875
good transitional tool to get
you into the cloud, but

00:10:57.875 --> 00:11:02.570
without having to fully commit
to converting those into a

00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:04.915
format that's in Google Docs.

00:11:04.915 --> 00:11:07.060
ALAIN VONGSUVANH: But you still
get the features of

00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:08.260
Google Drive, like sharing.

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:09.000
STEVE BAZYL: Yeah.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.180
ALAIN VONGSUVANH: You don't get
collaborating, but you can

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:14.360
share a file with another user,
and they can use the

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:19.060
same app as long as they have it
installed and open it with

00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:19.890
LibreOffice as well.

00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:20.810
STEVE BAZYL: Exactly right.

00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:24.010
So we can share this with other
users using the same

00:11:24.010 --> 00:11:27.380
sharing features of any
file and drive.

00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:31.700
Once that user gets it, they'll
actually get alerted

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:33.840
that this file was created
by that application.

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:37.350
They'll have an opportunity to
install it and start taking

00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:39.810
advantage of it.

00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:42.120
So is there anything else
about this that you

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:43.020
want to show off?

00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:46.045
I think you were curious about
be the approval screen.

00:11:46.045 --> 00:11:48.105
ALAIN VONGSUVANH: Yes, the codes
they are requesting.

00:11:48.105 --> 00:11:49.650
STEVE BAZYL: So let's just
take a look at that.

00:11:49.650 --> 00:11:54.860
What we'll do is just revoke
this here temporarily.

00:11:54.860 --> 00:12:02.230
I'll remove, and then we can go
back to Chrome Web Store,

00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:03.650
add it back in.

00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:12.550
And we'll do a little refresh.

00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:15.610
So in theory, this time
I should get a prompt.

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:17.280
So here's the full list
of all the things

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:19.380
that they're accessing.

00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:24.350
So we have account information
for single sign-on, full

00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:25.870
access to all of
our documents.

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:28.320
So again, you can see just how
much data they're actually

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:29.630
asking for here.

00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:32.870
All of our documents, they can
download anything, create,

00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:34.490
move, all that stuff.

00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:37.840
And you can see why there's
so much emphasis on moving

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:40.620
towards the per file scope,
because this really is a lot

00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:42.250
of power that you're giving
the applications.

00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:46.260
And it's really nice from a user
perspective to be able to

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:50.300
say I only want to give you
access to the handful of files

00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:52.576
that are really important
for your app.

00:12:52.576 --> 00:12:53.230
What else?

00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:54.810
Everything else looks
pretty normal--

00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:59.650
email address, spreadsheets,
photos and videos.

00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:02.360
So they actually have a lot
of functionality in here.

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:04.470
And we haven't even really
looked at some of the photo

00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:08.040
capabilities, but I think they
actually pull in some stuff

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:09.930
from Picasa and so on as well.

00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:12.988
ALAIN VONGSUVANH: So you
can integrate in a doc.

00:13:12.988 --> 00:13:14.000
STEVE BAZYL: Yeah,
that's true.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:14.630
Right.

00:13:14.630 --> 00:13:15.530
Yeah, exactly.

00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:19.495
Import photos into a
documentation, and so on.

00:13:19.495 --> 00:13:23.860
So, we'll just grant access
again, and we're back to where

00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:25.840
we started.

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:28.820
So what are the things you would
like to see in the app?

00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:32.242
Is there anything other than the
issue we saw earlier with

00:13:32.242 --> 00:13:33.880
the virtual file system?

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:36.850
Any features or things that
you would like them to do

00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:37.935
differently?

00:13:37.935 --> 00:13:41.010
ALAIN VONGSUVANH: Do you know
if they use the revision

00:13:41.010 --> 00:13:43.750
features on Google Drive?

00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:46.980
STEVE BAZYL: That's a really
good question.

00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:51.370
Certainly, I haven't seen
anything within the app for

00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:52.810
doing this.

00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:55.610
I know some of the Office
formats have revisions built

00:13:55.610 --> 00:13:58.500
into the file itself.

00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:01.960
But we should be able to go into
here, for example, and

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:08.410
say Revisions, and it is
actually creating them.

00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:11.220
So this is just a feature of
Drive, and I believe by

00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:12.806
default, we do create
a new revision.

00:14:12.806 --> 00:14:14.160
ALAIN VONGSUVANH: On
every update, yes.

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:15.900
STEVE BAZYL: So, they didn't
really have to do anything

00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:18.370
special to get that.

00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:20.340
So I can go in here
and I can do this.

00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:24.260
Or if it's a file format that
has built-in revision history,

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:27.420
we can use that as well.

00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:31.440
But it's a really amazing
app, I think.

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:36.850
Just the fact that this is a
remote desktop, the full

00:14:36.850 --> 00:14:40.010
version of these applications in
a browser, and they're not

00:14:40.010 --> 00:14:42.030
really running any special
plugins or anything.

00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:48.040
I think it's just Canvas and
WebSockets, and it works on

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:48.350
Chromebooks.

00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:51.280
It works on a full browser
like Chrome

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:53.290
ALAIN VONGSUVANH: As long as
you have a modem browser,

00:14:53.290 --> 00:14:54.265
you're good to go.

00:14:54.265 --> 00:14:56.000
STEVE BAZYL: Exactly.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.640
And it really is just, I think,
a crucial piece in

00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:03.480
getting people from the desktop
into the cloud and

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:07.130
onto truly being able to
work from any device.

00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:08.700
The only thing I haven't
tried this on,

00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:12.190
actually, is a mobile device.

00:15:12.190 --> 00:15:16.160
I'm not optimistic that it's
going to be a great experience

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:18.730
running Office on
a mobile phone.

00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:21.680
But it might actually be OK on
a tablet and something that

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:27.090
we'll give a try and let
folks know how it goes.

00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:31.120
But definitely something I'm
really excited about, and just

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:32.860
an overall solid app.

00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:36.240
They do have to fix some
technical issues.

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:40.050
And if you're watching our
friends at InstallFree, you

00:15:40.050 --> 00:15:43.500
can take a look at last week's
GDL on file systems and

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:49.120
disambiguation and hopefully
fix that one little issue.

00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:51.636
Any final thoughts?

00:15:51.636 --> 00:15:54.490
ALAIN VONGSUVANH: Again, as
you've been mentioning many

00:15:54.490 --> 00:15:57.680
times, I think this is a really
good app to have.

00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:01.310
It helps users move away from
Legacy file systems and into

00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:05.690
the cloud, have the files backed
up in a secure server,

00:16:05.690 --> 00:16:08.480
and have the files accessed
everywhere.

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:11.950
They can use sharing to share
files instead of sending a

00:16:11.950 --> 00:16:16.470
specific file via email, have
multiple users edit those

00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:22.600
files using the same app, and
see what other users do on the

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:26.830
same file instead of sending a
file, getting it back, trying

00:16:26.830 --> 00:16:29.561
to merge for revisions,
et cetera.

00:16:29.561 --> 00:16:30.030
STEVE BAZYL: Yeah.

00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:33.480
So I think that's
it for today.

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:35.000
Thank you, everyone,
for coming, and

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.230
we'll be back on Thursday.

00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:40.870
I don't know if the topic has
been set, but I'm sure it will

00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:41.890
be a very good GDL again.

00:16:41.890 --> 00:16:45.866
So, thanks for watching
and stay tuned.

00:16:45.866 --> 00:17:14.000
