VEYSEL GUREN: Today
I'm going to tell you

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:09.890
about how we created a native
application using WordPress

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:12.610
REST API and Android Volley.

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:15.290
Nefisyemektarifleri.com
was in a search

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:18.030
of a professional mobile
technology company,

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:21.500
and they chose us regarding
our professional and innovative

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:22.740
works.

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.080
The challenge here
was that they were

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.870
using a highly-customized
WordPress package,

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:30.750
and creating a native app
would need web services

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.260
and networking system.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.390
The challenge here was
that Nefis Yemek Tarifleri

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.200
website was deployed
on WordPress,

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.660
and it was highly customized.

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.490
So WordPress does not
have a default web service

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:48.650
system for an Android app.

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:54.120
So we have used WordPress
REST API and Android Volley

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.080
for creating an Android app.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.060
Actually, WordPress doesn't
have a default web service

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.300
system for REST API.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.660
So we have enabled WordPress
API for enabling REST services.

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:13.360
Actually, REST API is just
serving data with JSON,

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:19.840
and we are getting this data
and interpreting as objects.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.080
This plug-in provides
an easy-to-use REST API

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.360
available via HTTP.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.670
Correct your site's data
in simple JSON format,

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.350
including users, posts,
taxonomies, and more.

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:37.720
Retrieving or updating data is
as simple as sending an HTTP

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.580
request.

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.700
We used WP API as the
web service technology

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.600
for sending requests
to websites and getting

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.410
responses in JSON format.

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.040
Android Volley is
an HTTP library

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.190
that makes networking
easier and faster.

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:01.050
Volley is available through
the open AOSP repository.

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.100
Volley offers benefits
including automatic scheduling

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.229
of network requests, multiple
concurrent network connections,

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.600
transparent disk and memory
response caching, and support

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.300
for request superiority.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.730
We used Volley for
enabling networking.

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.705
Web service responses coming
as JSON is parsed using JSON

00:02:22.705 --> 00:02:26.880
and becomes ready for being
used as objects within coding.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:32.250
It is easy to embed Volley, and
it supplies high performance.

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.830
In conclusion, we have developed
a native Android app that

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.650
is used by one million people.

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.480
And everyday, lots of people
are checking what and how

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.900
to cook from this Android app.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.550
