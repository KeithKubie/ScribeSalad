00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.560
An example of a large-scale situation awareness

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:08.450
application would be monitoring, for instance, activities

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:13.080
in an airport. And in that situation what we are trying to make sure

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.910
is that normal activities are okay, but

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:19.880
anything anomalous, with respect to what we

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:26.260
see in the environment has to result in triggers being sent to the appropriate

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:32.340
software agents or even humans, in terms of actions they may need to take. And

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.150
camera networks are becoming ubiquitous. For instance,

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:37.930
in the city of London, there is on

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.760
the order of 400,000 cameras that are

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.300
deployed, blanketing the city. And the intent in

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.010
such camera networks is to analyze the

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.590
camera streams to, to detect for anomalous situations.

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.540
When you have such a large number of sensors the first thing that one has

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.260
to worry about is overloading the infrastructure

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.150
itself with the amount of data that is

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.310
being continuously produced 24/7 from all of

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.190
these sensors. That suggests that it is important

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:17.760
to prune these sensor streams at the source in order to make sure that the

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.930
infrastructure overload is avoided. And the

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.300
traditional way to do surveillance is to

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.660
have humans sitting in front of banks

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.310
of monitors looking for any anomalous activity,

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.530
for instance, in an airport. This obviously does not scale if you have on the

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.060
order of 100,000 or 200,000 cameras blanketing a city, which is becoming fairly

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.940
common in many large cities like New York, Chicago, London, and so on. And

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.805
so, cognitive overhead is another big thing that you have to worry about in

00:01:51.805 --> 00:01:57.000
large-scale situation awareness applications. And it is extremely important to

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.213
avoid false positives and false negatives. With false positives we are

00:02:02.213 --> 00:02:08.330
identifying events that are not really anomalous,

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.630
but the system thinks that it is an

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.100
anomalous event. That's a false positive and similarly,

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.940
false negative is saying, well, there is an

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.010
event that should have been caught but, but did

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.290
not get caught and that's a false negative.

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.580
So both of these are very, very important

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.210
metrics that one has to measure in large

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:33.900
scale situation awareness applications. From a programming model perspective,

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.390
one of the important take aways

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.740
in just the discussion about large-scale awareness

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:44.460
application is that the programming infrastructure has

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.460
to facilitate the domain expert who is

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:51.450
developing a large-scale situation awareness application to

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.110
be able to deal with time sensitive

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.780
data. So what are the pain points

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.610
in developing large scale situation awareness applications?

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.950
The first thing is providing the right level of abstractions, promoting ease of

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.286
use. Simplicity is the key. Interfaces

00:03:08.286 --> 00:03:13.100
that allow seamless migration of computation between

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:19.430
the edge of the network and the computational resources in a data center,

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.140
for instance. Temporal ordering of events that

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.690
are taking place in the distributed system,

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.970
and propagating temporal causality. By that, what I

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.660
mean is if an event, let's say, was captured

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.720
by a camera at a particular point of time, it make be processed at a later point

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:43.350
of time in real time but there's got to be a temporal causality for the time at

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:47.140
which it was captured and the digest of information

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.040
that was created. And such temporal causality is extremely

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.080
important in the development of large-scale situation

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:01.000
awareness applications. Another requirement in such large-scale situation

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.270
awareness application is that there are live data

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:05.720
that we are dealing with, but at the

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.590
same time we may also have to correlate

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:11.810
that with historical data in order to make

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:13.900
a high-level inference as to what's going on.

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.320
For instance, if we see a speeding car

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:21.490
at this point of time on the highway we may want to ask the question, was this

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:27.740
car involved in an incident in the last n days? And that is kind of

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.750
historical data that has to be correlated with

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.780
live data. So a programming infrastructure that provides

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.750
facility for these kinds of things would make

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.640
the life of the domain expert, writing such large-scale

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:45.100
situation awareness applications, so much simpler.
