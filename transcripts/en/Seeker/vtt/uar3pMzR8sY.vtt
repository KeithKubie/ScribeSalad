00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.540
It's called a teratoma....and it's literally
the most terrifying thing I've ever heard

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:06.040
about in my life.

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:14.190
Hello hello everyone, Laci Green here for
DNews.

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.890
When you think of places where you might find
TEETH growing, I bet your...brain...doesn't

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:19.890
come to mind.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.940
But that's exactly what happened last week
in Maryland in the body of a 4 month old infant.

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:26.590
The baby had a brain tumor, and when doctors
went to remove it, they found several fully

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:30.640
formed teeth in there, similar to the teeth
normally found in the lower jaw.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.290
The baby is now in recovery.

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.899
It's a WTF moment that is currently making
my whole week.

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:38.150
Nature is a beautiful freak, yall.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.829
Why --or how-- on earth were there teeth growing
in his brain?

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:45.739
While the exact causes are unknown, scientists
have hypothesized that the reason teeth might

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:50.630
grow in a tumor is because the tumors themselves
develop from the same cells that create teeth.

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:55.649
This case is a particularly ~strange~ occurrence
because teeth have never been found in a craniopharyngioma,

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.460
which is the rare brain tumor the infant had.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.329
However, this isn't the first time doctors
have found teeth growing in strange places....

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:06.069
Take the bizarre case of Miguel Belcon, who
had always had breathing troubles growing

00:01:06.069 --> 00:01:07.689
up that were blamed on his heavy weight.

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:12.709
When he was 18, he began coughing up blood,
leading scientists to find a basketball sized

00:01:12.709 --> 00:01:17.479
tumor in his chest, which was growing not
only teeth, but hair, and what may have been

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:20.029
the beginnings of fetal eyes.

00:01:20.029 --> 00:01:23.979
He lost nearly 30 pounds from the surgery
and is now doing a-OK.

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:27.960
Another 23 year old woman in India was born
with an abnormal left eye, which continued

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.689
to swell throughout her youth.

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:33.499
Finally, desperate and losing her vision,
she went to the doctors and found out that

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:37.590
she had a tumor in her eye which had grown
2 fully formed teeth.

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.859
While it's EXTREMELY rare, she was not the
first to have teeth growing in her eyes -- there

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:44.609
have been 70 cases documented since 1850.

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:48.499
The types of tumor in question with these
cases were teratoma tumors, which, unlike

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:53.509
a craniopharyngioma, contain all 3 types of
tissue that are found in human embryos.

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:57.039
They're an aggressive (but usually benign)
type of tumor that can pop up all over the

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:59.950
body -- like the brain, lungs, or liver.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:01.509
But what about....the vagina?

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:05.840
Yes, I am referring to so-called "vagina dentata"".

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.099
Is there some truth in there?

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:11.110
This 21st century folklore has endured all
the way from Ancient Greek mythology.

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.600
The story goes that women's bodies have secret
abilities that are quite dangerous - and having

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.720
sex with her could result in male castration.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.180
If there was ever a story that summed up the
enduring fear of female sexuality throughout

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.689
history, this is the one.

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:28.790
Although.....teeth HAVE been found growing
in ~ovaries~ so.... better be on the lookout

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:29.790
just in case ;)

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.810
