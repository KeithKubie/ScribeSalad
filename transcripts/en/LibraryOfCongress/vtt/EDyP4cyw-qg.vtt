00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.680
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.950
&gt;&gt; Ladies and gentlemen,
how I'd like to thank you

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:27.250
for attending this event.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.670
We have two special
guests here with us today.

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:35.260
They truly don't need an
introduction but I will do my best

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:36.810
to make a quick introduction.

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:40.810 position:56%
With us is Congresswoman Anna Eshoo,

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:42.930
Congresswoman Anna
Eshoo from California.

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.960
She has been a true
advocate of the Assyrians.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.940
Anytime our community
has needed something,

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.520
anytime there's been a help,

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.480
she's always been the first
door we've knocked on.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.410
She has worked tirelessly for
our community and we can't begin

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.960
to thank her enough for
everything that she's done.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.360
I'd like to invite Mr. Carlo
Gunja [assumed spelling] here

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.580
for a second with me please.

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.520
Congresswoman Eshoo, if
you would mind stepping

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.700
up here with us for one second.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.330
We'd like to present you with a
plaque to show our appreciation

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.950
for all of the wonderful work
that you've done to our community.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.110
Mr. Carlo Gunja [assumed
spelling], Congresswoman Eshoo.

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.860
&gt;&gt; Rep. Anna Eshoo: Oh,
isn't that beautiful?

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.310
Isn't that beautiful?

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.140
Do you want to say something?

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.940
&gt;&gt; Mr. Carlo Gunja: No.

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:42.730
[ Applause ]

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:44.030
&gt;&gt; Rep. Anna Eshoo: Thank you.

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:49.670
Isn't that beautiful?

00:01:49.670 --> 00:02:00.710
I'm going to put this here so you
can get a close-up shot of it.

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.370
[ Foreign language ]

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.170
I never thought that I would
be at the Library of Congress

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.480
and speaking Assyrian, so
this is really wonderful.

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.080
Good afternoon everyone.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.460
It's always a special privilege
to walk across the street

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:24.150 position:56%
from the House of Representatives
and the capital of the United States

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.690
to the Library of Congress.

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:33.150
And every time I do, I
marvel at the thinking

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.490 position:56%
of our framers and Thomas Jefferson.

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.040
Imagine that he said, the Congress

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.720
of the United States
should have its own library.

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.480
And today, this is
the largest repository

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.200
of knowledge in the entire world.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.400
And I think it's really fitting
for this meeting to be taking place

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:06.210
at the Library of Congress because
Assyrians have not only a culture

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:14.070
and a heritage that is rich,
but it dates back to the origins

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:19.160
of civilization and what they
as a people brought forward.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:26.800
So we are the descendants of
that heritage and that history.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.560
I want to thank Dr. Mary Jane
Deeb who's the Chief of African

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.480
and Middle Eastern, the division,
here at the Library of Congress.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.170
I don't see her but I want to
acknowledge her role in this,

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:46.440
and of course, for this
meeting to be open to the public

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.120
and Assyrian legacy from
ancient civilization

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.110
to modern cultural revival.

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.270
It's extra special, it's not
only special for me to be here

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:03.490
with you today but it's extra
special that my colleague

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:10.160
and brother friend Congressman
Frank Wolf is here with us today.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:15.680
He has been a giant in the
Congress for human rights.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:22.870
He has been a force to reckon with
regardless of the administration,

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:27.540
regardless of the politics
of anything.

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.250 position:56%
He has a voice that is, that really,

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:36.690
when he speaks his magnificent
voice echoes around the world,

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:40.970
and oppressed people
know the name Frank Wolf.

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:42.460
So Frank, thank you.

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.660
I miss you in the Congress
but I know

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:48.500
that your magnificent
work continues.

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:54.700
Let me just say a few words about
the work that Congressman Wolf

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:59.380
and I did together
relative to our people.

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:06.060
Back in 2008, we came together
and decided that there needed

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:10.120
to be a vehicle recognized
in the House.

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:17.160
And so we created a caucus that's
called the Religious Minorities

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.970
in the Middle East Caucus.

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:22.690
And we had at least
two goals in mind.

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:27.640
First of all, we knew that members
of Congress needed to be educated.

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:33.200
They knew very little or nothing,
and this is not fault or blame,

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:36.550
they just didn't know,
they didn't understand.

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:41.670
Some were even surprised, hold
on to your seats, or your hats,

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:44.080
that there were Christians
in the Middle East.

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.210
Imagine that.

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:48.210
And one of my favorite
responses was,

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:51.900
where do you think Jesus was
born, Trenton New Jersey?

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:58.730
So that was one of our
goals, but also to deepen

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:05.680
and broaden their appreciation
of the ancient cultures

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:11.620
in the Middle East and why they
deserve our support in the Congress

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:18.100
and the nexus between the values
of America that would drive us

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:21.230
to do that, that would
drive us to do that.

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:23.630
Clearly, there's a
nexus between them.

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:28.680
Now, we only had a few members to
begin with but we kept working.

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.850
I think two of the most
important accomplishments,

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:40.460 position:56%
and I want to acknowledge again,
Congressman Wolf's just fearlessness

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:50.010 position:56%
and insistence that we would secure
$10 million in 2010 to fund programs

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:53.210
that would protect Iraq's
religious minorities,

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:56.160 position:56%
and secondly, we passed legislation.

00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:01.370 position:56%
And it really was at his
insistence to create a special envoy

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:04.110
for religious minorities
in the Middle East.

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:06.590
I remember Frank saying
to me, "Anna,

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:13.380
if there is not a point
person that is a high level,

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:17.900
then we're just going to drift
from one person to another

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:20.860
within the State Department."

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:23.020
How right he was about that.

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:24.930
So I think that we've
come a long way.

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:29.770
The caucus is grown now to
over fifty active members

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:35.950
and we've advanced, I think, very
recently an historic achievement.

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:39.360
On March 14th of this year,
the United States House

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:45.770
of Representatives
voted 393 to zero.

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:47.090
So it was unanimous.

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:53.160
Every member that was on the floor
to vote voted for the resolution

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:58.500
that Congressman Jeff Fortenberry
and myself were the sponsors of.

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:05.280 position:56%
He is now, he has taken Frank's
place as the Co-Chair of the caucus.

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:07.480
Now, why is this historic?

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:12.310
This is only the second time in
the history of the United States

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:19.940
of America that as a genocide is
taking place, that we would place

00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:23.750
that definition on
what is occurring.

00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:26.820
The other was Rwanda.

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:34.510
And it defines the persecution of
Christians, obviously Assyrians

00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:40.790 position:56%
because we are Christian, Chaldeans,
Syriacs, Yazidis and other ethnic

00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:44.830
and religious minorities
in Iraq and Syria.

00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:47.800
Three days later, imagine
this Frank,

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:54.860
the State Department I think took a
historic step as well by asserting

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:59.530
that the persecution
of Christians, Yazidis

00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:04.720
and by Isis is in fact a genocide.

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:07.960
In a powerful, and I think
really poignant speech,

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:11.420
the Secretary of State
stated "the fact

00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:13.750
that dioecious [assumed
spelling] kills Christians

00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:18.770 position:56%
because they are Christians,
Yazidis because they are as Yazidis,

00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:21.280
Shia because they are Shia.

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:26.650
In its entire worldview, it's
based on eliminating those

00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:31.980
who do not subscribe to
its perverse ideology.

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:36.040
There is no question in my
mind that if dioecius succeeded

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:39.020
in establishing its
so-called caliphate,

00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:43.440
it would seek to destroy
what remains of ethnic

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:48.740
and the religious mosaic which
once thrived in the region."

00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:52.800
And as I said, it's only the
second time in the history

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:58.610
of the United States of America
that such a designation has been,

00:09:58.610 --> 00:10:00.240
the designation has been placed.

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:07.260
But we still have an
enormous amount of work to do.

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:13.690
Today, June 10th marks the second
anniversary of the invasion

00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:18.850
of Mosul, when half a million
people fled for their lives.

00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:24.460
Some didn't make it, and we
know what happened to them.

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:28.930
Overnight, we saw the
systematic extermination

00:10:28.930 --> 00:10:32.940
of the world's oldest
Christian communities by Isis,

00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:35.440 position:56%
and of course, they haven't stopped.

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:37.630
They continue to ravage Iraq

00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:41.200
and Syria's religious
and ethnic minorities.

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:43.010
Men and boys are being killed,

00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:47.650
women and girls are being
abducted, sold, raped.

00:10:47.650 --> 00:10:51.130
So a genocide designation

00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:56.940 position:56%
by the United States is an important
step, but it's only one step.

00:10:56.940 --> 00:11:01.580
I work daily with my colleagues
both in the caucus and from

00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:06.640 position:56%
across the House of Representatives.

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:10.050
This is a nonpartisan issue.

00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:12.950
This is not Republican, Democrat.

00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:15.890
We never treated it that way.

00:11:15.890 --> 00:11:20.340
It should not be treated that
way because we need to attract

00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:22.850
as much support as we can.

00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:30.860 position:56%
We're working on a daily basis to
continue to secure humanitarian aid.

00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:37.890
We work to bring about security
and an expedited pathway

00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:43.390
to refugee status for the besieged
ethnic and religious minorities

00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:48.380
in Iraq and Syria who are
just suffering so immensely

00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:57.110
that there are not adjectives I
think that fit the word suffering.

00:11:57.110 --> 00:12:01.280
We also continue to
assist USAID partners

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:06.170
in reaching the displaced
populations, and Assyrians are

00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:12.760
so much a part of that, that reside
outside of the refugee camps.

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:17.130
And we know very especially
that, that is,

00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:26.290
that that describes the Assyrians
and a majority obviously of those

00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:30.870
that are afraid to be in
the camps mixed with others

00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:34.640
because of a long and
troubled history.

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:41.320
We're also working very hard
to see that as the areas

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:46.480
that are liberated, that the
Kurdish regional government

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:53.140
and the Iraqi government not
only honor the return for those

00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:59.010
that were forced to flee, but
also to have a safe haven,

00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:03.630
also to have a safe
haven because, well,

00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:06.120
for all of the reasons
that you already know.

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:10.720
In so many ways, I'm
preaching to the choir here

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:12.050
because you are the scholars

00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:15.760
and the knowledge-base
of all of these issues.

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:22.400
So I want to thank you for
inviting me to be here today.

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:29.490
I'm very proud that our history
is being placed front and center

00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:34.350
at an institution that is
the greatest repository

00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:38.000
of information in the world.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.750
This is the appropriate
place for not only my people,

00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:48.100
but for those that have come to
learn about our culture to be.

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:51.470
And I want to thank
you for the recognition

00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:58.010
from the Assyrian Alliance,

00:13:58.010 --> 00:14:02.270
the Assyrian Universal
Alliance, America.

00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:07.620
And I also want to end on this
note of once again paying tribute

00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:13.240
to my magnificent colleague, a man
of such great integrity, of faith,

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:15.740
of a voice that has such clarity,

00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:19.170
and it comes from such
a deep place in him.

00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:24.130
When members of Congress leave
the Congress, most are interested

00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:28.220
in going off and making a lot
of money because when you're

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:31.860
in public service you don't go
into public service for money.

00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:34.370
That's not what it's about.

00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:42.290
But he has a continuum of his work
of what he did in the Congress

00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:44.280
and what he is doing now.

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:47.970
So Frank, bless you, bless you.

00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:50.990
I know God has blessed you
with your magnificent family

00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:55.010
and sixteen grandchildren
that he was talking about.

00:14:55.010 --> 00:15:01.050 position:56%
So with that, I'm going to, I wish
I could stay longer but it's Friday,

00:15:01.050 --> 00:15:03.260
I have to get out to Dulles.

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:06.940
The lines are excruciatingly long.

00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:11.650
It's not a good day to travel but I
need to get back to my constituents

00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:13.730
in California and I don't
want to miss the flight.

00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:18.550
So, thank you, God bless all of you
and thank you to the organizations

00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:22.390
and everyone that's here today,
including the Library of Congress.

00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:24.080
Thank you.

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:25.880
Thank you.

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:40.010

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:46.740
&gt;&gt; Congresswoman Anna
Eshoo, ladies and gentlemen.

00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:50.540
I'd like to take this opportunity
now to introduce Congressman Wolf.

00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:54.730
Congressman Wolf, throughout his
career in Congress was an advocate

00:15:54.730 --> 00:15:59.080
of human rights, and that did not
stop once he retired from Congress.

00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:03.030
In fact Congressman Wolf went
to Iraq, if I'm not mistaken,

00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:05.670
after he had retired from Congress

00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:09.350 position:56%
to go see firsthand what was
happening to the Assyrian community.

00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:13.810
So I'd like to again ask Mr. Carlo
Gunja to join me on the stage,

00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:18.960
and I would like to ask
Congressman Wolf on the stage.

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:22.870
We have a appreciation plaque for
you as well for all the service

00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:27.060
that you've done, not just for our
community but for all communities

00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:28.450
that are facing persecution.

00:16:28.450 --> 00:16:30.250
Thank you again, Congressman.

00:16:30.250 --> 00:16:38.870
[ Applause ]

00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:40.170
&gt;&gt; Frank Wolf: Thank you very much,

00:16:40.170 --> 00:16:42.820
they want us to get
together, there you go.

00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:50.640
Great. Well, thank you very much.

00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:53.260
And it was good to see Anna.

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:56.650
You know, I don't see
her as much as I used to,

00:16:56.650 --> 00:16:58.290
and she's one of my favorite people

00:16:58.290 --> 00:17:02.110
so it was a treasure just
to be here to see her.

00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:06.920
I think Anna said a lot of
things that I was going to say.

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:10.540
So I'm going to try to take
it from really what Anna said

00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:15.450
to some ideas and some thoughts.

00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:20.970 position:56%
I want to begin my saying, you know,
the Bible says much about this,

00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:22.680
and Jesus says much about this.

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:26.930
In Ecclesiastes 4, it said "again I
looked and I saw all the oppression

00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:29.210 position:56%
that was taking place under the sun.

00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:32.260
I saw the tears of the oppressed
and they have no comfort.

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:34.170
The power was on the
side of the oppressors."

00:17:34.170 --> 00:17:37.740
And Jesus in Luke 4 talks
about the oppressed.

00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:39.450
The situations out in the region,

00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:43.660
Paul would have a very difficult
time traveling to Damascus

00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:48.110
to Straight Street, now the only
Street mentioned in the Bible.

00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:52.600
And in Iraq we all know, and many
of you know as much as anything,

00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:55.420 position:56%
so I'm not going to get into detail.

00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:57.180
I remember my first trip to Iraq.

00:17:57.180 --> 00:17:59.990
We were in Nasiriyah
when the war broke out,

00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:01.680
and the administration
wouldn't let me go.

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:05.980
We kind of came in from Kuwait,
and we were in this little town.

00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:09.590
I showed my ID to the soldier and
I said I'm a member of Congress

00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:12.690
and he said, oh, come on in,
do you know where we are?

00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:14.630
I said it's Nasiriyah on my map.

00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:15.950
He said, no, this is Ur.

00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:17.880
And he took me took
me to a ziggurat,

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:22.600 position:56%
many of you may have been there,
and I climbed the ziggurat, 2200 BC.

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:24.730
And there's a history.

00:18:24.730 --> 00:18:29.260
Abraham, Ezekiel's buried
there, Daniel's buried there.

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:32.720
When we were there last
year we were in Alqush,

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:36.270
up almost in the front
lines where the Isis is.

00:18:36.270 --> 00:18:38.200
And we're in this little
village again,

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:41.940
and they kept saying they want to
went to see the tomb, the tomb.

00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:44.060
And I said, sure, and they took me

00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:46.480
to Nahum's tomb, Nahum's
buried there.

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:47.780
I touched Nahum's tomb.

00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:52.880
The history in this region, in
your region is unbelievable.

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:56.830
It's one that should wake up the
church in the West, and I think one

00:18:56.830 --> 00:18:59.790
of the important things
we need to do is wake

00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:01.340
up the church in the West.

00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:04.050
I'm going to skip a lot
of what I was going to say

00:19:04.050 --> 00:19:06.640
but just tell you one story.

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:09.530
When we were there we
were in a little village

00:19:09.530 --> 00:19:11.920
and they took us in
to see a refugee.

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:16.770
It was old school, and it was a man
who had been a construction worker.

00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:18.930
You could feel his hands,
they were very, very rough.

00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:20.230
He had two children.

00:19:20.230 --> 00:19:22.800
And he told us a story.

00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:26.510
He said when Isis came in he lived
a few miles outside of Mosul.

00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:28.340
Isil came in and took
over his village.

00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:30.890
He had a wife four
kids at that time.

00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:33.730
One daughter has since
left to go to Turkey

00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:37.590
and is his son now
living in San Diego.

00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:42.230
He said his wife had
cancer, breast cancer.

00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:44.360
A lot of cancer runs in my family.

00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:49.040
So he said a few days after Isis
took over, he and his wife went

00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:52.660
to the hospital for his
wife to get treated.

00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:57.610 position:56%
He said the Isis said they would not
give her treatment unless you were

00:19:57.610 --> 00:20:01.140
to convert, unless she
were to renounce her faith,

00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:03.800
unless she were to deny Jesus.

00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:07.920
He said, they refused, his
wife refused and he refused.

00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:12.660 position:56%
They went back to the little village
and she died several weeks later.

00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:18.920
I could not help thinking of that
story, because last November I was

00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:24.210
in Israel and we went
up to Capernaum.

00:20:24.210 --> 00:20:27.190
And in Capernaum we went into
this little church which is

00:20:27.190 --> 00:20:30.840
above the house, Peter's
house, and we went to the site

00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:32.970
where Peter walked on the water,

00:20:32.970 --> 00:20:39.760
were sites where Peter
gave the Beatitudes.

00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:46.330
And I kind of thought, here's
Peter, who ate with Jesus,

00:20:46.330 --> 00:20:53.550
who saw Jesus do miracles, who
saw Jesus walk on the water,

00:20:53.550 --> 00:20:58.410
and Peter denied Jesus three times.

00:20:58.410 --> 00:21:04.020
An Iraqi-Assyrian Christian
construction worker

00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:09.060
who never saw Jesus and his
wife refused to deny Christ.

00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:12.590
And so the thought that
these people are there and we

00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:15.250
in the West are forgetting
about them.

00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:18.310
And so there are some things
that I think that you could do

00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:21.230
and I'm going to kind of move,
move to really because I don't want

00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:24.540
to leave you on a down note
except to tell you though just

00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:29.020
so I can electrify and
alert you on something.

00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:32.820
The Bill that Anna was so gracious
to mention was special envoy

00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:37.710
which she played a major part in to
set up a special envoy to advocate

00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:40.400
for the persecuted church in Iraq,

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:43.170
but also in Syria,
in the Middle East.

00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:46.880
Knox Stan said the
following the other day.

00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:52.440
He was in Rome but says a US
governmental official visiting Rome

00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:58.210
on Monday said that as a result
of the Islamic terrorist groups

00:21:58.210 --> 00:22:04.900
such as Isis, the door for
Christians in Iraq is closing

00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:11.260
and the window of time to prevent
their eradication is narrowing.

00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:14.850
And Knox said, I feel
a sense of urgency.

00:22:14.850 --> 00:22:17.210
These Christians are leaving.

00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:21.510
There were one and a half
million Christians in Iraq

00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:26.840
when the war began, and I
think if I don't get it.

00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:28.830
There were one and a
half million Christians

00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:32.170
in Iraq before the war began.

00:22:32.170 --> 00:22:36.010
Now when we were there, we
were told it's roughly 250,000.

00:22:36.010 --> 00:22:37.310
Bishop Welder [assumed
spelling] said

00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:41.490
that roughly seventeen Christian
families leave every day.

00:22:41.490 --> 00:22:45.100
And the thought that we
would have the Middle East,

00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:49.970 position:56%
the cradle of Christendom, many of
your relatives and relatives of far,

00:22:49.970 --> 00:22:53.720 position:56%
far distance in the past, people
who speak Aramaic, the same language

00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:57.750
as Jesus, the thought that they
would be eradicated and removed

00:22:57.750 --> 00:23:00.220
from that region is painful.

00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:04.400
So what can be done?

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:06.380
What should be done?

00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:09.610
And these are again, my
own personal opinions.

00:23:09.610 --> 00:23:12.400
So again, I think it's
great that we pass this,

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:14.680
Anna said to call it genocide.

00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:17.180
My thing is, next step is what.

00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:19.630
We were able to convince
that the language,

00:23:19.630 --> 00:23:23.750
if you look at the CJS bill that
Congressman Culberson has language

00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:26.880
in order to prosecute Isis people,

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:29.010
they're going to look
anyone who's joined Isis

00:23:29.010 --> 00:23:30.760
to begin the prosecution.

00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:32.490
So we're having a group

00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:35.850
at the Justice Department
to deal with that issue.

00:23:35.850 --> 00:23:38.820
Secondly, I urge you to
urge members of Congress

00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:41.070
to go to the region and visit.

00:23:41.070 --> 00:23:44.300
When I was in Congress we
would go out, we would see,

00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:47.180
we would live in the camps,
we would be with the people.

00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:51.630
You can't know about Iraq unless
you see it and feel it and touch it

00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:54.890
and taste it, and not just
get in there at 10 o'clock

00:23:54.890 --> 00:23:57.010
in the morning and
leave before dark.

00:23:57.010 --> 00:24:00.260
But spend the night,
listen to the people.

00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:03.320
So I urge you to urge
members of Congress to go.

00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:08.380
Secondly, I urge you always
keep this as a bipartisan issue.

00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:11.940
But I urge you to join the Coptic
Christians who I was with yesterday

00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:15.990
and the other groups to
meet with Secretary Clinton,

00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:19.430
the Democratic nominee and Donald
Trump, the Republican nominee

00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:21.470
and do it before the election.

00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:25.740
Do it even before Labor Day if
you can, to sit in and ask them

00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:34.070
to make this, to make this
a priority, to speak on it.

00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:35.840
The presidency and people running

00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:39.860
for the presidency have great
credibility and when they speak,

00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:41.330
they have a round microphone.

00:24:41.330 --> 00:24:44.920
You should ask Donald Trump
and Secretary Clinton to speak

00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:49.290
out on this issue, but they should
be, you should meet with them.

00:24:49.290 --> 00:24:52.770
Thirdly, I urge and ask
both political parties.

00:24:52.770 --> 00:24:55.790
I'm trying to get it done in my
party, but both political parties,

00:24:55.790 --> 00:24:59.850
to carry language on this
issue in their platforms

00:24:59.850 --> 00:25:03.790
so that the American people and
other members of Congress can see

00:25:03.790 --> 00:25:07.550
that this is such an
important issue.

00:25:07.550 --> 00:25:10.960
Next, get new members
in January and February,

00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:14.660
new members of Congress
to become advocates.

00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:17.840
Before I got elected to Congress
I didn't know anything about this.

00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:20.610
I took a trip to Romania
during the dark days

00:25:20.610 --> 00:25:23.840
of the Ceausescu administration
and literally became electrified

00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:26.080
by seeing the persecution.

00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:29.650
Try to adopt some new
members of Congress

00:25:29.650 --> 00:25:34.180
to come and join and come along.

00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:39.990
And lastly, you need
to wake up the church.

00:25:39.990 --> 00:25:45.790
The Pope has spoken
out on this issue.

00:25:45.790 --> 00:25:49.160
Cardinal Dolan has
spoken out on this issue.

00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:52.290
Cardinal Whorl has
spoken out on this issue.

00:25:52.290 --> 00:25:55.310
Russell Moore has spoken
out on this issue.

00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:58.900
But few other members have, and
here we have an issue that impacts

00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:02.280
on the faith community and
go back to look at words

00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:06.320
in the Old Testament and the
New Testament, look at passages

00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:09.780
in Proverbs, look at the very
fact, this ought to be an issue

00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:12.010
that the church cares deeply about.

00:26:12.010 --> 00:26:15.750
And so the silence of the
church, if you may remember,

00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:20.570
Dietrich Bonhoeffer spoke out
against anti-Nazi activity.

00:26:20.570 --> 00:26:23.430
We should electrify
and wake up the church.

00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:25.920
Now in fairness to the
church in the West,

00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:30.350
it may be because they do not
know completely what is going on.

00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:33.300
But I urge you to wake
up the church,

00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:37.850
and if we do these things I
think we can, I believe honestly,

00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:40.830
we can turn this issue around.

00:26:40.830 --> 00:26:43.140
But time is short.

00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:46.100
And for the political process,
the way to get the attention

00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:49.610
of people running for office is
talk to them before the election

00:26:49.610 --> 00:26:51.320
and then after the election.

00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:55.770
So talk to your members, meet
with Trump, meet with Clinton,

00:26:55.770 --> 00:27:00.130
get it in the platform, get new
members of Congress to comment

00:27:00.130 --> 00:27:02.470
and lastly, wake up the church.

00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:06.040
And lastly, pray that God will
move this nation to deal with this.

00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:10.970
I do not want to see on our
watch, particularly those of us

00:27:10.970 --> 00:27:15.460
who are blessed to still be here in
five years from now, where we see,

00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:19.120
that we will see literally
the end of Christianity

00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:21.000
in the cradle of Christendom.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.410
Again, thank you very
much for the opportunity.

00:27:23.410 --> 00:27:29.290
[ Applause ]

00:27:29.290 --> 00:27:33.440
&gt;&gt; Thank you for joining us
for our last panel for the day.

00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:37.170
Assyrian Culture in the
Middle East and Diaspora.

00:27:37.170 --> 00:27:43.120
Our first speaker Fadi
Davood, is a research analyst,

00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:46.650
NATO Association of Canada.

00:27:46.650 --> 00:27:48.850
He is a historian of
the modern Middle East

00:27:48.850 --> 00:27:52.110
with special focus on
minority populations.

00:27:52.110 --> 00:27:54.470
He has taught in a
number of universities

00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:56.120
in Canada and the United Kingdom.

00:27:56.120 --> 00:28:00.600
His PhD is from the School of
Oriental and African Studies,

00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:04.740
University of London, was on
refugees, warriors and minorities

00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:09.500
in Iraq, the case of the
Assyrians 1920 to 1933.

00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:11.220
He is the, he is co-editor

00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:16.730
of a forthcoming edited edition
entitled State and Society in Iraq,

00:28:16.730 --> 00:28:22.420
Citizenship under Occupation,
Dictatorship and Democratization.

00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:28.610
So, Mr Fadi Davood.

00:28:28.610 --> 00:28:29.910
&gt;&gt; Fadi Davood: Thank you.

00:28:29.910 --> 00:28:32.490
One second.

00:28:32.490 --> 00:28:34.830
Here we go.

00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:40.190
Good afternoon everyone, and thank
you for an invitation, Dr. Naby

00:28:40.190 --> 00:28:43.080
and everyone for organizing.

00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:48.380
This is actually a paper that
I'm beginning to think about now

00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:52.540
on nationalism, nationalisms I
should say, not only nationalism

00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:57.850
in the Middle East, and about the
various nationalist ideologies

00:28:57.850 --> 00:29:00.860
that emerged in the period
of the late Ottoman empire

00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:03.400
into the formations
of the modern state.

00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:07.410
So I am in essence contextualizing
the Assyrians, their nationalists,

00:29:07.410 --> 00:29:10.640
the Kurdish nationalists and other
nationalists sort of policies

00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:14.490
into the larger context
of political movements

00:29:14.490 --> 00:29:16.140
that emerged in the period.

00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:20.210
And I'm essentially
arguing that nationalisms

00:29:20.210 --> 00:29:23.890
in the Middle East were contrary
to what literature says to us,

00:29:23.890 --> 00:29:26.210
were not movements
for secularization,

00:29:26.210 --> 00:29:27.700
rather they were always rooted

00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:31.780
in ethno-religious nationalist
ideologies and they were combating.

00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:37.540
The only reason that they
emerged were urban nationals

00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:43.050
and urban elites were
combating religious politicians

00:29:43.050 --> 00:29:46.810
and religious clergy for dominance
in the region or dominance

00:29:46.810 --> 00:29:48.110
of the political sphere
in the region.

00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:53.980
In ant case, and without
going too much,

00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:56.800 position:56%
I will say that the Syrian
nationalism emerged in the same time

00:29:56.800 --> 00:30:01.510
and under similar circumstances
as Arab, Kurdish,

00:30:01.510 --> 00:30:03.970
Turkish nationalism amongst many

00:30:03.970 --> 00:30:08.980 position:56%
in the late Ottoman period following
the Ottoman Tanzimat reforms.

00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:13.150
Educated urban elites were the ones
originally responsible for thinking

00:30:13.150 --> 00:30:17.300 position:56%
about areas of ethnic and linguistic
nationalism, and the same group

00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:21.260 position:56%
of people were also responsible for
other political and social movements

00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:22.560
that accompanied the rise

00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:25.320
of nationalistic thought
in the Middle East.

00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:29.700 position:56%
Originally founded in greater Syria,
ideas of nationalism were theorized

00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:32.100
by intellectuals in
Damascus and Beirut.

00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:35.710
Both Muslim and Christian
intellectuals hoped

00:30:35.710 --> 00:30:38.530
that for example pan- Arab
nationalism would unite members

00:30:38.530 --> 00:30:41.470
of the community against
the central Ottoman state

00:30:41.470 --> 00:30:44.970
and created a united
opposition to policies

00:30:44.970 --> 00:30:50.000
that they feared would infringe
upon their place in urban life.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.300 position:56%
Emerging Arab nationals for example,
were not united in the root cause

00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:56.020
and adopting the adopting the
idea for example in Beirut,

00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:57.870
Christian urban notables
feared the pan-

00:30:57.870 --> 00:31:00.550
Islamist policies of
the Ottoman state.

00:31:00.550 --> 00:31:03.640
Muslim-educated intellectuals
in Beirut were concerned

00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:07.780
about the censorship policies
of SP constitutionalism promoted

00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:10.340
by the Ottoman sultan at the time..

00:31:10.340 --> 00:31:14.570 position:56%
Meanwhile urban notables in Damascus
feared for the increasing influence

00:31:14.570 --> 00:31:22.230
of European interests and as a
form of controlling the populace.

00:31:22.230 --> 00:31:25.380
The political conditions that
influence and gave way to the rise

00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:27.480
of Arab nationals and
were also present in areas

00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:31.740
of the Ottoman Empire were large
Assyrian populations lived.

00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:34.910
Urban Assyrians and in particular
those living in greater Syria,

00:31:34.910 --> 00:31:37.710
Torabdeen, and Otomin
in Iran were influenced

00:31:37.710 --> 00:31:40.970
by the political movements
emerging in the region

00:31:40.970 --> 00:31:44.010
where early Assyrian nationalists
saw the marginalization

00:31:44.010 --> 00:31:46.650
of the community both in the
political and social spheres

00:31:46.650 --> 00:31:50.800 position:56%
of the Ottoman Empire as a reason
to protect an identity that they saw

00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:53.620
as an integral to their
language, religion

00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:58.530
and unique cultural identity
in the larger Ottoman milieu.

00:31:58.530 --> 00:32:02.630
As a result, members of the
Assyrian community began to think

00:32:02.630 --> 00:32:05.630
of as a collective on how they
could preserve their identity

00:32:05.630 --> 00:32:09.430
within the shifting
unsettled, political conditions

00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:11.990
in the hinterland of the empire.

00:32:11.990 --> 00:32:16.040
They published books,
magazines, newspapers and articles

00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:18.410 position:56%
that discussed the history, identity

00:32:18.410 --> 00:32:21.320
and most importantly the
national ethnic origin

00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:22.960
of the Assyrian people.

00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:26.170
For example in 1879,
Assyrians of Diyarbakir

00:32:26.170 --> 00:32:29.400
in what is now southern Turkey
established the ancient city Oyo

00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:34.840
brotherhood as well as establishing
grammar schools, literary societies

00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:38.150
and other organizations that helped
to promote and educate Assyrians

00:32:38.150 --> 00:32:44.490
and their shared identity,
history and nationalist vision.

00:32:44.490 --> 00:32:50.170
Now from this context, I argue
that three sort of groups

00:32:50.170 --> 00:32:54.720
of people emerged fighting for
leadership in the case of Iraq.

00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:58.850
Just these early nationalist
people like Naum Faiq

00:32:58.850 --> 00:33:03.190
and Freydun Atturaya were those
individuals that actually started

00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:06.100
to theorize and for the most part
they were urban intellectuals

00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:10.960
who actually had no
background in tribal politics

00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:13.610
that actually plagued
Assyrians of the time.

00:33:13.610 --> 00:33:19.810
Now in 1915, the sort of
the period between the rise

00:33:19.810 --> 00:33:23.080
of this nationalist
ideology and the genocide

00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:26.600
that befell the Syrian population
which I don't really have much time

00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:30.570
to get into at the moment, but
I talked about it elsewhere,

00:33:30.570 --> 00:33:35.070
minority Christian populations
were targeted Armenians, Assyrians,

00:33:35.070 --> 00:33:41.110
Pontiac Greeks by Kurdish
regulars and Ottomans alike

00:33:41.110 --> 00:33:44.440
where it is hypothesized
that about 50 percent

00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:50.000
of the population was massacred
which resulted in mass displacement

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.760
of the population where
they were actually brought

00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:55.690
to what is called the Buqaba
refugee camp which I actually talk

00:33:55.690 --> 00:33:58.950
about again in the
forthcoming collection.

00:33:58.950 --> 00:34:02.880
So I encourage everyone
to buy a copy,

00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:05.990
where these people were brought
and I argue that this piece

00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:09.750
that they created in the refugee
camp gave rise to three types

00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:13.390
of leaders urban intellectuals,
military generals

00:34:13.390 --> 00:34:18.920
and military warriors and the
third group are religious figures.

00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:21.730
And so this is a picture
of the refugee camp

00:34:21.730 --> 00:34:25.550
for those that haven't seen it.

00:34:25.550 --> 00:34:30.520
So speaking of the case in
Iraq so fast forward a bit.

00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:33.690
After the genocide, they were
brought to the Baquba refugee camp

00:34:33.690 --> 00:34:41.160
and here we have a new sort of call
for the rise of Syrian nationalism.

00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:43.890
So the death of Barsha Mudi
[phonetic spelling] in 1920

00:34:43.890 --> 00:34:47.800
who was the figurehead of the
church of the East and settlement

00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:51.190
of this community in Baquba
brought various tribal groups

00:34:51.190 --> 00:34:52.680
into one space.

00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:55.960
The refugee camp provided a way
for political ideas to be exchanged

00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:58.710
between members of the
community without the obstacles

00:34:58.710 --> 00:35:00.690
of geographic separation.

00:35:00.690 --> 00:35:02.620
As a result, new ideas promoted

00:35:02.620 --> 00:35:06.460 position:56%
by various political figures allowed
members of the refugee population

00:35:06.460 --> 00:35:09.720
to become engaged in debates that
continue to occupy the community

00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:13.530
and particularly the urban
elites or the urban intellectuals

00:35:13.530 --> 00:35:15.750
of those communities
for the remainder

00:35:15.750 --> 00:35:17.150
of the British mandates in Iraq.

00:35:17.150 --> 00:35:20.050
Just a side note, the British
mandates in Iraq was the period

00:35:20.050 --> 00:35:25.070
of colonial occupation that began
in 1920, turned into a mandate

00:35:25.070 --> 00:35:30.420
under the auspices of the League
of Nations in 1922, ending in 1932.

00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:33.570
As a result of these
new ideas promoted

00:35:33.570 --> 00:35:37.030
by the various political figures
allowed members of the population

00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:42.280
to engage in debates about
nationalism, identity and politics.

00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:45.990
After the death of Mar Shimun,
Sumo Mar Shimun who is the sister

00:35:45.990 --> 00:35:48.130
of the performing Mar
Shimun and the aunt

00:35:48.130 --> 00:35:50.590
of the new Mar Shimun was
10 years old or 11 years old

00:35:50.590 --> 00:35:54.540
when he became religious leader
became politically responsible

00:35:54.540 --> 00:35:57.230
or she thought that she had
become politically-responsible

00:35:57.230 --> 00:35:59.610
for the leadership of
the Syrian community.

00:35:59.610 --> 00:36:02.420
She took it upon herself to promote
the interests of the population

00:36:02.420 --> 00:36:05.030
to the British colonial
government in Iraq with the aid

00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:08.550
of Anglican missionaries while
individuals like Agha Petros

00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:14.480
who I have picture of I think, Sama
Shimun and this is Agha Petros.

00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:18.970
Agha Petros, Yusif Malik and others
were some of the political figures

00:36:18.970 --> 00:36:21.940
who challenged the political
role of the Mar Shimun family

00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:25.510
and the religious leadership
at the time.

00:36:25.510 --> 00:36:30.190
The Assyrians were not politically
unified so we have to say

00:36:30.190 --> 00:36:33.220 position:56%
that when we talk about nationalism,
we're not talking a unified group

00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:36.140
of people that understood
what this nationalism meant.

00:36:36.140 --> 00:36:39.540
Nationalism meant different things
for different individuals depending

00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:43.530
on where they had emerged.

00:36:43.530 --> 00:36:45.820 position:56%
The Assyrians were not
politically unified during the years

00:36:45.820 --> 00:36:47.710
of the British mandate,
some prominent figures

00:36:47.710 --> 00:36:51.870
within the community, most
prominently Yusif Malik called

00:36:51.870 --> 00:36:54.770
for the settlement of the
Assyrians outside of the borders

00:36:54.770 --> 00:36:57.740
of the Iraqi state,
but Malik also argued

00:36:57.740 --> 00:37:00.060
that if the British were not
going to fulfill their promise

00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:03.180
to the community by establishing
independent nation state

00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:06.740
for the population, he called for
the settlement of the community

00:37:06.740 --> 00:37:08.960
in Iraq, and for the
recognition of the political

00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:11.380
and religious leadership as part

00:37:11.380 --> 00:37:15.150
of the political fabric
of the Iraqi state.

00:37:15.150 --> 00:37:16.450
In essence, Malik argued

00:37:16.450 --> 00:37:19.460
that Assyrian religious
officeholders must be recognized

00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:23.810
as part of the organic Law scheme
of 1925 in Iraq and he called

00:37:23.810 --> 00:37:25.790
for the appointment of
nonreligious hearings

00:37:25.790 --> 00:37:28.650
to the national government
in Baghdad.

00:37:28.650 --> 00:37:30.790
Malik believed that this
would encourage members

00:37:30.790 --> 00:37:33.820
of the refugee population to
become more supportive to the ideas

00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:37.600
of settling in Iraq, and felt that
these representatives would be able

00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:40.840
to protect the community from
this hostile or what he saw

00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:43.760
as the hostile Arab
officials in Baghdad.

00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:47.490
Malik was the only member
of the Assyrian community

00:37:47.490 --> 00:37:49.800
to voice his support for
inclusion of the refugees

00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:52.590
in the administrative
structures of the state.

00:37:52.590 --> 00:37:55.780
As an Iraqi-born civil servant,
he had worked with the British

00:37:55.780 --> 00:37:59.810
and Iraqi governments for the vast
majority of the British mandate,

00:37:59.810 --> 00:38:02.770
and he argued that the inclusion
of members of the community

00:38:02.770 --> 00:38:04.130
in administrative structures

00:38:04.130 --> 00:38:07.820
of state would compel the Iraqi
government to accept the population

00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:13.550
within the political and social
apparatuses of the state.

00:38:13.550 --> 00:38:17.240
Interestingly, he was born in Iraq,
fluent in both Arabic and English.

00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:19.340
Malik was uniquely
positioned to speak on behalf

00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:21.280
of the Assyrian community.

00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:24.990
He emerged as part of this urban
leadership that I discussed earlier

00:38:24.990 --> 00:38:29.790
who had traditionally would have
had no participation or no role

00:38:29.790 --> 00:38:32.190
in the internal politics
of the community.

00:38:32.190 --> 00:38:34.940
Prior to the settlement of the
refugees in Iraq, religious

00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:38.050 position:56%
and tribal leaders were the only
officeholders of political authority

00:38:38.050 --> 00:38:42.810
in the HI Kari Mountains, and
Malik represented a new type

00:38:42.810 --> 00:38:46.230
of urban educated nontribal elite.

00:38:46.230 --> 00:38:50.360
He became part of the powerful
network of urban Assyrians in Iraq,

00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:54.360 position:56%
Syria, the United States and
elsewhere in the Diaspora and worked

00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:56.420
to demonstrate that the
community was not only able

00:38:56.420 --> 00:38:59.170
to manage its affairs without the
help or the need of involvement

00:38:59.170 --> 00:39:03.420
of tribal leaders, but saw
tribal authority as outdated,

00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:07.160
unable to manage the problems that
had faced the population in Iraq

00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:11.530
which created a camp of these
individuals separate from the rest

00:39:11.530 --> 00:39:15.260
of the leadership in the community.

00:39:15.260 --> 00:39:21.660
Now at the same time, you
know, perhaps one of one

00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:25.950
of the biggest sort of achievements
that we see in this period happen

00:39:25.950 --> 00:39:30.990 position:56%
within this urban elite community
is not only the publication of books

00:39:30.990 --> 00:39:35.480
and the probably promotion of
these ideas, but I think this sort

00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:40.670 position:56%
of the efforts that they made in
order to bring together a hodgepodge

00:39:40.670 --> 00:39:44.670
of individuals from various
churches, and they actually spoke

00:39:44.670 --> 00:39:49.910
about this national identity
under the auspices of the church.

00:39:49.910 --> 00:39:52.360
Now they actually believed that
the churches would be able to unite

00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:55.310
under the authority of one
patriarch at some point in time.

00:39:55.310 --> 00:39:58.980
So to them, they saw these
this nationalist movement

00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:04.000
as a unification under an
Assyrian religious identity

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:05.530
and not necessarily a secular one

00:40:05.530 --> 00:40:08.290
that literature would
have us to believe.

00:40:10.110 --> 00:40:12.330
Military leaders also
played an important role

00:40:12.330 --> 00:40:14.690
in shaping the leadership
struggles in the period

00:40:14.690 --> 00:40:16.300
of the British mandate in Iraq.

00:40:16.300 --> 00:40:18.590
Individuals like Alik Butros
[phonetic spelling] who claimed

00:40:18.590 --> 00:40:22.500
that he had spent and I find
this an important anecdote,

00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:24.340
he spent 38,000 rupees.

00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:28.990 position:56%
Iraq had used rupees as its currency
as it was managed under the office

00:40:28.990 --> 00:40:31.820
of India, India office at the time.

00:40:31.820 --> 00:40:35.420
38,000 rupees during
the 1921 on behalf

00:40:35.420 --> 00:40:37.300
of the Syrian refugees in Iraq.

00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:40.680
Butros claimed that he was acting
in an official capacity, again,

00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:43.480
all these people claim that they
were acting in an official capacity

00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:47.330
as Democratic representatives
of the Assyrian people.

00:40:47.330 --> 00:40:50.340
On behalf of the Assyrian refugee
population in Iraq, Butros claimed

00:40:50.340 --> 00:40:55.530 position:56%
that he was acting in an official an
elected democrat's capacity in order

00:40:55.530 --> 00:40:58.500
to save the population from
the persistent threats posed

00:40:58.500 --> 00:41:01.400
by the Arab population in
Baquba, and that the British

00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:05.450
and Iraqi governments had given
him the authority to act on behalf

00:41:05.450 --> 00:41:08.560
of the refugees during
the few first months

00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:11.660
of the British occupation in Iraq.

00:41:11.660 --> 00:41:14.850
Butros's campaign in this
area continued until 1923

00:41:14.850 --> 00:41:20.010
to 1924 period while actually, he
died just about around that time

00:41:20.010 --> 00:41:25.180
but the organization that he had
built continued to act as sort

00:41:25.180 --> 00:41:28.170
of as a group of these
military leaders

00:41:28.170 --> 00:41:32.200
when he began a long correspondence
with Winston Churchill for example

00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:34.500
and other British officials
in London.

00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:38.030
The letters he sent sought the
help of British individuals

00:41:38.030 --> 00:41:41.160
for the reimbursement of costs
he had personally incurred

00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:44.320
in Iraq and France.

00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:48.860 position:56%
Though the British refused to
comply with these sort of challenges

00:41:48.860 --> 00:41:53.910
or this money, the
return of the money,

00:41:53.910 --> 00:41:57.570
Butros and his allies used these
claims and the correspondence

00:41:57.570 --> 00:41:59.170
with British government
to demonstrate

00:41:59.170 --> 00:42:02.880
to the refugee population that he
was not only leader responsible

00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:06.830
for his pursuing their interests in
Iraq, they actually tried to show

00:42:06.830 --> 00:42:10.150
that the money he had
spent personally, you know,

00:42:10.150 --> 00:42:12.350
and according to supporters
was intended

00:42:12.350 --> 00:42:15.520
to help the refugee
population reoccupy villages

00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:18.670
that they had lost few
number of years earlier

00:42:18.670 --> 00:42:21.080
in the HI Kari Mountains
during the genocide.

00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:26.120
Agha Butros continues to occupy a
very special place amongst the what

00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:30.850
I call the pantheon of
Assyrian military leaders during

00:42:30.850 --> 00:42:33.480
and after the first world war
and thus in the collective memory

00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:37.550
of the Syrian community both
in Iraq and in the diaspora

00:42:37.550 --> 00:42:39.970
in North America and Europe.

00:42:39.970 --> 00:42:44.070
For example, a famous
Assyrian singer

00:42:44.070 --> 00:42:47.530
and musician recorded an entire
album dedicated to the memory

00:42:47.530 --> 00:42:50.560
and heroic acts of Butros.

00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:53.150
The album recalls a time
of political opportunity

00:42:53.150 --> 00:42:55.060
for the Assyrian people
when Butros tried

00:42:55.060 --> 00:42:57.900
to bring the population together
under one political banner,

00:42:57.900 --> 00:43:02.000
but inflated egos and squabbling
within the community led

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:05.290
to the destruction Butros'
dream of salvaging what remained

00:43:05.290 --> 00:43:09.230
of the Assyrian community
after the First World War.

00:43:09.230 --> 00:43:13.700
In the same album which is
entitled "Lion Hunter" you know,

00:43:13.700 --> 00:43:16.660
in sort of reference to the ancient
historical past that we heard

00:43:16.660 --> 00:43:21.190 position:56%
about this morning, the singer links
the memory of Butros to the heroic,

00:43:21.190 --> 00:43:24.200
ancient Assyrian kings and leaders.

00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:27.800
The songs on the album highlight
what are believed to be actions

00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:31.020
of a hero who led the Assyrians
through the First World War

00:43:31.020 --> 00:43:35.030
and beyond which actually
cement this whole idea

00:43:35.030 --> 00:43:40.030
of the military leader within
the Assyrian community.

00:43:42.590 --> 00:43:45.450
Now the third individuals
or the third group

00:43:45.450 --> 00:43:49.120
of people are the religious
establishment

00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:55.300
and the religious establishment
led by Sidma Mar Shimun,

00:43:55.300 --> 00:43:58.710
the aunt of Mar Shimun who I think
is a very fascinating individual

00:43:58.710 --> 00:44:02.670
as a female of the time was
working with British missionaries

00:44:02.670 --> 00:44:07.310
and other individuals to
demonstrate that the Assyrians were

00:44:07.310 --> 00:44:16.440 position:56%
in fact not only the reliant on her
sort of family and on her religious,

00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:20.680
sort of followers but rather
they actually had always

00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:23.330
"traditionally" lived
under these hospices.

00:44:23.330 --> 00:44:25.230
And so in the Baquba refugee camp,

00:44:25.230 --> 00:44:29.960
she managed to assemble an area
called the Aristocratic area

00:44:29.960 --> 00:44:32.940
within the refugee camp
which I discussed elsewhere

00:44:32.940 --> 00:44:36.850
that she actually managed to bring
the bishops and tribal leaders

00:44:36.850 --> 00:44:41.640
under a tribal authority or tribal
committee to manage the affairs

00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:44.110
of the community inside
this refugee camp,

00:44:44.110 --> 00:44:48.300
which actually made it much
more difficult for individuals

00:44:48.300 --> 00:44:52.810
like Agha Butros, unlike
those who I discussed military

00:44:52.810 --> 00:44:56.280
and nonmilitary leads to
actually conduct her role

00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:59.890
in managing the population.

00:44:59.890 --> 00:45:04.220
The role played by Sedma and Agha
Butros during the mandates put the

00:45:04.220 --> 00:45:07.520
leaders of the community
and the community as a whole

00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:09.540
into two political camps.

00:45:09.540 --> 00:45:12.660
Some believe that the refugee
population would be best served

00:45:12.660 --> 00:45:14.060
if the religious establishment

00:45:14.060 --> 00:45:18.090 position:56%
and in particular the Mar Shimun
family was politically marginalized.

00:45:18.090 --> 00:45:22.840
As part of a new excuse me military
leadership, they were motivated

00:45:22.840 --> 00:45:26.510
by what they saw as the necessity
for new political structure headed

00:45:26.510 --> 00:45:32.250 position:56%
by military or nonmilitary elites
lobbying the British for a new state

00:45:32.250 --> 00:45:37.770 position:56%
that would governed by these elites
in a democratically-elected fashion.

00:45:37.770 --> 00:45:41.850
And the claims for leadership
within the group were well-received

00:45:41.850 --> 00:45:48.320
by some community members between
1922 and 1929 as Assyrians began

00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:52.460
to develop plans to rescue
the committee or the community

00:45:52.460 --> 00:45:56.600
from the threats posed by the
Iraqi and British governments.

00:45:56.600 --> 00:46:04.210 position:56%
Now I conclude that all these
debates were debates within the sort

00:46:04.210 --> 00:46:07.090
of the educated elites and
military elites of the community.

00:46:07.090 --> 00:46:09.040
The larger population
which was living

00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:12.430
as a refugee population
really did not care

00:46:12.430 --> 00:46:15.300
about the pro-nationalist
sort of squabblings.

00:46:15.300 --> 00:46:17.780
What they were really caring about
is where they would be settled,

00:46:17.780 --> 00:46:21.080
how they would live and
essentially, you know,

00:46:21.080 --> 00:46:25.940
you live beyond subsistence living,
regain some of their, you know,

00:46:25.940 --> 00:46:28.690
livelihoods which was
mainly based in farming

00:46:28.690 --> 00:46:32.790
and agriculture prior
to the First World War.

00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:37.400
Now I think that as a result of
all these nationalist movements

00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:38.700
and this is what I'm theorizing,

00:46:38.700 --> 00:46:42.900
we have strong military
leaders emerging to take role

00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:47.130
as the supreme leader, as
the Savior of the nation

00:46:47.130 --> 00:46:52.060
and the Assyrians were no different
from Arabs, Turks and others.

00:46:52.060 --> 00:46:58.360
And yet at the same time
the populace became sort

00:46:58.360 --> 00:47:01.840
of absorbed these ideas through
propaganda beating the case

00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:06.050 position:56%
of Arab nationalism in Iraq or Syria
or Turkish nationalism in Turkey.

00:47:06.050 --> 00:47:07.770
In the case of the
Assyrians, it was different.

00:47:07.770 --> 00:47:11.070
It was the Semile massacre that
cemented this nationalist idea.

00:47:11.070 --> 00:47:14.140
The Semille massacre
is a massacre in 1933

00:47:14.140 --> 00:47:21.360
that actually brought the Assyrians
under attack from the Iraqi Army.

00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:24.940
The newly-independent Iraqi
army and some Kurdish irregulars

00:47:24.940 --> 00:47:28.020
that massacred much of the
population in the Semille region

00:47:28.020 --> 00:47:32.500
in Iraq and I think that
moment really cemented

00:47:32.500 --> 00:47:35.720
for these nationalist
sort of debates

00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:41.120
into populist ideas and
into the mainstream.

00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:46.100
Identities were really
affected by what had emerged

00:47:46.100 --> 00:47:49.640
as nationalist ideas and
so I hope in the future

00:47:49.640 --> 00:47:50.960
to continue to debate this.

00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:54.110
As I said, this is a very
early version of the paper.

00:47:54.110 --> 00:47:57.910
So I would love to hear some
comments from everyone, thank you.

00:47:57.910 --> 00:48:05.390
[ Applause ]

00:48:05.390 --> 00:48:07.790
&gt;&gt; Thank you Dr. Davood.

Our next presenter is Alda Benjamin,
she completed her PhD at University

00:48:15.270 --> 00:48:24.370
of Maryland in 2015 on Assyrians in
Modern Iraq using archival sources

00:48:24.370 --> 00:48:30.790
in Baghdad, Mosul, Elbee and Ahouck
in languages raging...ranging

00:48:30.790 --> 00:48:36.750
from Arabic, classical Syriac and
contemporary Assyrian Aramaic.

00:48:36.750 --> 00:48:40.450
She's currently working on
cultural heritage preservation

00:48:40.450 --> 00:48:42.880
at the University Of
Pennsylvania Museum

00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:44.830
and the Smithsonian Institute.

00:48:44.830 --> 00:48:49.210
Her most recent trip to
Iraq was in May 2016.

00:48:49.210 --> 00:48:58.990
[ Applause ]

00:48:58.990 --> 00:49:02.650
&gt;&gt; Alda Benjamin: Thank
you all for being here.

00:49:02.650 --> 00:49:08.620
I want to especially thank Mary
Jane Deeb and Dr. Eden Naby

00:49:08.620 --> 00:49:11.200
for putting this wonderful
conference together

00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:13.840
and for the organizations
that funded it

00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:16.680
and for the Library of
Congress, of course.

00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:19.950
My presentation will take
you to the next 50 years

00:49:19.950 --> 00:49:22.920
after what Fadi just talked about
so you have the basis covered

00:49:22.920 --> 00:49:29.750 position:56%
of the first World War One period
and the first few decades within it.

00:49:29.750 --> 00:49:33.170
So between negotiation
and resistance, Baghdadi

00:49:33.170 --> 00:49:37.600
and Assyrian intellectuals
in the 1970s and in the 1980s

00:49:37.600 --> 00:49:40.730
and they focused particularly
on urban intellectuals mainly

00:49:40.730 --> 00:49:43.470
in Baghdad under the Ba'ath rule.

00:49:43.470 --> 00:49:48.400
So you have to put that in context
that negotiations happening is

00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:53.060
at a time when the state is really
gaining in strength and influence

00:49:53.060 --> 00:49:57.080
so it has to be relatively
sort of to that period.

00:49:57.080 --> 00:50:00.070
And let me just say a
thing about the picture,

00:50:00.070 --> 00:50:01.970
I was just there a few weeks ago.

00:50:01.970 --> 00:50:05.280
This is the Rabban Hormizd
Monastery dating back

00:50:05.280 --> 00:50:07.650
in the seventh century in Alqush.

00:50:07.650 --> 00:50:12.700
It's one of the last
villages standing right now

00:50:12.700 --> 00:50:17.290
and in the plain region
and still has 1600 families

00:50:17.290 --> 00:50:22.090
so it was really nice to be
there to do some research.

00:50:22.090 --> 00:50:28.330
So today I'll analyze the ways

00:50:28.330 --> 00:50:32.680
in which Assyrian intellectuals
negotiated for political rights,

00:50:32.680 --> 00:50:34.940
some are governments
going in strength

00:50:34.940 --> 00:50:37.660
and influence in the early 1970s.

00:50:37.660 --> 00:50:40.470
This discussion is part
of my monograph project

00:50:40.470 --> 00:50:43.700
"Negotiating the place of
Assyrians in modern Iraq"

00:50:43.700 --> 00:50:49.390
which examines the relationship
between a stronger Iraqi state

00:50:49.390 --> 00:50:55.160 position:56%
under the Ba'athist regime
beginning in 1968 and the Assyrians.

00:50:55.160 --> 00:50:58.190
I studied the role of the
Assyrians in the Iraq's leftist

00:50:58.190 --> 00:51:01.830
and oppositional movements in the
second half of the 20th century

00:51:01.830 --> 00:51:06.710
and argue, and I'm giving you the
basic arguments of my research

00:51:06.710 --> 00:51:09.720
because I think it will help you
contextualize what I'm talking

00:51:09.720 --> 00:51:12.600
about because I'm really
just talking about one side

00:51:12.600 --> 00:51:16.310
of this multifaceted
sort of negotiations

00:51:16.310 --> 00:51:18.810
and affairs that are going on.

00:51:18.810 --> 00:51:22.830
So now I argue that within
newly-politicized urban spaces,

00:51:22.830 --> 00:51:26.010
minorities such as the Assyrians
were attracted to intellectual

00:51:26.010 --> 00:51:29.890 position:56%
and political movements that allowed
them to emerge from the peripheries

00:51:29.890 --> 00:51:31.920
and advanced issues
that were beneficial

00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:35.790
to their community while
engaging with other Iraqis

00:51:35.790 --> 00:51:38.950
of their social economic
background and relying

00:51:38.950 --> 00:51:42.190 position:56%
on transnational community
networks influential during the Cold

00:51:42.190 --> 00:51:43.490
War period.

00:51:43.490 --> 00:51:48.350 position:56%
So from the 1960s to the 1980s and I
stopped during the intifada campaign

00:51:48.350 --> 00:51:49.650
at the intifada campaign.

00:51:49.650 --> 00:51:53.280
So in the 1960s you have a lot of
sort of leftist communist activity

00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:54.600
that the Assyrians are involved in,

00:51:54.600 --> 00:51:56.660
you have the Kurdish
uprising that's starting off,

00:51:56.660 --> 00:52:00.740
and the Assyrians have a role
in that as tribal leaders,

00:52:00.740 --> 00:52:04.830
as members of organizations,
as villages who are joining

00:52:04.830 --> 00:52:08.380
against the centralized
government in general.

00:52:08.380 --> 00:52:11.790
And then you have in the 70s,
you have urban intellectuals,

00:52:11.790 --> 00:52:15.110
you have cultural rights
that I'll talk about,

00:52:15.110 --> 00:52:17.490
and then you have the
re-establishment

00:52:17.490 --> 00:52:20.550 position:56%
of the Assyrian nationalist movement
which I'm not sure Fadi agrees

00:52:20.550 --> 00:52:24.110
with me or not, but I call it the
re-establishment because I think

00:52:24.110 --> 00:52:28.360
after the Semille period,
it really, it halts.

00:52:28.360 --> 00:52:31.400
I mean, it's not what it used to
be from the World War I period.

00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:35.110 position:56%
And then again, the Iraqi opposition

00:52:35.110 --> 00:52:39.700
which they become a part
of, on a political level.

00:52:39.700 --> 00:52:43.120
So as a result, Ba'athist policies
towards the Assyrians reflected the

00:52:43.120 --> 00:52:47.680
regime's approaches to internal and
external pressures exerted on it,

00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:50.430
and at times necessitated
the state's attempt

00:52:50.430 --> 00:52:54.160
to attract Assyrian political
and religious leaders

00:52:54.160 --> 00:52:56.890
with favorable policies
such as cultural rights.

00:52:56.890 --> 00:52:59.780
So this is the region
where the Assyrians lived,

00:52:59.780 --> 00:53:03.880
basically northern Iraq, the
modern countries that we have,

00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:07.210
northern Iraq and surrounding
the Ottomia Iran region,

00:53:07.210 --> 00:53:10.690
you have southeast Turkey and then
you have the northwestern Syria

00:53:10.690 --> 00:53:11.990
as well.

00:53:11.990 --> 00:53:15.120
And there actually is
intellectual discussion.

00:53:15.120 --> 00:53:21.250
There really is a transnational
movement of music and of newspapers

00:53:21.250 --> 00:53:22.550
that are going back-and-forth.

00:53:22.550 --> 00:53:24.070
The communities, I
mean, you have borders

00:53:24.070 --> 00:53:28.710
but the communities are still
engaged in various regards.

00:53:28.710 --> 00:53:32.910
The churches that they belong to
and the sources I just list them

00:53:32.910 --> 00:53:35.930
to show you this is actually a
challenge on working on Assyrians

00:53:35.930 --> 00:53:37.320
and minorities in the Middle East

00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:39.280
because we don't really
have a central place

00:53:39.280 --> 00:53:42.540
where sources are collected,
and maybe this is something

00:53:42.540 --> 00:53:46.530
that we can talk about as panelists
at the end of the discussion,

00:53:46.530 --> 00:53:52.260
Iraqi National archives
that I was at.

00:53:52.260 --> 00:53:57.090
Okay. And just a few words, Tomar
Tomas is a leader from Alqush.

00:53:57.090 --> 00:54:01.960
He was very active in the 1960s.

00:54:01.960 --> 00:54:05.770
This is a statue that
is erected for him.

00:54:05.770 --> 00:54:09.460
In 2007 in his village
in Alqush that I was able

00:54:09.460 --> 00:54:15.900
to take Margaret George, another
active militant women who joined

00:54:15.900 --> 00:54:21.130
from the Badua region with her
father and a few male figures

00:54:21.130 --> 00:54:24.890
from her village of Du're
during the Iraqi opposition,

00:54:24.890 --> 00:54:27.640
the Kurdish opposition in the 60s.

00:54:27.640 --> 00:54:31.130
And Ba'athist archives,
you know, State's archives

00:54:31.130 --> 00:54:33.380
that we have clearly
talking about how

00:54:33.380 --> 00:54:35.180
to Ba'athify [assumed
spelling] society,

00:54:35.180 --> 00:54:39.080
and the other hand
we have state sources

00:54:39.080 --> 00:54:43.460 position:56%
on the Assyrian nationalist movement
from the 1980s, so they're talking

00:54:43.460 --> 00:54:45.020
about how they're getting together.

00:54:45.020 --> 00:54:47.380
This is document that
they have retrieved

00:54:47.380 --> 00:54:52.180
from the Assyrian movement
that, a pamphlet that was given

00:54:52.180 --> 00:54:56.850
up to villagers in the north that
the government is talking about

00:54:56.850 --> 00:54:58.800
and Modenarthiraya [assumed
spelling] is a magazine

00:54:58.800 --> 00:55:00.100
that I'll be discussing.

00:55:00.100 --> 00:55:05.860 position:56%
So during the 1970s, Assyrian
intellectuals promoted their culture

00:55:05.860 --> 00:55:08.850
and negotiated for political
rights with the government,

00:55:08.850 --> 00:55:14.700
often framing their concerns using
accepted Ba'athist narratives.

00:55:14.700 --> 00:55:17.250
Negotiation was a process
in which Assyrians try

00:55:17.250 --> 00:55:19.500
to understand themselves
as a community

00:55:19.500 --> 00:55:21.010
and reach internal consensus both

00:55:21.010 --> 00:55:25.190
within the ecclesiastical
communities and between tribal,

00:55:25.190 --> 00:55:28.010
religious and secular leaders.

00:55:28.010 --> 00:55:34.320
The community also negotiated
by trying to position itself

00:55:34.320 --> 00:55:39.030
within Iraqi society in relation
to both the state and opposition

00:55:39.030 --> 00:55:42.080
and also transnationally
with the Assyrian diaspora

00:55:42.080 --> 00:55:44.150
and human rights organization.

00:55:44.150 --> 00:55:49.180
Eric Davis argues about savvy,
non-elite or subaltern groups

00:55:49.180 --> 00:55:51.820
like the Assyrians
began to subscribe

00:55:51.820 --> 00:55:54.640
to historical narratives
propagated by the state

00:55:54.640 --> 00:56:01.470 position:56%
to avoid provoking state authorities
by expressing unauthorized ones.

00:56:01.470 --> 00:56:05.000
But memories propagated by the
state were also challenged.

00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:10.300
The Assyrians among other Iraqi
communities used counter-memory

00:56:10.300 --> 00:56:12.230 position:56%
in their textual or oral productions

00:56:12.230 --> 00:56:16.460
to challenge the state's
interpretation of the past.

00:56:16.460 --> 00:56:19.820
Assyrians like other Iraqi
intellectuals are often successful

00:56:19.820 --> 00:56:24.000 position:56%
in subverting the state's narratives
by incorporating multiple layers

00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:26.740
of meaning into their texts

00:56:26.740 --> 00:56:31.190
to challenge a particular
position propagated by the state.

00:56:31.190 --> 00:56:33.550
I highlight the Assyrian
intellectual production

00:56:33.550 --> 00:56:36.300
by analyzing press
and popular culture

00:56:36.300 --> 00:56:39.140
to understand how Assyrian
intellectuals negotiated their

00:56:39.140 --> 00:56:43.670
interest and related to a state
growing in strength and influence,

00:56:43.670 --> 00:56:47.700
relying on influential publications
such as Modenarthiraya that you see

00:56:47.700 --> 00:56:50.960
on a cover of one of its magazines.

00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:53.120
Modenarthiraya was published

00:56:53.120 --> 00:57:01.000
by the Assyrian cultural
club from 1972 to 1985.

00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:02.740
And it's an excellent case study,

00:57:02.740 --> 00:57:06.240
because it was published
once every three months.

00:57:06.240 --> 00:57:10.370
It really had high
quality of articles in it.

00:57:10.370 --> 00:57:13.600
It was published mainly
in Arabic and Aramaic,

00:57:13.600 --> 00:57:17.840
and you had intellectuals from
various churches, Chaldean Church

00:57:17.840 --> 00:57:23.540
of the East mainly contributing
to it, and not only from Baghdad.

00:57:23.540 --> 00:57:26.290
I mean, you had contributors
from Baghdad, from Kirkuk,

00:57:26.290 --> 00:57:29.260
from Basra, from other provinces.

00:57:29.260 --> 00:57:34.990
You had people writing to the
editors from Lebanon, from Chicago,

00:57:34.990 --> 00:57:36.900
various, I mean, various places.

00:57:36.900 --> 00:57:42.740
There was 2000 copies published
every three months, and the number,

00:57:42.740 --> 00:57:44.590
the quality, the quantity depended

00:57:44.590 --> 00:57:47.740
on the financial situation
of the club.

00:57:47.740 --> 00:57:50.010
And of course, the
government restricted them

00:57:50.010 --> 00:57:55.020
from raising how much it cost to
publish the cost of the magazine.

00:57:55.020 --> 00:57:58.280
So they were dealing
with certain cases

00:57:58.280 --> 00:57:59.580
where they could not publish more.

00:57:59.580 --> 00:58:05.130
But 2000 copies was a
significant number, and in 1984,

00:58:05.130 --> 00:58:08.060
when the magazine is really just
a shadow of its former self,

00:58:08.060 --> 00:58:12.730
the editor tells us that we
send 500 copies to the US

00:58:12.730 --> 00:58:15.440
or to North America
rather and we don't charge.

00:58:15.440 --> 00:58:21.720
I mean, they are just sent
sort of as a gift to them.

00:58:21.720 --> 00:58:25.500
So I'll be focusing on this
magazine and the narratives

00:58:25.500 --> 00:58:28.280
of integration used in
this particular magazine.

00:58:28.280 --> 00:58:34.670 position:56%
In 1972, the promulgation of law 251
by the government extended cultural

00:58:34.670 --> 00:58:38.170 position:56%
and linguistic rights to the
Assyrians which officially referred,

00:58:38.170 --> 00:58:39.670
they were referred
to by the government

00:58:39.670 --> 00:58:42.090
as the Syriac-speaking citizens.

00:58:42.090 --> 00:58:49.920
The preface to the law asserted,
I can talk about this song later.

00:58:49.920 --> 00:58:53.330 position:56%
So basically, just one quick moment.

00:58:53.330 --> 00:58:55.600
So I talked about how
there's negotiation.

00:58:55.600 --> 00:58:59.020
When impressed, they're more
careful in what they word

00:58:59.020 --> 00:59:00.740
and what terminology they used.

00:59:00.740 --> 00:59:04.220
But here's an example in the same
club, the Assyrian cultural club

00:59:04.220 --> 00:59:05.720
where the magazine is published,

00:59:05.720 --> 00:59:09.680
where this is the first record
we have of the Assyrian's talking

00:59:09.680 --> 00:59:13.950
about the Simele massacre which
Fadi just talked about in 1933

00:59:13.950 --> 00:59:16.200 position:56%
of the community inside the country.

00:59:16.200 --> 00:59:17.500
And this is a song.

00:59:17.500 --> 00:59:20.600
Basically, a young high school
graduate who becomes very famous

00:59:20.600 --> 00:59:24.620 position:56%
after the song, sings it in Aramaic.

00:59:24.620 --> 00:59:28.490 position:56%
So what you say, what you sing about
is different from what you write

00:59:28.490 --> 00:59:30.550
about in popular culture and.

00:59:30.550 --> 00:59:35.290
Okay. So let's go back to law 251.

00:59:35.290 --> 00:59:39.470 position:56%
I'm not going to read it, but what's
important here is the terminology.

00:59:39.470 --> 00:59:43.070
So the government gives them
these rights, culture rights

00:59:43.070 --> 00:59:44.720
to the Syriac-speaking citizens,

00:59:44.720 --> 00:59:47.790
and just notice the
terminology that they use.

00:59:47.790 --> 00:59:51.740
So, we're national minorities,
the lost state [foreign language].

00:59:51.740 --> 00:59:54.620
So they refer to them
as [foreign language].

00:59:54.620 --> 00:59:56.550
By the end of the 70s
this changes, right.

00:59:56.550 --> 01:00:01.560
They become [foreign language],
a denomination, you know.

01:00:01.560 --> 01:00:03.220
So the terminology
is really important

01:00:03.220 --> 01:00:05.870
and it's interesting how
the Ba'ath regime frames

01:00:05.870 --> 01:00:08.500
that we're giving you these rights
because you're sort of part of the,

01:00:08.500 --> 01:00:10.810
it's part of the democratic process

01:00:10.810 --> 01:00:15.460
and you are a national
minority deserving to be able

01:00:15.460 --> 01:00:17.810
to practice your cultural rights.

01:00:17.810 --> 01:00:21.480
So the Law permitted the teaching
Syriac language in primary

01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:24.930
and secondary schools where
Assyrians were in majority.

01:00:24.930 --> 01:00:27.280
And also at the University
of Baghdad's College of Art

01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:29.160
and Literature and Literature.

01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:32.400
A special television and
radio programme in Syriac was

01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:34.760
to be broadcast in
Baghdad, Kirkuk and Nineveh.

01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:37.750
So these were large
concentrations of Assyrians.

01:00:37.750 --> 01:00:41.680
Well, Assyrians writers and
academics were to be supported

01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:45.840
in various ways and represented
in Iraqi Cultural Association.

01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:49.900 position:56%
Finally, the establishment of Civil
Society Organizations in the pursuit

01:00:49.900 --> 01:00:51.730
of social, cultural, artistic

01:00:51.730 --> 01:00:54.780
and linguistic objectives
was now explicitly permitted.

01:00:54.780 --> 01:00:56.080
So they're able

01:00:56.080 --> 01:00:59.720
to form organizations
and publish more freely.

01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:03.430
A lot of these were actually
did not materialize so, yes,

01:01:03.430 --> 01:01:05.770
you do have organizations
forms and publishing.

01:01:05.770 --> 01:01:11.030
The schools, they did not really
extend the teaching of Syriac

01:01:11.030 --> 01:01:14.580
to schools so this is just
sort of symbolically passed

01:01:14.580 --> 01:01:15.880
but they were not allowed to do.

01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:18.160
So they do have radio
programs in Bagdad and Kirkuk.

01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:20.680
And so certain things
were passed on,

01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:24.080
others were just basically
cast aside.

01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:27.990 position:56%
Following the passage of Law 251,
Assyrians were cautiously optimistic

01:01:27.990 --> 01:01:30.070
about the cultural rights
granted by the government.

01:01:30.070 --> 01:01:33.810
In the first half of the 1970s
they negotiated for rights

01:01:33.810 --> 01:01:38.180
within about the system,
constructing a historical narrative

01:01:38.180 --> 01:01:40.520
that integrated themselves
into the social fabric

01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:43.710
of Iraqi society since
Abbasid times.

01:01:43.710 --> 01:01:48.280
Assyrian Communists used more
modernist theoretical conceptions,

01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:51.500
drawing on socialism and Marxism
to argue for Assyrians' right

01:01:51.500 --> 01:01:53.070
within the current system.

01:01:53.070 --> 01:01:57.480
A function of the temporary
alignment between the Baath

01:01:57.480 --> 01:01:59.930
and the Iraqi Communist
Party, the ICP at the time.

01:01:59.930 --> 01:02:03.400
During this period, Assyrian
intellectuals celebrated these

01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:05.580
policies but probed the system

01:02:05.580 --> 01:02:08.450
by pushing its boundaries
while maintaining their support

01:02:08.450 --> 01:02:13.340
for Baathism, at times
superficially.

01:02:13.340 --> 01:02:16.610
And integrating Baathist
principles to justify cultural

01:02:16.610 --> 01:02:19.610
and political rights
for their community.

01:02:19.610 --> 01:02:22.550
The regime for its part
temporarily engaged

01:02:22.550 --> 01:02:26.100
in reconciliatory practices
pursuing policies

01:02:26.100 --> 01:02:28.960
that drew the community
closer to it while and worked

01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:33.010
on implementing laws that
projected favorably in the West,

01:02:33.010 --> 01:02:35.420
and meanwhile penetrative
Assyrians' institutions.

01:02:35.420 --> 01:02:39.460
So again this is in the urban
centers, in the non-urban centers,

01:02:39.460 --> 01:02:42.020 position:56%
in the Northern provinces especially
you do have an opposition.

01:02:42.020 --> 01:02:44.280
So this is why it's
important for the Baath regime

01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:46.540
to actually negotiate
and give cultural rights.

01:02:46.540 --> 01:02:50.050
It makes it look good
internally and also externally.

01:02:50.050 --> 01:02:52.920
Some scholars argue
that the Baathification

01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:57.590
of society did not begin until
the Iraq Iran war in 1980.

01:02:57.590 --> 01:03:00.750
My research supports this
position, but points to a change

01:03:00.750 --> 01:03:03.410
of State policy towards
the Assyrians

01:03:03.410 --> 01:03:05.240
and perhaps all Iraqis living

01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:12.040
in the Northern provinces following
the Algiers agreement of 1975

01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:17.870
and particularly 1978 in
Baghdad and other urban centers.

01:03:17.870 --> 01:03:21.210
The Algiers agreement mended the
relations between Iraq and Iran,

01:03:21.210 --> 01:03:24.600
temporarily ending Iranian
support for the Iraqi opposition

01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:28.640
of which Assyrians
were active within.

01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:34.030
So once the opposition became
less significant you see a shift

01:03:34.030 --> 01:03:37.830 position:56%
in Baathist policies so the cultural
rights become less important

01:03:37.830 --> 01:03:40.300 position:56%
and the negotiation sort of changes.

01:03:40.300 --> 01:03:44.600
There is a change of tone that
you see as I said in these cities,

01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:49.530
urban centers in 1978 but in the
rural center really you see it much

01:03:49.530 --> 01:03:53.950
earlier right after the Algiers
agreement is passed in '75.

01:03:53.950 --> 01:03:58.630
So this presentation therefore
complicates the traditional

01:03:58.630 --> 01:04:00.210
scholarly view of the Baath regime

01:04:00.210 --> 01:04:05.040
which often presents Iraqi
society sort of under the Baath

01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:09.290
as being closed and authoritarian
with a system with limited space

01:04:09.290 --> 01:04:11.140
for interaction between
State and society.

01:04:11.140 --> 01:04:13.870
And it shows the Baath regime
basically played politics

01:04:13.870 --> 01:04:22.280
at the beginning, at
least in the early 70s.

01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:23.770
Narratism integration.

01:04:23.770 --> 01:04:26.620
So the Iraqi government
supplemented legislative policies

01:04:26.620 --> 01:04:29.820
with financial assistance to
Assyrian Cultural Organization.

01:04:29.820 --> 01:04:31.320
Mordina [assumed spelling] Suraya
[assumed spelling] became the

01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:33.910
beneficiary of a large
donation from the Ministry

01:04:33.910 --> 01:04:38.920
of Information [foreign language]
and the Union of Iraqi Scholars.

01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:41.340
Government agencies also
engaged the community

01:04:41.340 --> 01:04:44.380
by facilitating international
academic conferences

01:04:44.380 --> 01:04:47.990
that featured classical
Syriac intellectuals

01:04:47.990 --> 01:04:50.970
and invited Western
scholars to participate.

01:04:50.970 --> 01:04:56.100
In February 1973, a festival was
organized to honor Saint Ephrem,

01:04:56.100 --> 01:04:59.680 position:56%
a fourth century hymnographer and
theologian of the School of Nisibis.

01:04:59.680 --> 01:05:06.300 position:56%
And Hunayn Ibn Ishaq which we talked
about from the, he died in 873, 877.

01:05:06.300 --> 01:05:09.860
He was a physician, translator
and active within the house

01:05:09.860 --> 01:05:13.210
of wisdom during that
Abbasid period.

01:05:13.210 --> 01:05:16.190
The man was described by the
magazine as prominent intellectuals

01:05:16.190 --> 01:05:18.460
in the field of translation,
composition,

01:05:18.460 --> 01:05:23.380
and service to humanity
somewhere downplaying Ephrem Syrus

01:05:23.380 --> 01:05:24.680
as the saint of the Church.

01:05:24.680 --> 01:05:30.200
And this was helped by the
Ministry of Higher Education

01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:33.290
and Scientific Inquiry
under the supervision

01:05:33.290 --> 01:05:35.450
and organization of
[foreign language].

01:05:35.450 --> 01:05:39.050
Shamshun Kassum [assumed
spelling] author

01:05:39.050 --> 01:05:42.420
of the article characterizes
this conference as an embodiment

01:05:42.420 --> 01:05:45.270
of the culture rights
granted to the Community

01:05:45.270 --> 01:05:48.470
by the Revolutionary Counsel.

01:05:48.470 --> 01:05:51.760
The Revolutionary Counsel had
dedicated over 10,000 dinars

01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:53.620
which roughly I think at that time

01:05:53.620 --> 01:05:57.550
in the 70s a dinar was
equivalent to US3.00 or so.

01:05:57.550 --> 01:06:01.770
To cover the expenses
of the festival

01:06:01.770 --> 01:06:04.390
which was a significant
first step in demonstrating

01:06:04.390 --> 01:06:07.890
to the community the practical
outcome of its policies.

01:06:07.890 --> 01:06:10.490
Shamshun Kassum [assumed spelling]
briefly describes the significance

01:06:10.490 --> 01:06:14.470
of these two historical figures and
paving the way for the emergence

01:06:14.470 --> 01:06:17.440
and advancement of an
intellectual reconnaissance.

01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:20.360
This reconnaissance had
contributed to the animation

01:06:20.360 --> 01:06:24.030
of Islamic civilization which
in turn had influenced world

01:06:24.030 --> 01:06:27.320
civilization according to him.

01:06:27.320 --> 01:06:29.020
Here Shamshun Kassum
[assumed spelling] departed

01:06:29.020 --> 01:06:31.560
from this general historical
background of Saint Ephrem

01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:35.800 position:56%
and Hunayn Ibn Ishaq contextualizing
these historical figures

01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:38.500
in contemporary affairs.

01:06:38.500 --> 01:06:41.760
So he states the emergence
of the Arab state and despite

01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:44.700
of its influence in Central
Asia following the fall

01:06:44.700 --> 01:06:47.940
of the Persian Empire
was an important factor

01:06:47.940 --> 01:06:51.230
in granting the Church
of the East safety,

01:06:51.230 --> 01:06:53.450
peace and security
during that period.

01:06:53.450 --> 01:06:56.500
In the area of the rightly
guided caliphs the Church

01:06:56.500 --> 01:06:58.330
of the East gained recognition.

01:06:58.330 --> 01:07:03.750
So that its Christian citizens
[foreign language] followers could

01:07:03.750 --> 01:07:05.990
enjoy their full national rights
[foreign language] I mean he's

01:07:05.990 --> 01:07:08.650
talking about the medieval period

01:07:08.650 --> 01:07:11.450
and he's using this
kind of terminology.

01:07:11.450 --> 01:07:17.590
Within the auspices of the State or
Dawla and its official protection.

01:07:17.590 --> 01:07:21.050
Shamshun Kassum [assumed spelling]
used modern political terminology

01:07:21.050 --> 01:07:24.990
that defines the relations between
State and society, citizenship

01:07:24.990 --> 01:07:29.160 position:56%
and national rights to construct a
narrative of inclusion and plurality

01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:31.730
between the Assyrian community
and the ruling authority

01:07:31.730 --> 01:07:34.100
from medieval to modern times.

01:07:34.100 --> 01:07:36.830
He indirectly equated the
current Baathist administration

01:07:36.830 --> 01:07:40.830
to the rightly guided Caliphs
of the Golden Age of Islam.

01:07:40.830 --> 01:07:43.650
During this time, the Baath
regime was a self-propagating,

01:07:43.650 --> 01:07:46.640
a historical memory
that fused Mesopotamians

01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:49.570
and with Iraq's Abbasid
is on the heritage,

01:07:49.570 --> 01:07:53.180
and at the same time demonstrating
support for Pan-Arabism.

01:07:53.180 --> 01:07:55.050
Shamshun Kassum [assumed
spelling] [inaudible] the Assyrians

01:07:55.050 --> 01:07:58.730
within an historical narrative
that catered to have nationalism

01:07:58.730 --> 01:08:00.900
with an emphasis on
the Abbasid past.

01:08:00.900 --> 01:08:03.950
Within this discourse Kassum
highlighted the intellectual

01:08:03.950 --> 01:08:09.540
contributions of Assyrians to Islam
and humanity framing the Assyrians

01:08:09.540 --> 01:08:13.770
of integral native component of
the country deserving a full rights

01:08:13.770 --> 01:08:17.710
and citizens, full
national rights as citizens.

01:08:17.710 --> 01:08:22.800
The Abbasid discourse was addressed
in succeeding issues as well

01:08:22.800 --> 01:08:25.620
where Assyrians appropriated
Baathist language celebrating the

01:08:25.620 --> 01:08:27.720
Abbasid period of the
Golden Age of Islam.

01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:29.910
For instance, the Assyrians

01:08:29.910 --> 01:08:34.010
in the Abbasid times [inaudible]
highlighted the collaboration

01:08:34.010 --> 01:08:35.310
between the Assyrians

01:08:35.310 --> 01:08:39.390 position:56%
and the incoming Arab armies during
the Islamic conquest of Mesopotamia.

01:08:39.390 --> 01:08:42.540
Again, he constructs
this sort of narrative

01:08:42.540 --> 01:08:45.460
where the Assyrians escaped the
cultures of the Byzantine forces

01:08:45.460 --> 01:08:48.980
and although they were
welcomed into Persia and allowed

01:08:48.980 --> 01:08:51.760
to join the Church or
function in the Church.

01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:54.860
Their situation does not improve

01:08:54.860 --> 01:08:56.930
until the Arab conquest
two centuries later.

01:08:56.930 --> 01:09:01.310
And then he addressed the
Abbasid Caliphates again

01:09:01.310 --> 01:09:06.060
and how it included the Assyrians
as members of the community,

01:09:06.060 --> 01:09:09.050
court physicians, translators
and so on.

01:09:09.050 --> 01:09:12.400
Again, illustrating efforts
of the Assyrian intellectuals

01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:16.500
to highlight the history of their
community during the Abbasid period

01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:19.100
for the purpose of
integrating their narrative

01:09:19.100 --> 01:09:22.400
within the officially
recognized narrative.

01:09:22.400 --> 01:09:25.250
The international conference
focusing on Saint Ephrem

01:09:25.250 --> 01:09:28.250
and Hunayn Ibn Ishaw
deployed accepted narratives

01:09:28.250 --> 01:09:32.360
and exemplified what was
permissible according to Law 251.

01:09:32.360 --> 01:09:35.660
The amount of money spent on the
conference was significant even

01:09:35.660 --> 01:09:37.580
by today's standards
and reflected the scale

01:09:37.580 --> 01:09:40.950
of cultural projects the
government was engaged in.

01:09:40.950 --> 01:09:44.100 position:56%
This investment was potentially
beneficial to the state in two ways.

01:09:44.100 --> 01:09:48.350
First, the conference attracted
important Western scholars

01:09:48.350 --> 01:09:49.750 position:56%
with whom interviews the [inaudible]

01:09:49.750 --> 01:09:51.980
and Mordina [assumed spelling]
Suraya [assumed spelling].

01:09:51.980 --> 01:09:54.330
This is important because
the Kurdish opposition

01:09:54.330 --> 01:09:57.880
which included Assyrians was
actively seeking international

01:09:57.880 --> 01:10:01.260
support in its campaign
against the Iraqi state.

01:10:01.260 --> 01:10:02.650
The pressing of Western scholars

01:10:02.650 --> 01:10:05.740
and publicity could assist the
newly founded Baathist State

01:10:05.740 --> 01:10:08.930
and portraying itself in a
positive light especially given the

01:10:08.930 --> 01:10:11.680
conferences emphasis on
Christian minorities.

01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:15.130
Second, the government was
actively seeking the support

01:10:15.130 --> 01:10:19.630
and indeed pursuing the co-optation
of the Assyrian community.

01:10:19.630 --> 01:10:22.280
This conference sought to
demonstrate to the community

01:10:22.280 --> 01:10:25.170
that the regime was
willing to implement Law 251

01:10:25.170 --> 01:10:27.170
and promote the Syriac
language and culture.

01:10:27.170 --> 01:10:29.530
Come on [inaudible] next.

01:10:29.530 --> 01:10:31.180
Okay so I will finish here.

01:10:31.180 --> 01:10:34.060
So this is something that
is happening in Baghdad,

01:10:34.060 --> 01:10:38.790
I mean there are other examples of
Kirkuk where they have a conference

01:10:38.790 --> 01:10:41.980
where they are celebrating
the Revolution of,

01:10:41.980 --> 01:10:46.900
the anniversary of the Revolution.

01:10:46.900 --> 01:10:49.260
Whereas the Revolution
of the Baathist regime,

01:10:49.260 --> 01:10:50.560
of course the Baathist Revolution.

01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:52.110
Whereas if you look at the contents

01:10:52.110 --> 01:10:54.120
of the program I mean
they have [inaudible],

01:10:54.120 --> 01:10:58.550
they have single singing group
[foreign language] awaking or use

01:10:58.550 --> 01:11:02.440
which is a national song
from the 1920s, right?

01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:08.180 position:56%
They have performers who are out
playing the song, and you have a lot

01:11:08.180 --> 01:11:10.990
of other speakers who sort of
if you know their background

01:11:10.990 --> 01:11:14.670
and you've read their
writing from previous periods

01:11:14.670 --> 01:11:16.510
from previous years, you know,

01:11:16.510 --> 01:11:20.610
that there are really just paying
lip service to the Baathist regime.

01:11:20.610 --> 01:11:23.430
So it's really interesting
how intellectuals sort

01:11:23.430 --> 01:11:27.200
of know what the parameters
are but they still try to shift

01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:33.030
and negotiate and use terminology
that's accepted and use language

01:11:33.030 --> 01:11:35.890
which is frames this loss.

01:11:35.890 --> 01:11:40.460
So it's a way of allowing
themselves to insert themselves

01:11:40.460 --> 01:11:45.900
in this narrative, to push the
boundaries while still sort

01:11:45.900 --> 01:11:49.790
of maintaining the
boundaries and not being,

01:11:49.790 --> 01:11:51.460
you know, seriously effective.

01:11:51.460 --> 01:11:55.260
And we know that by the end
of the 70s a lot of the shifts

01:11:55.260 --> 01:11:57.790 position:56%
and changes Mordina [assumed
spelling] Suraya [assumed spelling],

01:11:57.790 --> 01:12:00.940
the way the magazine cover
which incorporated Assyrian art

01:12:00.940 --> 01:12:05.530
for example, from ancient to modern
periods changes and it becomes,

01:12:05.530 --> 01:12:07.260
you now, you see pictures
of Saddam Hussein,

01:12:07.260 --> 01:12:10.690 position:56%
you see pictures of the war efforts.

01:12:10.690 --> 01:12:15.500
And this tone of negotiation
and resistance that you found

01:12:15.500 --> 01:12:19.870
in the early 70s sort of
disappears in the late 70s

01:12:19.870 --> 01:12:21.850
and especially in the 80s.

01:12:21.850 --> 01:12:25.130
In the Assyrians sections you
read columns sometimes and you say

01:12:25.130 --> 01:12:26.650
to yourself, well,
there must be a lot

01:12:26.650 --> 01:12:28.830
of multiple layers of meaning here.

01:12:28.830 --> 01:12:34.490
There's a lot of symbolism here but
that engagement of intellectuals

01:12:34.490 --> 01:12:38.730
that you found in the 70s you
do not find again in the 1980s.

01:12:38.730 --> 01:12:40.530
Thank you so much.

01:12:40.530 --> 01:12:47.430
[ Applause ]

01:12:47.430 --> 01:12:49.170
&gt;&gt; Thank you Doctor Benjamen.

01:12:49.170 --> 01:12:54.340
Our next speaker, Eden Naby,
is a cultural historian

01:12:54.340 --> 01:12:56.850
of the Middle East and
Central Asia who has moved

01:12:56.850 --> 01:13:01.870
from studying Middle East religious
and ethnic minorities to focusing

01:13:01.870 --> 01:13:05.300
on the modern Assyrians,
particularly,

01:13:05.300 --> 01:13:09.840 position:56%
on issues of cultural
preservation among the many articles

01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:12.740
on Assyrians are the key
introduction to Assyrians

01:13:12.740 --> 01:13:15.010
in the former Soviet Union.

01:13:15.010 --> 01:13:19.700
The use of the pre-World War
I Assyrian periodical press

01:13:19.700 --> 01:13:25.460
to analyze Assyrian cultural
progress 1977 and 2006,

01:13:25.460 --> 01:13:29.150
and her work at the foundation
for endangered languages

01:13:29.150 --> 01:13:31.880
and the encyclopedia Iranica.

01:13:31.880 --> 01:13:36.820
Her books include Afghanistan,
Molar Marks and Mujahids [phonetic]

01:13:36.820 --> 01:13:40.510
and the forthcoming
Assyrians of the Middle East.

01:13:40.510 --> 01:13:48.930
[ Applause ]

01:13:48.930 --> 01:13:52.310
&gt;&gt; Eden Naby: Thank you, and
thank you all for coming.

01:13:52.310 --> 01:14:03.420
I know this is the last
presentations so try to stay awake.

01:14:03.420 --> 01:14:09.160
The preservation of Aramaic through
music and word needs a little bit

01:14:09.160 --> 01:14:12.210
of introduction with
regard to the background

01:14:12.210 --> 01:14:17.520
of the cultural development of the
Assyrians in the modern period.

01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:23.500 position:56%
So up to the 1850s the life of the
Assyrian community was largely built

01:14:23.500 --> 01:14:29.820
around their church communities,
their villages, and the main mode

01:14:29.820 --> 01:14:33.530
of sustenance, economic
sustenance for the agriculture,

01:14:33.530 --> 01:14:38.560
and in some areas this was
sustenance, bare sustenance.

01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:43.800
And so there was an interest
in going abroad for work

01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:47.740
because there were certain kinds
of employment that were close

01:14:47.740 --> 01:14:51.120
to Assyrians as they
were to the Jews.

01:14:51.120 --> 01:15:00.280
So the Assyrians began their first
cross-border migrations toward

01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:05.540 position:56%
Russia, the tsarist Russia and
there was a lot of, there were a lot

01:15:05.540 --> 01:15:09.260
of people who went there for
seasonal work as did Armenians.

01:15:09.260 --> 01:15:14.250 position:56%
Other Assyrians, particularly, among
the Chaldean community were involved

01:15:14.250 --> 01:15:20.420
in the age-old millennia old
as we say pattern of trade

01:15:20.420 --> 01:15:24.060
across various borders, it's
usually not long distance trade

01:15:24.060 --> 01:15:25.890
but short distance trade.

01:15:25.890 --> 01:15:28.270
And this continued to be the way

01:15:28.270 --> 01:15:32.200
that the pre-modern
Assyrians led their lives,

01:15:32.200 --> 01:15:37.410
their economic lives
and their social lives.

01:15:37.410 --> 01:15:42.520
However, as many of you know,
the presence of American

01:15:42.520 --> 01:15:45.070
and British missionaries
that we've referred to

01:15:45.070 --> 01:15:47.120
and American missionaries

01:15:47.120 --> 01:15:51.750
in particular made a profound
difference in the question

01:15:51.750 --> 01:15:59.800 position:56%
of language preservation and the
commitment of the vernacular dialect

01:15:59.800 --> 01:16:03.960
to the written word
and the printed word.

01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:07.750
With the coming of the American
missionaries in Northwest Iran

01:16:07.750 --> 01:16:11.720
in particular, we have
the beginning of schools

01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:16.880
that are secular schools
conducted in the language

01:16:16.880 --> 01:16:18.840
that is spoken by the Assyrians.

01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:21.020
Some of this activity
activity was also undertaken

01:16:21.020 --> 01:16:25.500
by French missionaries both
in Northern Iraq, in Mosul

01:16:25.500 --> 01:16:32.190
and in those areas as
well as in the Ormy area

01:16:32.190 --> 01:16:35.320
of Northwest Iran especially
Thalamus [assumed spelling].

01:16:35.320 --> 01:16:42.390 position:56%
However, despite all the strength of
the, represented by this resurgence

01:16:42.390 --> 01:16:49.690
of support from abroad and to
some extent the remunerations

01:16:49.690 --> 01:16:55.370
that were sent from those who went
to work first in Russia and then

01:16:55.370 --> 01:16:57.930
in the United States in particular.

01:16:57.930 --> 01:17:03.720
Despite all of this, the entire
Assyrian progress in culture

01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:08.690
and education was totally
destroyed by the genocide

01:17:08.690 --> 01:17:14.080
of the First World War to be
followed by the smaller incident

01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:20.300
but significant politically hard
just as much of Simele in 1933.

01:17:20.300 --> 01:17:22.910
With genocide displacement
and immigration,

01:17:22.910 --> 01:17:29.780
two thirds of the population of the
Assyrians was lost, to conversion,

01:17:29.780 --> 01:17:32.020
murder, starvation and flight.

01:17:32.020 --> 01:17:36.250
Most were forbidden to
return to their homeland,

01:17:36.250 --> 01:17:38.570
this is especially true in Iran

01:17:38.570 --> 01:17:44.090
because in Iran the Assyrians had
a strong claim to the Ormy area.

01:17:44.090 --> 01:17:48.580
And our two speakers referred
in part some of the reasons why

01:17:48.580 --> 01:17:52.680
but they were prevented
from returning to Iran

01:17:52.680 --> 01:17:58.290
in some cases I know you have
experienced a family having

01:17:58.290 --> 01:18:01.370
to change their names from
Assyrian to Armenian in order

01:18:01.370 --> 01:18:05.690
to be able to return to Iran.

01:18:05.690 --> 01:18:12.900
In diaspora then which now
means includes over half

01:18:12.900 --> 01:18:15.190
of the world Assyrian
population especially

01:18:15.190 --> 01:18:20.870
with the most recent
devastation in Mesopotamia.

01:18:20.870 --> 01:18:26.880 position:56%
Economically, the Assyrian community
we can say is thriving now,

01:18:26.880 --> 01:18:30.570
there are many professionals, there
are many people who are carving

01:18:30.570 --> 01:18:34.040
out lives that are
economically stable,

01:18:34.040 --> 01:18:36.580
but culturally the
community is starving.

01:18:36.580 --> 01:18:40.400
As one of the leading proponents

01:18:40.400 --> 01:18:45.390
of cultural advancement has said
recently that our community,

01:18:45.390 --> 01:18:49.030
the Assyrians, because of
their constant refugee status

01:18:49.030 --> 01:18:54.570
from the 1920s where they
emerge, they educate,

01:18:54.570 --> 01:18:58.730
they establish themselves and
then in the 40s comes another,

01:18:58.730 --> 01:19:05.360
another surge of immigrants and
refugees and so on in the 1960s

01:19:05.360 --> 01:19:07.540
in particular in the 80s.

01:19:07.540 --> 01:19:11.560
So there is this constant feeding
of the community and distraction

01:19:11.560 --> 01:19:14.470
of the community in
order, from economic,

01:19:14.470 --> 01:19:20.130
for economic advancement away
from cultural facilities.

01:19:20.130 --> 01:19:26.300
So the economic strength now
is fairly well developed,

01:19:26.300 --> 01:19:28.360
not as much as some
of their neighbours

01:19:28.360 --> 01:19:31.680
and certainly there are no
resources, state resources

01:19:31.680 --> 01:19:34.260
to support this as
in the case of many

01:19:34.260 --> 01:19:36.840
of the other minorities
in the Middle East.

01:19:36.840 --> 01:19:41.790
But culturally the Assyrian
community in diaspora

01:19:41.790 --> 01:19:45.320
and the biggest communities I think
currently are probably Australia

01:19:45.320 --> 01:19:49.990
and North America as
well as northern Europe,

01:19:49.990 --> 01:19:53.190
Sweden and the Scandinavians
countries Finland are fairly

01:19:53.190 --> 01:19:54.490
strong now.

01:19:54.490 --> 01:19:56.890
Because there is a
considerable amount of social

01:19:56.890 --> 01:20:00.600
and cultural support there from
the state, in the US there isn't.

01:20:00.600 --> 01:20:06.040
So there is a cultural weakness,
language loss, loss of creativity

01:20:06.040 --> 01:20:10.040
in arts and literature in
particular, lack of familiarity

01:20:10.040 --> 01:20:15.010
with their own modern history due
to Middle Eastern school education.

01:20:15.010 --> 01:20:21.700
So some of them were educated in
Aramaic, in Iran, in Iraq, in Syria

01:20:21.700 --> 01:20:23.710
and then these schools were closed.

01:20:23.710 --> 01:20:25.010
In Iran there are not closed

01:20:25.010 --> 01:20:29.690
but they are extremely
restricted since the 1980s.

01:20:29.690 --> 01:20:33.500
So there is also the
outsider distortion of history

01:20:33.500 --> 01:20:38.580
of the Assyrians, there is a far
greater focus on church divisions

01:20:38.580 --> 01:20:40.450
in the Assyrian community,

01:20:40.450 --> 01:20:47.080 position:56%
various patriarchates then there
are the factors that unite Assyrians

01:20:47.080 --> 01:20:51.670
which is their language and
their historical narrative.

01:20:51.670 --> 01:20:57.510
The rise of nationalism as Alda
has said or was it you Fadi?

01:20:57.510 --> 01:21:02.790
Nationalisms in the Middle East and
the post-World War II period meant

01:21:02.790 --> 01:21:06.260 position:56%
that there is non-recognition of the
Assyrian ethnicity and I think Alda

01:21:06.260 --> 01:21:10.610
and Fadi have both spoken to
this very well, only recognition

01:21:10.610 --> 01:21:12.270
of the church institutions.

01:21:12.270 --> 01:21:17.730
Now, I say except Iran I don't mean
that Iran is exceptionally good

01:21:17.730 --> 01:21:21.560
in this regard, but there is
some difference between how Iran

01:21:21.560 --> 01:21:25.620
and the rest of the Middle
East regard the Assyrians

01:21:25.620 --> 01:21:26.950
in terms of ethnicity.

01:21:26.950 --> 01:21:30.110
The churches are not active

01:21:30.110 --> 01:21:34.640
in promoting the living
language but mainly Syriac.

01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:39.310
Syriac is an Aramaic language and
sometimes it wasn't very clear

01:21:39.310 --> 01:21:42.280
in this conference, it is an
Aramaic language developed

01:21:42.280 --> 01:21:46.160
in Ohai [assumed spelling] but
it is now a liturgical language,

01:21:46.160 --> 01:21:48.150
it's not a spoken language.

01:21:48.150 --> 01:21:52.390
It is the language of the chants
and all of the Assyrian Churches.

01:21:52.390 --> 01:21:57.240
Imagine a whole Czechoslovanak
continue to be taught

01:21:57.240 --> 01:22:01.010
in this Slovak language areas
rather than the living language.

01:22:01.010 --> 01:22:04.620
So the living language in fact
is suffering at the expense

01:22:04.620 --> 01:22:07.240
of the teaching of
Syriac in the Churches.

01:22:07.240 --> 01:22:12.910
The Baathist regime in Syria also
forced closed Assyrians schools

01:22:12.910 --> 01:22:18.010
which had been doing relatively
well in places like Qamishli.

01:22:18.010 --> 01:22:21.110
Iraq had functioning schools
and [inaudible] playing

01:22:21.110 --> 01:22:24.460
and mainly supported by the
diaspora using the books

01:22:24.460 --> 01:22:30.160
of Kurish Fanyaaman [assumed
spelling] who is a relative of one

01:22:30.160 --> 01:22:35.490
of our panelists, yes,
and reprinted from Iran.

01:22:35.490 --> 01:22:42.750
The Syrian Orthodox Church actively
discouraged the literary production

01:22:42.750 --> 01:22:46.170
of [foreign language] because,
which is the Western language

01:22:46.170 --> 01:22:49.310
that is used in the community.

01:22:49.310 --> 01:22:53.650
The spoken and written
language today are largely based

01:22:53.650 --> 01:22:56.660
on the works of Iranian Assyrians.

01:22:56.660 --> 01:23:00.820
Now, I don't say that only because
I come from the Ormy region,

01:23:00.820 --> 01:23:04.630
I say it because the
education of Assyrians in Iran

01:23:04.630 --> 01:23:10.380
and their vernacular language was
far stronger and less restricted

01:23:10.380 --> 01:23:13.870
in the last fifty years than
anywhere else in the Middle East.

01:23:13.870 --> 01:23:21.230
So there is a great reliance on
the works of Assyrians from Iran

01:23:21.230 --> 01:23:26.830 position:56%
for the poetry that exists today,
for the plays and for the histories,

01:23:26.830 --> 01:23:29.060
the anthologies and so forth.

01:23:29.060 --> 01:23:32.500
Even though Ormy was
not the first place

01:23:32.500 --> 01:23:37.500
where the language must vernacular
was committed to writing,

01:23:37.500 --> 01:23:39.160
it was in fact in Alqosh
[assumed spelling]

01:23:39.160 --> 01:23:44.480
about which my colleagues
have spoken.

01:23:44.480 --> 01:23:50.850
Schools, however, In Iran
have had a rocky history.

01:23:50.850 --> 01:23:54.770
The Friday language schools,
Friday being the Muslim holiday

01:23:54.770 --> 01:24:02.070
with when we studied primary
level vernacular in Church schools

01:24:02.070 --> 01:24:05.250
and also in secular schools such
as in Hamagan [assumed spelling]

01:24:05.250 --> 01:24:12.080
in the 1930s and Abadan [assumed
spelling] in the 1950s and 60s

01:24:12.080 --> 01:24:15.760
in Olmin [assumed spelling]
and most importantly in Tehran.

01:24:15.760 --> 01:24:18.140
And I think we have
several people in this room

01:24:18.140 --> 01:24:24.320
who are actually graduates from the
very important school in Tehran.

01:24:24.320 --> 01:24:30.060
In the 1960s, the work of
the [foreign language] Tehran

01:24:30.060 --> 01:24:32.820
which is the youth
organization of Assyrians

01:24:32.820 --> 01:24:36.340
of Tehran became extremely
significant in the promotion

01:24:36.340 --> 01:24:43.410
of literature and history and
poetry as well as performing arts.

01:24:43.410 --> 01:24:49.180
Catholic schools have continued
to teach languages in some areas

01:24:49.180 --> 01:24:53.140
that I have spoken about but the
Protestant schools which had been

01:24:53.140 --> 01:24:59.210
so strong in the late 19th and
pre-Diaspora period have collapsed

01:24:59.210 --> 01:25:02.660
because in 1961 the Protestant
Churches simply pulled

01:25:02.660 --> 01:25:07.880
out of that sort of thing.

01:25:07.880 --> 01:25:12.280
From words to music means
that the tension of Assyrians,

01:25:12.280 --> 01:25:18.660
the ability to support a wide range
of culture was extremely limited.

01:25:18.660 --> 01:25:24.520
So for a long period of time, the
people who retained the language,

01:25:24.520 --> 01:25:28.040
the poetry, the music
were popular singers.

01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:30.050
And here I'm calling them
weddings singers just

01:25:30.050 --> 01:25:34.510
because it's a popular term that is
used in Greek and Jewish culture,

01:25:34.510 --> 01:25:38.820
but in fact these are people who
would perform at entertainments,

01:25:38.820 --> 01:25:41.700
they would New Year's
celebrations and so forth.

01:25:41.700 --> 01:25:50.730
And they would sing songs that
related to patriotism rather

01:25:50.730 --> 01:25:55.110
than simply I love you, you are
my love, and so forth and so on.

01:25:55.110 --> 01:26:00.190
There was that too but interspersed
in all of these was a great deal

01:26:00.190 --> 01:26:02.830
of patriotic poetry
and patriotic music.

01:26:02.830 --> 01:26:06.510
Some of it written by the
performance themselves.

01:26:06.510 --> 01:26:08.030
This particular gentleman born

01:26:08.030 --> 01:26:14.790
in Baghdad 1949 [inaudible]
is probably the best known

01:26:14.790 --> 01:26:19.840 position:56%
and the best loved of the persons
in this category of Assyrian singers

01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:23.050
who are still revered I would say

01:26:23.050 --> 01:26:26.200
because of the role they had
played in retaining patriotism.

01:26:26.200 --> 01:26:32.300
Art songs, compositions from the
19th century are mainly lost,

01:26:32.300 --> 01:26:34.190
mainly due to the Diaspora
and the fact

01:26:34.190 --> 01:26:38.430
that preservation methods were
simply not there as we have them

01:26:38.430 --> 01:26:41.010
in the post-World War I period.

01:26:41.010 --> 01:26:47.360
Some of the early 78 RPMs recorded
are often from the Diaspora dealing

01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:52.060
with themes of nationalism
in some instances

01:26:52.060 --> 01:26:56.140
in some [inaudible] history and
some instances playing love songs

01:26:56.140 --> 01:27:00.060
but all in the Aramaic language.

01:27:00.060 --> 01:27:04.920
Poetry, theater and the performing
arts preservation have been

01:27:04.920 --> 01:27:09.690
difficult as I have been saying
but we do have some anthologies

01:27:09.690 --> 01:27:14.760
of poetry from the late 19th
and 20th century, not much.

01:27:14.760 --> 01:27:18.410
But these have been preserved in a
book by Samath [assumed spelling]

01:27:18.410 --> 01:27:23.840
to which the fundamental book on
Assyrian literature and poetry,

01:27:23.840 --> 01:27:32.140
the book by Rudolph Matsu 1975 I
think is based in large respect.

01:27:32.140 --> 01:27:37.080
Before World War I the Assyrians
in Iran had four periodicals,

01:27:37.080 --> 01:27:41.090
the earliest being in 1849 which is
the earliest periodical published

01:27:41.090 --> 01:27:43.090
anywhere in Iran.

01:27:43.090 --> 01:27:48.280 position:56%
And in Ottoman Turkey there were two
and Fadi referred to one of them,

01:27:48.280 --> 01:27:53.340
I think, Georgia there was
one because of this migration

01:27:53.340 --> 01:27:58.230
from Ormy especially to
Russia, Tsarist Russia.

01:27:58.230 --> 01:28:03.230
And then that's about
it before World War I.

01:28:03.230 --> 01:28:08.620
After World War I in the Middle
East in Diaspora there were many,

01:28:08.620 --> 01:28:13.280
many Assyrian publications
in the United States -

01:28:13.280 --> 01:28:15.930
short-lived not institutionally
supported.

01:28:15.930 --> 01:28:20.260
And I was hoping and I know that
the Library of Congress has a lot

01:28:20.260 --> 01:28:22.940
of these periodicals, but they are
very precious and so they're not

01:28:22.940 --> 01:28:26.270
in that room for display but
really they are wonderful

01:28:26.270 --> 01:28:29.100
and a wonderful collection
exists here.

01:28:29.100 --> 01:28:32.960
There are also church
publications, so these tend to be

01:28:32.960 --> 01:28:36.450
in the native language
but in Diaspora they have

01:28:36.450 --> 01:28:38.630
to adopt other languages as well.

01:28:38.630 --> 01:28:42.020
So they are often bilingual
sometimes trilingual

01:28:42.020 --> 01:28:44.300
because of the immigration
especially with Arabic,

01:28:44.300 --> 01:28:49.720
and in the Middle East itself
too they are tending to be more

01:28:49.720 --> 01:28:54.160
and more trilingual and bilingual,
in part because there are fewer

01:28:54.160 --> 01:28:56.250
and fewer people who'd
actually can write

01:28:56.250 --> 01:28:59.340
in these languages in
the Aramaic language.

01:28:59.340 --> 01:29:04.700
And also because of the fact
that their readership requires it

01:29:04.700 --> 01:29:11.870
and there is State censorship
that requires national languages.

01:29:11.870 --> 01:29:14.440
Now, the rights of the theatrical

01:29:14.440 --> 01:29:17.340
and performing arts is an
interesting one and I have written

01:29:17.340 --> 01:29:21.680
at least one article that
specifically about that in Iran.

01:29:21.680 --> 01:29:27.960
But we have the rise of theater
performance in Tehran, in Baghdad

01:29:27.960 --> 01:29:30.600
and in Qamishli, Qamishli all
of you know is in Eastern Syria.

01:29:30.600 --> 01:29:36.590
In the United States because of
the large Diaspora following the

01:29:36.590 --> 01:29:44.340
genocide we have performances
of plays by non-professionals,

01:29:44.340 --> 01:29:47.060
non-professional communities,
social groups and so on.

01:29:47.060 --> 01:29:50.860
Especially along the East Coast
we have some wonderful wonderful

01:29:50.860 --> 01:29:54.440
pictures from that period
where they performed things

01:29:54.440 --> 01:29:55.870
like Arshin Mamalan
[assumed spelling]

01:29:55.870 --> 01:30:00.010
which is an Azarish Turkish
play that is very popular made

01:30:00.010 --> 01:30:02.740
into film four times
at least in Chicago

01:30:02.740 --> 01:30:06.270
and in the Central
Valley in the 1950s.

01:30:06.270 --> 01:30:11.610
In the USSR, the former Soviet
Union there was considerable state

01:30:11.610 --> 01:30:16.300
sponsorship of Assyrian
cultural activity.

01:30:16.300 --> 01:30:22.820
This is because the language of
the Assyrians was recognized as one

01:30:22.820 --> 01:30:25.800
of the nationality
languages of the Soviet Union.

01:30:25.800 --> 01:30:30.060
It came with that territoriality,
but where there were large clusters

01:30:30.060 --> 01:30:34.760
as in Armenia and in Georgia
they had schools of their own

01:30:34.760 --> 01:30:36.070
which was sponsored by the state.

01:30:36.070 --> 01:30:39.660
With the end of the Soviet Union
that kind of sponsorship has ended

01:30:39.660 --> 01:30:46.690
and the community in Russia and
in the Trans Caucasus is active

01:30:46.690 --> 01:30:48.840
but not as active as before.

01:30:48.840 --> 01:30:53.730
So in our time now, in the last
twenty years Europe and Australia

01:30:53.730 --> 01:30:57.560
and the United States have
become refugee locations

01:30:57.560 --> 01:31:00.800
but state sponsorship
of Assyrian activity,

01:31:00.800 --> 01:31:03.760
cultural activity is
very very limited.

01:31:03.760 --> 01:31:08.400
So the community has to depend
on itself, on its own resources

01:31:08.400 --> 01:31:11.840
in order to raise the funds
to be able to perform,

01:31:11.840 --> 01:31:15.650
to create any kind of
cultural performance.

01:31:15.650 --> 01:31:19.170
The content of the plays as I said

01:31:19.170 --> 01:31:21.210
from Arshin Mamalan [assumed
spelling] is an example.

01:31:21.210 --> 01:31:26.020
We also have examples of
adaptations of Russian material

01:31:26.020 --> 01:31:32.580 position:56%
and we have originals skits, plays
based on Assyrian historical events.

01:31:32.580 --> 01:31:35.870
A lot of this is not fully
documented, but there's a good deal

01:31:35.870 --> 01:31:38.960
of material on it that
we have published in some

01:31:38.960 --> 01:31:42.650
of the Assyrian organization
magazines

01:31:42.650 --> 01:31:48.860
such as the Assyrian Star
and these are available.

01:31:48.860 --> 01:31:52.030
Choral and solo singing
of art songs,

01:31:52.030 --> 01:31:55.100
especially in Tehran,
became very popular.

01:31:55.100 --> 01:32:01.060
The inspiration from music, my
eyes over there, the inspiration

01:32:01.060 --> 01:32:04.190
for music is incorporation

01:32:04.190 --> 01:32:08.040
of Assyrian traditional
melodies to Western instruments.

01:32:08.040 --> 01:32:13.430
So the three leading figures for
this kind of activity are all

01:32:13.430 --> 01:32:17.520
from Iran and as you
will see from this chart,

01:32:17.520 --> 01:32:22.750
two thirds have emigrated
and died in, in the West.

01:32:22.750 --> 01:32:28.690 position:56%
So what is happening then is that we
know for example that Assyrian music

01:32:28.690 --> 01:32:33.710
in the ancient period had certain
instruments that are depicted

01:32:33.710 --> 01:32:36.480
or known, and there are
some discussions of it

01:32:36.480 --> 01:32:39.650 position:56%
but there's also some music from the
Ancient period that is performed.

01:32:39.650 --> 01:32:43.880
So what happens is when we have
Assyrian affairs then we have say a

01:32:43.880 --> 01:32:47.270
harp substituting for what
would have been an Ancient

01:32:47.270 --> 01:32:49.410
Assyrian instrument.

01:32:49.410 --> 01:32:55.020
My emphasis for a bit of
this talk is going to be

01:32:55.020 --> 01:32:57.740
on the Mesopotamian night
event which has been taken

01:32:57.740 --> 01:33:01.410
which is celebrating its
10th anniversary this year

01:33:01.410 --> 01:33:04.990
out of San Jose.

01:33:04.990 --> 01:33:12.060
Mesopotamian night is an
organization that tries to have

01:33:12.060 --> 01:33:15.830
through sheer voluntary
activity, Assyrian events

01:33:15.830 --> 01:33:21.050
that include both popular
and new music.

01:33:21.050 --> 01:33:25.810
Mesopotamian night draws
on the works of people

01:33:25.810 --> 01:33:28.800
that I've named here,
composers and poets

01:33:28.800 --> 01:33:32.310
and they also commissioned
new music and new poetry.

01:33:32.310 --> 01:33:37.820
I guess we're not going to
have a sample of the music

01:33:37.820 --> 01:33:42.810
but this is one example of the
event that took place in San Jose

01:33:42.810 --> 01:33:47.190 position:56%
and it's now taking place this event
annual event is also in Chicago

01:33:47.190 --> 01:33:50.460
and in Los Angeles,
hopefully, also in Phoenix

01:33:50.460 --> 01:33:54.160
if you guys work pretty hard.

01:33:54.160 --> 01:33:58.830
Then this is how some
of the work is done,

01:33:58.830 --> 01:34:04.090
it's fairly professional expansion
and then there is the updating

01:34:04.090 --> 01:34:10.240
of popular songs through orchestral
accompaniment and sometimes dance.

01:34:10.240 --> 01:34:15.180
Sometimes this is a real flop
but sometimes it works very well.

01:34:15.180 --> 01:34:20.440
But the future direction,
my particular interest

01:34:20.440 --> 01:34:24.230
over the next few years is in
the Assyrian Arts Institute.

01:34:24.230 --> 01:34:28.000
A new organization which
is very, very different

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:31.070
from the older organizations
because it is committed

01:34:31.070 --> 01:34:35.820
to being an institutionalized
endowed structure,

01:34:35.820 --> 01:34:38.230
endowed is the key word.

01:34:38.230 --> 01:34:43.810
And the commitment is to promoting
language, promoting awareness

01:34:43.810 --> 01:34:47.500
of Assyrian arts and
promoting performance.

01:34:47.500 --> 01:34:53.500
Other promising directions, there
is a new poetry organization

01:34:53.500 --> 01:34:55.790
between Cambridge University
and the Journal

01:34:55.790 --> 01:34:59.510
of Assyrian academic
studies, a collaboration

01:34:59.510 --> 01:35:03.600
that is being engineered
and fostered by a one

01:35:03.600 --> 01:35:04.990
of our current young
poets [inaudible].

01:35:04.990 --> 01:35:09.760
And there are new attempts
to institute schools

01:35:09.760 --> 01:35:12.110
in Australia and the United States.

01:35:12.110 --> 01:35:16.890
But with every generation
of refugees and the debate

01:35:16.890 --> 01:35:18.840
over whether Assyrians
should actually remain

01:35:18.840 --> 01:35:20.520
in the Middle East or not.

01:35:20.520 --> 01:35:23.770
We have the resources,
the financial resources

01:35:23.770 --> 01:35:29.340 position:56%
of the Assyrian community being
drawn away from might have been gone

01:35:29.340 --> 01:35:32.300
into cultural things into
dealing with refugees,

01:35:32.300 --> 01:35:35.280
and that is the sad
part of our history.

01:35:35.280 --> 01:35:37.080
Thank you.

01:35:37.080 --> 01:35:43.870
[ Applause ]

01:35:43.870 --> 01:35:45.930
&gt;&gt; Thank you Doctor Naby.

01:35:45.930 --> 01:35:51.200
We have a few minutes for
questions and answers.

01:35:51.200 --> 01:35:54.620
Two people in this room here.

01:35:59.340 --> 01:36:02.680
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Doctor Davood.

01:36:02.680 --> 01:36:11.230
From the beginning of today we
heard from the history of the dawn

01:36:11.230 --> 01:36:18.460
of civilization till today and it
seems to me that recently we have,

01:36:18.460 --> 01:36:22.250
the world has become
very messy, violent.

01:36:22.250 --> 01:36:27.040
Whereas before every 200 years or
so there was genocide or something,

01:36:27.040 --> 01:36:29.880
now, we have every five, ten years.

01:36:29.880 --> 01:36:33.760
Has anybody done any study as
far as what the future holds

01:36:33.760 --> 01:36:40.060
as this trend is going
to continue or why is it?

01:36:40.060 --> 01:36:43.100 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Fadi Davood: I don't think anyone
has done any studies on the future

01:36:43.100 --> 01:36:49.000
and what it holds but
maybe my co-panelist.

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:50.630
&gt;&gt; Eden Naby: I don't
understand the question.

01:36:50.630 --> 01:36:53.280
&gt;&gt; Fadi Davood: I mean, he's asking
if there are any studies done

01:36:53.280 --> 01:36:56.520
on the future of the
Syrian Community.

01:36:56.520 --> 01:36:58.790
&gt;&gt; Eden Naby: Well studies
can't be done on the future

01:36:58.790 --> 01:37:02.670
but speculation can be made and
there is a great deal of dissent

01:37:02.670 --> 01:37:07.670
in the community about just what
should be done with the community.

01:37:07.670 --> 01:37:13.610
Because the future of the community
in the Middle East is in peril

01:37:13.610 --> 01:37:18.200
and there are many important
voices in the Diaspora community

01:37:18.200 --> 01:37:21.480
who are saying let's not
put those $2 million a year

01:37:21.480 --> 01:37:24.380
into supporting those communities.

01:37:24.380 --> 01:37:29.340 position:56%
Let us use that money to support
communities and bring them out here,

01:37:29.340 --> 01:37:32.520
out to where they can
actually live in some security.

01:37:32.520 --> 01:37:34.880
So that is the discussion
but I don't know

01:37:34.880 --> 01:37:38.170
that you'd call that a study.

01:37:38.170 --> 01:37:40.750
&gt;&gt; Alda Benjamen: Can I also add?

01:37:40.750 --> 01:37:43.590
You know, there is different
voices, you have what people

01:37:43.590 --> 01:37:47.780
in the Diaspora want, what people
in Iraq or the homeland want,

01:37:47.780 --> 01:37:52.330
and sometimes they are not aligned.

01:37:52.330 --> 01:37:55.110
Through my travels I
think a lot of them want

01:37:55.110 --> 01:37:57.710
to remain in Iraq if they can.

01:37:57.710 --> 01:38:00.850
So they do hold on like I
said you know in Alqosh.

01:38:00.850 --> 01:38:03.620
When we went up to [foreign
language] Monastery,

01:38:03.620 --> 01:38:05.470
from the Mountain it was evening.

01:38:05.470 --> 01:38:07.400
You could see ISIS, I mean;

01:38:07.400 --> 01:38:08.860
they told me you see those
red lights over there?

01:38:08.860 --> 01:38:11.060
And I said what are you doing?

01:38:11.060 --> 01:38:12.460
How do you sleep at night?

01:38:12.460 --> 01:38:15.420
But they love their village, they
love their town, they are proud

01:38:15.420 --> 01:38:17.550
of their history and they
want to remain so I mean.

01:38:17.550 --> 01:38:21.360
So there's different aspect of, you
know, there's so many narratives

01:38:21.360 --> 01:38:24.140
that are going on but there's
some studies done on language

01:38:24.140 --> 01:38:28.600
for example the Aramaic
language and the fear is

01:38:28.600 --> 01:38:36.650
that within two generations or so
it ceases to exist in the Diaspora.

01:38:36.650 --> 01:38:38.430
So you know if you have a family

01:38:38.430 --> 01:38:41.550
that speaks Aramaic their
children might speak it,

01:38:41.550 --> 01:38:43.930
their grandchildren might
speak but then after that.

01:38:43.930 --> 01:38:50.860
So you have studies like that on
certain aspects of the culture

01:38:50.860 --> 01:38:53.760
and there's a lot of fear, you
know, if you did lose the people

01:38:53.760 --> 01:38:58.290 position:56%
in the Dias, in the homeland and the
language in the roots that they had,

01:38:58.290 --> 01:39:00.260 position:56%
the connections they had to the land

01:39:00.260 --> 01:39:02.770
and the language then
what happens to us?

01:39:02.770 --> 01:39:05.800
And it goes back to what Doctor
Eben Naby saying, you know,

01:39:05.800 --> 01:39:09.500
do we start focusing more
on the community here?

01:39:09.500 --> 01:39:12.250
Because every wave of refugees,
basically, joins the efforts,

01:39:12.250 --> 01:39:15.780
and the finances of the
community to helping refugees

01:39:15.780 --> 01:39:19.120
and you've been dealing with
that often so you can't focus

01:39:19.120 --> 01:39:24.290
on building schools and on
contributing to arts and so on

01:39:24.290 --> 01:39:28.000
and so forth so it's a dilemma.

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.230
&gt;&gt; Wonderful lectures,
thank you very much,

01:39:30.230 --> 01:39:33.910
very touched by all three of them.

01:39:33.910 --> 01:39:35.880
Professor Davood, I
have a question for you.

01:39:35.880 --> 01:39:38.860
At the time and when you were
talking about the religious factor,

01:39:38.860 --> 01:39:43.710
the third factor and the
nationalism that was happening.

01:39:43.710 --> 01:39:46.740
Was there a distinction at
that point during the Kaldani

01:39:46.740 --> 01:39:49.390
and Chaldeans or the
Assyrians had it happen?

01:39:49.390 --> 01:39:51.650
Was there, was it a
later phenomenon?

01:39:51.650 --> 01:39:53.320
I'm just curious when you said

01:39:53.320 --> 01:39:57.750
about bringing together everyone
Christian, Aramaic speaking.

01:39:57.750 --> 01:40:02.330
Was it the entire Aramaic
Christian speaking part of Iraq

01:40:02.330 --> 01:40:04.510
or was it just the Assyrians?

01:40:04.510 --> 01:40:05.810
&gt;&gt; Fadi Davood: Thanks.

01:40:05.810 --> 01:40:12.090
Well, interestingly Boustros when
his letters in this correspondence

01:40:12.090 --> 01:40:16.870
which I write about says I will
represent all the population,

01:40:16.870 --> 01:40:18.620
the Chaldean Assyrians in sort

01:40:18.620 --> 01:40:22.320
of brackets while [inaudible]
Shamuun [assumed spelling] is also

01:40:22.320 --> 01:40:26.420
interested in her community
of the Nestorians.

01:40:26.420 --> 01:40:29.760
Now, it's a complicated issue
because those who for example

01:40:29.760 --> 01:40:32.640
of the Muslim did not
identify with this community,

01:40:32.640 --> 01:40:37.260
they identify as Arab but part
of the Syriac Orthodox tradition

01:40:37.260 --> 01:40:40.700
or Syriac Catholic tradition
or Chaldean tradition.

01:40:40.700 --> 01:40:44.560
Those who seem serious
co-Orthodox members who were living

01:40:44.560 --> 01:40:46.440
in [inaudible] identified strongly

01:40:46.440 --> 01:40:49.810
with this Assyrian
nationalist phenomenon.

01:40:49.810 --> 01:40:52.840
And actually were producing
a lot of the narrative

01:40:52.840 --> 01:40:55.860
that was actually bringing
this to the forefront

01:40:55.860 --> 01:40:58.740
of the intellectual debate.

01:40:58.740 --> 01:41:01.100
Now, are there divisions?

01:41:01.100 --> 01:41:02.400
Absolutely.

01:41:02.400 --> 01:41:06.200
And even the ideas of these
communities and who they belong to,

01:41:06.200 --> 01:41:11.910
etcetera exists but it did not
really become as entrenched I think

01:41:11.910 --> 01:41:18.590 position:56%
as it did after the Simele massacre
when most of the Urbanites said hold

01:41:18.590 --> 01:41:20.270
on a second, we have nothing to do

01:41:20.270 --> 01:41:22.970
with these people living
in the villages.

01:41:22.970 --> 01:41:26.740
We have nothing to do with these
troublemakers because they wanted

01:41:26.740 --> 01:41:30.710
to survive essentially; they wanted
to politically survive in a state

01:41:30.710 --> 01:41:33.730
that was becoming increasingly
more hegemonic.

01:41:33.730 --> 01:41:39.330 position:56%
And so that's why it's sort of you
see its periods of division and sort

01:41:39.330 --> 01:41:44.950 position:56%
of these things change with
violence, with acts the of genocide,

01:41:44.950 --> 01:41:46.970
with the acts of massacres
and you have one

01:41:46.970 --> 01:41:50.640
that States have embraces them,
everybody is embracing each other.

01:41:50.640 --> 01:41:51.940
I find it really interesting
and then

01:41:51.940 --> 01:41:56.610
in the Diaspora these are
actually a lot less pronounced

01:41:56.610 --> 01:42:02.100
to a certain year because there
are no pressures like them.

01:42:02.100 --> 01:42:03.400
&gt;&gt; Alda Benjamen: Can I also add?

01:42:03.400 --> 01:42:06.020
I mean, in my case, I see
changes already, right?

01:42:06.020 --> 01:42:09.220
So I mean I think in your period
and Fadi I do have a document

01:42:09.220 --> 01:42:11.730
from I think 1919 from [inaudible]

01:42:11.730 --> 01:42:13.720
where the patriarch is
writing to the British.

01:42:13.720 --> 01:42:15.020
&gt;&gt; Fadi Davood: Yeah.

01:42:15.020 --> 01:42:16.780
&gt;&gt; Alda Benjamen: And he's saying
I represent the Ancient Assyrian

01:42:16.780 --> 01:42:18.660
Community and he's from
the Syriac Orthodox Church.

01:42:18.660 --> 01:42:20.540
Fadi Davood: But don't forget
the person that actually goes

01:42:20.540 --> 01:42:22.260
to represent the Syrians

01:42:22.260 --> 01:42:25.130
at the peace talks is the
Syriac Orthodox bishop

01:42:25.130 --> 01:42:26.920
who becomes a patriarch.

01:42:26.920 --> 01:42:30.680
And suddenly when he becomes
a patriarch with the influence

01:42:30.680 --> 01:42:33.990
of the Syrian and the Iraqi
States he becomes an Arab

01:42:33.990 --> 01:42:35.290
so you see that [inaudible].

01:42:35.290 --> 01:42:37.220
And actually if you look and
read the book, I think the book

01:42:37.220 --> 01:42:39.090
in Arabic is called the [foreign
language], the scattered pearl.

01:42:39.090 --> 01:42:42.670
&gt;&gt; Eben Naby: It has
an English translation.

01:42:42.670 --> 01:42:44.950
&gt;&gt; Fadi Davood: Does it
have an English translation?

01:42:44.950 --> 01:42:46.250
&gt;&gt; Eben Naby: Yes.

01:42:46.250 --> 01:42:47.560
&gt;&gt; Fadi Davood: So
it has an English...

01:42:47.560 --> 01:42:51.300
You see, you know, he's an
Assyrian nationalist in that book

01:42:51.300 --> 01:42:54.160
and suddenly that shifts
and changes.

01:42:54.160 --> 01:42:55.520
So I think really the hegemony

01:42:55.520 --> 01:42:58.570
of the Iraqi state plays
a big role on this.

01:42:58.570 --> 01:42:59.870 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Alda Benjamen: So from my period,

01:42:59.870 --> 01:43:03.760
post [inaudible] I see there's
integration, for my period,

01:43:03.760 --> 01:43:05.060
there's a lot of involvement

01:43:05.060 --> 01:43:07.350
in leftist politics,
there's organization.

01:43:07.350 --> 01:43:10.880 position:56%
The community is not urbanized until
the 1950s or so that's when you

01:43:10.880 --> 01:43:12.180
if you look at census records.

01:43:12.180 --> 01:43:15.030
And so they're urbanizing,
they're living together,

01:43:15.030 --> 01:43:17.970
they're politicizing together,
they're inter-marrying.

01:43:17.970 --> 01:43:22.660 position:56%
There you have the dialect that is
sort of like fusing together more so

01:43:22.660 --> 01:43:24.680
and these distinctions
are not important.

01:43:24.680 --> 01:43:27.450
You know, I mean Toma Thomas
I showed him his picture.

01:43:27.450 --> 01:43:29.530
He's from Alqosh, he's a Chaldean

01:43:29.530 --> 01:43:33.290 position:56%
but if you read his memoirs he calls
his town in the Assyrian Ancient,

01:43:33.290 --> 01:43:37.180
Assyrian town and he does
identifies as an Assyrian.

01:43:37.180 --> 01:43:39.130
You know, it's not
it's in his memoirs

01:43:39.130 --> 01:43:41.650
and then Mordina Suraya [assumed
spelling] there was a lot

01:43:41.650 --> 01:43:45.910
of writers, important writers who
were from Alqosh who were Chaldean.

01:43:45.910 --> 01:43:48.910
So the religious identities
in the second half

01:43:48.910 --> 01:43:52.590
of the 20th century is not as
important but then after the Civil,

01:43:52.590 --> 01:43:56.580
after 2003 I think you have a lot
of sectarianism in the country

01:43:56.580 --> 01:44:00.370
and it affects the
community as well.

01:44:01.390 --> 01:44:03.600
&gt;&gt; Eben Naby: Well, let me just
add a very short note to that

01:44:03.600 --> 01:44:07.930
that the root of all of this
identity with Church as opposed

01:44:07.930 --> 01:44:09.560
to an ethnic group goes back

01:44:09.560 --> 01:44:11.780
to the Millett System
of the Ottoman Empire.

01:44:11.780 --> 01:44:15.860
If the Ottoman Empire
only recognized a group

01:44:15.860 --> 01:44:18.750
as a Church community rather

01:44:18.750 --> 01:44:23.560 position:56%
than as an ethnic group then it was
very difficult for that ethnic group

01:44:23.560 --> 01:44:29.780
to emerge as a viable
institutional force in any level.

01:44:29.780 --> 01:44:36.260
And that Ottoman legacy continues
throughout the Middle East,

01:44:36.260 --> 01:44:41.200
it affected Iran less,
less but somewhat.

01:44:41.200 --> 01:44:45.400
But it is true in Turkey today,
it's true in all of the Middle East

01:44:45.400 --> 01:44:49.440
and this recognition of the
community through its Church,

01:44:49.440 --> 01:44:53.810
through its confession is what is
crippling the Nationalist Movement

01:44:53.810 --> 01:44:59.170
in the Assyrians.

01:44:59.170 --> 01:45:00.500
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

01:45:00.500 --> 01:45:03.170
Thank all of you for your
presentations, it was great

01:45:03.170 --> 01:45:06.830
and to the folks from AUA
for having put together.

01:45:06.830 --> 01:45:10.440
This really is a triumph
for our people

01:45:10.440 --> 01:45:12.250
and we're really proud
of all of you.

01:45:12.250 --> 01:45:16.960
I have a question for Doctor Naby,
particularly, about, you know,

01:45:16.960 --> 01:45:20.330
you brought up [inaudible] which
was a really beautiful thing

01:45:20.330 --> 01:45:22.050
that our community did.

01:45:22.050 --> 01:45:25.420
&gt;&gt; Eben Naby: But brought up
what, I didn't understand you.

01:45:25.420 --> 01:45:26.720
[Inaudible] Assyrian?

01:45:26.720 --> 01:45:28.020
What?

01:45:28.020 --> 01:45:29.320
&gt;&gt; You brought up [inaudible].

01:45:29.320 --> 01:45:30.620
&gt;&gt; Eben Naby: Oh, yes yes.

01:45:30.620 --> 01:45:34.790
&gt;&gt; There are a lot of sort
of institutional resources

01:45:34.790 --> 01:45:37.200 position:56%
when it comes to the arts, you know,

01:45:37.200 --> 01:45:41.320 position:56%
watched the National Opera just
closed, the Ring Cycle, for example.

01:45:41.320 --> 01:45:47.120
And, you know, this is a largely
taxpayer-funded endeavour.

01:45:47.120 --> 01:45:51.280
Has the Assyrian community

01:45:51.280 --> 01:45:56.560
or can the Assyrian community use
these national endowments through,

01:45:56.560 --> 01:45:58.810
you know, organizations
like the Kennedy Center,

01:45:58.810 --> 01:46:03.300
like the Washington National
Opera to, you know, put on,

01:46:03.300 --> 01:46:06.460
to sort of bring our
Opera, our literature,

01:46:06.460 --> 01:46:08.300
our poetry to that national stage?

01:46:08.300 --> 01:46:10.940
Because it seems like the
Trans, it wouldn't work,

01:46:10.940 --> 01:46:13.690
on that sort of large-scale and
there was a precedent for it

01:46:13.690 --> 01:46:19.570
in terms of, you know, the WNL, for
example, bringing sort of smaller,

01:46:19.570 --> 01:46:21.700
you know, operettas
to this audience.

01:46:21.700 --> 01:46:25.810
And I'm just curious, that's
something that has been pursued

01:46:25.810 --> 01:46:27.270
or could potentially be pursued.

01:46:27.270 --> 01:46:31.210
&gt;&gt; Eben Naby: I think part of the
problem in our approach to culture

01:46:31.210 --> 01:46:35.850
where we've had even minimal
funds to do it, is that we feel

01:46:35.850 --> 01:46:40.170
that we must and can only
work within our own community.

01:46:40.170 --> 01:46:42.950
I think this is the legacy of
the past in the Middle East

01:46:42.950 --> 01:46:47.530
where we've been so confined that
we haven't been allowed to enter

01:46:47.530 --> 01:46:51.780
into another, into
a national culture.

01:46:51.780 --> 01:46:55.970 position:56%
But, yes, in the United States it is
possible, yes, and I have high hopes

01:46:55.970 --> 01:47:00.420
for the Assyrian Arts Institute
which I think is not only going

01:47:00.420 --> 01:47:08.790
to be quite well-funded but it also
is as part of its vision to enter

01:47:08.790 --> 01:47:16.760
into collaboration with other
parts of state's institution,

01:47:16.760 --> 01:47:19.270
State's Organizations
and festivals and as well

01:47:19.270 --> 01:47:21.470
as on the national level, yes.

01:47:21.470 --> 01:47:24.390
But so far we haven't
received any funds let's say

01:47:24.390 --> 01:47:28.790
from the National endowment for
the arts or humanities in such.

01:47:28.790 --> 01:47:34.580
Yes but only on a minor scale.

01:47:34.580 --> 01:47:36.540
&gt;&gt; So I have two questions for you.

01:47:36.540 --> 01:47:38.240
There's somewhat interrelated.

01:47:38.240 --> 01:47:41.750 position:56%
One I want to thank all three of
you for the wonderful presentations.

01:47:41.750 --> 01:47:45.570
One of the things that we've
noticed in the Syrian community

01:47:45.570 --> 01:47:48.820
and the Diaspora is a rise of
nationalism amongst the youth.

01:47:48.820 --> 01:47:52.260
But at that same time
we've also noticed a loss

01:47:52.260 --> 01:47:56.300
of the actual Aramaic language.

01:47:56.300 --> 01:47:58.390
What do you think contributes
to that?

01:47:58.390 --> 01:48:02.520
And what are the steps at
helping grow the nationalism while

01:48:02.520 --> 01:48:06.320
at the same time encouraging the
preservation of the language?

01:48:06.320 --> 01:48:08.620
&gt;&gt; Eben Naby: Well,

01:48:10.530 --> 01:48:15.330
since preservation was my theme
let me address that very briefly

01:48:15.330 --> 01:48:18.450
and then see if my colleagues
have anything to say about it.

01:48:18.450 --> 01:48:22.310
I think if we look at other
Diaspora communities let's say Ormy

01:48:22.310 --> 01:48:27.080
which is very close to us for
our community even in the future

01:48:27.080 --> 01:48:30.860
of the Persian community.

01:48:30.860 --> 01:48:32.770
What's happening?

01:48:32.770 --> 01:48:34.720
Did you cut me off?

01:48:34.720 --> 01:48:37.670
Yeah. That if we look at the
other immigrant communities

01:48:37.670 --> 01:48:40.470
that are our neighbors from the
Middle East, and suffer from some

01:48:40.470 --> 01:48:47.090
of the same psychological problems
that we have, not reaching out.

01:48:47.090 --> 01:48:54.190 position:56%
That we will see that language plays
a very important role in identity,

01:48:54.190 --> 01:48:58.270
but language is not
the only criteria.

01:48:58.270 --> 01:49:01.740
It's narrative, I mean
how many people

01:49:01.740 --> 01:49:06.300
in the let's say even the most
recent Persian community speak

01:49:06.300 --> 01:49:11.400
Persian well enough so that they
can read the Chach Nama very few.

01:49:11.400 --> 01:49:15.750
But that doesn't mean they are
excluded by the other Iranians

01:49:15.750 --> 01:49:18.810
or shouldn't mean from being
part of that community.

01:49:18.810 --> 01:49:21.780
One of the problems in the Assyrian
community with the waves and waves

01:49:21.780 --> 01:49:25.620
of immigrants and the
differences in dialects is

01:49:25.620 --> 01:49:29.830
that we have said whoever isn't
speaking my dialect isn't a Syrian.

01:49:29.830 --> 01:49:34.180
Alright, it's a very foolish
way of looking at nationalism.

01:49:34.180 --> 01:49:39.260 position:56%
And I would say that if we are going
to exclude as they have in the past

01:49:39.260 --> 01:49:43.430 position:56%
in the 1960s all the children of the
old immigrants were virtually driven

01:49:43.430 --> 01:49:45.090
out of every Assyrian organization.

01:49:45.090 --> 01:49:48.660
Because there was a new
surge of Assyrians coming

01:49:48.660 --> 01:49:51.330
from the Middle East who spoke
the language, didn't speak English

01:49:51.330 --> 01:49:55.080
but they spoke the language
and that's what happened.

01:49:55.080 --> 01:49:56.800
So we are throwing out people

01:49:56.800 --> 01:49:59.160
for no reason even
though they are Assyrian.

01:49:59.160 --> 01:50:03.820
And this is what is happening
to our community, it's a problem

01:50:03.820 --> 01:50:05.120
in the Armenian community too.

01:50:05.120 --> 01:50:10.830
That is language the only basis
for understanding who you are?

01:50:10.830 --> 01:50:13.180
I maintain it's not.

01:50:13.180 --> 01:50:17.320
So even though we should make
efforts to keep the language,

01:50:17.320 --> 01:50:19.650
it's not the only criteria.

01:50:27.410 --> 01:50:33.480
&gt;&gt; I have a, I will direct my
question to Doctor Eden but before

01:50:33.480 --> 01:50:36.340
that I just want to say something.

01:50:36.340 --> 01:50:41.770
When I entered this building and
made my way through all of those,

01:50:41.770 --> 01:50:48.680
the hallways here I was
mesmerized and fascinated by all

01:50:48.680 --> 01:50:52.900
of the mosaic art on the ceiling
and the paintings on the wall.

01:50:52.900 --> 01:50:59.890
My thoughts went back all
the way to the ancient time

01:50:59.890 --> 01:51:02.290
and I almost imagine myself walking

01:51:02.290 --> 01:51:05.390
in Osher [assumed spelling]
[inaudible] Library,

01:51:05.390 --> 01:51:09.110
the library of our ancestors.

01:51:09.110 --> 01:51:15.200
So I can only imagine it was as
magnificent as this building is.

01:51:15.200 --> 01:51:20.620
My question to you is you mentioned
something about the establishment

01:51:20.620 --> 01:51:24.420
of the Assyrian schools in Tehran
and Thalamus [assumed spelling].

01:51:24.420 --> 01:51:27.180
Do those schools still exist there?

01:51:27.180 --> 01:51:32.080
&gt;&gt; Eben Naby: In Thalamus it
was before World War I so, no.

01:51:32.080 --> 01:51:37.670
Thalamus was devastated by Kurdish
and Turkish fighters completely.

01:51:37.670 --> 01:51:42.730
I mean there's hardly any
people left any Assyrians left

01:51:42.730 --> 01:51:44.170
in the Thalamus [assumed
spelling] area.

01:51:44.170 --> 01:51:52.340
The Tehran school functions
but it was extremely limited

01:51:52.340 --> 01:51:54.700
through the constitutional
changes that occurred

01:51:54.700 --> 01:51:57.350
with the establishment
of the Islamic Republic.

01:51:57.350 --> 01:52:07.170 position:56%
So yes, yes it exists, but it limps.

01:52:08.330 --> 01:52:09.630
Sorry.

01:52:09.630 --> 01:52:12.110
&gt;&gt; Okay. At this point I would
like to ask all the panelists

01:52:12.110 --> 01:52:15.760
to come forward because we're
going to take a picture together.

01:52:15.760 --> 01:52:19.910
Thank you all for coming.

01:52:24.390 --> 01:52:28.250
This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
