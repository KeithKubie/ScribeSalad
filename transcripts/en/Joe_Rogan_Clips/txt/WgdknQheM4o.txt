Speaker 1:          00:00          This whole cult thing. I don't get it. So don't is a weird one, right? Because it's all like crystals and healers. It's all people looking to be spiritual that they've given up on traditional religion, but they seem to need that sort of vibe and so they get into like spiritual stuff and channelers and healers. Have you got in that stuff? My mom, I know it all day long. One all about channeling, bro. That's my thing. Channeling. Yeah. All right. I mean, no, no. I think we, I really do believe, and I've, I've been believing this more and more lately though, that our understanding of what our memory is is a very limited, and that the reason why people are scared of things, some things is probably because there's some sort of genetic memory of someone that they knew. Like I bet your kid will have somehow or another that knowledge of that motorcycle accident and that fee.

Speaker 1:          00:57          There's, I think shit like that goes through DNA. Yeah, I do. I think that's why kids are scared of monsters. You know, why his kids scared of monsters? Why aren't they scared of bullets or fires or you know, like why, why they're screaming, they're, they're scared of something that I was scared of growing up. No, there's animals used to eat people. Yeah. That's what I think. I think monster's represent like Jaguars and shit. Like you'd go into the jungle and try to get some water and you get jacked. That's our ancestors. All of our ancestors, every single human being on this planet came from Africa. All of us. 100% of us. Everyone. Absolutely Shin, black, white. All of us got eaten. All of our ancestors in our DNA. It's wired that cats out there, bro. What are you afraid of? Monsters in the dark. Those are cats, man. We got jacked by cats like all the time. Yeah. Yeah. So that's why everybody is scared of things under the bed. What's in the closet? They're hiding their cats. Big Cats looking to get you. I don't know about that.

Speaker 1:          02:03          This was very scary for a moment, but I don't believe in that. Why do you think that animals have instincts, right? Like here's a perfect example, but we have instincts, right? But what kind of instincts? Animals have weird instincts. Like they all sniff each other's assholes. They all piss on spots where other animals did. They don't. Nobody had to teach my dog how to do that. My dog, I got him when he was six weeks old and I've had him for two and a half years. That mother fucker will sniff something and he see somebody peed on it. He pees on it. But he learned that from his, he didn't learn that from nobody. No. He learned that from his dog people. What's it like when you came over here? He didn't know Jack Shit, so he myself oil. You're saying you learned that from us?

Speaker 1:          02:39          No, I think it's in his DNA. Okay. Yeah, I get that. But what is the DNA like? Doesn't your DNA carry some traces of information onto your own children? Like what I noticed in my children, they share certain weird traits that I have that I don't feel like like a obsessive compulsive traits that I don't think they see because don't really bring that home. Like, especially the workout stuff and like some, some things that I really get kind of psychotic about martial arts stuff. My, my middle daughter has that in a crazy way and I'm like, Oh okay, this is me. If I was a girl, like if I was a little girl, this is me. Like what is it? So is this my memory that seen her or is it, do I have like some weird obsessive gene, which is, it is the DNA because I see my son, he's only two, he just turned two.

Speaker 1:          03:27          But he makes facial expressions and looks like he does certain looks that I do and, and my wife goes, he's acting like you right now. Do you think he's acting like you? Cause he sees you act like that or he's acting like you cause he knows in his head that that's how he's wired like that. Because when I watch it, he doesn't know like a lot of this stuff he does, I don't eat, I don't even do, he just does like my mom all, I'll come over and she'll watch them. She Go, you know, he's just like you when you were this age and it's so weird. Yeah. It's in the DNA. It's in something, right. Whatever it is, whether it's in cellular memory, DNA, some sort of genetic information gets passed on, but the parents of the child, you can say that about athletics though. Like if you get too, that's a little different though, but it's in the DNA. Yeah. It isn't the DNA, but it's not an ethereal thing. Like a thought.
