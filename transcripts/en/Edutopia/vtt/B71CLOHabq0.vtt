00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:10.010
- So we're going to have
three stations today you guys.

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:10.843
Okay, Mr. Kiefer.

00:00:10.843 --> 00:00:13.190
- Alright, station one with myself,

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:14.640
Yousef, Abbie, Hayley ...

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.920
- [Teacher] With
co-teaching, since we started

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.890
it's implementation, it's really

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.440
strengthened the learning process

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.600
for our student teachers,
and made a positive

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.680
impact on the students' learning.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.840
It decreases the group size and allows

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.880
more interaction between both the teacher

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.450
and the students, as well as

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.300
the students and their peers.

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:41.730
- The Lab school partners
with the College of Ed

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.240
as part of a teacher education institute

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.250
to help prepare teachers.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.420
- Are humans bound to destroy themselves,

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.010
that's a question, right?

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.460
- So, we get utilized
heavily for a lot of the

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.900
pre-service teachers'
practicum experiences.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.670
- We're gonna be on an adventure.

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:59.750
- Because of that, the teachers here

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.840
have become masterful at really utilizing

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.050
all the adults to make
a positive difference

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:06.780
for the students that they serve.

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.750
- Co-teaching is when two or more teachers

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.730
work together in all
aspects of instruction.

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.850
So from planning, to
instruction, to assessment.

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.130
- We're just gonna take
a look at your writing,

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:19.230
here, I guess take it from yesterday.

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:21.430
- There are always two
teachers in the room

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:22.438
working with students.

00:01:22.438 --> 00:01:23.271
- Helisa.

00:01:23.271 --> 00:01:24.540
- Is what elements of modern warfare

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.830
do you see in Wayne's letter?

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:26.970
- Okay, good.

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.580
- We were given this list of strategies

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.570
in our training, and we were
just asked to think about

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.830
any way that we could try to draw on those

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:35.150
as much as possible.

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.400
So a lot of it is looking
at those strategies

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.909
and trying to match it
with what the kids need.

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:41.710
- We're gonna be in about
groups of four, okay?

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.300
Everybody is going to go
to all three rotations.

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:45.133
Alright, let's do it!

00:01:45.133 --> 00:01:46.780
- There's one that's discussed in all four

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.800
of these pictures, and
what you guys came up with.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.140
- During station teaching,
each of the teachers

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.000
has an individual station
with a different lesson plan,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.610
and students are working
independently at a station.

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.090
- Alright, we are going
to rotate now folks.

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.360
- And it is very valuable
for our student teachers

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.300
to teach the same lesson, numerous times.

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.420
They make little small
tweaks with every lesson.

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.750
- What sticks out to you
when you're looking at this?

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.480
- Blown up trees, injured people.

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.313
- Can you tell me more?

00:02:14.313 --> 00:02:15.950
I think the great thing about co-teaching

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.960
is that having the burden not necessarily

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.210
100% put on you right from the start.

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.030
It's almost a great way
to have training wheels

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.510
if you're coming in
and don't have a lot of

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.130
teaching experience.

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:27.420
Good teaching can be good teaching

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.000
whether it's two kids or forty,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.050
but it's easier definitely
to manager fewer bodies.

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:34.490
So that's kind of one of the things

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:36.150
that Sarah Teasdale's seeing.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.799
- Bradbury's writing about
20 years after Teasdale.

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:42.720
I mean it's what's best for kids, right?

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.000
They can work with me and
Isaac all in the same hour.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.360
Kids aren't gonna fall through the cracks,

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.820
we're going to have lots of ways

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:48.820
for us to reach our kids.

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.400
- They both have
different teaching styles,

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.160
but they work well together so if

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.080
you don't understand one
thing Ms. Markley said

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.110
you could ask Mr. Kiefer,

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.840
and he'll tell you in a different way.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.230
- To be effective at co-teaching,

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.700
there has to be co-planning.

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.340
- So today, we're going
to do our role playing,

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.760
so we're going to be co-teaching that.

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.960
- And we're gonna assist
them with filling out

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.630
their pros and cons sheet.
- Yeah.

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.810
- We plan everything together,

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.440
which helps me, because
through the planning process

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.990
I can ask her questions, so that when I'm

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:20.160
on my own I know what to expect.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.490
- Good morning, good morning.

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:26.130
This morning, Mrs. Montez and I,

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.570
we are going to act out a scene,

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:33.360
that might have happened in 1849.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.040
- The purpose of team
teaching is to seamlessly

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.060
teach together.

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.680
Teachers plan the lesson and
say, I'll take this part,

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.720
you take this part, but both of them

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.150
are actively engaged from the planning

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.330
to the instruction.

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.230
- You have to decide,
yes, I would move west

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.150
during the Gold Rush, or no,
I would not move west ...

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.880
- It makes me a better teacher

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.010
because I want to model for them,

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:00.880
what a good teacher looks like,

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.570
so I am more careful about what I plan

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:06.180
and how I plan it.

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.920
- It changes the role from master teacher

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.090
and student teacher, and
creates this sense of,

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.600
we're in this together, and
we both have important roles.

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.760
When I'm watching her teach,
when she's watching me teach,

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.470
we learn from each other.

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.360
- If you are gonna be a
homesteader, join me over here.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.630
- And anyone who wants to strike it rich,

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.280
come with me!

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.740
- I think alot of the teacher candidates

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.630
come in a little bit nervous about

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:31.530
implementing co-teaching strategies,

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.260
but they leave saying that it
has been a great experience

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.360
and that they feel very prepared to go out

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.230
and begin their profession.

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:40.180
- They do come out as better teachers.

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.860
They're not sitting and watching,

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.167
they're up on their feet, they're involved

00:04:44.167 --> 00:04:46.330
in the planning, and the instruction,

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:47.800
and the classroom management.

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.000
It's good for them, it's good for me,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.750
it's good for the students,
it's great for the school,

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.350
so there's tons of benefits.
