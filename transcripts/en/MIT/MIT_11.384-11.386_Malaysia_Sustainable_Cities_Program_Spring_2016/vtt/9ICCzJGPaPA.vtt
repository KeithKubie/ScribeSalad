[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:09.689 --> 00:00:12.230
JOSE PUPPIM DE OLIVEIRA: Hello,
I am Jose Puppim de Oliveira.

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:15.550
I am an MIT-UTM
business scholar.

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:18.550
This video shares some
lessons of my research

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.750
on urban innovation using case
of waste management in Penang,

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:23.600
Malaysia.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.100
Urban innovation means
doing things differently

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.570
in the urban context.

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.270
Innovation is important for
improving urban services

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.180
in a context where many
cities around the world

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.270
face increasing
budgetary constraints.

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.940
Interaction among
different governmental and

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.690
non-governmental actors
are key to innovation.

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.270
Interactions can bring new
resources and knowledge

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.600
to solve urban problems
more effectively.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.200
The waste sector in
Malaysia particularly

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.030
offers an interesting laboratory
for urban innovations.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.740
The country has tried to improve
waste management effectiveness

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:06.540
in recent years, making a
series of institutional change,

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.430
such as decentralization
of waste management

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:10.780
at the federal level.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:11.140
DR. MOHD PAUZE BIN
MOHAMAD TAHA: Previously,

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.600
the waste management
and public [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.690
is under the purview
of each government,

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:23.090
and being implemented
or being responsible

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.650
is under the local government.

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.240
Somehow, they have a difficulty
to provide sufficient funds

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.180
to manage.

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.430
At the same time do not
have expertise or manpower

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.210
to manage the solid
waste as previously.

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.410
Almost all the waste is
sent to the dumping ground.

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:44.850
Local government asking
federal government

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.060
to provide the fund for them.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.610
We also want the
local government

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.460
to focus on other
areas of services.

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.600
So that's the reason why the
federal things is better.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.960
So the responsibility
of managing the waste

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.777
is put on the federal
responsibility.

00:02:00.777 --> 00:02:02.860
JOSE PUPPIM DE OLIVEIRA:
Peneng Island in Malaysia

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:08.100
decided to keep waste
management under local control.

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.350
GUEST SPEAKER: Actually, the
urban services department

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.510
is in charge of solid
waste management,

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.740
and also public cleansing is the
core business of the council.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.050
The most challenging
part in Penang Island

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.611
is domestic waste.

00:02:20.611 --> 00:02:24.600
Penang Island [INAUDIBLE]
around 550 tons of waste

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.490
is being disposed.

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.900
DR. LIM MAH HUI: The city
council spends about 40%

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:35.020
of its budget just
to dispose of waste.

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.930
GUEST SPEAKER: Our recycling
rate at the moment is 27%.

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.470
With the active role of the
recycling agent, the NGOs

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:48.020
and the environmental group,
in 1998, the domestic waste

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.420
around 700 tons.

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.450
Now it's really-- it's
around 440 tons per day.

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.050
So how we manage to reduce it?

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:03.060
In Penang, we had a very quite
active role of the stakeholders

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.150
doing recycling.

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.340
JOSE PUPPIM DE OLIVEIRA: Urban
innovations reduce the waste.

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.000
We are going to see two
of those initiatives

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.380
to understand how urban
innovations emerge

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.835
through different kinds of
institutional arrangements.

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:27.253
BROTHER SIOW EK: This the
Recycling and Education Center.

00:03:27.253 --> 00:03:30.970
More important is education to
spread and actually encouraging

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:32.580
more people to do
recycling together.

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.850
And in Malasya, it's a long
time the recycling stopping it's

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.700
not part of the life
[? whole ?] practices yet.

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.320
So we have to set up the
proper infrastructure

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.640
to teach the residents how
recycling should be done,

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.140
so that when they
go back home, they

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:50.140
know how to actually
save the item

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:51.710
into the different category.

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:54.650
So we had about 20
were our volunteers.

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.960
In average, per
man, we are running

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.590
about 10 tons of material.

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.990
That cover plastic,
papers, metals.

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:04.195
All proceeds from
the recycling are all

00:04:04.195 --> 00:04:05.820
channelled towards
the dialysis center.

00:04:08.886 --> 00:04:11.010
LEE MEOW HONG: [INAUDIBLE]
Tzu Chi Dialysis Center,

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.430
actually, we started in 1997.

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.089
From the first day, it's
actually free of charge.

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:19.880
Everyone interested to know
how we survive for the past 18

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:20.540
years.

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:24.750
About 70% comes from
donation from the public.

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.209
Another nearly 30% comes
from our recycling.

00:04:28.209 --> 00:04:30.000
BROTHER SIOW EK:
Recycling Education Center

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.930
is something very new.

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.667
When they equate recycling
center equal to rubbish center.

00:04:33.667 --> 00:04:35.250
So when we want to
set up this center,

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.400
the resident community say,
no, we cannot allow a rubbish

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:39.229
center set up.

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:41.020
Then we have to explain
to them, we are not

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.060
setting up a rubbish center.

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.643
We are setting up
an education center.

00:04:43.643 --> 00:04:44.770
No smell.

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:45.680
Line is clean.

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.380
JEFFERY HO: And there is
a mosquito-infested area.

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:51.840
Tzu Chi was willing to
come here to set it up,

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.219
so we work along with them.

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:54.760
BROTHER SIOW EK: We
actually work out

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.444
with the MBPP, the council.

00:04:57.444 --> 00:04:58.610
They do actually facilitate.

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.740
They actually rent to us at
a very minimum rental cost.

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.050
Also, they are very supportive
of our recycling effort.

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.290
And at the same time,
by doing recycling,

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:08.830
we also reduce the
amount of rubbish

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:09.890
that they had to handle.

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:12.070
The whole country goes
for solid waste recycling.

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.100
So we're actually
two years ahead.

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.149
Go green, save lives.

00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:17.940
LEE MEOW HONG: From
the recycling, besides,

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.270
we are doing
environmental protection.

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:22.526
We actually can save life.

00:05:22.526 --> 00:05:24.900
MAGESWARI SANGARALINGAM: So
in terms of waste management,

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.430
it is not the right way
to just think of disposal.

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:30.560
We should try to
reduce the consumption

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:34.040
so that we will also reduce
the production of waste.

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.734
We are trying to promote
communities to be involved.

00:05:36.734 --> 00:05:38.900
From the community, it goes
to the local government.

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:43.890
At least 45% to 50% is
organic waste or food waste.

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:47.280
How, in the first place, can you
reduce food waste, the kitchen

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.655
peelings or the green waste
which can go into composting.

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:54.980
JOSE PUPPIM DE OLIVEIRA:
Composting is the second case

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:56.470
of urban innovation.

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:58.560
You reach the private
sector partners

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.892
with this public sector
in civil society.

00:06:00.892 --> 00:06:02.350
SOH YEW AUN: Most
of the problem is

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:04.980
that the people expect
the government to handle

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:06.076
the obvious.

00:06:06.076 --> 00:06:07.200
Waste is not their problem.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.090
It's government's problem.

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:12.430
How people look at food waste,
because to them, it is a waste.

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:14.860
But to the world, it
is actually a resource.

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:18.330
Most recycling companies
don't survive for long,

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:21.780
because the cost is too
high to do recycling.

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:25.299
And the economic return
sort of value is too low.

00:06:25.299 --> 00:06:27.590
The only way for them to make
money is, of course, then

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:31.380
to look at government subsidies,
looking at government credit

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:32.190
mechanisms.

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:34.020
We have come up with
something that we know

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:36.380
that is economically feasible.

00:06:50.296 --> 00:06:51.380
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:07:02.727 --> 00:07:05.185
CHIN KEE WONG: Methodist Boys'
School, a few years back, we

00:07:05.185 --> 00:07:07.585
were approached by
one of our old boys,

00:07:07.585 --> 00:07:10.670
who also happened to be
a councilor in the city

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:11.440
council in Penang.

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.940
So he came up with the idea
of turning the school green.

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:17.760
All canteen waste,
especially food waste,

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:20.600
churned up in the
machine and converted

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:24.760
into enzymes, which later we
converted into fertilizer.

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:27.870
And that fertilizer, we
brought to our eco-green farm.

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:30.680
NG CHUN WEI: We have a
daily schedule for Monday

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:33.260
to Friday for all
these food [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.420
to collect the food waste
from the canteen just

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:36.360
to be processed here.

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:38.710
WONG CHIEW LEE: We
have the fruit section.

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:42.230
We also have the herbal
section, kitchen remedies.

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:44.080
Over the other
side, you will find

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:47.045
that we have this rainwater
harvesting system.

00:07:47.045 --> 00:07:50.890
So this is some collaboration
with USM, [NON-ENGLISH].

00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:00.201
SOH YEW AUN: In Penang Hills,
we deal with the end product

00:08:00.201 --> 00:08:00.700
differently.

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:03.420
We ferment the food
waste here itself,

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:05.400
without taking back
to the factories.

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:09.480
And then we use the fermented
food waste to treat sewage.

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:12.560
And the [INAUDIBLE] has got no
smell and no oil accumulation,

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:13.687
no grease accumulation.

00:08:13.687 --> 00:08:15.270
If you ask me, I
think a lot of things

00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:17.805
work better on a small
scale than on a large scale.

00:08:17.805 --> 00:08:18.930
Everybody has to cooperate.

00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:20.888
You can develop the best
machines in the world,

00:08:20.888 --> 00:08:22.312
but if the people
don't cooperate,

00:08:22.312 --> 00:08:24.020
the machine's not
going to run by itself.

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:25.870
Food waste doesn't get
separated by itself.

00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:26.690
You need people.

00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:28.406
Everybody has to
chip in some way.

00:08:28.406 --> 00:08:30.530
And this is where we are
going on with the schools,

00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:33.320
to start teaching the students
of the importance of actually

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:35.309
separating your food
waste and making sure

00:08:35.309 --> 00:08:37.017
that they're going to
the correct places.

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:42.600
JOSE PUPPIM DE OLIVEIRA: Three
main lessons from the case.

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:46.020
First, innovation
capabilities were

00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:49.920
created by involving
various stakeholders.

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:52.830
Second, broad
stakeholder involvement

00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:56.590
brought resources, like
knowledge and finance

00:08:56.590 --> 00:08:58.480
from various sources.

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:02.310
These would not be possible if
a stakeholder was working alone.

00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:05.960
Third, innovations were
able to connect waste

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:09.350
with other issues,
such as health, sewage

00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:11.330
treatment, and education.

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:15.230
Innovation can overcome problems
of collective action, where

00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:16.859
many stakeholders
must work together.

00:09:16.859 --> 00:09:18.400
MAGESWARI SANGARALINGAM:
There should

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:21.270
be awareness amongst
the communities

00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:24.165
on how to reduce the waste, and
also in terms of the industry.

00:09:24.165 --> 00:09:27.710
And so there are lot of
players in the field of waste

00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:31.977
management which everyone
has to take part in.

00:09:31.977 --> 00:09:34.310
JOSE PUPPIM DE OLIVEIRA: The
state and local authorities

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:37.640
have helped to scale up such
initiatives by providing

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:40.450
support to coordinate
the different efforts

00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:43.340
from federal government,
civil society,

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:45.170
and link them with citizens.

00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:47.390
MUBARAK BIN JUNUS: We
still feel that there

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:49.760
is something to be done more.

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:54.850
We already come up to the policy
in line with the federal policy

00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:57.680
to come up with the
mechanism of collections.

00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:00.410
We are now going to use the
same mechanism as federal,

00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:01.430
what they are doing.

00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:03.600
We are going to
improvise this according

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:05.467
to our own local environment.

00:10:05.467 --> 00:10:07.050
JOSE PUPPIM DE
OLIVEIRA: A combination

00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:09.700
of top-down efforts
from governments

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:13.270
to support initiatives of
bottom-up urban innovation

00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:16.715
brings the right combination
to nurture broad transformation

00:10:16.715 --> 00:10:18.467
in urban services delivery.

00:10:20.262 --> 00:10:22.470
MAGESWARI SANGARALINGAM:
The way you're disposing it,

00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:25.320
whether you're landfilling
or you're incinerating,

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:29.250
or you're just dumping,
it's all causing problems

00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:32.840
for the climate, too, because
of the greenhouse gas emissions.

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:39.690
ANTHONY CAPON: How can we make
a city suitable for our bodies

00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:41.110
and our health?

00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:43.940
We have designed and
managed cities often

00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:46.340
in the interest of
motorcars, rather than

00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:48.800
in the interests of people.

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:53.630
We need to rethink the city
in the interest of people.

00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:55.130
MUBARAK BIN JUNUS:
Even though there

00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:58.040
is some initiative
being done, but still

00:10:58.040 --> 00:10:59.986
the mindset still
needs to be changed.

00:10:59.986 --> 00:11:02.700
DR. YUEH-KWONG LEONG: The
current concept of development

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:06.125
is the more buildings they have,
the more industries they have,

00:11:06.125 --> 00:11:09.690
the more developed you are,
the better you will become.

00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:14.270
But they have not
factored in, actually,

00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:19.067
the cost in terms of pollution,
in terms of traffic congestion.

00:11:19.067 --> 00:11:21.150
JOSE PUPPIM DE OLIVEIRA:
Creating the capabilities

00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:23.345
to innovate in governments
and civil society

00:11:23.345 --> 00:11:27.170
is crucial to combating global
problems such as climate

00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:31.890
change, which requires a higher
degree of collective action

00:11:31.890 --> 00:11:34.940
to design and manage the
cities of the future.

00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:37.650
This will require
innovation in our thinking

00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:40.790
about how we carry
out urban development.

00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:44.440
