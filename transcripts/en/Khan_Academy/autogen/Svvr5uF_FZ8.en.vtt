00:00:00.143 --> 00:00:03.719
 In this video we will get to know the concept of entropy. 

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:06.923
 At first the idea of ​​entropy 

00:00:06.923 --> 00:00:08.386
 may seem a little mysterious. 

00:00:08.386 --> 00:00:11.242
 But after a couple of videos, I hope you start to understand 

00:00:11.242 --> 00:00:13.500
 on an intuitive level as it is entropy. 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.000
 Much of the definition of entropy 

00:00:17.023 --> 00:00:20.367
 revolve around the word "disorder". 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:30.720
 We can assume that entropy is the disorder of a system. 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.780
 Only with this definition in mind 

00:00:33.787 --> 00:00:36.140
 I want you to pause the video and try to compare it 

00:00:36.156 --> 00:00:38.222
 these two systems. 

00:00:38.222 --> 00:00:39.964
 I want you to compare this room with this one 

00:00:39.964 --> 00:00:43.028
 and ask yourself which one has greater entropy. 

00:00:43.028 --> 00:00:47.347
 Then I want you to compare the Moon and the Sun here. 

00:00:47.347 --> 00:00:49.158
 Obviously they are not in real scale, as the Sun 

00:00:49.158 --> 00:00:51.991
 would be much more massive and bigger, 

00:00:51.991 --> 00:00:53.315
 if the pictures were on the right scale. 

00:00:53.315 --> 00:00:55.961
 But which of these two systems is more entropy? 

00:00:55.961 --> 00:00:59.142
 Okay, I guess he's already tried. 

00:00:59.142 --> 00:01:01.998
 Looking at the two rooms, 

00:01:01.998 --> 00:01:05.087
 at first glance it seems to us that this room is arranged here. 

00:01:05.087 --> 00:01:07.246
 This is a clean room. 

00:01:07.246 --> 00:01:12.780
 And this one seems to be messy, messy. 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.340
 With this definition of entropy, you probably thought it was 

00:01:15.345 --> 00:01:16.645
 if there is more disorder in this room, 

00:01:16.645 --> 00:01:18.154
 it's probably more entropy. 

00:01:18.154 --> 00:01:20.615
 And not only do you think so. 

00:01:20.615 --> 00:01:22.241
 In fact, many textbooks use the example of a stacked and messy room. 

00:01:25.073 --> 00:01:28.626
 And the scattered room is considered a room with greater entropy. 

00:01:28.626 --> 00:01:30.646
 But it is not exactly the case. 

00:01:30.646 --> 00:01:33.130
 This "disorder" here is different 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:34.872
 from this "mess". 

00:01:34.872 --> 00:01:37.705
 I will emphasize this to make you quite clear. 

00:01:37.705 --> 00:01:43.180
 Scattered 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.660
 is not equal to entropy. 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.538
 To understand what "disorder" means in the sense of entropy, 

00:01:51.538 --> 00:01:55.531
 we will have to work a little more on how to imagine it. 

00:01:55.531 --> 00:01:56.948
 But I hope it will become clear. 

00:01:56.948 --> 00:02:02.869
 In entropy, disorder is determined by the number of states a system can accept. 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:06.460
 What do I mean under system state? 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.000
 Let's say I have a box. 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.554
 In it four molecules move in all directions. 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:23.920
 One molecule is pink, the other blue, 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:31.560
 this one here is yellow, 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.098
 and this is green. 

00:02:33.098 --> 00:02:36.674
 This is a particular situation, 

00:02:36.674 --> 00:02:38.043
 specific configuration. 

00:02:38.043 --> 00:02:40.574
 But in this system the molecules move 

00:02:40.574 --> 00:02:42.316
 and may take up other configurations. 

00:02:42.316 --> 00:02:43.779
 To take other states. 

00:02:43.779 --> 00:02:48.771
 The yellow molecule may have come here, 

00:02:48.771 --> 00:02:51.766
 blue here, 

00:02:51.766 --> 00:02:56.365
 pink may already be here, 

00:02:56.365 --> 00:03:00.845
 and the green molecule is now here. 

00:03:01.535 --> 00:03:03.935
 One system can take many different states. 

00:03:03.935 --> 00:03:05.607
 I have just painted two of the states of this system. 

00:03:05.607 --> 00:03:07.859
 But this system can have many more states. 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:10.901
 Both these configurations are specific states of this system. 

00:03:10.901 --> 00:03:15.034
 So, we have one box system 

00:03:15.034 --> 00:03:16.659
 with four molecules in it. 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.340
 Let's compare it with another system, 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.480
 where we have a bigger box 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.400
 with more molecules in the box. 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.946
 Let's say two yellow molecules, 

00:03:33.596 --> 00:03:36.790
 a blue molecule, 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.867
 a green molecule, 

00:03:39.867 --> 00:03:44.036
 here's a pink ... That's pretty fun. 

00:03:44.036 --> 00:03:47.937
 I will also paint a light-colored molecule here 

00:03:47.937 --> 00:03:51.600
 In this larger system, there are more molecule locations 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.301
 and besides, there are more molecules. 

00:03:53.301 --> 00:03:57.760
 So configurations or conditions will be more. 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.660
 I drew a state, but they can be much more. 

00:03:59.661 --> 00:04:01.937
 Imagine how molecules move constantly 

00:04:01.937 --> 00:04:05.118
 in different directions, it will become clear to us that there are many different states, 

00:04:05.118 --> 00:04:06.186
 which they can borrow. 

00:04:06.186 --> 00:04:10.500
 And without even knowing what molecules are doing at this particular moment, 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:18.520
 we can say that there are more possible states in this system, 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:28.160
 than in this system, there are fewer possible states in it. 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.220
 And because this system here has more possible states 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:33.969
 more configurations you will need 

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:37.127
 to give you more information to find out where it is. 

00:04:37.127 --> 00:04:43.600
 And for this system we can say that there is greater entropy. 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.128
 When we talk about a mess, we actually mean it 

00:04:46.128 --> 00:04:48.659
 the number of possible states of a thing. 

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:51.514
 And there is a logic, it is easy to imagine 

00:04:51.514 --> 00:04:53.627
 that there are many more things to move here, 

00:04:53.627 --> 00:04:55.276
 in many different directions 

00:04:55.276 --> 00:04:56.530
 and with much more space for movement. 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:58.364
 So this system is logical in general 

00:04:58.364 --> 00:04:59.479
 to have more entropy. 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:03.960
 When we talk about entropy, we do not mean any particular condition, 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.073
 any particular configuration. 

00:05:06.073 --> 00:05:07.977
 We are talking about the system as a whole, 

00:05:07.977 --> 00:05:11.065
 without knowing where molecules are present. 

00:05:11.065 --> 00:05:15.221
 In the room example, we talk about specific states. 

00:05:15.221 --> 00:05:19.261
 "Scattered" and "clean" are two specific states. 

00:05:19.261 --> 00:05:21.351
 But we do not mention the amount of configurations, 

00:05:21.351 --> 00:05:23.185
 which a room could have. 

00:05:23.185 --> 00:05:25.855
 In fact, if this room is larger, 

00:05:25.855 --> 00:05:30.308
 there could be more configurations. 

00:05:30.308 --> 00:05:31.823
 And at the molecular level, 

00:05:31.823 --> 00:05:34.354
 if this room is warm, and this cold ... 

00:05:34.354 --> 00:05:38.022
 or if this is simply greater, it means there are more molecules in it. 

00:05:38.022 --> 00:05:41.505
 And these molecules can be arranged in many more configurations. 

00:05:41.505 --> 00:05:45.419
 So it is possible for this room to have a higher entropy. 

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:47.718
 So, consider this justification, and let's go back 

00:05:47.718 --> 00:05:50.319
 to the comparison of the Moon and the Sun. 

00:05:50.319 --> 00:05:52.176
 Which one has higher entropy? 

00:05:52.176 --> 00:05:54.057
 Let's think. 

00:05:54.057 --> 00:05:58.794
 The sun is bigger, that is, many more molecules 

00:05:58.794 --> 00:06:01.626
 And these molecules move much faster, 

00:06:01.626 --> 00:06:03.948
 hotter and different. 

00:06:03.948 --> 00:06:09.380
 While the moon is small, cold, with fewer molecules. 

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:10.979
 For the most part, it is hard, 

00:06:10.979 --> 00:06:14.160
 there is no high temperature, which means that her molecules do not move much. 

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:18.757
 There are much less states, much less configurations than the Sun. 

00:06:18.757 --> 00:06:21.265
 If we look at the Sun as a system, 

00:06:21.265 --> 00:06:30.340
 his entropy is much greater than that of the moon. 

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:35.660
 Its entropy is much larger than the moon. 

00:06:36.258 --> 00:06:38.069
 Think about how much information would we need? 

00:06:38.069 --> 00:06:42.272
 We'll need a lot of information to find out where each molecule is located 

00:06:42.272 --> 00:06:44.524
 or any atom of the moon. 

00:06:44.524 --> 00:06:46.823
 But in the Sun we will need even more information to find out 

00:06:46.823 --> 00:06:49.144
 where each molecule is located at any given time. 

00:06:49.144 --> 00:06:53.277
 The sun is enormous, full of things moving. 

00:06:53.277 --> 00:06:55.994
 And all of these molecules are very active. 

00:06:55.994 --> 00:06:59.338
 I hope you're already beginning to understand what entropy is. 

00:06:59.338 --> 00:07:00.545
 But maybe you'll think 

00:07:00.545 --> 00:07:02.449
 "It's all very interesting, but why is it important?" 

00:07:02.449 --> 00:07:05.212
 It is important because to some extent 

00:07:05.212 --> 00:07:08.579
 we can describe the universe with the help of entropy. 

00:07:08.579 --> 00:07:12.480
 As we know from the second law of thermodynamics, 

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:15.893
 entropy in the universe is constantly growing. 

00:07:15.893 --> 00:07:18.354
 We are constantly going to the universe 

00:07:18.354 --> 00:07:20.304
 with more possible conditions 

00:07:20.304 --> 00:07:24.001
 and the consequences of this are very interesting.
