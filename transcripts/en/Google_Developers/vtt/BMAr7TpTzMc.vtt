DANIEL SIEBERG: Hi there.

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:05.160
I'm Daniel Sieberg.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.760
As we continue with our I/O Live
coverage, we are now in

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.080
the YouTube space,
and I am joined

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.990
by Jason from Flipboard.

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:14.570
Now Flipboard, as a lot of
people will know, is this,

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.910
well, you flip through your
content, whether it's news

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.130
that's been pulled for
you, social media.

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.850
It's got a very distinctive way
of interacting with it.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.490
Tell me how you're here and why
you're here with YouTube?

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:27.880
JASON CULVERHOUSE: Yes.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.020
Well, a couple reasons.

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.400
So two weeks ago, a week
ago, we released

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.040
Flipboard on Android.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.080
So we're running on the new
Nexus tablet, and the phones

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.730
and the phone form factor.

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.350
And we did integrations
with both YouTube--

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.180
so we're directly accessing
the YouTube data APIs--

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.730
and we had early access to the
writeable Google+ APIs.

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.110
So now you can interact with
that content, right on

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.310
YouTube, right on Google+, leave
comments, +1 stuff, Like

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:00.540
it, and that's why we're here.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:00.730
DANIEL SIEBERG: OK.

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:01.070
Very cool.

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.500
So you've got a demo
you can do for us.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.540
So if you do come across
a YouTube video in your

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.570
Flipboard content,
what can you do?

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.750
JASON CULVERHOUSE: Yeah.

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.410
So I'm a developer, so I do
things like here I'm following

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:11.640
the Google Developers feed.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.180
And if this is a video that I
like, I can just come right

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.430
here and I can Like it.

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.050
I could play it in our
client full screen.

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.400
And I can go and I can
see, hey, here's who

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.290
commented on it.

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.190
If I want to leave a comment,
I can do that.

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:31.430
And then we sort of do it
in our magazine format.

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.620
These are my subscriptions, so
some games and stuff, and some

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.320
developer stuff.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.540
But we can also go look at
everything else like the

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.926
popular YouTube feeds, what's
trending, what's popular.

00:01:43.926 --> 00:01:47.470
You know, trending is
always pretty good.

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:48.370
Like it.

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:51.200
Oh, if I like this video right
here, I can actually just

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:58.360
click right here, and then I
can say, share this video,

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.660
right to everybody on
my Google+ account.

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.670
And then that video is
going to be shared on

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:05.750
Google+ right now.

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.680
And we'll go look at my
feed and we'll see it.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.030
DANIEL SIEBERG: Fantastic.

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.410
So tell me about the experience
of working with the

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.190
YouTube API, any sort of
learnings or tips you want to

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.470
pass along to folks.

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.850
JASON CULVERHOUSE: Yeah.

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.160
First of all, we got a lot
of help from YouTube.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.430
We did this really quick and
so they're very responsive.

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.930
There's a new YouTube API coming
out, so it's useful.

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.685
I'd say we learned a lot,
try to be minimal

00:02:30.685 --> 00:02:33.020
in our request sizes.

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.150
We worked with YouTube
about our quotas, a

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.560
very popular app.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.030
A lot of accesses.

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.910
So they were very responsive in
helping us with resolving

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.710
quota issues and things
like that.

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:47.460
And I'll say the same thing,
the Google+ team.

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.920
Because no one really saw this
app and then we released it,

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.770
so some of the people on the
Google+ team were, like, our

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.410
best QA, because they really
went through it, and they were

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.700
the deep Google+ users.

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.805
DANIEL SIEBERG: And what's the
response been like to this

00:03:00.805 --> 00:03:01.530
since you rolled it out?

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:02.330
JASON CULVERHOUSE:
It's really good.

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.270
Just standing here, everybody
comes by, they

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:05.860
say, love it, great.

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.720
Of course the most frequent
request is, can we get it on

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.400
the tablet form factor?

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.380
And right now we're pretty much
the phone form factor,

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.830
but it will run on a Android
tablet in that form factor.

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.230
But it's been really
positive response.

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.600
I think you could see the
downloads on the graph, and we

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.430
got a great rating on the
Google Play Store, so

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:29.600
it's all been good.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.350
DANIEL SIEBERG: What's the
future of this, do you think,

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:32.020
for you guys?

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:33.840
Any sort of iterations
coming down the pipe?

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.220
JASON CULVERHOUSE: Yeah, I think
there's always lots of

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.090
stuff, better UI, more
responsive, we

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.010
always like to be faster.

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.560
And working with Google to
refine some APIs, because we

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.050
have a very specific usage.

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:51.170
So I think all that just leads
to a better user experience.

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.490
DANIEL SIEBERG: Cool.

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:52.460
Jason, thank you so much.

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:53.520
We're going to flip
on out of here.

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.710
JASON CULVERHOUSE: All right.

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:54.160
Thank you.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.612
DANIEL SIEBERG: All right.

00:03:54.612 --> 00:03:55.970
Appreciate it.

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:56.150
All right.

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.000
We're joined now by Alex, who
is the creator of Code Hero.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.100
I am not even going to pretend
to be an expert at code, so I

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:05.645
think this might be something
that would work well for me.

00:04:05.645 --> 00:04:05.970
ALEX PEAKE: Yeah.

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.230
DANIEL SIEBERG: Help me
understand, what is

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:08.070
Code Hero all about?

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.670
ALEX PEAKE: So yeah.

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.340
Code Hero is a game that teaches
you how to make games.

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:12.370
Do you like games?

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.880
DANIEL SIEBERG: Love games.

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.550
ALEX PEAKE: Do you want
to learn code?

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:15.480
DANIEL SIEBERG: Do want
to learn code.

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:15.750
ALEX PEAKE: Check.

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:16.680
So you're the target audience.

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:17.160
DANIEL SIEBERG: OK.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.120
ALEX PEAKE: So we've been
asked, who's it for?

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.450
Like, middle school is like the
classic group that's going

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.440
to most get into games and
learning programming, but

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.410
everybody's welcome.

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.850
The magic thing about this
is it's actually a game.

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:30.210
It's not like an easier way to
learn programming that's

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.760
actually secretly tutorials
with lots of reading.

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:33.890
So it looks like a game.

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:34.560
It is a game.

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.010
And you hit, of all, buttons,
New Game, and you're in it.

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:40.720
And what's awesome about this
is that you're being

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.010
orientated from the very
beginning in a

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:44.200
first person world.

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.480
DANIEL SIEBERG: [INAUDIBLE]
gaming environment.

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.920
ALEX PEAKE: Right.

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.170
So it's kind of like Tron,
but backwards.

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:49.290
If we made everything dark,
it'd be a little

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:50.790
scary to some kids.

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:55.100
And you pick up these magic
glasses, and it says, type,

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.080
click hello world, and
copy that code.

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.080
And then when you shoot the
code, it executes, and you go

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.140
to the next challenge.

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:02.030
And the next one is
change the code.

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:05.030
So up until now you just copied
the code, but now we

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:06.250
have to type it in.

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:09.550
And so the essence of this is
to walk people step-by-step

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:11.400
through each challenge.

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.360
So now they're probably
thinking, OK, is this just a

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.430
bunch of text?

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:16.030
The key is to show programming
is fun.

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:17.620
So this is some blocks,
and there's a target.

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.410
And it says, just push
the blocks, but

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:20.600
you'll have to add zeros.

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.740
So this code here
says, add force,

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.760
transform forward 100,000.

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.020
That sounds like a lot, but in
the world of physics that's

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:28.560
actually not enough force,
and the cubes

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.130
are just not impressed.

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:34.360
But if we add zeros, you realize
code is power and you

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:35.850
can blast these blocks apart.

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:38.270
And you can get that very
quickly in programming, you'll

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:40.740
be able to get the gold star
and accomplish things.

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.990
As long as you don't get eaten
by the poison laser lava

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:46.020
safety sharks.

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:46.450
DANIEL SIEBERG: Doctor
Evil would approve.

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:47.000
ALEX PEAKE: Yeah.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.870
And so the integration that we
did with YouTube was based on

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:53.460
the fact that people that are
learning programming are

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:55.030
really going to be proud of what
they're accomplishing,

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:57.270
and they'll want to show
off to their friends.

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:00.390
And especially since the goal
of Code Hero is to make your

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:02.080
own game, to produce
a video game.

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.180
That's the first thing you do.

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:05.480
You want to share that game.

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:09.720
And so a long time ago I
thought, wouldn't it be great

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.960
if I could upload directly
to YouTube what

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:12.820
the player is doing?

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:14.030
And they wouldn't have to
do that themselves.

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:15.540
And I saw Black Ops
was doing it.

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:16.400
There's tons of videos--

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:17.090
Call of Duty.

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:19.960
Mind Craft had people building
computers and uploading them.

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:23.580
So we implemented at a hackathon
in three days, the

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:26.010
Unity YouTube API,
which wasn't for

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:27.420
Unity, it was just Mono.

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:31.230
All we did was download the
Mono DLL and compile it in

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:32.190
MonoDevelop.

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:34.500
And I made this little cube
where, when you touch this

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.590
cube, you won't really
see much happening.

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:38.080
But it's saying add
frame, add frame.

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:40.670
It's recording live video
from the game.

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:42.710
So you'd be able to show people
anything you can learn

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:44.185
in the game, and then they
can learn too, or

00:06:44.185 --> 00:06:45.290
anything you can create.

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:47.970
And the end result is, it just
says upload completed.

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:51.910
And this is the first video we
ever uploaded on stage, sort

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:56.180
of crossing our fingers, and
it worked the first time we

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:56.680
ever tried it.

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.000
DANIEL SIEBERG: And that's
only four seconds, but of

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.445
course it can be much
longer than that.

00:06:59.445 --> 00:06:59.770
ALEX PEAKE: Yes.

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:03.840
So the API for YouTube in a
game makes a lot of sense,

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.720
because when you learn how
to make a game, you

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:06.580
want to show it off.

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:08.330
When you learn anything, or do
anything cool, you want to

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:09.190
show it off.

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:11.110
And because people are learning
make games with

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:14.360
Unity, they're going to want
this plug-in, which we made,

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:16.500
which is called Unity CapTube.

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:18.420
Sort of like Unity Capture
but with a B.

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:22.550
And Unity CapTube just plugs
into any Unity-based game.

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:24.590
Which is what Code Hero's
teaching them, is the Unity

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:28.180
game engine, which is the most
popular game engine.

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:31.910
You can plug those games into
your Android device, your

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:34.720
web-based games, anything,
native client.

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:37.150
And to be able to upload videos
straight to YouTube

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:39.060
means that your game is going
to spread faster, and more

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:40.180
people are going to see it.

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:41.260
So that's Code Hero.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:42.420
DANIEL SIEBERG: Help your
game go viral, or

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:42.660
something in the sense.

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:43.260
ALEX PEAKE: Yes.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:44.930
And hopefully help programming
go viral.

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:45.330
DANIEL SIEBERG: Right.

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:46.670
ALEX PEAKE: You know,
we live in an era

00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:48.480
where code is literacy.

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:52.120
English might be our first
language, but we're kind of

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:56.360
like Romans, like, adapting to
English, or we have to get

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:58.130
with the times and learn
programming.

00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:00.120
So it's time for programming
to go viral.

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:00.440
DANIEL SIEBERG: That's
fantastic.

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:03.490
When can people get their hands
on this, if they want to

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:04.620
check out Code Hero
in a bigger way?

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:06.370
ALEX PEAKE: So what we did
a big Kickstarter.

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:08.910
We raised $170,000,
which was great.

00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:10.640
And we're going to be launching
in September the

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:12.790
final version of, like,
the first complete

00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:13.860
version of the game.

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:15.260
But you can get it
now if you want.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.910
You can go to the website
at codehero.org.

00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:19.900
That's codehero.org.

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:22.120
And if you just buy the game
for whatever donation you

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:24.160
want, just like the Kickstarter
backers, you can

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:27.230
get the same pledge rewards,
like t-shirts and stuff, and

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:29.190
get the game, an early
version, and

00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:29.870
try it right away.

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:31.830
DANIEL SIEBERG: This is such a
fantastic idea, I have to say.

00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:32.340
This is great.

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:33.799
I wish you all the
best with it.

00:08:33.799 --> 00:08:34.020
ALEX PEAKE: Thanks.

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:34.690
DANIEL SIEBERG: Thank
you so much, Alex.

00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:36.200
And maybe one day I'll
be a Code Hero, too.

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:36.490
ALEX PEAKE: Thanks.

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:38.970
And thanks for making the
YouTube API awesome.

00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:40.220
Our pleasure.

00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:43.960
This is seriously really--

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:47.790
The last stop in our tour of the
YouTube booth is with the

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:49.420
guys from Parrot.

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:52.940
And we're talking about
the AR Drone 2.0.

00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:55.470
The AR Drone's been around for a
little while, and the reason

00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:58.170
that you're here is to talk
about the tie-in with YouTube,

00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:02.130
of course, but walk us through
what the AR Drone is capable

00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:02.980
of doing first.

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:03.830
PIERRE BUREAU: OK.

00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:07.050
So the AR Drone is a flying
device that you can control

00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:11.050
from a smartphone or a tablet
running Android or iOS.

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:14.520
And it's embedding a camera.

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:18.020
So well, what's new with the 2.0
version is that you have a

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:22.190
HD camera to record
your videos.

00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:25.650
And so it has a lot of sensors,
it's a really smart

00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:27.580
device, so it can stabilize
by itself.

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:29.760
Basically that stuff, it's
flying by itself.

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:33.600
So all you got to do is you
press a button, it takes off,

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:36.830
and then it stabilizes
right there.

00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:41.680
And in the new version of the
app, we have integrated the

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:45.210
possibility to record and manage
your media, so photos

00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:46.150
and videos.

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:49.150
And you can share them online
directly from the app.

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:50.030
DANIEL SIEBERG: Because
that's really cool.

00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:52.730
I mean the ability to fly it
in some neat location, and

00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:54.650
then share that with everybody
through YouTube, right?

00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:55.830
PIERRE BUREAU: Exactly.

00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:56.530
Through YouTube.

00:09:56.530 --> 00:10:01.940
So everybody can see where your
flights are, what cool

00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:06.660
things you have seen, and
you can share that

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:07.690
with the world, basically.

00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:09.870
DANIEL SIEBERG: Now, there's a
tie-in with Google TV, that

00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:11.100
maybe we should mention
as well?

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:11.390
PIERRE BUREAU: Yeah.

00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:15.200
So we just finished an
integration on the new Google

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:18.010
TV, that's also running
Android.

00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:23.260
So you can have the video stream
from the drone directly

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:26.030
on your TV, and control
the drone with

00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:27.850
the Google TV remote.

00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:30.840
DANIEL SIEBERG: So what was it
like working with the YouTube

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:32.900
folks to put all of
this together?

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:34.650
Maybe some learnings you
can offer to the other

00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:35.610
developers out there?

00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:38.280
PIERRE BUREAU: That was
actually very easy.

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:42.810
The integration of the YouTube
sharing mechanism was very

00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:48.120
straightforward, both on
the iOS and Android.

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:53.610
So actually I don't have a lot
of things to say about

00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:56.320
possible problems, because
we didn't have any.

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:59.350
And what we're doing is
still quite basic.

00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:02.260
We're only doing
online sharing.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:06.210
Later on, maybe, we'd like to
work with some editing, adding

00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:07.930
some music, things like that.

00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:11.180
This is still some work in
progress, and we'll use the

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:12.780
YouTube APIs to do that.

00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:14.500
DANIEL SIEBERG: Can you tell
me about some of the more

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:16.630
unusual or unique places
that people have

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:20.050
flown their AR Drones?

00:11:20.050 --> 00:11:23.480
PIERRE BUREAU: We have users
that have posted videos from

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:24.460
all over the world.

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:24.845
DANIEL SIEBERG: Really?

00:11:24.845 --> 00:11:25.620
OK.

00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:28.730
PIERRE BUREAU: So we have videos
from the Grand Canyon

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:34.090
in the US, some fjords
in northern Europe.

00:11:34.090 --> 00:11:36.070
So really, everywhere.

00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:37.050
DANIEL SIEBERG: People
get pretty creative.

00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:38.665
PIERRE BUREAU: Yes, they can
get pretty creative,

00:11:38.665 --> 00:11:39.570
definitely.

00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:41.450
DANIEL SIEBERG: What's
next for--

00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:43.050
can you tell us anything
about the next

00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:44.140
version of the AR Drone?

00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:46.520
PIERRE BUREAU: Well, I can tell
you that we are already

00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:48.190
working on the next
generations.

00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:51.130
They're not coming out soon.

00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:53.970
This has just been released
a couple of weeks ago.

00:11:53.970 --> 00:11:58.620
So we have maybe one year, one
year and a half development

00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:01.130
time before we can release
a new one.

00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:04.160
But we are working on better
videos, better video

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:08.420
capabilities, higher
definitions, things like that.

00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:09.380
DANIEL SIEBERG: And tell me
about that camera again.

00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:10.650
It was an HD camera
that's on this?

00:12:10.650 --> 00:12:10.860
PIERRE BUREAU: Yes.

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:12.790
It's HD camera, 720p camera.

00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:13.260
DANIEL SIEBERG: OK.

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:16.890
PIERRE BUREAU: And you can
record your videos through the

00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:20.900
Wi-Fi link, or you can plug your
own USB stick inside the

00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:23.990
drone so that you have the
perfect quality all the time.

00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:25.100
DANIEL SIEBERG: And then when
you want to share it on

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:26.750
YouTube, you do it
through the app?

00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:28.270
PIERRE BUREAU: You're doing
it through the app.

00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:28.560
Yeah.

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:30.050
So--

00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:31.770
DANIEL SIEBERG: How long can
the video clips be that you

00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:33.010
want to share through?

00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:34.340
PIERRE BUREAU: The
video can be--

00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:35.480
DANIEL SIEBERG: As long as the
memory gets [INAUDIBLE]?

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:36.850
PIERRE BUREAU: Yeah, as
long as the memory is.

00:12:36.850 --> 00:12:38.150
So you can fly for 10 minutes.

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:42.260
10, 12 minutes, so that's
longest video you can make.

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:42.700
DANIEL SIEBERG: OK.

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:44.290
Well, I think maybe we should
pause here and get a little

00:12:44.290 --> 00:12:45.050
demo, what do you think?

00:12:45.050 --> 00:12:45.820
PIERRE BUREAU: Yes,
that's good.

00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:46.130
DANIEL SIEBERG: All right.

00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:47.045
Pierre, thank you so much.

00:12:47.045 --> 00:12:47.320
I appreciate it.

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:47.750
PIERRE BUREAU: Thank you.

00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:49.000
DANIEL SIEBERG: All right.
