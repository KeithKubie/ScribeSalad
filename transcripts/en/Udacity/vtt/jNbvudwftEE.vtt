What if you don't have the graph but

00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:03.170
you know the slope and
y-intercept of the line?

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:04.567
Can you find the equation then?

00:00:04.567 --> 00:00:08.487
Can you tell me what's the equation
of the line with the slope 4 and

00:00:08.487 --> 00:00:10.457
