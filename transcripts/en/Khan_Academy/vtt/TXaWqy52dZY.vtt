00:00:01.214 --> 00:00:02.756
- [Voiceover] Multiplying by 10 creates

00:00:02.756 --> 00:00:05.130
a really neat pattern with numbers,

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:06.471
so let's try a few out and see

00:00:06.471 --> 00:00:07.975
if we can discover the pattern.

00:00:07.975 --> 00:00:09.897
Let's try to figure it out.

00:00:09.897 --> 00:00:11.813
We'll start with one that
maybe we already know,

00:00:11.813 --> 00:00:15.146
let's start something like two times 10.

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.068
And maybe we know the
solution but let's think about

00:00:19.068 --> 00:00:20.404
more than just the solution,

00:00:20.404 --> 00:00:22.153
let's think about what it really means

00:00:22.153 --> 00:00:24.533
to multiply two times 10.

00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:27.450
Two times 10 means we have two 10s.

00:00:29.836 --> 00:00:32.669
Or, we have a 10, plus another 10.

00:00:34.791 --> 00:00:38.958
Which is equal 10 plus
another 10, is equal to 20.

00:00:41.756 --> 00:00:44.376
And again, maybe we didn't
need this middle part,

00:00:44.376 --> 00:00:46.553
maybe we already knew two times 10 is 20,

00:00:46.553 --> 00:00:49.177
but it'll be helpful to think about what

00:00:49.177 --> 00:00:50.887
two times 10 means because it will help us

00:00:50.887 --> 00:00:54.271
when we get to much trickier ones.

00:00:54.271 --> 00:00:56.560
Let's try one that's maybe
just a little bit trickier,

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.560
let's try five times 10.

00:01:00.603 --> 00:01:03.770
Five times 10 is going to be five 10s,

00:01:06.779 --> 00:01:10.279
or, one 10 plus another 10 plus a third 10

00:01:11.691 --> 00:01:15.858
plus a fourth 10 plus a fifth
10, so we have five 10s,

00:01:16.959 --> 00:01:20.292
we have one, two, three, four, five 10s.

00:01:21.401 --> 00:01:23.991
And we can solve that, we
can add those together,

00:01:23.991 --> 00:01:25.574
10, 20, 30, 40, 50.

00:01:29.967 --> 00:01:32.300
So our solution here, is 50.

00:01:35.211 --> 00:01:38.461
Five 10s is 50, or five times 10 is 50.

00:01:39.945 --> 00:01:42.030
Let's go to one more, maybe
one that we don't know

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.662
the answer to off the top of our head,

00:01:43.662 --> 00:01:46.745
let's try something like 13 times 10.

00:01:48.131 --> 00:01:50.463
Maybe we don't know the
answer to 13 times 10

00:01:50.463 --> 00:01:53.963
but we do know that 13 times 10 is 13 10s.

00:01:56.216 --> 00:01:58.305
And we can count 13 tens.

00:01:58.305 --> 00:02:02.770
We have a 10, plus another 10,
plus another, there's three,

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.437
four, five, six 10s,
seven, eight, nine, 10,

00:02:12.722 --> 00:02:15.639
we're almost there, 11 10s, 12 10s,

00:02:16.893 --> 00:02:18.806
and finally a thirteenth 10.

00:02:18.806 --> 00:02:20.389
Let's count to make sure.

00:02:20.389 --> 00:02:24.520
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, 10,

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.020
11, 12, 13, great.

00:02:27.602 --> 00:02:30.161
So we have 13 10s, so let's count those,

00:02:30.161 --> 00:02:31.669
let's see how much that is.

00:02:31.669 --> 00:02:34.919
We have 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80,

00:02:38.756 --> 00:02:40.673
90, 100, 110, 120, 130.

00:02:44.431 --> 00:02:46.348
So our solution is 130.

00:02:49.493 --> 00:02:51.628
I think we can pause
here and look at the ones

00:02:51.628 --> 00:02:55.296
we've done so far and see if
we can figure out this pattern.

00:02:55.296 --> 00:02:58.463
Two times 10 is 20, five times 10, 50,

00:03:00.636 --> 00:03:02.053
13 times 10, 130.

00:03:04.134 --> 00:03:08.301
In every case we took the
number that we started with,

00:03:09.723 --> 00:03:11.896
and we kept that, that
was part of our answer,

00:03:11.896 --> 00:03:13.524
and then we added one new thing,

00:03:13.524 --> 00:03:16.237
which was a zero at the end.

00:03:16.237 --> 00:03:18.995
Any time we multiply a whole number by 10

00:03:18.995 --> 00:03:21.804
we're gonna keep the original number

00:03:21.804 --> 00:03:25.060
and simply add a zero to the end.

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.834
So let's try some without
all this middle stuff.

00:03:28.834 --> 00:03:33.001
What if we had something
like, a little bit tougher,

00:03:35.834 --> 00:03:37.751
maybe like 49 times 10.

00:03:41.095 --> 00:03:43.611
Well 49 times 10, you may guess is,

00:03:43.611 --> 00:03:47.444
is gonna be a 49 with
what at the end, a zero.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.283
Or 490, because this would be 49 10s,

00:03:54.585 --> 00:03:58.335
and if we counted 49
10s we would get to 490.

00:04:00.305 --> 00:04:01.976
Let's go even tougher than that.

00:04:01.976 --> 00:04:05.559
What if we had something
like 723 times 10?

00:04:09.764 --> 00:04:12.810
Well our solution, and
maybe you've guessed it,

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.310
is going to be 723 with a zero on the end,

00:04:18.791 --> 00:04:21.291
or, 7000 200 and 30 is the way

00:04:22.973 --> 00:04:24.808
we would actually read that answer.

00:04:24.808 --> 00:04:28.280
But looking at it, it quite
simply is the original number,

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.613
723, with a zero on the end.

00:04:33.805 --> 00:04:35.931
Let's take this one step
further and let's think about it

00:04:35.931 --> 00:04:37.147
in terms of place value.

00:04:37.147 --> 00:04:39.455
Let's think about what
multiplying by 10 did

00:04:39.455 --> 00:04:43.455
to these numbers in terms
of their place values.

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:46.856
So here we have a place value chart,

00:04:46.856 --> 00:04:48.861
and let's start back with one
of the simpler ones we did,

00:04:48.861 --> 00:04:50.275
like two.

00:04:50.275 --> 00:04:51.608
Two is two ones.

00:04:54.708 --> 00:04:57.635
And when we multiply that two times 10,

00:04:57.635 --> 00:05:00.218
the two moved up a place value.

00:05:02.815 --> 00:05:05.153
And then we had to fill
in this empty place value

00:05:05.153 --> 00:05:06.778
with a zero.

00:05:06.778 --> 00:05:10.974
So two times 10 was 20,
and what happened in terms

00:05:10.974 --> 00:05:13.698
of place value, was the two
moved up one place value,

00:05:13.698 --> 00:05:15.865
it went from ones to tens,

00:05:17.111 --> 00:05:20.574
it moved to the left one place value.

00:05:20.574 --> 00:05:24.419
Let's look at another one,
maybe one of the tougher ones,

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:26.002
something like 723.

00:05:29.469 --> 00:05:31.969
When we multiply 723 times 10,

00:05:33.226 --> 00:05:35.396
we multiplied this one times 10,

00:05:35.396 --> 00:05:38.569
the seven moved one
place value to the left

00:05:38.569 --> 00:05:43.151
to the thousands, the two
moved up to the hundreds,

00:05:43.151 --> 00:05:45.608
and the three moved up to the tens.

00:05:45.608 --> 00:05:48.479
And then again, we simply added a zero

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:50.816
in the empty place value in the end.

00:05:50.816 --> 00:05:54.504
So multiplying by 10, one
way to describe the pattern,

00:05:54.504 --> 00:05:58.030
is that it adds a zero to
the end of a whole number.

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:00.323
But another way to describe the pattern,

00:06:00.323 --> 00:06:04.333
is that it moves every
place value, every number,

00:06:04.333 --> 00:06:06.666
one place value to the left.

00:06:08.084 --> 00:06:10.294
So if we tried one looking at it this way,

00:06:10.294 --> 00:06:14.461
let's say we tried something
like, 20, let's do 27.

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:22.460
If we multiply 27 times 10,

00:06:23.787 --> 00:06:27.089
well the two's gonna move
one place value over,

00:06:27.089 --> 00:06:29.052
so it will now be in the hundreds,

00:06:29.052 --> 00:06:31.896
and the seven's gonna
move over a place value,

00:06:31.896 --> 00:06:34.143
so it will be in the tens,

00:06:34.143 --> 00:06:35.485
and then we'll have to fill in

00:06:35.485 --> 00:06:37.948
that empty place value with a zero.

00:06:37.948 --> 00:06:41.865
So we can say that 27
times 10 is equal to 270.

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:50.123
So whether we think about
it as adding the zero

00:06:50.123 --> 00:06:52.873
to the end or moving the
place value to the left,

00:06:52.873 --> 00:06:55.807
multiplying by 10 creates
a really neat pattern,

00:06:55.807 --> 00:06:59.859
that we can use to help us
to solve these problems.
