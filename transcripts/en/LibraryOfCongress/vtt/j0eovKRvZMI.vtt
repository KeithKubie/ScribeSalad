00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:07.010
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:08.310
&gt;&gt; Robert Newlen: Our line

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:11.210
up of distinguished authors
will discuss a whole range

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:15.060
of topics related to
life in the 21st century.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:18.780
And I want to just
mention these authors

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:20.780
because it's just a
distinguished line up.

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:23.860
It's just really for the
National Book Festival,

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.800
an Embarrassment of Riches.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.990
We have Angela J. Davis.

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.510
Yes.

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:35.450
[ Applause ]

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.510
Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor.

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.270
[ Applause ]

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.510
Jabari Asim--

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.760
[ Applause ]

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.120
-- who is quickly finishing
his email before the talk.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.630
Just kidding.

00:00:53.630 --> 00:01:00.330
Anne-Marie Slaughter, Alejandro
Danois, James McBride, Dian Rehm,

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.890
Suzanne Jacoby and Jeffrey
Toobin, so they're all going

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:05.190
to be appearing here today.

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.140 position:56%
And I hope you will get to see them.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.520
Also I want to make special notice
of one author, Jo Ann Jenkins,

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.970
who is the current CEO of the
AARP and a former senior manager

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.780
at the Library of Congress.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.350
Jo Ann and AARP are
long time supporters

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.230
of the National Book Festival.

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:29.750
And I really want to extend
my gratitude to her and AARP

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.490
for their continued support.

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.980
I think she'll enjoy her
talk about disruptive aging.

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:39.120
I've turned 63 in just
a couple more months.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.890
And I've heard Jo Ann speak.

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.650
And a lot of the things
she was talking

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:44.400
about really rang through for me.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.140
So I hope you get to see her.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.370
But it's now my pleasure to
tell you about today's program,

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:56.110
which is a panel discussion
about contemporary issues

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.100
in African-American lives.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.660
It is my pleasure to introduce
the first of three panelists

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:06.990
for this discussion, Jabari Asim,
who is an author, poet, playwright

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.130
and associate professor of
writing literature and publishing

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.520
at Emerson College in
Boston Massachusetts

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.670
where he directs the MFA
Creative Writing Program.

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.840
He's also the executive
editor of the crisis.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.550
Please welcome Jabari Asim
and our panelists today.

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.510
And thank you so much.

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:35.640
[ Applause ]

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.130
&gt;&gt; Jabari Asim: Thank you, Robert.

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.810
Good afternoon.

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.670
I like to welcome you
to this discussion.

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.730
As Robert says the first
to take place today

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.500
on a temporary life stage here

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.740
at the National Book Festival
is my great privilege to be

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:53.310
in conversation with two insightful
authors whose work has obvious

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.980
developments to many of
the events taking place

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.640
in the country at this time.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.410
We convene following the police
killings of Terence Crutcher,

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:07.260 position:56%
Keith Lamont Scott, which follows so
many similar deaths of women and men

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.740
of color across the nation.

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.770
They are events that have prompted
many cannot only question the

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:15.840
justice system but also the words

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.460
of the great Fannie Lou
Hamer to question America.

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:23.070
I'll keep the introduction
short because you can read more

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:27.120
in the festival brochure, but
with me is Angela J. Davis,

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.320
professor of law at American
University, Washington College

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.570
of Law and the author
of "Arbitrary Justice;

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.910
The Power of the American
Prosecutor."

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.530
She's an expert in
criminal law and procedure

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.610
and researches prosecutorial
power and racism

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:43.540
in the criminal justice system.

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.370
Her forthcoming book, "Policing
the Black Man" will be available

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.880
Pantheon next year.

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.730
We're joined by Keeanga-Yamahtta
Taylor, an assistant professor

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.310
in Princeton University Center
for African-American studies.

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.750
Her research often examines
race and public policy.

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:05.340
Her book from Black Lives Matter to
Black Liberation is an examination

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.070
of history, politics
and the development

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:11.430
of the social movement Black
Lives Matter in response

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.750
to police violence
in the United States.

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.930
We're going to talk a little bit
among ourselves before welcoming

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:20.330
questions from the audience
later in the product.

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:23.930
We don't have a lot of
time, so I'll dive right in.

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.370
Keeanga, thank you for your book.

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:32.000
There was as a-ha moment for me
on nearly every page especially

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.940
when you encourage me to
think about connections

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.860
between local developments and
national movements and to think

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.510
about contemporary
moments within the context

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.440
of a much longer historical
structure.

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.470
You've written that when your
publisher first encouraged you

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:46.770
to write this book.

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:48.300
You declined.

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.570
I'm very glad that
you eventually agreed,

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:55.850
but I'm curious why
you hesitated at first.

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:59.430
&gt;&gt; Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor: There
were probably two main reasons.

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:03.050
One is I had just moved
across the country

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.800
from Chicago to Philadelphia.

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.870
I teach at Princeton University.

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:14.880
And, you know, it was a fairly
significant transition for me.

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:19.220
And I felt like I was trying to
get acclimated to a new place,

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:25.390
a new situation and didn't have
time to write a book especially

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:27.510
because I was supposed to
be writing another book,

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.370
the book that I'm writing now.

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:34.290
So-- And then the second one
is probably more relevant,

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:39.160
which is that it's difficult
to write about something

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.160
that is unfolding that
you're in the midst

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:46.150
of to essentially write
about a moving target.

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:53.800
And so, I-- my reluctance was
because things seem to be changing

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:57.880
so rapidly because we had
already gone from a movement--

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:02.490
a local movement tightly
bound to events and Ferguson

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:07.830
from August 2014 until December.

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:13.210
And in December of 2014, I don't
know if people will remember,

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:17.460
we really went from a
locally focused struggle

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:24.250
to have a police officer indicted
in Ferguson to a national movement

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:29.510
that was sort of propelled
by then the killing of young,

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:33.910
Tamir Rice in Cleveland,
Tanisha Anderson in Cleveland,

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:38.560
I think a couple of weeks
before Tamir Rice was killed.

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.940
And then Eric Garner,
who hundreds of thousands

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:45.360
of people had seen choked to death

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:51.540 position:56%
by New York City police officers the
month before Mike Brown was killed.

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:53.520
In Ferguson the officer

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:59.950
who ultimately killed Eric
Garner was also not indicted,

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:02.880 position:56%
somewhere the beginning of December.

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:09.360
And so, it all of a sudden
turned into a national phenomenon

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:14.000
with marches and demonstrations
across the country.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:21.180
And so, I had so many things
in my head that I wanted to--

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:23.590
I was thinking about
that I wanted to say

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:29.470
that I essentially took
a weekend to decide

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:32.670
if I could actually write the book.

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:41.030
And I sat down at a coffee shop and
I think I wrote eight or 9000 words

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:45.080
in four or five hours,
all of which I could use.

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:48.930
And so that was like
I have things to say.

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:51.100
I can write this book.

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:52.870
And so I did.

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:54.690
&gt;&gt; Jabari Asim: I was glad you did.

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:58.430
Angela you served many
years as a public defender,

00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:02.790
how much do that direct experience
figure into this book as well

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:05.610
as the book you're working
on, "Policing the Black Man."

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:08.790
And I also wonder if you might
comment on what Keeanga talked

00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:11.170
about trying to almost keep
pace with the headlines

00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:12.470
as you work on something like that.

00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:13.770
&gt;&gt; Angela J. Davis: Yes.

00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:15.070
Yes absolutely.

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:17.540
Well, my years at the DC Public
Defender Service had everything

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:20.160
to do with that book
because I worked

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:23.240
at the DC Public Defender
Service for a dozen years.

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:27.460
And one of the things that
there were a lot of things

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:29.070
that trouble me because, you know,

00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:31.200
it's all about the criminal
justice system and its flaws,

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:35.270
but the thing that troubled me
the most was this incredible power

00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:36.980
and discretion that
prosecutors have.

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:40.300
I saw them doing all kinds
of things that were--

00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:41.690
if they didn't qualify

00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:44.930
as prosecutorial misconduct,
they were unfair.

00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:48.310
They created results
that were simply unfair,

00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:50.450
people similarly situation people,

00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:55.410 position:56%
people who committed the same crimes
allegedly being treated differently.

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:58.750
And the difference seemed
to be race and/or class.

00:08:58.750 --> 00:09:00.880
And they were held
accountable for it.

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:03.380
It didn't seem to be a mechanism
for holding them accountable.

00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:05.860
And I-- didn't seem right,
we're in a democracy, right?

00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:08.410
We hold those accountable
to whom we grant power.

00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:10.840
And these were the most
powerful individuals

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:12.140
in the criminal justice system.

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:14.410
And I just thought how can this be?

00:09:14.410 --> 00:09:17.720
So when I did join the academy,
I started researching it,

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:20.850
writing articles and then
finally thought, I get more to say

00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:24.210
about this, you know, and
wanted to do this book.

00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:26.610
So it had every influence on me.

00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:31.210
And as far as I can so relate to
what Keeanga is saying about trying

00:09:31.210 --> 00:09:33.490
to keep up with the headlines
in terms of the book I'm working

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:36.100
on now, which is an anthology.

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:38.740
I have a number of
contributing editors,

00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:40.490
but it's about policing
the black man.

00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:44.580
Of course, it came out of these
killings of unarmed black men

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:47.270
and women throughout the country.

00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:51.830
And, you know, we'll never
finish writing that book it seems

00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:54.730
because every single day
there's another killing.

00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:58.300
And it's just unfathomable.

00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:01.170
&gt;&gt; Jabari Asim: So your description
of there being different punishment

00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:05.480
for different types of defendants
makes me think about your book

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:07.940
in which you use the phase
double standard of justice

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:12.440
in which you deliberately eco
the Kerner Commission's language.

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:16.290
This notion of a double standard
of justice challenges our tendency

00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:20.820
to think of law and order
is something inherently good

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:23.550
or designed in our best interest.

00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:26.370
Could you tell us more about
the meaning of double standard

00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:30.240
of justice as you see it?

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:31.540
&gt;&gt; Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor: Sure.

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:34.840
I think the main thing
that I wanted to--

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:37.900
well, there are two things I
wanted to draw attention to,

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:43.300
one is I use the phrase
from the Kerner Commission,

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:45.090
which people don't know.

00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:54.700 position:56%
In the aftermath of the uprisings
in the 1960s from 1963 at Birmingham

00:10:54.700 --> 00:11:00.540
to the rebellions after the
assassination of Martin Luther King

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:10.660
in April of 1968, actually
prior to the king uprisings,

00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:15.230 position:56%
Lyndon Johnson had paneled a
commission to investigate the causes

00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:21.870
of the rebellions, which, you know,
fairly significant but involved

00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:25.900
over 500,000 African-Americans
and more than more

00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:28.670
than 200 cities in
the United States.

00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:33.520
And so, they came up with
a list several factors

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:37.060 position:56%
that contributed to these uprisings.

00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:40.960
And one of them had to
do with police brutality.

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:44.810
And they referred to the
double standard of justice.

00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:48.310
Meaning essentially that there is--

00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:53.470
appears to be one standard of
justice for one group of people

00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:57.110
in the United States and
then a separate standard

00:11:57.110 --> 00:12:02.540 position:56%
for African-Americans in particular,
though you could talk about the ways

00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:08.920
in which non white people seem
to get treated differently,

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:12.330
consistently throughout the
American criminal justice system.

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:17.500
And so, some of these involve just
looking at disparities, you know,

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:21.600 position:56%
you look at the number of black
people in the US, which is somewhere

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:27.220 position:56%
between 12 and 13% of the
population and yet black people make

00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:29.850
up almost half of the
people in prison,

00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:33.230
almost half of the
people on death row.

00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:35.980
In every sort of category
that you go

00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:38.370
through through the
criminal justice system,

00:12:38.370 --> 00:12:43.090
there is a grotesque
overrepresentation of black people

00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:45.400
in the criminal justice system.

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:52.000
And so I wanted to draw attention
to that for obvious reasons

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.340
in the context of the emergence of
this Black Lives Matter movement

00:12:57.340 --> 00:12:59.650
and investigate why that is.

00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:06.620
Why is there-- this
almost unbroken continuity

00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:12.780 position:56%
of racial discriminatory
approaches to policing from the time

00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:14.350
of emancipation

00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:17.590
for African-Americans
to the current moment?

00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:22.510
And so there were many
things that I say about that,

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:27.410
which cause into question the
entire institution of policing is

00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:31.710
to whether or not it's actually
about policing and ending crime

00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:34.880
or whether or not it's
about something else

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:38.040
that has absolutely
nothing to do with crime.

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:40.880
And just, you know, as one
example of that, you look at a city

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:46.530 position:56%
like Chicago, which is obviously
struggling quite a bit with violence

00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:50.650
and crime that has been
highlighted in the mass media.

00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:54.580
But if you just look at two
things that have transpired

00:13:54.580 --> 00:14:00.280 position:56%
in the last three months in Chicago,
they have fired 1000 teachers

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:02.800
and two days ago, Rahm
Emanuel pledged

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:06.130
to hire 1000 police officers.

00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:07.540
When it came to teachers,

00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:11.570 position:56%
we were told that oh there's a
budget crisis, we can't afford this,

00:14:11.570 --> 00:14:14.550
you know, put 40 kids in a
classroom, do whatever you have

00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:16.570
to do to make the situation work.

00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:18.690
When it comes to hiring
police officers,

00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:23.290
which will cost a $135 million, the
Mayor has said that he will turn

00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:28.630
over every stone to come up with
money necessary to hire the police.

00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:31.950
And so we have to put those
to realities together.

00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:35.920
And when they don't fit together,
we have to ask is policing really

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:40.550
about protecting and
preserving law and order

00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:44.340
or is it about something else?

00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:48.680
And what is it that
something else that I'm--

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:54.500
I think is important to talk
about that gets what is meant

00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:59.270
by there being two standards
of justice in the country?

00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:02.110
&gt;&gt; Jabari Asim: And
related to that, Angela,

00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:04.600
the Black Lives Matter movement
has brought attention to the role

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:08.010
of prosecutors, it's a high
profile case, and so the behavior

00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:12.490
of prosecutors has sort of
entered the public conversation

00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:14.170
in a way that it hasn't often.

00:15:14.170 --> 00:15:17.310 position:56%
We talked about Robert McCulloch
following the killing of Mike Brown,

00:15:17.310 --> 00:15:21.770
in Ferguson Anita is now out of
office but following the killing

00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:27.170 position:56%
of Laquan McDonald in Chicago and
Marilyn Mosby following the killings

00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:28.790
of Freddie Gray in Baltimore.

00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:33.010
Now your book addresses among other
things what you call discretionary

00:15:33.010 --> 00:15:36.050
decision making on the
part of prosecutors.

00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:38.380
Can you tell us something
about that within the context

00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:40.260
of the movement for black lives?

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:41.560
&gt;&gt; Angela J. Davis: Sure.

00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:42.860
So that's one of the
things that I've noted

00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:44.510
that I found so interesting.

00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:46.140
I mean, what I've been trying

00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:49.350
to do is make people pay
attention to prosecutors.

00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:52.050
I mean, of course, we need
to pay attention to cops

00:15:52.050 --> 00:15:55.730
and there's been a lot of attention
paid to them unfortunately things

00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:58.430
that gotten better, they
seem to be getting worst.

00:15:58.430 --> 00:16:01.000
But very few people pay attention
to the prosecutor, right,

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.210
that when they are the
most powerful individual

00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:07.250 position:56%
in our criminal justice system, the
cop can stop a person on the street,

00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:09.720
can arrest them, can harass
them and that's awful,

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:12.230
but they can only bring the
person to the court house door.

00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:15.070
They do not make the decision
about whether that person stays

00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:17.240
in the system, the prosecutor does.

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:19.780
The prosecutor and the
prosecutor alone decides whether

00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:21.080
to charge the person.

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:23.600
They don't have to charge them if
they don't want to, we know that.

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:27.050
Now, when we see them not
charging cops, they decided what

00:16:27.050 --> 00:16:28.350
to charge the person with.

00:16:28.350 --> 00:16:31.920
And so, that discretion and it's
totally up to their discretion

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:33.780
to do so, them and them alone.

00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:37.400
That is an incredible power
that prosecutors have.

00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:40.000
And I don't think people have been
paying too much attention to it,

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.300
but one of the things that
has happened since all

00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:46.560
of these killings of-- on black men
have come to light and, of course,

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:50.010
you're Keeanga they've been
going on since slavery,

00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:54.090 position:56%
but we didn't have cell phone
cameras back then so no one believed

00:16:54.090 --> 00:16:55.870
that what happened happened.

00:16:55.870 --> 00:16:57.780
And now we see it happening.

00:16:57.780 --> 00:17:01.600
But now people are starting to pay
attention because I think, well,

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:05.870
wait a minute-- why-- I just
saw this cop murdered this man

00:17:05.870 --> 00:17:07.170
with my eyes.

00:17:07.170 --> 00:17:11.100
I saw Eric Garner being choked
to death with my two eyes.

00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:15.140
And the prosecutor did
not charge the cop.

00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:17.410
And so now, people
are paying attention

00:17:17.410 --> 00:17:20.330
to this powerful person,
the prosecutor.

00:17:20.330 --> 00:17:23.670
And they need to pay attention
because most the prosecutors,

00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:25.200
the vast majority of
them on the state

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:27.770
and local level are
elected officials.

00:17:27.770 --> 00:17:30.190
And their names are
on the ballot folks.

00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:33.100
And people don't pay
attention to those racist.

00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:36.190
A lot of the times-- most of the
times they ran unopposed but even

00:17:36.190 --> 00:17:40.150
when they do run against
other people, they don't talk

00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:43.210
about what they do behind closed
doors, they're charging decisions,

00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:44.510
they're plea-bargain decisions,

00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:46.960
most people aren't even
familiar with those terms.

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:48.740
They went on "I'm tough on crime"

00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:51.170
and their opponent says
"I'm tougher on crime."

00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:54.100 position:56%
And that's all they say about what
they do, but now people are starting

00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:57.560 position:56%
to pay attention to what they do
and started pay attention to racism.

00:17:57.560 --> 00:17:59.700
And one last thing I'll
say before you move

00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:03.350
on is Anita Alvarez
is a prime example.

00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:06.920
So Anita Alvarez was the
prosecutor in Chicago

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:09.990
and people didn't really pay
attention to what she was doing,

00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:14.080
but then when Laquan McDonald was
killed and there was a videotape

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:17.950
that was not released and she said
on that indicted, didn't move forth

00:18:17.950 --> 00:18:21.440
and it wasn't until a judge
ordered a release of that videotape

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:23.070
and we could see what
actually happened

00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:25.400
that she didn't decide
to charge that cop.

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:27.920
I firmly believe she
never would have

00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:29.880
if that videotape hadn't come out.

00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:33.850
The interesting thing about her
though is that when that happened,

00:18:33.850 --> 00:18:36.300
the media started to
investigate her background.

00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:40.290
And is turns out, she was one
of the worst prosecutors ever

00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:43.280
because she had engaged
in tremendous amounts

00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:45.720
of prosecutorial misconduct
throughout her 10-year

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:47.020
as a prosecutor.

00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:49.450
No one know about that, no one
was paying attention to it.

00:18:49.450 --> 00:18:50.750
And, of course, she was voted

00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:52.450
out because people
started paying attention

00:18:52.450 --> 00:18:54.830
and now Kim Foxx is the prosecutor.

00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:58.150
And then finally Marilyn Mosby
when you see the different way

00:18:58.150 --> 00:19:01.820
that she came in there and
she brought those indictments

00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:04.360
in the Freddie Gray case, but
we see what happened, right?

00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:05.660
No convictions.

00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:08.340
Absolutely no convictions, I'm
not saying that sort of fault,

00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:10.330
but they chose not
to have a jury trial.

00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:12.780 position:56%
And, of course, they were acquitted.

00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:16.960
I will say this, I-- in
terms of what prosecutors do,

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:21.880
we need to pay attention not only
to whether they're indicting cops,

00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:23.820
that's so important, we
need to pay attention

00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:26.240
to what are they doing every
day with the lives of black

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:29.120
and brown people who
they are charging.

00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:32.890
They're not charging cops but
they are steadily charging black

00:19:32.890 --> 00:19:34.960
and brown people over pay things.

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:38.460
And I will say including
my sister Marilyn Mosby,

00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:40.540
Baltimore has most terrible,

00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:44.030
some of the most terrible racial
disparities in the country.

00:19:44.030 --> 00:19:47.980
And so, I would like to talk
to her about maybe, you know,

00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:49.940
I'm glad she moved on those cops.

00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:53.750 position:56%
But, you know, why are so many black
and brown people being locked up,

00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:56.800
being charged in Baltimore over
petty things and locked up?

00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:59.030
She has the power to change that.

00:19:59.030 --> 00:20:00.970
And I hope that she will.

00:20:00.970 --> 00:20:03.500
&gt;&gt; Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor:
Do you think her movement

00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:07.530
on that though is indicative
about the moment

00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:12.440
because in my opinion the only
reason why she moved on that is

00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:14.650
because there is an
uprising in Baltimore

00:20:14.650 --> 00:20:20.590 position:56%
and the political establishment had
to do something to retain some level

00:20:20.590 --> 00:20:27.310
of legitimacy, because I think
that you can have a spectrum

00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:32.690
for where people felt--
who are prosecutors on it.

00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:36.630
So you have Draconian [phonetic]
law and order prosecutor,

00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:43.630
someone like Anita Alvarez and that
woman in Florida, what Angela--

00:20:43.630 --> 00:20:45.380
&gt;&gt; Angela J. Davis:
Angela-- we share a name.

00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:46.680
Corey.

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:47.980
&gt;&gt; Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor: Yes.

00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:49.280
OK. So you have that on
one end of the spectrum

00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:52.460
and then people will
point to Maryland,

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:56.550
Mosby on the other
end of the spectrum.

00:20:56.550 --> 00:21:00.000
But what gets lost in that
I think is, what is the job

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.410
of the prosecutor, which
is to prosecute people.

00:21:04.410 --> 00:21:11.980
And so, for Mosby in Baltimore even
though she was compelled I think

00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:16.010
because of the uprising to press
charges against six police officers

00:21:16.010 --> 00:21:21.260
in Baltimore, three weeks
before Freddie Gray was picked

00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:27.840
up by the police, she
individually put out a memo

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:35.620
that basically said she wanted more
eyes in hands on deck on the corner

00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:39.200
that Freddie Gray was picked
up, which police interpreted

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:41.900
or at least-- you know,
they set, they interpreted

00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:45.920
as a direct order to
produce more arrests.

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:52.170
And this is part of the
politicization of policing and law

00:21:52.170 --> 00:21:55.440
and order in cities in the
first place, which is so much

00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:59.180
of it is driven by arrest rates.

00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:03.130 position:56%
How many people can you arrest
which becomes political father for--

00:22:03.130 --> 00:22:06.780
is proof that you're
being tough on crime.

00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:08.960
And watching-- using

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:12.570
that to determine whether the
crime rate is rising or falling

00:22:12.570 --> 00:22:16.770
in a very political way not a
way that is substantive in terms

00:22:16.770 --> 00:22:22.170
of are we transforming the quality
of people's lives in this community

00:22:22.170 --> 00:22:28.580 position:56%
by actually ending crime through the
creation of good jobs, good schools

00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:32.280
and creating some sense
of community, not that

00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:37.800
but tracking the rise and fall
of arrest rates as a way to turn

00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:42.510
into a campaign slogan that
you are either tough on crime

00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:46.190
or you're opponent isn't
as tough as you are.

00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:48.630
And so, there's a whole logic

00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:54.160
that is generated among elected
officials including prosecutors

00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:58.950 position:56%
that has nothing to do with
actually improving the neighborhoods

00:22:58.950 --> 00:23:01.380 position:56%
and communities that people live in.

00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:04.170
But it's all about how you
can turn these situations

00:23:04.170 --> 00:23:07.860
into political capital
and it's a problem.

00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:12.160
&gt;&gt; Jabari Asim: And related to
that there doesn't appear to be--

00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:15.120 position:56%
since we-- the spotlight, the player
of the spotlight tends to move away

00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:17.860
from the prosecutor except
for doing electro campaigns.

00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:20.280
It doesn't seem to
be much transparency

00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:22.080
in terms of how they operate.

00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:28.400
And so, two factors there is the
only way to discipline prosecutors

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:30.150
by voting them out of office.

00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:33.850
And you've mentioned in your
book the role of bar associations

00:23:33.850 --> 00:23:38.180
and agencies within the
profession that ostensibly govern

00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:40.270 position:56%
or somehow overlooking some process.

00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:43.000
What can we-- what can we do?

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.640 position:56%
Is voting them out the only
recourse I guess is what I'm asking?

00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:46.940
&gt;&gt; Angela J. Davis: Yeah.

00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:50.710
So, you just stressed something
you said about transparent.

00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:52.700
There's no transparency, right?

00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:56.220 position:56%
So the most important decisions they
make out of that charging decision

00:23:56.220 --> 00:23:57.820
and the plea bargain decision.

00:23:57.820 --> 00:24:00.940
By the way, people think, you know,
there are all these trials going

00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:02.810
on because they're watching
law and order on TV.

00:24:02.810 --> 00:24:05.000
There are not a lot
of trials going on.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.960
Ninety-five percent of all
criminal cases are resolved

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:11.730
by way of a guilty plea, 95%.

00:24:11.730 --> 00:24:13.690
It's higher in some
jurisdictions, right?

00:24:13.690 --> 00:24:15.200
That's all on that issue.

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:16.500
But they control that too?

00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:19.330
They control the plea bargaining,
they control who gets to plea,

00:24:19.330 --> 00:24:21.050
what the plea is, whether
the person is going

00:24:21.050 --> 00:24:22.480
to be charged, whether they're not.

00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:24.180
There are a lot of people
who are committing crimes

00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:25.480
who are not being charged at all.

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:28.180
We don't know that
because [inaudible].

00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:31.620
We find that out when the media
investigates a certain case

00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:33.630
and that, oh now we know.

00:24:33.630 --> 00:24:35.360
But there's no way
for us to know that.

00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:37.350
That's so undemocratic, right?

00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:40.210
I mean, that's not what democracy
is supposed to be about, right?

00:24:40.210 --> 00:24:42.710
So I just want to stress that
point first and foremost.

00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:44.720
What can we do about it?

00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:46.020
So elections.

00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:48.050
As I said before, you know,

00:24:48.050 --> 00:24:51.760
most state in local prosecutors
are elected officials.

00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:55.200
The problem is that often
times when you go to vote,

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:59.130 position:56%
there's often one name there because
people don't challenge prosecutors.

00:24:59.130 --> 00:25:02.450
They-- some of them serve for
a decade, so there's term limit

00:25:02.450 --> 00:25:06.180
and as hard as we know to run for
office because it requires money.

00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:09.060
So, Obama called for example in
Ferguson, there was a black woman

00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:12.300
who actually challenged him
and she got nowhere, you know,

00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:15.550
she didn't have backing, he was
powerful in combat, you know,

00:25:15.550 --> 00:25:17.310
in terms of the population.

00:25:17.310 --> 00:25:21.160
They are African-Americans, you
know, they're in the minority

00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:22.810
in that particular county.

00:25:22.810 --> 00:25:25.360
So it's hard to vote them
out, but it can happen,

00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:26.760
[inaudible], you know who got out.

00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:31.890
And it's interesting
because I think she can--

00:25:31.890 --> 00:25:35.190
and Anita Alvarez was unseated
in Chicago I think largely

00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:39.480
because of the spotlight, national
spotlight coming on her similarly

00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:42.870
to the prosecutor in
Staten Island who failed

00:25:42.870 --> 00:25:45.930
to prosecute the cop
who killed Eric Garner.

00:25:45.930 --> 00:25:47.230
He was voted out.

00:25:47.230 --> 00:25:49.500
And largely people think
because of the spotlight.

00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:51.360
So it's interesting how
that's had an impact.

00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:54.300
But folks, we need to
pay attention and vote

00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:57.250
and the things you do is
question your prosecutors.

00:25:57.250 --> 00:25:59.740
I may ask them questions
when these things happen.

00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:01.040
Call them up.

00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:02.720
They're elected officials
just like everybody else.

00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:04.080
They have to be elected.

00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:05.870
You mentioned bar association.

00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:10.340
So another way to deal with
prosecutors who are misbehaving

00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:13.860
and engaging in this
conduct is bar council.

00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:19.540
So, people may remember the
Duke lacrosse case years ago,

00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:23.920
the prosecutor there Mike Nifong
was disbarred because of his--

00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:28.420
because of what happened in that
case and his failure to turn

00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:30.200
over exculpatory evidence.

00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:32.110
But, you know, who the defendants

00:26:32.110 --> 00:26:36.010
where they were wealthy
white lacrosse players

00:26:36.010 --> 00:26:41.150
who could afford fancy lawyers who
were able to investigate and go

00:26:41.150 --> 00:26:44.400
through all of it, DNA
complicated evidence and discover.

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:46.860
Oh the prosecutor didn't
turn this over.

00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:49.500
And so therefore, we're going
to refer him to bar council.

00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:53.980
So bar council is a body in every
state, which disciplines lawyers

00:26:53.980 --> 00:26:57.490
when they valuate the rules
of professional conduct.

00:26:57.490 --> 00:27:00.480
They can disbar them, they
can suspend them and so on.

00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:05.470
Prosecutors almost never, ever,
ever disbarred for anything.

00:27:05.470 --> 00:27:07.150
They're rarely referred.

00:27:07.150 --> 00:27:10.070
Mike Nifong was in fact the
first prosecutor I was aware

00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:11.690
of who was disbarred for the--

00:27:11.690 --> 00:27:14.870
his failure to turn over
exculpatory evidence,

00:27:14.870 --> 00:27:17.040
which is a violation of the rules.

00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:20.130
I can't tell you the number of
cases I had as public defender

00:27:20.130 --> 00:27:23.260
where prosecutors fail to
turnover exculpatory evidence.

00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:26.470
There are many high profile case
where people have gone in death row

00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:28.740
because prosecutors have
failed to turn it over.

00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:30.530
Were those prosecutors disbarred?

00:27:30.530 --> 00:27:33.320
No. Were they even
referred to bar council?

00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:36.920
No, nothing happened to that money
of them went on to become judges,

00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:41.510
being-- went on to become greater
things, but, you know, the Nifong--

00:27:41.510 --> 00:27:47.930
the lacrosse players had the power
to hit the stature and like, oh no.

00:27:47.930 --> 00:27:50.070
You know, they had
spent a day in jail.

00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:54.530
I mean nothing happened to them
yet that prosecutor was disbarred.

00:27:54.530 --> 00:27:58.000
This just blew my mind
because I was like that's--

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:01.470
well, can I think of the cases
of people like I said almost died

00:28:01.470 --> 00:28:03.040
because of something prosecutor do

00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:06.280
and those prosecutors
did not suffer anything.

00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:07.860
I am writing.

00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:12.310 position:56%
In fact, just wrote an article
called the Prosecutor's Ethical Duty

00:28:12.310 --> 00:28:14.950
to en masse incarceration
which I know sounds crazy

00:28:14.950 --> 00:28:17.730
but I think they have ethical
duty to en masse incarceration.

00:28:17.730 --> 00:28:19.030
And I used--

00:28:19.030 --> 00:28:20.330
[ Applause ]

00:28:20.330 --> 00:28:21.630
-- Thank you.

00:28:21.630 --> 00:28:22.930
[ Applause ]

00:28:22.930 --> 00:28:24.230
Because we have a crisis,

00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:27.660
we have 2.2 million people
in prisons, in jails.

00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:30.760
You know, these reports of black
and brown people, it's unfair.

00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:32.860
And they have the power
to stop that.

00:28:32.860 --> 00:28:36.130
They have the power to end
it in many different way.

00:28:36.130 --> 00:28:40.020
And so-- and I used the rules
and there are rules that talk

00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:42.660
about their ethical duty
to be ministers of justice

00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:44.250
and to administer justice.

00:28:44.250 --> 00:28:46.980
This is not just as what
they're doing here, it's not.

00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:49.310
So I'm making argument that
they have an ethical duty.

00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:54.010 position:56%
The problem with the rules though,
Jabari, is that the rules that apply

00:28:54.010 --> 00:28:56.990
to prosecutors are so weak, right?

00:28:56.990 --> 00:28:58.920
So there's so many
things prosecutors do

00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:00.740
that I think are unfair
and unethical,

00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:03.020
that are not under the rules.

00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:05.160
So we need to change
the rules and we need

00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:07.480
to use the rules that
we have to refer.

00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:10.100
Anybody can refer someone
a bar council.

00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:11.400
We don't have to be a lawyer.

00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:15.210
If they are aware of misconduct,
the problem is what you said

00:29:15.210 --> 00:29:18.350
and I'll stop here,
before lack of transparency

00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:20.260
to discover what they're doing

00:29:20.260 --> 00:29:23.280
in the first place,
right, is difficult.

00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:26.980
So you can't refer them if you
don't know about their doing.

00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:29.900 position:56%
So, I mean I think that's a problem.

00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:31.610
&gt;&gt; Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor: It is
the double standard of justice.

00:29:31.610 --> 00:29:33.300
&gt;&gt; Angela J. Davis: Yes, indeed.

00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:35.100
&gt;&gt; Jabari Asim: Keeanga, I wanted
to return to a point you made

00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:38.290
about that corner on which
Freddie Gray was arrested

00:29:38.290 --> 00:29:41.530
and he initially attracted
the attention

00:29:41.530 --> 00:29:44.880 position:56%
of the police by making eye contact.

00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:46.180
&gt;&gt; Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor: Yes.

00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:47.480
&gt;&gt; Jabari Asim: And that
made me think of a phrase.

00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:50.030
You have a number of phrases that
resonated with me and your book.

00:29:50.030 --> 00:29:53.210
One of them you talk about
criminalization creep

00:29:53.210 --> 00:29:57.890
in which this-- the notion of what
is criminal behavior continues

00:29:57.890 --> 00:30:01.270
to expand so that more and more
people are caught in the net.

00:30:01.270 --> 00:30:02.570
Can you talk more about that?

00:30:02.570 --> 00:30:03.870
&gt;&gt; Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor: Sure.

00:30:03.870 --> 00:30:10.020 position:56%
It's amazing that in a country that
purports to be for small government,

00:30:10.020 --> 00:30:16.290
liberty, not intrusive, you know,
state that if you look at the sort

00:30:16.290 --> 00:30:22.470
of growing lists of actions
that are becoming crimes,

00:30:22.470 --> 00:30:28.420
it's a complete front to that
logic so that in many cities now,

00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:34.210 position:56%
it's a crime to sit on the sidewalk,
it's a crime to sleep in your car.

00:30:34.210 --> 00:30:38.540
It's a crime to sleep
outside in public in general.

00:30:38.540 --> 00:30:43.330
It's a crime to ask for
money to beg for money.

00:30:43.330 --> 00:30:48.800
And there's a growing list of
what may perhaps be construed

00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:54.260
as a nuisance have been
transformed into criminal behavior.

00:30:54.260 --> 00:31:02.120
And the problem with this is this
approach to the law is manifest.

00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:08.100
I mean, there's the constant
invitation for engagement

00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:14.290
with the police, which then
creates an entire broader whirlwind

00:31:14.290 --> 00:31:17.980
of problems as a result
because one of the things

00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:23.190 position:56%
that we're finding now almost
directly as a result of the uprising

00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:27.680
in Ferguson is the way in
which the police in unison

00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:32.340
with city government and often
in unison with prosecutors.

00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:36.980
Almost act is a kleptocracy,
meaning that they've turned

00:31:36.980 --> 00:31:42.200
into official policy
stealing essentially from poor

00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:45.070
and working class people
partly as a way

00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:49.500
to fill the coffers
of municipalities.

00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:52.260
In Ferguson, there was
a direct relationship

00:31:52.260 --> 00:31:56.580
which was almost an order for
the police to draw a paycheck,

00:31:56.580 --> 00:32:04.920 position:56%
they had to rely on finding and feed
the black population of the city.

00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:08.800
And so, you end up with this
huge portion of the population

00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:13.250
in Ferguson with outstanding
warrants based on unpaid fees

00:32:13.250 --> 00:32:16.490
for traffic violations,
which makes no sense.

00:32:16.490 --> 00:32:21.430
And so, that is part of
the problem with the sort

00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:26.890
of growing criminalization of
non criminal offences in the way

00:32:26.890 --> 00:32:30.390
that it draws people in to
the criminal justice system

00:32:30.390 --> 00:32:37.070
through assortment of fines and
fees that if people can't pay,

00:32:37.070 --> 00:32:40.410
that then turn into
criminal offences

00:32:40.410 --> 00:32:44.180
that people are actually
are arrested for.

00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:49.200
And so, not only are the
police not attending to crime,

00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:51.970
but there are also
deepening poverty,

00:32:51.970 --> 00:32:57.730
they're also raising the
propensity for crime in these--

00:32:57.730 --> 00:33:00.650
in the communities that
they are targeting for this.

00:33:00.650 --> 00:33:06.130
And this I think has become part of
a larger critique of the movement

00:33:06.130 --> 00:33:07.810
in terms of targeting this.

00:33:07.810 --> 00:33:10.860
I think one of the things
that we have to focus

00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:16.660 position:56%
on in the movement is this issue of
decriminalization of actually trying

00:33:16.660 --> 00:33:23.920
to undue the criminalization of
these non criminal offenses for all

00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:27.230
of the complications that
come as a result of it.

00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:29.160
&gt;&gt; Jabari Asim: All right.

00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:30.700
That leads to a follow
up for both of you.

00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:33.180
But while you were talking also,
remember that you mentioned

00:33:33.180 --> 00:33:36.570 position:56%
in the book that there's one
neighboring municipality in Ferguson

00:33:36.570 --> 00:33:39.300
that actually rigged
the traffic light,

00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:41.850
so the police can turn
it red while cars were

00:33:41.850 --> 00:33:43.440
in the middle of the entry section.

00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:44.960
&gt;&gt; Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor: This
was a fundraising technique.

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:47.730
And it's not just some little
podoc [phonetic], you know,

00:33:47.730 --> 00:33:50.220
at least remember from the
duke's hazard, you know,

00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:54.680
all these tricks to, you know,
get people to run a red light

00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:56.720
or run stop signs or
you can give a ticket.

00:33:56.720 --> 00:34:01.110
In Chicago in the, you know,
second or third largest city

00:34:01.110 --> 00:34:06.260
in the United States, when
they went through implementing,

00:34:06.260 --> 00:34:10.330
I think there are more red
light cameras in Chicago

00:34:10.330 --> 00:34:13.520
than any other city in the country.

00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:17.590
Not only did they, you know,
put red light cameras everywhere

00:34:17.590 --> 00:34:21.700
where if you run a red light
it's an automatic $100 fine.

00:34:21.700 --> 00:34:26.340
If you don't pay it within
I think 60 days, it doubles.

00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:29.190
If you don't pay it within
another 30 days, it triples.

00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:33.830
And so you can see how
immediately this is something

00:34:33.830 --> 00:34:36.300
that ensnares working
class and poor people,

00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:38.720
but they shorten the yellow light.

00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:44.330
They shortened it, so that to
raise-- to increase the likelihood,

00:34:44.330 --> 00:34:48.780
the people would be, you know,
then running a red light.

00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:51.240
So not only are they putting
people's lives at risk

00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:55.500 position:56%
by shortening the red light and,
you know, compelling people to speed

00:34:55.500 --> 00:35:01.970
through it, but it's an actual
fundraising scheme by the city

00:35:01.970 --> 00:35:06.600
on the box of the people
who can least afford it.

00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:13.210
And so, the idea that elected
officials will be using the police

00:35:13.210 --> 00:35:19.430
as a way to bridge
financial gaps in the city is

00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:21.420
so problematic on so many levels.

00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:24.370
Not-- you know, not only
is this not what, you know,

00:35:24.370 --> 00:35:27.340
we are told police are supposed
to do, this has nothing to do

00:35:27.340 --> 00:35:31.210
with fighting crime,
not even in the least.

00:35:31.210 --> 00:35:35.230
But it also creates
an antagonism in terms

00:35:35.230 --> 00:35:39.280
of where the police are located,
who it is that they are trying

00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:45.520
to ticket, who it is that can
least afford to be indebted over,

00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:46.830
you know, parking tickets

00:35:46.830 --> 00:35:50.380
and red light tickets
and that sort of thing.

00:35:50.380 --> 00:35:51.680
&gt;&gt; Jabari Asim: OK.

00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:52.980
Follow up.

00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:54.690
I'm going to start with you Angela,
but I'm going to start with a quote

00:35:54.690 --> 00:35:56.580
from Keeanga, she wrote,
"You've written

00:35:56.580 --> 00:35:59.160
that historically the
vast majority of police

00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:03.500
in the United States were
white uneducated working class

00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:05.960
and completely consumed
with racism."

00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:10.260
And that made me think of the FBI's
own report about the infiltration

00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:14.500
of white supremacies in police
departments around the country.

00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:18.300
Colin Kaepernick has recently
contended that in some cities,

00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:22.070
cosmetologists require
more training than police.

00:36:22.070 --> 00:36:23.940
I'm noting all of these
during the time

00:36:23.940 --> 00:36:27.330
when the nation's largest police
union has endorsed Donald Trump's

00:36:27.330 --> 00:36:29.670
campaign for president.

00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:34.620
Within that context becomes hard
to regard community policing

00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:38.760
and restoring trust anything
other than skepticism.

00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:41.640 position:56%
Is reformed two gentle concept here.

00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:44.180
Should we be thinking of
something more extensive?

00:36:44.180 --> 00:36:48.370
&gt;&gt; Angela J. Davis: For
police you talk about?

00:36:48.370 --> 00:36:49.670
&gt;&gt; Jabari Asim: Yeah.

00:36:49.670 --> 00:36:50.970
&gt;&gt; Angela J. Davis: I think yes.

00:36:50.970 --> 00:36:53.750
I mean, the-- the idea of policing
has not been my focus in terms

00:36:53.750 --> 00:36:58.130
of coming up with things that
we should do, but I will say--

00:36:58.130 --> 00:37:00.540
in other words, there's
not my expertise

00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:03.480
about what should we do rather
than the reform we're doing now

00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:06.590 position:56%
but it's clear that whatever this
reform is we're doing now even work.

00:37:06.590 --> 00:37:10.150
And so, community policing
means so many different things

00:37:10.150 --> 00:37:11.840
and so many different areas.

00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:16.010
It certainly is not
anything that has stopped

00:37:16.010 --> 00:37:20.660
or in my opinion even reduce
the abuse that police, you know,

00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:23.120
rain down on communities of color.

00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:26.880
I mean, clearly that it has
not changed that at all.

00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:30.400
So, if it is going to be
continued reform, it has to look

00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:33.140
like something very
different than what it is now.

00:37:33.140 --> 00:37:37.270
So we know the president at this
taskforce on 21st century policing.

00:37:37.270 --> 00:37:40.730
And my good friend Tracey
Meares is on that taskforce.

00:37:40.730 --> 00:37:42.030
Bryan Stevenson is on.

00:37:42.030 --> 00:37:44.570
And they're great people
were on that taskforce.

00:37:44.570 --> 00:37:48.810
I mean, I just think-- and I'm,
you know, I hope that there's going

00:37:48.810 --> 00:37:50.510
to be some changes
of result of that.

00:37:50.510 --> 00:37:53.830
I think the problem is
that, you know, how--

00:37:53.830 --> 00:37:57.000
who makes police do
what they do, right?

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:00.210
It gets back to that like the
president can have this taskforce,

00:38:00.210 --> 00:38:03.960
but he actually has no direct power
over a local police department.

00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:05.710
He cannot make them do anything.

00:38:05.710 --> 00:38:09.710
38:05 make them do
unless they file a lawsuit

00:38:09.710 --> 00:38:11.280
and do the consent decrees.

00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:12.810
And I think those things
are important.

00:38:12.810 --> 00:38:15.160
I think they're report that
came out of Ferguson as a result

00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:16.690
of justice department's
investigation was

00:38:16.690 --> 00:38:17.990
incredibly important.

00:38:17.990 --> 00:38:19.710
They just did a similar
report in Baltimore.

00:38:19.710 --> 00:38:21.880
Those things are incredibly
important.

00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:26.460
But in terms of directly making
police officers behave differently,

00:38:26.460 --> 00:38:30.130
I think it has to be a, you know,
I don't even know how this is going

00:38:30.130 --> 00:38:34.660
to be done but there has to be a
totally different mindset in change

00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:37.290
about what police officers
are supposed to be doing.

00:38:37.290 --> 00:38:41.580
I mean, you're right, there's an
old training, require for them

00:38:41.580 --> 00:38:43.640
to come in, the background
or what kind

00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:45.210
of background checks they're doing.

00:38:45.210 --> 00:38:49.810
There's no psychological
testing done on a regular basis.

00:38:49.810 --> 00:38:51.970
I think some-- let's
put it this way.

00:38:51.970 --> 00:38:54.260
It varies from city to city.

00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:56.890
Some do none, some do some.

00:38:56.890 --> 00:38:58.780
They don't do them regularly.

00:38:58.780 --> 00:39:04.030
So, you know, we see the kind of
people who end up on police forces

00:39:04.030 --> 00:39:05.580
and what they are doing to people.

00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:10.540 position:56%
Many of them come out with this
militaristic idea of their policing,

00:39:10.540 --> 00:39:15.580 position:56%
they're there to, you know, control
those communities not to serve them.

00:39:15.580 --> 00:39:18.650
I mean, that's the
mindset of so many of them.

00:39:18.650 --> 00:39:21.180
And so, how we change
this nationally?

00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:26.140
I don't know, because the way
governance work the president can't

00:39:26.140 --> 00:39:28.480
come in and fire all the police.

00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:30.510
He doesn't have the
power to do that.

00:39:30.510 --> 00:39:35.400
So, so much of it is up to these
individual state local entities.

00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:38.620
That's why tell people, you know,
most police chiefs are pointed

00:39:38.620 --> 00:39:40.960
by the mayor, I mean
all politics is local

00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:44.450
and sometimes the most important
politics is local, right,

00:39:44.450 --> 00:39:49.230
because your police chief most
likely is appointed by your mayor.

00:39:49.230 --> 00:39:51.720
And so, you decide
who that mayor is.

00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:54.450
And when you vote, you need
to be asking your mayor.

00:39:54.450 --> 00:39:56.460
Who's going to be the police chief?

00:39:56.460 --> 00:39:59.760
I want a police chief who will not
going to be out here, you know,

00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:01.830
hiring police officers
that are going

00:40:01.830 --> 00:40:03.130
to be killing people for no reason.

00:40:03.130 --> 00:40:06.770
So it comes right down to that,
you know, to the basics sort

00:40:06.770 --> 00:40:08.290
of democratic tenets that we have.

00:40:08.290 --> 00:40:13.870
We need to get involved in a
local, in politics and ways to make

00:40:13.870 --> 00:40:17.750
that change because there's
no magic bullet that's going

00:40:17.750 --> 00:40:20.050
to change this from
around the country.

00:40:20.050 --> 00:40:22.660
I hope, I wish if there
is, I hope there is,

00:40:22.660 --> 00:40:24.280
but I don't know one, you know?

00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:28.570
I think it's that hard work of
getting in there individually

00:40:28.570 --> 00:40:31.650
in your communities becoming
active in your communities

00:40:31.650 --> 00:40:35.800
and saying you're not going to
have this in your community.

00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:39.480
And that involves getting on the
street, it involves demonstrating

00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:43.470
but it also involves voting
and being politically active.

00:40:43.470 --> 00:40:44.840
&gt;&gt; Jabari Asim: I'm going to ask

00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:48.140
that if you want Keeanga
response to that by her book.

00:40:48.140 --> 00:40:49.440
&gt;&gt; Angela J. Davis: I'm sorry.

00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:51.050
I want her response, so--

00:40:51.050 --> 00:40:52.350
&gt;&gt; Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor:
Can I just say really quickly?

00:40:52.350 --> 00:40:53.650
&gt;&gt; Angela J. Davis: Please?

00:40:53.650 --> 00:40:54.950 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Jabari Asim: Yes, please, please,
but I also want to encourage people

00:40:54.950 --> 00:40:57.470
if you have questions, you
can line up at the microphone.

00:40:57.470 --> 00:41:00.590
That was my last question if
you have a question or comment

00:41:00.590 --> 00:41:01.890
after Keeanga's response.

00:41:01.890 --> 00:41:03.190
Please.

00:41:03.190 --> 00:41:04.490 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor: I just--

00:41:04.490 --> 00:41:07.200
I will just say really quickly
because I do want to hear from--

00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:10.680
I know we wall want to hear
from the audience that one

00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:15.840
of the things I write in my book is
that there has been no golden age

00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:20.390
of policing that we can point
to to say here is a model

00:41:20.390 --> 00:41:26.990
of what good policing community
relationships look like.

00:41:26.990 --> 00:41:31.340 position:56%
And I think that's important because
we often hear politicians say,

00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:33.440
oh we have to rebuild
trust, you know,

00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:35.680
between the police
and the community.

00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:37.720
And so, what are you talking about?

00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:42.650
Because to rebuild trust means
that at some point there was trust

00:41:42.650 --> 00:41:45.570
to have been established
in the first place.

00:41:45.570 --> 00:41:51.710
And so, at every period you look
at 1992, the Los Angeles uprising,

00:41:51.710 --> 00:41:55.090
which in many ways was the sort

00:41:55.090 --> 00:41:59.590
of first videotape beating
the police are exonerated.

00:41:59.590 --> 00:42:03.510
You look at the 1960s, that
Kerner Commission that I talked

00:42:03.510 --> 00:42:08.630
about earlier listed the top
three reasons why there were these

00:42:08.630 --> 00:42:11.690
rebellions, successive
rebellions in hundreds of cities

00:42:11.690 --> 00:42:15.220
across the United States
over that five-year period.

00:42:15.220 --> 00:42:18.160
Poverty and unemployment,

00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:21.880
substandard housing,
police brutality.

00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:28.610
1951, contingent of activist
in the United States went

00:42:28.610 --> 00:42:31.220
to present a petition
to the United States.

00:42:31.220 --> 00:42:34.390
They called themselves
We Charge Genocide.

00:42:34.390 --> 00:42:37.540
It was all about police
violence and abuse.

00:42:37.540 --> 00:42:39.960
The first modern urban uprising

00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:45.050
in the United States involving a
predominantly black population,

00:42:45.050 --> 00:42:47.160
Harlem 1935.

00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:52.660
Why? The police killed a
15-year-old boy and, you know,

00:42:52.660 --> 00:42:55.790
outside of a shop in
the neighborhood.

00:42:55.790 --> 00:43:01.160
And so, there is no point at which
we can talk about good policing

00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:05.310
as a model, which for me
raises all sorts of questions

00:43:05.310 --> 00:43:08.550
about the institution
of policing itself

00:43:08.550 --> 00:43:13.040
and whether it is actually
setup an existent way

00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:18.510
to do what we are constantly
told that it is supposed to do.

00:43:18.510 --> 00:43:26.210
[ Applause ]

00:43:26.210 --> 00:43:27.510
&gt;&gt; Jabari Asim: We
have a number of people

00:43:27.510 --> 00:43:30.490
and very little time
to accommodate that.

00:43:30.490 --> 00:43:32.430
Let's start over there
and then we'll alternate

00:43:32.430 --> 00:43:34.430
from microphone to microphone.

00:43:34.430 --> 00:43:35.730
&gt;&gt; Keeanga-Yamahtta
Taylor: And we'll be quick.

00:43:35.730 --> 00:43:37.030
&gt;&gt; Hello? OK.

00:43:37.030 --> 00:43:38.980
Thank you both for this
very important discussion.

00:43:38.980 --> 00:43:41.500
And as a young attorney,
I'm particularly glad

00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:45.360
that you have talked so much
about prosecutorial discretion

00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:47.500
and the role that plays in
the criminal justice system.

00:43:47.500 --> 00:43:52.000
And you mentioned so much about the
role of voting in local elections.

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:56.360
Yeah. We have so many state laws
that disenfranchise many black

00:43:56.360 --> 00:43:59.380
and brown people particularly
those who were brought

00:43:59.380 --> 00:44:00.780
into the criminal justice system

00:44:00.780 --> 00:44:03.330
on their perhaps questionable
circumstances

00:44:03.330 --> 00:44:05.740
and now lost their right to vote.

00:44:05.740 --> 00:44:09.460
Can you comment on how
that particular phenomenon

00:44:09.460 --> 00:44:13.180
if you will dovetails with
this entire discussion

00:44:13.180 --> 00:44:14.480
that you had so far?

00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:15.780
Thank you.

00:44:15.780 --> 00:44:18.070
&gt;&gt; Angela J. Davis: So I'm going
to put my friend Nicole Porter

00:44:18.070 --> 00:44:23.130
on this-- raise your hand
Nicole, raise your hand higher.

00:44:23.130 --> 00:44:26.440 position:56%
Nicole is at the Sentencing Project,

00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:28.110
which is a wonderful
organization here

00:44:28.110 --> 00:44:31.010
in the District of Columbia and--

00:44:31.010 --> 00:44:32.680
[ Applause ]

00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:36.040
-- and the citizen
probably does great work

00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:38.510
around felony disenfranchisement.

00:44:38.510 --> 00:44:40.240
And in fact, there are many states

00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:42.360
where people actually
do have the right

00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:44.990
to vote even they have
a felony conviction.

00:44:44.990 --> 00:44:48.930
And there's a lot of information
on their website about that.

00:44:48.930 --> 00:44:53.060
So I think, you know, the--
that is a huge problem.

00:44:53.060 --> 00:44:56.810 position:56%
In fact, there's so many people have
lost their right to vote as a result

00:44:56.810 --> 00:44:59.930
of that, but there are changes
going on in many states around,

00:44:59.930 --> 00:45:02.690
then there's a lot of action around
changing that including right

00:45:02.690 --> 00:45:04.060
in the commonwealth of Virginia,

00:45:04.060 --> 00:45:07.160
although what the government
did there is being challenged.

00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:10.190
But I think that people
may have the right to vote

00:45:10.190 --> 00:45:11.740
if they have a conviction.

00:45:11.740 --> 00:45:13.060
They may still have
the right to vote,

00:45:13.060 --> 00:45:14.680
they need to research
that to find out.

00:45:14.680 --> 00:45:18.390
So I'm going to direct folks to the
Sentencing Project's website and go

00:45:18.390 --> 00:45:21.300
to Nicole afterwards and
she'll tell you all about that.

00:45:21.300 --> 00:45:24.610 position:56%
But I think that's a great point,
so many people have lost their right

00:45:24.610 --> 00:45:27.220
to vote, but many people have their
right and they aren't using it

00:45:27.220 --> 00:45:32.800
and so, I'm encouraging
those who do to do so.

00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:36.560
&gt;&gt; I'm from North Carolina and as
you know we have a law that's going

00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:43.380
in the book October 1st to keep
plea stems out of public view.

00:45:43.380 --> 00:45:48.090
And I was wondering if
other states have that law.

00:45:48.090 --> 00:45:52.290
If you think other states will
adapt it and is there any basis

00:45:52.290 --> 00:45:55.770
which that could get off the books.

00:45:55.770 --> 00:45:57.070
&gt;&gt; Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor:

00:45:57.070 --> 00:46:00.800
Interestingly Missouri I believe
is the only other state right now

00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:02.860
that has passed a law.

00:46:02.860 --> 00:46:08.640
But basically it says the body
camera footage cannot be released--

00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:11.460
will not be released to
the public unless it is

00:46:11.460 --> 00:46:16.810
up to the discretion I believe
of either the police or a judge,

00:46:16.810 --> 00:46:21.940
which of course undermines the
entire point of the transparency

00:46:21.940 --> 00:46:26.640
that was intended with that
legislation in the first place.

00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:32.780 position:56%
I absolutely think that this has the
potential to be a kind of copycat

00:46:32.780 --> 00:46:39.080 position:56%
in other states, which are much more
concerned with what they believe

00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:44.910
to be protecting the legitimacy
of their police forces than the,

00:46:44.910 --> 00:46:50.720
you know, providing transparency to
what is still a public institution.

00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:55.260
People forget when there is a
reluctance to release the names

00:46:55.260 --> 00:47:00.730
of police officers who kill
civilians releasing footage

00:47:00.730 --> 00:47:02.260
from body cameras.

00:47:02.260 --> 00:47:04.300
These are public institutions.

00:47:04.300 --> 00:47:06.150
That means that they should be

00:47:06.150 --> 00:47:09.770
under the most intense
scrutiny of the public.

00:47:09.770 --> 00:47:13.650
And so that is one of the
things that we have to keep

00:47:13.650 --> 00:47:17.790
in the forefront of
our protest is not--

00:47:17.790 --> 00:47:19.310
you know, this isn't
a moral question,

00:47:19.310 --> 00:47:26.210
this is about public servants
having to answer to the taxpayers

00:47:26.210 --> 00:47:31.970
who provide their salaries
in the first place.

00:47:31.970 --> 00:47:33.270
&gt;&gt; Carlos: Hi.

00:47:33.270 --> 00:47:34.570
My name is Carlos.

00:47:34.570 --> 00:47:35.870
Thank you for having
this conversation.

00:47:35.870 --> 00:47:38.900
I just wanted to make a
comment to draw parallels.

00:47:38.900 --> 00:47:41.480
I'm a public school teacher,
worked for seven years

00:47:41.480 --> 00:47:42.780
in the parallels of schools.

00:47:42.780 --> 00:47:45.360
And the common variable is control.

00:47:45.360 --> 00:47:51.380
So we unfortunately law enforcement
control rather than tax schools.

00:47:51.380 --> 00:47:55.010
I saw a lot of times that it's
control rather than educating.

00:47:55.010 --> 00:47:58.820
So it's that common variable and
how do we change that culture

00:47:58.820 --> 00:48:03.690
from the very start, right,
of seeing minorities as people

00:48:03.690 --> 00:48:05.870
that we need to get
educated versus control.

00:48:05.870 --> 00:48:09.850
And as a result don't grow
up thinking that, you know,

00:48:09.850 --> 00:48:14.740
they are a problem for law
enforcement and those students

00:48:14.740 --> 00:48:17.780
who were with them as
cops see them as someone

00:48:17.780 --> 00:48:19.860
to control versus to protect.

00:48:19.860 --> 00:48:21.570
So I just wanted to
make that comment

00:48:21.570 --> 00:48:24.510
because those parallels
were just came to mind

00:48:24.510 --> 00:48:25.980
as I heard the discussion.

00:48:25.980 --> 00:48:27.860
But thank you again
for the discussion.

00:48:27.860 --> 00:48:29.160
&gt;&gt; Angela J. Davis: Thank you.

00:48:29.160 --> 00:48:30.460
&gt;&gt; Jabari Asim: Thank you.

00:48:30.460 --> 00:48:32.150
&gt;&gt; Thank you for the conversation.

00:48:32.150 --> 00:48:35.640
I just-- my question
is for professor Davis.

00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:38.360
As you know being a public
defender service lawyer,

00:48:38.360 --> 00:48:43.100
are prosecutors mostly
are US attorneys

00:48:43.100 --> 00:48:45.740
who obviously the US
attorney for the District

00:48:45.740 --> 00:48:48.680
of Columbia is appointed
and is not elected.

00:48:48.680 --> 00:48:50.510
And similarly all of our judges

00:48:50.510 --> 00:48:53.800
in DC superior court are
appointed by the president.

00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:57.270
So I know you mentioned bar
council complaints and obvious--

00:48:57.270 --> 00:49:03.010
and I think that that's a crucial
way to try to help shine some light

00:49:03.010 --> 00:49:06.630
on prosecutorial conduct, but
specifically for those of us

00:49:06.630 --> 00:49:08.880
who are district citizens here.

00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:12.190
What can we do to try
to hold both our judges

00:49:12.190 --> 00:49:14.210
and our prosecutors accountable?

00:49:14.210 --> 00:49:15.990 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Angela J. Davis: Did you say
you're a public defender here in DC?

00:49:15.990 --> 00:49:18.010
&gt;&gt; No I said, you're
a public defendant.

00:49:18.010 --> 00:49:19.790
[ Laughter ]

00:49:19.790 --> 00:49:21.740
Attorney but not a public defender.

00:49:21.740 --> 00:49:23.040
&gt;&gt; Angela J. Davis: Yes, I was.

00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:26.600 position:56%
So DC is that strange animal out of
all because it's not a state, right?

00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:30.700
And so, the US attorney, which is
a federal prosecutor every state

00:49:30.700 --> 00:49:33.990
as a US attorney, one or
more US attorneys, prosecutor

00:49:33.990 --> 00:49:35.860
and federal court, but in DC,

00:49:35.860 --> 00:49:40.350 position:56%
the US attorney prosecutes both the
local crimes and the federal crimes.

00:49:40.350 --> 00:49:41.800
So you can't-- right.

00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:43.100
So they're appointing.

00:49:43.100 --> 00:49:46.540
So you can't vote in the US
attorney because they're federal.

00:49:46.540 --> 00:49:47.840
So what do you?

00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:50.050
Well, you know, that make--

00:49:50.050 --> 00:49:53.250
I was talking about how voting is
the mechanism of accountability

00:49:53.250 --> 00:49:57.850 position:56%
for prosecutors, but it doesn't work
because there's no transparency,

00:49:57.850 --> 00:50:00.090
but when there's voting it's
hard to pick a good person.

00:50:00.090 --> 00:50:02.810
It's even worst when it's
a federal prosecutor.

00:50:02.810 --> 00:50:06.020
Technically the way you
do it is you weigh in when

00:50:06.020 --> 00:50:09.420
that prosecutor is nominated,
the person is nominated

00:50:09.420 --> 00:50:13.460
to be US attorney then you are
supposed to write, you know,

00:50:13.460 --> 00:50:17.490
if you had a senator, which
DC doesn't really have one.

00:50:17.490 --> 00:50:20.050
But you weigh in that way, right?

00:50:20.050 --> 00:50:23.910
You call Illinois homes north or
whoever and you say, you know,

00:50:23.910 --> 00:50:27.570
I don't think this person should
be the prosecutor, US attorney.

00:50:27.570 --> 00:50:30.440
The problem is the same
as it is everywhere else

00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:33.150
because you don't know what
that person has been doing

00:50:33.150 --> 00:50:37.050
as a prosecutor because he's
done behind close doors is not a

00:50:37.050 --> 00:50:38.350
perfect system.

00:50:38.350 --> 00:50:39.650
I don't-- when I tell people

00:50:39.650 --> 00:50:42.220
to go vote I'm not saying that's
the magic wand that's going

00:50:42.220 --> 00:50:45.750
to solve everything, it's the
mechanism the system that we have.

00:50:45.750 --> 00:50:50.850
As far as judges are concerned, I
don't think necessarily the voting

00:50:50.850 --> 00:50:54.300
and elected judge is a
good idea either, right,

00:50:54.300 --> 00:50:57.550
because that happens
a lot in the south.

00:50:57.550 --> 00:50:59.790
They're-- in fact in a lot
of the death penalty stage,

00:50:59.790 --> 00:51:02.750
you have judges running for
office who are actually running

00:51:02.750 --> 00:51:07.330
on I will make sure we get
more death penalty cases going

00:51:07.330 --> 00:51:11.130
through than others that
are running on that.

00:51:11.130 --> 00:51:14.060
So a lot of times, you know,
when it comes to judges,

00:51:14.060 --> 00:51:15.420
we have a very different function

00:51:15.420 --> 00:51:17.860
from prosecutors having
elected judges

00:51:17.860 --> 00:51:20.120
and not necessarily
the answer either,

00:51:20.120 --> 00:51:21.420
but hank you for your question.

00:51:21.420 --> 00:51:23.980
You raised a good point.

00:51:23.980 --> 00:51:26.620
&gt;&gt; Hi. I'm currently
a high school student,

00:51:26.620 --> 00:51:28.810
a senior at the Landon
School for Boys.

00:51:28.810 --> 00:51:31.770
And I'm the President
of MSA and BSU there.

00:51:31.770 --> 00:51:35.680
And I was wondering what is
your stunts on reparations

00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:37.220
for African-Americans
in the United States?

00:51:37.220 --> 00:51:40.990
Do you think it would be beneficial
or it would reduce catalyst

00:51:40.990 --> 00:51:43.790
on ongoing political movements
like Black Lives Matter?

00:51:43.790 --> 00:51:47.620
And by reparations, I don't
entirely mean economical.

00:51:47.620 --> 00:51:55.950
&gt;&gt; Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor: I
mean, I'm certainly for reparations

00:51:55.950 --> 00:52:01.300
for African-Americans because
I think that we see the ways

00:52:01.300 --> 00:52:08.750 position:56%
that legal racism and discrimination
in particular not just in slavery

00:52:08.750 --> 00:52:12.570
but very much in the 20th
century continues to impact

00:52:12.570 --> 00:52:14.090
and shape black realities.

00:52:14.090 --> 00:52:20.750
I think that the author Ta-Nehisi
Coates did us all a great favor

00:52:20.750 --> 00:52:26.530
by connecting the struggle around
reparations not just to the issue

00:52:26.530 --> 00:52:29.980
of slavery, but to
the contemporary ways

00:52:29.980 --> 00:52:35.390
that racial discrimination
constrains black file particularly

00:52:35.390 --> 00:52:41.340
by looking at the role of
government in particular

00:52:41.340 --> 00:52:47.230
in legislating discriminatory
practices around housing and access

00:52:47.230 --> 00:52:48.830
to housing and red lighting.

00:52:48.830 --> 00:52:54.200
And in a country where so much
personal wealth is vested in access

00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:59.190
to home ownership in the way
that the federal government

00:52:59.190 --> 00:53:03.070
in particular work to
exclude black people

00:53:03.070 --> 00:53:05.970
from that enterprise
has continued to--

00:53:05.970 --> 00:53:11.630
had implications over generations
in a way that people are often able

00:53:11.630 --> 00:53:18.980
to obscure the kind of lineages
that exist between slavery.

00:53:18.980 --> 00:53:21.760
And who would be the
direct beneficiary today

00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:24.300
and I didn't known a
slave and all of that.

00:53:24.300 --> 00:53:28.320 position:56%
Instead of having that debate, let's
talk about how throughout the course

00:53:28.320 --> 00:53:35.150
of the 20th century, public policy
has actively undermine black life

00:53:35.150 --> 00:53:37.780
chances, black quality of life.

00:53:37.780 --> 00:53:43.970
And so in that context, I'm
very much for reparations.

00:53:43.970 --> 00:53:50.340
I'm for checks, for public policy
programs, I'm for all sorts

00:53:50.340 --> 00:53:54.860
of the creations of all sorts
of programs and institutions

00:53:54.860 --> 00:53:58.110
that can substantively
improve the quality

00:53:58.110 --> 00:54:00.860
of black life in this country.

00:54:00.860 --> 00:54:03.010
&gt;&gt; Jabari Asim: We
have two minutes left.

00:54:03.010 --> 00:54:04.310
[ Applause ]

00:54:04.310 --> 00:54:07.370
So we probably have time
for one more question.

00:54:07.370 --> 00:54:08.670
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:54:08.670 --> 00:54:11.710
I'm really excited that I
get to ask this question.

00:54:11.710 --> 00:54:13.100
And I'm also really excited

00:54:13.100 --> 00:54:17.340
to be here the same
week that I Keeanga is.

00:54:17.340 --> 00:54:19.560
I'm here from Standing
Rock, North Dakota.

00:54:19.560 --> 00:54:22.570
Anyways, I was wondering
Keeanga if-- thank you.

00:54:22.570 --> 00:54:25.480
I was wondering if you could speak

00:54:25.480 --> 00:54:29.420
on white supremacism inherently
built into our institutions

00:54:29.420 --> 00:54:32.760
and your perspective on how we can
achieve liberation when we live

00:54:32.760 --> 00:54:35.440
in a wealthy society built
on land theft and genocide

00:54:35.440 --> 00:54:38.810
of native Americans then slave and
then exploitation of free labor

00:54:38.810 --> 00:54:40.880
of Africans and the
continued oppression

00:54:40.880 --> 00:54:43.700
of the entire working class?

00:54:43.700 --> 00:54:45.000
&gt;&gt; Jabari Asim: Wow.

00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:46.300
&gt;&gt; Angela J. Davis: In two minutes.

00:54:46.300 --> 00:54:49.520
&gt;&gt; Sorry. I hope we
can get him asked too.

00:54:49.520 --> 00:54:51.490
&gt;&gt; Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor: I
mean, the one thing I would say

00:54:51.490 --> 00:54:55.840
about that, and thank you for
the question, is, you know,

00:54:55.840 --> 00:55:02.380
I think we're in this season where
everyone talks about the importance

00:55:02.380 --> 00:55:05.620
of voting and supremacy
of voting and all that.

00:55:05.620 --> 00:55:09.880
And that's, you know, that's
fine and well, but reality is--

00:55:09.880 --> 00:55:13.390
in my opinion that the
greatest substantive changes

00:55:13.390 --> 00:55:17.930
that have happened for poor
oppressed and working class people

00:55:17.930 --> 00:55:22.220
in this country have come as a
result of struggle and have come

00:55:22.220 --> 00:55:24.430 position:56%
as a result of movements [applause].

00:55:24.430 --> 00:55:27.940
And so, we have to have the
perspective of no matter who is

00:55:27.940 --> 00:55:30.800
in the White House
because, you know,

00:55:30.800 --> 00:55:36.820
Donald Trump is menacing bigoted
billionaire, but then a lot

00:55:36.820 --> 00:55:41.030
of what we are talking about
in terms of mass incarceration,

00:55:41.030 --> 00:55:44.140
in terms of the racialization

00:55:44.140 --> 00:55:49.220
of black people negatively
the architecture was put

00:55:49.220 --> 00:55:51.310
in place 20 years ago.

00:55:51.310 --> 00:55:53.540
I mean it was put in
place a long time ago,

00:55:53.540 --> 00:55:56.510
but the Clinton administration
in the 1990s,

00:55:56.510 --> 00:56:01.540
which gave us the crime bill in
1994, which gave us super predators

00:56:01.540 --> 00:56:05.840
and which ended welfare 20
years ago on the premise

00:56:05.840 --> 00:56:10.540
of a racist contention that black
people were somehow feeding off the

00:56:10.540 --> 00:56:13.910
system unequally or unfairly.

00:56:13.910 --> 00:56:17.230
It means that both parties are
complicit in what is happening

00:56:17.230 --> 00:56:19.010
to foreign working people.

00:56:19.010 --> 00:56:20.360
[ Applause ]

00:56:20.360 --> 00:56:25.000
And so, it really how we overcome
that depends on the strength

00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:27.620 position:56%
of our organizing and our movements.

00:56:27.620 --> 00:56:30.830
And so, the Black Lives
Matter have to connect

00:56:30.830 --> 00:56:35.590
up with the undocumented movement
have to connect up with Arabs

00:56:35.590 --> 00:56:39.260
and Muslims in the movement against
Islamophobia, have to connect

00:56:39.260 --> 00:56:41.810
up with the brothers
and sisters fighting,

00:56:41.810 --> 00:56:46.100
the pipeline in South
Dakota, in every other places

00:56:46.100 --> 00:56:49.940
around this country to build
a larger more united movement.

00:56:49.940 --> 00:56:54.510
And that's how we as ordinary
people advance our cause.

00:56:54.510 --> 00:56:57.300
[ Applause ]

00:56:57.300 --> 00:57:00.490
&gt;&gt; Angela J. Davis: I--
I have to say one thing,

00:57:00.490 --> 00:57:02.350
I agree with everything
that Keeanga has said,

00:57:02.350 --> 00:57:04.490
but please don't stay
home on November 8.

00:57:04.490 --> 00:57:06.220
And please come out and vote

00:57:06.220 --> 00:57:09.220
and let Donald Trump become the
president of the United States.

00:57:09.220 --> 00:57:10.690
I'm sorry I had to say that.

00:57:10.690 --> 00:57:11.990
Thank you.

00:57:11.990 --> 00:57:13.380
&gt;&gt; Jabari Asim: We are
over of our allotted time.

00:57:13.380 --> 00:57:15.370
Thank you all very much.

00:57:15.370 --> 00:57:16.670
Thank you.

00:57:16.670 --> 00:57:19.560
Thanks to our family.

00:57:19.560 --> 00:57:22.780

of the Library of Congress.
