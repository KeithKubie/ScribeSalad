(funky music)

00:00:04.404 --> 00:00:05.905 line:0%
- We all started.

00:00:05.905 --> 00:00:08.808 line:0%
I mean, just specifically,
Hannibal, Arturo and us.

00:00:08.808 --> 00:00:10.844 line:0%
None of us had any experience,

00:00:10.844 --> 00:00:12.312 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
we didn't have
like TV experience.

00:00:12.312 --> 00:00:14.381
We're working on Broad City all
year but Hannibal and Arturo

00:00:14.381 --> 00:00:16.149
are going an acting
on different things,

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:18.351
and I really felt their
experience come back

00:00:18.351 --> 00:00:20.420
to the set and feed the set.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.622 align:start size:97% position:3% line:0%
- It's good to see everybody,
it's good to see just how

00:00:22.622 --> 00:00:26.826
they've grown as actors, as
businesswomen, as creators.

00:00:28.294 --> 00:00:30.764 align:start size:84% position:16%
They've both directed
episodes now,

00:00:30.764 --> 00:00:32.732
it's been great to
see the progression.

00:00:32.732 --> 00:00:36.302 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Jamie, be strong,
penis, be weak, be weak

00:00:37.737 --> 00:00:40.707 align:start size:94% position:6%
- They're so talented
both of them, in their own

00:00:40.707 --> 00:00:42.909 align:start size:81% position:19%
individual ways
and I hope that we

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:44.711
keep writing to their strengths

00:00:44.711 --> 00:00:46.546 align:start size:84% position:16%
but their strengths
keep expanding

00:00:46.546 --> 00:00:49.449
and I feel like I
learned more about

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:51.918
how good they were
from directing them.

00:00:51.918 --> 00:00:53.653
- Okay, so we have
to talk about this

00:00:53.653 --> 00:00:54.654
whole relationship thing

00:00:54.654 --> 00:00:56.189
- What

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:57.023
- Think about what we have
sacrificed to enter this

00:00:57.023 --> 00:00:58.324
sexless fart party.

00:00:59.592 --> 00:01:01.694
- People get emotionally
invested with characters

00:01:01.694 --> 00:01:03.463 align:start size:84% position:16%
I've done it before
with a television show

00:01:03.463 --> 00:01:04.731
when somebody break
up, you're like,

00:01:04.731 --> 00:01:07.200
they broke up, I
can't believe it

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.103
I want them to get back together

00:01:10.103 --> 00:01:11.204
Hello my dear

00:01:12.405 --> 00:01:15.341
- [Ilana] Hello my
um, my fluid dude

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.479
- [Hannibal] They never really
doubted that I would be back

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:23.450 align:start size:97% position:3%
and that I didn't, but I
think the fans really thought

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:24.951
I was off the show.

00:01:24.951 --> 00:01:26.519
- He's my boyfriend

00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:29.522 align:start size:97% position:3%
- I'm having sex with a
girl, afterwards she's like,

00:01:29.522 --> 00:01:31.624 align:start size:84% position:16%
so you know if you're
going to be back?

00:01:31.624 --> 00:01:34.461
Hey, this isn't the time
for that first of all,

00:01:34.461 --> 00:01:36.229
this is not what we're here for.

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:38.364
This is not a meet and greet.

00:01:38.364 --> 00:01:40.433
This is not an interview.

00:01:40.433 --> 00:01:43.269 align:start size:97% position:3%
I don't want to talk
storylines with you right now

00:01:43.269 --> 00:01:45.772
I just met you four hours ago.

00:01:45.772 --> 00:01:48.274
