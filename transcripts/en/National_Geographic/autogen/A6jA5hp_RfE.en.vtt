kilometer stretch of beach in three or
 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.000
kilometer stretch of beach in three or
four days so it's a lot of turtles and

four days so it's a lot of turtles and
 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:05.560
four days so it's a lot of turtles and
not a lot of space

into seven days in each turtle lays a
hundred eggs and that's how many

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360
hundred eggs and that's how many
 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.180

and a lot of those eggs are just getting
 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.360
and a lot of those eggs are just getting
destroyed by the same turtles themselves

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:21.370
