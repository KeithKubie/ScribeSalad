00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.139
This is the exact same problem
that I did in the last video,

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:04.930
but I realized after
looking at the problem

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:06.910
that I just mindlessly
did the problem.

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:09.280
But there's actually a much
simpler way of doing it.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.720
So once again, they're telling
us to subtract and state

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.070
the difference in simplest form.

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:14.570
And what I did in
the last video is,

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:16.750
I just said, OK, let's
find a common denominator.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.110
And then I found it, and
then I did the subtraction.

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:20.610
But what I could
have done, and that

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:22.193
would have simplified
all of the math,

00:00:22.193 --> 00:00:25.250
is I could have simplified each
of these expressions first.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:26.550
So let's do that.

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.140
So this first expression right
over here, both the numerator

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.760
and the denominator
is divisible by m.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.370
So let's divide them both by m.

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.510
If you divide the
numerator by m, you get 1.

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.430
You divide the denominator
by m, m squared divided by m

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.380
is just m.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.400
The second term right
over here, both of them,

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.470
both the numerator and the
denominator, are divisible by n

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:48.180
to the third power.

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.830
So let's divide the numerator
by n to the third power.

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:51.920
You get a 1.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.340
You divide the denominator,
you divide n to the fourth

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.540
by n to the third power,
you just get an n.

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.700
And so we can rewrite
this as 6-- 6 times 1,

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:08.440
so that's just 6-- 6
over 7mn, minus 5--

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.130
because that's just
5 times 1-- over 3mn.

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.840
And this really
simplifies the problem.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.690
So let's think about a
common denominator over here.

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.420
So it's going to be
something minus something.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.070
So a common denominator has to
be divisible by both 7 and 3.

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.150
So the least common
multiple of 7 and 3 is 21.

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.530
And it has to be
divisible by m, and it

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.180
has to be divisible by n.

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.300
21mn, and that also
takes care of this.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.050
21mn is clearly
divisible by 7mn,

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.170
and it's clearly
divisible by 3mn.

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.170
It's got the mn there.

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:42.910
It's divisible by 3,
it's divisible by 7.

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:46.250
So that's our least
common multiple,

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.800
or you could say it's
our common denominator.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.772
And to get from 7mn to 21mn,
you've got to multiply by 3.

00:01:52.772 --> 00:01:54.730
And if you're multiplying
the denominator by 3,

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:56.870
you've got to multiply
the numerator by 3.

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:01.110
And you get 3 times
6 is equal to 18.

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.570
And to go from 3mn to 21mn,
you've got to multiply by 7.

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.870
I'll do it over here, you've
got to multiply it by 7.

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:10.250
And if you multiply
the denominator by 7,

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.290
you've got to multiply
the numerator by 7

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.830
if you don't want to change
the value of the expression.

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.710
So 5 times 7 is equal to 35.

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:23.820
And then so this is going
to be equal to 18 minus 35,

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.720
since we have-- let
me write it down--

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.362
we have a common
denominator here of 21mn.

00:02:29.362 --> 00:02:31.790
And we're going to have
to calculate 18 minus 35

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:32.550
in the numerator.

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.070
I'll just write it over here,
18 minus 35 in the numerator.

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:41.430
And 18 minus 35 is negative 17.

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.870
So we get negative 17 in
the numerator, over 21mn,

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.116
and we are done.

00:02:48.116 --> 00:02:49.740
And I think that was
a good bit simpler

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.560
than the way we did
it in the last video.
