00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.959
 
you know scientists have tried for

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969
you know scientists have tried for
 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.390
you know scientists have tried for
decades to find something wrong with

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400
decades to find something wrong with
 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.150
decades to find something wrong with
caffeine and they can't no matter how

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160
caffeine and they can't no matter how
 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.179
caffeine and they can't no matter how
hard they try we metabolize caffeine

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189
hard they try we metabolize caffeine
 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.190
hard they try we metabolize caffeine
some of us metabolize it better than

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:22.200
some of us metabolize it better than
 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.100
some of us metabolize it better than
others I happen to be a fast metabolizer

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:25.110
others I happen to be a fast metabolizer
 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:28.609
others I happen to be a fast metabolizer
so it doesn't affect me at all unless I

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619
so it doesn't affect me at all unless I
 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.499
so it doesn't affect me at all unless I
have really a lot of it but for people

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:30.509
have really a lot of it but for people
 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:32.840
have really a lot of it but for people
who are sensitive to caffeine they know

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850
who are sensitive to caffeine they know
 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.760
who are sensitive to caffeine they know
it they know that if they eat something

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770
it they know that if they eat something
 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.069
it they know that if they eat something
that's got caffeine in it they get jumpy

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079
that's got caffeine in it they get jumpy
 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.590
that's got caffeine in it they get jumpy
and shaky and they don't like the way it

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600
and shaky and they don't like the way it
 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.590
and shaky and they don't like the way it
feels so they cut back on it but if

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600
feels so they cut back on it but if
 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.810
feels so they cut back on it but if
you're not really consuming huge

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820
you're not really consuming huge
 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.610
you're not really consuming huge
quantities it doesn't have very much of

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620
quantities it doesn't have very much of
 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.529
quantities it doesn't have very much of
it in fact I don't think it's so good

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539
it in fact I don't think it's so good
 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.349

for kids and certainly teachers in

00:00:51.349 --> 00:00:51.359
for kids and certainly teachers in
 

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:54.079
for kids and certainly teachers in
school complain a lot that if the kids

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:54.089
school complain a lot that if the kids
 

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:56.239
school complain a lot that if the kids
are highly caffeinated they're bouncing

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:56.249
are highly caffeinated they're bouncing
 

00:00:56.249 --> 00:00:58.309
are highly caffeinated they're bouncing
off the walls and it makes it harder for

00:00:58.309 --> 00:00:58.319
off the walls and it makes it harder for
 

00:00:58.319 --> 00:01:00.829
off the walls and it makes it harder for
the kids to concentrate and harder for

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:00.839
the kids to concentrate and harder for
 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:03.829
the kids to concentrate and harder for
them to do their work so that would be

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:03.839
them to do their work so that would be
 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:06.320
them to do their work so that would be
the main thing but what really bothers

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330
the main thing but what really bothers
 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.719
the main thing but what really bothers
me about it is it's not labeled I think

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729
me about it is it's not labeled I think
 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.520
me about it is it's not labeled I think
it ought to be labeled on food products

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530
it ought to be labeled on food products
 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.560
it ought to be labeled on food products
and on drinks so then people have a

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570
and on drinks so then people have a
 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:13.940
and on drinks so then people have a
choice right now they don't have a

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950
choice right now they don't have a
 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.340

fat or carbohydrate will give you energy
 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.330
fat or carbohydrate will give you energy
you want fast energy than that's
