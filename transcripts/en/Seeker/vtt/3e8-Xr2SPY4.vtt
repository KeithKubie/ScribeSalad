00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:04.210
What if I told you that you not only inherited
your mother’s eyes or your dad’s chin

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:11.980
but you may have inherited your grandpa Bernard’s
stress?

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:15.539
Hey everyone it’s Natalia Reagan guest hosting
again for DNews!

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:16.619
Life.

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:17.699
Life isn’t easy.

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.869
And it appears that hardships from past generations
may have a lasting effects on future generations.

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:27.050
This idea that our current experiences, life
choices, and environment could directly affect

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.939
the genes of our descendents is called epigenetics.

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.190
And new research has found that the offspring
of Holocaust survivors have altered stress

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.190
hormones, or cortisol.

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:41.260
Cortisol is an adrenal hormone that helps
people cope with stress; A.K.A. maintain homeostasis.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.870
When an individual is stressed cortisol helps
regulate various changes in the body.

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.480
These changes include fluctuations in blood
sugar, immune responses, fat, protein, and

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.880
carbohydrates metabolism to maintain glucose,
blood pressure, anti-inflammatory actions,

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.100
and central nervous system activation.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.800
So, let’s just say, cortisol is an incredibly
important hormone in the body.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.620
So when researchers compared stress hormones
in Holocaust survivors to those in the Jewish

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.940
community who did not endure the Holocaust,
researchers discovered they had lower levels

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.390
of cortisol.

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.400
And those individuals who suffered from PTSD
had even lower levels of cortisol.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.460
Researchers also discovered the Holocaust
survivors were producing less of the enzyme

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.640
to break down cortisol which made sense given
that this allowed liver and kidney functions

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.880
to operate with lower glucose levels during
times of starvation -- something all too common

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.450
during the Holocaust and Nazi occupation.

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.140
Those who were younger during the Holocaust
had the lowest levels of cortisol and produced

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.120
the lowest amount of the enzyme to break it
down.

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.671
When researchers looked at cortisol levels
of the children of Holocaust survivors, they

00:01:40.671 --> 00:01:45.530
found something disturbing- like their parents,
the kids had lower levels of cortisol HOWEVER

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.270
they had higher than average levels of the
enzyme used to break it down.

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.420
In a typical pregnancy, the placenta has higher
levels of the cortisol busting enzyme to protect

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.480
the fetus, but if holocaust survivors had
lower levels of this enzyme that would mean

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.520
more cortisol would reach the fetus.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.369
So the fetus reacted by upping their enzyme
protection.

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:07.330
This made their offspring more likely suffer
from PTSD and susceptible to other illnesses

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.929
brought on by unmanaged stress such as hypertension
and obesity.

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:15.879
When researchers looked at the stress-related
gene and saw epigenetic tags were found in

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:18.609
both Holocaust survivors AND their offspring.

00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:22.250
This study is the first of its kind to discover
that someone’s stress and environment can

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.389
directly affect their children before they
were even conceived!

00:02:25.389 --> 00:02:29.219
These finding are revolutionary because it’s
been long accepted that DNA was the only way

00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:34.090
to transmit genetic information from generation
to generation, but research shows that the

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.371
environment indeed plays a role in modifying
genetic information as chemical tags attach

00:02:38.371 --> 00:02:42.549
to our DNA that serve to turn specific genes
and off.

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:46.980
Essentially, at the genetic level, our biology
is preparing our descendents to thrive in

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.269
the current environment- and in this particular
case it would have been the incredibly hostile

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:52.480
environment that was Holocaust.

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.830
This study isn’t the first time researchers
have looked at Holocaust survivors to understand

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.319
epigenetics.

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:01.760
Researchers have already discovered that stress
experienced while in utero can have lasting

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.689
effects on an individual’s health.

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:07.709
During the 1944 “Hunger Winter” in the
Netherlands, pregnant women experienced extreme

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.309
stress and starvation.

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:12.499
Their offspring were later studied and found
to have suffered from higher instances of

00:03:12.499 --> 00:03:17.689
diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease
than those born to mothers who had not endured

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:18.930
the “Hunger Winter”.

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.459
And girls born to women during or after the
“Hunger Winter” had an above average risk

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:24.279
of developing schizophrenia.

00:03:24.279 --> 00:03:28.659
The link between stress, cortisol levels,
disease, and its propensity to be passed down

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:32.829
to future generations illustrates that our
environment is far more significant when it

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:35.699
comes to our health and the health of our
offspring.

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:38.269
Similar studies have been carried out on mice.

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:43.569
Researchers exposed mice to the scent of cherry
blossoms with a simultaneous electric shock.

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:47.529
Mice were trained to fear the smell and their
offspring were found to ALSO fear the scent

00:03:47.529 --> 00:03:51.709
of cherry blossoms- they appeared to inherit
the memory AND fear.

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:55.010
This research, coupled with the the altering
of stress hormones in Holocaust survivors

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.150
and their descendents, means there is a great
deal to still learn about the science of epigenetics.

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:03.269
And with that goal in mind, here's a video
from Trace about how your Mom's stress could

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:19.659
be passed onto you.

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:22.759
So what kinds of stress will you pass on to
your future generations?
