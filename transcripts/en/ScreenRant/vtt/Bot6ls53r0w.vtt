00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:08.500
Every good superhero needs a villain just
as memorable, and oftentimes, writers don’t

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.940
look much farther than the hero’s immediate
family.

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.190
Those family bonds don’t always make the
jump from comic books to blockbuster films,

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.110
but these days, even casual comic fans will
be shocked to learn that even the most heroic

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:21.680
superheroes have a villain in their family
tree.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.669
Here are 10 Superheroes You Didn’t Know
Were Related to Villains.

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:28.460
Aquaman &amp; Ocean Master

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.430
Everyone knows Aquaman, the half-human, half-Atlantean
king, but his arch-enemy Ocean Master doesn't

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.030
get the same amount of fame.

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.170
His origin has changed over the years, but
whether it's the fully-human brother of Aquaman

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.600
building a helmet to let him breathe underwater
and rule Atlantis, or the fully-Atlantean

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.460
brother ruling with Aquaman's permission,
they may be the most complicated brothers

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.429
in DC's Universe.

00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:50.699
Cyclops &amp; Vulcan

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:56.250
The leader of the X-Men, Scott Summers a.k.a.
Cyclops is a household name - and thanks to

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.239
the modern X-Men movies, so is his brother
Alex a.k.a. Havok.

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.350
But it's the third Summers brother, Gabriel,
who is the real powerhouse.

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.020
Able to manipulate all forms of energy, and
ruling an alien race as emperor, his villain

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.729
alter ego Vulcan is one of the most powerful
mutants in the X-Men universe.

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:15.700
Professor X &amp; Juggernaut

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.090
The helmeted, hulking Juggernaut is hard to
forget, but most X-Men fans would never guess

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.270
that he's actually Professor X's brother.

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:23.659
Step-brother, to be exact.

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:27.729
Juggernaut actually made his debut in just
the 12th issue of the X-Men, where Charles

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:31.590
Xavier explained their childhood, when their
parents married after Xavier's father was

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.020
killed in a lab accident.

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:58.899
Kind of poetic though: one got the brains,
and 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:12.360
the other got the brawn.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.910
Supergirl &amp; Cyborg Superman

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.441
Classic comic book fans know the Cyborg Superman
as Hank Henshaw, but the character got a new

00:02:19.441 --> 00:02:25.190
origin in DC’s New 52 universe – as the
father of Supergirl, Kara Zor-El.

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.890
It turns out her father didn’t die on Krypton,
but wound up rescued by Brainiac – if you

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.210
can call being turned into a half-robot killing
machine a rescue.

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.070
Still, Superman’s powers and an arm that
can transform into nearly anything are more

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:38.640
of a gift than a curse.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.830
So there's someone in your chemistry class
that you're totally in love with.

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:43.970
Nightcrawler &amp; Mystique

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.760
Nightcrawler may be best known for his blue
skin and teleporting, but his parents are

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:49.760
the real bombshell.

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.690
It's a twist movie fans can enjoy too, since
his mother Mystique and father Azazel both

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.850
showed up in X-Men: First Class.

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.450
The movies stopped short of confirming the
pair would produce a son, but it hasn't been

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.540
a secret in the comics for years.

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.280
Batman &amp; Lincoln March

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.200
The New 52 dropped a huge twist on Bruce Wayne
when a mystery man arrived in the costume

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.870
of Court of Owls, bearing a serious grudge.

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.760
The man called himself Lincoln March, but
claimed Martha Wayne had been pregnant with

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.980
a second son born prematurely.

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.780
When the Waynes died, Thomas Wayne, Jr. was
lost to the system.

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.370
Lincoln was defeated, but Batman was unable
to tell if it was all madman's story... or

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:32.319
the truth, since his parents DID give him
a brother who died hours later, officially.

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:33.600
Superboy &amp; Lex Luthor

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.890
The Man of Steel and his arch-enemy aren't
known for building things together, but Superboy

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.000
is the exception.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.950
While originally introduced as a clone designed
to LOOK like Superman, later comics would

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.690
reveal that Kon-El, the clone Superboy was
actually a hybrid.

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:51.260
Scientists couldn't clone Kryptonian DNA,
so they blended Superman's with, you guessed

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:52.510
it, Lex Luthor.

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:57.190
Superboy and Lex would fight eventually, making
it a seriously weird case of the son rebelling

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:04.510
against the father.

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.580
Batgirl &amp; Jim Gordon, Jr.

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:10.870
Commissioner Gordon became an integral part
of the Batman Family when his daughter, Barbara,

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:11.870
became Batgirl.

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.350
But Jim Gordon’s other child, James Gordon,
Jr., is just as important… since he turned

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:19.100
out as villainous as Barbara is a hero.

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.370
Growing into a serial killer and trying to
poison all of Gotham’s newborns, James wound

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.710
up in prison – and eventually even a member
of DC’s Suicide Squad.

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.289
The Flash &amp; Cobalt Blue

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:34.479
The last thing Barry Allen needs is more tragedy,
but the night he was born, he was actually

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:36.410
one of two identical twin boys.

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:41.120
When a drunk doctor failed to deliver another
baby alive, he swapped Barry’s twin out

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.270
so neither couple left emptyhanded.

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:47.199
That twin would grow up to be Malcom Thawne,
the villain known as Cobalt Blue.

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:50.889
Wally West ended up defeating him, but it
was Malcolm Thawne’s descendant Eobard who

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:53.150
would take his revenge on Barry, centuries
into the future.

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:54.150
Scarlet Witch &amp; Magneto

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:55.150
She's been a comic book mainstay of the Avengers
for years, but Marvel's movie universe brought

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:56.150
Scarlet Witch and her brother Quicksilver
to the attention of the entire world.

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:57.150
Due to studio rights issues, Marvel needed
to rewrite their origins - in the original

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:58.150
comics, they weren't test subjects, but mutants.

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:59.150
Mutants who got their genetic gifts from their
father: Magneto, the X-Men's most famous villain.

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:00.150
So if Fox and Disney ever cross over their
franchises... things are going to get awkward.

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:01.150
Those are the cases of superheroes and villains
sharing a family link that we could find,

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:02.150
but which ones have we missed?

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:06.639
