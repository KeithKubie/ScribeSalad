00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:00.660
 MATTEO VALLONE: My name is Matteo Vallone. 

00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.690
 Is a member of the application and game business development team 

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:07.200
 My daily work is 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.014
 Deal with app and game developers 

00:00:08.014 --> 00:00:10.180
 So I want to be an app developer 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:13.250
 Everyone should be interested to learn more 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:15.150
 What are the success of successful game developers? 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:21.660
 In addition, I will try to sum up 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.550
 Several rules that apply to your daily work 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.590
 I will give an example 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.470
 How application developers use these rules 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.160
 But before that, I want to take a moment to talk 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.490
 Why do we think games and apps 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:40.670
 Need to learn from each other 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.250
 What do the two have in common? 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.500
 But I don't want to take a sentence 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.110
 In fact, I hope to solve this problem that cannot be ignored immediately. 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.770
 Making money through apps is much harder than making money through games. 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:51.820
 Everyone knows this. 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.100
 This is not only because 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.810
 People are more likely to accept paid games 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.610
 Also because the game's profit mechanism is more flexible 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:01.160
 Content and services provided 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.480
 Can actually guide users to consume 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.621
 The game can also sell virtual goods 

00:01:05.621 --> 00:01:06.995
 Therefore, they can sell content 

00:01:06.995 --> 00:01:08.820
 And priced price 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.606
 There are infinite possibilities 

00:01:10.606 --> 00:01:11.980
 So basically 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.280
 Can be in the game in various ways 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.260
 Sell ​​virtual currency or virtual goods 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.830
 For applications, this is impossible 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.450
 But the mathematical principles are the same 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.180
 For apps and games 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.260
 Leading mode is free value-added mode 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.770
 This means that the equation on the right is always true. 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.170
 CPI is the cost per install for users to install your app. 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.610
 This fee should always be lower than the user you are attracted to. 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.260
 Life cycle value 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.770
 That is 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.630
 When the CPI rises, the reason is 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.680
 When service capabilities and user acquisition are more competitive 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.220
 If you want this equation to be true 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.010
 You must pay more attention to the right term of the equation. 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.160
 Life cycle value is retention and engagement 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.440
 Conversion rate and profitability function 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.110
 But all factors are based on the retention rate 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.210
 Because it’s the retention rate that brings the degree of engagement. 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:09.630
 It can measure engagement 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.620
 And help to make money 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.800
 Therefore, retention is the most critical 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.800
 This data from the mobile intelligence company Quetra 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.200
 Explain why retention is so important for apps and games 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.640
 This is based on the Google Play Store rankings 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.710
 Rendered application user retention curve comparison 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:33.640
 You can see the retention rate of higher ranked games and apps. 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.190
 Be higher than lower ranked games and apps 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.710
 Although the curves on both sides are slightly different 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:45.520
 The retention period of the game is usually shorter 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.140
 Because the game's life is shorter than the application 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.080
 This is generally the case 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.100
 Therefore, not only game developers should pay attention to retention rate. 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.420
 Application developers should also pay attention to 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.120
 Let me further introduce the retention rate. 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.380
 Frequency is a key indicator you need to focus on when you try to increase your long-term retention rate 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:09.580
 Because this indicator shows 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.610
 The number of times users have used your app 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.050
 If users frequently visit your app 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.030
 Said they might like to use your app very much 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.656
 They will integrate your app into their daily lives. 

00:03:18.656 --> 00:03:20.030
 This means that these users have survived 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.790
 They may always use your app 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.500
 This image shows various apps and game categories. 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.500
 Data presented by two indicators 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:33.780
 One of the indicators is the frequency of each week. 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.510
 Indicates the average number of times the user has used the app per week 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.030
 Another indicator is the 90-day retention period, which is the long-term retention rate. 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.830
 I have shown the tail of this curve before. 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:45.120
 As you can see, although the data varies by category. 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.710
 But no matter which category 

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:51.460
 There is a direct correlation between these two indicators. 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:52.550
 All in all, retention is critical 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:55.120
 Game developers know this very well 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.760
 They will spend a lot of time optimizing the game to improve retention 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.130
 Everyone can see [inaudible] 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:06.960
 You will find that every successful game developer is very similar 

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:10.560
 Here are some highlights 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.360
 They release new games before the public 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.190
 Often will be tested first 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.170
 They will choose a test market or choose a beta test community 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:21.800
 They will spend a lot of time optimizing the game 

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.010
 Make various adjustments 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:25.930
 Until a satisfactory retention rate is obtained 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.690
 And this process needs a lot of screening 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.830
 Many games have died in the process. 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.690
 However, this also ensures the developer 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:38.040
 Put resources into the right products that really have the chance to succeed 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.380
 And the equation I showed before can be established. 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.460
 Suitable product 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.570
 If you did not pre-test the release 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:49.510
 Easily measure retention by Google Analytics 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:51.050
 Everyone can be at the top of this picture 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:54.040
 See retention curve 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.220
 This is the application retention curve 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.900
 In addition, it also shows 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.180
 Retention data broken down by user group installed on the same day 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:09.100
 So you can also optimize to see how it affects retention. 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.600
 All right 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.016
 Let's talk about it now. 

00:05:12.016 --> 00:05:17.040
 What rules can you draw from the game field and apply to your daily work? 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.990
 First, focus on the period of rapid decline in engagement. 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:22.440
 This rule is very important 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:26.100
 I will show you the retention rate data chart again. 

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:29.370
 Because there are some notable things in it. 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:33.070
 Everyone can see, no matter in which case 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:36.610
 No matter how successful the application is 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:38.900
 Most users will lose in the first 7 days 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.910
 This is the time period for all apps to drain users. 

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:43.940
 In fact, higher ranked apps 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:45.940
 Is the application with slow user loss 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:47.700
 Especially in the first 7 days 

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:50.970
 After 7 days, the trend of the retention rate curve tends to stabilize 

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:53.680
 The difference between the applications is not big 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.760
 But the first 7 days are crucial 

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:59.200
 You can see the average retention rate on the 7th day on the right. 

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.240
 That is after the first 7 days 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:04.030
 The average number of users in different categories of apps is still using the app 

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:06.930
 These are the data from Quetra 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:11.380
 You can see that the retention rate ranges from 40% to 15%. 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:16.640
 This means an average of 60% to 85% of users 

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.680
 Will be lost in the first 7 days 

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:22.050
 This is because the user has a trial process 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:24.730
 They will install a lot of apps and try them one by one. 

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:26.480
 After the first few days 

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.510
 They will really decide to continue using 

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:30.410
 Still on the shelf 

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:33.150
 If the app is good enough 

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:34.990
 Then the user is likely to decide to continue using 

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:37.860
 This is why the curve stays stable afterwards. 

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:40.910
 But the first 7 days are crucial 

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:42.330
 Game developers know this very well 

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:44.730
 Getting started with a new game is a very challenging thing for a game. 

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:48.310
 You must tell the user new rules, new ways to play 

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:51.280
 Reasons for concern, storyline, etc. 

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:52.740
 All this must start with the tutorial 

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:56.150
 I want to show you a video. 

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:58.470
 This is our recent and very successful game developer Pixelberry. 

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:02.810
 Their game tutorials have a very high full view rate 

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:05.620
 Among the users who started the tutorial 

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:09.130
 70% of users have actually finished 

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:10.190
 Every part of the tutorial 

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:12.424
 Let's play this video we [inaudible] 

00:07:12.424 --> 00:07:13.090
 [play video] 

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:14.850
 - Player enters the game 

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:16.420
 We immediately tell them stories 

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:19.120
 And we try to use one 

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:20.450
 a more natural way to tell 

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:23.030
 We know that many players who play games on their phones 

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:26.200
 May not want to read too much text 

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:29.680
 So we try to make players feel relaxed and natural in the process. 

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:32.220
 However, after they have finished watching the tutorial 

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:33.710
 We hope they have already 

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:35.240
 Fully attracted to these characters 

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:37.050
 Then they want to learn more about the story background of these characters. 

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:38.190
 And what is going on 

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:40.540
 I think let the user in the game 

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:41.980
 It’s very important to feel that you are making progress 

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:43.860
 Especially in mobile games 

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:45.982
 Because I think for many games 

00:07:45.982 --> 00:07:47.940
 As long as the player repeats the same operation 

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:49.312
 Can reach a certain level 

00:07:49.312 --> 00:07:51.770
 And the player wants to be less boring 

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:55.050
 I think storytelling is a great way to make players feel special. 

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:56.970
 You can say too good to the player, and another bad guy needs you to solve it. 

00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:59.227
 Or, now there is a new question waiting for you to deal with 

00:07:59.227 --> 00:07:59.810
 [End of video playback] 

00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:02.412
 MATTEO VALLONE: Two key aspects are mentioned in the video 

00:08:02.412 --> 00:08:03.120
 One of them is a story 

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:05.460
 Game developers use stories to immediately engage players 

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:07.870
 They rely on the narrative of the storyline 

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:11.690
 Attract users to stick to the full tutorial 

00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:13.917
 On the other hand, advanced 

00:08:13.917 --> 00:08:15.500
 Advanced is very important in the game 

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:18.390
 Everyone can think about it 

00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:19.490
 If the game continues to present new challenges to you 

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:21.270
 If you feel that you are making progress 

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:22.690
 You will continue to play 

00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:24.210
 Otherwise it will feel very boring 

00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:26.232
 These challenges should not be too difficult 

00:08:26.232 --> 00:08:27.440
 Otherwise you will leave the game 

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:29.190
 Therefore, you should always find a clever balance between the two. 

00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:33.470
 Let players be willing to continue the next challenge 

00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:35.870
 But the challenge is not too difficult 

00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:38.810
 I also want to show you another example. 

00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:40.640
 In addition to the tutorial, this advanced and novice concept is how it works elsewhere. 

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:43.220
 This example is about 

00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:45.350
 Another very successful game developer, Playdots 

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:47.950
 This chart shows the card data for their game. 

00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:49.660
 This is the data presented by the two indicators. 

00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:53.000
 One is the income of each player at the corresponding level. 

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.660
 The other is the churn rate, which means how many people left the game at the corresponding level. 

00:08:56.660 --> 00:09:01.410
 By adjusting the difficulty level of the level below the red line and after the player experience 

00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:04.710
 For those poorly performing levels 

00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:08.380
 They not only managed to increase the retention rate 

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:11.280
 Also increased the average revenue per paying user 

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:13.710
 Therefore, the information conveyed by this chart 

00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:15.620
 Of course, it’s specifically for games. 

00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:18.110
 The message is that this is not just about tutorials. 

00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:20.560
 It’s also about how to be in the whole game. 

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:24.680
 Present and cultivate advanced feelings 

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:30.725
 Ok, let's try to summarize some rules that apply to the application. 

00:09:30.725 --> 00:09:34.060
 the most important point is 

00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:35.720
 There will be a sharp decline in interaction in the first 7 days. 

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:37.700
 First, the user is exposed to a new application. 

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:41.000
 They must know how to use it before they start using it. 

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.220
 And understand the value of the app 

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:44.640
 You want to minimize the degree of decline in engagement 

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:47.060
 Help them stay through these 7 days 

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:51.290
 Until they may continue to use your app 

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:52.970
 So the first thing to find 

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:55.850
 Can provide value to users 

00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:58.220
 But they don’t have too many features for them. 

00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:02.450
 That is, the features that you can experience immediately after you show them to users. 

00:10:02.450 --> 00:10:04.790
 Then you need to understand 

00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:05.290
 The time to attract users 

00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:08.630
 In order for users to fully experience your app 

00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:10.430
 What key operations do you need users to perform? 

00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:12.960
 And this requires users to engage in some interaction and input. 

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:16.020
 For example, create an account, upload a video 

00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:18.990
 Find friends, add some personal preferences 

00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:22.880
 That is, some content that can make the experience more personalized and deeper. 

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:25.540
 But also requires the user to complete certain operations. 

00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:27.950
 You should gradually show these to users. 

00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:30.300
 You should help the user step by step 

00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:33.470
 Complete each operation 

00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:36.510
 Instead of having them do all the work at the same time 

00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:38.510
 therefore 

00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:41.430
 You should also manage how users are presented. 

00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:43.450
 Especially in the first few days 

00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:46.500
 You don't want to scare them off with these requirements. 

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:49.130
 Or let them feel overwhelmed 

00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:51.140
 This is the basic rule 

00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:53.470
 You can pass this rule 

00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:57.150
 Use in conjunction with user flow reporting in Google Analytics 

00:10:57.150 --> 00:10:58.150
 To optimize your app 

00:10:58.150 --> 00:11:01.090
 This chart shows when users use your app 

00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:03.940
 Switch between different screens 

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:05.770
 You can see their activity path 

00:11:05.770 --> 00:11:08.100
 More importantly, according to these red lines 

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:12.272
 You can see where the user left the app. 

00:11:12.272 --> 00:11:13.480
 What are the obstacles? 

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:14.640
 What are the obstacles? 

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:17.830
 Then, if possible, take steps to eliminate certain obstacles and obstacles. 

00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:19.900
 So, this is a very useful report. 

00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:24.050
 I want to give you an example. 

00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:26.930
 The developer of this app recently redesigned the starter process 

00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:29.030
 Good use of these rules 

00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:33.260
 Overall, their retention rate on day 7 increased by 20%. 

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:35.030
 This effect is very good 

00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:37.900
 How did they do it? 

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:39.710
 First, let’s talk about dating sites and apps. 

00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:42.490
 Users need to make a lot of settings for the dating app first. 

00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:46.044
 Then you can really use the app and enjoy it. 

00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:48.040
 User needs to create an account 

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:49.831
 Provide some personal information of your own 

00:11:49.831 --> 00:11:52.750
 Answer some personal questions 

00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:55.600
 Pay attention to some people, upload photos, etc. 

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:59.470
 Users need to do a lot of things to actually use the app. 

00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:03.080
 Developers redesigned their novice getting started process 

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:04.330
 Make it more natural and smooth, step by step 

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:06.210
 I will explain to you specifically. 

00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:08.250
 First of all, this is the interface before they redesigned. 

00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:10.910
 Ask the user to write a paragraph to introduce themselves 

00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:14.080
 Upload a photo and answer some questions 

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:16.300
 Pay attention to some people 

00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:18.830
 All of these operations are done in the same section of the app. 

00:12:18.830 --> 00:12:20.860
 These operations are displayed in a set of modal windows and there is no clear order 

00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:23.622
 Therefore, the user may feel a bit overwhelmed as if it were this feeling, God. 

00:12:23.622 --> 00:12:26.080
 I have to do so many things. 

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:26.950
 To use this app 

00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:28.820
 You can look at the right side. 

00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:30.160
 This interface just asks the user to answer the question. 

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:32.390
 Even if the user performs one of the tasks 

00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:36.440
 I feel very stressed because it doesn't look so attractive. 

00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:38.840
 And you have to do a lot of things 

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:41.250
 This is the interface after redesign 

00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:44.220
 After the user downloads the app 

00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:47.110
 The first thing I see is 5 questions about myself. 

00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:48.700
 Very easy to complete 

00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:51.180
 The answer is yes, that is, swipe right 

00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:52.400
 The answer is no, ie swipe left 

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:53.960
 After completing this item 

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:56.540
 The app will then ask the user to upload a photo. 

00:12:56.540 --> 00:12:58.450
 If you don't want to upload photos, you can skip this step 

00:12:58.450 --> 00:13:00.710
 This means users don’t upload photos. 

00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:02.170
 Can also use the app smoothly 

00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:04.830
 But users only need to pay attention to this point. 

00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:07.590
 After that, users can start enjoying the app. 

00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:10.020
 In addition, the system will also remind users 

00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:11.590
 Need to complete other operations 

00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:14.870
 To fully experience this app, these are just call-to-action 

00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:16.577
 Users can do these operations whenever they need them. 

00:13:16.577 --> 00:13:17.910
 Again, these operations are step by step. 

00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:21.080
 The user will not be reminded to proceed to the next operation after completing an operation. 

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:25.850
 It starts with a small number of interactive, easy-to-finish tasks 

00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:29.530
 And once the user actually starts using the app 

00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:30.530
 Then transition to more complex interactions and operations 

00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:36.590
 Now the user has decided to continue using the app. 

00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:38.952
 You are creating a smooth beginner experience 

00:13:38.952 --> 00:13:40.035
 And done very well in terms of the sense of advancement 

00:13:40.035 --> 00:13:42.820
 Let's discuss how to make a profit now. 

00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:46.560
 I want to talk about how the game is profitable. 

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:51.380
 Even the most successful game, no matter how hard 

00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:53.300
 There will still be a large number of users 

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:54.700
 Never spend a penny in the game 

00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:58.440
 Game developers also recognize this 

00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:01.846
 The key solution is to determine as soon as possible 

00:14:01.846 --> 00:14:03.470
 Users who are more likely to spend in the game 

00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:05.060
 Then start targeting this part of the user 

00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:08.370
 Even after this, after identifying the users who are actually planning to spend, 

00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:10.630
 Also need to know how much they are willing to spend 

00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:14.380
 This is really important 

00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:17.340
 Because different users have different buying tendencies 

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:20.370
 Therefore, compared to providing unified content to all users 

00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:22.470
 Targeted different users to different experiences or different products 

00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:27.930
 Can get much better results 

00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:30.560
 I want to give you an example that is very successful in this regard. 

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:33.480
 Space Ape, this is a very successful game developer. 

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:36.430
 Their games include "The Samurai Siege" and "The Country of Competition: The Age of Destruction" 

00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:40.280
 The approach they take is 

00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:44.450
 Segment users based on their behavior for the first 7 days 

00:14:44.450 --> 00:14:46.520
 They are based on how each user interacts with the game. 

00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:50.240
 Calculate and predict the lifetime value of users 

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:53.380
 In addition, they also based on different consumption patterns of users in the game. 

00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:56.520
 And tag users by way of payment and purchase of equipment 

00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:58.260
 Then they started using different kits 

00:14:58.260 --> 00:14:59.760
 Target these users 

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:02.332
 Let me show you the actual situation below. 

00:15:02.332 --> 00:15:03.290
 Here are all users 

00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:05.990
 They are entering the Space Ape server 

00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:08.180
 Space Ape starts analyzing them 

00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:10.210
 Then assign them to a segment. 

00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:11.910
 They have 5 segments 

00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:14.370
 I will show only two of these segments to illustrate 

00:15:14.370 --> 00:15:17.555
 Based on the prediction that one of the segments has medium lifecycle value 

00:15:17.555 --> 00:15:18.930
 Its consumption pattern is 

00:15:18.930 --> 00:15:24.650
 These users spend a lot in a single purchase 

00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:28.800
 But they won’t buy in large quantities very often 

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:31.800
 Another segment has a higher lifetime value 

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:33.690
 But these users spend less on a single purchase. 

00:15:33.690 --> 00:15:36.860
 Despite the predictions, these users have changed over time 

00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:40.290
 Will spend more money in the game but they tend to spend less on a single purchase 

00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:42.470
 And the frequency of purchase is very high 

00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:44.670
 Therefore, developers will provide different equipment for different users. 

00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:47.820
 A single amount is higher but 

00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:50.390
 Medium lifecycle value user group with lower frequency of purchase 

00:15:50.390 --> 00:15:54.470
 I will see a big kit that contains a lot of equipment. 

00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:56.040
 The price is quite expensive 

00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:57.770
 However, after they buy it once 

00:15:57.770 --> 00:15:58.820
 May not buy again in the future 

00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:01.470
 They will use these equipment during the rest of the game. 

00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:06.720
 A user group with a medium amount of single spending will see a smaller kit and the price is cheaper. 

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:10.090
 However, they may come back to buy more equipment. 

00:16:10.090 --> 00:16:11.580
 The effectiveness of this approach is very significant 

00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:15.350
 If you want to summarize a rule that applies to the application domain 

00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:19.300
 First of all, you must realize 

00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:21.209
 Different users have different needs for your application 

00:16:21.209 --> 00:16:23.250
 Especially their values 

00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:25.870
 And consumption trends are different 

00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:28.700
 If you can distinguish between these users 

00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:33.049
 And use different equipment packages tailored to user values ​​and consumer preferences to locate them. 

00:16:33.049 --> 00:16:35.340
 Can more effectively optimize app conversions 

00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:43.620
 You can use a tool to understand your users 

00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:46.200
 Understand the behavior of different segments 

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:48.170
 And think about what you can do 

00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:51.420
 The tool that really makes a user-friendly experience is Google Analytics. 

00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:53.520
 This is the segment generation tool in Google Analytics. 

00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:57.410
 There are many options to create different segments. 

00:16:57.410 --> 00:16:59.770
 I want to show you something. 

00:16:59.770 --> 00:17:01.120
 The "behavior" category option 

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:04.690
 There are "sessions" and "days from the last session" 

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:07.010
 "Number of transactions" and "session duration" 

00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:09.589
 You can create segments based on these metrics. 

00:17:09.589 --> 00:17:11.500
 For example, there are two groups here. 

00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:13.960
 One group is a user with high degree of interaction 

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:15.410
 The other group is users with lower levels of interaction. 

00:17:15.410 --> 00:17:18.660
 Almost every report in Google Analytics 

00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:21.560
 Will show these segments 

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:23.440
 For example, this is the income report 

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:25.589
 As you can see, there is not only one line of income data here. 

00:17:25.589 --> 00:17:28.060
 But the income of users with higher levels of interaction 

00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:29.541
 And the revenue of users with lower engagement 

00:17:29.541 --> 00:17:31.790
 So you can really start to understand the user’s behavior 

00:17:31.790 --> 00:17:36.200
 And the basis for grouping each segment. 

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:38.250
 In the field of application 

00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:40.420
 In locating different users with different value propositions 

00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:41.410
 The more successful one is Wish. 

00:17:41.410 --> 00:17:42.920
 This is an e-commerce application 

00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:44.750
 Very simple, developers divide users into two groups 

00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:47.820
 One group is a less interactive user and the other is a more interactive user. 

00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:49.924
 Developers are less engaged users 

00:17:49.924 --> 00:17:51.340
 Recommended product packages are cheaper 

00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:53.730
 Because users are really considering buying these items 

00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:57.890
 Less investment and interaction required 

00:17:57.890 --> 00:18:01.630
 Once the developer sees the user has more interaction and some conversions 

00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:04.260
 They started recommending more expensive items. 

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:07.440
 This is very simple 

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:08.370
 But it really increased the conversion rate by 10%. 

00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:16.820
 The last rule I want to introduce is 

00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:17.980
 Find the right time, aim to 

00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:21.920
 This rule says that the way goods are sold is more important than the goods themselves. 

00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:24.610
 Please take a look at the screenshot of Pretty Simple. 

00:18:24.610 --> 00:18:28.980
 This is another game developer Pretty Simple Games 

00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:31.500
 They not only did the science design of the game but also did some artistic processing. 

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:34.780
 I want to give you an example. 

00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:37.280
 How does this approach achieve optimization? 

00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:38.970
 When we discussed the advanced chart before 

00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:42.680
 Example developer Playdots 

00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:45.770
 They also redesigned 

00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:48.170
 Purchase process for the entire game 

00:18:48.170 --> 00:18:51.090
 Overall, revenue per active user increased by 10% 

00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:54.459
 Is indeed a very amazing number 

00:18:54.459 --> 00:18:57.000
 Because this is a count for all users, including those who have not purchased the item. 

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.300
 So overall, a 10% increase in revenue per user is pretty good. 

00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:05.820
 I will give you two examples to illustrate their practices. 

00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:09.370
 An example is before the player starts entering the level. 

00:19:09.370 --> 00:19:13.120
 They will see a card showing the skills they currently have. 

00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:15.110
 In addition, it will also prompt the player to buy 

00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:16.730
 Items that may be needed in the level 

00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:18.030
 It does not display the entire store's merchandise 

00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:21.020
 And just prompt the player to buy the specific items they might need in the level. 

00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:24.640
 In this example, it is the treasure chest. 

00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:27.600
 Similarly, when the player fails to clear the customs 

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:30.900
 Generally speaking, all mobile opportunities have been used up. 

00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:33.320
 They will first see a button 

00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:36.590
 Let them buy additional mobile opportunities to complete the level 

00:19:36.590 --> 00:19:39.092
 They don’t have to start from scratch 

00:19:39.092 --> 00:19:40.550
 Return to the store to buy mobile opportunities 

00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:43.760
 Instead, you can buy it now and continue playing it. 

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:47.160
 By this practice developers get 6% more paid users 

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:50.925
 They just added these two call-to-action phrases. 

00:19:50.925 --> 00:19:53.050
 Another example is that they are in the process of playing 

00:19:53.050 --> 00:19:55.960
 Added some in-app products 

00:19:55.960 --> 00:20:01.500
 So they not only show goods in the store 

00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:05.190
 Also highlight the product with a button in the game 

00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:07.384
 As long as the player has a need during the game 

00:20:07.384 --> 00:20:09.050
 Buy with just one tap 

00:20:09.050 --> 00:20:13.010
 This approach increases ARPU by 5% 

00:20:13.010 --> 00:20:17.410
 Summarize the above practices 

00:20:17.410 --> 00:20:20.670
 That is, we must also find the right time in the application, and we have targeted 

00:20:20.670 --> 00:20:26.230
 This is more than just making it easy for users to buy 

00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:30.710
 That is, as much as possible without affecting their experience. 

00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:32.840
 Users only need to tap once or twice to complete the purchase 

00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:36.260
 Also in the specific product that you sell with you 

00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:39.260
 Extremely relevant time and location 

00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:41.780
 Trigger call-to-action 

00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:45.280
 What is more successful in this area of ​​application is TomTom. 

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:47.790
 They recently switched from a paid model to a freemium model. 

00:20:47.790 --> 00:20:51.900
 As a result, paying users increased by 2.4 times 

00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:55.380
 This is due to the adoption of appropriate transformation methods. 

00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:57.400
 They carefully thought about their business model 

00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:00.790
 And how to be wise 

00:21:00.790 --> 00:21:02.042
 Upgrade to paid mode 

00:21:02.042 --> 00:21:03.000
 I will show you how they did it. 

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:07.490
 The specific mode is that users can get 75 kilometers of navigation mileage for free. 

00:21:07.490 --> 00:21:09.270
 Users can use this app to navigate 75 km 

00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:10.790
 Without paying any fees 

00:21:10.790 --> 00:21:15.140
 This is an actual distance measurement mode 

00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:19.190
 Then the user can upgrade to one or three years 

00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:20.490
 Subscriber 

00:21:20.490 --> 00:21:22.560
 The first thing they do is 

00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:25.350
 Always show upgrade button in app 

00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:26.601
 The button is at the bottom of the app 

00:21:26.601 --> 00:21:28.350
 No matter which interface of the app you can see 

00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:29.130
 Users just tap 

00:21:29.130 --> 00:21:30.950
 You can upgrade 

00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:33.890
 Moreover, users can also see countdown miles to know their remaining free kilometers 

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:37.410
 They will see that the number of miles is decreasing, 75, 74, 73 

00:21:37.410 --> 00:21:40.529
 They know when they need to click the upgrade button at the bottom. 

00:21:40.529 --> 00:21:43.070
 On the other hand, the app developer’s approach is very similar to another example I showed before. 

00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:45.970
 They will be at a very relevant moment 

00:21:45.970 --> 00:21:47.180
 Trigger some call-to-action 

00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:49.430
 For example, if the user starts a new trip 

00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:50.930
 They know that users may run out of free kilometers 

00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:53.410
 Because this trip is very far 

00:21:53.410 --> 00:21:55.860
 Suppose the user has only 40 kilometers left 

00:21:55.860 --> 00:21:58.750
 They will trigger a call to action, which says 

00:21:58.750 --> 00:21:59.890
 Upgrade now? 

00:21:59.890 --> 00:22:01.480
 Upgrade now may be better 

00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:03.230
 Because users don't want to upgrade during driving 

00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:05.600
 Or the user may not have a network connection during the trip or the user is abroad. 

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:09.270
 Reasons like this 

00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:13.050
 They will also run out of users 

00:22:13.050 --> 00:22:15.230
 Or trigger a call to action when you have used up free kilometers 

00:22:15.230 --> 00:22:18.180
 But the important point is that these call-to-action phrases are highly correlated. 

00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:19.630
 So it’s very easy to let users upgrade 

00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:22.350
 Users also understand that they are at this moment 

00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:24.510
 Reasons for purchasing an upgrade service 

00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:27.640
 Ok, let me sum up, there are 3 rules in total. 

00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:32.300
 The first one is to solve the problem of the sharp decline in the interaction during the novice entry period. 

00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:37.090
 First use Google Analytics 

00:22:37.090 --> 00:22:40.170
 Analysis of retention data from day 1 to day 7 

00:22:40.170 --> 00:22:42.480
 Then think about the key moments that can drive users to gradually increase their input. 

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:44.430
 And think about how to introduce these moments into your app. 

00:22:44.430 --> 00:22:46.950
 The second is to make full use of the application 

00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:47.590
 Different user characteristics 

00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:50.120
 Understand the needs of different users 

00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:52.210
 You can target users in different ways. 

00:22:52.210 --> 00:22:55.710
 Especially in the provision of in-app products 

00:22:55.710 --> 00:22:56.920
 And for different buying preferences 

00:22:56.920 --> 00:23:00.450
 The third rule is how you sell goods. 

00:23:00.450 --> 00:23:01.880
 More important than the product itself 

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:03.960
 We call it 

00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:05.170
 Find the right time, aim to 

00:23:05.170 --> 00:23:09.570
 Not only makes it easy for users to buy, but also highly relevant 

00:23:09.570 --> 00:23:11.310
 When you think users are most likely to convert 

00:23:11.310 --> 00:23:16.550
 Trigger call-to-action 

00:23:16.550 --> 00:23:19.320
 thank you all!
