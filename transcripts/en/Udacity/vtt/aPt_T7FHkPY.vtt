00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.230
Let's start with use case diagrams. UML does not include OMT's data flow

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:11.840
diagram. Instead, it includes Jacobson's use case diagrams.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:17.430
A use case is a sequence of user-visible actions along with system responses.

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:23.330
It's a story of how the system deals with a particular user interaction.

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.760
Use cases are particularly useful for eliciting requirements.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.300
You lay out different stories of how the system is going to be used, and

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.820
then explore ramifications. What happens if something goes wrong,

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.180
what are some intermediate steps that maybe you didn't make explicit.
