DAVID THORBURN: I've thought
a lot about what it means

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.459
to lecture to undergraduates.

00:00:09.459 --> 00:00:11.250
One of the reasons I
thought a lot about it

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.750
was that the most inspiring
teachers I had as a student

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:16.390
were lecturers.

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.560
And as I become-- Both
at Yale and at MIT

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.780
I taught lecture courses.

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.490
And I became, I
think, good at them.

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:26.700
But I was never as
good as I wanted to be.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.720
And I think maybe one thing that
made me a good lecturer was I

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:30.670
was always nervous.

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.250
And even to this day, I've been
lecturing in the film course

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.710
now I think 38 or 39 years.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.290
I still get stage fright.

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.330
But I'm glad I do it because it
makes me live for the students.

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.100
I hated bad lectures.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.670
I thought they were the
pits of higher education.

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.590
And I swore to myself that
if I became a lecturer

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:55.810
I would never bore my students.

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:59.850
That was a worse sin
then almost any other

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.220
a teacher could commit
was to be boring.

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:09.259
And I have also felt
that, in recent years

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:10.800
especially, although
it's always been

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.870
an undercurrent in
education, there's

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.620
been a kind of growing
negative feeling

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.460
about lectures as if
they're herding students

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:20.980
into our herd experience.

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.090
And it doesn't give them
hands on experience.

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.230
And I think, intellectually,
that's a foolish perspective.

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:28.850
Professors no more
than students.

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.250
It's appropriate for students to
listen to professors sometime.

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.240
Professors should take
the responsibility

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.060
of when they talk to
students very seriously.

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:38.770
If they can present
the information

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.300
to students in ways that
are more effective on paper,

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:47.660
or on film, or in some other
format, on video disks,

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.930
or on computer disks
they should do so.

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.010
But if they take-- And
in a small classroom

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.330
they should certainly encourage
discussion and interaction.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.250
But I think surely there are
times and places, especially

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.420
in the humanities,
when it's perfectly

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.125
appropriate for a professor who
knows an immense amount more

00:02:06.125 --> 00:02:09.160
than the students to
present material that

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.570
has been synthesized
by the years of study

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.310
and understanding
that he or she has.

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.340
And the greatest experiences,
the most inspiring intellectual

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.390
experiences I had as an
undergraduate in college

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.000
were from lecturers.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.970
And I taught-- I
was very fortunate.

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.760
I went to a
wonderful university.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:30.750
Princeton.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.600
They had very small classes.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.970
I was in some
tutorials that, they

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.870
were called preceptorials,
that were seven

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.510
students and a full professor.

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.390
So I got the benefits of intense
one on one or close to one

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:43.860
on one attention.

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.380
And I loved those classes.

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.160
But the classes I had in
which they were 100 or 75

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.270
or 150 students listening
to a Professor of History,

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.230
or a Professor of Philosophy, or
a Professor of Literature talk

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.300
in the ways they did about
ideas, about the history

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.090
of ideas, about
the power of texts,

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.990
taught me what literature
is and taught me

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:08.370
what intellectual engagement
with literature should be.

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.030
And I swore to myself
that if I became a teacher

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.630
I would try to be a good
lecturer rather than a bad one.

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.270
So it seemed to me
as-- First of all,

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:25.450
as I thought about the
most inspiring lectures

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.850
that I had as an undergraduate.

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:29.660
It was one professor
I had especially.

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:30.670
He's now dead.

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.750
But he was a wonderfully
inspiring man.

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.840
Also became an
inspiring scholar who

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.840
didn't produce a lot of
work but his scholarship

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:39.790
was very productive.

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.840
And he was a department
chair who generated

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.189
a lot of colleagues work.

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:44.980
He was a great man.

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.980
His name was Lawrence Holland.

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.430
His book was called,
it was on Henry James,

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.750
it was called The
Expense of Spirit.

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.140
his lecture was on
American literature.

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:55.750
And a number of
us in that course

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.230
became Professors of Literature.

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.730
I'm thinking now who
I've state in touch with

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.919
and they're also teaching
or still teaching

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:04.710
around the country.

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:07.750
So Holland affected other
students as well as me.

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.140
And his strategy in
lectures I've tried to copy.

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:11.620
Or even plagiarize.

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.480
One thing he always did was
he presented an outline.

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.180
It was not the text
of the lecture.

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:23.170
But it was three or four
central digestible points

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:25.591
that organized the
lecture in sequence.

00:04:25.591 --> 00:04:28.090
He would give out mimeographed
sheet to each of his students

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:30.850
and you would follow along.

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:32.950
And sometimes under
each rubric there

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:35.930
might be one or two other sub
facts to help the student.

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.430
It didn't capture
the whole lecture.

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:42.020
But you could use that sheet
to organize your understanding

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.240
of the lecture.

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.390
I thought that was a
wonderfully helpful.

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:48.380
I found it wonderfully helpful.

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:49.684
Both for review.

00:04:49.684 --> 00:04:51.100
But also because
what it showed me

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.460
was that Professor Holland
had planned what he was doing.

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.560
That he was presenting
material to me

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.050
that he had thought
long about that

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.160
he organized in a serious way.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.440
But the second great thing
about Larry Holland's lectures

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.872
was that they were not
completely written out.

00:05:07.872 --> 00:05:09.830
There were parts of them
that were written out.

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:12.730
Very eloquent moments often
at the beginning at the end.

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:14.500
And I've sometimes
imitated that.

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.100
But the greatest
part of his lectures

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:18.890
were his lectures
seemed spontaneous.

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:21.090
Even though he was
following his lecture

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:23.560
it seemed as if he was not.

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.250
He was speaking to me.

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:27.040
And I tried to capture.

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:29.190
I've never been
as good as he was.

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:31.940
Another professor who did
this, but who read his lectures

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:34.220
and was theatrically
very powerful,

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:36.250
taught with me at Yale.

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:38.300
And it was Bart Giamatti
the man who became

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:41.101
the President of Baseball.

00:05:41.101 --> 00:05:42.850
First the President
of the American League

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:44.440
and then the
Commissioner of Baseball.

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:46.230
And he was a great teacher, too.

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:47.540
And a great lecturer.

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:48.980
But he wrote most of his out.

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:51.520
And he used to
practice his readings.

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.710
And I felt, even though
his lectures were great,

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:55.690
that they didn't match
what Holland did,

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:59.500
my undergraduate mentor,
because Holland seemed really

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:00.430
to be talking to me.

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:03.960
And yet when I, as a student,
looked at his outline

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:07.490
I realized that he'd given
me a brilliantly coherent--

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:08.940
That was my ideal.

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:12.070
I'm not sure I actually fully
ever realized the ideal.

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:15.842
And that may be part of the cost
you pay for not writing it out.

00:06:15.842 --> 00:06:17.300
Because what has
happened-- I mean,

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.060
I always give an
outline to my students.

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:20.780
And I try to follow the outline.

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:22.870
But I also try to
leave-- and I also plan

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:25.040
and I pick my details.

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.820
When I'm lecturing
in the film course

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:30.212
I create clips that I show
that I've sort of planned

00:06:30.212 --> 00:06:31.420
when I want to use the clips.

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:34.090
And they interrupt the
flow of my discourse.

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:36.020
So this first sequence,
it comes from Cops.

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:38.110
And in many ways I
think it embodies that,

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:40.580
kind of, a version
of the trajectory ,

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:42.950
or crescendo joke I was
talking about earlier.

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:45.270
It's a small version
of the cannon joke

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:47.011
that you see in,
or jokes plural,

00:06:47.011 --> 00:06:48.760
because there's another
joke with a cannon

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:52.150
in the second half of the film
that I've talked about earlier.

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:53.910
Let's show it Greg.

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:55.950
And of course this is
the moment where Keaton

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:57.609
is in flight from the police.

00:06:57.609 --> 00:06:58.650
The cops are chasing him.

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:00.890
He runs up this
teeter totter, right?

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:06.170
He runs up a ladder it turns
out to be like a seesaw.

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:07.800
But when I am at
my best I think I'm

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:14.650
doing something that can't
be captured in printed form.

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:16.820
Or couldn't be captured
if you gave students

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:19.370
a transcript of
what you had done.

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:21.650
Which is that I'm
modeling thinking.

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:25.250
I'm modeling how you
make connections.

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:28.590
I'm even modeling
discovery in a certain way.

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:29.990
Intellectual discovery.

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:32.470
Because by not actually
writing the words out

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:35.180
I sometimes bring the material
together in a different way.

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:38.040
And I do make discoveries
while I'm talking.

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:41.394
And that energizes me and
makes me more powerful.

00:07:41.394 --> 00:07:42.810
And I think that
was another thing

00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:44.130
that I got from Larry Holland.

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:47.780
I realized that another aspect
of what he was showing me

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:50.240
was how not just
intellectually engaged

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:54.920
but how passionately engaged,
how emotionally valuable

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:57.080
studying literature could be.

00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:01.204
And I tried in my lectures,
not exactly consciously

00:08:01.204 --> 00:08:03.370
because I think I absorbed
some of this unconscious.

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:06.270
Only in recent years that I've
thought about it abstractly

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:08.220
and I'm able to articulate it.

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:11.770
But I see now that
Lawrence Holland

00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:15.240
was a great-- I had other
great lecturers at Princeton.

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:16.360
He wasn't the only one.

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:19.960
But Holland was the one I
remember best and I admire

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:22.360
and I sometimes,
when I remember to do

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:24.550
this in the last lecture
of the film course,

00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:27.584
I pay respects to him.

00:08:27.584 --> 00:08:29.000
I'm getting
sentimental about him.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.260
I haven't seen him or talked
to him in 30, 40 years.

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:39.240
In a certain sense
that what I try

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:41.870
to tell the students about
what I do for the film courses

00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:42.370
is this.

00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:46.040
I want them to watch-- the
movie is the primary text.

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:48.050
And I see myself, in
some sense, as playing

00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:51.520
the role of a kind of
synthesizer or channel,

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:58.820
which tries to give a kind
of brief but extraordinarily

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:04.590
concise account or summary of
the best that has been said

00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:06.010
about this particular film.

00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:10.430
Or the best that has been said
about the historical processes

00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:12.280
that lead up to the
making of the film.

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:14.850
In other words, because I
don't expect my students

00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:17.920
to become film scholars
or literary scholars.

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:21.010
In my literature courses
I have the same ambition.

00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:24.960
I imagine that the kind
of student I want to reach

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:26.830
is that of a literate citizen.

00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:29.850
And I don't expect them to
have the kind of knowledge

00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:31.090
that a scholar what have.

00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:34.660
I try to play the role of
someone who synthesizes aspects

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:36.260
of the scholarship for them.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.420
And that's also another
reason why the lecture

00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:40.110
is what is important.

00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:41.680
Because I could
have the students

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:44.870
read five scholarly books
and synthesize them.

00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:47.180
But I do that for
them so that they

00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:48.642
have the time to
look at the film

00:09:48.642 --> 00:09:49.850
and think about it seriously.

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:57.190
The environment of the
classroom or the lecture room

00:09:57.190 --> 00:09:59.250
is a unique kind of community.

00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:01.520
It depends on certain
kinds of conventions

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:03.130
that everyone accepts.

00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:03.700
For example.

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:04.940
In the lecture students
know they're not

00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:06.220
supposed to raise
and interrupt you

00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:07.480
in the middle of your lecture.

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:10.800
And it's only a very
aggressive or arrogant student

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:11.890
who will do so.

00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:13.350
A good lecturer
will sometimes say,

00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:15.420
if you have questions
I'll make time at the end.

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:18.000
Or in my classes what I
try to do is say, look.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.100
I'm going to give the first
15 minutes of my lecture

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:23.370
next week to questions you
might have about anything.

00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:25.807
And I urge you to bring them up.

00:10:25.807 --> 00:10:27.890
You need to do that, I
think, if you're lecturing.

00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:30.870
You shouldn't ever-- In
my courses, of course,

00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:32.730
there's also, and I
think is critical.

00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:35.030
I don't believe in courses
that are only lecture.

00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:37.620
Even my course, which has
two hours of lecture a week,

00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:39.310
has one hour of discussion.

00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:40.000
Recitation.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.370
I think it's very
important for the students

00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:44.840
to take possession of the
ideas that you talk about.

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:47.900
I think that students
in a good class,

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:51.270
I think you do create a kind
of community of learning.

00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:52.830
A community of inquiry.

00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:55.750
It can be especially exciting
in a discussion class

00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:58.220
where you actually talk
about-- I try to tell students,

00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:00.400
you know, this is one of
the few places in which you

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:02.320
can get angry in a certain way.

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:05.840
And passionate in
disagreement with someone

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:07.517
and not offend them.

00:11:07.517 --> 00:11:09.850
And that's the most exciting
kind of class when you say,

00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:12.456
you know, you're completely
wrong about that passage.

00:11:12.456 --> 00:11:14.330
Knowing that the person
you're saying that to

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:15.120
won't be offended.

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:16.640
You're not attacking the person.

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:18.430
You're part of the
passionate discourse

00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:20.700
of trying to understand
the excitement of trying

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:21.950
to understand the text.

00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:25.920
Trying to understand what's
some writer or artist has done.

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:27.670
That can be so enlivening.

00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:32.924
And it can be truly a
deeply communal experience.

00:11:32.924 --> 00:11:35.340
It doesn't even work if it's
not, in some sense, communal.

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:38.490
So I think even in a lecture
there's a sense of interaction

00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:40.062
between you and your audience.

00:11:40.062 --> 00:11:42.020
And if your audience is
bored, if your audience

00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:44.400
is not listening,
if they go online

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:45.711
and start doing their homework.

00:11:45.711 --> 00:11:46.210
Right?

00:11:46.210 --> 00:11:49.470
Or their email.

00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:53.000
You're a bad teacher and
you shouldn't be doing it.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.060
If you're arrogant
enough to think

00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:58.060
that you want the
students to pay attention

00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:00.810
to you for 50 minutes
without interruption

00:12:00.810 --> 00:12:04.470
you better be organized
and you better be good.

00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:06.610
And I think a lot of
professors are not.

00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:10.430
And I think that they
dishonor my profession

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:11.180
when they do that.

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:15.930
I think we shouldn't have
lecturers who don't really

00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:17.290
do their job properly.

00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:22.080
But I think lecturers who do,
do a uniquely valuable job.

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:24.870
They model things for students
that they can't get themselves

00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:26.060
in discussion.

00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:27.980
They show what real
learning can be.

00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:32.030
And what passionate engagement
with learning can also be.

00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:33.830
And that's the kind
of defense I would

00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:40.140
give of the medium
of the live lecture.
