Um, I have a 69 Nova that they're building right now. I did something, I think I did. Yeah. And you, everything's like super new. It's, yeah. Yeah. I don't like old shit.

[inaudible] that's yours. Oh No, no. Well, yeah. Um, the yellow one I got from a guy who's a plastic surgeon and that was like his bottom of the line car, but he did everything to it. It's got the suspension and everything and that's a big difference. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I could try that thing anywhere. But the, uh, the black one for 27 try carb. It's old school, old school all the way and breaks. No, no, it's got this spray. Yeah. That's where you gotta draw the line. Yeah. Yeah. Got It. I gotta be able to stop. Gotta be able to stop it.

Yep. It's like either you like it or you don't like some people just like everything new and modern and shiny. Like when I started making money, I started buying older cars. I like older shit does have a different feel to them. Totally. Totally. Totally. I have a, uh, yeah. Yes. Is to trade his truck, man. What did I get this? I got that. Uh, probably six months ago. [inaudible]

Man, that truck looks like me. Bashed in windows. Shit's cars. I love it. I love you. Tried that around that motherfucker. You know what? I'm waiting there. I am going to get the body work done on that motherfucking because it's got some holes in it. Oh, it's pretty beat up. Yeah, it's pretty. I got to get the body though. There's something to that. When you look at those old cars, you realize that they don't make anything like this anymore. No Man, they didn't fit the style. Uh, they really put a lot into style. Carson 50s and 60s. Man do now, but it just doesn't seem the same look good. Like a new core Vat, like a 2019 corvette.

Speaker 1:          04:03          It's a beautiful car. But you look at that old truck, it does not have what that truck has. It's like you put it, it'll put a smile on your face. Just driving it, man. One of my biggest joys is it sitting behind the wheel at one of those old cars. Man. It just makes me, I feel like a young mother fucking when I'm sitting here like a kid. Yeah, yeah. Oh, like a ride. Like you drive it around the ride. It is, yeah. It's so much. You pull up to a stoplight, some mother fucking in the, the chronic, some guys give me a thumbs up and I be cheesing from ear to ear when that happens. And you don't even have to drive those fast. No. Yeah. Even that corvette, you don't have to. Every once in a while it's fun, you know, break them loose. It's a little funny to break them with, but yeah, you don't have to drive. Well for a power lifted though, it's almost like mandatory for you to have some sort of a muscle car. Yeah, I guess so. It's like, it goes with the territory, doesn't like a big block engine. There's, you know, somebody got a video of you driving by. Yeah. That's hilarious.
