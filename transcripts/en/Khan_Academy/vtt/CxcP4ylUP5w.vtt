00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.820
We're asked to factor 40c
to the third power minus 5d

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:06.324
to the third power.

00:00:06.324 --> 00:00:08.199
So the first thing that
might jump out at you

00:00:08.199 --> 00:00:10.770
is that 5 is a factor
of both of these terms.

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:16.470
I could rewrite this as 5
times 8c to the third power

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.890
minus 5 times d to
the third power.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.440
And so you could actually
factor out a 5 here,

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.560
so factor out a 5.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.200
And so if you
factor out a 5, you

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.770
get 5 times 8c to
the third power

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.670
minus d to the third power.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.150
So as you see,
factoring, it really

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.180
is just undistributing
the 5, reversing

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:41.930
the distributive property.

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:43.750
And when you write
it like this, it

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.190
might jump out at you
that 8 is a perfect cube.

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.740
It's 2 to the third power.
c to the third power

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.760
is obviously c to
the third power.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.477
And then you have d
to the third power.

00:00:52.477 --> 00:00:54.310
So this right here is
a difference of cubes.

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:56.200
And actually, let me
write that explicitly

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.550
because 8 is the same thing
as 2 to the third power.

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.150
So you can write this as-- let
me write the 5 out front-- 5

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.850
times-- this term
right over here

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.322
can be rewritten as
2c to the third power

00:01:11.322 --> 00:01:13.030
because it's 2 to the
third power times c

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.300
to the third power-- 8c to
the third power-- And then,

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.580
minus d to the third power.

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.980
And so this gives us, right over
here, a difference of cubes.

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:31.210
And you can actually factor
a difference of cubes.

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.120
And you may or may
not know the pattern.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.840
So if I have a to the
third minus b to the third,

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.390
this can be factored
as a minus b

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:45.980
times a squared plus
ab plus b squared.

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.530
And if you don't believe me, I
encourage you to multiply this

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.302
out, and you will get a to the
third minus b to the third.

00:01:51.302 --> 00:01:53.010
You get a bunch of
terms that cancel out,

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:54.940
so you're only left
with two terms.

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.870
And even though it's
not applicable here,

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:01.120
it's also good to know
that the sum of cubes

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.620
is also factorable.

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:10.130
It's factorable as a plus b
times a squared minus ab plus b

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:11.020
squared.

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.970
So once again, I won't go
through the time of multiplying

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.594
this out, but I
encourage you to do so.

00:02:14.594 --> 00:02:17.610
It just takes a little bit
of polynomial multiplication.

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.750
And you'll be able
to prove to yourself

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.490
that this is indeed the case.

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:24.550
Now, assuming that
this is the case,

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.150
we can just do a little
bit of pattern matching.

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:35.815
Because in this case, our
a is 2c, and our b is d.

00:02:35.815 --> 00:02:44.530
So let me write this. a is equal
to 2c, and our b is equal to d.

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.010
We have minus b to the third
and minus d to the third,

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.400
so b and d must
be the same thing.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.690
So this part inside
must factor out

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.650
to-- let me write my
5, open parentheses.

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.140
Let me give myself some space.

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.290
So it's going to factor
out into a minus b.

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:08.480
So a is 2c minus b, which is d.

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.500
So it factors out as the
difference of the two things

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.190
that I'm taking the cube of.

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:23.360
2c minus d times-- and now, I
have a squared is 2c squared.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:28.250
2c squared is the same
thing as 4c squared.

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.000
Let me make that. a squared is
equal to 2c-- the whole thing

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.490
squared, which is
equal to 4c squared.

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:39.860
So it's 4c squared
plus a times b.

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:47.570
So that's going to be 2c
times d, so plus 2c times d.

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:51.670
And then finally plus b squared,
and in our case, b is d.

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.564
So you get plus d squared.

00:03:54.564 --> 00:03:55.230
And you're done.

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:56.380
We have factored it out.

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.860
And actually, you could get
rid of one set of parentheses.

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:04.990
This can be factored as 5
times 2c minus d times 4c

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:09.380
squared plus 2cd plus d squared.

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.040
And we are done.
