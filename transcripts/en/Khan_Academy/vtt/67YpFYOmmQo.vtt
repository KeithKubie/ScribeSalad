00:00:00.408 --> 00:00:01.774
- [Voiceover] What I
hope to do in this video

00:00:01.774 --> 00:00:04.309
is leverage some of our
experience and knowledge

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:06.073
from the quadratic world

00:00:06.073 --> 00:00:09.974
to factor, and rewrite,
and re-express expressions

00:00:09.974 --> 00:00:11.542
that are higher degree,

00:00:11.542 --> 00:00:13.643
higher degree polynomials.

00:00:13.643 --> 00:00:15.234
So what am I talking about?

00:00:15.234 --> 00:00:17.672
So let's say that I have the expression

00:00:17.672 --> 00:00:19.495
a to the sixth power,

00:00:19.495 --> 00:00:23.477
plus 2a to the third power b squared,

00:00:23.477 --> 00:00:25.427
plus b to the fourth,

00:00:25.427 --> 00:00:26.937
and I want to factor this.

00:00:26.937 --> 00:00:29.444
I want to write this as a
product of two expressions.

00:00:29.444 --> 00:00:31.267
How do I do that?

00:00:31.267 --> 00:00:33.543
And at first, it might
seem a little intimidating.

00:00:33.543 --> 00:00:35.400
I have a to the sixth power!

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.770
This is a sixth degree term,

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:37.943
you have b to the fourth power,

00:00:37.943 --> 00:00:39.533
how do I handle it?

00:00:39.533 --> 00:00:41.844
But a clue, you might say,
"Well, this is kind of

00:00:41.844 --> 00:00:44.328
"looking like when I took a square of

00:00:44.328 --> 00:00:47.800
"a expression with two variables."

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.969
So let's just take a little
bit of a detour here.

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.069
If I took x plus y, squared,

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:55.369
what is this going to be equal to?

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:59.967
Well, this is x plus y, times x plus y,

00:00:59.967 --> 00:01:01.975
which is, of course, going to be equal to,

00:01:01.975 --> 00:01:04.506
x times x is x squared,

00:01:04.506 --> 00:01:06.271
then you have x times y is xy,

00:01:06.271 --> 00:01:07.989
but then you have y times x as well,

00:01:07.989 --> 00:01:10.439
so you have 2xy's, and this is all review.

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.190
If this isn't review, I
encourage you to watch

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:17.068
the videos on multiplying expressions,

00:01:17.068 --> 00:01:19.170
and then, or multiplying
binomials, I guess you could say,

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.807
and then you finally have y times y,

00:01:20.807 --> 00:01:22.966
so you'd have plus y squared.

00:01:22.966 --> 00:01:23.802
So when you write it like this,

00:01:23.802 --> 00:01:27.738
you see well it looks like
there might be a parallel.

00:01:27.738 --> 00:01:29.305
This a to the sixth term looks like it

00:01:29.305 --> 00:01:32.034
might parallel to this x squared term,

00:01:32.034 --> 00:01:34.100
and this b to the fourth
looks like it might

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.644
parallel to this, 'cause notice,

00:01:35.644 --> 00:01:37.990
if I have something squared here,

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.300
and then I have that
something in this middle term,

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.705
and I have something squared here,

00:01:41.705 --> 00:01:42.889
and I have that something
in that middle term,

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:43.969
and then I have a two,

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:46.140
well then, that means that
this thing is a perfect square.

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.974
It's x plus y, squared,

00:01:47.974 --> 00:01:49.600
and we do have that.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.808
Notice, a to the sixth,

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:53.244
that's the same thing as

00:01:53.244 --> 00:01:57.376
a to the third, squared,

00:01:57.376 --> 00:01:59.523
and then we have an a to the third

00:01:59.523 --> 00:02:02.138
right here, sitting in this middle term.

00:02:02.138 --> 00:02:02.730
So let me write that.

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:04.240
We have that a to the third there,

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.756
and of course we have this plus two there,

00:02:08.756 --> 00:02:11.022
and then b to the fourth,

00:02:11.438 --> 00:02:15.908
well, that's the same thing
as b squared, squared,

00:02:15.908 --> 00:02:18.566
and of course, we also have a b squared

00:02:18.566 --> 00:02:20.169
in this middle term.

00:02:20.169 --> 00:02:21.736
So when you write it this way,

00:02:21.736 --> 00:02:25.335
it has the exact same pattern
as we had right over here.

00:02:25.335 --> 00:02:28.346
This thing is nothing but,

00:02:29.654 --> 00:02:32.138
let me write it this way,

00:02:32.138 --> 00:02:36.944
as a to the third, let
me do it in those colors,

00:02:36.944 --> 00:02:41.653
as a to the third, plus b squared,

00:02:44.038 --> 00:02:48.473
and then that whole quantity squared,

00:02:48.473 --> 00:02:50.470
and you can see, look, if
we were to multiply it out,

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:51.166
and actually, let me just do it,

00:02:51.166 --> 00:02:53.109
I'll do it all in white,
so it makes sense to you,

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:55.300
or, so actually, it might
make a little less sense,

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.938
'cause I'm not gonna take--

00:02:55.938 --> 00:02:57.471
Actually, let me switch colors,

00:02:57.471 --> 00:03:00.693
so it's gonna be a to the third,

00:03:05.676 --> 00:03:07.664
plus b squared,

00:03:08.957 --> 00:03:12.524
times a to the third, plus b squared.

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.502
Well, a to the third times a to the third

00:03:23.502 --> 00:03:26.335
is a to the sixth.

00:03:26.335 --> 00:03:28.669
a to the third plus b
squared, that's gonna be

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:31.664
a to the third, b squared,

00:03:33.034 --> 00:03:34.776
and then you're gonna have b
squared times a to the third,

00:03:34.776 --> 00:03:36.633
well that's just another
a to the third, b squared,

00:03:36.633 --> 00:03:38.642
so actually, let's just write this as

00:03:38.642 --> 00:03:43.130
2a to the third,

00:03:44.807 --> 00:03:46.363
b squared,

00:03:47.303 --> 00:03:48.975
and then finally, b
squared times b squared

00:03:48.975 --> 00:03:52.167
is going to be b to the fourth power.

00:03:52.167 --> 00:03:54.501
So once again, if you
see something like this,

00:03:54.501 --> 00:03:56.103
you're like, okay, it seems daunting,

00:03:56.103 --> 00:03:59.022
but it seems close to a
pattern that I've seen

00:03:59.022 --> 00:04:01.142
when I've been dealing with quadratics.

00:04:01.142 --> 00:04:03.743
This looks close to a
perfect square quadratic,

00:04:03.743 --> 00:04:04.811
and if you actually write this out,

00:04:04.811 --> 00:04:05.809
it's actually a pretty big hit,

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:08.340
you see, well look, if
x is a to the third,

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.788
and y is b squared, then these
are the exact same thing.

00:04:11.788 --> 00:04:14.540
So this is a factored out version of it.

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.339
Let's do another one of these.

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:21.274
So let's say, let me draw
a little dotted line here,

00:04:21.274 --> 00:04:23.271
and let's say that we have

00:04:23.271 --> 00:04:25.767
an eighth degree polynomial.

00:04:25.767 --> 00:04:28.135
We have x to the eighth,

00:04:28.135 --> 00:04:32.942
minus 12x to the fourth, minus two,

00:04:32.942 --> 00:04:35.333
and we want to complete the square here,

00:04:35.333 --> 00:04:36.889
and you're probably used
to completing the square

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:40.894
with second degree
polynomials, or quadratics,

00:04:40.894 --> 00:04:42.636
and all of a sudden you
have an eighth degree,

00:04:42.636 --> 00:04:44.935
but there's no reason why
you can't do that here,

00:04:44.935 --> 00:04:47.338
'cause we could say this is
going to be the same thing as

00:04:47.338 --> 00:04:52.168
x to the eighth, minus
12x to the fourth power.

00:04:52.168 --> 00:04:56.208
Whoops, my primitive brain
wrote x squared there.

00:04:56.208 --> 00:04:59.169
x to the eighth, minus 12x to the fourth,

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:01.374
and let me create some space
to add and subtract something,

00:05:01.374 --> 00:05:04.242
and then let me put
the minus two out here,

00:05:04.242 --> 00:05:05.635
and we just have to realize that, look,

00:05:05.635 --> 00:05:06.703
for it to be a perfect square,

00:05:06.703 --> 00:05:10.500
that this is x to the fourth,
squared right over here.

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.834
We have an x to the fourth here,

00:05:12.834 --> 00:05:14.505
and so, just like we
would complete the square

00:05:14.505 --> 00:05:17.605
if we were doing it with a
second degree polynomial,

00:05:17.605 --> 00:05:21.135
or quadratic, you would take
half the coefficient here,

00:05:21.135 --> 00:05:24.978
which is six, and then we
would want to add that,

00:05:24.978 --> 00:05:26.603
so we would want to add,

00:05:26.603 --> 00:05:28.089
well, we wouldn't add
half that coefficient,

00:05:28.089 --> 00:05:29.877
we would add the square
of half that coefficient.

00:05:29.877 --> 00:05:31.676
This is just how you complete the square,

00:05:31.676 --> 00:05:34.449
if this was an x squared,
and this was just an x,

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:36.373
and the key here is just realize

00:05:36.373 --> 00:05:38.968
that x to the eighth, is
x to the fourth, squared.

00:05:38.968 --> 00:05:39.769
When you did it with quadratics,

00:05:39.769 --> 00:05:42.207
you just had an x here, and
you just had the x squared.

00:05:42.207 --> 00:05:43.507
Now you have an x to the fourth here,

00:05:43.507 --> 00:05:44.959
and you have x to the fourth squared,

00:05:44.959 --> 00:05:46.410
which is x to the eighth.

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:48.267
But you take half of this coefficient,

00:05:48.267 --> 00:05:51.030
which is six.

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:51.971
You could do it as negative six,

00:05:51.971 --> 00:05:52.934
since you have this out here,

00:05:52.934 --> 00:05:56.011
but then you square it, and you get 36.

00:05:56.011 --> 00:05:59.076
But you can't just add 36
willy, nilly to an expression.

00:05:59.076 --> 00:06:00.365
That changes its value.

00:06:00.365 --> 00:06:01.305
In order to not change its value,

00:06:01.305 --> 00:06:04.103
you also need to subtract 36.

00:06:04.103 --> 00:06:05.810
But the whole point of doing it is,

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:09.037
this part of it now is a perfect square.

00:06:09.037 --> 00:06:12.636
It's a perfect square
eighth degree polynomial.

00:06:12.636 --> 00:06:14.144
So this is going to be the same thing as

00:06:14.144 --> 00:06:16.129
x to the fourth,

00:06:16.914 --> 00:06:19.774
minus, let me write it this way,

00:06:19.774 --> 00:06:21.132
x to the fourth,

00:06:21.132 --> 00:06:26.008
minus six, squared.

00:06:26.008 --> 00:06:28.400
Maybe I should have written this in blue.

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:29.944
The colors are the hard part.

00:06:29.944 --> 00:06:33.032
x to the fourth, minus six,

00:06:33.032 --> 00:06:35.470
and then the whole thing squared,

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:36.805
and then, of course, I have to worry about

00:06:36.805 --> 00:06:38.845
these two characters out here.

00:06:39.276 --> 00:06:41.207
If I subtract 36 and then subtract two,

00:06:41.207 --> 00:06:44.109
well, that's the same
thing as subtracting 38.

00:06:44.109 --> 00:06:45.340
So just like that, this is just like

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:47.964
completing the square with
a second degree polynomial,

00:06:47.964 --> 00:06:51.203
but I just did it with an
eighth degree polynomial.

00:06:51.203 --> 00:06:52.236
Let's do one more,

00:06:52.236 --> 00:06:54.930
just to really exercise this muscle.

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:56.834
This, in some ways, isn't a new skill.

00:06:56.834 --> 00:06:58.703
This is just looking at an old skill,

00:06:58.703 --> 00:07:01.373
and applying it to slightly hairier,

00:07:01.373 --> 00:07:02.801
slightly more complex things,

00:07:02.801 --> 00:07:05.971
or maybe realizing that they
aren't that more complex.

00:07:05.971 --> 00:07:09.137
So let's say that we had

00:07:11.137 --> 00:07:14.535
25x to the sixth,

00:07:14.535 --> 00:07:18.822
minus 16y squared.

00:07:21.561 --> 00:07:23.070
So let's do this at the top.

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:24.777
What are other ways we can write this?

00:07:24.777 --> 00:07:25.814
Can we factor things?

00:07:25.814 --> 00:07:27.633
What are other ways could we write it?

00:07:27.633 --> 00:07:29.841
Well, one way that we could write it,

00:07:29.841 --> 00:07:31.848
we could say that, look,

00:07:33.848 --> 00:07:35.034
25 is five squared,

00:07:35.034 --> 00:07:37.438
and x to the sixth is x
to the third, squared,

00:07:37.438 --> 00:07:41.977
so we could rewrite
this right over here as

00:07:41.977 --> 00:07:44.444
five squared, times

00:07:44.444 --> 00:07:47.681
x to the third, squared,

00:07:47.681 --> 00:07:50.534
and then we have minus,

00:07:50.534 --> 00:07:52.298
16 is four squared.

00:07:52.298 --> 00:07:53.796
Let me do this in this color.

00:07:53.796 --> 00:07:57.198
16 is four squared, y squared,

00:07:57.198 --> 00:07:59.276
so we could write it like this if we like.

00:07:59.276 --> 00:08:00.309
But we could also write it,

00:08:00.309 --> 00:08:02.237
we have five to the second power,

00:08:02.237 --> 00:08:04.071
we have x to the third,
to the second power.

00:08:04.071 --> 00:08:05.267
Well we could use our exponent properties,

00:08:05.267 --> 00:08:07.458
say, well this is going
to be the same thing as

00:08:07.458 --> 00:08:11.606
5x to the third, to the second power.

00:08:11.606 --> 00:08:12.639
If I have a product of two things,

00:08:12.639 --> 00:08:13.835
and I raise it to the power,

00:08:13.835 --> 00:08:15.089
that's the same thing as

00:08:15.089 --> 00:08:16.470
taking the product of each of them,

00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:17.840
raised to the power,

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:19.942
or, if I take the product and
then raise it to the power,

00:08:19.942 --> 00:08:20.627
that's the same thing as

00:08:20.627 --> 00:08:22.055
raising them each to the power first,

00:08:22.055 --> 00:08:23.367
and then taking the product.

00:08:23.367 --> 00:08:25.004
It's one of our exponent properties.

00:08:25.004 --> 00:08:27.091
Now we could do the same thing

00:08:27.445 --> 00:08:29.455
for the second term.

00:08:29.455 --> 00:08:32.009
Four squared times y
squared is the same thing as

00:08:32.009 --> 00:08:34.436
4y, squared,

00:08:34.436 --> 00:08:35.562
and when you write it like this,

00:08:35.562 --> 00:08:36.665
and this is another legitimate way

00:08:36.665 --> 00:08:39.800
to rewrite this higher degree expression,

00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:43.039
you now see that this is
a difference of squares,

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:44.200
and if it's a difference of squares,

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:46.296
we can rewrite it as,

00:08:46.681 --> 00:08:48.708
let me do it like this.

00:08:48.708 --> 00:08:50.391
We can rewrite it as

00:08:50.391 --> 00:08:52.553
5x to the third

00:08:53.677 --> 00:08:55.550
plus 4y,

00:08:58.058 --> 00:09:01.468
times 5x to the third

00:09:01.468 --> 00:09:03.390
minus 4y.

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:07.149
Once again, this comes straight out of

00:09:07.149 --> 00:09:09.034
when you first learned

00:09:09.373 --> 00:09:11.775
a squared, minus b squared is equal to

00:09:11.775 --> 00:09:15.374
a plus b, times a minus b.

00:09:15.374 --> 00:09:18.334
In this case, a is 5x to the third power,

00:09:18.334 --> 00:09:20.761
and b is 4y,

00:09:20.761 --> 00:09:22.932
and you see that right over here.

00:09:22.932 --> 00:09:24.801
So once again, whole point here is

00:09:24.801 --> 00:09:27.402
just apply some of our quadratic toolkit,

00:09:27.402 --> 00:09:29.375
but applying it to higher
degree polynomials,

00:09:29.375 --> 00:09:32.851
and seeing that it's really,
on some levels, the same thing.
