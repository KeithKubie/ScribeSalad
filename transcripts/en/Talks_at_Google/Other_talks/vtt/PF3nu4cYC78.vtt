00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:14.049
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: So, Bart Ehrman is the
author of more than 20 books, including the

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:27.180
New York Times Bestselling "Misquoting Jesus,"
"God's Problem," and "Jesus Interrupted."

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.820
He is the James A. Gray Distinguished Professor
of Religious Studies at the University of

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:36.550
North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and is a leading
authority on the Bible and the life of Jesus.

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:43.469
He has been featured in Time and has appeared
on NBC Dateline, The Daily Show with John

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.910
Stewart, The Colbert Report, CNN, History
Channel, and other top media outlets.

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.800
And I found it very amusing that The Daily
Show and The Colbert Report was then followed

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:53.800
by other top media outlets.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:54.800
And he lives in Durham, North Carolina.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:55.800
So, please join me in welcoming Bart Ehrman.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:56.800
[applause]

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:57.800
&gt;&gt;Bart Ehrman: Thanks.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:58.800
Thanks for coming out.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.109
So, this talk is based on the book that I
just did that I'm doing a little book tour

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.109
on.

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:07.580
The book is called "Forged: Writing in the
Name of God--Why the Bible's Authors Are Not

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.130
Who We Think They Are."

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.950
And so, the talk will be involving that.

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:12.950
Right.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.160
It might help if I turned on the mic.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.160
OK.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.160
Yes.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.160
That's working better.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.160
Good.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.160
Thanks.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.160
So, I'm on this book tour in the midst of
teaching full-time.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.680
I'm teaching at the University of North Carolina.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:31.340
And at the University of North Carolina, most
of my students come from very conservative,

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.350
evangelical churches because it's the Bible
Belt.

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:43.670
And so, when I start teaching my class, as
I did this semester, I have a pretty large

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:49.900
class, 180 students in it, and I begin my
class, after handing out the syllabus, in

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.450
explaining that this class is not like a church.

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:54.980
This is not a Sunday school.

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.490
I'm not a preacher or evangelist.

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:57.630
I'm a historian.

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.340
And this class will be taught from a historical
perspective.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:08.341
So, the New Testament, not as a book of faith,
which it is of course, but the New Testament

00:02:08.341 --> 00:02:11.680
as a document situated in history.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.260
"And so, this will be a different approach,"

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.519
I tell them from what they're used to, if
they've been to church, which most of them

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:18.340
have.

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:25.069
So, once I turn out the syllabus on the very
first day of class, the first thing I do is

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:30.019
I give them a pop quiz, which they think is
a little bit odd because I haven't taught

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:31.019
them anything yet.

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:32.680
But I give them a pop quiz.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:38.310
And part of the reason for the pop quiz is
I want to know how much they know about the

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.959
New Testament before I start teaching.

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:44.400
And I also want them to know how much they
know about the New Testament.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.030
And so, that's the point of the quiz.

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.230
So, this quiz has eleven questions on it.

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:55.700
And I begin by telling them that if anyone
in the room can get eight out of the eleven

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.269
right, I'll buy them dinner at the Armadillo
Grill.

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:07.310
So, this year, out of 180 students, I bought
one dinner because my students are more committed

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.170
to the Bible than knowledgeable about the
Bible.

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.959
And so, and it's actually not that hard of
a quiz.

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:20.659
So, the first question on the quiz is, "How
many books are in the New Testament?"

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:25.319
It's basic information if you think of somebody
to study the New Testament for 19 years or

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:26.319
so.

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:27.389
But no, in fact, my students don't know.

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:29.420
The answer it turns out is pretty easy.

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:30.890
The answer is 27.

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.459
And the reason that's easy is because when
you think about the New Testament, you think

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:36.459
about God.

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:38.909
You think about the Christian God.

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:40.529
You think Trinity.

00:03:40.529 --> 00:03:41.529
And what is 27?

00:03:41.529 --> 00:03:43.109
Three to the third power.

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:47.029
So, it's a miracle.

00:03:47.029 --> 00:03:48.029
[laughter]

00:03:48.029 --> 00:03:53.909
So then the next question is, "In what language
were these books written?"

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:56.669
Now, this one really stumped a lot of my students.

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:59.959
About half of my students think that the answer
is Hebrew.

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:02.239
And I've never quite figured that out.

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:08.099
But I think it's because when you watch all
these Jesus documentaries on History Channel,

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:11.900
Discovery Channel, they're always flashing
up Hebrew texts back behind.

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.349
And so, people naturally think Hebrew, Jesus,
and--.

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:17.510
But that's wrong.

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:22.450
Normally, only four or five of my students
think that the answer is English.

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.200
[laughter]

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.700
I'm kidding.

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:32.630
The right answer is Greek, as it turns out,
because Greek was the lingua franca of the

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:33.630
Roman Empire.

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:34.630
It's what everybody spoke.

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:38.820
Just like today, you go to Europe and you
need to get around Germany or France or Italy,

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.920
if you speak English pretty much you can get
around.

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.830
In the Roman Empire, if you spoke Greek you
could pretty well get around.

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.810
And so, people who wanted to communicate broadly
would write in Greek.

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:50.370
And so, these books are all written in Greek.

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:53.640
So, these are the kinds of questions I ask--basic,
factual information.

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:59.340
I do throw in a few curveballs because I don't
wanna buy any dinners.

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:05.390
And so, one of my curveballs is, I ask, "What
was the Apostle Paul's last name?"

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:07.330
Well, right.

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:13.211
Somebody will always say "of Tarsis," Paul
of Tarsis, but the point is people in the

00:05:13.211 --> 00:05:20.240
ancient world didn't have last names unless
they were upper crust, elite, Roman aristocracy.

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.300
Then, they had lots of names.

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:27.500
But if they were just a normal person, they
just had one name, which is why in the New

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:30.300
Testament, we have all these people with the
same name.

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:35.820
And when people have the same name, then they
give some kind of identifying feature to let

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:37.110
you know which one they're talking about.

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:40.210
So, you have all these Mary's in the New Testament.

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:46.770
So, they're always identified: Mary, the mother
of Jesus; Mary of Bethany; Mary Magdalene.

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:52.100
See, these are identifiers because they didn't
have other ways of identifying because they

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:53.100
didn't have last names.

00:05:53.100 --> 00:06:00.490
And I have to teach my students that because
they naturally assumed that Jesus Christ,

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:02.190
Christ is his last name.

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:06.990
So, I have to tell them, "It's not Jesus Christ
born to Joseph and Mary Christ."

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:08.160
It's an identifying--.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.320
Christ means "Messiah."

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.600
It's as saying Jesus is the Messiah.

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:17.510
So anyway, so my students don't know basic
information about the Bible, even though they

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:21.680
believe it, let alone scholarship about the
Bible.

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:26.140
And so, the class is really about scholarship
on the Bible, which they know absolutely nothing

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:29.240
about because they've never heard any of this
stuff in church.

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:32.160
Even though, in many cases, their pastors
will have known it because the pastors got

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.210
trained places that teach this kind of thing.

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:39.600
One of the things that my students don't know
about is, what I'm talking with you about

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:47.800
for the next 20 minutes or so, which is that
there are books in the New Testament that

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:50.730
claim to be written by people who did not
write them.

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:55.420
Now, in a modern world, if somebody writes
a book claiming to be someone famous when

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:59.090
they're not that person, we call that a forgery.

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:04.240
And what I argue in my book, "Forged," is
that ancient people also thought negatively

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:06.860
of this kind of literary activity.

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:10.240
They also thought it was a form of lying and
deceit.

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:12.800
And they didn't accept it.

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:16.610
And I try and show why it is that scholars,
nonetheless, think that there are books in

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:21.680
the New Testament that were not written by
the people who are named as their author's.

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:23.920
So, I wanna talk about that.

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:27.310
That's the main topic I wanna talk about,
but to get there, I wanna talk about, just

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:32.300
to set the stage, by talking about a couple
books that did not make it into the New Testament.

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:36.840
A couple books that didn't make it in, which
are absolutely forgeries.

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:44.380
So the first example I wanna talk about is
a gospel that allegedly is written by Jesus's

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:48.970
disciple, Simon Peter, the gospel of Peter.

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:51.480
This book was lost for centuries.

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:55.770
It was not discovered until 1886.

00:07:55.770 --> 00:08:02.000
There was a French archeological team that
was working out of Cairo, Egypt, that was

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.330
digging in a different part of Egypt.

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:06.360
It's a place called Akhmim.

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:09.900
It's about halfway down the Nile in Egypt.

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:15.210
And in Akhmim, they were digging up a cemetery.

00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:19.360
And in this cemetery, these archeologists
uncovered a tomb of somebody they thought

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:20.930
was a monk.

00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:24.550
They thought he was monk because he was buried
with a sacred book, and it's this book that

00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:25.680
I'm interested in.

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:32.370
This book is a 66-page book that contains
four documents.

00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:37.219
So, it's a kind of anthology, ancient anthology
of text.

00:08:37.219 --> 00:08:38.500
Four texts in it.

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:41.699
The first one is this one that I'm calling
the Gospel of Peter.

00:08:41.699 --> 00:08:46.730
The first ten pages give this gospel of Peter,
but they don't give the entire thing.

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:50.350
We don't have the whole Gospel of Peter.

00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:53.449
The book actually begins in the middle of
a sentence.

00:08:53.449 --> 00:08:56.540
So, this is a fragment of the Gospel of Peter.

00:08:56.540 --> 00:09:02.490
And what I mean by that is I don't mean that
this book that we have is itself a fragment.

00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:03.730
It's an entire book.

00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:04.949
The first page is blank.

00:09:04.949 --> 00:09:07.300
The second page has a cross drawn on it.

00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:11.231
The third page, at the top of the page in
the upper left-hand side it begins, but it

00:09:11.231 --> 00:09:13.370
begins in the middle of a sentence.

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:18.720
So, the scribe who was copying this book,
probably in the 6th Century--.

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:22.430
The 6th Century scribe who was copying this
book was copying what was a fragment.

00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:23.430
OK?

00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:24.510
So, the book isn't a fragment.

00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:26.160
He was copying a fragment.

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:33.040
The book begins with these words, "and none
of the Jews wanted to wash their hands, so

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:35.899
Pilate stood up."

00:09:35.899 --> 00:09:40.279
Now, that calls to mind a passage found in
the New Testament.

00:09:40.279 --> 00:09:48.529
In the Gospel of Matthew, where Jesus is put
on trial before Pontius Pilate and Pilate

00:09:48.529 --> 00:09:50.080
declares Jesus innocent.

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:55.380
And to show that he thinks he's innocent,
he washes his hands in front of the crowd

00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:57.990
and says, "I'm innocent of this man's blood."

00:09:57.990 --> 00:10:03.120
And the crowd, the Jewish crowd, cries out,
"His blood be upon us and our children."

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:08.390
So, the Jewish crowd is taking responsibility
for the death of Jesus.

00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:13.009
This is the verse that we used for all of
the papal, anti-Semitic purposes over the

00:10:13.009 --> 00:10:15.329
centuries.

00:10:15.329 --> 00:10:19.639
The Gospel of Peter doesn't have that verse,
but it does have a verse not found in Matthew,

00:10:19.639 --> 00:10:22.870
which is "none of the Jews wanted to wash
their hands."

00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:29.699
Well, what happens in this account of Jesus's
death is that the Jews are far more guilty

00:10:29.699 --> 00:10:33.410
for Jesus's death, even than they are in Matthew,
Mark, and Luke.

00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:36.769
The Jews are more culpable in the death of
Jesus.

00:10:36.769 --> 00:10:41.399
And so that's one of the themes in this Gospel
of Peter.

00:10:41.399 --> 00:10:45.649
It's a very anti-Jewish form of the gospel.

00:10:45.649 --> 00:10:53.810
It is an account of Jesus going on trial,
being condemned, being crucified, and then

00:10:53.810 --> 00:10:54.870
being raised from the dead.

00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:59.329
Which, of course, is an account that you get
in Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John in the New

00:10:59.329 --> 00:11:00.329
Testament as well.

00:11:00.329 --> 00:11:04.949
But in this account, there are many differences
from the others.

00:11:04.949 --> 00:11:07.870
The most stark difference comes at the very
end.

00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:12.829
The Gospel of Peter, unlike the other gospels
that we have, do not--.

00:11:12.829 --> 00:11:19.829
The Gospel of Peter narrates an account of
Jesus being raised from the dead.

00:11:19.829 --> 00:11:25.370
And in a way, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John
narrate Jesus being raised from the dead,

00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:26.370
right?

00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:27.370
No, they don't.

00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:30.480
In Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, Jesus is
crucified.

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:31.480
He's dead.

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:33.220
And then he's buried.

00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:39.500
On the third day, the women go to the tomb
and they find the tomb empty.

00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:43.089
In other words, Jesus has been raised from
the dead, but you're not given a story of

00:11:43.089 --> 00:11:44.089
it happening.

00:11:44.089 --> 00:11:46.430
There's no story of Jesus coming out of the
tomb.

00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:50.600
But there is a story like that in the Gospel
of Peter.

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:52.440
And it's a terrific story.

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:58.569
What happens is, according to this Gospel
of Peter, the authorities sent a guard at

00:11:58.569 --> 00:12:02.240
the tomb of Jesus to make sure nobody comes
to steal the body.

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:09.000
And as the guard is guarding the tomb, they
look up and they see the heavens rip open.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.089
And two angelic beings descend from Heaven.

00:12:12.089 --> 00:12:17.939
And as they descend from Heaven, the stone
in front of the tomb rolls away by itself.

00:12:17.939 --> 00:12:18.939
They come down.

00:12:18.939 --> 00:12:20.930
They enter into the tomb.

00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:24.829
And then, as the guard is watching, three
people come out of the tomb.

00:12:24.829 --> 00:12:29.779
Two of them are so tall that their head reaches
up to the sky.

00:12:29.779 --> 00:12:33.010
The third is so tall that they're supporting
him.

00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:35.980
His head reaches up above the sky.

00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:42.009
And after they come out of the tomb, behind
them from the tomb emerges the cross.

00:12:42.009 --> 00:12:49.180
And a voice comes from Heaven and says, "Have
you preached to those who are asleep?"

00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:51.379
And the cross replies, "Yes."

00:12:51.379 --> 00:12:56.410
So, here we have a giant Jesus and a walking,
talking cross.

00:12:56.410 --> 00:12:57.410
[laughter]

00:12:57.410 --> 00:13:00.079
How this thing got lost for centuries, I don't
know.

00:13:00.079 --> 00:13:03.600
You'd think this would be one you'd wanna
keep, but it eventually got lost.

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:07.509
Well so, the whole thing is metaphorical,
of course.

00:13:07.509 --> 00:13:13.910
I mean, the reason these two angels are as
tall as skyscrapers is because they're angels.

00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:14.910
They're superhuman.

00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:17.199
And so, superhumans are really big.

00:13:17.199 --> 00:13:20.470
And Jesus is taller than them because he's
even more superhuman.

00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:22.019
He's the son of God.

00:13:22.019 --> 00:13:23.259
So he's really tall.

00:13:23.259 --> 00:13:28.170
And the cross walking out, that's a metaphor
for--.

00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:33.449
The question is, did the message of the cross
of Jesus go to those who were already dead?

00:13:33.449 --> 00:13:35.519
Have you preached to those who are asleep?

00:13:35.519 --> 00:13:37.070
The answer being yes.

00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:42.569
The message of Jesus's salvation on the cross
has gone even to those who died before Jesus

00:13:42.569 --> 00:13:43.660
came on Earth.

00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:46.540
And so, that's a theological statement read
through a metaphor.

00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:47.540
All right.

00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:51.620
Well, one of the other interesting features
of this Gospel of Peter is what happens at

00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:53.339
the very end.

00:13:53.339 --> 00:13:56.649
Because at the end, the author identifies
himself.

00:13:56.649 --> 00:14:02.730
The last verse of the Gospel of Peter says
this: I Simon Peter and my brother, Andrew,

00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:04.779
decided to go fishing.

00:14:04.779 --> 00:14:09.059
And with us went Levi, the son of Alpheus
whom the Lord--.

00:14:09.059 --> 00:14:10.309
And that's where it stops.

00:14:10.309 --> 00:14:13.579
So, it stops right in the middle of the sentence.

00:14:13.579 --> 00:14:16.970
And so, you're not sure exactly what's gonna
happen next, but it looks like what's gonna

00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:18.459
happen next is they're gonna go fishing.

00:14:18.459 --> 00:14:22.389
They're gonna see Jesus raise from the dead
and have a conversation with him, we get.

00:14:22.389 --> 00:14:23.759
But it stops there.

00:14:23.759 --> 00:14:28.089
But for my purposes, the interesting thing
is, the author identifies himself.

00:14:28.089 --> 00:14:30.950
I, Simon Peter.

00:14:30.950 --> 00:14:34.970
That's striking because Matthew, Mark, Luke,
and John in the New Testament are written

00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:38.829
by authors who do not identify themselves.

00:14:38.829 --> 00:14:41.149
The Gospels in the New Testament are anonymous.

00:14:41.149 --> 00:14:45.110
Only later, people said, "Oh yeah, this one's
written by Matthew.

00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:46.110
This one's written by Mark.

00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:47.110
This one by Luke."

00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:51.149
And then later, scribes put in titles of the
Gospel "according to Matthew."

00:14:51.149 --> 00:14:54.879
But there's nothing in Matthew to think that
Matthew wrote it.

00:14:54.879 --> 00:14:56.699
There's no first person narrative.

00:14:56.699 --> 00:15:00.709
The author never says, "You know, one day
Jesus came up to me and we went to Jerusalem

00:15:00.709 --> 00:15:02.439
and we did this, that, or the other."

00:15:02.439 --> 00:15:04.579
It's all the third person narrative.

00:15:04.579 --> 00:15:07.040
Not the Gospel of Peter, though.

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:10.809
The Gospel of Peter is written by somebody
claiming to be Peter.

00:15:10.809 --> 00:15:16.990
But this gospel was certainly written sometime
in this early Second Century, at least 60

00:15:16.990 --> 00:15:19.459
years after Peter was dead.

00:15:19.459 --> 00:15:25.380
This is somebody claiming to be Peter, knowing
full well he wasn't Peter.

00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:28.670
In other words, this is somebody lying about
his identity.

00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:33.589
In the ancient world, they would call that
kind of writing a lie, a pseudos.

00:15:33.589 --> 00:15:37.790
In modern terms, we would call it a forgery,
somebody claiming to be someone other than

00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:39.629
he was.

00:15:39.629 --> 00:15:45.069
New Testament scholars have long claimed that
this kind of literary activity of claiming

00:15:45.069 --> 00:15:51.220
to be someone other than who you were was
both widespread and acceptable in the ancient

00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:52.220
world.

00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:58.360
One of the things I try to show in my book
is that in fact, it was widespread, but it

00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:00.319
was not acceptable.

00:16:00.319 --> 00:16:03.499
Ancient people said very nasty things about
this kind of literary activity.

00:16:03.499 --> 00:16:04.689
They didn't approve of it.

00:16:04.689 --> 00:16:09.570
They thought it was deceitful and they weren't
in support of it.

00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:10.570
So,

00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:11.570
OK.

00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:12.570
So, that's the Gospel of Peter.

00:16:12.570 --> 00:16:16.189
I'll give you a second example from outside
the New Testament of a book allegedly written

00:16:16.189 --> 00:16:17.189
by Peter.

00:16:17.189 --> 00:16:20.269
This time it's called "The Apocalypse of Peter."

00:16:20.269 --> 00:16:21.569
[pause]

00:16:21.569 --> 00:16:27.910
"The Apocalypse of Peter" as it turns out
is also in the 66-page book that these archeologists

00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:29.089
discovered in Egypt.

00:16:29.089 --> 00:16:35.670
In some ways, "The Apocalypse of Peter" is
more interesting even than the Gospel of Peter.

00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:43.910
"The Apocalypse of Peter" is the first instance
we have of somebody being given a guided tour

00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:46.129
of Heaven and Hell.

00:16:46.129 --> 00:16:50.850
So, you probably know about this idea of the
guided tour into Heaven and Hell from Dante's

00:16:50.850 --> 00:16:51.850
"Divine Comedy."

00:16:51.850 --> 00:16:56.310
Well, Dante didn't make up the idea of the
guided tour of Heaven and Hell.

00:16:56.310 --> 00:16:59.350
It's an old motif that goes way back in Christianity.

00:16:59.350 --> 00:17:04.390
And the earliest instance we have of it is
here in this "Apocalypse of Peter."

00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:15.169
In "The Apocalypse of Peter," it's Peter himself
who is given a first-hand account of this

00:17:15.169 --> 00:17:17.819
guided tour of Heaven and Hell.

00:17:17.819 --> 00:17:22.949
Peter is given a tour by Jesus himself to
show him the realms of the blessed and the

00:17:22.949 --> 00:17:24.680
realms of the damned.

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:31.260
Now, the interesting thing about the Gospel
of Peter is that like a lot of other guided

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:38.409
tours of Heaven and Hell, the description
of the realms of the blessed, of Heaven, are

00:17:38.409 --> 00:17:42.059
really not all that interesting.

00:17:42.059 --> 00:17:47.080
And the reason is because there's only so
many ways you can describe eternal bliss.

00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:48.080
[chuckle]

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:49.919
I mean, people in Heaven are happy.

00:17:49.919 --> 00:17:52.549
You know, blessed are the saints in the Heavenly
reign of--.

00:17:52.549 --> 00:17:54.590
Yea, blessed are they, oh happy.

00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:55.590
Blessed are the saints.

00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:56.590
Yea.

00:17:56.590 --> 00:17:57.590
Joyful.

00:17:57.590 --> 00:17:58.590
Blessed.

00:17:58.590 --> 00:17:59.590
Happy are they."

00:17:59.590 --> 00:18:00.590
I mean, they're happy.

00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:01.590
It's great.

00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:02.590
They're in Heaven.

00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:03.590
How good can it get?

00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:04.590
This is as good as it gets.

00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:05.590
This is great.

00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:07.070
So, the description is not all that interesting.

00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:11.809
But if you have any creative imagination at
all and wanted to describe the torments of

00:18:11.809 --> 00:18:16.280
the damned, you can come up with some really
interesting accounts.

00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:17.740
And that's what happens here.

00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:22.230
So, the descriptions of the realms of the
damned are much more interesting.

00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:28.549
And what happens in the realms of the damned
is that many people are punished according

00:18:28.549 --> 00:18:31.480
to their characteristic sin.

00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:36.010
So whatever was their characteristic sin while
alive, that's how they're punished after death.

00:18:36.010 --> 00:18:42.410
And so, Peter sees a place where the blasphemers
are being punished.

00:18:42.410 --> 00:18:48.649
And they're being punished by being hanged
by their tongues over eternal flames because

00:18:48.649 --> 00:18:49.929
they lied against God.

00:18:49.929 --> 00:18:53.480
And so, they used their tongues against God,
so they're hanged by their tongues over eternal

00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:54.480
flame.

00:18:54.480 --> 00:19:00.690
He goes to another place and the women who
braided their hair to make themselves attractive

00:19:00.690 --> 00:19:05.980
to seduce men are hanged by their hair over
eternal flames.

00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:12.760
The men they seduced are hanged by a different
body part over eternal flames.

00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:13.760
[laughter]

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:16.890
And in this case, the men cry out, "We didn't
know it would come to this."

00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:18.179
As you can well imagine.

00:19:18.179 --> 00:19:19.179
[laughter]

00:19:19.179 --> 00:19:23.340
So, you get this description of the realms
the blessed, the realms of the damned, and

00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:27.530
it claims to be written by Peter himself.

00:19:27.530 --> 00:19:30.240
The point of the account is pretty obvious.

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:35.890
If you want to enjoy the blessings of Heaven
and avoid the torments of Hell, then don't

00:19:35.890 --> 00:19:36.890
sin.

00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:40.690
You know, that's just a simple lesson.

00:19:40.690 --> 00:19:46.080
But here again, we have an incidence of a
book that claims to be written by Simon Peter,

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:50.160
Jesus's right-hand man, his head disciple.

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:51.710
But it certainly was not written by Peter.

00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:57.899
It wasn't written until the 2nd Century, 60,
70, 80 years after Peter was dead.

00:19:57.899 --> 00:20:01.130
Somebody claiming to be Peter who wasn't.

00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:06.139
These are not the only two books that we have
from early Christianity that claimed to be

00:20:06.139 --> 00:20:07.309
written by Peter.

00:20:07.309 --> 00:20:10.980
We have letters allegedly written by Peter.

00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:16.120
We have three other Apocalypses claimed to
be written by Peter.

00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:22.870
Writing books in the name of Peter was something
of a cottage industry in early Christianity.

00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:29.809
Is it possible that books written in the name
of Peter made it into the New Testament?

00:20:29.809 --> 00:20:34.720
Well as it turns out, there are two books
that claim to be written in the New Testament

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:37.169
by Peter: First and Second Peter.

00:20:37.169 --> 00:20:40.529
I'm gonna argue in a minute that Peter didn't
write those either.

00:20:40.529 --> 00:20:46.250
And I'm gonna argue that there are other forgeries
in the New Testament, books that claim to

00:20:46.250 --> 00:20:48.769
be written by somebody who did not, in fact,
write them.

00:20:48.769 --> 00:20:55.210
First, let me say something about the prominence
of forgery in antiquity broadly.

00:20:55.210 --> 00:20:57.779
As it turns out, it was a wide phenomenon.

00:20:57.779 --> 00:21:00.809
It did happen a lot in the ancient world,
more than happens today.

00:21:00.809 --> 00:21:02.539
It still happens today.

00:21:02.539 --> 00:21:05.990
People still write forgeries today.

00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:10.940
But it's easier to detect forgeries today
because we have all sorts of technologies

00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:14.000
and handwriting analysis and stylistic analysis.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.830
We have better ways of being able to detect
forgery now than they had back then.

00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:21.029
And so, people practiced it a lot more then.

00:21:21.029 --> 00:21:22.570
But people did practice it back then.

00:21:22.570 --> 00:21:26.250
We know this because ancient people actually
talk about it.

00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:31.200
And in almost every case that they say something
about forgery, they condemn it because people

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:35.649
didn't like it back then any more than you
would like it today if somebody published

00:21:35.649 --> 00:21:39.929
a letter or a book in your name claiming to
be you when they weren't you.

00:21:39.929 --> 00:21:43.830
Well, they didn't like it in the ancient world
either.

00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:49.000
Let me give a couple of anecdotes to explain
how ancient people thought about forgery.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:53.650
The first involves a non-Christian, just to
show you that this phenomenon happened in

00:21:53.650 --> 00:21:54.650
the Roman world.

00:21:54.650 --> 00:21:55.720
It happened in the Greek world.

00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:57.000
It happened among the Jews.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.960
It happened among the Christians.

00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:01.600
Forgery was a widespread phenomenon.

00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:05.389
To give you the non-Christian example, a Roman
example.

00:22:05.389 --> 00:22:07.779
A guy named Galen.

00:22:07.779 --> 00:22:11.279
Galen was a very famous author in the 2nd
Christian century.

00:22:11.279 --> 00:22:15.640
He was a doctor, a medical man, who wrote
a lot of books.

00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:19.000
In one of his books,

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:24.080
Galen gives an autobiographical account in
which he indicates that one day he was walking

00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:29.480
through a street in Rome and he was passing
by a bookseller shop.

00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:34.480
And in the bookseller shop there were two
men arguing over a book.

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:37.630
This book, allegedly, was written by Galen.

00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:41.870
So, Galen is overhearing this conversation
about a book that he allegedly wrote.

00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:45.350
One guy is arguing that "this is a book I
just bought from Galen."

00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:48.630
And the other guy is arguing "this book isn't
written by Galen."

00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:49.789
He read the first two lines.

00:22:49.789 --> 00:22:51.870
He said, "This book, the writing style is
all wrong."

00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:57.070
Well, that warmed the cockles of Galen's heart
because he, in fact, had not written the book.

00:22:57.070 --> 00:23:00.559
So, he went home that afternoon and he did
write a book.

00:23:00.559 --> 00:23:02.340
And we have that book still today.

00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:06.169
It's sometimes called "How to Recognize Books
Written by Galen."

00:23:06.169 --> 00:23:07.169
[laughter]

00:23:07.169 --> 00:23:11.330
So, they didn't like the idea of people doing
this.

00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:17.940
So, give you a second example to show you
how forgery was talked about in the ancient

00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:18.940
times.

00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:20.510
This time a Christian book.

00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:24.940
There's a book called the "Apostolic Constitutions."

00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:30.809
It's a book that scholars can date pretty
precisely because of things inside of it to

00:23:30.809 --> 00:23:32.760
around the year 380.

00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:34.990
So, just to set you on the timeline.

00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:41.389
So if Jesus died around year 30, most of the
New Testament books were written between 50

00:23:41.389 --> 00:23:43.880
and 100.

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:45.570
This book is written around the year 380.

00:23:45.570 --> 00:23:48.880
So, that's 300 years after most of the Apostles
were dead.

00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:52.450
It claims though, to be written by the Apostles.

00:23:52.450 --> 00:23:58.220
It's called the "Apostolic Constitutions"
because it describes how the church is to

00:23:58.220 --> 00:23:59.419
be constituted.

00:23:59.419 --> 00:24:01.549
Who should your leaders be?

00:24:01.549 --> 00:24:03.299
What should their qualifications be?

00:24:03.299 --> 00:24:04.419
What should they do?

00:24:04.419 --> 00:24:06.539
How do you perform the baptism ceremony?

00:24:06.539 --> 00:24:07.880
How do you perform the Eucharist?

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:09.600
How do you do things?

00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:14.630
And it's written in the name of the twelve
Apostles after Jesus's death.

00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:17.710
So, whoever wrote it is claiming to be the
Apostles.

00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:19.340
And sometimes, he speaks in the first person.

00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:22.009
I, Peter, say to you this.

00:24:22.009 --> 00:24:23.799
I, Andrews, say to you this.

00:24:23.799 --> 00:24:25.980
I, John, say to you this.

00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:32.290
As if these people are actually talking even
though these people have been dead for 300

00:24:32.290 --> 00:24:33.350
years.

00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:38.149
At the end of the book, near the end of the
book, is a really interesting exhortation.

00:24:38.149 --> 00:24:44.130
Near the end of the book, the author tells
his readers that they should not read books

00:24:44.130 --> 00:24:47.440
that claim to be written by Apostles, but
aren't.

00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:48.600
Wait a second.

00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:49.799
Why would he say that?

00:24:49.799 --> 00:24:50.799
That's what he's doing.

00:24:50.799 --> 00:24:53.419
He's writing a book that's claiming to be
by--, but it's not.

00:24:53.419 --> 00:24:58.240
Well, he's doing it because its reader won't
suspect him of doing what he condemns.

00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:03.330
In other words, he's trying to throw his reader
off the scent of his own deceit.

00:25:03.330 --> 00:25:07.610
So the question is, how widely was forgery
condemned in the ancient world?

00:25:07.610 --> 00:25:10.210
Forgery was condemned in books that are forged.

00:25:10.210 --> 00:25:11.669
That's how widely it was condemned.

00:25:11.669 --> 00:25:14.750
Just about everybody condemned the practice.

00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:18.780
So, are there forgeries in the New Testament?

00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:23.429
Scholars have widely thought that there are
books that are not written by the alleged

00:25:23.429 --> 00:25:26.200
authors in the New Testament.

00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:29.600
Scholars had been reluctant to call these
things forgeries.

00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:31.250
Scholars tend to call these things pseudepigrapha.

00:25:31.250 --> 00:25:37.159
Pseudepigrapha is spelled with a P in the
front.

00:25:37.159 --> 00:25:38.159
Pseudepigrapha.

00:25:38.159 --> 00:25:39.159
P-S-E-U.

00:25:39.159 --> 00:25:40.760
Pseudepigrapha.

00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:43.260
They call them this because they don't wanna
call them forgeries.

00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:47.450
And if you call them pseudepigrapha, it's
a much more antiseptic term.

00:25:47.450 --> 00:25:49.559
They don't tell you what the word pseudepigrapha
means.

00:25:49.559 --> 00:25:52.830
What it means is writings that are inscribed
with a lie.

00:25:52.830 --> 00:25:55.350
So, it's really not much better than forgery.

00:25:55.350 --> 00:25:56.789
But it doesn't sound as bad.

00:25:56.789 --> 00:25:58.930
And so, they call them the pseudepigrapha.

00:25:58.930 --> 00:26:04.020
Scholars have long known, for example, that
whoever wrote 2 Peter, it was not Peter.

00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:06.529
There are debates about 1 Peter.

00:26:06.529 --> 00:26:09.960
A lot of scholars think Peter wrote 1 Peter
and I'm not one of them.

00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:15.980
Doing my research for this book, I decided
there's no way Peter wrote 1 Peter or 2 Peter

00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:18.080
for a very simple reason.

00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:19.700
Peter could not write.

00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:20.809
[laughter]

00:26:20.809 --> 00:26:30.289
So, there have been interesting studies of
literacy in the ancient world that have shown

00:26:30.289 --> 00:26:34.190
that most people were completely illiterate
in the ancient world.

00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:40.380
At the best of times in the ancient world,
maybe 10% of the population could read.

00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:45.850
In Roman Palestine, where Peter grew up, the
literacy rate by the best studies has put

00:26:45.850 --> 00:26:47.920
it somewhere around 3%.

00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:50.880
That's of the people who could read.

00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:54.710
Fewer people could write than could read.

00:26:54.710 --> 00:26:58.440
Because reading and writing are actually separate
exercises, even though we learn them together.

00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:00.510
In the ancient world, they taught them separately.

00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:04.831
So, to be able to write, you had to be really
highly educated.

00:27:04.831 --> 00:27:07.460
And so, who are these 3%?

00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:14.200
They're the upper crust, very wealthy elite,
who are living in cities where they have schools.

00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:16.070
And who was Peter?

00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:23.009
Peter, according to the New Testament was
a lower class fisherman from rural Galilee

00:27:23.009 --> 00:27:24.379
who spoke Aramaic.

00:27:24.379 --> 00:27:29.550
Well, 1 Peter is written in highly rhetorical
Greek.

00:27:29.550 --> 00:27:31.600
Was Peter somebody who would've gotten an
education?

00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:32.600
No way.

00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:37.980
He probably was a fisherman, probably fished
from the time he was a young boy, didn't have

00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:42.059
enough time for school, had no money, wasn't
in a place where they had schools.

00:27:42.059 --> 00:27:44.240
So, Peter did not write 1 Peter.

00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:45.240
I mean, unless--.

00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:49.970
I mean, the only option is that after the
Resurrection, maybe Peter decided to go back

00:27:49.970 --> 00:27:51.710
to school.

00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:55.980
And so he took classes at the Capernaum High
School and for his foreign language class,

00:27:55.980 --> 00:27:58.519
he decided to take Greek.

00:27:58.519 --> 00:28:02.179
And so, he got pretty good at Greek and then
at the end of his life, he learned Greek composition.

00:28:02.179 --> 00:28:05.210
Took some composition courses so that he could
write 1 Peter.

00:28:05.210 --> 00:28:11.899
I mean, it's possible, but people like Peter
had other things on their mind besides learning

00:28:11.899 --> 00:28:12.899
Greek composition.

00:28:12.899 --> 00:28:16.039
I don't think Peter wrote 1 Peter because
I don't think he was literate.

00:28:16.039 --> 00:28:19.760
By the way, the New Testament says that Peter
was illiterate.

00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:24.500
Acts, Chapter Four, Verse 13 literally says
that he could not read.

00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:26.679
So, well, I think he didn't.

00:28:26.679 --> 00:28:29.710
And I don't think that he told somebody else
to write the letter for him, which is the

00:28:29.710 --> 00:28:34.220
solution a lot of scholars have come up with,
that Peter told some scribe, "Write a book

00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:35.860
for me and say this."

00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:37.169
And the guy wrote it down.

00:28:37.169 --> 00:28:41.850
We have no examples of that happening in the
ancient world that can plausibly be applied

00:28:41.850 --> 00:28:42.970
to Peter.

00:28:42.970 --> 00:28:47.519
Whereas we have lots of examples of what I
think is going on here, which is someone later

00:28:47.519 --> 00:28:51.509
who wants you to think he's Peter and so he
claims to be Peter so you'll read his book.

00:28:51.509 --> 00:28:55.309
It's probably somebody who had no reputation,
nobody knew who he was.

00:28:55.309 --> 00:28:59.120
And he couldn't very well write a book in
his own name because nobody would read it.

00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:03.050
So, he wrote his book and he claimed to be
Peter so people would read it and he was highly

00:29:03.050 --> 00:29:04.050
successful.

00:29:04.050 --> 00:29:05.679
The thing ended up in the New Testament.

00:29:05.679 --> 00:29:08.120
I mean, that's as successful as you can get.

00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:09.120
[laughter]

00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:14.470
So 1st and 2nd Peter probably were not written
by Peter.

00:29:14.470 --> 00:29:19.090
There are 13 letters that claim to be written
by Paul in the New Testament.

00:29:19.090 --> 00:29:21.740
Thirteen letters that claim to be written
by Paul.

00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:25.500
Scholars are pretty sure that Paul did not
write six of them.

00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:29.679
Six of them are not really written by Paul,
but by people later claiming to be written

00:29:29.679 --> 00:29:30.690
by Paul.

00:29:30.690 --> 00:29:31.789
What I argue in my book--.

00:29:31.789 --> 00:29:34.770
Oh, by the way, with Paul we're in a better
situation than with Peter.

00:29:34.770 --> 00:29:35.770
Paul could write.

00:29:35.770 --> 00:29:38.289
We've got seven letters from him.

00:29:38.289 --> 00:29:41.190
But if you have seven letters from somebody
and you've got some other letter you're not

00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:44.510
sure about, all you have to do is compare
it with the seven.

00:29:44.510 --> 00:29:49.519
And you look at the writing style, the vocabulary,
the theology that's in it, with the historical

00:29:49.519 --> 00:29:51.080
situation that's presupposed.

00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:54.850
When you do that, these other six don't match
up to the seven very well.

00:29:54.850 --> 00:29:58.289
And so, it's probable that the same author
did not produce them.

00:29:58.289 --> 00:30:01.710
So, you get six letters that are not really
by Paul.

00:30:01.710 --> 00:30:02.919
We call those forgeries.

00:30:02.919 --> 00:30:05.070
Two letters by Peter I would call forgeries.

00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:09.100
The book of James is almost certainly not
written by the brother of Jesus, James.

00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:12.350
Jude was certainly not written by Jesus's
brother, Jude.

00:30:12.350 --> 00:30:17.759
So, there are probably ten, eleven, or twelve
books in the New Testament that are forgeries.

00:30:17.759 --> 00:30:20.450
That's out of 27, over a third of the books.

00:30:20.450 --> 00:30:23.770
So, it's a significant problem.

00:30:23.770 --> 00:30:27.250
Let me just conclude by just saying a word
about what might have been motivating these

00:30:27.250 --> 00:30:34.230
people to write forgeries because it's a special
problem within early Christianity.

00:30:34.230 --> 00:30:40.190
It's a problem because Christians insisted
that God was truth, that Jesus was the way,

00:30:40.190 --> 00:30:44.899
the truth, and the life, that you had to believe
the truth if you're gonna be right with God,

00:30:44.899 --> 00:30:48.309
that as a Christian, you should speak the
truth to one another.

00:30:48.309 --> 00:30:54.710
And so, why would an author who believed that
the truth was important, why would he lie

00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:56.740
about who he was?

00:30:56.740 --> 00:31:01.950
So, the reality is we'll never know what was
motivating these people.

00:31:01.950 --> 00:31:08.870
But I do have a guess that I think is a pretty
good guess, which is this: There are people

00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:14.940
in the ancient world, just as there are people
today, who thought that there are some situations

00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:19.360
in which it was the right thing to do to tell
a lie.

00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:21.510
That sometimes, it's right to lie.

00:31:21.510 --> 00:31:26.499
You, yourself, can imagine situations where
a lie is the appropriate thing to do.

00:31:26.499 --> 00:31:32.460
In the ancient world, people like Plato said
if a doctor has to lie to his patient in order

00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:37.429
to get her to take his medicine, to take her
medicine, that's a good thing.

00:31:37.429 --> 00:31:38.710
That's a good lie.

00:31:38.710 --> 00:31:44.610
Or, if a general is in battle and his troops
are getting beaten and he needs to rally them,

00:31:44.610 --> 00:31:50.450
it's OK to lie to them to say that reinforcements
are coming so that they'll fight more valiantly.

00:31:50.450 --> 00:31:51.580
That's a good lie.

00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:56.730
There are places where it's appropriate and
good to lie.

00:31:56.730 --> 00:32:01.940
It may be that there were ancient authors
who thought that their views of this Christian

00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:08.870
religion were so spot on and so important
and really needed to be widely accepted, that

00:32:08.870 --> 00:32:13.799
it was so important to get this message out
that they were willing to claim to be someone

00:32:13.799 --> 00:32:14.799
that they weren't.

00:32:14.799 --> 00:32:20.990
They were willing to write a book and claim
to be Peter or Paul or John or Matthew or

00:32:20.990 --> 00:32:23.679
Judas or Mary and so forth.

00:32:23.679 --> 00:32:28.499
It's possible that they thought that this
lie was justified because of the importance

00:32:28.499 --> 00:32:29.600
of their message.

00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:36.009
If so, then we have this very interesting
irony that some early Christian authors thought

00:32:36.009 --> 00:32:40.820
that in order to convey the truth, it was
appropriate to tell a lie.

00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:44.520
Thank you very much.

00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:45.520
[applause]

00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:49.639
I can take questions if anybody has any.

00:32:49.639 --> 00:32:50.639
Yes.

00:32:50.639 --> 00:32:55.790
&gt;&gt;MALE #1: Do you have any theories about
the mechanism that was happening.

00:32:55.790 --> 00:32:57.240
I was just trying to--.

00:32:57.240 --> 00:33:00.480
I want a lot of people to read a letter that
I claim comes from Peter.

00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:03.659
Do I send it by mail and say, "Hey, I dug
this up from somewhere.

00:33:03.659 --> 00:33:04.659
It's interesting.

00:33:04.659 --> 00:33:06.360
Maybe, it claims to be from Peter.

00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:11.249
Maybe it is, but I don't know where it came
from."

00:33:11.249 --> 00:33:12.249
What do you think?

00:33:12.249 --> 00:33:13.249
&gt;&gt;Bart Ehrman: Yeah.

00:33:13.249 --> 00:33:14.249
&gt;&gt;MALE #1: Or, what would--?

00:33:14.249 --> 00:33:15.249
&gt;&gt;Bart Ehrman: Yeah.

00:33:15.249 --> 00:33:16.249
Right.

00:33:16.249 --> 00:33:17.249
Right.

00:33:17.249 --> 00:33:18.249
So, there are various mechanisms that we know
about.

00:33:18.249 --> 00:33:19.249
There might be some that we don't know about.

00:33:19.249 --> 00:33:20.249
But we do know about some.

00:33:20.249 --> 00:33:24.290
One involves what you alluded to, the idea
of a discovery, that you discover something.

00:33:24.290 --> 00:33:31.480
And so, the most interesting incidence of
this is in an Apocalypse, a revelation from

00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:34.769
God that comes directly to a person, an Apocalypse.

00:33:34.769 --> 00:33:38.999
In Apocalypse of Paul, where Paul describes--.

00:33:38.999 --> 00:33:43.760
Paul is taken up into Heaven and he sees the
heavenly world and he describes it for his

00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:44.760
readers.

00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:45.919
This book claims to be written by Paul.

00:33:45.919 --> 00:33:48.390
But again, it's from the 4th Century.

00:33:48.390 --> 00:33:53.500
It was written near the end of the 4th Century,
so probably 320 years after Paul is dead.

00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:54.929
But it claims to be written by Paul.

00:33:54.929 --> 00:34:00.210
So, the author, though, had this problem that
he wrote this thing at the end of the 4th

00:34:00.210 --> 00:34:01.210
Century.

00:34:01.210 --> 00:34:02.210
Nobody had ever heard of it before.

00:34:02.210 --> 00:34:06.850
And he wanted to put it in circulation, but
people would ask, “Where's it been?"

00:34:06.850 --> 00:34:11.770
So he actually begins the narrative with a
discovery narrative, in which he says that

00:34:11.770 --> 00:34:18.129
there's a man who is living in the city of
Tarsis, Paul's town, in the end of the 4th

00:34:18.129 --> 00:34:22.820
Century who actually lived in Paul's old house.

00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:24.369
And one night he had a dream.

00:34:24.369 --> 00:34:28.860
An angel came to him in a dream and told him
to dig up the foundations of the house.

00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:30.500
And he ignored the angel.

00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:31.500
Second night.

00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:35.040
The angel comes back, tells him to dig up
the foundations of the house.

00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:36.320
He ignores him.

00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:37.379
Third night.

00:34:37.379 --> 00:34:41.679
Angel comes back, beats him to a bloody pulp
and tells him to dig up the foundation of

00:34:41.679 --> 00:34:42.679
the house.

00:34:42.679 --> 00:34:43.679
And so he does.

00:34:43.679 --> 00:34:44.679
He goes down.

00:34:44.679 --> 00:34:48.619
He digs up the foundations of the house and
he finds a box, a marble box that is sealed

00:34:48.619 --> 00:34:49.619
with lead.

00:34:49.619 --> 00:34:52.250
And so, he doesn't know what to do with it.

00:34:52.250 --> 00:34:55.150
He takes it to the local governor, explains
what happened.

00:34:55.150 --> 00:34:56.440
The governor doesn't want to touch it.

00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:57.730
Takes it to the Roman Emperor.

00:34:57.730 --> 00:35:01.520
The Roman Emperor opens it up and there's
a book inside of it.

00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:04.290
And here's the book.

00:35:04.290 --> 00:35:06.980
And so this explains where the thing has been
for the last 300 years.

00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:09.329
It's been buried in the foundations of this
house.

00:35:09.329 --> 00:35:12.050
So, sometimes you get a discovery narrative.

00:35:12.050 --> 00:35:14.260
You don't get that very often, but sometimes.

00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:16.010
And they're great when you get them.

00:35:16.010 --> 00:35:18.720
The more common thing, I think, was--.

00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:21.880
A couple things to bear in mind.

00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:24.430
First, there is no postal service.

00:35:24.430 --> 00:35:27.850
So, you can't just send it in the mail some
place.

00:35:27.850 --> 00:35:33.700
And second of all, there's no mass production
of books.

00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:39.230
So, somebody writes a book and the only way
to get a copy is for somebody else to copy

00:35:39.230 --> 00:35:40.850
it out by hand, one letter at a time.

00:35:40.850 --> 00:35:45.280
And so, it takes a long time for things to
get copied out.

00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:47.849
And it takes a long time for things to circulate.

00:35:47.849 --> 00:35:51.910
And so, if you don't know of something that
was written ten years ago, that doesn't seem

00:35:51.910 --> 00:35:53.770
odd any longer.

00:35:53.770 --> 00:36:00.360
It's not like if Dan Brown, all of a sudden
a book shows up that Dan Brown published 20

00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:05.720
years ago and nobody ever heard of it, Dan
Brown did not really publish that book.

00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:11.510
But back then, if a letter from Paul shows
up 20 years later, that's not that unusual

00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:13.619
'cause there's not mass--.

00:36:13.619 --> 00:36:19.020
There aren't huge Barnes and Noble selling
these things and stuff.

00:36:19.020 --> 00:36:22.359
So, what you would do.

00:36:22.359 --> 00:36:27.410
Suppose you wanted to claim to be Paul and
you're writing a letter in which you’re

00:36:27.410 --> 00:36:28.410
embracing your views.

00:36:28.410 --> 00:36:29.520
You address it to a church.

00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:33.140
So, you address it to the church of Thessalonica.

00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:35.450
And you make a few copies of it.

00:36:35.450 --> 00:36:42.700
And you give them to travelers and you say,
"We have this letter that we've gotten from--in

00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:43.700
circulation here.

00:36:43.700 --> 00:36:44.700
Take this."

00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:45.700
They take it to Rome.

00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:46.700
Somebody else takes it to Jerusalem.

00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:48.430
Somebody else takes it to Alexandria, Egypt.

00:36:48.430 --> 00:36:53.490
But what you don't do is you don't write it
and then send it to the church in Thessalonica

00:36:53.490 --> 00:36:55.579
because they know they never got this letter.

00:36:55.579 --> 00:36:58.760
So, you send it and it starts circulating.

00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:02.370
And years later, when everybody's dead and
wouldn't know better, there it is.

00:37:02.370 --> 00:37:03.730
So, that's the mechanism probably.

00:37:03.730 --> 00:37:04.730
Yeah.

00:37:04.730 --> 00:37:05.730
&gt;&gt;MALE #2: The other forgery as you described,
they are not of contradiction to the New Testament,

00:37:05.730 --> 00:37:06.730
including the main evangelists.

00:37:06.730 --> 00:37:09.920
So, is there anything good in it?

00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:16.120
&gt;&gt;Bart Ehrman: Is there anything good in the
New Testament?

00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:17.120
[laughter]

00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:20.070
There's a lot of good stuff in the New Testament.

00:37:20.070 --> 00:37:23.470
The New Testament's terrific.

00:37:23.470 --> 00:37:26.520
The New Testament is filled with really interesting
stories.

00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:30.520
For people who are religious, it's been the
basis of the Christian religion for two thousand

00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:31.520
years.

00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:36.030
And so, it has terrific stuff in it.

00:37:36.030 --> 00:37:37.869
It has terrific moral teachings in it.

00:37:37.869 --> 00:37:41.222
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #2: No, I'm just--the
theology of the book.

00:37:41.222 --> 00:37:42.222
Some stuff is forged.

00:37:42.222 --> 00:37:43.550
Some stuff is self-inconsistent.

00:37:43.550 --> 00:37:48.000
&gt;&gt;Bart Ehrman: Yes, there are inconsistencies.

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:50.630
There are writings that are written by people
who claim to be writing them.

00:37:50.630 --> 00:37:54.000
I mean, the seven letters of Paul, for example.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:58.030
Paul's seven letters are really written by
him.

00:37:58.030 --> 00:38:02.309
And they're important historically because
they can tell us what was going on at a certain

00:38:02.309 --> 00:38:04.240
point of time within Christianity.

00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:08.750
So, the New Testament is extremely valuable
historically.

00:38:08.750 --> 00:38:10.920
For many people, it's valuable religiously.

00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:13.579
And I think it contains a lot of important
ethical teachings.

00:38:13.579 --> 00:38:14.579
But you're absolutely right.

00:38:14.579 --> 00:38:17.510
There are a lot of contradictions as well
because different authors had different points

00:38:17.510 --> 00:38:18.510
of view.

00:38:18.510 --> 00:38:23.010
I think the problem with the New Testament
is that people have taken it as a divine book

00:38:23.010 --> 00:38:30.319
and that doesn't hold up under scrutiny because
of the contradictions, because of the forgeries.

00:38:30.319 --> 00:38:34.980
I don't think you can take it as the inherent
revelation from God because it's not that.

00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:36.170
It's a very human book.

00:38:36.170 --> 00:38:38.700
But as human books go, it's really fantastic.

00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:39.840
My opinion.

00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:40.840
Yeah.

00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:46.040
&gt;&gt;MALE #3: You're saying a lot of the stuff
you've been talking about.

00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:49.109
You quote various dates the various books
were written.

00:38:49.109 --> 00:38:52.390
How do you actually arrive at those dates?

00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:56.870
How do know the four gospels were written
between 50 and 100?

00:38:56.870 --> 00:38:57.910
&gt;&gt;Bart Ehrman: Yeah.

00:38:57.910 --> 00:38:58.910
Right.

00:38:58.910 --> 00:38:59.910
Yeah.

00:38:59.910 --> 00:39:00.910
Right.

00:39:00.910 --> 00:39:03.140
It's complicated, but there are scholars who
spend years trying to figure this kind of

00:39:03.140 --> 00:39:04.140
stuff out.

00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:06.700
So I mean, there's actually scholarship involved.

00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:09.740
Give you the short story with the gospels.

00:39:09.740 --> 00:39:15.600
When you have an anonymous text that's a historical
narrative, there are two big things that you're

00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:17.000
looking for.

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:21.119
One thing you're looking for is a reference
to some historical event that you can otherwise

00:39:21.119 --> 00:39:26.540
date, a reference in the text to something
that you know when it happened.

00:39:26.540 --> 00:39:27.540
OK?

00:39:27.540 --> 00:39:34.630
So, if you find some letter today that shows
up that mentions Obama's inauguration, then

00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:38.630
you know that it had to be written after a
certain date, right?

00:39:38.630 --> 00:39:40.390
So, that's one thing you look for.

00:39:40.390 --> 00:39:46.480
The other thing you look for is some author
whom you can absolutely date with precision,

00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:48.400
who quotes a book.

00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:53.690
So, if you get those two things, you get the
time after which it had to be written and

00:39:53.690 --> 00:39:55.349
the time before which it had to be written.

00:39:55.349 --> 00:39:58.390
So, you get a range.

00:39:58.390 --> 00:40:03.920
With the gospels there are certain things
that you can say with absolute certainty.

00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:07.150
For example, the gospels all talk about Pontius
Pilate.

00:40:07.150 --> 00:40:11.869
We know that Pontius Pilate was the governor
of Judea between 26 and 36 of the Common Era

00:40:11.869 --> 00:40:13.390
from other historical records.

00:40:13.390 --> 00:40:21.010
So, the gospels are written after 36, or sometime
after the 30s.

00:40:21.010 --> 00:40:27.369
There is a reference in the Gospel of Luke
to the city of Jerusalem being surrounded

00:40:27.369 --> 00:40:33.900
by gentile troops and being trampled down
by the gentiles and the temple being destroyed.

00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:35.890
Well, we know when that happened.

00:40:35.890 --> 00:40:37.830
It happened in the year 70.

00:40:37.830 --> 00:40:42.630
So, Luke was probably written sometime after
the year 70.

00:40:42.630 --> 00:40:46.250
Luke gets quoted in the early 2nd Century
by church fathers we can date.

00:40:46.250 --> 00:40:49.090
So, it's sometime before the early 2nd Century.

00:40:49.090 --> 00:40:51.740
So, you narrow it down like that.

00:40:51.740 --> 00:40:54.300
So, that's basically how you do it.

00:40:54.300 --> 00:40:55.300
Yeah.

00:40:55.300 --> 00:40:57.960
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #1: Any guesses about who was doing
this?

00:40:57.960 --> 00:41:01.650
Because like you said, that literacy rate
was so rare.

00:41:01.650 --> 00:41:04.770
So was it clergy members or the elite?

00:41:04.770 --> 00:41:05.940
Was it officials?

00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:07.109
&gt;&gt;Bart Ehrman: Yeah.

00:41:07.109 --> 00:41:08.109
Who's doing it?

00:41:08.109 --> 00:41:09.109
Right.

00:41:09.109 --> 00:41:11.240
And how much of it is a conspiracy?

00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:12.310
[laughter]

00:41:12.310 --> 00:41:16.650
So, we don't know.

00:41:16.650 --> 00:41:18.230
When we have something like--.

00:41:18.230 --> 00:41:23.740
Well, the six letters of Paul that weren't
really written by Paul, three of them are

00:41:23.740 --> 00:41:25.099
written by the same guy.

00:41:25.099 --> 00:41:30.510
That can be shown on literary, linguistic
grounds that the same person wrote 1 and 2

00:41:30.510 --> 00:41:31.980
Timothy and Titus.

00:41:31.980 --> 00:41:33.970
But we don't know who he is.

00:41:33.970 --> 00:41:39.069
What we do know about him is that he's a Greek-speaking
Christian who is a follower of Paul, who's

00:41:39.069 --> 00:41:41.220
living outside of Palestine.

00:41:41.220 --> 00:41:45.980
And usually he's dated to about 20 or 30 years
later, but this is a case where it's hard

00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:46.980
to know.

00:41:46.980 --> 00:41:49.079
It might be 40 or 50 years later.

00:41:49.079 --> 00:41:51.540
It's hard to get the date.

00:41:51.540 --> 00:41:58.109
He is very concerned with the correct organization
of the church, which might suggest that, in

00:41:58.109 --> 00:42:03.310
fact, he's a leader of a church himself because
he lays out all the qualifications what the

00:42:03.310 --> 00:42:06.290
leader ought to be, what the duties of leaders
ought to be.

00:42:06.290 --> 00:42:10.470
And so, it seems that that's one of his vested
interests, so maybe he's a church leader.

00:42:10.470 --> 00:42:12.540
So, that's about all you can say.

00:42:12.540 --> 00:42:13.559
Greek speaking.

00:42:13.559 --> 00:42:14.559
Highly educated.

00:42:14.559 --> 00:42:16.280
Greek speaking.

00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:21.290
Christian who is an admirer of Paul, living
outside of Palestine who is particularly interested

00:42:21.290 --> 00:42:23.809
in church--probably a bishop with a church
someplace.

00:42:23.809 --> 00:42:26.010
So, you can do that kind of thing with most
of these books.

00:42:26.010 --> 00:42:32.640
But you can't ever say, "Yeah, it was Jehoshaphat,
this guy who lived in Syria."

00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:33.640
We don't have any names.

00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:34.640
Yeah.

00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:39.510
&gt;&gt;MALE #4: You were saying your search about
some that aren't written, or I guess forged,

00:42:39.510 --> 00:42:45.554
and then you keep saying these seven books
about Paul that you know are certain.

00:42:45.554 --> 00:42:46.554
What makes you so certain about these seven?

00:42:46.554 --> 00:42:47.554
&gt;&gt;Bart Ehrman: Why be certain about the seven?

00:42:47.554 --> 00:42:52.760
So, the seven are called the undisputed Pauline
epistles because there aren't scholars who

00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:53.810
dispute these seven.

00:42:53.810 --> 00:42:57.480
I mean, every now and then someone will come
along and dispute them because he has to get

00:42:57.480 --> 00:43:02.339
tenure and he's--

00:43:02.339 --> 00:43:03.339
[laughter]

00:43:03.339 --> 00:43:04.339
So, he'll write something.

00:43:04.339 --> 00:43:08.859
The reason is that you have these 13 letters.

00:43:08.859 --> 00:43:11.740
Seven of them cohere together extremely well.

00:43:11.740 --> 00:43:14.040
Writing style is similar.

00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:15.390
Theological views are similar.

00:43:15.390 --> 00:43:17.150
Vocabulary used is similar.

00:43:17.150 --> 00:43:19.200
They're addressing different situations.

00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:24.510
And so, there are a lot of differences among
them, but they cohere together as a group

00:43:24.510 --> 00:43:27.130
of letters that appear to be written by the
same person.

00:43:27.130 --> 00:43:32.880
So, since all 13 of them claim they were written
by Paul and you have seven that are from one

00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:37.549
person--the other six, three are written by
somebody who's not the same as the seven.

00:43:37.549 --> 00:43:40.250
The other three are all written by different
persons.

00:43:40.250 --> 00:43:44.660
So you've got one, two, three, four, five
authors.

00:43:44.660 --> 00:43:47.900
One of the authors has the most things.

00:43:47.900 --> 00:43:53.480
And the things that are talked about in these
seven appear most likely to be things that

00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:56.460
were happening early in Christianity, rather
than in later decades.

00:43:56.460 --> 00:43:57.690
And so, since they all come to be by Paul,
everybody just assumes it's Paul who was writing

00:43:57.690 --> 00:43:58.690
these.

00:43:58.690 --> 00:43:59.690
We might be wrong.

00:43:59.690 --> 00:44:00.690
It might have been someone else.

00:44:00.690 --> 00:44:01.690
But it seems plausible that it's Paul.

00:44:01.690 --> 00:44:02.690
Yeah.

00:44:02.690 --> 00:44:06.510
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #2: So, you were talking about how
you think that 1 Peter wasn't actually written

00:44:06.510 --> 00:44:08.270
by him.

00:44:08.270 --> 00:44:21.069
You said that, well, the New Testament says
that Peter was illiterate, but how do you

00:44:21.069 --> 00:44:22.250
know that that's true?

00:44:22.250 --> 00:44:23.250
&gt;&gt;Bart Ehrman: Oh, yeah.

00:44:23.250 --> 00:44:27.420
I don't base my view that Peter was illiterate
on a verse in Acts Chapter 4, verse 13.

00:44:27.420 --> 00:44:33.710
I'm just pointing out that it's not just some
crazy liberal wide-eyed professor in Chapel

00:44:33.710 --> 00:44:35.430
Hill who's claiming that Peter was illiterate.

00:44:35.430 --> 00:44:38.900
In fact, it was known in the ancient world
that he was illiterate.

00:44:38.900 --> 00:44:41.400
So, I don't use that as proof that he was
illiterate.

00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:45.740
It's just it is interesting that the scholarly
view that he's illiterate is actually something

00:44:45.740 --> 00:44:47.420
that the Bible itself says.

00:44:47.420 --> 00:44:48.420
That's all I mean by that.

00:44:48.420 --> 00:44:49.420
Yeah.

00:44:49.420 --> 00:44:50.420
&gt;&gt;MALE #6: In all of your research on various
writings that have been forged, have you come

00:44:50.420 --> 00:44:56.220
across anything that peers through the looking-glass
the other way?

00:44:56.220 --> 00:45:03.730
Like, things that are genuine that never made
it into the Bible, or kinda have been lost

00:45:03.730 --> 00:45:04.730
to iniquity.

00:45:04.730 --> 00:45:05.730
&gt;&gt;Bart Ehrman: Yeah, yeah.

00:45:05.730 --> 00:45:06.990
That's a good question.

00:45:06.990 --> 00:45:11.930
So, there's nothing by the Apostles that's
outside of the New Testament that should've

00:45:11.930 --> 00:45:12.930
been put in.

00:45:12.930 --> 00:45:16.170
Because, again, most of these Apostles couldn't
write anyway.

00:45:16.170 --> 00:45:19.431
We have other letters that claim they were
written by Paul outside the New Testament

00:45:19.431 --> 00:45:24.130
that were certainly not written by Paul.

00:45:24.130 --> 00:45:27.000
We do have orthonymous writing.

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:31.619
Orthonymous is the word for a writing that
actually is written by the guy who's claiming

00:45:31.619 --> 00:45:32.619
to write it.

00:45:32.619 --> 00:45:38.390
So, we do have orthonymous writings from outside
the New Testament that are very valuable,

00:45:38.390 --> 00:45:42.410
some of which were almost included in the
New Testament.

00:45:42.410 --> 00:45:51.170
We have seven letters by a bishop of Antioch
in Syria, a guy named Ignatius.

00:45:51.170 --> 00:45:55.350
Seven letters written soon after the books
of the New Testament.

00:45:55.350 --> 00:46:00.940
One book that almost made it in is a very
long book.

00:46:00.940 --> 00:46:05.000
It's longer than any books of the New Testament
that is a kind of a revelation that's given

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:10.480
to a guy named Hermas, the Shepherd of Hermas,
that even in the 1st Century, some church

00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:12.790
fathers thought should be in the New Testament.

00:46:12.790 --> 00:46:14.220
But eventually, it was excluded.

00:46:14.220 --> 00:46:17.490
It's was probably excluded because it's just
so long.

00:46:17.490 --> 00:46:18.490
[laughter]

00:46:18.490 --> 00:46:23.750
And it's really frankly a bit boring that
I think people just decided not to mess with

00:46:23.750 --> 00:46:24.829
this thing anymore.

00:46:24.829 --> 00:46:30.250
But there's nothing by Apostles that we have
outside the New Testament.

00:46:30.250 --> 00:46:31.250
Yeah.

00:46:31.250 --> 00:46:32.250
Any other questions?

00:46:32.250 --> 00:46:33.250
OK.

00:46:33.250 --> 00:46:34.250
Well, thank you very much.

00:46:34.250 --> 00:46:36.119
I've enjoyed being with you.

00:46:36.119 --> 00:46:36.599
[applause]
