could be chaos right so there's there's

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670
could be chaos right so there's there's
 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.220
could be chaos right so there's there's
two problems that come up there and this

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230
two problems that come up there and this
 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.840
two problems that come up there and this
is where Andrews book is interesting

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850
is where Andrews book is interesting
 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.790
is where Andrews book is interesting
because problem number one is that the

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800
because problem number one is that the
 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.170
because problem number one is that the
people will be poor they won't have a

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180
people will be poor they won't have a
 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.150
people will be poor they won't have a
source of income ubi solves that the

trillions of dollars to the budget every
 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.210
trillions of dollars to the budget every
year and we could solve that I'm still

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220
year and we could solve that I'm still
 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.530
