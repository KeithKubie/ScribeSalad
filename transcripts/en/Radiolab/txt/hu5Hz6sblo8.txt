Speaker 1:          00:01          Leadership support for more perfect is provided by the Joyce Foundation. This is more perfect series about the supreme court. I'm Jed up and Rod. In February of 2017 Supreme Court, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said something that surprised a lot of people.

Speaker 2:          00:18          Well, I would say that we are not experiencing the best of times.

Speaker 1:          00:24          She stepped straight into the political fray and addressed this political moment.

Speaker 2:          00:28          It was a great man. Once said that the true symbol of the United States is not the Bald Eagle. It is the

Speaker 3:          00:40          pendulum, and when the pendulum swings too far in one direction, it will go back. Some terrible things have happened in the United States that one can only hope that we learn from those bad things.

Speaker 1:          01:01          Today we're going to ride the pendulum to the dark side. I'm going to start with one of the most infamous decisions the court has ever made. The Korematsu decision, right? You might imagine it's not going to be the happiest of situations, but the story that we're going to tell you today and tomorrow as well, actually, they're not stories, a bitterness because this curious thing happens in both cases when our characters can't find justice inside the Supreme Court, you stop looking for it there.

Speaker 3:          01:35          Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:36          And they find it somewhere else entirely. Producer Julia Longoria starts us off. [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          01:48          the year is 1967 and the place is San Lorenzo high school in the East Bay of California.

Speaker 3:          01:57          No school day.

Speaker 1:          01:59          We're in a US history classroom. I was actually a junior in high school. This is Karen Korematsu. I'm the executive director and founder of the Fred t Komatsu Institute in San Francisco. So on this particular day, Karen is sitting at the back of the classroom and our teacher had assigned each of my classmates a little paperback book to read, you know, books about American history, government. And the assignment was to then get up in front of the class and give an oral book report. I mean this is a long time ago. So that's the way they used to do things. I don't even remember what my, my book was or my subject, but, but Karen said she was just sitting there in class listening as one by one. Her classmates got up, talked about George Washington or Abraham Lincoln or whatever. And then my friend Maya, who is a Japanese American third generation like myself, got up in front of the class and her book was called Concentration Camps USA, about the Japanese American internment. And I thought, no, that's interesting. I hadn't heard about that before. What's that? About? Maya's book report when something like this

Speaker 2:          03:15          in 1941 divided states of America was attack and the president, President Roosevelt as commander in chief had to respond.

Speaker 5:          03:26          I have to erect it, let him all the measure eyes be taken. [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          03:30          so in terms of defense, one of the big questions for Roosevelt was what happens if the Japanese [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          03:35          fade? The continental us

Speaker 5:          03:39          America sounding on a long,

Speaker 2:          03:41          they'd probably come in on the west coast and you had more than a hundred thousand Japanese Americans living on the west coast. Like would they turn against the United States? They didn't know. And so her friend Maya explained to them [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          03:55          class on February 19th, 1942 President Roosevelt issued executive order nine oh six six that gave

Speaker 2:          04:03          the military the authority to forcibly remove any one of Japanese ancestry from the west coast,

Speaker 5:          04:10          said as soon as an aliens or like what happened to move.

Speaker 2:          04:13          She goes on to explain these, the horrific circumstances and how you know, 120,000 people of Japanese ancestry had been, you know, forcibly removed from their homes. She explained they were put into these detention camps really without any due process of law. But then she went on to say,

Speaker 1:          04:33          but there was this one man who refused to go to the camps and he was arrested and he sued the government and took his case all the way to the supreme court. And then he became LM Mark's Poom court case. And that man's name is Fred Korematsu. Oh, I said to myself, that's my name. She says the class got really quiet and I had 35 pairs eyes turned around and looking at me. Okay. Yes. She thought my last name is Corp Matsu. My Dad's name is Fred, but no way. There's no way it's my dad. Someone would've told me. So of course, and I go running home and confronting my mother and asking her, what does she say? Well, I got the standard to answer, uh, wait until your father gets home and you can ask him that voice you heard. By the way, it was Ellie, Ms Doll or legal editor. And by the time he, uh, had got home, it was eight o'clock in the evening. And so that's a long time after, you know, three 30 in the afternoon. And I calmed down a little bit and I asked him and, and he said, uh, it happened a long time ago. And what he did, he thought was right and the government was wrong

Speaker 1:          05:52          and it was at clear and simple. I could just see this hurt going over his face and I just couldn't ask him any more questions. Karen says, it wasn't until years later that she learned what really happened and why her dad never wanted to talk about it.

Speaker 6:          06:14          Well, I was a 21 then.

Speaker 1:          06:18          This is Fred Korematsu. It's tape of him from the denture archives

Speaker 6:          06:22          and I was up on the hill Sunday morning, but my girlfriend

Speaker 1:          06:27          and Fred story starts out on a date.

Speaker 6:          06:30          You know when you're that age, you know you have a girlfriend just like anybody else. And then she was more important to me than anything.

Speaker 1:          06:38          Fred and his girlfriend, Ida, are driving in the hills above San Francisco looking down on the city, the Golden Gate Bridge. He'd been dating this girl for a while now. She, she was Caucasian, Italian American. Most of his friends were Caucasian

Speaker 6:          06:51          and we were in a car and we were deciding what to do with such a nice day. Either go picnicking or something like that. And then all of a sudden I heard, yeah,

Speaker 5:          07:00          we interrupt this program to bring you a special newest product to the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. Hawaii bite, eh brother than rose has Justin.

Speaker 6:          07:08          He came on the air and your car radio

Speaker 7:          07:10          calm without electrifying. No little crowds right now gather to the front of the White House, State Department and the company then. But the,

Speaker 6:          07:18          and I was quite shocked.

Speaker 1:          07:20          Both were, Fred knew there was a war on and that the U S was likely to get involved. He'd even tried to enlist in the u s military, but was denied because he was Japanese American and he said, sitting there, one of his first thoughts was, why does it have to be Japan? Okay?

Speaker 6:          07:37          Some country was going to attack the alarm, Bro. I wish it was Russia. You know, I just thought about that. You know, I was better with Japan to having this happen. So I took her home and then I went home

Speaker 3:          07:55          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          07:56          so he gets home.

Speaker 6:          07:58          My parents were all shocked. They were all sitting around the living room.

Speaker 1:          08:03          The house is just in despair. His mom is in tears.

Speaker 6:          08:07          They were proud of being Japanese, you know, they obeyed the law. They did everything that supposed to, and then to have this happen, it put them in shame. It was even hard to talk to them after that.

Speaker 1:          08:24          Fred had a traditional immigrant, Japanese American family. His parents were born in Japan, and then all his brothers were born here in the u s born in Oakland, California. He was the third out of four brothers and being the third, not the second or the first that mattered. Absolutely. Fred was an innate position as the third son. He could resist. We asked Lorraine Banai, I teach at Seattle University School of law for some context. She's a law professor and a friend of Fred's family. The cultural tradition

Speaker 8:          08:56          is that the first son is the favored son. The oldest was going to inherit the family garden and nursery business. The second would help out with that business. Fred as the third son, was very low on the totem pole. His parents didn't have the same expectations of him, relatively speaking. He was kind of off the hook. Unlike his older brothers, he didn't speak much Japanese and he felt more American than anything else.

Speaker 6:          09:21          When I was in school, we started each day with the pledge of allegiance. I studied American history. I've always been a good American citizen. So when he came home that Sunday when Pearl Harbor was attacked, his family's response to the whole thing was unsettling. I, um, I didn't know what to do. And Fred says pretty soon after things got very weird. Within a few days they put spotlights on the whole nursery at night and they had a guard standing right here in our home there round. We're on the fence, they're watching us cause I went out one night to have a cigarette and I were standing on a part and I lit a cigarette and a guard. Yeah, bother. If I was signaling somebody, they're ridiculous. Then came Roosevelt's executive order.

Speaker 9:          10:11          Okay,

Speaker 8:          10:12          big order nine oh six six authorize the military to make a series of smaller ones. The first set of orders was a curfew order saying that Japanese, Italian, and German, this were subject to her curfew. The second order was a freeze order directed just at the Japanese on the west coast. They weren't allowed to leave the area and then the third order wasn't ordered that they could not remain on the west coast except for in the custody of an approved location by the army. All persons of Japanese descent were required to move with them. There were about 15 of these assembly centers and Japanese Americans were told to report to one of these centers by a certain date.

Speaker 6:          10:52          Native evacuation notice came, Fred's family began to scramble. They had the worry about what they were going to take, what was going to happen to the nursery. So especially when my mother, you know, the tension and worries. So in the days before his family left, Fred made a decision. Me being the third son, you know, I, um, I had my own worries. I had mom, girlfriend mio and problems. He decided not to go with his family. I, um, talked to them that, uh, that I didn't want to leave. I won't leave with you. You didn't want to leave Ida behind any thought. Maybe the two of them could make a break for it later on. Leave the state before the evacuation deadline. And, um, they said, fine, if you can do it, go ahead.

Speaker 8:          11:46          He was the third son. So he knew that his older brothers would be able to take care of the family and they said he was a grownup and he should make his own decisions. And so he did.

Speaker 2:          11:58          He went off and got his own apartment and his own job as a welder and kind of lived under the radar. He knew his brothers would be there to take care of his parents.

Speaker 6:          12:08          If you're with a family, like my family or any Japanese family, you feel the pressure and the sadness

Speaker 10:         12:21          [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          12:21          but on the outside is definitely just like a normal wipe, you know? Just like we've been living all the time.

Speaker 10:         12:29          Yeah.

Speaker 6:          12:30          I felt right at home, you know as well. I had got, I'm an American citizen too, you know?

Speaker 10:         12:37          [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          12:38          I didn't feel guilty because I don't think I did anything wrong.

Speaker 10:         12:43          No ma'am.

Speaker 8:          12:45          Do you have a sense that he was politically aware at this point? If you're asking me about whether he refused to go as an act of political resistance, I don't think initially, unconsciously he probably knew that what was happening to Japanese Americans was wrong, but I don't think he had the words for it that we might have today.

Speaker 10:         13:10          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          13:10          it's on his way home from work. One day that he reads in the newspaper about his parents and all the other Japanese Americans in the area. Being taken away to camp

Speaker 6:          13:19          made me sick to my stomach, you know, I can see my parents going in, you know, and my brother's climbed into camp and uh, I'm not there, you know, but that was the only time that I felt kind of lonely, you know, like, well, what am I going to do now? You know,

Speaker 2:          13:44          it begins to slowly dawn on him what he's done by staying in the bay area. He is officially breaking the law and he and Ida aren't sure what that means. Like will they be thrown in jail or worse? He talks in the archives about how he's worried and Ida's worry too because now he could get arrested. So they start to think about their options. Fred decides to get an ID with a Spanish sounding last name on it so we won't be recognized as Japanese. And then Ida says, essentially that might not be enough.

Speaker 6:          14:16          She pulled out an article regarding the plastic surgery and uh, she says, what do you think of this? I looked it over and well, I didn't think it was a good idea,

Speaker 8:          14:31          but she said, hey, why don't you think about this? This might be a good thing that will allow you to stay here. So the idea would be that he, you know, have his eyes doubled or something like that, a plastic surgery procedure where you put a fold in the eyelid, so you look more white, less Japanese.

Speaker 6:          14:51          Then she says, do you think at work? And I said, I don't know. Well, she says, shall we look into it? And um, why is that? Then Ma'am got anything to lose? So we decided to try it.

Speaker 3:          15:12          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          15:12          so Fred gets into his car and he drives into the city, into San Francisco, and he just stops in front of the doctor's office

Speaker 8:          15:24          and he starts pacing, walking up the steps of this victory

Speaker 11:         15:28          Korean, and then

Speaker 8:          15:30          walking down the steps to leave thinking this was a really crummy idea. And then walking back up the steps thinking, well yeah, maybe I just right, it's a good idea. And the down the steps, this is a ridiculous idea. Giving some doctor your hard earned money to change your face.

Speaker 12:         15:49          So he goes up and down and up and down and up and down until

Speaker 2:          15:58          you decided to just

Speaker 1:          15:59          go in and have the procedure done.

Speaker 8:          16:03          He really did it as a way to protect them as they try to leave the state.

Speaker 2:          16:08          The doctor said he was going to work on his eyes and then also fix a broken nose.

Speaker 6:          16:12          I had a broken nose from playing football and I never had it fixed and um, said he could do pretty good work on me,

Speaker 2:          16:21          but it turned out he didn't do everything he said he would.

Speaker 6:          16:24          Well you just took my money. That's what it was. I actually, there wasn't anything change except I didn't have a broken nose anymore.

Speaker 2:          16:35          So he drives back to the East Bay with a new nose, but the same eyes. And shortly after that day at the doctor's office, he's out buying cigarettes at a convenience store and a clerk

Speaker 8:          16:48          recognized him and reported him. And one day walking down the street

Speaker 11:         16:53          was stopped and arrested,

Speaker 3:          16:57          um,

Speaker 8:          16:58          and spent his memorial day in 1942 in the San Leandro jail.

Speaker 6:          17:05          When we got caught, they called her into yeah. And um, I seen the police chief talking to her for quite a while.

Speaker 2:          17:21          I imagine it's a small jail and he's just been admitted. So He's sitting in the lobby and he sees Ida come in to the front desk.

Speaker 3:          17:28          Wow.

Speaker 2:          17:28          He's just out of earshot. He can't make out exactly what they're saying, but at a certain point they stopped talking

Speaker 8:          17:35          and she just walks out.

Speaker 6:          17:37          So that was the end of it. I never did see her again. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          17:54          he never saw each other again. So he's sitting there alone in the San Leandro jail and they ended up transferring him to Oakland jail for some reason. And then he ends up at the federal prison in San Francisco because resisting the order was a federal offense.

Speaker 6:          18:18          Anyway. Um, one day I got a call from the guard and told me I had a visitor and I didn't know who it was. You know, I knew all my friends were in Kane or they were in the military.

Speaker 1:          18:35          Fred goes down to the visiting room anyway, and there's this man there.

Speaker 6:          18:40          Hi, I'm a New Yorker.

Speaker 3:          18:43          Hello.

Speaker 6:          18:44          I believe in civil liberties and when the right of people is being denied, this is something that I'm concerned about. The man says his name is Ernest [inaudible], and then he was a very nice foul, easy to talk to. You ask me if I need some cigarettes or something like that, you know, just to break the ice. By the way, I asked him, who do you represent? And earnest responds, well [inaudible] and I thought it was maybe one church or something like that.

Speaker 3:          19:20          See,

Speaker 1:          19:21          we have no way of knowing what exactly was said between Fred and Ernest [inaudible]. Both men have passed away, but it seems like something important must have happened in this conversation because if, as Laurie Banai says, I don't think he had the words for it that we might have today. Fred didn't have. People would think the language of resistance before this moment. Something in that conversation must have given it to him because when Ernest Bassett asked him, do you want me to represent you in a court of law? Fred says, yes. What do you imagine the words were that might've turned him in that moment? I imagine that best seg must've said to Fred, we think that what's happened to Japanese Americans is unconstitutional. We'd like to bring a lawsuit to say the Japanese Americans are being sent away only because of their race. And in that he gave Fred language.

Speaker 3:          20:31          I think Fred knew what's wrong. [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          20:48          basic tried to get Fred out of jail, but the military stepped in and said he had to join his family and camp. They were at a place called tamper and racetracks. It was a temporary holding spot. So that meant that the first place that Fred went after jail was a converted horse stall.

Speaker 6:          21:08          I opened the door and uh, there's gapping holes on the walls. The wind just blew in there. The desk blew in there and everything.

Speaker 8:          21:16          And this was a small horse doll because Fred had asked for his own, you wanted to sit and think about what to say to his family. We're also at Tam Fran. He sat and looked at the single loan bare light bulb above and the smell of manure and hey,

Speaker 6:          21:33          I mean it's made for horses, not for human beings.

Speaker 3:          21:41          [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          21:42          and then all of a sudden I hear a knock on the door and I opened it. It was my brother. He says, Hey, you can't stay here. You, you gotta come and see the pokes.

Speaker 3:          21:57          [inaudible]

Speaker 8:          21:57          so we walked spread over to the store where his family's been living

Speaker 6:          22:02          and I was surprised the way they fixed up their style. They filled up all the cracks and they put newspaper photo wall papered it all up.

Speaker 2:          22:16          This was a common thing for these families. Thousands of them were transferred to more permanent camps and many stayed there for up to three years. Over time,

Speaker 8:          22:26          the community kind of tried to build lives for themselves. You hear stories and see pictures of people building small Japanese gardens out of what they found in the area. He saw newsreels about the people who made the desert bloom.

Speaker 3:          22:50          [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 8:          22:51          we eventually saw people forming, you know, baseball teams.

Speaker 3:          23:07          [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          23:22          yeah, my brother, he was involved in various Japanese activities and uh, he thought it might be a good idea for me to get some suggestions and opinions regarding to, uh, if I should find the case or not.

Speaker 8:          23:43          So Fred's brother calls a meeting,

Speaker 2:          23:45          he got about 30 young people together, I imagine it was like in a mess hall or something like that. And they discussed Fred's case.

Speaker 6:          23:53          They were discussion at to themselves or little groups and I stood around and waited for someone to speak, but no one actually came up to speak to me.

Speaker 2:          24:20          I can see Fred kind of standing in a corner as people are gathered in small groups whispering to each other, stealing glances at them, but no one says a word to him.

Speaker 3:          24:48          Uh,

Speaker 6:          24:50          finally one day. And you said Fred, uh, were undecided on if I should fight the case or not because they didn't want to make any more disturbance.

Speaker 3:          25:03          Okay.

Speaker 6:          25:04          Anything to upset the parents right at this time because they were too upset already and being just being an end cap.

Speaker 2:          25:12          They told them their parents had been through enough, leaving their lives behind. Basically they said, we can't help you, but there was one Japanese American group that did decide to say something about Fred's case.

Speaker 10:         25:32          What's the name of the group? J a. C L. Ernest

Speaker 2:          25:37          spastic had a nickname for this group, the Japanese American Citizens League,

Speaker 10:         25:41          the Jackal's I met, who is the leadership of that group? Several of them. I urge them to oppose the exclusion, but they didn't seem to be particularly interested.

Speaker 1:          25:56          The JACL condemned Fred's case and anyone else who fought against the government orders said it would not support any of these individuals who were fighting the orders and called them self-styled martyrs. Wow. They use that phrase. Yes. They would basically get everyone else into trouble

Speaker 6:          26:16          to do this by myself. I just wonder if I was doing wrong or maybe putting them in shame by, uh, bringing the issue up again. Uh, because of Japanese people, they, they're peaceful people and they, they like to leave things alone if they can because they were in enough trouble as it is because of this Pearl Harbor attack and the country blame them. And so they had this sort of a guilty complex, even though, uh, they had nothing to do with it. Majority, I'm just avoided me. So therefore, I, uh, assume that, uh, uh,

Speaker 10:         27:02          [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          27:02          that I got myself in this problem and, uh, therefore it was my problem and not theirs.

Speaker 10:         27:15          [inaudible]

Speaker 13:         27:15          Fred continued to fight his case. He argued that basically rounding up thousands of Japanese Americans, American citizens without a trial, without due process, basically amounted to racial discrimination. His case made its way up and down the courts. And eventually, two and a half years after he'd met Ernest Basset in that jail cell, the case arrives at the Supreme Court.

Speaker 1:          27:46          You, he, he thought that by the time his case got to the Supreme Court, that's Fred's daughter care. And again, he would be able to vindicate his family and everyone that had been incarcerated, right? I mean, that's how much he believed in the Supreme Court. And so when, when that didn't happen, he felt like if he felt like it was his fault,

Speaker 10:         28:07          yeah,

Speaker 1:          28:08          that's a big burden to carry around.

Speaker 1:          28:12          What ends up happening is on December 18th, 1944 the supreme court ruled against Fred. It's kind of a complicated decision. The Supreme Court said racial distinctions when the government is making racial distinction, it's serious. We need to look at this very, very carefully. And that was a big precedent. So in a lot of ways it's kind of a victory for people fighting racial discrimination. But then the court turned around and said, even though racial distinctions are serious, this one is not strictly racial. We're at war with the Japanese empire. Therefore rounding up Japanese American citizens is a way to defend the nation.

Speaker 14:         29:04          Kind. A few, Fred, at this point like it sounds like it sounds like lonelier than I can almost imagine because you're, you're by yourself pretty much on all fronts, the country that you feel. So a part of that you want to actually enlist in the military to fight for doesn't seem to want you at that moment. Your own community doesn't seem to want you. Your family is ashamed by you. Your girlfriend is gone.

Speaker 10:         29:31          [inaudible]

Speaker 14:         29:32          I can't imagine being more alone at this point.

Speaker 1:          29:34          And he never shared that with my brother or I, he shared it with my mother, but, but we didn't, that wasn't part of our dinner conversation.

Speaker 10:         29:47          [inaudible]

Speaker 15:         29:48          they're discussing drafting a proposal to reinstate a registry for immigrants from Muslim countries and perfectly perfectly honestly say it'll hold constitutional muster. We did it during World War II with Japanese, which you know, call what you will. Maybe you ban. We're not proposing. We go back to the days of internment camps. I go, no, no, no. I'm not proposing that at all, Megan. But what I am saying we need to protect America. That's the kind of stuff that gets people scare Carl. Right. But I'm just saying there is precedent for it and I'm not saying I agree with it.

Speaker 16:         30:18          This is the crazy thing about the core Matson decision. It is still on the books.

Speaker 1:          30:25          That Guy Carl Higbee got on Megan Kelly and said this stuff about Korematsu and the very next day he got on and apologize for saying that, but he's right core Matsu is technically still good law. Justice Antonin Scalia one said that, sure core Matsu was wrongly decided, but if you think that it's not going to happen again, you're kidding yourself.

Speaker 17:         30:48          The court isn't going to get this across the precedent in international American say.

Speaker 18:         30:56          Would you like it too? Um, I think so. Um, would you like it to know

Speaker 1:          31:05          that's not entered in school yet? It's a judge named Richard Posner and at the time the Ellie talked to him, he was on the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals and he was widely considered by people on both the left and the right to be one of the most influential judges in the country. He sometimes called the 10 Supreme Court justice and he's a big defender of the Korematsu decision.

Speaker 18:         31:26          What do you say then to Fred Komatsu? What do you say then to, to a Japanese American about kind of the law and the court?

Speaker 17:         31:33          Well, they were given compensation.

Speaker 18:         31:38          Right. I mean there's, there's, you know, the, there is, you know, pain and suffering there is there, there is an anguish, right, that we can't exactly commodify.

Speaker 17:         31:48          Uh, yeah. But um, at the time it all happened shortly after Pearl Harbor. It seemed like the right thing to do and it probably was the right thing to do. And I imagine that the officials and federal government, and I'm 1941, they probably didn't know anything about Japanese Americans on the west coast. I think Roosevelt had ever met a Japanese American. Right. Doubt it. Right.

Speaker 18:         32:19          Thanks for that. You know, the fact that he hadn't ever met anybody might've been a reason for him to be more restrained in his executive orders, right?

Speaker 17:         32:28          No, because all he cares about is the defense of the United States. If there's any possibility of Japanese American somehow cooperating with the invasion force, then he has to move the Japanese Americans. That's, that's, I'm sure that's all he would've thought of. Right. I mean I think it's all he did think of, but what else could he have thought of? That's the only thing he is going to focus on. And if he does and he could be impeached.

Speaker 18:         33:03          Well he could also worry about citizens. Right. And I think one of the,

Speaker 17:         33:06          no, no, no, no. Look you're not. You're missing the priorities. The priority is defense. That's the priority. That's what these people are thinking about. You think they have time to be thinking about any, any kind of Nice ideas for protecting people any more than than Lincoln did. What he's referring to, there is a moment in 1861 when Abraham Lincoln basically tossed this alleged confederate in jail without due process and then justified it by saying he had to save the Union and that case Supreme Court justice, Roger Tani ruled against him, should legal said, oh well Tani he's the chief justice. And he said this jerk should be released. I guess I have to do that. Here's the chief justice. No, you do that enough times as the president you're out.

Speaker 18:         34:00          It seems to me that that's why we have courts. We have, oh, come on. What's the restrain the executives use?

Speaker 17:         34:07          Why do we have, we do not have courts so that presidents can be checked in situations of a national emergency. That was my courts were set up.

Speaker 18:         34:23          So that then what I mean, I guess I'm, I'm flailing now, but then what stops them? What if, cause if Congress can't stop them and if the courts can't stop them, like what can stop a president in a time of war?

Speaker 17:         34:38          There's nobody. There's nobody can check that. That's the presidents responsibility.

Speaker 3:          34:49          [inaudible]

Speaker 18:         34:50          obviously I like a do over because somehow in the heat of the moment, I forgot that I'm talking about defending the rights of actual American citizens. And Posner is talking about people who are rebels to the country. Um, there's probably a way where I could have said pointed that out to him. Um, in terms of the court stepping in, I mean, it happens, it happened to Truman. But you know, judge Posner is right that it doesn't happen a lot, which is why he gets to be judge Posner. And I'm the guy that had to check Wikipedia.

Speaker 17:         35:25          And by the way, do you think these supreme court justices are great big brains, big stars who were selected because of the best lawyers in the United States and their decisions

Speaker 1:          35:38          are, are usually great. You think all of that? I don't, I don't have a high respect for the Supreme Court at all. Um, I'm, I mean, you look at their decisions

Speaker 10:         35:52          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          35:52          you look at them how they're pointed, who appoints them,

Speaker 19:         35:58          right. This is, so why do you think the supreme court has such a great balance to the president in a war?

Speaker 10:         36:11          [inaudible]

Speaker 19:         36:11          but this is what gets me up and gets me going because I still think it can be used as a precedent. So you're, you're, you're, you're, you're still worried that it can be used. Yes. And that, do you think it will be like, do you felt like, you know, I think we cannot take this for granted.

Speaker 10:         36:33          [inaudible]

Speaker 20:         36:34          coming up since Fred Korematsu couldn't get justice inside Supreme Court question is,

Speaker 1:          36:43          can you find it on the outside more? Perfect. We'll continue in a second.

Speaker 21:         37:05          I'm Preet Bharara every weekend. My podcast, stay tuned. I answer your questions about what's really happening in Washington. I wonder if it is legal for president Trump to initiate military action against North Korea. What happens if Mueller returns? I'm indictment again, the president. I just want to know, are you a table genius? Subscribe to stay tuned from cafe and W NYC studios.

Speaker 1:          37:39          This is more perfect. I'm Chad. I'm rod here with Julia Longoria. All right, so getting back to the story of Fred, uh, picking up from the decision. What happened after that? So the interment camp where Fred was staying closed in 1945, um, and Fred had gotten permission by that point to work at a steel mill in Detroit. So he was living in Detroit. He fell in love with a woman named Catherine. They got married, moved back to the bay area and had two kids. And Karen, his daughter says that they were kind of ostracized from the Japanese American community. They grew up outside of the Japanese community. He was involved in boy scouts, girl scouts. So I was at girl scouts. So you know, the camps, when we had to open the camp, it would work on that. Uh, the Presbyterian church in Oakland and then he became an elder.

Speaker 1:          38:27          So even joined the lion's club and he was president twice. And Karen says throughout the forties, the 50s, the 60s, she never heard him talk about his case. No, never. No, never. He just, he never, he never, he never told a story even after she confronted him about it in high school. Yeah, it's, that's it. But she says in like 1969 ish, 68 or 69 when the world was in a very different place. They got a phone call back in those days, you know, you, my parent's phone number was in the phone book of all things. Cause I mean my father would get phone calls from law students want to interview him, but he really didn't want to talk about his case much. He just, it was just too painful. But this time there was a professor on the line from the University of California, Berkeley. He was a Japanese guy actually, and he told Fred, I really, really want you to come into my class.

Speaker 1:          39:23          There was a ethnic studies class that was actually off campus. Ethnic studies was not even recognized then. So he, he talked at this ethnic studies class and these kids were brutal. I mean UC Berkeley at that time had this, you know, notorious reputation of being very radical. People were asking questions during the whole hour. This is Jean Kwan, former mayor of Oakland. She was in the class that day. It was a important time that you, at different times of your life you had to learn to stand up to authority. And certainly these students who are like, you know, fist pounding saying, well, why didn't you, why didn't you protest? Why didn't you do this? Why didn't you do that? Why didn't you fight harder? And we're almost, you know, angry that he wasn't angry. You know, I think you've got to remember that a lot of these students even know anything about the camps. Many, many kids had not had frank discussions with their own parents. So of course Matsui was probably a surrogate for like their parents. How could they have gone through that and never told me they had no right not to tell me and so they're really angry at their parents surrogate or not. Fred felt like he was being indicted all over again. It was such a painful experience for my father. He never wanted to speak to anyone again.

Speaker 1:          40:49          Fred would ultimately challenge his conviction in a lower court and he would win the Supreme Court decision still stands, but he was able to clear his own personal name

Speaker 3:          41:04          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          41:04          and in around 1990 again the world in a very different place. He finds himself again on a college campus. This time the University of of Michigan, my father and mother were walking with some other students across the campus to see the newly renovated library and you know, my father loved architecture. It was very old gothic a library. So they're walking through this sort of open quad looking the architecture and then they come upon this group of students, a group of Arab American students. The students start walking toward him. They all of a sudden kind of surrounded my father and they had this certificate, um, to give to my father, to thank him for speaking up. So that was meaningful to him. Why, why did that make you emotional? Why that story

Speaker 3:          42:06          [inaudible]

Speaker 19:         42:07          Oh, uh, well because it, it meant so much to my father that this group really honored him that also had been racially profiled, you know, to think that he would be able to touch their lives. It kind of reinforced what he was doing.

Speaker 3:          42:39          [inaudible]

Speaker 19:         42:39          do you have the same faith in the Constitution that your dad did that? Yes, I have great faith in our constitution. It's a great document. It is so happens though that it's the way that certain people interpret it that gets us into trouble. Yes, definitely. Okay.

Speaker 3:          43:33          [inaudible] Julie Envoy [inaudible] this from our legal editor, Allianz [inaudible]. The danger is the law, the need for my travel ban 3.0 coming here tonight. The top administration unveiling new travel restrictions on certain foreign nationals from eight countries where they're gonna go, because they sold everything with the feeling where they're thinking they're going to start a new life in United States. [inaudible] this is the one we won. We won the freedom we want to deliver to people. We are the people, we the people. But there are many, many lawyers here. They're all working pro bono. They're from different organizations is what resistance looks like. This sends a message that they cannot do away with constitutional protections without people standing up for the constitution. So I think this is inspirational. I think it's wonderful, and I think we need to be vigilant and keep fighting.
