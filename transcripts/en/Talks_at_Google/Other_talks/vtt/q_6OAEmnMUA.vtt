[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.423 --> 00:00:07.452
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:07.452 --> 00:00:09.160
MALE SPEAKER: So we'll
get right into it.

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.975
Bob spent decades at Walt Disney
Imagineering back in the day

00:00:12.975 --> 00:00:16.340
when it was WED.

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.455
So we're going to go through his
time there, working with Walt,

00:00:19.455 --> 00:00:21.830
building Disneyland, and some
of the most infamous rides.

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:23.930
So we'll get right into it, Bob.

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.020
BOB GURR: Infamous?

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:27.380
No, they were classic.

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.910
[LAUGH]

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.600
MALE SPEAKER: So
they were classy.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.790
Classy rides.

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.330
And so we'll get right into it.

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:38.970
So Bob, you went to
school at the Art Center

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:40.760
College of Design in LA.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.010
And you ended up going to
General Motors and to Ford.

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.280
And so what kind of
got you into Disney?

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.740
BOB GURR: General Motors
scholarship, hired by Ford.

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.080
Speak about burning bridges.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.000
[LAUGH]

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.586
MALE SPEAKER: So what was
the transition from there

00:00:55.586 --> 00:00:57.086
into-- so how did
Walt find you, how

00:00:57.086 --> 00:00:58.594
did you get into Imagineering?

00:00:58.594 --> 00:00:59.510
BOB GURR: Very simple.

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.280
I was at the Art Center
College, the one over there.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.090
And there was a guy who was a
job placement officer who had

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:05.990
placed me at Ford years ago.

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.190
Happened to ask, do
you do outside work?

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:09.860
I didn't, but I said yes.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.480
That's the first clue
you want to do in life.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.310
Next day-- that was only the
22nd meeting, by the way.

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:16.440
Next day, I got a call.

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.880
Go to the Disney studio
and meet Mr. Irvine there

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.760
in about 20 minutes.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.920
Boy, I had seen an article
in the "Los Angeles Times"

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.300
some weeks before of a
thing called Disney Land.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.390
And I thought, wow.

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.120
That would be a fabulous
place to go some day.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.360
Then I was also friends
with Ub Iwerks, who

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.950
was the man who started
the company with Walt.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.684
And he shows movies of what's
going on in the back lot.

00:01:39.684 --> 00:01:41.350
And there was a little
chassis of a car.

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:42.290
No body.

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.150
And I thought, you
don't suppose they

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.930
need a body on a little car,
and I'm a body designer?

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:47.910
That was a good guess.

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.940
And I went to work, and 27
years later when they fired me,

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:52.160
I got all those jobs done.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.465
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:54.465 --> 00:01:56.420
Yeah, that's 45 seconds of life.

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.710
MALE SPEAKER: There we go.

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:57.335
And we're done.

00:01:57.335 --> 00:01:57.930
There we go.

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:58.566
[LAUGH]

00:01:58.566 --> 00:01:59.440
So that's incredible.

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.480
So when you heard about
that Disneyland was coming

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:02.850
and you were getting
involved, did it just

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:03.870
seem like a crazy idea?

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.129
Because it really
hadn't been done before.

00:02:06.129 --> 00:02:06.670
BOB GURR: No.

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:12.540
You've got to realize, there was
no such thing as Theme Park 101

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.932
in college.

00:02:13.932 --> 00:02:15.640
Everything that
everybody was going to do

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.680
had never been done before.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.850
So it didn't matter what
you were educated at,

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.070
you weren't going to use
your education anyway.

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.460
Walt was always
going to give out

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.130
requests to do this and do
this and figure things out.

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.254
And he'd never done it
either, of course, you know.

00:02:29.254 --> 00:02:31.050
But he had done
animation in films.

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.060
But now he wanted to do
a brick and mortar park,

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.440
and it was quite radical.

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.000
So basically, he figured
out what kind of people

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.640
might be able to do the
things he wanted done.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.444
And he was very typical, when
he would ask you to do something

00:02:43.444 --> 00:02:45.610
and it was something you'd
never done before-- like,

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.132
we had animators who
had never sculpted,

00:02:48.132 --> 00:02:50.590
and then Walt said, well, I
think you'd be a good sculptor.

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.830
Why don't you just start?

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.400
That's how he
would treat people.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.250
And of course in my case, since
I was trained in body design,

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.340
just let's say the surface
development part of a car,

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.960
Walt assumed that if
I did auto styling,

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.620
I did mechanical engineering.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.710
[LAUGH]

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:12.650
I just shut up and
just kept working.

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.320
And it turned out, I have no
mechanical engineering training

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.730
whatsoever, but I got the best
mechanical engineering training

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.276
by actually doing the job
that I wasn't qualified for.

00:03:24.276 --> 00:03:25.400
Now stop and think of that.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.250
[LAUGH]

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.870
No, really.

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.676
If you were to go to a
school, you have a curriculum,

00:03:29.676 --> 00:03:31.300
you come out of it--
four years, you'll

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.610
come out the other end like
your trained in a deep trough,

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:36.220
and you can't get
out, but you know

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.720
how to do what they
taught you to do.

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.650
Your mind-- there's
no more flexibility.

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.230
But under Walt Disney and with
people that he would gather,

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.560
people were free to
think in all directions

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.940
in any combination, any time,
to try to figure stuff out.

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.030
That seemed to be the giant
clue around Walt Disney

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.337
that you just don't
see in a lot of people.

00:03:56.337 --> 00:03:57.170
MALE SPEAKER: Right.

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:58.870
And so what was it like
to work with him when

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.036
you first initially met him?

00:04:00.036 --> 00:04:03.140
Because obviously, he was really
famous, really well known.

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:06.410
So what kind of man was
he like to work with?

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:10.950
BOB GURR: On one hand,
he was very serious.

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.350
And on the other hand, when he
was excited about something,

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.420
that little eyebrow
would just shoot up.

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:19.050
And he had that little
twinkle in his eye like,

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:21.209
oh, I'm going to have
something nobody's got.

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.000
Wait till I show the
world this thing.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.460
So kind of a pixie-like thing.

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.560
But day in, day out
I would say he's kind

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.240
of slightly serious, slightly
agitated a little bit.

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.060
And I think the
source of that was,

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.393
like, you run across a lot
of people that are like that,

00:04:36.393 --> 00:04:40.210
they are thinking the whole time
of what they're going to do.

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:45.620
And it's such a consuming thing,
almost like 24 hours a day.

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.501
I think at night, some of
us-- we think all night long

00:04:48.501 --> 00:04:50.000
and we wake up and
go, oh, I got it.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.420
I got it.

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:51.461
Write it down real quick.

00:04:51.461 --> 00:04:54.420
Then I got to go to work in the
morning and hope I remember it.

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:56.200
His mind worked like that.

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.470
And a lot of people-- he
collected work just like that.

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:02.770
It wasn't an eight
hour type of day.

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:04.990
Walt also had another
characteristic

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:08.210
that was kind of fascinating
and very natural,

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:11.770
and I've seen other executives
in later years do this.

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:14.180
Instead of having a
classical management

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:17.099
matrix where you have an officer
at the top of the company,

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:19.390
you have workers down at the
lower part of the company,

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:21.510
the information goes down,
information turns around,

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:24.093
comes back, and it goes through
filters going both directions,

00:05:24.093 --> 00:05:25.990
so you don't get
the true answer.

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:28.340
Walt would walk
out of his office

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:31.480
and walk around that whole
back lot at the studio,

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:34.060
see what's going on
with his own eyes.

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:35.070
Stop and think.

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:38.040
You won't be more than about
three days out of whack

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:41.680
before he'll notice you need
to do something a little bit

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:42.640
different.

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:47.420
The time saving is fabulous,
but here's the other thing.

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:49.290
Let's say you're
working on something

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:51.310
and you thought you
understood what you wanted,

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:54.440
and then he sees it, and
it's not what he wanted.

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.260
How many times you run
across a manager who says,

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.760
you do that dumb thing one more
time, I'm going to fire you.

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.002
I warned you.

00:06:01.002 --> 00:06:01.710
Well, guess what?

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:06.160
You are not going to contribute
another idea to that guy.

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.425
You guys are different
up here, aren't you?

00:06:08.425 --> 00:06:10.050
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah,
we don't get fired.

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:11.310
BOB GURR: Yeah, right.

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:13.146
MALE SPEAKER: We just
get moved around.

00:06:13.146 --> 00:06:14.020
BOB GURR: Yeah, yeah.

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:15.900
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:18.240
Yeah, I notice you can
move people pretty far

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:19.865
away from where I used to live.

00:06:19.865 --> 00:06:21.170
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:21.770
Yeah, yeah.

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:23.980
Yeah Yeah, they still get
the bicycle [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:25.309
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:25.309 --> 00:06:26.640
Oh, yeah.

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:31.360
But the way he would do it
is, let's say you're not

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.550
doing quite as expected.

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:35.220
He wouldn't chew you out.

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:39.050
He'd actually look at something
and he'd say, say, Bobby.

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:43.700
Did you ever think of-- oh, I
didn't think of that one, Walt.

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:46.460
Now you are-- you
can't wait to share

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:49.150
your new idea of his
new idea that just

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:51.050
happened 20 seconds before.

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:53.970
Now you've got this
rapport that's going on,

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:55.770
and you have a free exchange.

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:56.490
You understand?

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:58.600
That's how that kind
of a loop works.

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:01.780
That to him was natural, and
people that would work there,

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:04.360
it didn't take very
long before that

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:06.877
was their natural, daily MO.

00:07:06.877 --> 00:07:08.960
Now I've also got to
remember, to a lot of people,

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:11.110
let's say even as
late as one 1954

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:14.790
when I started with the
company, a guy like Walt

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:16.320
would seem like a god.

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:19.770
In other words, I'm a
seriously-- a really famous,

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:21.610
famous person.

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:24.160
I would see times there'd be
executives at other companies.

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.570
They'd get too close to Walt and
their lower lip would quiver.

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:28.320
They didn't quite know how
to talk because they're

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:29.611
in the presence of Walt Disney.

00:07:29.611 --> 00:07:31.250
The god, you know?

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:36.030
Walt did everything possible
to make himself approachable.

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:38.772
He'd unloosen his tie and make
himself look kind of ratty

00:07:38.772 --> 00:07:40.230
so as he could have
a conversation.

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:41.680
And he would always
point out to people,

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:43.780
he says, well, you know,
to get this stuff done,

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:45.730
I have to talk to
people, you know?

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:49.490
And so the rhythm in
the company always

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:51.444
developed all over a while.

00:07:51.444 --> 00:07:52.860
Took a couple of
weeks to get used

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:54.460
to the fact that, oh, my God.

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:58.250
Here comes Walt. Now it's a
case of, hiya, Walt. It's just

00:07:58.250 --> 00:07:59.000
as simple as that.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.020
Because now you have to have--
everybody's on that same level.

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:06.410
Now you can have a critique,
and the design is good

00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:09.350
or the design is bad,
or needs some work.

00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:11.850
Now if the design was good,
what you're doing is good,

00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:12.984
Walt would simply walk in.

00:08:12.984 --> 00:08:13.900
He'd just look around.

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:15.090
Sometimes he
wouldn't say a word.

00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:16.006
He'd just walk around.

00:08:16.006 --> 00:08:19.360
He'd look at your drafting
board or maybe say something,

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:21.530
and he'd walk out.

00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:24.020
About five minutes later,
the guy down the hall

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:26.589
would come and run into the
room and says, what is it

00:08:26.589 --> 00:08:27.130
you're doing?

00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:28.720
Walt just came in
and said, you gotta

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:31.330
go see what Gurr's
doing down there.

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:32.789
That's your attaboy.

00:08:32.789 --> 00:08:35.705
Now see, he never gave a
personal attaboy to anybody.

00:08:35.705 --> 00:08:37.330
You just don't do that.

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:39.100
But he couldn't wait
to go tell somebody

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:41.120
else how good your stuff was.

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:45.780
So this was a very strange
kind of way to do that.

00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:49.090
He had another characteristic
when he was coming down

00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:50.690
the hallway to go to your room.

00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:52.040
You see that little cough?

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:54.060
He had a little double cough.

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:57.940
And this was like you had
the 10 second warning.

00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:00.050
You know, clean up your
act real quick there.

00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:01.250
Your door's always open.

00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:03.580
You never leave a
closed door there,

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:05.940
because he will show up at
any time without warning

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:07.149
and in any building.

00:09:07.149 --> 00:09:08.190
In particular, the shops.

00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:11.210
He loved to run around in
the shops all the time.

00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:13.460
So that's the general
set and setting.

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:15.530
That's a long way to
answer, what was Walt

00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:17.240
like to work with?

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:19.690
A lot of people today
will say, well, no.

00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:20.804
That was 50 years ago.

00:09:20.804 --> 00:09:21.970
People don't work like that.

00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:26.310
Well, some years ago when
I had my own company later,

00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:27.595
I worked for Steven Spielberg.

00:09:27.595 --> 00:09:30.790
And he was running, like, $200
million worth of film product,

00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:32.830
and he had, like, 46 employees.

00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:36.270
He had a cute little set of
buildings out in Universal next

00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:37.350
to a river.

00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:38.710
He did exactly the same thing.

00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:40.210
He talked the people
doing the work,

00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:42.290
and he didn't have any
layers of management.

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:45.150
Another guy, Steve
Wynn in Las Vegas.

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:48.150
You know, he was like
the mogul of Las Vegas.

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:51.492
He talked directly to
people, and he wouldn't even

00:09:51.492 --> 00:09:52.950
go through a
secretary if he wanted

00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:55.160
to phone-- if he had a question,
he'd just phone you up.

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.451
And remember, that's the guy
that's running the Mirage.

00:09:57.451 --> 00:09:59.780
He was running
later the Bellagio,

00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:01.930
and now he's got two
more Wynn hotels.

00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:07.290
Spielberg and Wynn
and Walt, they're

00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:11.100
very similar kind of
guys to work with.

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:15.280
They understood this thing,
that tight communication,

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:19.940
not being driven by
methodologies or procedures

00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:21.150
or protocols.

00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:22.780
That's the big lesson.

00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:24.750
Now when I walk around
this place here,

00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:26.660
I'm still just like
going, I'm in Google.

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:27.322
I'm in Google.

00:10:27.322 --> 00:10:29.030
You know, it's like
everything I see here

00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:32.080
is like, I was born
60 years too late.

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:33.530
Now I can't be here, you, know?

00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:34.510
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:36.260
MALE SPEAKER: But you built
Disneyland, I'm pretty sure.

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:37.140
BOB GURR: Yeah, I
built Disneyland.

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:37.710
OK.

00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:38.626
MALE SPEAKER: You win.

00:10:38.626 --> 00:10:40.890
BOB GURR: No, but
this is-- this is

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:44.420
so much like the early days
of what was then called

00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:47.400
WED Enterprise,
Walter Elias Disney.

00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:49.390
It's almost eerie.

00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:51.890
And I look around and I
see bright looking faces,

00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:55.010
and it's like, it's is a
starting IQ of 180 here.

00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:56.490
What is it?

00:10:56.490 --> 00:10:57.849
MALE SPEAKER: That's not mine.

00:10:57.849 --> 00:10:58.962
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:58.962 --> 00:10:59.670
I don't know why.

00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:02.940
BOB GURR: No, but there's--
when you go to places,

00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:06.670
you can see the enthusiasm
on people's faces.

00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:09.680
I was-- two weeks
ago I was at SpaceX.

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:11.770
I got to see them build
rockets down there.

00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:14.030
I met Elon Musk.

00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:17.480
I'm being chauffeured today on
a Tesla S. I think it's a D85.

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:19.300
Is that a D85?

00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:20.462
Ooh.

00:11:20.462 --> 00:11:22.920
He's going to give me the full
pedal this weekend, I think.

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:24.450
[LAUGH]

00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:28.970
No, but there are companies
that remind me so much

00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:32.740
of Walt's time a long time ago.

00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:35.770
And if you understand what
that spark is up here-- I'm

00:11:35.770 --> 00:11:38.450
guessing you have some
management that, you know,

00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:38.950
what?

00:11:38.950 --> 00:11:42.720
17 years, started with a
couple of geeks, and look.

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:44.710
You've got 17,000
geeks up here now.

00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:46.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:48.510
And it looks like
you're having fun,

00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:50.270
but you're productive
at the same time.

00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:53.410
Well, that's the way we used
to do it so long ago to get

00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:55.050
Disneyland built that fast.

00:11:55.050 --> 00:11:55.599
OK.

00:11:55.599 --> 00:11:56.640
You got another question?

00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:57.675
MALE SPEAKER: I got a few more.

00:11:57.675 --> 00:11:58.420
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:58.420 --> 00:11:58.920
Yeah.

00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:00.390
No, I mean, you've
really-- I mean,

00:12:00.390 --> 00:12:02.130
you've designed some of
the most incredible rides.

00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:02.910
I mean, you did Autopia.

00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:04.368
That was your first
project, right?

00:12:04.368 --> 00:12:05.530
BOB GURR: Autopia car, yes.

00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:05.770
MALE SPEAKER: Right.

00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:07.810
And so what was kind of that
process in designing that?

00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:08.970
Was that just
simply, well, you're

00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:10.170
just going to design cars?

00:12:10.170 --> 00:12:11.170
Like, what was the idea?

00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:14.600
How big to make them, and how--
you know, how to make them run?

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:16.610
BOB GURR: Did you just
hear what you just said?

00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:17.100
MALE SPEAKER: I don't know.

00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:17.880
BOB GURR: Process.

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:19.377
MALE SPEAKER: Process.

00:12:19.377 --> 00:12:21.210
BOB GURR: (ACCENTED)
We don't use processes.

00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:22.540
[LAUGH]

00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:23.319
We just do it.

00:12:23.319 --> 00:12:24.360
MALE SPEAKER: Just do it.

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:25.640
BOB GURR: Yeah.

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:26.490
That's a bad word.

00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:27.810
Everybody has to be processed.

00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:28.830
Then I stare at people.

00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:29.930
I say, process.

00:12:29.930 --> 00:12:30.500
[LAUGH]

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:31.450
That's the bad word.

00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:33.450
That's like being in a rut.

00:12:33.450 --> 00:12:36.900
Smart people, given a
question and you've never

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:40.090
done it before, you don't
get there with a process.

00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:43.860
You get there by clear
thinking, off the wall thinking.

00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:47.230
You know, French cats bouncing
off a wall type of thinking.

00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:50.650
And you do that with everybody
around you, and guess what?

00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:52.210
The configuration's
going to work.

00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:54.390
Gradually becomes
very, very visible.

00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:56.790
And it's never
done by a process.

00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:59.270
Ordinary companies
are process companies.

00:12:59.270 --> 00:13:01.522
So don't use that
word on me again.

00:13:01.522 --> 00:13:02.230
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:02.620
BOB GURR: All right.

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:03.244
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:03.244 --> 00:13:04.410
MALE SPEAKER: So no process.

00:13:04.410 --> 00:13:07.912
So there was no process involved
with creating the animatronics.

00:13:07.912 --> 00:13:09.370
But you did get
involved with that,

00:13:09.370 --> 00:13:10.578
so I want to talk about that.

00:13:10.578 --> 00:13:12.240
Because that's some
incredible work

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:14.360
that you've done, with
Disney and with Universal.

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:16.526
BOB GURR: Well, the audio
animatronics-- remember, I

00:13:16.526 --> 00:13:18.850
was known as a car guy
because I fiddled around

00:13:18.850 --> 00:13:19.900
with cars in high school.

00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:22.370
I rebuilt my own engines
and stuff like that.

00:13:22.370 --> 00:13:26.540
So I had a working
knowledge of cars, anyway.

00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:28.330
And after a number
of years, we were

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:30.360
doing work for the
New York World's Fair

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:32.700
in which I was in charge
of designing the Ford Magic

00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:36.350
Skyway, which is a great big
assembly line of cars being

00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:39.250
moved by wheels with passengers,
using regular passenger cars.

00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:42.930
It was about a three year
job to engineer that thing.

00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:45.940
And I was working on two
of the other attractions.

00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:50.160
And at the last minute, about
for five months before the park

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:53.440
was-- or the show, the fair
was going to open, Walt says,

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:56.066
Bobby, I want you to
design Abraham Lincoln,

00:13:56.066 --> 00:13:56.690
the body of it.

00:13:56.690 --> 00:13:57.390
We've got one here.

00:13:57.390 --> 00:13:58.890
We've been working
on it for a year.

00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:00.560
Doesn't work.

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:03.530
The head works, the hands
work, but the body won't work.

00:14:03.530 --> 00:14:05.030
And I thought, I
don't know anything

00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:06.165
about human physiology.

00:14:06.165 --> 00:14:07.590
[LAUGH]

00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:10.650
And Lincoln doesn't have
any wheels, you know?

00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:11.920
But guess what?

00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:16.520
In maybe a minute I looked
at that Lincoln that was not

00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:19.530
working, and I saw it
as an aircraft fuselage

00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:23.470
made out of thin
walled steel tube

00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:26.810
with little pneumatic
cylinders, a few hydraulics

00:14:26.810 --> 00:14:29.450
cylinders, little Fafnir
aircraft bearings.

00:14:29.450 --> 00:14:31.990
I did not see it as a
human, and I did not

00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:33.430
see it in the way
the machine had

00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:36.450
been evolved in a design
in the machine shop.

00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:38.900
That's an example when I'm
talking about free thinking

00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:41.290
that had I not been
a free thinker,

00:14:41.290 --> 00:14:43.440
I would have not
had the direction

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:46.490
to go within about two
minutes from the time Walt

00:14:46.490 --> 00:14:47.480
asked me to do that.

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:48.660
I was in a glider club.

00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:53.150
I just happened to have
a steel tube fuselage

00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:54.810
aircraft that was restoring.

00:14:54.810 --> 00:14:57.060
And I immediately saw,
that's the way to do it.

00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:59.393
How many people have ever
been to the Walt Disney Family

00:14:59.393 --> 00:15:00.860
Museum up here?

00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:01.430
Well, OK.

00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:04.290
Did you see downstairs,
there's an exhibit

00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:06.770
with Abraham Lincoln?

00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:08.410
Nobody remembers seeing that.

00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:08.940
Oh, you did.

00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:10.070
OK.

00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:13.740
In that little window,
there's a steel tube frame.

00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:16.710
That's the original upper
body of Abraham Lincoln.

00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:20.760
Was the first one to be shown
at the New York World's Fair.

00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:24.330
That was the high
point of Walt's pride

00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:27.800
in doing auto animatronics, and
he asked a car guy to do it.

00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:29.530
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:29.530 --> 00:15:31.740
Now see, the education
still wouldn't have helped.

00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:32.800
Yeah.

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:35.100
Because we were
all free thinkers.

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:36.970
Anyway, I owned that thing.

00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:38.910
I loaned it to him
up there, so it's

00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:40.579
kind of like a permanent loan.

00:15:40.579 --> 00:15:42.370
So if you haven't been
there, if you really

00:15:42.370 --> 00:15:45.890
want to see a simple way
to do an animated figure,

00:15:45.890 --> 00:15:48.485
50 years ago that's what we did.

00:15:48.485 --> 00:15:49.860
MALE SPEAKER: So
you've obviously

00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:51.862
been to the parks
since then obviously,

00:15:51.862 --> 00:15:52.820
since you worked there.

00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:56.190
So what impresses you now
about how animatronics

00:15:56.190 --> 00:15:58.250
work now and the parks,
and some of lands

00:15:58.250 --> 00:16:00.544
and stuff they're doing?

00:16:00.544 --> 00:16:02.710
BOB GURR: The evolution of
audio animatronics, which

00:16:02.710 --> 00:16:05.420
is a trade name that
Disney company uses,

00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:10.430
has been constant
evolution all the time.

00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:13.260
We were sort of the
leading edge of doing

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:17.430
the first types of rob-- what
we would call robotic animation.

00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:23.030
We were using some of the latest
systems for serviles, controls,

00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:27.380
feedback methodologies that
were used in the space program

00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:30.730
for going to the moon.

00:16:30.730 --> 00:16:35.930
So there was parts and systems
and components coming online

00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:38.270
basically for NASA
at that time, and we

00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:40.010
had access to all that stuff.

00:16:40.010 --> 00:16:44.210
Walt was always very aware
of the latest tools, a way

00:16:44.210 --> 00:16:45.630
to tell stories.

00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:47.350
So this was a very
natural progression.

00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:48.510
It went very, very fast.

00:16:48.510 --> 00:16:51.740
And by I would say
in 1972 or 1973,

00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:54.780
we developed our own system
called DACS, Digital Animation

00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:55.539
Control System.

00:16:55.539 --> 00:16:57.080
So we were doing a
lot of development

00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:59.270
in-house, leading edge stuff.

00:16:59.270 --> 00:17:02.540
But as time went on, the rest
of the world kind of caught up.

00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:04.319
Everybody can do this now.

00:17:04.319 --> 00:17:07.470
And actually, the way we
do it now, we actually

00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:10.680
have a company called
Garner Holt Productions out

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:13.579
in San Bernardino, California.

00:17:13.579 --> 00:17:17.319
Disney lets them do all of
the developmental work for all

00:17:17.319 --> 00:17:20.589
of our theme parks
worldwide, because they're

00:17:20.589 --> 00:17:23.740
more like a production house,
and we have the systems

00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:25.040
that are all available.

00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:28.410
A lot of the show control
systems are standard,

00:17:28.410 --> 00:17:31.540
let's say, black boxes you
can buy from anybody now.

00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:34.750
So we're very standardized
in that respect.

00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:37.250
We really don't have to
invent serious stuff anymore

00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:39.250
because there's such
an array of stuff

00:17:39.250 --> 00:17:41.380
that you can use nowadays.

00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:42.116
So yes.

00:17:42.116 --> 00:17:44.240
There is that kind of a
transition, the development

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:45.520
of audio animatronics.

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:47.229
So it's much more
productionized now.

00:17:47.229 --> 00:17:48.020
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:51.110
So can you talk about the
design of the monorail, which

00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:52.400
is just a huge feature?

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:55.774
And it's still around Disneyland
and Disney World today.

00:17:55.774 --> 00:17:58.274
BOB GURR: How many of you ever
rode the Disneyland monorail?

00:17:58.274 --> 00:17:59.930
Oh, all hands come up.

00:17:59.930 --> 00:18:00.970
Thank you very much.

00:18:00.970 --> 00:18:01.940
I appreciate that.

00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:03.420
Yeah.

00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:06.250
I had never seen that
configuration of a monorail.

00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:07.710
And going back
the way Walt would

00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:12.720
ask somebody do something,
he walks in in October 1958.

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:15.050
Walks in, shows me these
pictures of a really ugly

00:18:15.050 --> 00:18:18.060
looking train sitting on a--
looked like a loaf of bread

00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:20.260
with a slot in the bottom
sitting on a stick.

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:23.710
And he says, Bobby, we're going
to build a monorail system

00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:26.866
in Disneyland, and I want you
to get started right away on it.

00:18:26.866 --> 00:18:27.990
And walked out of the room.

00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:30.630
He left me these pictures
of this ugly thing.

00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:32.470
And I had never seen
that configuration.

00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:35.750
I thought they always hung, you
know, from an overhead beam.

00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:37.780
And again, there you are.

00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:42.140
We're sitting area like,
that wasn't even a meeting.

00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:43.380
Well, I start.

00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:44.760
I'm going to start.

00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:46.260
And guess what?

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:48.700
If you are a curious
person and you've

00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:51.100
spent all your time
snooping into everything

00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:53.925
you can snoop into and
putting it on your head,

00:18:53.925 --> 00:18:55.300
and you may never
use it, but you

00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:56.800
might use it someday--
and remember,

00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:59.750
I'm going back to auto shop,
car kid, all that kind of stuff.

00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:02.300
Hanging around with race cars.

00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:07.120
I had a broad brush idea
of how stuff sort of works.

00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:11.430
A monorail is nothing more
than a strange looking bus.

00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:13.336
The wheels are simply in line.

00:19:13.336 --> 00:19:15.210
They sit on top of the
road, and then there's

00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:16.880
wheels running on the side.

00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:18.920
But they've still got
seats, doors, and windows,

00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:20.410
and people sitting in it.

00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:20.910
OK.

00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:22.010
It's like a streetcar.

00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:24.000
Oh, well, you can buy
that stuff, you know.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.460
It's a 600 volt power systems.

00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:32.360
You put 450 volt motors
together of a suspension system.

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:34.569
I knew how these
gravel trucks worked.

00:19:34.569 --> 00:19:36.110
At that time there
was a thing called

00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:40.140
a Smithway, which was kind of an
all-in-one unitized suspension.

00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:43.140
And within two weeks,
I had enough drawings

00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:45.650
that I made that my boss
and I were sent over

00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:47.640
to Germany to talk to
the Allway company, who

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:49.310
we were going to work with.

00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:53.120
And I had enough of the design
that we could discuss it

00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:54.504
in a lot of detail.

00:19:54.504 --> 00:19:56.420
And then the Germans
knew that they were going

00:19:56.420 --> 00:19:58.870
to sell their design to us.

00:19:58.870 --> 00:20:01.050
And Walt said, no.

00:20:01.050 --> 00:20:03.842
We're going to use your idea,
but it's going to be my train,

00:20:03.842 --> 00:20:05.300
and we're going to
do it ourselves.

00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:06.820
And then at the
end of the week it

00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:11.330
was, Mr. Gurr is not a
licensed diploma engineer.

00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:12.440
He cannot do this.

00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:13.260
[LAUGH]

00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:15.240
You're a movie studio.

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:17.150
Well, yeah.

00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:18.338
But I'm doing it.

00:20:18.338 --> 00:20:20.090
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:20.720
True story.

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:22.384
And that's how
fast we would work.

00:20:22.384 --> 00:20:24.300
Now remember, that was
eight and a half months

00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:26.260
from the time Walt
gave me the picture.

00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:27.510
And we jumped on the thing.

00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:30.410
And I had about five
drafters helping me.

00:20:30.410 --> 00:20:32.200
And we figured the
whole darn thing out.

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:34.170
And we had a shop
starting to build it

00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:36.940
and a commercial
company that built

00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:39.717
garbage trucks that was closed.

00:20:39.717 --> 00:20:41.800
Halfway through the job,
they were going too slow.

00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:44.290
So we just picked the job
up, put it in the studio.

00:20:44.290 --> 00:20:46.770
We had a big sound stage,
which was a factory.

00:20:46.770 --> 00:20:49.270
So my boss said,
keep drawing it up,

00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:52.441
but now you supervise
the construction.

00:20:52.441 --> 00:20:53.440
Eight and a half months.

00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:54.400
The whole darn thing.

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:56.670
And opening day, I
gave Richard Nixon,

00:20:56.670 --> 00:21:00.090
the vice president of the
United States, a ride on it.

00:21:00.090 --> 00:21:03.690
No estimating, no budgeting,
nobody interfering,

00:21:03.690 --> 00:21:06.270
no project manager,
no coordinators.

00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:09.370
Everybody doing the work talked
to everybody all day long.

00:21:09.370 --> 00:21:12.960
Everybody from the shop level
to people doing the concrete

00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:14.160
designs.

00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:17.360
That's how fast you
can go if you're

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:19.300
a completely free
thinker and you've

00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:21.770
been given something
you know nothing about.

00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:25.490
And everybody was
just like that.

00:21:25.490 --> 00:21:27.655
MALE SPEAKER: That's incredible.

00:21:27.655 --> 00:21:29.960
What was your favorite
project to work on?

00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:31.630
BOB GURR: Oh, the
little fire engine.

00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:35.230
Anybody been down to Disney
and ride the fire engine?

00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:37.198
That's my fire engine.

00:21:37.198 --> 00:21:38.990
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:38.990 --> 00:21:40.450
I always wanted a fire engine.

00:21:40.450 --> 00:21:42.800
Ward Kimball was one
of Walt's animators.

00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:45.490
He had a fire engine in
1916, American LaFrance,

00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:47.990
and I got to drive it
in the parade once.

00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:49.330
I always wanted a fire engine.

00:21:49.330 --> 00:21:51.875
One day Walt was in my office
and I said, Walt, you know,

00:21:51.875 --> 00:21:54.955
we don't have a fire
engine on Main Street.

00:21:54.955 --> 00:21:56.022
No, Bobby, we don't.

00:21:56.022 --> 00:21:58.230
And about 10 minutes later,
the accounting department

00:21:58.230 --> 00:22:01.440
phones up, says, the accounting
project number for the new fire

00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:03.360
engine project is--
and I thought, yes!

00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:03.860
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:07.100
You know, I finally
have a fire engine.

00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:09.170
We built it at a
studio in Burbank.

00:22:09.170 --> 00:22:11.310
And I got a DMV
moving permit, and I

00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:14.670
drove that thing down the Santa
Ana Freeway-- two cylinder car.

00:22:14.670 --> 00:22:16.870
Drove it all the way
to Disney, because that

00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:18.501
was my fire engine.

00:22:18.501 --> 00:22:19.000
Yeah.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:20.000
You asked me a question.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.630
What's my best attraction?

00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:22.681
That's it.

00:22:22.681 --> 00:22:23.180
Yeah.

00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:24.612
[LAUGH]

00:22:24.612 --> 00:22:26.570
MALE SPEAKER: And then
was there ever a project

00:22:26.570 --> 00:22:28.153
that you guys just
couldn't figure out

00:22:28.153 --> 00:22:30.930
and didn't end up in Disneyland?

00:22:30.930 --> 00:22:34.640
BOB GURR: You know,
the curious thing.

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:37.760
Today you run across so
many companies and projects

00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:41.010
that they just grind
into a terrible grind,

00:22:41.010 --> 00:22:42.360
and they just don't work.

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:44.930
And then when they do work,
they are just miserable

00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:47.930
the whole time, and
then you take them out.

00:22:47.930 --> 00:22:51.090
Walt somehow had a
sixth sense of about,

00:22:51.090 --> 00:22:55.900
how far should you go into
the future in any given

00:22:55.900 --> 00:23:00.720
direction that was not so far
that regular folks couldn't

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:02.270
do it?

00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:05.650
You couple that with a
reasonable overall starting

00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:08.790
configuration of a
project or a system.

00:23:08.790 --> 00:23:13.190
Well, what that means is that
you didn't reach out too far.

00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:16.790
By the time you get the work
spread out to everybody,

00:23:16.790 --> 00:23:21.120
everybody finds they can do
that stuff in a lot of detail

00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:22.880
because you didn't reach so far.

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:25.050
So every time I hear
the word nowadays

00:23:25.050 --> 00:23:28.630
and somebody says, well, we have
the sophisticated engineers,

00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:30.260
and oh, you know, oh, no.

00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:32.040
Don't use the word
sophistication.

00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:36.660
Sophistication means it's about
120% out instead of 110% out.

00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:40.380
And you're going to have trouble
later because any fool can

00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:42.980
convince the government to
spend money on a crazy idea,

00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:48.090
because the words are
terrific, but the parts stink.

00:23:48.090 --> 00:23:49.080
It's as simple as that.

00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:52.720
So that initial configuration
on how far you reach

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:55.640
is super critical, and
Walt was so good at that.

00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:57.810
So what I'm trying
to suggest to you

00:23:57.810 --> 00:24:01.980
is I can't recall any blind
alley we every went up,

00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:05.984
at least while I was working
there, because we were launched

00:24:05.984 --> 00:24:06.484
correctly.

00:24:08.807 --> 00:24:10.890
MALE SPEAKER: And so we're
going to take questions

00:24:10.890 --> 00:24:12.473
here in a few minutes
if you guys want

00:24:12.473 --> 00:24:14.780
to start lining up at the mic.

00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:18.310
What was-- if you're looking
in the parks today, Disneyland,

00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:23.000
Disney World, what part
or land or anything

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.370
would you like to
get involved with?

00:24:26.370 --> 00:24:29.110
BOB GURR: I'd like to
personally tear down all

00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:30.583
of Tomorrowland at Disneyland.

00:24:30.583 --> 00:24:32.166
MALE SPEAKER: This
would be universal.

00:24:32.166 --> 00:24:33.100
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:34.060
BOB GURR: Ah.

00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:36.350
Maybe you're thinking
the same here.

00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:38.660
That whole northeast
corner of the park

00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:42.100
could be something
that is somewhere

00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:46.610
between like an avatar
and a space tour,

00:24:46.610 --> 00:24:50.150
space-- any kind of a thing,
but with a lot of greenery,

00:24:50.150 --> 00:24:54.990
a lot of logic, a lot of
human scale stuff that's

00:24:54.990 --> 00:24:57.140
visually very inspiring.

00:24:57.140 --> 00:24:58.720
But it would still
have a monorail.

00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:02.707
It would still have Autopia
because, you know, bump cars.

00:25:02.707 --> 00:25:04.540
But Tesla's going to
make them, aren't they?

00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:07.930
They're going to make the little
Teslas for all the little kids,

00:25:07.930 --> 00:25:09.180
you know?

00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:12.620
But I would like to see
something that really dramatic,

00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:16.980
dynamic, but has an
inviting scale to it.

00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:18.730
It's kind of hard
to do, but in words,

00:25:18.730 --> 00:25:22.070
that's what I would-- if I could
get away with it, I'd do that.

00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:23.931
I tell everybody
we're going to do it.

00:25:23.931 --> 00:25:24.430
Yeah.

00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:25.934
I'm going to wear them out.

00:25:25.934 --> 00:25:28.100
MALE SPEAKER: How much
involvement do you have still

00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:29.224
with Disney on their parks?

00:25:29.224 --> 00:25:30.610
Do you still advise on anything?

00:25:30.610 --> 00:25:31.760
BOB GURR: No.

00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:33.900
Work is a four letter
word, and I don't do it.

00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:36.490
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:36.490 --> 00:25:38.180
I do have a simple rule.

00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:40.790
If somebody wants me to
take a look at a project,

00:25:40.790 --> 00:25:42.650
buy me a bowl of
soup at Mimi's Cafe.

00:25:42.650 --> 00:25:43.610
I'll take a look.

00:25:43.610 --> 00:25:47.460
But otherwise, work, if I
have to give out an invoice,

00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:50.210
then that's revenue, and I
don't get into any of that.

00:25:50.210 --> 00:25:50.950
No.

00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:53.350
I'd rather go take a
look and look at stuff.

00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:55.780
And I'm asked all the time.

00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:58.295
But like what we're doing here
today, a lot of times people

00:25:58.295 --> 00:26:00.200
will come up and
say, why don't you

00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:03.410
es-plain how you guys did that
stuff so fast 50 years ago?

00:26:03.410 --> 00:26:05.150
We're slow and expensive.

00:26:05.150 --> 00:26:05.890
Can you help us?

00:26:05.890 --> 00:26:07.570
So that happens all the time.

00:26:07.570 --> 00:26:08.810
Yeah.

00:26:08.810 --> 00:26:12.570
MALE SPEAKER: So for you
post-Disney, what was-- like,

00:26:12.570 --> 00:26:13.710
why did you leave Disney?

00:26:13.710 --> 00:26:16.569
Was it just time to go and
just, hey, start my own thing?

00:26:16.569 --> 00:26:19.110
Because you did start your own
company after you left Disney.

00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:20.483
BOB GURR: Yeah, they fired me.

00:26:20.483 --> 00:26:21.410
[LAUGH]

00:26:21.410 --> 00:26:22.400
No, really.

00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:26.240
I got in a dispute with a
chief engineer of the company.

00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:27.330
A simple thing.

00:26:27.330 --> 00:26:31.370
We were having some great
difficulties building Epcot.

00:26:31.370 --> 00:26:32.670
And we had a lot of engineers.

00:26:32.670 --> 00:26:34.520
By that time were
aerospace engineers

00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:36.590
who were process people.

00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:39.650
We had so much engineering that
by the time I went to the shop,

00:26:39.650 --> 00:26:42.050
none of that stuff would
work, and some of the people

00:26:42.050 --> 00:26:43.770
were really tearing
their hair out.

00:26:43.770 --> 00:26:46.885
And then in a meeting
somebody said, who can tell us

00:26:46.885 --> 00:26:47.980
why this is happening?

00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:49.466
And I said, I can tell you.

00:26:49.466 --> 00:26:51.090
And then the other
people fled the room

00:26:51.090 --> 00:26:52.470
except for the chief engineer.

00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:56.150
I didn't realize I
insulted the man.

00:26:56.150 --> 00:26:57.690
And I was fired.

00:26:57.690 --> 00:26:58.360
Simple as that.

00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:01.596
Because basically I
said, well, you know,

00:27:01.596 --> 00:27:05.200
we used to talk to the
mechanics down at Disneyland,

00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:07.270
and we'd get the
feedback from the field

00:27:07.270 --> 00:27:09.230
as to how your systems
and parts worked

00:27:09.230 --> 00:27:10.900
in very, very great detail.

00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:12.709
You can't wear a tie
and be an engineer

00:27:12.709 --> 00:27:15.000
and go down to Disneyland
and go talk to the mechanics.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.030
You've got to be a
guy just like them.

00:27:17.030 --> 00:27:20.610
They know the most
about your design,

00:27:20.610 --> 00:27:23.900
and they can be obstinate
and not tell you.

00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:27.260
Or you can befriend them
and they'll say, "Say Bob,

00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:30.200
you know this bearing, the way
you got that thing moving-- I

00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:32.140
want to show you how
it really works."

00:27:32.140 --> 00:27:34.220
That's the guy you
want to listen to.

00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:36.365
I explained that to
this chief engineer.

00:27:36.365 --> 00:27:37.990
And he looked at me
and he said-- words

00:27:37.990 --> 00:27:40.810
to the effect-- he
says, no grease monkey

00:27:40.810 --> 00:27:43.250
is ever going to tell
my licensed engineers

00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:45.680
how to design anything.

00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:49.680
And I thought, whoo.

00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:52.770
I was glad they fired me,
because within two weeks,

00:27:52.770 --> 00:27:55.400
I was president of the
Gurr Design Incorporated.

00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:55.900
And--

00:27:55.900 --> 00:27:57.050
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:57.050 --> 00:28:00.370
As you can see, you see
some projects over here

00:28:00.370 --> 00:28:02.960
that are not Disney
like a sinking

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:06.560
ship in Las Vegas, a flying
saucer in the Olympics.

00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:09.440
LA has that kind of stuff.

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:10.000
Yeah.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.640
Branching out and
doing more work.

00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:13.820
I loved having somebody
coming to me with something

00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:16.210
that had never been done
before, that was so risky nobody

00:28:16.210 --> 00:28:17.340
else wanted to do it.

00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:19.460
And if it's that
risky, I'll take it.

00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:19.960
Guess what?

00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:23.740
No, this is an invitation for
you to expand your mind more.

00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:24.790
You've had a lifetime.

00:28:24.790 --> 00:28:26.770
You're not afraid to
do some of this stuff.

00:28:26.770 --> 00:28:29.577
And you kind of know
how far out is too far.

00:28:29.577 --> 00:28:31.410
Somebody'd bring me a
crazy job, and I said,

00:28:31.410 --> 00:28:33.540
no, it's not going to
work, and I wouldn't do it.

00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:35.866
But they'd did bring
an idea, and it

00:28:35.866 --> 00:28:37.240
was like-- well,
Steve Wynn says,

00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:39.410
I want to sink a ship
on Las Vegas Boulevard,

00:28:39.410 --> 00:28:41.430
and it's burning down
while it's sinking,

00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:43.740
and it's got people on it.

00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:44.340
Yeah, Steve.

00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:46.090
There's quite a few
ways we could do that.

00:28:46.090 --> 00:28:47.364
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:47.364 --> 00:28:49.530
See the difference between
saying, that's too risky,

00:28:49.530 --> 00:28:50.520
we don't do it?

00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:52.670
No, you turn it
around the other way.

00:28:52.670 --> 00:28:55.800
But you've got a lot of projects
you've worked up here that some

00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:57.390
of them didn't go too far.

00:28:57.390 --> 00:28:59.900
But some of them
went so far, there's

00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:02.040
Google stuff we
live on in the world

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:04.120
that we can't live without.

00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:07.460
And that all had to come
from a goofy idea, you know?

00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:09.440
And you guys were not
afraid to do that.

00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:12.620
MALE SPEAKER: Well, you did
some consulting with Spielberg

00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:16.200
on "Jurassic Park" with the
first T-Rex animatronic, right?

00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:18.127
So what was that process?

00:29:18.127 --> 00:29:19.460
Did you kind of apply the same--

00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:20.340
BOB GURR: (MONOTONE
VOICE) Pro cess.

00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:21.647
MALE SPEAKER: Pro-- ah.

00:29:21.647 --> 00:29:23.230
You called me out
on it before he did.

00:29:23.230 --> 00:29:25.560
So what was it like
to work on a dinosaur?

00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:29.755
I mean, that's even
bigger than Abe Lincoln.

00:29:29.755 --> 00:29:33.760
BOB GURR: Well, Steven called,
and he says, how soon can you

00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:34.600
come talk to me?

00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:35.780
I just bought a book.

00:29:35.780 --> 00:29:36.700
It's not in print yet.

00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:38.280
It's called "Jurassic Park."

00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:39.819
I'll give you a galley proof.

00:29:39.819 --> 00:29:41.360
I still have the
galley proof printed

00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:43.190
one side only on the pages.

00:29:43.190 --> 00:29:45.160
And he says, I talked
to my guys and they

00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:47.160
said, oh, don't do anything
that big, hydraulic.

00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:48.660
This stuff doesn't work.

00:29:48.660 --> 00:29:51.590
Dino de Laurentiis' King Kong
didn't work worth a darn.

00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:55.310
I designed the King Kong
for Universal in '86,

00:29:55.310 --> 00:29:56.900
and it ran for 22 years.

00:29:56.900 --> 00:29:58.780
It didn't really give
a lick of trouble.

00:29:58.780 --> 00:29:59.490
Big machine.

00:29:59.490 --> 00:30:01.440
The bigger they
get, they're easier,

00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:03.210
because there's
more space inside.

00:30:03.210 --> 00:30:04.430
And he says, I saw it.

00:30:04.430 --> 00:30:05.060
It runs.

00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:06.220
Come talk to me.

00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:08.320
So he was working
with companies that

00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:10.660
do what we call stick
puppetry, where in other words,

00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:12.210
guys are standing
under a grating

00:30:12.210 --> 00:30:14.460
and waving a stick
around for animals.

00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:17.330
This was all before CGI.

00:30:17.330 --> 00:30:23.260
But they want to do a 30
foot tall Tyrannosaurus Rex.

00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:25.170
So I went out and I
worked out with him.

00:30:25.170 --> 00:30:27.795
Then I worked with Stan Winston
Studio who later got the job.

00:30:27.795 --> 00:30:30.170
And I had a couple of guys
that helped me with King Kong.

00:30:30.170 --> 00:30:34.480
They want to work for them to
keep the technology moving.

00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:36.910
But again, it was
a case of, there

00:30:36.910 --> 00:30:38.590
was no fear to do
a thing like that,

00:30:38.590 --> 00:30:39.855
because it was not outrageous.

00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:43.230
And they built it.

00:30:43.230 --> 00:30:46.160
And they once broke
a bearing one night,

00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:47.990
so we had a down time
of about four hours

00:30:47.990 --> 00:30:51.200
when they were
shooting the thing.

00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:52.870
But that's the kind
of stuff, working

00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:54.360
with a guy like Spielberg.

00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:56.960
He's on the job every
day, talking to everybody

00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:59.090
what they're doing.

00:30:59.090 --> 00:31:00.817
That's the way stuff gets done.

00:31:00.817 --> 00:31:03.400
MALE SPEAKER: All right So we'll
start opening up the audience

00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:04.240
questions now.

00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:05.180
AUDIENCE: Well, I was curious.

00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:06.596
Like, how did the
other Imagineers

00:31:06.596 --> 00:31:09.700
that you used to work with feel
when you got fired and left?

00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:13.190
What was that experience like?

00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:14.710
BOB GURR: They use
the expression,

00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:17.150
did you see Gurr's bomb crater?

00:31:17.150 --> 00:31:18.650
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:18.650 --> 00:31:22.700
Well, it scared some
people because they

00:31:22.700 --> 00:31:23.880
knew I was outspoken.

00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:25.580
I was always outspoken.

00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:28.010
It's just the way--
if you have opinions

00:31:28.010 --> 00:31:29.770
and you have
observations and you

00:31:29.770 --> 00:31:35.250
have a lot of life
experiences that work--

00:31:35.250 --> 00:31:39.480
and again, a lot of people
were diploma trained engineers.

00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:44.586
And they just had an attitude,
well, he's not qualified,

00:31:44.586 --> 00:31:45.085
you know?

00:31:45.085 --> 00:31:47.210
He doesn't have the diploma.

00:31:47.210 --> 00:31:49.330
He doesn't do stuff like that.

00:31:49.330 --> 00:31:51.350
I just do it anyway.

00:31:51.350 --> 00:31:53.030
So there was a mixed emotion.

00:31:53.030 --> 00:31:56.250
But over time, it turned
out to be very, very funny.

00:31:56.250 --> 00:32:00.780
People still would talk to
other people and say, you know,

00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:04.240
they fired him, but look what
he did after he got fired.

00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:06.880
There's another guy up in this
neighborhood here got fired.

00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:08.740
Pixar, John Lasseter.

00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:10.990
He got fired too.

00:32:10.990 --> 00:32:13.000
And look what he went and did.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:17.414
So a lot of times, you'll have
ornery people in a company that

00:32:17.414 --> 00:32:19.580
don't necessarily behave
the way you're supposed to,

00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:21.270
and they have
their own opinions.

00:32:21.270 --> 00:32:24.240
And they will cycle through a
company, and some of volunteer

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:26.390
to leave, some of
them will get fired.

00:32:26.390 --> 00:32:28.780
But that does show that
there's different paths

00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:30.960
that people take.

00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:35.260
But I know it does
irritate managers to have

00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:36.570
those kind of employees.

00:32:36.570 --> 00:32:37.280
Yeah.

00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:38.700
AUDIENCE: And then when
you became a Disney legend,

00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:41.075
do you feel like that kind of
liberated you in everything

00:32:41.075 --> 00:32:42.930
you did, or that experience?

00:32:42.930 --> 00:32:44.570
BOB GURR: No, you
know the funny thing?

00:32:44.570 --> 00:32:48.620
My basic pay was watching
the smiles on people's faces

00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:50.430
when they go to an attraction.

00:32:50.430 --> 00:32:54.440
And that's like-- well, like
when we opened King Kong up,

00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:57.060
took the first ride, and I
watched the people coming out.

00:32:57.060 --> 00:32:58.870
And the older
people were staring,

00:32:58.870 --> 00:33:00.370
and the middle
people were clapping,

00:33:00.370 --> 00:33:01.850
and the kids were crying.

00:33:01.850 --> 00:33:03.400
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:06.060
Boy, a 30 foot tall gorilla.

00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:07.520
I know all the parts are there.

00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:10.130
And it's like, yes!

00:33:10.130 --> 00:33:12.480
But when you have a legend
or a window on Main Street--

00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:15.420
I've got a whole bunch
of awards for stuff.

00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:17.510
It's nice to be recognized.

00:33:17.510 --> 00:33:19.650
But the real
recognition is when you

00:33:19.650 --> 00:33:22.930
go to someplace that your stuff
works, and it's still working,

00:33:22.930 --> 00:33:25.880
and you're having a good time
watching them have a good time.

00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:27.215
So that's the pay part.

00:33:27.215 --> 00:33:27.840
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:28.340
Thank you.

00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:29.400
BOB GURR: OK.

00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:30.984
Next.

00:33:30.984 --> 00:33:32.900
AUDIENCE: So the Haunted
Mansion at Disneyland

00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:36.730
has always been one of my
favorite attractions there.

00:33:36.730 --> 00:33:40.620
As a kid, I was always awestruck
by just how unique it was.

00:33:40.620 --> 00:33:42.950
And then as I grew up,
you still go through it,

00:33:42.950 --> 00:33:45.830
and it's amazing when you try
to go through and actually

00:33:45.830 --> 00:33:49.640
try to figure out how some
of these illusions were made.

00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:53.250
Was there anything when
designing the Haunted Mansion

00:33:53.250 --> 00:33:55.160
that-- there were
ideas that came up

00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:58.511
that were just too out there
or too crazy to actually build?

00:33:58.511 --> 00:34:00.760
BOB GURR: Well, if you know
the history of the Haunted

00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:02.630
Mansion-- some of you
might be Disney fans,

00:34:02.630 --> 00:34:04.480
might have read about that.

00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:07.230
For a number of
years, Walt had a guy

00:34:07.230 --> 00:34:10.159
by the name of Yale Gracie,
one of our free thinkers,

00:34:10.159 --> 00:34:13.380
just figuring out
gags all the time.

00:34:13.380 --> 00:34:14.770
So we had a string of gags.

00:34:14.770 --> 00:34:17.170
And it was going to
be a walk-through.

00:34:17.170 --> 00:34:23.040
But it was difficult to plan
guest flow in a walk-through.

00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:25.489
Monsanto, the Voyage
Thru Inner Space.

00:34:25.489 --> 00:34:26.920
Anybody remember that one?

00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:30.889
Yeah, you've got to be a little
bit older to remember that one.

00:34:30.889 --> 00:34:34.780
I suddenly had an idea
for a conveyor that

00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:37.810
could have a car on it that
you could rotate the car

00:34:37.810 --> 00:34:40.000
and pitch it up, pitch
it down, that you

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.659
could point the guest--
like going through a movie,

00:34:42.659 --> 00:34:44.780
you could control the scenes.

00:34:44.780 --> 00:34:47.840
And it would be an
endless chain of vehicles.

00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:50.840
Well, the minute the people
working on the Haunted Mansion

00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:53.000
gags, they said, oh.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:54.120
We'll make it a ride.

00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:56.290
Now we can control
the whole thing.

00:34:56.290 --> 00:34:59.610
So it was an attraction
that came about maybe

00:34:59.610 --> 00:35:02.140
in a year and a half,
but it was like 10 years

00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:04.490
with ideas slowly forming.

00:35:04.490 --> 00:35:08.540
So it's a curious combination
of a high speed conveyor

00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:12.100
mixed in with a
bunch of illusions

00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:14.244
that now became movie scenes.

00:35:14.244 --> 00:35:15.160
AUDIENCE: Interesting.

00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:17.900
Thank you.

00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:19.340
AUDIENCE: A couple questions.

00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:23.080
When you talked about how
Disney would pop in and give you

00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:24.900
some great idea to
start working on,

00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:26.810
and it would happen
really quickly,

00:35:26.810 --> 00:35:29.240
did you have other guys popping
in on you and telling you

00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:29.850
what to do?

00:35:29.850 --> 00:35:33.570
Or other people you
had to answer to?

00:35:33.570 --> 00:35:34.946
How did that work?

00:35:34.946 --> 00:35:37.760
[LAUGH]

00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:39.260
BOB GURR: That's a good one.

00:35:39.260 --> 00:35:41.880
I don't recall anybody
telling me what to do.

00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:43.260
[LAUGH]

00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:46.440
I'm just that kind of a person.

00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:49.230
We all literally consulted
with one another.

00:35:49.230 --> 00:35:52.570
Because what I said a little
bit earlier, in those days

00:35:52.570 --> 00:35:54.570
we did not have
project managers.

00:35:54.570 --> 00:35:56.680
We did not have coordinators.

00:35:56.680 --> 00:36:00.530
Everybody doing the work
at all different levels,

00:36:00.530 --> 00:36:02.720
the sum of them
chatting every day

00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:06.070
was the project management team.

00:36:06.070 --> 00:36:07.570
Stop and think about that.

00:36:07.570 --> 00:36:12.030
A lot of times, companies will
have sometimes more managers

00:36:12.030 --> 00:36:14.710
and coordinators than
they've actually got people

00:36:14.710 --> 00:36:17.130
with their hands on a product.

00:36:17.130 --> 00:36:20.490
That changes the cost
structure completely.

00:36:20.490 --> 00:36:23.750
At one time, I became so
irritated with projects getting

00:36:23.750 --> 00:36:27.270
slowed down, a coordinator
would come in and says, Bob,

00:36:27.270 --> 00:36:30.181
I have to ask you these
questions and explain all this.

00:36:30.181 --> 00:36:32.680
And every time I'd explain it,
they didn't know what it was,

00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:35.430
and then I'd have to
explain the explanation.

00:36:35.430 --> 00:36:37.910
And I said, what are you
going to do with this?

00:36:37.910 --> 00:36:40.040
Well, I'm going to take
it and make a report,

00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:43.360
and I'm going to give it
to our project manager.

00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:46.860
Well, your hands are
not on the product.

00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:49.050
If I stop and talk
to you, do you

00:36:49.050 --> 00:36:51.290
realize you just
stopped the project?

00:36:51.290 --> 00:36:52.839
My hands are on the project.

00:36:52.839 --> 00:36:55.380
And that was a lesson that went
through that company so fast,

00:36:55.380 --> 00:36:58.780
and we still used it
in later companies.

00:36:58.780 --> 00:37:01.486
If you're doing the work,
you're part of the managers.

00:37:01.486 --> 00:37:03.610
You're part of the
coordinators, and you don't need

00:37:03.610 --> 00:37:04.734
everybody else to go do it.

00:37:04.734 --> 00:37:06.670
You can't do that in all
companies, of course.

00:37:06.670 --> 00:37:08.150
Some of this is very complex.

00:37:08.150 --> 00:37:10.390
But that was a
principle that was

00:37:10.390 --> 00:37:13.460
present in those
years, the speed of how

00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:15.190
things got done so quick.

00:37:15.190 --> 00:37:20.110
AUDIENCE: So how quickly did
that change after Disney died?

00:37:20.110 --> 00:37:22.540
BOB GURR: It was not
because of Walt's passing.

00:37:22.540 --> 00:37:26.050
It was more because Disney
was expanding quite rapidly

00:37:26.050 --> 00:37:29.050
in the '70s, because we were
doing Walt Disney World,

00:37:29.050 --> 00:37:30.510
getting ready to do Epcot.

00:37:30.510 --> 00:37:33.650
And remember '90, '91,
the aerospace industry

00:37:33.650 --> 00:37:36.927
kind of collapsed after
Gorbachev and Reagan agreed

00:37:36.927 --> 00:37:39.010
to tear down the Wall, and
all that sort of stuff.

00:37:39.010 --> 00:37:41.590
So we didn't have a
lot of military work.

00:37:41.590 --> 00:37:44.070
So all these engineers,
they're all floating around,

00:37:44.070 --> 00:37:46.370
and Disney started
picking them up.

00:37:46.370 --> 00:37:51.030
They brought processes, oh.

00:37:51.030 --> 00:37:56.250
I tell you, meeting an
aerospace engineer over 50 was,

00:37:56.250 --> 00:37:58.700
oh, my God.

00:37:58.700 --> 00:38:02.370
Just they don't think.

00:38:02.370 --> 00:38:04.040
They just do.

00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:06.540
They only do stuff
the way they do stuff.

00:38:06.540 --> 00:38:08.340
And we hired an
awful lot of them.

00:38:08.340 --> 00:38:11.560
And that was the
period where it got

00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:13.620
very sluggish, very sluggish.

00:38:13.620 --> 00:38:17.600
We're on probably our third
generation of Imagineers now.

00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:19.800
And luckily, we do find
a lot of people that

00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:21.410
didn't come out of aerospace.

00:38:21.410 --> 00:38:23.590
They come out of very
enthusiastic types

00:38:23.590 --> 00:38:26.490
of schools and trades
that they like to do.

00:38:26.490 --> 00:38:29.990
So it's a little easier now.

00:38:29.990 --> 00:38:32.340
But there was that
middle period,

00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:34.512
because the way I told you.

00:38:34.512 --> 00:38:35.720
AUDIENCE: One other question.

00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:37.981
Can you talk about testing?

00:38:37.981 --> 00:38:38.730
BOB GURR: Testing?

00:38:38.730 --> 00:38:39.902
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:38:39.902 --> 00:38:44.540
When you were about to set these
attractions loose on people,

00:38:44.540 --> 00:38:46.790
what gave you any
confidence that--

00:38:46.790 --> 00:38:49.460
BOB GURR: Well, in the
case of the monorail,

00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:51.460
I put the red train
on the beam two weeks

00:38:51.460 --> 00:38:54.640
before we were going to
have the grand opening.

00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:57.850
So we had two weeks to do
what we call test and adjust.

00:38:57.850 --> 00:39:01.760
But in that case, the first
trip the monorail made, and I

00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:04.760
was at the controls, it went
an eighth of an inch with a log

00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:06.430
electrical explosion.

00:39:06.430 --> 00:39:06.930
And--

00:39:06.930 --> 00:39:07.430
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:07.430 --> 00:39:08.710
Oh, and Walt was in the train.

00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:10.959
But he just got out and
looked at me, and walked away.

00:39:10.959 --> 00:39:12.570
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:12.570 --> 00:39:14.422
No, that's all true story.

00:39:14.422 --> 00:39:15.130
You got the book.

00:39:15.130 --> 00:39:17.060
It's in the book there.

00:39:17.060 --> 00:39:19.890
Every day for the
following two weeks,

00:39:19.890 --> 00:39:22.600
the train ran and got
almost all the way around,

00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:24.600
and then stopped, and
then we towed it in.

00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:27.680
And so we came up with
a fix every night.

00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:29.780
Machine shop worked
at night doing it.

00:39:29.780 --> 00:39:32.992
The day before
the grand opening,

00:39:32.992 --> 00:39:34.700
when the vice president
was going to come

00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:38.110
take a ride in it, that's the
only time the train ran around

00:39:38.110 --> 00:39:40.290
one full lap and didn't stop.

00:39:40.290 --> 00:39:41.672
So I parked it.

00:39:41.672 --> 00:39:43.130
So we were going
to cut the ribbon.

00:39:43.130 --> 00:39:48.350
When we drive out of the
TV shot, and we're OK.

00:39:48.350 --> 00:39:49.140
That's testing.

00:39:49.140 --> 00:39:50.190
That's what we did.

00:39:50.190 --> 00:39:51.830
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:51.830 --> 00:39:54.920
We didn't have time to
train the operators.

00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:55.840
We had them all hired.

00:39:55.840 --> 00:39:58.650
So they made me a monorail
operator's costume

00:39:58.650 --> 00:40:00.200
on the graveyard shift.

00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:03.460
So I was the driver.

00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:04.900
AUDIENCE: You didn't have SREs?

00:40:04.900 --> 00:40:05.483
BOB GURR: Huh?

00:40:05.483 --> 00:40:06.250
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:06.250 --> 00:40:07.240
Yeah.

00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:08.660
Well, nowadays the current--

00:40:08.660 --> 00:40:09.910
AUDIENCE: Liability engineers?

00:40:09.910 --> 00:40:11.080
[LAUGH]

00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:11.880
BOB GURR: No.

00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:12.520
No, really.

00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:15.380
People were very sensible.

00:40:15.380 --> 00:40:17.282
Safety is the absolute
number one stuff.

00:40:17.282 --> 00:40:19.240
Remember, this thing's
up in the air, you know?

00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:20.960
It's going to go
35 miles per hour,

00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:22.700
and you don't want
anybody-- don't

00:40:22.700 --> 00:40:26.920
want it to fall of the beam
or parts fall out of it.

00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:30.426
You are always-- public
safety in amusement parks

00:40:30.426 --> 00:40:31.800
is right in the
top of your head.

00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:34.370
Every decision
you make in detail

00:40:34.370 --> 00:40:37.380
is looking at the safety
of a ride operation.

00:40:37.380 --> 00:40:39.735
It's kind of automatic.

00:40:39.735 --> 00:40:43.420
You don't have somebody
doing that as a service.

00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:45.230
You're doing it
internally because that's

00:40:45.230 --> 00:40:47.390
what you have to do.

00:40:47.390 --> 00:40:47.890
Yeah.

00:40:47.890 --> 00:40:48.723
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:40:48.723 --> 00:40:49.754
BOB GURR: Yeah.

00:40:49.754 --> 00:40:51.380
AUDIENCE: And so
you said that a lot

00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:53.446
of the organizational
culture comes

00:40:53.446 --> 00:40:54.570
from the people at the top.

00:40:54.570 --> 00:40:58.483
So like you said, Steve Wynn
or John Lasseter or Walt

00:40:58.483 --> 00:41:00.240
is sending those values down.

00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:04.675
Like, as companies expand
and as leaders may or may not

00:41:04.675 --> 00:41:07.930
have that philosophy, how do you
gain it if you don't have it,

00:41:07.930 --> 00:41:11.650
and how do you keep
it going if you do?

00:41:11.650 --> 00:41:12.650
BOB GURR: Yeah.

00:41:12.650 --> 00:41:15.250
For your career, you
should be very smart

00:41:15.250 --> 00:41:17.170
and research the company
you're going to join,

00:41:17.170 --> 00:41:21.730
because they might have
dumb people at the top.

00:41:21.730 --> 00:41:27.060
You want to find a company that
has smart thinkers at the top.

00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:28.750
I think all of you
found that company.

00:41:32.030 --> 00:41:34.960
It's a brutal way to
answer that question.

00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:36.050
There are some companies.

00:41:36.050 --> 00:41:38.154
Get going, and they're
just-- over time,

00:41:38.154 --> 00:41:39.820
they're not really
good at what they do.

00:41:39.820 --> 00:41:41.920
But there's a whole
bunch of other companies

00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:45.000
that they just change
the world right and left.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:47.310
There's something about
this part of the planet.

00:41:47.310 --> 00:41:49.340
I don't know whether it's
the water or the air,

00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:54.360
but there's a level of go
do stuff that's interesting

00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:56.110
up in this area here.

00:41:56.110 --> 00:41:59.000
I don't know quite what it
is, but it's very unique,

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:00.610
and there's a lot
of people gravitated

00:42:00.610 --> 00:42:03.700
here just because of that.

00:42:03.700 --> 00:42:06.480
That's probably not an answer,
but that's my observation.

00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:07.240
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:42:07.240 --> 00:42:07.781
BOB GURR: OK.

00:42:10.430 --> 00:42:11.300
AUDIENCE: Hi, Bob.

00:42:11.300 --> 00:42:13.050
I worked at Disneyland
for two summers,

00:42:13.050 --> 00:42:16.090
and it was just a thrill working
around all your achievements

00:42:16.090 --> 00:42:17.880
and works, so thank you.

00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:20.080
I guess I'm wondering,
how did you collaborate

00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:22.720
with animators or kind
of the arts department,

00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:25.575
just to kind of gel art
and engineering together?

00:42:25.575 --> 00:42:27.450
BOB GURR: Remember what
I was saying earlier.

00:42:27.450 --> 00:42:30.290
We all talked to one
another all the time.

00:42:30.290 --> 00:42:32.910
It was a very common
thing that since we

00:42:32.910 --> 00:42:36.580
didn't have what we would
call a matrix organization,

00:42:36.580 --> 00:42:39.140
if you wanted to know something,
go find out who's got it

00:42:39.140 --> 00:42:41.440
and go find out where
you can find them.

00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:43.890
And we just really walked
all over that studio lot.

00:42:43.890 --> 00:42:46.570
We still do that at Walt
Disney Imagineering,

00:42:46.570 --> 00:42:48.430
which is now in Glendale.

00:42:48.430 --> 00:42:50.480
You don't necessarily have
to wait for a meeting.

00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:53.714
Go call somebody up or
go over and talk to them.

00:42:53.714 --> 00:42:56.130
You don't have to go with a
manager or anything like that.

00:42:56.130 --> 00:42:57.434
Just go ask.

00:42:57.434 --> 00:42:59.100
AUDIENCE: What would
come first usually?

00:42:59.100 --> 00:43:02.800
Like a technical idea,
or an artistic one?

00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:04.230
BOB GURR: It's a blend.

00:43:04.230 --> 00:43:07.590
I mentioned earlier, Walt
was very technically savvy

00:43:07.590 --> 00:43:11.170
about new techniques, new
tools, stuff like that.

00:43:11.170 --> 00:43:13.500
And he could see how
you could take a tool

00:43:13.500 --> 00:43:16.880
and help tell a story
in an improved way.

00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:18.770
And that was a blend
coming out of movies,

00:43:18.770 --> 00:43:20.390
coming out of animation.

00:43:20.390 --> 00:43:24.900
Because remember, he did both
film and hand drawn animation.

00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:27.270
And of course, the company's
gone on past all that

00:43:27.270 --> 00:43:30.850
with Pixar, because it's
a lot of CGI nowadays.

00:43:30.850 --> 00:43:32.340
But it's a blend.

00:43:32.340 --> 00:43:34.730
Remember, we're still
telling the story.

00:43:34.730 --> 00:43:37.850
You know, if it's "Toy Story"
with Pixar and John Lasseter,

00:43:37.850 --> 00:43:39.580
that's a story.

00:43:39.580 --> 00:43:41.180
Movies done exactly
the same way.

00:43:41.180 --> 00:43:45.750
You go to Disneyland, you go
to, like, the pirate ride.

00:43:45.750 --> 00:43:46.520
That's a story.

00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:47.590
We're telling stories.

00:43:47.590 --> 00:43:51.310
We just happen to do it in
physical 3D without glasses.

00:43:51.310 --> 00:43:54.640
You ride in the boat,
and that's a story.

00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:56.320
So that's a common thread.

00:43:56.320 --> 00:44:00.140
It doesn't matter whether it's
animation, mechanical, writing,

00:44:00.140 --> 00:44:00.975
or whatever.

00:44:00.975 --> 00:44:01.947
It's storytelling.

00:44:01.947 --> 00:44:02.780
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:44:06.442 --> 00:44:07.900
AUDIENCE: So when
you were building

00:44:07.900 --> 00:44:10.130
new rides and new
things, how did you

00:44:10.130 --> 00:44:14.100
balance between design and
drawing and the planning side,

00:44:14.100 --> 00:44:16.720
versus having somebody
just go experiment, fiddle,

00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:18.532
and see what they can build?

00:44:18.532 --> 00:44:19.990
BOB GURR: Yeah, we
did all of that.

00:44:19.990 --> 00:44:24.535
And we didn't necessarily have
departments that did that.

00:44:24.535 --> 00:44:27.360
In the earlier days,
since everybody

00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:29.410
was talking to one
another-- and we

00:44:29.410 --> 00:44:31.860
had a very strange
way of running

00:44:31.860 --> 00:44:35.620
WED Enterprise in those days--
the company deliberately

00:44:35.620 --> 00:44:38.040
did not let any of
the creative people

00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:40.830
learn what anything cost.

00:44:40.830 --> 00:44:44.000
I mean that's really weird.

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:47.160
The interesting thing
was time was so tight.

00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:49.660
Like when Walt would
start a project,

00:44:49.660 --> 00:44:53.620
he'd set the day they were going
to call the media in and have

00:44:53.620 --> 00:44:55.650
the grand opening,
and then you'd

00:44:55.650 --> 00:44:59.190
work backwards with
everything to the present day.

00:44:59.190 --> 00:45:01.010
And everybody
could automatically

00:45:01.010 --> 00:45:03.400
see that, oh, my God.

00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:05.940
We don't have any
time to waste here.

00:45:05.940 --> 00:45:09.040
So you automatically
go fast, and you

00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:11.310
didn't need to budget it.

00:45:11.310 --> 00:45:14.520
Budgeting in a way
is almost foolish

00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:19.520
because the guy doing the
budget has never built anything.

00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:21.800
And the budget is
always going to be

00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:24.180
blown up or down, either way.

00:45:24.180 --> 00:45:25.860
So the point is,
don't have the budget.

00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:29.140
Use your smarts and go fast
with your own intelligence.

00:45:29.140 --> 00:45:30.830
And that works,
and that's the way

00:45:30.830 --> 00:45:33.857
Disney got a lot of
stuff done in those days.

00:45:33.857 --> 00:45:34.690
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:45:34.690 --> 00:45:35.231
BOB GURR: OK.

00:45:38.310 --> 00:45:39.560
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:42.441
Are there any projects that you
wish you had gotten to first?

00:45:42.441 --> 00:45:43.940
And are there any
that you might not

00:45:43.940 --> 00:45:46.356
have been spearheading, but
that you feel you kind of made

00:45:46.356 --> 00:45:49.320
a legendary contribution to?

00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:53.900
BOB GURR: Ooh, that's a
kind of a complicated one.

00:45:53.900 --> 00:45:57.560
You know, I never
basically originated

00:45:57.560 --> 00:45:59.290
an attraction concept.

00:45:59.290 --> 00:46:01.610
I was always the guy
that somebody went to

00:46:01.610 --> 00:46:05.520
after they had an idea, where
it was in the word stage.

00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:08.719
Primarily words, maybe
a little bit of artwork.

00:46:08.719 --> 00:46:10.260
And then I would
see it, and then I'd

00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:12.140
say, oh, I can see
how to do that.

00:46:12.140 --> 00:46:14.850
But it was not where I
would be the guy that

00:46:14.850 --> 00:46:16.360
would suggest the idea.

00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:22.440
It's kind of a moot
question in the standpoint

00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:26.250
that I did so many things,
such a big variety,

00:46:26.250 --> 00:46:28.740
it'd be a tough one
to say which one would

00:46:28.740 --> 00:46:31.950
I have liked it done
that was not done.

00:46:31.950 --> 00:46:34.030
In Disney, I was
pretty much satisfied.

00:46:34.030 --> 00:46:35.740
Everything I got a chance to do.

00:46:35.740 --> 00:46:38.060
But in the mechanical
design area,

00:46:38.060 --> 00:46:42.086
there was one thing I would
have always liked to do.

00:46:42.086 --> 00:46:44.570
Design an animated
Rose Parade float

00:46:44.570 --> 00:46:46.910
for the Tournament
of Roses in Pasadena.

00:46:46.910 --> 00:46:48.454
But nobody called.

00:46:48.454 --> 00:46:49.390
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:49.390 --> 00:46:54.690
But I would talk my way into
the places that designed them

00:46:54.690 --> 00:46:58.537
and do them, and climb up
inside them on a couple days

00:46:58.537 --> 00:47:01.120
later when they were taking them
apart to see how they did it.

00:47:01.120 --> 00:47:03.640
And I have a good
lady friend that

00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:07.920
works over at one of the
biggest manufacturers of floats.

00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:11.070
And they invite me over
several times in the year

00:47:11.070 --> 00:47:13.490
so I can see the start
of the framework,

00:47:13.490 --> 00:47:15.807
see how the covering's
done, then go and see

00:47:15.807 --> 00:47:17.140
how they put all the flowers in.

00:47:17.140 --> 00:47:18.322
So, yeah.

00:47:18.322 --> 00:47:19.530
I know how that stuff's done.

00:47:19.530 --> 00:47:20.650
It's really clever stuff.

00:47:20.650 --> 00:47:22.841
But I just wish somebody
would have called.

00:47:22.841 --> 00:47:24.090
I would [INAUDIBLE] done that.

00:47:24.090 --> 00:47:24.950
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:47:24.950 --> 00:47:25.783
BOB GURR: All right.

00:47:28.670 --> 00:47:30.020
How we doing on the time here?

00:47:30.020 --> 00:47:31.380
MALE SPEAKER: We're
pretty good, actually.

00:47:31.380 --> 00:47:31.820
BOB GURR: All right.

00:47:31.820 --> 00:47:33.195
MALE SPEAKER: No
time, no budget.

00:47:33.195 --> 00:47:34.028
BOB GURR: All right.

00:47:34.028 --> 00:47:34.660
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:34.660 --> 00:47:36.990
AUDIENCE: I have
two quick questions.

00:47:36.990 --> 00:47:39.410
What do you look at when
you go to a theme park

00:47:39.410 --> 00:47:43.255
today, whether it's a
Disney park or another down

00:47:43.255 --> 00:47:43.755
the street?

00:47:43.755 --> 00:47:46.120
Like, how do you
experience a theme park?

00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:47.220
BOB GURR: OK.

00:47:47.220 --> 00:47:50.170
I'll answer it in this way.

00:47:50.170 --> 00:47:54.040
I was made a Lifetime--
what do they call them?

00:47:54.040 --> 00:47:57.050
Life-- Lifetime something
for the Themed Entertainment

00:47:57.050 --> 00:47:57.960
Association.

00:47:57.960 --> 00:48:01.850
And if you have that
honor they give you,

00:48:01.850 --> 00:48:05.090
you're automatically on the
awards committee for life.

00:48:05.090 --> 00:48:11.830
And I've been on that committee
now-- gosh, since 1999.

00:48:11.830 --> 00:48:14.610
And every year, we have
about 140 nominations

00:48:14.610 --> 00:48:17.130
come in for
entertainment projects

00:48:17.130 --> 00:48:20.440
of all kinds in the
themed business worldwide.

00:48:20.440 --> 00:48:22.230
So this is my reconnaissance.

00:48:22.230 --> 00:48:25.050
I get to snoop and see
what everybody is doing

00:48:25.050 --> 00:48:26.800
and how they do it.

00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:30.040
And in some cases, we go out and
actually look at the attraction

00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:32.030
and go experience it.

00:48:32.030 --> 00:48:34.890
So I'm in a position
that every year, I

00:48:34.890 --> 00:48:38.170
can see what the entire
industry as a group is doing.

00:48:38.170 --> 00:48:40.380
We have maybe 20 people
on our committee,

00:48:40.380 --> 00:48:42.900
and they're all people
that are basically

00:48:42.900 --> 00:48:47.040
presidents of companies or
lead designers of companies,

00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:48.470
and some of them are like me.

00:48:48.470 --> 00:48:51.420
They're retired legends
that come in there

00:48:51.420 --> 00:48:53.020
and look at everything.

00:48:53.020 --> 00:48:58.050
So it's interesting to follow
this constant improvement

00:48:58.050 --> 00:48:59.380
of everything.

00:48:59.380 --> 00:49:03.130
Now specifically it was
a specific theme park,

00:49:03.130 --> 00:49:05.740
as you know, Themed
Entertainment Association

00:49:05.740 --> 00:49:08.510
has given out two
awards in two past years

00:49:08.510 --> 00:49:13.220
for the Wizarding World of Harry
Potter at Universal, Florida.

00:49:13.220 --> 00:49:16.030
And then most
recently, Diagon Alley.

00:49:16.030 --> 00:49:19.580
So when I go to those
places, I'm sort of like,

00:49:19.580 --> 00:49:21.950
how come Disney can't do
stuff as good as they're

00:49:21.950 --> 00:49:23.030
doing nowadays?

00:49:23.030 --> 00:49:26.070
But it does show that as
a company gets very mature

00:49:26.070 --> 00:49:27.910
and the management
gets very, very large,

00:49:27.910 --> 00:49:30.857
it's hard to do what would
be, like, risky stuff.

00:49:30.857 --> 00:49:33.190
But a company like Universal,
they're are a lot smaller,

00:49:33.190 --> 00:49:35.270
and they have a
design team that might

00:49:35.270 --> 00:49:38.950
be a 10th of the size of
Walt Disney Imagineering.

00:49:38.950 --> 00:49:41.810
And those guys, like you
guys, those are fast thinkers.

00:49:41.810 --> 00:49:44.860
And they decide, and they
move very, very fast.

00:49:44.860 --> 00:49:48.870
They're doing another
one at Hollywood Studios.

00:49:48.870 --> 00:49:51.650
Most recently,
Knott's Berry Farm,

00:49:51.650 --> 00:49:54.100
which is a smaller
type of park, opened

00:49:54.100 --> 00:49:58.240
an attraction called the
Voyage to the Iron Reef.

00:49:58.240 --> 00:50:02.060
And it's a shoot 'em up
ride with a ride conveyance.

00:50:02.060 --> 00:50:05.610
Four people sit in a row and
you've got these blaster guns,

00:50:05.610 --> 00:50:07.522
and you're shooting scenes.

00:50:07.522 --> 00:50:09.230
How many people have
been to Midway Mania

00:50:09.230 --> 00:50:10.561
down at Disneyland?

00:50:10.561 --> 00:50:11.060
OK.

00:50:11.060 --> 00:50:14.020
Visualize a vehicle
that never stops.

00:50:14.020 --> 00:50:15.450
The screens are endless.

00:50:15.450 --> 00:50:16.610
You don't stop in a scene.

00:50:16.610 --> 00:50:19.500
You don't see work lights,
so you don't see the track.

00:50:19.500 --> 00:50:21.800
You have guns, and they're
all a different color.

00:50:21.800 --> 00:50:23.300
So when you shoot
something, you can

00:50:23.300 --> 00:50:26.070
see which color's
getting the most scores

00:50:26.070 --> 00:50:27.510
by the way the thing blows up.

00:50:27.510 --> 00:50:31.240
And it's got 3D animation,
the best I have ever seen.

00:50:31.240 --> 00:50:32.991
And it's a small
company in Toronto,

00:50:32.991 --> 00:50:35.240
and they built a whole
attraction like that for, like,

00:50:35.240 --> 00:50:36.840
$5 million.

00:50:36.840 --> 00:50:40.850
Where somebody else would
spend $100 million, and it's

00:50:40.850 --> 00:50:42.000
very complicated.

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:45.060
So getting a chance to go
snoop at all these things,

00:50:45.060 --> 00:50:47.540
and of course with Knott's
they said, come on down.

00:50:47.540 --> 00:50:51.110
And you help me the
VIP to open the thing

00:50:51.110 --> 00:50:52.200
and take the first ride.

00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:53.150
And I said, yeah.

00:50:53.150 --> 00:50:55.094
Before I do that, I want
to go see everything.

00:50:55.094 --> 00:50:57.260
I'm crawling under the
vehicles, and the president's

00:50:57.260 --> 00:50:59.740
watching me calling around,
looking at everything.

00:50:59.740 --> 00:51:01.710
I want to know how
everything is done,

00:51:01.710 --> 00:51:05.110
because that's-- that's a long
winded answer to your question.

00:51:05.110 --> 00:51:07.380
I want to know everything
about everything.

00:51:07.380 --> 00:51:09.600
AUDIENCE: And then
another quick question

00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:11.150
about theme park philosophy.

00:51:11.150 --> 00:51:13.420
Like, how do you balance
the need for nostalgia

00:51:13.420 --> 00:51:14.890
with the need for something new?

00:51:14.890 --> 00:51:16.120
You look at Disneyland.

00:51:16.120 --> 00:51:18.842
There's the annual
passholder's there for 60 years

00:51:18.842 --> 00:51:20.300
going all the time
on the weekends.

00:51:20.300 --> 00:51:21.300
You'll get Disney World.

00:51:21.300 --> 00:51:23.550
It's more of a
destination place that you

00:51:23.550 --> 00:51:25.470
go to once every few years.

00:51:25.470 --> 00:51:27.510
So how do you balance
the old attractions

00:51:27.510 --> 00:51:30.279
with the new attractions
in those theme parks?

00:51:30.279 --> 00:51:31.570
BOB GURR: This guy's dangerous.

00:51:31.570 --> 00:51:34.170
He just asked the question
that's the hardest, hardest

00:51:34.170 --> 00:51:37.180
question for anybody in the
theme entertainment industry.

00:51:37.180 --> 00:51:39.100
Because on the one
hand, you'll have

00:51:39.100 --> 00:51:41.970
a family that loves
an attraction,

00:51:41.970 --> 00:51:43.950
and they want to go
every year, and they

00:51:43.950 --> 00:51:45.840
don't want it to ever change.

00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:48.420
You'll have another family
that goes and that says,

00:51:48.420 --> 00:51:49.276
same old stuff.

00:51:49.276 --> 00:51:50.900
Why don't they ever
tear that stuff out

00:51:50.900 --> 00:51:52.720
and do something neat?

00:51:52.720 --> 00:51:56.150
That range is hopeless.

00:51:56.150 --> 00:51:58.610
I don't think anybody's
ever going to solve that.

00:51:58.610 --> 00:52:00.080
It's a balance.

00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:03.820
Because guaranteed, you're
upsetting everybody.

00:52:03.820 --> 00:52:06.420
The ones that are upset because
you took it out, and the one's

00:52:06.420 --> 00:52:10.075
that are upset because
it's still there.

00:52:10.075 --> 00:52:10.700
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:52:10.700 --> 00:52:11.199
Thanks.

00:52:13.980 --> 00:52:14.950
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:52:14.950 --> 00:52:17.610
Thank you for being here
and answering our questions.

00:52:17.610 --> 00:52:19.520
I have a question
about Halloween.

00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:22.530
I wonder if it's a holiday
that you enjoy celebrating.

00:52:22.530 --> 00:52:23.674
I know you're an inventor.

00:52:23.674 --> 00:52:25.090
So it's coming up
in a few months,

00:52:25.090 --> 00:52:27.725
and I wonder if you
had anything to share

00:52:27.725 --> 00:52:29.850
about what you've done in
the past to celebrate it.

00:52:29.850 --> 00:52:31.570
Things you've invented
or projects you

00:52:31.570 --> 00:52:33.480
think we could
possibly do ourselves.

00:52:33.480 --> 00:52:35.520
BOB GURR: Halloween.

00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:36.432
Yep.

00:52:36.432 --> 00:52:41.796
Now you're asking me to
do concept idea stuff.

00:52:41.796 --> 00:52:43.420
Now you've got to
bring the concept in,

00:52:43.420 --> 00:52:45.050
and I'll make the machine work.

00:52:45.050 --> 00:52:48.140
So that question's
a little bit hard.

00:52:48.140 --> 00:52:51.110
But Halloween is-- how many
of you know the real history

00:52:51.110 --> 00:52:54.350
of Halloween over 100 years?

00:52:54.350 --> 00:52:56.940
It has changed completely.

00:52:56.940 --> 00:53:00.470
So that nowadays, Halloween
is entirely different.

00:53:00.470 --> 00:53:04.230
There's a big Halloween
product display

00:53:04.230 --> 00:53:05.710
that I go to every year in LA.

00:53:05.710 --> 00:53:07.900
I think it's called ScareLA.

00:53:07.900 --> 00:53:10.200
That's the craziest stuff
I've ever seen people do,

00:53:10.200 --> 00:53:12.130
and it gets crazier every year.

00:53:12.130 --> 00:53:14.050
So I'm aware of it,
but I don't really

00:53:14.050 --> 00:53:17.730
know enough to say what's
good or bad or what.

00:53:17.730 --> 00:53:20.720
But there's so many people
creating stuff for Halloween.

00:53:20.720 --> 00:53:22.747
It's endless.

00:53:22.747 --> 00:53:24.330
AUDIENCE: Thank you
so much for coming

00:53:24.330 --> 00:53:27.150
to talk to us, and also for
your contributions to Disney.

00:53:27.150 --> 00:53:30.460
There's something about the
physicality of animatronics

00:53:30.460 --> 00:53:31.977
that's, for me, totally unique.

00:53:31.977 --> 00:53:33.310
I don't get it from video games.

00:53:33.310 --> 00:53:35.200
I still don't get
it from movies.

00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:37.320
I'm curious how you
think that will change,

00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:39.050
and what the exciting
opportunities are

00:53:39.050 --> 00:53:39.960
going forward.

00:53:39.960 --> 00:53:42.200
So you've got image
and sort of animation

00:53:42.200 --> 00:53:44.620
and CGI mixed with
physical rides.

00:53:44.620 --> 00:53:49.290
Are there areas you find
particularly exciting?

00:53:49.290 --> 00:53:53.120
BOB GURR: Yeah, this march of
storytelling and technology,

00:53:53.120 --> 00:53:56.980
it's just constantly
grinding along.

00:53:56.980 --> 00:53:59.230
I kind of feel sorry
for folks today,

00:53:59.230 --> 00:54:02.440
because you have this
logarithmic curve,

00:54:02.440 --> 00:54:03.340
and it's climbing up.

00:54:03.340 --> 00:54:06.310
It's so steep that
back in those days,

00:54:06.310 --> 00:54:08.720
the curve was way down here,
and in not much effort,

00:54:08.720 --> 00:54:10.160
you got really far.

00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:13.420
Today, as you know, in
just about every industry,

00:54:13.420 --> 00:54:14.840
you've got a curve like this.

00:54:14.840 --> 00:54:19.260
It takes so much effort to
hardly make any advance in it.

00:54:19.260 --> 00:54:22.605
But it's relentless, it's
slow, and it keeps grinding.

00:54:22.605 --> 00:54:24.730
An example of this is what
I was telling you about.

00:54:24.730 --> 00:54:30.060
The Voyage to the Iron
Reef is a small company

00:54:30.060 --> 00:54:32.080
with some very good
thinkers figuring out

00:54:32.080 --> 00:54:34.660
a better way to do a CGI.

00:54:34.660 --> 00:54:38.410
And do it so fast that
you shoot something,

00:54:38.410 --> 00:54:40.050
and in about a
quarter of a second,

00:54:40.050 --> 00:54:42.420
the whole thing
blows up in pieces.

00:54:42.420 --> 00:54:44.785
Not a thing where a
little thing falls over

00:54:44.785 --> 00:54:46.070
like a shooting gallery.

00:54:46.070 --> 00:54:48.960
When I see people that do
that-- and it's a tiny company.

00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:52.620
It's only a handful of people.

00:54:52.620 --> 00:54:55.190
Those kind of people are
scattered everywhere.

00:54:55.190 --> 00:54:57.230
And sometimes a company
will see that they

00:54:57.230 --> 00:55:00.330
can take a piece of this and a
piece of that, and with an idea

00:55:00.330 --> 00:55:02.490
here and a story
writer there, and they

00:55:02.490 --> 00:55:06.150
can make something out of it
that really is mind blowing.

00:55:06.150 --> 00:55:08.430
But there's no way
to forecast it,

00:55:08.430 --> 00:55:10.240
and it gets very,
very expensive.

00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:14.320
Except today, some people are
doing this very inexpensively,

00:55:14.320 --> 00:55:15.847
and they're doing
a very good job.

00:55:15.847 --> 00:55:16.680
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:55:20.280 --> 00:55:23.070
AUDIENCE: So you've
mentioned how you're now

00:55:23.070 --> 00:55:25.380
part of the awards
committee and you go around

00:55:25.380 --> 00:55:27.860
to all of these new theme
parks who are bringing out

00:55:27.860 --> 00:55:29.750
new technologies.

00:55:29.750 --> 00:55:32.710
How And you mentioned
also the blaster rides

00:55:32.710 --> 00:55:35.890
and stuff that-- shooter
rides that are coming along.

00:55:35.890 --> 00:55:39.250
How do you feel about the
way our rides are changing,

00:55:39.250 --> 00:55:42.130
and the way that they're
changing the way we experience

00:55:42.130 --> 00:55:42.770
these rides?

00:55:42.770 --> 00:55:45.370
And do you think there's
anything about that that

00:55:45.370 --> 00:55:46.910
won't change moving forward?

00:55:46.910 --> 00:55:49.960
Or anything particularly
interesting that will change?

00:55:49.960 --> 00:55:51.690
BOB GURR: Oh, I
love this question.

00:55:51.690 --> 00:55:54.040
I get this a lot.

00:55:54.040 --> 00:55:57.760
It has to do with
attention span.

00:55:57.760 --> 00:56:02.030
50 years ago, people would
do any kind of an activity,

00:56:02.030 --> 00:56:04.740
and it would be kind of
simple, kind of slow.

00:56:04.740 --> 00:56:07.710
They would spend quite a
few minutes at something.

00:56:07.710 --> 00:56:13.080
The attention span of
some people I think

00:56:13.080 --> 00:56:16.120
is right around 20 seconds.

00:56:16.120 --> 00:56:17.630
You know what I'm talking about.

00:56:17.630 --> 00:56:19.520
You can be bored
in about 20 seconds

00:56:19.520 --> 00:56:21.620
if something is not
really interesting.

00:56:21.620 --> 00:56:25.390
The interesting thing
about that is the stuff

00:56:25.390 --> 00:56:28.760
that we spend such
a short time at

00:56:28.760 --> 00:56:33.000
are usually mind blowing
technical achievements.

00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:36.520
And that goes back to this curve
that I was trying to describe.

00:56:36.520 --> 00:56:39.440
It's like, how much
more do we have

00:56:39.440 --> 00:56:44.180
to do in the face of people
who maybe in 10 years,

00:56:44.180 --> 00:56:48.330
they'll be down to 15
seconds before they're bored?

00:56:48.330 --> 00:56:50.460
That really impacts
storytelling,

00:56:50.460 --> 00:56:55.860
because you can't get people
to sit down and savor a story,

00:56:55.860 --> 00:56:58.300
savor all the
subtleties of something.

00:56:58.300 --> 00:57:00.540
Everything is going
just like that.

00:57:00.540 --> 00:57:01.800
We call it multitasking.

00:57:01.800 --> 00:57:04.470
If you stop and think
about what multitasking is,

00:57:04.470 --> 00:57:06.120
you're simply using
the same brain

00:57:06.120 --> 00:57:08.950
doing one thing, one at a
time, but every five seconds

00:57:08.950 --> 00:57:10.200
it's going to another thing.

00:57:10.200 --> 00:57:12.320
And you're not doing it
all at once, you know.

00:57:12.320 --> 00:57:15.440
You're just processing
this, this, and this

00:57:15.440 --> 00:57:17.690
in some kind of a sequence.

00:57:17.690 --> 00:57:21.310
The fact that so many people
are used to doing this now-- you

00:57:21.310 --> 00:57:22.280
go on any street.

00:57:22.280 --> 00:57:23.120
There's a crosswalk.

00:57:23.120 --> 00:57:24.720
There's cars coming.

00:57:24.720 --> 00:57:27.870
The person's going
across the street.

00:57:27.870 --> 00:57:31.490
They've got a device,
stuff stuck in their ears.

00:57:31.490 --> 00:57:33.610
They are not looking
in any direction.

00:57:33.610 --> 00:57:35.530
They're assuming a
painted white line

00:57:35.530 --> 00:57:37.194
will allow them
not to be killed.

00:57:37.194 --> 00:57:39.050
[LAUGHTER]

00:57:39.050 --> 00:57:43.350
They are so tightly woven
into their electronic world

00:57:43.350 --> 00:57:47.410
that they don't even
see a world around them.

00:57:47.410 --> 00:57:49.170
You follow what
I'm talking about?

00:57:49.170 --> 00:57:50.850
You've got products
and services here

00:57:50.850 --> 00:57:53.860
that do a little bit of that,
so I'm not really knocking that.

00:57:53.860 --> 00:57:54.360
But--

00:57:54.360 --> 00:57:55.250
[LAUGHTER]

00:57:55.250 --> 00:57:57.336
You've got to
remember, a theme park,

00:57:57.336 --> 00:57:58.710
those are the
customers that come

00:57:58.710 --> 00:58:03.340
in there with that type of life
and that type of expectation.

00:58:03.340 --> 00:58:07.540
What do you do to get
their attention where

00:58:07.540 --> 00:58:09.770
they'll savor the whole idea?

00:58:09.770 --> 00:58:13.810
And I've watched
50 years of this,

00:58:13.810 --> 00:58:16.500
and it's just a steady trend.

00:58:16.500 --> 00:58:19.260
Complicated question,
complicated answer.

00:58:19.260 --> 00:58:20.612
So I apologize.

00:58:20.612 --> 00:58:21.445
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:58:24.430 --> 00:58:27.670
AUDIENCE: I wanted to build
on that question a little bit.

00:58:27.670 --> 00:58:30.510
Google started on the web
and we were born to the web,

00:58:30.510 --> 00:58:32.869
and the way we
connected with our users

00:58:32.869 --> 00:58:33.910
was through the internet.

00:58:33.910 --> 00:58:37.360
But increasingly, Google
is expanding what we do

00:58:37.360 --> 00:58:39.715
or getting more into
making devices and hardware

00:58:39.715 --> 00:58:41.730
and computers, phones.

00:58:41.730 --> 00:58:44.785
And so the place where
we reach our customers

00:58:44.785 --> 00:58:45.660
isn't always the web.

00:58:45.660 --> 00:58:51.122
Sometimes it's a real, physical
place, like a retail store.

00:58:51.122 --> 00:58:53.580
Well, the internet wasn't around
when Disneyland and Disney

00:58:53.580 --> 00:58:55.720
World were built. And I
imagine, had Walt been around,

00:58:55.720 --> 00:58:57.230
he would have been
fascinated by it.

00:58:57.230 --> 00:58:59.330
So I guess my
question to you is,

00:58:59.330 --> 00:59:03.740
if you were to build a physical
space to bring the web to life

00:59:03.740 --> 00:59:07.630
in a real, tangible place,
what would it look like to you?

00:59:07.630 --> 00:59:10.400
If that was your job?

00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:14.120
BOB GURR: Man, you-- I knew
this place had brilliant people.

00:59:14.120 --> 00:59:16.690
Man, these are very
heady questions.

00:59:16.690 --> 00:59:21.520
You're getting into
a lot of theory,

00:59:21.520 --> 00:59:26.550
a lot of social awareness
of the methodologies

00:59:26.550 --> 00:59:28.470
that people use in their lives.

00:59:28.470 --> 00:59:31.360
It's a very, very complex mix.

00:59:31.360 --> 00:59:35.160
And your trying to approach
that mix with your products

00:59:35.160 --> 00:59:37.250
and your services.

00:59:37.250 --> 00:59:39.380
I really feel for
the anguish you

00:59:39.380 --> 00:59:42.450
must go through trying to
figure out, what do we do,

00:59:42.450 --> 00:59:44.599
and how do we really
implement this?

00:59:44.599 --> 00:59:47.140
Because number one, you're going
to make some money doing it,

00:59:47.140 --> 00:59:50.950
or you're going to just astound
the world if the thing actually

00:59:50.950 --> 00:59:54.570
works, which you've
already done.

00:59:54.570 --> 00:59:56.030
I don't know how
in the world you

00:59:56.030 --> 00:59:58.660
dive into the
psychology of changing

00:59:58.660 --> 01:00:03.270
minds over a long period of
time to know just how to specify

01:00:03.270 --> 01:00:06.630
the course you want to take.

01:00:06.630 --> 01:00:09.120
I'm glad I did all my
design so long ago.

01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:10.358
It was a lot easier.

01:00:10.358 --> 01:00:12.007
[LAUGH]

01:00:12.007 --> 01:00:12.840
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:14.250
BOB GURR: All right.

01:00:14.250 --> 01:00:15.920
Ooh, are we running-- ooh, yeah.

01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:16.380
MALE SPEAKER: Last question.

01:00:16.380 --> 01:00:16.930
BOB GURR: OK.

01:00:16.930 --> 01:00:17.755
You're the last question.

01:00:17.755 --> 01:00:19.004
AUDIENCE: So it's sort of two.

01:00:19.004 --> 01:00:22.230
But the first one is, so
I love the Jungle Cruise.

01:00:22.230 --> 01:00:23.660
That's a nice old ride.

01:00:23.660 --> 01:00:24.410
Love taking it.

01:00:24.410 --> 01:00:25.650
Love the humor.

01:00:25.650 --> 01:00:29.320
Can you convince me that I
shouldn't feel about It's

01:00:29.320 --> 01:00:30.870
a Small World like I do?

01:00:30.870 --> 01:00:31.575
[LAUGHTER]

01:00:31.575 --> 01:00:35.068
What is supposed to be the
magic with It's a Small World?

01:00:35.068 --> 01:00:38.344
[LAUGHTER]

01:00:39.750 --> 01:00:43.076
BOB GURR: Other than the
music, Richard Sherman who

01:00:43.076 --> 01:00:44.700
wrote it is a very
good friend of mine,

01:00:44.700 --> 01:00:46.420
and he always opens
his speeches with,

01:00:46.420 --> 01:00:48.850
if you love it or
hate it, I'm the guy.

01:00:48.850 --> 01:00:50.850
You know.

01:00:50.850 --> 01:00:53.560
The whole concept-- that
was a UNICEF concept.

01:00:53.560 --> 01:00:56.180
It came to us about
10 and a half months

01:00:56.180 --> 01:00:57.367
before the opening date.

01:00:57.367 --> 01:00:57.950
It was a show.

01:00:57.950 --> 01:00:59.670
We got into it very, very late.

01:00:59.670 --> 01:01:01.630
The concept was simple.

01:01:01.630 --> 01:01:04.590
The whole world, if
they thought about it,

01:01:04.590 --> 01:01:09.400
could connect themselves in
such a normal, peaceful, quiet

01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:12.720
manner expressed as children.

01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:16.770
That's why we chose one
size head, one size face.

01:01:16.770 --> 01:01:18.270
Because we were
running out of time.

01:01:18.270 --> 01:01:20.150
We couldn't do it any other way.

01:01:20.150 --> 01:01:24.260
And we had only the differences
of singing and clothing,

01:01:24.260 --> 01:01:26.410
but the same face.

01:01:26.410 --> 01:01:29.980
The whole world
is like the same.

01:01:29.980 --> 01:01:30.730
That was the idea.

01:01:30.730 --> 01:01:31.688
That was the rationale.

01:01:31.688 --> 01:01:33.680
Of course, the world
doesn't always turn out

01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:35.030
the way you want to do that.

01:01:35.030 --> 01:01:37.790
But some people will
go to the Small World

01:01:37.790 --> 01:01:41.444
over and over and over,
and withstand that song--

01:01:41.444 --> 01:01:43.140
[LAUGHTER]

01:01:43.140 --> 01:01:47.250
Because there's something--
there's a psychological thing

01:01:47.250 --> 01:01:51.200
that you pick up, and you don't
know you're picking it up.

01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:54.400
It's been discussed a lot by
a lot of people over time.

01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:57.090
Interesting that you
would ask that question.

01:01:57.090 --> 01:02:01.040
Because in a way, that is
a reverse of the changes

01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:02.562
we see with the
technological way

01:02:02.562 --> 01:02:04.520
people want to be
entertained and the attention

01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:07.830
span getting tighter and tighter
and tighter, and the fact

01:02:07.830 --> 01:02:10.070
that you can sit in
that boat, and it's just

01:02:10.070 --> 01:02:11.266
a bunch of kids singing.

01:02:11.266 --> 01:02:12.875
[LAUGH]

01:02:12.875 --> 01:02:14.250
AUDIENCE: And the
second question

01:02:14.250 --> 01:02:17.200
I had-- and it's
quick, I'm sure-- was

01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:21.350
there sort of a status
symbol attached to what

01:02:21.350 --> 01:02:23.340
level of ride your thing got?

01:02:23.340 --> 01:02:26.619
Like, your firetruck
would be an A ticket ride.

01:02:26.619 --> 01:02:28.160
And, you know, a
roller coaster would

01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:31.300
be a D. Was there any sort of
status associated with which

01:02:31.300 --> 01:02:33.230
projects you were working on?

01:02:33.230 --> 01:02:36.630
BOB GURR: No, because this was
a natural range that you wanted

01:02:36.630 --> 01:02:41.500
to do, because you're going to
have A, B, C, D, E. One time

01:02:41.500 --> 01:02:45.270
we used tickets like that,
and then it was just,

01:02:45.270 --> 01:02:46.780
everything's the same.

01:02:46.780 --> 01:02:48.480
So as you know,
in the vernacular,

01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:50.810
E ticket is described
by everybody,

01:02:50.810 --> 01:02:52.460
because you know
what that meant.

01:02:52.460 --> 01:02:55.210
That's the big one, and that.

01:02:55.210 --> 01:02:57.150
So we don't really
pay much attention

01:02:57.150 --> 01:02:58.450
to the status of things.

01:02:58.450 --> 01:03:01.860
Because you need the little
area development things,

01:03:01.860 --> 01:03:03.330
you need the little
subtle things

01:03:03.330 --> 01:03:07.370
that are quiet to match
the big, rowdy stuff.

01:03:07.370 --> 01:03:09.690
So we still look
at it as somebody

01:03:09.690 --> 01:03:11.365
says an A, somebody
says an E, we

01:03:11.365 --> 01:03:12.870
know exactly what that means.

01:03:12.870 --> 01:03:16.614
Because it's the range of
things that guests would enjoy.

01:03:16.614 --> 01:03:17.280
AUDIENCE: Great.

01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:17.840
Thank you.

01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:18.440
BOB GURR: OK.

01:03:18.440 --> 01:03:19.040
All right.

01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:20.082
[APPLAUSE]

01:03:20.082 --> 01:03:22.040
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you
so much for being here.

01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:25.690
