00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:04.133
NARRATOR: It's the Sam Simon and
its crew that are confronting

00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:06.367
the issues here head on.

00:00:06.367 --> 00:00:09.266
Of course, their day
was a bit frustrating

00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:12.800
when you see this overwhelming
amount of nets that's out

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.667
there, that there's
till the fishermen

00:00:14.667 --> 00:00:18.233
going out and laying more nets.

00:00:18.233 --> 00:00:20.100
NARRATOR: The Sam
Simon's primary weapon

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.100
in their fight
against these gillnets

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.533
is what they call a phantom ray.

00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:29.000
The ray is set for
seven, eight meters.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.433
NARRATOR: The ray is dropped
into the water at a set depth.

00:00:31.433 --> 00:00:34.367
It drags a grappling
hook along the sea floor.

00:00:34.367 --> 00:00:37.333
When the hook catches a
net, a thin breaker line

00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:39.233
attached to the ship snaps.

00:00:39.233 --> 00:00:43.834
This releases the ray and marks
the net's location with a buoy.

00:00:43.834 --> 00:00:46.667
MAN (ON RADIO): Sam Simon,
Sam Simon, this is Viking.

00:00:46.667 --> 00:00:50.934
I can confirm for the net.

00:00:50.934 --> 00:00:53.200
I reckon there's a couple
of totoaba in the water there.

00:00:57.066 --> 00:01:00.433
There must be six, seven
carcasses of totoaba

00:01:00.433 --> 00:01:03.967
floating by us right now.

00:01:03.967 --> 00:01:05.734
I guess the deal
is that they cut

00:01:05.734 --> 00:01:07.900
the bladders out as
quick as possible

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.834
and throw the rest in the sea.

00:01:10.834 --> 00:01:12.934
Now we're going
to launch the boat

00:01:12.934 --> 00:01:16.533
and go find out whether it is
a totoaba net, or a long line,

00:01:16.533 --> 00:01:18.734
or any illegal fishing gear
that is in these waters.

00:01:18.734 --> 00:01:19.934
And then we're going
to retrieve it.

00:01:19.934 --> 00:01:21.000
- Can I come with you?
- Of course.

00:01:24.633 --> 00:01:27.066
The sea shepherd team
have managed to scoop

00:01:27.066 --> 00:01:29.800
up the remnants of that net.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.233
And we're on our way to
find out what's in it.

00:01:35.133 --> 00:01:37.734
Surrounded by dead
carcasses of totoaba

00:01:37.734 --> 00:01:42.266
that have been mutilated,
its twin bladders taken out.

00:01:42.266 --> 00:01:44.300
They're everywhere.

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.200
PIA KLEMP: One, two.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.433
Wow, that's tough, huh?

00:01:47.433 --> 00:01:48.767
PIA KLEMP: Yeah, one, two.

00:01:48.767 --> 00:01:50.967
NARRATOR: But the totoaba
are far from the only victims

00:01:50.967 --> 00:01:52.367
of these nets.

00:01:52.367 --> 00:01:54.433
And the nature of the sea, there
could be anything in this net.

00:01:54.433 --> 00:01:57.467
We have been finding
everything from sea lions

00:01:57.467 --> 00:02:02.000
to dolphins to
hammerhead sharks.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.333
Not too long ago,
we saw a whale.

00:02:03.333 --> 00:02:07.300
And it was almost
like an hourglass

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.567
for how much the
net was strangling

00:02:10.567 --> 00:02:12.100
the whale like halfway through.

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.367
So it really is a whole load
of species that are caught up

00:02:15.367 --> 00:02:17.433
in this trade for the totoaba.

00:02:17.433 --> 00:02:18.700
Right?

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.367
The net doesn't
really distinguish

00:02:20.367 --> 00:02:21.533
who it's going to catch.

00:02:21.533 --> 00:02:27.467
So whichever animal swims
through these waters

00:02:27.467 --> 00:02:29.600
is sentenced to death.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.233
Oh, here comes the shark.

00:02:31.233 --> 00:02:33.500
PIA KLEMP: Oh, no.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:34.667
GIACOMO GIORGI:
Oh, the hammerhead.

00:02:34.667 --> 00:02:36.834
Oh, Chris, it
feels pretty soft.

00:02:36.834 --> 00:02:38.500
GIACOMO GIORGI:
Is it still alive?

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:39.433
PIA KLEMP: I don't think so.

00:02:39.433 --> 00:02:40.734
Come here, baby.

00:02:43.667 --> 00:02:47.867
We are wiping out sharks
from our oceans for their fins.

00:02:47.867 --> 00:02:49.800
In Asia, they eat
shark fin soup.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.700
And what happens is that
a lot of fishing vessels

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.367
catch a shark, cut
their fin, and then

00:02:55.367 --> 00:02:57.133
throw back their bodies.

00:02:57.133 --> 00:03:01.367
And finding a dead shark, a
dead hammerhead in this net

00:03:01.367 --> 00:03:04.834
is really heartbreaking.

00:03:04.834 --> 00:03:06.133
NARRATOR: But the
heartbreak here isn't

00:03:06.133 --> 00:03:08.800
reserved for marine life alone.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.967
As the Sam Simon
continues its mission

00:03:10.967 --> 00:03:14.867
to remove illegal gillnets, the
nearby fishing towns suffocate.

00:03:14.867 --> 00:03:17.233
