00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.520
Today, we've got a fun experiment
for you guys brought to us by

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.250
YouTube user Mohamed Fazid,

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:07.430
who wants to know if we can
make shoes out of silicone,

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:09.320
and how comfortable they are.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.300
[Captions by Judy V. at Y Translator]
[Music]

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:16.700
[Music]

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.060
Here's the basic idea:

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.620
Using one batch of proto-putty,

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.360
I'll make the soles of my shoes.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.440
I'll then wrap my feet
in socks and plastic wrap,

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.420
and I'll sculpt the rest
of the shoes around my own feet.

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.040
To get the right size
and shape for the soles,

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.700
I'm going to trace a shoe
that I know already fits.

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.700
That'll give me the
soles of my two shoes,

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:35.740
so let's start mixing up some proto-putty.

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:51.460
[Music]

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.019
That is one entire tubes worth
of silicone right there.

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.720
See, for the soles of the shoes,

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.580
I think we'll go for red.

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:04.960
[Music]

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.040
I'm not sure if I've ever mixed
up a batch of proto-putty

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.380
that used an entire tube before,

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.520
and of course, once I get 
started on the cornstarch,

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.480
it's going to get very messy.

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:14.640
It smells great.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:25.000
[Music]

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:26.920
It's so strong.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.520
Save yourself, Mark.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:29.960
Run while there's still time.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.800
Sometimes, the fumes from the
silicone are a little overwhelming.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:37.980
This is one of those times.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.700
The fumes that come off of
the silicone are acetic acid,

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.400
which is basically the main
component in vinegar.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.260
So, if you really really
love salt and vinegar chips,

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.730
this, this is going to be your jam.

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:54.020
You will love this.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.420
If you really love them a lot.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:11.060
[Music]

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.040
Perfectly approximated
the color of a pencil eraser.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.079
[Music]

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:19.159
The soles of the shoes are made.

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:21.329
Now, I'm going to
put on some long socks,

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:22.879
wrap my feet in plastic wrap,

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:25.549
and try and sculpt
the shoes around my feet

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:28.769
as I keep them right on the soles.

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:30.489
To do this, I'm going
to have to be somewhere

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:32.680
where I can put
my feet on the table,

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.240
and work at the table.

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.730
So, I think I'll mix up a new batch,

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.120
and then sit on the workbench

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.340
as I try and sculpt it
around my own foot.

00:02:39.340 --> 00:03:24.540
[Music]

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.380
All right. I've been sculpting
this shoe onto my foot,

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.620
and it's uh, looking more
like a slipper than a shoe.

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.380
But as long as it holds
itself on while I walk,

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.620
I'll call that functional.

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.000
It's very stylish.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.629
I think this is really going
to catch on a lot of places

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:43.450
as something that
a lot of people like to wear.

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:44.860
Crocs had their heyday,

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.239
silicone rubber shoes are coming up next.

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:49.919
Okay, my foot's been
in here for a good while.

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:51.739
I think the putty has cured enough

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:53.529
that I can try and take 
my foot out now.

00:03:53.529 --> 00:03:57.100
Hopefully, it hasn't bonded
too much to the plastic wrap.

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.920
Oh, a little.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:01.280
Not bad.

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.469
Now, there are a couple of places

00:04:03.469 --> 00:04:06.480
where it didn't stick super well
to the sole of the shoe,

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.180
and in those spots were
gonna just take some caulking,

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.980
run a bead,

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.260
and use it as a glue
to hold it all together.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.240
Once it's all glued together,
we can see how well I can walk in it.

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:16.460
Time for the other foot.

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:19.660
[Music]

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.540
That is shoe number two.

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:24.800
Sculpted and just waiting to cure.

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.820
Shoe?

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.200
Slipper?

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.400
You know, something like that.

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.020
All right,
let's try and pop this shoe off.

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.280
[Music]

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:35.290
Same thing on this one.

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:37.820
Some of the spots aren't
attached really well.

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:41.360
In fact, this one right in the middle
isn't attached very well on the sides,

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.580
but we are going to mix up
a batch of some silicone

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.381
with a little bit
of water mixed into it,

00:04:46.381 --> 00:04:50.320
and just use that as a glue
to secure everything to itself.

00:04:50.320 --> 00:05:02.240
[Music]

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.160
After gluing the soles
to the sides of the shoes,

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:06.810
I wanted to make sure everything
was really well set and cured,

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:08.670
so I let them sit overnight,

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:10.460
and now I think
we're ready to test these out.

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.120
First, I'm going to use
some scissors and knife

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.360
to trim off some of the extra edges.

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:21.660
[Music]

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.080
It does seem pretty well trimmed.

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.150
I do want to get rid of just
the last remaining bits of cornstarch

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:27.170
that are obviously on these,

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:28.800
so, I'm just going
to run them under water.

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.040
At this point, these shoes
should be very waterproof.

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:35.420
So, I'm not really
worried about ruining them.

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:45.880
[Music]

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:47.930
Well, these are trimmed,
washed, and dried,

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:49.120
and now, a moment of truth,

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.600
let's see how they work on my feet.

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:56.360
[Music]

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.560
It's uh, it's form-fitting.

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:01.280
It fits to my foot without
a lot of space in there.

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.740
On the plus side,
that means it stays on well enough.

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:22.810
[Music]

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:26.200
I can certainly feel the shapes
of the lava rocks under my feet,

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:27.340
but it's not uncomfortable.

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:29.820
It's just kind of like
a bumpy foot massage.

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:34.920
[Music]

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:36.100
Well, they may be ugly,

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:38.480
but I would say
that these are functional.

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:42.200
These shoes are made out of
silicone, cornstarch, and food coloring,

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:42.920
and you know what?

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:44.480
They held up pretty well.

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:46.340
Of course, they are a little bit heavy,

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:48.500
and I don't know how
long the soles would last.

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:50.680
So far, I've only put them
to a test for about ten minutes.

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:52.160
But they did hold up to that.

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:53.220
They protect your feet.

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:56.400
They stay on pretty well,
and they're very custom sizable.

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:58.020
It would probably take me several tries

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:00.370
before I got something that
actually started to look stylish,

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:03.980
but for our first try, I would say 
these slippers aren't too bad.

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:05.300
One downside that you saw

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:08.260
is that because the
soles are so very smooth,

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.540
they really don't have
almost any traction.

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:13.720
When there's water in the floor,
the shoes gotten very slippery,

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:15.980
and that's what happens when you have
a smooth surface on a wet surface.

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:18.480
Thank you to YouTube user
Mohamed Fazid for your idea

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:20.580
to try out making silicone shoes.

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:21.780
Check your YouTube inbox.

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:23.350
We're sending you 25 bucks.

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:25.240
And they are somewhat comfortable,

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:26.540
not extremely comfortable.

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:29.400
A good pair of sneakers is definitely
going to be better than these.

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:32.220
But if I were walking somewhere
with sharp or rough surfaces,

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:33.860
I'd rather have these than be barefoot.

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:37.080
Guys, we've got more for you to see.

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:39.860

Go check that out!

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:42.680
The box at the bottom
will show you what YouTube thinks

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:43.720
you need to be watching now,

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:45.780
and this bomb here in the middle
will subscribe you to the channel,

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:46.920
so you never miss a video.

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:48.180
Don't forget to ring that bell,

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:49.000
and we will see you in the next one.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:49.680
Talk to you then.
