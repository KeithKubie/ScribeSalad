00:00:09.126 --> 00:00:12.126
&gt;&gt;We found a dead mouse.

00:00:12.126 --> 00:00:13.676
&gt;&gt;Did anybody get a picture?

00:00:13.676 --> 00:00:14.566
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Four times a year,

00:00:14.566 --> 00:00:18.266
the Glacial Ridge Wildlife
Refuge becomes a living classroom

00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:21.726
for students from J.A.
Hughes Elementary School

00:00:21.726 --> 00:00:23.526
in Red Lake Falls, Minnesota.

00:00:23.526 --> 00:00:24.646
&gt;&gt;Boy: Yeah, it's a burnt frog.

00:00:25.176 --> 00:00:26.916
&gt;&gt;Woman: Let me see.

00:00:26.916 --> 00:00:28.036
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Originally
prairie wetlands,

00:00:28.416 --> 00:00:31.706
this 35,000-acre parcel
once hosted hundreds

00:00:31.706 --> 00:00:34.096
of unique plant and animal species.

00:00:34.236 --> 00:00:37.586
&gt;&gt;Man: It looks way
different, doesn't it?

00:00:37.646 --> 00:00:37.746
&gt;&gt;All: Yeah.

00:00:37.746 --> 00:00:39.436
&gt;&gt;Narrator: But decades
of crop production

00:00:39.436 --> 00:00:43.456
and cattle grazing have eliminated
much of the biodiversity here.

00:00:43.456 --> 00:00:44.716
&gt;&gt;Man: And what do you
think it's going to look

00:00:44.716 --> 00:00:46.896
like in the spring when we come out?

00:00:47.086 --> 00:00:48.886
&gt;&gt;Huge grasses, very tall.

00:00:49.156 --> 00:00:52.906
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In 2004, The Nature
Conservancy bought some of the land,

00:00:53.356 --> 00:00:54.986
turning it into the largest prairie

00:00:54.986 --> 00:00:57.596
and wetland restoration
project in U.S. history.

00:00:58.086 --> 00:00:59.246
&gt;&gt;When you get to the water!

00:00:59.286 --> 00:01:02.006
&gt;&gt;Narrator: And they invited the
school to help them study the area.

00:01:02.236 --> 00:01:03.866
&gt;&gt;17 meters.

00:01:04.016 --> 00:01:07.316
&gt;&gt;Mike: We're basically
studying how a prairie emerges,

00:01:07.316 --> 00:01:12.906
so we're taking temperatures,
water, air, pH readings,

00:01:12.956 --> 00:01:13.886
just a whole lot of data.

00:01:14.236 --> 00:01:16.166
&gt;&gt;Woman: We know the
road is to the north.

00:01:16.166 --> 00:01:17.846
What direction is the
wind coming from?

00:01:18.216 --> 00:01:20.516
&gt;&gt;South, that way.

00:01:20.596 --> 00:01:23.056
&gt;&gt;Together: North, South, East.

00:01:23.106 --> 00:01:25.046
&gt;&gt;Woman: So the wind
is coming from the...

00:01:25.446 --> 00:01:26.746
&gt;&gt;All: East.

00:01:27.396 --> 00:01:30.346
&gt;&gt;Deberah: We had access to
this wonderful learning site,

00:01:30.546 --> 00:01:34.416
and we wanted to be able
to use it to its fullest.

00:01:34.516 --> 00:01:37.976
And we had very little,
very little technology.

00:01:38.446 --> 00:01:40.626
And what we had was very outdated.

00:01:40.846 --> 00:01:41.916
&gt;&gt;Deberah: Face it to the wind.

00:01:42.216 --> 00:01:45.186
&gt;&gt;Narrator: With a technology grant,
they got portable computers...

00:01:45.226 --> 00:01:46.566
&gt;&gt;Mike: Try right now
and see how to do it.

00:01:47.016 --> 00:01:48.986
&gt;&gt;Narrator: ...temperature
probes and other devices

00:01:48.986 --> 00:01:51.676
that improved the quality
of their field data.

00:01:51.676 --> 00:01:54.986
&gt;&gt;Ryan: We use the computer to
take water and air temperature,

00:01:55.956 --> 00:02:00.236
and then some people have
cameras just to help us

00:02:00.236 --> 00:02:03.026
in case our pictures get
deleted on the paint cans.

00:02:03.326 --> 00:02:05.856
&gt;&gt;We're collecting
the air temperature

00:02:06.116 --> 00:02:07.996
for Celsius and Fahrenheit.

00:02:08.116 --> 00:02:09.346
&gt;&gt;Mike: Are you still
reading Celsius?

00:02:09.706 --> 00:02:09.926
&gt;&gt;Yep.

00:02:10.086 --> 00:02:11.006
&gt;&gt;Mike: Okay, why don't you switch?

00:02:11.236 --> 00:02:13.286
&gt;&gt;Let's switch it.

00:02:13.646 --> 00:02:14.926
&gt;&gt;Mike: Our reading
for Fahrenheit is what?

00:02:15.356 --> 00:02:17.236
&gt;&gt;43.8.

00:02:17.426 --> 00:02:18.486
&gt;&gt;Mike: Okay, 43.8.

00:02:18.586 --> 00:02:19.526
Do we have that documented?

00:02:20.246 --> 00:02:22.736
&gt;&gt;Deberah: Technology out at
Glacial Ridge adds accuracy.

00:02:22.736 --> 00:02:27.466
Before, we were using manual
thermometers and our data would be

00:02:27.466 --> 00:02:31.246
so varied, whereas now when
we're using temp probes,

00:02:31.496 --> 00:02:33.156
it's on and we know it's on.

00:02:33.156 --> 00:02:36.156
We don't have to worry about
the data being inaccurate.

00:02:36.156 --> 00:02:38.276
&gt;&gt;Write down 6.57.

00:02:38.976 --> 00:02:43.536
&gt;&gt;No, wasn't it six seven?

00:02:43.586 --> 00:02:44.126
Celsius.

00:02:44.126 --> 00:02:46.446
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Each student is
responsible for searching out

00:02:46.446 --> 00:02:50.066
and becoming an expert on a few
specific plants and animals.

00:02:50.446 --> 00:02:56.596
&gt;&gt;Zack: We all have certain
organisms that we have to use and see

00:02:56.676 --> 00:03:03.096
to identify their tracks and what
they look like and what they eat

00:03:03.096 --> 00:03:06.186
and what's their habitat
and stuff like that.

00:03:06.916 --> 00:03:10.086
&gt;&gt;Deberah: They know that
they are the go-to person

00:03:10.086 --> 00:03:11.886
for their whole group
on that organism.

00:03:12.176 --> 00:03:14.016
&gt;&gt;Oh, look at them!

00:03:14.016 --> 00:03:16.996
&gt;&gt;Deberah: So when they're
researching their organisms,

00:03:17.666 --> 00:03:19.136
they do it with a purpose.

00:03:19.406 --> 00:03:23.356
They don't want to look silly to
their peers, and so it has meaning.

00:03:23.686 --> 00:03:24.376
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Fourth-, fifth-,

00:03:24.376 --> 00:03:26.886
and sixth-graders visit
the Glacial Ridge together.

00:03:27.276 --> 00:03:30.806
They work in small teams with older
students teaching younger ones how

00:03:30.806 --> 00:03:31.566
to collect the data.

00:03:32.416 --> 00:03:34.326
&gt;&gt;Matthew did our water sample.

00:03:34.876 --> 00:03:37.436
Next, we are going
to look at our plots.

00:03:37.766 --> 00:03:39.136
&gt;&gt;Deberah: The sixth-graders
are the lead,

00:03:39.556 --> 00:03:42.046
and they take that very seriously.

00:03:42.106 --> 00:03:45.446
In fact, one of this year's
fifth-graders, he was so serious,

00:03:45.446 --> 00:03:49.506
and he was telling me so much that
he had found and seen and observed.

00:03:49.856 --> 00:03:51.456
And I said, "Wow, what's going on?"

00:03:51.456 --> 00:03:54.086
And he said, "I had to get serious.

00:03:54.086 --> 00:03:55.426
I'm a leader next year."

00:03:55.426 --> 00:03:57.986
&gt;&gt;Okay, Elidia, you can come
and take your picture now.

00:03:58.406 --> 00:03:59.966
&gt;&gt;Deberah: You know, every
time we go out there,

00:04:00.366 --> 00:04:02.416
we come back with more questions.

00:04:02.746 --> 00:04:05.296
&gt;&gt;Mike: In nature, how
do the fires start?

00:04:05.796 --> 00:04:06.066
Anybody?

00:04:07.016 --> 00:04:07.496
&gt;&gt;All: Lightning.

00:04:08.976 --> 00:04:09.476
&gt;&gt;Mike: Very good.

00:04:09.546 --> 00:04:13.006
Now, do we know if we're absolutely
right or wrong on these answers?

00:04:13.206 --> 00:04:14.026
&gt;&gt;All: No.

00:04:14.026 --> 00:04:14.996
&gt;&gt;Mike: How could we find out?

00:04:15.296 --> 00:04:15.606
&gt;&gt;Web search.

00:04:15.606 --> 00:04:15.956
&gt;&gt;Internet.

00:04:16.726 --> 00:04:18.016
&gt;&gt;Mike: Websites, Internet.

00:04:18.426 --> 00:04:21.376
Do we have some sources
that are really close to us

00:04:21.506 --> 00:04:23.986
that we could contact,
maybe using an e-mail?

00:04:24.776 --> 00:04:27.086
&gt;&gt;The Glacial Ridge people.

00:04:27.176 --> 00:04:28.596
&gt;&gt;Mike: Glacial Ridge people, right.

00:04:28.836 --> 00:04:32.326
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Back in the classroom,
students discuss their findings

00:04:32.586 --> 00:04:35.036
and write a report that
is shared with scientists

00:04:35.036 --> 00:04:36.386
from The Nature Conservancy.

00:04:36.466 --> 00:04:38.036
&gt;&gt;Deberah: So we can
say the temperature--

00:04:38.036 --> 00:04:40.806
&gt;&gt;6.2 to 7.5.

00:04:40.876 --> 00:04:41.546
&gt;&gt;No, to 8.

00:04:42.426 --> 00:04:44.586
&gt;&gt;Narrator: With their
tablets connected to the Web,

00:04:44.876 --> 00:04:47.986
students can access the
latest scientific information

00:04:48.226 --> 00:04:50.786
and participate in global projects.

00:04:50.786 --> 00:04:53.216
&gt;&gt;Deberah: I don't use
a science textbook.

00:04:53.606 --> 00:04:59.046
With sites like Science NetLinks
and NASA's educational modules

00:04:59.046 --> 00:05:03.386
and Journey North and
JASON, we have access

00:05:03.386 --> 00:05:08.036
to standard-based-caliber lessons
that use best-practice methods.

00:05:08.386 --> 00:05:09.786
If we get a science textbook,

00:05:09.786 --> 00:05:11.836
it's outdated by the
time we bring it home.

00:05:12.426 --> 00:05:16.786
So this stuff is always current, and
it's usually Internet-interactive.

00:05:17.426 --> 00:05:21.576
It's got links to all
over, and they learn a lot.

00:05:21.696 --> 00:05:23.746
&gt;&gt;Chris: We brought our
global-positioning system,

00:05:23.746 --> 00:05:27.316
and we're going to go track the
outside perimeter of the flow

00:05:27.316 --> 00:05:28.516
that we measured yesterday.

00:05:28.516 --> 00:05:31.496
&gt;&gt;Deberah: I think that
the use of technology helps

00:05:31.496 --> 00:05:34.916
to create self-learners,
and that's our goal.

00:05:34.916 --> 00:05:37.766
We want them to be
independent lifelong learners,

00:05:37.836 --> 00:05:41.596
and the more they're able to
do that, the more we like it.

00:05:41.596 --> 00:05:43.276
&gt;&gt;Deberah: We need to
talk about predictions.

00:05:43.826 --> 00:05:46.216
What are we going to expect
to see when we go back

00:05:46.296 --> 00:05:50.976
to Glacial Ridge next time?

00:05:51.066 --> 00:05:52.596
