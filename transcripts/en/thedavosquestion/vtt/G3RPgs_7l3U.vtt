00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.299
&gt;&gt; Well, I believe the answer yes.
I believe India can and will become a superpower

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.000
over the next 3 to
4 decades.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.980
What is important is leadership.
Leadership both for the private and public

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:20.010
sectors of the country.
And you know, my perspective obviously is

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.820
one of leadership, running
one of the executive search firms that place

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:30.240
leaders around the globe.
And, um, if you have the right environment

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.059
to foster leadership and
look at this right from the schooling, all

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.910
the way through initial
campus equipment and then training of management

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.660
and leadership through
corporations and the public sector, when you

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.989
have sufficient amount of
leaders, who have the momentum to move forward,

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:50.120
and this country will
definitely then become a superpower.
