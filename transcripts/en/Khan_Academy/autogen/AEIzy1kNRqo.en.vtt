00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.650
 Let's talk about one of the most famous 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.230
 Mathematical theories 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.230
 Pythagorean theory 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.980
 It is about the triangles of the corner menu. 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:28.040
 So, the triangle-based corner is the one that includes 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.000
 90 degree angle 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.340
 So the way I drew it here 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.330
 This is a 90 degree angle 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.320
 If you have not seen an angle before 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.700
 He thought if this side ran from the left 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.600
 To the right, the last extends from top to bottom 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.970
 They are perpendicular, meaning that the corner is confined 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.110
 Between them is equal to 90 degrees "angle list". 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.990
 The Pythagorean theory tells us that if we deal 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:56.180
 With an existing triangle - let me write this - if we are 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:02.340
 We deal with an existing triangle - not right - right or right. 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.640
 If we are dealing with an existing triangle 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.140
 It is a triangle with a 90-degree angle 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:17.060
 Therefore, the relationship between its aspects is this. 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:23.670
 So, this aspect is A and B and this is T. 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.190
 Remember that the side we are dealing with here 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.510
 Is the opposite side of the angle measuring 90 degrees. 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.430
 It is important to note what each side is. 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:38.030
 Pythagorean theory tells us that if and only if 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:44.330
 There was a square triangle with a quadrilateral square 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.270
 Equal squared. 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.630
 And to use this information. 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.960
 Knowing two of the three sides we can use 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.440
 This equation to find the third side. 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.640
 I will tell you another term here 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.600
 This long side, the longest aspect 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.650
 Triangle-based, and corresponding to the existing angle 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.590
 This is here - in the example - 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:10.840
 Call it chord. 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.400
 Tendon 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.090
 The name is very luxurious 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.050
 The longest side of the triangle is the opposite 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.770
 The 90-degree angle is called the tendon. 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.440
 Now that we know the theory of Pythagoras 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:27.620
 Let us use it. 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.070
 Because knowledge is good, but 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:31.250
 The pleasure is to use it. 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.860
 So let us say that I have the following triangle 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.800
 Let me paint one more confident than this. 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.770
 This is a triangle 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.080
 This aspect here is 9. 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.950
 This aspect length is 7. 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.900
 My question is, how long is this aspect here? 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.130
 Maybe we can call this t. 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.710
 Well, v here, again, is the chord. 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:00.640
 It's the tallest side. 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.840
 So we know that the total squares of the other two sides 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.140
 Equal to the T box 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:13.900
 So using Pythagorean theorem 9 squared + 7 squared 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.510
 = Squaring 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:24.260
 Squared = 81 + 7 Squared = 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.130
 80 + 40 = 120 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.630
 Then 1 + 9 these 10 other 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.260
 Total 130 (120 + 10) 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.660
 So write it this way. 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.290
 The total left side is equal to 130 and this is equal to 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.600
 Square T. 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.280
 So how much do you compare? 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.170
 Let me rewrite here. 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:52.550
 Square V equals 130 or we can say that 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:56.330
 The square root is equal to 130 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:58.610
 Note, I have taken into account the main root 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:00.210
 Only because it must be positive. 

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:03.580
 We are dealing with distance and therefore we can not take negative 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.400
 So we will take into consideration 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.600
 Only the positive root 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.716
 And to facilitate this we know how 

00:04:08.716 --> 00:04:09.960
 Simplify roots. 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:18.899
 130 is 2 hit 65 equals 5 hit 13 

00:04:18.899 --> 00:04:20.910
 So, these are all prime numbers, 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.740
 This is easy to find 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.820
 V equals root 130. 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.130
 Let us have one of these
