00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:05.480
I was ordained for some great purpose in

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.599
the hands of the Almighty

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.040
nat turner was an enslaved African

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.020
American preacher who was born in 1800

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.900
and led a large-scale resigned in 1831

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.609
that trans Ultima goes in the system of

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.949
slavery he chose violence as his only

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.130
option and then option painful and live

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.529
as it was shook up the system neck

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.739
Turner was a mind-blowing experience to

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.649
white culture and change the game in a

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:38.520
fundamental way

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.040
they vowed before they started the

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.110
revolt that they would kill every way

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.710
person they saw men women and children

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.989
they were done being dehumanized they

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.879
were done being treated as property and

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.289
they just rebelled the rebels followed

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.020
kind of a zigzag path they thought that

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.989
most of the houses along the way killing

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.689
the slaveholders and their families who

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.260
they found there

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.370
the judgment of this Court is that you

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.220
are to be taken into jail then to the

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.290
place of execution and be hung by the

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:25.110
neck until you are dead dead dead

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.240
lynching in America were spectator

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.470
sports nor spectator events people came

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.370
from miles around and bodies were

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:44.770
dismembered when people went to these

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.560
kinds of Affairs they wanted to take a

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.410
souvenir away that proved to everybody

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.050
that they were there and that that

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.509
person that monster is now no longer

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:59.140
alive and how do I know that because

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.300
I've got a piece of his body right here

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:22.199
