00:00:09.675 --> 00:00:11.925
Cancer is like a car crash.

00:00:11.925 --> 00:00:13.333
Your body typically regulates

00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:15.357
the speed at which your cells divide,

00:00:15.357 --> 00:00:18.508
but sometimes, cancer cuts the brake lines,

00:00:18.508 --> 00:00:20.675
and your cells divide too quickly,

00:00:20.675 --> 00:00:22.636
accumulating mutations that cause them

00:00:22.636 --> 00:00:24.888
to veer away from their original function,

00:00:24.888 --> 00:00:26.471
form dangerous tumors,

00:00:26.471 --> 00:00:28.758
and land you in the hospital.

00:00:28.758 --> 00:00:30.758
Cancer is basically an inability of the body

00:00:30.758 --> 00:00:33.425
to control the speed at which cells divide.

00:00:33.425 --> 00:00:35.147
When cells divide too quickly,

00:00:35.147 --> 00:00:37.233
they can often accumulate mutations

00:00:37.233 --> 00:00:40.320
that cause them to ignore their original function in the body,

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.071
forming tumors.

00:00:42.071 --> 00:00:44.116
In turn, these tumors may interfere

00:00:44.116 --> 00:00:47.008
with the natural processes of the body,

00:00:47.008 --> 00:00:49.092
such as digestion and respiration,

00:00:49.092 --> 00:00:51.092
potentially leading to death.

00:00:51.092 --> 00:00:54.083
Typically, your body has a number of genetic mechanisms

00:00:54.083 --> 00:00:56.334
to control how fast your cells divide.

00:00:56.334 --> 00:00:59.378
One of these genes is BRCA1,

00:00:59.378 --> 00:01:03.135
which stands for breast cancer susceptibility gene 1.

00:01:03.135 --> 00:01:05.841
BRCA1 belongs to a class of genes

00:01:05.841 --> 00:01:08.472
called tumor suppressor genes.

00:01:08.472 --> 00:01:10.142
Tumor suppressor genes are involved

00:01:10.142 --> 00:01:13.569
in regulating how fast a cell divides.

00:01:13.569 --> 00:01:16.341
Normally, cell division follows an orderly process

00:01:16.341 --> 00:01:17.816
called the cell cycle,

00:01:17.816 --> 00:01:20.110
which is basically the life cycle of a cell.

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:21.759
Within the cell cycle

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:23.447
is a series of checkpoints,

00:01:23.447 --> 00:01:26.364
where proteins, such as the one produced by BRCA1,

00:01:26.364 --> 00:01:29.341
regulate how fast the cell may proceed.

00:01:29.341 --> 00:01:31.120
How does it do this?

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:35.759
BRCA1 helps repair some forms of mutation in your DNA.

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.376
If your DNA is damaged,

00:01:37.376 --> 00:01:40.010
BRCA1 keeps the cell from dividing

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:41.679
until the mutation is repaired.

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:44.842
You have two copies of the BRCA1 gene

00:01:44.842 --> 00:01:46.303
in every cell of your body.

00:01:46.303 --> 00:01:48.424
One copy you inherited from Mom,

00:01:48.424 --> 00:01:49.973
the other from Dad.

00:01:49.973 --> 00:01:52.009
This redundancy is a good a thing

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:55.976
because you only need one functioning BRCA1 gene in a cell

00:01:55.976 --> 00:02:01.400
to regulate the cell cycle.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.009
But it's important to note

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:05.113
that while these copies have a similar function

00:02:05.113 --> 00:02:07.281
they're not necessarily the same.

00:02:07.281 --> 00:02:09.282
In fact, there are hundreds of variations,

00:02:09.282 --> 00:02:11.591
or alleles, of BRCA1.

00:02:11.591 --> 00:02:15.289
Some regulate the cell cycle more effectively than others.

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:16.540
In other words,

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:17.792
some people are born

00:02:17.792 --> 00:02:20.592
with better regulating and repair mechanisms than others.

00:02:20.592 --> 00:02:25.468
And in some cases, mutations may render BRCA1 ineffective.

00:02:25.468 --> 00:02:27.050
When this happens,

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.138
cells with damaged DNA are allowed to divide.

00:02:30.138 --> 00:02:31.425
As they divide,

00:02:31.425 --> 00:02:34.174
these cells may accumulate additional mutations.

00:02:34.174 --> 00:02:35.809
These mutations may cause the cell

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:37.478
to become less specialized

00:02:37.478 --> 00:02:40.758
and stop performing its original function in the tissue.

00:02:40.758 --> 00:02:43.066
If this occurs, then there's a greater chance

00:02:43.066 --> 00:02:45.758
they'll develop into cancer cells.

00:02:45.758 --> 00:02:49.614
While we all have the gene, such as BRCA1, that can cause cancer,

00:02:49.614 --> 00:02:52.325
it's only when these genes fail at their function

00:02:52.325 --> 00:02:54.175
that problems develop.

00:02:54.175 --> 00:02:57.207
Having an ineffective or mutated version of BRCA1

00:02:57.207 --> 00:02:59.679
can increase your susceptibility to cancer,

00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:01.795
much like driving with bad brakes

00:03:01.795 --> 00:03:03.629
increases the risk of an accident.
