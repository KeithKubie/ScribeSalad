00:00:01.584 --> 00:00:04.212
- You'll need to source steel

00:00:04.212 --> 00:00:07.757
on this cannon and combine
them into a blade that fulfills

00:00:07.757 --> 00:00:09.384
the following parameters.

00:00:09.384 --> 00:00:11.761
The length of your blade,
not including the tang,

00:00:11.761 --> 00:00:13.930
must be between
12 and 15 inches.

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:15.223
The overall length
of your weapon

00:00:15.223 --> 00:00:17.183
must not exceed 22 inches.

00:00:17.183 --> 00:00:19.394
You will have three hours
to forge your blades.

00:00:19.394 --> 00:00:20.520
Good luck, bladesmiths.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.690
Time starts now.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:25.358
I'm going to go ahead
and guess that we're going

00:00:25.358 --> 00:00:26.901
to see some teamwork here.

00:00:26.901 --> 00:00:29.362
There is enough actual
steel there for six smiths.

00:00:29.362 --> 00:00:30.780
Everybody want some of this?

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.782
Yeah, yeah Just take
that to the chop saw.

00:00:32.782 --> 00:00:37.454
[imitates chop saw]

00:00:37.454 --> 00:00:40.123
So we found out that
the axle for the cannon is

00:00:40.123 --> 00:00:41.833
high-carbon spring
steel, which is

00:00:41.833 --> 00:00:43.960
a great blade-making material.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.628
On a lot of early
fighting knives,

00:00:45.628 --> 00:00:47.297
they would have a
section of brass

00:00:47.297 --> 00:00:48.923
on the spine of the knife.

00:00:48.923 --> 00:00:52.010
So I decided to add the mild
steel spoke from the wheel

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.597
of the cannon and combine these
two different types of steel

00:00:55.597 --> 00:00:58.349
to meet the parameters
of the blade build.

00:00:58.349 --> 00:01:00.185
Daniel is the only
one of our smiths

00:01:00.185 --> 00:01:02.437
that has welded anything
together so far.

00:01:02.437 --> 00:01:05.064
I'm using the spoke
because it's the perfect size

00:01:05.064 --> 00:01:06.483
for the spine of my knife.

00:01:06.483 --> 00:01:08.526
And then I'm going to
rock on with my forging.

00:01:08.526 --> 00:01:09.819
There's always a
chance, when you're

00:01:09.819 --> 00:01:11.821
heading such a
massive piece of steel

00:01:11.821 --> 00:01:13.823
and a small piece of
steel, to forge weld

00:01:13.823 --> 00:01:15.366
them together, that
you're going to burn

00:01:15.366 --> 00:01:16.993
the small piece of steel.

00:01:16.993 --> 00:01:20.538
And I've never forge welded
on this particular type

00:01:20.538 --> 00:01:22.207
of spring steel.

00:01:22.207 --> 00:01:24.334
So I don't know the exact
parameters for the temperature

00:01:24.334 --> 00:01:26.127
limitations for it.

00:01:26.127 --> 00:01:28.004
I'm definitely having
second thoughts

00:01:28.004 --> 00:01:30.006
about my course of action.

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.135
Daniel's got a clear lead.

00:01:34.135 --> 00:01:36.262
He's way ahead of
everybody else.

00:01:36.262 --> 00:01:37.764
I'm at the point
now to where I can

00:01:37.764 --> 00:01:39.682
go ahead and harden the blade.

00:01:39.682 --> 00:01:41.976
Daniel has quit
with an hour and 16

00:01:41.976 --> 00:01:44.103
minutes left on the clock.

00:01:44.103 --> 00:01:45.730
The first thing
I see is a crack

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:49.526
about midway down the blade,
right on the cutting edge.

00:01:49.526 --> 00:01:51.402
And I thought, maybe I
can grind this thing out.

00:01:51.402 --> 00:01:53.571
So I keep cleaning on
the cutting edge up.

00:01:53.571 --> 00:01:57.200
And there's two more cracks
right on the cutting edge.

00:02:06.042 --> 00:02:08.837
Wait.
What-- what is happening?

00:02:08.837 --> 00:02:10.630
DANIEL: Immediately
sick to my stomach.

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.757
What's Daniel doing right now?

00:02:12.757 --> 00:02:14.968
What the [bleep] is
happening right now?

00:02:14.968 --> 00:02:16.678
Did Daniel abandon his blade?

00:02:16.678 --> 00:02:19.138
The last thing on the planet
that I want to do right now

00:02:19.138 --> 00:02:20.974
is start all over again.

00:02:20.974 --> 00:02:23.601
I don't know why you would
start working on something else

00:02:23.601 --> 00:02:26.062
with an hour left
in this competition.

00:02:26.062 --> 00:02:26.896
DANIEL: I have no options.

00:02:26.896 --> 00:02:28.565
I have to start over.

00:02:28.565 --> 00:02:30.733
I've got a long ways to go
and a short time to get there.

00:02:30.733 --> 00:02:33.236
I'm going to do everything
I can to catch up.

00:02:33.236 --> 00:02:35.738
That just shattered like
glass when I hardened it.

00:02:35.738 --> 00:02:38.032
30 minutes!

00:02:38.032 --> 00:02:41.161
The second blade isn't nearly
as refined as the first one.

00:02:41.161 --> 00:02:42.954
But if I can get
this thing quenched

00:02:42.954 --> 00:02:45.582
and get to the grinder for at
least three or four minutes,

00:02:45.582 --> 00:02:47.709
I feel like I might
have a chance to make

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:49.961
it through to the second round.

00:02:49.961 --> 00:02:51.754
It's not as hard
as I want it to be.

00:02:51.754 --> 00:02:54.507
But not every tool steel
is as hard as a file.

00:02:54.507 --> 00:02:57.135
So we're moving
on to the grinder.

00:02:57.135 --> 00:03:02.056
Five, four, three, two, one.

00:03:02.056 --> 00:03:03.516
Bladesmiths, shut
down your machines.

00:03:03.516 --> 00:03:04.851
Drop your tools.

00:03:04.851 --> 00:03:06.769
This forging round is over.

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:09.814
DANIEL: I definitely royally
screwed up the first blade.

00:03:09.814 --> 00:03:12.734
But I am happy that
I didn't give up.

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:18.197
Bladesmiths, in this
first round of competition,

00:03:18.197 --> 00:03:20.992
each of you had to source steal
from two different locations

00:03:20.992 --> 00:03:22.702
on a cannon.

00:03:22.702 --> 00:03:24.621
It's time for the judges to
take a closer look at your work.

00:03:24.621 --> 00:03:25.747
All right, Daniel,
please present

00:03:25.747 --> 00:03:28.666
your blade to the judges.

00:03:28.666 --> 00:03:31.961
MAN 1: This was really
smart, fast work.

00:03:31.961 --> 00:03:33.880
I would love to see
that fitted up better.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.757
But you hammered this
out and got this done

00:03:35.757 --> 00:03:37.592
in basically half the time.

00:03:37.592 --> 00:03:39.385
And you've got just
enough of a tang

00:03:39.385 --> 00:03:41.137
here for a blade this size.

00:03:41.137 --> 00:03:43.264
So seeing how you're going
to connect the handle,

00:03:43.264 --> 00:03:45.099
work it into this blade,
and work it into that guard

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:46.851
is going to be interesting.

00:03:46.851 --> 00:03:47.810
Good job.

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.270
Thank you very much, sir.

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:50.605
Jesse, you're up next.

00:03:50.605 --> 00:03:52.899
Please present your
blade to the judges.

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:56.027
MAN 2: Well, Jesse, you started
with a huge piece of steel.

00:03:56.027 --> 00:03:57.654
I think it really hindered
you in your ability

00:03:57.654 --> 00:03:59.405
to get things moving.

00:03:59.405 --> 00:04:02.325
The handle is kind of
big in all dimensions.

00:04:02.325 --> 00:04:05.078
I like that you designed a
chopper, but it is quite rough.

00:04:05.078 --> 00:04:06.579
I mean, it's still rectangular.

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:08.081
Despite all of it, you
turned something in

00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:09.958
and it meets the parameter.
- Thank you.

00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:11.292
WIL: Collin, you're up.

00:04:11.292 --> 00:04:13.795
Please present your
blade to the judges.

00:04:13.795 --> 00:04:16.089
That kind of drop
to the handle--

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:18.174
I mean, it'll be
interesting, moving forward,

00:04:18.174 --> 00:04:20.593
to see how you're going to
deal with this whole section

00:04:20.593 --> 00:04:23.304
and incorporate
it into a handle.

00:04:23.304 --> 00:04:25.974
Bladesmiths, the judges have
completed their deliberation

00:04:25.974 --> 00:04:27.850
and they've made
a final decision.

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:29.227
The bladesmith
leaving the forge--

00:04:33.898 --> 00:04:36.609
Jesse, your blade
did not make the cut.

00:04:36.609 --> 00:04:38.695
Doug Marcaida's going
to tell you why.

00:04:38.695 --> 00:04:41.864
Jesse, I hope you take from
this experience to continue on,

00:04:41.864 --> 00:04:43.700
because the world
awaits your work.

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.160
But at the end of the day, your
blade was the least finished.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.162
And that's the reason
we're sending you home.

00:04:48.162 --> 00:04:49.163
Jesse, please
surrender your blade.
