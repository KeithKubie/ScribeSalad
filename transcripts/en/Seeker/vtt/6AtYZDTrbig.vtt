00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:02.320
Say hello to my little FREND.

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:03.800
IT'Sâ€¦ it's The NOSE.

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:04.800
And you know what?

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.630
It doesn't want any of those things that you're
trying to sniff up there.

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:16.700
Stop it.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:21.170
Insufflation or the act of inhaling something
through the nose is an ancient practice; Google's

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.740
NGram viewer finds references to insufflation
all the way back to the late-1600s when the

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.210
term was coined.

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.900
Insufflation is even part of some religious
ceremonies,, and was probably a way to consume

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.620
tobacco before we learned to dry and smoke
it.

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.750
Even though it's harmful, snorting is pervasive
in our culture.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.700
It's so visible, a third grader was suspended
in Atlanta for snorting crushed up candies

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.120
back in 2013.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.190
And recently, powdered alcohol, or "palcohol,"
was legalized for sale in the U.S.; and there

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.780
are concerns people will begin snorting that
too!

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.230
Though according to the company's website,
it would take an hour to snort enough powder

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.150
to equal one shot of vodka.

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:01.690
Even chocolatiers of today advertise the ability
to snort their cocoa!

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.250
For when ingesting something isn't enough,
people tend to follow their nose; why is that?

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.560
Well, the nose is a hole in the front of your
skull with a bone at the top and cartilage

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.560
at the bottom.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:12.930
It's divided by the nasal septum.

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.080
Behind the nose are four sinus chambers which
together are pretty large -- an average of

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.010
15 cubic centimeters.

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.600
They extend as far back as your throat, and
contains folds of bone and cartilage called

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.150
turbinates to increase the surface area of
the mucous membrane which lines the whole

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.280
internal structure.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.300
The membrane is densely packed with blood
cells, which is why when you snort something

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.630
things get a little crazy.

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.790
When a drug, like cocaine for instance, is
mixed with hydrochloric acid, it turns into

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.460
a salt powder, which can then be sniffed or
snorted.

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.620
When the fine powder hits the mucous membranes
it adheres to the membrane and is absorbed

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:45.620
by the bloodstream.

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:50.500
Once there, it heads from the nose down to
the heart, then to the lungs to get oxygenated;

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.000
once oxygenated that blood goes back to the
heart and then all over the body.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.780
Though popular legend is snorting is the quickest
high, smoking is actually quicker, because

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.190
the breath which oxygenates the blood carries
with it the chemical compounds; cutting out

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.760
the trip from nose, to heart, to lungs.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.409
The problem with snorting ANYTHING is the
nose didn't evolve to process physical particles

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:12.230
of that size and absorb them.

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:13.909
It's sort of a body hack.

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:17.700
Over time, the mucous membranes wear down
and stop humidifying air before it enters

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.060
the body.

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.599
Even something as harmless as chocolate can
cause scarring and damage.

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:27.959
Continued use of cocaine causes perforations
of the nasal septum -- the bridge that holds

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:33.739
up the nose -- sores in the membrane, chest
infections, and of course nosebleeds, colds,

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:39.489
inflammation and, if it gets worse, the collapse
of the nose itself,; not to mention a cocaine

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:40.489
addiction.

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:42.530
You can even lose your sense of smell altogether.

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.700
If the tissue dies, flies can lay eggs and
produce nasal maggots -- which CAN live in

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:56.689
the sinuses feed on the dead flesh -- though
doctors admit that 

00:02:56.689 --> 00:03:03.400
it extremely rare.
