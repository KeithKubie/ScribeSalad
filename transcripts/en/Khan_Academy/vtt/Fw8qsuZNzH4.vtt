00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:01.690
- [Instructor] Let's
say that we've come up

00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:04.720
with a new pill that we
think has a good chance

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.670
of helping people with diabetes
control their blood sugar.

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.240
When someone has diabetes,

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:11.850
their blood sugars unusually high,

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:15.450
that damages their body in
a bunch of different ways.

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.030
So we want to conduct
an experiment to test if

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:22.670
this pill really can help
people lower their blood sugar.

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:24.410
So the first thing we
need to think about is

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:26.480
how do we even measure or test

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.400
whether peoples' blood
sugar is getting lower.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.690
Well, for our experiment,
what's typically done

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:35.023
is we measure folks hemoglobin A1C.

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:37.350
You don't have to worry too much

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.090
about this in the context of statistics.

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.100
But hemoglobin A1C test is a way

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.120
that's typically used to measure

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.900
your average blood sugar
over the last three months,

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.710
and we have whole videos on Khan Academy

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.050
explaining how that works.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.060
So our hope would be that
our pill lowers peoples'

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.680
blood sugar which shows
up as a lowered A1C.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.000
Now we have terms for this.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.990
The thing that is causing
something else to change,

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:07.150
we call this the explanatory variable.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.740
Explanatory variable,

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.250
and the thing that might get changed

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:14.990
by that explanatory variable, depending

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:16.450
on whether you take the pill or not,

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.083
we call that our response.

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.060
Response variable.

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.090
So now let's actually
conduct the experiment.

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:26.248
So what we would do is

00:01:26.248 --> 00:01:28.933
we would go to the population.

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.750
Population of diabetics,

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.710
and we would want to take a random sample

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.800
from that population of diabetics.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.250
A reasonably large one,
and later in statistics

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.370
we talk about what a good
size sample might be.

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.990
But let's say that we randomly sample.

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.790
Randomly sample

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:54.710
100 folks.

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.640
So we randomly sample 100 folks

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.290
from that population of diabetics,

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.700
and then you would want to assign

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.310
these folks randomly to
two different groups.

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.880
One would be your control group,

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.580
and this would be the group of people

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.350
who won't take the new medicine,

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.090
and then you would have
your treatment group.

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.410
These are the groups of folks

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.150
who will be given the new medicine.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.220
The treatment group.

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.710
Now in some cases, you
can just randomly assign

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:27.260
these 100 folks between these two groups,

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:28.850
and one way to do it is you could give all

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.560
of them a random number
between one and 100

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.390
and then the top 50 go into treatment

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:34.910
and the bottom 50 go into the control,

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.400
or there's, you can use a
computer to randomly assign folks.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.700
Now sometimes you might want to be

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.970
a little bit more sophisticated than that.

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.010
For example, there might be
evidence that someone's sex

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.730
might somehow influence
how they respond to a drug.

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.020
So what you could do is
something called block design

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.130
where, let's say, this group just happens

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.970
to have 60 females and 40 males.

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:00.483
One block design.

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.740
You can randomly assign,
but you can do it in a way

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.350
that you can ensure that
both of these groups

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.110
have the same proportions
of male and females.

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.470
So for example, if you
have 60 females here,

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.500
you can ensure that 30 of
them end up in the control,

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.330
and 30 end up in the treatment.

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.190
But you would assign those,
those 60 females randomly

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:22.380
between these two groups,

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.990
and similarly, you can do block design

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:27.820
of these 40 males, 20
end up in the control,

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.250
and 20 end up in the treatment.

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.130
So once you have folks
in both of these groups,

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.030
what you would probably want to do

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.670
is measure their A1C at the beginning.

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.840
You can view that as a baseline,

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.030
and then, over the
course of the experiment,

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.030
you would give the pill
to the treatment group,

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.210
and in the control group,
you might be saying,

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:51.920
well, we would just wouldn't do anything.

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.150
But the best practice is
actually to give a pill

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.870
that looks just like the real
thing to the control group.

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.930
This is known as a placebo,

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.000
and the reason why we do that

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.930
is there's definitely evidence
that when people think

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.380
they are taking a pill
that might help them,

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.940
that even psychologically it
can have an effect on them,

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.470
and sometimes it helps them.

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:16.800
This is known as the placebo effect,

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.030
and not only would you give both groups

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:20.520
a pill that looks the same,

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:22.520
even though this one
in the treatment group

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.110
actually has the medicine
in it, you also would

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.610
not want to tell folks
which group they are in.

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:30.840
When you don't tell them
which group they're in,

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.420
that's known as a blind experiment,

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.110
and you probably also don't
want to tell the people

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.030
who are administering the
experiment which group

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.310
they are administering, and
that's called a double blind.

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.790
So even the doctors or the nurses

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:46.200
that are administering the experiment,

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:47.800
when they're giving a
pill to the control group,

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.480
they don't know that
that pill is the placebo,

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.107
and you might say, well,
why is it important

00:04:52.107 --> 00:04:54.500
for an experiment to be blind,

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.350
or especially double blind.

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:59.390
Well, that avoids, one, any
type of psychological effect

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:01.290
on the, from the point of the patient.

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:04.150
Or from the, say the
caregivers in this situation,

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:05.650
so that they don't kind of give it away.

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:06.680
They don't tell these folks,

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.270
hey, you're actually just
pretending to take a pill,

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.600
and so that ensures that
we minimize the amount

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.940
of influence or bias that might happen.

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.020
You might even have a
triple blind experiment

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.190
where even the folks who are
analyzing the eventual data

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:22.420
from this experiment don't
know whether they're analyzing

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:24.310
the data from the
control or the treatment.

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:26.640
They just compare the
two different groups.

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:30.520
But anyway, you do, you
people take the medicine

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.640
and the placebo over the
course of the experiment.

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.620
Maybe this lasts for three months,

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.900
and then you would want to
measure their A1C later,

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:42.330
and then you would see
their change in the A1C.

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:44.340
Now if you saw that there
wasn't really a difference

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:46.620
in the change in A1C between the control

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:48.390
and the treatment group, then you'd say,

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:52.410
well, that probably means
that my pill didn't work.

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:54.520
Now if you do get a greater reduction in

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.750
the treatment group, and you
do the statistical analysis

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:58.210
which we will learn in statistics

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:00.820
and you show that, hey,
there's a very low probability

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:03.230
that's happened purely due to chance.

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:04.480
Well then, you've got something.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:06.940
You could probably conclude that

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:08.860
there is a causal connection between

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:12.560
taking the pill and
lowering your A1C level.

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:16.110
But once again, you cannot be 100% sure,

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:18.913
and so, this is why it's very important

00:06:18.913 --> 00:06:23.083
for people to be able to
replicate your experiment.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.990
Because what you'd want
to do either yourself

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:28.300
or other researchers might want to conduct

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:30.240
the experiment with different sample sizes

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.460
and different countries
and different populations,

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:35.140
maybe with different ages
at different times of year

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:38.763
to ensure that they
continue to see this result.
