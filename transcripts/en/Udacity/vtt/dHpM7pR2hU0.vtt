00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:02.580
In this lesson, we'll talk about

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.040
multimedia and streaming. We'll talk about digital

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.720
audio and video data, multimedia applications, in

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.010
particular, streaming audio and video for playback.

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:16.129
Multimedia transfers over a best-effort network,

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:19.170
in particular, how to tolerate packet loss

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.700
delay and jitter, and quality of service.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.720
So we use multimedia and streaming video

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.770
very frequently on todays internet. YouTube streaming

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.710
videos are an example of multimedia streaming

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:41.470
as are applications for video or voice chat such as Skype or Google Hangout.

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:42.930
In this lecture we'll talk about the

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.580
challenges for streaming these types of applications

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:51.840
over best effort networks. As well has how to solve those challenges. We'll also

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.830
talk about the basics of digital audio and video data.

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.180
First of all, let's talk about the challenges for media streaming.
