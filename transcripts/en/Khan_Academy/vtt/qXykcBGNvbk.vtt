00:00:00.235 --> 00:00:01.068
- [Voiceover] Hello, grammarians.

00:00:01.068 --> 00:00:01.901
Hello, Paige.

00:00:01.901 --> 00:00:02.734
- [Paige] Hi, David.

00:00:02.734 --> 00:00:03.567
- [David] Today we're going to talk about

00:00:03.567 --> 00:00:04.909
identifying subjects and predicates

00:00:04.909 --> 00:00:07.762
and in order to do that, we
shall begin with a sentence.

00:00:07.762 --> 00:00:10.015
Paige, would you read
me the sentence, please?

00:00:10.015 --> 00:00:11.856
- [Paige] I bought a crate of goblin hats.

00:00:11.856 --> 00:00:14.365
- [David] Thank you, Paige.

00:00:14.365 --> 00:00:16.783
So Paige, do you think
that's hats for goblins,

00:00:16.783 --> 00:00:19.951
or hats that make you look like a goblin?

00:00:19.951 --> 00:00:21.183
- [Paige] Well, I bought it, so I can say

00:00:21.183 --> 00:00:22.858
that it is both.

00:00:22.858 --> 00:00:26.373
- [David] So we could go either
way is what you're saying.

00:00:26.373 --> 00:00:27.206
- [Paige] (Laughs) Oh, yeah.

00:00:27.206 --> 00:00:28.536
- [David] A sentence is
kind of a like a car.

00:00:28.536 --> 00:00:30.679
It's got a lot of different
parts, like an engine,

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:33.262
or wheels, or a body, whatever.

00:00:33.262 --> 00:00:34.816
A sentence is very much the same way

00:00:34.816 --> 00:00:38.319
and you can divide up
a sentence into parts.

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:40.930
Today, we're going to be
dividing up the sentence

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.724
into subject and predicate.

00:00:43.724 --> 00:00:46.020
Paige, what is the subject of a sentence?

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.976
- [Paige] The subject
is a noun or a pronoun

00:00:48.976 --> 00:00:52.309
that is doing the action in the sentence

00:00:54.533 --> 00:00:56.271
or performing the verb.

00:00:56.271 --> 00:00:58.119
- [David] What does that
mean to perform a verb?

00:00:58.119 --> 00:01:01.057
- [Paige] Right, so a verb
isn't always an action, right?

00:01:01.057 --> 00:01:02.398
That's why I wanted to clarify.

00:01:02.398 --> 00:01:03.231
- [David] Mm-hmm.

00:01:03.231 --> 00:01:05.170
- [Paige] Because you
can say, "I am happy."

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.764
Am is a verb, but that's not
an action that I'm doing.

00:01:08.764 --> 00:01:11.094
- [David] Right, you
can't just actively am.

00:01:11.094 --> 00:01:12.151
- [Paige] Right. (laughs)

00:01:12.151 --> 00:01:14.344
- [David] But in the
sentence, "I am happy,"

00:01:14.344 --> 00:01:18.356
the subject I is performing
the verb to be, or am.

00:01:18.356 --> 00:01:19.189
- [Paige] Right.

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:20.022
- [David] Gotcha.

00:01:20.022 --> 00:01:21.619
What is a predicate?

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:24.980
- [Paige] A predicate is all
of the rest of the sentence

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:26.269
that isn't the subject.

00:01:26.269 --> 00:01:28.052
What it really is is the verb

00:01:28.052 --> 00:01:31.807
and all of the parts that
are related to the verb.

00:01:31.807 --> 00:01:33.736
Yeah, verb and its pals, that's good.

00:01:33.736 --> 00:01:36.328
- [David] Let's apply that
approach to goblin hat sentence.

00:01:36.328 --> 00:01:37.161
- [Paige] Mm-hmm.

00:01:37.161 --> 00:01:40.126
- [David] Okay, so I'm
looking for a noun or pronoun

00:01:40.126 --> 00:01:42.279
that performs a verb in the sentence.

00:01:42.279 --> 00:01:44.302
Well, I found the verb
and the verb is bought.

00:01:44.302 --> 00:01:45.602
Who's doing the buying?

00:01:45.602 --> 00:01:46.507
I am.

00:01:46.507 --> 00:01:47.340
- [Paige] Right.

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.220
- [David] So our subject is I.

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:49.431
- [Paige] Yeah.

00:01:49.431 --> 00:01:51.790
- [David] Then predicate is basically

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.221
everything else, right?

00:01:53.221 --> 00:01:55.241
It's bought, what did I buy?

00:01:55.241 --> 00:01:57.040
A crate of goblin hats.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.259
- [Paige] Right.

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.792
You can see that a crate of goblin hats

00:01:59.792 --> 00:02:01.571
is also a noun, right?

00:02:01.571 --> 00:02:03.835
But it's not doing
anything in the sentence.

00:02:03.835 --> 00:02:04.668
I am buying.

00:02:04.668 --> 00:02:06.028
- [David] Just because there's a noun,

00:02:06.028 --> 00:02:08.073
just because there's another
noun in the sentence,

00:02:08.073 --> 00:02:10.956
like crate or goblin hats,
doesn't necessarily mean

00:02:10.956 --> 00:02:13.526
that it's the subject.

00:02:13.526 --> 00:02:14.359
- [Paige] Right.

00:02:14.359 --> 00:02:16.829
- [David] So you have to
look for the thing that is

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:18.299
performing the verb.

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:19.315
- [Paige] Exactly.

00:02:19.315 --> 00:02:21.593
- [David] Paige, I think
that covers everything except

00:02:21.593 --> 00:02:25.737
exactly what a goblin hat is,
but we can talk about that

00:02:25.737 --> 00:02:26.672
some other time.

00:02:26.672 --> 00:02:27.667
- [Paige] Yeah.

00:02:27.667 --> 00:02:29.556
- [David] That's identifying
subjects and predicates.

00:02:29.556 --> 00:02:31.220
You can learn anything.

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:32.053
David out.

00:02:32.053 --> 00:02:33.108
- [Paige] Paige out.
