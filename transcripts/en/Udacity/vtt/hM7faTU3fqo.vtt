00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Welcome to Office Hours for this week.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I'm here with Adam Sherwin. Job is sick today, so Adam has kindly stepped in.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Adam is one of our new TAs.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
He is going to be TAing a statistics course that we'll be starting fairly soon.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Thanks, Adam. What questions do we have for today?

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Alice asked about the math used in Unit 3, specifically what is z sub q?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
This is a good question. I have been fairly informal with the math that we use in this class.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I want to focus on the fun parts of crypto, but really to understand things

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
it's important to understand the math deeply.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I will put a link to some great free notes from an MIT course that goes into a lot of detail

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
on the math that will have a good definition of this.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
On the specific question of what z sub q is--

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
this means the group of integers over multiplication.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:57.000
If q is a prime number that is all the numbers from 1 up to that prime number minus 1,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and a group is defined by the set of elements and operations.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
So we use the numerals that we understand to show the members of the group,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
but they could be any symbol. What matters is what the operations do on those elements.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
The multiplicative groups on integers have the properties that correspond

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
to what we think about integer multiplication having,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
except for modulo the size of the group.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
When it's a prime, these are very useful for cryptography.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
That's what I mean by z sub q.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
It's the multiplicative group of integers, so it's the numbers from 1 up to q - 1.

00:01:28.000 --> 99:59:59.000
When q us prime that's the same thing as z&lt;i&gt;q, which is what you'll sometimes see written.&lt;/i&gt;
