1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:03,210
The Joe Rogan experience. All right, cool.

2
00:00:03,211 --> 00:00:06,330
So we were just talking about your books
and I tried, I said, let's save it.

3
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:10,590
Let's save it for the podcast
because I wanted it to sound fresh.

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,340
I want you to reset. So tell
me about, you wrote two books.

5
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:18,690
I wrote two books and you know,
as you know, I'm a, you know,

6
00:00:18,691 --> 00:00:22,410
movie writer and a movie and television
producer said mildly. I mean,

7
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:27,210
I made some fucking amazing movies. Wow.
Thanks. Thanks Joe. My pleasure. Yeah.

8
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:31,800
And um, uh, and all this, I think,

9
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:33,510
you know, uh,

10
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:37,860
my whole life and whatever those stories
are the movies are and the successes,

11
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:43,050
I kinda think anyone that's really
focused can, can do what I do.

12
00:00:43,051 --> 00:00:47,100
So that was kind of the end product
of the first book, which was,

13
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,100
it was called a curious mind,
the secret to bigger life.

14
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:54,300
And um, that book is really about,

15
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:58,800
I mean, how much do you want to know
about it and everything? Everything. Okay.

16
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:04,220
So basically I couldn't read it all in
elementary school and it caused a lot of

17
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,520
trauma, a lot of shame. And then a
lot of trauma. Did you have dyslexia?

18
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:15,060
I had dyslexia, very,
very quite acute dyslexia.

19
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:19,860
And I think we're out in Woodland Hills,
which was the fancy part of the Valley.

20
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,090
I grew up in the flats of
Sherman Oaks. Uh, actually as a,

21
00:01:24,091 --> 00:01:27,510
as a little kid going to Riverside drive
elementary school and then later to

22
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:30,810
Nobel junior high and then
later Chatsworth high school.

23
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:35,040
And in elementary school
I couldn't read it all.

24
00:01:35,041 --> 00:01:40,041
And they didn't classify it as
dyslexia that it was just your slow,

25
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:46,380
you're dumb. You, uh, why can't you
answer this? Uh, and then you'd say,

26
00:01:46,381 --> 00:01:48,840
I can't read. And then
that didn't make sense.

27
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,660
It just didn't see none of
those things computed really,

28
00:01:51,661 --> 00:01:56,661
that somebody couldn't actually read a
word and I really couldn't read a word.

29
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,130
So when you can't read a word,

30
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:03,930
then you find ways to uh, survive, cope,

31
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:08,850
um, and not have the teacher
look you in the eyes and say,

32
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:09,990
okay Brian,

33
00:02:09,991 --> 00:02:13,830
come to the board and answer this question
because you're never just going to

34
00:02:13,831 --> 00:02:16,350
produce more shame cause you're
not, you don't know the answer.

35
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,220
It's not possible. So I found that, um,

36
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:24,780
as that went on for a little while, for
quite a while around the fourth, fifth,

37
00:02:24,781 --> 00:02:27,360
sixth grade, I really looked at people,

38
00:02:27,361 --> 00:02:30,960
I really looked them in the eyes to learn.

39
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:35,670
And I've found that by looking
somebody in the eyes, you could engage,

40
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:38,730
I didn't know this then,
but you engage their heart.

41
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:42,690
If you're really doing it
with sincerity and interest,

42
00:02:42,691 --> 00:02:46,350
you can engage people and move
them and evangelize things young,

43
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:50,190
get people to like play on your
team and or you play on their team,

44
00:02:50,191 --> 00:02:54,630
they pick you and stuff. Good things
happen. Um, except the reading part.

45
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:56,191
Um, but it,

46
00:02:56,191 --> 00:03:01,191
it enabled me to learn a lot just by
looking at people and talking to people.

47
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:05,440
And my, I had this one mentor,
this little grandmother, uh,

48
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:08,560
her name was Sonya and a
little Sonia. She's like

49
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,970
four, 10, I guess, you know.

50
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:18,100
And she would always say to me,
she'd see me once a week, minimally,

51
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:21,100
always once a week, and she'd
say, you're going all the way,

52
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:23,710
you're going to make it
big, think big, be big.

53
00:03:23,711 --> 00:03:27,850
And she had all these isms because a
half my mom's side of the family was

54
00:03:27,851 --> 00:03:31,180
Jewish. My dad's side of the
family's Catholic, the Jewish side,

55
00:03:31,181 --> 00:03:33,550
the grandmother was my mentor.

56
00:03:33,551 --> 00:03:37,600
And the worst thing that really was the
single person that I could kind of count

57
00:03:37,601 --> 00:03:42,010
on in life. And she'd constantly tell
me how, how things, I'd go, great.

58
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:46,750
You have a gift for gab, she'd
say, and, and every time she said,

59
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,550
you're gonna go all the way.

60
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,210
I'm thinking there's like
absolutely no empirical evidence.

61
00:03:52,211 --> 00:03:56,730
I'm going all the way anywhere except
my parents were always arguing,

62
00:03:56,830 --> 00:04:00,190
let's put him back. The teacher,
miss STIGs had, let's put him back.

63
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,980
So I just wasn't going
anywhere. I didn't think so.

64
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:06,220
So that gave rise to me,

65
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:10,900
give rise to the fact that I thought
the way I can really learn a lot is have

66
00:04:10,901 --> 00:04:15,100
these kind of curiosity conversations.
And once I graduated college,

67
00:04:15,101 --> 00:04:18,520
I did this on a weekly basis.
And if still do it to this day,

68
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:22,180
once a week, sometimes
once every two weeks,

69
00:04:22,181 --> 00:04:25,990
but never more than once every two
weeks. I never, I'm pretty militant.

70
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,590
I'm extremely militant about it. Like
how do you do it? Like what do you mean?

71
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:35,530
Um, well what I do is I think
about, it's often, and I,

72
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:40,510
I know you do something possibly
similar to this and, and, and,

73
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,530
but my system would be,
I bombard myself with,

74
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,690
now I can read of course. Um,

75
00:04:46,691 --> 00:04:48,910
and I was able to start to
read like in high school,

76
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:52,090
can you tell me how they fix that?
They couldn't fix it. It's not,

77
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:57,160
it wasn't fixable. How to dyslexia
reverses words on you, right?

78
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:01,450
Uh, versus the way you view letters
and, yeah. Well, it's scary.

79
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:04,120
Initially as a kid it's
scrambles the letters.

80
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:08,350
Then when it gets better,
it reverses the words.

81
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:14,190
And to this day I still start
on the right and go to the left.

82
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,800
So it takes like really thoughtful,

83
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,990
disciplined to make sure
I'm always starting.

84
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,070
Do you mean with the sentences or the
sentences with a sentence? Really.

85
00:05:24,071 --> 00:05:27,370
So you'll start at the right end of the,
you should read Hebrew or something.

86
00:05:27,371 --> 00:05:31,900
Isn't that different languages
do that, right? Yeah,

87
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,610
I guess they do. Um,

88
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:37,090
but incidentally when you have dyslexia
it's very hard to learn other languages.

89
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,120
So I would imagine
very, very hard. So, um,

90
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,440
but I can read and I bombard myself.
So how do you switch it around?

91
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,440
Like when, when your, your brain is
making you read right to left? Yes.

92
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:56,170
Um, I, I, I started to learn, just
create like, just like an exercise,

93
00:05:56,171 --> 00:06:00,710
a discipline where I could,
like in K as in college,

94
00:06:00,711 --> 00:06:02,390
I was able to read,

95
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,780
I get forced myself to start on
the left and go to the right.

96
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,560
Is there a certain mechanism that's
causing you to do right? To laugh?

97
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:14,120
Like do they know what the cause
of this is? Not that I know of. Hm.

98
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:18,500
Not that I know. Probably something
neurological and certainly genetic.

99
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:23,300
I mean I have no genetic trace, but it
has to be a letter within your genome.

100
00:06:23,301 --> 00:06:24,620
I have to get, having to guess.

101
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:28,640
So you learned how to read,

102
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:32,170
you learned how to figure it
out. And then you said you,

103
00:06:32,171 --> 00:06:35,150
you have these conversations
at least once every two weeks.

104
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:38,450
So how do you do this? Like, what
do you do? You organize them,

105
00:06:38,451 --> 00:06:41,990
they're structured, they're
structured. They, they, they're,

106
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:47,020
they see there's a randomness to
them because often you'd have to,

107
00:06:47,461 --> 00:06:48,294
I have to,

108
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:52,990
it's not like getting on your show where
everybody wants to be in the show. Uh,

109
00:06:52,991 --> 00:06:56,810
I say that with a compliment of
course, but I, I'm begging people you,

110
00:06:56,811 --> 00:06:58,340
because even though down with you,

111
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:02,030
I'm begging him to sit down with
me and I'm groveling and uh,

112
00:07:02,031 --> 00:07:05,450
I'm calling assistance directly.
I still, I have three assistants,

113
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:09,470
but I make all of my own phone
calls always. You know, why?

114
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:13,820
Because I have this discipline of getting
to know assistance and going, Hey,

115
00:07:13,821 --> 00:07:17,870
it's Brian is Richard around
or, and I just like, I do that.

116
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:22,670
That's so refreshing from a guy who's
as successful as you are because so many

117
00:07:22,671 --> 00:07:24,530
times when people get that successful,

118
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:28,130
you insulate yourself with a bunch of
other people that do all the calls for you

119
00:07:28,131 --> 00:07:30,380
and open all the doors for
you and you just kinda,

120
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:35,180
you stay insulated and
more aloof. Yeah. Thanks.

121
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:39,860
Well, thank you. Thanks. Well, I,
yeah, they do. People do. I mean look,

122
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:42,710
there are producers that are
sort of, that are, you know,

123
00:07:42,711 --> 00:07:47,660
let's say we're in the same category,
same ill that just do it differently. I,

124
00:07:47,661 --> 00:07:51,380
I made a lot of deliberate
choices through trial and error.

125
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:53,150
I saw,

126
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:58,150
I went through the 80s where power guys
had desks above the other chairs that

127
00:07:59,511 --> 00:08:00,500
are on the other side.

128
00:08:00,501 --> 00:08:05,501
I have the power guys always had black
lacquer furniture and they did all these

129
00:08:06,741 --> 00:08:11,600
power things. And I thought, I want to re,

130
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:14,450
I want artists to like me relate to me.

131
00:08:14,451 --> 00:08:19,400
And I always did everything to create a
democratic environment because not that

132
00:08:19,401 --> 00:08:20,600
I was such a cool guy,

133
00:08:20,601 --> 00:08:24,740
but more like you just get so much
more out of a creative person by not

134
00:08:24,741 --> 00:08:29,120
intimidating them. Sure. Yeah.
And I just saw, you know,

135
00:08:29,121 --> 00:08:33,260
my peers and sometimes often, you know,
someone maybe a decade ahead of me,

136
00:08:33,261 --> 00:08:35,480
you know, I don't want to say I'm
so close to saying names, but,

137
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:40,070
but just those sort of tough
guys, you know? Um, and I,

138
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:44,060
I didn't think that was an effective,
I just didn't think it was effective.

139
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:47,930
And I wasn't making these
really hardcore action movies.

140
00:08:47,931 --> 00:08:51,080
I was doing movies that were,
they're designed to a mite,

141
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,950
a ignite emotion and feeling. In fact,

142
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,870
even when I do public speaking, I say, Oh,

143
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,320
Brian Grazer dead or whatever
they might say. But I goes, I'm,

144
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:04,800
I always say I'm in the feelings
business. I'm not a movie producer,

145
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:05,663
so I'm just a,

146
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:10,700
I'm in the feelings business because I
feel like that's what we want out of a

147
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:13,740
cinematic experience for me. Sure.

148
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:19,010
The movies I'm interested in
doing or TV shows is that,

149
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:22,160
so, um, because I,

150
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:27,170
I grew up loving those movies in the 70s
and I'm captivated by things that move

151
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:30,960
me emotionally and elevate me emotional.

152
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:35,700
So you make these phone calls and
you arrange these conversations.

153
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:39,810
So you arrange basically a
podcast that no one's listening to

154
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,820
that's kind of like you. That's exactly,

155
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:49,020
I never thought of it in those
words. That is really funny.

156
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:53,580
You should probably record them.
I S so I've done it for say,

157
00:09:53,581 --> 00:09:55,380
35 years. Really?

158
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:58,620
You didn't record any of them
the first 15 years and nothing.

159
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,990
I didn't write no really notes either.

160
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:06,120
And then the second 10
years that was, you know,

161
00:10:06,121 --> 00:10:07,710
I'd say 15 was nothing.

162
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:12,810
I just did it cause I felt like that could
inhibit somebody or I felt like I was

163
00:10:12,811 --> 00:10:16,110
trying to do these sort
of down low in a way.

164
00:10:16,111 --> 00:10:19,710
Like I didn't want to
commodify them, you know,

165
00:10:19,711 --> 00:10:24,390
like industrialized by conversations
and I had friends go like, Oh,

166
00:10:24,391 --> 00:10:28,410
can we be part of it? And I tried
it once with a couple other guys.

167
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:33,270
It during my thing and it
fractionalized or my attention. Yeah.

168
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:38,370
And it, it, when I found the great
thing about the conversations,

169
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:42,300
the one on one with no one else in the
room, which that's all I do. Again, I've,

170
00:10:42,301 --> 00:10:45,930
I tried it different
ways. It, it create your,

171
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,400
what's you're trying to do,

172
00:10:47,401 --> 00:10:52,050
I'm trying to do is like create the best
date that Isaac Asimov I've had had or,

173
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:56,430
or you know, or I mean I have so
many people, you know, just uh,

174
00:10:56,460 --> 00:11:00,180
Margaret Thatcher. I'm
trying to, like, I'm,

175
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:01,800
I'm trying to be,

176
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:06,420
have no idea of a time and space and I
want them to have no idea of time and

177
00:11:06,421 --> 00:11:10,110
space and because that
is like your best date.

178
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:15,270
And I always think like my, what is
my best date with a girl? My very,

179
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:18,000
for me Brian, cause I,
I, I, my best date is,

180
00:11:18,001 --> 00:11:21,600
I'm not even thinking about time
and it's just becomes almost like a,

181
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:24,750
a biochemical event. It's
just things are evolving.

182
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:29,370
And I felt like I could do this with
Nobel, with many Nobel laureates,

183
00:11:29,371 --> 00:11:34,140
with Sheldon glass cow who converted
the four forces of Daisy nation, uh,

184
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:39,000
uh, of, of nature to three. And I
brought his name up because, uh,

185
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:42,390
well first of all, I knew
that your show, you could,

186
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:46,980
you could do whatever you want. And,
and was Sheldon Glasgow? It's like,

187
00:11:46,981 --> 00:11:50,490
I usually do an hour or two hours,
but I hung out with this guy,

188
00:11:50,491 --> 00:11:53,560
shut up my whole day
down for six hours. Wow.

189
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:58,600
Just because I was so captivated by him
and he talked about multiple subjects.

190
00:11:58,601 --> 00:12:03,601
So basically I am always got somebody
that I'm really wanting to meet and it's

191
00:12:05,051 --> 00:12:09,700
takes a year at least or
sometimes years to organize this,

192
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:14,590
to get them to say yes or to be in the
same city or be willing to say yes and

193
00:12:14,591 --> 00:12:16,660
meek flight in New York
or some other place.

194
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:21,640
It sounds like you have figured out
the benefit that I've experienced from

195
00:12:21,641 --> 00:12:24,340
having podcasts and having these
kinds of conversations one on one

196
00:12:24,341 --> 00:12:25,174
conversations,

197
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:29,980
but you did it just for your
own personal edification.

198
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:33,460
Yeah, it's, it's kind
of amazing, but it's,

199
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:38,970
I have gotten more out of talking
to people like this and it's,

200
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:41,860
it made me grow more as a person and make,

201
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:45,850
made me understand more
about communication and
how to talk to people than

202
00:12:45,851 --> 00:12:47,260
anything I've ever done in my whole life.

203
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:52,060
Because you don't normally
have this completely unfilled.

204
00:12:52,061 --> 00:12:55,480
It's one of the reasons why I like
headsets as well because it locks you in.

205
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:56,590
It's like your,

206
00:12:56,620 --> 00:13:01,620
your volume of you talking is the same
level in my ears as it is in your ears.

207
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:05,590
We're all on this one. It's not
like there's distance between us.

208
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:09,760
We're in each other's ears and
we're talking, there's no phones,

209
00:13:09,761 --> 00:13:11,770
there's no nothing. We're
sitting across from each other.

210
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:13,660
How would I ever organize this?

211
00:13:13,661 --> 00:13:16,930
I had thought about that with so many
different people that I've had a chance to

212
00:13:16,931 --> 00:13:19,840
talk to. Like how would
I ever get Sean Carroll,

213
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:24,841
the astrophysicist says to sit down and
just talk to me for three hours to count

214
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,150
against him. I would never get him to
do that. I would never get them to, Hey,

215
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:33,270
let's put headphones on and you just
tell me about stuff like explained to me

216
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:35,200
about no one, no one would ever do that.

217
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:38,950
But because of this
thing called the podcast,

218
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:41,590
because I can share it with all the
other people that are listening.

219
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:45,460
I've had this chance to have these kinds
of conversations and it sounds like

220
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:50,500
you've done the same thing, but without
an audience. That's really brilliant.

221
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:55,570
It's a brilliant way that you figured
out that this is a great way to, to,

222
00:13:55,810 --> 00:14:00,810
to expand your own understanding of
people by being one on one with these

223
00:14:00,911 --> 00:14:04,960
brilliant folks. Yes,
exactly. And, and, um,

224
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:09,910
and maybe you do this too,
but I, I've found, I mean,

225
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,650
I do meet a lot of people. I reach out
to me people that are, you know, expert.

226
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:18,370
Um, it's many different things
that I, that I don't do, of course.

227
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,780
But sometimes I just,

228
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:25,330
I become really motivated just to meet
somebody because they're so uniquely

229
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:29,770
committed to something.
They're so obsessed. Yes. Um,

230
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:34,990
and I've even found that I've learned a
lot from Uber drivers and baristas and

231
00:14:34,991 --> 00:14:39,210
stuff where I, um, so I, I,

232
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:41,350
but I do reach out to meet, you know,

233
00:14:41,351 --> 00:14:44,740
people that have really
had a very intense,

234
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:49,670
committed to a really intense
journey and often have triumphed in

235
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:57,620
[inaudible].
