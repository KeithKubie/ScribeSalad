00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:06.160
PROFESSOR: The Whirlwind computer
came online at MIT in 1949.

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:12.400
It occupied 3,300 square feet within a
two-story building, contained 12,500

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:20.360
tubes, 23,803 crystal rectifiers, and
1,800 relays, and consumed 150

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.070
kilowatts of power.

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.490
It was also one of only a handful
of computers on the planet.

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.820
It would have been impossible
to imagine what the next

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.240
decades would bring.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.820
Today, more computational capacity is
manufactured every few milliseconds

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.100
than existed in 1949.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.320
Computational devices have become so
pervasive that most of the time we

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.690
don't even realize that
we are using them.

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.435
Computation keeps our planes in the
air and our cars on the road.

00:00:48.435 --> 00:00:52.020
It manages our electrical,
communication, and financial systems.

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.810
It controls homes and pacemakers.

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:59.560
And perhaps most importantly,
computation has changed the way we

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.590
think about the world.

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.970
Computational thinking has become an
essential tool in engineering,

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.030
science, the social scientists, and
even some branches of humanities.

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.410
In the coming decades neuroscientists
will use computational thinking to

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:17.190
probe the mystery of intelligence.

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.930
Biologists will use computational
techniques to

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.580
understand genes and proteins.

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.160
Climatologists will build computational
models that will help

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.660
man predict the consequences
of societal behaviors.

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.470
Artists will find new ways of using
computation to express their

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.120
creativity.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:40.660
For seven years MIT's EECS department
has taught a course, 6.00, that helped

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:44.600
people who have never programmed learn
to use the computer to help them

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.870
become more productive at whatever
it is they want to do.

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:54.640
That course, and 6.00x, braid together
four strands of material, the basics

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.040
of programming, the Python programming
language, computational thinking and

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.640
modeling, and analysis of data.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:07.010
If you successfully complete 6.00x you
will have learned a language, Python,

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:11.570
for expressing computations, learned a
systematic approach to writing and

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:16.210
debugging medium-sized programs,
developed an informal understanding of

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:20.640
computational complexity, learned a
useful set of algorithmic and problem

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.780
reduction techniques, developed some
insight into the process of moving

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.060
from an ambiguous problem statement to
a computational formulation of a

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.060
method for solving the problem, learned
how to use simulations to shed

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.870
light on problems that don't easily
succumb to closed-form solutions, and

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.190
learned how to use computational tools,
including simple statistical

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.310
and plotting tools to model
and understand data.
