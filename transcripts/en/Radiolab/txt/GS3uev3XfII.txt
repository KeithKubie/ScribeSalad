Speaker 1:          00:49          Hello, I'm Jad album rod and I'm Robert Krulwich. This is radio lab. We're still talking about numbers and now we're going to switch though it'd be it'd be fatigued, some of us, if you think about them a little differently, if you learn to embrace them and give them a bit of a hug, wonderful things can happen. I'm going to introduce you to a m. Well, a nosy man named Mark Nigrini. I'm an associate professor. At the school of business at the College of New Jersey has a really heavy New Jersey accent, but what he really likes to do, what kind of accident was that? It was kind of a, I originally grew up in Cape Town, South Africa. South African. Yes. He likes to play detective and the clues, he looks for numbers. I, I can't walk past the number without just wondering about it. What went into that number? How did it get there?

Speaker 1:          01:40          For example, after I finished filling up at a gas station, sometimes I would just walk around and look at the dollar amounts on the pump. So he peaks in at the pump right next door and it's rather amazing. You can almost tell who's been there before. If you see a number, like a dollar 40 then you know, oh teenager with no money. Why? Wait, explain that. Cause that's all the kid can afford. Quite dry. Sometimes I'll see $10 and 40 cents and I'll say, ah, you meant to do $10 but you are a bit slow today. So you'd go to the gas pumps and they tell you all the [inaudible] little short stories. Yes. And his favorite story that numbers tell actually starts back in 1938 so imagine an office in Schenectady, New York at the GE research laboratories. And in that office is a man and he's sitting at his desk, Mr. Frank Benford and Mr. Frank Benford is a physicist and he's doing some difficult calculations.

Speaker 1:          02:36          I was hunched over a book, probably actually the one of the most boring books you could imagine. This is a book of logarithmic tables, what our luck and with nicotine. So locked tables were a very convenient way of doing multiplication in the early part of the last century. So remember this is before there were calculators. So if you want it to multiply something like a 145 times 3,564 you could just go to this book and look it up. So each starts with numbers. You might want to multiply by one new a hundred on the first page. That 101 hundred and two up to 200 and 300 and the back of the book is like nine hundreds the further you go, the higher and higher the numbers you use to multiply that trade. So our Benford fellow, he's sitting there doing miscalculations and he's looking at the numbers flipping to the bone. He's staring at the pages and notices something kind of weird. United State. The first few pages were more worn than the last few pages, meaning more smudgy and darker and oily as if he was using the front of the book more than the last few pages. And he wondered why is this happening? Strange, not aware of favoring one part of the book over the other. Am I doing something a little? Huh? Or maybe it's something

Speaker 1:          03:54          and that's when it hit him. He thought maybe in this world the are more numbers with loafers, digits and with heifers, digits. What more numbers that start with one or two. The numbers that start with seven, eight or nine yet just because his book is more, that's where, that's what started him thinking. So here's what he did. He compiled some tens of thousands of statistics that Steve Strogatz mathematician at Cornell University, just anything he could think of that was numerical molecular weights of different chemicals, baseball statistics, census data, revenues of all the companies listed on the main stock exchanges in America and everywhere he looked at all these different category it seemed, yes, there were more numbers beginning with one in twos, that eights and nines wait, really? Oh yeah, this has been checked out again and again and again. And it's true, it's eyes of rivers, earthquakes and things like that.

Speaker 1:          04:47          Populations or a number of deaths in a war, areas of counties, stream flow data. What if you were to say, get all the people in New York together and look at their bank accounts, bank account balances, follow Benford's lonely perfectly meaning that if you just look in at the amount of money that people have, matter of fact the in all the Mankins you'll find they begin with one more often than they begin with two perfectly. Yes. So actually they begin with one 30.1% of the time. They'll begin with a to 17.6% of the time, they'll begin with a three 12.5% of the time. That's a big endurance. Why was three DB, I'm sorry, I keep going and the poor nine would only occur as a first digit 4.6% of the time, which actually would make the one approximately six times as likely as the mine and is quite amazing. That is more than quite amazing. That's deeply suspicious. I mean this is crazy what I'm telling you and I can't give you good intuition why it's true. But Steve and mark and mini mini mini map petitions would tell you despite what you may think, there is a preference, a deep preference in the world. It seems for number sequences that start with ones and then twos and then threes. Um, I'm Robert [inaudible] [inaudible] so what,

Speaker 3:          06:05          okay,

Speaker 1:          06:10          well this is not just a mathematical curiosity jad no, no, no. There is something you can do with this information. What? Well, when Mark Nigrini first ran across Benford's law,

Speaker 3:          06:22          he thought, [inaudible],

Speaker 1:          06:24          maybe I can use this law,

Speaker 3:          06:27          the bus

Speaker 1:          06:28          for payroll fraud tax return for you thought, hey, we can use this to catch a thief. That's right, huh? Hello, welcome to green. He figured, if you look at a bunch of numbers that they bank, state minister expense report and so on, and you see that the numbers in the business do not match the natural pattern of Benford's loss, or the numbers don't begin with one's more than the and movie with Twos, one with threes and so on. Then you could say, hey, this is not natural. This may not be true. This may be

Speaker 3:          06:59          fraud.

Speaker 1:          07:01          So he started giving lectures on the idea that Binford is a way to catch thieves. The only problem was they didn't quite believe Benford's law, which means the rest of my talk isn't gonna go anywhere. It is now my great pleasure to introduce you, one of the most fabulous people I've ever had the name to say, Darrow d Durrell [inaudible]. That will be the relativity. I definitely, totally [inaudible] lead or it's an illiterate to literative heaven. It's like Palindromic yeah. Itch Darrell Darell. Oh Wow. And um, but I should say Darryl is, uh, what did he call it? He calls it, I'm a forensic accountant. Forensic Accountant. [inaudible] it means his job is to examine numbers and figures to see if someone is stealing. It's an investigative process. And while at first he was unsure about Benford's law,

Speaker 4:          07:55          but skeptical. One day I happened to talk to one of my neighbors who was a retired statistics professor and he should, oh. Benford I have my students do that proof every year. He actually wrote out the proof for me and it just, it's immutable,

Speaker 1:          08:13          which are your mathematical law. And now it's one of his [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          08:17          favorite tools of his trade. We have a case right now underway, relatively small company, family shareholders. There are four of them. One of them feels like she has been, uh, misrepresented as a shareholder.

Speaker 1:          08:29          Meaning she thinks these other three guys may be stealing. [inaudible] yes. Ah, yes. And I know you can't tell us what this business is doing, but is it a [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          08:38          say a regulated vision?

Speaker 4:          08:45          It's a vision that each of you purchase on a regular basis through your local governmental authority. [inaudible] trash collection or lane. Sure. Anyway, it's one woman thought that she was being cheated, so she's got an attorney involved. The attorney requested data, so we have seven years of income tax returns and that's all he had. Just tax returns [inaudible] yes, so he edited them all into the computer, aggregates them, run Benford's and clicked on the graph. We instantly saw NGO for a couple of the years, coincident with when the dispute began. The way they've reported their taxes violates Benford's very suspicious. Yes. Blew out the Benford's pattern. You mean like there are too many nines on the tax returns? Meaning if you look at the tax returns at this company, you will see a pattern that isn't natural. Exactly. Not enough ones and too many sevens, eights, and nines, but now you have to convince detectives and then lawyers and then judges that this is real evidence of wrongdoing, but they've not heard of this thing. Benford's she don't know about it. As a practical tool has probably been around maybe 10 years, maybe 15 at the outset.

Speaker 4:          09:58          I'm at a conference now with about 700 [inaudible] all of you here, I've spoken four times and each time I've asked about Binford, who's heard of it? Who's familiar with Benford's law? Maybe, maybe 5% of the people. Can you just look at penny a couple observations? To me, it doesn't make sense to exclude the community when your same result and they're asking, do judges allow Ben for the in as evidence suggest that someone's committed a crime there? Case Law out there that actually cite the use of Benford's law and Daryl tells them, oh yeah, yes, you can use this evidence in court. Yes, federal, state and local from the experiences we've had. And then he tells them stories like the case of the CEO stealing money to buy automobile firearms, artwork, jewelry run Benford's you, she, you, you're still in federal prison or the case of the dentist and his wife, she began having an affair with a guy who turned out to be a mess dealer. The dentist suspected her of having dipped into the till run Benford's and boom, busted. She eventually pled or the guy with a $40 million Ponzi scheme run Benford's and well almost boom. I mean, benefits was an element in all these cases. It wasn't the clincher, but still it is a very compelling argument and 10 years from now it'll be the equivalent of a fingerprint.

Speaker 5:          11:30          [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          11:31          that's it. Huh? You still haven't addressed the central mystery here. Why in the world would there be more ones than knives? Shouldn't they be equally, uh, equally coincidence? Yes. Well, the answer is actually very complicated and deeply mathematical. The simple answer is, is there an answer to that? Yes, there is an answer and it has to do, do you understand the answer? No.

Speaker 6:          11:54          I mean, I understand that it has to do with logarithms and the, and the business of doubling and the culture of numbers. But if you were to sit me down and say, explain it to me carefully and, well, I mean, no, it's just too numeric for me to explain it to you. Okay. Alright. But I will now take a little sidestep to a group of people who would be able to explain it to us if they were in this room. But we didn't find them in this room. We found them in, in other rooms. We're rarely in the same room that they are. Yeah. So let's go with our reporter Ben Calhoun and meet a crowd of mathematicians. Ben. Yup. You'd decided to, I don't know what some kind of a busman's holiday you wanted to go to a math conference. I did badly. And what happened?

Speaker 6:          12:37          Well, I went to CUNY, which is the City University of New York, and it was a math conference called it. It was on Combinator tutorial and additive number theory. Oh, a good time. Had by all, yeah. Goes by the, a optimistic acronym camp. So I had heard that if I went to this room, there was going to be a bunch of mathematicians from all over the place, petition from Sweden attending, and they would be able to tell me condoms, college, what their name was, but they would have this other way of identifying themselves. Right. They had this number. My number is two three two yeah, three, three two minus three actually. Oh, nice. Yeah, I'm really excited about it. What, what, what? What is the, what does it mean? I'm okay too. I'm a three. Well, it's an air dish number with an ear dish. Air Dish is a guy.

Speaker 6:          13:30          Oh, so your air dish number is how many steps away you are from this Guy Paul air dish. So you're going to tell me his story. Yup. Hey, you ready? Okay, let me turn off my cell phone so we don't ruin the best take. That's Paul Hoffman. He wrote a book about Paul dish. So we start out in Budapest, Hungary in 1913 it's spring two math teachers have a son named Paul and he had two sisters. They were three and five in the had scarlet fever and they died the day he was born. I mean, imagine that his mother loses her two daughters and gains a son. Oh my God. Yeah. She was so terrified after that that Paul would get a fatal disease and die, that she didn't let him leave the house pretty much for the first 10 years of his life. She didn't let him play with other kids.

Speaker 6:          14:19          Really didn't let him go to school, didn't let him go outside. Also, when he was one and a half, his dad was captured and put in a Soviet prisoner of war camp for six years of his life. So here's this kid at home without other children around. His mother is out teaching mathematics. All the books in the house were math and he taught himself basically to read by looking at these math books. And he also said to me that numbers became my best friends. So I mean, here's a kid who's, you know, whole life has mathematics from the beginning, but let's fast forward. Paul Arish gets his phd in his early twenties this is in the early 1930s [inaudible]. Paul [inaudible] is Jewish, which means he knows the, he's got to get out of Hungary, that he managed to get to the United States, but he has to leave his family behind. When the Nazis moved into Budapest, four of his mother's five siblings were killed. His father died as they were occurred in Jews and trying to move them into the ghetto, and they only had his mother left, but she was in Hungary. And in 1941 Paul dish was at Princeton University. He was just 27 years old, completely cut off from his family. He was lonely and he was homesick. I mean, this guy had no conventional friendships. He had no sexual relationships. His only contact with the girl was the people he worked with.

Speaker 6:          15:53          I mean, that's what's remarkable to me is other people who had been through this kind of life experience might've ended up in a mental institution or worse, but he didn't. He turned this sort of inwardness into making mathematics a joyous and social occasion. He started connecting with people. I don't get this. Like what do you mean? Well, he started traveling. He would hear about somebody who was working on something interesting and he would find a way to get there, show up at their door and he had this phrase that he would say, my brain is open and he was there to work with them on whatever it was that they were working on and he just kept moving mid a circuit of 25 different countries. Eventually he gave up almost all of his possessions and he became essentially homeless. He had no home, he had no home.

Speaker 6:          16:45          So everywhere he went people had to put him up. And as a house guest, the man was an acquired taste. He didn't know how to do basic things. He couldn't cook, he couldn't even boil water for tea. He could barely change his clothes. Your dish didn't know how to tie his own shoes until he was 11 he had some kind of skin condition, so they only wore silk, silk clothes. You had to wash. I mean he went through life this way and there was the schedule. He did mathematics 20 to 22 hours a day. He Bang pots and pans around in the kitchen at 4:00 AM because he wanted you to come downstairs and do more math. So why would anybody want a visit from this guy? This sounds like a walking nightmare. You Cook for him. I stay with him and wash his clothes regardless of his shoes.

Speaker 6:          17:27          Regardless of all of it. You wanted him to come see you. Why? Because he was just that good. This was like God coming to visit you. He knew your strengths, he knew how you thought and it was fascinating to watch him. I mean there were times like I went with him to a math conference and he was there in his hotel room and at one point there were like 10 or 12 in the room. Some are sprawled on his bed, some are sitting on the floor and he'd be working with one for a few minutes and then he would turn to another and then he'd go back to a third and he was working simultaneously with all these people in different problems. Paul Air Dish wrote more papers and collaborated with more people than any other mathematician who's ever lived. He did mathematics with anybody, even if the person was a dim bald. [inaudible] well did mathematics. Now let me just, what's this people can do? This is a Paul air dish on his 80th birthday. That's the only one dovish by an old man. You can save so easy cue of Zane curable disease, a fly surrounded by a lot of the mathematicians who loved him and put him up in their house. We want to express our deep, warm feeling to you and I want wanted to raise your distance for you.

Speaker 5:          18:49          He was a saint,

Speaker 7:          18:52          a singer, a saint.

Speaker 6:          18:55          That's Joel Spencer. He's a mathematician. He was also friends with Paul Paula dish.

Speaker 7:          18:59          Now that he is is gone. I think of him sometimes in a religious context because he, he gave this faith to those of us that are doing mathematics, which after all is if you look at it from the outside, it's a little bit of a strange activity. While you put this enormous effort into finding these these statements,

Speaker 6:          19:24          mathematicians will spend years of their lives trying to prove these things that you know from the outside look totally obscure and pointless.

Speaker 7:          19:34          And yet it was clear working with him that what we were doing was we were trying to find truth with a capital t truth that transcends our physical universe. I think that's the reason why we like to talk about our connection to Paul because our feeling of mathematics, that feeling for what we want mathematics to be Paul Erdish was the embodiment.

Speaker 6:          20:10          Somewhere along the way, mathematicians started keeping track of their connection to Paul air dish and that's what air dish numbers actually are. If you published a paper with Paul [inaudible], your air dish number is one. If you published a paper with someone else and they published a paper with Paul Ordish, then your Erdish numbers two and so on and so on. So this is like all the people that Paul ear additions some way has touched all the people who are connected to him through their ideas.

Speaker 8:          20:38          There are about 500 people with [inaudible] number one and about 8,000 people with their, just number two. This

Speaker 6:          20:45          is professor Jerry Grossman at the University of Oakland in Michigan. And what he did was he took each ring of erudition numbers and he charted it out.

Speaker 8:          20:55          Heritage number three has about 34,000 people in it, uh, 84,000 with their addition number four, then they start decreasing

Speaker 6:          21:05          44,000 that's a lot of people. So if you go ring upon ring upon ring and you and you do the whole deal, like how many people did this man in the end influence,

Speaker 8:          21:14          I think it's about 200,000 mathematicians.

Speaker 6:          21:17          200,000

Speaker 5:          21:20          [inaudible]

Speaker 9:          21:21          200,000 picture that for a second. It's like a solar system with more than 200,000 mathematicians all orbiting around Paul Air Dish

Speaker 10:         21:38          [inaudible]

Speaker 11:         21:39          and your air dish number is one it yes, Dennis Eichorn is a number two and your dish number is two. I wrote a paper with, uh, my advisor and the other students, and she had written a paper with a mathematician who had written a paper with my oldest number is three. Your erudition number is one. And everybody with heritage number one knows that they've got that post. Everybody in this room knows their numbers. I would be very surprised if Kara

Speaker 5:          22:21          [inaudible],

Speaker 6:          22:22          Ben Calhoun's erudition number is oh 0.5778 dash minus one radical six coming up, a story from our friend Steve Strogatz, the mathematician from Cornell, who tells about a friendship. He has a very precious friendship with his math teacher. So it's all about mathematician, but this is a very unusual friendship. And Chad Abu [inaudible], I'm Robert Krulwich sticking around.
