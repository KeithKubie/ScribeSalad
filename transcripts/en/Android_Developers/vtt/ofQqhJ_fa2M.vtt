&gt;&gt; ERIC: Hi, I'm Eric and I'm on the Android
Framework team. I want to show you two features

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.900
right now. My actual favorite feature of the
device is that it has a GPS. So if you take

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:14.550
a picture, then it’s automatically tagged
with where you took it so you don’t have

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:20.259
to remember. But what I want to show you right
now is cut and paste in text. So if there’s

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:23.619
some text that you want to copy from one place
to another, you just long press on where it

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:29.050
is, select “Copy,” move to where you want
it, long press again, and “Paste.”
