CHRISTOPHER L. EISGRUBER:
For the members of our campus

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:16.510
community, this station is an
important link to the Princeton

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.420
Junction Station, and from
there the rest of the country

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:21.940
and a lot of the world.


00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:25.350
I myself have been riding the
Dinky since my student days--

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.540
which, alas, I confess were
now more than 30 years ago--

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.860
and I continue to ride it today.


00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:34.530
While the opening of the station
is an important milestone

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.570
in the Arts and Transit
Project, much work

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.430
is still to be done to
complete that project.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.350
I hope you will join
us in looking forward

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.080
to the completion of a
project that will animate

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.170
this neighborhood with
a glorious combination

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.640
of artistic and communal spaces.


00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:52.140
Thank you.


00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.110
It's a pleasure to
be with you today.

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.240
Wonderful to celebrate the
opening of the facility.

LIZ LEMPERT: The Dinky may be
the shortest scheduled commuter

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:07.800
rail line in the
United States, but it

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.500
has a long and storied history.


00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.860
It's become the
unofficial symbol--

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.120
not just of the university,
but of the town.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.170
We love our Dinky.


00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.000
We're passionate
about our Dinky.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.760
And we believe in the
importance of public transit

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.880
and the vital connection it
provides for all Princetonians.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.290
And we stand here today,
eager to work in partnership

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.230
with the university, the New
Jersey Transit, and the state

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:39.480
to ensure that this new
chapter for the Dinky

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.430
is going to be its most
successful one yet.

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.410
Thank you.

LYDIA CORNETT: I'm from
Baltimore, Maryland,

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.730
and I use the Dinky.


00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:57.660
I do Princeton,
Trenton to Baltimore,

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.140
so I use it pretty
much all the time.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.300
I think the new station's
really cool-- very futuristic.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.130
And I appreciate the
heated waiting room.

KEMY LIN: I'm a
senior in art history.

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.990
We actually take lots of
trips to visit art museums

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:13.450
and galleries in
New York, so it'll

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.880
be wonderful to stop
at the new station.

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.300
And we can grab food
from the Wawa right

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.460
before we get on the
train-- very convenient.

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.040
And I'm really excited about
the architecture as well.
