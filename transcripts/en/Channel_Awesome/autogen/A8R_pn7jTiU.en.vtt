00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:36.710 align:start position:0%
stuff like that so it
 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:40.120 align:start position:0%
stuff like that so it
we<00:02:36.800><c> kind</c><00:02:37.040><c> of</c><00:02:37.130><c> you</c><00:02:37.550><c> know</c><00:02:38.080><c> press</c><00:02:39.080><c> depress</c><00:02:39.920><c> the</c>

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 align:start position:0%
we kind of you know press depress the
 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.540 align:start position:0%
we kind of you know press depress the

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 align:start position:0%
the trigger and it kind of works and
 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.360 align:start position:0%
the trigger and it kind of works and
then<00:02:43.550><c> as</c><00:02:43.670><c> the</c><00:02:43.790><c> piece</c><00:02:44.000><c> of</c><00:02:44.320><c> I</c><00:02:45.320><c> think</c><00:02:46.190><c> it</c><00:02:46.310><c> was</c>

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 align:start position:0%
then as the piece of I think it was
 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.520 align:start position:0%
then as the piece of I think it was
maybe<00:02:46.520><c> aluminum</c><00:02:47.000><c> strapped</c><00:02:47.300><c> that</c><00:02:47.570><c> I</c><00:02:47.840><c> used</c><00:02:48.230><c> for</c>

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 align:start position:0%
maybe aluminum strapped that I used for
 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.820 align:start position:0%
maybe aluminum strapped that I used for

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 align:start position:0%
the trigger guard and screwed it in and
 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.370 align:start position:0%
the trigger guard and screwed it in and
then<00:02:51.980><c> the</c><00:02:52.100><c> barrel</c><00:02:52.460><c> consists</c><00:02:53.330><c> of</c><00:02:53.600><c> a</c><00:02:54.050><c> piece</c><00:02:54.230><c> of</c>

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 align:start position:0%
then the barrel consists of a piece of
 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:59.080 align:start position:0%
then the barrel consists of a piece of

time at my old job and I thought they
 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.830 align:start position:0%
time at my old job and I thought they
kind<00:03:21.050><c> of</c><00:03:21.080><c> look</c><00:03:21.230><c> cool</c><00:03:21.470><c> and</c><00:03:22.030><c> be</c><00:03:23.030><c> a</c><00:03:23.060><c> good</c><00:03:23.240><c> part</c><00:03:23.540><c> to</c>

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 align:start position:0%
kind of look cool and be a good part to
 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.330 align:start position:0%
kind of look cool and be a good part to

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 align:start position:0%
something else and so that was just the
 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.450 align:start position:0%
something else and so that was just the

know a bunch of got a piece of brass
 

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:08.830 align:start position:0%
know a bunch of got a piece of brass
elbow<00:04:05.600><c> there</c><00:04:06.760><c> but</c><00:04:07.760><c> that</c><00:04:07.910><c> was</c><00:04:08.030><c> it</c><00:04:08.210><c> it</c><00:04:08.360><c> was</c><00:04:08.450><c> just</c>

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 align:start position:0%
elbow there but that was it it was just
 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.500 align:start position:0%
elbow there but that was it it was just
kind<00:04:09.410><c> of</c><00:04:09.440><c> an</c><00:04:09.590><c> organic</c><00:04:10.040><c> process</c><00:04:10.220><c> I</c><00:04:10.670><c> was</c><00:04:11.210><c> finding</c>

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510 align:start position:0%
kind of an organic process I was finding
 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:12.700 align:start position:0%
kind of an organic process I was finding
parts<00:04:11.900><c> and</c><00:04:12.050><c> I</c><00:04:12.080><c> thought</c><00:04:12.230><c> then</c><00:04:12.410><c> this</c><00:04:12.530><c> is</c><00:04:12.650><c> the</c>

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:12.710 align:start position:0%
parts and I thought then this is the
 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:15.130 align:start position:0%
parts and I thought then this is the
cool<00:04:12.890><c> I</c><00:04:12.920><c> think</c><00:04:13.160><c> I</c><00:04:13.370><c> could</c><00:04:13.520><c> use</c><00:04:13.640><c> this</c><00:04:13.850><c> and</c><00:04:14.150><c> I</c><00:04:15.080><c> just</c>

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:15.140 align:start position:0%
cool I think I could use this and I just
 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:16.990 align:start position:0%
cool I think I could use this and I just
kind<00:04:15.470><c> of</c><00:04:15.500><c> cobbled</c><00:04:15.890><c> it</c><00:04:15.950><c> together</c><00:04:16.100><c> and</c><00:04:16.610><c> yeah</c><00:04:16.760><c> he</c>

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 align:start position:0%
kind of cobbled it together and yeah he
 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.120 align:start position:0%
kind of cobbled it together and yeah he
just<00:04:17.150><c> repurposed</c><00:04:17.690><c> them</c><00:04:18.020><c> and</c><00:04:18.350><c> you</c><00:04:18.770><c> know</c><00:04:18.890><c> give</c>

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 align:start position:0%
just repurposed them and you know give
 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.250 align:start position:0%
just repurposed them and you know give
him<00:04:19.190><c> another</c><00:04:19.280><c> paint</c><00:04:19.790><c> job</c><00:04:20.000><c> and</c><00:04:20.420><c> it</c><00:04:20.750><c> becomes</c><00:04:21.020><c> a</c>

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 align:start position:0%
him another paint job and it becomes a
 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.730 align:start position:0%
him another paint job and it becomes a

did a little bit more kind of
 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:34.060 align:start position:0%
did a little bit more kind of
freestyling<00:04:33.110><c> I</c><00:04:33.230><c> guess</c><00:04:33.410><c> on</c><00:04:33.530><c> this</c><00:04:33.650><c> one</c><00:04:33.830><c> though</c>

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.070 align:start position:0%
freestyling I guess on this one though
 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.850 align:start position:0%

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:43.980 align:start position:0%
yeah the little the top piece is
 

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:46.340 align:start position:0%
yeah the little the top piece is

actually another electrical connector

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:50.460 align:start position:0%
box and this time I mean I just kind of
 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.360 align:start position:0%
box and this time I mean I just kind of
glued<00:05:51.150><c> some</c><00:05:51.360><c> pieces</c><00:05:51.960><c> on</c><00:05:52.260><c> to</c><00:05:52.500><c> it</c><00:05:52.650><c> the</c><00:05:52.890><c> back</c><00:05:53.070><c> is</c>

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:53.370 align:start position:0%
glued some pieces on to it the back is
 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:56.450 align:start position:0%
glued some pieces on to it the back is
again<00:05:53.790><c> some</c><00:05:54.030><c> washers</c><00:05:54.480><c> just</c><00:05:55.290><c> done</c><00:05:55.500><c> different</c>

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:56.460 align:start position:0%
again some washers just done different
 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.130 align:start position:0%
again some washers just done different

00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:58.140 align:start position:0%

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:03.140 align:start position:0%

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:05.840 align:start position:0%
reduction and the trigger actually is
like<00:06:03.420><c> a</c><00:06:03.740><c> keychain</c><00:06:04.740><c> that</c><00:06:05.190><c> kind</c><00:06:05.430><c> of</c><00:06:05.460><c> depressed</c>

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:09.780 align:start position:0%
in it so then I sculpted the trigger
 

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:13.040 align:start position:0%
in it so then I sculpted the trigger
itself<00:06:10.260><c> and</c><00:06:10.700><c> inserted</c><00:06:11.700><c> it</c><00:06:11.820><c> into</c><00:06:11.970><c> the</c><00:06:12.690><c> wooden</c>

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:13.050 align:start position:0%

head comes out here and and so it
 

00:10:27.949 --> 00:10:29.740 align:start position:0%
head comes out here and and so it
basically<00:10:28.040><c> comes</c><00:10:28.490><c> up</c><00:10:28.639><c> to</c><00:10:28.730><c> like</c><00:10:28.880><c> here</c><00:10:29.389><c> like</c><00:10:29.600><c> my</c>

or something like that and I was like I
gotta<00:10:59.779><c> build</c><00:10:59.990><c> a</c><00:11:00.139><c> spacesuit</c><00:11:01.069><c> around</c><00:11:01.819><c> this</c><00:11:02.000><c> dome</c>

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:02.410 align:start position:0%
gotta build a spacesuit around this dome
 

00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:08.759 align:start position:0%
gotta build a spacesuit around this dome
so<00:11:03.410><c> initially</c><00:11:04.220><c> what</c><00:11:04.790><c> I</c><00:11:04.850><c> did</c><00:11:06.670><c> so</c><00:11:07.670><c> initially</c>

00:11:08.759 --> 00:11:08.769 align:start position:0%
so initially what I did so initially
 

00:11:08.769 --> 00:11:11.759 align:start position:0%
so initially what I did so initially
this<00:11:09.769><c> was</c><00:11:10.040><c> actually</c><00:11:10.250><c> I</c><00:11:10.430><c> just</c><00:11:10.670><c> got</c><00:11:10.970><c> another</c>

00:11:11.759 --> 00:11:11.769 align:start position:0%
this was actually I just got another
 

00:11:11.769 --> 00:11:16.900 align:start position:0%
this was actually I just got another
planter<00:11:12.769><c> and</c><00:11:13.959><c> cut</c><00:11:14.959><c> it</c><00:11:15.220><c> so</c><00:11:16.220><c> that</c><00:11:16.370><c> it</c><00:11:16.490><c> would</c><00:11:16.639><c> fit</c>

00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:16.910 align:start position:0%
planter and cut it so that it would fit
 

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:20.350 align:start position:0%
planter and cut it so that it would fit
like<00:11:17.720><c> this</c><00:11:18.350><c> and</c><00:11:18.740><c> then</c><00:11:18.829><c> I</c><00:11:18.920><c> was</c><00:11:19.010><c> gonna</c><00:11:19.130><c> add</c><00:11:19.490><c> stuff</c>

00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:20.360 align:start position:0%
like this and then I was gonna add stuff
 

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:21.140 align:start position:0%
like this and then I was gonna add stuff
to<00:11:20.390><c> it</c>

00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:21.150 align:start position:0%
to it
 

00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:24.440 align:start position:0%
to it
I<00:11:21.210><c> would</c><00:11:21.420><c> have</c><00:11:21.540><c> to</c><00:11:21.690><c> have</c><00:11:21.900><c> some</c><00:11:22.110><c> kind</c><00:11:22.140><c> of</c><00:11:23.420><c> way</c><00:11:24.420><c> to</c>

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:24.450 align:start position:0%
I would have to have some kind of way to
 

00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:26.690 align:start position:0%
I would have to have some kind of way to
reduce<00:11:24.960><c> it</c><00:11:25.170><c> so</c><00:11:25.470><c> that</c><00:11:25.620><c> the</c><00:11:25.800><c> dome</c><00:11:26.100><c> would</c><00:11:26.280><c> fit</c><00:11:26.550><c> on</c>

00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:26.700 align:start position:0%
reduce it so that the dome would fit on
 

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:29.210 align:start position:0%
reduce it so that the dome would fit on
top<00:11:26.910><c> of</c><00:11:27.090><c> this</c><00:11:27.210><c> and</c><00:11:27.990><c> that</c><00:11:28.770><c> was</c><00:11:28.860><c> in</c><00:11:28.950><c> the</c><00:11:29.010><c> process</c>

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:29.220 align:start position:0%
top of this and that was in the process
 

00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:32.270 align:start position:0%
top of this and that was in the process
of<00:11:29.520><c> making</c><00:11:29.880><c> this</c><00:11:30.570><c> be</c><00:11:30.990><c> the</c><00:11:31.230><c> top</c><00:11:31.560><c> her</c><00:11:31.740><c> the</c><00:11:31.920><c> suit</c>

00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:32.280 align:start position:0%
of making this be the top her the suit
 

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:34.580 align:start position:0%
of making this be the top her the suit
and<00:11:32.550><c> I</c><00:11:32.880><c> realized</c><00:11:33.240><c> I</c><00:11:33.360><c> needed</c><00:11:33.600><c> to</c><00:11:33.660><c> get</c><00:11:34.110><c> something</c>

00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:34.590 align:start position:0%
and I realized I needed to get something
 

00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:37.940 align:start position:0%
and I realized I needed to get something
that<00:11:34.770><c> would</c><00:11:35.120><c> connect</c><00:11:36.120><c> the</c><00:11:36.210><c> dome</c><00:11:36.540><c> to</c><00:11:36.780><c> it</c><00:11:36.930><c> so</c><00:11:37.920><c> I</c>

00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:37.950 align:start position:0%
that would connect the dome to it so I
 

00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:40.720 align:start position:0%
that would connect the dome to it so I
was<00:11:38.070><c> gonna</c><00:11:38.160><c> go</c><00:11:38.400><c> to</c><00:11:38.460><c> a</c><00:11:38.850><c> party</c><00:11:39.390><c> store</c><00:11:39.660><c> and</c><00:11:39.990><c> get</c>

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:40.730 align:start position:0%
was gonna go to a party store and get
 

00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:44.720 align:start position:0%
was gonna go to a party store and get

just a cheap punch bowl and cut out the
top<00:11:44.940><c> and</c><00:11:45.180><c> then</c><00:11:45.930><c> use</c><00:11:46.140><c> that</c><00:11:46.380><c> and</c><00:11:46.680><c> I</c><00:11:46.710><c> could</c><00:11:46.860><c> stick</c>

00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
top and then use that and I could stick

that<00:14:13.360><c> kind</c><00:14:14.230><c> of</c><00:14:14.320><c> prompted</c><00:14:14.980><c> me</c><00:14:15.160><c> to</c><00:14:15.570><c> further</c><00:14:16.570><c> the</c>

00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:16.870 align:start position:0%
that kind of prompted me to further the
 

00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:22.650 align:start position:0%
that kind of prompted me to further the
design<00:14:17.230><c> and</c><00:14:17.680><c> make</c><00:14:18.540><c> some</c><00:14:20.580><c> more</c><00:14:21.660><c> dieselpunk</c>

00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:22.660 align:start position:0%
design and make some more dieselpunk
 

00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:26.790 align:start position:0%

it's really hard to key so I would
 

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:50.290 align:start position:0%
it's really hard to key so I would

00:17:50.290 --> 00:17:50.300 align:start position:0%
recommend possibly dirtying up a bit if
 

00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:52.120 align:start position:0%
recommend possibly dirtying up a bit if
you're<00:17:50.420><c> gonna</c><00:17:50.540><c> shoot</c><00:17:50.810><c> stuff</c><00:17:51.080><c> doing</c><00:17:51.860><c> green</c>

00:19:32.210 --> 00:19:32.220 align:start position:0%
want and it's really cheap being I did I

want and it's really cheap being I did I
again<00:19:32.909><c> I</c><00:19:32.940><c> was</c><00:19:33.230><c> trying</c><00:19:34.230><c> to</c><00:19:34.289><c> build</c><00:19:34.530><c> it</c><00:19:34.679><c> but</c><00:19:35.070><c> it's</c>

again I was trying to build it but it's
very<00:19:35.250><c> little</c><00:19:35.669><c> to</c><00:19:35.850><c> no</c><00:19:35.970><c> money</c><00:19:36.710><c> so</c><00:19:37.710><c> I</c><00:19:37.740><c> think</c><00:19:37.830><c> that</c>

00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:38.130 align:start position:0%
very little to no money so I think that
 

00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:39.680 align:start position:0%
very little to no money so I think that
that's<00:19:38.309><c> ensuring</c><00:19:38.700><c> helmet</c><00:19:38.940><c> was</c><00:19:39.059><c> maybe</c><00:19:39.270><c> like</c><00:19:39.450><c> 12</c>

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:39.690 align:start position:0%
that's ensuring helmet was maybe like 12
 

00:19:39.690 --> 00:19:42.919 align:start position:0%
that's ensuring helmet was maybe like 12

00:19:49.370 --> 00:19:49.380 align:start position:0%
it a little bit so I wound up cutting
 

00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:51.409 align:start position:0%
it a little bit so I wound up cutting

feel<00:20:23.130><c> and</c><00:20:23.429><c> the</c><00:20:23.970><c> back</c><00:20:24.150><c> is</c><00:20:24.360><c> craft</c><00:20:24.600><c> foam</c><00:20:24.809><c> I</c><00:20:25.110><c> have</c><00:20:25.740><c> a</c>

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:25.770 align:start position:0%
feel and the back is craft foam I have a
 

00:20:25.770 --> 00:20:29.020 align:start position:0%
feel and the back is craft foam I have a
kind<00:20:26.039><c> of</c><00:20:26.159><c> just</c><00:20:27.140><c> several</c><00:20:28.140><c> pieces</c><00:20:28.320><c> that</c><00:20:28.530><c> I</c><00:20:28.620><c> glued</c>

00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:29.030 align:start position:0%
kind of just several pieces that I glued
 

00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:33.169 align:start position:0%
kind of just several pieces that I glued
and<00:20:30.030><c> that</c><00:20:30.240><c> sort</c><00:20:30.539><c> of</c><00:20:30.710><c> reduces</c><00:20:31.909><c> the</c><00:20:32.909><c> helmet</c>

00:20:33.169 --> 00:20:33.179 align:start position:0%
and that sort of reduces the helmet
 

00:20:33.179 --> 00:20:34.820 align:start position:0%
and that sort of reduces the helmet
kinda<00:20:33.360><c> brings</c><00:20:33.570><c> it</c><00:20:33.720><c> back</c><00:20:33.929><c> in</c><00:20:34.230><c> and</c><00:20:34.409><c> makes</c><00:20:34.710><c> it</c><00:20:34.799><c> a</c>

00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:34.830 align:start position:0%
kinda brings it back in and makes it a
 

00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:37.130 align:start position:0%
kinda brings it back in and makes it a
little<00:20:34.890><c> bit</c><00:20:35.039><c> more</c><00:20:35.190><c> form-fitting</c><00:20:35.549><c> and</c><00:20:36.330><c> then</c>

00:20:37.130 --> 00:20:37.140 align:start position:0%
little bit more form-fitting and then
 

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:41.899 align:start position:0%
little bit more form-fitting and then
again<00:20:37.500><c> using</c><00:20:38.070><c> some</c><00:20:39.020><c> craft</c><00:20:40.020><c> or</c><00:20:40.289><c> some</c><00:20:40.700><c> this</c><00:20:41.700><c> is</c><00:20:41.760><c> a</c>

00:20:41.899 --> 00:20:41.909 align:start position:0%
again using some craft or some this is a
 

00:20:41.909 --> 00:20:44.510 align:start position:0%
again using some craft or some this is a
foam<00:20:42.179><c> man</c><00:20:42.480><c> actually</c><00:20:42.960><c> that</c><00:20:43.350><c> I</c><00:20:43.380><c> built</c><00:20:43.919><c> the</c><00:20:44.130><c> jaw</c>

00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:44.520 align:start position:0%
foam man actually that I built the jaw
 

00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:47.480 align:start position:0%
foam man actually that I built the jaw
piece<00:20:44.820><c> out</c><00:20:45.030><c> of</c><00:20:45.890><c> its</c><00:20:46.890><c> kind</c><00:20:47.070><c> of</c><00:20:47.100><c> falling</c><00:20:47.309><c> apart</c>

00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:47.490 align:start position:0%
piece out of its kind of falling apart
 

00:20:47.490 --> 00:20:52.940 align:start position:0%
piece out of its kind of falling apart
now<00:20:47.940><c> but</c><00:20:49.789><c> it</c><00:20:50.789><c> would</c><00:20:50.909><c> snap</c><00:20:51.240><c> in</c><00:20:51.419><c> like</c><00:20:51.600><c> that</c><00:20:51.809><c> and</c><00:20:52.289><c> I</c>

00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:52.950 align:start position:0%
now but it would snap in like that and I
 

00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:57.700 align:start position:0%
now but it would snap in like that and I
had<00:20:53.190><c> the</c><00:20:53.580><c> the</c><00:20:54.480><c> chin</c><00:20:55.049><c> piece</c><00:20:55.230><c> actually</c><00:20:55.770><c> has</c><00:20:56.039><c> a</c>

00:20:57.700 --> 00:20:57.710 align:start position:0%
had the the chin piece actually has a
 

00:20:57.710 --> 00:21:00.260 align:start position:0%
had the the chin piece actually has a
elastic<00:20:58.710><c> strap</c><00:20:59.039><c> I</c><00:20:59.309><c> had</c><00:20:59.549><c> the</c><00:20:59.669><c> to</c><00:20:59.789><c> it</c><00:20:59.909><c> so</c><00:21:00.030><c> I</c><00:21:00.090><c> could</c>

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:00.270 align:start position:0%
elastic strap I had the to it so I could
 

00:21:00.270 --> 00:21:01.850 align:start position:0%
elastic strap I had the to it so I could
talk<00:21:00.510><c> and</c><00:21:00.750><c> stuff</c><00:21:00.900><c> like</c><00:21:01.049><c> that</c><00:21:01.260><c> I</c><00:21:01.380><c> wasn't</c>

00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:01.860 align:start position:0%
talk and stuff like that I wasn't
 

00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:04.669 align:start position:0%
talk and stuff like that I wasn't
restricted<00:21:02.309><c> but</c><00:21:03.150><c> it</c><00:21:03.240><c> also</c><00:21:03.360><c> was</c><00:21:03.690><c> still</c><00:21:04.440><c> held</c>

00:21:04.669 --> 00:21:04.679 align:start position:0%
restricted but it also was still held
 

00:21:04.679 --> 00:21:07.220 align:start position:0%
restricted but it also was still held
its<00:21:04.860><c> shape</c><00:21:05.130><c> and</c><00:21:05.340><c> its</c><00:21:05.490><c> form</c><00:21:05.789><c> and</c><00:21:06.059><c> then</c><00:21:06.659><c> I</c><00:21:06.929><c> could</c>

00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:07.230 align:start position:0%
its shape and its form and then I could
 

00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:08.840 align:start position:0%
its shape and its form and then I could
also<00:21:07.350><c> talk</c><00:21:07.710><c> and</c><00:21:07.950><c> it</c><00:21:08.010><c> would</c><00:21:08.100><c> move</c><00:21:08.280><c> around</c><00:21:08.460><c> and</c>

00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:08.850 align:start position:0%
also talk and it would move around and
 

00:21:08.850 --> 00:21:11.659 align:start position:0%
also talk and it would move around and
stuff<00:21:09.059><c> like</c><00:21:09.210><c> that</c><00:21:10.220><c> yeah</c><00:21:11.220><c> I</c><00:21:11.250><c> think</c><00:21:11.340><c> that's</c>

00:21:11.659 --> 00:21:11.669 align:start position:0%
stuff like that yeah I think that's
 

00:21:11.669 --> 00:21:13.850 align:start position:0%
stuff like that yeah I think that's
about<00:21:11.909><c> it</c><00:21:11.970><c> for</c><00:21:12.360><c> today</c><00:21:12.960><c> I've</c><00:21:13.320><c> got</c><00:21:13.350><c> a</c><00:21:13.470><c> few</c><00:21:13.530><c> more</c>

00:21:13.850 --> 00:21:13.860 align:start position:0%
about it for today I've got a few more
 

00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:15.169 align:start position:0%
about it for today I've got a few more

00:21:15.169 --> 00:21:15.179 align:start position:0%
pieces and stuff like that but I'll
 

00:21:15.179 --> 00:21:17.659 align:start position:0%
pieces and stuff like that but I'll
probably<00:21:15.390><c> go</c><00:21:15.630><c> into</c><00:21:15.780><c> more</c><00:21:16.230><c> that</c><00:21:16.440><c> next</c><00:21:17.070><c> time</c><00:21:17.220><c> or</c>
