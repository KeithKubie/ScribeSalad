00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:02.830
- [Instructor] Consider the
table with function values

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:07.380
for f of x is equal to x
squared over one minus cosine x

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:10.660
at positive x-values near zero.

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.210
Notice that there is one
missing value in the table.

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:14.850
This is the missing one right here.

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:19.140
Use a calculator to evaluate
f of x at x equals 0.1

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.860
and enter this number in the table

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.120
rounded to the nearest thousandth.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:26.560
From the table, what
does the one-sided limit,

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.280
the limit as x approaches zero

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:29.660
from the positive direction

00:00:31.792 --> 00:00:35.340
of x squared over one minus
cosine of x appear to be?

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.173
So let's see what they did.

00:00:36.173 --> 00:00:39.970
They evaluated when x equals
one, f of x equals 2.175.

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:41.840
When x gets even a little
bit closer to zero,

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:42.900
and once again, we're approaching zero

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.290
from values larger than zero.

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.020
That's what this little
superscript positive tell us.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.900
We're at 0.5, and we're at 2.042.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.600
Then when we get even closer to zero, 0.2,

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.440
f of x is 2.007.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.750
And so I'm guessing when
I'm getting even closer,

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.420
it's gonna be even closer
to two right over here.

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:03.860
But let's verify that.

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:05.263
Get my calculator out.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:11.160
So I wanna evaluate x squared
over one minus cosine of x

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.520
when x is equal to 0.1.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.320
So the first thing I wanna actually,

00:01:19.434 --> 00:01:21.830
let me verify that I'm in radian mode

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.060
'cause otherwise I might
get a strange answer.

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.810
So I am in radian mode.

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.580
And so let me evaluate it.

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.190
So I'm going to have

00:01:32.396 --> 00:01:35.610
0.1 squared over,

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.190
let me do divide it by

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.190
one minus cosine of 0.1.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.550
And this gets me 2.0016.

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:51.830
And let's see, they want us to round

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:53.710
to the nearest thousandth.

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.743
So that'll be 2.002.

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.210
Type that in.

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.510
2.002.

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:05.510
And so it looks like the
limit is approaching two.

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.840
It's not approaching 2.005.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.597
We just crossed 2.005 from 2.007 to 2.002.

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:15.710
So let's check our answer.

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.060
And we got it right.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.190
And I always find it fun
to visualize these things,

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.020
and that's what a graphing
calculator is good for.

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.060
It can actually graph things.

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.170
So let's graph this right over here.

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.840
So go into graph mode.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.760
Let me redefine my function here.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:31.593
So let's see.

00:02:31.593 --> 00:02:36.310
It's going to be x squared
divided by one minus cosine of x.

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.070
And then let me make sure that the range

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:44.920
of my graph is right, so I'm zoomed in

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.860
at the right part that I care about.

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.720
So let me go to the range.

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:50.553
And let's see.

00:02:50.553 --> 00:02:55.260
I care about approaching zero
from the positive direction,

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.840
but as long as I see values around zero,

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.740
I should be fine.

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.690
But I could actually zoom
in a little bit more,

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.640
so I can make them my minimum x-value.

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.740
I don't know, let me make it negative one.

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:10.870
Let me make my maximum x-value.

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.290
The maximum x-value here is one,

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:13.450
but just to get some space here

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:14.400
I'll make this 1.5.

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.210
So the x-scale is one.

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:21.000
Y-minimum, it seems like
we're approaching two.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.520
So the y-max can be
much smaller, let's see.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.090
We'll make y-max three.

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:26.763
And now let's graph this thing.

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.900
So let's see what it's doing.

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.420
It looks like...

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.520
And you see here whether,

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:36.830
and actually it looks like
whether you're approaching

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:39.710
from the positive direction or
from the negative direction,

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:41.040
it looks like you're approaching,

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.470
the value of the function approaches two.

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.380
But this problem, we're
only caring about as we have

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.220
x-values that approaching zero

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.010
from values larger than zero.

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.280
So this is the limit.

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.790
This is the one-sided
limit that we care about

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.473
with the two shows up
right over here as well.
