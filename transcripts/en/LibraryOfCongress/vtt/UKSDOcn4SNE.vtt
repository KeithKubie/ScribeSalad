00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:25.670
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum:
Good afternoon everyone.

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.250
Welcome. So, nice to see you here.

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.160
if anybody is serious about
Afro Cuban music or Latin Jazz,

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.480
then surely you know
the name Machito;

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:43.270
one of the most important band
leaders in American music.

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:50.410
He more or less defines the
genre, especially for this music

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:55.210
in the 1940s, 50s, 60s, and 70s.

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.600
We're going to celebrate his
music and his legacy today.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.780
And, I can't think of
anybody better to help us do

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.070
that than the gentleman
sitting at my right.

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.010 position:56%
If you've been following Latin jazz,

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.520
you know him as a world
famous percussionist.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:13.820
He worked in the studios.

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.540 position:56%
He recorded hundreds maybe thousands
of jingles and commercials.

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.160
But, I've been seeing
him, most recently,

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.380
with Dizzy Gillespie's
Afro Cuban experience.

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.150
In fact, that's when we
first met face to face

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.890
after a performance
at the Kennedy Center.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.470
This is Mario Grillo.

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.960 position:56%
And I, and I use that pronunciation.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.260
&gt;&gt; Mario Grillo: Right.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:40.560
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: Yes.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.370
He took over leadership of the
orchestra after his father died.

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:49.510
And, he's help maintain his legacy.

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.830
Now, we have a special announcement
that we're going to share

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.060
with you in a few minutes.

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.780
And, we hope you're going to
stick around for all of that.

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.960
We'll talk a little bit
about his father's music.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.380
And then, we'll open it up for
any questions you might have.

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.780
We also have some clips
to share with you.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.390
So, I think this will be fun.

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.870
This is being videotaped for
webcast, just so you'll know.

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:17.970
I hope you help me
welcome Mario Grillo.

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.250
&gt;&gt; Mario Grillo: Thank
you for having me here.

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.570
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum:
It's our pleasure.

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:31.790
Now, as I mentioned,
everybody in this room,

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.030 position:56%
I'm guessing, knows Machito's music.

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.350
Let's see a show of hands.

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.690
Oh, good sign.

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:43.420
But, not everybody knows about his
biography, details about his life.

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.560
And, I want to start off by
talking a little bit about that.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.800
Let's establish some
fact first of all.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.680
He was born when and where?

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:59.040
&gt;&gt; Mario Grillo: Machito was born
December 3rd 1908 in Havana Cuba.

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.870
He migrated to New
York City in 1937.

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.900
When he got here, in 1937, he
immediately started working

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.710
with what few bands there were
in New York City at that time.

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:18.260
And, I asked him how he did that
and he said well gigs or, you know,

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:24.800
dances in those days played, paid
$2, you know, $3 for the night.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:30.450
So, he would go to these dances
with $10 in his pocket or 20 bucks.

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.990 position:56%
And, he would go up to the singer or
whatever band it was and say listen,

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:36.670
I'll give you a dollar if
you let me sing a tune.

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.370
And, that's how people
started hearing him and knowing

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.880
who is this Machito person.

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.420
Shortly thereafter, he got

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:51.250
with an incredible Puerto Rican
band leader named Noro Morales

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:52.590
and he joined Noro's band.

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.350
Then, after that, a dear friend

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:58.710
of his named Miguelito Valdez
was working with Xavier Cugat

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:01.430
and decided to leave
and make his own band.

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.680
So, now he goes to Cugat and he
tells him I'm leaving the band

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.200
but I got a guy that can
do the job, you know.

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.890
This guy's dynamite, he can do it.

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:13.190
He said, but, how can that be?

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.650
I'm recording next week.

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.660
You know, there's no way he's
going to learn this new material

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.510
and everything in a week's time.

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.640
No way. He said, no,
don't worry about it.

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.280
This guy will do it.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.410
and, of the tunes that Noro Morales
picked, he picked one, which is,

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.200
which is the standard
called Cachita.

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:38.230
And, that was a block buster hit
sold, I don't know how many copies.

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:43.500
And, from there, you
know, the rest is history.

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.990
He went to work with
a band Alberto Iznaga.

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.040
And, Estrellas Habaneras.

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:56.170 position:56%
And, like all musicians do, and we
still do it today, you pirate a band

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:58.200
out of the band that you're in.

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.720
So then, he took the bass
player, the piano player,

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.440
the trumpet player,
the sax, you know,

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:06.480
he took like the entire
band and made his own band.

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:12.670
And, his first arranger was
Jose Madera Sr., Pin Madera.

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:16.680
He had his own band in 39.

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.350
But then, in 1940, my beloved uncle

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:25.160
and namesake Mario Bauza was
musical director with Chick Webb,

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:32.180
he had gone with Cab Calloway,
Noble Sissel, the Missourians,

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:33.660
all these kind of crazy stuff.

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:36.170
And, he tells my father,
you know, Machito,

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:37.730
I want to stay in New York, man.

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:39.730
I don't, I don't want
to keep traveling.

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:43.900
You know, I want to be
in this city permanently.

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:48.410
And, they reorganized
the orchestra again.

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:51.520
Well, when Mario came to the
band, he came with this idea

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:57.250
and this concept of
taking a big band concept,

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:01.190
a big band jazz concept
but put a Latin rhythm,

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:04.040
and Afro Cuban rhythm
section underneath it.

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:08.350
From there came things like
tanga, later on Dizzy Gillespie

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:11.450
which [inaudible] Monteca.

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:13.420 position:56%
These were the ground breaking tunes

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:18.520
which established what then they
called the Cubop period along bop

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:20.090
and bebop period.

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:25.910
I would say that 95% of the work
that Machito did was in jazz clubs,

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:30.620
you know, like the Birdland and
the Royal Goose and Bop City,

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:32.520
different places like that.

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:36.060
He did do the Latin scene,
so to speak, Chateau Madrid

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:38.260
and things along those lines.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:43.450
But, it always tended to be
more of a jazz side to the band.

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:45.740
Mr. Appelbaum was asking
me, and I was telling him

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:48.670
about this whole thing about
Machito and these Afro Cubans.

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:51.520
Okay, people would ask him
Machito who are your Afro Cubans?

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:55.380
He goes okay, you know, Mark
Freedman, Ken Hitchcock, you know,

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:59.320
Leslie, I mean, his thing was
he didn't need Afro Cubans.

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:01.860
What he needed was musician,

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:04.080
guys who came with that
big band experience.

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.940
Many of the guys that
came to our band had come

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:10.250 position:56%
out of Duke Ellington's and Woody
Herman's band and Buddy Rich's band,

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:11.950
Thad Jones Mel Lewis Orchestra.

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:15.030
So, they already came prepared.

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:19.920
The only thing that was always
difficult was to find that clave,

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:22.350
to be able to connect
with that clave.

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:24.400
But, a couple of challenges
very easy.

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:25.980
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: Can
I just ask you quickly,

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:28.250
for anybody watching this webcast?

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:29.550
What is clave.

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:32.270
&gt;&gt; Mario Grillo: What clave is a
two-part phrase, four-part phrase,

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:34.390
you know, it can either
be three two or two three.

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:36.190
So, it can be.

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:41.570
[ Singing notes ]

00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:43.510
Or you can reverse it to.

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:49.070
[ Singing notes ]

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:52.770
That's where you get the
prescription from dancers who say

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:57.120
that they dance on two, you
know, and it's because of the way

00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:00.730
that the clave falls in
that rhythmic patter.

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:03.680 position:56%
But, I was telling [inaudible] that,
you know, clave isn't everything.

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:05.510
You know, Beethoven's
5th is in clave.

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:16.620
[ Singing notes ]

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:18.570
That's in clave.

00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:23.400
So, it's, nothing new.

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:26.340
But, it certainly is the
core of what we play.

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:28.650
It's a very clave driven music.

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:31.520
I can't play out of clave.

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:32.820
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum:
It's the heartbeat.

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:34.120
&gt;&gt; Mario Grillo: It's the heart.

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:35.420
It's the pulse.

00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:39.150
And, I have found that
I, I've given up.

00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:43.660
I can't. I just, I'll just
like bluff around when

00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:46.510
that jump comes, you know, so.

00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:50.040
[ Singing notes ]

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:55.120
And I'll come, I'll come right
back in again because it's just,

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:59.120 position:56%
I really can't play on a clave, not.

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:03.170
Well, funny thing, working
with Dizzy Gillespie band,

00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:07.540
and more of the jazz format,
the clave is very flexible.

00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:11.290
You know, you can go back and
forth in the middle of a tune.

00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:13.480
I find it tough to do.

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:17.470
It's cool because I, now I look for
it, you know, I'm conscious of it

00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:19.400
and I know when that
jump is going to come.

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:24.930
But, initially, no, I found
it quite difficult to do.

00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:28.170
But, it's just what's within you.

00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:29.470
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: Two quickies.

00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:31.940
Did people call him, as
friends, did they call him Macho?

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:33.240
&gt;&gt; Mario Grillo: Macho.

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:34.540
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: Okay.

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:35.840
&gt;&gt; Mario Grillo: Yeah.

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:37.140
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum:
Nobody called him Frank?

00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:38.440
&gt;&gt; Mario Grillo: No.

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:39.740
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: Or Francesco?

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:41.040
&gt;&gt; Mario Grillo: And,
strangely enough, in our family,

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:42.340
we have some here,
everybody's Frank.

00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:46.990
My brother's Frank, his son is
Frank, my daughter's Francesca,

00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:49.910
my brother-in-law is
Frank, his son is Frank.

00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:56.000
We have another twin Frank that
we call cockeyed Frank, big Frank,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.360
we have Baby Frank, who is Frank
Serrica [assumed spelling],

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:01.890
we have the other Frank
Hartman, whatever.

00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:05.600
So, when you say Frank, in our
house, that, everybody's like,

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:08.750
you know, because there's like
seven, eight, or nine of them.

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:12.320
But, they know who they are by the
tone of your voice, you know, like,

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:17.700
we always like go Frank
Serrica, the baby, we always used

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:22.220 position:56%
to call him Frank the Greek because,
for his first couple of years,

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:25.520
[inaudible], you know, we didn't
know what the heck he was saying.

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:28.620
But, yeah, there's a
whole bunch of Franks.

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:33.800
But, no, Macho, I would think
everybody just called him Macho.

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:35.100
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum:
Speaker of family,

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:36.650
when did he meet your mother Hilda?

00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:39.390
&gt;&gt; Mario Grillo: He met
my mother about 1940.

00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:40.940
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum:
And how did they meet?

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:46.700
&gt;&gt; Mario Grillo: He, well, now
they call them stalkers, in that,

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:48.700
in those days it was a
little different, you know.

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:57.170
He saw this beautiful
girl go by, that was it.

00:10:58.890 --> 00:11:00.750
There's five of us.

00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:02.280
They were pretty busy.

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:12.600
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: And you, in
order of five, which are you?

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:13.900
&gt;&gt; Mario Grillo: Next to last.

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:22.160
It's my sister Martha, my
brother Frank, Barbara, me,

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:27.000
and my little sister Paula.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.300
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: Paula.

00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:29.600
She's a singer.

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:30.900
Yeah?

00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:32.200
&gt;&gt; Mario Grillo: Yes.

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:33.500
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum:
She sang with a band.

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:36.910
&gt;&gt; Mario Grillo: I threw
her out of the band.

00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:40.370
She came to me one day
and asked for a raise.

00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:45.580
And, I didn't think
that was a good idea.

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:48.320
But, she is quite fantastic.

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:50.880
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: Now, you are
a percussionist, as I mentioned.

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:56.670
Did you study your father's music
or was it just around the house?

00:11:56.670 --> 00:12:01.310
&gt;&gt; Mario Grillo: You
know what, it's very sad.

00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:11.550
We didn't listen to daddy's music.

00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:15.560
Why? Here's a guy walking around
in his underwear every day,

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:17.420
I mean, you know.

00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:22.590
He didn't impress us.

00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:30.620
So, we, we didn't know,
we didn't know who he was.

00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:34.880
But, tremendous person.

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:37.430
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: So, you
know, you grew up with this man.

00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:40.910
The world knows him for
his musical contributions.

00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:42.210
&gt;&gt; Mario Grillo: Yeah.

00:12:42.210 --> 00:12:45.490
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: He's a very
important figure around the world.

00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:47.790
And yet, for you, he's
daddy, you know.

00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:49.790
So, at what point did you realize?

00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:51.090
&gt;&gt; Mario Grillo: Never.

00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:52.390
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: Who he was?

00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:54.580
&gt;&gt; Mario Grillo: We still don't.

00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:58.040
No clue.

00:12:58.040 --> 00:12:59.340
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: And yet,

00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:01.880
all the musicians you work
with, they all revere him.

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:03.180
Yes?

00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:06.030
&gt;&gt; Mario Grillo: Well,
because he was a very simple

00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:09.340
and very approachable individual.

00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:19.100
He believed that there should be
no dead chairs in an orchestra.

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:24.280
Meaning, traditionally, it's always
the tenor sax that plays the solos.

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:27.660
It's the third trumpet that
always plays the solos.

00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:29.830
Now, he would turn around
and point to anybody.

00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:33.870
And, I asked him one day,
I said why do you do that?

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:36.510
You know, why does
everybody get to play?

00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:40.530
You know, they're supposed be
soloists in a band, not everybody.

00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:44.920 position:56%
He goes no, because if this, if this
band knows that I'm going to turn

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:49.450
around an point to
them to come up front,

00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:51.920
they're going to practice
their instrument,

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:54.940
they're going to send their
suit to the drycleaner,

00:13:54.940 --> 00:14:00.840 position:56%
they're going to polish their shoes,
they're going to iron they're shirt,

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:03.010
and they're going to be
looking for the opportunity

00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:05.630
when they know they
can come out front

00:14:05.630 --> 00:14:09.970
and let people know
what they can do.

00:14:09.970 --> 00:14:16.020
So, I don't want no dead chairs
in my band everybody plays.

00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:18.310
I do it too.

00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:22.900
I had one guy come in from
Ray Charles orchestra,

00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:24.200
tremendous saxophonist.

00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:28.220
So, in the middle of a turn, you
know, so I turned around I pointed

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:31.900
to him get up there, he
didn't get up, you know.

00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:39.030
Now, I'm playing, you know, I turn
around, he didn't get up, you know.

00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:41.750
So now, we finish the concert.

00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:43.050
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: That's good.

00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:45.330
&gt;&gt; Mario Grillo: We finished
the concert and I go over there

00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:49.830
and say yo bro, I pointed to
you like two or three times.

00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:52.930
He says, yeah I was wondering
why you were pointing at me.

00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:57.620
I told him well I want you to play,
I want you to come up and play.

00:14:57.620 --> 00:15:00.210
He goes, play what?

00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:01.940
A solo man, you play solos.

00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:03.250
Don't you?

00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:08.030
He said, I was in Ray Charles band
five years, I never played a solo.

00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:12.070
I told him I said no man, this
is a different thing here,

00:15:12.070 --> 00:15:13.370
everybody plays.

00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:14.970
So, he goes wow.

00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:16.970
Without skipping a beat,
he says man I'm going

00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:18.510
to send my suit to the cleaners.

00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:28.420
And, you know, it struck me
and I was like, he was right.

00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:34.480
Yeah. So, I do, you know,
everybody gets to play except me.

00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:37.130
I'm not a soloist.

00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:40.880
I used to be, when I was five.

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:43.480
But, I kind of got away from that.

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:45.280
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: Well, you
were playing at a very young age.

00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:46.580
&gt;&gt; Mario Grillo: Yeah.

00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:47.880
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: And, you
were really making records.

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:49.180
&gt;&gt; Mario Grillo: Well,
yeah, yeah, I started.

00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:50.480
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: Image here.

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:54.200 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Mario Grillo: I started playing
in my father's band when I was five.

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:58.570
The, I came into the band
regular when I was 15.

00:15:58.570 --> 00:15:59.870
I was in high school.

00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:01.170
I was a freshman in high school.

00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:04.750
But, I started recording
when I was like 14.

00:16:04.750 --> 00:16:07.070
Daddy used to send me to
the recordings, jingles,

00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:09.970
recording radios commercials,
TV commercials.

00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:11.490
And, that's how I started.

00:16:11.490 --> 00:16:17.090
So, I did a thousand jingles
and commercials and many,

00:16:17.090 --> 00:16:20.410
many recordings of
albums with other artists.

00:16:20.410 --> 00:16:23.380
You know, my wife laughs
because now I've come full circle

00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:27.470
after like 40 years I'm playing
what we call toys again, you know,

00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:30.380
tambourines, shakers,
and claves and things.

00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:32.090
I had gotten away from that.

00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:35.180
But, I've come right back to
that with Dizzy Gillespie Band,

00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:40.250
and it's been incredible, you know,
because it gives you so much more

00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:43.130
to reach for in the
course of a performance.

00:16:43.130 --> 00:16:44.700
So, that's been really nice.

00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:48.060
But then again, you know, again,

00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:50.700
nephecism [assumed spelling]
is a wonderful thing.

00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:56.740
One guy told me, oh man you know
what, the only reason you got

00:16:56.740 --> 00:16:58.490
that band, your father
left you that band.

00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:00.230
I said well what if he
would've had a bodega

00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:04.470
or a dry cleaner, or a supermarket?

00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:06.440
Well, that's what I
would've gotten too.

00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:10.800
Would you, would you be envious if
he would've left me a shoe store

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:12.550
or a, you know, whatever?

00:17:12.550 --> 00:17:13.890
So, I didn't pick.

00:17:13.890 --> 00:17:19.110
If it was up to me, well we
had trouble with that one day.

00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:20.790
Daddy said, well, you
know, you guys are lucky.

00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:25.130
We said yeah we'd be lucky if we
were Rockefellers or Roosevelts

00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:27.570
or Kennedys, we'd have
millions of dollars, you know.

00:17:27.570 --> 00:17:28.870
He goes yeah, yeah, yeah,

00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:30.830
yeah I guess you're right
on that one, you know.

00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:40.730
But, we, we had the same
things anyway and even more.

00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:43.890
So, you know, that's
a pretty good thing.

00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:45.310
we're happy about that.

00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:46.610
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum:
If you don't mind,

00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:49.450
I want to ask a few more
questions about the early days,

00:17:49.450 --> 00:17:54.580
when he forms the Afro Cubans,
we're talking early 1940s, yes.

00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:58.040
And, I'm sure he struggled
as did many immigrants

00:17:58.040 --> 00:17:59.340
who came to this country.

00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:04.230
Yes? And, he writes a song that
becomes a kind of hit for him.

00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:07.980
And, it's about, it's
about this pigeon suit.

00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:09.530
&gt;&gt; Mario Grillo: Yeah,
Sopa de Pichon.

00:18:09.530 --> 00:18:13.140
Well, the Sopa de Pichon,
again, like all Puerto Rican's

00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:15.000
and Cuban's and, you know,

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.890
everything can be remedied
with a chicken soup.

00:18:17.890 --> 00:18:20.060
And, by the same token,
the pigeon soup.

00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:25.410
And, I think my mother
was pregnant at that time.

00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:29.200
And his, tiene que tomar
una sopa de pichon,

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:32.820
para que baile te de expiracion.

00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:34.460
Big hit. Huge.

00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:37.890
But, keep in mind, nobody
was declaring anything

00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:41.370
about Afro anything in 1940.

00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:43.190
So then, to come with an orchestra

00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:50.400
and name it Afro Cubans was
pretty heavy at the time.

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:53.740
And again, that was partially
Machito and also Mario Bauza,

00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:56.490
this thing of, you know, we're
Africans and we're Cubans.

00:18:56.490 --> 00:18:57.790
This is what we play.

00:18:57.790 --> 00:18:59.170
This is the strength of our music.

00:18:59.170 --> 00:19:02.780
So then, why not be proud of that.

00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:04.890
So, that's the name of the band.

00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:09.370
The only time we ever changed
the name, we went to Europe.

00:19:09.370 --> 00:19:14.930
And, our promoter was also
the record company owner.

00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:18.140
So, he says to my father
Machito we're going to record.

00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:22.510
Well, we recorded a Grammy Award
winning album big hoopty do.

00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:26.690
We beat out Jose Light
My Fire, Feliciano.

00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:31.370
Julio Iglesias.

00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:36.040
Well, as a result of us winning,
they changed the categories.

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:39.620
Because, how you going to
spend $5 million on promotion

00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:43.110
for Julio Iglesias
and Machito, I think,

00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:46.710
our record company spent $17.85.

00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:48.010
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: And stamps.

00:19:48.010 --> 00:19:51.000
&gt;&gt; Mario Grillo: And
stamps and manila envelopes.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.210
How can this guy win
and this guy not?

00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:57.010
So, then they changed
it from best Latin album

00:19:57.010 --> 00:20:08.860
to three categories best pop, best
tropical, best some other bologna.

00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:11.110
All I know is that they had
to create more categories

00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:14.750
because the industry
went quite insane.

00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:18.260
The night before the
Grammys, we were in the house

00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:20.390
and we were just hanging
out and whatever

00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:23.040
and we're watching Johnny Carson.

00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:25.420
And, Julio Iglesias was on.

00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:29.720
And, he didn't sing
one tune, he sang two.

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:34.210
Who sings two songs
on Johnny Carson?

00:20:34.210 --> 00:20:38.690
Nobody. So then, I looked at my
father, he looked at me he said,

00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:41.850
you know, what, let's not waste
gas, let's not send anything

00:20:41.850 --> 00:20:43.870
to the cleaners, we're
not going to win.

00:20:43.870 --> 00:20:46.180 position:56%
How can we, how can we possibly win?

00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:50.560
But, Patrice Russian's manager, we
had just been with him here in DC.

00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:52.890
He said Machito, I'm
going to be in the lane.

00:20:52.890 --> 00:20:55.660
So, what I'll do is,
since they announce early,

00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:59.210
I'll call you I'll let you
know if you won or not.

00:20:59.210 --> 00:21:02.970
And, we were like yeah, okay.

00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:05.490
Wouldn't you know,
hey Machito you won.

00:21:05.490 --> 00:21:06.790
He said won what?

00:21:06.790 --> 00:21:08.090
He said you won the
Grammy this year.

00:21:08.090 --> 00:21:09.700
He said you're kidding me.

00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:13.550
Yeah. They'll be calling
you any minute now.

00:21:13.550 --> 00:21:16.190
So now, he got up, he dressed,
he cut himself shaving,

00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:19.360
the whole craziness
and he went downtown.

00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:24.220
And, the one that presented him
the Grammy was a very dear friend

00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:27.860
[inaudible] Maurice Hines
from Hines, Hines, and Dad.

00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:29.160
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: Yeah.

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:32.040
&gt;&gt; Mario Grillo: Worked with us
in place called Concord Hotel,

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:34.700
played 22 summers up there.

00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:38.040
I was the only kid in East Harlem

00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:43.960
that ate cold beef borscht
paid $1 for sour cream.

00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:52.620
My favorite was always Liberace,
just in, pretty incredible.

00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:57.760
But, he started out,
but you know what, he,

00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:02.380 position:56%
as much as he struggled initially,
which everyone does, the product was

00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:08.100
so good that you just couldn't
go wrong with it, you know.

00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:12.660 position:56%
That's why, to this day, I've always
said, when you talk about the big 3,

00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:16.570
you know, Machito, Tito
Puente, Tito Rodriguez,

00:22:16.570 --> 00:22:21.960
you're saying it is the equivalent
of Ford, Chevrolet, General Motors.

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:27.240
It's a brand name,
Hellman's, Hines, you know.

00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:35.680
So, we've been very blessed to
have 75 years of Machito Orchestra.

00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:36.980
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: Now,
those three band leaders

00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:39.110
that you mentioned,
Tito, Tito, and Machito.

00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:40.460
&gt;&gt; Mario Grillo: Tito,
Tito, yeah sure.

00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:41.760
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum:
Were they rivals?

00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:43.060
&gt;&gt; Mario Grillo: Yes.

00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:45.480
But, only on the bandstand.

00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:48.070
They were the dearest of
friends, very good friends.

00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:51.990
And, I asked my father a
very poignant question.

00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:53.590
I said Daddy, let me
ask you a question.

00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:56.440
In the palladium, in the
old days in the palladium,

00:22:56.440 --> 00:23:00.500 position:56%
in the height of all this
hysteria, who did you prefer to play

00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:03.170
with Tito Puente or Tito Rodriguez?

00:23:03.170 --> 00:23:07.260
He said no, I wanted them
both at the same time.

00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:09.470
And, I'm like yeah, why?

00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:12.550
And he said Tito would
beat the crap out of Tito

00:23:12.550 --> 00:23:15.490 position:56%
and Tito would beat the crap out the
Tito, by the time they got to me,

00:23:15.490 --> 00:23:21.770 position:56%
they were exhausted and with ballad,
I'd knock the two of them over.

00:23:21.770 --> 00:23:25.430
And, you know, what, it's very
true because, when I play,

00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:32.100
opposite of bands, my intention,
my thought is in kind of that.

00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:39.210 position:56%
But, my intention's to destroy them,
to run them over like a MAC truck.

00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:45.860
My attitude is take, take, take
no prisoners, just dead people.

00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:50.350
It was, how I was taught.

00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:54.110
That's the way I play.

00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:56.230
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: So I, you
know, we were talking a little bit

00:23:56.230 --> 00:24:00.840
about his early days and the
fact that he establishes himself,

00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:03.280
in the 1940s, as a band leader.

00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:05.620
I don't know how many of
you have actually heard some

00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:06.920
of his earliest recordings.

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:09.740
We all know like the
hits that came later.

00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:14.360
But, I wanted us to hear a little
bit of something from 1940, 41.

00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:18.060
And, we were talking about that
pigeon soup song Sopa de Pichon.

00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:21.510
It's track number 2
on that disk Mike.

00:24:21.510 --> 00:27:32.670
[ Music ]

00:27:32.670 --> 00:27:35.890
So, what do you feel
when you listen to that?

00:27:35.890 --> 00:27:40.840
&gt;&gt; Mario Grillo: Well, the
funny thing about the book,

00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:43.020
there's about a thousand
arrangements.

00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:49.100
I don't know titles as
much as I know numbers

00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:52.280
because the book is numberized.

00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:55.000
Sopa de Pichon, obviously,
one of the first ones,

00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:03.010
is number 25 in the book, Mamba
Win is 317, Cuban Fantasy is 420,

00:28:03.010 --> 00:28:10.080
Zambia is 323, [Inaudible]
is 300, [Inaudible] 521.

00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:14.410
I know numbers but not
so much the titles.

00:28:14.410 --> 00:28:16.710
And, the funny thing about
that is, one day I'm coming

00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:20.900
out of my building in the Bronx and
here comes this guy and he says,

00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:22.200
hey Mario, let me ask
you a question,

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:24.160
that tune that your father
sings, you know, [inaudible] ,

00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:27.090
that's all here, I go that's 341.

00:28:27.090 --> 00:28:29.710
He goes what do you mean 341?

00:28:29.710 --> 00:28:34.130
I said yeah that's Que Bonito
Puerto Rico, 341 in the book.

00:28:34.130 --> 00:28:35.430
He goes that's a good number.

00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:36.730
I told him yeah.

00:28:36.730 --> 00:28:38.540
He played it, it hit.

00:28:38.540 --> 00:28:42.940
Right? So now, I see him
like a couple of days later,

00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:46.820
he tells me yo Mario man, mira,
he said give me 41, you know,

00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:49.790
[inaudible], you know I
hit that 341 number man.

00:28:49.790 --> 00:28:51.750
I told him yeah, cool.

00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:53.680
How much? He said $500.

00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:54.980
I said really?

00:28:54.980 --> 00:28:57.220
Wow man, he said let
me buy you a beer.

00:28:57.220 --> 00:29:03.500
Can you imagine, $500 a beer.

00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:07.050
And, it was a country club,
it wasn't even Budweiser

00:29:07.050 --> 00:29:10.690
or Coors Light or, you know.

00:29:10.690 --> 00:29:11.990
Yeah, numbers.

00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:16.370
One of the biggest fights that I
had with daddy, which, you know,

00:29:16.370 --> 00:29:22.140
as like a week long fight, we used
to travel or he used to travel

00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:28.030 position:56%
with the individual boxes, you know,
every musician had a box of music.

00:29:28.030 --> 00:29:31.440
So, you're lugging around 13 boxes.

00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:34.630
And then, checking into
the airport was insanity.

00:29:34.630 --> 00:29:37.700
So I told him, Daddy, you know
what, we can't be traveling

00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:40.340 position:56%
around with a thousand arrangements.

00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:43.030
This is silly.

00:29:43.030 --> 00:29:47.400
Even if we played two sets,
how many tunes can we play

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:51.040
in two sets, 20, 25?

00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:56.570 position:56%
Let's make a smaller book, you know,
say maybe 50 or 60 arrangements.

00:29:56.570 --> 00:29:59.660
You pick out the ones you like
and that's what we travel with.

00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:04.470 position:56%
He says, yeah, but what if someone
asks me for something we don't have?

00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:09.800
So I'm like, you know what, trust
me, nobody's going to ask you

00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:12.870
for something that you don't have.

00:30:12.870 --> 00:30:14.450
I make the new book.

00:30:14.450 --> 00:30:17.000
I even had, now I'd
probably go to jail

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.990
if I had called McDonnell
Douglas and [inaudible]

00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:26.860
because I wanted the exact
measurement to make a case

00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:30.150
that would fit under
the seat in front of me.

00:30:30.150 --> 00:30:33.340
They don't give that
information anymore.

00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:37.060
But they did 34 years
ago, so I had a box made

00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:38.890
that would fix exactly underneath,

00:30:38.890 --> 00:30:41.490
because you never check
in the music.

00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:46.060
Anyway, we go out on the road,
we're playing gigs, playing gigs,

00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:48.250
playing gigs, everything's
fine, everything's beautiful,

00:30:48.250 --> 00:30:49.550
we're out like four or five weeks,

00:30:49.550 --> 00:30:51.150
everything's swinging,
bup, bup, bup, bup.

00:30:51.150 --> 00:30:57.300
Here comes some banana and
says, oh, yeah, Machito,

00:30:57.300 --> 00:30:58.600
[ Speaking Spanish ]

00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:08.230
, and he turned around and
he looked at me, and he says,

00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:10.620
you got that in the book?

00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:21.740 position:56%
And I looked at him, and I said, no.

00:31:21.740 --> 00:31:23.210
Well, let me tell you.

00:31:23.210 --> 00:31:27.970
He went insane for like
the next two or three days,

00:31:27.970 --> 00:31:30.360
but then after that he kind
of calmed down about it.

00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:34.800
But, because he felt, you
know, if somebody asked

00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:38.830
for something, he should have it.

00:31:38.830 --> 00:31:43.390
You know? It was just his,
you know, crowd control.

00:31:43.390 --> 00:31:48.980
The best one was, when it comes
to numbers and arrangements,

00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:52.940
they asked use to play at the
Federal House of Detention

00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:56.300
for the prison system in New York.

00:31:56.300 --> 00:31:58.040
And these guys were
going to get all shipped

00:31:58.040 --> 00:32:04.910
out to all different high security
prisons across the country.

00:32:04.910 --> 00:32:09.280
So now they requested,
you know, music,

00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:14.750
so then they call Machito
Orchestra so we can go to the jail,

00:32:14.750 --> 00:32:18.630
[inaudible], and we hear people,
hey, Machito, 321, hey, Machito,

00:32:18.630 --> 00:32:22.650
556, hey, when they open up the
curtain it was all our friends.

00:32:22.650 --> 00:32:23.950
They were all locked up.

00:32:23.950 --> 00:32:27.270
They were being shipped out,
Texas, Leavenworth, you know.

00:32:27.270 --> 00:32:40.020
We have some people here that
spent a little time in Leavenworth,

00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:43.070
on the good side of Leavenworth.

00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:44.370
Yeah, right?

00:32:44.370 --> 00:32:45.670
You guys were in Leavenworth,
weren't you?

00:32:45.670 --> 00:32:50.060
Yeah. So yeah, he always
thought that, so then we played,

00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:52.990
and then the funniest thing was
that, now we're leaving, you know,

00:32:52.990 --> 00:32:56.280
the gig is over and we're leaving,
you know, and one of the guys said,

00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:59.900
yo listen man, can I
have those maracas?

00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:02.520
So I'm like, yeah, so now
he's walking out with the band

00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:04.330
like he's part of the band
with them, and so like one

00:33:04.330 --> 00:33:08.530
of the security guards grabs
him and yanks him back.

00:33:08.530 --> 00:33:10.830
You know, crazy stuff.

00:33:10.830 --> 00:33:15.440
One thing I want to
touch on, maracas.

00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:17.900
Maracas was Machito's instrument.

00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:19.230
You know? Whatever.

00:33:19.230 --> 00:33:22.990 position:56%
So now they would always steal them.

00:33:22.990 --> 00:33:25.260
They would always steal them.

00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:28.050 position:56%
They would always steal his maracas.

00:33:28.050 --> 00:33:32.140
No matter where he hid them, in
the piano, behind the bandstand,

00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:34.410
no matter what, they'd
find, they'd steal them.

00:33:34.410 --> 00:33:37.340
So then we go to Europe, and
we were going to be out man,

00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:39.620
like 10 weeks man,
that's a long time.

00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:43.500
So I took his pair, wouldn't
you know, second gig,

00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:45.460
third gig, they steal them.

00:33:45.460 --> 00:33:48.100 position:56%
Now he's furious, where' my maracas.

00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:51.000
I said don't worry about the
maracas, we're in Berlin,

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:52.300
there's got to be a music store.

00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:56.840
When I went in, there's two
pairs left, so I said to him.

00:33:56.840 --> 00:33:58.140
I said, you know what?

00:33:58.140 --> 00:34:03.030
I should get the two
pair just in case.

00:34:03.030 --> 00:34:05.890
Give him his maracas,
we did a whole bunch

00:34:05.890 --> 00:34:09.000
of gigs, they steal the maracas.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:15.660
So now he comes to me, I
got another pair for you.

00:34:15.660 --> 00:34:16.960
Here, here you go.

00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:18.930
And this is your model.

00:34:18.930 --> 00:34:22.120 position:56%
When Latin percussion made the mold,

00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:26.460
that's Machito's mold,
his favorite design.

00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:29.910
Anyway, they sold about
80 million pair of those,

00:34:29.910 --> 00:34:32.430
haven't seen a penny,
but that's cool.

00:34:32.430 --> 00:34:40.940
So now, next city I go in, I
bought five pair of maracas,

00:34:40.940 --> 00:34:44.140
and I sold one pair, which I'm sure
you've seen those old traditional

00:34:44.140 --> 00:34:47.150
maracas with the coconuts
painted on them

00:34:47.150 --> 00:34:49.720
and palm trees, you
know, real corny.

00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:52.830
You know? Well, he went
through the other five pair

00:34:52.830 --> 00:34:54.130
in the span of the trip.

00:34:54.130 --> 00:34:56.610
Now we're down to the
last week of the trip.

00:34:56.610 --> 00:34:57.910
No maracas.

00:34:57.910 --> 00:34:59.210
I'm like oh, man.

00:34:59.210 --> 00:35:00.510
I said, well, you know what,

00:35:00.510 --> 00:35:03.140
I've got that bluff pair
that's more decoration

00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:05.200
than anything else, you know?

00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:08.050
But now, as I'm ready, I'm going
to give it to him, I'm saying,

00:35:08.050 --> 00:35:11.230
he's going to freak out when
I give him this, you know,

00:35:11.230 --> 00:35:12.910
I mean, what is he going to say?

00:35:12.910 --> 00:35:17.090
You know? So I go into the gig, and
I say, you know what, I'm sorry,

00:35:17.090 --> 00:35:18.390
but this is what I've got.

00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:20.510
And he looks at him
and he goes, wow,

00:35:20.510 --> 00:35:22.570
these are the best maracas
I've ever seen in my life.

00:35:22.570 --> 00:35:25.010
And I'm like, really?

00:35:25.010 --> 00:35:28.530
And he goes those are the
ones I'm going to use today.

00:35:28.530 --> 00:35:33.580
So then, as much as he concerns
himself about a lot of things,

00:35:33.580 --> 00:35:37.040
he was really big into his maracas.

00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:45.050
As a matter of fact, my
mother, well, let's just say

00:35:45.050 --> 00:35:50.240
that maracas is a very
important story.

00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:56.150
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: Yeah,
he could really play, too.

00:35:56.150 --> 00:35:58.620
I mean a lot of people, a lot
of singers stand up in front

00:35:58.620 --> 00:36:02.040
of the band and they just sort
of play a few little patterns,

00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:04.080
Machito could really
play those things.

00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:05.380
&gt;&gt; Mario Grillo: Yeah.

00:36:05.380 --> 00:36:06.680
Yeah.

00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:13.270 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: Did he teach you
anything about how to play maracas?

00:36:13.270 --> 00:36:17.930
&gt;&gt; Mario Grillo: Well,
one day Daddy tells me,

00:36:17.930 --> 00:36:21.610
I'm sending you two a jingle, with
Chico to help to cover for me.

00:36:21.610 --> 00:36:23.970
I said, okay, cool,
what am I playing?

00:36:23.970 --> 00:36:27.290 position:56%
He said, you're playing the maracas.

00:36:27.290 --> 00:36:31.950
So I looked at him, and I must have
been about, around that time, 15,

00:36:31.950 --> 00:36:36.150 position:56%
16, and I said, you know what,
Daddy, strangely enough if I, Jesus,

00:36:36.150 --> 00:36:37.950
I don't know how to
play the maracas.

00:36:37.950 --> 00:36:40.730
He goes, what do you mean you
don't know how to play the maracas?

00:36:40.730 --> 00:36:42.030
What are you, kidding me?

00:36:42.030 --> 00:36:43.330
You're my son.

00:36:43.330 --> 00:36:44.630
You don't know to play the maracas?

00:36:44.630 --> 00:36:49.500
I said, Daddy, I don't, you
never taught me, I don't know.

00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:52.310
He goes, all right, go get
a couple of pair of maracas.

00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:55.080
So I go to the music room,
living room, come back.

00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:59.470
So he stands in front of me, so
now he's standing in front of me,

00:36:59.470 --> 00:37:01.570
showing me the motions, you know?

00:37:01.570 --> 00:37:04.640
I couldn't get it, you know?

00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:07.310
Now we're standing
side by side looking

00:37:07.310 --> 00:37:10.810
in the mirror, couldn't get it.

00:37:10.810 --> 00:37:16.030 position:56%
You know? So now he's at his wit's
end, you know, he says to me, Jesus,

00:37:16.030 --> 00:37:20.380 position:56%
[inaudible] I can't believe that you
know, you can't play the maracas.

00:37:20.380 --> 00:37:22.250
You're not my son.

00:37:22.250 --> 00:37:24.790
I'm like yo, man, you know?

00:37:24.790 --> 00:37:27.610
So now he gets, he
says, wait a minute,

00:37:27.610 --> 00:37:34.780
so now he stood behind me
and he helped, you know?

00:37:34.780 --> 00:37:37.780
So I'm like, oh, okay, cool.

00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:40.720
You know? So now I
go to the recording,

00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:43.260
whatever the case might
be, so I come home,

00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:45.220
and he says to me how did you do?

00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:46.520
I said, well, it was fine man.

00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:47.820
It was great.

00:37:47.820 --> 00:37:49.120
He said, did you play the
maracas the way I taught you.

00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:51.170
I said, yeah, I said,
as a matter of fact,

00:37:51.170 --> 00:37:53.480
Chico O'Farill told me I
play better maracas than you.

00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:57.430
What? Yeah.

00:37:57.430 --> 00:38:01.130
It's a tremendous instrument,
and again,

00:38:01.130 --> 00:38:04.470
there are unique patterns
that you can use.

00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:06.530
But his pattern was very slick,

00:38:06.530 --> 00:38:10.430
and his whole thing
was I use this pattern

00:38:10.430 --> 00:38:14.410
because I don't want my
jacket to get wrinkled.

00:38:14.410 --> 00:38:18.140
You know, many maraca players
keep the maracas tight,

00:38:18.140 --> 00:38:21.780
so then when you let go your
jacket is all, you know,

00:38:21.780 --> 00:38:23.500
it looks like an according.

00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:27.360
But his motion was more out,
so therefore his jacket,

00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:29.300
and the crease, would stay as is.

00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:30.600
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: Nice.

00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:31.900
&gt;&gt; Mario Grillo: Yeah.

00:38:31.900 --> 00:38:35.920
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: So, for a
period of a good 20, 25 years, he,

00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:38.130
along with [inaudible],
they're at the top.

00:38:38.130 --> 00:38:42.640
They're at the summit of
Latin music in New York.

00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:47.120
And then by the time the 1960s,
especially the mid and late 60s,

00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:49.670
rolled around, tastes
are starting to change.

00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:50.970
There's a new generation.

00:38:50.970 --> 00:38:54.460 position:56%
Yeah. They're not so much interested
in the classic stuff as much

00:38:54.460 --> 00:38:57.890
as they want the new dance
rhythms, they want pachanga,

00:38:57.890 --> 00:39:00.330
they want Latin soul,
they want boogaloo.

00:39:00.330 --> 00:39:01.630
&gt;&gt; Mario Grillo: Boogaloo.

00:39:01.630 --> 00:39:02.930
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: Yeah.

00:39:02.930 --> 00:39:05.530
So how did Machito adapt, or
did, how well did it adapt?

00:39:05.530 --> 00:39:07.040
&gt;&gt; Mario Grillo: Machito's
philosophy was

00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:12.540
if you can't beat them, join them.

00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:14.010
My uncle Mario, no.

00:39:14.010 --> 00:39:18.710
Mario was very hard
core on what he wanted.

00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:21.130
Very tough twist his arm.

00:39:21.130 --> 00:39:22.430
But Daddy, no.

00:39:22.430 --> 00:39:26.540
His thing was we were
his sounding board.

00:39:26.540 --> 00:39:29.270
We never let, you know,
we never listened

00:39:29.270 --> 00:39:32.060
to Machito's records in my house.

00:39:32.060 --> 00:39:36.250
We don't have record collections.

00:39:36.250 --> 00:39:39.970
But if you want to find the
most complete record collection

00:39:39.970 --> 00:39:43.980
of Machito, go to Our Lady Queen
of Angels Grammar School on 112,

00:39:43.980 --> 00:39:48.720
between Second and Third, and
the nuns have all those records.

00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:53.250 position:56%
Because Daddy would come home with a
box of 25 albums and give them out.

00:39:53.250 --> 00:39:57.930
The butcher, the dry cleaner,
Solento's, you know, all the places

00:39:57.930 --> 00:40:00.250
that he stopped, he'd give
them these record albums.

00:40:00.250 --> 00:40:01.550
We never kept them.

00:40:01.550 --> 00:40:03.090
You know, we'd give them away.

00:40:03.090 --> 00:40:09.630
As a matter of fact, one winter
we were all out, you know,

00:40:09.630 --> 00:40:15.600
we were all leaving, we all had
our cars, and so it had snowed,

00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:18.880
so it was ice all over
the windshields.

00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:22.210
So my brother and my sisters, they
opened up the trunks and they took

00:40:22.210 --> 00:40:26.740
out Daddy's albums, broke
them in half and used

00:40:26.740 --> 00:40:32.010
that to scrape the ice off
the windshield, you know.

00:40:32.010 --> 00:40:34.650
We use to use those albums
to keep the windows open

00:40:34.650 --> 00:40:37.730
in the summer to get fresh air.

00:40:37.730 --> 00:40:42.750
You see? So now here comes
Daddy and he sees us, you know?

00:40:42.750 --> 00:40:48.970
Now when we looked at him our
initial thing was like, oh man.

00:40:48.970 --> 00:40:52.170
He's going to freak out, you know?

00:40:52.170 --> 00:40:53.470
With this?

00:40:53.470 --> 00:40:55.490 position:56%
I mean, look, look what we're doing.

00:40:55.490 --> 00:40:57.420
You know? And he looked
at us and he goes,

00:40:57.420 --> 00:41:00.250
listen, give me that other half.

00:41:00.250 --> 00:41:07.910
And he was scraping the ice off the
windshield with his own records.

00:41:07.910 --> 00:41:11.920
These things didn't mean, later
on, they did, like when we would go

00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:16.550 position:56%
to Europe, he would go to the record
stores and buy his own albums.

00:41:16.550 --> 00:41:17.890
And I would say Daddy, what are,

00:41:17.890 --> 00:41:20.300
what are you buying
your own albums for?

00:41:20.300 --> 00:41:23.410
He goes, it was such a long
time ago, I forgot what's on it.

00:41:23.410 --> 00:41:25.580
I'd like to hear it again.

00:41:25.580 --> 00:41:31.860 position:56%
You know? I mean, we, we, we
weren't collectors of Daddy's stuff.

00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:33.160
Not at all.

00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:35.190 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: Do you think he,
do you think he got his royalties?

00:41:35.190 --> 00:41:36.490
Did he ever get exploited?

00:41:36.490 --> 00:41:37.790
&gt;&gt; Mario Grillo: Yeah.

00:41:37.790 --> 00:41:39.090
Sure, sure, sure.

00:41:39.090 --> 00:41:43.030 position:56%
Well, what we discovered with all
these world searches, we didn't know

00:41:43.030 --> 00:41:47.700
that Machito sold records in the
Soviet Union, and in Italy, France,

00:41:47.700 --> 00:41:51.680
Germany, Holland, Belgium,
Sweden, Switzerland,

00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:55.770 position:56%
Luxembourg, I mean, Spain, Portugal.

00:41:55.770 --> 00:42:01.080
We had no clue that he had record
sales in all those countries.

00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:04.670
Then we did start getting a
lot of royalties back and that,

00:42:04.670 --> 00:42:06.970
and that was a very positive thing.

00:42:06.970 --> 00:42:08.270
We still do.

00:42:08.270 --> 00:42:16.430 position:56%
When they turned over all the albums
to CD's, we did very nicely on that.

00:42:16.430 --> 00:42:21.710
So then, yeah, we certainly
have seen royalties, and we do.

00:42:21.710 --> 00:42:24.680
I mean, it's not like Micahel
Jackson royalties or anything

00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:27.220
like that, but certainly,
yes, we do.

00:42:27.220 --> 00:42:28.520
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: Okay.

00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:31.700
So back to this period, this
transition period, where he starts

00:42:31.700 --> 00:42:38.090
to adapt the art, changing taste,
and then as so inevitably happens,

00:42:38.090 --> 00:42:42.000
the phone doesn't ring
as often for gigs.

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.670
And I know when we were
talking a few months ago,

00:42:44.670 --> 00:42:49.300
you were telling me how important
Dizzy Gillespie at that time,

00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:51.790
at that period in his career.

00:42:51.790 --> 00:42:53.430
Why don't you tell us a
little bit more about that?

00:42:53.430 --> 00:42:56.950
&gt;&gt; Mario Grillo: Well, the first
thing is that the relationship

00:42:56.950 --> 00:43:00.560
with Machito and Dizzy
was from way, way back.

00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:05.210
He was Mario Bauza's room mate when
they were in Cab Calloway's band,

00:43:05.210 --> 00:43:07.750
so the friendship was
a very long one.

00:43:07.750 --> 00:43:12.350
And Dizzy saw that we, we
were having a little bit

00:43:12.350 --> 00:43:16.170
of a tough time there booking big
bands, because big bands was out.

00:43:16.170 --> 00:43:17.940
You know, the era was over.

00:43:17.940 --> 00:43:22.360 position:56%
And even Dizzy, himself, had a tough
time booking his full orchestra.

00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:27.450
So then, what he did, was he made
us his accompanying orchestra,

00:43:27.450 --> 00:43:29.990
which took the pressure off
of him an the responsibility

00:43:29.990 --> 00:43:32.840
of running the band, but
knowing that he had a band

00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:35.070
that would play whatever
needed to be played.

00:43:35.070 --> 00:43:37.420
And strangely enough,
when Dizzy worked with us,

00:43:37.420 --> 00:43:40.840
he didn't play his
music, he played ours.

00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:42.950
We didn't play Monteca
or [inaudible],

00:43:42.950 --> 00:43:44.960
we never played any of that.

00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:49.010
We used to play straight ahead
Machito music and Dizzy would blow

00:43:49.010 --> 00:43:52.760
on top of that, which
was incredible.

00:43:52.760 --> 00:44:00.150
And as I had told you,
Dizzy, Dizzy brought back

00:44:00.150 --> 00:44:08.730
to life Machito Orchestra in a
huge way and gave me credibility.

00:44:08.730 --> 00:44:12.590
When my dad passed
away, that was it.

00:44:12.590 --> 00:44:14.530
we were done.

00:44:14.530 --> 00:44:17.600
You know? That's the end of Machito
Orchestra, forget about these guys.

00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:20.260
This is finished, you know?

00:44:20.260 --> 00:44:26.530
And I was home six months,
phone never rang, six months.

00:44:26.530 --> 00:44:29.200
And I was like yo, you know?

00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:32.780
You know, I'd pick up the phone,
nnnnn, see if it was working.

00:44:32.780 --> 00:44:36.720
You know? And Dizzy
Gillespie calls me.

00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:39.330
He tells me, yo Mario,
man, what you doing, man?

00:44:39.330 --> 00:44:45.150
I said, Jesus, dude,
I'm not doing nothing.

00:44:45.150 --> 00:44:48.790
He says, okay, they're going to
call you from the Village Gate

00:44:48.790 --> 00:44:53.010
in New York City, Jack Hook
and Ralph Mercado, these guys,

00:44:53.010 --> 00:44:55.720
they're going to call you up
and they're going to tell you

00:44:55.720 --> 00:45:00.580
that they want you to accompany
me at the Village Gate.

00:45:00.580 --> 00:45:06.370 position:56%
They don't want you to accompany me
at the Village Gate, but I told them

00:45:06.370 --> 00:45:11.420
that I'll only do the Village
Gate if you accompany me.

00:45:11.420 --> 00:45:13.620
You ready?

00:45:13.620 --> 00:45:14.920
I said, yeah.

00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:18.650
He said, all right,
they're going to call you.

00:45:18.650 --> 00:45:19.950
I said, okay, cool.

00:45:19.950 --> 00:45:21.250
I hang up the phone.

00:45:21.250 --> 00:45:22.840
Fifteen minutes later,
oh, hey Mario, listen man,

00:45:22.840 --> 00:45:25.260 position:56%
we're calling from the Village
Gate, hey we'd love to have you come

00:45:25.260 --> 00:45:27.640
down and play a gig for us.

00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:29.790
We got Dizzy, Dizzy's
going to do it,

00:45:29.790 --> 00:45:31.090
and you know, that would be nice.

00:45:31.090 --> 00:45:32.390
Are you available?

00:45:32.390 --> 00:45:37.150
I said, yeah, yeah,
yeah, I can make that.

00:45:37.150 --> 00:45:41.830
Boom, back to life,
Machito Orchestra.

00:45:41.830 --> 00:45:43.140
Incredible.

00:45:43.140 --> 00:45:46.940
Then he calls me back, tells
me yo, the gig went well, nice.

00:45:46.940 --> 00:45:48.240
I liked it.

00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:52.430
Let's go to Chicago to
do the Jazz Festival.

00:45:52.430 --> 00:45:59.900 position:56%
I've got Johnny Griffin, Art Blakey,
George Duvivier, Randy Weston,

00:45:59.900 --> 00:46:05.310
Melba Liston on the band,
I want you to accompany me.

00:46:05.310 --> 00:46:07.930
Well then, well and
the rest is history.

00:46:07.930 --> 00:46:09.360
I'm here.

00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:11.410
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: And
then he helped you break

00:46:11.410 --> 00:46:14.100
into the European market
in a big way.

00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:17.480
&gt;&gt; Mario Grillo: We had
never tapped that market.

00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:19.880
So we were fresh as a daisy.

00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:24.620
So when we go to Europe the first
time, in 75 we played in Paris

00:46:24.620 --> 00:46:30.360
and we played in Berlin, they,
they knew us, we didn't know them.

00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:31.660
And that was incredible.

00:46:31.660 --> 00:46:41.190
Then we went to Europe one summer,
we played 55 concerts in 66 days.

00:46:41.190 --> 00:46:45.470
We covered 13 countries
and 35 cities.

00:46:45.470 --> 00:46:52.700
We traveled by bus, plane,
train, ferry, 10,000 miles.

00:46:52.700 --> 00:46:54.150
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum:
That's how you do it.

00:46:54.150 --> 00:46:56.420
&gt;&gt; Mario Grillo: You know?

00:46:56.420 --> 00:46:57.910
That's how you do it.

00:46:57.910 --> 00:46:59.430
And that's how we did it.

00:46:59.430 --> 00:47:03.500
And at the front of the bus,
and at the front of the train,

00:47:03.500 --> 00:47:06.150
and the plane, the
ferry, the bicycle

00:47:06.150 --> 00:47:10.470
and the roller skates, was Machito.

00:47:10.470 --> 00:47:15.750
Because, even though he was an old
lion, old lions still have a couple

00:47:15.750 --> 00:47:19.200
of teeth and they can roar.

00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:22.310
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: Speaking
of which, you mentioned earlier

00:47:22.310 --> 00:47:25.790
that Mario was kind of a
tough guy, Mario Bauza.

00:47:25.790 --> 00:47:27.090
&gt;&gt; Mario Grillo: Good cop, bad cop.

00:47:27.090 --> 00:47:28.390
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: Yeah.

00:47:28.390 --> 00:47:30.210
So tell me about your
father's personality,

00:47:30.210 --> 00:47:34.480
not just as a family or, but
just what he's like as a person.

00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:37.660
&gt;&gt; Mario Grillo: Well, as far as
music was concerned, you know,

00:47:37.660 --> 00:47:42.070
Machito had his own Holy
Trinity, which was Mario Bauza,

00:47:42.070 --> 00:47:44.120
Chico O'Farill, Rene Hernandez.

00:47:44.120 --> 00:47:45.670
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: Those
are the three arrangers he.

00:47:45.670 --> 00:47:51.230
&gt;&gt; Mario Grillo: He put his
undying faith in what they said.

00:47:51.230 --> 00:48:00.010
But, every now and then he would
say no, this is the way I want it,

00:48:00.010 --> 00:48:01.790
and then that's the way it was.

00:48:01.790 --> 00:48:06.950
But 99% of the time, all
decisions were made by Mario.

00:48:06.950 --> 00:48:12.010
One of the ones that Daddy
made, which was a biggie,

00:48:12.010 --> 00:48:16.700
was when the boogaloo came,
boogaloo, Machito playing boogaloo?

00:48:16.700 --> 00:48:18.100
You've got to be kidding me.

00:48:18.100 --> 00:48:19.790
You know? That's for the kids.

00:48:19.790 --> 00:48:25.280
You know, Joe Bataan, Willie Colon,
Hector Lavoe and Orchestra D.J.,

00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:28.200
the LaBron Brothers, you know,
that's what was happening.

00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:31.590
As a matter of fact, my brother
in law used to book those bands

00:48:31.590 --> 00:48:35.210
to throw dances in Harlem.

00:48:35.210 --> 00:48:40.540
But they came to Daddy, Manny and
George [inaudible] Morris Levy,

00:48:40.540 --> 00:48:43.540
those kind of guys, says
Machito, you know what Machito,

00:48:43.540 --> 00:48:47.510
you're out of style Machito.

00:48:47.510 --> 00:48:48.810
Nobody knows you, Machito.

00:48:48.810 --> 00:48:50.110
You're done.

00:48:50.110 --> 00:48:51.410
You're done.

00:48:51.410 --> 00:48:54.760
You know what you got to do
Machito, to come back to life?

00:48:54.760 --> 00:48:57.990 position:56%
So Daddy says, yeah, George, what do
I have to do to come back to life?

00:48:57.990 --> 00:49:00.320
He says, why don't
you do a boogaloo?

00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:02.060
What's what's happening now.

00:49:02.060 --> 00:49:04.160
All these kids, it's the boogaloo.

00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:05.460
They don't know anything else.

00:49:05.460 --> 00:49:06.760
They don't know Machito.

00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:10.190
Maybe their grandparents, but
they don't know who, you know?

00:49:10.190 --> 00:49:14.250
He says I got a kid on my
label named Joey Pastrana,

00:49:14.250 --> 00:49:18.750 position:56%
he's hot as a pistol, driving around
in a brand new Lincoln Continental.

00:49:18.750 --> 00:49:23.510
Let me get him together with you
for him to write something for you.

00:49:23.510 --> 00:49:27.530 position:56%
Now can you imagine, selling a 50
something year old man that's been a

00:49:27.530 --> 00:49:31.220
superstar, that an 18 year old
kid is going to write for you?

00:49:31.220 --> 00:49:33.740
I mean, that's pretty crazy.

00:49:33.740 --> 00:49:36.140
But he comes to Daddy and says,
Machito, you know what Machito,

00:49:36.140 --> 00:49:39.210
I got a boogaloo for you, man.

00:49:39.210 --> 00:49:40.510
He said, yeah, Joey?

00:49:40.510 --> 00:49:41.810
How does it go?

00:49:41.810 --> 00:49:43.610
He says,

00:49:43.610 --> 00:49:48.240
[ Singing ]

00:49:48.240 --> 00:49:55.250
So Daddy's looking at
him, and he's like, but,

00:49:55.250 --> 00:49:58.540
he said, you know what Joey?

00:49:58.540 --> 00:50:02.390
Yeah. I like that tune.

00:50:02.390 --> 00:50:05.670
Let's record that.

00:50:05.670 --> 00:50:08.260
Mega hit. Mega hit.

00:50:08.260 --> 00:50:11.920
Well, we moved to the
Bronx, well after all,

00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:13.750
we moved from East
Harlem to the Bronx.

00:50:13.750 --> 00:50:15.600
So the hot seat's the hot seat.

00:50:15.600 --> 00:50:20.000
Oh, to the Bronx, that
was big you know?

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:28.350 position:56%
Oh, yeah. So, I mean, he had moments
when, when his decisions were right

00:50:28.350 --> 00:50:30.430
on the money, incredible.

00:50:30.430 --> 00:50:34.110
I don't know how he did
it, but he had a knack

00:50:34.110 --> 00:50:38.240
for picking the right piece
at the right time, you know,

00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:41.370
the pulse of what's going on.

00:50:41.370 --> 00:50:44.340
I don't, unfortunately,
I don't have that.

00:50:44.340 --> 00:50:45.700
But he did.

00:50:45.700 --> 00:50:49.000
You know, he knew when it was
time to whip in to something new.

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:54.740
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: Let me take
a moment to just say how Mario

00:50:54.740 --> 00:50:57.500
and I first really connected was

00:50:57.500 --> 00:51:01.130
after this performance
at the Kennedy Center.

00:51:01.130 --> 00:51:03.410
I met him at his hotel.

00:51:03.410 --> 00:51:06.770
And I, to this day, I regret
not bringing a tape recorder

00:51:06.770 --> 00:51:09.690
because he told all of
these incredible stories.

00:51:09.690 --> 00:51:16.650
And then that's when I planted
the seed about, you know,

00:51:16.650 --> 00:51:20.570
you have the library,
have you thought of a home

00:51:20.570 --> 00:51:25.960 position:56%
where it might become accessible for
scholarly researchers or musicians?

00:51:25.960 --> 00:51:29.700
And so I encouraged
him to think about that

00:51:29.700 --> 00:51:33.150
and said any time you want to
talk about the Library of Congress

00:51:33.150 --> 00:51:36.590
as a home for that, let's talk.

00:51:36.590 --> 00:51:44.180
Well, I was blown away by the
fact that he then goes and reaches

00:51:44.180 --> 00:51:49.880
into his bag and he pulls out
this arrangements of Tonga.

00:51:49.880 --> 00:51:54.690
It's arranged by Rene
Hernandez, it's in his hand.

00:51:54.690 --> 00:51:59.410
This is one of the great signature
pieces by Machito, and he gives it

00:51:59.410 --> 00:52:03.570
to me and says he wants to donate
this to the Library of Congress.

00:52:03.570 --> 00:52:09.190
So I was not expecting that,
I was so grateful on behalf

00:52:09.190 --> 00:52:12.110
of the Library, because
this is the kind of thing

00:52:12.110 --> 00:52:15.000
that scholars need to see.

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:16.890
They come to us all the time.

00:52:16.890 --> 00:52:21.770
And, in fact, there's very
little in any library,

00:52:21.770 --> 00:52:26.240
in any archive anywhere, that
documents this golden age

00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:30.800
of Afro-Cuban or Latin
music and Latin jazz

00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:33.800
in the United States
in the 40s, 50s, 60s.

00:52:33.800 --> 00:52:35.270
You go to all the great libraries,

00:52:35.270 --> 00:52:39.420
there's next to nothing
from this genre.

00:52:39.420 --> 00:52:44.070
And so yes, we're grateful for
this, but we continue to talk,

00:52:44.070 --> 00:52:46.280
and then Mario decided he wants

00:52:46.280 --> 00:52:49.960
to give the Library the
whole collection of scores,

00:52:49.960 --> 00:52:53.320
parts and other things to
the Library of Congress.

00:52:53.320 --> 00:52:56.540
Now can you talk a little
bit about why you decided

00:52:56.540 --> 00:52:59.400
on the Library of Congress for it?

00:52:59.400 --> 00:53:04.690
&gt;&gt; Mario Grillo: Well, certainly
and most obviously the Library

00:53:04.690 --> 00:53:09.940
of Congress is the oldest
institution of it's kind

00:53:09.940 --> 00:53:11.360
in the United States of America,

00:53:11.360 --> 00:53:16.690
if I'm not mistaken,
it was founded in 1800.

00:53:16.690 --> 00:53:20.550
There's been two fires here,
I hope there's not a third.

00:53:21.860 --> 00:53:26.470
And some of the most
important scholarly works

00:53:26.470 --> 00:53:28.810
in all areas are here.

00:53:28.810 --> 00:53:36.190 position:56%
Now, most certainly, I had thought
about keeping the music in New York,

00:53:36.190 --> 00:53:41.850
keeping it at home, maybe an
institution of higher learning,

00:53:41.850 --> 00:53:45.550
you know, the Julliard School
of Music or Manhattan School

00:53:45.550 --> 00:53:50.810
of Music, Jazz at Lincoln Center.

00:53:50.810 --> 00:53:53.740
But, I thought you know what?

00:53:53.740 --> 00:54:04.230
No. If you want to be any place,
it is the Library of Congress.

00:54:05.370 --> 00:54:11.510
It took 75 years, but we're here.

00:54:11.510 --> 00:54:19.260
[ Applause ]

00:54:19.260 --> 00:54:20.560
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: This
is the place for it.

00:54:20.560 --> 00:54:24.120
And I know at the time you were
mentioning how important it is

00:54:24.120 --> 00:54:28.830
that not just people in this
generation understand who he was,

00:54:28.830 --> 00:54:33.030
but every generation that follows
will not be able to come here,

00:54:33.030 --> 00:54:37.760
research his music, understand
more about what this man meant,

00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:41.490
what he represented to his
family, to his community

00:54:41.490 --> 00:54:43.780
and to the culture of the world.

00:54:43.780 --> 00:54:47.230
So it's here, it will be preserved,
we encourage everybody to come

00:54:47.230 --> 00:54:49.110
and make use of this collection.

00:54:49.110 --> 00:54:52.320
Because it's not enough to just
put things up on a shelf somewhere,

00:54:52.320 --> 00:54:55.080
this is a living archive,
a living library.

00:54:55.080 --> 00:54:58.970
And to that, on point, I want to
encourage everybody at the end

00:54:58.970 --> 00:55:03.080
of this, we have a display of
materials that Mario brought

00:55:03.080 --> 00:55:05.210
to us that he's donating.

00:55:05.210 --> 00:55:09.320
You'll see these extraordinary
scores, hand written,

00:55:09.320 --> 00:55:14.880
and this is what we are going
to do from now, into the future,

00:55:14.880 --> 00:55:18.030
we are going to provide, we are
going to serve these materials

00:55:18.030 --> 00:55:21.190
in the music division's
reading room,

00:55:21.190 --> 00:55:22.750
the performing art's reading room.

00:55:22.750 --> 00:55:26.420
So it's here, it's safe, it
will be preserved, thank you.

00:55:26.420 --> 00:55:27.720
&gt;&gt; Mario Grillo: Great.

00:55:27.720 --> 00:55:29.020
Thank you.

00:55:29.020 --> 00:55:31.320
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: Yes.

00:55:33.820 --> 00:55:35.520
And now I think it
might be appropriate,

00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:39.170
if anybody has any questions for
Mario, this would be a good time

00:55:39.170 --> 00:55:42.010
to ask, and let's begin right here.

00:55:42.010 --> 00:55:43.310
&gt;&gt; Mario Grillo: Yes?

00:55:43.310 --> 00:55:45.610
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: Oh, hold on,
we have a microphone for you.

00:55:49.830 --> 00:55:54.100
&gt;&gt; Hi, my name's [Inaudible], and I
wanted to thank you for your time.

00:55:54.100 --> 00:56:02.710 position:56%
And the question I have is your
Aunt Graciela, did she have anything

00:56:02.710 --> 00:56:07.110
to do with helping with
the arrangements of music?

00:56:07.110 --> 00:56:08.630
&gt;&gt; Mario Grillo: Well, yes.

00:56:08.630 --> 00:56:10.330
In a very real way.

00:56:10.330 --> 00:56:16.870
Because if she had heard a song or
a lyric brought to her by a writer,

00:56:16.870 --> 00:56:20.840
she would then sit with our
pianist, Rene Hernandez,

00:56:20.840 --> 00:56:25.370
and sing these melodies and
he would arrange accordingly,

00:56:25.370 --> 00:56:30.260
but she always had final say over
the material and what she wanted

00:56:30.260 --> 00:56:34.300
to record and how she
wanted to record it.

00:56:34.300 --> 00:56:39.210
Gracie came to the band in 1943
when Daddy went to the army.

00:56:39.210 --> 00:56:42.100
So she stayed with us until 75,

00:56:42.100 --> 00:56:47.410
so that's like 32 years,
in Machito Orchestra.

00:56:47.410 --> 00:56:52.300
Like I said, Mario came in
1940, until 75, so 35 years.

00:56:52.300 --> 00:56:58.060 position:56%
So yes, she was very instrumental
and gave the band another character.

00:56:58.060 --> 00:57:02.750
I mean her ballads
are out of this world.

00:57:02.750 --> 00:57:04.470
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: She also
did some great novelty tunes.

00:57:04.470 --> 00:57:05.770
&gt;&gt; Mario Grillo: Oh, of course.

00:57:05.770 --> 00:57:07.880
Very, well Gracie came from an era

00:57:07.880 --> 00:57:10.970
when singers sang everything,
you know, ballad,

00:57:13.310 --> 00:57:17.930
She ran the full gamut
of ability as far

00:57:17.930 --> 00:57:21.250
as what she could do as a singer.

00:57:21.250 --> 00:57:22.550
Incredible.

00:57:22.550 --> 00:57:27.060
I've heard many, haven't heard
any like her, certainly not.

00:57:27.060 --> 00:57:28.360
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: Who
else has a question?

00:57:28.360 --> 00:57:30.900
Yes? Felix.

00:57:30.900 --> 00:57:32.960
&gt;&gt; Hi, Felix Contreras from NPR,

00:57:32.960 --> 00:57:36.200
I've got a million questions,
but I'll only ask one.

00:57:36.200 --> 00:57:38.850
Who were some of his influences,

00:57:38.850 --> 00:57:43.060
who were some of Machito's
influences vocal wise?

00:57:43.060 --> 00:57:46.710 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Mario Grillo: Well, keep in mind,
Daddy, when he started in Cuba,

00:57:46.710 --> 00:57:49.470
in particular, he had two very
dear friends, Miguelito Valdes,

00:57:49.470 --> 00:57:54.010
and another gentleman
named Panchito Riset.

00:57:54.010 --> 00:57:55.310
They were all the same age.

00:57:55.310 --> 00:57:58.480
They were in a band called La Hora
de Rendtion [assumed spelling].

00:57:58.480 --> 00:58:01.160
Because there was a band,
Rendition, so that they were

00:58:01.160 --> 00:58:03.530
like the kid version of it.

00:58:03.530 --> 00:58:05.940
And, incredibly, you know,

00:58:05.940 --> 00:58:10.920
those very same three guys
stayed friends for 100 years.

00:58:10.920 --> 00:58:15.050
It was Miguelito Valdes that
put Machito [inaudible].

00:58:15.050 --> 00:58:18.470
So, those were his main influences.

00:58:18.470 --> 00:58:23.330 position:56%
Obviously there were other,
Ignacio Pineiro, those type of guys,

00:58:23.330 --> 00:58:29.040
[inaudible] Lopez, different
orchestras in Cuba that he listened

00:58:29.040 --> 00:58:33.390
to and really appreciated,
[inaudible] as an example.

00:58:33.390 --> 00:58:35.860
So his influences were very wide.

00:58:35.860 --> 00:58:41.440
Then he was already listening to
Duke Ellington and Count Basie

00:58:41.440 --> 00:58:44.250
and those orchestras
while he was in Cuba.

00:58:44.250 --> 00:58:49.450
And I'll give you one, one
funny one about Machito

00:58:49.450 --> 00:58:52.490
and his listening habits.

00:58:52.490 --> 00:58:54.800
In the old days, you know, when
you turned on the radio and,

00:58:54.800 --> 00:58:57.650
of course it was a dial
radio, and you know, whatever,

00:58:57.650 --> 00:59:01.550
so when you turned it on you
pretty much could get a gauge

00:59:01.550 --> 00:59:04.720
of that person as to what
they were into by the music

00:59:04.720 --> 00:59:06.450
that they're listening to.

00:59:06.450 --> 00:59:10.180
So we always had station wagons for
all the equipment and everything.

00:59:10.180 --> 00:59:12.040
So I'd tell Daddy, I
got to borrow the wagon.

00:59:12.040 --> 00:59:13.340
I got to do something.

00:59:13.340 --> 00:59:14.640
And he said, okay, cool.

00:59:14.640 --> 00:59:16.500
So I get in the car and
I turn on the radio,

00:59:16.500 --> 00:59:25.060
but it was like a heavy metal,
you know, acid, you know, AC DC,

00:59:25.060 --> 00:59:31.040
Quiet Riot, you know, Metallica,
you know, Twisted Sister, you know,

00:59:31.040 --> 00:59:35.480
and I'm driving, and
I'm like you know what?

00:59:35.480 --> 00:59:36.780
That's it.

00:59:36.780 --> 00:59:39.820
Daddy flipped out.

00:59:39.820 --> 00:59:43.280
You know, but, you
know what's this about?

00:59:43.280 --> 00:59:46.360
So I continued on my way and
I get back and go upstairs

00:59:46.360 --> 00:59:48.190
and tell Daddy, here's the keys.

00:59:48.190 --> 00:59:51.200
So I said, Daddy, can
I ask you a question?

00:59:51.200 --> 00:59:52.500
He goes, yeah, what?

00:59:52.500 --> 00:59:55.930
I said, have you lost your mind?

00:59:55.930 --> 00:59:58.730
I mean, what are you
listening to on the radio?

00:59:58.730 --> 01:00:00.240
He goes, what do you mean?

01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:02.930
I said, I turned on the radio and
you're listening to heavy metal,

01:00:02.930 --> 01:00:06.950
you know, speed metal, punk metal?

01:00:06.950 --> 01:00:09.860
What do you, what's
the matter with you?

01:00:09.860 --> 01:00:14.990
He goes, oh no, I was turning the
dial and the disc jockey said,

01:00:14.990 --> 01:00:18.090
this next album sold
five million copies.

01:00:18.090 --> 01:00:24.850
I want to know what are these guys
doing to sell five million records

01:00:24.850 --> 01:00:30.020
when I can't even sell 50 records
in my home borough of the Bronx?

01:00:30.020 --> 01:00:31.320
What is it?

01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:36.230
There has to be something for
somebody to take their 10 bucks

01:00:36.230 --> 01:00:39.870
of hard earned money to
go out and buy a record.

01:00:39.870 --> 01:00:44.420
There's something in there
that appeals to them,

01:00:44.420 --> 01:00:46.620
and I want to know what it is.

01:00:46.620 --> 01:00:52.270
So how does a 75 year old
man listen to heavy metal?

01:00:52.270 --> 01:00:54.980
It doesn't make sense, does it?

01:00:54.980 --> 01:00:57.420
But yes, it does.

01:00:57.420 --> 01:01:00.290
Because you want to know, what
is, what, as we say in the music,

01:01:00.290 --> 01:01:02.990
what's the hook in there?

01:01:02.990 --> 01:01:04.610
Violence? Okay.

01:01:04.610 --> 01:01:06.040
Let's be violent.

01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:08.540
You know? If that's
what it is, let's do it.

01:01:08.540 --> 01:01:14.300
We play an extremely conservative
jazz club, the premiere jazz club

01:01:14.300 --> 01:01:18.530
of the era, Ronnie
Scott's in London,

01:01:18.530 --> 01:01:25.490
Fritz in Soho, right by Piccadilly.

01:01:25.490 --> 01:01:29.400
So Daddy would go out in the
afternoon and watch the punks,

01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:32.440
you know, and then he
would invite them to come

01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:35.620
to Ronnie Scott's to
listen to the band.

01:01:35.620 --> 01:01:40.490
So then Ronnie, himself, would
come and say, Machito, Machito,

01:01:40.490 --> 01:01:44.100
there's a couple that's telling
me they're guests of yours.

01:01:44.100 --> 01:01:48.930
One of them is Spike and the other
one, Razor, where would you like me

01:01:48.930 --> 01:01:52.430
to put them, pray tell,
Machito, where will I seat them?

01:01:52.430 --> 01:01:54.250
Next to the Duchess of York?

01:01:54.250 --> 01:01:58.340
I don't think so, I don't think,
maybe with the Earl of Cambridge,

01:01:58.340 --> 01:02:02.700
that might be better for me, yeah,
put them where, and they'd go nuts.

01:02:02.700 --> 01:02:04.000
They'd love it.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:05.370
Because our music is aggressive.

01:02:05.370 --> 01:02:09.720
And when he would seat them,
it became more aggressive.

01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:15.220
So he could connect with the
audience, whatever it might be,

01:02:15.220 --> 01:02:18.780
you know, whether young or old or
whatever their musical taste was

01:02:18.780 --> 01:02:23.090 position:56%
at the moment, he could turn them
around for that hour or so of music,

01:02:23.090 --> 01:02:26.890
which is, I got to, I can't
do that kind of stuff.

01:02:26.890 --> 01:02:28.190
But he could.

01:02:28.190 --> 01:02:29.490
Certainly.

01:02:29.490 --> 01:02:32.000
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: Who
else has a question?

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:33.440
Surely.

01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:37.100
&gt;&gt; Well, then I will
ask, maybe a couple more.

01:02:37.100 --> 01:02:41.060
And one is, after he was
established in New York,

01:02:41.060 --> 01:02:43.700
he became this big
star of the music.

01:02:43.700 --> 01:02:45.120
Did he ever go back to the island?

01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:46.420
&gt;&gt; Mario Grillo: Never.

01:02:46.420 --> 01:02:47.720
Never went back to Cuba.

01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:50.540
As a matter of fact there
was a big stink about that.

01:02:50.540 --> 01:02:56.100
We were in London and the
ambassador of Cuba to London came

01:02:56.100 --> 01:02:58.430
down to Ronnie's and said
Machito, you know what?

01:02:58.430 --> 01:02:59.730
We want to bring you to Cuba.

01:02:59.730 --> 01:03:01.030
He said, no man.

01:03:01.030 --> 01:03:02.530
Thanks, but no thanks.

01:03:02.530 --> 01:03:03.830
Never went back.

01:03:03.830 --> 01:03:09.330 position:56%
Puerto Rico, Venezuela,
[inaudible] Peru, yes, fine, but no,

01:03:09.330 --> 01:03:13.040
he never went back to Cuba.

01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:19.410 position:56%
Now, now that relations have
changed somewhat over the last year,

01:03:19.410 --> 01:03:25.880
and down the road, I think
it would be spectacular

01:03:25.880 --> 01:03:29.340
to take the Machito
Orchestra to Cuba.

01:03:29.340 --> 01:03:33.140
I think that would
be quite something.

01:03:33.140 --> 01:03:37.030
But, on the flip side of that,
where we would play the carnivals

01:03:37.030 --> 01:03:40.100
in Helsinki, Finland, with the
carnivals, all the Cuban bands used

01:03:40.100 --> 01:03:43.860
to come, and after the first
night, the second night,

01:03:43.860 --> 01:03:47.550 position:56%
on of the other musical directors
of one of the other orchestras comes

01:03:47.550 --> 01:03:52.910
over to me and says to me,
listen, let me ask you a question.

01:03:52.910 --> 01:03:58.720
Those arrangements that you
play, how many of them you got?

01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:02.380
I said, man, like a thousand.

01:04:02.380 --> 01:04:05.140
He goes, and they're all like that?

01:04:05.140 --> 01:04:07.840
I said, yeah.

01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:11.700
He said, we've never
heard this music in Cuba.

01:04:13.110 --> 01:04:17.880
We, we, you know, I haven't heard
you play the same tune twice,

01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:22.390
and we've been here five days,
how is that, how is that possible?

01:04:22.390 --> 01:04:25.920
I said, yo, my man, it would take
like another 25 days for me to run

01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:32.790
out of things that I'm playing
for the first time, you know?

01:04:32.790 --> 01:04:38.810
The book is deep, it's
very deep and very varied.

01:04:38.810 --> 01:04:40.940
Machito recorded albums,
I was telling you,

01:04:40.940 --> 01:04:45.230
Machito goes to Memphis, where
he recorded Knock on Wood

01:04:45.230 --> 01:04:49.060
and Satisfaction and
things like that, Alphie,

01:04:49.060 --> 01:04:53.790
there's a Machito Plays Irving
Berlin, there's An Affair

01:04:53.790 --> 01:04:58.480 position:56%
to Remember, he did another one, the
Sun Also Rises based on Hemingway.

01:04:58.480 --> 01:05:01.890
And so the book is very diverse.

01:05:01.890 --> 01:05:06.860
So that, that's a good thing
for me because I have option

01:05:06.860 --> 01:05:10.030
as to what I can go out
and play on a given night.

01:05:10.030 --> 01:05:14.440
It's fun. You know, the
guys, now, and my wife and I,

01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:19.740
we sell it as the Magic
Box, because in that box,

01:05:19.740 --> 01:05:22.160 position:56%
I've got a little bit of everything.

01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:23.460
I'll never run out.

01:05:23.460 --> 01:05:25.990
I don't think so.

01:05:25.990 --> 01:05:32.520
So I'm hoping that my beloved
grandsons will do that.

01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:35.180
Maybe. I hope so.

01:05:35.180 --> 01:05:36.480
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum:
What I love is the fact

01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:43.110
that Machito's library now
resides in our collection next

01:05:43.110 --> 01:05:46.350
to Mendelssohn and Mozart.

01:05:46.350 --> 01:05:47.650
&gt;&gt; Mario Grillo: Well.

01:05:47.650 --> 01:05:49.150
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: Those
are the heavy ones, right?

01:05:49.150 --> 01:05:55.190
&gt;&gt; Mario Grillo: I would go
out on a limb and say yes.

01:05:55.190 --> 01:06:01.620
But also, as you certainly
know, Ella Fitzgerald.

01:06:01.620 --> 01:06:02.920
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: Charles Mingus.

01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:04.220
&gt;&gt; Mario Grillo: Gerry Mulligan.

01:06:04.220 --> 01:06:05.520
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum:Yeah.

01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:06.820
Billy Taylor.

01:06:06.820 --> 01:06:08.120
&gt;&gt; Mario Grillo: Max Roach.

01:06:08.120 --> 01:06:09.420
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: Yeah.

01:06:09.420 --> 01:06:10.720
Eric Dolphy.

01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:12.020
&gt;&gt; Mario Grillo: Yeah, these
are pretty heavy hitters, and,

01:06:12.020 --> 01:06:14.480
as everyone knows, you're
judged by the company you keep.

01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:17.600
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: That's why
I like to hang out with you.

01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:18.970
&gt;&gt; Mario Grillo: Yeah, well,

01:06:18.970 --> 01:06:22.800
I'll give you a good one
about Dr. Billy Taylor.

01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:26.000
Billy Taylor played
in Manchito Orchestra.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.260
So now, we were playing a concert,

01:06:28.260 --> 01:06:32.580
I don't know it it was Avery
Fisher Hall, or some, Avery Fisher,

01:06:32.580 --> 01:06:35.270
I think it was, and I
take my daughter with me.

01:06:35.270 --> 01:06:38.370
She must have been about five
or six, because I had sent her

01:06:38.370 --> 01:06:42.150
to piano class, like you
do to all little girls.

01:06:42.150 --> 01:06:45.280
And you know, she was walking
around, you know, like kids,

01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:47.180
you know, so she comes
up on the stage

01:06:47.180 --> 01:06:52.370
and Billy Taylor was
playing the piano, you know.

01:06:52.370 --> 01:07:00.200 position:56%
And she goes up to him, she says, my
name's Francesca, I play the piano.

01:07:00.200 --> 01:07:02.220
He goes, really, little girl?

01:07:02.220 --> 01:07:04.400
Well, that's very nice.

01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:06.580
And whose little girl are you?

01:07:06.580 --> 01:07:07.880
She says him, him.

01:07:07.880 --> 01:07:09.180
He says, oh, Mario.

01:07:09.180 --> 01:07:12.070
He says, you know what?

01:07:12.070 --> 01:07:13.960
Play something for me.

01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:16.530
Show me what you got.

01:07:16.530 --> 01:07:19.120
So she says, she played
Twinkle Twinkle Little Star.

01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:23.500
And he looks at her and
he says, nice touch.

01:07:23.500 --> 01:07:30.650
Can you imagine Dr. Billy Taylor
telling somebody, nice touch?

01:07:30.650 --> 01:07:34.980
That's so incredible.

01:07:34.980 --> 01:07:41.020
But, you know, I came one time
to D.C. with an all start band,

01:07:41.020 --> 01:07:43.120
with Dizzy, and, you
know, with Stanley D.,

01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:49.720
and all these monster
musicians, you know, the greatest.

01:07:49.720 --> 01:07:52.700
And I looked at Dizzy and I
said, you have to [inaudible].

01:07:54.950 --> 01:07:57.290
Well, what I am doing here, man?

01:07:57.290 --> 01:08:02.780
You know, I don't belong here.

01:08:02.780 --> 01:08:06.870
He goes, nah man, you're
part of the club man.

01:08:06.870 --> 01:08:08.170
Don't think that way.

01:08:08.170 --> 01:08:14.080
And I'm like, whoa,
okay, part of the club.

01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:15.710
I didn't know.

01:08:15.710 --> 01:08:17.330
Thanks for telling me.

01:08:17.330 --> 01:08:21.300
Dizzy Gillespie, one time,
we finished a concert,

01:08:21.300 --> 01:08:26.250
so now I had to play the drum
drums, drum set, finished it,

01:08:26.250 --> 01:08:29.230
so I had been listening to
these tunes for like a month

01:08:29.230 --> 01:08:33.120
on my Walkman, listening,
listening, listening, listening.

01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:34.950
And I'm you know, I'm
having, you know,

01:08:34.950 --> 01:08:37.000
this phobia to learn this material.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.320
So then we get to the concert,
we play the concert without,

01:08:39.320 --> 01:08:41.520
we come back stage,
who's back stage?

01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:46.900
Max Roach, Elvin Jones,
Billy Higgins, Louis Hayes,

01:08:46.900 --> 01:08:53.650 position:56%
Jack DeJohnette, the most incredible
drummers on the face of the earth.

01:08:53.650 --> 01:08:56.930
So now we're standing there, and
I'm standing there, and Dizzy looks

01:08:56.930 --> 01:08:59.770
at me, he goes, you know what,
you know what, Mario man?

01:08:59.770 --> 01:09:01.070
[Inaudible] Dizzy.

01:09:01.070 --> 01:09:04.850
He said, you said you the
greatest drummer I ever played

01:09:04.850 --> 01:09:06.150
with in my whole life.

01:09:06.150 --> 01:09:13.560
And I looked at him, and
I'm saying, gee, Dizzy,

01:09:13.560 --> 01:09:22.250
don't you feel bad embarrassing
me, chastising me, degrading me,

01:09:22.250 --> 01:09:30.010
in front of these guys, with some
cockamamie statement like that?

01:09:30.010 --> 01:09:31.900
I mean, really man?

01:09:31.900 --> 01:09:34.920
He goes, no man, you
the greatest man.

01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:36.220
You know why?

01:09:36.220 --> 01:09:39.550
I said no, why, Dizzy?

01:09:39.550 --> 01:09:46.990
He says, now I don't know if it's
a tremendous level of consistency

01:09:46.990 --> 01:09:54.840
or a total lack of creativity,
but when I play with you,

01:09:54.840 --> 01:09:59.290
I always know where one is,
because all I'm going to hear

01:09:59.290 --> 01:10:02.400
from you all night
is tink, tink a tink.

01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:07.810
When I play with these other
guys, there are crashing symbols,

01:10:07.810 --> 01:10:09.980
rolling drums, crashing base drums,

01:10:09.980 --> 01:10:13.070
half the time I don't know what
the hell is going on in here.

01:10:13.070 --> 01:10:18.000
He says, but with you,
I know I'm okay.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:24.400 position:56%
So then, that's why I say you're the
greatest drummer I've ever played

01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:25.700
with in my life.

01:10:25.700 --> 01:10:32.180
And I looked at him and I said,
well, you know what Dizzy,

01:10:32.180 --> 01:10:38.870
based on your explanation, I
will accept your compliment.

01:10:38.870 --> 01:10:40.170
Incredible.

01:10:40.170 --> 01:10:43.850 position:56%
One time, my mother, we finished a
concert, my mother comes back stage,

01:10:43.850 --> 01:10:50.950
and they were talking and she tells
him, Dizzy, does he play any good.

01:10:50.950 --> 01:10:55.890
He go, yeah, Momma, he
working with me ain't he?

01:10:55.890 --> 01:10:58.180
He's one of the great
drummers of the world.

01:10:58.180 --> 01:11:00.580
You know? Okay, cool.

01:11:00.580 --> 01:11:03.090
So now fast forward a few months,

01:11:03.090 --> 01:11:08.100
and my mother has her
girlfriends having coffee

01:11:08.100 --> 01:11:09.530
and cookies in the living room.

01:11:09.530 --> 01:11:11.580
So my mother said,
how's Martha doing?

01:11:11.580 --> 01:11:13.020
Oh, Martha's fine, you know.

01:11:13.020 --> 01:11:14.320
What about Frank?

01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:15.620
Oh, Frank is doing fine, he's.

01:11:15.620 --> 01:11:16.920
What about Barbara?

01:11:16.920 --> 01:11:18.220
Oh, Barbara's fine, you
know, she's got five kids.

01:11:18.220 --> 01:11:19.520
What about Mario?

01:11:19.520 --> 01:11:22.870
Oh, well, Mario's one
of the great drummers.

01:11:22.870 --> 01:11:27.380
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: And he is
also one of the great benefactors

01:11:27.380 --> 01:11:30.700
who has given this very generous
gift, not just to the Library

01:11:30.700 --> 01:11:32.700
of Congress, but to
the American people.

01:11:32.700 --> 01:11:34.970
Mario, thank you very
much for coming today.

01:11:34.970 --> 01:11:36.270
Thank you.

01:11:36.270 --> 01:11:38.570
And thank you all.

01:11:44.050 --> 01:11:47.700
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
