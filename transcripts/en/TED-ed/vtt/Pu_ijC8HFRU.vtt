00:00:06.896 --> 00:00:10.684
You're swimming in the ocean
when something brushes your leg.

00:00:10.684 --> 00:00:12.352
When the tingling sets in,

00:00:12.352 --> 00:00:15.783
you realize you've been stung 
by a jellyfish.

00:00:15.783 --> 00:00:20.747
How do these beautiful, gelatinous
creatures pack such a painful punch?

00:00:20.747 --> 00:00:24.361
Jellyfish are soft 
because they are 95% water

00:00:24.361 --> 00:00:29.245
and are mostly made of a translucent 
gel-like substance called mesoglea.

00:00:29.245 --> 00:00:30.652
With such delicate bodies,

00:00:30.652 --> 00:00:35.770
they rely on thousands of venom-containing
stinging cells called cnidocytes

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.134
for protection and prey capture.

00:00:38.134 --> 00:00:41.285
Even baby jellyfish, 
the size of a pencil eraser,

00:00:41.285 --> 00:00:43.695
have the ability to sting.

00:00:43.695 --> 00:00:49.563
Larval jellyfish, ephyrae, look like
tiny flowers pulsating in the sea.

00:00:49.563 --> 00:00:53.036
As they grow, they become umbrella-shaped
with a bell at the top

00:00:53.036 --> 00:00:55.745
and descending tentacles 
around the margin.

00:00:55.745 --> 00:00:58.492
The largest species of jellyfish,
the lion's mane,

00:00:58.492 --> 00:01:02.348
has tentacles that can extend 
more than 100 feet,

00:01:02.348 --> 00:01:04.309
longer than a blue whale.

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:07.298
These tentacles contain 
most of the stinging cells,

00:01:07.298 --> 00:01:11.170
although some species have them
on their bells, too.

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.358
Venom is ejected via a nematocyst,

00:01:14.358 --> 00:01:16.474
a whip-like hollow tubule,

00:01:16.474 --> 00:01:20.448
which lies coiled under 
high osmotic pressure.

00:01:20.448 --> 00:01:24.917
When mechanical or chemical stimuli
activate an external trigger,

00:01:24.917 --> 00:01:28.999
the lid of the cell pops open
and sea water rushes in.

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:32.827
This forces a microscopic barbed
harpoon to shoot out,

00:01:32.827 --> 00:01:37.401
penetrate and inject 
venom into its victim.

00:01:37.401 --> 00:01:41.552
Nematocyst discharge can occur
in less than a millionth of a second,

00:01:41.552 --> 00:01:45.462
making it one of nature's fastest
biomechanical processes.

00:01:45.462 --> 00:01:49.867
Nematocysts can continue
to fire even after a jellyfish has died,

00:01:49.867 --> 00:01:53.907
so it's important to remove
lingering tentacles stuck to the skin.

00:01:53.907 --> 00:01:58.827
Rinsing with vinegar will usually render
undischarged nematocysts inactive.

00:01:58.827 --> 00:02:02.651
Seawater can also help 
remove residual nematocysts.

00:02:02.651 --> 00:02:06.092
But don't use fresh water
because any change in salt balance

00:02:06.092 --> 00:02:09.370
alters the osmotic pressure 
outside of the cnidocyte

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:12.322
and will trigger the nematocyst to fire.

00:02:12.322 --> 00:02:16.299
That's why urinating on the affected area,
a common folk remedy,

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:21.537
may do more harm that good,
depending on the composition of the urine.

00:02:21.537 --> 00:02:24.623
Most jellyfish stings 
are a painful nuisance,

00:02:24.623 --> 00:02:26.488
but some can be deadly.

00:02:26.488 --> 00:02:30.028
An Indo-Pacific box jelly,
also called a sea wasp,

00:02:30.028 --> 00:02:33.194
releases venom which can cause
contraction of the heart muscles

00:02:33.194 --> 00:02:35.544
and rapid death in large doses.

00:02:35.544 --> 00:02:38.436
There's an anti-venom,
but the venom is fast-acting,

00:02:38.436 --> 00:02:41.808
so you'd need immediate 
medical intervention.

00:02:41.808 --> 00:02:44.635
Despite the impressive power
in their tentacles,

00:02:44.635 --> 00:02:47.014
jellies aren't invincible.

00:02:47.014 --> 00:02:50.901
Their stinging cells are no match
for the armor of thick-skin predators,

00:02:50.901 --> 00:02:54.662
like the leatherback turtle
and ocean sunfish.

00:02:54.662 --> 00:02:58.766
These predators both have adaptations
that prevents slippery jellyfish

00:02:58.766 --> 00:03:01.554
from escaping after they are engulfed:

00:03:01.554 --> 00:03:04.981
backwards pointing spines 
in the turtle's mouth and esophagus

00:03:04.981 --> 00:03:08.566
and recurved teeth 
behind the sunfish's cheeks.

00:03:08.566 --> 00:03:12.573
Even tiny lobster slipper larvae
can cling to the bell of a jellyfish

00:03:12.573 --> 00:03:14.115
and hitch a ride,

00:03:14.115 --> 00:03:18.354
snacking on the jelly while they preserve
their own energy for growth.

00:03:18.354 --> 00:03:22.801
Small agile fish use the jellies
as moving reefs for protection,

00:03:22.801 --> 00:03:26.773
darting between tentacles
without ever touching them.

00:03:26.773 --> 00:03:30.470
Nudibranchs, which are sea slugs
covered in protective slime,

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.143
can actually steal the jelly's defenses
by eating the cnidocytes

00:03:34.143 --> 00:03:37.763
and transferring them 
to specialized sacks for later use,

00:03:37.763 --> 00:03:40.270
as weapons against their own predators.

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:43.613
Even humans might benefit
from the sting of a jellyfish one day.

00:03:43.613 --> 00:03:47.822
Scientists are working on manipulating
cnidocytes to deliver medicine,

00:03:47.822 --> 00:03:52.473
with nematocysts rarely 3% of the size
of a typical syringe needle.

00:03:52.473 --> 00:03:56.749
So, the next time you're out 
in the ocean, be careful.

00:03:56.749 --> 00:04:00.399
But also, take a second 
to marvel at its wonders.
