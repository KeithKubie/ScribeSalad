00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:38.229 align:start position:0%
appreciate and learn something from but
 

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:40.020 align:start position:0%
appreciate and learn something from but
just<00:04:38.410><c> because</c><00:04:38.560><c> the</c><00:04:38.889><c> message</c><00:04:39.340><c> is</c><00:04:39.580><c> good</c><00:04:39.880><c> it</c>

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 align:start position:0%
just because the message is good it
