interested in this problem and we're

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119
interested in this problem and we're
 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.060
interested in this problem and we're
here to develop animal models with the

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070
here to develop animal models with the
 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.910
here to develop animal models with the
needed study in human populations so we

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920
needed study in human populations so we
 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.219
needed study in human populations so we
developed a molecular approach to human

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229

epidemiology well in e-cigarettes try to

epidemiology well in e-cigarettes try to
mimic a combustible cigarette without

any of the negative effect that are

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180
any of the negative effect that are
 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.440
any of the negative effect that are
associated with combustion a regular

combustible cigarettes includes a lot of

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610
combustible cigarettes includes a lot of
 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.700
combustible cigarettes includes a lot of
other compounds there's a lot of

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710
other compounds there's a lot of
 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.240
other compounds there's a lot of
compounds an e-cigarette is much simpler

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250
compounds an e-cigarette is much simpler
 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.090
compounds an e-cigarette is much simpler
so from that point of view I think it's

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100
so from that point of view I think it's
 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.750
so from that point of view I think it's
a much healthier type of device

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:02.760
a much healthier type of device
 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.570
a much healthier type of device
then a combustible cigarettes but

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580
then a combustible cigarettes but

then a combustible cigarettes but
because it has it consists of nicotine

because it has it consists of nicotine
 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.870
because it has it consists of nicotine
it has the effect on the brain in

it has the effect on the brain in
addition to the effects of the

addition to the effects of the
 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.010
addition to the effects of the
cardiovascular system that a regular

if you give nicotine before cocaine it

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180
if you give nicotine before cocaine it
 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.760
if you give nicotine before cocaine it
dramatically enhances the effects of

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770
dramatically enhances the effects of
 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:23.420
dramatically enhances the effects of

cocaine
 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.370
cocaine
we've cocaine before nicotine doesn't

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380
we've cocaine before nicotine doesn't
 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.200
we've cocaine before nicotine doesn't
have this effect there's no reason to

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210
have this effect there's no reason to
 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.570

increase the likelihood of adolescents

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150
increase the likelihood of adolescents
 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.450
increase the likelihood of adolescents
getting involved with even more

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460
getting involved with even more
 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.850
getting involved with even more
dangerous drugs I think the main message

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860
dangerous drugs I think the main message
 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.570
dangerous drugs I think the main message
is that nicotine not only affects the

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580
is that nicotine not only affects the
 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.240
is that nicotine not only affects the
lungs the heart but it also has very

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250
lungs the heart but it also has very
 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.210
lungs the heart but it also has very
strong effects on the brain and based on

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220
strong effects on the brain and based on
 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.220
strong effects on the brain and based on
the studies that we've done it it

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230
the studies that we've done it it
 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.640
the studies that we've done it it
releases some constraints on genes

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650
releases some constraints on genes
 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.190
releases some constraints on genes
related to addiction and makes the

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200
related to addiction and makes the
 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.530
related to addiction and makes the
individual much more susceptible to

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540
individual much more susceptible to
 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.000
individual much more susceptible to
become addicted to other substances
