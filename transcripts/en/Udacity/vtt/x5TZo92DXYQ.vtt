00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:05.270
Okay, so now that we've been able to play sound at a really slow rate,

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:07.440
here is your next challenge.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.900
You should add a new button to the scene and

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.646
change its image to look like that of a rabbit.

00:00:15.825 --> 00:00:20.260
By the way, this image is available for you to use in the instructor notes.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.060
You should also add constraints to this button so

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.480
it shows up in the top right hand corner of your phone.

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:28.930
Once you're done with this, you can create an action for

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.430
this button and play the movie quote at a really fast speed.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.850
To complete this user interface,

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.390
you can add a stop button at the bottom of the screen.

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.839
This button should stop any audio from playing.

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:44.770
All of this should take you a while to do.

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:49.410
But by now you have the necessary skills to accomplish all of this.

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.710
Here are all the challenges one more time.

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.060
Check this box when you are done.
