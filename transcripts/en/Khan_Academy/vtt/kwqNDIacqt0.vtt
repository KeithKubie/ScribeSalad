00:00:00.298 --> 00:00:01.849
- [Voiceover] So we've
been spending some time now

00:00:01.849 --> 00:00:03.556
thinking about the idea
of a Fourier series,

00:00:03.556 --> 00:00:06.156
taking a periodic function
and representing it

00:00:06.156 --> 00:00:09.329
as the sum of weighted cosines and sines,

00:00:09.329 --> 00:00:11.107
and some of you might say,
well, how is this constant

00:00:11.107 --> 00:00:12.559
a weighted cosine or sine?

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:14.997
Well, you can view a
sub zero as a sub zero

00:00:14.997 --> 00:00:16.914
times cosine of zero t,

00:00:18.653 --> 00:00:20.831
and of course cosine of zero t is just 1,

00:00:20.831 --> 00:00:21.664
so this,

00:00:21.664 --> 00:00:23.142
it'll just end up being a sub zero,

00:00:23.142 --> 00:00:26.039
but that could be a weighted
cosine, if you want to view it

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.710
that way, and in the last video,

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.601
we started leveraging
some of the integrals,

00:00:30.601 --> 00:00:32.888
definite integrals of sines and cosines

00:00:32.888 --> 00:00:35.459
to establish a formula for a sub zero

00:00:35.459 --> 00:00:39.059
which intuitively ended up
being the average value of

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.770
our function over,

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.356
over 1 of its period,

00:00:42.356 --> 00:00:44.194
or over zero to 2 pi

00:00:44.194 --> 00:00:47.279
which is the interval
that we are caring about.

00:00:47.279 --> 00:00:50.228
What I want to do now is
find a general expression for

00:00:50.228 --> 00:00:53.554
a sub n, where n is not equal to zero.

00:00:53.554 --> 00:00:56.143
So for n is greater than zero,

00:00:56.143 --> 00:00:57.761
for n is an integer greater than zero

00:00:57.761 --> 00:01:00.311
and I'm going to use a very similar,

00:01:00.311 --> 00:01:02.157
a very similar technique.

00:01:02.157 --> 00:01:03.996
To figure out a sub zero, I just multiply,

00:01:03.996 --> 00:01:06.225
I just took the integral of both sides.

00:01:06.225 --> 00:01:10.156
What I'm going to do now is
I'm going to multiply both

00:01:10.156 --> 00:01:13.406
sides of this equation by cosine of nt.

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:15.793
So let me do that,

00:01:15.793 --> 00:01:17.854
so on the left-hand side,
I'm going to multiply by

00:01:17.854 --> 00:01:21.012
cosine of nt, and on the right-hand side,

00:01:21.012 --> 00:01:22.502
multiplying it by cosine of nt,

00:01:22.502 --> 00:01:25.029
if I distribute that cosine
of nt, I'm going to multiply

00:01:25.029 --> 00:01:27.128
every term by cosine nt.

00:01:27.128 --> 00:01:30.457
So it's going to be cosine of nt,

00:01:30.457 --> 00:01:32.358
cosine of nt,

00:01:32.358 --> 00:01:33.707
you might see where this is going,

00:01:33.707 --> 00:01:36.382
especially 'cause we took
all that trouble to take,

00:01:36.382 --> 00:01:38.926
to figure out the properties of,

00:01:38.926 --> 00:01:40.265
of definite integrals.

00:01:40.265 --> 00:01:41.683
Cosine of nt,

00:01:41.683 --> 00:01:42.766
cosine of nt,

00:01:44.388 --> 00:01:46.127
cosine of nt,

00:01:46.127 --> 00:01:47.355
or the properties of definite integrals

00:01:47.355 --> 00:01:49.665
of products of cosines and sines.

00:01:49.665 --> 00:01:51.546
Cosine of nt.

00:01:51.546 --> 00:01:53.328
And this is going to be
true for all of the terms.

00:01:53.328 --> 00:01:54.704
There's an infinite number of terms here.

00:01:54.704 --> 00:01:56.318
That's what that dot,
dot, dot is representing.

00:01:56.318 --> 00:01:58.936
We're just going to keep
on going on and on and on.

00:01:58.936 --> 00:02:01.320
And now, let's take the
definite integral of both sides

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.005
from zero to 2 pi.

00:02:03.005 --> 00:02:06.126
So the definite integral
from zero to 2 pi,

00:02:06.126 --> 00:02:09.704
dt, well that's going to
be the integral of this,

00:02:09.704 --> 00:02:11.287
from zero to 2 pi, and
actually, let me just take

00:02:11.287 --> 00:02:13.103
that coefficient out of the integral,

00:02:13.103 --> 00:02:14.770
so zero to 2 pi, dt,

00:02:16.999 --> 00:02:18.666
so zero to 2 pi, dt,

00:02:20.204 --> 00:02:22.491
a little bit monotonous but it's worth it,

00:02:22.491 --> 00:02:23.908
zero to 2 pi, dt,

00:02:25.616 --> 00:02:27.033
zero to 2 pi, dt,

00:02:28.807 --> 00:02:30.849
we might as well have fun while we do it,

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:32.266
zero to 2 pi, dt,

00:02:34.869 --> 00:02:35.797
all right.

00:02:35.797 --> 00:02:36.819
Zero, my hand is hurting,

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:38.236
zero to 2 pi, dt,

00:02:39.307 --> 00:02:40.724
zero to 2 pi, dt,

00:02:42.669 --> 00:02:44.405
once again, just integration property.

00:02:44.405 --> 00:02:45.898
I'm taking the integral from zero,

00:02:45.898 --> 00:02:47.390
the definite integral from zero to 2 pi

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.065
of both sides, and I'm just
saying, hey, the integral

00:02:50.065 --> 00:02:52.574
of this infinite sum is
equal to the infinite sum

00:02:52.574 --> 00:02:54.402
of the different integrals.

00:02:54.402 --> 00:02:56.846
Now, what is this going to be equal to?

00:02:56.846 --> 00:02:57.970
Well, we know,

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:59.853
we know from before that if I just take

00:02:59.853 --> 00:03:02.971
the definite integral from
zero to 2 pi of cosine nt,

00:03:02.971 --> 00:03:05.641
where n is some non-zero integer,

00:03:05.641 --> 00:03:06.831
this is just going to be zero,

00:03:06.831 --> 00:03:08.803
so this whole thing is going to be zero.

00:03:08.803 --> 00:03:11.624
We also know, and we've
established it before,

00:03:11.624 --> 00:03:13.170
if we take,

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.985
so I just used this property,

00:03:14.985 --> 00:03:18.331
we also know if we take
cosine nt times sine of mt

00:03:18.331 --> 00:03:21.599
for any integers mt over the
interval from zero to 2 pi,

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:23.494
that's going to be zero,

00:03:23.494 --> 00:03:25.262
and we also know,

00:03:25.262 --> 00:03:28.718
we also know that if we take
the integral of cosine mt,

00:03:28.718 --> 00:03:30.662
cosine nt, where m does not equal n,

00:03:30.662 --> 00:03:32.745
where m does not equal n,

00:03:34.018 --> 00:03:36.518
then that is going to be zero.

00:03:38.035 --> 00:03:39.368
And so, we know,

00:03:40.431 --> 00:03:41.951
well, here, we have,

00:03:41.951 --> 00:03:43.345
we're assuming that,

00:03:43.345 --> 00:03:46.427
we're assuming here that
n is not equal to 1,

00:03:46.427 --> 00:03:49.528
the coefficient here, so that
is going to be equal to zero.

00:03:49.528 --> 00:03:52.344
This is sines and cosines with
the different coefficients,

00:03:52.344 --> 00:03:54.445
and frankly, if they had
the same coefficient,

00:03:54.445 --> 00:03:55.333
that's going to be zero.

00:03:55.333 --> 00:03:57.474
We established that in
the last few videos.

00:03:57.474 --> 00:03:58.606
This is going to be zero,

00:03:58.606 --> 00:03:59.439
same argument.

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:00.272
This is going to be zero,

00:04:00.272 --> 00:04:01.105
this is going to be zero.

00:04:01.105 --> 00:04:03.076
Everything's going to be
zero except for this thing

00:04:03.076 --> 00:04:04.489
right over here,

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:05.859
but what is this thing?

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:07.162
This is the definite,

00:04:07.162 --> 00:04:08.297
what we're taking the integral of,

00:04:08.297 --> 00:04:12.214
this is the same thing
as cosine-squared of nt,

00:04:13.422 --> 00:04:15.559
dt, the definite integral
from zero to 2 pi

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:17.863
of cosine-squared nt, dt.

00:04:17.863 --> 00:04:19.535
Well, what is that?

00:04:19.535 --> 00:04:22.273
Well, we established that for any m,

00:04:22.273 --> 00:04:25.920
non-zero m, this is
going to be equal to pi.

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.825
So all our work is paying off.

00:04:27.825 --> 00:04:30.327
So, this whole integral,

00:04:30.327 --> 00:04:32.585
this whole integral right
over here is going to evaluate

00:04:32.585 --> 00:04:33.418
to pi.

00:04:33.418 --> 00:04:34.603
We did that in another video

00:04:34.603 --> 00:04:37.539
and so now we can start
solving for a sub n.

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:40.822
We know that a sub n times pi,

00:04:40.822 --> 00:04:42.239
a sub n times pi,

00:04:44.061 --> 00:04:45.811
times pi is equal to,

00:04:47.206 --> 00:04:49.946
is equal to this 'cause everything
else ended up being zero

00:04:49.946 --> 00:04:52.060
which is very nice.

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:56.087
It's equal to the definite
integral from zero to 2 pi

00:04:56.087 --> 00:04:56.920
of f of t,

00:04:58.074 --> 00:05:00.241
of f of t times cosine nt,

00:05:02.388 --> 00:05:03.805
cosine of nt, dt.

00:05:06.857 --> 00:05:10.851
Cosine of nt, dt, and so we
can now solve for a sub n.

00:05:10.851 --> 00:05:13.382
We just divide both sides by,

00:05:13.382 --> 00:05:15.382
we just divide both sides by pi,

00:05:15.382 --> 00:05:17.753
and we get a sub n is equal to,

00:05:17.753 --> 00:05:19.611
I think we deserve a
little bit of a drum roll,

00:05:19.611 --> 00:05:22.920
a sub n is equal to 1 over pi,

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:24.602
times all of this business,

00:05:24.602 --> 00:05:28.435
times the definite
integral from zero to 2 pi,

00:05:29.797 --> 00:05:30.630
f of t,

00:05:31.558 --> 00:05:32.391
f of t,

00:05:33.636 --> 00:05:34.469
cosine nt,

00:05:36.119 --> 00:05:36.952
cosine nt,

00:05:40.181 --> 00:05:41.014
dt.

00:05:41.914 --> 00:05:43.577
Dt.

00:05:43.577 --> 00:05:46.709
So if you want to find the
nth coefficient for one of our

00:05:46.709 --> 00:05:48.491
cosines, a sub n,

00:05:48.491 --> 00:05:50.377
well, you take your
function, multiply it times

00:05:50.377 --> 00:05:54.122
cosine of nt, and then
take that definite integral

00:05:54.122 --> 00:05:57.511
from zero to 2 pi, and then divide by pi,

00:05:57.511 --> 00:05:59.364
so pretty intuitive, and what's cool is

00:05:59.364 --> 00:06:01.151
that the math kind of works out this way,

00:06:01.151 --> 00:06:03.648
that you can actually do this,

00:06:03.648 --> 00:06:06.871
so hopefully you enjoyed
that as much as I did.
