you need to make a syllable vowels sit

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:36.940
you need to make a syllable vowels sit
 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.790
you need to make a syllable vowels sit
at the heart of the syllable which is

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:38.800
at the heart of the syllable which is
 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.680
at the heart of the syllable which is
actually called the nucleus of the

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:40.690
actually called the nucleus of the
 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.170

syllable consonants are built around

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.180
syllable consonants are built around
 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.959
syllable consonants are built around
that nucleus consonants before the vowel

00:00:45.959 --> 00:00:45.969
that nucleus consonants before the vowel
 

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:47.970
that nucleus consonants before the vowel
before the nucleus are part of the

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:47.980
before the nucleus are part of the
 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.880
before the nucleus are part of the
syllables on set there may be one or

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:50.890
syllables on set there may be one or
 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.119
syllables on set there may be one or
more consonants in the onset consonants

00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:54.129
more consonants in the onset consonants
 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:56.400
more consonants in the onset consonants
after the vowel after the nucleus are

the syllable so we can have syllables

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:02.379
the syllable so we can have syllables
 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:04.380
the syllable so we can have syllables
with consonants before the nucleus and

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390
with consonants before the nucleus and
 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.750
with consonants before the nucleus and
then after we can have syllables with

then after we can have syllables with
 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.670
then after we can have syllables with
consonants after the nucleus and none

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680
consonants after the nucleus and none
 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.830
consonants after the nucleus and none
before we can have a syllable with

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840
before we can have a syllable with
 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.840
before we can have a syllable with
consonants both before and after the

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850
consonants both before and after the
 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.970
consonants both before and after the
nucleus we can even have syllables with

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:14.980
nucleus we can even have syllables with
 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:18.290

no onset and no coda just a nucleus

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:18.300
no onset and no coda just a nucleus
 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.490

languages have different ways of

languages have different ways of
 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:21.690
languages have different ways of
building a syllable

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700
building a syllable
 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.150
building a syllable
for instance in Japanese you tend to

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:24.160
for instance in Japanese you tend to
 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.910
for instance in Japanese you tend to
hear syllables that end in a vowel

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920
hear syllables that end in a vowel
 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.590
hear syllables that end in a vowel
syllables don't have consonants after

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600
syllables don't have consonants after
 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.130
syllables don't have consonants after
the nucleus these open syllables have

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140
the nucleus these open syllables have
 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.190
the nucleus these open syllables have
just a vowel or a consonant plus vowel

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200
just a vowel or a consonant plus vowel
 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.040
just a vowel or a consonant plus vowel
the vowel can be long or it can be short

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.050
the vowel can be long or it can be short
 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.320
the vowel can be long or it can be short
but you'll still stop there so the next

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.330
but you'll still stop there so the next
 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.120
but you'll still stop there so the next
consonant would be part of the following

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130
consonant would be part of the following
 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.880

syllable in English however we can have

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890
syllable in English however we can have
 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.120
syllable in English however we can have
open syllables just like Japanese but we

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130
open syllables just like Japanese but we
 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.310
open syllables just like Japanese but we
also find fairly overloaded syllables

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320
also find fairly overloaded syllables
 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.890
also find fairly overloaded syllables
that involve three consonants before and

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:52.900
that involve three consonants before and
 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.050
that involve three consonants before and
three consonants after the vowel nucleus

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060
three consonants after the vowel nucleus
 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.870
three consonants after the vowel nucleus
in all cases you can still use the

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880
in all cases you can still use the
 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.690
in all cases you can still use the

we haven't yet touched on more complex
vowel nuclei like diphthongs when we

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979
vowel nuclei like diphthongs when we
 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.890

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800
syllable there are vowel type sounds
 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.430

like the glides yo and Wu which are

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440
like the glides yo and Wu which are
 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.120
like the glides yo and Wu which are
represented in IPA like a J and a W yeah

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130
represented in IPA like a J and a W yeah
 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.790

and Wu are treated as consonant sounds

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800
and Wu are treated as consonant sounds
 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.950
and Wu are treated as consonant sounds
but their vowel like sounds that can

nucleus is simply held longer it's the

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190
nucleus is simply held longer it's the
 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.940

same vowel but it's held out for a
 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.670
same vowel but it's held out for a
longer time you can represent such long

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680
longer time you can represent such long
