00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.500
Good imagery makes us form
a connection to the subject,

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.180
sympathizing with their joy,
pain, or delight.

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.380
Though only visual,

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:11.540
a good image might even make us
recall a familiar smell or sound.

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.270
Migrant Mother by Dorothea Lange
is the iconic representation of

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:17.791
the Great Depression
in the United States.

00:00:17.791 --> 00:00:22.273
In it, we see a mother with a steely
gaze into the future unsure of the end

00:00:22.273 --> 00:00:23.781
of her current crisis.

00:00:23.781 --> 00:00:27.939
It put a face and a feeling to what
migrant workers were experiencing during

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:29.261
the Great Depression.

00:00:29.261 --> 00:00:33.984
Afghan Girl by Steve McCurry appeared
on the cover of National Geographic in

00:00:33.984 --> 00:00:35.031
June 1985.

00:00:35.031 --> 00:00:38.746
It's one of these most recognizable
magazine covers ever, and

00:00:38.746 --> 00:00:42.066
has become a symbol of the status
of refugees worldwide.

00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:46.989
So, what do these two moving photographs
have to do with Android design?

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:48.150
A lot.

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.890
Though they come from different eras,
both tell an immersive and

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.686
compelling story and
can connect emotionally.

00:00:54.686 --> 00:00:57.960
Neither feels like stop imagery or
clip-art.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.600
While every photo or illustration you
use need not be Pulitzer Prize quality,

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.850
you should seek to select imagery
that is relevant to the user,

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.270
provides contextual information,
or delights them.
