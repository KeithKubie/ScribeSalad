so now some of the problems with with
 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.660
so now some of the problems with with
the Marxist perspective seems to be that

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:07.670
the Marxist perspective seems to be that
 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:09.830
the Marxist perspective seems to be that
victimhood the sense of enhanced

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840
victimhood the sense of enhanced
 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.600
victimhood the sense of enhanced
victimhood tends to produce an intense

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610
victimhood tends to produce an intense
 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.310
victimhood tends to produce an intense
sense of resentment and that's a very

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320
sense of resentment and that's a very
 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.200
sense of resentment and that's a very
bad idea because resentment is a very

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210
bad idea because resentment is a very
 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.200
bad idea because resentment is a very
toxic and violent emotion it's also very

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210
toxic and violent emotion it's also very
 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.970
toxic and violent emotion it's also very
ungrateful which is one of the things I

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980
ungrateful which is one of the things I
 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.769
ungrateful which is one of the things I
would really say about especially the

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779
would really say about especially the
 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.380
would really say about especially the
radical left student types especially at

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390
radical left student types especially at
 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.240
radical left student types especially at
Ivy League universities I mean it's

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250
Ivy League universities I mean it's
 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.460
Ivy League universities I mean it's
really quite a spectacle to see people

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470
really quite a spectacle to see people
 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.240
really quite a spectacle to see people
at places like Yale come out and agitate

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250
at places like Yale come out and agitate
 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.670
at places like Yale come out and agitate
as a consequence of the realization of

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680
as a consequence of the realization of
 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.410
as a consequence of the realization of
their own oppression when by any

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420
their own oppression when by any
 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.209
their own oppression when by any
reasonable standard current or

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219
reasonable standard current or
 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.569
reasonable standard current or
historical they're probably in the top

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:40.579
historical they're probably in the top
 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:43.700
historical they're probably in the top
1/100 of a percent perhaps better than

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710
1/100 of a percent perhaps better than
 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.470
1/100 of a percent perhaps better than
that of all the people who have ever

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480
that of all the people who have ever
 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.630
that of all the people who have ever
lived anywhere ever

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640
lived anywhere ever
 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.990
lived anywhere ever
and so it really it's really it's really

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000
and so it really it's really it's really
 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.510
and so it really it's really it's really
quite staggering to me that the top

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520
quite staggering to me that the top
 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.180
quite staggering to me that the top
point zero zero one percent can express

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190
point zero zero one percent can express
 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.279
point zero zero one percent can express
their resentment about the top point

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289
their resentment about the top point
 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.400
their resentment about the top point
zero zero zero one percent in such

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410
zero zero zero one percent in such
 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.009
zero zero zero one percent in such

exactly the same claims of privilege

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320
exactly the same claims of privilege
 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.590
exactly the same claims of privilege

you're doing the the privilege
 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.109
you're doing the the privilege
comparisons and that becomes immediately

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119
comparisons and that becomes immediately
 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:19.969
comparisons and that becomes immediately
self-evident and you know the fact that

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979
self-evident and you know the fact that
 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.070

to me to be very ungrateful at the least

to me to be very ungrateful at the least

socioeconomically because that's pretty

socioeconomically because that's pretty
much the only way they defined well off

which is also something I take great

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610
which is also something I take great
 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.050
which is also something I take great
objection to because there's lots of

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060
objection to because there's lots of
 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.820
objection to because there's lots of
hierarchies in the world and there are

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830
hierarchies in the world and there are
 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.920

many important hierarchies and not all

many important hierarchies and not all
 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.199
many important hierarchies and not all
of them can be reduced to socio-economic

imagine if you were 80 years old and you
 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.470
imagine if you were 80 years old and you
had twenty million dollars you know you

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480
had twenty million dollars you know you
 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.420
had twenty million dollars you know you
might be perfectly happy to get rid of

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430
might be perfectly happy to get rid of
 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.070
might be perfectly happy to get rid of
all that money if you could be 18 again

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080
all that money if you could be 18 again
 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.229
all that money if you could be 18 again
so it's and you know one of the best

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239
so it's and you know one of the best
 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:48.120
so it's and you know one of the best
predictors of wealth in North America is

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130
predictors of wealth in North America is
 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.670
predictors of wealth in North America is
actually age because you know young

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680
actually age because you know young
 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.440
actually age because you know young
people haven't actually had much time to

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450
people haven't actually had much time to
 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.120
people haven't actually had much time to
make money whereas old people have had

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130
make money whereas old people have had
 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:55.949
make money whereas old people have had
quite a bit of time but the problem with

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959
quite a bit of time but the problem with
 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:57.420
quite a bit of time but the problem with
being old and rich is that you're still

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430
being old and rich is that you're still
 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.420
being old and rich is that you're still
old and that actually turns out to be

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430
old and that actually turns out to be
 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.940
old and that actually turns out to be
quite a serious problem because no

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950
quite a serious problem because no
 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.830
quite a serious problem because no

problems of the suffering of life and we

chasing you around essentially something
like the beginnings of a middle-class

like the beginnings of a middle-class
 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.440
like the beginnings of a middle-class

psychological well-being and that's
actually an indication of the

actually an indication of the
