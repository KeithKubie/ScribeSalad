00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.040
Usually I have to take something to see shit like this. What the hell are you guys doing?

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.160
Preparing for the new law they're about to pass.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.660
What law?

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:54.920
The one that will abolish crime.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:55.500
What law?

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.960
Yet will spread chaos in its wake!

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:57.460
What law?!

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.300
It will ethically destroy what humanity stands for!

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.120
WHAT LAW?!

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.540
The law to split up Pinky and the Brain.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:06.460
That's not a law.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:07.100
It could be.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.600
No, it can't.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:08.620
It makes so much sense.

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:09.200
It clearly doesn't.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.000
It just seems like the road America's going down.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.300
Its amazing how much it's not.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.200
And how would you know, Mr. Expert?

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.400
Because it has nothing to do with crime. Crime is about breaking the law for your own personal gain,

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.420
and this amazingly has nothing to do with that.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.500
It doesn't matter. We've set up security perimeters all around the studio just in case it causes world wide panic.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.800
I suspect it would cause world wide indifference.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.200
But haven't you seen "The Purge"?

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.000
PUR-!! Fuck!
That dumbass movie everybody fell for?!

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.040
Hey! If that could happen, then so could splitting up Pinky and the Brain!

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.060
It's not fair, just as they're legalizing gay marriage.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:45.300
The Purge wouldn't happen. It never could happen, and that's why its so baffling it was such a success!

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.200
Nostalgia Critic: With its sequel having come out and having it be number one again at the box office,

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.060
Well...almost number one.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.340
"...damn dirty ape!"

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.800
The Purge is one of those surprise hits
that literally nobody can identify with.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:09.400
The idea is the not-too-distant future has basically abolished crime because one night a year 
they made crime legal.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:16.640
An interesting idea for a dark satire or maybe a clever comedy but no, the film plays it out like this could really happen

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:22.580
And that we shouldn't let it happen because apparently we're too stupid to realize its a bad idea.

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.120
Just look at how ridiculously 
serious it takes its advertising.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.620
[Choir sings "America The Beautiful"]

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:46.840
Yes. Nothing like a version of "O' Beautiful" being sung to blood gushing, innocent killing, homicidal psychotic slaughtering families.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.620
Now, if a gay or ethnic person sang it,
that'd be called for outrage.

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:56.100
Hell, maybe America's more fucked up then we realized if we're dumb enough not only to take this shit seriously but  also give it a squeal

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:04.000
Lets see how this movie shows what the flying hell is wrong with us even if it does it in a way that wasn't intended.

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.820
So let's not waste any time...

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.840
Will you guys knock it off!?

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.300
This is--, 
[gun shot] 
"The Purge."

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.500
["Duck Hunt" victory theme plays]

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.180
We see the film opens in the year 2022.

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:24.420
Yep, we only have 8 years 
until this plan is put into place.

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.540
We're so close America, it could happen any day!

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.840
I think its more likely we'll be dressing like this in a few months then having the purge in a few years.

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:41.400
Aw, yes, and just to give you a taste at how subtle 
and non-pretentious this film's gonna be,

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.360
here's a bunch of intense violence set to calming music.

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.380
[soothing music plays]

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:55.040
Because it's irony! They don't fit together!
But will the future know that?

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:56.480
[dramatic crescendo]

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.400
and just when you're wondering 
how an intro could be any less subtle,

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.240
one hell of a puzzle piece falls into your lap.

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.780
Now it makes sense! 
Suddenly, so many elements come together!

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.400
I could just see good old Bay 
getting high off his ass one night saying:

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:19.840
"I wanna feel deep, but I don't want to have to 
use my brain for it...Where's that Purge script?"

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.200
The film opens with a home security salesman 
named James, played by Ethan Hawke.,

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:30.540
driving home on the day of the Purge noticing quite an unrealistic amount of people still in their neighborhoods.

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.520
James: "Getting one last walk in before lock down, huh?"

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:33.140
Mr. Cali: "Yeah."

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:34.960
James: "Did you do the system 
check I recommended?"

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.380
"Of course, no problems."

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:42.540
Nostalgia Critic: Uh, if I knew crime was gonna be legal in 24 hours, I'd probably tell my family:

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.960
Hey gang! How about that vacation to Canada?

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.420
Just one of those friendly weekend visits to the 
Ned Flanders of North America.

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.800
Though, the more I think about it, 
they may not be the safest either.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.160
"Its a rape whistle."
What the fuck?

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:58.560
People put out flowers to show they support the Purge, others talk on the radio about what kind of crimes they're gonna do.

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.020
Radio: "Pete from Northern Virginia, 
what's your Purge plan?"

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.180
Pete: "I'm gonna hunt down my boss. 
That son of a bitch has it coming!"

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:07.820
Nostalgia Critic: Well, hopefully Pete from Northern Virginia's boss doesn't listen to the radio,

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:08.900
fucking idiot.

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:13.680
And even guys in lab coats explain the 
totally believable way the purge works.

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.120
Scientist: "We are inherently a violent species."

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:20.680
"Wars, genocide, murder, 
the denial of our true selves is the problem."

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:25.000
"The Purge not only contains societal 
violence to a single evening,

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:31.620
"But the country-wide catharsis creates psychological stability by letting us release 
the aggression we all have inside of us."

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.620
Nostalgia Critic: Oh, of course!

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:38.240
Terrorists, drug dealers, embezzlers, 
people with aggressive mental disorders,

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:41.160
all they needed to do was just let out a little aggression.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.120
It was so simple the whole time!

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.560
Good Lord, do you know how many 
crime shows would have ended differently

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.800
if we knew about THAT from the beginning?

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.340
Walter White: "Alright, Gus. If I'm going to cook for you,"

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:58.880
"I need to know that you're going to kill everybody who would get in the way of distribution, especially yourself!"

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:04.260
"Before turning to such a violent route, 
have you ever considered hitting a pillow?"

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.020
"A Pillow?"

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:09.600
"Yes. You'll find it strangely...relaxing."

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:15.620
"My God, you're right!"

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:18.140
"My mental instability is suddenly leveling out!"

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:20.760
"Now I don't need to make meth anymore!"

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:22.760
"Maybe I'll open that puppy farm."

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:23.860
"I'm glad to hear it."

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.940
"Now, for God's sake...
please put on a pair of pants."

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:31.660
"Not until you promise me a cameo in Better Call Saul!"

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:37.840
Nostalgia Critic: So, James has a wife named Mary, played by Lena Headey, who spends most of her time fighting off jealous neighbors.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.160
Grace: "You know, not everyone 
had the year you did, Mary."

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:44.660
"You know, some people are actually saying 'this neighborhood paid for that new addition on your home'."

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:46.660
"Are people really saying that?"

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:50.480
"Relax, it's just good old neighborhood
 gossip, nothing to worry about."

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:55.300
Nostalgia Critic: "I might be passive aggressive, 
but tonight I'll be AGGRESSIVE aggressive."

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:56.180
Grace: "Ty!"

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:59.740
Mr. Halverson: "Ooh, cookies! I hope you're hungry. Those cookies are crazy good."

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:00.540
[chuckling]

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:03.040
"They're lovely. Have a safe night, ladies."

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:04.080
"Bye."
-"Goodbye."

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:08.480
Nostalgia Critic: "Well, we established ourselves. 
Can't wait to show up obviously just for the climax!"

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:10.660
Woven like a quilt.

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:14.660
And even before the Purge, a little bit of 
creeping seems to be going around.

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:16.220
[ominous music plays]

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:19.880
[gasps]

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:22.020
"Christ..."

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:24.400
"You scared me to death."

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:26.880
Nostalgia Critic: Yeah, you really got me there, movie.

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:32.840
For a second, I swore a tiny tiny 
tiny tiny person was going to kill her.

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:33.940
Good fake out.

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:38.840
This device was made by their son, Charlie, 
who seems to enjoy monitoring his heart rate.

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:43.280
"I'm sorry, I forgot to take my vitals earlier. By the way, there's a slight deviation in my heart rate,"

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:45.620
"But uh, other than that, nothing to worry about."

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:48.900
Nostalgia Critic: It's never explained why 
and never comes back into the movie later,

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:51.600
it's just something he kind of likes to do.

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:55.600
Quirks, replacing character identity 
since the beginning of this movie.

00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:57.740
They also have a daughter named Zoey,

00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:01.400
Who's moody because her dad does 
not approve of her 18-year-old boyfriend.

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:05.200
Charlie: "In English, I wrote a story 
about a man whose love is so powerful,"

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:06.340
-"cuts out his own heart"

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:08.180
Zoey: "You know, he should have cut off his own penis."

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:11.300
"Z-Zoey!"
"Eating dinner! No penises!"

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:12.500
"Yeah, come on!"

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:14.240
"And Charlie, don't encourage her!"

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:17.840
Nostalgia Critic: "Kids, do I have to savagely
 mutilate you during the Purge?"

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:20.460
Nostalgia Critic: "I'm guessing this world just 
thinks we're all good parents for some reason,"

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:22.440
"But I can totally do that!"

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:23.540
[glass clinking]

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:25.340
"Guys, look what time it is."

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:29.360
"Oh, wow, it's later than I thought.
Alright, it's time for lockdown."

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:33.240
Nostalgia Critic: WOW! Can't believe 
we almost missed THAT little detail!

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:36.460
Oh, what, the Purge is starting?
Pfft! What-evs!

00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:39.100
It's not like we're missing an episode of "Chasing Life".

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:42.960
Hell, the movie starts by saying 
it's an hour until the Purge begins.

00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:48.760
That means they have to drive home, talk
 to neighbors, start dinner, set the table, eat dinner,

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:54.140
And prepare the security system during arguably
 the fastest sunset the town's ever known.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:58.260
Call me crazy, but I wouldn't leave so 
little time in between mental stability

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.000
and when death becomes the new selfie!

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.500
I mean, I know the rest of the world relies on the "Honor System" by not committing crimes the rest of the year,

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:09.660
But somebody could start early, 
catching you off your guard

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:12.460
and then leave the country 
while the cops are shut down.

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:16.360
Or do they "respect the Purge" 
too much to break the law?

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:17.240
[alarm blaring]

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:23.440
Automated Voice: "This is not a test.
Weapons of Class 4 and lower have been
 authorized for use during the Purge."

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:29.780
"Police, Fire and Emergency Medical Services will be unavailable until tomorrow morning at 7 a.m."

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.980
"Blessed be our New Founding Fathers
 and America, a nation reborn."

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:35.920
Nostalgia Critic: [scoffs] The New Founding Fathers.

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:41.660
I'm sure the speeches these "New Founding Fathers" gave fit in just as well as the other great leaders of the past.

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:46.900
Franklin D. Roosevelt
"The only thing we have to fear is fear itself."

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:53.700
John F. Kennedy
"Ask not what your country can do for you,
ask what you can do for your country!"

00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:54.680
"Just kill some people."

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:55.320
[applause]

00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:56.820
"Right? Right?"

00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:59.280
"It's a good idea, right?"

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:06.000
And just like before, the film praises the effectiveness 
of the Purge but never addresses mental illness,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.660
territory disputes, drug possession, or anything 
that doesn't fall under mere pent up rage.

00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:13.740
They just say "it works".

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:17.320
TV: "-eradication of these so-called 
non-contributing members of society."

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:18.940
"This night saved our country."

00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:21.920
TV: "Crime is down, the economy is flourishing."

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:22.980
"Because it works."

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:25.920
TV: "The undeniable fact is, this is working."

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:28.220
That's right, the Purge works.

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:32.260
Just like how somebody can take 65 million dollars 
and apparently make a film like Food Fight.

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:35.860
Don't question how illogical it is, it just works!

00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:40.320
One of the other phrases they seem to repeat 
a lot in this movie is "release the beast."

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:41.240
Radio: "-release the beast--,"

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:44.860
TV: "Release the beast--,"
-"Release the beast, boys, let the killing commence!"

00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:47.460
Nostalgia Critic: Quite a terrifying 
combination of words, right?

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:51.380
Ooh! I think I saw that in a Jägermeister ad once!

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:53.920
Stranger: "Help me! Someone, please!"

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:57.400
They see a homeless guy trying to 
hide from some violent kids by...

00:10:57.420 --> 00:10:59.260
"Can anybody hear me!?"

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.820
Screaming at the top of his lungs, that'll work.

00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:03.540
As the son decides to let him in.

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:06.580
James: "What the hell?"

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:09.580
Nostalgia Critic: Yep, the little kid opens the door.

00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:15.140
It's not like the top seller of the security system
 would actually be around his security system.

00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:20.780
Buddy, all that high-tech gadgetry doesn't do much
 if you give in to it's one simple design flaw.

00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:22.040
"The door..."

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:24.320
"must be closed!"

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:25.460
[audience laughing]

00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:33.520
To make things worse, Zoey's boyfriend snuck in before the lockdown and tells her that he wants to just talk to her dad about allowing him to date her.

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:35.580
Boyfriend: "Mr. Sandin..."

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:37.500
Mary: "James, he has a gun! Henry has a gun!"

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:38.320
[loud banging]

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:39.020
Mary: "Oh my God!"

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:41.400
Zoey: [screams] "Henry!"

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:43.840
Zoey: [cries] "Henry! Henry!"

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:46.380
Nostalgia Critic: "I still believe the Purge works, Honey!"

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:48.400
"Henry!"

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:53.280
Nostalgia Critic: "Talk went well...
Hit a few bumps but I think we can get past that."

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:54.080
"Henry..."

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:59.860
The boyfriend gets killed, but lo and behold, a group of young people approach the door, who were chasing the homeless man down.

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:03.440
[doorbell rings]

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:05.220
Nostalgia Critic: "Dick or Treat!"

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:11.620
Now, to this movie's credit, just when 
you think it's taking itself too seriously,

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:15.980
A saving grace simply known as Henry enters the film.

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:25.640
And, by god, he either takes absolutely none of this seriously or every single molecule of breath he takes on the set seriously.

00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:32.980
Either way, he is by far the most entertaining 
part of the film. Just watch this goof!

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:44.600
"We are some fine, young, very educated guys and gals ready to violate...annihilate and cleanse our souls."

00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:45.780

00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:49.280
Nostalgia Critic: He's got more ham 
than a Dr. Seuss book!

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:52.340
"Mr. and Mrs., the man you are sheltering 
is nothing but a dirty homeless pig."

00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:56.920
Henry: "A grotesque menace to our just society 
you have the audacity to fight back."

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:00.080
"Please, just let us purge."

00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:02.660
[laughs]

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:06.780
Nostalgia Critic: He's not gonna release the beast, 
he's gonna release the squee!

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:11.380
Henry: "If you don't deliver him by the aforementioned time, we'll release the beast on him..."

00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:15.140
"...And on you."

00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:20.020
"I just farted and it's gonna smell really bad."

00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:21.120
[snorting]

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:29.740
"We can enter any home we want and we will want
 as wanting is our will on this fine night."

00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:32.080
"What tha' hell does that mean?"

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:36.240
"You have until our provisions arrive, provisions which will help us break into your elegant home."

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:38.700
"Toodle-loo, Sandins."

00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:44.020
Nostalgia Critic: "Well...now we know what Macaulay Culkin does to every family who watches Richie Rich."

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:49.120
So the kids give them and hour before they try
 breaking in to have them hand the man over.

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:52.760
This results in the "suspenseful" part of the movie

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:56.120
where the go through the house 
with the power cut by the masked kids,

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:58.360
which would make it hard to find the guy, wouldn't it?

00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:00.280
They're obviously not gonna call the cops!

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:05.260
And I'm not kidding, 
the search goes on for fifteen minutes.

00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:11.120
Fifteen minutes of them just searching through the dark and us practically looking at nothing.

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:13.340
I don't even know who I'm supposed to be scared for.

00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:18.640
The family, of course, are the main characters and they're chasing an injured man crying for help.

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:21.340
Where the hell am I supposed to be afraid?

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:24.220
All the while, the children of the corny are taunting them,

00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:29.460
I guess, by doing non-scary things that are supposed 
to be scary because they have masks on.

[foreboding music plays]

00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:45.700
Nostalgia Critic: "Well, we've tried skipping and we've tried prancing, best continue to do a full on do-si-do!"

00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:50.500
Henry: "Dear, Mr. Sandin! --by your front door, 
I just need a moment to check ."

00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:55.360
Nostalgia Critic: But thankfully in the middle of their searching, we get yet another scene from dear young Henry.

00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:57.880
"Tell me, why having you delivered 
the filthy swine to me yet?"

00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:01.720
"Are you protecting him? 
I certainly hope not, Mr. Sandin."

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:03.220
James: "No, of course not."

00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:10.620
I'm sorry! I'm really trying, 
I'm trying so hard to be scared by this kid,

00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:13.680
But, he's just so fucking hilarious!

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:19.440
He's just projecting so much that he wants to be scary that it's actually kind of adorable.

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:22.780
I just want to pinch his little 
supposed-to-be-frightening cheeks!

00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:26.080
"GIVE US THE HOMELESS PIG YOU FUCK!"

00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:26.840
[gunshot]

00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:30.120
Henry: "Sorry about that. 
I don't condone that kind of behavior."

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:34.040
"He and that...will be thee."

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:39.180
Nostalgia Critic: Yeah, come on! You can trust a face like that on a night where all crime is supposed to be legal.

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:40.600
How can this go awry?

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:41.580
James: "I'll go get him."

00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:43.020
"You should do that."

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:47.380
Nostalgia Critic: Why are they even blowing 
all their time on this one damn house?

00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:54.440
They have one night out of the year to do whatever the hell they want and yet they spend it like 5th graders who just found out that they have cameras on their phones!

00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:59.180
What person would spend so much time 
to get into a person's house for such a weak reason?

00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:02.920
Malcom: Uh, Critic.
You might wanna take a look at this.

[suspenseful music plays]

00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:14.320
Film Brain?

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:19.820
Hello, Mr. Critic.
I heard you were reviewing the Purge.

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:22.240
Yeah, what about it?

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:26.740
You are aware that I reviewed the film 
on my projector series and...

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:33.560
I was rather surprised that you didn't 
ask me to do a crossover with you.

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:37.580
I just did a crossover Film Brain, 
if I did another one, it'd be too repetitive.

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:40.760
Mr. Critic, the film that you are 
watching is a dirty, brainless pile.

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:49.260
A film that has to audacity to exist in our culture film-going society and it deserves to be eradicated.

00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:54.900
Brutally...painfully...cripplingly.

00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:56.960
Geez, he really wanted to review this with me.

00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:59.680
(whispers) This is what happens when you 
try to split up Pinky and the Brain.

00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:00.480
Will you shut up!

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:07.180
Mr. Critic, I just want to splurge as I am so entitled. 
Oh, please let me splurge!

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:09.700
Film Brain, I'm sorry.
I can't do two in a row.

00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:11.780
Maybe another review in the future?

00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:14.340
Oh, I understand, of course.

00:17:14.340 --> 00:17:18.580
But the ten tons of dynamite I laid around you office...
Does not.

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:19.340
[gasps loudly]

00:17:19.340 --> 00:17:21.300
I thought this place smelled dynomitey!

00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:22.400
Film Brain, what the hell!?

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:26.540
That's right! I'm bonkers now 
and if you don't do a crossover with me

00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:30.520
I'm gonna decimate your asses 
sky high with my mobile phone!

00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:32.180

Malcolm: Your cellphone's the detonator?

00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:38.040
Oh, yeah. There's an app for that now.

00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:41.560
And I must be allowed to 
comment on this film's cheesiness.

00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:44.180
Just allow me to unleash to cheese!

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:47.460
Alright, alright, Film Brain.
Just give me time to write something up.

00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:49.680
How long, Mr. Critic?

00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:51.200
Commercial Break maybe?

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:54.640
Very well, but do not disappoint me.

00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:02.660
Anything else?

00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:06.440
No, I'm just allowing my scary performance to sink in.

[sighs] Fine.

Malcolm: You have to do a crossover.

00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:16.240
I can't! It'd be too redundant!

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:17.480
You'd risk your own life for that?

00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:18.440

Not really.
He's kind of skipping and prancing about.

00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:54.980
Tamara: I think he's too distracted 
about how evil he's trying to be.

00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:57.600
Good, I'm going to keep reviewing 
while you guys think of a plan.

00:18:57.640 --> 00:18:58.140
Right.

00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:02.060
(whispers) First, we don't tell him about 
the splitting up of Pinky and the Brain.

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:04.020
THEY'RE NOT SPLITTING UP!

00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:08.520
They do eventually catch the guy, but something convinces them not to hand him over,

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:13.900
and I use the word "something" because I literally have no idea what it is that convinces them not to do it.

00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:16.080
The daughter says "nothing will be the same,"

00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:19.920
hell, even the guy offers to hand 
himself over to end all the trouble.

"Save your children.
Take me outside."

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:25.220
And yet, for some reason, they decide to renege.

I'm not saying that what they're doing isn't the right thing,

00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:32.760
I'm just saying their explanation of how 
they came to that conclusion is about as solid as

00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:34.020
"Because it works."

00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:36.520

Nostalgia Critic: "That's so 
they don't come back as zombies."

00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:24.620
But just when he thinks he's gotten out okay...

00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:26.220
Oh, Henry.

00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:32.120
Okay, this character hasn't let me down yet,

00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:36.860
let's see how many traditional movie psychopath
 clichés we can fit into 30 seconds.

00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:38.960
Can we have the comforting killer?

00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:40.960
Henry: "Shh...Shh...it's okay."

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:43.820
The whimpering lip over the beauty of his actions?

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:48.760
How about the thankful gratitude 
for giving him such an experience?

00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:51.600
Henry: "Thank you for this 
unforgettable purge, Mr. Sandin."

00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:54.520
There better be a loving kiss in there!

00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:58.540
And top it all off with the 
straightening of his suit and hair,

00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:02.260
proving his look is far more 
important than the life of another.

00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:04.580
That's five!

00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:08.340
Five psychotic movie clichés in under 30 seconds!

00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:10.880
Oh, my God, Henry! 
Never ever die!

00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:11.900
[loud gunshots]

00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:14.640
NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!

00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:18.420
You killed the only enjoyable character in the film...

00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:21.480
He was filled with more ham than Ponyo!

00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:25.740
Great, now who's gonna drill our incredibly 
forced message into the ground!?

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:30.720
Oh, great, the characters who only existed 
so you would know who they are in the climax.

00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:32.440
Again, like a quilt.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:34.860

"James is dead, Mary and the kids will have to do."

00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:42.440
"Let's tie them up, we'll kill them right here."

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:43.420
Mary: "No, no, no, no, no, no...!"

00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:48.440
"When your barricades came down, we saw an opportunity to cleanse ourselves of our hatred."

00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:51.760
Yep, because that's how killers talk, everybody.

00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:58.500
"I'm sorry I gotta kill you, but the cleansing of my mortal coil has to be addressed if I'm to be ethically absolved."

00:23:59.060 --> 00:23:59.600
"...what?"

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:00.960
[loud gunshot bang]

00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:04.880
Grace: "You made so much money off of us 
and then you just stuck it in our faces!"

00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:08.100
"You all think you're so damn perfect!"

00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:12.120
Nostalgia Critic: "That, and you're cookies are awful! Now, we're going to kill you and both of your daughters!"

00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:16.920
Neighbors: "Blessed be the New Founding Fathers
 for letting us purge."

00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:22.100
So...this world is like Bioshock Infinite?

00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:25.480
Except with none of the cool stuff 
and double the hypocrisy?

00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:27.880
[gunshots bangs]

00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:30.460
But the homeless man comes in to save the day.

00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:35.120
Stranger: "Your call."
Grace: "Just get it over with. Kill us quickly."

00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:38.800
"Oh, for god's sake! Just do it!"

00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:39.900
"Come on!"

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.580
"The movie's almost over and Henry 
was the only entertaining thing anyway!"

00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:47.260
"We are gonna to play the rest of this night 
out in motherf*cking peace."

00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:52.480
So, as you heard, she forces everybody 
to sit politely until the Purge is over.

00:24:58.340 --> 00:25:01.640
Nostalgia Critic: "Bitch! 
A Lannister always pays her debts!"

00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:04.720

No more killing tonight!"

"See ya at the neighborhood barbecue!"

00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:18.460
Thus, they all go home and life goes on as 
[gasp] NORMAL??

00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:23.880
Radio: "Just after 7 a.m., March 22nd, 
the annual Purge has just concluded."

00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:26.860
"Our new Founding Fathers have just 
released an early statement saying:

00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:29.120
"This was the most successful purge yet."

00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:32.680
"But wait a minute, it wasn't successful..."

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:34.880
WAS IT??

00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:40.560
Shut the f*ck up!

00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:44.920
This is one of the most pretentious 
ideas I've ever seen in my entire life!

00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:48.680
I mean, who would actually be 
inspired by such a ludicrous idea?

00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:52.320
Tamara: Uh, Critic. Film Brain says 
he's done scarily frolicking.

00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:55.460
Film Brain: Time's up, Mr. Critic.

00:25:55.540 --> 00:25:57.500
Where's my review?

00:25:57.500 --> 00:26:01.100
[sighs] Well, I kind of just finished it up, Film Brain.

00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:02.160
What?

00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:04.080
YOU FAILED!

00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:08.340
No, no, no, no, no! I just want you to uh... 
finish it off with the closing thoughts.

00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:11.900
Really?
What would you have me say?

00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:13.760
Well...

00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:17.560
The point of this movie is to prove one thing:
That the Purge is bad.

00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:22.640
Well, since we already know that and not in a million years would we ever let something like this happen

00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:24.580
It's a pretty f*cking pointless message.

00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:29.740
Maybe if it was a dark comedy, 
an exploitation film or balls to the wall satire.

00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:34.860
But it explains nothing about how 
this idea could work except that "it works."

00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:40.240
Most of it is just showing people sneaking around the house like it's trying to be a gritty real life situation

00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:44.400
but since we know the logic is bullshit, 
there's no way to identify with it.

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:46.660
The only bit of fun is that Henry character.

00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:49.920
He at least does something totally
 batshit crazy and memorable.

00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:55.380
But for everything else, it's just a pretentious wannabe protest film that has nothing to protest.

00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:58.440
It's like that kid who wants attention in your writing class

00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:05.440
so he writes what he thinks is ground-breaking commentary when really it's just someone complaining about how there's nothing to complain about.

00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:08.420
It's a stupid ridiculous mess.

00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:11.220
Well, yeah, I can say that and--

00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:14.060
Wait a minute, you already said that!

00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:15.380
Oh, yeah. Oops.

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:19.900
Film Brain: So I bid thee farewell, Critic.
Unleash the cheese!

00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:23.040
NOOOOOOOO!!!!

00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:30.380
Oh, bloody hell! Come on!

00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:34.520
Yes, I am going to file a complaint later!

00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:39.080
Alright, fine. Okay, okay let's do this...
Kick the door down.

we were ever afraid of this guy.

in my top ten most awkward life moments,

At least Pinky and the Brain are still together.

00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:18.320
Pinky and the Brain are not splitting up!

00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:21.300
Pinky and the Brain are splitting up?

00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:25.600
Yeah, yeah, pretty devastating news, huh?

00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:29.040
Oh, my god! I love Pinky and the Brain!

00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:31.160
Yes, yes, we're all traumatized by it

00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:37.060
so much so that I bet you just want to go home, lie in bed and gorge on Turkish delight, don't you?

00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:41.620
Yeah...I-I-I think I do that...

Film Brain: [crying] Why is it celebrity
 couples never stay together??

00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:53.960
We have got to stop that crazy 
crumpet from ever coming back here.

00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:58.120
But how? Once he figures out the truth, 
he'll just come back and finish what he started.

self-fulfilling prophecy?

Duck Dynasty if none of the people are ducks?"

00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:18.840

at least one f*cking thing right!?"

if you didn't keep f*cking it up!"
