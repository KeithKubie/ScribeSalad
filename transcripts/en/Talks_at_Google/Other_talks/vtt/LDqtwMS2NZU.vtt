00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:03.040
MALE SPEAKER: So
welcome, everybody.

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:05.230
It's good to welcome
everybody here.

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:09.830
It's nice to also welcome
Craig Redmond from Mercy Corps.

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.880
Craig is the Mercy Corps Senior
Vice President of Programs.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.410
And for those of you, probably
mostly on VC, who don't know,

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:19.920
Mercy Corps is a
global organization

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.150
that helps people get
back on their feet

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.980
and survive, basically, in the
aftermath of natural disasters,

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.560
and in the wake of
economic crises,

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.200
or when conflict erupts--
basically any time when there

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.150
is an acute and/or
chronic challenge to peace

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.060
and stability and to progress.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.860
And their goal in
those times is to try

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.050
to connect people in need
with resources and expertise

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.839
to try to realize fundamental
and transformative change

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:49.380
in societies.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.380
And it's a very, very
worthy goal that, I think,

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:56.772
is something that resonates
deeply with folks at Google

00:00:56.772 --> 00:00:58.480
as evidenced by the
fact that we actually

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.300
have a long history, a long and
good history, with Mercy Corps.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.459
Mercy Corps has, I should
say, 4,000 members.

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:07.931
They live and work in
more than 40 countries.

00:01:07.931 --> 00:01:09.930
And they face some of the
world's most difficult

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.440
challenges, as you
will see today.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.530
But in terms of our history,
Google's history with Mercy

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.320
Corps, we have worked
closely with them

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.450
on a wide range of humanitarian
issues over the years.

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.940
I think Nepal is a
great example of that.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.170
For folks who don't
know, we collectively

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:34.410
generated about $1.1 million
of donations, grants,

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:41.800
et cetera for Mercy Corps in the
context of the Nepal disaster.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.460
And that was a combination
of Google.org giving,

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.070
a combination of Googlers
donating trips, credits,

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.050
and actual direct giving through
our GooglersGive for Disaster

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.410
Relief program, which
is company matched.

00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:00.050
And all of that meaningfully
aggregated to a good number

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.370
of $1.1 million plus.

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:05.530
And more than 1,900
Googlers participated

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.210
in that, which is both really
exciting to see but it also

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:11.160
is a real opportunity.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.410
Because by the way, we've
got about 60,000 employees.

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.160
So we could do a lot more.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.581
And maybe this talk will inspire
folks so that the next time we

00:02:21.581 --> 00:02:23.330
have an opportunity
to work with you guys,

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.620
that number doubles,
or triples, or even

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.430
grows by a much bigger number.

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.280
Mercy Corps also helped us
pioneer a new program, which

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.190
is-- this is a mouthful--
it's the GooglersGive Disaster

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.370
Corps, otherwise
known as the GDC.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:38.350
It's a neat idea.

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:43.850
The idea, really, is to match
disaster relief organizations

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.330
who have a specific need
in terms of expertise

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.720
or some kind of technical
need with Googlers

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.440
who have a desire and
an inclination to give.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.920
The name for this is
"philanthropic human capital

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.010
investment program
in disaster relief."

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.500
I don't know what-- I don't
know who came up with that name.

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:11.050
But I think that, more than
the money that provides,

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.860
that's an incredible
opportunity, both for you guys

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.030
but also for Googlers.

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.530
And I would really like to
promote this to all the folks

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.863
who are watching, because I
think, really, it's not just

00:03:19.863 --> 00:03:22.420
about giving money, but
it's about giving expertise

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.950
and help in times of need.

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.900
17 Googlers participated in the
Nepal program through, I think,

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:29.810
five NGOs.

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.340
I think Mercy Corps
was one of them,

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.040
and hosted Googlers for a
number of weeks in Nepal.

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.850
And you will hear from some
of those Googlers today.

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.830
Let me give you a
little bit about Craig.

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:44.900
Craig Redmond has worked in
international development

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:50.010
and humanitarian response
for over 22 years.

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.320
15 of those years have been
with Mercy Corps leading

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.860
regional and country
operations in the Caucasus,

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:00.010
the Horn of Africa, South
Asia, and Southeast Asia.

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:01.990
And in his current
role, he leads

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:03.940
Mercy Corps' global
programs, including

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.010
humanitarian response, program
development, and operations

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:08.330
around the world.

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.360
I think it's fair to say
that Craig has played

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:14.600
a major role in
Mercy Corps' approach

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:20.190
to creating real, transformative
change in times of great need.

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:25.780
And I think we will hear
about how they combine

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:30.000
big ideas and bold action
with an appreciation

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.550
of local sensibility
to really bring

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:33.990
about change in times of need.

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.175
And it's an inspiring story,
so I should stop talking.

00:04:37.175 --> 00:04:39.050
And I should actually
let you come up, Craig,

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:41.100
and we should start
to hear from you.

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.540
CRAIG REDMOND: Thank you.

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:42.831
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you, Craig.

00:04:42.831 --> 00:04:45.425
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:46.375 --> 00:04:47.800
CRAIG REDMOND: Thank you, Matt.

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.219
It's great to be here.

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:51.260
It's really a pleasure to
be here with all of you

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.170
to talk about-- I want to
talk to you about Nepal.

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:55.499
Where's the clicker?

00:04:55.499 --> 00:04:56.790
MALE SPEAKER: Just point at me.

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:57.305
I got you.

00:04:57.305 --> 00:04:58.388
CRAIG REDMOND: You got me.

00:04:58.388 --> 00:04:58.887
OK.

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:02.560
This is Google after all.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.470
I just point at somebody
and something-- fantastic.

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:08.430
Yeah, I want to talk
to you about Nepal.

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.620
And obviously, I'm
going to also talk

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.530
about the events that happened
in the spring, this spring.

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:15.560
But before we do that,
I want to tell you

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.190
what Nepal is really about.

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:20.130
Go ahead.

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:21.420
This is Nepal.

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:23.250
You know, any time,
unfortunately,

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:25.400
in places where we work,
there is a disaster,

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:26.858
or something terrible
has happened,

00:05:26.858 --> 00:05:28.610
or there's a conflict
of some kind--

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:31.320
but really, there's a
reality of the place.

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.619
Like Nepal, this is a
fantastic, even magical place.

00:05:34.619 --> 00:05:36.160
You know, I've been
there many times.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.930
I started going
there in the 90s.

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:39.770
I'm a climber.

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:42.120
In fact, I climbed
this peak right here.

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:42.935
This is Ama Dablam.

00:05:42.935 --> 00:05:44.810
You can see this beautiful
village down here.

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:46.620
And this is Everest,
right there.

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:51.560
This, for me, captures,
Nepal is a fantastic place,

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:52.660
beautiful place.

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:54.220
The people you
meet there who are

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.590
going there to visit go there
and talk about trekking.

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:58.590
And then they start
immediately talking about it

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:00.480
like some sort of
spiritual pilgrimage.

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:02.110
It's really a wonderful place.

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:04.500
Let's go to the next one.

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:06.680
This is a place called Tenboche.

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:09.240
It's a Tibetan monastery
not far from where

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:10.410
the other picture was taken.

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:14.430
So you can see, it's just
a rich, beautiful place

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:17.140
full of incredibly
resilient people.

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:19.217
And let's go to the next one.

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:25.820
And of course, on
the 20th of April,

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:28.270
there was a terrible earthquake.

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:32.820
And you here at Google also know
about that and you feel that.

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:34.160
You lost one of your own.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.380
Dan Fredinburg died in
that in an avalanche.

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:39.901
So this is also-- you
guys feel this very much.

00:06:39.901 --> 00:06:41.400
And so as I talk
through this, we'll

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:43.355
hold him and his
family in our hearts.

00:06:43.355 --> 00:06:46.621
It's a terrible loss.

00:06:46.621 --> 00:06:47.120
Terrible.

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:49.960
8,000 lives, in
excess of 8,000 lives,

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:53.440
were lost in just a few
minutes in that earthquake.

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.790
7.8 on the Richter scale.

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:58.910
Interestingly, Nepal
expected this to happen.

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:00.680
Of course, the
country sits right

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:03.400
on the two plates, the Indian
plate and the Eurasian Plate,

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:05.036
where they collide.

00:07:05.036 --> 00:07:05.910
That's the Himalayas.

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:07.260
That's why the
Himalayas are there.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:08.301
Let's go to the next one.

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:13.830
And because the
earthquake happened there,

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:16.490
it meant that communities,
local communities,

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:18.250
had to burst into
action very quickly.

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:19.970
In fact, the lives
that were saved there

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:22.760
in those early minutes
after the earthquake

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:25.130
were all local communities
who pulled their families

00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:29.369
and pulled community members
out of that terrible storm.

00:07:29.369 --> 00:07:30.660
And as I said, it was expected.

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:32.990
But in places all
over the world,

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:35.910
even though you know something
like this is likely to happen,

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:37.680
you're really never quite ready.

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:38.990
And this is one of those cases.

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:41.270
It was just a terrible,
terrible situation.

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:43.860
The next slide.

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:46.790
This is a village that I
visited in the weeks just

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:47.870
after the earthquake.

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:52.920
This is in Sindhupalchowk, which
is northeast from Kathmandu.

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:56.020
And above there is Langtang,
one of my favorite places

00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:56.730
in the world.

00:07:56.730 --> 00:07:59.010
It borders Tibet,
really beautiful place.

00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:00.851
This village was
one of the places

00:08:00.851 --> 00:08:02.350
where we visited
where, actually, we

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:03.650
did some of our early work.

00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:06.290
And in this place-- you can't
really tell from this picture,

00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:09.330
but you can see general
destruction-- about 2/3

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:12.470
of the houses were
destroyed there.

00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:16.500
And in the next slide, you'll
see a picture of this house.

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:18.779
This was really common
after the earthquake.

00:08:18.779 --> 00:08:21.320
You will walk along a street
and the houses will look normal.

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:22.560
And then you peek
around the side

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:24.360
and the whole side
of the house is gone.

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:26.540
So in fact, in another
village I was in,

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:29.120
something like
out of 100 houses,

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:30.650
only eight were left standing.

00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:35.330
So really extreme devastation
throughout that whole part

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:36.340
of the country.

00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:38.662
In some of the villages we
visited, if you can imagine,

00:08:38.662 --> 00:08:40.120
a house like this--
of course, this

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:43.174
is uninhabitable-- somebody
has to pull it down.

00:08:43.174 --> 00:08:44.840
We saw, in a few
places, where young men

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:46.790
were climbing on top of
the roofs of these houses

00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:48.706
and starting to tear
them down brick by brick.

00:08:48.706 --> 00:08:50.340
Not what you want to do.

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:52.840
But people just need to
get on with their lives.

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:53.496
Next slide.

00:08:55.902 --> 00:08:57.360
This is a guy called
[? Mishual. ?]

00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:00.710
We met him in one of the
villages where we worked.

00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:04.040
He told us a story of being,
actually, up on a ladder

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:07.090
fixing one of the lights
in the village when

00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:08.330
the earthquake happened.

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:10.413
And of course, he knew
immediately how bad it was.

00:09:10.413 --> 00:09:12.710
He saw houses around him
starting to collapse.

00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:15.641
Ran down, ran home, and
found his house collapsed.

00:09:15.641 --> 00:09:18.140
And his wife and his son there,
in the picture, were inside.

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:22.110
And he was able to dig them
out and save their lives.

00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:23.910
Really common story
where people talk

00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:26.340
about what they had to
do to pull family members

00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:29.310
and community members
out of the earthquake.

00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:32.300
In that same village,
I was walking along

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:33.760
and I saw this woman.

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:35.420
She was standing
next to a rubble,

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:38.959
a big pile of rubble bricks
and pieces of splintered wood.

00:09:38.959 --> 00:09:41.000
And she had a stick and
she was just poking at it

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.170
and turning over bricks.

00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:45.510
And she had just experienced
such complete loss

00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:48.320
that it was all that
she could imagine to do.

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:50.770
A very, very sad story there.

00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:52.960
Next slide.

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:55.250
This is Bhaktapur,
a World Heritage

00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:57.520
site built in the 15th century.

00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:58.530
Incredible place.

00:09:58.530 --> 00:09:59.560
Just a beautiful place.

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:01.890
This, in fact, is
my climbing partner,

00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:05.400
Josh Duwal right here--
Mercy Corps guy also--

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:06.780
and his beautiful family.

00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:08.280
And that was two years ago.

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:09.030
And we were there.

00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:12.280
And the next slide
shows it two weeks

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:15.140
after the earthquake
when I visited there.

00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:18.730
You can see, from that slide
as well, this incredible place

00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:22.180
with so much rich culture and
everything largely destroyed,

00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:23.410
very much of it destroyed.

00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:25.350
And some of the buildings that
are still standing, in fact,

00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:26.975
are leaning and are
going to have to be

00:10:26.975 --> 00:10:29.270
pushed over-- a real tragedy.

00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:31.460
Next slide.

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:36.240
So just as this horrible
tragedy happens,

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:40.670
it also creates an
opportunity for innovation.

00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:43.740
It creates an opportunity
for these communities

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:46.570
to emerge in a way that they
never thought possible before.

00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:48.530
And in fact, this is the
Google story as well.

00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:49.530
You guys were there.

00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:52.090
As Matt was saying, you
guys were there with us.

00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:55.160
We had this incredible
support from the employees

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:58.170
at Google, which was wonderful,
and the disaster corps

00:10:58.170 --> 00:10:59.392
team that was there with us.

00:10:59.392 --> 00:11:00.100
It was fantastic.

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:01.350
So this is your story as well.

00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:03.080
And I want to say a
few things about what

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:05.440
that recovery looked like.

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:08.340
In the minutes after,
in the hours after,

00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:10.500
in the days
immediately following

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:12.820
one of these disasters,
one of the first things

00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:17.900
you have to think about is
those absolute immediate needs

00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:19.380
families and
communities will have.

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:21.296
And they're always the
same thing-- basically,

00:11:21.296 --> 00:11:25.180
their shelter, their water,
their food, their sanitation.

00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:28.150
What we have to do is find ways
to deliver those things as fast

00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:30.540
as possible so that
people can survive

00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:32.860
those very difficult
days following

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:37.750
an earthquake, or a tsunami, or
a cyclone, or whatever it is.

00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:40.260
So like other NGOs, Mercy
Corps burst into action.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.906
You can see, this is us putting
together emergency kits.

00:11:42.906 --> 00:11:44.530
You've got your big
water buckets here.

00:11:44.530 --> 00:11:48.100
You've got jerrycans,
blankets, towels, soap,

00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:50.180
some sort of water
dispenser, the things

00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:52.260
that people will
need just to survive.

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.927
And we did this in
an interesting way.

00:11:54.927 --> 00:11:56.510
Right after the
earthquake, of course,

00:11:56.510 --> 00:11:57.880
people were just
scrambling to find

00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:59.220
whatever goods they could find.

00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:01.500
We sent 10 team members
in all directions

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:03.560
to procure as much as we
could so that we could

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:05.440
go and distribute these things.

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:07.440
Over the weeks after
the earthquake,

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:11.680
we distributed about
115,000 of these kits

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:15.384
in the earthquake-affected
areas north of Kathmandu.

00:12:15.384 --> 00:12:18.230
Next slide.

00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:20.870
And in fact, these are
boxers full of the same kits.

00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:23.550
And you can see that we
trucked them up, in some cases,

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:25.520
as far as we could,
unloaded them.

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:28.060
And then community members
came down to meet us.

00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:30.222
And so we did
distributions that way.

00:12:30.222 --> 00:12:32.797
Nepal, of course,
road system is,

00:12:32.797 --> 00:12:34.380
the further into the
mountains you go,

00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:35.750
the worse it gets
until, finally, there

00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:36.630
are no more roads.

00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:38.120
And you've got to go by foot.

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:41.290
And some of the things we
brought in by helicopter.

00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:44.870
Others we had-- the next slide
shows how they got there.

00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:46.600
So then, community
members come down.

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:48.590
You can see this
woman with a tumpline.

00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:51.420
This is the traditional
way of carrying goods.

00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:54.770
And by the way, these people
are incredibly powerful.

00:12:54.770 --> 00:12:56.920
The amount of weight they
can carry on their backs

00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:58.990
is just unbelievable.

00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:00.210
So they would come down.

00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:03.680
And they would
load up those goods

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:06.680
and carry them back and
either redistribute back

00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:09.580
in their villages or-- that's
for a number of families

00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:10.670
or whatever it is.

00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:12.272
So that's how it's done.

00:13:12.272 --> 00:13:14.230
And that's how it's done
in a place like Nepal.

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:15.646
And interestingly,
that's how it's

00:13:15.646 --> 00:13:19.502
done in so many countries
around the world.

00:13:19.502 --> 00:13:20.960
Immediately, when
you look at that,

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:23.080
you think, OK, it
has to be done.

00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:24.750
There's a critical
need for those goods

00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:26.950
to get into the hands of
people who need them most.

00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:31.580
But talk about a system
that's ripe for disruption.

00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:34.440
Something about it, something
about watching a distribution

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:37.510
just makes you think this
doesn't feel right somehow.

00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:40.510
Surely, there's a better
way that this can be done.

00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:41.800
And there is.

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:43.910
I'm not saying you
shouldn't do distributions.

00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:45.340
You should when it's necessary.

00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:47.950
And in those early days,
it's the right thing to do.

00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:50.580
But what we really like
to do at Mercy Corps

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:54.400
is-- the next slide-- cash.

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:57.920
We believe that there's nothing
more important than getting

00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:00.980
cash, capital, into the hands
of people who have suffered

00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:05.470
the most so that they can make
way for their own recovery,

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:08.070
so they can buy the things
that they need themselves.

00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:09.910
That's a critically
important step.

00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:10.720
Not easy to do.

00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:17.560
The use of path is critical
for three main reasons

00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:19.500
post-emergency.

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:22.592
Number one, it takes the
emphasis away from us,

00:14:22.592 --> 00:14:24.050
or whoever's doing
the distribution

00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:26.540
or the procurement, and gives
it back to the people who

00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:29.270
have suffered most so that they
are making their own decisions

00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:31.310
around their recovery.

00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:33.339
Maybe these women
here want to spend--

00:14:33.339 --> 00:14:35.130
you can see they're in
a shop there-- maybe

00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:37.030
they want to buy some
goods right there.

00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:39.250
They buy what they need
and it's up to them.

00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:41.610
Maybe they want to save that
money and spend it later.

00:14:41.610 --> 00:14:43.610
Maybe they want to give
it to a community member

00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:45.340
or maybe they want to give
it to a family member.

00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:46.490
That's entirely up to them.

00:14:46.490 --> 00:14:48.531
But the point is it puts
the power in their hands

00:14:48.531 --> 00:14:51.110
and not in our hands,
which is the point.

00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:53.055
Second, what it
does immediately is

00:14:53.055 --> 00:14:54.960
it stimulates the local economy.

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:57.050
Of course they go to
their trusted shopkeeper

00:14:57.050 --> 00:14:59.794
that they've always worked
with for years and years.

00:14:59.794 --> 00:15:01.210
And they put that
money right back

00:15:01.210 --> 00:15:03.585
into their local economy rather
than a procurement that's

00:15:03.585 --> 00:15:05.500
happening elsewhere,
and brought in,

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:07.911
and potentially
disrupting those markets.

00:15:07.911 --> 00:15:09.410
That's the last
thing we want to do.

00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:12.034
We want to stimulate markets and
make sure those things recover

00:15:12.034 --> 00:15:13.610
as quickly as possible.

00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:17.760
And third, it creates portals
for financial inclusion.

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:19.960
What I mean by that is
it creates opportunities

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:23.070
so that more kinds
of formal banking

00:15:23.070 --> 00:15:25.700
can be done with those
people after some time.

00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:27.340
Some of the mobile
banking work that we

00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:29.560
do, as a result of
that, it creates

00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:32.390
an opportunity for people to
establish savings accounts,

00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:35.330
for them to open lines of
credit so that they have,

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:40.320
post-emergency, much better
access to financial services,

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:41.530
which is really important.

00:15:41.530 --> 00:15:44.270
So the whole point here is
trying to use innovation

00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:46.470
in a way that creates
a situation that

00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:51.030
was better than it was before
the emergency happened.

00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:52.480
So how do you do it?

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:55.450
In Nepal, it was interesting,
because a few things happened.

00:15:55.450 --> 00:15:57.710
Number one, the
earthquake disrupted

00:15:57.710 --> 00:16:00.000
the microfinance system.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.350
There's a pretty well-developed
microfinance system

00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:04.700
pretty far into the mountains.

00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:06.090
That collapsed.

00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:07.670
So money was not flowing at all.

00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:09.940
The commercial banking
system also collapsed.

00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:11.710
So that wasn't
working at all either.

00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:13.910
So at Mercy Corps, we
thought, how can we do this.

00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:17.410
What can we do to make sure
that we can get capital

00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:19.672
into the hands of people
as quickly as possible?

00:16:19.672 --> 00:16:21.880
And what we did was, the
team came up with this idea,

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:25.042
let's use local shopkeepers
as the cashout point.

00:16:25.042 --> 00:16:27.000
Let's find a way to get
the cash into the hands

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.060
of the shopkeepers
people always use

00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:30.920
and have them
distribute the cash,

00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:34.210
thereby using a system
that they already trust

00:16:34.210 --> 00:16:35.377
and stimulating the economy.

00:16:35.377 --> 00:16:36.335
And that's what we did.

00:16:36.335 --> 00:16:37.790
And we basically
built on a system

00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:41.990
that we tried in the Philippines
after Haiyan-- the big storm

00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:44.760
there, the typhoon
there-- and built on that

00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:46.160
and riffed on it a little bit.

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:47.493
And we came up with this system.

00:16:47.493 --> 00:16:51.440
And as a result, we reached some
25,000 households in that way.

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:52.900
That hadn't been done before.

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:57.040
The idea of using cash to
stimulate local economies

00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:00.070
is now a really critically
important strategic point

00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:02.140
for Mercy Corps in
every emergency we do.

00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:03.930
We ask ourselves,
number one, what can

00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:07.040
we do to stimulate the markets.

00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:10.130
What can we do to make sure that
we don't disrupt the markets?

00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:11.960
And how can we get
cash into their hands?

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:14.829
And in this case,
that was the solution.

00:17:14.829 --> 00:17:16.430
Next slide.

00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:18.359
It's a little bit--
I love this picture.

00:17:18.359 --> 00:17:22.020
That guy looks pretty happy
to have those rupees in hand.

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:24.180
It's a little bit in
keeping with this ethos

00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:25.596
that we talk about
in Mercy Corps,

00:17:25.596 --> 00:17:27.119
community led, market driven.

00:17:27.119 --> 00:17:28.790
How can we do both
things at once,

00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:30.620
let the community
lead their recovery

00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:33.080
and stimulate markets,
and tie what we're doing

00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:35.394
into the marketplace as well?

00:17:35.394 --> 00:17:38.320
Next slide.

00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:42.210
So in those areas,
post-earthquake,

00:17:42.210 --> 00:17:44.200
Mercy Corps' strategy
for a long-term recovery

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:45.690
has three pieces to it.

00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:48.580
Number one, it has a disaster
risk reduction part to it.

00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:50.280
You can see from
this slope here,

00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:52.890
these communities-- you can see
how this land is sloughing off

00:17:52.890 --> 00:17:56.291
here-- these communities need
to think very hard about,

00:17:56.291 --> 00:17:58.790
where are the future shocks and
stresses going to come from,

00:17:58.790 --> 00:18:00.350
because they will come.

00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:02.857
So helping those
communities think out

00:18:02.857 --> 00:18:04.690
what's going to happen
the next time there's

00:18:04.690 --> 00:18:06.856
an earthquake, what's going
to happen when there is,

00:18:06.856 --> 00:18:09.890
potentially, a landslide, when
the rains come, and so forth,

00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:13.180
and those hillsides slough
off-- so disaster risk reduction

00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:14.190
is really important.

00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:16.055
Second, keep pushing
the frontiers

00:18:16.055 --> 00:18:17.820
on the financial inclusion.

00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:20.980
How can we make sure more
people have access to capital?

00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:24.350
In the Himalayas,
the higher you go

00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:28.440
in altitude, of course, the
higher the cost per transaction

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:30.160
means that the lesser
number of people

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:32.150
have access to
financial services.

00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:34.350
In the lowlands,
everybody has access.

00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:37.510
High in the mountains like these
places, very few people do.

00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:39.700
How can we push that
frontier and get

00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:41.720
more people connected
to financial services

00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:44.150
is what we're trying to do.

00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:46.700
Interestingly, and I
started with talking

00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:51.070
about how resilient Nepal
is, Nepal is going to be OK.

00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:55.040
It's an incredible place,
as I said, resilient people.

00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:56.364
The recovery is well in place.

00:18:56.364 --> 00:18:57.780
I'm not saying
everything is rosy.

00:18:57.780 --> 00:18:58.434
It's not.

00:18:58.434 --> 00:19:00.850
They're having serious problems
with the constitution now,

00:19:00.850 --> 00:19:02.450
and there have been
riots over fuel,

00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:04.640
and many things
are going on there.

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:07.260
But overall, Nepal
is going to be OK.

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:10.780
It's going to come
out of this one.

00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:15.424
Other parts of the
world are just not OK.

00:19:15.424 --> 00:19:17.090
And I know we've all
read these numbers,

00:19:17.090 --> 00:19:21.490
but globally, right now, over
60 million people are displaced,

00:19:21.490 --> 00:19:24.510
the biggest number of people
displaced since World War II.

00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:27.110
That's a huge number.

00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:29.420
Mercy Corps is working--
and this picture is actually

00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:31.210
taken in Zaatari camp.

00:19:31.210 --> 00:19:33.840
About 180,000 people
live in this camp.

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:36.014
It's inside Jordan, just
over the border from Syria.

00:19:38.570 --> 00:19:42.310
We're serving about 4 million
people in and around Syria.

00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:45.831
And in fact, in Zaatari camp,
we put in the big water system

00:19:45.831 --> 00:19:46.330
here.

00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:48.010
It was a huge undertaking.

00:19:48.010 --> 00:19:51.330
But that's a piece of work
that we did right there

00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:54.150
in Zaatari camp.

00:19:54.150 --> 00:19:56.280
When we think about the
pressures facing the world

00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:59.220
right now, such as Zaatari
camp, such as the refugees who

00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:02.490
are leaving Syria and that
whole part of the world,

00:20:02.490 --> 00:20:05.450
it's going to take a
huge amount of work.

00:20:05.450 --> 00:20:08.140
This is the picture that
our team took in Greece

00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:11.510
as some refugees
arrived from Turkey,

00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:14.590
crossed the Mediterranean.

00:20:14.590 --> 00:20:17.460
And we're seeing these
numbers escalate.

00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:20.810
We surpassed 700,000
this year so far.

00:20:20.810 --> 00:20:23.020
And everybody expects
that those numbers

00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:24.950
are going to go way
beyond that next year.

00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:26.900
Double, triple, who
knows what it will be?

00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:28.320
It'll be huge.

00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:30.970
Next slide.

00:20:30.970 --> 00:20:33.176
This is a picture of
our guide, [? Mugher, ?]

00:20:33.176 --> 00:20:35.300
who is there talking to
some refugees about routes,

00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:38.420
and how to get to safe places,
and how to get information

00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:41.260
Mercy Corps works-- not only do
we work in each of the places

00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:43.980
where refugees are
coming from currently,

00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:46.100
but we're also working
in Turkey, and Greece,

00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:48.250
and in the Balkans, and
in all the places where

00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:50.530
refugees are passing through.

00:20:50.530 --> 00:20:53.500
We have great people on
the ground, that's true.

00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:55.170
But the fact is that
we're never going

00:20:55.170 --> 00:20:58.880
to be able to meet this need.

00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:03.390
We have a huge need
for three basic things

00:21:03.390 --> 00:21:05.180
as we look at a
crisis as complex

00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:07.430
as the Mediterranean
refugee crisis.

00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:09.600
Number one, we have
to keep innovating.

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:12.080
For sure, we know
that if there were

00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:14.940
magic solutions to these things,
everyone would be using them.

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:16.050
There just aren't.

00:21:16.050 --> 00:21:18.380
And in the emergency
response space,

00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:20.902
there seems to be a
dearth of innovations

00:21:20.902 --> 00:21:22.110
that are happening regularly.

00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:23.860
We have to keep
pushing on this front.

00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:26.015
The use of cash, things
like that, other ways

00:21:26.015 --> 00:21:28.390
to get cash into people's
hands are critically important.

00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:32.060
So that innovation piece is
really, really important.

00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:36.115
Number two, we have to partner
with organizations like Google.

00:21:36.115 --> 00:21:37.490
This is how we're
going to find--

00:21:37.490 --> 00:21:39.781
this is how we're going to
combine things that we never

00:21:39.781 --> 00:21:41.550
thought of to find solutions.

00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:43.340
It was such a
tremendous pleasure

00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:47.340
for our team to work with
all of you from Google.

00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:49.616
Because you guys think in
ways that we don't think.

00:21:49.616 --> 00:21:51.990
And I imagine that we think
in ways that you don't think.

00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:55.530
We love the idea of combining
these things in fresh ways.

00:21:55.530 --> 00:21:58.486
If we don't find ways to
work together at scale,

00:21:58.486 --> 00:22:00.860
I think some of these things
are going to get out of hand

00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:02.360
and we won't be
able to manage them.

00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:04.810
And the last slide.

00:22:04.810 --> 00:22:06.530
From the Mercy Corps
side, I can say

00:22:06.530 --> 00:22:11.480
I'm talking to our team in
Nepal and talking to our team

00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:12.260
elsewhere too.

00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:13.950
We are really proud of
the work that we're doing.

00:22:13.950 --> 00:22:16.075
We're really proud of the
partnerships like the one

00:22:16.075 --> 00:22:17.324
we have with Google.

00:22:17.324 --> 00:22:19.240
I think we should challenge
ourselves and say,

00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:21.000
where else can we do this.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.920
What are some other huge,
complicated challenges

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:26.730
that we can take on
and solve together?

00:22:26.730 --> 00:22:32.484
I'd like to ask these guys to
come up and say a few words

00:22:32.484 --> 00:22:33.400
about your experience.

00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:35.130
So Scott and Aswan--
Aswan, if you

00:22:35.130 --> 00:22:37.390
can come up and say a few
things about your experience

00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:38.490
when you were there.

00:22:38.490 --> 00:22:41.197
And then after that, we
can have a conversation.

00:22:41.197 --> 00:22:42.030
MALE SPEAKER: Great.

00:22:42.030 --> 00:22:45.414
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:47.956 --> 00:22:49.330
MALE SPEAKER: Well
thanks, Craig.

00:22:49.330 --> 00:22:52.530
Appreciate the partnership
with Mercy Corps.

00:22:52.530 --> 00:22:56.750
And as one of the
17 Googlers going

00:22:56.750 --> 00:23:01.230
to Nepal to work with your
organization among others,

00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:03.940
feel very privileged
for the opportunity.

00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:07.400
For me, I hadn't even yet
crossed the one year mark

00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:09.280
of my tenure here at Google.

00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:11.630
But when I heard about
the earthquake in Nepal,

00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:14.440
it was very both
personally touching for me

00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:16.960
and also surreal.

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:20.290
About a year prior,
I had been in Nepal,

00:23:20.290 --> 00:23:22.070
among other places
in the Himalayas,

00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:25.120
for about seven years
working primarily

00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:29.150
on energy and rural
community development.

00:23:29.150 --> 00:23:31.030
And so when this
happened, I wondered,

00:23:31.030 --> 00:23:33.220
well, was there something
now, as a Googler,

00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:35.820
that I might be able
to do and to help with.

00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:37.580
So upon hearing about
the application,

00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:40.420
and applying, and
about a week later,

00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:44.350
finding myself on a plane
en route to Kathmandu,

00:23:44.350 --> 00:23:46.890
stepping off the
plane, it almost

00:23:46.890 --> 00:23:49.100
looked like nothing
had changed in the year

00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:51.010
that I had been away.

00:23:51.010 --> 00:23:55.810
But as soon as we ventured out
into other parts of Kathmandu,

00:23:55.810 --> 00:23:58.644
and especially
into Sindhupalchok

00:23:58.644 --> 00:24:00.880
in the more rural areas
that were affected

00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:02.930
by the earthquake,
we could very easily

00:24:02.930 --> 00:24:08.580
see that lives were changed
just within a matter of minutes.

00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:11.010
And so initially,
I thought, perhaps

00:24:11.010 --> 00:24:14.660
my work in the Himalayas, with
communities like those that

00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:18.290
were affected prior or in some
of the earthquakes, the two

00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:21.090
earthquakes, that had
happened in China years

00:24:21.090 --> 00:24:23.150
prior might come in handy.

00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:25.810
But to my surprise,
a lot of the work

00:24:25.810 --> 00:24:28.260
that I have been doing in
the past year here at Google

00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:30.590
has been working
with data providers,

00:24:30.590 --> 00:24:33.660
working with advertisers,
and together,

00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:36.980
trying to onboard their data
for shopping and advertising

00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:39.240
products that we have here.

00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:42.480
Didn't think that that
would come in handy.

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:44.634
Boy, was I surprised.

00:24:44.634 --> 00:24:47.760
So Craig was talking about
the new innovative program

00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:50.630
around cash that
they'd been running.

00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:53.280
And one of the challenges
that they had identified

00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:56.240
was, how do we
monitor and evaluate

00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:58.430
that program to see
that it's effective,

00:24:58.430 --> 00:25:00.240
with the outputs
and outcomes are.

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:03.060
And all of a sudden, things
started coming into focus.

00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:05.660
And I saw, actually,
this is like some

00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:08.880
of the challenges we run up
against with our advertisers

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:09.680
here at Google.

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:12.980
How do we onboard the data and
make a clean data pipeline?

00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:16.980
And so myself as well as
seven other colleagues

00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:20.590
began, in our first week,
understanding more about, what

00:25:20.590 --> 00:25:23.040
was the context, what was
the meat in the problem,

00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:26.070
and then trying to
come up with a solution

00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:30.230
to work with Mercy Corps in
developing a way to streamline

00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:31.810
that data pipeline.

00:25:31.810 --> 00:25:35.320
And so I never would have
expected these two worlds,

00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:39.150
my past life as well as,
now, my world here at Google,

00:25:39.150 --> 00:25:43.370
to come into play.

00:25:43.370 --> 00:25:48.190
So that's about the
beginning of what has now

00:25:48.190 --> 00:25:51.550
turned into, I think,
a bigger adventure of,

00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:54.390
what else can we
do here at Google.

00:25:54.390 --> 00:25:57.840
And I think that this was
a really amazing experience

00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:00.250
to show that there are
a lot of opportunities,

00:26:00.250 --> 00:26:03.600
especially collaborating with
very innovative organizations

00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:04.720
like Mercy Corps.

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:06.536
And I have to say
that, on the ground,

00:26:06.536 --> 00:26:08.660
it was very impressive to
see the work that they've

00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:13.370
been doing, and not only the
very incredible programmatic

00:26:13.370 --> 00:26:14.350
work that they've done.

00:26:14.350 --> 00:26:17.210
But I think, also, what
lies at the heart of this

00:26:17.210 --> 00:26:19.730
are the great people that
they have on the ground.

00:26:19.730 --> 00:26:22.240
And I think, for
each of us, it was

00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:25.920
a very impressive experience.

00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:30.630
So I wanted to say a few things
and turn the rest of the time

00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:34.176
over to Aswan to
share his experiences.

00:26:34.176 --> 00:26:35.176
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:26:35.176 --> 00:26:38.410
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:40.120
Thank you, Scott.

00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:41.330
Thank you, Craig.

00:26:41.330 --> 00:26:44.600
So similar to the experiences
that my colleagues have already

00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:48.160
shared, Nepal, I had
visited there before.

00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:53.780
And it was a country that
struck me as pristine

00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:56.430
but also very culturally rich.

00:26:56.430 --> 00:27:00.570
And so going and visiting
back and seeing, hey,

00:27:00.570 --> 00:27:02.150
there's obviously
something-- there's

00:27:02.150 --> 00:27:04.300
a fabric-- that's
been shook here,

00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:07.020
but not understanding
the extent of it

00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:09.710
as soon as I had walked off into
the airport where the hustle

00:27:09.710 --> 00:27:16.010
and bustle was, it was humbling,
and at the same time, scary.

00:27:16.010 --> 00:27:22.890
The only thing that I took away
in my first experience to Nepal

00:27:22.890 --> 00:27:23.880
was nature.

00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:26.390
In my second
experience to Nepal,

00:27:26.390 --> 00:27:31.010
which was the trip with Mercy
Corps was remarkably different.

00:27:31.010 --> 00:27:34.260
So first of all, myself
and my colleagues,

00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:37.610
there were some folks that
were focused on data pipeline

00:27:37.610 --> 00:27:40.770
and how to do better reporting,
which Scott mentioned.

00:27:40.770 --> 00:27:42.560
There was teams
focused on, how do

00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:46.350
I elevate the visibility of
what's being done with funds.

00:27:46.350 --> 00:27:49.360
There were teams that were
tutoring local startups on how

00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:52.590
to do better front end
design, which is something

00:27:52.590 --> 00:27:55.350
that innovative tech
companies can help to teach.

00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:57.850
And then there's
also organizations

00:27:57.850 --> 00:28:00.190
that were-- there were
teams that were focused on,

00:28:00.190 --> 00:28:01.540
how do we better fundraise.

00:28:04.410 --> 00:28:06.860
How do we better
use donor funds?

00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:10.190
So there was obviously a
plethora of opportunity there.

00:28:10.190 --> 00:28:12.770
And this was actually a
remarkably competitive

00:28:12.770 --> 00:28:16.275
experience to get into
this particular initiative

00:28:16.275 --> 00:28:18.210
that Google was
running, hopefully

00:28:18.210 --> 00:28:20.280
will be replicated again.

00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:24.730
Now in terms of the personal
impact to me-- and I mentioned,

00:28:24.730 --> 00:28:28.920
first time, I'd only taken away
some of the pristine wilderness

00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:31.100
and the Himalayan
tracks and visiting

00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:32.760
some of the cultural temples.

00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:37.640
I think the second trip was
remarkably different for me.

00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:41.840
One of the stories that I
remember is a colleague of mine

00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:45.610
had generated a number
of handwritten letters

00:28:45.610 --> 00:28:48.710
from the United States in order
to actually deliver to children

00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:50.500
like a pen pal system.

00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:52.800
And one of the older
girls, after reading

00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:59.550
the letters with tears
streaming down her face,

00:28:59.550 --> 00:29:02.330
approached a group of us,
and one person in particular,

00:29:02.330 --> 00:29:06.050
and said, I want to
thank you for being here.

00:29:06.050 --> 00:29:10.990
And next time, if you ever have
an earthquake in your country,

00:29:10.990 --> 00:29:13.950
I would be happy to
come out and help you.

00:29:13.950 --> 00:29:18.460
Now I want to contextualize
the backdrop of a statement

00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:22.470
like this, a girl who
has lost family members,

00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:24.850
has been displaced
from her home,

00:29:24.850 --> 00:29:28.950
and whose family is
undergoing really hard times.

00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:31.770
And what I want to
categorize there is,

00:29:31.770 --> 00:29:37.300
there is no better indicator
of the cultural fabric

00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:41.250
of a society than when the
environment around them

00:29:41.250 --> 00:29:42.300
is strained.

00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:44.760
And for me to see
something like that,

00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:47.370
and for me to actually
be able to inculcate

00:29:47.370 --> 00:29:49.110
some of the learnings
from a very, very

00:29:49.110 --> 00:29:53.410
small seven-year-old girl
was a remarkable experience.

00:29:53.410 --> 00:29:55.200
So what I would
say to everybody,

00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:58.120
the Googler on the livestream,
the people in the room,

00:29:58.120 --> 00:30:02.200
is that Google donated money.

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:04.510
And people should
obviously donate money.

00:30:04.510 --> 00:30:06.580
But you should invest your time.

00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:08.920
And the reason I don't
say that I donated

00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:12.260
my time or the Googlers
donated their time

00:30:12.260 --> 00:30:15.570
is because we actually
got far more from it

00:30:15.570 --> 00:30:17.030
than what we put in.

00:30:17.030 --> 00:30:21.310
So a donation is something
that, you set it, you forget it,

00:30:21.310 --> 00:30:22.410
you let it go.

00:30:22.410 --> 00:30:26.120
But an investment is something
that you reap abundant rewards

00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:26.840
from.

00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:30.210
And so for me, that
categorizes and epitomizes

00:30:30.210 --> 00:30:33.420
some of the experiences
that myself, my colleagues,

00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:37.320
and my Mercy Corps
working comrades

00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:40.410
experienced in our Nepal trip.

00:30:40.410 --> 00:30:44.092
So with that said, I'll hand
it back to the presenters.

00:30:44.092 --> 00:30:47.376
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:48.996 --> 00:30:51.370
CRAIG REDMOND: I think we
wanted to open up to questions.

00:30:51.370 --> 00:30:56.650
But before we do that,
we have a wee gift.

00:30:56.650 --> 00:30:58.720
So this is for the
Google disaster corps.

00:30:58.720 --> 00:30:59.429
This is a--

00:30:59.429 --> 00:31:01.220
FEMALE SPEAKER: Would
you mind [INAUDIBLE]?

00:31:04.326 --> 00:31:06.450
CRAIG REDMOND: This is a
thangka, a traditional art

00:31:06.450 --> 00:31:11.320
form, of course, that Tibetan
Buddhists use in Nepal.

00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:13.710
And so on behalf of the Mercy
Corps team, particularly

00:31:13.710 --> 00:31:15.452
the Nepal team,
and to all of you

00:31:15.452 --> 00:31:19.800
that helped us out so incredibly
here at Google, it's an honor.

00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:20.812
Thank you very much.

00:31:20.812 --> 00:31:22.020
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you guys.

00:31:22.020 --> 00:31:25.471
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:27.225 --> 00:31:29.100
CRAIG REDMOND: So if
there are any questions,

00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:30.470
you guys want to join me?

00:31:33.090 --> 00:31:34.890
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, sure.

00:31:34.890 --> 00:31:39.840
So the question
was, for the folks

00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:45.480
who are involved
in the effort, how

00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:49.140
did we engage with the
experience of being in Nepal

00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:50.760
and also engage
with the community.

00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:55.330
And also, how did the
community see our involvement?

00:31:55.330 --> 00:31:57.950
I'll answer this
question in two ways.

00:31:57.950 --> 00:32:03.680
So the first way is that our
experiences not only focused

00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:06.610
on some of the core work we
were doing with Mercy Corps,

00:32:06.610 --> 00:32:10.770
but also were involved-- we
were involved with folks who

00:32:10.770 --> 00:32:14.390
were part of startups
in the local community

00:32:14.390 --> 00:32:17.440
and that wanted and saw
Google as an opportunity

00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:20.350
for mentorship to
learn best practices.

00:32:20.350 --> 00:32:24.650
And we conducted some of these
activities on the weekends

00:32:24.650 --> 00:32:26.922
as we weren't working
part of our core group.

00:32:26.922 --> 00:32:28.630
So that was the way
in which we connected

00:32:28.630 --> 00:32:29.940
with the tech community.

00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:33.070
We helped to-- I
want to say inspire.

00:32:33.070 --> 00:32:34.250
I hope they were inspired.

00:32:34.250 --> 00:32:38.060
I was actually more so
inspired by their dedication

00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:40.407
and wanting to be there,
wanting to stay home,

00:32:40.407 --> 00:32:41.990
wanting to stay close
to their family,

00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:45.190
wanting to use
technology to rebuild.

00:32:45.190 --> 00:32:53.430
The second piece is that I think
it's very easy, when you relate

00:32:53.430 --> 00:32:55.840
to a community and you
come from a company

00:32:55.840 --> 00:33:00.100
like Google, to think about
everything in terms of numbers.

00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:03.260
And what the numbers obfuscate
is the human experience

00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:04.810
that goes behind it.

00:33:04.810 --> 00:33:10.960
And so I think that we could
have done this "project"--

00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:13.060
we could have done it displaced.

00:33:13.060 --> 00:33:15.280
We could have done
it from a conference

00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:17.100
room across the hall.

00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:23.600
But it wouldn't have had the
local sensibilities embedded

00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:24.310
in it.

00:33:24.310 --> 00:33:26.690
It wouldn't have
driven the team members

00:33:26.690 --> 00:33:28.940
to be nearly as
passionate, because it

00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:30.900
was an academic exercise.

00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:34.360
And the folks who were on the
ground and delivering this

00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:38.280
wouldn't have had the
opportunity to work with us

00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:40.830
and also feed off of
some of the energy

00:33:40.830 --> 00:33:42.470
that we were bringing from that.

00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:45.490
So I feel like that was a
bit of a cycle that we were

00:33:45.490 --> 00:33:48.492
able to create, both working
off the Mercy Corps folks

00:33:48.492 --> 00:33:49.200
and the Googlers.

00:33:50.909 --> 00:33:52.700
CRAIG REDMOND: I have
a question, actually,

00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:53.745
for you guys.

00:33:53.745 --> 00:33:57.130
What's something
that you absolutely

00:33:57.130 --> 00:33:59.230
did not expect
when you got there

00:33:59.230 --> 00:34:02.420
in terms of what an emergency
response was going to be like?

00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:05.530
MALE SPEAKER: I did not
expect that the recovery

00:34:05.530 --> 00:34:10.060
phase would have shifted to
more of the ongoing needs.

00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:12.350
Everything that I had
seen in the news, which

00:34:12.350 --> 00:34:16.050
lasted for probably the first
two weeks after the earthquake,

00:34:16.050 --> 00:34:21.210
demonstrated a lot of
very urgent basic needs.

00:34:21.210 --> 00:34:23.530
But I didn't understand
the complexity

00:34:23.530 --> 00:34:25.620
that organizations
like Mercy Corps

00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:28.659
were trying to
solve amidst working

00:34:28.659 --> 00:34:31.510
with other humanitarian
and aid organizations,

00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:35.290
working with the
governments, and, actually,

00:34:35.290 --> 00:34:38.219
the importance and
the potential role

00:34:38.219 --> 00:34:42.679
that technology can play in
really providing leverage,

00:34:42.679 --> 00:34:47.179
transparency, clarity, and
overall organization to help

00:34:47.179 --> 00:34:51.820
make sure that the programs are
as effective as they could be.

00:34:51.820 --> 00:34:53.620
MALE SPEAKER: What
I didn't expect

00:34:53.620 --> 00:34:56.595
is the focus on making
things stronger.

00:34:56.595 --> 00:34:57.970
And I think that
was actually one

00:34:57.970 --> 00:35:01.410
of the titles of this
entire presentation.

00:35:01.410 --> 00:35:03.840
So what I imagined
was that we were

00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:07.220
going to try to get everybody
back to steady state

00:35:07.220 --> 00:35:09.060
and then we're going to leave.

00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:13.060
And what I realized is
that the NGOs working there

00:35:13.060 --> 00:35:18.730
were using the-- they were both
addressing the immediate needs

00:35:18.730 --> 00:35:20.950
and capitalizing
on the opportunity

00:35:20.950 --> 00:35:23.820
to do something
transformative, change

00:35:23.820 --> 00:35:29.130
the way the economy works to
start inspiring people to pick

00:35:29.130 --> 00:35:33.620
up businesses, to get
industry kickstarted,

00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:36.970
to start the conversation
around health care.

00:35:36.970 --> 00:35:41.230
So they were using what was
an untimely, and disastrous,

00:35:41.230 --> 00:35:45.520
and very unfortunate event
as a platform for growth

00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:48.200
and for a better,
healthier society.

00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:49.950
CRAIG REDMOND: That's
a great observation.

00:35:49.950 --> 00:35:51.991
If you look at it from a
resilience perspective--

00:35:51.991 --> 00:35:54.020
we talk about a
resilience lens there--

00:35:54.020 --> 00:35:57.850
the idea is communities
able to absorb, and adapt,

00:35:57.850 --> 00:36:00.485
and transform beyond
where they were before.

00:36:00.485 --> 00:36:02.920
I think it's exactly
the right word for that.

00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:05.253
MALE SPEAKER: And I remember,
one of the common messages

00:36:05.253 --> 00:36:08.670
that we heard almost
everyone we ran into say was,

00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:12.220
go home, tell
everyone, visit Nepal.

00:36:12.220 --> 00:36:13.690
CRAIG REDMOND: Right.

00:36:13.690 --> 00:36:14.320
Exactly.

00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:15.530
That's the time to go.

00:36:15.530 --> 00:36:17.540
That's when they need it most.

00:36:17.540 --> 00:36:20.020
AUDIENCE: Were there any
insights or surprises

00:36:20.020 --> 00:36:23.960
that you had about how
technology, and the internet,

00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:26.760
and connectivity were
relevant in a place like Nepal

00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:28.150
after a disaster?

00:36:28.150 --> 00:36:32.300
Anything that you would keep
in mind thinking forward

00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:36.690
to another situation
where the assets of Google

00:36:36.690 --> 00:36:41.100
and the internet could be used?

00:36:41.100 --> 00:36:45.420
MALE SPEAKER: So I guess I'll
start off answering this one.

00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:49.000
I think that there's
been a macro trend that

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:54.500
has changed how the world
interacts with data.

00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:57.890
And what I mean by that
is that previously,

00:36:57.890 --> 00:37:01.410
everybody did as much as
they could possibly do.

00:37:01.410 --> 00:37:06.310
And it was, let me try to
do everything that I can

00:37:06.310 --> 00:37:08.290
with what little I have.

00:37:08.290 --> 00:37:13.710
Now I feel like folks are making
very informed choices about,

00:37:13.710 --> 00:37:16.770
how do I maximize
the productivity

00:37:16.770 --> 00:37:19.280
of every single
dollar that I spend

00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:23.620
similar to a way in which, I
would say, a business is run,

00:37:23.620 --> 00:37:27.420
but not with the business
objective of, let me maximize

00:37:27.420 --> 00:37:31.030
profit, but how do I
maximize human welfare.

00:37:31.030 --> 00:37:35.570
And to me, there is
no better intersection

00:37:35.570 --> 00:37:41.580
of what Google is trying to do
around creating transparency,

00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:44.960
helping data shape
choices that people make,

00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:47.680
and the type of work that
Mercy Corps and NGOs are trying

00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:50.520
to do, which is, we're
out of the ground,

00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:55.000
but we need help zooming
out and making informed

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.930
choices about how we
allocate our resources

00:37:57.930 --> 00:38:00.952
or who we try to go help first.

00:38:00.952 --> 00:38:02.660
AUDIENCE: You're
talking about innovation

00:38:02.660 --> 00:38:04.102
being important to Mercy Corps.

00:38:04.102 --> 00:38:05.560
Can you tell a
little bit about-- I

00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:10.550
know you recently had your
first head of innovation

00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:12.880
a couple years ago.

00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:15.254
Can you just tell a
little bit about why

00:38:15.254 --> 00:38:16.670
you started that,
what came of it,

00:38:16.670 --> 00:38:19.040
what's going on now that's
different from before you had

00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:23.920
actually named that and
made that a role and a group

00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:24.855
at your organization?

00:38:24.855 --> 00:38:26.385
CRAIG REDMOND: Yeah,
great question.

00:38:26.385 --> 00:38:29.720
Mercy Corps has, from
the beginning-- well,

00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:31.980
not from the beginning, but
from the '80s-- actually

00:38:31.980 --> 00:38:34.190
been talking about
social entrepreneurship

00:38:34.190 --> 00:38:36.910
as a critical part of our DNA.

00:38:36.910 --> 00:38:39.370
And I think, from
that emphasis to being

00:38:39.370 --> 00:38:42.760
entrepreneurial wherever we
are, that we parlayed that

00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:45.230
into more of a conversation
around innovation.

00:38:45.230 --> 00:38:47.960
As I said in the presentation,
one of the issues

00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:50.606
is that it feels
like, in our space,

00:38:50.606 --> 00:38:51.980
there are so many
organizations--

00:38:51.980 --> 00:38:54.620
and not to say anything
bad about anybody--

00:38:54.620 --> 00:38:58.070
but that have been doing the
same thing over and over again

00:38:58.070 --> 00:39:00.180
for a long time.

00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:03.410
And there isn't enough
push for innovation,

00:39:03.410 --> 00:39:05.350
to bring innovation
into our space

00:39:05.350 --> 00:39:07.100
to solve these big problems.

00:39:07.100 --> 00:39:08.900
So we just have felt,
as an organization,

00:39:08.900 --> 00:39:11.710
that it's critical
that we push that.

00:39:11.710 --> 00:39:13.960
Otherwise, the
same old problems,

00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:16.740
the intractable issues that
we can't break friction on,

00:39:16.740 --> 00:39:18.280
are just going to persist.

00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:22.140
So innovation is a major driver
for us and has been forever.

00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:24.750
Some years ago, we formed
a social ventures team,

00:39:24.750 --> 00:39:27.190
a social innovations
team whose job

00:39:27.190 --> 00:39:31.340
it is to be out in the field
and to identify initiatives

00:39:31.340 --> 00:39:33.969
or concepts that come up
and help the field team grab

00:39:33.969 --> 00:39:35.510
those things and
develop them further

00:39:35.510 --> 00:39:39.450
into something, whether it be a
venture, a standalone venture,

00:39:39.450 --> 00:39:43.780
or just a really cool project
that has innovation driving it.

00:39:43.780 --> 00:39:46.640
Then we brought in a
chief innovations officer

00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:48.336
to help us further that thing.

00:39:48.336 --> 00:39:49.960
And now, again, we're
asking ourselves,

00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:52.180
as an organization, what
is the role of innovation.

00:39:52.180 --> 00:39:55.660
How do we want it to be
both a cultural trait

00:39:55.660 --> 00:39:59.929
and so that we have the hardcore
skill sets to life up ventures?

00:39:59.929 --> 00:40:02.220
And so we're constantly
playing with that whole concept

00:40:02.220 --> 00:40:05.210
of innovation, a critically
important part of who

00:40:05.210 --> 00:40:07.390
we are as an organization.

00:40:07.390 --> 00:40:10.130
And we know we have a long
ways to go, as you can see.

00:40:10.130 --> 00:40:12.250
I was thinking
about that question,

00:40:12.250 --> 00:40:13.230
the use of technology.

00:40:13.230 --> 00:40:17.740
And one of the things that
just kills me is procurement.

00:40:17.740 --> 00:40:21.210
For example, in a case like
this, what you always hear is,

00:40:21.210 --> 00:40:23.730
there are these villages
in the middle of nowhere

00:40:23.730 --> 00:40:27.780
who don't have access to
the basic services and goods

00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:28.460
that they need.

00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:30.560
And yet we know
that there are goods

00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:32.100
that are not that far away.

00:40:32.100 --> 00:40:34.550
How can we connect
the dots faster?

00:40:34.550 --> 00:40:37.314
Weeks and weeks, sometimes,
in a place like this.

00:40:37.314 --> 00:40:39.355
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, to
even layer on top of that,

00:40:39.355 --> 00:40:45.580
the WHO may have 20 trucks
and UNICEF has 1,000 tarps.

00:40:45.580 --> 00:40:48.160
How do you both
coordinate the supply side

00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:52.220
and match it to the demand
side real-time, effectively,

00:40:52.220 --> 00:40:55.060
and the least amount of cost
and least amount of risk.

00:40:55.060 --> 00:40:57.686
CRAIG REDMOND: That's just a nut
that we have to crack somehow.

00:40:57.686 --> 00:40:59.435
AUDIENCE: Craig, I'd
be interested to hear

00:40:59.435 --> 00:41:01.560
you talk a little bit about
how you made decisions

00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:06.676
on how to deploy your resources
where there are a lot of places

00:41:06.676 --> 00:41:07.800
that you could possibly go.

00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:11.330
And how do you make the
decision about where to go?

00:41:11.330 --> 00:41:13.510
And how do you make
the decision about when

00:41:13.510 --> 00:41:15.090
it's time to close it down?

00:41:15.090 --> 00:41:16.780
CRAIG REDMOND: That's
a great question.

00:41:16.780 --> 00:41:19.630
As an organization,
we're very decentralized.

00:41:19.630 --> 00:41:22.974
We have a distributed model so
that we have regional teams.

00:41:22.974 --> 00:41:25.140
And our countries huddle
under those regional teams.

00:41:25.140 --> 00:41:28.070
And basically, the big
decisions around what's

00:41:28.070 --> 00:41:30.840
happening day to day are made
by those teams out there.

00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:33.100
Those things don't come
to me and my team at all.

00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:36.240
So that's that first layer
as a way that we operate.

00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:38.510
We just believe people
closest to the action

00:41:38.510 --> 00:41:40.050
have to be calling the shots.

00:41:40.050 --> 00:41:42.300
That's not to say that we
don't have central resources

00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:44.060
that we have to call upon.

00:41:44.060 --> 00:41:46.780
We have an emergency
response team

00:41:46.780 --> 00:41:49.420
that, when something happens,
we say, this one looks bad.

00:41:49.420 --> 00:41:50.250
We're tracking it.

00:41:50.250 --> 00:41:52.840
We follow the news just
like everybody does.

00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:54.660
We reach into our
networks to make

00:41:54.660 --> 00:41:56.790
sure we have all the
information we can get,

00:41:56.790 --> 00:41:58.395
as fast as possible,
about what's

00:41:58.395 --> 00:42:00.270
happening in the storm
that's about the crash

00:42:00.270 --> 00:42:02.770
into the coast of Mexico.

00:42:02.770 --> 00:42:06.140
In the hours before that,
we sent teams from Guatemala

00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:09.410
and from Colombia in there to
make sure that they were there

00:42:09.410 --> 00:42:12.110
and ready to go, just in
case that thing was horrible.

00:42:12.110 --> 00:42:14.270
Thank god, in this
case, it wasn't.

00:42:14.270 --> 00:42:16.647
But we looked at
it and thought, it

00:42:16.647 --> 00:42:18.480
looks bad enough to
where we should probably

00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:20.440
be pre-positioned there.

00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:22.000
So we have a team
that does that.

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:24.720
Otherwise, to tell
you the truth,

00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:26.221
it's more of an
art than a science.

00:42:26.221 --> 00:42:26.970
We're watching it.

00:42:26.970 --> 00:42:28.890
We're thinking, who could
we get there faster,

00:42:28.890 --> 00:42:33.940
somebody from Europe or somebody
who's sitting in Zimbabwe?

00:42:33.940 --> 00:42:36.131
And hopefully, we have
the teams and the skill

00:42:36.131 --> 00:42:38.130
sets who are ready to go
and address that thing.

00:42:38.130 --> 00:42:40.580
And we send those people
as fast as possible.

00:42:40.580 --> 00:42:42.820
So a lot of
conversations happen.

00:42:42.820 --> 00:42:45.170
Sometimes we don't have the
conversations fast enough.

00:42:45.170 --> 00:42:47.260
And we ding ourselves and
we think, OK, we should

00:42:47.260 --> 00:42:48.620
have done that another way.

00:42:48.620 --> 00:42:51.400
But it's about moving resources
and really smart, capable

00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:54.860
people around as
quickly as possible.

00:42:54.860 --> 00:42:56.860
Shutting down-- shutting
down an operation

00:42:56.860 --> 00:43:00.120
is oftentimes much
harder than starting one.

00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:02.720
Because when you start
one, it's very clear,

00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:04.585
you need to be there,
this thing happened.

00:43:04.585 --> 00:43:05.960
And it's not always
an emergency.

00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:09.560
We're not only an emergency
response organization.

00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:12.900
Shutting one down is another--
several things happen.

00:43:12.900 --> 00:43:17.360
Number one, what usually happens
when we shut one down is we

00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:22.690
feel that there are skills and
capacities locally available

00:43:22.690 --> 00:43:25.354
such that they
can do what we do.

00:43:25.354 --> 00:43:26.520
Oftentimes, that's the case.

00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:29.230
And sometimes we build those
institutions from the ground

00:43:29.230 --> 00:43:31.352
up so that they can replace us.

00:43:31.352 --> 00:43:32.810
We're not in the
long-term business

00:43:32.810 --> 00:43:35.460
of being in a country
for 25 years, though we

00:43:35.460 --> 00:43:38.144
have in some places,
like Afghanistan.

00:43:38.144 --> 00:43:39.060
That's the main thing.

00:43:39.060 --> 00:43:41.890
Oftentimes, unfortunately,
there are some places

00:43:41.890 --> 00:43:45.310
where there is no funding.

00:43:45.310 --> 00:43:46.720
Case in point would be Sudan.

00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:47.220
We're there.

00:43:47.220 --> 00:43:48.020
We're operating.

00:43:48.020 --> 00:43:49.475
We need to be there.

00:43:49.475 --> 00:43:52.220
Darfur is a horrible
situation still.

00:43:52.220 --> 00:43:53.780
We're committed to being there.

00:43:53.780 --> 00:43:55.440
And I'm telling you, it's
getting harder and harder

00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:57.820
to be there, just because
the funding situation is such

00:43:57.820 --> 00:44:00.160
that, probably, at
some point, we'll

00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:03.027
have to make tough choices, shut
down something else in order

00:44:03.027 --> 00:44:04.110
to stay operational there.

00:44:04.110 --> 00:44:05.943
So I would say those
are the kinds of things

00:44:05.943 --> 00:44:09.344
that go through our minds in
deciding what to shut down.

00:44:09.344 --> 00:44:10.760
AUDIENCE: Question
is, what advice

00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:12.900
do you have to others
considering disaster relief

00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:15.620
work or volunteering positions.

00:44:15.620 --> 00:44:17.600
And I guess I'd add
to that, specifically,

00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:19.630
for someone who has
never been to Nepal,

00:44:19.630 --> 00:44:23.194
would you recommend they go
there to do this kind of work?

00:44:23.194 --> 00:44:25.110
MALE SPEAKER: I would
say that there are a lot

00:44:25.110 --> 00:44:29.000
of opportunities in Nepal
for anyone who has been there

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:30.570
as well as people who haven't.

00:44:30.570 --> 00:44:33.160
I think that the
diversity of experience,

00:44:33.160 --> 00:44:35.630
skill sets, and perspective
that people can bring

00:44:35.630 --> 00:44:36.680
is very valuable.

00:44:39.310 --> 00:44:41.200
Especially from
within Google, we

00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:43.630
had a team that
was very diverse.

00:44:43.630 --> 00:44:47.000
I mean, Aswan, who probably
hasn't shared any of this,

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:50.330
he's a trained medical doctor
in addition to consulting,

00:44:50.330 --> 00:44:51.980
in addition to
operations and business.

00:44:51.980 --> 00:44:53.230
CRAIG REDMOND: You want a job?

00:44:53.230 --> 00:44:57.560
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, so very
esteemed and skilled colleagues

00:44:57.560 --> 00:45:01.770
as well as some of our
top engineers, operations.

00:45:01.770 --> 00:45:05.980
So we had a real dream team
that was assembled together

00:45:05.980 --> 00:45:07.690
to go to Nepal.

00:45:07.690 --> 00:45:09.790
And I think we were
all able to play

00:45:09.790 --> 00:45:13.660
very interesting and different
roles that, together, coalesced

00:45:13.660 --> 00:45:15.450
very well.

00:45:15.450 --> 00:45:17.610
MALE SPEAKER: I think
the critical success

00:45:17.610 --> 00:45:22.892
factors, really, would be,
you have a passion to help,

00:45:22.892 --> 00:45:27.510
you're open to the
idea that you may not

00:45:27.510 --> 00:45:30.610
have 100% of your
modern conveniences,

00:45:30.610 --> 00:45:36.010
and you really care
about learning.

00:45:36.010 --> 00:45:39.450
Because it's very
easy to take the view

00:45:39.450 --> 00:45:43.080
that you're coming in to do
something for somebody else,

00:45:43.080 --> 00:45:46.190
but they're shaping you.

00:45:46.190 --> 00:45:48.300
The problem is shaping
you in the solution

00:45:48.300 --> 00:45:51.220
just as much as you're helping
to influence the problem.

00:45:51.220 --> 00:45:53.657
So those are the
big three that I

00:45:53.657 --> 00:45:56.380
would look at to
evaluate whether or not

00:45:56.380 --> 00:45:57.360
you're a good fit.

00:45:57.360 --> 00:45:59.790
MALE SPEAKER: And I
think, as was alluded to,

00:45:59.790 --> 00:46:01.440
sometimes these
are not commitments

00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:04.130
that just end at
the time when you're

00:46:04.130 --> 00:46:05.610
on the plane to return back.

00:46:05.610 --> 00:46:07.830
But there's follow-up
and additional work

00:46:07.830 --> 00:46:10.320
that is something that
you can contribute

00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:13.140
to even though you've
left a place, but also

00:46:13.140 --> 00:46:15.616
very critical to seeing
that the implementation

00:46:15.616 --> 00:46:17.725
and that the solution
really goes into practice.

00:46:21.142 --> 00:46:22.600
AUDIENCE: Aswan,
I really liked how

00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:25.800
you described your experience
as not donating your time

00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:27.590
but investing it.

00:46:27.590 --> 00:46:31.580
I'd love to hear from you
and Scott, maybe something

00:46:31.580 --> 00:46:33.850
that you're doing
differently or thinking about

00:46:33.850 --> 00:46:38.630
differently now that you're
back in the Bay Area.

00:46:38.630 --> 00:46:42.280
MALE SPEAKER: I'll say that
on a recent trip to New York,

00:46:42.280 --> 00:46:46.110
I had an opportunity to meet
with some of our open source

00:46:46.110 --> 00:46:48.490
platform partners that
we were working with.

00:46:48.490 --> 00:46:52.610
And so I had a chance to both do
this work as well as the Google

00:46:52.610 --> 00:46:54.340
work on the side.

00:46:54.340 --> 00:46:57.615
And then at another
conference a couple weeks ago,

00:46:57.615 --> 00:47:00.240
I found a software
provider that was actually

00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:04.280
offering their software
for free to non-profits.

00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:06.180
And so we've seen
that, actually,

00:47:06.180 --> 00:47:10.420
the situation as we had known
it on the ground in Nepal

00:47:10.420 --> 00:47:14.350
has continued to evolve,
from increased connections

00:47:14.350 --> 00:47:17.160
that we've made after the fact
and additional information

00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:18.350
that we've learned.

00:47:18.350 --> 00:47:20.190
So seeing that,
actually, there are

00:47:20.190 --> 00:47:23.256
lots of opportunities to
remain engaged and follow up.

00:47:23.256 --> 00:47:25.920
MALE SPEAKER: So I
think, for me, there's

00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:29.490
probably two social
activities and then there's

00:47:29.490 --> 00:47:32.885
one personal behavioral change.

00:47:32.885 --> 00:47:34.970
I think the two
social activities

00:47:34.970 --> 00:47:40.230
are elevating the visibility
of this type of work

00:47:40.230 --> 00:47:42.750
for folks to recognize
that there is something

00:47:42.750 --> 00:47:48.210
that they can do even if
their job seems very, very

00:47:48.210 --> 00:47:52.270
distant from what could help.

00:47:52.270 --> 00:47:56.380
Even if you start looking at
the professional landscape,

00:47:56.380 --> 00:47:58.800
people are looking
for intersections

00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:02.670
of very different content
areas and expertise.

00:48:02.670 --> 00:48:04.600
Because a lot of
innovation actually

00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:08.190
happens at the confluence
of two of those things.

00:48:08.190 --> 00:48:10.790
So for me, elevating
visibility is one.

00:48:10.790 --> 00:48:12.480
The second piece, I
would say, is also

00:48:12.480 --> 00:48:17.760
advocacy in that,
through this experience,

00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:20.120
I feel, now more
so than ever, it's

00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:24.730
important not only to be part
of the immediate response,

00:48:24.730 --> 00:48:28.150
but then also to have that
continuity to continue

00:48:28.150 --> 00:48:30.390
to donate through recovery.

00:48:30.390 --> 00:48:33.000
And I hadn't segregated
those two things

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:36.510
as part of a disaster, but
now I very much understand.

00:48:36.510 --> 00:48:38.290
And to the point
that Craig just made,

00:48:38.290 --> 00:48:42.080
the funding is running
out, because people

00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:44.390
have started to lose interest.

00:48:44.390 --> 00:48:46.530
But the need is still there.

00:48:46.530 --> 00:48:53.390
On the personal front, I
have two young children.

00:48:53.390 --> 00:48:57.000
And I'm trying to-- I
think there's always

00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:59.490
been this push towards, OK,
they have all their needs met,

00:48:59.490 --> 00:49:02.460
so let me focus them on
academics and so on and so

00:49:02.460 --> 00:49:03.780
forth.

00:49:03.780 --> 00:49:06.270
But the shaping experiences
with the children

00:49:06.270 --> 00:49:11.590
that we met where they
put serving others

00:49:11.590 --> 00:49:13.750
above their immediate
needs, I feel

00:49:13.750 --> 00:49:17.540
like that's a mindset that
is more valuable for me

00:49:17.540 --> 00:49:21.430
to inculcate into my
children than just, OK,

00:49:21.430 --> 00:49:22.550
can you do your math.

00:49:22.550 --> 00:49:23.720
Can you do your science?

00:49:23.720 --> 00:49:26.520
Can you do your reading
and writing effectively?

00:49:26.520 --> 00:49:31.450
So I know that's more a thematic
change that I'm trying to do.

00:49:31.450 --> 00:49:34.260
But I feel like a
lot of these things

00:49:34.260 --> 00:49:36.150
actually start pretty early.

00:49:36.150 --> 00:49:37.890
And even if you haven't
done them early,

00:49:37.890 --> 00:49:40.500
there's an opportunity
for you to do them

00:49:40.500 --> 00:49:41.890
when you're older as well.

00:49:41.890 --> 00:49:47.330
So for me, it's just exposure
for my children, for my family.

00:49:47.330 --> 00:49:48.657
CRAIG REDMOND: Sure.

00:49:48.657 --> 00:49:50.990
On behalf of Mercy Corps, I
want to thank you all again.

00:49:50.990 --> 00:49:52.890
It's a wonderful
opportunity to be

00:49:52.890 --> 00:49:57.270
able to stand here
with my friends

00:49:57.270 --> 00:50:01.100
Aswan and Scott to talk about
our shared experience there.

00:50:01.100 --> 00:50:04.547
As I said at the close
of my comments here,

00:50:04.547 --> 00:50:06.630
I'm really proud of the
work that we did together.

00:50:06.630 --> 00:50:10.287
And if you scan the
globe, even just briefly,

00:50:10.287 --> 00:50:11.870
there are so many
opportunities for us

00:50:11.870 --> 00:50:13.530
to do wonderful things together.

00:50:13.530 --> 00:50:14.797
So I look forward to that.

00:50:14.797 --> 00:50:16.380
And thank you very
much for your time.

00:50:16.380 --> 00:50:21.102
[APPLAUSE]
