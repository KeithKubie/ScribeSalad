Harvard University told me about
 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.369
Harvard University told me about
algorithmic corporations and today we

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379
algorithmic corporations and today we
 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.410
algorithmic corporations and today we
can do that with cloud computing we can

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420
can do that with cloud computing we can
 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.929
can do that with cloud computing we can
have an algorithm that spins up servers

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939
have an algorithm that spins up servers
 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.420
have an algorithm that spins up servers
and then makes new resources available

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430
and then makes new resources available
 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.390
and then makes new resources available
to a system well he's talking about

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400

that generates a corporation that I've

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679
that generates a corporation that I've
 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.010
that generates a corporation that I've
algorithm will say we need a new company

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020
algorithm will say we need a new company
 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.110
algorithm will say we need a new company
and we'll spin up all the legal

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120
and we'll spin up all the legal
 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.990
and we'll spin up all the legal
documents and file them and create an

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000
documents and file them and create an
 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
documents and file them and create an
LLC why would you do that because one

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010
LLC why would you do that because one
 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.090
