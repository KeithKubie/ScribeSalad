00:00:00.301 --> 00:00:02.884
(gentle music)

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.500
- At your first pre-natal
visit during your pregnancy

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:15.940
your provider will order a number

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:17.750
of routine pre-natal labs.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.390
The term pre-natal means prior to birth

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.210
and refers to the time
period of your pregnancy.

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.440
It's helpful to know what you
will be screened for and why.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.720
These tests will require a blood sample,

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.670
urine sample, and vaginal swab sample.

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:33.530
Some testing may have already been done

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.940
before you are pregnant during
a pre-conception appointment.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.640
Your provider will check your blood type

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.470
and Rhesus type, or RH type,
which is a specific protein

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:44.500
on red blood cells that has implications

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.120
for the health of your baby.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.320
Your provider will make sure
you don't have antibodies

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.580
to other types of blood
that could potentially

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.163
put your pregnancy at risk.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.290
Your provider will get
a starting evaluation

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.450
of your blood level and platelet level.

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.550
This helps ensure that you're not anemic

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.080
or have complications that could lead

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.108
to dangerous bleeding during
your pregnancy or at delivery.

00:01:05.108 --> 00:01:07.480
You will be tested to
see if you are immune

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.910
to German measles, also known as Rubella,

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:11.810
and if you are immune to Chickenpox,

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.270
also known as Varicella.

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.590
If you are not immune to either of these,

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.470
it will be especially
important to avoid infection

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.270
during pregnancy and you can
get a vaccine after delivery

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.532
to protect you in the future.

00:01:23.532 --> 00:01:26.690
All women in the U.S.
are screened for HIV,

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.570
syphilis, hepatitis B,
chlamydia, and gonorrhea.

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.760
Some providers add tuberculosis
screening to this panel.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.130
Women with risk factors
should also be screened

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.730
for hepatitis C and Trichomonas vaginalis.

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:41.670
For patients with other risk factors,

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.420
Zika screening, toxoplasmosis screening,

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.663
or herpes screening may also be offered.

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.150
Your provider will check to see

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.740
if you're carrying any
bacteria in your urine.

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.070
You may not have any symptoms,
but if you have any bacteria,

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:56.580
you will need antibiotic treatment

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.420
to prevent a potential kidney infection

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.350
during your pregnancy.

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.600
The American College of
Obstetrics and Gynecology

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.760
recommends all women be tested

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.060
to see if they are
cystic fibrosis carriers

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.470
or spinal muscular atrophy carriers.

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:10.960
If you are found to be a carrier,

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.203
your partner should also undergo testing.

00:02:14.617 --> 00:02:17.500
Women who are at risk
of pre-existing diabetes

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.710
will be tested at the
beginning of pregnancy

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.410
and most women will then be tested

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.610
for gestational diabetes between 24

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.483
and 28 weeks of gestation.

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.930
Thyroid screening is not
recommend for all patients.

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.460
If you have any risk factors

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.450
or a history of thyroid disfunction,

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.400
your provider will recommend screening.

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:37.640
Your provider will offer you

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.310
a non-invasive fetal
genetic screening test

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.820
to determine if your pregnancy is high

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:44.580
or low risk for Down syndrome

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.310
or other genetic trisomy anomalies.

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.870
This testing is optional
and you have the choice

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.270
to meet with a genetic counselor

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.340
to find out more about it.

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.130
If you test positive, you
would then be given the option

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:57.910
for invasive testing such as with

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.700
chorionic villi sampling or amniocentesis

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.300
to diagnose if your pregnancy is positive

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:04.523
for genetic anomaly.

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.280
At 35 to 36 weeks gestation,

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.410
your provider will collect a vaginal swab

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.420
to test for Group B Streptococcus.

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.910
This type of bacteria can infect
your baby during delivery.

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.270
If you are a carrier, you
will be given antibiotics

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:20.880
during your labor.

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.710
As always, we encourage
you to ask questions

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:25.720
if you don't understand
why a particular test

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.560
is recommended by your provider.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.426
Your healthcare team is here for you

00:03:29.426 --> 00:03:33.542
working to ensure your pregnancy
is off to a healthy start.

00:03:33.542 --> 00:03:36.042
