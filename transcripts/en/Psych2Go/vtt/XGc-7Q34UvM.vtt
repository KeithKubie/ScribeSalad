00:00:01.569 --> 00:00:05.789
Asian-american writer Amy Tan had a difficult relationship with her mother, Daisy

00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:12.598
At one point Daisy held a knife to her throat and threatened to kill her when the two of them argued over Amy's new boyfriend

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:20.160
Daisy would often threaten to kill herself and attempted suicide once but failed hoping to join her mother who died committing suicide

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.189
Amy tan grew up with a neurotic toxic relationship with her mother that was life threatening and traumatizing

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:31.079
What's scary about toxic relationships is that the signs aren't always clearly visible

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:32.349
in fact

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:38.609
Some girls don't realize they have an unhealthy bond with their mothers until they are older or in some cases when it's too late

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.960
Has there always been a subtle tension between you and your mother, but you're not sure

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.930
Why do you often feel afraid of your mother? Here's six types of unhealthy mother-daughter relationships

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.000
One: Bosom Buddies

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.689
This is when the mother is more concerned about being her daughter's best friend more than playing the role of a parent

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:05.489
the mother knows every little detail about her daughter's life and although she offers great emotional support as her daughter gets older and wants to

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:11.548
Branch out and do independent activities. The mother will continue to smother her in this type of relationship

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:18.359
The daughter rarely gets disciplined by her mother and has a hard time building practical life skills because she wasn't given the proper guidance

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.600
Two: Boss and Subordinate

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.619
This is when the mother wants to control and dominate her daughter's life

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:32.549
The mother is often very demanding rigid close minded and expects the daughter to follow her rules and expectations

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.199
She typically lacks empathy and puts pressure on her daughter to perform well

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.549
The daughter often feels as though she has to be perfect to win her mother's approval

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:49.379
She also suffers from low self-esteem problems and fears being rejected or judged harshly by others as the daughter gets older

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.509
She will grow resentful of her mother and will typically rebel whether it's done loudly or quietly

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:01.409
Three: Rivals. In this relationship the mother sees her daughter as a rival or threat

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.879
Although the mother may seem as though she's supportive of her daughter on the inside

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:13.110
she feels insecure about herself when she's with her. The mother constantly compares herself to her daughter to see who is prettier, thinner

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:19.110
smarter and more successful rather than developing a relationship based on understanding and acceptance

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.889
the daughter usually feels internally conflicted and unworthy

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:26.129
Four: The Role Reversal Relationship

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:31.139
This is when the mother expects her daughter to play the role of a parent and be there to support her

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.479
This relationship is one-sided and the daughter feels abandoned, used and neglected

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:42.029
The mother is only concerned about her own needs and makes sure she's the one being nurtured by her daughter

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:43.599
At a young age

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:50.729
the daughter learned that she must sacrifice herself and put others first. As she gets older she often suffers from low self-esteem

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.839
issues and has a hard time saying no and setting healthy boundaries for herself

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:02.280
Five: The Ghost. In this relationship the mother can either be emotionally and or physically

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.579
unavailable to her daughter. If the mother is emotionally unavailable

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:12.750
She may choose to withdraw or withhold love from her daughter and give it to her other child. If the mother decides to ghost

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.809
She leaves and gives her daughter up to either her other

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.049
biological parent or another guardian who can take care of her

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:26.039
The daughter usually doesn't receive an explanation or closure for why her mother left and usually grows up with an empty void

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.699
Six: Good Mom/Bad Mom. This is an erratic relationship between the mother and daughter

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.989
The daughter never knows whether the bad mom or good mom will show up

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:40.949
She often faces hot and cold treatment from her and fears her mom

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.329
The mother usually acts good when they are out in public and there are others around them

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:49.649
She displays kind behavior, smiles and pretends to care for her daughter

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:54.809
But when it's just the two of them the mother will show her true colors and acts dismissive

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.660
neglectful and cold. In this relationship

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:02.700
the mother only wants to put up a good image when she has to and fails to connect with her daughter

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.709
Which type of unhealthy mother-daughter relationship do you resonate with?

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:14.009
We know how hard it is to talk about toxic family dynamics and want to be a safe non-judgmental place for you
