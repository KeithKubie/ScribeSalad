00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:25.930 align:start position:0%

maybe<00:10:26.110><c> more</c><00:10:26.379><c> of</c><00:10:26.500><c> a</c><00:10:26.589><c> mock</c><00:10:26.800><c> Oh</c><00:10:26.980><c> character</c><00:10:27.490><c> design</c>

00:10:27.889 --> 00:10:27.899 align:start position:0%
maybe more of a mock Oh character design
 

00:10:27.899 --> 00:10:30.119 align:start position:0%
maybe more of a mock Oh character design
you<00:10:28.899><c> know</c><00:10:28.990><c> didn't</c><00:10:29.290><c> have</c><00:10:29.379><c> to</c><00:10:29.470><c> be</c><00:10:29.559><c> a</c><00:10:29.589><c> carbon</c><00:10:29.949><c> copy</c>

00:10:30.119 --> 00:10:30.129 align:start position:0%
you know didn't have to be a carbon copy
 

00:10:30.129 --> 00:10:33.420 align:start position:0%
you know didn't have to be a carbon copy
of<00:10:30.279><c> Zuko</c><00:10:30.730><c> but</c><00:10:31.589><c> yeah</c><00:10:32.589><c> there's</c><00:10:32.920><c> just</c><00:10:32.980><c> something</c>

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:33.430 align:start position:0%

00:10:35.249 --> 00:10:35.259 align:start position:0%
about it that it just doesn't click with
 

00:10:35.259 --> 00:10:39.059 align:start position:0%
about it that it just doesn't click with

00:10:39.059 --> 00:10:39.069 align:start position:0%
me you know and I I know it's a tire but
 

00:10:39.069 --> 00:10:40.350 align:start position:0%
me you know and I I know it's a tire but
I<00:10:39.129><c> mean</c><00:10:39.309><c> there's</c><00:10:39.459><c> one</c><00:10:39.639><c> two</c><00:10:39.819><c> angles</c><00:10:40.120><c> like</c><00:10:40.209><c> we</c>

00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:40.360 align:start position:0%
I mean there's one two angles like we
 

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:42.329 align:start position:0%
I mean there's one two angles like we
has<00:10:40.569><c> head</c><00:10:40.809><c> down</c><00:10:41.050><c> he</c><00:10:41.290><c> looked</c><00:10:41.559><c> a</c><00:10:41.680><c> little</c><00:10:42.069><c> younger</c>

00:10:42.329 --> 00:10:42.339 align:start position:0%
has head down he looked a little younger
 

00:10:42.339 --> 00:10:44.309 align:start position:0%
has head down he looked a little younger
it's<00:10:42.639><c> ER</c><00:10:42.790><c> like</c><00:10:43.029><c> all</c><00:10:43.180><c> the</c><00:10:43.300><c> bearing</c><00:10:43.600><c> is</c><00:10:43.720><c> it</c><00:10:43.870><c> okay</c>

there's<00:10:44.589><c> a</c><00:10:44.649><c> great</c><00:10:45.370><c> example</c><00:10:45.970><c> where</c><00:10:46.269><c> he</c><00:10:46.600><c> looks</c>

00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:46.870 align:start position:0%
there's a great example where he looks
 

00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:49.829 align:start position:0%
