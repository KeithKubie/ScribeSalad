00:00:01.369 --> 00:00:05.479
 For your knowledge that it is funny what is related to contemporary neuroscience 

00:00:05.479 --> 00:00:11.390
 Competent to recognize that it is considered a closed philosophy. It's really 

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:18.390
 They often make fundamental philosophical assumptions. I mean they take 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:25.270
 Certain philosophical ideas as Muslim are often used as empirical information 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:32.180
 Simply to revive old debates. For example, one of the basic shapes of images 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:38.460
 Which I think comes to people's minds about the neuroscience that is relevant to the realization that the world 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.670
 It is within our heads of reason that makes the world that what we are experiencing here is not me 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:49.010
 I face you. I can not see you. I am testing something in my mind 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:55.969
 On the form of a style of stimulation. Let me turn to the nature of colors as an example 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:00.020
 To try to clarify what is in my mind and the idea of ​​this wonderful area where 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:05.729
 Both science and philosophy decided to cooperate with each other and engage in dialogue 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.990
 With each other and in many cases was a senior philosopher and also a senior scientist 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:16.389
 Think about it. The point of view is that color, is a property of the surfaces of objects 

00:01:16.389 --> 00:01:22.069
 , Is not the property that we naively believe we see but perhaps something like portability 

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:26.649
 Absorption and reversing light have certain wavelengths and produce a type of so-called b 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:33.649
 Spectral reflection, but the color is on the surface. 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:41.039
 Another point of view is that it is illusory to believe that color is something that exists in matter, that color is just an effect 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:46.029
 Like the effect of the same thing on us. From that point the color happens to us. tree leaves 

00:01:46.029 --> 00:01:50.590
 Not green. Greenness is just an event. For me it is a kind of sensation 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:57.399
 Which is produced by the interaction of my nervous system with those leaves 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:04.169
 My personal view is that both theories are wrong. I support the theory that color is 

00:02:04.169 --> 00:02:11.169
 What you can call an environmental property means that color is a property produced by a method 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:22.480
 Light interaction with surfaces. That is not meant to be a surface 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:30.049
 The actual sheet is green. Its greenness is how it behaves with regard to light 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:40.890
 So we think the light has one pattern, but of course it looks in a certain way under a certain light 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.079
 If you take it out it will look different and if you convert it in certain ways it will be there 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:52.079
 Shiny patches and a bright, bright spot on the surfaces of things 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:03:00.499
 Which in sum are part of the true color of the thing. For me colors like shapes. Such as that of a three-dimensional shape 

00:03:00.499 --> 00:03:07.120
 It has a hidden back side so the colors will appear in hidden ways if circumstances are present 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.069
 Lighting changed. The problem of skepticism concerning the world 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:17.079
 The outer, how we know things are what they really look like, how we come to know that 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:23.469
 The argument that reliable sensory experiments are just teaser. Is a frequent philosophical teaser 

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:29.060
 I can not give it to you right now, nor can neuroscience solve it, but what I would like to do 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.590
 I convinced you that neuroscience took a solution or at least 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.700
 A position towards this repeated humor as a recognized thing and most neuroscientists who work 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:44.120
 On the side of consciousness they assumed that experience is something that happens inside me. Something subjective. Something invisible. 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.780
 The world we know is not beyond surfaces 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:55.780
 Our tent. Beyond our direct knowledge because all we know at any time is the way it is 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:59.989
 Our nervous system is stimulated by stimulation, which causes stimulation to always make us behind
