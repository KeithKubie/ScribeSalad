attention gets hijacked there is so much

attention gets hijacked there is so much
 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.880
attention gets hijacked there is so much
happening in our lives that we pay

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890
happening in our lives that we pay
 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.280
happening in our lives that we pay
attention to and and quite frankly you

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290
attention to and and quite frankly you
 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:11.540
attention to and and quite frankly you
know the little devices that we carry

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550
know the little devices that we carry
 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.580
know the little devices that we carry
around don't help very much because our

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590
around don't help very much because our
 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.700
around don't help very much because our
attention gets totally absorbed into

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710
attention gets totally absorbed into
 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.370
attention gets totally absorbed into
that attraction from these little

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380
that attraction from these little
 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:20.810
that attraction from these little
devices and we get a little bit of

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820
devices and we get a little bit of
 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.970
devices and we get a little bit of
dopamine all the time when we get all

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980
dopamine all the time when we get all
 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.150

information information is valuable

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:25.160
information information is valuable
 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.250
information information is valuable
instinctively so we want to know what's

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260
instinctively so we want to know what's
 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.650
instinctively so we want to know what's
happening and what's going on it's true

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660
happening and what's going on it's true
 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.810
happening and what's going on it's true
for gossip and that's true for why we

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820
for gossip and that's true for why we
 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.569
for gossip and that's true for why we
watch the news but the problem is that

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579
watch the news but the problem is that
 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.639
watch the news but the problem is that
our attention is so much absorbed in

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649
our attention is so much absorbed in
 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.250
our attention is so much absorbed in
that that we rarely if ever pay

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260
that that we rarely if ever pay
 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.450
that that we rarely if ever pay
attention to just being present and that

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460
attention to just being present and that
 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.830
attention to just being present and that
is really what mindfulness and

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840
is really what mindfulness and
 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.139
is really what mindfulness and
meditation is trying to balance out a

meditation is trying to balance out a
 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.049
meditation is trying to balance out a
little bit so that when the mind quiets

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059
little bit so that when the mind quiets

and you actually are at home in your
body that that that distraction fades

body that that that distraction fades
 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.189
body that that that distraction fades
away and you actually get in touch with

away and you actually get in touch with
 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.619
away and you actually get in touch with
that underlying happiness that the

with it would be really valuable to

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510
with it would be really valuable to
 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.800
with it would be really valuable to
become aware of attention and how it

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810
become aware of attention and how it
 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.149
become aware of attention and how it
automatically shifts from one to the

automatically shifts from one to the
 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.710

speed when if suddenly there would be a
 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.050
speed when if suddenly there would be a
huge loud noise we would all try one

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060
huge loud noise we would all try one
 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.910
huge loud noise we would all try one
what is it and on our attention is

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920
what is it and on our attention is
 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.730
what is it and on our attention is
immediately hijacked an attention at its

immediately hijacked an attention at its
 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.130
immediately hijacked an attention at its
core was also a very important

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140
core was also a very important
 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.940
core was also a very important
evolutionary adaptation because what

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950
evolutionary adaptation because what
 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.940
evolutionary adaptation because what
happens with attention is it either goes

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950
happens with attention is it either goes
 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.240
happens with attention is it either goes
to the highest opportunity or goes to a

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250
to the highest opportunity or goes to a
 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.340
to the highest opportunity or goes to a
highest threat that we perceive in our

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350
highest threat that we perceive in our
 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.859
highest threat that we perceive in our
environment so suddenly there is

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869
environment so suddenly there is
 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.390
environment so suddenly there is
something that we you know an

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400
something that we you know an
 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.280
something that we you know an
hunter-gather time something that was

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290
hunter-gather time something that was
 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.740
hunter-gather time something that was
available to eat and then that's where

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750
available to eat and then that's where
 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.660
available to eat and then that's where
our attention goes or there is something

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670
our attention goes or there is something
 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.730
our attention goes or there is something
like a dark shadow moving and then

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740
like a dark shadow moving and then
 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.580
like a dark shadow moving and then
that's where our attention goes and it's

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590
that's where our attention goes and it's
 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.100
that's where our attention goes and it's
automatic and the reason that we have

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110
automatic and the reason that we have
 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.270
automatic and the reason that we have
attention is to pay attention and then

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280
attention is to pay attention and then
 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.639
attention is to pay attention and then
summon all of our resources to either

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649
summon all of our resources to either
 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.310
summon all of our resources to either
take advantage of the opportunity or to

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320
take advantage of the opportunity or to
 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.469
take advantage of the opportunity or to
avoid the threat that's really the

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479
avoid the threat that's really the
 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.550
avoid the threat that's really the
purpose of attention so we sewn out

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560
purpose of attention so we sewn out
 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.589
purpose of attention so we sewn out
everything else we kind of blank

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599
everything else we kind of blank
 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.710
everything else we kind of blank
everything and just

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720
everything and just
 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.420
everything and just
focus on one thing that in that

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430
focus on one thing that in that
 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.530
focus on one thing that in that
particular moment is of highest value or

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540
particular moment is of highest value or
 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.390
particular moment is of highest value or
potentially the highest threat so

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400
potentially the highest threat so
 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.540
potentially the highest threat so
attention is a wonderful capacity you

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550
attention is a wonderful capacity you
 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.270
attention is a wonderful capacity you
know for instance little infants they

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280
know for instance little infants they
 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.220
know for instance little infants they
don't have attention they go all over

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230
don't have attention they go all over
 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.500
don't have attention they go all over
the place they look all over the place

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510
the place they look all over the place
 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.280
the place they look all over the place
and the brain eventually develops to pay

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290
and the brain eventually develops to pay
 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.050
and the brain eventually develops to pay
attention to things that again our

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060
attention to things that again our
 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.320
attention to things that again our
opportunity or a threat now we live in

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330
opportunity or a threat now we live in
 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:41.970
opportunity or a threat now we live in
such a complex environment that our

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980
such a complex environment that our
 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.400
such a complex environment that our
attention is hijacked all the time but

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410
attention is hijacked all the time but
 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.890
attention is hijacked all the time but
the antidote is not necessarily only

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900
the antidote is not necessarily only
 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.290
the antidote is not necessarily only
mindfulness you can get actually

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300
mindfulness you can get actually
 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.660
mindfulness you can get actually
obsessed with mindfulness and am i

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670
obsessed with mindfulness and am i
 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.100

paying attention so you're trying to pay

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110
paying attention so you're trying to pay
 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.140
paying attention so you're trying to pay
attention to paying attention and then

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150
attention to paying attention and then
 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.690
attention to paying attention and then
you're back to square one so I think

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700
you're back to square one so I think
 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.260
you're back to square one so I think
that to understand the value of

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.270
that to understand the value of
 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.290
that to understand the value of
attention is number one and then to

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300
attention is number one and then to
 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.090
attention is number one and then to
recognize there are times where it's

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100
recognize there are times where it's
 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.280
recognize there are times where it's
perfectly okay when a car comes rushing

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290
perfectly okay when a car comes rushing
 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:09.720
perfectly okay when a car comes rushing
at you that's where you want your

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730
at you that's where you want your
 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.390
at you that's where you want your
attention you know or when you're really

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400
attention you know or when you're really
 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.670
attention you know or when you're really
giving a public speech that's where you

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680
giving a public speech that's where you
 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.940
giving a public speech that's where you
want your attention it's not always

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950
want your attention it's not always

right to say I'm mindful and mindful and
 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.199
right to say I'm mindful and mindful and

mindful you know the brain works over

mindful you know the brain works over
time to monitor whether you're mindful

time to monitor whether you're mindful
 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.259
time to monitor whether you're mindful
or not and the way that that I think is

or not and the way that that I think is
 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:31.949
or not and the way that that I think is
the perfect way out of it is to pay

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959
the perfect way out of it is to pay
 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:34.680
the perfect way out of it is to pay
attention to your body sensation because

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690
attention to your body sensation because
 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.229
attention to your body sensation because
your body sensations will always signal

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239
your body sensations will always signal
 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:39.090
your body sensations will always signal
if there is something that's a potential

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100
if there is something that's a potential
 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.840
if there is something that's a potential
threat or a potential benefit and to

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850
threat or a potential benefit and to
 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.570
threat or a potential benefit and to
just pay attention to the body

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:45.580
just pay attention to the body
 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.990
just pay attention to the body
sensations it relaxes it but you know by

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000
sensations it relaxes it but you know by
 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.900
sensations it relaxes it but you know by
all means for a few hours so you don't
