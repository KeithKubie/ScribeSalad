00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.440
We're asked to use the drop-down
to form a linear equation

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.870
with infinitely many solutions.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.940
So an equation with
infinitely many solutions

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.120
essentially has the same
thing on both sides,

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.350
no matter what x you pick.

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.789
So first, my brain just wants
to simplify this left-hand side

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:18.330
a little bit and
then think about how

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:19.804
I can engineer the
right-hand side

00:00:19.804 --> 00:00:21.470
so it's going to be
the same as the left

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.420
no matter what x I pick.

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:24.950
So right over here,
if I distribute

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:29.520
the 4 over x minus
2, I get 4x minus 8.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.820
And then I'm adding x to that.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.360
And that's, of course, going
to be equal to 5x plus blank.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.340
And I get to pick
what my blank is.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.940
And so 4x plus x is 5x.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.240
And of course, we
still have our minus 8.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:51.150
And that's going to be
equal to 5x plus blank.

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:52.840
So what could we make
that blank so this

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.770
is true for any x we pick?

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.430
Well, over here we have
5 times an x minus 8.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.109
Well, if we make this a minus
8, or if we subtract 8 here,

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:04.650
or if we make this
a negative 8, this

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.710
is going to be true for any x.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.970
So if we make this
a negative 8, this

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.750
is going to be true
for any x you pick.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.770
You give me any x, you multiply
it by 5 and subtract 8,

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.790
that's, of course, going to
be that same x multiplied by 5

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.210
and subtracting 8.

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.460
And if you were to try to
somehow solve this equation,

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.660
subtract 5x from both sides,
you would get negative 8

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.960
is equal to negative 8, which is
absolutely true for absolutely

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.650
any x that you pick.

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.410
So let's go-- let me actually
fill this in on the exercise.

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:38.090
So I want to make 5-- it's
going to be 5x plus negative 8.
