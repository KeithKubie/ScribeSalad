00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.040
In this video, I want
to clarify two ideas

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:04.940
that we talk about
on a regular basis,

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:08.200
but are really muddled up
in our popular language.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:13.380
And these are the ideas
of mass and weight.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.890
And first, I'll tell
you what they are.

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:18.860
And then, we'll talk about
how they are muddled up.

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.170
So mass is literally-- there's
a couple of ways to view mass.

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.050
One way to view mass
is-- and this is not

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:25.883
a technical definition,
but it will give you

00:00:25.883 --> 00:00:29.550
a sense of it-- is how
much the stuff there is.

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.509
So this is similar
to saying matter.

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:37.560
So if I have more
molecules of a given mass,

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.120
I will have a
total of more mass.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.560
Or if I have more atoms,
I will have more mass.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.005
So how much stuff
there is of something.

00:00:45.005 --> 00:00:47.130
And I want to be careful
with this definition right

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.096
here, because there are
other things that aren't what

00:00:50.096 --> 00:00:51.970
we would traditionally
associate with matter,

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.360
once we start going into
more fancy physics, that

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.310
still will exhibit mass.

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:02.200
So another way to define
mass is, how does something

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.129
react to a specific force?

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:06.410
And we already learned
from Newton's second law

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.800
that if you have a given
force and you have more mass,

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.180
you'll accelerate less.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.540
If you have less mass,
you'll accelerate more.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:24.050
So how something responds
to a given force.

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.630
Something with lower
mass will accelerate more

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:27.380
for a given force.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.820
Something with higher
mass will accelerate less.

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.930
Now weight is the force
of gravity on a mass,

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:37.890
or on an object.

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:48.860
So this is the force of
gravity on an object.

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.810
And just to think about
the difference here,

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:56.380
let's think about, I guess,
myself sitting on Earth.

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.700
So if I'm on Earth, my
mass is 70 kilograms.

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.730
My mass-- let me do
this in a new color--

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:07.400
so my mass is 70 kilograms.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:12.140
There's 70 kilograms of
stuff that constitute Sal.

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.810
But my weight is
not 70 kilograms.

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.147
I mean, you'll often hear people
say, I weighs 70 kilograms.

00:02:18.147 --> 00:02:20.230
And that's all right in
just conversational usage,

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.140
but that is not
technically correct.

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.270
Because weight is the force
that Earth is pulling down--

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.750
or I should say-- the force
of gravity on my mass.

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:35.240
And so my weight-- let me think
about the weight for a second--

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:41.800
the weight is going to be equal
to the gravitational field

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.110
at Earth.

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.270
Hopefully you've watched
the video on gravity.

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.200
Or if you haven't,
feel free to watch it.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.690
But the gravitational
attraction between two objects,

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.500
so the force of gravity
between two objects

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.750
is going to big G, the universal
gravitational constant,

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.610
times the mass of
the first object--

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:14.270
let me actually-- times the mass
of the second object, divided

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:19.540
by the distance that separates
the two objects squared.

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.670
And if you're on the Earth, and
if you take all of this stuff

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.930
right over here combined-- so
if you say that this right here

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.210
is the mass of Earth.

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.800
If you say this, right
here, is the distance

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.840
from the center to
the surface of Earth,

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.240
because that's where
I'm sitting right now.

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:47.890
So distance from center
to surface of Earth.

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.840
Then all of this stuff over here
simplifies to what's sometimes

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.200
called as lower case g.

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.410
And lower case g
is-- and I'm just

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:02.550
rounding it here-- 9.8
meters per second squared.

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:04.600
So the force of
gravity for something

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.110
near the surface of
the Earth is going

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:14.640
to be this quantity right
over here times the mass.

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.519
So my weight on the
surface of the Earth

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:25.190
is this 9.8 meters
per second squared

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.100
times my mass,
times 70 kilograms.

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.460
And so this is going
to be-- I won't do,

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:37.960
well, I could get
my calculator out.

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.340
Why don't I just get my
calculator out and do the math?

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.860
I was going to round it to
10 and say it's about 700,

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.480
but let's just
actually calculate it.

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:50.500
So we have 9.8
times 70 kilograms.

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.470
So we have 686.

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:55.520
So this gives me 686.

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.655
And then the units are kilogram
meters per second squared.

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:04.760
And these units, kilogram
meters per second squared,

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:08.040
are the same thing as a newton.

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.750
So my weight-- and
you'll never hear

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.360
people say this-- but my weight
on the surface of the Earth

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.810
is 686 newtons.

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.610
And notice, I just
said that is my weight

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:24.100
on the surface of the Earth.

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:25.630
Because as you could
imagine, weight

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:29.370
is the force due to gravity
on an object, on a mass.

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:34.110
So if I go someplace else, if
I go to the moon, for example,

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:35.670
my weight will change.

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:37.280
But my mass will not.

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:38.150
So let's write this.

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:41.820
This is the weight on Earth.

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:50.850
If I were to take my
weight on the moon-- and I

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:52.620
haven't looked this
up before the video.

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:55.140
And you can verify this
for me if you like.

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:59.000
But I've been told that
the gravitational force

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.210
on the moon, or the
gravitational attraction

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:04.160
at the surface of the
moon, is about 1/6 that

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.240
of the surface of the Earth.

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:12.050
So my weight on the
moon will be roughly 1/6

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:13.930
of my weight on the Earth.

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:16.180
Times 686 newtons.

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:18.280
So that gives me a
little bit over-- what

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:21.610
is that-- 114 maybe?

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:23.440
I'll just get the
calculator out.

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:25.770
My brain operates
a little bit slower

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:27.850
while I'm recording videos.

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:28.350
Yeah.

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:28.975
I got it right.

00:06:28.975 --> 00:06:29.700
114.

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:34.762
So that gets us 114,
approximately 114 newtons.

00:06:34.762 --> 00:06:36.970
So this is the thing I really
want to emphasize then.

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:40.390
Weight is a force due
to gravity on an object.

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:44.780
Your weight changes from
planet to planet you go on.

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:47.840
Your weight would
actually even change

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:50.130
if you went to a
very high altitude

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:52.730
because you're getting
slightly further--

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:55.070
it would be immeasurably
small-- but you're

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:58.730
getting slightly further
from the center of the Earth.

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:01.330
Your weight would change
an imperceptible amount.

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:08.050
In fact, because the Earth
is not a perfect sphere--

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:11.160
it's often referred to
as an oblique spheroid--

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:16.189
your weight is actually slightly
different on different parts

00:07:16.189 --> 00:07:16.730
of the Earth.

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:19.120
If you went to the poles
verses the equator,

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:23.910
you would have a slightly
different weight.

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:25.584
Your mass does not change.

00:07:25.584 --> 00:07:27.250
It doesn't matter
where you go, assuming

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:30.000
that you don't have some type
of nuclear reaction going

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.110
on inside of you.

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:33.580
Your mass does not change.

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:42.340
So your mass does not change
depending on where you are.

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:43.960
Now, you might be
saying, hey, look,

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:46.530
I don't deal with kilograms,
and newtons, and all of this.

00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:48.310
I operate in America.

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:50.660
And in America, we
talk about pounds.

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:52.230
Is pounds appropriate?

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:55.500
And yes, pounds is
a unit of weight.

00:07:55.500 --> 00:08:06.510
So if I say that I weigh 160
pounds, this is indeed weight.

00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:13.110
I'm saying that the force of
gravity on me is 160 pounds.

00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:15.130
But then you might say,
well, what is mass then

00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:18.120
if you're talking about
the English system

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:20.410
or sometimes called
the imperial system?

00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:22.467
And here, I will
introduce you to a concept

00:08:22.467 --> 00:08:23.550
that very few people know.

00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:25.790
It's kind of a good
trivial concept.

00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:28.990
The unit of mass--
so let's just be

00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:33.710
clear here-- the unit of mass
in the imperial system, mass

00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:34.879
is called the slug.

00:08:40.055 --> 00:08:41.679
So if you wanted to
figure out how many

00:08:41.679 --> 00:08:45.420
slugs you are, so your weight--
the force of gravity on you

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:46.410
is 160 pounds.

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:52.820
This is going to be
equal to-- if you

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:56.450
were to calculate all of this
stuff-- the force of gravity

00:08:56.450 --> 00:08:57.450
on the surface of Earth.

00:08:57.450 --> 00:09:00.960
But if you were to do
it in imperial units,

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:07.990
instead of getting 9.8
meters per second squared,

00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:12.010
you would get 32 feet
per second squared, which

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:15.290
is also the acceleration
near the surface of the Earth

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:17.530
due to gravity in
feet and seconds,

00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:19.370
as opposed to
meters and seconds.

00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:24.790
And then, this is times
your mass in slugs.

00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:29.560
So to figure it out,
you divide both sides

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:32.220
by 32 feet per second squared.

00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:33.480
So let's do that.

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:38.065
Let's divide both sides by
32 feet per second squared.

00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:44.460
It cancels out.

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:46.990
And then let me get
my calculator out.

00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:53.390
So I have 160 pounds divided
by 32 feet per second squared.

00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:54.774
And I get exactly 5.

00:09:54.774 --> 00:09:56.690
I should have been able
to do that in my head.

00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:57.632
So I get 5.

00:09:57.632 --> 00:09:59.840
And the units here-- in the
numerator, I have pounds.

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:04.980
And then I'm dividing by
feet per second squared.

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:07.110
That's the same
thing as multiplying

00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:10.570
by second squared per feet.

00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:15.420
And these units, 5 pounds
second squareds over feet, this

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:18.160
is the same thing as a slug.

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:22.320
So if I weigh 160
pounds, my mass

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:28.210
is going to be equal to 5 slugs.

00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:37.520
If my mass is 70 kilograms,
my weight is 686 newtons.

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:40.780
So hopefully that clarifies
things a little bit.
