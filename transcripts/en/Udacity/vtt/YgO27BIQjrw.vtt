00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.710
You've just finished your training as a Genetic

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:06.060
Counselor. Congratulations! And a new couple has come into

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.910
your office, interested in knowing the genetic risk

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.740
for their child, for a disease that runs in

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.790
both of their families. A pretty rare disease,

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.510
called von Willebrand's disease. Surprisingly, there's a member on

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:22.391
each side of the family that has Type3.

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.560
Which is characterized by a loss of the von

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.730
Willebrand factor. Which results in blood clot

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.369
defects much like those in hemophilia. Because

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.700
of your solid genetics trainings, you know

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.770
that the genetic allele that causes Type3

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.300
von Willebrand's disease is characterized by an

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.880
autosomal recessive allele. Here's the pedigree of

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.144
the couples' families. The male has a

00:00:47.144 --> 00:00:50.640
father that's affected by Type3 von Willebrand's.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.950
And the mother has a maternal grandmother that's affected.

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.290
Now based on the information from the following pedigree

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.388
and what you know about the genetics of Type3

00:01:00.388 --> 00:01:04.050
von Willebrand's disease and the inheritance pattern. What would

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.480
you report to the parents, to the couple that's

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.920
interested in having a child? As the probability they

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.650
would have an affected child. I want you to

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.130
enter your response as a fraction in this box here,

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.080
a fraction where you have one number with a slash, a

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.790
forward slash over another number. I'm not going to give possible answers on

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.420
this, so it's going to make it a little difficult. See how you

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.390
do and see what it's like to be a real Genetic Counselor.
