00:00:06.608 --> 00:00:08.670
Water is the liquid of life.

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:09.392
We drink it,

00:00:09.392 --> 00:00:10.245
we bathe in it,

00:00:10.245 --> 00:00:10.864
we farm,

00:00:10.864 --> 00:00:11.196
cook,

00:00:11.196 --> 00:00:12.305
and clean with it.

00:00:12.305 --> 00:00:14.747
It's the most abundant molecule in our bodies.

00:00:14.747 --> 00:00:16.531
In fact, every life form we know of

00:00:16.531 --> 00:00:18.281
would die without it.

00:00:18.281 --> 00:00:20.377
But most importantly, without water,

00:00:20.377 --> 00:00:22.480
we wouldn't have

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:23.426
iced tea.

00:00:23.426 --> 00:00:26.073
Mmmm, iced tea.

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:29.871
Why do these ice cubes float?

00:00:29.871 --> 00:00:31.920
If these were cubes of solid argon

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.824
in a cup of liquid argon,

00:00:33.824 --> 00:00:34.985
they would sink.

00:00:34.985 --> 00:00:37.637
And the same goes for most other substances.

00:00:37.637 --> 00:00:40.484
But solid water, a.k.a. ice,

00:00:40.484 --> 00:00:43.394
is somehow less dense than liquid water.

00:00:43.394 --> 00:00:45.222
How's that possible?

00:00:45.222 --> 00:00:46.927
You already know that every water molecule

00:00:46.927 --> 00:00:48.970
is made up of two hydrogen atoms

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.314
bonded to one oxygen atom.

00:00:51.314 --> 00:00:52.682
Let's look at a few of the molecules

00:00:52.682 --> 00:00:54.173
in a drop of water,

00:00:54.173 --> 00:00:57.774
and let's say the temperature is 25 degrees Celcius.

00:00:57.774 --> 00:00:59.371
The molecules are bending,

00:00:59.371 --> 00:01:00.075
stretching,

00:01:00.075 --> 00:01:00.699
spinning,

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:02.536
and moving through space.

00:01:02.536 --> 00:01:04.742
Now, let's lower the temperature,

00:01:04.742 --> 00:01:06.614
which will reduce the amount of kinetic energy

00:01:06.614 --> 00:01:08.782
each of these molecules has

00:01:08.782 --> 00:01:11.665
so they'll bend, stretch, spin, and move less.

00:01:11.665 --> 00:01:13.300
And that means that on average,

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.461
they'll take up less space.

00:01:15.461 --> 00:01:17.092
Now, you'd think that as the liquid water

00:01:17.092 --> 00:01:18.533
starts to freeze,

00:01:18.533 --> 00:01:20.143
the molecules would just pack together

00:01:20.143 --> 00:01:21.732
more and more closely,

00:01:21.732 --> 00:01:23.743
but that's not what happens.

00:01:23.743 --> 00:01:25.087
Water has a special kind

00:01:25.087 --> 00:01:26.605
of interaction between molecules

00:01:26.605 --> 00:01:29.099
that most other substances don't have,

00:01:29.099 --> 00:01:30.983
and it's called a hydrogen bond.

00:01:30.983 --> 00:01:32.934
Now, remember that in a covalent bond

00:01:32.934 --> 00:01:35.187
two electrons are shared,

00:01:35.187 --> 00:01:36.399
usually unequally,

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:37.609
between atoms.

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:38.776
In a hydrogen bond,

00:01:38.776 --> 00:01:41.774
a hydrogen atom is shared, also unequally,

00:01:41.774 --> 00:01:43.390
between atoms.

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.124
One hydrogen bond looks like this.

00:01:46.124 --> 00:01:47.878
Two look like this.

00:01:47.878 --> 00:01:48.784
Here's three

00:01:48.784 --> 00:01:49.725
and four

00:01:49.725 --> 00:01:50.715
and five,

00:01:50.715 --> 00:01:51.420
six,

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.964
seven,

00:01:51.964 --> 00:01:52.439
eight,

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:52.920
nine,

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:53.231
ten,

00:01:53.231 --> 00:01:53.551
eleven,

00:01:53.551 --> 00:01:54.306
twelve,

00:01:54.306 --> 00:01:56.391
I could go on.

00:01:56.391 --> 00:01:57.776
In a single drop of water,

00:01:57.776 --> 00:02:00.146
hydrogen bonds form extended networks

00:02:00.146 --> 00:02:02.034
between hundreds, thousands, millions,

00:02:02.034 --> 00:02:04.201
billions, trillions of molecules,

00:02:04.201 --> 00:02:07.613
and these bonds are constantly breaking and reforming.

00:02:07.613 --> 00:02:09.816
Now, back to our water as it cools down.

00:02:09.816 --> 00:02:11.873
Above 4 degrees Celcius,

00:02:11.873 --> 00:02:13.524
the kinetic energy of the water molecules

00:02:13.524 --> 00:02:16.529
keeps their interactions with each other short.

00:02:16.529 --> 00:02:18.450
Hydrogen bonds form and break

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.275
like high school relationships,

00:02:20.275 --> 00:02:22.588
that is to say, quickly.

00:02:22.588 --> 00:02:23.782
But below 4 degrees,

00:02:23.782 --> 00:02:25.713
the kinetic energy of the water molecules

00:02:25.713 --> 00:02:27.776
starts to fall below the energy

00:02:27.776 --> 00:02:29.671
of the hydrogen bonds.

00:02:29.671 --> 00:02:32.302
So, hydrogen bonds form much more frequently

00:02:32.302 --> 00:02:33.627
than they break

00:02:33.627 --> 00:02:35.479
and beautiful structures start to emerge

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:37.113
from the chaos.

00:02:37.113 --> 00:02:39.452
This is what solid water, ice,

00:02:39.452 --> 00:02:41.946
looks like on the molecular level.

00:02:41.946 --> 00:02:44.303
Notice that the ordered, hexagonal structure

00:02:44.303 --> 00:02:47.003
is less dense than the disordered structure

00:02:47.003 --> 00:02:48.739
of liquid water.

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:50.941
And you know that if an object is less dense

00:02:50.941 --> 00:02:52.370
than the fluid it's in,

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:53.646
it will float.

00:02:53.646 --> 00:02:55.529
So, ice floats on water,

00:02:55.529 --> 00:02:56.727
so what?

00:02:56.727 --> 00:02:59.640
Well, let's consider a world without floating ice.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:00.999
The coldest part of the ocean

00:03:00.999 --> 00:03:03.237
would be the pitch-black ocean floor,

00:03:03.237 --> 00:03:05.162
once frozen, always frozen.

00:03:05.162 --> 00:03:06.569
Forget lobster rolls

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:08.492
since crustaceans would lose their habitats,

00:03:08.492 --> 00:03:11.144
or sushi since kelp forests wouldn't grow.

00:03:11.144 --> 00:03:13.261
What would Canadian kids do in winter

00:03:13.261 --> 00:03:15.348
without pond hockey or ice fishing?

00:03:15.348 --> 00:03:17.134
And forget James Cameron's Oscar

00:03:17.134 --> 00:03:20.262
because the Titanic totally would have made it.

00:03:20.262 --> 00:03:22.088
Say goodbye to the white polar ice caps

00:03:22.088 --> 00:03:23.162
reflecting sunlight

00:03:23.162 --> 00:03:25.099
that would otherwise bake the planet.

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:27.292
In fact, forget the oceans as we know them,

00:03:27.292 --> 00:03:29.692
which at over 70% of the Earth's surface area,

00:03:29.692 --> 00:03:32.110
regulate the atmosphere of the whole planet.

00:03:32.524 --> 00:03:33.862
But worst of all,

00:03:33.862 --> 00:03:37.246
there would be no iced tea.

00:03:37.246 --> 00:03:40.384
Mmmmm, iced tea.
