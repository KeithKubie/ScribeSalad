00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:04.880
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: It's a pleasure to welcome
all of you to Google New York.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:09.180
We have today Gail Simmons in conversation
with Frank Bruni.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:14.809
As many of you Gail Simmons is perhaps best
known for her role as a judge on Bravo's Top

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:16.880
Chef, an Emmy Award winning show.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:27.579
As well as her hosting role on Bravo's Top
Chef Just Desserts and she is today releasing

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:33.250
her new memoir called Talking with My Mouth
Full, which chronicles her role, her evolution

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.950
from amateur eater to a professional eater.

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.310
A role I think many of us envy here at Google.

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:43.140
We are lucky enough to have her in conversation
today with the legendary critic of the New

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.640
York Times, Frank Bruni.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.190
Please welcome Gail Simmons and Frank Bruni.

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.270
[Applause]
&gt;&gt;Gail Simmons: Hi Frank.

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.570
&gt;&gt;Frank Bruni: Hi Gail, how are you?

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.145
&gt;&gt;Gail Simmons: I'm good, thanks for coming
today.

00:00:57.145 --> 00:00:58.670
&gt;&gt;Frank Bruni: I'm honored to do it.

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.790
If you guys have not picked up a copy of Gail's
book, I recommend it.

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.390
You, if I can begin with a compliment-
&gt;&gt;Gail Simmons: Sure

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.420
&gt;&gt;Frank Bruni: -I read a lot of memoirs-
&gt;&gt;Gail Simmons: Yes.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:13.140
&gt;&gt;Frank Bruni: -and I think one of the hardest
things is to write in, with a sort of conversational

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.670
allure of the way you speak.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.420
And I saw you in the book and it's a delightful
breezy read and-

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:20.420
&gt;&gt;Gail Simmons: Thank you.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:21.820
&gt;&gt;Frank Bruni: -we'll talk a little about
that now.

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.100
&gt;&gt;Gail Simmons: Yeah, thank you.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.389
&gt;&gt;Frank Bruni: Since we're here on the day
of the book's publication, what made you decide

00:01:26.389 --> 00:01:27.389
to write the book?

00:01:27.389 --> 00:01:30.679
&gt;&gt;Gail Simmons: You know it's a funny thing,
and actually Frank has written his own memoir

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:35.359
too, so I'm sure you will understand the angst
involved?

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:40.200
When I set out to write a book, I wanted to
write a book, I wanted to tell my story and

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.490
my first instinct in doing that was to write
a cookbook because in the food universe, or

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.049
in the food landscape, that's sort of what
everyone goes to first.

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:52.600
But when I started thinking more about it,
I thought the story I wanted to tell, I couldn't

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.420
really do that way.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.130
There are so many questions that always come
up.

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:04.859
First of all I don't cook on television, I
eat on television and so the questions I get

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:09.900
I think are slightly different than most people
who are chefs on television or who are cooking

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:12.370
for a living as opposed to eating, publicly.

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.860
Which sounds crass but that's what I do.

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:20.060
So I started sort of thinking, well there's
about 20 to 25 questions that I always get.

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.470
From people on the street, from strangers,
from my family and from my friends, from journalists

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.250
and I started answering them.

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.730
Sort of writing them down and answering them
over a series of a few months and realized

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.530
that the best way to answer them, for the
public, was to tell the story of how I got

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.040
here in the first place.

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.280
So that's what I decided to do.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.010
&gt;&gt;Frank Bruni: Now you just said people know
you as a public eater-

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.010
&gt;&gt;Gail Simmons: mmm hmm
&gt;&gt;Frank Bruni: - not as a cook.

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.460
But one of the things that, I knew this about
you, but I was reacquainted with it when I

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:48.020
read the book; you have serious cooking chops.

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:49.020
You have education.

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.020
Tell people a little about-
&gt;&gt;Gail Simmons: I do.

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.260
&gt;&gt;Frank Bruni ñ the path before you ended
up at Food &amp;Wine Magazine.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.430
&gt;&gt;Gail Simmons: Well, you know and it's interesting
because as much as I eat on television, also

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.390
one of the questions I get so often is really
like, what do you know?

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.730
Like how made you- you just woke up one day
and decide to eat and be mean to people?

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:03.730
&gt;&gt;Frank Bruni: Right.

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:04.730
&gt;&gt;Gail Simmons: For a living?

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:05.730
[Audience laughs]
&gt;&gt;Gail Simmons: Which is not true.

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.590
I'm actually relatively nice most of the time-
&gt;&gt;Frank Bruni: And you'd already been mean

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:09.590
to people before.

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:10.590
&gt;&gt;Gail Simmons: Right.

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:11.590
Yes, exactly-
&gt;&gt;Frank Bruni: Yeah, so you-

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:12.620
&gt;&gt;Gail Simmons: Exactly, I've been mean to
people for years.

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.150
But I do, I used to cook.

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:15.850
I was a cook.

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:17.250
I would not ever call myself a chef.

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:22.960
I did not lead a kitchen, but I cooked in
kitchens and I went to culinary school.

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:27.730
I was in college trying to figure out what
we're all trying to figure out when we graduate

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.470
from college and feel kind of hopelessly lost
and disappointed in myself that I couldn't

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.400
get up the strength and energy to write my
LSAT's and be a layer like my family wanted

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.230
me to.

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.490
But realized that I really loved to write
and I really loved to cook and so I got a

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:45.250
job in journalism.

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:51.242
I was living in Canada, I grew up in Toronto
and I got a job as an intern at a magazine,

00:03:51.242 --> 00:03:53.770
at the city magazine of Toronto called Toronto
Life.

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:56.300
It's actually a award winning publication,
great writing.

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.560
You know somewhat of a New York magazine.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.840
But it's a monthly and I was an intern there
and that's when I realized, wow people write

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.420
restaurant reviews for a living and write
about food and there's so much going on in

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:11.080
the city, the energy that I had never known
before, when I was young.

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.880
And I realized that food was sort of the beat
that I wanted to cover.

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:21.890
But I was 22 years old and there was stiff
competition for those very coveted jobs.

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:25.100
So I went to my editor and sort of asked you
know how do I do this?

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.660
I want to be a food writer.

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.850
Food writer, big dream.

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:35.639
And he said you know, that's all well and
nice Gail but any writer, no matter what you

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:40.250
want to cover, you need to be the owner of
that craft, you need to be an authority, an

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:44.820
expert, or else what makes you different than
the other you know, thousands of people who

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.990
want to be a food writer as well?

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:54.490
Now, at the time the Food Network was very
new, I just got an email address that same

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:58.450
year, so now I'm dating myself but you can
imagine, like that's where we were, imagine

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:00.740
where we were in the world of technology?

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:08.280
Yes, there was Google, in its infancy I guess
and I had just got an email address, there

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.550
were no blog, no one knew what blogs were.

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:15.910
There just wasnít the proliferation of writing
and media around food.

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:17.570
So there were very few jobs available.

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:24.050
And he really suggested, if you want to write
about food you need to learn how to cook.

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:25.050
You need to learn about food.

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:27.200
There's kind of no way to do it, you need
to be an authority.

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:32.520
So I packed up my bags and left Canada and
I moved here and went to culinary school.

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:37.280
And I then, from there went to work in kitchens,
because I thought when I graduated culinary

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:42.810
school that I would just snap my fingers and
get a job at Gourmet Magazine and be a food

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:44.610
writer and the world would be perfect.

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:48.860
But my career counselor at culinary school
brought it to my attention that just because

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:53.160
you've done everything once, doesn't make
you a chef, doesnít make you an expert.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.030
Same as you know, you graduate medical school,
I donít want you performing open heart surgery

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:57.030
on me.

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:03.020
It's kind of dramatic but you know, you still
arenít, you don't know it enough.

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:04.750
So he convinced me to go work on the line.

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:07.980
So I cooked here, in New York, for a little
while.

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:15.380
At two very extraordinary, high quality restaurants
where I got my butt handed to me.

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:17.020
&gt;&gt;Frank Bruni: Very different restaurants-
&gt;&gt;Gail Simmons: Very different restaurants-

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:18.020
&gt;&gt;Frank Bruni: -from each other.

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:20.840
&gt;&gt;Gail Simmons: Right, one was sort of very
classic four star, it was at the time four

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:30.430
star you know Le Cirque, which in its day,
in its heyday at sort of the end of the 90s

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:35.130
was really the kind of power dining restaurant
in New York.

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:38.520
And it was an extraordinary place to cook
because it had an open kitchen.

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:43.840
So I could stand on the line every night and
watch really like the leaders of industry

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:48.919
and of the country and movie stars and you
know, all these extraordinary people eat the

00:06:48.919 --> 00:06:49.919
food that I would make them.

00:06:49.919 --> 00:06:54.800
Which, you know I was 23 now, was really an
amazing kind of moment to be cooking in New

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:55.800
York.

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:58.410
There was, you know money was flowing like
water.

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:00.840
Remember those days?

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:06.820
So and then from there I went to work at Vong,
which is no longer open sadly, but John-Georges

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:11.590
Vongerichten's Thai fusion restaurant, which
at the time was ground breaking.

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:17.479
It really was one of the first restaurants
in the country that really highlighted Southeast

00:07:17.479 --> 00:07:18.790
Asian cooking.

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:25.260
With, you know, very classic technique and
it was an amazing place too because of the

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:26.380
ingredients I got to use.

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:28.020
I had otherwise never seen before.

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:31.760
And from there I went back to writing, because
I knew all the time when I was cooking that

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:33.120
I didnít want to be a chef.

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:35.729
I needed to just learn how to just speak the
language.

00:07:35.729 --> 00:07:37.729
&gt;&gt;Frank Bruni: We'll come back to your Jeffrey
Steingarten experience.

00:07:37.729 --> 00:07:38.729
&gt;&gt;Gail: Yes.

00:07:38.729 --> 00:07:39.729
Yes.

00:07:39.729 --> 00:07:40.729
&gt;&gt;Frank: But before we go there-
&gt;&gt;Gail: Yeah.

00:07:40.729 --> 00:07:44.440
&gt;&gt;Frank: - you say in the book, a big conversation
ongoing in the culinary world all the time

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:46.800
is why there aren't more female chefs.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:49.440
And in the book, you say you got a little
bit of an insight into that ñ

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:50.440
&gt;&gt;Gail: Yes.

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:51.440
&gt;&gt;Frank: -from your time in those kitchens.

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:52.440
Talk about that.

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:58.520
&gt;&gt;Gail: You know, it's a just interesting
and delicate conversation because, obviously

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:04.410
people get very upset and rightfully so, at
last check, and I donít want to be quoted

00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:08.080
on this position, and maybe I shouldn't say
this, because this is being recorded.

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:14.270
But you know, there is no denying, it is a
fact, it is a scientific fact, it is a mathematical

00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:19.880
equation that there are less women in kitchens,
cooking in professional kitchens, than men.

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:24.840
I'm not being sexist by saying that, it's
known.

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:30.650
And so people are always asking why why why,
is it that women aren't as good cooks as men,

00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:35.539
are women not as strong and as you know, able
as men?

00:08:35.539 --> 00:08:38.070
You know we get that on Top Chef all the time.

00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:41.960
Why haven't more women won Top Chef than men?

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:47.940
And the answer I think is a lot simpler than
people want to make it.

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:53.050
And I am simplifying things; I understand
it's a massive topic and a huge conversation.

00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:59.300
What I found working in restaurants is really,
it's biological and in a lot of ways, over

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:03.920
simplifying it it's the same reason that there
are a lot less women who are plumbers than

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:04.920
men.

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:08.070
That's not to say that women wouldn't make
great plumbers but itís a very physically

00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:10.760
demanding job.

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:13.770
And it's demanding in ways-
&gt;&gt;Frank: In crude ways.

00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:14.770
&gt;&gt;Gail: In crude ways.

00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:17.350
I mean it's really, it's physical manual labor.

00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:24.420
Until you are the chef, meaning the head of
a kitchen you know, the word chef really means

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:28.680
boss, so until you are the boss you are a
line cook, you are a cook.

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:33.450
And you are really executing someone else's
vision and you are doing manual labor.

00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:37.779
You know, you're not really using your own
creative skills; you are executing something

00:09:37.779 --> 00:09:41.950
for someone else's menu that needs to be exactly
the same hundred times a day, every single

00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:44.620
day of the year, 7 days a week.

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:48.920
And so it's very physically demanding, you're
on your feet in front of fire using knives.

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:54.420
Women can do all that stuff, there's no question,
I think actually a kitchen really is a meritocracy

00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:57.600
in terms of skill and ability.

00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:03.230
What I think comes into play when you think
about women at high levels in kitchens is

00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:09.060
that lets say it takes 10 years to be a chef,
to really become the head of a kitchen.

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:12.620
You know, by the time you go through culinary
school and work your way up the line as you

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:17.209
need to do to really become a professional
chef at that high level.

00:10:17.209 --> 00:10:23.810
So let's say you started around 20-22, biologically
until we as women can figure out a way to

00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:33.190
have men nurse and carry, physically inside,
our babies, you know when you-

00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:38.940
After 10 years of working in a kitchen it's
very hard, it's very hard to have to be a

00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:44.570
mother and work evenings weekends and holidays
as chefs need to do cause that's when the

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:45.570
kitchen is open.

00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:47.160
You know, the shop is open you have to be
there.

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:54.190
That's not to say that women don't do it,
but much less women are able to sustain it

00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:55.250
than men.

00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:59.360
It doesnít mean we're not bad ass and it
doesnít mean we're not hardcore and awesome

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:02.670
and strong and there's some amazing female
chefs.

00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:06.500
But if you kinda look at New York, and obviously
New York is the toughest restaurant town,

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:07.500
we all know.

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:08.850
Frank knows better than anyone.

00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:18.220
And the restaurant world, which makes me sad
but if you can think of five, I ask this in

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:21.470
the book and it's always a test and I'd love
someone to prove me wrong.

00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:29.000
Name five women who run New York City kitchens,
who run more than two New York City kitchens.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.420
It's almost impossible.

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:34.860
I can tell you 12 men in New York who run
5 or more kitchens all over the world.

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:38.440
And I don't think that's because men aren't-
women aren't as good as that.

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:42.640
I think it's just because it's physically
very difficult for women to be in 5 places

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:47.790
and still have the responsibilities that we
still have at home.

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:50.970
&gt;&gt;Frank: You- How many people here know who
Jeffrey Steingarten is?

00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:51.970
Most people?

00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:53.060
Ok, so good.

00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:56.680
How many of you knew that Gail worked for
him for a couple years?

00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:57.800
&gt;&gt;Gail: And did [unintelligible].

00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:58.920
&gt;&gt;Frank: Wow, they're pretty good.

00:11:58.920 --> 00:11:59.980
&gt;&gt;Gail: There we go, yeah.

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:01.350
&gt;&gt;Frank: You guys are good Gail-ologists.

00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:02.350
&gt;&gt;Gail: Thank you.

00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:05.350
Yes, that's a major-
&gt;&gt;Frank: What you don't know until you read

00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:08.010
the book is what the experience of working
with him is like.

00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:11.490
So let's first talk about his chocolate and
diet Coke habit.

00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:13.050
&gt;&gt;Gail: Oh yes.

00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:16.190
You know, it's funny I really wrote this as
a love letter to him.

00:12:16.190 --> 00:12:18.870
It really remains to be seen if he will-
&gt;&gt;Frank: Love letter?

00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:20.540
&gt;&gt;Gail: - take it that way.

00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:25.339
You know, working for Jeffrey was the greatest
education I could have ever asked for.

00:12:25.339 --> 00:12:28.750
Yes, culinary school taught me how to cook
but Jeffrey taught me how to read, how to

00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:31.020
do research.

00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:36.140
And there's no question I think, it's no secret
that you know, he has a lot of eccentricities

00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:37.380
that-
&gt;&gt;Frank: Talk about your interview for the

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:38.380
job.

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:40.350
&gt;&gt;Gail: Yes and he has a diet Coke and chocolate
habit.

00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:44.690
Which you know, the chocolate part I'm all
for, diet Coke is a personal preference.

00:12:44.690 --> 00:12:52.420
But he ñ the interview process kind of says
it all and rightfully so.

00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:56.260
Everyone wants to think that he is sort of
this mad scientist, which he is in a lot of

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:57.260
ways.

00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:00.510
But after working for him for a long time
I came to realize it's much more calculated

00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:02.820
than that.

00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:06.740
You know, he's the food critic for Vogue and
he has this long line of women who have been

00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:09.110
his assistants over the years.

00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:14.310
We all last about 2 years, some a little more
a little less depending.

00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:21.600
And I came to him because I'd never read Vogue
in my life, until I went to work for Jeffrey.

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:24.760
It's you know, the greatest fashion publication
ever in the world.

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:26.820
But I was never a very fashionable person.

00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:32.040
Especially until my early 20s I couldnít
have told ya the name of a designer label

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:33.899
if I tried.

00:13:33.899 --> 00:13:38.269
But when I was at culinary school and cooking
on the line, someone gave me his book to read

00:13:38.269 --> 00:13:42.350
"The Man Who Ate Everything" which you should
add to your reading lists, if you haven't

00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:43.350
already read it.

00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:49.209
I think it's one the greatest food, pieces
of food writing ever.

00:13:49.209 --> 00:13:51.770
And I decided this is the man I want to work
for.

00:13:51.770 --> 00:13:57.770
In it he talks about his assistant how one
day she's searching for a very rare ingredient

00:13:57.770 --> 00:14:01.120
in Chinatown and the next day she's testing
recipes and the next day she's doing research

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:03.630
for him and interviewing the greatest chefs
in the world.

00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:05.370
And I thought this is my job.

00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:07.490
I want to be a food writer and this is the
job I need.

00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:11.300
So I went to my culinary school after I'd
been cooking on the line and said, do you

00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:12.360
guys know this man?

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:13.710
I didn't know if anyone knew him.

00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:16.589
I didn't know he was acclaimed as he was.

00:14:16.589 --> 00:14:21.110
And they said, yes, actually we do know him
and we happen to know he's looking for an

00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:22.110
assistant.

00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:26.300
So serendipity definitely played a role.

00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:31.540
So they got me an interview with him and I
showed up at his house after cooking one night.

00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:35.610
I was cooking the lunch shift at Vong, so
I finished every day around 6 o'clock and

00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:41.089
I went to his house and he kept me there for
about 3 hours.

00:14:41.089 --> 00:14:45.260
It was the most grueling; I mean really, people
should be studying his methods.

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:50.450
It was the most grueling interview I'd ever
done, will ever do I think in my life.

00:14:50.450 --> 00:14:53.150
He made me taste wine and give him my tasting
notes.

00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:56.200
He made me translate off the cuff Spanish
and French.

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:59.339
Because you know everyone puts in their resume
because we all took some Spanish.

00:14:59.339 --> 00:15:03.030
I actually, my Spanish is pretty good my French
is pretty good but you know, you put on your

00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:06.850
resume at the bottom languages, French and
Spanish and he was like great here you go

00:15:06.850 --> 00:15:09.790
read this book and translate it for me.

00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:14.959
It was actually, it was a book by, the Spanish
book he gave me was a cookbook by Ferran Adria,

00:15:14.959 --> 00:15:17.829
one of the greatest chefs of all time at El
Bulli.

00:15:17.829 --> 00:15:22.310
And I had to kinda translate, sight unseen,
his recipes.

00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:28.351
Very complicated recipes that use you know,
very esoteric ingredients like you know, a

00:15:28.351 --> 00:15:35.900
lot of powders and crazy chemicals that at
the time I had never heard of before.

00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:37.680
So that was an adventure.

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:43.020
He definitely criticized a lot of my answers
and I walked out of there thinking well that

00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:45.680
was a complete failure.

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:47.920
I really bombed that, like I couldn't believe.

00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:51.050
But you know what; I got to spend 3 hours
with Jeffrey Steingarten.

00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:53.050
And even in the interview I learned so much.

00:15:53.050 --> 00:15:57.519
At the time I remember, I didnít know what
a tamale was.

00:15:57.519 --> 00:16:00.480
I'm from Canada, I just want to say that again
one more time.

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:03.269
[audience laughs]
&gt;&gt;Gail: We donít have, we donít have a lot

00:16:03.269 --> 00:16:07.130
of great Mexican, there isn't the Mexican
community in Canada that there is here.

00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:10.010
There is, you know, I had not ever really
eaten great Mexican food, I didnít know what

00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:11.079
a tamale was.

00:16:11.079 --> 00:16:15.630
I thought it was a plant, maybe a vegetable
and he had just gotten back from a tamale

00:16:15.630 --> 00:16:20.209
festival where he had been judging a competition
and he was talking about them and I- it was

00:16:20.209 --> 00:16:25.660
just embarrassing when I think back at how
many mistakes I made in that interview.

00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:28.459
But he called me a week later and offered
me the job.

00:16:28.459 --> 00:16:33.420
And what I found amazing after working for
him, what I realized was that what I had said

00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:34.570
kinda didnít matter.

00:16:34.570 --> 00:16:39.339
He was just testing sort of my strength of
character and that I wouldnít buckle under

00:16:39.339 --> 00:16:45.160
his demands and that when I started working
for him I realized that there was this incredible

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:50.079
network of women who worked for him before
me and his bookkeeper who was working there

00:16:50.079 --> 00:16:53.310
at the same time as me and who went to work
for him after me.

00:16:53.310 --> 00:16:59.589
And we all kinda share this very same, I guess
strength, I had two older brothers and so

00:16:59.589 --> 00:17:03.850
I got bullied a lot as a kid, in a good way
you know teased and pushed.

00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:05.660
Knew how to provoke me.

00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:08.040
But ultimately were always really protective
of me.

00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:13.850
And Jeffrey could sort of see that and knew
that I wouldnít put up with any of his shtick.

00:17:13.850 --> 00:17:16.290
And so we ended up really getting along well.

00:17:16.290 --> 00:17:17.360
He definitely pushed my buttons.

00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:22.110
But he also taught me so much about food and
eating and-

00:17:22.110 --> 00:17:23.970
&gt;&gt;Frank: And about the decomposition of beef.

00:17:23.970 --> 00:17:29.970
&gt;&gt;Gail: And about, exactly, about how quickly
beef could rot when left on a counter in July

00:17:29.970 --> 00:17:32.300
in an unairconditioned apartment with maggots.

00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:36.660
So that was a really educational moment in
my life, for sure.

00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:38.980
&gt;&gt;Frank: You said he made you taste the wine
and give your tasting notes.

00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:42.190
In the book you also say he made you guess
the grape, but you donít tell us whether

00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:43.190
you got the guess right.

00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:44.940
&gt;&gt;Gail: I didnít get the grape right.

00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:48.550
I mean it was a red, it was a Spanish red.

00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:52.850
Of course, I mean I was 23 I'd only been drinking
legally for 2 years in this country anyway.

00:17:52.850 --> 00:17:54.780
In Canada I'd been drinking since I was 14.

00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:59.110
[Audience giggle]
&gt;&gt;Gail: But, not that that's legal and I'd

00:17:59.110 --> 00:18:00.110
never did it.

00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:01.431
&gt;&gt;Frank: Not that you're, you're not advising
anybody.

00:18:01.431 --> 00:18:05.410
&gt;&gt;Gail: I was responsible, I was never driving,
you should never- Anyway, that's bad.

00:18:05.410 --> 00:18:08.120
But I didn't get it right.

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:12.630
I didnít get the grape right but I definitely
gave him decent notes.

00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:17.309
Like I could tell the you know, kind of the
general characteristics of the wine.

00:18:17.309 --> 00:18:22.669
You know, it was very spicy and it was a pretty
full bodied red like you know, a Spanish red

00:18:22.669 --> 00:18:23.669
wine.

00:18:23.669 --> 00:18:27.100
That's all I remember about it but I remember
being ridiculed because I had no idea really

00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:28.470
what I was talking about.

00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:30.080
All good lessons to learn.

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:34.660
&gt;&gt;Frank: In all of this time, in the cooking
in the kitchens, working with Jeffrey are

00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:37.210
you ever thinking I want to be on TV?

00:18:37.210 --> 00:18:38.440
&gt;&gt;Gail: Never.

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:42.920
There wasn't really, I mean I guess there
was food television, the Food Network existed.

00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:46.390
Julia Child certainly, I mean that's kind
of the funny thing about food television,

00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:48.271
that we talk about it as its new.

00:18:48.271 --> 00:18:53.510
And I still think of food television, certainly
food competition, you know reality, the mix

00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:57.270
of reality television and food television
as a very new thing.

00:18:57.270 --> 00:19:01.480
Julia Child had been cooking on television
since the 60s so it's actually not and Jacques

00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:07.210
PÈpin certainly, it's not that new but it
was not in my consciousness the way that now

00:19:07.210 --> 00:19:09.520
people tell me every day they want to be on
television, they want to cook on television,

00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:10.520
they want to be a chef.

00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:12.700
To a lot of people, being a chef is being
on television.

00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:13.970
There's an irony there.

00:19:13.970 --> 00:19:21.049
But certainly it was never anything that entered
my mind really until I was told to go on television.

00:19:21.049 --> 00:19:24.531
&gt;&gt;Frank: So talk a little bit about how, I
mean you're at Food &amp; Wine magazine at that

00:19:24.531 --> 00:19:28.140
point, how you end up through no particular-
&gt;&gt;Gail: Right.

00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:32.540
&gt;&gt;Frank: -designs at it or cut concerted effort
ending up on Top Chef.

00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:39.450
&gt;&gt;Gail: I, when I left Jeffrey I went to work
for Daniel Boulud a many years, chef of many

00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:44.030
many restaurants all over the world but certainly
he's a New York, we can call him our own even

00:19:44.030 --> 00:19:45.030
if he's French.

00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:48.630
He's certainly our adopted hero.

00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:54.750
And I worked for him in public relations,
so for many years I spent time working behind

00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:57.390
the scenes on everything that Daniel did on
television.

00:19:57.390 --> 00:20:03.740
So I came to know a lot of the sort of food
producers in the city and a lot of food media

00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:05.140
magazines and newspaper.

00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:10.000
And I came to know the people at Food &amp; Wine
magazine which is how I then moved to go work

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.350
for Food &amp; Wine where, which has been my sort
of home for seven years now.

00:20:14.350 --> 00:20:19.910
But when I first went to Food &amp; Wine, the
person whose job I had taken had done a lot

00:20:19.910 --> 00:20:23.220
of television for them kind of as their brand
ambassador.

00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:31.320
He'd gone on television to talk, then what
that meant was when New York One or the Today

00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:38.090
Show, the early show, needed someone to talk
about recipes for Easter dinner or wine bargains

00:20:38.090 --> 00:20:42.820
or outdoor entertaining in the summer time,
he would be the one to do the cooking segments.

00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:46.750
So when he left there was sort of a hole,
our Editor in Chief couldn't do all of it

00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:50.580
and she actually you know, as much as she
is an incredible knowledge of food, she's

00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:53.320
not had professional cooking training.

00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:57.480
And I happened to have that professional cooking
training that the guy before me had had so

00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:02.450
when I first went they asked if I would do
a little media training and start doing those

00:21:02.450 --> 00:21:05.080
type of segments.

00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:09.990
So I started doing segments here and there,
small things like that on television two or

00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:11.090
three minutes.

00:21:11.090 --> 00:21:17.000
Very nerve wracking, and I try not to do this
very often, you look at back on those early

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:23.350
segments it was mortifying, I was so nervous
because it's very hard to do live television.

00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:28.760
And I started doing more and more of it and
started to being a little else's nervous and

00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:33.670
about a year into my job, which this whole
part of my job was a very side piece.

00:21:33.670 --> 00:21:39.429
It was kind of my extracurricular activity
on the side and when I was simultaneously

00:21:39.429 --> 00:21:47.620
running part of the marketing department at
Food &amp; Wine, I was called into the VP of Marketing's

00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:50.549
office, she's now our publisher but at the
time she was our VP of Marketing.

00:21:50.549 --> 00:21:55.780
And she called me into her office on like
a random Tuesday in September and said so,

00:21:55.780 --> 00:22:00.820
we're thinking of doing this reality food
show with Bravo, we havenít really ironed

00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:04.850
out the details but we're doing a partnership
with them and they want to interview a bunch

00:22:04.850 --> 00:22:08.040
of our editors and if they like you they might
have you on as kind of a guest judge.

00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:13.020
So can you go to 30 Rock tomorrow morning
at 8 am and do a little screen test?

00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:17.370
And my first reaction was I don't know what
a screen test is.

00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:22.010
And I donít watch reality television and
I'm scared to death of reality television

00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:24.940
because at the time too, reality television
at the time.

00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:32.770
This was 2005, we've come a long way in the
6ish years since this happened.

00:22:32.770 --> 00:22:35.000
Six and a half years.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:40.440
You know, reality television to me at the
time meant Fear Factor or Survivor.

00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:45.000
So in my head, the only thing that I can think
is like how am I gonna tell my mother that

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:51.299
I'm gonna be like on a desert island eating
bugs you know, tied to a tree or something

00:22:51.299 --> 00:22:53.380
crazy like that.

00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:55.870
And what is Food &amp; Wine putting me up to?

00:22:55.870 --> 00:23:03.500
So I went to 30 Rock and they put me, Bravo
ñ the producer for Bravo put me in a little

00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:07.789
room with a camera and started asking me questions.

00:23:07.789 --> 00:23:12.020
And at the end of the interview I sort of
thought; alright well that was that and I

00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:13.039
didnít think twice about it.

00:23:13.039 --> 00:23:14.990
And for a month we didnít hear anything.

00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:22.650
And in early October our publisher got a call
from Bravo saying "We're making the show,

00:23:22.650 --> 00:23:26.820
it's called Top Chef and we need Gail to fly
to San Francisco to shoot the first season."

00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:30.130
So I literally packed up everything I owned
and went there literally thinking I would

00:23:30.130 --> 00:23:35.610
go for 3 weeks, I left my job, I mean I have
a full time job, I would go for weeks 3 and

00:23:35.610 --> 00:23:38.990
shoot this crazy show that I really had no
idea what it was even about.

00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:43.190
Although they promised me I would not be tied
to a tree eating bugs so that was good to

00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:44.990
know.

00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:48.620
And then I'd come back and go back to my life
and it would all sort of be a flash in the

00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:49.620
pan.

00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:55.150
And 9 seasons and 2 spin offs and one really
shiny Emmy later, still eating but sometimes

00:23:55.150 --> 00:23:58.400
I'm eating on desert islands actually.

00:23:58.400 --> 00:23:59.520
But at least the foods been good.

00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:03.330
&gt;&gt;Frank Bruni: Did you have even a moment's
hesitation or were you on board from the beginning?

00:24:03.330 --> 00:24:04.550
&gt;&gt;Gail: Oh I had a lot of hesitation.

00:24:04.550 --> 00:24:05.789
&gt;&gt;Frank Bruni: What were your reservations?

00:24:05.789 --> 00:24:12.900
&gt;&gt;Gail: A couple, you know I have this, Tom
and I joke a lot about it now.

00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:18.610
There was a moment the first day, so I get
to San Francisco, and I'm alone and Bravo

00:24:18.610 --> 00:24:23.160
and Food &amp; Wine are still sorting out the
contract.

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:26.870
So because it hasnít been signed no one from
Bravo is talking to me.

00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:32.730
And I'm sort of alone in San Francisco sitting
at the bar at Delfina Pizzeria, really delicious,

00:24:32.730 --> 00:24:34.309
I'm thinking you know what did I get myself
into?

00:24:34.309 --> 00:24:38.500
I'm kind of alone here for 3 weeks of my life
and my husband who- I wasnít actually married

00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:43.039
to him, the person who became my husband I'm
calling like at night crying sad and lonely,

00:24:43.039 --> 00:24:44.360
not sure how this was gonna go.

00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:50.690
And I got to set that first day and I sat
beside Tom, who I had met many years before

00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:53.850
when I worked for Jeffrey Steingarten and
actually I was very good friends with Tom's

00:24:53.850 --> 00:24:57.900
ex-assistant, so we sort of had a familiarity
about each other.

00:24:57.900 --> 00:25:03.320
Tom had worked with Food &amp; Wine all the time,
so we knew each other vaguely but not well.

00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:06.059
I remember looking at him and thinking what
have we done?

00:25:06.059 --> 00:25:08.440
What is this?

00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:15.539
And I think both of our fears were- I wasnít
so worried that the show would fail, because,

00:25:15.539 --> 00:25:21.050
it didn't bother me so much if strangers sort
of in you know, some other state somewhere

00:25:21.050 --> 00:25:24.110
and watched the show and didn't like it and
said bad things and then it went off the air.

00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:31.159
Our other, my biggest fear was that my friends
and my peers in the food industry would laugh

00:25:31.159 --> 00:25:32.159
at us.

00:25:32.159 --> 00:25:33.159
That it wouldnít be taken seriously.

00:25:33.159 --> 00:25:40.660
That it would be you know that we would be
selling out, so to speak.

00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:45.290
That the food would be sort of a joke and
that the chefs that they'd chosen would would

00:25:45.290 --> 00:25:52.050
not be taken seriously and that I would embarrass
Food &amp; Wine and of course myself and I'd never

00:25:52.050 --> 00:25:55.700
work in this town again.

00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:59.850
And we got, I donít know, a cross between
lucky and really great TV making I guess.

00:25:59.850 --> 00:26:05.340
Our producers had the same reservations we
had and luckily really wanted to make the

00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:10.380
same show from the start that Tom and I wanted
to make.

00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:12.730
We wanted it to be about the chefs, not about
us.

00:26:12.730 --> 00:26:14.160
We wanted it to be about the food.

00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:15.870
We wanted the food to be served hot.

00:26:15.870 --> 00:26:22.150
We wanted it to be true and to feel authentic
to what it's really like to cook in a kitchen.

00:26:22.150 --> 00:26:26.880
Granted I understand that chefs are not cooking
for vending machines very often, but that

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:31.809
the lessons they were learning and that feeling
of sort of, the pressure and the sense of

00:26:31.809 --> 00:26:37.780
urgency in a kitchen and the skill and craft
of what these young chefs do every day would

00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:40.230
be, would be authenticated.

00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:44.240
And I think more or less, that's what we've
loved about the show.

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:47.460
&gt;&gt;Frank Bruni: Now that first season, since
Top Chef was new, it couldn't have been as

00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:50.550
powerful as a magnet for young chefs that
couldn't have been as-

00:26:50.550 --> 00:26:51.550
&gt;&gt;Gail Simmons: No.

00:26:51.550 --> 00:26:55.140
&gt;&gt;Frank Bruni: How does the food that first
season stack up against the food in subsequent

00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:56.140
seasons?

00:26:56.140 --> 00:26:57.140
&gt;&gt;Gail Simmons: Sure.

00:26:57.140 --> 00:26:58.140
&gt;&gt;Frank Bruni: When you presumably had more
people knocking on the door.

00:26:58.140 --> 00:26:59.140
&gt;&gt;Gail Simmons: Yeah, that's a great question.

00:26:59.140 --> 00:27:03.700
You know, I still to this day don't know how
they cast for the first season.

00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:06.450
How they actually got, lured people in because
there was no precedent.

00:27:06.450 --> 00:27:14.200
There were no other shows there was no season
before it to give it any sort of you know,

00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:18.140
precedent of what to expect or why chefs should
do it.

00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:21.410
And that first season, it's amazing to look
back, we've certainly changed a lot of the

00:27:21.410 --> 00:27:23.299
show's format that way.

00:27:23.299 --> 00:27:27.429
That first season there was a much greater
mix of chefs because we didnít know what

00:27:27.429 --> 00:27:30.180
our audience would want.

00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:34.559
There were, there was a girl who was in culinary
school, that would never happen today.

00:27:34.559 --> 00:27:39.890
There was a girl who was a very accomplished
home cook who taught cooking, she was a cooking

00:27:39.890 --> 00:27:43.280
teacher but in the very home sense, out of
her home.

00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:45.070
That would never happen today.

00:27:45.070 --> 00:27:50.480
And not that they weren't great but after
that first season we learned that our audience

00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:53.169
really wants this to be about professional
chefs.

00:27:53.169 --> 00:27:56.740
Chefs who are running restaurants at the highest
level around the country.

00:27:56.740 --> 00:28:02.910
And now that's the kind of chef that we have
you know, across the board.

00:28:02.910 --> 00:28:08.850
At this point, season nine, all of the chefs
in the show run restaurants, they're line

00:28:08.850 --> 00:28:15.169
cooks, they're sous-chef at the- and a sous-chef
is the second in command by the way.

00:28:15.169 --> 00:28:17.860
People think a sous-chef might be all the
little people running under them.

00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:21.580
The sous-chef is the chef who is the second
in command at a restaurant, so very- you have

00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:28.230
to work your way up to be a sous-chef or a
chef, a chef de cuisine an executive chef.

00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:33.250
And running really some of the greatest restaurants
around the country so we've certainly upped

00:28:33.250 --> 00:28:34.250
the ante.

00:28:34.250 --> 00:28:38.000
And that said, that first season there was
some awesome talent, too.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:44.039
I mean Harold Dieterle won that firs season
and he now two, soon to be three restaurants

00:28:44.039 --> 00:28:45.230
in New York.

00:28:45.230 --> 00:28:47.450
Very well reviewed by the New York Times.

00:28:47.450 --> 00:28:49.330
Did you ever review his restaurant?

00:28:49.330 --> 00:28:50.330
&gt;&gt;Frank Bruni: His first one, yes.

00:28:50.330 --> 00:28:51.330
&gt;&gt;Gail Simmons: His first one.

00:28:51.330 --> 00:28:55.350
You know he's done really really well, he
has two restaurants that are taken very seriously

00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:57.580
and he does an amazing job.

00:28:57.580 --> 00:29:00.920
You know several of the other, the chefs on
that first season have gone on to do great

00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:04.240
things and are still really going strong.

00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:09.360
It's interesting how it's become a vehicle
for them and how at last count, I can't even

00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:13.610
remember, how many chefs on our show, not
just winners but have you know, gone on to

00:29:13.610 --> 00:29:18.860
really run and earn successful award winning
restaurants.

00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:21.070
So we're really proud how that sort of evolved.

00:29:21.070 --> 00:29:24.211
&gt;&gt;Frank Bruni: Are there other particular
chef, you call them cheftestants right?

00:29:24.211 --> 00:29:26.510
&gt;&gt;Gail Simmons: Yeah yeah I didnít really
ñ thatís a Bravo word.

00:29:26.510 --> 00:29:29.620
[audience laughter]
&gt;&gt;Gail Simmons: Not in the dictionary.

00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:32.250
&gt;&gt;Frank Bruni: Oxford hasn't picked it up
yet?

00:29:32.250 --> 00:29:33.250
No?

00:29:33.250 --> 00:29:38.919
Are there cheftestants whose post-script to
Top Chef, their post-scripts have surprised

00:29:38.919 --> 00:29:40.600
you especially either-
&gt;&gt;Gail Simmons: Yes.

00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:43.179
&gt;&gt;Frank Bruni: -either because they've done
much better or because they faded and you

00:29:43.179 --> 00:29:44.179
thought this was-
&gt;&gt;Gail Simmons: Right

00:29:44.179 --> 00:29:45.390
&gt;&gt;Frank Bruni: - going to be an amazing spring
board for them?

00:29:45.390 --> 00:29:46.950
&gt;&gt;Gail Simmons: Both certainly.

00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:55.810
There have been, what's interesting is that
for a while it was hard to tell if this show

00:29:55.810 --> 00:30:00.140
was going to be taken, I mean as much as the
industry really embraced it as a follow up

00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:04.330
to the other question about my fears, I have
to say we've been really blessed that the

00:30:04.330 --> 00:30:06.330
industry really has loved it.

00:30:06.330 --> 00:30:10.840
We've had such incredible talent chefs, guest
judges on the show and beyond you know, the

00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:12.960
entertainment world has embraced it.

00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:18.220
There was a seven page article in the Hollywood
Reporter last week about Top Chef, so it's

00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:22.299
kind of had this amazing crossover appeal
and really great chefs have embraced it, you

00:30:22.299 --> 00:30:25.080
know contestants have just gotten better and
better.

00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:29.770
But we always, we get blamed when the chefs
didnít do well, afterwards that it's our

00:30:29.770 --> 00:30:30.770
fault.

00:30:30.770 --> 00:30:34.559
But actually we always say to the chefs we
give this opportunity, it's what you make

00:30:34.559 --> 00:30:35.559
of it.

00:30:35.559 --> 00:30:39.770
You can act however you want afterwards and
hopefully you'll take it and run with it and

00:30:39.770 --> 00:30:40.770
do a great job.

00:30:40.770 --> 00:30:41.770
And many have.

00:30:41.770 --> 00:30:46.070
You know, Michael Voltaggio who was the winner
of Top Chef 6 just opened a very serious restaurant

00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:51.260
in Los Angeles called Ink that you know, we're
all really excited, about Stephanie Izard

00:30:51.260 --> 00:30:55.490
in Chicago opened a restaurant called the
Girl &amp; the Goat which for me was sort of an

00:30:55.490 --> 00:31:00.830
amazing moment because she was awarded an
award last year by Food &amp; Wine magazine.

00:31:00.830 --> 00:31:05.419
We give this award the best new chef every
year, we honor the 10 sort of strongest up

00:31:05.419 --> 00:31:10.640
and coming chefs around the country who we
think will be the country's next generation

00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:11.800
of top talent.

00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:14.899
So I always have sat in the middle there because
I'm on Top Chef but Food &amp; Wine does this

00:31:14.899 --> 00:31:18.890
best new chef thing and they never crossed
and Stephanie won that award last year.

00:31:18.890 --> 00:31:23.399
So that was real big deal for me personally,
it felt really great to see that our Top Chefs

00:31:23.399 --> 00:31:26.240
really could be at that level.

00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:32.190
You know there's chefs like Fabio Viviani
who was on our fifth season who's you know,

00:31:32.190 --> 00:31:36.950
his restaurants have gotten kind of lukewarm
reviews but he's got them but he's also doing

00:31:36.950 --> 00:31:38.960
like Domino's pizza ads.

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:42.649
And I'm not saying that in a disappointed
way, it's unbelievable like you know, he's

00:31:42.649 --> 00:31:46.620
that main stream in America that he's really
crossed over to have that much success, that's

00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:48.800
a big deal that's a huge endorsement.

00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:53.870
You know everyone has to make their own decisions
and do what works for them and he has this

00:31:53.870 --> 00:31:58.529
amazing personality and he knows thatís his
strength and he's worked it and you know,

00:31:58.529 --> 00:31:59.740
he's done really well with it too.

00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:02.720
&gt;&gt;Frank Bruni: You make clear in the book,
and I think it's clear from watching Top Chef

00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:06.510
that you judges are pretty firmly segregated
from the contestants.

00:32:06.510 --> 00:32:07.510
&gt;&gt;Gail Simmons: Yes.

00:32:07.510 --> 00:32:08.510
&gt;&gt;Frank Bruni: -the cheftestants-
&gt;&gt;Gail Simmons: Yes.

00:32:08.510 --> 00:32:09.830
&gt;&gt;Frank Bruni: For the period you're judging
them.

00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:11.730
Are you allowed to become friendly with them
afterwards?

00:32:11.730 --> 00:32:12.730
Are some-
&gt;&gt;Gail Simmons: Afterwards.

00:32:12.730 --> 00:32:13.730
Sure.

00:32:13.730 --> 00:32:14.730
&gt;&gt;Frank Bruni: Are some of them good friends
of yours today?

00:32:14.730 --> 00:32:15.730
&gt;&gt;Gail Simmons: Absolutely.

00:32:15.730 --> 00:32:16.730
&gt;&gt;Frank Bruni: Which ones and how did it happen?

00:32:16.730 --> 00:32:19.730
&gt;&gt;Gail Simmons: You know we really do keep
separate from them.

00:32:19.730 --> 00:32:25.429
When you see the whole show put together,
as a viewer you see the kitchen and the action

00:32:25.429 --> 00:32:26.429
cooking.

00:32:26.429 --> 00:32:28.580
You see them in their interviews, you see
them in the house.

00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:31.700
And then you see them with us at the judges
table or at the challenges.

00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:34.159
We don't see any of that except where we are.

00:32:34.159 --> 00:32:38.070
Like when you see us physically at the challenge
at the judges table, that's the only time

00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:39.220
we the chefs.

00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:40.940
So we donít know any of that stuff that goes
on.

00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:42.039
We donít get to know them at all.

00:32:42.039 --> 00:32:47.070
We donít know who's mean and who's a villain
and who's the one getting bullied or who's

00:32:47.070 --> 00:32:48.160
the one who hates us.

00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:51.330
We donít know any of that and it actually
doesn't matter, it's what keeps us on the

00:32:51.330 --> 00:32:53.580
straight and narrow, that we just judge about
the food.

00:32:53.580 --> 00:32:58.330
When the show ends and we wait until the show
has aired completely, we donít have any contact

00:32:58.330 --> 00:33:02.951
with them at all, we could certainly you know,
get to know them a little more.

00:33:02.951 --> 00:33:06.110
And we start seeing them, you know the food
community is really small, we go to events

00:33:06.110 --> 00:33:07.110
and they're there.

00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:12.940
And you know Bravo keeps us all in this tight
little oddball family.

00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:14.490
But there aren't many that I become good friends
with.

00:33:14.490 --> 00:33:18.250
I mean certainly Harold Dieterle, you know
he was our number one guinea pig.

00:33:18.250 --> 00:33:23.600
And he has been so supportive and great and
has become a really good friend.

00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:27.390
You know the Voltaggio brothers I love; I
think they're just unbelievable cooks and

00:33:27.390 --> 00:33:29.590
really great guys.

00:33:29.590 --> 00:33:31.100
Stephanie Izard.

00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:36.429
Spike Mendelsohn who was on season 5 originally
and then was on All Star with us as well.

00:33:36.429 --> 00:33:37.970
He has great restaurants in DC.

00:33:37.970 --> 00:33:42.149
He's done so well and I love when I get to
hang out with him.

00:33:42.149 --> 00:33:45.110
Let me think.

00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:48.350
Oh Carla Hall, she has done so well.

00:33:48.350 --> 00:33:51.940
I mean she was an example, she was on season
five with us.

00:33:51.940 --> 00:33:55.419
She was the hooty hoo girl, does anyone know
what I'm talking about?

00:33:55.419 --> 00:34:01.210
She was on season five and we all underestimated
her because she was sort of quiet and she

00:34:01.210 --> 00:34:05.890
worked as a caterer, she wasn't as macho as
all the people who we thought had really you

00:34:05.890 --> 00:34:08.960
know strong stronger more aggressive personalities.

00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:14.710
She snuck up and made it to the finals to
the finale in her season and again in the

00:34:14.710 --> 00:34:16.139
All Star season.

00:34:16.139 --> 00:34:20.139
She is such a force and she has the most amazing
energy to her.

00:34:20.139 --> 00:34:22.119
I mean just being in a room with her makes
you smile.

00:34:22.119 --> 00:34:26.859
She's so much fun and now she's on the Chew
so I get to hang out with her a lot and she's

00:34:26.859 --> 00:34:27.859
just an amazing woman.

00:34:27.859 --> 00:34:28.989
I'm really proud of her.

00:34:28.989 --> 00:34:30.950
&gt;&gt;Frank Bruni: You mentioned the Chew, what
do you watch on TV?

00:34:30.950 --> 00:34:34.089
I mean do you, you said you didnít watch
reality before Top Chef.

00:34:34.089 --> 00:34:37.909
&gt;&gt;Gail Simmons: I donít, still I donít watch
a lot of food shows.

00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:41.490
I donít know if, you know there's certainly
some I watch.

00:34:41.490 --> 00:34:43.599
Like you know, on the Food Network I love
watching Alton Brown.

00:34:43.599 --> 00:34:47.529
I certainly watch Top Chef, cause I'm you
know, I have a mandate I gotta write a blog,

00:34:47.529 --> 00:34:49.239
I need to know what happens.

00:34:49.239 --> 00:34:52.959
Often I know, I was there but you donít know
all the other stuff so I have to watch that

00:34:52.959 --> 00:34:55.429
stuff to learn.

00:34:55.429 --> 00:34:57.129
What other shows do I watch?

00:34:57.129 --> 00:34:58.819
I watch Anthony Bourdain totally.

00:34:58.819 --> 00:35:02.420
I mean a lot a food travel channel stuff.

00:35:02.420 --> 00:35:05.900
Andrew Zimmerman is a good friend, he has
Bizarre Foods.

00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:12.040
And I think his show just gets better every
season, so I watch him a lot.

00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:15.660
And then I watch a lot of you know, non-reality
travel food stuff.

00:35:15.660 --> 00:35:20.519
I watch a lot of Friday Night Lights on Netflix,
right now season four.

00:35:20.519 --> 00:35:24.920
It's bad, I am decimated by what's going on
with Coach Taylor, but we're getting there.

00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:27.000
It's gonna get better, I can see bright days
ahead.

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:29.140
&gt;&gt;Frank Bruni: You mentioned travel just now.

00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:33.690
You mention it frequently in the book, where
have you had the best food in the world and

00:35:33.690 --> 00:35:34.739
where do you most long to go back to?

00:35:34.739 --> 00:35:35.739
&gt;&gt;Gail Simmons: Where-
&gt;&gt;Frank Bruni: To eat?

00:35:35.739 --> 00:35:38.660
&gt;&gt;Gail Simmons: - that's like the million
dollar question, Frank as you know.

00:35:38.660 --> 00:35:44.599
I mean I think actually to just preface it,
I think kinda the best thing about Top Chef,

00:35:44.599 --> 00:35:50.809
besides how much I love the contestants is
that really we travel for the show so much.

00:35:50.809 --> 00:35:54.829
You know we do every season in a new city
and then the finale of that season in another

00:35:54.829 --> 00:35:55.829
place as well.

00:35:55.829 --> 00:35:59.219
So not only do I get to travel to a lot of
cities that I've never spent time before.

00:35:59.219 --> 00:36:02.729
But we're there for you know about five or
six weeks now every time.

00:36:02.729 --> 00:36:07.089
So I get to actually really spend a lot of
time in cities I never spent a lot of time

00:36:07.089 --> 00:36:08.089
in before.

00:36:08.089 --> 00:36:09.359
I mean even Chicago, until we shot there.

00:36:09.359 --> 00:36:11.700
&gt;&gt;Frank Bruni: Even though you grew up in
Toronto?

00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:15.539
&gt;&gt;Gail Simmons: Yeah, it's amazing because
they're pretty similar, they're very close

00:36:15.539 --> 00:36:17.450
but I just never had the occasion to go.

00:36:17.450 --> 00:36:21.529
I mean of all cities in the States I think
right now, Chicago, the food of Chicago the

00:36:21.529 --> 00:36:25.559
chefs of Chicago there's a energy there that
I'm really amazed by and impressed with every

00:36:25.559 --> 00:36:26.790
time I'm there now.

00:36:26.790 --> 00:36:33.140
New Orleans is another kinda US city that
blows me away, food culturally.

00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:39.130
On a greater kind of world level, we got to
go to Singapore two seasons ago for our finale.

00:36:39.130 --> 00:36:43.539
I took a little detour and went to Indonesia
and that was pretty exciting from a food prospective.

00:36:43.539 --> 00:36:48.039
But Singapore itself, Singapore's sort of
a bizarre place I found.

00:36:48.039 --> 00:36:53.060
Because culturally it's such a modern city,
you donít see a lot of the history.

00:36:53.060 --> 00:36:58.440
They sort of built sky scrapers to cover up
a lot of the history of that part of the world.

00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:06.660
The food and the multicultural sort of like
mix has created this extraordinary, very unique

00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:11.460
place to eat and the food culture in Singapore
is kind of unlike anything I've ever had.

00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:16.599
From the street stalls I mean you literally
everyone, from high powered executive to you

00:37:16.599 --> 00:37:19.839
know any level, you eat on the street.

00:37:19.839 --> 00:37:22.709
It has the strongest best street food I've
ever had.

00:37:22.709 --> 00:37:26.279
And then it has kind of you know, some of
the best restaurants in the world, all in

00:37:26.279 --> 00:37:27.690
one.

00:37:27.690 --> 00:37:35.930
You know I could go to Paris forever, I mean
who couldn't eat tarts in Paris for the rest

00:37:35.930 --> 00:37:37.489
of their life?

00:37:37.489 --> 00:37:41.119
Where else have I really been excited by eating?

00:37:41.119 --> 00:37:42.140
&gt;&gt;Frank Bruni: What about here in New York?

00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:43.140
Where do-

00:37:43.140 --> 00:37:44.140
&gt;&gt;Gail Simmons: Yeah.

00:37:44.140 --> 00:37:45.140
&gt;&gt;Frank Bruni: -find yourself going most often?

00:37:45.140 --> 00:37:46.140
&gt;&gt;Gail Simmons: Oh my God.

00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:49.960
You know I eat so much out in New York for
my job, to sort of keep up with things and

00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:53.339
it's hard to sort of go back to the same place
twice but then there's, there are I mean right

00:37:53.339 --> 00:37:57.290
now there's a lot of restaurants I'm really
excited about in New York.

00:37:57.290 --> 00:38:04.910
I'm excited about new, sort of semi new I
think people who do sort of really interesting

00:38:04.910 --> 00:38:05.910
things.

00:38:05.910 --> 00:38:12.549
Restaurants like Aldea right on 17th St here,
George Mendez is a young chef who is Portuguese

00:38:12.549 --> 00:38:18.130
and he's, there aren't a lot of really high
end sort of Portuguese restaurants right now,

00:38:18.130 --> 00:38:21.469
I really can't think of that many at all in
New York.

00:38:21.469 --> 00:38:25.680
I think that he-- people think that Portuguese
food is just kind of like Spanish food and

00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:30.509
it's not, it's really interesting and I think
he just does a beautiful job.

00:38:30.509 --> 00:38:34.400
I'm excited about kind of a lot of local small
places.

00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:37.749
I'm excited about Parm, in Nolita, Terrizzi's,
those guys.

00:38:37.749 --> 00:38:43.119
I actually wrote, the great thing about working
for Daniel Boulud was that he has a pretty

00:38:43.119 --> 00:38:47.969
big empire of restaurants and when I was working
there, you know he has a lot of young people

00:38:47.969 --> 00:38:49.529
working for him, a lot of young chefs.

00:38:49.529 --> 00:38:53.829
Because it's a young persons job in a lot
of ways and so, I worked, when I worked with

00:38:53.829 --> 00:38:59.960
Daniel in kind of 2002, 3, 4, we had this
kind of crew of young people that worked for

00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:01.109
him.

00:39:01.109 --> 00:39:04.520
Young chefs in front of the house and me in
marketing, special event people.

00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:08.950
And we all really stuck together and became
really good friends and now we've all gone

00:39:08.950 --> 00:39:11.569
out and done all different things.

00:39:11.569 --> 00:39:18.180
So there's this sort of weird amazing octopus
arms that Daniel has of the next generation

00:39:18.180 --> 00:39:19.709
of people who are doing really great things.

00:39:19.709 --> 00:39:21.589
and Rich from Terrizzi's is one of them.

00:39:21.589 --> 00:39:28.009
Andrew Carmellini is another, Andrew was Daniel's
chef de cuisine at CafÈ Boulud for I dunno

00:39:28.009 --> 00:39:29.140
8 years or something.

00:39:29.140 --> 00:39:34.480
And now he has Locanda Verde and The Dutch
and I think he's just doing such a great job.

00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:37.480
And he's sort of you know, in his own way
a mentor of mine.

00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:40.030
I'm really excited about how well he's done.

00:39:40.030 --> 00:39:46.670
I dunno, I feel like there's getting to be
really good barbeque in New York which excites

00:39:46.670 --> 00:39:47.670
me.

00:39:47.670 --> 00:39:50.999
I spent the summer in Texas, so I got to eat
a lot of barbeque.

00:39:50.999 --> 00:39:53.529
I like that New York is getting better at
it.

00:39:53.529 --> 00:39:57.970
&gt;&gt;Frank Bruni: When you said earlier live
television is hard, what do you think those

00:39:57.970 --> 00:40:01.059
of us who are just watching it but donít
do it, what donít we appreciate?

00:40:01.059 --> 00:40:04.599
What's the peculiar skill that's difficult
and hard there?

00:40:04.599 --> 00:40:08.230
&gt;&gt;Gail Simmons: You know a couple things one
timing, I mean when you're doing live television,

00:40:08.230 --> 00:40:10.349
I mean obviously Top Chef isn't live.

00:40:10.349 --> 00:40:14.249
We did one live finale on Top Chef, for season
three.

00:40:14.249 --> 00:40:20.299
And it was sort of an experiment and it was
way harder than what we do every day.

00:40:20.299 --> 00:40:24.390
I mean when we film Top Chef you know we can
sit and talk for 7 hours and it gets edited

00:40:24.390 --> 00:40:28.089
down to 15 minutes.

00:40:28.089 --> 00:40:32.779
Live television in itself, like I just did
the Today Show this morning and timing is

00:40:32.779 --> 00:40:35.199
such a crazy factor, in live television.

00:40:35.199 --> 00:40:41.479
Things have to move so quickly and you have
no sense of how that timing works.

00:40:41.479 --> 00:40:43.960
So that always is very nerve wracking.

00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:49.630
Combined with the way we speak umm, there
it is I just said umm.

00:40:49.630 --> 00:40:54.979
When I did media training the one thing that
they taught me about more than anything else

00:40:54.979 --> 00:40:57.749
was learning to listen to yourself speak.

00:40:57.749 --> 00:41:02.680
We use a lot of words in every day conversation
that on live television just don't work out

00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:03.680
very well.

00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:06.089
They donít mean anything to your audience.

00:41:06.089 --> 00:41:09.539
Words like delicious and amazing.

00:41:09.539 --> 00:41:13.769
Words that are kind of descriptive words but
donít really tell you anything about the

00:41:13.769 --> 00:41:14.769
food.

00:41:14.769 --> 00:41:18.469
I can tell you something that, I can tell
you that something is delicious I know that

00:41:18.469 --> 00:41:23.039
you know that that means that I liked it but,
what does that tell you about what it tasted

00:41:23.039 --> 00:41:24.039
like?

00:41:24.039 --> 00:41:25.039
Not much.

00:41:25.039 --> 00:41:26.039
Was it gooey?

00:41:26.039 --> 00:41:27.039
Was it chocolately?

00:41:27.039 --> 00:41:28.039
Was it rich?

00:41:28.039 --> 00:41:29.039
Was it light?

00:41:29.039 --> 00:41:30.039
Was it fright?

00:41:30.039 --> 00:41:31.039
Was it bright?

00:41:31.039 --> 00:41:32.039
Was it fresh?

00:41:32.039 --> 00:41:33.039
Was it acidic?

00:41:33.039 --> 00:41:34.039
Was it spicy?

00:41:34.039 --> 00:41:35.039
Delicious tells me nothing.

00:41:35.039 --> 00:41:36.199
So it's about eliminating a lot of those words
from your vocabulary.

00:41:36.199 --> 00:41:40.950
When you have two and a half minutes to get
through three recipes on television that was

00:41:40.950 --> 00:41:43.609
kind of the biggest learning curve, for me
for sure.

00:41:43.609 --> 00:41:47.660
&gt;&gt;Frank Bruni: You also make the point in
the book that eating is so subjective, that

00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:48.809
taste is subjective ñ

00:41:48.809 --> 00:41:49.809
&gt;&gt;Gail Simmons: Yes.

00:41:49.809 --> 00:41:54.079
&gt;&gt;Frank Bruni: Given that, how can one come
to conclusions on a show like Top Chef?

00:41:54.079 --> 00:41:56.819
Is it just the aggregate of everybody's subjectivity
or?

00:41:56.819 --> 00:42:01.440
&gt;&gt;Gail Simmons: You know it, a little bit
but it's certainly the question I get asked

00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:02.440
a lot.

00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:03.440
How do you, first of all how do you judge?

00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:05.589
Like who the hell are you to judge?

00:42:05.589 --> 00:42:07.089
That's the first question.

00:42:07.089 --> 00:42:09.579
But, which I talk about a lot in the book.

00:42:09.579 --> 00:42:17.309
But even more so how does one esoterically,
how do you judge food when food is so much

00:42:17.309 --> 00:42:21.599
about personal taste?

00:42:21.599 --> 00:42:27.940
I would argue that judging food on a macro
level isnít about personal taste, not at

00:42:27.940 --> 00:42:28.940
all.

00:42:28.940 --> 00:42:34.920
But I would say only about 20% of the judging
experience is about personal taste, for me.

00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:41.059
Eighty percent of it is science, cooking is
chemistry more than anything else.

00:42:41.059 --> 00:42:46.660
Yes, there are certain foods that I donít
like and a lot of food that I love, you know

00:42:46.660 --> 00:42:48.089
a lot of flavors that I love.

00:42:48.089 --> 00:42:53.539
But that is not how I personally have learned
to judge food.

00:42:53.539 --> 00:42:58.829
Because I went to culinary school and I learned
science of cooking, not that everyone has

00:42:58.829 --> 00:43:02.410
to go to culinary school, you really just
have to eat a lot and pay attention to what

00:43:02.410 --> 00:43:03.499
you're eating.

00:43:03.499 --> 00:43:07.469
But you know, you learn to understand when
someone says that you're supposed to cook

00:43:07.469 --> 00:43:11.979
a steak medium rare, the chef suggests you
cook it, you eat it medium rare.

00:43:11.979 --> 00:43:16.039
That doesnít mean you have to like medium
rare but there's a reason that a certain cut

00:43:16.039 --> 00:43:22.050
of meat a strip loin for example, a New York
strip should be cooked to medium rare because

00:43:22.050 --> 00:43:26.900
that cut of meat, scientifically that is the
best way to cook it to that exact temperature

00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:31.660
and there is a degree of doneness that will
bring out that best flavor and texture qualities

00:43:31.660 --> 00:43:33.979
of that piece of meat.

00:43:33.979 --> 00:43:36.729
And knife skills come into play.

00:43:36.729 --> 00:43:40.680
When you have great knife skills and you cut
food properly, when you cut it, let's say

00:43:40.680 --> 00:43:43.500
you're cutting a bunch of carrots to cook
in your dish.

00:43:43.500 --> 00:43:47.359
You want to cut your carrots consistently
to the exact same size so that every piece

00:43:47.359 --> 00:43:50.259
is the same so that they'll cook at a consistent
level.

00:43:50.259 --> 00:43:54.141
So that they're all cooked to the same doneness,
cause if one piece is really big and one piece

00:43:54.141 --> 00:43:57.329
is really small, the small piece is going
to cook more than the big, you know quicker

00:43:57.329 --> 00:44:00.519
than the big piece and then when you eat it
one piece will be crunchy and one piece will

00:44:00.519 --> 00:44:02.390
be soft or overcooked.

00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:12.989
So it's really science it's about the reaction
of protein and heat or sugar and heat, caramelization.

00:44:12.989 --> 00:44:18.059
So when you learn how to think about how food
should be cooked to its optimum levels, you

00:44:18.059 --> 00:44:21.190
look at a plate a little bit differently and
it becomes actually very objective.

00:44:21.190 --> 00:44:24.809
I'm kind of rambling I'm probably not making
much sense anymore.

00:44:24.809 --> 00:44:28.249
Then obviously the flavor combination thing
comes into effect.

00:44:28.249 --> 00:44:29.890
Do I like this?

00:44:29.890 --> 00:44:32.089
You know, some of it is about does it taste
good together?

00:44:32.089 --> 00:44:37.660
But a lot of it also is about understanding
why flavors taste good together.

00:44:37.660 --> 00:44:40.680
There needs to be balance there needs to be
harmony.

00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:43.219
When you eat a piece of food, why does it
taste good?

00:44:43.219 --> 00:44:49.069
Because it has richness and it has a bit of
acid that cuts the richness or it has you

00:44:49.069 --> 00:44:56.309
know, an umami flavor a saltiness a sweetness,
all those tastes buds are there for a reason

00:44:56.309 --> 00:44:58.410
and you want balance and that's what makes
food appealing.

00:44:58.410 --> 00:45:03.739
So it's sort of learning that about food that
makes me understand how to judge it a little

00:45:03.739 --> 00:45:04.739
better.

00:45:04.739 --> 00:45:06.130
&gt;&gt;Frank Bruni: I want to ask you one more
question but then I also want to point out

00:45:06.130 --> 00:45:09.809
that there are microphones there and there
and since there are a lot of people here weíll

00:45:09.809 --> 00:45:10.809
give them a chance to-

00:45:10.809 --> 00:45:11.809
&gt;&gt;Gail Simmons: Yeah.

00:45:11.809 --> 00:45:12.809
&gt;&gt;Frank Bruni: -ask you whatever they want.

00:45:12.809 --> 00:45:13.809
&gt;&gt;Gail Simmons: Sure.

00:45:13.809 --> 00:45:17.059
&gt;&gt;Frank Bruni: So, anyone who's got a question,
think about it and maybe get to a microphone.

00:45:17.059 --> 00:45:18.059
Top Chef Desserts-

00:45:18.059 --> 00:45:19.059
&gt;&gt;Gail Simmons: Yes.

00:45:19.059 --> 00:45:21.719
&gt;&gt;Frank Bruni: How does the production the
putting together of that differ ñ I think

00:45:21.719 --> 00:45:22.819
of dessert making-

00:45:22.819 --> 00:45:23.819
&gt;&gt;Gail Simmons: Right.

00:45:23.819 --> 00:45:27.130
&gt;&gt;Frank Bruni: -as involving a lot more equipment,
often it can be much more technical it can

00:45:27.130 --> 00:45:29.349
be much- there a much more theatrical-

00:45:29.349 --> 00:45:30.349
&gt;&gt;Gail Simmons: Yes.

00:45:30.349 --> 00:45:31.349
&gt;&gt;Frank Bruni: -element to it.

00:45:31.349 --> 00:45:32.349
Is it a harder show to pull off?

00:45:32.349 --> 00:45:34.630
What kind of tweaks did you have to make to
have that work?

00:45:34.630 --> 00:45:38.480
&gt;&gt;Gail Simmons: I think Top Chef Desserts
is a harder show to pull off.

00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:41.749
I mean they're on different, they're obviously
slightly different.

00:45:41.749 --> 00:45:45.140
When we first started shooting Top Chef Just
Desserts, which we've now done two seasons,

00:45:45.140 --> 00:45:48.319
it was a spin-off of the original, but for
pastry.

00:45:48.319 --> 00:45:53.910
I think we all thought that it would just
be Top Chef but with a few more ovens and

00:45:53.910 --> 00:45:54.910
a lot more sugar.

00:45:54.910 --> 00:46:00.849
But we realized really quickly was that baking
pastry, the making of pastry at the professional

00:46:00.849 --> 00:46:05.880
level, is actually a totally different science.

00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:11.319
Much more intricate, much more complex in
that when you make a cake, there's no tasting

00:46:11.319 --> 00:46:14.799
as you go, there's no throwing in a little
of this and a little bit of that.

00:46:14.799 --> 00:46:20.000
There's also bake time required and then once
it's baked it needs to be cooled and iced

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:25.140
and sliced and plated and so the whole process
of baking desserts and making desserts is

00:46:25.140 --> 00:46:28.449
really really different.

00:46:28.449 --> 00:46:33.779
So we had to account for that which we sort
of thought about later in the process which

00:46:33.779 --> 00:46:36.630
made for some really interesting challenges.

00:46:36.630 --> 00:46:40.859
But it really is and the personality of a
pastry chef is really different because of

00:46:40.859 --> 00:46:41.859
it.

00:46:41.859 --> 00:46:44.569
Their job is much more scientific to the microgram.

00:46:44.569 --> 00:46:48.400
You know when make a recipe, when you're making
if you know how to make a stew you can make

00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:52.220
50 stews and you could throw a little of your
leftover this and a little bit of onion and

00:46:52.220 --> 00:46:55.109
then you could put in some tomatoes or if
you want you can leave out the tomatoes, put

00:46:55.109 --> 00:46:56.109
in some carrots.

00:46:56.109 --> 00:46:59.410
It doesn't work like that when you cook a
recipe, when you making that cake you need

00:46:59.410 --> 00:47:04.420
an exact ratio of flour to sugar to egg or
to fat.

00:47:04.420 --> 00:47:09.510
You know, the gluten content needs to be in
exact balance with the baking powder and the

00:47:09.510 --> 00:47:12.809
baking soda so that it will rise properly.

00:47:12.809 --> 00:47:18.290
And all of this, if it's out of whack by even
a gram or so will ruin the process.

00:47:18.290 --> 00:47:26.130
So in my experience, pastry chefs are a lot
more meticulous, a lot more exacting which

00:47:26.130 --> 00:47:27.709
allows us to do a lot too.

00:47:27.709 --> 00:47:32.359
Because I also think that desserts are a lot
more beautiful, visually, for our audience.

00:47:32.359 --> 00:47:36.849
And the work you can do with chocolate and
sugar is sort of extraordinary if you really

00:47:36.849 --> 00:47:38.329
have chefs at that level.

00:47:38.329 --> 00:47:42.890
So it was an exciting show to make but a huge
learning curve for me, for sure.

00:47:42.890 --> 00:47:43.890
Hi.

00:47:43.890 --> 00:47:46.009
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #1: Hi, how are you
doing?

00:47:46.009 --> 00:47:47.009
Thanks for coming.

00:47:47.009 --> 00:47:48.200
&gt;&gt;Gail Simmons: Thank you.

00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:52.670
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #1: I'd say that there's
a lot of consensus at the Top Chef judges

00:47:52.670 --> 00:47:56.359
table probably driven by that 80% of objectivity
you were talking about.

00:47:56.359 --> 00:47:57.359
&gt;&gt;Gail Simmons: Right.

00:47:57.359 --> 00:47:59.890
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #1: Well what do you
think is your sort of unique perspective that

00:47:59.890 --> 00:48:03.670
you bring when you're talking about you know
what you think is the best or what you think

00:48:03.670 --> 00:48:05.609
is the worst compared to Tom or Padma?

00:48:05.609 --> 00:48:07.539
&gt;&gt;Gail Simmons: That's a great question.

00:48:07.539 --> 00:48:08.539
There is and there isn't.

00:48:08.539 --> 00:48:12.329
Yes there mostly is consensus because I do
think we're all sort of now looking for similar

00:48:12.329 --> 00:48:14.059
things but not always.

00:48:14.059 --> 00:48:19.410
They love when we fight; it's my producers'
favorite thing in the world.

00:48:19.410 --> 00:48:21.999
And it definitely happens.

00:48:21.999 --> 00:48:26.470
I do think though that we all have taken on
different roles and that also is why it works.

00:48:26.470 --> 00:48:30.630
Because we're looking for different things
and we bring to the table different things.

00:48:30.630 --> 00:48:37.280
I like to think that our roles are sort of
like this: so Tom is the chef of the kitchen,

00:48:37.280 --> 00:48:41.079
when he does that walk through in the kitchen,
it's as if he's the chef walking through his

00:48:41.079 --> 00:48:45.069
own line right before a really busy service
and he's looking at the cooks and making sure

00:48:45.069 --> 00:48:47.589
they're ready and testing them.

00:48:47.589 --> 00:48:48.589
Are you ready?

00:48:48.589 --> 00:48:49.589
Did you think of this?

00:48:49.589 --> 00:48:50.589
Are you sure you want to do that?

00:48:50.589 --> 00:48:53.549
Then he comes out and tastes the food, and
when he tastes it in his mind, and this is

00:48:53.549 --> 00:48:59.890
my opinion of him, I havenít asked him if
this is right or not, but you know he tastes

00:48:59.890 --> 00:49:05.430
the food and he thinks "Is this food cooked
to the quality of what I would want in my

00:49:05.430 --> 00:49:06.430
kitchen?

00:49:06.430 --> 00:49:12.449
If I, if someone, if a cook in my restaurant
cooked this would I praise them or would I

00:49:12.449 --> 00:49:15.059
make them wash dishes or fire them?"

00:49:15.059 --> 00:49:21.470
He comes with a very technical a very specific
sort of outlook about, from a very sort of

00:49:21.470 --> 00:49:22.949
cheffy stand point.

00:49:22.949 --> 00:49:28.529
He's there to be the chef of the kitchen and
to bring to our table his standards.

00:49:28.529 --> 00:49:34.480
Obviously he's very successful with the extraordinary
empire of restaurants that he's been cooking,

00:49:34.480 --> 00:49:36.390
he's been cooking for 25 years.

00:49:36.390 --> 00:49:40.120
At the time, this is an aside, but the time
that he got his first 3 star review in the

00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:43.450
New York Times he was like the youngest chef
I think in history to do so.

00:49:43.450 --> 00:49:48.799
He was like 26 or 27 years old at Mondrian,
I feel like I know his bio way too well.

00:49:48.799 --> 00:49:51.270
We spend a lot of time together.

00:49:51.270 --> 00:49:52.630
So that's kind of his perspective.

00:49:52.630 --> 00:49:56.490
My perspective I always say, I 'm sort of
the, I'm the food critic.

00:49:56.490 --> 00:50:00.579
I am coming to the restaurant as an educated
diner.

00:50:00.579 --> 00:50:03.229
I'm the restaurant reviewer for that matter.

00:50:03.229 --> 00:50:05.920
I have training, I do it for a living, it's
my profession.

00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:09.539
I've been doing it for 15 years.

00:50:09.539 --> 00:50:15.859
And if I were to eat this meal, how would
I rate it if I was writing a review or if

00:50:15.859 --> 00:50:18.999
I was recommending it in Food &amp; Wine magazine?

00:50:18.999 --> 00:50:20.359
Would I recommend it?

00:50:20.359 --> 00:50:22.680
Would I tell everyone at home about it?

00:50:22.680 --> 00:50:24.719
Did I have a great experience?

00:50:24.719 --> 00:50:27.099
Because if I did I want to write about it
and I want to praise it.

00:50:27.099 --> 00:50:31.519
If I didn't, I'm never going back to the restaurant
and I'm gonna tell people I know that they

00:50:31.519 --> 00:50:32.640
shouldnít go either.

00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:35.079
And that's also why every meal counts, by
the way.

00:50:35.079 --> 00:50:40.130
Thatís why we can't ever judge people on
how good they did cumulatively.

00:50:40.130 --> 00:50:44.189
It needs to be based on that exact dish.

00:50:44.189 --> 00:50:46.339
And that dish only, every challenge.

00:50:46.339 --> 00:50:49.209
Because you can't say well they were really
good yesterday but today they're not so good

00:50:49.209 --> 00:50:52.469
but they were great yesterday so we'll let
them go because if you go to a restaurant

00:50:52.469 --> 00:50:57.779
and you have a bad meal, you donít care if
the chef's wife left him the next day or that

00:50:57.779 --> 00:51:00.999
they woke up on the wrong side of the bed,
you donít know what goes on in the kitchen

00:51:00.999 --> 00:51:02.059
and you donít care.

00:51:02.059 --> 00:51:04.609
You just want your dish to be great.

00:51:04.609 --> 00:51:06.500
So that's how I think of the food.

00:51:06.500 --> 00:51:08.430
Padma's role I think is a number of things.

00:51:08.430 --> 00:51:13.640
A: she's the hostess, she greats you, she
draws you in makes you comfortable, gets you

00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:17.180
talking as the diner and you know as the chef.

00:51:17.180 --> 00:51:20.940
Making sure that you have what you need to
give us the best experience you can.

00:51:20.940 --> 00:51:25.029
She's also sort of the enthusiastic diner,
she doesnít have a professional training

00:51:25.029 --> 00:51:26.670
but she loves to eat.

00:51:26.670 --> 00:51:28.280
She's eaten a lot all over the world.

00:51:28.280 --> 00:51:31.299
And yes, she eats despite what people might
think.

00:51:31.299 --> 00:51:34.440
She does have that body, but I've also seen
her pack it in.

00:51:34.440 --> 00:51:35.519
[audience laughter]

00:51:35.519 --> 00:51:40.619
&gt;&gt;Gail Simmons: And you know, and so she's
sort of like, you know, the viewer.

00:51:40.619 --> 00:51:45.759
She's the person who wants to eat great food,
is looking for a great experience.

00:51:45.759 --> 00:51:49.390
And if she's gonna spend her money on a great
meal, was this meal worth it?

00:51:49.390 --> 00:51:55.269
My hard earned dollars as just the every person
who wants to go out and eat a great dinner.

00:51:55.269 --> 00:51:56.269
So that ñ

00:51:56.269 --> 00:51:57.269
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #1: Yes.

00:51:57.269 --> 00:51:58.269
&gt;&gt;Gail Simmons: - thatís sort how I think
of us.

00:51:58.269 --> 00:52:00.239
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #1: What's the last
big fight you guys had?

00:52:00.239 --> 00:52:03.920
&gt;&gt;Gail Simmons: Oh this finale, which hasnít
aired yet.

00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:10.119
We just shot it in Vancouver in January which
was a cruel joke because p.s. we also shot

00:52:10.119 --> 00:52:12.309
the season in Texas in July.

00:52:12.309 --> 00:52:13.609
So someone is after us.

00:52:13.609 --> 00:52:18.240
It was the hottest summer on record in 60
years in Texas and it was like one of the

00:52:18.240 --> 00:52:24.019
coldest days ever in Vancouver when we shot
it was like I think 18 degrees?

00:52:24.019 --> 00:52:26.050
So yeah, we argued a lot.

00:52:26.050 --> 00:52:31.339
I mean I think we finished shooting the finale,
the final final episode at 5 in the morning.

00:52:31.339 --> 00:52:36.099
Cause we just couldn't agree at all, which
also often happens actually.

00:52:36.099 --> 00:52:40.069
It's not rare that we have finished our finale
at 5, 6, 7 o'clock in the morning.

00:52:40.069 --> 00:52:44.769
Weíve seen the sunrise I would say, on, of
the 9 finales we've shot, I would say on 5

00:52:44.769 --> 00:52:51.559
of 9 of them we have seen the birds chirp
because we, you know, we wanna make sure we've

00:52:51.559 --> 00:52:53.160
made the right decision.

00:52:53.160 --> 00:52:54.160
Hi.

00:52:54.160 --> 00:52:55.640
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #1: Hi.

00:52:55.640 --> 00:52:59.609
How do you think the rise of Top Chef and
other contemporary reality food in television

00:52:59.609 --> 00:53:01.299
has affected food writing?

00:53:01.299 --> 00:53:07.130
&gt;&gt;Gail Simmons: You know, it's a tricky question
and I do address this a bit in the book, as

00:53:07.130 --> 00:53:11.249
I said when I first wanted to be a food writer,
when I first graduated school and wanted to

00:53:11.249 --> 00:53:15.819
work in food media, food media was so so different
than it is now.

00:53:15.819 --> 00:53:21.359
There weren't blogs, there weren't like, there
weren't even that many food websites at least

00:53:21.359 --> 00:53:23.079
that we knew, it was just all starting.

00:53:23.079 --> 00:53:26.170
It was really in its infancy, there certainly
wasn't Twitter, there wasn't Facebook, there

00:53:26.170 --> 00:53:29.769
wasn't Google+, I'm a fan of Google+ I'm on
Google+.

00:53:29.769 --> 00:53:30.769
[audience laughter]

00:53:30.769 --> 00:53:33.229
&gt;&gt;Gail Simmons: Thank you Zagat.

00:53:33.229 --> 00:53:40.029
But I you know, so I think that it all has
been one big conversation and I think food

00:53:40.029 --> 00:53:44.019
reality competitions have been a big part
of that.

00:53:44.019 --> 00:53:49.869
I'd like to think as much as sometimes all
of the tweeting and blogging and can sometimes

00:53:49.869 --> 00:53:56.089
be distracting and cruel and gossipy, you
know, I think that people don't realize how

00:53:56.089 --> 00:53:59.969
much power they wield when they write disparaging
things.

00:53:59.969 --> 00:54:05.039
I do think that all of it together, the food
shows and social media have created a climate

00:54:05.039 --> 00:54:07.420
that has made us all a lot smarter.

00:54:07.420 --> 00:54:10.309
A lot more educated.

00:54:10.309 --> 00:54:14.339
There's no greater compliment for me when
people come up to me, strangers on the street

00:54:14.339 --> 00:54:17.859
and tell me that they watch Top Chef with
their children and then they help, their children

00:54:17.859 --> 00:54:19.209
help them cook dinner.

00:54:19.209 --> 00:54:26.609
Or when they go out to eat and they now read
the menu differently and last night they went

00:54:26.609 --> 00:54:30.020
to a restaurant and they tried sweet breads
for the first time because they'd seen us

00:54:30.020 --> 00:54:31.930
cook it on the show.

00:54:31.930 --> 00:54:37.089
I think a truck is about to drive through
the stage, just let me know.

00:54:37.089 --> 00:54:38.089
[audience laughter]

00:54:38.089 --> 00:54:42.160
&gt;&gt;Gail Simmons: But you know, I think that
we, I think that Top Chef certainly and all

00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:49.969
of the kinda food television have, have changed
the conversation, have enhanced the dialogue

00:54:49.969 --> 00:54:51.019
that we can all now have.

00:54:51.019 --> 00:54:57.739
It's not just a monologue where as it used
to be just restaurant critics you know, who

00:54:57.739 --> 00:55:01.549
would write a review and it's all anonymous,
and that's still very important and I donít

00:55:01.549 --> 00:55:05.259
think that their power has changed and their
importance have changed, but I definitely

00:55:05.259 --> 00:55:09.179
think that now it's become, because of Top
Chef and because of social media it's all

00:55:09.179 --> 00:55:12.229
become a greater conversation that everyone
can participate in.

00:55:12.229 --> 00:55:15.959
And have knowledge of a little more.

00:55:15.959 --> 00:55:18.309
I think it's all good, is the end result.

00:55:18.309 --> 00:55:19.940
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #2: Hi.

00:55:19.940 --> 00:55:20.940
&gt;&gt;Gail Simmons: Hi.

00:55:20.940 --> 00:55:25.339
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #2: So with all your
years of experience and writing and eating,

00:55:25.339 --> 00:55:28.390
I'm sure you're probably very adventuresome
in your eating.

00:55:28.390 --> 00:55:33.040
Is there anything that you absolutely wouldnít
eat or have had a hard time stomaching?

00:55:33.040 --> 00:55:42.349
&gt;&gt;Gail Simmons: There is nothing I wouldn't
eat to date but that could change, so who

00:55:42.349 --> 00:55:43.349
knows.

00:55:43.349 --> 00:55:46.819
There's nothing I won't try, there's nothing
I won't taste.

00:55:46.819 --> 00:55:52.859
I donít like to eat for sport, you know I
donít like to eat just for the sake of eating,

00:55:52.859 --> 00:56:00.099
you know, I dunno like some random thing just
for the sake of doing it?

00:56:00.099 --> 00:56:05.589
But if it's cooked for me with love and attention
and for a purpose, there's nothing I won't

00:56:05.589 --> 00:56:06.670
try.

00:56:06.670 --> 00:56:10.819
There are certainly things I donít like to
eat, that I'd prefer not to like, I mean there's

00:56:10.819 --> 00:56:13.930
no denying there's a level of subjectivity
to how we all, right?

00:56:13.930 --> 00:56:16.049
There are certainly things I'd prefer to eat.

00:56:16.049 --> 00:56:22.650
Some days I crave hamburgers, some days you
know, I'd prefer not to eat whatever it is,

00:56:22.650 --> 00:56:23.709
green pepper.

00:56:23.709 --> 00:56:29.009
But and there are certainly things that, everyone
I think all of us have a little bit of sort

00:56:29.009 --> 00:56:34.250
of irrational food likes and dislikes, personal
preferences.

00:56:34.250 --> 00:56:37.579
So I certainly have a few of those.

00:56:37.579 --> 00:56:44.539
I have this weird thing about black beans
and it's sort of this drawn out, totally irrational

00:56:44.539 --> 00:56:45.539
story.

00:56:45.539 --> 00:56:48.759
And I admit that it's irrational, no offense
to black beans and the Black Bean Association

00:56:48.759 --> 00:56:50.539
of America.

00:56:50.539 --> 00:56:56.220
It's just a personal aversion, I had a bad
experience, I donít want to eat black beans.

00:56:56.220 --> 00:57:00.109
That said, if black beans are served to me
on the show or if I'm at someone's house and

00:57:00.109 --> 00:57:07.410
they make something with black beans I will
always always taste it.

00:57:07.410 --> 00:57:10.949
And sometimes even like it, I'll just never
make it for myself.

00:57:10.949 --> 00:57:19.529
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #2: Hi, I once had
to judge a sort of Top Chef like cooking competition

00:57:19.529 --> 00:57:20.529
here at Google.

00:57:20.529 --> 00:57:21.529
&gt;&gt;Gail Simmons: Right.

00:57:21.529 --> 00:57:22.949
I've judged a Google like Top Chef-

00:57:22.949 --> 00:57:24.150
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #2: Yeah.

00:57:24.150 --> 00:57:25.359
&gt;&gt;Gail Simmons: -Christmas charity cooking
thing.

00:57:25.359 --> 00:57:26.920
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #2: That was a much
bigger deal than what I-

00:57:26.920 --> 00:57:28.459
&gt;&gt;Gail Simmons: So still, we're doing the
same thing.

00:57:28.459 --> 00:57:29.459
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #2: Yeah.

00:57:29.459 --> 00:57:31.710
But it is surprisingly difficult.

00:57:31.710 --> 00:57:35.829
Like I guess coming into it I like I guess
I didnít really understand the skill that's

00:57:35.829 --> 00:57:36.829
actually involved-

00:57:36.829 --> 00:57:37.829
&gt;&gt;Gail Simmons: Right.

00:57:37.829 --> 00:57:40.179
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #2: - in, because you're
taking, you're tasting a lot of dishes and

00:57:40.179 --> 00:57:41.179
they're all pretty good.

00:57:41.179 --> 00:57:42.179
&gt;&gt;Gail Simmons: Yes.

00:57:42.179 --> 00:57:43.179
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #2: Right?

00:57:43.179 --> 00:57:44.179
&gt;&gt;Gail Simmons: Yes.

00:57:44.179 --> 00:57:45.179
That's exactly-

00:57:45.179 --> 00:57:46.179
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #2: But they all taste
like but-

00:57:46.179 --> 00:57:47.179
&gt;&gt;Gail Simmons: A similar-
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #2: It's not like they're

00:57:47.179 --> 00:57:48.179
the same dishes, right?

00:57:48.179 --> 00:57:49.179
&gt;&gt;Gail Simmons: Right.

00:57:49.179 --> 00:57:50.179
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #2: It's like all the
same dishes, you might be able to tell one's

00:57:50.179 --> 00:57:51.179
better than the other.

00:57:51.179 --> 00:57:55.779
But when they're different dishes, it's really
hard to kind of decide which one you, is actually

00:57:55.779 --> 00:57:56.779
better.

00:57:56.779 --> 00:57:59.369
What are your tips on kind of doing that sort
of thing?

00:57:59.369 --> 00:58:03.339
&gt;&gt;Gail Simmons: You know we talk about this
a lot of the show specifically because what

00:58:03.339 --> 00:58:09.569
we think the audience can't see and people
get mad at us when we criticize little, little

00:58:09.569 --> 00:58:10.829
mistakes that people made.

00:58:10.829 --> 00:58:15.170
But what they donít understand is that when
you have 10 dishes and they're all good, how

00:58:15.170 --> 00:58:17.079
do you differentiate between them?

00:58:17.079 --> 00:58:22.249
Because also at this level on the show specifically,
they're all professional chefs, it's mostly

00:58:22.249 --> 00:58:23.249
all good.

00:58:23.249 --> 00:58:26.499
There were days, early days, when the food
was really bad on Top Chef.

00:58:26.499 --> 00:58:30.280
I'm trying to think of, Frank judged with
us once and I'm trying to remember how the

00:58:30.280 --> 00:58:31.280
food was that time.

00:58:31.280 --> 00:58:32.539
Do you remember if it was good?

00:58:32.539 --> 00:58:33.539
&gt;&gt;Frank Bruni: Oh yeah there was some really
bad food.

00:58:33.539 --> 00:58:34.539
&gt;&gt;Gail Simmons: It happens.

00:58:34.539 --> 00:58:35.539
[audience laughter]

00:58:35.539 --> 00:58:36.539
&gt;&gt;Gail Simmons: It definitely happens.

00:58:36.539 --> 00:58:39.349
But we're getting better and especially near
the end of a season and there's only 3 or

00:58:39.349 --> 00:58:43.509
4 people left, they're the best people and
sometimes it's all really good.

00:58:43.509 --> 00:58:46.789
Sometimes it's really obvious and there's
bad stuff, but more times than not it's good.

00:58:46.789 --> 00:58:50.339
Or at least there's a few that are really
good and then you have to still pick a winner.

00:58:50.339 --> 00:58:53.599
Or sometimes there's things that are all bad
and how do you pick a winner, which is the

00:58:53.599 --> 00:58:54.599
greatest flaw?

00:58:54.599 --> 00:58:56.500
And you know, how do you say which was worse?

00:58:56.500 --> 00:58:57.709
That someone over cooked a piece of meat?

00:58:57.709 --> 00:59:02.910
Or that someone forgot to put their sauce
on the plate?

00:59:02.910 --> 00:59:12.509
And it really becomes like nit picking, taking
apart every dish and every component and figuring

00:59:12.509 --> 00:59:16.890
out which elements were better, which were
worse and then looking at it as the whole

00:59:16.890 --> 00:59:17.890
picture.

00:59:17.890 --> 00:59:21.449
So we look at their knife skills we look at
you know, their intention is really important

00:59:21.449 --> 00:59:22.449
too.

00:59:22.449 --> 00:59:25.551
Because sometimes I'll eat something and I
won't think it's that great, but did it have

00:59:25.551 --> 00:59:26.551
a purpose?

00:59:26.551 --> 00:59:30.319
Maybe they did that for a reason and if they
did and that's how they wanted it to be thatís

00:59:30.319 --> 00:59:33.469
why it's so important to get in front of them
at the judges table and ask them what their

00:59:33.469 --> 00:59:35.900
intention was.

00:59:35.900 --> 00:59:37.489
Did they listen to the challenge?

00:59:37.489 --> 00:59:40.509
How well did they adhere to what they were
supposed to do and was that successful?

00:59:40.509 --> 00:59:44.410
Would I want to pay for this dish if I were
at a restaurant?

00:59:44.410 --> 00:59:48.309
And which one would I go back for again, I
try to close my eyes sometimes and think ok

00:59:48.309 --> 00:59:54.459
if I walked away and two days from now, which
of these dishes would I want to eat again?

00:59:54.459 --> 00:59:56.880
And so those are kind of all exercises we
have to do.

00:59:56.880 --> 00:59:58.739
And sometimes it is really hard.

00:59:58.739 --> 01:00:03.170
I mean that's a good thing when there's five
dishes that are all great, it actually means

01:00:03.170 --> 01:00:06.729
that we were really successful, it just makes
our job harder but that's a really good problem

01:00:06.729 --> 01:00:07.729
to have.

01:00:07.729 --> 01:00:10.910
So it just takes, you know practice and talking
it over.

01:00:10.910 --> 01:00:14.869
It's also really important, what I didnít
talk about before with the question about

01:00:14.869 --> 01:00:16.999
our roles on the show.

01:00:16.999 --> 01:00:20.779
It's also really important to have a lot of
different opinions.

01:00:20.779 --> 01:00:21.910
Because then there's a lot more balance.

01:00:21.910 --> 01:00:26.069
And often Tom or Padma or the guest judge
who is even more objective cause they've never

01:00:26.069 --> 01:00:29.299
eaten these peoples food before, they have
a different take on it.

01:00:29.299 --> 01:00:32.769
And sometimes they'll change my mind because
I'll think that I like it at first bite but

01:00:32.769 --> 01:00:37.710
when we talk it over they'll explain to me
that they looked at it this way or I looked

01:00:37.710 --> 01:00:38.710
at it another way.

01:00:38.710 --> 01:00:42.769
It's helpful to have that conversation and
we really end up, that's why we're talking

01:00:42.769 --> 01:00:44.509
till 7 am often.

01:00:44.509 --> 01:00:47.969
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #2: That's fascinating,
thanks.

01:00:47.969 --> 01:00:54.019
Is part of the, I've always kind of also wondered
whether some of the challenges are to make

01:00:54.019 --> 01:00:56.279
it, some of the dishes worse?

01:00:56.279 --> 01:00:57.279
I mean really?

01:00:57.279 --> 01:01:02.619
&gt;&gt;Gail Simmons: you know, it's interesting,
I donít think to make it worse, it's certainly

01:01:02.619 --> 01:01:04.160
to make it harder.

01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:07.150
Especially now that people think oh these
challenges are getting more and more ridiculous,

01:01:07.150 --> 01:01:14.119
but really if we wanted them to cook in a
quiet cool calm kitchen, exactly how they

01:01:14.119 --> 01:01:16.920
cook every day in their own restaurants we
would just go eat in their own restaurants

01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:19.309
and that would make for really boring television.

01:01:19.309 --> 01:01:23.709
It needs, there needs to be a way to take
them all out of their comfort zones and put

01:01:23.709 --> 01:01:27.210
them into situations they wouldnít necessarily
be in because we want to see how time and

01:01:27.210 --> 01:01:32.799
again they can do that and still produce great
dishes, cause that to me is the sign of a

01:01:32.799 --> 01:01:41.519
really talented craft, craftsmanship, crafting
of their food.

01:01:41.519 --> 01:01:42.519
You know what I mean.

01:01:42.519 --> 01:01:45.289
That if we gave them the same things or made
it really easy and put them in the circumstances

01:01:45.289 --> 01:01:47.929
that they were used to, it wouldn't be a challenge.

01:01:47.929 --> 01:01:54.150
So even though , yes it's crazy that we make
them ski and then shoot and then cook, we

01:01:54.150 --> 01:01:58.189
want, you know cooking in a kitchen after
12 hours you cook differently than when you're

01:01:58.189 --> 01:02:00.199
bright eyed and bushy tailed at the start
of the day.

01:02:00.199 --> 01:02:03.700
So we wanted to exhaust them a bit, we want
to see their endurance, we want to see their

01:02:03.700 --> 01:02:07.709
sense of urgency those are actually very real
skills you need to have in a kitchen.

01:02:07.709 --> 01:02:13.719
So we need to make it hard, because we need
to separate you know, the best from the worst.

01:02:13.719 --> 01:02:16.549
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: And that's all we have
time for.

01:02:16.549 --> 01:02:17.549
Thank you for coming.

01:02:17.549 --> 01:02:18.549
&gt;&gt;Gail Simmons: Thank you so much.

01:02:18.549 --> 01:02:19.549
Thank you guys.

01:02:19.549 --> 01:02:20.549
[applause]

01:02:20.549 --> 01:02:21.549
&gt;&gt;Frank Bruni: You are, are you signing books?

01:02:21.549 --> 01:02:22.549
&gt;&gt;Gail Simmons: Yeah, sure.

01:02:22.549 --> 01:02:23.549
&gt;&gt;Frank Bruni: Ok.

01:02:23.549 --> 01:02:23.552
&gt;&gt;Gail Simmons: Absolutely.
