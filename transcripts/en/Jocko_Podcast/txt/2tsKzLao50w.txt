Speaker 1:          00:00:00       This is Jocko podcast number 25 with Echo Charles and me, Jocko Willink. And once again we have this evening Jody Mitic and if you didn't listen to the last podcast, this is our first double guests. He's been on the podcast twice. We went so long on the first podcast that we had to break it up into two podcasts, but Jody had a lot of, been through a lot of stuff, had a lot of stuff to talk about. Canadian army soldier sniper, served in Afghanistan, member of the city council up in Ottawa. He's been on TV. He wrote this book right here. Boom. It's called unflinching, the making of a Canadian sniper and he was wounded in Afghanistan, lost d, double amputee below the knees. And uh, we talked about that on the first podcast. If you haven't lived on, on podcast number 24, if you haven't listened to that one, listen to that one first so you get the context of what we're about to go into tonight.

Speaker 1:          00:01:14       But welcome to the show once again, Jodi. Awesome man. Thank you. Appreciate it. Echo Charles. Good evening. Good evening. So or this one since we already talked for a long time on the first one. It didn't feel like a long time. No it didn't. But this time we got some, we did get some questions from the interwebs and it was now do you strictly pull from Twitter or do you get emails? Email. Get on Twitter. I get Facebook. And what about your Instagram? Okay. The problem with Instagram is you can't copy and paste from Instagram. Oh that's on my phone into the document that I travel with. And you're going, so Twitter is the one that Twitter is the easiest one. Facebook's fine too. But I primarily use Twitter to get the questions from all the troopers out there. That and it keeps the questions short.

Speaker 1:          00:02:05       Yes. You have 140 characters. Yeah. And we know I've got now, so I have something called the the question podcast question bank. Right. Which I've caught, captured every question that anyone's ever asked me. They're in there and I just, every time I, you know, you got a chance of coming up in the lottery every time. Nice. Cause I go through it and I go through all from the beginning and just look for questions that are pertinent. Maybe the pertinent of the topic that I'm talking about that night. Maybe it's pertinent to something that's going on in the world, but I just pick them and say, oh yeah that, that's a question that people have or I'll see repetitive question people, a bunch of different people will ask me the same thing and then that becomes one of the questions. But that's kind of how we've been doing it. Right. So do you, do you find you get, cause you, you know, we, I don't want to hash it out too much, but like your podcast went from nonexistent to number one in a boat like six days or something crazy

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       like that. Like you, you left the Joe Rogan podcast, did, you did started your own hit number one. And like now like do you get too much correspondence? Like how do you keep up like I've noticed you are, you're like, you must make Twitter a daily

Speaker 1:          00:03:15       pass out. And I'll be honest with you, I don't know how long I'm going to be able to keep it up for. Yeah, because, so you're approaching critical mass. I'm approaching critical mass where I'm going to have two more. I'm not going to be able to cause right now I read every single, probably always read them all. I mean unless it just gets crazy. But I, I I at least read them and I'll try and respond. If it's something quick, if it's not something I can respond to immediately, I'll just put it in the question bank. And

Speaker 2:          00:03:44       would you ever consider getting someone to do it for, you know, like not answer but like take it all in, record it like, so you don't have to check yourself

Speaker 1:          00:03:54       maybe. I guess that seems like something Tim Ferris would tell me to do, which is we just smart or a kid in Pakistan, right? For eight bucks an hour. No. And maybe that's a smart thing to do. The problem I find with that is I wouldn't, if I was wanting to talk to me and I was one of the troopers out there, I'd want, I'd rather have take the chances of not hearing anything back from me, but know that the guy that actually read this thing was me. Oh, I ran 100% with you. I've had people,

Speaker 2:          00:04:23       well tell me to hand my stuff over. And I'm like [inaudible] cause that's me. Yeah. There one reason why I interact with Jocko on Twitter, it's because I know it's job.

Speaker 1:          00:04:32       Yeah. Yeah. And I think that's a feeling most people would have. I know I would have.

Speaker 2:          00:04:36       Yes. Who you and guess who I unfollow on Twitter when I realize, oh that's not, that's us of him or her. Oh, okay. So

Speaker 1:          00:04:44       yeah, for me it's like if you're in a leadership position and you lead, you send someone else to do your bidding. Ooh, that's to me is not good. And I wouldn't like that if I was a follower. Yeah. Well, yeah, to the whole point of social media. And the other thing is I get a lot of good feedback from people and also people are always like, oh you inspire me and you when I say you would inspire me too. Cause there's people that are out there grinding it out in their worlds, in their lives. And I say man the world is filled with a bunch of [inaudible], a bunch of Lazy slackers that I'm used to. You get on the, you get on the Twitter, the Jocko troopers, man, they're getting after it. All of them are charging. Yeah. They're not getting out there and saying hey I don't feel like I'm going to get after it today. I think I'm going to say no. They're like it's four oh seven and I'm in the game and I go damn I got to keep my game in check. Yep.

Speaker 2:          00:05:43       I love, I love it when I see like I'll see ya. Yah. Cause you always put the picture of your watch when you wake up. Yes I do. And then I'll see like a retweet with like, you know, somebody else's watch and there's like a thousand watches with like your picture and there's right next to it.

Speaker 3:          00:05:58       And I'm like, oh, it's 6:00 AM where I am all. Look at that. I love you man. But I ain't getting up at four. That's just me. I don't have any legs. So I got an excuse. Right. I don't, but uh, but it's, I feel the same cause it's like it's, it's a duty now. Yeah. You, we've put ourselves in a position where others turned to us, so now we got to turn to them. And if we don't show up, Oh, who we let in down. I'm not, it's not that I'm letting me down, you know, it's that you're going to let down all, what do you got? Like 25,000 Twitter followers or something like 40 40 40 something. Yeah. That's 40,000 people that are waiting for your 4:00 AM. Yeah. You know, that's, that's good. But it keeps you, keeps you on. It keeps you sharp.

Speaker 3:          00:06:43       It keeps you on the days. I say it, I got days where I'll look at my prosthetic legs and he'll be like, ah, the last thing I want to do is put those things on today and then I'll think about it. Everybody else that is my position and said, and I get it cause I get the same thing, right? All, hey man, thanks for being who you are and I'm thinking about them. Well they're going to get up. So who am I? You know, and I love when I find like when I following guys like you though helps me go on a lazy bitch. People see I get a lot done. Look at this guy and then, oh look at her, look at that kid. Oh Man, I better step my game up to normal people. I know a bunch of regular people with regular lives are doing what they can to get ahead and dig in and then something happened and that does fire me up.

Speaker 3:          00:07:32       You know what? That does? Fire me up to see people. It feels good. Yeah. And wanting to, yeah, just had someone today, this is this. A woman came into the gym. To my gym. Yeah. And she said, they called me down. Oh, there's someone here to see you. I'll come down and it's a woman whose daughter is fired up for the podcast, fired up for the book. They actually, they actually named it and I have a crossfit gym. It's called crossfit Overwatch. I like, yeah, you can't give me tingles. Yeah. Yeah. And it go there. Great Nouns of obviously because of, you know, Overwatch as we talk about in the book. And so yeah, here's this woman, she was like, to be honest with you, she was kind of tearing up a little bit like that, fired up. How humbling is it when somebody feels like that around you?

Speaker 3:          00:08:18       It's, it's motivating to me. Nobody, it's today think that you can have that you like in my case me that Jody Mitic, the guy who just wanted to be a soldier and somebody is that like fired up to meet me, that they're shaking. Damn. Well I gotta I gotta I gotta keep my game up. Yeah. And it's weird too, and we actually talked about this on the podcast wants is like don't put me on a pedestal as if I'm something great cause I'm not man. I'm not. I'm, I'm uh, I'm weak and soft and do stupid things. You know what I mean? Don't put

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       me on a pedestal, but put yourself on a pedestal, you know, put yourself on a pedestal and rise up yourself. Don't worry about me. Spring board off my back and go to a higher level. That's what I want to see happen. That's what I would want. I don't want people to put me on a pedestal. I want them to stand on my shoulders and go higher and further than anything I could ever do. That's what I like.

Speaker 2:          00:09:18       Did it, did it take you, this is a personal question on my end. Did it take you awhile to see like when somebody would say, you inspire me and thank you for being who you are. Did you accept that at first or did you have to tell them like Donna, now I don't it like you just said like, I'm nothing special. But how long did it take you before you would, except that compliment without, without dismissing it. I literally,

Speaker 1:          00:09:44       right. The first person that's said that to me, I said, no man, you inspire me. You know, because your guess what? I've had a great life. I've had a great life and I'm stoked. Right. Okay. But look at you. You're saying I inspire you, look at you or inspire me. You're a single mom

Speaker 2:          00:10:01       with two or three jobs getting after it. And by getting after it, I mean, waiting tables, uh, working in as an admin assistant and then doing some babysitting at night. Yeah. And helped me with homework and making lunches and, and, and, right. Oh, so Jocko is really, really, no, actually you are. Yeah. You're fired up. Yeah. I just, I asked because it took me awhile because I, I, I had a real hard time with people looking at me like that and I actually would, I would be like dismissive of it. At first. I'd be like, Nah, what are you doing? What are you talking about? I'm just, I'm nobody special. Like don't, don't, don't say that. And I realized I was being a bit of a dick by completely dismissing their feelings for, for, for the situation. And then it was until I, until I realize though, and then that's when I realized I went, oh, this is, this is real. These people actually do feel this. And I'm, who am I did to dismiss their feelings, you know? So I try to try to use it to be stronger and realize like, you know, like this is real. Like people are looking up to me. So now I've got to live up to that role.

Speaker 1:          00:11:10       I'll tell you another thing that I tell people when they say something like that to me, I tell them, look, there's many people that have done way more than me and sacrificed way more than me. 100% and the fact that you think that about me, the only reason you think that about me is cause you know me. You know who I am because I stepped out of the darkness and, and into the public view. But otherwise there's a bunch of a bunch of warriors that they're never going to know their name. They're never going to be able to say, hey, you inspire me. So there's throwing that in my direction and I tell them, look, you don't, I don't inspire you. You get inspired by what I stand for. And

Speaker 3:          00:11:54       what I represent is thousands and thousands of servicemen seals. Yes. Soldiers, yes. Marines. Yes. All of them. Yeah. Yeah. That's what, that's what you're saying. And, and so on behalf of all of them, I get it. Cause you know what, those soldiers, those marines, those seals, those guys in special operations, they inspire me too. And so I think there's, that's kind of the, it's a give and take. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, no, I had to ask you, because I went through such a with, with the legs and everything, I was just trying to accept not having legs, nevermind that I had a woman come up to me and say, uh, I had to like add several actually. But this, this was like maybe the first, I think she said I lost a hundred pounds because of you. And I'm like, first of all, you don't even look like you weigh a hundred pounds.

Speaker 3:          00:12:48       And I'm like, Huh, what did I do? I'm just being me. And that was the one that really in my mind, like at that moment I went, okay, there's I gotta I gotta reevaluate what's going on here. Yeah. I can't just dismiss this as I'm just Jody Mitic anymore. Clearly, clearly there's something going on. Well I think your story in particular strikes a real chord with people because you had to overcome some crazy adversity. And by the way, your adversity, while challenging as you know, well there's guys with much more challenging adversity than you've had 10 fold, a hundred fold. And so, you know, for me it's a joke for you, you at least get a sense. But you and me both know and we've seen guys and we know guys that have had it, like I said, infinitely worse than you. Unimaginable, unimaginable. And so those guys that get up with their issues and press on and drive on, look to them for inspiration.

Speaker 3:          00:13:49       Absolutely look right past me. Look right past Jodie, look at those guys who are doing what they're doing. And that to me is, is where inspiration comes from. And so I guess inspirations around you everywhere. Yeah, really is if you open your eyes to it and you look at what other human beings do, it's, it's amazing. Yeah. It's amazing. I love, I love it. I love humans. Humans are such, we're such a species, that study, you know, like, so anyway, I know we wanted to get to the inner webs, but I wanted to have that discussion with you before we moved on because, uh, it was just important to me to hear that the discussion has been had Roger and I think it's, yeah, I think it's a, I think it's awesome. I think it's awesome. And yeah, like I said, I see why people are coming up and telling you that. Yeah, I agree with them actually. Well, thanks buddy. All right. Make me blush. We need to get to some questions from the interwebs. No. Okay, now I get it. All right, here we go.

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:14:53       Mental exercises to learn to control one's pulse and breathing in really stressful situations or when very nervous. What do you do?

Speaker 2:          00:15:04       Mental exercises. So we touched on this very briefly in the last episode, which was on the book and where I talk a little bit about sniper training. Um, visualization is probably your biggest tool and in what? In my experience, train, train the shit out of it. Train, train, train. And when you think you've trained enough to keep training, but when you're not training, think about it. Think about it. The more you think about it, become in tune with yourself. Okay? I'm going to get a little spacey here. Little earthy, just sit there because you know what you do when your sniper, you fucking sit there, you have a lot of time to yourself. You can't really talk cause you got a job to do. And what you gotta do is you just got to, okay, I know my heart rate's gonna go up here, but I got to do my best to make sure it doesn't overwhelm my motor functions.

Speaker 2:          00:16:15       And you can control it pretty meant that pretty easily if you prepare yourself for that moment. But it's all about preparation, training and visualization. Um, even like even making the shot, you know, like Tim Kennedy was on here, right. And you talked about dry firing, consider dry firing that this is your dry firing for, for your, for controlling yourself, for your brain, for your brain. Exactly. And dry fire your brain like that. And, and um, it only comes from experience. Now I guess there's probably some exceptions of the rule out there that are just born to be cold blooded killers that second they get behind a barrel. But, but for me it was, it was visualization and just preparing to accept the feelings that were coming and also overriding them cause that they could still be happening, but you can still control yourself with the right kind of preparation. And it's also a perishable skill. Funny enough, I realized, I don't know if that answered the question.

Speaker 1:          00:17:23       No, I think that's, I think that's good. And I think for me, one thing that I, that I know I do, and this is a, I guess it's, it may be considered a technique, but it's like the technique creates the solution. Let me explain this to you. One of the things that I do in stressful situations, there's something that I always try and do and that is no matter what's going on, I try and remain calm in my voice. So when things are going crazy, I try and get on the radio and say, hey, we need two more people over here. Not, we need two more people over here. So if you're gonna talk in a calm, controlled voice, then you can't be breathing hard. You can't be excited, you can't get angry, you can't get frustrated. You have to lock all that up and get it under control before you open your lips and start saying something. And so I'm always very focused on I am going to sound calm, cool and collected when I opened my mouth that way. And when, and in doing that, the only way to make that happen is to do everything we just talked about. Control your breathing, control your pulse, control your emotions, get all those things under control, and then say, all right, we need two more guys down here immediately now. And everybody goes, oh, okay, let's make this happen.

Speaker 3:          00:18:52       And for coming from you, especially you're the, in your, in your case, you are the boss. So if you're, if you're calm, cool and collected, that translates to your troopers. It absent. Right. So when we win, and it would for us as well, when we were doing Overwatch, you know, six to six, three you move into your left.

Speaker 1:          00:19:12       Well, no, no, no, no. Your left. Right. Think about what happens. What do you do that, imagine if I went shit six there on your left or on your left. Right. I'm freaking out.

Speaker 3:          00:19:21       Uh, they would, it would all be, it would be lost. But you're, that you're that voice because we're over snipers or Overwatch. We, they, the troops feel better when they know, okay, there's snipers doing Overwatch. Okay, we can, we're going to be okay. So if I get on the radio and talked the same way, so you know, nope. Okay. Yet a justifier 400 meters north, you know, fire for effect. Roger that, you know, like you got to, that's a good point. I never even thought of that. I think airline pilots trained that cause you know when you hit the turbulence and there, oh hey guys, sorry about that term. Yeah, just go ahead and put your seat and I, yeah. Actually if you hear sully, the guy that landed all may river, he's like that. Yeah. Yeah. We're going to have to write it down. They have to teach them that because that's where people are so apprehensive when they're in the plane. Part about that is he's like, yeah, well we'll be in the river. And the guy, he's like, uh, say again. We'll be in the Hudson, Roger out and like the plane, it's like real time you're watching the video and he's just like, yeah, yeah, we're in the river. We're in the room. It's like, Oh man, what? Oh,

Speaker 1:          00:20:24       by controlling these items, in order to control his voice, he's got to control his breathing. He's got to control his temper. He's got to control his emotions. And so that's what I do in those situations. And I'll tell you what, if I haven't, if I don't, if I'm not in a situation where I need to talk, I'll just talk to myself and be like, okay, you know, just say that in my head. All right, what is the next book?

Speaker 3:          00:20:44       I know we're spending a lot of time on the first question. That's, that's what saved my life.

Speaker 2:          00:20:48       Oh hmm. Staying, if I had gone into shock, dude, I'd be dead. Right? Yeah. And I say it in the book. I say I did my best to go into the zone. So I know I'm bleeding it and I know this and I know that. But in my mind it was let the system do its job. Okay. Everything's gonna be fine, Jody. It's okay. And I just, I just kept saying, talking to myself, you know, visualizing what, okay. So the chopper's going to come in, you know, and I just visualized each step and my, my, but the whole point to it was I couldn't have my pulse, you know, Jack Hammer or otherwise or bloods lost more blood loss and then your, and what happens, right? Blood gets sucked into your core when you go into shock and that sucks it out of your brain. I said I'd of everywhere we were, you know, I needed to stay conscious. So No. Anyway, long long answer for one question, but this is also something, you know, you got to learn. Practice, keep practicing it. You'll figure it out.

Speaker 1:          00:21:49       Yeah. And always, and we talk about this again all the time on the podcast. Inoculate yourself to these stressful situations. That's right. [inaudible] that's the guy's name. Yes. Stress Inoculation. Yup. Inoculate yourself to the stress so that when you, you get used to it. Yeah. The more stressful such, I mean training, going through training, man, they, they put all kinds of stresses at you so that you learn to deal with it. And if you want to learn how to cook, that's your time to practice controlling all those things. Absolutely. And I'm not trying to go level seven Zen Buddha on you all. Like you need to get in the mind state to control your breathing. Like no, it's a practical thing. It's a real thing. It's not a yoga thing. It's a practical, real thing of, Hey, get calmed down, take a deep breath, get yourself under control. Now it's time to talk and give clear, concise orders that are calm. Yeah. Or make that shot or crack one off if you're the sniper zone. Lack of bad guy. All right,

Speaker 2:          00:22:49       next question.

Speaker 1:          00:22:52       What does God think of the soldier first principle in the Canadian armed forces is expertise such as his being lost due to this?

Speaker 2:          00:23:04       Oh, I think they're talking about the, um, university ability of service, which means, uh, everyone must be able to deploy. So I didn't realize what it meant until I lost my feet and instead in my mind, you know, this was something else. Okay, I can't deploy anymore, but I can go to the sniper school and teach the next generation of snipers. Sure. But you're not going to get promoted and this and that no more. You know, like, Huh, I was supposed to get promoted to surgeon. Like, what do you, what are we talking about here? So university out of the service says if you are not deployable, you're not employable and you can't be promoted and you can't get any courses in this, that and the thing. So because of it, we lose a lot of corporate knowledge. Right. So I was, like I said, I was a, what we call a master sniper at advanced sniper.

Speaker 2:          00:23:58       And that doesn't mean I get access to the, um, Canadian temple of sniper sniper down to see the secret 13th scroll or anything. It just means I'm allowed to do the paperwork and handout qualifications and stuff like that. Now it is a very difficult qualification to achieve and they spend a lot of money getting me there and that value is completely erased with my injuries. So soldier first is, if you're not deployable yet, then you're going to, you're unemployable. Yeah. Okay. So under that system, you get however many years to recover from whatever your injury is at that point, if you're not recovering or going to recover, they will then begin the process to release you from the force. Acto they're convinced that it's required because of the size of our military. Where my take is, I believe that the opposite, because of the size of our military.

Speaker 2:          00:24:58       You want guys like me doing the training, the guys with the experience, the guys who want to be there to train the guys and can't deploy for as long as possible. Now, I'm not saying put me in a spot and leave me there for 15 years to become a dinosaur, but allow me to pass on the knowledge I have and remain useful. Right. But, but they, and they say you can for the, for the limited number of years, and they, they offer these things that they call extensions in that, but you're not going to get promoted. So forget about a better pension. You're not going to do this and you're not gonna do that. Um, and the dichotomy as the word that I, I never used to use that word as much. I used it. I was one of the few people use it, but not nearly as much as since I started listening to the Jocko podcast.

Speaker 2:          00:25:48       Um, the dichotomy of it is that we, our version of the Pentagon, and I'm going to get a lot of trouble for saying this, but there's a whole lot of people whose physical fitness probably keeps them from being able to do anything and they're not being, they're not getting least suited now. And it's one of those like open secrets, you know what I'm saying? And, uh, and I'm sorry if people get mad at me for that and stuff, but I'm willing to run half marathons and, and do crossfit without legs and stuff like that. And you still don't want to promote me or keep me? Well, I'm going to point out a few issues with your system and I, I don't blame the military, right? Like in the military as a system, like we said, the big green machine or roll on with or without you at some point you gotta worry about you.

Speaker 2:          00:26:42       And that's at some, I just started worrying about more about me than a boat, then the boat, mommy, the big mommy military. And, but then I, you know, when I look back over my shoulder, every now and then I go tell me that guy over there is deploying, show me what, show me his Med med show. Many pull ups. Can he do? Yeah. And so anyway, it's, um, I believe it, I'm sure someone somewhere thinks it's a good idea, but I think the millet, the Canadian forces should reexamine what it actually means because it's very black and white. Yeah. That's, and there's no room for, um, oh, walk. Okay. So here's an example, real quick example and we can move on. We used to have, um, we're in no rush, Jodi. We used to have a thing we call acting lacking. So you are acting as sergeant lacking qualification and it would be a way to like promote guys that maybe can't quite get, you know, maybe they did have an injury or something and um, and they got rid of it as we went back into combat basically.

Speaker 2:          00:27:47       Yeah. So you had all these guys getting smashed in combat now getting told like, oh yeah, we can't make an exception so you can't get promoted. So I was one of them. I was on the cusp of being promoted. Sergeant just had to come home and do a, what we call, it's called a small arms course and it makes you an expert in all small arms in the infantry and how to train with them to train troopers. And then you get promoted surgeon and when you learn some surgeon leadership stuff as well. But um, I was number one in my regiment to go do it. And when I got, after I got wounded, they're like, yeah, sorry man. I'm like, well, can I just be acting lacking so my pension is better? Like, Oh yeah, we don't do that anymore. Yeah, that's, I can see why.

Speaker 2:          00:28:32       I mean, we're only in combat. Guys are getting smashed all the time. So why would you want to promote them and let you know like the administrative side of the military? It can be very a heartless sometimes. Yeah. I remember when I was in San Antonio telling this to some medical colonels and she was like, Huh. She's like, I promoted a guy who's in a coma the other day. We don't, we don't give a shit down here. No. If you, if we think you deserve it, you get your promotion because we know it makes things better for you when you get out.

Speaker 2:          00:29:05       So should I be bitter about not getting promoted? No, I'm, I'm, I'm over it, but I'm bitter. You didn't get promoted how you like them apples. Yeah. Thank you. But you know, at the same time, there's a lot of amazing people in a lot of, uh, difficult spots in of leadership and you know, you gotta pick your battles too. Yeah. Right. So anyway, I'll tell you, as you pointed out, yeah, that's really good. What you said about the guys getting promoted that or Tacoma. That's awesome. I can't speak to the whole military. I can say in the seal teams we did a, we do an outstanding job of taking guys that get wounded. And

Speaker 1:          00:29:42       as a matter of fact, one of my guys who was real bad Ryan job, who is awesome, big goals. Then he got shot in the face, got blinded, and he was like, I'm staying in. He's telling me I'm staying in. I mean, you wanted to come back to Iraq. When he, before he found out he was born there, he was blind. He still wanting to come back. But, um, then like when we came home from deployment and everything, and you know, he's, he's blind and he says, yeah, I want to stay in the teams. And I talked, I was, uh, I was friends with the admiral that was in charge of all the seals. And I said, hey, sir, I know this might sound crazy, but, you know, running job, he wants to stay in the teams and just keep being a team guy. And he's like, we'll find a job for him, which is awesome.

Speaker 1:          00:30:37       It is awesome. But was he going to get promoted? He would've given where he would just, they would have put, found a job for him. And he actually ended up saying, you know, what kind of became to the same conclusion that you made, which is like, you know what, I can't do like the actual job of being a seal. Now. He had tons of lessons. He could have passed on, passed on, which would have been awesome. Uh, but he, he made a decision, hey, you know what, I'm gonna move on. Okay. And so he got out. So what would have happened? Don't know. There's, he, I, he have stayed in and I would hope, you know, that was one admiral who was a great guy, who had a great attitude and supporting and supporting the teas. And that's the one thing that, that admiral always said to me.

Speaker 1:          00:31:17       This is an admiral I worked for for about 13 months. I was the aide to the admiral in charge of all the seals. Outstanding Guy. But one of the things that he would say during meetings and you know, he'd be all these politicians that you're talking about, all these administrative people that you're talking about, all the big bureaucracy that you're talking about. And he would see what asked them. They'd go through their big presentation about, we're going to cut this, we're going to do that, we're going to buy this, but we're not gonna buy that. And he'd say, how does this affect the platoons? Oh like, cause cause people would forget that. The whole reason you're there. The whole reason to any of that infrastructure or anything is there is how does it support the platoons? How has it helped the seals? How's it help the machine gunner?

Speaker 1:          00:32:00       How does it help the sniper out there? The radio man, the guys that are actually doing the job that we have, and I say this to businesses sometimes when I work with businesses and I see that there are infrastructure's getting super big and they're starting to impose plans and and restrictions and I say, Hey, remember what you're here for. You're here to support that this guy that's on the manufacturing floor or this guy that's out there selling or this this woman that's working with the patients or whatever business it is, because it's very easy to be in a leadership position and forget about what the ground troops are doing. No debt and that's a horrible thing. That's a horrible thing. And then this thing that you're talking about soldier first, which sounds to me like soldier last because they don't want to take care of the soldiers if they want to do that because there's nobody better to prepare soldiers for combat then soldiers that had been in combat. Yeah. If I want to learn sniper, you know how I want to learn it from in Canada, Jody Mitic, you know, I want to learn it from someone that's like you. If I were to learn how to patrol and one wonder for someone like you, I don't want to learn it from a guy that theoretically understands it. Right. That's not the same thing. I want the real deal.

Speaker 2:          00:33:14       Yeah. It's, it's a policy. Again, they defended, they think it's necessary. What are you gonna do? Big Green machine just keeps on rolling. All right.

Speaker 1:          00:33:29       This is a similar question to what we've already had, but I'm going to do it again. How do you silence distraction no matter how important to achieve your number one priority.

Speaker 2:          00:33:43       Hmm. On op, when I was still a sniper, I actually had a much easier time of this. Um, I'm, I'm, I'm add in a lot of ways and, uh, whatever I want to focus on add doesn't mean that you can't focus on stuff. It just means like when the teacher tells you to focus on something, you're busy doing other stuff. And so, right, it's not a deficit disorder. It's that I don't give a shit what you're trying to show me, but that right there, that's what I want to look at. So I, um, I had a way of just, I would like if I had to watch a crossroad, I've watched that crossroad was my whole world and it wouldn't matter what we've now done. It doesn't mean I wasn't situationally aware, but I would watch that crossroad like my life depended on it or somebody's life depended on it, which, which had a lot of times it did.

Speaker 2:          00:34:45       And, um, if I have enough, what I found actually, and this is one of the reasons why I'm starting to meditate again, I'm seeing a therapist again. Um, I'm listening to Jocko podcast and reading extreme ownership. Um, no, I'm, I'm being serious is that I appreciate in my civilian post-military post wounded post addiction, um, phase world. I've, I've lost a little bit in my ability to, to, to, to push out the input. I don't want, I have a hard, I used to read a book a month at the, at the minimum, and I'm not talking like I'm talking like a book, you know, that I showed you, I had the 33 laws of war in my suitcase. I've been reading that for three months and I'm maybe half done. I have a real hard time now, um, achieving that, that zone of zero distraction and I'm trying to get it back because it's really, I get a lot done.

Speaker 2:          00:35:55       You know, I have, I have my, my politics, I have the book, I do keynote speeches. Um, I have my kids. Um, I have all my hobbies. You know, I'm, I'm trying to support veterans support charities that support veterans and uh, and I still get a lot done, but I could get so much more done if I could turn off some things in my mind sometimes. And I don't know what, what's happened or what if this is what an addict's brain is lake now, or if it's just, I'm always seeking something, I get bored easily. That's part of the EDD. I've always had that. But when I found something and latched onto it, I used to be like just, I was 100% focused until I became, you know, I got as much of that as I could and then I would move on to the next thing.

Speaker 2:          00:36:45       And, um, yeah, I, I, I gotta be honest. I've, I've visualization though, going back to the first question is one way that you can do it. And I've started meditating to get my mind back into that state. I used to do a lot of yoga and I used to do a lot of mindfulness, uh, not training. I don't know what people see now. It's called mindfulness training back then. I think it was just called reflection or something. I call it Jujitsu. Yeah. Well, when I'm done the bodybuilding show in November, I will start Jujitsu. Oh, you, you might actually be starting to do two tomorrow. My Bro just don't hurt me. Doesn't hurt everyone I know who starts Jujitsu hurt something. That's why I'm holding off. But I would, I will definitely come let you a ragdoll me. But my point is that I've lost it and I'm probably the last guy to give you advice right now on how to lock out the world because I have to put on headphones and crank music to get through a workout right now. And I know this, I didn't know I'm detrimental in it and I, and I, and I'm aware of it and I'm trying to correct it and uh, and it bugs the shit out of me. They really does. It makes me feel like less of a person.

Speaker 1:          00:38:04       So let me tell you about a transition that I went through. Yes. First of all, before the war I, than military sent me to college. So I had to go to college and I, as I said earlier, or as I said before, I was super focused. When I went to college, I'd been in the seal teams for 10 years. I was a go getter. I was a hard charger. I was like, Oh, you want me to read this book? Boom. I would sit down and just force myself to read it and then got back to the seal teams and like, like when I went to college, I literally read every single thing that I was assigned and nobody does that in college. Nobody does that. I read every single page of every single thing I was assigned during college. That's ridiculous. It's almost a waste of time.

Speaker 1:          00:38:46       It's almost embarrassing. Echo definitely thinks it's a waste of time, but, but it was because I just could just go lock my brain down and get it done. Get back to the teams and the teams officer in the teams, you have a lot of administrative paperwork to do evaluations and after actions reports and all these things. And I would do the same thing. I'll just go into lockdown mode in my, put my brain on it and boom, I'd go through it and just get it done. I would just be able to focus. So they each thing, laser focus. These are folks that report done. God, give me that. Oh, come on. Report done. Okay. Okay. So I go to Iraq the first time, no big deal. I go to Iraq the second time. Do you know it's a much tougher deployment. It's guys are getting wounded, guys, my guys are getting killed and I come home and I get put into a run in the training and with running the training all of a sudden, yeah, there's administrative requirements and there was administrative requirements overseas as well.

Speaker 1:          00:39:44       And you know what? We did locked him down and got them done. I get home and I remember the first time I get to do, I think it's evaluations, which in the military and the Navy anyways, doing evaluations is a real pain. It's a real big administrative administration of or a v value shopping of all the troops. So at this place I was at huge running training. I had a hundred guys and every one of them is like a little mini term paper or something. It has to be perfect. It's in a person's military record forever. That really stressful about it. And I used to have no problem just to hammer on those things out. So I get back from that deployment and, and I'm sitting down in and you know, I start doing it. I'm like, ah, this is stupid. This doesn't matter. I don't know why I'm doing this.

Speaker 1:          00:40:24       Right. Well how do I have to do that? Kind of started saying the same things that I would always brag on people for saying like, this is stupid. Oh, now your men are stupid. You don't want to fill out the report and take care of your guys. You don't want to write a good [inaudible] career isn't worth your five minutes or five is okay. You know? So I, I heard myself saying this right, and what and what, what the constant undertone of all this was that this stuff doesn't matter. Combat Wolves, what mattered. And, and when you get back from that situation where man, your buddies are getting killed, you're getting wounded, your friends are getting wounded, this piece of paper, it doesn't matter. And you say to yourself, I don't care about this. And at some point, and it didn't, it took me maybe two or three months. I did what I had to do to get by. But as I sit there and I looked at myself and I said, you know what?

Speaker 1:          00:41:25       Combat doesn't matter anymore. You're not in it. You're not in it right now. Right. This is now what matters. Your, your mind was still there. My mind was still there thinking that that was all that matters. And like I said on our last podcast, actually it's in the past and it doesn't matter anymore. So you know what you have to do. You have to be a man and you have to do your job now and this is what matters now. And that to me made a big transition for me and it, you know, I haven't even thought about this until, until you were talking about it. Cause I remember what it was like to, to go from when I went to college and what I was before I deployed Romani now would just be sold, laser focused, be to be able to just burn through things.

Speaker 1:          00:42:14       And then when I got back and it was not there and it was all because I thought, oh, this stuff doesn't matter. This doesn't matter. It doesn't matter what matters you, there's guys getting killed overseas right now. That's what matters. And I had to say, you know what, no, that stuff doesn't matter right now. And you know, and also I was in charge of training and I said, well what matters is doing this, getting guys trained to go overseas. And I became obsessed with that and slightly psychotic about getting guys ready for combat. I mean I was preparing them for what they're preparing them for, what they're going into. And you know, you could, I'm sure there were many uh, seals that went through the training that I was overall in charge of and would attest to the fact that I was probably pretty borderline psychopathic at that point.

Speaker 1:          00:42:57       But I think that that was a long run in my training and it'll sense dude, but I want to psycho running my combat training. Yup. Yup. So I go ahead. Okay. You were just going to say you think, I think that telling yourself and recognizing to yourself, why are you trying to do this thing? Because you're trying to do something because it does matter, right? It has to matter in some way. Even if it's just filling out the paperwork to get your license from the DMV. Oh, that doesn't matter. Oh, actually no. What? It does matter. You're going to get arrested. If you could pull it, you know, it's like, no, it does matter. These little things, these little stupid, meaningless tasks in life, they actually do matter. So you know what you do. You line them up and you freaking crush them. That's what you do.

Speaker 1:          00:43:42       That's what you do. You line up these stupid meaningless things and you crush them and you use them as an exercise in discipline. They become an exercise and discipline, oh, this thing doesn't matter. Guess what? I'm going to crush it now. Bring it to me. Where's my DMV form? Watch me fill this out. That's what I'm going to do. So maybe I turned like some little meaningless things into a personal competition of discipline, but maybe it's how consistent are you making that happen though? This is, I'm [inaudible] to tell you. So for instance, since we started the podcast, I have to read, you know, basically a book a week and then once I read it, I've got to go back into it. Yeah. You do like a book report and, and go back through it and say, and how is this going to flow together? What part? So I'm spending a lot of time on that right now and I've been able to do it every time so far.

Speaker 2:          00:44:35       Okay. Um, so I think my, cause I've lost my ability to be consistent and that's, that's what's really bumming me out. Like when I, when I, your book isn't, I mean it's thick, but I should have been able to read this and two or three solid days of reading. Yes. I told you how successful I was. Yes. Not Very. And that bugs the shit shit at him and I, it's a, it's a, it's a, uh, it's a fail. It says it's a,

Speaker 1:          00:45:07       you know what though? I think this is a failure on my part. I, I think that this is the same thing that we were talking about on the last podcast and I think echo said when you say, Oh, you know what? I'm not going to finish this book right now. It's it. I don't really want to. It's sort of like when you say, Oh, I'm not gonna quit too though. That's what I'm saying. You say, but I don't want to do it right now. I can push it off a little bit. You accept that you accept that answer. You accept that answer. The soldier Jodi wouldn't accept that answer. Would not do self-talk. Not really. Not really. I'm not a guy that says, you know, I'm going to do this or going to do that. I just do it. Right. I just go and do whatever that thing is. I think because you're, you

Speaker 4:          00:45:58       kind of have become that. So it's more of like an input kind of crudely that's habitual for you to just do it in our member hall. And it was, I think it was kind of funny where, where I use this example like how you said use it as an exercise of diff discipline. So I said this example one time where I was in line at the grocery store and I had a 12 pack of beer. Do we have to relearn this story right now? And I was standing in line and there was maybe three, four people in front of me. So I'm like all right, it's going to be a while for me to get up there. This beard is getting you decided you're going to hold the beer. I remember the story. I remember this story. Yeah. So exactly right. But it wasn't that okay. And the reason I decided to hold the beer, it wasn't because that benefited me right then it, it was an exercise in mental stuff. But here's the create. Okay. We're good.

Speaker 2:          00:46:43       Way Off the question, but physical tasks. Sure, no problem. Yeah, cause it's, it's visceral. It's real. I can feel it. But to sit down and read the report on the sewer charges that are going to be coming in on the tax report for the city next year. What's on

Speaker 4:          00:47:02       going on on Twitter. It all like kind of the same thing though, really is, but I'm wondering, I'm wondering if my brain hasn't replaced the oxycontin with social media. Yeah. Like I had to quit drinking

Speaker 2:          00:47:13       because okay. We now we're way off the thing, but the, the hardcover came out last September and hardcover. Oh, sorry. I've unflinching uh, the making of a Canadian sniper by Jody Mitic printed by Simon and Schuster and it available on Amazon through Jocko store.com. Click the link to Amazon. Um, but yeah. Okay. Yeah. Well, I already said, I already said it. I already said it. So anyway, the hardcover came out drinking. I drank every day from the date came that day. So we had 450 people at the event. Uh, uh, Kevin Newman, my buddy who's, who's, uh, he's a well known news anchor and Canada does an interview with me on the stage and we got standing ovation. We go out, we celebrate me, the president of the company, my editor, wait, we have a good night, good night. And the next day, if I didn't have one drink, I was having 10 and that went from September to the new year and I was getting fat and I, you know, I was sleeping in because I'm hung over and I'm not going to the gym.

Speaker 2:          00:48:17       And I went, oh hang on, what's going on? Because this is cause I have my job as politician, I'm Daddy, you know, I'm friend. You know, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm advocate and then you know, the book is, it's a job, right? You know, selling a book's a job full time job. I need nine days a week and 36 hours a day to do it. And so I had to make, that's one of the reasons why I decided to do the bodybuilding thing cause I'm like well you can't drink and it'll be right until November cause I need that. So I'm trying to figure out if my brain is looking for a new habit because I was diagnosed before, I was like auntie addictive. If that's even a real thing, but I had a doctor tell me when she was like, you're pretty much an anti addictive personality, like you won't get addicted to stuff and narrow was addicted. Doxy cotton even though it's a physical thing more than a mental thing, but I still wouldn't trust me with a pill right now. Yeah. Anyway, I think we go way off track, but I just

Speaker 1:          00:49:15       again, and I don't know what your therapist is going to tell you. I'm going to tell you what Jocko would tell you though. These little things are things that you, I know you know how to do them. You've done your whole career in the military, you are watching a crossroad and I know that might sound exciting to people that are out there that are thinking how crazy that must be. No, there's times where Jody was walking watching a crossroad and there was nothing going on for four days and he was watching that crossroad and so you have that in you. You just got to tell yourself that, you know what, this stuff now this is what matters and how are you going to tell yourself that this is what matters. It's because this is how it connects to the strategic picture. You can't say that this matters because of what it is right in front of me.

Speaker 1:          00:50:00       Just like when you're looking at the crossroads, you're not thinking, oh this crossroads is important because the crossroads is important. No the car, the reason it's important is because you are supporting keeping guys alive, which is going to help a mission out, which is going to help the, the overall strategy, wind commander's intent, commander's intent, the whole [inaudible] the commander. Now you are the commander and also what's your longterm mission? And that's what I kind of, you just said to yourself like, oh I picked bodybuilding cause I there you just gave yourself a mission. Right? So what's your administrative, you know,

Speaker 3:          00:50:28       Echo made some big advances lately cause he started freaking reading books and he wasn't doing that before, but he, he got the longterm mission of like, you know what, I'm going to learn as much as I possibly can. So you got a longterm mission with your constituents to be the best city councilman and represents. So when they ask you a question you're like boom, that's kind of the quarter psycho stuff that I would say is like if anybody ever asked me a question like when I was going to college, if it asked me any question about any of the reading, I'm going to know it. That's just a bizarre p uh oh. What's that OCD thing to be like? I'm going to know everything. So you have four kids, you train every day, you get up at four in the morning. I've got to get up at four in the morning. That's my answer.

Speaker 3:          00:51:15       Sorry to riff on you guys on that man. Like, I know you want to do the questions. But when that guy, when that like the, the first question was easy cause I'm like, oh, I'll just talk about what I used to do. And then that one was like, well, if I was to try and answer right now, I'd be lying, I'd be a liar and I can't, I have my moments still, don't get me wrong. I'll have moments where I'm like, this has to get done and I'll fire through a speech or I'll, I'll write a report or whatever it is and then a, and then I lose it. And it's like, ah, ah fuck. It's gone. And that's actually reinforcing what I just said. So when you have a near term mission that you know what the outcome would you know what the result is?

Speaker 3:          00:51:52       You know what the end state is. You know what the commander's intent is like, Hey, you've got a speech in two days. Okay now it's in one day. You can sit down and concentrate and get it done. Which where you've missed the connection now is the connection between these menial tasks that don't mean anything. And how can I put them to a long term strategic goal and one of those longterm strategic goals you can put into place. If nothing else is, I'm going to discipline my mind to do these menial tasks like a soldier and that's pretty cool. Oh yeah, it's a tee shirt.

Speaker 4:          00:52:26       Yup. Thank you Jocko. Whoever asked that question a thank you for asking it. Although I went off and talked about me for the most of the speaking of Tangents, echoes can take it a little further out. It's not attention. It's what you said, how you said that's what a soldier does. So that's like a little exercise and I did this before. I did this in a couple of times. Okay. Like one was how I quit drinking was I figured out, and you can do this with your diet as well. I figured out that basically through all this stuff that I read that you're wanting to eat junk food or drink or whatever, is your brain tricking you because it's built to, it's evolved for a certain environment. That environment doesn't work, isn't around anymore. Yeah. So now we're in an environment of abundance has to do with don't mean anyway, come to the conclusion that it's your brain falling for a trick. Your physiology of the brain falling for a trick makes you want this stuff. How he says how Jocko says, that's not what a soldier would do. I had it in my mind, I'm not going to for that trick. I'm

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       not a sucker. That's not, you know, doing this is what suckers do. I'm not a sucker and this is just like self talking to yourself. So I essentially shamed myself out of drinking. Yeah. Just like he's doing the, basically the inverse into focusing,

Speaker 2:          00:53:41       you know, I just remember like I w I'm the guy that we were in Kosovo, I quit smoking in a day because I couldn't run up the hill next to her camp. I said, well obviously these things aren't good anymore. And I literally just, I just, I even had a pack of my pocket for like a week. I just like, Oh yeah, okay. Just throw those out. I want that guy back. And I'm in search. I think it's been 10 years since I was wounded. I think I'm going to find them again probably on the stage for this bodybuilding thing or something. But yeah, I just, I just couldn't answer that question without talking about that because I wouldn't have been truthful at this point in my life.

Speaker 1:          00:54:19       And that's what's cool is maybe that question right there was something that is forcing you to face that. I mean you might've had at the back of your mind, but now you're going, you know what, I can't answer that and I want to see, cause I'm not there right now. I'm not, but I'm going to get back there real quick. My moments. So standby people, standby soldiers coming back online. Reboot Jody. 3.0 all right, next question. This is all, just read it. How you prepared mentally, what kind of discipline you had. Routines in and out of battle.

Speaker 2:          00:54:55       How I prepared mentally.

Speaker 5:          00:54:58       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:54:58       Routines in n out of battle.

Speaker 1:          00:55:01       Yup. What kind of discipline you had and routines in and out of battle. Um,

Speaker 5:          00:55:11       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:55:11       I'm going to fall back on

Speaker 2:          00:55:15       mental routine I think is probably your, your your biggest cause the physical one is easy. Okay. He, he come back. So battle doesn't mean, you know, you're in gun fights all the time, you know, like, like we say w if first and still we're patrolling. Right. You know, which just a static patrol. So you know, you gotta make sure your gear's good. You got to make, you know, are your batteries changed? Right? You guys like there's all the ways, the checklist, checklist, checklist, checklist. As a leader it actually makes it easier I found because now I have a reason to check their stuff and check that their routine. So my routine stayed solid. Right. Cause I think I had other guys I had to worry about. Um, so rest is a big one. I used to have to order my guys to go to ground because they were so, cause there's only three of us and I used to, my barrier, especially I'd be like, Barry, you need to be useful. I need you to sleep. So my routine was like, make sure enough rest. Make sure, because you know that the saying mission before man,

Speaker 2:          00:56:19       sure. Except when the man is the mission. So I my man to be good. Yeah. And I'm going to say, if you abuse your man too much, you won't accomplish the mission. So like, you know, you know, the sacrifice the body. Well, let's wait. Let's think about that because the body is what needs to get this thing. There's only, there's only three of us. And in our case, you know, of your sniper, you're, you might be alone, you might be with a one or two other guys. I can't afford to have a guy run head at first through a doorway to get through it because I need him to be useful after, you know, if you have a platoon, sure. You Sacrifice Smith, he runs through the door. Hey, okay, you got 29 more guys, I can go through the door. Um, so my routine was always like, you know, make sure everything's topped up.

Speaker 2:          00:57:02       Keep an eye out, you know, uh, do the, do the mental checklist and then visualize visually, like out of battle. I would try to, you know, I'd be on my, I remember I'd lay on my bunk and I'd have my, and I'd always ended up with my right foot crossed over my left foot and my am I am my arms up here on my chest and I'd have my head back and I would be going, okay. So, okay if we go down and you know, and if contact left and I would try to like, you know, visualize these things, you know, cause as the team leader, I had the radio and I was security because my boys, when they're in position, you know, my spotter is spotting my shooters shooting, so like they're 12 o'clock. So I'm now everything, everything, the rest of the clock for them and for myself.

Speaker 2:          00:57:49       So I was constantly rehearsing mentally what would, what could happen. I'm calling and I'm practicing a call for fire. I'm practicing and calling in an airstrike and practicing a nine liner. I'm practicing, um, uh, just a grit. What do you guys do you guys use that turns the nine line four nine nine line is a casualty evac. Uh, call for fire nine line. Yeah. Um, no, no, but grit and I group range indication during the fire. Yup. Yup. So my first, even with all the visualization, my first actual grit in a battle was did in bed to bed to, to tobacco. There it's supposed to be six, three, uh, 300 by that tree, you know, all, you know, um, a farm for a fact or at your own time or something like that. Calm, cool, collected voice. But, you know, the guy was like 40 meters away and it was like in my sniper was actually looking over him.

Speaker 2:          00:58:47       Waveys like, I'm, you know, I'm looking at that stuff and I was like, fuck it, and I just shot on myself. But, uh, but my point is that even with all of that practice and visualization and training, you know, that was my first attempt. Um, so I was always just trying to make sure that my routine off off the battlefield was putting my mind back, but in a controlled setting, you know, and, and all. And, and then also, like I said, make sure, okay, yeah. How much sleep did you get? K? Good, good, good. And that's the routine that, you know, that you got to get the guys to relax. Especially like for me, I had to, I just had to make sure, cause I only had me and two other guys, I couldn't afford to lose one of them, whether it was to exhaustion or malnutrition or dehydration or sprained ankles or whatever, you know.

Speaker 2:          00:59:39       So I just, I just did my best to keep, keep that checklist going and, and visual. And I would encourage them to do the same. I'd be like, Hey, what are you thinking about over there? All, you know, whatever. It'd be like, Hey, you want you to think about, uh, you know, remember when you may like, or do make making that shot and you missed or whatever. Like, try and visualize, try and think about what you did. You know, there's a lot of steps that go into pulling the trigger, you know, and, and, um, and then, you know, just think about that. Think about how it happened and encourage that. You know, I'm, I'm a big fan of, um, of meditation and Yoga and all that stuff. Like if any, like I think an our side of the world, we've lost a lot of that stuff.

Speaker 2:          01:00:21       And I know we tried to get it back and got people that do it are tree hugging, you know, a spandex wearing Weirdos or whatever. But Yoga and meditation and stuff like that's all warrior culture from the past, you know, you know, like Samurai meditate, you know, ain't warrior monks a fasted and prayed. That's just meditation. And they looked inside themselves a lot to try and you know, a Samurai's job was pretty tough. Call him a pussy for meditating, make sure I'm there so I could watch. And, and I, and I firmly believe that that type of stuff keeps you functional for when you hit the battlefield. You know, that self, you know, as Grossmann calls it the self reflection, self inoculation as well. So that was my routine. It was just a constant rotation of thoughts and then, but the actions were always to prepare the, you know, the situation for what was coming. Does that make sense?

Speaker 1:          01:01:23       Yeah. Okay. Yeah. The one, uh, one thing that I, that's actually a pro, I like a really practical thing that I did that and that is I had, uh, this is again, this is just a real practical thing. I had two cots, right? Slept in a cot, slept in one, caught something, one caught the other cop was all my gear and it was just laid out going body armor, you know, everything was right there. And when I, when I got dressed to go out, all that thing was empty and so never forgot anything. When I came back, everything went right back on the cop spot. Same spot, everything squared away. So those, that to me was, and I figured that out really quickly. Okay. Just going to, I don't want ever want to forget anything. Here's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna put everything that I need right here. Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:02:16       That I had, I didn't even think of it around my, you know how he said I would sit there,

Speaker 3:          01:02:20       right foot over the left. [inaudible] all around me because we had a cot, we had a cot. We didn't, we couldn't afford to Canadian army. Okay. Sorry. Um, but around I had, we all had two by fours around us cause we were in like a, a fog. We built ourselves and each nail had it. So I had my, my chest rig, my rifle, uh, my ammo pouches and uh, you know, like, and then all around and, but that was what I would, when I would go through my stuff. That's what I mean. Like I would hang it up, open up the pouch. Okay. Everything's there, close it next pouch, make sure top up my mags, all that stuff. And I would make sure I'd make, get the guys who do the same thing and when you're ready to go out or an operation, all your nails were empty.

Speaker 3:          01:03:00       That means you've got everything. Yeah. But the biggest thing with route, like Peop, people call it a routine and they think there's magic to it, right? There's not, it's just making sure you do the same thing over and over and over again. You know, as, as, as magical as navy seals and snipers want to be like, it's not really that, it's not that mystical, I guess. Um, it's a, it's just a lot of repetition, you know, the routine is that you repeat the same actions because that was me. That's what makes you good at them. Yeah. I was to, I was telling you when we were driving over, here are some point how we use to try and do everything. Yeah. When you would fire up the hours together, five or six Home V's lined up for an operation, they'd all be lined up, ready to go.

Speaker 3:          01:03:42       And then everyone would like get the word, it'd be like load them up and then you just see everyone would just get in the zone, boom. You'd see them getting the vehicles and then we'd start the vehicles at the same time. There's no reason to do that. No, but there is, I know the have loves dog type. There's no, there's no, um, definable reason why you would do that. But our deal was, you know, okay. Starting up in three, two, one start up and then you hear all the vehicles startup wants to and it's just like all those little things would the, all those little disciplines would lend themselves to the team being more disciplined. Those ignition switches might as well have been the switch and each guy's mind. Yup. Yup. As the, as that vehicle is starting, everyone's brain is going into combat mode and we're together at the same time synchronized from the word go when that, I love it when you told me that that was, I was like, yeah, that'd be the most bad ass thing to watch a bunch of navy.

Speaker 3:          01:04:40       Imagine what's your navy seals load up and they have vehicles all started the same time I'd run. I'd be like, I'm not fucking with these guys. I'm out of here. It was a, it was an awesome sight of that when my guys, when I was a task unit commander, you know, I'd be sitting on basis, guys, we're rolling out and I'd stand out there and salute him like just like old school. Right. Cause. But it's, you know, it was, uh, and they, I bet. And they loved you for it by, by while I love those guys. But the, the, those guys, I mean every time you rolled out in the streets to Ramadi, there was a decent chance you got to quit getting blown up. There was a, a gunfight was almost

Speaker 1:          01:05:18       guaranteed to happen. But the guys getting blown ids was a real issue for you guys. A and, and I was thinking about this today, the ids there was, we had statistically the most heavily id road in all of Iraq was route Michigan going from one end to the one ended Ramadi to the other. Yeah. And there was ids all over the place. It was, I mean it was, it was ridiculous. And we didn't hit Amy. I edis while we were there, which I was thinking about that today cause I was thinking about my EOD contingent had to, or do you guys, and I never told them like, hey, we never hit an IED. Thank you. Never told him that. So you credit them with that? I credit them with part of it. Yeah. Part of the briefings that they gave part of the, now there were some close calls, uh, life's platoon.

Speaker 1:          01:06:12       And matter of fact, it's in the book when they, the EOD guys were watching the front door, they couldn't quite keep an eye on it, but they were, they did a really good inspection of it. When they came back out there, like something looks different, they would gather there's 120 millimeter mortar id that would've taken out, I don't know, four or five guys. Yeah. Uh, there was a time where we went over, we went over an IED will, uh, the point man navigator in the vehicles was like, Hey, I think there's something specific suspicious actually got out of the vehicle to look at it. And we're like, hmm. Yeah. Looking back, what do you think about that decision making process? You know, maybe that wasn't a good one. Anyways, we decided, oh, I don't think it is. We drove over it and about half an hour later, the IED, a clearance team found a triple stack.

Speaker 1:          01:07:00       One 20. So that's everybody in the vehicle dead. Um, if, uh, so yeah, ids were massive threat, the number of guys that were killed and wounded by ids and Ramadi was ridiculous. There was a hole, there was a vehicle graveyard, you know, vehicles that had been blown up and then drag back in with, I mean, it was, it was massive. I mean, I want to say 50 to 100 vehicles aren't just piled up and including m wraps, which are the mine resistance vehicles. Those things are, they're broken in half. Yeah. What kind of bombed you got to put together to do that?

Speaker 2:          01:07:35       Yeah. Ooh, we got real lucky and I know this sounds weird. My rotation, they had conventional minds, so any purse and any tank and there was the occasional IED, but it was usually SV. Uh, and uh, and in the city, s v means a suicide vehicles. So, um, our, uh, our regimental sergeant major and his driver were killed by a suicide vehicle. Borne IED. Yup. And I stepped on a landmine. If I'd stepped on an IED, I would've been vaporized. But the rotation that that replaced us, our sister battalion that's, we lived the, the intelligence says guys from Iraq started showing up and uh, we went from losing a tire, maybe having one guy get killed through a penetration in the hole or whatever to a, we had a whole laugh go up and seven out of the 10 guys in it were killed. And it was like, like that's how quickly it escalated and suddenly it was an issue for our, for our guys as well.

Speaker 2:          01:08:42       Almost every vehicle we had hit a landmine on my tour and that was the only time I was ever really scared over there when I was walking or in a helicopter or even out on a four wheeler, no problem. When I had to drive on the roads in a vehicle, that's when I was like, my, that pucker factor was the highest for me ever. Ids Man. Like the, and the guys that would go out every day and deal with that shit. Like d clearance guys, Fox man. Like my hat always came off to those guys. Yeah. Like talk about a nerve wracking job. Yeah. Yeah. What's that movie with the, with the EOD guy, I don't know. Hurt, luck, hurt locker. Everybody who does that jobs is, it's a total bullshit movie. But could you imagine though that's your Gig?

Speaker 1:          01:09:32       Well, like we had an embedded EOD guys with us and those usually have a EOD navy EOD guys that are basically like the two guys. Our guys were like, they go through our training with us, they grow, but they don't go through the basic training, the basic seal training, but they go through everything else. And our guys are like supporters, the wall, once our guys, our guys were like other seals, you know, they were that good. Yeah. And but yeah, um, it's not, it's amazing, but in the guys that are with us that with us and so they're not quite, it's their primary job for us, but it's not their primary job. Right, right. Whereas the guys that you're talking about, the guys that did route clearance, if anybody's listening to this podcast right now and you did route clearance in Iraq or Afghanistan, you, Jocko and Jody say, thank you because you saved us so many times because we drove down those roads all the time. My guys wrote down those roads all the time. And you found all those bombs that saved, saved our lives in so many lives. Kept the

Speaker 2:          01:10:36       applies rolling. Yep. Even kept the local populace safe.

Speaker 1:          01:10:39       And you know how much credit and glory those guys get? None. Not a lot. None. And there was, in Ramadi, there would be the, the big vehicle, like a buffalo, buffalo is take a giant m wrap. You have to climb a ladder to get into it. So there'd be guys in there that would disable the bombs from inside that a big robotic arm and they would do that. But behind them would be a contingent of marines in Home Viz. And I'd say, what do you guys, Oh yeah, we're just support. Get some devil dogs. Marine Corps doesn't play around.

Speaker 2:          01:11:13       They're like, oh, you need, you need support. Cool to getting home visa role behind it, but there's going to be big bombs blowing up. Yeah. We're in the Marine Corps. Yeah, no factor. We'll do you love it. I love Marines. Marine Corps. Awesome. Anyway, questions from the interwebs. Questions for the Inter webs.

Speaker 2:          01:11:33       Can you tell us about Jody, can you tell us about your wife, the medic that helped save you then you kind of talked about this a little bit on the first podcast we did together. So you know what I'll, I'll tell you about her. So Atlanta is, um, so I say her dad was in the army and he, he, he's from Ireland, he immigrated to Canada, join the military and uh, he was an airborne commando and Canada back in the day. Like that was pretty much, you know, that was our, one of our most fierce units and he commanded the jump school, which is like, whoa. Wow, that's, that's pretty bad ass. He did the American ranger course and 68. [inaudible]. Yeah, it's an old Vietnam Rangers were running, run the show got old. They were young. Sorry guys, I should have said that. The, these fresh combat experience rangers were running the show, you know, they weren't playing around.

Speaker 2:          01:12:30       Yeah. He got kicked in the spine with a steel toe boot. Yeah. And finished with a broken vertebrae and a, but you know, so I always say she was drafted into the military at birth and uh, cause she grew up on bases all over the world. Germany, um, uh, I think South America and stuff or is it her dad ended up being in a like embassy security and stuff. Um, she became a medic at a high school. Um, I think she joined at 17 as well. She's a little bit older than me. Um, and then, uh, she has more citations for saving civilians than she does receiving soldiers. She happens upon, she's like one of those, uh, angels, I guess that just won a woman. So here's one. A woman had a heart attack behind the wheel, drove into a ditch. Atlanta was right behind her, drove, stopped her car, jumped in the car, pulled her out dead.

Speaker 2:          01:13:31       Alana brought her back to life right there at the side of the road, no equipment, anything like that. Just skill, skill and determination when and kept her alive until the paramedics showed up and took over. She's got a decoration for that. Um, you know, she helped save my life and, and, and a lot of my friends and, uh, one time we were driving and we came upon a scene and we, uh, we were in my truck and Ayla was still a baby still in our baby seat. And so I look up and I, and I see it, I think she, she might have been on her phone, I don't know what she was doing. And I see scatter cars, car parts everywhere, and one lone cop standing in the middle of it, like a squirrel. And not because he's scared or anything, he's just, he's the only guy.

Speaker 2:          01:14:25       He's the first on the scene. And I look and I'm like, okay, something bad happened here. And I see one vehicle in the middle of it all. And I went to Atlanta, they need you. And she went, Huh? I said, you see that van? They need you. She jumped out, jumped headfirst through the, this van was crushed and she went in there and there was a four year old, little three year old little girl, uh, that had been hit with the car, was t boned. She stabilized the little girl's spine, uh, kept her alive until the firemen showed up. Uh, they extracted, she, she was in command of the scene and they were like, they, I guess I was doing my best to help the cop with traffic and stuff like this and uh, and deal with some of the other like minor injuries and the fireman, like the first guy to put his head and he's like, I kind of heard like, well, who is this?

Speaker 2:          01:15:15       And then all I hear is Atlanta. Like, I need this and I need like, just bark it out, all these orders. And they go, Oh yeah, okay, hang on. So they run in, they're getting all this stuff and they get the board and they put the little, the girl, the girl ended up passing away unfortunately, but, um, zero hesitation. That's, that's my wife fucking hero. And, uh, you know, she retired from the military last year and is going through, um, she probably gonna get mad at me for saying this, but she's going through it. A lot of soldiers go through the transition.

Speaker 1:          01:15:50       Oh, you mean the thing we've been talking about for the all night and all last pod.

Speaker 2:          01:15:54       Yeah. She just, she's just having a tough time figuring out who, who's Atlanta Gilmore or if she's not a soldier and she's an amazing mom. Uh, she's an amazing wife and, um, she's an amazing person. It's just in her mind, she needs to find the new her and, uh, you know, and I'm trying to help her the best I can, but, you know, I can only do so much and at some point she'll figure it out. She's, she's coming around pretty good right now. I think she's, she's starting to like volunteer a little bit here and like get out, do

Speaker 1:          01:16:26       some stuff and, you know, I'm pretty, you know, I'm just, I'm just proud of her, you know, for the most part. Yeah. You know, that's one of the things that makes that transition so hard, um, is that, you know, before I was talking about like combat matters and then beyond that you're doing this thing, you know, for your wife, like she's in charge of saving people's lives, saving soldiers' lives, and that's going to help this strategic mission. I mean, what, what, what is going to replace that for her? And the answer, Alana, is nothing. Nothing's gonna replace that. Yeah, but you know what? You don't need to replace it. You need to replace it. A whole stock replace that thing. That's a beautiful, beautiful experience to have had in your life. But don't let it turn into a black hole, right? Like, like the black hole, the mass of a black hole is some insane number.

Speaker 1:          01:17:30       Just like the mass and the, and the power of this combat experience is the same thing. It's this super powerful experience, but don't let it suck all the other experiences away. Don't let it do that. Don't let it do that. So what's the, what's, what else? What matters? Now we know what mattered in the past, right? But what matters now. That's the question. And there's so many things. I mean, you got two daughters, you got your dumb ass to take care of and I am dumb. You can tell Ya. So what is it? What does it, one of those things that matters and what's the next mission she's going to find? Maybe she's to end up being a paramedic. Maybe she goes, you know, who knows? Maybe she'll end up being an artist. Maybe she'll end up having her own podcast. Maybe she'll end up being a painter. I Dunno. But what mattered in the past is awesome, but let's find out what matters now. Yup. And grab hold of that baby. Listened, listened to Jocko. Now hold on to that thing and let that thing grow. Yeah. Let that thing grow. Let that thing feed off of the past and bring something new, something bigger. Something that happening. Something that's happening now.

Speaker 1:          01:18:48       But that's my wife. Yeah. That's awesome. You should use the damn proud of her. I could see it on your face.

Speaker 2:          01:18:53       Like I don't have any decorations for saving. People yelled at either do I life, you know? Uh, and you know, and I think about what I, what I saw, I saw a lot of destruction, but honestly it was mostly the enemy, you know, that I caused and I'm like, it's easy to step over him. Like he doesn't look like me. He doesn't talk like me, doesn't dress like me. Like I don't even know that, you know, I didn't know nothing about that guy. Step over him, carry on, she rolls up, let's just take my case. She knows me. I'm Jodie, I'm her buddy. We watched a family guy together. I used to, you know her, her ex husband and I used to, we're, we're buddies, you know, like you know all these things in and she would, whenever she would roll up to a scene, it was the clean up the mess the enemy made of us. And she knew most. We're a tiny army. Yeah. And our, or were brick at brigade for us is like 3,200 guys, maybe, maybe, maybe 2,500 in 2006. So she knew most of the guys that she put into body bags or like in my case she says after they loaded me on the helicopter and it flew away, she was just sad because she knew that what I was going home to because of my injuries. Right. She was like, she knew

Speaker 1:          01:20:11       more about your future than you did. Exactly. She knew what a nightmare you were about.

Speaker 2:          01:20:16       Go through. She knew that what I was and who I was and what I was now going to be. They have to become an except and she says that she said that in an, she had never said that to me and I read it in an interview she gave once and she said, yeah, I just, I, I was just devastated for him because of what he was going to go home to. This big, tough, strong, proud guy had to go home without feet. She's just like, oh, and I guess she said something like, you know, if nobody else looks after him, I guess I gotta God dammit she did. Next question prompts to, Alana, you love your baby. Awesome.

Speaker 1:          01:20:58       Kind of a next question which I paired these two together because this one relates here. How do you deal with being away from family and loved ones?

Speaker 2:          01:21:09       Oh, I'm uh, I'm odd. I'll always have been. I think this might be where I might be a little bit like you. Do you ever like, I just, I don't really miss people. Yes. Does that make sense? Do you know what I'm saying? I know I can see it. Okay. You know I, I don't miss people cause I know I'm going to see them. Even my dog. I love my daughters, love my daughters and I'll walk in the house and they're better than puppies. Right. They jump on me and I get Daddy, Daddy, it's the seven year old's still does it. I get kisses, I get hugs. I get where were you? You were gone so long. But like today I haven't spoken to them and I don't miss him. I know that they're out there like, but on a, on a, on a certain level, when I do get home I'm real happy to be home.

Speaker 2:          01:22:02       Yeah. Like you were saying to me on the phone, like you just want to get home, but when I'm away from home you're in the game. Yes. Especially for this I guess cause I'm here to promote the book and I'm here to hang out with you guys. So I'm like, I'm looking forward. And it's like when my dad was crying in the parking lot before I went on my first mission ever. To me it was like, what's the big deal dude? I'll be back in six months and, and you know, my best, my best buddies, you know, the, the guys that I was happy didn't die in combat. I've talked to them every three to six months. You know, I just talked to the leader of that Green Brae team that I worked so much with just the other day after two years of not actually speaking. You know, a couple of messages on Facebook in this, it's weird for me.

Speaker 1:          01:22:52       Yeah. I'm very similar. I don't, I don't feel the need to continually update people or talk to people. And my best example is the guy went through seal training with did three platoons within that seal team, wasn't training cell with them at seal team one. And he was my roommate that entire time. So eight years or so we were, and we, we did everything together, drank together, hung out together, everything we did and I got, and then I got moved to Virginia Beach for two years. Didn't talk to him. Not One single time, not a letter, not a phone on a phone call, nothing came back. It's almost like, hey, what's up man? Oh yeah. Hey, you want a burger with us? You know what I mean? It was just like nothing to write up. Picked it right up. And that's how I always feel. So, um, and I kind of do that with my family, at least in it, you know, I'm assuming that this person is a guy that's um, thinking about being on deployment without his family.

Speaker 1:          01:23:45       And so, yeah. And again, when I talked about earlier is I'm going to compartmentalize and say it and I'll tell you this is, I didn't want to talk to my wife and kids every day at all when I was on deployment. I didn't want you could do it. I mean, if you were, if you were on base, you could do what I mean. For those of you that don't know overseas, most places overseas right now, you got Internet, you got satellite phone, you can call home. You can, I did not want to do that with my wife and with my family.

Speaker 2:          01:24:17       When was your first deployment? Uh, 2003 2004 that was your first one ever? Oh No, no, no. I, my first deployment was in 92 93 yeah, mine was a Kosovo 99 you called home on a w you had one phone [inaudible] it was seven second delay and you got 15 minutes a week. Maybe it was 42nd delay. I just know like it sucked. There was no such thing as email, email and 99 first of all, I didn't even have an email. Yeah. And so there's one guy on base who is the Geek and he would go back to the main camp where they had the Inter Inter web and you had to give them your email and the password and he would download your messages onto a CD Rom com back with it and print it off on the clerk's computer for you. I wonder if our type of thinking about it is, is a response from the fact that we just didn't have it the first time and then buy between 99 and 2006 and 2006 I had a sat phone in my pocket for every, everywhere I went.

Speaker 2:          01:25:21       I could have called home all day every day, but I didn't because I was like, well, first of all to treat. And second of all, I know a lot of work at a job to do and I can't be worrying about. I one time I was on the phone and a shot went over my head, Hey dad, I got to go. Hey, you know, when he's, and then I think, uh, um, your Guy Chris Kyle in his book, he talks about being on the phone and then a gunfight starts. Yeah. And his wife listens to the gunfight because you forgot to hang up the phone. Are you kidding me? Putting your family through that? But I think maybe our situation is that we came from the generation where that just wasn't an option anyway. So I would love to talk to some of the

Speaker 3:          01:26:03       newer guys. Yeah. About this, about this subject. Um, my, I did two, I did three shipboard deployments as a seal. So we used to deploy on ships. And the first one I went on the, we didn't have internet, so it was old school. You'd get mail, written mail, but that was the norm. Once every 30 days or 35 days, it'd be like mail call. Everyone would be all excited. But um, yeah, I think that that definitely conditions you to not be addicted to having that. And I don't think you're helping the home front either to call everyday and say, I miss you so much. I can't wait to, I don't know if it helps the home front either. I think it actually is a little bit painful for the Home Front. I was talking to one of the wives the other day of some of our guys that are deployed, don't get mad at me ladies, but I'm just saying a lot of ladies that are deployed tents.

Speaker 3:          01:26:54       That's true. But I was talking to a wife of a guy I know and she says, Hey, I haven't heard from so and so for, for like four days. I'm like, Huh? I'm like, he's probably on op. Like you know when he does for a living, you know exactly what he does for a living. OPS can take awhile. He's like, it's like, yeah, but usually he gets back to me and I'm like, obviously he's on a long up, but their condition now to always hear back from you. You know what you, you talked about this in your book, which is life's gonna go on. Yeah. And I think that that's something too that will help, you know, if you're like for this guy that's going to be gone for a long time and how's he going to deal with it except the fact that life's going to go on and just be cool with that.

Speaker 3:          01:27:40       Things are gonna change the things we can get remodeled. This is going to be some new rugs in the house. It's gonna be a new piece of furniture. The fridge might break and she'll go get a new one. Exactly. And there's nothing you can do both and you can just be cool with it. Yeah. If you don't like the color she picks, say thanks for getting the new fridge. Yeah. Thanks for taking care of that because I was busy doing protecting freedoms and democracy in the world. All right, next one. What are your workout slash training methods? I usually make it up as I'm walking into that. No. Okay. Um, right now because I am bodybuilding and I'm going like, I'm doing a, might be hearing from echo here in a second. He's the big time bodybuilder. Do you buddybuild no. No. Okay. So I've worked out since, you know, I was 16 with weights, right. But I always, so my first mission in Afghanistan, because I was a driver slash bodyguard and remember Animal Stak yes. Supplement, which was basically steroids. Yes. So we would order, we ordered a shit ton of animal stack and because we had a lot of downtime, we watched, um, you know, like 24 of the series on DVD and we worked out, I came home like bench benching, like whatever four plates aside is

Speaker 2:          01:29:02       dead lifting. Like I was like huge. We looked, looked awesome. What did you weigh to 40 or something crazy like that. And then I tried to get behind my sniper rifle because I was not operating as this neighbor. Right. And I was like, Oh God, okay. Two big tried, tried rucking through my rucksack on and tried to go up a hill. Oh my God. Oh yeah. So I had to slim back down. I've realized, I'm like, oh, being a meathead is not conducive to being a sniper. Um, so I always tried to tailor my body around being a sniper, especially after that. And, um, but now, uh, like I said, I'm going to be 40 in January. It's going to be 10 year anniversary of getting blown up in January. And I wanted to quit drinking and I needed a new goal to move towards.

Speaker 2:          01:29:49       So I said, I'm gonna get into bodybuilding and if you know anything about bodybuilding, I don't want to look like Phil Heath. I want to look like a Arnold when he was in the 70s, sixties, when they still look humans. So you picked a realistic goal. Yeah. Something, something where I might not need supplementation from another country. Um, and not that there's anything wrong with it. Whatever man of, to me, my, my view on that stuff is if it gets you to where you want to be and you're not hurting anybody, who cares, right. It's your body. Do whatever you want with it. Um, so, but, but for bodybuilding, you look good. So I'm doing the physique class, which means you wear board shorts and you don't necessarily have a routine, but they tell you how to pose. They like, I want to see your abs. We want to see your glutes, whatever, whatever.

Speaker 2:          01:30:38       So you kind of just stand a certain way and uh, and I take direction well, right. I'll be on the parade square basically. So you look good, but you're not really good for much know when you're in that condition. So I want the picture of me with a six pack. I'll be 40, I'll have a glass of water, it'll all go away. Um, and then I'll celebrate the 10 year anniversary of getting blown up and I'll at least I'll know that I've got like somewhat of the type of body I used to have back. Okay. All that being said, my training now is being directed by my buddy nick. And I do whatever he tells me. And right now its chest and arms one day back and shoulders and other day and legs and other day. Can you squat? No. How do you, what sucks? Because that was my favorite exercise of course, of course. Um, but there's gotta be some like modified, I do a hack squat. Okay. There, you know the machine. Yeah. So I recently discovered it, like in the last six weeks I, I discovered this machine hack squat, um, before I was doing leg press and, uh, curls. I can't really do extensions cause the, cause the stumps are different length and where the pad rests across my shins, it tweets too much torque on my stumps. So, but then I found this hack squat thing and it's, it's

Speaker 3:          01:32:00       made all the difference. So I, you know, slap as much weight on it as I can stand in and I just squat cause it's almost like a squat. Yeah, it's pretty close. But I'm supported so my wife's has noticed a firmer ass. There you go. Things like that, you know. And so anyway, my, my, my routine is just that and you know, the food is, I'm a big baby when it comes to food. Um, I've never eaten my vegetables and I don't care what nick says or what my mom used to say. I'm not going to eat him. That's what my food eats. Um, you know, I'm a meat and potatoes guy pretty much. Um, and that's about it. I have the worst eater of food, like fear factor with Joe Rogan's old show. I would be the worst contestant. I'll be such a low, well I might be able to pull it off because I've eaten some pretty gross things cause I had to write.

Speaker 3:          01:32:49       But um, like I just don't like a lot of foods. I'm the same. Yeah. And I don't care what anyone tells you. Oh come on. You just got to try it. I'm not, I'm not trying it. Yeah, I just smelled it. I want to throw up. I just looked at it. It's something I don't want my mouth. How about that? Okay. How about you just get me the steak without any spices or sauces on it. Like I asked for and the plain potato I want next to it and I'll follow some butter and some pepper on that bad boy. That sounds like a good, it's like that's what food tastes like and that's what I love. But you know, Atlanta makes fun of me cause my favorite ice cream is vanilla. I'm like, my life is exciting enough. I don't need no strawberry sprinkle bubblegum ice cream.

Speaker 3:          01:33:30       It's bringing my vanilla. Maybe a Brownie on the side. Yeah, I don't know. I, I, I do go with the mint chocolate chip milkshake, but Ooh, maybe release chocolates. What about what, so you just literally see your like steak and potatoes do you are, when you go to this bodybuilding yeah. You're gonna have to drop a bunch of fat. Yeah. So I'm dropping the fat. You got to do that by diet. That's diet. So what are you going to do? What do you know what Nick's going to put you on for a program for that? We start that next week. You think he's going to go like no carbs. All Fat. He's a proponent of the old school bodybuilding where you never want to be in Ketosis really? But he's a body builder. We're going to, I want to get them to re look at the physique stuff because you know, if you read Arnold's new update, more modern book on bodybuilding or Encyclopedia of bodybuilding, which he rewrote the nineties they still went by the whole fuel, the muscle with the carb thing.

Speaker 3:          01:34:27       Right. But they looked amazing. So they, they might have been onto something because you've got to think about we're on the juice. Well, Arnolds most of those guys and say in the 70s they weren't juice. Actually, you're completely wrong. Those guys were absolutely juicing 100% in the 70s, the 70s. Absolutely. And it wasn't even late today. Not like today, but Arnold was absolutely 100% on steroids as we're all those guys back in the day. And they weren't illegal yet, but they all spit in the book. He says he didn't really, they didn't really know what they were like, their affect, they knew they helped. Oh, but they didn't have it down to a science. You know what their effect was 27 inch arms or whatever. Yeah. They didn't have it to science, but they were taking, they were absolutely 100% on the sauce. Um, and it wasn't illegal at the time.

Speaker 3:          01:35:20       They know that. Yeah, that's right. So that might be where that idea comes from of hey, they weren't on anything. They were absolutely and on that. So completely yoked nick. Yeah, they did. It look pretty good. Pretty you, you said that earlier. They like, oh, you don't want to be natural like scores and Baker the 70s I they still looked human is my point. They looked more human than they do now. Mike, did you have you watched generation iron? Yeah. I mean what is now or just mutants. Yeah. And that's great. Good for them. Amazing. But I can't, I need to lose weight to be on prosthetics. Like I can't be putting on that kind of way. Yeah. So next thing is, um, could, ptosis is bad because you risk losing muscle mass and that's kind of counter to the whole body building thing. So transitional period, you do risk that if you're not in ketosis.

Speaker 3:          01:36:10       So there's the of, and it varies from person to person. Some people they go through, they switch over to ketosis right away. Yeah. And you know, the risk, you know, they don't, they don't lose out, but some guys it takes weeks and yeah. You as Muslim that, yeah. Like, I'm not that big yet at all, but I mean we're still, we've got till November and uh, as long as it's, you know, it'll probably be a protein heavy. Uh, with the normal curves, rice and potato, sweet potato, stuff like that. Like little bit of olive oil and coconut oil and stuff. You just go lots of fat. Pretty good amount of protein, no carbohydrates. The, yeah, no, sorry. But this is my thing. This is after the bodybuilding. Yes. That's how I eat anyway. I eat, I do love me some pasta though. And Atlanta and I will crush a pizza.

Speaker 3:          01:37:00       Like whoa. Oh yeah, that's our thing. Friday night we get a pizza, we rent a movie on iTunes. You know how to get the occasional pizza. It's understood. It's a taste good. Yeah. Yeah. Um, but occasional, yeah. But my, my general rule for myself is that it's usually a high protein, low carb diet. And if, and I like to eat, like if I'm not eating, I like to be taking like a shake or something, like every three or four hours or I just, you tried to intermittent fasting. Yes. Yeah. Have knocked that. Um, it's okay. I don't mind it. I like it as far as convenience goes, man, that's a convenient died. I'm not eating today. Yeah, I'm going to want more. And I, I don't, I did a, I did a 48 hour fast a little while ago, just out of randomness. Like one day I worked all day or traveled or something and I didn't eat.

Speaker 3:          01:37:49       And then the next morning I worked out right away and then I had a phone call and then I did something and I was like, Dang, it's been 24 hours, I'm just going to throw 48 on this thing. So I went 48 it was no facts could squat. So you have zero intake or do you have a zero or a drink of water? Just water. Drink water. And you know what? I did squats, roll Jujitsu both days. It was no factor. Okay. Yeah, I did. Um, I did a 48 hour, but I had coffee. Did you feel all right? Oh, it's fine. I feel fine. I like, I had a little bit of tightness forbid, but they whatever, like in the stomach. And I'll tell you once you read the forgotten Highlander or any of these books where I'm talking about these people that are just going months without food or they get the people up in North Korea eating, uh, what is it?

Speaker 3:          01:38:36       Route and salt water soup. That's your meal. God. Oh, we, we found some weeds out there. Do you ever have the dichotomy in your mind of if I was a caveman I'd be fine, but then you realize it's 2016 and why are you depriving yourself of something or why aren't you taking full advantage of the, of the technology available to you, whether it's protein shakes or, or, or supplements like on it. I feel like, you know what I mean? Yeah, yeah. I agree with you on those points, but a lot of people think that the benefits of 2016 are a twinkie, you know? Oh yeah, no, I was bag of potato chips or whatever. And that's picking my kids up from school yesterday and I was sitting in the office waiting for me to come down and then there's this young fella sitting over there by the next, the principal's office eating his lunch, I assume because he can't be trusted around other kids in lunch or so.

Speaker 3:          01:39:34       I don't know what the deal is and he pulled a twinkie out of his lunch. I almost fell over who gives their kid at twinkie at lunch. That's supposed to be Christmas, but when we be, when we, when I was a kid, I don't know about you. When I was a kid, oh, you're thirsty. Here's a coke. Oh, you're still thirsty. Here's another car. Oh, you're hungry. Potato chips. Like my mom would read the ingredients on stuff and be like, oh, there's way too much sugar in this shit. I got cocoa puffs for my birthday. My parents. Oh, I was, I was rice crispies and cornflakes the rest of the time. Yeah. Thank you, mom. Yeah, I was lucky charms. I mean, we just ate it and it wasn't like my parents said, oh, this might be bad. That was just what people bought. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:40:17       When I was a kid. Now my mom was on top of that stuff and I have that too. Like there's sugar in like a loaf of bread now I give my daughters as to slice sandwich, that's like 12 grams of sugar. If they eat the whole thing, I'm like, why is your sugar in the bread and and like I'll be, I'm not, I'm like an 80 20 guy, whatever that you know the 80% like 80 hours at a time. I pretty good 20% of the time I'm getting after some crap. Right. I'm a lot like that. And most of the time it's because like the other day I was, I was doing side was that film and I was traveling and it, it wasn't the Pretzel

Speaker 1:          01:40:54       wrapped hot dogs that we are all so fond of. It was, but I was legit hungry and I knew I was getting back early enough in San Diego that I was going to be able to get a workout in and train. So I had, you know, had like a milkshake end up double meat. Same, which have some guide where some random place in the airport.

Speaker 2:          01:41:17       Oh, the airport. [inaudible] dog. Yeah. Yeah. It was good. Milkshake airport milkshakes, milkshakes or tasting milkshakes are tasty. So do you make, do you make that kind of stuff at home though? To try and trick yourself? Makes what kind of stuff at home? So to trick myself into thinking I'm having a treat, right? I got, I get my Blendtec I'll put coconut milk in sugar-free cause you got to actually search for that one. You can't just, Oh anyway, so, uh, put my coconut milk in a, I throw in a couple scoops of protein. I throw in a couple of scoops of uh, organic sugar free peanut butter, which you got a search out again. Did you know they take the peanut oil at a peanut butter now? That's insane. Why did they do that? They sell it off and then they put the vegetable oil and so now you got to search out real peanut butter. Thanks. Thanks world. Anyway, so I put it in a couple of scoops of real peanut butter that I get to the bulk barn and I'm in a cup, a scoop of glutamine. But uh, when I, and then ice it, right. And then I spin it up and it's kind of like a shake, like a milkshake sent me the recipe. If it tastes good and I'll put a shot of espresso in often. And it just, it makes me feel like I'm having a treat. And so I'm like, oh, that's my sugar.

Speaker 1:          01:42:34       Her tooth satisfied for the morning or my tree is, my treat that I give to myself is a dark chocolate. And by dark I mean 85%. It's, it's almost bitter. Yeah. And I dip it directly into coconut oil, the Onnit coconut oil. I dip it right in there and scoop that in. And that is money. Yes. It's so good. So good. And the other thing about if you, if you and I, we like broke out some Hershey's bars here, milk chocolate, you take one bite, you want another bite immediately, you want another bite, immediately don't, but you do. And you do it. Yeah. You take, you take a couple of squares of 85% chocolate and it's like, it satisfies it and it doesn't make you go, oh, that was good. And it takes the, it gives you the satisfaction. It takes longer. That's my, that's my special chocolate I find as well. Don't find that it stays in your mouth along with the taste. It's just a little bit bitter. Get the dark chocolate, coconut oil. Coconut oil. Makes it a little bit, just makes it so by not heard this on your podcast. But I don't, I don't know

Speaker 2:          01:43:41       why coconut oil, by the way that I love on it, but use it on it before it was called on it. But they're cool. Coconut

Speaker 1:          01:43:47       oil. That's the one he does. It's the virgin coconut oil. Yeah. It's really

Speaker 2:          01:43:52       high quality coconut oil, which is what I do. And actually it's good too in supporting on it. I actually do support this podcast. Yeah. So, uh, whoever asked about nutrition, it's um, ah, you know, one thing I will, that was me that asked about nutrition wasn't that, no, the question was about working out. We kind of delved into nutrition. Okay. Well Jocko, um, the other thing, my guts got destroyed by the antibiotics in my recovery and it took me figuring it out on my own. Like why was I constantly having like, um, diarrhea. Why was ed constantly not like just an upset stomach? And then I started reading, okay, what causes it? Do I have IBS or blah blah blah. Oh No, I was on six months worth of, of antibiotics, killed everything in your gut. I've had staph infections like I wanted a year, one year Rad, like for staph infections and my stumps in a row.

Speaker 2:          01:44:50       And it just like just hand, you know, just hammers cause I was getting sick and like, so I'm like, what's wrong? And then I realize, oh okay. So now every morning I like, I keep a bottle of Kombucha in the fridge every morning. I just shake it up, take a Swig, have a probiotic pill that I take with that swig. And that's made a huge difference. And I'm always seeking out different ways to keep the, the, the gut flora happy, you know, so like apple cider vinegar, apple cider vinegar and Kombucha and the probiotics, those three additions, I've made a huge difference, uh, in my, in my system, Mike, my immune system alone. And then I like, I just started jack and massive amounts of vitamin D and C and in my body. Um, and then I've, I've kept a real close eye on like, so as a kid, like, you know, when we were eating lunch, I didn't want onions and mushrooms because as a kid I didn't like them and I found out later as an adult while I'm actually slightly allergic to them.

Speaker 2:          01:45:49       So whatever your body tells you, pay real close attention, you know, because nothing will screw with your gains are your workout routine more than feeling like shit. Right. And, and so if you eat something and you feel like shit after, you know, pay attention to that because that can take a lot of energy away from your workout and just from your date, you know, like you go roll into work with a headache because you ate something that you're actually allergic to, like that can really mess with your mood. So I pay super. So one of the reasons why I'm such a basic eater is cause I've learned that that's how I feel best and I function best when I have minimum sub like minimum, like additions to like, you know, when you, when you go to the get breakfast, right? Nothing better than bacon and eggs in the morning until they bring your home fries and they're covered with Paprika, Montreal spice shit all over them. And I'm like, why would you do that to my potatoes? Potatoes are delicious with a little bit of butter

Speaker 3:          01:46:50       and salt. All they come like that. Can I have some without it? Ooh. Yeah. Okay. You know what, keep it potatoes. Um, because I've learned that if I have that go in my system, I'll spend a good half hour on the can and that's time I don't can't afford, you know? So if anyone who's like, you know, when you're a big part of your routine is, is the fact that you have to have the energy and like just not feel like shit when you, when you go into the gym. Yeah. So that's why, by the way, just so everybody knows the probiotics and there's, there's bacteria in your stomach that's supposed to be there that's good for you. Yeah. And that's what Jody's talking about. That's why he drinks Kombucha. It has the probiotic. Right. Because it keeps those things alive. And what he was referring to earlier than that, that when you take antibiotics, yeah. It actually kills all that bacteria and then that makes your stomach not be able to, that's why they came out with the, um, the yogurt a few years ago, uh, whatever it was called, the dot. Yeah. And I don't know, there was that yogurt and they started selling it cause it'll replenish your, your good flora. Yeah. Whatever. Whatever. Yeah. Um,

Speaker 5:          01:48:07       all right.

Speaker 3:          01:48:09       A few more interwebs. We got one more question. Do you ever have doubts? If so, how do you handle them? Yeah, I talked about the doubt I had answering that second question. Um, if you don't have any doubt, I'm going to be real suspect of you as a person. So do we all have doubts? Hey folks, sorry to break it to your Jocko occasionally has doubts. He'll never admit it, right? But doubts are part of being human and it, if you're not doubting yourself, you're not challenging yourself either. I believe this. This is just what I think. So I try to approach my doubts head on unflinching you know, did I have doubt this third time I got sent into battle school? Yeah. Big Time. But put on the best uniform. Put on, you know, getting the best shape. Polish your boots to the highest standard. Be prepared to get shit on and, and, and bulldog your way through and smile while you're eating that shit sandwich. You know, like the doubt is,

Speaker 5:          01:49:37       yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:49:39       You ever heard that? Like you ever talked to someone and they talk about what they want, they really want to be doing. Okay. So I have a, I have a buddy of mine, he's a cop, but he really wants to t shirts

Speaker 2:          01:49:49       and he's like, ah, well, you know, I'm just waiting on, well there's, you know, there's a time, there's a time he even made a t shirt for me and he's probably going to listen to this and he knows who he is. And Bro, I told you this at the time. He said, Oh loud, let's sign a contract for 12 months and this, I'm like, you know, I don't, um, six months tops and you know, if that, and he's like, why? What's the matter? I'm like, well, I just, I just don't think you're going to, this is it, this is where your are. He's like, why? And I'm like, cause you're not putting the f like you're cop, you're not a t shirt cellar. And he see, you see, he's doubting himself to take that leap. You know? Did I have a doubt when I put my name in for the election? Hell yeah, I did. I've never had been a politician. I was a gunfighter. I was a sniper, but the ideal with doubt by dealing with the situation.

Speaker 2:          01:50:40       Does that make sense? Yeah. Because I want to know that I can a get through this, through it. And if I fail, I fail. It's, hey man, I fail all the time. I've failed a reading your book. You know, I failed Megan to the airport in time yesterday, but, and I have doubt all the time, but I also have enough confidence in myself that I'm willing to try almost anything. And I don't know if that's really the question that was asked, but the answer is the same because fear is the thing that holds you back from almost anything in your life. That was I nervous when I put my hand up to volunteer to go on sniper course. Hell yeah, I was, but where did I want to be? I wanted to be on sniper course. Um, it was, I nervous the first time I was in charge of a sniper team going into combat, but guess what? There was nowhere else I wanted to be. Um, doubt is your doubt. Is your mind telling you, you know, to think about the things you need to think about anyway, right? Like the doubt is there for a reason. It's a self preservation mechanism and you need to use that doubt to put the thoughts into your mind to visualize the successful outcome. Like we talked about earlier, visualization, you know, I picked your failure all the time and then I picked her. How will I deal with it?

Speaker 5:          01:52:04       Yeah, no doubt.

Speaker 2:          01:52:08       Doubt to me is just a question to ponder

Speaker 5:          01:52:11       and then move on, you know? So that's, that's how I do it.

Speaker 2:          01:52:18       I'm going to say for me, I agree that doubt is really how I know that I'm pushing myself into a zone that I'm not used to,

Speaker 5:          01:52:33       but like the enemy,

Speaker 2:          01:52:39       I respect my doubts. I'm not afraid of them, right? But I them

Speaker 4:          01:52:46       I'm going to watch them. I'm going to listen to them.

Speaker 1:          01:52:52       I'm going to understand my doubts,

Speaker 4:          01:52:57       but I'm not going to be afraid of them and I'm going to destroy them. I get chills when he talks like that

Speaker 5:          01:53:09       and I think that's

Speaker 1:          01:53:12       bout all we've got for tonight. Echo Charles, how can everybody just step on up and support this pod? Kashi, Bro. Huh?

Speaker 4:          01:53:25       Um, well there's a few ways as we were talking about earlier, if you want to do some Amazon shopping, click for a book called unflinching. Sure. Unflinching and what, what we do in this is no exception, is we all the books that we talk about, we list them on Jocko, podcast.com we have it listed, what kind of, what they're about and what episode they're from and stuff like that. There's a link on there. You Click on it, boom. You can buy for them. Right? That's the paper back. Write their paper. Ben. Also one of the coolest pictures ever taken of me.

Speaker 1:          01:53:56       Yeah, bitch. I was checking out your picture here and you have that little fun meter patch you had that thing pegged. Those of you that don't know, that weren't in the military. That was the one that guys were different. Random patches and some of them are, you know, proud historical patches of their unit. And some of them that if you get this, uh, if you, if you ordered the hardcover, it looks like that you can't see it. But on the soft cover you can see Jody's got the little and everybody in the military knows what this is a little fun meter patch and the fun meter is paved, meaning, oh, I'm having all kinds of fun here. Time. That's awesome. There they are,

Speaker 4:          01:54:30       a paperback hardcover. I like hardcover. Me. That's what I do. That's good. But yeah, do that. So I'll list Allen obviously. Oh, I can get through Amazon. And then if you guys like the shirts, discipline equals freedom.

Speaker 5:          01:54:46       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:54:46       And the one with Jack was hit on it because you want to, by the way, thanks. Know, get one of those if you want to support.

A lot of supplements not regulated. They can put anything they want in them and sell them to you. So get on it. Supplements my opinion. jacada.com/jocko Jocko, get you percent off. Get your shroom tech. I think shrink depending on what you're doing. If you're doing high intensity, sustained exercise, shroom tech, Alpha brain. If you want to think better and Krill oil, if you want your joints still hold up with the passage of time. Do they still have the shroom tick immune? Yes. Yes. I love that one there. You find that one good for when you're traveling, you are into on it. Even before. Yeah. I forget what it was called but Andre because he was on Rogan right like years ago before they started on it and he had these two supplements

Speaker 2:          01:55:44       because Andre used to like to party. Huh? Take out from that statement whatever you want. But that's what he, how he would put it in. He had a supplement called roll roll on I believe and it was meant to like roll onto the next day. Oh you take it when you're hung over. And I started, I ordered it and cause when, when I was very sluggish and all that from the stuff from my addiction and just, you know, the whole immune cell, like I would look in for anything. Yeah.
