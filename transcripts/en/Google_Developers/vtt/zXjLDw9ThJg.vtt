BILL LUAN: Shanghai
GDG is a very

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:14.845
interesting developer community.

00:00:14.845 --> 00:00:15.960
SUSANNAH RAUB: I'm
glad somebody

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.484
has asked this question.

00:00:17.484 --> 00:00:18.966
RETO MEIER: This is where
the magic happens.

00:00:18.966 --> 00:00:20.620
JENNY MURPHY: This is primarily
a question and

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:21.655
answer show, so if any
of you out there

00:00:21.655 --> 00:00:22.905
would like to ask questions.

00:00:29.302 --> 00:00:29.794
JOANNA SMITH: Hi.

00:00:29.794 --> 00:00:31.770
I'm Joanna.

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:32.890
GUS CLASS: And I'm Gus.

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.720
JOANNA SMITH: And we're here to
give you guys a demo on how

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.070
to use the Google Sign In button
in order to retrieve

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.260
profile data.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:40.070
GUS CLASS: Yup.

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.550
So I'm a developer advocate
on the Google+ team.

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.940
JOANNA SMITH: And I'm a
developer programs engineer.

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.040
GUS CLASS: And yeah,
this demo should

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.990
just take a few minutes.

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:49.340
And we're going to just kind
of show you how to retrieve

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.910
profile data that's stored
within Google+.

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:53.130
JOANNA SMITH: And if you have
any questions while you're

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.430
watching, go ahead and comment
on the YouTube livestream, or

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:56.740
the Google+ event.

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:00.930
And I'll be monitoring
that as we go along.

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:01.070
GUS CLASS: OK.

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:07.000
Without further ado, so here,
if we turn to my laptop, you

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.880
can see some HTML that
I've crafted here.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.420
And on the right side of the
screen is the actual website.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.240
So if you look at the HTML on
the left, it's just some real

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.280
basic, static content.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.540
And so what we're going
to do is we're going

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.540
to use client side.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.920
We're going to use the client
side flow, which you can see

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.070
at developers.googl
e.com/+/history, to actually

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.870
retrieve the information just
exclusively using JavaScript.

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:38.120
So the first thing that we
have to do is we need to

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.555
include the client library
for the +1 button.

00:01:40.555 --> 00:01:41.840
JOANNA SMITH: And like we said,
you can go ahead and

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.250
find this on our website.

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.430
And all of the instructions and
the URLs that you're going

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.910
to need are in the Getting
Started instructions for the

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:49.310
client side demo.

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.240
So don't worry about trying
to grab them off

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.490
of the screen shot.

00:01:55.894 --> 00:01:58.762
GUS CLASS: All right.

00:01:58.762 --> 00:01:59.250
Sorry.

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.990
Having a little trouble
typing here.

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.550
So here's the script for
including the +1 button.

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.330
And next, we're going to
actually insert some code down

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.256
here inside of this div
for the +1 button.

00:02:12.256 --> 00:02:13.890
JOANNA SMITH: Now when you say
+1 button, do you actually

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.080
mean the share button?

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.462
Or the Sign In button?

00:02:16.462 --> 00:02:17.750
GUS CLASS: Yeah, yeah, sorry.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.220
The Sign In button.

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.690
Yeah.

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.470
JOANNA SMITH: And what we're
doing right now is, when we

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.890
are marking out where the Sign
In button is going to go,

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.160
you'll notice that the client ID
and the callback are pretty

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.160
much empty.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.840
And we're going to be filling
those in as we go all through

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:30.840
the demo later on.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:31.360
GUS CLASS: Yep.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.030
So actually, the callback I've
already specified here.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.740
But it's a good time
to actually add it.

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:43.150
JOANNA SMITH: All right cool, so
let's create that function.

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.090
GUS CLASS: So this is just going
to be text JavaScript.

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.600
And then this function will
be called after the user's

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.040
authenticated with the
Sign In button.

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.500
JOANNA SMITH: And the callback
is pretty great.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.600
Because it's a really good way
for you as a developer to grab

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.550
data to see what your
users are doing.

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.610
And it kind of confirms that
the action has gone through

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:06.470
and everything.

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.240
GUS CLASS: Yep.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.040
So at this point, we've actually
got the script

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.700
included for the +1 button.

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.070
And actually, it's the
same that's used

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:16.240
for the Sign In button.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.840
And then we've got some markup
on the page for rendering the

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:19.460
Sign In button.

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:21.120
And now what we need
to do is we need to

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.110
create our client ID.

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.370
JOANNA SMITH: So go to your
Google APIs console, and this

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:25.740
is where you can create
a new ID if you've

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:26.680
never done one before.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:27.910
GUS CLASS: Yep.

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:33.280
And so I'll just call
this "Hello GDL."

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.240
JOANNA SMITH: Not quite
the world yet.

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.390
GUS CLASS: Yeah, not the world
yet, just you guys.

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:38.600
And I'll create this
new project.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.675
And when the project gets
created, the next thing that

00:03:40.675 --> 00:03:44.150
you need to do is you need
to turn on the APIs that

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:45.550
you want access to.

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:47.460
JOANNA SMITH: And there are
a lot of Google+ APIs.

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:48.900
But we're only going to
use the main one.

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.280
But if you ever want to delve
into the history API, the

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.170
Hangouts API, definitely feel
free to turn them on and

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.880
experiment.

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:54.610
GUS CLASS: Yep.

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.150
So here I'll just turn
on the Google+ API.

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.620
And then now turn on
for this project.

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.540
And I'll go over to API Access,
and then I'll create

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.380
an OAuth2 client ID.

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:05.610
JOANNA SMITH: This section,
this is your branding

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:06.110
information.

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:08.910
So this is exactly what is going
to come up when a user

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.300
is asked to grant access
to your application.

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.130
So definitely add your logo,
make the product name what you

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:15.810
want it to be.

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.290
But this is the best chance
for you to brand yourself.

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:22.029
GUS CLASS: And so I'll have to
set my site or hosting on

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:24.290
this, because it's a
client side flow.

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.580
The authentication is actually
performed by restricting

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.090
specific sites to being able to
access the resources that

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:33.340
are granted.

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.270
And so because I'm using the +1
button, I'm going to have

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:42.030
to add the +1 origin.

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:43.320
Because that's going
to be rendered

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.300
from within an iframe.

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:45.830
JOANNA SMITH: And you definitely
need to make sure

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.360
every origin is accounted for.

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.100
Otherwise, the authentication
won't propagate through.

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:51.470
GUS CLASS: Yep.

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:55.800
And so now that I have added all
these pieces, and I have

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:00.830
my client ID, I can put my
client ID back into the code

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:05.290
here for the client
ID on the button.

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:07.940
So now let's upload this.

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:09.030
You may not be able
to see this.

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:15.250
But I'm just going to be using
SFTP to put my script onto my

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:16.500
web server.

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:22.890
JOANNA SMITH: The other thing
is, as we do each stage we're

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:24.510
going to show you what
it looks like using

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:25.150
the developer tools.

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.070
So if you are a Chrome user,
you can right click and

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:29.860
Inspect Element to get
to any of these

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:31.960
consoles that we're using.

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:32.530
GUS CLASS: So it worked.

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:35.280
So now you can see the Sign
In button rendering.

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:36.260
JOANNA SMITH: Whoo hoo,
let's sign in.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:36.520
GUS CLASS: Let's sign in.

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:40.100
OK, so this is kind of what
the user is presented with

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:42.110
after they click Sign In.

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:44.720
Now let's look at that callback

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:45.880
from the Sign In function.

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.520
So the first thing that happens
when this callback is

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.250
called is--

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:51.585
[LAUGHS]

00:05:51.585 --> 00:05:52.840
JOANNA SMITH: Is I laugh.

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:54.460
And then--

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:58.290
GUS CLASS: So the callback
is called after access.

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:02.100
And then an access token is
passed inside of the event.

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:03.130
JOANNA SMITH: You don't
have to store this

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:04.680
access token yourself.

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.280
Only store it if you think
you're going to use it for

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:07.890
something else, like
we're going to do.

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:11.460
But the magic of Google OAuth is
that once a user grants you

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:14.930
access, as long as that access
is granted, until they revoke

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:18.300
it, your application will never
ask them a second time.

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:20.360
So only store it if you think
you really want to use it,

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.830
like we're going to do.

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:24.030
GUS CLASS: And I'll also log it
to the console so you guys

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:25.560
can kind of see what's
going on here.

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:27.540
JOANNA SMITH: What
it looks like.

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:29.230
GUS CLASS: And so now I've
stored my access token.

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:32.600
The next thing I'm going to do
is I'm going to get the user's

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:36.470
profile by using that
access token.

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:42.420
So I'm going to use an XML HTTP
request, which I'll just

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:45.490
abbreviate to XHR.

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:49.240
And this will have
to be set up.

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:51.430
JOANNA SMITH: So first we're
going to actually create the

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:52.360
XHR object.

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.600
But then what we're going to
do is add in a header that

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.860
includes the access token, so
that it'll automatically

00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:00.960
authenticate, or authorize, or
whatever you want to call it.

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:03.300
GUS CLASS: And so yeah, this
actually, just like visiting a

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:08.790
website, XHR pretty much is
going to simulate downloading

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:11.110
the content from a URL.

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:15.970
And then the resource that I'm
going to be getting is going

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:23.020
to be the Google APIs resource
for the plus.me scope.

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:25.410
JOANNA SMITH: So we're grabbing
everything that is

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:28.380
publicly available on
the user's profile.

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:30.890
And the reason that that is is
because even when a user

00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:33.570
grants you access, as an
application, you can still

00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:35.550
only get publicly
available data.

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:40.000
Because we fight for the user
and protect their privacy.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.650
GUS CLASS: So after
we open the URL--

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:45.190
sorry, my spacing is
a little funky--

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:56.640
we need to set that
request header.

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:59.250
And this is going to be the
authorization header.

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:00.570
JOANNA SMITH: And the bearer.

00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:01.840
GUS CLASS: Yes, yes.

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:04.540
Because we're going to be
sending a token, there's going

00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:07.150
to be a bearer for the token.

00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:08.990
JOANNA SMITH: One token
to rule them all.

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:09.330
GUS CLASS: Yes.

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:10.580
One token to rule them all.

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:15.500
So here we set the
access token.

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:19.400
And so this will enable the
client to actually get access

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:24.250
to those resources that we're
granted access to by the user.

00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:25.070
JOANNA SMITH: And the
final step is to

00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:26.240
actually send this request.

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:29.620
And then that'll actually
populate the profile data into

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:31.600
the request itself.

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:34.240
GUS CLASS: And so after it's
sent, the XHR object will have

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:36.049
an event that gets called.

00:08:36.049 --> 00:08:36.870
And it's on--

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:38.080
JOANNA SMITH: ReadyState
change?

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:41.200
GUS CLASS: On readyState
change.

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:43.584
And this is going to be
set as a function.

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:51.760
And the function will test
that readyState.

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:55.346
So the readyState--

00:08:55.346 --> 00:08:58.001
this is actually camel cased--

00:08:58.001 --> 00:08:59.960
if it's set to four,
that means that

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:01.090
the request is done.

00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:03.000
So if it's set to one of these
other values, like one, two,

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.440
or three, then it could
still be in process.

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:09.510
And the actual data is not
necessarily written to that

00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:10.250
XHR object.

00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:14.270
And so now that it's actually
set correctly, and the state

00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:17.580
is done, the request is done,
the user's profile data should

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:18.270
be in the response.

00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:20.060
JOANNA SMITH: And now
we can parse it.

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:22.810
GUS CLASS: So now I'm going
to take the profile.

00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:26.480
And I'm going to generate
it from the response.

00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:35.480
And it looks like I put
this in quotes.

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:36.730
JOANNA SMITH: Yeah.

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:38.670
GUS CLASS: OK.

00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:41.080
So now let's write
this to log.

00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:47.675
And let's see what the
profile looks like.

00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:52.140
Just copy it over
to my server.

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:56.490
JOANNA SMITH: And refresh
the page.

00:09:56.490 --> 00:09:58.210
GUS CLASS: Refresh the page.

00:09:58.210 --> 00:10:00.040
And this is where the
magic happens.

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:02.150
So now I'm going to
allow access.

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:03.315
And if everything went right--

00:10:03.315 --> 00:10:05.130
JOANNA SMITH: We'll be
able to see what's

00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:05.980
actually been stored.

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:06.460
GUS CLASS: Yep.

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:11.050
So it looks like I put in--

00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:13.600
JOANNA SMITH: So here's a free
lesson on debugging.

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:14.990
GUS CLASS: Yes.

00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:18.830
So what I've done is, actually,
I said profile.me.

00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:20.990
And it's actually people.me.

00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:22.730
So hopefully this scope
is correct.

00:10:26.276 --> 00:10:27.210
JOANNA SMITH: Is it?

00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:29.424
No.

00:10:29.424 --> 00:10:31.420
Oh, somebody commented
to let you know.

00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:33.410
Gerwin wants you to know
it was people/me.

00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:34.290
GUS CLASS: It is people/me.

00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:35.540
Thank you, Gerwin.

00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:37.470
You're the man.

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:39.180
JOANNA SMITH: So ideally, what
we would be able to see is,

00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:41.230
we're logging the callback.

00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:43.320
And then now we're logging
the profile data.

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:47.040
And so in a perfect and ideal
world, you'd be able to see

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:48.080
all the different fields
that we were

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:50.840
pulling from Gus's profile.

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:54.930
But right now, we're seeing Gus
in his coding zone, which

00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:55.200
is awesome.

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:56.930
GUS CLASS: In my coding
zone, yes.

00:10:56.930 --> 00:10:58.000
JOANNA SMITH: I get to see
a lot more of this

00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.250
than you guys do.

00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:04.260
You should see what he did
to my Keepon robot.

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
GUS CLASS: Oh, I'm sorry
about the Keepon.

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:09.870
We're going to keep working
on that, though.

00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:11.030
JOANNA SMITH: Once we revive
it, we'll make

00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:11.945
a demo out of it.

00:11:11.945 --> 00:11:13.195
GUS CLASS: Yep.

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:17.460
It looks like I'm requesting
the correct scope.

00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:19.920
Looks like I've got the
right client ID.

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:24.880
And I've got a valid callback.

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:27.570
And this looks good.

00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:29.710
Let's see.

00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:32.830
Also of note, you can see
that I'm logging the

00:11:32.830 --> 00:11:33.970
access token here.

00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:36.580
So I'm actually generating
a valid access token.

00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:37.950
JOANNA SMITH: Are you including
the correct access

00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:40.920
token when you create
your HTTP request?

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:43.120
GUS CLASS: Or maybe I've got
a typo that appeared in my

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:44.430
access token right here.

00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:46.430
JOANNA SMITH: That is
entirely possible.

00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:47.690
GUS CLASS: Found it.

00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:49.010
JOANNA SMITH: All right.

00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:51.010
So syntax matters.

00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:51.830
GUS CLASS: Syntax matters.

00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:54.310
Not only does syntax matter,
but actually when you fat

00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:56.840
finger all over your
variables, it does

00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:58.050
affect stuff too.

00:11:58.050 --> 00:12:01.020
So now hopefully
this will work.

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:03.250
And if we inspect
that element.

00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:04.150
Yay!

00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:05.540
JOANNA SMITH: So this
is what we really

00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:06.370
wanted to show you guys.

00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:07.890
GUS CLASS: Yeah, this is what we
really wanted to show you.

00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:09.350
This is kind of the
exciting stuff.

00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:10.670
I don't know if I can
make this bigger.

00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:14.670
But if you look in here,
you can see an object.

00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:18.000
And this is just the object that
was JSON response that

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.310
came back from the
Google endpoint.

00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:24.640
And here you can see the
various elements.

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:26.270
And so now what I'm going to
do is I'm going to render

00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:33.130
these elements to the area where
I'm currently displaying

00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:34.990
the Sign In button.

00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:36.870
JOANNA SMITH: So you
can preserve your

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:38.584
Sign In real estate.

00:12:38.584 --> 00:12:41.780
GUS CLASS: I'll just call this
function Update Display Area.

00:12:50.050 --> 00:12:54.350
And what this function is going
to do is it's going to

00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:57.870
take the object members.

00:12:57.870 --> 00:13:03.870
And it's going to write those
various numbers into that div.

00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:06.880
JOANNA SMITH: So first up,
let's grab a photo.

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:09.170
GUS CLASS: Yeah, so inside
of this object is

00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:11.700
the image URL piece.

00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:12.770
JOANNA SMITH: We're going to
show you guys a space even

00:13:12.770 --> 00:13:15.225
bigger than it already
is on your screen.

00:13:15.225 --> 00:13:16.590
GUS CLASS: I didn't even know
we were going to do that.

00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:16.890
JOANNA SMITH: Yeah.

00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:17.690
Change the size.

00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:19.530
GUS CLASS: All right, I'll
change the size.

00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:23.690
So yeah, actually, if you look
into the image object here,

00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:24.670
there's a URL.

00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:28.300
And at the end of this is this
sz parameter, which after

00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:29.970
playing with, I determined
you can actually

00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:31.320
make bigger or smaller.

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:33.200
JOANNA SMITH: Gus,
it means size.

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:35.320
GUS CLASS: Yes, in size.

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:38.870
So here's what I'm going to do,
is I'm going to create a

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:41.630
variable that will contain the
HTML that I'm going to be

00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:47.100
writing back to that div.

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:51.740
And so first, I set the source
parameter to the image URL.

00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:57.840
And then I'm actually, as Joanna
suggested, I'll add

00:13:57.840 --> 00:13:59.490
another zero to make
it really big.

00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:01.500
JOANNA SMITH: Yeah.

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:04.000
So you can all see what
is going on here.

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:10.805
GUS CLASS: So I'll label this
Content, and then--

00:14:10.805 --> 00:14:12.660
JOANNA SMITH: Then maybe we
should grab things like the

00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:15.342
tag line and your name.

00:14:15.342 --> 00:14:18.450
GUS CLASS: And it looks like
I forgot a closing quote.

00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:21.140
So the index actually contains
those, if you look on the left

00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:22.740
side here, these are
the indexes.

00:14:26.570 --> 00:14:28.080
And then I'm actually looking
at the index to

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:30.020
determine if it's the--

00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:31.205
JOANNA SMITH: One
that we want.

00:14:31.205 --> 00:14:32.850
Because we don't really want to
look at all of his public

00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:33.370
information.

00:14:33.370 --> 00:14:35.200
We only want to grab
the essence that is

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:37.520
Gus, so his tag line.

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:40.220
Because he's your friend.

00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:43.070
And we're going to store it with
the index first, and then

00:14:43.070 --> 00:14:45.590
the value of that index second
so that everything prints out

00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:46.210
nice and clean.

00:14:46.210 --> 00:14:53.290
GUS CLASS: We're going to
actually kind of search by

00:14:53.290 --> 00:14:56.600
incrementing through
the various members

00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:57.640
of this data structure.

00:14:57.640 --> 00:14:58.430
JOANNA SMITH: And just
grabbing the

00:14:58.430 --> 00:14:59.680
ones we care about.

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:03.860
GUS CLASS: And we'll
just do a couple.

00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:05.060
This will be the last one.

00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:07.031
JOANNA SMITH: OK.

00:15:07.031 --> 00:15:11.750
GUS CLASS: Tag line
and content.

00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:16.940
I'm going to pin to
content the actual

00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:18.290
member and the value.

00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:19.800
JOANNA SMITH: So we're going to
concatenate onto a single

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:21.990
string, and maybe even add a
new line so it's a clean

00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:23.240
concatenation.

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:29.420
GUS CLASS: And if I haven't
introduced any wonderful bugs

00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:32.530
here, you can just--

00:15:32.530 --> 00:15:32.950
JOANNA SMITH: The big if.

00:15:32.950 --> 00:15:35.725
Let's cross our fingers.

00:15:35.725 --> 00:15:37.370
GUS CLASS: It's hard
on camera, I swear.

00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:37.910
JOANNA SMITH: I know.

00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:38.800
And I'm mean to Gus.

00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:40.555
So don't think that this
is just on camera.

00:15:40.555 --> 00:15:41.560
It's my normal personality.

00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:42.950
GUS CLASS: Yeah, this
goes on all day.

00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:50.580
So I'll just set the inner
HTML to this content.

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:55.405
And it looks like I put it
one brace in too far.

00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:01.000
There we go.

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:06.410
Copy it back over.

00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:08.850
Reload.

00:16:08.850 --> 00:16:09.810
And do this.

00:16:09.810 --> 00:16:13.760
And yay, I actually have
an error again.

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:15.690
This will be easy, though.

00:16:15.690 --> 00:16:16.940
The hard part's done.

00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:22.210
Value is not defined.

00:16:22.210 --> 00:16:26.320
So if I go to line
31 here, index.

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:28.030
JOANNA SMITH: There we go.

00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:29.775
GUS CLASS: I wanted the value,
but I put in the index.

00:16:35.786 --> 00:16:38.090
OK, so now I sign in.

00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:38.680
And there it is.

00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:39.660
JOANNA SMITH: There's
his face.

00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:40.175
GUS CLASS: Voila.

00:16:40.175 --> 00:16:41.640
JOANNA SMITH: So this is what we
wanted to show you, how you

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:45.360
can grab this information and
use it within your own

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:49.630
website, or application, or
whatever you're trying to do.

00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:53.610
GUS CLASS: So that's pretty
much all I had to show.

00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:55.940
Feel free to ask questions that
you may have had about

00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:58.030
the demo or comments.

00:16:58.030 --> 00:16:59.615
JOANNA SMITH: And we're going
to hang out for just a few

00:16:59.615 --> 00:17:02.190
more minutes to see if any
questions show up.

00:17:02.190 --> 00:17:04.550
If you're watching this after
and not live, go ahead and

00:17:04.550 --> 00:17:05.550
feel free to stop watching.

00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:07.980
But for those of you with us
live, we're going to maybe

00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:12.119
concatenate some cats now as a
small entertainment while I

00:17:12.119 --> 00:17:14.058
look for comments.

00:17:14.058 --> 00:17:16.040
GUS CLASS: All right,
sounds good.

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:17.930
JOANNA SMITH: I'm going to say
hi back to whoever's saying hi

00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:19.180
to me on this comment.

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:26.540
GUS CLASS: I wonder how many
cats I should put in here.

00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:28.720
JOANNA SMITH: Uh, 50?

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:29.280
50 cats?

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:30.010
GUS CLASS: OK.

00:17:30.010 --> 00:17:30.935
50 cats.

00:17:30.935 --> 00:17:34.822
JOANNA SMITH: OK, 50 cats.

00:17:34.822 --> 00:17:36.690
GUS CLASS: Joanna, did you have
any questions that kind

00:17:36.690 --> 00:17:39.550
of came up?

00:17:39.550 --> 00:17:43.880
Anything that looked a
little questionable?

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:44.480
JOANNA SMITH: Questionable
questions?

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:48.150
GUS CLASS: Questionable
questions.

00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:52.920
JOANNA SMITH: I guess
no, I didn't.

00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:54.310
I didn't have any questions
right now.

00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:56.734
If I think of any, I'll
let you know.

00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:03.070
GUS CLASS: So we'll just do
some place kitten work.

00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:09.610
JOANNA SMITH: Maybe you could
name a few of the other things

00:18:09.610 --> 00:18:11.430
that you can do once you
have the OAuth token.

00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:13.162
Other things that
we can access.

00:18:13.162 --> 00:18:14.580
GUS CLASS: OK.

00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:16.100
JOANNA SMITH: Oh, there it is.

00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:19.060
Gerwin's asking, "would it be
possible to use the access

00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:24.760
token in combination with the
JavaScript client library?"

00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:26.030
GUS CLASS: Yes.

00:18:26.030 --> 00:18:29.090
Yes, the JavaScript client
library should allow you to

00:18:29.090 --> 00:18:32.590
use that access token
just as you would.

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:34.850
So you can actually set within
the client object.

00:18:34.850 --> 00:18:37.620
I don't have the specifics
for it.

00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:39.700
JOANNA SMITH: Is there a
sample on our website?

00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:42.530
GUS CLASS: There should be
samples that use this.

00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:49.610
And I will temper what I've
demonstrated here as kind of,

00:18:49.610 --> 00:18:53.500
this is really as much a demo
of what's possible, more so

00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:54.960
than, necessarily,
a best practice.

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:58.080
Because one thing that will
happen is after you've done

00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:00.250
this client side authentication,
that access

00:19:00.250 --> 00:19:01.640
token will expire.

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:03.950
It expires within about
60 minutes.

00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:05.880
And it's just something to be
aware of if you're going to

00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:07.645
try to replicate what
I've done here.

00:19:07.645 --> 00:19:10.330
JOANNA SMITH: But if it expires
in 60 minutes, then

00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:13.810
how do we also keep users from
having to log in again?

00:19:13.810 --> 00:19:15.860
GUS CLASS: Users will have
to log in again.

00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:18.960
But up until that point,
when they're no longer

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:21.640
authenticated, they
will not need to.

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:24.670
Just because by the actual
nature of how

00:19:24.670 --> 00:19:25.740
I coded this website--

00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:28.790
JOANNA SMITH: Oh, for
this website.

00:19:28.790 --> 00:19:30.760
GUS CLASS: The best practice
would actually, in this case,

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:33.130
would be to take a cookie and
then put the access token into

00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:34.140
that cookie.

00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:40.800
And then after that user comes
back in, you could check that

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:43.450
cookie to see if an access
token exists.

00:19:43.450 --> 00:19:45.490
And then you could actually use
that instead of actually

00:19:45.490 --> 00:19:47.660
requesting it and then
regenerating it.

00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:55.690
You'll also notice that when I
was actually going through and

00:19:55.690 --> 00:19:58.550
trying and trying and trying
again after I introduced some

00:19:58.550 --> 00:20:01.120
bugs, the authentication
dialog wasn't

00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:02.240
popping itself up again.

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:04.710
And that was because I'd already
granted this website

00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:07.240
access to my content.

00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:08.490
JOANNA SMITH: OK, OK.

00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:16.630
GUS CLASS: So all right, so
we'll play some kittens.

00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:18.710
JOANNA SMITH: For those of you
wondering about how to gain

00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:20.950
Google's [? log ?], you can
always buy it from the Google

00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:22.670
store online.

00:20:22.670 --> 00:20:25.060
Or you can try attending any of
our developer events that

00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:26.280
we hold around the world.

00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:29.310
And we'll be more than happy
to pass things out to you,

00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:31.175
since you're quite persistent
in your questioning.

00:20:37.210 --> 00:20:38.870
Let's see.

00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:39.520
GUS CLASS: Anything else?

00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:40.130
JOANNA SMITH: I don't
think so.

00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:42.746
Are the cats ready?

00:20:42.746 --> 00:20:45.320
GUS CLASS: I am never sure
if the cats are ready.

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:48.590
I guess it's time to let
the cat out of the bag.

00:20:48.590 --> 00:20:49.410
JOANNA SMITH: Awww.

00:20:49.410 --> 00:20:50.130
GUS CLASS: I know, yeah.

00:20:50.130 --> 00:20:50.490
JOANNA SMITH: That
one was bad.

00:20:50.490 --> 00:20:51.250
GUS CLASS: That was
really bad.

00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:52.390
JOANNA SMITH: That was worse
than my one token

00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:53.530
to rule them all.

00:20:53.530 --> 00:20:55.810
GUS CLASS: Yes.

00:20:55.810 --> 00:20:59.410
OK, that looks really bad.

00:20:59.410 --> 00:21:01.940
JOANNA SMITH: Well, normally
there could be cats there.

00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:03.492
GUS CLASS: There
could be cats.

00:21:03.492 --> 00:21:04.720
I know what I'm missing.

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:06.080
There we go.

00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:10.980
Good times.

00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:13.390
So yeah, feel free to
ask any questions.

00:21:13.390 --> 00:21:15.550
We're moderating both
the YouTube channel

00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:17.750
as well as the event.

00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:19.965
JOANNA SMITH: The
Google+ event.

00:21:19.965 --> 00:21:21.221
I'm trying to, anyway.

00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:27.670
GUS CLASS: I wish there was a
place dog, so you could get

00:21:27.670 --> 00:21:29.330
dogs as well.

00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:31.120
JOANNA SMITH: We were looking
for one earlier, so that we

00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:33.310
could be equal opportunity
pet lovers.

00:21:33.310 --> 00:21:35.660
But kittens are just much
more popular on the

00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:36.810
internet these days.

00:21:36.810 --> 00:21:39.510
GUS CLASS: Yeah, kittens are
really kind of more available

00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:41.100
if you really want to
donate some content.

00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:42.280
JOANNA SMITH: I think more
people just take pictures of

00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:42.950
their cats.

00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:44.910
But they go outside and
play with their dogs.

00:21:44.910 --> 00:21:48.280
GUS CLASS: Yeah, if we were
to draw a graph between

00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:51.380
camera-owning folks and
cat-owning folks, there'd be a

00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:52.230
tight correlation probably.

00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:53.820
JOANNA SMITH: Probably.

00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:56.620
GUS CLASS: Probably.

00:21:56.620 --> 00:21:58.320
JOANNA SMITH: All right, well
unless Gerwin has any more

00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:02.200
questions, I think that that
seems to be everything.

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:04.390
GUS CLASS: And Gerwin, I'll
remember that question you

00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:06.030
asked for the client library.

00:22:06.030 --> 00:22:08.480
And I'll see if we have any
sample code that we can

00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:10.120
actually demonstrate with it.

00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:13.690
And I'll definitely eat my foot,
too, if I'm actually

00:22:13.690 --> 00:22:14.760
wrong here.

00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:18.020
JOANNA SMITH: We're more
than happy to do that.

00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:19.670
All right, so I think that's
everything for today.

00:22:19.670 --> 00:22:21.490
And we hope to see you guys
again in two weeks.

00:22:21.490 --> 00:22:24.840
But definitely check out the
Google Developers Live for

00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:27.810
Google+ brought to you next
week by [? EMEA ?]

00:22:27.810 --> 00:22:28.630
from London.

00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:29.940
So have fun guys.
