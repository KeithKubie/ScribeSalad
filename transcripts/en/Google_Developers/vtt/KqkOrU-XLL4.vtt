00:00:06.104 --> 00:00:08.020
CHRISTINE KAESER-CHEN:
Good morning, everyone.

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:09.930
Welcome to Google.

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:13.200
I'm super excited to be here
and super excited to welcome you

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.430
here in Google.

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:16.260
And I'm here to
tell you a bit more

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.845
about how we're building for
more immersive virtual reality.

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:29.450
So I was born and raised in
China in a city called Chengdu.

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:33.410
And my mom used to work for
the state railway company.

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.630
So what that means
is when I was little

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:37.760
and I could travel
for almost free,

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.830
I traveled with her
on many train trips

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:41.780
all across the country.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.060
So I guess that's
when the travel

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:48.350
bug started to grow in me.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.260
And I went to Hong
Kong for university.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.200
I attended this beautiful school
called the Hong Kong University

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.612
of Science and Technology.

00:00:55.612 --> 00:00:57.320
You can see a picture
here on the screen.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.640
It's the second one.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.580
So the campus sits
right next to the ocean.

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:06.260
It has its own pier, had its
own beach, it was gorgeous.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.570
The experience in
Hong Kong not only

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.720
gave me the good foundation
of mathematics and computer

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.450
science, it also
opened the door for me

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.390
which has led to
the wider world.

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.510
So during my undergrad, I
spent a whole year, literally

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.960
a whole year studying,
working, and traveling

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.840
in the United States,
in the United Kingdom,

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.820
and in continental Europe.

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.610
During that time I went
to Northwestern University

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.300
near Chicago, and that's
where I met my husband.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.240
After undergrad I
moved to Switzerland.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.750
I went to ETH Zurich and
spent three years there

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.500
studying computer science, and
I loved every minute of it.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.480
And at the end of 2012, I
moved here to the Bay Area

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.020
and has been working at Google
for almost four years now.

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.780
So I love traveling, I love
cooking, I love the outdoors,

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.670
and I also love New York.

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.980
I just returned from a
six and a half week trip

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:10.210
with my husband
across South America.

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:13.960
There have been so many places
I've been that there's just

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.200
beautiful nature,
amazing wildlife,

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.270
and many extraordinary cultures.

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.410
So along our trip, there
have been many times

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.700
that I will stop at a point
and tell my husband that this

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.420
is gorgeous here.

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.170
I wish our family
could be here, or I

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.840
wish our friends could
see this, or I just

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.540
wish that people
could experience

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.740
what I'm experiencing
at that moment,

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.270
even though they were
not physically there.

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.780
So that is what has led
me to virtual reality.

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.550
The power of virtual
reality lies in

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:52.840
that everyone could travel as
far as their imagination takes

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.770
them.

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:56.570
The constraints
in the real world

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:58.970
will no longer be
the limiting factor

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.750
of what you can experience
in virtual reality,

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.700
and I find that super exciting.

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.350
I think there's so
much more we can

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:10.160
do to not just organize
the world's information,

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.860
but to gather the
world's experiences

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.620
and make them universally
accessible and useful.

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.450
So let me tell you a bit
more about Google's story

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.400
in virtual reality.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.480
Our journey started with
Google Cardboard in 2014.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.850
And that was a 20% project.

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.920
What that means was a bunch of
us, like around 15, 20 people--

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.410
I was lucky to be part of it--

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.560
we spent 20% of our
time, a few months,

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.990
and put together
Google Cardboard.

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:47.700
It was announced and
launched on Google I/O 2014.

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.460
And after the initial
success, the group of us

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:55.560
actually banded together and
started the VR team at Google.

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.330
It has been more than
two years since then.

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.590
And since then, we have
launched Google Cardboard V2,

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.450
which was 2015.

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.660
And last year, we announced
the much improved Daydream view

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:07.710
and controller system.

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.580
So a lot of what we do
in the VR team at Google

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.610
is focusing on how do we
make virtual reality more

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:19.839
accessible to more people?

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:21.420
How do we make it
easier for people

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:23.640
to share this experience?

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.760
And one central question
leading that way

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.820
is actually, what makes good VR?

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.870
Is it more resolution
on the screen?

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:33.990
Is it a wider field of view?

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.300
Is it maybe haptics feedback?

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.980
Or is it like spatial audio that
will go along with the visuals?

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.110
And the answer is all of them.

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:46.880
All of them are very important.

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.930
So here is actually
three examples

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:54.370
of the good elements that
would make for immersive VR.

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:56.770
The first one is probably
the most known one.

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.440
That is called motion
to photon latency.

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.560
What that means is a time
lag between the moment

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:07.000
I turn my head to the moment
the screen updates to reflect

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.830
the new view port.

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:10.690
There have been numerous
studies to suggest

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:14.920
that if the time lag is too
long, this may cause nausea

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:16.630
and this may cause
motion sickness.

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:20.800
And we don't want that to
happen to any of our users.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.720
And the second one is
also very interesting.

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.420
The second one means
the representation

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:27.460
of your body in
virtual reality should

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:31.080
match the pulse of your
body in the real reality.

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.230
So it is a very
interesting experiment.

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:35.650
You can close your
eyes and you can

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:37.870
try to touch your nose
with one of your fingers,

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:39.310
and you can still do it.

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:41.740
What that means
is our brain knows

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:44.730
approximately where
our body parts is,

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:46.930
even if our eyes are shut.

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:48.910
And what that implies
in virtual reality

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:51.370
is we need to
render, for example,

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:54.370
your hands in the approximately
correct location of where

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:58.300
your hands really are
in the real reality.

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.800
And then the last
thing is interaction.

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.700
That is probably the most
interesting of all here.

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:07.540
That means the ability of
users to actually make changes

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:09.670
to the virtual
reality environment,

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:13.000
and let the environment
respond to you.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.060
That will elevate
the user's feeling

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:20.460
to be an observer in the
virtual reality environment,

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:23.480
to a participant
in the environment.

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:25.630
So I had the
experience that once I

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:28.630
was watching a movie
in virtual reality,

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:31.300
and actually it was
kind of a game setting.

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:34.720
And there was a robot dog
that was coming to me in VR.

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:37.360
And of course, it's
not a real dog.

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.250
And I looked at
the dog and the dog

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:41.770
looked back at me into my eyes.

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:45.100
And I was like, wow,
I was really there.

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:47.505
So that is what makes
VR experience magical.

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:54.420
So the Google
Daydream team has been

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:57.170
working towards building
all these elements to make

00:06:57.170 --> 00:07:00.891
VR great, to make VR a
more immersive environment.

00:07:00.891 --> 00:07:02.640
I'd like to tell you
a bit more about what

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:04.930
my team is working on.

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:07.350
So after observing many
people spending time

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:10.320
in virtual reality, sometimes
even spending their first ever

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:12.930
time in virtual
reality, one question

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:15.300
popped up more often
than the others.

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:18.099
The question is,
where are my hands?

00:07:18.099 --> 00:07:19.890
We've seen many people,
the first ever time

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:22.600
they put on the headset,
they raise up their hands.

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:24.540
They will be like, oh,
I can't see my hands.

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:25.560
Where are my hands?

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:26.896
Where am I?

00:07:26.896 --> 00:07:29.280
And this is such an
important question

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:31.500
because hands are our
primary interaction

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:33.450
tools in the real reality.

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:36.240
And not being able
to see them or use

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:40.630
them is disorienting,
sometimes even confusing.

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:43.050
And on the contrary,
if we somehow

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:48.420
start visualize the hands in
VR, the power is just magical.

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:51.210
So there was once I was
trying a VR experience.

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:55.830
There was a virtual fireplace,
and I kind of put out my hand

00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:58.170
to be right above
the fire, and I

00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:00.420
start to feel warmth
in my hands even

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:03.880
though there is no real
fireplace below my hand.

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:07.090
And many people
reported the same thing.

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:09.880
So the group of us set out
to answer this question.

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:13.490
How do we bring hands to VR?

00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:15.590
This is a very hard
question, because

00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:17.330
from a image-based
approach, we can

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:20.720
collect a number of images
and videos and hand poses

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:22.080
and movement.

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:23.990
But if you look at
your hands, there's

00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:27.735
a lot of self occlusion,
there's a lot of articulation.

00:08:27.735 --> 00:08:30.110
And if you compare your hands
with your neighbor's hands,

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:32.990
you may notice that
the size and the shape

00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:35.679
will vary dramatically.

00:08:35.679 --> 00:08:37.970
And that means traditional
computer vision approaches

00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:40.730
normally don't work
very well here.

00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:42.490
But fortunately, the
recent advancement

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:46.340
in deep neural networks
provided us with a new way.

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:48.470
The power of neural
networks is that it

00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:51.200
can learn the
important features,

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:53.090
and then the depth
of the neural network

00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:57.980
means that it can model
very complex functions.

00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:03.240
And therefore, the neural
networks, once trained,

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:05.270
they have a good tendency
to be generalized

00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:10.440
very well across a wide
range of test data.

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:14.360
So we have built and trained a
neural network with TensorFlow.

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:18.380
And you can see a sneak peek of
what it can do on the animated

00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:20.210
images on the right.

00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:22.670
So you can see that not
only can you see your hands,

00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:24.272
we can track key points.

00:09:24.272 --> 00:09:25.730
Therefore we can
draw on the screen

00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:28.222
and can interact
with UI elements.

00:09:28.222 --> 00:09:29.930
And I'm super excited
that the TensorFlow

00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:31.650
team is here today as well.

00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:34.160
And they will give a
workshop this afternoon.

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:36.020
And if you're interested
in machine learning

00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:37.760
or artificial
intelligence, they both

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:41.000
have great documentation online,
and I suggest you check it out.

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:46.060
So what would you do with that?

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:48.610
What would you do with
having your hands in VR?

00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:52.000
I personally believe that
we can enable a number

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.740
of creative applications.

00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:56.920
For example, you can
paint, you can sculpt,

00:09:56.920 --> 00:10:01.360
you can make potteries, but it
can also give you super powers.

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:03.640
Perhaps all of us
can be Yoda in VR

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:06.340
with our own
virtual superpowers.

00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:08.684
So the question is,
what would you do?

00:10:08.684 --> 00:10:10.600
What would you like to
see in virtual reality?

00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:17.140
I'm super proud to be
here to actually tell you

00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:19.160
the hard work done
by these people.

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:21.430
What I just told you is
not my accomplishment,

00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:23.530
but the accomplishment
of the whole team.

00:10:23.530 --> 00:10:26.380
I'm super honored to be working
alongside with these very

00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:28.090
talented people.

00:10:28.090 --> 00:10:31.550
And with that, I'd like to
thank you all for being here.

00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:34.420
And I hope you enjoy
the rest of the event.

00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:35.260
Thank you.

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:36.460
[APPLAUSE]

00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:40.110
