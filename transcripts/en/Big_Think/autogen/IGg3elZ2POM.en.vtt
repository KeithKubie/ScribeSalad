we definitely are suffering from an
 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.270
we definitely are suffering from an
information overload but I believe that

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280
information overload but I believe that
 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.470
information overload but I believe that
there's going to be better and better

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:20.480
there's going to be better and better
 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.530
there's going to be better and better
ways of organizing that information and

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:22.540
ways of organizing that information and
 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.690
ways of organizing that information and
processing it so so that it's it will

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700
processing it so so that it's it will
 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.250

and the stuff you can do with imaging

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670
and the stuff you can do with imaging
 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.210
and the stuff you can do with imaging
and I just think that technology and

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220
and I just think that technology and
 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.610
and I just think that technology and
information is it's overwhelming at the

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620
information is it's overwhelming at the
 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:25.750
information is it's overwhelming at the
moment but I think it's really going to

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760
moment but I think it's really going to
 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.940
moment but I think it's really going to
have a major it's really going to make

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950
have a major it's really going to make
 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:33.680
