00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.240
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:09.000
&gt;&gt; Joe Yonan: I'm happy
today to introduce one

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.780
of my favorite food writers,
Adam Gopnik although, you know,

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.500
I have to confess that only we food
focused people refer to him only

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.250
as a food writer because he has
written about so many subjects.

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.500
It just so happens that I
guess I'm not nearly as much

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.320 position:56%
of a Renaissance man as he or maybe
I just have a shorter attention span

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.510 position:56%
because I find myself quite happily
occupied solely by his food writing.

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:35.280
And since we are here in the
food room that's what I'm going

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.070
to focus on here.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.790
Adam has been writing for
the New Yorker since 1986

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.810
and he's perhaps best known for
his work concentrating on France

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:45.590
where he lived for
many years and about

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.130
which he has written
extensively most recently

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:50.930
in the book The Table
Comes First, Family,

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.840
France and the Meaning of Food.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.980
Adam thinks deeply about
food I think it's safe to say

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.340
and even better for his readers he
expresses his thoughts about food

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:08.220
with a rare combination of wit,
sensitivity, emotion and logic.

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.340
Here are a few lines from
The Table Comes First

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.000
that might give you an idea
if you don't have one already

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.030
about the way Adam thinks
and writes about food.

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.640
We shouldn't intellectualize
food he writes

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.120
because that makes it too remote
from our sensory pleasures,

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.100
but we ought to talk as
intelligently as we can about it

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.390
because otherwise it makes our
sensory pleasures too remote

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:30.990
from our minds.

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.620
The knowledge that
our senses are part

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.060
of our intelligence is
what makes us human.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.440
We alone know our fun.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.040
The sweetness in our
morning coffee is

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.350
at once a feeling,
an idea and a memory.

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.510
Ladies and gentlemen, please
welcome to the stage Adam Gopnik.

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:51.100
[ Applause ]

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:52.780
&gt;&gt; Adam Gopnik: Thank you, Joe.

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.080
What a nice intro.

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.380
Thank you.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.680
What a nice introduction.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.150
Thank you so much for that.

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:05.530
I thought I would start off our
conversation by telling you a story

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.560
about food if I might,
about how food changes

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.310 position:56%
in a marriage, how food affects you.

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.480
One of the fascinating
things about food is

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.550
that we have this natural
capacity to make every mouth taste

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.120
that we experience
into a moral taste.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.810
Whatever we're eating we don't
just eat and enjoy or eat and treat

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.310
with disgust even we
immediately make it

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.230
into some kind of moral principle.

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:34.990
God reasons this way, right?

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:39.100
God once had bacon and he said I
hate that so nobody is ever going

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.950
to eat that who is one
of my chosen people.

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:47.680
We moralize about food as
naturally as we ingest it.

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.630
And one of the ways you see that,
one of the places where you see

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:55.920
that I've always thought most
clearly is in long marriages.

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.220
Marriages.

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.860
Every good marriage has an
argument in it about food.

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.980
Have you ever, you surely
have noticed this, right?

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.590
And it's always the same
argument over and over again.

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.770
I had my Uncle Ron and
my Aunt Rose who lived

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:15.060
like all elderly Jewish
people in Florida.

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.590
It's a law they were sent
there at a certain point.

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.280
Always had the same argument
for as long as I knew them

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.580
and the argument was that
my Uncle Ron would say

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.120
that they charge you
more in restaurants,

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.780
they give you large portions
in restaurants in order

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.250
to charge you more and my Aunt
Rose would always say they have

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:36.710
to charge you more in restaurants

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:39.060
because they give you
such large portions.

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.090
And they carried on this
argument for at least 60 years

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.930 position:56%
that I was aware of and are probably
still arguing about it in heaven

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.340
and even tragically after Uncle Ron
lost his vocal chords he would just

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.750
say it in a high voice.

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.550
They charge you, they give you
big portions because they want

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:57.490
to charge you more, Rose.

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:58.790
And she would come back at him.

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.320
Every, every marriage like my
parents are devoted to food.

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:07.010 position:56%
My mother, some of you may have read
I wrote a piece about cooking bread

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.390
with my mother a couple
of years ago.

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:11.420
It's not in the book, it's
not in The Table Comes First,

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.830
but I'll put it in some
other book someday.

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:16.740
And that was where we sort

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:20.020
of discovered each other
was in the kitchen.

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:23.490
My mother taught me how
to cook when I was a boy.

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:28.480
I had 5 sisters if you can imagine,
and but she it was more important

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.010
for the boys in the family to
learn to cook than the girls.

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:36.010
So I learned to cook with my mother
and she's a fantastic cook, but she

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:39.550
and my father have had the
same quarrel for as long

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.220
as I can remember and that is

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.760
about how many desserts
she is serving him.

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.630
They have just celebrated their
60th wedding anniversary too

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:49.230
and they are still
having the same quarrel.

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:52.900
He says, Myrna, please don't give
me 3 desserts tonight and she does

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.980
and then they just go right back
into the same thing the next night.

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:02.620
I've been married for a little
while and my wife, Martha,

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.270
and I have always had
the same argument,

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:09.240
but our argument doesn't turn
around why they charge your more

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.720
in restaurants or about questions

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:14.150
of being given an over
abundance of food.

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:19.020
Our argument is always about
one subject and it's about,

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.770
some of you I'm sure have
had this argument too it's

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:25.970
about rare and well-done meat.

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:29.550
I come from a rare family
and my wife, Martha,

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:34.430
who is of Icelandic descent, comes
from a very well-done family.

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:38.890
[Laughter] And when you're
first courting someone,

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:41.270
when you're first going out
with them and you're first going

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:42.570
to restaurants with them

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:47.210
and you don't quite
believe what you're hearing.

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:48.510
You don't.

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:54.000
When somebody says well-done on a
first date, you assume it's a joke.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.360
[Laughter] You assume
it's an affectation

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.080
that someone is putting on.

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.670
Beautiful girl and she's saying she
wants something well-done you just

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:02.920 position:56%
assume she doesn't really mean that.

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:05.880
She's just saying that because
she thinks it's compelling,

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:07.290
it's winning.

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:09.750
And then you go and you meet
her family and you discover

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:15.170
that there are entire families,
clans, races of the well-done.

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:17.470
And it's totally shocking to you.

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:22.750
And I would go for a cookout in
her, at her family's little house

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:26.790
in the suburbs of Montreal
where I grew up, met her,

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:29.990
and her father would have
a hamburger on the grill

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:35.960
and he would leave it there and
leave it there and leave it there

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:40.100
and days were going by and
nobody would remove this

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:43.910
and that's the way they liked
it because that mouth taste

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:47.190
for well-done was a moral
taste in that family.

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:50.540
It showed your distance
from your peasant roots

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:52.240
and showed your distance
from the farm.

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:54.990
They all came from families
of Icelandic farmers

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:59.640
and that showed how far you'd come
from actually knowing the animal

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:03.260
on a first-name basis because
it had been totally transformed

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:06.300
into a bloodless object
at the end of it.

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:10.050
My family on the other hand
was a very rare family exactly

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:13.470
because for them it was a form

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:17.080
of rejecting the taste
of their parents, right?

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:20.210
Because they, I come from
a Jewish family obviously

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:25.620
and their parents liked highly
koshered overcooked meat.

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:28.020
When my great grandmother
would have you over for dinner,

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:29.480
she would really have
you over for dinner.

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:31.220
You would sit in the kitchen
and she would put food

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:34.010
on your plate and then
leave the room.

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:36.800
It was always hugely well-done.

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:40.640
So my parents took on
the manner of the rare.

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:42.520 position:56%
They liked anything that was bloody.

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:46.490
It was a sign of their
assimilation into Europe,

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:51.630
their osmosis into France,
their having an entirely new set

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:56.440
of Bohemian and transgressive
values that included the power

00:07:56.440 --> 00:08:01.790
and the imagery of spurting
blood from your dinner.

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:10.330
So this was a very deep quarrel,
very deep difference that Martha

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:14.800 position:56%
and I took through life and you know
as it is when you have those kinds

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:19.450
of tastes, you don't begin by
crediting that they're serious

00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:23.040
and then you're always sure that
the other person can reform.

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:26.300
You're always sure that the
other person will change,

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:29.470
and I was always sure
that if only I was cooking

00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:31.930
for her she would get better.

00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:34.950
And we got married and moved
to New York and I discovered

00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:37.650
that she was never
going to get better.

00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:40.250
She always liked things well-done.

00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:45.610
So then we had children and it
carried on, and we became a kind

00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:51.750
of family rift in as much as she
enlisted the children on her side

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:55.860
of this divide, and I realized,
of course, after a certain time

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:58.850
as I'm sure all of you have
realized since I raised the subject

00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:01.650
that essentially what's
involved in questions of rare

00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:05.760
and well-done is sexual rejection.

00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:11.510
[Laughter] That's obviously
what underlies it.

00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:15.530
One offers your wife something that
is pink and bloody and engorged

00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:21.010
and she says no and the
content couldn't be clearer,

00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:23.680
the moral content of that choice.

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:31.410
But one day not too long ago I was,
it was actually a while ago now

00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:35.230
that I think about it because
the kids small, I was doing tuna.

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:38.120
I was doing tuna au Poivre,
you know, where you do tuna

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:42.160
in the same way the French do steak
au Poivre, it's a delicious thing,

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:43.930
and of course, as all of you

00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:49.210
in this hall will agree tuna
can only be served rare.

00:09:49.210 --> 00:09:53.440
[Laughter] Tuna that is not served
rare is not tuna it is tuna fish.

00:09:53.440 --> 00:10:00.200
[Laughter] And you recall tuna fish
a totally different gustatory world

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:01.500
than tuna, right?

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:04.100
It comes in a can and you
slice it on a diagonal,

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:07.410
on toast with mayonnaise.

00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:10.140
Tuna has got to be cooked rare
so I did my tuna au Poivre

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:15.940 position:56%
and I served it rare and my wife
cut into it and I could see the look

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:20.950 position:56%
of dismay on her face and I could
see our beautiful children mirroring

00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:27.720
the look of dismay on her face,
and it cut me to the quick.

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:34.450
It involved sexual rejection,
familial sides taking,

00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:38.280
a belief somehow that my
understanding of everything

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:42.510
that tuna should be was inadequate
to the measure of their appetites.

00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:44.630
It was a disaster.

00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:48.810
And I did what I have never done
in my 30 years of married life,

00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:52.790
I actually got up from the
table and like a husband

00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:58.600
in an old 1960s era television
show I made for the door.

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:01.180
Grabbed my coat and
made for the door.

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:05.010
And my wife, Martha,
intercepted me at the door

00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:07.100
and we all know those moments
even though you know you're going

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:10.370
to be coming back we all know
that there are certain trusts,

00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:12.830
certain bonds that
when you break you know

00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:17.820
that they never ever are going
to be remended completely,

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:20.110
never going to be completely
rewoven, and we were at one

00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:23.260
of those moments and Martha
intercepted me at the door

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:26.420
and she said you are coming
back and you are going

00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:28.010
to finish cooking that fish.

00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:29.310
[Laughter]

00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:34.580
And I did.

00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:37.580
I knew that I had to.

00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:40.370
I knew that the ultimate
moral taste that was at stake

00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:43.910
with that mouth taste was the
continuation of our family.

00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:49.460
And I went back and I put the tuna
back on the, in the cast iron pan

00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:51.580
and I finished cooking it.

00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:54.700
But in any marriage that works well

00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:57.490
at all there's a natural
give and take.

00:11:57.490 --> 00:12:01.350
Martha had won that
confrontation and rightly so,

00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:07.900 position:56%
but I began to notice in the weeks
and months that followed that moment

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:15.200
at the doorway that Martha eased
her way into a new vocabulary

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:21.190
and it was rooted in a single
beautiful word, medium.

00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:22.490
[Laughter] Medium.

00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:24.920
She began to say in
restaurants now I swear medium

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:27.620
and the beautiful thing about
medium is that it shades

00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:30.400
over beautifully either into rare

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:33.520
or into well-done and
no one can complain.

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:37.260
You can say medium
well or medium rare

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:40.980
and you don't really get the moral
indignation of the other side

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:44.530
of the table because the
official declaration is medium

00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:48.270
and the secondary declaration
doesn't really matter as much.

00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:52.130
She moved all the way to
medium just to placate me.

00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:56.810
And I began doing something else
as the cook of the family instead

00:12:56.810 --> 00:13:01.600 position:56%
of continuing to saute because I
saw that that's where the crisis was

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:05.250
in our marriage it was in the
act of frying and sauteing

00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:11.020 position:56%
which presents you irrevocably with
the challenge of rare and well-done,

00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:14.180
I began to braise everything.

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:20.180 position:56%
[Laughter] I began to braise and
stew the family dinner over and over

00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:22.410
because when you're
braising and stewing,

00:13:22.410 --> 00:13:27.210
rare and well-done never
come to mind as categories.

00:13:27.210 --> 00:13:33.010
Instead you're presented with a
simpler category tough or tender.

00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:38.150
[Laughter] And if rare and
well-done are the moral symbols

00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:43.230
of those first years of marriage,
the bloody and it's rejection,

00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:48.560
tough and tender are inevitably the
moral resting places of marriages

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:52.230
in their third and fourth
decades as they go on.

00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:54.190
All you want is for
things between you

00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:58.460
to be tender as they
can possibly be.

00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:06.090
And so between those two simple
linguistic declarations medium

00:14:06.090 --> 00:14:12.520
and braised to a tender touch
our marriage has survived

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:16.850
and what I think I've learned
from that process and from

00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:23.570
that transaction is that my
Uncle Ron and my Aunt Ruth were

00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:28.560
onto something, my Aunt Rose,
were onto something that was real.

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:30.670
And that is that in a decent,

00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:38.280 position:56%
long surviving marriage the portions
always get bigger but you don't have

00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:41.310
to pay as much as you used to.

00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:42.690
So, thank you very much.

00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:44.510
That's a story about food.

00:14:44.510 --> 00:14:50.040
[ Applause ]

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:51.430
That's a story about
food and now let me,

00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:53.880
I want to have a conversation with
you but let me read you a couple

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:56.390
of things from this book of mine,

00:14:56.390 --> 00:14:58.090
which I haven't looked
at in a while.

00:14:58.090 --> 00:15:01.410
I had been writing about food as
Joe was saying for the New Yorker

00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:05.010
for a long time, but it was
sort of a sporadic enterprise.

00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:08.980
I would write, you know, we
do a food issue every year,

00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:11.450
and I was always enlisted
to write something.

00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:14.040
And I lived in France and
people assume that if you live

00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:18.540
in France you must be sort of a
gastronome rather you actually are

00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:20.980
or not, you know, if
they post you to Madrid,

00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:23.750
I don't think they expect you to
fight bulls, but if they post you

00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:28.350
to Paris, they expect you
to know a lot about food.

00:15:28.350 --> 00:15:30.410
And so I had all of these pieces

00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:34.900
and my publisher said you should
put these all together in a book

00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:36.660
and that would be a
good thing to do,

00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:40.070
but I don't like to
just put pieces together

00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:45.390
in a book unless I can moralize it,
unless I can aerate and amplify it

00:15:45.390 --> 00:15:50.040
with some thematic unity
beyond the subject matter.

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:51.340
So I was struggling to do it.

00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:52.640
I was struggling to do that.

00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:54.050
I was thinking what's
this really about?

00:15:54.050 --> 00:15:56.200
What's this book really
going to be about?

00:15:56.200 --> 00:16:01.380
And I stumbled on one of the most
astonishing letters I've ever read,

00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:04.190
and when I read that
letter I knew that that's

00:16:04.190 --> 00:16:06.530
where I would begin the book.

00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:08.200
So let me read it to you if I may.

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:12.380 position:56%
In the early, this begins the book,
in the early morning 6:40 precisely,

00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:18.240
of May 24, 1942, a young
professor of German resistant

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:21.100
who had taken the underground
name of Jacques Decour,

00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:23.840
his real name was Daniel
Decourdemanche,

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:27.350
and had taught before the war
at the Lycee Carnot in Paris,

00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:31.320
which is a fancy school,
wrote a letter to his parents.

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:34.480
You know that for the past two
months, Jacques Decour wrote,

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:37.810
I have been expecting what is
to happen to me this morning.

00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:41.120
So I have had the time
to prepare myself for it,

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:44.300
but since I have no religion
I have not given myself

00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:47.630
up to any meditation on death.

00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:49.640
Here are a few requests.

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:52.660
I was able to send a
word to the woman I love.

00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:56.770
If you see her, soon I hope,
give her your affection.

00:16:56.770 --> 00:16:58.810
This is my dearest wish.

00:16:58.810 --> 00:17:00.650
I also wish that you
could keep an eye

00:17:00.650 --> 00:17:02.730 position:56%
on her parents that need help badly.

00:17:02.730 --> 00:17:05.280
Give them the things that are
in my apartment and which belong

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:08.880
to their daughter; the volume
of the Pliad [phonetic],

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:11.320
the Fables of Lafontaine
and the menu

00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:17.930
of the inn [Speaking French]
the 5 pagan stones of the king.

00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:21.420
All these last days I have
thought a lot about the good meals

00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:24.210
that we should have
together when I was free.

00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:26.870
You will eat them without
me all the family together,

00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:29.110
but not sadly, please.

00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:31.250
I don't want your thoughts
to dwell on the food times

00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:35.040
that we might have had but on
those that we really have shared.

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:37.920
During those two months of
solitude without even anything

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:43.090
to read I have run over in my mind
all my travels, all my experiences,

00:17:43.090 --> 00:17:45.190
all the meals that I have eaten,

00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:47.140
I even composed the
outline of a novel.

00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:50.530
I had an excellent meal with
Sylvan [phonetic] on the 17th.

00:17:50.530 --> 00:17:52.690
I often think of it
with pleasure as well

00:17:52.690 --> 00:17:56.500
as of the New Year supper we
shared with Pierre and Renee.

00:17:56.500 --> 00:18:01.490
Questions of food you see have
taken on for me a great importance.

00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:03.970
And three hours later
what was going to happen

00:18:03.970 --> 00:18:06.370
to Decour what he references
happened to him he was shot

00:18:06.370 --> 00:18:09.260
by the Nazis in the
courtyard of the prison.

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:12.270
There he was in the last
hours of his life thinking

00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:14.840
about sending a menu from a
little inn near Versailles

00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:18.380
to his girlfriend's parents,
they must have eaten there once.

00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:21.660
His last thoughts turned
to his best loved meals.

00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:25.780
Of course he's nobly trying to
ease the horror for his parents,

00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:28.790
but he's also trying to
find something to hang onto.

00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:33.620
Questions of food, he says, you see
have taken on a great importance.

00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:37.740
And when I stumbled on that letter
by Jacques Decour in a collection

00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:40.260
of letters written
by French resistors,

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:44.240
I knew that I had found my
subject, which was really deeper

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:49.160
or in a way more far reaching
than just why we like to eat

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:52.660
but how is it the questions of
food take on great importance?

00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:56.830
How is it that culturally
and individually a man

00:18:56.830 --> 00:19:00.820
about to face the firing
squad finds solace and meaning

00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:06.720
in remembering the great meals he
shared and also finds a possibility

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:10.630
of continuing by passing
on that menu?

00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:16.760
It isn't simply or even primarily
I knew about gustatory pleasure.

00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:19.930
It isn't just about the
pleasure of filling your belly

00:19:19.930 --> 00:19:22.080
or delighting your tongue,

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:23.860
no something much more
was going on there.

00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:28.240
It was something about the
continuity of civilization

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:32.070
and in particular about the
continuity of French civilization

00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:34.820
but also something about the hearth

00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:38.430
and the fundamental
experience we all share.

00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:42.640
My wife, Martha, said just the
other day [inaudible] of sitting

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:44.890
down she said dinner
makes sense of the day.

00:19:44.890 --> 00:19:46.310
Dinner makes sense of the day.

00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:48.710 position:56%
I think that that's profoundly true.

00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:50.880
I was once, and I tell
the story in the book,

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:56.230
I was once interviewing the great
British chef Fergus Henderson.

00:19:56.230 --> 00:19:59.430
Does anyone know his wonderful
book, The Whole Beast?

00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:03.670
Fergus' theory of, is a carnivore
and he has a wonderful restaurant

00:20:03.670 --> 00:20:07.970
in London called St. John, but
it's a form of carnivorism that is

00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:12.680
so extreme that it really
resembles a kind of vegetarianism

00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:16.840 position:56%
because what Fergus believes is that
if you're going to eat any piece

00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:19.370
of a slaughtered beast
you are responsible

00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:20.740
for eating the entire thing.

00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:23.570
If you're going to eat
what he calls the fillet,

00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:27.200
you have to eat the kidneys
and the brains and the lungs

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:29.060
and the rest of the pig as well.

00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:32.850
That the ethical obligation
of the carnivore is to eat

00:20:32.850 --> 00:20:37.750
and enjoy the whole beast not
just select pieces of it chosen

00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:41.130
by squeamish and fastidious
consumers.

00:20:41.130 --> 00:20:42.750
Deeply believes that.

00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:46.100
It's a strange belief and a strange
restaurant and they serve squirrels

00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:49.090
on leaves and many other
things, but it's delicious

00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:51.170
and as I say it's ethically
enormously responsible.

00:20:51.170 --> 00:20:57.060
I was talking to Fergus once in
this interview, and he said to me

00:20:57.060 --> 00:20:59.980
with a kind of look of
wide-eyed indignation

00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:05.630 position:56%
that you only sometimes encounter in
life and almost always among people

00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:08.910
who have passion and
powerful, ethical convictions,

00:21:08.910 --> 00:21:11.750
he said to me you know I never
understand when I'm talking

00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:14.500
to a young couple and they
say we're getting married

00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:17.300
and we've bought a bed and
a sofa and I want to say

00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:19.630
to them what are you
doing with a bed?

00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:21.440
What possible use is a sofa?

00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:22.990
How can you buy a television?

00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:25.870
Don't you know the
table comes first?

00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:28.920
And I knew immediately what he
meant, and I knew immediately

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:32.670 position:56%
that that would be the title of this
book about Jacques-Decour's question

00:21:32.670 --> 00:21:35.680
about why questions of food
take on great importance.

00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:37.650
He meant that the table comes first

00:21:37.650 --> 00:21:43.050
because it's the one plausible raft
we can take down the river of life

00:21:43.050 --> 00:21:46.810
and return to and be restored by
evening after evening and week

00:21:46.810 --> 00:21:49.310
after week and year after year.

00:21:49.310 --> 00:21:53.420
So that was the subject that I
wanted to take for this book.

00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:56.730
I often say to my writing
students, I say often say

00:21:56.730 --> 00:22:01.950
but the one time I was ever
asked to write, to teach writing,

00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:08.380
that any interesting essay has
one object and another subject.

00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:09.680
Am I going too fast here?

00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:11.020
Is this okay?

00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:13.900
Good. Thank you.

00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:18.340
A good essay always has
an ostensible object

00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:20.630
and an actual subject.

00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:23.900
So if I'm writing about baking
bread, I'm really writing

00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:25.410
about my relationship
with my mother.

00:22:25.410 --> 00:22:28.590
Or if I'm writing about learning
to drive, I'm actually writing

00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:31.080
about my relationship
with my father and so on.

00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:34.520
We all do that and that's what
we all like in a good essay.

00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:37.550
So this book as a whole as a
collection of essays was going

00:22:37.550 --> 00:22:40.630
to have as its ostensible
object, food,

00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:44.070
but as its actual subject
the persistence

00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:48.180
of civilization in
its microcosmic form.

00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:55.030
The persistence of shared identity,
the possibility of passing on not

00:22:55.030 --> 00:23:00.100
as we experience it in the great
halls of literature and history,

00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:05.920
but as we experience it in the
daily minutiae of the dining table,

00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:09.100
and I wanted to see how those two
things could touch each other,

00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:13.510 position:56%
all the moments when the big,
official history of wars and battles

00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:16.660
and revolutions touched
the table and all the times

00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:22.090
when the table touched the big
history of wars and revolutions.

00:23:22.090 --> 00:23:25.390
And that's the subject I took
for myself and tried to explore

00:23:25.390 --> 00:23:28.690
and I tried to explore it
in a lot of different ways.

00:23:28.690 --> 00:23:31.590
I looked, for instance, in one
of the first chapters I looked

00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:34.060
at the invention of the
restaurant because I thought

00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:39.920
that was a particularly interesting
subject exactly because we think

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:44.390 position:56%
of the restaurant as being perpetual
and eternal thing who would have

00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:46.690 position:56%
to invent a restaurant to go eat in?

00:23:46.690 --> 00:23:49.290
It's like inventing a
bed to make love in.

00:23:49.290 --> 00:23:54.510
It's sort of self-evident the form
is determined by the appetite,

00:23:54.510 --> 00:23:56.600
but that turns out to
be not true at all.

00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:59.880
If you actually look at the
history of the restaurant

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:02.840
and how it came about, the
restaurant as we know it

00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:05.670
that is a place where you go and
you're given a menu and a variety

00:24:05.670 --> 00:24:10.070 position:56%
of choices where the kitchen is
usually hidden, a place that you use

00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:14.420
as a kind of arena of courtship
or of intimate business.

00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:17.850
In France, that has a very
specific starting date

00:24:17.850 --> 00:24:23.250
in the 1780s just before the French
Revolution in a specific location,

00:24:23.250 --> 00:24:24.550 position:56%
around the Palais-Royale [phonetic].

00:24:24.550 --> 00:24:26.730
I don't know if any of you
have spent time in Paris,

00:24:26.730 --> 00:24:30.620
but you know that's an
extraordinarily beautiful formal

00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:34.120
garden with an arcade
and buildings around it.

00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:36.920
The French Cultural Ministry
is there but in its day

00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:38.880
in the 18th Century
it was very close

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:41.630
to being essentially the
first mall, the first place

00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:44.760
where you had arcaded shops
including what were the first

00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:48.950 position:56%
restaurateurs, the first places that
sold a kind of restorative bouillon

00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:52.740
in highly healthy environment.

00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:57.520
That was the way that the first
restaurateurs sold their place not

00:24:57.520 --> 00:24:59.140
that this is a place
to come for courtship

00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:02.490
but this is a place to
come for your health.

00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:06.130
This is exactly the way they tell
gym memberships today, right?

00:25:06.130 --> 00:25:10.070
It's not about who you'll meet it's
about what you'll do for the good

00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:14.230 position:56%
of your body, it's a very basic kind
of con game that the world plays

00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:16.640 position:56%
and that's how the restaurant began.

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:17.940
[Laughter] So you have something

00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:20.210
with a very specific starting
point and, yes, indeed,

00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:23.080
it goes without saying that there
are many alternative traditions

00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:27.370
that resemble them [inaudible]
Asia and so on, but the restaurant

00:25:27.370 --> 00:25:29.360
as well know it, the
institution as we know it,

00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:33.290
begins at a particular place and it
involves this is exactly the moment

00:25:33.290 --> 00:25:38.410
when history touches the table,
it involves a whole new berth

00:25:38.410 --> 00:25:43.450
of culture, of pleasure
and conversation.

00:25:43.450 --> 00:25:46.330
Some of you if you've studied
history and philosophy know

00:25:46.330 --> 00:25:50.090
that the great German
philosopher, Jurgen Habermas,

00:25:50.090 --> 00:25:53.190
his very famous theory
of the French Revolution

00:25:53.190 --> 00:25:55.360
where he says it was
really made in the cafes,

00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:58.150
it was made by conversation
in the cafes.

00:25:58.150 --> 00:25:59.620
That's the foundation of it.

00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:04.460
People began exchanging
ideas in semi-private spaces

00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:09.240
and then they begin to become
dubious, doubtful, of authority.

00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:14.290
They have smaller cells,
smaller realms of verbal

00:26:14.290 --> 00:26:17.160
and political exchange and
that becomes kind of like

00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:19.710
with an atomic bond that's the fuse

00:26:19.710 --> 00:26:23.430
that sets off the big
bomb of social revolution.

00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:26.140
Well, in the same way, the
restaurant played a similar kind

00:26:26.140 --> 00:26:31.390
of role as part of this new
civilization of semi-private spaces

00:26:31.390 --> 00:26:33.760
where you could go
and find an identity

00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:38.630
that wasn't meekly assigned
only by your birth role,

00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:41.860
by the social status
you inherited at birth.

00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:46.060 position:56%
So it's an example early in the book
of how history touches the table

00:26:46.060 --> 00:26:50.020
and the table touches history,
but I was also interested

00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:55.840
by the other questions kind
of trying to test out the ways

00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:57.760
and the theories by which we live.

00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:00.320
So let me read you one more thing

00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:05.960
and then I'll open it
up to conversation.

00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:11.000
One of the things that I got
interested in as a question

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:15.290
of moral taste of a place where
mouth taste touches moral taste,

00:27:15.290 --> 00:27:17.680
is the whole question
of the localvoire,

00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:19.570
the whole question of local eating.

00:27:19.570 --> 00:27:23.020
I'm sure any of you who are
interested in food are interested

00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:25.260
in ethics know that that's one

00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:30.100
of the most potent movements
that's afoot in the food world.

00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:31.400
The idea that we should eat

00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:36.790
in a relatively narrow local food
shed thereby sparing the planet the

00:27:36.790 --> 00:27:42.340
pollution that comes with shipping
food over great distances but also

00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:45.810
on the grounds that it
creates a much more healthy

00:27:45.810 --> 00:27:49.620
and sustainable agricultural
environment nearby.

00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:54.860
So, being a New Yorker I had the
idea of seeing if our family,

00:27:54.860 --> 00:28:00.350
the four of us, could live for a
week only on things that were grown

00:28:00.350 --> 00:28:03.680
and raised in the boroughs
of New York City.

00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:06.870
Only things that came
from New York City.

00:28:06.870 --> 00:28:08.430
I'll read you a little
bit of that piece.

00:28:08.430 --> 00:28:10.420
It's called Near or Far.

00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:13.710
Twelve-thirty on a beautiful summer
day and the Chicken Committee

00:28:13.710 --> 00:28:17.130
of the City Chicken Project is
meeting at the Garden of Happiness

00:28:17.130 --> 00:28:19.660
in the Crotona neighborhood
of the Bronx.

00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:22.280
The Chicken Committee is
devoted to the proliferation

00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:26.150
of egg laying chickens in the outer
boroughs of New York giving hens

00:28:26.150 --> 00:28:30.160
to people and having them raise the
birds in community gardens and eat

00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:34.110
and even sell the eggs passing
on the gift as this is called

00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:37.540
in the project and thereby
gain experience of chickens,

00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:41.970
eggs and community or fowl,
food and fellowship as one

00:28:41.970 --> 00:28:45.530
of the more literative
minded organizers has said.

00:28:45.530 --> 00:28:48.650
It is the pet program of Just
Food, a small organization

00:28:48.650 --> 00:28:51.980
that is administered by a startling
young looking woman named Jackie

00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:55.870
Berger, who is silently
monitoring the proceedings.

00:28:55.870 --> 00:28:58.630
The Garden of Happiness is
a sunny community garden

00:28:58.630 --> 00:29:02.550
with vegetable plots, a
chicken co-op, a chicken coop.

00:29:02.550 --> 00:29:05.900
It's funny I read it as a New
Yorker as a chicken co-op.

00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:08.750
[Laughter] A chicken coop,
a corrugated tin shed

00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:10.390
and a few chairs beneath
a [inaudible]

00:29:10.390 --> 00:29:13.250
where the Chicken Committee
is meeting.

00:29:13.250 --> 00:29:16.430
The Chicken Committee is a lot
more committee than chicken.

00:29:16.430 --> 00:29:18.290
Its deliberations filled
with references

00:29:18.290 --> 00:29:23.230
to existing chicken situations and
pursuits of newer egg opportunities

00:29:23.230 --> 00:29:25.700
and the slightly skeptical
neighborhood of people have

00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:30.310
to be gently won over by the
carefully beaming professionals.

00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:32.630
It's like a long questionnaire,
you know,

00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:35.720
one of the neighborhood people says
about a form about to be handed

00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:38.540
out to potential chicken carers.

00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:41.330
Well, don't you think that
someone who isn't prepared to fill

00:29:41.330 --> 00:29:44.950
out a few questions is it don't you
have to question their commitment

00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:47.560
to caring for a chicken
over the winter?

00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:52.370
Yeah, I guess so, but it's a long
thing all of these questions.

00:29:52.370 --> 00:29:57.260
The Garden of Happiness has
the semi-magical ability common

00:29:57.260 --> 00:30:01.030
to any place in the city with trees
and plants and animals just a seed

00:30:01.030 --> 00:30:04.340
from the environment and become
what most of the world is most

00:30:04.340 --> 00:30:07.980
of the time a bit out in
the country somewhere.

00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:10.920
A hen in the coop starts clucking.

00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:12.220
A scruffy Pit Bull

00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:14.810
in the neighboring yard
begins to growl and then bark.

00:30:14.810 --> 00:30:20.040 position:56%
Undiscouraged the hen goes on
clucking and a second hen joins her.

00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:21.910
I have come to the Garden
of Happiness not only

00:30:21.910 --> 00:30:25.320
to see a New York City Chicken
Committee in operation but also

00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:28.290
to get myself a chicken to roast.

00:30:28.290 --> 00:30:31.130
This was why a few
moments later I was trying

00:30:31.130 --> 00:30:36.440
to arrange privately
for a hit on a fowl.

00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:38.640
Getting a chicken that has
been raised and slaughtered

00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:41.990
in New York City is harder
than it might seem with laws

00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:44.890
and bylaws entangling
the transaction.

00:30:44.890 --> 00:30:48.840 position:56%
I wanted to eat a chicken that had
been raised in the city and insiders

00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:51.590
who cannot be named said that
although the city chickens

00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:54.200
in the Bronx are raised
strictly for their eggs,

00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:57.360
in private a poultry whacking
could be arranged for a price.

00:30:57.360 --> 00:31:02.950
I had been set up with a chicken
keeper who I'll call Freddy.

00:31:04.370 --> 00:31:07.580
[Laughter] Looks like you got,
you know, chickens, I said,

00:31:07.580 --> 00:31:09.240
sidling up to him in what I imagine

00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:12.550
to be the best Washington
Square marijuana buying manner

00:31:12.550 --> 00:31:15.310
as we stared at the coop.

00:31:15.310 --> 00:31:17.840
Yeah. Long pause.

00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:22.800 position:56%
Euphemism I saw would get you only
so far in the poultry whacking game.

00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:24.920
I was wondering if maybe on Friday

00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:28.800
or Saturday you could get me
a chicken I said, you know,

00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:30.500
the kind that people can eat.

00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:34.760
I tried to give the words a
Soprano's like significance.

00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:38.740
Yeah. I understand, Freddy
said, not making eye contact.

00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:40.620
Another long silence.

00:31:40.620 --> 00:31:43.360
So, I took a deep breath.

00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:46.730
So, uhm, you think
there will be a chicken?

00:31:46.730 --> 00:31:49.640
After another pause he
said with exactly the kind

00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:56.330
of ominous serenity you
want in a hit man, why not?

00:31:56.330 --> 00:31:57.850
[Laughter] Come on Saturday.

00:31:57.850 --> 00:32:01.290
You be there, there
will be a chicken.

00:32:01.290 --> 00:32:04.280
I felt unreasonably
pleased with myself.

00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:08.500
The chicken was going to be hit
and I would pay for the action.

00:32:11.350 --> 00:32:15.040
I went back a week later.

00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:18.530
I had gone all over the
city of New York trying

00:32:18.530 --> 00:32:21.920
to find the few working farms
and there are a few, a couple,

00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:25.880
that were still there, and I was
told at one point, for instance,

00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:28.480
that they do, there's a farm
on Staten Island they do all

00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:33.780
of the fertilizing with
elephant dung from the Bronx Zoo

00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:36.290
and that you can taste the
tang of the elephant dung

00:32:36.290 --> 00:32:38.170
in the eggplants that they raise.

00:32:38.170 --> 00:32:41.850
I was delighted in telling my
children this though I suspected it

00:32:41.850 --> 00:32:46.100
is a urban legend that
they like to tell people

00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:48.750
like us who are shopping.

00:32:49.970 --> 00:32:53.460
With all of the good farm
vegetables on hand I decided

00:32:53.460 --> 00:32:55.330
to make Saturday dinner
the centerpiece

00:32:55.330 --> 00:32:59.130 position:56%
of our local eating moment featuring
one blow out meal of good things

00:32:59.130 --> 00:33:02.400
from around the boroughs, but
I was more than determined

00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:04.210
than ever to collect that chicken.

00:33:04.210 --> 00:33:07.920
I pulled up at the meeting
spot that Saturday I had chosen

00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:10.210
with Freddy near the
coop and there he was.

00:33:10.210 --> 00:33:17.510 position:56%
So, you go the chicken I said
looking at the sky in my sunglasses?

00:33:17.510 --> 00:33:19.560
Yeah, I got you the chicken.

00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:23.460
This one he said and pointed down
at one of the handsome whites.

00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:26.250
The chickens pecked and clucked.

00:33:26.250 --> 00:33:29.150
Oh, I said, well, I was
hoping you would, you know,

00:33:29.150 --> 00:33:31.860
make it ready for us to eat.

00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:35.950
For the first time in our
exchanges Freddy turned towards me.

00:33:35.950 --> 00:33:37.630
You want me to kill it he said?

00:33:37.630 --> 00:33:41.870
[Laughter] I don't know,
I can't kill my chickens.

00:33:41.870 --> 00:33:43.180
I raise them, I love them.

00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:46.260
I thought you wanted it, you
said you wanted a chicken.

00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:48.040
We looked at each other head on.

00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:49.770
It's like, that's like
all bloody and all.

00:33:49.770 --> 00:33:53.610
I don't do that he said with
apology and annoyance mixed.

00:33:53.610 --> 00:33:55.640
Then a little anger crept in.

00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:59.480
I thought you wanted a
chicken to raise not to kill.

00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:05.830
I concluded the piece after finally
we assembled our meal together

00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:08.740
and this is a case where,
again, the table touches I think

00:34:08.740 --> 00:34:17.040
on the biggest questions we ask
ourselves that the arguments

00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:21.020
for localism may not be as strong
as we think they are when we think

00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:24.830
about sustainability and the planet
there's a good counter argument you

00:34:24.830 --> 00:34:30.170
can make that if it's much easier
to raise lambs say in New Zealand

00:34:30.170 --> 00:34:34.990
that ultimately you're saving
more carbon energy, you're greener

00:34:34.990 --> 00:34:38.730
if you raise your lamb in New
Zealand and ship it to New York

00:34:38.730 --> 00:34:40.030
than if you try to raise it

00:34:40.030 --> 00:34:45.010
in the more hospitable
ground of Upstate New York.

00:34:45.010 --> 00:34:49.010
And I ended by saying the best
argument for eating the local,

00:34:49.010 --> 00:34:51.880
the local tomatoes instead
of the African green beans is

00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:54.650
that they really do taste better.

00:34:54.650 --> 00:34:58.440
We hear a lot these days about
the fact value distinction.

00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:01.660
The famous philosophical idea
that distinguishes what is

00:35:01.660 --> 00:35:03.680
from what ought to be and insist

00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:07.800
that no fact no matter how
strong can determine our values,

00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:09.620
but we should perhaps
pay as much attention

00:35:09.620 --> 00:35:12.990
to what we might call the
act value distinction.

00:35:12.990 --> 00:35:16.350 position:56%
The distinction that makes us see
that it is not necessary for a thing

00:35:16.350 --> 00:35:21.020
to make something else good happen
in order to be good in itself.

00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:24.940
What if after all our beliefs
about sustainability in the planet

00:35:24.940 --> 00:35:30.680
and food turned out to be false or
redundant or a very minor value?

00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:32.970
Would we then give up
going to farmers markets

00:35:32.970 --> 00:35:37.070
and stewing organic lamb and
all go out together to Wendy's?

00:35:37.070 --> 00:35:40.030
I think it would still
be worth cooking slowly

00:35:40.030 --> 00:35:44.790
and shopping locally using Fergus
Henderson's whole beast not

00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:48.330
because these are acts that will
demonstrably do something good

00:35:48.330 --> 00:35:51.870
but because we believe these
things are good in themselves.

00:35:51.870 --> 00:35:53.610
We like them now.

00:35:53.610 --> 00:35:59.530
They don't ward off our later ills
they provide our present pleasures.

00:35:59.530 --> 00:36:01.700
It's good for you because
it tastes good though far

00:36:01.700 --> 00:36:04.280
from perfect advice is
generally stronger wisdom

00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:08.250
than its opposite it ought to taste
good because it's good for you.

00:36:08.250 --> 00:36:11.070
Stronger because it
appeals to an increasing joy

00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:14.690 position:56%
because it addresses the fact of
appetite, stronger because it speaks

00:36:14.690 --> 00:36:17.040
to first principles of pleasure.

00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:21.210
The fragility of life means that
our goal can never be to extend it

00:36:21.210 --> 00:36:23.340
but to enjoy it for
the simple reason

00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:24.770
that we can't really extend it

00:36:24.770 --> 00:36:27.850
and we know right now
if we're enjoying it.

00:36:27.850 --> 00:36:30.890
The fiercest arguments about ways
of eating tend to be the hardest

00:36:30.890 --> 00:36:35.430
to settle while the most frivolous
ones are the most definitive.

00:36:35.430 --> 00:36:38.270
You should drink wine, eat
chocolate, have dessert,

00:36:38.270 --> 00:36:41.280
fill your plate because
they fit your hunger

00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:44.970
and you should eat locally because
it connects you to your landscape,

00:36:44.970 --> 00:36:47.240
city breed or countrified.

00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:51.300
We can at least be definitive about
that for the life lived with a face

00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:55.310
on our food is a richer one
than a life lived without it.

00:36:55.310 --> 00:36:58.940
We can have our cake and eat it
too if you are willing to see

00:36:58.940 --> 00:37:03.640
that the only point of
having cake is to eat it.

00:37:04.990 --> 00:37:08.220
We can never know for sure what is
cause and what is just correlation,

00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:10.960
what's merely the happenstance
of simultaneous acts

00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:13.810
and what is the true order
of virtuous succession.

00:37:13.810 --> 00:37:16.320
Perhaps red wine makes
our hearts healthier.

00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:18.240
Perhaps it is only
that wealthier people

00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:22.890
with already healthy hearts are the
kinds who choose to drink red wine.

00:37:22.890 --> 00:37:26.420
We don't or rarely know for
certain what makes things happen.

00:37:26.420 --> 00:37:31.540 position:56%
We do know what things are like when
we eat or touch or watch them now.

00:37:31.540 --> 00:37:33.990
The best argument against
violent video games isn't

00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:36.230
that it makes kids
violent later it's

00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:39.050
that it shows kids violence now.

00:37:39.050 --> 00:37:41.970
It isn't what it does,
it's what it is.

00:37:41.970 --> 00:37:45.560
We will never know for
certain what food will do.

00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:49.000
We do know what dinner
is and that's enough.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.800
Thank you so much and
I would love to --

00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:58.880
[ Applause ]

00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:02.620
-- take some questions if I may?

00:38:02.620 --> 00:38:09.990
&gt;&gt; Yes, thank you for a
very dynamic presentation.

00:38:09.990 --> 00:38:14.480
And I [inaudible] listening
to all your books

00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:20.910
and I know you've done some audio
book work for your other writing.

00:38:20.910 --> 00:38:24.770 position:56%
I was just wondering if you could
talk about that and whether you plan

00:38:24.770 --> 00:38:28.570
to do the same with
your food writing?

00:38:28.570 --> 00:38:29.870
&gt;&gt; Adam Gopnik: Thank you.

00:38:29.870 --> 00:38:31.170
Audio books I love to do.

00:38:31.170 --> 00:38:32.900
I did an, I believe I did
the audio book of this one.

00:38:32.900 --> 00:38:34.200
I do audio books.

00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:38.140
I've done audio books of all
of my books because I'm a ham

00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:41.040
and I like to show off
and I like to do them.

00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:43.440
They're a very strange experience.

00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:46.610
I don't know this is why we
come to literary festivals

00:38:46.610 --> 00:38:48.750
where authors can tell
you secrets like these.

00:38:48.750 --> 00:38:52.890
They lock you in a little isolation
booth and you're not allowed

00:38:52.890 --> 00:38:55.270
to eat anything while
you're recording the book

00:38:55.270 --> 00:38:58.990
because any sound, lip sounds
and the gastric rumblings

00:38:58.990 --> 00:39:02.160
from your stomach will appear
on the final take because you're

00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:04.470
in a very tight little space.

00:39:04.470 --> 00:39:08.030
So, it takes 4 or 5 days
to record a book and all

00:39:08.030 --> 00:39:10.520
of that time you're not
eating anything all day long.

00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:14.480
It's a kind of monastic discipline
that you have to submit to.

00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:17.790
And I like to think that I've
gotten better at reading my books

00:39:17.790 --> 00:39:22.010
in the 15 years or so that I've
been doing my own audio books.

00:39:22.010 --> 00:39:24.640
I always assume, it take it as a
compliment that they always ask me

00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:26.770
to do it, but now that I
think about it as I look

00:39:26.770 --> 00:39:29.760 position:56%
at you I think you know just be they
don't want to pay anybody to do them

00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:33.380
and they know I come cheap.

00:39:33.380 --> 00:39:37.430
But when I first started doing
them I would read too quickly

00:39:37.430 --> 00:39:38.730
as you probably hear.

00:39:38.730 --> 00:39:41.490
I speak quickly and I was
reading much too quickly.

00:39:41.490 --> 00:39:44.900
So the producer would say
please speak more slowly.

00:39:44.900 --> 00:39:48.610
And then I slowed down
my voice until I sounded

00:39:48.610 --> 00:39:50.710
like a joke Rabbi on television.

00:39:50.710 --> 00:39:53.020
[Laughter] And then
they said, no, speed up,

00:39:53.020 --> 00:39:54.400
speak a little more quickly.

00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:58.760 position:56%
So, if you listen to my audio books,
you'll hear me it's like somebody

00:39:58.760 --> 00:40:01.610
who is, you know, on
an amphetamine bender

00:40:01.610 --> 00:40:03.150
because at first I'm talking
very, very, very quickly

00:40:03.150 --> 00:40:05.050
and then the producer says
no, no, slow down a bit

00:40:05.050 --> 00:40:08.560
and then I read very, very
slowly for another chapter

00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:10.700
and then I forget and the
next chapter goes very,

00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:13.210
very quickly again and then
the producer intervenes.

00:40:13.210 --> 00:40:17.170
So all of my audio books
have two distinct speeds,

00:40:17.170 --> 00:40:20.400
which you will notice if you listen
to them, but I love doing them

00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:26.090
and it delights me when people
seem to enjoy listening to them.

00:40:26.090 --> 00:40:28.410
One of the things you know New York
City is a very weird place and one

00:40:28.410 --> 00:40:30.730
of the ways it's really
weird is that our,

00:40:30.730 --> 00:40:33.640
kind of our habits are very
different from the habits

00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:36.540
of the rest of the country and one
of the things we don't do a lot

00:40:36.540 --> 00:40:39.930
in New York is commute
in cars, right?

00:40:39.930 --> 00:40:45.150 position:56%
So I'm always surprised when I'm out
in what I think will soon be obliged

00:40:45.150 --> 00:40:47.920
by legal compulsion to
call the Real American.

00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:49.220
&gt;&gt; Oh, oh, oh.

00:40:49.220 --> 00:40:50.520
&gt;&gt; Adam Gopnik: Exactly.

00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:54.350
When I'm out elsewhere I'm always
astounded by the number of people

00:40:54.350 --> 00:40:55.800
who say, no, no, I've
read your books.

00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:58.150
Well, I haven't really read
them but I've listened to them

00:40:58.150 --> 00:40:59.450
when I'm driving to work.

00:40:59.450 --> 00:41:01.020
So, that's a cool part of it.

00:41:01.020 --> 00:41:04.070
Sometimes a couple of
people have told me

00:41:04.070 --> 00:41:06.080
that they jog while
listening to my books,

00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:10.090
but I think that would be a
recipe for disaster if they do it.

00:41:10.090 --> 00:41:12.450
But thank you for that question.

00:41:12.450 --> 00:41:13.750
Gentleman here?

00:41:13.750 --> 00:41:16.680
&gt;&gt; Yeah. My wife and I have
been committed vegetarians

00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:18.290
for about 40 years.

00:41:18.290 --> 00:41:19.590
&gt;&gt; Adam Gopnik: Forty-years?

00:41:19.590 --> 00:41:20.890
&gt;&gt; Forty years, at
least 40 years, yeah.

00:41:20.890 --> 00:41:22.190
&gt;&gt; Adam Gopnik: Wow.

00:41:22.190 --> 00:41:23.490
You look so young.

00:41:23.490 --> 00:41:24.790
You're like an advertisement --

00:41:24.790 --> 00:41:26.090
&gt;&gt; -- since about 15 or so.

00:41:26.090 --> 00:41:31.000
Our first date we, first
dinner date, we actually went

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:34.880
to a vegetarian Indian
restaurant in the East Village.

00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:38.730 position:56%
We started talking about it I said I
was a vegetarian because I believed

00:41:38.730 --> 00:41:42.910
in sustainability and, you
know, beef destroys the earth.

00:41:42.910 --> 00:41:45.110
And she said, well,
you know I like animals

00:41:45.110 --> 00:41:47.020 position:56%
and you should treat animals kindly.

00:41:47.020 --> 00:41:51.340
By the end of the night we
started yelling at each other.

00:41:51.340 --> 00:41:53.240
The union of this odd
couple has been

00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:55.480
that we've got now
a vegan 16 year old.

00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:56.890
&gt;&gt; Adam Gopnik: Oh, now, really.

00:41:56.890 --> 00:41:58.990
&gt;&gt; She said my damn
parents, they don't give,

00:41:58.990 --> 00:42:00.430
they don't care at all about the --

00:42:00.430 --> 00:42:01.730
&gt;&gt; Adam Gopnik: -- that's right.

00:42:01.730 --> 00:42:03.610
&gt;&gt; But the, I mean the
root of all of this is

00:42:03.610 --> 00:42:07.090
that food has been central to
our family for years and years

00:42:07.090 --> 00:42:11.030
and the fast food culture that
we have developed, you know,

00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:16.290
particularly in the US I think
is destroying culture, history,

00:42:16.290 --> 00:42:20.020
community, family, and I know you
write a little bit about this,

00:42:20.020 --> 00:42:22.550
you know, sometimes tongue
in cheek, but can you talk

00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:26.340
about what your food culture
means and how we can move away

00:42:26.340 --> 00:42:31.480
from the fast food put it on the,
not even put it on the table,

00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:34.970
eat it in the car and what that
means for how we're organized

00:42:34.970 --> 00:42:38.130
as a society, how we
relate to each other,

00:42:38.130 --> 00:42:41.120
the existence of families
of these [inaudible].

00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:42.420
&gt;&gt; Adam Gopnik: Sure.

00:42:42.420 --> 00:42:43.720
I'll be delighted to.

00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:47.100
First of all I should say that my
family, the four of us, we go in

00:42:47.100 --> 00:42:51.190
and out of spasmodic vegetarianism,
you know, everybody kind of looks

00:42:51.190 --> 00:42:55.240
and said, you know, we really
shouldn't for the reasons your wife

00:42:55.240 --> 00:42:59.580
for ethical reasons we should
become ethical vegetarians and one

00:42:59.580 --> 00:43:02.450
of other the kids bangs
their, his or her first,

00:43:02.450 --> 00:43:05.450
and says I'm an ethical
vegetarian now.

00:43:05.450 --> 00:43:08.920
And then it fades after about
two weeks and they go back

00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:10.690
and I realize it's sort
of the equivalent for sort

00:43:10.690 --> 00:43:15.170
of Manhattan metropolitan
people of finding Jesus

00:43:15.170 --> 00:43:16.580
and then losing Jesus
again, you know?

00:43:16.580 --> 00:43:19.420
You find him and then you
lose him and then you go back

00:43:19.420 --> 00:43:22.180
and you find him again,
and we treat vegetarianism

00:43:22.180 --> 00:43:25.060
in that same hyper
spiritualized way.

00:43:25.060 --> 00:43:30.580
The whole question I have
complicated feelings.

00:43:30.580 --> 00:43:33.740
One of my favorite French saying is
that grown up people should be able

00:43:33.740 --> 00:43:38.660
to count to two meaning that you
rarely resolve a moral question

00:43:38.660 --> 00:43:41.460
with one category or
one commandment.

00:43:41.460 --> 00:43:44.160
It usually takes some development.

00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:46.930
I [inaudible] evangelical in this
book and in all of my writing

00:43:46.930 --> 00:43:49.600
and in my own personal
practice about the importance

00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:55.230
of the local market, the
green market, farmers,

00:43:55.230 --> 00:44:00.430
dinner served at a
table cooked by a parent

00:44:00.430 --> 00:44:03.380
or by a kid I deeply
believe in those things.

00:44:03.380 --> 00:44:06.410
I believe that that really
is the sustainability

00:44:06.410 --> 00:44:11.340
of civilization depends
on dinner, it much begins

00:44:11.340 --> 00:44:13.690
at dinner as Lord Byron said.

00:44:13.690 --> 00:44:15.820
Much depends on dinner
I beg your pardon,

00:44:15.820 --> 00:44:18.950 position:56%
and I believe those things are vital
and central and it's hard for me

00:44:18.950 --> 00:44:23.610
to conceptualize a rich,
not only rich family life

00:44:23.610 --> 00:44:29.060
but a rich civilization that
doesn't have the consistent

00:44:29.060 --> 00:44:32.710
and traditional rituals
of food at its core.

00:44:32.710 --> 00:44:34.980
At the same time that
counting to two, right,

00:44:34.980 --> 00:44:37.540
at the same time I
would be a terrible snob

00:44:37.540 --> 00:44:42.090 position:56%
and horribly unrealistic if I didn't
recognize that the fast food culture

00:44:42.090 --> 00:44:44.880
that you have described
has grown up not simply

00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:48.730
as a shoddy moral preference
but in response

00:44:48.730 --> 00:44:51.860
to the huge unimaginable pressures

00:44:51.860 --> 00:44:55.750
of daily life in a
capitalist society.

00:44:55.750 --> 00:44:59.360
So I would never want to be
morally punitive about people

00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:02.220
who have a different set
of rituals than I do.

00:45:02.220 --> 00:45:05.680 position:56%
And I think that's one of the tricks
in a pluralist country is you have

00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:09.130
to be evangelical about your
values without being moralistic

00:45:09.130 --> 00:45:11.020 position:56%
about their absence in other people.

00:45:11.020 --> 00:45:14.510
That's a complicated two step,
but I think it's an important one.

00:45:14.510 --> 00:45:18.040
[ Applause ]

00:45:18.040 --> 00:45:20.380
Broadly applicable I would say.

00:45:20.380 --> 00:45:25.080
So, I try and keep both
things I mind as I do.

00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:30.180
I think that it's remarkable when
you look around to see the degree

00:45:30.180 --> 00:45:33.170
to which, you know, that's the
salad and McDonald's, right?

00:45:33.170 --> 00:45:37.420
To see the degree to which the
values of that were regarded

00:45:37.420 --> 00:45:41.550
as extremely [inaudible]
elitists used that horrible word.

00:45:41.550 --> 00:45:43.910
Thirty years ago I think
of my friend, Alice Waters,

00:45:43.910 --> 00:45:47.500
about whom I have a chapter
the originator of Chez Panisse

00:45:47.500 --> 00:45:50.480
in Berkeley and one of the first
people to bring these values

00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:53.800 position:56%
in a very aggressive way to America.

00:45:53.800 --> 00:45:57.170
And she, actually when I
was with her in France once

00:45:57.170 --> 00:46:00.100
and I said has your daughter
ever been to McDonald's?

00:46:00.100 --> 00:46:01.540 position:56%
And what would you say if she asked?

00:46:01.540 --> 00:46:05.090
She said, oh, I would simply say I
would prefer not to become involved

00:46:05.090 --> 00:46:06.490
in that kind of activity.

00:46:06.490 --> 00:46:08.420
[Laughter] Which I
thought was like going

00:46:08.420 --> 00:46:11.360
to a brothel, you know,
or something.

00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:16.670
Values that were elitist when Alice
first spouts them 50 years ago,

00:46:16.670 --> 00:46:19.920
40 years ago, are now commonplace
and you see them everywhere.

00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:23.620 position:56%
You see them even in, you know, Pret
A Monjay [phonetic], or some places

00:46:23.620 --> 00:46:26.160
like that, fast food places
that have those values.

00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:29.150
So I think that we should
never apologize for believing

00:46:29.150 --> 00:46:34.800
in those things, but we should
never enforce them in any way

00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:37.620
and we should always have a
little bit of modesty in our minds

00:46:37.620 --> 00:46:41.320
because we know that whatever
the good food rules are

00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:45.510
of our time will look ridiculous
50 years hence and we know

00:46:45.510 --> 00:46:47.330
that because the good rules

00:46:47.330 --> 00:46:50.900
of 50 years past look
ridiculous to us in lots of ways.

00:46:50.900 --> 00:46:54.650
What counted as good food
then now looks more dubious.

00:46:54.650 --> 00:46:56.300
So I try to keep both
things in mind.

00:46:56.300 --> 00:47:00.490 position:56%
In fact at one point in this book, I
explain and you don't get many books

00:47:00.490 --> 00:47:05.500
like this, that I give you the
secret of life, the secret of life,

00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:08.670
and it's right in the middle
of the third chapter actually.

00:47:08.670 --> 00:47:10.830
I shouldn't tell you, you'd have
to buy it and you'll get the secret

00:47:10.830 --> 00:47:15.380
of life, but basically it makes
sense same point in a different way

00:47:15.380 --> 00:47:19.670
that the secret of life is having
enough passion about your values

00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:23.320
to live them fully and enough
irony about your values

00:47:23.320 --> 00:47:25.200
to view them skeptically.

00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:27.930
I'll take one last question
and then I have to go.

00:47:27.930 --> 00:47:31.300
&gt;&gt; Do you ever go to
dinner with Calvin Trillin

00:47:31.300 --> 00:47:34.650
and exchange food philosophies?

00:47:34.650 --> 00:47:36.970
&gt;&gt; Adam Gopnik: I wouldn't want
to go to dinner with Trillin

00:47:36.970 --> 00:47:39.720
because he would take
all the food, you know.

00:47:39.720 --> 00:47:44.090
He's more of a fresser [phonetic]
than a philosopher, Trillin,

00:47:44.090 --> 00:47:48.370
but it's nice that you ask that as
we finish up because I have been

00:47:48.370 --> 00:47:50.730
to dinner with Trillin
from time to time.

00:47:50.730 --> 00:47:53.480
We always seem to end up at
occasions like this and people say,

00:47:53.480 --> 00:47:57.670
oh, they both are big eaters and
Jewish so we'll put them together

00:47:57.670 --> 00:48:03.360
at a thing, but Trillin's
food writing, Alice Let's Eat,

00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:07.980
American Fry, those wonderful
books, totally opened

00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:09.530
up for me the possibility
that writing

00:48:09.530 --> 00:48:12.920
about food can not only be funny
as I hope mine is sometimes,

00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:16.550
but could also be a window
onto domestic delights.

00:48:16.550 --> 00:48:22.350
There could be a way of finding
the whole little play of what we do

00:48:22.350 --> 00:48:26.100
and as a consequence the first
thing you will read in this book,

00:48:26.100 --> 00:48:28.920
The Table Comes First, is the
dedication page for Martha,

00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:33.320
Luke and Olivia, my family, who
sit in chair at the nightly table

00:48:33.320 --> 00:48:34.870
and for Calvin Trillin,
who set the standard.

00:48:34.870 --> 00:48:36.170
So, thanks so much.

00:48:36.170 --> 00:48:37.970
Thank you so much for coming.
