00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.176
So let's say we have a width of a hundred inches and each of these tiles is five

00:00:04.176 --> 00:00:10.470
by five inches. Note that except for the first tile, the others come in pairs.

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:15.329
Each pair is ten inches long. So if I take my width, subtract the 5 inches here

00:00:15.329 --> 00:00:23.258
then I have 95 inches left and how many 10 inch pairs can I put in there? But

00:00:23.258 --> 00:00:29.732
if divide 95 by 10, that's 9.5. I discard the remainder, so I know I have nine

00:00:29.732 --> 00:00:37.848
pairs, and the white one for a total of 19 tiles, 10 white, and 9 red. Great,

00:00:37.848 --> 00:00:42.604
that's my answer in this particular instance. Now the next step is to figure it

00:00:42.604 --> 00:00:46.980
out for arbitrary values after which and the tile sides
