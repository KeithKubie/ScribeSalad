00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.730
All right. Let's try creating a maintenance ticket and see if this works.

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:03.160
&gt;&gt; Sounds good.

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:06.850
&gt;&gt; So the technician I'm guessing will be me.

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:10.130
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So in this case it has to be you, but I mean, usually

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:13.290
there'll be a bunch of people in an organization, so you could add any user.

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.550
&gt;&gt; Okay. the stage will be the Udacity Stage, let's say. Status, New.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.940
Priority high and let's say that the

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.430
description is that everything is completely broken.

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.120
&gt;&gt; Got your work cut

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.740
out for you, Andy.

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.050
&gt;&gt; I know. This is bad news. So save.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.160
&gt;&gt; So you should be able to see the tasks

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.800
that we've just created from this page. But we'd have to

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.220
add that related list of the activities and activity history onto

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.030
the page layout in order to be able to see that.

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.520
&gt;&gt; Okay, so I'll edit the layout.
