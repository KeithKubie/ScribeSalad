00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:02.063
- Good morning.

00:00:02.063 --> 00:00:03.320
I hope you're having an amazing day.

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:04.153
It's Mark Wiens.

00:00:04.153 --> 00:00:06.300
I'm in Koh Kood, which is one of the most

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.670
well-preserved, gorgeous, and pristine

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:11.500
islands in Thailand.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.110
You'll find amazing
jungle here and beaches,

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:16.480
delicious seafood.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.650
And today is gonna be
an unforgettable day.

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:20.520
We're gonna go around the island.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.050
We're gonna stop at some of the most

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.130
beautiful places on the island.

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.810
And this is gonna be a tour
of Koh Kood and I am gonna

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.493
share it all with you in
this video, right now.

00:00:29.493 --> 00:00:32.826
(upbeat tropical music)

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.800
This is day eight and this
is the final day of our

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.220
Eastern provinces of Thailand
food and travel tour.

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.560
It's been an amazing trip and I'll have

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.410
the links and the entire playlist below,

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.010
so you can watch all the videos.

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.270
In order to get to Koh Kood,

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.190
yesterday actually we came from Koh Chang.

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.280
But we drove our car to
Koh Chang, so we had to

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.620
take the ferry back to the mainland.

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.050
Then we drove to a place called
Lan Sak, which is the pier

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.400
at the end of the
peninsula to catch a ferry.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.233
We took a ferry.

00:01:04.233 --> 00:01:08.130
It's called Boonsiri, which
is a speed ferry service.

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.420
But a pretty big boat,
so it's not rough water.

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.870
And that's about an
hour and fifteen minutes

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:15.740
to get to Koh Kood island.

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.750
And then, from there you
jump into the back of a

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.120
rute songthaew, which is
a truck transportation

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.160
and they drop you off at your
hotel that you're staying at.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.490
Right now, we're gonna quickly
have breakfast at the hotel

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.670
and then a driver will come to meet us

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.422
and we're gonna start
cruisin' around the island.

00:01:31.422 --> 00:01:32.810
This is gonna be an unforgettable day.

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.136
This is a gorgeous island.

00:01:35.136 --> 00:01:38.340
(upbeat tropical music)

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.173
Mmmm.

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.675
They have seriously
good pineapple in Trat.

00:01:43.675 --> 00:01:47.008
(upbeat tropical music)

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.170
Part of the reason why Koh Kood is

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.360
so nice, and so calm, and so peaceful

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.818
is because you can't, whoa.

00:01:55.818 --> 00:01:56.651
(laughing)

00:01:56.651 --> 00:01:58.510
You can't drive your
own car to the island.

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:59.867
They don't have a ferry
to bring your car in.

00:01:59.867 --> 00:02:01.340
And they have rute songthaews,

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.130
which are back of the truck pickups

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:05.500
that you can rent for the day.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.730
So, we rented one for the day.

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:07.830
We're gonna go around.

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.300
Looking a little rainy, but
you know this is an island

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.063
so things can change
drastically very quickly.

00:02:13.063 --> 00:02:16.396
(upbeat tropical music)

00:02:22.777 --> 00:02:26.944
(speaking Thai and pots clanging)

00:02:35.793 --> 00:02:37.920
(laughing and speaking Thai)

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.960
I've read some figures that
say Koh Kood has a local

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.300
population of somewhere
between 1,000 and 2,000 people.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.020
And so, there's not a huge

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:50.330
need for demand for local restaurants.

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.630
So, we asked our driver to
just bring us to a place

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.840
that he eats for breakfast, a local place.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.690
This is about as local as
you could get in Koh Kood.

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:59.940
They have a number of different curries.

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.980
It's mostly kao king, but
they also have betheow,

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.080
they also have noodles here.

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.390
They have a couple of interesting dishes,

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.140
including a mushroom curry
that we're gonna try.

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.770
But, this is a cool little spot.

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:10.080
I'll begin with the (speaking in Thai),

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.480
which is a free-range chicken.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.820
There's some blood jelly in here as well.

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.980
The chicken, some pea eggplants,

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.992
some I think that could be,
oh yeah these are definitely

00:03:19.992 --> 00:03:22.450
one of the most common
ingredients in Trat,

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.820
especially with curries,
is mngkud sabpard.

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.650
Which is the pineapple crown.

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.003
I think that's what they're
using in there, too.

00:03:32.267 --> 00:03:33.184
Mmmm, mmmm.

00:03:34.333 --> 00:03:35.493
That is awesome.

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:38.150
You know what's unique about that?

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.870
I can taste more of a
dry spice blend in there.

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.140
It tastes like cumin, which
is coming in really nicely.

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.540
Along with those herbs, along
with the kaffir lime leaves,

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.793
along with the Mngkud sabpard,
which is the pineapple crown.

00:03:52.531 --> 00:03:53.820
It's a little bit spicy.

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.261
It's really, really nicely flavored.

00:03:56.261 --> 00:03:59.594
(upbeat tropical music)

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:02.400
That's an excellent curry.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.490
By far, the most interesting dish to me

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:07.240
that they had up front there
is called (speaking Thai).

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.280
This is a type of mushroom curry that

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.410
I haven't heard of before.

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:13.930
I think it's some type of a wild

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:15.320
mushroom from the forest here.

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.670
And look how thick that coconut milk is.

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:19.862
That's like melted butter.

00:04:19.862 --> 00:04:22.027
(upbeat tropical music)

00:04:22.027 --> 00:04:22.860
Whoa.

00:04:24.488 --> 00:04:25.321
Mmmm.

00:04:27.424 --> 00:04:30.130
Oh, oh that's an insane mushroom.

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:31.620
Okay, first let me start
with the coconut cream.

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.520
That's outrageously thick,
and creamy, and rich.

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.050
It has a natural coconut sweetness to it

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:39.560
with a little chili in there

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:40.650
and then you get to that mushroom.

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:45.650
That mushroom has this like,
unbelievably slimy yet soft,

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.480
very soft dissolve in your mouth texture.

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.410
And that follows with a bitterness,

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:53.850
a really nice bitterness that sort of

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:55.220
overwhelms your mouth.

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:56.843
I love bitterness.

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:04.400
That is sensational, mmmm.

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.590
You know what the texture
of those mushrooms is like?

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:09.420
It's almost like the texture of an oyster.

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:10.289
Did you taste it?

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:11.406
- Yeah.

00:05:11.406 --> 00:05:12.384
You like it?

00:05:12.384 --> 00:05:14.339
- It's good, but cold.

00:05:14.339 --> 00:05:15.172
- Cold. bitter, huh?

00:05:15.172 --> 00:05:17.460
I was just asking them where
those mushrooms come from

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.940
and conveniently located right there,

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:23.915
they said they come from they
grow somehow on this tree.

00:05:23.915 --> 00:05:26.582
(speaking Thai)

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:33.130
After the leaves drop
to the ground naturally,

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:34.240
especially with rain, right?

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.480
During like rain, they'll
drop to the ground and then

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:39.440
the mushrooms will grow out
of the ground from that leaf.

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:40.380
Something like that.

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:41.900
Very cool mushroom.

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:45.410
Very amazing, bitter taste to
go with that coconut cream.

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:46.283
I love it.

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.073
They don't exactly have a restaurant name.

00:05:49.073 --> 00:05:51.690
I think they just use the owner's name,

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:53.430
but it's called Saleun.

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:54.420
This is the front here.

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:57.920
You'll see some green
tarps hanging out front.

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:00.360
What a great little restaurant and

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.520
yeah, we got lucky with
that mushroom curry.

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:05.400
That is the type of dish
that I gets me pumped,

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:06.530
that gets me excited.

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:07.380
That was so good.

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:09.713
A new flavor; a new mushroom to me.

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:13.400
Just right off the tree, right there.

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:14.440
Oh man, that was delicious.

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:15.540
Okay, we're movin' on.

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:17.830
And by the way, huge thank you

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:19.725
to our driver for bringing us here.

00:06:19.725 --> 00:06:23.058
(upbeat tropical music)

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:26.890
This is the type of jungle
that you can imagine

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:30.190
yourself swinging from
tree to tree on a vine.

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:32.210
Well, I like to imagine that.

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:33.240
That would be a lot of fun.

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:36.537
We're on our way to some
really old, big trees.

00:06:36.537 --> 00:06:39.870
(upbeat tropical music)

00:06:46.377 --> 00:06:48.800
The first tree is called Makayuk.

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.913
It's huge; it means a huge Makka tree.

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:59.300
Okay, yeah this is
definitely a gigantic tree

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:01.720
that just looks like
it reaches to the sky.

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:05.260
And the base of the tree is
also quite gigantic, wow.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:09.338
And then, it kinda like
V's off midway up the tree.

00:07:09.338 --> 00:07:12.671
(upbeat tropical music)

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:16.910
Then, just a short distance
away is another tree

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:19.465
called bonsai, which is a Banyan tree.

00:07:19.465 --> 00:07:22.798
(upbeat tropical music)

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:27.880
It's so eerie and so,

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:29.163
so mystical.

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:33.520
Both of the trees, extremely gorgeous.

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.514
And what a pristine jungle.

00:07:35.514 --> 00:07:38.097
(upbeat music)

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:49.500
Next up we're on our way
to Klong Chao waterfall,

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:52.140
which is one of the most
well-known waterfalls.

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:54.807
(rushing water)

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:02.010
It does require a little
bit of rock-hopping

00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:04.045
to get to the main waterfall.

00:08:04.045 --> 00:08:06.628
(upbeat music)

00:08:08.169 --> 00:08:11.360
Oh yeah, that water is
perfectly refreshing.

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:12.960
It's so quiet, it's so peaceful,

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:14.760
it's beautiful, it's lush.

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:16.169
Ah, this is fantastic.

00:08:16.169 --> 00:08:18.836
(rushing water)

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:22.423
It's raining now, but that was

00:08:22.423 --> 00:08:24.790
that waterfall is
definitely worth a visit,

00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:26.700
definitely worth a swim.

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:27.740
I'm refreshed.

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:28.840
That was a lot of fun.

00:08:30.761 --> 00:08:31.780
(laughing)

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:33.010
That was great.

00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:34.060
Okay, we're on our way.

00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:36.697
Oh man, the camera is
like soaking right now.

00:08:36.697 --> 00:08:40.030
(upbeat tropical music)

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:44.230
We're driving next to a
place called Khao Reua Rub.

00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:46.756
I'm not exactly sure what
it is, we'll find out.

00:08:46.756 --> 00:08:50.089
(upbeat tropical music)

00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:01.530
So at the top it's actually
a shrine and it's a

00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:04.734
like a naval shrine, I believe.

00:09:04.734 --> 00:09:08.067
(upbeat tropical music)

00:09:17.064 --> 00:09:19.040
(sighs)

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:20.490
Next, we're driving to another beach.

00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:21.922
It's called Bang Bao.

00:09:21.922 --> 00:09:24.505
(upbeat music)

00:09:29.714 --> 00:09:32.297
(upbeat music)

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:40.990
Oh man, this is one of the beaches

00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:42.810
I wanted to visit in Koh Kood.

00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:46.400
This is, it's a paradise beach, wow.

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:48.890
There's some docks going
out to fishing boats.

00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:52.870
The water is crystal
clear, the palm trees.

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:55.500
This is an impressively beautiful beach.

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:57.890
I'm just gonna take a walk
out to the end of this dock

00:09:57.890 --> 00:09:59.660
to see the boats,

00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:01.300
to see the clear water out there

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:03.370
and then we have to take a swim here.

00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:04.890
There's no way you can not.

00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:07.473
(upbeat music)

00:10:12.581 --> 00:10:15.164
(upbeat music)

00:10:18.375 --> 00:10:21.960
(water splashing)

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:24.080
And from here, we're gonna
go to the fishing village.

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:26.420
We're gonna hopefully
find some amazing seafood.

00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:28.620
And that's also gonna,
eh it looks incredible.

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:30.850
That's one of the things
I wanted to do most here.

00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:32.320
But, this is the type of beach.

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:34.790
I mean, you could just sit in this water

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:38.020
all day long and not go anywhere.

00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:42.033
Oh this is just, this is
fabulous; this is so good.

00:10:44.507 --> 00:10:45.340
(laughing)

00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:47.860
He doesn't wanna go; he just
wants to stay here all day.

00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:50.693
(water splashing)

00:10:53.770 --> 00:10:55.970
Part of what makes that
beach so spectacular

00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:58.523
is that it's so quiet, so peaceful.

00:11:00.209 --> 00:11:03.542
(upbeat tropical music)

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:11.980
We just got dropped off at Ao Yai,

00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:14.300
which is a traditional fishing village.

00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:17.910
It's on the West Coast of Koh Kood

00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:19.210
and also on the South side.

00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:20.400
We're gonna walk around for a little bit

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:22.955
and then we're gonna eat some seafood.

00:11:22.955 --> 00:11:26.288
(upbeat tropical music)

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:35.880
It's actually quite a
decently large village.

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:38.370
All on stilts, a fishing village.

00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:40.800
You just keep walking back and

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:44.150
there are houses, there
are little restaurants.

00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:48.200
But, most of this
community is all fishing.

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:50.103
Wow, look at that school of fish.

00:11:53.629 --> 00:11:55.179
(engine running)

00:11:55.179 --> 00:11:58.096
(speaking in Thai)

00:12:02.137 --> 00:12:05.054
(speaking in Thai)

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:09.410
They have a number of
different seafood restaurants.

00:12:09.410 --> 00:12:11.910
We've chosen one that's called Chonthicha.

00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:13.580
You can choose your own seafood.

00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:16.150
They have some tanks going
with different shellfish

00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:18.220
and a variety of things.

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:21.520
And they have these giant
nets just filled with fish.

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:23.940
I ordered a couple of unique things

00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:25.390
that I've never tried before.

00:12:27.029 --> 00:12:28.678
(water splashing)

00:12:28.678 --> 00:12:32.535
(upbeat tropical music)

00:12:32.535 --> 00:12:34.710
(fish flapping)

00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:37.024
We also ordered some kind of,

00:12:37.024 --> 00:12:39.070
it's some type of a Slipper lobster.

00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:42.200
It's just straight sea-to-table dining.

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:44.640
They have herbs growing here.

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:48.880
The ocean breeze is in
your face and I'm hungry.

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:51.730
A couple of the dishes have
just arrived and still waiting

00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:53.740
on a couple of the
dishes, but let's start.

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:55.350
This one is (speaking in Thai).

00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:58.200
It's squid fried with a garlic sauce.

00:12:58.200 --> 00:12:59.850
Look at that rich sauce.

00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:02.090
And look at how they've cut up the squid

00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:04.090
into like, it looks like a pineapple.

00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:06.080
My bench is a little
bit high for this table,

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:07.530
so I'm sittin' way up here.

00:13:07.530 --> 00:13:08.853
I gotta lean over.

00:13:12.271 --> 00:13:13.104
Mmmm.

00:13:14.479 --> 00:13:16.590
Oh, that's awesome.

00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:21.590
Mmmm, you got the garlic sauce
and black pepper in there.

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:24.750
It's a little bit sweet; nice and salty.

00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:28.210
And then like the texture
of the squid is like,

00:13:28.210 --> 00:13:30.170
it's like... bouncy

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:33.403
and almost like jelly-ish
and really tender.

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:38.607
Next dish is called (speaking in Thai).

00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:41.980
This is a type of curry, you can see.

00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:45.060
What you have to admire is just how thick

00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:47.210
and curdled that coconut milk is.

00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:49.610
Paired with, what I believe
is the (speaking in Thai),

00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:53.273
which is the shrimp automoly head oil.

00:13:53.273 --> 00:13:56.606
(upbeat tropical music)

00:13:58.305 --> 00:14:00.440
Mmmm, but you've got really
rich coconut milk in there.

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:03.310
You can taste that oil of the shrimp.

00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:04.950
It looks really orange
and red, but it doesn't

00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:06.633
actually it's not spicy.

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:09.787
In Thai, it's called (speaking in Thai).

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:12.320
Is rambutan, the fruit.

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:15.740
The hairy, spiky rambutan little fruit.

00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:17.130
And so you can see, the shell

00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:18.310
does sort of look like that, too.

00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:19.800
And I just looked it up in English.

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:22.510
It's some type of a rock shell mollusk.

00:14:22.510 --> 00:14:24.710
Oh, another name for it is a Murex,

00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:27.680
which is a genus of medium to large sized

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:30.180
predatory tropical sea snails.

00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:32.350
It's served as sashimi; it's served raw.

00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:34.600
But, they might just
quickly flash-blanch it.

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:36.870
They have sliced it quite thin.

00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:38.020
Before using any of the sauce,

00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:40.353
we gotta take a bite of just the straight.

00:14:43.103 --> 00:14:44.748
Mmmm.

00:14:44.748 --> 00:14:49.300
Oh, that has an amazing
like crispness to it.

00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:52.870
Whoa, and also quite a nice
natural sweetness as well.

00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:54.270
Actually guys, you keep
on chewing it almost has

00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:56.770
a nutty taste to it, too plus it's sweet.

00:14:56.770 --> 00:14:59.193
Okay, we got to dip in
the (speaking Thai) next.

00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:02.270
Oh, with that sauce.

00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:04.460
Oh, what an enhancement.

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:05.800
That sauce.

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:08.120
Again, I think (speaking
Thai) they used salt

00:15:08.970 --> 00:15:10.530
maybe instead of fish
sauce, but you can taste

00:15:10.530 --> 00:15:12.330
the pungent chillies and garlic in there.

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:16.000
It's just balanced by a
hint of sweetness and spicy.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.180
It's delicious.

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:18.883
Dip into the soy sauce.

00:15:21.795 --> 00:15:23.250
Mmmm, oh that's a dish.

00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:25.110
I must've got a different
piece of the shell

00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:26.540
from a different side or something

00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:29.450
'cause that's more tender
without that crunch.

00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:30.570
Totally different texture.

00:15:30.570 --> 00:15:32.637
Next up, for the type of Slipper lobster.

00:15:32.637 --> 00:15:34.417
`Which, in Thai are
called (speaking in Thai).

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:38.810
And these are deep fried
with garlic sauce as well.

00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:41.390
They kind of have a little
bit of an alien appearance

00:15:41.390 --> 00:15:43.150
with like an armored shell around them.

00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:45.030
And I think, what you can do.

00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:46.590
oh, they sorta like cut them in half.

00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:48.620
Oh, so you open it.

00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:51.193
But, that's like an extremely hard shell.

00:15:52.450 --> 00:15:55.200
And I think you take off the head.

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:58.500
You've got this tail, which
is like a mini lobster tail.

00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:00.760
Wow, that's quite an intense shell.

00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:03.230
Oh there we go, yes.

00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:05.185
Okay, I got it all out in one bite.

00:16:05.185 --> 00:16:08.518
(upbeat tropical music)

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:11.210
Insanely delicious, mmmm.

00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:14.130
It tastes like lobster.

00:16:14.130 --> 00:16:16.050
Has a little more of an
earthy tone to it, though.

00:16:16.050 --> 00:16:18.540
Last dish we got is called Hoy Pawk.

00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:21.940
Which is, they look like giant clams.

00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:23.680
But, I didn't know they
were gonna de-shell them

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:24.680
or that they shelled them first.

00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:27.930
These are, that's a
whole an entire spoonful.

00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:30.071
And then, I ended up with some

00:16:30.071 --> 00:16:32.152
kind of a curry paste and basil.

00:16:32.152 --> 00:16:35.485
(upbeat tropical music)

00:16:39.576 --> 00:16:40.409
Whoa.

00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:43.090
That's kinda on the chewy side.

00:16:43.090 --> 00:16:44.640
It does, it tastes like a clam.

00:16:46.263 --> 00:16:47.163
Like a giant clam.

00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:51.530
And then, that's in a kind
of a nutty chili sauce.

00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:54.210
As we're eating it started
raining, drizzling.

00:16:54.210 --> 00:16:56.959
But, still the atmosphere is spectacular.

00:16:56.959 --> 00:17:00.440
(upbeat tropical music)

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:03.230
This one is just a little
guy, but I know it would be

00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:06.133
incredible with that seafood sauce on it.

00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:09.812
Oh yeah, what a natural scoop.

00:17:09.812 --> 00:17:13.145
(upbeat tropical music)

00:17:16.538 --> 00:17:18.810
Those Slipper lobsters are incredible.

00:17:18.810 --> 00:17:22.580
It's really, really
flavorful, really sweet.

00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:25.436
I love the texture and with that sauce.

00:17:25.436 --> 00:17:28.769
(upbeat tropical music)

00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:32.737
That is incredibly delicious.

00:17:32.737 --> 00:17:37.170
And really, there are like at
least three different sections

00:17:37.170 --> 00:17:40.960
that have totally different
textures and sweetnesses.

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:43.420
That piece that I just had,
that might be from like

00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:44.430
the center or something 'cause

00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:46.910
it's the sweetest and the softest.

00:17:46.910 --> 00:17:48.100
It's really tender.

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:51.200
Finished with that seafood
meal, and I have to tell you

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:54.010
one of my, like indicators of

00:17:54.010 --> 00:17:56.670
kinda iffy food, is when they put

00:17:56.670 --> 00:17:59.190
an orchid next to your plate of food.

00:17:59.190 --> 00:18:01.680
I mean, that's of course
just a general statement

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:03.700
but, it's kinda true
that they kinda tone down

00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:06.060
the flavors when they
do that type of thing.

00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:08.130
But, they did that at this
restaurant and actually

00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:10.140
it was quite good; the food was excellent.

00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:13.330
The seafood is no doubt,
extraordinarily fresh.

00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:16.787
And I'm excited because they
had a few different things.

00:18:16.787 --> 00:18:18.330
Unique things that I've never had,

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:20.420
like that, that predatory

00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:21.520
rock shell

00:18:22.429 --> 00:18:23.939
Morex.

00:18:23.939 --> 00:18:27.272
(upbeat tropical music)

00:18:34.506 --> 00:18:37.839
(upbeat tropical music)

00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:46.990
We made it back to Kung Pao,

00:18:46.990 --> 00:18:49.650
back to the beach where we
started off this morning.

00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:51.410
What a fantastic day.

00:18:51.410 --> 00:18:53.520
Oh, let me sit up a little bit.

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:55.070
It turned out to be a perfect day.

00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:56.900
We got a little bit of
rain, but that's okay.

00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:58.400
We got a little bit of sunshine.

00:18:58.400 --> 00:18:59.480
We had some cloudy weather.

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:00.620
But...

00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:04.360
Koh Kood is truly a paradise island.

00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:07.860
I mean the combination
of beaches, waterfalls,

00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:10.520
thick lush jungle,

00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:11.920
seafood,

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:13.310
crystal clear beaches.

00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:15.410
I probably already said that once.

00:19:15.410 --> 00:19:18.810
But, it's really a gorgeous island.

00:19:18.810 --> 00:19:23.160
It's also nice because
it's quiet, it's laid-back.

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:27.800
And to be honest, there's
not a lot of food options.

00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:30.760
Most people actually
just come to this island,

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:32.830
they stay at their resort or their hotel,

00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:35.130
they eat the food at their hotel and

00:19:35.130 --> 00:19:36.650
maybe go out to do a little site-seeing.

00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:38.890
But, this is the type of
island that you can come

00:19:38.890 --> 00:19:41.300
to sit and do nothing.

00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:42.910
And that not only brings us to the end

00:19:42.910 --> 00:19:45.080
of this video about Koh Kood island,

00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:48.800
but this also brings us to
the end of this entire series.

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:51.900
And if you haven't watched
the entire series of this

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:56.050
Eastern region of Thailand
food and travel tour,

00:19:56.050 --> 00:19:57.920
there are a total of eight videos.

00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:00.160
I'll leave all the links in
the description box below,

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:03.670
but you can check out and
watch the entire playlist.

00:20:03.670 --> 00:20:07.420
It's been the entire
Eastern region of Thailand

00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:08.440
is a region that

00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:10.800
for me, I think the food is not

00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:12.210
is very under-represented.

00:20:12.210 --> 00:20:13.940
Even in Bangkok, you won't find

00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:17.150
that much Eastern type Thai food.

00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:20.130
And so, it's been a learning experience.

00:20:20.130 --> 00:20:22.690
Some incredibly delicious food.

00:20:22.690 --> 00:20:24.090
The seafood stands out.

00:20:24.090 --> 00:20:26.900
Some of the best seafood
I've had in Thailand.

00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:28.090
The people are great.

00:20:28.090 --> 00:20:29.300
We've been to villages.

00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:30.940
We started off in Chanthaburi,

00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:33.620
we came to Trat, we went to Koh Chang,

00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:35.760
and then finally ending in Koh Kood.

00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:38.810
And it's been an extremely memorable trip.

00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:41.100

and I will see you on the next video.
