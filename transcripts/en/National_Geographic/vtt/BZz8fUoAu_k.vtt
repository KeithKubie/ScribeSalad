00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.004
( intro music )

00:00:06.772 --> 00:00:09.542
( applause )

00:00:11.077 --> 00:00:13.780 line:0%
When we put together the
proposal for this talk,

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.282 line:0%
I suspected that many people
would be wondering about

00:00:16.282 --> 00:00:18.918 line:0%
this pair, pairing of
data and the wilderness,

00:00:18.918 --> 00:00:21.821
because I think the way we
think about those two words,

00:00:21.821 --> 00:00:24.089
they're quite far apart.

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:29.996
We don't think of those things
being paired together but...

00:00:29.996 --> 00:00:33.233
I hope that we'll find out
over the next few minutes that

00:00:33.233 --> 00:00:37.403
that they actually do go
very well together indeed.

00:00:37.403 --> 00:00:40.873
The word data, we hear
this word every day now.

00:00:40.873 --> 00:00:46.078
And it's something that's become
really ubiquitous in our lives.

00:00:46.078 --> 00:00:48.080
The definition of data
is fairly simple.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.783
Data are measurements
of something.

00:00:50.783 --> 00:00:55.021
But it... the word
itself has become

00:00:55.021 --> 00:00:57.290
something much
more than that.

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:58.758
And what I want to
talk about today is

00:00:58.758 --> 00:01:02.061
I want to talk about
the idea of data

00:01:02.061 --> 00:01:05.732
paired with this
concept of distance.

00:01:06.832 --> 00:01:09.602
<i> - I estimated here</i>
- ( audience laughter )

00:01:09.602 --> 00:01:12.338
<i> and I think
 I estimated generously,</i>

00:01:12.338 --> 00:01:16.275
but standing in front of
you in this crowd today

00:01:16.275 --> 00:01:19.679
the hippo in question
was somewhere about

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:22.415
the middle of the crowd.

00:01:22.415 --> 00:01:26.252
And, some hippo data,
in case you don't know

00:01:26.252 --> 00:01:29.021
a male hippo, they're the,
mostly the angry ones.

00:01:29.021 --> 00:01:31.757
They weigh about three
and a half tons.

00:01:31.757 --> 00:01:35.428
They're five feet tall
and 13 feet long.

00:01:35.428 --> 00:01:40.566
- This is an angry minivan.
- ( audience laughter )

00:01:40.566 --> 00:01:42.902
It may surprise you
from looking at me but

00:01:42.902 --> 00:01:46.672
I was not a rugged explorer
type when I was a child.

00:01:46.672 --> 00:01:47.974
( audience laughter )

00:01:47.974 --> 00:01:51.343
<i> And I spent
 most of that time</i>

00:01:51.343 --> 00:01:55.048
<i>exploring through the computer.</i>

00:01:55.348 --> 00:01:57.883
<i> And since then I've used
 the computer and tools</i>

00:01:57.883 --> 00:02:01.420
<i> that have been created
 to make art with the computer.</i>

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.257
<i> And, I started to use data.</i>

00:02:04.257 --> 00:02:07.360
<i> The simple examples are these
 stylized charts and graphs.</i>

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.728
<i> This is a graph showing</i>

00:02:08.728 --> 00:02:11.697
<i> the frequency of the words
 "communism" at the bottom</i>

00:02:11.697 --> 00:02:14.433
<i> and "terrorism" at the top
 in the New York Times</i>

00:02:14.433 --> 00:02:17.403
<i> between 1980 and 2010.</i>

00:02:17.403 --> 00:02:21.874
Now, all of this
hinges on the fact

00:02:21.874 --> 00:02:24.777
that data is a deeply
human artifact.

00:02:24.777 --> 00:02:28.981
There would be no data
without humans. We create it.

00:02:28.981 --> 00:02:32.518
Our normal understanding of this
is something quite different.

00:02:32.518 --> 00:02:35.121
And so when Steve approached
me to work on this project,

00:02:35.121 --> 00:02:36.489
one of the primarily exci--

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:39.192
things that I was very
much excited about here was

00:02:39.192 --> 00:02:42.428
how can we remind
people of the humans

00:02:42.428 --> 00:02:44.931
that are on this expedition
and how can we track them

00:02:44.931 --> 00:02:46.932
at the same time that we're
tracking the wildlife

00:02:46.932 --> 00:02:48.967
which is the primary
focus of the science.

00:02:48.967 --> 00:02:50.769
And while I was at
the<i> New York Times</i> ,

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:52.405
I was at the Times for
two and a half years

00:02:52.405 --> 00:02:54.707
as their data artist
in residence,

00:02:54.707 --> 00:02:57.643
I produced along with a
couple of collaborators

00:02:57.643 --> 00:02:59.111
a project called "Open Paths".

00:02:59.111 --> 00:03:01.280
<i> It allows you to do exactly
 what every other app</i>

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.150
<i> in your pocket does
 but with one big difference.</i>

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:05.384
<i> And that is that
 you can turn around</i>

00:03:05.384 --> 00:03:07.153
<i> and look at the data first.</i>

00:03:07.153 --> 00:03:10.189
<i> And second, nobody owns
 that data except for you.</i>

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:11.590
<i> So, we built this project.</i>

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.192
<i> I installed "Open Paths"
 on my phone</i>

00:03:13.192 --> 00:03:14.727
<i> and kind of forgot about it.</i>

00:03:14.727 --> 00:03:17.296
<i> And about a month later,
 I came back to the website</i>

00:03:17.296 --> 00:03:20.332
<i>where you can view your own data
 and see where you've been.</i>

00:03:20.332 --> 00:03:23.569
<i> And I realized that this data
 that I was tracking</i>

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:25.871
<i> represents something that's
 fundamentally important to me</i>

00:03:25.871 --> 00:03:27.673
<i> which is my
 own personal narrative.</i>

00:03:27.673 --> 00:03:30.509
The actual story of my life.

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:32.678
And... and with the website
you can

00:03:32.678 --> 00:03:34.113
make a couple of
different comparisons

00:03:34.113 --> 00:03:36.949
with it, it's a really
straight forward visualization.

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:39.284
But thinking about
what this data is

00:03:39.284 --> 00:03:41.987
started to bring me towards
what I think is

00:03:41.987 --> 00:03:44.190
the most important question
in my practice

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.659
which is, "how can I build
a personal relationship

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:48.928
between me and my data?"

00:03:48.928 --> 00:03:52.331
And my goal and the goal
with this project is to

00:03:52.331 --> 00:03:54.066
remind us of that and also to

00:03:54.066 --> 00:03:58.737
bring that gulf between
data and humans closer together.

00:03:58.737 --> 00:04:01.040
<i> Now, in this
 closeness that to...</i>

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.809
<i> the wilderness that
 Steve described,</i>

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:05.878
<i> as much as I have tried
 to prepare myself for</i>

00:04:05.878 --> 00:04:08.948
<i> was impossible to prepare
 for the reality.</i>

00:04:08.948 --> 00:04:10.015
<i> So, this is us, we are</i>

00:04:10.015 --> 00:04:12.017
<i> strapped in, in these
 portage harnesses</i>

00:04:12.017 --> 00:04:13.686
<i>and we are pulling these mokoro</i>

00:04:13.686 --> 00:04:18.357
<i> some of which weigh well over
 500 pounds through sticky mud.</i>

00:04:18.357 --> 00:04:20.292
<i> The reeds are razor sharp,</i>

00:04:20.292 --> 00:04:23.863
our legs are covered
in blood and leeches.

00:04:23.863 --> 00:04:26.665
It's 110 degrees and, and...

00:04:26.665 --> 00:04:31.804
and we really have become
one with this environment.

00:04:31.804 --> 00:04:35.641
But at the same time our
goal, Shah's goal, my goal

00:04:35.641 --> 00:04:38.444
<i> was to collect data at
 every moment that we can.</i>

00:04:38.444 --> 00:04:40.613
<i> So, this is Shah
 in his field station,</i>

00:04:40.613 --> 00:04:42.348
<i> an upturned
 Tupperware bin</i>

00:04:42.348 --> 00:04:44.750
<i> and he is recording water
 quality measurements</i>

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.253
<i> that we then upload
 to our website.</i>

00:04:47.253 --> 00:04:49.254
<i> And we would also in the
 evening, we would</i>

00:04:49.254 --> 00:04:53.025
<i> try to get as much of the
 record of the day as we could</i>

00:04:53.025 --> 00:04:55.427
<i> sorted out and depending
 on our bandwidth analysis,</i>

00:04:55.427 --> 00:04:56.996
<i> get that up into the website.</i>

00:04:56.996 --> 00:04:59.965
And what we were trying to do, I
think, for the first time was

00:04:59.965 --> 00:05:02.668
to build a truly live
data expedition.

00:05:02.668 --> 00:05:04.169
<i> Now these little
 colorful dots that</i>

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:06.772
<i> you've been seeing on the side
 of the screen are actually</i>

00:05:06.772 --> 00:05:09.275
<i> data points that we collected
 during the expedition.</i>

00:05:09.275 --> 00:05:12.712
<i> Each one of them representing
 a sighting of a species.</i>

00:05:12.712 --> 00:05:14.947
<i> So, as we are traveling
 down the river,</i>

00:05:14.947 --> 00:05:17.116
<i> something amazing was
 happening and that was</i>

00:05:17.116 --> 00:05:19.384
<i> with every data point
 that we were collecting</i>

00:05:19.384 --> 00:05:22.254
<i> was uploaded via satellite
 to the website</i>

00:05:22.254 --> 00:05:24.123
<i> generally within
 five to ten minutes</i>

00:05:24.123 --> 00:05:25.824
<i> and it was available
 to the public.</i>

00:05:25.824 --> 00:05:27.392
<i> So the public could
 not only see</i>

00:05:27.392 --> 00:05:29.328
<i> those data points appearing
 on the map</i>

00:05:29.328 --> 00:05:30.863
<i> they could use them
 in their research,</i>

00:05:30.863 --> 00:05:32.998
<i> they could use them
 in their classrooms</i>

00:05:32.998 --> 00:05:35.268
<i> and our goal here
 was to try to bring</i>

00:05:35.268 --> 00:05:36.769
<i> the wilderness to
 the real world.</i>

00:05:36.769 --> 00:05:38.471
<i> So this is how it'd work.</i>

00:05:38.471 --> 00:05:40.906
<i> This is an African Skimmer,
 actually quite a rare bird.</i>

00:05:40.906 --> 00:05:43.342
<i> It has an adaptation in it's
 beak which allows it to</i>

00:05:43.342 --> 00:05:46.746
<i> skim the surface and catch
 insects from the water.</i>

00:05:46.746 --> 00:05:50.182
<i> So, we may stumble upon
 three African Skimmers</i>

00:05:50.182 --> 00:05:51.383
<i> and Steve would say</i>

00:05:51.383 --> 00:05:53.552
Steve:<i> Three Skimmers.</i>

00:05:53.552 --> 00:05:55.120
Jer Thorp:<i> Giles, who is sitting
 in front of him</i>

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.822
<i> in the boat, would use</i>

00:05:56.822 --> 00:06:00.426
<i> a custom made Android app
that we built for the expedition</i>

00:06:00.426 --> 00:06:03.396
<i> to report this sighting
 of three Skimmers.</i>

00:06:03.396 --> 00:06:07.166
That would send the data
to a little Raspberry Pi.

00:06:07.166 --> 00:06:09.435
A Raspberry Pi is a
$30 computer that

00:06:09.435 --> 00:06:11.370
we built inside of a
little pelican case

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:13.672
<i> that sat in the
 back of the boat.</i>

00:06:13.672 --> 00:06:15.308
<i> And that little antenna
 that you see</i>

00:06:15.308 --> 00:06:17.076
<i> is talking up to
 the satellite.</i>

00:06:17.076 --> 00:06:19.812
<i> So the data would immediately
 be sent up to the satellite</i>

00:06:19.812 --> 00:06:23.115
<i> to the website, where it
 would appear for the public.</i>

00:06:23.115 --> 00:06:24.517
<i> It's something that
 we're really proud of</i>

00:06:24.517 --> 00:06:27.953
<i>because it allows people at any
 point during the expedition</i>

00:06:27.953 --> 00:06:32.091
<i> to come in and really feel
 what this experience is like</i>

00:06:32.091 --> 00:06:34.426
<i> to understand the
 time-based nature of it,</i>

00:06:34.426 --> 00:06:35.861
<i> to understand the
 difference between</i>

00:06:35.861 --> 00:06:38.231
<i> these sparse Papyrus canals</i>

00:06:38.231 --> 00:06:40.632
<i> that we were travelling
 through the first days</i>

00:06:40.632 --> 00:06:44.136
<i> to the central delta where
 the wildlife concentrations</i>

00:06:44.136 --> 00:06:48.340
<i> are bigger and denser than
almost any other place on Earth.</i>

00:06:49.141 --> 00:06:53.579
This is the fundamental
idea of the project.

00:06:53.579 --> 00:06:56.415
Can we turn the idea
on its head that

00:06:56.415 --> 00:06:59.786
the reason why scientists
go into-- go into the field,

00:06:59.786 --> 00:07:02.355
the reason why they go on
expeditions is so that

00:07:02.355 --> 00:07:06.225
they can gather data that
no other scientist has.

00:07:06.225 --> 00:07:08.126
And that's the
fundamental reason

00:07:08.126 --> 00:07:10.495
why expeditions are
appealing to scientists.

00:07:10.495 --> 00:07:12.765
Because they are going to be
able to get access to something

00:07:12.765 --> 00:07:14.466
that nobody else has seen.

00:07:14.466 --> 00:07:16.602
So, with our project,
we flipped that.

00:07:16.602 --> 00:07:19.705
Right away,
as soon as we're making our
measurements in the field

00:07:19.705 --> 00:07:22.040
this data is available
not only to our team

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:23.609
but to any other research team

00:07:23.609 --> 00:07:26.012
who may not have the budget
to get into the Okavango

00:07:26.012 --> 00:07:27.012
and to anybody else

00:07:27.012 --> 00:07:29.081
who is interested in this
wilderness area.

00:07:29.081 --> 00:07:30.082
So, what you're
seeing here is

00:07:30.082 --> 00:07:32.351
every species
sighting that we saw

00:07:32.351 --> 00:07:35.154
<i> along the actual track
 of the expedition.</i>

00:07:35.154 --> 00:07:36.922
<i> So we can look for
 pattern in species</i>

00:07:36.922 --> 00:07:39.091
<i> we can see how this is
 changing over time.</i>

00:07:39.091 --> 00:07:41.193
<i> And the idea is to
 build this tool</i>

00:07:41.193 --> 00:07:43.629
<i> into something that
 anybody can use.</i>

00:07:43.629 --> 00:07:46.332
<i> Our number one focus is
 to make all this open.</i>

00:07:46.332 --> 00:07:48.400
<i> We are also building
 these sensor platforms.</i>

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:51.103
<i> These are a couple
 of the sensor platforms</i>

00:07:51.103 --> 00:07:52.237
<i> before they were deployed.</i>

00:07:52.237 --> 00:07:54.473
<i> This is one of
 the test sensor platforms</i>

00:07:54.473 --> 00:07:55.908
<i> after it's been deployed.</i>

00:07:55.908 --> 00:07:58.244
And if I had my cell phone
with me, I don't right now,

00:07:58.244 --> 00:08:01.146
I can actually go and look at
the API right now and I can get

00:08:01.146 --> 00:08:03.982
an accurate pH and temperature
measurement from this

00:08:03.982 --> 00:08:06.752
body of water in the Okavango
from right here on stage

00:08:06.752 --> 00:08:08.754
and anybody can do that.

00:08:08.754 --> 00:08:10.923
And next year we are hoping
to deploy a network of up to

00:08:10.923 --> 00:08:14.893
fifty of these sensors
throughout the delta
so anybody...

00:08:14.893 --> 00:08:18.964
scientists, the curious, can get
a look at this ecosystem.

00:08:18.964 --> 00:08:20.232
One of our challenges is

00:08:20.232 --> 00:08:24.069
how do we get more people
involved in this project.

00:08:24.069 --> 00:08:26.705
And one of the things that we've
been working on with Shah

00:08:26.705 --> 00:08:29.141
is to take the
underlying infrastructure

00:08:29.141 --> 00:08:31.677
of the "Into The Okavango"
project and to release it

00:08:31.677 --> 00:08:33.245
as a fundamentally
open source project

00:08:33.245 --> 00:08:36.148
that any other
expeditionary scientist can use.

00:08:36.148 --> 00:08:37.649
<i> So, we're starting to
 work on this right now.</i>

00:08:37.649 --> 00:08:40.619
<i> The "Open Data Field Kit"
 will be available to anybody</i>

00:08:40.619 --> 00:08:43.422
<i>to be able to do the same things
 that we're doing in the delta</i>

00:08:43.422 --> 00:08:46.592
<i> other wilderness areas,
 in other urban areas, so that</i>

00:08:46.592 --> 00:08:48.394
data could be something that

00:08:48.394 --> 00:08:51.297
automatically gets shared
with the public.

00:08:51.297 --> 00:08:54.767
And our intent here is to
produce a data legacy.

00:08:54.767 --> 00:08:57.503
We want to produce a data
legacy for everybody.

00:08:57.503 --> 00:08:59.939
For teachers, for students,
for artists, for designers

00:08:59.939 --> 00:09:04.143
for researchers, for anybody who
wants to use this information.

00:09:04.143 --> 00:09:07.446
Because as important as our
travels into the delta are,

00:09:07.446 --> 00:09:09.948
they are going to have
limited impact

00:09:09.948 --> 00:09:13.219
if we can't get this out
to everybody.

00:09:13.219 --> 00:09:14.953
And it's simple
to get involved.

00:09:14.953 --> 00:09:17.123
You can follow us on, on...

00:09:17.123 --> 00:09:20.259
on our Twitter feed which is
"@IntoTheOkavango".

00:09:20.259 --> 00:09:21.793
You can follow the website.

00:09:21.793 --> 00:09:24.563
And together we can try
to bring these three

00:09:24.563 --> 00:09:27.466
seemingly disparate
things together.

00:09:29.067 --> 00:09:33.205
- Now... I know I didn't finish.
- ( audience laughter )

00:09:35.207 --> 00:09:39.478
We're all wearing these
heart-rate sensors on our arms

00:09:39.478 --> 00:09:43.115
which are recording
our biometrics and--

00:09:43.115 --> 00:09:44.449
( chuckles )

00:09:44.449 --> 00:09:49.221
So, I actually do have an exact
record of what it's like

00:09:49.221 --> 00:09:51.256
to be charged by a hippo.

00:09:51.256 --> 00:09:53.725
And I'm going to let you
listen to it. So...

00:09:53.725 --> 00:09:57.296
- I'm on the right
- ( audience laughter )

00:09:57.296 --> 00:10:01.066
and you are going to hear the
actual in-time heartbeat.

00:10:01.066 --> 00:10:03.335
I'm going to start it and it's
going to pause for a second

00:10:03.335 --> 00:10:06.171
and then it's going to play
up to when the hippo charges.

00:10:06.171 --> 00:10:07.506
I'm not even going to
tell you what time it is

00:10:07.506 --> 00:10:08.440
because it's obvious.

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:13.846 line:0%
( heart-rate monitor beeps )

00:10:14.246 --> 00:10:21.086 line:0%
( monitor beeps faster )

00:10:21.086 --> 00:10:25.957 line:0%
( beeps getting even faster )

00:10:25.957 --> 00:10:30.096 line:0%
( beeps getting even faster )

00:10:32.131 --> 00:10:33.365
( audience laughter )

00:10:33.365 --> 00:10:35.134
Now, I want to point
something out

00:10:35.134 --> 00:10:36.802
because Steve is
sitting right here.

00:10:36.802 --> 00:10:38.870
He said that he was
concerned about me

00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:40.105
but look at his heart-rate.

00:10:40.105 --> 00:10:42.408
( audience laughter )

00:10:42.408 --> 00:10:45.077
He's cool as a cucumber
over there

00:10:45.077 --> 00:10:46.645
in the front boat.

00:10:46.645 --> 00:10:50.016
And I hope this leaves us with
an example and a reminder

00:10:50.016 --> 00:10:52.685
of the things that we can
do through this project

00:10:52.685 --> 00:10:54.420
and through changing our
understanding of data

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:56.922
to bring us from a place,
where this information

00:10:56.922 --> 00:10:59.358
is something made by machines,
this information that

00:10:59.358 --> 00:11:01.827
is something that is
cold and numerical,

00:11:01.827 --> 00:11:04.797
to being something that can be
shared, can be talked about,

00:11:04.797 --> 00:11:07.166
can be performed, can
be used to tell stories,

00:11:07.166 --> 00:11:10.302
can be used to teach,
can be used to inspire.

00:11:10.302 --> 00:11:13.705
As Steve said our mission in
the Okavango is critical.

00:11:13.705 --> 00:11:16.541
We have two years to
cha-- to make change,

00:11:16.541 --> 00:11:20.046
to make sure that this pristine
environment remains pristine

00:11:20.046 --> 00:11:23.682
and I can really think of
no more important goal.

00:11:23.682 --> 00:11:28.654
So, please join us as
we enter the Okavango again

00:11:28.654 --> 00:11:31.123
and follow along
with the experience,

00:11:31.123 --> 00:11:36.361
both through the data and
through your ability to...

00:11:36.361 --> 00:11:40.032
to connect to us as
explorers and we hope that

00:11:40.032 --> 00:11:42.468
we'll have some more stories
to tell for you next year.

00:11:42.468 --> 00:11:43.468
Thank you.

00:11:43.468 --> 00:11:46.839
( applause )
