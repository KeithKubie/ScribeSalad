- Hey, Sam.

00:00:12.411 --> 00:00:15.148
This is Bruce from
1-2-3 Warehouse.

00:00:15.181 --> 00:00:17.950
Just a new client to I've added
to our portfolio.

00:00:17.983 --> 00:00:21.287
I know he's just a small fish,
but still fun to reel in.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.823
- I'm not a small fish.
- But you are, you are.

00:00:23.856 --> 00:00:27.026
- Yeah, of course, Bruce,
welcome to Royals.

00:00:27.059 --> 00:00:28.961
- I ate here once before.

00:00:28.994 --> 00:00:30.763
- Well, then, welcome back.

00:00:30.796 --> 00:00:34.233
- Yep, just pitching Bruce
here some taglines.

00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:36.002
You know, closing the deal.

00:00:36.035 --> 00:00:37.270
You used to do that.

00:00:37.303 --> 00:00:39.439
Wanna sit in?
- No, Tim, I can't.

00:00:39.472 --> 00:00:40.940
But you've got this.

00:00:40.973 --> 00:00:42.909
Bruce, you're
in excellent hands.

00:00:42.942 --> 00:00:45.311
Enjoy your meals, fellas.
It's on me.

00:00:45.344 --> 00:00:47.380
- Oh.
- Not the booze, though.

00:00:51.484 --> 00:00:54.253 align:end position:100%
- So I was wrong,
he's not gonna join us.

00:00:54.286 --> 00:00:55.855 align:end position:100%
No worries,
I can do it myself.

00:00:55.888 --> 00:00:59.792 align:end position:100%
Uh, so we see beauty shots

"Where's the warehouse?

00:01:08.033 --> 00:01:11.170 align:end position:100%
It's as easy as
1-2-3 Warehouse."

00:01:11.203 --> 00:01:13.539 size:81% position:41%
- It's going to seem like
they're lost in the store.

00:01:13.572 --> 00:01:15.308 align:end position:100%
- Okay, you don't like that?
Here's another one.

"1-2-3 Warehouse,

00:01:16.742 --> 00:01:19.512 align:end position:100%
it's as easy
as A-B-C. Warehouse."

is A-B-C Warehouse.

- Uh, that's insane.

00:01:24.717 --> 00:01:25.952
- All right, well, just take
that off their check,

00:01:25.985 --> 00:01:27.487
and then give them
a free dessert.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.822
- Okay.
- Thanks, Darren.

00:01:29.855 --> 00:01:32.592
- Hey, don't grab me!
- I didn't grab you!

00:01:32.625 --> 00:01:34.827 align:end position:100%
You looked away
when I was talking to you.

I'm not gonna apologize for
something that I didn't do.

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:39.365

- Shirt!

00:01:39.398 --> 00:01:41.467 align:start size:56% position:44%
So you admit that
I didn't grab you!

- Uh, gentlemen, some wine
for the table.

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:51.444 align:start position:0%
Sorry to interrupt,
but how about something like

00:01:51.477 --> 00:01:55.982 align:start position:0%
"1-2-3 Warehouse:
you can count on us."

00:01:56.015 --> 00:01:59.352
- I love it.
Because you can count

00:01:59.385 --> 00:02:02.221
on 1-2-3.
That's perfect.

00:02:02.254 --> 00:02:04.690 align:end position:100%
- It is.
It is, perfect.

00:02:04.723 --> 00:02:08.427 align:end position:100%
Sam, come back.
Tell me you didn't get

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.163 align:start size:53% position:47%
a rush from that.

00:02:10.196 --> 00:02:11.497
Clients are coming in now.

Way better than this guy,
trust me.

00:02:13.632 --> 00:02:16.569
- Hey.
- Tim, I'm not coming back.

00:02:16.602 --> 00:02:18.604
Look, in ten years,
I'm gonna be managing

00:02:18.637 --> 00:02:20.173
four of these restaurants.

00:02:20.206 --> 00:02:22.241
And, hopefully,
Cramblin Duvet's the biggest

00:02:22.274 --> 00:02:26.612
ad agency in Detroit, but, Tim,
I can't gamble on hopefully.

00:02:26.645 --> 00:02:29.148
'Cause in 10 years my kid's
gonna be nine,

00:02:29.181 --> 00:02:33.052
and, if he's anything like me,
he's gonna need braces

00:02:33.085 --> 00:02:37.290
for his legs
'cause his dick's so big.

00:02:37.323 --> 00:02:39.025
Good luck, buddy.
I love ya.

00:02:39.058 --> 00:02:43.896 align:start size:47% position:53%
- Love you too.

00:02:43.929 --> 00:02:46.465 align:start size:50% position:50%
All right, okay,

00:02:46.498 --> 00:02:48.734 align:end position:100%
well, we can't
use "you can count on us"

00:02:48.767 --> 00:02:51.103 align:end position:100%
for legal reasons,
plus I refuse to do that.

00:02:51.136 --> 00:02:54.140 align:end position:100%
But I'll come up with
something just as good.

00:02:54.173 --> 00:02:56.375 align:start size:31% position:69%
Um, one...

00:02:56.408 --> 00:02:58.511 align:end position:100%
Look at me when
I'm talking to you!
