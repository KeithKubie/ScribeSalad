00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.840
DNA is what they call the molecule of life.

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.960
It carries the genetic code of an organism.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.760
And we're interested in the structure.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.480
And the structure of DNA is a right-handed double helix.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:20.640
where each one of the strings that form the helix
is made of a sugar group and a phosphate group

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.600
alternating - sugar-phosphate, sugar-phosphate,...
And that's called the backbone.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.320
To each sugar-phosphate group is attached a nitrogenous base - just call it a base.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:39.180
And the bases in the two backbones pair, A with T and C with G, and they are held together with hydrogen bonds.

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:50.200
For each turn of the helix - so this would be a full turn of the helix - you will expect to have 10.5 base pairs/turn,

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:58.900
in what we call B DNA. It is important to note that this
is right handed for the DNA that is in most organisms.

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:06.100
If we put the DNA of all the chromosomes in the human genome together, we have more than 3 billion base pairs.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.420
Three billion base pairs of DNA
measure approximately two meters.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:16.240
All that DNA fits into one very small cell,
that is 10 micrometers in diameter.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.780
Every cell in your body has two meters of DNA in it.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:28.060
And, you can imagine then what an important problem it is to package this DNA in such a way that is easily

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:35.740
accessible for all the cellular transactions; and at the same time it doesn't overflow, or put too much stress

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.900
on the cell, because of the sheer
amount of genetic material in there.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:46.940
So, in my case, I like to study the geometrical
and topological properties of DNA.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:54.680
So, even though we are able to model DNA in its...
in all its atomistic detail - into going atom

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.800
by atom and looking at forces and interactions -

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:05.580
we're not so much interested in that; we're interested in looking at DNA as either a ribbon, or just as a curve.

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:12.140
When we model DNA as a curve, we're talking about
the curve drawn by the axis of the double helix.

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:19.400
So this DNA molecule will be modeled as just a curve that is properly embedded in three dimensional space.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:27.000
So we can model DNA in the atomistic detail, or we can look at it from further away and model it as a ribbon

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.060
where each one of the sugar-phosphate backbones
is one of the boundaries of the ribbon.

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.180
So you will have a boundary curve that is blue,
and a boundary curve that is red.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.680
Still, the axis of the ribbon is this pink curve.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:46.480
And the advantage of modeling it as a ribbon is that, then, you can measure the torsion of this DNA molecule,

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.800
as it writhes in space,
and as it's packaged in organisms.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:59.140
If you just model DNA - so you go further down in the level of resolution - and you model DNA as a single curve

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:05.540
that does not self-intersect, then we can start
asking questions about topological entanglement.

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.820
And how much this curve wraps around itself.

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:12.600
In the human genome, the chromosomes
are linear pieces of DNA.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:18.040
If we look at the chromosomes of bacteria
- a bacterial cell will have a single chromosome,

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.320
and that chromosome is circular.

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:29.560
So, no ends to deal with, and just one circle of DNA - also very long - that has to be packaged inside the cell.

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.860
- Are they like a tangled mess, or are they packed in like neat coils...? Would you describe those things

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.640
as messy or neat?

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:43.040
- Well, that's a wonderful question..!
So... it depends! Think about the human DNA...

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:49.980
These curves will wrap around proteins called histones, and form some sort of bead necklace.

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.640
And then these bead necklace...
and it will coil upon itself, so...

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.840
- So it's a coil of a coil...?
- It's a coil of a coil of a coil of a coil of a coil...

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:06.840
So if we look here at the diameter of the native DNA
- so the diameter here is 2 nanometers.

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:13.220
Here, the diameter is approximately 10 nanometers.
And then there's higher levels of coiling,

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:18.960
until you get to the representation
that you saw in your high school biology

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:24.800
where the chromosomes are very highly organized
and very tightly packed like that.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:31.060
Now if we look at the cell cycle for a human cell,
the chromosome don't always look like that.

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:37.320
The chromosomes look like that at metaphase
- right before the cell is going to separate into two cells.

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:45.360
But at the first stage of the cell cycle...
So if we consider the cell cycle as starting here,

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:51.000
this is what we call the G-naught/G-one phase
of the cell cycle - or interphase.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:57.120
Then there is the s-phase - where replication takes place. There is G-2... and the metaphase...

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.120
and right here we will have cell division.

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:07.900
If we focus at the interphase, DNA is a tangled mess. But there must be some organization in there...

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:12.160
Because if it was a completely random tangled mess,

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:17.140
then you can imagine that the cell
would not function properly.

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:23.420
So there is some organization. But if we zoom in
and look at the cell at this stage of the cell cycle,

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:30.240
we can see the different chromosomes that look
like noodles, but they occupy distinct territories

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:37.400
within the cell nucleus. And then, you're looking here... What the question is 'is there organization here?',

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:45.220
'is there interaction between chromosomes?', 'are some chromosomes more likely to be found on the periphery

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:51.500
of the cell nucleus?', 'are some chromsomes more likely to be found in... toward the center of the cell nucleus?', ...

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.620
All those are important questions.

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.700
- How can a mathematician
even begin to think about this?!

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:02.980
- Well, we start... simply find the problem...
We start looking at DNA as a curve.

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:09.140
So each one of these chromosomes will
now be just a curve - no sequence,  no helix...,

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:17.300
no complexity other than this very long curve
embedded in a very small environment.

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:23.980
And then we can use polymer models. We can model these in the computer where the curve is still having

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:29.480
a smooth parametrization: for each one of these curves, we turn these curves into polygonal curves...

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:33.580
It will be just a bunch of vertices and edges.

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:38.820
And these polygonal curves can have different properties. But you can imagine that, by doing this,

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:44.220
we have simplified the problem dramatically:
now we just have a sequence of vertices

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:51.560
and their coordinates in space, and the knowledge that vertex-1 connects to vertex-2 connects to vertex-3, etc.

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:57.880
When we have a circular chromosome, then vertex-n
will connect back to 1. And we can put a restriction

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:01.860
that the edges be of same length,
so that we have an equilateral chain.

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:07.180
Now we can put restrictions on the chain, and we
can approximate the behaviour of a DNA molecule

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:09.020
using a polygonal chain.

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:15.400
So, if you have a circle like this, and then, well...
it can be moving in space just by thermal motion.

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:21.540
And we are interested in finding all conformation,
not just the circle that could lay flat on the table.

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:25.760
Does it coil upon itself? If so, how many times
does it coil upon itself?

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:33.380
Or these circles could be knotted,
so the knot could look nice and fat like that,

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:39.960
But the knot could also be a very tight knot,
or it could have some coiling about it,

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:46.320
where if you looked at it, you would not recognize
its identity; but it's still exactly the same knot.

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:52.620
So we want to explore the space of possible conformations for a given topology,

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:56.820
be it an open circle or a trefoil knot like this one.

00:07:56.820 --> 00:08:04.060
And then apply that knowledge to the models of packing. Now, if we take a very long chain,

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:10.480
and we allow it to move in three dimensional space,
we can measure geometrical properties, like

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:16.240
the writhe, which measures the amount of coiling of this curve around itself; or we could measure the radius of

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:23.000
of gyration, which intuitively is the radius of
the smallest sphere that contains this chain.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:31.700
If we do that, then we can apply that directly to
a chromosome, and think 'well, what is the space that

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:36.720
a chromosome could occupy if it wasn't constrained, if it wasn't in three dimensional space?'

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:42.680
Well, a chromosome would occupy such space if it was in three dimensional space. And then we compare that to

00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:48.340
to the space that it occupies in the nucleus. And that gives us some measure of the amount of compaction

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:53.800
this chain is undergoing
as it's packaged inside the cell nucleus.
