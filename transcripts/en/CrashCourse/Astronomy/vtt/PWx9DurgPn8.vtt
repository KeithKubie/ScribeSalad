00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:08.180
Stars are in a constant struggle between gravity
trying to collapse them and their internal

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:14.320
heat trying to inflate them. For most of a star’s
life, these two forces are at an uneasy truce.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.090
For a star like the Sun, the balance tips
in its twilight years. For a brief glorious

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:24.040
moment it expands… but then blows away its
outer layers, leaving behind the gravitationally

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:29.380
compressed core. It goes out with a whimper.
Well, a whimper from a two octillion ton barely

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.980
constrained nuclear powered fireball.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.120
But more massive stars aren’t quite as resigned
to their fate. When they go out, they go out

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.620
with a bang -- a very, very big bang.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.199
In the core of a star, pressure and temperature
are high enough that atomic nuclei can get

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:01.819
squeezed together and fuse. This releases
energy, and creates heavier elements. Hydrogen

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:07.120
fusion makes helium, helium fusion makes carbon,
and each heavier element, in general, takes

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.360
higher temperatures and pressures to fuse.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.300
Lower-mass stars like the Sun stop at carbon.
Once that builds up in the core, the star’s fate is sealed.

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:20.180
But if the star has more than about 8 times
the Sun’s mass, it can create temperatures

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:27.160
in its core in excess of 500 million degrees Celsius,
and then carbon will fuse. There are actually a lot

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:33.160
of steps in this process, but in the end you get carbon
fusing into neon, magnesium, and some sodium.

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.870
What happens next hearkens back to what we
found goes on in the Sun’s core as it ages:

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:41.130
fuse an element, create a heavier one, then
that heavier one builds up until the core

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.340
contracts and heats up enough to start
fusing it. So carbon fusion makes neon,

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.600
magnesium, and sodium, and those accumulate.
The core heats up, and when it reaches

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:56.320
about a billion degrees, neon will fuse. Neon fusion
creates more magnesium, as well as some oxygen.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:02.380
These build up in the core, it shrinks, heats
up to about 1.5 billion degrees, and then

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.370
oxygen fuses, creating silicon. Then THAT
builds up until the temperature hits about

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:10.950
2-3 billion degrees, whereupon silicon can
fuse.

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:18.060
Among a pile of other elements, silicon fusion
creates iron. And that’s trouble. Big, big

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:22.589
trouble. Once silicon fusion stars, the star
is a ticking time bomb.

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:26.960
But before we light that fuse, let’s take
a step back. What’s happening to the outer

00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:31.049
layers of the star? What do we see if we’re
outside, looking back at it?

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:36.209
Because the star was born massive, it spent
its hydrogen fusing days as a blue main sequence

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:40.709
star. Stars like this are extremely luminous,
and can be seen for tremendous distances.

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:46.229
Like the Sun, though, a massive star changes
when hydrogen fusion stops, its core contracts,

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:50.800
and then helium fusion begins. It swells up
just as the Sun will, but instead of becoming

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.730
a red giant, it generates so much energy it
becomes a red supergiant.

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:01.980
These are incredibly huge stars, some over
a billion kilometers across! And they are

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.099
luminous. For example, Betelgeuse in Orion
is a red supergiant, and one of the brightest

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:12.420
stars in the sky despite being over 600 light
years away. From that distance, you’d need

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.519
a decent telescope to see the Sun at all.
And that’s nothing compared to VY Canis

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:23.670
Majoris, the largest known star, which is
a staggering two billion kilometers across.

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.610
We even have a special term for it: a hypergiant.

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:31.380
As the core switches back and forth from one
fusion reaction to the next the outer layers

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:37.140
respond by contracting and expanding, so a red
supergiant can shrink and become a BLUE supergiant.

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:44.220
Rigel, another star in Orion, is a blue supergiant, putting
out over 100,000 times as much energy as the Sun!

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:49.269
OK, let’s go back to the core. It now looks
like an onion, with multiple layers: iron

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:53.439
is building up in the center, surrounded by
fusing silicon. Outside that is a layer of

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:58.179
fusing oxygen, then neon, then carbon, then
helium, and finally hydrogen.

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.880
You might think massive stars would last longer
because they have more fuel than lower mass

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:07.300
stars. But the cores of these monsters are
far hotter, and fuse elements are far higher

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:09.559
rates, running out of fuel more quickly.

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:14.400
A star like the Sun can happily fuse hydrogen
into helium for over 10 billion years. But

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.549
a star twice as massive as the Sun runs out
of hydrogen in just 2 billion years. A star

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:23.329
with 8 times the Sun’s mass runs out in
only 100 million years or so.

00:04:23.329 --> 00:04:28.419
And each step in the fusion process happens
faster than the one before it. In an extreme

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:33.180
case, like for a star 20 times the mass of
the Sun, it’ll fuse helium for about a million

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:39.160
years, carbon for about a thousand, and neon
fusion will use up all its fuel in a single year!

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.700
Oxygen lasts for only a few months.

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:47.420
Silicon fuses at a ridiculously high rate;
the star will go through its entire supply

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:54.680
in — get this — a day. Yes, one day. The
vast majority of a star’s life is spent

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.440
fusing hydrogen; the rest happens in a metaphorical
blink of the eye.

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:03.180
Silicon fuses into a bunch of different elements,
including iron. That inert iron builds up

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.280
in the core, just like all those elements
did before, and just like before the iron

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.090
core shrinks and heats up.

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:11.090
But there’s a huge difference here.

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:16.850
In all the previous fusion stages, energy
is created. That energy transforms into heat,

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:20.670
and that helps support the soul-crushing amount
of stellar mass above the core.

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:25.680
But iron is different. When it fuses it actually
sucks up energy instead of creating it. Instead

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:30.600
of providing energy for the star, it removes
it. This accelerates the shrinking, compressing

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.800
the core, heating it up even more.

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:37.740
Even worse, at these temperatures and pressures
the iron nuclei suck up electrons that are

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:43.259
whizzing around, which are also helping support
the core. It’s a double whammy; both major

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:47.879
means of support for the star are removed
in an instant — silicon fusing into iron is

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:52.930
happening so fast this literally takes a fraction
of a second once it gets started.

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:57.450
The core gets its legs kicked out from under
it. It doesn’t shrink, it collapses.

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:02.379
The gravity of the core is so mind-bogglingly
strong that the outer parts crash down on

00:06:02.379 --> 00:06:06.729
the inner parts at a significant fraction
of the speed of light. This slams down on

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:11.030
the central core, collapsing from several
hundred kilometers across down to a couple

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:15.590
of dozen kilometers across in just a few thousandths
of a second!

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:19.730
The star is doomed. Because all hell is about
to break loose.

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:24.330
Now, at this point, one of two things can
happen. If the star has less than about 20

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:28.530
times the Sun’s mass, the core collapse
stops when it’s still 20 or so kilometers

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:32.500
wide. It forms what’s called a neutron star,
which I’ll cover in the next episode.

00:06:32.509 --> 00:06:37.379
If the star is more massive than this, then
the collapse cannot be stopped by any force

00:06:37.379 --> 00:06:43.340
in the Universe. The core collapses all the
way down. Down to a point. The gravity becomes

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:45.940
so intense that not even light can escape.

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:47.500
A black hole is born.

00:06:47.509 --> 00:06:52.249
We’ll cover black holes in a future episode
as well. But for now, what happens when the

00:06:52.249 --> 00:06:54.549
core collapses and suddenly stops?

00:06:54.549 --> 00:06:59.760
The core of the star, whether it’s a neutron
star or a black hole, is now extremely small

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:05.930
with terrifyingly strong gravity. It pulls on
the star’s matter above it, HARD. This stuff

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:11.810
comes crashing down at a fantastic speed and
gets hugely compressed, ferociously heating up.

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:16.560
At the same time, two things happen in the
core. While this stuff is falling in, a monster

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:21.569
shock wave created by the collapse of the
core moves outward, and slams into the incoming

00:07:21.569 --> 00:07:26.769
material. The explosive energy is so insane
it slows that material substantially.

00:07:26.769 --> 00:07:31.340
The second event is that the complicated quantum
physics brewing in the core generates vast

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:36.560
numbers of subatomic particles called neutrinos.
The total energy carried by these little neutrinos

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:42.220
is almost beyond reason: In a fraction of
a second, they carry away 100 times as much

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:46.560
energy as the Sun will produce over its entire
lifetime

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:51.860
That’s an incredible amount of energy. Now,
these little beasties are seriously elusive

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:55.990
and hate to interact with normal matter; one
single neutrino could pass through trillions

00:07:55.990 --> 00:08:00.630
of kilometers of lead without even noticing. But
so many are created in the core collapse,

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:05.890
and the material barreling down on the core
so dense, that a huge number of them are absorbed.

00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:11.060
This vast wave of neutrinos slams into the
oncoming material like a bullet train hitting

00:08:11.069 --> 00:08:16.789
a slice of warm butter. The material stops
its infall, reverses course, and blasts outward.

00:08:16.789 --> 00:08:21.549
The star explodes. It explodes.

00:08:21.549 --> 00:08:26.400
This is called a supernova, and it is one
of the most violent and terrifying events

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:31.879
the Universe can offer. An entire star tears
itself to shreds, and the expanding gas blasts

00:08:31.879 --> 00:08:37.370
outward at 10% the speed of light. The energy
released is so huge they can be seen literally

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:42.130
halfway across the Universe; they outshine
all the stars in the rest of the galaxy combined.

00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:47.180
The expanding material, called the supernova
remnant, forms fantastic shapes. The most

00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:51.930
famous is the Crab nebula, from a star we
saw blow up in the year 1054. The tendrils

00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:56.450
form as the material expands into the gas
and dust that surrounded the progenitor star.

00:08:56.450 --> 00:09:01.220
As remnants expand and age they become more
tenuous. Some have bright rims as they push

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:05.120
into material between the stars; others form
complex webs of filaments.

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:09.300
I’m often asked if there are any stars near
enough to hurt us when they explode. The quick

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:16.130
answer is no. Even though supernovae are incredibly
violent, space is big. A supernova would have

00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:20.930
to be at least as close as 100 light years
from us before we start feeling any real effects.

00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:25.540
The nearest star that might explode in this
way is Spica, in Virgo, and it’s well over

00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:29.820
100 light years away. I say “might” explode,
because it’s at the lower mass limit for

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:32.160
going supernova. It might not explode at all.

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:35.820
Betelgeuse will certainly explode some day,
but it's too far away to hurt us.

00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:37.820
We're pretty safe from this particular threat.

00:09:37.829 --> 00:09:42.669
I’ll note that after all this, there IS
another kind of supernova involving white

00:09:42.669 --> 00:09:47.620
dwarfs, which we’ll cover in a future episode
about binary stars. Happily, we’re probably

00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:49.690
safe from them too. Breathe easy.

00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:53.880
As terrifying and dangerous as supernovae
are, there’s a very important aspect of

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:57.840
them you need to know. Supernovae
are capable of great destruction,

00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:00.540
but they’re also critical for our own existence.

00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:06.040
When the star explodes, the gas gets so hot
and is compressed so violently by the blast

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:11.540
that it undergoes fusion, what astronomers
call explosive nucleosynthesis: Literally,

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:13.620
creating heavy elements explosively.

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:18.519
New elements are produced in quantities that
dwarf the Earth’s mass. Calcium, phosphorus,

00:10:18.519 --> 00:10:24.459
nickel, more iron… all made in the hellish forge of the
supernova heat, and flung outward into the Universe.

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:29.839
It takes millennia or longer, but this material
mixes with the other gas and dust clouds floating

00:10:29.839 --> 00:10:34.529
in space. Sometimes, these clouds will be
actively forming stars — sometimes the collapse

00:10:34.529 --> 00:10:39.560
of the cloud to form stars may even be triggered
by the supernova slamming into it! Either way, the

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:44.820
heavy elements created in the supernova will become
part of the next generation of stars and planets.

00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:49.960
Supernovae are how the majority of heavy elements
in the Universe are created and scattered.

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:55.600
The calcium in your bones? The iron in your
blood? The phosphorus in your DNA? All created

00:10:55.610 --> 00:11:01.030
in the heart of the titanic death of a star.
That star blew up more than 5 billion years

00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:04.041
ago, but parts of it go on in you.

00:11:04.041 --> 00:11:07.440
Today you learned that massive stars fuse
heavier elements in their cores than lower

00:11:07.449 --> 00:11:12.839
mass stars. This leads to the creation of
heavier elements up to iron. Iron robs critical

00:11:12.839 --> 00:11:17.470
energy from the core, causing it to collapse.
The shock wave, together with a huge swarm

00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:22.470
of neutrinos, blast through the star’s outer
layers, causing it to explode. The resulting

00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:27.560
supernova creates even more heavy elements,
scattering them through space. Also, happily,

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:30.160
we’re in no danger from a nearby supernova.

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:34.839
