00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:03.550
Let's use what we've learned
about finding the minimums and

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:06.950
maximums of functions to solve
some optimization problems.

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:09.160
And you might be wondering,
Sal, what is an

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:10.580
optimization problem.

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:13.310
And my reply to you is well,
the problems we're about to do

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:15.420
are optimization problems, and
I think you'll understand

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.610
why they're called
optimization problems.

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:20.810
Anyway so the first problem
is find two numbers whose

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:22.810
product is a negative 16.

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:29.030
So the product is
equal to minus 16.

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:33.520
And it says, and the sum of
whose squares is a minimum.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:41.820
So sum of squares is minimum.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.390
So if you haven't figured out
yet, these optimization

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:50.020
problems all impose some type
of constraints, and then say,

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.220
for what numbers do we get a
maximum value or minimum value.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.990
So let's do this problem, and
then we'll do a couple of more.

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:03.120
So two numbers whose product
is negative 16 and the sum

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.240
of their squares is minimum.

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:08.730
So call those two
numbers x and y.

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:12.610
So their product is minus
16, so we know that x times

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.870
y is equal to minus 16.

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:17.670
And then what's the
sum of their squares.

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.170
Let's just say the some
of squares, so I'll

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.050
just call that s.

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.010
The sum of their squares
is going to be equal to x

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:31.070
squared plus y squared.

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.240
And so this is the function
that we want to optimize.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.730
And in this case we want to
find the minimum value.

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:38.830
So how do we do this problem?

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.510
Well the first thing we want to
do, we want to minimize this

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.430
function, but right now it's a
function of two variables,

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.140
and we haven't done
multivariable calculus yet.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.970
So it would be easier if we
could express this as a

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.560
function of one variable, and
then we could optimize it with

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.475
respect that variable, and we
could substitute backwards

00:01:55.475 --> 00:01:56.240
et cetera, et cetera.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.620
So how can we write the
sum of the squares as a

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:59.980
function of one variable?

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.880
Well that's where this
equation comes in handy.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.700
We could substitute
either for x or y.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.890
Let's just substitute y, so we
could rewrite this equation

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:16.580
dividing both sides by x as y
is equal to minus 16 over x.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.120
I just divided both
sides of this by x.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.270
If we take this and substitute
it here, we get the sum of the

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.150
squares of the two numbers
is going to be equal to x

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.120
squared plus y squared.

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.380
Well y is this, so what's
this thing squared?

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:39.540
Minus 16 squared is
256 over x squared.

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.830
So that's the sum of the
squares of the two numbers.

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.940
And so how do we learn to find
minimums or maximums, or in

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.560
general optimize the function?

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.000
Well in general, a function
hits a minimum or maximum

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.480
point, especially a local
minimum or maximum point,

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.510
when it's derivative is 0.

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.450
So let's take the derivative of
this and set it equal to 0, and

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:01.990
hopefully we find
a minimum point.

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:04.670
And then we'll later show that
it really is a minimum point.

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.440
So let's take the derivative
of this with respect to x.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.880
I'll just write s prime.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.030
We could have written ds
dx, but save on notation.

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.965
Save on my electronic ink.

00:03:14.965 --> 00:03:19.610
So s prime is equal to-- so
there's a slope of this

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:25.410
function at any time, at any
x-- 2x plus-- this is the

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:30.720
same thing as 256 times
x to the negative 2.

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.270
So what will be the derivative?

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:37.070
The derivative is
going to be 256.

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:40.310
We multiply times exponent
which is minus 2, and then we

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:44.150
decrement the exponent by 1 ,
so we get x to the minus 3.

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:53.710
So the derivative is equal to
2x plus-- no, not plus-- 2x

00:03:53.710 --> 00:04:00.350
minus 512 times x
to the minus 3.

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:02.450
And we want to find a local
minimum or maximum, or

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:03.700
maybe a global one.

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.630
So we want to figure out where
the slope is equal to 0, so

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:09.410
this is the slope, so let's
set this equal to 0.

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:20.740
So we get 2x minus 512x to
the minus 3 is equal to 0.

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:23.850
Let's see, we can manipulate
that around a little bit.

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.700
We get 2x-- let me do it
in a different color,

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:28.680
I'm tired of the yellow.

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:38.740
So you get going up here, we
get-- just let's add 512 to

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:50.310
both sides-- so we get 2x is
equal to 512x to the minus 3,

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.190
right, I just added
512 to both sides.

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:55.840
Now let's multiply both sides
of this equation times x to the

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.150
third, just to get rid of this.

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.270
So if we multiply both sides
of this equation by x to

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:07.550
the third, we get 2x to the
fourth is equal to 512.

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:09.460
Right, x to the third
times x to the minus

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.070
3, that just equals 1.

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:13.720
Divide both sides of this
by 2, you get x to the

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.770
fourth is equal to 256.

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:21.510
And if it's not immediately
clear what this is-- you know,

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:23.950
x is going to be the fourth
root of 256-- if you don't know

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:26.040
that immediately, you can
think, well, what's the

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:27.780
square root of 256.

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:28.850
Well it's 16.

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:30.540
And then what's the
square root of that.

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:33.870
Well the square root of
16 is plus or minus.

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:36.335
So the square root of this is
plus or minus 16, but then

00:05:36.335 --> 00:05:40.070
a square root of at least a
plus 16 is plus or minus 4.

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:45.420
So this x is equal
to plus or minus 4.

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:48.130
If you don't believe me, take
either minus 4 or positive

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:51.580
4 and take it to the fourth
power and you will get 256.

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:55.160
So if x is plus or
minus 4, what is y?

00:05:55.160 --> 00:06:00.290
Well we just know that y
is minus 16 divided by x,

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:02.050
so we could get x is 4.

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:05.230
If x is 4, then what is y?

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:09.660
It's minus 16 divided by 4,
then y is equal to minus 4.

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:13.650
And of course if x was minus 4,
then y is minus 16 divided by

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:16.150
minus 4, y would be equal to 4.

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:18.200
So it actually doesn't
matter which one we take.

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:19.960
The two numbers are
4 and negative 4.

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:23.550
It doesn't matter what
we call them, x or y.

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:25.920
The two numbers are
4 and minus 4.

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:27.600
And we are actually
done the problem.

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.010
These are the two numbers where
the sum of the squares-- well

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:31.460
actually, no we, are not done.

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:35.010
We know that we've reached some
type of minimum or maximum

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:37.740
point here, and since they ask
for minimum, and this was the

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:41.160
only point that we found where
the slope was 0, we probably

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:42.250
solved the problem.

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:45.140
But let's prove to ourselves
that we're really at a minimum

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:50.420
point on this function
when x is equal to 4.

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:51.750
And how do we do that?

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:54.690
Well, we can take the second
derivative of this function,

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:57.400
see what the second derivative
is at x equals 4, and then see

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:01.590
if we're concave upwards
or concave downwards.

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:02.755
This is the first derivative.

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:10.063
What is the second derivative?

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:21.480
s prime prime is equal to 2,
and then minus 3 times minus

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:25.000
512, so that's plus,
and what is that?

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:34.020
1,536 Right, plus 1,536
times x to the minus 4.

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:44.700
I actually you know should be
writing s as a function of x.

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:47.350
I shouldn't be lazy
with my notation.

00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:49.400
These are all the function of
x, but you get the point.

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:56.160
So what is s prime prime
when x is equal to 4?

00:07:56.160 --> 00:08:01.350
Well it's equal
to 2 plus 1,536.

00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:03.950
And then what's 4 to
the minus 4 power?

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:07.790
We get 1/256.

00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:09.140
And we don't even have
to calculate this.

00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:11.160
All we care about is this
value positive or negative.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:12.295
It And it's clearly positive.

00:08:12.295 --> 00:08:14.480
We have a positive number plus
a positive number divided

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:15.080
by a positive number.

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:16.940
So we have a positive
number here.

00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:18.630
So what do we know?

00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:26.270
We know at the point x is equal
to 4, this function here-- our

00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:30.410
sum of squares function-- is
concave upwards, and we know

00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:32.650
that because the second
derivative at x is equal

00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:34.050
to 4 is positive.

00:08:34.050 --> 00:08:36.310
And what does concave
upwards look like?

00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:39.290
Concave upwards
looks like this.

00:08:39.290 --> 00:08:42.960
And so x equals 4 is there, and
so we are at a minimum point.

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:45.740
And so we know that the sum
of squares are minimum.

00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:48.520
And if you really want to make
sure that you're not missing

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:51.840
something or we haven't done
this wrong, just play around,

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:55.310
think of other numbers whose
product is minus 16 and figure

00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:56.540
out their sum of squares.

00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:59.910
And I can pretty much guarantee
you that it will be larger than

00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:03.540
the sum of the squares
of 4 of minus 4 and 4.

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:05.260
So actually, what are they?

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:06.590
What is s of 4?

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:08.960
What is the sum of squares
of 4 and minus 4?

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:13.340
It's 4 squared is
16 plus 16 is 32.

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:14.045
That's the sum.

00:09:14.045 --> 00:09:15.430
So let's try some
other numbers.

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:23.010
What is the sum of 1 squared
plus minus 16 squared.

00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:27.180
Those two have the product
minus 16, 1 and minus 16,

00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:28.020
that is equal to what?

00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:29.280
257.

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:30.300
Much higher number.

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:33.600
You could try negative 8 and
2, or negative 2 and 8, and

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:36.480
everything you'll find will
have a higher sum of squares

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:38.330
than 4 and minus 4.

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:39.710
Anyway.

00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:41.560
I was actually planning on
doing three problems in this

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:45.030
video, but I'm reaching the 10
minute limit so I will finish

00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:47.230
this video now, and I will
do two more of these

00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:47.960
optimization problems.

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:48.320
See you soon.
