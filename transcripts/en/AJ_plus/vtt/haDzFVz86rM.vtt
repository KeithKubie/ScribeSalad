00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.840
 The first diagnosis was pretty bad, you know.

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.560
 They were saying I could probably die within a couple of years.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.700
 Mine is one of the most aggressive

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:12.280
 forms of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that they've pretty much ever seen.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.300
 A company like that has money. They can fight a long time.

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.609
 Like I said, this fight might go past my life.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.320
 Lee Johnson sued Monsanto – and won.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.900
 The jury awarded him $289 million in August of 2018

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.280
 after concluding his cancer was linked to exposure to Roundup,

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.180
 Monsanto’s controversial toxic weed killer.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.380
 That's when I had the shower of Ranger Pro all over me.

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.220
 It went down in my protective gear. It went down in my suit — everywhere.

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:44.980
 Johnson was working as a groundskeeper at a few different schools for about four years,

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.480
 and using a concentrated version of Roundup called "Ranger Pro."

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.180
 While most past cases against the chemical giant haven’t gone anywhere,

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:57.500
 Johnson's has, and could open the door for thousands of others who say they're sick because of Monsanto.

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.700
 I was even told, "Lee, you don't want to try to go against that company."

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.280
 And I had no choice, because I had no job. I was sick. So I had to do what I needed to do.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.920
 “It goes through the plant to kill it. Tops and rhizomes.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.600
 The more complete control of Roundup lasts longer than one year.”

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.700
 – ”But is it worth it?”

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.660
 Monsanto’s flagship product, Roundup, has been the center of a heated debate for years.

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.629
 It's the most widely used weed killer in the world.

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.822
 19 billion pounds of it have already been used since its release in the '70s.

00:01:34.822 --> 00:01:36.200
 It's on the food we eat,

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.560
 it’s sprayed on playgrounds, at dog parks – it’s everywhere.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.660
 Its key ingredient, glyphosate, was classified as a probable carcinogen

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.640
 by the World Health Organization in 2015.

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:53.320
 Since then, Monsanto, now owned by Bayer, and its advocates have made it a mission

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.940
 to convince people in the government that their product is safe.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.320
 “You can drink a whole quart of it and it won’t hurt you.”

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.380
 – You want to drink some? We have some here.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.600
 – I’d be happy to, actually. Not really, but I know it wouldn’t hurt me.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.180
 – If you say so, I have some glyphosate. – No, no. I'm not stupid.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.360
 The use of Roundup skyrocketed in the mid-'90s,

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.560
 when Monsanto created genetically modified crops that can resist the chemical.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.360
 This led to farming practices like spraying Roundup

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.880
 across whole fields, and as a result on the food that people eat.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.030
 Glyphosate isn’t regulated by the USDA or the EPA.

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.460
 The FDA only recently started testing foods for it,

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.980
 after prompting from consumer groups and the Government Accountability Office.

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.569
 And so once they gave you the diagnosis, what was your reaction?

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.870
 That was the worst, you know, to hear that. That was the worst.

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:51.800
 They didn't want to see the type of cancer they saw in the test, so they did another test.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.300
 And this time, my wife went and they did ... That test was pretty bad,

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.720
 because she broke down and started crying and all that.

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.700
 And they found out that I had cancer. That I had non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.100
 I have some painful lesions right now.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:08.290
 I have some stuff going on. But I've been doing this for so long that I'm starting to get used to the pain.

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.860
 What were your kids' reactions when you first told them?

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.620
 Breaking the news to them was really hard,

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.960
 because you don't really ... as soon as you say "cancer," it's … people just count you out.

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.820
 They picture you laid out.

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.540
 They see me every day, so they see what I go through.

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:30.020
 So they were told, but then they see it. They've seen the way bottom, where I've been at.

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.960
 We’re headed to Benicia, California, the place I used to work.

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:40.600
 That’s when I got a super-big exposure, because the holes broke on my equipment.

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.120
 That’s when I had the shower of Ranger Pro all over me.

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:47.798
 It went down in my protective gear. It went down in my suit, everywhere.

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:53.049
 They don't use Roundup in the whole town anymore. They don't use it at all.

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.660
 They stopped using the formula at all, but I don't know what other chemicals they use.

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.360
 But they definitely stopped using that.

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.800
 – And that’s since your case?

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:06.520
 Yes, in this town and in another town about an hour from here called Novato, [California].

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.220
 Novato also quit using the formulation.

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:12.640
 Glyphosate is banned by cities and counties across the country.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:19.720
 France, Germany and a handful of other countries have also announced plans to phase it out or restrict it.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.440
 I'm glad that we made it past the threshold of where we can actually get more testing,

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:30.880
 and the conversation is obviously brewing about what's going on with our food, with our soil and everything.

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:35.500
 So it's a big deal, it's way bigger than me, so I'm just a part of the situation now.

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:41.889
 Johnson hopes his case will bring awareness to the dangers of using Roundup near schools.

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:45.980
 What we're pushing for is glyphosate-free campuses.

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:52.240
 That's my push. My goal is to have a pesticide-free campuses for all schools.

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.120
 People who are talking about this, the wave of attention it’s gotten,

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.830
 people are just like tentacles of me.

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:02.030
 I don’t have to say much or do much, because there’s so many people doing it before me,

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.320
 and then doing it now, and will probably be doing it after me.

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:09.080
 To keep grounds and keep farms and keep food safe.

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:13.560
 A few months after the ruling, the judge overturned the jury’s award,

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:15.760
 reducing it to $78 million.

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:17.840
 Johnson agreed to the new amount,

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:22.129
 but still hasn’t received any money yet to help pay for his cancer treatments.

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:26.449
 It's almost dealing with ghost money and dealing with the attention at the same time.

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:32.270
 That was a lot of time and it was hard going there, and to focus on trying to do that again,

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:36.480
 even though it's worth a quarter billion dollars, it's not really worth it.

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:37.730
 Because it was never about the money for me,

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:43.400
 so I think that the courts have done their fair justice.

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:50.640
 Right now, after me accepting the offer that was given, it’s up to the other side

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:52.540
 to decide whether or not we go back to court.

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:55.440
 They’ve already said publicly, over and over, they’re going to appeal,

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:59.580
 so we’re expecting a year or two of appeals, maybe more.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.240
 That’s why I’m saying this this could outdo me.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.240
 Monsanto representatives declined to sit down for an interview with us, but said they would be appealing.

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:12.100
 There are currently over 8,000 outstanding lawsuits against Monsanto.

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:17.000
 Lee’s case could set a legal precedent that could affect the outcome of others

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.660
 who wish to hold the company accountable.

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:21.740
 I hope that it's an inspiration to people that would think

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:25.440
 that if they had somebody or a company or something that wronged them.

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:27.920
 If you go up against something bigger than you,

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:30.220
 you either can get crushed or you can win,

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:34.040
 so I would say yeah, use my story as an example that you actually could win.
