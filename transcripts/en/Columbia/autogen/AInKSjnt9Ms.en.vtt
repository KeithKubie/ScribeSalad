million people are affected but the

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:53.609
million people are affected but the
 

00:02:53.609 --> 00:03:00.289
million people are affected but the
thing is is that by 2025 there will be

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299
thing is is that by 2025 there will be
 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:03.649

three million people worldwide with
 

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:07.460
three million people worldwide with
diabetes that's a lot of people and and

diabetes that's a lot of people and and
 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.559
diabetes that's a lot of people and and
if we we look at that and understand

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569
if we we look at that and understand
 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:11.539
if we we look at that and understand
that what we're looking at is is that

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549
that what we're looking at is is that
 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:14.420
that what we're looking at is is that
that's our children and I bring the

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430
that's our children and I bring the
 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.890
that's our children and I bring the
children and maybe even they sure

so so diabetes is really going to be

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:22.379
so so diabetes is really going to be
 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:24.949
so so diabetes is really going to be
devastating during that point the other

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959
devastating during that point the other
 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.520
devastating during that point the other
that the other thing is is that when we

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530
that the other thing is is that when we
 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.890
that the other thing is is that when we
look at type 2 diabetes as its previous

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900

00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:50.700
that has a graphic chart and all of that
 

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:53.060
that has a graphic chart and all of that
because the thing is is to get them to

00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:53.070
because the thing is is to get them to
 

00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:54.980
because the thing is is to get them to
be responsible to take back their own

00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:54.990
be responsible to take back their own
 

00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:58.640
be responsible to take back their own
health and so we gave them that the

00:09:58.640 --> 00:09:58.650
health and so we gave them that the
 

00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:02.560
health and so we gave them that the
monthly the chart I was talking about

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:02.570
monthly the chart I was talking about
 

00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:09.020
monthly the chart I was talking about
and this is the program we met for 12

00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:09.030
and this is the program we met for 12
 

00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:12.830
and this is the program we met for 12
weeks for two hours once a week we

00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:12.840
weeks for two hours once a week we
 

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:15.200
weeks for two hours once a week we
weighed people we took their blood

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:15.210
weighed people we took their blood
 

00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:18.770
weighed people we took their blood
pressure we then went into physical

00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:18.780
pressure we then went into physical
 

00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:22.760
pressure we then went into physical
activity we did that for 30 minutes we

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:22.770
activity we did that for 30 minutes we
 

00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:26.750
activity we did that for 30 minutes we
went into the progressive relaxation we

00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:26.760
went into the progressive relaxation we
 

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:28.910
went into the progressive relaxation we
then had a healthy lecture we had a

00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:28.920
then had a healthy lecture we had a
 

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:32.330
then had a healthy lecture we had a
healthy meal and we followed up with

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:32.340
healthy meal and we followed up with
 

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:35.380
healthy meal and we followed up with
them on three and six-month basis and

00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:35.390
them on three and six-month basis and
 

00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:37.940
them on three and six-month basis and
the interesting thing was that we had

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:37.950
the interesting thing was that we had
 

00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:41.180
the interesting thing was that we had
children there we had children from

00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:41.190
children there we had children from
 

00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:43.400
children there we had children from
actually the age of three years old - I

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:43.410
actually the age of three years old - I
 

00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:46.100
actually the age of three years old - I
think that oldest was about 12 years old

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:46.110
think that oldest was about 12 years old
 

00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:48.440
think that oldest was about 12 years old
and the children asked some very

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:48.450
and the children asked some very
 

00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:52.790
and the children asked some very
interesting questions that that actually

00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:52.800
interesting questions that that actually
 

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:54.980
interesting questions that that actually
made their personal get them acidic now

00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:54.990
made their personal get them acidic now
 

00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:57.560
made their personal get them acidic now
we do get that from because of the fact

00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:57.570
we do get that from because of the fact
 

00:10:57.570 --> 00:10:59.660
we do get that from because of the fact
that the children you know a children to

00:10:59.660 --> 00:10:59.670
that the children you know a children to
 

00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:03.050
that the children you know a children to
ask four questions in 10 adults I mean

00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:03.060
ask four questions in 10 adults I mean
 

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:04.930
ask four questions in 10 adults I mean
and they asked all kinds of questions

00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:04.940
and they asked all kinds of questions
 

00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:09.800
and they asked all kinds of questions
but in the process of doing that like I

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:09.810
but in the process of doing that like I
 

00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:14.260
but in the process of doing that like I
said we began to to increase the people

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:14.270
said we began to to increase the people
 

00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:19.740
said we began to to increase the people
this was a baseline I based I was a

00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:19.750
this was a baseline I based I was a
 

00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:22.060
this was a baseline I based I was a
seven-year over seven years

00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:22.070
seven-year over seven years
 

00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:26.380
seven-year over seven years
we saw 1009 actually was 1200 after we

00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:26.390
we saw 1009 actually was 1200 after we
 

00:11:26.390 --> 00:11:29.290
we saw 1009 actually was 1200 after we
wouldn't recalculated some things and

00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:29.300
wouldn't recalculated some things and
 

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:32.710
wouldn't recalculated some things and
they were from age 20 to 65 but they had

00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:32.720
they were from age 20 to 65 but they had
 

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:35.530

their children whatever we we helped the
 

00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:37.449
their children whatever we we helped the
program four times again in other words

00:11:37.449 --> 00:11:37.459
program four times again in other words
 

00:11:37.459 --> 00:11:40.329
program four times again in other words
we moved the program program around the

00:11:40.329 --> 00:11:40.339
we moved the program program around the
 

00:11:40.339 --> 00:11:44.320
we moved the program program around the
community we moved the program every 12

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:44.330
community we moved the program every 12
 

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:46.000
community we moved the program every 12
weeks every three months we were in a

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:46.010
weeks every three months we were in a
 

00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:48.510
weeks every three months we were in a
different location with the program and

00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:48.520
different location with the program and
 

00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:51.460
different location with the program and
and the interesting thing was that

00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:51.470
and the interesting thing was that
 

00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:53.800
and the interesting thing was that
people from the previous program would

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:53.810
people from the previous program would
 

00:11:53.810 --> 00:11:55.960
people from the previous program would
come to the program to the new program

00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:55.970
come to the program to the new program
 

00:11:55.970 --> 00:11:58.960
come to the program to the new program
and as they came to the new program they

00:11:58.960 --> 00:11:58.970
and as they came to the new program they
 

00:11:58.970 --> 00:12:01.090
and as they came to the new program they
would then begin to volunteer to assist

00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:01.100
would then begin to volunteer to assist
 

00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:05.199
would then begin to volunteer to assist
us in doing the program participants

00:12:05.199 --> 00:12:05.209
us in doing the program participants
 

00:12:05.209 --> 00:12:07.060
us in doing the program participants
were insulin dependent most of them were

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:07.070
were insulin dependent most of them were
 

00:12:07.070 --> 00:12:09.550
were insulin dependent most of them were
type 2 we did have a few that were type

00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:09.560

diabetes matter of fact when I was in
 

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:15.889
diabetes matter of fact when I was in
Cuba we did a thing where where we use

00:13:15.889 --> 00:13:15.899
Cuba we did a thing where where we use
 

00:13:15.899 --> 00:13:17.900

and we use it in Cuba for diabetics and
 

00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:27.280
and we use it in Cuba for diabetics and
we found it to actually really assist in

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:27.290
we found it to actually really assist in
 

00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:30.970
we found it to actually really assist in
lowering blood sugar levels then

00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:30.980
lowering blood sugar levels then
 

00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:33.440
lowering blood sugar levels then
physical movement and some of the

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:33.450
physical movement and some of the
 

00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:35.900
physical movement and some of the
physical movement was just yet just bad

00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:35.910
physical movement was just yet just bad
 

00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:39.110
physical movement was just yet just bad
physical movement we do all kinds of

00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:39.120
physical movement we do all kinds of
 

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:40.940
physical movement we do all kinds of
things we had a good time and then

00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:40.950
things we had a good time and then
 

00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:43.070
things we had a good time and then
rhythmatic breathing to get to breathing

00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:43.080
rhythmatic breathing to get to breathing
 

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:45.079
rhythmatic breathing to get to breathing
because when you when you hit them when

00:13:45.079 --> 00:13:45.089
because when you when you hit them when
 

00:13:45.089 --> 00:13:47.300
because when you when you hit them when
you get the oxygenate the blood the

00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:47.310
you get the oxygenate the blood the
 

00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:50.000
you get the oxygenate the blood the
blood then begins to change from a city

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:50.010
blood then begins to change from a city
 

00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:54.650
blood then begins to change from a city
to alkaline and so as we oxygenated the

00:13:54.650 --> 00:13:54.660
to alkaline and so as we oxygenated the
 

00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:57.070
to alkaline and so as we oxygenated the
blood we gotta cut to become more

00:13:57.070 --> 00:13:57.080
blood we gotta cut to become more
 

00:13:57.080 --> 00:14:00.079
blood we gotta cut to become more
alkaline and it also help bring down the

00:14:00.079 --> 00:14:00.089
alkaline and it also help bring down the
 

00:14:00.089 --> 00:14:04.220
alkaline and it also help bring down the
blood sugar level the progressive

00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:04.230
blood sugar level the progressive
 

00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:06.560
blood sugar level the progressive
relaxation we've got into meditation for

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:06.570

having them to to really begin to to we
we had charts showing showing the bhana

00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:17.820
we had charts showing showing the bhana
 

00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:21.860
we had charts showing showing the bhana
and we showed the pancreas so we had to

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:21.870
and we showed the pancreas so we had to
 

00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:24.019
and we showed the pancreas so we had to
visualize the pancreas being

00:14:24.019 --> 00:14:24.029
visualize the pancreas being
 

00:14:24.029 --> 00:14:27.170
visualize the pancreas being
restructured and having the cells to

00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:27.180
restructured and having the cells to
 

00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:31.280
restructured and having the cells to
begin to function properly we did again

00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:31.290
begin to function properly we did again
 

00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:36.590

things that that we don't realize this
 

00:15:14.679 --> 00:15:17.009
things that that we don't realize this
is that each season our body changes our

00:15:17.009 --> 00:15:17.019
is that each season our body changes our
 

00:15:17.019 --> 00:15:18.780
is that each season our body changes our
digestive changes and so we have to

00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:18.790
digestive changes and so we have to
 

00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:21.030
digestive changes and so we have to
change some of the foods we eat so we

00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:21.040
change some of the foods we eat so we
 

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:24.079
change some of the foods we eat so we

person could be under that would cause
the food not to digest we talked about

00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:33.550
the food not to digest we talked about
 

00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:36.509

each other remember I just said that
 

00:16:48.279 --> 00:16:51.150
each other remember I just said that
it's about chemistry so so we got them

00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:51.160
it's about chemistry so so we got them
 

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:53.609
it's about chemistry so so we got them
into chemistry and it's and it's amazing

00:16:53.609 --> 00:16:53.619
into chemistry and it's and it's amazing
 

00:16:53.619 --> 00:16:56.669
into chemistry and it's and it's amazing
what what happened because people wanted

00:16:56.669 --> 00:16:56.679

wanted they wanted more information we
 

00:17:06.579 --> 00:17:09.419
wanted they wanted more information we
talked about digestion the preparation

00:17:09.419 --> 00:17:09.429
talked about digestion the preparation
 

00:17:09.429 --> 00:17:12.990
talked about digestion the preparation
of foods income in combination

00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:13.000
of foods income in combination
 

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.970
of foods income in combination
for instance we talked about the factor

00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:14.980
for instance we talked about the factor
 

00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:17.819
for instance we talked about the factor
of of not in proteins and starches at

00:17:17.819 --> 00:17:17.829
of of not in proteins and starches at
 

00:17:17.829 --> 00:17:19.769

the same time you can eat them at the

00:17:19.769 --> 00:17:19.779
the same time you can eat them at the
 

00:17:19.779 --> 00:17:21.329
the same time you can eat them at the
same meal but don't put them in their

00:17:21.329 --> 00:17:21.339
same meal but don't put them in their
 

00:17:21.339 --> 00:17:23.519
same meal but don't put them in their
mouth at the same time because if I was

00:17:23.519 --> 00:17:23.529
mouth at the same time because if I was
 

00:17:23.529 --> 00:17:24.870
mouth at the same time because if I was
looking for that starts to break down

and the stomach is looking for that
 

00:17:26.679 --> 00:17:30.750
and the stomach is looking for that
protein and when you get it all mr. Bob

00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:30.760
protein and when you get it all mr. Bob
 

00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:32.669
protein and when you get it all mr. Bob
you lady like that what happens is the

00:17:32.669 --> 00:17:32.679
you lady like that what happens is the
 

00:17:32.679 --> 00:17:34.560

and they send it down into the small

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:36.610
and they send it down into the small
 

00:17:36.610 --> 00:17:38.370
and they send it down into the small
intestines and the small intestines will

00:17:38.370 --> 00:17:38.380
intestines and the small intestines will
 

00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:40.379
intestines and the small intestines will
say well take this number they go sit in

00:17:40.379 --> 00:17:40.389
say well take this number they go sit in
 

00:17:40.389 --> 00:17:42.210
say well take this number they go sit in
the corner and I'll call you and then

00:17:42.210 --> 00:17:42.220
the corner and I'll call you and then
 

00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:44.519
the corner and I'll call you and then
you have that fermentation and a future

00:17:44.519 --> 00:17:44.529
you have that fermentation and a future
 

00:17:44.529 --> 00:17:47.010
you have that fermentation and a future
vacation and that methane that starts to

00:17:47.010 --> 00:17:47.020
vacation and that methane that starts to
 

00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:49.500
vacation and that methane that starts to
happen in with that sulfate sulfur and

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:49.510
happen in with that sulfate sulfur and
 

00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:51.720
happen in with that sulfate sulfur and
then when it comes out you can't stand

00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:51.730

00:18:35.039 --> 00:18:37.100
a state at the same time you see them
you see you see the gorillas pick up a

00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:37.110
you see you see the gorillas pick up a
 

00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:37.639
you see you see the gorillas pick up a
banana

00:18:37.639 --> 00:18:37.649
banana
 

00:18:37.649 --> 00:18:39.740
banana
he'd the banana wait a few minutes then

00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:39.750
he'd the banana wait a few minutes then
 

00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:41.360
he'd the banana wait a few minutes then
pick up some leaves you need it but he

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:41.370
pick up some leaves you need it but he
 

00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:43.430
pick up some leaves you need it but he
but the gorilla doesn't do that but

00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:43.440
but the gorilla doesn't do that but
 

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:45.619
but the gorilla doesn't do that but
humans do that we like you said you need

00:18:45.619 --> 00:18:45.629
humans do that we like you said you need
 

00:18:45.629 --> 00:18:50.240
humans do that we like you said you need
everything you know and being in Chinese

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:50.250
everything you know and being in Chinese
 

00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:52.610
everything you know and being in Chinese
medicine you know in the Asian culture

00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:52.620
medicine you know in the Asian culture
 

00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:56.060
medicine you know in the Asian culture
everything it has a purpose you know I

00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:56.070
everything it has a purpose you know I
 

00:18:56.070 --> 00:19:00.649
everything it has a purpose you know I
mean everything has a purpose let's see

00:19:00.649 --> 00:19:00.659
mean everything has a purpose let's see
 

00:19:00.659 --> 00:19:04.940
mean everything has a purpose let's see
where we are okay so this is you have

00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:04.950
where we are okay so this is you have
 

00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:06.950
where we are okay so this is you have
this in your handout so I really don't

00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:06.960
this in your handout so I really don't
 

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:09.590
this in your handout so I really don't
want to go through that but enzymes you

00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:09.600
want to go through that but enzymes you
 

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:11.930
want to go through that but enzymes you
know we taught them about enzyme and we

00:19:11.930 --> 00:19:11.940
know we taught them about enzyme and we
 

00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:14.720
know we taught them about enzyme and we
taught them about the factor that that

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:14.730
taught them about the factor that that
 

00:19:14.730 --> 00:19:19.490
taught them about the factor that that
enzymes died at 118 degrees Fahrenheit

00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:19.500
enzymes died at 118 degrees Fahrenheit
 

00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:23.119
enzymes died at 118 degrees Fahrenheit
so that means that we normally cook

00:19:23.119 --> 00:19:23.129
so that means that we normally cook
 

00:19:23.129 --> 00:19:26.330
so that means that we normally cook
stuff at 250 degrees the manufacturers

00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:26.340
stuff at 250 degrees the manufacturers
 

00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:28.549
stuff at 250 degrees the manufacturers
cook the stuff at five to seven thousand

00:19:28.549 --> 00:19:28.559
cook the stuff at five to seven thousand
 

00:19:28.559 --> 00:19:29.960
cook the stuff at five to seven thousand
degrees because they want to make sure

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:29.970
degrees because they want to make sure
 

00:19:29.970 --> 00:19:32.180
degrees because they want to make sure
that there's no there's no bacteria and

00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:32.190
that there's no there's no bacteria and
 

00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:34.159
that there's no there's no bacteria and
so by the time it gets to the plate is

00:19:34.159 --> 00:19:34.169
so by the time it gets to the plate is
 

00:19:34.169 --> 00:19:37.039
so by the time it gets to the plate is
dead so we taught them how to how to

00:19:37.039 --> 00:19:37.049
dead so we taught them how to how to
 

00:19:37.049 --> 00:19:39.139
dead so we taught them how to how to
cook foods to make sure that the fruits

00:19:39.139 --> 00:19:39.149
cook foods to make sure that the fruits
 

00:19:39.149 --> 00:19:41.650
cook foods to make sure that the fruits
have enzymes we taught them how to

00:19:41.650 --> 00:19:41.660
have enzymes we taught them how to
 

00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:44.770
have enzymes we taught them how to
go about eating raw foods matter of fact

00:19:44.770 --> 00:19:44.780
go about eating raw foods matter of fact
 

00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:46.180
go about eating raw foods matter of fact
there were some children in the program

00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:46.190
there were some children in the program
 

00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:47.920
there were some children in the program
that would never eat vegetables by the

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:47.930
that would never eat vegetables by the
 

00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:49.660
that would never eat vegetables by the
end of the program they were eating

00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:49.670
end of the program they were eating
 

00:19:49.670 --> 00:19:53.680
end of the program they were eating
vegetables we we taught them about about

00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:53.690
vegetables we we taught them about about
 

00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:56.770
vegetables we we taught them about about
the factor of when they feel their body

00:19:56.770 --> 00:19:56.780
the factor of when they feel their body
 

00:19:56.780 --> 00:19:59.140
the factor of when they feel their body
full of enzymes the body would get well

00:19:59.140 --> 00:19:59.150
full of enzymes the body would get well
 

00:19:59.150 --> 00:20:02.110
full of enzymes the body would get well
and when they deplete their body of

00:20:02.110 --> 00:20:02.120
and when they deplete their body of
 

00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:04.750
and when they deplete their body of
enzymes the body don't we get to be sick

00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:04.760
enzymes the body don't we get to be sick
 

00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:06.820
enzymes the body don't we get to be sick
and and they'll have problems and that

00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:06.830
and and they'll have problems and that
 

00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:10.000
and and they'll have problems and that
was part of the diabetes and so we had

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:10.010
was part of the diabetes and so we had
 

00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:13.060
was part of the diabetes and so we had
them to increase the enzymes we talked

00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:13.070
them to increase the enzymes we talked
 

00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:17.380
them to increase the enzymes we talked
about proteins we educated them very

00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:17.390
about proteins we educated them very
 

00:20:17.390 --> 00:20:20.500
about proteins we educated them very
well on on what proteins do and what

00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:20.510
well on on what proteins do and what
 

00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:23.560
well on on what proteins do and what
they don't do and why you need proteins

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:23.570
they don't do and why you need proteins
 

00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:25.450
they don't do and why you need proteins
of what kind of proteins that you do

00:20:25.450 --> 00:20:25.460
of what kind of proteins that you do
 

00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:28.630
of what kind of proteins that you do
need and which proteins are very more

00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:28.640
need and which proteins are very more
 

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:31.330
need and which proteins are very more
digestible and which proteins aren't and

00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:31.340
digestible and which proteins aren't and
 

00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:33.600
digestible and which proteins aren't and
we talked about the factor of

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:33.610
we talked about the factor of
 

00:20:33.610 --> 00:20:35.980
we talked about the factor of
lactose-intolerant because you know we

00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:35.990
lactose-intolerant because you know we
 

00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:38.020
lactose-intolerant because you know we
we know that ninety seven percent of

00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:38.030
we know that ninety seven percent of
 

00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:40.540
we know that ninety seven percent of
people of color a lactose intolerant and

00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:40.550
people of color a lactose intolerant and
 

00:20:40.550 --> 00:20:42.850
people of color a lactose intolerant and
so when you put something in that your

00:20:42.850 --> 00:20:42.860
so when you put something in that your
 

00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:44.530
so when you put something in that your
body doesn't tolerate what does your

00:20:44.530 --> 00:20:44.540
body doesn't tolerate what does your
 

00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:46.900
body doesn't tolerate what does your
body do with it and it'll wind up

00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:46.910
body do with it and it'll wind up
 

00:20:46.910 --> 00:20:49.630
body do with it and it'll wind up
sitting in your colon and so then once

00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:49.640
sitting in your colon and so then once
 

00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:51.580
sitting in your colon and so then once
it sits in your colon for a while you

00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:51.590
it sits in your colon for a while you
 

00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:52.960
it sits in your colon for a while you
might have having what is called the

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:52.970
might have having what is called the
 

00:20:52.970 --> 00:20:55.000
might have having what is called the
leaky gut syndrome and the leaky gut

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:55.010
leaky gut syndrome and the leaky gut
 

00:20:55.010 --> 00:20:57.760
leaky gut syndrome and the leaky gut
syndrome there will lead to cholesterol

00:20:57.760 --> 00:20:57.770
syndrome there will lead to cholesterol
 

00:20:57.770 --> 00:21:00.040
syndrome there will lead to cholesterol
and high blood pressure and diabetes and

00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:00.050
and high blood pressure and diabetes and
 

00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:02.980
and high blood pressure and diabetes and
and a host of things and and I often say

00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:02.990
and a host of things and and I often say
 

00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:07.030
and a host of things and and I often say
that that there are no fat people in the

00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:07.040
that that there are no fat people in the
 

00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:09.760
that that there are no fat people in the
world and people look at me and say well

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:09.770
world and people look at me and say well
 

00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:11.800
world and people look at me and say well
you've never been fat in your life and

00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:11.810
you've never been fat in your life and
 

00:21:11.810 --> 00:21:12.430
you've never been fat in your life and
that's the truth

00:21:12.430 --> 00:21:12.440
that's the truth
 

00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:14.350
that's the truth
but there's not just a lot of people

00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:14.360
but there's not just a lot of people
 

00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:15.940
but there's not just a lot of people
that's full of waste because of the

00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:15.950
that's full of waste because of the
 

00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:17.140
that's full of waste because of the
factor that they're suffering from

00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:17.150
factor that they're suffering from
 

00:21:17.150 --> 00:21:19.600
factor that they're suffering from
malnutrition because of malabsorption

00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:19.610
malnutrition because of malabsorption
 

00:21:19.610 --> 00:21:22.840
malnutrition because of malabsorption
and and a malice simulation of the

00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:22.850
and and a malice simulation of the
 

00:21:22.850 --> 00:21:24.490
and and a malice simulation of the
nutrients from the foods that they eat

00:21:24.490 --> 00:21:24.500
nutrients from the foods that they eat
 

00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:29.500
nutrients from the foods that they eat
and then we talked about carbs and we

00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:29.510
and then we talked about carbs and we
 

00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:33.550
and then we talked about carbs and we
talked about how to eat carbs and we did

00:21:33.550 --> 00:21:33.560
talked about how to eat carbs and we did
 

00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:36.290
talked about how to eat carbs and we did
that through several different methods

00:21:36.290 --> 00:21:36.300
that through several different methods
 

00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:38.540
that through several different methods
we talked about showing people how to

00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:38.550
we talked about showing people how to
 

00:21:38.550 --> 00:21:41.720
we talked about showing people how to
use the glycemic index and then showing

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:41.730
use the glycemic index and then showing
 

00:21:41.730 --> 00:21:46.100
use the glycemic index and then showing
people how to eat carbs that were not

00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:46.110
people how to eat carbs that were not
 

00:21:46.110 --> 00:21:49.010
people how to eat carbs that were not
refined and which parts to eat and then

00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:49.020
refined and which parts to eat and then
 

00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:51.080
refined and which parts to eat and then
which parts to eat in the summer and the

00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:51.090
which parts to eat in the summer and the
 

00:21:51.090 --> 00:21:53.260
which parts to eat in the summer and the
winter time for instance rice brown rice

00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:53.270
winter time for instance rice brown rice
 

00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:55.700
winter time for instance rice brown rice
well most people be just the same rice

00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:55.710
well most people be just the same rice
 

00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:58.400
well most people be just the same rice
all year long well the truth of the

00:21:58.400 --> 00:21:58.410
all year long well the truth of the
 

00:21:58.410 --> 00:22:00.290
all year long well the truth of the
matter is is that in a winter time you

00:22:00.290 --> 00:22:00.300
matter is is that in a winter time you
 

00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:03.110
matter is is that in a winter time you
should be shot grain brown rice because

00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:03.120
should be shot grain brown rice because
 

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:04.910
should be shot grain brown rice because
it has more heat and it works more

00:22:04.910 --> 00:22:04.920
it has more heat and it works more
 

00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:07.280
it has more heat and it works more
effective and in the summer time you

00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:07.290
effective and in the summer time you
 

00:22:07.290 --> 00:22:10.430
effective and in the summer time you
should be eating long grain rice because

00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:10.440
should be eating long grain rice because
 

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:13.310
should be eating long grain rice because
in the summer time you don't need as

00:22:13.310 --> 00:22:13.320
in the summer time you don't need as
 

00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:16.460
in the summer time you don't need as
much as much heat and it's easy of that

00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:16.470
much as much heat and it's easy of that
 

00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:19.010
much as much heat and it's easy of that
to digest so we did that we talked about

00:22:19.010 --> 00:22:19.020
to digest so we did that we talked about
 

00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:22.930
to digest so we did that we talked about
how to how to keep things like tabbouleh

00:22:22.930 --> 00:22:22.940
how to how to keep things like tabbouleh
 

00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:26.570
how to how to keep things like tabbouleh
those kinds of things which are also

00:22:26.570 --> 00:22:26.580
those kinds of things which are also
 

00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:29.870
those kinds of things which are also
parts of grades and parsley and the

00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:29.880
parts of grades and parsley and the
 

00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:32.410
parts of grades and parsley and the
parsley were helped to help to actually

00:22:32.410 --> 00:22:32.420
parsley were helped to help to actually

okay and then we talked about calories

00:22:41.630 --> 00:22:41.640
okay and then we talked about calories
 

00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:44.420
okay and then we talked about calories
and and and we really showed them how to

00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:44.430
and and and we really showed them how to
 

00:22:44.430 --> 00:22:48.560
and and and we really showed them how to
identify calories and why was important

00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:48.570
identify calories and why was important
 

00:22:48.570 --> 00:22:50.540
identify calories and why was important
to burn certain calories and why not to

00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:50.550
to burn certain calories and why not to
 

00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:53.030
to burn certain calories and why not to
eat other calories and the deal with the

00:22:53.030 --> 00:22:53.040
eat other calories and the deal with the
 

00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:55.880
eat other calories and the deal with the
fact that things like sugar sugar were

00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:55.890
fact that things like sugar sugar were
 

00:22:55.890 --> 00:22:58.040
fact that things like sugar sugar were
empty calories especially when you have

00:22:58.040 --> 00:22:58.050
empty calories especially when you have
 

00:22:58.050 --> 00:23:00.620
empty calories especially when you have
refined that Domino's sugar that stuff

00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:00.630
refined that Domino's sugar that stuff
 

00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:03.860
refined that Domino's sugar that stuff
was was was definitely poison and you

00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:03.870
was was was definitely poison and you
 

00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:05.840
was was was definitely poison and you
know it's really interesting about sugar

00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:05.850
know it's really interesting about sugar
 

00:23:05.850 --> 00:23:09.590

neuropathy those kinds of things so so

00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:37.750
neuropathy those kinds of things so so

so we talked about you know carpets that

00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:40.120
so we talked about you know carpets that
 

00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:43.760

they should eat and they should eat and

they should eat and they should eat and
the glycemic index as I had said we we

00:23:47.310 --> 00:23:47.320
the glycemic index as I had said we we
 

00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:49.230
the glycemic index as I had said we we
taught them about that we talked about

00:23:49.230 --> 00:23:49.240
taught them about that we talked about
 

00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:51.990
taught them about that we talked about
fatty acids because most people when you

00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:52.000
fatty acids because most people when you
 

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.140
fatty acids because most people when you
say fat they don't they don't realize

00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:55.150
say fat they don't they don't realize
 

00:23:55.150 --> 00:23:59.160
say fat they don't they don't realize
that fat is fatty acids and you have you

00:23:59.160 --> 00:23:59.170
that fat is fatty acids and you have you
 

00:23:59.170 --> 00:24:01.410
that fat is fatty acids and you have you
have two kinds of fatty acids you have

00:24:01.410 --> 00:24:01.420
have two kinds of fatty acids you have
 

00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:04.170
have two kinds of fatty acids you have
that that you shouldn't eat wood is

00:24:04.170 --> 00:24:04.180
that that you shouldn't eat wood is
 

00:24:04.180 --> 00:24:06.270
that that you shouldn't eat wood is
saturated fat then you have the probably

00:24:06.270 --> 00:24:06.280
saturated fat then you have the probably
 

00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:09.060
saturated fat then you have the probably
unsaturated fatty acids that are that

00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:09.070
unsaturated fatty acids that are that
 

00:24:09.070 --> 00:24:11.010
unsaturated fatty acids that are that
you shoot that you should be eating but

00:24:11.010 --> 00:24:11.020
you shoot that you should be eating but
 

00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:14.340
you shoot that you should be eating but
we also gave them a LA's which is a

00:24:14.340 --> 00:24:14.350
we also gave them a LA's which is a
 

00:24:14.350 --> 00:24:18.270
we also gave them a LA's which is a
lipoic acid we talked about omega-3

00:24:18.270 --> 00:24:18.280
lipoic acid we talked about omega-3
 

00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:22.110
lipoic acid we talked about omega-3
omega-6 omega-9 and how they worked in

00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:22.120
omega-6 omega-9 and how they worked in
 

00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:24.810
omega-6 omega-9 and how they worked in
the body of how the body needs those for

00:24:24.810 --> 00:24:24.820
the body of how the body needs those for
 

00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:27.140
the body of how the body needs those for
not only lubrication but for hormonal

00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:27.150
not only lubrication but for hormonal
 

00:24:27.150 --> 00:24:30.980
not only lubrication but for hormonal
that help the package to stimulate the

00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:30.990
that help the package to stimulate the
 

00:24:30.990 --> 00:24:34.320
that help the package to stimulate the
the instrument that kind of things so

00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:34.330
the instrument that kind of things so
 

00:24:34.330 --> 00:24:36.780
the instrument that kind of things so
weak so we got all been tube into the

00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:36.790
weak so we got all been tube into the
 

00:24:36.790 --> 00:24:39.870
weak so we got all been tube into the
biochemistry of the body and then we

00:24:39.870 --> 00:24:39.880
biochemistry of the body and then we
 

00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:43.680
biochemistry of the body and then we
talked about a food pyramid and and we

00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:43.690
talked about a food pyramid and and we
 

00:24:43.690 --> 00:24:47.160
talked about a food pyramid and and we
changed a couple of things we we changed

00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:47.170
changed a couple of things we we changed
 

00:24:47.170 --> 00:24:49.110
changed a couple of things we we changed
the food pyramid we had interchange the

00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:49.120
the food pyramid we had interchange the
 

00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:51.450
the food pyramid we had interchange the
food pyramid and then we had them

00:24:51.450 --> 00:24:51.460
food pyramid and then we had them
 

00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:53.580
food pyramid and then we had them
because they were african-americans we

00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:53.590
because they were african-americans we
 

00:24:53.590 --> 00:25:00.810
because they were african-americans we
had them to look at the I want to say

00:25:00.810 --> 00:25:00.820
had them to look at the I want to say
 

00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:04.110
had them to look at the I want to say
glycemic index but it's not the BMI

00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:04.120
glycemic index but it's not the BMI
 

00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:08.580
glycemic index but it's not the BMI
child and we had to change that because

00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:08.590
child and we had to change that because
 

00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:13.170
child and we had to change that because
we did my weight my height and it said

00:25:13.170 --> 00:25:13.180
we did my weight my height and it said
 

00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:15.420
we did my weight my height and it said
that if I gain five pounds I'd be

00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:15.430
that if I gain five pounds I'd be
 

00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:21.610
that if I gain five pounds I'd be
overweight and so you know I looked it

00:25:21.610 --> 00:25:21.620
 
 

00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:26.180
 
you know I mean and and so we we changed

00:25:26.180 --> 00:25:26.190
you know I mean and and so we we changed
 

00:25:26.190 --> 00:25:30.980
you know I mean and and so we we changed
that and we moved it like five and in

00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:30.990
that and we moved it like five and in
 

00:25:30.990 --> 00:25:33.980
that and we moved it like five and in
some cases ten pounds to see exactly how

00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:33.990
some cases ten pounds to see exactly how
 

00:25:33.990 --> 00:25:36.860
some cases ten pounds to see exactly how
that would come and and we did a thing

00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:36.870
that would come and and we did a thing
 

00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:38.650
that would come and and we did a thing
to to actually work with them

00:25:38.650 --> 00:25:38.660
to to actually work with them
 

00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:41.090
to to actually work with them
psychologically to get them to realize

00:25:41.090 --> 00:25:41.100
psychologically to get them to realize
 

00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:43.400
psychologically to get them to realize
that well okay so if you lost this

00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:43.410
that well okay so if you lost this
 

00:25:43.410 --> 00:25:47.029
that well okay so if you lost this
amount of weight that would put you

00:25:47.029 --> 00:25:47.039
amount of weight that would put you
 

00:25:47.039 --> 00:25:48.919
amount of weight that would put you
under this so then you wouldn't be

00:25:48.919 --> 00:25:48.929
under this so then you wouldn't be
 

00:25:48.929 --> 00:25:51.710
under this so then you wouldn't be
overweight and it worked I mean they

00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:51.720
overweight and it worked I mean they
 

00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:53.930
overweight and it worked I mean they
really they really got involved in it

00:25:53.930 --> 00:25:53.940
really they really got involved in it
 

00:25:53.940 --> 00:25:57.680
really they really got involved in it
and it began to work for them

00:25:57.680 --> 00:25:57.690
and it began to work for them
 

00:25:57.690 --> 00:26:01.940
and it began to work for them
and then as I talked about eating foods

00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:01.950
and then as I talked about eating foods
 

00:26:01.950 --> 00:26:04.310
and then as I talked about eating foods
in their proper seasons all of this all

00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:04.320
in their proper seasons all of this all
 

00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:05.690
in their proper seasons all of this all
of this information you have in the

00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:05.700
of this information you have in the
 

00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:11.930
of this information you have in the
handout okay let's see where we go okay

00:26:11.930 --> 00:26:11.940
handout okay let's see where we go okay
 

00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:15.680
handout okay let's see where we go okay
functional foods and in functional foods

00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:15.690
functional foods and in functional foods
 

00:26:15.690 --> 00:26:18.020
functional foods and in functional foods
we talked about foods that were that

00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:18.030
we talked about foods that were that
 

00:26:18.030 --> 00:26:20.539
we talked about foods that were that
were good for them to eat like nuts but

00:26:20.539 --> 00:26:20.549
were good for them to eat like nuts but
 

00:26:20.549 --> 00:26:23.029
were good for them to eat like nuts but
but ii think what nuts is is that nuts

00:26:23.029 --> 00:26:23.039
but ii think what nuts is is that nuts
 

00:26:23.039 --> 00:26:25.789
but ii think what nuts is is that nuts
it like being and so what next you have

00:26:25.789 --> 00:26:25.799
it like being and so what next you have
 

00:26:25.799 --> 00:26:28.970
it like being and so what next you have
to soak them and that's why that's the

00:26:28.970 --> 00:26:28.980
to soak them and that's why that's the
 

00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:31.450
to soak them and that's why that's the
day because I don't like soggy nuts and

00:26:31.450 --> 00:26:31.460
day because I don't like soggy nuts and
 

00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:34.640
day because I don't like soggy nuts and
you you soak the nuts and then you throw

00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:34.650
you you soak the nuts and then you throw
 

00:26:34.650 --> 00:26:37.279
you you soak the nuts and then you throw
the water on and you eat the soggy nuts

00:26:37.279 --> 00:26:37.289
the water on and you eat the soggy nuts
 

00:26:37.289 --> 00:26:39.560
the water on and you eat the soggy nuts
that's how you get the inhibitors but

00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:39.570
that's how you get the inhibitors but
 

00:26:39.570 --> 00:26:41.990
that's how you get the inhibitors but
I'm not even though sorry nuts forget

00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:42.000
I'm not even though sorry nuts forget
 

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:45.110
I'm not even though sorry nuts forget
about it I will not even else I mean in

00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:45.120
about it I will not even else I mean in
 

00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:47.659
about it I will not even else I mean in
Estes it you don't I'll find another way

00:26:58.270 --> 00:26:58.280
had them to visit there's a thing called
 

00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:01.810
had them to visit there's a thing called
open water and the recipe for all the

decreased in doctors toasts let several

00:36:05.109 --> 00:36:05.119
decreased in doctors toasts let several
 

00:36:05.119 --> 00:36:10.529
decreased in doctors toasts let several
of participants off of their medicine

00:36:10.529 --> 00:36:10.539
of participants off of their medicine

because their body began to stabilize

00:36:14.549 --> 00:36:14.559
because their body began to stabilize

because their body began to stabilize
let's see what else we got over here and

00:36:16.870 --> 00:36:16.880
let's see what else we got over here and
 

00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:36.489
let's see what else we got over here and
that's it right I would say 75% of them

00:36:36.489 --> 00:36:36.499
that's it right I would say 75% of them
 

00:36:36.499 --> 00:36:38.200
that's it right I would say 75% of them
maintaining because we didn't call it a

we call it an eating habit and they saw

00:36:41.289 --> 00:36:41.299
we call it an eating habit and they saw
 

00:36:41.299 --> 00:36:44.769
we call it an eating habit and they saw
the results of them and so when we win

00:36:44.769 --> 00:36:44.779
the results of them and so when we win
 

00:36:44.779 --> 00:36:48.339
the results of them and so when we win
it and check them few of them gave a

00:36:48.339 --> 00:36:48.349
it and check them few of them gave a
 

00:36:48.349 --> 00:36:50.230
it and check them few of them gave a
little bit of way back but they didn't

00:36:50.230 --> 00:36:50.240
little bit of way back but they didn't
 

00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:52.239
little bit of way back but they didn't
revert back to the eating that they were

00:36:52.239 --> 00:36:52.249
revert back to the eating that they were
 

00:36:52.249 --> 00:36:55.059
revert back to the eating that they were
doing so their blood sugar levels were

00:36:55.059 --> 00:36:55.069
doing so their blood sugar levels were
 

00:36:55.069 --> 00:36:57.999
doing so their blood sugar levels were
still down okay and their hypertension

00:36:57.999 --> 00:36:58.009
still down okay and their hypertension
 

00:36:58.009 --> 00:37:00.819
still down okay and their hypertension
was what was decreased as well as

00:37:00.819 --> 00:37:00.829
was what was decreased as well as
 

00:37:00.829 --> 00:37:02.650
was what was decreased as well as
cholesterol matter of fact we had a

00:37:02.650 --> 00:37:02.660
cholesterol matter of fact we had a
 

00:37:02.660 --> 00:37:05.799
cholesterol matter of fact we had a
couple of children who were seven and

00:37:05.799 --> 00:37:05.809
couple of children who were seven and
 

00:37:05.809 --> 00:37:07.690
couple of children who were seven and
eight years old and Nick cholesterol was

00:37:07.690 --> 00:37:07.700
eight years old and Nick cholesterol was
 

00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:11.470
eight years old and Nick cholesterol was
off the chain and after them and their

00:37:11.470 --> 00:37:11.480
off the chain and after them and their
 

00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:14.170
off the chain and after them and their
parents going through our program what

00:37:14.170 --> 00:37:14.180
parents going through our program what
 

00:37:14.180 --> 00:37:15.560
parents going through our program what
happened

00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:15.570
happened
 

00:37:15.570 --> 00:37:18.140
happened
the doctor was amazed at the way that

00:37:18.140 --> 00:37:18.150
the doctor was amazed at the way that
 

00:37:18.150 --> 00:37:41.240
the doctor was amazed at the way that
the cholesterol came in

00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:41.250
 
 

00:37:41.250 --> 00:37:46.350
 
well the program off the top of my head

00:37:46.350 --> 00:37:46.360
well the program off the top of my head
 

00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:49.260
well the program off the top of my head
I think I think for the year for all of

00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:49.270
I think I think for the year for all of
 

00:37:49.270 --> 00:37:56.030
I think I think for the year for all of
the community I think it was $35,000

00:37:56.030 --> 00:37:56.040
 
 

00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:59.190
 
that would be that deck might be seven

00:37:59.190 --> 00:37:59.200
that would be that deck might be seven
 

00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:02.970
that would be that deck might be seven
like maybe a thousand dollars maybe

00:38:02.970 --> 00:38:02.980
like maybe a thousand dollars maybe
 

00:38:02.980 --> 00:38:05.850
like maybe a thousand dollars maybe
maybe yeah you know I mean I'm not I'm

00:38:05.850 --> 00:38:05.860
maybe yeah you know I mean I'm not I'm
 

00:38:05.860 --> 00:38:08.400
maybe yeah you know I mean I'm not I'm
not good in that department either but

00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:08.410
not good in that department either but
 

00:38:08.410 --> 00:38:10.170
not good in that department either but
it's a clinical of good everything but

00:38:10.170 --> 00:38:10.180
it's a clinical of good everything but
 

00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:11.820
it's a clinical of good everything but
the number Department but I mean it's

00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:11.830
the number Department but I mean it's
 

00:38:11.830 --> 00:38:17.430
the number Department but I mean it's
it's it's an affordable program when the

00:38:17.430 --> 00:38:17.440
it's it's an affordable program when the
 

00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:19.770
it's it's an affordable program when the
community gets together because you're

00:38:19.770 --> 00:38:19.780
community gets together because you're
 

00:38:19.780 --> 00:38:23.730
community gets together because you're
talking about fixing food okay you're

00:38:23.730 --> 00:38:23.740
talking about fixing food okay you're
 

00:38:23.740 --> 00:38:25.500
talking about fixing food okay you're
talking about making from this we make

00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:25.510
talking about making from this we make
 

00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:28.050
talking about making from this we make
sure people have water then we had to

00:38:28.050 --> 00:38:28.060
sure people have water then we had to
 

00:38:28.060 --> 00:38:30.300
sure people have water then we had to
pay folks who work we had some

00:38:30.300 --> 00:38:30.310
pay folks who work we had some
 

00:38:30.310 --> 00:38:32.370
pay folks who work we had some
volunteers but we had to pay face where

00:38:32.370 --> 00:38:32.380
volunteers but we had to pay face where
 

00:38:32.380 --> 00:38:33.450
volunteers but we had to pay face where
the patient might come and do the

00:38:33.450 --> 00:38:33.460
the patient might come and do the
 

00:38:33.460 --> 00:38:36.150
the patient might come and do the
exercise actually and we pay one of my

00:38:36.150 --> 00:38:36.160
exercise actually and we pay one of my
 

00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:40.050
exercise actually and we pay one of my
students I did the lecture and then my

00:38:40.050 --> 00:38:40.060
students I did the lecture and then my
 

00:38:40.060 --> 00:38:42.620
students I did the lecture and then my
former wife she did the cooking okay and

00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:42.630
former wife she did the cooking okay and
 

00:38:42.630 --> 00:38:46.680
former wife she did the cooking okay and
so all of that entail the the amount

00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:46.690
so all of that entail the the amount
 

00:38:46.690 --> 00:38:49.620
so all of that entail the the amount
that it calls but you know then you're

00:38:49.620 --> 00:38:49.630
that it calls but you know then you're
 

00:38:49.630 --> 00:38:52.410
that it calls but you know then you're
talking about how many people we had and

00:38:52.410 --> 00:38:52.420
talking about how many people we had and
 

00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:55.110
talking about how many people we had and
at one point in one of the programs we

00:38:55.110 --> 00:38:55.120
at one point in one of the programs we
 

00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:58.830
at one point in one of the programs we
had 65 people so we were so we was

00:38:58.830 --> 00:38:58.840
had 65 people so we were so we was
 

00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:01.650
had 65 people so we were so we was
fixing food for 65 people we had it in a

00:39:01.650 --> 00:39:01.660
fixing food for 65 people we had it in a
 

00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:03.840
fixing food for 65 people we had it in a
church and that that church actually

00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:03.850
church and that that church actually
 

00:39:03.850 --> 00:39:06.690
church and that that church actually
added to church one was one was 54 and

00:39:06.690 --> 00:39:06.700
added to church one was one was 54 and
 

00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:10.110
added to church one was one was 54 and
the other one was 65 so it so does

00:39:10.110 --> 00:39:10.120
the other one was 65 so it so does
 

00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:13.800
the other one was 65 so it so does
depend on the amount of people that that

00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:13.810
depend on the amount of people that that
 

00:39:13.810 --> 00:39:14.630
depend on the amount of people that that
come to the

00:39:14.630 --> 00:39:14.640
come to the
 

00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:17.269
come to the
to the program now the thing is is that

00:39:17.269 --> 00:39:17.279
to the program now the thing is is that
 

00:39:17.279 --> 00:39:21.849
to the program now the thing is is that
that that program can be scaled down to

00:39:21.849 --> 00:39:21.859
that that program can be scaled down to
 

00:39:21.859 --> 00:39:27.140
that that program can be scaled down to
where you could cut it off stay 10 12 14

00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:27.150
where you could cut it off stay 10 12 14
 

00:39:27.150 --> 00:39:30.410
where you could cut it off stay 10 12 14
20 people that's the limit for this

00:39:30.410 --> 00:39:30.420
20 people that's the limit for this
 

00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:32.720
20 people that's the limit for this
particular program and then do and then

00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:32.730
particular program and then do and then
 

00:39:32.730 --> 00:39:52.509
particular program and then do and then
do them simultaneously

00:39:52.509 --> 00:39:52.519
 
 

00:39:52.519 --> 00:39:56.539
 
all right they will DC the program did

00:39:56.539 --> 00:39:56.549
all right they will DC the program did
 

00:39:56.549 --> 00:39:59.660
all right they will DC the program did
you find that at all with your clients I

00:39:59.660 --> 00:39:59.670
you find that at all with your clients I
 

00:39:59.670 --> 00:40:01.940
you find that at all with your clients I
didn't and the reason I didn't was

00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:01.950
didn't and the reason I didn't was
 

00:40:01.950 --> 00:40:05.450
didn't and the reason I didn't was
because we gave them enzymes we had we

00:40:05.450 --> 00:40:05.460
because we gave them enzymes we had we
 

00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:08.769
because we gave them enzymes we had we
had them take enzymes and probiotics

00:40:08.769 --> 00:40:08.779
had them take enzymes and probiotics
 

00:40:08.779 --> 00:40:11.359
had them take enzymes and probiotics
because one of the things that I found

00:40:11.359 --> 00:40:11.369
because one of the things that I found
 

00:40:11.369 --> 00:40:13.490
because one of the things that I found
in my study which is which is actually

00:40:13.490 --> 00:40:13.500
in my study which is which is actually
 

00:40:13.500 --> 00:40:15.980
in my study which is which is actually
in my pool that's coming out one of the

00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:15.990
in my pool that's coming out one of the
 

00:40:15.990 --> 00:40:18.819
in my pool that's coming out one of the
things that I found is is that

00:40:18.819 --> 00:40:18.829
things that I found is is that
 

00:40:18.829 --> 00:40:22.069
things that I found is is that
constipation is a big issue with

00:40:22.069 --> 00:40:22.079
constipation is a big issue with
 

00:40:22.079 --> 00:40:24.920
constipation is a big issue with
diabetes and especially with type 2

00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:24.930
diabetes and especially with type 2
 

00:40:24.930 --> 00:40:27.950
diabetes and especially with type 2
diabetics and so if we can get the gut

00:40:27.950 --> 00:40:27.960
diabetics and so if we can get the gut
 

00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:32.059
diabetics and so if we can get the gut
flora to begin to harmonize with the

00:40:32.059 --> 00:40:32.069
flora to begin to harmonize with the
 

00:40:32.069 --> 00:40:34.999
flora to begin to harmonize with the
bacterias what happens is is that not

00:40:34.999 --> 00:40:35.009
bacterias what happens is is that not
 

00:40:35.009 --> 00:40:37.999
bacterias what happens is is that not
only doesn't does it a waste and moving

00:40:37.999 --> 00:40:38.009
only doesn't does it a waste and moving
 

00:40:38.009 --> 00:40:40.339
only doesn't does it a waste and moving
out of the system but it improves the

00:40:40.339 --> 00:40:40.349
out of the system but it improves the
 

00:40:40.349 --> 00:40:42.680
out of the system but it improves the
overall health of the person and when

00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:42.690
overall health of the person and when
 

00:40:42.690 --> 00:40:44.749
overall health of the person and when
they start to take the supplements what

00:40:44.749 --> 00:40:44.759
they start to take the supplements what
 

00:40:44.759 --> 00:40:47.240
they start to take the supplements what
then happens is is that the supplements

00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:47.250
then happens is is that the supplements
 

00:40:47.250 --> 00:40:49.759
