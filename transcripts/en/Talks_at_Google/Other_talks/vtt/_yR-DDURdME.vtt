00:00:00.539 --> 00:00:06.859
&gt;&gt; Stuart: This book is genuinely a set of
think pieces about aspects of the American

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:07.859
dream.

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:14.509
Can you tell a little bit about your own personal
background how that shaped your thought patterns

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:15.549
into this book.

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:16.630
&gt;&gt; Tom: Sure.

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:17.790
I am not a baby boomer.

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:18.790
I'm actually older.

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:19.790
I'm an old guy.

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:20.790
I was born in 1940.

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:24.880
So my first memories of life are about World
War II which seems like ancient history to

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.230
all of you.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.100
But it was the greatest single event in the
history of mankind.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.610
I mean, the whole globe was involved.

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.430
And freedom as we know it and democracies
were in peril.

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.730
I mean, the Germans actually had a plan for
what they were going to do when they got here.

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:46.579
They knew about our munitions factories in
New England and they had plans for agriculture.

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:50.120
It was fought on six of the seven continents;
all the seas at the same time.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.830
50 million people perished before that war
was over.

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:57.760
In a way, it made America.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.190
We were in a deep depression before the war
began.

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.690
Everything stopped and was then directed toward
the war effort.

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:12.380
And when the war ended, America became a colossus
on the world stage in terms of its economy.

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.500
We're the great manufacturing center of the
world.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.220
Russia had gone hard into communism.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.039
China was one of those places where on the
map it might as well have said 'beyond here

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:23.039
serpents lie'.

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:26.440
[laughter] We just didn't know what was going
on there.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.580
So these veterans came home who had not known
any prosperity.

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.010
And they went to college in record numbers
and married in record numbers.

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:37.530
And they built the America that you all have
today.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.080
I was part of that wave as a young man.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.290
My father had dropped out of school at the
age of 10.

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.369
My mother couldn't afford to go to college
because it cost 100 dollars a year.

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.260
She was 16 at the time.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:50.260
Very bright woman.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.490
They had these really working class values.

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:53.510
And that's how they raised me.

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.670
We moved around a lot from job to job.

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.130
And I had,from an early age, a real curiosity
about the world war, about social interaction

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.130
in the community.

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.630
I was always fascinated by politics.

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:12.639
And got to a small city, by South Dakota standards,
which helped change my life.

00:02:12.639 --> 00:02:17.519
I met the woman to whom I am still married
there lot brighter than I am.

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:19.409
And we have had a wonderful adventure.

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:22.609
And we set off not quite knowing what to expect.

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:28.579
But we were pure products of the 1950s when
everything seemed possible for our generation.

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:29.900
And America was changing.

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.200
The Civil Rights Movement was underway.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.579
Even though we were engaged in the Cold War
with the Russians.

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:42.470
The field was wide open for people who had
some ambition and some ability.

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.459
And in those days if you came out of college
and went to work for IBM.

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.169
Steve did at one point.

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:50.359
Probably became a lifer.

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:53.010
The job was going to be there and you could
count on it.

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.769
And things had proportion.

00:02:54.769 --> 00:03:01.519
The first home my wife and I bought in California
was $42,500 in Los Angeles.

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:05.250
Up in the hills, beautiful home.

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.459
And it was in a prosperous little cul-de-sac.

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.129
I was making, because I was in television
news and doing pretty well at the time, I

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:13.680
was making $40,000 at the time.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.920
I was buying a home that matched my salary.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.930
So that and gas cost 30 cents a gallon.

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.809
[laughter] And California had 20 million people.

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:25.879
Now 35 million people.

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:29.510
So life was kind of good for us.

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.760
And then the 60s hit and the boomers -- the
people who came after the war -- began to

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.069
push back against what their parents represented.

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:41.769
Because even though I did call it the greatest
generation, I often say it wasn't the perfect

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:42.769
generation.

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:47.719
They came out of the war with a regimented
idea of how things should work.

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:50.279
And the counterculture grew out of the baby
boomers.

00:03:50.279 --> 00:03:51.279
They had more freedom.

00:03:51.279 --> 00:03:54.019
They were more highly educated.

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:57.519
And they also had economic freedom, because
there was real prosperity in the land and

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:03.469
they could drop out of school and still get
a check from home and do what they did.

00:04:03.469 --> 00:04:06.169
That's the kind of short arc of my life.

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:09.849
And then I rose to certain heights in journalism.

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:12.249
Began to write as well as to broadcast.

00:04:12.249 --> 00:04:18.350
And began to raise a family: Daughter at Stanford,
daughter at Berkeley, daughter at Duke.

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.520
The Stanford daughter now is a physician at
San Francisco.

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:26.760
The Berkeley daughter is a senior executive
at Warner Music and the Duke daughter is a

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:31.500
psychotherapist who has a new book called
Fortytude, about women in their 40s.

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.850
So we led this kind of quintessential American
life.

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:39.150
But in our family and certainly in my profession
I never stop taking the temperature of our

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:44.510
society and where we fit in and what was changing.

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:47.090
And I was, always had this great curiosity.

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:53.040
And the business that you're now in, I was
aware of very early and made a point of getting

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:59.000
to know some of the pioneers, Bill Gates particularly
when Microsoft came online and helped bring

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:07.310
him to NBC because I knew it would be transformative
not just in the software but in the content

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:10.280
of it and how we share that information.

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:15.750
And I wrote a book called the Greatest Generation
about World War II and that was in 1998.

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:19.090
And it was kind of a wake up call to the baby
boomers.

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:21.730
They didn't realize what their parents had
gone through.

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:27.440
Through the depression and then during the
war and how they sacrificed to make life possible

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.110
for their children.

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:36.460
That started a national dialogue across the
country about values and how we invest in

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:37.460
citizens.

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:42.370
Then we kind of lost our way at the end of
the 20th century it seems to me.

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:48.960
When 9/11 happened, some of you were very
young at that time or I guess all of you were

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.110
alive but you were very young.

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:54.000
But it had a electrifying effect on the country.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.680
It just united the country briefly.

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:01.800
In which we began to pay attention to where
we stood in the world and the fact that we

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:06.740
had enemies came as a surprise to us even
though we'd been attacked in embassies and

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:12.650
on our warships in the Persian Gulf.

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:14.670
And we let that slide away.

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:20.750
And so, for the last four or five years especially,
it seems to me that we've kind of lost our

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:27.380
way in terms of where we want to get to and
how we get there as a society as a political

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:31.990
culture as an economy and how we fit into
the world.

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:37.620
In 1980 when Ronald Reagan took the country
through a deliberate recession to try to correct

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:43.740
for inflation, when we emerged from that it
was still a pretty much clear playing field

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:45.310
for America.

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:50.700
We didn't have China, India, Brazil and Russia
as economic competitors.

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:54.700
Oil was around 15 dollars a barrel.

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:58.200
And as you well know, the cost of energy falls
through everything.

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:03.200
In the last four or five years it seems to
me that we've been knocked off our bearings.

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:07.320
So I'll wrap up this little narrative with
a question that I hear because I go across

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:13.370
the country more than any other one from parents
my age and younger.

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:17.580
"Will our children have better lives than
us?"

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:19.980
Because that's always been the essence of
the American dream.

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:23.139
My children will have a better life than I
do.

00:07:23.139 --> 00:07:26.200
I've been trying to recalibrate that question.

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:29.990
It's meant mostly in the past will they make
more money?

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:31.530
Will they have a larger house?

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:36.389
Will they have more cars, more freedom to
travel because of their financial security?

00:07:36.389 --> 00:07:42.640
And so, we ought to change that equation from
quantitative to qualitative.

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:47.280
Will the next generation give us a more just
society?

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:49.590
More economic opportunity?

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:56.370
Will we begin to educate all parts of America
so that they can have their place in the American

00:07:56.370 --> 00:07:57.620
dream?

00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:59.310
That led to this book.

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:04.500
And so, in the course of the book, I talk
about proportion when it comes to housing,

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:09.540
about the importance of all of us getting
involved in education, about the place of

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:10.540
journalism.

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:15.650
I'm a grandparent now so I have a sense of
urgency about what I'm leaving my grandchildren,

00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:18.270
the life that they'll have.

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:25.250
And the question that I keep coming back to,
and then providing an answer for it, is the

00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:27.620
role of all of us.

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:32.910
100 years from now historians will look back
on this time and they won't make a judgment

00:08:32.910 --> 00:08:40.829
just about Herman Cain and his current problems
or president Obama or Bill O'Reilly on Fox

00:08:40.829 --> 00:08:47.589
News or Rachel Maddow, what the latest Google
app is or dispute with Android they're going

00:08:47.589 --> 00:08:50.040
to make a judgment about all of us.

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:51.819
What did we leave behind?

00:08:51.819 --> 00:08:57.139
How did we respond to this challenge in our
nation?

00:08:57.139 --> 00:09:00.269
The 20th century was called the American century.

00:09:00.269 --> 00:09:03.000
And I think it led us to a certain amount
of hubris.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.730
We thought it would always be that way.

00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:06.910
Conditions have changed.

00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:10.449
So what I'm trying to do is just start a dialogue.

00:09:10.449 --> 00:09:13.329
Kick start a conversation, if you will.

00:09:13.329 --> 00:09:17.759
And all of you should be front and center
in that because you are inventing the new

00:09:17.759 --> 00:09:19.100
world.

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:26.309
&gt;&gt; Stuart: Both in the Greatest Generation
and in this book, you have as one of the themes

00:09:26.309 --> 00:09:37.740
that the early experience of the depression
and then wartime -- pain and heroism.

00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:43.850
It was what sort of led in a very real way
to the positive aspects of the 50s and 60s.

00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:47.170
&gt;&gt; Tom: I'll just tell you one thing that
some of you probably will appreciate.

00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:51.860
When I told my daughter I was writing a book,
in effect, what I hope would be kind

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:56.360
broadly, speaking metaphorically, a letter
to my grandchildren, she said, "I don't want

00:09:56.360 --> 00:10:00.860
some sappy letter [laughter] about your school
days when you had to wade through the snow

00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:02.550
to get to school.

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:03.740
You didn't have as much as we do.

00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:04.800
I don't want that."

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:07.420
I said that's not what it's going to be about,
Ashley.

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:12.040
[laughter] And the Greatest Generation which
I wrote about, which I often say, these are

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:15.610
in some cases your great grandparents.

00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:19.759
I do think they were formed first by the Great
Depression.

00:10:19.759 --> 00:10:24.480
When they were your age there were no opportunities
remotely like what you have.

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:33.649
It was about shared sacrifice and shared jobs
and shared housing and shared food because

00:10:33.649 --> 00:10:36.939
it's hard to imagine how desperate times were.

00:10:36.939 --> 00:10:42.730
It was just a little passage in this book
that--, about a man who kept a very careful

00:10:42.730 --> 00:10:47.970
diary in Youngstown, Ohio, which was a great
steel mill center at the time.

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:52.119
By Christmas in 1934, the steel mills were
operating at 12% capacity.

00:10:52.119 --> 00:10:55.110
And that was the heart of American industrial
empire.

00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:59.759
People were trying to sell their passbooks
from banks for 70 cents on the dollar.

00:10:59.759 --> 00:11:02.749
Hunger marchers were walking down the streets
not like Occupy Wall Street.

00:11:02.749 --> 00:11:06.899
They were on their way to Washington, singing
the Battle Hymn of the Republic because they

00:11:06.899 --> 00:11:09.209
were in danger of starving to death.

00:11:09.209 --> 00:11:12.540
So they came out of all that and then they
were thrown into the war.

00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:20.320
And, when they got thrown into military regimentation,
in uniform and then at home, it accelerated

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:23.270
their maturity because they learned to work
together.

00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:24.519
They developed discipline.

00:11:24.519 --> 00:11:27.259
They knew about risk management at the time.

00:11:27.259 --> 00:11:31.019
Back here, they were inventing everything
on the fly.

00:11:31.019 --> 00:11:37.369
I talked to a machinist at Boeing who worked
-- he was a farm boy--, but he was very handy

00:11:37.369 --> 00:11:38.829
with his hands.

00:11:38.829 --> 00:11:43.449
They were building the B-29, which was going
to deliver the long range atomic weapons to

00:11:43.449 --> 00:11:45.850
Japan to help out the war.

00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:51.959
They were building it 24/7 and he said engineers
would leave us drawings on yellow legal pads

00:11:51.959 --> 00:11:58.389
the night before and we would lay the parts
overnight by kind of eyeballing.

00:11:58.389 --> 00:12:00.560
Think about the invention of that.

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:05.759
And so, that I think helped form who they
were.

00:12:05.759 --> 00:12:09.010
And it created the foundation that we're all
the beneficiaries of.

00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:14.300
You, in your own way, are creating this whole
new technology.

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:17.550
And you're finding new ways to advance its
use every day.

00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:19.500
So you're a part of that.

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:25.100
But what I would hope that your generation
would do would be to look beyond that technology.

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:28.920
The line that I use is -- and I'm fascinated
by it by the way.

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:34.160
I'm not particularly skilled at it, but I'm
on it constantly.

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:39.509
The line that I use is that "you're not going
to get rid of global poverty by hitting delete

00:12:39.509 --> 00:12:43.490
or change global warming by hitting backspace.

00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:51.790
And no text message will ever replace a whispered
'I love you' or holding hands on a first date.

00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:58.690
Because essentially we advance in human kind
by putting our boots on the ground and getting

00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:04.050
our hands dirty and spending nights in scary
places and making a commitment that advances

00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:07.429
our own passions and our sense of justice.

00:13:07.429 --> 00:13:13.010
And we have to do that as individuals and
then find like-minded individuals to form

00:13:13.010 --> 00:13:14.689
coalitions to advance that."

00:13:14.689 --> 00:13:15.899
&gt;&gt; Stuart: Fascinating.

00:13:15.899 --> 00:13:22.870
If I can change topics a little bit -- you
were the only anchor in Berlin, I believe--,

00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:23.970
&gt;&gt;Tom: I think; yeah.

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:28.839
&gt;&gt;Stuart: --the night the wall fell at one
of those defining moments?

00:13:28.839 --> 00:13:34.000
Curious your thoughts about the multiple outbreaks
of freedom that we've seen.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:40.249
That, of course, the opening of shackles on
a number of eastern European countries and

00:13:40.249 --> 00:13:50.100
then the past year, the quite surprising,
middle eastern, genuine popular revolutions.

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:51.100
Your thoughts on these outbreaks.

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:52.939
&gt;&gt; Tom: You are living in the age of freedom.

00:13:52.939 --> 00:13:59.309
I mean, there has never been as much on planet
earth as there is now in terms of free choice.

00:13:59.309 --> 00:14:04.600
Not just in the individual lives you have
and the technology that enables you to practice

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:05.850
that.

00:14:05.850 --> 00:14:09.610
But the Arab Spring was a very dramatic development
in your lifetime.

00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:11.420
That part of the world will never be the same
again.

00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:17.510
It was proceeded by obviously the both fall
of the Soviet empire and the redefinition

00:14:17.510 --> 00:14:19.509
of communism in China.

00:14:19.509 --> 00:14:21.670
People always ask me about the biggest story
I covered.

00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:24.720
And I always say 9/11 was the single hardest
day I ever had.

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:28.269
We didn't know what was coming next and what
the consequences would be and it played out

00:14:28.269 --> 00:14:29.559
for some time.

00:14:29.559 --> 00:14:35.480
But I believe in my professional career, the
more consequential story in the long reach

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:38.839
of history, was the collapse of the Soviet
Union.

00:14:38.839 --> 00:14:44.220
The end of the communism in that part of the
world and the liberation of people in the

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:47.019
Balkans and around the Southern Rim of Russia.

00:14:47.019 --> 00:14:48.720
And it's still playing out at this point.

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:50.050
We're still trying to find our way.

00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:55.860
When I first went to China, it was essentially
a 19th or 18th century country.

00:14:55.860 --> 00:15:00.050
In part of Beijing I'd go for a run in the
morning down to the hutong, part of the which

00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:02.959
were the communal areas of Beijing.

00:15:02.959 --> 00:15:08.769
And people would be cooking and doing their
morning toilette outside, but it's by lamplight

00:15:08.769 --> 00:15:10.579
and they would be cooking with charcoal stoves.

00:15:10.579 --> 00:15:15.450
And I'd come back with soot coming out of
my ears because the air was so dense.

00:15:15.450 --> 00:15:19.679
I stayed in a peace hotel in shanghai in 1975.

00:15:19.679 --> 00:15:23.970
The rats were as big as cocker spaniels going
through the hallways.

00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:26.910
And think of the transformation since then.

00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:28.850
It's very dramatic.

00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:33.739
It's been exhilarating for someone of my age
to be witness of that.

00:15:33.739 --> 00:15:43.489
&gt;&gt; Stuart: Now at least some of the more recent
stories had very strong Twitter etc. aspects.

00:15:43.489 --> 00:15:48.639
Of course the fall of the Berlin wall was
heavily televised.

00:15:48.639 --> 00:15:51.959
And, you know, the media really had an impact.

00:15:51.959 --> 00:15:59.499
What are your thoughts on the role of both
the communication media and the human media

00:15:59.499 --> 00:16:00.499
in these activities.

00:16:00.499 --> 00:16:02.639
&gt;&gt; Tom: Well, I get asked that a lot.

00:16:02.639 --> 00:16:04.760
And I have a surprising answer for older audiences.

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:13.929
I say there's never been a richer journalistic
environment than the one we live in now because

00:16:13.929 --> 00:16:20.730
on your macros or on your PCs, for those of
you who still have one [laughter] Or for any

00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:26.249
of you that have that gives you access to
the Internet, you can with, a key stroke,

00:16:26.249 --> 00:16:29.189
dial up the financial times from London if
you want.

00:16:29.189 --> 00:16:33.019
You can get the latest release from the Saudi
foreign ministry.

00:16:33.019 --> 00:16:36.269
You can get the offerings of the think tanks
in Washington.

00:16:36.269 --> 00:16:38.410
I'm on the board of the Council of Foreign
Relations.

00:16:38.410 --> 00:16:44.690
We got a first rate website that every day
you can dial into it, in effect, and get a

00:16:44.690 --> 00:16:48.800
quick brief what's going on that's very important
internationally.

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:52.509
But you can no longer be a couch potato.

00:16:52.509 --> 00:16:57.139
My generation grew up with the idea you go
to the front porch, get the paper, read it

00:16:57.139 --> 00:17:00.350
in the morning, see a little bit of the Today
Show, come home at night watch the evening

00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:01.699
news; that's it.

00:17:01.699 --> 00:17:03.639
Those were your choices.

00:17:03.639 --> 00:17:06.340
That's no longer the case as you well know.

00:17:06.340 --> 00:17:10.370
But you have to be proactive in where you
get that information.

00:17:10.370 --> 00:17:15.150
And develop your own test for whether it's
reliable and credible and useful to you.

00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:21.370
I have a friend in Montana who's a very apolitical
woman and she goes on the Internet a lot and

00:17:21.370 --> 00:17:24.880
she'll come to me wide-eyed and say, "You're
not going to believe what I read on the Internet

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:25.880
this morning."

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:27.220
And I said, "You're right.

00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:29.190
I'm not going to believe it."

00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:36.240
[laughter] So I do think that we have to develop
a new kind of vigilance, if you will.

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:39.500
Bill Clinton says that we've got an atomized
society.

00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:41.570
That's a pretty appropriate way of putting
it.

00:17:41.570 --> 00:17:46.610
We probably s ought to have some sites that
are fact checking sites and places we can

00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:50.040
go to make sure that that's true or not true.

00:17:50.040 --> 00:18:01.710
&gt;&gt; Stuart: Have you any thoughts, following
upon that if I may, this tension between integration/disintegration

00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:07.740
of groups -- not everybody got to watch you
every night with a reasonably authoritative

00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:08.740
news story.

00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:12.030
But as you said you won't believe this one.

00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:16.090
Or more to the point, you will believe it
but you're not talking to anybody else.

00:18:16.090 --> 00:18:17.370
&gt;&gt; Tom: It's a fraction of the landscape.

00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:23.370
I'll give you the short, short history of
especially television news at the network

00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:24.730
level.

00:18:24.730 --> 00:18:29.860
That was, in some ways, domestically as transformative
as what you're doing.

00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:35.000
When Huntley, Brinkley, and Walter Cronkite
began their broadcast across the country for

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.900
the first time if you lived in the remote
reaches of the Cascades Mountains in Washington

00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:43.190
or in the piney woods of Georgia, you were
seeing the same thing at the same time and

00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:48.870
you could make decisions about the direction
of your country or what was going on in Washington

00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:53.150
and be aware of the culture that was growing
up in different parts of America.

00:18:53.150 --> 00:18:57.240
Now, of course, that screen is much wider.

00:18:57.240 --> 00:19:01.590
It's got many more -- many, many, more -- parts
to it.

00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:06.780
And there should always be a role for what
we do in the evening news.

00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:11.530
Brian Williams and Diane Sawyer and now Scott
Pelley.

00:19:11.530 --> 00:19:13.870
They still deliver to lots of viewers every
night.

00:19:13.870 --> 00:19:16.150
Lots of eyeballs.

00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:20.680
Here's a question some of you don't think
about a lot because you're going to a different

00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:22.730
media but I do this with older audiences.

00:19:22.730 --> 00:19:29.390
Bill O'Reilly is a hugely popular figure in
the cable universe and he never tires of telling

00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:32.800
you how popular he is by the way.

00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:36.580
[laughter] And he often says I've got the
No. 1 show.

00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:39.320
And people think he has this enormous audience.

00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:45.800
He has half the audience of the last rated
show on the evening news -- Scott Pelley.

00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:48.330
And when Katie was there, the audience had
really gone down.

00:19:48.330 --> 00:19:51.430
She still had twice the audience Bill O'Reilly
does.

00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:56.490
Every night those broadcasts deliver 23 million
viewers.

00:19:56.490 --> 00:19:59.700
Divided by 3, Brian is gratefully still in
the lead.

00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:04.930
That's still a lot of people looking for reliable
sources of information.

00:20:04.930 --> 00:20:09.680
The culture of journalism should always be
important to us in our lives.

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:12.320
It will come to us in different ways now.

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:19.410
We must remember that the press is the oxygen
for a free society.

00:20:19.410 --> 00:20:24.680
People need access to information that is
fairly gathered and tells them about what's

00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:29.620
going on in their name around them so they
can make decisions about their own life.

00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:34.240
Now, I'm going to just let you in on one other
small conversation I had over the weekend

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:38.070
with my friend Walter Isaacson.

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:41.990
I worry that this book would become road kill
on the Steve Jobs expressway, by the way,

00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:45.150
[laughter] because of the enormous and appropriate,
understandable popularity of that book.

00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:49.910
And Walter and I were talking.

00:20:49.910 --> 00:20:53.830
--we were both on Meet the Press on Sunday--.
and he said something that I hadn't thought

00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:54.830
enough about.

00:20:54.830 --> 00:20:57.380
We're both old traditional book people.

00:20:57.380 --> 00:21:01.750
We like printed pages and we like covers that
are first editions.

00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:07.170
And he said, "I'm making a real point of buying
as many first editions as I can, because 20

00:21:07.170 --> 00:21:12.560
years from now I don't think it's going to
be as easy for me to call up again the electronic

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:17.300
books and to know where they are and to keep
that library in the same way."

00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:20.380
And he said, "there's still a magic about
the printed page."

00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:23.529
I guess I feel that way as well.

00:21:23.529 --> 00:21:26.890
&gt;&gt; Stuart: I'll ask one or two more questions,
if I may.

00:21:26.890 --> 00:21:31.730
People should be thinking about questions
they'd like to ask.

00:21:31.730 --> 00:21:34.370
We have two mics set up.

00:21:34.370 --> 00:21:41.390
In both the Greatest Generation books and
this one there's a very interesting emphasis

00:21:41.390 --> 00:21:49.130
-- partly reflective of your background growing
up in middle of the country, small America

00:21:49.130 --> 00:21:52.670
-- and then these various explosions.

00:21:52.670 --> 00:21:59.520
It's fascinating comments about your own now
extended family which has people from -- everything

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:05.460
from east coast, Russian Jewish family to
Cherokee background and so forth.

00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:08.130
It's sort of a fascinating counterpoint.

00:22:08.130 --> 00:22:15.610
To what extent do you think that the shaping
of America is being affected by the shifts

00:22:15.610 --> 00:22:20.429
of the center of gravity of people and of
backgrounds like that.

00:22:20.429 --> 00:22:24.030
&gt;&gt; Tom: Well, you know, America is always
a petri dish.

00:22:24.030 --> 00:22:26.560
There's always something going on within it.

00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:29.490
That's what makes it such a fascinating place.

00:22:29.490 --> 00:22:33.170
We have always been and we always be an immigrant
nation.

00:22:33.170 --> 00:22:38.310
Outside of our native American population,
the rest of us all came from somewhere else.

00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:41.290
And there's kind of a social Darwinism about
that.

00:22:41.290 --> 00:22:46.730
They came here because they had ambition and
they wanted opportunity.

00:22:46.730 --> 00:22:52.850
And they wanted to, you know, advance their
-- not just their families, but their dreams

00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:56.670
and their ambitions as well.

00:22:56.670 --> 00:23:00.360
And you know, we are seeing a different mix
now in our population.

00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:05.810
There's a lot of paranoia in the southwest
about illegal immigration coming across the

00:23:05.810 --> 00:23:06.810
border.

00:23:06.810 --> 00:23:11.310
Some of it is justified because of the violence
that has been visited on those parts of the

00:23:11.310 --> 00:23:13.900
world and the influence of the drug cartels.

00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:21.980
I often say, however, that there's less concern
for example about Asian Americans moving into

00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:23.150
the neighborhood.

00:23:23.150 --> 00:23:30.440
In part because they come here with a well-defined
idea of what they want to do -- for the most

00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:35.300
part, I can't make absolute generalizations,
but that's mostly the case.

00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:39.161
When I was a young reporter in Berkeley, in
the 1960s, in the free speech movement with

00:23:39.161 --> 00:23:44.680
Mario Salvio and the place was filled all
day every day with protests against the war,

00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:46.520
protests for free speech.

00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:52.300
I go to Berkeley now and most of the faces
are Asian Americans and they're engineering

00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:53.300
students.

00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:58.610
You know they have a whole different kind
of destination in mind for them.

00:23:58.610 --> 00:24:00.360
And that's how this country works.

00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:02.940
We're constantly evolving and changing.

00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:07.980
And I hope always trying to become more than
the sum of our parts.

00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:11.640
That's I think a simple formula, but I think
it's an important one.

00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:17.930
With my grandchildren, I want to -- my eldest
granddaughter is now a freshman in high school.

00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:21.980
But when she was in the 7 grade I went to
her school with other people about my age

00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:24.150
and the teacher did a smart thing.

00:24:24.150 --> 00:24:30.720
She said, "write down -- the grandparents
and the 7th graders -- what were the best

00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:35.770
memories that you have the most -- I suppose
-- striking memories you have of your 7th

00:24:35.770 --> 00:24:39.400
grade experience and we'll ask the 7th graders
here to do that.

00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:43.020
We all talked about the fact we were segregated
racially.

00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:47.500
There was only one who grew up in the Bronx
who went to school where they had people of

00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:48.500
color.

00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:51.290
The rest of us all went to all white schools.

00:24:51.290 --> 00:24:57.050
And of course, they began the 7th graders
with computers and the place they play in

00:24:57.050 --> 00:25:00.000
their lives and the fact they had access to
them.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.230
We were the radio generation.

00:25:01.230 --> 00:25:06.480
[chuckles] That's how antiquated we were.

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:12.020
I thought it was a very useful exercise to
see how the country has changed.

00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:19.430
&gt;&gt; Stuart: One final question, if I may, before
asking other people to line up if you would.

00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:24.050
The basic structure of this book is a series
of chapters on various topics.

00:25:24.050 --> 00:25:32.530
Each chapter basically begins with a quote
or vignette, then a section about quote "the

00:25:32.530 --> 00:25:33.530
past".

00:25:33.530 --> 00:25:35.020
They're neatly labeled.

00:25:35.020 --> 00:25:38.120
Then the "present" and then the "promise".

00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:44.700
I'm very curious what you think is the real
promise -- what you think we should be doing

00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:45.980
to get there.

00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:55.130
&gt;&gt; Tom: Well, the promise of this country
-- and our rule of law, and foundation in

00:25:55.130 --> 00:26:02.470
law and in opportunity and the migrant experience
that we have and the pluralism of America

00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:09.030
to say nothing of the extraordinary resources
we have both natural and man-made.

00:26:09.030 --> 00:26:14.080
I live all across America from the west to
the east and back and forth and it still takes

00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:16.150
my breath away when I fly over this country.

00:26:16.150 --> 00:26:21.440
And I believe that the 100 best high institutions
of higher learning in the world here.

00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:25.950
People come here because they can be educated
here.

00:26:25.950 --> 00:26:26.950
Companies like Google.

00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:32.750
I mean, which didn't exist that long ago and
it's now defining this new world.

00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:34.630
So that's the promise.

00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:41.210
The promise then requires the rest of us to
work even harder at fulfilling that promise

00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:44.050
and keeping it alive and keeping it elevated.

00:26:44.050 --> 00:26:45.800
Yeah, some of it is hard.

00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:47.590
There's no question about that.

00:26:47.590 --> 00:26:54.420
But when the historians look back on our time
I would like to think they would say America

00:26:54.420 --> 00:26:59.850
lived up to its promise and it's not just
a matter of trying to be "We're number 1;

00:26:59.850 --> 00:27:01.610
we're number 1".

00:27:01.610 --> 00:27:07.290
It's how you provide a quality of life for
your citizens.

00:27:07.290 --> 00:27:10.390
That's what the ultimate promise is.

00:27:10.390 --> 00:27:14.430
There are great challenges out there, but
it seems to me that we're up to it.

00:27:14.430 --> 00:27:18.830
I'll just tell you one other thing about Bush,
when he talked about the past president -- the

00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:19.870
promise.

00:27:19.870 --> 00:27:24.310
When I began to write this book, there were
two things that prompted it.

00:27:24.310 --> 00:27:30.660
One was that I interviewed President Obama
in Dresden in the spring of 2009, the 65th

00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:35.140
anniversary of Normandy, the greatest military
invasion of World War II.

00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:39.520
And Dresden had been fired bombed to rubble
during World War II and then it spent the

00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:42.840
next 40 years behind communist lines.

00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:48.300
But here was a city and a country that was
reinventing itself after its shameful past

00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:53.290
of the 30s and really doing a pretty amazing
job.

00:27:53.290 --> 00:27:58.560
So when I was interviewing president Obama,
our first African-American president an extraordinary

00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:03.470
transition in my lifetime, I said casually
to him.

00:28:03.470 --> 00:28:06.180
I was in Berlin the night the wall came down.

00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:08.350
And he said to me, "Yeah, I know, Tom, I watched.

00:28:08.350 --> 00:28:10.020
I was in law school at the time."

00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:13.250
"Oh my God, he was in law school at the time."

00:28:13.250 --> 00:28:17.200
[laughter] So that was kind of the opening
that I had in mind for the book.

00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:21.010
My editors came back to me and said, "you
know?

00:28:21.010 --> 00:28:27.030
People buy books based, now, on the really
first two pages of it.

00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:32.680
And that's a wonderful opening, but we need
to come out a little faster and a little harder."

00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:36.540
In journalism, it's called tightening up the
lead.

00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:37.540
And I got it.

00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:38.540
I was a journalist.

00:28:38.540 --> 00:28:42.470
So I went back and rewrote the opening to
try and engage people.

00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:48.690
And the line I came up with which is central
to the book is "what happened to the America

00:28:48.690 --> 00:28:49.780
I thought I knew?"

00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:52.370
And it's been pretty interesting to me.

00:28:52.370 --> 00:28:56.320
That's the one I get repeated back to me by
a lot of people because they read that.

00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:58.750
&gt;&gt; Stuart: Thank you very much.

00:28:58.750 --> 00:29:04.390
Let me just start going to the -- we appear
to have at least four people on each side.

00:29:04.390 --> 00:29:05.520
&gt;&gt; Tom: If you would speak right up.

00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:11.070
One of the conditions of people my age in
broadcasting is we all have severe hearing

00:29:11.070 --> 00:29:12.070
loss.

00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:13.200
We all had those things in our ears all those
years.

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:15.950
&gt;&gt;Stuart: Ouch
&gt;&gt;Tom: And Walter Cronkite in a setting like

00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:20.310
this -- wonderful man -- he was asked a couple
questions.

00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:21.690
He was having a hard time with them.

00:29:21.690 --> 00:29:26.070
He said, "the acoustics" -- and he said, "oh,
it's not the acoustics, I'm deaf as a damn

00:29:26.070 --> 00:29:27.070
post."

00:29:27.070 --> 00:29:30.290
[laughter] So speak right up.

00:29:30.290 --> 00:29:35.810
&gt;&gt; Stuart: And let me ask our colleagues back
there to adjust accordingly please.

00:29:35.810 --> 00:29:40.920
&gt;&gt; Male #1: Tom, first of all it's a great
honor for you to be with us here today but

00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:43.090
even a greater honor is for me to ask you
a question.

00:29:43.090 --> 00:29:48.630
Can you give us a commentary on the Republican
nomination process, who do you think is going

00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:53.690
to winning this? [laughter] t Also what's
the general election -- the presidential election

00:29:53.690 --> 00:29:56.650
-- going to be like.

00:29:56.650 --> 00:29:58.950
&gt;&gt;Tom: I'm going to hand this out free of
charge.

00:29:58.950 --> 00:30:06.080
[laughter] I'm going to give you the best
line to keep in mind for the next nine months

00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:08.420
-- maybe even longer.

00:30:08.420 --> 00:30:09.950
It's been my vote.

00:30:09.950 --> 00:30:13.950
And I've been covering American presidential
politics for almost 50 years.

00:30:13.950 --> 00:30:16.500
I believe in the if UFO theory.

00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:19.030
The unforeseen will occur.

00:30:19.030 --> 00:30:24.840
We don't know yet what conditions will exist
when we go into the booth in November of next

00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:25.870
year.

00:30:25.870 --> 00:30:29.200
We don't know who the candidates are going
to be at this point, what the tickets are

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:30.620
going to be.

00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:34.850
A perfect demonstration of how quickly things
can change is this past week with Herman Cain

00:30:34.850 --> 00:30:37.120
and charges of sexual harassment.

00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:41.740
The hardest thing in the world to do -- I
honestly believe -- in terms of having personal

00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:47.560
courage that doesn't require you to face enemy
combatants, is to run for president of the

00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:48.560
United States.

00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:52.850
Friend of mine who was a senior political
advisor so Jack Kennedy said if you want to

00:30:52.850 --> 00:30:56.611
run for president of the United States you
have to be prepared to strip naked every day

00:30:56.611 --> 00:31:02.550
at high noon and take a bath in the most popular
public square in town.

00:31:02.550 --> 00:31:05.170
[laughter] Every day during the campaign.

00:31:05.170 --> 00:31:06.980
Because that's how you're examined.

00:31:06.980 --> 00:31:13.800
I would hope that we would break out in terms
of the dialogue and conversation that we've

00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:14.800
been having.

00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:21.190
Most of these Republican debates thus far
have been either kind of persnickety attacks

00:31:21.190 --> 00:31:24.030
on one another or only about job creation.

00:31:24.030 --> 00:31:26.120
And that's the central question.

00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:32.480
But they have made what effectively are kind
of grandiose promises without any backing

00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:33.480
them up.

00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:36.250
There hasn't been enough examination of that
so far.

00:31:36.250 --> 00:31:42.000
I was struck a week ago by the fact that Rick
Perry was going hard after Mitt Romney because

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:46.930
he may have hired, unwittingly or otherwise,
an illegal gardener.

00:31:46.930 --> 00:31:53.790
And the next day Muammar Gaddafi was shot
as we changed the future of Libya.

00:31:53.790 --> 00:31:59.260
So the contrast between arguing about illegal
gardeners or getting rid of Gaddafi was fairly

00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:00.260
striking to me.

00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:05.260
[laughter] And I think we need to worry a
little more about that -- the Gaddafi experience

00:32:05.260 --> 00:32:07.340
-- than the illegal gardeners, quite honestly.

00:32:07.340 --> 00:32:09.860
&gt;&gt; Female #1: Thank you so much for coming.

00:32:09.860 --> 00:32:13.130
I was wondering who your most challenging
interview was.

00:32:13.130 --> 00:32:14.130
&gt;&gt; Tom: Pardon me?

00:32:14.130 --> 00:32:17.430
&gt;&gt; Female #1: Who your most challenging interview
was.

00:32:17.430 --> 00:32:20.380
&gt;&gt; Tom: I get asked that a lot.

00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:25.300
I was the first journalist to ever interview
a general secretary of the communist party

00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:27.900
in the Soviet Union and it was Mikhail Gorbachev.

00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:30.690
It was a signal about how they were changing.

00:32:30.690 --> 00:32:35.790
That was tough because we knew that he wanted
to send a message to the west but at the same

00:32:35.790 --> 00:32:40.000
time he had to play to the hard liners back
in Moscow.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:44.350
And it was going to be one hour simultaneously
translated.

00:32:44.350 --> 00:32:45.540
It was quite successful.

00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:49.330
It got a lot of good reviews and it was the
beginning of a long friendship that I have

00:32:49.330 --> 00:32:51.330
with him to this day.

00:32:51.330 --> 00:32:56.160
But it was very tough because he had no experience
with a reporter before, certainly with an

00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:58.150
American reporter.

00:32:58.150 --> 00:33:02.550
When I went in to do the interview, the arrangements
had taken nine months.

00:33:02.550 --> 00:33:08.890
Typically, the Russians in those days were
still doing things in a Stone Age way.

00:33:08.890 --> 00:33:16.200
They had put their own microphone on him and
it looked like a bad sculptor's idea of a

00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:17.200
clenched fist.

00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:21.680
It was this piece of iron hanging off his
jacket.

00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:26.059
So I just signaled to our audio technician,
"we need to change that."

00:33:26.059 --> 00:33:27.980
And I reached over and I took his microphone
off.

00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:29.600
And as I was taking it off.

00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:34.442
"My God, I'm just reaching over without telling
him I'm taking the general secretary of the

00:33:34.442 --> 00:33:39.420
communist party who has an entire nuclear
arsenal without saying."

00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:41.170
He's staring at me.

00:33:41.170 --> 00:33:46.900
And I said, "I'm sorry Mr. Secretary, but
this is what I have to do on my job every

00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:47.900
day."

00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:48.900
Through the translator.

00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:51.800
And it came back through the translation and
he said, "you would not believe what I have

00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:56.140
to do on my job every day."

00:33:56.140 --> 00:33:59.230
[laughter] And that was a challenging interview.

00:33:59.230 --> 00:34:01.610
But I would say this.

00:34:01.610 --> 00:34:06.860
When you interview heads of state, they're
pretty practiced and it's tough to get them

00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:10.370
to get spontaneous with you.

00:34:10.370 --> 00:34:12.250
Margaret Thatcher was always an enormous challenge.

00:34:12.250 --> 00:34:13.880
She would just eat us for breakfast.

00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:17.530
The reporters would sit there and she would
just swat us aside.

00:34:17.530 --> 00:34:20.340
She was very self-confident about what she
was doing.

00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:22.310
Bill Clinton could talk about anything.

00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:25.950
You just light him up and he'd take off in
about nine different directions.

00:34:25.950 --> 00:34:32.000
[laughter] So that was always fun, but it
was also challenging.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:37.030
But the fact is in the long many years I've
been doing this, the most impressive people

00:34:37.030 --> 00:34:42.129
I've interviewed are people whose names I
didn't know because they were people doing

00:34:42.129 --> 00:34:45.670
courageous things not expecting any attention
or credit for it.

00:34:45.670 --> 00:34:48.690
It really began in the Civil Rights Movement
in the south.

00:34:48.690 --> 00:34:50.840
I'll never forget a night in America's Georgia.

00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:52.270
The town was a tinderbox.

00:34:52.270 --> 00:34:55.090
It was ready to go up.

00:34:55.090 --> 00:35:00.680
The African-American community had gathered
in their end of town to decide whether to

00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:01.680
march.

00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:05.920
And the white red neck population, including
the Klansmen had said anybody who marches

00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:07.720
tonight will be dead by morning.

00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:11.440
That was just advertised up and down Main
Street.

00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:17.070
Streets were lined with pickup trucks with
broad axes and with shotguns and pistols.

00:35:17.070 --> 00:35:22.360
And when the small Baptist church where the
small African-American leadership had gathered

00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:27.630
broke up the meeting about midnight this beautiful
young woman maybe 19 came out wide-eyed.

00:35:27.630 --> 00:35:29.540
And I said, "what have you decided?"

00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:32.650
And she said, "well, we're going to march."

00:35:32.650 --> 00:35:34.620
And I said, "My God are you terrified?"

00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:35.700
I was scared.

00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:36.710
And she said, "Of course I am."

00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:38.390
I said, "why are you going to march?"

00:35:38.390 --> 00:35:40.460
She said, "We have no other choice."

00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:41.810
And marched.

00:35:41.810 --> 00:35:50.260
And that has lingered with me forever because
it showed the strength of her conviction.

00:35:50.260 --> 00:35:55.210
And the Civil Rights Movement changed our
country so much for the better that it's almost

00:35:55.210 --> 00:35:59.640
hard for me to tell a young audience what
it was like then and how much better off we

00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:00.740
are now.

00:36:00.740 --> 00:36:03.720
Dr. King liberated not just black America.

00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:05.850
He liberated all of us.

00:36:05.850 --> 00:36:09.790
Even the most tolerant of us, he liberated
through law and non-violence.

00:36:09.790 --> 00:36:12.869
And he did it without a cell phone.

00:36:12.869 --> 00:36:14.800
[laughter] He didn't have tweet.

00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:17.830
He didn't have texting.

00:36:17.830 --> 00:36:20.080
He didn't have e-mail.

00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:25.120
He was able to do it through the power of
his conscious, the strength of his voice,

00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:27.640
and his trust in the rule of law in this country.

00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:29.990
It was pretty amazing.

00:36:29.990 --> 00:36:35.260
&gt;&gt; Female #2: The anecdote actually feeds
nicely to my question.

00:36:35.260 --> 00:36:38.980
You've seen social and political movements
rise and and be successful and I'm sure you've

00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:42.940
seen some wither away and just die.

00:36:42.940 --> 00:36:46.470
What are your hopes and predictions about
the Occupy Wall Street movement?

00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:59.970
&gt;&gt; Tom: Well, I watched a lot of social protests
from the ground up in years and this one has

00:36:59.970 --> 00:37:01.920
as little definition as any one I've ever
seen.

00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:04.800
[laughter] I understand the rage.

00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:07.010
I don't know what the goals are at this point.

00:37:07.010 --> 00:37:09.940
And because it's kind of amorphous.

00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:12.950
And it has gotten the country's attention.

00:37:12.950 --> 00:37:17.040
What I have said to -- I have a number of
friends on Wall Street.

00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:20.490
And some of them are even responsible.

00:37:20.490 --> 00:37:25.360
And I've said to them, "if you don't begin
to change from within, there are going to

00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:30.119
be more restrictions placed on you and people
will have less to do with you."

00:37:30.119 --> 00:37:33.680
It's always going to be an important part
of our economy.

00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:35.410
That's how we finance things.

00:37:35.410 --> 00:37:40.220
Google couldn't exist without people providing
money for Google to get started.

00:37:40.220 --> 00:37:45.119
Now Google can buy the world, of course, [laughter]
but in those days it was different.

00:37:45.119 --> 00:37:48.270
And there are people doing good work every
day on Wall Street.

00:37:48.270 --> 00:37:52.030
They need to get together and send a message,
"you can't have the government bailing out

00:37:52.030 --> 00:37:56.290
Wall Street to the tune that it did and then
having everyone at the end of the first quarter

00:37:56.290 --> 00:38:02.210
paying themselves these enormous bonuses and
not expecting some kind of a pushback.

00:38:02.210 --> 00:38:07.960
But I think Occupy Wall Street has to look
within itself and say, "what is it we're trying

00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:09.090
to achieve here?"

00:38:09.090 --> 00:38:15.070
There's a wide range of opinions everything
from nihilism all the way across to labor

00:38:15.070 --> 00:38:16.070
practices.

00:38:16.070 --> 00:38:19.761
And as a result I don't think they're having
the impact that they might otherwise.

00:38:19.761 --> 00:38:20.859
That's what I think.

00:38:20.859 --> 00:38:22.260
&gt;&gt; Stuart: Please.

00:38:22.260 --> 00:38:30.970
&gt;&gt;Male #2: Umm [clears throat]-- do you see
a relationship between the growing inequality

00:38:30.970 --> 00:38:37.140
and distribution of wealth -- the concentration
of wealth in the hands of the few and the

00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:44.790
decline of the communism and the decline of
the laborer -- the power of labor.

00:38:44.790 --> 00:38:46.950
&gt;&gt; Tom: Yeah, I do.

00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:52.440
The 99 versus 1 percent I think is a very
smart way of positing that.

00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:54.730
I happen to be in the 1 percent and I'm grateful
for that.

00:38:54.730 --> 00:38:59.410
I won the lottery in my business in some way,
but it doesn't mean that I'm unmindful of

00:38:59.410 --> 00:39:03.790
what's going on in the other 99 percent because
I have members in my family who are in that.

00:39:03.790 --> 00:39:09.040
And where I grew up, that's where a lot of
people are.

00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:16.020
Again, the whole CEO compensation disparity
between those at the top and those on the

00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:19.619
factory floor needs to be addressed I think.

00:39:19.619 --> 00:39:27.700
I believe very, very much in a meritocracy
incentive and providing that incentive for

00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:29.050
people to do well.

00:39:29.050 --> 00:39:36.020
I know that there are business leaders that
have a very marketable skill and they can

00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:38.560
go to the marketplace and get rewarded for
that.

00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:41.250
But we've kind of just lost control.

00:39:41.250 --> 00:39:43.310
The middle class is losing ground.

00:39:43.310 --> 00:39:45.130
It's not even stalled.

00:39:45.130 --> 00:39:46.500
It's losing ground.

00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:51.720
As you go across the country, you find so
many 2-parent families where both parents

00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:53.710
are working just to keep up.

00:39:53.710 --> 00:39:58.430
And then when the housing bubble burst, they
may have lost their home or it certainly declined

00:39:58.430 --> 00:40:00.520
in value for them.

00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:11.560
Those are the seeds of what I call "domestic
insecurity" -- the strong economy provides

00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:13.250
domestic security in this country.

00:40:13.250 --> 00:40:14.250
Well being.

00:40:14.250 --> 00:40:15.420
A sense that anything is possible.

00:40:15.420 --> 00:40:23.040
It's very hard for people to think of doing
other big jobs like reforming education or

00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:28.570
changing anything including politics if you
don't provide them with opportunity for economic

00:40:28.570 --> 00:40:29.590
security.

00:40:29.590 --> 00:40:32.860
I just don't think it's been addressed very
much.

00:40:32.860 --> 00:40:34.520
Perfect example.

00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:39.290
Almost none of the political dialogue that
we have going on at the moment really specifically

00:40:39.290 --> 00:40:43.950
offers any kind of solution to the mortgage
meltdown in America.

00:40:43.950 --> 00:40:49.260
We have 20 million homes in America that are
either in foreclosure or are stress state

00:40:49.260 --> 00:40:52.370
or in peril of going into a stress state.

00:40:52.370 --> 00:40:56.740
And I have yet to see an imaginative idea
for relieving that some.

00:40:56.740 --> 00:41:00.800
A lot of people in those homes want to pay
something.

00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:03.750
You know, they're determined to hang onto
their home.

00:41:03.750 --> 00:41:06.760
It's their entire net worth in many instances.

00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:09.690
And they're not getting very much help on
that.

00:41:09.690 --> 00:41:14.760
It's that kind of boldness that we need to
hear more of and less about illegal gardeners

00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:17.569
in my judgment.

00:41:17.569 --> 00:41:19.450
&gt;&gt; Stuart: Matt.

00:41:19.450 --> 00:41:22.520
&gt;&gt; Matt: Well, the first thing you said was.

00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:23.520
&gt;&gt;Stuart: Louder.

00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:28.210
&gt;&gt; Matt: The first thing you said was how
World War II was a tremendously important

00:41:28.210 --> 00:41:29.210
event.

00:41:29.210 --> 00:41:33.020
And you, yourself, were to a certain degree
at the forefront of a lot of lionizing that

00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:38.190
went on about 10 years ago, cultural touch
stones like Saving Private Ryan that sort

00:41:38.190 --> 00:41:39.330
of thing.

00:41:39.330 --> 00:41:45.780
Do you feel there's some danger in that we
see now in the era of fourth generation warfare

00:41:45.780 --> 00:41:51.810
where no war going on really properly resembles
World War II that we have a tendency to paint

00:41:51.810 --> 00:41:53.720
things as being World War II.

00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:58.160
That there's -- at least in our political
discourse-- there's this idea that if there's

00:41:58.160 --> 00:42:02.450
ever a question about going to war people
who say no are Neville Chamberlain.

00:42:02.450 --> 00:42:08.790
There's a Hitler, a final boss of this country,
that if he's killed then freedom will prevail.

00:42:08.790 --> 00:42:16.030
And World War II looms so large in our imagination
that it colors how we react now even in places

00:42:16.030 --> 00:42:17.480
where it doesn't fit.

00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:19.990
&gt;&gt; Tom: That's a very important question.

00:42:19.990 --> 00:42:23.020
When political leaders decide to go to war.

00:42:23.020 --> 00:42:25.240
They did in Iraq.

00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:32.520
It kind of triggers a form of nationalism
which everyone wants to be in the parade to

00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:35.420
see the boys and girls go off to war.

00:42:35.420 --> 00:42:37.060
Except people who've gone to war.

00:42:37.060 --> 00:42:40.750
They all have different feelings about those
who've seen combat first hand.

00:42:40.750 --> 00:42:43.280
Especially the military leaders.

00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:48.260
But the military leaders are there to carry
out orders and to offer their best advice.

00:42:48.260 --> 00:42:53.290
When we went to war in Iraq, I had some real
doubts about the long-term possibility for

00:42:53.290 --> 00:42:54.370
it.

00:42:54.370 --> 00:42:55.700
I'd been over there a lot.

00:42:55.700 --> 00:42:58.150
I was inclined to believe he had weapons of
mass destruction.

00:42:58.150 --> 00:42:59.890
I wasn't for sure.

00:42:59.890 --> 00:43:04.290
But I'd been with the UN inspectors they were
led around on merry chases.

00:43:04.290 --> 00:43:05.410
He was a bad guy.

00:43:05.410 --> 00:43:07.260
I could see that.

00:43:07.260 --> 00:43:10.560
Around every corner, when you were in Baghdad
or in the outlying areas, about how people

00:43:10.560 --> 00:43:13.100
lived in utter fear.

00:43:13.100 --> 00:43:17.690
But my long-term concern was that it was going
to be harder than anybody in the administration

00:43:17.690 --> 00:43:19.470
was saying that it would be.

00:43:19.470 --> 00:43:23.390
That it would be more expensive in terms of
blood and treasure.

00:43:23.390 --> 00:43:28.970
And that at the end, Iraq would revert to
kind of tribal governance.

00:43:28.970 --> 00:43:33.640
That it would be the Shiite versus the the
Sunnis; the north versus the south.

00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:38.680
And I knew the country was so broken that
despite these promises of the administration

00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:44.090
that they could finance a lot of the war by
getting oil revenue -- 70 billion dollars

00:43:44.090 --> 00:43:45.760
out of it.

00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:46.940
They haven't been there.

00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:50.040
The intel on the ground was terrible.

00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:51.300
So you're quite right.

00:43:51.300 --> 00:43:54.080
We don't learn the lesson from war to war.

00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:58.180
Vietnam, you would have thought you said you
can't have a war and have guns and butter

00:43:58.180 --> 00:43:59.350
at the same time.

00:43:59.350 --> 00:44:01.300
Just have one piece of it.

00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:07.010
I write in here about Robert McNamara about
how at the end of his life he went around

00:44:07.010 --> 00:44:12.869
and had a kind of a natural confessional about
how we went to war on the wrong terms.

00:44:12.869 --> 00:44:16.930
But the emotion of war often takes over.

00:44:16.930 --> 00:44:21.330
Honestly it's harder to stop a war than it
is to start one.

00:44:21.330 --> 00:44:25.530
And that's the terrible commentary on where
we are.

00:44:25.530 --> 00:44:27.750
&gt;&gt; Matt: Thank you.

00:44:27.750 --> 00:44:30.670
&gt;&gt; Male #3: Thank you so much for coming.

00:44:30.670 --> 00:44:35.590
It's nice to have someone speak who's near
to my age than the average age here.

00:44:35.590 --> 00:44:40.090
[laughter] I was -- I confess I'm a pioneer
boomer.

00:44:40.090 --> 00:44:42.520
I was born in 1948.

00:44:42.520 --> 00:44:46.780
And I further confess from my personal history
that I was a pioneer nerd as well.

00:44:46.780 --> 00:44:52.180
Sir, there's a great deal in your description
that I don't recognize particularly about

00:44:52.180 --> 00:44:54.290
the 1950's upbringing.

00:44:54.290 --> 00:44:59.700
In our household World War II and the depression
particularly the threat of persecution hung

00:44:59.700 --> 00:45:01.530
over us like a paw.

00:45:01.530 --> 00:45:06.660
I also don't recognize a lot you said about
opportunities to be educated.

00:45:06.660 --> 00:45:12.260
I'm fortunate my greatest achievement in this
life is that I raised a son who is now gainfully

00:45:12.260 --> 00:45:14.710
employed in a job with benefits.

00:45:14.710 --> 00:45:19.360
The reason is we taught him to write and we
taught him to negotiate.

00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:25.230
We live in a suburban district, wealthy school
district, high achievement scores that gave

00:45:25.230 --> 00:45:30.100
a totally inadequate education and threw me
off the school board because I wanted to change

00:45:30.100 --> 00:45:31.460
that.

00:45:31.460 --> 00:45:34.340
Where in your description do I hear about
this?

00:45:34.340 --> 00:45:39.560
I think this is the biggest threat to our
country -- the lack of skills in the general

00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:43.030
population -- what can we do?

00:45:43.030 --> 00:45:45.600
We are unwilling as a people to do it.

00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:47.190
How can we change it.

00:45:47.190 --> 00:45:50.830
&gt;&gt; Tom: Well I actually talk a lot about that
in this book.

00:45:50.830 --> 00:45:55.460
The one encouraging part about public education
that I have seen recently is that people are

00:45:55.460 --> 00:45:57.240
beginning to talk about it.

00:45:57.240 --> 00:46:01.650
If I were to give you a quick synopsis it
would be very much what I presume is your

00:46:01.650 --> 00:46:04.470
thinking.

00:46:04.470 --> 00:46:08.369
Those of us who could move to the suburbs
or send our children to private schools and

00:46:08.369 --> 00:46:11.460
we left the inner city to its own devices.

00:46:11.460 --> 00:46:16.570
And it was kind of one size fits all and we
walked away from our moral obligations to

00:46:16.570 --> 00:46:20.980
these schools in the inner city and in the
great urban areas of America.

00:46:20.980 --> 00:46:22.650
That is beginning to change.

00:46:22.650 --> 00:46:25.380
People are now beginning to pay attention
to it.

00:46:25.380 --> 00:46:28.410
New York is certainly imperfect process at
the moment.

00:46:28.410 --> 00:46:33.440
Joel Klein and Mike Bloomberg said we are
not going to allow this to go on the way it

00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:34.440
has.

00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:39.460
There are lots of private enterprises that
are trying to help out.

00:46:39.460 --> 00:46:42.820
I'll just tell you about two in the book that
will be of interest to you.

00:46:42.820 --> 00:46:48.890
There is a very successful commercial real
estate developer in Atlanta by the name Tom

00:46:48.890 --> 00:46:49.890
Cousins.

00:46:49.890 --> 00:46:52.850
I really didn't know him for a long time but
I'd always hear the same thing.

00:46:52.850 --> 00:46:54.340
He's a great man people would say.

00:46:54.340 --> 00:46:56.480
But I'd be skeptical about that.

00:46:56.480 --> 00:46:59.590
So I set out to find out about him.

00:46:59.590 --> 00:47:02.350
He's a third or fourth generation Georgian.

00:47:02.350 --> 00:47:05.550
He developed a new form for commercial real
estate development.

00:47:05.550 --> 00:47:07.930
Made a lot of money.

00:47:07.930 --> 00:47:12.330
But he was always troubled by what was going
on in the inner city and in the African-American

00:47:12.330 --> 00:47:14.020
neighborhoods.

00:47:14.020 --> 00:47:17.820
So he read about a place called East Lake
in Georgia.

00:47:17.820 --> 00:47:21.880
Right outside of Atlanta, southern perimeter
of Atlanta.

00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:26.430
And it was called Little Vietnam because it
was a war zone because of drugs and school

00:47:26.430 --> 00:47:27.430
dropouts.

00:47:27.430 --> 00:47:31.450
Five percent of the kids graduated from high
school in that area.

00:47:31.450 --> 00:47:35.020
It had in the middle of it a historic golf
course called East Lake.

00:47:35.020 --> 00:47:39.300
It's where Bobby Jones, the legendary golfer,
played his first round and last round of golf.

00:47:39.300 --> 00:47:42.560
Tom is a golf aficionado.

00:47:42.560 --> 00:47:46.830
He went down and he had a hard time selling
to his community.

00:47:46.830 --> 00:47:51.220
He said, "I want to start by restoring that
golf course and I can sell big memberships

00:47:51.220 --> 00:47:56.140
and we'll take the money and we'll begin to
change the area."

00:47:56.140 --> 00:48:00.210
To cut to the chase, he did restore the golf
course.

00:48:00.210 --> 00:48:02.780
He took all the money and a lot of his own.

00:48:02.780 --> 00:48:05.020
He built mixed income housing.

00:48:05.020 --> 00:48:10.530
He brought in black middle class families
and working class families, put them there.

00:48:10.530 --> 00:48:16.770
He created a charter school, named it after
a prominent African-American physician by

00:48:16.770 --> 00:48:20.470
the name of Charles R. Drew who did a lot
of work in the blood area.

00:48:20.470 --> 00:48:24.830
Named the school after him and made him the
hero of the school.

00:48:24.830 --> 00:48:27.120
It is now the number 1 school in the state
of Georgia.

00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:30.090
They are now called purpose-built communities.

00:48:30.090 --> 00:48:32.720
Warren Buffet saw a documentary about him
and said, "Sign me up."

00:48:32.720 --> 00:48:35.590
They've done it in Indiana, they're doing
it in Charlotte, they're going to do it in

00:48:35.590 --> 00:48:36.590
Omaha.

00:48:36.590 --> 00:48:38.660
They did a big project in New Orleans.

00:48:38.660 --> 00:48:44.570
There's another school in Cincinnati called
Taft, worst school in the Cincinnati school

00:48:44.570 --> 00:48:46.840
system; one of the worst in Ohio.

00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:49.410
The Cincinnati school district did a very
bold thing.

00:48:49.410 --> 00:48:53.369
They said, "We're going to take down the old
school, in effect.

00:48:53.369 --> 00:48:54.570
We're going to leave the physical building.

00:48:54.570 --> 00:48:57.690
We're going to make it a magnet school for
technology."

00:48:57.690 --> 00:49:00.670
They sent out a very aggressive principal.

00:49:00.670 --> 00:49:05.360
He said to the teachers at lunch, "If you
don't want to work harder than you have been

00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:08.270
and be part of the most successful school
I don't want to see you after lunch."

00:49:08.270 --> 00:49:09.890
Most of them came back.

00:49:09.890 --> 00:49:14.140
He went into the city of Atlanta and talked
to a service club and the man who runs Cincinnati

00:49:14.140 --> 00:49:17.670
Bell, Jack Cassidy, went to him and said,
"I'm your partner."

00:49:17.670 --> 00:49:21.260
And he went out there and put computers in
every classroom.

00:49:21.260 --> 00:49:23.170
He wired the neighborhood for wireless.

00:49:23.170 --> 00:49:26.099
Gave the kids a cell phone number.

00:49:26.099 --> 00:49:28.619
And it's now the number one school in the
state of Ohio.

00:49:28.619 --> 00:49:30.320
A lot of that is going on.

00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:32.410
We just need to connect the dots all over
the place.

00:49:32.410 --> 00:49:34.050
&gt;&gt;Male #3: Yes, there's many--
&gt;&gt;Tom: You're quite right.

00:49:34.050 --> 00:49:39.500
I did a documentary one year in Milwaukee
because Springdale is the name of the suburb,

00:49:39.500 --> 00:49:40.500
I think.

00:49:40.500 --> 00:49:42.599
They got a great school system.

00:49:42.599 --> 00:49:48.580
One block away, you have a bombed out Milwaukee
school system.

00:49:48.580 --> 00:49:49.580
And the

00:49:49.580 --> 00:49:54.700
good folks in the wealthy suburb were providing
some scholarship but never enough.

00:49:54.700 --> 00:49:57.810
We need to break down those barriers, And
make it available to everyone.

00:49:57.810 --> 00:49:59.470
I think there's going to be a lot more choice.

00:49:59.470 --> 00:50:02.520
I think they're going to get more people in
the teaching profession.

00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:07.230
And the business that you're in is going to
make it easier for people to have access on

00:50:07.230 --> 00:50:10.860
a daily basis if they want to home school
or go home and work on things.

00:50:10.860 --> 00:50:13.570
&gt;&gt; Male #3: There's one in Middlesex County
too.

00:50:13.570 --> 00:50:15.110
My son went to.

00:50:15.110 --> 00:50:16.350
It's brilliant.

00:50:16.350 --> 00:50:17.712
We just have to do more of it.

00:50:17.712 --> 00:50:18.930
Thank you very much for coming.

00:50:18.930 --> 00:50:23.690
&gt;&gt; Tom: Well, one of the things I say in my
book my generation if we want to leave any

00:50:23.690 --> 00:50:25.490
kind of a legacy, that is one place to begin.

00:50:25.490 --> 00:50:29.300
We are all beneficiaries of good education
for the most part.

00:50:29.300 --> 00:50:33.400
My wife has a book club in a school in Harlem.

00:50:33.400 --> 00:50:38.260
I've been helping in a school in the south
Bronx, an elementary school, with a wonderfully

00:50:38.260 --> 00:50:41.680
innovative public school administrator.

00:50:41.680 --> 00:50:44.320
So we've been involved in these kinds of things.

00:50:44.320 --> 00:50:47.310
And we all need to find a way to do it.

00:50:47.310 --> 00:50:48.310
Thanks very much.

00:50:48.310 --> 00:50:50.790
&gt;&gt; Stuart: Try to squeeze in a couple more
people.

00:50:50.790 --> 00:50:51.960
But succinct please.

00:50:51.960 --> 00:50:53.130
&gt;&gt; Female: #3: Hi.

00:50:53.130 --> 00:50:58.240
You mention that the fall of communism in
the Soviet Union is one of the greatest moments

00:50:58.240 --> 00:51:02.940
you lived through and that happened in no
small due to America's involvement.

00:51:02.940 --> 00:51:05.780
You also touched briefly on the Arab Spring.

00:51:05.780 --> 00:51:10.510
What do you see as we go forward and we try
to find our way as a country, what is our

00:51:10.510 --> 00:51:17.099
role in the larger global humanity and what
role should we be playing as other countries

00:51:17.099 --> 00:51:19.700
are struggling to find their identity as well.

00:51:19.700 --> 00:51:25.990
&gt;&gt; Tom: Well, I do think a challenge for your
generation, and you are emblematic what's

00:51:25.990 --> 00:51:31.430
possible, is to repair and restore the American
education system.

00:51:31.430 --> 00:51:37.780
Because that's going to be the great leveler
in the future of the global economy is how

00:51:37.780 --> 00:51:39.850
well-educated we are.

00:51:39.850 --> 00:51:44.780
You know, my guess is that most of you have
already traveled physically to different places

00:51:44.780 --> 00:51:45.780
and so on.

00:51:45.780 --> 00:51:53.230
I've got grandchildren who have -- who are
ages 14, 12, 5 and 3.

00:51:53.230 --> 00:51:55.200
All four of them have been to Europe already.

00:51:55.200 --> 00:51:59.640
[chuckles] I didn't get there until I was
28.

00:51:59.640 --> 00:52:01.260
I was just the only one story that comes out
of the book.

00:52:01.260 --> 00:52:05.030
This is the adaptation of my generation to
that generation.

00:52:05.030 --> 00:52:10.140
When my San Francisco granddaughters and I
were in Hawaii, at one point we all -- I took

00:52:10.140 --> 00:52:16.540
them down to the beach, the girls, when they
were 11 and 9 at the time.

00:52:16.540 --> 00:52:17.540
And we were on the beach.

00:52:17.540 --> 00:52:19.431
And we've been out kind of body surfing and
we came back in.

00:52:19.431 --> 00:52:24.060
And I could see the waitress coming down the
beach at the resort hotel where we were.

00:52:24.060 --> 00:52:27.290
And my mind is racing, "how can I order for
the girls?

00:52:27.290 --> 00:52:29.220
what am I gonna order for them?"

00:52:29.220 --> 00:52:35.849
And before I could say anything, the 11-year-old
said to the waitress, "Ma'am, we'd like two

00:52:35.849 --> 00:52:39.360
virgin piña coladas, would you like to join
us Tom?"

00:52:39.360 --> 00:52:43.590
[laughter] I don't have to worry about that
anymore.

00:52:43.590 --> 00:52:46.640
But I do think education is the place to begin.

00:52:46.640 --> 00:52:53.150
And understand the acknowledgment that we're
not colossus America without challenges.

00:52:53.150 --> 00:52:59.790
We're still an enormously powerful country
with the greatest cyber technology in the

00:52:59.790 --> 00:53:05.220
world that was invented here and the greatest
possibilities.

00:53:05.220 --> 00:53:08.230
But we can't take it for granted.

00:53:08.230 --> 00:53:09.540
We have to work at it every day.

00:53:09.540 --> 00:53:13.390
And so, that's why I used the phrase reenlist
as citizens.

00:53:13.390 --> 00:53:19.040
Find something that you care about personally
that will also be greater advantage of this

00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:20.040
country.

00:53:20.040 --> 00:53:22.340
&gt;&gt; Female #4: Hi.

00:53:22.340 --> 00:53:24.200
Thank you so much for coming.

00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:30.480
I watched my grandfather who was a World War
II vet and my dad connect to Walter Cronkite.

00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:36.710
I'm thankful for your time with us because
I started watching you on the Today Show.

00:53:36.710 --> 00:53:38.619
So you were my Walter Cronkite.

00:53:38.619 --> 00:53:45.329
[giggles] And we looked to journalism through
folks like you and Mr. Cronkite as really

00:53:45.329 --> 00:53:47.960
-- yes, being the oxygen for us.

00:53:47.960 --> 00:53:50.140
I feel like there's so much pollution now
in journalism.

00:53:50.140 --> 00:53:52.230
There's not as much oxygen to breathe.

00:53:52.230 --> 00:53:58.650
I feel like much of it is editorialized so
that middle America just gets the opinion

00:53:58.650 --> 00:54:03.270
before they actually hear the news and then
discuss it at the dinner table or at McDonalds

00:54:03.270 --> 00:54:07.180
or via blog or whatever you do now.

00:54:07.180 --> 00:54:11.470
Is there recalibration that needs to happen
with journalism so we keep our government

00:54:11.470 --> 00:54:14.310
leaders to task and everything else.

00:54:14.310 --> 00:54:20.510
&gt;&gt; Tom: I think you need to work harder at
finding straight reportage because opinion

00:54:20.510 --> 00:54:21.680
is the flavor of the moment.

00:54:21.680 --> 00:54:27.060
I mean, even in the New York Times in their
weekend review, now has shifted so that it's

00:54:27.060 --> 00:54:28.160
a lot of opinion.

00:54:28.160 --> 00:54:29.650
But they make it clear.

00:54:29.650 --> 00:54:33.980
I don't have trouble with opinion as long
as it's labeled opinion so that you kind of

00:54:33.980 --> 00:54:38.310
know, "Well, this is somebody who's going
to tell me what he or she thinks."

00:54:38.310 --> 00:54:41.200
And then there are other places you can get
the information.

00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:44.100
But again, it just goes back to what I was
saying originally you just have to work harder

00:54:44.100 --> 00:54:45.100
at it.

00:54:45.100 --> 00:54:48.150
You have to be more proactive as a news consumer.

00:54:48.150 --> 00:54:53.430
And you know on these small screens, there's
a world of possibilities in terms of what

00:54:53.430 --> 00:54:56.410
you can get.

00:54:56.410 --> 00:54:58.770
And that's pretty exciting.

00:54:58.770 --> 00:55:04.150
I also think by the way -- we were talking
about education -- the whole business of online

00:55:04.150 --> 00:55:08.770
education and what's available out there,
what you can access, is just phenomenal.

00:55:08.770 --> 00:55:16.700
I mean, you can stay at home and home school
yourself at my age as it were about what's

00:55:16.700 --> 00:55:18.839
going on in or on any interest that you have.

00:55:18.839 --> 00:55:23.610
Our family has been going to Turkey for the
last couple of years because it's intersession

00:55:23.610 --> 00:55:24.750
between the the east and the west.

00:55:24.750 --> 00:55:30.180
It's a beautiful country and it's got great,
not just Byzantine sites, but ancient Roman

00:55:30.180 --> 00:55:31.619
sites.

00:55:31.619 --> 00:55:37.960
I go online and I get this virtual tour and
read the best archaeologist and find out where

00:55:37.960 --> 00:55:38.960
to go.

00:55:38.960 --> 00:55:41.390
That wasn't available not so long ago.

00:55:41.390 --> 00:55:43.160
&gt;&gt; Stuart: Let me take one last one thank
you.

00:55:43.160 --> 00:55:44.260
&gt;&gt;Tom: Last one?

00:55:44.260 --> 00:55:46.981
OK
&gt;&gt; Male #4: As the gentleman mentioned there's

00:55:46.981 --> 00:55:49.450
a lot of people in this company in their 20s.

00:55:49.450 --> 00:55:50.450
Very young company.

00:55:50.450 --> 00:55:54.980
I was just wondering if you could talk about
what your conversations have been like of

00:55:54.980 --> 00:56:00.740
people of that age right now specifically
your views on the character of our generation

00:56:00.740 --> 00:56:04.920
in the 20s right now and how they compare
to other generations at our age.

00:56:04.920 --> 00:56:07.210
&gt;&gt; Tom: Well, frankly I'm in awe of your generation.

00:56:07.210 --> 00:56:08.990
I mean, you're so smart.

00:56:08.990 --> 00:56:15.640
You know, the cliché about you teach your
parents to drive this new technology.

00:56:15.640 --> 00:56:21.290
But it does not mean there are some things
I think I can kind of alert you to.

00:56:21.290 --> 00:56:25.400
I was at Stanford giving the commencement
address a few years ago.

00:56:25.400 --> 00:56:28.620
My daughter, the Stanford graduate, I saw
her in San Fransisco, she said you better

00:56:28.620 --> 00:56:31.890
read the Stanford Daily, Dad or the Cardinal
as it's called.

00:56:31.890 --> 00:56:38.280
So I read it and they had surveyed the graduating
seniors about what they think of me as a commencement

00:56:38.280 --> 00:56:39.280
speaker.

00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:41.650
[laughter]And one of the young women said,
"Brokaw?

00:56:41.650 --> 00:56:43.910
That's like listening to adult radio."

00:56:43.910 --> 00:56:49.440
[laughter]So she gave her name unfortunately
and I gave her a shout-out when I got to the

00:56:49.440 --> 00:56:50.440
podium.

00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:52.570
I'm not going to tell you who it was now.

00:56:52.570 --> 00:56:59.510
But I said, "Ba Ba Ba, turn your iPod to adult
radio and listen to whatever pleases you.

00:56:59.510 --> 00:57:01.190
I've got something to say to these students."

00:57:01.190 --> 00:57:07.630
And what I said to them is what I said earlier
about not all the answers are in your laptops

00:57:07.630 --> 00:57:10.920
or your PDAs; you have to figure out.

00:57:10.920 --> 00:57:13.660
These are really just tools.

00:57:13.660 --> 00:57:18.840
It's your heart and your mind that will use
them most effectively and that's what you

00:57:18.840 --> 00:57:21.530
have to decide for yourself.

00:57:21.530 --> 00:57:26.260
I was at Stanford recently doing something
else about H 1 B visas about how we can keep

00:57:26.260 --> 00:57:29.940
the best and brightest who come here from
around the world.

00:57:29.940 --> 00:57:34.990
And a law school student, a senior, I was
working in the law school courtyard before

00:57:34.990 --> 00:57:38.760
I went out on my next appointment and this
young man came up to me had I thought a very

00:57:38.760 --> 00:57:39.910
appropriate question.

00:57:39.910 --> 00:57:42.320
It's one I'll leave in the room for the final
question.

00:57:42.320 --> 00:57:48.770
And that is, he said, "Mr. Brokaw, is my generation
going to lose the true meaning of friend?

00:57:48.770 --> 00:57:50.560
What does friend mean?

00:57:50.560 --> 00:57:52.400
Is it a verb?

00:57:52.400 --> 00:57:56.380
Do we have lots of friends just because they
show up on our Facebook?

00:57:56.380 --> 00:58:00.920
Do we use it too casually or should we be
thinking more about the definition of friend?"

00:58:00.920 --> 00:58:03.020
I think it's a really good question.

00:58:03.020 --> 00:58:06.530
Who's a friend and why are they a friend?

00:58:06.530 --> 00:58:11.539
And how do you measure a friend beyond friending
someone on Facebook.

00:58:11.539 --> 00:58:13.869
&gt;&gt; Stuart: Thank you very much Tom.

00:58:13.869 --> 00:58:16.869
[applause]
&gt;&gt; Tom: Thank you.

00:58:16.869 --> 00:58:17.869
[Applause].

00:58:17.869 --> 00:58:27.260
&gt;&gt; Tom: Let me just end with one Google story
because I've actually been.

00:58:27.260 --> 00:58:33.690
like everyone else, I've been fascinated by
your business and your company since the beginning

00:58:33.690 --> 00:58:35.460
of it and I've gotten to know it pretty well.

00:58:35.460 --> 00:58:40.950
I've been on the campus in California a couple
of times and then I went to the Google zeitgeist

00:58:40.950 --> 00:58:47.540
conference in -- when they had the first one
I think in Palo Alto as I remember.

00:58:47.540 --> 00:58:50.290
And they asked me -- I guess I can say this.

00:58:50.290 --> 00:58:52.780
This is going to get streamed at some point,
right?

00:58:52.780 --> 00:58:54.790
[laughter] I got to tell you this story.

00:58:54.790 --> 00:58:56.050
It's already been out there.

00:58:56.050 --> 00:58:58.880
Eric Schmidt asked me to do something.

00:58:58.880 --> 00:58:59.880
He asked me to come and speak.

00:58:59.880 --> 00:59:02.750
He said I'm going to have your friend Yvan
Chouinard come as well.

00:59:02.750 --> 00:59:06.400
Yvan Chouinard is a man who founded Patagonia
-- that company.

00:59:06.400 --> 00:59:09.000
He's one of the great great environmentalists
of our time.

00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:12.370
And one of the most inventive people that
anybody ever will know.

00:59:12.370 --> 00:59:13.770
He reinvented all the climbing equipment.

00:59:13.770 --> 00:59:16.589
But he's a Luddite when it comes to technology.

00:59:16.589 --> 00:59:21.270
He just doesn't -- he thinks that man was
given hands as tools and we ought not to lose

00:59:21.270 --> 00:59:24.119
the opportunity to use those tools.

00:59:24.119 --> 00:59:26.560
and I said, "well, you don't want Yvan to
talk.

00:59:26.560 --> 00:59:28.360
He's not very good at speaking.

00:59:28.360 --> 00:59:30.170
Why don't I interview him?"

00:59:30.170 --> 00:59:31.670
That's a great idea.

00:59:31.670 --> 00:59:36.640
So we waited till the morning was over and
they had a lot of highbrow stuff about the

00:59:36.640 --> 00:59:39.690
philosophy of the Internet.

00:59:39.690 --> 00:59:45.099
John Chambers from Cisco was there talking
about the global routing questions that are

00:59:45.099 --> 00:59:46.099
going to be involved.

00:59:46.099 --> 00:59:48.880
And so, I went out with Yvan after this.

00:59:48.880 --> 00:59:51.550
He's about 5 foot 2, or 3.

00:59:51.550 --> 00:59:53.119
He's one of my very closest friends.

00:59:53.119 --> 00:59:56.440
And he's had just a phenomenal life.

00:59:56.440 --> 01:00:00.420
More first routes in Yosemite And everywhere
in North America than anybody else.

01:00:00.420 --> 01:00:02.180
Climbed all over the world.

01:00:02.180 --> 01:00:05.020
Built this company from nothing.

01:00:05.020 --> 01:00:06.680
And we sat down.

01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:09.320
And I said, "I think most of you know who
Yvan Chouinard is."

01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:11.790
There was a lot of nodding.

01:00:11.790 --> 01:00:13.980
"so we'll begin with basic questions."

01:00:13.980 --> 01:00:16.450
Yvan, do you have a cell phone?

01:00:16.450 --> 01:00:17.500
He said no.

01:00:17.500 --> 01:00:21.940
And I said "do you have Blackberry or a smart
phone"?

01:00:21.940 --> 01:00:24.560
"What's a Blackberry?"

01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:26.900
[laughter] I held one up and he said, "why
would I have one of those?"

01:00:26.900 --> 01:00:29.670
I said "well, you have a company that has
a lot of online business.

01:00:29.670 --> 01:00:30.670
You have a lot of stores."

01:00:30.670 --> 01:00:37.560
And he said, "yeah, but when I want to talk
to my manager, I go in and see him or I call

01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:39.580
him on a regular phone.

01:00:39.580 --> 01:00:41.320
But they don't need me pestering him.

01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:42.610
I don't need one of those things.

01:00:42.610 --> 01:00:45.330
I don't need for people to know where I am
all the time.

01:00:45.330 --> 01:00:46.750
I don't want to be a part of that."

01:00:46.750 --> 01:00:50.070
Then he went into -- he said to the audience.

01:00:50.070 --> 01:00:51.500
We were given these hands as tools.

01:00:51.500 --> 01:00:57.461
He said, "I started my business, in effect,
as a teenager fixing old cars.

01:00:57.461 --> 01:01:04.970
1938 cars taking apart, building them back
again; rappelling off cliffs to do falconry.

01:01:04.970 --> 01:01:11.220
My hands allowed me to do that and I strengthened
my legs and I learned how to climb vertically.

01:01:11.220 --> 01:01:17.840
I was in a ice cave for ten days in Monte
Fitz Roy in Chile.

01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:20.250
And I had a lot of time to think.

01:01:20.250 --> 01:01:22.359
Because I had no other devices to distract
me.

01:01:22.359 --> 01:01:25.260
That's where I got the idea for the company
that I now run.

01:01:25.260 --> 01:01:29.830
I needed better clothing that would last."

01:01:29.830 --> 01:01:38.140
Then I said to him, "but Yvan, in your passion,
climbing, cyber technology has now moved in.

01:01:38.140 --> 01:01:43.150
People are now taking their laptops with them
when they go to Himalayas or when they go

01:01:43.150 --> 01:01:44.150
to climb somewhere."

01:01:44.150 --> 01:01:47.490
You could just see the energy drain out of
him.

01:01:47.490 --> 01:01:53.130
And he said, "Yeah, there are probably some
of you in this room who have done this.

01:01:53.130 --> 01:01:57.970
You've hired an outfitter for 50,000 dollars
in the Himalayas.

01:01:57.970 --> 01:02:01.130
You picked out a peak that you're going to
go climb.

01:02:01.130 --> 01:02:03.150
You got your little espresso machine.

01:02:03.150 --> 01:02:05.520
You've gotten your laptop.

01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:08.240
You've gotten yourself, bought a lot of Patagonia
gear.

01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:09.240
We're thankful for that.

01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:10.840
You got yourself all dressed up.

01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:15.950
And then you fly to the Himalayas and your
guide and outfitter meets you and the sherpas

01:02:15.950 --> 01:02:19.480
carry all your stuff up to base camp so you
don't have to carry anything.

01:02:19.480 --> 01:02:23.321
And you get there and you get a little satellite
dish and you go online and you say to your

01:02:23.321 --> 01:02:28.470
wife and family, "I'm here it's going to be
the greatest adventure of my life."

01:02:28.470 --> 01:02:34.349
And the morning you're supposed to summit,
the guide wakes you up fixes your breakfast

01:02:34.349 --> 01:02:40.150
and then one ropes up in front of you and
one is behind you to get you up to the summit

01:02:40.150 --> 01:02:41.820
and get you back.

01:02:41.820 --> 01:02:46.369
And then you come back to base camp and you
write to your friends and family, 'I summited

01:02:46.369 --> 01:02:47.369
today.

01:02:47.369 --> 01:02:50.130
I have one of the great achievements of my
lifetime'."

01:02:50.130 --> 01:02:51.620
He looked out on the audience.

01:02:51.620 --> 01:02:56.920
"I don't know how else to tell you this except,
you're an asshole when you left and an asshole

01:02:56.920 --> 01:02:59.109
when you got back."

01:02:59.109 --> 01:03:02.849
[laughter] It went totally viral on the Internet.

01:03:02.849 --> 01:03:05.900
And he got a standing ovation from the room.

01:03:05.900 --> 01:03:07.030
So I saw it.

01:03:07.030 --> 01:03:09.650
We got to keep that perspective in there as
well.

01:03:09.650 --> 01:03:10.680
Thank you all very much.

01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:10.890
[Applause]
