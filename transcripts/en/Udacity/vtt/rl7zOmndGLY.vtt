In this problem, here at Udacity we're trying to upload our videos to YouTube,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
but we're having a hard time because it's taking a really long time

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
to upload these multi-gigabyte files.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
What do we need to do to fix this problem?

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
First let's consider latency.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Latency is the time it takes something to go from Udacity to YouTube.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Well, if we consider the fact that the video is being broken up into smaller chunks,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
the amount of time it takes to send 1 chunk over

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
is probably going to be on the order of something like 100 milliseconds.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Even if we reduce this to 1 millisecond,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
sending only 1 chunk at a time, considering there are 3 gigabytes worth of data,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
is going to go almost just as slow.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
We might save 99 milliseconds.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
In the grand scheme of things, this isn't really going to fix the problem.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Next let's consider bandwidth.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
If instead we increase the bandwidth of our connection,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
which allows us to send larger chunks over from our source to our destination,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
we really solve the problem.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Here the latency isn't a big issue compared to the size of the files we're sending,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
and it's much more important to send larger chunks over

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
than measuring the time it takes a single chunk to go from Udacity to YouTube.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
So the answer is we want to increase the bandwidth.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
The last 2 options were based on the content of the video:

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
the number of colors we have and how much bad hair we have in the video itself.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
While these may affect the file size a bit, it doesn't make that much of a difference.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
And really, the best way to fix this problem is by increasing our bandwidth.
