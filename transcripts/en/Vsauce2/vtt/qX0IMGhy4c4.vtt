00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.970
Researchers from Georgia Tech are developing
warm skin for robots.

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:10.639
The active thermal sensing combines with traditional
force sensing to allow the robot to touch-identify

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:14.299
wood and aluminum with 96% accuracy.

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:20.670
And the acorn worm, one of our closet invertebrate
relatives can regrow every major body part

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.160
including its nervous system, internal organs
and its head.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.930
And humans may share all of the genes they
use to do this.

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:28.930
Vsauce!

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:35.190
Kevin here - this is Mind Blow.

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.460
Digital capture of eyeballs is now a whole
lot easier.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.280
Disney Research Zurich has developed a parametric
model that allows quicker, less-intrusive

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.560
reconstruction of eyes.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:50.329
Using a database of pre-captured eyes a single
photo from the internet is all that's needed

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:55.520
to create the digital eyes and the system
also includes artistic control over parameters

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.780
like vein depth and thickness, iris geometry,
and pupil dilation.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.450
The fitting technique algorithm works so well
it can even recreate digital versions of eyeball

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.940
from paintings.

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:09.750
So yeah.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.410
Spiderwort grew an ear on an apple.

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:17.820
The company is developing an open source CO2
incubator as well as cellulose biomaterials

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.720
to grow cells in your house.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.720
Basically, scaffolds for growing cells typically
come from animal or human tissue but they’re

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.040
developing cell wall architectures from the
plants and fungus kingdoms.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.570
The system is in the pre-sale stage right
now and the hope is to allow low cost and

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:39.740
open source DIY kits for schools, labs and
garages.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.090
Scientists at Harvard have invented a cigarette-smoking
robot.

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.920
The machine lights and then essentially inhales
and exhales the smoke from up to 10 cigarettes

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:49.970
at a time.

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:55.510
A tiny chip inside covered with living cells
from human lungs is then used to analyze the

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:56.510
effects.

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:01.350
They also have a 3D-printed heart-on-a-chip
device and the plan is to eventually create

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:08.140
an entire human-on-a-chip to link 10 organ-chips
together and study the entire human body.

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:13.780
Living organisms have been persuaded to make
chemical bonds not found in nature.

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.850
Researchers at Caltech are breeding molecules
with silicon-carbon compounds - something

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.840
only chemists could previously accomplish.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:28.120
Synthetically created organosilicon compounds
are currently used in pharmaceuticals, semiconductors,

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.810
and also computer and TV screens.

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:36.290
And this new bonding method called directed
evolution is nontoxic, cheaper, more efficient

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.570
and easier to modify than chemical synthesis.

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.430
And this is more about reducing the need for
precious metals in making scilicon-carbon

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.520
bonds than it is about creating androids.

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:47.760
For now.

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.860
Two paralyzed monkeys can walk again thanks
to a brain-spine interface.

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.970
Neuroengieers at Brown University recorded
the electrical signals from the movement-controlling

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:03.990
area of the monkey’s brains, then decoded
and sent them to implanted electrodes on the

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.990
spine.

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:10.010
The signals stimulated the spinal cord and
the monkeys not only walked but reacted naturally

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:11.770
to the regained motion.

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:15.720
And they’re working on improving the hardware
with the hope it can someday be used to aid

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.570
paraplegic humans.

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:21.630
suitX is augmenting the power of human bodies.

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:26.790
The flexible exoskeletons are designed to
reduce injury and bolster productivity by

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.400
providing assistance lifting, squatting and
bending.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.780
Three models backX, shoulderX and legX can
reduce muscle force up to 50%.

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:40.930
They’re currently aimed at helping construction
and factory workers but they also have the

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:46.209
Phoenix which is the world’s lightest exoskeleton
to help those with mobility disorders.

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:50.819
A new magnetic ink prints self-healing devices.

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:55.601
Microparticles organized by a magnetic field
become attracted to one in the event of a

00:03:55.601 --> 00:03:58.980
tear - allowing the device to heal itself.

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:04.910
The repair can occur with a tear up to 3 millimeters
which is a record in self-healing systems

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:09.970
and the magnetic ink could be used to create
self-healing batteries and wearable electrical

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:10.970
circuits.

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:15.430
Finally, researchers from Northwestern University
have developed a wearable skin sensor to measure

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.480
the composition of your sweat.

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.450
I am a skin-like microfluidic device please
scan for biomarker information.

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.030
So it launches an app.

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:28.180
It provides that voice recognition that there's
a connection here.

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:33.210
And then the phone takes a picture of the
device and from analysis of the colors of

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:38.400
these different reservoirs that are filled
with these color-responsive chemical reagents,

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.820
we can determine quantitatively the glucose
level, the pH the lactate concentration, the

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:47.690
chloride concentration as well as the total
sweat loss during a given period of exercise.

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:52.590
I’m gonna leave you with a non-anthropomorphic
walking robot which means it doesn't walk

00:04:52.590 --> 00:05:08.210
like this, it walks like, you'll see, and
as always - thanks for watching.

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:23.290
In the operating room the first light of its
kind is installed no portion of an operation

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:24.290
is ever in shadow.

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:28.980
Nor is the expectant father forgotten here
he can get the news officially and suffer

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:31.280
under the most comfortable circumstances possible.

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:36.410
And for mother, well she is only to call for
her baby and baby comes sliding through a

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:40.060
wall in a drawer-like basinet for a little
visit with the new mother.

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:44.480
In this two million dollar institution doors
are opened by remote control on the single

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:47.830
floor patients are easily moved from place
to place.

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:56.490
Dreams grounds for a dream hospital.
