In addition to thinking
about the major themes and

00:00:02.466 --> 00:00:05.681
keywords to include in your targeted
resume, it is helpful to think about how

00:00:05.681 --> 00:00:09.690
to structure your profession narratives
so that it tells an interesting story.

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:10.691
How can you do this?

00:00:10.691 --> 00:00:14.090
By strategically ordering
the sections of your resume.

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:16.990
In the Master Resume section we
examined the various sections

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:18.920
your Master Resume should include.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.570
In your targeted resume,
order these in an engaging and

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.560
meaningful way that is
appropriate to your background.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.660
This is because the order of your
resume sections helps provide logical

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.670
evidence of your experience.

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.900
Whether you're just starting your
career, or making a career change, or

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.650
have many years of experience
within a single industry,

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.020
your resume will look
slightly different.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.203
In the next section you'll see
some common resume structures.

00:00:41.203 --> 00:00:44.000
Based on this information,
fill out your targeted resume and

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.250
see which order communicates your
goals and experience most clearly.
