TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hi everyone
I'm Timothy Jordan,

00:00:02.108 --> 00:00:04.080
and I'm standing here
with Ariana Mott.

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.250
She is a software
engineer on Daydream.

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:07.800
Hi, Ariana.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:08.730
ARIANA MOTT: Hi Timothy.

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:09.700
TIMOTHY JORDAN: How
are you doing today?

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:10.840
ARIANA MOTT: I'm doing great.

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.310
TIMOTHY JORDAN: I mean, how
can you not be doing great?

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:14.810
We're in Florida and we're at
the Grace Hopper conference.

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:17.500
ARIANA MOTT: Yeah, it's been
super fun meeting tons of women

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:18.750
we're really interested in VR.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.379
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So you gave
a presentation on Daydream--

00:00:21.379 --> 00:00:22.170
ARIANA MOTT: Well--

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.900
TIMOTHY JORDAN: More about VR
development in general, right?

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.990
And things that developers
should consider, both sort

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.000
of technical and a
little less technical

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.090
about making a great
experience for people in VR.

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.270
And I don't think we have
the time or the slide deck

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.520
to get through all of them,
but I was hoping maybe you

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.680
could tell us, what's
something that you

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.440
didn't expect when you started
working on VR about building

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.204
an experience for people?

00:00:46.204 --> 00:00:48.120
ARIANA MOTT: I think
something I didn't expect

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.180
was that there was no one to one
relationship of something that

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.870
will definitely work in VR--
whether that be technical,

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.690
in terms of how someone's
body will physically respond

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.359
to something, or
emotional comfort

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.400
or psychological comfort,
in terms of what people

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.370
are comfortable with in VR.

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.380
We talked about a lot
of the exploratory stuff

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.900
we've done to figure out
what types of things do work

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.450
and what kind of
things we should avoid.

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.160
TIMOTHY JORDAN: I imagine
that there is a fair amount--

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.770
based on what you're saying--

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.230
of, we think this will work.

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:21.901
Let's try it.

00:01:21.901 --> 00:01:22.650
ARIANA MOTT: Yeah.

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.066
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
You just, kind of,

00:01:24.066 --> 00:01:26.190
have to get that
headset on and see if it

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:27.350
works the way you intended.

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:28.100
ARIANA MOTT: Yeah.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.770
One of the most important things
is definitely testing VR in VR.

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.130
Something that would
work in 2-D does not

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.720
work necessarily in VR.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.060
And something that
works on a 6 DoF headset

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.306
doesn't necessarily
work on a 3 DoF headset.

00:01:41.306 --> 00:01:42.930
So it's really
important to test it out

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.130
on the different
types of hardware

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.230
that we were working on.

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:46.170
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So
for those people

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.974
watching that weren't able to
attend your session in person,

00:01:48.974 --> 00:01:50.640
is there anything
else you can tell them

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.800
about getting started
in VR development?

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:53.550
ARIANA MOTT: Yeah.

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.580
We have a developer site for
Cardboard and for Daydream,

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.710
and those are great
ways to get started.

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.840
And we have the SDK, and we have
a bunch of tutorials and apps

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.180
that get people started--
either with native code

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.770
or with Unity's samples.

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.949
And just, the best way to
do it is grab a tutorial app

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:12.540
and just start
moving things around.

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.760
And see how things you react
to different things in VR.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:17.760
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Awesome.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.890
Thank you so much for
hanging out with me today,

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.230
and everybody out there, Ariana.

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.280
ARIANA MOTT: Thank you
for having me, Timothy.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.750
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
Thanks for tuning

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.416
into one of our
developers show segments

00:02:26.416 --> 00:02:27.750
from somewhere in the world.

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.160
