about the states the fundamental thing
that the Indian states need to do is

that the Indian states need to do is
 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.209
that the Indian states need to do is

that they need to have their own agenda
 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:15.650
that they need to have their own agenda
in terms of what growth they should do

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660
in terms of what growth they should do
 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:16.939
in terms of what growth they should do
what kind of industries they should

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949
what kind of industries they should
 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.250
what kind of industries they should
focus on there has to be a clear-cut

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260
focus on there has to be a clear-cut
 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.050
focus on there has to be a clear-cut
positioning that each state needs to

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060
positioning that each state needs to
 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.359
positioning that each state needs to
take up right now what we see in it see

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369
take up right now what we see in it see
 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.400
take up right now what we see in it see
in India is that India is growing at

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410
in India is that India is growing at
 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.990
in India is that India is growing at
about nine percent or eight percent

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000
about nine percent or eight percent
 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.179
about nine percent or eight percent
whatever we might say but this about ten

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189
whatever we might say but this about ten
 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.800
whatever we might say but this about ten
states which are growing at a rate which

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810
states which are growing at a rate which
 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.590
states which are growing at a rate which
is higher than the way India's growing

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600
is higher than the way India's growing
 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.479
is higher than the way India's growing
so that means there is certain dichotomy

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489
so that means there is certain dichotomy
 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:36.590
so that means there is certain dichotomy
in the way the growth is actually

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600
in the way the growth is actually
 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.970
in the way the growth is actually
happening there is a whole huge level of

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980
happening there is a whole huge level of
 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.430
happening there is a whole huge level of
disparity in the growth of states and if

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440
disparity in the growth of states and if
 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.560
disparity in the growth of states and if
you really see what these states need to

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570
you really see what these states need to
 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.150
you really see what these states need to
do is that they really need to define

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160
do is that they really need to define
 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.119
do is that they really need to define
then what genders they are really going

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129
then what genders they are really going
 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.709
then what genders they are really going
to follow if they do not do that they're

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719
to follow if they do not do that they're
 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.600
to follow if they do not do that they're
actually going to get lagging behind the

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610
actually going to get lagging behind the
 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.490
actually going to get lagging behind the
second thing that we really need to

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500
second thing that we really need to
 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.470
second thing that we really need to
understand and look at is something on

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480
understand and look at is something on
 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.750
understand and look at is something on
urbanization how the organization will

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760
urbanization how the organization will
 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.459
urbanization how the organization will
happen what kind of cities are really

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469
happen what kind of cities are really
 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.139
happen what kind of cities are really
going to come up right now we are just

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149
going to come up right now we are just
 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.630
going to come up right now we are just
too focused on certain set of city said

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640
too focused on certain set of city said
 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.549
too focused on certain set of city said
Delhi Bombay or what we might follow the

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559
Delhi Bombay or what we might follow the
 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.280
Delhi Bombay or what we might follow the
tier 1 cities the growth in the country

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290
tier 1 cities the growth in the country
 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.539
tier 1 cities the growth in the country
is not really going to happen from these

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549
is not really going to happen from these
 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:09.679
is not really going to happen from these
cities it's actually going to be about

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689
cities it's actually going to be about
 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.120
cities it's actually going to be about
the alternate cities that are really

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130
the alternate cities that are really
 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.100
the alternate cities that are really
going to be coming up so if you really

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110
going to be coming up so if you really
 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.810
going to be coming up so if you really
look at a state like Maharashtra you

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820
look at a state like Maharashtra you
 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.280
look at a state like Maharashtra you
would notice that about the six to eight

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290
would notice that about the six to eight
 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.990
would notice that about the six to eight
urban centers contributed about ninety

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000
urban centers contributed about ninety
 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.429
urban centers contributed about ninety
percent of the gdp to the state of

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439
percent of the gdp to the state of
 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:20.929
percent of the gdp to the state of
Maharashtra and let the true story

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939
Maharashtra and let the true story
 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.880
Maharashtra and let the true story
across the board so the urban areas are

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890
across the board so the urban areas are
 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.160
across the board so the urban areas are
really going to create a lot of

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170
really going to create a lot of
 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.539
really going to create a lot of
opportunities but we need to go for

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549
opportunities but we need to go for
 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:27.890
opportunities but we need to go for
right urbanization and that's going to

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900
right urbanization and that's going to
 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.510
right urbanization and that's going to
be very important for competitiveness of

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520
be very important for competitiveness of
 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.359
be very important for competitiveness of
the country I think what's happening

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369
the country I think what's happening
 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.950
the country I think what's happening
right now is that we growth that we're

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960
right now is that we growth that we're
 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.630
right now is that we growth that we're
seeing in the urban areas is actually

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640
seeing in the urban areas is actually
 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.270
seeing in the urban areas is actually
fairly not very well planned and so on

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280
fairly not very well planned and so on
 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.440
fairly not very well planned and so on
and so forth so there are going to be

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450
and so forth so there are going to be
 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.210
and so forth so there are going to be
certain level of delamination factors

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220
certain level of delamination factors
 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.859
certain level of delamination factors
that are really going to be coming in in

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869
that are really going to be coming in in
 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.649
that are really going to be coming in in
fact if you really talk about the cities

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659
fact if you really talk about the cities
 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.120
fact if you really talk about the cities
that we're seeing which are going to

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130
that we're seeing which are going to
 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.380
that we're seeing which are going to
emerge they're going to be like say Unga

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390
emerge they're going to be like say Unga
 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.060
emerge they're going to be like say Unga
bod which is going to be an alternate

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070
bod which is going to be an alternate
 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.160
bod which is going to be an alternate
city a place like gold on is going to go

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170
city a place like gold on is going to go
 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.300
city a place like gold on is going to go
down Bangalore is going to go down

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310
down Bangalore is going to go down
 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.010
down Bangalore is going to go down
because the denomination factors have

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020
because the denomination factors have
 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.770
because the denomination factors have
already set in so each city should look

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780
already set in so each city should look
 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.840
already set in so each city should look
at the larger point is that each city

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850
at the larger point is that each city
 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.160
at the larger point is that each city
and state should develop its own

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170
and state should develop its own
 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.560
and state should develop its own
economic agenda its own positioning and

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570
economic agenda its own positioning and
 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.630
economic agenda its own positioning and
then focus on it in fact that the larger

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640
then focus on it in fact that the larger
 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.310
then focus on it in fact that the larger
thing would be that each state should

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320
thing would be that each state should
 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.180
thing would be that each state should
actually look at the top three

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190
actually look at the top three
 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.710
actually look at the top three
industries that they should be focusing

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720
industries that they should be focusing
 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.480
industries that they should be focusing
on today's states are not completing

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490
on today's states are not completing
 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:12.620
on today's states are not completing
just within states in India they're

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630
just within states in India they're
 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.030
just within states in India they're
going to be competing with it with

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040
going to be competing with it with
 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.000
going to be competing with it with
different locations across the world and

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010
different locations across the world and
 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.190
different locations across the world and
if you do not get it right the states

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200
if you do not get it right the states
 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.540
if you do not get it right the states
are actually going to lose it so I think

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550
are actually going to lose it so I think
 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.210
are actually going to lose it so I think
the primary thing for the Chief Minister

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220
the primary thing for the Chief Minister
 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.350
the primary thing for the Chief Minister
is going to be actually to get the

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360
is going to be actually to get the
 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.660
is going to be actually to get the
fiscal policy right to get their growth
