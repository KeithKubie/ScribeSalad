00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.500
Here's a story that is reported by Kernighan and Pike

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.800
in their book, "The Practice of Programming."

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:11.000
One university computer center kept a teddy bear near the help desk.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Students with mysterious bugs were required to explain the problems to the bear

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
before they could speak to a human counselor.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Picture that--speak to a bear, and in two thirds of all cases,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
the problem would resolve itself.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
That's how effective explicit debugging is.
