[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:06.880
ALAN: Hey, I'm Alan.

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.770
Welcome to another
Talks at Google event.

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:11.920
We are here on stage with Melody
Yang from the "Gazillion Bubble

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.750
Show."

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:15.340
I just want to
dive right in here

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.670
and start talking about
the family history.

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:23.520
We were talking a second ago,
this is the Yang family show.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.360
Get into family history,
tell me like how

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:26.800
you got here in New York.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.290
MELODY YANG: Well, I mean,
it pretty much started

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:32.439
from my father and
his imagination.

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.980
When he was young, he was
always fascinated with bubbles

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.430
because one of his dad's friends
brought over a bubble toy.

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.060
And then, my dad, as he
grew up, he started--

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.360
my dad was very poor at the
time, and so he was working.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.880
He was doing a lot of
street performances,

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:53.740
and so once he got
older, around 16, 17,

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:57.220
he started traveling around
Europe with my uncle.

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.769
And they were doing like
juggling acts, magic acts.

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:01.060
ALAN: So it wasn't bubbles yet.

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:02.518
MELODY YANG: It
wasn't bubbles yet,

00:01:02.518 --> 00:01:05.330
but bubbles was always
in the back of his mind.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.010
So he always was testing
different formulas

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.430
and trying to test out
different soaps and detergents

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.870
and whatever to find out a
formula where he can create,

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:21.010
you know, bubbles that are large
enough to do so many things,

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.380
to manipulate a lot better.

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:29.460
And then after that, yeah,
he came up with a performance

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.340
just with bubbles.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.140
And it started off as like a
10-minute performance, and him

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.270
and my mom when they
met-- also my mom met him

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.580
when she was quite
young, and they

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.500
started to perform together.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.510
And then they were
traveling on cruise ships.

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:46.290
They would do
street performances.

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.130
They'd work in nightclubs
and all over the place, all

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.930
over Europe first.

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.370
And then, once my brother
and myself were born,

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.870
my dad's like, hey, why don't
we just let them try it?

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:58.740
You know?

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.110
And so for us, it was
all fun and games.

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.240
It was play, and then he started
putting us into competitions

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.030
and talent shows.

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.697
ALAN: And how old were
you at this point?

00:02:08.697 --> 00:02:10.530
MELODY YANG: I would
say I started at three.

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:16.200
I always say four, but three,
that's when I got on stage.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.820
So four is when I
actually started,

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:22.220
I was able to create
tricks with my brother.

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.840
But three, I was
just put in a bubble.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.520
Like I was the one
that walked on stage

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.460
and my brother would just
put me inside a bubble.

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.350
But that's when
me and my brother

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.622
started to perform pretty
much, and then from there,

00:02:34.622 --> 00:02:36.330
we just started learning
different tricks

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.330
and it just grew more
and more over time.

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:40.536
You know?

00:02:40.536 --> 00:02:42.450
ALAN: So you've
been here on stage--

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.589
or I guess, have you been
on this stage for 12 years?

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:47.130
You've been in New
York for 12 years.

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.171
MELODY YANG: We've been
in New York for 12 years.

00:02:49.171 --> 00:02:52.580
I've only been here,
what, like seven years?

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:53.860
So seven, eight years, yeah.

00:02:54.684 --> 00:02:56.350
ALAN: Your father
brought the show here?

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.225
MELODY YANG: My father
brought the show here.

00:02:58.225 --> 00:03:00.100
So this full
production, it actually

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:05.260
was built in Korea at
the time, way before.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.430
And then someone wanted to
bring the show here to New York.

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.020
I forgot who it was.

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:12.700
I was so young then.

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.500
So my dad wanted to test it out
and he brought the show here,

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.810
and we were only supposed
to run for about two weeks.

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.900
Now we've been running
here for about 12 years,

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.060
so it's been pretty good.

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.930
Pretty grateful.

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.885
ALAN: So now, obviously,
time has gone by.

00:03:28.885 --> 00:03:31.260
You've been doing this-- how
long did you say, six years?

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.070
MELODY YANG: Here in New York,
yeah, about six, seven years.

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:35.680
ALAN: Do you have a title?

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.487
Do you call yourself like
the bubble connoisseur?

00:03:38.487 --> 00:03:39.570
What do you call yourself?

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:43.690
MELODY YANG: I mean, I get
so many different names.

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.580
I get like bubble princess,
bubble queen, you know,

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.940
bubble master, but I would say
my dad's the bubble master.

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.585
I don't know, I just call
myself a bubble artist.

00:03:53.585 --> 00:03:55.480
ALAN: I like that,
so you prefer artist?

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.440
MELODY YANG: Yeah,
artist is nice.

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.510
ALAN: So are there still
five people who perform?

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.850
I was looking on the website.

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:04.440
So I guess, who
still comes on stage?

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:05.273
Who rotates through?

00:04:05.273 --> 00:04:06.900
MELODY YANG: We all perform.

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.870
So sometimes, we'll
have shows overseas.

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.110
Like my brother right now,
he's working in Orlando.

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:19.370
And my father, he's trying
to work into the theme park

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.880
business right now, so he's
working on something in Asia

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.050
with that stuff.

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.720
And my mother, she
kind of rotates with me

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.070
sometimes here and there.

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:29.792
She's like, oh, I'm
getting a little old,

00:04:29.792 --> 00:04:31.000
I don't want to work anymore.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.300
I'm like, mom, come on.

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:33.425
Like, you still look great.

00:04:33.425 --> 00:04:34.640
You're fine.

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:35.670
And my uncle too.

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:37.740
So my uncle, he
just did the show,

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.005
he did a tour in China,
so that's interesting.

00:04:41.005 --> 00:04:44.130
ALAN: So you guys have
basically franchised this out

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.690
to the family more or less?

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:48.670
I want to touch on
the world records.

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:49.990
You have 18?

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:51.270
The family has 18?

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:52.680
MELODY YANG: It's like mixed.

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:58.510
Some is my dad, some is my mom,
some is all of us together.

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:01.255
I only have three,
but it was broken.

00:05:01.255 --> 00:05:02.380
ALAN: Know how many I have?

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:02.880
Zero.

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.840
MELODY YANG: OK,
I know, but still.

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.540
I mean, compared to my dad,
he just keeps breaking them

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:09.580
or he keeps inventing new ones.

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:10.470
You know?

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:13.240
So the ones that I have
are the most people

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:17.260
inside a bubble and the
world's largest bubble.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.776
ALAN: So, the world's
largest bubble.

00:05:19.776 --> 00:05:21.400
How big was the
world's largest bubble?

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.030
MELODY YANG: That
was 170 feet long.

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:25.600
ALAN: Wow.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.430
And then you've
also got, I mean,

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:29.320
the family, between
all of you, you have--

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.570
elephant in a bubble
was one of my favorites.

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:32.980
MELODY YANG: My dad did that.

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:36.720
He did an elephant in a
bubble and PETA went crazy,

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.300
but the elephant
loved it, you know.

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.390
Like after my dad, he
changed the location,

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:45.560
he put the elephant
inside a bubble.

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.180
The elephant loved it and the
other elephants were coming.

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:49.888
They were trying to
like pop the bubbles.

00:05:49.888 --> 00:05:51.322
Like they were
having a good time.

00:05:51.322 --> 00:05:52.030
Nothing happened.

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:54.629
ALAN: So no elephants harmed
in the making of that record?

00:05:54.629 --> 00:05:56.670
MELODY YANG: No, they were
actually really happy.

00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:00.360
ALAN: So for the whole
family, the collection,

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.404
what's the record that
you're most proud of?

00:06:03.404 --> 00:06:06.899
MELODY YANG: I would
say now, I would still

00:06:06.899 --> 00:06:08.190
say the world's largest bubble.

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:11.050
ALAN: Not the
longest bubble wall?

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:13.180
MELODY YANG: Well
that is the one, yeah,

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:17.800
because we created it as a wall
instead of one huge bubble.

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.530
ALAN: How many people did
you have inside the most

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:21.620
people record bubble?

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:24.850
MELODY YANG: You know, we
actually had 200 people,

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:29.110
but they didn't count certain
people because they were kids.

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:31.120
So you have to be
like a certain height,

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:35.250
so that turned out
to be 181 people.

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:36.250
ALAN: That's ridiculous.

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:38.655
MELODY YANG: I know,
but hey, I'll take it.

00:06:38.655 --> 00:06:40.030
ALAN: Are you
going to try again?

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:41.290
MELODY YANG: Why not?

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:42.400
Yeah.

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:43.455
I would like to.

00:06:43.455 --> 00:06:45.080
We just need to get
everybody together,

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.288
but right now it's like
we're all all over the place.

00:06:47.288 --> 00:06:49.120
ALAN: Well I think
you should try that.

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.430
We'll film that for you.

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:54.430
You're talking about
performing around the world.

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:57.830
Normally, I guess, how do
you travel with the show?

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:00.030
This is obviously sort
of a complicated set,

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:02.710
but when you and the
family get hired out

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:04.390
to go-- you said
Deni, your brother,

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:06.340
is in Orlando right now.

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:08.320
I know that you've
been to Orlando,

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:10.990
all over Europe you said.

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:15.670
How do you decide what goes
where and who does what show?

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:18.190
MELODY YANG: So
it really depends.

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:20.680
For me, I'm mostly
in New York because I

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:23.390
like to be in New
York, or it depends

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:25.480
like if we travel somewhere.

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:29.340
My brother-- when we
bring the show overseas,

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:32.250
then we would usually
have another set

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:36.500
of all of our bubble machines,
our bubble props, our lights,

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:40.960
our sound, our LED
screens, our LED trees.

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:44.950
So we have another
set here in the US

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:47.140
and we have another set in Asia.

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:49.790
Then we have another
set in Europe.

00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:53.170
So once we confirm
a show overseas,

00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:56.200
that's when we bring that
whole production there

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:58.460
and one of the
artists goes there.

00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:01.180
And sometimes we'll rock
paper scissors who goes where.

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:05.585
I've actually done that once.

00:08:05.585 --> 00:08:09.970
ALAN: So you said your dad's
working on something new.

00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:12.490
Is it normally him that
comes up with new things,

00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:15.040
or are you like in your
apartment here in New York

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:17.830
just like playing with
the bubble mixture trying

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:18.550
to do new things?

00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:20.675
MELODY YANG: Well, it's
usually all of us together.

00:08:20.675 --> 00:08:25.660
So if we're all here at
one time and if someone's

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:27.670
performing on stage,
we'll all come together

00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:30.190
and we'll see what we
can do that's different.

00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:32.169
Or we'll come across
certain things

00:08:32.169 --> 00:08:35.409
as we're performing, because
all of our performances,

00:08:35.409 --> 00:08:38.200
they're not exactly the same
sometimes because bubbles

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:39.220
are unpredictable.

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:42.865
We can manipulate it so much,
but still, if it bursts,

00:08:42.865 --> 00:08:45.400
it bursts and we have to
come up with something

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:47.900
else on the spot.

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:50.950
But when we have those
kind of situations,

00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:53.680
that's when we share our
ideas with each other.

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:56.650
Like recently, what did we do?

00:08:56.650 --> 00:08:59.371
The bubble snowman, we
weren't doing that before.

00:08:59.371 --> 00:09:01.120
And then Christmas was
coming, I was like,

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:03.640
I want to try to make a snowman,
so I made a bubble snowman.

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:05.140
And then my brother
started to do it

00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:06.598
and he started to
get better at it.

00:09:06.598 --> 00:09:09.986
And I'm like, OK, I
need to step up my game.

00:09:09.986 --> 00:09:12.590
ALAN: So you have the sibling
rivalry still a little bit

00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:13.090
there?

00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:13.856
MELODY YANG: Yeah, sometimes.

00:09:13.856 --> 00:09:16.240
ALAN: I think one of the
most interesting facts

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:19.420
about you guys in general--

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:22.330
I think it was Deni that told
me this when you guys came in

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:24.260
to perform at the
Google office, was

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:28.750
that you did the bubble design
for "SpongeBob SquarePants"

00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:29.330
the musical.

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:30.080
MELODY YANG: Yeah.

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:32.700
ALAN: So that's true, yeah?

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:35.560
MELODY YANG: What do you
mean the bubble design?

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:38.770
We helped them
with their bubbles.

00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:41.284
So they were having
bubble problems.

00:09:41.284 --> 00:09:42.700
ALAN: People have
bubble problems?

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:43.630
MELODY YANG: Yes.

00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:46.120
They had bubble problems,
my brother came in,

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:48.670
and their bubbles
weren't working.

00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:52.960
They would appear and
disappear so quickly, and also

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:55.630
the positioning of where
they put their machines.

00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:58.630
So my brother, being
the bubble consultant,

00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:00.710
came in and told them
where to place it,

00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:04.720
and also, we started to
provide them our solution.

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:07.420
And now, they are
having zero problems

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:08.560
and everything is great.

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:10.992
ALAN: I've seen the show and
the bubbles are quite good.

00:10:10.992 --> 00:10:11.950
MELODY YANG: It's good?

00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:12.450
All right.

00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:13.030
ALAN: Yeah.

00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:15.280
I enjoy it.

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:19.000
So you might get the impression
that, being a bubble show,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.590
that it's all like
just for kids.

00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:22.744
The audience, you see
the kids jumping around,

00:10:22.744 --> 00:10:24.160
you see the photos
and everything.

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:25.230
Do you agree with that?

00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:28.180
Do you think it's just for kids
or do you do it for the adults

00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:28.750
as well?

00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:30.125
MELODY YANG: I do
it for everyone

00:10:30.125 --> 00:10:32.740
because I think every
single person in this world

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:34.970
still has a kid inside them.

00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:37.770
So I think when
people see bubbles,

00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:40.540
it touches that kid inside
them, no matter what.

00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:43.270
And when I'm
performing on stage,

00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:48.430
you don't see only the kids
reach out for the bubbles.

00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:51.580
You see the parents, the
grandparents, and everyone.

00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:53.380
Every time they do
it, they're smiling.

00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:54.100
You know?

00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:58.540
Bubbles just makes people happy,
and I think it's for everybody.

00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:00.520
Yeah, it's for kids
because it's something

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:02.320
that you remember
when you're young

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:05.040
and it's something that's so
fascinating that you can't even

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:07.040
wrap your mind around,
because you're like, what

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:08.430
is this floating object?

00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:09.940
It's not water.

00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:13.690
It's not a solid, but
it's a water-based sphere.

00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:18.520
And so I think that's
what always kept me going,

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:21.510
is to see people
captured in that moment.

00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:23.010
ALAN: Right.

00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:26.700

enjoying the show so far?

00:21:24.524 --> 00:21:25.328
Pretty good?

All right, well, before
we continue any further,

00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:31.300
I would like to tell you guys
a little bit more about myself.

00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:32.610
My name is Deni Yang.

00:21:32.610 --> 00:21:36.630
I'm 27 years old and
I still blow bubbles.

00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:38.510
I do own two Guinness
World Records.

00:21:38.510 --> 00:21:41.670
One for the world's
largest bubble of 170 feet

00:21:41.670 --> 00:21:45.330
in length, and the second one,
which was for the most people

00:21:45.330 --> 00:21:47.310
inside of a soap bubble.

00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:50.480
Any guesses of how many people?

00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:52.910
Try 181.

00:21:52.910 --> 00:21:55.410
So you can imagine how big
these bubbles are, right?

00:21:55.410 --> 00:21:57.900
Now, unfortunately, I
can't do it here for you,

00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:00.780
but I did bring one tiny
video clip to show everybody.

00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:01.280
OK.

00:22:04.250 --> 00:22:07.040
All right.

00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:07.550
Here we go.

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:12.030
That's your cue.

00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:14.850
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:22:14.850 --> 00:22:17.420
So the record was actually
held in Beijing, China,

00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:20.930
and the style of the bubble
itself was designed to be

00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:22.604
like the Great Wall of China.

00:22:22.604 --> 00:22:24.770
This is going to be the
video of the world's largest

00:22:24.770 --> 00:22:27.630
bubble, which took nearly
two months of preparations

00:22:27.630 --> 00:22:32.370
and almost 500 gallons
of bubble soap solution.

00:22:32.370 --> 00:22:33.802
That's a lot of bubble soap.

00:22:33.802 --> 00:22:36.260
The record was held by my entire
family, so as you can see,

00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:40.895
my father, mother, sister,
and finally, my uncle.

00:22:40.895 --> 00:22:41.520
And here we go.

00:22:45.690 --> 00:22:48.620
Now, the bubble itself
had a surface area

00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:52.100
of nearly 5,000 square
feet, and of course, it

00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:56.180
took my entire family
of performers to do it.

00:22:56.180 --> 00:22:57.555
Let's check it
out one last time.

00:23:00.989 --> 00:23:03.530
And so, as of now, the current
record for the world's largest

00:23:03.530 --> 00:23:10.840
bubble is still at 170 feet
in length, with a happy uncle.

00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:11.710
I do appreciate it.

00:23:11.710 --> 00:23:13.510
Thank you.

00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:16.050
All right.

00:23:16.050 --> 00:23:16.570
I really do.

00:23:16.570 --> 00:23:17.500
Thank you.

00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:20.280
I really appreciate it.

00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:23.460
So for the next part
of the performance,

00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:25.650
I would like to actually
introduce my sister,

00:23:25.650 --> 00:23:27.640
so let's give her
a warm welcome.

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:28.140
Melody.

00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:33.380
MELODY YANG: Hi, everyone.

00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:34.800
Thanks, Deni.

00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:36.690
Me and Deni actually--
well, you guys

00:23:36.690 --> 00:23:38.490
are probably wondering
how the heck did we

00:23:38.490 --> 00:23:40.080
get into this business, right?

00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:41.910
I mean, me and my
brother, we've been

00:23:41.910 --> 00:23:45.120
performing since I was
about three and him four.

00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:47.670
Both our parents were
performers and they both

00:23:47.670 --> 00:23:51.600
started out juggling,
magic acts, acrobats,

00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:52.390
you guys name it.

00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:54.540
And they were street
performers at first.

00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:57.060
And then my father
came up with bubbles

00:23:57.060 --> 00:23:59.640
and he was always fascinated
about bubbles just

00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:01.090
like we are every single day.

00:24:01.090 --> 00:24:04.440
Every time we see a bubble,
we stop to stare, right?

00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:07.200
So from there, my dad
created a solution

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:10.560
where he could create a
show out of just bubbles.

00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:13.380
And from there, me
and Deni came along,

00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:16.290
and then he started to teach us
when we were little toddlers.

00:24:16.290 --> 00:24:18.780
And we were performing
in circuses and galas

00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:21.925
all over the world, all
over Europe especially.

00:24:21.925 --> 00:24:24.420
DENI YANG: We would,
I guess, get punished

00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:27.157
if we don't do good bubbles.

00:24:27.157 --> 00:24:28.740
MELODY YANG: But I
mean, that's pretty

00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:31.210
much about how we got into it.

00:24:31.210 --> 00:24:34.950
So for this part, I do
want to show you guys

00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:36.990
how to make your own
bubbles using just

00:24:36.990 --> 00:24:39.090
your hands and bubble soap.

00:24:39.090 --> 00:24:41.130
And I'm going to
need two volunteers.

00:24:41.130 --> 00:24:42.135
DENI YANG: Big smiles.

00:24:42.135 --> 00:24:43.645
MELODY YANG: Let's see.

00:24:43.645 --> 00:24:44.520
All right, let's see.

00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:51.090
I want to see who is sitting
nicely down in their seat, OK?

00:24:51.090 --> 00:24:53.580
Let's see, I want
to get two people.

00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:55.020
All right, big smiles.

00:24:55.020 --> 00:24:57.120
Let's see over here.

00:24:57.120 --> 00:24:59.910
Hm.

00:24:59.910 --> 00:25:01.260
Do you want to come?

00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:01.830
Yeah, come.

00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:02.730
Let's go.

00:25:02.730 --> 00:25:03.780

00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:06.435

00:25:06.435 --> 00:25:08.100

00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:08.621
You got it?

00:25:08.621 --> 00:25:09.120
All right.

00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:11.756
I'm going to need
one more person, OK?

00:25:11.756 --> 00:25:12.630
All right, let's see.

00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:14.088
You want to stay
right here for me?

00:25:14.088 --> 00:25:16.950
Let's see, I see a boy in a
blue shirt right over there.

00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:19.170
Yeah, a blue t-shirt.

00:25:19.170 --> 00:25:21.820
Come on, buddy.

00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:22.340
There we go.

00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:23.173
Watch your step, OK?

00:25:23.173 --> 00:25:24.370
It's a little slippery.

00:25:24.370 --> 00:25:26.036
So I'm going to need
one of you to stand

00:25:26.036 --> 00:25:28.230
here and one right over there.

00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:28.760
Awesome.

00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:29.570
What is your name?

00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:30.195
OLIVIA: Olivia.

00:25:30.195 --> 00:25:31.785
MELODY YANG: Olivia,
nice to meet you.

00:25:31.785 --> 00:25:32.660
And what's your name?

00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:33.159
EDDY: Eddy.

00:25:33.159 --> 00:25:33.920
MELODY YANG: Eddy?

00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:35.030
Nice to meet you guys.

00:25:35.030 --> 00:25:38.220
So inside here, I have a
bowl of bubble solution.

00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:40.490
What I'm trying to do is
I'm going to make a bubble

00:25:40.490 --> 00:25:43.970
and I just want you guys to
copy exactly what I do, OK?

00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:44.570
All right?

00:25:44.570 --> 00:25:47.050
So watch me first.

00:25:47.050 --> 00:25:50.618
All right, Olivia, watch this.

00:25:57.310 --> 00:25:59.600
Looks pretty easy, right?

00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:00.726
No?

00:26:00.726 --> 00:26:01.730
All right, you guys try.

00:26:01.730 --> 00:26:02.896
Let's see what you guys got.

00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:12.448
Oh, not too bad.

00:26:12.448 --> 00:26:12.948
OK.

00:26:16.099 --> 00:26:17.640
I'm going to walk
you guys through it

00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:19.470
step by step, all right?

00:26:19.470 --> 00:26:23.147
So then when you guys go home,
you guys can do this at home.

00:26:23.147 --> 00:26:24.980
Now he's like, I'm just
going to keep going.

00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:28.050
All right, so first, Olivia,
you guys want to watch me?

00:26:28.050 --> 00:26:29.150
Your hand has to be wet.

00:26:29.150 --> 00:26:30.900
Otherwise, the bubble's
going to pop if it

00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:33.250
touches anywhere that's dry.

00:26:33.250 --> 00:26:35.160
Next, I'm going to
make an OK sign.

00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:37.020
You guys see that?

00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:39.510
I'm going to dip my hand
in all the way through.

00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:41.190
OK?

00:26:41.190 --> 00:26:44.310
And now I'm just going to flip
my wrist backwards a little bit

00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:48.210
and blow a stream of air,
not too strong not too soft.

00:26:51.060 --> 00:26:53.410
And this part is very important.

00:26:53.410 --> 00:26:55.260
I'm going to close
that hole so that we

00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:57.280
can capture the air inside.

00:26:57.280 --> 00:26:58.359
Yeah?

00:26:58.359 --> 00:26:59.400
Let's try it again, guys.

00:27:02.432 --> 00:27:04.140
You want to get your
hand all the way in.

00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:05.160
Let's make an OK sign.

00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:07.460
Make an OK sign.

00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:08.060
It's cold?

00:27:08.060 --> 00:27:09.210
I know, but it's clean.

00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:14.366
Oh, you got it.

00:27:14.366 --> 00:27:15.760
Oh.

00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:17.920
Make sure to close the hole, OK?

00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:18.750
To capture the air.

00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:25.460
All right, not bad.

00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:27.286
Not bad.

00:27:27.286 --> 00:27:28.790
All right, so
we're going to move

00:27:28.790 --> 00:27:30.553
on to something really cool.

00:27:30.553 --> 00:27:31.400
OK?

00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:33.480
This time, we're going
to make smoke bubbles.

00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:34.790
How does that sound?

00:27:34.790 --> 00:27:35.525
Oh, nice.

00:27:35.525 --> 00:27:37.226
Want to pass it to me?

00:27:37.226 --> 00:27:39.100
And now you're going to
put it in your pocket

00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:39.975
and take it home, OK?

00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:44.180
All right, guys.

00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:45.350
Now for the next part.

00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:48.020
Olivia, can you dip both
your hands into the solution?

00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:50.180
OLIVIA: Right now there's
a bubble on my hand.

00:27:50.180 --> 00:27:51.221
MELODY YANG: There we go.

00:27:51.221 --> 00:27:53.190
It's not there anymore.

00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:53.690
All right.

00:27:53.690 --> 00:27:54.640
Let's get soaked.

00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:57.920
I know it's cold, but
don't worry about it.

00:27:57.920 --> 00:27:59.770
We're going to hold
our hand out like this.

00:27:59.770 --> 00:28:00.625
Perfect.

00:28:00.625 --> 00:28:01.510
All right.

00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:04.460
So when you guys
try this at home,

00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:08.190
you're going to ask your
parents for a lot of money, OK?

00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:09.520
Just joking.

00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:11.754
Stay there.

00:28:11.754 --> 00:28:12.670
Don't move.

00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:18.150
So this is a water-based smoke.

00:28:18.150 --> 00:28:19.860
It's nontoxic.

00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:24.820
It's very light and
it's easy to control.

00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:27.862
And now, Olivia, can you guys
connect the bubble together?

00:28:27.862 --> 00:28:28.570
Or do that again.

00:28:36.930 --> 00:28:37.450
Careful, OK?

00:28:37.450 --> 00:28:38.730
I'm going to make
it first and I'll

00:28:38.730 --> 00:28:40.063
let you know when to connect it.

00:28:45.090 --> 00:28:46.140
Bubbles pop.

00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:48.810
It's normal.

00:28:48.810 --> 00:28:49.590
Hands are dry.

00:28:53.590 --> 00:28:57.742
Have you guys ever wondered
why bubbles make you happy?

00:28:57.742 --> 00:28:59.450
OLIVIA: Because they're
fun to play with?

00:28:59.450 --> 00:29:00.570
MELODY YANG: Yeah.

00:29:00.570 --> 00:29:04.170
They are fun to play
with, but it always

00:29:04.170 --> 00:29:07.840
brings back memories,
especially for us older people.

00:29:10.810 --> 00:29:13.072
I mean, I can do this forever.

00:29:13.072 --> 00:29:15.280
All right, now let's connect it.

00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:15.780
There we go.

00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:21.874
Awesome, guys.

00:29:21.874 --> 00:29:22.374
Perfect.

00:29:22.374 --> 00:29:24.142
Let's give them a
round of applause.

00:29:27.090 --> 00:29:29.140
Here, you want to
dry your hands out?

00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:30.480
There we go.

00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:32.850
Here's a towel.

00:29:32.850 --> 00:29:33.540
Don't move, OK?

00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:34.945
I got you guys something.

00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:40.870
You want to hold onto this?

00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:42.065
I'll grab that.

00:29:42.065 --> 00:29:42.565
OK.

00:29:42.565 --> 00:29:43.210
OLIVIA: Do we get to keep these?

00:29:43.210 --> 00:29:44.650
MELODY YANG: You
keep those, just

00:29:44.650 --> 00:29:47.884
make sure you don't drink them.

00:29:47.884 --> 00:29:48.550
Thank you, guys.

00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:50.740
Watch your step when
you go down, OK?

00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:52.420
You were this way, right?

00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:54.450
Watch the stairs.

00:29:54.450 --> 00:29:55.450
Got it?

00:29:55.450 --> 00:29:56.880
All right.

00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:57.380
OK.

00:29:57.380 --> 00:30:00.640
So for the next
part, I want to put

00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:04.000
some people inside
a bubble, and I'm

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.940
going to need another volunteer.

00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:10.640
So let's see here.

00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:13.430
We've got someone over
there, over there.

00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:13.930
Let's see.

00:30:13.930 --> 00:30:16.010
I want to see big smiles.

00:30:16.010 --> 00:30:18.010
Who's excited to
be here at Google?

00:30:18.010 --> 00:30:20.500
Because I know I am.

00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:21.730
Do you want to come?

00:30:21.730 --> 00:30:23.410
Let's go.

00:30:23.410 --> 00:30:24.135
All right.

00:30:24.135 --> 00:30:25.410
Watch your step.

00:30:25.410 --> 00:30:28.720
We're going to go
in the center here.

00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:30.755
Tell me, what is your name?

00:30:30.755 --> 00:30:31.255
OWEN: Owen.

00:30:31.255 --> 00:30:32.004
MELODY YANG: Owen?

00:30:32.004 --> 00:30:33.090
How old are you, Owen?

00:30:33.090 --> 00:30:33.910
OWEN: Seven.

00:30:33.910 --> 00:30:34.720
MELODY YANG: Seven years old?

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:35.511
Where are you from?

00:30:35.511 --> 00:30:36.136
OWEN: New York.

00:30:36.136 --> 00:30:37.261
MELODY YANG: From New York?

00:30:37.261 --> 00:30:37.780
Very nice.

00:30:37.780 --> 00:30:40.330
So you came all the way from
New York to see the show?

00:30:40.330 --> 00:30:41.996
Oh, thanks.

00:30:41.996 --> 00:30:43.870
Well, Owen, you're going
to stand right here.

00:30:43.870 --> 00:30:46.520
You're going to look at
everyone and just smile, OK?

00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:49.570
You don't have to do anything.

00:30:49.570 --> 00:30:51.650
Stay right there.

00:30:51.650 --> 00:30:52.618
Here we go.

00:30:58.962 --> 00:31:00.426
How about that?

00:31:03.490 --> 00:31:04.900
Let's do that one more time.

00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:09.960
Awesome.

00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:11.084
Owen, stay here, OK?

00:31:11.084 --> 00:31:13.000
I'm going to put another
person in the bubble,

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:17.160
so I'm going to find
you a beautiful girl.

00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:18.210
All right, let's see.

00:31:18.210 --> 00:31:19.616
Girls?

00:31:19.616 --> 00:31:21.104
Mhm.

00:31:21.104 --> 00:31:24.080
Let's see here.

00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:25.700
Do you want to come?

00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:26.200
All right.

00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:27.980
Here, let me help you, OK?

00:31:27.980 --> 00:31:30.320
Let's stand right
next to Owen here.

00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:31.930
Perfect.

00:31:31.930 --> 00:31:32.790
What is your name?

00:31:32.790 --> 00:31:33.721
RACHEL: Rachel.

00:31:33.721 --> 00:31:34.720
MELODY YANG: What is it?

00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:35.412
RACHEL: Rachel.

00:31:35.412 --> 00:31:37.210
MELODY YANG: Rachel, right?

00:31:37.210 --> 00:31:38.950
How old are you, Rachel?

00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:39.850
RACHEL: Three.

00:31:39.850 --> 00:31:41.530
MELODY YANG: Three years
old, and where are you from?

00:31:41.530 --> 00:31:42.220
RACHEL: I'm four
and one quarter.

00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:44.170
MELODY YANG: Oh, you're
four and one quarter.

00:31:44.170 --> 00:31:45.031
Oh, you just forgot.

00:31:45.031 --> 00:31:45.530
What?

00:31:45.530 --> 00:31:46.202
RACHEL: Brooklyn.

00:31:46.202 --> 00:31:47.500
MELODY YANG: You're
from Brooklyn.

00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:48.240
All right, cool.

00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:49.175
Brooklyn and New York.

00:31:49.175 --> 00:31:50.420
Here we go, guys.

00:31:50.420 --> 00:31:51.690
You ready?

00:31:51.690 --> 00:31:54.542
Smile and don't move.

00:31:54.542 --> 00:31:56.141
All right, let's do this.

00:31:56.141 --> 00:31:56.640
Here we go.

00:31:56.640 --> 00:32:00.242
One, two, and three.

00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:08.480
That's not working.

00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:08.980
OK.

00:32:13.290 --> 00:32:15.310
Owen, turn your body this way.

00:32:15.310 --> 00:32:15.870
OK?

00:32:15.870 --> 00:32:16.910
This way.

00:32:16.910 --> 00:32:17.660
OK?

00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:18.750
And your head that way.

00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:19.250
OK.

00:32:23.042 --> 00:32:24.030
And don't move.

00:32:24.030 --> 00:32:26.370
Stay still, OK?

00:32:26.370 --> 00:32:28.580
And you too, Rachel,
your body this way

00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:30.240
and your head that way.

00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:33.937
OK, perfect.

00:32:33.937 --> 00:32:36.080
It's a little awkward.

00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:40.910
Let's stand a little
bit more closer.

00:32:40.910 --> 00:32:41.930
OK, one more step.

00:32:44.570 --> 00:32:45.330
All right.

00:32:45.330 --> 00:32:48.410
A little bit more.

00:32:48.410 --> 00:32:49.120
Don't move.

00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:50.971
Stay right there.

Here we go.

00:33:22.275 --> 00:33:24.570

under so it's easy to hold.

Here we go.

00:33:26.090 --> 00:33:27.130
