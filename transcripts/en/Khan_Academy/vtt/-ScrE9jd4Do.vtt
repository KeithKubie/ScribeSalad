00:00:00.897 --> 00:00:04.849
- The number B is five less than twice

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:06.089
the number C.

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:06.962
Let me write that down.

00:00:06.962 --> 00:00:11.229
So B is equal to five less than

00:00:11.229 --> 00:00:12.590
twice the number C.

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.267
So that's two times C minus five.

00:00:16.267 --> 00:00:19.209
It's five less than
two times the number C.

00:00:20.534 --> 00:00:24.374
The product of B and C is 45.

00:00:24.374 --> 00:00:28.657
So I could write that as
B times C is equal to 45.

00:00:29.595 --> 00:00:31.607
Which of the following pairs of equations

00:00:31.607 --> 00:00:35.889
could be used to find
the values of B and C?

00:00:36.253 --> 00:00:37.111
So let's see.

00:00:37.523 --> 00:00:40.468
So this one we have 45 is equal to BC,

00:00:40.468 --> 00:00:42.338
45 is equal to BC,

00:00:42.338 --> 00:00:43.678
so these are contenders.

00:00:43.678 --> 00:00:46.930
This one has 45C is equal to B.

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.513
Well that's like, this
is a different equation.

00:00:48.513 --> 00:00:50.688
If you divided both sides by C,

00:00:50.688 --> 00:00:52.537
you would have 45 is equal to B over C,

00:00:52.537 --> 00:00:54.584
so we can knock this one out.

00:00:54.813 --> 00:00:57.515
This one has 45C is equal to B.

00:00:57.515 --> 00:00:59.021
Well once again, 45C equals B,

00:00:59.021 --> 00:01:00.849
we can knock that one out.

00:01:00.849 --> 00:01:02.774
This one has 45 is equal to BC.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.598
So now we can just focus on
the first of these equations.

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:07.290
So let's see.

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.331
B is equal to two minus 5C.

00:01:09.331 --> 00:01:11.663
No, it should be 2C minus five.

00:01:11.952 --> 00:01:13.471
So we can knock that one out.

00:01:13.678 --> 00:01:16.214
B is equal to 2C minus five.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:17.930
Well that's exactly what I wrote here.

00:01:18.037 --> 00:01:20.029
BC is equal to 45.

00:01:20.029 --> 00:01:21.385
That's exactly what I wrote here.

00:01:21.531 --> 00:01:23.952
Wrote over here, so this
is going to be our choice.

00:01:23.952 --> 00:01:26.527
So we can verify that this
last one isn't going to work.

00:01:26.817 --> 00:01:29.210
B is equal to two times C plus five.

00:01:29.458 --> 00:01:30.636
Well, if you distribute the two,

00:01:30.636 --> 00:01:33.217
that's like saying that B is equal to 2C

00:01:33.217 --> 00:01:35.613
plus 10, which is clearly different

00:01:35.613 --> 00:01:37.890
than this first equation
that I wrote up here.

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.119
So we can knock that out as well.
