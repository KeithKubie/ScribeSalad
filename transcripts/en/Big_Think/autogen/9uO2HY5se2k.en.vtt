pledges into the private sector over the

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290
pledges into the private sector over the
 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:08.960
pledges into the private sector over the
past 18 months and I think you would see

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970
past 18 months and I think you would see
 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.820
past 18 months and I think you would see
much more that if people felt that the

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830
much more that if people felt that the
 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.170

of the things that's distressing when
you see a place like China we always

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620
you see a place like China we always
 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.020
you see a place like China we always
emphasize the political system of the

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030
emphasize the political system of the
 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.640
emphasize the political system of the
human rights abuses of the jasmine

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650
human rights abuses of the jasmine
 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.520
human rights abuses of the jasmine
revolution we all of which is important

revolution we all of which is important
 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.199
revolution we all of which is important

but they are doing real making real
 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:29.030
but they are doing real making real
investments to make people's kind of

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040
investments to make people's kind of
 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.430
investments to make people's kind of
daily lives incrementally better by the

week in a way that we've just forgotten

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709
week in a way that we've just forgotten
 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:38.420
week in a way that we've just forgotten
to do and asking ourselves in a kind of

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430
to do and asking ourselves in a kind of
 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:39.949
to do and asking ourselves in a kind of
very deep way why is it that our

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959
very deep way why is it that our
 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:41.569
very deep way why is it that our
political system is unable to be

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579
political system is unable to be
 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:43.130
political system is unable to be
responsive to people's everyday needs in

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140
responsive to people's everyday needs in
 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.130
responsive to people's everyday needs in
a way that an authoritarian system is is

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140
a way that an authoritarian system is is
 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.680
a way that an authoritarian system is is
a very serious question well we can Envy

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690
a very serious question well we can Envy
 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.509
a very serious question well we can Envy
the authoritarian system for its ability

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519
the authoritarian system for its ability
 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:52.250
the authoritarian system for its ability
to make big investments in plan for the

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260
to make big investments in plan for the
 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.110
to make big investments in plan for the
long term but the fact is there's very

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120
long term but the fact is there's very
 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.060
long term but the fact is there's very
little accountability in that system and

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.070
little accountability in that system and
 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:57.770
little accountability in that system and
so if you think that there would be

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780
so if you think that there would be
 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.140
so if you think that there would be
wasted in a project that politicians

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150
wasted in a project that politicians
 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.000
wasted in a project that politicians
declare that they're going to invest in

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010
declare that they're going to invest in
 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.680
declare that they're going to invest in
here there's an enormous amount of

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690
here there's an enormous amount of
 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.420
here there's an enormous amount of
wastage going on in these authoritarian

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430
wastage going on in these authoritarian
 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.160
wastage going on in these authoritarian
regimes too and they will eventually pay

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170
regimes too and they will eventually pay
 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:08.900
regimes too and they will eventually pay
the price for that as well so we do all

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910
the price for that as well so we do all
 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:10.340
the price for that as well so we do all
agree that we have to invest in our

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350
agree that we have to invest in our
 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:11.870
agree that we have to invest in our
infrastructure and that it's not going

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880
infrastructure and that it's not going
 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:12.800
infrastructure and that it's not going
to be perfect there's a lot of

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810
to be perfect there's a lot of
 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.090
to be perfect there's a lot of
uncertainty but there's an equal amount

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100
uncertainty but there's an equal amount
 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:15.349
uncertainty but there's an equal amount
of uncertainty in authoritarian

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:15.359
of uncertainty in authoritarian
 

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:17.240
of uncertainty in authoritarian
societies like China where they make

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250
societies like China where they make
 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:18.920
societies like China where they make
lots of investments but there is in fact

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930
lots of investments but there is in fact
 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.250
lots of investments but there is in fact
a lot of corruption as well so but there

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260
a lot of corruption as well so but there
 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.290
a lot of corruption as well so but there
is a consensus that we have to rebuild

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300
is a consensus that we have to rebuild
 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.450
is a consensus that we have to rebuild
so with that thanks for your insights

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460
so with that thanks for your insights
 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:27.300
so with that thanks for your insights
