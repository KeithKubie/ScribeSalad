00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:16.910
Arachibutyrophobia is a proposed humorous
name for the fear of peanut butter getting

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.820
stuck to the top of your mouth, coined by
Charles M. Schulz in a 1982 edition of his

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.640
famed Peanuts comic strip.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.210
But why does peanut butter have such a tendency
to get stuck in your palate when so many other

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:29.210
foods don’t?

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:34.190
As it so happens, peanut butter contains a
perfect storm of ingredients seemingly designed

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.059
with the express intent of creating a peanut
flavoured choking hazard.

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:43.140
For starters, peanut butter, shockingly enough,
contains a lot of peanut oil, which makes

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.750
it incredibly difficult for your saliva to
perform its normal task of helping in this

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.190
first stage of processing food; as we all
know, oil and water don’t really like to

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.190
mix.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.199
Peanut butter also contains a lot of protein
(about 25% by mass, give or take depending

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:55.420
on the brand).

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.320
Protein has a tendency to soak up moisture
via osmotic pressure, thus absorbing much

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.559
of the saliva in your mouth.

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.750
This effect is made worse than with most foods
due the fact that peanut butter also has incredibly

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.330
low water content (only about 2%.

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.340
For reference, jerky, which is by its very
definition “dried meat”, tends to have

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.370
a water content of about 23%.)

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:20.369
It’s also worth noting that bread can similarly
absorb some of the moisture from your mouth,

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.450
which combined with the peanut butter, can
leave your mouth incredibly dry when eating

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.610
a peanut butter sandwich.

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.500
But wait, there’s more.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.619
In addition to the oil and lack of moisture
to wash down the peanut butter with, there’s

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:38.160
a process in the food industry known as “supercritical
fluid extraction” which uses CO2 to separate

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.609
chemicals and compounds.

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:44.939
SFE can be used for a multitude of tasks in
the food industry, like decaffeinating coffee

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.130
and extracting essential oils and flavours
from plants and foods.

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.580
In regards to peanuts specifically, it can
be used during the manufacturing process of

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.240
peanut butter to help keep the oils and solids
from separating without the need for other

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.360
more traditional stabilizers like unhealthy
hydrogenated oils.

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.890
And, as this paper in the Journal of Food
Science explains, one side-effect of SFE in

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.590
peanut butter manufacturing is that it increases
the relative “adhesiveness” of the peanut

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:12.590
butter.

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.100
Another thing that makes peanut butter so
deliciously sticky is its texture, or lack

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.100
thereof.

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.330
Smooth peanut butter is noted as being far
more likely to stick to the roof of your mouth

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:27.120
than the chunky kind because the smooth, thick,
deliciously creamy surface can form a “suction

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.290
cup” of sorts that can anchor the peanut
paste to a person’s palate.

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.290
Have you ever got your foot stuck in mud?

00:02:34.290 --> 00:03:47.760
Same type of thing here.
