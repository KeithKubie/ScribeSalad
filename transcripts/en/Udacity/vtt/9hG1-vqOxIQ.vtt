00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:02.280
Wow, you did a Latin version point two.

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.080
There's a lot on this screen,
it's looking pretty slick.

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.109
&gt;&gt; Well it wasn't just me,
we've been hard at work.

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:09.730
&gt;&gt; Do you want to look at the y frames?

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:11.550
&gt;&gt; Yeah sure,
let's review what we've done.

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.120
In version zero point two the app,

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.129
you made the fundamental screens
of shopping list plus plus.

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:19.704
This included the main screen with all
the lists, also known as the shopping

00:00:19.704 --> 00:00:22.240
lists fragment, and
the shopping list detail screen,

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.220
also known as the active
list details activity.

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.830
In order to do this, you needed to
master reading and writing data.

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.360
You also learned about
the FirebaseUI library,

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.230
which helps you easily show up to
date Firebase data in the list view.

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.640
At this point, you've got an app that
can be edited by a bunch of users

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.110
simultaneously, which can add lists,
rename them, and delete them.

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.810
Inside of those lists, we've also
got items that any user can add.

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:49.170
And on your own, I'm going to
have you work on the edit and

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.840
delete functionality for those items.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.390
&gt;&gt; If your users work well together,
I'd say this is a pretty useful app.

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.280
&gt;&gt; Well, JP,
that's actually why you're here.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:57.780
Take a look.

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.530
&gt;&gt; Wow, do humans even eat those?

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.099
&gt;&gt; I don't know.
It seems that we have a troll in our

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:05.830
midst.

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.060
&gt;&gt; Well,
have you considered another option?

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.770
Maybe something from outside
your group of roommates?

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:12.820
Anyone who told them to?

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.550
&gt;&gt; But I hadn't shared
the code with anyone, unless.

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:17.310
You.

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.910
You.
Who have you been talking to?

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:20.340
You're under a non-disclosure agreement.

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.060
Was it Grocery Grabber?

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.220
How much did they pay you?

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:23.300
How much?
&gt;&gt; You know,

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.020
another way to solve this is to
implement user authentication Firebase.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.270
With user authentication, you can share
accounts, you can create lists and

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.810
add items to lists.

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.120
&gt;&gt; Interesting.
That's actually not a bad idea.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.980
&gt;&gt; Yeah and Firebase user
authentication is really pretty easy.

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.070
&gt;&gt; Well, I better read up
on user authentication, but

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.000
I'll see you both in version
point three of the app.
