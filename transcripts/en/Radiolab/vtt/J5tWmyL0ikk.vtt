00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:04.680
Great. You're listening to radio,

2
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.790
the podcast from New York public radio and public radio.

3
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.360
W. Y. C

4
00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:13.960
<v 1>n p. R.</v>

5
00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:19.400
[inaudible].

6
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.970
<v 0>Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad, and I'm busy listening to this. Who is it?</v>

7
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.400
I'm Robert Krulwich. This is Radiolab. The podcast. Yeah.

8
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:31.380
<v 1>Yes, please.</v>

9
00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.220
<v 0>So this person that you're hearing right now, testing, testing,</v>

10
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.070
she's one of my favorite, favorite musicians. You introduce yourself.

11
00:00:41.071 --> 00:00:43.230
My name is, I am a, my name's Juana Molina.

12
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.040
I'm quantum Medina and I am a musician.

13
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.310
I hope you enjoy what I do. Okay.

14
00:00:50.311 --> 00:00:53.550
So you know sometimes on this podcast instead of the science and the big ideas

15
00:00:53.551 --> 00:00:56.150
and the whatever we present musicians. Yup.

16
00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.730
Well that's what I want to do for the next 10 or so minutes.

17
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.140
Mostly cause I think she's amazing,

18
00:01:01.141 --> 00:01:03.900
but also because when we used for music in the sperm show,

19
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.720
I use it for some of the breaks. This song right here, in fact,

20
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.040
we get [inaudible] flood of email. People asking about,

21
00:01:10.041 --> 00:01:14.080
I wonder what she thought about being the breaks in the sperm show. She didn't.

22
00:01:14.081 --> 00:01:14.960
She doesn't know.

23
00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.910
So this podcast is for the bunch and bunch and bunch of people who wrote in

24
00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.060
asking about Juana Molina and also for the rest of you who maybe don't know her

25
00:01:23.061 --> 00:01:23.361
yet,

26
00:01:23.361 --> 00:01:28.070
but we'll hear her now and maybe I hope fall in love with her music as I have.

27
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.993
Yeah.

28
00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:33.510
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

29
00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.210
<v 0>so let me make space here. Okay.</v>

30
00:01:36.211 --> 00:01:40.140
So I spoke with her recently as she was in town to play a Gig at this club

31
00:01:40.141 --> 00:01:44.850
called the plots zone rouge request or who's the [inaudible] fish? Yup.

32
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.940
And she told me her backstory, it's to interesting,

33
00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.290
you started out as a musician taking piano lessons and guitar lessons,

34
00:01:52.291 --> 00:01:55.590
trying to be a performer. It wasn't really working out at that point.

35
00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.270
So she needed a job and she wasn't really sure what to do,

36
00:02:00.271 --> 00:02:03.960
but she knew she was always good at impressions. Something I could always do.

37
00:02:03.961 --> 00:02:07.980
And it was easy for me just to impersonate characters. And then,

38
00:02:07.981 --> 00:02:12.450
and you believe newer people like main stereotypes

39
00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.650
<v 2>or are [inaudible]</v>

40
00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.250
<v 0>I dunno if it's stereotypes or architects. Both. I mean, yeah.</v>

41
00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.470
<v 1>Oh, that's interesting. Yeah.</v>

42
00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.440
<v 0>And then one day was this parade looking for a job that gave me</v>

43
00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.520
enough money to play music and I thought TV was the best option. You,

44
00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.670
you went to TV to help pay for music.

45
00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.700
So what she did was she went over to the local TV station,

46
00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.810
somehow convinced them to give her a job reporting fake news,

47
00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.610
sort of like the daily show. And eventually she got her own show called

48
00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:48.160
Juana Isuzu [inaudible].

49
00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:50.693
<v 1>Okay.</v>

50
00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.120
<v 0>Which means Juana and her sisters. It was sort of a comedy show.</v>

51
00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.860
It was just a sketches. Yes. And how long did that go for? Three years.

52
00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.800
For the beginning it works very well because I had money and he could pay my

53
00:03:02.801 --> 00:03:07.420
rent and my guitar lessons. But then I got big. She became a huge hit.

54
00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.430
Was that the kind of situation where you'd walk down the street and be

55
00:03:09.431 --> 00:03:13.510
recognized? Yeah, much to her dismay. Oddly suddenly she was an actress,

56
00:03:13.511 --> 00:03:17.320
not a musician. And as she puts it, her life Kinda got out of hand.

57
00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.240
Well a, but then she got pregnant, I got pregnant and I needed to stay in bed.

58
00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.120
Um, so I had time to,

59
00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.370
to think about my life on the realize that I had totally missed my goal.

60
00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:34.120
It was just that I didn't want to miss it.

61
00:03:34.121 --> 00:03:37.900
I didn't want a dad and not having done what I wanted to do.

62
00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:43.080
So at the height of her popularity as an actress, she drops out. Yeah.

63
00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.020
That's not what I wanted. They just want it to be a musician.

64
00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.010
So she starts playing in these little clubs, just her and her guitar.

65
00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.040
People respond badly, didn't go so well.

66
00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:01.330
I'm going to try out a third and a fourth and fifth and some all in the way.

67
00:05:01.331 --> 00:05:05.170
And this is what I love. As you're listening, you slip into this universe.

68
00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:54.420
<v 1>Absolutely nothing that I really want to say really. I mean,</v>

69
00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.840
you have lyrics sometimes, most of the times.

70
00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:59.690
So when the song pops into your head and you develop it,

71
00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:03.410
you're not thinking of a story per se. No. Never.

72
00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:08.840
But you put the story on afterwards. Why in order to be able to sing? Yeah.

73
00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:13.250
One day, one day, one day, one day when dia,

74
00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:20.000
uh, how did that, how did that happen? Was what? I'm going up for the show.

75
00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:22.260
And I started to, I got bored and I started to play

76
00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.710
[inaudible] and it sounded like one day he wasn't saying one day,

77
00:07:28.711 --> 00:07:31.310
but it sounded like you didn't have the words just yet to know.

78
00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:32.820
But then when I was singing, Eh,

79
00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:35.423
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

80
00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:40.770
<v 1>game up on the [inaudible], the one day it will be someone.</v>

81
00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:28.860
<v 0>And Amazingly, her manager wrote me back and he said, totally,</v>

82
00:09:28.861 --> 00:09:32.510
you can remix it. Really? So I remixed the song. Oh my God. It was,

83
00:09:32.511 --> 00:09:35.280
was this guy, you know, was this going to bonus IRA? So was, where was he? No,

84
00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:39.300
it turns out he's just down the street. He was in New York.

85
00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:43.320
Can we hear your vision? Yeah. How can I do that?

86
00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:44.693
<v 1>Hold on.</v>

87
00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:57.960
<v 0>Okay, I've got it right here. Okay. So here it is.</v>

88
00:09:57.961 --> 00:10:02.961
Here's the short excerpt from a remix that her manager was nice enough to let me

89
00:10:03.181 --> 00:10:06.240
do of, of her song of Juana Molina Song when Dia
