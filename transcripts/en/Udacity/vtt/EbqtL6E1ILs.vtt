00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.050
The next principle is Robert Martin's dependency inversion principle,

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:07.710
which we have seen in an earlier lesson. It says that high level modules should

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.810
not depend upon low level modules. Both should instead depend upon abstractions.

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:16.440
This is related to inversion of control, in which normally abstraction framework

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.350
classes would make use of concrete client classes. It is the opposite to

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:24.670
the way that modules are structured in traditional layered architectures.

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.040
Stated another way, Martin is saying that our layering should be one of

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.180
abstraction, rather than one of control or data access. Doing so

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.500
will lead to designs in which the controlling principles are enforced at

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.140
the highest levels of our architecture
