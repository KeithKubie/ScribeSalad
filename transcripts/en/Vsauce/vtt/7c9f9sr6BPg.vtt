00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.100
Justin Bieber without eyebrows and a hungry

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.490
shirt.
It's episode 42 of IMG!

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.360
The lines on the carpet of this game
store produce the illusion of pockets and

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.199
dips. If you're still not dizzy,
take a swig from your Full House

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:20.960
flask and then wall down a poppy sandwich

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.119
or eat a cat or go to New York

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.720
and get yourself a big cat.
But let's be honest,

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.490
what you really want is a team of cats that serves

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:34.800
as your hair,
because the only thing more delicious

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.640
than cat boogers are panda boogers.
This

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.100
image never seems to end, nor does this
one, where a picture was taken

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.780
every hour and held next to the next
hour. The world's least portable

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.140
MP3 player at least makes more sense than this,

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.899
though it's all trumped by chair-chair.

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.940
Skull chair.
Obama and Biden

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.050
love watching IMG!
Maybe they like my beard,

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.350
'cause if so, they should know about the best beard

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.320
ever.
If you extrapolate a Barbie doll's proportions

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.360
to a woman six feet tall, she would look

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.430
like this. Oh, sorry, no, no, no, she would
look like

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.870
this. And now, thanks to BuzzFeed,
pictures taken at just the right moment

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.110
Here's a rainbow cleverly organizing all the colors

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.560
offered by Crayola since 1903.
At first,

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.220
you have these 8 colors,
but as time went on, the colors branched,

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.420
divided, more and more were offered.
And on the actual site,

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.619
you can mouse over each color for its official name.

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:51.670
This infographic is also neat.
The highest to the lowest. It shows

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.020
altitude above the death zone,
where humans can't breathe,

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.670
all the way down to Denver, Colorado,
the world's tallest building,

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.020
under sea levels to the Midnight zone,
the wreckage of the Titanic

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.269
and deeper. Oh, and here's one that breaks
down the stats behind

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:11.610
the words used on the Beatles'
"Abbey Road" album.

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.090
Teach your kids the importance of athletics. No!

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.860
Ffffound.com showed me some sweet pics -

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.370
Atari, Atari, fire heart.

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.590
In London this morning,
on my way to work, I beat

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.570
the universe by finding the Waldo family reunion.

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.700
They have great vehicle registration
plates here across the pond and no, no, no, no,

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.061
not that one. This one. But seriously,
their numbering scheme is interesting, so if

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.120
you want something to geek out about today,

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.340
go learn it.
And, as we exit, let's look at

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.620
"an exit," a guy running to the door...

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.280
Or maybe it's a flying man

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.860
wearing a cape, with a giant...

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:01.580
And as always,

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:02.760
thanks for watching.
