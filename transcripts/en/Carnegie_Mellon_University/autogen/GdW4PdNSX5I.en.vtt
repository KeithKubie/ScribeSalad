so then when time went on scientists

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630
so then when time went on scientists
 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.890
so then when time went on scientists
became even more destructive especially

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900

really do in real life which is to study
 

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:55.340
really do in real life which is to study
the secrets of nature and to study the

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:55.350
the secrets of nature and to study the
 

00:05:55.350 --> 00:06:01.100
the secrets of nature and to study the
laws of nature so let's see what Ron

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:01.110
laws of nature so let's see what Ron

science and not talk about religion so
 

00:08:19.979 --> 00:08:23.540
science and not talk about religion so
we will talk about science and leave the

now let me tell you the real CERN there

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:44.010
now let me tell you the real CERN there
 

00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:46.070
now let me tell you the real CERN there
is not really a hospital there's no

00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:46.080
is not really a hospital there's no
 

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:47.530
is not really a hospital there's no
movie theater and there's certainly no

recreational shooting range so what
about at the the real CERN

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:53.160
about at the the real CERN
 

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:54.830
about at the the real CERN
so if you look very closely if you paid

00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:54.840
so if you look very closely if you paid
 

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:56.720
so if you look very closely if you paid

is this antimatter well in order to
answer this question let's start first

00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:06.990
answer this question let's start first
 

00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:09.590
answer this question let's start first
with a simpler question which is what is

00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:09.600
with a simpler question which is what is
 

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:17.140
with a simpler question which is what is
matter so our building blocks of matter

00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:17.150
 

00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:19.490
so our current understanding of matter

00:18:19.490 --> 00:18:19.500
so our current understanding of matter
 

00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:21.560
so our current understanding of matter
is they're based on there are what we

00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:21.570
is they're based on there are what we
 

00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:24.380
is they're based on there are what we
call elementary particles named quarks

00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:24.390

there are six of them

00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:26.570
there are six of them
 

00:18:26.570 --> 00:18:30.070
there are six of them
they have names like oops like up or a

00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:30.080
they have names like oops like up or a
 

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:32.499

quark bottom quark and the top quark and
 

00:18:35.539 --> 00:18:38.710
quark bottom quark and the top quark and
then along with these six quark they go

00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:38.720
then along with these six quark they go
 

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:42.549
then along with these six quark they go
leptons where the electron is it's

00:18:42.549 --> 00:18:42.559
leptons where the electron is it's
 

00:18:42.559 --> 00:18:44.320
leptons where the electron is it's
probably the one that you all are

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:44.330
probably the one that you all are
 

00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:47.909
probably the one that you all are
familiar with but the electron has

00:18:47.909 --> 00:18:47.919
familiar with but the electron has
 

00:18:47.919 --> 00:18:51.310
familiar with but the electron has
heavier partners so there's a muon and a

00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:51.320
heavier partners so there's a muon and a
 

00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:54.580
heavier partners so there's a muon and a
towel and along with these leptons they

00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:54.590
towel and along with these leptons they
 

00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:58.899
towel and along with these leptons they
have partners they are called neutrinos

00:18:58.899 --> 00:18:58.909
have partners they are called neutrinos
 

00:18:58.909 --> 00:19:01.450
have partners they are called neutrinos
these are very elusive particles that

00:19:01.450 --> 00:19:01.460
these are very elusive particles that
 

00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:04.539
these are very elusive particles that
are for example created in the fusion a

00:19:04.539 --> 00:19:04.549
are for example created in the fusion a
 

00:19:04.549 --> 00:19:07.779
are for example created in the fusion a
process in the in the Sun and many many

00:19:07.779 --> 00:19:07.789
process in the in the Sun and many many
 

00:19:07.789 --> 00:19:10.539
process in the in the Sun and many many
of them go through you every every

00:19:10.539 --> 00:19:10.549
of them go through you every every
 

00:19:10.549 --> 00:19:12.340
of them go through you every every
seconds but they don't really do

00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:12.350
seconds but they don't really do
 

00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:14.039
seconds but they don't really do
anything because they very very rarely

00:19:14.039 --> 00:19:14.049
anything because they very very rarely
 

00:19:14.049 --> 00:19:17.619
anything because they very very rarely
interact with with matter and so if you

00:19:17.619 --> 00:19:17.629
interact with with matter and so if you
 

00:19:17.629 --> 00:19:20.440
interact with with matter and so if you
want to build what is around us all we

00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:20.450
want to build what is around us all we
 

00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:25.960
want to build what is around us all we
need is an up quark a down quark and and

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:25.970
need is an up quark a down quark and and
 

00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:28.720
need is an up quark a down quark and and
an electron so - with the up and a down

00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:28.730
an electron so - with the up and a down
 

00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:31.749
an electron so - with the up and a down
quark we can put two up quarks and one

00:19:31.749 --> 00:19:31.759
quark we can put two up quarks and one
 

00:19:31.759 --> 00:19:34.810
quark we can put two up quarks and one
down quark and I built a proton we can

00:19:34.810 --> 00:19:34.820
down quark and I built a proton we can
 

00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:37.149
down quark and I built a proton we can
put two tongue works and one up work to

00:19:37.149 --> 00:19:37.159
put two tongue works and one up work to
 

00:19:37.159 --> 00:19:40.419
put two tongue works and one up work to
build a neutron and then as you know

00:19:40.419 --> 00:19:40.429
build a neutron and then as you know
 

00:19:40.429 --> 00:19:42.700
build a neutron and then as you know
protons and neutrons they form the

00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:42.710
protons and neutrons they form the
 

00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:47.470
protons and neutrons they form the
atomic nucleus and if we then put some

00:19:47.470 --> 00:19:47.480
atomic nucleus and if we then put some
 

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:49.360
atomic nucleus and if we then put some
electrons and let them run around we

00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:49.370
electrons and let them run around we
 

00:19:49.370 --> 00:19:53.200
electrons and let them run around we
have an atom and then we just need to

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:53.210
have an atom and then we just need to
 

00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:55.600
have an atom and then we just need to
multiply this by billions and billions

00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:55.610
multiply this by billions and billions
 

00:19:55.610 --> 00:19:58.480
multiply this by billions and billions
and billions and billions in order to

00:19:58.480 --> 00:19:58.490
and billions and billions in order to
 

00:19:58.490 --> 00:20:03.669
and billions and billions in order to
build something like a planet or put

00:20:03.669 --> 00:20:03.679
build something like a planet or put
 

00:20:03.679 --> 00:20:07.060
build something like a planet or put
something like a Sun and a galaxy and

00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:07.070
something like a Sun and a galaxy and
 

00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:13.930
something like a Sun and a galaxy and
the whole universe Sophia so that was a

00:20:13.930 --> 00:20:13.940
the whole universe Sophia so that was a
 

00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:16.060
the whole universe Sophia so that was a
matter so now what about the the

00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:16.070
matter so now what about the the
 

00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:18.909
matter so now what about the the
antimatter well for every a particle

00:20:18.909 --> 00:20:18.919
antimatter well for every a particle
 

00:20:18.919 --> 00:20:21.220
antimatter well for every a particle
that we that we know that is a matter

00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:21.230
that we that we know that is a matter
 

00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:23.830
that we that we know that is a matter
particle there is a partner which is

00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:23.840
particle there is a partner which is
 

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:25.990
particle there is a partner which is
called its anti a particle so we have

00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:26.000
called its anti a particle so we have
 

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.049
called its anti a particle so we have
for a for an up quark we have an end I

00:20:29.049 --> 00:20:29.059
for a for an up quark we have an end I
 

00:20:29.059 --> 00:20:31.810
for a for an up quark we have an end I
up for an electron we have a and I

00:20:31.810 --> 00:20:31.820
up for an electron we have a and I
 

00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:33.220
up for an electron we have a and I
electron but it's actually called a

00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:33.230
electron but it's actually called a
 

00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:35.649
electron but it's actually called a
positron because it has a positive

00:20:35.649 --> 00:20:35.659
positron because it has a positive
 

00:20:35.659 --> 00:20:38.200
positron because it has a positive
charge and the electron has as you all

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:38.210
charge and the electron has as you all
 

00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:40.120
charge and the electron has as you all
know a negative charge

00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:40.130
know a negative charge
 

00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:41.530
know a negative charge
then we have a down quark and in that

00:20:41.530 --> 00:20:41.540
then we have a down quark and in that
 

00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:43.810
then we have a down quark and in that
town and an electron neutrino and an

00:20:43.810 --> 00:20:43.820
town and an electron neutrino and an
 

00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:49.600
town and an electron neutrino and an
entire electron neutrino now what's the

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:49.610
entire electron neutrino now what's the
 

00:20:49.610 --> 00:20:51.940
entire electron neutrino now what's the
difference between particles and

00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:51.950
difference between particles and
 

00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:53.680
difference between particles and
antiparticles well they have the same

00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:53.690
antiparticles well they have the same
 

00:20:53.690 --> 00:20:55.480
antiparticles well they have the same
properties so they have the same mass

00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:55.490
properties so they have the same mass
 

00:20:55.490 --> 00:20:57.370
properties so they have the same mass
the only difference is they do have

00:20:57.370 --> 00:20:57.380
the only difference is they do have
 

00:20:57.380 --> 00:20:59.620
the only difference is they do have
opposite electric charge so as I already

00:20:59.620 --> 00:20:59.630
opposite electric charge so as I already
 

00:20:59.630 --> 00:21:02.080
opposite electric charge so as I already
said the electron is negatively charged

00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:02.090
said the electron is negatively charged
 

00:21:02.090 --> 00:21:04.870
said the electron is negatively charged
and the positron is positively charged

00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:04.880
and the positron is positively charged
 

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:07.300
and the positron is positively charged
and these quarks are they have a

00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:07.310
and these quarks are they have a
 

00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:09.310
and these quarks are they have a
fractional charge so like the up quark

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:09.320
fractional charge so like the up quark
 

00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:11.830
fractional charge so like the up quark
has a plus 2/3 of the electrons at

00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:11.840
has a plus 2/3 of the electrons at
 

00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:13.840
has a plus 2/3 of the electrons at
charge and then and I up would then have

00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:13.850
charge and then and I up would then have
 

00:21:13.850 --> 00:21:17.800
charge and then and I up would then have
minus 2/3 of the of the electron charge

00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:17.810
minus 2/3 of the of the electron charge
 

00:21:17.810 --> 00:21:25.810
minus 2/3 of the of the electron charge
or well okay all right so now what what

00:21:25.810 --> 00:21:25.820
or well okay all right so now what what
 

00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:30.100
or well okay all right so now what what
happens if matter and antimatter come

00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:30.110
happens if matter and antimatter come
 

00:21:30.110 --> 00:21:35.470
happens if matter and antimatter come
close to each other so the and I Tom

00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:35.480
close to each other so the and I Tom
 

00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:38.530
close to each other so the and I Tom

look exactly the same has the same
 

00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:48.640
look exactly the same has the same
properties and if you didn't know it you

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:48.650
properties and if you didn't know it you
 

00:21:48.650 --> 00:21:50.830
properties and if you didn't know it you
know you would not know that he is made

00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:50.840
know you would not know that he is made
 

00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:54.610
know you would not know that he is made
out of antimatter the only issue is when

00:21:54.610 --> 00:21:54.620
out of antimatter the only issue is when
 

00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:57.790
out of antimatter the only issue is when
they meet when they meet what is going

00:21:57.790 --> 00:21:57.800
they meet when they meet what is going
 

00:21:57.800 --> 00:21:59.350
they meet when they meet what is going
to happen is that the matter and

00:21:59.350 --> 00:21:59.360
to happen is that the matter and
 

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:03.250

laid into energy so what Tom Hanks said

00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:08.150
laid into energy so what Tom Hanks said
 

00:22:08.150 --> 00:22:10.750
laid into energy so what Tom Hanks said
that you know this is the old threat

00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:10.760
that you know this is the old threat
 

00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:13.330

Vatican City is destroyed by light is

00:22:13.330 --> 00:22:13.340
Vatican City is destroyed by light is
 

00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:14.620
Vatican City is destroyed by light is
exactly correct

00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:14.630
exactly correct

exactly correct
the antimatter would annihilate and

00:22:17.290 --> 00:22:17.300
the antimatter would annihilate and
 

00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:20.470
the antimatter would annihilate and
release a lot of energy for example in

00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:20.480
release a lot of energy for example in
 

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:23.710
release a lot of energy for example in
forms of in form of light and this is

00:22:23.710 --> 00:22:23.720
forms of in form of light and this is
 

00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:28.300
forms of in form of light and this is
all based on the probably most famous a

00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:28.310
all based on the probably most famous a
 

00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:32.260
all based on the probably most famous a

ok so let's go back to our angels and

00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:44.870
ok so let's go back to our angels and
 

00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:47.770
ok so let's go back to our angels and
demons and the and the antimatter ok so

00:22:47.770 --> 00:22:47.780
demons and the and the antimatter ok so
 

00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:50.950
demons and the and the antimatter ok so
the story was that Rome is threatened

00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:50.960
the story was that Rome is threatened
 

00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:53.660
the story was that Rome is threatened
and it in the book it says threatened by

00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:53.670
and it in the book it says threatened by
 

00:22:53.670 --> 00:22:56.420
and it in the book it says threatened by
crumb gram of antimatter but that's

00:22:56.420 --> 00:22:56.430
crumb gram of antimatter but that's
 

00:22:56.430 --> 00:22:58.460
crumb gram of antimatter but that's
about a quarter of a $1 bill which I

00:22:58.460 --> 00:22:58.470
about a quarter of a $1 bill which I
 

00:22:58.470 --> 00:23:02.360
about a quarter of a $1 bill which I
learned has raised about one gram okay

00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:02.370
learned has raised about one gram okay
 

00:23:02.370 --> 00:23:04.940
learned has raised about one gram okay
so let's do the math here so here is a

00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:04.950
so let's do the math here so here is a
 

00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:07.340
so let's do the math here so here is a
sea squirt so we have here our quarter

00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:07.350
sea squirt so we have here our quarter
 

00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:10.850
sea squirt so we have here our quarter
gram of antimatter C is the speed of

00:23:10.850 --> 00:23:10.860
gram of antimatter C is the speed of
 

00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:12.950

light that we are need to square and

00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:12.960
light that we are need to square and
 

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:16.010
light that we are need to square and
then I put a factor of two here this

00:23:16.010 --> 00:23:16.020
then I put a factor of two here this
 

00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:20.030
then I put a factor of two here this
factor of two is is needed because the

00:23:20.030 --> 00:23:20.040
factor of two is is needed because the
 

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:22.430
factor of two is is needed because the
quarter gram of antimatter is going to

00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:22.440
quarter gram of antimatter is going to
 

00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:24.350
quarter gram of antimatter is going to
annihilate with a quarter gram of matter

00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:24.360
annihilate with a quarter gram of matter
 

00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:26.930
annihilate with a quarter gram of matter
so the total energy that is will be

00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:26.940
so the total energy that is will be
 

00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:29.900
so the total energy that is will be
released is you know a quarter gram plus

00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:29.910
released is you know a quarter gram plus
 

00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:32.210
released is you know a quarter gram plus
a quarter gram of matter and antimatter

00:23:32.210 --> 00:23:32.220
a quarter gram of matter and antimatter
 

00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:35.240
a quarter gram of matter and antimatter
and so if you are calculate this you

00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:35.250
and so if you are calculate this you
 

00:23:35.250 --> 00:23:37.160
and so if you are calculate this you
will get a forty-five at trillion this

00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:37.170
will get a forty-five at trillion this
 

00:23:37.170 --> 00:23:38.870
will get a forty-five at trillion this
is again our 10 to the 12 that we had

00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:38.880
is again our 10 to the 12 that we had
 

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:39.830
is again our 10 to the 12 that we had
before

00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:39.840

for one year well that's not really in

00:26:52.210 --> 00:26:52.220
for one year well that's not really in
 

00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:55.360
for one year well that's not really in
reality because it's colliders they do

00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:55.370
reality because it's colliders they do
 

00:26:55.370 --> 00:26:58.530

have some down times but if you do this

00:26:58.530 --> 00:26:58.540
have some down times but if you do this
 

00:26:58.540 --> 00:27:01.360
have some down times but if you do this
it well it would cost again a lot of

00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:01.370
it well it would cost again a lot of
 

00:27:01.370 --> 00:27:04.240
it well it would cost again a lot of
money but the electricity that is used

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:04.250
money but the electricity that is used
 

00:27:04.250 --> 00:27:07.480

to run the the Tevatron for for year one

00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:07.490
to run the the Tevatron for for year one
 

00:27:07.490 --> 00:27:09.940
to run the the Tevatron for for year one
year you can convert this into an

00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:09.950
year you can convert this into an
 

00:27:09.950 --> 00:27:12.580
year you can convert this into an
explosive power of several hundred kilo

00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:12.590
explosive power of several hundred kilo
 

00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:15.910
explosive power of several hundred kilo
tons so if you just used the electricity

00:27:15.910 --> 00:27:15.920
tons so if you just used the electricity
 

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:18.460
tons so if you just used the electricity
and wanted to

00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:18.470
and wanted to
 

00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:21.220
and wanted to
create a bomb with that that would be

00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:21.230
create a bomb with that that would be
 

00:27:21.230 --> 00:27:24.460
create a bomb with that that would be
quite easier way to go then to first

00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:24.470
quite easier way to go then to first
 

00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:27.250
quite easier way to go then to first
create a antimatter and then hide it

00:27:27.250 --> 00:27:27.260
create a antimatter and then hide it
 

00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:30.960
create a antimatter and then hide it
somewhere underneath the very cannon

00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:30.970
somewhere underneath the very cannon
 

00:27:30.970 --> 00:27:35.470
somewhere underneath the very cannon
okay so I thought antimatter is not

00:27:35.470 --> 00:27:35.480
okay so I thought antimatter is not
 

00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:39.549
okay so I thought antimatter is not
really a threat as I yes I think I was

00:27:39.549 --> 00:27:39.559
really a threat as I yes I think I was
 

00:27:39.559 --> 00:27:41.860
really a threat as I yes I think I was
able to show you how to create and I

00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:41.870
able to show you how to create and I
 

00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:44.649
able to show you how to create and I
matter you need much much much much much

00:27:44.649 --> 00:27:44.659
matter you need much much much much much
 

00:27:44.659 --> 00:27:48.100
matter you need much much much much much
more energy than is produced so it's

00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:48.110
more energy than is produced so it's
 

00:27:48.110 --> 00:27:50.350
more energy than is produced so it's
unfortunately also not a future energy

00:27:50.350 --> 00:27:50.360
unfortunately also not a future energy
 

00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:53.769
unfortunately also not a future energy
source because you know it takes much

00:27:53.769 --> 00:27:53.779
source because you know it takes much
 

00:27:53.779 --> 00:27:55.570
source because you know it takes much
much more energy to create the

00:27:55.570 --> 00:27:55.580
much more energy to create the
 

00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:57.669
much more energy to create the
antimatter then you is released by

00:27:57.669 --> 00:27:57.679
antimatter then you is released by
 

00:27:57.679 --> 00:28:00.700
antimatter then you is released by
letting it annihilate with real matter

00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:00.710
letting it annihilate with real matter
 

00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:02.889
letting it annihilate with real matter
so the only way to use it as an energy

00:28:02.889 --> 00:28:02.899
so the only way to use it as an energy
 

00:28:02.899 --> 00:28:06.250
so the only way to use it as an energy
source is if you found somewhere you

00:28:06.250 --> 00:28:06.260
source is if you found somewhere you
 

00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:07.870
source is if you found somewhere you
know in maybe it isn't a galaxy or

00:28:07.870 --> 00:28:07.880

antimatter then we could use it sort of

00:28:11.919 --> 00:28:11.929
antimatter then we could use it sort of
 

00:28:11.929 --> 00:28:14.860

see it's quite a complex apparatus now

00:29:01.510 --> 00:29:01.520
see it's quite a complex apparatus now
 

00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:04.120
see it's quite a complex apparatus now
maybe one day you know technology will

00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:04.130
maybe one day you know technology will
 

00:29:04.130 --> 00:29:06.700
maybe one day you know technology will
advance and one can use something like

00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:06.710
advance and one can use something like
 

00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:12.430

okay so since we reddit I thought I

00:29:17.410 --> 00:29:17.420
okay so since we reddit I thought I
 

00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:19.930
okay so since we reddit I thought I
won't think that I sort of fascinated me

00:29:19.930 --> 00:29:19.940
won't think that I sort of fascinated me
 

00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:22.000

is sort of somewhat accurate but then

00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:26.090
is sort of somewhat accurate but then
 

00:29:26.090 --> 00:29:27.610
is sort of somewhat accurate but then
there's quite a lot of science that is

00:29:27.610 --> 00:29:27.620
there's quite a lot of science that is
 

00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:30.340
there's quite a lot of science that is
not very accurate so since we reddit I

00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:30.350
not very accurate so since we reddit I
 

00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:34.090
not very accurate so since we reddit I
thought I'll discuss a few other science

00:29:34.090 --> 00:29:34.100

00:38:26.790 --> 00:38:28.340
lot of activity in the in the body now
what happens with the radioactive

00:38:28.340 --> 00:38:28.350
what happens with the radioactive
 

00:38:28.350 --> 00:38:30.590
what happens with the radioactive
substance that's attached to the sugar

00:38:30.590 --> 00:38:30.600
substance that's attached to the sugar
 

00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:34.220
substance that's attached to the sugar
molecules well it does a radioactive

00:38:34.220 --> 00:38:34.230
molecules well it does a radioactive
 

00:38:34.230 --> 00:38:37.640
molecules well it does a radioactive
decay and in this decay a positron and

00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:37.650
decay and in this decay a positron and
 

00:38:37.650 --> 00:38:40.130
decay and in this decay a positron and
antimatter particle is is released and

00:38:40.130 --> 00:38:40.140
antimatter particle is is released and
 

00:38:40.140 --> 00:38:45.140
antimatter particle is is released and
this and this positron very very quickly

00:38:45.140 --> 00:38:45.150
this and this positron very very quickly
 

00:38:45.150 --> 00:38:47.330
this and this positron very very quickly
within a smaller distance of like one

00:38:47.330 --> 00:38:47.340

millimeter finds an electron from the

00:38:50.060 --> 00:38:50.070
millimeter finds an electron from the
 

00:38:50.070 --> 00:38:53.359
millimeter finds an electron from the
surrounding tissue and annihilates with

00:38:53.359 --> 00:38:53.369
surrounding tissue and annihilates with
 

00:38:53.369 --> 00:38:56.510

eights into two into two photons and

00:38:58.910 --> 00:38:58.920
eights into two into two photons and
 

00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:01.910
eights into two into two photons and
these two photons emerge back-to-back so

00:39:01.910 --> 00:39:01.920
these two photons emerge back-to-back so
 

00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:05.630
these two photons emerge back-to-back so
but what one finds is two to the

00:39:05.630 --> 00:39:05.640
but what one finds is two to the
 

00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:07.910
but what one finds is two to the
coincidence of two photons that are

00:39:07.910 --> 00:39:07.920
coincidence of two photons that are
 

00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:10.880
coincidence of two photons that are
registered like back to back and then

00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:10.890
registered like back to back and then
 

00:39:10.890 --> 00:39:12.940
registered like back to back and then
many of these one can then create a

00:39:12.940 --> 00:39:12.950
many of these one can then create a
 

00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:15.830
many of these one can then create a
three-dimensional image where you see

00:39:15.830 --> 00:39:15.840
three-dimensional image where you see
 

00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:19.609
three-dimensional image where you see
here this is an image of a human brain

00:39:19.609 --> 00:39:19.619
here this is an image of a human brain
 

00:39:19.619 --> 00:39:22.880
here this is an image of a human brain
or here you see sort of a real a

00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:22.890
or here you see sort of a real a
 

00:39:22.890 --> 00:39:25.580
or here you see sort of a real a
three-dimensional image where there's a

00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:25.590
three-dimensional image where there's a
 

00:39:25.590 --> 00:39:31.220
three-dimensional image where there's a
lot of activity around the stomach area

00:39:31.220 --> 00:39:31.230
 

00:39:31.230 --> 00:39:34.099
then of course the other what antimatter

00:39:34.099 --> 00:39:34.109
then of course the other what antimatter
 

00:39:34.109 --> 00:39:35.870
then of course the other what antimatter
can be used for its as you heard in the

00:39:35.870 --> 00:39:35.880
can be used for its as you heard in the
 

00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:38.870

in the a certain video is to solve some

00:39:38.870 --> 00:39:38.880
in the a certain video is to solve some
 

00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:42.290
in the a certain video is to solve some
of the biggest mysteries in science so

00:39:42.290 --> 00:39:42.300
of the biggest mysteries in science so
 

00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:44.690
of the biggest mysteries in science so
this is you know what is the origin of

00:39:44.690 --> 00:39:44.700
this is you know what is the origin of
 

00:39:44.700 --> 00:39:47.960
this is you know what is the origin of
the universe why do we have a mass and

00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:47.970
the universe why do we have a mass and
 

00:39:47.970 --> 00:39:51.800
the universe why do we have a mass and
what is the universe made of and I have

00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:51.810
what is the universe made of and I have
 

00:39:51.810 --> 00:39:54.380
what is the universe made of and I have
to tell you it is not made of antimatter

00:39:54.380 --> 00:39:54.390
to tell you it is not made of antimatter
 

00:39:54.390 --> 00:39:57.620
to tell you it is not made of antimatter
now how do we know that that is some

00:39:57.620 --> 00:39:57.630
now how do we know that that is some
 

00:39:57.630 --> 00:40:02.840
now how do we know that that is some
question I can't really get into why why

00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:02.850
question I can't really get into why why
 

00:40:02.850 --> 00:40:05.030
question I can't really get into why why
there is a no antimatter in the in the

00:40:05.030 --> 00:40:05.040
there is a no antimatter in the in the
 

00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:06.710
there is a no antimatter in the in the
universe but I want to talk a little bit

00:40:06.710 --> 00:40:06.720
universe but I want to talk a little bit
 

00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:09.349
universe but I want to talk a little bit
about how come that all the antimatter

00:40:09.349 --> 00:40:09.359
about how come that all the antimatter
 

00:40:09.359 --> 00:40:12.710
about how come that all the antimatter
in the universe disappeared in order to

00:40:12.710 --> 00:40:12.720
in the universe disappeared in order to
 

00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:15.320
in the universe disappeared in order to
do that and to discuss this matter

00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:15.330
do that and to discuss this matter
 

00:40:15.330 --> 00:40:17.330
do that and to discuss this matter
antimatter asymmetry in the universe

00:40:17.330 --> 00:40:17.340
antimatter asymmetry in the universe
 

00:40:17.340 --> 00:40:20.180
antimatter asymmetry in the universe
let's sort of rewind time go very far

00:40:20.180 --> 00:40:20.190
let's sort of rewind time go very far
 

00:40:20.190 --> 00:40:22.880
let's sort of rewind time go very far
back to the to the Big Bang so we are

00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:22.890
back to the to the Big Bang so we are
 

00:40:22.890 --> 00:40:25.099
back to the to the Big Bang so we are
here at a time of 10 to the minus 43

00:40:25.099 --> 00:40:25.109
here at a time of 10 to the minus 43
 

00:40:25.109 --> 00:40:28.220

the universe is very very very very very

00:40:30.740 --> 00:40:30.750
the universe is very very very very very
 

00:40:30.750 --> 00:40:33.849
the universe is very very very very very
hot and what we have is we have

00:40:33.849 --> 00:40:33.859
hot and what we have is we have
 

00:40:33.859 --> 00:40:36.830
hot and what we have is we have
particles we have NEP particles and then

00:40:36.830 --> 00:40:36.840
particles we have NEP particles and then
 

00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:39.260
particles we have NEP particles and then
we have energy and what happens is that

00:40:39.260 --> 00:40:39.270
we have energy and what happens is that
 

00:40:39.270 --> 00:40:41.210
we have energy and what happens is that
you know the particles and other

00:40:41.210 --> 00:40:41.220
you know the particles and other
 

00:40:41.220 --> 00:40:43.040
you know the particles and other
particles and he light into our energy

00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:43.050
particles and he light into our energy
 

00:40:43.050 --> 00:40:45.680
particles and he light into our energy
and out of the energy particles and

00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:45.690
and out of the energy particles and
 

00:40:45.690 --> 00:40:47.930
and out of the energy particles and
antiparticles are created and this all

00:40:47.930 --> 00:40:47.940
antiparticles are created and this all
 

00:40:47.940 --> 00:40:51.470
antiparticles are created and this all
maintains its balance but then the the

00:40:51.470 --> 00:40:51.480
maintains its balance but then the the
 

00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:55.310
maintains its balance but then the the
universe expands and a little at time

00:40:55.310 --> 00:40:55.320
universe expands and a little at time
 

00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:57.680
universe expands and a little at time
later it's not really very much from 10

00:40:57.680 --> 00:40:57.690
later it's not really very much from 10
 

00:40:57.690 --> 00:41:01.099
later it's not really very much from 10
to the minus 43 to 10 to the minus 33

00:41:01.109 --> 00:41:02.900
to the minus 43 to 10 to the minus 33
which is sort of right after what is

00:41:02.900 --> 00:41:02.910
which is sort of right after what is
 

00:41:02.910 --> 00:41:04.609
which is sort of right after what is
called right after the inflationary

00:41:04.609 --> 00:41:04.619
called right after the inflationary
 

00:41:04.619 --> 00:41:07.040

period where the universe vents were

00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:07.050
period where the universe vents were
 

00:41:07.050 --> 00:41:11.300
period where the universe vents were
very very very rapid growth at that time

00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:11.310
very very very rapid growth at that time
 

00:41:11.310 --> 00:41:14.660
very very very rapid growth at that time
a tiny asymmetry develops between matter

00:41:14.660 --> 00:41:14.670
a tiny asymmetry develops between matter
 

00:41:14.670 --> 00:41:17.270
a tiny asymmetry develops between matter
and antimatter and this asymmetry is

00:41:17.270 --> 00:41:17.280
and antimatter and this asymmetry is
 

00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:20.810
and antimatter and this asymmetry is
very very very small like for every 10

00:41:20.810 --> 00:41:20.820
very very very small like for every 10
 

00:41:20.820 --> 00:41:25.130
very very very small like for every 10
billion and that particles there is one

00:41:25.130 --> 00:41:25.140
billion and that particles there is one
 

00:41:25.140 --> 00:41:29.840
billion and that particles there is one
more particle okay so we just have a

00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:29.850
more particle okay so we just have a
 

00:41:29.850 --> 00:41:31.580
more particle okay so we just have a
very very tiny imbalance between

00:41:31.580 --> 00:41:31.590
very very tiny imbalance between
 

00:41:31.590 --> 00:41:35.150
very very tiny imbalance between
particles and and I particles now what

00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:35.160
particles and and I particles now what
 

00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:37.480
particles and and I particles now what
happens then you know the universe keeps

00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:37.490
happens then you know the universe keeps
 

00:41:37.490 --> 00:41:41.420
happens then you know the universe keeps
expanding it further cools down which

00:41:41.420 --> 00:41:41.430
expanding it further cools down which
 

00:41:41.430 --> 00:41:43.430
expanding it further cools down which
means that the energy of the of the

00:41:43.430 --> 00:41:43.440

less and less and at some point it chops

00:41:46.970 --> 00:41:46.980
less and less and at some point it chops
 

00:41:46.980 --> 00:41:49.490
less and less and at some point it chops
be below some threshold we're out of

00:41:49.490 --> 00:41:49.500

know a quirk or an antiquark or you

00:41:54.140 --> 00:41:54.150
know a quirk or an antiquark or you
 

00:41:54.150 --> 00:41:57.079

the expansion of the universe goes on
you cannot create particles and their

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:05.010
you cannot create particles and their
 

00:42:05.010 --> 00:42:07.970
you cannot create particles and their
particles anymore but the you know the

00:42:07.970 --> 00:42:07.980
particles anymore but the you know the
 

00:42:07.980 --> 00:42:09.980
particles anymore but the you know the
anti particles and the particles that

00:42:09.980 --> 00:42:09.990
anti particles and the particles that
 

00:42:09.990 --> 00:42:11.859
anti particles and the particles that
are still there they continue to

00:42:11.859 --> 00:42:11.869
are still there they continue to
 

00:42:11.869 --> 00:42:14.990
are still there they continue to
annihilate into into a radiation and

00:42:14.990 --> 00:42:15.000
annihilate into into a radiation and
 

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:18.019
annihilate into into a radiation and
what is then left over is this tiny

00:42:18.019 --> 00:42:18.029
what is then left over is this tiny
 

00:42:18.029 --> 00:42:21.799
what is then left over is this tiny
excess of of matter which is then what

00:42:21.799 --> 00:42:21.809
excess of of matter which is then what
 

00:42:21.809 --> 00:42:23.930
excess of of matter which is then what
what we are what the universe is that

00:42:23.930 --> 00:42:23.940
what we are what the universe is that
 

00:42:23.940 --> 00:42:26.660
what we are what the universe is that
that you see out there and a lot of

about the fact that there has to be a

00:42:49.910 --> 00:42:49.920
about the fact that there has to be a
 

00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:52.609
about the fact that there has to be a
small asymmetry between a matter and

00:42:52.609 --> 00:42:52.619
small asymmetry between a matter and
 

00:42:52.619 --> 00:42:56.450
small asymmetry between a matter and
antimatter now in particle physics that

00:42:56.450 --> 00:42:56.460
antimatter now in particle physics that
 

00:42:56.460 --> 00:42:59.509
antimatter now in particle physics that
we know there is a a small symmetry that

00:42:59.509 --> 00:42:59.519
we know there is a a small symmetry that
 

00:42:59.519 --> 00:43:04.700
we know there is a a small symmetry that
was discovered in 1964 so there's an

00:43:04.700 --> 00:43:04.710
was discovered in 1964 so there's an
 

00:43:04.710 --> 00:43:06.740
was discovered in 1964 so there's an
effect that sort of breaks the symmetry

00:43:06.740 --> 00:43:06.750
effect that sort of breaks the symmetry
 

00:43:06.750 --> 00:43:08.839
effect that sort of breaks the symmetry
between matter and antimatter and we

00:43:08.839 --> 00:43:08.849
between matter and antimatter and we
 

00:43:08.849 --> 00:43:11.509
between matter and antimatter and we
call this CP violation

00:43:11.509 --> 00:43:11.519
call this CP violation
 

00:43:11.519 --> 00:43:15.259
call this CP violation

we know that the difference is very very

00:44:48.860 --> 00:44:48.870
we know that the difference is very very
 

00:44:48.870 --> 00:44:51.770
we know that the difference is very very
small and it actually turns out this

00:44:51.770 --> 00:44:51.780
small and it actually turns out this
 

00:44:51.780 --> 00:44:53.600
small and it actually turns out this

particle physics is too small and not

00:44:58.040 --> 00:44:58.050
particle physics is too small and not
 

00:44:58.050 --> 00:45:00.830
particle physics is too small and not
enough to explain the asymmetry in the

00:45:00.830 --> 00:45:00.840
enough to explain the asymmetry in the
 

00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:04.430
enough to explain the asymmetry in the
in the universe so there must be another

explanation and so what do we do well of

00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:07.170
explanation and so what do we do well of

antimatter research teams so this is

00:45:21.650 --> 00:45:21.660
antimatter research teams so this is
 

00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:24.560
antimatter research teams so this is
about some research I was involved with

00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:24.570
about some research I was involved with
 

00:45:24.570 --> 00:45:28.130
about some research I was involved with
the CDF experiment at Fermilab two years

00:45:28.130 --> 00:45:28.140
the CDF experiment at Fermilab two years
 

00:45:28.140 --> 00:45:32.060
the CDF experiment at Fermilab two years
ago and this is where we measured how a

00:45:32.060 --> 00:45:32.070
ago and this is where we measured how a
 

00:45:32.070 --> 00:45:34.820
ago and this is where we measured how a
particle turns into its anti particle

00:45:34.820 --> 00:45:34.830
particle turns into its anti particle
 

00:45:34.830 --> 00:45:36.290
particle turns into its anti particle
and it does this at a very very high

00:45:36.290 --> 00:45:36.300
and it does this at a very very high
 

00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:39.170
and it does this at a very very high
frequency like three trillion times a

00:45:39.170 --> 00:45:39.180
frequency like three trillion times a
 

00:45:39.180 --> 00:45:41.930
frequency like three trillion times a
second so this was a very important

00:45:41.930 --> 00:45:41.940
second so this was a very important
 

00:45:41.940 --> 00:45:45.110
second so this was a very important
result that actually made the New York

00:45:45.110 --> 00:45:45.120
result that actually made the New York
 

00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:48.290
result that actually made the New York

they were assembled so you see here one

00:49:56.710 --> 00:49:56.720
they were assembled so you see here one
 

00:49:56.720 --> 00:49:59.349
they were assembled so you see here one
of these wheels going down and this is

00:49:59.349 --> 00:49:59.359
of these wheels going down and this is
 

00:49:59.359 --> 00:50:02.620
of these wheels going down and this is
very habit you know arriving at the at

00:50:02.620 --> 00:50:02.630
very habit you know arriving at the at
 

00:50:02.630 --> 00:50:04.720

you see here sort of the the part of the

00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:14.210
you see here sort of the the part of the
 

00:50:14.210 --> 00:50:16.299
you see here sort of the the part of the
magnet that we had seen before now it's

00:50:16.299 --> 00:50:16.309
magnet that we had seen before now it's
 

00:50:16.309 --> 00:50:19.930
magnet that we had seen before now it's
like all cable cabled up and everything

00:50:19.930 --> 00:50:19.940
like all cable cabled up and everything
 

00:50:19.940 --> 00:50:22.450
like all cable cabled up and everything
is connected and you see here a lot of

00:50:22.450 --> 00:50:22.460
is connected and you see here a lot of
 

00:50:22.460 --> 00:50:24.989
is connected and you see here a lot of
cables so one of the things that really

00:50:24.989 --> 00:50:24.999
cables so one of the things that really
 

00:50:24.999 --> 00:50:27.999
cables so one of the things that really
impresses it me is the amount of cables

00:50:27.999 --> 00:50:28.009
impresses it me is the amount of cables
 

00:50:28.009 --> 00:50:30.370
impresses it me is the amount of cables
that come out of the experimental hall

00:50:30.370 --> 00:50:30.380
that come out of the experimental hall
 

00:50:30.380 --> 00:50:34.480
that come out of the experimental hall
it's quite impressive

00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:34.490
it's quite impressive
 

00:50:34.490 --> 00:50:40.599
it's quite impressive
okay um let's see however time yeah I'll

00:50:40.599 --> 00:50:40.609
okay um let's see however time yeah I'll
 

00:50:40.609 --> 00:50:45.490
okay um let's see however time yeah I'll
do this very quickly um so you know the

00:50:45.490 --> 00:50:45.500
do this very quickly um so you know the
 

00:50:45.500 --> 00:50:47.440
do this very quickly um so you know the
the Large Hadron Collider collides

00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:47.450
the Large Hadron Collider collides
 

00:50:47.450 --> 00:50:49.240
the Large Hadron Collider collides
particles and a lot of you know

00:50:49.240 --> 00:50:49.250
particles and a lot of you know
 

00:50:49.250 --> 00:50:51.640
particles and a lot of you know
particles are created from the energy of

00:50:51.640 --> 00:50:51.650
particles are created from the energy of
 

00:50:51.650 --> 00:50:54.820
particles are created from the energy of
the of the beam and we use this huge

00:50:54.820 --> 00:50:54.830
the of the beam and we use this huge
 

00:50:54.830 --> 00:50:57.700
the of the beam and we use this huge
experiment detect these these particles

00:50:57.700 --> 00:50:57.710
experiment detect these these particles
 

00:50:57.710 --> 00:50:59.980
experiment detect these these particles
and then try to sort of recreate what

00:50:59.980 --> 00:50:59.990
and then try to sort of recreate what
 

00:50:59.990 --> 00:51:02.230
and then try to sort of recreate what
what happens in this initial collision

00:51:02.230 --> 00:51:02.240
what happens in this initial collision
 

00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:03.880
what happens in this initial collision
so I thought I'll show you a little

00:51:03.880 --> 00:51:03.890
so I thought I'll show you a little
 

00:51:03.890 --> 00:51:06.640
so I thought I'll show you a little
animation of how we sort of detect these

00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:06.650
animation of how we sort of detect these
 

00:51:06.650 --> 00:51:09.310
animation of how we sort of detect these
different kind of particles because even

00:51:09.310 --> 00:51:09.320
different kind of particles because even
 

00:51:09.320 --> 00:51:11.020
different kind of particles because even
so there is a lot of particles that are

00:51:11.020 --> 00:51:11.030
so there is a lot of particles that are
 

00:51:11.030 --> 00:51:13.150
so there is a lot of particles that are
created most of them a decay very very

00:51:13.150 --> 00:51:13.160
created most of them a decay very very
 

00:51:13.160 --> 00:51:16.120
created most of them a decay very very
quickly like inside the the vacuum pimp

00:51:16.120 --> 00:51:16.130
quickly like inside the the vacuum pimp
 

00:51:16.130 --> 00:51:18.550
quickly like inside the the vacuum pimp
pipe and there are only a few types of

00:51:18.550 --> 00:51:18.560
pipe and there are only a few types of
 

00:51:18.560 --> 00:51:20.290
pipe and there are only a few types of
particles that actually live long enough

00:51:20.290 --> 00:51:20.300
particles that actually live long enough
 

00:51:20.300 --> 00:51:22.450
particles that actually live long enough
that they are come out of there and sort

00:51:22.450 --> 00:51:22.460
that they are come out of there and sort
 

00:51:22.460 --> 00:51:24.849
that they are come out of there and sort
of can a traverse the detector so but as

00:51:24.849 --> 00:51:24.859
of can a traverse the detector so but as
 

00:51:24.859 --> 00:51:27.400
of can a traverse the detector so but as
shown here it's like a slice a slice of

00:51:27.400 --> 00:51:27.410
shown here it's like a slice a slice of
 

00:51:27.410 --> 00:51:29.500
shown here it's like a slice a slice of
the CMS detector and it's sort of like

00:51:29.500 --> 00:51:29.510
the CMS detector and it's sort of like
 

00:51:29.510 --> 00:51:31.329
the CMS detector and it's sort of like
you know a cross-section through the

00:51:31.329 --> 00:51:31.339
you know a cross-section through the
 

00:51:31.339 --> 00:51:35.760
you know a cross-section through the
detector and so let's say we have here

00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:35.770
detector and so let's say we have here
 

00:51:35.770 --> 00:51:38.859
detector and so let's say we have here
what is called a hoops where we

00:51:38.859 --> 00:51:38.869
what is called a hoops where we
 

00:51:38.869 --> 00:51:40.930
what is called a hoops where we
but it's called charged ahead run let's

00:51:40.930 --> 00:51:40.940
but it's called charged ahead run let's
 

00:51:40.940 --> 00:51:44.349
but it's called charged ahead run let's
say it charged okay sorry

00:51:44.349 --> 00:51:44.359
say it charged okay sorry
 

00:51:44.359 --> 00:51:46.030
say it charged okay sorry
so there are different detector

00:51:46.030 --> 00:51:46.040
so there are different detector
 

00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:47.890
so there are different detector
components so here is sort of what is

00:51:47.890 --> 00:51:47.900
components so here is sort of what is
 

00:51:47.900 --> 00:51:50.530
components so here is sort of what is
called a a tracker so this is something

00:51:50.530 --> 00:51:50.540
called a a tracker so this is something
 

00:51:50.540 --> 00:51:52.240
called a a tracker so this is something
if a particle a charged particle goes

00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:52.250
if a particle a charged particle goes
 

00:51:52.250 --> 00:51:54.070
if a particle a charged particle goes
through it at least is it leaves some

00:51:54.070 --> 00:51:54.080
through it at least is it leaves some
 

00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:56.560
through it at least is it leaves some
tracks there this is here what we call a

00:51:56.560 --> 00:51:56.570
tracks there this is here what we call a
 

00:51:56.570 --> 00:51:58.960
tracks there this is here what we call a
color emitter and it comes in two

00:51:58.960 --> 00:51:58.970
color emitter and it comes in two
 

00:51:58.970 --> 00:52:01.000
color emitter and it comes in two
variants a hetero neck color emitter and

00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:01.010
variants a hetero neck color emitter and
 

00:52:01.010 --> 00:52:03.220
variants a hetero neck color emitter and
electromagnetic calorimeter and you will

00:52:03.220 --> 00:52:03.230
electromagnetic calorimeter and you will
 

00:52:03.230 --> 00:52:05.200
electromagnetic calorimeter and you will
see in a moment what they are good for

00:52:05.200 --> 00:52:05.210
see in a moment what they are good for
 

00:52:05.210 --> 00:52:07.750
see in a moment what they are good for
this is the the magnet and then there

00:52:07.750 --> 00:52:07.760
this is the the magnet and then there
 

00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:12.640
this is the the magnet and then there
are some chambers out here that are

00:52:12.640 --> 00:52:12.650
are some chambers out here that are
 

00:52:12.650 --> 00:52:14.650
are some chambers out here that are
called immune chambers that I used to I

00:52:14.650 --> 00:52:14.660
called immune chambers that I used to I
 

00:52:14.660 --> 00:52:17.530
called immune chambers that I used to I
detect these muons the partners of the

00:52:17.530 --> 00:52:17.540
detect these muons the partners of the
 

00:52:17.540 --> 00:52:20.680
detect these muons the partners of the
of the of the electron okay so let's see

00:52:20.680 --> 00:52:20.690
of the of the electron okay so let's see
 

00:52:20.690 --> 00:52:22.450
of the of the electron okay so let's see
what happens if there is a charged a

00:52:22.450 --> 00:52:22.460
what happens if there is a charged a
 

00:52:22.460 --> 00:52:24.550
what happens if there is a charged a
hadron coming out of the initial

00:52:24.550 --> 00:52:24.560
hadron coming out of the initial
 

00:52:24.560 --> 00:52:28.030
hadron coming out of the initial
collision so what you see here is

00:52:28.030 --> 00:52:28.040
collision so what you see here is
 

00:52:28.040 --> 00:52:30.190
collision so what you see here is
several things first you see here this

00:52:30.190 --> 00:52:30.200
several things first you see here this
 

00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:33.310
several things first you see here this
it it loses most of its energy here in

00:52:33.310 --> 00:52:33.320
it it loses most of its energy here in
 

00:52:33.320 --> 00:52:36.280
it it loses most of its energy here in
this hadron a kilometer and it sort of

00:52:36.280 --> 00:52:36.290
this hadron a kilometer and it sort of
 

00:52:36.290 --> 00:52:39.160
this hadron a kilometer and it sort of
creates new particles and which are sort

00:52:39.160 --> 00:52:39.170
creates new particles and which are sort
 

00:52:39.170 --> 00:52:41.859
creates new particles and which are sort
of all recorded here the other thing

00:52:41.859 --> 00:52:41.869
of all recorded here the other thing
 

00:52:41.869 --> 00:52:45.640
of all recorded here the other thing
that you see is it gives some traces

00:52:45.640 --> 00:52:45.650
that you see is it gives some traces
 

00:52:45.650 --> 00:52:48.069
that you see is it gives some traces
here in this in this tracker

00:52:48.069 --> 00:52:48.079
here in this in this tracker
 

00:52:48.079 --> 00:52:49.569
here in this in this tracker
and the other thing that you see is it

00:52:49.569 --> 00:52:49.579
and the other thing that you see is it
 

00:52:49.579 --> 00:52:52.419
and the other thing that you see is it
the the the the pass of this a particle

00:52:52.419 --> 00:52:52.429
the the the the pass of this a particle
 

00:52:52.429 --> 00:52:54.429
the the the the pass of this a particle
is a curved and this is because it's a

00:52:54.429 --> 00:52:54.439
is a curved and this is because it's a
 

00:52:54.439 --> 00:52:55.870
is a curved and this is because it's a
charged particle in a magnetic field

00:52:55.870 --> 00:52:55.880
charged particle in a magnetic field
 

00:52:55.880 --> 00:53:00.160
charged particle in a magnetic field
always goes on a curved trajectory so if

00:53:00.160 --> 00:53:00.170
always goes on a curved trajectory so if
 

00:53:00.170 --> 00:53:03.249
always goes on a curved trajectory so if
we have then a neutral Hedren you will

00:53:03.249 --> 00:53:03.259
we have then a neutral Hedren you will
 

00:53:03.259 --> 00:53:06.429
we have then a neutral Hedren you will
probably very quickly see what the

00:53:06.429 --> 00:53:06.439
probably very quickly see what the
 

00:53:06.439 --> 00:53:07.959
probably very quickly see what the
difference is well the only difference

00:53:07.959 --> 00:53:07.969
difference is well the only difference
 

00:53:07.969 --> 00:53:10.209
difference is well the only difference
is it again you know loses all its

00:53:10.209 --> 00:53:10.219
is it again you know loses all its
 

00:53:10.219 --> 00:53:12.039
is it again you know loses all its
energy here in this pattern kilometer

00:53:12.039 --> 00:53:12.049
energy here in this pattern kilometer
 

00:53:12.049 --> 00:53:14.709
energy here in this pattern kilometer
but since it's a neutral it that it's it

00:53:14.709 --> 00:53:14.719
but since it's a neutral it that it's it
 

00:53:14.719 --> 00:53:16.479
but since it's a neutral it that it's it
just goes straight through and it does

00:53:16.479 --> 00:53:16.489
just goes straight through and it does
 

00:53:16.489 --> 00:53:20.380
just goes straight through and it does
not make any traces here in this trekker

00:53:20.380 --> 00:53:20.390
not make any traces here in this trekker
 

00:53:20.390 --> 00:53:26.229
not make any traces here in this trekker
component now if we take an electron so

00:53:26.229 --> 00:53:26.239
component now if we take an electron so
 

00:53:26.239 --> 00:53:28.419
component now if we take an electron so
electrons again a charge so it's a

00:53:28.419 --> 00:53:28.429
electrons again a charge so it's a
 

00:53:28.429 --> 00:53:30.459
electrons again a charge so it's a
curved a trajectory and the electron

00:53:30.459 --> 00:53:30.469
curved a trajectory and the electron
 

00:53:30.469 --> 00:53:31.929
curved a trajectory and the electron
loses all its energy in this

00:53:31.929 --> 00:53:31.939
loses all its energy in this
 

00:53:31.939 --> 00:53:34.179
loses all its energy in this
electromagnetic kilometer where the

00:53:34.179 --> 00:53:34.189
electromagnetic kilometer where the
 

00:53:34.189 --> 00:53:38.319
electromagnetic kilometer where the
Hadron adjust event went through now a

00:53:38.319 --> 00:53:38.329
Hadron adjust event went through now a
 

00:53:38.329 --> 00:53:41.709
Hadron adjust event went through now a
photon that we had talked about it is

00:53:41.709 --> 00:53:41.719
photon that we had talked about it is
 

00:53:41.719 --> 00:53:44.620
photon that we had talked about it is
sort of behaves like an electron it also

00:53:44.620 --> 00:53:44.630
sort of behaves like an electron it also
 

00:53:44.630 --> 00:53:49.329
sort of behaves like an electron it also
loses all its energy in the in this in

00:53:49.329 --> 00:53:49.339
loses all its energy in the in this in
 

00:53:49.339 --> 00:53:50.709
loses all its energy in the in this in
the electromagnetic color matter but

00:53:50.709 --> 00:53:50.719
the electromagnetic color matter but
 

00:53:50.719 --> 00:53:52.479
the electromagnetic color matter but
it's neutral so it goes just right

00:53:52.479 --> 00:53:52.489
it's neutral so it goes just right
 

00:53:52.489 --> 00:53:55.269
it's neutral so it goes just right
through and then finally we have these

00:53:55.269 --> 00:53:55.279
through and then finally we have these
 

00:53:55.279 --> 00:53:59.259
through and then finally we have these
neurons and they are charged so they are

00:53:59.259 --> 00:53:59.269
neurons and they are charged so they are
 

00:53:59.269 --> 00:54:01.630
neurons and they are charged so they are
on a curved track they go all through

00:54:01.630 --> 00:54:01.640
on a curved track they go all through
 

00:54:01.640 --> 00:54:03.459
on a curved track they go all through
the kilometer so they are not impacted

00:54:03.459 --> 00:54:03.469
the kilometer so they are not impacted
 

00:54:03.469 --> 00:54:06.219
the kilometer so they are not impacted
by that but then they leave a traces

00:54:06.219 --> 00:54:06.229
by that but then they leave a traces
 

00:54:06.229 --> 00:54:08.499
by that but then they leave a traces
here in these chambers that are out here

00:54:08.499 --> 00:54:08.509
here in these chambers that are out here
 

00:54:08.509 --> 00:54:10.689
here in these chambers that are out here
and just we call them a muon chambers

00:54:10.689 --> 00:54:10.699
and just we call them a muon chambers
 

00:54:10.699 --> 00:54:12.099
and just we call them a muon chambers
and you also see that you know it's

00:54:12.099 --> 00:54:12.109
and you also see that you know it's
 

00:54:12.109 --> 00:54:15.279
and you also see that you know it's
curved one way this here and one way out

00:54:15.279 --> 00:54:15.289
curved one way this here and one way out
 

00:54:15.289 --> 00:54:17.620
curved one way this here and one way out
here because there are two a magnetic

00:54:17.620 --> 00:54:17.630
here because there are two a magnetic
 

00:54:17.630 --> 00:54:19.299
here because there are two a magnetic
fields and they are opposite polarity

00:54:19.299 --> 00:54:19.309
fields and they are opposite polarity
 

00:54:19.309 --> 00:54:22.229
fields and they are opposite polarity
and so they go in a different direction

00:54:22.229 --> 00:54:22.239
and so they go in a different direction
 

00:54:22.239 --> 00:54:28.969
and so they go in a different direction
okay

00:54:28.969 --> 00:54:28.979
 

00:54:28.979 --> 00:54:33.089
all right so the next picture I wanted

00:54:33.089 --> 00:54:33.099
all right so the next picture I wanted
 

00:54:33.099 --> 00:54:34.650
all right so the next picture I wanted
to show you is to talk a little bit

00:54:34.650 --> 00:54:34.660
to show you is to talk a little bit
 

00:54:34.660 --> 00:54:38.609
to show you is to talk a little bit
about the science because I knew correct

00:54:38.609 --> 00:54:38.619
about the science because I knew correct
 

00:54:38.619 --> 00:54:41.160
about the science because I knew correct
would mention the dark matter so I

00:54:41.160 --> 00:54:41.170
would mention the dark matter so I
 

00:54:41.170 --> 00:54:43.259
would mention the dark matter so I
wanted to talk about a little bit about

00:54:43.259 --> 00:54:43.269
wanted to talk about a little bit about
 

00:54:43.269 --> 00:54:46.380
wanted to talk about a little bit about
that what do you see here well you see a

00:54:46.380 --> 00:54:46.390
that what do you see here well you see a
 

00:54:46.390 --> 00:54:49.440
that what do you see here well you see a
lot of where stars this is what is

00:54:49.440 --> 00:54:49.450
lot of where stars this is what is
 

00:54:49.450 --> 00:54:52.430
lot of where stars this is what is
called a Hubble ultra-deep field

00:54:52.430 --> 00:54:52.440
called a Hubble ultra-deep field
 

00:54:52.440 --> 00:54:55.319
called a Hubble ultra-deep field
exposure so this is a very very long

00:54:55.319 --> 00:54:55.329
exposure so this is a very very long
 

00:54:55.329 --> 00:54:57.089
exposure so this is a very very long
exposure taking with the Hubble Space

00:54:57.089 --> 00:54:57.099
exposure taking with the Hubble Space
 

00:54:57.099 --> 00:55:00.930
exposure taking with the Hubble Space
Telescope of a very very small part of

00:55:00.930 --> 00:55:00.940
Telescope of a very very small part of
 

00:55:00.940 --> 00:55:03.059
Telescope of a very very small part of
the sky it's like three arc minutes by

00:55:03.059 --> 00:55:03.069
the sky it's like three arc minutes by
 

00:55:03.069 --> 00:55:04.620
the sky it's like three arc minutes by
three arc minutes so this is really like

00:55:04.620 --> 00:55:04.630
three arc minutes so this is really like
 

00:55:04.630 --> 00:55:08.039
three arc minutes so this is really like
a tiny amount of the sky which is sort

00:55:08.039 --> 00:55:08.049
a tiny amount of the sky which is sort
 

00:55:08.049 --> 00:55:09.749
a tiny amount of the sky which is sort
of less than one millionth of you know

00:55:09.749 --> 00:55:09.759
of less than one millionth of you know
 

00:55:09.759 --> 00:55:12.359
of less than one millionth of you know
all this guy that is you know 4pi or all

00:55:12.359 --> 00:55:12.369
all this guy that is you know 4pi or all
 

00:55:12.369 --> 00:55:15.479
all this guy that is you know 4pi or all
around us now you can count how many

00:55:15.479 --> 00:55:15.489
around us now you can count how many
 

00:55:15.489 --> 00:55:17.969
around us now you can count how many
galaxies you you see here if you do that

00:55:17.969 --> 00:55:17.979
galaxies you you see here if you do that
 

00:55:17.979 --> 00:55:20.150
galaxies you you see here if you do that
you will count about maybe ten thousand

00:55:20.150 --> 00:55:20.160
you will count about maybe ten thousand
 

00:55:20.160 --> 00:55:23.549
you will count about maybe ten thousand
now we know each galaxy has about a

00:55:23.549 --> 00:55:23.559
now we know each galaxy has about a
 

00:55:23.559 --> 00:55:26.999
now we know each galaxy has about a
hundred billions of Suns in it and so

00:55:26.999 --> 00:55:27.009
hundred billions of Suns in it and so
 

00:55:27.009 --> 00:55:29.400
hundred billions of Suns in it and so
you can sort of quite easily then

00:55:29.400 --> 00:55:29.410
you can sort of quite easily then
 

00:55:29.410 --> 00:55:32.279
you can sort of quite easily then
calculate how many Suns are out there in

00:55:32.289 --> 00:55:33.900
calculate how many Suns are out there in
the universe you will get to a number of

00:55:33.900 --> 00:55:33.910
the universe you will get to a number of
 

00:55:33.910 --> 00:55:36.930
the universe you will get to a number of
something like ten to z22 to 10 to the

something like ten to z22 to 10 to the
 

00:55:36.940 --> 00:55:39.630
something like ten to z22 to 10 to the

00:55:39.630 --> 00:55:39.640
23 and if we sort of take you know the
 

00:55:39.640 --> 00:55:42.059
23 and if we sort of take you know the
average you know mass of our Sun you

average you know mass of our Sun you
 

00:55:42.069 --> 00:55:44.940
average you know mass of our Sun you
will get you know a gigantic number of

00:56:07.049 --> 00:56:07.059
dark matter that we heard about and then
 

00:56:07.059 --> 00:56:09.690
dark matter that we heard about and then
more than a 70% of the universe is made

more than a 70% of the universe is made
 

00:56:09.700 --> 00:56:11.430
more than a 70% of the universe is made
out of something that we call a dark

what this what this really is I want to

00:56:20.609 --> 00:56:20.619
what this what this really is I want to
 

00:56:20.619 --> 00:56:23.670
what this what this really is I want to
quickly illustrate a little bit to you

00:56:23.670 --> 00:56:23.680
quickly illustrate a little bit to you
 

00:56:23.680 --> 00:56:26.969
quickly illustrate a little bit to you
so you know this dark matter it's a

00:56:26.969 --> 00:56:26.979
so you know this dark matter it's a
 

00:56:26.979 --> 00:56:28.769
so you know this dark matter it's a
called a dark matter because we cannot

00:56:28.769 --> 00:56:28.779
called a dark matter because we cannot
 

00:56:28.779 --> 00:56:30.719
called a dark matter because we cannot
see it so it means it doesn't are shined

00:56:30.719 --> 00:56:30.729
see it so it means it doesn't are shined
 

00:56:30.729 --> 00:56:33.359
see it so it means it doesn't are shined
like like a Sun so how do we know that

00:56:33.359 --> 00:56:33.369
like like a Sun so how do we know that
 

00:56:33.369 --> 00:56:37.140
like like a Sun so how do we know that
it actually is really out there and one

00:56:37.140 --> 00:56:37.150
it actually is really out there and one
 

00:56:37.150 --> 00:56:39.509
it actually is really out there and one
one evidence for the existence of dark

00:56:39.509 --> 00:56:39.519
one evidence for the existence of dark
 

00:56:39.519 --> 00:56:41.700
one evidence for the existence of dark
matter is illustrated here

00:56:41.700 --> 00:56:41.710
matter is illustrated here
 

00:56:41.710 --> 00:56:44.280
matter is illustrated here
this is what's called a rotational

00:56:44.280 --> 00:56:44.290
this is what's called a rotational
 

00:56:44.290 --> 00:56:49.339
this is what's called a rotational
velocity of galaxies so what what we

00:56:49.339 --> 00:56:49.349
velocity of galaxies so what what we
 

00:56:49.349 --> 00:56:52.349
velocity of galaxies so what what we
they want the person who were first sort

00:56:52.349 --> 00:56:52.359
they want the person who were first sort
 

00:56:52.359 --> 00:56:55.980
they want the person who were first sort
of discovered dark matter was a Fritz

00:56:55.980 --> 00:56:55.990
of discovered dark matter was a Fritz
 

00:56:55.990 --> 00:56:59.280
of discovered dark matter was a Fritz
Zwicky in the 1930s and he made

00:56:59.280 --> 00:56:59.290
Zwicky in the 1930s and he made
 

00:56:59.290 --> 00:57:01.940
Zwicky in the 1930s and he made
measurements of the of the velocity of

00:57:01.940 --> 00:57:01.950
measurements of the of the velocity of
 

00:57:01.950 --> 00:57:08.940
measurements of the of the velocity of
of stars in galaxies and so you know if

00:57:08.940 --> 00:57:08.950
of stars in galaxies and so you know if
 

00:57:08.950 --> 00:57:10.859
of stars in galaxies and so you know if
you sort of roll something around like

00:57:10.859 --> 00:57:10.869
you sort of roll something around like
 

00:57:10.869 --> 00:57:15.510
you sort of roll something around like
like a shot put the faster you go you

00:57:15.510 --> 00:57:15.520
like a shot put the faster you go you
 

00:57:15.520 --> 00:57:18.270
like a shot put the faster you go you
have to hold the more so because it's a

00:57:18.270 --> 00:57:18.280
have to hold the more so because it's a
 

00:57:18.280 --> 00:57:20.700
have to hold the more so because it's a
centrifugal force that once you know the

00:57:20.700 --> 00:57:20.710
centrifugal force that once you know the
 

00:57:20.710 --> 00:57:24.150
centrifugal force that once you know the
short put do it to fly away so now the

00:57:24.150 --> 00:57:24.160
short put do it to fly away so now the
 

00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:26.550
short put do it to fly away so now the
force that holds this galaxies together

00:57:26.550 --> 00:57:26.560
force that holds this galaxies together
 

00:57:26.560 --> 00:57:29.070
force that holds this galaxies together
is of course the gravitational force of

00:57:29.070 --> 00:57:29.080
is of course the gravitational force of
 

00:57:29.080 --> 00:57:32.190
is of course the gravitational force of
all the of all the stars that make up

00:57:32.190 --> 00:57:32.200
all the of all the stars that make up
 

00:57:32.200 --> 00:57:36.690
all the of all the stars that make up
this galaxy and so what was observed is

00:57:36.690 --> 00:57:36.700
this galaxy and so what was observed is
 

00:57:36.700 --> 00:57:39.720
this galaxy and so what was observed is
that the the stars out here in the in

00:57:39.720 --> 00:57:39.730
that the the stars out here in the in
 

00:57:39.730 --> 00:57:44.250
that the the stars out here in the in
the galaxies they they rotate way too

00:57:44.250 --> 00:57:44.260
the galaxies they they rotate way too
 

00:57:44.260 --> 00:57:48.180
the galaxies they they rotate way too
fast with this if the if the mass of the

00:57:48.180 --> 00:57:48.190
fast with this if the if the mass of the
 

00:57:48.190 --> 00:57:50.400
fast with this if the if the mass of the
galaxy just came from the mass of the

00:57:50.400 --> 00:57:50.410
galaxy just came from the mass of the
 

00:57:50.410 --> 00:57:53.670
galaxy just came from the mass of the
stars that hold this together you know

00:57:53.670 --> 00:57:53.680
stars that hold this together you know
 

00:57:53.680 --> 00:57:55.560
stars that hold this together you know
the the galaxy itself would sort of tear

00:57:55.560 --> 00:57:55.570
the the galaxy itself would sort of tear
 

00:57:55.570 --> 00:57:57.570
the the galaxy itself would sort of tear
itself apart and sort of just you know

00:57:57.570 --> 00:57:57.580
itself apart and sort of just you know
 

00:57:57.580 --> 00:58:02.160
itself apart and sort of just you know
fly and yeah tear itself apart so there

00:58:02.160 --> 00:58:02.170
fly and yeah tear itself apart so there
 

00:58:02.170 --> 00:58:04.140
fly and yeah tear itself apart so there
has to be more mass in this in this

00:58:04.140 --> 00:58:04.150
has to be more mass in this in this
 

00:58:04.150 --> 00:58:06.599
has to be more mass in this in this
galaxy and this more mass is what is our

00:58:06.599 --> 00:58:06.609
galaxy and this more mass is what is our
 

00:58:06.609 --> 00:58:11.579
galaxy and this more mass is what is our
dark matter okay

00:58:11.579 --> 00:58:11.589
dark matter okay
 

00:58:11.589 --> 00:58:14.670
dark matter okay
Dargis because we can't detect it and

00:58:14.670 --> 00:58:14.680
Dargis because we can't detect it and
 

00:58:14.680 --> 00:58:17.400
Dargis because we can't detect it and
but as I said we sort of can tell that

00:58:17.400 --> 00:58:17.410
but as I said we sort of can tell that
 

00:58:17.410 --> 00:58:18.990
but as I said we sort of can tell that
it's there from the effect that it has

00:58:18.990 --> 00:58:19.000
it's there from the effect that it has
 

00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:23.690
it's there from the effect that it has
on galaxies and it could be made out of

00:58:23.690 --> 00:58:23.700
on galaxies and it could be made out of
 

00:58:23.700 --> 00:58:24.870
on galaxies and it could be made out of

00:58:24.870 --> 00:58:24.880
undiscovered
 

00:58:24.880 --> 00:58:26.550
undiscovered
particles I'm not going to explain the

00:58:26.550 --> 00:58:26.560
particles I'm not going to explain the
 

00:58:26.560 --> 00:58:30.329
particles I'm not going to explain the
the picture here I want to sort of use

00:58:30.329 --> 00:58:30.339
the picture here I want to sort of use
 

00:58:30.339 --> 00:58:33.720
the picture here I want to sort of use
my remaining a few minutes to talk a

00:58:33.720 --> 00:58:33.730
my remaining a few minutes to talk a
 

00:58:33.730 --> 00:58:36.240
my remaining a few minutes to talk a
little bit about the connection between

00:58:36.240 --> 00:58:36.250
little bit about the connection between
 

00:58:36.250 --> 00:58:40.099
little bit about the connection between
dark matter and enter a particle physics

00:58:40.099 --> 00:58:40.109
dark matter and enter a particle physics
 

00:58:40.109 --> 00:58:43.710
dark matter and enter a particle physics
so particles can be candidates of dark

00:58:43.710 --> 00:58:43.720
so particles can be candidates of dark
 

00:58:43.720 --> 00:58:45.480
so particles can be candidates of dark
matter and so of course the first

00:58:45.480 --> 00:58:45.490
matter and so of course the first
 

00:58:45.490 --> 00:58:47.339
matter and so of course the first
thought that you have is you know all

00:58:47.339 --> 00:58:47.349
thought that you have is you know all
 

00:58:47.349 --> 00:58:49.050
thought that you have is you know all
the particles that we know about the

00:58:49.050 --> 00:58:49.060
the particles that we know about the
 

00:58:49.060 --> 00:58:50.780
the particles that we know about the
quarks and the leptons and neutrinos

00:58:50.780 --> 00:58:50.790
quarks and the leptons and neutrinos
 

00:58:50.790 --> 00:58:53.730
quarks and the leptons and neutrinos
maybe they could be this dark matter

00:58:53.730 --> 00:58:53.740
maybe they could be this dark matter
 

00:58:53.740 --> 00:58:55.440
maybe they could be this dark matter
well it turns out

00:58:55.440 --> 00:58:55.450
well it turns out
 

00:58:55.450 --> 00:58:57.510
well it turns out
that is not possible because their

00:58:57.510 --> 00:58:57.520
that is not possible because their
 

00:58:57.520 --> 00:59:00.570
that is not possible because their
masses are too too small especially the

00:59:00.570 --> 00:59:00.580
masses are too too small especially the
 

00:59:00.580 --> 00:59:03.660
masses are too too small especially the
neutrinos who were a candidate at some

00:59:03.660 --> 00:59:03.670
neutrinos who were a candidate at some
 

00:59:03.670 --> 00:59:06.630
neutrinos who were a candidate at some
point their masses is way too small to

00:59:06.630 --> 00:59:06.640
point their masses is way too small to
 

00:59:06.640 --> 00:59:08.670
point their masses is way too small to
make up the amount of dark matter that

00:59:08.670 --> 00:59:08.680
make up the amount of dark matter that
 

00:59:08.680 --> 00:59:12.540
make up the amount of dark matter that
is needed so a most prominent a

00:59:12.540 --> 00:59:12.550
is needed so a most prominent a
 

00:59:12.550 --> 00:59:14.700
is needed so a most prominent a
candidate is a particle that we do not

00:59:14.700 --> 00:59:14.710
candidate is a particle that we do not
 

00:59:14.710 --> 00:59:18.300
candidate is a particle that we do not
yet know about it and this candidate is

00:59:18.300 --> 00:59:18.310
yet know about it and this candidate is
 

00:59:18.310 --> 00:59:22.470
yet know about it and this candidate is
comes from a new theory which is called

00:59:22.470 --> 00:59:22.480
comes from a new theory which is called
 

00:59:22.480 --> 00:59:25.590
comes from a new theory which is called
supersymmetry now supersymmetry is

00:59:25.590 --> 00:59:25.600
supersymmetry now supersymmetry is
 

00:59:25.600 --> 00:59:30.690
supersymmetry now supersymmetry is
symmetry between fermions and bosons now

00:59:30.690 --> 00:59:30.700
symmetry between fermions and bosons now
 

00:59:30.700 --> 00:59:33.510
symmetry between fermions and bosons now
what are fermions and bosons so these

00:59:33.510 --> 00:59:33.520
what are fermions and bosons so these
 

00:59:33.520 --> 00:59:36.000
what are fermions and bosons so these
particles in addition to having like you

00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:36.010
particles in addition to having like you
 

00:59:36.010 --> 00:59:38.310
particles in addition to having like you
know something like a charge they also

00:59:38.310 --> 00:59:38.320
know something like a charge they also
 

00:59:38.320 --> 00:59:40.500
know something like a charge they also
have something what we call spin which

00:59:40.500 --> 00:59:40.510
have something what we call spin which
 

00:59:40.510 --> 00:59:42.270
have something what we call spin which
you can really imagine as like you know

00:59:42.270 --> 00:59:42.280
you can really imagine as like you know
 

00:59:42.280 --> 00:59:44.060
you can really imagine as like you know
the particle just whirls around and

00:59:44.060 --> 00:59:44.070
the particle just whirls around and
 

00:59:44.070 --> 00:59:47.820
the particle just whirls around and
spins around now in quantum mechanics as

00:59:47.820 --> 00:59:47.830
spins around now in quantum mechanics as
 

00:59:47.830 --> 00:59:53.850
spins around now in quantum mechanics as
you know a lot of a lot of quantities

00:59:53.850 --> 00:59:53.860
you know a lot of a lot of quantities
 

00:59:53.860 --> 00:59:57.030
you know a lot of a lot of quantities
are quantized so they are discrete so

00:59:57.030 --> 00:59:57.040
are quantized so they are discrete so
 

00:59:57.040 --> 01:00:00.630
are quantized so they are discrete so
these spins they come either as a an

01:00:00.630 --> 01:00:00.640
these spins they come either as a an
 

01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:02.730
these spins they come either as a an
integer number of the unit that they are

01:00:02.730 --> 01:00:02.740
integer number of the unit that they are
 

01:00:02.740 --> 01:00:04.710
integer number of the unit that they are
measured for which is Planck's constant

01:00:04.710 --> 01:00:04.720
measured for which is Planck's constant
 

01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:07.560
measured for which is Planck's constant
or they come in half integers so there

01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:07.570
or they come in half integers so there
 

01:00:07.570 --> 01:00:09.570
or they come in half integers so there
are particles that have a spin of 0 or 1

01:00:09.570 --> 01:00:09.580
are particles that have a spin of 0 or 1
 

01:00:09.580 --> 01:00:12.660
are particles that have a spin of 0 or 1
or 2 and we call them bosons and then

01:00:12.660 --> 01:00:12.670
or 2 and we call them bosons and then
 

01:00:12.670 --> 01:00:14.040
or 2 and we call them bosons and then
they're particles of where they are spin

01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:14.050
they're particles of where they are spin
 

01:00:14.050 --> 01:00:15.720
they're particles of where they are spin
off one half or three half and we call

01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:15.730
off one half or three half and we call
 

01:00:15.730 --> 01:00:18.540
off one half or three half and we call
them fermions and now it turns out most

01:00:18.540 --> 01:00:18.550
them fermions and now it turns out most
 

01:00:18.550 --> 01:00:21.240
them fermions and now it turns out most
of the particles that we have talked

01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:21.250
of the particles that we have talked
 

01:00:21.250 --> 01:00:23.670
of the particles that we have talked
about are quarks and our electrons they

01:00:23.670 --> 01:00:23.680
about are quarks and our electrons they
 

01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:26.730
about are quarks and our electrons they
are a fermions with a spin of 1/2 then

01:00:26.730 --> 01:00:26.740
are a fermions with a spin of 1/2 then
 

01:00:26.740 --> 01:00:28.410
are a fermions with a spin of 1/2 then
they're particles that we haven't really

01:00:28.410 --> 01:00:28.420
they're particles that we haven't really
 

01:00:28.420 --> 01:00:31.260
they're particles that we haven't really
talked about is which are the the ones

01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:31.270
talked about is which are the the ones
 

01:00:31.270 --> 01:00:34.170
talked about is which are the the ones
that mediate the different forces that

01:00:34.170 --> 01:00:34.180
that mediate the different forces that
 

01:00:34.180 --> 01:00:36.750
that mediate the different forces that
that we know and they are bosons and so

01:00:36.750 --> 01:00:36.760
that we know and they are bosons and so
 

01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:39.330
that we know and they are bosons and so
this supersymmetry postulates that for

01:00:39.330 --> 01:00:39.340
this supersymmetry postulates that for
 

01:00:39.340 --> 01:00:42.540
this supersymmetry postulates that for
every particle in our standard model

01:00:42.540 --> 01:00:42.550
every particle in our standard model
 

01:00:42.550 --> 01:00:43.860
every particle in our standard model
there is a partner particle a

01:00:43.860 --> 01:00:43.870
there is a partner particle a
 

01:00:43.870 --> 01:00:46.860
there is a partner particle a
supersymmetric particle and these

01:00:46.860 --> 01:00:46.870
supersymmetric particle and these
 

01:00:46.870 --> 01:00:49.740
supersymmetric particle and these
supersymmetric particles you know they

01:00:49.740 --> 01:00:49.750
supersymmetric particles you know they
 

01:00:49.750 --> 01:00:52.380
supersymmetric particles you know they
were created in the in the Big Bang they

01:00:52.380 --> 01:00:52.390
were created in the in the Big Bang they
 

01:00:52.390 --> 01:00:53.700
were created in the in the Big Bang they
existed you know in the very very early

01:00:53.700 --> 01:00:53.710
existed you know in the very very early
 

01:00:53.710 --> 01:00:57.230
existed you know in the very very early
universe when it was very very hot and

01:00:57.230 --> 01:00:57.240
universe when it was very very hot and
 

01:00:57.240 --> 01:00:59.730
universe when it was very very hot and
as we know you know the heavy particles

01:00:59.730 --> 01:00:59.740
as we know you know the heavy particles
 

01:00:59.740 --> 01:01:02.040
as we know you know the heavy particles
are usually decay into lighter ones and

01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:02.050
are usually decay into lighter ones and
 

01:01:02.050 --> 01:01:04.050
are usually decay into lighter ones and
then in the end there is one particle

01:01:04.050 --> 01:01:04.060
then in the end there is one particle
 

01:01:04.060 --> 01:01:05.820
then in the end there is one particle
that is going to be a leftover and this

01:01:05.820 --> 01:01:05.830
that is going to be a leftover and this
 

01:01:05.830 --> 01:01:08.359
that is going to be a leftover and this
is the lightest supersymmetric particle

01:01:08.359 --> 01:01:08.369
is the lightest supersymmetric particle
 

01:01:08.369 --> 01:01:11.450
is the lightest supersymmetric particle
and that is could be all the dark matter

01:01:11.450 --> 01:01:11.460
and that is could be all the dark matter
 

01:01:11.460 --> 01:01:15.880
and that is could be all the dark matter
that is out there in the universe and

01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:15.890
that is out there in the universe and
 

01:01:15.890 --> 01:01:18.470
that is out there in the universe and
these dark matter particles could for

01:01:18.470 --> 01:01:18.480
these dark matter particles could for
 

01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:20.809
these dark matter particles could for
example be produced at an accelerator

01:01:20.809 --> 01:01:20.819
example be produced at an accelerator
 

01:01:20.819 --> 01:01:22.910
example be produced at an accelerator
like the Large Hadron Collider there's

01:01:22.910 --> 01:01:22.920
like the Large Hadron Collider there's
 

01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:25.579
like the Large Hadron Collider there's
actually a good reason that the energy

01:01:25.579 --> 01:01:25.589
actually a good reason that the energy
 

01:01:25.589 --> 01:01:27.499
actually a good reason that the energy
at which the Large Hadron Collider will

01:01:27.499 --> 01:01:27.509
at which the Large Hadron Collider will
 

01:01:27.509 --> 01:01:30.289
at which the Large Hadron Collider will
operate that it will sort of produce

01:01:30.289 --> 01:01:30.299
operate that it will sort of produce
 

01:01:30.299 --> 01:01:32.059
operate that it will sort of produce
dark matter particles so this is

01:01:32.059 --> 01:01:32.069
dark matter particles so this is
 

01:01:32.069 --> 01:01:33.910
dark matter particles so this is
something that I'm interested in and

01:01:33.910 --> 01:01:33.920
something that I'm interested in and
 

01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:38.120
something that I'm interested in and
want to study very briefly to sort of

01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:38.130
want to study very briefly to sort of
 

01:01:38.130 --> 01:01:42.620
want to study very briefly to sort of
wrap this up last year September at

01:01:42.620 --> 01:01:42.630
wrap this up last year September at
 

01:01:42.630 --> 01:01:46.759
wrap this up last year September at
10:00 was the official start of CFC

01:01:46.759 --> 01:01:46.769
10:00 was the official start of CFC
 

01:01:46.769 --> 01:01:50.599
10:00 was the official start of CFC
Large Hadron Collider Google changed on

01:01:50.599 --> 01:01:50.609
Large Hadron Collider Google changed on
 

01:01:50.609 --> 01:01:52.579
Large Hadron Collider Google changed on
this day actually it's a logo to

01:01:52.579 --> 01:01:52.589
this day actually it's a logo to
 

01:01:52.589 --> 01:01:55.640
this day actually it's a logo to
something that resembles a Collider so

01:01:55.640 --> 01:01:55.650
something that resembles a Collider so
 

01:01:55.650 --> 01:01:57.620
something that resembles a Collider so
that was at a birth oh the first beams

01:01:57.620 --> 01:01:57.630
that was at a birth oh the first beams
 

01:01:57.630 --> 01:01:59.749
that was at a birth oh the first beams
went through the through the Large

01:01:59.749 --> 01:01:59.759
went through the through the Large
 

01:01:59.759 --> 01:02:01.880
went through the through the Large
Hadron Collider and they were sort of

01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:01.890
Hadron Collider and they were sort of
 

01:02:01.890 --> 01:02:04.130
Hadron Collider and they were sort of
just a dump and then there were a lot of

01:02:04.130 --> 01:02:04.140
just a dump and then there were a lot of
 

01:02:04.140 --> 01:02:05.870
just a dump and then there were a lot of
particles that sort of splash back and

01:02:05.870 --> 01:02:05.880
particles that sort of splash back and
 

01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:07.430
particles that sort of splash back and
these are some images from the CMS

01:02:07.430 --> 01:02:07.440
these are some images from the CMS
 

01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:11.359
these are some images from the CMS
experiment now you might have heard very

01:02:11.359 --> 01:02:11.369
experiment now you might have heard very
 

01:02:11.369 --> 01:02:15.739
experiment now you might have heard very
soon after that there was a accident at

01:02:15.739 --> 01:02:15.749
soon after that there was a accident at
 

01:02:15.749 --> 01:02:20.630
soon after that there was a accident at
the at the LHC that was sort of a kind

01:02:20.630 --> 01:02:20.640
the at the LHC that was sort of a kind
 

01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:22.579
the at the LHC that was sort of a kind
of an explosion which resulted from a

01:02:22.579 --> 01:02:22.589
of an explosion which resulted from a
 

01:02:22.589 --> 01:02:26.319
of an explosion which resulted from a
lot of liquid helium that was released

01:02:26.319 --> 01:02:26.329
lot of liquid helium that was released
 

01:02:26.329 --> 01:02:29.979
lot of liquid helium that was released
and so the the accelerator right now is

01:02:29.979 --> 01:02:29.989
and so the the accelerator right now is
 

01:02:29.989 --> 01:02:33.410
and so the the accelerator right now is
it's a repair is being repaired and this

01:02:33.410 --> 01:02:33.420
it's a repair is being repaired and this
 

01:02:33.420 --> 01:02:36.799
it's a repair is being repaired and this
is a delay for doing the physics so the

01:02:36.799 --> 01:02:36.809
is a delay for doing the physics so the
 

01:02:36.809 --> 01:02:40.220
is a delay for doing the physics so the
the magnets are right now replaced so

01:02:40.220 --> 01:02:40.230
the magnets are right now replaced so
 

01:02:40.230 --> 01:02:42.380
the magnets are right now replaced so
they had to replace about 50 magnets

01:02:42.380 --> 01:02:42.390
they had to replace about 50 magnets
 

01:02:42.390 --> 01:02:45.579
they had to replace about 50 magnets
which is not very much compared to the

01:02:45.579 --> 01:02:45.589
which is not very much compared to the
 

01:02:45.589 --> 01:02:48.140
which is not very much compared to the
1232 a magnets but you know it takes

01:02:48.140 --> 01:02:48.150
1232 a magnets but you know it takes
 

01:02:48.150 --> 01:02:50.029
1232 a magnets but you know it takes
some time to bring them up and down and

01:02:50.029 --> 01:02:50.039
some time to bring them up and down and
 

01:02:50.039 --> 01:02:51.979
some time to bring them up and down and
to now cable it all up and so the

01:02:51.979 --> 01:02:51.989
to now cable it all up and so the
 

01:02:51.989 --> 01:02:55.069
to now cable it all up and so the
program will resume in the late in the

01:02:55.069 --> 01:02:55.079
program will resume in the late in the
 

01:02:55.079 --> 01:02:59.960
program will resume in the late in the
late summer so I thought I'll stop I'll

01:02:59.960 --> 01:02:59.970
late summer so I thought I'll stop I'll
 

01:02:59.970 --> 01:03:03.349
late summer so I thought I'll stop I'll
end here with something so what do

01:03:03.349 --> 01:03:03.359
end here with something so what do
 

01:03:03.359 --> 01:03:06.440
end here with something so what do
physicists do in the mean time so I'll

01:03:06.440 --> 01:03:06.450
physicists do in the mean time so I'll
 

01:03:06.450 --> 01:03:09.440
physicists do in the mean time so I'll
give you a little idea here let's see

01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:09.450
give you a little idea here let's see
 

01:03:09.450 --> 01:03:14.180
give you a little idea here let's see
whether this works good morning and may

01:03:14.180 --> 01:03:14.190
whether this works good morning and may
 

01:03:14.190 --> 01:03:17.680
whether this works good morning and may
I welcome you on this auspicious day to

01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:17.690
I welcome you on this auspicious day to
 

01:03:17.690 --> 01:03:21.340
I welcome you on this auspicious day to
serve where we have the coffee expresso

01:03:21.340 --> 01:03:21.350
serve where we have the coffee expresso
 

01:03:21.350 --> 01:03:35.670
serve where we have the coffee expresso
research machine

01:03:35.670 --> 01:03:35.680
 

01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:41.040
well what we're hoping to do today is to

01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:41.050
well what we're hoping to do today is to
 

01:03:41.050 --> 01:03:45.420
well what we're hoping to do today is to
take hundreds and hundreds of volts

01:03:45.420 --> 01:03:45.430
take hundreds and hundreds of volts
 

01:03:45.430 --> 01:03:48.330
take hundreds and hundreds of volts
electricity and pass it through this

01:03:48.330 --> 01:03:48.340
electricity and pass it through this
 

01:03:48.340 --> 01:03:51.060
electricity and pass it through this
cable this thing goes deep into the

01:03:51.060 --> 01:03:51.070
cable this thing goes deep into the
 

01:03:51.070 --> 01:03:53.570
cable this thing goes deep into the
center of the machine where there is a

01:03:53.570 --> 01:03:53.580
center of the machine where there is a
 

01:03:53.580 --> 01:03:57.690
center of the machine where there is a
superheated coil we will then take water

01:03:57.690 --> 01:03:57.700
superheated coil we will then take water
 

01:03:57.700 --> 01:04:03.150
superheated coil we will then take water
and pump it through the superheated coil

01:04:03.150 --> 01:04:03.160
and pump it through the superheated coil
 

01:04:03.160 --> 01:04:07.260
and pump it through the superheated coil
at tremendous speeds tremendous speeds

01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:07.270
at tremendous speeds tremendous speeds
 

01:04:07.270 --> 01:04:10.890
at tremendous speeds tremendous speeds
and then what we're hoping to do is to

01:04:10.890 --> 01:04:10.900
and then what we're hoping to do is to
 

01:04:10.900 --> 01:04:15.600
and then what we're hoping to do is to
get a water particle to collide with a

01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:15.610
get a water particle to collide with a
 

01:04:15.610 --> 01:04:21.660
get a water particle to collide with a
coffee granule we were hoping we believe

01:04:21.660 --> 01:04:21.670
coffee granule we were hoping we believe
 

01:04:21.670 --> 01:04:24.900
coffee granule we were hoping we believe
that if we can get this collision to

01:04:24.900 --> 01:04:24.910
that if we can get this collision to
 

01:04:24.910 --> 01:04:27.210
that if we can get this collision to
take place in the collision chamber here

01:04:27.210 --> 01:04:27.220
take place in the collision chamber here
 

01:04:27.220 --> 01:04:32.190
take place in the collision chamber here
that we will actually create an express

01:04:32.190 --> 01:04:32.200
that we will actually create an express
 

01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:34.280
that we will actually create an express
them

01:04:34.280 --> 01:04:34.290
them
 

01:04:34.290 --> 01:04:45.230
them
I'll now just turn it on

01:04:45.230 --> 01:04:45.240
 

01:04:45.240 --> 01:05:05.060
hey it doesn't seem to work

01:05:05.060 --> 01:05:05.070
 

01:05:05.070 --> 01:05:09.450
all right thank you very much
