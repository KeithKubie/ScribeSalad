00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:15.037
The development and spread of railroads

00:00:15.037 --> 00:00:16.274
across the United States

00:00:16.274 --> 00:00:19.149
brought a wave of changes to American life.

00:00:19.149 --> 00:00:20.312
During the railroad boom,

00:00:20.312 --> 00:00:22.308
thousands of jobs were created,

00:00:22.308 --> 00:00:23.565
new towns were born,

00:00:23.565 --> 00:00:25.088
trade increased,

00:00:25.088 --> 00:00:26.570
transportation was faster,

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.857
and the overall landscape of the nation transformed.

00:00:29.857 --> 00:00:31.890
But, perhaps the most interesting change of all

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.448
is the least known:

00:00:33.448 --> 00:00:35.646
the establishment of standard time.

00:00:35.646 --> 00:00:39.394
Today, we know if it is 6:28 a.m. in Los Angeles,

00:00:39.394 --> 00:00:41.479
it is 9:28 a.m. in New York,

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:43.435
2:28 p.m. in London,

00:00:43.435 --> 00:00:45.322
5:28 p.m. in Moscow,

00:00:45.322 --> 00:00:47.816
and 10:28 p.m in Tokyo.

00:00:47.816 --> 00:00:48.868
No matter where you are,

00:00:48.868 --> 00:00:51.284
the minute and second are the exact same.

00:00:51.284 --> 00:00:52.698
But, before the railroads,

00:00:52.698 --> 00:00:55.284
there was no need for a national or global clock,

00:00:55.284 --> 00:00:57.942
and each town kept its own local time.

00:00:57.942 --> 00:00:59.789
So when it was 12 noon in Chicago,

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.362
it was 12:07 p.m. in Indianapolis,

00:01:02.362 --> 00:01:04.369
11:50 a.m. in St. Louis,

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:06.786
and 11:27 a.m. in Omaha.

00:01:06.786 --> 00:01:09.212
This worked just fine when the only modes of travel

00:01:09.212 --> 00:01:10.797
were horses or steamboats,

00:01:10.797 --> 00:01:12.635
but it became incredibly problematic

00:01:12.635 --> 00:01:14.308
when railroads came along.

00:01:14.308 --> 00:01:15.666
How can you keep a train schedule

00:01:15.666 --> 00:01:17.932
when each town has its own time?

00:01:17.932 --> 00:01:20.693
And how do you prevent collisions or accidents on the tracks

00:01:20.693 --> 00:01:23.408
if train conductors are using different clocks?

00:01:23.408 --> 00:01:26.980
It doesn't really make sense to leave a station at 12:14 p.m.,

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:28.743
travel for 22 minutes,

00:01:28.743 --> 00:01:31.529
and arrive at 12:31 p.m.

00:01:31.529 --> 00:01:33.120
In order to eliminate that confusion,

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.054
the railroads of the United States and Canada

00:01:35.054 --> 00:01:36.558
instituted standard time zones

00:01:36.558 --> 00:01:39.757
on November 18, 1883 at noon.

00:01:39.757 --> 00:01:41.164
It allowed the railroad companies

00:01:41.164 --> 00:01:42.559
to operate more effectively

00:01:42.559 --> 00:01:44.631
and reduce deadly accidents.

00:01:44.631 --> 00:01:45.918
The American public, however,

00:01:45.918 --> 00:01:48.671
was not so quick to embrace this new change,

00:01:48.671 --> 00:01:51.463
as many cities continued to use their own local time.

00:01:51.463 --> 00:01:54.174
Resistance was so strong that, in some towns,

00:01:54.174 --> 00:01:58.576
clocks would show both the local time and the railway time.

00:01:58.576 --> 00:02:00.099
Imagine this conversation:

00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:02.277
"Pardon me, sir. Do you have the time?"

00:02:02.277 --> 00:02:04.052
"Why yes, which do you need?

00:02:04.052 --> 00:02:08.157
It's 12:13 local time and 12:16 railway time."

00:02:08.157 --> 00:02:11.367
Ultimately, the logic of keeping a standard time prevailed,

00:02:11.367 --> 00:02:14.787
and the United States government made time zones a matter of law

00:02:14.787 --> 00:02:18.162
with the Standard Time Act of March 19, 1918.

00:02:18.162 --> 00:02:20.286
Since then, there have been numerous changes

00:02:20.286 --> 00:02:21.545
to the time zones,

00:02:21.545 --> 00:02:24.553
but the concept of standard time has remained.

00:02:24.553 --> 00:02:27.101
But, the United States was actually not the first

00:02:27.101 --> 00:02:28.844
to develop standard time.

00:02:28.844 --> 00:02:31.214
The first company to implement the use of standard time

00:02:31.214 --> 00:02:34.931
was the Great Western Railway in 1840 in Britain,

00:02:34.931 --> 00:02:38.101
and by 1847, most British railways were using

00:02:38.101 --> 00:02:41.154
Greenwich Mean Time, or G.M.T.

00:02:41.154 --> 00:02:42.939
The British government made it official

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:47.446
on August 2, 1880 with the Statutes, or Definition of Time, Act.

00:02:47.446 --> 00:02:49.238
But, while Britain may have been the first

00:02:49.238 --> 00:02:50.540
to establish standard time,

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.077
it is Asia and the islands of the South Pacific

00:02:53.077 --> 00:02:55.981
that enjoyed the first hour of each new day.

00:02:55.981 --> 00:02:57.397
The International Date Line

00:02:57.397 --> 00:02:58.874
passes through the Pacific Ocean

00:02:58.874 --> 00:03:00.424
on the opposite side of the Earth

00:03:00.424 --> 00:03:02.832
from the Prime Meridian in Greenwich where,

00:03:02.832 --> 00:03:03.990
thanks to trains,

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:06.597
standard time was first used.

00:03:06.597 --> 00:03:08.071
Trains have evolved over the years

00:03:08.071 --> 00:03:09.306
and remain a prominent form

00:03:09.306 --> 00:03:11.646
of transportation and trade throughout the world.

00:03:11.646 --> 00:03:13.179
And, from the New York City subways

00:03:13.179 --> 00:03:15.917
to the freight trains traveling across the Great Plains,

00:03:15.917 --> 00:03:18.102
to the trolleys in San Francisco,

00:03:18.102 --> 00:03:20.853
they all know exactly what time it is.

00:03:20.853 --> 00:03:23.357
And, thanks to them, we do too!
