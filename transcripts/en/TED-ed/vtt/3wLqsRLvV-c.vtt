00:00:06.999 --> 00:00:09.034
What is consciousness?

00:00:09.034 --> 00:00:11.828
Can an artificial machine really think?

00:00:11.828 --> 00:00:15.114
Does the mind just consist of neurons
in the brain,

00:00:15.114 --> 00:00:18.757
or is there some intangible spark
at its core?

00:00:18.757 --> 00:00:21.325
For many, these have been
vital considerations

00:00:21.325 --> 00:00:24.352
for the future of artificial intelligence.

00:00:24.352 --> 00:00:29.539
But British computer scientist Alan Turing
decided to disregard all these questions

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:31.850
in favor of a much simpler one:

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.269
can a computer talk like a human?

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:39.265
This question led to an idea for measuring
aritificial intelligence

00:00:39.265 --> 00:00:43.316
that would famously come to be known
as the Turing test.

00:00:43.316 --> 00:00:47.341
In the 1950 paper, "Computing Machinery
and Intelligence,"

00:00:47.341 --> 00:00:49.814
Turing proposed the following game.

00:00:49.814 --> 00:00:53.906
A human judge has a text conversation
with unseen players

00:00:53.906 --> 00:00:56.382
and evaluates their responses.

00:00:56.382 --> 00:01:00.409
To pass the test, a computer must
be able to replace one of the players

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:03.857
without substantially 
changing the results.

00:01:03.857 --> 00:01:06.816
In other words, a computer would be
considered intelligent

00:01:06.816 --> 00:01:12.513
if its conversation couldn't be easily
distinguished from a human's.

00:01:12.513 --> 00:01:14.667
Turing predicted that by the year 2000,

00:01:14.667 --> 00:01:20.622
machines with 100 megabytes of memory
would be able to easily pass his test.

00:01:20.622 --> 00:01:22.786
But he may have jumped the gun.

00:01:22.786 --> 00:01:25.840
Even though today's computers
have far more memory than that,

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.643
few have succeeded,

00:01:27.643 --> 00:01:29.438
and those that have done well

00:01:29.438 --> 00:01:33.208
focused more on finding clever ways
to fool judges

00:01:33.208 --> 00:01:36.174
than using overwhelming computing power.

00:01:36.174 --> 00:01:39.096
Though it was never subjected
to a real test,

00:01:39.096 --> 00:01:43.865
the first program with 
some claim to success was called ELIZA.

00:01:43.865 --> 00:01:46.412
With only a fairly short 
and simple script,

00:01:46.412 --> 00:01:50.434
it managed to mislead many people
by mimicking a psychologist,

00:01:50.434 --> 00:01:52.395
encouraging them to talk more

00:01:52.395 --> 00:01:55.905
and reflecting their own questions
back at them.

00:01:55.905 --> 00:01:59.412
Another early script PARRY
took the opposite approach

00:01:59.412 --> 00:02:02.213
by imitating a paranoid schizophrenic

00:02:02.213 --> 00:02:07.939
who kept steering the conversation
back to his own preprogrammed obsessions.

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:12.803
Their success in fooling people
highlighted one weakness of the test.

00:02:12.803 --> 00:02:17.433
Humans regularly attribute intelligence
to a whole range of things

00:02:17.433 --> 00:02:21.076
that are not actually intelligent.

00:02:21.076 --> 00:02:24.289
Nonetheless, annual competitions
like the Loebner Prize,

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:26.009
have made the test more formal

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:28.155
with judges knowing ahead of time

00:02:28.155 --> 00:02:32.019
that some of their conversation partners 
are machines.

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:33.920
But while the quality has improved,

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:39.096
many chatbot programmers have used
similar strategies to ELIZA and PARRY.

00:02:39.096 --> 00:02:41.132
1997's winner Catherine

00:02:41.132 --> 00:02:45.213
could carry on amazingly focused 
and intelligent conversation,

00:02:45.213 --> 00:02:49.175
but mostly if the judge wanted
to talk about Bill Clinton.

00:02:49.175 --> 00:02:51.813
And the more recent winner
Eugene Goostman

00:02:51.813 --> 00:02:55.549
was given the persona of a
13-year-old Ukrainian boy,

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:59.570
so judges interpreted its nonsequiturs
and awkward grammar

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:02.916
as language and culture barriers.

00:03:02.916 --> 00:03:07.135
Meanwhile, other programs like Cleverbot
have taken a different approach

00:03:07.135 --> 00:03:11.740
by statistically analyzing huge databases
of real conversations

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:14.281
to determine the best responses.

00:03:14.281 --> 00:03:17.530
Some also store memories 
of previous conversations

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.915
in order to improve over time.

00:03:20.915 --> 00:03:25.066
But while Cleverbot's individual responses
can sound incredibly human,

00:03:25.066 --> 00:03:27.092
its lack of a consistent personality

00:03:27.092 --> 00:03:30.245
and inability to deal 
with brand new topics

00:03:30.245 --> 00:03:32.858
are a dead giveaway.

00:03:32.858 --> 00:03:36.112
Who in Turing's day could have predicted
that today's computers

00:03:36.112 --> 00:03:38.201
would be able to pilot spacecraft,

00:03:38.201 --> 00:03:40.518
perform delicate surgeries,

00:03:40.518 --> 00:03:42.807
and solve massive equations,

00:03:42.807 --> 00:03:46.310
but still struggle with 
the most basic small talk?

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.819
Human language turns out to be
an amazingly complex phenomenon

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:53.524
that can't be captured by even
the largest dictionary.

00:03:53.524 --> 00:03:57.993
Chatbots can be baffled by simple pauses,
like "umm..."

00:03:57.993 --> 00:04:00.415
or questions with no correct answer.

00:04:00.415 --> 00:04:02.315
And a simple conversational sentence,

00:04:02.315 --> 00:04:05.595
like, "I took the juice out of the fridge
and gave it to him,

00:04:05.595 --> 00:04:07.406
but forgot to check the date,"

00:04:07.406 --> 00:04:12.872
requires a wealth of underlying knowledge
and intuition to parse.

00:04:12.872 --> 00:04:15.503
It turns out that simulating 
a human conversation

00:04:15.503 --> 00:04:19.112
takes more than just increasing
memory and processing power,

00:04:19.112 --> 00:04:21.623
and as we get closer to Turing's goal,

00:04:21.623 --> 00:04:26.483
we may have to deal with all those big
questions about consciousness after all.
