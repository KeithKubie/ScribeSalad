00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.290
Italy birthed ballet, France helped codify its terminology, but it’s Russia that

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.860
made this style of movement synonymous with its identity.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.860
If you look at a lot of the principal dancers a lot of the dancers in the company, they're either

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:19.700
had Russian teachers. They had Russian training. Russia has been en pointe when

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.460
it comes to fanciful footwork. While in
the United States ballet is seen as

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.050
entertainment for the elites, in Russia
it's mainstream culture. During the Cold

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.859
War, America used popular culture to
spread its views with things like movies

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.489
and television. The Soviet Union
countered with high culture in the form

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.329
of music and ballet. The role of ballet
in Russian culture has always been one

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.450
that's connected to the government.
It's not just something people do

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.370
or companies have done, but rather that
this has become something that's seen as

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.800
deeply connected to political power.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.320
Hey, fam. I'm Imaeyen and this Sunday we're strutting to beat outside of our regular studio

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.100
and telling you how Russia forever changed ballet.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.020
Why has ballet become synonymous with
Russia and Russians? Because we are the great.

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.530
Anton Pankevich knows ballet because it's been his entire life.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.180
There's literally a book on him. The
Russian-born Stanford University

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.729
instructor has spent a lot of time on
his toes, using relevé, rond de jambe,

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.650
and plié to have his body articulate what
words cannot. In the neoclassical ballet

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:41.640
we tried to make of figures that not
necessarily human. You can portray an

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.570
animal. You can portray a tree. You can
portray many different things. Pankevich

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.740
put on his first pair of ballet shoes at
age 10, and in doing so he stepped into

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.990
Russia's decades-long tradition of
ballet dominance. They always put so much

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.310
emphasis on culture. Culture 
was extremely important to Russia -- culture

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.920
and sport. Those are the ones that were their bread and butter, and they always

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.690
succeeded in culture. So many think of
ballet as a Russian art form, but it was

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.500
actually the Italians who invented the
dance in the 15th century during the

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.670
Renaissance period. Ballet was how the
European royalty entertained itself, says

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.170
dance historian  Lynn Garafola. They were
not public performances. There were no

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.180
stages. There wasn't a public theater, but rather it was something that's exclusively for the court.

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.720
The first dancers
didn't wear the tutus or the pointe

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.670
shoes we've come to associate with the
art today. And the language, words like

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:38.370
Barre, Pirouette and port de bras. It comes from the French who adopted ballet

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:39.920
shortly after its creation.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.920
Ballet didn't arrive to the United States until the 1900s, which is centuries after it began.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:55.079
Its arrival coincided with a large wave of Russians immigrating to the U.S. after the Russian Imperial government was

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:59.310
overthrown, and years of civil war
followed. Russia nearly abandoned ballet

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.480
following 1917 Bolshevik Revolution.
That upheaval eventually birthed the

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.500
Soviet Union and a communist party that
would rule the nation for decades.

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.000
In the revolt's aftermath, the powers that be tried to destroy what they saw as the

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.110
trappings of the aristocracy. Revolution leader Lenin had

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:18.860
originally intended to close the
theaters, but peasants and farmers kept

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.730
filling the audiences for the ballet.
After the Revolution the number of

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:27.740
Russians from the ballet world of Moscow and St. Petersburg but also many other

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:30.160
places increased enormously.

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:39.520
Since the Russian people wanted ballet and opera, the famous Bolshoi Theatre was saved. As the Russian Empire died and the Soviet

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.220
Union began more than two million people fled the country, and that number

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.190
includes more than 30,000 people who
came to the United States to escape

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:51.460
repression and the police state. Many of
those people were aristocrats and professionals.

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:52.500
 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:01.500
In fact the Mariinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg lost a huge number of people after the Revolution and many of

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:06.560
them later turned up all around the world
from San Francisco with a huge valley-

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.390
centered community in Paris. New York
also had any number of people. Those

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:16.519
artists may have escaped Russia, but they
didn't escape her very watchful eye. You

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:19.880
have to realize this was during the
height of the Cold War. The U.S. and the

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.320
Soviet Union were two world powers with
drastically differing ideologies. And the

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.100
close watch the Soviets kept on their
dances is just one example of their

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:32.060
contrasts. You were being constantly
watched, then you had to worry about what

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:39.140
happened afterwards. And the parents, the colleagues, the fellow dancers, family --all

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:43.310
of these would be subjected to
surveillance and threats by the secret

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:48.110
police and by the political authorities,
sometimes years before a dancer would be

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:53.390
able to talk to his or her mother, for instance, or someone close. But even

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:57.110
when you did you knew that someone was listening to the phone conversation.

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:01.130
Coming to America wasn't easy for Soviet
ballet dancers, but the outcome of all of

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.970
Russia's unrest did forever change the
art in the United States. It's Russian

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:08.450
choreographer George Balanchine who
became the father of the American ballet

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:13.190
when he co-founded the School of
American Ballet in 1934. Russia's Ballet

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:16.190
Russe tour sparked an American
interest in the dance and Russian

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:19.640
defectors began to share their training.
Today you can enroll in ballet class

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:24.020
just about anywhere in the U.S. If it
wasn't for Balanchine

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:25.760
I don't think ballet would have been as popular

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:31.100
in America. Russian ballet has
influenced pretty much I believe all of

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:36.500
American dancing. The Soviet connection is clear - it's in the execution where Pankevich

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:40.520
says you'll see the difference. He
compared the two styles to a car race.

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:45.890
It's like watching Indy 500 versus
Formula One. Which one's Indy, which

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:50.990
one's Formula One? Indy is American. Formula One is the European. So Formula

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:55.300
One, you have the fastest technology in
the world and you have the most amazing

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:59.600
races, what they have. In Indy they
just go in a circle. Look at the

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:04.880
difference in the speed of the footwork.
On the left is the Russian way and on

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:10.370
the right is the American way. The Soviet Union is also the reason

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:15.800
ballet saw an increase in the quality of
male dancers. The Soviet early on had

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:22.400
decided had put a premium on the quality
of male dancing. And so many of the roles

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:28.160
were increased, augmented, new variations,
new solos would be added and it was this

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:31.520
tradition of male dancing that the
Soviets brought to the west and

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:35.870
electrified people. Mikhail Baryshnikov
is one of the Soviets most famous male

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:39.290
dancers. He's considered one of the
greatest ballet dancers in history and

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:44.480
he's actually the pre-eminent male
dancer of the 1970s and the 1980s. At a

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:47.840
time when one of the only ways Soviets
could see the world was through touring

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:51.830
with the arts, Baryshnikov wowed
international audiences with his ability.

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:57.050
And in June 1974 he wowed them with his defection from the Soviet Union. It was a

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:01.070
big deal. Yes,
ballet is about strength and beauty, but

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:05.780
for the Soviets it was also about power.
Their art was a way to try and persuade

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:10.130
people to the Soviet worldview without
force or coercion. In this way Soviet

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:13.040
dancers introducing their style to a
global audience was a sort of propaganda --

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:18.350
in the same way the West also used soft
power, like having the CIA back abstract

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:22.130
expressionist painters like Jackson
Pollock, or producing movies like James

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:24.740
Bond which cast the Soviets as the bad guys.

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:27.000
[movie excerpt] "As he pits his murderous talents against the Iron Curtain."

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.700
I believe the Soviets felt
that this was one way of encountering

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:35.270
what was the vast American influence
abroad and what essentially America

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:39.599
exported, although
certainly didn't do so consciously, and

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:45.080
this led of course to a wonderful period
of touring by Soviet companies.

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:53.340
So this couldn't have happened in the U.S. without the Soviets because they essentially

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:57.240
created the American version of ballet.
Pankevich believes Russia will continue to

00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:00.449
dominate ballet because of the amount of
monetary resources the government

00:08:00.449 --> 00:08:05.220
contributes to sustain the art. And for
him, the most difficult part of ballet isn't

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:09.300
securing the funding. I would say the
most difficult thing about ballet is

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:14.909
letting go. You have certain memories
that you remember how you look. It's hard

00:08:14.909 --> 00:08:19.710
to let it go because you have a certain
memory. Just don't dwell on the past

00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:23.660
and try to share your memory with the
dancers.

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:33.419
 

00:08:33.419 --> 00:08:36.800
 

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:41.310
 

00:08:41.310 --> 00:08:45.169
