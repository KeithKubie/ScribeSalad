00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.420
- Thank you very much.

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.720
It's a pleasure being here.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:10.926
I was told by one of
the fellow fellows

00:00:10.926 --> 00:00:12.800
yesterday, or two days
ago, that I don't even

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.090
understand your title.

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:16.940
So have no fear.

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:18.920
It was a bit of a
challenge as a chemist

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.290
because I'm so used to
talking with structures.

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:23.540
Structures, and the
beauty of structures,

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:26.700
is really a part of what gets
us excited about chemistry.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.760
But I've cut out a
lot of structures

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.150
in the hopes of giving
you a sense for what

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:32.900
are some of the key
problems that chemists

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.550
are trying to solve.

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.320
How does my group
go about trying

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.930
to solve a specific
aspect in this larger

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:40.065
picture of chemistry?

00:00:40.065 --> 00:00:42.440
And then, I also want to give
you a little bit of a sense

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.620
for how does an organic
chemist think about problems?

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.770
How do we approach the world?

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:49.760
And so first, I
really, really want

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.830
to thank the Daniels family.

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.470
So when Judy called
me up last year

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.020
and told me this news
of my fellowship,

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.750
I had the challenge of
explaining this to my parents.

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.990
So my dad worked
in textile plants.

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:03.632
My mom in home
construction sites.

00:01:03.632 --> 00:01:05.090
And so the fact
that their daughter

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:07.220
was going to get paid just
to think for nine months

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.470
was a little bit mind blowing.

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.370
Sort of magical
like a fairy tale.

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.080
So I really want to thank
the Daniels family here

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.890
for endowing this fellowship
to enable this fairytale.

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.440
And hope their generosity
and vision really

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.420
inspires a lot of
people beyond me too.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.840
So with that, I'd like
to start, and give you

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.850
a sense of first
of all, how is it

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.230
that we've gotten therapeutics?

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:29.660
Things to treat disease?

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.380
Historically, humans have gotten
this from plants and things

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:34.650
in their environment.

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.440
So we'll for example, chew
on birch bark or willow bark

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.800
to extract an aspirin-like
component from that.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.630
As you can imagine,
getting something

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.100
from a natural
source, it's always

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.590
dicey as to how much of
that compound is actually

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.480
in the source.

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:55.040
And so, in the late
1800s, chemists

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.530
started figuring out
ways of generating

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.070
these compounds in pure
form, and to make something

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.450
like aspirin.

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.700
And many of the
therapeutics that you

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.650
might be familiar
with beyond aspirin

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.389
that you might
buy at a pharmacy,

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:11.030
are what we call small
molecule therapeutics.

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.550
These are relatively
small compounds.

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.830
Many of them were inspired
by natural products

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.630
from various sources.

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.240
And they've been
really changing the way

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.575
that we can treat disease.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.640
So in the course
of these studies,

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.460
and really going back
to the early 1900s,

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.470
with the isolation of insulin--

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.850
that protein-- the small 51
amino acid peptide or protein

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.850
from the pancreas, we realized
that there was actually

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:43.030
some larger molecules that
could also be therapeutically

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.870
interesting and vital.

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.540
So many of the
newer therapeutics,

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.570
including vaccines as well as
all these monoclonal antibody

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.150
therapies you may hear
about in the news now,

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.280
are based on what's called
recombinant DNA technology.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.280
And I'll describe that
in a little bit of detail

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.080
in the next two slides.

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.420
And these are known
as biotherapeutics.

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.880
These are quite a bit larger
than the small molecule

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.600
therapies that chemists have
been synthesizing or extracting

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.047
from natural sources.

00:03:09.047 --> 00:03:10.630
And these are known
as biotherapeutics

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.700
even when they are chemically
modified in some way.

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.700
And this is actually the
fastest growing sector

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.160
of the pharmaceutical industry
now is biotherapeutics

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.570
for various reasons.

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.810
And interestingly, in 2014,
the World Health Organization

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.770
identified increased access
to the biotherapeutic products

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:28.330
as a global health priority.

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.880
So not just small molecule
therapies, but also

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.280
these much larger molecules.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.940
Now, this is a challenge
from a chemistry standpoint.

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.350
So we started out by
just isolating insulin

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.100
from cow pancreases
and dog pancreases.

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.490
And then, as you can imagine,
this is quite tedious.

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:51.160
Some people would have an
immune response against a cow

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.050
form of insulin versus human.

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:55.030
And so the first
version of insulin

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:57.670
was synthesized in the 1960s.

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.310
Then with the advent of
recombinant DNA technology,

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.740
this ability for not
just your own selves

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:06.730
to take genetic information
and make a protein out of it,

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.860
but also harness other cells--

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.110
whether they're human
or bacterial cells.

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:13.360
We can take those
genes, and then

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.894
have that new cell make
a protein of interest.

00:04:16.894 --> 00:04:19.060
And now, there's not nearly
as much of a background.

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.740
Purification is
still a challenge.

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:24.490
But basing recombinant DNA
technology starting in the 70s

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.390
really transformed our ability
to get to biotherapeutics--

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:31.190
these larger biomolecules.

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.100
And this was really
a result of lots,

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.050
of lots of interesting
chemistry that was developed.

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.570
So why is it that it is so
easy to sequence a gene now?

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:42.580
There are a lot of chemists who
worked on ways of enzymatically

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.390
synthesizing genes, being
able to find ways to analyze

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:49.570
those genes, as well as
being able to synthesize

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:52.000
the little fragments
that are used in what's

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.860
called a polymerase
chain reaction to make

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.750
many copies of a gene.

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:57.980
So these are all
different chemical

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.220
and biochemical
techniques that had

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:03.490
to be developed in order
for structure function

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.180
relationships to be easy to do
with genes, genetic material,

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.040
nucleic acids.

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:13.511
While I was a post doc at
Stanford in the late 1990s,

00:05:13.511 --> 00:05:15.010
there's a lot of
technology that was

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:17.260
starting to be developed
on this end too.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.090
So Bruce Merrifield
won the Nobel Prize

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:22.180
in chemistry in the
1980s for coming up

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:24.190
with an automated way
of stringing together

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.740
amino acids to make peptides.

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:29.800
So that now, if you're
interested in a specific gene

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.650
or peptide, you don't
have to contact a chemist.

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:34.960
You can just go online,
put in the sequence,

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.470
and order your favorite
gene or protein.

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:40.630
There's a lot of different
methods for analysis

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:43.350
of proteins,
purification of proteins,

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:44.980
as well as enzymatic
methods that

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:47.560
now make it relatively
straightforward although still

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.690
challenging depending
on the sequence,

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:53.530
to access genetic material
and to access proteins

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:57.440
from synthetic methods so
that you can get very well

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.320
defined compounds.

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:00.700
So it's one compound.

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:04.480
Not a mixture the way you might
get from a natural source.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:10.420
Now, we discovered after
insulin it doesn't end there.

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:13.090
What is genetically encoded,
you make the protein.

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:14.770
But after that,
there's all sorts

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:17.740
of modifications that can
happen to that protein that

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:20.140
affect its ability
to for example,

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:22.120
transfer across membranes.

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:23.890
How long it will
circulate in your blood

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:26.590
will depend on these
other modifications.

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:28.720
And one of those very
important modifications

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:32.110
that happens to proteins is
the addition of lots of sugars.

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:34.930
Here's just a schematic
of a large sugar.

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:36.940
These sugars can be
large enough that they're

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:38.590
as large as the protein itself.

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:40.510
And historically,
biochemists would just

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:44.320
cleave the sugars off and study
the protein calling it good.

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.690
Because oftentimes,
the same protein

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:49.210
could have a slightly different
bunch of sugars on it.

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:53.400
So it made the problem
a lot more complicated.

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:56.070
Now, especially with all the
monoclonal antibody therapies,

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:58.390
we're discovering the
sugars actually matter.

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:01.620
They matter not just in the
pharmacokinetic properties.

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:04.170
In other words, how well
does this biotherapeutic

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:07.540
circulate in your
bloodstream for example?

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:09.365
How quickly does it get cleared?

00:07:09.365 --> 00:07:10.740
But it can also
make a difference

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:14.070
on the actual biology of
how that monoclonal antibody

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:15.120
interacts.

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:18.240
And so this has really led
to an increased understanding

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:21.090
that we need to figure out
how to study sugars too.

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:22.930
Not just ignore them.

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:26.440
And so now, you look
at this scheme here.

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:29.100
Why is it that the sugars
are so difficult to study?

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:31.050
And I'll give you a
few slides specifically

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:32.582
as to why these
are so challenging.

00:07:32.582 --> 00:07:35.040
But basically, when I set up
my independent research career

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:36.990
in 2000, I thought
well, it would

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:40.200
be nice to be able to get
these sorts of tools--

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:42.240
to be able to have
commercial chemical

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:44.910
synthesis of a carbohydrate
that doesn't take years

00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:46.650
and costs tens of
thousands of dollars

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:48.750
for a simple
trisaccharide stringing

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:50.490
three sugars together.

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:52.180
We need better
analytical methods.

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:55.890
We also ideally, could perhaps
harness biology to help us make

00:07:55.890 --> 00:07:57.600
some of these compounds.

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:00.000
And fortunately, for the field
the United States National

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.880
Academy of Sciences put
out a report in 2012

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:04.830
that identified
these exact areas

00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:08.040
as increasingly important
areas that we need

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:09.600
to really fund and develop.

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:11.190
The inherent chemistry.

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:13.800
Essentially, it said,
chemists we need you.

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:16.140
We need to figure out
the tools and techniques

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:18.390
to study this class
of biomolecules

00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:21.210
that mimics the way
we've studied peptides

00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:24.110
and nucleic acids.

00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:26.939
So why is it that the
study of carbohydrates

00:08:26.939 --> 00:08:28.855
has lagged so far behind
the study of peptides

00:08:28.855 --> 00:08:30.770
and nucleic acids?

00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:33.620
Well, here is your first
chemical structure.

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:37.990
So here is a very, very
basic carbohydrate.

00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:41.740
So it's basically a backbone
of carbon with water on it.

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:43.400
That is carbohydrate.

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:46.120
Now, if I just draw
it this way, glucose

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:47.800
is the most common carbohydrate.

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:50.560
And that is what's powering
your brain right now so you

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:51.820
can pay attention.

00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:54.520
But I can't tell what
this actually is just

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:56.050
from looking at its structure.

00:08:56.050 --> 00:08:58.960
Because it turns out, in
three dimensional space,

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:00.970
there's many possibilities.

00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:05.230
And in fact, this is
the many possibilities

00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:08.830
that a structure drawn flat
like this actually could be.

00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:11.789
Now, not only for many of
you, but for many chemists,

00:09:11.789 --> 00:09:13.330
they run screaming
when they see this

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:14.730
because it's just confusing.

00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:16.990
This is like looking out at
the Harvard Marching Band,

00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:19.448
and seeing a whole bunch of
crimson blazers and black pants

00:09:19.448 --> 00:09:21.580
and going, where is my friend?

00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:27.070
So I have color coded some
of these sugars for you.

00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:30.400
So basically, the difference
between each of these sugars

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:33.390
is just how this hydroxyl group
as it's called, this alcohol,

00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:39.190
is oriented in space around this
three dimensional structure.

00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:40.619
And so to me, this
is fascinating

00:09:40.619 --> 00:09:42.910
because you really need to
have an understanding of how

00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:45.680
this looks in three
dimensions, not just two.

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:48.700
But it makes it a killer problem
from an analytical standpoint

00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:50.800
and a synthetic
standpoint if you

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:52.930
look at all these
different possibilities.

00:09:52.930 --> 00:09:55.390
And so if you look
at the possibilities

00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:57.640
for making different
kinds of sugar chains,

00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:00.460
even something very simple
like just hooking two things

00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:03.070
together, there are four
different nucleotides

00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:05.290
for deoxynucleic acid.

00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:06.940
You get four different
possibilities.

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:10.450
You can get 16 possibilities
when you make a dimer.

00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:12.640
There are about 20 amino
acids for proteins.

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:14.920
That leaves you with 400 diners.

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:17.830
If you only take
these 16 sugars,

00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:21.880
you can find 2,560
different possibilities

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:24.520
of connecting those two sugars.

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:26.860
And believe me, there's
many, many other

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:28.210
naturally occurring sugars.

00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:29.560
There's literally hundreds.

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:33.070
So you can start seeing this
becomes an incredible problem

00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:36.250
in terms of if somebody hands
me a sample from a bacteria

00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:38.770
that I've never seen,
what is the sugar?

00:10:38.770 --> 00:10:41.710
It is extremely challenging to
tell you what that sugar is.

00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:43.990
And so then, of course, it
makes it very challenging

00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:46.510
to develop a vaccine
based on that sugar

00:10:46.510 --> 00:10:50.190
if you can't even
tell what it is.

00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:53.210
And so this is part of the
fun part of this project.

00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:55.060
But it's also part of
the frustrating part

00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:57.010
of looking at sugars.

00:10:57.010 --> 00:10:59.950
So this is part
of a basic problem

00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:02.830
that chemists are
facing right now.

00:11:02.830 --> 00:11:06.970
If you look back to the 1800s,
chemists were empirically

00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:09.016
looking at a lot of
different reactions,

00:11:09.016 --> 00:11:10.390
and trying to
figure out what are

00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:12.500
all these different elements.

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:15.492
And this is my redrawing of
Mendeleev's Periodic Table.

00:11:15.492 --> 00:11:16.450
This is how he drew it.

00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:18.590
But I basically just
turned it on its side.

00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:22.460
So it looks a little bit more
like the modern periodic table.

00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:24.790
But he basically took
empirical information

00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:27.580
from different reactions
with different elements,

00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:29.130
and then started
seeing patterns.

00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:31.450
And the beauty of
this periodic table

00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:34.040
is the fact that it gives
you predictive power.

00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:35.650
So these question
marks were elements

00:11:35.650 --> 00:11:38.020
that he predicted
or later discovered.

00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:40.630
And I can look at this
and say, ah, sulfur,

00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:43.890
which is one way that you can
link a sugar to a protein,

00:11:43.890 --> 00:11:45.640
should have similar
but slightly different

00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:48.250
properties than the
oxygen linkages that link

00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:50.870
some other sugars to proteins.

00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:53.390
So if you're looking at
two different elements,

00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:55.360
the periodic table
is a fantastic way

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:58.010
of generating hypotheses.

00:11:58.010 --> 00:11:59.980
Now, one thing I should
make you aware of

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:02.632
is the fact that the vast
majority of these elements

00:12:02.632 --> 00:12:04.340
we really don't know
that much about yet.

00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:09.520
And the reactivity and how they
can react with other compounds

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:11.440
is largely still
unknown surprisingly,

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:15.520
even though we've had this basic
heuristic for studying these.

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:19.570
Now, my focus has been primarily
on the carbon and the oxygen

00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:20.474
up here.

00:12:20.474 --> 00:12:22.390
And this is in the study
of organic chemistry.

00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:24.250
It's all the different
cool structures

00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:27.490
that carbon can make
especially in natural settings

00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:29.540
like in human biology.

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:34.960
And so the next sort of leap
was this idea of how does

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:37.150
a group of these atoms react?

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:39.970
And so many of you are familiar
with these two compounds

00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:41.980
in their aqueous dilute form--

00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:44.350
ethanol, or vodka
in it's aqueous

00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:47.320
dilute form, or acetic
acid, or vinegar.

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:50.470
And ask anyone who's tried
vinegar versus vodka,

00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:52.180
they're quite different.

00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:54.850
And you see it from a
chemical standpoint here,

00:12:54.850 --> 00:12:56.410
this is an alcohol.

00:12:56.410 --> 00:12:58.660
And this is an acid.

00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:01.570
These are what we call two
different functional groups.

00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:04.930
And interestingly, the entire
undergrad organic chemistry

00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:06.730
classes that I and many
people have taught,

00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:08.900
are based on this idea
of functional groups.

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:13.240
It allows me to compare and have
some predictive power about how

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:17.020
an alcohol might react and
interact with other compounds

00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:19.420
versus how an acid might react.

00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:23.590
What I found amusing was
this quote from Saul Patai

00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:25.360
and this whole first
volume in the series

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:27.570
on functional groups in 1964.

00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:29.200
It made me argue
that the treatment

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:31.870
of a single functional group is
not in accordance with the most

00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:33.220
modern principles.

00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:35.350
Still, organic
chemistry and in most

00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:37.630
places taught according
to functional groups.

00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:40.180
And the mnemotechnic
advantages of this division

00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:41.770
are so great that
it will probably not

00:13:41.770 --> 00:13:44.137
be displaced for
many decades to come.

00:13:44.137 --> 00:13:45.970
And in fact, it still
hasn't been displaced.

00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:48.310
It's exactly how I
still teach this.

00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:52.270
Now, you may recall from
my structures of sugars,

00:13:52.270 --> 00:13:55.930
that it's all alcohols.

00:13:55.930 --> 00:13:58.090
Now, what do I do?

00:13:58.090 --> 00:14:01.600
So here, I have
those same 16 sugars.

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:04.080
And now, all I've done is
remove one of these hydroxyls

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:07.450
to give you the entire
16 deoxy series.

00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:08.890
I could add acids.

00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:11.740
I can make literally
dozens and dozens

00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:13.310
of different carbohydrates.

00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:16.120
So the problem now is there
is no heuristic model.

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:18.220
And now, that all of
these functional groups

00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:21.700
are identical, they're just
altering their placement

00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:23.090
in space.

00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:26.310
We don't have great
ways of predicting

00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:28.990
how one compound will react
versus another compound

00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:29.650
will react.

00:14:29.650 --> 00:14:31.525
And this is one of the
frontiers in chemistry

00:14:31.525 --> 00:14:33.610
now is, how do you deal
with a molecule that

00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:35.770
has all these identical
functional groups

00:14:35.770 --> 00:14:37.060
in the same molecule?

00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:39.700
How do I predict how
this molecule will react?

00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:41.650
And where for example?

00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:43.876
Now, when I look at
something like this, and go,

00:14:43.876 --> 00:14:45.250
OK, the differences
are not going

00:14:45.250 --> 00:14:48.220
to be nearly as great as the
difference between ethanol

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:49.930
and vinegar for example.

00:14:49.930 --> 00:14:53.350
How am I going to deal with
these more subtle differences?

00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:55.480
And so one thing that
my group has approached

00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:58.990
taking this problem is looking
at this entire set as opposed

00:14:58.990 --> 00:15:02.380
to just focusing on
something like just glucose

00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:04.480
or just galactose, which
are found in humans.

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:07.360
So three of these sugars
have been studied a lot.

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:08.110
The rest have not.

00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:10.700
In part, because they're
difficult to access.

00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:12.670
So we're looking at
the entire isomer set.

00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:14.170
And we also realize
that we're going

00:15:14.170 --> 00:15:15.790
to have to do some
very carefully

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:18.220
controlled experiments
to be able to tease out

00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:20.140
subtle differences.

00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:23.470
Now, one of the other fun things
about being an organic chemist

00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:25.510
is actually doing chemistry.

00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:29.030
It's really pretty much the
whole mind body experience.

00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:32.465
I get to use my senses of sense.

00:15:32.465 --> 00:15:34.960
A lot of chemists
used to taste, but we

00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:37.540
tend not to do that anymore.

00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:38.060
Sights.

00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:39.190
Sounds.

00:15:39.190 --> 00:15:41.710
When you're running
an experiment,

00:15:41.710 --> 00:15:45.460
you're fully all in using your
brain as well as your body.

00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:48.880
The problem then is there can
be a large lead time in learning

00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:51.400
the techniques of chemistry.

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:54.280
And so, it's also
I realize we're

00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:56.530
going to have to start
thinking about how to take some

00:15:56.530 --> 00:15:59.920
of the human factor out of this
in order to run experiments

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:02.680
reproducibly to be
able to get access

00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:05.170
to some of the underlying
phenomena of nature

00:16:05.170 --> 00:16:07.460
of comparing these compounds.

00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:09.490
So today, I'm going
to tell you primarily

00:16:09.490 --> 00:16:11.430
about our chemical synthesis.

00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:14.530
But my group really approaches
these problems as interrelated.

00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:16.810
And that also distinguishes
my group from many others.

00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:20.110
I realized on the
analytical end for example,

00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:23.126
we don't have authentic
standards of compounds

00:16:23.126 --> 00:16:25.000
to develop analytical
methods because they're

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.710
so difficult to make.

00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:28.690
The scale at which I
need to make compounds

00:16:28.690 --> 00:16:31.090
is in large part dictated
by the analytical methods

00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:33.790
because they require a fair
amount of the compound.

00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:36.970
And so I realized these were
all interrelated problems.

00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:40.600
And so my group is trying
to study these basically

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:42.160
as a whole system.

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:44.860
And trying to not just
optimize one reaction.

00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:47.500
But it pushed the
entire system forward.

00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:50.134
And I'd be happy in question
and answer or later to talk more

00:16:50.134 --> 00:16:50.800
about this work.

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:52.750
But today, I'm to
tell you a little bit

00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:56.410
about how we're approaching
the chemical synthesis problem.

00:16:56.410 --> 00:16:58.480
How do we start
looking at something

00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:00.900
that's so complicated?

00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:02.564
So I mentioned the
fact that we really

00:17:02.564 --> 00:17:04.980
wanted to be able to take a
little bit of the human factor

00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:07.859
out of making these molecules,
and why is it so difficult?

00:17:07.859 --> 00:17:09.839
You saw the basic structure.

00:17:09.839 --> 00:17:14.153
Stringing these things together
can be quite lengthy syntheses.

00:17:14.153 --> 00:17:16.319
And the reproducibility is
not because we're somehow

00:17:16.319 --> 00:17:19.950
uniquely unable to reproduce so
much as if you have a 20 step

00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:22.980
process or a 40 step
process, it's unlikely

00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:24.750
that many people are
going to be motivated

00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:26.950
and rich enough to
reproduce the process.

00:17:26.950 --> 00:17:28.510
And so that's a big problem.

00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:30.750
And this is a problem with
nucleic acids and peptides

00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:33.090
too until commercial
automated synthesis

00:17:33.090 --> 00:17:35.340
platforms became available.

00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:37.650
Now, the ways that
these became available

00:17:37.650 --> 00:17:40.160
was attaching everything
onto a solid phase.

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:42.630
Literally, you can attach
your first building block

00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:46.110
onto a solid phase, grow
your biopolymer chain,

00:17:46.110 --> 00:17:49.565
rinse away all your reactions,
reagents that you don't need,

00:17:49.565 --> 00:17:50.940
and then you can
grow your chain.

00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:53.070
In fact, that's exactly
what we tried initially.

00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:55.111
But there are various
problems with that approach

00:17:55.111 --> 00:17:57.092
when you look at sugars.

00:17:57.092 --> 00:17:58.800
There's still a lot
of difficult linkages

00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:00.450
that I won't go into details.

00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:02.650
You still need stuff
to put on your machine.

00:18:02.650 --> 00:18:05.520
The actual building blocks
that you put on the machine.

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:07.290
Analyzing the products
can be challenging.

00:18:07.290 --> 00:18:09.040
Purifying the products
can be challenging.

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:13.110
And still is for peptides from
automated peptide synthesis.

00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:15.990
And then ideally, we'd also
be able to interface anything

00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:20.262
that we use to be able to
make carbohydrates reliably.

00:18:20.262 --> 00:18:21.720
We should be able
to also interface

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:24.480
that with the already
available methods

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:26.520
to make peptides
in order to look

00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:30.330
at that bio therapeutic space
in a very systematic way

00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:32.760
to do systematic structure
functional relationships

00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:35.130
as we're calling it.

00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:38.250
So I had the opportunity 3 1/2
weeks ago to go to the German

00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:40.170
apothecary museum in Heidelberg.

00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:42.250
And frankly, I
felt right at home.

00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:46.169
In fact, going to the museum
I passed by Bunsen's house.

00:18:46.169 --> 00:18:48.210
And many of you might be
familiar with the Bunsen

00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:48.870
burner.

00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:49.854
And I was so excited.

00:18:49.854 --> 00:18:52.020
I told my husband you've
got to get a picture of me.

00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:54.430
And the people walking by
probably thought I was crazy.

00:18:54.430 --> 00:18:55.750
But I didn't care.

00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:59.050
Look, how many times have
I used the Bunsen burner?

00:18:59.050 --> 00:19:01.210
It's great because now I
don't have to use bellows.

00:19:01.210 --> 00:19:02.793
That was the only
thing in that museum

00:19:02.793 --> 00:19:05.760
that I realized electricity
was a great thing

00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:07.350
to be able to control heat.

00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:09.510
But otherwise, we still
have mortar and pestles,

00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:11.640
we still have sand baths,
we've got all sorts

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:14.640
of really cool glassware.

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:16.200
The only problem
with this approach

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:19.710
is that many times frankly,
in my graduate career,

00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:22.197
I would reproduce the
prep from the 1800s.

00:19:22.197 --> 00:19:23.280
And it worked beautifully.

00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:24.460
Crystals would crash out.

00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:26.640
You're like, you felt
this visceral connection

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:29.160
to this chemist
who's been long dead.

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:31.410
The problem is there
was a long lag time

00:19:31.410 --> 00:19:33.120
in learning all the techniques.

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:34.939
When you read a
procedure, they just

00:19:34.939 --> 00:19:37.230
assume that you know how to
put the glassware together,

00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:39.016
and how you might
heat or do anything.

00:19:39.016 --> 00:19:40.890
And so there's quite a
bit of training period

00:19:40.890 --> 00:19:43.660
in learning how to do this.

00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:45.270
So I realized that
we're going to have

00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:48.450
to start-- if we're looking at
these very subtle differences

00:19:48.450 --> 00:19:51.400
in reactivity that we're
looking at with carbohydrates,

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:56.040
this sort of manual approach
is introducing enough errors

00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:58.750
that they might
obscure or obliterate

00:19:58.750 --> 00:20:01.420
the subtle differences
that we're looking for.

00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:06.450
And so, basically, that was
one of the major driving

00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:08.216
motivations in
automating senses.

00:20:08.216 --> 00:20:09.840
Of course, it can be
important in terms

00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:12.240
of trying to develop
the biotherapeutics,

00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:13.980
but I also see it
as central to being

00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:17.910
able to understand the
underlying fundamental

00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:21.102
chemistry and how
these molecules react.

00:20:21.102 --> 00:20:22.560
So why do we want
to automate this?

00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:26.100
Some of you may recognize
these sugar building blocks.

00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:27.570
We have individual
building blocks

00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:29.640
that we'd like to
put into a machine,

00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:31.212
and then just string
them together.

00:20:31.212 --> 00:20:32.670
Three to nine of
these sugars would

00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:34.350
be enough to be
able to start doing

00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:36.300
a lot of fundamental
biology work, as well

00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:38.027
as the biotherapeutics
[INAUDIBLE]..

00:20:38.027 --> 00:20:40.360
And of course, the reason we
want to automate it in part

00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:42.749
is to eliminate a
lot of tedious labor.

00:20:42.749 --> 00:20:44.790
There are only a handful
of carbohydrate chemists

00:20:44.790 --> 00:20:46.030
on the planet.

00:20:46.030 --> 00:20:48.150
Not nearly enough
to feed the need

00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:51.570
for being able to make
these kinds of structures.

00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:53.700
So ideally, we'd be
able to easily generate

00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:57.630
diverse sugars in very
well-controlled sequences

00:20:57.630 --> 00:21:02.796
so that we can look at the
function based on the sequence.

00:21:02.796 --> 00:21:04.170
And the thing that
I didn't fully

00:21:04.170 --> 00:21:06.420
appreciate until we
started doing automation

00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:08.490
15 years ago in my
lab is that it also

00:21:08.490 --> 00:21:11.790
forces you to develop readily
reproducible chemistry.

00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:15.150
So where a needle
goes into a solution

00:21:15.150 --> 00:21:17.260
can make a difference
in the reactivity,

00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:19.260
and the outcome of the reaction.

00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:20.790
And so all of these
things turn out

00:21:20.790 --> 00:21:24.690
to matter when it comes to
actually running your reaction.

00:21:24.690 --> 00:21:27.450
And that's what we need
to discern the underlying

00:21:27.450 --> 00:21:31.980
logic of these relatively subtle
differences between compounds.

00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:33.790
So how do we go
about doing that?

00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:35.520
So here's Kevon, who
is a senior graduate

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:39.030
student in the lab with one
of our three synthesizers.

00:21:39.030 --> 00:21:41.400
Our goal, like I said. is
just to string three to nine

00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:43.750
of these sugars
together reliably.

00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:46.800
And this, I have to say just
the actual robotics of this

00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:49.470
is quite a bit more complicated
than a solid phase peptide

00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:52.290
synthesizer because now,
I'm not just rinsing resins.

00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:55.610
But I'm asking everything
to be done in solution.

00:21:55.610 --> 00:21:57.240
Not enough solid
phase where you need

00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:59.860
lots of excess reagents
and building blocks

00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:00.910
but in solution.

00:22:00.910 --> 00:22:03.600
And that's really what's
unique about our platform.

00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:07.840
And ideally, the reactions must
be amenable to liquid handling

00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:11.100
because this entire thing
we have to make a solution,

00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:14.390
have a robot deliver
that to the glass flask,

00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:15.840
and I'll show you here.

00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:19.885
Basically, we have our component
with a little basically tag.

00:22:19.885 --> 00:22:21.510
It's like a little
affinity tag that we

00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:23.070
attach under our sugar--

00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:24.880
maintains a solution.

00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:27.030
And then, we can couple
each of our building blocks

00:22:27.030 --> 00:22:29.164
and grow the chain like that.

00:22:29.164 --> 00:22:30.580
So basically, to
get this to work,

00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:32.610
we need to develop a
purification system

00:22:32.610 --> 00:22:36.420
to be able to get this
fish out from the mess

00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:38.367
of other compounds
that are in there.

00:22:38.367 --> 00:22:40.200
We need sufficient
amounts of these building

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:42.990
blocks, which is something we're
still very actively working on.

00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:46.230
And then, we of course need
methods to put the building

00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:49.770
blocks together in a way that
a stupid machine or a robot

00:22:49.770 --> 00:22:51.270
can deliver them.

00:22:51.270 --> 00:22:53.117
And so I don't expect
you to look at all--

00:22:53.117 --> 00:22:55.200
here are some of the details
if you're interested.

00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:57.210
But basically, this
machine has a whole bunch

00:22:57.210 --> 00:22:59.340
of glass reactor blocks.

00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:02.820
A little bit step up from
the old apothecary lab.

00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:04.110
Certainly costs more.

00:23:04.110 --> 00:23:07.230
And then we have a robotic
arm that delivers the reagents

00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:08.890
as we need them.

00:23:08.890 --> 00:23:11.400
And it's all
basically controlled

00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:13.530
from the central computer.

00:23:13.530 --> 00:23:15.510
And then it does all
the purification steps

00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:17.520
to be able to do this
sort of iterative process,

00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:20.120
and string together
sugars one by one.

00:23:22.670 --> 00:23:24.490
Now, the development
of the process

00:23:24.490 --> 00:23:27.550
has allowed us to make
oligosaccharide synthesis

00:23:27.550 --> 00:23:29.500
a much more reproducible
process than it

00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:32.740
was before when we had to
rely on each individual person

00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:33.932
doing these things.

00:23:33.932 --> 00:23:35.890
We use the computer to
tell the various machine

00:23:35.890 --> 00:23:37.090
parts what to do.

00:23:37.090 --> 00:23:41.020
And all the variables, including
the timing, are specified.

00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:43.490
So how long does
it take from where

00:23:43.490 --> 00:23:45.850
one reagent goes into that
flask versus another one?

00:23:45.850 --> 00:23:48.700
That is programmed now as
opposed to a person going

00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:51.940
in there and manually adding
and not necessarily writing

00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:53.082
down how long it took.

00:23:53.082 --> 00:23:55.540
And you see a huge difference
between a first year graduate

00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:57.331
student and a fifth
year graduate student--

00:23:57.331 --> 00:23:59.899
how long it takes to get the
second reagent in the flask.

00:23:59.899 --> 00:24:01.690
And the other great
thing is these programs

00:24:01.690 --> 00:24:04.180
can be easily shared
between researchers

00:24:04.180 --> 00:24:09.559
in a much more exact way than
a written protocol can be.

00:24:09.559 --> 00:24:11.850
Though the other thing that's
nice about the automation

00:24:11.850 --> 00:24:13.620
platform, and I won't
go into details,

00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:15.310
it's forced us to
develop new chemistry.

00:24:15.310 --> 00:24:18.400
And that's always exciting from
a development point of view--

00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:21.910
is that OK, what is now that
we have this process what are

00:24:21.910 --> 00:24:24.260
the next set of limitations?

00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:25.960
And that's led us
into developing

00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:28.630
some chemistry of something
an element that Mendeleev

00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:31.960
didn't get the molecular weight
correct but did do existed.

00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:35.350
Bismuth, which is once
again, on of those elements

00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:37.150
that there's
surprisingly little known

00:24:37.150 --> 00:24:39.760
about in terms of its
reactivity and chemistry.

00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:42.280
It's also allowed us to adapt.

00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:46.600
Look at how do you adapt a
manual process into something

00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:48.324
that you can do on a machine.

00:24:48.324 --> 00:24:49.990
And sometimes the
chemistry doesn't just

00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:51.380
translate automatically.

00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:53.470
You have to develop new
kinds of chemistries.

00:24:53.470 --> 00:24:56.080
And so that's also been
a large part of my lab

00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:58.150
is thinking about how do
we go about developing

00:24:58.150 --> 00:25:00.610
new chemistries, and what
kind of new chemistries

00:25:00.610 --> 00:25:04.030
can we discover now that
we have this essentially

00:25:04.030 --> 00:25:09.290
creative limitation in having
to use an automation platform.

00:25:09.290 --> 00:25:12.130
Now, so far, very few
reactions have been shown

00:25:12.130 --> 00:25:13.910
to work on automated chemistry.

00:25:13.910 --> 00:25:16.270
So the vast majority of
different kinds of chemistry

00:25:16.270 --> 00:25:19.030
that are run in the world are
still done the old fashioned

00:25:19.030 --> 00:25:21.387
way-- manually.

00:25:21.387 --> 00:25:23.470
In this particular case,
we use a computer program

00:25:23.470 --> 00:25:25.570
to tell the various
machine parts what to do,

00:25:25.570 --> 00:25:27.690
which is not a very common
skill among chemists.

00:25:27.690 --> 00:25:31.750
Very few chemists have
computer programming skills

00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:33.472
or background.

00:25:33.472 --> 00:25:35.680
The interesting thing though
is if you took that code

00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:37.630
off this computer,
you'd have no idea

00:25:37.630 --> 00:25:39.010
what it was actually running.

00:25:39.010 --> 00:25:41.200
Nowhere in the code
does it tell you

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:44.800
what this entire
complex actually is.

00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:47.170
And the other criticism
is this machine

00:25:47.170 --> 00:25:49.360
is only accessible to
those of us who have

00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:51.430
extremely well-funded labs.

00:25:51.430 --> 00:25:54.610
And so then, how do you also
make this more accessible?

00:25:54.610 --> 00:25:56.602
If you want to take all
the manual processes,

00:25:56.602 --> 00:25:58.060
the hundreds of
different chemistry

00:25:58.060 --> 00:26:00.435
processes that are being
run around the world,

00:26:00.435 --> 00:26:01.810
and make them into
something that

00:26:01.810 --> 00:26:03.910
could be machine readable
so we can ultimately

00:26:03.910 --> 00:26:07.180
mine that data to look for
these more subtle effects that

00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:10.000
are not as obvious as a
difference between one

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.940
functional group or another
or one element or another.

00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:15.191
But more subtle differences
like, why is this hydrogen

00:26:15.191 --> 00:26:16.190
different than that one?

00:26:16.190 --> 00:26:18.250
Or why is this hydroxyl
different than the other?

00:26:18.250 --> 00:26:22.450
Ideally, we'd have a method that
all reactions will be produced

00:26:22.450 --> 00:26:25.210
in a way that's
reproducible, and produces

00:26:25.210 --> 00:26:27.550
data that's machine readable
that we can ultimately

00:26:27.550 --> 00:26:28.850
mine that data.

00:26:28.850 --> 00:26:30.970
So that's the bigger
picture long term goal

00:26:30.970 --> 00:26:33.040
in the idea of automating.

00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:35.150
So part of what I also
did in coming to Radcliffe

00:26:35.150 --> 00:26:38.440
is thinking about OK, we
have this fancy machine.

00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:40.000
It's interesting
training students

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.950
to use the machine
because I mean

00:26:41.950 --> 00:26:44.170
I was trained as a
traditional chemist

00:26:44.170 --> 00:26:45.700
too in that you
have to give up some

00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:48.880
of that visceral fun of
running your reactions

00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:50.500
when you have the machine do it.

00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:53.590
And as soon you make a
mistake in programming it,

00:26:53.590 --> 00:26:55.630
and the needle doesn't
go where you say it does,

00:26:55.630 --> 00:26:57.460
I just want to go
back to the bench

00:26:57.460 --> 00:26:58.990
and run it the
old fashioned way.

00:26:58.990 --> 00:27:01.960
So there's definitely
issues of just adapting

00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:05.012
to having a machine run
your reactions for you.

00:27:05.012 --> 00:27:06.720
And so in thinking
about this, part of it

00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:10.000
is this is a huge
leap from those glass

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.100
retorts in the Heidelberg
Apothecary Museum.

00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:14.960
It's very, very different.

00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:17.830
And so when I think about how
most chemists set up reactions,

00:27:17.830 --> 00:27:20.110
we have a round
bottom glass flask,

00:27:20.110 --> 00:27:23.145
we have some way to heat
our reaction for example,

00:27:23.145 --> 00:27:24.520
and some way to
add our reagents.

00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:26.050
There are all different parts.

00:27:26.050 --> 00:27:27.130
And we put this together.

00:27:27.130 --> 00:27:28.963
And I remember being
trained as a first year

00:27:28.963 --> 00:27:31.030
by a senior graduate
student in another group,

00:27:31.030 --> 00:27:34.600
you look in there and this
set up was a beauty to behold.

00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:36.960
It was an aesthetically
pleasing experience just

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:40.270
to look at this reaction set up.

00:27:40.270 --> 00:27:43.490
And learning how to do
that, and do it reproducibly

00:27:43.490 --> 00:27:45.620
takes a little bit of time.

00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:49.000
So one of the things I'm doing
with Benjamin Lee, who's here

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.610
with one of my Radcliffe's
research partners,

00:27:51.610 --> 00:27:53.740
and Alex [? Majelous ?]
who's a senior graduate

00:27:53.740 --> 00:27:57.010
student in the Pentelute Lab
at MIT where I'm also working,

00:27:57.010 --> 00:27:59.260
is think about how
do we make setting up

00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:03.040
an automated chemical process
as easy as setting up LEGOs.

00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:06.220
I played with a lot of LEGOs
and building blocks as a kid.

00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:09.670
And the beauty is you have a
limited set of building blocks,

00:28:09.670 --> 00:28:11.524
and you can build
just about anything.

00:28:11.524 --> 00:28:13.190
And we'd like to be
able to do that too.

00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:16.510
But in a way that you can
reproduce it by making it

00:28:16.510 --> 00:28:18.370
machine readable and codeable.

00:28:18.370 --> 00:28:20.950
So how do we make setting up
reactions using automation

00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:23.770
as easy as building the
usual glassware setups?

00:28:23.770 --> 00:28:25.610
How do we code the setup itself?

00:28:25.610 --> 00:28:28.435
Not just the program that
tells the setup what to do.

00:28:28.435 --> 00:28:30.310
But you should be able
to look at the program

00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:32.530
and say, ah, this is
what I need to go set up

00:28:32.530 --> 00:28:34.890
this particular setup.

00:28:34.890 --> 00:28:37.390
And then, we also have to think
about what should the output

00:28:37.390 --> 00:28:40.300
files be in order to actually
make the whole process machine

00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:42.580
readable so that
all the data ideally

00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:47.800
from every lab across the planet
can be produced in such a way

00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:51.080
that you can start looking
at this data using machine

00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:52.810
algorithms.

00:28:52.810 --> 00:28:55.510
And so this is something
that Benjamin, and Alex,

00:28:55.510 --> 00:28:58.180
and I have been working
on in the last semester.

00:28:58.180 --> 00:28:59.720
And it's been a lot of fun.

00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:02.380
So basically, we have
components in the lab

00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:06.739
like this valve that can switch
from one thing to another.

00:29:06.739 --> 00:29:09.280
And you look at the back of it
it's got a little serial port.

00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:11.617
And basically, now,
the little components--

00:29:11.617 --> 00:29:13.450
you'll see you'll notice
a difference here--

00:29:13.450 --> 00:29:17.180
is basically another computer
chip that has a Wi-Fi signal.

00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:20.080
So this is basically a
relatively straightforward

00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:23.230
simple method where we can
take some of the components

00:29:23.230 --> 00:29:25.510
that we have in
the lab and Wi-Fi

00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:27.010
enable them to
put them onto what

00:29:27.010 --> 00:29:28.870
we call the internet of things.

00:29:28.870 --> 00:29:31.121
How many of you have heard
of the internet of things?

00:29:31.121 --> 00:29:31.620
OK.

00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:32.600
So yeah.

00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:35.320
So we don't have a lot of
internet of things things

00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:37.030
yet in the chemistry labs.

00:29:37.030 --> 00:29:39.470
And so how do we go
about doing that?

00:29:39.470 --> 00:29:42.190
So the nice thing about having
this as opposed to cabling

00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:43.900
is now, you can
literally mix and match

00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:47.470
all these pieces in your
fume hood or on your bench.

00:29:47.470 --> 00:29:49.570
And then, have them
all talk to one other

00:29:49.570 --> 00:29:51.412
with a computer program.

00:29:51.412 --> 00:29:53.620
And so what Benjamin, Alex,
and I've been working on,

00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:56.290
is actually the program.

00:29:56.290 --> 00:29:59.470
How do we think about this
in a very modular approach

00:29:59.470 --> 00:30:03.250
so that the program spits
out what were the parts?

00:30:03.250 --> 00:30:05.987
What did we actually
put together?

00:30:05.987 --> 00:30:07.570
Because we're going
to have to connect

00:30:07.570 --> 00:30:10.400
all these different parts
usually with tubing.

00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:13.130
And then, how do we
get also a program

00:30:13.130 --> 00:30:15.840
that actually runs the process?

00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:17.660
So the idea is at the
end of this project,

00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:20.660
hopefully by May
or earlier, we'll

00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:23.327
have computer program code
that if we gave you the code,

00:30:23.327 --> 00:30:25.910
you could not only have a list
of all the components you would

00:30:25.910 --> 00:30:30.080
need that you could then
physically assemble and put

00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:31.190
together--

00:30:31.190 --> 00:30:33.920
I promise not to do
it in Byerly Hall--

00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:36.140
in your fume hood,
and then basically

00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:39.680
also have the program to run
those components so that you

00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:42.650
could run the reaction
in Bangladesh, and Ghana,

00:30:42.650 --> 00:30:45.650
in China, and India,
in Canada, anywhere

00:30:45.650 --> 00:30:47.540
around the world
exactly the same way

00:30:47.540 --> 00:30:50.490
that we ran it here in
Cambridge, Massachusetts.

00:30:50.490 --> 00:30:54.020
And so to that end
basically, we have

00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:55.730
the components, the
program that codes

00:30:55.730 --> 00:30:59.180
not just the protocol which
has been done with automation,

00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:00.590
but also the modules set up.

00:31:00.590 --> 00:31:04.610
So Benjamin programmed this so
that he hears the components

00:31:04.610 --> 00:31:07.160
that we need for this
particular reaction

00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:09.000
in a continuous process.

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.870
Here's the manifold, the pumps,
prints out the components.

00:31:11.870 --> 00:31:16.010
Tells you exactly the
type of tubing to hook up

00:31:16.010 --> 00:31:17.540
all these different components.

00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:19.880
And it also spits out
a nice little diagram

00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:23.957
so you get a sense of OK, if my
set up doesn't look like this,

00:31:23.957 --> 00:31:25.040
I've done something wrong.

00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:28.380
I'm missing a component
here somewhere or the other.

00:31:28.380 --> 00:31:32.540
And so now, we're going about
also developing ultimately will

00:31:32.540 --> 00:31:33.830
be a graphical user interface.

00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:37.220
But we notice graphical user
interfaces date themselves

00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:39.660
quite quickly compared to
the underlying programming.

00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:41.160
So that's why we're
waiting for that

00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:45.220
to be last so that it can
also be easily updated.

00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:49.190
And so now, we have the
first sort of modular way

00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:51.860
to be able to put
components together.

00:31:51.860 --> 00:31:54.890
And we're also hoping that all
this data will be in a machine

00:31:54.890 --> 00:31:57.530
readable format so
that we can deposit it,

00:31:57.530 --> 00:31:59.510
and anyone across the
planet could actually

00:31:59.510 --> 00:32:03.800
start mining that
data from the outputs.

00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:06.730
So part of what we've been
using this setup for initially,

00:32:06.730 --> 00:32:10.180
is to be able to link a
sugar to an amino acid.

00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:13.030
The very basic
component of a peptide.

00:32:13.030 --> 00:32:14.830
So this goes back to
the title of the talk,

00:32:14.830 --> 00:32:18.640
how do I marry the automated
oligosaccharides synthesis

00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:20.980
to the automated
peptide synthesis?

00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:24.040
Well, the peptide
synthesizers use amino acids

00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:25.270
in a protected form.

00:32:25.270 --> 00:32:27.910
So the reactive group is
blocked with something

00:32:27.910 --> 00:32:29.440
to make it less reactive.

00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:32.260
And ideally, we'd like to be
able to put a sugar on there.

00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:33.850
Right now, you can
certainly do that.

00:32:33.850 --> 00:32:36.190
And they're extremely costly.

00:32:36.190 --> 00:32:39.100
In the case of this, an
amino acid with an oxygen

00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:40.700
linked here you
can buy that sugar,

00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:42.260
but it's about $10,000 a gram.

00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:44.620
And you start thinking, ah,
no wonder lots of people

00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:46.180
aren't working on this compound.

00:32:46.180 --> 00:32:48.790
Labs aren't that well-funded.

00:32:48.790 --> 00:32:53.560
And the starting with a process
my post-doc at IU developed,

00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:56.980
we have now, developed this
into a more automated process

00:32:56.980 --> 00:33:00.250
whereby we can flow in, make
a solution of our sugar,

00:33:00.250 --> 00:33:02.950
a solution of our
protected amino acid,

00:33:02.950 --> 00:33:07.280
and then in one step be able to
link these two things together

00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:08.800
so that after
purification, this is

00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:11.590
ready to go into a
solid phase peptide

00:33:11.590 --> 00:33:15.671
synthesizer in the Pentelute Lab
at MIT in this particular case.

00:33:15.671 --> 00:33:17.170
So it's the first
continuous process

00:33:17.170 --> 00:33:19.750
to make sure modified amino
acids is ready for solid phase

00:33:19.750 --> 00:33:21.070
peptide synthesis.

00:33:21.070 --> 00:33:23.890
And it's in the process
now of being automated.

00:33:23.890 --> 00:33:25.901
And it requires only
one step from these two

00:33:25.901 --> 00:33:27.400
commercial starting
materials, which

00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:29.050
also makes it more feasible.

00:33:29.050 --> 00:33:31.330
So we basically figured
we brought the price down

00:33:31.330 --> 00:33:34.180
for about $10,000 a gram
to about $10 a gram,

00:33:34.180 --> 00:33:37.090
so that we can start putting
these pieces together

00:33:37.090 --> 00:33:41.320
to be able to start synthesizing
glycosylated or sugar modified

00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:44.054
peptides, and looking
at that entire space.

00:33:44.054 --> 00:33:45.970
So one of the other
appeals of this fellowship

00:33:45.970 --> 00:33:48.640
is that there is a
large glycobiology

00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:51.340
center that moved to Harvard
Med School two years ago.

00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:53.500
And I'm also working with
Rick Cummings and his lab

00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:56.350
there to start looking
at generating antibodies

00:33:56.350 --> 00:33:59.050
for example specifically
against sulfur linked

00:33:59.050 --> 00:34:01.700
sugars versus the more commonly
oxygen and nitrogen linked

00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:02.200
sugars.

00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:04.810
Because frankly, we didn't
even know until two years ago

00:34:04.810 --> 00:34:09.639
that humans had sulfur linked
sugars naturally occurring

00:34:09.639 --> 00:34:10.980
in their proteins.

00:34:10.980 --> 00:34:13.120
So we're quite excited
about this possibility that

00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:15.940
opens up based on
the synthesis itself

00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:17.980
developing the synthesis.

00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:20.989
And so, how far along
are we to making

00:34:20.989 --> 00:34:22.420
precision biotherapeutics?

00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:24.590
Well, I hope to give
you a sense today

00:34:24.590 --> 00:34:27.860
that the chemistry
for stringing sugars

00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:30.889
together is becoming much more
well-developed than it was even

00:34:30.889 --> 00:34:33.030
in the last 10 years.

00:34:33.030 --> 00:34:35.820
We do have machines now that
can string together the sugars.

00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:37.639
But access to the
sugar building blocks

00:34:37.639 --> 00:34:39.914
themselves has turned
into the major hurdle.

00:34:39.914 --> 00:34:41.330
And so that's the
other reason why

00:34:41.330 --> 00:34:43.940
I'm excited about
lab scale automation

00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:47.330
of continuous processes to
be able to bring the steps

00:34:47.330 --> 00:34:49.179
to make the sugar
building blocks themselves

00:34:49.179 --> 00:34:50.929
into something feasible
so we could easily

00:34:50.929 --> 00:34:54.530
get kilos of material
to drive that chemistry.

00:34:54.530 --> 00:34:57.080
We have an easy modular
approach process

00:34:57.080 --> 00:34:58.820
to automate the
chemical synthesis

00:34:58.820 --> 00:35:01.490
that we hope should allow the
much more widespread adoption

00:35:01.490 --> 00:35:05.300
of automation to build databases
of reproducible chemical

00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:06.890
reaction data.

00:35:06.890 --> 00:35:08.360
The goal that
Alex, and Benjamin,

00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:10.790
I set, and Miles Ingram, who's
the new Radcliffe research

00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:13.220
partner who just started
this week on this project,

00:35:13.220 --> 00:35:15.530
is to make this cheap
enough that a primarily

00:35:15.530 --> 00:35:18.800
undergraduate institution can
easily adopt these automation

00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:21.410
processes and incorporate
them into their labs

00:35:21.410 --> 00:35:25.250
in training their students
and in generating data sets.

00:35:25.250 --> 00:35:27.350
Integrating automated
sugar and peptide synthesis

00:35:27.350 --> 00:35:30.121
is ongoing with now, these
much more affordable building

00:35:30.121 --> 00:35:30.620
blocks.

00:35:30.620 --> 00:35:33.290
So we're quite excited about
looking at and exploring

00:35:33.290 --> 00:35:35.162
this glycopeptide space now.

00:35:35.162 --> 00:35:36.620
And then, ultimately
of course, I'd

00:35:36.620 --> 00:35:39.350
like to be able to do enough
chemistry to start developing

00:35:39.350 --> 00:35:41.840
rules to predict the
reactivities of all

00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:44.120
those different sugar
structures I've shown you.

00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:46.105
And that's where
I think automation

00:35:46.105 --> 00:35:48.180
and artificial intelligence
algorithms are really

00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:49.400
going to be needed.

00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:51.290
But for that, we need the data.

00:35:51.290 --> 00:35:55.165
And so the automation,
we're one step closer

00:35:55.165 --> 00:35:57.290
to being able to get that
reproducible data that we

00:35:57.290 --> 00:35:59.150
can start to machine read.

00:35:59.150 --> 00:36:01.790
And so with that, only
thing left for me to do

00:36:01.790 --> 00:36:04.160
is thank the many researchers
that has helped me.

00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:08.420
This is my research group back
at Indiana who's helped me.

00:36:08.420 --> 00:36:11.420
Here's Miles and Benjamin, who
are Radcliffe research partners

00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:14.420
along with Alex in the
Pentelute Lab at MIT.

00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:16.490
The various funding sources.

00:36:16.490 --> 00:36:20.000
And that basically
is part of the joy

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.760
of being a professor is working
with a lot of talented students

00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:23.684
from around the world.

00:36:23.684 --> 00:36:25.850
So with that, I'd be very
happy to answer questions.

00:36:25.850 --> 00:36:27.700
Thank you.
