00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:01.810
Welcome back.

00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:05.689
In this lesson, we're going to go over
online customer acquisition techniques.

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:08.920
You can achieve many different goals
with online advertising but we'll be

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:13.010
focusing on customer acquisition rather
than brand awareness, for example.

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:15.940
&gt;&gt; So we're going to divide
this lesson into two parts.

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:16.870
Now in the first half,

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:20.430
we're going to talk about paid
tools to acquire new customers.

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.880
Such as SEM, programmatic media buying,
affiliate marketing,

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.080
social media marketing,
which includes video marketing.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.990
&gt;&gt; Then we'll go into free
customer acquisition tools and

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.180
talk about engaging
with your community and

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.890
inbound marketing including content
generation and email marketing.

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.590
So let's get started with
some background information

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:41.370
about the three engines of growth.
