00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.590
Hello I’m Daven Hiskey, you’re watching
the Today I Found Out YouTube channel.

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:11.929
In the video today, we’re looking at that
time the MI6 used s*m*n as invisible ink…

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:16.750
The British Secret Intelligence Service, better
known to the world as MI6 (Military Intelligence,

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:22.010
Section 6), is, rather oddly for a supposedly
secretive agency, one of the better known

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:24.010
intelligence services in the world.

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:29.369
While the work MI6 does today is top-secret,
thanks to the wonders of the Freedom of Information

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.600
Act, we’re able to peer into the mysterious
agency’s beginnings and marvel at all the

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.129
humourous things they did in their early days
in the name of protecting British interests-

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.179
like the time they told agents to use their
own s*m*n as ink when sending secret messages.

00:00:43.179 --> 00:00:47.100
We should probably mention at this point that
the head of the agency telling the agents

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.750
to do this was the aptly named Mansfield Smith-Cumming...

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:51.750
We can’t make this stuff up.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.190
The history of MI6 can be traced back to 1909
where a precursor to the agency was set up

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.749
by the British government to investigate German
citizens who were increasingly being accused

00:01:00.749 --> 00:01:02.829
of being spies by the paranoid public.

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:07.040
(In fact, there was a growing sentiment that
pretty much all German born individuals in

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.409
Britain were spies.)

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:13.000
As mentioned, the head of this fledgling agency,
then known as the Secret Service Bureau, was

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.250
one Mansfield Smith-Cumming, a legendary figure
in British military history, famed as much

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.820
for his eccentricities as he was for his accomplishments
as the first director of MI6.

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:28.400
Smith-Cumming, or "C" as he was affectionately
known during his tenure as director (originally

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.460
standing for "Cumming", rather than "Chief"
as it does today when referring to an MI6

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.289
director), was formerly a royal navy captain
who suffered from severe seasickness...

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:42.569
As you might imagine, this ultimately resulted
in him being deemed unfit for service.

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:47.040
As to why he was chosen to head up the new
spy agency, this seems to have been primarily

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.020
due to his impressive intelligence gathering
background.

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.180
For instance, in his post-naval captain career,
he was once tasked with gathering certain

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.829
information while posing as a German businessman
in Germany and the Balkans.

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.070
Why's that impressive?

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.859
He reportedly succeeded in his mission despite
not being able to speak a word of German.

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:09.190
As to the spy organisation he led, in the
beginning they were less James Bond and more

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:14.819
a sort of Monty Python caricature of spying;
bumbling buffoonery and gathering false intelligence

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.250
and presenting it as fact become a staple
of MI6.

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.269
For example, prior to World War 1, C's foremost
weapons expert disappeared for a time while

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:24.269
abroad.

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:28.030
Perhaps captured by some foreign power?

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.060
Nope- the agent couldn’t find anyone who
could give him directions in English and ultimately

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.410
became thoroughly lost.

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:38.500
On another occasion, C was reportedly fooled
by a phony document stating that German spies

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.430
had extra rows of teeth.

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.640
He also once spent a considerable amount of
the Agency’s scant resources searching Britain

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.400
for a hidden cache of German weapons that
simply didn’t exist.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.909
One notable "victory" C achieved in these
early days was a comprehensive file he compiled

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:54.470
on Zeppelins.

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.659
Apparently none of his superiors realised
that all the information was publicly available

00:02:58.659 --> 00:02:59.900
at the time.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.931
All C did was have it translated from German
to English; this report was hailed as a major

00:03:04.931 --> 00:03:07.590
victory for the British intelligence agency.

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.910
When the First World War broke out, the Secret
Service Bureau was overhauled and rebranded

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.319
as MI6, not that anyone publicly knew.

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:18.819
At this time, the British Government still
denied that it existed.

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:23.030
As you might imagine, the agency being a secret
made it hard to get good applicants.

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.610
When potential new agents were identified,
C had a novel way of interviewing them without

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.540
giving away that he worked for a shadowy government
agency.

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:36.140
In short, a key facet of the selection process
was the gold monocled director suddenly stabbing

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:37.219
himself in the leg.

00:03:37.219 --> 00:03:42.650
You see, in 1914 C lost his leg during a traffic
collision in France which tragically claimed

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:43.950
the life of his son.

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.579
While hospital reports indicate that his leg
was amputated the day after the accident,

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:52.260
C himself liked to claim that he cut it off
himself with a pen-knife in order to be able

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.019
to get to his dying son.

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:57.510
At other times, he'd say he lost it in a fight
with a wild animal.

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.750
After the accident, C mostly got around with
the aid of a wooden leg and a sword (hidden

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:02.750
inside of a cane).

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:07.569
In any event, C would interview potential
agents pretending he worked for a more mundane

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:09.060
facet of the government.

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:14.400
With the process moving along at a slothful
pace, in true Monty Python-skit fashion, without

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.510
warning, he'd suddenly violently stab himself
in his covered wooden leg mid-conversation.

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:23.740
If the person flinched, the interview was
over and the individual was asked to leave.

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.060
(Akin to the old "two for flinching tactic"...)

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:28.830
The flinchers clearly weren't secret agent
material.

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:33.080
If they kept their composure, he’d reveal
the true nature of the interview.

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:38.060
(C apparently found the reactions he sometimes
got from doing this so amusing that he reportedly

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.870
also used to do it during regular state meetings.)

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:42.730
So where does s*m*n come into this?

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:48.140
Well, like any respectable spymaster, C was
very interested in covert communication- in

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:49.850
particular invisible ink.

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:54.130
However, a key problem was that most fluids
that could function as an invisible ink and

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:57.930
the methods that could be used to reveal them
were widely known.

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:03.260
To solve the problem, in 1915 C approached
scientists at London University and tasked

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.140
them with discovering a new type of invisible
ink.

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:10.460
According to C’s own diaries, though, s*m*n’s
use as an invisible ink wasn’t discovered

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.400
by anyone at the university.

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:17.570
Instead, one of his agents, whose name is
omitted from his diary for obvious reasons,

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:19.040
made the breakthrough.

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:22.690
After investigation, it really did turn out
that, along with being a substance readily

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:27.640
available to any male agent, when exposed
to the usual detection methods of the time,

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:33.030
such as iodine vapour, letters penned with
s*m*n as ink refused to surrender their contents.

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:37.650
C was apparently thrilled to learn of this
use for s*m*n, allegedly quipping that “now

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:39.500
every man has his own stylo”.

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:43.880
An altered version "every man his own stylo"
was adopted by the agents as their motto for

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.030
a time.

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:49.321
Despite making a discovery that allowed British
agents to communicate covertly, the agent

00:05:49.321 --> 00:05:53.940
who discovered this was so teased by other
agents after the fact that he had to be moved

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:55.330
to a different department.

00:05:55.330 --> 00:06:00.210
Understandably, the use of s*m*n to pen secret
messages led to some hilarious exchanges,

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:05.190
such as one between an agent in Copenhagen
called Major Holme and C’s subordinate,

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:06.280
Frank Stagg.

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:10.460
In the message, Stagg was forced to tell Holme
that “a fresh operation was necessary for

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:14.910
each letter” after people in his office
began complaining that all Holme's letters

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:15.910
stank.

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:20.180
You see, Major Holme had decided to stock
up a large supply of "ink" in an inkwell so

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:24.400
he didn't need to do what was necessary to
get fresh "ink" every time he wanted to send

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:25.520
a secret letter.

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:29.640
So to sum up, during the First World War,
actual British spies had a meeting with a

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:34.740
one-legged, gold-monocled, cane-sword carrying
guy called Captain Cumming, during which he

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:38.970
enthusiastically told them they needed to
start using their own s*m*n as an invisible

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:43.750
ink- requiring that anytime they needed to
send a secret message, they had to masturbate

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:45.890
immediately before doing so...

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:48.480
Bonus Facts:
• According to Ian Flemming, the original

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:53.270
author of the James Bond series, the eccentric
quartermaster, M, is based on Mansfield-Cumming.

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:56.650
(Incidentally, Flemming also wrote Chitty
Chitty Bang Bang.)

00:06:56.650 --> 00:07:00.380
Also, the name “James Bond” is actually
that of an ornithologist.

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:05.410
Originally, Fleming wanted James bond to be
a boring, ordinary man who happened to experience

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:07.140
some extraordinary things.

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:11.520
He knew about an ornithologist named James
Bond from Bond’s book, Birds of the West

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:15.310
Indies, which he had read in his youth and
thought the author’s name was one of the

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:17.370
most boring names he’d ever heard.

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:21.150
Thanks to Flemming, the boring name soon became
rather exciting.

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:25.860
Mrs. Ornithologist Bond actually sent Fleming
a letter thanking him for using the name.

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:29.300
