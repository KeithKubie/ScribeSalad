00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.190
-I am Kristiana Kahakauwila
and I'm a fellow here,

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.530
the Lisa Goldberg Fellow
at the Radcliffe Institute.

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:21.020
And it's a delight
and great gift

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.010
to be able to introduce Luci
Tapahonso the inaugural poet

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:27.540
laureate of the Navajo Nation.

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:31.950
I'd like to begin by honoring
the Wampanoag, Massachusetts,

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:35.706
and other area tribes on whose
land we gather this afternoon.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.710
I first came to Luci's
writing a couple of years

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.070
ago when I was
looking for examples

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:50.740
of communal storytelling of how
community's or family's talk

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.130
story time, as we
Hawaiians might put it,

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:57.100
could be translated
onto the page.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.790
When I discovered
Luci's books, I

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:04.230
found the intimacy of that
talk story time recreated

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:05.950
in the written line.

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.460
The act of reading, usually
done individually, silently,

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.970
felt, with Luci's writing,
to be communal and raucous,

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.870
as if the entire household of
relatives was there speaking,

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:23.790
and I, the reader, were
inside the hogan with them.

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.040
And if in her writing
I was surrounded

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.840
by the voices of her community,
her husband and daughters,

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.910
her grandchildren and
parents, her grandmother

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.320
and great grandmother
and sisters and brothers,

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.700
I also had such a sense
of Luci's writerly voice--

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.090
the clarity of it, these
clean, straightforward lines,

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.940
and words that conveyed
to me not just happening--

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.910
the fact of a moment-- but
its visceral experience

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:55.840
and meaning, as well.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.800
Indeed, when Luci discusses her
relationship with storytelling,

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.800
she highlights the
power of words.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.530
In an interview with
Mojave poet Natalie Diaz,

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:12.250
Luci said, "In Navajo, the
idea of words or language

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.520
is really our origin.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.990
We were created by words,
and we survived by words.

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.470
Everything that
comprises a Navajo person

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.760
is based on words-- your
clan, where you come from,

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.480
how the world was created."

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.940
She goes on, "They say that when
the world was first created,

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.840
the holy people
thought about it,

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.390
then organized their thoughts,
and then their thoughts

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.160
were expressed in words.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.250
As they spoke, the Navajo
idea of the world or universe

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.500
was created."

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.320
Certainly the language of
Luci's poems and stories begets

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.630
universes-- those of Shiprock,
New Mexico and Lawrence,

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.770
Kansas, of her lifetime
and lifetimes long ago.

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.320
She suggests, also,
universes of emotion,

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.800
from the sly humor
and two-stepping

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.900
meter of In Praise of Texas to
the wistful ode to her brothers

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.500
in These Long Drives.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.260
To read Luci's
poems is to tumble

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.220
into a multitude of
universes all connected

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.350
by her use of language and a
deep sense of the aliveness

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.630
of the Navajo people.

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.330
Luci Tapahonso is descended
from Bitter Water Clan on her

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.880
father's side and Salt
Water Clan on her mother's.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.370
She was born in
Shiprock, New Mexico

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.420
and grew up in a
family of 11 children.

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.670
Her first language is
Navajo, though as she told us

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.460
yesterday, her parents taught
her English numbers and letters

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:50.340
prior to her starting school
at the Navajo Methodist

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.310
Mission, a boarding
school in Farmington,

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.650
some 30 miles from Shiprock.

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.860
She began her career
as a reporter,

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.970
and in an interview with the
Los Angeles Review of Books

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:05.290
said of those more
youthful days that she was,

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.820
"Out there with aim,
running around."

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.310
In 1976 she enrolled
at the University

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:15.130
of New Mexico where she
earned her BA and MA

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:17.070
and became a
professor of English,

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.410
Women's Studies, and
American Indian Studies.

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:23.180
She would go on to teach
at the University of Kansas

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.760
where she was key in
establishing the Indigenous

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.460
Studies graduate
studies program,

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.730
and at the University
of Arizona in Tucson.

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:33.720
Today she has returned
to the University

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.570
of New Mexico as a professor
and the director of their MFA

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.880
program in Creative Writing.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.810
Her first book was
published in 1981,

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.070
a year after she
graduated with her BA--

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.850
that we all could be so lucky.

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:52.610
Since then she has published
five more collections

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:57.370
of poetry and short stories as
well as three children's books.

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.470
Her numerous awards
and recognitions

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:01.760
include a Lifetime
Achievement Award

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.790
from the Native Writer's
Circle of the Americas,

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:07.520
Storyteller of the
Year by the Word Craft

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.280
Circle of Native Writers,
and the Region Book

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:14.780
Award from the Mountain and
Plains Booksellers Association.

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:17.290
She has also served on
the Board of Trustees

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:20.170
in the National Museum
of the American Indian

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:25.090
and is a juror for the
Poetry Society of America.

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:29.280
In 2013 when she was named
inaugural poet of the Navajo

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:33.360
Nation, she, in
speaking of this honor,

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.530
hearkened back to the
idea of community.

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:40.150
For me, she said, "To
think about the laureate is

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:44.290
like that same idea of
honor-- how people use words,

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:47.860
words that aren't really mine,
that are from our language,

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:51.950
from our history-- is not
even really me, you know.

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:54.880
It is everything that
people over the generations

00:05:54.880 --> 00:06:00.105
and over the centuries
have deemed beautiful."

00:06:00.105 --> 00:06:00.730
Luci Tapahonso.

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:26.340
Thank you so much.

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:27.940
It's very much an honor.

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:54.500
[SPEAKING NAVAJO]

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:55.670
Good afternoon.

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:59.740
I'm very honored
to be here, and I

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:06.410
want to express my gratitude
to Shelley and Paul

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:11.580
and Ellen, both Ellens, and
everyone else who has been

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:16.210
instrumental in my visit here.

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:22.110
And I want to say thank you
to my grandson, my son, Damon.

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:25.440
He's been a really
good Indian guide.

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:31.980
I want to begin this
afternoon by reading

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:39.650
a poem for my intelligent and
lovely granddaughter, Brianna.

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:45.840
She arrived yesterday, and I
haven't seen her since January,

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:50.810
so it's really nice
to be with her.

00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:52.100
This is called [NAVAJO].

00:07:57.770 --> 00:08:01.580
For Brianna [NAVAJO].

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:03.450
Thank you.

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:08.710
She was born on a bright fall
afternoon, already chubby

00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:11.180
and quivering with wetness.

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:15.510
She gasped for air and for
her mother's warm body.

00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:20.260
Her name is She Who
Brings Happiness because

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:23.330
upon being carried,
she instinctively

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:27.910
settles into the warmth
of your shoulder and neck.

00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:33.440
She nestles like a little bird
into the contours of your body.

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:38.320
All you can say
is, she's so sweet.

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:41.590
I don't know what to do.

00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:45.130
And we smile, beaming
with pleasure.

00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:49.500
She sleeps even breaths
and milky sighs just

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:51.540
below your ear.

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:54.060
Other times she
snuggles into you

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:58.020
and watches with
bright, dark eyes.

00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:02.320
It feels so much like
the trust we have somehow

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:05.220
forgotten over the years.

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:10.770
All you can do is kiss
her warm forehead and say,

00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:12.960
she's so sweet.

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:15.880
I don't know what to do.

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:20.630
Sometimes when I haven't seen
her for a day or even a week,

00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:25.320
she runs to me, her arms
straight out for balance,

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:27.500
and hugs my legs.

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:31.800
"My gamma," she
murmurs into my skirt.

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:34.553
Then she holds her
arms up and says,

00:09:34.553 --> 00:09:37.870
"ah, ah," and I pick her up.

00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:41.210
She snuggles into me, sighing.

00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:43.275
Then I tell her, [NAVAJO].

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:51.430
My little one, my
daughter's child,

00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:54.450
what happiness you are to me.

00:09:54.450 --> 00:10:01.110
She cries a little like the
infant she no longer is.

00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:06.360
And I hold her like the sweet
surprise she will always be.

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:09.673
We sit like that a
while, then she hums.

00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:16.800
I take the hint and sing the old
lullaby her great grandmother

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:20.020
sang to the child I once was.

00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:43.840
[SINGING]

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:48.080
She shifts on my lap
saying, star, star.

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:50.720
We turn to the twinkling
Christmas lights

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:56.920
still up in July and sing
Twinkle Twinkle Little Star.

00:10:56.920 --> 00:11:00.910
She falls asleep and I hand
her to her mother, saying,

00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:03.010
she's so sweet.

00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:05.520
I don't know what to do.

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:08.320
Now each time she
toddles into the room,

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:14.390
we turn around and say,
[NAVAJO]-- you want some juice?

00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:16.536
How about milk?

00:11:16.536 --> 00:11:20.320
She Who Brings Happiness
smiles and climbs

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:22.700
onto the nearest lap.

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:26.485
As she snuggles comfortably into
the circle around the table,

00:11:26.485 --> 00:11:30.400
we murmur, she's so sweet.

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:32.262
We don't know what to do.

00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:44.350
Thank you.

00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:51.830
Brianna is now on a
congressional internship in DC.

00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:55.710
And she still is so sweet.

00:11:55.710 --> 00:12:00.420
I just love having family
with me when I travel

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:02.555
and have these kinds of events.

00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:13.720
It's just so comforting,
and I'm not as nervous

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:17.720
as I might be otherwise.

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:23.870
This is a poem called-- it's not
really a poem, it's a letter.

00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:27.550
A couple of years ago,
NPR asked me to take part

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:31.920
in a series which was
called State of the Reunion,

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:34.390
and they asked a
number of writers

00:12:34.390 --> 00:12:39.270
from across the country to write
letters to their hometowns.

00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:41.510
So it was perfect for me.

00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:45.444
So this is a letter that I
wrote to Shiprock, my hometown.

00:12:48.290 --> 00:12:52.430
Dear Shiprock, my home, my
land, my mother, [NAVAJO].

00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:03.700
I introduce myself again as a
[NAVAJO] from the Mesa farms.

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:06.790
I am from Shiprock,
the huge rock

00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:11.020
formation whose name
translates into tall leader,

00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:13.130
or the rock with wings.

00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:26.360
[SPEAKING NAVAJO]

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:30.360
Shiprock, I am one of
your thousands of children

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:34.120
who will always honor your
dark blue silhouette that

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:39.550
is surrounded by flat land, the
shallow San Juan River, fields,

00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:42.610
orchards, and
irrigation ditches.

00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:43.920
Remember me?

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:48.930
I grew up on First Lane on a
seemingly nondescript farm,

00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:53.280
but we were taught that we were
wealthy because of our fields

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:55.340
and animals.

00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:59.690
Oh, Shiprock, as a tall
leader you remain resolute,

00:13:59.690 --> 00:14:04.100
towering into the
empty New Mexico sky.

00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:08.620
You are the echo of a time
when eagles spoke to us

00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:10.430
and nurtured us.

00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:13.760
Long ago you brought
us here, rescuing us

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:18.660
from a whirl of horrendous
floods and Roman monsters.

00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:23.250
We nestle, then, in
the V of your huge,

00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:30.240
golden wings, secure in that
warm, instinctual place,

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:34.480
secure here in that warm,
instinctual cradle now known

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:36.480
as [NAVAJO].

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:40.600
Our Navajo memories treasure
that smooth [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:46.390
long ago, and the soft landing
near the thin, clear river.

00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:51.060
Our name became
[NAVAJO], people of water

00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:56.570
in honor of the river that
would ensure our livelihood.

00:14:56.570 --> 00:15:01.090
Thus to be from Shiprock,
to be a [NAVAJO]

00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:06.110
is to know ourselves as
ancient and resilient.

00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:11.800
We strive daily to embody the
ways of [NAVAJO]-- kindness,

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:16.640
strength, compassion-- and
to remember all living things

00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:19.420
understand kinship.

00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:22.780
Each morning the holy
ones arrive at sunrise

00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:25.220
with blessing songs.

00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:29.810
Then at dusk they enfold
us in gentle blankets

00:15:29.810 --> 00:15:36.220
of brilliant colors wrought from
the mountain, sunlight, fields,

00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:38.440
and stars.

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:39.660
Shiprock [NAVAJO].

00:15:42.890 --> 00:15:47.020
To say your name
recalls old stories,

00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:51.800
treasured memories of family,
relatives, and friends.

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:57.440
Your names are replete with
hugs, tears, and laughter.

00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:59.530
[NAVAJO]

00:15:59.530 --> 00:16:03.320
The days are crisp
and cold again.

00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:06.240
The Navajo new year has begun.

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:10.080
The blending of fall
and winter calls forth

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:16.130
the ceremonies of [NAVAJO],
grandfathers of the holy ones.

00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:19.850
They pray and sing in
the frost-filled nights.

00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:22.610
They dance again
for our renewal--

00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:27.250
the plants, animals,
fields, and our good health.

00:16:27.250 --> 00:16:30.600
Once again they
sing the old stories

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:33.290
and the blessings
of our ancestors

00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:37.010
within the watchful
view of Shiprock.

00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:45.430
Thank you [NAVAJO] Shiprock,
for your enduring presence

00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:47.540
and the lasting
reminder that we are

00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:53.830
cared for and looked after no
matter where we may travel.

00:16:53.830 --> 00:16:59.330
Yours sincerely, Luci Tapahonso.

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:00.552
Thank you.

00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:22.530
Earlier today, or
maybe it was yesterday,

00:17:22.530 --> 00:17:28.010
I talked about poetry
and form and how much

00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:32.870
I love form, writing in a
Western, traditional form.

00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:37.010
When I was in school, when
I was an undergraduate,

00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:41.510
I was studying poetry-- or
maybe in graduate school--

00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:44.490
and I was really
daunted and put off

00:17:44.490 --> 00:17:52.820
by having to learn and
memorize Western poetry, poetry

00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:56.800
from Europe, that
originated in Europe.

00:17:56.800 --> 00:18:02.730
And I just couldn't understand
the language, the form.

00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:05.890
I just couldn't understand it.

00:18:05.890 --> 00:18:11.570
And so I knew that
I had to learn it

00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:12.972
like I was getting a grade.

00:18:16.670 --> 00:18:20.800
And I remember talking to
my mother, and I told her,

00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:23.970
I don't know what I'm
going to do because it's

00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:25.710
really hard for me.

00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:29.000
I said, it's already
kind of hard to always

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.140
be writing in English,
but to understand

00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:37.220
old English is really hard.

00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:44.460
And she just listened to
me and she said, well,

00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:47.080
whenever you can-- this is
when I was in Albuquerque--

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:51.010
she said, come home and let's
arrange a prayer for you.

00:18:51.010 --> 00:18:53.340
She said, because
maybe that's what

00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:56.030
you need is just to come
home and have some prayers

00:18:56.030 --> 00:18:59.770
and listen to some songs.

00:18:59.770 --> 00:19:03.990
And let us just all get
together for you to help you.

00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:07.900
And she didn't really
have an understanding

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:11.200
of what I meant except that
I was having a hard time.

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:18.070
So they did, they arranged
for a ceremony for me,

00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:20.820
and had the medicine man
tell all my relatives

00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:22.480
and everything.

00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:26.880
And so I came back and I think
it lasted 2 nights, maybe

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:29.220
3 nights, so we
stayed up all night.

00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:33.130
And as part of that, when the
medicine man says the prayer,

00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:35.490
you have to repeat after him.

00:19:35.490 --> 00:19:43.290
So it's really kind of strenuous
if you're not used to it.

00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:46.810
But overall, there's,
like, I don't know,

00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:49.940
40 or 50 people that
gathered for you,

00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:54.940
and they're all praying and
they're all there for you.

00:19:54.940 --> 00:20:00.110
And so I remember when
I was repeating things

00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:02.950
after the medicine man,
I just had my eyes closed

00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:04.970
and I was repeating after him.

00:20:04.970 --> 00:20:08.002
Then when he was
singing and praying,

00:20:08.002 --> 00:20:12.040
I had my eyes closed
and I was thinking

00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:15.130
his voice is really rhythmic.

00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:17.470
It's poetic, he's
repeating things.

00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:20.213
In Navajo you repeat
things four times.

00:20:20.213 --> 00:20:23.020
I was just thinking
about that, and then I

00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:25.450
thought, what if that
was written down?

00:20:25.450 --> 00:20:27.170
And as I was listening
to his voice,

00:20:27.170 --> 00:20:31.440
I could visualize in my
mind what it looked like.

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:36.375
And then I realized it looked
like a fixed form poem.

00:20:36.375 --> 00:20:38.380
And I thought, oh.

00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:41.560
And it was all in Navajo.

00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:47.040
And he was praying things
that were-- we don't even

00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:48.750
know the beginning
of them, but it

00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:52.620
was the exact same
as my ancestors

00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:57.790
and my parents, that
had been prayed for them

00:20:57.790 --> 00:21:02.050
and given to them, and then
it was being done for me.

00:21:02.050 --> 00:21:05.340
And there was all these
people who loved me and wanted

00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:07.340
only the best for me.

00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:10.240
It was such a liberation.

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:14.510
I can't tell you
how grateful I was.

00:21:14.510 --> 00:21:19.930
So then I went back and I saw
it with a new appreciation

00:21:19.930 --> 00:21:28.690
because I knew that this form
that I was trying to study--

00:21:28.690 --> 00:21:32.800
my knowledge and my
prayers and my words

00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:38.260
were older than what
I was trying to learn.

00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:41.410
So then it was a breeze.

00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:44.240
I just had to
understand the concept

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:47.440
and see how it
was related to me.

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:51.140
After that, then I really
appreciated everything

00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:55.090
I did because I could see it
through the lenses of a Navajo

00:21:55.090 --> 00:21:56.410
person.

00:21:56.410 --> 00:22:00.500
Not as a person that's
foreign to the language,

00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:02.940
but to understand
that they, too,

00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:05.140
loved and appreciated language.

00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:10.860
They, too, memorize those
words, and we have them today.

00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:13.910
So anyway, then after
that, I was writing

00:22:13.910 --> 00:22:17.050
sonnets and villanelles.

00:22:17.050 --> 00:22:20.080
And my favor is a sestina,
which I'm going to read now.

00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:24.240
A sestina, as you may know,
is called a song of sixes.

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:26.950
It uses six words in
their particular order,

00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:29.860
has six stanzas.

00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:33.110
There are six words that
appear at the end of each line.

00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:35.490
Then it ends with a
three-line stanza,

00:22:35.490 --> 00:22:39.120
which three of the
words are in the center

00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:41.890
and the other three are
at the end of the line.

00:22:41.890 --> 00:22:44.080
And then what made
it even better was I

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:46.085
was able to use
Navajo and English.

00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:50.350
This was made for me.

00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:59.210
This is called [NAVAJO],
and the meaning

00:22:59.210 --> 00:23:04.080
becomes clear at the end.

00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:07.690
Sometimes this guy
just makes me laugh.

00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:11.100
Just as easily he
can make me see red,

00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:16.990
like when he tries to run off
as if he thirsts for freedom.

00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:21.230
Anyway, he needs me
like a dog needs a pack.

00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:24.770
Besides, he loves
my crew cab truck.

00:23:24.770 --> 00:23:27.210
When he first
noticed my jewelry,

00:23:27.210 --> 00:23:30.370
I became the woman for him.

00:23:30.370 --> 00:23:33.880
Not only that, but
because I'm a Dine woman,

00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:37.490
his life revolves around me.

00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:41.480
Now he recognizes my
laugh from a distance.

00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:44.530
Sometimes we go for
rides in the truck

00:23:44.530 --> 00:23:48.310
down winding river
road as the sky fills

00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:51.300
with purple and red streaks.

00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:56.330
To the south, people walk along
the rialto, their dog's noses

00:23:56.330 --> 00:23:58.360
bent to the ground.

00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:02.650
The dogs are
excited and thirsty.

00:24:02.650 --> 00:24:06.580
A Diet Coke is enough
to quench my thirst.

00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:09.880
In the southwest, the
quintessential pleasures

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:16.350
for women are a faithful car,
good music, and good stories.

00:24:16.350 --> 00:24:20.780
We're not dogged by having
to drive hundreds of miles.

00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:25.340
We just reminisce, laugh,
and sometimes sing.

00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:30.720
During trips north to Shiprock,
dust turns everything red

00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:35.930
as the vast Salt River
Canyon welcomes my truck.

00:24:35.930 --> 00:24:41.170
It is, as we used to
say, we keep on trucking

00:24:41.170 --> 00:24:44.340
through whatever
may come our way.

00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:48.980
Our thirst for stories
and laughter never ceases.

00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:53.440
Once I read that and
animals make life complete,

00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:56.430
but a woman like me
needs more than that,

00:24:56.430 --> 00:24:58.770
I thought, and laughed.

00:24:58.770 --> 00:25:02.320
Then I remembered the
cats, rabbits, chickens,

00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:05.200
and dogs of my childhood.

00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:10.710
How Lobo, Snazzy and Tlog'i
didn't seem like dogs.

00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:15.870
They listened ever alert while
lying under Daddy's truck.

00:25:15.870 --> 00:25:19.260
They probably
never really slept.

00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:24.640
Sometimes they even seemed to
laugh when we spoke English.

00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:27.080
But back to this other guy.

00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:33.040
He thirsts to be near me
even when I'm driving.

00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:36.680
Move over, I say.

00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:41.230
A women needs space
and no distractions.

00:25:41.230 --> 00:25:45.880
Sit on your side before
red lights come flashing.

00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:49.310
I'll be handcuffed
and read my rights,

00:25:49.310 --> 00:25:50.840
and you won't even care.

00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:59.400
Act like a dog and look
out the window, I scold.

00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:03.250
He knows when a
woman means business.

00:26:03.250 --> 00:26:07.170
He moves slowly over to
the passenger side door

00:26:07.170 --> 00:26:13.380
and looks at me, his dark, shiny
eyes thirsty for affection.

00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:18.060
He gets that same look
when I laugh unexpectedly,

00:26:18.060 --> 00:26:23.950
and he doesn't laugh when I talk
English, like those res dogs.

00:26:23.950 --> 00:26:30.800
But those dogs instilled
in me a thirst for a sleek,

00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:37.210
little dog-- [NAVAJO]-- who
loves trucks and lives only

00:26:37.210 --> 00:26:39.760
to make his mom a happy woman.

00:26:49.550 --> 00:26:50.130
Thank you.

00:26:50.130 --> 00:26:51.890
This is about my little dog.

00:26:51.890 --> 00:26:54.932
His name was Max [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:54.932 --> 00:27:00.760
He was a Miniature Pinscher,
and he stuck with me

00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:03.440
for the whole 12
years of his life.

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:08.260
He was my little buddy, and he
used to go to readings with me.

00:27:08.260 --> 00:27:10.960
And I would hold him, and
then when I was signing books,

00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:12.325
he would sit on my lap.

00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:20.650
He was my little
guy, and now we still

00:27:20.650 --> 00:27:23.950
have his little brother, Buddy.

00:27:23.950 --> 00:27:27.610
He's really my husband's dog.

00:27:27.610 --> 00:27:30.820
So Max could really
understand Navajo.

00:27:30.820 --> 00:27:36.150
Buddy, not really, but we
always say that Buddy's name

00:27:36.150 --> 00:27:37.300
is Buddy [? Martin ?].

00:27:42.370 --> 00:27:44.360
Because his breed, a
Miniature Pinscher,

00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:50.990
originated in Germany, so we
gave him a little German name,

00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:53.780
I think.

00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:55.830
So let's see.

00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:59.350
So I want to just read
a couple of things.

00:27:59.350 --> 00:28:07.750
I want to read this poem
about a trip to Italy,

00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:14.180
and it's called
Festival of the Onion.

00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:18.800
Fall mornings in Umbria
are veiled with dew.

00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:21.710
Roosters awaken the dawn.

00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:26.520
I hadn't heard that wake
up call since childhood.

00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:31.910
And there is coffee that
makes one happy to be alive.

00:28:31.910 --> 00:28:36.030
Delicate tiny cups filled
with the dark essence

00:28:36.030 --> 00:28:38.650
that means Italia.

00:28:38.650 --> 00:28:45.080
To drink this is to start the
day murmuring, graci, graci.

00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:47.820
From the balcony
where we eat breakfast

00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:53.480
we see olive groves cling to the
gentle hills in the distance.

00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:58.750
Transparent clouds pause
and rest on the rises.

00:28:58.750 --> 00:29:03.340
I breath the crisp air
and thank the holy ones.

00:29:03.340 --> 00:29:07.940
Later, arias drift
from a home nearby.

00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:11.640
The cobblestone lanes
are narrow and shiny

00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:14.490
from centuries of use.

00:29:14.490 --> 00:29:19.940
Tiny roads weave between
the old houses and castles.

00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:23.460
Walls are worn smooth
from the handiwork

00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:26.700
of families over the ages.

00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:30.520
The round corners and
slight indentations

00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:36.560
convey the tenderness of home
and long ago grandparents.

00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:41.990
One evening we attended an
onion festival in Camerino.

00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:46.930
It was like a miniature
Shiprock fair without the dusk

00:29:46.930 --> 00:29:48.780
and mutton.

00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:52.390
Parking was tight,
but by some miracle

00:29:52.390 --> 00:29:56.130
our host, Gaetano,
squeezed his little car

00:29:56.130 --> 00:30:01.730
into a space even
smaller than his car.

00:30:01.730 --> 00:30:06.460
I say miracle because
the actual maneuver

00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:12.230
was a blur of loud
arguing between our driver

00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:16.800
and concerned passers
by-- furious gestures

00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:24.120
mixed with spontaneous
groans and sighs.

00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:30.110
All this within 5 minutes,
then calmness reigned again.

00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:33.650
We had spent the
afternoon at Assisi.

00:30:33.650 --> 00:30:38.420
It became clear that St. Francis
had extended his compassion

00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:44.070
to Gaetano, who was received as
if he were the mayor everywhere

00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:46.190
we went.

00:30:46.190 --> 00:30:49.250
At this point, I'm
no longer panicked

00:30:49.250 --> 00:30:51.376
at the ordinary
Italian conversation.

00:30:55.120 --> 00:31:00.280
The first time the whole
table erupted into loud chaos,

00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:04.810
it seemed that a great
wrong had been uncovered.

00:31:04.810 --> 00:31:10.960
I was alarmed yet grateful
for the Dine inclination

00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:15.670
for sustained
silent observation.

00:31:15.670 --> 00:31:19.490
After everything
reached a fever pitch,

00:31:19.490 --> 00:31:23.120
calmness instantly descended.

00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:27.250
It was then I realized that
they were only figuring out

00:31:27.250 --> 00:31:29.625
the tip for the group's meal.

00:31:32.770 --> 00:31:36.260
At Camerino we wound
our way to the plaza

00:31:36.260 --> 00:31:41.200
where large tents bustled with
music, lights, and sizzling

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:45.510
meat, and huge pans
of onions cooked

00:31:45.510 --> 00:31:50.780
in every way imaginable
and unimaginable.

00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:56.930
The onion was the star
and we mere celebrants.

00:31:56.930 --> 00:32:01.080
That was the night we
lost Scott Momaday.

00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:06.020
We left Spello and planned
to sit together at one table

00:32:06.020 --> 00:32:11.580
as Gaetano negotiated
for a table of 13.

00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:16.190
The rest wandered out loud
where Dr. Momaday was.

00:32:16.190 --> 00:32:22.840
We call Carmen and Emma's
cell phones to no avail.

00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:25.470
The drive from
Spello was a matter

00:32:25.470 --> 00:32:29.490
of maneuvering in the
moonlight through dark fields

00:32:29.490 --> 00:32:35.440
and rolling hills of olives,
grapes, and fig trees.

00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:39.510
The narrow streets and
parking lots were searched.

00:32:39.510 --> 00:32:43.970
Finally there they were,
strolling towards us,

00:32:43.970 --> 00:32:48.010
all smile and casual greetings.

00:32:48.010 --> 00:32:51.320
Where were you, several
voices demanded.

00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:54.220
We thought you were lost.

00:32:54.220 --> 00:32:59.380
For Gaetano Prampolini,
to lose Scott Momaday

00:32:59.380 --> 00:33:04.170
would be the end of everything.

00:33:04.170 --> 00:33:07.630
Again there was a loud
eruption of questions,

00:33:07.630 --> 00:33:12.820
interrupted explanations,
demands, and defenses.

00:33:12.820 --> 00:33:15.670
Throughout all this,
Scott listened,

00:33:15.670 --> 00:33:19.150
leaning on his new walnut cane.

00:33:19.150 --> 00:33:21.900
He didn't look lost at all.

00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:25.130
But then, can a
man be lost if he

00:33:25.130 --> 00:33:28.980
is accompanied by three women?

00:33:28.980 --> 00:33:32.040
With the lost party
in place, we sat down

00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:36.930
to revel in the joys of
the onion as the night sky

00:33:36.930 --> 00:33:43.180
over Camerino filled with smoke,
music, laughter, and wine.

00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:48.670
We ate gratefully reunited,
savoring all varieties

00:33:48.670 --> 00:33:54.640
of roasted meats, succulent
potatoes, flavorful vegetables,

00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:57.240
and crusty breads.

00:33:57.240 --> 00:34:02.590
We happily paid tribute with
every bite and each story

00:34:02.590 --> 00:34:07.036
to the tangy, even sweet,
presence of the onion.

00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:15.350
Thank you.

00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:32.747
This is like choosing
between my children.

00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:43.730
I want to read a poem.

00:34:43.730 --> 00:34:50.320
This is called [NAVAJO], and
it means they are married

00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:53.270
or they are together.

00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:55.179
I want to read
this for my husband

00:34:55.179 --> 00:35:04.110
who is the President of
Institute of American Indian

00:35:04.110 --> 00:35:06.760
Arts in Sante Fe.

00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:10.860
And he has a really
busy schedule, too,

00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:17.390
so we planned to come
together, but he just came back

00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:19.466
from traveling and is
leaving again soon.

00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:27.980
In Navajo, the state of
relationships is interesting.

00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:34.150
I really did my own
research into this.

00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:39.850
The end of the poem
gives you the meaning.

00:35:39.850 --> 00:35:44.030
So anyway, [NAVAJO], and I'll
talk a little bit about it.

00:35:44.030 --> 00:35:48.220
It's not a grand thing after
all-- just that warm comfort

00:35:48.220 --> 00:35:51.110
and murmuring good
night before I

00:35:51.110 --> 00:35:57.490
sink into that dark quiet that
exists when we're together.

00:35:57.490 --> 00:36:01.780
Otherwise when I'm traveling,
the same good night

00:36:01.780 --> 00:36:04.980
on the phone, and
I listen intently.

00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:07.610
For what, I'm not sure.

00:36:07.610 --> 00:36:10.540
Have a light on for
safety, drift off

00:36:10.540 --> 00:36:14.660
to sleep half listening, a
little noise and I'm sitting up

00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:17.910
in bed surveying
the room-- sometimes

00:36:17.910 --> 00:36:22.280
even the entire block
from the hotel window.

00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:24.955
I rush to the phone
and double check.

00:36:24.955 --> 00:36:29.870
Should I dial 0 or 8911?

00:36:29.870 --> 00:36:33.030
I check the locks again,
then lie back down,

00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:36.640
afraid to sleep yet
wanting to sleep,

00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:40.650
knowing that fatigue will
be obvious in the morning.

00:36:40.650 --> 00:36:43.910
I've had so much practice.

00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:49.760
When we're together, locking
doors doesn't occur to me.

00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:53.110
Local crime seems
to be far away.

00:36:53.110 --> 00:36:56.550
Never mind that we are
in the heart of the city.

00:36:56.550 --> 00:37:01.080
I insist upon complete
darkness, and what I am sure of

00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:05.170
is that if I turn over,
your warm chest or arms with

00:37:05.170 --> 00:37:06.790
surround me.

00:37:06.790 --> 00:37:12.130
That should I awaken, confused
as to where I am once again,

00:37:12.130 --> 00:37:17.560
you will reach for me knowing
exactly how to reassure me.

00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:19.960
And when we drink
coffee together

00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:24.000
in this bright California
morning, mountains towering

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:29.120
around us, I move
closer to knowing what

00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:31.395
the creator meant by [NAVAJO].

00:37:34.890 --> 00:37:39.165
They are sitting beside each
other in a house of beauty.

00:37:44.010 --> 00:37:51.760
So they are sitting beside each
other inside a house of beauty.

00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:58.450
So when people are courting
or when they're just dating,

00:37:58.450 --> 00:38:05.300
they say [NAVAJO], and that
means you can't do that.

00:38:05.300 --> 00:38:07.230
When you literally
translate it, it

00:38:07.230 --> 00:38:10.730
means, like, they're holding
onto each other and kind

00:38:10.730 --> 00:38:16.480
of maybe stumbling or
dragging each other around.

00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:20.290
Like you're so in love, you're
just hanging on to each other

00:38:20.290 --> 00:38:22.540
and you can barely walk.

00:38:22.540 --> 00:38:27.660
But you can't do that
unless-- [NAVAJO]--

00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:31.310
you can't really do that-- I
mean, the description of it.

00:38:31.310 --> 00:38:33.600
You have to be outside.

00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:37.050
So it's like in the
moonlight, under the trees,

00:38:37.050 --> 00:38:38.990
behind buildings, whatever.

00:38:38.990 --> 00:38:41.060
It's like you're
outside, and then

00:38:41.060 --> 00:38:45.940
as you're becoming more
serious, the relationship

00:38:45.940 --> 00:38:50.190
begins to move
towards the interior.

00:38:50.190 --> 00:38:54.000
So when you're going
together, it means outside,

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:57.690
but then when you're married
and you're settled in together,

00:38:57.690 --> 00:39:01.410
that's when you're indoors.

00:39:01.410 --> 00:39:05.660
So it's just interesting
how relationships are

00:39:05.660 --> 00:39:09.110
described in different ways.

00:39:09.110 --> 00:39:12.890
So that's what I was
thinking about when

00:39:12.890 --> 00:39:18.830
I was-- that occurred to me
as I was writing this poem,

00:39:18.830 --> 00:39:26.930
that that was how relationships
are characterized.

00:39:26.930 --> 00:39:31.630
I really like thinking
about what Navajo words mean

00:39:31.630 --> 00:39:36.550
and where they originated,
all the different parts of it.

00:39:36.550 --> 00:39:42.260
It's so descriptive and so
visual and so emotion-driven

00:39:42.260 --> 00:39:47.940
that it has a whole
different concept

00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:51.190
than the word in English.

00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:56.790
So for instance, this next
poem is called [NAVAJO]

00:39:56.790 --> 00:40:02.710
and it refers to what we would
normally just call tortillas.

00:40:02.710 --> 00:40:05.700
When the weather is nice
we sit under the trees

00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:09.320
with covered bowls of
warm dough and make bread

00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:12.660
on grills set over
glowing ashes.

00:40:12.660 --> 00:40:15.250
More often we sit in
my mother's kitchen

00:40:15.250 --> 00:40:18.930
and take turns placing
flattened circles of dough

00:40:18.930 --> 00:40:20.840
on the hot griddle.

00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:24.880
The stack of bread alternately
grows, then shrinks,

00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:28.930
depending on how many
people are around.

00:40:28.930 --> 00:40:31.530
These days I drive home
in the darkened evening

00:40:31.530 --> 00:40:33.900
to a quiet house.

00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:37.950
The cats greet me with
a glance and a yawn.

00:40:37.950 --> 00:40:41.530
They look repeatedly
at their food bowls.

00:40:41.530 --> 00:40:44.260
They want canned food.

00:40:44.260 --> 00:40:47.610
It seems like everyone
wants something from me,

00:40:47.610 --> 00:40:51.320
I complain while
filling their bowls.

00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:55.950
Dexter Dudley Begay
purrs in response.

00:40:55.950 --> 00:41:00.650
I wish for beans or a warm stew,
but then I just wash my hands

00:41:00.650 --> 00:41:05.060
and line up ingredients as I
learned to do in home economics

00:41:05.060 --> 00:41:07.000
long ago.

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:10.920
Never start cooking without
everything being in order,

00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:14.000
Mrs. Bowman preached.

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:18.170
I mix the dough and cover
it, then let it sit a while.

00:41:18.170 --> 00:41:20.510
I change clothes,
turn on lights,

00:41:20.510 --> 00:41:23.220
and fix a glass of ice water.

00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:25.810
Then I search the
refrigerator for something

00:41:25.810 --> 00:41:29.050
to accompany the [NAVAJO].

00:41:29.050 --> 00:41:32.940
It goes with everything
and anything,

00:41:32.940 --> 00:41:37.920
my inner Martha
Stewart reassures me.

00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:42.300
The process is simple-- take
a few handfuls of flour,

00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:47.170
preferably Blue Bird or Navajo
Pride, toss with a bit of salt

00:41:47.170 --> 00:41:50.910
and a palm full of
baking powder, mix well.

00:41:50.910 --> 00:41:54.190
Ponder the next ingredient
a while, but then go ahead

00:41:54.190 --> 00:41:57.690
and add two finger tips
of lard-- not too much,

00:41:57.690 --> 00:42:00.170
just enough to help the texture.

00:42:00.170 --> 00:42:05.450
Mix very well, then pour in 1
and 1/2 cups of very hot water

00:42:05.450 --> 00:42:07.110
and mix quickly.

00:42:07.110 --> 00:42:11.910
Mix until the dough forms a soft
ball and the remaining flour

00:42:11.910 --> 00:42:14.940
lifts away from the
sides of the ball.

00:42:14.940 --> 00:42:19.160
Rub olive oil on a griddle
and heat until very warm.

00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:22.010
Then take a ball of dough
and slap it into a disk.

00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:28.220
Stretch it gently while,
slapping it back and forth

00:42:28.220 --> 00:42:30.590
from hand to hand.

00:42:30.590 --> 00:42:33.680
After a few minutes,
a rhythm emerges

00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:38.560
from the soft muffled slapping
combined with the pauses

00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:40.790
to lay the dough on the griddle.

00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:42.400
Flip it over.

00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:47.100
It's removal from the hot grill
and it's quick replacement.

00:42:47.100 --> 00:42:52.900
Soon the kitchen warms and the
fresh scent of [NAVAJO] drifts

00:42:52.900 --> 00:42:54.800
through the house.

00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:58.430
The cats are now
sleeping circles of fur.

00:42:58.430 --> 00:43:00.380
The door opens.

00:43:00.380 --> 00:43:02.900
My husband comes in smiling.

00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:07.650
He's savoring [NAVAJO]
and melting butter.

00:43:07.650 --> 00:43:12.110
And then this is what the
word means-- [NAVAJO]-- here,

00:43:12.110 --> 00:43:14.310
as in [NAVAJO].

00:43:14.310 --> 00:43:16.070
That's what we say
to kids-- here,

00:43:16.070 --> 00:43:20.280
now go run along, go
play, after you give them

00:43:20.280 --> 00:43:23.530
a little piece of dough.

00:43:23.530 --> 00:43:25.542
[NAVAJO] for you.

00:43:25.542 --> 00:43:29.970
[NAVAJO] I made this for you.

00:43:29.970 --> 00:43:32.540
[NAVAJO]

00:43:32.540 --> 00:43:35.780
Here, I made this for you.

00:43:35.780 --> 00:43:41.760
[NAVAJO] I slapped this
dough into shape for you.

00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:48.636
[NAVAJO] This warm circle of
dough is spread out for you.

00:43:48.636 --> 00:43:54.743
[NAVAJO] There--
[NAVAJO] Is it good?

00:44:04.890 --> 00:44:06.700
I want to read this poem.

00:44:12.870 --> 00:44:18.780
I want to read a villanelle,
which is also fixed form.

00:44:18.780 --> 00:44:20.565
This is called
Near to the Water.

00:44:23.590 --> 00:44:26.820
And a villanelle is
a poem of 19 lines

00:44:26.820 --> 00:44:30.490
and it has a rhyme
scheme of ABA,

00:44:30.490 --> 00:44:33.450
and then it has a
quatrain at the end,

00:44:33.450 --> 00:44:35.150
and it has repeating lines.

00:44:43.770 --> 00:44:45.598
Near to the water means
near to the water.

00:44:49.750 --> 00:44:55.050
[NAVAJO] is the name
near to the water.

00:44:55.050 --> 00:44:57.890
[NAVAJO] is where
my father's from.

00:44:57.890 --> 00:45:03.755
[NAVAJO] is a variation
of my mother's name, which

00:45:03.755 --> 00:45:09.130
is [NAVAJO] And I wanted
to write this poem

00:45:09.130 --> 00:45:14.280
for my father, who in
his last years of life

00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:18.070
and last months
of life would not

00:45:18.070 --> 00:45:24.020
eat anything but blue corn,
things made of blue corn.

00:45:24.020 --> 00:45:30.600
And I wanted to honor that,
and to honor my father.

00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:33.800
I have to say that
Brianna doesn't really

00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:36.730
remember her
[NAVAJO], my father,

00:45:36.730 --> 00:45:39.626
but he was so close to her.

00:45:42.300 --> 00:45:46.240
He didn't really
speak English a lot,

00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:52.960
but he would talk to Navajo to
her, and she was about 3 or 4,

00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:55.880
and they could
understand each other.

00:45:55.880 --> 00:45:58.540
And when she came into the room
when he was in the hospital,

00:45:58.540 --> 00:46:01.200
he would put out
his hand for her,

00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:03.050
and they would just hold hands.

00:46:03.050 --> 00:46:07.990
We'd lift her up so
that she could see him.

00:46:07.990 --> 00:46:15.920
He just was so close off
his grandchildren to her.

00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:19.240
And she actually looks
kind of like my father.

00:46:19.240 --> 00:46:24.260
My father was
light-complected for a Navajo.

00:46:24.260 --> 00:46:27.130
Near to the water.

00:46:27.130 --> 00:46:32.670
Most afternoons [NAVAJO] when
the sky is a brilliant teal,

00:46:32.670 --> 00:46:36.120
[NAVAJO] is at the
sunlit stove tending

00:46:36.120 --> 00:46:38.980
the speckled enamel pot.

00:46:38.980 --> 00:46:41.580
[NAVAJO] is redolent
of simmering

00:46:41.580 --> 00:46:44.690
soup and blue cornmeal.

00:46:44.690 --> 00:46:49.220
As a child, [NAVAJO] learned
to blend the fine cornmeal

00:46:49.220 --> 00:46:52.420
in the still mountain mornings.

00:46:52.420 --> 00:46:55.680
The quiet cadence of
the stirring spoon

00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:59.370
brought forth her mother's
voice on those days

00:46:59.370 --> 00:47:02.940
when the sky was
a brilliant teal.

00:47:02.940 --> 00:47:09.320
Later when [NAVAJO] saw the
red sunset in [NAVAJO] hair,

00:47:09.320 --> 00:47:12.290
it instilled such
an ancient longing

00:47:12.290 --> 00:47:15.110
like the lilting,
grinding songs that

00:47:15.110 --> 00:47:21.190
wrought childhood repasts,
warm bread, simmering soup,

00:47:21.190 --> 00:47:23.950
and blue cornmeal.

00:47:23.950 --> 00:47:26.350
On cold, quiet
nights, the elders

00:47:26.350 --> 00:47:32.600
tell of how a woman's long
hair reveals enduring wisdom.

00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:37.300
They say change in a
woman's hair averted drought

00:47:37.300 --> 00:47:40.720
on a dusty, hot
afternoon centuries

00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:44.740
ago when the sky was
a brilliant teal.

00:47:44.740 --> 00:47:48.810
[NAVAJO] the glistening
of [NAVAJO] hair

00:47:48.810 --> 00:47:52.940
recall the low peel
of distant thunder,

00:47:52.940 --> 00:47:58.030
when thin corn stalks rippled
in dry fields and sought

00:47:58.030 --> 00:48:00.320
cool rain.

00:48:00.320 --> 00:48:03.310
Now her [NAVAJO] is
redolent of simmering

00:48:03.310 --> 00:48:06.430
soup and blue cornmeal.

00:48:06.430 --> 00:48:11.050
As [NAVAJO] stirs the enamel
pot in the low winter dusk,

00:48:11.050 --> 00:48:16.050
her songs yield memories of
[NAVAJO] his resonant voice

00:48:16.050 --> 00:48:18.200
and dark eyes.

00:48:18.200 --> 00:48:23.080
The decades have taught [NAVAJO]
that those long ago afternoons

00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:28.440
and skies of brilliant teal are
the quintessence of stories,

00:48:28.440 --> 00:48:30.630
simmering soup,
and blue cornmeal.

00:48:38.490 --> 00:48:41.740
So I want to read this poem.

00:48:41.740 --> 00:48:47.570
Maybe two more poems, and
then turn it over to Shelly.

00:48:47.570 --> 00:48:51.390
This is a poem call
Afternoon in [NAVAJO],

00:48:51.390 --> 00:48:57.570
and [NAVAJO] is the
Navajo name for Santa Fe.

00:48:57.570 --> 00:49:03.920
It means beads of clear,
cold-- a necklace made

00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:08.120
of beads of clear, cold water.

00:49:08.120 --> 00:49:11.930
The Santa Fe afternoon
is warm and bright.

00:49:11.930 --> 00:49:15.520
The dogs are delirious
to be outdoors.

00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:19.030
They prance about,
panting loudly.

00:49:19.030 --> 00:49:22.070
Simmer down, guys, I say.

00:49:22.070 --> 00:49:25.050
They don't have to
wear jackets today.

00:49:25.050 --> 00:49:29.930
Once my husband said they
were embarrassed for jackets.

00:49:29.930 --> 00:49:33.720
I never saw an
embarrassed dog, I said.

00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:34.620
He'd just smile.

00:49:37.400 --> 00:49:41.140
A few months ago on
another warm afternoon,

00:49:41.140 --> 00:49:44.200
my mother sat on the
comfortable old couch

00:49:44.200 --> 00:49:46.610
in front of the wood stove.

00:49:46.610 --> 00:49:49.500
The stove is in the
center of the house

00:49:49.500 --> 00:49:53.060
where it is dim and cool.

00:49:53.060 --> 00:49:56.780
After straightening the
kitchen, I sat beside her.

00:49:56.780 --> 00:50:01.360
[NAVAJO] I said
leaning against her.

00:50:01.360 --> 00:50:07.720
This means tell me stories,
or tell me what's going on.

00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:10.370
[NAVAJO] she said.

00:50:10.370 --> 00:50:11.980
That's all.

00:50:11.980 --> 00:50:14.430
We both laughed.

00:50:14.430 --> 00:50:18.880
I adjusted the pillow behind
her head as she leaned back.

00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:22.890
I slipped my hand into hers
and leaned against her.

00:50:22.890 --> 00:50:26.360
Her hands are warm and thin.

00:50:26.360 --> 00:50:30.860
Unlike mine, she has
slim, elegant fingers.

00:50:30.860 --> 00:50:34.730
She patted my hand
and we were silent.

00:50:34.730 --> 00:50:38.080
We were alone in
the quiet house.

00:50:38.080 --> 00:50:43.330
Across the road, a cow bellowed
and somewhere by the wash,

00:50:43.330 --> 00:50:46.210
dogs were barking playfully.

00:50:46.210 --> 00:50:50.130
One sounded like a puppy.

00:50:50.130 --> 00:50:55.070
Here in the living room we
rested, closing our eyes.

00:50:55.070 --> 00:51:00.730
She said, with her eyes
still closed, let's sing.

00:51:00.730 --> 00:51:04.670
So I started a song
and she joined in.

00:51:04.670 --> 00:51:08.720
I sang close to her
so she could hear.

00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:15.400
We sang several songs, then she
started one, and I was quiet.

00:51:15.400 --> 00:51:19.740
I don't know that one, I said
after she raised her head

00:51:19.740 --> 00:51:21.840
and looked at me.

00:51:21.840 --> 00:51:24.050
You do, she said.

00:51:24.050 --> 00:51:27.490
One time I heard you singing it.

00:51:27.490 --> 00:51:34.180
She kept on singing, and after a
while I got it and we finished.

00:51:34.180 --> 00:51:39.180
[NAVAJO] she said,
like she was tired.

00:51:39.180 --> 00:51:41.660
She fell asleep.

00:51:41.660 --> 00:51:46.190
I kept holding her hand
and leaning on her.

00:51:46.190 --> 00:51:50.210
I wanted to fall
asleep, but couldn't.

00:51:50.210 --> 00:51:54.680
It seemed like there
was too much going on,

00:51:54.680 --> 00:51:58.630
but it was just she
and I sitting together

00:51:58.630 --> 00:52:02.310
on a late summer afternoon.

00:52:02.310 --> 00:52:06.100
Her cat, Kitty Baa
jumped on the couch

00:52:06.100 --> 00:52:09.210
and stretched out beside us.

00:52:09.210 --> 00:52:14.520
Kitty Baa and Mom always
nap at the same time.

00:52:14.520 --> 00:52:18.720
Today in [NAVAJO], there's
snow on the highest peaks

00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:21.710
of the Sangre de
Cristos, the mountain

00:52:21.710 --> 00:52:24.480
of the blood of Christ.

00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:30.310
The bright snow is startling
against the deep blue sky.

00:52:30.310 --> 00:52:34.500
It's warm enough to
use a screen door.

00:52:34.500 --> 00:52:40.260
The afternoon sun slants into
the kitchen in thin lines.

00:52:40.260 --> 00:52:45.430
The dogs sleep on
warm tile squares.

00:52:45.430 --> 00:52:49.182
It's mid-afternoon
in [NAVAJO], where

00:52:49.182 --> 00:52:54.590
beads of clear, cold water
form an ancient necklace that

00:52:54.590 --> 00:52:56.785
encircle the Sangre de Cristos.

00:53:06.090 --> 00:53:09.750
And I'll end with this one.

00:53:09.750 --> 00:53:17.760
We must always remember the
worlds our ancestors traveled.

00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:22.510
Always wear the
songs they gave us.

00:53:22.510 --> 00:53:27.040
Remember, we are
made of prayers.

00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:33.530
Now we leave wrapped in old
blankets of love and wisdom.

00:53:33.530 --> 00:53:36.355
[NAVAJO] Thank you very much.

00:54:02.450 --> 00:54:05.070
[SPEAKING NAVAJO]

00:54:05.070 --> 00:54:07.470
-Thank you, Luci.

00:54:07.470 --> 00:54:13.290
I think some of us are
here far from home,

00:54:13.290 --> 00:54:17.080
and it's always comforting
to hear your stories.

00:54:17.080 --> 00:54:20.110
But to hear your voice, and
to have you here with us

00:54:20.110 --> 00:54:24.280
at Harvard on what feels like
a very gray day that some of us

00:54:24.280 --> 00:54:25.770
have a hard time
with when we come

00:54:25.770 --> 00:54:28.610
from the southwest
and the sunshine.

00:54:28.610 --> 00:54:31.400
But you were here yesterday, you
got to see the lovely weather

00:54:31.400 --> 00:54:34.490
that we can have here.

00:54:34.490 --> 00:54:36.950
I have a couple questions.

00:54:36.950 --> 00:54:40.070
And the first one--
a couple of years

00:54:40.070 --> 00:54:45.110
ago you were named the inaugural
Navajo Nation poet laureate,

00:54:45.110 --> 00:54:48.590
I'm sure to the delight of
probably every Navajo Nation

00:54:48.590 --> 00:54:49.460
member.

00:54:49.460 --> 00:54:51.610
That seemed the most fitting.

00:54:51.610 --> 00:54:55.010
You were the person that
should have been name for that.

00:54:55.010 --> 00:55:00.520
But tell me what do you think
the significance is of that?

00:55:00.520 --> 00:55:05.690
What does it mean for Navajo
Nation to have a poet laureate?

00:55:05.690 --> 00:55:09.160
-So most nations
have poet laureates,

00:55:09.160 --> 00:55:12.750
and the Navajo Nation
is the first indigenous

00:55:12.750 --> 00:55:17.820
nation in the country that
has named a poet laureate.

00:55:17.820 --> 00:55:23.400
So I think it very much speaks
to our sense of ourselves

00:55:23.400 --> 00:55:27.210
as a nation, and to our
sense of sovereignty.

00:55:27.210 --> 00:55:31.790
And then it also
really recognizes

00:55:31.790 --> 00:55:40.030
our legacy and our lives today
as a people who love language,

00:55:40.030 --> 00:55:45.750
who are wrought from language,
from stories and prayers

00:55:45.750 --> 00:55:47.360
and songs.

00:55:47.360 --> 00:55:53.660
As a Navajo person, to
be alive now and today--

00:55:53.660 --> 00:55:57.170
over the centuries that
was what sustained us,

00:55:57.170 --> 00:55:59.300
and that was what saved us.

00:55:59.300 --> 00:56:03.690
And that's what today still
gives us that essence.

00:56:03.690 --> 00:56:10.110
So it recognizes, I
think, that history

00:56:10.110 --> 00:56:13.780
that is a spoken
history and that

00:56:13.780 --> 00:56:16.510
is ingrained in our
memories, as well as

00:56:16.510 --> 00:56:24.010
recognizing what it means to be
a poet in contemporary society.

00:56:24.010 --> 00:56:26.510
-And I think it's
even more significant

00:56:26.510 --> 00:56:30.540
that our poet laureate, our
inaugural and our current poet

00:56:30.540 --> 00:56:35.640
laureate, are women who
we recognize and honor,

00:56:35.640 --> 00:56:40.100
and really put you on a
pedestal up there as a role

00:56:40.100 --> 00:56:43.230
model for not just younger
women, but for all of us

00:56:43.230 --> 00:56:45.580
and for the entire nation.

00:56:45.580 --> 00:56:51.010
So we had lunch with
students, and we

00:56:51.010 --> 00:56:53.640
learned that your
poetry and your work

00:56:53.640 --> 00:56:56.650
really has an
international reach,

00:56:56.650 --> 00:56:59.670
and that some
students have really

00:56:59.670 --> 00:57:03.010
related your work to their
own cultures and some

00:57:03.010 --> 00:57:06.290
of the stories in
their cultures.

00:57:06.290 --> 00:57:09.980
What would you like your
audience, whoever they are

00:57:09.980 --> 00:57:11.900
and wherever they
are in the world,

00:57:11.900 --> 00:57:14.305
to come away with when
they read your work?

00:57:18.150 --> 00:57:25.360
-I suppose that it would be an
understanding or appreciation

00:57:25.360 --> 00:57:30.750
of our land, and each
of us-- our place

00:57:30.750 --> 00:57:37.570
within the fabric of our
ancestors, the stories,

00:57:37.570 --> 00:57:42.220
and our identity and our
own distinct languages.

00:57:45.020 --> 00:57:49.270
And then to recognize
or acknowledge

00:57:49.270 --> 00:57:53.430
that we belong to a family.

00:57:53.430 --> 00:57:56.960
We belong to a
family-- a huge family

00:57:56.960 --> 00:57:58.680
that really love stories.

00:57:58.680 --> 00:58:02.830
I was talking about this today
and how when somebody says,

00:58:02.830 --> 00:58:04.340
guess what?

00:58:04.340 --> 00:58:07.840
And you know-- we
all like stories,

00:58:07.840 --> 00:58:12.340
so whatever it might be
to be in that circle.

00:58:12.340 --> 00:58:15.320
Because in Navajo, when
people share stories

00:58:15.320 --> 00:58:19.900
or when they talk
to you, that means

00:58:19.900 --> 00:58:26.100
that you're within the circle
of being appreciated and being

00:58:26.100 --> 00:58:32.370
loved and being honored,
and to be in that circle

00:58:32.370 --> 00:58:36.130
where you're being told stories
and everybody's laughing,

00:58:36.130 --> 00:58:43.600
sometimes crying, it means
that you all love each other.

00:58:43.600 --> 00:58:47.350
You're all appreciative
of each other's presence

00:58:47.350 --> 00:58:49.530
and each other's voices.

00:58:49.530 --> 00:58:56.730
So to be told stories is at once
to be shown that you're loved.

00:58:56.730 --> 00:58:59.650
-And I think we've all heard
stories where we walk away

00:58:59.650 --> 00:59:01.850
and say, oh, that was
a real good story.

00:59:01.850 --> 00:59:03.350
I have to retell that somewhere.

00:59:03.350 --> 00:59:05.060
-You just satisfied.

00:59:05.060 --> 00:59:05.800
-That's right.

00:59:05.800 --> 00:59:07.630
And you remember it
and you think about it.

00:59:07.630 --> 00:59:10.970
You laugh later,
chuckle to yourself.

00:59:10.970 --> 00:59:13.860
One of the things you talked
about today with students

00:59:13.860 --> 00:59:20.120
was your choice to go and teach
poetry and do poetry workshops

00:59:20.120 --> 00:59:22.950
with students, but
specifically to do it

00:59:22.950 --> 00:59:26.810
in a Navajo way, your
Navajo way of teaching.

00:59:26.810 --> 00:59:28.680
I wonder if you could
tell the audience here

00:59:28.680 --> 00:59:33.840
what do you mean by that, the
Navajo way of teaching poetry?

00:59:33.840 --> 00:59:40.020
So when I was in undergraduate
and graduate school

00:59:40.020 --> 00:59:42.340
as a creative
writing student, we

00:59:42.340 --> 00:59:43.620
had a lot of poetry workshops.

00:59:49.660 --> 00:59:52.840
The requirement is that you
write a poem every week or so,

00:59:52.840 --> 00:59:54.430
an original poem.

00:59:54.430 --> 00:59:57.120
Then you read it to the
class, everyone reads it,

00:59:57.120 --> 00:59:58.980
and then they comment on it.

00:59:58.980 --> 01:00:03.460
So it's called critiquing
or analyzing your poem.

01:00:03.460 --> 01:00:05.490
And I have been
in many workshops

01:00:05.490 --> 01:00:10.070
where when a person's
poem came up,

01:00:10.070 --> 01:00:13.130
many times students
and even the professors

01:00:13.130 --> 01:00:16.910
would just be really critical.

01:00:16.910 --> 01:00:20.130
And students would run
from the room in tears,

01:00:20.130 --> 01:00:25.900
and drop their majors, and
it was just so devastating.

01:00:25.900 --> 01:00:32.590
It really hurt me to
see that, and I just

01:00:32.590 --> 01:00:35.500
knew that if I was
teaching poetry,

01:00:35.500 --> 01:00:40.030
if that was my classroom,
that wouldn't happen.

01:00:40.030 --> 01:00:43.750
It was so unnecessary to
me because it didn't only

01:00:43.750 --> 01:00:47.930
hurt whoever wrote that poem,
it hurt the whole class.

01:00:47.930 --> 01:00:50.280
We just sat there in
silence not knowing

01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:57.020
what to say after the professor
would just tear into a student.

01:00:57.020 --> 01:01:03.540
So when I then began to teach,
I very much established the fact

01:01:03.540 --> 01:01:05.710
that I'm Navajo.

01:01:12.335 --> 01:01:16.550
One of the things that I'll tell
is a story of the first laugh.

01:01:16.550 --> 01:01:20.070
When a baby first
laughs in Navajo,

01:01:20.070 --> 01:01:22.790
when they first
laugh in recognition

01:01:22.790 --> 01:01:31.850
to somebody's smile, or
they respond to a person--

01:01:31.850 --> 01:01:35.590
and it doesn't count when
they laugh in their sleep.

01:01:35.590 --> 01:01:39.180
But when they recognize
another human being

01:01:39.180 --> 01:01:41.990
and they make that
connection-- when a baby first

01:01:41.990 --> 01:01:45.400
laughs out loud, it's
such a celebration

01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:47.650
because it means the
baby has moved out

01:01:47.650 --> 01:01:49.970
of the world of the
holy people, where

01:01:49.970 --> 01:01:53.103
babies exist before they're
born and after they are born.

01:01:56.240 --> 01:01:58.230
They live in our
world but they really

01:01:58.230 --> 01:02:00.570
have a consciousness
of the holy people.

01:02:00.570 --> 01:02:04.010
When they laugh, they move,
they become part of us

01:02:04.010 --> 01:02:07.430
as a people that
live on this Earth.

01:02:07.430 --> 01:02:09.920
They become part of
the human family,

01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:12.600
so we celebrate
that because that

01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:17.410
was what was first done
for Changing Woman, who's

01:02:17.410 --> 01:02:20.400
our principal deity.

01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:24.010
So when she first laughed,
I had a big party for her

01:02:24.010 --> 01:02:29.190
because it was an
utterance of her breath.

01:02:29.190 --> 01:02:34.720
And they celebrated
it, and we celebrate it

01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:38.470
because we want the
baby to always be happy.

01:02:38.470 --> 01:02:40.260
And then we have a big dinner.

01:02:40.260 --> 01:02:45.620
Whoever makes the baby
laugh funds the dinner.

01:02:45.620 --> 01:02:47.780
So I always tell my
students if you're

01:02:47.780 --> 01:02:50.860
waiting for a
financial aid check,

01:02:50.860 --> 01:02:54.070
don't go making babies laugh.

01:02:54.070 --> 01:02:56.530
You have to be
able to afford it.

01:02:56.530 --> 01:02:59.900
So you're responsible
for the whole dinner,

01:02:59.900 --> 01:03:02.260
and people do it very happily.

01:03:02.260 --> 01:03:05.110
And then during this dinner,
during this celebration,

01:03:05.110 --> 01:03:08.310
during the ceremony,
the baby assumes

01:03:08.310 --> 01:03:14.560
the role of Changing Woman, boy
or girl, and everybody lines

01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:15.060
up.

01:03:15.060 --> 01:03:20.080
Since you're in the presence
of a holy person and a deity,

01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:24.500
you line up and then you
can ask the baby-- whisper

01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:29.990
to the baby, who's now Changing
Woman-- any wish that you want.

01:03:29.990 --> 01:03:32.230
Anything that you want.

01:03:32.230 --> 01:03:35.870
So that's one reason people
like to go to these dinners,

01:03:35.870 --> 01:03:40.910
these ceremonies, because you
get to meet a holy person.

01:03:40.910 --> 01:03:44.780
But the thing is that when
you ask for what you want,

01:03:44.780 --> 01:03:47.520
since it's all in humor
and celebrating humor,

01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:50.820
you ask backwards.

01:03:50.820 --> 01:03:56.920
So like a little boy may say,
may I marry a real ugly woman?

01:03:56.920 --> 01:03:59.770
But they mean the
opposite of that.

01:03:59.770 --> 01:04:02.590
And so they're really
funny because everybody's

01:04:02.590 --> 01:04:04.600
asking for things opposite.

01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:07.800
The baby gives out gifts.

01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:12.300
The baby puts corn pollen
or salt in everybody's palm

01:04:12.300 --> 01:04:14.510
as they whisper wishes to her.

01:04:14.510 --> 01:04:22.910
And the baby also has a big
pile of fruit, gifts, toys,

01:04:22.910 --> 01:04:26.380
all kinds of little stuff, so
they give each person a gift.

01:04:26.380 --> 01:04:29.240
So the holy person not
only hears your wish,

01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:32.170
but you get a gift
from the holy person.

01:04:32.170 --> 01:04:36.460
And there's a lot
of people there

01:04:36.460 --> 01:04:39.120
because we don't
want the baby to ever

01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:44.260
be lonely, to be anywhere
without relatives.

01:04:44.260 --> 01:04:47.620
And we don't want the baby
to just be wandering around

01:04:47.620 --> 01:04:48.560
by themselves.

01:04:48.560 --> 01:04:52.590
We always want them to know
that this is their home.

01:04:52.590 --> 01:04:57.480
And then also for the baby not
to be stingy, not to be saying,

01:04:57.480 --> 01:04:58.340
that's mine.

01:04:58.340 --> 01:04:59.740
Leave that alone.

01:04:59.740 --> 01:05:03.340
To always be generous and
to share what they have.

01:05:03.340 --> 01:05:06.374
So that has to do
with the breath.

01:05:06.374 --> 01:05:09.310
So in Navajo, they
say the sacred

01:05:09.310 --> 01:05:12.060
begins at the tip of my tongue.

01:05:12.060 --> 01:05:16.170
So when you can feel your
breath when you're talking,

01:05:16.170 --> 01:05:19.700
you're putting the sacred
out into the world.

01:05:19.700 --> 01:05:24.140
And the sacred is when you
take your first breath.

01:05:24.140 --> 01:05:27.920
It enters through all your
fingertips and the whirl

01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:29.880
on top of your head.

01:05:29.880 --> 01:05:32.120
So they always say
your fingertips

01:05:32.120 --> 01:05:33.290
aren't just for the FBI.

01:05:37.132 --> 01:05:41.020
All the different kinds of
wind enter your fingertips

01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:44.880
when you take your first
breath after you're born.

01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:48.030
And I don't know if
they still slap a baby,

01:05:48.030 --> 01:05:51.210
but the first breath
in this world.

01:05:51.210 --> 01:05:55.430
So you're imbued with
those sacred winds.

01:05:55.430 --> 01:05:58.300
Every time you speak
or express yourself,

01:05:58.300 --> 01:06:00.000
you're expressing the sacred.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:03.430
So that's what I talk about
in my creative writing class,

01:06:03.430 --> 01:06:05.790
is that every poem
that they created

01:06:05.790 --> 01:06:08.450
has never existed before.

01:06:08.450 --> 01:06:11.960
It now exists and they
put it into the world.

01:06:11.960 --> 01:06:15.350
Therefore, we have
to honor that,

01:06:15.350 --> 01:06:19.300
and so we're there to say what
you really like about the poem,

01:06:19.300 --> 01:06:21.690
and then to make
suggestions to make

01:06:21.690 --> 01:06:24.070
it tighter and more refined.

01:06:24.070 --> 01:06:31.900
But that defeats the
whole premise of creation.

01:06:31.900 --> 01:06:35.495
You can't be creative
if you're afraid of what

01:06:35.495 --> 01:06:38.280
people are going to say.

01:06:38.280 --> 01:06:43.080
-And I think that's good
to tell not just students,

01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:46.250
but individuals
that when you write,

01:06:46.250 --> 01:06:49.210
not to be afraid of
how it's going to sound

01:06:49.210 --> 01:06:52.000
or what's going to
be put out there.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:55.650
And back to the first
laugh, it's always difficult

01:06:55.650 --> 01:06:57.510
when a baby's 2 to 3 months.

01:06:57.510 --> 01:07:00.290
The first question when you
see the baby to the parents

01:07:00.290 --> 01:07:02.030
is, has the baby laughed?

01:07:02.030 --> 01:07:04.920
And if it's a no, you walk away.

01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:07.006
I don't want to be
around the baby.

01:07:07.006 --> 01:07:09.380
And then there are parents
who invite certain people over

01:07:09.380 --> 01:07:11.064
during that stage
because they really

01:07:11.064 --> 01:07:12.480
hope that they'll
talk to the baby

01:07:12.480 --> 01:07:16.400
and make the baby laugh because
they can throw a good party.

01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:18.190
-A really good party.

01:07:18.190 --> 01:07:19.850
-So I feel bad
for baby sometimes

01:07:19.850 --> 01:07:20.906
between 2 or 3 months.

01:07:20.906 --> 01:07:22.530
You don't know if
people are around you

01:07:22.530 --> 01:07:25.440
who want to be around you,
or they're purposely trying

01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:27.566
to be there for a reason.

01:07:27.566 --> 01:07:28.940
We have a couple
of minutes, so I

01:07:28.940 --> 01:07:32.530
don't know if there was a
question from the audience.

01:07:32.530 --> 01:07:33.530
Yeah.

01:07:33.530 --> 01:07:38.402
-I have heard that puns
are a really important part

01:07:38.402 --> 01:07:41.120
of Navajo language,
punning and humor,

01:07:41.120 --> 01:07:44.880
and I wonder if that plays a
role in your poetry at all.

01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:46.417
-Give me an example of a pun.

01:07:51.387 --> 01:07:53.771
-When is a door not a door?

01:07:53.771 --> 01:07:54.270
-What?

01:07:54.270 --> 01:07:57.002
-When is a door not a door?

01:07:57.002 --> 01:07:59.302
When it's ajar.

01:07:59.302 --> 01:08:02.020
-Oh, I see.

01:08:02.020 --> 01:08:04.708
I thought you meant
adore, like, I adore you.

01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:09.090
I'm sure there are.

01:08:09.090 --> 01:08:13.170
I'm trying to think
of-- it depends

01:08:13.170 --> 01:08:15.750
on how you say certain things.

01:08:15.750 --> 01:08:18.279
So for instance-- well,
it's not really a pun,

01:08:18.279 --> 01:08:22.819
but it sort of shows you the
creativity of Navajo language.

01:08:22.819 --> 01:08:25.080
I was reading the poem
about [NAVAJO], which

01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:29.420
means a little bitty dog,
like a chihuahua-- there's

01:08:29.420 --> 01:08:33.479
a whole story behind
that, about [NAVAJO], how

01:08:33.479 --> 01:08:35.189
they saved a little boy.

01:08:35.189 --> 01:08:37.700
So we don't normally
let dogs in our house,

01:08:37.700 --> 01:08:40.760
but we let the little bitty
ones in because they once

01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:43.790
saved a little boy,
and so we really

01:08:43.790 --> 01:08:45.700
revere those little dogs.

01:08:45.700 --> 01:08:49.930
Anyway, in that poem I talked
about the names of dogs.

01:08:49.930 --> 01:08:52.805
There was Lobo,
Snazzy and Tlog'i.

01:08:52.805 --> 01:09:01.470
And Tlog'i actually means,
like-- [NAVAJO] means grass.

01:09:01.470 --> 01:09:07.200
But when you say
Tlog'i, it means furry.

01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:12.529
So there's different meanings
depending on how you say it.

01:09:12.529 --> 01:09:14.050
I'm sure there's other examples.

01:09:14.050 --> 01:09:19.899
It's a really precise
language, so without knowing,

01:09:19.899 --> 01:09:23.770
sometimes you can say the wrong
thing that you didn't mean just

01:09:23.770 --> 01:09:25.560
because of a syllable.

01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:28.229
And I'm sure that there's
puns, but somehow I

01:09:28.229 --> 01:09:31.665
can't think of-- if you
said that in Navajo, I

01:09:31.665 --> 01:09:35.020
could probably think of it.

01:09:35.020 --> 01:09:37.640
But puns--

01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:39.844
-Oral history is,
itself, very beautiful,

01:09:39.844 --> 01:09:42.520
and some would
argue it's poetic.

01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:46.260
If you think back to the
history of Navajo language

01:09:46.260 --> 01:09:51.029
and the relationship to
poetry, where are the origins

01:09:51.029 --> 01:09:53.427
and where are the boundaries
between the beauty

01:09:53.427 --> 01:10:00.180
of oral history and the
specificity of Navajo poetry?

01:10:00.180 --> 01:10:02.103
-I can only speak
to Navajo poetry.

01:10:05.230 --> 01:10:06.940
You mean Navajo oral history?

01:10:06.940 --> 01:10:09.110
I think they're so interwoven.

01:10:09.110 --> 01:10:12.620
It's so replete
with various kinds

01:10:12.620 --> 01:10:19.640
of really precise, intricate
verbal expressions,

01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:25.340
and there's not really a
word in Navajo for poetry.

01:10:25.340 --> 01:10:33.430
You can say [NAVAJO]
which means language,

01:10:33.430 --> 01:10:37.140
it means what a person
says, but it also

01:10:37.140 --> 01:10:43.420
encompasses stories,
knowledge, wisdom, songs.

01:10:43.420 --> 01:10:47.620
It compasses a whole
variety of knowledge,

01:10:47.620 --> 01:10:50.470
and it means that a person
knows their history,

01:10:50.470 --> 01:10:55.180
they know their
origin, they understand

01:10:55.180 --> 01:10:58.990
the meaning of the mountains
and the different directions,

01:10:58.990 --> 01:11:01.490
different stones,
where the origin is.

01:11:01.490 --> 01:11:04.140
You know the origin
of your clothes.

01:11:04.140 --> 01:11:07.440
So there's a word
for that-- [NAVAJO]

01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:10.210
and it just has a
very general meaning,

01:11:10.210 --> 01:11:13.960
and that's where poetry
exists, as well, is stories.

01:11:13.960 --> 01:11:17.640
But it doesn't exist as it
does in English by itself.

01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:24.420
It's embodied in
all this knowledge.

01:11:24.420 --> 01:11:24.920
-Thank you.

01:11:24.920 --> 01:11:25.990
That was a good question.

01:11:25.990 --> 01:11:28.451
We have one more and
then we'll be done.

01:11:28.451 --> 01:11:30.599
-So I wondered if you
could talk about when

01:11:30.599 --> 01:11:34.012
you decide to translate
Navajo in your poems

01:11:34.012 --> 01:11:35.440
and when you decide not to.

01:11:40.260 --> 01:11:42.240
-I don't know.

01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:44.130
It just kind of happens.

01:11:44.130 --> 01:11:45.140
I really don't.

01:11:45.140 --> 01:11:47.650
It's not really conscious.

01:11:47.650 --> 01:11:49.715
I know that when I'm
writing a sestina,

01:11:49.715 --> 01:11:54.530
I'll already have
the words in mind.

01:11:54.530 --> 01:11:59.180
So some words have so many
different varied meanings

01:11:59.180 --> 01:12:03.510
that it's easier to do things
in Navajo, use Navajo words,

01:12:03.510 --> 01:12:05.900
than it is in English.

01:12:05.900 --> 01:12:13.080
But as a poet and as a
writer, I write all the time,

01:12:13.080 --> 01:12:19.000
and it's really what the story
or the poem or the vignette

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:19.980
wants to be.

01:12:23.460 --> 01:12:26.570
So I'm the person
that writes it down.

01:12:32.350 --> 01:12:36.760
I write it down, but
I don't invent it.

01:12:36.760 --> 01:12:39.580
-It just sort of fits, right?

01:12:39.580 --> 01:12:41.020
Well, thank you again, Luci.

01:12:41.020 --> 01:12:45.490
From Radcliffe and HUNAP we have
a very nice HUNAP coffee mug

01:12:45.490 --> 01:12:46.690
for you for your Hills Bros.

01:12:46.690 --> 01:12:47.190
Coffee.

01:12:47.190 --> 01:12:49.090
-Oh, thank you.

01:12:49.090 --> 01:12:50.590
-Or your Starbucks.

01:12:50.590 --> 01:12:52.440
-Thank you.
