00:00:01.089 --> 00:00:06.210
In the outskirts of our solar system, billions
of kilometers past Pluto, there might be a

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.120
mysterious planet lurking in the abyss.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:15.480
The hypothetical body is known as Planet X
or Planet Nine, and some astronomers have

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.120
been trying to prove its existence for a good
chunk of the last decade.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.800
It’s believed that the phantom planet has
a mass about 10 times that of Earth making

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.850
it close in size to our ice giants.

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:32.390
Like many other celestial objects, Planet
Nine is thought to orbit the Sun except it

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:38.050
takes a much longer elliptical route, traveling
an estimated 20 times farther from the Sun

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.570
on average than Neptune.

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:47.030
NASA says at that distance, it may take between
10,000 and 20,000 Earth years to make one

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.940
full orbit around the sun.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.260
Planet Nine is too far to be observed with
a modern telescope, but a planet as big as

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.700
it’s believed to be should leave a trace
of its presence in the gravity it exerts on other objects.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:06.990
And that thought process is based off of Sir
Isaac Newton’s law of universal gravitation,

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:13.100
which established that the gravitational force
between two bodies is proportional to their masses.

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.600
This formula essentially shows that an object
with a larger mass will have an effect on an

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.389
object with a smaller mass.

00:01:19.389 --> 00:01:21.800
Take Jupiter, for example.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:27.160
The gas giant is so large, its gravitational
pull impacts the smaller celestial bodies

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.700
around it, trapping them in its orbit and
altering their trajectories.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:37.340
Jupiter’s pull is even thought to be the reason
why Mars’s orbit is slightly elliptical.

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.640
Planet Nine believers are pointing to Newton’s
law of universal gravitation as a basis for its existence.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:49.000
Due to the discovery of several distant
objects that are behaving in an unusual way.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.800
The objects in question are located in the
inner Oort Cloud, a mysterious region that

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.960
surrounds the solar system like a bubble.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.960
The group has complimentary orbit patterns
that swing far out in the same general direction

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.920
and then cluster as they round the Sun.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.460
It’s believed these similarities are a result of Planet Nine’s

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:15.660
gravitational pull, and a recently discovered
dwarf planet is giving more weight to this scenario.

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.950
The pint-sized planet, nicknamed
The Goblin, travels about 2,300 astronomical

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:26.580
units away from the Sun at its most distant
point and 65 AU at its closest.

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.300
To put that into perspective.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:35.020
One AU is equal to the average Earth-Sun distance
which is about 150 million kilometers.

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.780
So there are still 9.6 billion kilometers
between The Goblin and the Sun

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.220
at their closest point.

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:47.120
Because of this extreme distance, the gravity
of the known planets in the outer solar system

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.160
are unlikely the cause of The Goblin’s unusual behavior.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:56.060
So, there has to be something else perturbing
these distant celestial bodies, right?

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.800
Well, while there are a few astronomers that
are 90 percent sure Planet 9 is the culprit

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.580
others aren’t so sold on its existence.

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.540
Some non-believers do think that something is affecting
the objects,

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.739
but say an undiscovered planet probably isn’t the cause.

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:19.219
For now, the sample size of these distant objects is just too small to draw any conclusions.

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:24.370
But NASA says the Oort Cloud may contain more
than a trillion icy bodies, so it’s likely

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:29.080
that new discoveries could increase the possibility of a potential phantom planet.

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.480
And that's exactly the hope of the Planet Nine hunters.

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.080
So they'll continue to search for more dwarf planets

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:40.560
like The Goblin in their quest for the ultimate
astronomical achievement.
