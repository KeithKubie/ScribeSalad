1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:05,330
[inaudible] joining me today as a
professor of economics at George Mason

2
00:00:07,561 --> 00:00:08,281
University,

3
00:00:08,281 --> 00:00:13,260
the host of conversations with Tyler
podcast and the author of stubborn

4
00:00:13,261 --> 00:00:17,100
attachments, a vision for a
society of free, prosperous,

5
00:00:17,101 --> 00:00:21,540
and responsible individuals. Tyler Cowen,
welcome to the Rubin report. My pleasure.

6
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:26,340
Now I did your podcast once and I believe
that the first question you asked me

7
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:31,320
was do I like being on the interviewing
side or in the interview side?

8
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:34,260
So I'm going to start with
the same exact question.

9
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:39,090
I spent the first half of my life being
interviewed the last fifth of my life

10
00:00:39,091 --> 00:00:43,770
being the interviewer for 58 segments
and now I'm being interviewed. So for me,

11
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,870
so we've come full circle and then
around halfway around again are saying

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,720
there's less preparation when you're
being interviewed. So that's easier. Yeah.

13
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:53,400
All right, so I'm, I'm
thrilled that you're here.

14
00:00:53,401 --> 00:00:57,730
I wanted to have you on for for
quite some time. You are sort of for,

15
00:00:57,731 --> 00:01:01,830
for so many of the people that have
influenced me, you have influenced them.

16
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:02,761
So I think there's a,

17
00:01:02,761 --> 00:01:05,530
there's a certain beauty of this and
we're going to do a lot on economics and,

18
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,290
and,
and all sorts of stuff here,

19
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,650
but I always like to start with
sort of little bit of background,

20
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,860
just sort of where you're from and
history before we get into the meat.

21
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,700
So tell me a little bit about Tyler Cowen.
I was born in northern New Jersey.

22
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:22,110
I was a nerd growing up. I played chess.
It was that an economics and philosophy.

23
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:24,750
Now I teach at George
Mason and live in Virginia.

24
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:30,000
Travel a lot and I'm a kind of
information omnivore. Yeah, and you're a,

25
00:01:30,001 --> 00:01:31,180
you're a big basketball fan.

26
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:34,920
We just did a whole basketball NBA fan
sprays a big difference. Yeah. So me too,

27
00:01:34,921 --> 00:01:37,350
I'm not a huge college fan nor mine.
It's not good enough.

28
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:41,700
And so why not watch the best,
right? There's enough of the NBA,

29
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,800
especially with the Internet and Youtube,

30
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,610
and it's a way of thinking about
talent evaluation, rules of the game,

31
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:50,250
technical innovations,
conceptual breakthroughs,

32
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:54,450
how to get a group of people to cooperate.
It's a kind of economics in a way.

33
00:01:54,451 --> 00:01:56,010
It's like a new laboratory.
Yeah.

34
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,550
So when did you get interested
in economics and economics?

35
00:01:59,551 --> 00:02:03,630
I was 13 and my father brought home
like some magazines and periodicals.

36
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:08,820
I started reading them. I then went to
the public library. Never stopped. Yeah.

37
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:10,880
Yeah. You went to the
library, never said, and were,

38
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:14,130
were you always interested in sort of
more libertarian leaning economics or do

39
00:02:14,131 --> 00:02:17,220
you read everything and then kind
of figure out where you fell or,

40
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,990
I read everything but early on I read
Hayak I read Milton Friedman, uh,

41
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:25,640
some of Vine Rand Henry Hazlitt. That
made a big impression on me. And uh,

42
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,930
I was, you know, then 13, 14. Yeah.

43
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:31,310
Was that a weird thing for a 13 or 14
year old to be into? Or I guess you said,

44
00:02:31,311 --> 00:02:33,240
I think it was, and this
was pre internet, right?

45
00:02:33,241 --> 00:02:37,110
So people were not exposed and I just
went crazy and I read all of Plato's

46
00:02:37,111 --> 00:02:40,350
dialogues and I just thought, I'm going
to do this for the rest of my life.

47
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:44,970
How can I find a way of always being,
reading, writing, talking to people? Yeah.

48
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:48,750
What do you like more doing the
academic side of things? Teaching?

49
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:51,360
Or do you like podcasting?
More public speaking?

50
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:55,020
I don't think they're so different.
Podcasting is the new education, right?

51
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,680
So think of it as an educational
innovation and you reach people.

52
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,400
The discussions are often smarter
than in the classic classroom.

53
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:07,480
So I view it as one in the same really
kind of integration. Yeah. So, okay.

54
00:03:07,481 --> 00:03:12,220
So let's just talk about your economic
beliefs in general. So basically,

55
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:15,340
basically you're a libertarian,
right? Is that smaller libertarian?

56
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,770
So what does that mean? Cause
people say that all the time. Let's,

57
00:03:17,771 --> 00:03:21,880
I like defining terms specifically when
you say you're a small l libertarian,

58
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:24,880
I believe in freer markets,
social liberalism,

59
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:29,110
and I'm often skeptical of
foreign policy abroad. That said,

60
00:03:29,111 --> 00:03:32,590
some libertarian simply refuse to admit
that government can never do good.

61
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,240
I don't think that's the case.

62
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:38,230
Antismoking campaign would be one good
example of something that did people a

63
00:03:38,231 --> 00:03:41,890
lot of good. It was led by
government. So empirics come first,

64
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:44,530
look at the evidence.
But I think overall right now,

65
00:03:44,531 --> 00:03:48,760
people in our society under a business
and over eight the government. Yeah.

66
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:50,500
So is there any difference,

67
00:03:50,501 --> 00:03:53,890
any meaningful difference between a small
l libertarian in a classical liberal,

68
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:57,940
when people say classical liberal,
I think it confuses the listener.

69
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:00,820
Does the word liberal in there?
What does classical mean?

70
00:04:00,821 --> 00:04:04,300
That reminds people of the 19th century.
I don't like any of these words.

71
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:07,210
I feel I've written and
done so much online.

72
00:04:07,211 --> 00:04:09,640
People can use search and see
what I think on any issue,

73
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,680
but I'll still go with
small and a libertarian.

74
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,450
I won't deny I'm a classical liberal,

75
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:17,500
so I should probably be saying small
little libertarian by, by your definition.

76
00:04:17,501 --> 00:04:20,920
I agree. It's gotten confusing. I'm
trying to clean up the word liberal so,

77
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:25,330
so deeply that it becomes hard to do
that because people have suggested

78
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:26,650
associations with the word.

79
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:30,370
If I could just call myself liberal
as you can in some European countries,

80
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,610
that would be my preferred approach.
But here it just won't work. Right.

81
00:04:33,611 --> 00:04:36,400
That's the problem. Yeah. Well this
is listened to all over the world.

82
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:40,570
So in England, I'm a liberal. You're a
liberal know liberal that that's nice.

83
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:42,190
So light touch a government,

84
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,600
how do you figure out where the right
spot for government to do some things?

85
00:04:46,601 --> 00:04:49,720
It's cause I'm sure there's libertarians
that may be our big l libertarians that

86
00:04:49,721 --> 00:04:52,270
are going all right,
well even if the antismoking thing worked,

87
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:55,330
it's not the purview of
government to do such things.

88
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:58,440
I believe in the power of economic growth.
Uh,

89
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:02,590
the significance of just compounding
returns over time and the economy that

90
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:05,050
grows at 3% over time becomes much,

91
00:05:05,051 --> 00:05:09,490
much wealthier than an economy
growing at 2%. So we need to ask like,

92
00:05:09,491 --> 00:05:12,070
what are genuine public goods
the government should provide?

93
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:17,490
I think support for basic science or
basic social welfare state or safety net,

94
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:22,210
obviously foreign policy than there are
particular instances where governments

95
00:05:22,211 --> 00:05:25,990
have done good. Uh, but the presumption
should be in favor of liberty.

96
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:29,830
People do have individual rights. You
just can't take all their money from them.

97
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:34,540
We way overregulate most of our economy.
We could be far more dynamic.

98
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:38,920
We've had wage stagnation in this
country for decades and we are complacent

99
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:42,190
about all that. I mean that, that's
my basic take on America today. Yeah.

100
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:45,340
And I think, you know, I'm, I'm
pretty much on board of all that.

101
00:05:45,341 --> 00:05:49,960
Are you shocked at the
amount of individual liberty
that people sort of want to

102
00:05:49,961 --> 00:05:51,640
outsource to the government?
As you said, they,

103
00:05:51,641 --> 00:05:56,260
they want to trust government more than,
than markets. Right now on social issues,

104
00:05:56,261 --> 00:05:58,010
I'm fairly hardened.

105
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:01,360
I don't think people should ever
go to jail for smoking pot say,

106
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:05,990
and we're moving in that direction. I
never expected that say 15 years ago, uh,

107
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,020
gay rights, gay marriage. Again, it wasn't
clear or a while ago that would happen.

108
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:12,290
And that's great. Yeah. In those areas,

109
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:15,290
people have been very protective
and fought hard for good changes.

110
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,030
But when it comes to economics,

111
00:06:17,031 --> 00:06:22,031
I see too much resentment and too much
shrillness and just to believe that most

112
00:06:22,461 --> 00:06:25,730
say billionaires out there and
somehow didn't earn their wealth.

113
00:06:25,731 --> 00:06:28,940
And it's our job to take it from that,
which is becoming a huge theme right now.

114
00:06:28,941 --> 00:06:31,250
Right. I mean, Elizabeth
Warren, just in the last week,

115
00:06:31,251 --> 00:06:34,040
she wants a billionaire's
tax and she's upset that,

116
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:37,750
who's the guy that got the yacht?
Uh Oh, I forget. Yeah. You know,

117
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:40,460
he got a yacht and then she doesn't seem
to understand that a lot of people were

118
00:06:40,461 --> 00:06:43,910
employed to build that yacht at all
the resources that went into that yet.

119
00:06:43,911 --> 00:06:46,160
But she thinks she has a moral right,

120
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,800
that that seems to be coming out
to the left a lot these days.

121
00:06:48,801 --> 00:06:49,910
Cortez is doing this,

122
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:54,500
that there's a moral right to take
people's money who have too much.

123
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:57,560
I think a lot of it is just
competition for the voters.

124
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:00,740
So everyone wants either the
nomination and more publicity,

125
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:04,220
so they put forward crazy ideas
to get traction on social media.

126
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:06,650
The net result is to help Donald Trump,
actually,

127
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:08,900
I call it the Donald
Trump reelection campaign.

128
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:11,330
The more Democrats talk about taxes,

129
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,330
it's ultimately a winning
issue for Republicans.

130
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:17,630
No matter what the Democrats say, voters
will never trust them more on taxes.

131
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:20,870
It's like healthcare. No matter what
your view is, when that's the topic,

132
00:07:20,871 --> 00:07:23,030
Democrats are more popular in taxes.
A trip.

133
00:07:23,031 --> 00:07:25,970
Publicans so it's this weird paradox,

134
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:29,390
democrats pursuing their own individual
interests and hurting their party.

135
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:31,460
Do you think that the,

136
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:35,060
like when Elizabeth Warren or one of
these people that always want to tax more

137
00:07:35,061 --> 00:07:35,894
and more and more,

138
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:40,190
do you think they actually believe
it's the right thing to do or that they

139
00:07:40,191 --> 00:07:42,800
believe it's cold,
calculated political move,

140
00:07:42,801 --> 00:07:45,590
even though your argument is that
it doesn't make sense politically?

141
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:49,160
Like I don't imagine them doing things
that are against what they believe will

142
00:07:49,161 --> 00:07:52,340
work politically. I think you're
probably right that it doesn't work,

143
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:55,280
but it's hard to know if they,
they know that it doesn't work.

144
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:58,400
It's a cold calculating political move.
In my view.

145
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:01,070
They don't quite think it's a disaster.

146
00:08:01,071 --> 00:08:05,060
They just think we need to move the
debate in this direction about taxing rich

147
00:08:05,061 --> 00:08:08,630
people more talking about this
for them will work in that way.

148
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:13,990
So they have a broader notion of work
than what an academic might have and more

149
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:17,240
or less coincides with
making a stink about it. Now,

150
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,900
does he drive you crazy when
politicians talk about economics? No,

151
00:08:20,901 --> 00:08:24,890
I mean newer to that, uh, I think I'm
fairly detached as a personality type.

152
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,250
I don't like it, but at the end
of the day, if it drove me crazy,

153
00:08:28,251 --> 00:08:30,680
I would be less effective
communicating myself.

154
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:35,900
So who would you say in the political
sentence is talking about economics in a

155
00:08:35,901 --> 00:08:40,160
way that is roughly within a framework
that you like? Is there anybody?

156
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:45,610
It's hard to think. So I'm pro
immigration, but with limits, uh,

157
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:50,340
that's a pretty centrist position. But the
center is pretty empty right now. Okay.

158
00:08:50,341 --> 00:08:51,021
But I'll,
I'll go,

159
00:08:51,021 --> 00:08:54,170
let's lay it out for me and I'll see
if we can figure out somebody here.

160
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:58,620
The liberal have an earlier time perhaps.
So private immigration,

161
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:00,030
definitely pro free trade,

162
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:03,990
which is running against a lot
of the Republicans right now. Uh,

163
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,220
other than say climate change issues.
I would deregulate most of our economy.

164
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:13,120
I would have much more freedom to build
in San Francisco or Manhattan. Uh,

165
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:17,490
I would have radical reforms to k through
12 education with much greater choice,

166
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:19,620
just a lot more experimentation.

167
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:25,100
I would never send people to jail for
doing drugs unless they're selling drugs

168
00:09:25,321 --> 00:09:28,740
to minors. Uh, I'm not sure are all
drugs should be totally illegal,

169
00:09:28,741 --> 00:09:31,830
but just kind of in a safe
space off to the side.

170
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,840
And I would welcome a not so polarized
America where there's tolerance and a

171
00:09:36,841 --> 00:09:40,850
very strong center and some real belief
about the importance of America's role

172
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:44,310
in the world, but more about building
alliances than being aggressive.

173
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:47,940
That means that those are
my views. Yeah. I mean, I,

174
00:09:47,941 --> 00:09:50,040
I'm there I'd everything you just said.
Yeah.

175
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:52,680
And I do think that empty
center that you just referenced,

176
00:09:52,681 --> 00:09:56,790
these actually starting to get filled up
with people that have had it with both

177
00:09:56,791 --> 00:10:00,690
sides, which is I guess, heartening, but
we've got our work cut out for it. Yes.

178
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:05,250
Yeah. I don't know who the candidate
Israeli, yeah. Uh, you know,

179
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:09,540
I write for Bloomberg, so I'm reluctant
to say Mike Bloomberg of the Democrats,

180
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:13,590
but he is in fact my favorite with
the caveat that I write for Bloomberg.

181
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:17,820
So I appreciate the Gavi. Otherwise the
Youtube commenters would of went bananas.

182
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:20,790
You don't want to deal with their wrath
wrath. What do you think about that?

183
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:23,830
Just the two party duopoly
that we have right now and,

184
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:27,900
and how hard it would be for say, a
more centrist candidate. Like even now,

185
00:10:27,901 --> 00:10:28,711
just in the last couple of days,

186
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:32,520
Howard Schultz of Starbucks is saying he
may jump in as an independent, and he,

187
00:10:32,521 --> 00:10:37,490
it sounds like he'd be a little bit more
of a centrist Democrats say than the

188
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:41,730
really far left progressive,
but at you tile endeavor,

189
00:10:41,731 --> 00:10:43,560
I believe in working through the parties.
Yeah.

190
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:46,080
There's much about Donald
Trump I disagree with,

191
00:10:46,081 --> 00:10:51,081
but he was effective because he decided
not doing the reform party bid from the

192
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:54,890
late nineties, but he would work through
one of the two major parties. Yeah. So on,

193
00:10:54,891 --> 00:10:59,250
on most of the issues that you talked
about in terms of regulation and freeing

194
00:10:59,251 --> 00:11:00,330
the economy and things like that,

195
00:11:00,331 --> 00:11:04,140
you've gotta be pretty pleased
with the trunk on regulation. Uh,

196
00:11:04,141 --> 00:11:06,840
the administration has slowed the pace,
uh,

197
00:11:06,841 --> 00:11:10,860
but on carbon and environmental issues,
I disagree with deregulation.

198
00:11:10,861 --> 00:11:15,400
I think we actually need to be tougher.
So even there, that's a mixed record. Uh,

199
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:18,480
Trump hasn't rolled back that much
regulation. This is too hard to do.

200
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:23,070
But the pace has been slowed. I'm
happy about that. Yeah. Is there a way,

201
00:11:23,071 --> 00:11:26,490
because our system is so huge and
our federal government is so big,

202
00:11:26,491 --> 00:11:28,410
is there really a way to do a lot of this?

203
00:11:28,411 --> 00:11:31,860
I think people sort of hear the
idea of let's roll back regulation,

204
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:36,210
let's you know, drain the swamp. All
of these phrases that, that sound good,

205
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:38,730
but then they get in office
and they realize that this,

206
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:43,850
this giant Federal Munster that is just
sucking money and employing all sorts of

207
00:11:45,091 --> 00:11:49,140
people that probably it shouldn't. And
all of this that it just doesn't change.

208
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,000
It's just the system is sort of corroded.

209
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:55,540
Our best bet is to invent new sectors
more quickly than they can be regulated.

210
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:59,590
So let's say for instance that virtual
reality where to really work and people

211
00:11:59,591 --> 00:12:02,620
would take to it. You could have
schools within virtual reality,

212
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:06,550
they would be unregulated. Not Out
of any government. Tolerance is just,

213
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:10,630
no law is set up to really regulate
virtual reality in any direct way.

214
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:15,190
So parts of the tech sector have
had a light hand of regulation,

215
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,510
not through anyone's wisdom.

216
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,060
They just started doing things
now and had been expecting.

217
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:22,180
And so there's a kind of race.
So do you believe,

218
00:12:22,181 --> 00:12:26,830
so you basically believe them that self
regulations within certain parameters

219
00:12:26,831 --> 00:12:29,740
does just happen.
It just sort of happens itself.

220
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:34,540
I'm glad we let Facebook and Uber happened
and that no one had to ask permission.

221
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:38,500
Do this company sometimes make
mistakes? Yes. Are they perfect? No.

222
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:43,450
Are we better off having them? Absolutely.
So if Uber had had to ask permission,

223
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:45,010
I imagine that,

224
00:12:45,011 --> 00:12:48,820
oh like 10 years from now we'll do a
pilot plan where like maybe a fifth of the

225
00:12:48,821 --> 00:12:53,470
drivers in Seattle do ride sharing and
most cities say no and they just did it.

226
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:54,790
I'm all for that.
Right.

227
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:57,400
And it always becomes a giant
government boondoggle anyway.

228
00:12:57,401 --> 00:13:00,670
If you look at the New York City taxis
with the used to cost about a million

229
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:04,090
bucks just to get one of those
medallions and then it's like there's no

230
00:13:04,091 --> 00:13:07,300
competition. So I'm worried ride
sharing will turn into that.

231
00:13:07,301 --> 00:13:09,580
But then there's always the new thing.
And again,

232
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:12,850
it's this kind of race where
innovation has to outpace regulation.

233
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,970
The nice thing about government
regulators is there a bit slow, right?

234
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,050
They're very formulistic. It takes some
time. Innovators can be very quick.

235
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:22,180
So is that the silver lining
more than anything else?

236
00:13:22,181 --> 00:13:24,400
That's the silver lining
up ugly aren't that great.

237
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:29,230
They're mostly conscientious. I mean,
they do the job, they're told to do.

238
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:32,500
There are countries with much worse
regulation than the United States.

239
00:13:32,501 --> 00:13:35,290
We should appreciate what we have.
But that said,

240
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:39,760
if you look at say occupational
licensing for barbers and beauticians are

241
00:13:39,761 --> 00:13:42,700
interior designers, in my opinion,
none of that should exist.

242
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:44,590
It should all simply disappear tomorrow.

243
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,990
So what would you say to the person
who would say, well, wait a minute.

244
00:13:46,991 --> 00:13:48,390
What if I go to,
uh,

245
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,550
get my haircut and this person hasn't
been licensed by the state and now they

246
00:13:51,551 --> 00:13:55,330
stabbed me in the head with the
scissor? Well, murders against the law,

247
00:13:55,331 --> 00:13:59,420
but I'm not sure the licensing stops
that the more competition here,

248
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:00,370
it's not just the license,

249
00:14:00,371 --> 00:14:02,650
it's stopping people from stabbing people
with scissors. Is that what you're,

250
00:14:02,651 --> 00:14:07,030
there should be laws against tos or
stabbing in my humble opinion. So, okay,

251
00:14:07,031 --> 00:14:10,570
so you talked a little bit about the,
the tech side of this.

252
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:12,130
Why is it that,

253
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:15,790
it seems to me that the people that I
know that are up in Silicon Valley and the

254
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:19,150
tech world in general is very,
very privately libertarian.

255
00:14:19,151 --> 00:14:21,610
These people want to innovate,
they want competition.

256
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,500
They want to do exactly
what you're saying,

257
00:14:23,501 --> 00:14:26,860
stay ahead of the regulators and figure
out new ways to do all sorts of things.

258
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,150
But outwardly,

259
00:14:28,151 --> 00:14:33,151
these companies seem extremely left and
extremely controlling and centralized.

260
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:36,520
Many tech companies are in California,

261
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:41,020
a lot of highly educated California
employees are very left wing.

262
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:43,990
Those employees pressure their companies.
Also,

263
00:14:43,991 --> 00:14:46,720
a lot of tech companies have big
contracts with the government,

264
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,150
which puts them in somewhat
of an awkward position.

265
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,980
And the ideal stands for
many companies tech or nod,

266
00:14:51,981 --> 00:14:54,050
it's just not to be in politics.

267
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:58,910
And I think most people in business would
rather compete as a business or get a

268
00:14:58,911 --> 00:15:01,190
favor from the government.
But the tech companies,

269
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:04,600
one of the miraculous things about
them is defense. Contracting aside,

270
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:09,620
their core model has been to supply
better products to users and not to curry

271
00:15:09,621 --> 00:15:12,410
favor with the state.
And to me that's highly admirable,

272
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:17,420
but are we entering an odd place where
they clearly do have relationships with

273
00:15:17,421 --> 00:15:21,320
the government at this point? Are we
entering a phase where this is where,

274
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:23,630
this is the great debate
right now in my world as a,

275
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:27,440
as a guy that's doing this on youtube
is have these companies gotten so out of

276
00:15:27,441 --> 00:15:31,010
control that there is now a threat
actually to the first amendment because

277
00:15:31,011 --> 00:15:34,820
basically there is government involvement
related to policing speech and are

278
00:15:34,821 --> 00:15:37,220
they platforms or publishers,
that sort of thing.

279
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:39,800
If I look at youtube or
a fly look at Twitter,

280
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:43,580
I think they have supported far more
freedom of speech than they have hindered.

281
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:47,690
And if you even ask like which set of
views had been helped the most by youtube

282
00:15:47,691 --> 00:15:48,524
and Twitter?

283
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:53,420
I suspect on average it's a mix of like
the right and some part of the radical

284
00:15:53,421 --> 00:15:56,510
left. But I don't think
overall right wing ideas,

285
00:15:56,511 --> 00:15:58,490
and that's not even the
correct way to put it,

286
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:01,250
but I don't think they've been harmed
by these media. Quite the contrary.

287
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:06,440
So I'm not as worked up about that issue
as some of my friends are. Yeah. But,

288
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:10,190
but either way you would, even if you
saw more of a threat there, you would,

289
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:10,941
there's no,

290
00:16:10,941 --> 00:16:14,850
is there any situation where you ever
believe the government should jump in and

291
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:17,330
do something?
Any is a tricky word,

292
00:16:17,331 --> 00:16:21,320
but I feel at current margins I would
rather the government not regulate tech

293
00:16:21,321 --> 00:16:24,800
companies more. Yeah. So just
free them up and just keep,

294
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:27,350
so you believe in human ingenuity
more than anything else? I mean,

295
00:16:27,351 --> 00:16:31,340
I think that that seems to be
the sure enforce rule of law.

296
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:34,970
I think the notion that, uh,
a platform is not liable,

297
00:16:34,971 --> 00:16:39,971
say for everything that platform is used
for as we set out in law in the 1990s

298
00:16:39,981 --> 00:16:41,330
was a fantastic idea.

299
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:45,790
It helped the Internet grow as quickly
as it did that equity capital could fund

300
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:48,470
a new ventures without being
obsessed with liability issues.

301
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:52,580
No one even knew at the time what
a smart thing that was to do. Uh,

302
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:56,570
so the genius of American government,
finally we did it kind of unintentionally.

303
00:16:57,050 --> 00:17:00,230
Usually the good things
are done unintentionally, I
think. Yeah. But you know,

304
00:17:00,231 --> 00:17:01,430
tech companies are vulnerable,

305
00:17:01,431 --> 00:17:05,450
so people think Facebook has a lock and
young people don't necessarily want to

306
00:17:05,451 --> 00:17:08,930
be on Facebook and a,
there's always competition.

307
00:17:08,931 --> 00:17:11,900
So my space was once considered,
you know, untouchable.

308
00:17:11,901 --> 00:17:16,130
They would rule social media forever and
American history is littered with the

309
00:17:16,131 --> 00:17:20,060
corpses of corporate giants that seemed
untouchable and basically went under.

310
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:25,040
So if David can be Goliath
than Dave can be. Google. Yes.

311
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:28,280
All right. I've got my work cut out for
me. So I was on your website this morning,

312
00:17:28,281 --> 00:17:30,920
marginal revolution.com which
I, first off, I love the name,

313
00:17:30,921 --> 00:17:33,170
but I want to get the
tagline totally right here.

314
00:17:33,171 --> 00:17:35,870
Small steps towards a much better world.

315
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:40,970
I thought that actually is pretty perfect
for a way of looking at the world that

316
00:17:40,971 --> 00:17:42,290
we need to fix things,

317
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:47,030
perhaps in the west with some small
steps with some marginal things on the

318
00:17:47,031 --> 00:17:47,864
outside.

319
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:50,850
But it seems like there's a movement
right now where people just want to rip up

320
00:17:50,851 --> 00:17:51,780
everything as if,

321
00:17:51,781 --> 00:17:56,100
as if nothing good has come out of the
200 plus years of freedom that we've had

322
00:17:56,101 --> 00:17:57,630
here.
Was that a little bit of,

323
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,330
of why I'm slowly came up with
the tagline in the first place.

324
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,370
We need to start with where we are.

325
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:06,720
It's not about designing society from
scratch and the West tends the best

326
00:18:06,721 --> 00:18:09,140
heritage, the best ideas. Um,

327
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:13,980
most effective religion that I think
our world has seen ever and we should

328
00:18:13,981 --> 00:18:17,830
embrace and cherish those things and yes,
modify them when appropriate.

329
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,080
But the American constitution is one of
the great works of genius of mankind.

330
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:26,510
Yeah. So how do we then, so what, let,

331
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:31,290
let's say your Bloomberg or somebody
that's your guy, let's say, well,

332
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:33,210
there's no one who's mind,
but somebody,

333
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:37,140
somebody who roof roughly holds these
ideas is, is in office tomorrow.

334
00:18:37,141 --> 00:18:39,870
Now I know you don't want to give
too much power to the executive,

335
00:18:39,871 --> 00:18:42,030
obviously because you're into
the constitution and all that.

336
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:44,430
What does this look like?
Well,

337
00:18:44,431 --> 00:18:48,750
I think the presidency of Trump shows
how little influence her president has.

338
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:50,730
Trump is in most ways a weak president.

339
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:55,400
Most of his policy agenda has not
happened. The courts have overruled him.

340
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,560
Our Congress won't act now.
The Democrats control the house.

341
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:02,760
So for me the key is her ideas
and broader society to change,

342
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:07,020
to try to be like a personal role model
for what you believe in and just to have

343
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:11,370
like your guy as president, you're a
woman as president, there's no such thing.

344
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:14,110
And if I were very happy
about intellection,

345
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:18,300
I just wouldn't feel that good about it.
I don't think it would matter that much.

346
00:19:18,301 --> 00:19:20,580
It's more about the broad
sweep of history. Yeah.

347
00:19:20,581 --> 00:19:23,790
So then is the key to
that that we have to stop.

348
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:27,900
I don't want people to become uninformed.
Obviously we need to be informed,

349
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,330
but that the key might be stopped.

350
00:19:30,331 --> 00:19:35,010
This sort of endless obsession with
politics right now. Does that strike you?

351
00:19:35,011 --> 00:19:39,360
It strikes me as dangerous that we've
turned politics into the national pastime.

352
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:43,920
It's a blood sport now and it's the way
you take people down and insult people.

353
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:48,690
So just the simple rule of how you would
treat people to their face or talk to

354
00:19:48,691 --> 00:19:49,530
them,
to their face,

355
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:55,280
that politics should be done by all
those same rules and just being genteel.

356
00:19:55,351 --> 00:19:57,720
I get that doesn't solve
our national problems,

357
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:02,010
but it stops some things from getting
worse and that's slipping away right now.

358
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:05,210
Yeah. What can we do?
So you think it's just,

359
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:09,990
just be nicer sort of at
least, well, different people
have different roles, right?

360
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:11,640
So maybe some people,

361
00:20:11,641 --> 00:20:16,410
it is their role to be a kind of Paul
revere of sorts, but other people,

362
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:20,910
you know our role models and they should
conduct civil intelligent conversations

363
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,760
and that is catching.
I see that on the Internet.

364
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:29,160
So if you look at the best material
on the Internet, how smart it is,

365
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:33,480
including a lot of podcasts and youtube
shows compared to what people thought

366
00:20:33,481 --> 00:20:35,850
was possible in the age
of Network television.

367
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,220
It's just astonishing
the intellectual level.

368
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:43,490
So I see right now even sort of within
my crew of of intellectual dark web

369
00:20:44,731 --> 00:20:46,880
people,
whatever this thing is a,

370
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:49,510
that there is sort of a split happening
where there's a certain amount of people

371
00:20:49,511 --> 00:20:50,530
that think we have to,

372
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:55,690
the institutions are changing say academia
and the media in New York Times and I

373
00:20:55,691 --> 00:20:58,360
realized that they're going through these
massive changes and we're watching all

374
00:20:58,361 --> 00:21:02,320
sorts of lay offs all over journalism
right now and there's a split where it's

375
00:21:02,321 --> 00:21:05,080
like some people are just like,
let it burn. It deserves to burn.

376
00:21:05,081 --> 00:21:08,020
It's time for it to burn and then
there's another version that's like,

377
00:21:08,021 --> 00:21:10,030
well if we don't prop these things up,

378
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,240
you know who the hell knows what's
going to come on the other side?

379
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,740
What do you think about that?

380
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:18,670
I would go back to this idea of small
steps toward a much better world.

381
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:21,820
Like what can I do so I
can write on the Internet,

382
00:21:21,821 --> 00:21:26,740
I can have my podcast series and I don't
have some big mega plan for what to do

383
00:21:26,741 --> 00:21:28,930
with the New York Times
or the Washington Post.

384
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:34,060
I'm genuinely not sure those outlets
will have to evolve with competitive

385
00:21:34,061 --> 00:21:35,260
pressures.
In any case,

386
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:38,470
I'm not like wishing for the
death of anything in particular.

387
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:43,330
And I think a the same set of people under
different circumstances can do a much

388
00:21:43,331 --> 00:21:44,860
better or much worse job.

389
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:50,100
So like I root for institutions to
succeed and not for their death. Uh,

390
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:53,050
but again, I focus on the,
what's my comparative advantage,

391
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:58,500
what do I see is missing at the margin
and really hone in on that like a laser.

392
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,590
Yeah. I mean I liked that and I,
I think it's what I've tried to,

393
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,490
what you're doing to build here.

394
00:22:03,491 --> 00:22:06,640
It's that I believe that usually the
things that I'm talking about here are the

395
00:22:06,641 --> 00:22:07,690
right set of ideas.

396
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:11,710
And I don't mind having a difference
of opinion obviously with guests,

397
00:22:11,711 --> 00:22:15,070
but trying to keep it relatively civil
and worse added on Twitter than I am in

398
00:22:15,071 --> 00:22:19,330
here. Uh, and hopefully people
can start thinking for themselves.

399
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:23,290
So what if I ask you like, what should
we do with the Rotary Club in Houston?

400
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:27,820
I mean, you don't know, right? Not
specifically. Yeah. Tell me. Okay.

401
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:30,190
I don't know either. That's an
interesting point. What do you,

402
00:22:30,191 --> 00:22:30,941
what do you make of that,

403
00:22:30,941 --> 00:22:34,030
that everyone feels they have to
have an opinion on everything. Yeah.

404
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:35,320
The second something happens,

405
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:37,840
everyone knows everything
about the nuclear deal in Iran.

406
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:40,570
Everyone knows everything about what's
going on in North Korea and everyone

407
00:22:40,571 --> 00:22:43,490
knows everything about, you know, the
tax margins and everything else. It's,

408
00:22:43,491 --> 00:22:47,020
it's crazy. Actually, you know,
one of the themes in my book,

409
00:22:47,021 --> 00:22:51,310
stubborn attachments is on most issues.
Yes. You should do what you think is best,

410
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:55,750
but the chance that you are exactly
right is actually pretty low. Yeah.

411
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,360
And Act and talk with that in mind.

412
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:02,560
So the first I want to get
the first sentence right. Uh,

413
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:07,360
the first sentence is growth
is good. Economic growth. Yeah.

414
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,710
Personal growth too.
But yeah. Well it sends,

415
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,850
you were talking about economic growth,

416
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:13,990
but in a way you are talking
about personal growth. Sure. Um,

417
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,380
when we talk about growth, so what
does, what does that mean beyond, okay,

418
00:23:17,381 --> 00:23:18,214
you can say the,

419
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:21,430
the economy grew an extra percent
this year or that sort of thing. Like,

420
00:23:21,431 --> 00:23:24,810
can you put that into some sort of more
layman's terms for the average person

421
00:23:24,811 --> 00:23:27,040
that isn't particularly
interested in economics,

422
00:23:27,041 --> 00:23:31,090
why growth is is the important
thing that that led off your book.

423
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:35,320
If you take a time period of like a
bout a hundred years and you have the

424
00:23:35,321 --> 00:23:39,550
American economy grow one percentage
point lower over that time period,

425
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:44,140
we would today have the national wealth.
I've Mexico, not the United States.

426
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,760
So in any given year,
a percentage point of growth,

427
00:23:46,761 --> 00:23:50,810
like maybe it's not that big a deal,
but over time as it compounds,

428
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:54,500
it's the difference
between riches and poverty.

429
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:57,350
The ability to have a job where
you're somewhat in control,

430
00:23:57,650 --> 00:24:00,830
the ability to have more scope
for creative action in your life,

431
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:05,780
the near certainty your children will
not die when they're very young to take

432
00:24:05,781 --> 00:24:08,900
care of your parents, better, to
have access to the best medicines,

433
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,640
to be able to travel the world.

434
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:12,890
All of these things and
people want different things,

435
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:17,660
but wealthier societies do a much
better job at giving us those things,

436
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:21,260
including sustaining democracy.
So economic growth in my view,

437
00:24:21,261 --> 00:24:22,430
is centrally important.

438
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:27,080
Why do you think so many people believe
that that has not occurred here or

439
00:24:27,081 --> 00:24:29,720
something like people
don't want to accept?

440
00:24:29,721 --> 00:24:32,510
I see this at colleges all the time when
I go to talk to colleges and these kids

441
00:24:32,511 --> 00:24:35,630
think that they're oppressed and that
something horrible is happening in the

442
00:24:35,631 --> 00:24:39,170
United States right now and the only way
that I've been able to break through to

443
00:24:39,171 --> 00:24:42,910
them. I always ask the same question and
I've had nobody argued with me. I say,

444
00:24:42,911 --> 00:24:46,040
just anyone in this room have it
worse than their grandparents.

445
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,760
And it has yet to happen where
someone raises their hand. Yes and no.

446
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:53,330
I'm sure it has happened where somebody
grandparents were super wealthy and lost

447
00:24:53,331 --> 00:24:53,421
it,

448
00:24:53,421 --> 00:24:57,050
but that would also be an argument sort
of against leftist economics because it

449
00:24:57,051 --> 00:24:58,730
would show that you can
lose a lot of wealth,

450
00:24:58,731 --> 00:25:01,880
which they would want because they
don't want well to be accumulated.

451
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:06,800
But why do you think this idea that
somehow things haven't gotten consistently

452
00:25:06,801 --> 00:25:10,130
so much better, which there is
so much empirical evidence of,

453
00:25:10,131 --> 00:25:14,030
why do you think that hasn't taken
root say with younger people?

454
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:16,670
Some of it is Myopia.
Some of it of course,

455
00:25:16,671 --> 00:25:20,120
is that younger people have not
been on this earth for very long.

456
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:23,600
Some of it is we have taught
too much egalitarianisms.

457
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:26,270
Some of it is I think our society perhaps.
Can you,

458
00:25:26,271 --> 00:25:27,770
can you explain what you mean by that?
Again,

459
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:31,310
Lateri aneurysm is the notion that if
one person has something and the other

460
00:25:31,311 --> 00:25:34,610
doesn't,
that may be that's automatically wrong.

461
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:38,900
Even if the other person's pretty well
off or well off by world historical

462
00:25:38,901 --> 00:25:42,500
standards and I think that's
very often a harmful videology.

463
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:47,450
I would do more to teach like when we in
plus economic growth types of thinking

464
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:53,270
that America is a more secular society.
I think it just creates a vacuum.

465
00:25:53,271 --> 00:25:54,710
I'm not myself religious,

466
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:58,970
but I think religion plays an important
role in giving us a framework and when

467
00:25:58,971 --> 00:26:03,971
that framework has taken away a lot
of ideas enter the vacuum that can be

468
00:26:04,161 --> 00:26:07,820
harmful. Do you see that happening
right now? I do. Quickly. Yeah.

469
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:08,960
I definitely see that.

470
00:26:08,961 --> 00:26:11,600
And I say that is someone that's not
particularly really and especially on the

471
00:26:11,601 --> 00:26:13,670
left,
which is less religious than the right.

472
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:18,880
So is that what's happening that they've
sort of traded religious thought or you

473
00:26:19,491 --> 00:26:23,240
know an unmoved mover or some sort
of beginning of this whole thing.

474
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:26,960
They've traded it in for a series
of ideas that are just about,

475
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:29,870
I mean it sounds Cliche,
but how they feel now,

476
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:34,280
not enough about a higher purpose of some
kind and one can have a purely secular

477
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:37,580
vision of that higher purpose,
which is how I see myself.

478
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:42,650
But religion is a very easy persuasive
way for many people to get there and we

479
00:26:42,651 --> 00:26:46,500
are secularizing finally in this country.
That's one of my greatest concerns.

480
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:49,560
Is that funny for you as a, as
a secular person? Absolutely.

481
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:52,230
Cause I've never been religious.
My parents were not religious.

482
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:57,410
But when I look at the actual data and
also religious people tend to have more

483
00:26:57,781 --> 00:26:59,400
children, I believe in, you know,

484
00:26:59,401 --> 00:27:03,750
a populous America that is not like a
tiny country compared to India and China.

485
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:08,250
And it's one reason why I would like to
make immigration work better and taking

486
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:12,450
more immigrants. I think we should
be a strong country of 500 million,

487
00:27:12,451 --> 00:27:16,170
600 million if China and India
are going to be over a billion.

488
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:18,330
So I had a couple of weeks ago I had uh,

489
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:20,810
Heather McDonald in here who you're
probably familiar with. Sure. She,

490
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:23,900
she talks about being a secular
conservative. Now I know you're,

491
00:27:23,901 --> 00:27:27,310
you're a small l libertarian, right?
If we're going with labels, um,

492
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:31,470
but do you think there is room on the
right for a secular movement to grow?

493
00:27:31,471 --> 00:27:33,450
Because I think that
would be pretty powerful.

494
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:36,090
And I see some seeds of it
actually happening right now.

495
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,290
I don't libertarians generally or don't
care what your belief tend to be secular.

496
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:44,100
Yeah. I think there will have to
be right. And the secular society.

497
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:48,750
So, uh, I think there's right now more
intellectual ferment on the right.

498
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:50,700
It strikes me,
especially on Twitter,

499
00:27:50,701 --> 00:27:53,880
but not only how much left wingers
attack each other, you know,

500
00:27:53,881 --> 00:27:57,630
people who support different candidates.
This person's terrible, this one is evil.

501
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:02,070
Joe Biden did this. I think that's much
worse on the left now than on the right.

502
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:07,230
And uh, it's partly because they
have fewer ideas to talk about.

503
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:11,010
And I find a,
to bring up an unusual idea,

504
00:28:11,011 --> 00:28:14,550
you will get further on the
right currently than on the left.

505
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:18,420
And that's actually a positive sign.
So what do you make of that positive sign?

506
00:28:18,421 --> 00:28:20,330
Because if you, I mean I think,
you know, I know, you know,

507
00:28:20,331 --> 00:28:22,320
you know a bit about my
political evolution. I mean,

508
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:26,520
if you would've asked me five years ago
that most of the people that I agree

509
00:28:26,521 --> 00:28:30,060
with would be libertarians and
conservatives, or at the very least,

510
00:28:30,061 --> 00:28:33,150
even though I'm still pro choice and I
know some of them aren't thrilled with,

511
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:36,450
with gay marriage and I'm against the
death penalty and a whole bunch of other

512
00:28:36,451 --> 00:28:41,451
things that these people
would be extremely opening
open to always sitting down

513
00:28:41,461 --> 00:28:44,610
with me. And on the other side
there's, there's almost nothing left.

514
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:48,660
It's a reason to be optimistic.
If you look, say at the 1960s,

515
00:28:48,661 --> 00:28:50,880
seventies people on the right,

516
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:54,450
I think we're more open or maybe
even more talented than on the left.

517
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:56,640
And they were at that time losing.

518
00:28:56,641 --> 00:28:59,910
But you then have the eighties
and nineties where some
of the classical liberal

519
00:28:59,911 --> 00:29:04,690
ideas become much more powerful.
Communism falls. And then I think, uh,

520
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:05,940
some point in the 90s,

521
00:29:05,941 --> 00:29:09,940
there's actually a lot more talent and
openness on the left and the right style

522
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:12,600
defies, wow, we beat communism.
What do we do now? Well,

523
00:29:12,601 --> 00:29:14,700
that's when they went after
video games, right? I mean, yes.

524
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:15,760
And that was a big mistake.

525
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:18,910
The Republican is attacking video
games and Mccain and it's like what?

526
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:23,230
And they embrace too many politicians who
are intolerant or telling lies or just

527
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:27,180
being irresponsible. And a lot of
the right is still in that Rut.

528
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:31,170
But I think if you look at intellectual
discourse, it's better on the right.

529
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:36,300
That may well again, be a
historical leading indicator
of change. Maybe not soon,

530
00:29:36,301 --> 00:29:40,640
but 20 years from now, I think there'll
be a payoff. Yeah. God, I, I, well,

531
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:43,000
I think it's happening. I actually
do think it's happening right now,

532
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:47,070
but I didn't ugly, twisted, painful ways.
Right. It's never easy or pleasant. Yeah.

533
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:47,801
Do you sense,

534
00:29:47,801 --> 00:29:51,520
we're sort of in the death throes of
something right now that between the

535
00:29:51,521 --> 00:29:56,521
institutions kind of wavering and with
all the free speech stuff on campus and

536
00:29:57,190 --> 00:29:58,510
just so much tension.

537
00:29:58,511 --> 00:30:00,850
You've mentioned social media a couple
of times that there's so many things

538
00:30:00,851 --> 00:30:01,660
happening at once.

539
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:04,700
The way this is all speeding up
faster and faster and wherever you are

540
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,670
organizing discourse around the Internet,

541
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:09,760
which is a good thing and
will be a very good thing,

542
00:30:09,761 --> 00:30:12,160
but it's extremely
painful for many people.

543
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:14,440
I think that's one of
the big changes going on.

544
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,140
I actually think America is depolarizing.

545
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,330
I'm not saying that's a pleasant process,

546
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:23,620
but if you go to someone in Congress
like what do you think about free trade?

547
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:27,160
And you hear their opinion right now
you can't necessarily tell if they're a

548
00:30:27,161 --> 00:30:30,940
republican or a democrat or someone
who wants to increase, you know,

549
00:30:30,941 --> 00:30:32,710
social security,
government spending.

550
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:37,240
They could be a republican or a Democrat
and that wasn't the case. And you know,

551
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:42,690
2011 or 2013 so what people are calling
polarization is the stakes are higher.

552
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:47,350
What is possible through politics
is becoming greater and grander.

553
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:50,920
So there's more hatred,
more mutual recrimination,

554
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:53,950
but people are just all over the map
in terms of what they believe. Yeah.

555
00:30:53,951 --> 00:30:58,510
Well I do think it's a,
it's a rich ground for ideas right now,

556
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:02,410
but it's higher risk to, yeah. Yeah. So
it could, it could spin out of control.

557
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:06,430
Correct. I guess podcast host have a
lot of responsibility right now. Well,

558
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:07,021
we all do.

559
00:31:07,021 --> 00:31:11,920
And some sense of personal mission in
the old standard American Protestant

560
00:31:11,921 --> 00:31:13,600
sense,
even if you're totally secular,

561
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:18,930
to take that notion of a personal mission
upon yourself and go and do it to me

562
00:31:19,121 --> 00:31:22,720
is just critically important,
isn't it? Like to me that's it.

563
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:25,420
It's your life. Grab it, go with it.

564
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:30,070
Demand as much freedom as you can possibly
build for out of this world and take

565
00:31:30,071 --> 00:31:32,890
it. And yet that message
right now for young people,

566
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:37,891
unfortunately it's not catching it on the
way shit and it or maybe it is to your

567
00:31:38,111 --> 00:31:42,580
point. Yeah. And also understand we
have some origins as a puritan nation.

568
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:45,070
I'm not saying be a puritan,
not at all,

569
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:49,360
but that has given America a cultural
strength and ability to support people who

570
00:31:49,361 --> 00:31:53,710
do this in terms of openness and
resources and the culture surrounding you,

571
00:31:53,711 --> 00:31:56,800
how much encouragement and you will
find how big an audience you can build.

572
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:59,410
So early things like
blogging and podcasting,

573
00:31:59,411 --> 00:32:03,190
just how American those are we
take for granted. But it's a deep,

574
00:32:03,191 --> 00:32:07,150
fundamentally important truth that
Americans are sometimes Canadians,

575
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:10,120
Jordan Peterson has been
the leaders in this area.

576
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:12,160
I don't think we appreciate enough.
Yeah.

577
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:15,460
Is anyone else doing
it better than America?

578
00:32:15,461 --> 00:32:17,590
Is anyone else doing basics of,

579
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:22,030
of freedom and liberty and the type of
economics that you're talking about?

580
00:32:22,031 --> 00:32:24,480
Is anyone doing it better?
Better is a tricky word.

581
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:28,870
I think Australia and Canada as
countries are in pretty good shape.

582
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:32,590
Uh, not with respect to political
liberty, but in many areas.

583
00:32:32,591 --> 00:32:36,310
I'm a fan of Singapore.
They have done in economic policy very,

584
00:32:36,311 --> 00:32:40,070
very well and they have become
overall freer than they used to be.

585
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,560
Uh,
you know,

586
00:32:42,561 --> 00:32:46,430
western Europe in some ways
has a wonderful lifestyle,

587
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:49,700
but for me it's somewhat
deadening and not that innovative,

588
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:55,000
but for cultivating like quality of
consumption and how to enjoy leisure. Uh,

589
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,320
not really my thing in many ways,

590
00:32:57,321 --> 00:33:00,730
but there are definitely ahead of us and
we should like value that and learned

591
00:33:00,731 --> 00:33:02,360
something from it.
What are,

592
00:33:02,361 --> 00:33:05,990
what are some of the economic ideas
or principles that we're not paying

593
00:33:05,991 --> 00:33:08,150
attention to you that we
should, if you're, you know,

594
00:33:08,151 --> 00:33:10,130
like there's people talking about ubi now,

595
00:33:10,131 --> 00:33:12,230
there's people talking about all
this stuff with automation. I mean,

596
00:33:12,231 --> 00:33:14,150
what should we be,
we're looking at the future now.

597
00:33:14,151 --> 00:33:16,790
What are things that we should
be focusing on learning about?

598
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:19,430
What I'm seeing is people
forgetting a lot of basics.

599
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:23,780
So ubi I find attempting idea,
but I don't favor it. I want,

600
00:33:23,781 --> 00:33:27,290
can you steal magnet for those
that don't know what ubi,

601
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:31,070
universal basic income, the notion,
there's different versions of the scheme,

602
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:35,450
but government sends everyone money to
support them as a kind of social welfare.

603
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:39,140
So just like a baseline everyone's
got and yes, go from there. Yeah.

604
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:42,050
Now I believe in some kind of baseline.
So if you're disabled,

605
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:46,910
I believe you should receive a significant
baseline if you need assistance.

606
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:51,020
I think for the most part we should pay
people to work, not pay them not to work.

607
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:54,680
So we have the earned income tax credit.
If you work and your poor,

608
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,570
the government pays you extra money.

609
00:33:56,930 --> 00:34:01,130
I think that has worked quite well and
attract a better quality of immigrant

610
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:04,100
when you pay people to work rather
than paying them not to work.

611
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,620
Too Much of western Europe
pays people not to work.

612
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:09,650
So the forums of aid we give,

613
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:14,690
they are cultural symbols and they are
potent and the idea that it is automatic,

614
00:34:14,691 --> 00:34:16,760
any eternal that you just get cash.

615
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:22,040
It's telling people the main thing of
importance in life is cash and you will

616
00:34:22,041 --> 00:34:23,030
get it no matter what.

617
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:28,090
It's the wrong message to send and he's
it stealing the exact idea that you've

618
00:34:29,391 --> 00:34:31,100
been talking about for the last half hour,

619
00:34:31,101 --> 00:34:34,490
which is sort of you've
got to innovate in life.

620
00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:36,950
It's stealing that idea
from the individual, right?

621
00:34:36,951 --> 00:34:39,380
We're just going to give you something.
If you don't do anything,

622
00:34:39,381 --> 00:34:42,800
you'll be able to subsist Dane at
the bottom of the tower forever.

623
00:34:42,890 --> 00:34:45,770
Even though obviously there are always
going to want more and more for that.

624
00:34:45,771 --> 00:34:45,951
Right.

625
00:34:45,951 --> 00:34:49,160
That's not just going to get ubi day
one and then it's going to be like that

626
00:34:49,161 --> 00:34:50,480
three years later.
Correct.

627
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:53,750
But that said we should find ways of
helping the needy. I'm all for that.

628
00:34:54,170 --> 00:34:57,140
What's the right way to do it?
I don't think it's ubi. Yeah.

629
00:34:57,470 --> 00:35:00,740
What else that we should be thinking
about that's popping up right now?

630
00:35:00,741 --> 00:35:01,221
Like when you're,

631
00:35:01,221 --> 00:35:03,830
when you're in economics conferences
and things and people are talking about

632
00:35:03,831 --> 00:35:06,230
what's going on in the future,
which we be thinking about.

633
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:10,220
I'm not sure how to fix climate change.
I think it's a very important issue.

634
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:14,120
I very much favor nuclear power.
I hope nuclear fuel it. Let's,

635
00:35:14,121 --> 00:35:16,640
let's do one at a time. So climate
change, do you think this could be,

636
00:35:16,641 --> 00:35:19,430
I see a movement now it's coming
from the right actually. Yes.

637
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:24,020
Where there are people saying there are
ways to tackle this that could be done

638
00:35:24,021 --> 00:35:26,900
through private enterprise and
not purely through the government.

639
00:35:26,901 --> 00:35:30,320
And I know you said you want
some regulation that that
is a place where you see

640
00:35:30,321 --> 00:35:32,570
the government doing something
related to the environment, right?

641
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:36,500
But do you see as some sort of partnership
there perhaps you also need to free

642
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:38,830
up energy competition,
so,

643
00:35:38,831 --> 00:35:42,060
so you try to build wind turbines
in different parts of America.

644
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:44,460
Homeowners say not near my house.
Right.

645
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:47,820
There's a kind of Nimby mentality
that should be much easier.

646
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:51,870
I know it doesn't always look pretty.
You drive from La to palm springs,

647
00:35:51,871 --> 00:35:56,400
you see all the wind turbines, but
it is cheap, clean, green energy.

648
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:59,970
And if you really think climate change
is a problem, you should jump on board.

649
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:03,750
Nuclear Energy, in my
opinion, can be safe. France,

650
00:36:03,751 --> 00:36:05,640
Sweden have done it just fine.

651
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:08,730
I'm optimistic about the
prospects for nuclear fusion,

652
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:12,330
which can be safer yet
than nuclear fishing.

653
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:15,840
And this is a place where you think the
government should be leading? Correct.

654
00:36:16,890 --> 00:36:21,840
Or leading is a tricky word
for nuclear power to operate.

655
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:26,400
I do think nuclear plant operators need
a special kind of liability insurance,

656
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:28,830
which we've provided under
the price Anderson Act,

657
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:32,550
and that has a role for government.
And I'm fine by that.

658
00:36:32,551 --> 00:36:36,870
I think it's much better than dealing
with all of the secondary costs of higher

659
00:36:36,871 --> 00:36:39,900
air pollution.
So I don't think it can be laissez faire,

660
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:44,370
but also you have to free up the market
so entrepreneurs can do this. Right.

661
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:47,940
Do you like, like I've sat
down here with a couple, uh,

662
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:50,300
and cat people that really just wanted,
you know,

663
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:54,240
disassemble the governmental altogether
and enter their mad max phase.

664
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:57,150
I really like the idea intellectually,

665
00:36:57,151 --> 00:37:00,750
like I liked seeing how far you can take
an intellectual argument and how much

666
00:37:00,751 --> 00:37:02,730
government could disappear.

667
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:07,880
Do you like entertaining those ideas just
purely for just purely for your mind?

668
00:37:07,981 --> 00:37:09,390
If not for practicality,

669
00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:13,680
it's very important to entertain them
or learn something from them. But again,

670
00:37:13,681 --> 00:37:15,510
we have to start from where we're at.

671
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:19,650
There's a lot of things government does
that probably they're impossible to undo

672
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:22,460
even if they're unwise American.

673
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:25,710
And that's why I was asking you before
that we have this machine that is so big

674
00:37:25,711 --> 00:37:29,250
that it's not like you should just come
in and something like social security.

675
00:37:29,251 --> 00:37:31,980
You may not have designed it
from scratch the way we have it,

676
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:35,430
but I'm not sure there's a way to back
out and undo it all because you're caught

677
00:37:35,431 --> 00:37:38,110
in a cycle where people have been
promised payments. Right? Yeah.

678
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:42,610
So maybe you know, just live with that one
and try to fix some other things. Yeah.

679
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,430
I'm sort of all over the place here,

680
00:37:44,431 --> 00:37:48,270
but what do you think about crypto
related to all this in a changing economy?

681
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:53,490
I think there's a 20% chance crypto
will pay off big time, but not now.

682
00:37:53,491 --> 00:37:55,380
Maybe in 2030 years from now.

683
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:59,580
Just the way quantum mechanics at the
time seemed weird and much later it became

684
00:37:59,581 --> 00:38:00,810
a central for computers,

685
00:38:01,290 --> 00:38:04,530
but right now it seems to me the
crypto revolution is failing.

686
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:08,280
What was promised has
not really come to us.

687
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,950
I'm not upset that the
price of Bitcoin is low.

688
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:16,080
I see a lot of potential for the notion
of self executing market contracts.

689
00:38:16,081 --> 00:38:19,590
In a crypto system.
I just don't see that right now.

690
00:38:19,591 --> 00:38:23,220
Consumers have problems where they're
clamoring for this as the solution.

691
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:26,400
So I could see us getting there.
Right? So in a bizarre way,

692
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,860
if the problems of today exacerbate,

693
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:34,220
then maybe that funnels this all to crypto
answers and also crypto may need more

694
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:37,660
infrastructure.
So you look at a possible use of Crypto,

695
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:40,120
well verifying individual identities,

696
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:43,220
possibly crypto is much
better at that than you.

697
00:38:43,221 --> 00:38:44,710
You're with someone on
the phone and they say,

698
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:48,820
what are the last four digits of your
social? Right? That's crazy system.

699
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:51,160
But for Crypto, right? We've just,

700
00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:54,250
we've just accepted that we're
giving it to all sorts of strangers,

701
00:38:54,251 --> 00:38:58,210
most likely Asia, right? Every time
we pick up the phone and go crazy.

702
00:38:58,211 --> 00:39:00,610
But it doesn't mean you can fix
it quickly just by having crypto.

703
00:39:00,611 --> 00:39:04,810
Now there's a whole system built that way
with payments companies and government

704
00:39:04,811 --> 00:39:08,890
bureaus and your personal data is
encoded with your social security number,

705
00:39:08,891 --> 00:39:12,430
your tax returns.
Even if crypto is the answer there,

706
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:17,170
it will be such an awkward
roundabout route, just like
for cars to be a big deal.

707
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:20,410
Well, you needed roads, you needed
service stations, you needed spare parts.

708
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:24,400
And it took about 40 years for us to
put together like the network of cars to

709
00:39:24,401 --> 00:39:25,630
revolutionize the world.

710
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:30,100
So I think a lot of people
are over promising crypto
in the short run and there

711
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:32,920
is a very real chance it just
dies out and doesn't work.

712
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:37,780
But I don't think it's all some fraud or
bubble. Uh, there's real potential there.

713
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:42,250
We don't yet know if it can work. The rest
of the infrastructure is not in place.

714
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:45,550
Probably in the short run it will fail.
But I still hold that hope.

715
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:48,480
I have to say there's a
certain pleasantness to
everything you're talking about

716
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:51,910
because you're sort of just telling people
to take a breath for a second. Right?

717
00:39:51,911 --> 00:39:54,890
I mean that, that sort of economically,
but personally, everything,

718
00:39:54,891 --> 00:39:59,530
I was just kind of slow down a
little bit for all of our problems.

719
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:03,430
The world is a hall has never been
in better shape than it is today.

720
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:07,540
2019 never ever. So just keep
that in mind. And you know,

721
00:40:07,541 --> 00:40:09,760
gratitude is good for
your personal development.

722
00:40:09,761 --> 00:40:13,540
Like people who keep gratitude
journals, uh, it seems they're happier,

723
00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:15,300
they're more productive.
Uh,

724
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:19,420
my gratitude journal I guess is my blog
in a funny way or podcasts, but, uh,

725
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:25,330
try to have some version of a gratitude
journal in your life. Do you think as a,

726
00:40:25,331 --> 00:40:27,860
as an interviewer, uh, that,

727
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:32,560
that you actually do learn every week?
I think one of the things I'm most,

728
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:37,270
I have most gratitude for is that
I genuinely learn every week.

729
00:40:37,271 --> 00:40:41,680
And I forget that the average person
doesn't get to learn every week.

730
00:40:41,681 --> 00:40:44,320
Or maybe it doesn't take time to learn
everything you could learn every week.

731
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:48,400
But I mean, I sit across incredible
people all the time and it's like, wow,

732
00:40:48,401 --> 00:40:49,450
I learned something.

733
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:52,420
Or at least I sat with someone who
knows something that I don't know.

734
00:40:52,421 --> 00:40:54,220
It's incredible. I mean, you
get that same opportunity.

735
00:40:54,221 --> 00:40:55,990
We've had many of the same guess,
not over the years.

736
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:59,170
Prepping for interviews is right
now the main way I learned.

737
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:02,980
But most people now also have this
chance to learn every week. Podcasts,

738
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:05,730
other forms of the Internet.
Uh,

739
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:09,400
cable TV is much better than
television used to be. Netflix,

740
00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:11,590
so there's a lot more access for learning.

741
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:16,030
How do you decide how much prep you're
supposed to do? Because I find sometimes,

742
00:41:16,031 --> 00:41:20,230
occasionally I want to know a little bit
less because I find that it'll allow me

743
00:41:20,231 --> 00:41:21,880
to explore during the interview more.

744
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,210
Sometimes I need to know a lot of
very specific factual information or

745
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,730
chronological information.
When I did your show,

746
00:41:27,731 --> 00:41:32,410
I was truly impressed how deep you had
dug into my past and you asked me things

747
00:41:32,411 --> 00:41:35,960
that nobody had ever asked me
before I go crazy over prepping.

748
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:40,010
So for Agnes calories, I read Plato's
symposium five times in a row.

749
00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:42,020
That's a lot of prep.
Emily Wilson,

750
00:41:42,021 --> 00:41:47,021
she just trained retranslated Homer's
Odyssey olive read that three times and

751
00:41:47,301 --> 00:41:51,770
she did Seneca's plays and she wrote a
biography of Seneca and wrote a book on

752
00:41:51,771 --> 00:41:54,500
over living and a book
about the death of Socrates.

753
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:57,920
And I'll read all of those and
reread some of the underlying texts.

754
00:41:58,490 --> 00:42:02,300
And her sister, uh, wrote a
book on the history of the fork,

755
00:42:02,330 --> 00:42:04,910
which I've already read and
has some other books on food.

756
00:42:04,911 --> 00:42:07,610
I'm going to read some of the books that
her sister book on the history of the

757
00:42:07,611 --> 00:42:08,750
fort.
And it's a wonderful book.

758
00:42:08,751 --> 00:42:13,250
It's called consider the fork forks a
report in there that I thought you meant.

759
00:42:13,251 --> 00:42:15,860
Maybe that's an economic term.
The flow, not crypto for,

760
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:20,690
I mean the fork dinner table for literal
fork. Yeah. So people's families,

761
00:42:20,691 --> 00:42:23,780
if people, uh, have, you know, a sibling
or a spouse who have done things,

762
00:42:23,781 --> 00:42:24,321
I figure we'll,

763
00:42:24,321 --> 00:42:28,130
of course the person has thought about
this and they probably have interesting

764
00:42:28,131 --> 00:42:30,740
ideas about it that are not
out there anywhere. Yeah.

765
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:34,520
So you'd rather talk about ideas more
than, than any. Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah.

766
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:37,820
Like the nitty gritty of the day to day,

767
00:42:37,821 --> 00:42:40,760
that's when I see all these people
fighting over this policy, that policy.

768
00:42:40,761 --> 00:42:43,880
It bores me to no end at this point.
It doesn't seem,

769
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:47,410
it seems meaningless or valueless.

770
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:51,910
It's overreacting to the
most recent signal in those
ideas, which are, you know,

771
00:42:51,950 --> 00:42:56,450
eternal, uh, will be with us and actually
be more influential. Yeah. So that's a,

772
00:42:56,451 --> 00:42:59,920
that's an interesting segue actually
to college campuses because you're,

773
00:42:59,921 --> 00:43:02,460
you're teaching actually her,
first of all,

774
00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:06,890
it has economics at least from your
position been infected by a lot of what

775
00:43:06,891 --> 00:43:09,770
we're seeing in the wider sense on
college campuses related to free speech,

776
00:43:09,771 --> 00:43:13,080
shouting down speakers. Cause even if
I find this all the time, if, you know,

777
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:15,500
people will come up to me after
events and they'll say, you know,

778
00:43:15,501 --> 00:43:20,480
I want to tell my boss or something that,
or my spouse that I'm for low taxes.

779
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:24,920
But if I say that they're going to say
I'm racist. I mean really crazy stuff. Um,

780
00:43:24,950 --> 00:43:28,610
so as someone that takes the small
l libertarian approach on this,

781
00:43:28,910 --> 00:43:33,470
do you find that some of these
ideas are infecting not so much.

782
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:38,270
Economics is a much healthier field.
It has a tradition as being maybe more,

783
00:43:38,271 --> 00:43:41,570
conservative isn't the right word,
but more market oriented.

784
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:43,640
A lot of people disagree with me,

785
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:47,270
so I'm an economist so I think
register is about 80% democratic,

786
00:43:47,690 --> 00:43:49,910
but they tend to be more
conservative Democrats.

787
00:43:50,690 --> 00:43:54,350
And I don't find that much just
outright bias. When I say things,

788
00:43:54,830 --> 00:43:59,150
I feel mostly accepted and
indeed even welcome. Yeah, no,

789
00:43:59,151 --> 00:44:02,240
I know George Mason obviously
is a certain specific thing,

790
00:44:02,330 --> 00:44:04,310
but in general when I
visit other campuses,

791
00:44:04,311 --> 00:44:07,730
I just spoke at University of
Michigan to the philosophy department,

792
00:44:07,731 --> 00:44:11,120
but I spoke to them and bad economics.
I'm going to U Chicago.

793
00:44:11,790 --> 00:44:13,490
I don't expect any trouble at all.

794
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:15,830
I don't think I'll say
anything incendiary either.

795
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:17,750
Just like my version of common sense.

796
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:20,270
Here's why you should have a
more positive view of the world.

797
00:44:20,271 --> 00:44:21,200
Here's what we can do.

798
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:24,140
Here are the small steps toward a much
better world that we should embrace.

799
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:28,370
I think it's going to go fine.
Sounds pretty hate speech.
He to me. Wow. We'll see.

800
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:30,110
I suppose.

801
00:44:30,110 --> 00:44:33,570
What would you say is the best to deal
then with what's going on on campuses?

802
00:44:33,571 --> 00:44:37,380
Even if you're not getting it and maybe
it's not happening directly in economics

803
00:44:37,381 --> 00:44:38,101
departments right now.

804
00:44:38,101 --> 00:44:41,790
I mean we're seeing it leak into into
biology departments when we're talking

805
00:44:41,791 --> 00:44:43,590
about gender and all
sorts of other things.

806
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:46,140
What do you think the best
way to push against this?

807
00:44:46,170 --> 00:44:50,460
The sort of corroding of academic freedom.
And if I look up my own school,

808
00:44:50,470 --> 00:44:53,460
George Mason,
we have a very good record in this regard.

809
00:44:53,461 --> 00:44:55,800
We have the highest tree
speed trading from fire,

810
00:44:55,860 --> 00:45:00,860
a group you know about and our school I
think has about more immigrant students

811
00:45:01,201 --> 00:45:04,860
or children of immigrants than any
other major university in America.

812
00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:06,630
And their attitude is so different.

813
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:10,290
They want to get an education to learn
something and to make a good living.

814
00:45:10,590 --> 00:45:14,190
And they're very practically oriented.
A lot of them are very curious.

815
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:20,120
And to them this is political correctness
is often a form of nonsense and it

816
00:45:20,671 --> 00:45:23,610
seems to me a disease of kind
of rich white kids' schools.

817
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:28,110
So I think we need to be more cosmopolitan
and just less provincial America has

818
00:45:28,111 --> 00:45:31,500
a long history of being provincial
and this is the new form of American

819
00:45:31,501 --> 00:45:33,930
provincial ism.
All right,

820
00:45:33,931 --> 00:45:36,660
so let's back up a little bit cause
you just mentioned immigration but we

821
00:45:36,661 --> 00:45:37,740
started there before.
Yeah.

822
00:45:38,130 --> 00:45:43,130
So lay out what a sensible
immigration plan actually looks like.

823
00:45:44,190 --> 00:45:49,190
I think that if you have a plausible
graduate degree from a real institution,

824
00:45:50,190 --> 00:45:54,330
including from most other nations, you
should be able to get a green card here.

825
00:45:54,810 --> 00:45:57,690
I think we should have completely
free immigration from Canada.

826
00:45:58,170 --> 00:46:02,130
I would say we should have open borders
with any country that has a more

827
00:46:02,131 --> 00:46:05,910
generous welfare state than we do because
then those people will not be coming

828
00:46:05,911 --> 00:46:06,451
for welfare.

829
00:46:06,451 --> 00:46:10,110
They'll be coming here to work and I
get you need to transition to that over

830
00:46:10,111 --> 00:46:14,160
time. And then I would still let
in people from poorer countries,

831
00:46:14,670 --> 00:46:16,860
you need some of what is
called unskilled labor.

832
00:46:16,861 --> 00:46:20,940
It's not actually unskilled in fact,
but the more skilled people you have,

833
00:46:20,941 --> 00:46:24,090
they need to work with people who
can ease the burden of their time.

834
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:28,590
So you have working women and they
want nannies or a, that's fine.

835
00:46:28,591 --> 00:46:32,880
So I think we could increase both
skilled and unskilled immigration in this

836
00:46:32,881 --> 00:46:33,714
country.

837
00:46:33,870 --> 00:46:38,040
We've done a pretty good job
of assimilating immigrants
better than anyone in

838
00:46:38,041 --> 00:46:41,550
the history of the world, I would argue.
Absolutely. So anyone that's even close,

839
00:46:41,551 --> 00:46:42,240
I mean I guess,

840
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:46,200
I guess Canada perhaps or they do
a good job accepting immigrants,

841
00:46:46,201 --> 00:46:50,500
but they assimilate the much less. So they
have a tradition like friend, you know,

842
00:46:50,550 --> 00:46:53,820
Quebec is separate and maybe
always will be separate.

843
00:46:53,970 --> 00:46:57,540
So they just let it be separate.
So if you're a Sikh Chinese,

844
00:46:57,541 --> 00:47:00,090
he moved to Canada and maybe you'll
stay separated. It works well.

845
00:47:00,091 --> 00:47:03,150
It's very peaceful. Uh, but
they assimilate much less.

846
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:07,200
I actually prefer a simulation, but
that's okay. So what do we do with the,

847
00:47:07,201 --> 00:47:07,831
what do they always say?

848
00:47:07,831 --> 00:47:10,680
It's 12 million people that are
here illegally right now. How do we,

849
00:47:10,681 --> 00:47:12,990
how do we fix this?
Then I would cut a deal.

850
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:16,650
I think they should be
able to stay and uh,

851
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:20,790
if the restriction is, you
know, want more wall for that,

852
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:24,480
it's actually a deal I would do. I'm
opposed to the wall. But you know,

853
00:47:24,481 --> 00:47:27,090
the wall will not stop people.

854
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:29,740
Most people who come come
by overstaying their visas.

855
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:35,110
The net flow from Mexico has actually
been negative by a small amount for a few

856
00:47:35,110 --> 00:47:37,720
years.
I think Central America is a problem.

857
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:42,190
The notion that you can be safe from
Honduras and simply by virtue of the fact

858
00:47:42,191 --> 00:47:46,270
that you made it to the border claim
refugee status because you know there's a

859
00:47:46,271 --> 00:47:49,570
drug gang in Europe.
Weblo I think that's a bad system.

860
00:47:49,571 --> 00:47:51,970
I do favor some version of refugee status.

861
00:47:51,971 --> 00:47:55,150
My wife was a refugee from Soviet Union,
so I appreciate this,

862
00:47:56,110 --> 00:47:58,630
but just because you know,
things are bad in my country,

863
00:47:58,631 --> 00:48:02,290
I'm a refugee because I'm close to
the U S and I made it to the border.

864
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:04,390
I think it's a very bad system.

865
00:48:04,391 --> 00:48:07,750
It's very bad incentives and it's
overwhelming our court system.

866
00:48:07,751 --> 00:48:10,750
So some of what Trump says
about that is true. Again,

867
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:14,890
my goal is to find a way of taking more
of those people in an orderly manner,

868
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:19,750
but to encourage just rushing for the
border. I do think we need to change that.

869
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:23,350
Yeah, well that's why it really does seem
we've imaginating Hillary now, right?

870
00:48:23,351 --> 00:48:25,180
You've got Trump wanting,
okay,

871
00:48:25,181 --> 00:48:28,940
he wants a wall and I don't think a wall
is actually pretty much agree with it.

872
00:48:28,941 --> 00:48:30,820
He said, I don't think a wall is
inherently racist. They may not.

873
00:48:30,821 --> 00:48:33,940
Actually work and maybe there's all
sorts of other ways to deal with it. Uh,

874
00:48:34,010 --> 00:48:35,140
but if the option that,

875
00:48:35,141 --> 00:48:37,960
if the other option that people see is
that you've got people screaming for open

876
00:48:37,961 --> 00:48:41,230
borders and I don't blame all the
people that weren't the bowl, the wall,

877
00:48:41,231 --> 00:48:42,520
and we have a wall right now.

878
00:48:42,790 --> 00:48:45,720
And if that's the way the argument's
going to be framed, right? Yeah.

879
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:48,820
So to enforce immigration more properly,

880
00:48:48,821 --> 00:48:52,180
but letting many more people
would be my preferred solution.

881
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:54,220
So when you say cut a
deal on the people here,

882
00:48:54,221 --> 00:48:56,800
so if let's say you're
throwing the Republicans,

883
00:48:57,190 --> 00:48:59,950
the idea that you're going to get some
more of a wall or something, what's the,

884
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:02,080
what's the deal on the other side of that?
What these people,

885
00:49:02,110 --> 00:49:07,060
the dreamers get to stay and we adjust
the quotas upward and say tech companies

886
00:49:07,061 --> 00:49:11,920
can hire more skilled people on work
visas. And uh, we also Redo Nafta.

887
00:49:11,921 --> 00:49:14,350
So Canadians have the
right to simply come here.

888
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:18,070
You might want to limit their ability
to claim welfare. I'm fine with that.

889
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:19,300
And over time,

890
00:49:19,301 --> 00:49:23,380
think about with what other countries
can we have free movement the European

891
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:26,620
Union has does this,
has done this within the European Union.

892
00:49:26,620 --> 00:49:28,540
I get that there's a political backlash.

893
00:49:28,810 --> 00:49:32,050
I'm not sure we should have open
borders with Bulgaria and Romania.

894
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:36,910
I understand that probably doesn't work.
We've also got, you know, an ocean. Sure.

895
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:40,870
But to the idea that 15 years from now
we could have opened borders with France

896
00:49:40,871 --> 00:49:45,040
and Germany. To me, we should be working
toward that. I understand it's not easy.

897
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:48,070
So I think when people hear
the phrase open borders,

898
00:49:48,071 --> 00:49:51,550
they think that means that
you can automatically come
here and become a citizen.

899
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:55,960
But that's not, that's not what you'd be
calling for. Right. Well, work rights,

900
00:49:55,961 --> 00:49:58,870
but we have a rapid path to citizenship,
which I favor.

901
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:03,010
It's one of the things that makes us
good at assimilation and you know,

902
00:50:03,011 --> 00:50:06,750
both political parties at different
points in the past, they always go crazy.

903
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:08,110
Like, oh, all these
people are going to come.

904
00:50:08,111 --> 00:50:09,490
They're gonna vote for the other party.

905
00:50:09,970 --> 00:50:14,970
I don't think we really know 20 years
from now what immigrants are going to vote

906
00:50:15,251 --> 00:50:18,340
for or why. So you know,
Asian Americans will,

907
00:50:18,341 --> 00:50:21,130
they remain as heavily
democratic as they are right now.

908
00:50:21,131 --> 00:50:25,120
I don't know that that one's gotta be
changing. Just the pure economics of it.

909
00:50:25,210 --> 00:50:27,950
Same with Latino's.
I just say it's an open question.

910
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:33,460
So the partisan fear that like they
who come will be on the other side.

911
00:50:33,591 --> 00:50:36,140
I think we just need to
relax a bit on that. Yeah.

912
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:40,430
Are there any topics that you shy away
from talking about because you have to

913
00:50:40,431 --> 00:50:43,210
keep on asking, keep on asking
you because I've got a whole lot,

914
00:50:43,220 --> 00:50:45,590
I haven't even looked at this, but I've
got a whole lot here about economics.

915
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:50,210
But it seems very obvious to me that
through an economic lens of looking at

916
00:50:50,211 --> 00:50:53,360
things the way you do that you
really could talk about anything.

917
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:55,880
But also I interviewed
people a lot as you do.

918
00:50:56,330 --> 00:50:58,600
And I'm used to talking about many topics,
so,

919
00:50:58,601 --> 00:51:02,450
so what else is interesting to you right
now that that maybe isn't purely within

920
00:51:02,510 --> 00:51:04,410
an economic lens or even a Political Lens?

921
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:07,220
What sort of peaking your interest
in these days besides Fords?

922
00:51:07,460 --> 00:51:10,130
The question of how to find
more talent in the world.

923
00:51:10,490 --> 00:51:15,350
So I think there's a relative surfy of
capital relative to talented labors.

924
00:51:15,830 --> 00:51:19,460
My view of the world as if you have an
incredibly talented person who is good at

925
00:51:19,461 --> 00:51:24,050
execution, that person
can get so much done. Uh,

926
00:51:24,110 --> 00:51:27,530
the world as a whole is under
explored from this point of view.

927
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:31,760
So you go to Nigeria, how many
talented people are there? Well,

928
00:51:31,761 --> 00:51:33,890
there are bad as talented
as United States,

929
00:51:33,891 --> 00:51:35,390
they just don't have the opportunities.

930
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:39,550
Look at how much talent has come from
India in the last 20 years. Right? China,

931
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:42,470
phenomenal amount.
And so 40 50 years,

932
00:51:42,770 --> 00:51:46,580
people like that didn't really
have a chance. Yeah. So how is it,

933
00:51:46,581 --> 00:51:50,960
say you were to go to Nigeria and try
to mobilize and Nigeria and talent,

934
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:53,030
what should you look for?
What should you do?

935
00:51:53,210 --> 00:51:56,810
What kind of cultural training is needed?
What ought to change in Nigeria?

936
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:58,520
How can we recruit that talent?

937
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:01,670
That's maybe the biggest
question in the world today.

938
00:52:01,671 --> 00:52:04,880
And we're not good at it and we
don't really know what we're doing.

939
00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:08,120
So I think what's keeping the twinkle
in your eye actually is the fact that

940
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:12,750
technology has led us to be able to ex
explore all of these ideas, right? Yeah,

941
00:52:12,770 --> 00:52:17,630
absolutely. Yeah. And talk to people about
them. Yeah, that's pretty cool. It is.

942
00:52:17,780 --> 00:52:18,320
Yeah.

943
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:21,780
I guess we are doing something fun and
these other countries there except maybe

944
00:52:21,781 --> 00:52:24,350
in North Korea, but they're
connected to the Internet. Yeah.

945
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:29,510
So you go to a random place in Africa or,
I was just in rural real Ecuador.

946
00:52:30,050 --> 00:52:34,340
A guy was driving me around and I
asked him, do you listen to Youtube?

947
00:52:34,890 --> 00:52:39,260
Is that cash? Was speaking fellow.
I asked him in Spanish. He's like,

948
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:42,150
of course. Uh, I went to, uh,

949
00:52:42,230 --> 00:52:46,670
my Ethiopian travel guide and Lali Bella.
I asked him, do you listen to Youtube?

950
00:52:46,671 --> 00:52:49,610
He's like, of course. I say,
what do you listened to? He said,

951
00:52:49,611 --> 00:52:54,560
I'm a big fan of Armenian church history
and he can speak articulately about

952
00:52:54,561 --> 00:52:57,500
movements in the Armenian
Christian Church in Medieval Times.

953
00:52:57,790 --> 00:53:01,700
Cause that's what he does on Youtube.
A guy in rural Ethiopia.

954
00:53:02,330 --> 00:53:06,740
That's phenomenal. People don't get how
much of that is there? What a difference.

955
00:53:06,741 --> 00:53:11,600
It's gonna make people a lot of outside.
Oh, youtube. That's like cat videos.

956
00:53:11,601 --> 00:53:13,670
Well, yes, there's those two.
Some are pretty good actually,

957
00:53:14,780 --> 00:53:18,980
but it's also a medieval Armenian church
history in, in rural Ethiopia. Yeah.

958
00:53:19,270 --> 00:53:22,730
I like how can you not be excited by that
and just the amount of people that are

959
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:26,930
thirsty for a little of this
betrayed a little bit. Yeah,

960
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:28,140
pretty great.

961
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:32,970
And they're basically all smarter than
the mainstream used to think and the

962
00:53:32,971 --> 00:53:37,110
innovators who just talk to them and
try to be like as smart as they can be,

963
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:40,560
they're attracting those audiences.
My goodness. That's exciting. Yeah.

964
00:53:40,710 --> 00:53:44,190
I don't know how to end an interview
better than that with a little excitement.

965
00:53:44,191 --> 00:53:46,740
That's pretty good. It is.
You feel good about it. I do.

966
00:53:46,770 --> 00:53:49,710
How'd I do as an interviewer?
Wonderful. You did find as a guest,

967
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:52,440
thank you very much for more on Tyler.
