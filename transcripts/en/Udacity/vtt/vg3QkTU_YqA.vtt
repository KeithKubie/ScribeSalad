00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Now, we're going to learn how to specify important parts of HTML and JavaScript,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and, in an incredible surprise move, we're going to do this specification

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
using regular expressions.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Just a quick reminder, an outline of the overall project,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:24.000
we want to start with a web page and then break it down into important words.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Maybe the less than and the greater than sign used for the tag are important words,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
the 1, the plus, and the 2, but we're largely ignoring this sort of white space

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
or these new line characters.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Then we want to take those words and diagram them into this cool tree-like structure.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Of course, this tree is growing upside down, but that won't be a problem at all.

00:00:44.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Finally, we're going to interpret that tree to figure out what it means to get the result.
