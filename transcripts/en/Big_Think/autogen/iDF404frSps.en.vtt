bye

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:03.730
 
 

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:08.690
 
you

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700
 
 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.270
 
what you see when you go gene by gene is

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:12.280
what you see when you go gene by gene is
 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.490
what you see when you go gene by gene is
that even for the ones that are

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:14.500
that even for the ones that are
 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.070
that even for the ones that are
ultimately of avian or human origin

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:17.080
ultimately of avian or human origin
 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.760

they've traveled through pigs and in
 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.470
they've traveled through pigs and in
each case we find that there's been a

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480
each case we find that there's been a
 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.540
each case we find that there's been a
timeline of about ten years where this

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:27.550
timeline of about ten years where this
 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.330
timeline of about ten years where this
virus has been in pigs but gone totally

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:30.340
virus has been in pigs but gone totally
 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.339
virus has been in pigs but gone totally
unnoticed which says something about our

00:00:32.339 --> 00:00:32.349
unnoticed which says something about our
 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:36.959
unnoticed which says something about our
surveillance and for the human outbreak

00:00:36.959 --> 00:00:36.969
surveillance and for the human outbreak
 

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:41.840
surveillance and for the human outbreak
what you see is a timeline of about

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850
what you see is a timeline of about
 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.060
what you see is a timeline of about
somewhere around October to december of

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.070
somewhere around October to december of
 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.509
somewhere around October to december of
last year that the virus was probably in

00:00:48.509 --> 00:00:48.519
last year that the virus was probably in
 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:50.189
last year that the virus was probably in
humans so it took several months to

00:00:50.189 --> 00:00:50.199
humans so it took several months to
 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:53.009
humans so it took several months to
actually spread to the point where the

00:00:53.009 --> 00:00:53.019
actually spread to the point where the
 

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:57.059
actually spread to the point where the
tip of the iceberg became apparent to us
