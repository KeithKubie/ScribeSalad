00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.133
 and Versailles. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
 spread. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.933
 intellectual point of view. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
 revolution. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.133
 Luis XVI, the king of Frances. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.600
 part of this conflict. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.400
 they are not happy. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
 other. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.800
 In this video we will talk about the French revolution. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.133
 And that makes that meaningful 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.333
 is this independence from an empire controlled by the monarchy, 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800
 as in American independence, this is one 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.933
 the perversion of monarchy. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.066
 A monarch that controls a great world power. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.533
 Depending on the cusp, the American revolution came 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.666
 the first and in a way established the principles of self-governance 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.666
 and the king's reasons. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.533
 But the French revolution marked the first time that these species 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.533
 Principles were distinguished in Europe and perverted to the truth 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
 a monarchy. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.866
 How to understand the type of environment in which it is 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.733
 began, then talk about Francis of 1789. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200
 Which most people consider as the beginning of 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 Pike first, France was poor. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.333
 Now, it is difficult to think that France was poor, if you look 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.266
 If you look at Luis XVI and the clothes that were left behind. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.933
 If you look at Maria-Antuaneten, his wife, 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.666
 they did not seem poor. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.933
 They lived in the palace of 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.933
 Versailles, which is giant. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.933
 It is this grand palace, which can be compared to palaces 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.266
 world's greatest. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.200
 They had a luxurious lifestyle. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 If you want to know its location, it is now 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.733
 almost one ... of Paris. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.066
 But at that time it was a village that was 20-30 kilometers 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.200
 away from Paris. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.866
 So they did not look poor. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.866
 But Frances's current government is poor. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 The poorest I mean are debt. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 Just had two important military adventures. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.266
 One was the American revolution. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.866
 They play an important role in supporting 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.133
 revolucionarve. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.933
 Because they wanted to oppose their enemy, 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.066
 Great Britain. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.266
 They wanted their empires to diminish somewhat. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.133
 So France sent military assistance and sufficient resources. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.333
 And as you can imagine, this is not a bunch, especially because 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 is on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.800
 Even before the American Revolution, the seven-year war 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.133
 which ended in 1763, wiped out 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.933
 the wealth that the French government had. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.866
 And for those who are more involved in American history, 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.666
 the seven-year war is in reality the same as the war between Frances 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
 and Indies. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.733
 The struggle between Frances and India was the North American theater 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.600
 of the seven-year war. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 But the seven-year war is the term with the general. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.933
 Because at the same time there was a conflict that took place in Europe. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
 The Franco-Indian War was just one 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.866
 And the seven-year war really spurred most of the powers 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.600
 European at that time. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.533
 France therefore participated in this, ended in 1763, then went on 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.733
 the American revolution. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.133
 These both exhausted the funds 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
 government. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.066
 At the same time, the French are suffering from starvation. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800
 There was a general famine at that time. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.066
 No seeds were produced so nobody could do it 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
 to eat bread. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800
 As you can see, when people are starving 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.466
 And as they add to their suffering, they could see 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.266
 the royal family who lived well. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.266
 But, and worse, the royal family, whom they saw 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.066
 every day they saw the noble. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.533
 Which contains more or less 1.5% of the population. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
 And they could see the nobleman who lived very, very well. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.933
 And the nobles, as they knew, consist of those people who 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.933
 inherit titles, land and wealth from one generation to us 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.866
 They do not wear too much of the kingdom. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.666
 And live especially in smaller versions of the palace 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.600
 And in case you are a peasant, then you work their land, everything 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600
 work, it takes you some of your crops 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.133
 and they do not even pay taxa. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 Then from your point of view, which is not difficult 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.466
 to understand, these are especially 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800
 some parasites that completely ignore it 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.733
 urine tents and the fact 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800
 that you are paying taxa. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.533
 As you may recall, people were not very happy with this situation. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800
 And above all, it was and 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.666
 the presence of all these philosophers 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.533
 Enlightenment around. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.666
 And in this kind of situation, people, 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.733
 the authors, the poets, and the philosophers, leave to 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.333
 think that perhaps the kingdom is not necessary. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.466
 Probably do not need priests to tell us what it is 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
 good or bad. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.933
 Perhaps people could govern 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.333
 surprise yourself. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
 And of course, the greatest proof of the Enlightenment was 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.466
 American Revolution. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.133
 This was the first case of revolting humanity 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 and says the kingdom is not needed with me. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.866
 We want to rule ourselves. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.266
 For the people, from the people. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.133
 So this philosophical movement 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.733
 Now, in my opinion, the greatest reason 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 I believe it was hunger, you can never underestimate 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.866
 the power of people suffering from urine. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
 And it is 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.466
 People said, here is Enlightenment. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.133
 Then this is the French state. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 They had a financial crisis. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.733
 So there was a meeting, and types of emergency meeting 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.266
 of the most important groups in France to solve 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.666
 some problems. It's a tax crisis, people are starving 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.266
 what can be done?
