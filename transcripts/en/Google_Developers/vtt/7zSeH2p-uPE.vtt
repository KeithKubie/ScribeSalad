00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.490
&gt;&gt; Hi, I'm here today at Google I/O with Jay.
Jay do mind introducing yourself and talking

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:14.080
about Apptio.
&gt;&gt; GINDIN: I am Jay Gindin, lead UI developer

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:21.329
for Apptio. We do cost transparency for IT
departments in particular, trying to help

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:27.309
them understand where is the money going,
how much is it actually costing them to provide

00:00:27.309 --> 00:00:34.590
all the different service that they're providing
and how much it cost for each of the business

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.550
units that is consuming those services to
actually use those services.

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:45.710
&gt;&gt; Okay. Now, I understand you use Google
Web Toolkit or GWT to build your product.

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.600
Can you tell us a little bit what led you
to use GWT and why it's beneficial to you?

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:55.220
&gt;&gt; GINDIN: So when the company was started
a year and a half ago, there was an evaluation

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:03.000
to try and figure out how can we get a rich
user experience, but preferably, without a

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.930
lot of plug-ins. We wanted an application
that our users would be able to just fire

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:16.810
up with their browser and start using. We
used applets in the past and also for a enterprise

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:23.140
application and ran into lots of different
problems with corporate lockdown on desktops.

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:30.360
So a web-based application was where we wanted
to go. GWT really gives us kind of the best

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.760
of both worlds because we get to write the
code in Java and we get to use the best of

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:41.979
breed tools leveraging, refactoring, and profiling,
all sorts of, all the great stuff that GWT

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:48.670
gives us. And we know how to write Java, that's
what we've been doing for many years. So we

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.320
get to take that expertise and apply it.
&gt;&gt; Sure. So you mentioned a number of developer

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.210
benefits. Obviously, there is a user benefit.
Can you talk a little bit more about developer

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:03.439
productivity? What is it about GWT that makes
you productive and lets you get on with building

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:07.600
your applications?
&gt;&gt; GINDIN: The tooling. I've been an InteleGate

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:13.920
user forever, not forever, for a long time
and it works. All right. I have all--I have

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:21.080
the access to all the refactorings, the quick
drill downs and information. We have integration

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:29.849
with the Java-based back-in that we're running
really, really easily. And probably the best

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:35.280
thing is the ease of debugging. I can set
a break point as I'm running my code and just

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.540
step through it and understand what's happening.
If it was plain old JavaScript and I was reduced

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:47.760
to using the, in comparison, very basic and
unsophisticated tools, I wouldn't be doing

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.290
it.
&gt;&gt; Okay. How about--can you maybe tell us

00:02:53.290 --> 00:03:00.349
your--your top three favorite features or
widgets or components to GWT that you like

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:05.319
and would like to talk about.
&gt;&gt; GINDIN: To--I think, one of the best things

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:09.830
is just being able to--I'm a Swing developer
and of past life and just being able to come

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:16.340
on board and use widgets that are different
but quite similar to what I'd been--what I

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:21.310
had been using for a number of years prior
with an event model that's--that was quick

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:29.590
and easy to get--ramped up on and understand
and use. In terms of particular widgets, it's

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:35.720
hard to say, they all have, I think, it's
like any library in the world, there's pluses

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:41.470
and minuses to everything. We've wound writing
some of our widgets. But one of the great

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.680
things about the widgets that are out of the
box is the ability for us to style them the

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.080
way that we want to style them to fit in with
the rest of our application.

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:56.300
&gt;&gt; Okay. You said you wrote some of your own
widgets, can you talk about one of them that

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.239
you're particularly happy with.
&gt;&gt; GINDIN: Well, we've done a few different

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:03.000
things. One of them that we wound up having
to do, although we didn't really want to is

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.360
just a button. We found that the way that
the buttons were rendered from browser to

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.030
browser, operating system to operating system
was somewhat inconsistent...

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.239
&gt;&gt; Sure.
&gt;&gt; GINDIN: Especially when you go and set

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:21.059
a button to be disabled. In particular, in
IE, the button might look okay, not great,

00:04:21.059 --> 00:04:27.330
but okay, but when you set it to be disabled,
then it becomes this really ugly block. So

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:34.419
we went and wrote our own button widget to
look good across platforms. We wrote--once

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:38.949
we had that, we put a little button bar around
it so that we would just be able to use it,

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:44.419
for example, a safe cancel or an okay cancel
or a yes-no button bar and we could have that

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:49.919
laid out just right everywhere. If one of
our non-UI developers has to come in and do

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:54.430
something, they know they can just grab one
of these and it'll lay out right.

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:58.479
&gt;&gt; Okay. Well, that's great. Well, thank you
for coming in and talking to us today.

00:04:58.479 --> 00:04:59.219
&gt;&gt; GINDIN: You bet, anytime.
&gt;&gt; All right.
