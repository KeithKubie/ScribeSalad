00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.310
 

00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:02.240
Let's face it--

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:04.970
life is uncertain.

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:06.880
But one thing is certain--

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:10.530
we need a way to make
predictions and make decisions

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.050
under uncertainty.

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:13.770
Probabilistic models can
help you to answer

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:15.040
questions such as--

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.450
What are the odds that there
will be a long line at the

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:19.720
supermarket checkout counter?

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.250
How likely is it that my
GPS device is off by

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:23.610
more than 10 meters?

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:26.920
What are the odds that I will
have a car accident next year?

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.310
How likely is it that the air
traffic control radar will

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.189
miss the approaching plane?

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.240
Should I invest in the stock
market now, or wait?

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.580
Can I use a probabilistic model
of social networking

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.190
data to create a marketing
campaign?

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.270
How do we use a statistical
model to decide if a medical

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:45.130
treatment is effective?

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:47.610
How do I model the huge amounts
of data that are now

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.170
becoming available in so
many different fields--

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.490
Big Data, as they call it--
and extract useful

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.110
information?

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:55.590
I am John Tsitsiklis--

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.650
And I'm Patrick Jaillet.

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.780
Our mission in this class is to
give you the tools to model

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.140
and analyze uncertain
situations, no matter what

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.290
your discipline.

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.200
To do that, we will use the
language and precision of

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.120
mathematics.

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.180
But we will also build
your intuition.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.210
This is an ambitious class.

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.580
The online version is at the
same level as the one offered

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.240
to MIT students.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.550
It covers a lot of material.

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.310
Beyond the basics, you will
learn about random processes

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.230
and about extracting information
from data.

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:30.230
In the end, you will be able to
make much better sense of

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:32.120
the uncertainty around you.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.626
The rewards are certain
to come.

00:01:34.626 --> 00:01:58.440
 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:59.600
Let's face it--

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:00.850
life is uncertain.

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.388
