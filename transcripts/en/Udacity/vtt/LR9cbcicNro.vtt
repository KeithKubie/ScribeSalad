Thanks, Dan. As mentioned earlier, 
we'll be using Android Studio

00:00:03.569 --> 00:00:06.602
throughout this course. 
It's an IntelliJ -based IDE

00:00:06.602 --> 00:00:10.108
that is optimized specifically 
for Android development.

00:00:10.108 --> 00:00:12.491
It's still in beta development, 
so your version may look

00:00:12.491 --> 00:00:14.701
slightly different, but that's okay.

00:00:14.701 --> 00:00:17.276
The core functionality should 
still be the same.

00:00:17.276 --> 00:00:19.876
If you haven't installed it yet, 
take a moment to do that now

00:00:19.876 --> 00:00:22.989
using the detailed instructions 
provided in the link below.

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:25.433
You'll also need to install 
the support library

00:00:25.433 --> 00:00:28.592
and that's also included 
in the instructions.

00:00:28.592 --> 00:00:30.904
Note that the SDK 
is included automatically,

00:00:30.904 --> 00:00:33.831
so you don't need 
to install that separately.

00:00:33.831 --> 00:00:35.847
If you're having difficulties, 
no worries at all.

00:00:35.847 --> 00:00:38.033
We totally understand
because it can be tricky

00:00:38.033 --> 00:00:40.469
to get everything set up properly.

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.177
You can search online for people 
who have a similar issue,

00:00:43.177 --> 00:00:46.294
or there's a troubleshooting link 
included below.

00:00:46.294 --> 00:00:48.089
If you still need help, 
you can ask a question

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:51.532
in our discussion forum as well. 
Once you install it, open it

00:00:51.532 --> 00:00:54.484
and you can check for updates 
before proceeding.

00:00:54.484 --> 00:00:56.025
Check this box when you're done.
