about wine grapes I just started my lab
 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:11.490
about wine grapes I just started my lab
a little over a year ago something to

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:11.500

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:18.540
what we study what we're trying to
actually understand and then how wine

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:18.550
actually understand and then how wine
 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:19.919
actually understand and then how wine

really of a two degree warming event
 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.120
really of a two degree warming event
across the terrestrial system which

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130
across the terrestrial system which
 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.190
across the terrestrial system which
really is where most of our crops are so

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200
really is where most of our crops are so
 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.169

this is a radical warming event I'm a

00:01:10.169 --> 00:01:10.179
this is a radical warming event I'm a
 

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:12.359
this is a radical warming event I'm a
community ecologist I am broadly trying

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:12.369
community ecologist I am broadly trying
 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:14.399
community ecologist I am broadly trying
to answer the question of how will plant

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:14.409
to answer the question of how will plant
 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:17.099
to answer the question of how will plant
species respond to such radical changes

00:01:17.099 --> 00:01:17.109
species respond to such radical changes
 

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:19.349
species respond to such radical changes
in warming that we are creating for them

00:01:19.349 --> 00:01:19.359
in warming that we are creating for them
 

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:21.330
in warming that we are creating for them
we know there are two major things that

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340
we know there are two major things that
 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.370
we know there are two major things that
happen already and those are that wild

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380
happen already and those are that wild
 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.590
happen already and those are that wild
species tend to shift in space and they

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600
species tend to shift in space and they
 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.139
species tend to shift in space and they
tend to shift in time and my goal is to

00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:28.149
tend to shift in time and my goal is to
 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:30.120
tend to shift in time and my goal is to
try to better understand that with the

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130
try to better understand that with the
 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:31.739
try to better understand that with the
ultimate goal of can we predict it and

00:01:31.739 --> 00:01:31.749
ultimate goal of can we predict it and
 

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:33.239
ultimate goal of can we predict it and
is there any hope of mitigating those

00:01:33.239 --> 00:01:33.249
is there any hope of mitigating those
 

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:35.550
is there any hope of mitigating those
consequences and I funk I focused

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560
consequences and I funk I focused
 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.859
consequences and I funk I focused
primarily on changes in time and those

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:37.869
primarily on changes in time and those
 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:40.200
primarily on changes in time and those
changes in time are phenological shifts

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210
changes in time are phenological shifts
 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.020
changes in time are phenological shifts
so phonology is the timing of recurring

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030
so phonology is the timing of recurring
 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.029
so phonology is the timing of recurring
life history events the day that a bird

00:01:45.029 --> 00:01:45.039
life history events the day that a bird
 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:46.949
life history events the day that a bird
starts its migration the day that a

00:01:46.949 --> 00:01:46.959
starts its migration the day that a
 

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:48.599
starts its migration the day that a
first leaf comes out on your maple tree

00:01:48.599 --> 00:01:48.609
first leaf comes out on your maple tree
 

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:50.249
first leaf comes out on your maple tree
in your backyard the day of first flower

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:50.259
in your backyard the day of first flower
 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:53.459
in your backyard the day of first flower
it's also the timing of crop events so

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:53.469
it's also the timing of crop events so
 

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:55.649
it's also the timing of crop events so
the day that we sow seeds of wheat is a

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:55.659
the day that we sow seeds of wheat is a
 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:57.510
the day that we sow seeds of wheat is a
phenological event it has human

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520
phenological event it has human
 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.069
phenological event it has human
influences but it's predominantly a

00:01:59.069 --> 00:01:59.079
influences but it's predominantly a
 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:01.440
influences but it's predominantly a
phonology event-related very strongly to

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450
phonology event-related very strongly to
 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.139
phonology event-related very strongly to
our crop systems and to humans it's also

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:04.149
our crop systems and to humans it's also
 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:05.999
our crop systems and to humans it's also
the date of fruit maturation that's a

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:06.009
the date of fruit maturation that's a
 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:07.760
the date of fruit maturation that's a
phenological event and the date of crops

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770
phenological event and the date of crops
 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.350
phenological event and the date of crops
their date of crop harvest and so I'm

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360
their date of crop harvest and so I'm
 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.910
their date of crop harvest and so I'm
really interested in how we can leverage

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920
really interested in how we can leverage
 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.160
really interested in how we can leverage
crop systems and in particular wine

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170
crop systems and in particular wine
 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.770
crop systems and in particular wine
grapes

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780
grapes
 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.809
grapes
to answer the question of how will wild

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819
to answer the question of how will wild
 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:18.640
to answer the question of how will wild
species actually shift with climate

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650
species actually shift with climate
 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.199
species actually shift with climate
change how can we better predict that

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209
change how can we better predict that
 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:22.030
change how can we better predict that
and I'll tell you why I use wine grapes

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040
and I'll tell you why I use wine grapes
 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.520
and I'll tell you why I use wine grapes
in two parts the first part is that wine

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530
in two parts the first part is that wine
 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.800
in two parts the first part is that wine
grapes are hyper diverse and yet

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810
grapes are hyper diverse and yet
 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.140
grapes are hyper diverse and yet
genetically very narrow so all the

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150
genetically very narrow so all the
 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:30.730
genetically very narrow so all the
different wine that you drink comes from

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:30.740
different wine that you drink comes from
 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:32.800
different wine that you drink comes from
different varieties of wine grapes wine

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810
different varieties of wine grapes wine
 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.770
different varieties of wine grapes wine
grapes are a subspecies vitis vinifera

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780
grapes are a subspecies vitis vinifera
 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.449
grapes are a subspecies vitis vinifera
subspecies vinifera they are genetically

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459
subspecies vinifera they are genetically
 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:39.370
subspecies vinifera they are genetically
less diverse than even a species and

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380
less diverse than even a species and
 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.470
less diverse than even a species and
then we have varieties so Pinot Noir is

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480
then we have varieties so Pinot Noir is
 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.270
then we have varieties so Pinot Noir is
a variety of wine grape wine grape

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280
a variety of wine grape wine grape
 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.370
a variety of wine grape wine grape
cabernet sauvignon is another one so if

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380
cabernet sauvignon is another one so if
 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.170
cabernet sauvignon is another one so if
you like pinot you like one genetic

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180
you like pinot you like one genetic
 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.750
you like pinot you like one genetic
genotype basically of wine grape and if

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760
genotype basically of wine grape and if
 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.280
genotype basically of wine grape and if
you like Cabernet Sauvignon that's a

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290
you like Cabernet Sauvignon that's a
 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.250
you like Cabernet Sauvignon that's a
slightly different genetic part type of

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260
slightly different genetic part type of
 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.440
slightly different genetic part type of
wine grape and what we see is that these

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450
wine grape and what we see is that these
 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.750
wine grape and what we see is that these
are hyper diverse in their phonology so

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760
are hyper diverse in their phonology so
 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.300
are hyper diverse in their phonology so
different varieties of wine grape come

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310
different varieties of wine grape come
 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.699
different varieties of wine grape come
out at very different times of year so

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709
out at very different times of year so
 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:05.610
out at very different times of year so
these are data from winters California

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620
these are data from winters California
 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.960
these are data from winters California
where they've planted all together in a

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970
where they've planted all together in a
 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.479
where they've planted all together in a
garden about 1,500 different varieties

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489
garden about 1,500 different varieties
 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:12.070
garden about 1,500 different varieties
of wine grape there are arguably about

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080
of wine grape there are arguably about
 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.110
of wine grape there are arguably about
5,000 different varieties of wine grape

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120
5,000 different varieties of wine grape
 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.759
5,000 different varieties of wine grape
so I'm sure you've sampled only a tiny

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:15.769
so I'm sure you've sampled only a tiny
 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:17.440
so I'm sure you've sampled only a tiny
tiny fraction no matter how hard you've

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450
tiny fraction no matter how hard you've
 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.140

here on the vertical axis you can see it

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:21.769
here on the vertical axis you can see it
 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:23.530
here on the vertical axis you can see it
goes up to 600 so a lot of different

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540
goes up to 600 so a lot of different
 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.390
goes up to 600 so a lot of different
varieties represented here but what I

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400
varieties represented here but what I
 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.770

want you to take away is the variation

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780
want you to take away is the variation
 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.800

and again that's genetically very little

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780

variation and then if we look at the

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620
variation and then if we look at the

time again well over a month of
 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.910
time again well over a month of
variation so I'm interested in this

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920
variation so I'm interested in this
 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.259

shift with climate change and we tend to

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750
shift with climate change and we tend to
 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:55.690
shift with climate change and we tend to
use phenology as this major indicator

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700
use phenology as this major indicator
 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.130
use phenology as this major indicator
but we're actually seeing shifts an

00:06:20.819 --> 00:06:23.779
drivers of things we care about so early
harvests tend to be higher quality wine

00:06:23.779 --> 00:06:23.789
harvests tend to be higher quality wine
 

00:06:23.789 --> 00:06:25.550
harvests tend to be higher quality wine
it's not that every early harvest is the

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:25.560
it's not that every early harvest is the
 

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:27.649
it's not that every early harvest is the
best vintage but in general if you

00:06:27.649 --> 00:06:27.659
best vintage but in general if you
 

00:06:27.659 --> 00:06:29.149
best vintage but in general if you
harvest early it is a very good

00:06:29.149 --> 00:06:29.159
harvest early it is a very good
 

00:06:29.159 --> 00:06:31.249
harvest early it is a very good
predictor of how high quality that wine

00:06:31.249 --> 00:06:31.259
predictor of how high quality that wine
 

00:06:31.259 --> 00:06:32.990
predictor of how high quality that wine
will be and how much you will sell it

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:33.000
will be and how much you will sell it
 

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.149
will be and how much you will sell it
for per bottle in France so these are

00:06:35.149 --> 00:06:35.159
for per bottle in France so these are
 

00:06:35.159 --> 00:06:37.100
for per bottle in France so these are

divided the data in two pieces 1950 so

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:13.240
divided the data in two pieces 1950 so
 

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:15.990
divided the data in two pieces 1950 so
all the data is 1602 before 1950 on the

mean indexes so you see that the early

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:24.130
mean indexes so you see that the early
 

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:26.580
mean indexes so you see that the early
years before and after 1950 are hot

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:26.590
years before and after 1950 are hot
 

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:29.610
years before and after 1950 are hot
they're significantly hotter after 1950

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:29.620
they're significantly hotter after 1950
 

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:31.050
they're significantly hotter after 1950
because it's gotten much hotter in

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:31.060
because it's gotten much hotter in
 

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:32.970
because it's gotten much hotter in

what you see is that drought used to be

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:44.530
what you see is that drought used to be
 

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:46.650
what you see is that drought used to be
a major driver of these early harvests

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:46.660
a major driver of these early harvests
 

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:48.690
a major driver of these early harvests
and very surprisingly to us it no longer

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:48.700
and very surprisingly to us it no longer
 

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:51.540
