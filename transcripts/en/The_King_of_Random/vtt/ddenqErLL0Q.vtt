00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.320
Back when I was a kid. 
I was in boy scouts and my dad was

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.160
actually, the scout leader and went through a phase

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.540
where he was trying to teach us all the different knots 
you could tie with rope.

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.500
But he wanted to take it one step further,

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:11.840
and actually make the rope itself.

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.800
So he used this little guide book to put
together a little makeshift rope making machine.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.080
And we spent hours winding sisal like this

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.920
and turning it into long strands of rope.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.720
Now Eventually, we made so much rope

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.360
we built a horse corral and caught two
wild horses.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:26.960
But that's a different story for another day.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.800
The problem with our rope making machine is
it generally took about  4-5 different people

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:31.420
to operate it.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.180
So the purpose of this project today;

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.340
Is to see if we can make a simple machine.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.580
That will allow you to make a rope
all by yourself.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.420
Now I made a quick trip down to my local
Home Depot

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.980
and in the hardware aisle, I found almost
all of the materials were gonna need for

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:44.300
this project today.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.340
I picked up three 1/4 inch by 5 inch Eye Bolts
that come with a hex nut already on them.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.060
I got a couple different sizes of large 
Fender Washers.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.980
I got some Cut Washers, some Hex Nuts,
and I also picked up some

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:55.800
Plastic Castor Wheels as well.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.880
These are the kind of wheels you would
put on the bottom of a cabinet or a workbench

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:59.760
you would have out in the garage.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.360
But we're just using them for the wheel.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:02.700
We're gonna cut the rest of it off.

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.200
I stopped at the lumber aisle

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.380
and I got a 1 x 6 x 6 piece of common board, as well
as this 2 x 2.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.700
But these things are a bit too big to
work with as is,

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.840
so lets get busy and
cut them to size.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.920
So guys our wood is cut,
and here's what we ended up with.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.240
I took this common board and cut it to lengths
of 7 1/2 inches

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.300
I took the first piece and doubled
it over the second one

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.140
and cut them together so that
they're exactly the same width.

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.540
Then I took a piece of our 2x2 and cut it 8 1/2 inches long.

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:34.750
the board you can see it overlaps about

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.520
three inches on either side, and the

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.290
last piece of two by two is the exact

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.990
same width as the common board itself. So if

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:42.369
we put all the pieces together it should

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:46.119
look something like this.

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:47.860
So update guys, our wood is cut and it's looking good, so

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.210
the next step now is to line up our

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.060
hardware and drill some holes. So the idea

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.320
here is to take your largest fender

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.580
washers and position them on the board

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.440
forming a triangle. You want to do it in

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.360
such a way so when you add your 2x2

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.250
to the top, as well as the bottom

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:01.899
it's going to leave similar spacing at

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:03.670
the top in the bottom. I also use the

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.740
width of my bolts as a spacer to create

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.420
gaps between the washers and ensure that

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.220
they're symmetrically placed. I think this

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:10.539
is the best way to eyeball this thing

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:11.920
together without getting super technical

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.510
on the measurement. And that's looking

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.120
pretty good so let's mark the centers.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.430
Not bad. I think we got a set. Once the

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.920
centers are marked, it's time to drill some holes.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.110
Now since we have a 1/4 inch bolt,

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.940
it makes sense to use a 1/4 inch

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.260
drill bit to drill some holes in this

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:27.880
wood. We want it to be just as tight and

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.739
snug as it can be. If we're going to drill

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:31.030
these holes, we can put the two boards

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.530
together and drill the holes at the

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.090
exact same time, that way they'll line up

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.680
perfectly. And to make sure I get them

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.180
absolutely perfect I'm just going to use

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:38.410
a couple clamps to hold them in place.

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:46.400
Alright let's drill some holes.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.409
Alright sweet, so our three holes are

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:49.670
drilled, we can go ahead and undo these

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.189
clamps, and theoretically these things

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:53.659
should be lined up perfectly,

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:56.450
symmetrically. And just for reference I'm

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.790
going to mark a little arrow on here;

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.230
in case they ever get disconnected and

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.420
turned around. Putting an X on them like

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:03.500
that, they should all line up perfectly.

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.170
Alright, we have finished up pretty

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:07.609
much everything that we need to do with

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:09.470
the wood for now. So let's move on to the

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.299
next important step: making the metal

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:13.519
spinning hooks the spinning hooks are

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:14.689
going to be made out of these eyebolts.

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:16.400
If we put them in a bench vise and tug

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.140
on them slightly we can get the eye part

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.000
to open up, and form a hook that we could

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.250
put a string into later on. We also need

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:23.540
to develop a way that when we put one

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.040
into the chuck of our drill bit and pull

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.959
the trigger, it spins all three hooks

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:28.609
simultaneously. And here's what I've got

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:30.620
in mind: what if we took three plastic

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.239
wheels and use them as pulleys and

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:33.799
connect them all together with a band,

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:36.230
so that when we spun one of them, all three

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.060
of them would spin together. Let me grab

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:39.500
a hacksaw and show you what I've got in

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:45.310
mind. Grab it right there on that axle...

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.900
Freedom!

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.400
Ok so cool guys here's we got:

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.349
I used my hacksaw to cut through these

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:59.569
little pins in the caster wheels and

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:01.430
released all three of these little

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.530
plastic wheels. If you take one of your

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:04.909
largest fender washers and push it

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:05.959
against the wheel, you're going to find

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:07.549
it overhangs about a quarter of an inch.

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:09.230
That's actually really important and

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.180
you'll see why in just a second.

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:12.439
Alright, this is where it starts getting exciting

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:13.970
guys, because all of our pieces are cut,

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:15.620
all of our pieces ready, all we have to

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.479
do now is put them together.

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:18.919
Start by removing all of the hex nuts off of your

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:20.389
bolts so you just have the naked bolt by

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:21.979
itself. You're going to take the end of

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:23.509
the bolt and push it through one of the

00:04:23.509 --> 00:04:25.490
holes, all the way through, and then take

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:27.560
one of your small cut washers, and bump

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.509
that up from the inside. With the cut

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:31.099
washer in place, we want to take our hex

00:04:31.099 --> 00:04:33.169
nut and screw that on, and thread that

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:34.699
all the way down and until it's as far as

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:36.470
it can go. Then take a wrench and crank

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:43.099
it a little bit more. Beautiful, and just

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:44.419
like that we've got a bolt that's locked

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:46.370
in place but can spin freely as well.

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:47.720
And we're going to do that three more times

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:56.780
There we go our bolts are in there and

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:58.039
secured, we can go ahead and take another

00:04:58.039 --> 00:04:59.900
cut washer now and drop it on top of

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:01.550
each one of those bolts, and then it's

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:02.990
time to add our little plastic wheels.

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:04.639
There's only one problem though, these

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:05.780
little holes in the middle are a little

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:07.880
bit too small to fit over the bolts.

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.020
So we're going to need to drill them out

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.300
with a 1/4 inch bit first.

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.880
Beauteous. Alright so the holes on our

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.170
wheels are cut, what we have to do is

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:22.580
just build up the base a little bit so

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:24.440
that there's a ridge line on either side

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:25.910
of these wheels, because when we put our

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:28.040
band on, we don't want it to slip off.

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:29.480
And to do that I'm using some of these

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:31.520
fender washers as retaining walls. Now, the

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.290
problem is these fender washers have a

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:34.670
very large hole in the middle, so we need

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:36.080
to build them up with a smaller fender

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.060
washer first. Now these fender washers

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:39.320
are the only ones I could find the Home Depot,

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:40.940
it would be more ideal if you

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:42.620
could find one with a 1/4 inch hole

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:44.210
in the center. However, using what we've

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:45.920
got, we can use this wider fender washer

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:48.140
with the 1/4 inch hole, place it on

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:49.910
top of the cut washer, and then take the

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:51.410
larger fender washer and place it on

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:55.730
top. Beautiful. And once our wheel's on,

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:56.960
we're going to do the same thing in

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.330
reverse large fender washer first,

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:01.370
slightly smaller fender washer next,

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:03.680
followed by our cut washer and a nut.

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.190
Now as we start to tighten the nut, it's

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:08.450
important to make sure all our fender

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:11.000
washers are exactly in place. And once it

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.140
looks like everything's lined up in

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:13.160
place, go ahead and take a couple of

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:14.780
wrenches and crank that sucker tight,

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:16.490
because we want that wheel to be pinched

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:18.110
so tight that it will not come undone.

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:22.090
Beautiful.

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:30.550
Alright one down two to go.

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:39.140
Oh yeah, there we go guys. We got our three

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:42.380
spinners set, and all functioning fine.

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:44.990
Alright update guys the hard part is

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:46.820
over. I've got all three of our spinners

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:49.040
in place with our hook securely firmed

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:50.750
on the other side and I went ahead and

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:51.950
tested all of them and make sure they

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:54.530
all spin freely and all of them do. So

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:55.850
here's the challenge: how do we make it

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:57.530
so that when we spin one, the other two

00:06:57.530 --> 00:06:59.390
spin at the same time? There's a little

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:00.980
solution I've come up with. It's even

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:03.230
easier than you think. And this is it: an

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:05.570
old used bicycle tire tube. Now if you

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:06.440
don't have one of these lying around,

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:08.000
they're really easy to find: just go down

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.380
to any bike store. They throw these away

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:11.420
all the time. Used tire tubes: they have no

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:12.860
use for. So they'll probably give you as

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:14.900
many as you want. Take your tire tube, it

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:16.010
doesn't really matter where and just go

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:18.440
ahead and cut it right in half. That's

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:20.270
going to give you two nice, clean cuts just

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:21.950
like this. Then take the end of the tube

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:23.300
and line it up between the two washers

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:24.770
and cut off a piece that's roughly about

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:26.720
the same distance as that gap, maybe a

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:29.840
little bigger. Take that piece of inner

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:32.270
tube and flip it so that it's inside out, so

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:34.160
that the inside is now pointed outside, and

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:35.750
the thick rubbery stuff is on the inside.

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:37.010
Now we're going to stretch this a few

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:38.510
times to make a little bit bigger, and

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:39.680
then we're going to loop it over all of

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:45.860
our pulleys at once. This creates a

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:47.330
makeshift rubber belt that has quite a

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:48.680
bit of tension, but you can see how it's

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:49.970
pulling everything into the center.

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:51.770
That's where our second board comes into

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:53.720
play. Because the holes were cut exactly

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:55.100
the same, we should be able to push the

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:56.540
bolts in place, and that'll line

00:07:56.540 --> 00:08:00.380
everything up symmetrically. And now when

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:02.450
we turn one bolt, you can see the belt

00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:04.040
drives the other two pulleys, and they

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:08.960
all spin together. Sweet! So this right

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:10.280
here is the essence of our rope making

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:11.630
machine and all that's left to do is take

00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:13.880
our 2x2s and screw one block into

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:15.830
the top, and the longer block into the

00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:17.300
bottom, so it has a couple of overhanging

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:19.100
pieces that allow us to clamp this unit to

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:21.980
the table. Oh this thing is looking good!

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:25.070
Yeah! So guys, check this out. This is

00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:26.960
what we have created. A simple rope

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:28.340
making machine made with very cheap

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:29.780
materials from local hardware store.

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:31.430
What's really cool about it is it has

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:32.840
these little flanges on the side so you

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:34.610
can take a clamp and clamp it straight

00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:36.260
to your table. And believe me, that's

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:37.580
going to come in really handy as we

00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:39.560
start making rope in future videos. When

00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:40.940
it comes time to operate our machine, all

00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:41.990
we have to do is take something like a

00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:43.940
cordless power drill, latch onto one of

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:45.350
the bolts from the back and pull the

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:46.560
trigger.

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:48.630
How cool is that guys? A simple little

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:49.980
rope-making machine we just built here

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:51.540
at home, but the problem is, it's still

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:53.010
going to take three to five people to

00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:54.930
help make the rope. In the next video, I'm

00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:56.010
going to show you how to rig up the rest

00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:58.230
of the system to automate the process, so

00:08:58.230 --> 00:08:59.880
with the press of the trigger, one person

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:01.080
can make a strand of rope, all by

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:02.790
themselves. So there you have it guys.

00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:03.990
With just a little bit of effort and

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:05.220
some low cost materials from the

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:06.930
hardware store, we just rigged ourselves

00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:08.130
up a pretty cool little rope making

00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:09.900
machine. And I can't wait to show you in

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:11.820
a future video exactly what it will do.

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:13.680
Thanks for joining me for this project,

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:14.910
I'll be looking for you the next one.

00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:19.410
Beautiful! Oh you got to be

00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:23.600
kidding me! When all your work goes down the drain.
