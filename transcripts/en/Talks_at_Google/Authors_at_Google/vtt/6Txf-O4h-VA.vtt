00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:05.399
&gt;&gt;Adam: Hello and welcome to Authors@Google
New York. My name is Adam Ingrassia and I'm

00:00:05.399 --> 00:00:12.190
here to introduce Paul Ingrassia, my dad,
who is an automobile industry journalist with

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:17.340
25, going on what, 30 years of experience
in the field. He won a Pulitzer Prize for

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:26.280
his coverage of the GM situation in 1993.
"Situation." And won the Gerald Loeb Award

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:34.280
at the time. He's a regular contributor to
"The Wall Street Journal," to MSNBC--CNBC--and

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.640
has appeared recently on "Meet the Press,"
"The Daily Show" and other fun outlets, now

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.740
including Google's Authors in New York. So,
with that, Paul Ingrassia.

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:45.740
[applause]

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:54.719
&gt;&gt;Paul: Oh, well thank you, Adam, for that
kind introduction and thanks to all you for

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.450
a chance to be here at Google, especially
because I'm a shareholder, so I want to speak

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:06.850
quickly and get you guys back to work as soon
as possible. The, just a little market test

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.490
here, since Adam mentioned "Meet the Press"
and "The Daily Show," how many people here

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:19.180
watch "Meet the Press"? How many watch "The
Daily Show"? Well, that's sort of interesting.

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:25.150
OK. Yeah. Good. Adam was kind enough to mention
the Pulitzer Prize that I won back in 1993

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.560
when I worked for the "Wall Street Journal."
What he didn't tell you is that one his younger

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:35.090
brothers went to junior high then; went to
school the next day and told his teacher his

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:42.900
dad had just won the Pulitzer Surprise, so
what can I say? He added about [inaudible].

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:51.009
In thinking about how to address a Google
audience about my book, which is called "Crash

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:56.770
Course: The American Automobile Industry's
Road from Glory to Disaster," which was published

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:02.290
by Random House in January, I thought this
was sort of interesting because you guys are

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:12.599
the ultimate, or the prototypical, new economy
company, right? And Detroit, Ford, General

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:18.209
Motors and Chrysler are the prototypical old
economy companies, but when you think about

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:24.609
it, it's really pretty interesting. For one
thing, cars today have more computers onboard;

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:30.629
each car that mainstream, that mainframe computers
had 20 years ago. And the other thing, as

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:37.379
hard as it is to believe, in the mid-20th
century, Detroit actually was America's Silicon

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:41.540
Valley; that whole area of southeastern Michigan.
Flint, Michigan, Detroit, Michigan. Flint's

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.849
about 75 miles north of Detroit, down to Toledo,
which made glass and over to Cleveland which

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:52.209
made parts and all that sort of thing. So,
it's fully been a remarkable, reversal of

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:59.969
fortune that culminated last year. When you,
this book really is built around the historic

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:06.510
events of 2008 and 2009 and just to put those
in perspective, they were remarkable events.

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.659
In the middle of September, we had the bailout
of banks at Wall Street--that's September

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:17.999
2008; couple months later we had the first
African-American President of the United States

00:03:17.999 --> 00:03:22.820
was elected, and then in the spring of 2009
we had the bankruptcies of General Motors

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:27.609
and Chrysler. So, the way I look at this is
there was one historic breakthrough, right?

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:32.819
The President Obama's election and whether
you voted for him or not, it was still a breakthrough.

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:40.459
And there were two breakdowns; really the
breakdown on Wall Street and the sad bankruptcies

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:46.949
of GM and Chrysler. To put them in perspective,
General Motors was really in the mid-20th

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:51.879
century was like Toyota, Google and Microsoft
combined. I mean, they had fundamental research

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:57.290
there that invented the artificial heart valve
and all that sort of thing. I mean, not just

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:03.750
cars, but a lot of amazing scientists did
amazing things at the GM Technical Center.

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:09.390
In 1955, GM became the first company in the
history of the planet to earn more than $1

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:14.430
billion in a single year. That doesn't sound
like much. I mean, it's probably the quarterly

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.340
earnings for you guys, OK? But it just gives
you a little perspective about the kind of

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:26.620
power these companies had. The bailout of
the banks at Wall Street cost the American

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:31.669
taxpayers about seven or eight times as much
as the bailout of Detroit. It was still about

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:37.120
$700 billion to about $100 billion, roughly
speaking, but there's a really, a complete

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:43.220
difference in how these things impacted America
emotionally. I mean, cars are really part

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:52.520
of America's psyche and America's soul. Back
in the 1940s, John Steinbeck wrote a book

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:57.540
called "Cannery Row," and he was describing
that period in the early 20th century when

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:02.520
the Model T ruled the roads and he said, "Most
babies of the period were conceived in Model

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:08.129
T Fords and not a few were actually born in
them." So after the war, after the Second

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:13.379
World War, America really changed very dramatically.
Suburbs grew up; really right here in New

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:18.680
York with Levittown, Long Island, being one
of the first. The motel industry, the national

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:24.409
motel chains were founded. The first one was
called "Holiday Inn," founded by Kemmons Wilson

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:30.219
near Memphis, Tennessee. You had an interstate
highway system and of course you had Ray Kroc,

00:05:30.219 --> 00:05:36.479
in the 1950s, bought McDonald's and built
it into a nationwide, now even a global, powerhouse.

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:40.039
So, the way I look at it in the book was social
impact of the automobile really created a

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:50.630
sort of 4H Club, if you will; housing, highways,
hamburgers and hotels. Again, banks, no one

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:56.659
ever wrote songs about banks and celebrated
them in music and movies and anything like

00:05:56.659 --> 00:06:03.530
that; quite the opposite with automobiles.
In 1963, the Beach Boys--I'm dating myself

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:09.069
here, I know--the Beach Boys had a hit song
called "Shut Down." "Shut Down" was not about

00:06:09.069 --> 00:06:16.530
a bank closing, OK? It was about, anybody
know? Anybody know? It was about a drag race.

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:21.379
When you won the drag race, you were said
to be shutting down your opponent. Three years

00:06:21.379 --> 00:06:27.729
later, Wilson Pickett sang "Mustang Sally,"
OK? It wasn't Mustang Sallie Mae, it was Mustang

00:06:27.729 --> 00:06:32.469
Sally. So, there was a real message in that
at what cars mean to us emotionally. And so,

00:06:32.469 --> 00:06:36.249
in this book I really tried to answer what
I consider to be the big questions about happened

00:06:36.249 --> 00:06:41.580
in the bailouts and bankruptcies. So, first
of all, why did Detroit almost collapse? Was

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:46.780
it inevitable? Was the bailout worth it? And
what's going to happen now to this, this industry

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:53.931
that remains an enormous industry in our country?
The reasons were simple and complex at the

00:06:53.931 --> 00:07:03.999
same time. For decades, really from the 1920s
all the way until the early, the mid-1970s,

00:07:03.999 --> 00:07:09.060
this industry was dominated by a corporate
oligopoly, which was the big three car companies

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:14.319
in Detroit: General Motors, Ford and Chrysler,
and a labor monopoly, the United Autoworkers

00:07:14.319 --> 00:07:21.029
Union. And they were two very powerful forces
and they controlled everything. The UAW organized

00:07:21.029 --> 00:07:27.849
every GM, Ford and Chrysler factory, so they
really imposed a pattern contract on, on every,

00:07:27.849 --> 00:07:32.949
each of those companies no matter which of
the companies it was. And these, these powerful

00:07:32.949 --> 00:07:38.620
corporations and this powerful union had enormous,
unchallenged power. So basically, anytime

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:44.949
that there came to be a union request for
more benefits or wages or whatever, the car

00:07:44.949 --> 00:07:49.500
companies just said, "OK, we'll give it to
'em because we can pass it through to consumers.

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:52.870
There's not really any competition here; they
gotta buy cars from us. There's nobody else

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:57.520
to buy for but, buy it from." The only other
cars you could buy really were these little,

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:02.590
weird things called Beetles, you know, Volkswagen
Beetles. And not many people bought those.

00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:09.189
So, really this enormous unchallenged concentration
of power was something that made billions

00:08:09.189 --> 00:08:14.129
of dollars for the car business over decades.
But in the process, the industry sowed the

00:08:14.129 --> 00:08:15.539
seeds of its own demise.

00:08:15.539 --> 00:08:20.090
Let me give you a brief history of the industry
because this book is two books in one. It's

00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:24.229
sort of a capsule history of the car business
and the last third of the book is a blow by

00:08:24.229 --> 00:08:30.870
blow of what happened in the White House,
in Detroit and other places that produced

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:36.919
the bailout and the bankruptcies of these
companies last year. Ford took the lead in

00:08:36.919 --> 00:08:43.419
the industry with the Model T, developed,
launched in 1908. The Model T--think of it

00:08:43.419 --> 00:08:50.320
as the first social networking device, if
you will. The, what the Model T did was, it

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:54.279
was an inexpensive and reliable car. It was
sort of the Volkswagen Beetle, if you will,

00:08:54.279 --> 00:09:03.089
of its day. The Model T Ford freed American
farmers from rural peasantry. I mean, they

00:09:03.089 --> 00:09:06.791
were isolated before then; all of a sudden
they could go into town. There's this great

00:09:06.791 --> 00:09:12.850
apocryphal story of a social researcher who
goes out to a farmhouse, an isolated farmhouse,

00:09:12.850 --> 00:09:16.029
and says to the woman who lives there, says,
"I don't get it. You don't even have indoor

00:09:16.029 --> 00:09:21.399
plumbing, but you have a Model T Ford sitting
out in front of your house. Why is that?"

00:09:21.399 --> 00:09:25.690
And she said, "It's pretty simple, buddy.
You can't go to town in a bathtub." OK? So

00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:34.410
that sort of explains the importance of this.
In the late 1920s and '30s, Alfred Sloan,

00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:39.459
the CEO of GM, came along with another idea.
He said that cars are not just for physical

00:09:39.459 --> 00:09:43.990
mobility, but for social mobility. So, in
other words, the kind of car you own is gonna

00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:48.839
be an expression of your status in life, your
status in your community. He created this

00:09:48.839 --> 00:09:54.959
hierarchy of brands: Chevrolet, Pontiac, Oldsmobile,
Buick and if you were lucky enough and wanna

00:09:54.959 --> 00:09:59.480
be in the elite few, you'd drive a Cadillac.
And that lead to the old joke about everybody's

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:03.610
last ride in life is a Cadillac because they
made hearses of Cadillacs , if you will. In

00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:10.700
the 1930s and the 1940s, the UAW organized
the industry. There was a series of violent

00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:16.360
strikes; Flint, Michigan, and Detroit. But
the UAW succeeded in organizing these companies.

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:24.410
And then came the glory years of the Corvette.
The Corvette was developed in 1953. Tail fins

00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:31.560
came along later on in that decade. Has anybody
ever seen those George Jetson tail fin cars

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:37.791
in a museum or online somewhere? I mean, they're
stunning. They're gorgeous actually. A little

00:10:37.791 --> 00:10:42.820
impractical, but they're great. The early
'60s, the Mustang came along and then muscle

00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:50.040
cars with the Pontiac GTO and you had these
crazy sort of scenes where in Chicago there

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:57.029
was an industrial park where the kids used
to gather at night and race their GTOs and

00:10:57.029 --> 00:11:03.680
their Chevy SS Super Sports and all that against
each other. And the fire department got so

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:07.500
worried about it; they decided to put an end
to it. They came in every night and they hosed

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:13.040
down the roads of this area so the kids couldn't
race, so. But it was a fascinating time. It

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:19.640
was the peak of the American Detroit automobile
industry. Then came the 1970s. Now again,

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:23.019
I'm gonna date myself here. I don't know how
many of you were around in the '70s, but the

00:11:23.019 --> 00:11:30.089
'70s were not a good date, a good decade for
America. We had defeat Vietnam, we had Watergate,

00:11:30.089 --> 00:11:38.940
we had two oil crises; 1973 and 1979. We had
bell-bottom pants. We had "The Brady Bunch,"

00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:44.490
we had Donny and Marie. I mean, all these
terrible things were going on, right? And

00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:50.490
they were not good for the auto industry,
either. In 1970, there was a landmark 67-day

00:11:50.490 --> 00:11:55.329
strike at General Motors. The outcome of that
was a 30 percent wage increase over three

00:11:55.329 --> 00:11:59.120
years. Hey, pretty good for the workers, right?
But what they really ended up doing was pricing

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:04.709
themselves out of the market. Even worse,
out of the 1970 strike came something called

00:12:04.709 --> 00:12:11.790
"30 and out retirement." Thirty and out retirement
meant this: that if you were a certain age

00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:18.750
and the first age was 58 years old, and you
had spent 30 years on the job at a car factory,

00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:22.360
you could retire with full pension benefits,
medical benefits for the rest of your life.

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:29.040
Full pension and benefits. And that was, additionally,
the minimum age was 58, but a couple years

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:34.440
later the minimum age was completely abolished,
so think about this. You started at a car

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:38.529
factory at 18; they hire you right out of
high school, you work till age 48, you have

00:12:38.529 --> 00:12:45.750
your 30 years in. If you lived until age 78,
you could collect full pension and benefits

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:50.550
for longer than you actually spent working.
And, by the way, medical advances were happening

00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:55.569
all the time, so more and more people were
living to that age. And all these obligations

00:12:55.569 --> 00:13:00.290
just grew and grew over the years. They tried
to put out some pretty shabby cars in those

00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:09.019
years; the Vega and the Gremlin and the Ford
Pinto. I mean, they're all infamous cars in

00:13:09.019 --> 00:13:14.050
the history of Detroit. And the Vega was built
in a factory in Lordstown, Ohio, where labor

00:13:14.050 --> 00:13:19.480
management relationships were so hostile that
there was actually deliberate sabotage going

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:23.149
on. One of the favorite things they would
do was the workers would, when a car came

00:13:23.149 --> 00:13:28.310
off the assembly line, they'd stick the--each
car got a key in the trunk, you got a key

00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:33.320
in the ignition and an extra key in the trunk--and
that little keyhole in the trunk, they'd snap

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:38.699
off the top of the key so you couldn't open
the trunk. I mean, it was awful. And then,

00:13:38.699 --> 00:13:43.889
of course, people got turned off by these
cars. As a result of this, the Japanese got

00:13:43.889 --> 00:13:50.740
a toehold in America with the two oil crises
in 1973 and 1979. The Japanese cars started

00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:55.060
coming in and people bought them because they
were they only fuel-efficient cars. But then,

00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:59.449
as it turned out, they liked them because
they had a lot of quality to them; they lasted.

00:13:59.449 --> 00:14:03.980
A few years later, Honda actually decided--Honda
was a pipsqueak company in Japan, like the

00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:08.810
sixth or seventh largest car company, it was
nothing--they only decided to start building

00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:13.360
vehicles here out of desperation because they
were too small to really prosper and expand

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:18.579
in Japan; it was dominated by Toyota. So they
actually started, in 1979, building motorcycles

00:14:18.579 --> 00:14:23.100
in Ohio; sort of a test case to see if they
could get along with American workers. It

00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:27.990
worked beautifully. The American workers,
properly managed, were dedicated and productive.

00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:32.889
So, a few years later they built a car factory
and in November 1982, they started building

00:14:32.889 --> 00:14:38.920
cars in America. And it was a landmark in
the history of American business and in globalization,

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:45.120
by the way, because it was the first successful
car, foreign car, built in America, was the

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:49.889
Honda Accord. A few years later, the UAW tried
to organize this Honda factory, which is in

00:14:49.889 --> 00:14:55.860
Marysville, Ohio, not far from Columbus, and
the workers voted "no." And so what happened

00:14:55.860 --> 00:15:00.470
as a result of all this. was the Big Three
Oligopoly was broken by the Japanese growing

00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:06.420
presence in America and the UAW labor monopoly
was broken because all of a sudden there was

00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:11.839
a major car factory that wasn't represented
by the UAW.

00:15:11.839 --> 00:15:17.649
So then came the '80s; sort of a decade of
repentance, renewal and relapse in Detroit.

00:15:17.649 --> 00:15:21.750
Chrysler had a brush with bankruptcy and was
bailed out by the government. That was our

00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:27.160
first government bailout, by the way. So they
launched the K-cars, a new kind of vehicle

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:33.819
called the minivan. Adam probably doesn't
remember, but we had a minivan when he was

00:15:33.819 --> 00:15:38.120
six years old and his twin brothers were four.
It was the perfect vehicle for a family with

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:42.709
three kids because the kids could sit apart.
There was a demilitarized zone between them.

00:15:42.709 --> 00:15:49.550
It was great. General Motors launched Saturn
as an attempt to reinvent itself and to really

00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:54.439
get along with labor. And if you read the
Saturn memorandum, understanding between the

00:15:54.439 --> 00:15:58.600
union and the company, it's pretty moving.
I mean, the words are up there; you can read

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:04.450
them yourself. But it was a very moving ennobling
document. The problem was, that as the decade

00:16:04.450 --> 00:16:09.190
went on and they started making really record
profits again in the '80s, they went astray

00:16:09.190 --> 00:16:15.180
again because they started diversifying; they
bought banks and savings and loans and computer

00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:18.181
companies and all this kind of stuff they
really didn't have any business being in.

00:16:18.181 --> 00:16:22.800
And they also started something called the
Jobs Bank. The Jobs Bank was something that

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:27.620
was initially had very modest goals. If you
were a worker and you were laid off because

00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:33.569
they put new robots in the plant, you would
get paid anyway for up to a year, up to a

00:16:33.569 --> 00:16:37.759
total capital of about a billion dollar outlay
by the company or something like that, to

00:16:37.759 --> 00:16:41.850
give you a chance to basically hang around
until you could get another job when it opened

00:16:41.850 --> 00:16:46.740
up when another factory opened. The problem
was, within a few years, all those rules and

00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:51.370
restrictions went away. So if you got laid
off for any reason, no matter what the reason

00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:59.279
was, the company had to pay you indefinitely
for not working, OK? We'll get back to the

00:16:59.279 --> 00:17:02.790
Jobs Bank a little bit later because it got
even worse than that. So anyway, as a result

00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:06.700
of all this, they went from record losses
in the early '80s to record profits in the

00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:11.730
early '80s, back to record losses again in
the early '90s. It was really a roller coaster

00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:12.730
ride.

00:17:12.730 --> 00:17:17.550
And then comes the '90s, OK? And they were
saved. And they were saved by something called

00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:25.380
the SUV. The SUV became very popular in the
early '90s and it was like--I'm writing a

00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:29.700
new book about cars that helped shape the
culture and the Jeep and the SUV were one

00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:36.670
of them. And the chapter that is titled, "How
to Look like You're Going Rock Climbing When

00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:41.840
You're Really Going to Nordstrom's," OK? So,
that explains the appeal of the SUV, OK? I'll

00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:46.650
just leave it at that. The Japanese, being
very logical people couldn't understand these

00:17:46.650 --> 00:17:50.830
inscrutable Westerners that would actually
buy these off-road vehicles and drive them

00:17:50.830 --> 00:17:56.440
to the shopping mall. I mean, it was kind
of nutty. At the same time, Honda had a major

00:17:56.440 --> 00:18:01.500
kickback scheme going on inside its U.S. sales
organization, where basically, if you were

00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:04.960
a dealer and you wanted an extra allocation
of cars because they couldn't produce enough

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:12.290
cars--the Americans wanted Hondas--you'd have
to pay off the guys, the Americans, in the

00:18:12.290 --> 00:18:18.070
senior sales ranks of Honda's U.S. sales operation.
In fact, the ringleader in all this was a

00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:24.400
man called Jim Cardiges and the Honda dealers
nicknamed him "Carjesus," right, because all

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:29.070
he had to do was put a few dollars into the
collection plate and miracles would happen.

00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:34.720
So basically, you this second lead, the big
three companies were having lots of troubles,

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:42.340
but the SUVs gave them a new lease on life.
Record earnings, Daimler-Benz in Germany acquired

00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:47.490
Chrysler, so all these three companies had,
in 1987, they paid $30 billion, the Germans

00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:53.670
did for Chrysler. I think 37 billion. Ford
and GM had record earnings, but at the same

00:18:53.670 --> 00:18:58.510
time this renewal of prosperity in the business
sort of led to renewed pathologies, if you

00:18:58.510 --> 00:19:04.270
will. GM and the union undermined Saturn;
each for their own reasons. The union didn't

00:19:04.270 --> 00:19:10.930
want the Saturn system in which workers were
paid according to productivity and profits

00:19:10.930 --> 00:19:16.190
and quality. They didn't want that to spread.
They just, that was heresy to the UAW orthodoxy.

00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:20.640
And GM meanwhile, didn't have enough money
to develop new cars for all this division,

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:25.800
so theybasically let Saturn go a whole decade
without getting a new product. I mean, can

00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:30.720
you imagine going a decade around here without
a new product release? Right, get it, OK,

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:33.460
it's death and that's what happened to Saturn.

00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:38.350
Then comes the new millennium. Ford returned
to red ink. There was a lot of infighting

00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:43.890
at DaimlerChrysler with two sides just clashed
over everything. One of the classics was the

00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:47.310
Germans were shocked that the Chrysler people
would have their corporate logo printed on

00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:52.620
little paper cocktail napkins and people would
wipe their mouths on these napkins and toss

00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:57.270
them in the garbage. And it was desecrating
the corporate logo. And the Chrysler people

00:19:57.270 --> 00:20:03.620
thought it was normal. I mean, all these kind
of crazy fights broke out. GM bet big on SUVs,

00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:08.010
but also they decided to diversify into a
new market around 2004. And guess what? As

00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:13.630
if on cue, it was sub-prime mortgages, right?
But still, SUVs were making lots and lots

00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:19.230
of money. The problem was is that by this
time they're cost structures were so bloated

00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:24.040
that the only vehicles they were making money
on were big pickup trucks and SUVs. They weren't

00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:28.990
making money on ordinary cars. They were like
a one-legged stool, and guess what happened?

00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:37.050
2005, Hurricane Katrina hits New Orleans and
the stool collapses. General Motors lost $10-1/2

00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:43.340
billion in 2005. Let me put that in perspective.
The U.S. economy was booming then, car sales

00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:48.900
were just shy--industry wide sales--were just
shy of an all-time record. The next year,

00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:54.660
car sales were a little softer, but not much;
still very close to an all-time record. So,

00:20:54.660 --> 00:21:01.011
Ford lost 12.6 billion. At that time, Ford
decided to make a radical course correction

00:21:01.011 --> 00:21:05.660
and they brought in a new CEO who said, "Look,
we're gonna get rid of brands we can't support.

00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:11.170
We're gonna get rid of Jaguar and Land Rover,"
which they owned. Daimler, the Germans made

00:21:11.170 --> 00:21:16.000
a radical course correction. They dumped Chrysler;
they sold it to a New York private equity

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:20.240
firm here in town called Cerberus. Out in
Detroit, they're nicknamed "clueless," OK,

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:24.500
because they had no idea what they were buying.
General Motors sadly stayed the course, though.

00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:28.740
They stuck with their CEO; they stuck with
their strategy and all that right until the

00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:31.050
bitter end. And the bitter end would be bitter,
indeed.

00:21:31.050 --> 00:21:38.140
So, here we come to 2008, the fateful year.
A landmark year in the history of the automobile

00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:42.130
business in America. I mean, someone some
years from now is gonna talk about the 100th

00:21:42.130 --> 00:21:48.390
anniversary of the founding of Google as a
landmark year. But 2008 was the 100th anniversary

00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:53.340
of both the Model T Ford and of the founding
of General Motors. But in the middle of September,

00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:58.740
Wall Street collapsed. Wall Street collapsed,
Merrill Lynch was sold, Lehman Brothers went

00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:03.100
out of business. Car sales collapsed, too.
In fact, for the first nine months of that

00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:08.550
year, car sales were running along at about
14 million annual sales pace, which is not

00:22:08.550 --> 00:22:14.800
great, but not a disaster. Right over that
weekend, car sales collapsed to a ten million

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:20.230
annual pace, which is a disaster. In fact,
no single event-not the JFK assassination,

00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:28.350
not the Gulf War, not anything else in America--has
caused such an overnight sudden collapse in

00:22:28.350 --> 00:22:35.150
automobile sales. So, the Big Three CEOs then
decided they needed money. They flew down

00:22:35.150 --> 00:22:39.960
to Washington in their corporate jets to ask
for bailouts. I mean, where were the PR guys,

00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:45.370
OK? I mean, how stupid was that? Ford reversed
course on that. They said, "Look, we borrowed

00:22:45.370 --> 00:22:49.100
enough money to get through this crisis. We're
not gonna need government money." But General

00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:52.760
Motors and Chrysler said, "We're gonna run
out of money by the end of this year without

00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:58.890
government help." Congress said, "No, we're
not gonna put money down to sinkholes." Because

00:22:58.890 --> 00:23:03.010
they, they had these hearings in front of
Congress and the whole Jobs Bank issue came

00:23:03.010 --> 00:23:08.820
up. What didn't come up was a really perverse
extension of the Jobs Bank called Inverse

00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:16.660
Layoffs. Anybody here know what an inverse
layoff is? OK, hold on to your seat for just

00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:20.580
a minute. An inverse layoff works just like
this: in an industrial setting, in a factory

00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:26.640
or something, layoffs are determined by seniority,
right? So if a layoff comes, production cut

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:32.090
comes and there's a layoff, the senior people
stay on the job and the junior people get

00:23:32.090 --> 00:23:37.480
laid off. But getting 95 percent of your pay
indefinitely in the Jobs Bank for being laid

00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:44.170
off made being laid off very attractive. So,
the union actually won the right for its senior

00:23:44.170 --> 00:23:49.700
members to bump themselves into unemployment
and bump the junior guys back onto the assembly

00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:55.580
line. I mean, this is wacko. But that's what
happens. So no wonder Congress said no. Bush

00:23:55.580 --> 00:23:59.030
knows, in the waning days in office, says,
"Look, I'm not gonna let this Detroit thing

00:23:59.030 --> 00:24:03.350
collapse on my watch." He diverted enough
money from the bank bailout to keep them in

00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:07.790
business for a couple months. Said, "I'm getting
out of Dodge. I'm handing this problem off

00:24:07.790 --> 00:24:13.480
to Barack Obama." That's what happened. Obama
comes in; February and March he formed an

00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:18.110
Automotive Task Force. Most of these people
had no experience with the automobile industry.

00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:21.970
They were private equity folks here in New
York, but that was actually turned out--frankly,

00:24:21.970 --> 00:24:26.280
I was very skeptical at the beginning. It
turned out to be a good thing, though, because

00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:30.250
these people were not captive to Detroit's
conventional wisdom. They had common sense.

00:24:30.250 --> 00:24:34.920
They saw the Jobs Bank was crazy and they
didn't have this ingrained knowledge of things

00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:42.651
we can't do. There were no sacred cows. Nothing
was untouchable. On April 1st, President Obama

00:24:42.651 --> 00:24:48.790
gave a speech and Rick Wagoner, the CEO of
General Motors, was replaced. He had been

00:24:48.790 --> 00:24:53.251
CEO since 2000 and had produced $50 or $60
billion of losses on his watch. I'm not so

00:24:53.251 --> 00:25:00.020
sure how long a CEO who did that at Google
would last, but it was a long time. It was

00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:06.250
long time for him to go, long since passed
the time for him to go. On April 30th, Chrysler

00:25:06.250 --> 00:25:10.840
filed for Chapter 11. The government brokered
a deal with Fiat would get 20 percent of it.

00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:17.120
UAW ended up owning 55 percent of the company.
Interestingly enough, by the way, the UAW

00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:22.320
didn't want to own Chrysler, control Chrysler.
They wanted to be paid in cash for the money

00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:27.290
that was owed to their retiree medical care
fund. They didn't want to be paid in Chrysler

00:25:27.290 --> 00:25:31.640
stock. I mean, they weren't nuts. They didn't
know that the stock had ended up being worth

00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:36.050
anything. They really would have rather milked
the company instead of own the company. But

00:25:36.050 --> 00:25:42.190
the government insisted on this. On June 1--there's
a typo there, I'm sorry--but on June 1st,

00:25:42.190 --> 00:25:47.330
General Motors filed for Chapter 11. Sixty-two
percent and a half percent ended up being

00:25:47.330 --> 00:25:52.451
owned by the U.S. government; another 10 to
12 percent by the Canadians. The nickname

00:25:52.451 --> 00:25:58.640
"government motors" was born. A lot of pain
in all this. Bankruptcy is an ugly thing,

00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:05.110
folks. A lot of pain in all this. Dealers
lost their franchises, workers lost their

00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:11.990
jobs, managers lost their jobs at executives,
shareholders got wiped out, bondholders took

00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:16.810
big haircuts and of course, taxpayers paid
dearly. Now some of the sacrifices might sound

00:26:16.810 --> 00:26:21.500
sort of comical, but I mean, Chrysler retiring
Vice Presidents used to get two free lease

00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:27.240
cars every year for life. That's gone, OK?
UAW members used to get free Viagra as part

00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:32.310
of their healthcare plan; that's gone, OK?
But there was a lot of real pain that went

00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:33.870
on here as a result of this.

00:26:33.870 --> 00:26:40.990
So what, so what are the myths of the bailout?
One is that Detroit was a victim of the economic

00:26:40.990 --> 00:26:46.550
collapse; just not true. I mean, how do explain
the fact that GM and Ford and Chrysler were

00:26:46.550 --> 00:26:53.360
losing billions in 2005 and 2006 when the
economy was strong? They were victims of their

00:26:53.360 --> 00:27:00.090
own mismanagement, frankly, and in this own
perverse, longstanding warfare between the

00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:04.370
union and management. It was pretty awful.
Another myth: the collapse was inevitable.

00:27:04.370 --> 00:27:09.580
Then how do you explain Ford and Ford's survival?
They were the only Detroit car company that

00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:16.950
didn't file for bankruptcy and the reason
is, beginning in 2006, they made a radical

00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:22.160
correction. They brought in a new CEO from
outside the company, Alan Mulally from Boeing,

00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:26.620
he replaced Bill Ford, Jr. I mean, Bill Ford,
the Ford family controls 40 percent of the

00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:31.650
voting stock at Ford. Bill Ford decided to
fire himself; that's what he did. And frankly,

00:27:31.650 --> 00:27:34.990
it took a lot of courage and humility for
him to do that. He's really one of the heroes

00:27:34.990 --> 00:27:39.790
of this book. When Alan Mulally came in, he
said, "We're gonna borrow everything up to

00:27:39.790 --> 00:27:44.510
the hill." They even mortgaged--you know,
the blue orange logo that Ford has--they mortgaged

00:27:44.510 --> 00:27:51.050
everything to raise money to finance a turnaround
and it's working, by the way. And they also,

00:27:51.050 --> 00:28:00.590
they didn't go out and need government money.
They sold brands they couldn't afford to support.

00:28:00.590 --> 00:28:04.920
They sold Jaguar, they sold Land Rover, they
sold Aston Martin and the latest sale that

00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:10.330
was just completed by the way, I think yesterday,
was the sale of Volvo to a Chinese firm called

00:28:10.330 --> 00:28:11.330
Geely Automobile.

00:28:11.330 --> 00:28:18.990
Another myth is that President Obama overstepped
his bounds in ousting Rick Wagoner as the

00:28:18.990 --> 00:28:24.470
CEO of General Motors. Again, it's not true.
I mean, look at the facts here. Any time that

00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:28.010
a company is going into bankruptcy and gets
restructured, the lenders, the people who

00:28:28.010 --> 00:28:34.140
provide the debtor in possession financing,
they call the shots. I mean, they're controlling

00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:38.970
the company now. And any lender, any private
industry lender that came in, any private

00:28:38.970 --> 00:28:43.360
sector lender, would've insisted on new management
at General Motors. Basically, the President

00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:52.120
did exactly the same thing as any private
sector lender would have done.

00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:56.730
Another myth of the bailout: Chrysler secured
creditors going on about 28 cents on the dollar

00:28:56.730 --> 00:29:01.520
on their debt, even though their debt was
supposedly secured. Secured means you get

00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:05.450
paid off at the top of the line; 100 cents
on the dollar in the event of a corporate

00:29:05.450 --> 00:29:12.860
collapse. But the truth is these guys got
more money, far more money in the settlement

00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:18.070
that the government took to the bankruptcy
courts than they would've gotten if Chrysler

00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:20.250
had simply liquidated. They would've gotten
virtually nothing if Chrysler had been liquidated.

00:29:20.250 --> 00:29:24.941
The fact the government helped reorganize
Chrysler gave them about 28 cents on the dollar,

00:29:24.941 --> 00:29:30.250
which is far better than they would have done.
And don't forget, bankruptcy judges in the

00:29:30.250 --> 00:29:37.240
U.S. Supreme Court approved this settlement.
So, obviously it conformed to American rule

00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:38.460
of law.

00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:43.970
And finally, another myth of the bailout is
that UAW won and again, they didn't want control

00:29:43.970 --> 00:29:49.110
of Chrysler, they wanted hard cold cash. The
government forced them to take control of

00:29:49.110 --> 00:29:54.190
Chrysler for their healthcare fund. So, I
think there's a lot of myths that need to

00:29:54.190 --> 00:29:56.850
be cleared up about this whole situation.

00:29:56.850 --> 00:30:01.790
Now for the big question. Will it work? Look,
frankly, a year later it's working better

00:30:01.790 --> 00:30:07.330
than anybody ever expected. Ford is now profitable;
GM and Chrysler are now modestly profitable,

00:30:07.330 --> 00:30:13.150
right around break even. GM is gonna do an
IPO probably later this year and the government

00:30:13.150 --> 00:30:17.270
will be able to sell some of its shares at
initial public stock offerings and that'll

00:30:17.270 --> 00:30:23.270
allow the taxpayers to begin getting repaid.
The GM IPO and the Chrysler IPO are gonna

00:30:23.270 --> 00:30:27.300
be classic, by the way. And do you know what
this means? This means the Wall Street banks

00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:32.080
that went broke are gonna take public the
car companies that went broke. Is this a great

00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:37.890
country, or what? So, but that's gonna happen
and that'll be the beginning of us getting

00:30:37.890 --> 00:30:42.520
repaid; we taxpayers. And it's our money.
And you guys work pretty hard; so do I. I

00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:48.920
mean, I don't want my money going to people
who can't manage a business right.

00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:52.390
The future structure of this industry, there's
not gonna be a Big Three anymore. There's

00:30:52.390 --> 00:31:01.040
gonna be a Medium Six. I mean, Ford, GM, Toyota,
Honda, Nissan, maybe Fiat-Chrysler, maybe

00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:06.370
Hyundai or even Volkswagen; they all have
between 10 and 20 percent of the U.S. market,

00:31:06.370 --> 00:31:11.090
unlike the glory days of the auto industry
in the '50s and '60s when GM had more than

00:31:11.090 --> 00:31:15.590
half the market and everybody else divided
the rest. Those days are gone.

00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:23.230
This is a story, I think, filled with lessons
and if I can maybe be a little provocative:

00:31:23.230 --> 00:31:27.940
you guys are one of the greatest companies
on Earth, but so was General Motors a half

00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:35.320
a century ago. And you saw what arrogance
and hubris did to GM and to Chrysler and almost

00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:40.780
did to Ford. And arrogance and hubris, by
the way, do not know industry bounds; they

00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:45.850
do not know national bounds. I mean, the latest
company that fell victim to it--well, a couple

00:31:45.850 --> 00:31:51.300
companies really--Toyota, all those, the quality
began to deteriorate really about five or

00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:57.040
six years ago before all these, this uproar
happened over sudden acceleration. So, it's

00:31:57.040 --> 00:32:05.800
just a good lesson in human behavior, really,
to be wary of. The other thing is, look, I'm

00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:11.440
gonna make a confession here, I'm a Republican,
I'm a free market guy. I didn't vote for Obama.

00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:15.991
I think he did the right thing on this. I
think if he would have let General Motors

00:32:15.991 --> 00:32:22.420
and Ford simply collapse in the middle of
the economic crisis last year, the, I don't

00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:27.680
think we'd be seeing the bottom yet of the
recession. Just think of all car dealers across

00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:31.260
the country would have gone out of business,
advertising agencies here in New York, the

00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:36.540
accountants that deal with the car dealers
and the ad agencies and the doctors that provide

00:32:36.540 --> 00:32:40.340
healthcare to all these people who were employed
by the dealers and the accountants and all

00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:47.050
this sort of stuff. The ripple effects would
have been just catastrophic. So, the bone

00:32:47.050 --> 00:32:50.850
of battle, I'm a conservative guy, but I'm
a journalist first and really gotta keep your

00:32:50.850 --> 00:32:55.660
mind open when you're going to look into a
situation. And the President and his people

00:32:55.660 --> 00:33:01.260
did the right thing here. That being said,
here's what worries me. I mean, we're a country

00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:06.820
that is running unsustainable federal deficits;
a trillion dollars or more in the last couple

00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:13.080
years. America came in and bailed out Detroit,
so the worry in the future is look, if we

00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:18.470
keep relying on the Chinese government to
buy U.S. debt that, because we're running

00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:23.120
deficits, because we're spending more than
our means, I'm not sure that there's anybody

00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:26.380
in the future that's going to step up and
bail out America. That's a good lesson to

00:33:26.380 --> 00:33:31.550
keep in mind, too, if you will. So, with that,
I just want to say thanks for being a great

00:33:31.550 --> 00:33:36.571
audience and I'll be glad to duck or answer
any questions if I can.

00:33:36.571 --> 00:33:37.770
[applause]

00:33:37.770 --> 00:33:40.170
Yes, sir.

00:33:40.170 --> 00:33:55.130
&gt;&gt;audience male #1: How are you going to tell
the workers still in charge of [inaudible]

00:33:55.130 --> 00:33:56.130
Jobs Bank [inaudible]?

00:33:56.130 --> 00:34:00.990
&gt;&gt;Paul: Good question. The Jobs Bank was abolished.
The [inaudible] of Automotive Task Force imposed

00:34:00.990 --> 00:34:09.119
some severe conditions, reforms, I'd call
them reforms, on the union company relationships.

00:34:09.119 --> 00:34:13.829
And one of those reforms is the Jobs Bank
is abolished; end of story, it's gone. They

00:34:13.829 --> 00:34:18.330
also insisted on abolishing most of the very
restrictive and [further abating] work rules

00:34:18.330 --> 00:34:22.359
that the companies had with their unions.
For example, there were hundreds and hundreds

00:34:22.359 --> 00:34:30.299
of different job classifications that said,
"Well, if a machine breaks down, OK? I'm Paul

00:34:30.299 --> 00:34:34.240
and I'm standing right next to the machine
and I know how to fix it, but wait a minute.

00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:38.960
It's not listed as my job responsibility to
fix it. That's Suzie's job responsibility

00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:43.720
and she's on her lunch hour, OK? And she's
on, or on break. She'll be here in a half

00:34:43.720 --> 00:34:47.549
hour so you gotta wait for her for the machine
to get fixed." So the whole darn factory shuts

00:34:47.549 --> 00:34:54.769
down for a half hour. All that stuff, most
of that stuff, is gone. So the task force

00:34:54.769 --> 00:35:00.309
did insist on that. There's a no-strike provision
imposed on both General Motors and Chrysler

00:35:00.309 --> 00:35:05.600
until 2015, so the UAW can't strike those
two companies. That's what the union had to

00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:11.900
agree to as a condition, as the government's
condition, for getting government funds. One

00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:18.609
of the more fascinating things in my research
for this book, if you will, Kay Clugston here

00:35:18.609 --> 00:35:24.150
is a native of Detroit, so she'll relate to
this; I went to, spent a lot of time in Detroit.

00:35:24.150 --> 00:35:29.020
I went to the Walter Reuther Labor Library
on the campus of Wayne State University. Walter

00:35:29.020 --> 00:35:35.320
Reuther was the legendary president of the
UAW in the '50s and the '60s. And in the third

00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:40.310
floor of that Labor Library, on the back at
the archives, on the back shelf there's a

00:35:40.310 --> 00:35:48.250
copy of every UAW contract between the 1940s
and today. And decades ago, those contracts

00:35:48.250 --> 00:35:54.200
were like little pamphlets, right? Now, they're
bigger than phonebooks with rules and regulations

00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:59.539
and this's and that's; 16 pages on seniority
alone. I mean, it would be impossible for

00:35:59.539 --> 00:36:03.779
anyone to manage under into those conditions.
A lot of that stuff was stripped away as a

00:36:03.779 --> 00:36:05.900
condition of these companies getting government
aid.

00:36:05.900 --> 00:36:09.069
Yeah, I'm sorry, yes.

00:36:09.069 --> 00:36:21.500
&gt;&gt;audience male #2: Hi. I was just wondering
what your thoughts were on, as GMsort of comes

00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:22.500
back? There's a recent story of them buying,
I think, AmeriCreditÉ

00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:23.500
&gt;&gt;Paul: Yep.

00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:26.529
&gt;&gt;audience male #2: É and focusing on subprime
loans again.

00:36:26.529 --> 00:36:30.250
&gt;&gt;Paul: Right. A little worrisome, isn't it?

00:36:30.250 --> 00:36:31.250
[Paul laughs]

00:36:31.250 --> 00:36:36.360
Yeah, exactly. Good question. The answer to
that question is, look, I think you have to

00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:42.109
let them manage the business. I think that
subprime lending has always been a part of

00:36:42.109 --> 00:36:48.790
the automobile financing. A lot of people
with subprime credit buy cars. Now, the trick

00:36:48.790 --> 00:36:52.890
is you gotta price for it correctly and you
gotta be, you can't just pass out money to

00:36:52.890 --> 00:36:57.260
everyone so it really depends on how well
they manage this business once they get a

00:36:57.260 --> 00:37:01.740
hold of it. But, as part of their restructuring,
actually, the old General Motors, before they

00:37:01.740 --> 00:37:07.109
went into bankruptcy, sold off control of
GM--it was then called GMAC, which was its

00:37:07.109 --> 00:37:12.200
credit arm, the one that went into subprime
housing lending and so that's now known as

00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:16.089
Allied Bank. And Allied Bank is regaining
profitability. They just reported earnings

00:37:16.089 --> 00:37:21.759
this morning, when I was taking the train
in as a matter of fact, but they haven't repaid

00:37:21.759 --> 00:37:26.900
us taxpayers, either, OK? So, I think that
the new General Motors is making some smart

00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:32.309
moves. One of the most interesting things
to me is that of the top 15 executives, only

00:37:32.309 --> 00:37:36.869
one of them is in the same job there and even
still with the company as is, as was before

00:37:36.869 --> 00:37:44.289
the bankruptcy. And half of the top 15 people
are now under the age of 50, which, by the

00:37:44.289 --> 00:37:48.900
way, makes them older than the average Cadillac
and Buick driver, but that's another problem.

00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:53.000
So, guardedly they're doing well; they're
not out of the woods yet, though. Yes, sir.

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:58.730
&gt;&gt;audience male #3: Hi. If I understand your
thesis, it was basically that this didn't

00:37:58.730 --> 00:38:05.119
have to happen and they said it did to GM
and Chrysler; it was because of bad decisions

00:38:05.119 --> 00:38:06.579
and bad manager made at a very upper level.

00:38:06.579 --> 00:38:07.579
&gt;&gt;Paul: Right.

00:38:07.579 --> 00:38:13.210
&gt;&gt;audience male #3: Now, the traditional thought
on that is that this is not supposed to happen

00:38:13.210 --> 00:38:19.900
because the owners, i.e., the stock market,
the investors, are going to manage the managers.

00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:24.339
That they're going to fire underperforming
bad managers, especially if they underperform

00:38:24.339 --> 00:38:30.970
and lose billions over a period of multiple
years. Clearly, this didn't happen here. What's

00:38:30.970 --> 00:38:37.260
supposed to be the check on this process failed.
Is there something unusual about these two

00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:43.500
companies or is the conventional wisdom that
we can rely on the stock market and stockowners

00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:52.650
to manage the top-level executives flawed?
And if so, are we; is every other large company

00:38:52.650 --> 00:38:58.510
over a large period of time potentially at
risk for this sort of problem?

00:38:58.510 --> 00:39:02.000
&gt;&gt;Paul: You know, that is a great question
and the answer to all those sub questions

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:07.930
is yes. I mean, I'm a student of corporate
governance. I must say that this topic is

00:39:07.930 --> 00:39:13.300
about as exciting as dental floss, right?
But it's critical because it's how organizations

00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:20.700
like Google and Microsoft and GM and IBM are
run. And unfortunately, what has been a consistent

00:39:20.700 --> 00:39:25.970
problem in American boardrooms is that the
directors who are supposed to represent the

00:39:25.970 --> 00:39:31.559
shareholders frankly fall in the position
of becoming defenders of management at all

00:39:31.559 --> 00:39:35.970
costs because they're all buddies and the
CEO put you on the board and all that sort

00:39:35.970 --> 00:39:40.160
of thing, as opposed to really insisting on
corporate performance. Is it better than it

00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:46.940
used to be? Yeah, but there's been some big
slip-ups. I am shocked, by the way, shocked,

00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:51.000
that the members of the General Motors board
of directors who presided over this demise--I

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:58.260
mean, the company ran out of cash--I'm shocked
that they haven't been sued. OK? There's gotta

00:39:58.260 --> 00:40:01.890
be some lawyer out there somewhere who probably
wanted to do this, but American law gives

00:40:01.890 --> 00:40:05.690
great judgment, gives directors great latitude
in their judgment. It's something called the

00:40:05.690 --> 00:40:10.230
"business judgment rule." It's hard to win
those suits, which probably explains it. Here's

00:40:10.230 --> 00:40:14.349
the other fascinating thing. I pointed out
the difference between Ford and General Motors,

00:40:14.349 --> 00:40:21.030
right? Ford's corporate governance system
on paper is a disaster. The Ford family has

00:40:21.030 --> 00:40:26.259
about two or three percent of the stock, they
control 40 percent of the votes. Their elections

00:40:26.259 --> 00:40:31.279
are about as democratic as elections in North
Korea. I don't think anybody calls Bill Ford,

00:40:31.279 --> 00:40:37.970
Jr. ,"Dear Leader," but it's the same idea,
right? OK? But, you had a group of people

00:40:37.970 --> 00:40:42.019
with a significant financial and emotional
stake in the company that came together and

00:40:42.019 --> 00:40:47.809
made tough decisions in the nick of time and
saved that company. In General Motors, nobody

00:40:47.809 --> 00:40:53.960
on that board has any significant financial
or emotional investment in that company and

00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:59.900
they just let it go down the tubes and it's
terrible. And at General Motors, the people

00:40:59.900 --> 00:41:03.460
should be ashamed of themselves, absolutely
ashamed at themselves. Yes, sir.

00:41:03.460 --> 00:41:09.130
&gt;&gt;audience male #4: Hi. I'm wondering how
much political activity GM and Chrysler are

00:41:09.130 --> 00:41:13.369
still engaging in and whether you think it's
a problem that they would use taxpayer money

00:41:13.369 --> 00:41:15.339
for political lobbying?

00:41:15.339 --> 00:41:20.599
&gt;&gt;Paul: Well, it's a good question. I have
a problem with the whole lobbying system anyway.

00:41:20.599 --> 00:41:25.510
I mean, buying influence, if you will. But
nonetheless, people have the right and organizations

00:41:25.510 --> 00:41:30.819
have the right to petition their government.
If the UAW can do it, why can't companies

00:41:30.819 --> 00:41:36.130
do it? There are certain ethical lines you
certainly don't want to draw. I think, by

00:41:36.130 --> 00:41:41.410
and large, they are staying away from overt
political activity, but of course they're

00:41:41.410 --> 00:41:47.920
owned, General Motors is owned by the government.
So they, I will say this though, the government,

00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:52.019
as far as I know, is really staying out of
the daily management of these companies. Now

00:41:52.019 --> 00:41:58.349
that doesn't mean like when AmeriCredit was
purchased a few days ago, there's a "no surprises"

00:41:58.349 --> 00:42:02.289
rule and GM gave the Treasury Department a
heads-up, said we're gonna do it, and the

00:42:02.289 --> 00:42:08.460
Treasury said it's your call and that sort
of thing. So, you gotta let these people run

00:42:08.460 --> 00:42:14.020
their business. Do you remember about a month
ago when that Tiger pitcher threw that almost-perfect

00:42:14.020 --> 00:42:18.579
game out in Detroit and got robbed by the
bad call by the ump and the ump with a lot

00:42:18.579 --> 00:42:23.130
of class came, said, "I made a mistake."?
GM gave that pitcher a Corvette and there

00:42:23.130 --> 00:42:27.190
were people around the country who said, "You
know it's terrible using our tax dollars to

00:42:27.190 --> 00:42:31.299
give away the Corvette. I mean, that's ridiculous."
I'm sorry, it was great marketing. It was

00:42:31.299 --> 00:42:34.460
a brilliant marketing move. You gotta let
them run the business. Yes.

00:42:34.460 --> 00:42:37.019
&gt;&gt;audience male #5: So, you liked the bailout--

00:42:37.019 --> 00:42:42.269
&gt;&gt;Paul: I didn't say I liked it, I'd say it's,
I mean, my analogy, frankly, it's like changing

00:42:42.269 --> 00:42:44.650
a diaper. There's some dirty jobs that you
just gotta do.

00:42:44.650 --> 00:42:48.730
&gt;&gt;audience male #6: Yeah, but I sort of worry,
I mean, first of all, I know you say this

00:42:48.730 --> 00:42:53.599
is all bad management, but the history of
industry is an awful lot of them go downhill.

00:42:53.599 --> 00:42:59.109
Let's look at the companies that were in the
Dow Jones Industrial Average when they started,

00:42:59.109 --> 00:43:03.890
there were people like National Leathery that
no one's ever heard of for decades and the

00:43:03.890 --> 00:43:09.029
reason I am asking is I'm sort of worried
someone at the FDC floated a proposal recently

00:43:09.029 --> 00:43:13.359
that, "Well, we should save the newspaper
business by putting a $5 a month fee or tax,

00:43:13.359 --> 00:43:18.990
that you choose to call it, on all internet
service or maybe on all mobile phone service.

00:43:18.990 --> 00:43:25.020
And I'm looking at this saying, "Yeah, I've
got an emotional attachment to the "New York

00:43:25.020 --> 00:43:29.020
Times.'" I've read it every day for 50 years,
but is this really the way we want the economy

00:43:29.020 --> 00:43:34.599
to work that we're always putting our money
into old industries rather than new ones?

00:43:34.599 --> 00:43:38.579
&gt;&gt;Paul: That's a great question and the answer
is I think it would be a disaster for newspapers

00:43:38.579 --> 00:43:45.810
to get tax subsidies of any form. The real
danger here is that we take this emergency

00:43:45.810 --> 00:43:50.609
action that, again, in my judgment and in
the judgment of a lot of other people, was

00:43:50.609 --> 00:43:58.160
necessary to prevent an economic crisis from
becoming an economic collapse in the country.

00:43:58.160 --> 00:44:02.270
And we set all kinds of bad precedents there
and it's up to the American people to resist

00:44:02.270 --> 00:44:06.940
that kind of nonsense, frankly. Governments
shouldn't be picking winners and losers. I

00:44:06.940 --> 00:44:13.089
have less of an emotional attachment to the
"New York Times" having worked for the "Wall

00:44:13.089 --> 00:44:14.089
Street Journal," but--

00:44:14.089 --> 00:44:15.089
[laughter]

00:44:15.089 --> 00:44:19.619
my brother, Adam's uncle, is one of the senior
editors at "The Times," so it makes for some

00:44:19.619 --> 00:44:21.980
really interesting Thanksgiving dinner conversations.

00:44:21.980 --> 00:44:22.980
[Paul laughs]

00:44:22.980 --> 00:44:27.720
&gt;&gt;audience male #7: Keeping that the UAWs
perverse set of incentives were a good chunk

00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:32.490
of what got things down and it seemed to me
that making them take a big chunk of Chrysler

00:44:32.490 --> 00:44:38.289
was a good idea, why didn't they get a big
chunk of GM, too, so that they would have,

00:44:38.289 --> 00:44:39.980
their incentives would be better aligned there
as well?

00:44:39.980 --> 00:44:46.740
&gt;&gt;Paul: They do have a big chunk of GM; it's
just not as big. They have, I think, about

00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:50.619
20 percent of General Motors. It's just not
as big and basically, because GM was so much

00:44:50.619 --> 00:44:58.980
bigger that the value of what GM owed the
union for its pension fund for such a large

00:44:58.980 --> 00:45:03.300
company wasn't nearly as much of the company
as it was for Chrysler. So, it's really a

00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:06.700
mathematical equation if you boil down to
it. Good question, though.

00:45:06.700 --> 00:45:10.369
&gt;&gt;audience male #8: You said you were a free
market guy and I was wondering what your view

00:45:10.369 --> 00:45:17.049
was for the Cash for Clunkers program, whether
you think it was as big a success as it was

00:45:17.049 --> 00:45:18.299
being touted?

00:45:18.299 --> 00:45:19.974
&gt;&gt;Paul: I think it was a disaster. It was
overreach. I can think of a story, one of

00:45:19.974 --> 00:45:25.499
my neighbors down in Florida, where I live
in the winter, he took advantage of a loophole

00:45:25.499 --> 00:45:28.710
in this program to get a new golf cart on
Cash for Clunkers. He doesn't know whether

00:45:28.710 --> 00:45:35.119
to be embarrassed about it or proud of it,
to be honest with you. No, it was overreach.

00:45:35.119 --> 00:45:40.240
I think the danger in all these sort of things
is you don't know where to stop and that was

00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:41.819
a bad thing to do.

00:45:41.819 --> 00:45:47.530
&gt;&gt;audience male #9: You touched on it briefly
before, but the '80s bailout of Chrysler É

00:45:47.530 --> 00:45:48.530
&gt;&gt;Paul: Yep.

00:45:48.530 --> 00:45:50.720
&gt;&gt;audience male #10: É would you say that
worked out well? Was that a good idea if you

00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:55.740
were Ronald Reagan in 1982 or whatever? Or
not a fan? Or É

00:45:55.740 --> 00:46:00.430
&gt;&gt;Paul: It's a great question, the 1980 bailout
of Chrysler, it was actually started under

00:46:00.430 --> 00:46:05.259
the Carter Administration and then when Reagan
won the White House, he basically was, had

00:46:05.259 --> 00:46:10.770
to figure out, "Hey, do we continue on this
road or not?" And they decided to do it. Again,

00:46:10.770 --> 00:46:14.690
strict conditions were imposed on Chrysler.
Here's the remarkable thing about that. The

00:46:14.690 --> 00:46:21.049
U.S. taxpayers actually made money on that
deal. We made, we as a nation, made about

00:46:21.049 --> 00:46:27.150
$400 million on that Chrysler bailout and
the reason is, is at that time, the government

00:46:27.150 --> 00:46:31.510
got--the government, in that case, did not
provide any direct loans to Chrysler provided

00:46:31.510 --> 00:46:36.210
guarantees of loans made by private banks
and private lenders. But in return for those

00:46:36.210 --> 00:46:42.220
guarantees, the government got warrants to
buy Chrysler stock. When the K car came out,

00:46:42.220 --> 00:46:46.760
Plymouth, Aries, Dodge, Reliant and then the
minivans came out, Chrysler stock went from

00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:53.680
like, two to sixty. Sort of like Google, you
know? In the early days at least. Let's hope

00:46:53.680 --> 00:46:59.569
again. But the government made a lot of money
on those warrants. Actually, one of the most

00:46:59.569 --> 00:47:04.839
outrageous things though, was that Lee Iacocca,
the CEO of Chrysler, thought the government

00:47:04.839 --> 00:47:09.700
was making obscene profits on Chrysler stock,
even though the government had saved the company,

00:47:09.700 --> 00:47:13.400
so he called the Secretary of the Treasury
and said, "You ought to not exercise those

00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:17.670
warrants. You outta just let them lapse."
They got in a shouting match and said some

00:47:17.670 --> 00:47:22.619
words that I can't say on TV, even Google
internal TV, but anyway, we made money on

00:47:22.619 --> 00:47:23.710
that deal.

00:47:23.710 --> 00:47:33.260
&gt;&gt;audience male #11: A question I always had
about the financial bailouts, I think it applies

00:47:33.260 --> 00:47:34.260
to the cars as well as--is there anything
that can be done to make sure we don't get

00:47:34.260 --> 00:47:38.150
in a position where the government has to
bailout? I also agree that maybe it was the

00:47:38.150 --> 00:47:41.579
right thing to do, but what can be done to
just put rules in place now so that this situation

00:47:41.579 --> 00:47:43.950
could never arise again?

00:47:43.950 --> 00:47:47.509
&gt;&gt;Paul: That's another great question, but
the problem is, I don't think they even, there's

00:47:47.509 --> 00:47:53.009
no guarantees in life, OK? There's no guarantee
that I'm gonna walk out and get home safely.

00:47:53.009 --> 00:47:58.390
I think that what you have to do, what they
had done is--you've heard the term probably

00:47:58.390 --> 00:48:02.650
if you've read it somewhere, called "moral
hazard," and that, basically, is when you

00:48:02.650 --> 00:48:06.250
bailout people from their own reckless behavior,
they'll just do it over and over again and

00:48:06.250 --> 00:48:12.019
you encourage that. I think what the government
did right here, even though there was a bailout,

00:48:12.019 --> 00:48:16.609
was a lot of pain inflicted by these people
on everyone involved. I mean, dealers lost

00:48:16.609 --> 00:48:21.599
franchises, workers lost jobs; one of the
workers in my book is a really nice guy out

00:48:21.599 --> 00:48:27.391
in Belvedere, Illinois, a town near Rockford.
Previously, he would've gone to the Jobs Bank

00:48:27.391 --> 00:48:32.299
and gotten paid indefinitely. When that was
abolished, he left the company, got a buyout

00:48:32.299 --> 00:48:37.440
and he's really struggling. He's out of money
and things are going tough. I went onto his

00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:42.410
Facebook page the other day and it was very
poignant. He said, "So why does the bottom

00:48:42.410 --> 00:48:49.069
have to be so far down?" So, I think the answer
to your question is we can never prevent it

00:48:49.069 --> 00:48:54.859
from happening again, but we can make it so
painful that we can encourage people to act

00:48:54.859 --> 00:49:00.289
responsibly. In the end, to have everyone
act responsibly all the time is a pretty tough

00:49:00.289 --> 00:49:01.289
order.

00:49:01.289 --> 00:49:02.289
[Paul laughs]

00:49:02.289 --> 00:49:09.442
&gt;&gt;audience male #12: One of the questions
I have wasn't in the list of the reasons for

00:49:09.442 --> 00:49:13.430
the failure, but I've heard on a previous
book written on a similar topic, and I don't

00:49:13.430 --> 00:49:19.940
know how far that's true, that at Ford at
some point in the past they decided they wanted

00:49:19.940 --> 00:49:26.190
to make a new car and they got together in
a room and they decided what they wanted to

00:49:26.190 --> 00:49:30.049
do and looked around and they found that there
was no engineer there. Everybody had an MBA,

00:49:30.049 --> 00:49:34.489
but they couldn't ask technical questions.
My question is, I mean, is, do you think that

00:49:34.489 --> 00:49:40.540
a lack of focus on the actual engineering
of the cars was also one of the reasons for

00:49:40.540 --> 00:49:42.730
the failures, besides the other things?

00:49:42.730 --> 00:49:48.880
&gt;&gt;Paul: Yeah, I do. Over a period of time,
basically, the Detroit companies came to be

00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:54.769
dominated by MBAs and marketing types and
especially by financial types and technological

00:49:54.769 --> 00:50:00.700
expertise as an advancement really--the whole
idea was you can sell the sizzle, the styling

00:50:00.700 --> 00:50:06.090
and the tail fins and all that kind of stuff,
but what the Japanese came in with, they made

00:50:06.090 --> 00:50:11.069
these wonderful, little cars that had engines
that were, they had, they hummed like sewing

00:50:11.069 --> 00:50:20.880
machines. They were precision instruments.
And I do think the demise of our engineering

00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:27.089
expertise or the lack of status, I mean, look,
Google's a great company, but I think the

00:50:27.089 --> 00:50:31.779
engineers here have status and clout, right?
I mean, gosh, they run the company. And maybe

00:50:31.779 --> 00:50:35.670
that's the way it should have been in Detroit
for a long time. As a matter of fact, Adam

00:50:35.670 --> 00:50:38.849
Mulally of Ford is an engineer. Yes, sir.

00:50:38.849 --> 00:50:44.859
&gt;&gt;audience male #13: I just wanna ask how
much do you think the future success of companies

00:50:44.859 --> 00:50:50.039
depends on alternative fuels? And investing
in hybrids and all that?

00:50:50.039 --> 00:50:55.049
&gt;&gt;Paul: Yeah, I think in the long term it
will. How long does it take to get there?

00:50:55.049 --> 00:51:00.049
How long does it take for us to get to alternative
fuels? I think the Chevy Volt, there was an

00:51:00.049 --> 00:51:03.170
article in the "New York Times" that said,
"Hey, this thing is probably gonna be a disaster

00:51:03.170 --> 00:51:10.109
because it's overpriced and it requires tax
credits of $7,500 to get it down to the mid-$30,000

00:51:10.109 --> 00:51:15.819
range and it's still not gonna do much more
than a Prius will do." But I think a hybrid,

00:51:15.819 --> 00:51:21.460
I'm very skeptical about all electric cars.
I mean, I wouldn't buy one; I'm afraid it's

00:51:21.460 --> 00:51:25.109
gonna run out of juice at the wrong time.
Gas-electric hybrids are different. They have

00:51:25.109 --> 00:51:28.690
a real future and they're gonna get, there's
gonna be more and more of those. The price

00:51:28.690 --> 00:51:35.789
is gonna come down. Tesla's doing some interesting
stuff out in Silicon Valley, but those are,

00:51:35.789 --> 00:51:40.880
let's face it, that's a $100,000 electric
hot rods. I mean, not many people are gonna

00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:45.569
buy those. One of the GM factories that was
closed as a result of the bankruptcy and restructuring

00:51:45.569 --> 00:51:51.720
is down in Delaware and that's been sold to
Fiskar, which is doing high-tech hybrid sports

00:51:51.720 --> 00:51:57.130
cars. So, these things are really on the agenda
and it really all depends on the price of

00:51:57.130 --> 00:52:01.770
gasoline. I think that the government really
wanted--look, there's only three times in

00:52:01.770 --> 00:52:04.839
the history of the U.S. car industry that
people have moved from big cars to smaller

00:52:04.839 --> 00:52:13.089
ones. 1973, the first Arab oil embargo; 1979,
the Iranian oil crisis; in 2008, when oil

00:52:13.089 --> 00:52:18.569
went $170 a barrel or whatever, people respond
to market incentives. So if the government

00:52:18.569 --> 00:52:23.559
really wanted to do this right, what they
would do was raise gasoline taxes; and by

00:52:23.559 --> 00:52:28.309
the way, simultaneously, cut income taxes,
so you'd be taxing consumption, and you'd

00:52:28.309 --> 00:52:33.430
be reducing taxes on production. But that's
just politically unpopular. They're not gonna

00:52:33.430 --> 00:52:34.430
do it.

00:52:34.430 --> 00:52:37.799
&gt;&gt;audience male #14: One problem that looks
to be for my father worked as an engineer

00:52:37.799 --> 00:52:42.749
at Ford was that the line workers are not
listened to. I mean, if you read the articles

00:52:42.749 --> 00:52:46.099
about Toyota, Toyota plants, they make about
two thousand changes a year based on line

00:52:46.099 --> 00:52:49.900
worker things. My dad, from talking to line
workers, he said that people said they quit

00:52:49.900 --> 00:52:55.339
making suggestions because they were ignored
because the management said that you guys

00:52:55.339 --> 00:52:59.650
are a bunch of morons and we know all. Is
that being fixed?

00:52:59.650 --> 00:53:04.410
&gt;&gt;Paul: It's better than it used to be. Is
it as good as it needs to be? No. Now, it's

00:53:04.410 --> 00:53:08.660
fascinating. When, I remember when Honda,
I mentioned in my presentation here that when

00:53:08.660 --> 00:53:13.210
Honda opened its factory in 1982, and people
like me, journalists trouped down there and

00:53:13.210 --> 00:53:16.900
said, "Where's the magic bullet? This thing
is working. Where's all the robots and the

00:53:16.900 --> 00:53:20.829
gizmos?" And there were no robots and gizmos;
I mean, there were a few, but that wasn't

00:53:20.829 --> 00:53:24.489
it. The secret was that the Japanese figured
out how to use the brains of these people

00:53:24.489 --> 00:53:34.339
as well as their bodies, OK? And this, again,
back in history, this clash between the UAW

00:53:34.339 --> 00:53:39.880
and the managements of these companies, more
in the 1930s and '40s, and the violent strikes

00:53:39.880 --> 00:53:43.869
that gave birth to the UAW and all that, a
lot of that has never went away. I remember

00:53:43.869 --> 00:53:49.470
when I was out in Detroit, GM asked me to
visit some of their factories and I went up

00:53:49.470 --> 00:53:53.780
to one engine factory in Buffalo, New York,
just outside Buffalo called Tonawanda, and

00:53:53.780 --> 00:53:59.190
I got this great two-hour dog-and-pony show
about everybody's getting along well and we're

00:53:59.190 --> 00:54:02.559
all doing great and then I said--I was gonna
get a plane back to Detroit--and I said, "Look,

00:54:02.559 --> 00:54:06.009
before I head to the airport, I gotta go to
the boy's room. Can you show me where it is?"

00:54:06.009 --> 00:54:10.890
So I walk around the corner and there's the
salary men's restroom and hourly men's restroom

00:54:10.890 --> 00:54:16.099
[laughter] right next to each other. That
said it all. What can I say? It's in the book,

00:54:16.099 --> 00:54:17.520
by the way. Yes, sir.

00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:22.950
&gt;&gt;audience male #15: So a couple weeks ago,
we had the author of the "War of the Wall

00:54:22.950 --> 00:54:27.930
Street Journal" come in and I was wondering,
given your extensive experience or if you

00:54:27.930 --> 00:54:35.529
had any comment on the fate of Dow Jones and
the "Wall Street Journal" and possibly also,

00:54:35.529 --> 00:54:42.029
how the fate of that family-owned company
compares with the fate of Ford, which seems

00:54:42.029 --> 00:54:44.619
to be doing much better and is also family
owned.

00:54:44.619 --> 00:54:52.760
&gt;&gt;Paul: Yeah, that's a good question. I mean,
look, I worked there 31 years and left at

00:54:52.760 --> 00:54:57.190
the end of 2007. I think the acquisition really
had to happen. I think what happened there

00:54:57.190 --> 00:55:02.859
is that the company was a small company; it
wasn't big enough to survive in this multi-media

00:55:02.859 --> 00:55:07.410
world. Everybody knows what's happened in
the news and especially the newspaper business.

00:55:07.410 --> 00:55:12.009
It's like a lot of companies that was sort
of a master of its world in one environment;

00:55:12.009 --> 00:55:18.839
it really never was able to master this new
high-tech world of the news business. The

00:55:18.839 --> 00:55:21.720
family brought in new leadership in the last
couple years to try to try to change it, but

00:55:21.720 --> 00:55:27.529
unlike the Ford's, they got the wrong guy
instead of the right guy. It's pretty simple.

00:55:27.529 --> 00:55:31.819
There was no assurance, by the way, that Alan
Mulally was gonna work out. The difference

00:55:31.819 --> 00:55:38.589
was that Rupert Murdoch came along and said
the stock's at 35 and I'll pay you 60. For

00:55:38.589 --> 00:55:42.640
me that was a pretty good deal, to be honest
with you. That's why I can write books instead

00:55:42.640 --> 00:55:49.059
of go to an office every day. But I think
it had to happen. The paper, I can't say it's

00:55:49.059 --> 00:55:53.350
better or worse now. It's certainly not a
business newspaper anymore; it's much more

00:55:53.350 --> 00:55:57.140
of a general interest newspaper. Rupert Murdoch
said from the beginning he wanted to make

00:55:57.140 --> 00:56:02.069
it a direct competitive for the "New York
Times" and so he's doing it. And how well

00:56:02.069 --> 00:56:08.410
is that gonna, what's that gonna do? Will
that expand its appeal or will that turn off

00:56:08.410 --> 00:56:13.200
the loyal people who really want a business-focused
newspaper? Will it create a new opportunity

00:56:13.200 --> 00:56:17.349
for the "Financial Times," which remains a
business-focused newspaper? All those questions

00:56:17.349 --> 00:56:19.420
are yet to be answered, so we'll see.

00:56:19.420 --> 00:56:22.970
&gt;&gt;audience male #16: I have two quick follow-up
questions. One is--

00:56:22.970 --> 00:56:24.381
&gt;&gt;Paul: I like your shirt, by the way,

00:56:24.381 --> 00:56:25.381
&gt;&gt;audience male #16: Oh, thank you. I didn't
plan this. I, my wife's from Detroit and we

00:56:25.381 --> 00:56:26.381
go there often.

00:56:26.381 --> 00:56:27.381
&gt;&gt;Paul: Oh, great.

00:56:27.381 --> 00:56:31.380
&gt;&gt;audience male #16: Yeah, there's no rush
hour in Detroit anymore, by the way.

00:56:31.380 --> 00:56:34.099
&gt;&gt;Paul: Yeah, sadly, yeah.

00:56:34.099 --> 00:56:40.880
&gt;&gt;audience member #16: Yeah. One is, I wonder
if, there's a wonderful book on what it's

00:56:40.880 --> 00:56:43.019
like to work on the line, "Rivethead" by Ben
Hamper.

00:56:43.019 --> 00:56:44.019
&gt;&gt;Paul: Right.

00:56:44.019 --> 00:56:45.019
&gt;&gt;audience male#16: Do, do you know him? Have
you--

00:56:45.019 --> 00:56:46.359
&gt;&gt;Paul: I don't know him, but it's a great
book.

00:56:46.359 --> 00:56:47.359
&gt;&gt;audience male#16: Yeah.

00:56:47.359 --> 00:56:48.359
&gt;&gt;Paul: Yeah.

00:56:48.359 --> 00:56:50.270
&gt;&gt;audience male #16: And the other is that
if you could just comment on the phenomenon

00:56:50.270 --> 00:56:54.109
of peak oil, which seems to be pretty much
going along as predicted.

00:56:54.109 --> 00:56:55.109
&gt;&gt;Paul: Sorry.

00:56:55.109 --> 00:56:59.869
&gt;&gt;audience male#16: Peak oil: the world oil
production is getting set to, maybe has, nosed

00:56:59.869 --> 00:57:00.869
over.

00:57:00.869 --> 00:57:08.229
&gt;&gt;Paul: Oh, that's right. Yeah, I'm not an
oil expert, but I do know that, look, I mean,

00:57:08.229 --> 00:57:16.240
again it's, the marketplace responds to economic
messages, right? So, I mean, there's oil,

00:57:16.240 --> 00:57:20.859
I think there's lots of oil out there. The
question is how much does it cost to produce

00:57:20.859 --> 00:57:28.499
it? I mean, how much does it take to all those
tar sands up in Canada? Can you dig up all

00:57:28.499 --> 00:57:34.049
that oil containing sand and squeeze, like
a big ringer, squeeze the oil out of it and

00:57:34.049 --> 00:57:37.590
all that? But it's a high--that's a lot more
expensive than it is to pumping oil out of

00:57:37.590 --> 00:57:44.760
Oklahoma or Saudi Arabia, so that's why I
think that over time, hybrids will, hybrids

00:57:44.760 --> 00:57:50.509
and other less oil-dependant vehicles will
be important, but it's gonna awhile because

00:57:50.509 --> 00:57:55.609
right now the cost is still, the advantage
is still going to the Shell station.

00:57:55.609 --> 00:57:59.099
&gt;&gt;Kay: Thank you for coming today. We really
appreciate it.

00:57:59.099 --> 00:58:03.839
&gt;&gt;Paul: Oh, well, thank you, Kay. A lot of
fun. Good questions.

00:58:03.839 --> 00:58:05.299
[applause]
