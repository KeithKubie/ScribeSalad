00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.300
 Christopher Nolan, as a filmmaker. His works always have subtle boundaries 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.200
 If there is a theme throughout his work... 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:36.080
 That is the movie, the so-called shared story. Can become a strong cultural influence 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:42.300
 Many people have noticed that many of his works refer to the film production itself. 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:48.140
 For example, the "full start" team is very similar to the film production team (director, art director, producer, actor) 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.400
 Interestingly, many of his works can be called "post-screen movies". 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:59.040
 Nolan tried to avoid the appearance of a movie in his work. 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:04.340
 For example, when writing a Batman script. Bruce Wein and his parents 

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:12.000
 After watching the "masked man Sulu" in the cinema, the parents were murdered. Contributed to the origin of the Dark Knight 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:20.080
 However, in "Batman: Wartime", I adapted to see Mefistofele at the Opera House. 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.500
 This change is not without reason, as Nolan mentioned in the interview. 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.440
 We decided not to let Bruce go to the cinema to see "masked man Sulu" because let the characters watch movies in the movie... 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.120
 It’s totally different from watching a movie in a manga. 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.820
 It will create something destructive. This is what we want to avoid. 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:46.220
 The reason that Nolan wants to avoid is also the reason that is above everything. His film pursues "hiking the world" 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:53.400
 Use the power of narrative to break the border and draw you into the story. 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:02:00.660
 The subtle line of Nolan's work is to make you feel that it is a movie. 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.800
 In other words, it is hidden in the eyes of the public. 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:12.220
 Hidden in the eyes of the public is the fifth part of Nolan and my favorite work. The theme of "top showdown" 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:18.180
 He uses this technique like a textbook. You can even call it "the ultimate in filmmaking." 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:24.200
 In the words of Nolan, this movie makes you feel immersed and there is no destructive thing. 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.200
 For example, the first continuous lens first comes into view with the movie title. 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.420
 The mysterious shot behind the title is a lot of messy top hats in the woods. 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:40.720
 If you read this movie, you will know that there is another meaning in this scene. 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.880
 Because these top hats represent the movie "Top Showdown" itself (the title of The Prestige is the last step of the magic three steps, appeared.) 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:51.540
 The second clue is that the number of hats is double, a large number of copies, and countless 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:57.960
 This is the key to the magic tricks in the film. It also echoes in the second act. 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.300
 a large number of identical canaries in a bird cage 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.820
 Michael Kane begins to explain the magic trick 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:13.080
 Each magic contains three parts, or actions. Take the virtual reality, steal the day, and finally... show up 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.400
 This serial lens carefully sets the "virtual reality" of the movie itself. 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.040
 Kristen Bell and Hugh Jackman play Effie Budan and Robert Angel 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:25.620
 When Mi Gao Kenn performed magic on the little girl, the narration explained the method. 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.860
 The movie itself is performing its own magic... using the cut. 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.540
 Where did the narration come from? 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:38.580
 In the movie, the narration is usually a matter of explaining something happening in the future. 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:43.100
 At the end of the scene, the judge of the court who turned to the Bhutan murder was asking about Michael. 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.960
 The last paragraph of Michael's explanation is his testimony. 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:52.740
 We will not know until the end. Fragment of little girl and canary magic... 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.700
 At the point in time, it is actually the end of the movie. 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:01.000
 Nolan uses the narration and scene editing to convert the connection of time 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.320
 This replacement is the key to the whole movie. 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:12.180
 The top-of-the-line squad is all about magic with objects related to time and space. 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.880
 This is exactly what all the movies are doing. 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:21.600
 Most of the clips are made through simple cuts. Can connect "short distance" and "continuous time" 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.320
 This is what most people think. 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:30.280
 However, it is also a simple splicing. Nolan is able to cross "long distance" and "long time" 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:35.760
 Nolan once mentioned that he saw the "red alert" directed by Terrence Malik and learned the skills of this technique. 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:41.540
 In the film, Malik cuts the pieces of memories without blurring, fading out or ripples. 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:44.460
 But it can resonate strongly with the audience. 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:50.920
 The "Top Showdown" brings this skill to the ultimate in the editing of complex and intertwined memories. 

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:55.040
 Nolan uses the diaries of Budan and Angel as his means 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:00.760
 When he built this technique, he could use narratives at any time, natural editing memories. 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:04.940
 In this way, the "top confrontation" proves the unique ability of the film. 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:08.180
 But you don't have to compromise with the audience, causing an unnatural feeling. 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:13.160
 The complex narrative structure is the story that Nolan wants to tell. 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:17.420
 The film must hide the secret until it is revealed to the audience. 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:24.460
 This is the outstanding talent of Christopher Nolan as a filmmaker. Strong and powerful film narrative talent 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:28.600
 He can use a lot of future elements to form a plot 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:35.280
 Even giving you all the clues is not the last scene... 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:41.560
 If the "top showdown" only allows us to learn these, I will call it a good movie. 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:47.120
 But it's not just that there is a fragment, which is often ignored but conveys a focus. 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.400
 He killed the bird. what? 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.380
 No, he killed the bird. 

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:59.940
 did you see? He is fine, just here. 

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:03.100
 But where is his brother? 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:08.280
 You can watch the "top showdown" and enjoy its storyline 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.420
 It was Nolan's promise, and he wanted to surprise us. 

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:15.700
 The movie line also said: "The audience wants to be fooled." 

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:22.840
 But no matter what movie, even the narrative compact "top showdown", while you are immersed in the story, you can still be keen to observe. 

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:29.120
 Just as the boy understands the magic of the canary, we can also discover the mystery of the movie. 

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:33.940
 Of course, most of us are talking about editing skills but he is telling the story. 

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:40.760
 Any storytelling technique has deeply influenced the composition of our memories. 

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.680
 Whether shared or private 

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:48.240
 I just want to say that studying movies doesn’t ruin it’s incredible 

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:53.800
 Instead, you will feel that the incomprehensible parliament gives back to the real world. 

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:02.280
