[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.744 --> 00:00:07.910
NATHAN RUNKLE: So today, I
want to talk a little bit

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.540
about my story, founding
Mercy for Animals, the work

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.600
that we do to give
farmed animals a voice

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.050
on an international level,
why animals even matter,

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:23.320
and what the future of our
food system can look like.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.510
So I guess you could
say it makes sense

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:28.330
that I would start an
international animal rights

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.670
organization given the
fact that I was actually

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:32.930
delivered by a veterinarian.

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:38.470
My dad, Mark, who you see
illegally driving around

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.440
with me in this photograph,
was a veterinarian,

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.300
graduated from OSU.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.870
And I was born on
the couch at home

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.260
in a village of less than
2,000 people in rural Ohio.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.220
So I was slated to be a
fifth generation farmer,

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.000
but my love for animals
and fascination for animals

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.420
would lead me on a
very different path.

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.780
Now, they say that big lessons
can come in small packages,

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.510
and that was definitely
the case for me.

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:12.700
And that little package
was a rat named Cesar.

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.450
When I was six years old, I
went across the cornfields

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.950
from our house to a couple
whose name was Gene and Sylvia,

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:26.500
and they actually raised animals
for research in laboratories.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.310
They raised rabbits, mice,
rats, and guinea pigs,

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.544
and they rented the
property from my parents.

00:01:32.544 --> 00:01:34.210
And one afternoon
when I went over there

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.760
with my mom to collect
that month's rent check,

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.890
Sylvia asked if I wanted to
see the animals because she

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.140
knew of my deep love for them.

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:42.777
And I said, yes, of course.

00:01:42.777 --> 00:01:44.110
She took me inside of the sheds.

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.770
And now I really look back in
horror at what I saw there.

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.070
These animals crammed in
tiny cages, dead animals

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.980
in the corners, the
smell of ammonia.

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.420
She reached into
one of the cages

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.850
and pulled this white
rat out by his tail

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.330
and lowered him into my
hands, and I begged her

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.160
to allow me to take him home.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.810
And she said yes.

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.010
My mother said yes.

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:07.780
And I named this
little guy Cesar.

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.309
And he became my best friend
for about 2 and 1/2 years.

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:13.600
He would sit on my shoulder
as I went around the house.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.810
He knew his name.

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.850
He would come running
when I called him.

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.810
And I realized just how
intelligent and social

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.010
these animals are.

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.950
How they have their own
unique personalities.

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.400
But Cesar also taught
me about the prejudices

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.100
that humans bring to the
table with certain animals.

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.160
And he started to peel back
the layers of my own view,

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.590
as a young child,
about what separates

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.200
animals that we consider
to be pests from those

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.840
that we consider to
be pets, and those

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.980
that we consider friends and
those that we consider food.

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.240
I would take friends and
friends' parents to see Cesar,

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.070
and so many of them would shriek
in horror and disgust, saying,

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.770
ew, a rat.

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:58.360
Look at his tail.

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.660
They didn't know him as
an individual as I did.

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:08.070
They were judging Cesar for
what he was, not who he was.

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.430
I started to realize
from Cesar that when

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.110
it comes to having
personalities,

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.330
and minds, and interests,
and a spark for life,

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.030
that all animals
are really equal,

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.210
and the difference is only
our perception of them.

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:24.830
About six years later, another
big, life changing lesson

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:29.750
came in also a small package,
and that was a baby piglet.

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.330
My local high school in
this farming community

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.220
had an agriculture class.

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.384
And the teacher of that class,
Mr. Jenkins, was a pig farmer.

00:03:38.384 --> 00:03:39.800
And it came time
in the curriculum

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.230
where they were going to
do a dissection project,

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.020
and Mr. Jenkins decided
that he would kill some baby

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:46.190
piglets on his farm.

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.520
He raised over 10,000
pigs, a large operation.

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.760
He arrived one May
morning in 1999

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.330
with this bucket of
piglets to the classroom,

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:01.090
and when he got there, one of
the piglets was still alive.

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.790
A student in the class, who did
part-time work on Mr. Jenkins'

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.420
farm, walked over to the
bucket, picked up this piglet

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:12.800
by her hind legs, and slammed
her head first into the ground.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.410
Now, this piglet, which
you see right here

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.970
in these photographs,
didn't die.

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:20.769
She was determined to survive.

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:21.839
Her skull was fractured.

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:23.255
She was bleeding
out of her mouth.

00:04:23.255 --> 00:04:25.650
She was vocalizing in distress.

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.290
A few students, who were
just absolutely appalled

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:29.970
by what they had
witnessed, grabbed

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.880
this now dying animal,
left the classroom,

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.945
went down the hallway to
Molly Fearing's classroom--

00:04:35.945 --> 00:04:37.320
another teacher
in the school who

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.180
was known as being
the vegetarian who

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:40.750
cared about animals.

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.350
She left the school, went
to a local veterinarian,

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.810
and had this poor
piglet euthanized.

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.690
There was nothing they
could do to help her.

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.230
Molly's next stop was the
local Sheriff's department

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:55.020
where she filed an
animal cruelty complaint,

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.530
asking that charges be
brought, and they were.

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.090
The very first
day of that trial,

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.500
however, the cruelty
charges were dismissed.

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.730
And that's because in
Ohio, like most states,

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:09.450
if something is considered
standard agricultural practice,

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:11.840
it's exempt from
cruelty prosecution.

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.310
And the practice of slamming
baby piglets head first

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:17.640
into the ground is considered
standard agricultural practice,

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.100
known as thumping in
the pork industry.

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:23.310
It is considered a
cheap and effective way

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:25.410
of killing animals.

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:28.440
Now this case, to
me as a 15-year-old,

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.270
illustrated that
there needed to be

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:33.120
an organization in my
local farming community

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.270
that would advocate on
behalf of these animals.

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:41.070
It was clear to me, had
this been a puppy or kitten,

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:43.500
the outcome would have
been completely different.

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.530
The cruelty charges
would have stuck,

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:49.260
and the teacher would
have been referred

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.840
for psychiatric
evaluation, perhaps banned

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.150
from ever having animals again.

00:05:54.150 --> 00:06:01.490
But because it was a pig, the
outcome was very different.

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:03.510
So I started Mercy for Animals.

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:05.330
We had no money, no resources.

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:07.100
I had no idea what
I was doing, but I

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:09.590
had a passion to right
a wrong and give a voice

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:11.510
to these animals who suffer.

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:15.380
Today, Mercy for Animals works
in four main program areas.

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:17.810
The first, undercover
investigation-- sending people

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:20.000
into factory farms
and slaughterhouses,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.920
wired with pinhole-sized
hidden cameras,

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:25.100
to document what takes
place behind the closed

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:27.320
doors of industrial
factory farms,

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:30.260
hatcheries, livestock auctions,
when the industry doesn't

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.060
think that it is being watched.

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:34.560
And I'll talk more
about that later.

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:38.210
We also work through legal
advocacy, changing laws,

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:40.850
pushing on a federal level,
but also on a state level

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:43.680
to outlaw the worst
factory farm practices.

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.830
Through corporate outreach,
pushing the largest

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:48.350
corporations in this country--
everyone from Wal-Mart

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:51.680
to McDonald's-- to also abandon
the cruelest factory farm

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:52.380
practices.

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:55.250
And finally, through consumer
education and awareness

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:56.120
campaigns--

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:58.220
informing people on
the fact that animals

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:00.890
are individuals with unique
minds and personalities.

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:02.630
Their lives matter,
the treatment of them

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:06.050
matters, and that our
food choices also matter.

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:08.919
And moving towards a vegan
diet, moving away from animals

00:07:08.919 --> 00:07:09.710
and towards plants.

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:15.750
This incident taught
me at a young age

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:19.260
that we all have power.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:20.940
Just the fact that
we were born human

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:22.650
puts us in a place of power.

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:25.050
To be in a time
and a country where

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:30.510
we are able to speak
freely also gives us power.

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:32.250
And Mercy for
Animals has been one

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:34.620
of the most empowering
experiences of my life,

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:38.460
being able to advocate on
those who have no voice.

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:40.200
Dr. King once said
that our lives

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:44.310
begin to end the day that we
become silent about things

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:46.164
that matter.

00:07:46.164 --> 00:07:47.580
So I want to talk
about people who

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:51.420
are using their place of power
to help animals and speak out

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:53.790
about things that matter.

00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:57.210
One such individual
is Dr. Jane Goodall.

00:07:57.210 --> 00:07:58.800
Now she says, we
have to understand

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:01.470
that we are not the only
beings on this planet

00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:03.470
with personalities and minds.

00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:06.600
Now, most of us are at least
somewhat familiar with the work

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:10.050
of Dr. Goodall, who
spent over 40 years

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:14.130
living with and observing
chimpanzees in Africa.

00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:16.740
Now, she started to do
this work at a time when

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:20.700
even the veterinary community
was not united in the belief

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:24.360
and understanding that all
animals felt physical pain, let

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:27.060
alone that they had rich
intellectual and emotional

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:28.170
lives.

00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:30.810
It was through
Dr. Goodall's work

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:34.380
that we started to understand
that many of the false barriers

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:36.059
and walls that we
put up between us

00:08:36.059 --> 00:08:38.580
and other animals were,
in fact, non-existent.

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:41.760
She witnessed and
documented animals

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:47.070
having culture, having
language, using tools, grieving

00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:48.810
for the loss of loved ones.

00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:56.240
This is an image that I think
really shows friendship,

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:58.130
and loyalty, and love.

00:08:58.130 --> 00:09:01.210
These are two dogs in China.

00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:03.080
Now, they were street dogs.

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:05.470
They never had a
human companion.

00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:07.730
They were never given
names by people.

00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:11.450
But to each other,
they meant everything.

00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:14.690
One afternoon,
the female was hit

00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:17.570
and she was killed by a car.

00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:22.520
Her loyal companion stayed
by her side for hours on end,

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:27.650
licking her face, nudging her,
dodging traffic to comfort her.

00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:32.600
This is, of course, just
one example of that bond.

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:35.120
And we live in a
country where half of us

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:37.310
share our homes
with dogs and cats.

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:39.200
And of those
animals, half of them

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:42.030
will receive gifts
this holiday season.

00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:44.810
We spend billions of
dollars on their care

00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:49.220
and toys and medical procedures,
yet we live in a country

00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:52.160
where billions, literally
billions of animals

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:54.590
suffer and die the
worst fate imaginable.

00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:57.590
And those, of course,
are farmed animals.

00:09:57.590 --> 00:09:59.240
And part of what
Mercy for Animals does

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:02.360
is help to bridge the
gap in our empathy

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:05.150
and our understanding
of animals,

00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:06.860
to widen our circle
of compassion

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:09.230
to include those that,
for all too long,

00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:13.240
have simply been labeled food.

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:17.080
This is another image that
tells a story of love.

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:19.810
This image is from India.

00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:25.420
This mother cow's baby was
hit and killed by a bus.

00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:29.760
For two years, she
stayed in the same area.

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:32.290
And every time that the bus
that hit and killed her baby

00:10:32.290 --> 00:10:36.460
came by, she would slowly
walk along it in front of it

00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:40.030
as if trying to prevent the bus
from killing any other animals.

00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:43.480
Now, the bus driver became
so frustrated by this

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:45.790
that he actually
painted the bus trying

00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:49.300
to disguise it and
fool this mother cow,

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:50.790
but she wasn't fooled.

00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:53.710
She remembered the face
of the man who drove

00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:55.660
the bus that killed her baby.

00:10:55.660 --> 00:11:00.460
So this, of course, shows
not only emotional empathy,

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:04.490
but also a prolonged
memory as well.

00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:06.970
Now, of course animals
tell us so much

00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:11.620
if we will just bother to
listen and watch and observe.

00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:13.660
And often times, science
is slow to catch up

00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:17.920
with what that would tell us,
but finally, that is happening.

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:21.940
Just a few years ago, hundreds
of the leading scientists

00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:25.870
signed the Cambridge
Declaration of Consciousness.

00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:28.840
And what this says is
that all animals are just

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:30.940
as conscious and
aware as humans.

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:32.650
And we're not just
talking about mammals.

00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:38.160
We're talking about birds,
fish, and even octopus.

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:40.500
This is a headline
just from the last week

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:42.210
that appeared in
"The New York Times."

00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:46.150
Fish depression is not a
joke, talking about depression

00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:49.080
in fish in captivity, where
they are kept in enclosures

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:50.520
with no stimulation.

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:55.190
So much so that fish are being
used to study antidepressants.

00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:57.860
This article from
"Smithsonian"--

00:11:57.860 --> 00:12:00.240
Fido's making that
puppy face on purpose.

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:03.640
He's trying to
tell you something.

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:05.150
And of course, this
all makes sense.

00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:09.580
When we think about our
singular place of life forming,

00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:11.980
of evolution beginning,
it makes sense

00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:14.320
that other animals
would remember

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:16.690
faces of friends and foes.

00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:17.950
It helps with their survival.

00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:21.460
Bonding and empathy also
helps with their survival.

00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:23.860
Not to mention, of course,
physical pain being

00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:27.010
necessary for their survival.

00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:29.110
But we have grown
so disconnected.

00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:31.960
We start to view ourselves as
different from other animals--

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:34.120
separate from.

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:37.210
But only 70,000 years ago,
there are at least six species

00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:39.100
of humans on this Earth--

00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:42.640
Neanderthals, Homo erectus,
[INAUDIBLE],, and others.

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:44.500
But about 10,000
years ago, things

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:48.040
started to change as we
domesticated plants and animals

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:50.830
in the Neolithic period,
and we started agriculture.

00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:54.100
We became stationary rather
than hunter or gatherers.

00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:56.170
And with that, we built walls--

00:12:56.170 --> 00:12:59.140
literal walls-- between
us and the natural world

00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:02.350
and our animal cousins.

00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:04.720
And that agriculture that
once sustained us and allowed

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:07.630
us to start civilization as
we know it in human history,

00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:11.500
as we know it, has
gone completely awry,

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:14.380
leading to factory
farms, other animals not

00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:16.450
being viewed as
sentient creatures,

00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:22.790
but as production units,
as machines, as resources.

00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:27.950
And I believe that we must shift
and have an ethical evolution

00:13:27.950 --> 00:13:29.570
that encompasses animals.

00:13:29.570 --> 00:13:32.030
And I think that this
quote from "The Economist"

00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:34.580
sums up that march forward well.

00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:37.250
It says, "Historically,
man has expanded

00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:40.610
the reach of his ethical
calculations, as ignorance

00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:43.850
and wants have receded, first
beyond family and tribe,

00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:46.820
later beyond religion,
race, and nation.

00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:48.470
Bringing other
species more fully

00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:50.960
into the range of
these decisions one day

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:56.380
may seem no more than
civilized behavior requires."

00:13:56.380 --> 00:14:00.430
And we are starting to see
this ethical march forward

00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:04.960
in our treatment of animals, in
our understanding of animals.

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:11.080
After over 130 years of
confining elephants, of ripping

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:14.290
them from their families,
capturing them in the wild,

00:14:14.290 --> 00:14:18.070
of beating tigers, Ringling
Brothers and Barnum and Bailey

00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:21.550
Circus, citing
declining attendance

00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:25.450
and new legal restrictions
against their acts,

00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:29.689
has permanently shut down.

00:14:29.689 --> 00:14:31.730
And we are starting to
see an increased awareness

00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:36.140
of the problems of keeping orcas
and dolphins in confinement

00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:38.750
at places like SeaWorld.

00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:40.490
And I predict in
the next few years,

00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:42.590
we will see similar
announcements

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:46.460
from SeaWorld and similar
aquatic parks that

00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:51.060
will also retire these animals
to oceanside sanctuaries.

00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:52.860
This just from the
last few weeks--

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:56.040
California puppy mill ban
will require pet stores

00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:58.560
to sell rescue animals.

00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:00.990
California becoming
the first state

00:15:00.990 --> 00:15:06.450
in the nation to
ban the sale of dogs

00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:11.280
from puppy mills in pet stores,
taking effect in January 2019.

00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:15.840
So there is a march forward
in our treatment of animals.

00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:18.510
But when we talk
about animals, we're

00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:21.530
really talking about
farmed animals,

00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:24.240
though they are the
most absent, the most

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:26.790
invisible from our scenario.

00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:30.120
We don't go home to
a pig-- most of us.

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:32.640
We don't share our homes
with them, but most of us

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:34.540
don't know them as individuals.

00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:39.540
But as this chart shows,
they really are the 99%.

00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:41.910
The yellow, showing the
number of farmed animals

00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:42.990
used in this country.

00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:44.910
The blue, animals and labs.

00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:46.170
Gray, shelters.

00:15:46.170 --> 00:15:48.760
And in black, clothing.

00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:51.080
Nearly 9 billion in
the US every year.

00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:54.370
That's about 300 every second.

00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:56.950
We're looking at
hundreds of billions

00:15:56.950 --> 00:16:00.310
on an international level when
you include aquatic life, which

00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:01.270
of course, we should.

00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:07.030
And this is what
most people really

00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:09.040
know about factory farming--

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:10.150
very little.

00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:12.010
And that is by design.

00:16:12.010 --> 00:16:13.630
Obviously, there
is so much money

00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:19.090
pumped into portraying this
false image that happy meat

00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:21.490
comes from happy animals.

00:16:21.490 --> 00:16:24.400
We are told, from children, that
hamburgers grow in hamburger

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:26.620
patches at McDonald's.

00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:29.020
And there is a concerted
effort by the meat industry

00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:31.060
to keep people in
the dark-- in fact,

00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:34.570
criminalize even taking
photographs inside

00:16:34.570 --> 00:16:36.430
of factory farms
and slaughterhouses,

00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:39.430
further pulling
the curtain closed.

00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:41.110
But at Mercy for
Animals, we believe

00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:43.651
that people have a right to know
where their food comes from.

00:16:43.651 --> 00:16:46.480
That animals have a right
to have their stories told.

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:50.350
And that's why we carry out
undercover investigations.

00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:53.320
And I talk about this
at length in my book,

00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:55.960
but I want to tell you
just a little bit about who

00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:58.930
these incredible
individuals are.

00:16:58.930 --> 00:17:02.020
On the left here is Pete.

00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:04.990
Pete is the most prolific
undercover investigator

00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:07.760
that the American animal
rights movement has ever seen.

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:11.240
He has been to over
400 puppy mills.

00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:13.240
He has been inside of
dozens of factory farms

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:15.550
and slaughterhouses, and
now does investigations

00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:17.859
on an international level.

00:17:17.859 --> 00:17:20.109
Liz, who you see
here in the middle,

00:17:20.109 --> 00:17:22.720
used to work at an
animal sanctuary,

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:26.349
but she knew that if she left
behind her friends and family

00:17:26.349 --> 00:17:27.819
and did undercover
investigation,

00:17:27.819 --> 00:17:29.800
she would be able to
help even more animals.

00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:31.030
And so she did that.

00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:33.760
In fact, her work
at Butterball Turkey

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:37.420
led to the first ever felony
conviction for cruelty

00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:39.280
to factory farm birds.

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:43.480
And on the right is Cody, who
is a former investigator who

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:46.900
has worked at the largest
dairy farm in New York,

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:48.970
leading to criminal
animal cruelty convictions

00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:52.030
and international policy
change, and at a pig factory

00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:53.880
farm in Pennsylvania.

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:58.270
And I want to tell you a
story from his work there.

00:17:58.270 --> 00:18:01.360
On his first day at this
breeding facility, where

00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:03.850
pigs are kept locked
in tiny crates

00:18:03.850 --> 00:18:06.880
where they can't turn around,
Cody opened the shed door

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:07.930
and stepped inside.

00:18:07.930 --> 00:18:11.110
And he saw mother
pigs with their babies

00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:12.970
in farrowing crates.

00:18:12.970 --> 00:18:16.300
But he noticed that one
of the cage doors was open

00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:19.840
and the mother was in the
hallway with her baby piglets

00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:21.640
behind her.

00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:24.610
And as he investigated
more, he realized

00:18:24.610 --> 00:18:28.480
that, in fact, two
other sows were also

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:32.920
free from their cage and their
piglets following behind.

00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:35.200
Cody asked other workers
what had happened.

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:37.150
They did some
investigating, and they

00:18:37.150 --> 00:18:41.080
determined that the one
mother sow had figured out

00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:45.430
how to use her tongue to
unlatch a pin in the cage door

00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:50.380
and liberate herself, and then
freed her piglets behind her.

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:52.210
But she didn't stop there.

00:18:52.210 --> 00:18:54.790
She opened the cage doors
of other suffering pigs

00:18:54.790 --> 00:18:55.840
around her.

00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:57.970
Now, they say that
the definition of love

00:18:57.970 --> 00:19:01.540
is having a benevolent
and unselfish concern

00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:03.490
for the good of another.

00:19:03.490 --> 00:19:06.610
If this isn't an act of
love, I don't know what is.

00:19:06.610 --> 00:19:11.500
It certainly is an act
of bravery and courage.

00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:13.990
Now, how was she
repaid for this?

00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:16.840
She was shot in the head
with a captive bolt gun.

00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:20.930
The farm says that once pigs
learn how to free themselves,

00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:22.970
they will continue to do
it time and time again.

00:19:26.884 --> 00:19:29.300
So that's just one story of
the bravery and courage that's

00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:31.239
happening right now
inside of factory farms.

00:19:31.239 --> 00:19:33.530
We talked about the physical
pain that animals endure--

00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:36.800
and we should-- but there's
also emotional distress

00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:39.290
that these animals are
subjected to as well.

00:19:39.290 --> 00:19:43.640
At Mercy for Animals, we
focus on doing the most good

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:44.330
that we can.

00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:47.450
We realize that we have limited
time, resources, and energy.

00:19:47.450 --> 00:19:50.930
So we want to help as
much as we possibly

00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:54.320
can, save as many lives,
reduce as much suffering.

00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:56.120
So in our campaigns
and in our work,

00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:58.610
we look at the number of
animals affected, the duration

00:19:58.610 --> 00:20:01.070
of suffering, the
degree of suffering,

00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:04.550
and where there are
viable alternatives.

00:20:04.550 --> 00:20:08.410
And while we push forward
for a vegan world--

00:20:08.410 --> 00:20:10.290
and I'll talk more about that--

00:20:10.290 --> 00:20:12.290
we also believe that it's
our ethical obligation

00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:14.450
to prevent as much
suffering as we can

00:20:14.450 --> 00:20:16.760
for the animals
unfortunate enough to be

00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:19.620
born now and in the future.

00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:21.920
So part of that
includes changing laws

00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:25.490
and pushing for policy
changes, as I mentioned before.

00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:27.350
And we look at the
internationally accepted

00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:29.690
five freedoms as a
base for that work,

00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:31.610
and that's freedom
from hunger and thirst,

00:20:31.610 --> 00:20:35.309
freedom from discomfort, freedom
from pain, injury, and disease,

00:20:35.309 --> 00:20:37.100
freedom from fear and
distress, and freedom

00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:41.810
to express normal behavior.

00:20:41.810 --> 00:20:45.290
Simple terms, but vast impact.

00:20:45.290 --> 00:20:48.050
That means addressing
the intensive confinement

00:20:48.050 --> 00:20:50.750
of animals, like those mother
pigs that I just told you

00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:54.950
about, and ending
gestation crates,

00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:58.400
ending the confinement of egg
laying hens in battery cages--

00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:02.720
file cabinet-sized cages,
where five to seven birds are

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:05.304
kept for their entire lives,
unable to spread their wings,

00:21:05.304 --> 00:21:06.970
walk, perch, roost,
[INAUDIBLE],, bathe,

00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:09.260
or engage in the most
basic natural behaviors.

00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:12.800
It means ending the confinement
of baby calves inside

00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:15.620
of veal crates.

00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:17.180
And we're having success.

00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:19.130
We have pushed many of
the largest players--

00:21:19.130 --> 00:21:22.520
everyone from Wal-Mart to
McDonald's-- to address these

00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:23.160
abuses.

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:26.550
Now, this doesn't mean that
these animals live happy lives.

00:21:26.550 --> 00:21:28.340
And in fact, many
of these commitments

00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:31.040
have phase-in periods
of 10 years or more,

00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:33.470
but it is moving
the ball forward,

00:21:33.470 --> 00:21:35.870
showing that these
animals' lives matter,

00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:39.950
and that the treatment of them
during those lives matter.

00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:43.880
Our main focus right now
is on birds used for meat.

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:48.170
Broiler chickens-- literally
named after the cooking method.

00:21:48.170 --> 00:21:50.240
These are birds that
have been bred to be

00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:51.770
almost Frankenstein animals.

00:21:51.770 --> 00:21:53.900
Bred to grow so
large and so fast

00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:56.420
that they're killed when
they're 45 days old--

00:21:56.420 --> 00:21:58.170
babies.

00:21:58.170 --> 00:22:01.950
And they suffer under the
weight of their own bodies.

00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:04.590
There's not a single federal
law that provides protection

00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:07.560
to animals during their
lives on factory farms,

00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:09.390
and the only
federal laws that do

00:22:09.390 --> 00:22:13.020
exist are related to the
final moments of the animals

00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:14.370
lives-- transport and slaughter.

00:22:14.370 --> 00:22:19.020
And of that, they exempt
birds, which make up

00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:21.540
the 95% of farmed animals.

00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:24.540
So the way in which chickens are
killed in this country, that's

00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:27.160
considered standard and
legal, would be illegal

00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:31.330
if it was a dog or a
cat, and a cow or a pig.

00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:33.210
So we're working to
change that as well.

00:22:33.210 --> 00:22:36.814
These birds are dumped out of
crates, snapped into shackles.

00:22:36.814 --> 00:22:39.230
They have their throats slit
while they're fully conscious

00:22:39.230 --> 00:22:42.327
often times, and many of them
go into scalding tanks of water

00:22:42.327 --> 00:22:43.410
while they're still alive.

00:22:43.410 --> 00:22:45.880
The USDA says at least
a million birds a year,

00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:50.510
but we know that the number
is, in fact, much higher.

00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:53.660
So we're working to reduce
the suffering of these birds

00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:55.970
through pressuring
companies to change

00:22:55.970 --> 00:22:58.400
the genetics of these birds,
give them natural light,

00:22:58.400 --> 00:22:59.900
enrichments that
they have something

00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:02.300
to do during their
miserable existence,

00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:05.630
reduce stocking density, and
change slaughter practices.

00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:07.550
And in just the last
year, we've been

00:23:07.550 --> 00:23:10.520
able to pressure over
100 of the largest food

00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:13.040
companies in the world
to make these changes,

00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:17.180
affecting over 1 billion birds.

00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:20.040
But we're also addressing
this on the political front.

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:24.400
Now, there is no clear
roadmap right now

00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:27.050
for federal legislation
that would protect animals.

00:23:27.050 --> 00:23:28.954
So we have to look
at the state level.

00:23:28.954 --> 00:23:31.120
Half of the states don't
even have ballot initiative

00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:34.390
processes, but California does.

00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:37.810
And we are part of a coalition
that is launching right now.

00:23:37.810 --> 00:23:42.010
An initiative that would end
the cage confinement of birds,

00:23:42.010 --> 00:23:44.860
cows, and pigs in
California, but also

00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:48.070
the sale of meat and
eggs from birds that

00:23:48.070 --> 00:23:49.330
are kept in these enclosures.

00:23:49.330 --> 00:23:51.040
So if you're
interested, please go

00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:56.970
to preventcrueltyca.com to get
involved in that initiative.

00:23:56.970 --> 00:23:59.580
These efforts are
having a real impact,

00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:06.130
as I said-- impacting over
1 billion animals year-wide.

00:24:06.130 --> 00:24:11.870
$1 to MFA helps 111 animals--

00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:15.290
reduce the suffering of these
animals through policy changes,

00:24:15.290 --> 00:24:19.170
and spares one animal from ever
being born into factory farms.

00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:21.290
This is our view of
effective altruism.

00:24:21.290 --> 00:24:24.540
How can we stretch the dollar
to impact the most animals.

00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:26.660
Though again, we won't
meet these animals,

00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:29.390
but prevention goes so
far in helping them.

00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:32.630
We also believe that
where an animal is born,

00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:35.630
or where an animal
hatches, shouldn't dictate

00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:37.482
whether they live
lives of suffering

00:24:37.482 --> 00:24:38.690
or whether they have respect.

00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:41.930
We believe that a pig in
China and a pig in the US

00:24:41.930 --> 00:24:44.120
deserve the same sort
of consideration.

00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:47.660
That a chicken in Canada
or a chicken in Mexico

00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:51.050
deserve the same consideration.

00:24:51.050 --> 00:24:53.760
And while we make progress
here in the United States,

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:56.610
the truth is, is that only
about 2% of farmed animals

00:24:56.610 --> 00:24:57.900
are in the US.

00:24:57.900 --> 00:25:01.710
The other 98% are
on a global level--

00:25:01.710 --> 00:25:03.870
about half of this in China.

00:25:03.870 --> 00:25:07.380
And this includes
fish that are farmed.

00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:11.400
And unfortunately, we are seeing
an increase in meat consumption

00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:13.600
and production on
a global scale.

00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:18.150
In fact, it is estimated that
by 2050, global meat production

00:25:18.150 --> 00:25:19.290
will double.

00:25:19.290 --> 00:25:21.240
So we need to come up
with innovative ways

00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:25.905
to address this, which I'll
talk about a bit later.

00:25:25.905 --> 00:25:27.280
One way in which
we're doing this

00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:31.060
is by launching offices and
campaigns around the globe.

00:25:31.060 --> 00:25:35.410
We now have a presence in six
countries together representing

00:25:35.410 --> 00:25:38.290
over half of the global
human population.

00:25:38.290 --> 00:25:40.000
These are slides
of investigations

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:45.760
that we carried out in Mexico
at over a dozen government owned

00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:47.290
slaughterhouses.

00:25:47.290 --> 00:25:51.340
And we documented pigs
having their hearts cut

00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:55.340
open while still alive,
being electrically shocked,

00:25:55.340 --> 00:26:01.270
hammers being used to kill
adult cows and steers.

00:26:01.270 --> 00:26:03.760
Now, we used this
investigation to push

00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:05.870
for federal legislation.

00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:10.330
And I'm excited to say that it
is moving through the Mexico

00:26:10.330 --> 00:26:12.480
legislature as we speak.

00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:15.370
In just the last week, it passed
the equivalent of the House

00:26:15.370 --> 00:26:19.240
in Mexico, and it is now
going before the Senate.

00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:21.070
And we are optimistic
that it will pass

00:26:21.070 --> 00:26:23.440
and be signed by the president.

00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:25.450
And what this piece
of legislation does

00:26:25.450 --> 00:26:28.802
is make it a crime to slit the
throat of animals while still

00:26:28.802 --> 00:26:30.010
conscious in slaughterhouses.

00:26:30.010 --> 00:26:35.820
Currently, it is not
illegal to do so in Mexico.

00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:38.040
But we're also addressing
this at the core,

00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:41.820
which is consumer demand for
meat, dairy, and egg products.

00:26:41.820 --> 00:26:44.040
Now, we have a lot of
consumer education campaigns

00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:46.290
that go directly to
consumers, but we also

00:26:46.290 --> 00:26:49.500
are doing institutional
meat reduction work.

00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:52.530
And a lot of this
is in Latin America,

00:26:52.530 --> 00:26:54.810
where we work with
schools to carry

00:26:54.810 --> 00:26:58.470
a vegan only meal that
they carry one day a week--

00:26:58.470 --> 00:27:00.000
completely vegan.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.680
And just since launching this
program a few months ago,

00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:05.520
we've had over a dozen
successes leading

00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:09.390
to a total of 25
million vegan meals

00:27:09.390 --> 00:27:11.710
a year being served
through these schools.

fellow earthlings.

Connected and alike through
this shared experience

00:27:31.039 --> 00:27:41.720
called life through love,
companionship, joy, family,

00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:47.940
and a desire to be free,
but we've lost our way

00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:50.880
and betrayed the animals.

00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:54.990
We have abused our power.

00:27:54.990 --> 00:28:00.440
We have dominated and hurt
our fellow earthlings.

00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:07.590
We have locked them in cages
and condemned them to death.

00:28:07.590 --> 00:28:10.550
Hearts broken.

00:28:10.550 --> 00:28:11.810
Families separated.

00:28:15.674 --> 00:28:19.055
Unseen, unheard.

00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:29.490
We must turn the tide toward
kindness and compassion.

00:28:29.490 --> 00:28:34.010
It is up to us to
expose the truth,

00:28:34.010 --> 00:28:42.380
confront cruelty, give a
voice to the voiceless,

00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:48.730
and change the world
for them, for all of us.

00:28:48.730 --> 00:28:54.600
Together, we can inspire
compassion, stop the violence,

00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:58.250
and bring about a
revolution of love.

00:28:58.250 --> 00:29:04.100
Together, we can create
a world without cages,

00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:10.680
a world without factory farming
or slaughterhouses, a world

00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:17.080
without cruelty, a world where
our fellow earthlings are free

00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:17.580
again.

00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:27.866

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:42.670
NATHAN RUNKLE: So
how do we build

00:29:42.670 --> 00:29:44.740
this compassionate future?

00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:50.500
To do that, I want to start
by talking about Henry Ford.

00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:53.500
If we look about 100
years ago, the streets

00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:57.280
were crowded with horses,
overworked horses that

00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:00.460
were pulling carriages
in the blistering heat

00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:02.230
and the freezing temperature.

00:30:02.230 --> 00:30:05.170
And there were people advocating
on behalf of these horses

00:30:05.170 --> 00:30:06.850
and the better
treatment of them.

00:30:06.850 --> 00:30:11.990
But what truly changed the game
was something better, faster,

00:30:11.990 --> 00:30:13.010
more efficient.

00:30:13.010 --> 00:30:15.580
And that was, of
course, the Model T.

00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:19.150
History is crowded
with examples of this.

00:30:19.150 --> 00:30:22.730
We can look at what helped
drive down the whaling industry.

00:30:22.730 --> 00:30:24.280
And yes, it was
international outcry,

00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:26.740
but it was also kerosene
and other forms of oil.

00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:29.800
If we look at what's happening
right here in Silicon

00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:32.440
Valley, how
innovation is changing

00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:36.010
the way in which people
travel, where they stay,

00:30:36.010 --> 00:30:37.900
how they gather
information, we can

00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:42.620
see that simple ideas
can change the world.

00:30:42.620 --> 00:30:44.500
And I believe that
animal agriculture

00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:48.250
is ripe for this
type of disruption.

00:30:48.250 --> 00:30:52.580
Not only is it inhumane, but
it is completely inefficient.

00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:55.480
We think about the amount
of grain and energy

00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:58.270
that has to be used to produce
that grain to funnel it

00:30:58.270 --> 00:31:01.150
through animals to get
a small amount of meat,

00:31:01.150 --> 00:31:02.710
it doesn't make sense.

00:31:02.710 --> 00:31:03.790
It's not sustainable.

00:31:03.790 --> 00:31:08.560
As we race towards a global
population of 9.7 billion

00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:15.570
by 2050, we simply can't
grow and feed enough animals

00:31:15.570 --> 00:31:18.010
to feed the growing population.

00:31:18.010 --> 00:31:19.940
Now, Richard Branson
recently said,

00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:22.210
"I believe that
in 30 years or so,

00:31:22.210 --> 00:31:25.180
we will no longer need
to kill any animals,

00:31:25.180 --> 00:31:28.630
and that all meat will either
be clean or plant-based,

00:31:28.630 --> 00:31:32.830
taste the same, and also be
much healthier for everyone."

00:31:32.830 --> 00:31:35.500
And Mr. Branson
is a new investor

00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:40.720
in Memphis Meats, a company that
was founded by Uma Valeti, who

00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:42.230
is a cardiologist.

00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:45.070
He was saving
lives in hospitals,

00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:48.520
and he realized that in
the medical profession,

00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:50.470
they were growing
tissues for quite

00:31:50.470 --> 00:31:52.130
some time for medical purposes.

00:31:52.130 --> 00:31:56.380
And he thought, can't we use
this same technology to raise

00:31:56.380 --> 00:31:58.270
meat-- meat without the murder--

00:31:58.270 --> 00:32:00.880
something that Google
has been at the forefront

00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:03.310
of, with Sergey Brin,
of course, funding

00:32:03.310 --> 00:32:07.630
the first lab-grown burger
from Mark Post just a number

00:32:07.630 --> 00:32:09.070
of years ago.

00:32:09.070 --> 00:32:11.560
Now, Uma started
Memphis Meats, and it's

00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:13.750
called Memphis Meats because
one of his co-founders

00:32:13.750 --> 00:32:17.680
is from Memphis and actually
owns and runs barbecue meat

00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:20.740
restaurants there and would
like to have clean meat

00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:24.340
to be able to serve in
his restaurants one day.

00:32:24.340 --> 00:32:27.010
Now Uma and his
team have created

00:32:27.010 --> 00:32:29.890
the world's first clean
meatball, but also

00:32:29.890 --> 00:32:34.480
the world's first clean
chicken and duck products just

00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:37.210
in the last few years.

00:32:37.210 --> 00:32:40.750
And it is called clean meat
as a nod to clean energy.

00:32:40.750 --> 00:32:45.730
It takes about 50% less
energy to produce clean meat,

00:32:45.730 --> 00:32:49.330
and produces about 90% less
greenhouse gas emissions,

00:32:49.330 --> 00:32:56.480
requires 90% less land
and water as well.

00:32:56.480 --> 00:33:00.510
But it's also called clean meat
because it is literally cleaner

00:33:00.510 --> 00:33:05.010
to produce in bioreactors,
much the same way

00:33:05.010 --> 00:33:06.190
that beer is produced.

00:33:06.190 --> 00:33:09.930
So you're not going to find
the same levels of bacteria

00:33:09.930 --> 00:33:10.710
contamination--

00:33:10.710 --> 00:33:14.010
E. Coli, salmonella,
campylobacter, et cetera.

00:33:14.010 --> 00:33:18.990
This chart shows Memphis
Meats' antibiotic and bacteria

00:33:18.990 --> 00:33:22.200
levels compared to conventional
and organic levels.

00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:24.970
It's pretty clear.

00:33:24.970 --> 00:33:27.370
"The Guardian's"
headline sums it up.

00:33:27.370 --> 00:33:31.150
They said, "Lab-grown food--
the goal is to remove the animal

00:33:31.150 --> 00:33:32.890
from meat production."

00:33:32.890 --> 00:33:36.190
And Uma considers this
the second domestication.

00:33:36.190 --> 00:33:37.922
The first domestication--

00:33:37.922 --> 00:33:39.880
10,000 years ago, the
Neolithic period, which I

00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:41.170
mentioned before.

00:33:41.170 --> 00:33:44.560
This being cellular
agriculture, a reflection

00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:46.720
of not only our
ethical evolution,

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:50.530
but also our increased
understanding of science

00:33:50.530 --> 00:33:53.200
and being able to cut
animals out of the equation

00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:55.450
and get right to the
heart of the matter.

00:33:58.030 --> 00:34:01.210
I believe so firmly
in the ability

00:34:01.210 --> 00:34:04.660
for clean meat and plant-based
meat to revolutionize the way

00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:07.000
that we eat, and in the
process, eliminate factory

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.610
farming that I helped start
The Good Food Institute,

00:34:09.610 --> 00:34:11.770
which you heard a
little bit about before.

00:34:11.770 --> 00:34:13.600
This is a nonprofit
that supports

00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:15.760
the entire plant-based
and clean meat

00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:20.710
sector by supporting scientists
and technology, innovation,

00:34:20.710 --> 00:34:23.409
and policy work, making sure
that when clean meat comes

00:34:23.409 --> 00:34:27.429
to market, that it won't face
any legal hurdles and community

00:34:27.429 --> 00:34:28.929
engagement.

00:34:28.929 --> 00:34:31.389
Also, starting new crop
capital-- putting our money

00:34:31.389 --> 00:34:32.710
where our mouth is.

00:34:32.710 --> 00:34:36.250
Doing angel seed investing
in companies that are high

00:34:36.250 --> 00:34:39.040
risk, but have the potential
to change the world.

00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:42.940
Investing in companies, like
Memphis Meats, Beyond Meat,

00:34:42.940 --> 00:34:45.370
Lyrical Foods, Good Catch--

00:34:45.370 --> 00:34:48.400
companies that are
seeking to create vegan,

00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:50.860
plant-based
alternatives to fish.

00:34:50.860 --> 00:34:56.250
We are racing towards having
a fishless ocean by 2048,

00:34:56.250 --> 00:35:00.320
with most of the wild
stocks in severe decline.

00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:03.190
This is a moral and
ethical issue as much

00:35:03.190 --> 00:35:08.480
as it is a conservation and
environmental issue as well.

00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:13.160
And we have good company
with these investments

00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:17.200
that we are making-- perhaps
unusual, you might think.

00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:20.030
The Tyson Foods CEO says
that the future of food

00:35:20.030 --> 00:35:23.780
might be meatless, reflecting
a 5% investment that they

00:35:23.780 --> 00:35:27.050
recently did in Beyond Meat.

00:35:27.050 --> 00:35:29.810
Cargill, one of the largest
meat companies in the US,

00:35:29.810 --> 00:35:34.610
recently did an investment
alongside Bill Gates and others

00:35:34.610 --> 00:35:36.840
in Memphis Meats itself.

00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:39.890
This is something
that I welcome.

00:35:39.890 --> 00:35:45.100
Just as the car changed
the transportation sector,

00:35:45.100 --> 00:35:46.850
we believe that
plant-based and clean meat

00:35:46.850 --> 00:35:49.320
can change the protein sector.

00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:52.760
So we want companies in the
protein sector to embrace this,

00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:54.620
make this part of
their business plan.

00:35:54.620 --> 00:36:00.890
And we are seeing that happen
at an alarmingly great rate.

00:36:00.890 --> 00:36:03.890
Now, I want to talk a little
bit about change over time.

00:36:03.890 --> 00:36:06.410
Just a few years ago,
people would say clean meat,

00:36:06.410 --> 00:36:09.260
ending factory farming,
this is crazy talk,

00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:10.970
it's never going to happen.

00:36:10.970 --> 00:36:14.510
This is too deeply ingrained
in our culture and our beliefs,

00:36:14.510 --> 00:36:17.240
but a little bit of
historical perspective I think

00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:19.880
can show how quickly
things can change.

00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:23.060
Dr. King once said that the
arc of the moral universe

00:36:23.060 --> 00:36:26.400
is long, but bends
towards justice.

00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:28.340
And this is true.

00:36:28.340 --> 00:36:31.430
Our history books are filled
with examples of this.

00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:33.050
But that arc of
the moral universe,

00:36:33.050 --> 00:36:35.390
it doesn't bend on its own.

00:36:35.390 --> 00:36:37.550
It doesn't bend because
of the weight of time.

00:36:37.550 --> 00:36:41.570
It bends because thoughtful,
committed, concerned people

00:36:41.570 --> 00:36:44.390
step up to the plate
and they take action,

00:36:44.390 --> 00:36:46.820
whether that's protesting,
speaking out, founding

00:36:46.820 --> 00:36:50.120
organizations, supporting
organizations, or being

00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:53.150
innovators in the space.

00:36:53.150 --> 00:36:57.920
Just 150 years ago, we ended
slavery in this country--

00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:00.170
owning another human,
considering them

00:37:00.170 --> 00:37:02.870
as chattel and property.

00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:07.570
97 years ago, women were
finally given the right to vote.

00:37:07.570 --> 00:37:09.460
There were impassioned
debates in Congress

00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:12.070
about women being too
irrational of creatures

00:37:12.070 --> 00:37:14.290
to be able to vote.

00:37:14.290 --> 00:37:19.270
Funny considering
the situation today.

00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:22.840
Just 53 years ago,
we ended segregation

00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:27.450
in this country-- something
that was fought tooth and nail.

00:37:27.450 --> 00:37:30.900
Just 50 years ago, in
Loving versus Virginia,

00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:34.200
interracial marriage was
legalized across the United

00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:36.240
States, striking
down certain state

00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:37.560
laws that made it a crime.

00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:40.290
People were arrested
in their own homes

00:37:40.290 --> 00:37:42.970
because of who they loved.

00:37:42.970 --> 00:37:46.540
And just two years ago,
my love, and others

00:37:46.540 --> 00:37:49.930
in the LGBT community, finally
recognized in our country

00:37:49.930 --> 00:37:55.830
on a national level with
the Supreme Court decision.

00:37:55.830 --> 00:37:58.510
Now, when I grew up
on a farm in Ohio,

00:37:58.510 --> 00:38:02.610
I was called a faggot before I
knew what the word even meant.

00:38:02.610 --> 00:38:04.770
And I was taught
and told by society

00:38:04.770 --> 00:38:07.990
that my love wasn't equal, and
I can tell you, at a young age,

00:38:07.990 --> 00:38:11.220
there were many times when
I thought that I would never

00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:12.390
be able to get married.

00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:14.910
That society would never
progress to a point

00:38:14.910 --> 00:38:16.170
where that would happen.

00:38:16.170 --> 00:38:18.830
And I can only imagine,
when people like Rosa Parks

00:38:18.830 --> 00:38:21.480
are being dragged off of
buses, that they probably

00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:24.150
didn't know when
or if they would

00:38:24.150 --> 00:38:26.830
see those changes
in their lifetime,

00:38:26.830 --> 00:38:28.530
but they pushed forward.

00:38:28.530 --> 00:38:32.650
And society is
better because of it.

00:38:32.650 --> 00:38:36.640
Nelson Mandela who was a
political prisoner, released,

00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:39.880
and became the president
of South Africa, once

00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:44.540
said, "It always seems
impossible until it's done."

00:38:44.540 --> 00:38:45.804
And then it seems inevitable.

00:38:45.804 --> 00:38:47.470
And again, we can
look at history books,

00:38:47.470 --> 00:38:50.157
and we can say, of
course, slavery would end.

00:38:50.157 --> 00:38:52.240
Of course, women would be
given the right to vote.

00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:55.270
Of course,
segregation would end.

00:38:55.270 --> 00:38:58.160
But again, it didn't
happen on its own.

00:38:58.160 --> 00:39:00.880
Now Peter Singer, author
of "Animal Liberation"

00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:04.720
and many other wonderful books,
once said it's easy for us

00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:08.350
to criticize the prejudices
of our grandfathers

00:39:08.350 --> 00:39:12.440
from which they freed
themselves from their fathers,

00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:15.610
but it is more difficult for
us to dispassionately search

00:39:15.610 --> 00:39:19.950
for prejudices in
our own beliefs.

00:39:19.950 --> 00:39:22.440
And I believe that
animal protection,

00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:26.130
animal rights is a
social justice issue.

00:39:26.130 --> 00:39:29.100
And if we look at the number of
individuals that are suffering

00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:31.330
and the degree to which
they are suffering,

00:39:31.330 --> 00:39:35.500
I think it is one of the most
pressing social justice issues.

00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:40.890
And it is different from other
past movements in the sense

00:39:40.890 --> 00:39:43.650
that those who are being
oppressed and marginalized,

00:39:43.650 --> 00:39:46.020
they can't speak up
on their own behalf.

00:39:46.020 --> 00:39:49.000
They can't stand up here
and share their stories.

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:51.810
They can't lobby
Congress to pass laws.

00:39:51.810 --> 00:39:54.030
They can't organize boycotts.

00:39:54.030 --> 00:39:56.190
They rely on each
and every one of us

00:39:56.190 --> 00:40:00.120
to do that on their behalf in
our own unique and meaningful

00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:01.980
ways.

00:40:01.980 --> 00:40:04.840
But if we stop for a moment
and we look and we listen,

00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:07.730
we see that these
animals are protesting.

00:40:07.730 --> 00:40:09.040
They are struggling.

00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:11.800
They are trying to save their
own lives and often times,

00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:14.140
the lives of others
that they care about.

00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:18.580
This is an image from China
of a brave pig who jumped out

00:40:18.580 --> 00:40:20.710
of the top of a
moving transport truck

00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:23.920
on her way to slaughter
to save her own life.

00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:26.510
And it seems like every few
weeks, every few months,

00:40:26.510 --> 00:40:29.470
we see stories in
the paper of animals

00:40:29.470 --> 00:40:32.350
who jumped over fences to save
themselves from slaughter.

00:40:32.350 --> 00:40:35.826
And when that happens, everyone
rallies behind those animals.

00:40:35.826 --> 00:40:36.950
They want them to be saved.

00:40:36.950 --> 00:40:39.900
They want them to
go to sanctuaries.

00:40:39.900 --> 00:40:41.470
Each animal deserves that.

00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:48.080
I just want to share this story,
which I'm sure many of you

00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:49.430
have heard before.

00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:53.630
A little boy is at the
beach with his grandfather,

00:40:53.630 --> 00:40:55.460
and there are hundreds
of starfish that

00:40:55.460 --> 00:40:57.770
have washed up along the shore.

00:40:57.770 --> 00:41:00.920
And the little boy is tossing
them back into the water, one

00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:01.880
after the next.

00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:06.860
And his grandfather looks at him
and says, what are you doing?

00:41:06.860 --> 00:41:09.050
There are maybe thousands
of starfish here.

00:41:09.050 --> 00:41:11.090
You can't possibly
save them all.

00:41:11.090 --> 00:41:14.180
And the little boy smiles
back at his grandfather.

00:41:14.180 --> 00:41:15.110
He reaches down.

00:41:15.110 --> 00:41:17.615
He picks up another starfish
and gently tosses him back

00:41:17.615 --> 00:41:18.240
into the water.

00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:21.620
And he said, it
matters to this one.

00:41:21.620 --> 00:41:23.949
And he reaches back down,
picks up another one,

00:41:23.949 --> 00:41:25.490
puts him back in
the water, and says,

00:41:25.490 --> 00:41:28.060
and it matters to this one.

00:41:28.060 --> 00:41:32.880
And to me, this story
really illustrates the power

00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:36.300
that we have to save
lives, to prevent cruelty,

00:41:36.300 --> 00:41:38.040
to improve the world.

00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:44.220
And how any act of kindness is
never wasted in little choices

00:41:44.220 --> 00:41:45.330
that we make.

00:41:45.330 --> 00:41:47.520
Maybe it's the food
choices that we

00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:51.600
make that can have profound
consequences for animals.

00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:55.844
It can be the difference
between life or death.

00:41:55.844 --> 00:41:58.260
So I leave you with this quote
from Harriet Beecher Stowe.

00:41:58.260 --> 00:41:59.370
She said, it's a
matter of taking

00:41:59.370 --> 00:42:01.260
the side of the weak
against the strong--

00:42:01.260 --> 00:42:03.780
something the best
people have always done.

00:42:03.780 --> 00:42:06.390
And it is difficult to
imagine a group of individuals

00:42:06.390 --> 00:42:11.310
who are weaker and more
vulnerable than animals.

00:42:11.310 --> 00:42:14.010
And within that
group, farmed animals.

00:42:14.010 --> 00:42:16.830
So thank you for being
here and for being

00:42:16.830 --> 00:42:20.551
on the side of the
weak and vulnerable.

00:42:20.551 --> 00:42:23.960
[APPLAUSE]

00:42:29.330 --> 00:42:32.220
Do we have time for questions?

00:42:32.220 --> 00:42:35.780
AUDIENCE: So, we see things
like "Happy Feet," where

00:42:35.780 --> 00:42:39.290
an animal's communicating
with the world, and we all

00:42:39.290 --> 00:42:41.600
[INAUDIBLE],, but I feel
like they communicate

00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:43.360
with us all of the time.

00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:47.690
So what, for instance, from
connecting our emotions

00:42:47.690 --> 00:42:50.730
that we have for our pets
with all of the other animals

00:42:50.730 --> 00:42:52.032
that we see in the world?

00:42:52.032 --> 00:42:53.840
I know some of it is
a bit brainwashing,

00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:56.094
but what inherently
is preventing us

00:42:56.094 --> 00:42:57.260
from making that connection?

00:42:57.260 --> 00:42:58.100
I don't understand.

00:42:58.100 --> 00:43:00.980
NATHAN RUNKLE: Yeah, I mean,
on this sort of brainwashing,

00:43:00.980 --> 00:43:04.170
Melanie Joy has written a book--

00:43:04.170 --> 00:43:05.720
well, she's written three books.

00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:11.720
One is called "Why We Eat Pigs,
Wear Cows, and Love Dogs."

00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:13.460
And she talks about
carnism, which

00:43:13.460 --> 00:43:19.010
is this invisible belief that
allows us to eat some animals,

00:43:19.010 --> 00:43:19.760
but not others.

00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:22.550
And the truth is that we
don't eat most animal species.

00:43:22.550 --> 00:43:26.100
It's actually a very small
number of cows, pigs, chickens,

00:43:26.100 --> 00:43:28.400
turkeys, ducks.

00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:34.400
And it really is a belief system
that allows us to do that.

00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:40.970
I think that part of it is that
it is social conditioning that

00:43:40.970 --> 00:43:43.814
is reinforced all
the time, and we

00:43:43.814 --> 00:43:45.980
don't know that we're being
conditioned in that way.

00:43:45.980 --> 00:43:47.900
It starts at a very
young age, especially

00:43:47.900 --> 00:43:52.470
in the United States
and Western cultures.

00:43:52.470 --> 00:43:55.460
So I think part of it is
that these animals are

00:43:55.460 --> 00:43:57.500
sort of ghosts in our
industrial machine.

00:43:57.500 --> 00:43:58.670
People don't see them.

00:43:58.670 --> 00:44:02.330
You go to the grocery store and
you pick up a package of meat

00:44:02.330 --> 00:44:05.405
and it doesn't resemble an
animal, and we call it beef

00:44:05.405 --> 00:44:07.340
or we call it pork.

00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:08.810
So I think that's
a big part of it,

00:44:08.810 --> 00:44:12.739
is people are able to have
willful ignorance that they

00:44:12.739 --> 00:44:14.780
don't want to know about
something so they're not

00:44:14.780 --> 00:44:16.300
going to.

00:44:16.300 --> 00:44:20.330
And I think that that is
one of the driving forces.

00:44:20.330 --> 00:44:22.467
And there's also just
so many social norms.

00:44:22.467 --> 00:44:24.050
People don't even
realize that they're

00:44:24.050 --> 00:44:26.820
making a choice so much.

00:44:26.820 --> 00:44:29.840
So I think that that's one
of the most important things,

00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:33.380
is as plant-based eating,
as vegan eating becomes more

00:44:33.380 --> 00:44:36.410
mainstream, and people
see others doing it

00:44:36.410 --> 00:44:40.829
and it becomes a default
option, that will go a long way.

00:44:40.829 --> 00:44:42.870
But part of what we want
to do with The Good Food

00:44:42.870 --> 00:44:46.840
Institute, for example, is the
three main factors for people

00:44:46.840 --> 00:44:50.150
in their eating is
convenience, taste, and price.

00:44:50.150 --> 00:44:53.390
So we want to make the
compassionate choice

00:44:53.390 --> 00:44:55.520
the default choice
so that maybe we

00:44:55.520 --> 00:44:57.710
don't need to win over
everyone's hearts and minds,

00:44:57.710 --> 00:44:59.640
but they can simply
go to a store

00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:00.980
and that's what they're eating.

00:45:00.980 --> 00:45:04.550
And maybe it's clean
meat and it's real meat,

00:45:04.550 --> 00:45:07.050
it's just produced
in a different way.

00:45:07.050 --> 00:45:09.600
So I think that that's
really exciting,

00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:11.390
and I think, honestly,
the way that we're

00:45:11.390 --> 00:45:14.660
going to drive down consumption
as quickly as we can.

00:45:14.660 --> 00:45:15.430
Yeah, thank you.

00:45:16.091 --> 00:45:18.340
AUDIENCE: Do you have a list,
or some sort of resource

00:45:18.340 --> 00:45:22.470
where you have
meat producers that

00:45:22.470 --> 00:45:25.381
do use humane processes today?

00:45:25.381 --> 00:45:26.380
NATHAN RUNKLE: We don't.

00:45:26.380 --> 00:45:28.430
So Mercy for Animals
is never going

00:45:28.430 --> 00:45:31.490
to endorse a meat company.

00:45:31.490 --> 00:45:34.040
Like I said, we think
the only compassionate

00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:35.280
choice is a plant-based diet.

00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:38.870
But as I said before,
we believe that it's

00:45:38.870 --> 00:45:42.160
our obligation to prevent as
much suffering as possible.

00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:44.480
So that means pushing companies
away from this process.

00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:45.980
So we don't have a
list of companies

00:45:45.980 --> 00:45:48.410
that we endorse,
and we never will.

00:45:48.410 --> 00:45:52.900
But there are different
labeling programs that are used.

00:45:52.900 --> 00:45:57.350
And people who aren't yet ready
to go completely plant based,

00:45:57.350 --> 00:45:59.720
I think the best thing you
can do is eat less meat.

00:45:59.720 --> 00:46:01.580
I think a lot of
people will think,

00:46:01.580 --> 00:46:05.000
hey I don't identify as vegan,
I don't think I ever could.

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:06.170
That's OK.

00:46:06.170 --> 00:46:07.760
If everyone ate
meatless on Monday,

00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:10.440
a billion fewer animals
would be killed.

00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:13.850
And if people start moving in
that direction, it's better.

00:46:13.850 --> 00:46:15.802
So people, especially
as they are starting,

00:46:15.802 --> 00:46:17.510
shouldn't view this
as an all or nothing.

00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:20.600
Because when people do that,
oftentimes they do nothing.

00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:25.400
And we need people to make
choices that help animals.

00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:29.180
But the labels that are thrown
around can be so deceptive.

00:46:29.180 --> 00:46:32.000
For example, there's the
American Humane Association,

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:37.390
which certifies Foster Farms
chicken and Butterball.

00:46:37.390 --> 00:46:40.160
It's essentially a completely
meaningless program.

00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:43.040
It really just rubber stamps
what the industry is already

00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:44.060
doing.

00:46:44.060 --> 00:46:46.370
And we've seen this
with the egg industry.

00:46:46.370 --> 00:46:49.560
A few years ago, they started
Animal Care Certified labeling,

00:46:49.560 --> 00:46:53.840
which meant they took one bird
out of each cage, that's it.

00:46:53.840 --> 00:46:55.790
The Better Business
Bureau got involved,

00:46:55.790 --> 00:46:57.300
they said this is misleading.

00:46:57.300 --> 00:47:00.230
So they change it to United
Egg Producer certified.

00:47:00.230 --> 00:47:02.680
So the industry knows that
people care about this.

00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:05.930
There's a lot of humane
washing that's happening.

00:47:05.930 --> 00:47:08.379
So if you are going to
choose to eat these products,

00:47:08.379 --> 00:47:09.920
I think at the very
least, you should

00:47:09.920 --> 00:47:11.450
know what the labels mean.

00:47:11.450 --> 00:47:13.880
Because they can vary so much.

00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:17.070
And you just need to do
your own research on that.

00:47:17.070 --> 00:47:20.840
I know that there is Farm
Forward, an organization that

00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:25.460
works on animal welfare
issues for food,

00:47:25.460 --> 00:47:28.370
has a website called
buyingpoultry.com,

00:47:28.370 --> 00:47:32.570
where they try to
aggregate that information

00:47:32.570 --> 00:47:34.502
in one place for people.

00:47:34.502 --> 00:47:36.460
AUDIENCE: Have you faced
any sort of resistance

00:47:36.460 --> 00:47:37.670
from the meat industry?

00:47:37.670 --> 00:47:41.600
Have there been any instances
of [INAUDIBLE] from them?

00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:43.160
NATHAN RUNKLE: No, they love me.

00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:46.490
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:46.490 --> 00:47:49.340
We're best friends.

00:47:49.340 --> 00:47:50.660
Yeah, I mean of course.

00:47:50.660 --> 00:47:52.230
So I think a number of things.

00:47:52.230 --> 00:47:56.650
One is they are trying
to make it a crime for us

00:47:56.650 --> 00:47:58.000
to do investigations.

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:04.990
So around 2011, a new wave of
ag-gag bills were introduced.

00:48:04.990 --> 00:48:07.360
Agriculture gag
bills, a term coined

00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:10.780
by Mark Bittman, who was at "The
New York Times" at the time.

00:48:10.780 --> 00:48:13.030
These bills come
in three flavors.

00:48:13.030 --> 00:48:15.340
Some of them are outright
ban on video and photographs.

00:48:15.340 --> 00:48:17.020
Others relate to
job applications.

00:48:17.020 --> 00:48:19.090
Others relate to turning
all of your footage

00:48:19.090 --> 00:48:21.910
over to law enforcement
and no one else.

00:48:21.910 --> 00:48:24.760
But these have been heavily
pushed by the meat industry.

00:48:24.760 --> 00:48:28.310
And the dairy industry has
been very much behind them.

00:48:28.310 --> 00:48:34.210
So that's one of the big
pushbacks from the industry.

00:48:34.210 --> 00:48:36.860
But each company is
different, I will say.

00:48:36.860 --> 00:48:38.440
Every company is
run by individuals,

00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:39.790
so they have their own culture.

00:48:39.790 --> 00:48:42.550
And some companies,
including meat companies,

00:48:42.550 --> 00:48:44.050
when we've done
investigations, have

00:48:44.050 --> 00:48:47.810
responded by saying yes,
there is a problem here.

00:48:47.810 --> 00:48:49.450
Let's talk about
what some solutions

00:48:49.450 --> 00:48:53.200
are that we could implement,
that would make things better.

00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:56.230
So that is one outcome.

00:48:56.230 --> 00:48:59.500
Others, like Tyson,
and like Cargill,

00:48:59.500 --> 00:49:02.740
like I said, while they're
still doing horrible things

00:49:02.740 --> 00:49:06.750
for the animals they're
raising, are investing

00:49:06.750 --> 00:49:07.730
in these alternatives.

00:49:07.730 --> 00:49:08.380
Which is smart.

00:49:08.380 --> 00:49:10.421
You look at the energy
sector, and the smart ones

00:49:10.421 --> 00:49:11.800
are investing in green energy.

00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:15.550
You can either choose to
fight and change progress,

00:49:15.550 --> 00:49:18.710
or you can jump on board
and be a champion for it.

00:49:18.710 --> 00:49:21.620
So I think we're seeing
more and more of that.

00:49:21.620 --> 00:49:24.750
And I think that we'll
continue to see that trend.

00:49:24.750 --> 00:49:28.090
Again, these are companies
that really view themselves

00:49:28.090 --> 00:49:29.710
as protein companies.

00:49:29.710 --> 00:49:32.080
They're not in the business
of just torturing animals.

00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:34.570
That's the old way
of doing things,

00:49:34.570 --> 00:49:37.750
and they're doing
it as efficiently

00:49:37.750 --> 00:49:39.470
as they feel that they can.

00:49:39.470 --> 00:49:43.930
But I think that there really
won't be much of a choice

00:49:43.930 --> 00:49:45.980
but to move in this direction.

00:49:45.980 --> 00:49:49.230
The planet won't be able
to survive without it.

00:49:49.230 --> 00:49:51.530
AUDIENCE: So I have a
question from Menohar,

00:49:51.530 --> 00:49:54.375
what is being done to make
sure that Tyson, et cetera,

00:49:54.375 --> 00:49:57.440
will not gain enough shares
of these meatless ventures

00:49:57.440 --> 00:49:59.121
to prevent them from succeeding?

00:49:59.121 --> 00:50:01.120
Or to own the patents and
intellectual property,

00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:04.230
et cetera, or to negatively
control the activities

00:50:04.230 --> 00:50:06.450
of these ventures.

00:50:06.450 --> 00:50:09.450
NATHAN RUNKLE: Yeah,
that's a good question.

00:50:09.450 --> 00:50:11.100
So I'm not too
concerned about them

00:50:11.100 --> 00:50:13.110
trying to put these
places out of business.

00:50:13.110 --> 00:50:18.450
Again, I think the business
case for this is very strong.

00:50:18.450 --> 00:50:20.610
It can be far more efficient.

00:50:20.610 --> 00:50:22.350
So again, they're in
the protein space.

00:50:22.350 --> 00:50:24.690
They're not committed
to just continuing

00:50:24.690 --> 00:50:26.290
to slaughter animals.

00:50:26.290 --> 00:50:29.280
And if you look through
the history of, let's say,

00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:31.860
plant-based meat
alternatives, Gardein

00:50:31.860 --> 00:50:36.390
was recently purchased for
$150 million by Pinnacle Foods.

00:50:36.390 --> 00:50:39.090
That's actually increased
their distribution.

00:50:39.090 --> 00:50:42.360
That's actually gotten them into
more places, larger advertising

00:50:42.360 --> 00:50:43.650
budgets.

00:50:43.650 --> 00:50:45.330
We've seen this with lot of--

00:50:45.330 --> 00:50:47.739
Silk and other
dairy alternatives.

00:50:47.739 --> 00:50:49.530
They're being purchased
by dairy companies.

00:50:49.530 --> 00:50:52.200
And they're not trying to
shelve those, or push them away,

00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:54.840
they're actually
increasing their sales.

00:50:54.840 --> 00:50:56.350
These are for-profit businesses.

00:50:56.350 --> 00:50:58.590
They want to make money
where it can happen.

00:50:58.590 --> 00:51:03.360
So I'm not too
concerned about that.

00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:06.880
But the owners of those
companies, I'm sure,

00:51:06.880 --> 00:51:08.670
are keeping an eye on it.

00:51:08.670 --> 00:51:12.930
If you look at the innovators
in this space, many of them

00:51:12.930 --> 00:51:14.340
are mission driven.

00:51:14.340 --> 00:51:17.440
They want to help animals
and the environment, as well.

00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:19.565
AUDIENCE: How are you
working in the health area

00:51:19.565 --> 00:51:21.190
with information
that can help people

00:51:21.190 --> 00:51:25.220
stop eating meat without fear
of malnutrition, et cetera.

00:51:25.220 --> 00:51:27.690
NATHAN RUNKLE: Yes, and
this is a great question.

00:51:27.690 --> 00:51:31.440
We do touch some, on health.

00:51:31.440 --> 00:51:33.630
There's two approaches.

00:51:33.630 --> 00:51:36.447
We need to talk about the
why people should change

00:51:36.447 --> 00:51:38.280
their diet, but we also
need to equally talk

00:51:38.280 --> 00:51:40.380
about how people should
change their diet.

00:51:40.380 --> 00:51:42.030
Because if not, you
get a lot of people

00:51:42.030 --> 00:51:46.020
who agree in theory, that
plant-based eating is good,

00:51:46.020 --> 00:51:47.980
but they don't
know how to do it.

00:51:47.980 --> 00:51:49.920
So a lot of our
education work is

00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:53.516
done in providing people with
just the simple meal plans,

00:51:53.516 --> 00:51:55.140
and how to be healthy,
and all of that.

00:51:55.140 --> 00:51:57.810
So that's a big part
of those programs.

00:51:57.810 --> 00:51:59.910
We are an animal protection
organization, however,

00:51:59.910 --> 00:52:02.320
so we're not a health
care organization.

00:52:02.320 --> 00:52:04.080
So that's not our primary focus.

00:52:04.080 --> 00:52:06.630
That's not really where our
expertise and credibility

00:52:06.630 --> 00:52:07.380
comes in.

00:52:07.380 --> 00:52:09.390
But there are organizations
that are doing that,

00:52:09.390 --> 00:52:12.030
like Physicians Committee
for Responsible Medicine.

00:52:12.030 --> 00:52:14.400
There are incredible
resources and books,

00:52:14.400 --> 00:52:17.070
Dr. Gregor, "How Not to
Die," things like that.

00:52:17.070 --> 00:52:19.960
So we do direct people
in those ways as well.

00:52:22.680 --> 00:52:26.220
We want people on a
vegan diet to be healthy.

00:52:26.220 --> 00:52:29.760
Because you're going to be more
likely to stay with the diet.

00:52:29.760 --> 00:52:32.460
Recidivism is so
high with veganism.

00:52:32.460 --> 00:52:36.060
A lot of that is just
a social element.

00:52:36.060 --> 00:52:39.540
People don't realize the
social impact that going vegan

00:52:39.540 --> 00:52:40.270
can have.

00:52:40.270 --> 00:52:42.540
And so they want to get
back into the social graces

00:52:42.540 --> 00:52:44.020
of people.

00:52:44.020 --> 00:52:45.510
So that is part of what we do.

00:52:45.510 --> 00:52:47.010
People can go to
chooseveg.com, we

00:52:47.010 --> 00:52:49.630
have a lot of health
information there.

00:52:49.630 --> 00:52:51.770
AUDIENCE: Do you
have any pointers

00:52:51.770 --> 00:52:55.070
on how to talk to
kids, and specifically

00:52:55.070 --> 00:52:56.210
other people's children?

00:52:56.210 --> 00:52:57.710
Because kids usually
have questions,

00:52:57.710 --> 00:52:59.455
like, why don't you eat that.

00:52:59.455 --> 00:53:01.790
And the honest
answer of I don't eat

00:53:01.790 --> 00:53:04.569
cows is a very enlightening
experience for children.

00:53:04.569 --> 00:53:06.110
NATHAN RUNKLE: I
don't have any kids.

00:53:06.110 --> 00:53:12.440
I do have three nieces who are
all self-declared vegetarian

00:53:12.440 --> 00:53:16.860
or vegan, including my niece
Bella, who puts her allowance

00:53:16.860 --> 00:53:21.150
money towards a pig at Animal
Place that she's adopted.

00:53:21.150 --> 00:53:23.690
So she goes and sees this pig.

00:53:23.690 --> 00:53:27.920
Look, I think kids are much
brighter than a lot of people

00:53:27.920 --> 00:53:29.280
give them credit for.

00:53:29.280 --> 00:53:31.430
And I think that they can
understand these concepts

00:53:31.430 --> 00:53:34.620
much better than people
give them credit for.

00:53:34.620 --> 00:53:37.850
And I think that the
default for kids and humans

00:53:37.850 --> 00:53:40.820
is to be compassionate and
have empathy for animals.

00:53:40.820 --> 00:53:45.110
I don't think that I was
unique in my interest

00:53:45.110 --> 00:53:46.520
in animals growing up on a farm.

00:53:46.520 --> 00:53:50.360
In fact, I saw that with all
of my friends who were in 4H.

00:53:50.360 --> 00:53:53.540
And they would raise pigs
and cows for slaughter.

00:53:53.540 --> 00:53:55.400
And they would give
these animals names,

00:53:55.400 --> 00:53:56.840
and they would bottle
feed them, and they

00:53:56.840 --> 00:53:58.970
would stay up at night with
them if they were sick.

00:53:58.970 --> 00:54:01.940
And then they would sell them
by the pound to go to slaughter.

00:54:01.940 --> 00:54:04.100
And every single
one of those kids,

00:54:04.100 --> 00:54:06.830
essentially, was
heartbroken, and would cry,

00:54:06.830 --> 00:54:09.620
and would want to save
that animal that year.

00:54:09.620 --> 00:54:11.330
But then as the
years go on, they're

00:54:11.330 --> 00:54:13.880
just told that's the way it is.

00:54:13.880 --> 00:54:16.550
That's what these animals are
here for, we have to do this.

00:54:16.550 --> 00:54:18.800
And you could sort
of slowly see kids

00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:22.200
becoming desensitized and
changing their view on it.

00:54:22.200 --> 00:54:28.460
So I don't have, really,
specific advice on this,

00:54:28.460 --> 00:54:31.880
but I think it needs to be
appropriate given the age.

00:54:31.880 --> 00:54:35.150
I think really young
kids, we probably

00:54:35.150 --> 00:54:37.490
can talk to them in a
way that doesn't involve

00:54:37.490 --> 00:54:40.060
gory slaughterhouse footage.

00:54:40.060 --> 00:54:41.790
And that would probably
go over better.

00:54:41.790 --> 00:54:46.160
But I think that we can
talk to kids about animals

00:54:46.160 --> 00:54:47.330
having personalities.

00:54:47.330 --> 00:54:50.900
And if they have a dog or
a cat, that pigs and cows

00:54:50.900 --> 00:54:52.290
are exactly the same.

00:54:52.290 --> 00:54:54.500
I think they can
understand that concept

00:54:54.500 --> 00:54:56.690
I think it becomes challenging
when parents aren't

00:54:56.690 --> 00:54:59.870
supportive of that, because
then you have kids that get it,

00:54:59.870 --> 00:55:04.310
but they can't get food if
their parents aren't supportive.

00:55:04.310 --> 00:55:07.340
And that way, I think
it's important to have

00:55:07.340 --> 00:55:10.940
meaningful conversations
with parents as well.

00:55:10.940 --> 00:55:18.380
And encourage them to support
the children's curiosity

00:55:18.380 --> 00:55:19.520
about this.

00:55:19.520 --> 00:55:25.770
But that's easier said than
done, perhaps, sometimes.

00:55:25.770 --> 00:55:26.820
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:55:26.820 --> 00:55:28.460
This question isn't
really for me.

00:55:28.460 --> 00:55:32.349
I've been vegetarian,
or vegan, for 30 years.

00:55:32.349 --> 00:55:33.140
NATHAN RUNKLE: Wow.

00:55:33.140 --> 00:55:36.285
AUDIENCE: I think it's just,
it's been awesome for me.

00:55:36.285 --> 00:55:39.650
I have great energy.

00:55:39.650 --> 00:55:41.070
It's been amazing.

00:55:41.070 --> 00:55:43.210
Clean meat, I
would never eat it.

00:55:43.210 --> 00:55:44.210
I would never try it.

00:55:44.210 --> 00:55:45.450
I don't miss meat.

00:55:45.450 --> 00:55:47.360
I don't want to ever have meat.

00:55:47.360 --> 00:55:51.060
But what are the ethical
dimensions, maybe

00:55:51.060 --> 00:55:55.460
for some people who are
vegetarian or vegan?

00:55:55.460 --> 00:55:56.960
NATHAN RUNKLE: Yeah.

00:55:56.960 --> 00:56:00.830
Well, personally, I don't
care if vegetarians or vegans

00:56:00.830 --> 00:56:01.730
eat clean meat.

00:56:01.730 --> 00:56:04.100
It's really not for
vegetarians or vegans.

00:56:04.100 --> 00:56:08.120
So if you're a happy
vegetarian or vegan,

00:56:08.120 --> 00:56:11.480
and you want to eat beans,
nuts, legumes, awesome.

00:56:11.480 --> 00:56:13.490
Continue to do it.

00:56:13.490 --> 00:56:18.770
I think clean meat is really
about the 98% of Americans,

00:56:18.770 --> 00:56:21.110
and people around the globe,
that aren't vegetarian.

00:56:21.110 --> 00:56:22.820
That don't want to
become vegetarian.

00:56:22.820 --> 00:56:25.040
That want to
continue to eat meat.

00:56:25.040 --> 00:56:29.010
So that's kind of my take on it.

00:56:29.010 --> 00:56:33.020
I'm not here to try to
convince vegans to eat it.

00:56:33.020 --> 00:56:35.990
I want meat eaters to eat it.

00:56:35.990 --> 00:56:37.850
Yeah.

00:56:37.850 --> 00:56:39.830
Thank you everyone,
so much for spending

00:56:39.830 --> 00:56:41.030
your afternoon with me.

00:56:41.030 --> 00:56:44.380
[APPLAUSE]
