00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:02.860
As a birthday gift,
Zoey gave her niece

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:05.080
an electronic piggy
bank that displays

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:06.880
the total amount of
money in the bank

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.610
as well as the total
number of coins.

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:12.820
After depositing some number
of nickels and quarters only--

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.630
so we only have
nickels and quarters--

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.570
the display read money $2.00,
number of coins 16 How many

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.490
nickels and quarters did
Zoey put in the bank?

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:24.990
So let's define
some variables here.

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:32.570
Let's let n equal the
number of nickels.

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.120
Maybe I'll write "let" here.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:39.486
Let's let q be equal to
the number of quarters.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.359
So how many total
coins do we have?

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:46.399
We'', it's going to be
the number of nickels plus

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:47.370
the number of quarters.

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.500
So we have the nickels
plus the quarters

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.150
need to be equal to--
well, it tells us

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:53.579
we have 16 total coins.

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.370
So if we add up the
total number of nickels

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.260
plus the number of
quarters, we have 16 coins.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.180
So that's one
equation right there.

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.700
And then how much
total money do we have?

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.280
Well, however many
nickels we have,

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.690
we can multiply that
times 0.05, and that'll

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.390
tell us how much money
we have in nickels.

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.727
So 0.05 times the nickels
plus the amount of money

00:01:17.727 --> 00:01:18.560
we have in quarters.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:25.540
Well, that'll just be $0.25
per quarter, or 0.25 of $1.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.480
So let me write 0.25 times
the number of quarters.

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.140
For example, if I had 4
quarters and no nickels,

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.300
I'd have 4 times
$0.25 which is $1.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.490
And no money due to nickels.

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.000
So it's however may
nickels times $0.05

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.370
plus however many
quarters times $0.25.

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:43.540
That's the total
amount of money I have.

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.440
And her piggy bank
tells me that is $2.00.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.580
That is equal to $2.00.

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.840
So we have two equations
with two unknowns.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.280
We can solve for n and q.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.990
And let's do it by substitution.

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.240
So the easiest thing that
we could do here, let's

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.560
solve for q over here.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.920
So if n plus q is
equal to 16, we

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.250
could subtract n from both
sides of this equation.

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.940
So if n plus q is equal
to 16, if we subtract n

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.640
from both sides, we get
q is equal to 16 minus n.

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.100
So all I did is I rewrote
this first constraint

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.230
right over there.

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.400
So since this first
constraint is telling us

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.120
that q, the number
of quarters, must

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.560
be 16 minus the
number of nickels,

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.580
in the second constraint,
every place that we

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.360
see a q, every place
we see quarters,

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.770
we can replace it
with 16 minus n.

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:37.960
So let's do that.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.740
So the second constraint when
we make the substitution becomes

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:46.660
0.05n plus 0.25.

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.550
Instead of q, I'm going
to write 16 minus n.

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:57.500
That's what the first constraint
tells us. q must be 16 minus n.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.130
That is going to
be equal to $2.00.

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.070
We're solving this
system by substitution.

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:03.830
Now let's see if I
can simplify this.

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:09.090
So we have 0.05n plus-- let's
distribute the 0.25 times

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.260
the 16 and the 0.25
times the negative n.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.560
0.25 times 16, that's the
same thing as 1/4 times 16.

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.630
That's just going to be 4.

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:24.040
And then 0.25 times
negative n is minus 0.25n.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.040
And that is going to
be equal to $2.00.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.960
Let me scroll down a little bit.

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.220
I'll scroll down a little bit.

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:38.870
See we have 0.05n minus 0.25n.

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:44.850
So if I have 0.05 minus 0.25,
let me combine these terms.

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.610
So if I have 0.05 of something,
and I'm going to subtract from

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:53.080
that 0.25 of that something,
that'll give me negative 0.20

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.600
of that something.

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.000
If I combine these two terms,
I get negative 0.20 or negative

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.190
0.2n.

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.130
And then of course,
I have the plus 4.

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:08.230
Plus 4 is equal to $2.00, or we
could even just write 2 there.

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.640
Now, we can isolate the
n on the left-hand side

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.760
by subtracting 4
from both sides.

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.220
So let's subtract
4 from both sides.

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.339
And we are left with, on the
left-hand side, negative--

00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:23.140
I could just write that is
negative 0.20n is equal to 2

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:24.940
minus 4 is negative 2.

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:34.650
And then we could divide
both sides by negative 0.2.

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:40.300
Or I could write negative
0.20, the same thing.

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.140
We're not going to go too deep
into the significance in all

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.640
that.

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:45.556
We're assuming that we
have infinite precision

00:04:45.556 --> 00:04:46.420
on everything.

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:50.920
So negative 2 divided
by negative 0.2,

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:54.130
these guys cancel out,
and we are left with n

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:57.550
is equal to-- the
negatives cancel out.

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.670
2 divided by 0.2 is
just going to be 10.

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:02.230
n is equal to 10.

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:05.317
And then we know that q
is equal to 16 minus n

00:05:05.317 --> 00:05:06.400
from the first constraint.

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:12.580
q is equal to 16 minus n, which
is 10, which is going to be 6.

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:17.465
So Zoey put in 10 nickels.

00:05:17.465 --> 00:05:19.410
I want to do that in
a different color.

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:25.235
She put in 10 nickels and
6 quarters in the bank.

00:05:25.235 --> 00:05:26.110
And we can verify it.

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.090
So clearly she has 16 coins.

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:29.350
So that part makes sense.

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:32.382
10 nickels, 6 quarters,
that's 16 coins.

00:05:32.382 --> 00:05:33.090
That makes sense.

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:35.631
And we could also verify that
it's the right amount of money.

00:05:35.631 --> 00:05:41.840
10 nickels are going to be
$0.50, 10 times $0.05 each.

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.000
So it's going to be $0.50.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.510
And then 6 quarters
is going to be $1.50.

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:50.530
So it's going to be $1.50.

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:54.090
So the total amount of money she
has is $0.50 plus $1.50 which

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:55.590
is $2.00.

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:57.498
So it all works out.
