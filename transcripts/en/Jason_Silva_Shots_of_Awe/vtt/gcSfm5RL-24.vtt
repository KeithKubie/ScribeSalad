00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.490
There's a great line
by Lev Manovich that

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.048
says that cinema
essentially became

00:00:14.048 --> 00:00:19.386
a new branch of painting,
painting in time.

00:00:19.386 --> 00:00:20.010
Think about it.

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.900
No other technology
that preceded it

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.280
for capturing the numinis
for clothing the numinis,

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.500
unfolded in the dimension,
the fourth dimension of time.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.710
So photography, we were able
to take a picture of a moment.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.590
Ecstatic painting, again,
creating a portrait,

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.330
a snapshot of an
ephemeral experience.

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.980
Whereas, cinema became
this branch of painting

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.180
that unfolds in time.

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.700
And so, consider that notion.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.510
All of a sudden, we had a
technologically mediated dream

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.700
space, a way to access a
portal to the numinis that

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.250
unfolded in the
fourth dimension.

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.530
So cinema became a
kind of waking dream

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.150
where we could travel
in space and time,

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.450
where we could travel in mind.

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:02.780
This became more
than virtual reality.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.200
This became a real virtuality,
the simulated catharsis,

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.890
the symbolic, allegorical
hero's journey

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:11.960
we got to take every
time we watched a movie.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.510
It became real, right?

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:15.620
It was literalized
in our psyche.

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.820
We became literally soul
surfers when we watch movies.

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.830
And like the film,
"Inception" says,

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.300
the director is able to
architect what is essentially

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.140
a dreamspace that
the audience can then

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.790
fill with their subconscious.

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:30.110
Linkletter goes even farther.

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:35.157
He says that human beings
knew how to watch movies

00:01:35.157 --> 00:01:37.740
because we've been doing it for
hundreds of thousands of years

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:38.859
already in the dreamspace.

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:41.150
And so the reason that it
was so natural, so intuitive,

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.145
so innate for us to know
exactly how to watch movies

00:01:44.145 --> 00:01:45.950
when these came online,
was because we've

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.920
been doing it every
night forever.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.980
So what we see with cinema is
that technological advancements

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.860
met consciousness
in a new art form,

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.070
giving us access to
new numinis realms.

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.280
And I love this
notion because I love

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.490
the transformative
capacity of cinema

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.300
as a maximum,
ultimate expression

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.510
of inner, subjective
explorations,

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:09.090
transpersonal spaces, the spaces
of dreams, the spaces of mine,

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.485
the liminal zones.

00:02:10.485 --> 00:02:12.860
It's pushing the limits
of theatrical illusion

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.700
to see what we can
learn about ourselves.
