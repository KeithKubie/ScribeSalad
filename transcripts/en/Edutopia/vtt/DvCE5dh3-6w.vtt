00:00:18.346 --> 00:00:19.296
&gt;&gt;My name is Olivia.

00:00:19.296 --> 00:00:24.306
I'm seventeen and I've lived
in San Francisco my whole life.

00:00:24.756 --> 00:00:28.576
I don't have a computer.

00:00:28.576 --> 00:00:34.006
I don't always have a cell phone
but technology is like my lifeline.

00:00:34.836 --> 00:00:39.486
The places I go to get access for
computers is either at school,

00:00:40.416 --> 00:00:43.746
downstairs in my building, or
if I'm at a friend's house.

00:00:43.746 --> 00:00:49.216
&gt;&gt;Candace: How many of you guys have
access to a computer in your home?

00:00:49.386 --> 00:00:49.506
Okay.

00:00:49.936 --> 00:00:52.386
&gt;&gt;Olivia: My school is
a continuation school,

00:00:52.796 --> 00:00:54.746
or you could call it credit recovery.

00:00:54.816 --> 00:00:56.676
&gt;&gt;Candace: How many
of you guys know how

00:00:56.676 --> 00:00:58.686
to upload videos and upload pictures?

00:00:58.686 --> 00:01:02.786
Okay. So before I give you guys an
assignment, we can actually all go

00:01:02.786 --> 00:01:06.756
to the computer lab, and then whoever
knows how to do it can demonstrate.

00:01:07.106 --> 00:01:08.706
&gt;&gt;I think about one
third of the students

00:01:08.706 --> 00:01:11.106
in the classroom have access
to a computer at home.

00:01:11.156 --> 00:01:13.546
&gt;&gt;If I gave you guys an
assignment like create a video,

00:01:13.546 --> 00:01:17.156
would you do something like
that, as a final project?

00:01:17.366 --> 00:01:20.406
&gt;&gt;Kyle: Find the area of one side.

00:01:21.516 --> 00:01:23.596
&gt;&gt;The majority of them don't
have access to machines.

00:01:24.036 --> 00:01:25.826
The assumption is, "Well, they
don't know how to use them then."

00:01:26.126 --> 00:01:27.866
Well, as soon as you plop them
down in front of a computer,

00:01:27.866 --> 00:01:31.096
they're on MySpace, they're going
to Facebook, they're sending emails.

00:01:31.096 --> 00:01:33.046
I mean, so it's clear
that they've had access.

00:01:33.566 --> 00:01:40.046
&gt;&gt;I'd say Olivia, I think she's kind
of savvy and I think she's curious

00:01:40.206 --> 00:01:41.176
about learning new things.

00:01:41.986 --> 00:01:45.386
And I think soon, you're going
to have high school classes

00:01:45.386 --> 00:01:47.626
and other jobs and things
like that where a main form

00:01:47.626 --> 00:01:53.456
of communication will be through
IMing and social networking.

00:01:54.076 --> 00:01:56.016
&gt;&gt;Olivia: This is my MySpace page.

00:01:56.096 --> 00:02:00.456
I got like a picture right
here, so a little context of me.

00:02:00.856 --> 00:02:04.516
Pictures, a music video,
me and my sister.

00:02:04.826 --> 00:02:09.356
Miscellaneous comments
that people sent me.

00:02:10.526 --> 00:02:14.436
And my mom, she's a big
poker fan, so she wanted me

00:02:14.436 --> 00:02:15.826
to do her page all poker.

00:02:15.946 --> 00:02:18.666
So I got these little falling aces.

00:02:18.836 --> 00:02:21.946
This profile, like the
background, we made it ourselves

00:02:22.356 --> 00:02:23.856
and I put all the family on here.

00:02:24.086 --> 00:02:24.786
It's pretty cool.

00:02:27.026 --> 00:02:29.176
And I made a MySpace
for my mentor Dawn.

00:02:30.126 --> 00:02:30.876
&gt;&gt;Yeah, he's cute.

00:02:31.376 --> 00:02:31.536
&gt;&gt;Dawn: Yeah.

00:02:31.976 --> 00:02:32.316
&gt;&gt;Olivia: He's at the--

00:02:32.316 --> 00:02:35.396
&gt;&gt;Dawn: Olivia and I
were matched back in--

00:02:35.596 --> 00:02:38.696
oh my goodness, it'll be
eight years in November.

00:02:38.936 --> 00:02:40.396
&gt;&gt;Were we at Pier Thirty Nine?

00:02:40.916 --> 00:02:42.306
Was that where we were,
having dinner?

00:02:42.306 --> 00:02:42.836
Where were we?

00:02:43.106 --> 00:02:46.366
&gt;&gt;I'm her big sister in the Big
Sister, Big Brother program.

00:02:46.926 --> 00:02:49.636
&gt;&gt;Olivia: Dawn, she's just
a real understanding person

00:02:50.046 --> 00:02:51.776
and no matter what
I was going through,

00:02:51.776 --> 00:02:54.636
she was always there to
just like back me up.

00:02:55.096 --> 00:02:57.026
&gt;&gt;Dawn: She's amazingly creative.

00:02:57.576 --> 00:03:02.076
She's helped me with my MySpace page,
which I never would've had before.

00:03:04.076 --> 00:03:07.416
&gt;&gt;Olivia: And so one day, I was all
like, "Let's make you a MySpace,"

00:03:07.536 --> 00:03:10.336
and she was like, "I
really don't need one."

00:03:10.336 --> 00:03:12.726
And I was like, "Well,
let's just do it for fun."

00:03:12.726 --> 00:03:13.716
And so we made one.

00:03:13.716 --> 00:03:14.786
&gt;&gt;Dawn: Oh, you know what,

00:03:14.786 --> 00:03:17.366
do they have like a beach
or something like that?

00:03:17.576 --> 00:03:19.116
&gt;&gt;Travel, try travel, what's travel?

00:03:19.116 --> 00:03:22.626
&gt;&gt;Oh, that's what I'm
talking about, right there.

00:03:22.626 --> 00:03:24.516
That's where I wanna be.

00:03:24.516 --> 00:03:29.226
&gt;&gt;I consider myself relatively
savvy when it comes to computers

00:03:29.226 --> 00:03:31.426
and cell phones and things like that.

00:03:31.426 --> 00:03:34.686
But I have to say that Olivia
introduced me to a whole new world.

00:03:34.686 --> 00:03:39.246
&gt;&gt;Olivia: Oh my god, what?

00:03:39.716 --> 00:03:39.956
Oh.

00:03:40.076 --> 00:03:45.146
&gt;&gt;Dawn: See, that's
where I'd like to be.

00:03:45.146 --> 00:03:45.716
Oh my god.

00:03:46.326 --> 00:03:47.486
How do you do that?

00:03:47.486 --> 00:03:49.636
That's ridiculous that
you're so fast.

00:03:49.676 --> 00:03:50.666
I can't possibly.

00:03:50.666 --> 00:03:52.426
My thumbs don't work like that.

00:03:52.426 --> 00:03:54.436
&gt;&gt;Many other kids, they
just have that access.

00:03:54.436 --> 00:03:55.816
They have their own computer at home.

00:03:55.816 --> 00:03:56.606
They can do that.

00:03:56.606 --> 00:03:58.726
They can go to school
and use computers

00:03:58.726 --> 00:04:01.536
and have teachers that'll tell them
how to do these kinds of things.

00:04:01.606 --> 00:04:04.686
But she's really done a
lot of this on her own.

00:04:04.686 --> 00:04:06.246
&gt;&gt;All right, let's
see what you sent me.

00:04:06.246 --> 00:04:07.266
What did you say, Olivia?

00:04:08.096 --> 00:04:11.866
"When are we gonna
see an R rated movie?"

00:04:11.996 --> 00:04:15.236
&gt;&gt;She didn't have her own
computer, but what she would do is,

00:04:15.236 --> 00:04:17.706
she would go to the Apple
store and she would, you know,

00:04:17.706 --> 00:04:20.976
take her photos there that she
would post on her MySpace page,

00:04:20.976 --> 00:04:21.976
and she'd update it there.

00:04:23.026 --> 00:04:24.236
&gt;&gt;Olivia: Cheese.

00:04:30.776 --> 00:04:34.096
&gt;&gt;My cell phone, I use
it almost every second

00:04:34.096 --> 00:04:35.776
of the day when I'm not in school.

00:04:36.036 --> 00:04:37.196
&gt;&gt;Yeah, so just call me back, right?

00:04:37.376 --> 00:04:37.466
Bye.

00:04:38.576 --> 00:04:41.806
&gt;&gt;I use MySpace on my phone,
just to check if I have messages.

00:04:42.736 --> 00:04:44.236
My iPod is important to me.

00:04:44.336 --> 00:04:47.606
I thought I would never have
one, but I got it given to me

00:04:47.606 --> 00:04:49.736
from the Big Brothers,
Big Sisters event.

00:04:50.716 --> 00:04:55.676
&gt;&gt;I got about 284 songs
on here, mixed oldies,

00:04:55.706 --> 00:04:58.776
reggae tone, R and B, rap.

00:04:58.976 --> 00:05:02.376
&gt;&gt;I think it's just like my life
'cause I feel like if I don't got it,

00:05:02.436 --> 00:05:05.626
I'm like off track, or
I don't have a good day,

00:05:05.686 --> 00:05:09.246
because I need music to keep me up.

00:05:09.876 --> 00:05:13.596
My neighborhood, it's a lotta
drugs going on over there.

00:05:13.596 --> 00:05:17.736
My mom wants to get out, but
it's kinda hard in the situation.

00:05:18.446 --> 00:05:20.936
&gt;&gt;Romi: Take a picture, take it?

00:05:21.736 --> 00:05:25.536
&gt;&gt;Olivia: The people that live with
me is my mom, my older brother,

00:05:25.536 --> 00:05:28.566
my grandma, my two younger siblings.

00:05:28.746 --> 00:05:30.026
&gt;&gt;Romi: Here, hold
the dog right there.

00:05:30.576 --> 00:05:32.256
Big household, little apartment,

00:05:32.456 --> 00:05:34.536
but at least we have an
apartment to live in.

00:05:34.536 --> 00:05:36.346
&gt;&gt;And you always press this
one right here on the side.

00:05:36.576 --> 00:05:38.376
That'll take you straight
to the photo gallery.

00:05:38.376 --> 00:05:39.886
&gt;&gt;Boy: Here, give it to me.

00:05:39.886 --> 00:05:42.456
&gt;&gt;Olivia: The computer in the
basement is used for anybody

00:05:42.456 --> 00:05:43.406
that lives in the building.

00:05:43.406 --> 00:05:45.146
&gt;&gt;Girl: And let me
see your boyfriends.

00:05:45.516 --> 00:05:49.726
&gt;&gt;Olivia: They're there from
nine in the morning till six.

00:05:49.726 --> 00:05:51.256
&gt;&gt;Girl: MySpace too, okay?

00:05:51.256 --> 00:05:52.806
&gt;&gt;Olivia: Here, click on this.

00:05:53.136 --> 00:05:55.796
&gt;&gt;When I'm downstairs on the
computer at home, I'll probably spend

00:05:55.796 --> 00:06:00.016
about four, maybe five
hours, either searching

00:06:00.566 --> 00:06:05.276
up something I found
interesting on MySpace, or emails.

00:06:07.986 --> 00:06:10.676
&gt;&gt;Dawn: Olivia has, up to
this point in her life,

00:06:10.796 --> 00:06:14.196
been incredibly resourceful, not
just when it comes to learning

00:06:14.196 --> 00:06:17.816
about technology and learning
how to get to technology,

00:06:17.896 --> 00:06:19.646
but really overcoming obstacles.

00:06:19.806 --> 00:06:22.296
And I think that that's
just gonna translate,

00:06:22.506 --> 00:06:25.426
and I think she's just
gonna do great things.

00:06:25.616 --> 00:06:28.576
&gt;&gt;Woman: It's my great honor to
present Big Sister Dawn Kruger

00:06:28.576 --> 00:06:29.956
and her Little Sister Olivia.

00:06:30.606 --> 00:06:32.976
&gt;&gt;Olivia: Because of the support
I have gotten over the years,

00:06:32.976 --> 00:06:35.976
I am now in the top
three at my high school.

00:06:36.016 --> 00:06:36.083
&gt;&gt;[cheers and applause]

00:06:36.083 --> 00:06:40.546
&gt;&gt;Olivia: And just last
week, I got the great news,

00:06:40.546 --> 00:06:41.976
I passed my high school exit exam.

00:06:42.516 --> 00:06:48.046
[cheers and applause]

00:06:48.546 --> 00:06:51.276
&gt;&gt;Dawn: I have to say, after seven

00:06:51.276 --> 00:06:53.296
and a half years, I
have learned a lot.

00:06:54.186 --> 00:06:56.726
&gt;&gt;I've learned what MySpace is
and how to communicate on it.

00:06:58.336 --> 00:07:02.016
&gt;&gt;I've learned how to communicate
by text message and by doing that,

00:07:02.016 --> 00:07:06.916
I learned what acronyms like LOL
and OMG mean, and how to short just

00:07:06.916 --> 00:07:09.246
about every word in
the English language

00:07:09.316 --> 00:07:10.976
to three letters and or numbers.

00:07:11.516 --> 00:07:16.546
[laughter]

00:07:17.046 --> 00:07:18.846
