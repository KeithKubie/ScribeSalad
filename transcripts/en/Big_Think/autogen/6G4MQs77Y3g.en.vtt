the president any president would have

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:10.059
the president any president would have
 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:14.209
the president any president would have
time enough to stop and consider

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219
 
 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.550
 
sustainability beyond the talking point

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:17.560
sustainability beyond the talking point
 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.340
sustainability beyond the talking point
and beyond getting someone into the

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:20.350
and beyond getting someone into the
 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:24.120
and beyond getting someone into the
cabinet that is driven in this direction

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:24.130
cabinet that is driven in this direction
 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.640
cabinet that is driven in this direction
and frankly the current administration

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:26.650
and frankly the current administration
 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:29.040
and frankly the current administration
seems to have done that on a fairly

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:29.050
seems to have done that on a fairly
 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.570
seems to have done that on a fairly
credible scale they brought in some

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:33.580
credible scale they brought in some
 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:35.459
credible scale they brought in some
caring people on that level and I think

00:00:35.459 --> 00:00:35.469
caring people on that level and I think
 

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:38.130
caring people on that level and I think
those people have a voice certainly in

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:38.140
those people have a voice certainly in
 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.660
those people have a voice certainly in
the White House there's a lot of

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:39.670
the White House there's a lot of
 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.479
the White House there's a lot of
sustainable agricultural advocates for

sustainable agricultural advocates for
 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:44.310
sustainable agricultural advocates for

things like that they're actually
thinking through food systems when they

thinking through food systems when they
 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:48.869
thinking through food systems when they
bring them forward they're also thinking

00:00:59.220 --> 00:00:59.230
the Secretary of Agriculture I would say
 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.400
the Secretary of Agriculture I would say
that the culture of food is probably as

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:02.410
that the culture of food is probably as
 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.189

food it's something that we've ignored

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880
food it's something that we've ignored
 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.260
food it's something that we've ignored
in our country for a lot of reasons we

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270
in our country for a lot of reasons we
 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.300
in our country for a lot of reasons we
have a food science revolution that runs

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310
have a food science revolution that runs
 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.520
have a food science revolution that runs
parallel to the talking points that I'm

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530
parallel to the talking points that I'm
 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.530
parallel to the talking points that I'm
delivering right now and that food

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:16.540
delivering right now and that food
 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.749
delivering right now and that food
science revolution is based on things

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:18.759
science revolution is based on things
 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:21.060
science revolution is based on things
that we could barely recognize as food

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070
that we could barely recognize as food
 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:27.050

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060
30 years ago so I think that we have to
 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.210
30 years ago so I think that we have to
think about the culture of food the fact

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220
think about the culture of food the fact
 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.600
think about the culture of food the fact
that food actually is an important part

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.610
that food actually is an important part
 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.960
that food actually is an important part
of our culture and not just something

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970
of our culture and not just something
 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.899
of our culture and not just something

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:39.909
that fuels the culture one way shape or
 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:45.030
that fuels the culture one way shape or
