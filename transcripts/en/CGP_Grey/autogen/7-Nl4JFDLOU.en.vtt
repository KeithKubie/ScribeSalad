00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.380
 In February, there is an important holiday that should not be forgotten: 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:05.250
 Groundhog day 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.460
 If you live outside the United States and Canada, you may not know what a groundhog 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.929
 So... this is it 

00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:13.929
 They are basically squirrels with huge temper and digging holes. 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:16.929
 The holes they dug can be large, in fact, occasionally large enough to their comfortable homes 

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:18.300
 Harm to the structure of your comfortable home 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.089
 This explains the first half of their names, and the second half because they look a bit fat-- 

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:23.720
 Although not like their US and Canada companions 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.400
 They need these extra weight hibernations in winter 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.060
 This festival is because the smart groundhog will wake up from hibernation on February 2nd. 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.660
 Exploring from their caves and seeing the world 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.260
 If they see their shadow, they will retract into the hole. 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.130
 It is predicted that the winter will last for another six weeks. 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.000
 If they don’t return to the hole, it means that spring will come early. 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.020
 This festival originated from the Dutch customs weather forecast of Pennsylvania in the 19th century. 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.520
 Today, all of Canada and the 49 states in the 50 states of the United States celebrate it. 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.520
 The exception is Alaska 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.190
 In 2009, they decided to abandon the groundhog day and change it to a drought and flood day. 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.190
 Outside of Alaska, many marmots competed for the season. 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.460
 The king of weather predictions, their main weapon includes taking an attractive name like: 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.060
 Queen Charlotte and Mr. Walter Wally, from North Carolina 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:59.550
 Su Ben Nakadi Sam, from Nova Scotia, Canada 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:00.930
 Staten Island Chuck, from New York 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.690
 French Creek Freddy, from West Virginia 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:03.810
 Gus, from Athens, Georgia 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:05.910
 Although in the end this marmot was somewhat hidden under the shadow of its neighbors. 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:08.010
 Bao Ruide Li "General" 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.190
 Have fashionable facial hair 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.220
 And drank a mint Julip cocktail on the balcony of your own luxury garden. 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.159
 Looking forward to the day when the South is once again rising 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:19.460
 To the north of the general's thousand miles, Walton Willy is the king of Canadian groundhog 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.950
 It has a party every year to make it condescending and to make sure people continue to build 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.440
 Its an epic statue. 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.490
 But if there is only one king, it would be Penge Sutavini Phil. 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.390
 Not only because its name is the most fun to read 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.270
 Also because there are a good group of people wearing high hats and tuxedos taking care of it. 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.270
 And calling himself "the inner circle" 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.140
 According to them, Pengu Sutavini Phil began to predict the weather from the 1880s. 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.040
 Remind, of course not the same Penge Sutavini Phil 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.060
 But the name is functional and immortal. 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.280
 Because the "inner circle" prepares the life extension potion for it 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.130
 So it will continue to forecast the weather and attract tourism revenue until the end of the world. 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.170
 It also speaks a language called groundhog 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.530
 Only the chairman of the inner circle can understand 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.270
 If you think Groundhog Day is a stupid, meaningless activity 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:57.159
 Then you should pay attention to two things: 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:59.060
 First, you don’t have a sense of humor. 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.060
 Second, you should be careful when you are on Groundhog Day. 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.159
 Because these groundhogs have magical ability in addition to their usual weather forecasting work. 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:08.009
 Can trap you in an infinite period of time and space until you learn not to be gibberish. (Time is temporarily suspended, 1993) 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:08.710
 Happy Groundhog!
