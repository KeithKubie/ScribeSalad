00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.590
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Good
afternoon, ladies and gentlemen,

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.350
and welcome to the African
Middle East Division.

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:30.650
I'm Mary-Jane Deeb.

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.230
I'm Chief of the Division, and
I'm delighted to see you all here

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.890
for a very special program

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.520
to celebrate Jewish
American Heritage Month.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.730
Today, we're hosting Joan Nathan,
who, as our flyer points out,

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.150
is a world-famous author
of 11 cookbooks.

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.660
I have my own copy of Cooking
Provence - Four Generations

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.550
of Recipes and Traditions.

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.670
It's a fabulous book, and Joan
is well-known to all of us.

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.030
She has spoken here many times.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.640 position:56%
And today, she will be talking about
her new book, King Solomon's Table -

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.060
A Culinary Exploration of Jewish
Cooking from Around the World.

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.440
But before that, we always
do a little commercial

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.210
about our division.

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.730
And as most of you already
know, our division is made

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:23.500
up of three sections, the African,
the Near Eastern, Hebraic sections.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.510
We're responsible for materials
from 78 different countries

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:32.370
in the Near East, Central
Asia, the [inaudible],

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:37.620 position:56%
as well as from the entire continent
of Africa, North and Sub-Saharan.

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.130
And we're very active in acquiring
and developing collections,

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.790
briefing visitors coming from
all the countries of the regions,

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.880
for which we are responsible.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:55.600
We also invite scholars and experts
who have researched and done work

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.670
in our areas of responsibility,
as Joan Nathan.

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.810
And she has been a
very frequent user

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.290
of our collections,
which is wonderful.

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.850
This is why we cherish her as
one of our very special patrons.

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:17.550
And we do so, so that people get a
better insight and a better sense

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.910
of what those countries are about,
what their culture is about,

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.550
what their history is about.

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:25.850
This is why we have these experts

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:32.410
who make our collections come
alive in our reading room.

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:39.720
And we certainly collect cookbooks,
and we have here the expert.

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.360 position:56%
We have Connie Carter, who is here
with us, from the Business, Science,

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.760
and Technology, who single-handedly
has built this collection

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.000
of cookbooks from around the world
as one of the largest collection

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.400
of cookbooks in the
world on cooking.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.710
And she's made some of the
most wonderful exhibits,

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:06.060 position:56%
displays here at the Library, always
including a book of Joan Nathan.

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.690
So I mean she's -- Joan
has been everywhere,

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.460
not only in our reading
room, but in different parts

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.960
of the library and
in our collections.

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:19.340 position:56%
So we're really delighted to have
her with us, to have Connie with us,

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:26.010 position:56%
and now to introduce Joan Nathan, we
have our very own Sharon Horowitz,

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.160
the Senior Reference Librarian
in the Hebraic section,

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.080
who will be doing the introduction.

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.380
So Sharon?

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.090 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Sharon Horowitz: Yes, yes, sorry.

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.390
Thank you.

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:38.690
Thank you, Mary-Jane.

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.710
Good afternoon, and
welcome to you all.

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:45.090
The -- my name is Sharon Horowitz.

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.370
As you heard, I'm the Reference
Librarian in the Hebraic section.

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:53.530
The Hebraic section marks its
beginning in 1912, with the receipt

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.670
of 10,000 Hebrew books
and pamphlets,

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:57.980
whose purchase was
made possible by a gift

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.130
from New York philanthropist
Jacob Schiff.

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:03.880
From those humble beginnings,
our collections have grown

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:08.940
to around 250,000 items in Hebrew,
Yiddish, Ladino, Judeo-Persian,

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.910
and other Hebraic script languages.

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:14.530
The Hebraic section also includes
an important collection of Ge'ez,

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:19.760
Amharic, and Tigrinya, languages
of Ethiopia past and present.

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.730 position:56%
Two of our missions in this division
are to publicize our collections

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:25.880
and to bring people
into the library.

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.130
One way we accomplish this second
goal is by holding lectures

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:33.320
and having programs such as the
one we are hosting here today.

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.420
One item of business
before we begin,

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:39.030
this event is being videotaped
for subsequent broadcasting.

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.340
There will be a formal
question-and-answer period

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.500
after the lecture, at which
the audience is encouraged

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.410 position:56%
to ask questions and offer comments.

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:50.470
But please be advised, your
voice and image may be recorded

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:52.730
and later broadcast
as part of this event.

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:56.040
By participating in the
question-and-answer period,

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.910
you are consenting to the
Library's possible reproduction

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:00.630
and transmission of your remarks.

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.080
And also, I want to call
your attention to a display

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.810
of international Hebrew cookbooks
and some of Joan's cookbooks

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:11.170
that are in the -- toward the
front of the reading room.

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:12.820
Please look at them.

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:14.450
They were arranged
with the assistance

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:17.170
of my colleague, Dr. Anne Brener.

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:19.030
And now, a word about our speaker.

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:23.110
King Solomon's Table - A Culinary
Exploration of Jewish Cooking

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:26.950
from around the World, as you
heard, is Joan's 11th cookbook.

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:31.120
In it, she shows the global
influences on Jewish cuisine

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.930
and what makes Jewish
cooking unique.

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:39.050
As one reviewer wrote, the notes
accompanying each recipe are

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:42.280
as enriching as the
dishes themselves.

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:47.340
She is a culinary historian
and chronicler of Jewish cooks.

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:50.460
Ladies and gentlemen, please
join me in welcoming the Doyen

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:52.510
of Jewish cooking, Joan Nathan.

00:05:52.510 --> 00:06:00.050
[ Applause ]

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:01.350
&gt;&gt; Joan Nathan: Thank you, Sharon.

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:02.650
Can you all hear me?

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:04.250
Because I sometimes
have trouble hearing.

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:07.590
Is this -- can you hear now?

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:08.890
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:10.190
&gt;&gt; Joan Nathan: Good, okay.

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:14.400 position:56%
First of all, I want to apologize
that I had two books which I forgot.

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:18.010
One was for her because clearly the
publisher didn't send them to her,

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:19.340
and the other one was for me.

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:24.290
But that's okay because I can
talk without my wonderful book.

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:27.500
I love this place.

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:31.260
This is the place that I really
think of as home in Washington.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:36.000
I spent a lot of time here
with my first few books,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.070
the Jewish Holiday Kitchen.

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:43.950
I just spent -- I guess
I had more time then.

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:47.970
I don't know, or we didn't
have the Internet I guess.

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:50.930 position:56%
I spent days and days in the stacks.

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:53.670
And in fact, on my birthday
every year, I liked --

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:54.970
I would go to the stacks.

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:59.500
This year, I came to hear
Anne Brener's fabulous talk

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:03.010
on Raphael [assumed spelling]
right in this exact room.

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:05.870
And it was just a wonderful
way to spend a birthday

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:09.320
to learn more about Raphael.

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:13.860
So this is my 11th
book, and I always say

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:16.970
that I don't think I could
have written the book

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:20.660
that I wrote last without
the book for it.

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:23.700
So this book is really
looking at Jewish food

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:26.380
around the world, how
it came together.

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:31.610
And because it's so popular all
of a sudden, I kind of think

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:37.070
that in a way Jewish and Israeli
food is trumping politics,

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:38.990
that it's way up there.

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:42.840
People might not agree with the
politics, but they like the food.

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:45.540
And I think that really
all over the world,

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:48.060
people are looking for the new.

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:50.510
They're looking for
great ethnic food,

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:55.450
and that's what we
really love so much.

00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:58.540
And that's why there's so many new,

00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:04.580
exciting restaurants
from all over the world.

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:07.090
Thank you for doing this.

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:15.860
So what -- the way that this
book started was I had written --

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:20.270 position:56%
I had written a proposal for another
book, which was to be something

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:22.190
on modern Jewish cooking.

00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:25.100
And I really wasn't that
interested in doing it,

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:27.500
but I don't think I ever
admitted it to myself.

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:36.520
So I took a trip to
India, and I was in Kochi,

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:38.620
which is, you know, Cochin.

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:42.680
And I went to a synagogue
there, and on the wall it said

00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:48.030
that Jews had been there since
the time of King Solomon.

00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:53.490
And I started thinking, wow,
since the time of King Solomon?

00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:56.660
And so, I looked at
when King Solomon was.

00:08:56.660 --> 00:09:00.170
It was about 1,000 BC if
there was a King Solomon.

00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:01.700
There are two schools of thought.

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:05.090
There are some people who
think that he's really a myth,

00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:09.170
and the myth of the one -- you
know, the wise man and the king

00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:10.650
and that really there was no --

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:13.460
I mean I don't see how they can
think there was no first temple,

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:14.760
but they do.

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:17.580
Other people think that he was --

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:20.520
he did exist, and I'm
going to be with those.

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:23.610
Anyway, he's a great metaphor for
all that's wonderful and somebody

00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:26.920
who really likes good food.

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:30.040
So what I did was I looked when --

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:37.050
1,000 BC, and I went straight to
an archaeologist named Eric Klein,

00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:39.870
who many of you might know from GW.

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:43.800
And he said to me, why
don't you come with me

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:49.900
to an archaeological conference
in Baltimore, which I did.

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:53.450
And I met all the leading
archaeologists,

00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:57.710
and they told me what
they've been finding on food.

00:09:57.710 --> 00:10:01.380
And everybody told me to
read a book by Jean Bottero

00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:06.030
on the oldest cuisine in
the world, which I did read.

00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:11.860
It was from 1700 BCE,
and the book was --

00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:20.460
the book was on a cuneiform tablet
written in Acadian on four tablets

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:28.630
that are all at the Sterling
Library at Yale University.

00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:36.000
And the tablets had a -- these
44 recipes, but most of them were

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.780
for huge amounts of food.

00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:41.120
And they were for the
gods because they were --

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:43.860
everybody believed in
gods in those days.

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:47.800 position:56%
And -- but what was interesting for
me, there were -- mostly were stews.

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:49.640
There were some breads.

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:54.000
You couldn't really tell
what the recipes were.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.370
But there was one recipe
for -- thank you --

00:10:57.370 --> 00:11:00.040
for a soup, a borscht soup.

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:04.500
And then there were all
these other recipes.

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:08.800
And what I was interested,
what the ingredients were.

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:11.560
So if you look at the top of the --

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:17.040
the cover of the book right
there and you can see a bread.

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:21.280
It's an Ethiopian Sabbath bread.

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:25.950
And it's got these little
seeds on it, Nigella seeds,

00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:29.600
that we're all rediscovering now.

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:34.580
But these are some of the
oldest seeds known to man.

00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:37.180
Then there was sesame seeds.

00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:40.060
Sesame seeds, if sesame
seeds were existing then,

00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:43.350
it meant that sesame seeds
came from China already

00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:48.280
and that they're the
first ground seed oil.

00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:54.220
So they were ground into oil I'm
assuming, and if they were ground

00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:56.690
into oil, you can bet
that another ingredient

00:11:56.690 --> 00:11:58.360
that was there was chickpeas.

00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:00.820
The chickpea, the hummus was there.

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:03.340
It wasn't as a recipe in this list,

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:05.920
but this was something
that was a gruel.

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:10.160
That's what everybody ate,
but as a gruel with protein

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:15.800
so that people ate that for
morning and very often for evening,

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:20.650
poor people especially, as they
still do in the Middle East.

00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:25.540
And one thing that I've learned
since I've worked on the book was

00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:30.620
that chickpeas have been around
for about 12,000 years in the area

00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:33.670
so that everybody had hummus,

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:38.280
in case you're not aware
of the hummus wars.

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:45.410
Every single country had hummus,
and the Proverbs of Gilgamesh,

00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:48.510
which are from about the same time,
and nobody's sure exactly when,

00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:55.760
but they're certainly a lot
earlier than the 1700 BCE cookbook.

00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:58.210
They mentioned chickpea flour,

00:12:58.210 --> 00:13:01.280
and chickpea flour was what you
would have used in the winter.

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:04.740
And of course, now
everybody's so excited

00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:08.220
because everybody that's
gluten-free is suddenly eating

00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:09.670
chickpea pancakes.

00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:14.320
And they think that they're 19th
century Italian called farinata

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:20.010
or they're 19th century
French called soca.

00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:22.170
But they've been around
for thousands of years.

00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:25.220
And so, I began to
realize a few things.

00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:28.930
First of all, the timeline
of Judaism, you know, whether

00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:34.280 position:56%
or not it's exact is something else,
but also the timeline of foods.

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:36.220
There were -- I said
there were beets.

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:37.850
There were Swiss chard.

00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:41.290
There were -- well, there's dill.

00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:44.390
There were lots of
ingredients that were used then.

00:13:44.390 --> 00:13:46.960
And the sesame seeds
made me realize --

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:52.970
well, something else
that an academic at --

00:13:52.970 --> 00:14:01.350 position:56%
no, the archivist of the Sterling
Library told me was that the plates,

00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:06.010
the -- there were blue and white
plates from China, the same pattern

00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:09.600 position:56%
in China as in Cypress at that time.

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:15.640
So plates were going around, and
these blue and white also might --

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:19.950
we -- it's a surmise,
but probably is correct.

00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:22.330
At some point, they were made in --

00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:25.830
I know they were made
in Iraq or Babylonia.

00:14:25.830 --> 00:14:32.040
Then they went north and eventually
came to Scandinavia, where they --

00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:37.530
to this day, there's blue
and white Scandinavian china.

00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:40.680
But what else went from Babylonia?

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:42.300
Cardamom went with it.

00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:46.930
And so, cardamom appears in
cakes throughout Scandinavia

00:14:46.930 --> 00:14:51.760
because I always think that the
spices are a byproduct really

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:54.210
or something easily
that you can carry

00:14:54.210 --> 00:14:57.890
when you're shipping big things.

00:14:57.890 --> 00:14:59.990
Anyway, so I looked at that.

00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:03.290
Then I realized that
about 1,000 BCE,

00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:06.870
there was this man named
Abraham, who lived in Or,

00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:10.070
which isn't that far
away from Babylonia.

00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:11.370
How many miles?

00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:15.600
She knows by heart,
about 300 miles I think.

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:22.610
Anyway, and so Abraham, remember
he took the idols and broke them.

00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:24.100
He was a monotheist.

00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:29.990
And so, he went on to the land of
Canaan with his people, with his --

00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:36.880
I think he was sort of one of
the early communes with his wife,

00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:40.660
his cousins, his friends,
and they set up --

00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:43.650
they moved to the land of Canaan.

00:15:43.650 --> 00:15:47.010
And then we know from the Bible
the foods that he found there,

00:15:47.010 --> 00:15:51.650
which I'm sure he had
early on in the land of --

00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:56.910
in Babylonia because this was
the Tigris and Euphrates were

00:15:56.910 --> 00:16:03.310
in the Fertile Crescent, and
there was so much growing there.

00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:09.080
So he went and he found these seven
ingredients in the land of Canaan.

00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:17.020 position:56%
He found barley, wheat, figs, dates,
olives, grapes, and pomegranates.

00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:19.600
In addition, he found chickpeas.

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:23.240
He found lentils.

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:26.020
And he probably found fava
beans, although they --

00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:28.170
well, he would have
found them by then.

00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:36.310
So these were things that -- basic
foods that people had at that time.

00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:42.890
And I also realized that when the
Jews went, of course, to Egypt,

00:16:42.890 --> 00:16:47.160
then they came back and
built the first temple,

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:52.070
which was with King
Solomon, after King David.

00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:56.460
And the reason that I call the book
King Solomon's Table were a number

00:16:56.460 --> 00:16:57.760
of things.

00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:02.940
First of all, in the Book of
Kings, it says that the 12 tribes

00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:09.220
of Israel had to tie -- were
tithed or had to tithe the king,

00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:17.100
King Solomon, with foods and also
jewels and stones and peacocks,

00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:20.150
which they got -- I know that that
was one of the things they got.

00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:22.950
And it was written from India

00:17:22.950 --> 00:17:25.770
that they found them
as far East as India.

00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:30.790 position:56%
So each month of the year, there was
one group that was tithing the king.

00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:35.230
In addition, King Solomon,
who as we all know was wise,

00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:38.180
he also certainly had appetites.

00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:44.110 position:56%
He had 700 wives and 300 concubines.

00:17:44.110 --> 00:17:49.770
So each of these women would
have brought with her food.

00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:51.760
I mean there probably were not 700.

00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:55.290
But anyway, that's why some
people think he doesn't exist.

00:17:55.290 --> 00:17:57.130
You know, it's too many wives.

00:17:57.130 --> 00:18:03.120
Anyway, but if you go to a Buddhist
temple anywhere in the East,

00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:08.380
you see the temple or
the kingdom up top,

00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:12.640
and then in the front you'll
see places for the concubines.

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:15.330
And I realized it was a
sign of power to have lots

00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:19.830
of wives and lots of concubines.

00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:26.290
Anyway, so to me King Solomon, his
wives brought in all the spices,

00:18:26.290 --> 00:18:29.580
all the different foods, because
you would bring that from home.

00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:30.880
Wouldn't you?

00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:32.180
You would bring what
you were familiar

00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:34.190
with if you were going
someplace new.

00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:40.400
And so, there were all kinds of
flavors going on at his -- in --

00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:45.160
at his temple and also at his
palace, which was also on the --

00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:50.590
you know, it was on the
Mount, the Temple Mount.

00:18:50.590 --> 00:18:55.900 position:56%
And I also knew from the Phoenicians
that the Jews learned how

00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:58.210
to use day boats, which
were wooden boats.

00:18:58.210 --> 00:19:01.650
And they would have been
young boys probably.

00:19:01.650 --> 00:19:04.670 position:56%
I don't think anybody else would
have done this, that would have gone

00:19:04.670 --> 00:19:09.650
out and have gone as far as
India and went -- was near --

00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:14.340
were near India, and they would
see all the different foods

00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:19.740
that were growing right
on like the ginger

00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:21.930
and the cardamom and the pepper.

00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:25.860
So they'd see these spices
that were so valuable

00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:28.020
and also were transportable.

00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:29.350
And they would gather them.

00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:31.280 position:56%
Some of them would meet women there.

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:35.240
They'd marry them, or they'd at
least have children with them.

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:36.540
And they would stay.

00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:37.840
Others would leave.

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:41.220
In the 12th century, one of those
little villages that I went to,

00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:44.220
Shanondaglom [assumed
spelling] I think it's called,

00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:45.770
there was a synagogue.

00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:48.470
Well, you can bet that there
was an earlier synagogue,

00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:52.320
and I say that because when I wrote
the book of the food of the Jews

00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:59.550
of France, the one that Mary-Jane
likes so much, when I wrote that,

00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:03.880
I realized that there were
about 150 Jewish villages

00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:05.480
or villages that had Jews.

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:08.340
They weren't Jewish villages
in the South of France

00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:11.080
in the 1st and 2nd century AD.

00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:15.250
And these were all
destroyed, and the only thing

00:20:15.250 --> 00:20:17.780
that might have been
left and then some

00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:25.400
of them would be a cemetery stone
or maybe an indentation in stone

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:28.110
where a -- what do you call it?

00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:31.970
-- a mezuzah had been
so that things --

00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:38.230
and I know that one person who
has studied Indian history a lot

00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:44.190
and has used this library a lot
at first did not agree with me.

00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:45.490
And he said, you know what?

00:20:45.490 --> 00:20:48.470
You might be right, because he kept
saying unless you see an example

00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:52.010
of somebody being there, how do
you know that they were there?

00:20:52.010 --> 00:20:54.870
Well, history is a long time.

00:20:54.870 --> 00:20:58.950
And we're -- you know, a lot
of these places get floods

00:20:58.950 --> 00:21:00.850 position:56%
and all kinds of things, but anyway.

00:21:00.850 --> 00:21:04.750
And there were one -- you know,
there were hints here and there

00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:07.700
that make you realize that
of course they came there.

00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:09.980
So that was helpful to me.

00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:15.820
And then I realized that after the
destruction of the first temple,

00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:20.860
many Jews went to Babylonia.

00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:24.930
And they stayed.

00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:29.940 position:56%
And so, then they went at about that
time on the Silk Route to the right.

00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:32.190
I keep saying the right
and the left.

00:21:32.190 --> 00:21:37.000
But anyway, on the Silk Route, they
went to places like Azerbaijan,

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:47.320
to Georgia, to just all the way,
all the way around up into Russia

00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:49.860
and eventually to Poland.

00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:53.020
So there's one group
that's going around.

00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:59.530 position:56%
Then another group went later after
the destruction of the second temple

00:21:59.530 --> 00:22:09.190
through Egypt to Rome up to
France to Italy to Spain.

00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:16.000
And then from Spain, they also went
east in the 14th and 15h century

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:21.770
through Alsace-Lorraine to
Poland and Eastern Europe.

00:22:21.770 --> 00:22:26.440
So you find a conglomeration
of people all over the place,

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:28.930
and to me, that was
really interesting

00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:30.780
because it was reflected
in the food.

00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:36.370
So I felt that learning about Iraqi
food was very, very important.

00:22:36.370 --> 00:22:40.150
So I went to -- I couldn't
go to Iraq.

00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:44.010
And what I like to do is get
stories about people and food.

00:22:44.010 --> 00:22:51.970
So I went to London, where I was
told the best Iraqi cooks are.

00:22:51.970 --> 00:22:56.890
And I met with a woman named
Aileen Kolachi [assumed spelling]

00:22:56.890 --> 00:22:58.640
and who's way in her 80s.

00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:00.890
And she showed me how
to make macaroons.

00:23:00.890 --> 00:23:05.390
Macaroons started in Babylonia.

00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:07.970
Escabeche started there.

00:23:07.970 --> 00:23:12.580
You can see through people where
it wandered throughout the world.

00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:17.880
An overnight chicken
called tabit started there.

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:25.030
And people eating, you know, in the
ancient world, chicken came late

00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:32.020
as far as being not -- there
were kinds of chickens, but as --

00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:33.770
the way that we eat it is --

00:23:33.770 --> 00:23:35.430
first of all, it's really late

00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:37.150
because we had the --
remember those broilers?

00:23:37.150 --> 00:23:40.460
That's from about the
'30s, the smaller chickens.

00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:46.010
Bigger chickens were there, but
chickens -- hens were not eaten.

00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:50.360
You would take a hen
that stopped laying eggs,

00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:52.180
because that's why you had hens.

00:23:52.180 --> 00:23:54.570
Then you would slaughter
it and eat it.

00:23:54.570 --> 00:23:59.730
You would not take a young
chicken to slaughter and eat it.

00:23:59.730 --> 00:24:04.040
And the same with cocks
were used for cock fighting.

00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:06.460
And when they were too
old for cock fighting,

00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:11.020
you would make cockova
or something like that.

00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:15.310
Now -- and the rabbis would not
allow Jews, but this is much later,

00:24:15.310 --> 00:24:18.020
to use cocks for fighting.

00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:24.570
Anyway, so there -- in
the rabbinic literature,

00:24:24.570 --> 00:24:31.030 position:56%
it says that in the first century
AD the rabbis would not let Jews use

00:24:31.030 --> 00:24:35.490
chickens for cooking because they
pecked around and they were dirty.

00:24:35.490 --> 00:24:37.420
But later, of course, they did.

00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:39.830
But they let them eat
them in Babylonia.

00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:42.020
So you have this dish called tabit.

00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:45.330
If I had a copy of the book, I
would read this wonderful quote.

00:24:45.330 --> 00:24:48.580
Is there -- is the book
-- there are books, right?

00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:51.760
Just give me -- thank you.

00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:58.220
So the tabit was meant an
overnight cooked chicken,

00:24:58.220 --> 00:25:00.380
and I wanted to learn
how to make it.

00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:03.360
So there was this man named
Mayer Sofer [assumed spelling],

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:07.560
who might I'm sure came to this
library who lived in Virginia.

00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:09.180
And -- thank you so much.

00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:15.300
And he said to me, I will --
I'll show you how to make it.

00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:18.920
So I went with him to his
house, and I went with one

00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:23.190
of the Israeli ambassadors'
wives, who wanted to go shopping

00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:25.270
in Tyson's Corner,
and I said, "Look,

00:25:25.270 --> 00:25:28.890
we'll learn to make a chicken
recipe, and then we'll go

00:25:28.890 --> 00:25:31.950
to shopping, to Bloomingdale's
or wherever."

00:25:31.950 --> 00:25:34.770
So we went to -- and she
was in her finery, right?

00:25:34.770 --> 00:25:37.730
So we walk into this man's
house, and he takes --

00:25:37.730 --> 00:25:40.600
he says to her, "Do
you know how to sew?"

00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:42.180
And she said, "Yes."

00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:48.170
And so, he had skinned the chicken
already, and she took the --

00:25:48.170 --> 00:25:52.090 position:56%
he took the skin of the chicken, and
he showed her how to make pockets

00:25:52.090 --> 00:25:54.150
that she could put the rice in.

00:25:54.150 --> 00:25:57.560 position:56%
And she really gave me a dirty look.

00:25:57.560 --> 00:26:00.520
But anyway, so she was
-- needless to say,

00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:03.510
we never got on our shopping spree.

00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:07.580
[ Laughter ]

00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:11.570
But we -- I learned this
really complicated recipe

00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:14.510
that was cooked overnight,
and it was delicious.

00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:16.510
Then I realized, well, wait
a minute, people are going

00:26:16.510 --> 00:26:17.810
to want to make this recipe.

00:26:17.810 --> 00:26:19.570
There are a lot of
quick ways to do it.

00:26:19.570 --> 00:26:22.970
So then I went to visit
Aileen Kolachi,

00:26:22.970 --> 00:26:25.940
and she showed me how she makes it.

00:26:28.370 --> 00:26:32.180
And I'll just read to you
what I learned from her,

00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:35.150
which makes -- oh, my glasses.

00:26:35.150 --> 00:26:40.720
Are they right -- does anybody have
reader glasses I could just borrow?

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:43.280
Thank you so much.

00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:50.300
So -- and this is what makes doing
the kind of work I do so much fun.

00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:53.690
On a recent trip to London,

00:26:53.690 --> 00:26:57.860
I visited Aileen Dangor
Kolache [assumed spelling],

00:26:57.860 --> 00:27:00.460
one of those naturally
great cooks who lives

00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:03.260
in an apartment overlooking
Baker Street.

00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:07.960
Aileen, now in her late '80s,
may have left Baghdad in 1975,

00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:12.410 position:56%
but the family dishes decorated with
rosebuds and fragrant with cinnamon,

00:27:12.410 --> 00:27:16.110
cloves, nutmeg, cardamom,
and turmeric remain

00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:19.350
in her thoughts and
perfume her kitchen.

00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:22.760
During a delightful day, I learned
recipes and listened to stories

00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:27.250
about Aileen's early life when
some 20 people, mostly family,

00:27:27.250 --> 00:27:29.800
when family meant everything,

00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:32.610
lived in a big house
overlooking the Tigris River.

00:27:32.610 --> 00:27:36.180
"At home we used the rice
my husband's family grew,"

00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:38.070
Aileen told me in her kitchen.

00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:40.480
"The rice often had
small stones in it,

00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:42.720
so we had to clean it
before we washed it.

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:45.310
Then we washed it again, and again.

00:27:45.310 --> 00:27:50.550
The rice we get today is clean, but
we Iraqis still wash it three times

00:27:50.550 --> 00:27:52.780
and soak it for a few hours.

00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:56.480
In Baghdad, we only ate fruits
and vegetables in season,

00:27:56.480 --> 00:28:00.260
so we had to make and store what
we needed for the whole year.

00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:03.880
We even made tomato puree
for our cooking," she added.

00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:07.080
"In the summer, everybody
bought a lot of tomatoes,

00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:10.620
squeezed the juice out, sieved
them to remove the seeds

00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:14.320 position:56%
and the outer skin, and put the
juice in a big container on the roof

00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:17.060
of the house and kept
it there for a few days

00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:19.680
in the sun until it became thick.

00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:23.050
Friday was the day to start tabit.

00:28:23.050 --> 00:28:26.410
There were no home ovens
at that time in Baghdad,

00:28:26.410 --> 00:28:30.810
so the tabit was cooked on charcoal
overnight for Sabbath lunch.

00:28:30.810 --> 00:28:33.840
On top of the cover, we
put eggs in their shells,

00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:35.930
then covered it again," she said.

00:28:35.930 --> 00:28:39.730
"On top of everything was a
folded blanket to keep the heat.

00:28:39.730 --> 00:28:42.720
We ate the eggs Saturday
morning with tomatoes, onions,

00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:47.040
and lemon salad, with pickles
or spring onions and parsley."

00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:50.320
Today, most cooks have learned
speedier ways to make tabit

00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:52.500
than the one I described above.

00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:55.610
When I make it, I follow
some traditional customs

00:28:55.610 --> 00:29:00.510
like using fresh spices I grind and
cleaning the chicken with a lemon.

00:29:00.510 --> 00:29:05.650
Also, I make sure to produce
enough hakaka [assumed spelling],

00:29:05.650 --> 00:29:09.910
known in Iran as tahdig, the
prized crust of rust that forms

00:29:09.910 --> 00:29:12.100
on the bottom of the casserole.

00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:16.890
So, you know, images like that you
don't get by talking on the phone

00:29:16.890 --> 00:29:18.920
with people to get a recipe.

00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:21.990
You have to spend a
whole day at least

00:29:21.990 --> 00:29:24.060
because there's a lot
that comes out.

00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:27.220
And I did that with women in Italy.

00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:31.710
With this woman, I learned a lot of
recipes from her and other things

00:29:31.710 --> 00:29:35.090
that make what you're doing
so very, very special.

00:29:35.090 --> 00:29:40.670
And then -- and then I realized
that so much of this Iraqi food

00:29:40.670 --> 00:29:46.260
or Baghdadi food or Babylonian
food spread throughout the world,

00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:50.740
even though they had people that
came in that other conquerors,

00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:57.040
it was such a strong
commercial center that it's --

00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:59.080
when almost to the 8th century,

00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:01.720
it just was people
wanted to live there.

00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:03.200
It was a fertile region.

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:05.640
It was a crossroads.

00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:08.800
And the Jews started something
called the Radonites [assumed

00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:15.180
spelling], and the Radonites were
a group of traders that went as far

00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:21.360
as Russia, as far as China, and
they were a network of people

00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:25.400
that would -- of merchants
that would start

00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:28.300
with food, with buying spices.

00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:29.660
They'd buy gems.

00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:32.480
They'd buy -- I heard
they bought fish.

00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:38.730
I don't know how they carried live
fish, but supposedly they did,

00:30:38.730 --> 00:30:41.350 position:56%
all the way around the world with --

00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:43.960
and it was in a way
like a relay race.

00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:48.970 position:56%
And the known verbiage -- of course,
the known language was Hebrew.

00:30:48.970 --> 00:30:53.040
But there of -- they were not
the only groups, of course.

00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:54.340
I'm just talking about one group.

00:30:54.340 --> 00:30:56.440
This -- what I'm saying
could be said about a lot

00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:59.880
of different people
within that region.

00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:03.580
But there was one thing that made
them different from everybody else,

00:31:03.580 --> 00:31:08.270
and that was their food
and their laws of religion.

00:31:08.270 --> 00:31:12.580
So for me, there are three
different ways of defining --

00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:15.130
or three characteristics
of Jewish food.

00:31:15.130 --> 00:31:16.430
One of them, of course,

00:31:16.430 --> 00:31:18.750
is the dietary laws,
no question about that.

00:31:18.750 --> 00:31:22.050
Even if in the back of
your mind you don't believe

00:31:22.050 --> 00:31:24.650
in the dietary laws,
it's still there.

00:31:24.650 --> 00:31:28.440
And all the -- all the laws
of Judaism are still there.

00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:30.940
So that's number one.

00:31:30.940 --> 00:31:36.190
And also, this obsessiveness about
food, I mean believe me, it is.

00:31:36.190 --> 00:31:38.880
But I guess we're all
obsessed about food.

00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:44.860
So then the second one is this
merchant part of Judaism that just

00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:50.540
as they looked for ingredients
in India in those ancient times,

00:31:50.540 --> 00:31:53.680
Jews have always been merchants
and have always been looking

00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:57.430
for the new, maybe for the
new for themselves, the new --

00:31:57.430 --> 00:31:59.340
they've always been merchants.

00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:03.670
And that -- you can trace
that all over the world.

00:32:03.670 --> 00:32:07.540
You know, they were the first ones
to think of futures in the sense

00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:14.190
that if you buy grain when it's
first harvested and you hold it,

00:32:14.190 --> 00:32:15.860
when you buy it when
it's first harvested,

00:32:15.860 --> 00:32:17.780
there's a lot of grain, right?

00:32:17.780 --> 00:32:22.590
If you hold it to the winter,
there's not so much grain

00:32:22.590 --> 00:32:24.810
so that you can raise the prices.

00:32:24.810 --> 00:32:29.350
And that's what a lot of people
in the stock exchange learned

00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:34.660
from Jewish merchants, that this
is the way things had to go.

00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:37.910
The -- I just -- there are bakers.

00:32:37.910 --> 00:32:41.790
There's a disproportionate number
of bakers within Jewish communities

00:32:41.790 --> 00:32:44.790
because -- and just even
look in Washington today,

00:32:44.790 --> 00:32:48.100
Mark Furstenberg at Bread Furst.

00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:52.780
And cooks, there are a lot of
Jewish chefs too right now.

00:32:52.780 --> 00:32:55.970
But I have a theory about that,
which I'll tell you later.

00:32:55.970 --> 00:33:00.200
Anyway, so the second one was the
merchant and the interest in food.

00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:03.790
The third is the fact that Jews
were kicked out of so many places.

00:33:03.790 --> 00:33:08.400
So they had to adapt their cuisine
to different regions always.

00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:10.480
And I think some of you
are nodding your heads.

00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:14.200
I'm sure that Indians and Lebanese
and all kinds of -- Chinese --

00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:16.240
have also had to adapt theirs.

00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:19.820
But the point is that
you want to have the --

00:33:19.820 --> 00:33:25.000
food is comfort, and you want to
have this table-centered religion

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:28.610
as comfort with the foods
that you grew up with.

00:33:28.610 --> 00:33:30.140
And I'll give you an example.

00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:34.550 position:56%
I was -- for the book, I went to El
Salvador to interview the 100 people

00:33:34.550 --> 00:33:37.730
in the Jewish community
of El Salvador.

00:33:37.730 --> 00:33:40.810
And there was this one
woman, and they all made food

00:33:40.810 --> 00:33:42.850
for me for Friday night dinner.

00:33:42.850 --> 00:33:48.280
And a woman made yucca
latkes with cilantro cream.

00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:53.560
Well, yucca is easier to get
in El Salvador than potatoes.

00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:55.540
And so, that's what she used.

00:33:55.540 --> 00:33:57.720
And, you know, and you find
that over and over again.

00:33:57.720 --> 00:34:05.200
I found escabeche, which is a fried
and marinated fish, in Jamaica.

00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:07.100
And what do they serve it with?

00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:12.870
Scotch bonnet peppers
because -- and also allspice.

00:34:12.870 --> 00:34:20.450
Now allspice too, so what I did in
this book was I took the timeline

00:34:20.450 --> 00:34:27.410
of Jewish history, and I tried
to combine it with ingredients.

00:34:27.410 --> 00:34:31.070
So when I went to Spain
and then I went

00:34:31.070 --> 00:34:33.030
to the New World, I
realized a few things.

00:34:33.030 --> 00:34:39.500
First of all, the -- 1492 being
the time when the Jews had to get

00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:42.000
out of Spain, it was no coincidence

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:48.960
that Christopher Columbus had
his boat that started in 1492

00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:53.760
because for the eight years prior
to that, all the boats were rented

00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:55.590
for Jews that wanted to get out.

00:34:55.590 --> 00:34:59.780
They had a big -- there
were like 250,000 Jews

00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:02.140
in Spain, and they had a deadline.

00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:03.490
So they got out.

00:35:03.490 --> 00:35:10.370
When Christopher Columbus, well,
went, there were certainly Jews

00:35:10.370 --> 00:35:15.280
that were on the boats and
that stayed in the New World.

00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:22.710
And then they brought back or else
other people brought back to Jews

00:35:22.710 --> 00:35:25.540
that were called Turkish merchants.

00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:29.600
They were originally Sephardic
merchants, but they didn't want

00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:34.350
to be called Sephardic because
they knew they were being kicked

00:35:34.350 --> 00:35:35.650
out of Spain.

00:35:35.650 --> 00:35:37.760
There were also Portuguese
that were called

00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:40.330
in France Mershon [assumed
spelling] Portuguese,

00:35:40.330 --> 00:35:42.820
and they were Portuguese merchants

00:35:42.820 --> 00:35:45.660
that were also taking
these ingredients

00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:47.610
and bringing them to places.

00:35:47.610 --> 00:35:51.550
Well, first of all, they came to
Naples, which was a Spanish port.

00:35:51.550 --> 00:35:58.470
But then they went -- like,
corn, peppers, tomatoes,

00:35:58.470 --> 00:36:01.730
and I forget what other
one, potatoes --

00:36:01.730 --> 00:36:07.200
went to places like
Bulgaria and Hungary,

00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:10.120
always by the so-called
Turkish merchants.

00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:14.210
And this was a fertile
area of the Danube River.

00:36:14.210 --> 00:36:16.080
So they planted them.

00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:19.690
Most of those things were used
for fodder at the beginning,

00:36:19.690 --> 00:36:23.810 position:56%
and then eventually, like Jerusalem
artichokes, people liked using them.

00:36:23.810 --> 00:36:26.550
But the potatoes, they
were just grown

00:36:26.550 --> 00:36:28.230
for farms, that's it, not to eat.

00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:32.540
And even when my father, who
came from Germany in 1929,

00:36:32.540 --> 00:36:33.890
when he came to the United States

00:36:33.890 --> 00:36:36.590
and there was all this good
corn, he wouldn't eat it.

00:36:36.590 --> 00:36:39.240
He said that's just for animals.

00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:45.280 position:56%
So I guess in Southern Germany, they
didn't have really good corn then.

00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:49.040
So I realized that -- and the
other thing that I realized

00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:54.020
in the centuries before
where foods went.

00:36:54.020 --> 00:36:59.420
Where foods went were very easy
for me to figure out their roots

00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:04.020
because you can see
there's a lot written on it.

00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:08.200
And -- but it's really
interesting to trace it,

00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:10.150
and you'll see it in my book.

00:37:10.150 --> 00:37:13.690
But the other thing that
was a big, big help to me,

00:37:13.690 --> 00:37:16.770
and I'm doing all this academic
stuff because this is the Library

00:37:16.770 --> 00:37:21.600
of Congress, is -- was
the Genizah in Cambridge.

00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:24.950
So I went there, and
I was really lucky

00:37:24.950 --> 00:37:30.300
because then Woodwright [assumed
spelling], who was the archivist,

00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:34.710
spent a lot of time with me
telling me about the ephemera.

00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:37.410
Do you know -- does everybody
here know what the Genizah is?

00:37:37.410 --> 00:37:40.690
It's this -- you do, or you don't?

00:37:40.690 --> 00:37:49.980
Okay. So a genizah were like
a treasure chest of documents.

00:37:49.980 --> 00:37:52.360
They say they were
in Christian churches

00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:56.500
and mosques and in synagogues.

00:37:56.500 --> 00:38:00.830
And they -- they're lost
documents of ephemera mostly.

00:38:00.830 --> 00:38:04.120
But they're supposed to keep
everything that was written

00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:08.040
on sheepskin or paper with
the name of God in it.

00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:15.770 position:56%
And they found one of these treasure
chests in the Cairo synagogue

00:38:15.770 --> 00:38:18.890
in about the end of
the 19th century.

00:38:18.890 --> 00:38:22.750
And I mean it's -- there's a
wonderful book called Sacred Trash

00:38:22.750 --> 00:38:26.550
that if any of you want to
read, you'll read about the --

00:38:26.550 --> 00:38:31.910
it's a wonderful detective story
about how all this stuff was found

00:38:31.910 --> 00:38:34.690
and then how you read
about different people.

00:38:34.690 --> 00:38:38.390
And there were letters so
that I learned, for example,

00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:42.640
that there was a -- remember I
said that there's like a relay race

00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:48.350
from Aden to Cairo, or
it was called Fustat,

00:38:48.350 --> 00:38:52.310
which is part of Cairo today.

00:38:52.310 --> 00:38:56.890
And then some went to
Ceylon, these boats.

00:38:56.890 --> 00:39:01.740
And then a lot of the heads of the
boats would write these letters,

00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:06.090
and they would say -- write one
letter to another merchant saying,

00:39:06.090 --> 00:39:11.470
"I slipped in some turmeric
and other spices so that the --

00:39:11.470 --> 00:39:16.200
so you wouldn't have
to pay tariff on them."

00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:19.700
And you knew that these
were from men for,

00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:22.550
you know, the -- for virility.

00:39:22.550 --> 00:39:26.800
And it's really interesting
to see what went

00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:28.760
on just in what they wrote.

00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:33.400
And this was a way of endearing
one merchant to another merchant,

00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:37.180
or there was wheat sent
to a community in Aden

00:39:37.180 --> 00:39:39.540
because they didn't
have wheat at the time.

00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:40.840
And, you know, you're supposed

00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:44.020
to make a wheat challah
on Friday night.

00:39:44.020 --> 00:39:47.360
So you got senses, or
one I have in my book,

00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:51.710
a woman who was a lousy cook,
and her husband went out,

00:39:51.710 --> 00:39:57.930
and this was what you
learned what people did.

00:39:57.930 --> 00:40:03.740
He had the shopping list because
a lot of the women were kept in --

00:40:03.740 --> 00:40:06.350
they were in their
courtyards or at home.

00:40:06.350 --> 00:40:07.650
They didn't go out.

00:40:07.650 --> 00:40:10.630
And it was a way of a man
saying, look, I made the money.

00:40:10.630 --> 00:40:13.580
So he would go out like on a
Wednesday because it was --

00:40:13.580 --> 00:40:15.480 position:56%
you wanted to have food for Shabbat.

00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:18.380
He would go -- when he got his
paycheck, if it was Wednesday

00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:24.070 position:56%
or Thursday, he'd come after work,
go to the market, and you can see it

00:40:24.070 --> 00:40:26.940
like in Machneyuda
in Jerusalem today.

00:40:26.940 --> 00:40:30.650
Go there, he'd buy the
ingredients that she said,

00:40:30.650 --> 00:40:32.170
and he'd bring them home.

00:40:32.170 --> 00:40:36.320
So he had this one recipe,
this man who wrote a lot

00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:39.240
about his wife being
a terrible wife.

00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:41.010
But my editor made me take it out.

00:40:41.010 --> 00:40:42.310
I don't know why.

00:40:42.310 --> 00:40:45.410
Anyway, so -- but she could cook.

00:40:45.410 --> 00:40:53.140
So he had this one recipe for
Shavuot, one hen for the Sabbath,

00:40:53.140 --> 00:40:55.790
eggplant, and some other things.

00:40:55.790 --> 00:40:59.280
So I looked in old books because
I realized that most things --

00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:04.070
you know, that people didn't
have different like a vegetable

00:41:04.070 --> 00:41:07.030
on one side, and that came later.

00:41:07.030 --> 00:41:10.040
They would have a stew pretty much.

00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:13.210
That's what you would have
for your dishes, or, you know,

00:41:13.210 --> 00:41:17.820
a stew like a couscous, where
you'd have rice and you'd have --

00:41:17.820 --> 00:41:23.050 position:56%
anyway, so I looked in old, old
cookbooks for chicken with eggplant,

00:41:23.050 --> 00:41:25.360
and I had never known
that as a Sabbath dish.

00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:31.400
And there it was in all
of these Iraqi cookbooks

00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:33.300
and also different
Sephardic cookbooks.

00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:39.650 position:56%
And you realize a lot of the people
that came to Spain came through Iraq

00:41:39.650 --> 00:41:45.200
so that -- and I'm convinced
that they went back to Iraq maybe

00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:48.300
after 400 years because
they still --

00:41:48.300 --> 00:41:52.690 position:56%
when they were kicked out of Spain,
when they still had relatives there.

00:41:52.690 --> 00:41:54.620 position:56%
And then they went around the world.

00:41:54.620 --> 00:41:58.720
So, you know, and then
they went to India,

00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:02.730
because I met this woman named
Queenie Halegwa [assumed spelling]

00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:09.860
in Kochi, and she invited
me for dinner.

00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:11.490
And she kept talking about pastel.

00:42:11.490 --> 00:42:15.510 position:56%
And her -- and I thought, wait a
minute, this woman is not Sephardic.

00:42:15.510 --> 00:42:17.250
She's really Iraqi.

00:42:17.250 --> 00:42:19.110
And her son said the same thing.

00:42:19.110 --> 00:42:21.760
He said, "I think that
our family was in Spain.

00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:23.930
They came back, but
she liked that pastel,

00:42:23.930 --> 00:42:28.960
which is like a pastry
filled with things."

00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:31.600
Oh, there are many
different kinds of pastels.

00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:35.870
And then brought it back to --
hit comes in families, right,

00:42:35.870 --> 00:42:37.990
these words and these recipes.

00:42:37.990 --> 00:42:42.030
The other thing is there's no -- in
the Genizah, there are no recipes.

00:42:42.030 --> 00:42:45.120
There are shopping lists, and
then there are prescriptions

00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:47.880
from doctors, like Mimodenes
[assumed spelling] would have

00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:51.660
written you need this -- you
need chicken and chicken soup.

00:42:51.660 --> 00:42:52.960
And so they would talk

00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:56.240
about different ingredients
that you would need.

00:42:56.240 --> 00:42:59.570 position:56%
So the Genizah's really interesting.

00:42:59.570 --> 00:43:01.620
So please read that.

00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:07.330
So -- and then of course, food
has changed tremendously today,

00:43:07.330 --> 00:43:14.830
and that's because
of the world of 1850s

00:43:14.830 --> 00:43:20.620
on where we have all this rich
food and the processed food.

00:43:20.620 --> 00:43:23.460
The Age of Industrialization
changed everything

00:43:23.460 --> 00:43:24.870
and changed it very quickly.

00:43:24.870 --> 00:43:29.260
I'm convinced that in the ancient
world, it took a lot longer time

00:43:29.260 --> 00:43:31.340
to -- for food to change.

00:43:31.340 --> 00:43:32.930
For us, it's within weeks.

00:43:32.930 --> 00:43:34.820
We've got email.

00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:41.700
We have radio, TV, cook --
how many cookbooks do we have?

00:43:41.700 --> 00:43:43.400
But it used to be that
you would learn it

00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:45.530
from your mother, from your family.

00:43:45.530 --> 00:43:47.730
In a way, it was like
the closed communities

00:43:47.730 --> 00:43:51.980
of today, but just family units.

00:43:51.980 --> 00:43:54.430
And that's -- and people would

00:43:54.430 --> 00:43:58.930
in different countries
guard their foods

00:43:58.930 --> 00:44:02.800
so preciously within the community.

00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:05.990
And I've gone way beyond
my speaking.

00:44:05.990 --> 00:44:08.890
Okay. So you can look at my book.

00:44:08.890 --> 00:44:10.190
I hope you will like it.

00:44:10.190 --> 00:44:13.430
It's got recipes from
all over the world.

00:44:13.430 --> 00:44:18.200
And I've gone to a lot of
places to get these recipes.

00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:22.010
I've got -- and I'd love to see
if any of you have any questions

00:44:22.010 --> 00:44:26.920
because we can -- then I can answer
talking about some of my recipes.

00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:28.220
Tamara [assumed spelling],
you'd better ask

00:44:28.220 --> 00:44:29.880
about your mom, your father.

00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:31.430
&gt;&gt; Tamara: My father?

00:44:31.430 --> 00:44:33.730
&gt;&gt; Joan Nathan: Yeah.

00:44:34.790 --> 00:44:37.090
&gt;&gt; Tamara: My mother?

00:44:37.090 --> 00:44:41.040
My mother's from Rome.

00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:53.780
My father's from Bulgaria, and they
did have pastel [inaudible] pastel.

00:44:53.780 --> 00:44:57.360 position:56%
So I noticed when we spoke about it,

00:44:57.360 --> 00:44:59.620
you talked about it
almost as a dessert.

00:44:59.620 --> 00:45:02.720
They -- the way they would
cook pastel using eggplant

00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:05.550
and ground beef, so I
wonder if you can --

00:45:05.550 --> 00:45:07.310
&gt;&gt; Joan Nathan: Okay, so that --
yeah, well, that's in my book,

00:45:07.310 --> 00:45:10.390
that recipe from your -- okay,
so what she asked the pastel

00:45:10.390 --> 00:45:14.730
that her father talked about was
different from what I'm saying.

00:45:14.730 --> 00:45:16.850
A pastel can be a pie, a meat pie.

00:45:16.850 --> 00:45:20.430
And Tamara's sister, she's
related to my husband,

00:45:20.430 --> 00:45:23.580
but her sister gave me two
amazing recipes from the family.

00:45:23.580 --> 00:45:27.070
And one of them -- I mean
her father's family thinks

00:45:27.070 --> 00:45:28.660
that they came -- they're
direct descendants --

00:45:28.660 --> 00:45:33.490
I hate to tell you a lot of people
think that -- of King David.

00:45:33.490 --> 00:45:39.190
So she had a challah recipe that
is so good, that is so wonderful

00:45:39.190 --> 00:45:42.000
that you can see that
it went to the Balkans.

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.930
It came from Spain up to
the Balkans to New York,

00:45:44.930 --> 00:45:46.230
and now her sister's
living in Israel.

00:45:46.230 --> 00:45:47.530
So -- oh, and Italy,
she lived in Italy.

00:45:47.530 --> 00:45:49.950
So it picks up things, like
her kids like hot dogs.

00:45:49.950 --> 00:45:51.250
Hot dogs are in it.

00:45:51.250 --> 00:45:53.230
She's got eggplant because
they lived in Bulgaria.

00:45:53.230 --> 00:45:55.140
Eggplant is in it.

00:45:55.140 --> 00:45:58.470
And these -- that's what's
wonderful about recipes.

00:45:58.470 --> 00:46:02.120
The pastel that she has,
which is really delicious.

00:46:02.120 --> 00:46:03.550
I'm telling you.

00:46:03.550 --> 00:46:08.580
It's got eggplant and meat and
ground beef and I think tomato.

00:46:08.580 --> 00:46:10.750
And you make it -- I
make it with puff pastry.

00:46:10.750 --> 00:46:13.450
I think that's what she
said to do, or no, no, no.

00:46:13.450 --> 00:46:14.900
I do not make it with puff pastry.

00:46:14.900 --> 00:46:16.200
I tell you, you can.

00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:20.140
It's a really easy pastry, and
then you put it on the bottom,

00:46:20.140 --> 00:46:22.380 position:56%
put this in, you know, and cover it.

00:46:22.380 --> 00:46:24.170
Delicious.

00:46:24.170 --> 00:46:26.260
Everybody loved it when I made it.

00:46:26.260 --> 00:46:29.710
So it's one of the great
recipes of the book.

00:46:29.710 --> 00:46:31.010
Any other -- hi.

00:46:31.010 --> 00:46:32.310
&gt;&gt; Audience Member: Thank you.

00:46:32.310 --> 00:46:33.610
Thank you very much.

00:46:33.610 --> 00:46:34.910
It was very exciting.

00:46:34.910 --> 00:46:36.210
I'm looking forward
to reading your book.

00:46:36.210 --> 00:46:37.510
I wanted to ask you.

00:46:37.510 --> 00:46:44.010
Since you were traveling with
the food, what was being used

00:46:44.010 --> 00:46:46.350
to preserve the food,
for example, the fish

00:46:46.350 --> 00:46:50.410
or the vegetables or whatever?

00:46:50.410 --> 00:46:52.710
What are their spices
that are useful

00:46:52.710 --> 00:46:55.510
for preserving or for
cooking things?

00:46:55.510 --> 00:46:56.810
&gt;&gt; Joan Nathan: Okay.

00:46:56.810 --> 00:46:58.110 position:56%
Well this is a really good question.

00:46:58.110 --> 00:47:01.530
What spices or what ways
of preserving things?

00:47:01.530 --> 00:47:05.950
Well, the ways were, you
know, very, very old.

00:47:05.950 --> 00:47:09.250
Salting was the primary
one, and that's why salt

00:47:09.250 --> 00:47:13.120
in a way was so precious.

00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:14.420
You could salt fish.

00:47:14.420 --> 00:47:15.720
You could salt vegetables.

00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:19.770 position:56%
You could -- vegetables, though, the
best way to preserve was in the sun.

00:47:19.770 --> 00:47:22.870
And just the way they took these
tomatoes and put them on the roof,

00:47:22.870 --> 00:47:24.820
and they do that to this day.

00:47:24.820 --> 00:47:29.070 position:56%
I was in a little village in
Galilee, an Arab village in Galilee,

00:47:29.070 --> 00:47:33.520
and they were drying their
wheat on the top of the --

00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:36.660
for Balger [assumed
spelling] on the top of roofs.

00:47:36.660 --> 00:47:42.320
So that -- you know, that's --
and of course, salting fish,

00:47:42.320 --> 00:47:46.730
salting fish, but also
putting it in vinegar.

00:47:46.730 --> 00:47:51.020
A lot of vegetables were either
dried, or the Italian Jews,

00:47:51.020 --> 00:47:56.030
for example, they would
pickle their zucchini.

00:47:56.030 --> 00:48:00.190
But Turkish Jews would salt
it -- I mean, excuse me,

00:48:00.190 --> 00:48:02.820
dry it and then I'm sure
you've seen eggplant

00:48:02.820 --> 00:48:06.290
and zucchini put on long strings.

00:48:06.290 --> 00:48:10.140
So there were different ways,
and this was so important.

00:48:10.140 --> 00:48:20.200
The Bedouins to this day still salt
their yogurt to make it into fish.

00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:23.110
I mean excuse me, to
make it into cheese.

00:48:23.110 --> 00:48:26.250
So it's very dry, and
it's very salty.

00:48:26.250 --> 00:48:29.310
So you dehydrate it, and
it won't be as salty.

00:48:29.310 --> 00:48:33.690
And you can use it in
the winter as cheese.

00:48:33.690 --> 00:48:38.970
Yeah, so -- and then as far
as spices, I'll tell you this.

00:48:38.970 --> 00:48:41.310
I think it's an interesting story.

00:48:41.310 --> 00:48:46.810
The spice allspice was
from -- is from Jamaica.

00:48:46.810 --> 00:48:53.390
So I think that allspice came to
England, was called English pepper,

00:48:53.390 --> 00:48:58.910 position:56%
and there was another ingredient
called cubeb, which was a little bit

00:48:58.910 --> 00:49:04.300
like allspice, a little bit like
pepper, a little bit grainier.

00:49:04.300 --> 00:49:09.220
And that was used until
allspice, which is very much used

00:49:09.220 --> 00:49:13.010
in the Middle East, came
down to Babylonia from --

00:49:13.010 --> 00:49:18.010
or to Baghdad from England,
and it just wiped it out.

00:49:18.010 --> 00:49:20.170
No one uses cubeb anymore.

00:49:20.170 --> 00:49:25.090
But I have a feeling cubeb
might -- it's like a berry.

00:49:25.090 --> 00:49:30.070
It might be Sancho
pepper, and I'm not sure.

00:49:30.070 --> 00:49:33.160
Anyway, but -- so that
things change.

00:49:33.160 --> 00:49:34.540
Yeah. Yes?

00:49:34.540 --> 00:49:36.840
&gt;&gt; Audience Member: You mentioned

00:49:42.270 --> 00:49:50.420
that the early dishes
were largely stews.

00:49:50.420 --> 00:50:03.010
This would sort of fit in with
ceramic like pottery-type stuff

00:50:03.010 --> 00:50:05.780
that would only take indirect heat.

00:50:05.780 --> 00:50:15.110
But in all of your many, many,
many studies, what is something

00:50:15.110 --> 00:50:17.460
about the history of
where it was used?

00:50:17.460 --> 00:50:21.380
When did metal come in for
the Jewish communities?

00:50:21.380 --> 00:50:22.680
&gt;&gt; Joan Nathan: When did what?

00:50:22.680 --> 00:50:24.150
&gt;&gt; Audience Member:
When did metal cookware?

00:50:24.150 --> 00:50:25.530
&gt;&gt; Joan Nathan: Oh, well --

00:50:25.530 --> 00:50:26.830
&gt;&gt; Audience Member: Ceramic
crockery type things.

00:50:26.830 --> 00:50:28.530
&gt;&gt; Joan Nathan: I mean
it came in late.

00:50:28.530 --> 00:50:31.230
You know, it was used
like iron was used first.

00:50:31.230 --> 00:50:37.830
That was used very early,
probably, I don't know,

00:50:37.830 --> 00:50:41.620
12th century, maybe earlier.

00:50:41.620 --> 00:50:46.790
But a lot of metal came at
the Age of Industrialization.

00:50:46.790 --> 00:50:48.350
You know, we were this --

00:50:48.350 --> 00:50:51.040
last summer, my husband and
I went to -- where was it?

00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:52.340
Marquette, Michigan.

00:50:52.340 --> 00:50:54.450
Have any of you ever been there?

00:50:54.450 --> 00:51:00.260
And there's this huge iron ore --
it's like an elevated iron ore --

00:51:00.260 --> 00:51:04.610
I don't know what it is,
to load the iron ore.

00:51:04.610 --> 00:51:08.950
It's maybe 30 -- it's as high
as this -- as this ceiling.

00:51:08.950 --> 00:51:12.890
And you load -- they would come,
and trains would go up to the top,

00:51:12.890 --> 00:51:18.190
and they'd load the iron ore,
little pellets that they made.

00:51:18.190 --> 00:51:22.030
And I realized that
this makes the --

00:51:22.030 --> 00:51:24.590
and they would go down
to Benton Harbor

00:51:24.590 --> 00:51:26.250
to make all the steel that we use.

00:51:26.250 --> 00:51:29.510
And I realize how really late
processed all this stuff was.

00:51:29.510 --> 00:51:33.900
It was just people
making it till then.

00:51:33.900 --> 00:51:40.740
But it was, you know, I
mean individuals making it.

00:51:40.740 --> 00:51:44.640
And the Age of Industrialization
just changed everything.

00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:45.940
Yeah?

00:51:45.940 --> 00:51:47.240
&gt;&gt; Audience Member: How many
countries are represented

00:51:47.240 --> 00:51:49.600
in the book, as far as
[inaudible] countries?

00:51:49.600 --> 00:51:52.620
&gt;&gt; Joan Nathan: How many
recipe -- how many countries?

00:51:52.620 --> 00:51:55.070
Well, there are I think about 30

00:51:55.070 --> 00:51:57.580
to 40 different countries
represented in the book.

00:51:57.580 --> 00:52:01.330
And I could have -- now that
I'm speaking around the country,

00:52:01.330 --> 00:52:04.910
I've learned that Azerbaijani, all
these people, I mean Azerbaijan is

00:52:04.910 --> 00:52:10.350 position:56%
in the book, but people are coming
to me with lots and lots of recipes.

00:52:10.350 --> 00:52:12.210
They're coming to me
-- oh, they say Haiti.

00:52:12.210 --> 00:52:14.530
There's a group of Jews
that lives in Haiti.

00:52:14.530 --> 00:52:17.790
So I'm going to ask Jose
Andreas if I can go with him

00:52:17.790 --> 00:52:20.870
to find these Jew -- I mean you
know, I'm -- it's so interesting.

00:52:20.870 --> 00:52:24.320
I mean I always thought
that writing these books,

00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:25.840
I would be bored after a while.

00:52:25.840 --> 00:52:27.310
I'm never bored.

00:52:27.310 --> 00:52:30.560
It's just -- you know, I get
all these letters about --

00:52:30.560 --> 00:52:34.690
I drive Sharon crazy because I want
to find out if a Yiddish recipe,

00:52:34.690 --> 00:52:40.880
we can find it here that I
can't find in any of my books.

00:52:40.880 --> 00:52:43.980 position:56%
But, you know, and at the Library of
Congress, I learned so many things.

00:52:43.980 --> 00:52:45.280
For example, I forget.

00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:47.050
Who was the man that knew
so much about the collection

00:52:47.050 --> 00:52:49.160
who passed away of the --

00:52:49.160 --> 00:52:51.310
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:52:51.310 --> 00:52:52.610
What?

00:52:52.610 --> 00:52:53.910
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:52:53.910 --> 00:52:55.210
Myron Meinstein [assumed
spelling] was one,

00:52:55.210 --> 00:52:56.510
but there was this other person.

00:52:56.510 --> 00:52:57.810
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:52:57.810 --> 00:53:00.610
No. Anyway, but Myron would know.

00:53:00.610 --> 00:53:08.010
For example, sauce Portuguese,
whenever you use a Portuguese sauce

00:53:08.010 --> 00:53:12.110
in the early cookbooks, it
meant that it was a tomato sauce

00:53:12.110 --> 00:53:14.920
and that it was a Jewish
tomato sauce because, again,

00:53:14.920 --> 00:53:17.170
these Portuguese merchants.

00:53:17.170 --> 00:53:23.920
And I'll tell you one quick story
about the Portuguese merchants.

00:53:23.920 --> 00:53:27.180
They were very -- there was
always somebody who was a doctor

00:53:27.180 --> 00:53:29.860
in the family -- in these
Portuguese families.

00:53:29.860 --> 00:53:32.990
And there was one doctor named
John du Sucara [assumed spelling],

00:53:32.990 --> 00:53:34.450
who I spent a lot of
time in the Library

00:53:34.450 --> 00:53:37.560
of Congress before everything
was digitalized looking him

00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:39.210
up and learning about him.

00:53:39.210 --> 00:53:42.830
And he was the earliest
-- the only Jew living

00:53:42.830 --> 00:53:45.740
in -- what do you call it?

00:53:45.740 --> 00:53:50.010
Williamsburg, Virginia,
at the time Jefferson.

00:53:50.010 --> 00:53:53.280
And you can see at Winter
Tour [assumed spelling] some

00:53:53.280 --> 00:53:57.040
of his painting of him, and
somebody wrote on the back,

00:53:57.040 --> 00:53:59.970
he introduced tomatoes to Virginia.

00:53:59.970 --> 00:54:03.670
And there was this I think
apocryphal story that he was

00:54:03.670 --> 00:54:10.130
with Thomas Jefferson, and they
were in Petersburg, Virginia,

00:54:10.130 --> 00:54:14.900
and Thomas Jefferson started eating
a tomato because it was a member

00:54:14.900 --> 00:54:16.590
of the nightshade family, right?

00:54:16.590 --> 00:54:21.270
And so, everyone thought that
they were just to look pretty.

00:54:21.270 --> 00:54:24.230
And he bit into it, and
everyone went [gasp].

00:54:24.230 --> 00:54:25.920
And of course, he didn't die.

00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:27.540
So people started eating tomatoes.

00:54:27.540 --> 00:54:31.190 position:56%
I don't -- I mean I've heard that
story from a lot of different towns.

00:54:31.190 --> 00:54:34.300
So I'm not sure if it's true
or not, but I like the story.

00:54:34.300 --> 00:54:38.050
Anyway, but he really introduced
them because he knew a --

00:54:38.050 --> 00:54:43.730
because he was a scientist and
because he had the experience

00:54:43.730 --> 00:54:47.070
of being a Jew and eating
these things, again,

00:54:47.070 --> 00:54:51.600 position:56%
within his insular family in London,
and it was a well-known family.

00:54:51.600 --> 00:54:53.560
But he never married.

00:54:53.560 --> 00:54:57.410
He started the Wine
Society in Williamsburg.

00:54:57.410 --> 00:55:00.960
His house, you can still
see it, where he lived.

00:55:00.960 --> 00:55:03.930
You know, it sounds
like he was a quiet man.

00:55:03.930 --> 00:55:06.480
I'd love to learn more about it.

00:55:06.480 --> 00:55:08.530
If any of you -- you
know more about him?

00:55:08.530 --> 00:55:10.060
No? Okay. Another question?

00:55:10.060 --> 00:55:12.360
&gt;&gt; Audience Member:
What's your theory

00:55:14.210 --> 00:55:15.660
about why there are
so many Jewish chefs?

00:55:15.660 --> 00:55:16.960
&gt;&gt; Joan Nathan: Ah,
oh, good question.

00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:18.260
What's my theory about why
there's so many Jewish chefs?

00:55:18.260 --> 00:55:26.380
Okay, in 1968, there was -- a
chef was a blue collar worker.

00:55:26.380 --> 00:55:28.530
So remember Paul Prudone
[assumed spelling]

00:55:28.530 --> 00:55:30.300
and this guy Louie
Sotmarie [assumed spelling]

00:55:30.300 --> 00:55:32.860
from the bakery in Chicago?

00:55:32.860 --> 00:55:39.560
They lobbied to change
the assignation of chef

00:55:39.560 --> 00:55:43.020
from blue collar worker
to white collar worker,

00:55:43.020 --> 00:55:45.350
which they did in 1968.

00:55:45.350 --> 00:55:47.610
And it took a while, you know?

00:55:47.610 --> 00:55:50.990
And all I could think of when
that happened, especially now

00:55:50.990 --> 00:55:54.280
when there's so many Jewish
chefs, is that Jewish mothers

00:55:54.280 --> 00:55:59.860
at that time wanted their sons
to go to be a doctor or a lawyer,

00:55:59.860 --> 00:56:03.120
but now being a chef
has a lot of prestige.

00:56:03.120 --> 00:56:08.120
So they were -- I mean I'm sort
of being ludicrous about this.

00:56:08.120 --> 00:56:14.000
But I think in a way
it's a respected career,

00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:16.790
and there are more
and more and more.

00:56:16.790 --> 00:56:19.000
And I'm just amazed at it actually.

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:23.020
And also, the reception
of Jewish food, you know,

00:56:23.020 --> 00:56:27.300
when I was very young,
it wasn't so popular.

00:56:27.300 --> 00:56:29.930
Anyway, is there one more
question, or -- okay?

00:56:29.930 --> 00:56:33.110
&gt;&gt; Audience Member: Did you
notice a major difference

00:56:33.110 --> 00:56:35.690
between Ashkenazi Sephardic
and Mizrachi foods?

00:56:35.690 --> 00:56:36.990
&gt;&gt; Joan Nathan: Oh, okay.

00:56:36.990 --> 00:56:38.290 position:56%
It was did I notice a big difference

00:56:38.290 --> 00:56:41.970
between Ashkenazi Sephardic
and Mizrachi?

00:56:41.970 --> 00:56:44.680
Mizrachi means in a
way everything else.

00:56:44.680 --> 00:56:48.460
So Sephardic would mean
if a Jew went to Spain,

00:56:48.460 --> 00:56:51.330
but if a Jew is --
still can be Iraqi.

00:56:51.330 --> 00:56:55.690
In my book, I try not to use
the word Sephardic and Ashkenazi

00:56:55.690 --> 00:56:57.700
because I think in a
way it's irrelevant.

00:56:57.700 --> 00:57:00.750
It's sort of where
each family journeyed.

00:57:00.750 --> 00:57:02.080
So I did find lots.

00:57:02.080 --> 00:57:06.410
I mean I for sure more than any
other book because I went to --

00:57:06.410 --> 00:57:09.860
I didn't -- I didn't
always have to go to places.

00:57:09.860 --> 00:57:14.170
For example, there are a lot of
Azerbaijani Jews now in Brooklyn.

00:57:14.170 --> 00:57:17.790
And there are Uzbeki Jews in
Brooklyn with really good food,

00:57:17.790 --> 00:57:24.060
if you go to the families and
other places around the country.

00:57:24.060 --> 00:57:27.550
So all I had to -- or
Iranian food in LA.

00:57:27.550 --> 00:57:31.960
So I went there rather than
traveling around the world.

00:57:31.960 --> 00:57:35.900
But I got some great int in
by the way, and in Israel,

00:57:35.900 --> 00:57:38.940
I got a lot of great
recipes, Bulgaria.

00:57:38.940 --> 00:57:42.730
Or you can get in Libyan
food, for example, which is --

00:57:42.730 --> 00:57:44.030
would go with the Mizrachi.

00:57:44.030 --> 00:57:49.460
You get that in Rome
and in -- and in Israel.

00:57:49.460 --> 00:57:51.930
And you -- and you -- that's
one of the cuisines that's going

00:57:51.930 --> 00:57:53.620
to really be going
because there's no --

00:57:53.620 --> 00:57:55.310
there are no Jews anymore in Libya.

00:57:55.310 --> 00:57:58.100
There are no Jews in Iraq.

00:57:58.100 --> 00:58:02.410
So with all the intermarriage
between different kinds of Jews

00:58:02.410 --> 00:58:07.430
and between Jews and
non-Jews, a wonderful cuisine

00:58:07.430 --> 00:58:10.510
like Libyan food is harder to make.

00:58:10.510 --> 00:58:13.100
And a -- it's going
to go by the wayside,

00:58:13.100 --> 00:58:15.610
unless people like
me try to capture it.

00:58:15.610 --> 00:58:18.920
But I really -- and what
I did when I tried to do

00:58:18.920 --> 00:58:23.280
when I'm testing recipes, I test
them like on a Friday or Thursday

00:58:23.280 --> 00:58:26.770
and Friday, like maybe
six or seven recipes.

00:58:26.770 --> 00:58:29.190
And then I invite people
for Shabbat dinner.

00:58:29.190 --> 00:58:33.920
And then they -- some
of them I really trust

00:58:33.920 --> 00:58:36.950
because they'll be honest with me.

00:58:36.950 --> 00:58:40.240
And I think would I ever
want to make this again?

00:58:40.240 --> 00:58:43.820
Because you -- I'm writing
a cookbook for people,

00:58:43.820 --> 00:58:45.950
and if you don't want to write --

00:58:45.950 --> 00:58:49.270
you don't want to make that
recipe again, then forget it.

00:58:49.270 --> 00:58:53.480
So that's what I do, and
it really works for me.

00:58:53.480 --> 00:58:57.530
Some people send out the recipes,
but I like having a connection

00:58:57.530 --> 00:59:02.510 position:56%
to my books and to, you know, what's
in the books, and make it part

00:59:02.510 --> 00:59:04.150
of my life because I can --

00:59:04.150 --> 00:59:06.250
you know, you can always
tell the stories

00:59:06.250 --> 00:59:08.150
that go behind all these recipes.

00:59:08.150 --> 00:59:10.510
So thank you very much.

00:59:10.510 --> 00:59:15.290
