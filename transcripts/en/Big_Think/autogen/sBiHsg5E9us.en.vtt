yeah so we have a set of principles we

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:12.490
yeah so we have a set of principles we
 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:14.220
yeah so we have a set of principles we
don't write them down anywhere really I

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:14.230
don't write them down anywhere really I
 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:15.810
don't write them down anywhere really I
mean they have been written down but we

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:15.820
mean they have been written down but we
 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.370
mean they have been written down but we
didn't set out to write them down I

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:17.380
didn't set out to write them down I
 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:19.380
didn't set out to write them down I
don't believe in like the whole like

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:19.390
don't believe in like the whole like
 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.960
don't believe in like the whole like
mission statement thing but we just want

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:21.970
mission statement thing but we just want
 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.060
mission statement thing but we just want
to build the simplest possible thing we

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:24.070
to build the simplest possible thing we
 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:26.249
to build the simplest possible thing we
can that solves a real problem like

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:26.259
can that solves a real problem like
 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:28.859
can that solves a real problem like
that's it for us we're always trying to

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:28.869
that's it for us we're always trying to
 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:30.359
that's it for us we're always trying to
solve simple problems with simple

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:30.369
solve simple problems with simple
 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:33.180
solve simple problems with simple
solutions and I think in general most

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:33.190
solutions and I think in general most
 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.549
solutions and I think in general most
things are really easy in life things

00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:35.559
things are really easy in life things
 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:36.959
things are really easy in life things
get hard when you make them hard

00:00:36.959 --> 00:00:36.969
get hard when you make them hard
 

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:38.280
get hard when you make them hard
but by default things are actually

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:38.290
but by default things are actually
 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:39.810
but by default things are actually
pretty simple I think companies

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:39.820
pretty simple I think companies
 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.460
pretty simple I think companies
unfortunately have been really good have

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:41.470
unfortunately have been really good have
 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:43.650
unfortunately have been really good have
been built to make things very difficult

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:43.660
been built to make things very difficult
 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.480
been built to make things very difficult
on themselves so we've kept our

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:45.490
on themselves so we've kept our
 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:49.200
on themselves so we've kept our
companies small intentionally so we can

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.210
companies small intentionally so we can
 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:50.970
companies small intentionally so we can
be a small company and do what small

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:50.980
be a small company and do what small
 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.410
be a small company and do what small
companies can do which is move quickly

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:52.420
companies can do which is move quickly
 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.090
companies can do which is move quickly
and come up with cool ideas and GEX

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.100
and come up with cool ideas and GEX
 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.920
and come up with cool ideas and GEX
acute them quickly and don't sorts of

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:55.930
acute them quickly and don't sorts of
 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:57.540
acute them quickly and don't sorts of
things and that's all around the

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:57.550
things and that's all around the
 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:58.920
things and that's all around the
principle of just doing the simplest

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:58.930
principle of just doing the simplest
 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:00.840
principle of just doing the simplest
possible thing we can to solve a real

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850
possible thing we can to solve a real
 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.000
possible thing we can to solve a real
problem one of the things I think it's

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010
problem one of the things I think it's
 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.039
problem one of the things I think it's
mixed up a lot companies are too

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:05.049
mixed up a lot companies are too
 

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:07.230
mixed up a lot companies are too
obsessed with innovation and not obsess

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240
obsessed with innovation and not obsess
 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.210
obsessed with innovation and not obsess
enough with usefulness so we're all

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220
enough with usefulness so we're all
 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.100
enough with usefulness so we're all
about like what can we do that's useful

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110
about like what can we do that's useful
 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:12.929
about like what can we do that's useful
not what's the latest technology what's

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:12.939
not what's the latest technology what's
 

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:15.059
not what's the latest technology what's
the crazy new thing but what's actually

00:01:15.059 --> 00:01:15.069
the crazy new thing but what's actually
 

00:01:15.069 --> 00:01:16.739
the crazy new thing but what's actually
useful and so that's really at the core

00:01:16.739 --> 00:01:16.749
useful and so that's really at the core
 

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:20.500
useful and so that's really at the core
of what we're all about

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:20.510
 
 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.570
 
well I think first and foremost were a

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580
well I think first and foremost were a
 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.090
well I think first and foremost were a
business now that's not always the case

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100
business now that's not always the case
 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.320
business now that's not always the case
because there are some that are

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330
because there are some that are
 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.050
because there are some that are
businesses you know like Google's very

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060
businesses you know like Google's very
 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.370
businesses you know like Google's very
successful of course and there's a few

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380
successful of course and there's a few
 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.230
successful of course and there's a few
others but for the most part a lot of

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240
others but for the most part a lot of
 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.310
others but for the most part a lot of
things that's going on in Silicon Valley

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320
things that's going on in Silicon Valley
 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.580
things that's going on in Silicon Valley
today are they're not businesses they

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590

may be businesses but you're not really
 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.780
may be businesses but you're not really
business if you're just losing money or

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790
business if you're just losing money or
 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.910
business if you're just losing money or
if you're not charging for things we

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920
if you're not charging for things we
 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.280
if you're not charging for things we
we're a traditionalist company we charge

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290
we're a traditionalist company we charge
 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:46.450
we're a traditionalist company we charge
for things we have a product when we

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460
for things we have a product when we
 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.430
for things we have a product when we
sell it we also have some free stuff too

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440
sell it we also have some free stuff too
 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:49.960
sell it we also have some free stuff too
but we're all about selling things we're

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970
but we're all about selling things we're
 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:51.580
but we're all about selling things we're
all about making money and so I think

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590
all about making money and so I think
 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:52.660
all about making money and so I think
that's one of the things that sets us

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670
that's one of the things that sets us
 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.300
that's one of the things that sets us
apart but also we're not big into the

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310
apart but also we're not big into the
 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.640
apart but also we're not big into the
idea of get raising earth money early in

a company's history we're not big into
 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.620
a company's history we're not big into
what's the latest technology that we

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630
what's the latest technology that we
 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:03.760
what's the latest technology that we
should be using we're not big into

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770
should be using we're not big into
 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.790
should be using we're not big into
staffing up quickly we're not big into

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:05.800
staffing up quickly we're not big into
 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.080
staffing up quickly we're not big into
marketing the traditional marketing and

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090
marketing the traditional marketing and
 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.210

we're not big into that stuff we're big
 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.550
we're not big into that stuff we're big
into building really great products for

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560
