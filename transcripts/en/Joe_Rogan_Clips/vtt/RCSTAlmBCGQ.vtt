00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.290
Would you say Denver's the best comedy town in the country.
It's up there.

2
00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.190
It's up there.
I fucking love it there.
I'm going there in August.

3
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.210
I'm doing that place again.
I fucking love it.
Yeah.

4
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:14.640
It's one of my favorite places on the planet period.

5
00:00:14.641 --> 00:00:17.880
Like if I was going to leave la,
Denver's one of the spots that I would pick.

6
00:00:17.881 --> 00:00:20.370
I think about like when I mentioned the leave,

7
00:00:20.371 --> 00:00:23.520
where would I go and Denver's a Denver's at the top of the list.

8
00:00:23.521 --> 00:00:27.210
I used to want to go to like Seattle or Portland and then I read that article,

9
00:00:27.211 --> 00:00:31.320
that terrifying article about how like not just like if we talks about the big

10
00:00:31.321 --> 00:00:33.240
one earthquake in La and they're like,

11
00:00:33.241 --> 00:00:37.060
what's really going to fuck shit up is the tsunami that's going to happen on

12
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.620
that bought line.
They're like,
Portland and Seattle are going to be gone.

13
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:43.890
When that tsunami 100% right?
100% yeah.

14
00:00:43.891 --> 00:00:48.340
It's just whether it's a hundred years from now or two [inaudible] Jesus.

15
00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:53.340
If we wake up one day in Seattle's gone,
13 million people dead.

16
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.030
It goes deep into Washington state all the way to Tacoma.

17
00:00:57.031 --> 00:00:59.040
The ocean goes to Tacoma.
Oh,

18
00:00:59.041 --> 00:01:02.000
that there was an article that they like talked about like what?
How,

19
00:01:02.001 --> 00:01:02.820
what would happen?

20
00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.030
Like what would happen like minute by minute in Portland with this,

21
00:01:06.031 --> 00:01:10.110
with this going on.
It was just terrifying.
Yeah.
Fuck that.
Too risky.

22
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.660
Also seasonal depression is real.
Oh,
for sure.

23
00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.820
I have a buddy of mine who moved to,
um,

24
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.380
he moved to Portland and started Jujitsu school out there and I was like,

25
00:01:19.381 --> 00:01:22.020
do you like it?
He was like,
dude,
I fucking love it.
I go,
you don't Miss La at all.

26
00:01:22.021 --> 00:01:25.530
He was like,
no.
I go,
what about the range of Bobby?
I was like,
no,
no.
It's nothing.

27
00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.890
Two years later,
he's back in La.
I go,
what happened?
He goes to fucking weather.

28
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.090
I go,
you liar.
I,
you would try to convince me.
You would try to tell me.

29
00:01:33.091 --> 00:01:36.840
And he started laughing.
He's like convincing myself.
Yeah,
he be,

30
00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:38.300
he bought into it.
He goes,
I go.

31
00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.840
What happened is I came back one time and when it was rainy out there and it

32
00:01:42.841 --> 00:01:46.830
wasn't rainy here and I was like,
what am I doing?
I go,
I'm less happy there.
