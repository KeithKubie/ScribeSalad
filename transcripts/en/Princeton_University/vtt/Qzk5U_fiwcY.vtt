00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.539
My name is Rob Melrose, 
and I graduated from Princeton in 1992.

00:00:18.765 --> 00:00:22.140
I majored in English, Program Five, drama ...

00:00:22.332 --> 00:00:25.357
and I also have a certificate 
in the program of theater and dance.

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:30.509
My name is Paige Rogers. 
I am a 1989 graduate of Princeton University.

00:00:30.733 --> 00:00:34.605
I also have the same degree, Program Five, 
theater and dance, English major.

00:00:34.956 --> 00:00:37.868
I was at public school as a young person,

00:00:38.142 --> 00:00:40.716
and there was a wonderful 
artist-in-residence program

00:00:40.894 --> 00:00:44.700
One artist brought in a painting 
by Rene Magritte.

00:00:44.877 --> 00:00:51.340
I just got so excited about surrealism 
and later on in life I asked teachers

00:00:51.564 --> 00:00:59.966
who wrote plays like these paintings, 
Magritte and Dali. That kind of set me off

00:01:00.188 --> 00:01:03.420
on my life-long journey 
of experimental theater.

00:01:03.676 --> 00:01:07.502
I was an in-coming freshman 
and Paige was a returning senior,

00:01:07.805 --> 00:01:11.468
and of course everybody got real excited 
because they knew Paige was in theater.

00:01:11.661 --> 00:01:14.140
Oh, this is great, this is great, you 
got to meet Paige, you got to meet Paige.

00:01:14.332 --> 00:01:16.349
Then here he comes it's like 
I want to know about theater.

00:01:16.556 --> 00:01:19.422
I said, "Oh yeah, yeah, okay, let's talk 
about theater," and I'm like,

00:01:19.548 --> 00:01:25.708
"Eh, ugh, cute freshman." 
I just didn't take him seriously at all.

00:01:25.855 --> 00:01:27.996
Because I was a senior 
I was deeply embarrassed

00:01:28.173 --> 00:01:30.668
to be dating this freshman. 
I really was.

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.525
We were only dating about two weeks 
when we realized we should get married.

00:01:34.702 --> 00:01:36.796
We're going to get married and let's 
have a, we're going to have a child.

00:01:37.117 --> 00:01:39.484
We never wavered and we never broke up.

00:01:39.885 --> 00:01:43.213
After my sophomore year we ran 
the Princeton summer theater together.

00:01:43.405 --> 00:01:45.102
He directed Twelfth Night 
and I was in it.

00:01:45.325 --> 00:01:47.918
I directed Larry Shoe the Nerd 
and he played the nerd,

00:01:48.142 --> 00:01:53.502
and we had a absolutely terrible time. 
It was a total failure. It was brutal.

00:01:53.694 --> 00:01:55.694
The fact that our relationship survived ...

00:01:55.885 --> 00:01:59.069
If we'd had crystal ball saying 
this is what you're going to do

00:01:59.277 --> 00:02:03.133
for the rest of your life. I think we 
would have run screaming from one another.

00:02:04.525 --> 00:02:11.789
For me, Michael Cadden was my JP advisor. 
Alan Mockler was my senior thesis advisor

00:02:12.046 --> 00:02:17.037
and I did a production of Miss Julie.
They were both very, very influential.

00:02:17.791 --> 00:02:21.021
My senior thesis was a production of 
The Seagull, and I also

00:02:21.277 --> 00:02:25.853
was the publicity manager and then 
the business manager of Intime,

00:02:26.061 --> 00:02:30.878
and I directed a bunch of shows at Intime. 
I directed Rhinoceros there

00:02:31.133 --> 00:02:33.453
and that was a huge experience for me.

00:02:33.774 --> 00:02:38.190
These kinds of plays are the plays 
that they get me the most excited.

00:02:38.381 --> 00:02:41.311
So much of what Cutting Ball's done, 
and what I've done in my career,

00:02:41.501 --> 00:02:46.142
are absurdist, they're 
existential playwrights.

00:02:46.815 --> 00:02:51.999
I got a grant from the Fox Foundation 
to spend three to four months in Europe

00:02:52.221 --> 00:02:57.725
to observe master European directors 
working on Shakespeare and translation.

00:02:58.046 --> 00:03:04.047
It was such a life-changing experience 
and we got really excited by the work

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:08.046
we saw there ... we said "Where can we go 
to do this kind of work?"

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:10.830
Rob always says that he explains to people
in the states, we run

00:03:11.086 --> 00:03:13.310
an experimental theater company 
in San Francisco.

00:03:13.501 --> 00:03:16.461
But if we lived in Europe we'd just say 
we run a theater company.

00:03:17.118 --> 00:03:19.695
We founded the theater together in 1999.

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:25.247
Our mission is to do experimental 
new plays, seminal avant garde work,

00:03:25.502 --> 00:03:27.695
and re-envision classics.

00:03:27.918 --> 00:03:31.118
The joke in the early years
was that Rob was the boss at the theater

00:03:31.295 --> 00:03:36.976
and I'm the boss at home. Just this past 
season Rob decided to take a sabbatical.

00:03:37.486 --> 00:03:42.527
Over the past few years a lot of my focus 
has been on directing elsewhere.

00:03:42.782 --> 00:03:45.950
I directed a play at Guthrie Theater,
Oregon Shakespeare Festival,

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:50.447
the Public Theater so we switched. 
I'm kind of the boss at home.

00:03:50.768 --> 00:03:52.142
You are.

00:03:53.342 --> 00:03:56.510
Paige is the boss here, 
and she's doing a great job.

00:03:56.736 --> 00:04:00.862
This piece that I'm working on currently 
is Calderon's "Life is a Dream."

00:04:01.134 --> 00:04:04.766
A big question for me about the piece 
is the jail that Segismundo lives in.

00:04:05.007 --> 00:04:08.576
The whole set is a jail and he's 
underneath it the whole time.

00:04:08.766 --> 00:04:13.342
I officially have a crush on my own set. 
I would lay in bed and I couldn't sleep

00:04:13.487 --> 00:04:17.761
and I'd think about my sets 
and imagine things happening with my set.

00:04:22.734 --> 00:04:24.366
We never stop talking about Cutting Ball.

00:04:24.591 --> 00:04:27.055
We're on a hike and a kid'll go, 
"Look, I got a gecko."

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.094
We're like, "Oh, that's amazing. Anyway, 
I think the matinee should be ..."

00:04:30.286 --> 00:04:33.886
We never, never stop.
