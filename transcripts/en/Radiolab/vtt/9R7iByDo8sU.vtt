1
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.760
Jad. Yeah, let me play you this buddy. Yes ma'am.

2
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:09.360
You're listening to Mike Nichols. I've been thinking and lane may,

3
00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:13.560
you're getting old and now you're nearly a man and you should start thinking

4
00:00:13.561 --> 00:00:15.060
about your future a little bit.

5
00:00:15.061 --> 00:00:18.780
You know you're listening to rehearsal that happened to get caught on tape.

6
00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:26.160
[inaudible] laughing about God's,

7
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.970
he has a joke in his hand. I know what I'd like to do with my life,

8
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.040
but he just can't get the punchline out without ruining it with all that I have

9
00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.280
to train for some years.

10
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.210
What was the journey or even here's a chair or you haven't heard it yet, but

11
00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.060
he wants to be when he grows up

12
00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.500
a registered nurse. The joke is I want to be a nurse. I wanted to be a nurse,

13
00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.280
but he can't say the word without,

14
00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:01.320
<v 1>without losing, nor can she say the word nurse and get that.</v>

15
00:01:01.321 --> 00:01:02.370
Is there a punchline

16
00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:04.810
<v 0>and why is that funny?</v>

17
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.280
You will remember it's 1959 and boys don't want to be registered nurses.

18
00:01:09.281 --> 00:01:12.900
Not In 1959 dots from Mike Nichols. The funniest thing he thought of all week.

19
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.390
You and pub. Not Funny, but he up.

20
00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.010
But a mother, I want very much to be a registered.

21
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.530
Yes. I love this. We heard so. I don't know why,

22
00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.090
but I could listen to this 150 pounds. I haven't listened to it. Not 50 Times.

23
00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.820
I want very much to be a registered nurse.

24
00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.200
So no, go on that one. Understand this.

25
00:01:44.201 --> 00:01:47.770
Laughter just keeps bubbling up. Mike can't control it.

26
00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.300
Ilene can't compel here.

27
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.380
<v 1>Here's the thing. These are two of the greatest humorist of the,</v>

28
00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.600
of the mid 20th century. The United States,

29
00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.530
they're professional improvisational comics. They live to laugh.

30
00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.090
They control if they try to create laugh, they're all about laughter and yet

31
00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:09.800
left and mix them.

32
00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.060
<v 2>Here we are the species with the capacity for language,</v>

33
00:02:14.061 --> 00:02:18.500
which allows us exquisitely nuanced expressions. This is Tyler Stillman.

34
00:02:18.501 --> 00:02:22.430
He studies laughter at Florida State University and yet we produce these kinds

35
00:02:22.431 --> 00:02:24.690
of bizarre samples.

36
00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:27.763
<v 1>Okay.</v>

37
00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.250
<v 2>No laughter is this kind of clumsy in articulate way of expressing ourselves,</v>

38
00:02:33.961 --> 00:02:36.750
but it's also kind of awesome.

39
00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.700
<v 0>So looking forward is the question then. Why is laughter so awesome? Oh,</v>

40
00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:46.160
highways, I hate that word. Awesome,

41
00:02:46.161 --> 00:02:49.940
but I will say that it's a good question to ask. Why do we laugh?

42
00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.680
What is laughter for and why those sounds, why those sounds. All right.

43
00:02:54.681 --> 00:02:57.500
Well let's go. Our topic today is laughter. I'm Jad Abumrad.

44
00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.550
I'm Robert Krulwich. This is radio. Great.

45
00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:05.283
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

46
00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:09.370
<v 0>okay, so to get started, that thing we just talked about,</v>

47
00:03:09.371 --> 00:03:11.140
the weirdness of laughter.

48
00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.500
You how it's both like I'm clumsy on one hand,

49
00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.700
but also kind of awesome. Yeah, I know you love that word. Awesome.

50
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.750
I'll see why you have to see that word delightful. Delightful is a great,

51
00:03:22.751 --> 00:03:23.290
delightful.

52
00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.110
What do I really want to say is that that sort of paradox is something that some

53
00:03:26.111 --> 00:03:30.100
of the greatest minds in history have thought about and written about.

54
00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.660
Like Aristotle in a book called [inaudible] Malian.

55
00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:40.470
Aristotle wants to describe what separates human beings out from all the other

56
00:03:41.201 --> 00:03:43.260
creatures. That's historian. Very Sandra's.

57
00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:45.970
He wrote a book about laughter called set and glory and according to him,

58
00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:50.260
after pages and pages of complicated reasoning about what makes us special.

59
00:03:50.261 --> 00:03:52.600
Is it language? Is it reason? Is it this? Is it that?

60
00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.530
Aristotle concludes one thing. What?

61
00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.080
What makes us absolutely different is our capacity to laugh.

62
00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.960
When you laugh [inaudible] go ahead and do it.

63
00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.050
That right there. Okay. That is a specifically human endeavor.

64
00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.440
No other creatures can do it. Not only that, the first time you do it,

65
00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.430
you mean like when your little paper at you just flew in your tiny baby and you

66
00:04:15.431 --> 00:04:16.210
make your first left.

67
00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:20.890
That to Aristotle might be the most important moment of your life because it's

68
00:04:20.891 --> 00:04:24.970
the moment that your life, at least as a human being begins.

69
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.140
When the infant utters its first left emits it's first left.

70
00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.260
At that moment,

71
00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:36.450
heated air from lower in the stomach moves through a membrane into the soul in

72
00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.983
souls

73
00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:43.270
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

74
00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:46.910
<v 0>and at that point then this is the fine distinction. At that point,</v>

75
00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:52.100
the creature moves from being a human into a human being.

76
00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:55.670
Yes, yes. He's absolutely, I remember it so clearly.

77
00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:59.780
The symbols that clashes, I think, oh, I'm a human being, but, and the but, but,

78
00:04:59.781 --> 00:05:02.910
but do you remember when it happened? No. Yeah.

79
00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:05.720
Well Aristotle was very specific about this.

80
00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:10.750
He thought it always happened or should happen on the 40th day of your

81
00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:11.923
existence.

82
00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:16.540
<v 3>Oh No,</v>

83
00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.990
today is your 40th day.

84
00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:23.080
<v 0>We wanted to check this proposition.</v>

85
00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:28.360
So we called up radio producer Amanda Aronne Aronchick who just had a brand new

86
00:05:28.361 --> 00:05:28.930
baby girl.

87
00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:32.080
<v 3>Nina is celebrating her 40th day of existence today.</v>

88
00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:33.640
We're going to get you to laugh now.

89
00:05:33.641 --> 00:05:37.620
Were you able to record with Mina this morning? Oh yeah. Oh yeah. No,

90
00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:41.890
we recorded for 50 minutes. Really? We just like went for it. And did she laugh?

91
00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:46.720
Well I tried pretty rob tried or aunt tried.

92
00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:50.550
Oh laugh. I went almost ugly.

93
00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.460
We all tried and tried to kind of harass her and like stick your tongue out

94
00:05:53.461 --> 00:05:57.890
editor and try to tickle her and then at the end she's like, ah,

95
00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:06.490
<v 1>we have yet to get a giggle out of her.</v>

96
00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:10.143
[inaudible]

97
00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:15.710
made some sounds we've never ever heard before.

98
00:06:15.711 --> 00:06:19.760
It sounds you're making like her level of interaction

99
00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:24.030
<v 3>in the last two days has been more than anything we've seen really. Like,</v>

100
00:06:24.031 --> 00:06:28.200
if you stick your tongue out at, or she does it back and if you open your mouth,

101
00:06:28.201 --> 00:06:32.460
she kind of tries to do that too. That has been a milestone, you know,

102
00:06:32.461 --> 00:06:34.920
aside from the actual day count, like it really is.

103
00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:36.900
She's becoming a little bien.

104
00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:46.600
<v 1>It's much more emotional.</v>

105
00:06:46.601 --> 00:06:50.440
It's like you're looking at this thing that you're deeply in love with and it's

106
00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:52.420
finally like looking back at you.

107
00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:57.160
<v 3>Yeah. Romanda when it happens, will you call us right back? Okay. I will.</v>

108
00:06:59.020 --> 00:06:59.520
<v 1>Oh,</v>

109
00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:00.950
<v 0>do you agree with Aristotle that,</v>

110
00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:05.610
that this is the ability to laugh is what literally separates us from the rest

111
00:07:05.611 --> 00:07:09.150
of the animal kingdom? God, how can I disagree with Aristotle? That would be,

112
00:07:09.151 --> 00:07:11.730
you know, blasting has, but none as an academic. I mean, you as a person,

113
00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:14.730
as a person. Um, I, I w I,

114
00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:18.130
I truly believe we're the only creature that laughs.

115
00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:20.390
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

116
00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:21.860
<v 0>what about you? I,</v>

117
00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:26.090
I do think there's something about the way we laugh,

118
00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:30.980
the way we share, uh, the emotional feeling that leads to left.

119
00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:34.070
That is kind of, I don't know of any other creatures that do that.

120
00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:39.410
You can't do that to me. I don't know if we're,

121
00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:44.440
I don't know if it's wrong because in all honesty that this scientific debate is

122
00:07:44.781 --> 00:07:45.650
still a,

123
00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:48.860
the jury is still out on this question whether we are the only ones that laugh,

124
00:07:48.861 --> 00:07:52.160
but it's one of those things that if you poke around a bit and let's poke,

125
00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:56.090
shall we? Okay. We'll be beside you. The question becomes much more complex.

126
00:07:56.870 --> 00:08:01.130
Okay. So, uh, introduce yourself so I don't, I don't mangle your name too badly.

127
00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:06.270
<v 3>Oh, absolutely. Uh, my name is Jaak Panksepp Jaak Panksepp. Yes. Yup.</v>

128
00:08:06.271 --> 00:08:10.170
Panksepp is a neuroscientist at Washington State University and for the last 30

129
00:08:10.171 --> 00:08:14.940
years he has studied animal emotion particularly, and this is his specialty.

130
00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:19.500
Have Penis in play, play playfulness in rats, for example,

131
00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:22.920
to do acts play. Yeah. Oh yes.

132
00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:25.530
When they're still young and you put them together,

133
00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:28.110
they start tussling immediately.

134
00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:33.320
<v 0>Well, when they play, they're silent. I mean, no, we got no squeaks or anything.</v>

135
00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:35.810
[inaudible] all the while they're headbutting each other.

136
00:08:35.811 --> 00:08:39.110
They're flipping each other over. They play really hard. No,

137
00:08:39.111 --> 00:08:40.850
sounds [inaudible] that's our starting point. Okay.

138
00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:45.140
So one day Jaak Undergrad students are standing in front of a rat cage washing

139
00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:48.560
two rats wrestle silently. And the Grad students,

140
00:08:48.561 --> 00:08:51.950
guy by the name of Brian [inaudible] says, is it really possible?

141
00:08:51.951 --> 00:08:53.630
They're not making any noises. I mean, look at them.

142
00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.100
Maybe they're making sounds, but we

143
00:08:56.100 --> 00:09:00.180
<v 3>just can't hear them. So he suggested to [inaudible],</v>

144
00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:02.730
why don't we order one of these little black boxes?

145
00:09:02.731 --> 00:09:06.300
They call them back detectors, nature. People used to listen to bets.

146
00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:08.160
What if we put one on the rat cage?

147
00:09:08.161 --> 00:09:11.700
Maybe it will take whatever sounds might or might not be there,

148
00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:15.930
lower them down to arrange that humans can hear. No. I said, okay,

149
00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:21.140
we'll buy the equipment and the equipment arrived and the first day we had a

150
00:09:22.051 --> 00:09:26.700
couple of animals playing and we tuned it through the various frequencies and lo

151
00:09:26.701 --> 00:09:30.690
and behold, it's like our playground f 50 killer.

152
00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:33.440
What did it sound like? It's like,

153
00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:35.940
<v 5>could you, did you [inaudible]?</v>

154
00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:36.793
<v 6>Did you take it?</v>

155
00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:45.330
So all of a sudden you just heard this sound erupt from little box? Yeah,

156
00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:47.390
absolutely. Wow.

157
00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:55.770
<v 3>So now they had the sound that no one had ever heard before.</v>

158
00:09:55.771 --> 00:09:57.330
And there's two things you need to know. First,

159
00:09:57.690 --> 00:10:00.720
the rats would make the sound sporadically.

160
00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:05.400
Each villa rap would make it just like chicken chip, chip, chip, and second,

161
00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:09.210
y'all had no idea what the sound was. What did it mean? What does it mean?

162
00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:11.580
What does it, what are they saying? What are they saying to each other?

163
00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:15.390
They knew had something to do with play, but was it just like a, hi, hi, hi.

164
00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:19.080
Or was it something more aggressive? Like you want a piece of me, let's wrestle.

165
00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:22.860
That's what I think. Or maybe they're excited and they're saying, give me sex.

166
00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:24.053
I want to have sex.

167
00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:27.840
So I think [inaudible] a couple of chirps and maybe it was just a grunt of some

168
00:10:27.841 --> 00:10:31.440
sort. There's a lot of possibilities. 10 years, 10 years.

169
00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:34.290
They studied this sound trying to figure out what it means.

170
00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:38.250
And every theory failed somehow. Well, nothing was conclusive. [inaudible].

171
00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:41.190
Then one morning yuck walks in to the lab,

172
00:10:41.191 --> 00:10:45.030
which she showed us her going to the animal facility on the fifth floor with a

173
00:10:45.031 --> 00:10:49.650
crazy idea. One morning I came in and says, yes, his Grad student at the time,

174
00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:51.960
Jeff, let's go tickle some rats.

175
00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:57.360
What on Earth gave you that idea? I don't know.

176
00:10:57.390 --> 00:11:02.160
This is the mystery of having a new idea. Oh, okay.

177
00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:06.110
So he and his Grad student quickly walk over to the rat cage, pick up a rat,

178
00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:10.670
and we carry it to a box. We put it in the box. Okay.

179
00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:15.210
The animals going in and I began to tickle it. Am I tickle?

180
00:11:15.211 --> 00:11:18.390
It's just like you. You would tickle the baby. Meaning what? Like could you,

181
00:11:18.391 --> 00:11:19.860
could you, could you cool with the fingers,

182
00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:23.250
but you're moving your fingers rapidly all over.

183
00:11:23.251 --> 00:11:27.960
The animal's body or some male ran demonstrated tickle

184
00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:36.940
<v 6>sound. The chemo is the same as before,</v>

185
00:11:36.941 --> 00:11:41.770
but now it was louder. More continuous. You can see how consistent it is.

186
00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:46.800
Plus it had this very familiar rhythm and familiar dynamic quality.

187
00:11:47.051 --> 00:11:51.880
The way it went in for the first time it occurred to,

188
00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:54.040
Yuck. I'm like, God, if that's last year,

189
00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:58.420
what if that sound is laughter and visually?

190
00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:00.850
I'm going to say it's pretty convincing when you see him do it.

191
00:12:00.851 --> 00:12:04.780
When you put a video on our website, radiolab.org when you see him,

192
00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:07.920
particular rat and the rat kick its little rat legs and Chirp like mad.

193
00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:12.560
It does look at the animals cracking up like a little kid. Yeah.

194
00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:18.300
<v 1>Oh, oh, oh,</v>

195
00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:24.620
oh, oh,

196
00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:26.670
oh.

197
00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:30.540
<v 3>To where you're thinking at this moment we were thinking this afloat.</v>

198
00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:33.300
It's a fluke. This afloat. UFC didn't trust what you were hearing.

199
00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:37.470
Oh well we trust what we're hearing, but I said, let me get another animal gay.

200
00:12:37.471 --> 00:12:41.550
Here's another rent ready for a tickle session. Tickle.

201
00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:47.700
Whoa. Syngo exactly the same. [inaudible]. Exactly.

202
00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:50.970
I still kind of said, come on, this is too good to be true.

203
00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.670
Let me again another animal. You tickle

204
00:12:55.960 --> 00:13:00.490
<v 6>exactly the same Jeff. Here's the kicker.</v>

205
00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:04.540
<v 3>The moment Jaak stops tickling the rats moves his hand away.</v>

206
00:13:05.170 --> 00:13:09.070
The rat starts chasing his hand and moves his hand left. The rat goes, left,

207
00:13:09.071 --> 00:13:11.710
moves in hand, right. The rack goes right. Exactly.

208
00:13:11.711 --> 00:13:15.700
The animal is glued to your hand because it wants to be tickled again at once

209
00:13:15.701 --> 00:13:19.720
more. Exactly. So cool. Whoa, hold on.

210
00:13:19.721 --> 00:13:23.500
I'm just running circles with my hand and the animals running circles right

211
00:13:23.501 --> 00:13:26.770
after my fingers. One, some more. Whoa. Whoa. Okay.

212
00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:30.700
And if you stop tickling and you just leave your hand there in the cage,

213
00:13:30.701 --> 00:13:32.410
like a dead piece of meat,

214
00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:37.800
the animal knows you're alive and gradually it begins to pounce on your head and

215
00:13:37.871 --> 00:13:40.680
it begins to nip at your face. It's like, come on. Come on, dude.

216
00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:44.030
<v 6>Does that, actually, let me ask you this though.</v>

217
00:13:44.510 --> 00:13:49.510
In terms of calling the squeaking a squeak or a Chirp or a cheat sheet or

218
00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:52.670
whatever you want to call it, that would be one thing,

219
00:13:52.671 --> 00:13:55.550
but to call it laughter is saying something very specific.

220
00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:58.960
<v 3>Yeah. A lot of people don't like that word. Huh? Oh.</v>

221
00:13:58.961 --> 00:14:03.820
Even my friends have advised me to drop that word because they don't think that

222
00:14:03.821 --> 00:14:06.550
a rat can feel joy or is that, is that,

223
00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:11.400
is that what giving human qualities to animals has been unknown? No.

224
00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:15.850
Since we are closer to the angels than the other creatures in the world.

225
00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:20.653
<v 1>Uh,</v>

226
00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:33.810
<v 3>ah. To laugh is to be an angel. He was kidding by the way. Oh really?</v>

227
00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:37.020
Oh. So I kind of believed him. Oh, you think that he was being,

228
00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:41.190
I thought he meant the laughter in the subtle way that he imagined. No, no, no,

229
00:14:41.191 --> 00:14:44.970
no. He thinks human laughter is not special. He thinks the Aristotle's wrong.

230
00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:47.550
Basically. Check it out. Aristotle do an experiment.

231
00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:51.710
Like it goes back a long way back to rats. Back to pigeons knows

232
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:56.660
<v 0>and that all these creatures laugh like us and they laugh more or less for the</v>

233
00:14:56.661 --> 00:14:59.970
same reason as us. Hmm. I don't know.

234
00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:03.620
Utila pigeon a good chicken crossing new joke and you're going to get nothing.

235
00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:07.020
Why? Why do you don't think that a pigeon has a rich emotional life? No,

236
00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:10.870
not joy. I have taught with pigeons. Let me tell you. [inaudible] all right.

237
00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:14.420
I'll give it that. We probably laugh for irony. Yeah, we, we'd probably do that.

238
00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:18.040
And like you think of Legend last for delight. I don't know. But sure.

239
00:15:18.041 --> 00:15:20.570
A pigeon experiences delight. What do you know you're not a pigeon?

240
00:15:20.610 --> 00:15:23.270
You forget the pigeon and a k. Oh, take a bird that sings. I bet.

241
00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:28.100
I bet birds sing because they're happy and singing is probably in a way like

242
00:15:28.101 --> 00:15:30.960
laughing. Oh, if you're going to get all general, I'm the, yeah,

243
00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:35.530
it was like the wiggle and wiggling. It's kind of like

244
00:15:37.290 --> 00:15:40.560
why would my day, what's happened to the bay to Baby Amanda? You mean,

245
00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:45.500
did she laugh yet? Yeah. Uh, no, actually not.

246
00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:49.310
Oh see, so Aristotle's really in deep doodoo here. I mean these days,

247
00:15:49.311 --> 00:15:50.330
I don't know about ancient Greece,

248
00:15:50.331 --> 00:15:54.560
but these days people who study this stuff say it's usually around 90 days.

249
00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:57.500
What is, what else? What's the general time at the time?

250
00:15:57.501 --> 00:15:59.900
So I told her to call us back when, when she does laugh.

251
00:16:00.090 --> 00:16:02.100
<v 7>Message one. Hey there.</v>

252
00:16:02.430 --> 00:16:07.430
Jad It's Amanda Roger Calling and I am calling to say that Nina just laughed.

253
00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:14.100
She just laughed. She actually full on did a life. Ha ha ha.

254
00:16:14.970 --> 00:16:18.630
Like that. Um, it was incredibly exciting. Um,

255
00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:23.460
but it was not day 40. It was day by my calculations. 97. So,

256
00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:27.420
uh, I don't know about Aristotle and those babies,

257
00:16:27.421 --> 00:16:30.330
but I'm this baby here left for real.

258
00:16:30.331 --> 00:16:33.240
Definitely 100% on day 97.

259
00:16:33.510 --> 00:16:38.160
So it's very exciting and we're very excited and now she's crying cause there

260
00:16:38.161 --> 00:16:41.250
was so much effort to laugh. I think I'm okay.

261
00:16:42.750 --> 00:16:43.710
And this message

262
00:16:43.810 --> 00:16:47.710
<v 8>now for the next question, forgetting for a moment how we laugh.</v>

263
00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:50.020
Let's ask why we laugh.

264
00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:52.360
<v 0>[inaudible] and I'll tell you why we laugh. Why do we laugh?</v>

265
00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:54.190
We laugh cause something's funny. No,

266
00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:55.000
<v 8>no, no, no.</v>

267
00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:59.400
The most important thing to remember about laughter is that it's social and it's

268
00:16:59.401 --> 00:17:00.750
not about humor.

269
00:17:00.751 --> 00:17:03.840
That's Robert [inaudible] and euro scientist at the University of Maryland who

270
00:17:03.841 --> 00:17:05.350
got very interested in this question led.

271
00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:08.970
So he went out on the street with some of his Grad students pen in hand and they

272
00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:14.070
listen or what people actually in real life say just before they laugh.

273
00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:17.130
And in 85% of the cases are you editing this down?

274
00:17:18.690 --> 00:17:23.030
85% of the cases. Nothing funny. Proceeded the laugh. Yeah. So, first of all,

275
00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:25.500
if people weren't really telling jokes to other people,

276
00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:30.390
they were saying things like, Hey, what are you being on? I've got to go now.

277
00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:33.710
I have a class, I have a class. Yeah.

278
00:17:34.170 --> 00:17:36.990
This is the kind of things that people, uh, say before their life.

279
00:17:36.991 --> 00:17:39.470
Now don't take my word for this. [inaudible] our cocktail party.

280
00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:40.920
You're going to be a lot of laughter there,

281
00:17:40.921 --> 00:17:43.870
but people are not telling jokes to each other to furious. Right?

282
00:17:44.010 --> 00:17:46.590
So laughter isn't about joking. It's about something else.

283
00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:50.220
It's about social relationships. You gotta have those people there.

284
00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:53.040
When you're alone. Laughter basically disappears

285
00:17:54.810 --> 00:17:58.740
when you're at home alone. Jad do you ever find yourself laughing? No. No.

286
00:17:58.741 --> 00:18:01.560
I sell. Yeah. Do you see sometimes when,

287
00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:03.280
like when I'm watching the TV or something like that,

288
00:18:03.281 --> 00:18:06.180
I can kind of vicarious social stimulus.

289
00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:11.130
I mean like when you are solitary, if you take away media, no radio, no TV,

290
00:18:11.131 --> 00:18:12.270
no nothing in your ears,

291
00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:18.000
no laughter basically disappears. So we have an unconsciously controlled,

292
00:18:18.001 --> 00:18:20.880
neurologically programmed social behavior.

293
00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:24.810
The will only work if there's a sharer, even if the share is just in your head.

294
00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:29.490
Yep. And neurologic neurologically programmed by who? By M evolution.

295
00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:31.500
In this case. At towards the end of the interview,

296
00:18:31.501 --> 00:18:35.460
he walked me over to his a TV VCR thing. He has state of the art stuff.

297
00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:36.570
This is for any fancy,

298
00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:40.290
and you showed me a video of a woman tickling a chimpanzee. What is this?

299
00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:44.550
I have an example here of laughter from our primate ancestors,

300
00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:45.720
baby chimps.

301
00:18:52.290 --> 00:18:52.451
<v 9>Okay.</v>

302
00:18:52.451 --> 00:18:56.110
We have now a chimpanzee on the screen and you're listening to a chimpanzee

303
00:18:56.111 --> 00:19:01.060
playing with a, a a woman after you get a game going, that's the woman laughing.

304
00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:06.490
She is now puddling and smothering the chimp with the tugs

305
00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:10.570
and he's being tickled.

306
00:19:14.290 --> 00:19:18.640
That's chimpanzee laughter at panning sound. You hear it?

307
00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:23.500
<v 8>Chimpanzee laughter. A low level of chimpanzee panting, laugh too. I'd be like,</v>

308
00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:24.383
yeah,

309
00:19:24.970 --> 00:19:25.550
<v 1>okay.</v>

310
00:19:25.550 --> 00:19:27.820
<v 8>When they really get into it, it becomes more guttural. Like</v>

311
00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:33.620
<v 1>that sound that sound</v>

312
00:19:34.050 --> 00:19:35.960
<v 8>bovine things. It has nothing to do with jokes.</v>

313
00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:38.940
This is not a reaction to any other. The tickling is kind of delightful. Yeah.

314
00:19:39.050 --> 00:19:40.670
<v 10>But what it really is doing,</v>

315
00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:45.140
he says that particular sound is a signal, one chimp to the other,

316
00:19:45.141 --> 00:19:48.800
and those two chimps to any other animals that happened to come by other chimps.

317
00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:52.970
We're just playing Shims have evolved.

318
00:19:52.971 --> 00:19:54.410
It's taken them a long time,

319
00:19:54.411 --> 00:19:57.350
but they figured out a way to signal we're not fighting,

320
00:19:57.700 --> 00:20:02.450
I'm not going to kill you. This is just play. It's the signal of we're just,

321
00:20:02.670 --> 00:20:04.930
<v 8>I didn't get into it. It becomes more go safe.</v>

322
00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:12.890
According to pro vine, we inherited that signal from our chimp relatives. Yeah.

323
00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:17.100
So basically panting became ha.

324
00:20:18.340 --> 00:20:19.630
Oh, in a human.

325
00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:25.230
We've just added one little wonderful extra the eight.

326
00:20:27.670 --> 00:20:28.503
<v 11>Sure.</v>

327
00:20:36.670 --> 00:20:37.810
<v 8>Alright. More than a moment.</v>

328
00:20:38.250 --> 00:20:39.450
<v 7>Message one.</v>

329
00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:43.860
A video lab is funded in part by the Alfred p Sloan Foundation,

330
00:20:43.890 --> 00:20:47.250
the corporation for public broadcasting and the National Science Foundation.

331
00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:51.450
Somebody who has tried to grab my sheet of paper. Okay.

332
00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:54.090
Video lab is produced by W N Y,

333
00:20:54.110 --> 00:20:58.450
Z New York public radio and distributed by NPR national public radio.

334
00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:00.533
You feel good?

335
00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:10.200
<v 8>This is Radiolab. I'm Jad Ben, Robert Today on our show.</v>

336
00:21:13.090 --> 00:21:13.860
<v 1>Laughter</v>

337
00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:15.420
<v 8>and what I want to say one more thing about this.</v>

338
00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:18.990
We talked about how laughter is evolutionarily sort of wired in.

339
00:21:18.991 --> 00:21:20.970
We've talked about that it's a social thing,

340
00:21:20.971 --> 00:21:22.890
a safety all clear kind of situation. Yeah,

341
00:21:22.891 --> 00:21:25.470
but it's another level of safety that's kind of fascinating.

342
00:21:25.650 --> 00:21:28.440
Let me tell you a really classic and not well known story.

343
00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:30.930
It involves the television showed the nanny.

344
00:21:30.931 --> 00:21:34.770
Remember in the nineties Fran Drescher had this very big hit TV comedy series.

345
00:21:35.490 --> 00:21:38.660
Well No, you will probably remember the voice of the dance.

346
00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:41.210
<v 1>Hello, that's Fran.</v>

347
00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:47.990
Well, what's the emergency mom?

348
00:21:47.991 --> 00:21:52.991
Mike Douglas isn't on Channel Four because they canceled him 22 years ago

349
00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:54.540
<v 8>and the story,</v>

350
00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:57.140
it actually is not so much about Fran Drescher as it is about the years.

351
00:21:57.310 --> 00:21:59.560
Those people laughing right under the wall constantly. Yes.

352
00:21:59.561 --> 00:22:03.370
Well this is about Franz laughers. It's a story of the nanny.

353
00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:04.413
<v 1>Last question.</v>

354
00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:09.750
<v 0>It begins with a woman named Lee set Saint Claire. Just FYI,</v>

355
00:22:09.751 --> 00:22:11.130
my name is pronounced Lizette.

356
00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:14.310
She's a casting director at central casting in Los Angeles.

357
00:22:14.311 --> 00:22:17.880
Central casting is the oldest extras casting company.

358
00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:20.910
It's been friend for years and years and years back in the day where people used

359
00:22:20.911 --> 00:22:24.460
to line up outside the studios and the productions would come out and pick you.

360
00:22:24.461 --> 00:22:28.890
You, you, she actually got her start as an extra. My first Gig,

361
00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:33.810
um, I think it was called the big house and I had to jump out of a coffin,

362
00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:37.950
but I was a hooker. I was a hooker out of a coffin. Anyway,

363
00:22:37.951 --> 00:22:41.850
after years as working as an extra Lizette decided to jump to the other side of

364
00:22:41.851 --> 00:22:45.590
the business and be the person in charge of casting the extras. No,

365
00:22:45.710 --> 00:22:48.270
you're on the phone and production company calls and says, you know,

366
00:22:48.271 --> 00:22:51.780
I need three strippers, two nurses and four doctors. And so that's what we do.

367
00:22:51.781 --> 00:22:52.614
We find them.

368
00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:58.440
<v 8>Now here's some more background that you will need. In 1985,</v>

369
00:22:58.441 --> 00:23:02.970
which is years before the nanny, Fran Drescher had been raped during a break in,

370
00:23:02.971 --> 00:23:03.804
at her apartment.

371
00:23:04.330 --> 00:23:07.350
And later she wrote about this experience and she spoke about it publicly.

372
00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:09.900
That night was the night that changed everything.

373
00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:12.750
This is Fran reading from her book, Cancer Schmancer.

374
00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:16.440
Two men with guns broke into our home and raped.

375
00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:18.510
Both me and my girlfriend Judy,

376
00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:21.390
who had the misfortune of having joined us for dinner.

377
00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:23.580
We were never the same again.

378
00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:29.840
The people who did this to her were caught and locked up and then things got

379
00:23:29.841 --> 00:23:31.820
worse. As her fame grew,

380
00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:37.310
she started getting stocked and this was right around the time that filming

381
00:23:37.311 --> 00:23:41.900
began on the nanny. And the thing about the filming,

382
00:23:41.901 --> 00:23:44.340
the nanny, when it's filmed live, as they say, you know,

383
00:23:44.350 --> 00:23:46.250
in front of a studio audience,

384
00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:49.400
pretty much anybody can come into the theater.

385
00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:54.880
So Fran worry that someone who might mean harm would come in and sit there

386
00:23:55.641 --> 00:23:56.550
during the shot.

387
00:23:57.350 --> 00:24:01.190
So she and the shows producers decided to do the only thing they could do.

388
00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:05.400
Get rid of the audience, just kick them out. Now,

389
00:24:05.430 --> 00:24:08.010
this was right in the middle of the season.

390
00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:10.170
They had a taping to do the very next day,

391
00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:14.400
no matter how hard things became in our personal life, the show must go on.

392
00:24:14.430 --> 00:24:16.420
So they called up Lizette.

393
00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:20.550
They decided instead of having an audience come in,

394
00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:24.420
just have people from central casting that they know. And she said, all right,

395
00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:26.880
okay, well I'll fill your audience with extras.

396
00:24:26.881 --> 00:24:31.200
I was looking for about 30 or 40 people you had thousands of people to choose

397
00:24:31.201 --> 00:24:33.980
from. And they're all kinds of categories available, right?

398
00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:38.280
You can do a search in the database, you know, height, ethnicity, weight,

399
00:24:38.281 --> 00:24:40.380
dress size, color, you know, hair color.

400
00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:42.780
You can put that all in and it'll bring up what you need.

401
00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:47.610
She needed a safe audience. No, just normal, lively people she could screen.

402
00:24:47.790 --> 00:24:49.410
And while she was at, she thought, well,

403
00:24:49.411 --> 00:24:53.490
why don't I get people who are good laughers? I mean, why not? Yeah.

404
00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:57.590
So with 24 hours to go, she put out a rather strange requests,

405
00:24:57.660 --> 00:25:00.110
put it out on the sequence where it's like a, it's like a work line, um,

406
00:25:00.210 --> 00:25:03.750
hotline that people listen to and if they fit or if they think they fit,

407
00:25:03.751 --> 00:25:07.620
then they'll call in. I said, hi, this is Lizette and I'm looking for a,

408
00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:10.650
some people that have good laughs to work on the nanny tomorrow.

409
00:25:10.730 --> 00:25:13.350
And when they'd call, she'd begin with one question. Hi,

410
00:25:13.351 --> 00:25:17.070
my name is a Donnie Mitchell. Okay, let me hear you laugh. Yeah. Okay.

411
00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:22.470
Hi, my name is Pam. Wes, let me hear you laugh.

412
00:25:23.310 --> 00:25:24.143
<v 12>Alright.</v>

413
00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:29.630
<v 8>My name is Kim January. Like you saw the funniest thing. Let me hear you laugh.</v>

414
00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:33.020
<v 12>My name is Dennis filer,</v>

415
00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:41.980
<v 8>the laundromat. She ended the phone right away. She goes, let's hear it.</v>

416
00:25:42.370 --> 00:25:43.203
<v 12>Yeah.</v>

417
00:25:45.090 --> 00:25:47.950
<v 8>Everybody in the laundromat looked at me and I said, it's an audition.</v>

418
00:25:47.951 --> 00:25:50.440
It's an orientation. I said left right now,

419
00:25:54.250 --> 00:25:54.960
Huh?

420
00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:59.450
<v 1>Oh. [inaudible]</v>

421
00:25:59.810 --> 00:26:03.260
<v 8>these were people that were crawling it that were like all ethnicities,</v>

422
00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:08.310
all ages twenty-something to like 70 something. I had married couples and,

423
00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:12.620
and it's, it's not a show like Baywatch where everybody has to look, you know,

424
00:26:12.621 --> 00:26:14.720
Bikini ready and all that, which means like,

425
00:26:14.721 --> 00:26:15.890
they weren't gonna win a beauty contest,

426
00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:19.610
but they could get to the studio and sit down and laugh.

427
00:26:19.670 --> 00:26:22.430
It was certain things that we were laughing at and they would come to us and

428
00:26:22.431 --> 00:26:24.770
say, okay, we don't want you to laugh at that.

429
00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:27.680
We knew when to laugh and when not to laugh.

430
00:26:27.681 --> 00:26:30.710
And then it got to the part where we just knew exactly what to do.

431
00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:33.860
Can you think of anything more wonderful than sitting in a comfortable chair all

432
00:26:33.861 --> 00:26:38.210
day long and being amused? People look pleasant. What do you mean a Laffer?

433
00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:43.180
So how much did you pay them back then it was like 75 bucks and you get paid.

434
00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:47.090
<v 13>We get paid for laughing. What a thing to do.</v>

435
00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:51.080
<v 8>Well does that got a bunch of the laughers in a room together just to show us</v>

436
00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:51.943
how it works.

437
00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:55.210
<v 0>So, uh, this is like a little kind of like a murmur, chuckle. Just,</v>

438
00:26:55.211 --> 00:26:58.090
it's not like a gut wrenching, just a little bit of murmur. Chuckle.

439
00:27:03.330 --> 00:27:04.163
<v 12>[inaudible]</v>

440
00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:07.340
<v 0>okay. Something just funny just happen,</v>

441
00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:09.240
but it's not like a whole big long laugh.

442
00:27:09.270 --> 00:27:11.040
It's just something really quick and funny.

443
00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:13.400
<v 12>[inaudible]</v>

444
00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:14.750
<v 0>and uh, this one,</v>

445
00:27:14.810 --> 00:27:17.570
something's happening and it's like a little bit of chuckle but then just

446
00:27:17.571 --> 00:27:19.550
something came out of it just making pee in your pants.

447
00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:26.660
<v 12>[inaudible]</v>

448
00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:31.570
<v 13>and we all have our great individual laughs, but we were told not to stand out.</v>

449
00:27:31.571 --> 00:27:34.720
So we had to know each other, play off each other.

450
00:27:34.721 --> 00:27:38.650
And if somebody was like paused in their laughter, maybe we'd cover it. I mean,

451
00:27:38.651 --> 00:27:41.020
we were a well-timed, orchestrated.

452
00:27:41.690 --> 00:27:42.260
<v 8>Yeah.</v>

453
00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:47.260
So well orchestrated that their it services became very desirable.

454
00:27:48.050 --> 00:27:49.040
You know, a chain reaction.

455
00:27:49.041 --> 00:27:53.210
Central casting began getting calls from other sitcoms on drew Carey show from

456
00:27:53.211 --> 00:27:56.300
talk shows sprinkled us in the audience.

457
00:27:56.330 --> 00:27:58.490
And something odd began to happen on the sets. The,

458
00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:03.030
the actors began noticing your life. Thank God,

459
00:28:03.490 --> 00:28:07.040
want to know if we are right. Did we have enough food? Was the food good?

460
00:28:07.041 --> 00:28:07.874
You know?

461
00:28:08.090 --> 00:28:11.270
And for a lot of these people who used to working as extras and being pretty

462
00:28:11.271 --> 00:28:15.980
much ignored all the time, this was wonderful.

463
00:28:16.010 --> 00:28:18.410
They treated us as though we were

464
00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:21.080
principal family.

465
00:28:21.081 --> 00:28:26.081
I mean they recognize us at Christmas parties and as just like we were part of

466
00:28:26.181 --> 00:28:30.050
them. Come and sit with and talk to us. You know, they appreciated us.

467
00:28:30.051 --> 00:28:33.620
So I asked the part I love, cause you know we've got their back. Yeah.

468
00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:34.700
And we did have their bag.

469
00:28:34.850 --> 00:28:39.850
There was a time we stayed after and it was a scene where the nanny was climbing

470
00:28:40.491 --> 00:28:45.491
a telephone pole outside and she wanted us to come out there and do a thing so

471
00:28:46.731 --> 00:28:49.490
that the timing was right and it felt right. And we,

472
00:28:49.530 --> 00:28:53.000
I think we went on 14 hours at night. It was wonderful. You know,

473
00:28:53.030 --> 00:28:55.790
almost want to cry because everybody's so wonderful as a family here.

474
00:28:55.950 --> 00:28:59.330
It's laughters and then reality struck

475
00:29:00.830 --> 00:29:03.990
<v 13>[inaudible] for a quarter. I bet. I'm feeling it.</v>

476
00:29:03.991 --> 00:29:07.420
Pure disgust with Tricia nominate

477
00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:13.820
George and Erica starting around 2000 reality TV. No,

478
00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:17.190
these shows have made it, no lapse required. They pushed,

479
00:29:17.191 --> 00:29:22.191
it comes aside and professional laughing work slowed down to a trickle and we're

480
00:29:23.161 --> 00:29:23.994
laughing

481
00:29:24.290 --> 00:29:26.840
<v 8>three times a week on different shows.</v>

482
00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:31.870
There is like this momentum and this adrenaline and suddenly it all comes to an

483
00:29:32.121 --> 00:29:34.370
end and it's like honest to God. It's like going through with it.

484
00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:40.540
<v 13>I found that when I'm not laughing I'm a lot more depressed and I found that I</v>

485
00:29:40.811 --> 00:29:42.190
found it was great therapy

486
00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:45.580
<v 0>for me on a weekly basis. I miss it. Oh God.</v>

487
00:29:49.150 --> 00:29:52.460
It's sad. How anybody out there needs any lab labyrinth.

488
00:29:52.690 --> 00:29:56.590
That's a whole room full of us. We look, we could use you,

489
00:29:56.591 --> 00:30:00.550
we could use you look at just the go with me here.

490
00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:05.170
What is Brown and sticky? Uh, what a stick

491
00:30:07.770 --> 00:30:10.840
and Jab. Yes. I had curios for breakfast this morning.

492
00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:17.410
This is Mulligan high grass at Jad. Yes, I am wearing brown shoes.

<v 14>[inaudible].</v>

502
00:31:00.150 --> 00:31:02.280
<v 0>Okay, so here's the question, Robert. Yeah.</v>

503
00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:06.720
In that story somewhere there was a guy who had like an amazing laugh. Well,

504
00:31:06.730 --> 00:31:07.531
they all have amazing lasts,

505
00:31:07.531 --> 00:31:10.680
but there was one particular guy who just had like an outrageous laugh.

506
00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:11.543
This one.

507
00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:16.990
<v 15>Yeah, that guy. What is it about that</v>

508
00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:20.560
<v 0>kind of laugh that just gets you like, what is it about this sound?</v>

509
00:31:20.590 --> 00:31:23.190
The laugh itself? Yeah. Well,

510
00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:28.030
I took that question to somebody who studies acoustics. Love laughing. Hello.

511
00:31:28.690 --> 00:31:32.170
Hi. Really? There's somebody who does that. Yep. I am Dr Joanne Beck rescue.

512
00:31:32.171 --> 00:31:35.110
I'm an associate professor of psychology at Vanderbilt University.

513
00:31:35.170 --> 00:31:36.970
She's from my hometown of Nashville, Tennessee,

514
00:31:37.030 --> 00:31:39.010
and I study the sounds that we make.

515
00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:43.840
She has collected over 30,000 laughs or so. Yes.

516
00:31:44.050 --> 00:31:45.850
Probably some, probably the biggest collection in the world.

517
00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:47.740
She's analyzed everyone on the computer in

518
00:31:47.950 --> 00:31:50.320
<v 16>play me a few. Okay. Just a little teeny scraps,</v>

519
00:31:50.321 --> 00:31:52.870
but I'll just go ahead and play this. Yeah, like this one.

520
00:31:56.220 --> 00:31:57.830
<v 15>Hey, sorry. Sorry to fail on Wednesday.</v>

521
00:31:59.910 --> 00:32:02.730
<v 16>It sounds hysterical. It like an alien,</v>

522
00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:07.980
but every bit of that laugh she thinks has a secret evolutionary purpose and she

523
00:32:07.981 --> 00:32:10.900
breaks it down from me. Starting with that first part of the laugh,

524
00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:15.570
a little breath you thing, which in her business, she calls a glottal whisky.

525
00:32:15.660 --> 00:32:19.680
She's still got this glottal whistle thing going on here, so I don't whistle.

526
00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:23.560
What's that again? It's the wheeze. Oh yeah.

527
00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:26.790
This is just creating turbulence in her. Gladys.

528
00:32:26.900 --> 00:32:28.920
It's like there's a storm going on down there. No,

529
00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:31.890
a lot of people do the wheeze when they left. I do y.

530
00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:35.580
It always happens at the beginning of a laugh always at the beginning,

531
00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:40.190
which makes her think that subclonal whistle seems really say, Hey,

532
00:32:40.191 --> 00:32:45.000
pay attention to me. And then you get this wonderful sound that follows.

533
00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:48.600
So the way she thinks, it's like a laughers gunshot to get you to listen up.

534
00:32:48.601 --> 00:32:51.820
Now. The sounds that follow, they jump around a lot. Yeah. Pitch,

535
00:32:52.130 --> 00:32:56.680
which again she thinks has a purpose considering when we talk, you know, we,

536
00:32:56.700 --> 00:33:00.360
we keep it right here in the middle. I'm Linda Worth Heimer no, no, no.

537
00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:03.730
When we laugh, we go up to fit it out.

538
00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:08.170
We leave crazy octaves and land on really, really high notes like this.

539
00:33:10.270 --> 00:33:13.210
This sound here and it's like a most squeak.

540
00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:18.300
This note in pitch is actually higher than the highest note in that famously

541
00:33:20.501 --> 00:33:24.370
unsinkable reo queen of the night, right? Yeah. Yeah.

542
00:33:24.670 --> 00:33:28.420
This laugh has got so much going on it acoustically extreme.

543
00:33:28.421 --> 00:33:30.290
That's what she [inaudible] calls it. Mystical, extreme laughter,

544
00:33:30.291 --> 00:33:32.960
which means that it's hard for our, our brains to process,

545
00:33:32.961 --> 00:33:34.760
and she seen this on brain scans.

546
00:33:34.761 --> 00:33:38.630
We get a little jolt a little when we hear a laugh that jumps pitches like that,

547
00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:43.520
25 hertz up to 276 hertz in a heartbeat.

548
00:33:43.550 --> 00:33:47.240
So maybe the pitch jumps, maybe the wheeze, these sounds, they're not random.

549
00:33:47.330 --> 00:33:52.330
She would argue they have specifically evolved to tweak US emotionally.

550
00:33:52.610 --> 00:33:56.450
Humans have the ability to produce a sound that makes other people feel good.

551
00:33:56.540 --> 00:33:58.100
And so if we can do that,

552
00:33:58.460 --> 00:34:01.760
then they're more likely to feel positively towards us and behave positively

553
00:34:01.761 --> 00:34:04.670
towards us because ultimately we want to shape their behavior towards us.

554
00:34:04.820 --> 00:34:09.200
Or what you're saying then is a laugh is a way of the Laffer getting into the

555
00:34:09.201 --> 00:34:14.000
head of or under the skin of the other person. Maybe just maybe studies.

556
00:34:14.001 --> 00:34:14.440
In fact,

557
00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:17.450
we've found that people laugh a little louder and more extremely around their

558
00:34:17.451 --> 00:34:18.710
boss and over and over.

559
00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:22.970
Joanne has found that women tend to exaggerate their laughs when they're around

560
00:34:22.971 --> 00:34:26.390
men, men that they don't know the stranger male she is,

561
00:34:26.450 --> 00:34:29.990
I'm laughing a lot and she is producing acoustically extreme laughter and you

562
00:34:29.991 --> 00:34:33.500
can interpret that in a lot of different ways. She interprets it as,

563
00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:37.790
as a safety thing. The idea being that male's inherently threatening.

564
00:34:38.060 --> 00:34:43.060
So you want to manipulate his emotional state so that he's positively disposed

565
00:34:44.781 --> 00:34:46.970
towards her or there's another way to sort of interpret that,

566
00:34:46.971 --> 00:34:50.450
which is that you're essentially confirming the stereotype of the giggling girl.

567
00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:54.350
Yeah. Um, the giggling girls have power,

568
00:34:56.560 --> 00:34:57.393
don't I know it.

569
00:35:00.270 --> 00:35:00.470
<v 12>[inaudible]</v>

570
00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:04.190
<v 17>and on that note, let's end this segment with author Barry Sanders,</v>

571
00:35:04.191 --> 00:35:08.810
who in his book said in glory writes a lot about this relationship between

572
00:35:08.811 --> 00:35:12.620
laughter and power and laughter as a way to stay safe.

573
00:35:15.390 --> 00:35:16.710
Yeah. Were there moments,

574
00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:20.000
early moments that you can remember where you felt that acute?

575
00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:23.810
<v 18>Oh, absolutely. I can, you know, I can s you, you can't see them with me,</v>

576
00:35:23.811 --> 00:35:28.010
but I can see them in my mind's eye. We'll pay that to fix your for me. Well,

577
00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:32.540
you know, there's a, there's my father absolutely. Um,

578
00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:38.080
utter the drunk and he's turning off the lights and turning on the lights in the

579
00:35:39.481 --> 00:35:44.481
house with such power that he's breaking the switches and sparks are flying in

580
00:35:44.671 --> 00:35:45.630
the house. You know,

581
00:35:45.631 --> 00:35:49.590
sparks are going around in the house and my mother is crying and I said, wait,

582
00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:54.300
it's fantasia. Everything's gonna turn, turn into coloring.

583
00:35:54.630 --> 00:35:57.280
Fantasia. I don't get it though because of the spot.

584
00:35:57.510 --> 00:36:00.180
Don't you remember in the middle of the movie? It just turns into technicolor

585
00:36:02.090 --> 00:36:02.350
<v 15>[inaudible]</v>

586
00:36:02.350 --> 00:36:06.340
<v 18>and there's sparks flying and there's magic wand going and Mickey starting to</v>

587
00:36:06.341 --> 00:36:09.670
touch things and they become vibrant and alive.

588
00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:12.580
That's what the house looked like to me. The house looked like magic mountain,

589
00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:14.320
you know, it was the 4th of July.

590
00:36:14.710 --> 00:36:18.580
So I tried to convert it that way with,

591
00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:21.990
with him and did actually worked.

592
00:36:22.650 --> 00:36:26.640
He took a few steps back, looked at the situation,

593
00:36:27.150 --> 00:36:29.190
any cracked up. I mean,

594
00:36:29.191 --> 00:36:33.450
I've always thought that anger and Latins are the root for things like anger and

595
00:36:33.451 --> 00:36:38.340
anxiety and Angina is a word called inks area, which means to be without air.

596
00:36:38.930 --> 00:36:41.410
In order you start your s, you know, you just start to choke up and you,

597
00:36:41.630 --> 00:36:45.270
you tell someone, hey, take a deep breath and laughter is about breath.

598
00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:49.960
After all, this is what Aristotle tells us and so that's what would happen.

599
00:36:49.961 --> 00:36:53.610
He stopped for a second, he shoulders would go down, he would relax,

600
00:36:53.611 --> 00:36:58.410
he would move from out of his throat into his belly and laugh at the situation.

601
00:37:01.660 --> 00:37:03.250
<v 13>Radio level of return in a moment.</v>

602
00:37:03.790 --> 00:37:06.520
This is Candice currently calling from her bicycle.

More information aboutSloan@wwwdotsloan.org thank you.

607
00:37:29.290 --> 00:37:30.620
<v 18>This is Radiolab. I'm Jan,</v>

608
00:37:30.870 --> 00:37:33.640
I'm Ron and I'm Robert Krulwich and this hour we are looking at

609
00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:35.333
<v 1>left.</v>

610
00:37:36.410 --> 00:37:40.130
<v 18>Oh, who is that? Okay. Here we have the laugh box.</v>

611
00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:43.730
That's a strange little device that Robert provide from University of Maryland

612
00:37:43.731 --> 00:37:45.180
Plate member him from the previous sector. Yeah.

613
00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:49.680
<v 1>Any other notion about this? Yeah, so basically you just need laughter,</v>

614
00:37:49.770 --> 00:37:50.910
you know, cause what happened?

615
00:37:51.380 --> 00:37:54.150
Your notion here is you don't need a joke to start the laugh.

616
00:37:54.390 --> 00:37:58.850
All you need is a laugh. You can throw the joke away. Laughter causes laughter.

617
00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:02.850
No, you can't get a laugh going from nothing. Well actually actually you can.

618
00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:04.270
<v 18>And he said, I'll prove it to you.</v>

619
00:38:04.390 --> 00:38:07.810
So he showed me a video tape this was at in the mall.

620
00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:12.940
<v 15>Excuse me. Hi. We're doing a study on the laugh. Laughter. A good thing.</v>

621
00:38:13.870 --> 00:38:18.220
Absolutely. You'll laugh a lot. I laugh every day. Making a white platform.

622
00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:23.050
What do you do that makes him laugh? Trip.

623
00:38:24.550 --> 00:38:29.430
She goes a lot of things. What are the things?

624
00:38:29.431 --> 00:38:32.290
We have a piece of apparatus here. You push the button close.

625
00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:47.273
Why were you, what?

626
00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:54.160
Did anyone tell a joke? Anyone do anything funny?

627
00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:07.430
<v 0>He's, he was true. Provide is absolutely correct about this.</v>

628
00:39:07.580 --> 00:39:11.360
What we're dealing here is something that's very contagious.

629
00:39:11.850 --> 00:39:16.100
<v 9>He laughing [inaudible] and I'm</v>

630
00:39:17.750 --> 00:39:18.583
[inaudible].

631
00:39:18.630 --> 00:39:21.560
<v 17>All right. Well, while we were on the subject of a contagious laughter,</v>

632
00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:22.690
I've got a story to tell you

633
00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:28.673
<v 9>[inaudible]</v>

634
00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:32.440
<v 17>going to all right, and now imagine you Whitney.</v>

635
00:39:32.990 --> 00:39:36.860
<v 0>Imagine 1968 I go, you, I would just sit here. [inaudible] your attention.</v>

636
00:39:36.861 --> 00:39:37.400
I mean, oh yeah.

637
00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:42.400
1962 rural village of Kasha Tanzania girls boarding school girl is sitting in

638
00:39:43.041 --> 00:39:45.200
class. She begins to laugh.

639
00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:48.440
The girl next to her maybe turned left.

640
00:39:48.810 --> 00:39:49.521
<v 17>Here's her laugh.</v>

641
00:39:49.521 --> 00:39:53.910
And she begins to cross the classroom with their girl joins in and the teacher

642
00:39:53.911 --> 00:39:57.030
gets upset, but it's too soon. Four girls and eight,

643
00:39:57.031 --> 00:40:01.600
the entire class has began to laugh and then cry and then laugh and then crying

644
00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:02.593
and the cow

645
00:40:03.110 --> 00:40:06.470
<v 0>just cause I don't know [inaudible] anyhow, a girl outside at that moment,</v>

646
00:40:06.471 --> 00:40:08.420
walking down the hall, it's, imagine she hears,

647
00:40:08.510 --> 00:40:12.380
<v 17>did laughter from the classroom. She starts to laugh and she walks in,</v>

648
00:40:12.381 --> 00:40:16.340
laughs her laughter goes into other classrooms and soon the whole school is

649
00:40:16.341 --> 00:40:18.740
doing this. Laughing, crying, laughing, crying.

650
00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:23.420
Teachers cannot control these girls when they try to, the girls get violent.

651
00:40:25.370 --> 00:40:28.190
They could play one. Yup. And the principal then has no choice.

652
00:40:28.940 --> 00:40:29.930
He's got to close the school.

653
00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:32.720
<v 0>They opened the school a week later,</v>

654
00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:37.960
<v 17>it happens again, so they closed the school a second time.</v>

655
00:40:38.070 --> 00:40:41.130
<v 0>Meanwhile, the girls who started all this, they go back to their villages many,</v>

656
00:40:41.131 --> 00:40:43.710
many miles away and this thing, whatever it is,

657
00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:47.310
spreads up and down the coast of Lake Victoria. You mean?

658
00:40:47.311 --> 00:40:49.950
People in the villages start to play in one village,

659
00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:52.920
217 people start to laugh and cry.

660
00:40:52.921 --> 00:40:56.070
A second boarding school has to shut down and no one knows why.

661
00:40:58.280 --> 00:41:01.210
So a team of doctors, some British doctors in the area,

662
00:41:01.250 --> 00:41:04.970
they hop in a land rover and they rush out to investigate this strange

663
00:41:04.971 --> 00:41:06.140
phenomenon

664
00:41:07.020 --> 00:41:10.830
<v 2>and this is what they write. The Central African Journal of Medicine,</v>

665
00:41:11.100 --> 00:41:15.300
volume nine number five, May,

666
00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:19.140
1963 the disease commenced on 30th of January,

667
00:41:19.140 --> 00:41:20.730
1962 to mission one girls middle school.

668
00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:25.350
The onset is sudden with a tax of laughing and crying lasting for a few minutes

669
00:41:25.351 --> 00:41:26.240
to a few hours,

670
00:41:26.510 --> 00:41:28.040
<v 0>a maximum of 16 days,</v>

671
00:41:28.180 --> 00:41:33.110
followed by Russ spite and then a recurrence in the report. There is an account,

672
00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:34.130
a 52 year old

673
00:41:34.130 --> 00:41:38.150
<v 13>man who saw some people afflicted with a sickness and soon after turning to his</v>

674
00:41:38.151 --> 00:41:42.770
heart he felt something telling him to laugh and cry and shout this he continued

675
00:41:42.771 --> 00:41:47.570
to do for most of the night. No fatal cases have been reported.

676
00:41:48.350 --> 00:41:52.940
This is very, what is this true? Well, okay we wondered.

677
00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:58.270
So we sent our producer Ellen Horne 40 some odd years after the fact to see what

678
00:41:58.761 --> 00:42:01.930
she could find. I'm flying to [inaudible]

679
00:42:03.740 --> 00:42:04.251
to be honest,

680
00:42:04.251 --> 00:42:09.251
I was a little bit worried that I can see the sunset over Lake Victoria that uh,

681
00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:13.870
that the medical journal article just wasn't true. Yes.

682
00:42:13.900 --> 00:42:15.760
With assay that cause that hasn't cause what I expected.

683
00:42:15.761 --> 00:42:20.761
Was this a total hoax or then it was some kind of like stunned getting close.

684
00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:26.680
I just sort of doubted the general credibility of the, of the whole thing.

685
00:42:28.170 --> 00:42:32.040
Okay. We'll be correcting but Koba okay. So I get to the co Baptist,

686
00:42:32.190 --> 00:42:35.730
totally the most beautiful place. The cover is a tiny port town.

687
00:42:35.810 --> 00:42:39.780
It's green and lush and it's very remote part of northern Tanzania.

688
00:42:41.940 --> 00:42:45.870
And my first step was just to spend a couple of days walking around and asking

689
00:42:45.930 --> 00:42:48.900
everybody that I ran into who spoke English,

690
00:42:48.930 --> 00:42:53.220
so I'm asking about this contagious laughter, the demic of laughter,

691
00:42:53.710 --> 00:42:55.450
I guess I imagined, you know,

692
00:42:55.451 --> 00:42:59.170
this happened in the in the sixties so I'm looking for people who are like in

693
00:42:59.171 --> 00:43:03.780
their seventies and eighties it turns out that I didn't need the old people and

694
00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:06.750
young people totally new, but I was talking about, yeah,

695
00:43:07.930 --> 00:43:11.050
I totally know what you mean because it still happens today.

696
00:43:11.660 --> 00:43:12.920
The first time I saw it,

697
00:43:12.921 --> 00:43:17.921
it was in 1991 I went to this tour office and the first person I met there was

698
00:43:19.791 --> 00:43:20.640
this guy named marina.

699
00:43:22.090 --> 00:43:26.210
When he said he thought he could find me, somebody who had had,

700
00:43:26.211 --> 00:43:30.440
and maybe forgive me three hours, I can find out. I'll give you my phone number.

701
00:43:31.670 --> 00:43:33.440
About an hour later I get a text from him that says,

702
00:43:33.470 --> 00:43:36.320
meet me in a half hour hop in his car.

703
00:43:36.321 --> 00:43:39.980
We drive off to how did you find this person? I know everybody in town.

704
00:43:40.770 --> 00:43:42.920
Everybody knows he's not kidding.

705
00:43:42.921 --> 00:43:46.640
Raymond is a former Tanzania national soccer team star.

706
00:43:46.641 --> 00:43:49.790
He's like a local celebrity, like kids follow him down the street,

707
00:43:50.390 --> 00:43:54.680
so Raman drives me up this dirt road about 10 minutes we get to this blue summit

708
00:43:54.681 --> 00:43:55.514
building.

709
00:43:56.180 --> 00:44:00.470
We sit outside on the porch in these white plastic chairs and we just, we wait.

710
00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:09.070
Hello. After about 20 minutes, this woman comes out really beautiful,

711
00:44:09.130 --> 00:44:12.100
has a mole on her nose, long eyelashes,

712
00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:14.650
or she'll introduce herself for me.

713
00:44:14.740 --> 00:44:18.040
She's nervously squeezing this plastic water bottle that's in her hand.

714
00:44:19.900 --> 00:44:22.780
Stanton, Khan. Chester is her name of

715
00:44:27.010 --> 00:44:27.070
[inaudible].

716
00:44:27.070 --> 00:44:30.700
She tells me that in her high school there were three girls who were affected

717
00:44:31.240 --> 00:44:36.200
kinds of [inaudible] for all of them and happen during exams test. Yeah.

718
00:44:36.630 --> 00:44:41.610
What do you remember what the test was about?

719
00:44:44.130 --> 00:44:48.510
It was the morning of the math test. She remembers walking into the exam room.

720
00:44:49.020 --> 00:44:49.890
She sat down,

721
00:44:49.891 --> 00:44:54.300
she looked at her paper and suddenly Gwen and Mocad and insanity and something

722
00:44:54.301 --> 00:44:58.290
came over her. She started laughing and then she took off her clothes.

723
00:44:58.320 --> 00:45:00.240
She started undressing

724
00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:08.550
[inaudible] and then she said she doesn't remember much ups from that.

725
00:45:08.551 --> 00:45:11.910
She's told that she fought. When they tried to restrain her,

726
00:45:12.210 --> 00:45:16.170
she spent three days in the hospital. They would give her Ballium,

727
00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:20.370
make her pass out. Then she'd wake up, feel a little bit better for a while,

728
00:45:20.371 --> 00:45:25.050
and then it would come on again. She'd uncontrollably be laughing.

729
00:45:25.170 --> 00:45:27.300
Then they would give her more Valium. She'd pass out.

730
00:45:28.290 --> 00:45:29.880
Why do you think this happens?

731
00:45:35.250 --> 00:45:39.060
She says it happens for girls are not free.

732
00:45:39.660 --> 00:45:41.190
And so I asked her if she felt free,

733
00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:43.560
like I'm not even sure what they're talking about.

734
00:45:44.070 --> 00:45:45.780
But I asked her if she felt free and she said,

735
00:45:45.990 --> 00:45:48.540
need a quote or I can just tell when you live with your parents,

736
00:45:48.690 --> 00:45:51.750
what kind of your that age, no one's really free.

737
00:45:52.020 --> 00:45:55.350
She said she had a boyfriend and her parents wouldn't let her see him.

738
00:45:55.860 --> 00:45:57.960
But in the hospital when she had the laughing sickness,

739
00:45:58.170 --> 00:46:01.220
he was allowed to come visit and we definitely can beat it.

740
00:46:03.630 --> 00:46:08.630
So this girl has a crazy attack of laughing and then her boyfriend shows up and

741
00:46:08.761 --> 00:46:12.940
she's just fine. Well, we were more like, she's allowed to see her boyfriend.

742
00:46:12.970 --> 00:46:17.380
So it's about the while she's, I mean the real common association with this,

743
00:46:17.830 --> 00:46:20.590
with the sicknesses that it's a teenage girl disease.

744
00:46:23.140 --> 00:46:26.440
Yeah, yeah, yeah. A girl,

745
00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:31.740
16 to 20 d as Old crying and sometimes laughing doctor school nurse,

746
00:46:31.741 --> 00:46:34.770
a psychiatric nurse from the local hospital, a doctor,

747
00:46:34.980 --> 00:46:36.600
and they all said vaguely the same thing.

748
00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:40.740
The reason it happened was that it had something to do with the transitions of

749
00:46:41.670 --> 00:46:44.610
adolescence. And just out of curiosity, you're a girl.

750
00:46:45.420 --> 00:46:50.130
Is there something about this that makes sense to you? There is, yes.

751
00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:52.710
Out of Cura. Yeah, sure. She said, you know,

752
00:46:52.770 --> 00:46:57.770
you're just beginning to kind of negotiate your relationship to sex and boys and

753
00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:02.610
there's these new pressures and these new responsibilities that are really

754
00:47:02.611 --> 00:47:06.000
challenging. It's funny. Um, boys don't, don't have that problem.

755
00:47:06.001 --> 00:47:09.000
We just want to have sex and it's a crisis for girls.

756
00:47:09.550 --> 00:47:11.520
So it does kind of make sense. Okay.

757
00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:16.530
But it doesn't really explain anything about 1962 to me. Why not?

758
00:47:16.620 --> 00:47:21.330
Because in 1962 it wasn't just teenage girls, it was boys, it was men.

759
00:47:21.331 --> 00:47:24.840
It was villages full of people of all ages.

760
00:47:25.770 --> 00:47:27.390
So what explains that

761
00:47:28.930 --> 00:47:29.763
<v 19>[inaudible]</v>

762
00:47:31.210 --> 00:47:35.530
<v 13>personally for me, I had found a woman who was there,</v>

763
00:47:35.830 --> 00:47:36.880
hello, that's good.

764
00:47:36.881 --> 00:47:41.881
Through Gertrude is in her fifties she's got short loose curls and big smiles

765
00:47:42.580 --> 00:47:45.820
and in 1962 when the laughter epidemic struck her village,

766
00:47:46.450 --> 00:47:49.120
she got it to six CSO.

767
00:47:53.120 --> 00:47:56.710
Lillian, do you remember? I remember his, yeah. Share.

768
00:47:56.711 --> 00:47:59.920
Ever seen hundreds of people coming down with this strange affliction.

769
00:47:59.921 --> 00:48:03.190
I had took many forms. Some were laughing but lasting laughter.

770
00:48:04.630 --> 00:48:09.240
<v 6>Then laugh and cry at the same thing at the same time.</v>

771
00:48:15.010 --> 00:48:20.010
What happened to me was I was not able to talk crying only and then my eyes were

772
00:48:22.181 --> 00:48:26.530
closed as if there is a it gum on my eyes.

773
00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:32.490
So my mom, she carried me on her buck and they walked.

774
00:48:33.690 --> 00:48:38.180
<v 13>I walked over the hills when the mom carrying her on her back for hours and</v>

775
00:48:38.181 --> 00:48:41.600
along the way they ran into other people, boys, girls, men,

776
00:48:41.660 --> 00:48:46.660
even old Dylan's dozens of people all headed the same way of laughing,

777
00:48:46.881 --> 00:48:51.470
crying. I had been yet the skiing where they going to,

778
00:48:51.471 --> 00:48:54.830
the witch doctor did this, which I didn't know what else to do.

779
00:48:54.860 --> 00:48:59.330
When ne hundreds of people, she says converged on this woman's tiny hut,

780
00:48:59.390 --> 00:49:03.770
so do had going inside 10 by 10 in the house. They were fool.

781
00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:05.660
They hit to stay outside.

782
00:49:05.720 --> 00:49:09.800
They are mainly because there were so many people going, too many people.

783
00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:14.920
Those Daddy, what do you think the problem was? Oh,

784
00:49:15.400 --> 00:49:16.150
<v 6>okay.</v>

785
00:49:16.150 --> 00:49:21.150
I was asking my Erda was what was the [inaudible] they said that it was

786
00:49:23.591 --> 00:49:25.180
something like spiritual,

787
00:49:25.810 --> 00:49:30.810
a spiritual event because one year before this program there were certain

788
00:49:36.070 --> 00:49:36.903
insects.

789
00:49:37.080 --> 00:49:40.200
<v 13>Yes. She said that about a year before the laughter epidemic,</v>

790
00:49:40.650 --> 00:49:41.820
Caterpillar's had shown up.

791
00:49:41.850 --> 00:49:45.810
They were breeding in the sprayed all over the ground.

792
00:49:46.050 --> 00:49:48.000
There was this huge infestation.

793
00:49:48.180 --> 00:49:53.180
One of the explanations was that the people who got sick had walked across the

794
00:49:53.431 --> 00:49:57.990
Caterpillar [inaudible] these caterpillars and had killed them.

795
00:49:58.260 --> 00:49:59.700
As a result,

796
00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:03.930
the spirit of the caterpillars were possessing these that they do get this

797
00:50:03.931 --> 00:50:07.530
feeling now. She sort of dismissed that as not scientific,

798
00:50:07.531 --> 00:50:12.531
but maybe this caterpillar has hid [inaudible] bacterias which affected the Bri.

799
00:50:15.510 --> 00:50:15.840
Okay.

800
00:50:15.840 --> 00:50:20.490
This explanation that there was some sort of bacteria or virus I had already

801
00:50:20.491 --> 00:50:23.450
checked did out and gone to the government hospital

802
00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:26.420
to talk to the medical officer.

803
00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:31.580
They'd never found any physical costs for this in the medical importance,

804
00:50:31.610 --> 00:50:32.540
which was found,

805
00:50:32.810 --> 00:50:37.370
I'd even talked to a lab technician to the technician who had checked blood

806
00:50:37.371 --> 00:50:41.750
samples in 1962 everything was negative. They've tested the water supply,

807
00:50:41.751 --> 00:50:42.710
the food supply,

808
00:50:42.740 --> 00:50:46.220
you get people negative so that the caterpillar seemed like a dead end.

809
00:50:46.830 --> 00:50:47.850
So I tried a different tack.

810
00:50:48.570 --> 00:50:52.750
I asked Gertrude what was going on then at that time in your village and just

811
00:50:52.770 --> 00:50:55.770
thought about it for awhile and then she said, Dick, you're local. Well,

812
00:50:56.280 --> 00:50:59.880
of course there was independence, independence.

813
00:51:01.150 --> 00:51:01.290
<v 21>Whoa.</v>

814
00:51:01.290 --> 00:51:04.620
<v 13>For 40 years, Tanzania had been a British colony,</v>

815
00:51:05.070 --> 00:51:10.070
but the 1961 Tanzania had declared independence and this was right before,

816
00:51:10.470 --> 00:51:12.870
just weeks before that first girl started laughing.

817
00:51:13.930 --> 00:51:16.770
Kartra I don't know much about independence.

818
00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:18.600
What can you tell me about independence?

819
00:51:19.560 --> 00:51:24.560
[inaudible] experienced by then was people going alone,

820
00:51:25.110 --> 00:51:27.840
seeing think drums,

821
00:51:29.520 --> 00:51:32.960
<v 21>dancing, [inaudible]</v>

822
00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:35.880
<v 13>but the but from that,</v>

823
00:51:37.100 --> 00:51:41.370
tell me more routine dependence because I was very, very young.

824
00:51:43.180 --> 00:51:45.910
Gertrude said that she knew somebody who would remember more.

825
00:51:45.911 --> 00:51:49.900
Someone I should talk to. [inaudible] 71 year old man.

826
00:51:50.140 --> 00:51:54.640
Mr Sauce was Jesse thing. Dale, which looked at, he was the,

827
00:51:54.641 --> 00:51:58.870
which doctor's assistant may be. This man can help more than May.

828
00:52:00.300 --> 00:52:03.330
Do you want some coffee or something? Breakfast here first,

829
00:52:04.110 --> 00:52:07.590
how my very last day in, but Coba Raymond and I sat down with this man,

830
00:52:07.670 --> 00:52:11.130
which doctor's assistant. We met a restaurant near my hotel.

831
00:52:11.820 --> 00:52:12.810
It's a tiny guy,

832
00:52:13.230 --> 00:52:18.230
gray hair and big oversized suit and he filled in some of the missing pieces.

833
00:52:21.380 --> 00:52:24.540
When we tell him I want to know what he remembers.

834
00:52:24.630 --> 00:52:29.460
I asked him about the independence celebration that Gertrude described the one

835
00:52:29.800 --> 00:52:32.280
stress before the laughter epidemic Jedi Shawn.

836
00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:36.390
He painted a very different picture and I remember

837
00:52:41.400 --> 00:52:42.720
[inaudible], he was 26 at the time.

838
00:52:44.410 --> 00:52:47.190
Kenny Maka his teens and after the parties died down,

839
00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:52.400
he said change [inaudible] swept through his village to do jewel was that we

840
00:52:53.091 --> 00:52:56.890
would assess it. Can you cut out cause it would've sent us was simple.

841
00:52:57.360 --> 00:52:58.920
Immediately following independence,

842
00:52:58.921 --> 00:53:02.790
Tanzania became a socialist state and the new government was out to create a new

843
00:53:02.791 --> 00:53:07.050
world order or land changed hands. They abolished the local clans.

844
00:53:07.370 --> 00:53:08.860
That president president in it.

845
00:53:09.090 --> 00:53:12.540
After the independence and the local religions,

846
00:53:13.050 --> 00:53:15.900
he banned the spinning.

847
00:53:17.100 --> 00:53:19.770
This was the brand new age. This is the new era.

848
00:53:20.250 --> 00:53:23.010
You were supposed to have a modern belief system.

849
00:53:23.450 --> 00:53:26.070
The entire village was being to abandon the way that

850
00:53:26.070 --> 00:53:28.110
<v 0>they had worshiped for thousands of years.</v>

851
00:53:28.410 --> 00:53:33.200
<v 13>Thank you. You can tweet about, show me by taking</v>

852
00:53:34.730 --> 00:53:37.380
[inaudible]. Within weeks the church has mapped out. Yeah,

853
00:53:37.390 --> 00:53:39.040
but suddenly they had business.

854
00:53:39.250 --> 00:53:41.400
Catholic church opened up on one side of the street.

855
00:53:41.420 --> 00:53:46.420
Now Lutheran on the other missions [inaudible] people convincing veted us to

856
00:53:47.711 --> 00:53:51.130
join different teens. They even handed out money.

857
00:53:51.580 --> 00:53:56.560
It was kind of a bidding war for souls. All of it was too new.

858
00:53:56.561 --> 00:53:57.394
Too fast.

859
00:53:58.720 --> 00:54:02.020
Does that we would assassin even remembers this one particular night that would

860
00:54:02.460 --> 00:54:02.680
assassin.

861
00:54:02.680 --> 00:54:07.680
Everyone in his village gathered outside Rafa stared at the Sky Kupuna and

862
00:54:08.950 --> 00:54:09.520
whizzy.

863
00:54:09.520 --> 00:54:14.520
They had been told that was the end of life on earth to me the night everybody

864
00:54:20.471 --> 00:54:25.471
was out the whole night waiting to see whether the album today

865
00:54:27.310 --> 00:54:28.090
[inaudible] couple of hours.

866
00:54:28.090 --> 00:54:33.090
He told me we saw the heavens and the moon [inaudible] slamming into each other.

867
00:54:35.620 --> 00:54:37.940
Can you cut out cause I'm going to test this out with sequel

868
00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:46.770
[inaudible] they saw it was a [inaudible].

869
00:54:48.520 --> 00:54:53.460
That's what they say. Looking back on it

870
00:54:53.670 --> 00:54:57.870
<v 0>and maybe that was the end of the world of that old world. Here's the sky.</v>

871
00:54:58.110 --> 00:55:02.220
The switch doctor's assistant who introduced himself to me actually is an

872
00:55:02.221 --> 00:55:05.310
elected official that's made this jump in his life.

873
00:55:06.050 --> 00:55:09.920
[inaudible] that was a particular period of time when everybody was making this

874
00:55:09.921 --> 00:55:11.270
big jump all of a sudden.

875
00:55:11.271 --> 00:55:15.260
So you think that this laughing epidemic had something to do with it?

876
00:55:15.290 --> 00:55:19.460
Like an avalanche of newness? Yeah, all the explanations I came across.

877
00:55:19.461 --> 00:55:23.120
This is the one that makes the most sense to me. It's plausible to me too,

878
00:55:23.121 --> 00:55:26.540
because you got a loss of religion and arrival of a new religion,

879
00:55:26.570 --> 00:55:28.820
a loss of a political culture, a new leader,

880
00:55:28.850 --> 00:55:33.080
and that's a very large pile up of change all of a sudden. Yeah,

881
00:55:33.140 --> 00:55:35.000
and of course everyone's a little bit scared,

882
00:55:35.001 --> 00:55:38.090
so there's quiet and then someone starts to laugh. You know,

883
00:55:38.091 --> 00:55:42.230
who knows why that first girl went crazy and why she started making crazy

884
00:55:42.231 --> 00:55:45.740
laughing noises, but it was like people saw that and they were like, oh God.

885
00:55:45.741 --> 00:55:48.050
I feel like that too. It sounds like laughter,

886
00:55:48.051 --> 00:55:51.920
but you could think of it as like a collective scream or something. Yeah,

887
