00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.045
Hey, Matt. Whatcha doin'?

00:00:03.045 --> 00:00:06.040
&gt;&gt; Oh, hey. Not much, just a little light reading, I suppose.

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:07.660
&gt;&gt; Did you start the Game of Thrones series?

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.710
&gt;&gt; Well, nothing quite that dense, but I'm reading my genome, actually.

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:13.260
&gt;&gt; Really, what does it say?

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.850
&gt;&gt; Some pretty cool stuff here. Actually, I've got

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:20.330
blue eyes, apparently. my blood type is O positive.

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.900
I seem to be able to digest lactose products

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.950
pretty well. I can't taste bitter flavors. A cup

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:28.420
of coffee late at night doesn't bother

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.250
me, because I metabolize caffeine pretty quickly,

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.640
and somewhere in here, oh, I actually had a, an increased risk for Alzheimer's.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.800
&gt;&gt; It tells you all of that? I want to see it. Actually,

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.380
your genome has a lot more information than just what you see here.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.980
Your genome can reveal a lot about you. But you have to know

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.880
how to understand and read the information for it to make any sense.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.710
&gt;&gt; Well, I can't understand that, because that

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.270
just looks like a bunch of random letters,

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.400
to me.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.920
&gt;&gt; Well, I guess so, in a sense, that's what

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.380
your genome is. A unique sequence of letters that has the

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.060
information to make up who you are. So, you're saying,

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.560
all of the cells in my body, they're just little letters?

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.010
&gt;&gt; Well, I guess so, in a sense. your genome's a

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.650
unique sequence of letters, much like this book in a unique

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.230
sequence of letters. But, in our genome, those letters are actually

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:17.370
symbols. They represent a very famous chemical substance that you can find

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:20.390
inside all your cells, and makes up the foundation of

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.330
your genome. DNA. We just learned in the last lesson

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.430
that DNA holds the secret to who we are. It's

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.080
a very special molecule that has many important functions not least

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.630
of which, is that it comprises the entirety of our

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.360
genome. Here's a concept map for lesson 2 that you can

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.820
also download from the instructor's notes and fill in the

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.500
blanks. Print it up or just keep it handy and see

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.770
if you can fill in those empty blanks as we go through the lesson. At

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.050
the end there will be an opportunity for you to fill in the missing words to

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.000
see a complete version. Remember if you prefer to have a complete lesson map as

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.453
you go through the lesson, you can always skip to the end, download it from the

00:01:56.453 --> 00:01:56.973
[UNKNOWN]

00:01:56.973 --> 00:01:59.170
notes and then you will have it. However, I

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.510
highly encourage you to use this incomplete version now.

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.440
Print it out, fill in the blanks, and then

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.530
at the end, you'll see how much you've learned.
