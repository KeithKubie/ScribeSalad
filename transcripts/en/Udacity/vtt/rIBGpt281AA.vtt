00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.141
We know this equation produces an ellipse. We start at the center at the origin

00:00:05.141 --> 00:00:09.419
0, 0, and then we move two units left and right in the x direction, and then we

00:00:09.419 --> 00:00:15.895
move three units in the y direction, up and down. This gives us four main

00:00:15.895 --> 00:00:20.923
points on our ellipse so that way we can graph it easily. We're going to use

00:00:20.923 --> 00:00:27.029
this knowledge of ellipses to help us graph a hyperbola. A hyperbola is another

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.822
type of conic section and its equation looks more like this. Notice that the

00:00:31.822 --> 00:00:35.726
difference between a hyperbola equation and an ellipse equation is this

00:00:35.726 --> 00:00:40.838
subtraction sign here. For ellipses, we have addition between the x squared

00:00:40.838 --> 00:00:46.010
term and the y squared term. But for hyperbolas, we have subtraction between

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:52.218
the terms. One is positive and one is negative. To graph this hyperbola, we're

00:00:52.218 --> 00:00:57.220
going to start by graphing it as an ellipse. So we'll start with this shape

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:01.116
that we already have. Now, those first four points were helpful for graphing

00:01:01.116 --> 00:01:04.227
the start of our elipse and they're also going to be helpful for graphing our

00:01:04.227 --> 00:01:09.220
hyperbola. We'll draw a dashed rectangle around our ellipse so that way we can

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:15.372
start graphing our hyperbola. Once we have the rectangle, we'll draw dash lines

00:01:15.372 --> 00:01:22.226
across the diagonals. Now, this minus sign is like a knife. It's going to cut

00:01:22.226 --> 00:01:27.660
open our ellipse. And then we're going to pivot these two halves outward. These

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.560
two points will become the vertices of two branches that will face this way and

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.740
this way. So notice, I'm going to take off my ellipse now and graph my

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.195
hyperbola. Notice how the branches of this hyperbola approach the diagonals

00:01:42.195 --> 00:01:47.911
from the rectangle. The same is true for this branch. The ins of the graph

00:01:47.911 --> 00:01:53.712
approach the dash line, and this will always be true for our hyperbola. The ins

00:01:53.712 --> 00:01:58.778
will always stretch towards the diagonals that we created from before. Now one

00:01:58.778 --> 00:02:02.064
other important piece of information is that the x square term comes first

00:02:02.064 --> 00:02:08.616
here. This means that our parabola opens to the left and to the right. And you

00:02:08.616 --> 00:02:13.216
might be wondering, how can I get a parabola to open up and open down? Well it

00:02:13.216 --> 00:02:17.542
turns out we just have the y squared term conversed. For example if I make this

00:02:17.542 --> 00:02:21.324
y squared term positive here and we subtract off x squared divded by 4 here

00:02:21.324 --> 00:02:27.585
we'll have a different type of hyperbola. Since the y squared term comes first

00:02:27.585 --> 00:02:33.231
this hyperbola will open up. And it will open down. I'm going to take this

00:02:33.231 --> 00:02:38.675
hyperbola off for now, and then we'll start over with our basic ellipse. Now, I

00:02:38.675 --> 00:02:42.705
could switch the order of the y squared and the x squared terms, since addition

00:02:42.705 --> 00:02:47.115
is commutative. So, I'm just going to move it this term to the right side of

00:02:47.115 --> 00:02:51.920
the y squared divided by 9. I notice when I make this change, I still have the

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.754
same exact ellipse as from before. We started with our center at the origin and

00:02:56.754 --> 00:02:59.939
we went two units left and right from that center and three units vertically up

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:06.316
and down. This time to get this hyperbola, we'll do one thing different. We'll

00:03:06.316 --> 00:03:11.747
still draw our box around our ellipse and we'll have the diagonals to that box.

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.050
Now we'll use these two points as the vertices for the two hyperbola branches.

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:21.797
They'll face this way. The subtraction sign is going to be the knife that cuts

00:03:21.797 --> 00:03:25.278
our ellipse in half, and then the top and bottom of the ellipse will fold

00:03:25.278 --> 00:03:31.547
outward to create our hyperbola. So taking away our ellipse, we get this as our

00:03:31.547 --> 00:03:36.598
hyperbola. And again notice that we have the y squared term coming first, which

00:03:36.598 --> 00:03:42.708
means the parabola opens up and it opens down. Now that you've seen a couple of

00:03:42.708 --> 00:03:46.725
hyperbolas, try creating some on your own. Try changing the values of the

00:03:46.725 --> 00:03:51.546
denominators and see how the hyperbolas change. Have some fun and then continue

00:03:51.546 --> 00:03:52.950
on with the practice.
