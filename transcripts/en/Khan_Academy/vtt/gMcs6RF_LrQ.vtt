00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.750
 

00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:04.320
Let's keep building our table of
Laplace transforms. And now

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.910
we'll do a fairly hairy problem,
so I'm going to have

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.500
to focus so that I don't make
a careless mistake.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.090
But let's say we want to take
the Laplace transform-- and

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:18.630
this is a useful one.

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.620
Actually, all of them we've
done so far are useful.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:23.740
I'll tell you when we start
doing not-so-useful ones.

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.650
Let's say we want to take the
Laplace transform of the sine

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.700
of some constant times t.

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.200
Well, our definition of the
Laplace transform, that says

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.210
that it's the improper
integral.

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:38.890
And remember, the Laplace
transform is just a

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:39.350
definition.

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.440
It's just a tool that
has turned out to

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.410
be extremely useful.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.000
And we'll do more on that
intuition later on.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.660
But anyway, it's the integral
from 0 to infinity of e to the

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.750
minus st, times-- whatever
we're taking the Laplace

00:00:53.750 --> 00:01:01.560
transform of-- times
sine of at, dt.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:07.380
And now, we have to go back and
find our integration by

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.010
parts neuron.

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.590
And mine always disappears,
so we have to reprove

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:13.530
integration by parts.

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:14.940
I don't recommend you do
this all the time.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.720
If you have to do this on an
exam, you might want to

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:17.970
memorize it before the exam.

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.280
But always remember, integration
by parts is just

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.950
the product rule in reverse.

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:23.290
So I'll just do that
in this corner.

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:24.760
So the product rule tells
us if we have two

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.220
functions, u times v.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.440
And if I were take the
derivative of u times v.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.200
Let's say that they're
functions of t.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.290
These are both functions of t.

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.560
I could have written u
of x times v of x.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.140
Then that equals the derivative
of the first times

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.140
the second function, plus the
first function times the

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:46.600
derivative of the second.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.540
Now, if I were to integrate both
sides, I get uv-- this

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.780
should be review-- is equal to
the integral of u prime v,

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.580
with respect to dt-- but I'm
just doing a little bit of

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.570
shorthand now-- plus the
integral of uv prime.

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.790
I'm just trying to help myself
remember this thing.

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.460
And let's take this and subtract
it from both sides.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:17.240
So we have this integral of u
prime v is going to be equal

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:24.620
to this, uv minus the integral
of uv prime.

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:25.920
And, of course, this
is a function of t.

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.370
There's a dt here
and all of that.

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.770
But I just have to do this in
the corner of my page a lot,

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.780
because I always forget this,
and with the primes and the

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.460
integrals and all that,
I always forget it.

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:38.070
One way, if you did want to
memorize it, you said, OK, the

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.580
integration by parts says if
I take the integral of the

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.530
derivative of one thing and then
just a regular function

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.560
of another, it equals the two
functions times each other,

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.170
minus the integral
of the reverse.

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.520
Right?

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.080
Here, when you take the
subtraction, you're taking the

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.530
one that had a derivative,
now it doesn't.

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.370
And the one that didn't have
a derivative, now it does.

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.610
But anyway, let's apply
that to our problem at

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.730
hand, to this one.

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.060
Well, we could go either
way about it.

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:12.930
Let's make u prime is equal to--
we'll do our definition--

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:19.580
u prime is equal to e to the
minus st, in which case you

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.890
would be the antiderivative of
that, which is equal to minus

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:30.415
1 over s e to the
minus st, right?

00:03:30.415 --> 00:03:33.950
And actually, this is going to
be an integration by parts

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.170
twice problem, so I'm just
actually going to define the

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.950
Laplace transform as y.

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:40.240
That'll come in useful
later on.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.810
And I think I actually did a
very similar example to this

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.620
when we did integration
by parts.

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.660
But anyway, back to the
integration by parts.

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:48.760
So that's u.

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.980
And let me do v in a
different color.

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.960
So when v-- if this
is u prime, right?

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.510
This is u prime,
then this is v.

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.395
So v is equal to sine of at.

00:04:01.395 --> 00:04:04.320
And then what is v prime?

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.930
Well, that's just a cosine
of at, right?

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:09.110
The chain rule.

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:12.120
And now, we're ready to
do our integration.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:17.519
So the Laplace transform, and
I'll just say that's y, y is

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:21.529
equal to-- y is what we're
trying to solve for, the

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:24.070
Laplace transform of sine
of at-- that is

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.210
equal to u prime v.

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:28.880
I defined u prime in v, right?

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:29.650
That's equal to that.

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:31.940
The integral of u
prime times v.

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.260
That equals uv.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:46.700
So that's minus 1 over s e to
the minus st, times v, sine of

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:52.580
at, minus the integral.

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:57.970
And when you do the integration
by parts, this

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.540
could be an indefinite
integral, an improper

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:01.950
integral, a definite
integral, whatever.

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:03.080
But the boundary stays.

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:10.210
And we can still say, from 0
to infinity of uv prime.

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:20.800
So u is minus 1 over s e to the
minus st, times v prime,

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:32.350
times a cosine of at--
fair enough-- dt.

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:33.720
Well, now we have another hairy

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.210
integral we need to solve.

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:37.940
So this might involve another
integration by

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:42.360
parts, and it does.

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:43.890
Let's see if we can simplify
it at [? all. ?]

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:45.340
Let's take the constants
out first. Let me

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:46.890
just rewrite this.

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:54.440
So we get y is equal to minus
e to the minus st

00:05:54.440 --> 00:06:00.090
over s, sine of at.

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:09.700
So you have a minus minus plus a
over s-- a divided by s, and

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:12.250
then these two negative signs
cancel out-- times the

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:19.420
integral from 0 to infinity,
e to the minus st,

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:23.080
cosine of at, dt.

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:25.110
Let's do another integration
by parts.

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:27.250
And I'll do this in a purple
color, just so you know this

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:29.520
is our second integration
by parts.

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.720
Over here.

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:40.670
Let's define once again, u prime
is equal to e the minus

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:43.550
st. So this is u prime.

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:50.150
Then u is equal to minus 1
over s e to the minus st.

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:53.010
We'll make v equal
to cosine of at.

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:55.720
 

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:58.730
The hardest part about this is
not making careless mistakes.

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:02.590
And then v prime-- I just want
it to be on the same row-- is

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:09.560
equal to minus a sine
of at, right?

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:12.160
The chain rule, derivative
of cosine is minus sine.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:17.070
So let's substitute that back
in, and we get-- this is going

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:21.960
to get hairy; actually, it
already is hairy-- y is equal

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:35.620
to minus e to the minus st over
s, sine of at, plus a

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:41.220
over s, times-- OK.

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:42.810
Integration by parts.

00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:43.680
uv.

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:53.540
So that's minus 1 over s e to
the minus st, times v, times

00:07:53.540 --> 00:08:06.910
cosine at, minus the integral
from 0 to infinity.

00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:08.310
This problem is making
me hungry.

00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:10.800
It's taking so much glucose
from my bloodstream.

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:14.000
I'm focusing so much not to
make careless mistakes.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.380
Anyway, integral from
0 to infinity.

00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:26.250
And now, we have uv prime, so
u is minus 1 over s e to the

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:30.460
minus st. That's u.

00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:34.480
And then v prime
times minus a.

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:37.159
So let's make that minus cancel
out with this one.

00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:38.400
So that becomes a plus.

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:46.860
a sine of at, dt.

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:49.170
I'm starting to see the light
at the end of the tunnel.

00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:51.700
So then, let's simplify
this thing.

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:53.610
And, of course, we're going to
have to evaluate this whole

00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:56.730
thing, right?

00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:58.350
Actually, we're going to have
to evaluate everything.

00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:00.440
Let's just focus on the
indefinite integral for now.

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:02.020
We're going to have to take
this whole thing and

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:05.180
evaluate-- let's just say that
y is the antiderivative and

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:07.340
then evaluate it from
infinity to 0.

00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:08.850
From 0 to infinity.

00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:15.125
So y is equal to minus
e to the minus st

00:09:15.125 --> 00:09:19.072
over s, sine of at.

00:09:19.072 --> 00:09:21.690
Now let's distribute this.

00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:32.950
Minus a over s squared, e to
the minus st, cosine of at.

00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:33.430
Right?

00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:35.990
OK, now I want to make sure I
don't make a careless mistake.

00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:36.380
OK.

00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:39.390
Now, let's multiply this times
this and take all of the

00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:40.520
constants out.

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:42.450
So we have an a and an s.

00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:43.790
a over s.

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:44.740
There's a minus sign.

00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:46.470
We have a plus a to the s.

00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:56.740
So we'll have a minus a squared
over s squared, times

00:09:56.740 --> 00:10:00.990
the integral from 0-- well, I
said I'm just worrying about

00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:06.060
the indefinite integral right
now, and we'll evaluate the

00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:07.680
boundaries later.

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:13.760
e to the minus st,
sine of at, dt.

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:15.800
Now, this is the part, and we've
done this before, it's a

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:18.580
little bit of a trick with
integration by parts.

00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:22.500
But this expression, notice,
is the same thing as our

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:23.940
original y.

00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:24.400
Right?

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:25.410
This is our original y.

00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:27.110
And we're assuming we're doing
the indefinite integral, and

00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:28.340
we'll evaluate the
boundaries later.

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:30.440
Although we could have kept the
boundaries the whole time,

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:32.120
but it would have made
it even hairier.

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:34.440
So we can rewrite this
integral as y.

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:37.580
That was our definition.

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:39.440
And actually, I just realized
I'm running out of time, so

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:42.010
I'll continue this hairy problem
in the next video.

00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:43.260
See you soon.

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:43.900
