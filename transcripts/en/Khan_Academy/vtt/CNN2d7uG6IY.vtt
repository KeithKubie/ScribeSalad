00:00:00.525 --> 00:00:03.664
- [Instructor] As we've already
seen, the 5th Century BCE

00:00:03.664 --> 00:00:07.990
starts off with Athens and
Sparta and various Greek

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:10.927
city-states fighting on
the same side against

00:00:10.927 --> 00:00:12.677
the Persian invaders.

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.367
But as we saw in the last
video, as soon as the Persians

00:00:16.367 --> 00:00:20.872
are dealt with, tensions
start to rise between Athens

00:00:20.872 --> 00:00:23.567
and Sparta and their various allies.

00:00:23.567 --> 00:00:27.130
Sparta gets worried that
the Athenian Navy is looking

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.428
maybe a little bit too
strong, they were decisively

00:00:29.428 --> 00:00:32.830
important in the Second Persian Invasion,

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:37.174
and they build this Delian
League, whose purpose

00:00:37.174 --> 00:00:40.145
is to go on the offensive
against the Persians,

00:00:40.145 --> 00:00:42.449
but more and more so it
was starting to look like

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:44.069
an Athenian empire.

00:00:44.069 --> 00:00:46.804
And a lot of this you can
imagine, it's like a game of Risk.

00:00:46.804 --> 00:00:49.958
The more you take over, the
more resources you have,

00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:51.737
the more that you can
build more ships and have

00:00:51.737 --> 00:00:54.789
more soldiers so that you
can take on even more.

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:56.965
So as Sparta and Athens
are starting to become more

00:00:56.965 --> 00:01:01.819
and more rivals, Sparta's
getting insecure about Athens'

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:06.260
influence and their resources,
and their military power.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.101
And we even saw it in
the last video, you have

00:01:08.101 --> 00:01:10.394
an earthquake in Sparta,
potentially right around

00:01:10.394 --> 00:01:12.307
the same time that Sparta
was planning an invasion

00:01:12.307 --> 00:01:15.327
of Athens, leaving the
Spartans vulnerable.

00:01:15.327 --> 00:01:19.051
There's a Helot uprising,
these Spartan slaves.

00:01:19.051 --> 00:01:23.126
The Athenians send Hoplites to
apparently help the Spartans

00:01:23.126 --> 00:01:24.960
but the Spartans are
suspicious of it and they

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.042
send them back.

00:01:26.042 --> 00:01:30.735
And then it culminates
with the skirmish you have

00:01:30.735 --> 00:01:34.590
between Megara and Corinth,
which were historically

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.473
two Spartan allies, but
Athens decides to take sides,

00:01:38.473 --> 00:01:42.049
gets an alliance with Megara,
and that's one thing too many

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:45.071
for the Spartans, and so they declare war,

00:01:45.071 --> 00:01:47.707
and you have what's called
the First Peloponnesian War.

00:01:47.707 --> 00:01:50.090
But that's not the Peloponnesian
War, that's the first

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.151
time that you start
having very open conflict

00:01:52.151 --> 00:01:55.934
between the Spartans and the Athenians.

00:01:55.934 --> 00:01:58.234
And these conflicts last
for, on the order of about

00:01:58.234 --> 00:02:02.094
15 years, and they're
ended with what's called

00:02:02.094 --> 00:02:04.033
the Peace of 30 Years.

00:02:04.033 --> 00:02:06.711
But as we will see, this
Peace of 30 Years only lasts

00:02:06.711 --> 00:02:07.961
about 15 years.

00:02:10.273 --> 00:02:13.425
And the whole time,
tensions continue to arise.

00:02:13.425 --> 00:02:17.718
The Delian League, or you could
call it the Athenian power,

00:02:17.718 --> 00:02:19.158
the Athenian empire I should say,

00:02:19.158 --> 00:02:21.072
is getting more and more powerful.

00:02:21.072 --> 00:02:23.685
The Athenian Navy is getting
more and more powerful.

00:02:23.685 --> 00:02:25.755
And once again, things
culminate, and now this is

00:02:25.755 --> 00:02:28.681
the beginning of the
actual Peloponnesian War,

00:02:28.681 --> 00:02:30.693
the thing that people are
referring to when they talk

00:02:30.693 --> 00:02:32.062
about the Peloponnesian War.

00:02:32.062 --> 00:02:34.812
In 431 BCE, the King of Sparta is

00:02:40.228 --> 00:02:43.895
convinced or is, I guess
you could say he is

00:02:45.944 --> 00:02:50.073
influenced to, even though he
himself was somewhat skeptical

00:02:50.073 --> 00:02:53.580
of the idea, he decides to invade Attica.

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.415
Attica's something
you'll hear a lot about.

00:02:55.415 --> 00:02:57.239
It is this region right
over here, this little

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.272
out-jutting of land, that Athens is on.

00:03:00.272 --> 00:03:02.966
And this first phase of
the Peloponnesian War

00:03:02.966 --> 00:03:07.522
is called the Archidamian War,
named for the King of Sparta

00:03:07.522 --> 00:03:11.689
who somewhat reluctantly
decides to invade Attica.

00:03:13.873 --> 00:03:17.290
And so that's stage one, Archidamian War.

00:03:21.764 --> 00:03:24.990
And the Archidamian War,
its essential ingredients

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:27.291
are you have Sparta with its dominant army

00:03:27.291 --> 00:03:31.124
going and having repeated
attacks onto Attica,

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.523
and the Athenians with their dominant navy

00:03:34.523 --> 00:03:37.776
going and having raids
throughout the Peloponnese

00:03:37.776 --> 00:03:40.015
and along the Aegean Coast.

00:03:40.015 --> 00:03:43.674
So here you have the Athenians,
let me do the Athenians

00:03:43.674 --> 00:03:46.178
and the Spartans in two
different colors, actually.

00:03:46.178 --> 00:03:47.146
So here you go.

00:03:47.146 --> 00:03:49.961
Let's do the Spartans in this red color,

00:03:49.961 --> 00:03:54.230
attacking Attica with their
army, and now let's have

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:57.221
the Athenians with this
light blue color coming here

00:03:57.221 --> 00:04:00.037
and attacking various
points, various points

00:04:00.037 --> 00:04:04.204
on the Peloponnese and in
the Aegean, further extending

00:04:06.062 --> 00:04:08.001
their influence.

00:04:08.001 --> 00:04:11.274
Now that first phase ends, and
it goes on for quite a bit,

00:04:11.274 --> 00:04:13.641
it goes on for about 10 years, ends with

00:04:13.641 --> 00:04:17.258
the Peace of Nicias, but as you will see

00:04:17.258 --> 00:04:21.008
and that was actually intended
to be a 50-year peace,

00:04:21.008 --> 00:04:23.997
but you'll see it
doesn't last long at all.

00:04:23.997 --> 00:04:28.439
The skirmishes continue,
and in 415, the Athenians

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:31.578
say hey, we want to extend our power.

00:04:31.578 --> 00:04:33.255
Remember, it's like this
game of Risk, the more

00:04:33.255 --> 00:04:35.838
city-states you take over,
the more citizens that

00:04:35.838 --> 00:04:38.864
you're able to tax, the
more soldiers you will have,

00:04:38.864 --> 00:04:40.674
the more wealth you will
have, the more shipbuilding

00:04:40.674 --> 00:04:42.323
capability you will have.

00:04:42.323 --> 00:04:45.440
So the Athenians get this
great idea to sail all the way

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.219
to Syracuse and just to be
clear where Syracuse is,

00:04:48.219 --> 00:04:51.529
Syracuse is over here
on the coast of Sicily.

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:54.305
Now this is a long distance
in this ancient world.

00:04:54.305 --> 00:04:56.421
They get this idea to sail
all the way to Syracuse

00:04:56.421 --> 00:04:59.558
to try to take it over,
and essentially to extend

00:04:59.558 --> 00:05:01.218
their empire.

00:05:01.218 --> 00:05:05.385
So this right over here is
in 415, this long voyage

00:05:08.069 --> 00:05:12.082
to take over Syracuse,
and it is disastrous.

00:05:12.082 --> 00:05:15.138
The fleet that tries to go
is able to be destroyed,

00:05:15.138 --> 00:05:18.160
and they get the folks in
Syracuse are able to get

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.803
the assistance of the Spartans,
and so that Greek fleet

00:05:21.803 --> 00:05:22.636
is destroyed.

00:05:22.636 --> 00:05:24.354
And this is often viewed
as the second phase

00:05:24.354 --> 00:05:26.612
of the Peloponnesian War.

00:05:26.612 --> 00:05:29.779
And so this is the Attack at Syracuse.

00:05:30.627 --> 00:05:34.626
Attack at Syracuse, the failed
attempt of the Athenians

00:05:34.626 --> 00:05:37.376
to get Syracuse, to get Syracuse.

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:41.691
And this is a two-year period
of time, because once again,

00:05:41.691 --> 00:05:44.153
this is no joke to send
your navy and to try to get

00:05:44.153 --> 00:05:45.153
at Syracuse.

00:05:46.335 --> 00:05:50.374
And then that takes us
into the third phase,

00:05:50.374 --> 00:05:53.867
the third phase of the Peloponnesian War,

00:05:53.867 --> 00:05:56.406
let me scroll this over a little bit.

00:05:56.406 --> 00:05:59.944
The third phase is often
called the Ionian War.

00:05:59.944 --> 00:06:00.861
Ionian War.

00:06:06.689 --> 00:06:09.547
Ionia is this region
that's now in modern day,

00:06:09.547 --> 00:06:11.949
off the coast of modern-day Turkey.

00:06:11.949 --> 00:06:14.658
You have many of the
city-states that were part of

00:06:14.658 --> 00:06:17.391
this Athenian empire,
they're starting to revolt.

00:06:17.391 --> 00:06:21.230
You can imagine that the
Spartans are trying to help

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:23.505
those revolts because they're
trying to get the Athenians

00:06:23.505 --> 00:06:24.880
wherever they are.

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:28.463
This is often also
called the Decelean War.

00:06:32.315 --> 00:06:36.196
Decelea, I'm probably
not pronouncing it well,

00:06:36.196 --> 00:06:39.135
is a little village right over
here at the top of Attica,

00:06:39.135 --> 00:06:41.380
and it was a strategic
location that went over

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:43.794
to the Spartans and that's
where the Decelean War

00:06:43.794 --> 00:06:44.961
gets its name.

00:06:45.833 --> 00:06:48.928
But over the course of this
third phase, the Spartans

00:06:48.928 --> 00:06:50.931
get help from the Persians.

00:06:50.931 --> 00:06:53.414
Remember this was their enemy,
they had unified the Spartans

00:06:53.414 --> 00:06:55.425
and Athenians had unified
against the Persians,

00:06:55.425 --> 00:06:56.609
but some time has passed.

00:06:56.609 --> 00:07:00.348
We're now 70 or 80 years later,
and the Spartans say hey,

00:07:00.348 --> 00:07:02.217
we want to win this thing decisively.

00:07:02.217 --> 00:07:06.558
They get the help of the
Persians and finally in 405 BCE

00:07:06.558 --> 00:07:10.308
there's decisive naval
battle at Aegospotami,

00:07:13.086 --> 00:07:15.591
and I'm sorry to all of you
Greeks out there that might

00:07:15.591 --> 00:07:17.741
be listening, I know my
pronunciation is not perfect

00:07:17.741 --> 00:07:21.302
or close to perfect, but
this is a decisive victory

00:07:21.302 --> 00:07:23.111
right over here for the Spartans.

00:07:23.111 --> 00:07:27.230
They're able to destroy the Athenian Navy,

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:30.111
and that causes, that's
the decisive victory,

00:07:30.111 --> 00:07:33.223
and then in 404, this is in 405, in 404,

00:07:33.223 --> 00:07:36.758
the Athenians surrender and
the famous Peloponnesian War

00:07:36.758 --> 00:07:39.147
is over, the Spartans are victorious.

00:07:39.147 --> 00:07:41.907
But it's not a great victory
because as you can imagine,

00:07:41.907 --> 00:07:45.282
you have towns that have
been destroyed, large parts

00:07:45.282 --> 00:07:49.449
of Greece have been weakened,
and it leaves the whole area

00:07:51.941 --> 00:07:54.213
open to attack from others.

00:07:54.213 --> 00:07:56.947
And as we will see in the next
century, in the 4th century,

00:07:56.947 --> 00:08:00.657
we have Phillip of Macedon,
or Macedon depending on how

00:08:00.657 --> 00:08:02.841
you want to pronounce it,
who's able to use that

00:08:02.841 --> 00:08:05.660
vulnerable, and the
Macedonians or the Macedonians

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:08.027
they are related to the
Greek people, but he's able

00:08:08.027 --> 00:08:10.914
to use that vulnerability
that happens over the course

00:08:10.914 --> 00:08:14.732
of the 5th century to attack
the city-states of Greece,

00:08:14.732 --> 00:08:17.878
but he actually is able to unify them.
