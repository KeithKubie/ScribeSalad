00:00:01.423 --> 00:00:03.698
- [Voiceover] So now we're
gonna use the initial conditions

00:00:03.698 --> 00:00:07.971
to figure out our values, our
two constant values A1 and A2.

00:00:07.971 --> 00:00:11.601
That is in our proposed
solution for current

00:00:11.601 --> 00:00:13.184
for the LC circuit.

00:00:14.706 --> 00:00:16.271
So one thing we need to do,

00:00:16.271 --> 00:00:18.433
because this is a second order equation.

00:00:18.433 --> 00:00:20.907
We need to have two initial
conditions for the variable

00:00:20.907 --> 00:00:22.685
that we're studying here.

00:00:22.685 --> 00:00:24.049
So we're studying I.

00:00:24.049 --> 00:00:26.545
Right now we have one
initial condition for I,

00:00:26.545 --> 00:00:30.212
and because we have a
second order equation.

00:00:34.537 --> 00:00:37.370
That means we need two ic's for I.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.689
So we have one initial
condition right here,

00:00:43.689 --> 00:00:47.272
and what we'd like to
know is what is di dt

00:00:49.172 --> 00:00:50.755
at time equal zero?

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.902
So the other piece of
information we have is this v.

00:00:54.902 --> 00:00:57.107
V knot at time equal zero.

00:00:57.107 --> 00:01:00.149
So let's use that, and we'll just

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.429
plug that straight into
the inductor equation.

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:05.929
so the inductor equation at t equals zero.

00:01:07.033 --> 00:01:10.899
The voltage across the inductor is v knot,

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:13.399
and that equals L times di dt.

00:01:18.576 --> 00:01:22.743
Alright and that means the
di dt equals v knot over L.

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:30.993
So now I have two initial conditions

00:01:30.993 --> 00:01:32.458
in terms of I.

00:01:32.458 --> 00:01:35.375
There's one, and there's one there.

00:01:36.651 --> 00:01:40.568
And we can use these now
to go after A1 and A2.

00:01:44.742 --> 00:01:48.271
First off let's plug in
I for time equals zero,

00:01:48.271 --> 00:01:51.675
and then see if we can work
our something over here.

00:01:51.675 --> 00:01:54.355
So that means that time equals zero.

00:01:54.355 --> 00:01:58.522
The current is zero and that
equals A1 cosign omega knot

00:02:03.866 --> 00:02:06.199
times, t is zero, times zero

00:02:10.265 --> 00:02:11.765
plus A2 times sine

00:02:16.551 --> 00:02:18.634
of omega knot times zero,

00:02:22.938 --> 00:02:25.263
and what does this evaluate to?

00:02:25.263 --> 00:02:29.430
Okay this is sine of zero
and sine of zero is zero,

00:02:31.424 --> 00:02:33.591
and cosine of zero is one.

00:02:40.241 --> 00:02:43.324
So that comes up with zero equals A1.

00:02:45.577 --> 00:02:49.744
Okay, and A1 equals zero
means that this entire term

00:02:51.254 --> 00:02:54.801
of our solution just dropped out.

00:02:54.801 --> 00:02:57.450
Alright let me write what we end up with.

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.950
I equals A2 sine omega knot t.

00:03:08.203 --> 00:03:11.184
This whole term here just
dropped out of the solution.

00:03:11.184 --> 00:03:13.504
So here's our proposed solution down here.

00:03:13.504 --> 00:03:17.004
Now we need to go after A2, let's do that.

00:03:20.664 --> 00:03:22.433
As you might suspect, we're gonna use

00:03:22.433 --> 00:03:25.877
our second initial condition to do that.

00:03:25.877 --> 00:03:29.095
So to use our initial
condition we need di dt.

00:03:29.095 --> 00:03:30.764
So let's take di dt of this.

00:03:30.764 --> 00:03:34.764
So we're gonna take d dt
of this whole equation,

00:03:37.044 --> 00:03:40.127
and on the left side we'll get di dt,

00:03:42.448 --> 00:03:45.448
and on the other side we'll get d dt

00:03:46.405 --> 00:03:48.405
of A2 sine omega knot t.

00:03:54.195 --> 00:03:55.640
Okay so far so good.

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.723
Let's roll it down again.

00:04:01.032 --> 00:04:02.596
So let's take that derivative.

00:04:02.596 --> 00:04:06.763
We get di dt equals, A2
comes out of the derivative,

00:04:10.513 --> 00:04:14.680
and the derivative of sine
omega knot t with respect to t

00:04:16.652 --> 00:04:19.985
is omega knot times cosine omega knot t,

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:27.997
and we apply our initial condition.

00:04:27.997 --> 00:04:30.573
Let's go to t equals zero,

00:04:30.573 --> 00:04:33.823
and we know the di dt was v knot over L

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:41.076
equals A2 omega knot cosine
of omega knot times zero,

00:04:49.813 --> 00:04:52.396
and cosine of zero goes to one,

00:04:54.749 --> 00:04:56.923
and so we can solve for A2.

00:04:56.923 --> 00:04:58.923
A2 equals V knot over L,

00:05:03.405 --> 00:05:05.905
and omega knot goes down here.

00:05:09.443 --> 00:05:12.711
So now we solve for our
second adjustable parameter

00:05:12.711 --> 00:05:14.375
and we can write I.

00:05:14.375 --> 00:05:16.625
I was A2 sine omega knot t.

00:05:22.344 --> 00:05:24.575
So let's fill it in for A2.

00:05:24.575 --> 00:05:27.825
I equals A2 is v knot over L omega knot

00:05:31.344 --> 00:05:33.344
times sine omega knot t,

00:05:35.433 --> 00:05:37.328
and I wanna go back now.

00:05:37.328 --> 00:05:39.520
I wanna write this a little bit different.

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:44.479
I wanna go back and plug in
our value for omega knot.

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:48.646
So if we remember, we said
omega knot equals one over LC

00:05:52.236 --> 00:05:54.665
and the square root of that whole thing.

00:05:54.665 --> 00:05:56.832
So now L omega knot equals

00:06:00.537 --> 00:06:03.454
square root of one over LC times L,

00:06:07.556 --> 00:06:11.639
and that equals square
root of L squared over LC,

00:06:17.647 --> 00:06:20.980
and that equals square root of L over C.

00:06:24.727 --> 00:06:27.977
Lastly I'll write one over L omega knot

00:06:29.934 --> 00:06:34.101
equals square root of C
over L, just the reciprocal,

00:06:36.501 --> 00:06:38.918
and now we can write I equals

00:06:41.948 --> 00:06:44.948
square root of C over L times V knot

00:06:53.091 --> 00:06:54.841
sine of omega knot t,

00:06:59.271 --> 00:07:03.334
and that is the solution
for the natural response

00:07:03.334 --> 00:07:05.100
of an LC circuit.

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:07.426
It's in the form of a sine wave

00:07:07.426 --> 00:07:10.565
and the frequency is
determined by omega knot.

00:07:10.565 --> 00:07:13.249
Which is the two component values,

00:07:13.249 --> 00:07:15.622
and the amplitude is
determined by the energy

00:07:15.622 --> 00:07:16.803
we started with.

00:07:16.803 --> 00:07:19.073
Which is represented here by V knot,

00:07:19.073 --> 00:07:22.656
and the ratio of the two components again.

00:07:25.453 --> 00:07:27.554
So this is why I said at the beginning

00:07:27.554 --> 00:07:30.804
that this is where sine waves are born.
