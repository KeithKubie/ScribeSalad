00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.635
- [Voiceover] Let's say
I have some curve C,

00:00:02.635 --> 00:00:07.371
and it's described, it
can be parameterized,

00:00:07.371 --> 00:00:12.371
I can't say that word, as,
let's say x is equal to x of t,

00:00:13.417 --> 00:00:17.926
y is equal to some function y of t,

00:00:17.926 --> 00:00:22.757
and let's say that this is
valid for t is between a and b.

00:00:22.757 --> 00:00:25.642
So, t is greater than or equal to a

00:00:25.642 --> 00:00:28.466
and then less than or equal to b.

00:00:28.466 --> 00:00:32.158
So, if I were to just
draw this on, let me see,

00:00:32.158 --> 00:00:33.606
I could draw it like this.

00:00:33.606 --> 00:00:36.361
I'm staying very abstract right now.

00:00:36.361 --> 00:00:38.911
This is not a very specific example.

00:00:38.911 --> 00:00:41.517
This is the x axis, this is the y axis.

00:00:41.517 --> 00:00:46.206
My curve, let's say this
is when t is equal to a

00:00:46.206 --> 00:00:51.012
and then the curve might
do something like this.

00:00:51.012 --> 00:00:53.086
I don't know what it does,
let's say it's over there.

00:00:53.086 --> 00:00:55.633
This is t is equal to b.

00:00:55.633 --> 00:01:00.601
This actual point right
here will be x of b.

00:01:00.601 --> 00:01:01.809
That would be the x coordinate,

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:06.514
you evaluate this
function at b, and y of b.

00:01:06.514 --> 00:01:08.914
And this is, of course,
when t is equal to a.

00:01:08.914 --> 00:01:13.372
The actual coordinate in R2
on the Cartesian coordinates

00:01:13.372 --> 00:01:17.404
will be x of a, which is this right here,

00:01:17.404 --> 00:01:22.130
and then y of a, which
is that right there.

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.810
And we've seen that before,
that's just a standard way

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.992
of describing a parametric
equation or curve

00:01:26.992 --> 00:01:29.675
using two parametric equations.

00:01:29.675 --> 00:01:33.687
What I want to do now is
describe this same exact curve

00:01:33.687 --> 00:01:36.474
using a vector valued function.

00:01:36.474 --> 00:01:39.052
So, if I define a vector valued function,

00:01:39.052 --> 00:01:40.724
and if you don't remember what those are

00:01:40.724 --> 00:01:41.954
we'll have a little bit of review here.

00:01:41.954 --> 00:01:45.261
Let me say I have a
vector valued function r,

00:01:45.261 --> 00:01:48.224
and I'll put a little
vector arrow on top of it.

00:01:48.224 --> 00:01:50.379
In a lot of textbooks,
they'll just bold it

00:01:50.379 --> 00:01:53.053
and they'll leave scalar
valued functions unbolded,

00:01:53.053 --> 00:01:54.655
but it's hard to draw bold

00:01:54.655 --> 00:01:56.777
so I'll put a little vector on top.

00:01:56.777 --> 00:01:59.427
And let's say that r is a function of t.

00:01:59.427 --> 00:02:02.236
And these are going to
be position vectors.

00:02:02.236 --> 00:02:04.037
Position vectors.

00:02:04.037 --> 00:02:07.286
Position vectors.

00:02:07.286 --> 00:02:09.813
And I'm specifying that
because in general,

00:02:09.813 --> 00:02:11.303
when someone talks about a vector,

00:02:11.303 --> 00:02:15.390
this vector and this vector
are considered equivalent

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.665
as long as they have the
same magnitude and direction.

00:02:17.665 --> 00:02:19.616
No one really cares about what their

00:02:19.616 --> 00:02:21.501
start and end points are as long as their

00:02:21.501 --> 00:02:23.781
direction is the same and
their length is the same.

00:02:23.781 --> 00:02:25.304
But, when you talk about position vectors,

00:02:25.304 --> 00:02:27.819
you're saying, "No, these
vectors are all going to

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:30.755
start at zero, at the origin."

00:02:30.755 --> 00:02:32.015
And when you state the position vector

00:02:32.015 --> 00:02:33.361
you're implicitly saying,

00:02:33.361 --> 00:02:36.302
"This is specifying a unique position."

00:02:36.302 --> 00:02:38.052
In this case, it's going to
be in two dimensional space,

00:02:38.052 --> 00:02:39.538
but it could be in
three dimensional space,

00:02:39.538 --> 00:02:42.435
or really four, five,
whatever, n dimensional space.

00:02:42.435 --> 00:02:43.671
So, when you state the position vector,

00:02:43.671 --> 00:02:46.364
you're literally saying,
"Okay, this vector

00:02:46.364 --> 00:02:49.817
literally specifies that point in space."

00:02:49.817 --> 00:02:52.896
So, let's see if we
can describe this curve

00:02:52.896 --> 00:02:57.896
as a vector, a position
vector valued function.

00:02:58.226 --> 00:02:59.235
So, we can say r of t,

00:02:59.235 --> 00:03:01.633
let me switch back to that pink color,

00:03:01.633 --> 00:03:03.192
oh, this keeps staying green,

00:03:03.192 --> 00:03:06.421
is equal to x of t

00:03:06.421 --> 00:03:08.807
times the unit vector in the x direction,

00:03:08.807 --> 00:03:11.133
the unit vector gets
a little caret on top,

00:03:11.133 --> 00:03:12.887
a little hat that's like the arrow for it.

00:03:12.887 --> 00:03:14.639
That just says it's a unit vector.

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:16.324
Plus,

00:03:16.324 --> 00:03:20.204
y of t times j.

00:03:20.204 --> 00:03:22.835
If I was dealing with a
curve in three dimensions,

00:03:22.835 --> 00:03:24.902
I would have, plus z of t times k,

00:03:24.902 --> 00:03:27.316
but we're dealing with
two dimensions right here.

00:03:27.316 --> 00:03:29.610
And so, the way this works is,
you're just taking your ...

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.030
for any t, and still we're gonna have

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.000
t is greater than or equal to a

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.840
and then less than or equal to b.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.994
And this is the exact same thing as that.

00:03:39.994 --> 00:03:41.536
Let me just redraw it.

00:03:41.536 --> 00:03:44.227
So, let me draw our coordinates.

00:03:44.227 --> 00:03:46.286
Our coordinates right here.

00:03:46.286 --> 00:03:48.571
Our axes.

00:03:48.571 --> 00:03:51.621
So, that's the y axis
and this is the x axis.

00:03:51.621 --> 00:03:53.809
So, when you evaluate r of a, right?

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:56.383
That's our starting
point, so let me do that.

00:03:56.383 --> 00:04:00.440
So, r of a, maybe I'll
do it right over here.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.539
Our position vector valued
function evaluated at

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:07.183
t is equal to a, is going to be equal to

00:04:07.183 --> 00:04:12.106
x of a times our unit
vector in the x direction,

00:04:12.106 --> 00:04:16.068
plus y of a times our unit vector in the

00:04:16.068 --> 00:04:18.145
vertical direction, or in the y direction.

00:04:18.145 --> 00:04:19.629
And what's that going to look like?

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:24.342
Well, x of a is this thing right here.

00:04:24.342 --> 00:04:26.595
So, it's x of a times the unit vector.

00:04:26.595 --> 00:04:30.147
So, it's really, maybe the
unit vector is this long,

00:04:30.147 --> 00:04:31.821
it has length one, so
now we're just gonna have

00:04:31.821 --> 00:04:34.187
a length of x of a in that direction,

00:04:34.187 --> 00:04:35.650
and then same thing in y of a.

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.332
It's going to be y of a
length in that direction.

00:04:38.332 --> 00:04:40.152
But the bottom line,
this vector right here,

00:04:40.152 --> 00:04:44.311
if you add these scaled values
of these two unit vectors,

00:04:44.311 --> 00:04:48.742
you're going to get r of a
looking something like this.

00:04:48.742 --> 00:04:52.518
It's going to be a vector that
looks something like that.

00:04:52.518 --> 00:04:53.525
Just like that.

00:04:53.525 --> 00:04:54.968
It's a vector, it's a position vector,

00:04:54.968 --> 00:04:56.803
that's why we're nailing it at the origin

00:04:56.803 --> 00:04:58.939
but drawing it in standard position.

00:04:58.939 --> 00:05:02.465
And that right there, is

00:05:02.465 --> 00:05:04.725
r of a.

00:05:04.725 --> 00:05:07.112
Now, what happens if a
increases a little bit?

00:05:07.112 --> 00:05:09.774
What is r of a plus a little bit?

00:05:09.774 --> 00:05:12.343
And, I don't know, we could
call that r of a plus delta

00:05:12.343 --> 00:05:14.784
or r of a plus h.

00:05:14.784 --> 00:05:15.662
We'll do a different color.

00:05:15.662 --> 00:05:18.977
So, let's say r, let's say
we increase a a little bit,

00:05:18.977 --> 00:05:22.947
r of a plus some small h,
well that's just going to be

00:05:22.947 --> 00:05:27.947
x of a plus h, times the unit vector i,

00:05:27.957 --> 00:05:31.990
plus y times a plus h,
times the unit vector j.

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:33.415
And, what's that going to look like?

00:05:33.415 --> 00:05:35.509
Well, we're gonna go a little
bit further down the curve.

00:05:35.509 --> 00:05:36.613
That's like saying the coordinate

00:05:36.613 --> 00:05:39.108
x of a plus h and y of a plus h.

00:05:39.108 --> 00:05:40.733
It might be that point right there,

00:05:40.733 --> 00:05:44.019
so it'll be a new unit vector.

00:05:44.019 --> 00:05:45.887
It'll be a new unit vector.

00:05:45.887 --> 00:05:48.418
Sorry, it'll be a new
vector, position vector,

00:05:48.418 --> 00:05:50.996
not a unit vector, these won't
necessarily have length one,

00:05:50.996 --> 00:05:53.682
that might be right here.

00:05:53.682 --> 00:05:55.918
Let me do that same color as this.

00:05:55.918 --> 00:05:58.298
So, it might be just like,

00:05:58.298 --> 00:06:00.000
just like that.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000
So, that right here, is r of a plus h.

00:06:05.131 --> 00:06:07.778
So, you see as you keep
increasing your value

00:06:07.778 --> 00:06:11.261
of t until you get to b,
these position vectors

00:06:11.261 --> 00:06:13.856
are going to keep specifying, we're gonna

00:06:13.856 --> 00:06:16.034
keep specifying points along this curve.

00:06:16.034 --> 00:06:19.364
So, the curve, let me draw the
curve in a different color.

00:06:19.364 --> 00:06:21.376
The curve looks something like this.

00:06:21.376 --> 00:06:22.537
It's meant to look exactly like

00:06:22.537 --> 00:06:24.325
the curve that I have up here.

00:06:24.325 --> 00:06:27.504
And, for example, r of b is going to be

00:06:27.504 --> 00:06:29.596
a vector that looks like this.

00:06:29.596 --> 00:06:33.125
It's going to be a vector
that looks like that.

00:06:33.125 --> 00:06:36.366
I want to draw it relatively straight.

00:06:36.366 --> 00:06:39.078
That vector, right there,

00:06:39.078 --> 00:06:42.508
is r of b.

00:06:42.508 --> 00:06:43.852
So, hopefully you realize that, look,

00:06:43.852 --> 00:06:46.174
these position vectors
really are specifying the

00:06:46.174 --> 00:06:49.192
same points on this curve
as this original, I guess

00:06:49.192 --> 00:06:53.233
straight up parameterization
that we did for this curve.

00:06:53.233 --> 00:06:54.835
And I just wanted to do that
as a little bit of review

00:06:54.835 --> 00:06:57.586
cause we're now gonna
break in into the idea of

00:06:57.586 --> 00:07:01.922
actually taking a derivative
of this vector valued function.

00:07:01.922 --> 00:07:04.484
And I'll do that in the next video.
