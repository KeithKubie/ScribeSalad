00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.290
This brings us to the definition
of constraint propagation.

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.110
Constraint propagation
is a method of inference

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:09.650
that assigns values to variables

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.270
characterizing a problem in such a way
that some conditions are satisfied.

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:15.170
So if you have any problem,

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:17.459
that problem is going to be
characterized by some variables.

00:00:18.506 --> 00:00:23.590
And the task is to give specific values
to each variable in such a way that

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.440
some global constraints
have been satisfied.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.092
So given a problem, some problems
are characterized by a set of variables,

00:00:30.092 --> 00:00:32.802
each variable may locally
take on some values.

00:00:32.802 --> 00:00:37.150
So probably the question is, how can
we locally assign values to variables

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.190
in such a way that some global
constraints are satisfied?

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.140
As an example,
let us return to this figure.

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.470
Here is a figure, drawn on a 2D surface,
and the problem is whether or

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:49.870
not it represents a 3D object.

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.930
The variables here are the surfaces and
the orientations.

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.370
One could consider this to be a single,

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.240
two dimensional surface with
some lines drawn on it.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.480
Alternatively, one can think of
this as having four surfaces,

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.750
one, two, three, four, where each
surface has a particular orientation.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.180
The orientation can be specified by
the perpendicular of that surface.

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.800
The method of constraint propagation is
going to help identify the surfaces and

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.100
their orientations.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.450
The constraints here
are defined by these junctions.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.400
For trihedral objects where three
surfaces meet at a particular point,

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.580
these junctions have certain properties.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.640
No matter how we assign
these surfaces and

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.680
their orientations, the assignment
must satisfy all of those constraints.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.490
We'll look at the details of
constraint propagation in a minute.

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.170
But first notice that there are two
possible interpretations to this

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:37.890
particular 3D object.

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.410
One can look at it as if one
were looking inside a box.

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.920
Alternatively, one can look at it as
if one were looking at a building.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.890
This means that constraint
propagation need not

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.120
necessarily always succeed in
this ambiguity between different

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.140
kind of assignments of
surfaces in the orientation.

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.410
Sometimes multiple interpretations
can simultaneously satisfy

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:59.760
all the constraints.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:05.040
It is also possible that no assignment
of values with variables will satisfy

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.940
all the constraints, in which case
interpretation becomes very difficult.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.720
As another example,
let us examine this sentence.

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.240
Colorless green ideas sleep furiously.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.080
All of us can recognize that this
is semantically meaningless, but

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.520
grammatically correct.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.110
How did we know that this
is grammatically correct?

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.560
The variables here are the various
lexical categories, like words and

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.590
nouns and some different predicates.

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:33.153
The values are the assignments we
make to these various words here.

00:02:33.153 --> 00:02:34.673
Is green a noun?

00:02:34.673 --> 00:02:35.869
Is green a verb?

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:37.135
Green a determiner?

00:02:37.135 --> 00:02:39.490
Is it part of a subject or
part of a predicate?

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:44.130
The constraints here are defined with
the rules of English language grammar.

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.310
As we assign values to the various
variables here, that assignment

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.900
must satisfy the constraints of
the English language grammar so

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.460
that as we assign values
to these variables,

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.490
those assignments must satisfy
the constraints of the English language

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:03.000
grammar before we can accept this
sentence to be grammatically correct.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.020
If this sentence was
grammatically not correct,

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:09.840
then we will not be able to assign
values to all the variables in a way

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.930
that will satisfy the constraints
imposed by the English language grammar.

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.560
&gt;&gt; So we've actually come across this
idea of constraints in English language

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.020
grammar before.

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.990
During our lesson on understanding we
talked about how a preposition, for

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:24.090
example, can constrain the meaning
of the word that follows it.

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.990
If we see the word from, for example,

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:29.180
we expect what comes after it to be
some kind of source for the sentence.

00:03:30.258 --> 00:03:33.140
There we used grammatical constraints
in service of some kind of

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:34.560
semantic analysis.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.390
Here we're just using grammatical
constraints to figure out if a sentence

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:39.210
is grammatically correct or not.

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:41.762
There's another connection
here to understanding as well.

00:03:41.762 --> 00:03:44.480
Ashok talked about how we can
interpret this shape as either popping

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.360
out towards us or down into the screen.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.510
We talked about two simultaneously
accurate interpretations of the same

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:55.140
thing and understanding with regard to
sentences that can be read as puns.

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.320
So for example, when I said,
it's hard to explain puns to

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.940
kleptomaniacs because they
always take things literally.

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.750
The word take can simultaneously
be interpreted as interpret and

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.040
physically remove, while satisfying
all the constraints of the sentence.
