00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So the last thing I'm going to talk about this unit is bitcoin

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
which is a way to do digital cash in a completely decentralized way.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
This means that there's no bank--there's no trusted authority--

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
but everyone who participates in the protocol is considered a peer,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and they all have an equal say as to what's valued and what's not.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Bitcoin combines lots of ideas from previous protocols,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
but the particular way that bitcoin does it

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
was proposed by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
The way it avoids needing a centralized bank

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
is to keep track of every single transaction that ever happens.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
So in order to track transactions we have a chain of signatures.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
So here's how that works.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Some coin comes in, and we'll have to talk

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
about how that value gets created, next.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
For Alice to transfer that coin, what she'll do is to create a message

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
that includes the coin, includes that she's transferring it to Bob,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and she'll sign that with her key.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
So then she sends that to Bob.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Bob can verify the signature.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
For Bob to transfer the coin, he'll add transfer to Cathy to that

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
and then sign the whole thing with his private key.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
And now Cathy would do the same thing--

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
take everything that Bob sent, add a transfer message to it,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
and sign the whole thing with her private key.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
And then she can transfer it on to Doug.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
At every link in this chain--

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
as long as they have all the public keys they need--

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
can verify the entire history of transactions.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
So Cathy can verify the signature of Bob--

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
open that up--

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
verify the signature of Alice inside it,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
and verify that the original coin.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
So this is a way to use public key cryptography

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
to keep track of an entire history of transactions.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Does it provide enough to provide digital cash?

00:01:43.000 --> 99:59:59.000
So how many times can Bob spend the coin?
