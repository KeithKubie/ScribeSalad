Hi, my name is Victor Tsaran.

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:06.130
And I work as a technology
program manager at Google.

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:09.970
At Google I work on making sure
that the products we create

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:13.180
are accessible to the audience
of our diverse users,

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:17.140
regardless of their ability or
impairment.

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.750
Modern web technologies make
it very easy for a developer

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.890
to create a website that's difficult for
someone who is blind to use.

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.500
If a user has no vision, it's quite
likely they would be using a screen

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.140
reader, which is a software
that allows them to

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.680
hear the information displayed on the
screen via a text to speech synthesizer.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.650
They may also be using Braille which
allows them to feel the on-screen

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:47.430
text with their fingers
when using braille display.

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.750
Many websites are visual in their
nature and lack keyboard navigation

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.730
which is essential for blind people to
be able to navigate through the content.

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.470
In general, it is safe to assume
that there are more people with

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.900
visual impairments,
that is people who have some sight,

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.770
as opposed to people who
are completely blind.

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.386
There are also people
with low visual acuity.

00:01:11.386 --> 00:01:14.479
And they may be using
large print text or

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:18.887
magnification when using the computer,
for example,

00:01:18.887 --> 00:01:23.388
my friend Laura uses magnification
with text to speech,

00:01:23.388 --> 00:01:26.882
as well as various
color contrast options.

00:01:26.882 --> 00:01:27.968
&gt;&gt; Let's meet up at the coffee shop.

00:01:27.968 --> 00:01:31.124
I can order something for
you, iced coffee okay?

00:01:31.124 --> 00:01:34.740
&gt;&gt; And I haven't mentioned
people with poor color vision

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.629
who may have difficulty distinguishing
red and green or blue and yellow.

00:01:39.629 --> 00:01:43.440
This accounts for
9% of male and 1% of female.

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.580
We may also find ourselves
with temporary challenges,

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.760
such as when trying to use a computer in
the sun or looking at a dodgy projector.

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.920
Whenever accessibility
comes up in a conversation,

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.680
people tend to picture someone
who is blind like myself.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.310
But there actually more impairments
to think about and consider.

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:09.056
There is a huge number of people
with motor or dexterity impairments.

00:02:09.056 --> 00:02:12.969
Such users may be using
only the keyboard, head or

00:02:12.969 --> 00:02:17.640
eye tracking software,
switches, voice dictation etc.

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.330
Someone may have a broken wrist,
broken track pad, or

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.740
simply riding the Shaker train.

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.780
By catering to users with
permanent dexterity impairments,

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.050
we ensure a great experience for
everyone.

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.840
There are also users
with hearing impairments.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:44.210
For example, some may be completely
deaf, yet others have some hearing.

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:49.159
The content that uses sound should
provide some kind of visual alternative.

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:53.729
For example, a messenger app could
be using a flashing alert as well

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:55.504
as sound notifications.

00:02:55.504 --> 00:02:59.928
There are also users with
cognitive impairments, for

00:02:59.928 --> 00:03:03.490
example ADD, dyslexia or autism.

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:05.890
These users may require
diverse accommodations,

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:11.250
such as zooming the screen to make
it easier to read the content,

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:17.440
or minimal design to minimize
destruction and cognitive load.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:23.850
We can all probably relate to
feeling stressful or cognitive load.

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:29.500
So improving the experience for users
with cognitive impairments makes it so

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.360
much better experience for
everybody else.

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:37.545
In summary, accessibility is
really about making sure that

00:03:37.545 --> 00:03:40.905
the content and
the websites we create is

00:03:40.905 --> 00:03:45.355
usable to people with various
impairments or abilities.
