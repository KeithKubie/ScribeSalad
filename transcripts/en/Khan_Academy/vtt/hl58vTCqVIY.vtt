00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.780
 

00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.010
In the last hyperbola video
I didn't get a chance to

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:04.470
do some concrete examples.

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.390
So I'll do that right now.

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:13.050
So, let's say I had the
hyperbola y squared over

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:19.770
4 minus x squared over,
I don't know, let me

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.150
think of a good number.

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:27.310
Let's say, x squared
over 9 is equal to 1.

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.040
So the first thing to figure
out about this hyperbola is,

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.880
what are its asymptotes?

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.970
And, once again, I always
forget the formulas.

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.110
And I just try to solve for y
and see what happens when x

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.510
approaches positive or
negative infinity.

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.680
So if you solve for y,
you can add x squared

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:43.980
over 9 to both sides.

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:50.500
And you get y squared
over 4 is equal to x

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.140
squared over 9 plus 1.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.190
Now, I can multiply
4 times both sides.

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:02.920
And you get y squared is
equal to 4 over 9 times

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.790
x squared plus 4.

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.790
I distribute the 4, take
the positive and negative

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.550
square root both sides.

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:17.270
y is equal to the plus or
minus square root of 4

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.140
over 9x squared plus 4.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:22.880
And you can't really
simplify this anymore.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.000
But we can think about, what
does this approach as x

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.640
approaches positive or
negative infinity.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:36.530
So, as x approaches plus
or minus infinity, what

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.380
does this roughly equal?

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:39.350
What does this approximate?

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.450
What does the graph
get a lot closer to?

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.115
Well, then, y is approximately
equal to just the square

00:01:46.115 --> 00:01:46.810
root of this term.

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.256
Because this becomes super huge
and relative to this term, this

00:01:51.256 --> 00:01:52.690
starts to matter less
and less and less.

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.480
And that's why we get closer
and closer to the asymptotes.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.410
Because when this number
is, like, a trillion, or a

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:02.100
googol, then this number
is almost insignificant.

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.000
You take the square root,
you're pretty much taking the

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.720
square root of this, and
you'll just be a little

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:06.900
bit above the graph.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.260
Because you have this
extra plus-4 there.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.660
So as you approach positive
or negative infinity, this

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.260
equation is approximately equal
to the plus or minus square

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:23.800
root of 4 over 9x squared.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.170
And so, that is -- so y would
be approximately equal

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.950
to the plus or minus.

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.010
We can take the
square root of this.

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.770
Plus or minus the square
root of 4/9 is 2/3, right?

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.880
Square root of 4 over
square root of 9, times x.

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.020
So, these are the asymptotes.

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.160
There's two lines here.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.940
There's y is equal to 2/3 x.

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.860
And then there's y is
equal to minus 2/3 x.

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.660
So let's draw those two lines.

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.080
Let me draw my axes.

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.870
 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.100
Let's make that my y axis.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.470
Make that the x axis.

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.100
Let me switch some colors, just
to make things interesting.

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.620
So let me draw the first one.

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.760
See, y is equal to 2/3 x.

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.240
So, you rise 2 for
every 3 that you run.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:09.970
So let me draw that.

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:17.640
So if this is 1, 2, 3, 1, 2.

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.540
So that would be a
point on the line.

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:21.990
Let me draw the line now.

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:25.380
Actually go to the origin.

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:26.750
No, that's not it.

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.170
Let me draw it like this.

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:29.930
This way I can make sure
it goes to the origin.

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.940
This is going to go
through like that.

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.850
Then I can go from here.

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:35.670
And then go like that.

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.280
So that's one asymptote.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.140
And the other asymptote is
y is going to be equal

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:40.690
to minus 2/3 x, right?

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.450
Because plus or minus 2/3 x.

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:49.110
So, minus 2/3 x, you go down 2
for every 3 that you go out.

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:54.160
So that point will show
up, see if I do, 1, 2.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.320
So you go down 2 for
every 3 that you go out.

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:57.110
So it'll go 3.

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.610
So if I draw that asymptote,
it'll look something

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:03.531
like there.

00:04:03.531 --> 00:04:05.120
Go out there.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.180
And then go from here.

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:09.590
Go out there.

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:10.620
And we've drawn our asymptotes.

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.630
Now the question is, is it
going to open up to the left

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:15.030
or the right, or up and down?

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.430
There's two ways we
can think about it.

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.010
And I'll do it the way that
might be more intuitive for

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:23.910
you is, can x -- what happens
when x is equal to 0?

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:27.520
Well, when x is equal to
0, when x is equal to

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:28.860
0, this disappears.

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.880
And we're just left with,
I'll do it here, y squared

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.480
over 4 is equal to 1.

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.150
Or, y squared is equal to 4.

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.290
Or, y is equal to
plus or minus 2.

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:46.720
So, we know that the point
0, the points, 0 plus or

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.710
minus 2, is on this graph.

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.060
So x can be equal to 0
so 0 plus or minus 2.

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.140
So 0 plus 2 is this
point right here.

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:58.310
And 0 minus 2 is this
point right there.

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.600
So that, by itself, actually,
is enough of a clue to know

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.600
that it opens down here.

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:03.160
And up here.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.800
Because it will never,
a hyperbola will never

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.190
cross the asymptotes.

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:09.610
It's not like it can go out
here and across this asymptote.

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:09.830
So?

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:13.430
We already know that the graph
of this parabola -- and you can

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:15.340
try other points, if you
want, just to verify.

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:16.550
It's going to look
something like this.

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:18.880
It's going to go and then
-- nope, I want to make

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.330
it so it never touches.

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:24.470
It's going to get really
close, but no, I touched it.

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:28.180
It's going to get really
close but never touch.

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:29.970
And then on this side
it's going to get really

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:32.100
close, but never touch.

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:33.310
And I don't want to touch it.

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:35.424
And then on the top side it's
going to do the same thing,

00:05:35.424 --> 00:05:37.243
it's going to get really close,
and as you approach infinity

00:05:37.243 --> 00:05:38.510
it's never going to touch it.

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:40.970
And as you get reall close,
it'll get infiniitely

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:41.850
close but never touch it.

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:44.030
So that's what this parabola
-- this hyperbola --

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:45.100
is going to look like.

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:47.930
And I did it by just trying to
see if x could be equal to 0.

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:50.370
And I encourage you to try
what happens when y equals 0.

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:52.540
And you'll get no solution.

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:55.390
And that makes sense because
this hyperbola never

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:57.180
crosses y equals 0, right?

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:00.330
It never crosses the x axis.

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.630
And this should also be
intuitive, because if we

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:05.250
saw here when we did ths
approximation, as x approaches

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:09.820
positive or negative infinity,
we saw that we always did have

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:12.270
this plus 4 sitting here.

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:17.160
We said, oh, well, as x gets
super large or super negative,

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:18.470
this starts to matter
less and less.

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:22.190
But we will always be slightly
larger than this number.

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:24.810
Especially in the positive
quadrant, right?

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:26.605
We're always going to be --
so the positive quadrant is

00:06:26.605 --> 00:06:29.250
always going to be slightly
larger than the asymptote.

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:33.210
And even when we take the
positive square root, I guess,

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:33.990
is the best way to say it.

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:36.600
When we take the positive
square root, we'll always

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:39.140
be larger than either
of the asymptotes.

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:42.100
And, likewise, when you take
the negative square root,

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:44.010
you're always going to be
a little bit smaller than

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:44.910
either of the asymptotes.

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:46.690
Because this number is
going to be a little bit

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:48.540
bigger than this number.

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:49.740
Then we take the negative
square root, you're going to

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:51.150
be a little bit smaller,
and that's why we're

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:52.280
a little bit below.

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:54.260
I don't know which one's
more intutive for you.

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.590
Maybe just the -- trying it
when x is equal to 0 and when y

00:06:57.590 --> 00:06:59.740
equals 0, and see what points
you get and say, oh, then I'm

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:04.990
in kind of a vertical hyperbola
as opposed to a horizontal one.

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:07.960
So let's see if I have time
for -- I'll leave that

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:08.770
video right there.

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:10.090
And then I'll do another
video where I actually

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:11.990
shift the hyperbola.

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:15.350
And shifting it is actually
no different than shifting

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:16.470
an ellipse a circle.

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:19.200
You just have, you know, y
minus something squared, and x

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:21.370
plus something, or x minus
something squared and that just

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:23.890
tells you where you
shift the origin.

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:26.610
This hyperbola, of course, is
just centered at the origin.

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:28.890
Anyway, see you in
the next video.

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:29.390
