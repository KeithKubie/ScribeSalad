00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:09.500
CRITIC: Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic, I remember it so you don't have to.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.180
Disney Princesses.

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:12.360
[♪♪]

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.140
They represent everything kind, ethical, powerful and beautiful.

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:19.140
And absolute click-bait whenever mentioned online!

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.680
this is MY feeble attempt to cash in on that!

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:24.460
why do we love to talk about them so much?

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.780
they represent what we want to be, but have been criticized often for either being too flawed or too perfect.

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:33.120
maybe that's one of the reasons we like to write conspiracies about them!

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.740
fan-theories and gossip that often get proven to be true or false.

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:43.000
it's humanizing to think there are secrets behind those flawless smiles that might actually make them more complex, or even more simple.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.100
Blogs, forums and fan-sites have gone nuts coming up with their own reasons on why certain things are the way they are.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.940
and, truth-be-told, I've come up with a few as well.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:57.040
This is a combination of them to give you a new point-of-view on the fairy tales you thought you knew so well.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.780
And we're gonna look at the top eleven of them here today!

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.000
Why top eleven?

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.040
Because I like to go one step beyond.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.620
So, sit back and enjoy the Top 11 Disney Princess Conspiracies!

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.120
[♪♪]

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.400
CRITIC: Number Eleven.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.120
CRITIC: We know that the story is set in France, despite only one person having a French accent.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:35.680
But, why would they all be speaking English anyway-- ONE CONSPIRACY AT A TIME!

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.380
But where exactly in France is it?

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.900
The theory is not only could it be around Notre Dame

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:47.280
But maybe it all happened at the exact same time Quasimodo and Frollo were having their...

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.500
umm... adventures.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:57.160
My first thought is that it's false, because Notre Dame seems like such a giant place with tall buildings, and Belle's village seems very quaint and small.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:05.000
but doing research, there does seem to be not only quite a few small towns over the years, but also mountains and landscapes very similar to the ones they explored.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.820
seeing as the Beast was transformed and people seem to have just forgotten or ignored him as their prince,

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.180
maybe this gave a chance for the Church to take over, and Frollo to rule?

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.140
Hell, it's established at the end that the gargoyles aren't part of Quasimodo's imagination

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.020
Maybe they did something to piss off the same enchantress that transformed the Beast!

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.120
But still, there's no hard evidence.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.320
Unless at some point, Belle had her nose so deep in a book that she accidentally walked by the bell tower--

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.220
--HOLY SHIT! there she is!

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.640
I'm not kidding, that's a real scene from "Hunchback of Notre Dame!"

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.160
When Quasimodo is singing the song "Out There," you can clearly see Belle walking by.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.860
Well, we may not have an official word from the creators, but that's a pretty big clue right there.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.940
So, does Belle live in Notre Dame? let's hope so.

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.060
because a battle between Frollo and the Beast would be friggin' awesome!

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.740
[Beast roars]

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:58.920
CRITIC: Number Ten.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.420
Okay, I know Lilo technically isn't a Disney Princess, but...

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.720
I think she dressed up like one in her TV show!

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.060
does that count? I'm saying that counts.

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.220
Not much thought has been given to the meaning of the names these characters have.

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.580
"Stitch" is a weird enough name for an alien, "Nani" is a basic term for beautiful,

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:24.480
and, well. there's a guy named "Bubbles," we're not gonna interpret much from how they're called.

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:25.540
(fucking bubbles!)

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:30.360
But if you look a little closer, you'll find that Lilo is actually a Hawaiian term having two definitions.

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.360
"Generous one," or "Lost."

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.900
"Generous one" is an obvious meaning, It's a Disney movie and she can obviously be very nice.

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:44.140
but "Lost" obviously has a connection to the loss of her parents, and how her family, or what's left of it, is growing further apart.

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.820
Even Stitch goes out into the middle of the night repeating the word over and over.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:51.080
Okay, I guess that kinda connects, but so what?

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.900
well, when Stitch enters their life, things get more hectic, but he also manages to help their connection.

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.680
and what does "Stitch" mean but to patch things up.

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.560
bring two separated pieces closer.

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.220
So, the actual title to "Lilo &amp; Stitch" could just as easily be called...

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.940
...This suddenly gives a deeper relevance to what was seemingly a simple title.

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.860
So we see, maybe there's more in a name than we thought with this movie.

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:21.280
I guess that's interesting, but we still don't know why the Warner Bros. have a sister that's just randomly named Dot--

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.180
OH MY GOD MY LIFE MAKES SENSE!

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.620
CRITIC: Number Nine.

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:39.100
There's an ongoing argument among Disney fans about whether Mulan should be featured in the Disney Princess lineup.

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:44.400
Not because of her character or anything like that, but because she's never, in any way, given that title.

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.920
She wasn't born into royalty, married into royalty... the most she did was hug an emperor.

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.980
Maybe his royalness rubbed off, making her a princess?

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:59.820
Nevertheless, whenever there's a selling of toys, or you need all the princesses lined up, she's always in there.

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.000
so, why would they showcase something that clearly didn't happen?

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:08.060
well, Mulan by many respects does what none of them have ever done.

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:13.600
Saving an entire nation, countless numbers of people, and doing it all in a non-conventional way,

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.940
despite that it could have caused her great dishonor.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.280
because of this, the emperor of China bows to her.

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:22.320
and it's indicated that this NEVER happens.

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.440
He even offers her a position by his side, but she turns it down.

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:30.580
so, from her accomplishments, and a bow from someone as high up as the emperor,

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:34.220
in many respects, Mulan is even greater than a princess.

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:36.600
she's the protector of an entire nation,

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.520
and what is royalty but a protector of one's land and people?

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:44.800
So in the same way Elsa's often in the lineup, even though she's technically a queen,

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.040
or Pocahontas is in the lineup, even though she's technically a chief's daughter,

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:53.680
Mulan isn't PROmoting herself letting people call her a princess, she's DEmoting herself.

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:57.120
because such acts offered her even higher authority.

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:03.280
but, the values Disney likes to market as princess-y are still there, so it makes sense to have her in the lineup.

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:04.980
So is she a princess?

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:06.460
well, to quote Obi Wan:

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:08.720
OBI WAN: From a certain point of view.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:14.020
In fact, she shouldn't just be "Princess," she should be dead-center with a sword in her hand leading the damn army!

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:16.000
But, two away from the left ain't bad.

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:20.780
MUSHU: My little baby is all grown up and-- *sniff* saving China!

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:25.740
CRITIC: Number Eight.

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:33.600
A good chunk of the story "Aladdin" is about the power of appearance.

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:42.040
You see, Princess Jasmine pretends to be a peasant, Inspiring Peasant Aladdin to pretend to be a prince, inspiring... well.. there's nobody else left, right?

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:44.260
Maybe not.

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:48.260
Ever notice the voice of that merchant from the beginning sounded a little familiar?

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.920
No surprise, it's Robin Williams, who also provided the voice of the Genie.

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:54.820
But, wait, why would they have him in a dual role?

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:59.400
I mean, it's funny and all, but it's not like this film is short on Robin Williams' talents.

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:04.320
Well, a theory has been circulating that this is actually the Genie in diguise.

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:09.900
inspired by the charade started by Jasmine to get peoples' attention by pretending to be someone else.

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:14.600
He even kinda looks like him, with a similar beard, high energy and even wearing blue.

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:21.460
However, the end of the third Aladdin movie, the one that went straight to video, shows him again as seemingly just the merchant.

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:26.460
(I guess he waited several years to finish that supposed three-part story.)

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:31.600
So it seemed like there was no connection until the director came out recently and said that

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.880
Yes, this was always the idea.

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:37.900
the Genie was telling the story about Aladdin as the merchant.

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:41.820
It just had to be cut out of the ending because of time and budget restraints.

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:44.780
you notice in the first film, the merchant never does come back.

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:50.880
so we can draw the conclusion that the merchant in Aladdin AND Aladdin III is also Genie.

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:56.120
enjoying his freedom in disguise, as you never do see the two of them onscreen at the same time.

00:07:56.120 --> 00:08:02.720
and it all stemmed from a princess inspiring a peasant inspiring a genie, emphasizing what was said right at the beginning.

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:07.020
MERCHANT: It is not what is outside, but what is inside that counts.

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:12.140
CRITIC: Number Seven.

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:19.100
The Princess have a knack for looking a lot older than they really are.

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:22.680
in fact the technical grandma of the group is Elsa at 21.

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:25.720
Yeah. she's the only one you could buy a drink for at a bar.

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:28.720
or... maybe her buy you one, you know it'd be cold, at least.

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:31.780
most of them look like they're at least in their early twenties.

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:36.680
and while some come close, like Cinderella and Tiana are 19 and Rapunzel and Pocahontas are 18,

00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:38.840
none of them pass the big two-oh.

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:42.560
some of them look about right, Ariel and Mulan certainly seem 16, and

00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:45.880
I guess Belle could *maybe* pass for 17,

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:49.300
but how the hell is Snow White fourteen?

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:53.460
Just look at the live-action reference, does she look anywhere close to that age?

00:08:53.460 --> 00:09:02.160
the thought is Disney wanted to appeal to small girls, thinking they could be a princess, but also didn't want her to seem too old so that they couldn't imagine themselves in the role.

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:09.440
Fourteen seemed like a good in-between so one could still seem girlish, but also, given the time-period, still be able to live with her prince.

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:15.540
It's a strange choice that really doesn't hold up today, and let's be honest, nobody was really buying anyway.

00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:19.220
But that is the official age that's often announced.

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:23.900
whatever, until I see a 14-year-old Snow White working at Disney World, I don't believe it.

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:29.900
Why can't you be closer to Jasmine's age, who's only a year older? are you kidding me, guys?!

00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:36.260
How does that contrast with the princes who... all have no documented ages whatsoever...?

00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:39.180
I guess age really is just a number.

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:41.660
and sometimes not even that!

00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:47.100
CRITIC: Number Six.

00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:58.800
Now, don't get me wrong, everything sung about her is true, she does keep to herself, doesn't gossip, and reads at a time when it wasn't expected of women.

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:03.200
but have you ever noticed no one else in the town wears the color blue?

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:05.240
Like, at all?

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:07.820
look at it, nobody even comes close!

00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:11.680
there apparently isn't even one piece of blue cloth in the entire town!

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:13.140
why on earth is that?

00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:16.860
well, the only other character you eventually see wear blue is the Beast.

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:20.800
and according to the intro, he was a selfish and unkind ruler.

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:25.260
maybe people associated what he wore with something negative.

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:28.580
Like if you saw somebody walking down the street with a Hitler moustache.

00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:31.180
It's not illegal or anything, but it's a touch off-putting.

00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:34.360
but seeing that it was so long ago they forgot they even have a prince,

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:37.060
maybe they forgot why the color blue was unfashionable, too.

00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:41.400
This would explain why Belle wears it, as she clearly doesn't care what people think about her.

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:46.400
making her match-up with the Beast all the more meaningful, seeing as they're both outcasts in their own unique ways.

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:51.040
Again, just a theory, but it does make both her and "the prince of Notre Dame" stand out.

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:54.200
LUMIERE: *sigh* L'Amour...

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:02.880
CRITIC: Number Five.

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:09.840
So, something not very surprising is some of the princesses wear gloves.

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:13.080
No big shock, they're about as common an accessory as tiaras or jewellery.

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:19.780
but there's been an interesting theory floating around, out of all the princesses, only three seem to wear them.

00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:22.000
Tiana, Cinderella and Belle.

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:23.960
Well, okay but, so what?

00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:28.180
All of them have one thing in common, can you guess what it is?

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:31.720
none of them were born into being princesses.

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:34.520
they had to hook up with a prince and marry into it.

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:39.180
and strangely enough none of the other Disney Princesses wear gloves.

00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:42.040
the ones that married into it are the only ones.

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:45.280
could it be there's some sort of connection or message we're not seeing?

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:50.760
is it because they come from more hardworking backgrounds, so they hide their hands because they're worried they might look too roughed up?

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:55.560
maybe Disney is doing a subtle commentary on touching between common folks and higher-ups?

00:11:55.980 --> 00:12:03.360
Or... maybe they have rocket fingers that shoot fire out of their fingernails, and they wanna keep them covered so nobody suspects their plans for world domination!

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:10.020
okay, the probable likelihood is that the time-periods these three were a part of just had gloves as common accessories.

00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:13.680
even Elsa wore them a lot in her film, and she was born into royalty.

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:17.180
but she does take them off, but only when she's queen...

00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:19.200
but only whe-- okay I can't connect everything.

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:21.560
nevertheless, it's an interesting coincidence.

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:25.680
but whether or not they want to admit to their fire-shooting nails is entirely up to them.

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:28.020
But just know, we'll be watching!

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:29.840
BELLE: *sigh*

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:35.120
CRITIC: Number Four.

00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:41.880
This one goes back a loooong ways.

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:43.520
(and yes, I did mean it that way.)

00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:52.400
on both the poster and VHS cover of The Little Mermaid, people swear that one of the towers looks particularly... um... penetrating.

00:12:52.400 --> 00:13:01.740
For years, people have been claiming that the artist not once, but twice snuck in a dong on the marketing for one of the most famous kids' films of all time.

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:06.060
Is it possible somebody thought they could just sneak that in without somebody noticing?

00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:14.700
I guess so, but there's also the theory that the castle is based on a style of architecture that... well... can be rather phallic.

00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:19.320
There is a naivete that some people have when they focus too much on a project.

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:24.700
And it's totally possible maybe the person putting this together just didn't notice.

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:33.820
Was it intentional? who knows, but for the rest of us, we've been laughing our asses off until they finally brought it to DVD and scrapped the cover all together.

00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:37.840
Was it because this image was just too distracting and controversial?

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:40.220
Hard to say. (and yes, I meant that one, too.)

00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:45.260
Disney covers have changed a lot over the years, so we can't know 100%.

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:52.220
Whatever the reason, this lives on as one of those snickering moments you don't wanna look at, but can't possibly turn away from.

00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:54.880
CRITIC: *annoying laugh* Wood.

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:00.240
CRITIC: Number Three.

00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:08.180
Sure, we see Anna gets not one, but two suitor in "Frozen,"

00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:11.120
but notice nobody seems to go for Elsa.

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:13.880
and Elsa doesn't seem to go for anybody either.

00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:19.560
this *might* be from an increasingly popular theory that Elsa could very well be a lesbian.

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:28.020
...I'm not exactly sure why she's the one singled out, after all, Merida not only doesn't get a boyfriend in "Brave" but she turns down every one that's offered to her.

00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:33.560
Maybe "Brave" wasn't popular enough, or interesting enough to garner such a theory, but "Frozen" certainly is!

00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:40.400
this idea is catching on like wildfire, to the point where there's even a hashtag pushing for the sequel to give Elsa a girlfriend.

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:43.500
this could mean Elsa would be the first lesbian princess.

00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:47.800
even though, again, she's technically a queen, but that's not gonna stop them from putting her in the lineup.

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:52.520
it seems to be a healthy trend, with more and more gay characters popping up in children's shows and movies,

00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:55.760
in fact, "Frozen," arguably, already has a gay character.

00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:59.780
with many saying the store owner *might* have been waving to his husband in the sauna.

00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:02.160
a touch debatable, but still possible.

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:06.840
I guess we can't know 'til the sequel comes out if... well... Elsa does too.

00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:13.420
we don't even know if they'll address a love interest in the next one, chances are they can milk this baby's popularity for several sequels.

00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:15.580
They can take as long as they want with this.

00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:20.120
But with tons of fans and even her voice actress, Idina Menzel, saying she's on board for it,

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:23.240
this might be a theory that could possibly hold some frozen water.

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:27.140
[♪♪]

00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:31.820
CRITIC: Number Two.

00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:40.660
How the hell is that possible?! they don't even take place in the same time-period!

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:44.740
Well, knowing the incredibly factual scientific research of Greek gods and merpeople,

00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:48.320
It can be concluded that their lifespans can be debatabley long.

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:51.420
even if that were true, though, how would these two have any connection?

00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:57.620
You see, in Greek mythology, Hercules' father, Zeus, is brother to another god named Poseidon.

00:15:57.620 --> 00:16:00.280
seen here in Disney's very odd rendition.

00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:05.300
Poseidon has many, many sons. and one of them is named, that's right, Triton.

00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:13.120
A different Triton, perhaps? That'd be a pretty big coincidence, considering they both have mystical powers connected to living underwater.

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:16.980
whether it's the original Triton, or a name jst passed down through the family,

00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:18.680
there is definitely a relation.

00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:21.440
and Triton's seventh daughter is, of course, Ariel.

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:29.440
Because of this, that technically means Triton is Hercules' first cousin, and Ariel is Hercules' cousin once removed.

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:34.240
yeah, it's strange to think these two might actually have some blood between them.

00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:41.980
it's made even stranger when you consider the fact that Hercules also seemingly existed at the same time the hyenas killed Scar in The Lion King.

00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:49.220
This could all just be coincidence, but for Disney conspiracy nuts like myself, I like to think maybe people are keeping it more in the family than we think.

00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:50.800
[♪♪]

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:56.920
CRITIC: And the Number One Disney Princess Conspiracy is...

00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:08.040
...Yeah, you're probably sick of seeing this one everywhere, but the fact is, it's still a pretty damn good theory.

00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:12.660
the ship carrying the parents of Anna and Elsa is seen sinking in the beginning of Frozen.

00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:16.640
the first part of the theory indicates that they were heading to Rapunzel's coronation.

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:18.720
which was happening at the end of Tangled.

00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:26.180
why jump to that conclusion? well, on top of Rapunzel attending Elsa's coronation, the timelines actually do match up!

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:29.600
after the death of the parents, Frozen skips three years,

00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:33.860
the exact amount of time between "Frozen" and "Tangled"'s release dates.

00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:35.640
but where does "The Little Mermaid" come in?

00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:40.620
well, "The Little Mermaid" was also a Hans Christian Andersen story, like "The Snow Queen," which "Frozen" is based on

00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:43.220
"The Little Mermaid" is set off the coast of Denmark,

00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:46.560
Which means it's totally possible that the graveyard of ships

00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:49.020
seen in both the opening and ending of the movie

00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:53.420
could very well contain the ship that had Elsa and Anna's parents on it.

00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:58.660
It's unlikely it's the one she's searching through, or the one Eric steers at the very end, as their designs are very different,

00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:04.860
but it's not implausible to think that, in all her treasure hunts, maybe she did come across the very same one.

00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:10.680
again, even though there's no conclusive evidence, it does seem totally possible.

00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:19.580
and when you throw in "Hercules" and "The Lion King" being connected as well, that's FIVE universes you'd swear have nothing in common all suddenly connected.

00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:21.440
"Crazy," you say? maybe.

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:26.960
or, maybe it's the best Disney Princess Conspiracy ever devised.

00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:34.040
Or maybe it's crazy-- BUT MAYBE, it's the BEST DISNEY PRINCESS CONSPIRACY EVER DEVISED!

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.160

that's probably not it.
