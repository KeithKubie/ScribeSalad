00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:17.110
Snakes on a Plane was a ridiculous work of
fantasy with no basis in reality….

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:22.250
But as it turns out, a scenario almost exactly
like that once happened over a hundred years

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.320
ago on a boat.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.300
While some of the details of the event have
been lost to history, what we know for sure

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.730
is that sometime in the closing months of
1889, a ship called the Margaret set sail

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.070
from the city of Durban in current day South
Africa helmed by one Captain Sargent.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.580
The Margaret was headed for Boston with a
rather curious cargo that included at least

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:49.250
100 cockatoos, a dozen or so snakes, two crocodiles,
an orangutan, a gorilla and an unconfirmed

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.270
numbers of monkeys and parrots.

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.280
According to a copy of the Sydney Morning
Herald from April 9, 1890, the animals were

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.040
destined for a museum (though it doesn’t
mention what for or which one).

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.400
Shortly after setting sail a horde of rats
caused chaos by eating through the meager

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.780
grain stores that had been set aside for the
cockatoos and parrots, resulting the deaths

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.600
of all but a few of the birds by the end of
the journey.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.350
The crew’s efforts to save the birds were
put on hold when a freak gale knocked over

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.440
some boxes, freeing all of the snakes.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.070
At the same time, the crocodiles also managed
to escape and entered into a three way battle

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:28.210
royale with the snakes and rats, effectively
making it so the crew didn’t have safe access

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.840
to a large portion of the ship for a reported
five days.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.421
In a bizarre stroke of good fortune, after
all of the snakes and rats were dead, the

00:01:36.421 --> 00:01:40.759
lone surviving crocodile was killed when a
second storm hit and knocked over a box of

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:44.630
cargo, crushing the crocodile and once again
making the hold accessible.

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.299
But this wasn’t the end of it.

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:50.560
You see, all of the monkeys had escaped and
had taken refuge on the only place they felt

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.840
somewhat safe, the ship’s rigging.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.130
Despite the best efforts of the exhausted
crew, they only managed to recapture four

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:02.260
of the monkeys before a combination of storms,
high winds and giant waves swept the remainder

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.380
out to sea, never to be seen again.

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.979
Now at this point, you’re probably thinking,
surely it’s all over, right?

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.220
To which we respond, you forgot about the
gorilla.

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.681
Yes, along with having a dozen snakes, two
crocodiles and a slew of monkeys to deal with

00:02:17.681 --> 00:02:21.430
on a relatively small ship, the crew also
had to figure out how to convince an angry

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.430
gorilla to climb back into the box it had
forced its way out of.

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.330
As if that wasn’t bad enough, the gorilla
also somehow managed to get hold of a sturdy

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:34.230
iron bar, which the Wiltshire Gazette reported,
“With this formidable truncheon [the gorilla]

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.050
threatened to brain every sailor who came
within range.”

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.040
The only positive thing going for the crew
was that the gorilla was still chained to

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.030
the floor, though the chain did give it relatively
liberal range.

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.750
It reportedly put up an impressive amount
of resistance, injuring almost every member

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.000
of the crew as they vainly tried to get it
back in its container.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.660
The worst injury was suffered by the crew’s
cook who was apparently “partially scalped”

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.260
by a crushing blow to the temple he failed
to duck.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.220
The gorilla then grabbed the cook, whose life
was only saved via another crew member taking

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.310
the opportunity of the gorilla being occupied
to sneak up behind it and wack it over the

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.230
head with the blunt end of a hatchet.

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.280
The stunned gorilla was then forced back into
its box.

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.769
You might be wondering at this point what
happened to the orangutan that was stored

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:16.769
on board.

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:20.450
Well, none of the news reports or other accounts
mention that it survived the trip, so presumably

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:25.660
it either died in the same way the monkeys
did or perhaps was eaten by a crocodile.

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.640
In January of 1890, the Margaret limped into
port in Boston, reportedly a great surprise

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.849
to the museum staff who’d simply assumed
that the boat had been destroyed by a storm,

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:36.620
since it was so late to arrive.

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.880
In the end, the staff who’d been waiting
for their large shipment of animal cargo to

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:45.020
arrive found only four cockatoos, a few monkeys,
and a single gorilla left alive.

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:49.040
When the bemused authorities asked Captain
Sargant what had happened, he simply responded

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.910
that between the storms and the animals it
was an experience he’d rather not repeat

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.430
and promptly refused to talk about it.

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:00.570
Thankfully for those of us who like a bit
of odd, obscure history, his crew were significantly

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:06.170
less tightlipped and told the story to anyone
who’d listen, leaving us of the 21st century

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:59.009
with the humorous 19th century newspaper accounts

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:23.650
of

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:25.060
the event.
