MARY GROVE: We have an
audience question.

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:19.380
How does that affect the way
we evaluate potential

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.362
investments, especially
at the seed level?

00:00:21.362 --> 00:00:31.190

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:34.400
LOUIS GRAY: Welcome to Google
Developers Live at I/O 2013.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.382
I'm Louis Gray, head of GDL.

00:00:36.382 --> 00:00:38.850
And joining me today is my
co-host Daniel Sieberg.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.760
DANIEL SIEBERG: Louis, thanks so
much for having me here at

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.960
GDL Live at I/O 2013.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.990
This is actually my second I/O.
And I believe it's your

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.470
forth, right?

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.440
LOUIS GRAY: It's my fourth I/O.
I went twice as press.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.290
And it's my second year
here as Googler.

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.140
I'm really excited about what
we've got in stage for GDL at

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.710
I/O. We have exclusive
interviews kicking off from

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.290
the stage in Moscone really
back-to-back.

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.540
Right between every single
session, so not a single

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.240
minute is wasted for those of
you on the live-stream.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.710
Really excited about that.

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:02.110
DANIEL SIEBERG: Yeah,
absolutely.

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.150
We've got 5500 folks here,
but lots more watching,

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:06.330
wherever you are.

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.870
And part of my job will be to,
not only be here with you

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.160
chatting on occasion, but to
actually go out and talk to

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.720
the developers in the sandboxes,
our partners.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.810
Learn from them about what
they're working on

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:16.750
and bring that here.

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.680
We'll see some of that content
today and then some of it

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:19.610
tomorrow as well.

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:20.350
LOUIS GRAY: Absolutely,
I'm looking forward

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:21.100
that a great deal.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.920
You're going to talk with
partners from Google+, Drive,

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.290
Maps, and YouTube.

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.950
And while you're away doing the
hard work, I'm going to be

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.590
back here, holding
down the fort.

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.940
We're going to be talking with
Megan Smith of Google X to

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:31.820
talk about moonshots.

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.780
We'll be talking to people on
Blink, Performance Alley,

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.190
Ingress, and some really hot
topics that everybody wants to

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.590
know about.

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:38.050
DANIEL SIEBERG: Yeah.

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:39.730
Fantastic keynote, of course,
to a kick all of this off.

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:41.570
We've got a lot of work to do.

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:42.820
We've got an amazing lineup.

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.130
I feel like I should go roll
up my sleeves and get at it

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.540
here, right?

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.150
LOUIS GRAY: Absolutely.

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:47.830
So I definitely appreciate
you joining me.

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.360
For those of you on the live
stream, we definitely want you

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.290
follow Google Developers
on YouTube.

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.420

miss a single moment.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.360
I'll be right back here in a
couple of minutes with Megan

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.840
Smith of Google X to
talk moonshots.
