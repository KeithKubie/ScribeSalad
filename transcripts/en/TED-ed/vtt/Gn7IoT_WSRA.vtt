00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.976
(Music)

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.976
Everything is everywhere these days.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.334
Check out the supermarket -- orange
juice from China, nuts from India,

00:00:18.358 --> 00:00:20.976
swordfish from Japan,
lagers from Czechoslovakia,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.976
scores of European cheeses.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.976
You name it, it's there.
Not when I was growing up.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.976
You'd never taste a range
of French cheeses

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.976
or Bohemian lager beer.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.976
At least, you couldn't
unless you were very rich

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.239
and could go anywhere when the fancy
took you. All that has changed.

00:00:39.263 --> 00:00:41.976
But it's not just foods. Got an iPhone?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.976
Everyone knows it was invented
and designed at Cupertino

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.976
in California, but who knows where

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.096
the complex bits and pieces of its
innards are made or assembled?

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.976
Apple doesn't say.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.976
The industry credits China,
Japan, Germany, South Korea

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.976
and, of course, the United States itself.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.976
Just think for a moment
of the trillions of parts

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.976
and finished goods moving
cheaply around the world

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.976
every second, a small portion by air,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.976
but most by sea.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.976
We call it globalization,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.191
but the man who basically made
globalization a reality in our lives

00:01:18.215 --> 00:01:20.976
is too little known. This is his story.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.976
The story of the man who makes your day.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.976
In the Great Depression of the '30s,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.976
when millions of Americans were
out of work, worse than now,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.976
Malcolm McLean was a 24-year-old
truck driver.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.976
He got a job to take cotton bales

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.976
from Fayetteville in North
Carolina all the way

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.976
to a pier in Hoboken, New
Jersey for shipping overseas.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.976
He was glad of the work,
but when he arrived

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.976
he got bored out of his mind,
sitting in his truck

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.976
waiting and waiting
and waiting on the docks

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.976
as the worker ants muscled crates
and bundles off other trucks

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.976
and into slings that lifted the goods
into the hold of the ship.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.976
On board the ship itself,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.976
with much yelling and arm waving,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.976
the stevedores then unloaded each sling

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.976
and saw its contents placed
in a designated position

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.976
in the hold.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.976
Malcolm wasn't just bored, he was fuming.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.976
His income depended on getting
back to North Carolina

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.976
to pick up more loads in his truck.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.976
Out of the frustration,
inspiration struck.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.976
Wouldn't it be great, he thought,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.976
if my trailer could be lifted

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.976
and placed on the ship

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
without its cotton bales being touched.
Yes, it would be great.

00:02:33.024 --> 00:02:35.976
It would be revolutionary. For centuries,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.976
general non-bulk cargo had been shipped
in the process he watched.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.976
It was called break bulk shipping.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.976
Boxes, bales, crates
handled piece by piece.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.976
What Malcolm envisaged
would have saved him only a day,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.976
but it would have saved everyone else

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.976
something like two weeks
in loading and unloading the ship.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.976
On average, it was eight days

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.976
to haul and distribute break
bulk shipments in the hold,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.976
plus another eight days at the other end

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.976
to retrieve and distribute.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.976
All that time would have been saved

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.048
if Malcolm McLean could have just
driven his truck onto the ship

00:03:12.072 --> 00:03:14.976
and at the other end, driven it off.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.976
Well, today that concept is a reality.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.976
The concept that occurred to Malcolm

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.976
is known as containerization.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.976
It has done more than just
save a great deal of time.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.976
It's the reason why we have
a thriving global marketplace,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.976
offering us that infinite
variety of things,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.976
and it's the reason we can move cargo

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.976
from remote parts
of the world at minimal cost.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.976
Malcolm had his idea in 1937.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.976
The 24-year-old truck driver
sitting in his truck in Hoboken

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.976
was 40 before he did anything about it.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.976
By then, he'd built his one truck

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.976
into a big trucking company.
He borrowed money

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.976
from an enterprising vice president
at Citibank in New York,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.143
and set about designing the steel
boxes and the decks of the ships

00:03:59.167 --> 00:04:01.976
to carry them stacked
one on top of another.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.976
A lot of people thought he was crazy.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.976
Inventors always attract
armies of naysayers

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.191
who can never remember
how critical they were.

00:04:10.215 --> 00:04:12.976
For our part, we should
remember Malcolm McLean.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.976
His first container ship, the Ideal X,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.976
sailed from Shed 154

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.976
at Marsh Street, Port Newark

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.976
with 58 well-filled boxes.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.976
It was the beginning of the container era,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.976
shrinking our world

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000
and enlarging human choice.
