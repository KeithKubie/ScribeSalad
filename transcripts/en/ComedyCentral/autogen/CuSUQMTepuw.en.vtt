Pikachu no it's very good one time I saw
 

00:13:04.269 --> 00:13:10.620
Pikachu no it's very good one time I saw
an Elmo vomit of Elmo's with their heads

00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:10.630
an Elmo vomit of Elmo's with their heads
 

00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:15.199
an Elmo vomit of Elmo's with their heads
off is like the saddest day of my life

00:13:15.199 --> 00:13:15.209
 
 

00:13:15.209 --> 00:13:19.590
 
over the next one every day I'm dead

00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:19.600
over the next one every day I'm dead
 

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:31.330
over the next one every day I'm dead
