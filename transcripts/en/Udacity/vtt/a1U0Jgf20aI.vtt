00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:01.790
So if you use your genetic code for this

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:04.880
question, you shouldn't have had any trouble at all. We

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.710
see that a change from CGC to GGC would

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.080
be a change from arginine to glycine, so that would

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.530
be number three. A change from GGC to AGC

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:18.490
would be a change from glycine to serine, which would

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.410
be number four. Change from CTG to ATG would

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.426
be a change from leucine to methionine, which should be

00:00:25.426 --> 00:00:27.390
number one. And that leaves a change from

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.580
GGG to GCG, number two from glycine to alanine.
