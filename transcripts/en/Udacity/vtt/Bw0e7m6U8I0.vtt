00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.572
I was using my favorite red pen to write with yesterday, but unfortunately it

00:00:03.572 --> 00:00:07.270
had an accident. It exploded all over my piece of paper, and you can see I

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:11.120
ended up with a pretty big mess. I even got it all over my hands. I don't know

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.827
if you can tell but my fingers were pretty red yesterday. Now, the big problem

00:00:14.827 --> 00:00:19.206
however, is that I lost a bunch of the work I had done. I started out with a

00:00:19.206 --> 00:00:22.940
polynomial and then found all of its zeros. But now I can only see three of

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:28.460
them. Think you can make it out here. 1, 2 and i. So I'm trying to figure out

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.369
how much work I need to do to figure out my last zero. Do I need to actually

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.421
recalculate it? To answer this question, please just write yes or no in this

00:00:36.421 --> 00:00:40.358
box. In the event that you write no in this box, and we can find this fourth

00:00:40.358 --> 00:00:43.591
zero without really doing any math at all, write what the fourth zero is in

00:00:43.591 --> 00:00:45.752
this box.
