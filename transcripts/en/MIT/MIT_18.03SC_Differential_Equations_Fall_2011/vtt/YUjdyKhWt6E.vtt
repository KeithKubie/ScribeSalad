00:00:05.445 --> 00:00:06.620
PROFESSOR: Welcome back.

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:08.930
So in this session, we're
going to use the matrix

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:12.310
method to solve this linear
system of differential

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:13.330
equations.

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:19.452
These are x dot equals 6x plus
5y, and y dot equals x plus 2y.

00:00:19.452 --> 00:00:20.910
So why don't you
take a few minutes

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.900
to write down the
system in matrix form

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.342
and go through the matrix
method to solve it.

00:00:26.342 --> 00:00:27.300
And I'll be right back.

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.630
Welcome back.

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:45.870
So let's write down this
system in matrix form.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.770
You would have a vector with
entries x and y prime equals

00:00:50.770 --> 00:01:03.740
a matrix with entries 6, 5; 1,
2 multiplying the column vector

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.390
[x, y].

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.540
So now, we did big
part of the work.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.070
The matrix method
tells us that we

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.880
need to find the
eigenvalues of this matrix

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.290
to be able to basically
diagonalize it and seek

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.210
eigenvectors so that then we
can just read off the solutions

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:21.710
and write the
solution of the system

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.290
as a linear combination of the
eigenvectors that we found.

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.620
So let's look for the
eigenvalues first.

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.570
The eigenvalues
would be computed

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:44.950
by seeking the determinant
of this matrix in this form:

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.310
6 minus lambda, 5;
1, 2 minus lambda.

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.140
We're going to have an equation
on lambda, solve for lambda,

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.890
and the solutions will
be our eigenvalues.

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:01.500
So the determinant would be
6 minus lambda multiplying 2

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:07.700
minus lambda minus 5,
1 dot 5, equals to 0.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.420
So here, the lambda that lambda
gives us a lambda squared.

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.050
We have minus 6*lambda
minus 2*lambda,

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.220
which would be minus 8*lambda.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.530
And then, we would have 2
dot 6, which is 12, minus 5,

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.010
which gives us 7.

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.410
So quadratic equation
in lambda, and you

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.010
can factorize it and find the
solutions, which is lambda_1

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.920
equals to 1,
lambda_2 equals to 7.

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.280
So we're done with
the first part.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.640
These are our eigenvalues.

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:42.580
They're not repeated.

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.000
They're just completely
different and real valued.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.840
So now, we're going to look
at the eigenvectors associated

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:50.800
to each eigenvalue.

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:05.126
So first eigenvector would be
associated with lambda_1 equals

00:03:05.126 --> 00:03:05.625
to 1.

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.860
So we would be
solving this system.

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.570
We would be solving this system
with a new matrix, 6 minus 1.

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:23.720
I'm going to spell out this
one so that-- 2 minus 1.

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.190
So this is just our lambda,
multiplying an unknown vector

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:35.260
with components a_1 and
a_2, equals to zero vector.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.860
And basically here, the
unknowns are a_1 and a_2.

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:48.470
So this is simply 5, 5; 1, and
1, [a1, a2] equals to 0, 0.

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.220
So as you saw before,
here, basically, we

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.680
can read off the
equation as being

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.930
5a_1 plus 5a_2 equals to
0 and another one which

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.080
is a_1 plus a_2 equals to 0.

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.430
They're the same equations.

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:06.030
So really, we just have
a_1 plus a_2 equals to 0.

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:11.120
And so our vector
v_1 could be picked

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.750
to just have component 1,
for example, a_1 equals to 1.

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.899
And its second component
would just be minus 1.

00:04:18.899 --> 00:04:21.320
That would be one
pick for our v_1.

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.820
We could normalize this
vector if you wanted to.

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.940
I'm just going to keep
it like this for now.

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.320
So if we look now for the
second eigenvector corresponding

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:38.360
to the second
eigenvalue of 7, I would

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.470
be looking for the
components of these vectors

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:44.036
by doing a similar solving
for the same thing.

00:04:44.036 --> 00:04:46.410
And I'm going to spell it out
again so that you see where

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:47.795
the terms are coming from.

00:04:47.795 --> 00:04:50.676
It's just 6 minus the
value of my lambda...

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.950
[0, 0].

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:03.460
So here, we have 6
minus 7, which is 1, 5.

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:09.100
And then, we have 1 and 2
minus 7, which is minus 5.

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:14.150
So really, what do we have
is an equation minus 1

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:16.730
plus 5a_2 in both cases.

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:24.960
So we can pick a
value for a_1 or a_2

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:32.190
and write down a vector v_2,
in for example the form of a_1

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:35.570
equals to-- let's
pick a_2 equals to 1.

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:38.630
And we would have a_1
equals to 5, for example.

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:42.290
Again, if you wanted an
orthonormal basis formed

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:46.910
by your v_1, v_2, you would just
normalize these two vectors.

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:54.220
So here, basically, we can
then rewrite the solution

00:05:54.220 --> 00:06:02.480
to the original system as
being linear combinations

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:07.820
of-- so I'm just going to
write it in vector form.

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:12.370
The first vector 1--
I'll keep it in v_1, v_2,

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:14.140
that way you see it.

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:15.910
And then, I'll go
into the component.

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:24.350
We'd have v_1 exponential
of the value of lambda

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:26.210
we found that
corresponds to v_1.

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:28.220
So it would be 1 dot t.

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:35.710
And then, v_2
exponential of the lambda

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:37.130
value that corresponds to v_2.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.820
And then, basically,
we just have

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:45.030
constants of integration here.

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:46.670
And so the solution
to this problem

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:50.020
would be linear
combination of the vectors

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:53.720
by the basis of our
eigenvectors and multiplied

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:56.970
by the exponentials assigned
a value of the eigenvalues

00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:59.770
that we found when we
looked for the eigenvalues

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:01.510
of the matrix of the system.

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:05.820
So here, just know that
like for the 1D problem

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:07.740
that we saw before,
we're building

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:11.060
a solution based on linear
combination of lucky guesses

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:11.940
that we used.

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:18.220
And in the one equation case,
we used a guess of e to lambda*t

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:19.880
in 1D.

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:24.980
Here, in this case, we
had a guess of a vector v

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:27.300
and the form of
lambda*t that we used.

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:29.870
And then, basically, we
just solved for the lambdas,

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:32.760
and solved for the v's, and
did a linear combination

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:34.000
of all the solutions.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.644
Like we did before in the 1D
case, we solved the lambda.

00:07:37.644 --> 00:07:39.060
We had different
values of lambda.

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:41.770
We did a linear combinations
of the exponentials.

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:43.730
So that ends this problem.

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:46.490
And here, the key is just
to go through the method

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:48.420
of diagonalizing your matrix.

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:50.520
Basically, it's finding
the eigenvalues,

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:52.930
and then computing the
eigenvectors associated

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:55.050
with that, and
writing your solutions

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:59.627
in terms of a linear combination
of the solution that you found.
