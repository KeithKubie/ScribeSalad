00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:03.874
IAN: Please welcome
Dr. Gemma Munro.

00:00:03.874 --> 00:00:07.110
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:09.010
GEMMA MUNRO: Thank you.

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:09.780
Hello.

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:10.920
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.270
GEMMA MUNRO: So we have
an hour together today.

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:17.080
And just a few weeks
ago, I was with a group

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.700
of founders in the audience,
listening to a successful VC

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:21.750
talk.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.733
And I won't tell you his name.

00:00:23.733 --> 00:00:27.310
He was 60-ish,
jeans, puffy vest,

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.400
and he turned to us
just before he started,

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.770
and he said with great
sincerity-- not great emotion,

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.890
but great sincerity--
I promise you this

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.885
will be the best 45
minutes of your life.

00:00:38.885 --> 00:00:41.010
And I took the opportunity
to look at the audience,

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.660
and I swear I could see their
thoughts on their faces ,

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.795
which was, uh, it might be
overreaching just a little.

00:00:46.795 --> 00:00:49.270
I've have had some good
45 minutes in my life.

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.780
So I'm not going to overreach
today in my promise,

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.440
but I am going to make
a promise to you, which

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.590
is that I promise
that you will leave

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.210
this session with
some practical tips

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.870
that you can use to
increase your confidence,

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.430
increase your
effectiveness, increase

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.100
your success in the workplace.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.400
And for the people leaders and
the emerging or aspiring people

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.010
leaders, I also
promise I'm going

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:14.770
to share some tips
with you on how

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.210
to create successful and
effective female leaders.

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.980
So before we dive
into the content,

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.310
I want to answer that
question that your brain has,

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.930
which is why am I listening
to this chick from Australia?

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:28.810
I've got a gazillion
things to do on my list.

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.840
I could be just crossing
them off right now.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.190
So a little bit about me.

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.730
Ian has given you
some of the detail,

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.990
but I want to give you my
story in a nutshell very,

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:39.450
very briefly.

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.330
I started Inkling Women five
years ago at a time in my life

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.490
where most people said I was
nuts to start a business.

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.300
So I had two children
under three, two mortgages.

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.380
I had a husband who ran his
own climate change consultancy

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.360
and therefore didn't have
a regular salary coming in.

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.220
And most people
thought I was crazy.

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.140
But it was like I
couldn't not start

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.020
Inkling Women, because I kept
having these conversations.

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.200
I was in a very serious
management consulting career.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.090
I kept having these
conversations with women

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.380
who were starting their career
or midway through their career.

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.060
And they were
saying to me, Gem, I

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.420
see the women at the
top of my organization,

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.970
and, yes, I see success.

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.170
But do I see balance?

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:30.580
Do I see enjoyment?

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.280
Do I see authenticity?

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.200
I don't.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.490
So I don't see a path for
myself to become a leader

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.790
where I'm happy, where
I have a balanced life.

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.310
And I'm going to opt out
of leadership all together.

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.610
At the same time,
unbeknownst to them,

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.130
I was having conversations
with their female leaders.

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.710
And those conversations
went more like, Gem,

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:54.192
yes I'm achieving results, I've
got success, but I'm exhausted.

00:02:54.192 --> 00:02:55.900
And I feel like I have
to push myself out

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.040
of bed every morning.

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.790
And somewhere along the way, I
have lost a sense of who I am

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.380
and why I'm driving myself
this hard-- the purpose behind

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:04.840
what I'm doing.

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.785
And I thought surely,
because my belief

00:03:06.785 --> 00:03:09.160
is that the world is going to
be a much better place when

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.990
50% of the world's most
important decisions

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:13.170
are made by women.

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.790
Surely there needs
to be way where

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.730
women can step into
senior-level roles,

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.510
unlock the benefits
of gender diversity

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.730
for the organization,
which are tremendous,

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.650
and absolutely thrive.

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.084
So five years
later, Inkling Women

00:03:26.084 --> 00:03:27.750
is working with really
large enterprises

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.860
to rapidly lift the percentage
of women at leadership level.

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.850
And I've coached and worked
with over 10,000 women

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:37.017
around the world and
also worked with hundreds

00:03:37.017 --> 00:03:37.850
of leadership teams.

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:42.430
And so today I'm here to
share my tips with you.

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:49.440
I do want to ask us to commit
to two nonnegotiable guidelines

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.540
today, if that's OK with you.

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:57.960
So guideline number one, I ask
that you lean into discomfort.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.600
There might be some tips I
share with you or some things

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.590
you consider today that you
think, oh, I don't know,

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.401
I might just take a
step back on that.

00:04:06.401 --> 00:04:07.400
And you've got a choice.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.890
You can step back from it
or you can lean into it.

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:12.310
I ask that you lean into
it, because would you agree,

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:15.950
it's only through leaning
into discomfort that we grow?

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.135
And we actually like to
grow, but if we look back

00:04:18.135 --> 00:04:20.010
on the biggest periods
of growth in our life,

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.570
it has come through being
incredibly uncomfortable.

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:29.870
I have worked with
enough cynical executives

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.230
to know my hypothesis
is that they have stayed

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:35.730
in their comfort zone for way
too long, because what happens

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:37.400
is when we don't
lean into discomfort,

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.850
there's actually no
such thing as stasis.

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:40.690
There's no such thing
as staying the same.

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:45.280
So we suddenly get a little
big bored, listless, apathetic.

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.140
Then we get cynical,
negative, and then we

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:48.880
become grumpy old bastards.

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.140
And no one likes working
grumpy old bastards.

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:53.310
So I ask that you lean
into discomfort today.

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.960
The other
nonnegotiables guideline

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.735
is what happens in
Vegas stays in Vegas.

00:04:58.735 --> 00:05:00.860
In other words, when we
have conversations together

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.640
as a group, and I mean
more in small groups,

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.474
I want you to keep those
between yourselves.

00:05:06.474 --> 00:05:08.598
It doesn't mean that you
can't go after the session

00:05:08.598 --> 00:05:11.164
and say, hey, I learned this
great tip on dot dot dot,

00:05:11.164 --> 00:05:13.580
but what I don't want is,
you'll never guess what happened

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.060
to Susan from accounting.

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:16.999
We don't want those
kinds of conversations.

00:05:16.999 --> 00:05:18.540
Everyone happy to
commit to those two

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:21.280
nonnegotiable guidelines?

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:21.890
Yes?

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:22.424
So yes?

00:05:22.424 --> 00:05:22.924
OK.

00:05:22.924 --> 00:05:23.424
Excellent.

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:29.660
Who here has heard
of the amygdala?

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:30.970
Yeah.

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:33.110
Anyone heard of
amygdala referred to

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:35.750
as the lizard brain?

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:36.420
Some of you.

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:37.170
Yeah.

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:38.961
So for those of you
that haven't heard much

00:05:38.961 --> 00:05:40.790
about the amygdala
or the lizard brain,

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:44.930
it's a teensy tiny
part of your brain.

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:47.300
And thousands of
years ago, it played

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:50.020
this incredibly
important function,

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:53.290
which was to keep you
safe from predators

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:56.316
and also to constantly be
looking out for lack of food.

00:05:56.316 --> 00:05:58.190
So the message it gave
you thousands of years

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:01.490
ago was stay small, stay
hidden, stay small, stay hidden,

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:03.010
stay small, stay hidden.

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:06.310
Fast forward to where we're at
now, anyone here in this room

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:08.840
at least worried about
not having enough dinner

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.570
on the table tonight?

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:12.070
No?

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:13.770
Any worried about
having too much

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:15.570
dinner on the table tonight?

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:16.440
We're so lucky.

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.250
If you're in this room,
you're lucky enough

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:19.958
to not have to worry
about enough dinner.

00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.762
You're lucky enough,
I assume, you're not

00:06:21.762 --> 00:06:23.220
thinking about
going home and being

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:24.444
eaten by a saber-tooth tiger.

00:06:24.444 --> 00:06:26.110
You're lucky enough
to not have to worry

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:28.360
about attacks from predators.

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:32.180
But the lizard brain
thousands of years

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:37.040
ago evolved to stay busy,
constantly switched on.

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:39.180
And bless it's cotton
socks, it needed

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:41.640
to do that, because if it
switched off for one minute,

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:42.920
you'd get eaten, correct?

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:44.650
Or you'd die of starvation.

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:47.620
Again, fast forward now, because
the lizard brain is constantly

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:50.910
switched on and cannot
think thoughts like, oh,

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:56.360
saber-tooth tiger over
there, it makes stuff up.

00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:02.060
It makes up negative thoughts
to keep you safe and small

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:03.060
and hidden.

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:05.895
So instead of thinking,
oh, saber-tooth tiger,

00:07:05.895 --> 00:07:07.520
it actually doesn't
know the difference

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:09.280
between saber-tooth
tiger and slightly

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:11.410
confronting work situation.

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:13.260
And it will feed you
thoughts like you are

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.900
going to look like an idiot.

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:17.710
You're going to step
up there, and you're

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:19.550
going to make a complete
fool of yourself

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:22.010
and no one listen to your
opinion ever, ever again,

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:23.610
and have you got any chance
of a promotion in this place?

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:24.110
No.

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:25.560
You've totally blown that.

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:26.550
It does that.

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:27.380
Again, bless it.

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:30.960
It's doing its job to keep
you safe and small and hidden.

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:35.235
It's just that approximately
99% of those negative thoughts

00:07:35.235 --> 00:07:36.740
are untrue.

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:39.240
They are complete lies.

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:41.250
A couple of examples for you.

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:43.350
We run a public speaking
program for women,

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:45.120
and this always
sounds really weird

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:46.740
when I tell you what
the exercise is,

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:49.260
but it does make sense in
the sense of the two days--

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:50.790
in the context of the two days.

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:53.890
We ask women to stand
up in front of the group

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:57.291
and tell the group what their
lizard is saying to them.

00:07:57.291 --> 00:07:59.290
So share those negative
thoughts with the group.

00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:00.831
We create a very
safe space before we

00:08:00.831 --> 00:08:02.602
ask them to do this, of course.

00:08:02.602 --> 00:08:06.690
And we had one woman
stand up in Melbourne,

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:11.725
and she said my
lizard's telling me

00:08:11.725 --> 00:08:13.850
I shouldn't have
worn these boots.

00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:15.627
These boots are
ridiculous looking.

00:08:15.627 --> 00:08:17.210
Everyone's judging
me for these boots.

00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:19.970
And I kid you not, 20 women
stood up behind her and said,

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:21.219
we love your boots.

00:08:21.219 --> 00:08:23.385
We've been looking at your
boots since you got here.

00:08:23.385 --> 00:08:25.130
We've been coveting those boots.

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:28.750
Very next to step up
said, OK, my lizard voice

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:33.309
is saying that I have no
presence, and I'm so boring,

00:08:33.309 --> 00:08:36.039
and why would anyone look at me?

00:08:36.039 --> 00:08:39.909
And I kid you not, this woman
had the most natural presence

00:08:39.909 --> 00:08:42.429
I have seen in a
speaker for years.

00:08:42.429 --> 00:08:45.110
Have you ever seen anyone where
you can't stop looking at them,

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:46.818
because it's like
they've got electricity

00:08:46.818 --> 00:08:48.202
sparking off all over them.

00:08:48.202 --> 00:08:49.630
She had that.

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:54.250
And yet her lizard was
telling her otherwise.

00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:58.200
I actually was able to watch my
lizard voice in action a year

00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.200
or two ago.

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:02.580
And I have to say, this story
makes me sound way cooler

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:04.470
than I actually am.

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:06.600
I am a choir nerd from way back.

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:08.550
I was one of those,
this one time

00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:10.305
at band camp kids
at school that got

00:09:10.305 --> 00:09:11.590
teased for being a music nerd.

00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:12.790
That was me.

00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:15.690
But a little while ago, I was
able to sing live on stage

00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:16.717
with the Rolling Stones.

00:09:16.717 --> 00:09:18.550
I was a backing singer
for "You Can't Always

00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:21.510
Get What You Want," which
is a very cool story, right?

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:23.310
Just very clear,
I'm not that cool.

00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:25.410
It just happened
to happen to me.

00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:27.540
But I watched my
lizard voice in action.

00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:29.130
I was walking up the ramp.

00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:34.010
It was this huge stadium, 53,000
people, walking up the ramp,

00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:39.100
and my lizard was saying,
OK, find a piece of grass

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:42.845
and dig it, and then get under
the piece of grass and hide,

00:09:42.845 --> 00:09:45.189
and no one will be
able to find you.

00:09:45.189 --> 00:09:47.230
Managed to get through
that, put my ear piece in,

00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:48.110
went backstage.

00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:51.220
They were singing "Brown
Sugar," and the next thought

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:54.180
that went through my head was,
you are going to walk on stage,

00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:55.680
but before you get
to the spotlight,

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:58.560
you are going to trip
over, and 53,000 people

00:09:58.560 --> 00:09:59.410
will laugh at you.

00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:00.910
And then you'll
manage to get up,

00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:02.670
and you'll stand in
front of the mic,

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:04.020
and you will pee your pants.

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:05.060
This was honestly the thought.

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:07.476
You will pee your pants, and
there will be a puddle of pee

00:10:07.476 --> 00:10:08.840
all around me.

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:13.550
And then you'll keep going,
and you'll sing the first note,

00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:15.080
and it will be a bum note.

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:18.200
And Mick will look at you,
and you'll go like that.

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:20.820
And there will be a big
screen with Mick going,

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:22.064
what did that singer just do?

00:10:22.064 --> 00:10:23.480
And everyone will
forever know you

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:26.430
as the singer who completely
fluffed up the Rolling Stones

00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:27.460
concert.

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:30.070
So this is what our
lizard voice does.

00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:36.160
It feeds us lies to keep us
safe and small and hidden.

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:40.000
And over the years of
coaching multiple people,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.370
I've worked out
that the lizard has

00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:47.050
three main lies it tells you.

00:10:47.050 --> 00:10:49.669
And if you think about all
the negative self talk,

00:10:49.669 --> 00:10:51.960
because most of you will have
this negative self talk--

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:53.220
could I just check in--
and you guys are like,

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:54.690
no, we work for Google.

00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:56.660
We've got no negative self talk.

00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:57.420
No?

00:10:57.420 --> 00:10:59.489
You're understanding
what I'm saying?

00:10:59.489 --> 00:11:01.030
Could I just get
some nods so I know?

00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:01.530
OK.

00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:03.150
Good.

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:05.640
Most people, when you think
about negative self talk,

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:11.180
you'll be able to fit it
into one of three categories.

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:13.590
Category number one.

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:17.120
I'm not good enough,
I'm not smart enough,

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:18.040
I'm not thin enough.

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:19.410
I'm not qualified enough.

00:11:19.410 --> 00:11:21.170
I'm not experienced enough.

00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:22.331
I'm not old enough.

00:11:22.331 --> 00:11:24.580
I'm not young enough, et
cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:28.690
First borns tend to fit
firmly in this category.

00:11:28.690 --> 00:11:30.030
I own this puppy.

00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:31.860
Like I own this category.

00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:35.000
And what happens if
you're in this category is

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.514
you will reach something, you
reach a goal, and you go, OK.

00:11:38.514 --> 00:11:39.180
All right, fine.

00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:40.210
I'm still not enough.

00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:41.170
What's next?

00:11:41.170 --> 00:11:42.334
And then you keep going.

00:11:42.334 --> 00:11:43.250
Still not good enough.

00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:43.590
Right.

00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:44.140
What's next?

00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:47.830
And people in this
category never

00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:49.280
feel that they are good enough.

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:51.390
They've always got
to keep striving.

00:11:51.390 --> 00:11:54.300
So that's category number
one, I'm not good enough.

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:56.830
Category number two.

00:11:56.830 --> 00:11:58.570
I'm not worthy.

00:11:58.570 --> 00:12:01.670
I'm not deserving
of dot dot dot.

00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:03.190
My husband is a
very open person,

00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:05.730
so I have cleared it with
him to tell you this story.

00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:09.510
But I remember-- he fits firmly
in this camp-- I remember when

00:12:09.510 --> 00:12:15.144
we had first got together,
about 16 years ago,

00:12:15.144 --> 00:12:17.310
and you can tell that's a
long time, because there's

00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:19.643
no way we would have time to
do this activity right now.

00:12:19.643 --> 00:12:22.500
But for his birthday, I
set him a treasure hunt.

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:24.750
Two young kids, as if I could
set a treasure hunt now.

00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:27.456
Anyway, so he was
walking through the house

00:12:27.456 --> 00:12:29.080
and getting clues
and opening a present

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:30.890
and getting clues and
opening a present et cetera.

00:12:30.890 --> 00:12:31.935
It went on and on and on.

00:12:31.935 --> 00:12:33.530
We were university students.

00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:36.600
And about halfway
through the treasure

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:39.060
hunt, he visibly melted.

00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:40.890
I said, honey, what's wrong?

00:12:40.890 --> 00:12:44.670
He said, oh, I just don't feel
like I deserve all this love

00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:46.400
and all this attention.

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:50.590
So then my husband, category
two, which is I'm not worthy.

00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:52.140
I'm not deserving of.

00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:56.250
Category number three is I
have nothing of value to offer.

00:12:56.250 --> 00:12:58.730
So for instance, a
thought might occur

00:12:58.730 --> 00:13:01.330
like why would these
Googlers listen

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:02.890
to this chick from Australia?

00:13:02.890 --> 00:13:05.850
That could be a thought that
occurs in category three.

00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:07.570
Why would they listen to me?

00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:09.970
There are so many more people
who have so much more value

00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:11.410
to offer.

00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:14.420
So I'm going to ask you to
lean into discomfort now.

00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:17.990
I want you to turn to
the person next to you

00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:20.590
and have a confession session.

00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:25.610
I want you to share which
of those three camps

00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:28.070
you fall into.

00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:32.330
Or if you are across all
three, and that's fine, too.

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:32.830
OK?

00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:34.110
So convention session.

00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:36.084
Just half a minute starts now.

00:13:36.084 --> 00:13:37.625
Those of you watching
on live stream,

00:13:37.625 --> 00:13:39.974
you might want to jot this down.

00:13:39.974 --> 00:13:42.896
[SIDE CONVERSATIONS]

00:14:32.059 --> 00:14:34.899
OK.

00:14:34.899 --> 00:14:35.440
Thanks folks.

00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:42.785
Thank you very much.

00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:48.080
Can I just ask, what was it
like to have that conversation

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:49.227
with a colleague?

00:14:49.227 --> 00:14:50.060
AUDIENCE: Very nice.

00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:51.220
GEMMA MUNRO: Very nice?

00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:55.120
Some of you are literally
going, ah, I feel relieved.

00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:56.785
Like, oh my gosh,
it's not just me?

00:14:56.785 --> 00:14:57.410
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:14:57.410 --> 00:14:58.660
GEMMA MUNRO: And I
really admire you,

00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:00.890
and yet you have these
thoughts about yourself too.

00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:03.180
That's why I ask you to
do this, because everyone

00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:04.250
in the same boat.

00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:07.950
And, in fact, I have coached
some global CEOs, some people

00:15:07.950 --> 00:15:10.000
who have appeared on
the cover of magazines,

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.700
and you would never think they
would think these thoughts.

00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:15.510
And yet, in coaching
sessions, I swear to you

00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:18.430
the most common thing I hear--
they'll sit down, pull up

00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:22.550
a chair, look around and
say, what if they work out

00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:24.980
that I am a total fraud?

00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:26.910
I have no idea what I'm doing.

00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:28.740
I got here on pure luck.

00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:30.430
One day they're
going to work it out,

00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:32.630
and I'm going to be out of
here in a couple minutes.

00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:34.410
Anyone have those
similar thoughts?

00:15:34.410 --> 00:15:35.240
Yes, good.

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:35.920
Own it.

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:38.210
Excellent.

00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:41.690
So what does this have to
do with women in leadership?

00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:46.310
I actually get this question
a lot, which is do men just

00:15:46.310 --> 00:15:48.560
not had a lizard brain?

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:51.060
And the answer is, of course,
men have of lizard brain.

00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:52.850
And so these thoughts
occur whether you're

00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:54.750
a man, whether you're a woman.

00:15:54.750 --> 00:15:58.420
But there are a couple
of little differences

00:15:58.420 --> 00:16:00.790
in the male amygdala
versus the female amygdala.

00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:02.860
And I want to be
super clear here.

00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:05.800
I am not into
biological determinism.

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:09.070
I think gender determinism
went out with happy pants

00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:10.570
in the 1990s.

00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:12.890
It's not about saying, OK,
your brain works this way,

00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:14.540
therefore this is how you act.

00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:17.220
It's just saying that there are
a couple of interesting things

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:19.280
about the way the
amygdala responds

00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:21.350
to threat that
are worth thinking

00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:22.660
about when it comes to gender.

00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:25.220
Is everyone OK with
that distinction?

00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:26.040
OK, great.

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:31.600
So the female amygdala does
tend to respond differently

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:33.970
to threat in a couple of ways.

00:16:33.970 --> 00:16:36.280
I should say perceived threat.

00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:41.070
Firstly, it takes longer
to move past that perceived

00:16:41.070 --> 00:16:44.530
threat in terms of the
emotional effect it has on us.

00:16:44.530 --> 00:16:47.880
So a man, generally speaking--
I have to generalize here--

00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:50.730
a man, generally speaking,
may get up on stage

00:16:50.730 --> 00:16:55.011
and have a terrible
speaking gig and just go,

00:16:55.011 --> 00:16:56.260
that's all right, that's fine.

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:58.020
I'll do it better next time.

00:16:58.020 --> 00:16:59.860
Whereas I've seen
so many women get up

00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:01.890
and speak in front
of a group and not

00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:02.974
show their full potential.

00:17:02.974 --> 00:17:04.806
And they almost make
the decision that's it.

00:17:04.806 --> 00:17:06.060
I'm not doing that ever again.

00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:08.744
Because the emotional impact
of it has been so hard,

00:17:08.744 --> 00:17:10.910
and it's harder to move past.

00:17:10.910 --> 00:17:13.040
The other thing that's
really worth noting

00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:18.280
is that women have a
higher emotional awareness

00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:23.380
of others' responses to them
during a perceived threat.

00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:25.705
So basically, we
care more about what

00:17:25.705 --> 00:17:28.079
other think of us when we're
putting ourselves out there.

00:17:28.079 --> 00:17:29.454
Does that make
sense to everyone?

00:17:29.454 --> 00:17:32.520
We have more awareness of what
others are thinking of us.

00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:37.920
And this, to me, explains
why the well-known study,

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:41.715
I'm sure you know it, men
will see a job description,

00:17:41.715 --> 00:17:43.840
and they'll say, oh, I've
got 6 out of 10 criteria,

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:46.630
I've got this-- again,
I'm generalizing--

00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:48.220
and women will say, no, no, no.

00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:51.580
I need the 9 or 10 out
of 10 to actually apply.

00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:53.990
Some people put that down to
a lack of confidence or lack

00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:54.640
of readiness.

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:55.840
It's not that.

00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:58.575
In my opinion, it's
simply a thought

00:17:58.575 --> 00:18:01.770
of what will others think
of me if I go for this role,

00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:04.500
and I've only got 6 out
of 10 of the criteria?

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:08.980
Will others think I've got too
big for my boots, for instance?

00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:13.440
So we need to be aware
of this, and that's

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:15.504
what this has to do with
women and leadership.

00:18:15.504 --> 00:18:16.920
And I'll talk more
about that when

00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:19.740
I get to tips for
leaders in terms

00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:24.320
of creating successful
and effective females.

00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:26.947
So I have three tips for your.

00:18:26.947 --> 00:18:28.530
First one relates
to the lizard voice.

00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:32.000
These tips are around building
confidence, success, energy

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.520
in the workforce.

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:35.620
Tip number one.

00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:38.130
Quiet the lizard.

00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:40.340
We need to quiet that lizard.

00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:43.320
Feel free to take notes
if this is useful.

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:44.720
And we can do this in two ways.

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:47.850
I'm going to share two very
practical techniques with you

00:18:47.850 --> 00:18:49.210
today.

00:18:49.210 --> 00:18:53.420
Technique number one is called
the defusion technique--

00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:56.160
not diffusion, defusion.

00:18:56.160 --> 00:19:00.240
What happens is most of us
fuse with our lizard voice.

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:03.360
We think our lizard voice
is this font of wisdom,

00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:04.550
and we listen to it.

00:19:04.550 --> 00:19:07.850
What we need to do is learn
to actually defuse from it.

00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:10.070
So a technique for you.

00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:14.300
I would like you to think of one
of the negative thoughts that

00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:16.990
occurs to you most
often, whether it's

00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:20.480
I'm not smart enough, I'm not
deserving of a relationship,

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:22.560
I'm not thin enough,
my thighs are too fat,

00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:24.430
whatever it happens to be.

00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:27.515
And I want you now to just
marinate in that thought.

00:19:27.515 --> 00:19:32.580
So think about that thought
over and over and over again.

00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:33.080
OK?

00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:33.580
Go.

00:19:43.210 --> 00:19:46.484
Sufficiently sad now?

00:19:46.484 --> 00:19:47.650
Let's break you out of that.

00:19:47.650 --> 00:19:50.870
So now we're going to
slightly shift that thought.

00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:55.540
Instead of thinking I'm not good
enough or I'm not smart enough,

00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:57.480
I want you to add
just a little bit

00:19:57.480 --> 00:19:59.090
of a sentence in front of that.

00:19:59.090 --> 00:20:00.960
So instead of thinking
I'm not good enough,

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:05.370
I want you to think my mind is
having the thought that I'm not

00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:06.011
good enough.

00:20:06.011 --> 00:20:07.010
So can everyone do that?

00:20:07.010 --> 00:20:09.320
My mind is having the
thought that and then

00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:10.620
your lizard thought.

00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:11.120
Off you go.

00:20:15.854 --> 00:20:16.770
Notice any difference?

00:20:20.254 --> 00:20:21.170
What's the difference?

00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:25.237
AUDIENCE: Way less emotional.

00:20:25.237 --> 00:20:27.070
GEMMA MUNRO: Way less
emotional, absolutely.

00:20:27.070 --> 00:20:29.210
Do you feel a bit more
distant from the thought

00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:31.040
so you're not fused with it?

00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:32.900
So that's one
defusion technique,

00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:34.940
which is in my mind is
having the thought that--

00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:39.760
Second technique requires you
to lean into discomfort again,

00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:43.170
because I'm going to ask you
to be a little bit silly.

00:20:43.170 --> 00:20:46.440
Second technique involves
using a silly voice.

00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:50.410
My colleagues, Sophie, does
this way better than I do.

00:20:50.410 --> 00:20:53.620
She tries to impersonate
Arnold Schwarzenegger.

00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:56.980
So she will say to
herself, oh, Sophie, you're

00:20:56.980 --> 00:20:59.560
not smart enough.

00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:02.676
So what I'm going get
you to do is stand up.

00:21:02.676 --> 00:21:05.470
Exercise those quadriceps.

00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:06.620
Excellent.

00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:10.900
And this only works
if you commit to it,

00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:13.442
and I know right now your lizard
voice is going, oh my god.

00:21:13.442 --> 00:21:14.775
I'm going to look like an idiot.

00:21:14.775 --> 00:21:16.205
I can't believe I'm doing this.

00:21:16.205 --> 00:21:16.930
That's just your lizard voice.

00:21:16.930 --> 00:21:18.300
It doesn't know what
it's talking about.

00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:19.560
Everyone's feeling the same.

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:24.230
So on the count of three, we are
going to go I'm not dah dah dah

00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:26.825
or I'm not deserving of
whatever your lizard voice is.

00:21:26.825 --> 00:21:29.450
We're going to do it loud and in
Arnold Schwarzenegger's voice.

00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:30.900
OK, ready?

00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:33.110
One, two, three.

00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:36.740
ALL: I'm not good enough.

00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:37.430
Not bad.

00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:39.776
Sit down.

00:21:39.776 --> 00:21:40.900
And that's the other thing.

00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:43.300
Laughing at your
lizard, writing it down

00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:46.260
and seeing what it says
tends to make you go actually

00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:47.460
why would I think that?

00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:49.790
So that's another way of
defusing from the lizard.

00:21:49.790 --> 00:21:52.690
That's tip number one
today-- quiet the lizard

00:21:52.690 --> 00:21:55.010
using defusion techniques.

00:21:55.010 --> 00:21:56.210
Tip number two.

00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:04.460
Do something scary
every single day.

00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:06.800
Every single day
lean into discomfort

00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:08.240
and do something scary.

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:13.560
I have this great belief that
confidence is like a furnace.

00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:16.240
Once you get a fire going, it's
easy to keep it going, correct?

00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:18.520
You just keep adding
fuel onto the fire.

00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:20.480
And it's the same
with confidence.

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:22.690
You keep doing something
scary every day,

00:22:22.690 --> 00:22:24.850
and you're exercising
that confidence muscle.

00:22:24.850 --> 00:22:27.910
But there is a caveat here.

00:22:27.910 --> 00:22:32.710
It has to be the
right kind of scary.

00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:34.780
What's the right kind?

00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:38.680
I've got an analogy that comes
from Martha Beck that I love.

00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:41.780
So I want you to
imagine that you

00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:45.070
are stepping up onto a
ladder and walking out

00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:47.230
onto a diving platform.

00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:49.930
And you are looking
down down down down,

00:22:49.930 --> 00:22:55.827
and you're about to dive
into a pool of toxic sludge.

00:22:55.827 --> 00:22:57.160
What's the feeling in your body?

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:01.460
What's that?

00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:01.670
Sorry?

00:23:01.670 --> 00:23:02.620
AUDIENCE: Don't do it.

00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:03.661
GEMMA MUNRO: Don't do it.

00:23:03.661 --> 00:23:04.550
Yeah, absolutely.

00:23:04.550 --> 00:23:07.970
Do any of you get a yuck,
like a physical revulsion?

00:23:07.970 --> 00:23:09.381
Yuck, get me away from that.

00:23:09.381 --> 00:23:09.880
OK.

00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:11.640
That's the wrong kind of scary.

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:14.420
Any kind of scary that makes
you feel yuck, you run.

00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:17.190
You run from whatever that is.

00:23:17.190 --> 00:23:18.020
Same analogy.

00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:21.150
So this time, working up up up
up up onto the diving platform,

00:23:21.150 --> 00:23:22.230
about to dive down.

00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:24.570
This time you're
looking into a pool

00:23:24.570 --> 00:23:28.350
of sparkling clean
clear blue water.

00:23:28.350 --> 00:23:29.620
How does your body feel now?

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:33.700
Sorry.

00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:34.766
What's that?

00:23:34.766 --> 00:23:35.640
AUDIENCE: Challenged.

00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:36.640
GEMMA MUNRO: Challenged.

00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:39.000
Any other words?

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.080
Do you get that sort of
sense of exhilaration?

00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:45.721
So fear, yes, but like a,
ooh, I've never done this.

00:23:45.721 --> 00:23:47.470
I will one day to know
what it feels like,

00:23:47.470 --> 00:23:49.830
but I can imagine it's
like standing naked

00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:51.270
in a stiff breeze.

00:23:51.270 --> 00:23:52.640
Ooh.

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:56.150
Anything that makes you
feel that kind of scared,

00:23:56.150 --> 00:23:58.070
that's the scare you go for.

00:23:58.070 --> 00:24:01.250
You live your life
following that kind of fear,

00:24:01.250 --> 00:24:02.704
and you will
achieve huge things.

00:24:02.704 --> 00:24:04.370
You'll build huge
amounts of confidence.

00:24:04.370 --> 00:24:07.311
You'll be hugely successful,
hugely effective.

00:24:07.311 --> 00:24:07.810
All right?

00:24:07.810 --> 00:24:13.940
So tip number two, do something
scary every single day.

00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:20.830
Tip number three is to
samba with your fear.

00:24:20.830 --> 00:24:23.740
So I'm sure many of you
have seen Amy Cuddy's talk

00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:24.640
on Power Poses.

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:27.400
Hands up if you've seen Amy
Cuddy's talk, Power Poses.

00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:28.010
OK.

00:24:28.010 --> 00:24:30.320
Again, I'll briefly explain
for those that haven't.

00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:33.060
Cuddy did some
fabulous research where

00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:35.870
she had two control
groups, both going

00:24:35.870 --> 00:24:38.070
into performance situations
like an interview,

00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:40.240
like a speaking gig, et cetera.

00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:43.890
And one group, she just let them
prepare in their normal way.

00:24:43.890 --> 00:24:45.630
The second group,
she asked them to do

00:24:45.630 --> 00:24:47.460
Power Poses for two minutes.

00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:49.625
What does she mean
by Power Pose?

00:24:49.625 --> 00:24:51.360
This is a Power Pose.

00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:52.790
This is a Power Pose.

00:24:52.790 --> 00:24:54.060
This is a Power Pose.

00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:56.230
Making your body big.

00:24:56.230 --> 00:24:58.870
And just by doing
that, these people

00:24:58.870 --> 00:25:01.230
who did these Power
Poses for two minutes

00:25:01.230 --> 00:25:03.537
performed significantly
better in their eyes

00:25:03.537 --> 00:25:04.620
and in the eyes of others.

00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:05.578
They got the interview.

00:25:05.578 --> 00:25:07.090
They nailed the speaking gig.

00:25:07.090 --> 00:25:09.780
And that happened because they
had all these fabulous hormones

00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:11.672
pumping through their
body like decrease

00:25:11.672 --> 00:25:13.380
in cortisol, which is
the stress hormone,

00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:15.695
and increase in testosterone,
which funnily enough,

00:25:15.695 --> 00:25:17.150
is the confidence hormone.

00:25:17.150 --> 00:25:19.420
And serotonin, which
is a happy hormone.

00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:22.920
So by doing this, you actually
pump these fabulous hormones

00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:24.920
into your body.

00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:27.090
While I talk about the
next bit, can everyone just

00:25:27.090 --> 00:25:30.600
adopt some kind of
Power Pose, all right?

00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:34.459
It's interesting, because
so many women I know,

00:25:34.459 --> 00:25:36.750
I ask them, oh, I'm just
going to give you a challenge.

00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:37.833
Just do this in a meeting.

00:25:37.833 --> 00:25:40.230
They say, oh Gem, I
could never do that.

00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:44.740
I would look like
an arrogant mm-mm.

00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:47.670
And funny enough, you only look
like an arrogant mm-mm when

00:25:47.670 --> 00:25:50.540
you're doing this--
in fact, you don't.

00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:53.294
The people that do this
tend to be arrogant mm-mms.

00:25:53.294 --> 00:25:54.960
But what happens is
that women have been

00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:57.270
taught to be small, correct?

00:25:57.270 --> 00:26:00.710
So to stay small, to cross
our legs, to do this.

00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:03.580
That gets in the way
of great performance.

00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:06.530
So that's part of this tip,
which is to samba with the fear

00:26:06.530 --> 00:26:09.020
to make sure that before you
have a performance situation,

00:26:09.020 --> 00:26:10.680
you're doing this in some way.

00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:15.000
But I want you to link
it to another tip, which

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.971
is to pick a song.

00:26:17.971 --> 00:26:20.470
Just for a minute, I want you
to think about going and doing

00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:22.044
something incredibly scary.

00:26:22.044 --> 00:26:23.710
I don't know what
that would be for you,

00:26:23.710 --> 00:26:27.510
but speaking in front of
a huge group of people,

00:26:27.510 --> 00:26:29.470
consulting with an executive.

00:26:29.470 --> 00:26:32.580
I'm not sure what would
strike up that fear for you.

00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:35.050
But tell me, when
you're scared, what's

00:26:35.050 --> 00:26:38.030
going on for you in your body?

00:26:38.030 --> 00:26:40.940
What are the
physical sensations?

00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:42.422
AUDIENCE: You're shaking.

00:26:42.422 --> 00:26:43.130
GEMMA MUNRO: Yes.

00:26:43.130 --> 00:26:45.110
So hands are clammy,
you're shaking.

00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:46.200
Cold.

00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:46.950
AUDIENCE: Thirsty.

00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:47.824
GEMMA MUNRO: Thirsty.

00:26:47.824 --> 00:26:48.560
Absolutely.

00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:48.946
AUDIENCE: Heart
pumps really fast.

00:26:48.946 --> 00:26:49.720
AUDIENCE: You have to pee.

00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:50.761
GEMMA MUNRO: Heart pumps.

00:26:50.761 --> 00:26:51.710
You have to pee.

00:26:51.710 --> 00:26:53.021
Yes.

00:26:53.021 --> 00:26:54.770
Anyone get the butterflies
in the stomach?

00:26:54.770 --> 00:26:56.030
Yeah.

00:26:56.030 --> 00:26:57.290
OK.

00:26:57.290 --> 00:27:01.920
Now think about, is
there another emotion

00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:04.940
where I feel those
same physical symptoms?

00:27:09.220 --> 00:27:11.110
Excitement.

00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:13.240
Yeah.

00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:17.100
For me, I used to get those
same physical symptoms back

00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:19.750
in my early 20s when it
was a Saturday night,

00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:21.300
and I was getting
ready to go out.

00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:26.260
And I was thinking I might meet
the man of my dreams tonight.

00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:28.720
And so it's always like a
flirty kind of sensation,

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:30.990
if that makes sense,
and if I may reveal that

00:27:30.990 --> 00:27:33.030
to this wonderful audience.

00:27:33.030 --> 00:27:36.580
Once you've got that replacement
feeling, so a feeling that

00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:40.270
is a positive feeling that you
feel those physical symptoms

00:27:40.270 --> 00:27:44.985
for, I then want you
to pick a song that you

00:27:44.985 --> 00:27:48.315
link to that new feeling.

00:27:48.315 --> 00:27:50.190
So a song that
when you put it on,

00:27:50.190 --> 00:27:53.710
you immediately feel
excited, flirty, whatever

00:27:53.710 --> 00:27:56.160
that feeling is for you.

00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:57.910
So for me, there's
this fabulous a capella

00:27:57.910 --> 00:27:59.719
group called The Idea of North.

00:27:59.719 --> 00:28:01.510
And they do this version
of "Mas Que Nada,"

00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:04.230
and it's like (SINGING)
mas que nada, da da da da.

00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:07.830
And that brings up this feeling
of flirtiness straight away.

00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:13.620
What I'm promising
you is that if you

00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:19.550
play that song every time before
a situation that scares you,

00:28:19.550 --> 00:28:22.250
so for instance, if you have
fear of public speaking,

00:28:22.250 --> 00:28:23.922
you go and play that song.

00:28:23.922 --> 00:28:25.130
And you're doing Power Poses.

00:28:25.130 --> 00:28:28.060
This is where the toilet
cubicle is your best friend.

00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:31.590
So music on, Power
Poses for two minutes.

00:28:31.590 --> 00:28:36.420
You will learn over time to
associate that scary activity

00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:39.610
with the new, more
positive feeling.

00:28:39.610 --> 00:28:42.415
If you do it often
enough, it will absolutely

00:28:42.415 --> 00:28:43.790
happen, to the
point where when I

00:28:43.790 --> 00:28:47.440
go to speak in front of groups,
now I do feel a little flirty.

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:48.670
So it does happen.

00:28:48.670 --> 00:28:51.750
So that's my third tip.

00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:52.980
Samba with a fear.

00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:55.960
Toilet cubicle, Power
Poses, and music that

00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:58.120
generates that new feeling.

00:28:58.120 --> 00:28:58.787
Yes.

00:28:58.787 --> 00:29:00.995
AUDIENCE: My first question,
how long before the talk

00:29:00.995 --> 00:29:04.200
do you have to do it, because--

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:05.240
GEMMA MUNRO: That is a--

00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:07.030
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] crazy.

00:29:07.030 --> 00:29:08.110
GEMMA MUNRO: Absolutely.

00:29:08.110 --> 00:29:11.590
If you're in a board meeting,
and you're in two hours

00:29:11.590 --> 00:29:15.479
kind of doing this might
be seen as a little-- yes.

00:29:15.479 --> 00:29:18.020
If you're in a situation where
you can't do that in public, I

00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:21.955
would go-- I said to Ian, I'm
just going to the bathroom.

00:29:21.955 --> 00:29:23.330
I was doing this
in the cubicles.

00:29:23.330 --> 00:29:25.890
No one would know.

00:29:25.890 --> 00:29:31.930
So do that as close to
whatever the scary situation is

00:29:31.930 --> 00:29:32.750
as you can.

00:29:32.750 --> 00:29:35.180
But the key thing
then is when you're

00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:39.420
in a situation where you can't
do this, sit in a Power Pose.

00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:42.670
So don't sit like this, sit
like this, sit like that.

00:29:42.670 --> 00:29:45.790
Put your arm over a chair,
anything that you can do.

00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:47.720
And if the
conversation's boring,

00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:51.050
play the song in your head and
just do a little mini dance

00:29:51.050 --> 00:29:52.361
internally.

00:29:52.361 --> 00:29:54.340
Great question.

00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:54.870
All right.

00:29:54.870 --> 00:29:56.370
I actually will
pause for questions

00:29:56.370 --> 00:29:59.870
now before I move
onto tips for leaders.

00:29:59.870 --> 00:30:04.640
So let's just go through those
tips again to become confident,

00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:06.520
successful, increase
our effectiveness.

00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:09.102
Remember tip number one?

00:30:09.102 --> 00:30:10.420
AUDIENCE: Quiet the lizard.

00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:11.190
GEMMA MUNRO: Defuse the lizard.

00:30:11.190 --> 00:30:11.898
Quiet the lizard.

00:30:11.898 --> 00:30:12.570
Excellent.

00:30:12.570 --> 00:30:13.792
Tip number two?

00:30:13.792 --> 00:30:15.030
AUDIENCE: Do something scary.

00:30:15.030 --> 00:30:16.110
GEMMA MUNRO: Do
something scary every day

00:30:16.110 --> 00:30:17.196
but it has to be the--

00:30:17.196 --> 00:30:18.070
AUDIENCE: Right kind.

00:30:18.070 --> 00:30:19.380
GEMMA MUNRO: --right
kind of scary.

00:30:19.380 --> 00:30:20.000
Good.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:21.744
And tip number three?

00:30:21.744 --> 00:30:22.660
AUDIENCE: Power Poses.

00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:23.450
GEMMA MUNRO: Yes.

00:30:23.450 --> 00:30:26.170
Samba with the fear
while doing Power Poses.

00:30:26.170 --> 00:30:26.870
Excellent.

00:30:26.870 --> 00:30:28.920
Any questions on
those three tips

00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:31.370
before I move into
talking about leaders?

00:30:37.534 --> 00:30:40.131
AUDIENCE: Can you give
examples of the things you

00:30:40.131 --> 00:30:43.345
do every day [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:43.345 --> 00:30:44.970
GEMMA MUNRO: So the
question was, can I

00:30:44.970 --> 00:30:48.200
give you an example of the
things I do every day that

00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:49.360
help me feel confident?

00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:49.860
Is that it?

00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:50.980
AUDIENCE: Scary things.

00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:53.900
GEMMA MUNRO: Oh, the scary
things I do every day.

00:30:53.900 --> 00:30:59.330
Talking at Google is my
scary thing for the day.

00:30:59.330 --> 00:31:05.880
So even now, promoting my
business, making sales calls,

00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:07.784
it's not something--
I'm an introvert.

00:31:07.784 --> 00:31:09.450
It's not something
that comes naturally.

00:31:09.450 --> 00:31:12.160
So I push myself to do that.

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:15.410
Applying for awards.

00:31:15.410 --> 00:31:18.040
Inkling just got--
or a few months ago--

00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:21.100
got selected by
KPMG to form part

00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:24.330
of a group of 10 outstanding
starting businesses

00:31:24.330 --> 00:31:26.390
to help get launched
into the US.

00:31:26.390 --> 00:31:29.290
And putting together that
application was really scary.

00:31:29.290 --> 00:31:32.760
So for me, everything scary
that I like to focus on

00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:34.950
is about moving me to
the next level in terms

00:31:34.950 --> 00:31:37.890
of how much service
I can be to others.

00:31:37.890 --> 00:31:40.500
So yes, that's a good
question, thank you.

00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:42.096
And I have to say
what feels scary

00:31:42.096 --> 00:31:43.512
and the right kind
of scary to you

00:31:43.512 --> 00:31:45.470
will be completely
different to what might feel

00:31:45.470 --> 00:31:47.080
the right kind of scary to me.

00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:49.150
And to me, if you
follow that, that's

00:31:49.150 --> 00:31:51.630
like the path of how you're
going to look back on your life

00:31:51.630 --> 00:31:53.460
and say, oh, my goodness.

00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:54.630
I loved that.

00:31:54.630 --> 00:31:57.550
That's not just look what
I achieved, but I loved it,

00:31:57.550 --> 00:32:00.072
and I'm so proud of myself.

00:32:00.072 --> 00:32:01.780
Any other questions
before-- and there'll

00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:04.113
be time for questions at the
end if you're kind of still

00:32:04.113 --> 00:32:06.720
thinking and processing.

00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:07.510
No?

00:32:07.510 --> 00:32:09.840
OK.

00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:14.390
Let's move on to
some tips for leaders

00:32:14.390 --> 00:32:17.550
to make sure that
you're encouraging women

00:32:17.550 --> 00:32:18.990
to thrive in your team.

00:32:18.990 --> 00:32:22.780
So if you are a people leader,
this will be hopefully useful.

00:32:22.780 --> 00:32:25.510
It's also for aspiring
people leaders out there.

00:32:25.510 --> 00:32:28.590
Tip number one
actually goes back

00:32:28.590 --> 00:32:31.800
to being aware of the lizard.

00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:39.060
So don't dismiss a woman
not putting her hand up

00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:41.345
for promotion, speaking
opportunities, stretch

00:32:41.345 --> 00:32:41.845
opportunity.

00:32:41.845 --> 00:32:44.600
Don't dismiss that as
lack of confidence or lack

00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:46.650
of readiness.

00:32:46.650 --> 00:32:51.446
Instead, make sure you are
tapping women on the shoulder

00:32:51.446 --> 00:32:52.570
and saying what about that?

00:32:52.570 --> 00:32:54.690
I think you would
be great for that.

00:32:54.690 --> 00:32:58.030
But my caveat here is you
have to be tapping them

00:32:58.030 --> 00:33:01.830
on the shoulder to move
in a direction that

00:33:01.830 --> 00:33:05.330
is exciting to them, that
aligns with their values

00:33:05.330 --> 00:33:07.000
and their aspirations.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.700
I've worked with
so many women who

00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:11.430
do get the tap on the
shoulder, which is great,

00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:13.755
but there is this
sense of, oh OK, great.

00:33:13.755 --> 00:33:15.920
I'll go there and
I'll go there, perhaps

00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:18.152
because there's more of
this heightened emotion

00:33:18.152 --> 00:33:19.610
awareness of how
this respond to us

00:33:19.610 --> 00:33:22.832
that can be a bit of
people-pleasing situation.

00:33:22.832 --> 00:33:24.040
And, again, I'm generalizing.

00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:25.457
But I've coached
so many women who

00:33:25.457 --> 00:33:27.623
have tapped on the shoulder,
tapped on the shoulder,

00:33:27.623 --> 00:33:29.650
tapped on the shoulder
and going, OK, yeah.

00:33:29.650 --> 00:33:29.733
Great.

00:33:29.733 --> 00:33:29.900
Thank you.

00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:30.400
I'll do that.

00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:30.941
I'll do that.

00:33:30.941 --> 00:33:31.490
I'll do that.

00:33:31.490 --> 00:33:34.730
And they have reached
the top of their ladder,

00:33:34.730 --> 00:33:39.810
and they look back and go,
oh, I'm on the wrong ladder.

00:33:39.810 --> 00:33:41.160
I don't love what I do.

00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:43.760
I've climbed this summit.

00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:45.420
I really want to
be on that ladder,

00:33:45.420 --> 00:33:50.270
but I am so terrified of losing
my salary, losing my identity,

00:33:50.270 --> 00:33:51.750
and starting again.

00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:54.250
So make sure-- and this
goes for men and women--

00:33:54.250 --> 00:33:57.330
the people you lead, you
must understand their values

00:33:57.330 --> 00:34:00.710
and where they want to go
and what feels juicy to them.

00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:02.260
And give them
stretch opportunities

00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:05.290
that help them meet
those aspirations.

00:34:05.290 --> 00:34:09.300
For women in particular,
it's incredibly important.

00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:10.600
So tip number one.

00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:12.860
Be aware of the lizard.

00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:15.739
Tip number two, create space.

00:34:15.739 --> 00:34:17.820
This is in a few ways.

00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:20.980
I've talked to a few people
around the conversational style

00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:21.489
of Google.

00:34:21.489 --> 00:34:23.590
I don't think this is
necessarily a problem here,

00:34:23.590 --> 00:34:25.199
but it may be in
other organizations

00:34:25.199 --> 00:34:28.580
you go on to work for.

00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:32.639
The dominant conversational
style in many organizations

00:34:32.639 --> 00:34:35.033
tends to be quite
masculine and competitive.

00:34:35.033 --> 00:34:37.449
It doesn't mean that women
can't do it spectacularly well.

00:34:37.449 --> 00:34:38.865
I'm not talking
men and women, I'm

00:34:38.865 --> 00:34:40.920
talking masculine
versus feminine.

00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:43.060
And certainly when I was
in management consulting,

00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:45.300
I got so good at this-- I
call it the tennis match

00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:47.908
style-- where it's like,
bam, I'm really smart.

00:34:47.908 --> 00:34:49.199
Then bam, I'm smarter than you.

00:34:49.199 --> 00:34:50.550
But bam, here's my point.

00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:52.110
And no one's actually
listening to each other.

00:34:52.110 --> 00:34:54.109
It's sort of like look
at me, look what I can do

00:34:54.109 --> 00:34:56.389
and look how I can think.

00:34:56.389 --> 00:34:59.565
And I got so good at this style
that one Christmas I went home,

00:34:59.565 --> 00:35:02.090
and my mom said
to me, oh darling,

00:35:02.090 --> 00:35:03.800
you're getting a bit bossy.

00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:05.560
So we can get
really good at this,

00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:10.080
but this style tends-- as I
said, it's a masculine style.

00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:13.470
It tends to favor the loudest
and most competitive voices.

00:35:13.470 --> 00:35:16.447
And I've worked with a lot
of tech companies where women

00:35:16.447 --> 00:35:19.030
in particular, not always, but
women in a particular feel like

00:35:19.030 --> 00:35:24.670
they cannot get heard, and
their voices aren't listened to.

00:35:24.670 --> 00:35:27.180
So my suggestion for
leaders is to name

00:35:27.180 --> 00:35:30.284
the conversational style
you've got in your team.

00:35:30.284 --> 00:35:31.700
Once you give it
a name, encourage

00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:32.620
people to call it out.

00:35:32.620 --> 00:35:35.540
If you feel like it's not an
inclusive conversational style,

00:35:35.540 --> 00:35:38.310
encourage people to
call that style out.

00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:39.720
Oh, it's not a tennis match.

00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:41.761
Let's just get onto-- or
it's not a tennis match.

00:35:41.761 --> 00:35:44.210
Let's see what Catherine
has to say, et cetera.

00:35:44.210 --> 00:35:46.380
Another way we need
to create space

00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:50.070
is that did you know women,
on average, get interrupted

00:35:50.070 --> 00:35:51.590
three more times than men?

00:35:51.590 --> 00:35:54.630
Three to one.

00:35:54.630 --> 00:35:59.110
I was telling this to-- I was
sitting in Cafe at Palo Alto.

00:35:59.110 --> 00:36:01.146
Have you ever been to Valencia?

00:36:01.146 --> 00:36:02.882
Good coffee.

00:36:02.882 --> 00:36:04.340
Anyway, I was
sitting at this cafe,

00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:06.902
and this very loud
VC kind of guy

00:36:06.902 --> 00:36:08.110
started asking me what I did.

00:36:08.110 --> 00:36:12.572
I started telling him and
he's well-- I was talking,

00:36:12.572 --> 00:36:14.030
he said, well, I've
got my opinions

00:36:14.030 --> 00:36:15.154
on women in leadership.

00:36:15.154 --> 00:36:16.770
You're kind of proving my point.

00:36:16.770 --> 00:36:21.600
So make sure that you are
not interrupting women

00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:24.187
and that you're not
insisting that women

00:36:24.187 --> 00:36:25.770
are the ones that
say excuse me, can I

00:36:25.770 --> 00:36:26.853
finish what I have to say?

00:36:26.853 --> 00:36:29.770
Call the interruptions
in your team

00:36:29.770 --> 00:36:32.690
in a really nonaggressive way.

00:36:32.690 --> 00:36:36.240
I think Catherine had
something to say there.

00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:36.920
Right.

00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:40.010
Third way to create
space, make sure there's

00:36:40.010 --> 00:36:43.760
a space for women-only
programs-- women-only

00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:44.920
initiatives.

00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:47.350
And I know this is
really controversial,

00:36:47.350 --> 00:36:50.097
and a number of organizations
I've worked with that

00:36:50.097 --> 00:36:51.180
say, oh, we can't do that.

00:36:51.180 --> 00:36:52.320
It's politically incorrect.

00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:53.611
We need to bring the men along.

00:36:53.611 --> 00:36:56.350
Of course, we need-- and I'm so
glad there are men here today.

00:36:56.350 --> 00:36:59.710
Of course, it's gender diversity
benefits men and women.

00:36:59.710 --> 00:37:01.070
Absolutely, of course.

00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:07.170
The results are in terms of
meeting potential and lifting

00:37:07.170 --> 00:37:08.050
performance.

00:37:08.050 --> 00:37:10.230
When you get women in
a leadership program

00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:13.580
together, three to one.

00:37:13.580 --> 00:37:15.050
Results are improved
three to one

00:37:15.050 --> 00:37:17.335
versus a gender-mixed
leadership program.

00:37:17.335 --> 00:37:21.480
So that's another way to
create space for women.

00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:24.120
So tip number one, make sure
you're aware of the lizard.

00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:28.580
Tip number two, create space.

00:37:28.580 --> 00:37:29.600
Excellent.

00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:30.740
Tip number three.

00:37:33.350 --> 00:37:36.130
This is an important one.

00:37:36.130 --> 00:37:37.700
Get it.

00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:40.320
Get gender diversity.

00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:42.840
Make it your mission
to understand,

00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:46.540
not just intellectually,
so I need

00:37:46.540 --> 00:37:48.870
leaders to understand
not just, yes, I

00:37:48.870 --> 00:37:52.270
know that when you reach gender
parity, executive level or at

00:37:52.270 --> 00:37:54.570
leadership level, everything
changes in organization.

00:37:54.570 --> 00:37:57.980
I know the 58% of executives
in America are women.

00:37:57.980 --> 00:37:58.700
I know that.

00:37:58.700 --> 00:37:59.830
I don't know you know this.

00:37:59.830 --> 00:38:02.246
You've got a better chance of
being named CEO of a Fortune

00:38:02.246 --> 00:38:05.640
500 company here if your name
is John than if you're a woman.

00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:07.890
So I know this.

00:38:07.890 --> 00:38:11.600
And it's really important as
leaders for you to get it here,

00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:13.677
to get it emotionally.

00:38:13.677 --> 00:38:15.260
And one of the things
we do when we're

00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:17.480
working with executive
teams is, with permission

00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:21.230
from the people on the team, we
put pictures of their daughters

00:38:21.230 --> 00:38:23.350
up on a slide show.

00:38:23.350 --> 00:38:27.440
And we say because your
daughter was born a girl,

00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:30.687
she's this percent less
likely to become a CEO.

00:38:30.687 --> 00:38:32.270
She's this percent
less likely-- she's

00:38:32.270 --> 00:38:35.890
this percent more likely to
have violence done to her.

00:38:35.890 --> 00:38:39.700
Once you make it personal, once
you think of a girl or a woman

00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:42.310
you love and what
the research means

00:38:42.310 --> 00:38:45.340
for her and her
life, that's when

00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:48.180
leaders get gender diversity.

00:38:48.180 --> 00:38:48.850
Right.

00:38:48.850 --> 00:38:50.800
I'm going up for
questions in a minute,

00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:54.280
but I do have some
homework for you.

00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:59.140
Homework is commit to
applying one of these tips--

00:38:59.140 --> 00:39:00.910
one of the three
tips I gave you--

00:39:00.910 --> 00:39:02.890
to increase their success.

00:39:02.890 --> 00:39:06.681
If you are people leader, you've
got two tips to commit to.

00:39:06.681 --> 00:39:07.180
OK?

00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:10.390
So one of the first set
and one of the third set.

00:39:10.390 --> 00:39:13.400
And I would love you to email
me at Gemma@InklingWomen.com

00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:16.047
to tell me what
you committed to.

00:39:16.047 --> 00:39:18.130
If you don't get a chance
to ask a question today,

00:39:18.130 --> 00:39:20.505
or there's a question that
you feel is a little personal,

00:39:20.505 --> 00:39:23.170
feel free to email me
at that address too.

00:39:23.170 --> 00:39:24.640
Then the second
bit of homework I

00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:27.250
would love to share one
of the tips with other.

00:39:27.250 --> 00:39:30.270
We believe at Inkling Women
in creating a ripple effect

00:39:30.270 --> 00:39:31.490
in terms of gender diversity.

00:39:31.490 --> 00:39:34.420
So share a tip that you
might have found useful

00:39:34.420 --> 00:39:36.674
with someone today.

00:39:36.674 --> 00:39:38.215
I'd love to open it
up for questions.

00:39:41.721 --> 00:39:44.900
AUDIENCE: Does anyone have
questions in the audience?

00:39:50.930 --> 00:39:52.860
AUDIENCE: Question
about three to one.

00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:55.770
Did you say two things about
the three to one ratio?

00:39:55.770 --> 00:39:59.770
One is get three times
interrupted more often

00:39:59.770 --> 00:40:02.885
and another is that you include
women in your congregation

00:40:02.885 --> 00:40:06.460
or gathering so decision
making you have some result?

00:40:06.460 --> 00:40:08.030
The second one I
don't follow you on.

00:40:08.030 --> 00:40:09.613
GEMMA MUNRO: [INAUDIBLE]
I understand.

00:40:09.613 --> 00:40:13.510
So in terms of results
in individual performance

00:40:13.510 --> 00:40:17.880
in a mixed leadership program
versus a women-only leadership

00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:20.590
program, you get
three to one results

00:40:20.590 --> 00:40:22.590
with a women's leadership
program for women.

00:40:22.590 --> 00:40:24.330
Obviously, don't put men in
a women's leadership program,

00:40:24.330 --> 00:40:26.240
because that would perhaps be
a little bit weird for them.

00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:28.920
But the women who go on a
women-only leadership program

00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:31.017
achieve three to
one results in terms

00:40:31.017 --> 00:40:32.850
of getting promoted,
in terms of performance

00:40:32.850 --> 00:40:36.400
ratings from their peers
and their executives.

00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:38.320
Does that make sense?

00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:41.660
So women-only programs
for women are more

00:40:41.660 --> 00:40:43.769
effective than mixed programs.

00:40:43.769 --> 00:40:46.310
We've got a white paper on it
if anyone wants me to share it.

00:40:46.310 --> 00:40:49.718
I'm happy to Just email me.

00:40:49.718 --> 00:40:50.520
Other questions?

00:40:54.340 --> 00:40:56.000
AUDIENCE: Do you
have tips for how

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:57.790
to handle being interrupted?

00:40:57.790 --> 00:40:59.020
GEMMA MUNRO: Yes, I do.

00:40:59.020 --> 00:41:00.625
I get asked this
question so much,

00:41:00.625 --> 00:41:03.060
I actually made a video on
it, how to insert yourself

00:41:03.060 --> 00:41:04.350
into the conversation.

00:41:04.350 --> 00:41:06.816
But I'll share a couple
of them with you today.

00:41:06.816 --> 00:41:08.690
If you want to email
me, I'm happy to forward

00:41:08.690 --> 00:41:10.430
you that video.

00:41:10.430 --> 00:41:13.020
One is the broken
record technique.

00:41:13.020 --> 00:41:15.240
So you just keep
saying the same thing.

00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:18.040
So what I think on this is,
so what I think on this is,

00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:19.380
so what I think on this is.

00:41:19.380 --> 00:41:23.370
You feel like an idiot, but
it did eventually works.

00:41:23.370 --> 00:41:25.460
Another thing is to
actually call it,

00:41:25.460 --> 00:41:27.270
but when you call
the interruption,

00:41:27.270 --> 00:41:31.080
you need to make sure
there's no emotion involved.

00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:32.725
So what I think
is-- Kevin, can you

00:41:32.725 --> 00:41:33.560
let me finish what I'm saying?

00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:34.890
It's always Kev-- I
always call guys Kevin.

00:41:34.890 --> 00:41:35.598
I don't know why.

00:41:37.825 --> 00:41:39.700
Kevin, can you let me
finish what I'm saying?

00:41:39.700 --> 00:41:43.480
And actually call it there
in a really calm way.

00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:47.440
And the third thing is, if
you've tried one and two

00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:51.080
and neither of them work,
let them have their rant,

00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:53.280
because often it's a rant.

00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:55.820
And then at the end,
summarize what they've said.

00:41:55.820 --> 00:41:57.780
So Kevin, what I've
heard is bop bop bop.

00:41:57.780 --> 00:41:58.499
Here's my view.

00:41:58.499 --> 00:42:00.040
And if you do that,
you actually tend

00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:01.960
to sound like the smartest
person in the room.

00:42:04.820 --> 00:42:05.320
Yeah.

00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:08.320
I'll just [INAUDIBLE] the
mic if that's all right?

00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:11.100
AUDIENCE: So any tip on--
so what if your manager

00:42:11.100 --> 00:42:14.440
wants you to sit on the back
seat instead of a leader?

00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:15.150
And what if he--

00:42:15.150 --> 00:42:16.090
GEMMA MUNRO: What seat, sorry?

00:42:16.090 --> 00:42:16.880
AUDIENCE: Back seat.

00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:17.838
GEMMA MUNRO: Back seat.

00:42:17.838 --> 00:42:18.620
Got it, sorry.

00:42:18.620 --> 00:42:20.036
AUDIENCE: And what
if he wants you

00:42:20.036 --> 00:42:23.090
to-- the same
solution and problem.

00:42:23.090 --> 00:42:25.850
He'd rather listen to a
man than listen to you.

00:42:25.850 --> 00:42:27.600
So you have to go
through a second channel

00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:29.200
in order to convey the message.

00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:30.720
GEMMA MUNRO: Yes.

00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:35.910
That's really difficult.
Before I give you a tip,

00:42:35.910 --> 00:42:38.396
I've noticed there
is almost-- and I

00:42:38.396 --> 00:42:40.270
don't know your situation,
of course, at all.

00:42:40.270 --> 00:42:43.264
But I have noticed there's
almost this discrimination

00:42:43.264 --> 00:42:45.180
that in some ways it's
reverse discrimination.

00:42:45.180 --> 00:42:51.770
I see some men have kind of a
caring patronizing sense of,

00:42:51.770 --> 00:42:53.885
oh, that would be
too hard for you.

00:42:53.885 --> 00:42:55.760
Like I don't want to
put you in the deep end,

00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:57.330
and they do this for women.

00:42:57.330 --> 00:43:00.590
And I honestly had this
male exec come and talk

00:43:00.590 --> 00:43:03.080
to these women that we're
running a program with,

00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:04.680
and he talked about
his story and how

00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:06.570
he was crying at nights,
and he was vomiting

00:43:06.570 --> 00:43:07.780
because it was horrible.

00:43:07.780 --> 00:43:10.470
But he's so glad he went through
that because now he's here.

00:43:10.470 --> 00:43:13.690
And then he left the room,
and these women said to me,

00:43:13.690 --> 00:43:15.470
they don't do that to me.

00:43:15.470 --> 00:43:17.589
He won't give me
those opportunities,

00:43:17.589 --> 00:43:19.130
because he's looking
after me, and he

00:43:19.130 --> 00:43:21.090
wants me to be protected.

00:43:21.090 --> 00:43:22.560
So we've got to watch that.

00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:25.809
In terms of actually
managing that,

00:43:25.809 --> 00:43:27.850
I'm hesitant to give you
a tip, because it really

00:43:27.850 --> 00:43:32.750
depends on the personality
of the guy involved.

00:43:32.750 --> 00:43:36.358
Have you had a conversation
with him about it?

00:43:36.358 --> 00:43:37.640
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:38.830
Observe and learn.

00:43:38.830 --> 00:43:40.840
GEMMA MUNRO: Observe and learn?

00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:41.970
Yeah?

00:43:41.970 --> 00:43:46.352
So I'm wondering if-- again,
it depends on the person.

00:43:46.352 --> 00:43:50.970
I don't want to give you advice
that could get you fired.

00:43:50.970 --> 00:43:54.520
So you know, that
caveat in place.

00:43:54.520 --> 00:43:56.660
I found what works
the best is actually

00:43:56.660 --> 00:44:01.110
calling that and saying,
here's my perception.

00:44:01.110 --> 00:44:03.650
Please tell me if I'm wrong.

00:44:03.650 --> 00:44:06.310
My sense is you don't want
me to move into a leadership

00:44:06.310 --> 00:44:09.160
position, and you're quite
happy for me to stay here.

00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:11.580
I do want to move into
a leadership position.

00:44:11.580 --> 00:44:13.170
So can we have
that conversation?

00:44:13.170 --> 00:44:15.830
And, again, no aggression there.

00:44:15.830 --> 00:44:17.460
There's no emotion.

00:44:17.460 --> 00:44:20.030
It's just stating as it is
in a really factual way.

00:44:20.030 --> 00:44:22.050
I've done that before two guys.

00:44:22.050 --> 00:44:24.730
I've called two guys
out for sexist behavior,

00:44:24.730 --> 00:44:29.300
and they actually tend
to go, oh, I had no idea.

00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:30.790
So that would be my suggestion.

00:44:30.790 --> 00:44:32.742
No worries.

00:44:32.742 --> 00:44:33.720
Other questions.

00:44:38.457 --> 00:44:39.290
We will come to you.

00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:47.070
AUDIENCE: Sometimes I
get comments from people

00:44:47.070 --> 00:44:50.170
that I don't really
know what to make of,

00:44:50.170 --> 00:44:51.580
and they're nice people.

00:44:51.580 --> 00:44:55.730
But they'll say that
women, in general,

00:44:55.730 --> 00:44:58.580
might have an easier time,
let's say, finding a job in tech

00:44:58.580 --> 00:45:02.680
because there's been all
this attention to equality,

00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:05.840
and there's just a lack
of women applicants.

00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:08.155
And then they'll make
it sound like, oh yeah,

00:45:08.155 --> 00:45:10.530
you got your job because your
a girl-- like a little bit,

00:45:10.530 --> 00:45:13.370
not too much, but a little bit.

00:45:13.370 --> 00:45:15.470
How can I deal with that?

00:45:15.470 --> 00:45:16.220
GEMMA MUNRO: Yeah.

00:45:16.220 --> 00:45:17.500
That is such a good question.

00:45:17.500 --> 00:45:19.540
And, again, it depends on
the kind of person you are

00:45:19.540 --> 00:45:21.414
and how much you feel
like you could get away

00:45:21.414 --> 00:45:22.440
with in the situation.

00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:25.330
But I've been known to say
to people who have insinuated

00:45:25.330 --> 00:45:27.740
that, to say, have you ever
thought that maybe you're

00:45:27.740 --> 00:45:29.967
here because you're a guy?

00:45:29.967 --> 00:45:31.550
So maybe you're in
the position you're

00:45:31.550 --> 00:45:38.240
at-- we've had generations
where male leaders have

00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:39.210
been advantage.

00:45:39.210 --> 00:45:41.220
Have you ever thought
the you are here simply

00:45:41.220 --> 00:45:42.720
because of your gender?

00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:45.450
And that tends to shut
them up pretty quickly.

00:45:45.450 --> 00:45:49.359
But that does require
a little bit of oh-ah.

00:45:49.359 --> 00:45:50.900
There's a good word
for that, but I'm

00:45:50.900 --> 00:45:52.649
sure it's rude so I'm
not going to use it.

00:45:52.649 --> 00:45:55.610
It does require some encourage.

00:45:55.610 --> 00:45:57.576
If not, I actually
think just calling that

00:45:57.576 --> 00:45:58.950
and actually asking
the question.

00:45:58.950 --> 00:46:01.220
Again, in completely
non-emotional way,

00:46:01.220 --> 00:46:03.470
are you saying that I'm here
just because I'm a woman?

00:46:03.470 --> 00:46:04.914
I'm not smart enough to be here?

00:46:04.914 --> 00:46:07.330
And you watch them retreat
back from that position really,

00:46:07.330 --> 00:46:07.955
really quickly.

00:46:12.889 --> 00:46:14.805
AUDIENCE: I had a question
about making space.

00:46:14.805 --> 00:46:15.750
GEMMA MUNRO: Yes.

00:46:15.750 --> 00:46:18.060
AUDIENCE: So you mentioned
that in meetings, especially

00:46:18.060 --> 00:46:20.290
in business, there
can be a culture

00:46:20.290 --> 00:46:21.830
within the meeting
or a tone that's

00:46:21.830 --> 00:46:24.960
combative or masculine and loud.

00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:27.040
I'm wondering what the
characteristics are

00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:28.880
of a feminine tone
in meetings and also

00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:31.560
if there are any leaders or
forums that you could point me

00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:32.060
to.

00:46:32.060 --> 00:46:34.070
Because when I'm
thinking of examples,

00:46:34.070 --> 00:46:37.730
I think whether it's politics
or sports or television shows,

00:46:37.730 --> 00:46:38.420
it's everywhere.

00:46:38.420 --> 00:46:40.940
It's loud, and it's in your
face, and it's combative.

00:46:40.940 --> 00:46:43.610
And so what are examples
of the other side?

00:46:43.610 --> 00:46:44.800
GEMMA MUNRO: Absolutely.

00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:46.090
I love that question.

00:46:46.090 --> 00:46:49.380
Actually, when I was working
in this consultancy that did

00:46:49.380 --> 00:46:51.930
have this masculine
tennis match style,

00:46:51.930 --> 00:46:54.710
and I was really
feeling that pressure

00:46:54.710 --> 00:46:56.680
to be other than who I was.

00:46:56.680 --> 00:46:59.540
At the same time, I started
working with this male project

00:46:59.540 --> 00:47:02.690
director who had quite a
feminine style of conversation.

00:47:02.690 --> 00:47:05.850
And it actually
felt like ideas were

00:47:05.850 --> 00:47:09.490
allowed to blossom rather
than shut down, shut down.

00:47:09.490 --> 00:47:13.300
So stupid ideas were
allowed to percolate.

00:47:13.300 --> 00:47:17.540
Ideas that were
raised were given--

00:47:17.540 --> 00:47:20.050
what's the word-- were
actually acknowledged,

00:47:20.050 --> 00:47:22.040
we're given acknowledgement.

00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:27.780
And a more feminine style, there
is a sense of yes and rather

00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:28.970
than no but.

00:47:28.970 --> 00:47:30.720
Yes and.

00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:33.560
In terms of examples, can
you leave that with me,

00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:35.302
and can I get your
details afterwards?

00:47:35.302 --> 00:47:37.260
That's a really good
question, and I don't have

00:47:37.260 --> 00:47:39.080
anyone springing to mind sadly.

00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:41.130
So I'd love to email
you some examples

00:47:41.130 --> 00:47:43.217
once I've given it some thought.

00:47:43.217 --> 00:47:45.550
AUDIENCE: Let's do a question
from the Dory really fast.

00:47:45.550 --> 00:47:48.680
So when you think about some
of the best leaders you've

00:47:48.680 --> 00:47:50.550
observed slash
worked with, what are

00:47:50.550 --> 00:47:52.650
some of the characteristics
or behaviors

00:47:52.650 --> 00:47:54.660
they have that make them great?

00:47:54.660 --> 00:47:56.170
GEMMA MUNRO: Yeah.

00:47:56.170 --> 00:47:59.370
There's actually some
research done by Gallup.

00:47:59.370 --> 00:48:03.560
And the research was
done on 10,000 followers

00:48:03.560 --> 00:48:05.800
and looking at what
these followers needed

00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:07.220
from their leaders.

00:48:07.220 --> 00:48:08.870
And I know this
research, and I also

00:48:08.870 --> 00:48:11.790
know the leaders I've worked
with that I have responded best

00:48:11.790 --> 00:48:13.850
to, and they do it align.

00:48:13.850 --> 00:48:16.870
So the Gallup research
says that followers require

00:48:16.870 --> 00:48:20.670
leaders to provide stability.

00:48:20.670 --> 00:48:23.420
So I don't know if you've
ever had a leader where

00:48:23.420 --> 00:48:26.426
you never quite know what you're
going to get on a certain day.

00:48:26.426 --> 00:48:29.050
And some days it's like, oh, is
it going to be eggshells today?

00:48:29.050 --> 00:48:31.690
And you're kind of tentatively
walking into the office.

00:48:31.690 --> 00:48:33.700
Providing a sense of
stability is important.

00:48:33.700 --> 00:48:35.230
Creating hope.

00:48:35.230 --> 00:48:37.999
Creating a sense of here's
what the future looks like.

00:48:37.999 --> 00:48:39.790
And it's going to be
incredible, and here's

00:48:39.790 --> 00:48:41.940
how we're going to
get there together.

00:48:41.940 --> 00:48:45.260
Showing compassion is another
one that's really important

00:48:45.260 --> 00:48:46.880
and building trust.

00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:50.450
If you as a leader can
do those four things,

00:48:50.450 --> 00:48:51.760
then followers respond.

00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:54.343
And I've certainly had leaders
that have been able to do that.

00:48:58.910 --> 00:49:00.910
AUDIENCE: A common
criticism of leading advice

00:49:00.910 --> 00:49:02.720
is that it places
the burden on women

00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:05.350
to deal with the
consequences of a system not

00:49:05.350 --> 00:49:06.670
of their own making.

00:49:06.670 --> 00:49:08.960
How can organizations
help redirect

00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:12.720
that burden to be even
more evenly shared?

00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:14.386
GEMMA MUNRO: I just
want to say, whoever

00:49:14.386 --> 00:49:17.560
asked that, I love that
question, because it's so true.

00:49:17.560 --> 00:49:20.570
We were pitching
for this program

00:49:20.570 --> 00:49:26.510
with 10 high-potential women
in a car sales organization

00:49:26.510 --> 00:49:30.840
and where the top 50
leaders were male.

00:49:30.840 --> 00:49:33.370
No female in the top
50 level leaders.

00:49:33.370 --> 00:49:35.640
And one of their
aims for this program

00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:38.040
was at the end of
the program, women

00:49:38.040 --> 00:49:39.550
will able to champion
gender equity

00:49:39.550 --> 00:49:41.800
and change the culture
in the organization.

00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:46.540
You are putting that burden on
10 women in the organization.

00:49:46.540 --> 00:49:48.550
So for me, it's
incredibly important

00:49:48.550 --> 00:49:52.177
that, yes, we need to
make sure that women

00:49:52.177 --> 00:49:54.760
have the confidence and skills
to navigate an environment that

00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:58.020
is less than ideal
for some women.

00:49:58.020 --> 00:50:00.850
At the same time though, you
cannot do that without working

00:50:00.850 --> 00:50:05.280
with the organization's leaders
to help them get it and to give

00:50:05.280 --> 00:50:07.910
them the skills to help these
women who are actually being

00:50:07.910 --> 00:50:09.210
developed to thrive.

00:50:09.210 --> 00:50:12.210
So to me, it always has
to be that joint approach.

00:50:12.210 --> 00:50:13.940
And what you're
looking for in the end

00:50:13.940 --> 00:50:18.100
is you're wanting women to climb
up through the leadership path

00:50:18.100 --> 00:50:19.990
to become leaders
in the organization

00:50:19.990 --> 00:50:22.304
and eventually to have
enough critical mass there

00:50:22.304 --> 00:50:24.345
to shape how work gets
done in that organization.

00:50:27.889 --> 00:50:29.680
AUDIENCE: You were
mentioning the gentleman

00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:32.720
at the cafe who had an
opinion about what you do.

00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:34.720
So I'm just wondering
what he had to say or just

00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:37.682
generally what do
the skeptics say?

00:50:37.682 --> 00:50:38.390
GEMMA MUNRO: Yes.

00:50:38.390 --> 00:50:39.660
OK.

00:50:39.660 --> 00:50:44.430
His view was, well, you
just-- I have this male voice.

00:50:44.430 --> 00:50:45.990
I know men don't
all talk like this,

00:50:45.990 --> 00:50:47.720
but he was quite blustery.

00:50:47.720 --> 00:50:51.154
Well, I get women
and I'm able to tell

00:50:51.154 --> 00:50:53.320
the men in my organization
what they're doing wrong,

00:50:53.320 --> 00:50:54.340
and I say that to
women, and they

00:50:54.340 --> 00:50:56.250
say you're just saying
that because I'm a woman.

00:50:56.250 --> 00:50:58.333
And they've just got a big
chip on their shoulder.

00:50:58.333 --> 00:51:00.890
And at that point, I
started to switch off a bit,

00:51:00.890 --> 00:51:02.274
but I actually did fight back.

00:51:02.274 --> 00:51:03.690
You tend to get a
number of-- it's

00:51:03.690 --> 00:51:05.065
a really good
question-- you tend

00:51:05.065 --> 00:51:07.620
to get a number of common
reactions from people.

00:51:07.620 --> 00:51:10.990
One is I think the
issue is overstated.

00:51:10.990 --> 00:51:14.150
One is women don't need fixing.

00:51:14.150 --> 00:51:16.350
And actually I do
have a video that I

00:51:16.350 --> 00:51:19.220
made on how to respond
to the common reactions--

00:51:19.220 --> 00:51:22.380
the common negative reactions
to gender diversity.

00:51:22.380 --> 00:51:24.208
So if anyone wants
that, just let me know,

00:51:24.208 --> 00:51:24.650
I'm happy to share.

00:51:24.650 --> 00:51:26.520
I think I went through
six common reactions,

00:51:26.520 --> 00:51:27.686
and here's what you can say.

00:51:33.010 --> 00:51:34.850
AUDIENCE: So usually
the behaviors--

00:51:34.850 --> 00:51:38.720
the measured behavior, right--
so if you're working with a lot

00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:43.140
of men and not women, you
tend to become-- you know,

00:51:43.140 --> 00:51:46.000
to survive, you want to
become like them a little bit

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:48.100
to be able to work with them.

00:51:48.100 --> 00:51:50.000
But maybe you don't like that.

00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:52.640
Maybe end of the day, you
don't want to be like that.

00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:56.010
And so that's very
conflicting kind of feeling.

00:51:56.010 --> 00:51:56.990
You do it.

00:51:56.990 --> 00:51:59.340
Maybe it works,
but end of the day,

00:51:59.340 --> 00:52:01.340
you don't want to be like that.

00:52:01.340 --> 00:52:02.960
GEMMA MUNRO: Absolutely.

00:52:02.960 --> 00:52:05.540
And it's actually natural.

00:52:05.540 --> 00:52:08.700
Albert Bandura has this
social learning theory--

00:52:08.700 --> 00:52:11.500
we learn by imitating others
and by mimicking others.

00:52:11.500 --> 00:52:13.430
And if the dominant
leadership style

00:52:13.430 --> 00:52:16.050
has been masculine, competitive,
hierarchical, et cetera,

00:52:16.050 --> 00:52:18.860
that's what we tend to learn
we need to do to be successful.

00:52:18.860 --> 00:52:20.230
Is a survival thing.

00:52:20.230 --> 00:52:23.770
We imitate so that we can
survive in a certain situation.

00:52:23.770 --> 00:52:25.660
At the same time
though, there can

00:52:25.660 --> 00:52:28.930
be a sense of
inauthenticity and feeling

00:52:28.930 --> 00:52:30.690
like I'm not being
exactly who I am.

00:52:30.690 --> 00:52:32.780
And that feels icky too.

00:52:32.780 --> 00:52:34.480
So you have hit the
nail on the head.

00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:36.039
You are absolutely right.

00:52:36.039 --> 00:52:38.080
One thing I suggest to
people who find themselves

00:52:38.080 --> 00:52:40.730
in this situation, and it's
men and women too, by the way.

00:52:40.730 --> 00:52:43.160
I was working with an
all-male executive team,

00:52:43.160 --> 00:52:47.804
and the CEO said to me, well--
I was about to say his name.

00:52:47.804 --> 00:52:49.845
Let's say he's called
Kevin, because as you know,

00:52:49.845 --> 00:52:51.439
I call all men Kevin.

00:52:51.439 --> 00:52:52.855
Well, Kevin, you
know, he's great.

00:52:52.855 --> 00:52:54.996
He's performing well,
but he can't fit in.

00:52:54.996 --> 00:52:55.745
He's a vegetarian.

00:52:55.745 --> 00:52:56.750
He doesn't eat sausages.

00:52:56.750 --> 00:52:57.458
He doesn't drink.

00:52:57.458 --> 00:52:59.000
I'm like, oh my god.

00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:02.396
How inclusive are not
being at the moment?

00:53:02.396 --> 00:53:04.270
What I suggest to men
and women who feel like

00:53:04.270 --> 00:53:06.880
they're in a situation where
they cannot be themselves is

00:53:06.880 --> 00:53:09.570
to start making little tweaks.

00:53:09.570 --> 00:53:11.445
So not suddenly coming
into work as yourself,

00:53:11.445 --> 00:53:13.236
because that's going
to feel way too scary,

00:53:13.236 --> 00:53:15.550
and your colleagues will go--
they'll sort of whiplash.

00:53:15.550 --> 00:53:16.049
Who are you?

00:53:16.049 --> 00:53:17.950
I don't really
trust you anymore.

00:53:17.950 --> 00:53:20.190
But making little tweaks,
just planning a little

00:53:20.190 --> 00:53:22.784
tweak you can make to be
more yourself at work.

00:53:22.784 --> 00:53:24.950
Some of them you actually
find, actually this great.

00:53:24.950 --> 00:53:26.860
People respond to be better.

00:53:26.860 --> 00:53:28.584
So just build that up.

00:53:28.584 --> 00:53:31.000
Eventually, if you feel like
you're trying to be yourself,

00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:33.260
and it doesn't work in
this environment, that's

00:53:33.260 --> 00:53:34.850
when you need to
start thinking, well,

00:53:34.850 --> 00:53:36.200
is this the right
environment for me?

00:53:36.200 --> 00:53:38.074
Do I need to find an
environment where I feel

00:53:38.074 --> 00:53:40.696
like I can be truly who I am.

00:53:40.696 --> 00:53:42.570
AUDIENCE: We have time
for one more question.

00:53:42.570 --> 00:53:43.320
GEMMA MUNRO: Yeah.

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:47.500
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
from the Dory.

00:53:47.500 --> 00:53:49.540
So bravado versus bravery.

00:53:49.540 --> 00:53:52.280
A lot of leaders have
this fake it 'til make it

00:53:52.280 --> 00:53:54.140
bluster and pretense
way of leading

00:53:54.140 --> 00:53:57.720
but may not always have
your back when it counts.

00:53:57.720 --> 00:54:02.160
What are the attributes of
a truly brave change maker?

00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:05.200
GEMMA MUNRO: What
a great question.

00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:07.940
I ironically think the
attributes of someone

00:54:07.940 --> 00:54:12.260
who's brave and who's changing
the way things get done,

00:54:12.260 --> 00:54:15.380
one of the attributes is
absolutely vulnerability.

00:54:15.380 --> 00:54:18.420
So bravado, for me, is
look how great I am.

00:54:18.420 --> 00:54:20.760
Look what I can do.

00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:22.977
There is that sense
of bluster about it.

00:54:22.977 --> 00:54:24.560
Having said that, I
do think sometimes

00:54:24.560 --> 00:54:26.150
you have to fake it
until you make it.

00:54:26.150 --> 00:54:28.710
But if you are doing
that and at the same time

00:54:28.710 --> 00:54:32.400
you're not being honest and open
with others about where you're

00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:35.540
struggling, being honest
and open with others

00:54:35.540 --> 00:54:37.620
and being vulnerable
and actually

00:54:37.620 --> 00:54:41.900
having that sense
of here's who I am,

00:54:41.900 --> 00:54:45.770
you don't tend to be respected
by those who follow you.

00:54:45.770 --> 00:54:48.950
We actually follow people
who show us who they are.

00:54:48.950 --> 00:54:52.270
And that requires opening
themselves up and telling

00:54:52.270 --> 00:54:55.150
people what they are
afraid of and giving people

00:54:55.150 --> 00:54:56.610
a sense of this
is where we're at.

00:54:56.610 --> 00:54:57.568
These are the problems.

00:54:57.568 --> 00:55:00.540
I am really nervous, and
yet I see this fabulous goal

00:55:00.540 --> 00:55:01.350
for the future.

00:55:01.350 --> 00:55:03.183
And here's how we're
going to work together.

00:55:03.183 --> 00:55:07.210
I think the other attribute--
so bravado tends to be me me me.

00:55:07.210 --> 00:55:10.200
Brave tends to be let's
bring people along.

00:55:10.200 --> 00:55:12.670
So it's not about me,
it is about this team

00:55:12.670 --> 00:55:15.880
and creating results as a team.

00:55:15.880 --> 00:55:17.230
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much.

00:55:17.230 --> 00:55:19.980
[APPLAUSE]
