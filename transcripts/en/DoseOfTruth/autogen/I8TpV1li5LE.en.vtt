words falsely and the reason for that
like there's a good series of social

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800
like there's a good series of social

psychology experiments that show like
imagine that you bring someone into a

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489
imagine that you bring someone into a
 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.180
imagine that you bring someone into a
lab and you have them write an essay

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190
lab and you have them write an essay
 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.040

about or fill out a questionnaire about
 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.440
about or fill out a questionnaire about
their political opinions so you get a

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450
their political opinions so you get a
 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.880
their political opinions so you get a
baseline measure of their political

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890
baseline measure of their political
 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.160
baseline measure of their political
stance and then you ask them to write a

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170
stance and then you ask them to write a
 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.150

thousand words

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160
thousand words
 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.160
thousand words
maybe they identify as right-wing and

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170
maybe they identify as right-wing and
 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.049
maybe they identify as right-wing and
then you get them to write a thousand

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059
then you get them to write a thousand
 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.150
then you get them to write a thousand
word essay on why a particular left-wing

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160
word essay on why a particular left-wing
 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.630
word essay on why a particular left-wing
position is true and then you have them

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640
position is true and then you have them
 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.189
position is true and then you have them
come back in two weeks and you give them

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199
come back in two weeks and you give them
 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.870

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.160
they'll tell have shifted quite
radically towards the left and the

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170
radically towards the left and the
 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.200
radically towards the left and the
reason for that is that people don't

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210
reason for that is that people don't
 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.270
reason for that is that people don't
think through their positions in great

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280
think through their positions in great
 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.300
think through their positions in great
detail and so if you get them to think

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310
detail and so if you get them to think
 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.920
detail and so if you get them to think
through a contrary position in great

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930
through a contrary position in great
 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.109
through a contrary position in great
detail than that starts to become more

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119
detail than that starts to become more
 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.840
detail than that starts to become more
convincing and so if you go into a field

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850
convincing and so if you go into a field
 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.649
convincing and so if you go into a field
like education that's really

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659
like education that's really
 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:30.140
like education that's really

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400
neo-marxist types you're going to
 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.980
neo-marxist types you're going to
experience a tremendous amount of

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990
experience a tremendous amount of
 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.810
experience a tremendous amount of
pressure to falsify your words you're

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820
pressure to falsify your words you're
 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.219
pressure to falsify your words you're
going to be afraid that if you don't do

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229
going to be afraid that if you don't do
 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.800
going to be afraid that if you don't do
that you're going to fail and maybe

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810
that you're going to fail and maybe
 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.990
that you're going to fail and maybe
sometimes you will be punished by a

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000
sometimes you will be punished by a
 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.609
sometimes you will be punished by a
professor but I would say in most

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619
professor but I would say in most
 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.050
professor but I would say in most
circumstances I'm still optimistic

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060
circumstances I'm still optimistic
 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.880
circumstances I'm still optimistic
enough to believe that if you write a

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890
enough to believe that if you write a
 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.609
enough to believe that if you write a
good essay that isn't ideologically

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619
good essay that isn't ideologically
 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.499
good essay that isn't ideologically
proper you'll still get a good grade and

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509
proper you'll still get a good grade and
 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.240
proper you'll still get a good grade and
I guess I would say if you write a good

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250
I guess I would say if you write a good
 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.890
I guess I would say if you write a good
essay that's not ideological

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:54.900
essay that's not ideological
 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.210
essay that's not ideological
proper and you don't get a good grade

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220
proper and you don't get a good grade
 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.360
proper and you don't get a good grade
that's probably a good time to fight

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:58.370
that's probably a good time to fight
 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:00.620
that's probably a good time to fight
so because you either fight or

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630
so because you either fight or
 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.380
so because you either fight or
capitulate right that's that's the

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390
capitulate right that's that's the
 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.770
capitulate right that's that's the
that's the hard truth so I'm not saying

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780
that's the hard truth so I'm not saying
 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.359
that's the hard truth so I'm not saying
it would be easy and I would also say

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369
it would be easy and I would also say
 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.720
it would be easy and I would also say
don't make unnecessary enemies right you

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730
don't make unnecessary enemies right you
 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.130
don't make unnecessary enemies right you
know everything doesn't have to be a

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140
know everything doesn't have to be a
 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.690
know everything doesn't have to be a
battle but now then you're gonna know

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700
battle but now then you're gonna know
 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.940
battle but now then you're gonna know
that you know you'll hate writing the

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950
that you know you'll hate writing the
 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.130
that you know you'll hate writing the
essay because you have to sacrifice your

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140
essay because you have to sacrifice your
 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.830
essay because you have to sacrifice your
soul in order to put the words down and

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840
soul in order to put the words down and
 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.320
soul in order to put the words down and
then you you you Dement and warp your

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330
then you you you Dement and warp your
 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.060
then you you you Dement and warp your
character and you just don't recover

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070
character and you just don't recover
 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.699
character and you just don't recover
easily from that so I would say don't do

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709
easily from that so I would say don't do
 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:32.270
easily from that so I would say don't do
that man that's not good
