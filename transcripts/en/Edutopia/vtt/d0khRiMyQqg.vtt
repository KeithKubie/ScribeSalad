00:00:09.046 --> 00:00:10.566
&gt;&gt;Did you get one of these?

00:00:10.566 --> 00:00:11.526
&gt;&gt;I did.

00:00:12.096 --> 00:00:14.336
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Once a month, a
group of students and teachers

00:00:14.336 --> 00:00:17.916
at Hudson High School on
the outskirts of Boston meet

00:00:17.916 --> 00:00:19.326
to discuss school issues.

00:00:19.326 --> 00:00:23.186
&gt;&gt;Okay, just a few quick
announcements, and then we'll move

00:00:23.186 --> 00:00:25.476
on to issues of cluster
accountability,

00:00:25.556 --> 00:00:27.676
a report from that team,
and the dress code.

00:00:28.066 --> 00:00:30.746
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In this community
council, when it comes time to vote,

00:00:30.746 --> 00:00:33.686
students have the final
say, over everything

00:00:33.686 --> 00:00:36.936
from the school's dress code
to the menu in the cafeteria.

00:00:37.296 --> 00:00:40.586
&gt;&gt;I'm fuzzy on when there's conflict.

00:00:40.586 --> 00:00:42.816
How is the resolution
actually worked out?

00:00:42.866 --> 00:00:45.506
&gt;&gt;These are all simple
majority procedures.

00:00:46.066 --> 00:00:46.306
&gt;&gt;Okay.

00:00:47.586 --> 00:00:49.966
&gt;&gt;Sean: Normally, when you
think of the classroom,

00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:53.756
if the teacher says something,
you normally think of it as right,

00:00:54.036 --> 00:00:55.446
and if a student says
something, you always look

00:00:55.446 --> 00:00:57.266
to the teacher to reconfirm that.

00:00:57.926 --> 00:01:01.416
However, in community council,
it's now whoever says it,

00:01:01.786 --> 00:01:03.266
it's automatically valid.

00:01:03.386 --> 00:01:07.066
&gt;&gt;The community council decided that
there would be no credits, but still,

00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:09.536
Doctor Berman wanted some
sort of accountability.

00:01:09.916 --> 00:01:13.626
&gt;&gt;Sheldon: Public education was
formed because the country wanted

00:01:13.726 --> 00:01:18.046
to develop a public from which a
democracy could thrive, an educated,

00:01:18.166 --> 00:01:20.406
thoughtful, concerned public.

00:01:20.546 --> 00:01:22.296
That's, I think, the primary mission

00:01:22.466 --> 00:01:24.216
that we still have
in public education.

00:01:24.736 --> 00:01:27.186
It's the melding of
different perspectives.

00:01:27.186 --> 00:01:29.466
It's the bringing together
of different viewpoints.

00:01:30.136 --> 00:01:32.686
&gt;&gt;Narrator: As one of twenty
schools in the nation to take part

00:01:32.686 --> 00:01:36.376
in the First Amendment Schools
Project, Hudson forces teachers

00:01:36.376 --> 00:01:39.756
to take a back seat in the
council's democratic process.

00:01:39.756 --> 00:01:41.256
&gt;&gt;Brian: I'm biting my
tongue all the time.

00:01:41.876 --> 00:01:43.446
"Oh, yeah, I know the
solution to that."

00:01:43.446 --> 00:01:46.366
But that's not how this
system is designed to work,

00:01:46.626 --> 00:01:48.486
but that we find the
solution together.

00:01:48.796 --> 00:01:49.926
&gt;&gt;A move to a straw vote.

00:01:49.926 --> 00:01:50.626
All those in favor...

00:01:50.806 --> 00:01:53.526
&gt;&gt;Narrator: For a school of
1,000 students, it's a challenge

00:01:53.526 --> 00:01:56.356
to get everyone to come
together around any issue.

00:01:56.546 --> 00:01:57.266
&gt;&gt;Motion passes.

00:01:57.346 --> 00:01:58.486
&gt;&gt;Narrator: So the school decided

00:01:58.486 --> 00:02:02.046
to break the student body
down into groups of 100.

00:02:02.046 --> 00:02:06.256
Called clusters, the self-organized
groups meet one period each week

00:02:06.556 --> 00:02:10.956
to pursue non-academic interests,
everything from soup to knots.

00:02:11.096 --> 00:02:11.776
&gt;&gt;Oh, I messed up again.

00:02:12.776 --> 00:02:15.866
&gt;&gt;Eleni: We were thinking of
interest groups for the clustering

00:02:15.866 --> 00:02:19.226
that we're doing, and so we thought,
well, why not have them knit hats

00:02:19.226 --> 00:02:24.616
for the homeless, and we put out
some sign-up sheets, and someone came

00:02:24.616 --> 00:02:27.246
and said we had to
stop the sign-up sheets

00:02:27.246 --> 00:02:29.006
because so many kids were signing up.

00:02:29.166 --> 00:02:32.686
And so we called the senior
citizens and asked for help,

00:02:32.686 --> 00:02:35.806
and I thought it would be a lovely
opportunity for one generation

00:02:35.806 --> 00:02:37.666
to make friends with
another generation.

00:02:37.836 --> 00:02:39.576
&gt;&gt;Fran: People will say
to you, "High-school kids?

00:02:39.606 --> 00:02:41.246
Whoa!" But it's not "whoa."

00:02:41.666 --> 00:02:45.526
I don't see any "whoa" at any age.

00:02:45.526 --> 00:02:48.436
I think they're good
kids, really good.

00:02:48.526 --> 00:02:51.486
&gt;&gt;I like it because it relieves
stress, and I play hockey

00:02:51.486 --> 00:02:53.176
and I have a lot of stress.

00:02:53.646 --> 00:02:54.466
&gt;&gt;Sheldon: It's very important

00:02:54.466 --> 00:02:57.206
that we personalize the high-school
education for adolescents.

00:02:57.556 --> 00:03:02.956
They are at a time when they
need not only the academic skills

00:03:02.956 --> 00:03:05.416
and knowledge that they're
learning, but they need to be

00:03:05.416 --> 00:03:07.546
in an environment that's
a caring environment.

00:03:07.826 --> 00:03:08.926
&gt;&gt;We need more berries.

00:03:09.626 --> 00:03:12.256
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In the wellness
cluster, students practice everything

00:03:12.256 --> 00:03:14.636
from meditation to meal preparation.

00:03:14.766 --> 00:03:18.446
&gt;&gt;Julie: This group over here is
trying to make healthy ways to cook,

00:03:18.516 --> 00:03:20.186
and something that will
give them nutrient value.

00:03:20.186 --> 00:03:22.846
And our interest group gives them
opportunities, and they get involved

00:03:22.846 --> 00:03:26.176
in something that they're passionate
about, hopefully, and in our case,

00:03:26.176 --> 00:03:28.036
it's the idea of wellness.

00:03:28.246 --> 00:03:30.756
&gt;&gt;Narrator: To allow students the
freedom to pursue their passions

00:03:30.756 --> 00:03:34.266
on their own schedule, Hudson
created the Virtual High School.

00:03:35.676 --> 00:03:39.816
For Zoe McNealy, it means being able
to pursue her Olympic skating dreams

00:03:39.816 --> 00:03:45.756
in the morning and her coursework
any time of day or night.

00:03:45.846 --> 00:03:48.506
&gt;&gt;Nancy: Zoe has been doing the VHS
classes since she was a freshman

00:03:48.506 --> 00:03:51.906
at Hudson High School,
and it has enabled her

00:03:52.096 --> 00:03:55.376
to leave school during the
day so that she could skate

00:03:55.936 --> 00:04:00.076
on an ice surface that didn't
have 20 children skating on it.

00:04:00.076 --> 00:04:06.106
&gt;&gt;Zoe: So I can log on anywhere that
has Internet access, so it allows me

00:04:06.146 --> 00:04:11.696
to either access the work at
competitions or I can access it

00:04:11.696 --> 00:04:14.216
when I come home and get
the work done that I missed

00:04:14.576 --> 00:04:15.736
without really missing anything.

00:04:16.796 --> 00:04:21.086
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Virtual High School is
now a consortium of 364 high schools

00:04:21.266 --> 00:04:23.626
in the U.S. and 18 foreign countries,

00:04:23.876 --> 00:04:26.436
offering more than 200
courses over the Internet.

00:04:27.166 --> 00:04:29.326
&gt;&gt;Man: We wanted to provide
opportunities for students

00:04:29.326 --> 00:04:32.626
to take advanced courses,
to take specialized courses,

00:04:32.666 --> 00:04:35.246
to try to accelerate their learning.

00:04:35.906 --> 00:04:37.246
&gt;&gt;Student: This is
almost like a textbook.

00:04:37.246 --> 00:04:38.446
All of my controls are here.

00:04:39.196 --> 00:04:40.376
&gt;&gt;Narrator: For Zubin Patel,

00:04:40.376 --> 00:04:43.666
VHS means taking advanced
computer science courses,

00:04:43.666 --> 00:04:45.626
like cryptography, at home.

00:04:46.246 --> 00:04:49.736
&gt;&gt;Zubin: The VHS basically
allows me to take these courses

00:04:49.736 --> 00:04:51.116
that aren't offered at school.

00:04:51.746 --> 00:04:52.596
It means extra work.

00:04:52.596 --> 00:04:57.266
It means staying up some nights 'til
three in the morning doing VHS work,

00:04:57.836 --> 00:05:02.256
but, you know, you have
to do what you have to do.

00:05:02.286 --> 00:05:04.336
&gt;&gt;Narrator: While the Virtual
High School allows students

00:05:04.336 --> 00:05:07.286
to explore courses that aren't
normally offered at Hudson,

00:05:07.676 --> 00:05:11.816
it is no substitute for real-world
lessons learned there every day.

00:05:11.906 --> 00:05:14.556
&gt;&gt;Could you do a bit of
background information?

00:05:14.556 --> 00:05:14.756
&gt;&gt;Sure.

00:05:15.096 --> 00:05:18.126
&gt;&gt;Sheldon: I don't believe you can
have a completely virtual education.

00:05:18.606 --> 00:05:20.256
I think the social environment

00:05:20.256 --> 00:05:21.736
of the high school is an
important environment.

00:05:22.536 --> 00:05:25.336
I think it's important
that we mix the two.

00:05:25.336 --> 00:05:27.966
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The council lived
a lesson in the First Amendment

00:05:27.966 --> 00:05:31.016
when it considered the rights
of a student conservative club.

00:05:31.356 --> 00:05:33.626
&gt;&gt;Reporter: So how far does
the First Amendment go?

00:05:33.906 --> 00:05:36.666
Students here at Hudson are
now testing those limits.

00:05:37.046 --> 00:05:40.686
One school club says it has the
right to freedom of expression,

00:05:40.946 --> 00:05:44.936
but school administrators say that
expression may be too extreme.

00:05:45.316 --> 00:05:48.466
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In posters hung
at the school, the club tried

00:05:48.466 --> 00:05:51.686
to recruit new members by
directing them to an Internet site

00:05:51.806 --> 00:05:54.336
that featured Iraq beheading videos.

00:05:54.606 --> 00:05:58.166
&gt;&gt;There were some relatively
inflammatory things on the site,

00:05:58.396 --> 00:06:01.216
videos that were showing
Islamic terrorist beheadings.

00:06:01.406 --> 00:06:03.806
&gt;&gt;Within a day of putting up
those posters with the website,

00:06:04.046 --> 00:06:07.326
the school takes down the posters
and tells us to censor them.

00:06:07.536 --> 00:06:10.946
&gt;&gt;The administration may not
have handled it the best way,

00:06:11.356 --> 00:06:15.226
but I do think it was
within their right to say,

00:06:15.226 --> 00:06:17.086
"We don't want this
hung up in our school."

00:06:17.086 --> 00:06:20.286
&gt;&gt;Sheldon: That is what democracy is
about, those kinds of controversy,

00:06:20.286 --> 00:06:24.506
those kinds of questions, and I think
our students will walk away, I hope,

00:06:24.626 --> 00:06:27.796
feeling that they had the opportunity
to voice those kinds of differences.

00:06:28.056 --> 00:06:32.106
&gt;&gt;Sean: It creates a community
that can think, can reason,

00:06:32.106 --> 00:06:35.616
can hold disagreeing opinions
but still be civic about it.

00:06:35.616 --> 00:06:37.876
&gt;&gt;Brian: We're doing
something unique in the nation

00:06:37.876 --> 00:06:41.476
and people are noticing it
and it's not always easy.

00:06:41.996 --> 00:06:43.206
In fact, it's not easy at all.

00:06:43.416 --> 00:06:45.916
But I think it's worth doing.

00:06:45.976 --> 00:06:48.366
I'm proud to be part
of it with you all.

00:06:49.396 --> 00:06:51.356
