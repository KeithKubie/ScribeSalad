00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.354
So I think the most important thing you
can do in the early days trying to get

00:00:03.354 --> 00:00:05.295
people to come work for
you is beg really well.

00:00:05.295 --> 00:00:08.340
And there's some truth to that, really.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.910
But the thing you can offer people
at that stage of a company is

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.330
impact and vision and passion and
that they can't get anywhere else.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.970
I mean sure, you need to set up
the incentives and compensation so

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:22.640
that it makes sense.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.048
They're going to make a sacrifice
joining you early in this journey,

00:00:26.048 --> 00:00:28.770
almost certainly, right?

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.483
There's some opportunity cost for you.

00:00:30.483 --> 00:00:32.665
There's some opportunity cost for
your early employees.

00:00:32.665 --> 00:00:34.458
And that could last years.

00:00:34.458 --> 00:00:37.390
So you want to set up incentives
in such a way and compensation and

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.420
such such a way that it's fair and
equitable, equity.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.750
But the thing that you really offer
them, I mean everybody offers equity.

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.460
And it's worth the paper
it's printed on, literally.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.461
What you can really sell people on and
really get people excited about is

00:00:52.461 --> 00:00:55.763
the impact they'll have and the vision
that you have and the product itself and

00:00:55.763 --> 00:00:57.084
the changes that you can make.

00:00:57.084 --> 00:01:01.130
Even if it's just, it doesn't have
to be a world changing product.

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:03.790
But the ability,
people want to have an impact.

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.830
The kind of people you want to hire
desperately want to have an impact.

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.500
And that's what you can give them that
they can't, they go to a larger company,

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.690
that impact is necessarily diminished.

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.860
And so I always talk more about
the impact and the learning and

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.860
the roles and
the fact that they will be making more

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.630
decisions then they'll probably make
it any other time in their life.

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.370
And the right people for those early
hires will just gravitate towards that.

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:30.926
And the sort of compensation in dealing
with the sort of sacrifice that they're

00:01:30.926 --> 00:01:34.072
making, the opportunity cost of
their incurring, is just details.

00:01:34.072 --> 00:01:37.010
You just get them excited about
the impact that they can have.
