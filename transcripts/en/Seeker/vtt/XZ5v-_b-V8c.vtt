00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:07.870
What could possibly be so valuable on the
moon that you’d pay $50 million to go there?

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:15.740
Hey guys, Emily here for DNews.

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:20.330
During the Apollo days, it cost about $10
billion current-day dollars to send astronauts

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.740
on a round trip flight to the moon.

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.859
Back then, we made the trip for things like
national pride, to prove that our missiles

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:30.720
were bigger than Russia’s, and of course
‘not because it was easy, but because it

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:31.980
was hard.’

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.430
Today we have a new space race to the moon.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.870
There are officially 5 teams left in the $30
Million Google Lunar X-PRIZE.

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.120
This is an international competition to see
which private company can reach the moon first,

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:49.469
move 500 meters across its surface and transmit
high definition video and images back to Earth.

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.969
But the really exciting part is what happens
after the competition.

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:59.060
With resources like water ice and Helium-3,
the moon is ripe for mining with a potential

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.309
value of hundreds of trillions of dollars.

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.980
Based on information gathered from orbiting
satellites, NASA estimates that there’s

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:11.540
over 600 metric tons of water ice located
in craters on the North Pole of the Moon.

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.110
This may not seem that exciting - water’s
not that rare or expensive, right?

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.770
Until you realize that water can be converted
into rocket fuel - something that is crazy

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:22.810
expensive.

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.100
This means we could effectively create a gas
station on the moon.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.960
Water, H2O, can be broken down into hydrogen
and oxygen, which can then be converted into

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.450
rocket fuel.

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.409
Many of our rockets today use liquid hydrogen
and liquid oxygen to power their engines - including

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:40.650
our old friend the space shuttle.

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.840
In fact, this type of rocket fuel is the most
fuel efficient of any known chemical rocket

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:45.840
propellant.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.579
If we were able to do this on the moon, then,
anyone who wanted to send a spacecraft on

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:55.060
a particularly long mission would stop at
this lunar gas station and pay you to refuel

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.950
before continuing their journey into deep
space.

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.680
We all know how wealthy and powerful the oil
and gas companies are here on Earth - imagine

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.530
if you had a monopoly on rocket fuel in the
entire solar system!

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.750
But there’s more than just water.

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:14.670
Helium 3 is a special isotope of Helium that’s
rare on the Earth but abundant on the Moon.

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.440
This is appealing because Helium 3 could be
used to create clean nuclear energy via nuclear

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:25.440
fusion without all the radioactive byproducts
that result from traditional nuclear fission.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.440
Yay!

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.720
… The downside is that scientists haven’t
quite worked out all the kinks of nuclear

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.270
fusion just yet.

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:35.960
But, theoretically if they did and someone
could extract all of the Helium 3 from the

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:41.980
lunar soil, there would be enough to power
the entire Earth for thousands of years.

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.020
Ya.

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.240
So maybe it’s no wonder why companies like
Moon Express - the only U.S. company left

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:53.490
in the competition - has been able to secure
a total of $45 million in private investment,

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:55.490
fully funding their first flight to the moon.

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:00.440
In fact, the most unique aspect of this competition
is that unlike the Apollo days - this race

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.040
to the moon isn’t government sponsored.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.490
X-Prize requires 90% of any funding to come
from private sources.

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:09.050
The goal of that requirement?

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:13.510
To encourage profit-driven business plans
based on lunar activities.

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.940
Afterall, what Venture Capitalist would invest
in a company with no promise of financial

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:18.940
return?

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.740
The challenge is, going to the moon is incredibly
expensive and very difficult.

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:28.490
It’s no wonder why only 3 groups in history
- the government superpowers of the United

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:33.150
States, the Soviet Union, and China - have
successfully soft-landed on the moon — in

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.350
other words, landed without crashing.

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.980
This means that whoever places first in the
X-PRIZE competition won’t simply win a grand

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:45.420
prize, but they’ll be the first private
company and the 4th entity in history to soft-land

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:46.460
on the moon.

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:50.910
Sure, they’ll need many more flights dedicated
to prospecting and perfecting their lunar

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:56.060
mining skills - but if there’s a chance
they could create the go-to gas station in

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:01.710
the solar system or even solve the planet’s
energy needs - it may just be all worth it

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:02.930
in the end.

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:06.680
So if one of these companies finds an easier
way to get to the moon, could people actually

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:07.910
live up there?

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:11.750
We talk about whether we could make a livable
atmosphere on the moon in this video, here.

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:12.750
What do you think?

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.700
Who's going to be the next person to make
it to the moon?
