00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:06.220
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:08.280
&gt;&gt; Susan K. Siegel: Good afternoon.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.160
I have the privilege of
introducing our very special

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.150
and very talented interviewer
for this program.

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:20.780 position:56%
He's one of the nation's leading
philanthropists, a tireless advocate

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:24.780
of reading and literacy, a great
friend of the Library of Congress,

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.650
and the individual most
responsible for ensuring

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.360
that there is a National
Book Festival year

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.510
after year, David Rubenstein.

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:50.410
[ Applause ]

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.450
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: I know
I couldn't do that so -- .

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:55.810
So we're very privileged today

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.510
to have Diane Rehm
as our special guest.

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:04.320
[ Applause ]

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.000
So, sounds like everybody
knows who she is

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.960
but I'll give a very
brief introduction

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.040
and then we'll cover a lot of
her life in the discussion.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.870
But she's a native of the
Washington area, actually graduated

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:17.640
from Roosevelt High School.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:24.450
She -- other Roosevelt -- and
then she decided to volunteer

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.250
for a radio talk show on WAMU

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:35.100
and ultimately she became the
host of that show in 1979.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.860
And subsequently that show, which
was called "The Kaleidoscope"

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.770
at the time, was renamed "The Diane
Rehm Show" in 1984 I think it is?

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.070
&gt;&gt; Diane Rehm: Right.

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.370
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:47.180
And subsequently it was
made an NPR broadcast

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.480
and not just a Washington
broadcast but nationwide.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:59.500 position:56%
Diane, in addition to hosting that
show every weekday for now 37 years,

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.510
and she will retire from that
show at the end of this year.

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:09.810
[ Laughter ]

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.460
She is, in addition to
that, she's an author.

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.010
She's written several
books about her life.

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.030
And the most recent one which we're
going to talk about is right here.

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.520
I will show for my own.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.700
I have read it and it's
thoroughly enjoyable.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.650
I highly recommend it because
it's a very personal story

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.540
about being alone after her husband
passed away and their relationship.

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.530 position:56%
And we'll get into that in a moment.

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:39.640
So why don't we start by
saying did you ever think

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:45.980 position:56%
that you would be a nationwide radio
host and have a show for 37 years

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.860
when you started volunteering
in 1973?

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.470
&gt;&gt; Diane Rehm: Never
in a million years.

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.620
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: And the
reason you didn't think so is

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.840
because you didn't, you weren't
trained as a broadcast person.

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.350 position:56%
In fact, as you mentioned in your
book, you graduated from high school

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.290
and your parents did not really
expect, you couldn't afford to go

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.800
to college so you went right
into work, is that right?

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.210
&gt;&gt; Diane Rehm: As a secretary.

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:12.510
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Okay.

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.440
And your parents thought that
was an appropriate kind of thing

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.420
for somebody in that
situation at that time.

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:18.720
&gt;&gt; Diane Rehm: Absolutely.

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.540
And thought I would
marry, have children,

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:29.220 position:56%
and follow a prescriptive Arab life.

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.270
My father came here
from Beirut, Lebanon.

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:39.170
My mother came here
from Alexandria, Egypt.

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:43.930
I'm first generation,
full blooded Arab.

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:49.760
And they really expected me
to follow in that pattern.

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.510
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Now
your parents, your father came

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.330
from Beirut, your mother
came from Egypt but she was

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.830
from Beirut or Lebanon initially?

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:04.460
&gt;&gt; Diane Rehm: They were both born
in Mersin which was in Turkey.

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:08.250
There was no Syria at the time.

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.380
My father's family
then went to Lebanon.

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:16.800
My mother's family went
to Alexandria, Egypt.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.270
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: And
people may not realize it

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:20.140
but there's obviously
a Christian population

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:21.440
in those countries and was.

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.730
And so you're actually, you
were raised in a Greek Orthodox?

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:26.030
&gt;&gt; Diane Rehm: Syrian
Orthodox Church.

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:27.330
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
Syrian Orthodox Church.

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:28.630
&gt;&gt; Diane Rehm: Right.

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.390 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: So you went
to work at the State Department -- .

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:32.690
&gt;&gt; Diane Rehm: Yes.

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:33.990
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Eventually.

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:35.290
And you had a job as
a secretary typist.

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:36.590
&gt;&gt; Diane Rehm: Quite right.

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:37.950
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
And so your goal was

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:40.980
to get married and
please your parents?

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.280
&gt;&gt; Diane Rehm: Absolutely.

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:47.150
My mother in fact was
dying at the time

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:53.330
and she wanted me to marry an Arab.

00:04:53.330 --> 00:05:01.970
And she was lying on the couch in
our living room when I was married.

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.700
She died two months later.

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:10.160
And my father died ten months
after that of a broken heart.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.970
I was nineteen.

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:13.880
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Your mother
was 40 years old when she died?

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.180
&gt;&gt; Diane Rehm: Forty-nine.

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:16.480
&gt;&gt; Daivd M. Rubenstein: Forty-nine.

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:17.780
And she died of cirrhosis.

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:19.080
&gt;&gt; Diane Rehm: She did.

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.380
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: But
she wasn't a drinker so how did

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:21.680
that cirrhosis come about?

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:22.980
&gt;&gt; Diane Rehm: We have no idea.

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:24.720
Absolutely no idea.

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:33.090
She and my father used to have a
single shot of whisky on Christmas

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:35.800
and New Year's and that was it.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.140
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: So
in a previous book you wrote,

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:41.670 position:56%
your first book, you wrote about the
very complicated relationship you

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:43.510
had with your mother.

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:47.770
And it was the subject of much
of the book in terms of trying

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:49.620
to free yourself from
some of the memories.

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:52.720
And are you able to talk about
how that was so complicated

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:57.170
and why it kind of propelled you
forward to a career later on?

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:05.270
&gt;&gt; Diane Rehm: You know, in an Arab
household one never asks questions.

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:12.740
As a child one took what one's
parents said and that was it.

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:16.010
There were no questions asked.

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:20.800
There was no, "Why do
I have to do this?"

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.570
or "Why can't I do this?"

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:33.330 position:56%
And the irony, David, is that here I
am all these years later asking all

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:35.010
the questions I want to ask.

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:36.310
[ Laughter ]

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:37.610
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:41.030
So you pleased your parents
I guess to some extent.

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:44.060 position:56%
You did get married relatively young

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:46.460
and that marriage lasted
for a few years.

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:47.760
&gt;&gt; Diane Rehm: Two years.

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:49.060
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Two years.

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:51.760
And then you decided to later
get married to John Rehm.

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:53.060
&gt;&gt; Diane Rehm: Exactly.

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:54.790
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: And
he was a well educated lawyer

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:57.300
from Harvard, Columbia Law School.

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:01.810
So did you feel at the time he was
well educated, you had only gone

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:05.190
to high school graduation,
was that a problem

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:08.520
or you didn't think it
would be a challenge or -- ?

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:15.140
&gt;&gt; Diane Rehm: He became my teacher
and that was the relationship.

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:19.640
And he loved it and so did I.

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:25.980
I could have asked him any question
about politics, about history,

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:31.180
about music, about
art, about literature

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:34.330
and he could help me learn.

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:36.850
And that's what he did.

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:39.390
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: So you
had a fairly traditional marriage

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:40.690
early on.

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:41.990
You had two children.

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:43.290
&gt;&gt; Diane Rehm: Right.

00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:44.590
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
And you have two children

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:45.890
and they're now grown
and living elsewhere.

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:47.190
&gt;&gt; Diane Rehm: Right.

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:48.490
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
And you have grandchildren.

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:49.790
&gt;&gt; Diane Rehm: Yes.

00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:52.550
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: And so
when your children were growing

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:55.880
up you decided to maybe try
to do something else other

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:57.180
than raise your children.

00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:00.150
What propelled you to try to
do something else at the time?

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:07.070 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Diane Rehm: I think it was in
the midst of the feminine revolution

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:13.820
when all of us of my era
began asking ourselves,

00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:16.980
"Is there something else?"

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:21.080
My children were at the
time fourteen and eleven

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:28.940
and I thought what's going to
happen to me after they're gone?

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:33.920
They had been my life
for fourteen years.

00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:35.980
What's next?

00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:40.740
Betty Freidan's book came
out and I thought well,

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:42.870
maybe there is something.

00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:48.000
And when the opportunity
to volunteer

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:56.860 position:56%
at this tiny little station, this is
1973, tiny little station not even

00:08:56.860 --> 00:09:05.300
yet a member of NPR because you
had to have five fulltime employees

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:10.760
to become a member of
NPR and we only had two.

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:13.010
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
So you volunteered there

00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:17.080
and what did you do as a
volunteer, what was your job?

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:22.970
&gt;&gt; Diane Rehm: The first day I
got there as a volunteer I was met

00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:28.720
at the door, not by the host,
but by the manager who said,

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:36.510
"I'm so sorry to tell you
but the host is out sick."

00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:39.170
[ Laughter ]

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:44.760
And so she said to me, "So I,
the manager, am going to have

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:52.670
to do the program and I'd like you,
Diane Rehm, to come into the studio

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:56.370
and help me do the program."

00:09:56.370 --> 00:10:04.510
So the very first day as a
volunteer I was on the air in front

00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:07.980
of a microphone for 90 minutes

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:14.040
with a representative
of the Dairy Council.

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:16.070
[ Laughter ]

00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:18.550
Ninety minutes, David.

00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:28.250
Cream, milk, butter, meat and
I knew from my role as a mother

00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:33.630
that the Department of Agriculture
had that food pyramid all wrong.

00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:35.380
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Okay.

00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:38.550
So did you drink any milk
in that interview or no?

00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:39.850
&gt;&gt; Diane Rehm: No.

00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:41.570
I drank no milk in that interview.

00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:42.870
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:

00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:48.530
So eventually you decided there was
an opening for a fulltime position.

00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:49.830
&gt;&gt; Diane Rehm: Indeed.

00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:56.060
The young woman who had been
the assistant producer left

00:10:56.060 --> 00:11:01.790
to have a baby and I was in the
right place at the right time.

00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:04.300
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: So you
got that job and then the person

00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:07.710
who was the host of "Kaleidoscope",
as it was then called,

00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:11.640
said she was leaving the job
and you decided you would apply

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:13.550
or were you sure you were
going to apply for her job?

00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:14.850
&gt;&gt; Diane Rehm: No.

00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:16.560
I was not sure I was going to apply

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:23.480
because at the time I was
doing two part-time jobs.

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:29.550
The Associated Press Radio
Network, I was doing small pieces

00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:32.800
on medical issues for them.

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:40.800 position:56%
And employed part-time by
Physicians Radio Network and getting

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:45.850
up at four o'clock in the morning
to put a microphone in front

00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:52.580
of Joe Califano who was at the time
head of HEW, all medical stuff,

00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:55.130
the head of the FDA, the head

00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:59.600
of whoever was doing
something on medicine.

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:09.340
So two part-time jobs were going
to pay me as much as a fulltime,

00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:15.780
five day week, two
hour on the day program

00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:20.120
and so I did a plus
and a minus list.

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:21.420
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Right.

00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:23.620
&gt;&gt; Diane Rehm: A good and a bad.

00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:31.820
And finally with my husband we
decided I'd go for the WAMU job.

00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:36.470
A hundred other people
across the country applied

00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:39.110
for it and I got the job.

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:41.540
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: And at the
time it was called "Kaleidoscope".

00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:43.030
You didn't say let's
change the name?

00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:44.330
&gt;&gt; Diane Rehm: No.

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:45.970
Not yet. Not yet.

00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:47.270
Not yet.

00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:49.920
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: So to
prepare for those shows you have

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:53.220
to do the research so do you
have people that help you?

00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:55.930
Or did you, in the early days,
people that do the research,

00:12:55.930 --> 00:12:58.350
book the guests, how
did you do all that?

00:12:58.350 --> 00:12:59.740
&gt;&gt; Diane Rehm: David, David, David.

00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:01.040
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
You did it all yourself?

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:05.070
&gt;&gt; Diane Rehm: In those
early days WAMU had no money,

00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:14.680
no resources except to pay for
a few people, the on-air hosts.

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:21.870
I got to the office at 7:30 in the
morning and I was there until 8:30

00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:25.480
at night doing the booking,
doing the researching,

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:29.350
doing the preparation,
doing everything.

00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:38.140
And at the start it was three hours
of day until November of that year

00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:41.350
when "Morning Edition"
came on and then,

00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:45.540
thank God, it was two hours a day.

00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:50.320
Finally my husband said,
"You can't do this anymore.

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:53.020
You're going to drop dead."

00:13:53.020 --> 00:14:01.970
So I finally prevailed upon my then
manager for a part-time assistant.

00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:06.380
And eventually it has
reached that point

00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:13.870
where we have five fulltime
employees and three part-time.

00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:18.510
And I have to tell
you, they're all women.

00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:22.040
[ Applause ]

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:23.440
Thank you.

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:24.740
Thank you.

00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:26.070
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: So have
you ever considered an Affirmative

00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:28.010
Action program for your hiring?

00:14:28.010 --> 00:14:29.900
[ Laughter ]

00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:35.110
&gt;&gt; Diane Rehm: You know, we've
had men as part of the staff.

00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:39.180
They've gone on to do
bigger and better things.

00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:48.910
I've had people come and go but one
of my producers has been with me

00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:55.040
for 22 years, another's
been with me for ten.

00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:56.480
You know, it's wonderful.

00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:58.650
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: So
today you've now been doing this

00:14:58.650 --> 00:14:59.950
for 37 years.

00:14:59.950 --> 00:15:01.250
&gt;&gt; Diane Rehm: Thirty-six.

00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:03.120
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: So of all
the people you've interviewed -- .

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:04.540
&gt;&gt; Diane Rehm: Oh, David.

00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:06.380
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: And
there must be somebody that's --

00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:09.320
what was the most embarrassing
thing that ever happened?

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:10.620
&gt;&gt; Diane Rehm: Oh, you knew.

00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:12.230
I knew you were going to
you were going to ask.

00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:13.980
All right.

00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:17.090
Tom Clancy.

00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:22.760
And before I even tell
you the Tom Clancy story,

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:31.330
at one point today former Speaker
of the House Newt Gingrich,

00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:40.050 position:56%
with his wife, came over and said
to me, "I want to apologize to you."

00:15:40.050 --> 00:15:45.030
I knew exactly why
he was apologizing.

00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:52.870
He had promised to be on
my program for a full hour.

00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:59.940
And at twenty before
the hour he hung up.

00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:04.240
Not because we were
having any disagreements.

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:09.280
He said to me, "I want
to apologize to you.

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:15.110
I left you hanging and you
had to open the phones.

00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:20.190
And all these years I've
felt terrible about it

00:16:20.190 --> 00:16:22.140
and I want to apologize."

00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:26.350
I must be the only
person in the world

00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:30.010
who Newt Gingrich has
ever apologized.

00:16:30.010 --> 00:16:31.310
[ Applause ]

00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:33.110
Really.

00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:36.640
[ Applause ]

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:38.550
So Tom Clancy.

00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:39.850
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Tom Clancy.

00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:41.150
&gt;&gt; Diane Rehm: All right.

00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:44.880
Tom Clancy walks in,
he's got dark glasses on.

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:49.460
I think he's going to take them
off when he comes to the studio.

00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:55.320
Instead he puts his elbow on the
table, puts his hand up like that,

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:59.720
covering his eyes, he
doesn't even look at me.

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:07.020
I ask him a really good
question, he says, "Yep."

00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:15.150
I ask him another really good
question and he says, "Nope."

00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:19.100
And I'm looking at the clock.

00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:23.510
And I'm thinking I've
got two choices.

00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:26.950
I can either say to
him, "Mr. Clancy,

00:17:26.950 --> 00:17:32.990
it's clear you'd rather not be here
so you can just leave and I'll talk

00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:39.250
to the audience," or maybe
he's got some problem with me.

00:17:39.250 --> 00:17:43.280
Maybe he doesn't like me
as many others do or -- .

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:47.590 position:56%
So instead I'll just open the phones

00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:51.960
and let people call
in and talk to him.

00:17:51.960 --> 00:18:01.820
First caller, "Mr. Clancy, we love
your books," and Clancy is smiling.

00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:04.660
And then the caller goes on to say,

00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:09.510
"But you sure are being
arrogant with our Diane."

00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:12.640
[ Applause ]

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:17.810
At which point Tom Clancy
takes his glasses off,

00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:20.940
throws them on the
table and says, "Oh, no.

00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:24.190
We're having a wonderful time.

00:18:24.190 --> 00:18:25.490
Aren't we, Diane?"

00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:28.620
And the guy on the phone
says, "It sure doesn't sound

00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:30.320
that way to us, Mr. Clancy."

00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:36.520
And from then on he's a pussycat
and we have a great energy.

00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:39.740
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: So
is it hard to get people,

00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:41.760
Presidents of the United
States to come on.

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:43.200
You've interviewed a
number of presidents.

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:46.040
So how do you get them or how hard
is it to book somebody like that

00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:48.060
or a Secretary of State
or somebody like that?

00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:49.670
&gt;&gt; Diane Rehm: Well, I'll tell you.

00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:54.890
When I was honored two years ago

00:18:54.890 --> 00:19:01.690
by receiving the Humanities
Presidential Medal I went

00:19:01.690 --> 00:19:09.340
to the White House as many people
did this week including NPR's own

00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:12.260
Terry Gross who won it this year.

00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:14.500
[ Applause ]

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:15.800
Absolutely.

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:20.860
So I went up to the stage to
shake hands with the President

00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:26.230
and the first thing he does is to
whisper into my ear, "You know,

00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:33.410
Diane, I was on your program
before I became President."

00:19:33.410 --> 00:19:38.220
And I whispered back into
his ear, "Yes, Mr. President,

00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:40.860
and it's time for you
to come back on again."

00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:48.870
And so we are currently in
negotiation with the White House

00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:53.220
for me to go into the Oval Office

00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:59.010
to do my last program
on the air [inaudible].

00:19:59.010 --> 00:20:00.310
[ Applause ]

00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:04.170
And we hope that that happens.

00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:06.620
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Now
since you've just announced that,

00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:08.480
it's going to be difficult.

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:09.980
&gt;&gt; Diane Rehm: We hope it happens.

00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:12.840
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: So
when you are an interviewer one

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:15.470
of the most important
things is your voice.

00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:16.770
&gt;&gt; Diane Rehm: Yes.

00:20:16.770 --> 00:20:19.390
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
So when did you realize

00:20:19.390 --> 00:20:23.310
that your voice wasn't working as
well as you had wanted it to work?

00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:25.630
How many years ago was that?

00:20:25.630 --> 00:20:31.950
&gt;&gt; Diane Rehm: It was 1992
when the problem began.

00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:38.180
And it began because --
and I can verify this

00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:41.870
through Senator Barbara Mikulski --

00:20:41.870 --> 00:20:48.970
I started coughing
[coughs] tiny little coughs.

00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:54.830
And the cough became more
frequent and it reached a point

00:20:54.830 --> 00:20:59.420
where Barbara Mikulski was
coming on to the program

00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:03.510
and she was standing there and
I said, "Senator, forgive me."

00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:05.060
I was in tears.

00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:09.130
I said, "I can't do the interview.

00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:11.240
I can't talk."

00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:20.590
And she said, "If you need me,
I can help get you into NIH."

00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:23.670
She said, "What do you
think the problem is?"

00:21:23.670 --> 00:21:30.280
And I said, "Well, I've
been taking a lot of Advil."

00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:36.890
And she said to me, and you can
check on this, she said to me,

00:21:36.890 --> 00:21:39.560
"You know, that is one

00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:45.710
of the reasons we almost
did not approve Advil

00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:49.150
for over the counter sales.

00:21:49.150 --> 00:21:52.900
But we decided to go
forward with it."

00:21:52.900 --> 00:22:00.520
In any case, in order to get a
diagnosis they kept putting tube

00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:04.790
after tube after tube
down my throat.

00:22:04.790 --> 00:22:10.350
They kept saying to me,
"It's all in your head.

00:22:10.350 --> 00:22:16.830
There's nothing wrong with your
throat or your vocal cords."

00:22:16.830 --> 00:22:27.310
Finally, and I'm going to tell you
how I sounded the day I got off the

00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:28.920
air, [inaudible].

00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:32.350
That's how I sounded.

00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:34.020
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
So you went off the air

00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:36.370
and then you began
a search for doctors

00:22:36.370 --> 00:22:37.670
who could actually diagnose it?

00:22:37.670 --> 00:22:38.970
&gt;&gt; Diane Rehm: Nope.

00:22:38.970 --> 00:22:44.980
I had already had that
search from 1992 to 1998

00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:49.990
when I finally went off
the air for four months.

00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:54.370
And my doctor finally
called and said,

00:22:54.370 --> 00:22:58.010 position:56%
"We're sending her to Johns Hopkins.

00:22:58.010 --> 00:23:02.010
We've got to find out if
there's cancer somewhere

00:23:02.010 --> 00:23:06.260
or ALS or Parkinson's."

00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:08.740
And I got to Johns Hopkins.

00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:15.520
I was examined by a neurologist
and an otolaryngologist

00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:23.910
and within one hour they said,
"You have spasmodic dysphonia,"

00:23:23.910 --> 00:23:31.330
which is a problem whose
origins they have no clue on.

00:23:31.330 --> 00:23:36.110
It begins in the vassal
ganglia of the brain.

00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:44.850 position:56%
The vassal ganglia informs the vocal
cords to clamp down inappropriately.

00:23:44.850 --> 00:23:47.380
There is no known cause.

00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:50.520
There is no known cure.

00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:53.740
But there is a treatment

00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:58.250
and I received an injection
of Botox that very day.

00:23:58.250 --> 00:24:00.750
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: So Botox
which is, you know, very -- .

00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:02.050
&gt;&gt; Diane Rehm: Poison.

00:24:02.050 --> 00:24:03.350
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Poison.

00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:04.820
They gave you a little bit of it

00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:08.940
and they told you it would probably
take away your voice for a while.

00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:10.620
And did it do that?

00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:12.770
&gt;&gt; Diane Rehm: It did indeed.

00:24:12.770 --> 00:24:19.000
And for one week I had
absolutely no voice.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.680
I could only whisper.

00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:31.440
And my husband had to put his
ear to my mouth to hear me

00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:34.510
and he said it was the most
intimate time of our marriage.

00:24:34.510 --> 00:24:38.840
[ Laughter ]

00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:42.530
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: So
ultimately the Botox worked.

00:24:42.530 --> 00:24:43.830
&gt;&gt; Diane Rehm: Worked.

00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:45.140
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
And but you still need

00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:47.630
to get Botox repeatedly or not?

00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:51.800
&gt;&gt; Diane Rehm: Every four
months I fly out to Portland,

00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:59.230
Oregon where my doctor from
Johns Hopkins now is and I get

00:24:59.230 --> 00:25:05.040
that injection which I just
had two-and-a-half weeks ago.

00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:09.770
And then went to Dallas,
fell on the plane,

00:25:09.770 --> 00:25:14.890
broke my foot, and
have been at home.

00:25:14.890 --> 00:25:19.120
I go back on the air
finally on Monday.

00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:23.740
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: So with a
few months to go you are booking

00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:26.440
up people and you are trying

00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:28.940
to now get everybody you want
including President Obama.

00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:31.100
I assume, given only a
couple of months to go,

00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:33.510 position:56%
you can get almost anybody you want.

00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:38.680
[ Laughter ]

00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:42.090 position:56%
So is it the opposite problem in the
sense that you have too many people

00:25:42.090 --> 00:25:45.100
who now want to be on and
you can't please them all?

00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:54.250
&gt;&gt; Diane Rehm: We receive
about 250 books a week

00:25:54.250 --> 00:26:01.980
through which we must do a quick
search as to what makes sense

00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:09.600 position:56%
for the program, what balances the
program in terms of art, literature,

00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:16.500
music, history, politics and
that's for the second hour.

00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:24.000
First hour is always decided
just 24 hours in advance.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:28.230
One producer takes charge after we

00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:35.910
as a group have all decided what is
the most important program we need

00:26:35.910 --> 00:26:38.100
to do tomorrow.

00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:39.400
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Okay.

00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:42.300
So when you are booking these
people now you have to prepare

00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:44.160
by reading the books or
getting summaries of them.

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:46.750
How much research do you have
to do every night to kind

00:26:46.750 --> 00:26:48.230
of be ready for the interviews?

00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:56.140
&gt;&gt; Diane Rehm: My producers
do 99 percent of it.

00:26:56.140 --> 00:26:58.930
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: So
you are doing this show now

00:26:58.930 --> 00:27:01.980 position:56%
and you've been doing it for a
number of years as I've pointed out.

00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:06.650
But you had a relationship
with your husband for 52 years.

00:27:06.650 --> 00:27:07.950
&gt;&gt; Diane Rehm: Fifty-four.

00:27:07.950 --> 00:27:09.250
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
Fifty-four years.

00:27:09.250 --> 00:27:10.550
&gt;&gt; Diane Rehm: Mm-hmm.

00:27:10.550 --> 00:27:11.850
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
So what happened

00:27:11.850 --> 00:27:14.980
to your husband's health
a few years ago?

00:27:14.980 --> 00:27:20.850
&gt;&gt; Diane Rehm: After he
retired from the practice

00:27:20.850 --> 00:27:25.940
of international law
he began waiting for me

00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:29.140
to come home for a daily walk.

00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:38.660
And this was a man, six feet tall,
very strong, very fit, and slender,

00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:48.070
and a good strong walk and all of
a sudden I began hearing a shuffle.

00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:54.120
And I turned to him
and said, "Sweetheart,

00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:56.700 position:56%
why aren't you picking up your feet?

00:27:56.700 --> 00:27:59.370
Why are you shuffling?"

00:27:59.370 --> 00:28:02.550
And he said, "I don't know."

00:28:02.550 --> 00:28:09.900
Well, then he began having a
series of automobile accidents

00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:17.090
and with those the insurance
company said after three accidents

00:28:17.090 --> 00:28:24.020
in 18 months we're
cutting out his insurance.

00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:34.770
And I said, or John said --
I'm sorry about this noise --

00:28:34.770 --> 00:28:40.230
John said, "Well, we'll just
find another insurance company.

00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:46.610
And I said, "I think we'd better
have you checked out first."

00:28:46.610 --> 00:28:56.360 position:56%
And it was that series of checks
that finally led us to a neurologist

00:28:56.360 --> 00:29:01.360
at Johns Hopkins who said
John had Parkinson's disease.

00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:02.660
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Okay.

00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:04.970
So he had Parkinson's and
he already had retired

00:29:04.970 --> 00:29:07.340
and he was doing volunteer work.

00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:10.170
&gt;&gt; Diane Rehm: Freer
and Sackler Gallery,

00:29:10.170 --> 00:29:14.640
had studied for a year
to become a docent.

00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:23.860
Was a docent at Freer and Sackler,
then became a reader for the blind

00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:29.310
and dyslexic, and a
volunteer at hospice.

00:29:29.310 --> 00:29:31.850
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: And so
he continued that for a while.

00:29:31.850 --> 00:29:33.150
&gt;&gt; Diane Rehm: Yeah.

00:29:33.150 --> 00:29:34.450
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
But then what happened

00:29:34.450 --> 00:29:37.780
when he became too difficult
to medically treat him,

00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:42.310
you ultimately had to decide to
put him in an assisted living type

00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:43.630
of facility, is that right?

00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:46.440
&gt;&gt; Diane Rehm: We decided
that together

00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:54.080
after he had fallen one night
at three o'clock in the morning.

00:29:54.080 --> 00:30:01.850
And anyone here who has experienced
a person who's fallen knows how

00:30:01.850 --> 00:30:06.160
difficult it is to
get that person up.

00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:13.990
It took me an hour to get him
just onto his knees and then

00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:22.660
to pull him back to
his bed and piece

00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:28.690
by piece get his body
back onto that bed.

00:30:28.690 --> 00:30:33.680
And we knew then he'd have
to go into assisted living.

00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:36.130
So he went into a facility
that you picked out

00:30:36.130 --> 00:30:38.280
and you then visited every day

00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:42.170
but then you could see the
deterioration in him I guess.

00:30:42.170 --> 00:30:46.780
So what was it like -- you lived
together for some 50 years --

00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:50.220
what was it like kind
of being alone?

00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:52.130
Visiting him every
day, living alone.

00:30:52.130 --> 00:30:54.540
&gt;&gt; Diane Rehm: That's
exactly right, David.

00:30:54.540 --> 00:31:01.810
That aloneness began when he
was moved to the facility.

00:31:01.810 --> 00:31:08.670
And I can remember the very
day walking back into our condo

00:31:08.670 --> 00:31:13.910
and realizing, "My
God, for the first time

00:31:13.910 --> 00:31:22.070
in my entire life I
am living alone."

00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:29.060
I had gone from my parents' home
to marriage, to divorce and living

00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:38.900
with a roommate, and then living
with John Rehm for 54 years.

00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:42.960
And now to be alone
for the first time

00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:46.160
in my life was kind of shocking.

00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:49.110
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: And
then you visited him regularly

00:31:49.110 --> 00:31:55.680
but then you can tell that the end
was coming and ultimately he died.

00:31:55.680 --> 00:32:00.340
&gt;&gt; Diane Rehm: John said,
"I am ready to die."

00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:04.580
John said, "I want my doctors here.

00:32:04.580 --> 00:32:09.090
I want Jenny," our
daughter who is a doctor

00:32:09.090 --> 00:32:12.230
in Massachusetts, "on the phone.

00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:14.980
I want our son here.

00:32:14.980 --> 00:32:17.210
And I want you here.

00:32:17.210 --> 00:32:24.260
And I want to say to the
doctor I am ready to die.

00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:28.300
Will you help me?"

00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:35.490
And the doctor said, "In the state
of Maryland I can neither legally,

00:32:35.490 --> 00:32:39.580 position:56%
ethically, nor morally help you die.

00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:48.980
The only thing you can do for
yourself is to stop eating,

00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:54.370
stop taking medication,
and stop drinking water."

00:32:54.370 --> 00:32:59.730
And, as you know, David,
you can go for many, many,

00:32:59.730 --> 00:33:04.870 position:56%
many days without food, even months.

00:33:04.870 --> 00:33:10.650
But if you go without water,
the organs begin to break

00:33:10.650 --> 00:33:16.630
down very quickly and that's what
happened to John within ten days.

00:33:16.630 --> 00:33:20.080
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: So you have
since become a well known advocate

00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:23.730
for the right of people
to decide to die.

00:33:23.730 --> 00:33:26.200
&gt;&gt; Diane Rehm: Be careful
of calling me an advocate

00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:29.660
if anyone from NPR is listening.

00:33:29.660 --> 00:33:32.860
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Well,
okay, you're not an advocate

00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:36.190
because at one point they said you
weren't supposed to be an advocate.

00:33:36.190 --> 00:33:37.490
&gt;&gt; Diane Rehm: Right.

00:33:37.490 --> 00:33:40.060
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: You are
a viewer of, you have views on it

00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:41.400
but you're not an advocate.

00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:42.700
&gt;&gt; Diane Rehm: Right.

00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:44.000
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
But what are your views?

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.070
&gt;&gt; Diane Rehm: My views are,

00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:52.560
my views are that I
should have the right

00:33:52.560 --> 00:34:00.510
to choose what I want
for my own death.

00:34:00.510 --> 00:34:06.790
[ Applause ]

00:34:06.790 --> 00:34:08.090
&gt;&gt; Diane Rehm: Thank you.

00:34:08.090 --> 00:34:11.260 position:56%
And I want to say this very plainly.

00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:18.990
If you believe strongly that
God should be the only decider,

00:34:18.990 --> 00:34:23.530
I support you a thousand percent.

00:34:23.530 --> 00:34:30.540
If you believe that you
want every opportunity

00:34:30.540 --> 00:34:37.180
that medical science
wants, if you want that,

00:34:37.180 --> 00:34:41.000
I support you a thousand percent.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:54.270 position:56%
And if you want the right to die
when you believe your time has come,

00:34:54.270 --> 00:34:58.170
I support you a thousand percent.

00:34:58.170 --> 00:35:06.570
So after I step away from
the microphone in January,

00:35:06.570 --> 00:35:14.760
not only am I going to be doing
a weekly podcast, but I am going

00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:22.640
to be speaking out around the
country about the right to choose,

00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:31.370
to choose for yourself how
you want your life to end.

00:35:31.370 --> 00:35:32.740
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
Now there are some states

00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:34.110
that allow to do that.

00:35:34.110 --> 00:35:35.750
&gt;&gt; Diane Rehm: Five.

00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:37.840
Oregon became the first.

00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:41.310
California, the most recent.

00:35:41.310 --> 00:35:50.650
And like the right to marry
the person you choose,

00:35:50.650 --> 00:35:54.780 position:56%
California became the tipping point.

00:35:54.780 --> 00:36:00.930
I believe the same is true
with death with dignity.

00:36:00.930 --> 00:36:06.270 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: So you'll be
doing that after you end your show.

00:36:06.270 --> 00:36:09.370
Now, in your book you
talk about what it's

00:36:09.370 --> 00:36:12.950
like after your husband did
die and you had to adjust

00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:16.450
to not only living alone, but
having no partner any longer.

00:36:16.450 --> 00:36:19.500
And can you describe what
that feeling was like

00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:24.450
and how you have tried to adjust
in dealing with your friends

00:36:24.450 --> 00:36:27.100
and reacquainting yourself
with other people

00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:28.450
because you now have more time.

00:36:28.450 --> 00:36:34.160
But how do you describe
what the phenomenon it is?

00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:41.950
&gt;&gt; Diane Rehm: I think the
grief, the feeling of loss,

00:36:41.950 --> 00:36:48.960
the yearning for that person
there at breakfast, or at dinner,

00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:53.700
or talking about what's
in the newspaper,

00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:57.350
I don't think that ever goes away.

00:36:57.350 --> 00:37:06.390 position:56%
I think the idea of closure at least
in my own mind has never existed.

00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:12.860
I think the loved ones we
lose are always with us.

00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:20.150
And every time I stand at my window
on the fourteenth floor of my condo

00:37:20.150 --> 00:37:26.120
and it's windows all
along facing west

00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:31.800
and watching the sunset
I think of John.

00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:37.770
I believe that I have
expanded my friendships.

00:37:37.770 --> 00:37:47.000
I've intensified my relationships
with people and I am realizing

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:55.510
that 54 years that we
had were extraordinary

00:37:55.510 --> 00:38:00.830
and precious but life goes on.

00:38:00.830 --> 00:38:07.870
And my life does go
on and we shall see.

00:38:07.870 --> 00:38:10.360
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
So your children live

00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:13.470
in different cities now so
they're not living here.

00:38:13.470 --> 00:38:14.770
&gt;&gt; Diane Rehm: Right.

00:38:14.770 --> 00:38:16.070
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:

00:38:16.070 --> 00:38:17.500
And so therefore you're
grandchildren are not living

00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:18.800
here either?

00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:20.100
&gt;&gt; Diane Rehm: No.

00:38:20.100 --> 00:38:22.370
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: So have you
decided that you'll, post-January,

00:38:22.370 --> 00:38:26.490
you'll put a lot of time
into this advocacy work?

00:38:26.490 --> 00:38:27.790
&gt;&gt; Diane Rehm: Indeed.

00:38:27.790 --> 00:38:29.090
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
And the podcast?

00:38:29.090 --> 00:38:33.450
&gt;&gt; Diane Rehm: I already have
three speaking appointments lined

00:38:33.450 --> 00:38:38.050
up next year for this kind of work.

00:38:38.050 --> 00:38:43.610
And I will be doing
a weekly podcast.

00:38:43.610 --> 00:38:52.290
I hope you will all send to WAMU
your own email addresses so that

00:38:52.290 --> 00:38:58.510 position:56%
when the podcast comes out we'll be
able to connect with you right away.

00:38:58.510 --> 00:39:01.540
[ Applause ]

00:39:01.540 --> 00:39:04.630 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: So as you
look back on 37 years of doing this,

00:39:04.630 --> 00:39:07.100
what would you say is
the highlight of it?

00:39:07.100 --> 00:39:09.220
Is it that you had 37 years?

00:39:09.220 --> 00:39:10.550
You met so many interesting people?

00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:12.820
You have so many people around
the country listen to you?

00:39:12.820 --> 00:39:16.160
What has been the greatest pleasure
out of doing this for 37 years?

00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:18.610
&gt;&gt; Diane Rehm: The
greatest pleasure, David,

00:39:18.610 --> 00:39:26.750
has been the opportunity to
listen, to be in the same room

00:39:26.750 --> 00:39:33.920
with all these wonderful guests,
to learn because I think one

00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:38.540
of the advantages for
me of not going

00:39:38.540 --> 00:39:44.290 position:56%
to college is that I yearn to learn.

00:39:44.290 --> 00:39:51.690
And I have learned every
single day of these 37 years.

00:39:51.690 --> 00:39:57.200
What perhaps I would never
have had the opportunity

00:39:57.200 --> 00:40:02.170 position:56%
to do had I simply been lectured to.

00:40:02.170 --> 00:40:07.050
I'm not a good person to
sit and be lectured to.

00:40:07.050 --> 00:40:09.780
I need to push back a little bit.

00:40:09.780 --> 00:40:11.080
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Right.

00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:12.380
And do your children
give you any advice

00:40:12.380 --> 00:40:15.120 position:56%
about what they thing you should do?

00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:16.420
&gt;&gt; Diane Rehm: Ah.

00:40:16.420 --> 00:40:21.250
No. They keep saying, "Mom,
you're doing too much."

00:40:21.250 --> 00:40:24.000
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Well, I
want to thank you on behalf of all

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.510
of the listeners who listen
to you for so many years.

00:40:26.510 --> 00:40:29.900
I have been one of them and I
was a guest not too long ago.

00:40:29.900 --> 00:40:31.200
&gt;&gt; Diane Rehm: Indeed.

00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:32.500
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: And on
behalf of everybody here I want

00:40:32.500 --> 00:40:34.570
to thank you but I also
want to give you a gift.

00:40:34.570 --> 00:40:37.310
And can the person who
has the gift bring it?

00:40:37.310 --> 00:40:38.780
Here it is.

00:40:38.780 --> 00:40:40.930
This is your, you just
celebrated your eightieth birthday.

00:40:40.930 --> 00:40:42.230
&gt;&gt; Diane Rehm: I did.

00:40:42.230 --> 00:40:49.430
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: And
this is a little birthday gift.

00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:50.730
&gt;&gt; Diane Rehm: Oh, David.

00:40:50.730 --> 00:40:52.030
Oh, David, that's so dear of you.

00:40:52.030 --> 00:40:53.460
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
