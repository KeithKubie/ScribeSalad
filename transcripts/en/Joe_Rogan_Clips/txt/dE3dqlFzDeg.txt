Speaker 1:          00:00          Well, I think the distribution of information has changed so radically over the last couple hundred years and particularly over the last 20 that you're seeing these trends now where more people are inclined to abandon a lot of the, even if you remain religious or remain, you keep a a thought or a belief in a higher power p people are more inclined to entertain these concepts of science and to take in the understanding of what has been observed and documented and written about amongst scholars and academics. And there's more, there's more people accepting that. Have you looked at the number of agnostic people now as opposed to 2030 years ago? It's, it's, it's rising, it's changing. And I think there's also because of you and because of Neil degrasse Tyson and you know, Sean Carroll and all these other people that are public intellectuals that are discussing this kind of stuff, people like myself have a far greater understanding of this then I think people did 30 40 years ago.

Speaker 1:          01:03          Yeah. And that trend is continuing, I think, in a very good direction. Yeah. I mean I don't, you know, well, well we should say is that science, we don't know all the emphasis so we don't know where the laws of nature came from. We don't know why the universe began in the way that it did if avian indeed had a beginning. So I didn't know why the Big Bang was very, very highly oded, which is ultimately a show on Carol. Actually you mentioned him often points out you need right that the, the whole difference, the only difference between the past and the future, the so called Arrow of time is that in the past the universe was really old at and it's getting more disordered and that's that, that, that necessary state of, of, of older, at the start of the universe, which is really the reason that we exist.

Speaker 1:          01:55          That's the reason cause the universe began in a particular form. We don't know why that was. So we, we, we will probably find out at some point and there'll be something to do with the laws of nature. But, so I, I'm always careful. I don't want to, as science can sometimes sound arrogant, right? It can sometimes sound like it's the, it's the discipline of saying to people where you're not, right? Yes. Yeah. And it's not the discipline of saying you are not right it saying this is what we found out. Yeah. So I like to say that it provides a framework within which if you want to philosophize all you want to do theology or you want to, you want to ask these deep questions about why we're here. You have to operate within that framework because it's just an observational framework. So everything we've said is stuff we've discovered.

Speaker 1:          02:43          It's not stuff that someone made up, right? We, we, we, you know, we understand nuclear physics, we can build nuclear reactors, for example. So we understand the physics of styles. So we understand that the styles built the carbon and oxygen and we know how they did it. And we can see, because as I said before, we can, if you look far out into the universe, you're looking way back in time. And as you look back in time, you see less carbon and less oxygen. So we have a direct observation that in the earliest universe there wasn't any cause we can see it the now we see that there is some and we know how it was made. So I think it's so it's important to um, be humble when you're talking about science and you're not saying this is the way that it is. I mean, you own it sense, but you know, it's not, it's not able to answer ultimate questions at the moment is not able to answer even whether the universe had a beginning or not.

Speaker 1:          03:38          We don't even know that. And I gave it salt to, um, I was asked to give a talk to some bishops in the UK about cosmology and I said, yeah, that'd be great fun. And so I went and gave him this talk and, and at the end I said, I've got some questions. So if the universe is eternal and it might be, it might not have had a beginning. If it's eternal, what place is there for a creator? You know, that's, that's a good question, right? They didn't, they didn't have an answer cost, right. And Eternal Creator. But yet, but I think that these, it might be eternal and we might discover that. So we don't really know at the moment, but we might. So I think my point is that these other human uh, designed to be very natural to religions and natural thing, right?

Speaker 1:          04:26          People you say, oh, across the world in all different cultures, but I think that in the 21st century, it, religion needs to operate within that framework. If it's going, if it's going to operate, there are still great mysteries and it is appropriate to think about what it means to be human and are giving you my view of what it means. But, but he, I don't think the problem comes when you, when your, your theology or your philosophy forces you to deny some facts, some measurement. Now these things are measurements. We were not saying, it's not my opinion. The Universe is 13.8 billion years old. We measured it. It's like having an opinion between the distance from La to New York. Then you can't have an opinion on that. You know what it is. And it's the same, you know, slightly know that the things you notice is the people say the earth's flat or whatever that is. So it isn't, we've measured it, so it's just stop it, you know? So, but that doesn't mean you can't be spiritual and you can't be really just, I would saying it doesn't mean you can't believe in God or gods are a day that's not ruled out.
