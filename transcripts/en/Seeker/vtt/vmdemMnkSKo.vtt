00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:01.980
Never lie to an x-ray technician.

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:04.130
They can see right through you.

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:09.220
Hey everyone, Julia here for Dnews.

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:15.010
Most of us have gotten an x-ray at some point.

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:16.970
At the dentist or when we break a bone.

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.700
But I always had to wear an uncomfortable
heavy lead apron.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.440
So that makes me wonder… are they safe?

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.560
And how the hell can they see through me?

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.539
X-rays are just another form of electromagnetic
energy which is a long spectrum.

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:31.450
Visible light, what we can see, just makes
a tiny part of it.

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:34.570
On one end are radio waves on the other gamma
rays.

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.120
X-rays has waves that have a higher energy
and are a little longer than gamma rays but

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.730
a little shorter than visible light.

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.030
We can’t see ‘em but they can sure see
through us.

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.750
They were discovered in 1895 when a German
scientist was experimenting with passing electrical

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.530
currents through gas in tubes.

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.360
These tend to light up when hit with electrons,
so Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen, covered one of

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:53.520
his tubes up with a box.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.470
but he noticed something strange, an object
nearby glowed.

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:00.020
He assumed that some type of energy was getting
through the box.

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:05.329
But he didn’t know what kind of energy so
he called it x.

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:08.640
He found that it passed easily through some
objects, like our soft tissues.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.670
But not through others like our bones or especially
lead.

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.939
He produced the first image of an x-ray by
taking a radiograph of his wife’s hand in

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:16.939
1895.

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:18.909
It was heralded as a medical miracle.

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:20.829
Suddenly the new technology took off.

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:24.579
Everyone was using it to find breaks in bones
or bullets lodged in bodies.

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:27.110
But soon people noticed some problems.

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.369
Early x-ray techs started have skin problems
on their hands.

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:34.649
The skin would be dry and scaly, or they’d
get burns and their hair would fall out.

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:38.679
After a while, the damage would be so severe
they’d have to amputate fingers, hands,

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:39.889
sometimes whole arms.

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:41.820
Dozens of people died from radiation exposure.

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.100
But no one really seemed to take heed.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:50.619
People used x-rays for removing unwanted facial
hair or for shoe fittings.

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:52.539
Not surprisingly people got sick.

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:57.130
Women who got x-ray treatment to remove hair
wound up with dry, scaly, skin, enlarged blood

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.469
vessels, and finally developing a skin cancer.

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:00.889
But is it safe now?

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:03.630
Well we certainly learned our lesson from
those early days!

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.340
They’re still considered a carcinogen by
the World Health Organization.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.439
And one study published in the journal Cancer
found a link for a slight increased risk for

00:02:11.439 --> 00:02:14.620
certain brain cancers and frequent dental
x-rays.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.730
Another study published in the journal Lancet
found an up to 6% risk of cancer from diagnostic

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:20.730
x-rays.

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:21.890
But we’ve come along way.

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.560
Medical x-rays in the 50s used almost 100x
the radiation now considered acceptable.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.930
Basically the amount of radiation during an
x-ray is pretty small.

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.150
According to the FDA, an x-ray of your bones
in your hands or feet is pretty comparable

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.590
to a day’s worth of natural background radiation.

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.280
But other procedures have different levels
of exposure.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.750
There are enormous benefits to x-rays, the
pros by far outweigh the cons.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.709
They’re an incredible diagnostic tool.

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:50.330
They find bone breaks, blood clots, tumors,
and many many more things you really want

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.319
to know about without invasive exploratory
surgery.

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:57.190
But don’t be afraid to ask questions, make
sure it’s medically necessary and ask to

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.579
wear the protective shields, they’re like
a lead apron or neck guard.

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:04.510
Since radiation is cummulative over the course
of your life, keep track of your x-ray history

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.040
and make sure your medical professional knows.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.859
X-Rays help catch far more cases of cancer
than they cause.

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:14.359
Speaking of catching cancer, it seems South
Korea is over diagnosing cancer.

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:17.920
To find out why, check out this great video
from my buddy Evan over at Seeker Daily.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:31.810
And don’t forget to subscribe to that channel,
they’ve got great videos for the adventurer

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:32.989
in all of us.

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:44.349
Alright guys, got any questions about other
medical mysteries?
