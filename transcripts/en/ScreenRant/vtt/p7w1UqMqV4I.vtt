00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.190
Marvel is one of the most popular, lucrative
and successful media organisations on the

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:09.280
planet today.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:14.100
Its comics, movies, characters and merchandise
are some of the most read, watched, beloved

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.459
and purchased in the world.

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:19.070
You may think, therefore, that the company's
entire history is all sweetness and light

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:20.990
- but that's not actually the case.

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.570
Marvel has experienced many lows - just like
pretty much any other organisation tends to

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:25.570
have - and moments of darkness, controversy
and shame.

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.029
This video will run you through just a few
of them, so sit back, relax, and enjoy it

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.470
- but don't forget to sign up to our channel
to watch more like it in the future.

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:45.309
Here are ten shocking secrets Marvel would
not want anyone to know.

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:48.780
Their Movies Used To Be Awful
If you're still fairly young - or even if

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.540
you're not - you may not realise that Marvel
had been making feature-length movies long

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.850
before the MCU's inception and the current
crop of Marvel movies.

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:57.879
The problem is, they were absolutely awful.

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:02.710
A feature length Dr. Strange movie was made
in 1978 as a pilot for a proposed TV series

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.800
that didn't happen because the film was awful,
1986's Howard the Duck is one of the worst

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.590
comic book movies ever made, 1989's The Punisher
went direct-to-video, and a cheap and nasty

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.220
version of Captain America was released in
1990.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.000
Moreover, in 1994, a Fantastic Four movie
was made that was so bad, it wasn't even released

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.000
at all!

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:27.370
And there are a number of other horrendous
early Marvel movies too.

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:31.160
They Almost Made Some Even Worse Movies
Now, you may think that a movie featuring

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.080
a cheaply made Howard the Duck puppet was
as bad as it could get for Marvel - and you

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.950
might be right - but, on a number of occasions,
they very nearly ended up making movies that

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.270
had every chance of being even worse.

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.470
A few examples of Marvel movies that nearly
were include a She-Hulk movie starring Brigitte

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.670
Nielsen, a Silver Surfer musical scored by
Paul McCartney and featuring Olivia Newton

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.410
John in an important role, a Wolverine movie
starring Bob Hoskins, and a Spider-Man movie

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:59.680
in which Spidey would literally have been
a human/tarantula hybrid - seriously, they

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.330
really all almost happened.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.340
Can you imagine?!

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.580
They Steal Character Ideas From DC
Now, granted, this actually works both ways

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.660
- DC and Marvel have used each other's characters
to inspire their own on many occasions - but

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.530
Marvel are undoubtedly the worst offenders.

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.750
A few examples are as follows; Thanos was
influenced by Metron and Darkseid, Deadpool

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.750
was influenced by Deathstroke, Moon Knight
was influenced by Batman, the Nova Corps were

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.570
influenced by the Green Lantern Corps, Mister
Fantastic was influenced by Elongated Man,

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:30.660
Hawkeye was influenced by Green Arrow and
there are many, many more that we haven't

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.800
mentioned - we'd be on all day if we attempted
to mention them all!

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.090
They Treated Stan Lee And Jack Kirby Terribly
For A While

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.100
Stan Lee and the late Jack Kirby are undoubtedly
the two most important people in Marvel's

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.100
history.

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.350
Together, they created thes likes of Spider-Man,
Hulk, the X-Men, Captain America and the Fantastic

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.600
Four - but Marvel didn't always give them
the credit they deserved for it.

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.770
Marvel claimed that, because Lee and Kirby
created those characters while working as

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.350
their employees, they had no rights to them
- but the pair understandably wanted their

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.710
share of the profits when the characters became
popular.

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:02.590
Bitter legal battles ensued, lasting for years,
until Lee eventually worked something out

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.070
and is now heavily involved with Marvel to
this day.

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.840
Kirby died in 1994, however, so his situation
wasn't resolved so easily.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.960
His family fought Marvel for years without
a resolution, until 2014, when Marvel and

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.470
Kirbyâ€™s family reached an undisclosed settlement
and Marvel released a statement acknowledging

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:21.940
Kirby's huge contribution to the company throughout
his life.

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.640
The Avengers: Age Of Ultron Cast Threatened
To Quit

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.080
Marvel Studios' are known to have had unsettled
relationships with a number of their MCU cast

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.480
members - Edward Norton and Terrence Howard
were both replaced in the franchise after

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.090
disputes with the studio, while the likes
of Natalie Portman, Mickey Rourke and Hugo

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.760
Weaving are known to have not enjoyed some
of their experiences with them - but the more

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.410
established crop of actors almost had a falling
out with them too.

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.010
In fact, the production of 2015's Avengers:
Age of Ultron was actually in jeopardy when

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.190
the likes of Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson
and Chris Hemsworth threatened not to show

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.700
up for the movie unless the salaries they
were originally offered were dramatically

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:56.700
increased.

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.000
Of course, the increase did eventually occur
and the actors did appear in the movie, but

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.300
Marvel wouldn't want you to know what almost
happened.

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:09.130
Their Comics Used To Be Very Sexist
Some would argue, to this day, that Marvel

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:13.599
are somewhat sexist - given the distinct lack
of titular female superheroes to date in their

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:18.180
cinematic universe - but, back in the day,
some of their comic books were sexist in hugely

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.290
inappropriate ways.

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:23.460
There have been scenes in which The Thing
wanted to spank Sue Storm, Ant-Man used to

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:28.490
regularly domestically abuse The Wasp, some
of the female characters' costumes were shockingly

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:33.440
inappropriate, and, as recently as 2010, Marvel
launched a series of female-centric comics

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:38.880
called "Girl Comics" because, you know, girls
can't read comics unless they're totally feminine

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.460
(that last bit was sarcasm).

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:46.289
They've Published Some Truly Awful Titles
As we've previously mentioned, Marvel are

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:49.789
responsible for some of the most iconic comic
book titles in history - the likes of Spider-Man,

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:50.800
Hulk, the X-Men, Captain America and the Fantastic
Four, for example - but they've also published

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.620
some horrendous titles that they'd really
rather everyone forgot about.

00:04:54.620 --> 00:05:01.389
2005's romance comic Trouble, 1991's NFL Superpro
comic, a Billy Ray Cyrus comic, a comic starring

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:08.050
rap group Onyx and, of course, the infamous
swimsuit issues, are just some of the titles

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:09.606
Marvel would happily delete from their history
if they were given the opportunity to do so.

00:05:09.606 --> 00:05:14.370
They Turned Down The Option To Own DC
It's hard to imagine it now, but back in 1984,

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.389
the comic book industry was in trouble.

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:20.710
Sales were extremely low and absolutely nobody
wanted to see superheroes on the big screen.

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:24.529
Noting that Marvel were doing better than
DC, however, the head of Warner Communications'

00:05:24.529 --> 00:05:27.570
- Bill Sarnoff - approached Marvel about the
possibility of them purchasing the publishing

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:29.029
rights to DC Comics.

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:33.270
Editor-in-chief Jim Shooter declined the offer,
suggesting DC's characters just weren't very

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:34.629
good or interesting.

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:38.379
We bet that's a decision the company regrets
massively - even if they're not prepared to

00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:41.389
publicly admit it!

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:46.759
They Once Filed For Bankruptcy
Given that Marvel is now a media powerhouse,

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:50.130
you'd be forgiven for thinking they've ever
been in any serious financial trouble - even

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:51.270
during the aforementioned times when comic
book sales weren't great - but the fact is

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:52.740
they once filed for bankruptcy.

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:57.880
Between 1993 and 1996, stocks in the company
plummeted from more than $35 per share to

00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:59.460
a mere $2.

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:02.189
All Marvel could do in response was file for
bankruptcy.

00:06:02.189 --> 00:06:05.599
They were at the stage where they were selling
their own office equipment to gather funds

00:06:05.599 --> 00:06:09.330
but, thankfully for the company and its fans,
they merged with Toy Biz and turned their

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:13.379
attention to making the movies you know today,
which resulted in a major change in their

00:06:13.379 --> 00:06:14.379
fortunes.

00:06:14.379 --> 00:06:19.119
The rest, as they say, is history.

00:06:19.119 --> 00:06:22.960
Michael Jackson Tried To Buy Them
Back when the late Michael Jackson was throwing

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:27.970
money around for fun in the 1980s - he bought
the entire Beatles back catalog for Christ's

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:30.539
sake - he actually attempted to buy Marvel
Comics.

00:06:30.539 --> 00:06:34.470
The controversial King of Pop approached Stan
Lee for his help - and Lee was actually willing

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:38.330
- but the former Marvel president and chairman
wasn't in charge of the company at the time

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:39.809
and Jackson's bid failed.

00:06:39.809 --> 00:06:44.589
Moreover, Jackson wanted to play Spider-Man
in a Marvel movie and, rather crazily, lobbied

00:06:44.589 --> 00:06:53.280
extremely hard to play Charles Xavier in the
first X-Men movie in 2000!

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:57.169
