00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.455
The function we see over here on the left, is a line that is a slope of

00:00:03.455 --> 00:00:08.529
negative one half. And its y intercept is negative 4. So, it's equation is

00:00:08.529 --> 00:00:13.968
negative 1 half x minus 4. We can see that it starts here at x equals negative

00:00:13.968 --> 00:00:19.690
5, and it goes all the way over to the Y axis or the f of x axis. The next part

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:23.824
of the graph isn't a straight line however, it's a Parabola. That's pretty

00:00:23.824 --> 00:00:27.480
neat. And note that in order to use the notation we've been using for piecewise

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.756
functions, we have to rearrange the equation of each part of the function so

00:00:30.756 --> 00:00:36.088
that f of x is by itself on the left hand side. If we do that for this

00:00:36.088 --> 00:00:42.010
parabola, it's actually not too bad. It's just negative the quantity x minus 2

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:47.984
squared, since the vertex is at 2 comma 0. The graph is obeying this function

00:00:47.984 --> 00:00:53.006
from 0 to 3. The last line we have has a slip of 1, and it's equation is just f

00:00:53.006 --> 00:00:57.780
of x equals x minus 4. It's on the graph from 3 to 8.
