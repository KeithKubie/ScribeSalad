1
00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:06.140
So last time we were focusing on repeated interaction and that's what we're

2
00:00:06.151 --> 00:00:08.220
going to continue with today.

3
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.610
There's lots of things we could study under a piece of interaction,

4
00:00:11.611 --> 00:00:16.611
but the emphasis we're gonna have this week is can we achieve attain how many

5
00:00:16.801 --> 00:00:21.801
achieve cooperation in business or personal relationships without contracts by

6
00:00:23.311 --> 00:00:26.640
use of the fact that these relationships go on over time.

7
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.100
And our central intuition,

8
00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.270
where we've already started from last time was perhaps the future of a

9
00:00:33.271 --> 00:00:37.140
relationship can provide incentives for good behavior.

10
00:00:37.141 --> 00:00:40.710
Today I can put it intensities for people not to cheat.

11
00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.860
So specifically it's I think an example,

12
00:00:43.861 --> 00:00:45.720
and I'll go back to where we were last time,

13
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.590
specifically supposedly have a business relationship and ongoing business

14
00:00:49.591 --> 00:00:51.210
relationship with Jake.

15
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.040
And each period I'm supposed to supply Jake with some inputs for his business

16
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.330
that say some fruit.

17
00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.880
And each period he's supposed to ride me with them and put my business mainly

18
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.750
vegetables.
All right.

19
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.500
And clearly there are opportunities here in each period for us to cheat.

20
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.490
We could cheat both on the quality of the fruit that they provide or the

21
00:01:11.491 --> 00:01:13.950
quantity of the fruit that I provide to Jake.

22
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.600
And he can cheat on the quantity or quality of the vegetables that he provides

23
00:01:18.601 --> 00:01:20.550
to me right now.

24
00:01:20.551 --> 00:01:25.551
Central intuition is perhaps what can work is what can give us good incentives

25
00:01:26.311 --> 00:01:29.700
is the idea that if Jake cooperates today,

26
00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.620
then I might cooperate tomorrow.
I might not cheat tomorrow.
Can conversely,

27
00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.710
if he cheats and provides me with lousy vegetables today,

28
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.570
I'm going to provide him with lousy fruit tomorrow.
Right?
And similarly for me,

29
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.630
if I provide Jake with lousy fruit today,

30
00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.380
he can provide me with lousy vegetables tomorrow.
All right,

31
00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:50.671
so what do we need?

32
00:01:50.671 --> 00:01:55.671
We need the difference in the value of the promise of good behavior tomorrow and

33
00:01:56.701 --> 00:02:01.701
the threat of bad behavior tomorrow to outweigh the temptation to cheat today,

34
00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:03.360
right?

35
00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.590
It's cheap if I'm going to gain by providing him with the bad fruit or fewer

36
00:02:07.591 --> 00:02:11.370
fruit today,
bad fruit because cause there's,
I always have to throw away.

37
00:02:11.371 --> 00:02:16.170
So that temptation to cheat has to be outweighed by the promise of getting good

38
00:02:16.171 --> 00:02:20.550
vegetables.
In the future from Jake and vice versa.
All right,

39
00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.770
so here's the,
here's that idea on the board.
What we need is the gain,

40
00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.600
if I cheats today,

41
00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.030
to be outweighed by the difference between the value of my relationship with

42
00:02:33.031 --> 00:02:38.031
Jake after cooperating and the value of my relationship with Jake after cheating

43
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.450
tomorrow.
All right?

44
00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.270
And what we discovered last time there was,
this was an idea.
We kind of knew,

45
00:02:48.271 --> 00:02:49.680
we've got to known it since the first week,

46
00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.500
but we've some had lost time and somewhat surprisingly,

47
00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.480
that life is not quite simple.
So simple.
I in particular,
what we discovered was.
