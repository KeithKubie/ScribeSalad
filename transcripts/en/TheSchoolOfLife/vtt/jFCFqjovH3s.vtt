00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:02.940
What are universities really for?

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:06.540
Well, the main thing is to teach people how to make a living.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:11.040
Educating the young to be engineers, biochemists or economists.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.320
But there is another, stranger, bigger ambition, lurking away  there somewhere in the background.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.500
And it sometimes comes out during Commencement addresses, or

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.160
at the lyrical moments of graduation ceremonies.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.680
And that's the idea,

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.200
that universities might teach us how to live.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:32.340
That is, that these might be places to go and study in order to work out what really matters

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.620
Who we are, where our societies should be headed, and how we can be happier and more fulfilled

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.580
Not coincidentally, a great many universities were founded in the mid 19th century.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.120
At exactly the time

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.940
when belief in religion was undergoing a severe, and in the eyes of many, alarming decline.

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.320
At that time, a lot of questions were asked

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.060
about where people were going to go and find meaning, consolation, wisdom and a sense of community

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.780
All the things they once found in a church.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.940
And to certain educationalists there was one answer above all others.

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.500
What people had once found in churches, they would now be able to discover in things like

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.000
the dialogues of Plato, the plays of Shakespeare, the novels of Jane Austen,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.020
The paintings of Botticelli or Titian.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.780
In other words, in a secularizing age, culture would replace scripture.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.120
That's a beautiful, moving idea.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.780
And it's been responsible, for the construction of so many universities,

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.320
as well as museums, concert halls and libraries.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.520
But there is a problem.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.060
Picture up at any actual university, more or less anywhere in the world,

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.340
and start asking big questions, like,

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.220
where should I go with my life? Where is meaning to be found?

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.440
How can we change things in this troubled world?

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.360
And the stunned teaching staff will either call for the police or an insane asylum.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.820
It's just not what you're allowed to ask.

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.640
The really big questions, and inner dramas that people used to take to religion

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.120
seem strangely out of place in the average university setting.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:03.940
Where the mood is far cooler, more abstract and oddly removed from anything too practical or urgent.

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.540
Big questions that many students in the humanities have, like

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.660
how can I learn about relationships? What should I do with my life?

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.160
How can I reconcile my demand for money with my requirement for meaning?

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.120
How does power work out there in the world?

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.860
Such questions aren't necessarily very well addressed or answered.

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.480
Currently, universities have departments named after big academic disciplines, like

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.060
history, or literature, or philosophy.

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.460
But such titles really just reflect pretty arcane priorities

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:34.520
rather than accurately picking up on issues that actually trouble people in their lives.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:40.820
In the ideal university of the future, that original dream, that culture could replace scripture,

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.660
would be taking so seriously that departments would be reorganized

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.560
to reflect the actual prioritiesof our lives.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.460
So, for example, there might be a department for relationships, and another for death.

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.820
A center for anxiety and an academy for career self-knowledge.

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.660
You wouldn't study 18th century history or the picaresque novel.

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.380
You'd study how to be less anxious, or how to be more compassionate.

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.720
Complaining about how many universities are today

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:13.140
isn't a way of giving up on them, it's an attempt to get them to live up to their original promise,

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.800
which is, in a busy world, where most of us are just scrabbling around full-time trying to make a living,

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:25.700
to act as centers which can generate those ideas that we'll truly help us to live and to die well.
