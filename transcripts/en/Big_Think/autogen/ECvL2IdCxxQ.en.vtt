inner team and then there's a moment
 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.180
inner team and then there's a moment
where you bring actors into that process

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190
where you bring actors into that process
 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.670

and vibration the other thing about
 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:26.020
and vibration the other thing about
audience is

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030
audience is
 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:30.129
audience is
I always like to think about the

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:30.139
I always like to think about the
 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:34.480
I always like to think about the
audience as a creative partner and what

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490
audience as a creative partner and what
 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.210
audience as a creative partner and what
I mean by that is that the audience can

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220
I mean by that is that the audience can
 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.909
I mean by that is that the audience can
meet you more than halfway and they can

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:39.919
meet you more than halfway and they can
 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:43.540
meet you more than halfway and they can
help fulfill the moment so you actually

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:43.550
help fulfill the moment so you actually
 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:48.400
help fulfill the moment so you actually
don't have to micromanage and deliver

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:48.410
don't have to micromanage and deliver
 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:51.220
don't have to micromanage and deliver
everything actually the space that you

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:51.230
everything actually the space that you
 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:53.620
everything actually the space that you
leave for the audience to tap their

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:53.630
leave for the audience to tap their
 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:57.040
leave for the audience to tap their
imagination to complete something to

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.050
imagination to complete something to
 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.920
imagination to complete something to
bring themselves is as important as what

00:04:59.920 --> 00:04:59.930
bring themselves is as important as what
 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:02.440
bring themselves is as important as what
you provide for an audience and I think

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:02.450
you provide for an audience and I think
 

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:04.659
you provide for an audience and I think
that's also really important

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:04.669
that's also really important
 

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:08.650
that's also really important

with an idea and I know that together we
will make a third idea that is better

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:12.200
will make a third idea that is better
 

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:15.130

the whole process is finding the answer

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:50.950
the whole process is finding the answer
 

00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:52.380
the whole process is finding the answer
together if you have the answer you have

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:52.390
together if you have the answer you have
 

00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:55.020

not asked a big enough question you know
 

00:07:57.250 --> 00:07:59.190
not asked a big enough question you know
the idea is together we're gonna find

00:07:59.190 --> 00:07:59.200
the idea is together we're gonna find
 

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:00.840
the idea is together we're gonna find
out how we get to the top of the

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:00.850

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:02.250
out how we get to the top of the
mountain I don't know how we're gonna

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:02.260
mountain I don't know how we're gonna
 

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:03.600
mountain I don't know how we're gonna
get there but I know that's what we're

many cases you improve because you get
feedback and you get feedback from a

00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:35.360
feedback and you get feedback from a

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:39.910

people who said things to me at a RT

00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:39.920
people who said things to me at a RT

that's stuck with me and for many

00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:43.670
that's stuck with me and for many
 

00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:46.870
that's stuck with me and for many
reasons the actual change we made years

00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:46.880
reasons the actual change we made years
 

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:49.900

later couldn't happen but now they've

00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:49.910
