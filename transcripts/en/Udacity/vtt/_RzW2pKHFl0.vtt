00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.290
I'm Jennie Kim. I'm of Korean descent. And I experience alcohol flush reaction.

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.420
&gt;&gt; Well, for those of us, like me, who have not

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:10.930
experienced the alcohol flush reaction. Can you describe it for us?

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:13.510
&gt;&gt; Basically, I get really warm. And

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:15.370
I turn bright red whenever I drink alcohol.

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:19.799
&gt;&gt; I see. do you. Is it associated with any feelings of being sick?

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:25.440
I get a little bit queasy. I don't tolerate alcohol very well. And I

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.610
really can't drink more than a couple of drinks at a time.

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:30.350
&gt;&gt; I see, so your tolerance then is maybe a little

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:33.650
bit lower than other people of your same height and size.

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:34.490
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.110
&gt;&gt; Now is this something that's common in your family?

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.680
&gt;&gt; It is. my dad also experienced alcohol flush

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.410
reaction, and he. Really doesn't drink, as a result.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.770
&gt;&gt; Now, when did you first realize that you had this kind of alcohol flush?

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.080
&gt;&gt; It's kind of a funny story. my mom was

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.560
looking through my Facebook party pictures, back when I was

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.310
in college. And one day, she just sort of asked,

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:57.900
she was looking through them. Looked up at me and

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.190
said, why are you so sunburned in all your pictures?

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:01.190
&gt;&gt;

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:00.251
[LAUGH].

00:01:00.251 --> 00:01:03.990
&gt;&gt; And that's when I realized something was up. Yeah. My mom

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:05.990
didn't, didn't understand. Because she herself

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:07.590
does not have alcohol flush reaction.

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.750
&gt;&gt; I see. Now, does this mean that you have any personal

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.360
genetic information about your, yourself or

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.250
your family for this particular trait?

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.270
&gt;&gt; Yes. We've all We've all used 23andMe.

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:20.930
&gt;&gt; You have, and what was your

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.580
report for the ALDH2, the aldahyde dehydrogenase enzyme.

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:25.460
&gt;&gt; If I can

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.580
remember correctly my father and I only have one working copy of that gene.

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.190
&gt;&gt; I see. So you're heterozygous?

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.462
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:01:31.462 --> 00:01:35.940
&gt;&gt; So, wow that means you, well we don't know

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.340
who you inherited it from unless we know, is your

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.000
mom. You said you mom does not have this? I

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.430
see, so you know that you inherited this from your dad.

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:44.470
&gt;&gt; Definitely from my dad, yeah.

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:45.670
&gt;&gt; Wow. How does that make you feel?

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:46.810
&gt;&gt; I don't know, just

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:47.810
&gt;&gt;

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:47.600
[LAUGH]

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.062
&gt;&gt; Empathetic I guess, for my dad.

00:01:50.062 --> 00:01:50.098
[LAUGH]

00:01:50.098 --> 00:01:51.098
&gt;&gt;

00:01:50.098 --> 00:01:50.620
[LAUGH]

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.050
do you consider this I guess a good or a

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.930
bad trait at all? Or a positive or a negative thing?

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:57.510
&gt;&gt; Well it's funny that you ask that, you know?

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.740
I think if you'd asked me this in col, back

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.000
in college, I would have said it's definitely a negative

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.120
thing. I wish I didn't have it Then I could, you

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.270
know, have champagne all the time and it would be

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.930
awesome. But now I'm actually pretty grateful for it. First

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:11.980
of all, it's good I think that it helps me

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.730
be more aware of the impact alcohol has on my body.

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:15.211
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:02:15.211 --> 00:02:15.730
&gt;&gt; Which is

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.220
generally a good thing for my health and well-being. and second

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.350
I actually kind of like, or at least appreciate strangely enough

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:28.390
how that this reaction is somewhat socially embarrassing and awkward. I

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.120
actually appreciate feeling bad about myself

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.700
sometimes. Because that's why I'm funny.

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.650
&gt;&gt; And you raise an interesting point

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.600
there. You know, as someone who experiences

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.620
alcohol flush reaction. And let's say someone

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.880
watching this class maybe is only just discovering

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.300
this for themselves. Is it an embarrassing feeling or do

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.700
like people ever like, make fun of you for it or?

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:51.000
&gt;&gt; Well you know I think

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.220
back when I started noticing it, I was

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.100
much more self-conscious. I like to think though

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.930
that really that people are too self-involved to

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.940
really notice other people. At least I am.

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:01.940
&gt;&gt;

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:01.343
[LAUGH]

00:03:01.343 --> 00:03:04.930
&gt;&gt; So I, you know, I, I've become a lot more

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.740
comfortable with that. And I also just don't care as much.

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.840
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so obviously the disadvantages of

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.060
alcohol flush reaction are that you can feel

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.840
kind of bad, you don't have that high of a tolerance, and there may be some

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.340
kind of awkward social stuff occasionally. Are

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.170
there any advantages besides the ones you mentioned

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.360
about, you know being more self-aware about yourself,

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.400
is there any kind of other advantage to?

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.640
&gt;&gt; I actually like the fact that it moderates. It forces me to moderate

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.330
my drinking. And be pretty judicious about

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.090
drinking. I always have to ask myself, like,

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.930
is this cocktail really worth it? I have a saying that I can either be

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.830
drinking or I can be cute. But I can't be both at the same time.

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:41.830
&gt;&gt;

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:41.373
[LAUGH]

00:03:41.373 --> 00:03:44.300
&gt;&gt; So I'll often just choose to be cute. And you know just

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.500
choose not to participate in alcohol at all. and as I'm getting older,

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.020
I kind of appreciate that more to have that choice. And I feel

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:54.880
better, you know, in the mornings than maybe some of my other friends would.

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.700
&gt;&gt; What about any kind of medication?

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.170
You know, for lactose intolerance and people who

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.680
actually, whose bodies don't metabolize lactose very

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.840
easily, they can actually take a bio-active form.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.110
Of lactase, which allows them to digest dairy products. Is there

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:13.650
anything like that for alcohol flush reaction that you know of?

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:19.950
&gt;&gt; There's kind of this over the counter remedy that a lot of my Asian peers

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:21.890
and I have discovered. It's just an over

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:24.180
the counter antacid or acid reducing pill which

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.370
I used to call the anti-Asian pill. and I used to take that when I drank.

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.110
But, later I found out that research shows

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.090
that it actually isn't good for you to suppress

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:37.930
your bodies symptoms as it processes this toxin. so I stopped taking it.
