00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.379
More and more, Hollywood studios are confident
enough in a film's ability to launch a franchise

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:15.680
that they'll start planning for sequels even
before viewers have seen the movie.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.860
However, if the film doesn't perform as well
as expected at the box office, or is panned

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.220
by critics and viewers alike, studios are
forced to change those plans.

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.180
In these cases, sequels may be entirely abandoned,
leaving audiences to wonder what could have

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:29.180
been.

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.980
Here are Screen Rant's 10 movie sequels you
will never see.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:32.980
Green Lantern

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.920
Ryan Reynolds may have found the perfect superhero
role in Deadpool, but comic book fans will

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.070
never forget the disappointment of his turn
as the DC hero Green Lantern.

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.160
Warner Bros. gave director Martin Campbell
a $200 million budget hoping to launch a DC

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.470
Comics franchise rivalling Marvel's burgeoning
cinematic universe.

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.120
However, when the movie barely turned a profit
and disappointed both comic book fans and

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.640
casual audiences, Warner Bros. scrapped plans
for the sequel.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.790
Although we'll never see a Green Lantern sequel
starring Reynolds, the studio has planned

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.840
a new take on the superhero as part of the
DC Extended Universe.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:02.930
Battlefield Earth

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.040
Based on Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard's
book of the same name, this John Travolta

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.830
pet project only covered the first half of
the source material; the filmmakers planned

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.960
to tackle the second half of the novel in
a sequel.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.040
But, those plans were cancelled when Battlefield
Earth bombed at the box office, resulting

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.590
in a $40 million loss for producers - including
Travolta who starred in the film and used

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.800
his own money to partially fund its production.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.490
Because of its box office failure and all-around
poor movie-going experience, Battlefield Earth

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:35.400
has earned a reputation as one of the worst
movies in film history.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.900
Superman Returns

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.420
Before DC Comics' famous superhero received
the reboot treatment with Zack Snyder's Man

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.990
of Steel, director Bryan Singer and star Brandon
Routh brought the Man of Tomorrow to life

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.330
in Superman Returns.

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.740
However, the film received criticism for focusing
too much on the emotional side of the character

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.830
without giving Superman enough action sequences
of him taking on bad guys.

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.310
As a result, Warner Bros. pulled the plug
on a second film helmed by Singer.

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.659
The director has since talked about his plans
for the sequel, which included the villain

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.390
Darkseid and the movie being titled The Man
of Steel.

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.900
But, with Henry Cavill playing the superhero
in the DC Extended Universe, this is one superhero

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.280
sequel we won't ever see.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.760
The Golden Compass

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.690
Based on the first book in Philip Pullman's
His Dark Materials trilogy, The Golden Compass

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.209
was set up to be the next massively popular
young adult fantasy series, like a cross between

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:23.049
Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, and The Chronicles
of Narnia.

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:26.799
However, because the movie underperformed
at the North American box office and the film's

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:31.010
overseas rights were sold by New Line Cinema,
the studio didn't make as much money as expected

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.379
on The Golden Compass's $180 million budget.

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:37.840
As a result, they cancelled plans to adapt
the second book in the series, The Subtle

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:38.840
Knife.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.420
Though fans won't ever see a sequel to The
Golden Compass, BBC is reportedly developing

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.819
a television series based on His Dark Materials.

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:48.709
Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:53.469
Although 2005's Fantastic Four was a goofy
take on Marvel's first family, the film performed

00:02:53.469 --> 00:02:55.650
well enough at the box office to earn a sequel.

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.709
However, the same can't be said for Fantastic
Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer, which didn't

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:01.129
earn as much as the first movie.

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:05.090
So, although the actors behind the titular
superhero team had signed three-picture deals

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.760
and many of the filmmakers were prepared to
return, Fox pulled the plug on a third instalment

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.930
in the series.

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:17.400
Instead, the movie studio rebooted the Fantastic
Four in 2015 - to disastrous results.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.629
Fantastic Four

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:22.760
After the underperformance of Fantastic Four:
Rise of the Silver Surfer, Fox brought in

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.480
director Josh Trank to reboot Marvel's first
family with a younger cast and a darker, more

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:28.480
grounded tone.

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.949
However, disputes between Trank and Fox arose
during production, leading to reshoots for

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:35.069
Fantastic Four that overhauled the entire
second half of the film.

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:39.180
The movie became the worst reviewed Marvel
movie to date and even Trank publicly condemned

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.180
the final cut.

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.109
Following the overwhelmingly negative response
to Fantastic Four, Fox pulled the planned

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:48.230
sequel from their release schedule, effectively
canceling the second instalment in this rebooted

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:49.870
franchise.

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:50.870
Dredd

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:55.379
Following comic character Judge Dredd, played
by Karl Urban, this sci-fi action film was

00:03:55.379 --> 00:04:00.049
a box office failure despite a generally positive
critical response to the movie's exciting

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:01.049
action beats.

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:05.279
Dredd has since earned cult film status because
of its dedicated and vocal fans base, which

00:04:05.279 --> 00:04:07.519
have been calling for a sequel for many years.

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:12.579
According to Urban and producer Adi Shankar,
talks of Dredd 2 did happen around 2014, but

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:16.829
the film's screenwriter Alex Garland has since
urged fans to give up hope on a second instalment

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:19.440
- even if Dredd does deserve that sequel.

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:20.940
The Amazing Spider-Man 2

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.730
Prior to its release, Sony Pictures had scheduled
two more films in its Amazing Spider-Man series

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:27.770
with Andrew Garfield as the titular hero.

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.540
The Amazing Spider-Man 2 was meant to establish
a cinematic universe that would rival Marvel

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.230
Studios - with Sony planning to include Sinister
Six and Venom spinoffs.

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:39.080
However, The Amazing Spider-Man 2's mixed
critical response and underperformance at

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.880
the box office led the studio to rethink their
plans.

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.880
The bad situation was exacerbated by the 2014
Sony Pictures Entertainment hack, which saw

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.180
leaked emails of negotiations with Marvel
to have Spider-Man return home.

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:54.580
A few months later, Sony and Marvel's partnership
on a rebooted Spider-Man franchise was officially

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.380
announced, with Tom Holland later revealed
to play the web-slinger in Captain America:

00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:59.380
Civil War.

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:04.000
This move effectively canceled plans for any
sequel to The Amazing Spider-Man 2.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.070
Batman &amp; Robin

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:08.820
Following the success of Tim Burton's two
Batman films, director Joel Schumacher stepped

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:11.850
in for Batman Forever and its sequel, Batman
&amp; Robin.

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:15.630
During the production of Batman &amp; Robin, Warner
Bros. gave the green light for another instalment

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:18.440
in the series that would see Schumacher return
as director.

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:22.250
Titled Batman Triumphant, George Clooney,
Chris O'Donnell and Alicia Silverstone were

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:26.170
set to reprise their roles as Batman, Robin,
and Batgirl respectively.

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:30.360
Plus, reportedly, Schumacher had also approached
Nicolas Cage to play Batman villain Scarecrow.

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:34.070
However, due to the negative critic and fan
response to Batman &amp; Robin, as well as its

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:38.460
underperformance at the box office, Warner
Bros. cancelled Batman Triumphant.

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:43.000
The Dark Knight wouldn't be seen on the big
screen again until Christopher Nolan's Batman

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.000
Begins.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.940
The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:50.490
After the success of other young adult novels
adapted to blockbuster franchises like The

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:54.620
Hunger Games, Constantin Films brought the
first book in Cassandra Clare's Mortal Instruments

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:55.650
series to life.

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:59.140
A few months before the movie hit theaters,
the production company announced a film based

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:03.810
on the second book City of Ashes, would begin
production in September 2013 - only a month

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:05.900
after City of Bones was to be released.

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:09.590
Although the film opened below expectations,
Constantin remained confident it would warrant

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:12.510
a sequel because of increasing book and soundtrack
sales.

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:16.610
But, when City of Bones continued to underperform
at the box office, production on City of Ashes

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:17.650
was delayed.

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:21.460
Any remaining hope that the sequel would be
made at all was officially squashed when Constantin

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:25.150
announced they would be moving forward with
a new television adaptation called Shadowhunters

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:27.220
that has since premiered on Freeform.

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:28.220
