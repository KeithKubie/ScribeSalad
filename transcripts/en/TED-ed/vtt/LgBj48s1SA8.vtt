00:00:06.364 --> 00:00:08.814
A rabbit attempts to play a church organ,

00:00:08.814 --> 00:00:11.441
while a knight fights a giant snail

00:00:11.441 --> 00:00:15.374
and a naked man blows a trumpet 
with his rear end.

00:00:15.374 --> 00:00:18.997
Painted with squirrel-hair brushes 
on vellum or parchment

00:00:18.997 --> 00:00:22.134
by monks, nuns, and urban craftspeople,

00:00:22.134 --> 00:00:26.574
these bizarre images populate the 
margins of the most prized books

00:00:26.574 --> 00:00:28.596
from the Middle Ages.

00:00:28.596 --> 00:00:34.539
Their illustrations often tell a second 
story as rich as the text itself.

00:00:34.539 --> 00:00:38.245
Some images appear in many 
different illuminated manuscripts,

00:00:38.245 --> 00:00:42.450
and often reinforce the religious 
content of the books they decorated.

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.500
For example, a porcupine picking 
up fruit on its spines

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.030
could represent the devil stealing 
the fruits of faith--

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.677
or Christ taking up the sins of mankind.

00:00:53.677 --> 00:00:57.867
Medieval lore stated that a hunter 
could only capture a unicorn

00:00:57.867 --> 00:01:00.872
when it lay its horn in 
the lap of a virgin,

00:01:00.872 --> 00:01:04.542
so a unicorn could symbolize 
either sexual temptation

00:01:04.542 --> 00:01:07.523
or Christ being captured by his enemies.

00:01:07.523 --> 00:01:11.728
Rabbits, meanwhile, could represent 
human’s lustful natures—

00:01:11.728 --> 00:01:15.328
and could redeem themselves through 
attempts to make sacred music

00:01:15.328 --> 00:01:17.594
despite their failings.

00:01:17.594 --> 00:01:21.394
All of these references would have 
been familiar to medieval Europeans

00:01:21.394 --> 00:01:24.059
from other art forms and oral tradition,

00:01:24.059 --> 00:01:27.809
though some have grown more 
mysterious over the centuries.

00:01:27.809 --> 00:01:28.630
Today,

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:34.312
no one can say for sure what the common 
motif of a knight fighting a snail means—

00:01:34.312 --> 00:01:38.023
or why the knight so often 
appears to be losing.

00:01:38.023 --> 00:01:41.450
The snail might be a symbol of the 
inevitability of death,

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.171
which defeats even the strongest knights.

00:01:44.171 --> 00:01:50.337
Or it could represent humility, and a 
knight’s need to vanquish his own pride.

00:01:50.337 --> 00:01:54.710
Many illuminated manuscripts were 
copies of religious or classical texts,

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:00.147
and the bookmakers incorporated their 
own ideas and opinions in illustrations.

00:02:00.147 --> 00:02:02.300
The butt tuba, for example,

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.373
was likely shorthand to 
express disapproval with--

00:02:05.373 --> 00:02:10.088
or add an ironic spin to--
the action in the text.

00:02:10.088 --> 00:02:14.038
Illuminations could also be used to 
make subversive political commentary.

00:02:14.038 --> 00:02:16.441
The text of the "Smithfield Decretals"

00:02:16.441 --> 00:02:20.320
details the Church’s laws and 
punishments for lawbreakers.

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.554
But the margins show a fox being 
hanged by geese,

00:02:23.554 --> 00:02:28.814
a possible allusion to the common people 
turning on their powerful oppressors.

00:02:28.814 --> 00:02:30.926
In the "Chronica Majora,"

00:02:30.926 --> 00:02:34.213
Matthew Paris summarized a 
scandal of his day,

00:02:34.213 --> 00:02:36.453
in which the Welsh prince Griffin

00:02:36.453 --> 00:02:39.831
plummeted to his death 
from the tower of London.

00:02:39.831 --> 00:02:42.622
Some believed the prince fell, 
Paris wrote,

00:02:42.622 --> 00:02:45.032
while others thought he was pushed.

00:02:45.032 --> 00:02:47.229
He added his own take in the margins,

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:49.517
which show the prince falling to his death

00:02:49.517 --> 00:02:53.297
while trying to escape on a rope 
made of bed-sheets.

00:02:53.297 --> 00:02:57.013
Some margins told stories of 
a more personal nature.

00:02:57.013 --> 00:02:58.495
"The Luttrell Psalter,"

00:02:58.495 --> 00:03:02.553
a book of psalms and prayers commissioned 
by Sir Geoffrey Luttrell,

00:03:02.553 --> 00:03:04.920
shows a young woman having her hair done,

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.921
while a young man catches a bird in a net.

00:03:07.921 --> 00:03:10.838
The shaved patch on his 
head is growing out,

00:03:10.838 --> 00:03:15.082
indicating that he is a clergyman 
neglecting his duties.

00:03:15.082 --> 00:03:17.030
This alludes to a family scandal

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.350
where a young cleric ran away with Sir 
Geoffrey’s daughter Elizabeth.

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.883
The family’s personal spiritual advisor 
likely painted it into the book

00:03:25.883 --> 00:03:28.353
to remind his clients of their failings

00:03:28.353 --> 00:03:31.600
and encourage their spiritual development.

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.297
Some artists even painted themselves 
into the manuscripts.

00:03:35.297 --> 00:03:39.420
The opening image of Christine de 
Pisan’s collected works

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.439
shows de Pisan presenting 
the book to the Queen of France.

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:46.809
The queen was so impressed by de Pisan's 
previous work

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:49.186
that she commissioned her own copy.

00:03:49.186 --> 00:03:50.706
Such royal patronage

00:03:50.706 --> 00:03:55.046
enabled her to establish her own 
publishing house in Paris.

00:03:55.046 --> 00:04:00.006
The tradition of illuminated manuscripts 
lasted for over a thousand years.

00:04:00.006 --> 00:04:05.390
The books were created by individuals or 
teams for uses as wide-ranging

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:10.185
as private prayer aids, service books 
in churches, textbooks,

00:04:10.185 --> 00:04:13.889
and protective talismans to 
take into battle.

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:15.877
Across all this variation,

00:04:15.877 --> 00:04:18.111
those tricky little drawings 
in the margins

00:04:18.111 --> 00:04:22.121
are a unique window into the 
minds of medieval artists.
