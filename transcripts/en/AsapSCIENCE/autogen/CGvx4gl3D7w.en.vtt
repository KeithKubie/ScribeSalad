00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.230
 Whether as the first day of school, an important interview or the day of your wedding - pimples 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:10.410
 You'll find a way to appear at the most inconvenient times. But why show and how we can 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:11.559
 Get rid of her? 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:15.620
 The term "pore" is just another term for "hair follicles" and your body 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:20.199
 And covered by. There is a gland inside the follicle produces an oil called 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:25.259
 Sebum, which secrete on the skin to maintain the moisture of hair and body. But if they become 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:30.960
 Hair follicles are resistant to dead skin cells and oils, causing clogging. Sebum 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.770
 The production will continue but is trapped inside the pores, making it swell. 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.670
 This is where the bacteria come to play, feeding on dead skin and sebum which can 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.840
 Unfortunately lead to infection. Your immune system responds by sending blood to the area 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.460
 Which gives the appearance of redness and inflammation, and a lot of white blood cells come to the area also, 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.680
 To remove the infection. When white blood cells die, they meet with 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.770
 Dead skin and sebum, showing a pimple filled with pus. 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.300
 If a subcutaneous occlusion occurs, a white pimple, known as "whiteheads", will be made 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.329
 If a clot occurs above the skin and discoloration of the black is known as "blackheads". 

00:01:07.329 --> 00:01:11.990
 This is the result of melanin in dead skin cells interacting with oxygen creating a black color 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.649
 It is not dirty. 

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:18.399
 We get most pimples when we are teenagers because of the increased amount of androgen hormones 

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:23.079
 Such as testosterone in our bodies at the onset of puberty. Testosterone increases production 

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:28.969
 Sebum doubles, which increases the rate of blockages. But grains can appear at any time 

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:34.149
 - often - result from stressful events. "Cortisol" stress hormone, increases the amount 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:39.270
 Inflammation in your body (which means more red spikes on your face), can also suppress your immune system 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.469
 This means that your body can not fight bacteria that cause acne. 

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:48.600
 So how can we fight warts? For normal injuries clean your face to remove 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.450
 Excess oil and thus prevent clogging of pores and peeling from time to time to remove the dead skin 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.479
 Will help, although acne often can not be resolved this way. It is important to remember 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:03.590
 Hygiene and diet do not play a major role in acne, but in genetics 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:10.440
 Hormones. Many of the available drugs such as benzoyl peroxide kill a specific type of acne-causing bacteria 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.460
 Salicylic acid, which helps remove dead skin clots, retinoids, which reduce the production of sebum 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:20.670
 And a variety of other; although some drugs can have serious side effects. At 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.000
 Women, some success has been observed when using oral contraceptives, which reduce the production of ovaries 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.890
 Of the androgen hormones, thus reducing sebum. Of course, consult with 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.890
 A doctor about which system is best suited to you is always better 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.310
 But new treatments loom with the help of science! Study 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.550
 Individuals who do not have acne scientists have noticed that bacteria usually have 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:48.990
 Acne is also found on their skin, but of a different breed. It turned out that 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:54.400
 The same bacteria with little variation in genes cause healthier skin. With this in mind, 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.010
 Future treatments may include a deeper look at the level of bacteria, and whether it is 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.320
 Changing the germs of your skin can treat pimples. 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.930
 We are really happy to work with Bill and Melinda Gates in support 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.980
 Their annual message for the year as "two great powers we wish"! every year 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.060
 They launch a message to receive consideration of global issues, and the question this year is: how will it be 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.560
 Your precious superpower? You will have more clean energy such as Bill or for more time 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.840
 Like Melinda, this means one thing in rich countries and another thing for the world 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.230
 the poorest. It's a chance for positive change in the world - so I find something 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.840
 You are passionate about him and know more about him. Check the message on the link in Saduk 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:39.000
 Description, we will post the ideas of the supercomputers on Instagram with #superpowerforgood.
