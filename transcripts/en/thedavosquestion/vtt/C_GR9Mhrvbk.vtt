VIVIANE REDING &gt;&gt; Hi, YouTube. I am Viviane

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:09.929
Reding. I am from Luxembourg but I speak to
you as the member of the European government

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:18.180
who is responsible for technology, telecom's
and the media. And-ah-I think that we have

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:26.109
to change our way of tackling the energy crisis
and the global warming because we normally

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:32.280
look at those from the point of view that
it will cost a lot. I think it can bring us

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:39.160
a lot--not only in order to save the planet
but also for launching a new capacity for

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.440
innovative technologies and then of innovative
industries.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:52.030
So for me, climate change and energy scarcity
is a real chance for re-launching the economy.
