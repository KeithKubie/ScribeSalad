00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120
today we'll be talking about podcast
 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.140
today we'll be talking about podcast
creators and design tools now podcast

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150
creators and design tools now podcast
 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.330
creators and design tools now podcast
creators when we talk about podcast

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340
creators when we talk about podcast
 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.369
creators when we talk about podcast
creators we don't mean podcast listeners

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379
creators we don't mean podcast listeners
 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.279
creators we don't mean podcast listeners
which I believe the app clinic guys have

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289
which I believe the app clinic guys have
 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.410
which I believe the app clinic guys have
done before we're going to be talking

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420
done before we're going to be talking
 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.509
done before we're going to be talking
about podcast creation basically kind of

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519
about podcast creation basically kind of
 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.870
about podcast creation basically kind of
the process of recording I guess

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880
the process of recording I guess
 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.210
the process of recording I guess
creating recording managing and then

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220
creating recording managing and then
 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.519
creating recording managing and then
uploading your podcast to whatever you

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529
uploading your podcast to whatever you
 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.840
uploading your podcast to whatever you
know podcast host you use so with that

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850
know podcast host you use so with that
 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.459
know podcast host you use so with that
should we jump in okay okay so we talk

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469
should we jump in okay okay so we talk
 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:41.930
should we jump in okay okay so we talk
about podcast creation you're probably

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940
about podcast creation you're probably
 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.630
about podcast creation you're probably
thinking about a couple of different

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640
thinking about a couple of different
 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.490
thinking about a couple of different
different functions different I guess

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500
different functions different I guess
 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.700
different functions different I guess
basic behaviors that are podcast

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710
basic behaviors that are podcast
 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.889
basic behaviors that are podcast
creation apps should offer the first is

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899
creation apps should offer the first is
 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.860
creation apps should offer the first is
obviously to record audio the second is

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870
obviously to record audio the second is
 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.600
obviously to record audio the second is
probably to edit and fine-tune your

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610
probably to edit and fine-tune your
 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.040
probably to edit and fine-tune your
audio so like you know once you're done

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050
audio so like you know once you're done
 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.110
audio so like you know once you're done
creating or once you're done with a

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120
creating or once you're done with a
 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.510
creating or once you're done with a
recording going in and then trimming and

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520
recording going in and then trimming and
 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.219
recording going in and then trimming and
changing things and inserting effects

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229
changing things and inserting effects
 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.350
changing things and inserting effects
and muting things of that and then of

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360
and muting things of that and then of
 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.880
and muting things of that and then of
course management so you know just like

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890
course management so you know just like
 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.450
course management so you know just like
any sort of blog management app you

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460
any sort of blog management app you
 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.000
any sort of blog management app you
probably want some way to you know

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010
probably want some way to you know
 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.730
probably want some way to you know
publish items look at currently

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740
publish items look at currently
 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.130
publish items look at currently
published items have a draft mode for

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140
published items have a draft mode for
 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.530
published items have a draft mode for
certain things and so on and so forth

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540
certain things and so on and so forth
 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.210
certain things and so on and so forth
and then we also decided that you know

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220
and then we also decided that you know
 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.670
and then we also decided that you know
for podcast creation or I guess anything

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680
for podcast creation or I guess anything
 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.370
for podcast creation or I guess anything
that has like a thick mode you do have

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380
that has like a thick mode you do have
 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.990
that has like a thick mode you do have
two modes here you have the recording

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000
two modes here you have the recording
 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.580
two modes here you have the recording
mode like I'm currently capturing audio

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590
mode like I'm currently capturing audio
 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.770
mode like I'm currently capturing audio
and that's kind of like a something that

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780
and that's kind of like a something that
 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.330
and that's kind of like a something that
the user should be aware of almost like

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340
the user should be aware of almost like
 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.590
the user should be aware of almost like
playing music right if you're playing

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600
playing music right if you're playing
 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.420
playing music right if you're playing
music the user should be aware at all

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430
music the user should be aware at all
 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.310
music the user should be aware at all
times that music is playing and that's

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320
times that music is playing and that's
 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.420
times that music is playing and that's
why you know you see things like a

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430
why you know you see things like a
 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.190
why you know you see things like a
notification icon or if you're in the

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200
notification icon or if you're in the
 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.230
notification icon or if you're in the
app you you see kind of like a

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240
app you you see kind of like a
 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.480
app you you see kind of like a
persistent bar and then the other

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490
persistent bar and then the other
 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.899
persistent bar and then the other
obvious kind of very thick mode is or

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909
obvious kind of very thick mode is or
 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.880
obvious kind of very thick mode is or
lack thereof is just the idle state or

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890
lack thereof is just the idle state or
 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.080
lack thereof is just the idle state or
the pause state where you're not

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090
the pause state where you're not
 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.780
the pause state where you're not
recording anything so with these kind of

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790
recording anything so with these kind of
 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.499
recording anything so with these kind of
high-level functions you know we decided

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509
high-level functions you know we decided
 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.069
high-level functions you know we decided
to look then at actually i forgot to i

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079
to look then at actually i forgot to i
 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.270
to look then at actually i forgot to i
forget to mention we're not actually

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280
forget to mention we're not actually
 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.119
forget to mention we're not actually
going to redesign or reimagine any

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129
going to redesign or reimagine any
 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.770
going to redesign or reimagine any
existing apps we're just kind of going

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780
existing apps we're just kind of going
 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.640
existing apps we're just kind of going
to go through the process of designing

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650
to go through the process of designing
 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.399
to go through the process of designing
hypothetical podcast creation out so

00:02:14.399 --> 00:02:14.409
hypothetical podcast creation out so
 

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:15.630
hypothetical podcast creation out so
here's kind of the the first set of

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640
here's kind of the the first set of
 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.160
here's kind of the the first set of
things that we thought about so second

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170
things that we thought about so second
 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.390
things that we thought about so second

thing a set of things that we thought
 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.640
thing a set of things that we thought
about is the kind of the the underlying

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650
about is the kind of the the underlying
 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.530

functions right so for each of these

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540
functions right so for each of these
 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.100
functions right so for each of these
main themes for creating for edun for

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110
main themes for creating for edun for
 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.110

manage you want to have you know more

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120
manage you want to have you know more
 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.839
manage you want to have you know more
specific bits of functionality so for

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:30.849
specific bits of functionality so for
 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:33.149
specific bits of functionality so for
creation you probably want to have the

00:02:33.149 --> 00:02:33.159
creation you probably want to have the
 

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:34.770

actual recording you want to be able to
mute and unmute probably you know if

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140
mute and unmute probably you know if
 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:42.660
mute and unmute probably you know if
something comes up and you want to you

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670
something comes up and you want to you
 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.849
something comes up and you want to you
know silent insert of silence and then

know silent insert of silence and then
 

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:46.110
know silent insert of silence and then
you probably want to insert either live

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120
you probably want to insert either live
 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.059

drafts and maybe manage the draft
somehow so we roughly and this is a very

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220
somehow so we roughly and this is a very
 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.550
somehow so we roughly and this is a very
very basic podcast creation app that

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560
very basic podcast creation app that
 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.559
very basic podcast creation app that
we're thinking about we roughly kind of

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:34.569
we're thinking about we roughly kind of
 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:36.839
we're thinking about we roughly kind of
broke things out into these basic

00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:36.849
broke things out into these basic
 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:38.520
broke things out into these basic
functions and this kind of you know

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530
functions and this kind of you know
 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.349
functions and this kind of you know
doing this type of exercise kind of

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:40.359
doing this type of exercise kind of
 

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:43.890
doing this type of exercise kind of
helps scope out the app and it's a very

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900
helps scope out the app and it's a very
 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.119
helps scope out the app and it's a very
good idea to do something like this

00:03:45.119 --> 00:03:45.129
good idea to do something like this
 

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:47.640
good idea to do something like this
before jumping into the design or the

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650
before jumping into the design or the
 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.569
before jumping into the design or the
layout or anything like more detailed so

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:51.579
layout or anything like more detailed so
 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:54.300
layout or anything like more detailed so
with these you know high level functions

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310
with these you know high level functions
 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.129
with these you know high level functions
we then looked at you know just some

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:56.139
we then looked at you know just some
 

00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:58.589
we then looked at you know just some
basic explorations of layout right so

00:03:58.589 --> 00:03:58.599
basic explorations of layout right so
 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:01.409
basic explorations of layout right so
once you know what the app does you want

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:01.419
once you know what the app does you want
 

00:04:01.419 --> 00:04:02.759
once you know what the app does you want
to start thinking about you know what

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:02.769
to start thinking about you know what
 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:05.009
to start thinking about you know what
how it roughly looks like and how

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:05.019
how it roughly looks like and how
 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:07.259
how it roughly looks like and how
roughly behaves so you know we imagined

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:07.269
roughly behaves so you know we imagined
 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:09.780
roughly behaves so you know we imagined
a you know a single kind of podcast

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790
a you know a single kind of podcast
 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.300
a you know a single kind of podcast
creation or recording screen with a nice

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310
creation or recording screen with a nice
 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:15.869
creation or recording screen with a nice
big you know I guess chronometer or

00:04:15.869 --> 00:04:15.879
big you know I guess chronometer or
 

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:17.370
big you know I guess chronometer or
whatever to show that the current time

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380
whatever to show that the current time
 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.979
whatever to show that the current time
just so you know you know how you know

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989
just so you know you know how you know
 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:21.750
just so you know you know how you know
how far into the podcast you are you

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760
how far into the podcast you are you
 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.760
how far into the podcast you are you
want those you know those functions of

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770
want those you know those functions of
 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:24.270
want those you know those functions of
pause

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280
pause
 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.129
pause
resume and mute to be available

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:26.139
resume and mute to be available
 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:27.690
resume and mute to be available
immediately and then you want to have

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700
immediately and then you want to have
 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.460
immediately and then you want to have
some way of exposing live effects right

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470
some way of exposing live effects right
 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:31.680
some way of exposing live effects right
so things like the intro clip the actual

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690
so things like the intro clip the actual
 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:35.040
so things like the intro clip the actual
clips the be gone things like that

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050
clips the be gone things like that
 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.430
clips the be gone things like that
you'll be able to expose that we also

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440
you'll be able to expose that we also
 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:39.990
you'll be able to expose that we also
and then there's some couple of notes

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000
and then there's some couple of notes
 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.580
and then there's some couple of notes
than they're not very important actually

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590
than they're not very important actually
 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.230
than they're not very important actually
one of the things i wanted to mention is

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240
one of the things i wanted to mention is
 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.790
one of the things i wanted to mention is
that during the sketching process you

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800
that during the sketching process you
 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:45.930
that during the sketching process you
know it's always important to think

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:45.940
know it's always important to think
 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:48.690
know it's always important to think
about larger devices so you know these

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:48.700
about larger devices so you know these
 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.370
about larger devices so you know these
are some annotations that as I was

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:50.380
are some annotations that as I was
 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:51.960
are some annotations that as I was
sketching just thinking you know what

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:51.970
sketching just thinking you know what
 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:53.220
sketching just thinking you know what
would this look like I'm tablets and

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:53.230
would this look like I'm tablets and
 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:54.810
would this look like I'm tablets and
some of these annotations you know are

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:54.820
some of these annotations you know are
 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.700
some of these annotations you know are
just some very basic things like you

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710
just some very basic things like you
 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.740
just some very basic things like you
know the multiple tabs split out into

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:58.750
know the multiple tabs split out into
 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:01.260
know the multiple tabs split out into
multiple panes on tablets and you know

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.270
multiple panes on tablets and you know
 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.330
multiple panes on tablets and you know
this happens in landscape and so on so

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:03.340
this happens in landscape and so on so
 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:04.830
this happens in landscape and so on so
it's always good to keep in mind things

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:04.840
it's always good to keep in mind things
 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.570
it's always good to keep in mind things
even if you don't fully sketch them out

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580
even if you don't fully sketch them out
 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.750
even if you don't fully sketch them out
just a make note of your thought process

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:09.760
just a make note of your thought process
 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.610
just a make note of your thought process
of what things how things should adapt

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620
of what things how things should adapt
 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.550
of what things how things should adapt
on different devices the next thing we

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:14.560
on different devices the next thing we
 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:15.719
on different devices the next thing we
want to do is look at the different

00:05:15.719 --> 00:05:15.729
want to do is look at the different
 

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:18.300
want to do is look at the different
states so you know your app does have

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:18.310
states so you know your app does have
 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:21.000
states so you know your app does have
two states it has a paused in a I guess

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:21.010
two states it has a paused in a I guess
 

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:23.370
two states it has a paused in a I guess
a recording state and then there's

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:23.380
a recording state and then there's
 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:25.409
a recording state and then there's
here's just some ideas about what to do

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:25.419
here's just some ideas about what to do
 

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:27.030
here's just some ideas about what to do
with like the action bar what to do with

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:27.040
with like the action bar what to do with
 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:28.920
with like the action bar what to do with
the the playing part or the record and

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:28.930
the the playing part or the record and
 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:30.960
the the playing part or the record and
pause button and then another thing

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:30.970
pause button and then another thing
 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:32.219
pause button and then another thing
that's very important on Android

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:32.229
that's very important on Android
 

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:33.750
that's very important on Android
obviously is notifications and we've

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:33.760
obviously is notifications and we've
 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.610
obviously is notifications and we've
mentioned this probably a million times

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:35.620
mentioned this probably a million times
 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:37.860
mentioned this probably a million times
it's very important to have really kind

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:37.870
it's very important to have really kind
 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:39.750
it's very important to have really kind
of solid notifications so we immediately

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:39.760
of solid notifications so we immediately
 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:41.520
of solid notifications so we immediately
thought that as one of these states in

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:41.530
thought that as one of these states in
 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:43.050
thought that as one of these states in
this recording state we want to have a

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:43.060
this recording state we want to have a
 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:45.779
this recording state we want to have a
notification especially if the if you're

00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:45.789
notification especially if the if you're
 

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:47.940
notification especially if the if you're
not in the app and we just kind of did a

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:47.950
not in the app and we just kind of did a
 

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:49.170
not in the app and we just kind of did a
very quick mock of what that could look

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:49.180
very quick mock of what that could look
 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:50.820
very quick mock of what that could look
like with the with the pause and mute

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:50.830
like with the with the pause and mute
 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:52.529
like with the with the pause and mute
actions in line with the notification of

00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:52.539
actions in line with the notification of
 

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:53.909
actions in line with the notification of
course it's a rich notification which

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:53.919
course it's a rich notification which
 

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:56.070
course it's a rich notification which
has these uh polls and meet buttons

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:56.080
has these uh polls and meet buttons
 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.510
has these uh polls and meet buttons
directly in the notification which is

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:57.520
directly in the notification which is
 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.210
directly in the notification which is
really nice hmm and I think I'm not

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:00.220
really nice hmm and I think I'm not
 

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:01.890
really nice hmm and I think I'm not
fully sure I don't remember the exact

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:01.900
fully sure I don't remember the exact
 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:03.600
fully sure I don't remember the exact
framework details but I believe that in

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:03.610
framework details but I believe that in
 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:04.830
framework details but I believe that in
a notification you can actually also

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:04.840
a notification you can actually also
 

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:07.469
a notification you can actually also
specify a chronometer or chronometer or

00:06:07.469 --> 00:06:07.479
specify a chronometer or chronometer or
 

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:09.120
specify a chronometer or chronometer or
whatever it is so instead of showing the

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:09.130
whatever it is so instead of showing the
 

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:11.520
whatever it is so instead of showing the
time you can show the kind of time

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:11.530
time you can show the kind of time
 

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:13.650
time you can show the kind of time
elapsed for something so here it's just

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:13.660
elapsed for something so here it's just
 

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:15.779
elapsed for something so here it's just
showing the time elapsed incrementing

00:06:15.779 --> 00:06:15.789
showing the time elapsed incrementing
 

00:06:15.789 --> 00:06:17.250
showing the time elapsed incrementing
every second so you kind of get a feel

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:17.260
every second so you kind of get a feel
 

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.370
every second so you kind of get a feel
and on-the-fly updating feel for how

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:20.380
and on-the-fly updating feel for how
 

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:23.820
and on-the-fly updating feel for how
long the podcast can be is and then I

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:23.830
long the podcast can be is and then I
 

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:25.230
long the podcast can be is and then I
there's another note here and this is

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:25.240
there's another note here and this is
 

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:26.430
there's another note here and this is
something that that's just really

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:26.440
something that that's just really
 

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:28.650
something that that's just really
important to annotate your sketches to

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:28.660
important to annotate your sketches to
 

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:30.029
important to annotate your sketches to
make sure that you take down those those

00:06:30.029 --> 00:06:30.039
make sure that you take down those those
 

00:06:30.039 --> 00:06:31.550
make sure that you take down those those
brief moments of you know

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:31.560
brief moments of you know
 

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:33.500
brief moments of you know
of thought that you have when you're

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:33.510
of thought that you have when you're
 

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:34.640
of thought that you have when you're
thinking about all these different

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:34.650
thinking about all these different
 

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:37.040
thinking about all these different
things and then here's just another

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:37.050
things and then here's just another
 

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:39.290
things and then here's just another
quick sketch of what we thought things

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:39.300
quick sketch of what we thought things
 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:41.140
quick sketch of what we thought things
could look like on a tablet where again

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:41.150
could look like on a tablet where again
 

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:43.610
could look like on a tablet where again
things are slightly bigger you know the

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:43.620
things are slightly bigger you know the
 

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:46.340
things are slightly bigger you know the
time display is slightly bigger things

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:46.350
time display is slightly bigger things
 

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:48.680
time display is slightly bigger things
are you know slightly rearranged but

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:48.690
are you know slightly rearranged but
 

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:50.330
are you know slightly rearranged but
then your two tabs there then split out

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:50.340
then your two tabs there then split out
 

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:53.240
then your two tabs there then split out
into into multiple tabs or into multiple

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:53.250
into into multiple tabs or into multiple
 

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:55.220
into into multiple tabs or into multiple
panes we have the kind of live effects

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:55.230
panes we have the kind of live effects
 

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:57.620
panes we have the kind of live effects
at i right and the recording stuff in

00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:57.630
at i right and the recording stuff in
 

00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:00.710
at i right and the recording stuff in
the left so that was the sketching

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:00.720
the left so that was the sketching
 

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:03.500
the left so that was the sketching
process and you know obviously this is a

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:03.510
process and you know obviously this is a
 

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:05.629
process and you know obviously this is a
very compressed design process and in a

00:07:05.629 --> 00:07:05.639
very compressed design process and in a
 

00:07:05.639 --> 00:07:07.159
very compressed design process and in a
real design process you want to you know

00:07:07.159 --> 00:07:07.169
real design process you want to you know
 

00:07:07.169 --> 00:07:08.930
real design process you want to you know
sketch much more you want to iterate you

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:08.940
sketch much more you want to iterate you
 

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:10.129
sketch much more you want to iterate you
want to show it to people and get

00:07:10.129 --> 00:07:10.139
want to show it to people and get
 

00:07:10.139 --> 00:07:12.320
want to show it to people and get
feedback we only have you know like a

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:12.330
feedback we only have you know like a
 

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:13.850
feedback we only have you know like a
basically a day to do this so we didn't

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:13.860
basically a day to do this so we didn't
 

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:15.620
basically a day to do this so we didn't
really go through the whole process but

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:15.630
really go through the whole process but
 

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:17.659
really go through the whole process but
um you know once you're done with

00:07:17.659 --> 00:07:17.669
um you know once you're done with
 

00:07:17.669 --> 00:07:19.280
um you know once you're done with
sketches once you kind of have a good

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:19.290
sketches once you kind of have a good
 

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:20.750
sketches once you kind of have a good
feel of what things should look like the

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:20.760
feel of what things should look like the
 

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:23.570
feel of what things should look like the
next step is to do wireframing so oh I

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:23.580
next step is to do wireframing so oh I
 

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:25.850
next step is to do wireframing so oh I
actually you know that's the bitch nurse

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:25.860
actually you know that's the bitch nurse
 

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:28.400
actually you know that's the bitch nurse
knows every time good the next thing is

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:28.410
knows every time good the next thing is
 

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:30.980
knows every time good the next thing is
to do wireframing so this this looks a

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:30.990
to do wireframing so this this looks a
 

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:33.230
to do wireframing so this this looks a
little higher fidelity than like a

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:33.240
little higher fidelity than like a
 

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:36.140
little higher fidelity than like a
regular wireframe this is actually in

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:36.150
regular wireframe this is actually in
 

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:37.279
regular wireframe this is actually in
Illustrator this was done in illustrator

00:07:37.279 --> 00:07:37.289
Illustrator this was done in illustrator
 

00:07:37.289 --> 00:07:40.370
Illustrator this was done in illustrator
most of our screen mock-ups are done in

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:40.380
most of our screen mock-ups are done in
 

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:42.200
most of our screen mock-ups are done in
photoshop this week we decided to do

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:42.210
photoshop this week we decided to do
 

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:46.340
photoshop this week we decided to do
things in Illustrator and you you'll

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:46.350
things in Illustrator and you you'll
 

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:47.300
things in Illustrator and you you'll
actually you probably won't see this

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:47.310
actually you probably won't see this
 

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:49.400
actually you probably won't see this
year but almost all these elements are

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:49.410
year but almost all these elements are
 

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:51.529
year but almost all these elements are
from the stencil kit which we'll talk

00:07:51.529 --> 00:07:51.539
from the stencil kit which we'll talk
 

00:07:51.539 --> 00:07:54.590
from the stencil kit which we'll talk
about that comes on developers Angela

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:54.600
about that comes on developers Angela
 

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:57.380
about that comes on developers Angela
complex design / downloads and so they

00:07:57.380 --> 00:07:57.390
complex design / downloads and so they
 

00:07:57.390 --> 00:07:59.290
complex design / downloads and so they
provide you with a fairly high fidelity

00:07:59.290 --> 00:07:59.300
provide you with a fairly high fidelity
 

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:01.400
provide you with a fairly high fidelity
versions of things you don't necessarily

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:01.410
versions of things you don't necessarily
 

00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:02.960
versions of things you don't necessarily
have to do that you can use lower

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:02.970
have to do that you can use lower
 

00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:05.480
have to do that you can use lower
fidelity stencils even just squares and

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:05.490
fidelity stencils even just squares and
 

00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:06.860
fidelity stencils even just squares and
rectangles just to get a feel for the

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:06.870
rectangles just to get a feel for the
 

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:08.510
rectangles just to get a feel for the
positioning but in this case this is

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:08.520
positioning but in this case this is
 

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:10.070
positioning but in this case this is
kind of like a medium fidelity mark

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:10.080
kind of like a medium fidelity mark
 

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:11.900
kind of like a medium fidelity mark
where it's not pixel perfect but it is

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:11.910
where it's not pixel perfect but it is
 

00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:14.090
where it's not pixel perfect but it is
using the the actual visual elements of

00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:14.100
using the the actual visual elements of
 

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:16.760
using the the actual visual elements of
hollow so here's what your management

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:16.770
hollow so here's what your management
 

00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:19.250
hollow so here's what your management
screen can look like we roughly

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:19.260
screen can look like we roughly
 

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.260
screen can look like we roughly
separated things out in two drafts and

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:21.270
separated things out in two drafts and
 

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:23.180
separated things out in two drafts and
published so you know your drafts are

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:23.190
published so you know your drafts are
 

00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:24.440
published so you know your drafts are
probably the thing you're thinking about

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:24.450
probably the thing you're thinking about
 

00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:27.230
probably the thing you're thinking about
the most at any given moment is you know

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:27.240
the most at any given moment is you know
 

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:28.580
the most at any given moment is you know
the next step is that the next episode

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:28.590
the next step is that the next episode
 

00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:30.950
the next step is that the next episode
and so those are prioritized at the top

00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:30.960
and so those are prioritized at the top
 

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:33.350
and so those are prioritized at the top
and then there's there's a little subtle

00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:33.360
and then there's there's a little subtle
 

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.300
and then there's there's a little subtle
kind of way to rearrange them I don't

00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:35.310
kind of way to rearrange them I don't
 

00:08:35.310 --> 00:08:36.440
kind of way to rearrange them I don't
want now we're talking about this and

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:36.450
want now we're talking about this and
 

00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:37.850
want now we're talking about this and
yeah we were just thinking you know you

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:37.860
yeah we were just thinking you know you
 

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:39.680
yeah we were just thinking you know you
don't necessarily have to wait we

00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:39.690
don't necessarily have to wait we
 

00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:41.180
don't necessarily have to wait we
actually don't know a lot about creating

00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:41.190
actually don't know a lot about creating
 

00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:43.100
actually don't know a lot about creating
podcasts ourselves so depending on how

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:43.110
podcasts ourselves so depending on how
 

00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:43.780
podcasts ourselves so depending on how
you

00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:43.790
you
 

00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:45.580
you
think people create podcasts you could

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:45.590
think people create podcasts you could
 

00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:47.410
think people create podcasts you could
just prioritize these based on last

00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:47.420
just prioritize these based on last
 

00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:48.880
just prioritize these based on last
edited or last viewed or something like

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:48.890
edited or last viewed or something like
 

00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:50.860

that instead of be able to manually

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:50.870
that instead of be able to manually

that instead of be able to manually
rearrange I'm using those track handles

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:52.340
rearrange I'm using those track handles
 

00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:53.830
rearrange I'm using those track handles
and if you do that you should definitely

00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:53.840
and if you do that you should definitely
 

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:55.660
and if you do that you should definitely
mention like somewhere like over here

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:55.670
mention like somewhere like over here
 

00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:57.400
mention like somewhere like over here
there's like April April first you

00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:57.410
there's like April April first you
 

00:08:57.410 --> 00:08:59.080
there's like April April first you
should show like last edited in at a

00:08:59.080 --> 00:08:59.090
should show like last edited in at a
 

00:08:59.090 --> 00:09:00.220
should show like last edited in at a
time just so that it's completely

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:00.230
time just so that it's completely
 

00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:02.890
time just so that it's completely
obvious what the sort order is yeah you

00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:02.900
obvious what the sort order is yeah you
 

00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:04.060
obvious what the sort order is yeah you
could also limit it to like you know

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:04.070
could also limit it to like you know
 

00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:05.740
could also limit it to like you know
five most recent and have something it

00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:05.750
five most recent and have something it
 

00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:07.210
five most recent and have something it
says here show all those yeah that's

00:09:07.210 --> 00:09:07.220
says here show all those yeah that's
 

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:08.590
says here show all those yeah that's
that's nothing a good way to like I mean

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:08.600
that's nothing a good way to like I mean
 

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:10.360
that's nothing a good way to like I mean
you could actually do this using tabs

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:10.370
you could actually do this using tabs
 

00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:11.620
you could actually do this using tabs
right you could have drafts and then

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:11.630
right you could have drafts and then
 

00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:14.050
right you could have drafts and then
publish but this is kind of a it's a

00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:14.060
publish but this is kind of a it's a
 

00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:15.400
publish but this is kind of a it's a
nicer way for something everything at

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:15.410
nicer way for something everything at
 

00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:17.050
nicer way for something everything at
once oh that so there's a bird in the

00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:17.060
once oh that so there's a bird in the
 

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:20.590
once oh that so there's a bird in the
user with extra navigation okay so

00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:20.600
user with extra navigation okay so
 

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:24.160
user with extra navigation okay so
whoops so you know there's some some

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:24.170
whoops so you know there's some some
 

00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:26.110
whoops so you know there's some some
minor things here basically just kind of

00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:26.120
minor things here basically just kind of
 

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:27.370
minor things here basically just kind of
the difference between drafts and

00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:27.380
the difference between drafts and
 

00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:29.560
the difference between drafts and
publishes the most important thing just

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:29.570
publishes the most important thing just
 

00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:30.940
publishes the most important thing just
to kind of get the users thinking about

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:30.950
to kind of get the users thinking about
 

00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:33.700
to kind of get the users thinking about
was most important first so that's

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:33.710
was most important first so that's
 

00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:35.590
was most important first so that's
management we didn't kind of go into all

00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:35.600
management we didn't kind of go into all
 

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:37.860
management we didn't kind of go into all
the details of management I'll actually

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:37.870
the details of management I'll actually
 

00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:40.780
the details of management I'll actually
there's one missing screenshot here you

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:40.790
there's one missing screenshot here you
 

00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:41.530
there's one missing screenshot here you
know if you're managing multiple

00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:41.540
know if you're managing multiple
 

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:44.100
know if you're managing multiple
podcasts which you probably should allow

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:44.110
podcasts which you probably should allow
 

00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:46.090
podcasts which you probably should allow
great way to do those using the spinner

00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:46.100
great way to do those using the spinner
 

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:48.220
great way to do those using the spinner
navigation and actually another thing

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:48.230
navigation and actually another thing
 

00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:49.180
navigation and actually another thing
here is that there shouldn't be an app

00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:49.190
here is that there shouldn't be an app
 

00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:50.980
here is that there shouldn't be an app
icon because there's no nowhere to go up

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:50.990
icon because there's no nowhere to go up
 

00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:54.130
icon because there's no nowhere to go up
so this is like medium fidelity mock-ups

00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:54.140
so this is like medium fidelity mock-ups
 

00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:55.750
so this is like medium fidelity mock-ups
you're not really going to get the the

00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:55.760
you're not really going to get the the
 

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:58.050
you're not really going to get the the
fullest kind of view of things from this

00:09:58.050 --> 00:09:58.060
fullest kind of view of things from this
 

00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:02.830
fullest kind of view of things from this
anyway let's move on so next is the the

00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:02.840
anyway let's move on so next is the the
 

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:04.840
anyway let's move on so next is the the
creation and recording part and we spent

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:04.850
creation and recording part and we spent
 

00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:06.840
creation and recording part and we spent
a lot of time thinking through this

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:06.850
a lot of time thinking through this
 

00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:08.710
a lot of time thinking through this
since I think this is kind of the most

00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:08.720
since I think this is kind of the most
 

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:11.230
since I think this is kind of the most
unique aspect of a podcast creation app

00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:11.240
unique aspect of a podcast creation app
 

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:13.060
unique aspect of a podcast creation app
you have to really think about what the

00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:13.070
you have to really think about what the
 

00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:15.250
you have to really think about what the
process of recording is like what the

00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:15.260
process of recording is like what the
 

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.470
process of recording is like what the
what the user experience is like they're

00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:17.480
what the user experience is like they're
 

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:20.230
what the user experience is like they're
the process of managing blog posts or or

00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:20.240
the process of managing blog posts or or
 

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:22.270
the process of managing blog posts or or
you know managing podcast episodes very

00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:22.280
you know managing podcast episodes very
 

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:23.530
you know managing podcast episodes very
similar to blogs we didn't go into

00:10:23.530 --> 00:10:23.540
similar to blogs we didn't go into
 

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:25.720
similar to blogs we didn't go into
detail there but so some of the things

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:25.730
detail there but so some of the things
 

00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:26.950
detail there but so some of the things
you could do here and this is you know

00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:26.960
you could do here and this is you know
 

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:28.090
you could do here and this is you know
as you can see this is what it looks

00:10:28.090 --> 00:10:28.100
as you can see this is what it looks
 

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:30.580
as you can see this is what it looks
going to tablet so we split things up

00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:30.590
going to tablet so we split things up
 

00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:33.160
going to tablet so we split things up
into info and record right so info is

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:33.170
into info and record right so info is
 

00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:35.350
into info and record right so info is
basically letting you manage the the

00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:35.360
basically letting you manage the the
 

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:37.780
basically letting you manage the the
basic details of the episode like the

00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:37.790
basic details of the episode like the
 

00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:40.780
basic details of the episode like the
title the description things like that

00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:40.790
title the description things like that
 

00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:42.550
title the description things like that
but the most important part is the

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:42.560
but the most important part is the
 

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:44.770
but the most important part is the
recording process so here you'll see

00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:44.780
recording process so here you'll see
 

00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:46.960
recording process so here you'll see
that you know there's a nice big preview

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:46.970
that you know there's a nice big preview
 

00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:49.870
that you know there's a nice big preview
of the the current duration nice big

00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:49.880
of the the current duration nice big
 

00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:52.990
of the the current duration nice big
affordances four paws and mute and then

00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:53.000
affordances four paws and mute and then
 

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.220
affordances four paws and mute and then
this is kind of like interesting

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:54.230
this is kind of like interesting
 

00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:56.230
this is kind of like interesting
flourish and this is where you can start

00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:56.240
flourish and this is where you can start
 

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:57.110
flourish and this is where you can start
exploring

00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:57.120
exploring
 

00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:59.540
exploring
different UI types in a different

00:10:59.540 --> 00:10:59.550
different UI types in a different
 

00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:02.060
different UI types in a different
interesting UI elements you know it's

00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:02.070
interesting UI elements you know it's
 

00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:03.440
interesting UI elements you know it's
it's less interesting in sketches

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:03.450
it's less interesting in sketches
 

00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:05.150
it's less interesting in sketches
because a little harder to visualize but

00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:05.160
because a little harder to visualize but
 

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:06.769
because a little harder to visualize but
once you get down to you know low to

00:11:06.769 --> 00:11:06.779
once you get down to you know low to
 

00:11:06.779 --> 00:11:08.990
once you get down to you know low to
medium fidelity wireframes you can start

00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:09.000
medium fidelity wireframes you can start
 

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.310
medium fidelity wireframes you can start
thinking through different interactions

00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:10.320
thinking through different interactions
 

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:11.870
thinking through different interactions
so in this case we just thought you know

00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:11.880
so in this case we just thought you know
 

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:13.430
so in this case we just thought you know
we're going to be cool if you kind of

00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:13.440
we're going to be cool if you kind of
 

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:16.430
we're going to be cool if you kind of
have this like bar that changes height

00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:16.440
have this like bar that changes height
 

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:18.320
have this like bar that changes height
based on the current volume and then

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:18.330
based on the current volume and then
 

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:21.260
based on the current volume and then
from from the left it actually just

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:21.270
from from the left it actually just
 

00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:23.600
from from the left it actually just
creates the waves the wave is slowly

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:23.610
creates the waves the wave is slowly
 

00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:26.269
creates the waves the wave is slowly
progressing to the left but this is this

00:11:26.269 --> 00:11:26.279
progressing to the left but this is this
 

00:11:26.279 --> 00:11:27.680
progressing to the left but this is this
little bar here is kind of growing and

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:27.690
little bar here is kind of growing and
 

00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:28.970
little bar here is kind of growing and
shrinking and then when you're not

00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:28.980
shrinking and then when you're not
 

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:31.910
shrinking and then when you're not
recording it just goes away so that's

00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:31.920
recording it just goes away so that's
 

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:33.620
recording it just goes away so that's
kind of one interesting take on it I

00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:33.630
kind of one interesting take on it I
 

00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:35.750
kind of one interesting take on it I
haven't seen that before and then

00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:35.760
haven't seen that before and then
 

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:36.740
haven't seen that before and then
another thing that we did here is we

00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:36.750
another thing that we did here is we
 

00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:41.600
another thing that we did here is we
combined the the live effect into into

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:41.610
combined the the live effect into into
 

00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:43.100
combined the the live effect into into
the screen so we kind of took the

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:43.110
the screen so we kind of took the
 

00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:45.260
the screen so we kind of took the
standard multi-pane approach we use a

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:45.270
standard multi-pane approach we use a
 

00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:46.940
standard multi-pane approach we use a
combination of tabs and multi-pane here

00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:46.950
combination of tabs and multi-pane here
 

00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:49.790
combination of tabs and multi-pane here
but kind of a standard kind of great way

00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:49.800
but kind of a standard kind of great way
 

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:51.980
but kind of a standard kind of great way
to use space I guess and this is nice

00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:51.990
to use space I guess and this is nice
 

00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:53.329
to use space I guess and this is nice
because you obviously want easy access

00:11:53.329 --> 00:11:53.339
because you obviously want easy access
 

00:11:53.339 --> 00:11:54.980
because you obviously want easy access
to these effects while you're recording

00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:54.990
to these effects while you're recording
 

00:11:54.990 --> 00:11:56.810
to these effects while you're recording
where is the info you can sort of edit

00:11:56.810 --> 00:11:56.820
where is the info you can sort of edit
 

00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:58.850
where is the info you can sort of edit
once before orgo you know when you've

00:11:58.850 --> 00:11:58.860
once before orgo you know when you've
 

00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:00.530
once before orgo you know when you've
paused or something like that yeah and

00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:00.540
paused or something like that yeah and
 

00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:01.760
paused or something like that yeah and
we'll see on the phone you still have

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:01.770
we'll see on the phone you still have
 

00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:03.829
we'll see on the phone you still have
access to the stuff but it means just

00:12:03.829 --> 00:12:03.839
access to the stuff but it means just
 

00:12:03.839 --> 00:12:05.150
access to the stuff but it means just
one swipe oh yeah it's just taking

00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:05.160
one swipe oh yeah it's just taking
 

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:06.260
one swipe oh yeah it's just taking
advantage of the extra screen real

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:06.270
advantage of the extra screen real
 

00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:08.150
advantage of the extra screen real
estate of the larger device and then

00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:08.160
estate of the larger device and then
 

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:09.620
estate of the larger device and then
here are just some examples of how you

00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:09.630
here are just some examples of how you
 

00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:11.570
here are just some examples of how you
can present like clips and live effects

00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:11.580
can present like clips and live effects
 

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:12.860
can present like clips and live effects
obviously you know pressing the dada

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:12.870
obviously you know pressing the dada
 

00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:15.050
obviously you know pressing the dada
thought should show you should kind of

00:12:15.050 --> 00:12:15.060
thought should show you should kind of
 

00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:17.030
thought should show you should kind of
take you to a customization or more

00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:17.040
take you to a customization or more
 

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:19.430
take you to a customization or more
effects screen or something like that so

00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:19.440
effects screen or something like that so
 

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:22.010
effects screen or something like that so
let's move on so here's what it will

00:12:22.010 --> 00:12:22.020
let's move on so here's what it will
 

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:23.870
let's move on so here's what it will
look like on a phone again very similar

00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:23.880
look like on a phone again very similar
 

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:26.510
look like on a phone again very similar
just that the effects portion is taken

00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:26.520
just that the effects portion is taken
 

00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:28.610
just that the effects portion is taken
into a separate tab and you have

00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:28.620
into a separate tab and you have
 

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:30.530
into a separate tab and you have
basically the same UI is it's somewhat

00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:30.540
basically the same UI is it's somewhat
 

00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:33.710
basically the same UI is it's somewhat
responsive I mean you still have slight

00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:33.720
responsive I mean you still have slight
 

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:35.630
responsive I mean you still have slight
changes in a VIN core navigation between

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:35.640
changes in a VIN core navigation between
 

00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:38.060
changes in a VIN core navigation between
tablet or phone but the core apt is

00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:38.070
tablet or phone but the core apt is
 

00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:40.940
tablet or phone but the core apt is
still very much the same so this is the

00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:40.950
still very much the same so this is the
 

00:12:40.950 --> 00:12:42.620
still very much the same so this is the
recording state now what does it look

00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:42.630
recording state now what does it look
 

00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:44.900
recording state now what does it look
like in the in the pause state so in the

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:44.910
like in the in the pause state so in the
 

00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:46.460
like in the in the pause state so in the
pause state year you no longer have the

00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:46.470
pause state year you no longer have the

and then of course if you exit out the

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:25.170
and then of course if you exit out the
 

00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:26.540

effects and this is kind of one of the

00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:30.030
effects and this is kind of one of the
 

00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:31.250
effects and this is kind of one of the
reit one of the biggest reasons for this

00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:31.260
reit one of the biggest reasons for this
 

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.110
reit one of the biggest reasons for this
if you're in effect if you're playing an

if you're in effect if you're playing an
 

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:34.190
if you're in effect if you're playing an

that's done playing you kind of unmute

00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:39.510
that's done playing you kind of unmute
 

00:14:39.510 --> 00:14:41.330
that's done playing you kind of unmute
so it's it's very easy from a single

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:41.340
so it's it's very easy from a single
 

00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:43.280
so it's it's very easy from a single
screen at any point to do what you want

screen at any point to do what you want
 

00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:46.940
screen at any point to do what you want
to do and then they'll think one of the

00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:46.950
to do and then they'll think one of the
 

00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:49.100
to do and then they'll think one of the
last components of this is what happens

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:49.110
last components of this is what happens
 

00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:50.780
last components of this is what happens
when you're in the info screen and

00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:50.790
when you're in the info screen and
 

00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:53.329
when you're in the info screen and
you're paused at that point you probably

00:14:53.329 --> 00:14:53.339
you're paused at that point you probably
 

00:14:53.339 --> 00:14:55.100
you're paused at that point you probably
want to give the user the option to

00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:55.110
want to give the user the option to
 

00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:57.020
want to give the user the option to
preview and publish so they press

preview publish it takes them to a
separate flow where they can kind of

separate flow where they can kind of
 

00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:03.470
separate flow where they can kind of
maybe even edit make tweaks but they

00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:03.480
maybe even edit make tweaks but they
 

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:05.600
maybe even edit make tweaks but they
they can kind of preview what they've

there's nothing very revolutionary but
 

00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:22.180
there's nothing very revolutionary but
here's just one approach at creating

00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:22.190
here's just one approach at creating
 

00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:24.970
here's just one approach at creating
podcast creation and I think there's one

00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:24.980
podcast creation and I think there's one
 

00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:28.480

more screen on editing so we couldn't

more screen on editing so we couldn't
 

00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:29.740
more screen on editing so we couldn't
really we didn't spend the time to

figure out where this would go into the
 

00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:34.690
figure out where this would go into the
greater scheme of the app but you know

00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:34.700
greater scheme of the app but you know
 

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:35.829
greater scheme of the app but you know
one of the things that's that's

00:15:35.829 --> 00:15:35.839
one of the things that's that's
 

00:15:35.839 --> 00:15:37.510
one of the things that's that's
interesting is you know this is a

00:15:37.510 --> 00:15:37.520
interesting is you know this is a
 

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:40.960
interesting is you know this is a
different type of of medium that that

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:40.970
different type of of medium that that

00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:56.690
can do something like long press on the
 

00:15:56.690 --> 00:15:58.990
can do something like long press on the
audio to kind of select like a second or

00:15:58.990 --> 00:15:59.000
audio to kind of select like a second or
 

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.490
audio to kind of select like a second or
so and then show these little drag

00:16:00.490 --> 00:16:00.500
so and then show these little drag
 

00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:03.430
so and then show these little drag
handles so you can drag them around and

00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:03.440
handles so you can drag them around and
 

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:04.360
handles so you can drag them around and
then you can have like an insertion

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:04.370
then you can have like an insertion
 

00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:06.040
then you can have like an insertion
point so if you have something in the

00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:06.050
point so if you have something in the
 

00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:08.590
point so if you have something in the
clipboard then you can kind of like do a

00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:08.600
clipboard then you can kind of like do a
 

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:11.320
clipboard then you can kind of like do a
paste you should also offer things we're

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:11.330
paste you should also offer things we're
 

00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:12.850
paste you should also offer things we're
going to show this here but you know

00:16:12.850 --> 00:16:12.860
going to show this here but you know
 

00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:15.400
going to show this here but you know
things like fade out fade in all sorts

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:15.410
things like fade out fade in all sorts
 

00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:17.440
things like fade out fade in all sorts
of effects those are very contextual to

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:17.450
of effects those are very contextual to
 

00:16:17.450 --> 00:16:19.600
of effects those are very contextual to
the current point in the audio you're

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:19.610
the current point in the audio you're
 

00:16:19.610 --> 00:16:21.640
the current point in the audio you're
looking at so definitely make sure to

00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:21.650
looking at so definitely make sure to
 

00:16:21.650 --> 00:16:24.519
looking at so definitely make sure to
kind of use this type of you I if you're

00:16:24.519 --> 00:16:24.529
kind of use this type of you I if you're
 

00:16:24.529 --> 00:16:26.560
kind of use this type of you I if you're
doing sort of editing it could make a

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:26.570
doing sort of editing it could make a
 

00:16:26.570 --> 00:16:27.730
doing sort of editing it could make a
lot of sense and then we're chatting

00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:27.740
lot of sense and then we're chatting
 

00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:30.160
lot of sense and then we're chatting
about a pretty neat addition or feature

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:30.170
about a pretty neat addition or feature
 

00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:31.750
about a pretty neat addition or feature
where you could possibly play the first

00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:31.760
where you could possibly play the first
 

00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:34.540
where you could possibly play the first
second of the selected clip and maybe

00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:34.550
second of the selected clip and maybe
 

00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:35.890
second of the selected clip and maybe
the last second as well so you can sort

00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:35.900
the last second as well so you can sort
 

00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:37.449
the last second as well so you can sort
of make sure that your anchor points are

00:16:37.449 --> 00:16:37.459
of make sure that your anchor points are
 

00:16:37.459 --> 00:16:38.890
of make sure that your anchor points are
sort of at the point you want them to be

00:16:38.890 --> 00:16:38.900
sort of at the point you want them to be
 

00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:40.660
sort of at the point you want them to be
yeah like one way you could do that is

00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:40.670
yeah like one way you could do that is
 

00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:42.160
yeah like one way you could do that is
you can offer like little play buttons

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:42.170
you can offer like little play buttons
 

00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:43.660
you can offer like little play buttons
here so like a little play button here

00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:43.670
here so like a little play button here
 

00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:45.550
here so like a little play button here
and pressing that plays it for a second

00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:45.560
and pressing that plays it for a second
 

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:47.680
and pressing that plays it for a second
and a play button here that plays the

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:47.690
and a play button here that plays the
 

00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:50.560
and a play button here that plays the
the last second up to that point so you

00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:50.570
the last second up to that point so you
 

00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:52.060
the last second up to that point so you
probably let me just so that like you

00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:52.070
probably let me just so that like you
 

00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:53.860
probably let me just so that like you
have kind of like the I guess not the

00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:53.870
have kind of like the I guess not the
 

00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:56.340
have kind of like the I guess not the
pixel perfect but the the frame perfect

00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:56.350
pixel perfect but the the frame perfect
 

00:16:56.350 --> 00:16:58.660
pixel perfect but the the frame perfect
view of things another thing I wanted to

00:16:58.660 --> 00:16:58.670
view of things another thing I wanted to
 

00:16:58.670 --> 00:17:01.300
view of things another thing I wanted to
mention is is gestures so you also want

00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:01.310
mention is is gestures so you also want
 

00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:03.130
mention is is gestures so you also want
to support gestures like you know multi

00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:03.140
to support gestures like you know multi
 

00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:05.799
to support gestures like you know multi
finger gestures and then like the other

00:17:05.799 --> 00:17:05.809
finger gestures and then like the other
 

00:17:05.809 --> 00:17:07.929
finger gestures and then like the other
scrolling gesture and if you're

00:17:07.929 --> 00:17:07.939
scrolling gesture and if you're
 

00:17:07.939 --> 00:17:09.309
scrolling gesture and if you're
implementing this actually just wanted

00:17:09.309 --> 00:17:09.319
implementing this actually just wanted
 

00:17:09.319 --> 00:17:12.069
implementing this actually just wanted
to make a kind of a quick shout out

00:17:12.069 --> 00:17:12.079

let's move on to design tools yeah yeah

00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:41.130
let's move on to design tools yeah yeah
 

00:17:41.130 --> 00:17:43.460
let's move on to design tools yeah yeah
so design tools when we talk about

00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:43.470
so design tools when we talk about
 

00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:46.759
so design tools when we talk about
design tools we like to you know not

00:17:46.759 --> 00:17:46.769
design tools we like to you know not
 

00:17:46.769 --> 00:17:49.580
design tools we like to you know not
just we like to break things out by the

00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:49.590
just we like to break things out by the
 

00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:52.430
just we like to break things out by the
hat you wear the the discipline so we

00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:52.440
hat you wear the the discipline so we
 

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:53.570
hat you wear the the discipline so we
don't like to just talk about you know

don't like to just talk about you know
 

00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:55.070
don't like to just talk about you know
here's just the basic design tool for

00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:55.080
here's just the basic design tool for
 

00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:56.899
here's just the basic design tool for
designers it's there's different

00:17:56.899 --> 00:17:56.909
designers it's there's different
 

00:17:56.909 --> 00:17:57.980
designers it's there's different
disciplines like interaction design

00:17:57.980 --> 00:17:57.990

can create like an interactive PDF where

00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:13.620
can create like an interactive PDF where
 

00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:14.779
can create like an interactive PDF where
you click on different things and it

00:19:14.779 --> 00:19:14.789
you click on different things and it
 

00:19:14.789 --> 00:19:16.399
you click on different things and it
takes you to different pages and it's

00:19:16.399 --> 00:19:16.409
takes you to different pages and it's
 

00:19:16.409 --> 00:19:19.879
takes you to different pages and it's
kind of a much nicer way to to visualize

00:19:19.879 --> 00:19:19.889
kind of a much nicer way to to visualize
 

00:19:19.889 --> 00:19:22.129
kind of a much nicer way to to visualize
a flow or to visualize a sequence of

00:19:22.129 --> 00:19:22.139
a flow or to visualize a sequence of
 

00:19:22.139 --> 00:19:24.110
a flow or to visualize a sequence of
events in your app so definite consider

00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:24.120
events in your app so definite consider
 

00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:24.850
events in your app so definite consider
doing that

00:19:24.850 --> 00:19:24.860
doing that
 

00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:27.010
doing that
and then here's there's a recent article

00:19:27.010 --> 00:19:27.020
and then here's there's a recent article
 

00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:28.840
and then here's there's a recent article
in smashing my calm and how to use

00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:28.850
in smashing my calm and how to use
 

00:19:28.850 --> 00:19:30.940
in smashing my calm and how to use
InDesign to do something very similar I

00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:30.950
InDesign to do something very similar I
 

00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:32.440
InDesign to do something very similar I
haven't tried this myself but it seems

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:32.450
haven't tried this myself but it seems
 

00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:33.669
haven't tried this myself but it seems
really interesting so if you're doing

00:19:33.669 --> 00:19:33.679
really interesting so if you're doing
 

00:19:33.679 --> 00:19:35.350
really interesting so if you're doing
interaction design definitely check out

00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:35.360
interaction design definitely check out
 

00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:37.419
interaction design definitely check out
this article about in design interaction

00:19:37.419 --> 00:19:37.429
this article about in design interaction
 

00:19:37.429 --> 00:19:42.430
this article about in design interaction
design let's move on to some other

00:19:42.430 --> 00:19:42.440
design let's move on to some other
 

00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:45.370
design let's move on to some other
interaction design tools you know so for

00:19:45.370 --> 00:19:45.380
interaction design tools you know so for
 

00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:47.080
interaction design tools you know so for
interaction design obviously one of the

00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:47.090
interaction design obviously one of the
 

00:19:47.090 --> 00:19:48.400
interaction design obviously one of the
things you want to do is sketch a lot a

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:48.410
things you want to do is sketch a lot a
 

00:19:48.410 --> 00:19:51.250
things you want to do is sketch a lot a
lot a lot a lot but there also some some

00:19:51.250 --> 00:19:51.260
lot a lot a lot but there also some some
 

00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:53.950
lot a lot a lot but there also some some
I guess software tools for for sketching

00:19:53.950 --> 00:19:53.960
I guess software tools for for sketching
 

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:55.960
I guess software tools for for sketching
I guess for creating wireframes and

00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:55.970
I guess for creating wireframes and
 

00:19:55.970 --> 00:19:57.760
I guess for creating wireframes and
especially interactive wireframes here's

00:19:57.760 --> 00:19:57.770
especially interactive wireframes here's
 

00:19:57.770 --> 00:19:59.919
especially interactive wireframes here's
a quick selection of them I generally

00:19:59.919 --> 00:19:59.929
a quick selection of them I generally
 

00:19:59.929 --> 00:20:03.280
a quick selection of them I generally
prefer using OmniGraffle since we have

00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:03.290
prefer using OmniGraffle since we have
 

00:20:03.290 --> 00:20:05.830
prefer using OmniGraffle since we have
official stencils for those and you can

00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:05.840
official stencils for those and you can
 

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:08.620
official stencils for those and you can
actually do both low and high fidelity

00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:08.630
actually do both low and high fidelity
 

00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:10.570
actually do both low and high fidelity
wireframes they're almost all the other

00:20:10.570 --> 00:20:10.580
wireframes they're almost all the other
 

00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:11.650
wireframes they're almost all the other
tools since they don't have official

00:20:11.650 --> 00:20:11.660
tools since they don't have official
 

00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:14.289
tools since they don't have official
stencils they have like unofficial

00:20:14.289 --> 00:20:14.299
stencils they have like unofficial
 

00:20:14.299 --> 00:20:15.610
stencils they have like unofficial
stencils which aren't really high

00:20:15.610 --> 00:20:15.620
stencils which aren't really high
 

00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:17.320
stencils which aren't really high
fidelity which is fine I mean for

00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:17.330
fidelity which is fine I mean for
 

00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:19.180
fidelity which is fine I mean for
wireframes it so it's totally okay a

00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:19.190
wireframes it so it's totally okay a
 

00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:21.880
wireframes it so it's totally okay a

the next thing we want to talk about
 

00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:32.730
the next thing we want to talk about
with Android design preview so this is

00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:32.740
with Android design preview so this is
 

00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:35.730
with Android design preview so this is
more for visual designers and this

00:21:35.730 --> 00:21:35.740
more for visual designers and this
 

00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:39.270
more for visual designers and this
basically lets you mirror a portion of

00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:39.280
basically lets you mirror a portion of
 

00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:41.960
basically lets you mirror a portion of
your screen from your computer to your

00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:41.970
your screen from your computer to your
 

00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:44.370
your screen from your computer to your
to your Android device so let's say you

00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:44.380
to your Android device so let's say you
 

00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:45.990
to your Android device so let's say you
have photoshop open and you're doing

00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:46.000
have photoshop open and you're doing
 

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.020
have photoshop open and you're doing
like AHA you have a high fidelity visual

00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:48.030
like AHA you have a high fidelity visual
 

00:21:48.030 --> 00:21:50.280
like AHA you have a high fidelity visual
mock-up open this is actually something

00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:50.290
mock-up open this is actually something
 

00:21:50.290 --> 00:21:53.030
mock-up open this is actually something
from our from one of our past episodes

00:21:53.030 --> 00:21:53.040
from our from one of our past episodes

from our from one of our past episodes
so all you need to do is you need to

00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:54.970
so all you need to do is you need to
 

00:21:54.970 --> 00:21:56.910
so all you need to do is you need to
open up the Android design preview app

00:21:56.910 --> 00:21:56.920
open up the Android design preview app
 

00:21:56.920 --> 00:22:00.690
open up the Android design preview app
this little window that pops up here you

00:22:00.690 --> 00:22:00.700
this little window that pops up here you
 

00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:02.910
this little window that pops up here you
can then drag around this red rectangle

00:22:02.910 --> 00:22:02.920
can then drag around this red rectangle
 

00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:04.200
can then drag around this red rectangle
and kind of faint you can't really see

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:04.210
and kind of faint you can't really see
 

00:22:04.210 --> 00:22:07.020
and kind of faint you can't really see
it be dragged it to encapsulate you're

00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:07.030
it be dragged it to encapsulate you're
 

00:22:07.030 --> 00:22:08.490
it be dragged it to encapsulate you're
near the part of the screen that you

00:22:08.490 --> 00:22:08.500
near the part of the screen that you
 

00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:11.460
near the part of the screen that you
wanna mirror and then it mirrors that to

00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:11.470
wanna mirror and then it mirrors that to
 

00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:13.580
wanna mirror and then it mirrors that to
your device what's not pictured here is

00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:13.590
your device what's not pictured here is
 

00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:16.920
your device what's not pictured here is
the i guess the USB cable you plugged in

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:16.930
the i guess the USB cable you plugged in
 

00:22:16.930 --> 00:22:21.180
the i guess the USB cable you plugged in
so you need to use USB and it doesn't

00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:21.190
so you need to use USB and it doesn't
 

00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:23.220
so you need to use USB and it doesn't
work over Wi-Fi currently but it's

00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:23.230
work over Wi-Fi currently but it's
 

00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:24.960
work over Wi-Fi currently but it's
definitely a good tool to have in your

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:24.970
definitely a good tool to have in your
 

00:22:24.970 --> 00:22:30.990
definitely a good tool to have in your
arsenal next we have actually want to

00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:31.000
arsenal next we have actually want to
 

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.760
arsenal next we have actually want to
spend a little bit of time on this so

00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:32.770
spend a little bit of time on this so
 

00:22:32.770 --> 00:22:35.430
spend a little bit of time on this so
you know a lot of lot of designers on

00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:35.440
you know a lot of lot of designers on
 

00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:38.100
you know a lot of lot of designers on
Android I guess they often not really

00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:38.110
Android I guess they often not really
 

00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:39.720
Android I guess they often not really
complain but they they lament that

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:39.730
complain but they they lament that
 

00:22:39.730 --> 00:22:41.610

00:23:03.010 --> 00:23:04.860
of tools out there that can help in the
process and this is especially true if

00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:04.870
process and this is especially true if

language right so if you have your

00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:07.660
language right so if you have your
 

00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:09.540
language right so if you have your
completely custom UI there's not really

00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:09.550
completely custom UI there's not really
 

00:23:09.550 --> 00:23:11.370

know plugins that i'll do that and but
 

00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:19.740
know plugins that i'll do that and but
for the most part you know if you're

00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:19.750
for the most part you know if you're
 

00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:20.850
for the most part you know if you're
following hollow there's some really

00:23:20.850 --> 00:23:20.860
following hollow there's some really
 

00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:23.400
following hollow there's some really
good tools online for this so the first

00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:23.410
good tools online for this so the first
 

00:23:23.410 --> 00:23:25.140
good tools online for this so the first
is the android assets to do we covered

00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:25.150
is the android assets to do we covered
 

00:23:25.150 --> 00:23:26.850
is the android assets to do we covered
this before someone go into detail on it

00:23:26.850 --> 00:23:26.860
this before someone go into detail on it
 

00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:29.100
this before someone go into detail on it
but the next is the action bar style

00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:29.110
but the next is the action bar style
 

00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:30.780
but the next is the action bar style
generator which we talked about in the

00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:30.790
generator which we talked about in the
 

00:23:30.790 --> 00:23:32.310
generator which we talked about in the
past episode i just want to reiterate

00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:32.320
past episode i just want to reiterate
 

00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:34.430
past episode i just want to reiterate
how important it is to use this tool

00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:34.440
how important it is to use this tool
 

00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:37.560
how important it is to use this tool
basically lets you you know very quickly

00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:37.570
basically lets you you know very quickly
 

00:23:37.570 --> 00:23:39.990
basically lets you you know very quickly
you know throw in a few colors and it

00:23:39.990 --> 00:23:40.000
you know throw in a few colors and it
 

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:40.169
you know throw in a few colors and it
would

00:23:40.169 --> 00:23:40.179
would
 

00:23:40.179 --> 00:23:42.899
would
generate all the stuff all the cruft the

00:23:42.899 --> 00:23:42.909
generate all the stuff all the cruft the
 

00:23:42.909 --> 00:23:45.690
generate all the stuff all the cruft the
xml files the PNG files basically

00:23:45.690 --> 00:23:45.700
xml files the PNG files basically
 

00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:47.009
xml files the PNG files basically
everything that you need to get your

00:23:47.009 --> 00:23:47.019
everything that you need to get your
 

00:23:47.019 --> 00:23:49.350
everything that you need to get your
action bar like kind of to a base level

00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:49.360
action bar like kind of to a base level
 

00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:51.450
action bar like kind of to a base level
of theming it's a good jump stat and I

00:23:51.450 --> 00:23:51.460
of theming it's a good jump stat and I
 

00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:52.529
of theming it's a good jump stat and I
think it's also compatible with the

00:23:52.529 --> 00:23:52.539
think it's also compatible with the
 

00:23:52.539 --> 00:23:54.779
think it's also compatible with the
action bar show yeah that's right so

00:23:54.779 --> 00:23:54.789
action bar show yeah that's right so
 

00:23:54.789 --> 00:23:57.060
action bar show yeah that's right so
there's an option to create Sherlock

00:23:57.060 --> 00:23:57.070
there's an option to create Sherlock
 

00:23:57.070 --> 00:23:58.680
there's an option to create Sherlock
styles so if you're using

00:25:47.919 --> 00:25:50.169
focused meaning the keyboard has kind of
you know the user has selected that

00:25:50.169 --> 00:25:50.179
you know the user has selected that
 

00:25:50.179 --> 00:25:52.749
you know the user has selected that
item with the keyboard it'll use the

00:25:52.749 --> 00:25:52.759
item with the keyboard it'll use the
 

00:25:52.759 --> 00:25:55.149
item with the keyboard it'll use the
standard kind of focus style with

00:25:55.149 --> 00:25:55.159
standard kind of focus style with
 

00:25:55.159 --> 00:25:57.310
standard kind of focus style with
different levels of translucency but

00:25:57.310 --> 00:25:57.320
different levels of translucency but
 

00:25:57.320 --> 00:25:59.139
different levels of translucency but
I'll still apply your accent color so

00:25:59.139 --> 00:25:59.149
I'll still apply your accent color so
 

00:25:59.149 --> 00:26:00.970
I'll still apply your accent color so
the action bar style generator is really

00:26:00.970 --> 00:26:00.980
the action bar style generator is really
 

00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:03.340
the action bar style generator is really
good for generating that and I said the

00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:03.350
good for generating that and I said the
 

00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:05.950
good for generating that and I said the
combination of these two tools gets you

00:26:05.950 --> 00:26:05.960
combination of these two tools gets you
 

00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:08.169
combination of these two tools gets you
most of the way for baseline branding of

00:26:08.169 --> 00:26:08.179
most of the way for baseline branding of
 

00:26:08.179 --> 00:26:09.940
most of the way for baseline branding of
a nap so definitely use them really

00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:09.950
a nap so definitely use them really
 

00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:13.840
a nap so definitely use them really
important to do it last thing I guess

00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:13.850
important to do it last thing I guess
 

00:26:13.850 --> 00:26:15.850
important to do it last thing I guess
for design tools and we'll probably talk

00:26:15.850 --> 00:26:15.860
for design tools and we'll probably talk
 

00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:18.039
for design tools and we'll probably talk
more in future episodes on design tools

00:26:18.039 --> 00:26:18.049
more in future episodes on design tools
 

00:26:18.049 --> 00:26:20.470
more in future episodes on design tools
but the last thing I wanted to call out

00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:20.480
but the last thing I wanted to call out
 

00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:22.560
but the last thing I wanted to call out
today is just feedback tools right so

00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:22.570
today is just feedback tools right so
 

00:26:22.570 --> 00:26:25.840
today is just feedback tools right so
you know we very often provide designers

00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:25.850
you know we very often provide designers
 

00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:27.399
you know we very often provide designers
developers with feedback they give us a

00:26:27.399 --> 00:26:27.409
developers with feedback they give us a
 

00:26:27.409 --> 00:26:30.100
developers with feedback they give us a
PDFs we provide them with feedback back

00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:30.110
PDFs we provide them with feedback back
 

00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:32.859
PDFs we provide them with feedback back
so some of the tools that we use our

00:26:32.859 --> 00:26:32.869
so some of the tools that we use our
 

00:26:32.869 --> 00:26:35.889

developers or product managers to
 

00:27:10.399 --> 00:27:12.159
developers or product managers to
communicate with designers as well as

00:27:12.159 --> 00:27:12.169
communicate with designers as well as
 

00:27:12.169 --> 00:27:14.320
communicate with designers as well as
for designers to communicate to

00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:14.330
for designers to communicate to
 

00:27:14.330 --> 00:27:16.509
for designers to communicate to
developers so designers rather than

00:27:16.509 --> 00:27:16.519
developers so designers rather than
 

00:27:16.519 --> 00:27:18.489
developers so designers rather than
using specs or red lines if you don't

00:27:18.489 --> 00:27:18.499
using specs or red lines if you don't
 

00:27:18.499 --> 00:27:20.109
using specs or red lines if you don't
want to you could just you know create

00:27:20.109 --> 00:27:20.119
want to you could just you know create
 

00:27:20.119 --> 00:27:21.850
want to you could just you know create
your mock-ups you know throw them into a

00:27:21.850 --> 00:27:21.860
your mock-ups you know throw them into a
 

00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:23.649
your mock-ups you know throw them into a
PDF and then just annotate like this

00:27:23.649 --> 00:27:23.659
PDF and then just annotate like this
 

00:27:23.659 --> 00:27:26.409
PDF and then just annotate like this
should stretch this should you know

00:27:26.409 --> 00:27:26.419
should stretch this should you know
 

00:27:26.419 --> 00:27:28.749
should stretch this should you know
should be whatever something else you

00:27:28.749 --> 00:27:28.759
should be whatever something else you
 

00:27:28.759 --> 00:27:30.580
should be whatever something else you
could use PDF editors or PDF and yeah we

00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:30.590
could use PDF editors or PDF and yeah we
 

00:27:30.590 --> 00:27:32.529
could use PDF editors or PDF and yeah we
use this as a feedback mechanism a lot

00:27:32.529 --> 00:27:32.539
use this as a feedback mechanism a lot
 

00:27:32.539 --> 00:27:34.989
use this as a feedback mechanism a lot
it's worth noting though that not all

00:27:34.989 --> 00:27:34.999
it's worth noting though that not all
 

00:27:34.999 --> 00:27:36.940
it's worth noting though that not all
PDF viewers support adding these

00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:36.950
PDF viewers support adding these
 

00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:39.789
PDF viewers support adding these
annotations but a lot do so you know if

00:27:39.789 --> 00:27:39.799
annotations but a lot do so you know if
 

00:27:39.799 --> 00:27:41.109
annotations but a lot do so you know if
you're looking for it in your particular

00:27:41.109 --> 00:27:41.119
you're looking for it in your particular
 

00:27:41.119 --> 00:27:43.119
you're looking for it in your particular
PDF viewer you may need to switch to

00:27:43.119 --> 00:27:43.129
PDF viewer you may need to switch to
 

00:27:43.129 --> 00:27:45.509
PDF viewer you may need to switch to
another one if you can't find it yeah

00:27:45.509 --> 00:27:45.519
another one if you can't find it yeah
 

00:27:45.519 --> 00:27:48.580
another one if you can't find it yeah
and for Google Drive one of the things I

00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:48.590
and for Google Drive one of the things I
 

00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:50.139
and for Google Drive one of the things I
love by Google Drive is its commenting

00:27:50.139 --> 00:27:50.149
love by Google Drive is its commenting
 

00:27:50.149 --> 00:27:52.330
love by Google Drive is its commenting
abilities so in Doc's you can just you

00:27:52.330 --> 00:27:52.340
abilities so in Doc's you can just you
 

00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:54.669
abilities so in Doc's you can just you
know spawn a comment thread on a

00:27:54.669 --> 00:27:54.679
know spawn a comment thread on a
 

00:27:54.679 --> 00:27:57.700
know spawn a comment thread on a
specific line of feedback and then in

00:27:57.700 --> 00:27:57.710
specific line of feedback and then in
 

00:27:57.710 --> 00:27:59.980
specific line of feedback and then in
the image editor or the image viewer as

00:27:59.980 --> 00:27:59.990
the image editor or the image viewer as
 

00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:01.020
the image editor or the image viewer as
well as the

00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:01.030
well as the
 

00:28:01.030 --> 00:28:03.030
well as the
the PDF preview I believe there's a way

00:28:03.030 --> 00:28:03.040
the PDF preview I believe there's a way
 

00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:05.100
the PDF preview I believe there's a way
to kind of like highlight a certain

00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:05.110
to kind of like highlight a certain
 

00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:07.080
to kind of like highlight a certain
portion and start a comment thread on

00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:07.090
portion and start a comment thread on
 

00:28:07.090 --> 00:28:10.170
portion and start a comment thread on
like a single rectangle kind of so it's

00:28:10.170 --> 00:28:10.180
like a single rectangle kind of so it's
 

00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:11.730
like a single rectangle kind of so it's
similar to the PDF editor in the sense

00:28:11.730 --> 00:28:11.740
similar to the PDF editor in the sense
 

00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:14.480
similar to the PDF editor in the sense
that you can kind of annotate things but

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:14.490
that you can kind of annotate things but
 

00:28:14.490 --> 00:28:16.470
that you can kind of annotate things but
certainly it's you know the combination

00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:16.480
certainly it's you know the combination
 

00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:18.270
certainly it's you know the combination
of these two tools we found to be super

00:28:18.270 --> 00:28:18.280
of these two tools we found to be super
 

00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:19.560
of these two tools we found to be super
good it's nice when there's a lot of

00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:19.570
good it's nice when there's a lot of
 

00:28:19.570 --> 00:28:21.150
good it's nice when there's a lot of
back and forth when you get a few people

00:28:21.150 --> 00:28:21.160
back and forth when you get a few people
 

00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:22.980
back and forth when you get a few people
come into a particular issue will call

00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:22.990
come into a particular issue will call
 

00:28:22.990 --> 00:28:25.620
come into a particular issue will call
it yeah and the last one it's a sketch

00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:25.630
it yeah and the last one it's a sketch
 

00:28:25.630 --> 00:28:27.930
it yeah and the last one it's a sketch
so sketches you know something that

00:28:27.930 --> 00:28:27.940
so sketches you know something that
 

00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:29.760
so sketches you know something that
basically lets you annotate screenshots

00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:29.770
basically lets you annotate screenshots
 

00:28:29.770 --> 00:28:32.280
basically lets you annotate screenshots
and it's really useful for feedback on

00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:32.290
and it's really useful for feedback on
 

00:28:32.290 --> 00:28:35.280
and it's really useful for feedback on
specific photos or specific mock-ups it

00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:35.290
specific photos or specific mock-ups it
 

00:28:35.290 --> 00:28:37.500
specific photos or specific mock-ups it
doesn't it doesn't let you work with

00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:37.510
doesn't it doesn't let you work with
 

00:28:37.510 --> 00:28:39.180
doesn't it doesn't let you work with
multiple it doesn't easily let you work

00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:39.190
multiple it doesn't easily let you work
 

00:28:39.190 --> 00:28:40.890
multiple it doesn't easily let you work
with multiple things at once multiple

00:28:40.890 --> 00:28:40.900
with multiple things at once multiple
 

00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:42.320
with multiple things at once multiple
screen shots at once as far as I know

00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:42.330
screen shots at once as far as I know
 

00:28:42.330 --> 00:28:44.760
screen shots at once as far as I know
but it's certainly very useful for you

00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:44.770
but it's certainly very useful for you
 

00:28:44.770 --> 00:28:46.740
but it's certainly very useful for you
know creating arrows and annotations and

00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:46.750
know creating arrows and annotations and
 

00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:49.650
know creating arrows and annotations and
things that on top of your mock-ups so

00:28:49.650 --> 00:28:49.660
things that on top of your mock-ups so
 

00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:51.450
things that on top of your mock-ups so
these are some of the tools we use like

00:28:51.450 --> 00:28:51.460
these are some of the tools we use like
 

00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:52.800
these are some of the tools we use like
I said before we'll probably talk about

00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:52.810
I said before we'll probably talk about
 

00:28:52.810 --> 00:28:56.100
I said before we'll probably talk about
more in the future so with that let's

00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:56.110
more in the future so with that let's
 

00:28:56.110 --> 00:28:58.020
more in the future so with that let's
just quickly cover design news I think

00:28:58.020 --> 00:28:58.030
just quickly cover design news I think
 

00:28:58.030 --> 00:29:00.660
just quickly cover design news I think
we only have one item the only item is

00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:00.670
we only have one item the only item is
 

00:29:00.670 --> 00:29:04.200
we only have one item the only item is
from from Paul Burke so we mentioned i

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:04.210
from from Paul Burke so we mentioned i

think last in the last show two weeks

00:29:06.210 --> 00:29:06.220
think last in the last show two weeks
 

00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:08.070
think last in the last show two weeks
ago that there was a New York City

00:29:08.070 --> 00:29:08.080
ago that there was a New York City
 

00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:10.890

Android designers meetup went really

00:29:10.890 --> 00:29:10.900
Android designers meetup went really
 

00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:12.630
