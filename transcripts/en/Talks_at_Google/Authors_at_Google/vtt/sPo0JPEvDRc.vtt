00:00:07.141 --> 00:00:08.140
JESSICA MEGA: Excellent.

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:10.460
Thank you so much
for joining us today.

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.000
Welcome to Grand
Rounds at Verily.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.020
And today is a very
important day for us.

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.660
Today is a day to think about
our mission, which I know

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.849
drives everything that we do.

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:23.890
We know our mission is to
make the world's health

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.470
information useful
so that people

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:28.430
can enjoy healthier lives.

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:30.952
And I know that all of
us work incredibly hard,

00:00:30.952 --> 00:00:31.910
we keep our heads down.

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.240
But if we keep our
eyes on this mission,

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.980
then I think we're
ultimately going

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.320
to end up really
affecting people's lives

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.490
and make a difference that we
are trying to make every day.

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:44.830
The question is, how do we
actually achieve our mission?

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:46.810
And as I look around
the room and I

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:50.210
see all of the different
teams that come together,

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.294
this is a very special
place that's got

00:00:52.294 --> 00:00:53.710
groups of people
figuring out, how

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.800
do you collect the next
generation of information?

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.770
This information may
be digital information

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.240
and we were talking about
that earlier with Michael.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.490
It may be molecular information.

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:06.160
And we have the latest
and greatest technologies

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.870
that we can deploy.

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.580
It then becomes very important
to organize this information.

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.310
Information that
just lives in silos

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.500
doesn't actually change care.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.090
It doesn't help people.

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:17.530
And so the most
important thing is

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.720
how do we activate
this information--

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.020
get it into the hands of people,
patients, providers, and health

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.160
systems?

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.610
And if we do that, then we
will achieve our mission.

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.340
Now the reason that we're
starting Grand Rounds at Verily

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.950
is it's part of a big
effort to make sure

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.350
that we understand our users.

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.180
And it's exciting
today that we're

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.830
going to be kicking off
this particular event.

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.259
And I'll hand it over to Bill
to give you some background.

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:43.300
BILL MARKS: Thanks, Jess.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.561
Well, welcome to the inaugural
Grand Rounds at Verily.

00:01:47.561 --> 00:01:51.489
[CHEERS]

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.390
As Jess said, the
intent of these sessions

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.570
is really to connect us all
with the patients, researchers,

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.240
and clinicians that are
a part of our lives.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.270
And I know that many
of you don't always

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.690
have the opportunity to hear
from the patient's voice.

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.410
So on a quarterly basis,
we'll bring in patients

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.280
so we can hear their
real-life stories,

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.226
understand their unmet needs.

00:02:17.226 --> 00:02:18.850
And hopefully, that
will really help us

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.880
stay connected to our mission.

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.440
Each session, each quarter,
we'll have a different topic.

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.360
Today, the topic is Parkinson's
Disease and 2017 marks

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:37.570
the 200th anniversary of James
Parkinson's first description

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.820
of the disorder.

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.270
I think it's fair to say that
maybe in the next 20 years,

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.600
we may make as much progress
in Parkinson's as have

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.540
been made in the first 200.

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.570
And I think we can
contribute to that.

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:55.960
Parkinson's disease is a common
neurodegenerative disorder.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.210
It's second only to Alzheimer's
disease in prevalence.

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:01.150
It affects about a million
Americans, 10 million people

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.490
worldwide.

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:06.130
Most people think of Parkinson's
disease as a movement

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.380
disorder-- problems
with slowness

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.280
of movement, stiffness
of muscles, shaking,

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.740
difficulty with
gait and balance.

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:16.720
But it's really a
multi-system disorder

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.850
that affects so
much more and causes

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.070
many symptoms for patients.

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:23.200
Difficulty regulating
blood pressure,

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.280
difficulty with sleep,
depression, anxiety,

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.140
gastrointestinal issues,
and many other issues.

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.850
So it really is a
multi-system disease.

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.330
And I think one that we're up to
the challenge of tackling here

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.610
at verily.

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:42.160
Many of you are aware
of our emerging efforts

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.920
in Parkinson's, but
I wanted to highlight

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.770
why Parkinson's disease
makes sense for us

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:51.190
to care about and work on.

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.230
Certainly, there are
still knowledge gaps,

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.120
as I think you'll
hear from our guests,

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.220
that we can really help fill--

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.530
characterizing the
disease better,

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.380
understanding how we measure
the progression of the disease

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.480
or the response to treatments.

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.920
And we can all
contribute to that.

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.000
And as we study this disease,
it will simultaneously

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.850
help us build out
our capabilities

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:16.750
in systems biology, in
wearable sensors, in algorithm

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:18.950
development, and so forth.

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:21.920
So it's really quite a
nice match for our mission.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:26.140
I think some of the specific
programs that we have--

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:27.610
just so you're aware--

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.090
the new Study
Watch is being used

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:33.850
in our Parkinson's
study in the Netherlands

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:36.610
and perhaps, in other
studies to come.

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.570
We think this will be very
useful for tracking movement

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:42.700
and function during
the patient's

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:46.310
normal daily activities.

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:48.100
We also have
Liftware, of course.

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.620
And Liftware can be
useful to cancel out

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.670
tremor that may interfere
with feeding from Parkinsonian

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:55.660
tremor.

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.030
And now the Liftware
steady device

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.000
can help dyskinesia, the
involuntary movements

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.940
that medication can cause
in Parkinson's disease.

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.000
And then the
Parkinson [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.410
that's the Dutch version of
the Personalized Parkinson

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:14.170
Project, which is our
longitudinal cohort

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:16.270
study that we're kicking
off in the Netherlands,

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:18.940
with the goal of
really understanding

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:25.330
in a deep way what Parkinson's
is to advance treatments.

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:30.070
So I think a very interesting
and important disorder

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:31.510
that we care about.

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:37.390
And we are extremely excited to
have members of the Michael J.

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:43.330
Fox Foundation to help us better
understand Parkinson's disease

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:45.400
and learn what
it's like, in terms

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:49.210
of the impact on daily life.

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:51.820
For those who are not familiar
with the Michael J. Fox

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:56.650
Foundation for Parkinson's
Research, in its short history,

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:59.410
they say the only constant
of the organization

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:02.500
has been its unflagging
commitment to finding

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:07.330
a cure for Parkinson's disease
and put itself out of business.

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:10.480
Michael was saying earlier that
he wanted to go into business

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:14.020
to go out of business.

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:15.880
They launched the
foundation in 2000.

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:19.510
It quickly grew from a
startup to the world's largest

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:22.240
nonprofit funder of
Parkinson's drug development.

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:25.180
They've allocated
more than $700 million

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:29.350
since the inception
of the organization.

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:31.690
"The New York Times" has
called the foundation

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:34.690
the most credible voice
on Parkinson's research

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:38.590
in the world and it's
widely being considered

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:40.570
at the forefront of innovation.

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:43.720
They've established a
peer-level group of neuroscience

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:46.420
who prioritize, manage, and
troubleshoot their research

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:47.770
portfolio.

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:51.310
And they are sponsoring
a landmark biomarker

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:54.100
study called PPMI.

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:56.950
Most recently, the
Foundation has also

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:59.890
formally integrated policy
and advocacy into their work,

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:01.130
as well.

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:03.899
So a very impressive
organization.

00:07:03.899 --> 00:07:06.190
I've had the privilege of
working with them pretty much

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:08.500
since their inception.

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:10.150
Well, let's bring
out our guests.

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:12.820
Actually, our first guest
is already in the audience.

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:17.117
Debi Brooks is the
co-founder of the Foundation.

00:07:17.117 --> 00:07:18.700
Michael's employee
number one, I think

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:22.870
they call you, and presently,
the Executive Vice Chairman

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:23.900
of the organization.

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:25.855
Let's have round of
applause for Debi.

00:07:25.855 --> 00:07:29.815
[APPLAUSE]

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:35.580
And then we're going to bring
to the stage Todd Sherer.

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:39.990
Todd is the Chief Executive
Officer of the Foundation.

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:43.950
Todd is formally trained
as a neuroscientist

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:46.980
and he now directs the
organization's research

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:48.590
strategy, as well.

00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:51.570
He's responsible, of course,
for the overall scientific and

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:53.300
fundraising efforts.

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:54.324
Todd, great to see you.

00:07:54.324 --> 00:07:56.282
I think we're going to
have you sit over there.

00:07:56.282 --> 00:07:59.686
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:00.186 --> 00:08:03.390
Now, Todd and I go back a
ways, but the cool thing,

00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:05.790
that I didn't realize
until I read your bio,

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:10.740
is that you received a grant
from the Foundation in 2003.

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:12.840
And so he was a grant
recipient and then

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:15.870
came in-house to
gradually assume

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:17.670
increasing
responsibilities and now,

00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:19.380
is the CEO of the organization.

00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:20.620
So great to have you here.

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:22.350
TODD SHERER: Thanks, Bill.

00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:26.782
BILL MARKS: And then, our very
special guest, Michael J. Fox.

00:08:26.782 --> 00:08:30.710
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:49.810
It does seem a little
superfluous for me

00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:51.220
to provide a formal
introduction,

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:53.230
but I will provide
a very brief one.

00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:57.010
As you know, he is an
actor, producer, and author.

00:08:57.010 --> 00:08:59.290
And of course, an advocate.

00:08:59.290 --> 00:09:03.880
They say you burst onto the
scenes with iconic roles--

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:07.030
Alex P. Keaton from
NBC'S "Family Ties,"

00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:10.950
Marty McFly in the "Back
to the Future" trilogy,

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:15.910
and he's continued
to thrill audiences

00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:20.380
as recently as "The Good Wife,"
with his portrayal of Louis

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:21.420
Canning.

00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:23.290
But he's also a
best-selling author

00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:24.687
and he's written three books.

00:09:24.687 --> 00:09:25.270
Is that right?

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:26.050
Three?

00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:26.380
MICHAEL J. FOX: Three.

00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:27.040
Two and a half.

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:28.248
BILL MARKS: Three and a half.

00:09:28.248 --> 00:09:30.010
MICHAEL J. FOX: Two and a half.

00:09:30.010 --> 00:09:35.290
BILL MARKS: "Lucky Man, A
Memoir," "Always Looking Up,

00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:38.417
The Adventures of an
Incurable Optimist,"

00:09:38.417 --> 00:09:40.000
and "A Funny Thing
Happened on the Way

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.980
to the Future, Twists and
Turns and Lessons Learned."

00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:46.990
I think you can tell a lot
just about the focus there.

00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:50.230
He was diagnosed with
Parkinson's in 1991

00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:54.340
at the age of 29, and
disclosed his condition

00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:57.430
to the public in 1998.

00:09:57.430 --> 00:10:00.430
Ultimately, went on to fund
the Foundation in 2000.

00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:03.523
So warm welcome, again,
for Todd and Michael.

00:10:03.523 --> 00:10:06.974
[APPLAUSE]

00:10:12.494 --> 00:10:13.910
Thanks to you both
for being here.

00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:19.210
It's really kind of you to
come and help our employees

00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:20.620
understand Parkinson's disease.

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:21.210
You know--

00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:21.940
MICHAEL J. FOX: I'm
honored to be here.

00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:22.580
I just want to say--

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:23.670
I've said to couple of people.

00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:26.085
But I always think when I'm
with a group like this, I think,

00:10:26.085 --> 00:10:27.626
your parents must
be so disappointed.

00:10:27.626 --> 00:10:30.320
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:30.824 --> 00:10:31.740
You've become nothing.

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:32.746
You've become--

00:10:32.746 --> 00:10:34.870
BILL MARKS: Well, you know
what's been interesting,

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:38.440
Michael, is when word leaked out
that you might be visiting us,

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:41.020
I had a number of
people come up to me

00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:44.650
and tell me that you were
their hero, their idol.

00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:47.590
And I had to sort of smile
because as a neurologist,

00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:51.756
taking care of Parkinson's
patients for the last 20 years,

00:10:51.756 --> 00:10:53.130
they feel the same
way about you.

00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:56.120
That you've been
their hero and idol.

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:58.390
And I just wonder, did
you ever think you'd

00:10:58.390 --> 00:11:00.670
be in that kind of a role?

00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:02.560
MICHAEL J. FOX: No.

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:03.700
I didn't think--

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:05.100
I didn't see it through.

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:07.090
It's kind of like when
I got into acting,

00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:10.310
it just was a thing that
felt good to me, so I did it.

00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:11.710
And it turned out.

00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:13.194
But when I found--

00:11:13.194 --> 00:11:14.860
when I was diagnosed
with Parkinson's, I

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:16.430
didn't-- my first thought
wasn't other people.

00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:18.400
My first thought was, what
the hell happened to me?

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:19.316
What am I going to do?

00:11:19.316 --> 00:11:22.970
And it took about seven years
for me to work that all out.

00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:26.290
And then what happened
was, once I accepted that--

00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:28.826
and I've said to people
that acceptance is--

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:33.190
my happiness grows
in direct proportion

00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:37.110
to my acceptance and inverse
proportion to my expectation.

00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:39.250
If I could just accept
what my situation is,

00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:42.380
then I can nuance it and
I can be honest about it

00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:44.080
and I can move forward.

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:47.110
And also, I became
part of a community.

00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:49.330
And then there were
other people that

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:51.100
were in the same
situation I was and they

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:54.120
had thoughts and feelings
that were similar to mine.

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:57.486
And goals and hopes that
were similar to mine.

00:11:57.486 --> 00:11:59.110
And I just thought,
the only difference

00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:01.290
is I'm in this unique position.

00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:02.890
I'm in this position
where people

00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:06.310
know me and have a
predisposition towards me,

00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:07.960
whether it's good or bad.

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:10.490
Mostly good, which was nice.

00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:13.220
And so I said, I have
an opportunity here.

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:15.934
And I kind of have a
responsibility here

00:12:15.934 --> 00:12:16.600
to do something.

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:19.940
And so the foundation was born.

00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:22.720
But the gratitude that
you say that people

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:25.370
express toward me
and those feelings,

00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:26.660
they're completely mutual.

00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:30.230
I mean, I'm so
inspired by people

00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:33.490
that have this in they're in
a tougher position than I am

00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:35.500
and they deal with it daily.

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:38.590
And I feel honored that
they've entrusted me

00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:44.157
with their hopes and their
dreams of being rescued.

00:12:44.157 --> 00:12:46.490
BILL MARKS: Well, you've
already gotten pretty personal.

00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:48.540
And I wanted to go
back in time to--

00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:50.252
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:54.586
--back to the first symptoms.

00:12:54.586 --> 00:12:55.710
What were you experiencing?

00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:57.876
MICHAEL J. FOX: Well, I was
doing a movie in Florida

00:12:57.876 --> 00:12:58.970
called "Doc Hollywood."

00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:01.048
And I was--

00:13:01.048 --> 00:13:04.970
I woke up in the morning
and had a twitching pinky.

00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:09.015
And I-- I was out that night
before with Woody Harrelson,

00:13:09.015 --> 00:13:09.890
who was in the movie.

00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:11.014
And that's always bad news.

00:13:11.014 --> 00:13:12.354
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:12.354 --> 00:13:14.020
And so we kind of
ripped up Gainesville.

00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:15.160
We were in a college town.

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:19.189
With Woody Harrelson in a
college town, it's just so bad.

00:13:19.189 --> 00:13:21.730
But I woke up the next morning
and I had this twitching pinky

00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:23.980
and I couldn't stop it.

00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:25.520
It just kept twitching.

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:29.860
And so I went to a
neurologist on campus--

00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:30.820
BILL MARKS: Right away.

00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:31.210
MICHAEL J. FOX: Yeah.

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:32.043
I went the next day.

00:13:32.043 --> 00:13:33.850
Did you see what I--

00:13:33.850 --> 00:13:36.670
because I thought
I hit my ulna or--

00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:38.810
and he said-- the guy
said it was thoracic--

00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:41.850
my thoracic-- that
it was some pull.

00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:44.740
And he completely
missed the boat.

00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:49.700
But there's no symptoms with
early onset that really tell

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:53.080
you-- and a 29-year-old guy,
he's not thinking Parkinson's.

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:55.685
So then, about a year later--

00:13:55.685 --> 00:13:57.020
it was about a year later--

00:13:57.020 --> 00:13:58.690
BILL MARKS: A year later.

00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:01.150
MICHAEL J. FOX: --I found
myself at a neurologist's office

00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:02.983
because I'd gone to a
physical therapist who

00:14:02.983 --> 00:14:04.890
said this is neurological.

00:14:04.890 --> 00:14:07.355
So I went to a neurologist's
office and he--

00:14:07.355 --> 00:14:09.060
I did the battery of tests.

00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:12.730
I mean, still today, we
haven't got a biomarker--

00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:15.850
we haven't got a way to identify
it so you do this drunk driving

00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:17.900
test, which I failed.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.090
And then he sat me down.

00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:23.896
He said, you have Parkinson's.

00:14:23.896 --> 00:14:28.630
You have Parkinson's disease and
you have 10 years left to work.

00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:30.460
And it was just, wham.

00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:32.370
And it took me a long time to--

00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:34.720
I mean, I remember going
outside, leaving the doctor's

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:38.270
office, and it was just
this rainy day in New York.

00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:41.215
And I just went, what
the hell just happened?

00:14:41.215 --> 00:14:41.909
And I even had--

00:14:41.909 --> 00:14:42.700
I have to confess--

00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:46.580
I had feelings like,
don't you know who I am?

00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:48.740
You can't be pronounce
that I have Parkinson's.

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:51.000
That's not in the script.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.630
And so that was the
beginning of my journey.

00:14:54.630 --> 00:14:57.015
BILL MARKS: Must have been
a stunning thing to hear.

00:14:57.015 --> 00:14:58.640
MICHAEL J. FOX: It
was pretty shocking.

00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:01.070
And I told my wife--

00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:02.730
I came home and told my wife.

00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:05.667
And it was just like--

00:15:05.667 --> 00:15:07.000
we had a young son, who was two.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.340
He's 27 now.

00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:10.970
But he was really young.

00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:14.090
And we just didn't know
what the future held.

00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:20.680
But I've always been,
if not optimistic,

00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:22.800
I tend to look at
things positively.

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:24.930
And I knew that there
was something in there.

00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:27.500
All the way along
the first few years,

00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:29.270
I knew that there
was something to--

00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:31.920
that this was-- there's
possibility in here

00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:36.876
and there was opportunity
to change the way

00:15:36.876 --> 00:15:40.760
I looked at things, at the
very least, in adapting to it.

00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:42.399
And something good
might come of that.

00:15:42.399 --> 00:15:44.690
BILL MARKS: Were you treated
with meditation right away

00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:45.600
once the diagnosis was given?

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:47.225
MICHAEL J. FOX: I
was given medication,

00:15:47.225 --> 00:15:48.770
but I treated it like Smarties.

00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:50.940
I'd just throw it in my pocket.

00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:53.075
If I was feeling
twitchy, I'd pop a pill.

00:15:53.075 --> 00:15:57.250
And I really did it haphazardly
and had dyskinesia as a result.

00:15:57.250 --> 00:15:58.967
I had big swaying movements.

00:15:58.967 --> 00:16:00.050
BILL MARKS: Even early on?

00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:01.250
MICHAEL J. FOX: Yeah.

00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:03.950
From the drugs because
I was taking too much.

00:16:03.950 --> 00:16:07.239
Because I didn't educate
myself about the disease.

00:16:07.239 --> 00:16:08.780
And then about four
or five years in,

00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:11.140
I started to really
talk to my doctor

00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:16.420
and I kind of went,
this isn't going away.

00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:18.066
I haven't changed
toothpaste and all

00:16:18.066 --> 00:16:19.440
of a sudden been
better and gone,

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:22.170
oh, it was the
toothpaste all along.

00:16:22.170 --> 00:16:25.550
It was-- I knew that
I was in it and I

00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:27.300
had to educate myself about it.

00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:27.800
So I did.

00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:29.175
And so that brought
me to a place

00:16:29.175 --> 00:16:31.430
where before I started
the foundation,

00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:36.440
I was in Washington testifying
about the need for funding.

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:38.995
And I talked to doctors who
said the science is ahead

00:16:38.995 --> 00:16:40.060
of the money.

00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:42.660
They kept saying to me, the
science is ahead of the money.

00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:43.640
And I thought, well,
that's what I'm going to--

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:45.260
I'll chase the science.

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:47.420
It was kind of a flip
on the Watergate thing.

00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:49.830
It's not follow the
science, follow the money.

00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:52.890
And the money will
follow the science.

00:16:52.890 --> 00:16:55.790
And so that got into
my head and I just

00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:59.480
knew that I needed to
treat this like a business

00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:02.750
and treat it like--

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:04.700
our goal was to go
out of business.

00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:07.967
And we need to look at it from
a scientific point of view,

00:17:07.967 --> 00:17:10.550
from a business point of view,
from an academic point of view,

00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:12.349
from a patient point of view.

00:17:12.349 --> 00:17:15.440
And we managed to do that.

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:17.640
BILL MARKS: Before
you went public,

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:20.060
you had a thalamotomy, right?

00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:20.940
MICHAEL J. FOX: Yeah.

00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:22.440
Yeah, before I went public.

00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:26.180
BILL MARKS: And a
thalamotomy is a very precise

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:28.850
therapeutic lesioning procedure
of the area of the brain that's

00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:29.840
generating the tremor.

00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:33.170
MICHAEL J. FOX: It's 20th
century [? tripponing. ?]

00:17:33.170 --> 00:17:35.120
BILL MARKS: How did
you decide to do that?

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:37.690
MICHAEL J. FOX: I had huge
symptoms on my left side.

00:17:37.690 --> 00:17:39.779
And I was doing a show
called "Spin City"

00:17:39.779 --> 00:17:41.320
and I was finding
myself doing scenes

00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:44.910
where I was sitting on my hand
because it just wouldn't stop.

00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:45.900
And it just was--

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:47.761
I mean, everything I did was--

00:17:47.761 --> 00:17:49.260
I was acting and I
was doing my job,

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:52.070
but I was involved
in misdirection

00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:55.250
and sleight of hand
and just finding ways

00:17:55.250 --> 00:17:59.240
to lean on desks and to--

00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:03.770
because my tremor, if I did
something, it would rest.

00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:05.470
So if I moved this--

00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:08.120
so I would be doing a
scene and I would just

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:11.570
do that for no reason.

00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:12.407
And so I thought--

00:18:12.407 --> 00:18:14.240
I talked to some
neurologists and they said,

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:17.330
we can diminish the
tremor on that side

00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:21.345
by doing a small incision
in your thalamus, which

00:18:21.345 --> 00:18:23.480
is called a thalamotomy.

00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:25.144
So I did it and it worked.

00:18:25.144 --> 00:18:26.060
BILL MARKS: It helped?

00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:28.370
MICHAEL J. FOX: But then it
started on my right side.

00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:30.830
So I wasn't going
to go back in again.

00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:34.760
And it was a stopgap
measure that--

00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:36.530
I don't know that I
would do it again.

00:18:36.530 --> 00:18:39.150
But I don't resent the
fact that I did it.

00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:42.490
I don't resent the doctors that
did it and I don't regret it.

00:18:42.490 --> 00:18:44.114
But I wouldn't do it again.

00:18:44.114 --> 00:18:45.280
Because if you're going to--

00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:47.030
I mean, the next time
they go to my brain,

00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:49.030
they're going to
have it figured out.

00:18:49.030 --> 00:18:50.780
BILL MARKS: Todd,
you're a neuroscientist.

00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:55.310
How did you become interested in
working on Parkinson's disease?

00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:58.310
TODD SHERER: I was fooled into
working on Parkinson's disease

00:18:58.310 --> 00:19:02.330
because at the time, when
I was in graduate school,

00:19:02.330 --> 00:19:04.790
and still one of the common
theories in Parkinson's is

00:19:04.790 --> 00:19:07.580
that there's really
a selective loss

00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:10.010
of a very specific
population of cells

00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:12.800
in the brain that produce
dopamine in the substantia

00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:14.370
nigra.

00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:16.380
And at the time
of diagnosis, it's

00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:19.110
believed that already
80% or so of those cells

00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:23.310
have degenerated, before
the symptoms start.

00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:25.420
So as a naive graduate
student, I thought, well,

00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:28.470
it wouldn't be so hard to
just save 10% of these cells

00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:30.590
and then we'd have
cured Parkinson's.

00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:33.510
And of course, we know it's
much more complicated than that.

00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:38.420
But just the academic challenge
of that drew me into this.

00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:40.740
It seems to me a
very solvable disease

00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:43.395
if we can push the science
and fund the right science.

00:19:43.395 --> 00:19:45.270
BILL MARKS: And so you
were a grant recipient

00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:47.680
of the foundation just a
few years into its creation.

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:50.889
And then how did you
end up becoming staff?

00:19:50.889 --> 00:19:52.680
TODD SHERER: It's really
hard being a grant

00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:53.970
recipient of the foundation.

00:19:53.970 --> 00:19:55.720
It's much easier
being the grant giver.

00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:57.270
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:57.270 --> 00:19:59.820
But actually, one of the
things that really impressed me

00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:02.910
when I had my grant was that
the foundation is very focused

00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:04.410
on accountability.

00:20:04.410 --> 00:20:07.530
And having a fellowship
from the foundation,

00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:10.350
I still had to come in and
report on what I actually

00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:12.900
used the money for, which
is not actually that common

00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:15.020
in the granting industry.

00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:16.770
And what was really
exciting about that is

00:20:16.770 --> 00:20:20.520
I actually got to meet the
other grant recipients.

00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:23.160
And it really
improved my research

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:27.750
and it developed this network
and I got access to new tools.

00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:31.140
And it got me really excited
about this new way of funding

00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:33.660
and pushing research forward.

00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:36.150
And at that time, when Michael
and Debi were expanding

00:20:36.150 --> 00:20:40.250
the activities to look to
bring on internal scientists,

00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:42.480
to have that opportunity
to have this broad impact

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:45.180
across the whole disease,
rather than just be focusing

00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:48.120
on your one molecule
of your one project,

00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:51.100
was really exciting to me.

00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:54.130
BILL MARKS: Michael, can
you describe a typical day

00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:56.820
with Parkinson's disease,
if there is such a thing?

00:20:56.820 --> 00:20:59.830
MICHAEL J. FOX: Well, I
don't have any typical days.

00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:06.020
In general, I don't go to work
in the same place every day.

00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:08.000
So I never know what to
expect on any given day

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.930
and I might have commitments
or responsibilities

00:21:10.930 --> 00:21:14.442
and I'll titrate my
medication according

00:21:14.442 --> 00:21:15.650
to what I want to have to do.

00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:18.850
I don't take pills
at 9:00 and at 11:30.

00:21:18.850 --> 00:21:20.960
I have areas that I--

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:22.959
and some days, I feel better.

00:21:22.959 --> 00:21:25.000
I mean, I come to California,
I feel a lot better

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:26.000
than I feel in New York.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.440
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:32.640
High pressure is better
for me than low pressure.

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:34.240
Humidity is tough for me.

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:36.050
If I eat protein,
it's tough for me.

00:21:36.050 --> 00:21:38.890
So I'm always doing
different things.

00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:44.091
But a typical day is I
get up and I literally--

00:21:44.091 --> 00:21:45.590
someone once said
to me that it used

00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:47.750
to be the hero's journey
was to slay the dragon

00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:49.220
and save the princess.

00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:51.200
But for me, the
hero's journey is

00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:54.200
putting one foot in front of the
other and getting out of bed.

00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:56.090
And literally, since
I've had this problem

00:21:56.090 --> 00:22:02.714
with gait and with falling, I
literally get up and think, OK.

00:22:02.714 --> 00:22:03.920
[GRUNTS]

00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:08.940
And it's-- again, you look
at things differently.

00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:11.000
And I look at that as
an incredible gift.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.020
I look at that as--

00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:18.810
to live that metaphor is so
rewarding and enlightening

00:22:18.810 --> 00:22:21.371
and it just opens
you up to everything.

00:22:21.371 --> 00:22:23.120
Because it really is
about that step and I

00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:24.661
don't know what to
expect after that.

00:22:24.661 --> 00:22:29.530
I could go head into the
toilet and crack my head open.

00:22:29.530 --> 00:22:30.590
So that's a possibility.

00:22:30.590 --> 00:22:33.210
And the next moment, I get
through it and I don't do that.

00:22:33.210 --> 00:22:34.325
Then that's a success.

00:22:34.325 --> 00:22:36.480
I can build on that.

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:44.000
And my day is-- a typical day is
just building on relationships

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.814
and being open to my family
and how they react to it.

00:22:46.814 --> 00:22:48.480
And realizing that
it affects them, too.

00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:54.890
And again, this feeling that--
and this understanding that no

00:22:54.890 --> 00:22:56.550
one dies from Parkinson's.

00:22:56.550 --> 00:22:57.930
You die with Parkinson's.

00:22:57.930 --> 00:23:02.140
And so I'm living
with Parkinson's.

00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:04.490
And my family's
living with it, too.

00:23:04.490 --> 00:23:08.956
And so I respond
to how they react.

00:23:08.956 --> 00:23:10.330
And I respond to
how I'm feeling.

00:23:10.330 --> 00:23:23.060
And it's why this work is so
rewarding because it gives me

00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:28.460
a feeling of usefulness and that
I'm doing something productive.

00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:31.190
BILL MARKS: It's really common
for people with Parkinson's

00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:33.590
to talk about how difficult
it is in the morning

00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:36.260
since they have gone all
night without medication.

00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:37.850
Do you find you can
count on your meds

00:23:37.850 --> 00:23:39.410
once you have taken them?

00:23:39.410 --> 00:23:40.284
MICHAEL J. FOX: Yeah.

00:23:40.284 --> 00:23:43.200
But I like-- I play this
game of keep-away with them.

00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:47.180
I like to forestall
it as long as I can.

00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:47.930
But--

00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:49.050
BILL MARKS: Why is that?

00:23:49.050 --> 00:23:50.870
MICHAEL J. FOX: Just
because it'll go--

00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:53.900
because if I can bump up--

00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:57.156
if I don't have to take it at
8:00 and I take it at 9:30,

00:23:57.156 --> 00:23:58.780
then I don't have to
take it till 2:00.

00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:00.071
Then I'm good into the evening.

00:24:02.730 --> 00:24:03.860
It's funny to be--

00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:06.240
I try not to be
a prisoner to it.

00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:09.192
I try to be--

00:24:09.192 --> 00:24:12.582
to have it be a
living relationship

00:24:12.582 --> 00:24:14.050
between me and my treatment.

00:24:14.050 --> 00:24:18.290
That we-- it's give and take.

00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:19.779
And you play games that--

00:24:19.779 --> 00:24:21.320
I was saying to
someone earlier, when

00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:25.640
I go to my doctor's and my
movement disorder specialist,

00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:30.200
she's doing-- this kind of
comes in with this information

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:33.410
devices that you
guys are working on.

00:24:33.410 --> 00:24:37.180
I go in and she has a list of
questions about how I'm doing.

00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:41.320
And she has a graph
from zero to five.

00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:44.100
So I instinctively want
to get those zeros, which

00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:46.474
means I don't have the symptom
that she's talking about.

00:24:46.474 --> 00:24:48.140
BILL MARKS: Typical
overachiever, right?

00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:49.931
MICHAEL J. FOX: But I
do have the symptoms.

00:24:49.931 --> 00:24:51.290
But I say--

00:24:51.290 --> 00:24:53.780
I meet up so I'm
really in good shape

00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:55.260
and I do my walking really well.

00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:57.650
And I do all my
stuff really well.

00:24:57.650 --> 00:24:59.460
And she's like, you're great.

00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:02.011
And I'm like, not really.

00:25:02.011 --> 00:25:02.510
But--

00:25:02.510 --> 00:25:04.009
BILL MARKS: And
this is a key point.

00:25:04.009 --> 00:25:05.880
What you're pointing
out is the snapshot

00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:08.130
that the doctor gets in the
office doesn't necessarily

00:25:08.130 --> 00:25:09.140
reflect what's going on.

00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:09.270
MICHAEL J. FOX: Yeah, exactly.

00:25:09.270 --> 00:25:10.690
It's anecdotal.

00:25:10.690 --> 00:25:14.390
And we are, in many
ways, the best reporters

00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:16.010
of our situation,
of our condition.

00:25:16.010 --> 00:25:17.968
But in other ways, we're
not because we're just

00:25:17.968 --> 00:25:20.630
pure humanity, human
instinct, to want

00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:23.330
to be the best you can
be at any given moment.

00:25:23.330 --> 00:25:26.570
So the idea that
there's a device

00:25:26.570 --> 00:25:28.430
that you can just
hand to your doctor

00:25:28.430 --> 00:25:32.210
and he or she gets the
complete rundown of what

00:25:32.210 --> 00:25:34.460
your day, your week,
your month has been,

00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:37.760
how your movement is
responding to medication,

00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:43.370
how much rest you need.

00:25:43.370 --> 00:25:51.660
It's an amazing thought that
you can turn your experience

00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:58.220
into information that helps
people that are in a position

00:25:58.220 --> 00:25:59.580
to do something about it.

00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:00.170
BILL MARKS: Question for you.

00:26:00.170 --> 00:26:02.461
People may notice a little
bit of the writhing movement

00:26:02.461 --> 00:26:04.000
that you have, the dyskinesia.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:09.430
Can you comment on what that's
like and what it's all about?

00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:13.130
MICHAEL J. FOX: Moments when
you're the focus of attention,

00:26:13.130 --> 00:26:14.900
it gets you twitchy.

00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:19.107
So it's just a reaction
to the medication.

00:26:19.107 --> 00:26:20.940
There's something--
there's this drug that I

00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:23.850
take called amantadine,
which is a [? found ?] drug.

00:26:23.850 --> 00:26:26.690
There are many drugs
that treat diseases

00:26:26.690 --> 00:26:31.580
that don't have cures
or therapies that

00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:34.360
pretty much resemble a cure.

00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:37.880
And so amantaine was a drug that
was used for old people that

00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:39.140
had the flu.

00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:41.880
And it happens to
diminish dyskinesia,

00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:45.470
but it's harsh on you.

00:26:45.470 --> 00:26:48.756
After a while, you see
spiders in the corner,

00:26:48.756 --> 00:26:51.880
stuff moving that isn't there.

00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:53.660
So it's a trade-off
with everything.

00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:56.180
You try to do as little
of that as possible.

00:26:56.180 --> 00:26:58.520
I could get myself
still, but it would

00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:01.902
be at the expense of my
articulation and my--

00:27:01.902 --> 00:27:03.860
BILL MARKS: Todd, I think
Michael's bringing up

00:27:03.860 --> 00:27:07.730
one of the clinical issues,
the motor fluctuation,

00:27:07.730 --> 00:27:10.730
the trying to balance the
good function without being

00:27:10.730 --> 00:27:13.559
too slow or too dyskinetic.

00:27:13.559 --> 00:27:15.100
Are there efforts
that the foundation

00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:17.540
has supported to try
to help with some

00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:19.370
of these day-to-day
symptomatic needs?

00:27:19.370 --> 00:27:21.770
TODD SHERER: Yeah There's
a lot of research going on

00:27:21.770 --> 00:27:22.470
in this area.

00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:24.890
One of the main
areas is to just see

00:27:24.890 --> 00:27:28.970
if we can get a better standard
delivery of the medication.

00:27:28.970 --> 00:27:30.470
Michael was talking
before about how

00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:33.560
he's trying to time his
medication throughout the day

00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:35.690
to have the optimal benefit.

00:27:35.690 --> 00:27:37.520
But there's a lot of
research to just try

00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:40.070
to see if you could
reformulate the medication,

00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:43.880
either with a patch delivery
or more rapid onset delivery,

00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:47.060
just so you can get a more
continuous, consistent,

00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:48.590
more predictable day.

00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:50.700
And a lot of that is
driven by the disease,

00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:54.530
but also by how your body
is handling this medication.

00:27:54.530 --> 00:27:56.300
BILL MARKS: One
comment that Michael

00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:57.990
made was repurposing drugs.

00:27:57.990 --> 00:28:00.260
And I think it's been
really brilliant, what

00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:03.110
one of your programs has done,
if you want to describe that.

00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:03.860
TODD SHERER: Yeah.

00:28:03.860 --> 00:28:06.500
This is a big effort not just
in Parkinson's, but an effort

00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:08.450
we've focused on,
which is there's

00:28:08.450 --> 00:28:11.150
a lot of commonalities
in the underlying

00:28:11.150 --> 00:28:13.990
biological mechanisms
across disease.

00:28:13.990 --> 00:28:17.110
And you could take advantage
of some of the innovations that

00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:20.770
have been made to develop
molecules or compounds in other

00:28:20.770 --> 00:28:23.770
diseases and now apply and
test them in Parkinson's.

00:28:23.770 --> 00:28:25.660
Right now, there's
a large trial going

00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:28.120
on looking at blood
pressure medication

00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:29.770
as actually a treatment
for Parkinson's

00:28:29.770 --> 00:28:32.020
because the same
calcium channels are

00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:34.220
involved in the nervous system.

00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:35.490
So there's a lot of efforts.

00:28:35.490 --> 00:28:37.573
The whole point of this
is to try to short circuit

00:28:37.573 --> 00:28:40.450
some of the slowness of the
drug development pipeline

00:28:40.450 --> 00:28:42.610
and take advantage of
existing treatments

00:28:42.610 --> 00:28:44.210
and apply them to the disease.

00:28:44.210 --> 00:28:46.085
BILL MARKS: And Michael,
was that your intent

00:28:46.085 --> 00:28:49.510
in creating the foundation,
to find new drugs

00:28:49.510 --> 00:28:52.170
or find a cure or all the above?

00:28:52.170 --> 00:28:56.340
MICHAEL J. FOX: It started
out to find a cure.

00:28:56.340 --> 00:28:59.290
We realized that there were
no pathways to the cure.

00:28:59.290 --> 00:29:03.830
There's all kinds of silos, but
there are very few throughways,

00:29:03.830 --> 00:29:05.200
pipelines.

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:10.240
And so as we evolved,
we found ourselves

00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:14.170
with a whole new issue, which
is finding drugs and therapies,

00:29:14.170 --> 00:29:17.020
improving what was
there, and incentivizing

00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:19.300
drug companies to take us on.

00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:24.560
Because at a million, we're
a relatively small population

00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:30.580
of sufferers or
people that have it.

00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:36.620
And so we have a
drug company and we'd

00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:38.440
say we're working on
a compound [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:43.800
and we'd give a multibillion
dollar corporation $5 million

00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:47.770
to keep their eye on the ball.

00:29:47.770 --> 00:29:51.780
And then we, in some situations,
we had a big follow-on funding,

00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:53.710
once those results were good.

00:29:53.710 --> 00:29:56.140
And it was just that--

00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:58.540
I credit these guys with
it, who came up with it.

00:29:58.540 --> 00:30:01.610
And it's been amazing,
our relationship

00:30:01.610 --> 00:30:06.130
with pharma, who I always kind
of thought of as bad guys.

00:30:06.130 --> 00:30:09.190
But we found a way to work with
them and have good results.

00:30:11.617 --> 00:30:13.450
BILL MARKS: Have the
goals of the foundation

00:30:13.450 --> 00:30:15.520
changed from when you
first envisioned it

00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:17.470
to what you think
is important now,

00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:19.440
or do you feel there's
a certain constancy?

00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:21.231
MICHAEL J. FOX: Well,
I just didn't think--

00:30:21.231 --> 00:30:23.590
I didn't see that we
would do so much--

00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:31.470
just finding new
ways to approach it.

00:30:31.470 --> 00:30:34.380
I thought it was, you find
scientists and you fund them.

00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:35.520
But it's bigger than that.

00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:38.070
It's finding
scientists and knowing

00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:39.645
what you want from them.

00:30:39.645 --> 00:30:41.270
And that's one of
the reasons that they

00:30:41.270 --> 00:30:44.015
talk about accountability.

00:30:44.015 --> 00:30:46.135
I remember saying
in early meetings,

00:30:46.135 --> 00:30:47.760
we're going to give
this guy $2 million

00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:51.342
and he's not going to come
and tell us what he's doing?

00:30:51.342 --> 00:30:52.800
I wanted to give
him a report card.

00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:59.340
I want to withhold funding if
it's not going in the direction

00:30:59.340 --> 00:31:01.529
that we expected.

00:31:01.529 --> 00:31:03.570
BILL MARKS: So this
philosophy came from the top,

00:31:03.570 --> 00:31:04.625
it sounds like.

00:31:04.625 --> 00:31:06.000
MICHAEL J. FOX:
Well, I kind of--

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.420
I'm like Chauncey
Gardiner and being there,

00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:10.295
I just kind of spout.

00:31:13.710 --> 00:31:14.350
No endowment.

00:31:14.350 --> 00:31:16.654
Money comes in, money goes out.

00:31:16.654 --> 00:31:20.650
Just like little
[INAUDIBLE] and the debt

00:31:20.650 --> 00:31:22.127
translates into policy.

00:31:22.127 --> 00:31:23.710
BILL MARKS: Yeah,
this is fascinating.

00:31:23.710 --> 00:31:25.750
So you said money comes
in, money goes out.

00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:26.890
There is no endowment.

00:31:26.890 --> 00:31:29.080
You raise the money each
year and you spend it.

00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:31.121
MICHAEL J. FOX: Yeah,
that's what it's there for.

00:31:33.460 --> 00:31:35.580
We don't want to sit
on a pile of money.

00:31:35.580 --> 00:31:38.140
It's not doing anybody any good.

00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:39.610
So it goes in, it goes out.

00:31:39.610 --> 00:31:42.002
And science is
ahead of the money

00:31:42.002 --> 00:31:46.510
and I can think of
a million others.

00:31:46.510 --> 00:31:51.790
So I just feel
confident that we're

00:31:51.790 --> 00:31:55.480
going in an innovative
direction and we're doing it

00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:58.214
in a new way, which is
what all of you are about.

00:31:58.214 --> 00:32:00.380
BILL MARKS: Speaking of
innovative directions, Todd,

00:32:00.380 --> 00:32:02.830
can you give us a sense
of the scope of work

00:32:02.830 --> 00:32:04.740
that the foundation
has supported and is

00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:06.770
supported over the years?

00:32:06.770 --> 00:32:08.020
TODD SHERER: Yeah.

00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:10.600
We leave no stone
unturned, but we

00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:13.550
are focused on really
developing new treatments.

00:32:13.550 --> 00:32:15.910
A lot of this is now
coming out of really novel

00:32:15.910 --> 00:32:17.020
genetic discoveries.

00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:19.240
Parkinson's, in the
past, wasn't thought

00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:20.930
to have much of a
genetic component.

00:32:20.930 --> 00:32:24.040
But we're now uncovering a
lot of the molecular biology

00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:27.487
and underlying science to
develop new treatments.

00:32:27.487 --> 00:32:29.320
So there's a lot of
work the foundation does

00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:32.710
to build that knowledge base
around these new targets

00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:35.770
and directions and
early drug discovery.

00:32:35.770 --> 00:32:38.800
And more importantly, now, we're
doing additional work on really

00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:41.230
how we're going to go and
test these therapies to see

00:32:41.230 --> 00:32:43.390
if they're actually working.

00:32:43.390 --> 00:32:47.110
Michael was talking
about the exam that

00:32:47.110 --> 00:32:50.650
is done that involves
tapping your nose

00:32:50.650 --> 00:32:52.810
and tapping your feet,
and then the doctor

00:32:52.810 --> 00:32:55.720
gives you a one or two.

00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:58.270
The whole basis of a
multimillion dollar

00:32:58.270 --> 00:33:01.250
clinical trial is based
on those outcomes.

00:33:01.250 --> 00:33:03.010
So it's a big effort
the foundation has on

00:33:03.010 --> 00:33:04.990
trying to improve the
outcome measures that

00:33:04.990 --> 00:33:08.420
could be used in trials, both
biologically and clinically,

00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:11.020
with some more of the
objective measures.

00:33:11.020 --> 00:33:13.120
And the other thing that
I think is important

00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:16.150
is to get a better handle on
really the natural history

00:33:16.150 --> 00:33:18.520
of the disease and the
variability of the disease

00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:20.440
that the foundation's
working on.

00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:23.290
You asked Michael what
his typical day is.

00:33:23.290 --> 00:33:25.510
There's also not a typical
Parkinson's patient.

00:33:25.510 --> 00:33:29.189
So you have varied patients
having varied types of days.

00:33:29.189 --> 00:33:30.730
So we need to make
more sense of this

00:33:30.730 --> 00:33:32.260
again so we can
really understand

00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:34.030
how the drugs are
working, and that's

00:33:34.030 --> 00:33:35.800
a big effort the foundation has.

00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:39.790
This baseline that, then, all
the companies and all the drug

00:33:39.790 --> 00:33:41.530
developers can build on top of.

00:33:41.530 --> 00:33:42.550
BILL MARKS: This is PPMI
you're referring to.

00:33:42.550 --> 00:33:43.420
TODD SHERER: PPMI, right.

00:33:43.420 --> 00:33:44.470
BILL MARKS: Can you just
talk a little bit more

00:33:44.470 --> 00:33:45.580
about what PPMI is?

00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:46.330
TODD SHERER: Yeah.

00:33:46.330 --> 00:33:49.870
PPMI is the Parkinson's
Progression Markers Initiative.

00:33:49.870 --> 00:33:54.010
That is a large scale,
natural history study

00:33:54.010 --> 00:33:56.440
of Parkinson's and people
at risk for developing

00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:57.280
Parkinson's.

00:33:57.280 --> 00:34:01.290
It's in 35 sites
throughout the world

00:34:01.290 --> 00:34:04.870
and has rigorous clinical
data, biological data

00:34:04.870 --> 00:34:08.889
that's collected,
genetics, neuroimaging.

00:34:08.889 --> 00:34:11.070
And it's developed
as an open platform,

00:34:11.070 --> 00:34:13.719
so all the data is made
available in real time.

00:34:13.719 --> 00:34:16.600
It's a collaborative
between the academics

00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:19.000
and the pharmaceutical
companies that is spearheaded

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:20.440
through the foundation.

00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:22.659
And the goal of this
is to really establish

00:34:22.659 --> 00:34:25.690
a new framework for how we
would do clinical trials,

00:34:25.690 --> 00:34:28.960
particularly trials of drugs
that would slow the disease.

00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:30.730
We talked before
about treatments

00:34:30.730 --> 00:34:33.639
that could reduce
some of the symptoms,

00:34:33.639 --> 00:34:35.770
but ultimately, we
want a treatment

00:34:35.770 --> 00:34:38.236
that can slow the
progress of the disease.

00:34:38.236 --> 00:34:39.610
And in that case,
we need to have

00:34:39.610 --> 00:34:42.040
a better understanding of
how the disease is actually

00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:45.126
progressing, both
clinically and biologically.

00:34:45.126 --> 00:34:47.500
BILL MARKS: We're going to
open it up for questions soon,

00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:49.600
but I wonder, Todd,
if you had thoughts

00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:52.300
about what an
organization like Verily

00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:54.190
might contribute to
advancing the field.

00:34:54.190 --> 00:34:58.150
As you know, this is a room full
of hardware engineers, software

00:34:58.150 --> 00:35:00.670
engineers, computational
biologists, clinicians,

00:35:00.670 --> 00:35:03.760
clinical researchers,
and so many more types

00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:07.870
of people, basic scientists.

00:35:07.870 --> 00:35:09.070
What can we do to help?

00:35:09.070 --> 00:35:11.630
TODD SHERER: I think the work
that can be done here really

00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:15.010
would be fundamental to how
we can change our potential

00:35:15.010 --> 00:35:19.120
for developing transformative
treatments for Parkinson's.

00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:21.730
We now are in a position
where we have an ability

00:35:21.730 --> 00:35:25.210
to collect a vast amount
of data from people

00:35:25.210 --> 00:35:27.815
with Parkinson's at the
extent never before.

00:35:27.815 --> 00:35:29.440
And if you think
about the study I just

00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:32.140
talked about, the
PPMI initiative, we

00:35:32.140 --> 00:35:35.440
have whole genome sequencing,
we have brain imaging,

00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:40.210
we have proteomics, RNA
sequencing, clinical data all

00:35:40.210 --> 00:35:42.220
being collected over time.

00:35:42.220 --> 00:35:43.930
We would love to
have, obviously,

00:35:43.930 --> 00:35:45.710
more objective clinical data.

00:35:45.710 --> 00:35:49.370
So using technology to
track the course of a day,

00:35:49.370 --> 00:35:52.120
so it's not just that
half hour with a doctor,

00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:53.939
to get the clinical sense.

00:35:53.939 --> 00:35:55.480
But then, how are
we going to utilize

00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:59.470
all of this information and data
to make sense of the disease?

00:35:59.470 --> 00:36:01.840
So we have the input happening.

00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:05.170
How do we, now, make that
output, the analytics,

00:36:05.170 --> 00:36:07.350
and really the innovation
on that information?

00:36:07.350 --> 00:36:08.880
And I think the
kind of personnel

00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:11.790
that are here feed into
all of those components

00:36:11.790 --> 00:36:16.217
that are critical to really take
Parkinson's from 1817 to 2017.

00:36:16.217 --> 00:36:17.050
BILL MARKS: I agree.

00:36:17.050 --> 00:36:19.360
I agree.

00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:21.756
I'm going to wrap up my
questions with two of them.

00:36:21.756 --> 00:36:23.130
And I have a
feeling you're going

00:36:23.130 --> 00:36:28.680
to want to answer with the
optimistic answer last.

00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:31.140
So I'll start with a
more pessimistic one.

00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:33.260
What have you been
frustrated by?

00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:37.790
What hasn't really materialized
in the last 10, 15 years?

00:36:37.790 --> 00:36:40.150
MICHAEL J. FOX: Well, a cure.

00:36:40.150 --> 00:36:41.915
BILL MARKS: A cure.

00:36:41.915 --> 00:36:43.790
MICHAEL J. FOX: But I
was talking to the guys

00:36:43.790 --> 00:36:50.170
doing-- they're working on
the Liftware and devices

00:36:50.170 --> 00:36:55.260
that help a Parkinson's patient
live on a day-to-day basis.

00:36:55.260 --> 00:36:58.400
And just be normal, feel normal.

00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:05.240
Liftware is spoons that
neutralize tremor and is really

00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:06.440
great stuff.

00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:11.180
And I was saying earlier
that issues that I deal with,

00:37:11.180 --> 00:37:14.510
like just walking--
it's called festination,

00:37:14.510 --> 00:37:19.365
where your footsteps get so
synchronized that you get

00:37:19.365 --> 00:37:20.990
to a point where
you're frozen and then

00:37:20.990 --> 00:37:22.520
you tip over like a tree.

00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:24.350
There's nothing you
can do about it.

00:37:24.350 --> 00:37:26.840
But there are
tricks you can do--

00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:29.090
counting or keeping
your shoulders back

00:37:29.090 --> 00:37:32.432
and making big steps.

00:37:32.432 --> 00:37:33.890
But it's just all
this thinking you

00:37:33.890 --> 00:37:37.670
have to do all the time to do
this and that's all you do.

00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:41.300
And I have a hallway in my house
where I go around the corner

00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:43.270
and there's a door
to the hallway.

00:37:43.270 --> 00:37:45.770
There's a door to my closet,
which is just around the thing,

00:37:45.770 --> 00:37:48.950
and then the door to my
office, which is next door.

00:37:48.950 --> 00:37:50.780
So I have to work
with all these doors.

00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:53.060
And I had to put tape
down on the floor

00:37:53.060 --> 00:37:56.240
so I could step over the
tape so it would remind

00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:58.940
me to take a step and to
not get shuffled and fall

00:37:58.940 --> 00:38:00.980
into the closet.

00:38:00.980 --> 00:38:03.470
And my wife said, we
love you, but can we

00:38:03.470 --> 00:38:05.645
get rid of the freaking tape?

00:38:05.645 --> 00:38:07.135
And I said, I can't.

00:38:07.135 --> 00:38:08.030
I'll wipe out.

00:38:08.030 --> 00:38:13.280
And that, to me, seems like a
simple thing, to some way deal

00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:15.530
with--

00:38:15.530 --> 00:38:18.810
to look down and create
a beam for yourself

00:38:18.810 --> 00:38:21.170
that discrete and
invisible to anyone else,

00:38:21.170 --> 00:38:23.335
and you can step over it.

00:38:23.335 --> 00:38:26.690
This is the kind of
stuff you guys do.

00:38:26.690 --> 00:38:35.780
Just to alter the reality in
a way that you can function.

00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:37.970
And short of a cure,
that kind of stuff

00:38:37.970 --> 00:38:40.280
would be really valuable
and really important.

00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:42.530
BILL MARKS: You talked about
some of your frustrations

00:38:42.530 --> 00:38:43.310
on the flip side.

00:38:43.310 --> 00:38:44.840
What are you most
proud of, in terms

00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:47.285
of your work in
Parkinson's advocacy?

00:38:47.285 --> 00:38:50.315
MICHAEL J. FOX: Well,
I'm just a happy guy.

00:38:50.315 --> 00:38:53.150
I just look at life
as endless opportunity

00:38:53.150 --> 00:38:56.090
and I wake up every day curious.

00:38:56.090 --> 00:38:58.584
And I think that's as
important as anything,

00:38:58.584 --> 00:39:00.000
to wake up every
day and say, what

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:01.250
is this day going to bring me?

00:39:01.250 --> 00:39:02.720
What is this day
going to bring us?

00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:04.890
What are the
possibilities in this day?

00:39:04.890 --> 00:39:08.550
And what are
outcomes I might see?

00:39:08.550 --> 00:39:12.290
Again, I live in acceptance
and not in expectation.

00:39:12.290 --> 00:39:15.740
But acceptance
isn't resignation.

00:39:15.740 --> 00:39:17.420
It's just
acknowledging the truth

00:39:17.420 --> 00:39:19.432
and being empowered by it.

00:39:19.432 --> 00:39:24.888
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:38.244 --> 00:39:40.410
BILL MARKS: I think we have
time for some questions,

00:39:40.410 --> 00:39:42.550
so we'd love to open
it up to the audience.

00:39:42.550 --> 00:39:46.510
We have some microphones
in the center aisle.

00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:51.099
Feel free to ask questions
of Michael, Todd, Debi.

00:39:51.099 --> 00:39:51.640
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:52.450
How are you?

00:39:52.450 --> 00:39:53.090
I'm Vanessa.

00:39:53.090 --> 00:39:54.460
I'm in the science team.

00:39:54.460 --> 00:39:56.900
I work with microbiomes and
I had a couple of questions

00:39:56.900 --> 00:40:00.310
not related to microbiome.

00:40:00.310 --> 00:40:04.330
In diabetes, we have a pump and
you have the glucose monitor,

00:40:04.330 --> 00:40:09.790
so you can kind of titrate your
insulin treatment depending

00:40:09.790 --> 00:40:12.080
on your glucose in your blood.

00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:16.690
So I was wondering if you could
titrate the treatment depending

00:40:16.690 --> 00:40:18.440
on your physical symptoms.

00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:20.860
So if you had, for
example, this watch that

00:40:20.860 --> 00:40:24.580
is monitoring your
movements through the day,

00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:29.770
would that inform how you
would titrate your therapy?

00:40:29.770 --> 00:40:34.030
And on that note, what are
the challenges of using things

00:40:34.030 --> 00:40:38.140
like the equivalent of
an insulin pump or patch

00:40:38.140 --> 00:40:44.650
for just giving therapy to the
patients, Todd and Michael?

00:40:44.650 --> 00:40:47.890
TODD SHERER: So I'll start
and Bill could help, too.

00:40:47.890 --> 00:40:50.980
So I think, first, the
answer is, in terms

00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:54.970
of having an objective measure
and titrating your medicine,

00:40:54.970 --> 00:40:58.060
the answer would be
this would be a goal.

00:40:58.060 --> 00:41:01.750
One of the challenges we have
is, in the diabetes example,

00:41:01.750 --> 00:41:06.100
you're actually measuring
a real-time biologic impact

00:41:06.100 --> 00:41:07.370
of the drug.

00:41:07.370 --> 00:41:09.670
So that is a need in
Parkinson's, still,

00:41:09.670 --> 00:41:13.570
to understand more of the
biology and have a biomarker.

00:41:13.570 --> 00:41:19.250
But we could use an objective
measure of the motor symptoms.

00:41:19.250 --> 00:41:23.680
And if the patient could start
to identify when they think

00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:26.620
their medication is
starting to wear off,

00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:31.310
objectively, they could actually
preemptively take the medicine.

00:41:31.310 --> 00:41:33.970
So that instead of a patient
maybe going like this

00:41:33.970 --> 00:41:35.890
during the day with
their medicine,

00:41:35.890 --> 00:41:38.170
if you could kind of
see, I'm about to go off,

00:41:38.170 --> 00:41:40.150
take your pills, so
as that kicks in,

00:41:40.150 --> 00:41:41.890
you never hit that trough.

00:41:41.890 --> 00:41:43.690
I think that is a
real possibility

00:41:43.690 --> 00:41:46.030
with the technology.

00:41:46.030 --> 00:41:48.700
In terms of the
delivery of the drug,

00:41:48.700 --> 00:41:50.890
the real challenge with
the pumps have been just

00:41:50.890 --> 00:41:54.700
the biochemistry of levodopa--
which is the medicine that

00:41:54.700 --> 00:41:56.200
the patients use--

00:41:56.200 --> 00:41:57.670
the dosing that's
needed and being

00:41:57.670 --> 00:42:01.390
able to formulate enough of
it into a pump that would

00:42:01.390 --> 00:42:03.700
last the entirety of the day.

00:42:03.700 --> 00:42:07.570
And there's projects that
are working on that now.

00:42:07.570 --> 00:42:10.450
But so I think there's
a lot of parallels.

00:42:10.450 --> 00:42:15.374
More research would be needed to
get to the implication of that.

00:42:15.374 --> 00:42:17.290
BILL MARKS: Do you really
want to screw around

00:42:17.290 --> 00:42:18.730
with all the stuff?

00:42:18.730 --> 00:42:21.400
Looking at watches and--

00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:23.160
MICHAEL J. FOX: To
me, it's simple.

00:42:23.160 --> 00:42:26.110
It's simpler than sitting
there for half an hour.

00:42:26.110 --> 00:42:29.240
And I'm grateful that my
doctor gives me a half an hour.

00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:31.000
Most patients don't get that.

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:38.800
But yeah, I mean, to just have
an impartial, factual record

00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:42.110
of what you're experiencing
and to have someone

00:42:42.110 --> 00:42:44.610
be able to look at that graph
and say, here are your problem

00:42:44.610 --> 00:42:48.040
areas, here's where you're
having difficult transitions

00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:50.800
and then try some
medication accordingly.

00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:52.990
Because I answered questions
about my typical day--

00:42:52.990 --> 00:42:55.375
and I didn't say that--
but that's the thing.

00:42:55.375 --> 00:42:58.170
A typical day is
managing symptoms.

00:42:58.170 --> 00:43:00.280
And you do everything
else around that.

00:43:03.266 --> 00:43:05.882
I can't say it's tiring
or exhausting or annoying

00:43:05.882 --> 00:43:08.090
or frustrating or saddening
or maddening or anything.

00:43:08.090 --> 00:43:09.095
It just is.

00:43:09.095 --> 00:43:10.720
Again, it's the idea
of the fact of it.

00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:15.260
It just is, so that's my
thing I work on all day.

00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:17.650
How am I going to get to
a place that I want to be,

00:43:17.650 --> 00:43:19.630
where I'm comfortable?

00:43:19.630 --> 00:43:22.185
BILL MARKS: You just said this
is what you work on all day.

00:43:22.185 --> 00:43:23.060
MICHAEL J. FOX: Yeah.

00:43:23.060 --> 00:43:24.643
BILL MARKS: Is
managing your symptoms.

00:43:24.643 --> 00:43:27.580
MICHAEL J. FOX: But it's kind
of like walking or breathing.

00:43:27.580 --> 00:43:29.170
It's just a thing
that I do and I just

00:43:29.170 --> 00:43:34.300
add it to my portfolio of what
I need to do on a given day.

00:43:34.300 --> 00:43:36.500
BILL MARKS: Another question?

00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:37.180
Tom.

00:43:37.180 --> 00:43:38.100
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:43:38.100 --> 00:43:38.760
My name's Tom.

00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:40.397
I'm on the mental
health team here.

00:43:40.397 --> 00:43:41.730
MICHAEL J. FOX: We need to talk.

00:43:41.730 --> 00:43:42.938
AUDIENCE: We do need to talk.

00:43:42.938 --> 00:43:44.810
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:44.810 --> 00:43:46.830
That's what I wanted
to ask you about.

00:43:46.830 --> 00:43:49.670
Thanks for coming, all of
you from the foundation.

00:43:49.670 --> 00:43:52.074
We appreciate your insights.

00:43:52.074 --> 00:43:54.240
In addition to the kinds
of devices that we work on,

00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:57.870
we think a lot here about
big data and analytics

00:43:57.870 --> 00:44:02.330
and how to find patterns in
very noisy, but often important

00:44:02.330 --> 00:44:03.620
data.

00:44:03.620 --> 00:44:05.700
Michael, I was
impressed by your story

00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:07.579
about putting that
tape on the floor.

00:44:07.579 --> 00:44:09.120
Almost everything
you've talked to us

00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:13.380
about is ways you've
found to cope and to deal

00:44:13.380 --> 00:44:16.620
with this disease so that
you can continue to function.

00:44:16.620 --> 00:44:20.160
And I suspect there are
another million people

00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:24.570
with the same disease who also
have tricks that they've found.

00:44:24.570 --> 00:44:26.160
Sometimes even
medications that they

00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:27.576
may have found
that they're taking

00:44:27.576 --> 00:44:30.510
for asthma or for some other
problem that surprisingly helps

00:44:30.510 --> 00:44:32.580
them with their
Parkinson's symptoms.

00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:35.460
Does the foundation have
a way of crowdsourcing

00:44:35.460 --> 00:44:38.760
that information, pulling
in from a million people

00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:42.270
and their families, what works,
what doesn't, and then people

00:44:42.270 --> 00:44:43.945
like us can help to
make sense of that?

00:44:43.945 --> 00:44:46.070
Is that something that the
foundation thinks about?

00:44:46.070 --> 00:44:48.755
MICHAEL J. FOX: Well, you can
speak to it programatically,

00:44:48.755 --> 00:44:50.970
but on general terms--

00:44:50.970 --> 00:44:52.650
Todd talked about how
we're specifically

00:44:52.650 --> 00:44:56.110
doing that, but one of the
big breakthroughs in this.

00:44:56.110 --> 00:44:57.587
Someone was asking
me earlier, what

00:44:57.587 --> 00:44:59.420
are the big breakthroughs
in the foundation.

00:44:59.420 --> 00:45:02.370
One of our big breakthroughs
was finding a way

00:45:02.370 --> 00:45:07.350
to incorporate patient
involvement and patient

00:45:07.350 --> 00:45:10.840
knowledge and wisdom
and enthusiasm.

00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:14.970
And the fact that it's
about these people.

00:45:14.970 --> 00:45:19.790
So they can help us with
what we're trying to do.

00:45:19.790 --> 00:45:22.320
So all those things I find
really fascinating when

00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:25.219
I talk to Parkinson's
patients is that we all

00:45:25.219 --> 00:45:26.260
have a different disease.

00:45:26.260 --> 00:45:28.634
There's a million of us with
a million different versions

00:45:28.634 --> 00:45:29.250
of it.

00:45:29.250 --> 00:45:33.880
We have things that we have
difficulty with that someone

00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:36.300
else may not deal with at all.

00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:40.620
I don't-- gastrointestinal
stuff, I don't have.

00:45:40.620 --> 00:45:42.330
I never had an issue with that.

00:45:42.330 --> 00:45:44.112
I never had an issue with--

00:45:44.112 --> 00:45:46.320
until recently, I didn't
have an issue with sleeping.

00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:51.450
But so this back and
forth between patients

00:45:51.450 --> 00:45:55.320
really helps doctors
and researchers.

00:45:55.320 --> 00:45:56.070
TODD SHERER: Yeah.

00:45:56.070 --> 00:45:59.410
So exactly based
on this philosophy,

00:45:59.410 --> 00:46:02.130
we're in the process of
launching what's just

00:46:02.130 --> 00:46:05.670
getting started, a project
called Fox Insight,

00:46:05.670 --> 00:46:09.900
which is an online platform for
patients to do exactly this.

00:46:09.900 --> 00:46:13.560
To collect information from
as many patients as we can

00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:17.310
and have them complete surveys
and also fill out information

00:46:17.310 --> 00:46:22.830
to just get more insights
in a kind of confined way

00:46:22.830 --> 00:46:23.790
on this information.

00:46:23.790 --> 00:46:26.640
And the data will all be made
available from that for people

00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:29.820
to dig into, both
surveys and free text

00:46:29.820 --> 00:46:31.990
and that type of information.

00:46:31.990 --> 00:46:34.920
So we see this as kind of
complementary to the-- the PPMI

00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:37.860
initiative is a small number
of people and really deep.

00:46:37.860 --> 00:46:39.600
And this would be
as many people as we

00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:42.690
could get, but more superficial
kind of information.

00:46:42.690 --> 00:46:45.300
And then playing those
two off of each other

00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:48.212
to get as much
insights as we can.

00:46:48.212 --> 00:46:49.420
BILL MARKS: Another question?

00:46:49.420 --> 00:46:49.750
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:46:49.750 --> 00:46:50.650
My name is James.

00:46:50.650 --> 00:46:53.530
I'm a scientist who also
works in the same department

00:46:53.530 --> 00:46:55.810
with our microbiome
expert over here.

00:46:55.810 --> 00:46:58.450
But to follow up on her
question about therapy,

00:46:58.450 --> 00:47:01.560
it sounds like you and maybe
Parkinson's sufferers also

00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:03.970
have a pretty
complicated relationship

00:47:03.970 --> 00:47:06.550
with their therapy that they're
taking, their medications.

00:47:06.550 --> 00:47:09.130
And I'm wondering, is
compliance with the therapy

00:47:09.130 --> 00:47:11.440
or the regiment a
challenge that is

00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:13.840
faced with trying to interpret
information coming off

00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:16.880
a clinical trial, or even
to manage the disease?

00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:18.570
And are there
solutions that you guys

00:47:18.570 --> 00:47:23.122
are looking at that might be
a way to amend that problem?

00:47:23.122 --> 00:47:24.830
BILL MARKS: So maybe
a two-part question.

00:47:24.830 --> 00:47:26.320
The first for Michael.

00:47:26.320 --> 00:47:29.260
How difficult is it to manage
the medication schedule

00:47:29.260 --> 00:47:29.770
each day?

00:47:29.770 --> 00:47:32.040
MICHAEL J. FOX:
Well, it's difficult,

00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:38.600
but again, someone who's a
paraplegic has difficulties.

00:47:38.600 --> 00:47:40.600
Everybody gets their
own set of issues.

00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:41.847
And I'm aware of that.

00:47:41.847 --> 00:47:43.180
And it's how you deal with them.

00:47:46.440 --> 00:47:48.710
How you deal with them
is an individual thing.

00:47:48.710 --> 00:47:54.800
And so I struggle sometimes
with getting it right.

00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:57.820
For the most part, if
I can function and do

00:47:57.820 --> 00:48:00.360
what I planned to do during the
course of a day, it's great.

00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:00.860
There's

00:48:00.860 --> 00:48:02.740
There are things that--

00:48:02.740 --> 00:48:04.360
like, I golf.

00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:05.680
And I'm a terrible golfer.

00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:07.880
I started golfing in my
40s with Parkinson's.

00:48:07.880 --> 00:48:11.847
So if that's not optimism,
I don't know what is.

00:48:11.847 --> 00:48:13.180
But I was golfing the other day.

00:48:13.180 --> 00:48:15.550
And I'll go to put
the tee on the ball

00:48:15.550 --> 00:48:18.130
and I'll be there for,
literally, five minutes,

00:48:18.130 --> 00:48:19.442
putting it on and it falls off.

00:48:19.442 --> 00:48:20.650
I put it on and it falls off.

00:48:20.650 --> 00:48:21.858
I put it on and it falls off.

00:48:21.858 --> 00:48:22.662
I adjust the tee.

00:48:22.662 --> 00:48:24.160
I put it on and it falls off.

00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:25.502
I put the ball on slow.

00:48:25.502 --> 00:48:26.710
I'd get my hand away quicker.

00:48:26.710 --> 00:48:27.820
It falls off.

00:48:27.820 --> 00:48:30.020
And there's three guys waiting.

00:48:30.020 --> 00:48:32.492
And it's just, fuck 'em.

00:48:32.492 --> 00:48:33.783
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:33.783 --> 00:48:35.366
It's going to take
as long as it takes

00:48:35.366 --> 00:48:36.616
me to get the ball on the tee.

00:48:36.616 --> 00:48:39.160
And then I end up swinging
and miss it twice.

00:48:39.160 --> 00:48:40.505
So it's hang in.

00:48:40.505 --> 00:48:42.610
It's a long day.

00:48:42.610 --> 00:48:45.800
And it's just the way it is.

00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:49.330
So I do deal with
titrating the meds,

00:48:49.330 --> 00:48:53.020
but it's just the way it is.

00:48:53.020 --> 00:48:55.690
TODD SHERER: I think, in
general, Parkinson's patients,

00:48:55.690 --> 00:48:57.430
compared to other
diseases, are pretty

00:48:57.430 --> 00:49:00.010
compliant with their
medicine because they

00:49:00.010 --> 00:49:02.510
feel the impact of it.

00:49:02.510 --> 00:49:04.570
It's not like, for example,
taking a high blood

00:49:04.570 --> 00:49:06.290
pressure pill, where--

00:49:06.290 --> 00:49:08.380
or an antibiotic-- if
you forgot to take it,

00:49:08.380 --> 00:49:11.140
you don't really realize
you forgot to take it.

00:49:11.140 --> 00:49:13.960
Michael will you realize if he
forgot to take his medicine.

00:49:13.960 --> 00:49:16.750
His timing may be
off, but it's not

00:49:16.750 --> 00:49:18.580
like he's not taking it at all.

00:49:21.700 --> 00:49:23.880
BILL MARKS: Any closing
thoughts that you

00:49:23.880 --> 00:49:26.640
would offer the group today?

00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:28.860
TODD SHERER: I guess,
just to reiterate,

00:49:28.860 --> 00:49:33.540
our thank you for including
us in your Grand Rounds

00:49:33.540 --> 00:49:36.430
and for your commitment
to Parkinson's disease.

00:49:36.430 --> 00:49:39.450
And I do think
that for us to take

00:49:39.450 --> 00:49:42.210
the research to the next level,
which ultimately the goal is

00:49:42.210 --> 00:49:44.220
to bring the treatments
to the next level,

00:49:44.220 --> 00:49:45.990
will take this new
approach of bringing

00:49:45.990 --> 00:49:49.050
new disciplines into the area
and I think the model here

00:49:49.050 --> 00:49:53.131
is a great one for the field to
be following and integrating.

00:49:53.131 --> 00:49:55.380
Because that will really
bring us to the breakthroughs

00:49:55.380 --> 00:49:56.250
that we want.

00:49:56.250 --> 00:49:58.680
So thank you for all the work
you're doing on Parkinson's.

00:49:58.680 --> 00:49:59.570
BILL MARKS: Thanks, Todd.

00:49:59.570 --> 00:50:01.110
And Michael, any
closing comments.

00:50:01.110 --> 00:50:02.640
MICHAEL J. FOX: I just
want to say thank you.

00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:04.170
Thank you so much
for your interest

00:50:04.170 --> 00:50:10.250
and for applying your
intellect to our situation,

00:50:10.250 --> 00:50:16.410
and just for understanding
that all I'm here to do--

00:50:16.410 --> 00:50:18.570
separate from Todd, who
can speak about program

00:50:18.570 --> 00:50:23.040
and science-- is to let you know
that you're affecting patients,

00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:24.294
you're affecting people.

00:50:24.294 --> 00:50:26.460
And then they have-- my
experience is my experience,

00:50:26.460 --> 00:50:28.990
but they all have
their own experience.

00:50:28.990 --> 00:50:32.310
And yet, a common
bond between all of us

00:50:32.310 --> 00:50:36.385
is that we depend on people
and we depend on researchers

00:50:36.385 --> 00:50:39.030
and we depend on smart,
empathetic people

00:50:39.030 --> 00:50:43.520
that can figure out what we
need and help us get there.

00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:48.860
And I'm grateful for your
interest and for your actions.

00:50:48.860 --> 00:50:51.750
BILL MARKS: Well, we're very
grateful that you visited us

00:50:51.750 --> 00:50:52.570
today.

00:50:52.570 --> 00:50:54.920
Thanks for your
inspirational comments.

00:50:54.920 --> 00:50:59.470
[APPLAUSE]
