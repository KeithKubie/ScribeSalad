00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:05.930
In this class, we'll be leveraging D3 to create interactive data visualizations.

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:12.700
Since D3 stands on the shoulders of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SVG, we

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.258
will need to get comfortable with these technologies before we start using it.

00:00:16.258 --> 00:00:19.630
Although it's not required to know these technologies for

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.980
this course, much of the live code and exercises will assume that you

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.330
have a basic proficiency with each of these technologies.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.870
If you don't feel comfortable with these technologies, we've included many

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:36.770
exercises and tutorials in the resources portion of the course or

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.150
in the instructor notes for each video.

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.590
I recommend taking a break now and

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.720
going to the resources section of this course now in order to

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.570
understand the code that is going to follow or if you want after this lesson

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.160
to brush up on anything that I may have covered that is unfamiliar to you.
