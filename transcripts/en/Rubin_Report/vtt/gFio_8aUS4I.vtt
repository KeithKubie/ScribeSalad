1
00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:05.060
All right.
We are live on youtube people.

2
00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.060
I have just returned from touring with Jordan Peterson.

3
00:00:08.061 --> 00:00:11.570
I went directly to Joe Rogan and now we're going to do a show.

4
00:00:11.571 --> 00:00:13.760
Joining me today is neuroscientists,

5
00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.870
bestselling author and mysterious man of Internet controversy,

6
00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.400
Sam Harris.
Welcome back to the Ruben.
How was that for an intro for you?

7
00:00:22.401 --> 00:00:26.930
Mysterious man of Internet works as well as anything else in my bio.
Yeah.

8
00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.940
You seem to be somebody that wants inner peace and yet constantly involved in

9
00:00:31.941 --> 00:00:34.830
these endless I to enough to screw that up.
It seems for,

10
00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.660
for reasons that I can't figure out,
but is that a scientific test for you?

11
00:00:38.661 --> 00:00:39.494
Possibly.

12
00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.180
<v 0>Well,
you know,
I've just,
uh,
I don't think we've talked about this,</v>

13
00:00:43.181 --> 00:00:46.570
but I have pulled back from social media to a big degree and that,

14
00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.050
that is a variable that,
I mean,
I obviously,
I,

15
00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:54.160
I'd heard that advertised to me as a problem and I had thought about it in the

16
00:00:54.161 --> 00:00:55.030
abstract as a problem.

17
00:00:55.031 --> 00:00:58.570
And I know you've gone off the grid for a month or something,

18
00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.050
but just,
I mean,
I,
I've cut down,

19
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.440
I was never using Facebook as anything other than a publishing channel.

20
00:01:05.441 --> 00:01:09.580
I never got into comments on Facebook,
but I got hooked by Twitter as you know,

21
00:01:09.581 --> 00:01:14.581
and I'm probably spending five minutes a day on Twitter at most.

22
00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:18.790
So aside from just,
it's just a surgical strike on Twitter,

23
00:01:18.791 --> 00:01:21.550
just put something out and see what's there,
read a couple articles,
you know,

24
00:01:21.551 --> 00:01:23.740
just find links to articles that interest me.
So,
I mean,

25
00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.460
it's still a way of getting news,
but to not,
to fundamentally,

26
00:01:27.461 --> 00:01:28.960
not only not engage,

27
00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.990
but not even know what's going on on Twitter has been a total reset of my brain.

28
00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:35.620
I mean it's,
it's,
um,

29
00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.130
it's been amazingly toxic in a way that I never appreciate it.

30
00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.320
<v 1>Yeah.
So I think my audience knows my feelings on this steady.
Yeah.</v>

31
00:01:42.321 --> 00:01:47.030
It's endlessly toxic.
Yet at some level it's helped connect all of us.
I mean,

32
00:01:47.031 --> 00:01:49.070
we originally connected through Twitter.

33
00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.760
These things kind of morph and change and have moments where they're much worse

34
00:01:52.761 --> 00:01:55.230
and then suddenly they're much better.
They also help,
you know,

35
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.460
help start revolutions in the Middle East.
So it's like not all evil,

36
00:01:58.461 --> 00:02:01.800
but are you afraid?
A little bit of getting disconnected all,

37
00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.750
all together that you'll miss some of the Zeitgeists

38
00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.390
<v 0>I'm definitely missing stuff.
Yeah.
And I'm,
uh,</v>

39
00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:11.800
I'm still trying to use it strategically,

40
00:02:11.801 --> 00:02:14.550
so I'm trying to use it in precisely the way you just described what they're

41
00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.120
trying to get connected with people.

42
00:02:16.121 --> 00:02:20.320
I reached out to somebody who's this woman dia,
who just did a documentary.

43
00:02:20.321 --> 00:02:23.920
I want to get her on the podcast.
I tweeted at her,
uh,

44
00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.940
I haven't spent enough time looking to see if she's even noticed.

45
00:02:27.941 --> 00:02:30.100
So it's like I'm not totally paying attention,

46
00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:35.520
but the benefit has been just immense because I just realized I,

47
00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.350
there's a kind of,

48
00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.570
it's a kind of hallucination machine where you begin to think you need to pay

49
00:02:43.571 --> 00:02:48.570
attention to certain voices that in the real world you would never see.
And they,

50
00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:53.610
and I'm agnostic as to whether or not these voices are in fact consequential and

51
00:02:53.711 --> 00:02:57.580
that you could sort of lose sight of how your reputation's unraveling online and

52
00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.920
you know,
just start getting phone from friends saying,

53
00:02:59.921 --> 00:03:02.710
sorry that's happening to you.
Which I think is,
you know,

54
00:03:02.711 --> 00:03:06.020
that's happened to some people.
But yeah.
Um,
you know,

55
00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.450
in my experience,
I,
maybe there's some exception to this,

56
00:03:10.451 --> 00:03:14.620
but virtually all of my kind of substantial controversial engagements on Twitter

57
00:03:14.621 --> 00:03:18.720
where I've noticed somebody go after me and then I've responded and then I

58
00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.070
either have done a podcast in [inaudible],
whatever the,
whatever the,
the,
uh,

59
00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.780
however that's propagated in my life.

60
00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:31.900
The net result has always been like,
you're getting back to zero if you're lucky.

61
00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:32.351
Right.

62
00:03:32.351 --> 00:03:35.470
It's like the whole thing is a confection of having been on social media in the

63
00:03:35.471 --> 00:03:40.120
first place and you're lucky to get back to zero.
And,
uh,
I mean,

64
00:03:40.121 --> 00:03:42.670
the truth is someone like me,
we can name the,
you know,

65
00:03:42.671 --> 00:03:44.440
the usual [inaudible] afternoon,
let me,

66
00:03:44.441 --> 00:03:48.460
none of these people exist in the real world.
I know,
like,
like,
I mean,

67
00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:49.330
they're not,
it's,
you know,

68
00:03:49.331 --> 00:03:53.170
and I would never see them just reading the New York Times for the most part.
Um,

69
00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.930
I certainly never see them in my life and it's just,

70
00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:00.820
it's very strange to feel like because someone had said something about you on

71
00:04:00.821 --> 00:04:02.790
social media or,
or,
you know,

72
00:04:02.791 --> 00:04:05.460
lied about you or spread an article that was terrible about your,

73
00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:10.210
whatever it is that you then have to somehow engage and,
and people,
you know,

74
00:04:10.211 --> 00:04:13.720
right?
Like,
you know,
who was it?
Uh,
or most recently,

75
00:04:13.721 --> 00:04:17.350
Robert Wright just wrote this idiotic wired piece about me.
Right?

76
00:04:17.351 --> 00:04:17.901
It's just like there's,

77
00:04:17.901 --> 00:04:22.390
there's not a single sentence in the piece that needs to be responded to.

78
00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.020
And I get inundated with by people think,
well,
this is,

79
00:04:25.021 --> 00:04:26.470
you really got to respond to this.
This is,

80
00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:30.520
this is interesting and substantial and it's nothing of the kind.

81
00:04:30.521 --> 00:04:34.360
It's like it's his attempted clickbait.
It's his attempt to provoke a,

82
00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:37.540
some kind of controversy between us on one of our podcasts.
I mean,

83
00:04:37.541 --> 00:04:39.900
he reached out to me,
so I just wrote this about you,
you know,

84
00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:42.440
I hope you'll come on my podcast or I'll come on yours to talking about

85
00:04:42.441 --> 00:04:44.080
efficient.
Yeah.
And it's just,

86
00:04:44.081 --> 00:04:49.081
it's a completely disingenuous and insubstantial thing and yet paying attention,

87
00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:51.220
it is a kind of meditation.
It's like,
it's,

88
00:04:51.221 --> 00:04:54.550
you have to become what you meditate on,
you become what you pay attention to.

89
00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:58.480
And so checking Twitter 30 times a day or whatever I was doing,

90
00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:03.370
just built a new mind for me,
which I,
you know,
I,
you know,

91
00:05:03.371 --> 00:05:06.430
I'm very happy to get rid of.
So,
uh,
yeah.
I don't know.

92
00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:10.240
I don't know that I'll ever get totally off it because for the reasons you

93
00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.020
suggest,
but I,

94
00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.930
I've cut it down literally by 95%.
Yeah.

95
00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:20.320
So I saw the interview you did was that CBS news about a week or two ago and you

96
00:05:20.321 --> 00:05:24.310
talked about how it's kind of making us all crazy.
I know that was an Australian,

97
00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:27.670
that was that Australia that was there was,
there was ABC in Australia.

98
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.300
So I saw that and you said something about how it's kind of making us all crazy

99
00:05:31.301 --> 00:05:33.010
and he was making me think too,
to your point,

100
00:05:33.011 --> 00:05:37.150
just now that it seems like we're almost living in two worlds at the same time

101
00:05:37.151 --> 00:05:39.940
right now.
Like if you walk around staring at that thing,

102
00:05:39.941 --> 00:05:42.370
like I'm traveling with that now.
So if I'm like at the airport,

103
00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:43.630
like I'm looking at this thing,

104
00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:48.300
you always get disconnected from the actual physical location.
Oh yeah,

105
00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:49.143
you totally do.

106
00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:53.650
You start ending up in some alternate world and to me that's a little bit sort

107
00:05:53.651 --> 00:05:57.070
of where we're going to end up with with Ai,
with all of these,

108
00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.430
they're all gonna kind of collide

109
00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:02.030
<v 1>into one thing that we're going to end up in the matrix or something like that.</v>

110
00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:06.120
<v 0>Yeah.
Well and you can be buried on your phone obviously without being buried on</v>

111
00:06:06.121 --> 00:06:10.930
social media.
So,
you know,
I've,
I've taken it off my phone,
which is a huge yeah.

112
00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:13.800
Um,
kind of gatekeeping function.
But

113
00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:17.420
<v 1>uh,
what do you think about how it changes our perception of time?</v>

114
00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:19.640
Because that's actually where I was going to start with you cause we just

115
00:06:19.641 --> 00:06:20.241
figured out,

116
00:06:20.241 --> 00:06:25.241
so the last time you were on the show was July of 2016 basically two years ago,

117
00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:30.550
which is crazy and it sort of seems like yesterday to me and yet it also seems

118
00:06:31.281 --> 00:06:35.570
like like 18 lifetimes ago and I think that maybe has something to do with

119
00:06:35.571 --> 00:06:38.540
social media changing the way we perceive time or something.

120
00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:42.570
<v 0>Uh,
well,
I don't know.
I don't think it's just social media.
I think it's just,</v>

121
00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:43.951
it's everything.

122
00:06:43.951 --> 00:06:47.730
Everything is conspiring to make time go faster as you're getting older.

123
00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:50.580
Just the,
the,

124
00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:55.160
the increase in novelty and just cha interested.
But we have,

125
00:06:55.161 --> 00:07:00.161
we're seeing changes in culture and technology that are clearly accelerating so

126
00:07:00.841 --> 00:07:04.740
that the world is different over the course of more different over the course of

127
00:07:04.741 --> 00:07:07.800
the year.
Then it's ever been,
I think that's,
that's subjectively true.

128
00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:11.250
But also you're just getting older so that every year is,
you know,

129
00:07:11.251 --> 00:07:15.840
that much less a piece of your,
the,
the life you've lived,
you know,
if you're,

130
00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:16.890
if you're 40,
you know,

131
00:07:16.891 --> 00:07:20.760
the next years is one 40th of the time you've been around and then you know,

132
00:07:20.761 --> 00:07:25.761
that becomes one 50th and so it's subjectively shorter and uh,

133
00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:28.500
yeah,
I'm a year for me it's like four months long now.

134
00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:30.300
<v 1>Just,
yeah,
they just blast by.</v>

135
00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:32.340
So there are a couple of things I want to hit on here.

136
00:07:32.341 --> 00:07:36.000
We'll do a little bit of politics,
but I do want to talk about uh,

137
00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:39.960
consciousness and I want to talk about your upcoming talks with Peterson and

138
00:07:39.961 --> 00:07:44.040
obviously I've gotten to know his mind pretty well at this point.

139
00:07:44.041 --> 00:07:46.680
Have some inside information that I should have at this point.
I might,

140
00:07:46.681 --> 00:07:48.570
I might be able to offer you a little something and,

141
00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:51.660
and I think maybe we can set the table for how many events are you doing with

142
00:07:51.661 --> 00:07:52.030
them?

143
00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:56.650
<v 0>We're doing four.
We have four.
The only four we've spoken about others,</v>

144
00:07:56.651 --> 00:08:00.370
but I think four is certainly enough to see whether we can,
we can do this.

145
00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.260
So the funny thing,
it might be three,
two minutes.

146
00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:05.290
<v 1>That's what I'm worried.
It might be forging metal you'll find out.</v>

147
00:08:05.291 --> 00:08:08.710
But the funny thing is that I didn't know until I mentioned to him last night

148
00:08:08.711 --> 00:08:11.430
when we were at Atlanta,
I said,
oh,
you know,
I have Sam on tomorrow.
Um,

149
00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:14.950
is there anything on your mind that I can bring up that'll sort of set the table

150
00:08:14.951 --> 00:08:15.784
for this whole thing?

151
00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:19.420
I didn't realize that you guys have actually never met in person,

152
00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:24.040
which having listened to the two podcasts,
which you did on a computer,

153
00:08:24.041 --> 00:08:26.800
on Skype or whatever,
that that podcasting thing you used,

154
00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:32.010
that's kind of crazy that you guys haven't actually sat there and just,
you know,

155
00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:33.850
looked in his eyes and I've done this.

156
00:08:33.851 --> 00:08:36.340
Does that feel weird to you that you're going to do all this publicly in that

157
00:08:36.341 --> 00:08:37.174
way?

158
00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:40.690
<v 0>Well,
I've done a bunch of events with people I've never met,
you know,
like words,</v>

159
00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:44.100
a podcast guest or someone I'm sharing the stage with for the first time.

160
00:08:44.101 --> 00:08:46.260
And so I've actually,
I've,
I've,

161
00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:51.000
I know him better than s s several of the people I've recently done live events

162
00:08:51.001 --> 00:08:51.890
with in San Diego.

163
00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:55.740
I've spoken to on the phone ones and we've done those two podcasts.
Yeah.

164
00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:57.270
But yeah,
no,
it's,
I,

165
00:08:57.290 --> 00:09:02.190
it's obviously not optimal to be having these conversations.

166
00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:06.870
Uh,
a well,
it selects for different things.
I think there are people,

167
00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:07.590
I think it's,

168
00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:11.340
I think Terry Gross of fresh air will never do anything face to face.

169
00:09:11.341 --> 00:09:15.510
I think she does all of her interviews.
Even if you're in Philadelphia,
I could,

170
00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:17.760
could be radiology,
I'm getting this wrong.

171
00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:22.530
I think she just likes to this sort of the purity of pure audio.

172
00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:25.590
And it could,
because the product is audio,
there's no video component to it.

173
00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:30.530
And I understand that in the sense that if you're having like,
so,

174
00:09:30.531 --> 00:09:32.910
so if we were just doing an audio podcast now,

175
00:09:32.911 --> 00:09:35.760
I mean now is it just a pure audio podcast or I'm sensitive to this.

176
00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:38.760
You and I are having an experience now we're looking at each other.

177
00:09:38.761 --> 00:09:40.640
We have various cues.
We,

178
00:09:40.641 --> 00:09:44.820
we know we have a sense of how the conversation's going in and which,

179
00:09:44.821 --> 00:09:48.270
which can be misleading you because if the final product is just audio,

180
00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:51.870
you can think there's stuff coming through which isn't coming through.

181
00:09:51.871 --> 00:09:54.150
And so when you don't have any of those,

182
00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:58.350
any of that information and you just got the other person's voice on the line,

183
00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:02.790
you have a very clear sense of what you're getting and if you're not getting

184
00:10:02.791 --> 00:10:06.240
what you want to be getting and then you modify what you're doing in some,

185
00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:10.920
on some level.
So,
yeah.
Um,
so yeah,
it's working for me,
but I think it's,

186
00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:14.520
as far as establishing rapport with someone,

187
00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:18.490
it's definitely not ideal.
So we,
we've had moments where we've,

188
00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:19.710
we could have used more

189
00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:23.750
<v 1>or probably,
yeah.
Alright.
Let's shelve the rest of Peter's until,
after.
What,</v>

190
00:10:23.751 --> 00:10:24.880
what do you make of this whole thing?

191
00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:29.170
Somehow the conversations that we've all been having often completely

192
00:10:29.171 --> 00:10:30.880
independently of each other.
Right?
I mean,

193
00:10:30.881 --> 00:10:35.680
you haven't been here for two years have suddenly become like the zeitgeists

194
00:10:35.681 --> 00:10:39.820
thing.
Like you know,
Barry Weiss wrote this intellectual,
dark web article.

195
00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:42.730
People think we have a card and there's a clubhouse and the whole thing as far

196
00:10:42.731 --> 00:10:46.480
as if there is,
I haven't been invited,
but that whatever it is,

197
00:10:46.481 --> 00:10:49.990
we're all doing the conversations you're having and I'm having and Rogan's

198
00:10:49.991 --> 00:10:50.381
having,

199
00:10:50.381 --> 00:10:55.381
and this whole crew of people seem to be doing something that was very needed at

200
00:10:56.291 --> 00:10:59.050
some level or another.
Yeah.

201
00:10:59.051 --> 00:11:04.051
Well I think there's certainly a diversity of opinion within this group or a

202
00:11:04.181 --> 00:11:07.270
pseudo group about what's going on here.
I mean,
we,
as you know,

203
00:11:07.271 --> 00:11:09.640
we have not had a meeting where we've agreed that,
you know,

204
00:11:09.641 --> 00:11:11.790
what about what this is,
but it's anything.

205
00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:15.580
We've had a quiet half a meeting where we disagreed on it,
barely that.

206
00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:20.550
And did you see Eric Weinstein's video about just what,
what this was and that,

207
00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:21.041
I mean,
it's like,

208
00:11:21.041 --> 00:11:26.041
so 100% of what he said on that video was never anything that he said to me or

209
00:11:26.201 --> 00:11:27.580
that,
you know,
it's like this,
you know,

210
00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:30.330
this is how he coined the phrase in his own mind.
Well,

211
00:11:30.370 --> 00:11:31.930
I had just brought him up on stage at,

212
00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:35.410
in Tempe at the Improv the night before and I think he was high on comedy and

213
00:11:35.411 --> 00:11:39.250
just like,
I'm going to talk to people.
So I found everything you said.

214
00:11:39.251 --> 00:11:44.100
Very interesting.
And as you know,
I love Eric.
He's fantastic.
But,
uh,
here,

215
00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:48.460
he coined the phrase on my podcast,
I think in an earlier podcast,

216
00:11:48.461 --> 00:11:53.110
but then it was reiterated in this live event we did with Ben Shapiro,
you named.

217
00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:54.000
And then I came

218
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.600
<v 0>then that was with that podcast and I,
no exaggeration,</v>

219
00:11:58.601 --> 00:12:01.490
I thought for like 15 seconds,
but what I was going to title this podcast,

220
00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:05.170
it was just,
it was just,
you know,
so it,
it was,
it was,

221
00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:09.710
has always been tongue in cheek and,
um,

222
00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:13.400
if fairly superficial analogy for me and,
but,

223
00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:16.340
but an interesting one in the sense that there is a,

224
00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:19.630
the analogy to the dark web is appropriate in that

225
00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:25.240
insofar as there's this area where a lot is going on,

226
00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:30.600
that the mainstream media in this case is basically unaware of.

227
00:12:30.911 --> 00:12:31.210
I mean,

228
00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:34.210
obviously there's many people in the mainstream media and people who consume the

229
00:12:34.211 --> 00:12:39.190
mainstream media where there are lists also listening to my podcast or Rogan's

230
00:12:39.191 --> 00:12:43.660
are watching you.
Uh,
so you know,
many people know we exist,
but people,

231
00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:48.910
uh,
are,
have been very slow to appreciate just how big the audiences,
I mean,

232
00:12:48.911 --> 00:12:51.380
Rogan's audience is just an enormous,
you know,

233
00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:54.690
and our audiences are absurd compared to what's happening on,

234
00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:58.840
on CNN for instance.
But um,
you know,

235
00:12:58.841 --> 00:13:03.310
I mean Rogan's audiences like it's like every episode is the finale of the game

236
00:13:03.311 --> 00:13:06.970
of Thrones,
right?
Yeah.
It's just,
it's completely insane.
No one knows this,
right?

237
00:13:06.971 --> 00:13:10.470
Like he,
I mean,
he carried occasionally brags about how big his audience is,

238
00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:14.980
but it's,
my sense is that people,

239
00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:17.820
the New York Times aren't aware or people,

240
00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:21.550
even CNN aren't aware that they're in competition with me.

241
00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:23.950
Just to take CNN is the most relevant column.

242
00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:28.150
If you get invited to go on Anderson Cooper show tonight and give an interview,

243
00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:31.750
you're going to get six minutes,
you know,
the best case,

244
00:13:31.751 --> 00:13:36.520
12 minutes to try to make sense and try to not embarrass yourself with Ian.

245
00:13:36.521 --> 00:13:40.950
I've within a frame that is really rigid.
It's not me.

246
00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:45.030
It's the time pressure alone modifies you just what kind of conversations you

247
00:13:45.031 --> 00:13:45.864
can have there.

248
00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:50.830
And in prime time you're going to go out to a million people at best with

249
00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:54.250
Anderson Cooper and how many are actually watching the television?

250
00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:56.950
I mean the television's on in all sorts of applications that nobody's even

251
00:13:56.951 --> 00:14:00.430
watching.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So I count my audience,

252
00:14:00.431 --> 00:14:02.560
it's something like a million people and as hard as you know,

253
00:14:02.561 --> 00:14:04.270
to get great podcast metrics,

254
00:14:04.271 --> 00:14:09.271
but Joe's is probably 10 times that per episode if not more.

255
00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:10.930
So.
I mean you're talking to so and,

256
00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:14.440
and in those cases you're talking about two and three hour conversations that

257
00:14:14.441 --> 00:14:19.441
people are actually listening to and forget about what it's like to be the host

258
00:14:19.810 --> 00:14:21.230
on a show like that.
The,

259
00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:25.890
the opportunity for someone else to come on and have a conversation and make

260
00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:30.250
sense and correct themselves and go through the whole warp and woof of,

261
00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:31.093
of of a,

262
00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:36.300
a genuine conversation that isn't unnaturally bounded by a time limit.

263
00:14:36.410 --> 00:14:36.851
I mean,

264
00:14:36.851 --> 00:14:41.851
I noticed the difference between a an hour long radio conversation that gets

265
00:14:43.151 --> 00:14:48.151
ported to the podcast where everyone just knew clearly that they had to bring

266
00:14:48.521 --> 00:14:52.840
this in.
And an hour was like,
even that defines the conversation.
And so,
uh,

267
00:14:53.010 --> 00:14:58.010
I think people are very slow to wake up to how those two things,

268
00:14:58.611 --> 00:15:02.960
like a big audience with an unlimited time,
uh,
for,

269
00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:06.560
for a conversation changes.
Uh,
and also just different,
you know,

270
00:15:06.561 --> 00:15:09.470
incentives with respect to funding of these things because he knows there's no

271
00:15:09.471 --> 00:15:13.340
one,
no one's going to fire Joe Rogan,
Sam Harris identifiers.
I have iris.
Yeah,
no,

272
00:15:13.341 --> 00:15:17.090
not a well,
well I fired my,
uh,
my Twitter director,

273
00:15:18.630 --> 00:15:22.340
but,
um,
it's,
and so that,

274
00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:26.180
that part of the analogy is interesting because it's allowing for a very

275
00:15:26.181 --> 00:15:29.360
different style of Erin ideas and the,

276
00:15:29.361 --> 00:15:32.200
and the substance is changing,
you know?
And so,
uh,

277
00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:35.000
and I think people value it and be you,
you,
you know,

278
00:15:35.001 --> 00:15:40.001
when you're listening to one of our podcasts that you're getting a,

279
00:15:41.390 --> 00:15:45.020
a much less paranoid,
much less circumspect,

280
00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:47.370
much more,
uh,

281
00:15:50.070 --> 00:15:54.950
open ended ser search for sanity and,
and,
and,

282
00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:58.310
you know,
got kind of convergence between,
in some cases,

283
00:15:58.311 --> 00:16:02.390
radically different opinions.
Uh,
then you're getting in other media.

284
00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:05.890
<v 1>I like that open ended search for sanity because I think we've all tried to</v>

285
00:16:05.891 --> 00:16:08.290
figure out what are the commonalities here because right.
We've got,

286
00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:10.630
I mean you invented basically disagree on every,

287
00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:13.990
not only pretty much every political position,
not not everyone,

288
00:16:13.991 --> 00:16:17.230
but probably 90% of the political stuff do you and Ben Shapiro.
Uh,

289
00:16:17.231 --> 00:16:20.890
but of course also the existential stuff and religion and all that stuff.

290
00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:24.430
And yet you guys are basically allies in that.

291
00:16:24.431 --> 00:16:27.880
You're defending the ability to have that disagreement.

292
00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:31.560
That seems to me to be the thing that we're all doing.
Like we,

293
00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:33.190
we respect our audiences,

294
00:16:33.191 --> 00:16:37.810
but more than that we're respecting the ability for people to sit here and

295
00:16:37.811 --> 00:16:38.680
disagree about things.

296
00:16:38.681 --> 00:16:41.110
And we have a couple of political disagreements that I want to get into a little

297
00:16:41.111 --> 00:16:44.670
bit.
But to me those disagreements aren't even that important as long as we're

298
00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:48.010
defending the ability to think and question.

299
00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:50.470
And I think that's what we've all sort of done,

300
00:16:50.770 --> 00:16:52.810
even though we all came at it from very different places.

301
00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:54.100
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

302
00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:58.630
And I think the master variable for me is a good faith disagreement.

303
00:16:58.631 --> 00:16:59.490
So it's like,
it's where I like,

304
00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:04.070
I'm actually concerned to get your position right.
And again,

305
00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:08.410
some of this does,
I think boil down to not having a time limit too.

306
00:17:08.411 --> 00:17:11.600
It's like I can take the time,
it doesn't matter if you're like,
you know,

307
00:17:11.610 --> 00:17:16.360
with Peterson and I,
we can burn the first hour is understanding one another,

308
00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:19.030
right?
Or even longer.
Let me be the first whole podcast.

309
00:17:19.031 --> 00:17:21.640
And then we do another podcast,
which you,
so it's,
um,

310
00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:26.480
it's whereas in any other format,
you just,
you,

311
00:17:26.570 --> 00:17:31.570
you don't have the time to wonder whether or not your wrong about what you think

312
00:17:32.861 --> 00:17:36.550
the other person just said.
And then you add to that,
the,
the,

313
00:17:36.570 --> 00:17:40.930
the kind of the cynical point scoring that is just politically motivated,
uh,

314
00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:46.330
that is omnipresent.
And in the usual context,
you know,

315
00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:49.380
it,
you just have people who are actually not having a conversation.
Just,

316
00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:54.150
I'm going to say the thing that I think is going to make you look bad in the 45

317
00:17:54.151 --> 00:17:55.320
seconds we have left.

318
00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:59.400
That's the situation you're virtually always in on television.

319
00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:03.150
And people feel it.
And it's just like,
no wonder we're not making progress.

320
00:18:03.151 --> 00:18:04.920
Having conversations about hard topics.

321
00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:09.420
<v 1>Yeah.
Well I think we're making progress and we as a visitor,
as a species I do.</v>

322
00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:12.910
And say,
well yeah,
that reminds me.
Can you just quickly recap,

323
00:18:12.911 --> 00:18:15.610
you mentioned something on your podcast a couple of weeks ago about how when

324
00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:19.370
when Shapiro and Jordan were here that uh,

325
00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:23.020
that Jordan sort of misrepresented a position,

326
00:18:23.021 --> 00:18:26.650
your position sort of untruth and that Ben then subsequently on Twitter

327
00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:29.950
misrepresents saying you contacted both of them and cleaned it all up and

328
00:18:29.951 --> 00:18:33.170
everyone was good to go.
Can you just recap that real quick because I think,
yeah,

329
00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:37.390
sort of also gets to the heart of this that yes,
they,
they both kind of admitted,

330
00:18:37.391 --> 00:18:40.630
yeah,
we,
one thing was half joke and whatever we screwed up something,

331
00:18:40.631 --> 00:18:43.630
but that we all cleaned it up.
You guys all cleaned it up and we're good.

332
00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:45.760
And I think it's just important to reiterate.

333
00:18:46.510 --> 00:18:47.021
<v 0>Yeah.
Well,
I mean,</v>

334
00:18:47.021 --> 00:18:50.860
that's a point I made that point on my podcast to reiterate the difference

335
00:18:50.861 --> 00:18:55.861
between the kinds of bad faith arguments I'm getting predominantly from the left

336
00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:59.860
and what I'm getting from the right.
And I mean it was,

337
00:18:59.861 --> 00:19:03.710
I was actually provoked by a question on an Ama I got,
which actually it was,

338
00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:06.130
it was probably your hate mail.
You know,
I'm getting a,
some of them,

339
00:19:06.131 --> 00:19:08.970
some of your hate mails.
Right.
Weird that I forward that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well,
it's a,

340
00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:10.480
yeah.
You mean like I'm getting enough,

341
00:19:10.930 --> 00:19:15.370
I'm sure you've gotten some of mind in the past,
but someone was saying like,

342
00:19:15.371 --> 00:19:18.280
why are you hanging out with all these right wing people?

343
00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:23.080
And you seem to be able to have a congenial conversation with right wingers

344
00:19:23.081 --> 00:19:27.010
like,
and then the people on the list of right wingers were you and Rogan and,

345
00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:31.420
and that any more plausibly Ben Shapiro,
Jordan Peterson,

346
00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:35.780
<v 1>gay married pro choice against the death penalty and reforming the prison
system,</v>

347
00:19:35.810 --> 00:19:36.643
blah,
blah,
blah.
Right?

348
00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:39.740
<v 0>Yeah.
And wrote Rogan's Rogan's conservative Boehner paydays or don't,</v>

349
00:19:39.770 --> 00:19:44.540
don't go much further than that as well.
Uh,
but uh,
he hunts.
That's,

350
00:19:44.570 --> 00:19:49.520
that's what damn I guess.
Uh,
but so I,

351
00:19:49.521 --> 00:19:50.000
you know,

352
00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:55.000
why can't you have the same kind of good faith meeting of the minds with someone

353
00:19:55.101 --> 00:19:58.790
on the left and one like as recline or any of your other antagonists on the left

354
00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:00.440
and Glenn Greenwald or Chris Hedges.

355
00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:05.980
And the difference has been in my experience is that on the left I am virtually

356
00:20:07.431 --> 00:20:08.320
always getting,
I mean,

357
00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:13.340
just like 90% of the time at least I'm getting a,

358
00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:18.380
an argument that I perceive to be in bad faith where it's just there you're,

359
00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:22.730
the effort is to slime you with a view you don't hold or take the worst

360
00:20:22.731 --> 00:20:27.560
conceivable interpretation of the view you hold and hold you to that.
Like,

361
00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:29.960
I saw this thing,
you,
I heard this thing you said,

362
00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:33.290
I can interpret it to make you look like a fascist maniac.

363
00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:38.150
So and so now the burden is on you for forever to prove you're not a fascist

364
00:20:38.151 --> 00:20:39.620
maniac.
Right?
Yeah.
Pause

365
00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:41.770
<v 1>you there for a second.
Is there any chance that you think these,</v>

366
00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:43.780
forget the nit specifics of the people,

367
00:20:43.781 --> 00:20:46.750
but is there any chance you think that these people are

368
00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:52.000
<v 0>co like consciously good?
You know what I mean,</v>

369
00:20:52.001 --> 00:20:55.510
like that there that they really are just so deeply misunderstanding that this

370
00:20:55.511 --> 00:20:58.840
isn't an intention of evil in some gay.
I mean,
I,
I,

371
00:20:58.841 --> 00:21:01.360
we could sort of do the postmortem on some of these,

372
00:21:01.361 --> 00:21:06.361
but some I think are genuinely confused on think are truly sinister in their

373
00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:11.330
level of dishonesty.
Mean personally,
I think it's more of the latter.
But yeah,

374
00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:14.440
I mean,
I mean someone like Jank younger,
I think he's,

375
00:21:14.470 --> 00:21:17.060
he knows what he's doing and he's,
yeah,
he's a,

376
00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:20.890
he knows he's misleading his audience and you know,
it was just pure politics.
Uh,

377
00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:21.733
and I would,
you know,

378
00:21:21.910 --> 00:21:26.230
many people I could name or fall into that then I would agree with you.
But,

379
00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:30.910
uh,
so,
and then,
then the thing that that is,

380
00:21:30.970 --> 00:21:35.440
is totally toxic is what is when it's absolutely clear that someone has

381
00:21:35.441 --> 00:21:37.060
misrepresented your view.
Right?

382
00:21:37.061 --> 00:21:42.010
So like when Glenn Greenwald forwards to now in millions of people,

383
00:21:42.430 --> 00:21:47.430
a segment of my podcast that has been re edited by some Twitter troll to make me

384
00:21:48.670 --> 00:21:52.690
seem to be saying the opposite of what I'm saying.
In fact,
in the,
in context,
he,

385
00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:55.870
he'll never correct that error.
He'll,
and he'll never apologize.
Whereas I,

386
00:21:55.871 --> 00:21:59.170
you know,
we'll,
we'll apologize instantly if I've misrepresented him.
Um,

387
00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:03.220
the one time I did that,
you did it.
Yeah.
I mean,
you actually did do it.
Yeah.
Um,

388
00:22:03.850 --> 00:22:06.970
so,
uh,
there's just as asymmetric warfare,

389
00:22:06.971 --> 00:22:09.190
and so the point I made about Peterson and Shapiro,

390
00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:13.600
there's so they both came on your show and in one way or another,

391
00:22:13.601 --> 00:22:15.340
totally misrepresented my views may soap.

392
00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:19.070
So Peterson quite comically in my world said,
you know,
the,

393
00:22:19.071 --> 00:22:20.410
the thing about Sam Harrison,

394
00:22:20.450 --> 00:22:24.070
he doesn't understand that consciousness is mysterious.
He doesn't,

395
00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:25.020
he doesn't value [inaudible].

396
00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:29.980
He went on this whole tirade about Mike not getting just how mysterious and

397
00:22:29.981 --> 00:22:33.370
profound and,
and,
um,
uh,

398
00:22:33.790 --> 00:22:35.830
interesting consciousness is.

399
00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:41.070
Whereas anyone who knows my stuff knows that that's like the absolute center of

400
00:22:41.831 --> 00:22:45.030
the center of the Bullseye for me,
ethically and intellectually.
Uh,

401
00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:48.490
both as you know,
in terms of neuroscience and philosophy of mind,

402
00:22:48.910 --> 00:22:50.750
moral philosophy.
I mean that's just,
you know,
I've,

403
00:22:50.910 --> 00:22:54.490
I say things like consciousness is the one thing in this universe that can't be

404
00:22:54.491 --> 00:22:56.680
an illusion.
Right?
I mean,
we could be in a simulation,

405
00:22:56.681 --> 00:22:59.020
we could be brains and vads we could be confused about everything.

406
00:22:59.410 --> 00:23:02.790
The one thing we can't be confused about is that,
you know,
consciousness is,

407
00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:07.270
is our first,
you know,
condition in each instant.
Um,

408
00:23:07.870 --> 00:23:11.740
so,
so I just emailed him and I said like,
Dude,

409
00:23:11.741 --> 00:23:14.440
you've got me completely wrong on consciousness so you can get good cause you

410
00:23:14.441 --> 00:23:19.330
have to stop saying what you just said on Reuben's podcast because a,

411
00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:24.140
it makes no sense.
And rather than,
and this again,
if,

412
00:23:24.490 --> 00:23:29.290
if I were going out to someone on the left,
you know,
the Ezra Klein's,

413
00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:32.440
the raise os lawns,
the Genx,

414
00:23:32.441 --> 00:23:35.680
the Chris hedges that Glenn Greenwald's,
um,

415
00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:38.390
I like I was giving you the got to name via knows,

416
00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:41.890
but I mean I've been down this path so many times with these guys.
I mean,

417
00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:44.920
so the people think this all plays out in public and sometimes plays out in

418
00:23:44.930 --> 00:23:47.960
private without every one of these guys.
There's been a private communication,

419
00:23:47.961 --> 00:23:52.310
which is like,
listen,
this is objectively mistaken,
right?
Oh,
um,

420
00:23:53.630 --> 00:23:57.440
never have gotten an apology or a correction about anything.
Right.

421
00:23:57.441 --> 00:24:02.160
And what you get is basically fuck you.
This is what you really think.
You know,

422
00:24:02.190 --> 00:24:07.190
you,
you know,
and um,
but with Jordan knows,
sorry,

423
00:24:07.191 --> 00:24:09.430
I guess I have to read your book so I know what I'm talking about.
I said,

424
00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:12.680
I think that's verbatim.
And by the way,
he has now,
he told me,

425
00:24:12.681 --> 00:24:15.770
he told me last night,
so where he's read all your books,
little sees he's ready.

426
00:24:15.771 --> 00:24:18.640
I'm sure he's still confused about something and those quotes.

427
00:24:18.641 --> 00:24:22.490
But we'll work that out on stage.
But um,
and the same with Ben.

428
00:24:22.491 --> 00:24:26.300
Ben was saying something about,
um,
I think,
I think it was free.

429
00:24:26.301 --> 00:24:30.920
We'll joke right was right.
It was the joke about the kid.
Oh,
okay.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

430
00:24:30.921 --> 00:24:35.030
So I had at our event,
we got a question from the audience,

431
00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:39.230
which,
uh,
where someone asks,
well,
so if free will is an illusion,
you know,

432
00:24:39.231 --> 00:24:41.240
what should I tell my kids about free will?
Like,

433
00:24:41.370 --> 00:24:45.110
do you lie to your kids or do you,
uh,
and I,
I made,
I,
I joke,

434
00:24:45.111 --> 00:24:46.010
I said lie to them right.

435
00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:50.510
At which given the fact that I've written a book about lying and,
and my,

436
00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:53.750
I've taken a very public position that basically you never lie,

437
00:24:53.751 --> 00:24:54.850
you don't even tell white lies,

438
00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:58.620
lions on the continuum of violence and you just lie in,

439
00:24:58.670 --> 00:25:03.380
in real extremis,
uh,
and it got to be left by,

440
00:25:03.381 --> 00:25:05.820
they got got loud back there.
Everyone in the room recognize,

441
00:25:05.821 --> 00:25:08.150
everyone knew that I would,
my audience knew I was joking,

442
00:25:08.151 --> 00:25:10.610
but then didn't know I was joking.
Right.
So Ben,

443
00:25:10.611 --> 00:25:13.070
what left and did some subsequent interviews saying,
well,
you know,

444
00:25:13.130 --> 00:25:15.620
Sam Harris is remedy for this,
is that you just,
you know,

445
00:25:15.621 --> 00:25:17.170
he thinks free will is an illusion,
but you know,

446
00:25:17.171 --> 00:25:20.570
you should lie to your kids about it.
Right.
So I said,
Ben,

447
00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:22.820
that was a joke and you know,
he is,

448
00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:27.060
if he can certainly suggested in his email,
I haven't seen him since,
but it was,

449
00:25:27.061 --> 00:25:31.820
it seemed like he was going to stop doing that.
Whereas,
um,
again,

450
00:25:32.090 --> 00:25:34.790
this what I would absolutely expect,

451
00:25:34.791 --> 00:25:39.470
I mean like bet your life on expect to get from any of these other antagonists

452
00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:44.270
is,
sorry,
you said Lie,
right?
Like this is,

453
00:25:44.370 --> 00:25:47.930
I have the text right here,
I'm going to hold you to that.
Right.

454
00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:51.420
And this is,
this is happening across the board on,

455
00:25:51.421 --> 00:25:54.650
on far more substantial things like,
you know,
whether someone's a racist,

456
00:25:54.651 --> 00:25:55.630
whether it's,
it's like you,

457
00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:01.000
if it's possible to Parse your tweet or your statement or your bad joke as

458
00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:05.150
you're now a Nazi.
Yeah.
Right.

459
00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:07.940
That's what people are going to do to you until the end of time.

460
00:26:07.941 --> 00:26:09.340
And it's just there's,
there's no,
I mean,
I,

461
00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:15.250
I had been living under the illusion that it's possible to play your game so

462
00:26:15.410 --> 00:26:18.900
impeccably so as to close the door,
the door that ever happening.
Like,

463
00:26:18.901 --> 00:26:21.950
like that's like if I'm just going to,
if I just spoke clearly enough,

464
00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:26.780
if I just responded to enough of this crap,
right,

465
00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:31.160
this would stop happening.
I mean,
I never thought that I'm consciously,

466
00:26:31.161 --> 00:26:35.180
because it sounds ridiculous to say,
but,
but like that was a,

467
00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:39.470
that was tacitly presumed in how I was spending my time and energy trying to

468
00:26:39.471 --> 00:26:40.310
close the door to this stuff.

469
00:26:40.311 --> 00:26:44.130
And now I now I basically feel like almost nothing worth

470
00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:45.240
<v 1>responding to in that.
Yeah.</v>

471
00:26:45.450 --> 00:26:48.510
So when you look back to the time that you either thought that consciously or

472
00:26:48.511 --> 00:26:52.260
not,
does that just seem like naiveté or it just seems like just that the world

473
00:26:52.261 --> 00:26:57.261
seriously shifted partly because of social media where maybe maybe 15 years ago

474
00:26:57.421 --> 00:26:58.770
as someone that,
you know,

475
00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:03.120
staked out some unpopular positions or politically incorrect positions that you

476
00:27:03.121 --> 00:27:06.720
could do it,
you could clean it up in a way that you'd be basically insulated.

477
00:27:06.721 --> 00:27:09.870
But now just because of the craziness of social media,
it just doesn't exist.

478
00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:13.160
<v 0>Yeah,
I think it's really social media.
I think it's just</v>

479
00:27:14.710 --> 00:27:15.640
you.
I mean there's,

480
00:27:15.790 --> 00:27:19.630
there's never a comment thread that will be clean for you no matter what you do

481
00:27:19.631 --> 00:27:20.700
or say.
It's like,
so if,

482
00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:25.800
if your measure of a controversy worth responding to or stuff that wasn't clear

483
00:27:26.351 --> 00:27:30.340
enough because someone's still confused is what you see in a comment thread or

484
00:27:30.341 --> 00:27:34.210
what you've seen in your at mentions on Twitter,
you'll never be out of hell.

485
00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:39.130
So yeah.
So it was,
uh,
I could have just realized this years before I did,

486
00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:41.470
but it was,
it was a kind of,
you know,

487
00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:43.660
the frog in the boiling water or whether it didn't,

488
00:27:43.661 --> 00:27:47.440
didn't notice it was getting hot,
you know,
as you gradually heated it up.
So,
uh,

489
00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:50.020
I was that frog and I've since jumped out.

490
00:27:50.130 --> 00:27:55.130
<v 1>So what do you make then of that basic premise that you've laid out there that</v>

491
00:27:55.591 --> 00:27:59.820
for some reason,
whatever is happening on the left,
broadly speaking,

492
00:28:00.210 --> 00:28:04.380
is incapable of having honest conversations.
I mean,
do you at this point,

493
00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:06.090
one of the things when I do the Peterson event,

494
00:28:06.390 --> 00:28:09.240
and I do a little thing about the IDW and just this crew of people,

495
00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:13.740
and I say something about how we ever truly diverse group because we've got Sam

496
00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:16.320
Harris on the left and,
and Ben Shapiro on the right.

497
00:28:16.321 --> 00:28:19.900
And then I throw in a couple of Kanye jokes and some other stuff,
but in,

498
00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:22.710
so in my mind,
I guess you're still part of that.

499
00:28:22.711 --> 00:28:25.020
And I know the labels are all changing and that whole thing,

500
00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:27.330
but what do you make of what's happening on the left?

501
00:28:27.331 --> 00:28:31.800
And do you still consider yourself part of that thing that you're obviously

502
00:28:31.801 --> 00:28:34.980
really struggling with at some level?
Yeah.

503
00:28:35.210 --> 00:28:37.780
<v 0>Yeah,
I'd be,
I'm,
I'm basically a,</v>

504
00:28:37.850 --> 00:28:40.970
despite that I've said many things about politics over the years.

505
00:28:40.971 --> 00:28:45.971
I'm basically a political politics is the most boring thing in the universe.

506
00:28:46.011 --> 00:28:50.870
Right?
And,
and I've said this before,
one of the things that,

507
00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:54.430
I mean,
strange people actually say this is a good thing.
I mean,

508
00:28:54.431 --> 00:28:56.930
I think you've said this is a good thing.
I think this is a terrible thing.

509
00:28:56.931 --> 00:29:01.700
The fact that we're talking about politics so much is a sign of something bad.

510
00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:03.900
<v 1>No,
no,
I think it's terrible.
I just tweeted that the other day.</v>

511
00:29:03.901 --> 00:29:04.860
I think it's terrible.
Okay.

512
00:29:04.861 --> 00:29:07.880
So that's why I want small government so that it can't affect us them.

513
00:29:07.930 --> 00:29:08.763
<v 0>Okay.
But I thought you,</v>

514
00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:13.240
I thought you thought that the rise of Trump led to this level of new level of

515
00:29:13.241 --> 00:29:16.360
engagement with all these issues and that would be a good thing.
I think it's,

516
00:29:16.361 --> 00:29:17.170
I mean,
it's,
it's,

517
00:29:17.170 --> 00:29:20.380
it's bad that we have an uninformed electorate and that people are disengaged.

518
00:29:20.381 --> 00:29:23.080
I mean,
that's,
but,
uh,
the,
so you,

519
00:29:23.081 --> 00:29:25.990
obviously you want 100% of the people in the country to know,
you know,

520
00:29:25.991 --> 00:29:28.340
how government works.
I mean,
that would be great.
But yeah.
Um,

521
00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:33.720
the fact that politics is so important to people,

522
00:29:33.910 --> 00:29:36.490
the fact that their identity is wrapped up in it,
the fact that,

523
00:29:36.790 --> 00:29:40.480
that you just can't get away from it.
That's a sign of real dysfunction.

524
00:29:40.481 --> 00:29:44.720
That's a sign.
Things not working.
And so,
uh,
you know,
W in my war,
I mean it's,

525
00:29:44.750 --> 00:29:48.850
yeah,
I got sucked into that and I've said as much as you know,

526
00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:52.030
more or less everything I have to say on those issues.
I mean,

527
00:29:52.031 --> 00:29:54.550
they issues aren't changing fast enough for me to have to keep touching it.

528
00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:57.940
Right.
I mean,
Trump isn't that different than he was six months ago,

529
00:29:57.941 --> 00:30:01.090
so I don't have to keep talking about him,
but,
um,
I,

530
00:30:01.091 --> 00:30:03.670
it's just uh,
yeah,

531
00:30:03.671 --> 00:30:06.490
I mean I find it incredibly boring and repetitive and not,

532
00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:10.330
it doesn't really pay attention.
And I like,
like the,

533
00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:15.600
the noises you make seem ineffectual and there's not new in new knowledge coming

534
00:30:17.291 --> 00:30:19.960
your way based on those uses of attention.
So it's,
yeah,

535
00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:24.400
now I'm spending less time on it both just consuming it and putting stuff out

536
00:30:24.401 --> 00:30:25.190
there about it.

537
00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:28.340
<v 1>Yeah.
Where do you think that leads us?
Just as a society?</v>

538
00:30:28.341 --> 00:30:31.090
Like it does strike me as a sickness.
This,
you know,

539
00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:35.690
as a sort of societal sickness that everything has become political all the
time.

540
00:30:35.870 --> 00:30:39.360
So I do the first part of what you said there I do think is good.

541
00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:41.450
The Trump thing that came in and broke everything up.

542
00:30:41.451 --> 00:30:44.000
The idea that so many people are reevaluating what they think.

543
00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:45.680
That's what I would say is good.

544
00:30:45.950 --> 00:30:49.850
The fact that everything now has become political in sports is absurdly

545
00:30:49.851 --> 00:30:53.540
political now and every TV show and movie and everything,

546
00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:55.700
just nonstop,
endless.

547
00:30:55.701 --> 00:30:59.930
That I think is dangerous because it's just putting up barriers everywhere.

548
00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:03.620
How do we,
how do we sort of bring some of that back?

549
00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:07.120
<v 0>Well,
I just think [inaudible] again,</v>

550
00:31:07.130 --> 00:31:11.690
we have to resist the slide into politicizing everything.

551
00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:16.770
I think it's the people who are not taken in by the,
I mean it's,

552
00:31:16.780 --> 00:31:21.780
it's disconcerting how many of the examples that come readily to mind are on one

553
00:31:21.861 --> 00:31:23.150
side of the political spectrum.
I,

554
00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:27.200
it's like as someone who's on the left with respect to almost every variable

555
00:31:27.201 --> 00:31:31.280
that can define left and that's what I'm trying to,
it's so much of it is,

556
00:31:31.281 --> 00:31:32.031
is the left,

557
00:31:32.031 --> 00:31:37.031
but the truth is the left is so dominant in journalism and entertainment that

558
00:31:40.340 --> 00:31:43.220
it's kind of high culture academia as well.
It's like,

559
00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:43.930
it's like if you're going to be,

560
00:31:43.930 --> 00:31:48.170
if you can talk about the sources of knowledge and the sources of information

561
00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:51.380
that if you know here to forbidden,
considered valid,
uh,

562
00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:56.480
and then the sources of entertainment.
Um,
your,
you know,
I mean,

563
00:31:56.481 --> 00:32:00.560
I don't know how sports breaks,
but you know,
sports,
uh,
maybe,
um,

564
00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:04.060
maybe sport by sport it might change,
but,
um,

565
00:32:04.940 --> 00:32:08.870
you're talking about a disparate disproportionate influence from the left.

566
00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:13.900
And that's how that's undoubtedly a source of the cluelessness that the left had

567
00:32:14.601 --> 00:32:16.820
about,
you know,
what was going on in the country and the,

568
00:32:16.821 --> 00:32:21.180
and the prospects of Trump winning the election.
You know,
I think that was,
um,

569
00:32:21.570 --> 00:32:24.950
just the naturally and echo chamber effect.
But,

570
00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:26.700
<v 1>so I think for most people that are watching this,</v>

571
00:32:26.701 --> 00:32:28.380
they're probably agree with you,
right?

572
00:32:28.381 --> 00:32:31.410
Most of my audience is going to agree with that diagnosis.

573
00:32:32.010 --> 00:32:33.630
Do you think the powers that be,

574
00:32:33.631 --> 00:32:38.631
whether it's in the media world or the political establishment or the,

575
00:32:39.170 --> 00:32:42.290
whatever's happening at the universities,
are they getting the message yet?

576
00:32:42.291 --> 00:32:47.060
Do you have any hope that they're actually realizing how toxic this thing has

577
00:32:47.061 --> 00:32:47.894
become?

578
00:32:48.150 --> 00:32:51.810
<v 0>Well,
they're,
they're getting the message that there's a problem,</v>

579
00:32:51.990 --> 00:32:56.990
but my concern is that the left seems totally capable of just taking a pendulum

580
00:32:57.721 --> 00:33:02.340
swing in the other direction into leftist identity politics.
I think,
you know,

581
00:33:02.430 --> 00:33:06.450
it's hard to know how fully the left has been captured by that,

582
00:33:06.451 --> 00:33:11.140
but uh,
it's mean the reaction to Trump,
you know,

583
00:33:11.230 --> 00:33:15.210
Trump and the left are now mirror images of one of those right now.

584
00:33:15.250 --> 00:33:19.980
And it's,
I mean,
the answer to Trump can't be,

585
00:33:20.410 --> 00:33:23.460
and just take it out of tr off Trump for a second.

586
00:33:23.461 --> 00:33:28.461
Just the answer to the excesses of your identity politics and populism and

587
00:33:28.801 --> 00:33:33.750
unreasoned on the right,
you know,
can't be amplifying all of that on the left.

588
00:33:33.810 --> 00:33:35.030
I just think that's it.
I think it's,

589
00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:39.690
I think it will be just in fact a losing strategy going forward.
And it's just,

590
00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:43.470
it's just,
it is more of a,

591
00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:46.320
I mean,
it's a more,

592
00:33:46.350 --> 00:33:50.910
it's more of a renunciation of everything that makes the left good than it is on

593
00:33:50.911 --> 00:33:52.920
the right.
So like if you go far enough,
right,

594
00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:56.610
you're not expecting to meet kind of rational,

595
00:33:56.611 --> 00:33:59.800
open ended conversation about the nature of reality,
right?

596
00:33:59.830 --> 00:34:01.000
You're expecting to meet,
you know,

597
00:34:01.130 --> 00:34:05.970
neo Nazis and the KKK and that's what you in fact meet.
Right?
Uh,

598
00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.070
but my problem is I'm,

599
00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:13.160
I'm meeting the s the same level of demagoguery and dishonesty and cynicism and

600
00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:20.070
just mere gamesmanship on the left in a much,

601
00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:24.210
much closer to to where,
you know,
we all are living like,

602
00:34:24.211 --> 00:34:29.010
so it's like just in interacting with a reporter from,
you know,
Salon or,

603
00:34:29.011 --> 00:34:32.850
or vox,
right?
Like,
like,
like who's,
who's there,

604
00:34:33.330 --> 00:34:37.410
I'm meeting someone who essentially has the intellectual and moral integrity,

605
00:34:37.411 --> 00:34:39.400
but the guy in the white hood,
you know,

606
00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:43.580
over on the right and that asymmetry is,
uh,

607
00:34:43.670 --> 00:34:46.860
is just totally alarming to me.
Yeah.
So I know,
so we'll just do it,

608
00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:47.460
do a couple more minutes

609
00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:49.020
<v 1>on politics,
shift to some stuff.</v>

610
00:34:49.021 --> 00:34:52.950
So one of the places where obviously we're not completely lined up is sort of

611
00:34:53.010 --> 00:34:56.790
the Trump stuff and the reaction to all of this.
I think as human beings,

612
00:34:56.791 --> 00:35:00.120
I don't think it particularly matters to either one of us what those differences

613
00:35:00.121 --> 00:35:00.391
might be,

614
00:35:00.391 --> 00:35:04.770
but I know our audiences have a little bit of a different feeling on that

615
00:35:04.771 --> 00:35:08.970
perhaps.
Um,
so my general feeling,
again,
I did not vote for Trump.

616
00:35:08.971 --> 00:35:10.380
I voted for Gary Johnson.

617
00:35:10.381 --> 00:35:15.060
I would have preferred having a president who I think really understands three

618
00:35:15.061 --> 00:35:18.600
branches of government and the history of America and all of those simple
things.

619
00:35:18.601 --> 00:35:21.420
And that would've been nice in the debates if anyone would've said to him,

620
00:35:21.421 --> 00:35:24.120
do you know what the difference between the legislative and executive and

621
00:35:24.121 --> 00:35:25.950
judicial branches are?
And I think that may be,

622
00:35:26.070 --> 00:35:28.110
could have caused an implosion of the whole thing and all that.

623
00:35:28.350 --> 00:35:29.610
But that being said,

624
00:35:29.611 --> 00:35:34.410
I think the wrecking ball that he put through the machine that was dming us all

625
00:35:34.411 --> 00:35:34.861
down,

626
00:35:34.861 --> 00:35:38.730
that was creating this identity politics situation and everything else that had

627
00:35:38.731 --> 00:35:42.900
been so corroded into the system.
I think where we're at now,

628
00:35:42.901 --> 00:35:47.100
I'm quite hopeful.
I actually sense a lot of fertility for ideas.

629
00:35:47.101 --> 00:35:52.101
I think the fact that this whole crew of people has come together or whether

630
00:35:52.141 --> 00:35:53.940
we're independent or together,
whatever you want to call it,

631
00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:58.470
the fact that there's such interest in all of this,
uh,
I think is all good.

632
00:35:58.471 --> 00:36:03.471
And I see that as sort of a direct result of Trump just shaking up the system.

633
00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:08.730
That being said,
does he lie all the time?
Absolutely.

634
00:36:08.850 --> 00:36:10.710
Do I think they all lie all the time.
Yeah.

635
00:36:10.711 --> 00:36:13.470
That Obama lie about if you like your doctor you can keep it.
Yeah.

636
00:36:13.471 --> 00:36:14.820
The Syrian red line,
blah blah blah.

637
00:36:14.821 --> 00:36:18.720
It's just Trump does a different series of lies and does the much more blatantly

638
00:36:19.410 --> 00:36:22.980
[inaudible] necessary either.
I guess

639
00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:26.430
<v 0>I can't give you that last thing on,
on the scale of the line.
Cause I think it's,</v>

640
00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:28.680
it's orders of magnitude worse.

641
00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:31.530
I mean like not even just one order of magnitude worse.

642
00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:33.690
It's like a hundred fold worse with Trump.

643
00:36:33.810 --> 00:36:36.660
<v 1>So all right.
So if you take those two though,
so if you like your doctor,</v>

644
00:36:36.661 --> 00:36:41.250
you can keep your doctor.
Obamacare,
obviously it was his biggest public policy,

645
00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:44.850
domestic public policy thing.
So that's a pretty big lie.

646
00:36:44.851 --> 00:36:47.910
And they pretty much admitted that he knew he was saying it because,

647
00:36:48.750 --> 00:36:49.520
<v 0>yeah,
I mean,
whether,</v>

648
00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:52.360
whether that was a lie or not or whether he just reneged on a promise or I'd be

649
00:36:52.370 --> 00:36:54.400
like the red line.
I don't really do as a lie.

650
00:36:54.401 --> 00:36:56.260
I just view that as a failure of nerve.

651
00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:59.330
It's like he drew a red line that he probably shouldn't have drawn because he,

652
00:36:59.331 --> 00:37:04.090
he,
he,
if he thought about it,
he knew he wasn't going to go to war over it.
Um,

653
00:37:04.270 --> 00:37:08.070
and then he made us look weak because he didn't,
you know,

654
00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:13.090
he hit the line was crossed and we didn't respond.
Um,
I think that was,

655
00:37:13.690 --> 00:37:18.340
but it's just where we were living in a world where you would have a whole new

656
00:37:18.341 --> 00:37:21.700
cycle over Obama wearing a tan suit.
Right.

657
00:37:22.100 --> 00:37:25.930
And now we're living in a world where a porn star can say,
listen,
you know,

658
00:37:25.931 --> 00:37:30.190
he's lying about this and I have evidence and it's like,

659
00:37:30.250 --> 00:37:34.600
it's so it is eclipsed by the next lie he tells by the end of the bad news
cycle.

660
00:37:34.630 --> 00:37:37.950
Right.
So it's just,
um,
I mean you,
I mean,

661
00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:42.960
it's literally true to say that Obama's presidency would have been completely

662
00:37:43.661 --> 00:37:48.661
derailed by anyone of maybe a hundred things you could say Donald Trump has said

663
00:37:49.991 --> 00:37:54.310
or done in the last year.
I mean,
not,
I mean,
way beyond 10 things.
I mean,
I,

664
00:37:54.340 --> 00:37:55.750
you know,
I can't list them now,

665
00:37:55.751 --> 00:38:00.550
but I mean almost anything he does on a weekly basis,
if not a daily basis.

666
00:38:00.940 --> 00:38:05.940
Had you seen Obama do it in that period of the earth that we can call the deadly

667
00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:06.730
recollect?

668
00:38:06.730 --> 00:38:09.460
<v 1>Would it really derailed in Obama presidency?</v>

669
00:38:09.461 --> 00:38:11.470
Because to me it was like the media was so far up his,

670
00:38:11.471 --> 00:38:14.470
but they could have pretty much gotten away with anything.
Well,

671
00:38:14.670 --> 00:38:15.720
I get what you're saying.
Yeah.

672
00:38:15.730 --> 00:38:18.670
They focused on Tan suits and s and silly nonsense.
But to me,

673
00:38:18.671 --> 00:38:22.270
I see that as almost like it's because you guys weren't doing your job,

674
00:38:22.271 --> 00:38:24.940
you should have been digging a little bit more or whatever.

675
00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:25.531
<v 0>Well,
no,
but I,</v>

676
00:38:25.531 --> 00:38:30.531
I think it's actually true to say that Obama was basically a,

677
00:38:30.890 --> 00:38:35.530
you know,
as honest as a politician can be and still be a politician.
I mean,

678
00:38:35.531 --> 00:38:38.540
I think,
I'm sure he lied about things,
right?
Yeah.
But there's,

679
00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:43.600
there's no story on Obama being just this depraved person behind closed doors

680
00:38:44.740 --> 00:38:46.780
who get,
who's a,
who's a con artist,

681
00:38:46.781 --> 00:38:50.140
who gets away with everything that he can get away with.
Uh,

682
00:38:50.170 --> 00:38:54.820
who's trailing a long list of,
you know,
business and interpersonal casualties.

683
00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:58.270
Who will tell you if you put them on camera or you can't get them privately.

684
00:38:58.490 --> 00:39:02.110
They,
he's the worst person they've ever met.
Right.
That's his president now.

685
00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:07.210
Right.
It's just that it's a completely different personality.
Um,
and,

686
00:39:07.810 --> 00:39:11.830
uh,
I think that,
I think so whatever happens,
let's say good.

687
00:39:11.930 --> 00:39:16.870
Let's say we're living in a universe where having a,

688
00:39:17.860 --> 00:39:21.340
a uniquely narcissistic,
selfish,

689
00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:26.700
shallow personality in this position of power works out.

690
00:39:27.910 --> 00:39:29.170
Well,
let's just say that I mean a lot.

691
00:39:29.171 --> 00:39:32.140
So let's just take your wrecking ball theory.
He's kind of swung through here.

692
00:39:32.410 --> 00:39:35.510
He's disrupted everything.
You know,
I do view him,
as I said,

693
00:39:35.511 --> 00:39:37.930
I've said before as a kind of evil Chauncey Gardner character.

694
00:39:37.931 --> 00:39:39.480
I don't view him as this sort of mass.

695
00:39:39.790 --> 00:39:42.250
I think Scott Adams is completely out to lunch on this.

696
00:39:42.251 --> 00:39:45.370
I don't think he's this genius manipulator.
I mean,
he's got,

697
00:39:45.730 --> 00:39:47.890
he's got some talents obviously,

698
00:39:48.890 --> 00:39:52.950
but I think you think it's much less calculating,
much less calculus.
Yeah.

699
00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:57.430
I don't think him contradicting himself.
Two sentences later,
right when he says,

700
00:39:57.431 --> 00:39:59.050
you know this amazing letter,

701
00:39:59.051 --> 00:40:01.600
you'd all like to read this letter and then he says two sentences later.

702
00:40:01.810 --> 00:40:05.020
I haven't read the letter.
That's not calculated.
He's just not,

703
00:40:05.021 --> 00:40:08.460
doesn't have the cog.
He can't take the cognitive overhead.

704
00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:09.850
Even figure out what you know,

705
00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:13.600
what was logically implied by the last thing you said.
Right.
So He's,

706
00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:17.200
the truth is he's not,
he lies all the time,

707
00:40:17.650 --> 00:40:19.030
but worse than line.

708
00:40:19.031 --> 00:40:22.330
And this is the great distinction that the philosopher Harry Frankfurt made in

709
00:40:22.331 --> 00:40:26.980
his book on Bullshit.
Worse than line is that he's bullshitting all the time.

710
00:40:26.981 --> 00:40:29.180
And the difference between line and bullshitting is it,

711
00:40:29.181 --> 00:40:33.940
if I'm going to lie to you,
I'm paying attention to what I know.

712
00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:35.800
React.
I know what is true.

713
00:40:35.801 --> 00:40:40.801
I know you know what is true and I'm trying to insert a lye into the space

714
00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:44.500
provided in a way that you won't notice.
Right?

715
00:40:44.501 --> 00:40:48.700
Like I'm having to keep track of reality in order to lie to you successfully.

716
00:40:48.940 --> 00:40:52.660
I understand your logical expectations.
I understand that.

717
00:40:52.661 --> 00:40:55.420
If I tell you that,
you know,

718
00:40:55.421 --> 00:40:58.540
I was an hour late here because the traffic was so bad.

719
00:40:58.780 --> 00:41:03.220
I can't say in the next sentence,
oh,
I left an hour late from my house.
Right?

720
00:41:03.221 --> 00:41:07.960
So like so,
um,
uh,
so the bullshit or isn't doing any of that,

721
00:41:07.961 --> 00:41:12.961
that bullshit or is just talking right and therefore has renounced the reality

722
00:41:13.991 --> 00:41:17.480
testing he has to do to live successfully and he's just,
he,

723
00:41:17.690 --> 00:41:22.570
he has the burden is not on him to make any sense at all in the end.
And um,

724
00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:26.140
that to an amazing degree,
not entirely,

725
00:41:26.141 --> 00:41:28.780
I think he does actually lie strategically sometimes.

726
00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:32.950
But to an amazing degree and this is what I think is so harmful about his,

727
00:41:33.470 --> 00:41:38.470
whatever happens with North Korea or anything else that we might care about to

728
00:41:38.871 --> 00:41:39.800
an amazing degree.

729
00:41:39.830 --> 00:41:44.830
He has revealed that half of our society will accept somebody who is just

730
00:41:46.850 --> 00:41:51.710
bullshitting all the time about things.
Great and small.
I mean,

731
00:41:51.711 --> 00:41:56.420
it doesn't matter how important or how inconsequential porn stars,
you know,
what,

732
00:41:56.421 --> 00:41:58.310
you know,
what just happened with the g seven,

733
00:41:58.311 --> 00:42:02.240
you know what was said behind closed doors,
what he's going to say to,
to uh,

734
00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:07.280
some maniac with,
with nukes.
Um,
there's just a,

735
00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:12.340
we've completely forsaken any expectation of a reality based conversation and

736
00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:17.780
many people seem to revel in it.
Many people seem to think this is just,

737
00:42:18.350 --> 00:42:20.750
this is just good fun.
This is like,
this is,
you know,

738
00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:26.200
it's a bit of the wrecking ball theory gone to some nihilistic extreme where

739
00:42:26.661 --> 00:42:31.160
it's just,
let's just,
you know,
let's just burn it all out.
You know,
like,

740
00:42:31.170 --> 00:42:33.200
like there's just nothing,
you know,
that there's nothing,

741
00:42:33.201 --> 00:42:35.960
there was nothing we're worth maintaining about our institutions,

742
00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:40.340
about our norms,
about our traditions,
about,
you know,
the expectations of our,

743
00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:44.150
of our,
of other countries that are allies,
you know,
or like,
who cares if,

744
00:42:44.270 --> 00:42:48.770
if all of our traditional allies don't know what to think about the president

745
00:42:48.771 --> 00:42:52.250
because he said one thing five minutes ago and he says the opposite thing now.

746
00:42:52.550 --> 00:42:55.040
And they're all left with our jaws on the floor.
Right?

747
00:42:55.280 --> 00:42:59.930
That's just comedy for what,
40% of America?

748
00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:04.450
Um,
I think there's a real consequence to that.
Cause I,
the,
because what,
what,

749
00:43:04.451 --> 00:43:09.451
what Trump has revealed is that there's a space for a truly terrible calculating

750
00:43:11.391 --> 00:43:16.370
person,
you know,
like the sinister person with a real ideology,

751
00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:20.510
not just someone potentially worse than him.
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.
I mean,
we've just,

752
00:43:20.540 --> 00:43:25.540
we've proven to ourselves that literally anyone who,

753
00:43:26.340 --> 00:43:28.160
who can connect certain dots,
I mean,

754
00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:31.730
anyone who can connect the dots of,
you know,

755
00:43:31.780 --> 00:43:34.390
I'm not even sure what these dots are,
but I mean,
obviously Trump connected,

756
00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:38.540
some of them,
you know,
fame.
And,
and a certain kind of charisma,

757
00:43:39.020 --> 00:43:43.210
um,
you know,
the,
a kind of populist,

758
00:43:43.260 --> 00:43:48.140
an ability to,
to,
to strike the populous note in a way that's compelling.

759
00:43:48.530 --> 00:43:53.530
Someone who's could be way worse and way smarter and have a very different

760
00:43:55.850 --> 00:44:00.320
agenda,
um,
uh,
can become president.

761
00:44:00.321 --> 00:44:02.960
And I think that's,
you know,
I mean it's good perhaps it's good to know that,

762
00:44:02.961 --> 00:44:03.720
but it's just,
I think

763
00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:08.700
<v 1>we now know that about ourselves.
Yeah.
Is this then weird?
So I think,</v>

764
00:44:08.701 --> 00:44:08.971
you know,

765
00:44:08.971 --> 00:44:12.180
that I'm certainly not a nihilist and I'm definitely not somebody that wanted to

766
00:44:12.181 --> 00:44:13.390
burn the whole thing down,
but I,

767
00:44:13.420 --> 00:44:18.420
but I do view this reckoning as basically good as long as this,

768
00:44:19.080 --> 00:44:22.610
this other person doesn't magically appear out of it.
And I also sense that,

769
00:44:22.940 --> 00:44:27.600
that the time of craziness that we're in right now and this endless inability to

770
00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:31.590
have these honest conversations and I,
and I agree with you on his basic

771
00:44:33.210 --> 00:44:35.630
management of truth or whatever you want,
whatever you want.

772
00:44:35.650 --> 00:44:37.590
Management of treatment is an interesting phrase,

773
00:44:37.591 --> 00:44:42.591
but whatever that is that I sense there is going to be a rebound towards sanity

774
00:44:44.430 --> 00:44:48.090
that at some point you can't always have the wrecking ball always have the guy

775
00:44:48.091 --> 00:44:52.110
that's flipping everything over and destroying it and that if our institutions

776
00:44:52.111 --> 00:44:56.610
are strong enough and if there's enough sane people out there and enough people

777
00:44:56.611 --> 00:45:00.060
that are listening to thoughtful conversations and I think we both agree there's

778
00:45:00.061 --> 00:45:04.560
a lot of people are growing in that regard that the next version of whatever

779
00:45:04.561 --> 00:45:08.700
happens at an election is going to come from something much saner.

780
00:45:09.510 --> 00:45:09.890
Yeah.

781
00:45:09.890 --> 00:45:14.610
I think the scenery from before where we were before because that's where we

782
00:45:14.611 --> 00:45:18.030
were just getting a lot of bullshit from the media and from everything else that

783
00:45:18.031 --> 00:45:22.080
we might actually get a rebounded to sanity.
No,
cause I,

784
00:45:22.081 --> 00:45:23.070
what I see is the,

785
00:45:23.100 --> 00:45:26.160
the Republican party has been destroyed by the Republican Party,

786
00:45:26.161 --> 00:45:31.080
has become Trump's party answers this populous pandering.
Uh,

787
00:45:31.170 --> 00:45:36.090
I mean they're just all trying to figure out what to do in his wake.
But nobody,

788
00:45:36.091 --> 00:45:40.800
I mean this,
there's no coherent platform anymore there.
And as we've said,

789
00:45:40.801 --> 00:45:45.500
the left has swung into this,
uh,
insane,
just,

790
00:45:45.690 --> 00:45:50.670
just victimology,
echo chamber of identity politics where everyone's a racist,

791
00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:52.650
right?
So,
um,

792
00:45:52.710 --> 00:45:56.460
I guess maybe that's sort of the root of where our little disconnect is on this

793
00:45:56.461 --> 00:45:58.470
cause I fear that much more.

794
00:45:58.890 --> 00:46:01.590
I think that that thing that's happening on the left,

795
00:46:01.591 --> 00:46:02.850
this identity politics thing,

796
00:46:02.851 --> 00:46:07.851
I think that's the thing that could actually truly upend the entire American

797
00:46:07.951 --> 00:46:08.490
experiment.

798
00:46:08.490 --> 00:46:11.730
The idea that we would end up looking at each other only on these immutable

799
00:46:11.731 --> 00:46:16.410
characteristics and hiring each other only on these things and having quotas and

800
00:46:16.411 --> 00:46:17.410
ripping apart the,

801
00:46:17.411 --> 00:46:21.860
the good pieces of multiculturalism that we've done here better than anybody and

802
00:46:21.870 --> 00:46:23.340
the melting pot that we've done better,

803
00:46:23.790 --> 00:46:28.790
that I will cause us to all be horrifically suspicious of each other and angry

804
00:46:29.161 --> 00:46:29.994
at each other.

805
00:46:30.180 --> 00:46:34.650
Really for no reason other than the way we look and I'm not discounting anything

806
00:46:34.651 --> 00:46:36.150
you're saying about what's happening on the right.

807
00:46:36.151 --> 00:46:39.690
Although I do see a streak of libertarianism on the right that I really like.

808
00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:42.210
I think there actually has been a rebirth.
You know,

809
00:46:42.211 --> 00:46:47.211
a guy like Shapiro is obviously not a real Trump guy at heart and he's arguing a

810
00:46:47.641 --> 00:46:50.430
lot of libertarians stuff that I like.
I mean maybe you don't like it as much.

811
00:46:50.630 --> 00:46:53.970
I think it's a decent place to be arguing from,

812
00:46:54.570 --> 00:46:57.780
but I guess maybe that is where our,
our little disconnected is on that,

813
00:46:57.781 --> 00:47:00.780
that the thing on the left eye view as much scarier.

814
00:47:00.781 --> 00:47:03.270
I think it's a much more of an immediate threat.

815
00:47:03.450 --> 00:47:06.360
And I say that knowing full well that Trump has the nuclear codes.

816
00:47:06.570 --> 00:47:09.090
So maybe that's,
maybe that's a little,
yeah,

817
00:47:09.091 --> 00:47:11.750
I mean I think they're both enormous problems.
I don't know which,
I mean,

818
00:47:11.751 --> 00:47:16.680
you know,
the Trump thing could seem fine until something horrific happens,

819
00:47:16.710 --> 00:47:19.260
right?
So it's like,
and you know,

820
00:47:19.770 --> 00:47:24.770
it's just how it is in fact hard to know what's happening and what risks we're

821
00:47:25.321 --> 00:47:30.130
running.
So it was like,
you know,
the economy seems to be doing good.
What metric

822
00:47:30.130 --> 00:47:33.670
<v 0>by that the stock market has imploded,
right?
So,
but only</v>

823
00:47:33.980 --> 00:47:36.070
<v 1>consumer confidence is high.
Black and Latino women</v>

824
00:47:36.130 --> 00:47:37.980
<v 0>climate is really low.
I mean they,</v>

825
00:47:38.250 --> 00:47:42.250
there are ways to parse all of those numbers that,
that are less optimistic.

826
00:47:42.251 --> 00:47:42.551
So you know,

827
00:47:42.551 --> 00:47:45.280
like the employment numbers are low because lots of people just falling out of

828
00:47:45.340 --> 00:47:48.190
the job search,
but,
and the,
you know,
the stock market,

829
00:47:48.500 --> 00:47:51.860
I think there's something like 8% of Americans are in the stock market.
You know,

830
00:47:51.861 --> 00:47:55.860
there's like 92% of Americans are not even exposed to the stock market.
Right.

831
00:47:56.230 --> 00:48:00.610
Or at least directly.
So,
um,
those numbers could be a little off,

832
00:48:00.611 --> 00:48:03.840
but it's something like that.
The,
um,

833
00:48:04.750 --> 00:48:09.350
but all of that would change radically the moment.
Something,
you know,

834
00:48:09.570 --> 00:48:13.100
the,
the left's worse fears about Trump or realize them,

835
00:48:13.101 --> 00:48:15.700
but the moment he does something that just gets,
you know,

836
00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:20.500
gets us far closer to obvious,
you know,
war or actually into one.

837
00:48:20.890 --> 00:48:25.540
Um,
and it's clearly the wrong war.
Uh,
you know,
the fact that,

838
00:48:25.950 --> 00:48:30.950
I mean,
I think,
I think that the,
the u s no longer stand,

839
00:48:31.230 --> 00:48:32.830
at least in the eyes of the world,

840
00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:38.280
the US no longer stands for sanity on some fundamental questions of human values

841
00:48:38.891 --> 00:48:40.360
and be like,
you know,
whether it's,
you know,

842
00:48:40.420 --> 00:48:43.870
climate change and environmentalism and doing something sane with respect to

843
00:48:43.871 --> 00:48:48.730
that or,
um,
you know,
human rights.
I mean,
he just,
he just took a meeting with,

844
00:48:49.510 --> 00:48:54.290
with,
uh,
the perhaps the greatest human rights violator.
Uh,

845
00:48:55.240 --> 00:48:58.580
certainly the current generation.
Um,
and humor,

846
00:48:58.770 --> 00:49:02.200
it's just clear now that the US will,

847
00:49:02.710 --> 00:49:07.710
will glad hand a dictator and say nothing about the fact that he's running a

848
00:49:08.921 --> 00:49:13.750
gulag system and they have been for,
for decades,
uh,
that used to,

849
00:49:13.751 --> 00:49:16.240
they used to be on thinkable and that's,
and that,
that,

850
00:49:16.540 --> 00:49:21.310
that extinguishes a certain hope of kind of moral high ground that the rest of

851
00:49:21.311 --> 00:49:24.370
the world,
I think rightly t depended on us for.

852
00:49:24.371 --> 00:49:27.590
And given the current occupant of the Oval Office,
you know,

853
00:49:27.640 --> 00:49:31.070
we've completely abandoned that.
So I think,
but it's hard to,

854
00:49:31.150 --> 00:49:34.260
it's hard to price in those changes.
I don't know what the consequences of,

855
00:49:34.290 --> 00:49:35.230
of all of that is.

856
00:49:35.340 --> 00:49:38.610
<v 1>Right.
So I guess the part that still seems odd to me is like,
you know,</v>

857
00:49:38.611 --> 00:49:42.570
when Obama ran,
he said,
you know,
we have to sit down with these people.

858
00:49:42.571 --> 00:49:47.160
He said he wanted to sit down with doc Medinah job,
no,
with no,
uh,
you know,

859
00:49:47.220 --> 00:49:51.150
no prior discussions or whatever.
That's basically what Trump did here.

860
00:49:51.151 --> 00:49:54.540
Now I'm not saying Trump's the right guy to do it,
maybe is in some insane way,

861
00:49:54.541 --> 00:49:55.500
and maybe it isn't.

862
00:49:55.790 --> 00:49:58.730
<v 0>But Obama,
most of those cases,
there would've been some,
uh,</v>

863
00:49:58.790 --> 00:50:02.750
lambasting of the person about human rights.
You know,
it's like the standard,

864
00:50:02.760 --> 00:50:06.740
if it was Hillary Clinton doing any of these things,
yeah.
At least you know,

865
00:50:07.130 --> 00:50:10.700
there would be
the norm of,

866
00:50:10.701 --> 00:50:13.700
of acknowledging that,
that,
I mean,

867
00:50:13.701 --> 00:50:18.701
so somebody will just compare what Trump said about Kim Jong on the statements

868
00:50:18.831 --> 00:50:21.540
were eating cake to what's actually going on.
I mean,
so,

869
00:50:21.550 --> 00:50:24.620
so we have someone who is presiding over these,

870
00:50:24.770 --> 00:50:28.810
the starvation and just,
yeah,
I mean beyond or well,

871
00:50:28.811 --> 00:50:30.230
and immiseration of his people.

872
00:50:30.231 --> 00:50:34.820
And it's like if you are caught saying the wrong thing or passing the wrong book

873
00:50:34.821 --> 00:50:35.421
to your neighbor,

874
00:50:35.421 --> 00:50:39.800
or if you tune your radio to receive a broadcast from South Korea,

875
00:50:40.340 --> 00:50:44.870
you're sent to the Gulag and your progeny are sent to the Gulag and they're down

876
00:50:44.871 --> 00:50:49.610
to the third generation.
Right?
I mean,
that's,
that's the punishment for this.
Uh,

877
00:50:49.700 --> 00:50:51.350
and,
uh,

878
00:50:51.770 --> 00:50:56.770
we have the president United States saying that he's a great guy.

879
00:50:57.591 --> 00:51:01.430
He's a,
he's an intelligent guy.
He loves his people.

880
00:51:01.520 --> 00:51:05.210
And that's a verbatim quote.
He loves his people.
I'm not surprised by that.

881
00:51:05.390 --> 00:51:10.240
I mean it's just,
it's like I don't even know what I mean.
Is there,

882
00:51:10.250 --> 00:51:12.260
is there anyone in this country

883
00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:13.473
<v 2>who,</v>

884
00:51:14.210 --> 00:51:19.210
<v 0>I mean it's just like there's so many layers at which we have lost sight of</v>

885
00:51:19.391 --> 00:51:22.480
reality here.
That's like,
it's a,
I don't know where the free fall stops.

886
00:51:22.481 --> 00:51:27.220
Like on one level there's a sense that
he's,

887
00:51:27.280 --> 00:51:31.180
he's lying,
right?
Like he's saying something he knew us know is untrue.
Right?

888
00:51:31.181 --> 00:51:35.770
So like he,
he knows what's going on.
He knows what life is like in North Korea,

889
00:51:36.040 --> 00:51:36.371
Korea.

890
00:51:36.371 --> 00:51:41.371
So he knows that to say that this man loves his people is a misrepresentation.

891
00:51:42.310 --> 00:51:47.290
But what do people actually think it I think,
I think it's,
I think it's,

892
00:51:47.860 --> 00:51:51.880
there's another layer beyond that.
No,
he actually doesn't know that.

893
00:51:51.881 --> 00:51:55.810
Like he's so ignorant of what's happening in the world that he's just talking

894
00:51:55.870 --> 00:52:00.550
and there's,
there's no burden on him to represent reality at all.
Or

895
00:52:02.070 --> 00:52:05.340
there's a layer beyond that.
It's simply doesn't matter.
Like,

896
00:52:05.341 --> 00:52:06.960
like the difference between those two things,

897
00:52:06.961 --> 00:52:11.310
lying and bullshitting doesn't matter.
And we're not even going to spend the,
the,

898
00:52:11.311 --> 00:52:15.270
the,
the nanosecond it takes to judge between them.
Uh,

899
00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:18.270
and beyond that,
we're,
uh,

900
00:52:18.540 --> 00:52:21.900
we're not even going to notice that he said anything strange there.
And that's,

901
00:52:22.010 --> 00:52:23.860
that's kind of where most of the country is.

902
00:52:23.861 --> 00:52:28.861
It's like we now have someone in office who will say things that make absolutely

903
00:52:29.371 --> 00:52:30.740
no sense and they,

904
00:52:30.820 --> 00:52:35.820
they are meant to map on the most consequential examples of human suffering in

905
00:52:36.301 --> 00:52:41.040
our time,
right?
And the most consequential risks we run as a civilization.

906
00:52:41.070 --> 00:52:44.340
We're talking about nuclear war here and the conversations that can be had to,

907
00:52:44.390 --> 00:52:45.223
to prevent it.

908
00:52:45.750 --> 00:52:50.750
And he's saying things that are not only just untrue and obscene,

909
00:52:50.851 --> 00:52:54.030
really untrue.
No one's even noticing.

910
00:52:54.150 --> 00:52:57.730
And no one's even noticing that no one's noticing and be like,
so this is like,

911
00:52:57.780 --> 00:52:59.590
I don't even know where we are now,
but it's just like,

912
00:52:59.910 --> 00:53:03.630
I don't think there's a name for this.
Right.
And,
um,

913
00:53:03.720 --> 00:53:04.740
how would I think that matters?

914
00:53:04.741 --> 00:53:07.830
Do you think we have until if what you're saying is right,

915
00:53:08.610 --> 00:53:12.060
how many firewalls left are there before we're really in,
like,

916
00:53:13.080 --> 00:53:17.300
like some true Dystopian,
complete inability to communicate that.

917
00:53:17.310 --> 00:53:18.450
But let me just clarify here is,

918
00:53:18.451 --> 00:53:22.680
I'm not even judging whether anything bad happened in Singapore,
like I,

919
00:53:22.681 --> 00:53:26.490
so it's totally possible that the,
that the evil Chauncey Gardner,

920
00:53:27.300 --> 00:53:28.133
uh,

921
00:53:28.320 --> 00:53:33.320
character could be the thing that successfully gets us to have a better

922
00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:37.310
relationship with,
with North Korea.
So I think that's what's that?

923
00:53:37.730 --> 00:53:40.650
That's possible.
I'm not saying,
I'm not saying I know that's impossible.

924
00:53:41.220 --> 00:53:44.400
It doesn't sound like a great bet to me.
And it doesn't,
it's not the way I would.

925
00:53:44.730 --> 00:53:46.560
It's not,
and even if it's possible,

926
00:53:46.561 --> 00:53:48.720
I don't think it's the best possible strategy.

927
00:53:48.721 --> 00:53:51.600
It'd be better to have someone who actually read the briefing books,

928
00:53:51.601 --> 00:53:55.710
knows the history of negotiations,
knows the possibility that he's being duped.

929
00:53:56.060 --> 00:53:59.250
Um,
it's paying attention to all of that,
even while,
let's say,

930
00:53:59.251 --> 00:54:00.480
playing like the mad man,

931
00:54:00.481 --> 00:54:03.500
if in fact that's the right strategy in this game of chicken.
Uh,

932
00:54:03.620 --> 00:54:05.920
but so there's nothing to optimal about this,
but,

933
00:54:06.070 --> 00:54:08.100
but I'm just saying I'm not clear.
I'm not saying that,

934
00:54:08.280 --> 00:54:13.110
that my worrying about the,
that what's happening,
um,

935
00:54:13.860 --> 00:54:16.050
is not predicated on the claim that Oh,

936
00:54:16.051 --> 00:54:20.010
this whole thing with North Korea is going to be a disaster if it's successful.

937
00:54:20.220 --> 00:54:24.510
That still doesn't answer my primary concern about what we've done to ourselves

938
00:54:24.511 --> 00:54:25.680
in terms of our politics.

939
00:54:25.740 --> 00:54:27.480
<v 1>Yeah.
So how do we negotiate those two things?</v>

940
00:54:27.510 --> 00:54:31.170
Let's just say for a second that despite all the lies and I'm with Ya,

941
00:54:31.190 --> 00:54:33.000
he lies about absolutely everything.
Okay.

942
00:54:33.001 --> 00:54:36.660
Despite all of this craziness and nonsense and all of that,

943
00:54:37.230 --> 00:54:40.410
that basically four years past,
let's say the economy's basically fine,

944
00:54:40.411 --> 00:54:42.710
we don't get into some extra intractable war.

945
00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:45.570
Let's say something good comes out of the North Korea situation.

946
00:54:46.380 --> 00:54:49.200
Basically things have been okay.
You know,

947
00:54:49.201 --> 00:54:51.510
there isn't some massive terror attack or something.

948
00:54:53.270 --> 00:54:58.000
<v 0>I would say we,
we've dodged many,
many bullets and that we got very lucky.</v>

949
00:54:58.150 --> 00:54:58.983
Yeah.

950
00:54:59.800 --> 00:55:04.800
What's impossible to argue is that this is all a brilliant plan that has been

951
00:55:08.501 --> 00:55:11.470
thought through from the beginning on the part of Trump.
I think that's,
I mean,

952
00:55:11.471 --> 00:55:14.470
there's just no evidence for that at all.
Right?
It's not that he is,

953
00:55:14.980 --> 00:55:19.830
he is deeply informed about world history and current events and all of the,

954
00:55:19.960 --> 00:55:22.780
all of the information one would think you would need to know to,

955
00:55:22.860 --> 00:55:27.610
to game this out.
I had some genius level four dimensional chess,
right?
Right.

956
00:55:27.900 --> 00:55:31.930
Uh,
to follow the Scott Adams program.
And uh,

957
00:55:32.290 --> 00:55:33.280
so that's not happening.

958
00:55:33.340 --> 00:55:38.080
So what we could live in a world where having someone who have kind of

959
00:55:38.081 --> 00:55:41.200
fundamentally is just a reality TV show,

960
00:55:41.201 --> 00:55:45.190
star thrust into this position of immense responsibility.

961
00:55:45.191 --> 00:55:49.000
We could live in a world where that can work out in surprising ways,

962
00:55:49.001 --> 00:55:52.720
or at least not cause some kind of disaster.
I hope we live in that world.
I mean,

963
00:55:52.721 --> 00:55:53.410
I'm,
you know,

964
00:55:53.410 --> 00:55:58.300
I hope that he succeeds in every way we would want a president to succeed.
Uh,

965
00:55:58.390 --> 00:56:01.480
and then I also hope he doesn't get reelected.
And I was like,
I,

966
00:56:01.550 --> 00:56:03.870
I think it's still,
it's,

967
00:56:04.030 --> 00:56:07.420
it's obvious to me that we're paying an immense price,

968
00:56:07.870 --> 00:56:10.660
even if terrible things don't happen.
So that happen were

969
00:56:10.700 --> 00:56:12.060
<v 1>terrible.
Things don't happen.</v>

970
00:56:12.070 --> 00:56:15.560
And the left sort of continues with the track that I think we both see it done.

971
00:56:15.830 --> 00:56:18.200
Right.
Could you possibly vote for one of those people?

972
00:56:18.201 --> 00:56:21.310
Like would you feel that this is,
this could override every wall?

973
00:56:21.650 --> 00:56:24.160
It depends who the is and what the,

974
00:56:24.370 --> 00:56:28.080
<v 0>what the tradeoffs are.
Ma,
I think,
you know,
I,
you know,</v>

975
00:56:28.090 --> 00:56:32.320
in my world almost anyone would be better than Trump,

976
00:56:32.560 --> 00:56:37.450
but you know,
give me the,
the sufficiently obnoxious choice on the left.

977
00:56:37.451 --> 00:56:41.070
And you know,
I would,
I could rethink that is,
I think it's,
uh,

978
00:56:41.250 --> 00:56:43.590
<v 1>well I think,
I think you mean rethink that not to vote for Trump,</v>

979
00:56:43.591 --> 00:56:45.600
but you'd end up voting for third party here.

980
00:56:45.770 --> 00:56:48.430
<v 0>Yeah,
I may,
uh,
or that it wouldn't matter.
You know,</v>

981
00:56:48.440 --> 00:56:52.610
we could be in a situation where it's just both sides are so terrible that,

982
00:56:52.640 --> 00:56:56.810
you know,
let's just toss a coin.
Yeah.
But it's just,
it should be,
I mean,
it's,

983
00:56:57.440 --> 00:56:58.310
I don't know how we got here.

984
00:56:58.311 --> 00:57:01.070
We've got more than 300 million people in this country.

985
00:57:01.520 --> 00:57:04.520
There are many really impressive people in this country.

986
00:57:04.670 --> 00:57:09.670
How is it that we can't feel the candidate who has obvious depth of knowledge

987
00:57:13.300 --> 00:57:17.510
are obvious moral compass and you know,
sound goal.

988
00:57:17.550 --> 00:57:21.130
<v 1>Do you think it's just that nobody that was truly good,</v>

989
00:57:21.280 --> 00:57:22.720
that was truly knowledgeable,

990
00:57:22.721 --> 00:57:27.160
that was truly decent and all the things that we'd really want from a president

991
00:57:27.170 --> 00:57:32.170
will never do it now in a time when every one of your texts will be gone through

992
00:57:32.351 --> 00:57:34.540
every year.
Internet search history,

993
00:57:34.541 --> 00:57:39.541
your every little relationship you've ever had that the ability to dig deeper

994
00:57:39.821 --> 00:57:44.530
and dive into more of just the nonsense that no good person who's ever lived a

995
00:57:44.531 --> 00:57:48.520
full life and made mistakes and done drugs or whatever else it is,

996
00:57:48.910 --> 00:57:50.920
would it ever want to do it?

997
00:57:50.921 --> 00:57:55.750
So instead you get sort of this shameless person who has done probably

998
00:57:55.751 --> 00:58:00.670
everything and all sorts of crazy things,
but just doesn't care what you know,

999
00:58:00.671 --> 00:58:05.170
where as a a good decent person who wants to live a decent life and have a

1000
00:58:05.171 --> 00:58:08.080
family and all that.
And I'm not even commenting on it.
Seemed like he,

1001
00:58:08.081 --> 00:58:11.260
his family really loves him.
So I don't mean that,
but that just someone,

1002
00:58:11.350 --> 00:58:14.890
the person that you're looking for in that imaginary equation would never want

1003
00:58:14.891 --> 00:58:16.600
to do it.
That's not someone who would opt in.

1004
00:58:16.750 --> 00:58:20.890
<v 0>Well,
I think there are people who are,
who will opt in,
who are normal.
I just,</v>

1005
00:58:20.891 --> 00:58:25.891
whether or not they will get noticed and get promoted too.

1006
00:58:27.280 --> 00:58:30.250
So like for instance,
I just interviewed a guy who you may not have heard of,

1007
00:58:30.251 --> 00:58:35.020
Andrew Yang who is already declared his candidacy for 2020 as a democrat.

1008
00:58:35.950 --> 00:58:39.970
He's a silicon valley guy.
Uh,
I just recorded a podcast with him.

1009
00:58:39.971 --> 00:58:40.870
I think he'll be the next one.

1010
00:58:40.871 --> 00:58:45.871
I released a very interesting guy whose whole platform it seems is universal

1011
00:58:45.911 --> 00:58:47.160
basic income.
I mean,
he's just,

1012
00:58:47.260 --> 00:58:50.860
he's looking at what's happening in tech and automation and AI and he says,

1013
00:58:51.340 --> 00:58:53.590
you know this in,
as many of us have said,

1014
00:58:53.650 --> 00:58:58.360
or at least worried that that there will be jobs lost in,

1015
00:58:58.370 --> 00:59:02.930
in the near term that aren't coming back and aren't converting to new.
Gee,

1016
00:59:02.940 --> 00:59:04.710
it's not,
it's not like,
you know,

1017
00:59:04.720 --> 00:59:08.440
any analogy you want to draw to previous moments and in economic history,

1018
00:59:08.770 --> 00:59:08.951
you know,

1019
00:59:08.951 --> 00:59:12.220
there will be truck drivers losing jobs and we're not going to retrain those

1020
00:59:12.221 --> 00:59:17.080
truck drivers as software engineers and,
uh,
this is going to be,

1021
00:59:17.410 --> 00:59:19.990
forget about all the other high falutin concerns about Ai.

1022
00:59:19.990 --> 00:59:23.690
This is to be catastrophic if we don't figure out how to deal with it.

1023
00:59:23.691 --> 00:59:27.500
And he thinks ubi as a solution than he,
he,
um,
his book,

1024
00:59:28.500 --> 00:59:32.240
he wrote a book that,
that in very stark terms puts it all in perspective,

1025
00:59:32.241 --> 00:59:35.720
his book as the war on normal people.
Uh,
but I,
I've just,

1026
00:59:35.810 --> 00:59:38.790
I'll have a podcast where that's probably out guys where your next book.
Yeah.

1027
00:59:38.820 --> 00:59:43.820
Yeah.
Normal people,
but he's a,
you know,
he's,
he's very articulate guy.
He's,
he's,

1028
00:59:43.880 --> 00:59:45.680
you know,
thought about these issues deeply,

1029
00:59:45.681 --> 00:59:48.650
whether he's right about ubi being the panacea.

1030
00:59:48.950 --> 00:59:53.130
I think it's certainly open for debate,
but,
um,

1031
00:59:53.660 --> 00:59:56.390
he strikes me as,
I mean,
I don't know him,
I just did one podcast with him,

1032
00:59:56.391 --> 00:59:59.480
but he strikes me as like,
you know,
completely sane,
normal,

1033
00:59:59.560 --> 01:00:04.560
non fame seeking person who just wants to screw up his life by becoming present.

1034
01:00:04.850 --> 01:00:08.510
And because he's worried he's just simply worried about the future his kids are

1035
01:00:08.700 --> 01:00:09.533
going to inherit.

1036
01:00:09.610 --> 01:00:10.181
<v 1>Yeah.
All right,</v>

1037
01:00:10.181 --> 01:00:12.460
so one more on the political stuff that will shift to some other stuff.

1038
01:00:12.461 --> 01:00:15.990
So did you catch,
um,
I know you've been on the show a couple of times.
Uh,

1039
01:00:16.090 --> 01:00:18.760
did you happen to catch a real time on Friday?

1040
01:00:18.761 --> 01:00:23.190
Received the clip of bill basically saying that he's sort of hoping for

1041
01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:25.600
recession because that'll wake people up.

1042
01:00:25.670 --> 01:00:28.540
<v 0>Did,
did you have no,
no.
I asked her if I miss,
I'm a,
I'm a,</v>

1043
01:00:28.541 --> 01:00:30.330
I'm at least a week behind,
but no,
I didn't.

1044
01:00:30.430 --> 01:00:30.731
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1045
01:00:30.731 --> 01:00:35.590
So bill in effect said that if it takes a recession to derail this thing,

1046
01:00:36.180 --> 01:00:40.840
that,
that,
that he'd be for that.
Right.
And you know,

1047
01:00:40.990 --> 01:00:44.380
I like bill a lot.
You know,
I,
I,

1048
01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:46.690
I'd love to have them on the show to discuss some of this stuff.

1049
01:00:46.870 --> 01:00:50.230
But I thought that moment of him saying that a guy who's proud of no idea what

1050
01:00:50.231 --> 01:00:52.990
he's worth,
he's probably worth at least 50 million bucks or something crazy,

1051
01:00:53.620 --> 01:00:56.650
which I don't begrudge him any of that.
Of course,
that's what he said.

1052
01:00:56.651 --> 01:01:00.370
They're so caught me as just this is what people hate about liberals,

1053
01:01:01.250 --> 01:01:03.880
liberals,
whatever the,
you know,
or lefties or whatever it is.

1054
01:01:03.881 --> 01:01:08.070
Like this idea that yeah,
you may not like Trump debate,

1055
01:01:08.380 --> 01:01:11.680
joke about them all the time and all this stuff and you may think he's lying all

1056
01:01:11.681 --> 01:01:15.550
the time,
but that what you would want is a recession,

1057
01:01:15.580 --> 01:01:18.670
which you'll survive cause you've got millions and millions of dollars.

1058
01:01:18.940 --> 01:01:19.830
But it did make the,

1059
01:01:19.900 --> 01:01:22.330
my first thought when I saw it was that right after the election,

1060
01:01:22.331 --> 01:01:27.310
for as much as you despise this man and are so fearful of all of the things that

1061
01:01:27.311 --> 01:01:29.300
he will wrought upon us,
you,

1062
01:01:29.420 --> 01:01:34.420
you made the analogy about the pilot in the plane and I feel like that's the

1063
01:01:34.541 --> 01:01:37.060
right analogy.
And I thought that's what we need right now.

1064
01:01:37.090 --> 01:01:40.930
And I discussed this a little bit with Rogan today and that's where his take was

1065
01:01:40.931 --> 01:01:41.764
also.

1066
01:01:41.930 --> 01:01:44.650
<v 0>Oh,
sorry.
So I haven't seen the clip from bill.</v>

1067
01:01:44.651 --> 01:01:49.651
And so I can imagine at least two charitable interpretations of it that take

1068
01:01:49.781 --> 01:01:50.590
that,

1069
01:01:50.590 --> 01:01:55.590
that a callousness off at one would just be the idea that we're running such an

1070
01:01:56.471 --> 01:01:58.810
intolerable risk with this guy at the helm.

1071
01:01:59.490 --> 01:02:03.880
And the only way he's going to be voted out is to have something like a

1072
01:02:03.881 --> 01:02:06.540
recession.
So there definitely was an element of that,
right?
So like,

1073
01:02:06.541 --> 01:02:07.600
and it's like,
so this is,

1074
01:02:07.601 --> 01:02:10.090
we're running every day you wake up and don't think about it.

1075
01:02:10.091 --> 01:02:13.450
You're running the risk of nuclear catastrophe with this guy that's,
you know,

1076
01:02:13.510 --> 01:02:18.430
50% more than it should be or that would otherwise be.
Uh,
and that the,

1077
01:02:18.490 --> 01:02:20.430
the price of that,
again,
a price,

1078
01:02:20.431 --> 01:02:23.580
you're not aware of pain because we're just talking about hypotheticals,
right?

1079
01:02:23.581 --> 01:02:28.230
It's just risk,
increased risk.
Uh,
it's worth doing this.

1080
01:02:28.380 --> 01:02:32.220
Some other,
you know,
catastrophic,
uh,
change.

1081
01:02:32.610 --> 01:02:35.760
If it's the thing that's gonna get us a new president.
And,
and so I mean that,

1082
01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:39.450
yeah,
that would be defensible if you actually thought that that was in fact the

1083
01:02:39.451 --> 01:02:43.860
situation we're in.
Um,
but you know,
I don't know what he was actually thinking.

1084
01:02:44.070 --> 01:02:44.530
Yeah.

1085
01:02:44.530 --> 01:02:47.740
<v 1>Um,
isn't it nice that you give the charitable interpretation?</v>

1086
01:02:47.741 --> 01:02:48.850
You don't want to just do what you were

1087
01:02:48.950 --> 01:02:51.710
<v 0>certainly,
certainly not surprising in this case because he's a friend,</v>

1088
01:02:51.711 --> 01:02:54.110
but it's a,
I would,
you know,

1089
01:02:54.111 --> 01:02:58.040
I try to do that even when I'm thinking about it.
I mean,
truth is,

1090
01:02:58.041 --> 01:03:01.840
I do that with Trump.
Like I've been a thing that I find someone tolerable.
Yeah.

1091
01:03:01.910 --> 01:03:06.910
About the left is also exemplified in how they attack Trump for things that he's

1092
01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:09.290
not guilty of.
Clearly.
I mean,

1093
01:03:09.650 --> 01:03:14.570
there's no one who despises this man more than me.
I'm out.

1094
01:03:14.571 --> 01:03:17.900
I mean it's,
yeah.
I don't know how you compare these things,
but like,
yeah,
I will,

1095
01:03:17.901 --> 01:03:22.610
I'll go to the mat with anyone [inaudible] to destroy later.
I mean,
I can,

1096
01:03:22.670 --> 01:03:26.790
I can,
I can talk endlessly about what's wrong with this guy.
Yeah.

1097
01:03:27.080 --> 01:03:30.710
But when people,
when people on the left or did not,
I mean,
I'm not,

1098
01:03:30.711 --> 01:03:33.290
I don't mean just fringe left.
I mean the New York Times,
yeah.

1099
01:03:33.320 --> 01:03:38.100
Go after him for things that seem clearly just calculated to mislead.

1100
01:03:38.210 --> 01:03:41.360
I mean,
they're just disingenuous.
Um,
it's,

1101
01:03:42.140 --> 01:03:47.120
it's just a bit,
I get as annoyed by that as by anything.
So I mean,
I'm,
I'm,

1102
01:03:47.270 --> 01:03:49.190
I'm PR within my own mind.

1103
01:03:49.191 --> 01:03:53.240
I feel pretty balanced in how careful I am,
you know?
So like for,

1104
01:03:53.241 --> 01:03:57.350
I mean to take the,
um,
like the ms 13 thing.
I mean,

1105
01:03:57.351 --> 01:04:01.340
have you seen what's going on with ms 13 on Long Island?
Did you,

1106
01:04:01.370 --> 01:04:04.330
did you watch that front line?
Uh,
I didn't see the front line.
Okay.
But,
you know,

1107
01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:05.750
it's like going on.
I mean,

1108
01:04:05.751 --> 01:04:10.751
so it's the fact that anyone is minimizing the significance of how horrible this

1109
01:04:12.081 --> 01:04:13.640
is.
Yeah.
Right.
It's just,

1110
01:04:14.190 --> 01:04:17.030
and playing politics with that and catching him saying like,
you know,

1111
01:04:17.031 --> 01:04:18.320
these people are animals.
Right.

1112
01:04:18.321 --> 01:04:22.070
And then do you using that to mean that he thinks everyone coming from Latin

1113
01:04:22.071 --> 01:04:26.990
America as an animal?
Um,
it's,
uh,
I mean that's,

1114
01:04:27.020 --> 01:04:28.520
it's just so toxic.

1115
01:04:28.660 --> 01:04:32.010
<v 1>Here's w I view that as different somehow than,
all right,</v>

1116
01:04:32.011 --> 01:04:35.430
forget the buzz feeds in salons and that whole set that we already talked about,

1117
01:04:35.431 --> 01:04:40.431
but this thing now with the New York Times and CNN where they're doing this now.

1118
01:04:40.980 --> 01:04:44.010
Yeah.
That to me is something that is truly,

1119
01:04:44.011 --> 01:04:49.011
systemically that's different and that's extremely dangerous.

1120
01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:52.770
Like what could possibly be happening there at,
uh,

1121
01:04:53.790 --> 01:04:57.540
at a sort of systemic level that makes sense that they can get away with this

1122
01:04:57.541 --> 01:05:01.440
stuff?
Well,
no,
they know five minutes later it's going to be exposed.

1123
01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:04.390
<v 0>Well,
I don't know if I know that,
but yeah,</v>

1124
01:05:04.391 --> 01:05:09.090
but I think the fact that you see it that way is a measure of

1125
01:05:11.250 --> 01:05:16.250
how important a reality based conversation is and how different the expectation

1126
01:05:16.741 --> 01:05:20.450
is of something like the New York Times versus something like Breitbart.
Right,

1127
01:05:20.480 --> 01:05:23.590
right.
So like,
it matters that the New York Times gets it wrong.

1128
01:05:23.620 --> 01:05:28.280
It matters that the New York Times is it all click baity.
Right.
And so,

1129
01:05:28.281 --> 01:05:31.570
and then when you compare that to something like Breitbart,
you know,
it's just,

1130
01:05:32.590 --> 01:05:37.450
there's a fundamentally different expectation.
And so,
um,
we'll that's people,

1131
01:05:37.451 --> 01:05:38.520
people give me shit all the time.
Little,

1132
01:05:38.530 --> 01:05:40.300
I'm always attacking New York Times and CNN.

1133
01:05:40.301 --> 01:05:42.950
It's like those are the ones I think mattered.
Yeah,
no,
it does.

1134
01:05:43.220 --> 01:05:46.780
You want me to tackle the ones everyone else's attacking or that I don't expect

1135
01:05:46.990 --> 01:05:50.910
to do real journalism.
They're just.com.
That's all they are.
Yeah.

1136
01:05:50.980 --> 01:05:51.620
But I mean it matters.

1137
01:05:51.620 --> 01:05:54.430
It matters across the board because people are confused by those people think

1138
01:05:54.431 --> 01:05:57.690
that vox is like the New York time.
Right.
And,

1139
01:05:57.691 --> 01:06:01.810
and it's confusing because you can find articles on box that are fantastic.

1140
01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:05.930
I mean,
it's just,
there's a,
there's a real,
um,

1141
01:06:06.670 --> 01:06:11.200
range of quality you get everywhere now and,
um,

1142
01:06:12.370 --> 01:06:16.270
and you,
there shouldn't be a wide range in something like the New York Times.

1143
01:06:16.300 --> 01:06:19.090
Right.
And,
and,
and it's,
and we're seeing this,
you know,

1144
01:06:19.091 --> 01:06:24.040
like as any of us get close to being part of the news story,
right?

1145
01:06:24.070 --> 01:06:27.310
Whether it's a directly on you or it's told about one of your friends.

1146
01:06:27.311 --> 01:06:30.790
It's like New York Times.
I mean,
someone I know at the New York Times,

1147
01:06:30.980 --> 01:06:32.830
Bret Stephens who,

1148
01:06:33.160 --> 01:06:35.740
who moved from the Wall Street Journal and now he's an opinion writer in New

1149
01:06:35.740 --> 01:06:39.130
York Times.
I know the piece he just went after Ilan for,
I mean,

1150
01:06:39.131 --> 01:06:43.660
it was just a pure clickbait hit piece that was just,
it was just,

1151
01:06:43.810 --> 01:06:46.900
you know,
Breitbart level trash.
Right.
I mean,
it was,

1152
01:06:46.901 --> 01:06:51.900
it was wrong in every respect.
Um,
apart from the fact that it,

1153
01:06:52.210 --> 01:06:56.980
that it summarized some of the economic skepticism about Tesla,

1154
01:06:57.010 --> 01:06:59.740
but I mean he's,
you know,
wasn't really the issue.
No,

1155
01:06:59.741 --> 01:07:04.390
it may because he basically said that Ilan is silicon valley's Trump.
Right.

1156
01:07:04.391 --> 01:07:07.930
And a con man.
And it's just,
just know he's got this.
No,
they're there.

1157
01:07:08.170 --> 01:07:11.800
He's lying about everything.
Um,
I mean,
if,

1158
01:07:11.890 --> 01:07:15.820
if ever there were a person you can't say is,

1159
01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:20.140
is without substance and is just a pure con man,
it's Ilan.
I mean like,

1160
01:07:20.141 --> 01:07:21.510
it's like he,

1161
01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:26.470
he could fail to do half the things he's promising to do and he does more than

1162
01:07:26.471 --> 01:07:29.880
the next product,
most productive hundred people.
I mean,
it's just,
it's,
it's,

1163
01:07:29.881 --> 01:07:34.660
it's insane.
So,
and I,
you know,
uh,
it was,
it was hilarious because I,

1164
01:07:34.820 --> 01:07:38.920
this all was time with my getting off Twitter,
as I said,
by like 95%,

1165
01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:43.570
but I was on long enough to notice this and,
and,
and just take a shot at,
at,
uh,

1166
01:07:43.690 --> 01:07:48.310
Brett in,
uh,
you know,
in response,
um,
because it was intolerable to me,

1167
01:07:48.340 --> 01:07:52.060
but the New York Times somewhat respectful way,
right?
Yeah.

1168
01:07:52.061 --> 01:07:54.070
And then you didn't do it the way that most people do,

1169
01:07:54.071 --> 01:07:59.050
which was just like blurted out a snow.
No.
Would I let him know?

1170
01:07:59.051 --> 01:08:03.430
But cause I was,
I'm a fan of breads.
I publicly celebrated also on Twitter,

1171
01:08:03.610 --> 01:08:07.390
his move to the New York Times.
It's like I congratulated him and you know,

1172
01:08:07.391 --> 01:08:11.660
I think he's a,
he's a very smart guy,
you know,
for whatever re,
you know,

1173
01:08:11.710 --> 01:08:16.550
dogmatic reason.
He was sort of destined to get this,
this wrong,

1174
01:08:16.580 --> 01:08:20.990
but he's so totally wrong that it is just,
is a real consequence.

1175
01:08:20.991 --> 01:08:25.040
The New York Times can't afford to be this wrong about,
in this case,
you know,

1176
01:08:25.041 --> 01:08:29.450
the prospects of a company like Tesla and a cleantech and you know,

1177
01:08:29.570 --> 01:08:31.010
I mean it's just,
it was a,

1178
01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:32.833
<v 3>mmm.</v>

1179
01:08:33.710 --> 01:08:35.950
<v 0>All of this connects obviously with climate change and,
you know,</v>

1180
01:08:36.110 --> 01:08:40.900
huge important issues.
And I think that one for,
I don't know Brett personally,

1181
01:08:40.901 --> 01:08:42.220
but it seems like what,

1182
01:08:42.760 --> 01:08:45.490
what this was all about was because Alanna was attacking the media because he

1183
01:08:45.491 --> 01:08:48.970
was unhappy about the way some stuff was reported and then Brett was obviously

1184
01:08:48.971 --> 01:08:52.330
being defensive over the media.
Yeah.
Um,

1185
01:08:52.660 --> 01:08:56.560
but I was very pleased watching the lines thread on this because I was like,

1186
01:08:56.561 --> 01:09:00.100
yeah,
we need more people to be attacking this,
you know,

1187
01:09:00.101 --> 01:09:04.210
otherwise the times won't turn around.
Yeah.
You know,

1188
01:09:04.440 --> 01:09:05.920
I don't know whether he's doing himself,

1189
01:09:07.060 --> 01:09:07.893
<v 3>uh,</v>

1190
01:09:08.950 --> 01:09:11.080
<v 0>harm by engaging in that way.
I mean,</v>

1191
01:09:11.300 --> 01:09:15.010
he could be just something that happens to somebody once they crossed,
you know,

1192
01:09:15.011 --> 01:09:17.710
the,
the 20 million mark on Twitter a cycle like,
or you just get those,

1193
01:09:17.830 --> 01:09:20.730
you become like Trump in that respect and you just decide to,
you know,

1194
01:09:20.731 --> 01:09:25.060
use Twitter that way.
But,
uh,
it's,
I mean,

1195
01:09:25.061 --> 01:09:27.960
on one level it's refreshing that you have someone that you have a CEO who's

1196
01:09:27.970 --> 01:09:30.490
kind of this transparent with what he's thinking and this,

1197
01:09:30.491 --> 01:09:33.280
and just engaging on all of these issues with,
with,
you know,

1198
01:09:33.281 --> 01:09:37.830
people in his ad mentions.
But,
um,
it's,

1199
01:09:39.280 --> 01:09:43.300
I dunno,
I thought,
you know,
I think it's,
again,
I think,
I think social media,

1200
01:09:43.510 --> 01:09:48.510
the net result for virtually everyone is you're lucky to get back to zero.

1201
01:09:48.910 --> 01:09:50.860
You know,
like that if you,

1202
01:09:50.890 --> 01:09:55.000
if you're going to take an inventory of what was gained in the end by all of

1203
01:09:55.001 --> 01:09:56.870
this,
all of the energy you've,

1204
01:09:56.871 --> 01:10:00.560
you've spent fighting with people or correcting the record,
it's,
you're,

1205
01:10:00.700 --> 01:10:03.110
you're lucky to have gotten it.

1206
01:10:03.350 --> 01:10:06.540
You can check all the time that you've owned someone versus,
you know,

1207
01:10:06.550 --> 01:10:08.510
all the times they owned you.
And all right.
So let,

1208
01:10:08.511 --> 01:10:10.240
let's put all of that aside for a second.

1209
01:10:10.630 --> 01:10:13.720
I do want to do a sort of deep dive on the,
on the Jordan stuff.

1210
01:10:13.721 --> 01:10:16.950
Cause I think maybe we can set the table in a nice way for your conversations,

1211
01:10:17.290 --> 01:10:22.290
but what's on your mind more than anything else right now that's not political

1212
01:10:22.750 --> 01:10:25.960
or not unrelated to the conversation with Jordan?
Or like what,

1213
01:10:25.970 --> 01:10:29.820
what are you really thinking about right now?
Well,

1214
01:10:29.821 --> 01:10:33.270
I'm thinking more about the kind of core things that interest me.

1215
01:10:33.271 --> 01:10:35.700
Like the nature of consciousness,
you know,
and,

1216
01:10:35.850 --> 01:10:40.850
and just how to live a good life given the fact that we wake up every day not

1217
01:10:42.781 --> 01:10:47.190
knowing how long we've got and we're absolutely sure that we don't get this day

1218
01:10:47.191 --> 01:10:48.690
again.
You know,
so it's just like how to,

1219
01:10:49.170 --> 01:10:53.570
how to meaningfully engage moment to moment in our lives in a way that's

1220
01:10:53.580 --> 01:10:56.610
rewarding and,
and,
uh,

1221
01:10:56.760 --> 01:11:01.470
minimizes unnecessary suffering and increases joy and,

1222
01:11:01.530 --> 01:11:06.240
and insight and creativity.
And,
and so for me,

1223
01:11:06.330 --> 01:11:10.950
as you know,
meditation is part of that certainly.
And,
uh,

1224
01:11:11.010 --> 01:11:11.401
I've just,

1225
01:11:11.401 --> 01:11:16.401
I've just come out with meditation APP that is now in Beta in on apple and the

1226
01:11:18.570 --> 01:11:20.190
Android Beta LP.
It's probably about a month away.

1227
01:11:20.460 --> 01:11:24.630
This has been taken completely mystifying to me that it's taken me this long to

1228
01:11:24.631 --> 01:11:27.120
build an app and talk about something you doing over there.

1229
01:11:27.130 --> 01:11:30.130
You didn't understand.
Um,
but I mean really,

1230
01:11:30.170 --> 01:11:35.170
it literally is just a glorified MP three player and he was taken me longer than

1231
01:11:35.191 --> 01:11:39.560
two years and just vast expense to build this thing.
Uh,

1232
01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:44.460
but in any case,
I'm,
I'm happy with the,
um,
theater ration that's coming out now.

1233
01:11:44.461 --> 01:11:47.320
And so that's,
I'm going to,
it's not just a meditation APP,

1234
01:11:47.321 --> 01:11:51.680
but it will have my podcast and other content I put on it.
But,
uh,

1235
01:11:51.780 --> 01:11:53.400
I'm thinking my,

1236
01:11:53.401 --> 01:11:57.930
my withdrawal from the toxicity of social media and,

1237
01:11:58.500 --> 01:12:03.500
and the political conversations has led me to just clear,

1238
01:12:04.890 --> 01:12:09.610
uh,
a lot more space frankly for four things that I think are,
are,

1239
01:12:09.910 --> 01:12:11.970
uh,
interesting and,

1240
01:12:11.971 --> 01:12:16.920
and profound in a durable way that where you're not going to look back five

1241
01:12:16.921 --> 01:12:21.921
years from now or 20 years from now and wonder why you spent your time on those

1242
01:12:23.521 --> 01:12:28.050
things.
And so much of,
of all of our lives,
but you know,
like my,

1243
01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:33.080
my life and my public life in particular has been spent on things where when I

1244
01:12:34.291 --> 01:12:35.420
look back at it,

1245
01:12:35.510 --> 01:12:38.910
it just looks like one opportunity cause after another and be like virtually

1246
01:12:38.911 --> 01:12:41.490
everything that I,

1247
01:12:41.670 --> 01:12:45.660
I'm well known for talking about has been a waste of time.

1248
01:12:46.030 --> 01:12:50.070
And that's,
it's,
it's in some sense of necessary.

1249
01:12:50.190 --> 01:12:52.890
It's not that I've squandered my time in a way that I didn't think was
necessary,

1250
01:12:52.891 --> 01:12:53.724
but

1251
01:12:54.220 --> 01:12:56.210
<v 1>it woke up a lot of people along the way.</v>

1252
01:12:57.250 --> 01:13:01.210
<v 0>Hence,
hence I felt it was necessary,
but it was an opportunity cost.
It's like,</v>

1253
01:13:01.211 --> 01:13:03.790
it's like it's,
it's,
it's in some level a on some of it,

1254
01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:08.800
it's trying to get to zero is like can we get to the starting point where we

1255
01:13:08.891 --> 01:13:12.820
then can advance the conversation pass what we should had every reason to

1256
01:13:12.821 --> 01:13:14.350
already understand to be true.

1257
01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:17.120
<v 1>So I think a lot of people are lining up behind that.
And again,</v>

1258
01:13:17.150 --> 01:13:20.000
it still gets to where I think this thing is fertile right now.

1259
01:13:20.030 --> 01:13:23.930
I do think there has been some sort of shift.

1260
01:13:24.140 --> 01:13:28.050
I can see it when I'm with the Peterson audiences,
I can see it just,

1261
01:13:28.100 --> 01:13:31.820
there's a new conversation happening that people are starting to arm themselves

1262
01:13:31.821 --> 01:13:35.990
with.
Like how do we move forward through this craziness,

1263
01:13:35.991 --> 01:13:40.991
whether we all agree on belief or lack of belief or religion or some of that

1264
01:13:41.211 --> 01:13:43.670
other,
some of that other stuff.
Um,

1265
01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:45.050
<v 0>Yup.</v>

1266
01:13:45.050 --> 01:13:46.910
<v 1>You know,
one of the things that you told me the first time we met,</v>

1267
01:13:46.911 --> 01:13:51.140
which now it was the first time you did my shows,
September 9th,

1268
01:13:51.140 --> 01:13:54.800
2015 it seems like 87 lifetimes ago that that was the first show.
The first show.

1269
01:13:54.830 --> 01:13:56.350
Yeah.
That was at our TV way back.

1270
01:13:56.360 --> 01:13:58.940
Right in which the whole purpose of having you on the show was to clean up so

1271
01:13:58.941 --> 01:13:59.774
much of the mess.

1272
01:13:59.990 --> 01:14:04.190
And I think we did a pretty decent job but at the same time because of all this,

1273
01:14:04.230 --> 01:14:06.530
you know the people that want to drag you just keep dragging you.

1274
01:14:06.770 --> 01:14:08.090
But one of the most interesting things,

1275
01:14:08.091 --> 01:14:11.240
and I know you don't believe in Karma in a,
in any kind of traditional,

1276
01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:15.250
but that you were on real time to talk about waking up,

1277
01:14:15.251 --> 01:14:19.840
talking to him about the book tour that was about a guy does spirituality

1278
01:14:19.841 --> 01:14:24.340
without religion.
Thus your book tour got ransacked by that.

1279
01:14:24.730 --> 01:14:29.710
So it's like Eh,
in Karma,
but it's kind of an,
it's just like Whoa,

1280
01:14:29.770 --> 01:14:31.210
that's something pretty profound.

1281
01:14:31.320 --> 01:14:35.880
<v 0>I've actually never thought about what my life would've been like without social</v>

1282
01:14:35.881 --> 01:14:37.380
media at that point.

1283
01:14:37.381 --> 01:14:40.640
Like I like the cause cause the consequence in my life of the of that,
you know,

1284
01:14:40.650 --> 01:14:45.650
fight with Ben Affleck on real time was basically a year spent digging out from

1285
01:14:49.020 --> 01:14:53.880
that charge.
I was like,
okay so your,
your views about Islam are racist.

1286
01:14:54.040 --> 01:14:58.480
<v 1>Like anyone ever called you racist before that or bigoted or anyone of any</v>

1287
01:14:58.481 --> 01:15:00.190
consequences?
Like was there anything,

1288
01:15:01.400 --> 01:15:05.530
<v 0>well,
I mean I'm sure,
I'm sure,
but I don't,
I don't remember it being something I,</v>

1289
01:15:05.590 --> 01:15:09.620
that I had to respond to.
Yeah,
I think and,
but it was just that was so

1290
01:15:11.150 --> 01:15:14.690
captivating to people and there was so much,
so much spun out after that.

1291
01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:20.120
But again,
had I not been on social media,
it might have in my world,

1292
01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:22.510
it might've blown over and in two weeks.
Right.

1293
01:15:23.240 --> 01:15:26.780
I might've not felt there was anything to respond to.
And a,

1294
01:15:26.781 --> 01:15:31.340
I could have just moved on directly to talking about meditation and a rational

1295
01:15:31.670 --> 01:15:34.940
take on spirituality and um,
I don't know.

1296
01:15:34.970 --> 01:15:38.030
But it's certainly possible if that's the case.
So.

1297
01:15:39.300 --> 01:15:40.720
<v 1>All right,
so meditation,</v>

1298
01:15:40.810 --> 01:15:45.160
what do you think is the right amount then of spirituality for the amount of

1299
01:15:45.161 --> 01:15:46.360
people that are watching this,

1300
01:15:46.710 --> 01:15:50.650
that maybe you were on the fence about religion or,
or actually are,
are atheists,

1301
01:15:50.651 --> 01:15:54.400
but that are trying to figure out some spiritual sense of going forward and

1302
01:15:54.401 --> 01:15:57.460
cleaning out some of the clutter that we're inundated with.

1303
01:15:58.540 --> 01:16:00.880
What do you think is sort of the easiest way to enter that,

1304
01:16:01.150 --> 01:16:05.890
<v 0>that world?
Well,
I'm sure this is something Jordan and I are going to get,</v>

1305
01:16:06.060 --> 01:16:07.870
uh,
we're going to butt heads over.

1306
01:16:07.871 --> 01:16:12.871
But it would be the level at which people have been primed to think about

1307
01:16:13.780 --> 01:16:18.780
meaning and profundity and all and the sacred and spirituality by traditional

1308
01:16:19.691 --> 01:16:23.620
religions,
especially Abrahamic religion is,

1309
01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:27.760
uh,
certainly not necessary.
And I,
you know,

1310
01:16:27.761 --> 01:16:32.761
I would argue it's not at all useful when you talk about what the,

1311
01:16:33.291 --> 01:16:37.030
the opportunity actually is and what's what's available to you as like,

1312
01:16:37.031 --> 01:16:40.000
as a conscious agent in this moment.
Um,

1313
01:16:41.170 --> 01:16:46.170
and it's not an accident that people are going to the east and to the east,

1314
01:16:46.660 --> 01:16:51.660
the eastern tradition for insight with respect to this particular variable of

1315
01:16:52.571 --> 01:16:55.630
just,
just how to pay attention to experience closely enough.

1316
01:16:55.990 --> 01:16:58.960
So it was to notice something worth noticing in the West.

1317
01:16:58.961 --> 01:17:03.820
People have been praying to Yahweh for 2000 years to do that.
Right?

1318
01:17:03.850 --> 01:17:08.320
And it's,
it's,
it's explicitly dualistic.
It's explicitly,

1319
01:17:08.840 --> 01:17:13.490
uh,
uh,
hostage to this notion of revelation,

1320
01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:17.480
the notion of a God with whom you're in relationship,
who can,

1321
01:17:17.810 --> 01:17:22.250
who can be propitiated with prayer or not.
It's just,

1322
01:17:22.251 --> 01:17:25.190
it's hooked to all of the mythologizing that,

1323
01:17:25.220 --> 01:17:28.520
that Jordan is so enamored of.
Uh,

1324
01:17:28.850 --> 01:17:33.350
and in my world it's totally unnecessary and totally all of that's confusing.

1325
01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:36.210
It's like,
it's needlessly confusing,
right?
Um,

1326
01:17:36.410 --> 01:17:41.410
and it would be just as confusing to go to Tibetan Buddhism and acquire all the

1327
01:17:41.691 --> 01:17:46.270
religiosity of,
of the Tibetans or to go to,
you know,

1328
01:17:47.180 --> 01:17:51.020
the Indian tradition and take on all of the,
the,

1329
01:17:51.140 --> 01:17:55.610
the ordinary forms of Hinduism,
you know,
the,
the exoteric,
you know,
non,

1330
01:17:56.300 --> 01:17:58.880
uh,
that the dualistic forms of Hinduism.
So you're like,
you know,

1331
01:17:59.270 --> 01:18:03.590
just how much time should we spend thinking about the monkey God,
Hanuman,
or,

1332
01:18:03.591 --> 01:18:06.440
you know,
Ganache the elephant headed Ganash and it,
did she have a really,

1333
01:18:06.470 --> 01:18:09.320
you know,
terrorist head off and put an elephant head on there.
And it's like,

1334
01:18:09.500 --> 01:18:09.981
do we,

1335
01:18:09.981 --> 01:18:14.390
it's like these books you could run the same game that Jordan is doing with

1336
01:18:14.391 --> 01:18:17.210
Judeo the Judeo Christian tradition with Hinduism.

1337
01:18:17.780 --> 01:18:19.370
And think that somehow all of that,

1338
01:18:19.371 --> 01:18:22.910
all of that mythmaking and story telling is necessary.

1339
01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:24.650
I'm not saying there's no,

1340
01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:28.280
I'm not saying you can't find people who have some good results in their lives

1341
01:18:28.281 --> 01:18:32.350
by thinking of,
you know,
thinking they're in relationship to Honamin every day.

1342
01:18:33.130 --> 01:18:35.270
Uh,
but there's,

1343
01:18:35.300 --> 01:18:40.300
there's something truly universal and not at all bound by culture and not at all

1344
01:18:41.481 --> 01:18:44.270
bound by history about the nature of consciousness.

1345
01:18:44.300 --> 01:18:46.280
And that can be realized directly.
And that,

1346
01:18:46.281 --> 01:18:49.640
and meditation is simply a tool for doing that.
And it just,

1347
01:18:49.670 --> 01:18:53.700
it is just an accident and an explainable accident,
but it's an,

1348
01:18:53.701 --> 01:18:58.701
it's an accident of history that there are certain traditions that got the point

1349
01:18:59.270 --> 01:19:04.250
very early in an an in a way that's uncontaminated by needless concepts.

1350
01:19:04.730 --> 01:19:08.720
Uh,
and certain traditions don't have it at all.
And,
and Buddhism is,

1351
01:19:08.721 --> 01:19:13.550
is unique in that you can find a strand in it that really is not,

1352
01:19:14.090 --> 01:19:15.260
it's not even a religion.

1353
01:19:15.380 --> 01:19:18.680
It is just simply a methodology for paying attention to the nature of

1354
01:19:18.681 --> 01:19:23.600
consciousness.
And you can,
and you need not take on any Buddhism,
you know,

1355
01:19:23.630 --> 01:19:27.110
even as a philosophy in order to do that.
And so,
you know,
you know,

1356
01:19:27.130 --> 01:19:31.250
[inaudible] you know,
my book waking up and,
and whenever I talk about this,

1357
01:19:31.850 --> 01:19:35.390
uh,
yeah,
I try to boil it down to here somewhere if you want to reference it.

1358
01:19:36.740 --> 01:19:38.990
And I still remember what I think on that regard.

1359
01:19:40.130 --> 01:19:42.200
But yeah,
you can,

1360
01:19:42.201 --> 01:19:47.201
you can get to the heart of the matter without presupposing any religious

1361
01:19:47.780 --> 01:19:52.190
nonsense.
And the heart of the matter is that,
you know,
consciousness again,

1362
01:19:52.191 --> 01:19:55.460
as I said,
is the one thing in this universe that can't be an illusion.
I mean,

1363
01:19:55.461 --> 01:19:57.500
what's,
so whatever we are,
whatever,
however,

1364
01:19:57.501 --> 01:20:02.270
consciousness is integrated with physical reality,
that's still a question mark.

1365
01:20:04.220 --> 01:20:08.240
Whether we're being run on the,
you know,
the,
uh,
supercomputer in some,
you know,

1366
01:20:08.250 --> 01:20:11.700
future state of humanity and we're just a simulation or whether,
you know,

1367
01:20:11.701 --> 01:20:15.430
whether we're,
you know,
have been invented by aliens,
this,

1368
01:20:15.470 --> 01:20:18.870
this universe can be strained in ways that we can't even imagine.

1369
01:20:20.130 --> 01:20:21.600
Still.
There's,
there's this,

1370
01:20:21.660 --> 01:20:24.120
there's this moment where something seems to be happening.

1371
01:20:24.300 --> 01:20:27.090
There's something that is like to be you,
whatever you are,
right?

1372
01:20:27.240 --> 01:20:31.020
Whatever the physics of things this second.
Yes.
That is the,

1373
01:20:31.021 --> 01:20:35.040
that is the fact of consciousness,
that that is what we mean by consciousness.

1374
01:20:35.041 --> 01:20:38.700
I mean this,
it's possible to define consciousness in other ways,
but those,
those,

1375
01:20:38.820 --> 01:20:40.740
those definitions are,
are,
are confusing.

1376
01:20:40.770 --> 01:20:45.060
Do you think Jordan disagrees with that point because when we haven't talked

1377
01:20:45.061 --> 01:20:46.080
about it but no,
I would doubt.

1378
01:20:46.740 --> 01:20:49.470
I don't think you can coherently disagree with that and it's like this is,

1379
01:20:49.471 --> 01:20:51.690
this is,
this could be a dream,
right?

1380
01:20:51.691 --> 01:20:54.060
You could be asleep and dreaming and we're not even doing this podcast,

1381
01:20:54.061 --> 01:20:58.980
but still the fact that it seems like something at this moment to be you,

1382
01:20:59.850 --> 01:21:02.790
that is what that is what we mean by consciousness and

1383
01:21:04.480 --> 01:21:09.480
it is just a fact that you can pay attention to that circumstance carefully

1384
01:21:10.201 --> 01:21:15.201
enough to discover certain things that are profound and surprising and do

1385
01:21:17.281 --> 01:21:22.140
actually link up with the phenomenology of religion.
Let me do,
I mean,

1386
01:21:22.180 --> 01:21:23.670
so hell,

1387
01:21:23.671 --> 01:21:28.230
at least some of what Jesus said about what it's like to be Jesus is,

1388
01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:32.370
is discoverable as a property of your own consciousness now.

1389
01:21:32.730 --> 01:21:34.380
And you don't have to be a Christian to do that.

1390
01:21:34.410 --> 01:21:37.010
And so it is with Buddha or any other,
you know,
any uh,

1391
01:21:37.030 --> 01:21:40.380
other matriarch or patriarch of,
of the world's religious traditions.

1392
01:21:40.740 --> 01:21:42.870
And you don't need these,

1393
01:21:42.960 --> 01:21:47.960
these additional cultural artifacts that clearly are the product of the fact

1394
01:21:48.991 --> 01:21:49.350
that,

1395
01:21:49.350 --> 01:21:52.290
that people were isolated from one another and speaking different languages and

1396
01:21:52.291 --> 01:21:56.970
never corresponding about their claims.
Um,

1397
01:21:57.840 --> 01:22:00.960
there's just,
there is a deeper universal culture,

1398
01:22:00.961 --> 01:22:05.910
free reality which we are subjectively and that that is consciousness and,

1399
01:22:05.911 --> 01:22:07.380
and its contents in each moment.

1400
01:22:07.410 --> 01:22:12.410
And one thing you can realize about consciousness is that the self you take

1401
01:22:12.871 --> 01:22:14.520
yourself to be in each moment,

1402
01:22:14.550 --> 01:22:19.550
that the feeling that you're riding around in your head as the unchanging center

1403
01:22:19.950 --> 01:22:24.150
of your life,
that's an illusion.
And you can discover that to be an illusion.

1404
01:22:24.151 --> 01:22:28.260
You can,
you can lose that feeling of being a,

1405
01:22:28.800 --> 01:22:32.670
an occupant of your body,
like not being identical to your body.

1406
01:22:33.060 --> 01:22:38.000
But being sort of just behind your face as a subject who's appropriating

1407
01:22:38.020 --> 01:22:42.540
experience in each moment and who's,
you know,
in addition to thoughts arising,

1408
01:22:43.110 --> 01:22:45.860
it's felt that there's a thinker of the thoughts,
right?

1409
01:22:46.230 --> 01:22:50.790
That's an illusion that can be cut through.
And when you do cut through it,

1410
01:22:51.660 --> 01:22:54.900
your experience changes in ways that,
that again,

1411
01:22:54.901 --> 01:22:57.460
link up with some of the ideals of,
you know,

1412
01:22:57.510 --> 01:23:01.680
traditional contemplative and spiritual and mystical,
uh,

1413
01:23:02.990 --> 01:23:07.160
uh,
claims.
But again,
you can do that.

1414
01:23:07.380 --> 01:23:11.800
We can have a 21st century's science-based conversation about that.
And that's,

1415
01:23:12.210 --> 01:23:14.950
that's what I think is worth paying attention to.
All right.

1416
01:23:14.951 --> 01:23:18.240
So before we dive into some of the specifics with Jordan,
do you have,

1417
01:23:18.280 --> 01:23:21.940
do you ever get shit from the atheist community for even going this far into

1418
01:23:21.941 --> 01:23:26.930
spirituality?
Is that,
is that a common thing?
Cause that,

1419
01:23:26.931 --> 01:23:30.910
that world of it,
I think I've completely missed.
If so.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No,
I mean,

1420
01:23:30.911 --> 01:23:35.710
I've often joked about the fact that the talk I gave at the,
uh,

1421
01:23:35.711 --> 01:23:38.110
the atheist alliance conference in,

1422
01:23:38.640 --> 01:23:42.970
I think it was 2007 was the only talk I'm aware of that ever started with a

1423
01:23:42.971 --> 01:23:46.960
standing ovation.
And it was booze and people leaving.
And it was this,

1424
01:23:47.470 --> 01:23:51.040
I made two points there that,
that people found indigestible.
One,
as I said,

1425
01:23:51.250 --> 01:23:54.730
we don't need this word,
atheists or atheism and,

1426
01:23:54.790 --> 01:23:57.210
and we don't need to be,
we don't meet,

1427
01:23:57.220 --> 01:24:01.460
need to be a victim group that meets and bad hotels and talks about,
you know,

1428
01:24:01.480 --> 01:24:06.460
our identity.
Right.
And,
and,
um,
so,
and it was just,

1429
01:24:06.461 --> 01:24:10.750
it was just a fact that I had never,
it was just an accident,
but interesting.

1430
01:24:10.810 --> 01:24:15.520
True that the book that got me inducted into the,
the,
you know,
the,

1431
01:24:15.940 --> 01:24:19.570
the Pantheon of,
of,
of atheists in this generation.
Uh,

1432
01:24:19.720 --> 01:24:22.600
the end of faith was a book where I never use the word atheist.

1433
01:24:22.690 --> 01:24:24.550
I never thought I'd never suppressed the word atheist.

1434
01:24:24.551 --> 01:24:26.080
It just never occurred to me to use it.

1435
01:24:26.081 --> 01:24:29.500
I wasn't thinking in terms of atheists and I was thinking in terms of science

1436
01:24:29.501 --> 01:24:33.640
and common sense and evidence and you know,
the,
uh,
the obvious,

1437
01:24:33.820 --> 01:24:34.990
the for the flight,

1438
01:24:35.260 --> 01:24:38.800
flagrant violations of all that on the religious side of the conversation.

1439
01:24:39.160 --> 01:24:44.020
So I was,
um,
I don't think we,
we need the word,
I mean,
you know,

1440
01:24:45.550 --> 01:24:48.790
we can,
this is a debatable point politically.
Maybe,
maybe the,

1441
01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:53.800
maybe I'm wrong about this and it's useful or at least useful for a time.
But,
um,

1442
01:24:54.010 --> 01:24:57.340
I think what,
what was the second thing that you said in that?
And then,
so,

1443
01:24:57.350 --> 01:25:02.350
so then I followed that with a conversation about 20 minutes of my talking about

1444
01:25:03.340 --> 01:25:04.930
spirituality and,

1445
01:25:04.960 --> 01:25:09.010
and the contemplative experience of the sort I just mentioned here.

1446
01:25:09.610 --> 01:25:14.610
And I said that it was a problem in the atheist community that basically this

1447
01:25:14.980 --> 01:25:18.790
variable of atheism and,
and a,

1448
01:25:18.791 --> 01:25:23.260
a repudiation of religion was selecting for people who,

1449
01:25:23.320 --> 01:25:27.550
for the most part,
either hadn't had certain kinds of experiences or,

1450
01:25:27.650 --> 01:25:31.180
or viewed them as,
as just purely pathological.
Like,
these were people who,

1451
01:25:31.630 --> 01:25:35.170
you know,
hadn't done psychedelics or came away thinking,
well,

1452
01:25:35.171 --> 01:25:38.410
that was just madness.
Or that was,
you know,
those are just drug experiences.

1453
01:25:38.411 --> 01:25:43.110
And just that it has some deflationary accountable that,
that,
that,
uh,

1454
01:25:43.390 --> 01:25:46.240
basically said,
there's no there,
there,
you know,
there's nothing sacred.

1455
01:25:46.270 --> 01:25:48.130
We're just,
you know,
we're just bags of,

1456
01:25:48.160 --> 01:25:51.400
of chemicals and we're going to die and then nothing,

1457
01:25:51.460 --> 01:25:54.280
and then nothing happens thereafter.
Uh,

1458
01:25:54.400 --> 01:25:59.400
and it matters that you have people who don't have a real powers of

1459
01:26:02.900 --> 01:26:03.830
introspection.

1460
01:26:04.220 --> 01:26:09.050
So it's a notice notice that there's something profound to be gleaned by paying

1461
01:26:09.051 --> 01:26:13.190
attention to your experience.
And I used to be one of those people.
I mean,
I,

1462
01:26:13.191 --> 01:26:16.960
you know,
I've said that,
but for Psychedelics,
I think,
you know,
if you had,

1463
01:26:17.030 --> 01:26:21.920
if you had taught me to meditate when I was 18,
I think I,
I was,
uh,
I again,

1464
01:26:21.921 --> 01:26:24.320
I didn't think of myself as an atheist.
I didn't think in those categories,

1465
01:26:24.321 --> 01:26:27.770
but I was at,
I was a strident atheists.
And when I would meet someone,

1466
01:26:27.771 --> 01:26:32.420
I remember meeting someone and remember when they taught
it was in the,

1467
01:26:32.421 --> 01:26:35.630
in the great books seminar in as a freshman in college.

1468
01:26:35.990 --> 01:26:39.260
And the Bible was one of the great books.
And I remember just,
you know,

1469
01:26:39.261 --> 01:26:44.150
vilifying the Bible,
you know,
to my professor because I cause it just like,

1470
01:26:44.151 --> 01:26:48.510
what is this theocratic and sanity we're having to read here?
Like,
like,
shoot,

1471
01:26:48.940 --> 01:26:53.210
this is,
this is not nearly as good as the other stuff you're having us read.

1472
01:26:53.630 --> 01:26:58.040
And I'm meeting half the class that believes this stuff is not just a book.

1473
01:26:58.070 --> 01:27:01.220
Right.
It's like I was so,
it's funny to look back on that because I was like,

1474
01:27:01.850 --> 01:27:02.390
you know,

1475
01:27:02.390 --> 01:27:07.390
I was as militant and atheist as I ever was as a professional atheist and I

1476
01:27:08.691 --> 01:27:12.950
didn't even have the category of atheism in my head.
Right.
Uh,

1477
01:27:13.010 --> 01:27:14.320
but then I,
you know,

1478
01:27:14.400 --> 01:27:19.400
took MDM for the first time and took acid after that and discovered a range of

1479
01:27:20.241 --> 01:27:25.241
experience that I was just fundamentally blind to just cognitively,

1480
01:27:26.151 --> 01:27:29.400
emotionally,
and every other,
you know,
channel,
you know,

1481
01:27:29.490 --> 01:27:33.670
like this was a total revelation to me that it was possible to,

1482
01:27:34.080 --> 01:27:38.810
to have consciousness appear that way.
Right.
And have,
you know,

1483
01:27:38.811 --> 01:27:43.340
when you're,
when you're doing Mtma or when people are take,
you haven't done io,

1484
01:27:43.341 --> 01:27:46.130
Lasker,
right?
No.
Right.
Or when people would do all of these things,

1485
01:27:48.260 --> 01:27:50.960
how do you know where it,

1486
01:27:51.710 --> 01:27:56.390
where it's just something that you need inside you versus true or I guess that

1487
01:27:56.391 --> 01:28:00.930
you would count that as,
as true consciousness or true truth.

1488
01:28:01.590 --> 01:28:05.420
So whatever is true as a matter of reality out there,

1489
01:28:06.230 --> 01:28:11.230
one thing that can't be doubted is that you take one of these drugs and it

1490
01:28:11.991 --> 01:28:14.990
proves to you that it's possible to have a different kind of experience.

1491
01:28:15.690 --> 01:28:18.160
It could be psychosis,
right?
But like,

1492
01:28:18.230 --> 01:28:22.970
it's still instructive to realize that you,
you're having a,

1493
01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:28.000
you're tending to get up every morning and be very recognizable to yourself.

1494
01:28:28.940 --> 01:28:31.910
I mean,
you are very much like you were yesterday and you're,
and you're beat.

1495
01:28:31.940 --> 01:28:36.650
You're being buffeted within the bounds of,
uh,

1496
01:28:36.860 --> 01:28:41.510
you know,
positive and negative experience that is very familiar to you.

1497
01:28:41.960 --> 01:28:46.640
And at,
you know,
if you were at all like me at that,
at that point in my life,

1498
01:28:47.150 --> 01:28:51.800
there was absolutely nothing within that channel that was fundamentally

1499
01:28:51.801 --> 01:28:55.760
surprising in a way that would,
would,
uh,

1500
01:28:56.510 --> 01:28:59.180
answer to the name of spirituality or,

1501
01:28:59.270 --> 01:29:03.300
or anything for you like this.
There's nothing if,
if I,

1502
01:29:03.301 --> 01:29:06.690
if you had taken me into the religious section of the bookstore,
the,

1503
01:29:07.290 --> 01:29:12.000
or the mystical section of a bookstore,
I would read all of that and

1504
01:29:13.680 --> 01:29:16.440
it would be evocative of nothing for me.
It's like,

1505
01:29:16.441 --> 01:29:21.000
it's just like there's just these people that you're either conscious frauds or

1506
01:29:21.001 --> 01:29:23.490
they're suffering from some kind of psychopathology.
Right?

1507
01:29:23.880 --> 01:29:28.880
And that is what many atheists believe about somebody like Jesus or the Buddha

1508
01:29:29.510 --> 01:29:32.640
like this.
He's probably an epileptic,
right?
Um,

1509
01:29:32.670 --> 01:29:35.660
and we know that the temporal lobe epilepsy can give you,
you know,
you know,

1510
01:29:35.710 --> 01:29:39.040
or you know,
Migraine Auras can make you think you're having visions,
right?
So,
um,

1511
01:29:39.360 --> 01:29:43.650
this is the kind of thing you get from,
you know,
the James Randy's or the world,

1512
01:29:43.740 --> 01:29:47.550
right?
And I mean,
and it's no deep knock on James Randy.

1513
01:29:47.551 --> 01:29:51.990
I think he's done very important things for the skeptical community and to deep

1514
01:29:52.010 --> 01:29:53.340
bunk religious bullshit,

1515
01:29:53.341 --> 01:29:58.341
which again I think is dangerous and divisive and confusing and leads people to

1516
01:29:58.651 --> 01:29:59.790
waste a lot of time.

1517
01:29:59.791 --> 01:30:03.130
I mean it's just so you don't think that that line of thinking though the,

1518
01:30:03.131 --> 01:30:06.120
the James Randy line,
I think he just leaves you with enough of a,

1519
01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:10.050
of a human experience.
Is that a fair way to somebody else of a,

1520
01:30:10.060 --> 01:30:12.930
of a full experience as,
yeah,
you will.
It's just that there is,

1521
01:30:12.960 --> 01:30:17.960
there is something absolutely profound and even self transcending about what we

1522
01:30:21.031 --> 01:30:22.020
are subjectively.

1523
01:30:22.021 --> 01:30:26.310
I mean that's just the consciousness is consciousness is the only thing that

1524
01:30:26.311 --> 01:30:30.180
matters on some level.
It's the only space in which anything can matter.

1525
01:30:30.240 --> 01:30:35.110
It's the space in which values can be discovered.
It's the,
it's the,

1526
01:30:35.430 --> 01:30:40.430
the space in which we discover just how good or bad the universe can be.

1527
01:30:43.530 --> 01:30:47.040
Right?
I mean this,
this is the opportunity.
Everything else is just a thought.

1528
01:30:47.490 --> 01:30:52.490
Everything else is your memory of yesterday or your expectation of some future

1529
01:30:52.861 --> 01:30:56.490
moment where you are going to be conscious,
right?
So you're,
you're always,

1530
01:30:56.610 --> 01:30:57.300
you're always,

1531
01:30:57.300 --> 01:31:01.800
ever here in this space where the lights are on and if you went,

1532
01:31:01.801 --> 01:31:03.000
when the lights go off,
if you,
you know,

1533
01:31:03.001 --> 01:31:07.950
you lose consciousness and anesthesia or death or,
or deep sleep.

1534
01:31:07.950 --> 01:31:10.800
Although I think that the jury is still out on whether deep sleep is a,

1535
01:31:10.801 --> 01:31:15.160
is a state of unconsciousness,
uh,
you know,
then,

1536
01:31:15.360 --> 01:31:19.380
then there's just the absence of,
of all of that.
But here,

1537
01:31:19.410 --> 01:31:21.660
as a matter of you're your own subjectivity,

1538
01:31:22.200 --> 01:31:27.200
there is just this space and this is the space in which every mystic,

1539
01:31:27.600 --> 01:31:30.780
uh,
every founder of a religion,
every,
you know,

1540
01:31:30.810 --> 01:31:35.700
every person who's ever had his mind blown on psychedelics or an IOU on Iowasca

1541
01:31:35.701 --> 01:31:39.630
or every Shawman,
every like this is the space in which

1542
01:31:43.440 --> 01:31:47.970
epiphany's are had and claims true or false about the nature of reality are

1543
01:31:47.971 --> 01:31:52.910
made.
And the thing that has been overlooked to,
uh,

1544
01:31:52.980 --> 01:31:56.970
to an astonishing degree in the western tradition in particular,
is that,

1545
01:31:57.510 --> 01:32:01.390
is that introspection can be a methodology that is,
that,

1546
01:32:01.540 --> 01:32:06.540
that can be engaged with real intellectual honesty and a spirit of,

1547
01:32:07.001 --> 01:32:11.320
you know,
empirical,
you know,
first person,
empirical experiment,
uh,

1548
01:32:11.350 --> 01:32:16.120
it can now be correlated with third person methods of studying people's brains

1549
01:32:16.121 --> 01:32:18.370
while they have these kinds of insights.

1550
01:32:19.090 --> 01:32:23.840
But introspection was just still born in the west 150 years ago.
When,
you know,

1551
01:32:23.841 --> 01:32:25.120
people like William James,

1552
01:32:25.121 --> 01:32:30.121
we're trying to get it off the ground and what you have in place of a really

1553
01:32:32.320 --> 01:32:35.830
intelligent conversation about the nature of human consciousness,

1554
01:32:36.280 --> 01:32:41.280
you have people's lingering attachment to Judeo Christian religion in the West,

1555
01:32:44.800 --> 01:32:45.633
right?

1556
01:32:45.790 --> 01:32:50.790
Apart from what has been imported from something like Buddhism into science now,

1557
01:32:51.111 --> 01:32:51.671
I mean,
you have,
you know,

1558
01:32:51.671 --> 01:32:55.720
there's dozens of neuroscience labs now that study meditation and there,

1559
01:32:55.780 --> 01:33:00.400
you know,
a lot of the scientists are essentially closet Buddhists.
Uh,
but,

1560
01:33:01.210 --> 01:33:03.640
uh,
and this is,
this will,
this will be,

1561
01:33:03.641 --> 01:33:06.650
I'm sure if something Jordan and I disagree about,
or at least this'll,

1562
01:33:06.670 --> 01:33:10.660
this'll be a part of the conversation we need to have is that so much of what he

1563
01:33:10.661 --> 01:33:15.360
thinks is,
is profound and non negotiable and just,
just,
just ENR,

1564
01:33:15.361 --> 01:33:18.130
our bones based on our appearance in the West,

1565
01:33:18.160 --> 01:33:22.930
just necessary this Judeo Christian mishegoss he's got going on.
Um,

1566
01:33:23.710 --> 01:33:28.360
it's,
uh,
it's just not,
I mean it's just,
it actually isn't,

1567
01:33:28.750 --> 01:33:32.560
it's not doing,
it's not doing the necessary work he claims it is.

1568
01:33:33.010 --> 01:33:34.840
And even if it's war,
and again,

1569
01:33:34.841 --> 01:33:38.710
I'm not denying that you can't have certain experiences that seem meaningful

1570
01:33:39.340 --> 01:33:42.880
given that frame.
I mean there's,
you know,
before Jordan was doing this,
you know,

1571
01:33:42.881 --> 01:33:46.690
you had Joseph Campbell and the whole,
you know,
men's movement,
you know,

1572
01:33:46.691 --> 01:33:49.990
they had Robert Bly and you know,
other,
other people who were,

1573
01:33:50.020 --> 01:33:55.020
who were absolutely entranced by the power of story and you know,

1574
01:33:56.111 --> 01:34:00.430
all of the,
the,
the,
the history,
you know,
cross culturally of,
you know,

1575
01:34:00.490 --> 01:34:04.360
powerful stories being told and just how lives can be framed by story.

1576
01:34:05.230 --> 01:34:10.030
Yes.
That is part of,
you know,
possible range of human experience,

1577
01:34:10.031 --> 01:34:14.710
but there's something deeper than that and there's something that doesn't entail

1578
01:34:14.770 --> 01:34:15.603
any

1579
01:34:16.960 --> 01:34:20.450
parochial religious attachment and [inaudible] and so yeah,
I mean

1580
01:34:20.650 --> 01:34:24.070
<v 1>I'm much more focused on that level.
All right,
so I,
I do want us,</v>

1581
01:34:24.071 --> 01:34:25.680
since I've been spent so much time around Jordan,

1582
01:34:25.710 --> 01:34:28.840
I do want to kind of share some of my thoughts on that specifically,

1583
01:34:28.841 --> 01:34:30.790
but just to go back a few minutes,

1584
01:34:31.720 --> 01:34:34.230
I've had a few moments on the show when I found that if,

1585
01:34:34.270 --> 01:34:37.570
I think if someone's really telling the truth that you were like truly,

1586
01:34:37.571 --> 01:34:41.650
truly locked in and in the moment that I do feel something,

1587
01:34:42.190 --> 01:34:44.280
I can't quite explain it.
I'm sure I am.

1588
01:34:44.290 --> 01:34:47.470
Perhaps you've had experiences like this when you're really having a profound

1589
01:34:47.471 --> 01:34:50.980
moment with someone that there is a little bit of an aura,

1590
01:34:51.070 --> 01:34:54.220
like a little bit of something that's a little bit different.

1591
01:34:54.660 --> 01:34:58.370
And actually I actually had it in that moment that you were talking about that a

1592
01:34:58.370 --> 01:35:00.380
few months ago.
It's a fleeting,
it's just a bizarre,

1593
01:35:00.381 --> 01:35:02.330
fleeting thing that I can't quite explain,

1594
01:35:02.630 --> 01:35:06.440
but I've had it a few times and it's only happened when I felt that someone that

1595
01:35:06.441 --> 01:35:10.280
we were either really locked in at that level or I thought someone was truly

1596
01:35:10.281 --> 01:35:12.680
being as authentic as they possibly could be.

1597
01:35:13.310 --> 01:35:17.420
So as that was just happening just then,
what I really felt you were saying was

1598
01:35:18.100 --> 01:35:18.933
<v 0>be present.</v>

1599
01:35:19.310 --> 01:35:23.090
<v 1>I mean almost everything that you just said really was if we were all sort of</v>

1600
01:35:23.210 --> 01:35:27.830
truly being present at the highest level that we could be,

1601
01:35:27.860 --> 01:35:31.190
which is virtually impossible to do for more than a fleeting second.

1602
01:35:31.370 --> 01:35:33.230
And that's say you talk about that a lot of waking up,

1603
01:35:33.760 --> 01:35:37.280
but that's how we would achieve,
I think what you're looking for.
Is that a,

1604
01:35:38.210 --> 01:35:40.020
<v 0>a fair estimation?
Yeah.
Well,</v>

1605
01:35:40.021 --> 01:35:44.220
so I mean it's hard to do,
but it's not,

1606
01:35:44.221 --> 01:35:47.280
it's actually simple.
It's not complicated.
And so in this circumstance,

1607
01:35:47.281 --> 01:35:50.970
so you and I are having a conversation.
We're looking into each other's eyes.

1608
01:35:50.971 --> 01:35:55.290
This is a,
this is a experience that we all have all the time or meeting people.

1609
01:35:55.770 --> 01:36:00.720
Having these social encounters is so much of what makes us human and it's so

1610
01:36:00.721 --> 01:36:05.721
much of what makes the sense of self and their sense of self and other are

1611
01:36:05.790 --> 01:36:09.900
inextricably bound up.
And I,
I,
you know,
I would argue that they arise.

1612
01:36:10.020 --> 01:36:13.140
It's kind of kind of just really two sides of a single coin.

1613
01:36:13.890 --> 01:36:17.100
And so in a moment like this,

1614
01:36:17.280 --> 01:36:22.280
it's kind of two levels at which one could be mindful to use the,

1615
01:36:23.940 --> 01:36:26.040
the term of jargon that's now everywhere.
I mean,

1616
01:36:26.100 --> 01:36:31.100
mindfulness is just an ability to pay close attention to what it's like to be

1617
01:36:31.861 --> 01:36:35.730
you without grasping at what's pleasant or pushing away what's unpleasant and

1618
01:36:35.731 --> 01:36:37.320
without being lost in thought about it without,

1619
01:36:37.380 --> 01:36:41.340
without seeing every moment through this veil of thought.
So,
so you and I,

1620
01:36:41.341 --> 01:36:44.670
so the conventional circumstances,
you and I are having a conversation.

1621
01:36:45.030 --> 01:36:47.400
We're looking at one another and yet

1622
01:36:49.740 --> 01:36:50.573
we're both,

1623
01:36:50.850 --> 01:36:55.500
we're both inundated by are the automaticity of our own discursive thought.

1624
01:36:55.501 --> 01:36:58.710
So you're talking,
I'm trying to listen to what you're saying,

1625
01:36:59.070 --> 01:37:02.330
but I'm being distracted by my own thinking.
Right?

1626
01:37:02.331 --> 01:37:04.410
So you say something and I think,
oh go,
wait,
I'm going to say,

1627
01:37:04.770 --> 01:37:06.290
what am I going to say to that?
You know?

1628
01:37:06.630 --> 01:37:11.630
And so that that contest between the contents of my own mind and just giving you

1629
01:37:12.901 --> 01:37:17.310
my attention,
that's something that people are living with all the time.
And they,

1630
01:37:17.311 --> 01:37:21.930
if they're not meditators,
they only notice it when things are just,

1631
01:37:22.250 --> 01:37:25.080
when it just things run completely off the rails.

1632
01:37:25.081 --> 01:37:27.960
So you're reading a book and you realize,
okay,

1633
01:37:27.961 --> 01:37:32.220
I've read this page three times and I still don't know what's on the page.

1634
01:37:32.280 --> 01:37:34.980
Or like I've just gone down.
It's like,
so then you're just,

1635
01:37:34.981 --> 01:37:36.870
you're just a malfunctioning robot at that point.

1636
01:37:36.871 --> 01:37:39.920
Like you're just here thinking so much that you can't pay attention to what you

1637
01:37:39.921 --> 01:37:44.060
know you want to pay attention to.
And what we have that interpersonal.

1638
01:37:44.190 --> 01:37:45.120
So the first,

1639
01:37:45.610 --> 01:37:50.610
how real game would be to be someone who in a circumstance like this can just

1640
01:37:52.651 --> 01:37:54.930
notice the difference between being lost in thought.

1641
01:37:55.170 --> 01:37:58.440
Really just being focused on the other person,

1642
01:37:58.441 --> 01:38:02.820
then who's paying attention and to sort of secure that in a,
in a,

1643
01:38:03.460 --> 01:38:03.741
uh,

1644
01:38:03.741 --> 01:38:08.741
a more frequent way by just get letting go of your thoughts and coming back and

1645
01:38:09.270 --> 01:38:10.200
paying attention.
Right.

1646
01:38:10.230 --> 01:38:14.160
But oddly thinking about that actually reinforces it in a weird way,

1647
01:38:14.161 --> 01:38:16.180
which is part of the say the first problem.

1648
01:38:16.240 --> 01:38:19.620
It's not a matter of thinking about it better matter of just just kind of

1649
01:38:19.621 --> 01:38:23.640
granting your attention again and like there's nothing to hold on to the moment

1650
01:38:23.641 --> 01:38:28.490
you notice you're thinking,
you just come back to,
to paying attention.
Uh,
but the,

1651
01:38:28.500 --> 01:38:32.730
the further insight,
which tends to only come once you're,

1652
01:38:32.740 --> 01:38:37.740
you get pretty good at the first kind of mindfulness is to notice that this

1653
01:38:38.671 --> 01:38:42.570
feeling of being a self over here,

1654
01:38:42.571 --> 01:38:44.800
a feeling of being behind your face.
You know,
I mean,

1655
01:38:44.940 --> 01:38:49.940
so the feeling that you have that I'm looking at you right,

1656
01:38:50.011 --> 01:38:51.540
the feeling that I'm looking at something,

1657
01:38:51.870 --> 01:38:53.760
the feeling that you are there to be looked at,

1658
01:38:54.300 --> 01:38:57.150
the feeling that you are an object in the world for me.

1659
01:38:57.900 --> 01:39:00.240
That if you look for that,

1660
01:39:00.241 --> 01:39:02.910
if you look for yourself in this moment,

1661
01:39:03.720 --> 01:39:08.720
you can fail to find it in a way that really does change your experience.

1662
01:39:08.761 --> 01:39:11.910
Like at like the sense of of being a self,

1663
01:39:11.911 --> 01:39:16.911
the sense of being the center of consciousness can drop out in a way that just

1664
01:39:17.920 --> 01:39:22.080
just leaves the world.
It justly and it,
it leaves me in the world,

1665
01:39:22.110 --> 01:39:24.210
but it leaves me.
It's like lately there's only one face.

1666
01:39:24.211 --> 01:39:25.980
You see at this moment you don't see your face.

1667
01:39:26.110 --> 01:39:29.910
You just see mine and then obviously I'm in the opposite situation,

1668
01:39:30.330 --> 01:39:34.620
but when I'm paying attention to you,
when I'm really paying attention to you,

1669
01:39:35.280 --> 01:39:39.090
I lose the sense that I'm over here paying attention to you.

1670
01:39:39.091 --> 01:39:43.200
I mean there really is just the world and you are part of it and that,

1671
01:39:43.260 --> 01:39:47.910
I mean that's the insight that's often described as as emptiness or or the or

1672
01:39:47.940 --> 01:39:52.170
selflessness in in a Buddhist context.
And you can have that.

1673
01:39:52.200 --> 01:39:55.140
Obviously you don't have that in,
you don't need another person to have that.

1674
01:39:55.141 --> 01:39:59.490
You can have that looking at a coffee cup a or even with your eyes closed but

1675
01:40:00.540 --> 01:40:05.540
with another person it's really vivid because so much or so much of our sense of

1676
01:40:06.601 --> 01:40:11.250
of being a self as ramified by being in relationship and I I care what you think

1677
01:40:11.251 --> 01:40:12.031
of me or like you,

1678
01:40:12.031 --> 01:40:17.031
you make a facial expression and I'm react like what does that mean for like how

1679
01:40:17.131 --> 01:40:17.730
do you see me?

1680
01:40:17.730 --> 01:40:22.140
It's like we're constantly doing this dance with one another where we're reading

1681
01:40:22.141 --> 01:40:27.141
in the other person's phase how we're doing and that you know that's something

1682
01:40:29.101 --> 01:40:33.110
that you can have the experience of just dropping that entirely and it's,

1683
01:40:33.530 --> 01:40:37.830
it's amazingly frame to drop that entirely because you know all of your

1684
01:40:38.130 --> 01:40:43.130
psychological suffering and all of your sense of being imperiled in relationship

1685
01:40:45.001 --> 01:40:49.710
to other people is is anchored to the sense of I'm me over here are vulnerable

1686
01:40:49.711 --> 01:40:54.711
to the thoughts and whims and and and malicious behavior of others and it's

1687
01:40:55.571 --> 01:41:00.571
possible to just cancel that if by by paying close enough attention to what is

1688
01:41:01.210 --> 01:41:04.480
what consciousness is like.
The thing is that consciousness

1689
01:41:06.310 --> 01:41:11.310
consciousness doesn't feel like a self with the feeling of self is is that yet

1690
01:41:13.271 --> 01:41:17.500
another object in consciousness?
It's a c is something,

1691
01:41:18.610 --> 01:41:20.200
I mean this is again this is I'm,
I'm,

1692
01:41:20.440 --> 01:41:22.420
I'm not making a claim about the physics of things.
I'm not,

1693
01:41:22.570 --> 01:41:25.750
this is not Deepak Chopra saying that the universe is just consciousness or

1694
01:41:25.860 --> 01:41:28.780
[inaudible] consciousness was here before the big bang or anything like that.

1695
01:41:28.781 --> 01:41:30.880
But the sense,

1696
01:41:31.240 --> 01:41:33.970
and I'm not making any claim that consciousness isn't the product of brains,

1697
01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.040
but subjectively speaking,

1698
01:41:37.330 --> 01:41:41.680
your sense that consciousness is in your head is mistaken.

1699
01:41:41.710 --> 01:41:45.070
You head is in consciousness.
You're the feeling of having a head,

1700
01:41:45.670 --> 01:41:49.180
the feeling of having a phase.
All of that is,

1701
01:41:49.360 --> 01:41:51.670
is appearing in consciousness in this moment.

1702
01:41:51.671 --> 01:41:56.671
It's just as much in consciousness as your thoughts are as the,

1703
01:41:58.090 --> 01:42:00.960
the,
the world is as sounds are.
I mean so,

1704
01:42:01.140 --> 01:42:06.140
so like the feeling that you're inside of something is subjectively has things

1705
01:42:07.091 --> 01:42:08.600
backwards.
You can,

1706
01:42:08.601 --> 01:42:12.190
you can feel vividly that every,

1707
01:42:12.191 --> 01:42:16.630
that everything you experienced in each moment is just a matter of consciousness

1708
01:42:16.631 --> 01:42:17.500
and its contents.

1709
01:42:18.070 --> 01:42:23.070
And the more you keep dropping back into that position of just being the space

1710
01:42:23.141 --> 01:42:24.850
in which everything is arising,

1711
01:42:25.510 --> 01:42:29.860
then you can notice that it doesn't actually feel like what you take yourself to

1712
01:42:29.861 --> 01:42:33.730
be in most moments,
which is this,
this feeling of,
of being in a cell for being,

1713
01:42:33.731 --> 01:42:37.250
uh,
uh,
a subject in a riding around in the,

1714
01:42:37.370 --> 01:42:39.850
in the middle of everything appropriate in it.

1715
01:42:41.080 --> 01:42:43.420
So I sort of had one of those moments there.
Yeah.

1716
01:42:43.421 --> 01:42:45.640
I mean I was trying to do it right then,
that guy already,

1717
01:42:45.641 --> 01:42:48.940
I'm trying to do it as a listening.
Well,
no,
you can,
you can try to do it.

1718
01:42:48.941 --> 01:42:51.580
I mean you can,
it's not that that's,

1719
01:42:52.060 --> 01:42:54.580
it's not that all efforts to do it are doomed.
I mean you can,

1720
01:42:54.610 --> 01:42:59.440
you can learn how to look for this thing and,

1721
01:42:59.680 --> 01:43:04.630
and then find it in a way that cancels the sense that there was anyone looking

1722
01:43:05.020 --> 01:43:09.430
or,
and this,
there are ways to,
there broadly speaking,

1723
01:43:09.431 --> 01:43:13.900
there's are two ways to do this that you can,
uh,
and again this is,

1724
01:43:13.930 --> 01:43:17.680
this is what meditation is.
There's different styles of meditation but,

1725
01:43:17.920 --> 01:43:20.080
but they're really only two ways to do this.

1726
01:43:20.081 --> 01:43:25.081
You can either look for the self you think you have in a disciplined enough way

1727
01:43:26.651 --> 01:43:28.720
and a clear enough way in a way where you're,
you're,

1728
01:43:29.070 --> 01:43:32.400
you're no longer lost in thought and you can actually pay attention to
something.

1729
01:43:32.420 --> 01:43:37.420
You have enough concentration to pay attention and you look for yourself and

1730
01:43:37.421 --> 01:43:37.780
you've,

1731
01:43:37.780 --> 01:43:41.680
and you've in that first moment of looking and you fail to find it in a way that

1732
01:43:41.681 --> 01:43:45.040
is,
shows you that there's,
it's not there yet.

1733
01:43:45.041 --> 01:43:47.260
Everything else is still here and the world is still here.

1734
01:43:47.680 --> 01:43:51.290
The lights are still on.
That's one method.

1735
01:43:51.291 --> 01:43:55.460
Another method is to pay close enough attention to anything else.
I mean,

1736
01:43:55.461 --> 01:43:59.180
whether it's a sound or your breath or sites or another person,

1737
01:43:59.690 --> 01:44:04.690
and recognize that when you're truly paying undistracted attention,

1738
01:44:06.680 --> 01:44:10.430
you in that moment of seeing say a Coffee Cup,

1739
01:44:11.090 --> 01:44:15.680
there really is just seeing there's not a seer and the things seen,

1740
01:44:15.710 --> 01:44:17.000
there's not that,
you know,

1741
01:44:17.690 --> 01:44:22.690
I mean that really is what it's like to be continually tiling the world with

1742
01:44:23.421 --> 01:44:26.600
concepts.
You're just,
you're just,
you know,
it's a,

1743
01:44:27.110 --> 01:44:30.920
it is a kind of undercurrent of thought in each moment that you're identified

1744
01:44:30.921 --> 01:44:35.800
with and not noticing.
So if,
so a lot of techniques of meditation or just pain,

1745
01:44:35.900 --> 01:44:39.260
such scrupulous attention to an object,

1746
01:44:39.261 --> 01:44:43.610
a seeming object that you eventually collapse the distance between subject and

1747
01:44:43.611 --> 01:44:47.330
object.
And that's it man.
It's a more conventional approach of,
of mindfulness.
So

1748
01:44:47.680 --> 01:44:50.460
<v 1>I got to tell you,
Sam,
I think that getting off Twitter,
yeah,
sorry,</v>

1749
01:44:50.650 --> 01:44:54.760
it was probably the whole thing that like what might really be in there.

1750
01:44:54.761 --> 01:44:55.191
All right,
so let,

1751
01:44:55.191 --> 01:44:58.090
let's talk about a little bit of the specifics of the Jordan because obviously

1752
01:44:58.390 --> 01:45:02.620
we've done about 20 of these shows together.
I can tell you've been,

1753
01:45:02.680 --> 01:45:05.070
you've been on a major tour with him were,
you know,

1754
01:45:05.140 --> 01:45:07.440
I came home now if we're just like two or three days and then,

1755
01:45:07.441 --> 01:45:10.870
and then we head out again.
Um,
you know,
I think you know,

1756
01:45:10.871 --> 01:45:13.360
that I come more from a position of,

1757
01:45:13.590 --> 01:45:18.590
of a lack of belief that a position of belief is sort of where I inherently

1758
01:45:18.731 --> 01:45:21.970
start.
Probably similar to the way you described yourself at 18

1759
01:45:24.160 --> 01:45:25.960
from every,
now he's different every night.

1760
01:45:25.990 --> 01:45:27.940
Every night that we've done one of these,
he,
you know,

1761
01:45:28.180 --> 01:45:29.950
I open it up and makes people laugh.

1762
01:45:29.950 --> 01:45:32.410
He does about an hour and a half every single night.
It's been different.

1763
01:45:32.411 --> 01:45:35.140
So some nights he's talking about the fate of the West.

1764
01:45:35.141 --> 01:45:37.430
Some nights he talks about the sovereignty of the individual.

1765
01:45:37.431 --> 01:45:40.660
So I'm 19 gives you the 12 rules that are in the book it cemetery.

1766
01:45:40.661 --> 01:45:41.590
He mixes it up every night.

1767
01:45:42.640 --> 01:45:46.000
But at some point there always something that whittles down to something about

1768
01:45:46.001 --> 01:45:50.230
truth and belief of course
from what I can,
I don't want to,

1769
01:45:51.070 --> 01:45:53.380
as Eric would say,
if we're going to do this,
we should as Eric Wise,

1770
01:45:53.381 --> 01:45:54.220
I would say if we're going to do this,

1771
01:45:54.221 --> 01:45:57.700
we should probably try to steal man him properly and maybe he'll watch this and

1772
01:45:57.701 --> 01:45:59.920
I told them that we were going to do this.
So you know,

1773
01:45:59.980 --> 01:46:01.840
hopefully it offers a little something for both of you guys.

1774
01:46:02.770 --> 01:46:07.630
I never see him pushing the straight up idea of religion on people.

1775
01:46:07.640 --> 01:46:11.050
Now he is doing,
he's doing it through the prism that you described,

1776
01:46:11.051 --> 01:46:14.440
the sort of Judeo Christian prism of things where he's talking about these

1777
01:46:14.441 --> 01:46:19.030
stories and what I sensed that he's really hitting on that is resonating with

1778
01:46:19.031 --> 01:46:24.031
people and it does resonate with me even is that the power of these stories,

1779
01:46:24.220 --> 01:46:26.080
and maybe this is sort of the Joseph Campbell thing,

1780
01:46:26.860 --> 01:46:31.860
the power of these stories does offer some other transcendent truth that you

1781
01:46:32.530 --> 01:46:34.720
cannot get another way.

1782
01:46:34.750 --> 01:46:38.440
So the way that I can give it to you in a way that sort of makes sense to me,

1783
01:46:38.470 --> 01:46:42.430
to me is that,
you know,
although I didn't really like the last couple movies,

1784
01:46:42.431 --> 01:46:45.460
that the amount that I've loved star wars in my life,

1785
01:46:45.490 --> 01:46:48.610
the way that the stories of star wars,
right,
that they,

1786
01:46:48.611 --> 01:46:51.480
those stories of star wars have more relevance to what,

1787
01:46:51.481 --> 01:46:56.430
how I sort of view good and evil and,
and,
um,

1788
01:46:56.520 --> 01:47:00.570
the journey that you're on as a person.
Um,

1789
01:47:00.930 --> 01:47:05.390
they have more value to me than anything that I ever read out of biblical
things.

1790
01:47:05.391 --> 01:47:07.950
So I'm not taking his biblical version of it,

1791
01:47:08.310 --> 01:47:12.330
but that the power of story can somehow offer you some other,

1792
01:47:13.230 --> 01:47:18.230
some map to truth that I don't think necessarily is in conflict with anything

1793
01:47:18.661 --> 01:47:23.250
you've said.
Does that,
no,
I'm not,
I'm not giving you poorly what his argument is.

1794
01:47:23.251 --> 01:47:25.410
I'm just giving you sort of my personal take.

1795
01:47:25.690 --> 01:47:28.990
<v 0>Yeah.
No,
but I'm,
I'm aware of,
of what he's been saying in this regard and yeah.</v>

1796
01:47:29.080 --> 01:47:33.370
And,
um,
and I think this is where maybe you guys got a little lost in that first

1797
01:47:33.460 --> 01:47:37.120
conversation that yet.
I mean,
so just as a general matter,

1798
01:47:37.960 --> 01:47:42.580
I love much of what he says he's does with some regularity.

1799
01:47:42.581 --> 01:47:46.900
Say something ridiculous enough with the same confidence.

1800
01:47:46.901 --> 01:47:51.520
He says all the good things that I perceive a real problem with what he's doing.

1801
01:47:51.560 --> 01:47:55.870
Me An example of one of those just for,
well,
I mean,
did you see his uh,

1802
01:47:56.380 --> 01:47:58.900
event with Matt Dillahunty?
You see that?
I didn't see it,

1803
01:47:58.901 --> 01:48:03.550
but I know a lot of people have been taught that's worth watching,
but so,
so,
uh,

1804
01:48:03.650 --> 01:48:04.960
and again,
I'm hoping,

1805
01:48:05.770 --> 01:48:10.770
my hope is that we can make progress in these conversations where we don't get

1806
01:48:11.351 --> 01:48:15.100
stuck just having a knock down drag out over,

1807
01:48:15.160 --> 01:48:18.430
over things like the points I'm going to raise now,

1808
01:48:18.830 --> 01:48:21.590
<v 1>but by the way,
real quick for the record,
just,
I'm more than happy to tell you,</v>

1809
01:48:21.591 --> 01:48:23.930
like,
he I think is in that same exact spot.

1810
01:48:23.931 --> 01:48:27.170
He wants it to be fruitful and friendly and all of those things,

1811
01:48:27.171 --> 01:48:29.030
which I think goes back to what we talked about,
you know,

1812
01:48:29.031 --> 01:48:31.820
an hour ago about just the way we all relate to each other.

1813
01:48:32.240 --> 01:48:34.970
<v 0>Right?
But I mean,
he'll confidently say things like,
you know,</v>

1814
01:48:36.010 --> 01:48:39.470
atheists aren't really atheists.
I mean,
like there's,
I really atheists,

1815
01:48:39.471 --> 01:48:41.280
there's a psychopath who murders people.
I mean,

1816
01:48:41.281 --> 01:48:42.440
so there are those people have existed,

1817
01:48:42.441 --> 01:48:44.690
but someone like Sam Harris or Richard Dawkins,

1818
01:48:44.691 --> 01:48:48.950
or maybe you said this directly to Matt Dillahunty in this case,
uh,
they're not,

1819
01:48:49.040 --> 01:48:50.690
they only think they're atheist,
not really atheist.

1820
01:48:50.691 --> 01:48:53.570
They have a god and that's functioning in their life and then just not

1821
01:48:53.600 --> 01:48:57.140
acknowledging it.
Right.
Um,
you know,
there,
and again,
it comes back,

1822
01:48:57.170 --> 01:49:00.560
it comes back to this historical claim that we all grew up in the west.

1823
01:49:00.950 --> 01:49:05.150
We're all,
we all just got our ethics and our,

1824
01:49:05.480 --> 01:49:09.680
our theology without ever naming it.
We got it in the water.
Right.
And,

1825
01:49:10.250 --> 01:49:11.083
um,

1826
01:49:11.120 --> 01:49:15.500
so any sense you have of what is good and worth doing?

1827
01:49:16.050 --> 01:49:17.900
Uh,
any sense you have a value?

1828
01:49:17.940 --> 01:49:21.230
Just the reason why it would be bad to murder somebody.
Uh,

1829
01:49:21.231 --> 01:49:25.220
the reason why you don't have to think that through from first principles every

1830
01:49:25.220 --> 01:49:26.900
day,
uh,
and you,

1831
01:49:26.990 --> 01:49:30.770
and you can just navigate the social space with other people in the West.

1832
01:49:31.100 --> 01:49:36.100
It's because you are just fundamentally dependent on these stories,

1833
01:49:38.660 --> 01:49:43.650
this tradition,
right.
And this,
this God,
and he's very,
you know,
uh,

1834
01:49:43.730 --> 01:49:48.010
I don't know what the steel man interpretation of what he's actually doing is

1835
01:49:48.011 --> 01:49:52.780
here,
but to my eye,
he's very,
yeah,

1836
01:49:52.820 --> 01:49:57.760
they're evasive or,
or a noncommittal about what he means by God.
But he's,
he,

1837
01:49:57.761 --> 01:49:59.860
he's,
however he's using the word,

1838
01:49:59.861 --> 01:50:04.480
he's not making a clear claim about what he believes.
He'll often say,
oh,

1839
01:50:04.510 --> 01:50:06.670
it would take me 40 hours to answer that.

1840
01:50:06.671 --> 01:50:10.600
Or I wrote a 600 page book on that and I can't,
if I go like he,
he will,

1841
01:50:10.720 --> 01:50:13.570
he will decline to answer a fairly straightforward question about what he

1842
01:50:13.571 --> 01:50:17.270
believes about Jesus or about God or so made the buys.

1843
01:50:17.290 --> 01:50:19.570
We'll get somewhere around that.
He doesn't,
I don't think,

1844
01:50:19.571 --> 01:50:22.150
I think I could probably count on one hand how many times he's actually

1845
01:50:22.151 --> 01:50:24.000
mentioned God's specifically in the,

1846
01:50:24.100 --> 01:50:27.040
in the course of all this cause he likes the stories and the Matt and what he

1847
01:50:27.041 --> 01:50:30.340
would say are the maps of meaning I think are much more important to him than

1848
01:50:30.820 --> 01:50:35.140
the,
to agree on the exact definition of God.
But the,
but the claim for instance,

1849
01:50:35.141 --> 01:50:39.460
that I am in a way that I fundamentally don't understand,

1850
01:50:39.461 --> 01:50:44.461
but he does that I am captive of the Judeo Christian tradition right there.

1851
01:50:46.211 --> 01:50:51.211
My ethics is born of it and that my notion of ultimate value is somehow anchored

1852
01:50:52.541 --> 01:50:55.030
to Jesus.
Right.
Uh,

1853
01:50:55.530 --> 01:50:59.900
I mean that is just so preposterous as to be unarguable.
Right.

1854
01:50:59.901 --> 01:51:02.930
This is Shania Shapiro would take a similar argument just not related to gt

1855
01:51:02.980 --> 01:51:05.300
Jesus though he,
I think he would say something similar.
Right?
Because I,

1856
01:51:05.320 --> 01:51:07.660
because my mother was Jewish,
presumably he would think I'm,
you know,

1857
01:51:07.810 --> 01:51:12.010
Jewish rather than Judeo Christian or that he would say that your enlightenment

1858
01:51:12.011 --> 01:51:14.740
values.
I mean,
I think when I've done this with him,
because we'd say if I say,

1859
01:51:14.741 --> 01:51:16.930
well,
all the goodness in me,
the things that I believe in,

1860
01:51:16.931 --> 01:51:20.530
the moral principles that I believe in are really enlightened about as he would

1861
01:51:20.531 --> 01:51:24.490
say,
well,
you really have to dial it back to where else not proving the point.

1862
01:51:24.491 --> 01:51:28.450
He thinks he's proven with it.
Right.
So it's,
um,
but these are the,

1863
01:51:28.451 --> 01:51:32.050
I mean these are like points of confusion.
Yeah.
I think we could get behind it,

1864
01:51:32.051 --> 01:51:33.250
get passing in five minutes,

1865
01:51:33.251 --> 01:51:37.390
but it's also possible that he's going to dig in for two hours on this and then

1866
01:51:37.391 --> 01:51:38.650
we'll have three more events to do.

1867
01:51:38.651 --> 01:51:41.900
And I'm not sure what the hell's going to happen.
So,
um,
but I,
I mean,

1868
01:51:41.901 --> 01:51:46.780
I really hope to make progress with him because again,
I think,
uh,

1869
01:51:46.870 --> 01:51:50.020
I think what he's doing is very interesting on,

1870
01:51:50.530 --> 01:51:55.390
on other fronts and what he is exposed is a real need,

1871
01:51:55.391 --> 01:51:59.680
a real hunger for a meaning based conversation about,
you know,

1872
01:52:00.190 --> 01:52:04.930
how do you get your life straight in a,
you know,
in the 21st century.
Um,

1873
01:52:05.740 --> 01:52:07.240
and I mean clearly,

1874
01:52:07.270 --> 01:52:12.270
clearly there's a hunger for wisdom that the secular community has not been

1875
01:52:12.371 --> 01:52:15.100
answering any kind of reliable way.

1876
01:52:15.130 --> 01:52:19.820
And so we want to hear from people who are saying,
well,
you know,
I'm going to,

1877
01:52:19.821 --> 01:52:24.380
I've been an atheist,
but you know,
what I'm hearing from Peterson is,
you know,

1878
01:52:25.240 --> 01:52:28.380
really causing me to get my life together.
Uh,

1879
01:52:28.900 --> 01:52:31.690
that just tells me that it's no surprise.

1880
01:52:31.691 --> 01:52:34.010
I've said this about atheism for ever since I was talking about atheism.

1881
01:52:34.010 --> 01:52:36.550
Atheism is not a philosophy.
Atheism has nothing.

1882
01:52:37.150 --> 01:52:41.920
Atheism is just a denial of the fall certainties of religious people.

1883
01:52:42.190 --> 01:52:45.530
It's like,
no,
there's no,
there's no good reason to believe in Poseidon.

1884
01:52:45.800 --> 01:52:49.220
And there's no good reason to believe in Yahweh.
That's atheism,
right?

1885
01:52:49.520 --> 01:52:54.520
So atheism doesn't give you anything that makes you live a meaningful life and

1886
01:52:55.490 --> 01:53:00.380
that's not,
but the thing is Contra Peterson,
that's not a knock on atheism.

1887
01:53:00.590 --> 01:53:05.170
That's all the atheism.
Atheism is just not being convinced by the,

1888
01:53:05.210 --> 01:53:09.080
the bad religion,
the bad evidence and arguments put forward by religious people.

1889
01:53:09.410 --> 01:53:14.150
It leaves just a space for better conversations that you may or may not have.

1890
01:53:14.151 --> 01:53:17.510
You may or may not discover,
you may or may not fall in love with science and,

1891
01:53:18.020 --> 01:53:19.500
and a rational approach to,

1892
01:53:19.670 --> 01:53:24.140
to the contemplative life in a weird way as someone that wants to connect

1893
01:53:24.350 --> 01:53:26.030
atheism to spirituality.

1894
01:53:26.330 --> 01:53:30.620
The failure of whatever the atheist movement before you was,

1895
01:53:31.250 --> 01:53:31.461
you know,

1896
01:53:31.461 --> 01:53:36.461
weird ways is kind of good because you want to lead atheism to a future,

1897
01:53:37.041 --> 01:53:40.900
right?
Like I'm completely unconcerned by atheism.
I'm,

1898
01:53:40.901 --> 01:53:45.560
I'm concerned about the future.
Right?
It's like,
you know,
but the,
again,

1899
01:53:45.561 --> 01:53:48.680
the place where Peterson and I will,

1900
01:53:48.830 --> 01:53:51.530
we'll have disagreed and we'll disagree is,
I mean I think he,

1901
01:53:51.920 --> 01:53:54.940
I don't think he understands atheism or I've never heard him say anything that

1902
01:53:55.190 --> 01:53:59.070
that is an accurate portrayal of what it's like to be,
you know,

1903
01:53:59.120 --> 01:54:03.290
this sort of atheist or certainly many atheists.
I know,
um,

1904
01:54:04.010 --> 01:54:06.000
sort of reframing your experience.
Yes.
You,

1905
01:54:06.030 --> 01:54:11.030
but the truth is you can do that with stories that you know,

1906
01:54:11.091 --> 01:54:14.870
to be bullshit.
Like you,
you can do that with Batman.
While I'm telling you,

1907
01:54:14.871 --> 01:54:17.950
I mean,
I know star wars is a true story.
Nobody it has no,
but may be,

1908
01:54:17.951 --> 01:54:19.610
but you could decide like,
I'm gonna,

1909
01:54:19.640 --> 01:54:24.640
I'm gonna get up each morning and think of myself as Luke Skywalker.

1910
01:54:25.530 --> 01:54:27.980
Like,
you know,
you're not Luke Skywalker.
Well,
you know,

1911
01:54:27.981 --> 01:54:32.120
Luke Sky Walker was invented by someone who in your lifetime,
right?

1912
01:54:32.121 --> 01:54:34.790
So there's no,
so deep thing going back to our DNA,
right.

1913
01:54:34.791 --> 01:54:39.320
This is just the Luke Skywalker and you can do it.
And,
and perhaps,
you know,

1914
01:54:39.500 --> 01:54:41.120
perhaps Jordan would want to say,
well,
no,

1915
01:54:41.121 --> 01:54:45.110
it looks Skywalker does go back to the DNA because Joseph Campbell was really in

1916
01:54:45.111 --> 01:54:48.920
touch with these ancient myths and it was Joseph Campbell who gave George Lucas

1917
01:54:48.921 --> 01:54:52.430
all of his story's structure.
Okay.
Leave it aside.
You could do it with that.

1918
01:54:52.431 --> 01:54:55.190
You pick the most preposterous character you want.

1919
01:54:55.700 --> 01:54:59.900
They could still conceivably be inspiring Spiderman,
right?
Um,

1920
01:55:00.710 --> 01:55:02.540
you could get up tomorrow and say,
I'm,
you know,

1921
01:55:02.541 --> 01:55:07.541
I'm just going to view each situation of the day that I encounter through the

1922
01:55:08.691 --> 01:55:12.800
lens of what would spider man do you know,
what,

1923
01:55:12.801 --> 01:55:16.490
how would Spiderman Act here?
How I'm walking into a Starbucks,
right?

1924
01:55:16.491 --> 01:55:18.500
I feel sort of vaguely neurotic,
right?

1925
01:55:18.501 --> 01:55:20.900
I'm gonna about to meet the Barista and I'm like,
you know,

1926
01:55:21.380 --> 01:55:23.220
having trouble making eye contact,
right?
I'm,

1927
01:55:23.230 --> 01:55:26.120
I'm that I'm the same neurotic person I was yesterday,

1928
01:55:26.810 --> 01:55:31.280
but how would Spiderman do this,
right?
Like,
and how would,
how would,

1929
01:55:31.460 --> 01:55:36.460
if I knew that I could just take down everyone in this place if I wanted to and

1930
01:55:37.581 --> 01:55:41.990
I can use,
shoot a web and fly over a building,
right?
If I knew that about myself,

1931
01:55:42.020 --> 01:55:46.110
how would I navigate each subsequent moment here?
That the truth,

1932
01:55:46.140 --> 01:55:49.020
the truth of the matter is that changes your psychology.

1933
01:55:49.230 --> 01:55:54.180
You can do it with total fictitious bullshit,
right?
It's a trick.
It's a,
it's a,

1934
01:55:54.181 --> 01:55:58.140
it's a mind hack,
right?
That's the same game,
right?

1935
01:55:58.320 --> 01:55:59.720
It doesn't require,
and,

1936
01:55:59.730 --> 01:56:03.510
and it doesn't require young to be right about the collective unconscious.

1937
01:56:03.930 --> 01:56:07.860
Now you could say,
well,
it only works if there really is something that the,

1938
01:56:08.430 --> 01:56:12.750
you know,
the substrate layer that is ancient and,
and spooky,

1939
01:56:13.190 --> 01:56:17.950
um,
that,
that's an empirical claim that,
you know,
may be on falsifiable or,

1940
01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:22.230
or maybe worth debating.
But the reality is,
is that stories have power.

1941
01:56:22.620 --> 01:56:27.360
Even if you,
you and some stories have more power than others,
right?

1942
01:56:27.361 --> 01:56:29.480
And we can talk about,
you know,
how,
why,

1943
01:56:29.481 --> 01:56:34.200
what makes a certain story more compelling or structured in a way that that's

1944
01:56:34.201 --> 01:56:38.580
more compelling.
But the reality is that the mind is,

1945
01:56:39.090 --> 01:56:44.090
is plastic to a remarkable degree and are our persistence in having the same

1946
01:56:44.821 --> 01:56:48.600
mediocre,
mediocre experience we had yesterday.
Is,

1947
01:56:48.960 --> 01:56:53.960
is a kind of habit and you can create other habits that are more inspiring and

1948
01:56:55.621 --> 01:56:57.930
more more useful.
And yes,

1949
01:56:57.931 --> 01:57:01.410
it is totally possible to use some traditional framework to do that.

1950
01:57:01.590 --> 01:57:05.850
Or some weird cultic framework.
I mean,
someone can invent a new,

1951
01:57:06.300 --> 01:57:09.720
you know,
a new operating system and you know,

1952
01:57:09.721 --> 01:57:13.750
and call it Scientology or call it whatever,
and uh,

1953
01:57:13.770 --> 01:57:18.360
gather acolytes under that,
in that context.
And even the,

1954
01:57:18.570 --> 01:57:21.150
and this is how weird our circumstances,
you can have a,

1955
01:57:21.210 --> 01:57:25.230
a malicious fraud doing that.
And someone like l Ron Hubbard,

1956
01:57:25.231 --> 01:57:28.260
who was clearly a con man,
right?
Uh,

1957
01:57:29.310 --> 01:57:31.560
and people can derive genuine benefit from it.

1958
01:57:31.561 --> 01:57:34.710
It's not like every Scientologists as wrong about the benefit they got from

1959
01:57:34.711 --> 01:57:37.440
Scientology.
It's clearly they're not right.
It wouldn't,

1960
01:57:37.870 --> 01:57:41.280
wouldn't persist to the degree that it has if everyone's just having a bad time

1961
01:57:41.790 --> 01:57:44.550
and seeing no benefit ever.
Right.
It's not,

1962
01:57:44.551 --> 01:57:48.300
it's not co would be over in a day.
Well,
they're sweating,
load all that.

1963
01:57:48.520 --> 01:57:51.540
<v 1>Yeah,
that's right.
Whenever they're doing in the sauna.
So.
All right.
So then that,</v>

1964
01:57:51.541 --> 01:57:53.560
I think maybe we can wrap it with that cause I don't want to,

1965
01:57:54.990 --> 01:57:57.240
I'm not here to litigate obviously on,
on behalf of door.

1966
01:57:57.250 --> 01:58:00.300
And I thought if you could just get some of these ideas,
we'll,

1967
01:58:00.450 --> 01:58:03.120
I'm sure we'll get into house.
What's the date of the first one?

1968
01:58:03.860 --> 01:58:08.260
<v 0>Um,
you would,
people would have to check my website.
July.
Or is it,
no,</v>

1969
01:58:08.270 --> 01:58:10.580
the first one,
it's the end of this month in Vancouver.

1970
01:58:10.581 --> 01:58:13.840
We've got two shows like the 23rd and fourth I think.
Yeah.

1971
01:58:14.300 --> 01:58:17.270
And then we've got Dublin and London in July,

1972
01:58:17.271 --> 01:58:21.630
middle of July 14th I think.
Is Dublin in the 16th as London could have.

1973
01:58:21.680 --> 01:58:22.510
It could be a day off there.

1974
01:58:22.510 --> 01:58:26.860
<v 1>Well I have him back in here on the 29th so that'll be right in between the two.</v>

1975
01:58:26.861 --> 01:58:31.690
So maybe that'll be an interesting spot to them.
Yeah.
Yeah.
All right.

1976
01:58:31.691 --> 01:58:35.050
So then my final thing on this and then we can wrap would be,
so what

1977
01:58:36.760 --> 01:58:39.040
<v 0>does it matter at the end of the day?
Let's say,</v>

1978
01:58:39.550 --> 01:58:41.980
let's say everything you've said here is,
and,
and

1979
01:58:41.980 --> 01:58:46.240
<v 1>a certain amount of people watching this can can start going down that road and</v>

1980
01:58:46.241 --> 01:58:50.170
finding truth that allows them to live as presently and honestly and,

1981
01:58:50.200 --> 01:58:51.970
and fulfillingly as possible.

1982
01:58:52.390 --> 01:58:56.350
And let's say for the amount of people that are showing up to Jordan's events,

1983
01:58:56.740 --> 01:59:01.570
they hear what he's saying and feel that it allows them to do that exact same

1984
01:59:01.571 --> 01:59:02.404
thing.

1985
01:59:02.590 --> 01:59:06.430
Whether you believe that that skimming off the top are not fully actualizing

1986
01:59:06.520 --> 01:59:11.320
open,
but they ultimately live a good life.
That is,
you know,

1987
01:59:11.321 --> 01:59:14.500
that the life that's coming from what you're prescribing to what Jordan's

1988
01:59:14.501 --> 01:59:18.880
prescribing ultimately both become comparably moral,
decent,

1989
01:59:18.910 --> 01:59:23.910
good lives at the end of the day then does it matter?

1990
01:59:25.080 --> 01:59:29.130
<v 0>Well,
I think having a coherent idea about truth matters.</v>

1991
01:59:29.190 --> 01:59:33.780
And so this is a sticking point that Jordan and I hit in our first podcast and

1992
01:59:34.580 --> 01:59:38.160
uh,
I see it operating in a lot of what he's saying.
And so that,

1993
01:59:38.190 --> 01:59:42.420
that I think should be ironed out and I think it can be ironed out and you can

1994
01:59:42.421 --> 01:59:47.421
still be totally enamored of the usefulness of myth where like you can still

1995
01:59:50.910 --> 01:59:54.420
like almost nothing else shifts in what he's doing.

1996
01:59:54.690 --> 01:59:59.690
And you can still acknowledge that there's a difference between this is what,

1997
02:00:00.131 --> 02:00:04.440
what Bret Weinstein I think usefully dubbed metaphorical truth and the literal

1998
02:00:04.441 --> 02:00:05.274
truth.

1999
02:00:05.640 --> 02:00:09.570
And it's only by the light of literal truth that you can even make that

2000
02:00:09.571 --> 02:00:10.620
distinction,
right?
Like,

2001
02:00:10.621 --> 02:00:15.540
like clearly we need those two categories and we need to be able to say that

2002
02:00:16.080 --> 02:00:20.640
certain things are not literally true,
but they're useful,

2003
02:00:21.180 --> 02:00:25.770
right?
And certain things are,
uh,
to starkly false.
So I mean,

2004
02:00:25.771 --> 02:00:27.690
they don't even have to have no truth to them.
I mean,

2005
02:00:27.700 --> 02:00:31.890
someone could just be miss fundamentally mistaken about reality and that could

2006
02:00:31.891 --> 02:00:35.940
be,
there are certain circumstances or under what circumstances under which that

2007
02:00:35.941 --> 02:00:37.680
could be useful,
right?
So it's like,
like,

2008
02:00:37.710 --> 02:00:42.710
like to make those distinctions is the only way to preserve a notion of truth

2009
02:00:43.950 --> 02:00:48.150
that gets you something like a legitimate science and legitimate error

2010
02:00:48.151 --> 02:00:53.151
correcting mechanism where it really matters that your beliefs both be

2011
02:00:54.271 --> 02:00:55.200
internally consistent,

2012
02:00:55.201 --> 02:01:00.180
your belief system internally consistent and map onto reality in some way that

2013
02:01:00.181 --> 02:01:04.770
is,
uh,
you know,
if they were false,
you'd be unlikely to believe what you believe.

2014
02:01:04.830 --> 02:01:07.450
I mean that.
But the problem is what people are getting and this is,
you know,

2015
02:01:07.470 --> 02:01:12.060
traditionally what religion has been and what,
what dogmatism always gives you.

2016
02:01:12.430 --> 02:01:12.601
I mean,

2017
02:01:12.601 --> 02:01:17.601
dogmatism is the state of no longer interacting with reality in a way that

2018
02:01:19.141 --> 02:01:21.360
would,
that would error correct your beliefs.

2019
02:01:21.390 --> 02:01:23.940
Like I'm going to believe this thing that I believed yesterday.

2020
02:01:23.941 --> 02:01:26.820
No matter what you tell me,
no matter what you show me,

2021
02:01:27.060 --> 02:01:31.210
no matter what happens in human history,
Jesus is the son of God,
right?
Whatever,

2022
02:01:31.290 --> 02:01:35.940
whatever it is,
right?
Uh,
that's,
that's religion.
It traditionally speaking.

2023
02:01:36.420 --> 02:01:41.420
And that is precisely the state in which the human mind and human communities

2024
02:01:43.490 --> 02:01:47.690
can't error correct and make intellectual progress.
So clearly that's not,

2025
02:01:48.140 --> 02:01:51.050
that part is not worth preserving.
Uh,

2026
02:01:51.200 --> 02:01:55.730
and to some degree I perceive Jordan is trying to have it both ways and uh,

2027
02:01:55.731 --> 02:01:59.960
he'll,
he'll be,
he'll endorse science in,
in,
you know,
various ways,

2028
02:01:59.961 --> 02:02:04.910
but he will also endorse,
and he won't call it dogmatism,

2029
02:02:04.911 --> 02:02:07.330
but I'm perceiving it to be dogmatism into them.

2030
02:02:07.330 --> 02:02:11.150
And that's something that I certainly hope that we can flesh out and converge
on.

2031
02:02:11.180 --> 02:02:14.720
So it's good that you guys are doing for these because each one is going to sort

2032
02:02:14.721 --> 02:02:17.960
of be like a discovery session until yeah.

2033
02:02:17.990 --> 02:02:21.160
Until you can get enough of an agreement on that sort of base level stuff and,

2034
02:02:21.161 --> 02:02:24.480
and yeah,
you may end up just lost in the weeds on it,
but we have,
we,

2035
02:02:24.600 --> 02:02:29.510
unlike my podcast,
we have a moderator really in all four times.

2036
02:02:30.020 --> 02:02:33.830
Doug Douglas is doing something with Bret Weinstein's going to is actually a

2037
02:02:33.831 --> 02:02:36.440
moderator for Vancouver.
So he knows his job and,

2038
02:02:36.441 --> 02:02:39.090
and I think he'll be great at it.
Uh,

2039
02:02:39.890 --> 02:02:43.790
Douglas Murray is joining us in London and Dublin and he is not a moderator,

2040
02:02:43.791 --> 02:02:47.570
but I think just,
just having Douglas there will keep us from,

2041
02:02:48.260 --> 02:02:50.760
from missing each other.
Totally.
I mean they'd Douglas Bro,
smart,

2042
02:02:52.130 --> 02:02:55.070
very calming effect on all this.
Uh,
all right,

2043
02:02:55.071 --> 02:02:57.570
well I don't think we should go two years again before we go,

2044
02:02:57.860 --> 02:02:59.760
before we do this again and we have it,

2045
02:02:59.800 --> 02:03:03.470
we should also say we have a conference coming up in,
in New York in November,

2046
02:03:03.500 --> 02:03:08.130
which you are our m scene.
And,
um,
this is actually,
this is,

2047
02:03:08.740 --> 02:03:11.490
this is very cool.
Could have an idea.
You've been bouncing around for awhile.

2048
02:03:11.550 --> 02:03:14.000
Yeah.
Why don't you tell her this is a,

2049
02:03:14.030 --> 02:03:18.410
rather than avoid controversial topics for this,
this conference,

2050
02:03:18.411 --> 02:03:19.550
we decided to just,

2051
02:03:20.250 --> 02:03:23.480
just rams toward the most provocative.

2052
02:03:23.481 --> 02:03:28.030
And so we have a session on me too.
I think it's titled,

2053
02:03:28.031 --> 02:03:31.870
it has me to gone too far and it's going to be a panel of,
uh,

2054
02:03:32.240 --> 02:03:37.070
women,
all women journalists.
I think that's true to say.
Uh,

2055
02:03:37.220 --> 02:03:42.110
and fantastic people like Masha Gessen and a very wise and,

2056
02:03:42.530 --> 02:03:45.290
uh,
Katie Roiphe.
Um,

2057
02:03:45.350 --> 02:03:48.900
Rebecca Traister I don't think can make it,
but the,

2058
02:03:50.260 --> 02:03:54.290
we're still building it out,
but it's,
it will be the full spectrum of yes.

2059
02:03:54.290 --> 02:03:57.200
Has Gone too far to,
hasn't gone far enough.
It'll,

2060
02:03:57.240 --> 02:03:59.480
it should be a very interesting conversation.
Uh,

2061
02:03:59.540 --> 02:04:02.810
there's a panel on race with Glen Lowery who,

2062
02:04:02.840 --> 02:04:07.820
you know is fantastic and I'm pretty sure we're Tanahashi coats is going to do

2063
02:04:07.821 --> 02:04:12.230
it.
And so Tom House,
he is just as far to the,
to the,
the,

2064
02:04:12.850 --> 02:04:16.520
uh,
extreme racial side of this as a possible.

2065
02:04:16.521 --> 02:04:21.440
So you just wanted to thrust me in the middle of this thing and see what

2066
02:04:21.441 --> 02:04:22.400
happens.
Um,

2067
02:04:22.970 --> 02:04:26.500
and we always wish all have to talk about how that stuff gets moderated.
But um,

2068
02:04:26.600 --> 02:04:30.440
and then it's got a,
Coleman used this,
this,

2069
02:04:30.441 --> 02:04:34.730
a young crazy on undergraduate who's writing these,

2070
02:04:35.200 --> 02:04:37.130
these pieces in Colette,
uh,

2071
02:04:37.200 --> 02:04:40.370
to give you a sense of just how weird the the left is.
So,
so Coleman,

2072
02:04:40.380 --> 02:04:43.170
he has written these,
these pieces on race and Colette,

2073
02:04:43.171 --> 02:04:47.450
he's this African American undergraduate at Columbia writing these essays that,

2074
02:04:47.530 --> 02:04:51.780
that so many of us have found,
uh,
uh,
just,

2075
02:04:52.110 --> 02:04:56.490
just one incredibly well written,
right.
I mean,
just,
he does not have any of the,

2076
02:04:56.491 --> 02:04:59.340
the affectations of someone who's overriding and those age,

2077
02:04:59.341 --> 02:05:01.640
which is just amazingly rare.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2078
02:05:02.160 --> 02:05:06.780
And just so clear headed,
right.
And,
uh,

2079
02:05:06.810 --> 02:05:10.200
so I retweeted one of his essays saying like,
congratulations,

2080
02:05:10.380 --> 02:05:15.050
Coleman and I just decided to check my app mentions justice,

2081
02:05:15.160 --> 02:05:18.480
just not just to take the temperature of the situation.

2082
02:05:18.900 --> 02:05:22.050
And this is more evidence of my racism that I'm,

2083
02:05:22.230 --> 02:05:27.090
that I'm favorably re-tweeting if like this,
this uncle Tom,
as you'd expect.

2084
02:05:27.610 --> 02:05:30.570
Uh,
so,
uh,
it's amazing.
But anyway,

2085
02:05:30.600 --> 02:05:34.610
that again will be a panel that spans the full range of opinion on,

2086
02:05:34.640 --> 02:05:37.110
on these topics,
on this topic of race.
And the question is,

2087
02:05:37.111 --> 02:05:41.340
can we get beyond race?
And then there's a panel on Islam that we'll have,

2088
02:05:42.150 --> 02:05:46.210
uh,
Majid and I on who,
you know,
are all stars on the,
you know,

2089
02:05:46.230 --> 02:05:49.290
I would argue the perfectly sane side of this conversation,

2090
02:05:49.770 --> 02:05:53.670
but it will also have Fareed Zakaria and,
and Shadi Hamid who,

2091
02:05:54.510 --> 02:05:55.343
you know,

2092
02:05:55.590 --> 02:05:59.880
I view it as the kind of intervention on those guys because like you to my ear,

2093
02:05:59.890 --> 02:06:02.250
they've just been making the wrong noises on this.
And I did,

2094
02:06:02.251 --> 02:06:06.210
I've done the podcast with both of them,
but me being a white guy,

2095
02:06:06.211 --> 02:06:11.160
non Muslim,
you know,
who didn't grow up in the culture,
uh,
there's,
there's,

2096
02:06:11.190 --> 02:06:14.700
there's certain moves not opened to me for,
you know,

2097
02:06:14.760 --> 02:06:19.280
the kind of audience that will be persuaded by someone.
Like Fareed are shoddy,

2098
02:06:19.350 --> 02:06:22.350
saying you don't understand the Muslim experience or whatever it is.

2099
02:06:22.351 --> 02:06:27.090
So obviously they can't do that.
Talking to [inaudible] and Majid,
um,

2100
02:06:27.210 --> 02:06:28.021
or Sarah Haider.

2101
02:06:28.021 --> 02:06:31.140
And so all of those people will be on the panel and that should be fascinating.

2102
02:06:31.660 --> 02:06:32.493
Uh,

2103
02:06:33.150 --> 02:06:37.740
and then finally there's a panel that Fareed is actually going to go to
moderate,

2104
02:06:37.741 --> 02:06:41.970
which is a [inaudible] truth is,
I'm on it.
I don't know who else is gonna be on,

2105
02:06:41.971 --> 02:06:45.720
I think is going to be Eric Weinstein and Bret Weinstein and a few other people,

2106
02:06:45.721 --> 02:06:49.290
and it'll just be talking about rationality and know his reason sacred as the

2107
02:06:49.291 --> 02:06:52.560
title of that panel.
And you're doing a meditation session.
Oh yeah.

2108
02:06:52.561 --> 02:06:54.960
I think I'm going to do a meditation workshop in that,

2109
02:06:54.961 --> 02:06:58.680
so it's like a 10 hour day,
but uh,

2110
02:06:58.740 --> 02:07:01.170
it shouldn't get to be good after all this moderation.

2111
02:07:01.171 --> 02:07:05.650
I'm going to need a little [inaudible] to come by for that and said her for that

2112
02:07:05.651 --> 02:07:07.830
one.
Okay.
All right.
Well,
it's always a pleasure my friend.

2113
02:07:08.250 --> 02:07:11.840
Don't follow him on Twitter because I won't be getting there,

2114
02:07:12.600 --> 02:07:16.350
but you can check out the waking up podcast@samharris.org.
