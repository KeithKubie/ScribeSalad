internet access is such a fundamental

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069
internet access is such a fundamental
 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.499
internet access is such a fundamental
part of learning that by extension it is

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509
part of learning that by extension it is
 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.160
part of learning that by extension it is
almost certainly a human right within a

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170
almost certainly a human right within a
 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.700
almost certainly a human right within a
very short period of time it will be

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:18.710
very short period of time it will be
 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.790
very short period of time it will be
particularly because of those who don't

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800
particularly because of those who don't
 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.269
particularly because of those who don't
have schools those who have to do their

have schools those who have to do their
 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.660
have schools those who have to do their
learning on their own and for them

yes internet access will be a human

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789
yes internet access will be a human

right at the moment it's it's edging up

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480
right at the moment it's it's edging up
 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.450
right at the moment it's it's edging up
to it and probably not everybody agrees

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460
to it and probably not everybody agrees
 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.060
to it and probably not everybody agrees
but they will shortly because i believe

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070
but they will shortly because i believe

the internet is a human right we can

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270
the internet is a human right we can
 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.029
the internet is a human right we can
look at the number of people on the

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039
look at the number of people on the
 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.790
look at the number of people on the
internet at the moment which is anywhere

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800
internet at the moment which is anywhere
 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.130
internet at the moment which is anywhere
between two or three billion people

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140
between two or three billion people
 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.570
between two or three billion people
depending how you count out of seven and

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580
depending how you count out of seven and
 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.870
depending how you count out of seven and
the next billion is a little bit like

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880
the next billion is a little bit like
 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.910
the next billion is a little bit like
low-hanging fruit you can do some

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920
low-hanging fruit you can do some
 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.460
low-hanging fruit you can do some
regulatory changes you can do some

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470
regulatory changes you can do some
 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.070
regulatory changes you can do some
subsidies you can you can bring the next

billion in quite easily to me I'm much

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850
billion in quite easily to me I'm much
 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.280
billion in quite easily to me I'm much
more interested in the last billion

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290
more interested in the last billion
 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.190
more interested in the last billion
because the last billion people are a

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200
because the last billion people are a
 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.069
because the last billion people are a
technology problem in many ways they're

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079
technology problem in many ways they're
 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.590
technology problem in many ways they're
a cultural problem they're in low

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600
a cultural problem they're in low
 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.609
a cultural problem they're in low
density areas mostly rural there they're

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619
density areas mostly rural there they're
 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.420
density areas mostly rural there they're
just many challenges which make the two

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430
just many challenges which make the two
 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.580
just many challenges which make the two
problems the next billion and the last

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590
problems the next billion and the last
 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.340
problems the next billion and the last
billion different problems and i'm

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350
billion different problems and i'm
 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.200
billion different problems and i'm
interested always in the harder problem

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210
interested always in the harder problem
 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.389
interested always in the harder problem
in the one that may be normal market

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399
in the one that may be normal market
 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:55.190
in the one that may be normal market
forces won't do and so i have been

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200
forces won't do and so i have been
 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.039
forces won't do and so i have been
involved in the past six eight months in

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049
involved in the past six eight months in
 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.429
involved in the past six eight months in
trying to bring the internet to those

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439
trying to bring the internet to those
 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.300
trying to bring the internet to those
last billion people and because they are

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310
last billion people and because they are
 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.949
last billion people and because they are
in low density rural areas I focused on

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959
in low density rural areas I focused on
 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:12.440
in low density rural areas I focused on
geostationary satellites not just

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450
geostationary satellites not just
 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.630
geostationary satellites not just
because

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640
because
 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.910
because
they have a big footprint but because

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920
they have a big footprint but because
 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.880
they have a big footprint but because
they're there and fifty percent of the

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890
they're there and fifty percent of the
 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.030
they're there and fifty percent of the
bandwidth over Africa for example is not

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040
bandwidth over Africa for example is not
 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.650
bandwidth over Africa for example is not
being used at the moment so there's a

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660
being used at the moment so there's a
 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.500
being used at the moment so there's a
lot of unused capacity you can move

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510
lot of unused capacity you can move
 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.420
lot of unused capacity you can move
satellites quite easily and then you can

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430
satellites quite easily and then you can
 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.100
satellites quite easily and then you can
launch a satellite so there's a pretty

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110
launch a satellite so there's a pretty
 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.740
launch a satellite so there's a pretty
orderly schedule for for how you would

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750
orderly schedule for for how you would
 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.450
orderly schedule for for how you would
do this and then the other thing which

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460
do this and then the other thing which
 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:39.800
do this and then the other thing which
people forget is that the liability in

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810
people forget is that the liability in
 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.680
people forget is that the liability in
the asset of geostationary satellites

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690
the asset of geostationary satellites
 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.220
the asset of geostationary satellites
are the same namely if you're going up

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230
are the same namely if you're going up
 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.290
are the same namely if you're going up
22,500 miles and back down again it's a

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300
22,500 miles and back down again it's a
 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.320
22,500 miles and back down again it's a
pretty long round trip the latency the

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330
pretty long round trip the latency the
 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.720
pretty long round trip the latency the
power all of those issues but Africa is

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730
power all of those issues but Africa is
 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.340
power all of those issues but Africa is
the same as Europe as far as the

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350
the same as Europe as far as the
 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.260
the same as Europe as far as the
satellites concerned so if the

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270
satellites concerned so if the
 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.770
satellites concerned so if the
satellites position somewhere in an

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780
satellites position somewhere in an
 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.350
satellites position somewhere in an
orbital slot over Africa on the equator

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360
orbital slot over Africa on the equator
 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.330
orbital slot over Africa on the equator
it sort of looks down to the right and

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340
it sort of looks down to the right and
 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.190
it sort of looks down to the right and
sees Africa looks down to the left sees

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200
sees Africa looks down to the left sees
 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.630
sees Africa looks down to the left sees
Europe so you can build a system that

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640
Europe so you can build a system that
 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.940
Europe so you can build a system that
serves Africa by landing in Europe

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950
serves Africa by landing in Europe
 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.590
serves Africa by landing in Europe
because one of the reasons you don't

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600
because one of the reasons you don't
 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.650
because one of the reasons you don't
want to land in Africa is that that the

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660
want to land in Africa is that that the
 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.170
want to land in Africa is that that the
sort of backbone of the internet in

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180
sort of backbone of the internet in
 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.470
sort of backbone of the internet in
Africa is quite costly and landing in

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480
Africa is quite costly and landing in
 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.540
Africa is quite costly and landing in
Europe is not very costly so you could

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550
Europe is not very costly so you could
 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.050
Europe is not very costly so you could
have what's called a you know a farm of

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060
have what's called a you know a farm of
 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.660
have what's called a you know a farm of
dishes in some location in Europe that

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670
dishes in some location in Europe that
 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.979
dishes in some location in Europe that
serves Africa not the long term solution

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989
serves Africa not the long term solution
 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:42.050
serves Africa not the long term solution
but a very quick short term solution and

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060
but a very quick short term solution and
 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.690
but a very quick short term solution and
I believe that one should be doing these

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700
I believe that one should be doing these
 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.850
I believe that one should be doing these
things now with resolve there's no

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860
things now with resolve there's no
 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.640
things now with resolve there's no
there's no technical hoback it's just a

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650
there's no technical hoback it's just a
 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.729
there's no technical hoback it's just a
couple of billion dollars to do it and

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739
couple of billion dollars to do it and
 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:55.340
couple of billion dollars to do it and
that's what we spend in Afghanistan and

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350
that's what we spend in Afghanistan and
 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.830
that's what we spend in Afghanistan and
one week so it's it's it's this isn't

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840
one week so it's it's it's this isn't
 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.470
one week so it's it's it's this isn't
