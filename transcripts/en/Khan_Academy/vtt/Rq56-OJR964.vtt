00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.950
- [Voiceover] William has
a 26-liter glass tank.

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:06.220
First, he wants to put some marbles in it,

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:08.260
all of the same volume.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.450
Then, he wants to fill the tank with water

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:12.190
until it's completely full.

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:15.350
If he uses 85 marbles, he will have

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:19.780
to add 20.9 liters of water.

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:22.990
What is the volume of each marble?

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:24.420
All right, so let's think about it.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.020
The volume of the marbles
plus the volume of the water

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.330
are going to be equal to
the volume of the tank.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.210
They're going to fill up the tank.

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:32.690
Let me write that down.

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:36.320
So the volume, let me write V,

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.310
V and I'll write a
little subscript M here.

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:40.620
This is the volume of the marbles

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.488
plus the volume of the water,

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.952
plus the volume of the water,

00:00:45.952 --> 00:00:49.323
are going to be equal to
the volume of the tank.

00:00:49.323 --> 00:00:52.910
Are going to be equal to
the volume of the tank.

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.720
Now, we don't know what the volume

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.640
of 85 marbles is,

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.520
but we know, this right over here,

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:01.310
this is going to be

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:05.110
85 times the volume of one marble.

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.390
So this is volume of all the marbles,

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:08.980
and maybe, I'll just write it out,

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.700
volume, volume

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.310
of one marble, one marble.

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:16.090
I'll write it out.

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:17.520
I could've put a variable in there,

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.150
but just to make it clear.

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.072
So 85 times the volume of one marble,

00:01:21.072 --> 00:01:23.590
that's gonna be the total
volume of the marbles,

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.470
plus the volume of water.

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.800
They tell us what the volume of water is.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.190
20.9 liters of water, plus 20.9

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.770
is gonna be equal to the
volume of the entire tank.

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.580
It's a 26-liter glass tank,

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.440
so it's gonna be equal to 26.

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.570
Remember, the whole thing
that's going on here is

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.450
he wants to fill up the whole tank.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.950
He puts some marbles in
it that have some volume,

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.960
and then whatever's left,
he fills it with water.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.680
So these two volumes combined

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.120
have to add up to the
volume of the entire tank.

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.890
Now, what is the, now we can just solve

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.110
for the volume of one marble.

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.220
And actually maybe I'll just,

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.790
let's just call this the variable M.

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.500
Let's just call this, let's call it M

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.198
for the volume of one marble.

00:02:10.744 --> 00:02:12.997
So we get 85,

00:02:13.977 --> 00:02:17.037
we get 85 times M,

00:02:17.037 --> 00:02:19.947
maybe I'll just do this in one
color for the sake of time,

00:02:19.947 --> 00:02:23.687
plus 20.9 is equal to 26.

00:02:23.687 --> 00:02:27.417
Now, to solve for M we can
subtract 20.9 from both sides.

00:02:27.417 --> 00:02:30.017
So subtract 20.9,

00:02:30.017 --> 00:02:33.157
subtract 20.9 from both sides,

00:02:33.157 --> 00:02:36.697
and we get 85 times

00:02:36.697 --> 00:02:38.717
the volume of one marble

00:02:38.717 --> 00:02:42.577
is equal to, let's see, 26 minus 21

00:02:42.577 --> 00:02:43.987
would have been five,

00:02:43.987 --> 00:02:46.021
so this is gonna be five point...

00:02:49.037 --> 00:02:51.785
Right, this is gonna be 5.1,

00:02:51.785 --> 00:02:55.797
It's gonna be five, 5.1,

00:02:55.797 --> 00:02:57.887
or we can say the volume of each marble

00:02:57.887 --> 00:02:59.997
if we divide both sides by 85

00:02:59.997 --> 00:03:04.067
is 5.1 liters over 85.

00:03:04.067 --> 00:03:06.487
And I could calculate, let's see,

00:03:07.597 --> 00:03:08.987
let me just get a calculator out for this.

00:03:08.987 --> 00:03:10.957
We're allowed to use
calculators on this one.

00:03:10.957 --> 00:03:14.047
And so we get 5.1

00:03:14.047 --> 00:03:16.487
divided by 85,

00:03:16.487 --> 00:03:20.377
is equal to 0.06 liters,

00:03:20.377 --> 00:03:23.317
is equal to 0.06.

00:03:23.317 --> 00:03:24.917
So what is the volume of each marble?

00:03:24.917 --> 00:03:28.887
We just figured out 0.06 liters.

00:03:28.887 --> 00:03:30.727
And then how much water is necessary

00:03:30.727 --> 00:03:35.157
if William uses 200 marbles?

00:03:35.157 --> 00:03:36.757
So let's think about it.

00:03:36.757 --> 00:03:39.187
How much water would be necessary?

00:03:39.187 --> 00:03:42.337
Let's see, the volume, let's just say W

00:03:42.337 --> 00:03:44.577
is the amount of water that's necessary.

00:03:44.577 --> 00:03:47.590
And it's gonna be a function
of the number of marbles,

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.067
the number of marbles, and let's see,

00:03:51.067 --> 00:03:53.387
if you have, if you have no marbles

00:03:53.387 --> 00:03:54.957
you're going to have to put 26 liters,

00:03:54.957 --> 00:03:57.351
you have to fill the whole
glass tank, the whole volume.

00:03:57.351 --> 00:03:59.414
So it's going to be equal to 26,

00:04:00.417 --> 00:04:02.247
minus the volume of the marbles.

00:04:02.247 --> 00:04:04.917
Well, what's the volume of
the marbles going to be?

00:04:04.917 --> 00:04:07.727
Well it's going to be the
volume of each marble.

00:04:07.727 --> 00:04:10.987
It's going to be 0.06

00:04:10.987 --> 00:04:13.517
times the number of marbles you have,

00:04:13.517 --> 00:04:16.177
times the number of marbles you have.

00:04:16.177 --> 00:04:18.457
Just like that we've
described a linear function

00:04:18.457 --> 00:04:20.277
that tells us how much
water we have to fill

00:04:20.277 --> 00:04:21.827
as a function of marbles.

00:04:21.827 --> 00:04:23.417
It's gonna be the total volume of the tank

00:04:23.417 --> 00:04:25.717
minus the volume of the marbles,

00:04:25.717 --> 00:04:27.197
and the volume of the marbles is the

00:04:27.197 --> 00:04:30.817
volume per marble times
the number of marbles.

00:04:30.817 --> 00:04:34.017
So if they're saying how much
water we need for 200 marbles,

00:04:34.017 --> 00:04:37.057
that's going to be W, the amount of water

00:04:37.057 --> 00:04:38.747
we have to fill as a function of marbles,

00:04:38.747 --> 00:04:41.097
where now the number of marbles is 200.

00:04:41.097 --> 00:04:45.579
That's going to be equal to 26 minus

00:04:45.579 --> 00:04:50.457
0.06 times 200,

00:04:50.457 --> 00:04:52.927
times 200.

00:04:52.927 --> 00:04:54.917
And what's that going to be?

00:04:54.917 --> 00:04:57.427
Well let's see, six times,

00:04:57.427 --> 00:05:01.087
this is six hundredths.

00:05:01.087 --> 00:05:04.357
Six hundredths times a hundred

00:05:04.357 --> 00:05:06.197
would be six,

00:05:06.197 --> 00:05:07.397
but now we're multiplying 200,

00:05:07.397 --> 00:05:11.057
so this is gonna be 12, so
this thing right over here,

00:05:11.057 --> 00:05:14.457
this thing right over here
is going to be equal to 12.

00:05:14.457 --> 00:05:18.757
And then 26 minus 12 is 14.

00:05:18.757 --> 00:05:22.017
So all of this, we need
to write it like this,

00:05:22.017 --> 00:05:25.187
all of this is going to be equal to 14.

00:05:25.187 --> 00:05:28.487
So how much water is necessary
if William uses 200 marbles?

00:05:28.487 --> 00:05:30.862
14 liters of water.

00:05:30.862 --> 00:05:35.523
26 minus 0.06 times 200.
