EVERY NOW AND AGAIN I LIKE TO
CHECK IN WITH OUR GOOD FRIENDS

00:00:03.803 --> 00:00:08.574 line:91%
ON THE FOX NEWS NETWORK-- OR--
OR AS YOUR GRANDPARENTS CALL IT

00:00:08.607 --> 00:00:10.376 align:start position:0% line:85%
"THE REAL NEWS."

00:00:10.409 --> 00:00:13.246 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND TO BE FRANK, OFTENTIMES THIS
SHOW IS CRITICAL OF FOX.

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:16.082 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT ONLY BECAUSE THEY'RE
TERRIBLE.

00:00:16.115 --> 00:00:19.619 align:start position:0% line:91%
( LAUGHTER )
LIKE SOMETIMES ALMOST SHOCKINGLY

00:00:19.652 --> 00:00:20.853 align:start position:0% line:85%
TERRIBLE.

00:00:20.887 --> 00:00:23.256 align:start position:0% line:91%
FOR INSTANCE, TWO WEEKS AGO, THE
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT RELEASED A

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:25.358 align:start position:0% line:91%
REPORT ON THE FERGUSON, MISSOURI
POLICE DEPARTMENT SHOOTING OF

00:00:25.391 --> 00:00:26.993 align:start position:0% line:85%
MICHAEL BROWN.

00:00:27.026 --> 00:00:30.596 line:91%
BASICALLY EXONERATING OFFICER
DARREN WILSON AND DEBUNKING THE

00:00:30.629 --> 00:00:32.565 align:start position:0% line:91%
HANDS UP, DON'T SHOOT,
NARRATIVE.

00:00:32.598 --> 00:00:36.569 line:91%
AND THEN THEY RELEASED A SECOND
D.O.J. REPORT STATING THAT THE

00:00:36.602 --> 00:00:38.371 line:91%
FERGUSON, MISSOURI ROUTINELY
VIOLATES THE CONSTITUTION AND

00:00:38.404 --> 00:00:43.176 align:start position:0% line:91%
FEDERAL LAW WITH A PATTERN OF
RACIAL BIAS, UNREASONABLE FORCE,

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:47.246 align:start position:0% line:91%
INTENTIONAL DISCRIMINATION AND
MISTREATMENT OF DETAINEES

00:00:47.279 --> 00:00:48.915 align:start position:0% line:91%
WRONGS BORNE DISPROPORTIONATELY
BY AFRICAN AMERICANS.

00:00:48.948 --> 00:00:52.885 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT ON FOX-- YOU'RE GOING TO
LOVE THIS-- DESPITE THEIR

00:00:52.918 --> 00:00:56.255 align:start position:0% line:91%
24-HOUR SCHEDULE, THEY REALLY
ONLY HAD TIME FOR THE ONE

00:00:56.288 --> 00:00:57.389 align:start position:0% line:85%
REPORT.

00:00:57.423 --> 00:01:03.329 size:88% position:44% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THE D.O.J. NOW ADMITTING
HANDS UP, DON'T SHOOT, NEVER

00:01:03.362 --> 00:01:04.130 align:start position:0% line:85%
HAPPENED.

00:01:04.163 --> 00:01:05.264 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; PEOPLE HAVE BEEN FED A
NARRATIVE.

00:01:05.298 --> 00:01:08.401 size:84% position:42% line:91%
&gt;&gt; PROTESTERS WHO HAVE BEEN
RUNNING AROUND THIS COUNTRY

00:01:08.434 --> 00:01:09.369 align:start position:0% line:85%
TELLING A LIE.

00:01:09.402 --> 00:01:15.308 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THE TSUNAMI OF MISINFORMATION
AND INNUENDO.

00:01:15.341 --> 00:01:15.908 align:start position:0% line:91%
BONE-HEADED NONFACT-BASED
RHETORIC

00:01:15.941 --> 00:01:16.909 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; IT NEVER HAPPENED.

00:01:16.942 --> 00:01:18.010 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; DID NOT HAPPEN.

00:01:18.043 --> 00:01:20.713 line:85%
&gt;&gt; IT DID NOT HAPPEN THAT WAY.

00:01:20.746 --> 00:01:22.315 size:84% position:42% line:85%
WILSON HAS BEEN EXONERATED.

00:01:22.348 --> 00:01:23.282 align:start position:0% line:85%
LET'S MOVE ON.

00:01:23.315 --> 00:01:25.718 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon:  LET'S MOVE ON!

00:01:25.751 --> 00:01:28.421 line:91%
THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE FOUND
THAT THE FLASHPOINT INCIDENT FOR

00:01:28.454 --> 00:01:31.023 align:start position:0% line:91%
PROTESTS DID NOT HAPPEN THE WAY
SOME THOUGHT.

00:01:31.056 --> 00:01:34.660 line:91%
ALTHOUGH, IN THE SECOND REPORT,
THEY DID ALSO DOCUMENT A TOWER

00:01:34.693 --> 00:01:40.533 align:start position:0% line:91%
OF RACIALLY BASED KINDLING WOOD,
YEARS OF UNREASONABLE FORCE

00:01:40.566 --> 00:01:45.204 align:start position:0% line:91%
LIGHTER FLUID, AND DAILY TOSSED
LIT CIGARETTE BUTTS OF

00:01:45.237 --> 00:01:48.608 align:start position:0% line:91%
DISCRIMINATION AND HARASSMENT
THAT COULD EASILY LEND ITSELF TO

00:01:48.641 --> 00:01:50.176 align:start position:0% line:85%
THE FLASHPOINT.

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:58.284 line:91%
BUT AS THE FIRE SAFETY WARDENS
OF FOX SUGGEST, ( BLEEP ) IT,

00:01:58.317 --> 00:01:59.218 align:start position:0% line:85%
LET'S JUST MOVE ON.

00:01:59.252 --> 00:02:02.321 align:start position:0% line:91%
( LAUGHTER )
BUT HERE'S THE THING-- THE ANGER

00:02:02.354 --> 00:02:05.324 align:start position:0% line:85%
IS STILL THERE.

00:02:05.357 --> 00:02:10.296 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE PEOPLE COULDN'T MOVE ON AT
FOX.

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:13.566 align:start position:0% line:91%
THEY-- THEY DEMANDED RESTITUTION
AT FOX.

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:17.036 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WHY ISN'T THE MEDIA, WHICH
PEDALED THAT NARRATIVE,

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:18.270 align:start position:0% line:85%
APOLOGIZING?

00:02:18.304 --> 00:02:21.607 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; OBAMA, SHARPTON-- THEY SHOULD
BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.142 align:start position:0% line:85%
INCENDIARY RHETORIC.

00:02:23.175 --> 00:02:26.646 align:start size:97% position:3% line:91%
&gt;&gt; FANNING THE FLAMES, RUSHING
TO JUDGMENT.

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:27.814 size:75% position:38% line:85%
&gt;&gt; BLOOD ON THEIR HANDS.

00:02:27.847 --> 00:02:29.048 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THE DAMAGE WAS DONE. THE
INFLAMATORY RHETORIC WAS USED.

00:02:29.082 --> 00:02:32.718 line:91%
&gt;&gt; WE SAW MEMBERS OF CONGRESS
SAYING, "HAND UP, DON'T SHOOT."

00:02:32.751 --> 00:02:34.987 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND IF ONE OF THEM HAS SO FAR
APOLOGIZED FOR MISLEADING

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.792 line:85%
AMERICA, WE HAVEN'T HEARD IT.

00:02:39.825 --> 00:02:45.464 line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon:  I HAVE NOT RECEIVED
A SINGLE "I'M BEAR-Y SORRY FOR

00:02:45.497 --> 00:02:47.733 align:start position:0% line:91%
IGNITING RACIAL CONFLICTS"
GREETING CARDS.

00:02:47.766 --> 00:02:50.269 align:start position:0% line:85%
I HAVEN'T SEEN ONE!

00:02:50.302 --> 00:02:55.474 line:91%
THE LESSON FOX NEWS IS GETTING
AT IS VERY CLEAR-- WOULDN'T IT

00:02:55.507 --> 00:03:02.281 line:91%
BE NICE IF PEOPLE WHO JUMPED TO
CONCLUSIONS AND PEDALED A FALSE

00:03:02.314 --> 00:03:05.751 align:start position:0% line:91%
DIVISIVE, ANGER-STOKING
NARRATIVE HAD TO APOLOGIZE FOR

00:03:05.784 --> 00:03:06.519 align:start position:0% line:85%
MISLEADING AMERICA?

00:03:06.552 --> 00:03:08.654 align:start position:0% line:91%
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )

00:03:08.687 --> 00:03:19.732 align:start position:0% line:91%
NOW, NOW HERE'S WHERE THE
( BLEEP ) GETS REAL.

00:03:19.765 --> 00:03:24.537 align:start position:0% line:91%
I WONDER IF THERE'S AN ANALOGOUS
EVENT WHERE WE COULD

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.038 size:78% position:39% line:91%
TEST FOX'S FEALTY TO THIS
PRINCIPLE OF RESTITUTION 

00:03:26.071 --> 00:03:29.942 align:start position:0% line:85%
FOR AGGRIEVEMENT?

00:03:29.975 --> 00:03:31.510 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; DOES THE WORD BENGHAZI RING A
BELL?

00:03:31.543 --> 00:03:34.013 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; A BUNCH OF NEW QUESTIONS
ABOUT BENGHAZI.

00:03:34.046 --> 00:03:34.413 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; BENGHAZI.

00:03:34.446 --> 00:03:35.281 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; BENGHAZI.

00:03:35.314 --> 00:03:37.817 line:85%
&gt;&gt; BENGHAZI, BENGHAZI, BENGHAZI.

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:42.755 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon:  FIRST OF ALL,
BENGHAZI ISN'T "BEATLEJUICE."

00:03:42.788 --> 00:03:43.990 line:85%
YOU DON'T SAY IT THREE TIMES.

00:03:44.023 --> 00:03:46.025 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT IF YOU INSIST, OKAY, LET'S
USE THAT EXAMPLE.

00:03:46.058 --> 00:03:49.996 align:start position:0% line:91%
IT'S A TRAGIC EVENT WHERE
AMERICANS DIED, LIKE FERGUSON.

00:03:50.029 --> 00:03:54.267 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT IF THE ANALOGY IS TO HOLD,
WHO WILL PLAY THE ROLE OF

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:58.170 align:start position:0% line:91%
NATION-DIVIDING, ANGER-STOKING,
RHETORITICIAN BEFORE THE

00:03:58.203 --> 00:04:00.606 align:start position:0% line:91%
OFFICIAL GOVERNMENT
INVESTIGATION WAS COMPLETED?

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:06.445 line:91%
&gt;&gt; SPECIAL REPORT INVESTIGATES
DEATH AND DECEIT IN BENGHAZI.

00:04:06.478 --> 00:04:09.415 line:91%
&gt;&gt; SUSAN RICE WILLINGLY WENT
ALONG AND LIED ON SUNDAY CHAT

00:04:09.448 --> 00:04:10.649 align:start position:0% line:85%
SHOWS.

00:04:10.683 --> 00:04:14.020 line:91%
&gt;&gt; THE C.I.A. WARNED THAT THERE
MIGHT BE AN ATTACK ON THE 9/11

00:04:14.053 --> 00:04:15.088 align:start position:0% line:85%
ANNIVERSARY.

00:04:15.121 --> 00:04:17.556 size:81% position:41% line:91%
&gt;&gt; DURING THE ATTACK, THEY
DIDN'T SEND HELP THAT WAS

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:21.027 align:start position:0% line:91%
WAITING IN TRIPOLI, C-130, TO
ASSIST THESE GUYS.

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.130 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; COMING UP, THEY COULD HAVE
SAVED FOUR AMERICANS, BUT

00:04:24.163 --> 00:04:28.267 align:start position:0% line:91%
INSTEAD, OUR GOVERNMENT TOLD
THEM TO STAND DOWN.

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.170 size:88% position:44% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon:  SO BASICALLY YOU'RE
SAYING THE GOVERNMENT OF THE

00:04:31.203 --> 00:04:34.840 align:start position:0% line:91%
UNITED STATES TOLD ITS
MILITARY-- IF I WANT TO PUT THIS

00:04:34.873 --> 00:04:39.578 line:91%
IN A CATCHY, PROTESTY KIND OF
PHRASE-- STAND DOWN, DON'T

00:04:39.611 --> 00:04:40.779 align:start position:0% line:85%
SHOOT.

00:04:40.812 --> 00:04:42.915 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND FOX DIDN'T RESTRICT ITS
ANGER STOKING TO WORDS, BECAUSE

00:04:42.948 --> 00:04:46.352 line:91%
LET'S FACE IT, THEIR OLDER
VIEWERS WHO ARE HEARD OF

00:04:46.385 --> 00:04:50.056 align:start position:0% line:91%
HEARING, ALSO HAVE A RIGHT TO BE
MAD, SO SCARY OPENS AND

00:04:50.089 --> 00:04:54.960 align:start position:0% line:91%
THAT BURNING BENGHAZI FOOTAGE IN
A SEMICONTINUOUS LOOP

00:04:54.993 --> 00:04:55.894 align:start position:0% line:91%
LIKE SOME KIND OF
FOX NEWS YULE LOG.

00:04:55.928 --> 00:04:59.332 align:start position:0% line:91%
( LAUGHTER )
OH, THEY'RE RUNNING THE BURNING

00:04:59.365 --> 00:05:01.834 align:start position:0% line:85%
COMPOUND FOOTAGE AGAIN.

00:05:01.867 --> 00:05:06.739 line:91%
IT SEEMS LIKE BENGHAZ-MAS COMES
EARLIER AND EARLIER EVERY YEAR.

00:05:06.772 --> 00:05:11.544 line:91%
BUT, OF COURSE, UNLIKE FERGUSON
PROTESTERS, FOX WASN'T BEING

00:05:11.577 --> 00:05:12.745 size:84% position:42% line:85%
IRRESPONSIBLE AND DIVISIVE.

00:05:12.778 --> 00:05:14.547 size:84% position:42% line:85%
THEY JUST WANTED THE TRUTH.

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.050 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WE HAVE UNANSWERED QUESTIONS
ABOUT BENGHAZI.

00:05:18.083 --> 00:05:20.353 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THERE ARE GLARING QUESTIONS
THAT ARE UNANSWERED.

00:05:20.386 --> 00:05:22.655 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; QUESTIONS STILL REMAIN
UNANSWERED.

00:05:22.688 --> 00:05:26.092 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THERE ARE QUESTIONS ABOUT
STAND DOWN ORDERS AND SO ON, AND

00:05:26.125 --> 00:05:29.095 align:start position:0% line:91%
HERE WE ARE ALL THE TIME LATER,
WE DON'T HAVE THE ANSWERS.

00:05:29.128 --> 00:05:30.730 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; SO WE STILL DON'T HAVE THE
ANSWERS.

00:05:30.763 --> 00:05:33.966 line:91%
&gt;&gt; FOUR AMERICANS ARE DEAD, AND
THERE ARE A LOT OF UNANSWERRED

00:05:33.999 --> 00:05:35.167 align:start position:0% line:85%
QUESTIONS.

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.304 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: WELL, YOUR SENTENCE
CONSTRUCTION SAYS I JUST WANT TO

00:05:38.337 --> 00:05:41.607 align:start position:0% line:91%
KNOW BUT YOUR TONE SAYS WHY THE
PRESIDENT HAD AN AMBASSADOR

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:42.775 align:start position:0% line:85%
WHACKED.

00:05:42.808 --> 00:05:47.079 line:91%
WELL, FINALLY ON NOVEMBER 21,
2014, THEY GOT THEIR ANSWERS

00:05:47.112 --> 00:05:51.784 line:91%
FROM AN EXHAUSTIVE REPORT FROM
THE REPUBLICAN-CONTROLLED HOUSE

00:05:51.817 --> 00:05:55.755 align:start position:0% line:91%
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE ANSWERING
THOSE MANY QUESTIONS-- DID

00:05:55.788 --> 00:05:58.724 align:start size:97% position:3% line:91%
SUSAN RICE GO ON TV AND TRY TO
DECEIVE ANYONE?

00:05:58.757 --> 00:05:59.892 align:start position:0% line:85%
REPORT SAYS NO.

00:05:59.925 --> 00:06:00.893 line:91%
DID THE ADMINISTRATION IGNORE
CREDIBLE WARNINGS ABOUT THAT

00:06:00.926 --> 00:06:01.761 align:start position:0% line:85%
DAY'S ATTACK?

00:06:01.794 --> 00:06:02.895 align:start position:0% line:85%
REPORT SAYS NO.

00:06:02.929 --> 00:06:08.901 align:start position:0% line:91%
WAS THERE A STAND-DOWN ORDER OR
FAILURE TO RESCUE THOSE

00:06:08.934 --> 00:06:11.404 align:start position:0% line:91%
INDIVIDUALS AND SEND RESCUE
PLANES?

00:06:11.437 --> 00:06:12.672 align:start position:0% line:85%
REPORT SAYS NO.

00:06:12.705 --> 00:06:13.906 line:91%
WAS THERE A MASSIVE INTELLIGENCE
AGENCY COVER UP, THE REPORT SAYS

00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:16.876 align:start position:0% line:91%
NO, NOT C.I.A., NOT F.B.I., NONE
OF THEM.

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:18.411 align:start size:97% position:3% line:91%
WHICH MEANS ALL THESE ELEMENTS
OF THE TWO YEAR BENGHAZI

00:06:18.444 --> 00:06:23.516 align:start position:0% line:91%
RAGE-GASM -- WERE, WHAT
DO YOU, WHAT DO YOU CALL IT?

00:06:23.549 --> 00:06:25.217 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; TSUNAMI OF MISINFORMATION AN
INNUENDO.

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:26.852 size:88% position:44% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon: RIGHT, RIGHT. RIGHT.

00:06:26.885 --> 00:06:29.655 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; BONE-HEADED, NON-FACTED-BASED
RHETORIC.

00:06:29.688 --> 00:06:30.356 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon:  YES! YES, YES, YES!
THAT! 

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:32.858 align:start position:0% line:91%
RIGHT, IT'S ALL THOSE
THINGS.

00:06:32.891 --> 00:06:35.728 line:91%
SO IT WOULD ONLY FOLLOW THAT
JUST LIKE FOX DEMANDED OF ANY

00:06:35.761 --> 00:06:39.665 line:91%
PROTESTER WHO SAID, "HANDS UP,
DON'T SHOOT," THE CORRECTION

00:06:39.698 --> 00:06:40.900 align:start position:0% line:91%
ACTION FOR NO STAND DOWN DON'T
SHOOT FOR FOX NEWS NOW

00:06:40.933 --> 00:06:44.937 align:start position:0% line:85%
WOULD BE TO--

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:51.243 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WHY ISN'T THE MEDIA WHICH
PEDALED THAT NARRATIVE

00:06:51.276 --> 00:06:51.643 align:start position:0% line:85%
APOLOGIZING?

00:06:51.677 --> 00:06:52.445 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon:  YES!

00:06:52.478 --> 00:06:52.745 align:start position:0% line:85%
YES!

00:06:52.779 --> 00:06:54.213 align:start position:0% line:85%
WHY NOT?

00:07:17.936 --> 00:07:20.673 align:start position:0% line:91%
IN FACT, OTHER THAN A COUPLE OF
HALF-HEARTED EFFORTS TO

00:07:20.706 --> 00:07:23.776 align:start position:0% line:91%
( BLEEP ) ON THE REPUBLICAN-LED

00:07:23.809 --> 00:07:26.812 size:78% position:39% line:85%
LARGELY UNNOTICED ON FOX.

FOR ANSWERS HAD THE HOUSE
COMMITTEE CHAIR MIKE ROGERS ON

00:07:34.853 --> 00:07:37.590 align:start position:0% line:91%
HER SHOW TWO WEEKS AFTER HE
RELEASED THE BENGHAZI REPORT AND

00:07:37.623 --> 00:07:41.360 align:start position:0% line:91%
NEVER ASKED HIM ABOUT IT ONCE,
NOT ( BLEEP ) ONCE.

00:07:41.393 --> 00:07:45.331 line:91%
YES, THE NETWORK, WHO USED THE
WORD "BENGHAZI" LIKE A CLUBHOUSE

00:07:45.364 --> 00:07:48.367 align:start position:0% line:91%
PASSWORD, THE OFFICIAL
REPUBLICAN-DOMINATED HOUSE

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:51.103 line:91%
REPORT ON BENGHAZI WAS THE ONLY
NEWS STORY IN TWO YEARS THAT

00:07:51.136 --> 00:07:53.472 align:start position:0% line:91%
DIDN'T REMIND THEM TO TALK ABOUT
BENGHAZI.

00:07:53.505 --> 00:08:00.112 align:start position:0% line:91%
( LAUGHTER )
WHICH BRINGS US, ONCE AGAIN, TO

00:08:00.145 --> 00:08:04.116 align:start position:0% line:91%
OUR MAIN POINT OF RESPECT AND
APPRECIATION.

00:08:04.149 --> 00:08:09.288 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE BEAUTY THAT IS THE UGLINESS
OF FOX NEWS.

00:08:09.321 --> 00:08:13.659 align:start position:0% line:91%
THEY DEMAND ACCOUNTABILITY FOR
ANGER DIVISIVENESS, WHILST

00:08:13.692 --> 00:08:16.962 line:91%
HOLDING THEMSELVES ENTIRELY
UNACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR ANGER

00:08:16.995 --> 00:08:18.731 align:start position:0% line:85%
AND DIVISIVENESS.

00:08:18.764 --> 00:08:21.767 size:84% position:42% line:91%
FOR TWO YEARS, THEY USED
BENGHAZI AS SHORTHAND, AS A

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:26.038 line:91%
SYMBOL FOR THE WHOLE CONCEPT OF
A CORRUPT, LYING, TYRANNICAL,

00:08:26.071 --> 00:08:31.377 line:91%
POSSIBLY MURDEROUS OBAMA WHITE
HOUSE, KIND OF LIKE OTHER PEOPLE

00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:38.717 align:start position:0% line:91%

SYMBOL FOR SYSTEMIC RACISM.

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:41.820 size:84% position:42% line:91%
AND THERE'S REALLY ONLY ONE
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO

00:08:41.853 --> 00:08:46.392 align:start position:0% line:91%
PHENOMENA-- SYSTEMIC RACISM
ACTUALLY EXISTS.

00:08:46.425 --> 00:08:55.434 align:start position:0% line:91%
