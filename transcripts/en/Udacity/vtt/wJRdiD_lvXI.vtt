00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:00.860
Well, let's see.

00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:03.190
The first thing I want to
do is find some points.

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:04.680
This time I think I will use 0, 0.

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.700
Though, I could have used some others.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:11.210
And then it looks like this
is a point as well, -1, 3.

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:16.590
So the rise appears to be -3 and
the run appears to be 1.

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:23.319
So the slope was just -3 / 1, or
we could have just written -3.
