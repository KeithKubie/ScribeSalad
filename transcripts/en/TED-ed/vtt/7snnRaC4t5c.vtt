00:00:07.093 --> 00:00:10.692
When French mathematician Laurent Schwartz
was in high school,

00:00:10.692 --> 00:00:14.912
he started to worry that he wasn't
smart enough to solve math problems.

00:00:14.912 --> 00:00:17.044
Maybe you know a similar feeling.

00:00:17.044 --> 00:00:18.973
You sit down to take a math test,

00:00:18.973 --> 00:00:21.133
and you feel your heart beat faster

00:00:21.133 --> 00:00:23.083
and your palms start to sweat.

00:00:23.083 --> 00:00:26.874
You get butterflies in your stomach,
and you can't concentrate.

00:00:26.874 --> 00:00:29.992
This phenomenon is called math anxiety,

00:00:29.992 --> 00:00:32.994
and if it happens to you,
you're not alone.

00:00:32.994 --> 00:00:37.333
Researchers think about 20% 
of the population suffers from it.

00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:42.474
Some psychologists even consider it
a diagnosable condition.

00:00:42.474 --> 00:00:47.184
But having mathematical anxiety doesn't
necessarily mean you're bad at math -

00:00:47.184 --> 00:00:48.704
not even close.

00:00:48.704 --> 00:00:51.453
Laurent Schwartz went on to win
the Fields Medal,

00:00:51.453 --> 00:00:53.783
the highest award in mathematics.

00:00:53.783 --> 00:00:57.644
People might think that they're anxious
about math because they're bad at it,

00:00:57.644 --> 00:00:59.755
but it's often the other way around.

00:00:59.755 --> 00:01:03.344
They're doing poorly in math
because they're anxious about it.

00:01:03.344 --> 00:01:05.275
Some psychologists think that's because

00:01:05.275 --> 00:01:08.094
math anxiety decreases 
a cognitive resource

00:01:08.094 --> 00:01:09.550
called working memory.

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:11.274
That's the short-term memory system

00:01:11.274 --> 00:01:15.736
that helps you organize the information 
you need to complete a task.

00:01:15.736 --> 00:01:18.115
Worrying about being able to solve
math problems,

00:01:18.115 --> 00:01:20.204
or not doing well on a test,

00:01:20.204 --> 00:01:21.965
eats up working memory,

00:01:21.965 --> 00:01:25.124
leaving less of it available to tackle
the math itself.

00:01:25.124 --> 00:01:28.005
People can suddenly struggle
with even basic math skills,

00:01:28.005 --> 00:01:31.626
like arithmetic, 
that they've otherwise mastered.

00:01:31.626 --> 00:01:35.295
Academic anxiety certainly
isn't limited to math,

00:01:35.295 --> 00:01:37.745
but it does seem to happen much
more frequently,

00:01:37.745 --> 00:01:40.785
and cause more harm
in that subject.

00:01:40.785 --> 00:01:42.795
So why would that be?

00:01:42.795 --> 00:01:44.834
Researchers aren't yet sure,

00:01:44.834 --> 00:01:46.125
but some studies suggest

00:01:46.125 --> 00:01:49.475
that the way children are exposed
to math by their parents and teachers

00:01:49.475 --> 00:01:51.255
play a large part.

00:01:51.255 --> 00:01:54.876
If parents talk about math like
something challenging and unfamiliar,

00:01:54.876 --> 00:01:57.266
children can internalize that.

00:01:57.266 --> 00:02:01.846
Teachers with math anxiety are also
likely to spread it to their students.

00:02:01.846 --> 00:02:05.736
Pressure to solve problems quickly
dials up stress even more.

00:02:05.736 --> 00:02:11.296
And in some cultures, being good
at math is a sign of being smart in general.

00:02:11.296 --> 00:02:13.107
When the stakes are that high,

00:02:13.107 --> 00:02:15.667
it's not surprising 
that students are anxious.

00:02:15.667 --> 00:02:19.187
Even Maryam Mirzakhani, 
an influential mathematician

00:02:19.187 --> 00:02:21.796
who was the first woman to win
the Fields Medal,

00:02:21.796 --> 00:02:24.956
felt unconfident and lost interest
in mathematics

00:02:24.956 --> 00:02:28.747
because her math teacher in middle school
didn't think she was talented.

00:02:28.747 --> 00:02:30.937
So if you experience mathematical anxiety,

00:02:30.937 --> 00:02:32.837
what can you do?

00:02:32.837 --> 00:02:35.947
Relaxation techniques, 
like short breathing exercises,

00:02:35.947 --> 00:02:39.926
have improved test performance
in students with math anxiety.

00:02:39.926 --> 00:02:42.187
Writing down your worries can also help.

00:02:42.187 --> 00:02:46.058
This strategy may give you a chance
to reevaluate a stressful experience,

00:02:46.058 --> 00:02:48.247
freeing up working memory.

00:02:48.247 --> 00:02:49.607
And if you have the chance,

00:02:49.607 --> 00:02:52.957
physical activity, like a brisk walk,
deepens breathing

00:02:52.957 --> 00:02:54.927
and helps relieve muscle tension,

00:02:54.927 --> 00:02:57.415
preventing anxiety from building.

00:02:57.415 --> 00:02:59.697
You can also use your knowledge
about the brain

00:02:59.697 --> 00:03:01.660
to change your mindset.

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:02.986
The brain is flexible,

00:03:02.986 --> 00:03:07.167
and the areas involved in math skills 
can always grow and develop.

00:03:07.167 --> 00:03:11.327
This is a psychological principle
called the growth mindset.

00:03:11.327 --> 00:03:14.217
Thinking of yourself as someone
who can grow and improve

00:03:14.217 --> 00:03:17.737
can actually help you grow and improve.

00:03:17.741 --> 00:03:20.120
If you're a teacher 
or parent of young children,

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.260
try being playful with math
and focusing on the creative aspects.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:25.970
That can build the numerical skills

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.581
that help students approach math 
with confidence later on.

00:03:29.581 --> 00:03:32.480
Importantly, you should give children
the time and space

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.782
to work through their answers.

00:03:34.782 --> 00:03:36.291
And if you're an administrator,

00:03:36.291 --> 00:03:39.481
make sure your teachers 
have the positive attitudes

00:03:39.481 --> 00:03:41.289
and mathematical confidence necessary

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:44.659
to inspire confidence 
in all of their students.

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:46.589
Also, don't let anyone spread the myth

00:03:46.589 --> 00:03:49.450
that boys are innately 
better than girls at math.

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.510
That is completely false.

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.109
If you experience math anxiety,

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:57.059
it may not help to just know 
that math anxiety exists.

00:03:57.059 --> 00:04:00.599
Or perhaps it's reassuring to put
a name to the problem.

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:03.239
Regardless, if you take a look
around yourself,

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:07.410
the odds are good that you'll see someone 
experiencing the same thing as you.

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:11.593
Just remember that the anxiety is not
a reflection of your ability,

00:04:11.593 --> 00:04:15.409
but it is something you can conquer 
with time and awareness.
