This episode of DNews is brought to you by
HARRY’S

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:07.190
When you hear the word "detox" or "cleanse"
do you get irrationally angry?

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:08.910
Well c'mon get happy!

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:19.520
Let's break this down like the digestive system!

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.990
Detoxes tell us on our diet is filled with
"toxins" and "chemicals," that need to be

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.990
cleaned out.

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.090
Their solution is to eat raw things, or only
drink juice, or whatever…

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.280
Detoxing is a huge industry that has been
completely debunked by medical science, but

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.620
that doesn't stop us doing it.

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.000
If you are a drug addict, medical science
can help clear your system with a detox, but

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.899
if not -- buying dime-store online direct-to-consumer
health fad detox is not going to do anything

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:47.899
helpful.

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:51.140
Pills and potions to improve the body have
been sold for centuries; and every time science

00:00:51.140 --> 00:01:00.920
looks into it, it's obvious they're selling
snake oil.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.430
The human body is an incredible thing -- it
can take in any number of edible, drinkable

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.820
and breathable things which are low-level
poisons, and process them.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.460
You're probably thinking sugar! alcohol! fast
food!

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.890
But, oxygen, salt, and water are poisons!

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.740
In high enough quantities, each of those can
kill.

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.280
It's all in the dosage.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.690
Everything in moderation, is a great way to
look at it.

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.659
For example, alcohol got its moniker as a
poison from the Women's Christian Temperance

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:32.080
Union, The Anti-Saloon League and the KKK[1]
to get people to stop consuming.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:38.229
Sure, in massive quantities alcohol will poison
us, but so will salt or oxygen!

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:43.020
Plus, popular "detox" foods like tomatoes
and broccoli contain cyanide!

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.630
And drinking nothing but fructose -- the sugar
which makes fruit juice sweet -- does not

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.010
go over well in humans.

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.740
In reality, the human body comes with structures
designed specifically to clean and filter

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.970
the blood and digestive systems -- the liver
and the kidneys[2].

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.790
They do a great job keeping us clean.

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:05.570
When we consume anything, the kidneys and
liver filter out any "toxins" and send them

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.869
out of the body as waste.

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:09.280
*hands* done.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.560
A "detox diet" doesn't help the kidneys do
this job any better.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.810
According to the Guardian[3] and Harvard Medical
School[4], detox kits are often designed to

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.470
make you FEEL like you're getting something
for your money, even if you're not.

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:30.730
For example, there are no little bits of poop
stuck in your colon that need to be cleansed,

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.451
but some colon-cleansing tablets claim to
have a polymerising agent that makes your

00:02:34.451 --> 00:02:39.800
poop stick together in a single piece; so
you can then admire it and feel accomplished--

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:45.239
actually, that sounds pretty awesome.

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.099
BUT IT'S NOT HEALTHIER.

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:51.400
Even though the detoxing itself isn't doing
anything helpful, the act often has people

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.680
reporting they feel healthier or have more
energy, or even have weight loss!

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.580
All these things are possible, some might
be a placebo…

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.720
But in the end, it could also be down to the
highly restrictive forms of many of these

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:04.720
diets.

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.640
Intermittent fasting has shown some benefits[5]…
and if you're restricting nutrients you're

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:09.769
essentially fasting.

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:14.080
During a fast, your metabolism drops, and
your body puts more resources into your brain

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.400
power to help you find food.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:24.700
In modern society that means more energy flow
for your neurons[6]!

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.519
The reason people keep doing it is a mystery,
maybe it's because we want to believe we have

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:32.959
control over our bodies, or because we feel
like we have to make up for eating badly,

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:38.180
or because we hear about pollution and toxins
in our environment[7], or because taking a

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.150
pill seems easier than exercise… or something
else…

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:42.150
Who knows.

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.370
The best way to "detox" your body, is not
to drink only juice for a week, that's for

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.069
SURE; but rather to eat healthily, exercise
outside.

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:53.090
We couldn't have made this episode of DNews
without support from Harry's.

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.790

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:19.159
Do you have friends who "cleanse" what do
you tell them?

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:21.430
Did you do one?

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:36.829
Do you care about the science?!
