# Videos for Free on iTunes!

00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:02.140
(And Changes at Patreon)

00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:03.140
Hello Internet,

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:04.899
Starting today I'm making my videos available
on iTunes for free.

00:00:04.899 --> 00:00:09.600
If you click this link you can get them automatically
downloaded to your phone or tablet or computer.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.390
-- and yes, before a thousand people in the
comments ask, there is an RSS feed for nerds

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:15.870
that you can plug into anything.

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.779
I'd love for you to click on the screen and
to give this a try because it's something

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:22.089
I've always wanted to make available.

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:27.020
Partly because it's convenient for you and
also because having YouTube as the only place

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.180
the videos live is a little scary.

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:30.460
Particularly lately.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:35.239
So this is a safe place for the videos where
I pay to host the files so YouTube doesn't

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:37.210
have any control over them..

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:38.210
That's a big deal.

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.329
Now I'm able to make this for free for you
partly because some of the videos are going

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.090
to have a sponsor at the end.

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.929
I'm telling you this *before* the next video
because the other big reason I'm able to try

00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:52.260
this out is your direct support on Patreon.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.690
It's these two things that allow the videos
to exist independently from YouTube for the

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.809
first time without, from a professional creator
perspective, shooting

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:01.039
myself in the foot.

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:05.700
But I'm also concerned that some of you, my
dear crowd-funders, might not want to support

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.829
videos that are also sponsored.

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:09.100
If that's you, no worries.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.290
We're cool -- that's precisely the reason
I made what you're watching right now: to

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.070
let you know in advance.

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.600
And of course, whenever I mention the crowd-funding,
I always want to make it super clear there

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.780
are lots of people who *shouldn't* -- I'm
looking at you in students in particular,

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:23.780
and etc.

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.939
For everyone else the crowd-funding should
feel a lot like sending Internet coffee because

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:29.579
you like the things I make.

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:30.930
And I like coffee.

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:31.930
It's not an obligation.

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.810
The crowd-funding does, however, allow me
to make video decisions based on interestingness

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.790
and now convenience and not just popularity.

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.280
And it also allows me to turn off kinds of
ads that I think are too intrusive like the

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.430
pop-up ads which I hate and I know you do
too.

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.840
OK, if you are still on-board, there are some
new perks over at Patreon -- I've expanded

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.369
the Wallpaper pack to include new VOTE ANIMAL
and other wallpapers, there's a wall-of-thanks

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:59.649
on my website, and a special perk for spoiler-loving
grammar Nazis.

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:00.700
You know who you are.

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.979
So that's the bottom line today: Crowdfunding
+ Sponsors = CGP Grey videos on iTunes and

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:07.130
RSS.

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.220
Click here to try it out and let me know what
you think.

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.590
I'm really curious to hear how this works
for you

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:27.810
### Post credits.

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.761
Obviously don't tell me what you think in
the YouTube comments, which are useless, Tell

00:02:31.761 --> 00:02:38.150
me on Reddit -- where I can actually, you
know, *follow the conversation*.
