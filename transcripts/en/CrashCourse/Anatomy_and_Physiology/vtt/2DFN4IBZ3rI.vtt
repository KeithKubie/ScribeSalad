00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
What’s true in World of Warcraft is also
true in your immune system:

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.009
To defeat your enemy, you have to know your
enemy.

00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:09.430
Uncover its weaknesses. Learn how to see it,
before it sees you.

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:13.670
We’ve already talked about how your innate
defense system keeps out, or quietly neutralizes,

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:17.300
pathogens without much too much fuss. But
sooner or later, a threat’s gonna come along

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.250
that’s stronger than what the first-responders
can handle. That’s when it’s time for

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.250
the adaptive, or acquired immune system to
step in.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.660
While your innate system takes its zero-tolerance
policy very seriously, and tries to toast

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.800
any foreign microbe that it encounters, your
adaptive system does things differently.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:38.980
It has to be expressly introduced to a specific pathogen,
and recognize it as a threat, before it will attack.

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:43.109
As its name suggests, you’re not born with
a working adaptive immune system -- it’s

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:47.149
slow to act, in part because it takes time
for it to shake hands with so many pathogens

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:48.420
and get to know them.

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:51.579
These introductions may be organic -- like
touching a dirty faucet in the bathroom or

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:53.489
walking into a sneeze cloud.

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.269
Or they may be premeditated, which is why
vaccination is pretty much the greatest thing

00:00:57.269 --> 00:00:58.809
to happen to medicine ever.

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:02.780
But once it’s been introduced to a potential
threat, your adaptive defenses never forget

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.689
it. And this ability to remember specific
pathogens is one of the key differences between

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.840
the adaptive and innate defenses.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.869
Another main difference is that adaptive immunity
is systemic -- rather than being restricted

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.429
to a particular infection in, say, a sinus
or a sliced finger, your adaptive system can

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:19.460
fight throughout your whole body at once.

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.779
And it does this by deploying one or both
of its separate, but cooperating, defenses

00:01:23.779 --> 00:01:26.740
-- your humoral immunity and your cellular
defenses.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.439
Your humoral immunity -- which you might not
have heard of before -- works by dispatching

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:33.570
important proteins that I’m sure you have
heard of: antibodies.

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.539
They’re made by special white blood cells,
and they patrol the body’s “humors”

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:41.729
or fluids like blood and lymph, where they
combat viruses and bacteria moving around

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.869
the interstitial space between your cells.

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:48.009
Much of what you know, or have heard about,
or think of, when your immune system comes

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:50.450
up actually has to do with your humoral immunity.

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.310
It’s why, if you had mumps as a kid, you
probably don’t have to worry about getting

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.760
it again for the rest of your life.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.580
It’s also why doctors and nurses and patients
who have been infected with the ebola virus

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.960
-- a disease once thought to be incurable
-- have lived to tell about it.

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.560
And it’s why vaccinations work.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.540
Whether you’re protecting yourself from
infections or playing an MMO, one of the first

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:23.030
steps in any good defensive strategy is to
be able to tell your friend from your foe.

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.190
And in the case of your immune system, that
means being able to identify antigens.

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.310
An antigen could be an invader from the outside
world, like a bacterium, virus, or fungus.

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.860
Or it could be a toxin or a diseased cell
within your own body.

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.080
But in any case, antigens are large signalling
molecules not normally found in the body,

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.040
and they act as flags that get the adaptive
immune system riled up.

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.810
So let’s say a flu virus gets inside of
you, and it’s floating around trying to

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.400
find a good host cell to start multiplying
inside of.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.100
Before it finds that cell, hopefully it will
be paid a visit by one of the stars of your

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.560
humoral response -- a B lymphocyte.

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.920
Like all blood cells, these guys originate
in your bone marrow. But unlike other white

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.760
blood cells, they also mature in the bone
marrow too.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.400
And as a B cell matures, it develops the ability
to determine friend from foe, developing both

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.420
immunocompetence -- or how to recognize and
bind to a particular antigen -- as well as

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.300
self-tolerance, or knowing how to NOT attack
your body’s own cells.

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.210
Once it’s fully mature, a B lymphocyte displays
at least 10,000 special protein receptors

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:21.780
on its surface -- these are its membrane-bound
antibodies.

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.510
All B lymphocytes have them, but the cool
thing is, every individual lymphocyte has

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.620
its own unique antibodies, each of which is ready
to identify and bind to a particular kind of antigen.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.700
That means that, with all of your B lymphocytes
together, it’s like having 2 billion keys

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:38.900
on your immune system’s keychain, each of
which can only open one door.

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.820
So, part of your immune system’s strategy
is just to win with overwhelming odds: The

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:47.570
more unique antibodies your lymphocytes have,
the more likely it is that one will eventually

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:50.250
find, bind to, and mark a particular antigen.

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.760
Once they’ve matured, B cells colonize or
“seed” your secondary lymphoid organs,

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:58.220
like your lymph nodes, and start roaming around
in your blood and lymph.

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:01.820
At this point they’re still naive and untested,
and they won’t truly be activated until

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:03.790
they meet their perfect enemy match.

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:05.540
Which brings us back to the flu virus.

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.880
When the right B cell finally bumps into an
antigen it has antibodies for -- usually in

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:14.330
a lymph node or in the spleen -- and recognizes
it, it binds to it. This summons the full

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:18.650
power of the humoral immune response, and
the cell basically goes into berserker mode.

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.850
Once activated, the B cell starts cloning
itself like crazy, quickly producing an army

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:27.650
of similar cells, all with the instructions
for the exact same antibodies that are designed

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.840
to fight that one particular antigen.

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.060
Most of these clones become active fighters,
or effector cells. But a few become long-lived

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.930
memory cells that preserve the genetic code
for that specific, successful antibody.

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:42.750
This ensures that, if and when the antigen
returns, there will be a prepared secondary

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.040
immune response that’s both stronger and
faster than the first.

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:50.800
This is key to why vaccinations are so brilliant
and important, which I’ll come back to in a minute.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.940
But while the memory cells are just there
to hang back and record things, the effector,

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:59.840
or plasma cells, are packed with extra amounts
of rough endoplasmic reticulum, which acts

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:01.240
as an antibody factory.

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.400
These cells can mass-produce the same antibodies
over and over for that particular invader,

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:10.040
spitting them out into the humor at a rate
of around 2,000 antibodies per second for

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.060
four or five days until they die.

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:16.320
And the antibodies they make work the same way that
the membrane-bound ones do; they’re just free-floating.

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:20.300
So they ride the tides of blood and lymph,
binding to all the antigens they can find,

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:22.180
and marking them for death.

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.410
Now, antibodies can’t really do the killing
themselves, but they do have a few moves that

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:27.560
could make it hard for intruders to take hold.

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.760
One of their most effective and common strategies
is neutralization, where antibodies physically

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:36.520
block the binding sites on viruses or bacterial
toxins, so they can’t hook up to your tissues.

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:40.770
And because antibodies have more than one
binding site, they can bind to multiple antigens

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:43.570
at the same time, in a process called agglutination.

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:47.170
The resulting clumps can’t get around easily,
which makes it easier for macrophages

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:48.530
to come and gobble them up.

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:52.139
And not only that, but while all this is going
on, antibodies are also ringing a chemical

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:56.460
dinner bell, calling in phagocytes from the
innate immune system, and special lymphocytes

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:00.870
from the adaptive system, to destroy these
messy little antigen-antibody clumps.

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:04.430
So, the point of all this in the short term
is to keep you healthy. But in the long term,

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.830
this process also adds to your overall immunity.

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:11.510
The humoral response allows your body to achieve
immunity by encountering pathogens either

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.400
randomly or on purpose.

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.610
Active humoral immunity is what we were just
talking about -- it’s when B cells bump

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:18.960
into antigens and start cranking out antibodies.

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:22.710
This can occur naturally, like when you catch
the flu or get chickenpox or pick up some

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:28.290
nasty bacterial infection, or it can happen
artificially -- particularly through vaccination.

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:32.290
Most vaccines are made of a dead or extremely
weakened pathogen. And they work on the premise

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:36.430
that, because a secondary immune response
is more intense than a primary response, by

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:41.120
introducing a pathogen into your body, you’re
priming it to fight hard and fast should that

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:42.450
antigen show up again.

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:46.060
In the case of typically non-fatal infections,
like the common flu, this immunity should

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:48.350
at least spare you from some of the most severe
symptoms.

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:52.900
But in the case of more serious diseases,
like polio, smallpox, measles, and whooping

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:55.130
cough, vaccinations can be truly life-saving.

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:58.280
Now, some antigens -- like those for mumps
or measles -- don’t really change much over

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:01.030
time, so a few immunizations will leave you
set for life.

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:05.210
But others, like influenza, are constantly
evolving and changing their surface antigens.

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:09.320
So immunity to last year’s flu probably
doesn’t work against this year’s flu.

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:11.760
Still, acquired immunity doesn’t have to
be active.

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:16.610
Babies, for example, naturally obtain passive
humoral immunity while still in the womb.

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:20.740
They receive readymade antibodies from their
mothers through the placenta, and later on

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:21.410
through breast milk.

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:25.070
And that works pretty well for a few months,
but the protection is temporary, because passively

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:29.040
obtained antibodies don’t live long in their
new body. And they can’t produce effector

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:33.940
cells or memory cells, so a baby’s own system
won’t remember an antigen if it gets infected again.

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:37.350
You can also acquire this kind of temporary
passive immunity artificially, by receiving

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:40.669
exogenous antibodies from the plasma of an
immune donor.

00:07:40.669 --> 00:07:44.560
This is what recently saved some doctors and
nurses who had contracted the ebola virus

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:45.790
from infected patients.

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:50.040
A serum was made from the blood plasma of
other medical workers who had been infected,

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:50.710
and survived.

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:54.060
The antibodies helped defend the patients
from the virus before their own active immunity

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:58.010
could identify that particular antigen and
start creating their own antibodies.

00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:02.000
It’s not the same as a vaccine, which immediately
engages your B cells, but it can buy a patient

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.449
some crucial, life-saving time against an
infection that would otherwise quickly kill.

00:08:06.449 --> 00:08:10.449
But B cells and antibodies are only part of
the immunity equation. There are plenty of

00:08:10.449 --> 00:08:14.830
pathogens that quickly worm their way right
inside your cells, where they’re safer from

00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:18.150
the humoral response and free to multiply
as much as they’d like.

00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:22.360
Luckily, your immune system has yet another
game plan and new set of players ready to

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:25.570
fight that final battle with cell to cell
combat.

00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:30.919
Make sure you catch our final episode next
week and learn all about this epic battle royale.

00:08:30.919 --> 00:08:35.479
But as for today, in our second-to-last episode,
you learned how the adaptive immune system’s

00:08:35.479 --> 00:08:39.829
humoral response guards your extracellular
terrain against pathogens. We looked at how

00:08:39.829 --> 00:08:45.540
B cells mature, identify antigens, and make
antibodies, and how antibodies swarm pathogens

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:50.029
and mark them for death. We also talked about
active and passive humoral immunity, and how

00:08:50.029 --> 00:08:51.139
vaccines work.
