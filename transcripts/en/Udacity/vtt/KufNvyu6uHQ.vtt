00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Well, we know the initial velocity is 5 m/s.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
We know the height, and that corresponds to a change in position.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
If we're going to drop this ball 57 m, it's going to change position from here to here,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
a distance of 57 m.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
We know Δx and, though I didn't tell you this explicitly, we know the acceleration.

00:00:15.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Acceleration is just going to be that number we labeled g or 10 m/s².
