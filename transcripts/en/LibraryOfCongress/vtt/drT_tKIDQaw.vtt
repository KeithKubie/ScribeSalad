00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:11.890
[ Applause ]

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:13.190
&gt;&gt; Karyn Temple: Good morning.

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:15.540
Welcome to our 20th
copyright matters event.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.990
I am Karen Temple,
Acting Director

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.050
of the United States
Copyright Office.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:21.490
Today we are excited

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:25.210
to be celebrating the
lifecycle of copyright.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.800
What do I mean by the
lifecycle of copyright?

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.830
Well generally, our friends at
Webster define the lifecycle

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.840
as "the series of stages
through which something,

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.080
such as an individual, culture

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.780
or manufactured product
passes during its lifetime."

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.950
While copyright, of course,
is not a living organism,

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.460
it too has a lifecycle
and passes

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.630
through many stages over time.

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:50.580
Starting from the
very beginning,

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:54.070
when it's not even a copyright
yet, but simply an idea

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.260
or thought that serves as
that seed for a later piece

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.760
of artwork, that then grows into
a fully formed copyrighted work,

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.160
such as a book, song,
photograph or painting.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.520
Over the course of its lifecycle

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.700
that copyrighted work may
spread far and wide on its own

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.820
as it adapts and
generates other works.

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.720
And finally, at the end of
its copyright lifecycle,

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.120
when the full copyright term of
protection has been achieved,

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.090
the copyright work returns
figuratively to the earth,

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.530
as it enters the public
domain and is free to use

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:30.830
and reuse by everyone.

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.110
I still find it amazing
and inspiring

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.940
that the founding
fathers were able

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.290
to appreciate the extraordinary
importance of copyright

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.590
and the copyright lifecycle
by enshrining it article one

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.740
of our constitution insuring
both strong copyright

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.790
protection, but also recognizing
the value of limited terms

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.420
and the public domain.

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.730
The full value and beauty

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.460
of our copyright system can
unfortunately sometimes be

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.560
forgotten and seen as
some sort of barrier

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.930
to creation and innovation.

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.680
When, in fact, it
is far from that.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.810
As the Supreme Court
has recognized,

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.940
copyright is the engine
of free expression.

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.730
And the lifecycle of copyright
including its exceptions,

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.310
limited term and the
public domain is all part

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.990
of that critically
important framework created

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:19.700
on our constitution.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.630
So today, we have the distinct
pleasure to celebrate part

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.230
of that lifecycle in a way

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.010
that we have not been
able to do for some time.

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.980
On January 1 of this year,
hundreds of works that had been

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.820
under copyright protection
entered into the public domain.

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.030
These were works that
had been created in 1923.

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.090
Many have been widely
recognizable

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.880
for almost 100 years, songs
such as the Charleston,

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.930
as you just heard and
yes we have No Bananas.

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.330
Films just as Harold
Lloyd's Safety Last.

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.870
Buster Keaton's, Our Hospitality

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.310
and Charlie Chaplan's
The Pilgrim.

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:01.680
Books, stories and essays by
the likes of PG - GK Chesterton,

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.070
Anton Chekov, Agatha
Christie, Aldous Huxley,

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.270
F. Scott Fitzgerald,
Rudyard Kipling,

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:12.330
Sinclair Lewis and
P.G. Woodhouse.

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:16.030
These works would have entered
the public domain in 1999,

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.470
but then following the
lead of the European Union

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.000
and to protect American
authors from inequity overseas,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.260
Congress extended
copyright protection

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.750
in the United States
by 20 years.

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.820
And so this year is the
first time in two decades

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:34.020
that a large batch of older
works has simultaneously fallen

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:37.720
into the public domain
at one time.

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.490
It is important to recognize

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:42.130
that when a work enters the
public domain of course,

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:45.940
it does not represent the death
of copyright; rather it is part

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.730
of copyright's lifecycle.

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.900
The next stage of life
for that creative work.

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.670
The public domain is an
inherent and integral part

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.240
of the copyright system.

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:58.010
So, when people say that
they value copyright law,

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:01.210
the public domain is a
crucial component of that.

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:05.270
In fact, throughout our history
artistic hits have been often

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:08.630
adaptations of classics that
were in the public domain

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:12.110
or new creations called
from public domain sources.

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:14.480
Hollywood films, Kiss Me Kate

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.460
and more recently 10 Things I
Hate About You are adaptations

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:20.880
of Shakespeare's
Taming of the Shrew.

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.650
The 2009 novel and movie
Pride and Prejudice

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:29.710
and Zombie's is an adaptation
of Jane Austen's classic novel

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:33.590
and Beyonce's Ave Maria is
an adaptation of Schubert's.

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.360
In fact, many popular
animated movies

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.600
and theater productions
are modern

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.880
and commercially
successful takes

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.340
on classic public
domain fairy tales.

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.960
Snow White and the Seven
Dwarfs, Cinderella,

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.820
Sleeping Beauty,
Beauty and the Beast.

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:54.430
This lifecycle of copyright is
crucial to the overall system.

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:58.160
It provides authors the
inspiration and raw material

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.460
to create something new.

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:04.630
And that is why it is valued
by both authors and users,

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.290
because often when it comes

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:08.820
to the public domain
authors are users

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:11.470
and users are authors
of copyrighted works.

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:14.420
And that's why today we
are celebrating it here

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:17.020
at the United States
Copyright Office.

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.090
With that I would like to
invite up Whitney Levandusky,

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:22.920
an attorney with the Office of
Public Information and Education

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:24.470
at the Copyright Office.

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:25.770
Whitney will talk a bit more

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:28.950
about the public domains
importance and how it functions.

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:32.260
She'll also introduce our
esteemed speakers for today.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.290
So with that, I will
turn it over to Whitney.

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:36.090
Thank you.

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:44.590
[ Applause ]

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:45.890
&gt;&gt; Whitney Levandusky:
Thank you.

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:48.380
As we heard from Acting
Register Karyn Temple,

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:51.450
we're here to celebrate the
public domain, the next stage

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:52.960
of life for a creative work.

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:56.880
The Constitution allowed
Congress to grant copyright,

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.880
but it also set forth
that the protection was

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.580
for a limited time.

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:03.480
This limited nature is important

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:06.080
to the creative life
of the United States.

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:09.730
Today, you will learn
about the many angles

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:11.400
of the public domain.

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.840
How does it work
for creative people?

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.140
How can it work for each of us?

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:17.980
And where can we find it?

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:21.580
We'll learn about how public
domain works provide an ongoing

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:24.620
and renewable legacy
of creativity.

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:28.310
We'll hear from a documentarian
and a musical historian

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:32.720
about how the public domain
assists and shapes their work.

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.660
We will also explore
this rich background

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:37.150
and highlight some works
and authors of those works

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:39.820
that are entering the
public domain this year.

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:45.230
So, the public domain,
it's not a place.

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:47.240
We can't find it on a map.

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.020
When we say public
domain, we mean simply

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:52.250
that the work is not
protected by copyright

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:55.120
and it's free for anyone to use.

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:58.720
The public domain is a
wellspring of knowledge

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:02.930
and creativity that allows
individuals at institutions

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:06.660
to supply new creativity
and thought.

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:08.960
Vampires -

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:15.460
Pride and Prejudice.

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:18.810
The works of Jules
Verne and H.G. Wells.

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:21.260
These are just a
few brief examples

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.630
about how we've used
the public domain

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:26.560
to inspire new creative works.

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:28.860
The public domain
gives us the ability

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:32.640
to stretch our imaginations,
to take common touchstones

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:37.230
to new places, and
re-evaluate long-standing works

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:40.120
in contemporary times.

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:43.100
While we are highlighting
today the end of copyright term

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:46.210
as one way of growing the
public domain, Karyn mentioned

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:48.980
that the public domain
is far more than works

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:51.450
who copyright term has ended.

00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:53.980
There are a number of other
ways that work - that works are

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:55.590
in the public domain
from their inception.

00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:59.940
All works, for example
created by federal employees

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:03.250
in the scope of their employment
are in the public domain.

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:06.470
A small sampling of works
created by employees

00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:09.740
in the public trust
include the fruits

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:12.930
of the works progress
administration.

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:14.590
The first photograph of earth

00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:19.730
by astronaut Bill
Anders, titled Earth Rise.

00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:24.130
Photographs from field work
by government agencies.

00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:26.430
Medical imageries -

00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:31.910
Medical imagery, there we go.

00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:35.320
And of course, studies
and reports produced

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:38.740
by the government including
the copyright office.

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:41.420
And oftentimes we
use the public domain

00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:44.080
to extend beyond creative works.

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:46.890
We use public domain to
refer to the building blocks

00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:48.530
of knowledge and creativity.

00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:54.070
Things like facts, processes
and systems, basic shapes,

00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:57.560
social dances, short
words and phrases.

00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:01.040
All in all, the public domain
is the wealth of resources

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:04.650
that are available to everyone.

00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:08.350
Now there may be no more
immediate example of inspiration

00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:12.320
of public domain works than
those penned by Shakespeare.

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:14.840
The Folger Shakespeare Library,
which is just across the street

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:18.770
from us, it has the largest
collection of materials relating

00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:21.950
to Shakespeare and his works,
which includes centuries

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:27.890
of adaptations on the stage,
in music, in art and for film.

00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:29.760
We will be using
the long history

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:33.090
of Shakespearian
inspiration as the focal point

00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:34.930
to examine the important role

00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:37.770
of public domain
works and adaptation.

00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:40.740
Our first presenter
is Douglas Lanier.

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:43.920
He is the Professor of English
at University of New Hampshire,

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:45.910
and a long term research fellow

00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:47.850
at the Folger Shakespeare
Library.

00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:52.110
He did is graduate work at Duke
University, and he specialized

00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:54.370
in medieval and early
modern drama.

00:09:54.370 --> 00:09:59.570
He has taught at Duke, UCLA,
Alleghany College, Gonville

00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:03.280
and Caius College, Cambridge,
the University of Milan

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:06.430
and University de
Murcia in Spain.

00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:09.930
His pioneering work in the
study of modern adaptations

00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:13.790
of Shakespeare in mass media
will provide the foundation

00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:16.520
for his insight into the
cultural recirculation

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:19.920
of public domain works,
the cultural after-life

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:23.720
and the elevation of works
through adaptations over time.

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:26.720
His book, Shakespeare and
Modern Popular Culture,

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:28.930
established the basic
parameters of one

00:10:28.930 --> 00:10:31.090
of the five most
liveliest fields

00:10:31.090 --> 00:10:33.000
of Shakespeare studies today.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.340
He is currently at work
on two book projects.

00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:38.450
First, a history of
screen adaptation

00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:41.270
of an Othello worldwide,
and second a study

00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:44.010
of reparative Shakespeare,
which are productions

00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:45.960
of Shakespeare addressed
to the traumas

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:48.110
of socially marginalized groups.

00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:52.510
So please welcome me - in
joining - in welcoming Douglas.

00:10:52.510 --> 00:11:01.890
[ Applause ]

00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:04.820
&gt;&gt; Douglas Lanier:
Hello, can you hear me?

00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:09.580
Of the original public - oops.

00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:11.250
There we go.

00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:14.760
The original public
domain materials

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:18.930
in western culture are what
we've come to call the classics

00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:21.980
of Greek and Latin antiquity.

00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:26.150
They did not begin
their lives as classics.

00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:30.010
These works were freely
available for creative use,

00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:33.400
rhetoricians call imitation,

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:37.180
by all who can master
the written languages.

00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:40.520
It was through their
recirculation and adapted form

00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:44.140
that they attained the
status of a classic.

00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:48.940
The word classic then specifies
not some monumental steady

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:53.060
state, but the result
of an ongoing dynamic,

00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:55.800
always historically
contingent process.

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:59.580
An important condition of
which is the works availability

00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:01.210
in the public realm.

00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:06.770
And this process of
classicizing involves a paradox.

00:12:06.770 --> 00:12:08.210
The cultural after-life

00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:15.640
of a work depends upon its being
creatively altered, repurposed,

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:17.100
appropriated, made

00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:20.160
into something other
than its former self.

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:24.640
A work is effectively dead
unless it has new readers

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:29.280
and audiences, new performers
and adapters who allow it

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:32.470
to speak to a new present.

00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:34.890
I'm going to dodge for the
moment some very tricky

00:12:34.890 --> 00:12:38.230
questions about politics
and ethics

00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:40.750
in this process of
appropriation.

00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:42.500
There's nothing to guarantee

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:46.250
that adaptations will be
faithful to their sources

00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:47.870
and nothing to guarantee

00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:52.760
that adaptations will serve
socially responsible purposes.

00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:56.220
Here I want simply to
observe that a condition

00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:59.780
for art having a
robust after-life is

00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:05.610
that it is available
for creative adaptation.

00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:08.010
Now in the Anglophone
literary tradition,

00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:11.370
several artists have achieved
the status of classics;

00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:13.900
Jane Austen, Charlotte Bronte

00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:17.330
and Charles Dickens come
immediately to mind.

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:23.220
But none has had a history of
adaptation as long, as varied,

00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:27.500
as global in scope
as Shakespeare.

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:31.400
He is the Coca Cola
of literature.

00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:35.430
And through the - and
though the reasons

00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:39.120
for his extraordinary
cultural after-life are many,

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:42.630
one key is that Shakespeare's
work has long been

00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:44.170
in the public domain.

00:13:44.170 --> 00:13:48.440
And therefore, an irresistible
object for adaptation.

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:49.740
Now it's possible to think

00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:53.470
about Shakespearian
adaptation from several angles.

00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:56.980
One has to do with medium.

00:13:56.980 --> 00:14:00.650
Shakespeare's dramatic
writing needs to be converted

00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:05.730
from its initial form as a
script into a living performance

00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:09.290
for any of his works
to become a play.

00:14:09.290 --> 00:14:13.410
Interestingly, Shakespeare's
early cultural after-life

00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:15.040
involve his being presented

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:19.000
in the public realm
in two forms at once.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.280
As a stage performance,
developing in a number

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:25.820
of directions over the
18th and 19th century.

00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:30.930
And as a printed book, first
appearing as the first folio

00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:36.300
in 1623 the printed collection
that redefined Shakespeare

00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:41.140
as an object for readers
rather than theater audiences.

00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:47.820
Now this two-track mode of
adaptation, stage and print,

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:49.870
the two predominant
literary modes

00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:52.870
of the period may
have much to do

00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:57.010
with Shakespeare's
status as a classic.

00:14:57.010 --> 00:15:01.150
As new media emerged
in cultural importance,

00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:05.720
so too did Shakespeare
become accommodated to them.

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:08.980
The 19th century for
example was particularly keen

00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:14.820
to adapt Shakespeare to the
newly ascended form of opera

00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:17.230
and instrumental music.

00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:22.240
In the 20th century, here we go,

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:25.720
Shakespeare's writings have
been adapted to all modes

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:30.660
of new media, advertising
motion pictures, radio,

00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:37.160
audio performance, television,
digital text, even social media.

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:39.490
In the central function

00:15:39.490 --> 00:15:42.100
of Shakespearian
adaptation has been

00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:48.070
to make new media formats seem
less intimidating and alien,

00:15:48.070 --> 00:15:52.920
to demonstrate their utility or
lend them cultural authority.

00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:55.440
This is particularly
true at moments

00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:57.380
where a new medium might seem

00:15:57.380 --> 00:16:01.210
to threaten the cultural
status quo; such was the case

00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:05.190
with silent Shakespeare films
in the early 20th century

00:16:05.190 --> 00:16:10.120
or radio Shakespeare in
the US in the mid-1930's.

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:16.690
In a process we call reciprocal
legitimation Shakespeare serves

00:16:16.690 --> 00:16:19.120
to legitimize the new medium,

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:21.990
while at the same time
the new medium serves

00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:25.410
to legitimize Shakespeare's
status as a classic

00:16:25.410 --> 00:16:27.340
and reconfirm his place

00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:30.210
in the public realm
for a new generation.

00:16:30.210 --> 00:16:32.050
Now I should stress that this -

00:16:32.050 --> 00:16:35.360
that each new media
manifestation

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:40.100
of Shakespeare always involves
reconceiving what Shakespeare

00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:41.410
can be.

00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:44.820
It's never just a
matter of reformatting.

00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:47.090
Film Shakespeare
is very different

00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:50.430
from stage Shakespeare,
print Shakespeare,

00:16:50.430 --> 00:16:53.570
televisional Shakespeare,
radio Shakespeare.

00:16:53.570 --> 00:16:57.380
Each of these media
highlight certain elements

00:16:57.380 --> 00:17:01.140
of Shakespeare's art and
makes new perceptions

00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:03.810
of his achievement possible.

00:17:03.810 --> 00:17:07.470
We come to Shakespeare on film,
with different expectations

00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:10.770
of realism than we do
with print Shakespeare

00:17:10.770 --> 00:17:12.510
or stage Shakespeare.

00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:16.970
The actors work and technique
is different in film Shakespeare

00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:20.120
than it is in audio
or stage productions.

00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:24.370
And how we experience our
Shakespeare in the theater

00:17:24.370 --> 00:17:29.310
and home, on a large or
small screen, in live

00:17:29.310 --> 00:17:33.680
or recorded format effects
how we understand the nature

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:36.670
and significance of
Shakespeare's art.

00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:39.850
A new media can get
us to think anew

00:17:39.850 --> 00:17:42.880
about Shakespeare's
own artistry.

00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:45.300
In the opening speech of Henry V

00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:49.730
for example the chorus
expresses his dissatisfaction

00:17:49.730 --> 00:17:53.060
with the stage apparatus
of the globe theater.

00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:58.860
The wooden O with small casques
and an unworthy scaffold,

00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:04.450
all that is inadequate to the
epic greatness of Henry Campaign

00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:07.660
in the vast fields of France.

00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:12.150
Is Shakespeare here imagining
the as yet, unborn medium

00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:15.650
of modern film with
its capacity to show

00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:20.100
in wide screen splendor what
Shakespeare can only ask his

00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:23.330
audience to imagine
in the mind's eye?

00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:27.810
In other words, does filming
Shakespeare's plays allow us

00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:32.860
to see qualities that
were there all along?

00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:36.250
Shakespeare's cultural
after-life is also dependent

00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:39.990
on our ability to change
the content of his work

00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:43.140
to suit the tenor
and taste of the time

00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:45.870
and the purposes of adaptors.

00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:48.810
Practically no stage production

00:18:48.810 --> 00:18:52.860
of Shakespeare performs
the text as written.

00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:57.620
18th and 19th century dramatis
routinely produced their own

00:18:57.620 --> 00:19:01.630
versions of the plays,
smoothing out the meter,

00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:04.980
adding new characters
and subplots,

00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:09.100
ruthlessly cutting what they
thought was obscure or body.

00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:13.200
Even crafting happy
endings or the tragedies

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:18.770
as Name Tate famously did
for his 1681 King Lear,

00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:23.400
the text of which ruled the
stage for the next 150 years.

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:26.340
Adaptors have filled in
the gaps in the lives

00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:29.860
of Shakespeare's characters
and of Shakespeare himself

00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:33.270
with fully fleshed out
fictional biographies,

00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:35.350
prequels and sequels.

00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:39.560
Some even inserting the
author into the mix.

00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:40.960
The film Shakespeare in Love

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:44.260
for example continues
the long tradition

00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:48.310
of imagining what we can't get
from the historical record.

00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:51.600
The process by which
Shakespeare conceived

00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:54.630
and wrote Romeo and Juliet.

00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:59.500
Shakespeare's scripts are now
routinely recontextualized

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:05.040
in all manners of settings,
from the Tempest in Outer Space

00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:09.330
to Macbeth in a mental hospital
to Midsummer Night's Dream

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:14.580
in modern Hollywood to Othello
in a southern prep school.

00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:17.250
And film and television
have long dressed

00:20:17.250 --> 00:20:21.210
up Shakespeare's work in
modern dress and language,

00:20:21.210 --> 00:20:23.670
so that we're often
watching Shakespeare

00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:26.120
without knowing we're doing so.

00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:30.360
My students are often
surprised when I tell them

00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:34.820
that 10 Things I Hate About You
is an adaptation of the Taming

00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:39.740
of the Shrew, or the Zombie
romance Warm Bodies is a version

00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:42.300
of Romeo and Juliet.

00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:46.660
Indeed the increasingly
oral and visual nature

00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:48.960
of 21st century Shakespeare,

00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:52.860
that is to say it's
non-literary bent as well

00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:55.350
as the globalization
of Shakespeare,

00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:59.180
which is to say Shakespeare
in translation means

00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:02.460
that our Shakespeare
is much less centered

00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:06.150
on the specificities of
Shakespeare's language.

00:21:06.150 --> 00:21:12.010
The wildly popular interactive
performance piece Sleep No More,

00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:17.270
by the British Performance Troop
Punch Drunk uses Shakespeare's

00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:19.890
Macbeth as its inspiration.

00:21:19.890 --> 00:21:23.740
Not a word of Shakespeare's
script is ever uttered

00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:27.740
as the audience wanders through
the company's meticulously

00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:32.570
constructed environment and
watches the silent actors.

00:21:32.570 --> 00:21:35.770
Lastly, Shakespeare's
availability

00:21:35.770 --> 00:21:40.800
in the public realm becomes a
vehicle for cultural dialog.

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:45.530
A shear terrain on which
ideas can do battle or speak

00:21:45.530 --> 00:21:47.860
across cultural divides.

00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:51.920
With Shakespeare adaptors
speak to the present

00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:56.030
through a well-established
common set of stories,

00:21:56.030 --> 00:22:01.150
and they can also talk back to
the past or protest injustice

00:22:01.150 --> 00:22:05.910
by co-opting Shakespeare's
inherited cultural authority.

00:22:05.910 --> 00:22:10.320
The Tempest has long been
recognized as a founding text

00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:13.480
in the discourse of
western colonialism.

00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:19.510
A work that asserts the need to
subjugate unruly native people's

00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:23.270
but through adaptation the
Tempest has become a powerful

00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:27.790
mean to contest colonial
discourse,

00:22:27.790 --> 00:22:33.480
to assert a perspective untold
in Shakespeare's original play.

00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:37.250
In Aime Cesaire's
adaptation Une Tempete,

00:22:37.250 --> 00:22:39.580
the rebellious Caliban proud

00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:44.220
of his African heritage
eventually abandons the old

00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:48.960
helpless prospero, gaining
in the process victory

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:52.020
over his colonial tormentor.

00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:54.710
In Shylock is my Name,

00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:57.510
one of the recent Hogarth
Shakespeare series,

00:22:57.510 --> 00:23:01.670
a set of pros retellings
of Shakespeare's plays,

00:23:01.670 --> 00:23:06.410
Howard Jacobson depicts
and erasable Shylock

00:23:06.410 --> 00:23:10.850
who magically reappears
in contemporary Manchester

00:23:10.850 --> 00:23:15.070
to a modern lapsed
Jew named Strolovich,

00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:18.920
who is himself a
victim of anti-Semitism.

00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:22.730
In the novel, Shylock
uses the situation

00:23:22.730 --> 00:23:27.380
to answer Shakespeare's
anti-Semitic portrayal of him

00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:29.480
in the Merchant of Venice.

00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:33.580
He engineers a way to replay
the famous trial scene

00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:37.310
on his own comic
terms, so that both he

00:23:37.310 --> 00:23:40.270
and Strolovich are redeemed.

00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:45.100
The contemporary Indian
filmmaker Vishal Bhardwaj,

00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:49.530
has made a trio of films that
reimagined Indian culture,

00:23:49.530 --> 00:23:55.310
I'm thinking of the films
Maqbool, Omkara and Haider.

00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:59.740
He uses his Shakespeare
to comment on live issues

00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:03.890
in Indian society, matters
like organized crime

00:24:03.890 --> 00:24:08.160
and civic corruption, the
persistence of the caste system,

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:10.980
honor killing and terrorism.

00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:14.320
The work of Bhardwaj
and other contemporary,

00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:17.190
non-Anglophone adaptors suggest

00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:21.620
that Shakespeare is becoming
a global Lingua Franca,

00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:23.670
a set of plots, characters,

00:24:23.670 --> 00:24:29.960
motifs and themes sufficiently
familiar worldwide to open

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:34.730
up new possibilities of
cross-cultural storytelling.

00:24:34.730 --> 00:24:39.120
Let me end on two points,
first the relationship

00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:42.540
between cultural
after-lives and adaptation

00:24:42.540 --> 00:24:46.720
that I'm discussing is
not unique to Shakespeare.

00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:52.300
He illustrates well the paradox
of art in the public realm.

00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:59.670
That artworks robust cultural
after-life depends upon its

00:24:59.670 --> 00:25:04.640
being taken up and manipulated
by later generations.

00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:07.670
Not all of whom will be
faithful to the original

00:25:07.670 --> 00:25:11.220
or respectful of its intentions.

00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:17.310
Cultural after-lives depend
upon creative infidelity.

00:25:17.310 --> 00:25:22.640
My second point is that if one
takes the long historical view

00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:26.520
adaptation has long
been the cultural norm

00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:28.930
in creative communities.

00:25:28.930 --> 00:25:32.540
The notion that authors
can exercise control

00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:36.530
of after their works have
entered the public arena is a

00:25:36.530 --> 00:25:40.990
relatively new and
culturally specific notion,

00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:45.160
modern copyright
dates from 1709.

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:48.970
And perhaps it's a historical
aberration challenged

00:25:48.970 --> 00:25:53.720
by the creative impulse
to sample a new technology

00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:57.390
that makes that especially
easy to do.

00:25:57.390 --> 00:26:02.280
How to sustain current concepts
of copyright in the face

00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:05.460
of contemporary adaptational
practice seems

00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:07.460
to me a question worth asking.

00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:09.260
Thank you.

00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:24.040
[ Applause ]

00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:25.340
&gt;&gt; Whitney Levandusky:
Thank you Doug.

00:26:25.340 --> 00:26:28.320
So we know that the works of
Shakespeare were never protected

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:30.440
under US copyright law.

00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:33.680
But, what if all
these adaptations

00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:36.150
if they were protected
under copyright,

00:26:36.150 --> 00:26:38.680
how long does protection last?

00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:41.670
Duration of copyright
looks a lot different today

00:26:41.670 --> 00:26:43.220
than it did in 1923.

00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:48.060
For works created today, the
general rule is that duration

00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:51.720
of copyright is life of
the author plus 70 years.

00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:56.360
The works that expired on
January 1, 2019 protect -

00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:58.570
were protected under
an original term

00:26:58.570 --> 00:27:02.280
of 26 years and a renewal term.

00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:05.650
The original term was secured
by publication with notice,

00:27:05.650 --> 00:27:08.590
or registration with
the US Copyright Office.

00:27:08.590 --> 00:27:12.060
The renewal term was
secured only by registration

00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:14.130
with the Copyright Office.

00:27:14.130 --> 00:27:17.170
This renewal term, it
was originally 26 years,

00:27:17.170 --> 00:27:19.430
but through a series
of acts by Congress,

00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:23.650
the last one being the Sonny
Bono Copyright Term Extension

00:27:23.650 --> 00:27:28.860
Act, eventually the renewal
term was extended to 69 years.

00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:30.580
This - Congresses ability

00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:34.260
to pass these extensions was
affirmed by the Supreme Court

00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:36.900
in Eldridge vs. Ashcroft.

00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:40.340
As a result, these works
first publisher registered

00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:44.490
in 1923 secured a
copyright term of 95 years.

00:27:44.490 --> 00:27:47.800
This term structure,
an original term

00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:50.360
and a renewal term
governs all works

00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:55.070
that first secured protection
prior to January 1, 1978.

00:27:55.070 --> 00:27:57.050
There are many technical
rules with duration

00:27:57.050 --> 00:27:58.800
that I won't belabor today.

00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:01.840
But know this, we
will see a new crop

00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:04.750
of works enter the
public domain each year.

00:28:04.750 --> 00:28:07.820
For example, works from 1924
will enter the public domain

00:28:07.820 --> 00:28:09.120
in 2020.

00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:13.310
1925, 2021 and so on.

00:28:13.310 --> 00:28:19.070
The use of public domain images
and footage helps us - oops,

00:28:19.070 --> 00:28:21.040
helps us to build
our sense of history.

00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:23.990
They provide context to
first person narratives.

00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:28.440
An artist can claim -
recast public domain works

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:31.590
to deepen our connections
to the past.

00:28:31.590 --> 00:28:34.580
For example, Peter
Jackson's recent documentary,

00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:37.850
They Shall Not Grow Old
modified original footage

00:28:37.850 --> 00:28:40.690
from World War I
with colorization,

00:28:40.690 --> 00:28:44.740
modern production techniques,
sound effects and voice acting.

In this clip courtesy of
the Imperial War Museum,

00:28:48.430 --> 00:28:49.780
Jackson provides insight

00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:52.440
into the thought process
behind their interpretation

00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:54.320
of public domain footage.

[ Music ]

00:29:13.230 --> 00:29:14.840
In the beginning we -
we were feeling our way

00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:16.400
through what's going to be.

00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:18.140
And by the time we were
finished, it really felt

00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:19.920
like the natural thing to do.

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:21.220
Let them tell their story.

00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:24.280
And they're not telling the
story of why the song happened

00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:27.830
or what - why [Inaudible]
was such a disaster,

00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:29.130
they're not telling that story.

00:29:29.130 --> 00:29:31.220
They're just - they're
just telling us what it was

00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:32.830
like to be a soldier.

00:29:32.830 --> 00:29:34.470
And with that being
the sound track,

00:29:34.470 --> 00:29:39.050
just purely voices it
then became apparent

00:29:39.050 --> 00:29:41.820
that we should try to present
the images with as close

00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:44.060
as we could to what
they experienced.

00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:46.180
And they didn't see the war in
black and white for instance;

00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:47.480
you know they saw
the war in color.

00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:49.190
But we didn't want to
do reconstructions.

00:29:49.190 --> 00:29:52.040
We could easily dress up
a lot of guys in uniforms

00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:53.930
and filmed some stuff today,
but we didn't want to do that.

00:29:53.930 --> 00:29:56.540
We wanted to use
strictly accurate footage.

00:29:56.540 --> 00:29:59.380
Somehow the net result on
that is making these people

00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:01.510
into human beings.

&gt;&gt; Nina Gilden Seavey:
Thank you.

00:31:15.050 --> 00:31:18.140
Well I'm not as famous
as Peter Jackson,

00:31:18.140 --> 00:31:20.890
but he and I share
the same problems

00:31:20.890 --> 00:31:24.320
of how do you create
something out of the past?

00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:29.980
Now in his World War I film
he used public domain images

00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:31.700
as archival material.

00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:35.680
I mean it was literally
artifact of a certain era,

00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:39.030
about which he was making
a very literal film.

00:31:39.030 --> 00:31:42.390
Most documentary filmmakers
are not doing that.

00:31:42.390 --> 00:31:47.410
We're taking images that we
need to represent a story

00:31:47.410 --> 00:31:51.590
that we are shaping into an
entirely different narrative.

00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:54.730
So we're not using these
images as artifact,

00:31:54.730 --> 00:31:57.610
but we're using them
as representation.

00:31:57.610 --> 00:31:59.940
So I - because I am
a professor I'm going

00:31:59.940 --> 00:32:01.680
to give you a little assignment.

00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:05.610
I am going to show
you a clip from a film

00:32:05.610 --> 00:32:09.310
that I made a trailer from
my film A Paralyzing Fear

00:32:09.310 --> 00:32:12.220
of the Story of Polio
in America.

00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:17.730
And this film posed a number
of interesting challenges

00:32:17.730 --> 00:32:19.760
about the public domain.

00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:25.330
Because of course,
filmmakers are omnivorous.

00:32:25.330 --> 00:32:30.280
We need not one series
of images,

00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:32.620
we need thousands of images.

00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:36.650
While I was sitting here,
I was actually thinking

00:32:36.650 --> 00:32:40.070
like how many - like what would
be the average number of images

00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:44.490
in the 90 minute film, which
is what A Paralyzing Fear was.

00:32:44.490 --> 00:32:47.620
So I thought well an image
on the screen changes

00:32:47.620 --> 00:32:50.610
about once every
five seconds, right?

00:32:50.610 --> 00:32:54.860
So theoretically you could
have somewhere between 900

00:32:54.860 --> 00:33:00.560
and 1,000 images that need
to be somehow collected

00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:06.800
and in any given film, and you
need to either own the right

00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:10.290
to that material, or it has
to be in the public domain,

00:33:10.290 --> 00:33:14.690
which means it's not - it's
free and you can use it at will.

00:33:14.690 --> 00:33:17.940
Well the problem for
documentary filmmakers is

00:33:17.940 --> 00:33:20.560
that we are not just
an omnivorous group,

00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:23.090
but we're an impoverished group.

00:33:23.090 --> 00:33:26.290
And so this issue
of what do we use

00:33:26.290 --> 00:33:30.740
and how do we use it becomes
kind of an interesting,

00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:32.520
I wouldn't say it's
a game that we play,

00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:34.520
but it is a little bit of one.

00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:39.730
And there has become, because of
the kind of voracious appetite

00:33:39.730 --> 00:33:44.010
that documentary filmmakers
have we have become a bit

00:33:44.010 --> 00:33:49.080
of an industry for the both
materials that are in copyright

00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:52.250
and that which is entered
into the public domain.

00:33:52.250 --> 00:33:54.450
Now, the good news for
documentary filmmakers is

00:33:54.450 --> 00:33:58.300
that we don't have to wait
very long because for you know,

00:33:58.300 --> 00:34:00.490
unlike Shakespeare where
we had to wait for many,

00:34:00.490 --> 00:34:03.080
many years for that to
enter the public domain,

00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:07.020
in documentary much
of what has come

00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:09.700
into the public domain
were works created

00:34:09.700 --> 00:34:12.960
by the Federal Government
themselves, which is interesting

00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:18.020
because the Federal Government
is indeed a very large producer

00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:19.580
of filmed work.

00:34:19.580 --> 00:34:22.520
So there is an unending
repository

00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:26.270
that I send my students out
into College Park Maryland

00:34:26.270 --> 00:34:28.890
and they have to go look,
like on a treasure hunt

00:34:28.890 --> 00:34:31.230
for some of these images.

00:34:31.230 --> 00:34:35.650
Because they are fertile
territory for great stories

00:34:35.650 --> 00:34:39.240
and the kinds of material
that we love to use in films,

00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:41.060
because A, there's a lot of it.

00:34:41.060 --> 00:34:42.520
And B, it's free.

00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:47.340
So, hence my assignment to
you, which is to take a look

00:34:47.340 --> 00:34:51.200
at this clip and I'm going
to talk to you a little bit

00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:55.920
about the problems and the
opportunities of public domain

00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:57.760
as related to this
particular film.

00:34:57.760 --> 00:34:59.060
It's a little five minute clip.

00:34:59.060 --> 00:35:03.580
I kind of pulled a little bit
of a fast one on our AV people,

00:35:03.580 --> 00:35:06.630
so the people who are
livestreaming this may not be

00:35:06.630 --> 00:35:08.480
able to get it because I'm going

00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:10.330
to show another film a
little bit later along

00:35:10.330 --> 00:35:12.440
that is definitely not
in the public domain.

00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:16.090
But this one is the trailer
for A Paralyzing Fear,

00:35:16.090 --> 00:35:19.160
the Story of Polio in America,
which is also on YouTube.

00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:22.150
So, follow me along and
take a look at this clip

00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:25.340
and then we're going to
talk about the conundrum

00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:28.340
of public domain in documentary.

00:35:32.510 --> 00:35:44.510
[ Music ]

00:35:44.510 --> 00:40:47.500
[ Film ]

00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:49.470
Okay thank you.

00:40:49.470 --> 00:40:55.490
So here was the problem.

00:40:55.490 --> 00:40:59.560
When I decided to make this
film, the - I went to the March

00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:02.400
of Dimes and I said, "I want
to make a film about Polio."

00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:04.660
And they said, "Well you an
everybody else who has ever come

00:41:04.660 --> 00:41:07.180
to us, and the answer is no."

00:41:07.180 --> 00:41:14.450
Because they owned all of the
rights to all of the material.

00:41:14.450 --> 00:41:19.270
So not being one to ever take
no for an answer, I begged

00:41:19.270 --> 00:41:24.840
and I pleaded and I collected
all of the best historians

00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:28.990
of science and medicine and many
famous people who had had Polio

00:41:28.990 --> 00:41:30.320
and they lobbied on my behalf.

00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:35.250
And finally the March of
Dimes said, "Okay we're going

00:41:35.250 --> 00:41:38.420
to let you be the
first filmmaker

00:41:38.420 --> 00:41:43.440
that we have ever
given our archive to.

00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:46.630
There is a warehouse
in Fort Lee, New Jersey

00:41:46.630 --> 00:41:48.700
and we don't know how
many films are there,

00:41:48.700 --> 00:41:50.000
and how many photographs.

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:51.520
But we're going to
give you the key."

00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:55.210
So I got my trusted
crew together

00:41:55.210 --> 00:41:57.710
and got an 18 wheeler
truck and we went

00:41:57.710 --> 00:41:59.010
up to Fort Lee, New Jersey.

00:41:59.010 --> 00:42:02.700
And sure enough we
pulled out 3,000 films

00:42:02.700 --> 00:42:04.160
and 5,000 photographs.

00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:08.080
It's an interesting
amount of material.

00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:10.890
So, I started looking at
this stuff and I thought

00:42:10.890 --> 00:42:13.080
to myself, well wait a minute.

00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:17.090
The Federal Government
was involved in the fight

00:42:17.090 --> 00:42:23.350
against Polio, so a lot
of this is their footage.

00:42:23.350 --> 00:42:25.480
And as we find out in this piece

00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:28.110
and as you probably
know already,

00:42:28.110 --> 00:42:30.010
the person who really
led the fight

00:42:30.010 --> 00:42:34.240
against Polio was
FDR, as President.

00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:38.510
And so a lot of that material
was also taken during the time

00:42:38.510 --> 00:42:41.360
that he was President
of the United States.

00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:45.070
And was in the FDR
Library at Warm Springs.

00:42:45.070 --> 00:42:49.160
And so honestly I started to
question a little bit the March

00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:51.580
of Dimes claim on this material.

00:42:51.580 --> 00:42:55.680
Now, we came to what we
call a blanket license.

00:42:55.680 --> 00:42:59.140
I paid them a heap of money,
they give me a heap of film

00:42:59.140 --> 00:43:02.310
and photographs,
everybody goes home happy.

00:43:02.310 --> 00:43:06.580
But, in the question of what
was in the public domain,

00:43:06.580 --> 00:43:10.480
it really became kind of a bit
of a head scratcher for me.

00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:13.350
Because I thought wait a minute,
they are claiming copyright

00:43:13.350 --> 00:43:17.170
to something that I know
for a fact they don't own.

00:43:17.170 --> 00:43:20.230
But I decided we're going
to leave that to the side

00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:23.440
for the moment because
some of the material,

00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:27.360
I mean they were a private
foundation with monies raised

00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:29.200
through private funds.

00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:31.070
And so a lot of it was theirs.

00:43:31.070 --> 00:43:34.440
But it was all mixed together.

00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:37.890
And hence, the problem
for the documentarian.

00:43:37.890 --> 00:43:43.560
Is that there is - we live
in the era of motion picture

00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:47.160
and have since the
beginning of the 20th century.

00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:51.320
And where this material
comes from

00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:57.280
and how do you trace it back
becomes a bit of a puzzle.

00:43:57.280 --> 00:44:03.330
Well that puzzle becomes I
think ever more interesting

00:44:03.330 --> 00:44:07.190
because somewhere,
somewhere along the line,

00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:12.020
especially after the cable
industry entered sort

00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:14.960
of the documentary filmmaking
world with the History Channel

00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:17.530
and Discovery Channel and
National Geographic Channel,

00:44:17.530 --> 00:44:19.110
and all of these other channels.

00:44:19.110 --> 00:44:22.310
And the need for documentary
films just exploded,

00:44:22.310 --> 00:44:25.920
so did the need for material

00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:29.360
around which these
films would be made.

00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:34.080
So, many enterprising
young entrepreneurs came

00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:38.610
to Washington, to the Library
of Congress where we are today

00:44:38.610 --> 00:44:41.700
and to the National Archives
where we are down the street,

00:44:41.700 --> 00:44:46.950
and they copied everything,
which is interesting, right?

00:44:46.950 --> 00:44:50.320
Because what they did is
they took everything that was

00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:52.920
in the public domain, and you
have all of these filmmakers

00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:55.630
from all around the
world who was omnivorous

00:44:55.630 --> 00:45:01.350
and finance starved as I am
and they sell the material

00:45:01.350 --> 00:45:03.040
that is in the public domain.

00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:06.130
They don't call it
a right's fee,

00:45:06.130 --> 00:45:08.930
they call it you know
an acquisition fee

00:45:08.930 --> 00:45:11.260
or an administrative fee.

00:45:11.260 --> 00:45:15.620
But in fact, what you're doing
is you're paying for the rights

00:45:15.620 --> 00:45:18.880
to public domain material
because you're sitting

00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:20.960
out in Omaha, Nebraska

00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:23.600
and Nebraska Public
Television wants you

00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:25.880
to make a nice documentary
about you know,

00:45:25.880 --> 00:45:27.790
an issue for which
there is plenty

00:45:27.790 --> 00:45:29.090
of public domain material.

00:45:29.090 --> 00:45:31.220
It's going to cost a
lot of money to send you

00:45:31.220 --> 00:45:34.140
to the National Archive, plus
you probably don't have the time

00:45:34.140 --> 00:45:35.440
that it takes, which
his six weeks

00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:37.150
to get the material we produced.

00:45:37.150 --> 00:45:40.570
So, there is an industry
that has actually developed

00:45:40.570 --> 00:45:43.750
around public domain
material because we are

00:45:43.750 --> 00:45:48.750
as I said a voracious
consumer of material.

00:45:48.750 --> 00:45:53.000
So - but there is still
a lot of question.

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:56.550
Just in that little clip
alone there are I don't know,

00:45:56.550 --> 00:45:58.650
over 100 images, right?

00:45:58.650 --> 00:46:04.390
From the past and I can promise
you that the March of Dimes,

00:46:04.390 --> 00:46:08.640
nor any other rights holder
knows who owns what to whom.

00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:10.590
We do know that probably the -

00:46:10.590 --> 00:46:12.290
you know the Walt
Disney Material,

00:46:12.290 --> 00:46:14.560
we know who owns that, right?

00:46:14.560 --> 00:46:17.870
But aside from that I can
promise you nobody else is quite

00:46:17.870 --> 00:46:20.830
clear on the - on that subject.

00:46:20.830 --> 00:46:26.230
So, it's an interesting
problem of how do you tether out

00:46:26.230 --> 00:46:28.500
and documentary filmmakers,
I'm not going to bore you

00:46:28.500 --> 00:46:30.300
with the legalities of this.

00:46:30.300 --> 00:46:34.700
I mean lawyers kind of
owing - owning our lives.

00:46:34.700 --> 00:46:37.100
We all documentary
filmmakers carry errors

00:46:37.100 --> 00:46:38.830
and admissions insurance.

00:46:38.830 --> 00:46:40.820
And that guarantees
to a broadcaster

00:46:40.820 --> 00:46:44.660
that when we bring something
to them, that they're not going

00:46:44.660 --> 00:46:47.550
to libel for violation
of copyright,

00:46:47.550 --> 00:46:49.840
but rather we take
the responsibility.

00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:53.860
We take the liability for any
error that we may have incurred

00:46:53.860 --> 00:46:55.990
so that nobody is
held responsible

00:46:55.990 --> 00:46:58.600
at the network level, but the
documentary filmmaker is going

00:46:58.600 --> 00:47:01.450
to take all the responsibility
on him or herself,

00:47:01.450 --> 00:47:03.370
which is quite a burden.

00:47:03.370 --> 00:47:06.720
But the fact is is
that trying to parse

00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:11.730
out where does this stuff come
from, who owns it and when it is

00:47:11.730 --> 00:47:15.520
in the public domain why
am I really paying for it?

00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:20.120
Because it has become a very
large profitable industry

00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:23.660
for many companies, and I
salute them for their you know,

00:47:23.660 --> 00:47:27.090
their enterprise that
have managed to take kind

00:47:27.090 --> 00:47:29.850
of the cabilzation of
American life and turned it

00:47:29.850 --> 00:47:35.430
into quite a profitable
business for them.

00:47:35.430 --> 00:47:40.100
The last little bit I'm going
to talk about is the confusion

00:47:40.100 --> 00:47:42.870
between - amongst documentary
filmmakers and the public

00:47:42.870 --> 00:47:48.760
at large about what is in public
domain and what is fair use.

00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:51.370
Fair use, and my students
do this all the time.

00:47:51.370 --> 00:47:52.670
"Oh I can use that,
its fair use.

00:47:52.670 --> 00:47:54.530
It's on YouTube."

00:47:54.530 --> 00:47:56.830
Uh oh -

00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:03.130
There is a common belief
that if it's out there,

00:48:03.130 --> 00:48:05.890
and I can get it, it's mine.

00:48:05.890 --> 00:48:08.100
And fair use and
I'm not going to go

00:48:08.100 --> 00:48:10.470
into you know the
complications of it,

00:48:10.470 --> 00:48:14.320
is actually a fairly
limited classification

00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:16.100
under which a documentary
filmmaker

00:48:16.100 --> 00:48:18.820
or someone else can
take a piece of material

00:48:18.820 --> 00:48:23.030
that is indeed copyrighted and
used for their own purposes.

00:48:23.030 --> 00:48:26.840
One of those - the central
premise of fair use is

00:48:26.840 --> 00:48:30.640
that the rights holder, if
you're creating a polemic

00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:34.620
of something and they would have
every reason not to grant you -

00:48:34.620 --> 00:48:39.100
not to grant you copyright
in this issue of the polemic

00:48:39.100 --> 00:48:42.540
and it's kind of part of -
in the public discourse then

00:48:42.540 --> 00:48:45.020
that is a pretty
legitimate fair use claim.

00:48:45.020 --> 00:48:49.430
I'm going to show you a clip
from my most recent work

00:48:49.430 --> 00:48:51.900
and this cannot be streamed
because the question

00:48:51.900 --> 00:48:56.790
of fair use has yet to
be fought on this one.

00:48:56.790 --> 00:49:00.910
But it does pose sort of
an interesting challenge

00:49:00.910 --> 00:49:05.970
to who owns what and how much
documentary filmmakers sort

00:49:05.970 --> 00:49:07.730
of claim for themselves.

00:49:07.730 --> 00:49:11.930
Anyway, this is a clip from my
new project called My Fugitive.

00:49:11.930 --> 00:49:13.940
And will not be streamed.

00:49:13.940 --> 00:49:16.910
What I found, and I'm not
going to tell you everything.

00:49:16.910 --> 00:49:19.760
The project will
drop on May 4, 2020,

00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:23.770
which is the 50th anniversary
of the Kent State Murders,

00:49:23.770 --> 00:49:26.700
was the connection between what
happened to Howard Becanick

00:49:26.700 --> 00:49:28.600
and his other co-defendants.

00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:31.670
And the investigation
into the conspiracy

00:49:31.670 --> 00:49:34.780
to assassinate Dr.
Martin Luther King.

00:49:34.780 --> 00:49:39.210
So, the question as to what is
going to enter into fair use

00:49:39.210 --> 00:49:42.470
on this particular
project is going to be kind

00:49:42.470 --> 00:49:43.770
of a long and protractive one.

00:49:43.770 --> 00:49:45.930
I have great legal
representation.

00:49:45.930 --> 00:49:50.840
So - but it is an
interesting kind of conundrum -

00:49:50.840 --> 00:49:53.540
for documentary filmmakers
between what is

00:49:53.540 --> 00:49:57.430
in the public domain and what
is available to us for fair use,

00:49:57.430 --> 00:50:01.160
which is an altogether other
and interesting dialog.

00:50:01.160 --> 00:50:03.600
On that note, I'd like to
conclude, and I thank you

00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:05.510
for your time and
appreciate your attention.

00:50:05.510 --> 00:50:19.430
[ Applause ]

00:50:19.430 --> 00:50:20.800
&gt;&gt; Whitney Levandusky:
Thank you Nina.

00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:24.120
So one of the things that Nina
touched on was the essential

00:50:24.120 --> 00:50:27.060
and sometimes difficult
issue of access,

00:50:27.060 --> 00:50:29.960
that idea of sending
students out to College Park

00:50:29.960 --> 00:50:33.840
to do the treasure hunt
for government works.

00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:37.420
Access to public domain
works is as important

00:50:37.420 --> 00:50:41.150
to the public domain as
the public domain itself.

00:50:41.150 --> 00:50:44.250
You can find and use public
domain works at a number

00:50:44.250 --> 00:50:45.870
of cultural institutions

00:50:45.870 --> 00:50:48.590
from your local library
to a national museum.

00:50:48.590 --> 00:50:52.250
Here at the copyright
office we have much

00:50:52.250 --> 00:50:54.060
of our records available
to the public.

00:50:54.060 --> 00:50:56.890
Our production as
government workers,

00:50:56.890 --> 00:50:59.090
and we are expanding the
number and type of records

00:50:59.090 --> 00:51:02.090
that we can make
public available online.

00:51:02.090 --> 00:51:05.630
The Library of Congress has
many of its collections scant

00:51:05.630 --> 00:51:07.660
and available for use.

00:51:07.660 --> 00:51:10.040
In the films that we're
sharing today come

00:51:10.040 --> 00:51:12.650
from the Packard Campus of
the Library of Congress.

00:51:12.650 --> 00:51:16.050
The Packard Campus has a
screening room and theater

00:51:16.050 --> 00:51:18.170
in Culpepper, Virginia.

00:51:18.170 --> 00:51:20.070
In addition, there
are many private

00:51:20.070 --> 00:51:23.590
and non-profit online resources
for public domain works,

00:51:23.590 --> 00:51:25.910
including Project
Gutenberg, HathiTrust,

00:51:25.910 --> 00:51:29.020
Amazon, Kindle and Google.

00:51:29.020 --> 00:51:31.280
So, onto musicals.

00:51:31.280 --> 00:51:33.980
A quintessentially
American art form.

00:51:33.980 --> 00:51:37.640
From the late 19th century to
today musicals have evolved

00:51:37.640 --> 00:51:41.170
in form, narrative
and production.

00:51:41.170 --> 00:51:42.860
This year, musical works

00:51:42.860 --> 00:51:45.680
from multiple productions
enter the public domain,

00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:49.760
including the Rise of Rose
O'Reilly by George M. Cohan,

00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:53.380
A Perfect Lady by George
Gershwin, Music Box Revue

00:51:53.380 --> 00:51:58.170
by Irving Berlin and the
Wallflower by Oscar Hammerstein.

00:51:58.170 --> 00:52:00.800
Our next presenter
is Benjamin West.

00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:03.670
A director, producer, performer,

00:52:03.670 --> 00:52:06.310
writer and musical
theater historian.

00:52:06.310 --> 00:52:09.560
His current projects
include the Showtime Trilogy,

00:52:09.560 --> 00:52:11.650
Direct from Proctors
23rd Street Theater

00:52:11.650 --> 00:52:14.730
for one night only,
January 16, 1920.

00:52:14.730 --> 00:52:16.880
And 514 Broadway.

00:52:16.880 --> 00:52:20.390
West's directing credits
include Unsung Caroline Lee

00:52:20.390 --> 00:52:23.850
for Lincoln Center's American
Songbook, Gatsby the Songs

00:52:23.850 --> 00:52:28.170
and Concert, Make Mine Manhattan
and the Fig Leaves are Falling.

00:52:28.170 --> 00:52:31.660
His Broadway credits include
assistant director and drama

00:52:31.660 --> 00:52:36.400
for Old Acquaintance, assistant
producer for August Osage County

00:52:36.400 --> 00:52:40.510
and the Homecoming, and product
assistant for Talk Radio.

00:52:40.510 --> 00:52:43.320
He is the founder of
Unsung Musical Company,

00:52:43.320 --> 00:52:48.780
a 2017 recipient of Lincoln
Center's Martin E. Segal Award.

00:52:48.780 --> 00:52:51.940
He will share with us
a case study in the use

00:52:51.940 --> 00:52:55.130
of public domain works from his
documentary musical series The

00:52:55.130 --> 00:52:56.450
Showtime Trilogy.

00:52:56.450 --> 00:53:00.400
The second installment of this
trilogy entitled 45 Minutes

00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:03.810
from Coon Town, a Celebration
of Black Musical Theater,

00:53:03.810 --> 00:53:06.010
tracing its history
from the late 1800's

00:53:06.010 --> 00:53:09.430
through 1999 will
open on September 12,

00:53:09.430 --> 00:53:14.750
2019 at the York Theater
Company in New York City.

00:53:14.750 --> 00:53:17.510
So, without further
ado Benjamin West.

00:53:17.510 --> 00:53:28.100
[ Applause ]

00:53:28.100 --> 00:53:30.400
&gt;&gt; Benjamin West: Good morning.

00:53:35.640 --> 00:53:37.080
Thank you Whitney.

00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:40.980
I am Ben West, and I am
a musical theater artist

00:53:40.980 --> 00:53:42.670
and historian.

00:53:42.670 --> 00:53:46.670
My focus and my passion
is really two fold.

00:53:46.670 --> 00:53:50.160
One illuminating the
intersection of past, present

00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:53.800
and future, effectively
how successive generations

00:53:53.800 --> 00:53:57.210
of artists and audiences
continue to influence

00:53:57.210 --> 00:54:01.790
and inform one another, and
two exploring how the American

00:54:01.790 --> 00:54:05.440
musical is a reflection
of American consciousness.

00:54:05.440 --> 00:54:09.000
So effectively it's
capturing our social, cultural

00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:12.160
and political sensibilities
at any moment

00:54:12.160 --> 00:54:14.580
in time throughout its history.

00:54:14.580 --> 00:54:18.330
There are two quotes that
speak to both of these themes

00:54:18.330 --> 00:54:22.090
and I happen to love,
one is by a lyricist

00:54:22.090 --> 00:54:24.260
and composer Harold Rome,

00:54:24.260 --> 00:54:27.310
who was a tremendous
Broadway review writer,

00:54:27.310 --> 00:54:31.250
and also wrote a number of book
musicals, Destry Rides Again

00:54:31.250 --> 00:54:33.450
and Fanny are two of his shows.

00:54:33.450 --> 00:54:37.570
And he says whether you want to
be original, or whether you want

00:54:37.570 --> 00:54:41.710
to be conventional you still
have to know what has been done

00:54:41.710 --> 00:54:44.090
in order to be either.

00:54:44.090 --> 00:54:46.150
This is a quote that
I particularly love.

00:54:46.150 --> 00:54:48.980
And the other one is from
YipHarburg who you'll know

00:54:48.980 --> 00:54:51.900
as the lyricist of
the Wizard of Oz,

00:54:51.900 --> 00:54:53.710
of Brother Can you Spare a Dime

00:54:53.710 --> 00:54:55.750
and a number of Broadway
musicals.

00:54:55.750 --> 00:55:00.600
And he says, "A songwriter
is really a journalist

00:55:00.600 --> 00:55:02.810
of time with music."

00:55:02.810 --> 00:55:06.040
So both of these
quotes certainly feed me

00:55:06.040 --> 00:55:08.500
and I think feed my focus.

00:55:08.500 --> 00:55:12.770
And with these two focuses
I'm looking a lot at writers,

00:55:12.770 --> 00:55:17.100
creators, craftsman of the form
and my projects tend to deal

00:55:17.100 --> 00:55:19.600
with the history of
the American musical

00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:21.740
in some way, shape or form.

00:55:21.740 --> 00:55:23.460
And in dealing with the history

00:55:23.460 --> 00:55:26.680
of the American musical
I am working a lot

00:55:26.680 --> 00:55:29.650
with public domain materials.

00:55:29.650 --> 00:55:32.840
And in fact all five of
these songs that you see

00:55:32.840 --> 00:55:36.980
up here are currently in
public domain, and all five

00:55:36.980 --> 00:55:39.630
of these songs are
also incorporated

00:55:39.630 --> 00:55:44.470
into my current project,
which is the Showtime Trilogy.

00:55:44.470 --> 00:55:48.290
And with that, I'll give you a
brief background on the trilogy

00:55:48.290 --> 00:55:51.440
and then we're going to look
at two specific sequences

00:55:51.440 --> 00:55:55.290
so we can have a sense of how
public domain works are used

00:55:55.290 --> 00:55:58.040
in the creation of
this new work.

00:55:58.040 --> 00:56:02.550
The Showtime Trilogy is a
project I began developing

00:56:02.550 --> 00:56:06.770
about five years ago now, almost
five years ago and research

00:56:06.770 --> 00:56:10.080
for the piece has taken me to
more than 20 different archives

00:56:10.080 --> 00:56:12.980
across the country,
including here in DC,

00:56:12.980 --> 00:56:15.800
the Library of Congress of
course, the copyright office

00:56:15.800 --> 00:56:19.180
and actually also Howard
University, I should mention.

00:56:19.180 --> 00:56:25.080
The trilogy is three documentary
musicals which celebrate

00:56:25.080 --> 00:56:29.130
and chart the history
of the American musical.

00:56:29.130 --> 00:56:33.350
Now the project aims to be
comprehensive in its coverage,

00:56:33.350 --> 00:56:38.410
so we go back to minstrelsy
and vaudeville in the 1800's.

00:56:38.410 --> 00:56:41.940
We move through the turn of
the century musical burlesque

00:56:41.940 --> 00:56:45.660
and American operetta,
George M. Cohan and so forth,

00:56:45.660 --> 00:56:48.950
all the way to the
works of George C. Wolfe

00:56:48.950 --> 00:56:53.450
and Jason Robert Brown in the
1990's and the cut off point

00:56:53.450 --> 00:56:56.470
for the project is 1999.

00:56:56.470 --> 00:57:00.250
In terms of the documentary
musical construct.

00:57:00.250 --> 00:57:02.980
It is a form that
I've been developing

00:57:02.980 --> 00:57:04.280
over the past several years,

00:57:04.280 --> 00:57:06.580
and I do believe it's
unique in its form.

00:57:06.580 --> 00:57:11.620
We are essentially weaving
live music and live performance

00:57:11.620 --> 00:57:14.580
through this non-fiction
historical narrative

00:57:14.580 --> 00:57:17.810
to tell the story of
the American musical.

00:57:17.810 --> 00:57:21.070
Now each piece is
designed as a solo show.

00:57:21.070 --> 00:57:24.350
And the narrator is very
much an omniscient vessel,

00:57:24.350 --> 00:57:26.560
through whom the
history flows forth,

00:57:26.560 --> 00:57:29.440
and in whom the various
styles of music

00:57:29.440 --> 00:57:32.310
and performance are embodied.

00:57:32.310 --> 00:57:35.410
Each piece, I should also
mention is fully scripted

00:57:35.410 --> 00:57:37.470
and so it is a fully
scripted musical.

00:57:37.470 --> 00:57:40.450
Again, it's non-fiction,
so we're not talking

00:57:40.450 --> 00:57:43.790
about a historical or
biographic dramatization,

00:57:43.790 --> 00:57:46.390
but it's actually
documentary in nature.

00:57:46.390 --> 00:57:50.800
And as such, we're
utilizing narration, quotes,

00:57:50.800 --> 00:57:55.230
newspaper articles and existing
songs to tell this story

00:57:55.230 --> 00:57:58.090
of a uniquely American art form.

00:57:58.090 --> 00:58:01.530
And it's very much; I should
point out an active story.

00:58:01.530 --> 00:58:04.160
It's a very active,
theatrical story.

00:58:04.160 --> 00:58:08.490
And in terms of the songs the
trilogy all told uses more

00:58:08.490 --> 00:58:13.840
than 100 songs in the telling of
this story, 100 existing songs.

00:58:13.840 --> 00:58:16.220
And that's 100 -
more than 100 songs

00:58:16.220 --> 00:58:18.280
over all three installments.

00:58:18.280 --> 00:58:21.690
So, I'll break down quickly
the installments for you.

00:58:21.690 --> 00:58:25.660
The first installment and
primary entry is Showtime,

00:58:25.660 --> 00:58:29.050
the First 100 years of
the American Musical.

00:58:29.050 --> 00:58:32.700
And this really looks at the
evolution of the form itself

00:58:32.700 --> 00:58:34.330
and its cultural impact.

00:58:34.330 --> 00:58:36.320
And just a quick
example of what I mean

00:58:36.320 --> 00:58:37.810
by the evolution of the form.

00:58:37.810 --> 00:58:43.030
New York Time article 1907 this
is - it reads in part talking

00:58:43.030 --> 00:58:45.870
about the form about the
musical, this American musical.

00:58:45.870 --> 00:58:51.650
New York Times 1907,
"Fashions in plays may change,

00:58:51.650 --> 00:58:56.220
but musical comedy remains about
the same from beginning to end.

00:58:56.220 --> 00:58:58.370
It is taken as a
matter of course

00:58:58.370 --> 00:59:00.560
that the tunes will
be reminiscent.

00:59:00.560 --> 00:59:04.660
The characters are nearly always
the same and the comedy in many

00:59:04.660 --> 00:59:09.020
of these shows is
the saddest feature.

00:59:09.020 --> 00:59:13.720
There are, as a rule, only
two classes of musical comedy.

00:59:13.720 --> 00:59:16.750
The good and the bad."

00:59:16.750 --> 00:59:20.620
And then we jump forward 40
years and Alan J. Lerner,

00:59:20.620 --> 00:59:23.050
who you'll know as the
author of My Fair Lady

00:59:23.050 --> 00:59:28.070
and Brigadoon speaking about the
American musical, again 1947.

00:59:28.070 --> 00:59:31.370
And he says, "The
musical theater

00:59:31.370 --> 00:59:36.440
in America is becoming a vital
medium of dramatic expression.

00:59:36.440 --> 00:59:40.050
With words, music and
movement, blended together

00:59:40.050 --> 00:59:45.790
in complete synchronization
a real art form is revealed."

00:59:45.790 --> 00:59:49.220
So Showtime is essentially
looking at this evolution

00:59:49.220 --> 00:59:52.860
from minstrelsy, vaudeville,
early musical comedy

00:59:52.860 --> 00:59:56.990
into the real art form being
revealed and through to the 90s.

00:59:56.990 --> 01:00:01.340
I'll also point out this first
installment premiered this past

01:00:01.340 --> 01:00:03.740
September at the
Theater at St. Peter's.

01:00:03.740 --> 01:00:07.020
And the second installment
45 Minutes

01:00:07.020 --> 01:00:09.990
from Coon Town will premier
this coming September

01:00:09.990 --> 01:00:11.440
at the same venue.

01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:15.060
45 Minutes from Coon
Town is specifically

01:00:15.060 --> 01:00:20.060
about Black musicals and
Black writers in particular.

01:00:20.060 --> 01:00:24.500
And the third and final
installment is 68 Ways to Go,

01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:27.480
which is about female
musical theater, writers

01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:30.090
and that will premier in 2020.

01:00:30.090 --> 01:00:33.670
And then the plan is to premier
the trilogy in its entirety

01:00:33.670 --> 01:00:38.980
in 2021 where we will have
each show in succession.

01:00:38.980 --> 01:00:43.760
Now that's the trilogy and we'll
take a look at two sequences

01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:47.120
from the primary entry Show
time the First 100 years

01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:50.310
to give a sense of how public
domain material has been used

01:00:50.310 --> 01:00:53.250
in creating the narrative
and creating the peace.

01:00:53.250 --> 01:00:55.850
Showtime the First 100 years,

01:00:55.850 --> 01:01:01.690
the primary entry utilizes
59 existing songs in total,

01:01:01.690 --> 01:01:04.540
21 of those are public domain

01:01:04.540 --> 01:01:07.210
and 38 are still
under copyright.

01:01:07.210 --> 01:01:09.960
The show is two acts, including
the intermission it runs

01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:12.550
about 2:20, 2:25.

01:01:12.550 --> 01:01:15.540
We'll look at two
specific songs that are

01:01:15.540 --> 01:01:18.110
in Showtime the first 100 Years.

01:01:18.110 --> 01:01:22.880
They are Jazz Baby
and Prohibition Blues.

01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:26.380
Completely coincidentally
both are from 1919

01:01:26.380 --> 01:01:30.890
and both are co-authored
by a female writer.

01:01:30.890 --> 01:01:34.110
Jazz Baby has lyrics
by Blanche Merrill

01:01:34.110 --> 01:01:39.930
and Prohibition Blues
has music by Nora Bayes.

01:01:39.930 --> 01:01:44.570
Now when we encounter these
songs in Showtime it's

01:01:44.570 --> 01:01:47.820
in a scene that deals with
the early 20th century.

01:01:47.820 --> 01:01:50.720
We begin the scene talking
about the various musical styles

01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:53.360
that are spreading across
the stage at that time.

01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:58.460
And then we get to rag time
and its evolution into jazz.

01:01:58.460 --> 01:02:00.850
And you'll see we come
to Jazz Baby here.

01:02:00.850 --> 01:02:02.930
So, just a brief
point about part

01:02:02.930 --> 01:02:04.440
of the language of the show.

01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:08.800
The lyric in almost all of the
songs was specifically chosen

01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:13.060
to filter into the narrative,
to become part of the narrative.

01:02:13.060 --> 01:02:15.420
So we mention rag time evolving,

01:02:15.420 --> 01:02:17.430
but we don't actually
mention jazz.

01:02:17.430 --> 01:02:20.950
And so the question of into
what does it evolve is answered

01:02:20.950 --> 01:02:22.250
through the song.

01:02:22.250 --> 01:02:26.700
So music comes in and we have
the first chorus of jazz baby

01:02:26.700 --> 01:02:30.040
and then you'll see music
under at the bottom of that.

01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:32.680
Again another part of the
language in storytelling

01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:36.840
in this particular show, music
is woven through the narrative

01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:38.700
through much of the show.

01:02:38.700 --> 01:02:40.180
So you'll see music
will continue

01:02:40.180 --> 01:02:43.230
under for an Irving
Berlin quote.

01:02:43.230 --> 01:02:45.330
And again speaking
further to the language

01:02:45.330 --> 01:02:47.370
of the show you'll
see a parenthetical

01:02:47.370 --> 01:02:48.670
that says down beats only.

01:02:48.670 --> 01:02:50.580
Then we have one line of dialog

01:02:50.580 --> 01:02:53.900
and then we have music
full for the quote.

01:02:53.900 --> 01:02:57.050
Music and also acoustic
sounds effects that are made

01:02:57.050 --> 01:03:01.300
by the drummer and his various
toys are used throughout the

01:03:01.300 --> 01:03:03.180
show, throughout
the entire piece

01:03:03.180 --> 01:03:08.590
as really connective tissue, and
also as oral quotation marks.

01:03:08.590 --> 01:03:11.540
So, when you see - we're going
to show a video clip of this,

01:03:11.540 --> 01:03:14.030
you'll see that there's going
to be just downbeats only

01:03:14.030 --> 01:03:17.460
for two bars where we set up the
quote, and then music will come

01:03:17.460 --> 01:03:19.800
in fully under the quote itself.

01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:22.320
So, it's to help
differentiate and delineate

01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:26.080
between what is narration
and what is the actual quote.

01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:29.730
Following the Irving Berlin
quote we go into another bit

01:03:29.730 --> 01:03:32.530
of Jazz Baby and then you'll
see music under - at the bottom

01:03:32.530 --> 01:03:34.620
of the screen here, stop time.

01:03:34.620 --> 01:03:36.480
So we're going to go
music under again,

01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:39.390
this time for a Rosamond
Johnson quote.

01:03:39.390 --> 01:03:41.560
He was an early Black composer.

01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:44.490
And this is going to be
speaking about Negro spirituals

01:03:44.490 --> 01:03:48.200
and the routes of this form
and essentially harking back

01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:50.930
to slavery - harkening
back to slavery.

01:03:50.930 --> 01:03:55.680
And in so doing the feel of the
underscore is entirely different

01:03:55.680 --> 01:03:58.790
than the feel of the more
celebratory Irving Berlin quote.

01:03:58.790 --> 01:04:02.250
We're going to be in stop time,
which you'll see in a moment.

01:04:02.250 --> 01:04:04.780
And also you'll notice
that it's going to go minor

01:04:04.780 --> 01:04:06.630
in what we're talking about.

01:04:06.630 --> 01:04:11.130
And music will cut out after
that, so I'll stop there,

01:04:11.130 --> 01:04:12.850
and then we're going to take
a look at the video right now.

01:04:12.850 --> 01:04:15.770
I want to mention just
three quick points.

01:04:15.770 --> 01:04:18.660
My music collaborator
for the entire trilogy,

01:04:18.660 --> 01:04:21.310
all three installments
is Fran Menaric

01:04:21.310 --> 01:04:24.480
who has created all new
arrangements for all

01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:26.840
of the songs, and
helped me to weave them

01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:28.940
through the narrative
quite literally.

01:04:28.940 --> 01:04:31.960
Our director and musical stager

01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:36.170
for Showtime the First 100
years is Shannon Lewis.

01:04:36.170 --> 01:04:39.880
And then at the beginning of
the clip there is a drum roll,

01:04:39.880 --> 01:04:41.900
that's not actually
part of the script.

01:04:41.900 --> 01:04:44.330
That is just setting
up the clip;

01:04:44.330 --> 01:04:46.490
so disregard the drum roll.

01:04:46.490 --> 01:04:51.510
All right, so let's take a look
at this Jazz Baby sequence.

01:04:51.510 --> 01:06:46.510
[ Music ]

01:06:46.510 --> 01:06:51.580
[ Applause ]

01:06:51.580 --> 01:06:55.870
So that is a bit of
the Jazz Baby sequence.

01:06:55.870 --> 01:06:59.010
And in fact, it continues
right on.

01:06:59.010 --> 01:07:02.100
There's no break from the
Rosamond Johnson quote,

01:07:02.100 --> 01:07:04.570
we go into a socio
political section,

01:07:04.570 --> 01:07:06.830
small sociopolitical section.

01:07:06.830 --> 01:07:10.780
Because again, one of the themes
being the American musical

01:07:10.780 --> 01:07:13.660
as a reflection of our
social consciousness.

01:07:13.660 --> 01:07:16.550
So again from Rosamond
Johnson we go directly

01:07:16.550 --> 01:07:20.510
into a section about
Black writers.

01:07:20.510 --> 01:07:23.730
And so I actually have a
question for everyone here.

01:07:23.730 --> 01:07:29.770
I wonder if anyone can name any
Black musical theater writers

01:07:29.770 --> 01:07:35.130
working early 20th
century, 1900 to 1930?

01:07:35.130 --> 01:07:36.930
Any guesses?

01:07:36.930 --> 01:07:39.920
[ Inaudible ]

01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:41.220
Yes.

01:07:41.220 --> 01:07:43.060
[ Inaudible ]

01:07:43.060 --> 01:07:44.790
Yes, Colin Johnson for sure.

01:07:44.790 --> 01:07:46.430
Yes, awesome.

01:07:46.430 --> 01:07:52.410
Great. So there were actually
quite a few Black writers

01:07:52.410 --> 01:07:55.250
working on Broadway in
the early 20th century,

01:07:55.250 --> 01:07:56.550
relatively speaking.

01:07:56.550 --> 01:07:59.510
Certainly the form was still
dominated by White men.

01:07:59.510 --> 01:08:02.280
But there were a tremendous
number of Black artists.

01:08:02.280 --> 01:08:05.210
I'll point out Bob
Cole who you mentioned,

01:08:05.210 --> 01:08:08.400
who I consider the father
of Black musical theater.

01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:13.490
He is - he devised what is
considered the first full length

01:08:13.490 --> 01:08:17.690
legitimate Black musical
comedy, A Trip to Coon Town.

01:08:17.690 --> 01:08:22.200
This was in 1897 and that is
the Coon Town that we reference

01:08:22.200 --> 01:08:24.870
in our 45 Minutes
from Coon Town title.

01:08:24.870 --> 01:08:29.130
And I'll also mention at the
top there, James P. Johnson

01:08:29.130 --> 01:08:31.410
and then toward the
middle Cecil Mack

01:08:31.410 --> 01:08:33.340
because they wrote
the Charleston,

01:08:33.340 --> 01:08:34.770
which you heard earlier.

01:08:34.770 --> 01:08:38.130
And that was from
1923, which you pointed

01:08:38.130 --> 01:08:41.920
out from a Black musical
called Running Wild.

01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:45.460
And then from the Black
author section we jump right

01:08:45.460 --> 01:08:48.370
into female writers
and so again I wonder,

01:08:48.370 --> 01:08:53.120
can anyone name any female
musical theater writers working

01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:56.540
early 20th century,
1900's to 1930?

01:08:56.540 --> 01:08:58.840
Any guesses?

01:09:02.040 --> 01:09:03.880
There were also quite a
number of women working.

01:09:03.880 --> 01:09:07.000
Dorothy Fields, I
think you probably -

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.120
if you don't know the name,
you probably know her work.

01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:12.140
I can't give you anything but
Love Baby, on the Sunny Side

01:09:12.140 --> 01:09:15.200
of the Street, a
number of pop standards.

01:09:15.200 --> 01:09:18.590
I want to also call attention
to Alma Sanders who is

01:09:18.590 --> 01:09:23.120
at the bottom right
of the screen.

01:09:23.120 --> 01:09:26.140
Because her, a bit
of her story speaks

01:09:26.140 --> 01:09:30.550
to how essentially the social
dynamics are informing the

01:09:30.550 --> 01:09:31.990
American musical.

01:09:31.990 --> 01:09:35.330
She eventually moved to New
York, but was actually living

01:09:35.330 --> 01:09:38.480
in Detroit when she
began her career.

01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:40.770
She would eventually
marry her lyricist,

01:09:40.770 --> 01:09:42.070
her lyric writing partner.

01:09:42.070 --> 01:09:43.920
He would be her second husband.

01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:46.190
She was married to her first
husband at the time though

01:09:46.190 --> 01:09:50.010
in Detroit, who wanted to
get a divorce from her.

01:09:50.010 --> 01:09:53.230
And she was on the
cusp of breaking

01:09:53.230 --> 01:09:54.770
through in the musical theater.

01:09:54.770 --> 01:09:57.670
She would go on to write a
handful of shows in the 20's

01:09:57.670 --> 01:10:01.090
and in 1921 is when
the divorce happened.

01:10:01.090 --> 01:10:07.440
So I'll read, this is from the
Detroit Free Press March 1921.

01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:11.610
"Ernest E. Benjamin was
granted a divorce from his wife,

01:10:11.610 --> 01:10:14.540
the well-known song
writer Alma Sanders.

01:10:14.540 --> 01:10:17.500
Benjamin testified
that his wife's success

01:10:17.500 --> 01:10:21.120
in writing two song
hits turned her head.

01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:23.510
And she refused to
keep house any longer.

01:10:23.510 --> 01:10:26.810
[ Laughter ]

01:10:26.810 --> 01:10:29.360
Or, to live in Detroit.

01:10:31.880 --> 01:10:35.970
He said she spent much of
her time in New York coming

01:10:35.970 --> 01:10:38.690
and going as she pleased."

01:10:38.690 --> 01:10:42.660
So that's just a fun little bit.

01:10:42.660 --> 01:10:44.740
I'm in the midst of writing
the women's show right now,

01:10:44.740 --> 01:10:46.040
we start readings next week.

01:10:46.040 --> 01:10:48.820
So I enjoy her story.

01:10:48.820 --> 01:10:54.870
And so then, from female
writers we cap this jazz

01:10:54.870 --> 01:10:58.340
and sociopolitical sequence
with prohibition blues

01:10:58.340 --> 01:11:01.190
and we get there - again
we're early 20th century;

01:11:01.190 --> 01:11:05.530
so that's women's right to
vote being ratified in 1920,

01:11:05.530 --> 01:11:08.070
also income tax and prohibition.

01:11:08.070 --> 01:11:10.880
So again, prohibition
blues brings us back

01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:12.540
to the jazz vernacular.

01:11:12.540 --> 01:11:16.300
We'll play the prohibition
blues clip now and then I'll pop

01:11:16.300 --> 01:11:19.080
up the script page for
it immediately after.

01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:23.510
So, this is prohibition blues.

01:11:23.510 --> 01:12:48.510
[ Music ]

01:12:48.510 --> 01:12:51.620
[ Applause ]

01:12:51.620 --> 01:12:54.830
And I just want to
mention again, the music is

01:12:54.830 --> 01:12:56.140
by Nora Bayes who is one

01:12:56.140 --> 01:13:00.020
of the first female
musical theater composers,

01:13:00.020 --> 01:13:01.810
who I happen to love.

01:13:01.810 --> 01:13:05.470
She was a very big
vaudeville and stage star.

01:13:05.470 --> 01:13:07.940
And so here's just a quick
look at the script page

01:13:07.940 --> 01:13:09.520
for prohibition blues.

01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:11.940
Again you'll see we cap the idea

01:13:11.940 --> 01:13:13.950
of social consciousness
at the top.

01:13:13.950 --> 01:13:16.930
We go into prohibition blues,
again part of the language,

01:13:16.930 --> 01:13:20.640
the music will continue under
for a final quote about jazz

01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:23.630
to wrap up and come full
circle with this jazz sequence

01:13:23.630 --> 01:13:25.340
and then we move forward.

01:13:25.340 --> 01:13:29.500
Just in terms of using
the songs in the narrative

01:13:29.500 --> 01:13:32.430
and in telling the story these
two songs were used almost

01:13:32.430 --> 01:13:34.450
in their entirety, but
that's not the case

01:13:34.450 --> 01:13:35.750
with all of the songs.

01:13:35.750 --> 01:13:39.430
In some cases we use
just two or three lines,

01:13:39.430 --> 01:13:42.500
in some cases we just use a
chorus; so it really depends

01:13:42.500 --> 01:13:44.320
on the needs of the
specific moment

01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:47.410
and how the song is utilized
in the story telling.

01:13:47.410 --> 01:13:53.020
And with that I think
I have completed.

01:13:53.020 --> 01:13:58.350
So that is how essentially the
songs are used in the show.

01:13:58.350 --> 01:14:00.510
And thank you for your time.

01:14:00.510 --> 01:14:19.040
[ Applause ]

01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:20.910
&gt;&gt; Whitney Levandusky:
Thank you so much Ben.

01:14:20.910 --> 01:14:24.970
Before we go, there
is a fourth speaker

01:14:24.970 --> 01:14:27.300
that we were hoping
to have here today.

01:14:27.300 --> 01:14:32.550
I want to take a moment to
highlight a powerful example

01:14:32.550 --> 01:14:37.850
of how the use of public
domain works can help us better

01:14:37.850 --> 01:14:43.610
understand ourselves
and our current time.

01:14:43.610 --> 01:14:45.680
Nina's presentation highlighted

01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:49.540
for us the way documentarians
use the public domain

01:14:49.540 --> 01:14:52.480
to bring truth and
understanding to often difficult

01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:54.930
and painful experiences.

01:14:56.800 --> 01:14:59.450
We were hoping to
have Taina Caragol,

01:14:59.450 --> 01:15:02.680
Curator at the Smithsonian
National Portrait Gallery join

01:15:02.680 --> 01:15:05.360
us today to discuss
the works included

01:15:05.360 --> 01:15:10.490
in the recent exhibition,
Unseen our past in a new light,

01:15:10.490 --> 01:15:15.580
to highlight a similar
practice among visual artists.

01:15:15.580 --> 01:15:18.030
Unfortunately because of
the government shutdown,

01:15:18.030 --> 01:15:21.420
she is unable to participate
in the event today.

01:15:21.420 --> 01:15:25.020
Caragol co-curated with
Osman Naim the works

01:15:25.020 --> 01:15:30.120
of Ken Gonzalez Day and Titus
Kafar to product an exhibition

01:15:30.120 --> 01:15:33.820
that considers the intersections
between portraiture,

01:15:33.820 --> 01:15:37.810
nation building and
museum practice.

01:15:37.810 --> 01:15:39.690
A brief warning before we begin,

01:15:39.690 --> 01:15:43.840
the images that follow directly
content with America's history

01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:46.620
of slavery and lynching.

01:15:46.620 --> 01:15:50.030
Gonzalez Day photographs
historical objects,

01:15:50.030 --> 01:15:54.130
be they from archives or museums
and suggests new meanings

01:15:54.130 --> 01:15:56.490
for them by thoughtfully
altering their composition

01:15:56.490 --> 01:15:58.790
or display.

01:16:12.420 --> 01:16:16.640
Here we have two works from
his erased lynching series.

01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:21.180
This series Gonzalez Day tells
us was sparked in response

01:16:21.180 --> 01:16:25.130
to anti-immigration rhetoric
that directly led to an increase

01:16:25.130 --> 01:16:28.900
in vigilante activity
along the US/Mexican border

01:16:28.900 --> 01:16:31.370
in the early 2000's.

01:16:31.370 --> 01:16:35.840
Each image is a recasting
of lynching photograph

01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:40.960
that took place in the United
States between 1850 and 1942.

01:16:40.960 --> 01:16:46.800
Where Gonzalez Day rephotographs
the image and removes the victim

01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:50.190
and the hanging materials
from the composition.

01:16:50.190 --> 01:16:54.920
Gonzalez Day has researched and
uncovered 350 cases of lynching

01:16:54.920 --> 01:16:58.690
in the state of California
alone as detailed in his book,

01:16:58.690 --> 01:17:03.310
Lynching in the West,
1850 to 1935.

01:17:03.310 --> 01:17:07.420
As Caragol states, in
unseen's catalog rather

01:17:07.420 --> 01:17:10.660
than inflicting more
violence upon the victims,

01:17:10.660 --> 01:17:14.020
Gonzalez Day directs our
attention to perpetrators

01:17:14.020 --> 01:17:18.700
and bystanders to consider
mob violence nationwide,

01:17:18.700 --> 01:17:24.270
exposing the vulnerability of
African Americans, Latinos,

01:17:24.270 --> 01:17:29.100
Native Americans, Jews
and immigrant communities.

01:17:29.100 --> 01:17:33.100
Their absent bodies stand
for their untold histories

01:17:33.100 --> 01:17:37.160
against the myth of a White
Anglo American identity.

01:17:37.160 --> 01:17:43.600
Titus Kafar paints
in the tradition

01:17:43.600 --> 01:17:46.490
of Euro American
Colonial portraiture,

01:17:46.490 --> 01:17:50.290
but then adds a contemporary
layer that is often physical,

01:17:50.290 --> 01:17:55.060
such as cutting, shrouding
or smearing the canvas.

01:17:55.060 --> 01:17:57.300
Before us we have a
well-known portrait

01:17:57.300 --> 01:18:01.600
of Thomas Jefferson shrouding
or revealing the portrait

01:18:01.600 --> 01:18:04.280
of an enslaved Black woman.

01:18:04.280 --> 01:18:07.400
In Kafar's words, "This
portrait is at once

01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:10.380
about Sally Mae Hemmings
and Thomas Jefferson,

01:18:10.380 --> 01:18:15.100
as well as the many woman who's
liberty was taken from them.

01:18:15.100 --> 01:18:18.060
And whose tragic
relationships have been shrouded

01:18:18.060 --> 01:18:21.330
by historically inaccurate
narratives of deified men

01:18:21.330 --> 01:18:24.290
in positions of power."

01:18:24.290 --> 01:18:28.690
The process of hiding the known
and revealing the unknown,

01:18:28.690 --> 01:18:32.600
according to co-curator
Osma Naim makes us realize

01:18:32.600 --> 01:18:34.700
that history is complex.

01:18:34.700 --> 01:18:36.000
It's messy.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.470
And filled with many
different perspectives,

01:18:38.470 --> 01:18:40.510
and that ultimately
our understanding

01:18:40.510 --> 01:18:43.170
of the past is more
complete when more

01:18:43.170 --> 01:18:46.110
of our stories can be told.

01:18:46.110 --> 01:18:50.330
Both Gonzalez Day and Kafar
use public domain works

01:18:50.330 --> 01:18:54.760
to probe foundational myths
in order to reclaim a space

01:18:54.760 --> 01:18:57.570
for those left unseen.

01:18:57.570 --> 01:19:02.450
I would encourage you to seek
out both their works not only

01:19:02.450 --> 01:19:06.220
as an illustration of the power
of using the public domain,

01:19:06.220 --> 01:19:09.220
but also to challenge
how each of us sees

01:19:09.220 --> 01:19:14.240
and understands our place
in the United States.

01:19:14.240 --> 01:19:17.740
Now, we are essentially
out of time for today.

01:19:17.740 --> 01:19:20.420
But I would like to invite
anyone who wishes to stay

01:19:20.420 --> 01:19:26.510
after for an informer Q&amp;A with
our presenters and thank you.

01:19:26.510 --> 01:19:30.300
We will have Katie
Rowland bring us home.

01:19:31.510 --> 01:19:39.710
[ Applause ]

01:19:39.710 --> 01:19:41.630
&gt;&gt; Katie Rowland: Thank
you everyone and thank you

01:19:41.630 --> 01:19:44.860
for joining our celebration
of the Lifecycle of Copyright.

01:19:44.860 --> 01:19:47.560
As Whitney said we're going
to conclude our program now,

01:19:47.560 --> 01:19:48.930
thanking all of our panelists.

01:19:48.930 --> 01:19:52.520
If anyone would like to welcome
- join me in thanking them

01:19:52.520 --> 01:19:54.510
for their participation -

01:19:54.510 --> 01:20:03.060
[ Applause ]

01:20:03.060 --> 01:20:06.770
Thank you all and we're so happy
you could enjoy our celebration

01:20:06.770 --> 01:20:09.160
of the life cycle of
copyright with us.

01:20:09.160 --> 01:20:12.210
Until our next event
on April 25,

01:20:12.210 --> 01:20:15.320
which is about the world IP
day, about going for the gold

01:20:15.320 --> 01:20:17.140
in sports, we'll see you then.

01:20:17.140 --> 01:20:18.440
Thank you.
