00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:01.500
- [Instructor] In previous videos,

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:06.040
we had talked about the
1896 Supreme Court case,

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.610
Plessy versus Ferguson,

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.330
which is a good one to know in general

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:12.350
if you're studying United States history

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:14.380
and/or United States government.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.090
But this is where we got the principle

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:22.090
of separate but equal

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.280
where the Supreme Court said in 1896

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.460
that it was okay to have segregation.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.950
It was okay to separate
folks on a racial basis

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:34.120
as long as what they got was equal.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.670
This was a case around whether
it was unconstitutional

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.540
for an African-American in Louisiana

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.710
to have to sit in a separate
rail car from white passengers.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:44.750
Now, as you can imagine,

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.450
this idea of segregation
and separate but equal,

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.740
it was taken to justify racial segregation

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.720
in all walks of life,
including in schools.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.950
And what you see here is a
map of the United States,

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.300
and it's colored in by the
degree of school segregation,

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.300
educational segregation,
as we enter into the 1950s.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.350
And what you could see is
in these red states here,

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.620
which is for the most
part the Southern states,

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.540
it required the separation of races.

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.600
In the green states you see here

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.010
segregation was forbidden.

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.960
And in the yellow and blue
states it was kind of in between.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.930
The yellow states had no legislation,

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.410
and in the blue states it was limited.

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:29.910
It wasn't required.

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:31.590
And all of this comes to a head as we get

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.070
into the 1950s in Topeka, Kansas.

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.280
You have a situation where the NAACP

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.990
in coordination with 13 parents

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.310
tried to register
African-American students

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.720
into white schools in Topeka, Kansas.

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.640
The schools tried to prevent them,

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.510
and it eventually goes to the
United States Supreme Court

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.250
in the case of Brown
versus Board of Education

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.180
of Topeka 1954.

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.930
Oliver Brown was one of those 13 parents

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.160
trying to get his daughter

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.950
into an otherwise segregated school.

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.970
And this is a seminal Supreme Court case

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.900
because here the Supreme
Court revisits segregation

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.680
and essentially overturns
Plessy versus Ferguson.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.300
The Supreme Court, in
a unanimous decision,

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.300
ruled, We conclude that, in
the field of public education,

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.780
the doctrine of separate
but equal has no place.

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.690
Separate educational facilities
are inherently unequal.

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.510
Therefore, we hold that
the plaintiffs and others

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.780
similarly situated for whom
the actions have been brought

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.270
are, by reason of the
segregation complained of,

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:48.050
deprived of the equal
protection of the laws

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.730
guaranteed by the 14th Amendment.

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.560
And we cite the 14th Amendment

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.200
a lot in these Supreme Court cases.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.300
And it never hurts to take another look

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.560
at at least an excerpt
of the 14th Amendment.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.050
And this is a focus on the
equal protection clause.

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.890
This is part of Section
1 of the 14th Amendment.

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.970
Nor shall any State
deprive any person of life,

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.230
liberty, or property,
without due process of law.

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.750
And then this is the
equal protection clause.

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.788
Nor deny to any person
within its jurisdiction

00:03:15.788 --> 00:03:19.430
the equal protection of the laws.

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.500
And this is a big deal
because not only does it say

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.610
that hey, segregation is
fundamentally unconstitutional.

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:27.500
What's also interesting about this

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:28.970
is that this unanimous ruling

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:30.770
by the United States Supreme Court

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:34.150
then sets off a whole series of actions

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.020
by politicians from
those states that you saw

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:39.400
where segregation was mandatory

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.790
to try to go around the
Supreme Court's decision.

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.330
And so it's a case of how
other branches of government

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.480
might try to limit Supreme Court powers

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.440
or try to ignore, in some
cases, Supreme Court powers.

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.910
A good example of this was
Virginia Senator Harry Byrd.

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.250
In 1956, shortly after the Brown versus

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.250
Board of Education decision,

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.770
he issues the Southern Manifesto

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:08.920
where he gets 100 politicians in the South

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.630
to essentially sign on saying, hey,

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:14.150
we are going to do what
we can, legislatively,

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.300
to try to get around the Brown versus

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:19.320
Board of Education decision.

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.910
We are going to try to ensure

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:22.700
that that does not go into effect

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.460
in segregated states like Virginia.

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.240
And later that year, in 1956,

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.120
it took the form of this
massive resistance movement

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.870
where they had the Stanley Plan,

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.370
named after the Virginia governor

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.300
in which they started to pass laws

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.180
to try to make Brown
versus Board of Education

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.550
not take effect.

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:42.630
One of them, for example,

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.410
said that any school that
actually desegregated

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.680
would not receive state funds,

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.340
and it authorized the governor
to close those schools down.

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.730
And this massive resistance continued,

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:57.670
and it was challenged in the
courts all the way to 1959

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:00.030
where you actually have the
first integrated schools

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:01.280
in the state of Virginia.

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:05.350
Another state-level
challenge to the ruling

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.160
by the Supreme Court happened in 1957

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.960
where the governor of
Arkansas, Orval Faubus,

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.680
tried to actively prevent nine students,

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.670
nine African-American students,

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:20.940
from attending Little
Rock Central High School.

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:23.550
And so what you see in
this picture over here,

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:28.550
these are US Army troops
sent by President Eisenhower

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.390
to escort these nine students

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:33.890
into Little Rock Central High School.

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:35.680
These nine students are famously known

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.140
as the Little Rock Nine.

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:40.420
And this is actually a picture
of Governor Orval Faubus

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:43.500
later complaining about this intervention.

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.350
And this continues on for some time.

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:49.290
You fast forward to 1963.

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:52.820
This is Alabama Governor George Wallace

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:55.760
physically using himself to block

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:58.460
two African-American
students from registering

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.210
at the University of Alabama.

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:02.870
Once again, in this situation,

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:04.460
the president had to take action.

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:08.860
This time John F. Kennedy, he
federalized the National Guard

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:13.020
and he made them force
Governor Wallace to step aside

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:14.870
so that those students could register

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:17.200
at the University of Alabama.

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:18.530
So the big picture here is

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:20.570
that Brown versus Board of Education

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:24.110
is a seminal case in American history,

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:26.520
but it also tells us how
the legislative branch

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:30.810
and state government might
try to go around decisions

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:32.100
that they don't like.

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:34.120
Sometimes they might
just ignore the decision

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.270
until they're forced
to pay attention to it.

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:38.850
Or they might try to
legislate their way around it

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:40.610
and have a fight in the court system

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:43.453
until they're forced to
go one way or the other.
