00:00:00.031 --> 00:00:02.635
- In the 18th century you start to have

00:00:02.635 --> 00:00:04.893
significant interaction between

00:00:04.893 --> 00:00:06.033
the English and the Indians,

00:00:06.033 --> 00:00:08.783
especially in the East Indian Company.

00:00:08.783 --> 00:00:09.616
And as part of that,

00:00:09.616 --> 00:00:11.381
you start to have Western scholars start

00:00:11.381 --> 00:00:14.597
to really study Sanskrit and the Vedas.

00:00:14.597 --> 00:00:16.389
And as they do these,

00:00:16.389 --> 00:00:18.280
it starts to really open up their mind

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.735
not just to the roots of Sanskrit

00:00:20.735 --> 00:00:23.685
but also many of the Western languages

00:00:23.685 --> 00:00:25.779
including English itself.

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:28.822
So, this is a quote in 1786

00:00:28.822 --> 00:00:30.647
by the English philologist,

00:00:30.647 --> 00:00:32.331
someone who studies written languages

00:00:32.331 --> 00:00:33.773
especially from historical sources,

00:00:33.773 --> 00:00:35.287
Sir William Jones.

00:00:35.287 --> 00:00:38.015
He wrote, “The Sanskrit language,

00:00:38.015 --> 00:00:40.035
whatever be its antiquity,

00:00:40.035 --> 00:00:41.450
is of wonderful structure.

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:42.539
More perfect than the Greek,

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:44.070
more copious than the Latin,

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.746
and more exquisitely refine than either,

00:00:46.746 --> 00:00:50.368
yet bearing to both of
them a stronger affinity

00:00:50.368 --> 00:00:51.849
both in the roots of the verbs

00:00:51.849 --> 00:00:52.781
and in the forms of grammar,

00:00:52.781 --> 00:00:56.462
than could not possibly have
been produced by accident...”

00:00:56.462 --> 00:00:57.831
Let me underline that.

00:00:57.831 --> 00:01:00.632
“…than could not possibly have
been produced by accident.”

00:01:00.632 --> 00:01:02.418
So he says there’s a lot of commonality

00:01:02.418 --> 00:01:04.520
between the Sanskrit and Latin and Greek,

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:06.251
and it’s a strong affinity,

00:01:06.251 --> 00:01:07.239
a strong connectedness

00:01:07.239 --> 00:01:09.522
that could not have produced by accident.

00:01:09.522 --> 00:01:10.454
So strong indeed,

00:01:10.454 --> 00:01:13.378
that no philologer could examine all three

00:01:13.378 --> 00:01:15.476
without believing them to have sprung

00:01:15.476 --> 00:01:17.497
from some common source."

00:01:17.497 --> 00:01:18.868
Let me underline that.

00:01:18.868 --> 00:01:20.647
“Without believing them to have sprung

00:01:20.647 --> 00:01:22.616
from some common source which,

00:01:22.616 --> 00:01:24.355
perhaps no longer exists;

00:01:24.355 --> 00:01:27.954
there is a similar reason
though not quit so forcible

00:01:27.954 --> 00:01:31.282
for supposing that both
the Gothic and the Celtic,

00:01:31.282 --> 00:01:33.648
though blended with a very different idiom

00:01:33.648 --> 00:01:35.882
had the same origin with the Sanskrit;

00:01:35.882 --> 00:01:39.369
and the old Persian might be
added to the same family.”

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:41.774
And so when they started
to study the Vedas

00:01:41.774 --> 00:01:42.607
and look at the Sanskrit,

00:01:42.607 --> 00:01:43.647
they started to realize

00:01:43.647 --> 00:01:46.159
well maybe all of these
languages are connected.

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:48.377
And now modern day philologists

00:01:48.377 --> 00:01:51.779
believe this very strongly
the more they have studied it.

00:01:51.779 --> 00:01:54.042
Based on the connections and the grammar

00:01:54.042 --> 00:01:56.807
and even the vocabulary and
the word structure themselves,

00:01:56.807 --> 00:02:00.334
they now theorize that a parent language

00:02:00.334 --> 00:02:02.626
of Sanskrit, Latin,

00:02:02.626 --> 00:02:04.801
and the Germanic languages

00:02:04.801 --> 00:02:06.165
and the Celtic languages

00:02:06.165 --> 00:02:08.925
recall a language today
called Proto-Indo–European,

00:02:08.925 --> 00:02:10.848
which is a lost language.

00:02:10.848 --> 00:02:14.236
But we think that Sanskrit
is one of the oldest…

00:02:14.236 --> 00:02:17.026
Is one of the oldest
evidences that we have

00:02:17.026 --> 00:02:20.109
of that Proto-Indo-European Language.

00:02:21.343 --> 00:02:24.040
Sanskrit as of course the parent language

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.909
has evolved in different parts of Indian

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:29.157
to languages like Hindi,
Bengali, and Punjabi.

00:02:29.157 --> 00:02:32.291
Latin, which is also a dead language now,

00:02:32.291 --> 00:02:34.521
has evolved into languages like

00:02:34.521 --> 00:02:36.796
Spanish, Italian, and French.

00:02:36.796 --> 00:02:38.090
And English

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.947
which is considered a Germanic
language structurally,

00:02:40.947 --> 00:02:44.092
but has significant influence
from Latin and French,

00:02:44.092 --> 00:02:49.004
they all come from that same
Proto-Indo-European root.

00:02:49.004 --> 00:02:51.092
And just to get an appreciation

00:02:51.092 --> 00:02:53.498
for why these philologist believe this,

00:02:53.498 --> 00:02:55.451
and this is something when I first saw it,

00:02:55.451 --> 00:02:57.777
really blew my mind a little bit.

00:02:57.777 --> 00:03:00.776
I’ll show you some connections
between Sanskrit words,

00:03:00.776 --> 00:03:01.890
and those of you who might be

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.013
Hindi, Bengali or Punjabi speakers,

00:03:04.013 --> 00:03:06.315
or any of these North
Indian languages in India,

00:03:06.315 --> 00:03:08.173
will see the connection to Sanskrit.

00:03:08.173 --> 00:03:09.464
But what’s amazing is

00:03:09.464 --> 00:03:12.480
how these words are connected to Latin

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.080
and many of the languages
derived from Latin.

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.289
Some of your Persian speakers

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:17.756
might recognize some,

00:03:17.756 --> 00:03:19.148
some commonalities

00:03:19.148 --> 00:03:20.382
and, most importantly,

00:03:20.382 --> 00:03:21.517
the language that we
are speaking right now,

00:03:21.517 --> 00:03:23.513
how to relate it to English.

00:03:23.513 --> 00:03:27.440
And here is just a sample
of some Sanskrit words

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.516
that have an eerie resemblance

00:03:29.516 --> 00:03:32.241
to both English and in
some cases Latin words.

00:03:32.241 --> 00:03:33.433
Or many cases Latin words.

00:03:33.433 --> 00:03:35.333
I’ve just given Latin in a few of them.

00:03:35.333 --> 00:03:37.891
So the Sanskrit matr,

00:03:37.891 --> 00:03:39.673
well in English we have mother

00:03:39.673 --> 00:03:41.325
and in Latin we have mater.

00:03:41.325 --> 00:03:43.887
And we also from Latin
in English via Latin,

00:03:43.887 --> 00:03:46.539
we have words like maternity and maternal

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:49.546
all referring to the
same idea of motherhood.

00:03:49.546 --> 00:03:51.072
And this general trend,

00:03:51.072 --> 00:03:53.712
this t sound, matr or mater

00:03:53.712 --> 00:03:56.324
becoming of more of a tha sound in English

00:03:56.324 --> 00:03:57.281
and the Germanic languages

00:03:57.281 --> 00:03:59.340
is a trend you’ll see over and over again.

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.645
In Sanskrit you have pithr,

00:04:01.645 --> 00:04:04.308
in Latin you have pater,

00:04:04.308 --> 00:04:06.782
and by way of Latin in modern English

00:04:06.782 --> 00:04:09.753
we have words like paternity and paternal.

00:04:09.753 --> 00:04:11.951
But going through the Germanic languages

00:04:11.951 --> 00:04:14.314
you have once again that tha sound

00:04:14.314 --> 00:04:16.055
becoming more of a tha sound.

00:04:16.055 --> 00:04:18.748
And you also see this
pattern as you go from

00:04:18.748 --> 00:04:20.569
this Proto-Indo-European,

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:21.402
this theoretical language,

00:04:21.402 --> 00:04:24.599
and especially if you think
about relative to Sanskrit,

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:26.816
that you have the sound going from

00:04:26.816 --> 00:04:29.730
a pa to a fa as you go to
the Germanic languages.

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:33.412
So pithr becomes, you
could say it father.

00:04:33.412 --> 00:04:34.379
And other words.

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:37.870
Na in Sanskrit…and those of you who speak

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.663
Hindi or Bengali would
recognize that of course,

00:04:40.663 --> 00:04:42.980
and in English it is no.

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:44.498
Gau which is still,

00:04:44.498 --> 00:04:46.716
it’s a Hindi word for cow,

00:04:46.716 --> 00:04:48.162
in English it’s cow.

00:04:48.162 --> 00:04:49.454
Gau , cow.

00:04:49.454 --> 00:04:51.098
Naama,name.

00:04:51.098 --> 00:04:52.915
In Latin nomen.

00:04:52.915 --> 00:04:54.476
Dwar, door.

00:04:54.476 --> 00:04:56.210
This one I thought was really interesting.

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:57.073
I didn’t know this until I started

00:04:57.073 --> 00:04:59.044
looking it up a little bit.

00:04:59.044 --> 00:05:02.711
Anamika is Sanskrit,
and it means anonymous.

00:05:04.003 --> 00:05:06.995
Kaal, which is referring
to time in Sanskrit

00:05:06.995 --> 00:05:09.965
and in modern Sanskrit drive languages

00:05:09.965 --> 00:05:11.365
like Hindi and Bengali

00:05:11.365 --> 00:05:14.052
it’s referring to references in time;

00:05:14.052 --> 00:05:15.209
tomorrow, yesterday.

00:05:15.209 --> 00:05:17.789
And in English you have calendar.

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:20.140
Naas and in something like,

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:24.145
in modern languages in the
sub-continent and you have naas,

00:05:24.145 --> 00:05:26.167
and in English you have nose.

00:05:26.167 --> 00:05:27.750
Loc in...in English

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:30.926
you have the prefix loc,

00:05:30.926 --> 00:05:33.498
as in location or locate.

00:05:33.498 --> 00:05:35.361
And then this is of
course a very nice one,

00:05:35.361 --> 00:05:38.437
Sanskrit lubh, which means desire,

00:05:38.437 --> 00:05:41.867
well in English we have the word love.

00:05:41.867 --> 00:05:43.266
And this is just a sample,

00:05:43.266 --> 00:05:44.561
I encourage you to look it up more,

00:05:44.561 --> 00:05:46.757
you’ll be amazed by the connections

00:05:46.757 --> 00:05:48.771
between Sanskrit and English.

00:05:48.771 --> 00:05:50.137
And now I'm going to show you

00:05:50.137 --> 00:05:51.235
what I think is one of the coolest,

00:05:51.235 --> 00:05:53.643
because it isn’t just a
linguistic connection,

00:05:53.643 --> 00:05:55.087
but it is also a,

00:05:55.087 --> 00:05:57.974
I guess you could say
spiritual connection.

00:05:57.974 --> 00:05:59.724
And this is the names

00:06:00.633 --> 00:06:04.716
for the sky god from
several different traditions

00:06:05.579 --> 00:06:09.951
So in the Vedas they
make reference to a god,

00:06:09.951 --> 00:06:14.342
Dyauspithr, and it’s
literally referring to

00:06:14.342 --> 00:06:15.352
Dyaus,

00:06:15.352 --> 00:06:16.769
referring to sky.

00:06:17.847 --> 00:06:19.715
And we already talked about Pithr

00:06:19.715 --> 00:06:21.172
been the word for father.

00:06:21.172 --> 00:06:25.590
So it’s referring to
this idea of sky father.

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:27.421
And some of you might be
getting goosebumps now

00:06:27.421 --> 00:06:29.516
when you see where this is going.

00:06:29.516 --> 00:06:32.415
Well, in Greek we have
a very similar word,

00:06:32.415 --> 00:06:34.055
instead of Dyaus we have Zeus

00:06:34.055 --> 00:06:35.506
and those are very similar words.

00:06:35.506 --> 00:06:36.423
The spelling might be different,

00:06:36.423 --> 00:06:38.036
but with the way it
comes out of your mouth

00:06:38.036 --> 00:06:39.555
is very similar.

00:06:39.555 --> 00:06:41.369
Dyaus, Dyaus,

00:06:41.369 --> 00:06:42.340
Zeus,

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:44.117
instead of Pithr you have Pater,

00:06:44.117 --> 00:06:46.117
once again you have sky,

00:06:47.685 --> 00:06:49.352
you have sky father,

00:06:50.762 --> 00:06:52.907
sky father right over here.

00:06:52.907 --> 00:06:54.315
And this is another connection

00:06:54.315 --> 00:06:55.148
that blew my mind.

00:06:55.148 --> 00:06:56.873
It wasn’t obvious when I first saw it,

00:06:56.873 --> 00:06:58.611
but Jupiter from Latin,

00:06:58.611 --> 00:06:59.809
the Roman god,

00:06:59.809 --> 00:07:01.414
you could use Jupiter.

00:07:01.414 --> 00:07:04.293
This is once again instead
of Zeus you have Dyau,

00:07:04.293 --> 00:07:06.933
instead of Pater you have Pitr.

00:07:06.933 --> 00:07:09.860
So, instead of Dyauspitr you have Jupiter.

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:12.010
Dyauspitr, Jupiter.

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:13.794
These are very very similar words

00:07:13.794 --> 00:07:15.519
even though the spelling seems different,

00:07:15.519 --> 00:07:17.527
the way it comes out of your mouth

00:07:17.527 --> 00:07:20.334
is very very very very very close.

00:07:20.334 --> 00:07:23.465
And this is further
evidence for the closeness

00:07:23.465 --> 00:07:26.132
between Sanskrit, between Greek,

00:07:27.014 --> 00:07:29.181
and between Latin.

00:07:29.181 --> 00:07:32.040
So once again, we have sky father.

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:33.478
And this of course an image of…

00:07:33.478 --> 00:07:35.745
well it’s hard to tell whether
that’s Jupiter or Zeus.

00:07:35.745 --> 00:07:37.406
I believe that is a picture of Jupiter.

00:07:37.406 --> 00:07:39.567
And what’s also interesting is,

00:07:39.567 --> 00:07:41.260
the Vedas sight

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:42.093
Dyauspitr

00:07:43.309 --> 00:07:45.436
as the father of Indra.

00:07:45.436 --> 00:07:47.485
Who’s considered the King of the gods.

00:07:47.485 --> 00:07:48.925
One of the most significant,

00:07:48.925 --> 00:07:51.190
if not the most significant
god in Hinduism.

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:52.675
And Indra is now in,

00:07:52.675 --> 00:07:54.326
especially in the Vedas,

00:07:54.326 --> 00:07:57.275
and this is the most spoken
about god in the Vedas,

00:07:57.275 --> 00:07:59.112
Has many of the of the qualities

00:07:59.112 --> 00:08:02.537
that we now in Greek and Roman traditions

00:08:02.537 --> 00:08:05.286
associate with Zeus and Jupiter.

00:08:05.286 --> 00:08:06.892
Indra is a sky god,

00:08:06.892 --> 00:08:08.175
throws bolts of lightning.

00:08:08.175 --> 00:08:12.152
Actually eerie similarity
with the Nordic god of Thor.

00:08:12.152 --> 00:08:16.367
Where Nordic people were
also Indo-European people.

00:08:16.367 --> 00:08:18.433
Where Indra he throws a hammer

00:08:18.433 --> 00:08:20.028
and he defeats these monsters.

00:08:20.028 --> 00:08:22.540
And all of these things,
very similar to Thor.

00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:23.781
So hopefully these…

00:08:23.781 --> 00:08:24.838
You know when I first learn this,

00:08:24.838 --> 00:08:27.618
it just kind of made me realize
how connected the world is,

00:08:27.618 --> 00:08:29.734
and it started to make me
start to look for patterns

00:08:29.734 --> 00:08:31.215
where I hadn’t seen them before.

00:08:31.215 --> 00:08:35.007
And it really shows
how these civilizations

00:08:35.007 --> 00:08:37.340
that seemed very unconnected

00:08:38.637 --> 00:08:39.511
might have,

00:08:39.511 --> 00:08:41.165
and probably we do believe

00:08:41.165 --> 00:08:44.088
emerged and (mumbles)

00:08:44.088 --> 00:08:46.393
emerged from the same place.

00:08:46.393 --> 00:08:49.524
Modern philologists and historian

00:08:49.524 --> 00:08:51.704
believe that this Proto-Indo-European

00:08:51.704 --> 00:08:54.547
might have been spoken by
people in the Caucuses.

00:08:54.547 --> 00:08:57.828
The word Caucasian is referring
really to these people

00:08:57.828 --> 00:08:59.864
from that Caucuses area there,

00:08:59.864 --> 00:09:01.028
but we don’t know for sure.

00:09:01.028 --> 00:09:03.595
And we believe that they migrated out.

00:09:03.595 --> 00:09:06.602
And so when we talk
about the Germanic tribes

00:09:06.602 --> 00:09:07.671
going into Northern Europe.

00:09:07.671 --> 00:09:09.463
The Celtic tribes going into,

00:09:09.463 --> 00:09:12.886
I guess you could say
North South Central Europe.

00:09:12.886 --> 00:09:14.918
You could talk about the Italic,

00:09:14.918 --> 00:09:16.094
the Latin tribes,

00:09:16.094 --> 00:09:18.076
you could talk about the Greek tribes,

00:09:18.076 --> 00:09:19.649
and you could also talk about the In…

00:09:19.649 --> 00:09:22.022
you could also talk
about Indo-Aryan tribes

00:09:22.022 --> 00:09:24.298
which eventually would settle into Persia

00:09:24.298 --> 00:09:25.662
and into Northern India.

00:09:25.662 --> 00:09:28.579
These we believe are all connected.
