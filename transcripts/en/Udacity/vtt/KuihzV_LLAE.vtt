00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:04.014
Now we've finished adding the code to create our

00:00:04.014 --> 00:00:08.150
author-driven narrative by animating the World Cup.

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:12.910
Now I want to enable the reader to be able to drill down further into our

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.950
data by using D3's event binding to enable interaction.

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.410
While it's great to see the year's animates by us.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.940
In succession it's very hard to compare one year to the next.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.760
Especially if they may not be sequential.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.190
For example, if I want to compare what happened in 1930 with the world cup

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.160
with what happened in 2014 in Brazil.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.200
I would have to wait for

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.240
the animation to go through, or dig into the data myself.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:49.120
To remedy this, I want to add some buttons that correspond to all the years of

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.710
the World Cup, where if a user clicks on one it jumps to

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.370
that individual year and updates the map.

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.250
In this case,

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:02.560
we're going to be adding some div elements based on the years of the World Cup.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.489
To start, we're simply selecting the body.

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.030
Appending a parent div with class years button, which is then

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.370
going to contain 20 elements corresponding to every year of the World Cup
