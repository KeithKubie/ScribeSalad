00:00:08.347 --> 00:00:11.640
SPEAKER: Thanks for joining us
at this Talks at Google event,

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.590
everyone here and
on the live stream

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.880
and watching the
video recording.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.180
We're lucky to be joined
today by Jordan Harbinger.

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:20.160
Some applause, please.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.118
JORDAN HARBINGER: Yeah.

00:00:21.118 --> 00:00:22.187
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:22.187 --> 00:00:23.270
SPEAKER: I missed the cue.

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:25.519
JORDAN HARBINGER: When you
force it, it means so much.

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:27.020
SPEAKER: Means a
lot, means a lot.

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.720
So Jordan, he's the host
of the successful podcast,

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.260
"The Art of Charm," which
focuses on psychology,

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.660
performance, life, and success.

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.150
And he's brought a wide range
of people onto the show,

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.060
from celebrities, to
subject matter experts

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:42.946
in the sciences and the arts.

00:00:42.946 --> 00:00:44.570
He recently had Neil
deGrasse Tyson on,

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.095
which was a pretty awesome
episode, I might say.

00:00:47.095 --> 00:00:48.754
Definitely check that one out.

00:00:48.754 --> 00:00:50.420
And he's going to be
talking to us today

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.760
about building relationships
and social capital,

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.430
so some very interesting stuff.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.440
And if we have time, we
might hear a little bit

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.560
about a story of how he
was kidnapped in Serbia.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.257
So we'll just leave that
to be expanded further.

00:01:04.257 --> 00:01:05.840
So without further
ado, here's Jordan.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.423
JORDAN HARBINGER:
Thank you very much.

00:01:07.423 --> 00:01:09.280
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.729
Good, the second
round, everybody

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:12.020
was on point with the applause.

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.092
I appreciate that a lot.

00:01:14.092 --> 00:01:15.800
It's great to be
speaking here at Google.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.049
It's great to be speaking
in front of a room of people

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:19.070
at all.

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.770
Because a few short years
ago, I was extremely shy.

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.750
Actually, shy is not even a
word for it, actually at all.

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.310
It was more like
crippling anxiety.

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.850
Especially as a kid, I
hated being in school.

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:33.567
I hated being
around other people.

00:01:33.567 --> 00:01:35.900
I don't know, something like,
they're all looking at me.

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.940
I'm sure one or two
of you in the audience

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.920
have seen or felt like that
at some point in your life,

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.560
especially when you're younger.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.420
And so I started
skipping school a lot.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.460
And it went a little
something like this.

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.360
Get up, get dressed, get
on the bus, go to school,

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.540
and then immediately show
up for maybe one class,

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.660
or try to show up for a few
classes, or just turn around

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:00.376
and walk home.

00:02:00.376 --> 00:02:02.000
And it wasn't the
cool kind of skipping

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.520
school where you're going
to fancy restaurants

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.061
and dancing on parade
floats like Ferris Bueller,

00:02:07.061 --> 00:02:09.560
but the kind of skipping school
where your parents come home

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.480
at 4 PM or 5 PM and
find you playing

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.860
video games in your underwear.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.420
So that system, the education
thing, the formal education

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.630
thing really wasn't
working for me at all.

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.190
And I started to
get my act together

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.650
a little bit when I was
older, in high school/college.

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.670
And I graduated from the
University of Michigan

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:29.720
undergrad.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.120
And my friends all had
bright futures ahead of them.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.860
They were going to
work at AOL, which

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.880
was a big deal at that point
in time, right, heard of that?

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.760
And other people were working
in finance and things like that,

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.810
and buying their newly back
in fashion acid wash jeans,

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.550
and heading off to New York.

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:48.770
And I wasn't really sure
what I wanted to do.

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.110
I needed a little bit more
time to figure it out.

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.651
I'm sure we've all
heard that phrase,

00:02:52.651 --> 00:02:55.350
or used that phrase
before as well.

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.160
And so one day, I got
up bright and early,

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.580
because I needed a new Discman,
the one with anti-skip,

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.325
because when you're
rollerblading,

00:03:03.325 --> 00:03:04.200
that's what you need.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.730
Otherwise it bumps around
all over the place.

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.646
And I think I just ripped
space-time with that

00:03:07.646 --> 00:03:09.050
'98 reference there.

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:10.670
But you need to
have the mega bass.

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.140
You need to have the anti-skip.

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.579
And frankly, 2 PM was
about the time I rolled in.

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:16.370
Because it was college,
so bright and early

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:17.840
is a relative term.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.360
But I started talking with the
guy that worked at Best Buy.

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.784
And he said you know a
lot about this stuff, what

00:03:22.784 --> 00:03:23.950
are you doing after college?

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.180
And I thought, well,
you're looking at it, man.

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.617
This is what I'm
doing right now,

00:03:27.617 --> 00:03:29.450
and maybe I should work
here for the summer.

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:30.740
I know how to fix computers.

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:31.989
I know how to build computers.

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:33.890
I can install software,
remove software.

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:37.550
This is the late '90s or early
2000s at this point, I think.

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.130
And this is a perfect
job for me, right?

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.080
I can easily fall
into this field.

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:44.990
And he said, slow
your roll, man.

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:48.800
You have to work selling
music, CDs, and things

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.890
like that, the remnants of the
cassette section at Best Buy,

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:55.760
before you can move up to
computer repair and customer

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:56.750
service.

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.210
So all my friends with
their bright futures--

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:02.390
I saw my bright future
go down the toilet

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:05.599
in front of a life-sized
cut out of Britney Spears.

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:07.140
So that system wasn't
working for me,

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.240
still not working for me.

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.240
And I did what a
lot of people do

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:14.820
when they run out of
career options entirely

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.470
and they're backed
against the wall

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:21.250
and they feel like they have no
future, and I became a lawyer.

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:25.180
And so of course, I'm stuck
in law school thinking, OK,

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:26.940
this just bought me
three more years.

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:27.900
Good plan.

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.800
Everybody says you
can get a great job

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.091
once you get out of law school.

00:04:31.091 --> 00:04:33.390
This is for sure going to be
a winning strategy for me.

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:35.730
And I really felt out of
place most of the time,

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:37.320
if not the entire time.

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.781
I felt out of place the
vast majority of the time.

00:04:39.781 --> 00:04:41.280
And that's called
imposter syndrome,

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.800
and pretty much
everybody has this.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.570
I don't know how you felt when
you got hired here at Google.

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:48.240
And everywhere that I go speak,
there's always some measure

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.281
of people-- and we won't
even do a show of hands,

00:04:50.281 --> 00:04:52.410
because it's so predictable
every single time--

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:54.576
there's always some measure
of people, the majority,

00:04:54.576 --> 00:04:57.840
in fact, who think that they're
the group or the person that

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.390
slipped through the cracks,
and that at some point,

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:01.830
they're going to get found
out, that they don't really

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.746
know what they're doing,
or they're not really

00:05:03.746 --> 00:05:05.700
as talented as everybody
else in the room.

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.408
And it's only a matter
of time until they

00:05:07.408 --> 00:05:10.200
get found out, and
possibly or likely fired.

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.240
And that is what
I had in my head

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.490
when I started working
on Wall Street.

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:17.310
Now, the guy who hired
me, his name was Dave.

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:18.600
And Dave was cool.

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.990
And no lawyers
were cool, really.

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:22.530
And that's kind
of a general rule,

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:24.660
but especially at
this particular firm,

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:26.070
there weren't a
whole lot of guys

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:27.750
that were doing finance
that were really

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:29.040
well-respected by everybody.

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.260
And everybody thought
Dave was just the man.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.080
And he was a guy from
Brooklyn, and he had a tan.

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.915
So obviously, he knew something
that other people did not know.

00:05:37.915 --> 00:05:40.290
When you're from Brooklyn and
you have a tan, take notes,

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:40.690
right?

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:42.273
Everybody needs to
take notes on that.

00:05:42.273 --> 00:05:45.032
And this guy was never
in the office, ever.

00:05:45.032 --> 00:05:47.490
And if there's something that
you might know about lawyers,

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:49.920
it's that they bill in
six-minute increments

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:50.820
generally.

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:52.620
And this is what they're
doing when they're

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:54.810
in every phase of
their work day,

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:57.000
they're billing in these
little increments of time.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.690
So they stay in the office
all day, oftentimes all night.

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:03.780
And everybody was working
all the time, especially

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:07.270
on Wall Street in 2007-2008.

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:11.336
One time I went up to my office
on a Saturday night, maybe even

00:06:11.336 --> 00:06:13.210
a Friday night, to show
it off to my friends.

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:14.890
This is probably my
first month on the job.

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:16.480
And I thought, I'm going to
go up in this big Manhattan

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.299
skyscraper, open up
a bottle of whisky.

00:06:18.299 --> 00:06:19.840
We're going to hang
out in my office,

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.075
and talk about how we all
finally made it to New York

00:06:22.075 --> 00:06:23.540
and we're doing really well.

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:25.480
And when I opened
the elevator door

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:28.180
on the 42nd floor of
World Financial Number 2,

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:30.370
the place looked
like Monday morning.

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:31.600
Everybody was in there.

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:34.210
I'm talking everybody,
except for our summer

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:35.950
class, which is what I was in.

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:37.450
All the partners were there.

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:40.080
All of the associates,
junior and senior were there.

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:41.710
They were closing
some deal, and it

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:43.519
was kind of a normal situation.

00:06:43.519 --> 00:06:44.810
I didn't know that at the time.

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:46.210
I actually went back
in the elevator,

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:48.100
pushed the ground floor button,
and got the hell out of there,

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:50.183
obviously, as fast as I
could, before they gave me

00:06:50.183 --> 00:06:52.480
some paperwork or some
documents to review.

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:53.980
Because I wanted
to continue my life

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:55.560
and my evening and my weekend.

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:57.490
But what ended up being
really frightening

00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:59.740
was when I went back to
work on Monday morning,

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:01.870
I asked a senior
associate, what's the deal?

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:05.380
Why are there so many people
in the office on a weekend?

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:07.120
Are we closing a big deal?

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:08.789
Or we short-staffed?

00:07:08.789 --> 00:07:09.580
What's the problem?

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:12.840
And he said, no man, we're
always here at this time.

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:15.550
There's not a weekend that goes
by that we're not here 10:00

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:17.924
PM, 11:00 PM, 1:00-2:00
in the morning.

00:07:17.924 --> 00:07:19.840
If there's any work to
be had, we're doing it.

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:22.630
I mean, we bill in
six-minute increments.

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:25.310
There's one guy that wasn't
there, besides me of course.

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:26.710
Dave was not there.

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:28.060
Dave was nowhere to be found.

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:30.690
Dave wasn't there at
2:00 AM on a Saturday,

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:33.710
and he certainly wasn't there
at 2:00 PM on a Tuesday.

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:36.550
And this was so confusing to me.

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:40.300
And luckily, Dave was assigned
by HR to be my mentor,

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:43.750
and not the kind of mentor
where it's like, oh,

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:45.940
we're on the top floor,
doing oyster shooters

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:48.670
with Matthew McConaughey like
on "Wolf of Wall Street."

00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:50.050
Not that kind of mentor.

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:51.550
This is the kind
of mentor where HR

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:53.470
is like, you have to
hang out with this guy

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:57.790
twice, check the boxes when you
do so that we know you mentored

00:07:57.790 --> 00:08:00.256
this person during the summer.

00:08:00.256 --> 00:08:02.380
And he was thrilled about
it, as you might imagine.

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:05.320
Everybody else that was on
this mentorship program that

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:08.460
was in the law firm was
going to see Blue Man Group,

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:10.210
to put a little bit
of a time stamp on it.

00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:15.130
To go out for drinks and
have $190 seafood lunches.

00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:17.800
And my mentor was being
forced at this point,

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.510
now that I ratted
him out-- pro tip,

00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:22.690
never do that-- to HR, he was
being forced to take me out

00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:26.560
for coffee in essentially,
the basement of our building,

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:28.480
and mentor me by force.

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:32.770
And what that entailed was him
banging away on his BlackBerry

00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:36.175
with a full keyboard and
black and white screen,

00:08:36.175 --> 00:08:37.799
probably playing
"Brick Breaker," which

00:08:37.799 --> 00:08:39.549
is still one of the
best games of all time

00:08:39.549 --> 00:08:41.210
on any mobile platform.

00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:46.130
He asked me-- or told me,
rather-- to ask him anything.

00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:48.852
And at this point, I
didn't have a whole lot

00:08:48.852 --> 00:08:50.060
of questions lined up, right?

00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:52.360
I had just figured mentorship
was kind of unidirectional.

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:54.568
I didn't know that I had to
play a part in this other

00:08:54.568 --> 00:08:58.370
than showing up, which shows
my understanding of Wall

00:08:58.370 --> 00:08:59.636
Street at that time.

00:08:59.636 --> 00:09:01.010
But he didn't have
a clue either.

00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:02.426
So the first
question that I asked

00:09:02.426 --> 00:09:04.280
him was something
that I was pretty sure

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:05.400
was going to get me fired.

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:06.590
But I didn't care at this point.

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:08.210
Because again, I thought
it's only a matter of time

00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:10.460
till they find me out
anyway, I might as well get

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:12.290
this one of my chest.

00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:16.130
And I said, how come everyone
is always in the office, always

00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:18.630
billing hours, always billing
in six-minute increments,

00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:20.880
but you're never here.

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:22.100
What are you doing all day?

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:25.110
What do you do at our law firm?

00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:29.240
And he put down his BlackBerry,
and he leaned in, and he said,

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:30.950
who's talking about
what I do all day?

00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:32.324
And at this point,
I'm just like,

00:09:32.324 --> 00:09:34.460
this is how you get
fired at Starbucks.

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:36.690
For sure, in front
of all these people,

00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:39.410
I'm going to get reamed out
by a partner and walk home.

00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:40.980
I'mma leave my phone there.

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:42.480
I'm not going to
go back and get it.

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:42.960
This is it.

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:43.480
This is the end.

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:45.771
It's going to be the most
embarrassing time in my life.

00:09:45.771 --> 00:09:48.464
And of course, I
backtracked like crazy.

00:09:48.464 --> 00:09:50.130
And I said, well,
some people here maybe

00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:52.550
have mentioned that you're just
not around a lot, I don't know.

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:54.300
I'm busy working, so
I didn't even notice.

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:56.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.030
But he goes well look, let
me be honest with you man,

00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:01.970
I bring in all of the deals
for our real estate department.

00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:05.030
I go out and I meet potential
clients, which at that point

00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:06.570
were investment bankers.

00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:09.980
And I do things with them
that create relationships,

00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:11.520
and then they give us business.

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:13.730
That's why we have new
million dollar deals

00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:16.370
every couple of months, or
every quarter here at the firm.

00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:18.020
And I was
super-confused by this,

00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:22.040
because it didn't occur to
me that going out and getting

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:24.710
relationships with people
would somehow bring benefit.

00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:27.170
I thought people found law
firms in the Yellow Pages,

00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:28.940
and hired them and that was it.

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:31.200
Or maybe they were
really good at something,

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:32.600
and so people noticed,
and then they hired them

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:33.558
because of that reason.

00:10:33.558 --> 00:10:37.300
And that turns out to be
only part of the equation.

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:39.990
So what Dave was actually
doing was lead gen,

00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:41.549
business development,
networking,

00:10:41.549 --> 00:10:43.840
relationship development,
whatever you want to call it.

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:45.390
But it was very informal.

00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:47.580
The reason he had a tan
was because he was always

00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:51.930
outside golfing, or running,
or cycling with these bankers.

00:10:51.930 --> 00:10:53.987
He did ju jitsu, which
made him walk with a limp.

00:10:53.987 --> 00:10:56.070
By the way, I don't know
why people still do that.

00:10:56.070 --> 00:10:58.500
Everybody I know who
does ju jitsu is injured.

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:00.870
But he would go on
charity cruises.

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:03.630
He would go out to lunch
with people all the time.

00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:05.130
He would go on charity dinners.

00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:07.470
He was always gone for the
weekend at someone's house

00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:08.610
in the Hamptons.

00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:11.310
And at that time,
being 26, 27 years old,

00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:14.610
that sounded amazing, not just
because it sounded relatively

00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:17.640
easier than checking for
commas in 800-page documents,

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:19.750
which is what I was
doing most of the time,

00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:24.240
but because I actually had
some inkling that I would never

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:26.010
get better at the
lawyer side of things.

00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:28.230
I couldn't make myself smarter.

00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:31.530
And my competitive
advantages had evaporated.

00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:33.900
Because when I was a kid,
I got by a little bit

00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:35.007
on general smarts.

00:11:35.007 --> 00:11:36.590
I'm sure y'all are
familiar with that.

00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:38.548
You go to school, and
you just kind of show up,

00:11:38.548 --> 00:11:39.870
and it's not that hard, right?

00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:42.411
All the way through high school,
but then you get to college,

00:11:42.411 --> 00:11:45.300
and even if everyone is as
smart as you, 90% of the people

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:47.790
there are drinking their
face off every single day.

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:51.230
And you just kind of have
to focus in even a minor way

00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:53.730
to outdo those folks,
and outwork them.

00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:55.380
And that worked in
law school as well.

00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:57.720
But by the time you
get to Wall Street,

00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:00.600
everybody is willing to
work, and everybody is smart.

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:04.260
And I was sure as heck convinced
that they were smarter than me.

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:05.934
And that became a
huge problem, because

00:12:05.934 --> 00:12:08.100
any competitive advantage
that I had been leaning on

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:10.200
for my entire life
had essentially

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:12.934
evaporated the moment I walked
in the door of that firm.

00:12:12.934 --> 00:12:14.850
And I started at the
bottom of the totem pole,

00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:17.740
with no plan on how
to work my way up.

00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:19.824
And so the things that
Dave was talking about,

00:12:19.824 --> 00:12:21.990
this networking, this
relationship development, this

00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:24.390
changed the way that I
looked at work forever.

00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:27.090
Because if he can
learn this skill set,

00:12:27.090 --> 00:12:29.670
or if he can have this,
and I can maybe figure out

00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:31.590
how to do part of that stuff--

00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:34.680
if I can figure out some ways in
which I can increase my skills

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:37.620
in that area, by the time all
these really smart people that

00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:40.770
are working with me on the same
level figure out they even need

00:12:40.770 --> 00:12:43.510
to do this, I'll already
have a four-, five-,

00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:44.460
six-year advantage.

00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:46.514
I'll have a long
leg up in this race.

00:12:46.514 --> 00:12:48.930
This is kind of a tortoise and
the hare-type thing, right?

00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:52.230
So if I start now, maybe if
I stick around long enough

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:53.987
and don't get fired
before then, I'll

00:12:53.987 --> 00:12:56.070
actually have a fighting
chance at making partner.

00:12:56.070 --> 00:12:59.070
That's my plan to get to
the top of the law game.

00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:00.720
You know how that
turned out, so I

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:02.280
don't need to explain that one.

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:04.811
But this was just such a
massive, massive realization

00:13:04.811 --> 00:13:05.310
for me.

00:13:05.310 --> 00:13:07.740
And it really, really
changed the way

00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:09.600
that I started to think
about relationships,

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:11.960
and that I started to
think about my work there.

00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:15.330
It was sort of a secret
third path to get to the top

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:17.190
that nobody else was aware of.

00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:20.140
Now Dave was not the
most skilled lawyer.

00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:21.910
He was not the smartest lawyer.

00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:23.880
He was just the
best-connected lawyer.

00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:25.740
And that sounds a
little bit troubling,

00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:27.323
because obviously,
you want people who

00:13:27.323 --> 00:13:28.770
are competent to be on the top.

00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:30.000
It wasn't that he
was incompetent.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.583
I just want to make
that really clear.

00:13:31.583 --> 00:13:34.140
It wasn't just that
he got by on charm.

00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:36.150
It wasn't just that he
got by on relationships.

00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:38.050
He worked his way
towards the top.

00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:40.710
But his relationships are what
pulled him and propelled him,

00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:43.930
I should say, over the
top early in the game,

00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:45.270
and kept him up there.

00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:48.300
Because as somebody with very
rare people skills and sales

00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:51.030
skills, essentially, for
client development, networking,

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:52.500
whatever you want to call it--

00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:55.590
those skills are so rare
in technical professions

00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:58.890
like being a lawyer, doctor,
dentist, Google perhaps--

00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:00.660
that they're actually
so rare that they

00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:02.430
demand higher compensation.

00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:05.670
And they get you into doors
that would otherwise maybe

00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:08.070
be closed to you, at least
for a few more years.

00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:09.690
And since they
were so rare, they

00:14:09.690 --> 00:14:12.300
made him so valuable
to the firm.

00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:15.750
And this was a guy, bear in
mind, who when he hired me,

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:16.350
I saw him.

00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:18.230
When they forced him to
mentor me, I saw him.

00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:19.646
And the third time
that I saw him,

00:14:19.646 --> 00:14:22.290
he was in the elevator
for an all-hands meeting

00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:24.990
with the managing
partner, essentially

00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:26.250
the CEO of the firm.

00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:29.961
And he joked, is there some kind
of emergency meeting going on?

00:14:29.961 --> 00:14:30.960
What are you doing here?

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:34.620
So it became almost meme,
a joke inside the firm

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:36.840
that Dave was showing
up at any given time,

00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:39.382
because it was so rare it
was an event that everybody

00:14:39.382 --> 00:14:41.590
started talking about, and
actually made jokes about.

00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:46.860
So this is how we calculated
his hourly value, right?

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:48.552
We looked at his time
spent in the firm,

00:14:48.552 --> 00:14:50.760
every six-minute increment
was worth a certain amount

00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:54.880
of money, with him billing
out at about $800 an hour.

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:57.580
If he brings in a
million dollar law deal,

00:14:57.580 --> 00:15:01.480
and he spends 40,
100, 200 hours working

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:05.180
on that particular deal,
every single deal that he gets

00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:05.990
is worth--

00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:08.750
I won't do the math
for you, because that's

00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:10.440
why I became a
lawyer, first of all.

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:11.990
They don't have a lot of math.

00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:13.940
It's a hell of a lot
more than $800 an hour.

00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:15.839
And those deals stack
on to each other.

00:15:15.839 --> 00:15:17.630
Because you get deals
from the same people.

00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:21.350
So his time was worth more than
any other partner in the firm,

00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:24.290
probably worth more than most
of the other partners' time

00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:25.910
combined in the firm.

00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:28.850
So he was able to
write his own ticket.

00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:31.490
And that's why, when I
realized that you needed

00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:33.620
to work outside
the system in order

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:35.900
to succeed inside
the system, I started

00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:37.700
to get my notepad
out and take notes.

00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:40.130
Because I figured if I
can master this skill set,

00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:42.070
then the sky's the limit.

00:15:42.070 --> 00:15:45.130
In the professional spheres,
in any technical profession,

00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:47.920
and in any profession whatsoever
that I've ever encountered,

00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:50.410
the strength of
your relationships

00:15:50.410 --> 00:15:54.190
translates directly to
opportunity, prosperity,

00:15:54.190 --> 00:15:56.405
and flexibility.

00:15:56.405 --> 00:15:58.530
And these are all separate,
but they're all equally

00:15:58.530 --> 00:16:00.497
important in many, many ways.

00:16:00.497 --> 00:16:02.580
And that has to do with
what you end up doing now,

00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:04.590
five years from now,
10 years from now,

00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:06.460
how you're compensated
for doing that,

00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:08.130
and where you're doing that.

00:16:08.130 --> 00:16:11.610
And it's a safe bet that a
handful of people in this room

00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:12.630
like networking.

00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:15.870
I definitely don't even
like the word networking.

00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:19.950
I think it's kind of got a
dirty, kind of crusty feel

00:16:19.950 --> 00:16:20.760
to it these days.

00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:21.990
Because it's smarmy, right?

00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:24.210
You think, throwing business
cards in someone's face,

00:16:24.210 --> 00:16:26.790
and being like, call me when
you need a financial manager.

00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:28.179
And nobody likes those people.

00:16:28.179 --> 00:16:29.720
So it makes you feel
dirty thinking--

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:31.340
and I don't want to do this.

00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:33.540
If I don't have to be
that guy, and I just

00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:36.000
keep my head down and work,
I'll get to the top of this.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.250
And to a certain extent,
that may be true.

00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:41.640
But the rest of us, we hate
networking for that reason.

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:44.460
And that actually harms us,
because that's not the only way

00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:46.770
to get relationships built.
It's not the only way

00:16:46.770 --> 00:16:48.750
to build relationships
with other people,

00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:51.760
and keep them, and maintain
them, and grow them over time.

00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:54.177
And that's why there's
that fundamental difference

00:16:54.177 --> 00:16:56.010
that we have in our
heads of what networking

00:16:56.010 --> 00:16:59.310
is, how it works, and how we
might learn it or not learn it,

00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:04.000
depending on how angsty we get
around that particular term.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.950
At "The Art of Charm,"
we teach people

00:17:05.950 --> 00:17:09.960
how to leverage opportunity,
leverage relationships,

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:12.720
get deals that competitors can
only dream about due to those

00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:15.420
relationships, and turn
something that most of us

00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:17.460
dread secretly or
not so secretly

00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:20.490
into one of our strongest
competitive advantages.

00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:24.135
And no surprise, the old trope
it's all about who you know,

00:17:24.135 --> 00:17:25.770
not what you know--

00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:27.359
that gets thrown around a lot.

00:17:27.359 --> 00:17:28.800
But when people
say that, there's

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:30.890
usually a little bit of
stank on the end, right?

00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:32.405
It's not like, oh, it's
all about who you know.

00:17:32.405 --> 00:17:34.530
It's usually like, oh, it's
all about who you know.

00:17:34.530 --> 00:17:37.740
And we throw that out there when
somebody gets promoted over us,

00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:40.470
or when we lose a deal, or when
we don't get on the project

00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:43.080
that we want to get on,
or when we lose a job,

00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:46.770
or worse, lose a relationship
or a partner because

00:17:46.770 --> 00:17:49.696
of somebody else's
relationship, or their skills

00:17:49.696 --> 00:17:50.820
inside those relationships.

00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:53.160
And even inside
companies like Google,

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:54.799
the most brilliant
idea that you have

00:17:54.799 --> 00:17:57.090
can fail if you don't have
the right people around you,

00:17:57.090 --> 00:17:58.680
if you don't have the
right team around you.

00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:01.013
And I hope none of you have
experienced that first hand.

00:18:01.013 --> 00:18:02.940
Something tells me
that most all of you

00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:05.387
have at this point
in your career

00:18:05.387 --> 00:18:06.720
experienced something like that.

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:09.000
That might even be
why you're here.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.520
And when I was young,
when I was in college,

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:13.530
and to a certain
extent in law school,

00:18:13.530 --> 00:18:16.420
I thought that
networking, relationships,

00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:19.680
networks in general were
things that you were born into.

00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:20.970
Your family had them.

00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:22.470
You went to a fancy
private school

00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:25.380
where you were a blue blazer
with a little insignia on it.

00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:28.980
and you hung out and played
croquet or polo or something

00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:32.430
all day, and everybody went
on to do something amazing.

00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:34.860
And then you could call
those guys and gals together

00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:37.702
at the end of the day, and
figure out world domination

00:18:37.702 --> 00:18:38.910
dot, dot, dot, profit, right?

00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:40.950
That's how I imagined
this would work.

00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:43.726
And sometimes,
people marry into it.

00:18:43.726 --> 00:18:45.975
Which, by the way, if you
do that, highly recommended.

00:18:45.975 --> 00:18:48.060
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:49.590
For the rest of
us, we kind of have

00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:52.630
to figure out how to generate
these relationships on our own.

00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:55.030
And if your parents
didn't do this for you,

00:18:55.030 --> 00:18:57.720
you have to do this if you want
to reap the benefits yourself,

00:18:57.720 --> 00:18:59.094
and if you want
your kids to reap

00:18:59.094 --> 00:19:01.110
the benefits of
relationships and networks

00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:03.070
that you've grown over
the course of your life.

00:19:03.070 --> 00:19:04.944
Because these things
don't happen necessarily

00:19:04.944 --> 00:19:06.190
by themselves.

00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:09.090
The good news is that with
intentional application

00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:11.070
of these topics,
you can actually

00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:14.460
surpass people that were
born into a good network.

00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:16.500
Because they are coasting.

00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:19.020
They're coasting on
their previous momentum.

00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:22.440
And we have our foot on the gas
if we're intentional about it.

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:25.820
Again, the tortoise
and the hare.

00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:28.520
Networking and relationship
development is a way of being.

00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:29.930
It is a set of habits.

00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:33.004
This isn't something that
turns on and off over time.

00:19:33.004 --> 00:19:34.670
It's something that's
always on, but not

00:19:34.670 --> 00:19:37.190
in that always-on used
car salesman kind of way.

00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:38.985
Something that you do
that you systemize--

00:19:38.985 --> 00:19:41.360
and I think I'm in the right
place to talk about systems,

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:42.160
I hope--

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:45.360
something you systemize
and have it work for you.

00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:49.500
I moved to San Francisco from
LA about three or four years

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:50.490
ago now.

00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:53.571
And after a year or two in San
Francisco, a lot of my friends

00:19:53.571 --> 00:19:55.320
who'd grown up there
or who had been there

00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:57.330
for a decade and
change would remark

00:19:57.330 --> 00:19:59.880
things like, how do you
know so many people?

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:02.320
How are you getting
invited to so many things?

00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:04.612
How come we have all these
different relationships?

00:20:04.612 --> 00:20:05.820
I don't really understand it.

00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:07.134
I work from home, actually.

00:20:07.134 --> 00:20:08.550
I don't know if
you all know that.

00:20:08.550 --> 00:20:10.060
I work from my house.

00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:13.710
I see no one except for
my wife all day long.

00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:16.470
I hang out with my cats
more than most people.

00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:19.050
How are these relationships
being developed?

00:20:19.050 --> 00:20:21.150
It doesn't make any
sense from the outside.

00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:23.970
But once you see the matrix,
and see how these things work,

00:20:23.970 --> 00:20:25.230
there's really no going back.

00:20:25.230 --> 00:20:27.790
Because you can
start to systemize.

00:20:27.790 --> 00:20:29.890
Everyone has the
capacity to do this.

00:20:29.890 --> 00:20:31.305
It's another important key.

00:20:31.305 --> 00:20:32.680
A lot of people--
how many people

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:35.620
think they're introverts or kind
of self-proclaimed introverts

00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:37.124
at some level?

00:20:37.124 --> 00:20:37.790
All right, cool.

00:20:37.790 --> 00:20:39.706
I was like uh-oh, no
one's raising their hand?

00:20:39.706 --> 00:20:41.450
But in classic
introvert fashion,

00:20:41.450 --> 00:20:43.910
everyone waited for someone
else to do it first.

00:20:43.910 --> 00:20:46.010
Good, I'm in good company.

00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:48.980
I am also, technically
speaking, an introvert.

00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:50.240
And that's fine.

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:52.626
But what is important
for us to realize

00:20:52.626 --> 00:20:54.500
is that we don't have
a medical excuse to not

00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:55.970
build relationships anymore.

00:20:55.970 --> 00:20:57.678
Introversion is one
of those things where

00:20:57.678 --> 00:21:00.070
it's like well, I would go
and develop relationships,

00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:02.060
I would go to this event,
but I'm an introvert,

00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:04.010
so I'm off the hook.

00:21:04.010 --> 00:21:06.600
And then you go back to
whatever you like to do,

00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:08.920
which is me time, if
you're anything like me.

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:10.140
And I understand that.

00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:13.076
But we can't lean
on that anymore.

00:21:13.076 --> 00:21:14.450
All that introversion
means is we

00:21:14.450 --> 00:21:17.690
prefer to not socialize
with other people,

00:21:17.690 --> 00:21:20.530
or we prefer to recharge
by focusing on ourselves.

00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:23.700
It has nothing to do with our
ability to learn these skills.

00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:26.120
And in fact, new
research now shows

00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:29.150
that introverts in large
part are more introspective,

00:21:29.150 --> 00:21:31.730
and are better at reading
other people's behavior, which

00:21:31.730 --> 00:21:34.850
coincidentally, is great
for building and maintaining

00:21:34.850 --> 00:21:35.700
relationships.

00:21:41.150 --> 00:21:42.980
Your homegrown network
keeps opportunity

00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:44.990
flowing into your life
at an unstoppable pace.

00:21:44.990 --> 00:21:46.620
And that's true whether
you're inside a company,

00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:48.020
whether you're an
entrepreneur, whether you've

00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:49.610
got a good side hustle going.

00:21:49.610 --> 00:21:51.710
And by the way, it's
pure job security

00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:53.240
inside an organization.

00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:56.510
Dave, by the way, left
our sinking law firm,

00:21:56.510 --> 00:21:58.896
because we were heavily
leveraged in 2008

00:21:58.896 --> 00:22:00.020
with the real estate thing.

00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:02.250
I was in the real estate
department, by the way,

00:22:02.250 --> 00:22:03.340
not a good bet.

00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:04.820
He walked out of
that sinking ship

00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:06.890
and walked right into
a partner-level job

00:22:06.890 --> 00:22:08.180
at another firm.

00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:10.490
And I know this because
I saw him in the elevator

00:22:10.490 --> 00:22:12.380
while I was working
at Sirius XM satellite

00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:13.850
radio doing "The Art Of Charm."

00:22:13.850 --> 00:22:16.250
And he said, don't I
know you from somewhere?

00:22:16.250 --> 00:22:18.595
And the answer was,
no, I don't think so.

00:22:18.595 --> 00:22:20.932
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:20.932 --> 00:22:21.890
And he walked right in.

00:22:21.890 --> 00:22:25.010
Everybody else was
punished by the recession.

00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:26.600
My other partners,
my other bosses

00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:27.950
there, they're "retired" now.

00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:29.240
Some of them are in their 40s.

00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:30.948
I don't think they
had planned to do that

00:22:30.948 --> 00:22:33.229
after slaving for a
decade, decade and a half

00:22:33.229 --> 00:22:34.520
to make partner on Wall Street.

00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:36.920
And some of them are
still unraveling that mess

00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:37.880
from a decade ago.

00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:40.790
The recession was a decade
ago, they're still retired.

00:22:40.790 --> 00:22:41.730
This is not good.

00:22:41.730 --> 00:22:44.150
And it's not that they
didn't do the right thing.

00:22:44.150 --> 00:22:45.590
They billed so many hours.

00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:48.440
They worked so hard for their
job, their firm, their clients.

00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:50.570
But they just didn't
have the book of business

00:22:50.570 --> 00:22:53.600
to save their bacon
at the end of the day.

00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:55.820
And the hitch here
really is that even

00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:59.750
if we or you collectively
decide to willfully ignore

00:22:59.750 --> 00:23:01.910
this particular
skill set, you're

00:23:01.910 --> 00:23:05.180
just being willfully ignorant
of the secret game being

00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:06.170
played around you.

00:23:06.170 --> 00:23:08.420
And you're not immune
to the consequences.

00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:11.505
I'm sure plenty of the other
partners in that firm thought

00:23:11.505 --> 00:23:13.880
look, Dave's the guy that goes
out and gets the business.

00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:15.713
There's always going
to be room for me here.

00:23:15.713 --> 00:23:17.270
We always need workhorses.

00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:19.020
And that's just not
necessarily true.

00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:21.200
You have to diversify
your skill set.

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:24.110
And if you're going to skill
stack and have multiple skills

00:23:24.110 --> 00:23:25.670
that you are good
at, one of them

00:23:25.670 --> 00:23:28.290
better be relationship
development.

00:23:28.290 --> 00:23:29.630
So I like to give homework.

00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:31.730
And I know how much everyone
here loves homework.

00:23:31.730 --> 00:23:32.960
But in the next month--

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:35.460
and if you're taking notes,
this is a good time to do that--

00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:38.180
in the next month, pick
one person in your network

00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:40.460
who is a weaker
tie, but with whom

00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:41.830
you'd like a stronger alliance.

00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:43.871
So somebody you thought,
well, I should reach out

00:23:43.871 --> 00:23:45.740
to that person, or
I haven't spoken

00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:47.280
to this person in a long time.

00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:50.926
And just commit to trying
to proactively reignite

00:23:50.926 --> 00:23:52.550
that relationship
through small favors.

00:23:52.550 --> 00:23:53.840
And I'm talking
about finding out

00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:55.220
something they're
interested in and sending

00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:56.720
them an article or
two that you read

00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:58.580
that's recent on the subject.

00:23:58.580 --> 00:24:01.437
Or helping them prepare
for a presentation

00:24:01.437 --> 00:24:03.020
is something that I
always like to do.

00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:05.489
If you've got skills in the
presentation department,

00:24:05.489 --> 00:24:06.530
that's always a good one.

00:24:06.530 --> 00:24:08.960
Because most people feel a
lot of nerves and anxiety

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:09.462
around it.

00:24:09.462 --> 00:24:11.420
If you're in their corner,
or you can help them

00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:13.760
with their slides, anything
really simple, especially

00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:17.690
on a topic that you enjoy is
a really, really good "gift",

00:24:17.690 --> 00:24:18.710
or favor, so to speak.

00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:20.180
So invest some real
time and energy

00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:22.707
into that relationship over
the next several months,

00:24:22.707 --> 00:24:24.290
and you will definitely
see dividends,

00:24:24.290 --> 00:24:25.940
that much I promise you.

00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:30.110
And also, create what I call
an interesting people fund.

00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:33.170
And funnel a certain percentage
of your paycheck-- very small,

00:24:33.170 --> 00:24:33.920
certainly.

00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:37.070
But use this to pay
for lunches, drinks,

00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:40.010
things like that, even a
plane ticket to visit someone,

00:24:40.010 --> 00:24:42.410
or visit an area and have
lunch with somebody or dinner

00:24:42.410 --> 00:24:45.210
with somebody with whom you
want a stronger connection.

00:24:45.210 --> 00:24:48.620
And you guys have this super,
super hook up here at Google,

00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:52.010
because you can invite people
into the campus to have lunch,

00:24:52.010 --> 00:24:52.940
do a tour.

00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:54.230
That is built in for you.

00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:56.150
So if you haven't done
that or if you haven't

00:24:56.150 --> 00:24:58.860
made good use of that
over the past six,

00:24:58.860 --> 00:25:02.000
eight, 18 months or
ever, start doing that.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.500
Maybe just once a month.

00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:06.200
Time flies, but these
things stack up.

00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:08.550
This is compound interest.

00:25:08.550 --> 00:25:11.000
The other reason is that
opportunities are often

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:12.350
over the horizon.

00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:14.120
And what I mean by
that is we often

00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:18.350
don't see the benefit that can
come from helping other people,

00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:19.880
or from re-igniting
relationships

00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:20.714
with other people.

00:25:20.714 --> 00:25:22.380
So right now, a lot
of you are thinking,

00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:24.090
well, OK, I know
a bunch of people,

00:25:24.090 --> 00:25:26.330
but I don't really know
what I want from them,

00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:28.890
or what they would want
from me, so forget it.

00:25:28.890 --> 00:25:31.820
There's nothing I really need,
so I'm not going to do that.

00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:34.190
And that is a huge mistake.

00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:36.290
Because since opportunities
are over the horizon,

00:25:36.290 --> 00:25:39.980
what that means is that you
have no idea whether or not

00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:42.440
you can help them,
or they can help you.

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:44.450
Neither of you know this.

00:25:44.450 --> 00:25:48.290
Case in point, when I first
moved to LA, I had a toothache.

00:25:48.290 --> 00:25:49.880
And if you've ever
had a toothache,

00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:53.570
you probably know the pain
is like it's in your brain.

00:25:53.570 --> 00:25:56.600
This is some of the most
intimate, destructive pain

00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:57.350
that you can feel.

00:25:57.350 --> 00:25:59.990
It's so distracting,
it's all-consuming.

00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:01.550
It seems like it's
inside your head,

00:26:01.550 --> 00:26:02.930
and there's nothing
you can do about it.

00:26:02.930 --> 00:26:04.700
There's not enough
Tylenol in the house.

00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:07.539
There's not enough painkillers
commercially available

00:26:07.539 --> 00:26:09.080
without a prescription
that are going

00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:11.210
to help you without
killing you, if you

00:26:11.210 --> 00:26:12.570
have a strong enough toothache.

00:26:12.570 --> 00:26:14.320
And the problem was,
this is pre-Uber, OK?

00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:15.850
I didn't have a
car at the point.

00:26:15.850 --> 00:26:17.830
I moved straight
from New York to LA.

00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:20.750
I had no dentist, and my
insurance was garbage.

00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:22.400
So of course I'm
calling every dentist

00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:23.750
I can find in the Yellow Pages.

00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:26.270
And they're saying like,
oh just go to the ER.

00:26:26.270 --> 00:26:28.636
Just go to the ER,
they'll take care of you.

00:26:28.636 --> 00:26:30.260
When you go to the
ER with a toothache,

00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:33.080
I have a feeling they tie a
string to it and slam the door,

00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:34.490
and send you on your way home.

00:26:34.490 --> 00:26:36.500
Because as we all
know, health care

00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:39.650
with no insurance or crappy
insurance, especially dental,

00:26:39.650 --> 00:26:40.580
things like that--

00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:41.870
not the business.

00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:44.720
So I posted in
desperation on Facebook,

00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:46.850
does anybody have a
dentist that I can use?

00:26:46.850 --> 00:26:48.350
I need to get this
toothache handled

00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:50.260
so I can continue with my life.

00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:51.770
And a total stranger--

00:26:51.770 --> 00:26:53.840
because I had my privacy
settings completely

00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:55.320
screwed up at this point--

00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:58.940
replies in the thread, and
says, actually, my aunt's

00:26:58.940 --> 00:27:00.020
a dentist in your area.

00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:01.820
I don't really know you, but
it sounds like you're in pain.

00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:03.290
Do you want me to
give her a call?

00:27:03.290 --> 00:27:05.220
Absolutely, I do.

00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:06.309
Absolutely.

00:27:06.309 --> 00:27:07.850
I walked down there
bright and early,

00:27:07.850 --> 00:27:09.920
before she even opens up shop.

00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:11.455
They open, they take care of me.

00:27:11.455 --> 00:27:12.455
I don't get overcharged.

00:27:12.455 --> 00:27:16.790
And I go home a much happier
camper than I was before.

00:27:16.790 --> 00:27:19.010
Now of course, I
go home, and I'm

00:27:19.010 --> 00:27:21.440
infinitely thankful to this
particular stranger, who

00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:23.660
I still to this
day have never met.

00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:25.380
And I write back,
thank you so much.

00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:26.480
You saved my bacon here.

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:28.994
And he says great, I
really am glad to do that.

00:27:28.994 --> 00:27:31.160
By the way, I'm looking for
a job in graphic design.

00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:32.570
Of course, there's a rub.

00:27:32.570 --> 00:27:34.197
Look, I'm not hiring
a graphic designer

00:27:34.197 --> 00:27:36.530
it would be really convenient
for purposes of this story

00:27:36.530 --> 00:27:38.400
if I needed a graphic designer.

00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:40.919
But alas, I'm not going
to lie to you like that.

00:27:40.919 --> 00:27:42.710
So I said I would keep
my ear to the ground

00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:45.211
for him, which translates
roughly to, yeah, whatever,

00:27:45.211 --> 00:27:45.710
man.

00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:46.310
Thanks anyway.

00:27:46.310 --> 00:27:47.880
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:49.950
However, four days
later, five days later,

00:27:49.950 --> 00:27:51.960
another entrepreneur
hit me up and said,

00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:53.670
hey, your website
looks really great.

00:27:53.670 --> 00:27:55.340
I've had a lot of
flaky designers.

00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:56.090
What do you think?

00:27:56.090 --> 00:27:57.200
Do you know anyone?

00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:59.060
Well, we do all of
our design in-house.

00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:00.830
And I said look, I
don't know anyone,

00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:04.190
but this random dude from
Facebook gave me his portfolio.

00:28:04.190 --> 00:28:05.482
Here it is, it's attached.

00:28:05.482 --> 00:28:07.440
All I know is that he
helped me find a dentist,

00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:08.773
and he seems like a nice person.

00:28:08.773 --> 00:28:09.290
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:09.290 --> 00:28:10.826
Not exactly
qualifications you would

00:28:10.826 --> 00:28:12.200
want in somebody
who you're going

00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:14.680
to hire full time for
a position, right?

00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:17.450
But it turns out that
later on, after doing

00:28:17.450 --> 00:28:20.160
a series of discrete jobs
for this entrepreneur,

00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:22.940
this particular individual
ended up getting a full time

00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:25.580
job at this particular company.

00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:29.390
So he went from essentially
working at a local cafe

00:28:29.390 --> 00:28:31.580
and posting about
his job on Facebook

00:28:31.580 --> 00:28:33.890
every five minutes to
getting a full time

00:28:33.890 --> 00:28:36.140
job in his industry of choice.

00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:38.960
The reason that this story
is important and relevant

00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:41.840
is because I had no
idea that I could

00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:44.250
get a dentist from a
person that I never knew.

00:28:44.250 --> 00:28:46.400
That was obviously not
something I foresaw,

00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:49.820
which was the reason I posted
there in the first place.

00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:54.050
However, if he had literally
asked every single person

00:28:54.050 --> 00:28:58.070
that he knew, that he'd ever met
in his whole life, for a job,

00:28:58.070 --> 00:29:00.140
he still would not have
found the job that he

00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:03.280
got by helping me selflessly.

00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:04.990
That is what I mean
by opportunities

00:29:04.990 --> 00:29:06.520
lying over the horizon.

00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:08.290
You don't know who
you can help, and you

00:29:08.290 --> 00:29:09.820
don't know who can help you.

00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:11.140
You have no idea.

00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:13.330
Neither of you do,
and you won't find out

00:29:13.330 --> 00:29:16.090
until you start being
generous with it.

00:29:16.090 --> 00:29:19.540
And that's why we have ABG,
which is always be giving.

00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:21.290
Has anyone seen
"Glengarry Glen Ross?"

00:29:21.290 --> 00:29:23.320
ABC, always be closing?

00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:26.170
So I'll let you
YouTube that one later.

00:29:26.170 --> 00:29:29.050
But essentially, it's about
going after what you want,

00:29:29.050 --> 00:29:32.480
and mercilessly getting it,
and forget everyone else.

00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:34.450
At "Art of Charm,"
we're rocking ABG,

00:29:34.450 --> 00:29:36.520
always be generous,
or always be giving.

00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:38.410
And what this means
is that since you're

00:29:38.410 --> 00:29:41.080
helping other people with
no expectation of anything

00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:43.900
whatsoever in return, you can
find those opportunities that

00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:46.370
are lying over the horizon.

00:29:46.370 --> 00:29:47.360
In many ways, you can.

00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:50.180
It's not always going to
be like this, obviously.

00:29:50.180 --> 00:29:51.950
This is a numbers game.

00:29:51.950 --> 00:29:53.534
And you want to be
the guy or gal that

00:29:53.534 --> 00:29:55.866
looks like they're always
just getting lucky and hitting

00:29:55.866 --> 00:29:57.770
the lottery, because
of the numbers.

00:29:57.770 --> 00:30:00.920
The way you increase your
odds in a numbers game

00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:02.780
is you keep playing the game.

00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:04.175
You keep increasing the numbers.

00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:12.150
So in the next week,
introduce two or more people

00:30:12.150 --> 00:30:14.370
that you know already
do not know each other.

00:30:14.370 --> 00:30:17.460
And the way that you do this is
not by surprise attacking them

00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:19.230
with an email where
they're both cc'd.

00:30:19.230 --> 00:30:21.240
Everyone hates that.

00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:23.550
You hate that, I hate that,
of course they hate that.

00:30:23.550 --> 00:30:25.716
Some people don't know this,
but that's why I always

00:30:25.716 --> 00:30:26.620
throw it out there.

00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:30.000
This is called the
double opt-in intro, OK?

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.700
You email one, and you say,
hey, I know this guy, Bob.

00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:34.830
He works in graphic
design like you,

00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:37.410
and he's got a lot
of capacity for work,

00:30:37.410 --> 00:30:38.460
and he's really talented.

00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:40.251
And then you reach out
to the other person.

00:30:40.251 --> 00:30:42.570
And you say hey, this
guy James is really cool,

00:30:42.570 --> 00:30:44.634
super interesting guy,
got a lot of work.

00:30:44.634 --> 00:30:46.800
Always seems like he's got
deal flow coming through.

00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:47.730
Are you open to meeting him?

00:30:47.730 --> 00:30:49.330
Do you guys know
each other already?

00:30:49.330 --> 00:30:52.020
If they both say yes,
you make the intro.

00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:53.934
If one says no, you don't.

00:30:53.934 --> 00:30:56.100
And I know what you're
thinking, oh, that's awkward.

00:30:56.100 --> 00:30:58.890
What do I tell the other person
who said yes when one says no?

00:30:58.890 --> 00:31:01.380
The answer is you say the
timing isn't right right now.

00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:02.970
True, no lying.

00:31:02.970 --> 00:31:04.170
And you leave it at that.

00:31:04.170 --> 00:31:06.996
And if they ask you again
in a few months, no problem.

00:31:06.996 --> 00:31:09.120
The only time that you
would ever say anything else

00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:11.057
is if there's a serious
issue with that.

00:31:11.057 --> 00:31:12.890
And that's sort of
beyond the scope of this.

00:31:12.890 --> 00:31:14.910
But I would say
that every time you

00:31:14.910 --> 00:31:17.430
double opt-in, you're
most likely going

00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:19.860
to get a yes, especially
from people that don't have

00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:25.020
a ton of introductions coming
from people that they actually

00:31:25.020 --> 00:31:27.540
trust, which by the way, is you.

00:31:27.540 --> 00:31:29.160
People who are doing
the ABG thing who

00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:31.660
are networking well, who are
building a lot of relationships

00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:33.160
will always say yes to an intro.

00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:34.650
It doesn't mean they
have to hire that person.

00:31:34.650 --> 00:31:36.390
It doesn't mean they
have to have lunch.

00:31:36.390 --> 00:31:39.090
It just means they have to say
yes to the email, which usually

00:31:39.090 --> 00:31:42.810
leads to some sort of call or
even just a mutual connection

00:31:42.810 --> 00:31:44.760
so that they're on
each other's radar.

00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:46.620
That alone is enough.

00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:49.350
If you're thinking
about the utility

00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:51.840
that each of these people
have to the other person

00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:55.340
in the interaction,
that alone is enough.

00:31:55.340 --> 00:31:56.900
And if you do this
in the next week,

00:31:56.900 --> 00:31:58.550
and if you do this
once a week, you'll

00:31:58.550 --> 00:32:01.940
have made 52, give or take
some nos, introductions

00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:04.292
every single year,
which is a ton.

00:32:04.292 --> 00:32:05.750
And once you start
ramping this up,

00:32:05.750 --> 00:32:07.970
you realize this is
actually really easy.

00:32:07.970 --> 00:32:10.280
Because if I need
help with something,

00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:11.900
or if you need help
with something,

00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:14.000
the way that this
becomes scalable--

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.950
again, going back
to graphic design,

00:32:15.950 --> 00:32:18.080
let's say that I'm
a graphic designer,

00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:20.240
and you need help
with your website.

00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:22.197
I don't have time to
do your graphic design.

00:32:22.197 --> 00:32:23.780
I don't have time
to do graphic design

00:32:23.780 --> 00:32:25.250
for everyone in this room.

00:32:25.250 --> 00:32:29.150
What I might have time to do is
introduce everyone in this room

00:32:29.150 --> 00:32:31.160
to different capable designers.

00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:35.030
So what I've done is provided
value, followed the ABG

00:32:35.030 --> 00:32:37.700
rule of giving and
helping and being generous

00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:39.860
without actually doing
anything really more

00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:44.360
than connecting one corner of my
web to another part of my web.

00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:46.935
That makes it scalable.

00:32:46.935 --> 00:32:48.560
That's important,
because otherwise you

00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:49.700
will drive yourself
freaking crazy,

00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:52.490
and you'll lose your job, and be
homeless, dot dot dot, the end.

00:32:52.490 --> 00:32:54.100
On the other side
of the equation,

00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:55.850
you've got to think
about a challenge

00:32:55.850 --> 00:32:57.870
that you yourself
are dealing with.

00:32:57.870 --> 00:33:00.360
And you have to ask for help
from your network as well.

00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:04.130
Where people get stuck with the
ABG stuff is they go, oh great,

00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:05.600
I'm going to help everyone.

00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:08.990
And they start sending
58,000 email introductions

00:33:08.990 --> 00:33:12.500
every single week, and they
never ask for what they need.

00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:14.660
And that becomes
almost a pathology.

00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:16.040
If you're there, great.

00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:18.440
It's a good sign that you're
doing some stuff right.

00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:20.600
Start asking for what you need.

00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:23.660
People want to
help you in return.

00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:26.280
It's reciprocity, which is
a human law of psychology,

00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:29.177
and it closes the
loop, I like to say.

00:33:29.177 --> 00:33:31.010
Because I always feel
a little bit of-- wow,

00:33:31.010 --> 00:33:32.926
I really want to do
something for that person.

00:33:32.926 --> 00:33:34.310
They've been so
generous with me.

00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:36.710
If you allow them
to do that, they

00:33:36.710 --> 00:33:39.290
feel good about
helping you as well.

00:33:39.290 --> 00:33:41.780
There's not really a
better win than there

00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:45.830
can be from those two particular
things hitting simultaneously,

00:33:45.830 --> 00:33:47.810
or at some point
in the same three,

00:33:47.810 --> 00:33:50.370
six month, even year time span.

00:33:50.370 --> 00:33:53.627
So we've already talked about
why networking is valuable.

00:33:53.627 --> 00:33:55.710
We've already talked about
how to introduce people

00:33:55.710 --> 00:33:56.335
to one another.

00:33:56.335 --> 00:33:58.460
We've already talked about
how to make it scalable.

00:33:58.460 --> 00:34:00.020
And we've talked
about helping people

00:34:00.020 --> 00:34:02.790
in finding those opportunities
over the horizon.

00:34:02.790 --> 00:34:05.550
The other reason to
do this selfishly,

00:34:05.550 --> 00:34:10.239
or not so selfishly, is that
your network is unique to you.

00:34:10.239 --> 00:34:12.310
You can have a bank account
with no money in it.

00:34:12.310 --> 00:34:13.320
We've all been there.

00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:15.060
And you have value
to offer somebody

00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:17.050
with $10 million dollars,
whatever bajillion

00:34:17.050 --> 00:34:18.300
dollars in their bank account.

00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:21.150
Because you and your
network-- your network

00:34:21.150 --> 00:34:25.469
really is one of the only things
about you that is truly unique.

00:34:25.469 --> 00:34:28.260
I know probably there's going
to be some discussion about how

00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:29.790
we're all special snowflakes.

00:34:29.790 --> 00:34:31.540
Usually that comes
at the end of this.

00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:33.690
But I will tell you
that your network

00:34:33.690 --> 00:34:36.810
is one of the only things
that is unique to you.

00:34:36.810 --> 00:34:40.230
It's one of the only things you
have that nobody else or very

00:34:40.230 --> 00:34:42.150
few other people have,
especially if you've

00:34:42.150 --> 00:34:44.469
been building it up over time.

00:34:44.469 --> 00:34:46.210
So business, of
course, fundamentally

00:34:46.210 --> 00:34:47.670
is people selling
things to people

00:34:47.670 --> 00:34:49.559
that they already ideally know.

00:34:49.559 --> 00:34:51.719
Doing business with
people you know and like

00:34:51.719 --> 00:34:53.639
is one of the most
common ways to do this.

00:34:53.639 --> 00:34:55.650
See the Dave example
in the beginning

00:34:55.650 --> 00:34:57.384
of this particular discussion.

00:34:57.384 --> 00:34:58.800
And everyone's
already heard well,

00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:01.237
you only go as high as
your five closest friends.

00:35:01.237 --> 00:35:02.820
And I'm not saying
ditch your friends.

00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:05.730
That would be like the opposite
of a Tony Robbins seminar,

00:35:05.730 --> 00:35:06.630
probably.

00:35:06.630 --> 00:35:08.970
But we're not going
to do that here.

00:35:08.970 --> 00:35:10.740
Networking and
relationship development

00:35:10.740 --> 00:35:13.874
is one of the single
best ways to make sure

00:35:13.874 --> 00:35:16.290
that you're surrounding yourself
with as many high quality

00:35:16.290 --> 00:35:17.499
people as possible.

00:35:17.499 --> 00:35:18.540
You're doing a great job.

00:35:18.540 --> 00:35:19.998
You're in this room
here at Google.

00:35:19.998 --> 00:35:21.460
Not bad so far.

00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:22.080
Keep it up.

00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:25.380
But many people in this company
and outside this company

00:35:25.380 --> 00:35:26.820
are running into
the problem where

00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:29.153
maybe professionally, they're
surrounded with all stars.

00:35:29.153 --> 00:35:30.990
Maybe personally, not so much.

00:35:30.990 --> 00:35:33.171
Or sometimes the inverse,
depends on what department

00:35:33.171 --> 00:35:34.170
you're in here, I guess.

00:35:34.170 --> 00:35:35.580
That's what I've heard.

00:35:35.580 --> 00:35:39.360
So in the next day, take
a look at your appointment

00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:42.170
book, your calendar, your
Google Calendar, hopefully.

00:35:42.170 --> 00:35:44.520
And over the past
three to six months,

00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:46.530
who have you surrounded
yourself with?

00:35:46.530 --> 00:35:48.571
Who have you been hanging
out with professionally

00:35:48.571 --> 00:35:49.290
and personally?

00:35:49.290 --> 00:35:52.070
With whom have you
spent the most time?

00:35:52.070 --> 00:35:54.540
And are you happy
with the influence

00:35:54.540 --> 00:35:56.317
those people have had on you?

00:35:56.317 --> 00:35:58.650
Because a lot of people think
that they can resist that.

00:35:58.650 --> 00:36:01.197
But you all know you do
fall into the same habits

00:36:01.197 --> 00:36:03.030
and the same traps as
the people that you're

00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:05.610
surrounding yourself
with, voluntarily or not.

00:36:05.610 --> 00:36:07.860
And that's why it's so
toxic to be around people

00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:10.140
who don't have the same
values as you, who don't have

00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:12.330
the same ways of
thinking and mindsets

00:36:12.330 --> 00:36:15.600
of success, happiness, and
things like that than you do.

00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:18.750
Now caveat, this is not
a game you play just

00:36:18.750 --> 00:36:20.550
because you want the spoils.

00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:22.594
It is important to me
personally to help people.

00:36:22.594 --> 00:36:24.135
My whole company,
"The Art of Charm,"

00:36:24.135 --> 00:36:26.190
is founded on that basis.

00:36:26.190 --> 00:36:27.379
And I like helping people.

00:36:27.379 --> 00:36:28.920
I like coming and
speaking to people.

00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:30.482
I love seeing people succeed.

00:36:30.482 --> 00:36:31.440
And I love interacting.

00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:33.730
And if somebody does
not have integrity,

00:36:33.730 --> 00:36:36.030
do not build your
network around them.

00:36:36.030 --> 00:36:38.670
It is so tempting to do this.

00:36:38.670 --> 00:36:41.520
It is so tempting to
go well, this person's

00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:42.886
high up on this totem pole.

00:36:42.886 --> 00:36:44.760
They're really good at
this particular thing.

00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:46.770
They have high
visibility in this area,

00:36:46.770 --> 00:36:48.050
but they're a total scumbag.

00:36:48.050 --> 00:36:49.800
That will always,
always, always come back

00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:51.000
to bite you in the butt.

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.820
You just have to zoom out
far enough on the timeline

00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:57.000
to see how that's happened with
those people in other areas,

00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:58.650
and you will see
yourself becoming

00:36:58.650 --> 00:36:59.850
a victim of that same thing.

00:36:59.850 --> 00:37:02.141
If you don't believe me, look
at what those people have

00:37:02.141 --> 00:37:04.260
been around before, and
zoom out on the timeline

00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:06.930
and you will find an
example of your future

00:37:06.930 --> 00:37:09.240
if you associate
with those people.

00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:13.200
And this entire
process is important,

00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:16.040
because unless you've been
intentional about the process

00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:17.790
of surrounding yourself
with better people

00:37:17.790 --> 00:37:20.790
and leveling up in that area,
your immediate surroundings

00:37:20.790 --> 00:37:23.220
and social circle, there's
a pretty darn good chance

00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:26.850
that it's loaded with people
who are satisfied being

00:37:26.850 --> 00:37:30.030
essentially, mediocre
in whatever area

00:37:30.030 --> 00:37:32.610
that you're trying to level
up in, or one or two areas

00:37:32.610 --> 00:37:35.580
that you're trying to level
up in, health, fitness,

00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:36.570
professional life.

00:37:36.570 --> 00:37:38.070
We've all got those
people that have

00:37:38.070 --> 00:37:40.950
had kind of been around us for
a long time, that maybe are

00:37:40.950 --> 00:37:44.250
no longer adding value
but subtracting it,

00:37:44.250 --> 00:37:46.747
a little bit of an energy
vampire, one might say.

00:37:46.747 --> 00:37:49.080
And if you surround yourself
with high achievers at work

00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:51.120
and at home, you will
absolutely crush.

00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:51.750
You will crush.

00:37:51.750 --> 00:37:54.540
They will bring you up, and
you can bring them up with you

00:37:54.540 --> 00:37:55.390
as well.

00:37:55.390 --> 00:37:57.180
And people, like I
said, want to help you.

00:37:57.180 --> 00:37:58.680
If you're excited
about helping them

00:37:58.680 --> 00:38:00.690
get their goals
accomplished, they

00:38:00.690 --> 00:38:03.150
will get excited about
doing the same for you.

00:38:03.150 --> 00:38:05.310
Always be giving,
and you will get.

00:38:05.310 --> 00:38:06.801
That is simple reciprocity.

00:38:06.801 --> 00:38:08.550
And this is something
that high performers

00:38:08.550 --> 00:38:11.674
rely on all the time,
every single time.

00:38:11.674 --> 00:38:13.590
If you want to look at
charities, for example,

00:38:13.590 --> 00:38:14.940
they're loaded with
the well-to-do.

00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:16.189
And there's a reason for that.

00:38:16.189 --> 00:38:17.700
It's not just
about being social.

00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:20.057
It's a way for people
in distinct silos

00:38:20.057 --> 00:38:22.140
to be around other people
that they would normally

00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:25.370
never get to interact with
while working on a common goal.

00:38:25.370 --> 00:38:27.709
It is a very sort
of tricky thing

00:38:27.709 --> 00:38:30.000
to wrap your mind around
sometimes, especially when you

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:31.209
just see it from the outside.

00:38:31.209 --> 00:38:32.833
But when you get in
the middle of that,

00:38:32.833 --> 00:38:35.490
you realize that most of those
people are thinking like that.

00:38:35.490 --> 00:38:39.660
It's a strategy,
it's not coincidence.

00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:42.540
The number one rule of
relationship building

00:38:42.540 --> 00:38:45.930
is to build it
before you need it.

00:38:45.930 --> 00:38:49.624
Dig the well before
you are thirsty.

00:38:49.624 --> 00:38:51.040
Networking once
you need something

00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:54.220
like a job or a
relationship, for example,

00:38:54.220 --> 00:38:55.740
that is not effective.

00:38:55.740 --> 00:38:57.550
And a lot of people
think they can do that.

00:38:57.550 --> 00:38:58.990
How many people have
been like, oh you know,

00:38:58.990 --> 00:39:00.940
I'm totally going to start this
relationship development thing,

00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:02.860
but I've got to get
this project done.

00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:05.562
I've got to move up one
run on the ladder at work.

00:39:05.562 --> 00:39:07.020
I've got to get
this website going.

00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:10.750
I really need to get
my move handled first,

00:39:10.750 --> 00:39:13.360
and get settled in my new place.

00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:15.160
Some sort of excuse,
false deadline

00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:17.290
is often what keeps us
from moving forward.

00:39:17.290 --> 00:39:18.880
We have to ditch those.

00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:21.130
Because think about this,
who would you rather help,

00:39:21.130 --> 00:39:23.088
somebody who's helped
you out with a few things

00:39:23.088 --> 00:39:25.345
over the last few months
or the last few years,

00:39:25.345 --> 00:39:27.970
or someone that calls you out of
the blue and is like, hey man,

00:39:27.970 --> 00:39:28.210
yeah.

00:39:28.210 --> 00:39:28.720
What's up, man?

00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:29.710
I want to take you
out for a beer,

00:39:29.710 --> 00:39:30.700
it's been such a long time.

00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:32.158
And then you get
there, and they're

00:39:32.158 --> 00:39:33.670
like Herbalife or
whatever, right?

00:39:33.670 --> 00:39:35.900
You're just like, oh
god, I knew it, right?

00:39:35.900 --> 00:39:37.640
I knew this was going to happen.

00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:40.270
Waiting to form relationships
only once you need them

00:39:40.270 --> 00:39:42.759
is like carrying a spare
tire in the trunk of your car

00:39:42.759 --> 00:39:44.800
after you're stranded on
the side of the highway.

00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:45.790
That's not good.

00:39:45.790 --> 00:39:47.380
So here's a thought
exercise for you.

00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:54.009
Imagine that you got laid
off from your job today.

00:39:54.009 --> 00:39:55.300
Not going to happen, hopefully.

00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:57.299
You have my personal
guarantee, how's that?

00:39:57.299 --> 00:39:58.840
You got laid off
from your job today.

00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:02.260
Who are the 10 people that
you would contact for help

00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:03.225
if that happened?

00:40:03.225 --> 00:40:05.890
You get laid off today,
who are you contacting,

00:40:05.890 --> 00:40:08.530
10 people for help,
and figure out

00:40:08.530 --> 00:40:10.000
what you're going to do next.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:14.340
Make that list of 10 people,
then reach out to them now when

00:40:14.340 --> 00:40:15.340
you don't need anything.

00:40:18.122 --> 00:40:20.330
If you've been laid off,
you know that's a good idea.

00:40:23.550 --> 00:40:26.070
So networking, creating
those relationships only

00:40:26.070 --> 00:40:27.570
when you need it
it's not effective.

00:40:27.570 --> 00:40:28.920
It is too late.

00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:31.890
80% of new jobs are found
through networks, not

00:40:31.890 --> 00:40:32.970
through monster.com.

00:40:32.970 --> 00:40:35.070
You don't want to see
the stats on that.

00:40:35.070 --> 00:40:36.975
Nobody looks at
their inbox, even

00:40:36.975 --> 00:40:39.600
if they're using the new
Gmail spam filters and stuff

00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:40.879
like that, doesn't matter.

00:40:40.879 --> 00:40:41.920
It's all via the network.

00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:44.010
And everyone who works
at my company, everyone

00:40:44.010 --> 00:40:46.650
who works at "The Art of
Charm" has gotten their job

00:40:46.650 --> 00:40:48.206
by networking and relationships.

00:40:48.206 --> 00:40:50.580
That obviously makes sense,
because that's what we teach.

00:40:50.580 --> 00:40:53.650
You will find that
works in 80% of cases.

00:40:53.650 --> 00:40:56.820
And when you get to higher
performing jobs, better jobs

00:40:56.820 --> 00:40:58.970
that are higher
paid compensation,

00:40:58.970 --> 00:41:01.660
or involve different or
better projects, that number,

00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:04.110
that percentage goes
much, much higher.

00:41:04.110 --> 00:41:06.030
Because the job,
the stakes are too

00:41:06.030 --> 00:41:09.120
high to rely on a simple
recruiting process that

00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:11.160
doesn't have a little
finger on the scale

00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:12.907
from relationships
and previous vetting

00:41:12.907 --> 00:41:14.990
from people who've been
there or know that person.

00:41:17.690 --> 00:41:18.952
So this is about action.

00:41:18.952 --> 00:41:20.660
It's not about collecting
business cards.

00:41:20.660 --> 00:41:23.410
It's not about your Rolodex,
if those things still exist,

00:41:23.410 --> 00:41:25.180
which I doubt.

00:41:25.180 --> 00:41:28.460
The best way to do this is to
create a platform to do this.

00:41:28.460 --> 00:41:30.250
A lot of people
have industry blogs.

00:41:30.250 --> 00:41:32.440
My platform is my podcast,
"The Art of Charm."

00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:34.240
It puts me in a visible place.

00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:36.040
It puts me in a
position to interact

00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:38.980
with interesting people
that have other connections,

00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:41.227
and connect with connectors.

00:41:41.227 --> 00:41:43.810
So if you don't have a podcast,
you don't have a big old blog,

00:41:43.810 --> 00:41:45.684
or you can talk about
what you're working on,

00:41:45.684 --> 00:41:48.130
which is a lot of you, I
know that, the greatest

00:41:48.130 --> 00:41:50.170
way I've found to do
this is to organize

00:41:50.170 --> 00:41:53.440
little low key, low pressure
dinner parties with people

00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:56.230
in similar or
different industries

00:41:56.230 --> 00:41:58.510
that are relevant enough
where one person each time

00:41:58.510 --> 00:42:00.692
can teach the group something.

00:42:00.692 --> 00:42:02.650
So you might have a dinner
party at your place,

00:42:02.650 --> 00:42:04.240
and you might teach
a little bit of SEO.

00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:05.560
I don't know if you guys
are allowed to do that.

00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:07.210
That's my go-to
example, but whatever.

00:42:07.210 --> 00:42:08.950
Put something else
in there instead.

00:42:08.950 --> 00:42:10.480
Somebody might
teach outsourcing.

00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:11.938
That might be a
better one for you.

00:42:11.938 --> 00:42:13.750
Social media is a good one.

00:42:13.750 --> 00:42:15.550
These are things that
are pretty default.

00:42:15.550 --> 00:42:17.110
These work really well
with entrepreneurs.

00:42:17.110 --> 00:42:19.000
They work really great
for people in general

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:20.770
who are interested in business.

00:42:20.770 --> 00:42:23.980
Y'all are pretty technical,
some of you I would imagine.

00:42:23.980 --> 00:42:26.260
And you can teach
certain discrete skills

00:42:26.260 --> 00:42:29.260
to the group in a way
that doesn't set you up

00:42:29.260 --> 00:42:31.660
for any sort of trouble
at work, but also

00:42:31.660 --> 00:42:32.965
sets you up on a platform.

00:42:32.965 --> 00:42:35.157
And if you're hosting
these dinner parties,

00:42:35.157 --> 00:42:36.490
you can invite different people.

00:42:36.490 --> 00:42:38.320
You can insist they
bring one other person

00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:39.630
that you don't yet know.

00:42:40.210 --> 00:42:42.280
And someone who's been
there the previous week

00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:45.160
comes prepared that next
week to teach a subject.

00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:46.989
Doesn't have to be
an hour-long lecture.

00:42:46.989 --> 00:42:48.280
Can be something really simple.

00:42:48.280 --> 00:42:49.720
Doesn't have to be whiteboarded.

00:42:49.720 --> 00:42:51.636
Just has to be interesting
and valuable enough

00:42:51.636 --> 00:42:53.830
to keep people showing
up and keep the event fun

00:42:53.830 --> 00:42:55.990
enough that people continue
to come and continue

00:42:55.990 --> 00:42:57.970
to bring others into that.

00:42:57.970 --> 00:43:00.460
This sets you up
as the network hub.

00:43:00.460 --> 00:43:02.650
It sets you up as the connector.

00:43:02.650 --> 00:43:04.880
And if you can connect
with other connectors,

00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:06.100
now you're cooking with gas.

00:43:06.100 --> 00:43:08.740
Of course, my platform,
like I said, is a podcast.

00:43:08.740 --> 00:43:10.990
And look, networking
is a muscle.

00:43:10.990 --> 00:43:12.490
It grows with use.

00:43:12.490 --> 00:43:15.310
It is not a pie that gets
eaten up piece by piece.

00:43:15.310 --> 00:43:17.380
If you call in
help from somebody,

00:43:17.380 --> 00:43:19.870
that is not going to
use up that contact.

00:43:19.870 --> 00:43:21.292
A lot of people
operate like that.

00:43:21.292 --> 00:43:22.750
They're afraid to
call on somebody.

00:43:22.750 --> 00:43:25.510
Well, I don't want to email them
about this because, you know,

00:43:25.510 --> 00:43:27.730
then I've used my one time
that I can get in touch.

00:43:27.730 --> 00:43:29.510
No, it's quite the opposite.

00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:31.117
It's a muscle that
grows with use.

00:43:31.117 --> 00:43:33.700
The more you network, the more
you introduce people to others,

00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:37.210
the more you create that
value, the more you ABG,

00:43:37.210 --> 00:43:38.930
the more that muscle will grow.

00:43:38.930 --> 00:43:40.870
And if you hoard
your network, it

00:43:40.870 --> 00:43:43.910
will atrophy the same
as a muscle as well.

00:43:43.910 --> 00:43:49.570
So it all comes back to ABG and
doing so in a systemized way.

00:43:49.570 --> 00:43:51.627
And one final sort
of example here

00:43:51.627 --> 00:43:53.710
of asking for help, because
I know a lot of people

00:43:53.710 --> 00:43:54.670
are shy with that.

00:43:54.670 --> 00:43:57.490
I didn't get into law school
the first time I applied.

00:43:57.490 --> 00:43:58.560
I didn't get in at all.

00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:00.070
In fact, I got rejected.

00:44:00.070 --> 00:44:02.860
And I remember sitting
in a house up north

00:44:02.860 --> 00:44:06.711
and just thinking, wow, that
was my hail Mary at figuring out

00:44:06.711 --> 00:44:08.710
what I was going to do
for the next three years.

00:44:08.710 --> 00:44:10.780
I can't even get a
job at freaking Best

00:44:10.780 --> 00:44:13.850
Buy with a college degree from
the University of Michigan.

00:44:13.850 --> 00:44:15.009
I'm so screwed.

00:44:15.009 --> 00:44:17.050
I don't even know what
I'm going to do right now.

00:44:17.050 --> 00:44:19.720
I should just walk
into the Great Lakes

00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:22.030
that I'm looking at right
now, and just keep walking,

00:44:22.030 --> 00:44:23.300
and figure out it from there.

00:44:23.300 --> 00:44:24.800
I mean, there was
nothing happening.

00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:27.704
So in desperation, I reached
out to a lot of my friends

00:44:27.704 --> 00:44:28.870
who'd already been admitted.

00:44:28.870 --> 00:44:31.090
They were a year ahead of me,
a couple of months ahead of me,

00:44:31.090 --> 00:44:33.730
a semester ahead of me, or just
getting in at that same level.

00:44:33.730 --> 00:44:35.560
And I said, what would you do?

00:44:35.560 --> 00:44:37.660
And they said, all right.

00:44:37.660 --> 00:44:42.190
Write a letter that explains
why you should be let in,

00:44:42.190 --> 00:44:45.094
and send me a copy,
and I will look at it.

00:44:45.094 --> 00:44:47.510
Almost everybody said something
similar along those lines,

00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:49.580
because I had them
all in one thread.

00:44:49.580 --> 00:44:50.800
And so I wrote this letter.

00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:53.189
I figured, this is just
such a waste of time.

00:44:53.189 --> 00:44:54.730
I don't even know
why I'm doing this.

00:44:54.730 --> 00:44:55.990
But they kind of
forced me to do it.

00:44:55.990 --> 00:44:57.100
I was just going to say, great.

00:44:57.100 --> 00:44:58.808
Thanks for the
suggestion, and not do it.

00:44:58.808 --> 00:45:00.970
My friend Greg, thank
god he made me do this.

00:45:00.970 --> 00:45:01.950
So I sent it back.

00:45:01.950 --> 00:45:03.970
I got a bunch of
corrections based on the way

00:45:03.970 --> 00:45:07.210
that they've learned their
legal prose and argumentation.

00:45:07.210 --> 00:45:08.860
Put it in a really
interesting format

00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:10.020
that I'd never seen before.

00:45:10.020 --> 00:45:12.200
It looked like a legal
brief of some kind.

00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:14.350
And I sent it to the
admissions office.

00:45:14.350 --> 00:45:16.870
And a couple of
those guys and gals

00:45:16.870 --> 00:45:18.490
sent letters to the
admissions office

00:45:18.490 --> 00:45:20.740
telling them why they think it
was a mistake that I wasn't let

00:45:20.740 --> 00:45:23.320
into the school at some point,
and that I was definitely

00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:25.690
Michigan material, because
I went for undergrad and law

00:45:25.690 --> 00:45:27.680
school, just to avoid confusion.

00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:31.450
And so after a few
weeks, I got a call

00:45:31.450 --> 00:45:32.950
from the admissions office.

00:45:32.950 --> 00:45:35.684
And they said, look, never
seen anybody do this.

00:45:35.684 --> 00:45:37.100
This is a really
interesting idea.

00:45:37.100 --> 00:45:39.820
And the fact that you put this
into such a coherent argument

00:45:39.820 --> 00:45:41.350
in a letter, you
sent it back, you

00:45:41.350 --> 00:45:43.360
weren't expecting
anything-- and my trade-off

00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:45.318
was, you don't have to
let me in for this year.

00:45:45.318 --> 00:45:47.800
Let me in for next year, and
I will kill the rest of it.

00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:49.540
I'll figure out what
to do with my time.

00:45:49.540 --> 00:45:51.670
And we all know how you
can kill a year in college

00:45:51.670 --> 00:45:52.940
pretty easily.

00:45:52.940 --> 00:45:54.065
And so they said, fine.

00:45:54.065 --> 00:45:55.690
We'll convene the
admissions committee.

00:45:55.690 --> 00:45:57.731
We have another meeting,
and I'll run it by them.

00:45:57.731 --> 00:45:59.470
And they called
a few days later,

00:45:59.470 --> 00:46:02.560
and they let me in not for that
year, but for the next year,

00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:03.640
just as I'd suggested.

00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:05.180
So think about this.

00:46:05.180 --> 00:46:07.300
I got into one of
the best law schools

00:46:07.300 --> 00:46:11.200
in America, where I'd
previously been rejected,

00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:13.960
because I asked for help.

00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:15.580
Those people were glad to do it.

00:46:15.580 --> 00:46:17.209
We're still friends to this day.

00:46:17.209 --> 00:46:19.750
And I'm still getting a reminder
every single month about how

00:46:19.750 --> 00:46:23.350
valuable that law degree was.

00:46:23.350 --> 00:46:25.500
Now I think we've got a
little bit of time left.

00:46:25.500 --> 00:46:26.910
Are you keeping time?

00:46:26.910 --> 00:46:28.380
We're good?

00:46:28.380 --> 00:46:29.860
Great, so let's go to Serbia.

00:46:29.860 --> 00:46:32.110
So here's a here's a more
fun example than law school,

00:46:32.110 --> 00:46:35.680
in my humble opinion.

00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:41.660
So in 2005, I was 25 years
old, and I worked for--

00:46:41.660 --> 00:46:43.900
well I was actually
coincidentally killing a year

00:46:43.900 --> 00:46:45.220
before law school.

00:46:45.220 --> 00:46:47.740
And I had a fellowship from
the Department of Defense

00:46:47.740 --> 00:46:49.330
to go in to work
in Serbia, which

00:46:49.330 --> 00:46:51.960
is in the former
Yugoslavia, not Siberia.

00:46:51.960 --> 00:46:55.130
Serbia, different place,
former Yugoslavia,

00:46:55.130 --> 00:46:57.370
southern Balkans Europe area.

00:46:57.370 --> 00:46:58.870
And when you go to
Serbia, you have

00:46:58.870 --> 00:47:00.820
to register with the
government and tell them

00:47:00.820 --> 00:47:02.410
where you're living,
and the police

00:47:02.410 --> 00:47:04.480
have to stamp this little
piece of paper that

00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:06.450
says you're a foreigner
living in the country.

00:47:06.450 --> 00:47:08.200
I know that's really
foreign to Americans.

00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:09.600
But if you've ever been
to the Eastern Bloc,

00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:11.110
this is super commonplace.

00:47:11.110 --> 00:47:13.760
They love to keep tabs on
everybody and everything.

00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:15.925
And you have to live
with a Serbian person.

00:47:15.925 --> 00:47:17.050
You can't live on your own.

00:47:17.050 --> 00:47:19.996
You can't just stay in
some house that you rent.

00:47:19.996 --> 00:47:22.120
It's not an Airbnb, which
didn't exist at the time.

00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:23.830
You're not allowed to
do anything like that.

00:47:23.830 --> 00:47:25.960
You have to have somebody
who's vouching for you.

00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:28.390
And this got really annoying,
because every time I

00:47:28.390 --> 00:47:31.270
left the country or left even
the county and city area where

00:47:31.270 --> 00:47:33.550
I was, I had to re-register.

00:47:33.550 --> 00:47:36.070
So I had to every single
time I would take a drive

00:47:36.070 --> 00:47:37.750
to a restaurant
outside of Belgrade,

00:47:37.750 --> 00:47:39.790
I had to re-register
with the police.

00:47:39.790 --> 00:47:42.540
And that was never a smooth
process, often involved

00:47:42.540 --> 00:47:44.230
an annoying fee.

00:47:44.230 --> 00:47:48.040
And also resulted in me
having a couple of incidences

00:47:48.040 --> 00:47:50.050
that really got old fast.

00:47:50.050 --> 00:47:52.660
For example, I was coming
back from a visit to Germany.

00:47:52.660 --> 00:47:55.390
I came back at about 11
o'clock at night or 10:00,

00:47:55.390 --> 00:47:57.970
ended up in the police station
where the registration is done

00:47:57.970 --> 00:47:59.440
around 10:00, 11:00 at night.

00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:01.360
And the police officer
who is on duty there

00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:04.600
decided that since I was in the
police station at that hour,

00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:05.990
I must have done
something wrong,

00:48:05.990 --> 00:48:07.690
even though I walked in alone.

00:48:07.690 --> 00:48:11.410
And he put me in a prison
cell with three chain-smoking

00:48:11.410 --> 00:48:14.230
prostitutes who spoke in a
loud-ass foreign language

00:48:14.230 --> 00:48:17.760
for the entire night, smoking
unfiltered cigarettes.

00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:20.170
And it was one of the worst
nights of my entire life.

00:48:20.170 --> 00:48:22.510
And I decided, this is
not happening again.

00:48:22.510 --> 00:48:24.790
I am not doing this
registration thing.

00:48:24.790 --> 00:48:27.090
This is an offense to
freedom everywhere.

00:48:27.090 --> 00:48:28.400
I'm not doing this.

00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:30.949
And so I decided, I'm just
going to say to hell with this.

00:48:30.949 --> 00:48:33.490
They're so disorganized, they're
never even going to find me.

00:48:33.490 --> 00:48:36.930
Well, I'll let you
know how that goes.

00:48:36.930 --> 00:48:39.770
So I conceived a brilliant
plan to have my friends

00:48:39.770 --> 00:48:42.740
say that I was staying with
them, even though I wasn't,

00:48:42.740 --> 00:48:44.270
and then what are
the police going

00:48:44.270 --> 00:48:47.225
to do, come and inspect
and see where I live?

00:48:47.225 --> 00:48:49.100
So the police came and
inspected to see where

00:48:49.100 --> 00:48:51.826
I live, and I wasn't there.

00:48:51.826 --> 00:48:53.450
And they said, oh
yeah, he's traveling.

00:48:53.450 --> 00:48:54.647
So they said, OK, fine.

00:48:54.647 --> 00:48:56.480
And so they came back
about two weeks later,

00:48:56.480 --> 00:48:58.490
and they said,
where's his stuff?

00:48:58.490 --> 00:48:59.690
Oh, he's not here.

00:48:59.690 --> 00:49:02.148
And so the police gave my friend
[? Yellen ?] an ultimatum,

00:49:02.148 --> 00:49:05.565
and they said, if he's not here
the next time that we come,

00:49:05.565 --> 00:49:07.940
we're going to look for him,
but you're going to help us,

00:49:07.940 --> 00:49:10.065
and you're going to stay
with us until we find him.

00:49:10.065 --> 00:49:12.860
And that was pretty loud and
clear for, guess what, Jordan?

00:49:12.860 --> 00:49:15.320
You're moving
tonight at 1:30 AM.

00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:16.404
Luckily, moving was easy.

00:49:16.404 --> 00:49:17.820
Didn't have anything
at her house.

00:49:17.820 --> 00:49:20.450
But what it did mean is that it
had to go to the police station

00:49:20.450 --> 00:49:21.890
and register again.

00:49:21.890 --> 00:49:22.820
And I decided, fine.

00:49:22.820 --> 00:49:23.730
I'm going to do that.

00:49:23.730 --> 00:49:26.079
So I decided to
pull the same thing

00:49:26.079 --> 00:49:28.370
because it worked for a few
months with another friend.

00:49:28.370 --> 00:49:32.480
And that guy went and moved to
his weekend house, a cottage

00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:34.040
for months, so he wasn't home.

00:49:34.040 --> 00:49:36.630
So what the police found when
they went to inspect again,

00:49:36.630 --> 00:49:39.890
was not only was I not there,
nobody was there at all

00:49:39.890 --> 00:49:41.090
for a long, long time.

00:49:41.090 --> 00:49:43.050
And that raised a red flag.

00:49:43.050 --> 00:49:46.370
And when you live in the Eastern
Bloc, red flags mean trouble.

00:49:46.370 --> 00:49:48.530
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:48.530 --> 00:49:52.850
So this started to get
really scary for them, right?

00:49:52.850 --> 00:49:55.760
My friend was getting calls
because I was registered there.

00:49:55.760 --> 00:49:58.460
And I was hanging out and
thinking, look, this is fine.

00:49:58.460 --> 00:50:00.040
I'll just go and fix this.

00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:01.936
But Serbia's not exactly
the kind of place

00:50:01.936 --> 00:50:03.560
where you walk into
the police station,

00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:05.210
as I had learned
before, and say, hey, I

00:50:05.210 --> 00:50:06.380
heard you guys have
been looking for me.

00:50:06.380 --> 00:50:07.700
What can I do for you?

00:50:07.700 --> 00:50:10.760
So I decided I'm going to
handle this, just not right now.

00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:12.800
So I had an appointment
at the American Embassy

00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:14.110
to take care of everything.

00:50:14.110 --> 00:50:16.295
Before that, I had tickets
to a music festival,

00:50:16.295 --> 00:50:18.817
and this was going
to be awesome.

00:50:18.817 --> 00:50:20.150
So I went to the music festival.

00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:22.681
It was three days long, and it
was on this Turkish fortress

00:50:22.681 --> 00:50:23.180
island.

00:50:23.180 --> 00:50:24.513
It looks like "Game of Thrones."

00:50:24.513 --> 00:50:27.170
In fact, I think they may have
filmed some "Game of Thrones"

00:50:27.170 --> 00:50:27.730
stuff there.

00:50:27.730 --> 00:50:31.010
It's an island that is an
Ottoman Empire fortress,

00:50:31.010 --> 00:50:33.050
and there's 20
stages set up here

00:50:33.050 --> 00:50:35.840
when they have this
festival, no cars allowed.

00:50:35.840 --> 00:50:36.650
Huge.

00:50:36.650 --> 00:50:39.140
I mean, it is just
mind-blowingly

00:50:39.140 --> 00:50:40.700
enormous and cool.

00:50:40.700 --> 00:50:42.680
And everything
was going so well.

00:50:42.680 --> 00:50:45.020
I'd been up for probably
like a day and a half

00:50:45.020 --> 00:50:47.690
partying, hanging out
with my friends, drinking.

00:50:47.690 --> 00:50:49.554
We did some weird
cameo on MTV Europe

00:50:49.554 --> 00:50:51.720
where I didn't understand
what they're saying to me,

00:50:51.720 --> 00:50:53.030
but it didn't matter.

00:50:53.030 --> 00:50:55.340
And I just couldn't have
been having more fun.

00:50:55.340 --> 00:50:58.700
But there was a black Jeep
that started rolling around

00:50:58.700 --> 00:51:01.520
the island towards when
everybody was getting done.

00:51:01.520 --> 00:51:03.860
And they were kind of
inspecting people, and looking

00:51:03.860 --> 00:51:07.910
through the crowd, and shining
a light on people as dawn broke.

00:51:07.910 --> 00:51:09.770
And everyone has to
leave on this bridge

00:51:09.770 --> 00:51:10.910
and walk on this bridge.

00:51:10.910 --> 00:51:14.390
And so as we started
to do that, they

00:51:14.390 --> 00:51:17.540
stopped a friend of
mine and me, and they

00:51:17.540 --> 00:51:19.160
said, where are your passports?

00:51:19.160 --> 00:51:22.140
Because in Serbia, you have to
carry your passport with you

00:51:22.140 --> 00:51:24.450
everywhere you go if
you're a foreigner.

00:51:24.450 --> 00:51:26.300
You have to have
your international ID

00:51:26.300 --> 00:51:27.517
with you no matter what.

00:51:27.517 --> 00:51:30.100
I carried a copy, because who's
going to carry their passport?

00:51:30.100 --> 00:51:32.042
You're going to lose
it, whole big thing.

00:51:32.042 --> 00:51:33.500
So I carried a copy
of my passport.

00:51:33.500 --> 00:51:35.190
That was not satisfactory.

00:51:35.190 --> 00:51:36.110
So what did they do?

00:51:36.110 --> 00:51:39.230
They called to make sure
that I was who I said I was.

00:51:39.230 --> 00:51:41.000
But guess what happened
when they called?

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:42.680
He's not registered.

00:51:42.680 --> 00:51:44.360
We've been looking for him.

00:51:44.360 --> 00:51:45.842
Whoops.

00:51:45.842 --> 00:51:48.050
Also to add a little bit of
something else, something

00:51:48.050 --> 00:51:51.470
special to the pot, my friend
had a bit of a checkered past,

00:51:51.470 --> 00:51:53.930
where he was related
to an organized crime

00:51:53.930 --> 00:51:56.927
figure from his family,
and they had moved,

00:51:56.927 --> 00:51:58.760
and then he came back
to hang out in Serbia.

00:51:58.760 --> 00:52:01.670
So these guys figure, we've
hit the freaking jackpot.

00:52:01.670 --> 00:52:03.770
We've got an American
spy who's basically

00:52:03.770 --> 00:52:07.470
a fugitive and
some mafioso's kid.

00:52:07.470 --> 00:52:11.970
So at this point, I think great,
we're going to jail, hopefully

00:52:11.970 --> 00:52:13.117
not worse.

00:52:13.117 --> 00:52:14.700
And to make things
a little bit worse,

00:52:14.700 --> 00:52:16.260
these guys were not sober.

00:52:16.260 --> 00:52:17.890
These guys were on drugs.

00:52:17.890 --> 00:52:20.970
And to put this into a
little bit of perspective,

00:52:20.970 --> 00:52:23.650
Serbian state security
officers at this point in time,

00:52:23.650 --> 00:52:25.800
they're not like
the American FBI.

00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:28.620
These are guys who fought in
militias in Bosnia or whatever.

00:52:28.620 --> 00:52:31.350
Their village got eradicated
by Croats, or Bosniaks,

00:52:31.350 --> 00:52:32.160
or whatever.

00:52:32.160 --> 00:52:33.330
Now they live in Serbia.

00:52:33.330 --> 00:52:35.820
And in order to not be
prosecuted for war crimes

00:52:35.820 --> 00:52:38.520
or things they did back
there that were illegal,

00:52:38.520 --> 00:52:40.950
they became agents
of the state that are

00:52:40.950 --> 00:52:42.760
above regular prosecution laws.

00:52:42.760 --> 00:52:45.900
So they basically just run
around, do whatever they want,

00:52:45.900 --> 00:52:48.300
except for obviously
not getting any therapy

00:52:48.300 --> 00:52:50.820
for their PTSD and
all of the things

00:52:50.820 --> 00:52:53.250
that are causing them
to be hammered at 7:30,

00:52:53.250 --> 00:52:55.530
8:00 AM in the morning.

00:52:55.530 --> 00:52:56.940
So they're slurring.

00:52:56.940 --> 00:52:57.970
They're not rational.

00:52:57.970 --> 00:52:59.010
They're aggressive.

00:52:59.010 --> 00:53:00.090
And I'm thinking, great.

00:53:00.090 --> 00:53:04.020
I'm going to get pistol whipped
in front of like 20,000 people,

00:53:04.020 --> 00:53:05.850
and there's nothing
I can do about it.

00:53:05.850 --> 00:53:09.030
And my friend is all
doing the classic,

00:53:09.030 --> 00:53:10.810
let me talk my way out
of this type thing.

00:53:10.810 --> 00:53:12.180
And that's not going too well.

00:53:12.180 --> 00:53:13.950
And I'm replying, look, man.

00:53:13.950 --> 00:53:14.789
I'm not a fugitive.

00:53:14.789 --> 00:53:15.580
I'm not a criminal.

00:53:15.580 --> 00:53:17.310
I just teach refugees English.

00:53:17.310 --> 00:53:19.866
And look, here's my passport.

00:53:19.866 --> 00:53:20.990
We can go get the real one.

00:53:20.990 --> 00:53:21.989
We'll go to the embassy.

00:53:21.989 --> 00:53:23.860
We'll make not a
big deal out of it.

00:53:23.860 --> 00:53:26.730
And they thought
that was an OK idea.

00:53:26.730 --> 00:53:28.260
But first, they had other ideas.

00:53:28.260 --> 00:53:30.120
So they said, get in the Jeep.

00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:32.100
And the problem
is when you speak

00:53:32.100 --> 00:53:35.610
a foreign language, often
those little connector words

00:53:35.610 --> 00:53:39.102
like, get in, or get over,
are kind of confusing.

00:53:39.102 --> 00:53:40.560
So when they said,
get in the Jeep,

00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:42.570
I thought, great, I'm
going to get in the Jeep.

00:53:42.570 --> 00:53:45.674
And it turned out that
they meant get on the Jeep.

00:53:45.674 --> 00:53:47.340
And what they meant
by "get on the Jeep"

00:53:47.340 --> 00:53:50.640
was that they didn't want me to
be inside, because the back had

00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:52.832
a bunch of rifles in it,
and a bag of Doritos,

00:53:52.832 --> 00:53:53.790
which is kind of weird.

00:53:53.790 --> 00:53:55.164
They didn't want
me to sit there.

00:53:55.164 --> 00:53:57.932
So me and my friend had to
hang onto the running boards.

00:53:57.932 --> 00:54:00.140
And we're hanging onto the
side of the running boards

00:54:00.140 --> 00:54:02.070
and had our hand through the
open sunroof of the Jeep.

00:54:02.070 --> 00:54:03.945
And they're going pretty
slowly at this point

00:54:03.945 --> 00:54:06.930
to drive off this island, where
there's no roads and no cars.

00:54:06.930 --> 00:54:10.740
After we get over the bridge,
we start cruising a little bit,

00:54:10.740 --> 00:54:13.290
and they start throwing popcorn
out through the sunroof,

00:54:13.290 --> 00:54:14.060
because--

00:54:14.060 --> 00:54:15.510
I forgot to tell you this.

00:54:15.510 --> 00:54:17.942
They robbed a popcorn vendor
before we left the venue.

00:54:17.942 --> 00:54:20.400
So these guys are throwing the
popcorn up through the roof,

00:54:20.400 --> 00:54:23.130
and they're trying to get
us to catch it in our mouths

00:54:23.130 --> 00:54:25.209
while we're driving
on the highway.

00:54:25.209 --> 00:54:27.750
We're going 40 miles an hour
and thinking, oh, this is great.

00:54:27.750 --> 00:54:30.240
I should just like tuck and
roll or something, right?

00:54:30.240 --> 00:54:31.991
Except when you're
going 40 miles an hour,

00:54:31.991 --> 00:54:33.865
you're just kind of
thinking, what part of me

00:54:33.865 --> 00:54:35.290
is going to fly
off if I do that?

00:54:35.290 --> 00:54:37.320
So no tucking, no rolling.

00:54:37.320 --> 00:54:39.120
Then I saw the flashing lights.

00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:40.710
Flashing lights, thank god.

00:54:40.710 --> 00:54:42.120
The police are here.

00:54:42.120 --> 00:54:43.650
They're going to pull us over.

00:54:43.650 --> 00:54:45.390
They're going to find out
how ridiculous this is.

00:54:45.390 --> 00:54:46.860
They're going to cut
us loose or they're

00:54:46.860 --> 00:54:48.510
going to send us straight
back to the embassy.

00:54:48.510 --> 00:54:49.870
Worst case, I get deported.

00:54:49.870 --> 00:54:51.210
I can live with that.

00:54:51.210 --> 00:54:51.930
OK.

00:54:51.930 --> 00:54:54.210
The problem is, these
guys unrolled their window

00:54:54.210 --> 00:54:56.070
and did one of
these, and the cops

00:54:56.070 --> 00:54:57.830
turned their lights
off and pulled over

00:54:57.830 --> 00:54:58.830
to the side of the road.

00:54:58.830 --> 00:55:00.990
Because again, black
Jeep, government plates.

00:55:00.990 --> 00:55:03.448
Doesn't matter if we're on the
side trying to catch popcorn

00:55:03.448 --> 00:55:05.040
like a couple of clowns.

00:55:05.040 --> 00:55:07.920
So at this point, I'm
starting to get really scared.

00:55:07.920 --> 00:55:11.820
Because 15 minutes later, we
pull up into this neighborhood.

00:55:11.820 --> 00:55:14.400
Small, boarded up
houses and little things

00:55:14.400 --> 00:55:17.434
with those shutters, those metal
grates are down over the front.

00:55:17.434 --> 00:55:18.600
And I'm thinking, oh my god.

00:55:18.600 --> 00:55:19.760
This is serious.

00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:21.060
This is not harmless fun.

00:55:21.060 --> 00:55:23.520
This isn't just people having
fun with some tourists.

00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:24.780
This is the real deal.

00:55:24.780 --> 00:55:27.750
And I'm cut off from the world,
and I haven't been this scared

00:55:27.750 --> 00:55:29.220
since prom '98--

00:55:29.220 --> 00:55:30.440
different story.

00:55:30.440 --> 00:55:32.736
And I'm like freaking out here.

00:55:32.736 --> 00:55:34.110
I don't want to
get out the Jeep.

00:55:34.110 --> 00:55:35.070
We're off the Jeep.

00:55:35.070 --> 00:55:36.060
I don't want to
get in the house.

00:55:36.060 --> 00:55:38.268
I don't want to go down to
the basement of the house.

00:55:38.268 --> 00:55:39.930
And the guy says, look.

00:55:39.930 --> 00:55:42.510
Get in there, and
everything's going to be OK.

00:55:42.510 --> 00:55:44.310
Pardon me if I don't
believe you, OK?

00:55:44.310 --> 00:55:45.795
But that was the message.

00:55:48.510 --> 00:55:49.760
And at this point, I'm scared.

00:55:49.760 --> 00:55:50.985
I don't know what to do.

00:55:50.985 --> 00:55:51.860
I can't run anywhere.

00:55:51.860 --> 00:55:53.130
I got nowhere to go.

00:55:53.130 --> 00:55:56.410
So we go in, we sit down.

00:55:56.410 --> 00:55:58.280
They're bashing my
friend in, because now he

00:55:58.280 --> 00:56:01.070
decided to play the do you
know who my father is game.

00:56:01.070 --> 00:56:02.790
Works every time.

00:56:02.790 --> 00:56:05.632
And so I'm explaining, look,
I'm an English teacher, man.

00:56:05.632 --> 00:56:08.090
I teach 11-year-old kids and
refugees how to speak English.

00:56:08.090 --> 00:56:10.010
That is it.

00:56:10.010 --> 00:56:11.330
They're calling BS on that.

00:56:11.330 --> 00:56:12.170
You're a spy.

00:56:12.170 --> 00:56:13.479
You're unregistered.

00:56:13.479 --> 00:56:15.020
You're an unregistered
foreign agent.

00:56:15.020 --> 00:56:16.490
Nobody'd heard of that
until Michael Flynn.

00:56:16.490 --> 00:56:17.250
Thanks, Flynn.

00:56:17.250 --> 00:56:19.740
Now I don't have to explain
that one every time.

00:56:19.740 --> 00:56:21.710
So no, we're on our
way to [? Lipa. ?]

00:56:21.710 --> 00:56:23.002
It's got the best food in town.

00:56:23.002 --> 00:56:25.168
I heard they got the best
food anywhere in the city.

00:56:25.168 --> 00:56:25.970
And he gets heated.

00:56:25.970 --> 00:56:28.640
This agent get heated,
and incredulous,

00:56:28.640 --> 00:56:31.640
and a little tense, a little
too close to my face, and says,

00:56:31.640 --> 00:56:34.280
obviously you don't know
anything about Serbian food

00:56:34.280 --> 00:56:37.210
if you think [? Lipa ?] has
the best food in the city.

00:56:37.210 --> 00:56:38.589
And I thought, all right.

00:56:38.589 --> 00:56:40.130
Now we're onto
something better here.

00:56:40.130 --> 00:56:41.810
What about [INAUDIBLE]
on Belgrade?

00:56:41.810 --> 00:56:43.430
Man, look.

00:56:43.430 --> 00:56:44.984
If you haven't
tried [INAUDIBLE],,

00:56:44.984 --> 00:56:46.400
you don't know
anything about this

00:56:46.400 --> 00:56:48.566
and you're not qualified
to talk about Serbian food.

00:56:48.566 --> 00:56:51.707
So I ask him what he
orders when he goes there.

00:56:51.707 --> 00:56:54.290
This is something that changes
the energy of the conversation.

00:56:54.290 --> 00:56:56.060
At Art of Charm, we
call this changing

00:56:56.060 --> 00:56:57.824
the frame of the conversation.

00:56:57.824 --> 00:56:59.240
It goes from me
being interrogated

00:56:59.240 --> 00:57:03.350
by a crazy, deranged,
drunk state security agent

00:57:03.350 --> 00:57:06.870
to a somewhat equal-footing
discussion, if you will,

00:57:06.870 --> 00:57:08.540
on Serbian food and culture.

00:57:08.540 --> 00:57:11.720
And the key is that I kept
behaving like I was in trouble,

00:57:11.720 --> 00:57:14.090
and that everything, even
though he was enraged

00:57:14.090 --> 00:57:16.770
at certain points, even
totally irrationally,

00:57:16.770 --> 00:57:18.790
I'm remaining as completely
calm on the outside,

00:57:18.790 --> 00:57:19.680
anyway, as I can.

00:57:19.680 --> 00:57:22.250
Obviously inside, I'm freaking
out without any regard

00:57:22.250 --> 00:57:23.069
whatsoever.

00:57:23.069 --> 00:57:25.610
Now I ask him look, man, what
do you order when you go there?

00:57:25.610 --> 00:57:27.401
I'm going to go there
tonight-- wink, wink,

00:57:27.401 --> 00:57:28.970
right-- when I get out of here.

00:57:28.970 --> 00:57:30.310
And I'm setting that anchor.

00:57:30.310 --> 00:57:31.310
Man, let me out of here.

00:57:31.310 --> 00:57:33.980
I even invited him to
go with us, seriously.

00:57:33.980 --> 00:57:39.110
Now this type of thing is called
the Benjamin Franklin effect.

00:57:39.110 --> 00:57:41.900
When you ask
somebody for advice,

00:57:41.900 --> 00:57:44.180
when you ask somebody
for recommendations,

00:57:44.180 --> 00:57:46.460
they feel an affinity for you.

00:57:46.460 --> 00:57:49.550
They feel an affinity for
what you are representing.

00:57:49.550 --> 00:57:51.440
They feel an affinity
for helping you.

00:57:51.440 --> 00:57:53.060
And it's a backwards
rationalization

00:57:53.060 --> 00:57:54.500
that they create in the brain.

00:57:54.500 --> 00:57:56.720
Benjamin Franklin used
this really, really well.

00:57:56.720 --> 00:57:58.450
He would borrow books from
people that hated him,

00:57:58.450 --> 00:57:59.699
and they would become friends.

00:57:59.699 --> 00:58:02.210
That's why this is called
the Benjamin Franklin effect.

00:58:02.210 --> 00:58:05.870
So we started talking about
homebrewed liquor called rakia.

00:58:05.870 --> 00:58:08.270
And of course, the only
thing that Serbian people

00:58:08.270 --> 00:58:12.110
like more than talking
about drinking is drinking.

00:58:12.110 --> 00:58:14.420
So I said, I think I could
use a drink right now.

00:58:14.420 --> 00:58:15.920
It's about 8 o'clock
in the morning.

00:58:15.920 --> 00:58:16.970
Don't judge me.

00:58:16.970 --> 00:58:18.470
Desperate times,
desperate measures.

00:58:18.470 --> 00:58:20.450
So he gets up and he suddenly
walks out of the room.

00:58:20.450 --> 00:58:21.616
And I'm thinking, OK, great.

00:58:21.616 --> 00:58:22.520
This is my time.

00:58:22.520 --> 00:58:26.900
Activate eighth grade
taekwondo skills, middle school

00:58:26.900 --> 00:58:27.680
wrestling, sure.

00:58:27.680 --> 00:58:29.270
Leg catch something, right?

00:58:29.270 --> 00:58:31.064
And then [? deek ?]
him out and run.

00:58:31.064 --> 00:58:31.730
That's the plan.

00:58:31.730 --> 00:58:32.960
Sounds good, right?

00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:34.210
What could go wrong?

00:58:34.210 --> 00:58:36.597
And sometimes the unknown
is scarier than the known.

00:58:36.597 --> 00:58:38.180
You don't know what's
going to happen.

00:58:38.180 --> 00:58:38.930
This guy's gone.

00:58:38.930 --> 00:58:41.513
I can hear my friend getting his
butt kicked in the next room.

00:58:41.513 --> 00:58:42.950
He's getting punched.

00:58:42.950 --> 00:58:44.150
It's just awful.

00:58:44.150 --> 00:58:45.890
I'm sitting there
like, it's a good thing

00:58:45.890 --> 00:58:47.060
"Saw" hadn't come
out at this point,

00:58:47.060 --> 00:58:48.268
or I would've been losing it.

00:58:48.268 --> 00:58:49.100
[LAUGHTER]

00:58:49.100 --> 00:58:50.900
There's like sharp
objects in there,

00:58:50.900 --> 00:58:52.276
and pipes coming
out of the wall,

00:58:52.276 --> 00:58:54.733
and these little rusty things
that I'm like, that could get

00:58:54.733 --> 00:58:56.820
attached to a part of my
body if I'm not careful.

00:58:56.820 --> 00:58:59.260
So I see him coming back, and
he's got a club in his hand.

00:58:59.260 --> 00:59:00.470
And I'm like, oh my god.

00:59:00.470 --> 00:59:01.799
This is how it ends.

00:59:01.799 --> 00:59:02.840
And I thought, all right.

00:59:02.840 --> 00:59:05.300
I've got about a
whatever percent

00:59:05.300 --> 00:59:07.790
chance of just getting
away from this guy

00:59:07.790 --> 00:59:10.310
and figuring out how to
dodge it, or tackle him,

00:59:10.310 --> 00:59:11.420
or something like that.

00:59:11.420 --> 00:59:14.450
And about 10 feet
away from me, I

00:59:14.450 --> 00:59:17.570
realize it's not a
club, but a bottle.

00:59:17.570 --> 00:59:19.634
And it's a bottle of rakia.

00:59:19.634 --> 00:59:21.050
And he slams it
down on the table,

00:59:21.050 --> 00:59:23.008
and he pours a couple of
glasses of this stuff.

00:59:23.008 --> 00:59:24.590
And he says, well,
we're just going

00:59:24.590 --> 00:59:26.690
to wait for your friend and
my friend to get done talking.

00:59:26.690 --> 00:59:27.600
And I thought, OK.

00:59:27.600 --> 00:59:29.030
Well, look.

00:59:29.030 --> 00:59:32.270
This is not nice, but this is
an airplane mask situation.

00:59:32.270 --> 00:59:33.830
It's like help
yourself before you

00:59:33.830 --> 00:59:35.690
help other people next to you.

00:59:35.690 --> 00:59:38.191
So I'm wondering how I
can get myself out of this

00:59:38.191 --> 00:59:39.440
and get my friend out of this.

00:59:39.440 --> 00:59:41.390
But so far, I'm pretty
much out of ideas.

00:59:41.390 --> 00:59:44.720
The first idea I have is drink
that shot, and then regroup,

00:59:44.720 --> 00:59:46.340
and then come up
with a new plan.

00:59:46.340 --> 00:59:49.130
So I realize this could
still go sideways.

00:59:49.130 --> 00:59:50.420
This is still happening.

00:59:50.420 --> 00:59:52.070
This is a heated conversation.

00:59:52.070 --> 00:59:53.540
We're going back and forth.

00:59:53.540 --> 00:59:56.690
And finally, I hear
from the next room, hey,

00:59:56.690 --> 00:59:58.100
your friend has a big mouth.

00:59:58.100 --> 00:59:59.240
I'm shutting it for him.

00:59:59.240 --> 01:00:00.590
How's it going over there?

01:00:00.590 --> 01:00:03.890
And these guys don't really know
that I can understand Serbian.

01:00:03.890 --> 01:00:07.490
So I figure, this could really,
really be bad for my friend.

01:00:07.490 --> 01:00:09.410
And it could just as
easily be bad for me.

01:00:09.410 --> 01:00:11.347
Just right now, I
feel OK with it.

01:00:11.347 --> 01:00:12.680
And your brain wants to do that.

01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:14.420
It wants to think
everything's going to be fine,

01:00:14.420 --> 01:00:15.878
everything's going
to be all right.

01:00:15.878 --> 01:00:18.710
Doesn't necessarily mean it
has any basis in reality.

01:00:18.710 --> 01:00:20.060
So I said, look, man.

01:00:20.060 --> 01:00:21.620
I feel really sick.

01:00:21.620 --> 01:00:23.990
I've been awake for a long time.

01:00:23.990 --> 01:00:25.400
You're feeding me this stuff.

01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:26.600
I'm stressed out.

01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:27.410
I'm dehydrated.

01:00:27.410 --> 01:00:29.870
I just need water, and I know
there's no water in there.

01:00:29.870 --> 01:00:31.650
I know those rusty
pipes have no water.

01:00:31.650 --> 01:00:32.790
I know they don't
have any water.

01:00:32.790 --> 01:00:34.970
I know the Jeep doesn't probably
have any water, because they

01:00:34.970 --> 01:00:36.511
finished the beers
they were drinking

01:00:36.511 --> 01:00:38.870
as they drove us to this place.

01:00:38.870 --> 01:00:40.970
So he goes, all right.

01:00:40.970 --> 01:00:42.144
Stay here.

01:00:42.144 --> 01:00:43.060
And I said, of course.

01:00:43.060 --> 01:00:44.750
Where would I go?

01:00:44.750 --> 01:00:47.080
So he gets up, and he
goes in the other room.

01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:49.970
And after a long time--
feels like an eternity--

01:00:49.970 --> 01:00:52.735
I hear the Jeep doors close,
and I realize, they're gone.

01:00:52.735 --> 01:00:54.860
They left, and I don't know
if they're coming back.

01:00:54.860 --> 01:00:55.984
So I go and grab my friend.

01:00:55.984 --> 01:00:56.780
Dude, get up.

01:00:56.780 --> 01:00:57.830
We've got to go.

01:00:57.830 --> 01:01:00.530
He's half limping, half being
carried out of this place.

01:01:00.530 --> 01:01:03.050
And we go to a restaurant
a few hundred meters away,

01:01:03.050 --> 01:01:04.012
a few blocks away.

01:01:04.012 --> 01:01:05.720
And I know what we
must have looked like,

01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:09.380
because were covered in
dirt, and blood, and popcorn.

01:01:09.380 --> 01:01:11.060
And the waitress is
coming up, and she

01:01:11.060 --> 01:01:12.800
goes hi, how can I--
and just immediately

01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:15.050
doesn't even finish the
sentence, starts walking away.

01:01:15.050 --> 01:01:17.210
And I thought, wow,
we look like zombies.

01:01:17.210 --> 01:01:20.660
We look like zombies that we're
junkies when they were alive

01:01:20.660 --> 01:01:22.340
and now are zombies.

01:01:22.340 --> 01:01:25.190
And so the police come-- the
regular police, thank god--

01:01:25.190 --> 01:01:27.710
who take arrest
us again, take us

01:01:27.710 --> 01:01:30.500
to a police station instead of
an underground torture chamber.

01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:31.970
So I'm still ahead here.

01:01:31.970 --> 01:01:33.050
This is good, right?

01:01:33.050 --> 01:01:35.234
And then at this point,
I'm getting interrogated

01:01:35.234 --> 01:01:36.150
by the police captain.

01:01:36.150 --> 01:01:38.030
And he's just like,
what is going--

01:01:38.030 --> 01:01:41.600
where did you even come
from in this town looking

01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:43.370
like this at this hour?

01:01:43.370 --> 01:01:45.440
What is going on here?

01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:48.740
And my spoken Serbian's
not that great, especially

01:01:48.740 --> 01:01:52.920
with a couple bits of booze
in me that hour, no sleep,

01:01:52.920 --> 01:01:53.420
and I'm new.

01:01:53.420 --> 01:01:54.830
I can understand more
than I can speak.

01:01:54.830 --> 01:01:56.630
That's how it goes
with foreign languages.

01:01:56.630 --> 01:01:59.300
So I ask if he spoke
German, and he said, no.

01:01:59.300 --> 01:02:01.940
I don't speak German, but my
girlfriend is a German teacher.

01:02:01.940 --> 01:02:02.570
Thank god.

01:02:02.570 --> 01:02:04.070
So I get on the phone with her.

01:02:04.070 --> 01:02:07.640
I'm on the phone in the
police station in Serbia

01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:10.460
telling a police captain's
girlfriend in German

01:02:10.460 --> 01:02:12.170
what happened to me
when I got arrested

01:02:12.170 --> 01:02:16.100
by their Secret Service, telling
her this ridiculous story.

01:02:16.100 --> 01:02:18.800
Left out the part about
robbing a popcorn vendor.

01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:20.570
And at first she's like, OK.

01:02:20.570 --> 01:02:23.120
I am not sure I believe
anything that you're saying.

01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:26.245
But she's a language teacher,
and I'm a language teacher.

01:02:26.245 --> 01:02:27.370
I'm there to teach English.

01:02:27.370 --> 01:02:29.702
So I start asking her,
look, do you know my boss?

01:02:29.702 --> 01:02:31.660
Do you know the person
who ran this convention?

01:02:31.660 --> 01:02:33.784
Do you know the person who
wrote the textbook where

01:02:33.784 --> 01:02:35.510
I did the English voiceover?

01:02:35.510 --> 01:02:37.070
Do you know the
other teachers that I

01:02:37.070 --> 01:02:39.232
met at these various
mixers for teachers

01:02:39.232 --> 01:02:40.940
when I was teaching
language in Belgrade?

01:02:40.940 --> 01:02:43.060
And that is one her
attitude changed.

01:02:43.060 --> 01:02:45.390
So since we had these
mutual connections,

01:02:45.390 --> 01:02:47.709
she actually believed
what was going on here,

01:02:47.709 --> 01:02:50.250
because she didn't know me, but
she knew people that knew me.

01:02:53.182 --> 01:02:54.640
Again, it's all
about relationship.

01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:56.500
She's not buying who I was.

01:02:56.500 --> 01:02:59.680
She's not buying the story
until she buys who I was.

01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:00.790
So she's embarrassed.

01:03:00.790 --> 01:03:02.581
She's embarrassed on
behalf of the country.

01:03:02.581 --> 01:03:04.660
She tells the police
captain, look, let us go.

01:03:04.660 --> 01:03:06.510
They cut us loose, and they did.

01:03:06.510 --> 01:03:09.850
And we obviously look like
we're up to something, drunk,

01:03:09.850 --> 01:03:12.640
covered in dirt,
blood, and popcorn.

01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:15.220
And so as you can see,
the advanced social skills

01:03:15.220 --> 01:03:17.800
that are taught, this rapport,
this networking concept,

01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:20.600
the ABG, the concepts
that we talked about today

01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:22.780
and the concepts that we
teach at The Art of Charm

01:03:22.780 --> 01:03:25.030
can not only help you keep
your job, get a new job,

01:03:25.030 --> 01:03:27.250
start your business, keep
your side also going,

01:03:27.250 --> 01:03:29.300
or just help you advance
in your personal life.
