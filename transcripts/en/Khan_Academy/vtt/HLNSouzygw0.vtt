00:00:00.217 --> 00:00:02.261
- [Instructor] We're now
going to explore factoring

00:00:02.261 --> 00:00:05.131
a type of expression called
a difference of squares

00:00:05.131 --> 00:00:07.135
and the reason why it's
called a difference of squares

00:00:07.135 --> 00:00:11.506
is 'cause it's expressions
like x squared minus nine.

00:00:11.506 --> 00:00:12.399
This is a difference.

00:00:12.399 --> 00:00:14.119
We're subtracting between two quantities

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:15.687
that are each squares.

00:00:15.687 --> 00:00:18.270
This is literally x squared.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:21.419
Let me do that in a different color.

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:24.836
This is x squared minus three squared.

00:00:29.825 --> 00:00:32.769
It's the difference between two quantities

00:00:32.769 --> 00:00:35.010
that have been squared and it turns out

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.738
that this is pretty
straightforward to factor.

00:00:38.738 --> 00:00:41.968
And to see how it can be factored,

00:00:41.968 --> 00:00:44.347
let me pause there for a second

00:00:44.347 --> 00:00:47.373
and get a little bit of review
of multiplying binomials.

00:00:47.373 --> 00:00:48.990
So put this on the back
burner a little bit.

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.795
Before I give you the answer
of how you factor this,

00:00:51.795 --> 00:00:53.555
let's do a little bit of an exercise.

00:00:53.555 --> 00:00:57.305
Let's multiply x plus a times x minus a

00:00:59.029 --> 00:01:00.582
where a is some number.

00:01:00.582 --> 00:01:01.521
Now, we can use that,

00:01:01.521 --> 00:01:04.054
do that using either the FOIL method

00:01:04.054 --> 00:01:05.159
but I like just thinking of this

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.159
as a distributive property twice.

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:08.915
We could take x plus a

00:01:08.915 --> 00:01:12.642
and distribute it onto
the x and onto the a.

00:01:12.642 --> 00:01:15.013
So when we multiply it by x,

00:01:15.013 --> 00:01:18.448
we would get x times x is x squared,

00:01:18.448 --> 00:01:20.365
a times x is plus ax

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.703
and then when we multiply
it by the negative a,

00:01:24.703 --> 00:01:27.786
well, it'll become negative a times x

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.093
minus a squared.

00:01:31.131 --> 00:01:34.401
So these middle two terms cancel out

00:01:34.401 --> 00:01:37.117
and you are left with x
squared minus a squared.

00:01:37.117 --> 00:01:39.636
You're left with a difference of squares.

00:01:39.636 --> 00:01:41.803
x squared minus a squared.

00:01:43.617 --> 00:01:46.155
So we have an interesting
result right over here

00:01:46.155 --> 00:01:50.410
that x squared minus
a squared is equal to,

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.410
is equal to x plus a,

00:01:53.961 --> 00:01:56.294
x plus a times x minus a.

00:01:59.127 --> 00:02:01.950
And so we can use, and this is for any a.

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.853
So we could use this
pattern now to factor this.

00:02:05.853 --> 00:02:07.651
Here, what is our a?

00:02:07.651 --> 00:02:08.901
Our a is three.

00:02:10.067 --> 00:02:12.315
This is x squared minus three squared

00:02:12.315 --> 00:02:16.575
or we could say minus our a
squared if we say three is a

00:02:16.575 --> 00:02:21.000
and so to factor it, this
is just going to be equal to

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.250
x plus our a which is three

00:02:24.896 --> 00:02:27.641
times x minus our a which is three.

00:02:27.641 --> 00:02:31.450
So x plus three times x minus three.

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.637
Now, let's do some examples
to really reinforce this idea

00:02:34.637 --> 00:02:37.745
of factoring differences of squares.

00:02:37.745 --> 00:02:40.853
So let's say we want to factor,

00:02:40.853 --> 00:02:43.270
let me say y squared minus 25

00:02:46.224 --> 00:02:47.712
and it has to be a difference of squares.

00:02:47.712 --> 00:02:51.139
It doesn't work with a sum of squares.

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:52.171
Well, in this case,

00:02:52.171 --> 00:02:54.584
this is going to be y
and you have to confirm,

00:02:54.584 --> 00:02:56.715
okay, yeah, 25 is five squared

00:02:56.715 --> 00:02:59.377
and y squared is well, y squared.

00:02:59.377 --> 00:03:03.421
So this gonna be y plus
something times y minus something

00:03:03.421 --> 00:03:04.646
and what is that something?

00:03:04.646 --> 00:03:07.795
Well, this right here is five
squared so it's y plus five

00:03:07.795 --> 00:03:09.675
times y minus five

00:03:09.675 --> 00:03:11.723
and the variable doesn't
have to come first.

00:03:11.723 --> 00:03:13.806
We could write 121 minus,

00:03:17.091 --> 00:03:21.317
I'll introduce a new
variable, minus b squared.

00:03:21.317 --> 00:03:22.971
Well, this is a difference of squares

00:03:22.971 --> 00:03:25.138
because 121 is 11 squared.

00:03:26.051 --> 00:03:29.120
So this is going to be 11 plus something

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.486
times 11 minus something and in this case,

00:03:31.486 --> 00:03:35.979
that something is going to be
the thing that was squared.

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:38.479
So 11 plus b times 11 minus b.

00:03:41.183 --> 00:03:45.311
So in general, if you see
a difference of squares,

00:03:45.311 --> 00:03:48.345
one square being subtracted
from another square

00:03:48.345 --> 00:03:50.385
and it could be a numeric perfect square

00:03:50.385 --> 00:03:53.900
or it could be a variable that
has been squared that can be,

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.783
that you could take the square root of.

00:03:55.783 --> 00:03:56.724
Well, then you could say, alright,

00:03:56.724 --> 00:03:58.653
well, that's just gonna be the first thing

00:03:58.653 --> 00:04:02.132
that squared plus the second
thing that has been squared

00:04:02.132 --> 00:04:04.159
times the first thing that was squared

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:06.811
minus the second thing that was squared.

00:04:06.811 --> 00:04:09.507
Now, some common mistakes
that I've seen people do

00:04:09.507 --> 00:04:11.878
including my son when
they first learned this

00:04:11.878 --> 00:04:14.369
is they say, okay, it's easy to recognize

00:04:14.369 --> 00:04:16.050
the difference of squares

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:19.158
but then they say, oh,
is this y squared plus 25

00:04:19.158 --> 00:04:21.711
times y squared minus 25?

00:04:21.711 --> 00:04:24.514
No, the important thing to realize is

00:04:24.514 --> 00:04:26.896
is that what is getting squared?

00:04:26.896 --> 00:04:30.313
Over here, y is the thing getting squared

00:04:31.427 --> 00:04:35.311
and over here it is five
that is getting squared.

00:04:35.311 --> 00:04:37.708
Those are the things
that are getting squared

00:04:37.708 --> 00:04:39.362
in this difference of squares

00:04:39.362 --> 00:04:44.278
and so it's gonna be y plus
five times y minus five.

00:04:44.278 --> 00:04:46.360
I encourage you to just try this out.

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.136
We have a whole practice
section on Khan Academy

00:04:48.136 --> 00:04:52.303
where you can do many many more
of these to become familiar.
