[Music]

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.519
Hey guys, its Yumi here, one of the
participant of Psych2Go.

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:14.740
I hope all of you have been doing well, I
know I’ve been missing but now I'm back.

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.020
You know, life gets tough sometimes, we go
through up and downs but you know, and just

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.260
remember to smile and I promise you everything
will be OK.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:29.720
So, I'm here to say that we have finally hit
2 million subscribers on YouTube and I'm so

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.660
thankful for each and every one of you, and
we couldn't have done it without you guys.

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:42.260
Psych2Go was built as a community of people
or for a community of people to come to during

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:47.530
their hard times, whether it's depression,
anxiety, relationship problems, whatever it

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:53.960
was, we built this company for people to connect
with each other, to relate and know that you're

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.340
not alone.

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:01.059
And I'm so happy and so thankful for each
and every single one of you and it couldn't

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:03.010
have been here without you guys.

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:08.320
So, I'm here to tell you about our great friend,
his name is Coach Bahman and he has recently

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.830
did a video on our Psych2Go magazines and
his YouTube channel is "Your Favorite Coach".

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.630
And what it is is he is a counselor and he
talks to you, it's like he's having a conversation

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.100
with you from heart to heart and he connects
with you by inner peace and positivity.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.210
And honestly, after watching his videos, he
is now my favorite coach and he will soon

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:30.810
be your favorite coach too.

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.620
So, show him some love, go follow him, subscribe
to his channel on his Instagram social media,

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.360
whatever it is and just show him some love
OK?

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.090
But that's it for now and I’ll see you guys
next time, OK?

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.799
Being a parent is probably one of the most
important jobs.

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:52.140
Right now, there's an entire generation of
young children who will one day inherit the

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.229
earth.

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:56.799
Parents aren't just building a family, they're
building the future of our society.

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:00.990
Raising children in a healthy way should be
a huge priority for everyone.

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.909
But the sad truth is that poor parenting is
linked to 10 psychological factors.

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:11.329
Number one; Parents who have gone through
psychological distress are more likely to

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:13.090
mistreat their kids.

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.050
What happens when a parent suffers from serious
mental distress?

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.620
Some psychologists will tell you that parents
affected with psychological distress may treat

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.670
their own children with hostility and rejection.

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.019
For example, they might push their children
away after dealing with something terrible

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:31.700
because they just want to be left alone.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.769
Studies have shown that when parents reject
their children, they cause all kinds of issues

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:37.290
in their little ones.

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.779
These issues include sleep problems and listlessness.

00:02:40.779 --> 00:02:46.120
In this case at least, it seems like the psychological
issues that the parents are facing are projecting

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.719
and harming their children.

00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:54.029
In effect, these children may develop psychological
issues as a result of reoccurring abuse.

00:02:54.029 --> 00:02:59.620
Number two; Depressed parents can show a total
lack of emotion towards their kids.

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.200
Depression is a very common mental disorder,
but what happens when parents develop it?

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.010
How does it affect their children?

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:11.959
One 2018 study revealed that depressed parents
do not show proper sentiments or emotions

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:17.329
towards their children or their feelings about
parenting responsibilities are assumed negative.

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:21.740
To combat this, one researcher proposed a
radically different treatment approach; one

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:26.879
that focused on the entire family unit instead
of the individual alone.

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:32.329
Number three; children show less trust towards
parents with low self-esteem issues.

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:36.189
Low self-esteem is something most of us have
struggled with at some point.

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:40.279
So what happens when children see their parents
suffering from this?

00:03:40.279 --> 00:03:46.140
One study found that low self-esteem had an
impact on the trust between parents and children.

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:51.109
Interesting research shows that self-esteem
radically impact our perception of our own

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:52.109
relationships.

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:56.049
When we have low self-esteem, we might believe
that our relationships are much worse than

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:57.239
they actually are.

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:01.779
Parents might believe that they have a strained
relationship with their children, when really

00:04:01.779 --> 00:04:03.739
it's not all that bad.

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:07.420
Number 4; Poor parenting is linked to early
psychopathy.

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:12.779
A lot of YouTubers right now are talking about
sociopathy and psychopathy, and it's been

00:04:12.779 --> 00:04:14.939
really enlightening.

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:19.320
Psychopathy is characterized by antisocial
and immoral behavior; issues with romantic

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.400
relationships and extreme egocentricity.

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.250
But did you know that early psychopathy can
be caused by poor parenting?

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:33.050
More specifically, one 2017 study stated that
harsh discipline and insensitivity could contribute

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.530
to early psychopathy and other behavioral
problems.

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:39.340
The consequences of this are quite severe.

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:44.919
Many times, parents who try to correct psychopathic
behavior at a young age end up making it worse.

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:49.870
A child's mind is plastic and changeable when
they are young, which means that if intervention

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.620
isn't successful during childhood, psychopathy
could end up being a permanent thing in the

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:55.639
future.

00:04:55.639 --> 00:05:01.210
Number 5; Parents who have been abused as
children can result in less empathy with their

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:02.430
kids.

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.150
Parents raise their kids with an eye to the
past, to their own childhoods.

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:10.509
But what happens if these parents experienced
abuse when they were young?

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:15.020
One study stated that mothers with sexual
abuse history in childhood may suffer from

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:19.710
greater parenting stress, which can lead to
diminished empathy with their own children.

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:24.330
Simply put, this means that mothers who have
been abused have a hard time connecting and

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.400
bonding with their young ones.

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.520
Studies have shown that children who grow
up without a good initial bond are less likely

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:33.040
to be happy and resilient.

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:38.310
Number six; Anxiety disorder in kids is linked
to poor parenting.

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:42.750
Interestingly enough, poor parenting is linked
to anxiety disorder in children.

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:47.449
New research has found that anxiety disorder
is linked to over controlling parents who

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:50.199
don't give their children enough independence.

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:54.849
These children find it hard to control their
own behavior and achieve independence.

00:05:54.849 --> 00:05:58.819
If you've been controlled for your whole life,
it's hard to start taking things into your

00:05:58.819 --> 00:05:59.960
own hands.

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:05.729
Number seven; Irrational and uneducated beliefs
in mothers is linked with more behavioral

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:07.460
problems in their daughters.

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:11.949
Every parent wants to provide their children
with a solid rational education.

00:06:11.949 --> 00:06:15.150
It's one of the most important tools you can
provide your child with.

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:19.090
So, how does education levels in parents impact
their children?

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:23.669
One study came to the conclusion that younger
mothers with lower levels of education are

00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:27.569
more likely to have daughters with behavioral
problems.

00:06:27.569 --> 00:06:32.150
Number eight; Lack of parental warmth is linked
with higher anxiety.

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:36.050
Different parents have different approaches
when it comes to raising their kids.

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:39.360
Some like to be very authoritative while others
like to be more laid-back.

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:45.009
But when it comes to anxiety in children,
a very important factor is how warm parents

00:06:45.009 --> 00:06:46.759
are towards their children.

00:06:46.759 --> 00:06:52.479
This was confirmed by a 2003 study which found
that perceived parental warmth was positively

00:06:52.479 --> 00:06:58.560
associated with active coping and negatively
correlated with trait anxiety in adolescents.

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:04.689
Number nine; Authoritarian parents can cause
their kids to become depersonalized.

00:07:04.689 --> 00:07:08.479
Depersonalization disorder is where people
feel like they're disconnected from their

00:07:08.479 --> 00:07:12.699
own bodies and thoughts, almost like they're
watching themselves from the outside looking

00:07:12.699 --> 00:07:13.810
in.

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:19.419
One study examined multiple different parenting
styles including authoritarian, permissive,

00:07:19.419 --> 00:07:21.050
authoritative and indifferent.

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:26.770
Among other things, they discovered that authoritarian
parents had children which showed higher scores

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:28.789
on depersonalization.

00:07:28.789 --> 00:07:32.990
Number 10; Crime filled neighborhoods are
linked to poor parenting.

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:36.759
First, let's examine what can cause poor parenting.

00:07:36.759 --> 00:07:41.129
Research has shown that a parent who lives
in a bad neighborhood can be severely impacted

00:07:41.129 --> 00:07:45.509
by their environment and this can actually
affect their children in a negative way as

00:07:45.509 --> 00:07:46.509
well.

00:07:46.509 --> 00:07:49.949
Simply put, this means that bad neighborhoods
can result in poor parenting.

00:07:49.949 --> 00:07:50.949
Hey!

00:07:50.949 --> 00:07:55.379
My name is Christian Verzosa, I did the music
and animation for this video and I'm here

00:07:55.379 --> 00:07:57.290
to thank you guys for watching.

00:07:57.290 --> 00:08:00.800
As some of you guys might have noticed, I
do read the comments and occasionally respond

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:03.930
and I couldn't help but notice how many people
out there have discovered something about

00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:06.090
themselves through our videos.

00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:09.789
Given the nature of the previous topic, we
felt it necessary to provide a few different

00:08:09.789 --> 00:08:13.139
resources for anybody who might be going through
some tough times.

00:08:13.139 --> 00:08:17.650
I'd also recommend PantslessPajamas video
on abuse for a more personal take on the subject.

00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:21.690
Like and comment below and know that I mean
it when I say I hope things get better.

00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:23.660
Thanks for watching!
