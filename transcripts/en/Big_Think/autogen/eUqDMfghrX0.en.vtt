out of ten of our kids and low-income

00:01:00.209 --> 00:01:00.219
out of ten of our kids and low-income
 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:02.040
out of ten of our kids and low-income
communities will actually graduate from

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:02.050
communities will actually graduate from
 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.350
communities will actually graduate from
college so we've all come to this saying

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360
college so we've all come to this saying
 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.350
college so we've all come to this saying
this shouldn't exist like we have to do

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360
this shouldn't exist like we have to do
 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.060
this shouldn't exist like we have to do
something about this and I think what

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.070
something about this and I think what
 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.219
something about this and I think what
has happened to us is that we've come to

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:11.229
has happened to us is that we've come to
 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:14.190
has happened to us is that we've come to
realize not only should we do something

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200
realize not only should we do something
 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.290
realize not only should we do something
about it we actually could do something

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:16.300
about it we actually could do something
 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.010
about it we actually could do something
about it and and really we could attain

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020
about it and and really we could attain
 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.230
about it and and really we could attain
a world where all the kids in our

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240
a world where all the kids in our
 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.180
a world where all the kids in our
country have the chance to attain an

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.190
country have the chance to attain an
 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.520
country have the chance to attain an
excellent education and I think what's

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530
excellent education and I think what's
 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.700
excellent education and I think what's
led us to that initially was what we saw

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710
led us to that initially was what we saw
 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.370
led us to that initially was what we saw
from initially a fraction of our core

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380
from initially a fraction of our core
 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.039
from initially a fraction of our core
members who going through their own

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:35.049
members who going through their own
 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:36.810
members who going through their own
learning curves figured out how to

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820
learning curves figured out how to
 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.240
learning curves figured out how to
actually put their kids on a different

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250
actually put their kids on a different
 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.690
actually put their kids on a different
trajectory you know so now today because

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700
trajectory you know so now today because
 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.640
trajectory you know so now today because
we've learned so much from the initially

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:44.650
we've learned so much from the initially
 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.340
we've learned so much from the initially
small fraction of teachers who were

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350
small fraction of teachers who were
 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.830
small fraction of teachers who were
affecting dramatic gains and their kids

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840
affecting dramatic gains and their kids
 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.300
affecting dramatic gains and their kids
achievement you know we've learned a lot

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310
achievement you know we've learned a lot
 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.070
achievement you know we've learned a lot
from them and have fed those lessons

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080
from them and have fed those lessons
 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.780
from them and have fed those lessons
back into our training and support

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:54.790
back into our training and support
 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:56.340
back into our training and support
models and and I've reached a point

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350
models and and I've reached a point
 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.819
models and and I've reached a point
where now many more of our teachers are

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829
where now many more of our teachers are
 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.920
where now many more of our teachers are
extremely successful with their kids and

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:01.930
extremely successful with their kids and
 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.819
extremely successful with their kids and
so now we see evidence across any sort

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:05.829
so now we see evidence across any sort
 

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:08.340
so now we see evidence across any sort
of community from remote rural areas to

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.350
of community from remote rural areas to
 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.490
of community from remote rural areas to
our hardest pressed urban areas you know

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500
our hardest pressed urban areas you know
 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.680
our hardest pressed urban areas you know
at the elementary level middle school

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690
at the elementary level middle school
 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.080
at the elementary level middle school
level at high school level we see just

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090
level at high school level we see just
 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.690
level at high school level we see just
hardcore evidence that when kids are

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700
hardcore evidence that when kids are
 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.069
hardcore evidence that when kids are
given the opportunities they deserve

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:20.079
given the opportunities they deserve
 

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:24.210
given the opportunities they deserve
they excel you know kids facing some of

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220
they excel you know kids facing some of
 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.670
they excel you know kids facing some of
the greatest challenges

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680
the greatest challenges
 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.149
the greatest challenges
poverty in in our country so seeing that

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:29.159
poverty in in our country so seeing that
 

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:31.160
poverty in in our country so seeing that
at the classroom level and and now

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170
at the classroom level and and now
 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.599
at the classroom level and and now
seeing through you know a number of our

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:34.609
seeing through you know a number of our
 

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:40.099
seeing through you know a number of our
alums would teach very successful and

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:40.109
alums would teach very successful and
 

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:42.679
alums would teach very successful and
see their kids going off into nearby

00:02:42.679 --> 00:02:42.689
see their kids going off into nearby
 

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:45.530
see their kids going off into nearby
middle schools or whatever and would see

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540
middle schools or whatever and would see
 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.240
middle schools or whatever and would see
that those schools weren't giving the

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250
that those schools weren't giving the
 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.490
that those schools weren't giving the
kids the opportunities really that they

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500
kids the opportunities really that they
 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.199
kids the opportunities really that they
deserve to continue on the new

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209
deserve to continue on the new
 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.179
deserve to continue on the new
trajectory and and that led a number of

00:02:53.179 --> 00:02:53.189
trajectory and and that led a number of
 

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:55.459
trajectory and and that led a number of
them to go out and pioneer these very

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:55.469
them to go out and pioneer these very
 

00:02:55.469 --> 00:02:58.640
them to go out and pioneer these very
high performing charter schools you know

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650
high performing charter schools you know
 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.409
high performing charter schools you know
and there are many others in the country

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:00.419
and there are many others in the country
 

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:03.729
and there are many others in the country
now as well who who are you know growing

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739
now as well who who are you know growing
 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:06.349
now as well who who are you know growing
this generation of schools and

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:06.359
this generation of schools and
 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:08.089
this generation of schools and
low-income communities that are taking

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:08.099
low-income communities that are taking
 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:10.789
low-income communities that are taking
you know whole schools full of kids in

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799
you know whole schools full of kids in
 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:12.440
you know whole schools full of kids in
in low-income communities and putting

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450
in low-income communities and putting
 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.089
in low-income communities and putting
them on a track to graduating from

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:14.099
them on a track to graduating from
 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:17.000
them on a track to graduating from
college and so now we see not only at a

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010
college and so now we see not only at a
 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.490
college and so now we see not only at a
classroom level but at whole school

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500
classroom level but at whole school
 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.220
classroom level but at whole school
levels that it is completely possible to

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230
levels that it is completely possible to
 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.860
levels that it is completely possible to
do this and so whereas you know I think

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870
do this and so whereas you know I think
 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.520
do this and so whereas you know I think
back to 15 years ago you know I think

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530
back to 15 years ago you know I think
 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.649
back to 15 years ago you know I think
that the public evidence we had that it

00:03:30.649 --> 00:03:30.659
that the public evidence we had that it
 

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:32.899
that the public evidence we had that it
was possible to take kids growing up in

00:03:32.899 --> 00:03:32.909
was possible to take kids growing up in
 

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:34.789
was possible to take kids growing up in
urban in rural areas and actually put

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799
urban in rural areas and actually put
 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:37.280
urban in rural areas and actually put
them truly on a level playing field was

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290
them truly on a level playing field was
 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.710
them truly on a level playing field was
the movie Stand and Deliver remember you

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720
the movie Stand and Deliver remember you
 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.520
the movie Stand and Deliver remember you
know Jaime Escalante the the teacher in

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530
know Jaime Escalante the the teacher in
 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.170
know Jaime Escalante the the teacher in
South Central Los Angeles who two of the

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180
South Central Los Angeles who two of the
 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.449
South Central Los Angeles who two of the
classic kids and got them to pass the AP

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459
classic kids and got them to pass the AP
 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.580
classic kids and got them to pass the AP
calculus exam I mean incredibly

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590
calculus exam I mean incredibly
 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.860
calculus exam I mean incredibly
inspiring story but I think at some

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870
inspiring story but I think at some
 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.449
inspiring story but I think at some
level I think the movie served the

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459
level I think the movie served the
 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:56.030
level I think the movie served the
purpose of making it seem like here was

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040
purpose of making it seem like here was
 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.759
purpose of making it seem like here was
this one person who was who's just a

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769
this one person who was who's just a
 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:01.729
this one person who was who's just a
hero you know and and and many many

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739
hero you know and and and many many

something you know that we couldn't
 

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:08.240
something you know that we couldn't
figure out like something magical or

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250
figure out like something magical or
 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.479
figure out like something magical or
elusive about that teachers impact and I

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489
elusive about that teachers impact and I
 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:14.479
elusive about that teachers impact and I
think you know you could probably count

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489
think you know you could probably count
 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:16.430
think you know you could probably count
on one hand and even that is generous

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440
on one hand and even that is generous
 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.770
on one hand and even that is generous

that the number of schools 15 years ago
that we're taking whole schools full of

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400
that we're taking whole schools full of
 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.370
that we're taking whole schools full of
kids and putting them on a level playing

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380
kids and putting them on a level playing
 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.110
kids and putting them on a level playing
field and I just think wow you know how

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120
field and I just think wow you know how
 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.640
field and I just think wow you know how
far we have come in 15 years where you

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650
far we have come in 15 years where you
 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.560
far we have come in 15 years where you
know we ourselves just within the

context of Teach for America and
 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:33.260
context of Teach for America and
certainly there are many successful

certainly there are many successful
 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:34.850

but we could point to hundreds of

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:37.200
but we could point to hundreds of
 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.749
but we could point to hundreds of
teachers who have

00:04:38.749 --> 00:04:38.759
teachers who have

affected just dramatic gains in their
 

00:04:41.249 --> 00:04:44.450
affected just dramatic gains in their
students achievement levels and we could

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460
students achievement levels and we could
 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.429
students achievement levels and we could
explain exactly how they do that we know

00:04:46.429 --> 00:04:46.439
explain exactly how they do that we know
 

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:48.559
explain exactly how they do that we know
today that there's nothing magical and

00:04:48.559 --> 00:04:48.569
today that there's nothing magical and
 

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:51.019
today that there's nothing magical and
nothing elusive about attaining real

00:04:51.019 --> 00:04:51.029
nothing elusive about attaining real

there's no there's no way around the
very hard work of getting it done but

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:01.889
very hard work of getting it done but
 

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:04.070
very hard work of getting it done but
there's nothing elusive about it and and

there's nothing elusive about it and and

today there are thought to be 200

today there are thought to be 200

today there are thought to be 200
schools in low-income communities that

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610
schools in low-income communities that
 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:10.189
schools in low-income communities that
are really accomplishing this at a whole

00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:10.199
are really accomplishing this at a whole
 

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:12.619
are really accomplishing this at a whole
school level so the conversation today

00:05:12.619 --> 00:05:12.629
school level so the conversation today
 

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:14.689
school level so the conversation today
is completely different you know whereas

is completely different you know whereas

is completely different you know whereas
before we were trying to figure out can

00:05:16.999 --> 00:05:17.009
before we were trying to figure out can
 

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:19.399
before we were trying to figure out can
this be done on any sort of scale today

00:05:19.399 --> 00:05:19.409
this be done on any sort of scale today
 

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:22.249
this be done on any sort of scale today
we know this can be done and and the

00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:22.259
we know this can be done and and the
 

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:24.439
we know this can be done and and the
question is really just okay how do we

00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:24.449
question is really just okay how do we
 

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:27.260
question is really just okay how do we
how do we affect the system level change

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:27.270
how do we affect the system level change

how do we affect the system level change
is necessary to truly ensure that all

is necessary to truly ensure that all

kids have access to teachers and schools
that will put them on a level playing
