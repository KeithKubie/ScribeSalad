00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.660
- We're moving more into

00:00:16.684 --> 00:00:19.934
clinical aspects of different things...

00:00:21.183 --> 00:00:23.829
The latter part of this morning.

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:25.180
But wasn't that fun?

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:26.013
My...

00:00:29.243 --> 00:00:31.743
I am very pleased to introduce

00:00:34.641 --> 00:00:36.285
Ms. Cathleen Small,

00:00:36.285 --> 00:00:37.729
who is a parent-advocate,

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:41.558
and the Medical Outreach
Alliance Coordinator

00:00:41.558 --> 00:00:46.428
for the Down Syndrome
Connection of the Bay Area.

00:00:46.428 --> 00:00:48.429
She's also on the board of the

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:50.855
Down Syndrome Diagnosis Network,

00:00:50.855 --> 00:00:54.534
and works with Bay Area
hospitals and medical providers

00:00:54.534 --> 00:00:57.235
to help support families who are welcoming

00:00:57.235 --> 00:00:59.485
a child with Down syndrome.

00:01:00.594 --> 00:01:01.427
Cathleen,

00:01:01.427 --> 00:01:02.260
welcome.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:03.373
For the first time,

00:01:03.373 --> 00:01:04.540
to our podium.

00:01:06.592 --> 00:01:07.450
- Thanks.

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.033
- Glad to have you.

00:01:11.284 --> 00:01:12.117
- Hello.

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:16.895
So apparently the first
thing that I need to tell you

00:01:16.895 --> 00:01:19.330
is that I have nothing to disclose,

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.697
but that my husband works for Genentech.

00:01:21.697 --> 00:01:23.435
But I couldn't tell you what he does.

00:01:23.435 --> 00:01:24.353
It's something really,

00:01:24.353 --> 00:01:25.186
really,

00:01:25.186 --> 00:01:28.769
really dull about
regulatory FDA paperwork.

00:01:29.638 --> 00:01:31.446
So anyway...

00:01:31.446 --> 00:01:32.729
No disclosures.

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.616
So you can see here,

00:01:34.616 --> 00:01:36.429
our goals for this presentation.

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:37.524
Let me tell you a little bit about

00:01:37.524 --> 00:01:40.072
how I got involved with
Down Syndrome Connection.

00:01:40.072 --> 00:01:41.187
I have two children.

00:01:41.187 --> 00:01:42.890
My older one is autistic.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.503
And my younger one has Down syndrome.

00:01:46.503 --> 00:01:47.855
Both boys.

00:01:47.855 --> 00:01:49.142
When my younger one was born,

00:01:49.142 --> 00:01:51.727
we got a birth diagnosis at the hospital.

00:01:51.727 --> 00:01:55.787
And our diagnosis
experience was not terrific.

00:01:55.787 --> 00:01:57.714
And one of the first things I thought was,

00:01:57.714 --> 00:01:58.547
"Wow,

00:01:58.547 --> 00:02:00.044
this didn't have to be this way.

00:02:00.044 --> 00:02:02.050
Someday I'm gonna try to do something

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:03.935
to make sure it doesn't happen this way

00:02:03.935 --> 00:02:05.363
for other parents."

00:02:05.363 --> 00:02:10.246
So then I connected with
Down Syndrome Connection.

00:02:10.246 --> 00:02:11.233
We went to a lot of their programs

00:02:11.233 --> 00:02:12.269
and that kind of thing.

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:13.482
And then after a while,

00:02:13.482 --> 00:02:15.098
we got to talking and they said,

00:02:15.098 --> 00:02:15.931
"You know,

00:02:15.931 --> 00:02:18.200
we need to ramp up our medical outreach.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.655
Because we've been in
this area for 20 years.

00:02:20.655 --> 00:02:22.464
And there's a lot of
people at the hospitals

00:02:22.464 --> 00:02:24.791
that don't even know we're out there."

00:02:24.791 --> 00:02:25.624
And I said,

00:02:25.624 --> 00:02:26.457
"Sign me up.

00:02:26.457 --> 00:02:28.178
That's exactly what I've
been wanting to do."

00:02:28.178 --> 00:02:29.289
So that's what I've been doing.

00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:30.780
I've been going around to the hospitals,

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.628
and to medical groups
and obstectrics groups,

00:02:34.628 --> 00:02:35.576
and genetics groups,

00:02:35.576 --> 00:02:37.326
giving presentations.

00:02:38.298 --> 00:02:40.906
And I generally tailor it
for whoever I'm talking to,

00:02:40.906 --> 00:02:42.513
so when I'm talking to doctors,

00:02:42.513 --> 00:02:44.539
I usually leave out the
slides that are like,

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:45.998
"What is a trisomy?"

00:02:45.998 --> 00:02:47.808
Because they all know what trisomy is.

00:02:47.808 --> 00:02:48.768
I don't need to tell them that.

00:02:48.768 --> 00:02:51.531
When I'm talking to people
that maybe aren't as familiar,

00:02:51.531 --> 00:02:53.514
I give a basic overview.

00:02:53.514 --> 00:02:54.347
So today,

00:02:54.347 --> 00:02:55.208
because we've got a mix,

00:02:55.208 --> 00:02:56.997
I'm gonna give a basic overview.

00:02:56.997 --> 00:02:59.494
And Dr. Trotter is
going to speak after me,

00:02:59.494 --> 00:03:00.988
in a lot more detail,

00:03:00.988 --> 00:03:03.888
since he spent much of his practice

00:03:03.888 --> 00:03:06.206
working with people with disabilities.

00:03:06.206 --> 00:03:09.216
So I will gloss over it and
if it is a review for you,

00:03:09.216 --> 00:03:13.049
I apologize but I will
try to keep that quick.

00:03:14.256 --> 00:03:16.117
So here's our little Down syndrome 101.

00:03:16.117 --> 00:03:18.246
It is the most common genetic condition,

00:03:18.246 --> 00:03:21.749
occurring in one in 691 births in the US,

00:03:21.749 --> 00:03:22.749
so we think.

00:03:23.665 --> 00:03:25.613
An estimated 6,000 births a year,

00:03:25.613 --> 00:03:29.162
and more than 200,000
people with Down syndrome

00:03:29.162 --> 00:03:32.254
are estimated to be living in
the United States right now.

00:03:32.254 --> 00:03:33.999
This is the most recent number.

00:03:33.999 --> 00:03:34.832
Until recently,

00:03:34.832 --> 00:03:37.363
they thought it was
somewhere around 400,000

00:03:37.363 --> 00:03:40.199
and then they just did a
study that came out last year,

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:43.292
saying it's closer to 200,000.

00:03:43.292 --> 00:03:44.724
It's present in all races,

00:03:44.724 --> 00:03:46.844
all socioeconomic backgrounds,

00:03:46.844 --> 00:03:49.678
equally common in both genders.

00:03:49.678 --> 00:03:51.778
And there's no known cause for it.

00:03:51.778 --> 00:03:56.606
It's just extra genetic material
in the egg or the sperm.

00:03:56.606 --> 00:03:58.549
And it's present from
the moment of conception.

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:01.118
So it's nothing that a mother
did while she was pregnant,

00:04:01.118 --> 00:04:03.314
or didn't do while she was pregnant.

00:04:03.314 --> 00:04:06.012
There's no blame to be placed.

00:04:06.012 --> 00:04:07.123
Sometimes parents feel like,

00:04:07.123 --> 00:04:09.179
"What did I do wrong?"

00:04:09.179 --> 00:04:10.012
It just happens.

00:04:10.012 --> 00:04:10.929
It just is.

00:04:12.374 --> 00:04:14.472
So there's three types of Down syndrome.

00:04:14.472 --> 00:04:16.795
Almost all of them are trisomy 21,

00:04:16.795 --> 00:04:20.409
which is just an extra copy
of the 21st chromosome.

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:22.496
The less common ones are translocation,

00:04:22.496 --> 00:04:24.711
where a piece of the chromosome breaks off

00:04:24.711 --> 00:04:27.177
and usually attaches
to another chromosome.

00:04:27.177 --> 00:04:28.010
Or mosaicism,

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:31.566
where not every cell in
the body is affected.

00:04:31.566 --> 00:04:32.756
In trisomy 21,

00:04:32.756 --> 00:04:35.203
every single cell in the body is affected.

00:04:35.203 --> 00:04:36.286
In mosaicism,

00:04:37.345 --> 00:04:38.302
not all are.

00:04:38.302 --> 00:04:41.307
And the percentage that are
affected in individuals differs.

00:04:41.307 --> 00:04:46.173
Neither of those second two
types is very common at all.

00:04:46.173 --> 00:04:48.863
Physical characteristics...

00:04:48.863 --> 00:04:50.652
Not every person with Down syndrome

00:04:50.652 --> 00:04:51.980
is gonna show all of these.

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:53.597
Some people show more than others.

00:04:53.597 --> 00:04:54.430
In general,

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.896
most of them tend to have low muscle tone,

00:04:56.896 --> 00:04:58.145
hypotonia.

00:04:58.145 --> 00:04:59.468
So they're kind of floppy babies

00:04:59.468 --> 00:05:02.325
that sort of melt into
you when you pick them up.

00:05:02.325 --> 00:05:03.952
They have the epicanthal folds

00:05:03.952 --> 00:05:05.499
on the inner corner of the eyes

00:05:05.499 --> 00:05:08.504
that give it an almond shape.

00:05:08.504 --> 00:05:09.956
Flat nasal bridge.

00:05:09.956 --> 00:05:11.093
That's something that sometimes

00:05:11.093 --> 00:05:14.098
is seen in the 20-week ultrasound.

00:05:14.098 --> 00:05:15.054
I know parents have said that it's

00:05:15.054 --> 00:05:16.530
been pointed out to them sometimes

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:18.914
in their anatomy scan.

00:05:18.914 --> 00:05:19.747
Small,

00:05:19.747 --> 00:05:21.815
or unusually shaped ears.

00:05:21.815 --> 00:05:23.680
Excess skin at the back of the neck.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:24.513
That,

00:05:24.513 --> 00:05:25.346
too,

00:05:25.346 --> 00:05:26.248
sometimes shows up in an ultrasound.

00:05:26.248 --> 00:05:27.589
Not always.

00:05:27.589 --> 00:05:29.561
A tongue that protrudes or seems large

00:05:29.561 --> 00:05:32.586
compared to the size of the mouth.

00:05:32.586 --> 00:05:33.987
So the mouth can actually be pretty small,

00:05:33.987 --> 00:05:35.877
but the tongue can be normal sized,

00:05:35.877 --> 00:05:38.294
which makes it appear bigger.

00:05:39.134 --> 00:05:40.436
And then with the low muscle tone,

00:05:40.436 --> 00:05:41.519
your tongue being a muscle,

00:05:41.519 --> 00:05:42.352
of course,

00:05:42.352 --> 00:05:44.349
it can be harder for them to keep it in

00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:46.941
like most of us just naturally do.

00:05:46.941 --> 00:05:48.202
They actually have to work at that.

00:05:48.202 --> 00:05:49.604
So that's where you get a little bit

00:05:49.604 --> 00:05:52.137
of the tongue protrusion going on.

00:05:52.137 --> 00:05:54.420
White spots on the
colored part of the eye,

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:56.208
called Brushfield's spots.

00:05:56.208 --> 00:05:57.322
Those are actually really lovely

00:05:57.322 --> 00:05:58.559
if you've ever seen them.

00:05:58.559 --> 00:06:00.068
They make the eyes kind of sparkle.

00:06:00.068 --> 00:06:01.757
They're really beautiful.

00:06:01.757 --> 00:06:04.420
Single deep crease across
the palm of the hand.

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:07.148
And an extra space between
the first and second toes,

00:06:07.148 --> 00:06:08.981
called the sandal gap.

00:06:10.111 --> 00:06:10.944
Like I said,

00:06:10.944 --> 00:06:11.811
not all of these are gonna show up

00:06:11.811 --> 00:06:14.016
in every person with Down syndrome.

00:06:14.016 --> 00:06:16.868
Not all are gonna show
up in that ultrasound.

00:06:16.868 --> 00:06:19.259
My ultrasound showed absolutely nothing.

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:21.936
But my son does have a very
flat little nasal bridge.

00:06:21.936 --> 00:06:24.436
So it didn't show up in there.

00:06:25.673 --> 00:06:29.177
Medical concerns in
babies and young children.

00:06:29.177 --> 00:06:30.772
So some babies with Down syndrome are

00:06:30.772 --> 00:06:32.940
born with absolutely no health concerns.

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:35.035
Down syndrome is the only
thing they're born with

00:06:35.035 --> 00:06:37.197
other than a typical child.

00:06:37.197 --> 00:06:38.030
Otherwise,

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:39.704
they're like a typical child.

00:06:39.704 --> 00:06:43.137
But 50% are born with
congenital heart problems.

00:06:43.137 --> 00:06:43.970
So obviously,

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:46.537
this is really scary for parents.

00:06:46.537 --> 00:06:48.152
It doesn't entirely have to be.

00:06:48.152 --> 00:06:50.055
A heart condition is
always going to be scary.

00:06:50.055 --> 00:06:54.148
But we've come so far that
so many of these babies

00:06:54.148 --> 00:06:57.017
have a perfectly successful heart surgery.

00:06:57.017 --> 00:06:57.850
And yeah,

00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:59.726
it's terrifying for the
family to go through it.

00:06:59.726 --> 00:07:00.968
But they come out the other side.

00:07:00.968 --> 00:07:04.468
the children live a long and healthy life.

00:07:05.588 --> 00:07:07.437
Hearing problems.

00:07:07.437 --> 00:07:08.588
Semi-common.

00:07:08.588 --> 00:07:10.113
Obstructive sleep apnea,

00:07:10.113 --> 00:07:10.946
again.

00:07:10.946 --> 00:07:12.398
The intestinal issues,

00:07:12.398 --> 00:07:16.428
gastrointestinal atresia
and Hirschprung's.

00:07:16.428 --> 00:07:19.184
The atresia will show up
before they leave the hospital.

00:07:19.184 --> 00:07:20.017
Don't quote me on this,

00:07:20.017 --> 00:07:22.411
but I think in virtually every case.

00:07:22.411 --> 00:07:24.043
I have heard of people with Hirschprung's

00:07:24.043 --> 00:07:26.608
not knowing it before
they leave the hospital.

00:07:26.608 --> 00:07:28.781
But it's probably gonna be apparent

00:07:28.781 --> 00:07:30.575
fairly early on.

00:07:30.575 --> 00:07:31.965
Thyroid dysfunction.

00:07:31.965 --> 00:07:33.000
Pretty common.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.199
It often shows up later,

00:07:34.199 --> 00:07:35.558
but sometimes in young kids.

00:07:35.558 --> 00:07:37.874
My son has had it almost his whole life.

00:07:37.874 --> 00:07:39.926
So it does show up in really young kids.

00:07:39.926 --> 00:07:43.013
Leukemia is the one
that scares all parents

00:07:43.013 --> 00:07:44.413
of kids with Down syndrome,

00:07:44.413 --> 00:07:47.554
and if you see kids with Down
syndrome in your practice,

00:07:47.554 --> 00:07:49.087
or in your medical office,

00:07:49.087 --> 00:07:51.678
you're undoubtedly gonna
see a parent who rushes in

00:07:51.678 --> 00:07:53.888
with a child with a rash and goes,

00:07:53.888 --> 00:07:54.721
"Is it petechia?

00:07:54.721 --> 00:07:56.237
Could it be leukemia? "

00:07:56.237 --> 00:07:57.918
Because this is what we all worry about

00:07:57.918 --> 00:07:59.221
and this is what we take pictures of

00:07:59.221 --> 00:08:01.381
and send them around to our
friends on the internet,

00:08:01.381 --> 00:08:02.214
and go,

00:08:02.214 --> 00:08:04.815
"Does this look like petechia to you?"

00:08:04.815 --> 00:08:05.648
We get over it.

00:08:05.648 --> 00:08:07.268
Eventually we realize that some of us

00:08:07.268 --> 00:08:09.513
have kids that are just rashy kids,

00:08:09.513 --> 00:08:11.893
that get a rash every
time they get a fever.

00:08:11.893 --> 00:08:13.792
And it doesn't necessarily mean leukemia.

00:08:13.792 --> 00:08:14.995
But I will admit that some of us

00:08:14.995 --> 00:08:16.270
are quite paranoid about it.

00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:18.803
So you will probably hear about it.

00:08:18.803 --> 00:08:20.330
Nursing and feeding difficulties.

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:21.437
Also very common.

00:08:21.437 --> 00:08:23.027
But not insurmountable.

00:08:23.027 --> 00:08:25.364
There are a lot of kids with Down syndrome

00:08:25.364 --> 00:08:27.917
who are able to successfully breastfeed.

00:08:27.917 --> 00:08:28.750
For most,

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:29.925
it does take some work.

00:08:29.925 --> 00:08:31.535
And there are lactation consultants

00:08:31.535 --> 00:08:34.555
that are skilled in teaching the parents

00:08:34.555 --> 00:08:36.611
how to work with this.

00:08:36.611 --> 00:08:37.757
A lot of it has to do with

00:08:37.757 --> 00:08:39.638
the low muscle tone in the mouth.

00:08:39.638 --> 00:08:40.798
It's hard for them to form that

00:08:40.798 --> 00:08:42.523
good suction with the breast when

00:08:42.523 --> 00:08:43.932
they're trying to breastfeed.

00:08:43.932 --> 00:08:45.406
And it just takes time.

00:08:45.406 --> 00:08:47.508
It takes building up that muscle tone,

00:08:47.508 --> 00:08:48.741
building up the endurance.

00:08:48.741 --> 00:08:50.805
A lot of them are very sleepy babies,

00:08:50.805 --> 00:08:52.293
especially if they have a heart condition.

00:08:52.293 --> 00:08:54.932
And they fall asleep while
nursing all the time.

00:08:54.932 --> 00:08:56.648
But if a parent really wants to nurse

00:08:56.648 --> 00:08:57.878
a child with Down syndrome,

00:08:57.878 --> 00:09:00.880
chances are they will
eventually be able to,

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:03.547
if they have the proper support.

00:09:05.146 --> 00:09:07.454
In older children and adults,

00:09:07.454 --> 00:09:10.164
atlantoaxial instability is an issue

00:09:10.164 --> 00:09:11.351
with the cervical spine.

00:09:11.351 --> 00:09:12.829
It's not really that common,

00:09:12.829 --> 00:09:14.275
as far as I know.

00:09:14.275 --> 00:09:15.637
I do not know many people with it.

00:09:15.637 --> 00:09:17.001
But it does exist.

00:09:17.001 --> 00:09:18.385
And usually they say,

00:09:18.385 --> 00:09:20.140
if a child with Down syndrome is

00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:21.941
gonna get involved in
something like gymnastics,

00:09:21.941 --> 00:09:22.973
or horseback riding,

00:09:22.973 --> 00:09:25.037
it could have a lot of impact on the neck.

00:09:25.037 --> 00:09:27.714
They should have that x-rayed

00:09:27.714 --> 00:09:30.242
and make sure that they
don't have the AAI.

00:09:30.242 --> 00:09:33.224
They used to say it should
be done by age three.

00:09:33.224 --> 00:09:35.498
The most recent guidelines I've seen said

00:09:35.498 --> 00:09:37.189
you can maybe wait till five.

00:09:37.189 --> 00:09:38.468
That might actually be better.

00:09:38.468 --> 00:09:40.042
So it's seems to be a little bit in flux,

00:09:40.042 --> 00:09:41.767
from what I've seen.

00:09:41.767 --> 00:09:42.600
Vision problems,

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:43.704
fairly common.

00:09:43.704 --> 00:09:44.537
Autism.

00:09:44.537 --> 00:09:49.181
We all know that's rising
among the entire population.

00:09:49.181 --> 00:09:50.046
And in Down syndrome,

00:09:50.046 --> 00:09:52.701
it is more common in boys than in girls.

00:09:52.701 --> 00:09:54.861
Just like in the standard population.

00:09:54.861 --> 00:09:57.240
It does seem to be a bit on the rise,

00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:59.752
in that population as well.

00:09:59.752 --> 00:10:01.053
Precocious puberty,

00:10:01.053 --> 00:10:02.886
early-onset menopause.

00:10:04.586 --> 00:10:05.475
This is not going to happen to

00:10:05.475 --> 00:10:06.841
everyone with Down syndrome.

00:10:06.841 --> 00:10:08.947
But it can happen.

00:10:08.947 --> 00:10:10.733
Celiac disease,

00:10:10.733 --> 00:10:12.342
not terrifically common,

00:10:12.342 --> 00:10:13.893
but more common in Down syndrome

00:10:13.893 --> 00:10:16.709
than in the typical population.

00:10:16.709 --> 00:10:18.641
So it is something to be aware of

00:10:18.641 --> 00:10:20.715
if a patient is presenting with

00:10:20.715 --> 00:10:23.498
a lot of gastrointestinal issues.

00:10:23.498 --> 00:10:25.088
Dementia and Alzheimer's disease.

00:10:25.088 --> 00:10:25.921
Next to leukemia,

00:10:25.921 --> 00:10:26.754
I'll tell you,

00:10:26.754 --> 00:10:28.312
this is the other thing we all fear.

00:10:28.312 --> 00:10:29.802
Because it's a horrible thought,

00:10:29.802 --> 00:10:31.197
knowing that you are going to see

00:10:31.197 --> 00:10:34.619
your child slide into dementia someday.

00:10:34.619 --> 00:10:35.452
My personal hope,

00:10:35.452 --> 00:10:37.370
as the parent of a young child,

00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:39.324
is that I've got about 30,

00:10:39.324 --> 00:10:42.861
35 years before we start
to see signs of this.

00:10:42.861 --> 00:10:46.403
And that's a lot of time
for medicine to advance.

00:10:46.403 --> 00:10:48.823
So anyone out there in research,

00:10:48.823 --> 00:10:49.883
you wanna work on this?

00:10:49.883 --> 00:10:51.133
I'm all for it.

00:10:52.451 --> 00:10:55.229
So the AAP has guidelines
for the recommended

00:10:55.229 --> 00:10:57.795
screenings at children
with Down syndrome's

00:10:57.795 --> 00:10:58.628
well-baby,

00:10:58.628 --> 00:11:00.019
well-child checks.

00:11:00.019 --> 00:11:01.983
Your medical office probably has them.

00:11:01.983 --> 00:11:02.816
If not,

00:11:02.816 --> 00:11:04.207
Down Syndrome Connection has them.

00:11:04.207 --> 00:11:06.915
We can provide them to you.

00:11:06.915 --> 00:11:09.214
So the diagnosis can happen prenatally,

00:11:09.214 --> 00:11:10.047
at birth,

00:11:10.047 --> 00:11:10.880
or in some cases,

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:12.630
several months later.

00:11:14.079 --> 00:11:16.238
Birth diagnosis can be suspected,

00:11:16.238 --> 00:11:17.703
but obviously they can't be confirmed

00:11:17.703 --> 00:11:20.370
until a karyotype has come back.

00:11:21.928 --> 00:11:23.184
Sometimes it's pretty obvious.

00:11:23.184 --> 00:11:24.769
But you can never know for sure

00:11:24.769 --> 00:11:28.402
until you see that nice chromosome array.

00:11:28.402 --> 00:11:30.211
If a family asks what
type of Down syndrome

00:11:30.211 --> 00:11:34.940
their child has before the
karyotype is concerned...

00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:37.821
You may try to dance around it.

00:11:37.821 --> 00:11:39.476
But I know that some families,

00:11:39.476 --> 00:11:40.467
like me,

00:11:40.467 --> 00:11:42.437
are really pushy and wanna know.

00:11:42.437 --> 00:11:44.630
It's probably trisomy 21.

00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:45.463
And I will tell you

00:11:45.463 --> 00:11:47.440
that most parents of
kids with Down syndrome,

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:48.273
before they know,

00:11:48.273 --> 00:11:49.106
are like,

00:11:49.106 --> 00:11:49.939
"Oh,

00:11:49.939 --> 00:11:51.038
well it might be mosaicism in mine.

00:11:51.038 --> 00:11:53.054
He doesn't really look
like he has it that much.

00:11:53.054 --> 00:11:53.887
He might be."

00:11:53.887 --> 00:11:55.236
And that's what they all hope for.

00:11:55.236 --> 00:11:58.399
Because if there's not
as many cells affected,

00:11:58.399 --> 00:12:00.370
the chances for their child to

00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:03.694
have a more typical life seem better.

00:12:03.694 --> 00:12:05.068
So...

00:12:05.068 --> 00:12:06.404
We all do hope for it.

00:12:06.404 --> 00:12:07.863
But the reality is that,

00:12:07.863 --> 00:12:08.696
in most cases,

00:12:08.696 --> 00:12:10.972
it's probably gonna be trisomy 21.

00:12:10.972 --> 00:12:12.901
And every parent is going to react

00:12:12.901 --> 00:12:13.980
to the news differently.

00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:15.738
Most of them tend to go through that

00:12:15.738 --> 00:12:17.236
typical cycle of grief,

00:12:17.236 --> 00:12:18.069
denial,

00:12:18.069 --> 00:12:18.902
bargaining,

00:12:18.902 --> 00:12:19.735
anger,

00:12:19.735 --> 00:12:20.568
acceptance.

00:12:20.568 --> 00:12:21.401
But every person is different.

00:12:21.401 --> 00:12:23.251
Every person handles this differently.

00:12:23.251 --> 00:12:25.904
And regardless of when
the diagnosis happens,

00:12:25.904 --> 00:12:28.370
the baby's birth should be celebrated.

00:12:28.370 --> 00:12:30.952
The one thing that we have
found from our members

00:12:30.952 --> 00:12:32.907
in the statewide surveys we've done,

00:12:32.907 --> 00:12:35.624
is that the hardest thing
for parents was when

00:12:35.624 --> 00:12:38.963
the people around them
acted like it was a tragedy,

00:12:38.963 --> 00:12:39.796
instead of,

00:12:39.796 --> 00:12:40.787
"You had a baby!

00:12:40.787 --> 00:12:43.008
Congratulations!"

00:12:43.008 --> 00:12:45.006
And it's a strange thing,

00:12:45.006 --> 00:12:47.658
because it's a congratulations-with-that

00:12:47.658 --> 00:12:48.947
sort of side note of,

00:12:48.947 --> 00:12:51.157
"I know this wasn't actually what you

00:12:51.157 --> 00:12:53.316
planned for when you started your family."

00:12:53.316 --> 00:12:54.436
But the bottom line is,

00:12:54.436 --> 00:12:55.679
people had a baby.

00:12:55.679 --> 00:12:58.179
They want to be congratulated.

00:13:00.348 --> 00:13:01.907
So prenatal diagnosis seems to be

00:13:01.907 --> 00:13:03.209
happening a lot more now,

00:13:03.209 --> 00:13:04.778
with those tests that are coming out.

00:13:04.778 --> 00:13:05.611
Harmony,

00:13:05.611 --> 00:13:06.945
MaterniT 21.

00:13:06.945 --> 00:13:07.778
There's a couple others,

00:13:07.778 --> 00:13:08.611
I think,

00:13:08.611 --> 00:13:09.444
verify.

00:13:09.444 --> 00:13:12.328
I'm forgetting the names of all of them.

00:13:12.328 --> 00:13:14.295
A lot of parents that we see assume

00:13:14.295 --> 00:13:16.429
that those are diagnostics that will

00:13:16.429 --> 00:13:18.008
tell them with absolute certainty,

00:13:18.008 --> 00:13:19.852
whether their child has Down syndrome.

00:13:19.852 --> 00:13:20.685
And they're not.

00:13:20.685 --> 00:13:22.610
They're screening tests.

00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:23.957
And they're pretty reliable,

00:13:23.957 --> 00:13:26.063
as a screening tool.

00:13:26.063 --> 00:13:28.529
But if a parent wants to
know absolutely for certain,

00:13:28.529 --> 00:13:31.149
they're still gonna have
to do an amniocentesis

00:13:31.149 --> 00:13:33.982
to get an absolute answer on that.

00:13:39.029 --> 00:13:40.546
So what can you do?

00:13:40.546 --> 00:13:42.434
Treat the baby's arrival as a celebration.

00:13:42.434 --> 00:13:43.582
We already talked about that.

00:13:43.582 --> 00:13:45.038
That's the biggest thing in this.

00:13:45.038 --> 00:13:45.871
A baby was born.

00:13:45.871 --> 00:13:47.038
It's exciting.

00:13:48.371 --> 00:13:49.359
And congratulate,

00:13:49.359 --> 00:13:50.692
don't apologize.

00:13:51.852 --> 00:13:52.685
Like I said,

00:13:52.685 --> 00:13:53.971
most of the parents that we've talked to

00:13:53.971 --> 00:13:56.107
have said it really hurt
their feelings to hear,

00:13:56.107 --> 00:13:56.940
"I'm sorry."

00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:57.773
They didn't wanna hear,

00:13:57.773 --> 00:13:58.606
"I'm sorry."

00:13:58.606 --> 00:13:59.457
They knew you were sorry already,

00:13:59.457 --> 00:14:02.868
they just wanted to hear congratulations.

00:14:02.868 --> 00:14:05.105
If the baby's been given a name,

00:14:05.105 --> 00:14:06.209
be sure to use the name.

00:14:06.209 --> 00:14:09.228
Because it shows that you're
looking at it as baby,

00:14:09.228 --> 00:14:10.061
as a person,

00:14:10.061 --> 00:14:11.791
instead of as a diagnosis and

00:14:11.791 --> 00:14:14.374
that's so important to parents.

00:14:16.668 --> 00:14:17.501
Other thing you can do is

00:14:17.501 --> 00:14:19.294
use people first language.

00:14:19.294 --> 00:14:20.633
I find this one kind of fascinating.

00:14:20.633 --> 00:14:24.128
Because having one son in
the Down syndrome community,

00:14:24.128 --> 00:14:25.800
and one son in the autism community,

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:27.809
the autism community seems to be moving

00:14:27.809 --> 00:14:31.739
a bit more towards using
the diagnosis first.

00:14:31.739 --> 00:14:32.905
"I have an autistic child,"

00:14:32.905 --> 00:14:33.738
as opposed to,

00:14:33.738 --> 00:14:36.681
"I have a child with autism."

00:14:36.681 --> 00:14:38.582
I believe they call it identity first,

00:14:38.582 --> 00:14:40.267
if I remember right.

00:14:40.267 --> 00:14:42.981
But the Down syndrome
community prefers people first.

00:14:42.981 --> 00:14:45.111
"I have a baby with Down syndrome."

00:14:45.111 --> 00:14:45.944
Not,

00:14:45.944 --> 00:14:48.444
"I have a Down syndrome baby."

00:14:49.287 --> 00:14:50.527
Tell both parents together.

00:14:50.527 --> 00:14:52.337
You would think this one is a no-brainer,

00:14:52.337 --> 00:14:54.553
but I cannot tell you
how many of our families

00:14:54.553 --> 00:14:56.987
said that they were not told together,

00:14:56.987 --> 00:14:58.870
the mother and father.

00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:00.130
And I actually wasn't.

00:15:00.130 --> 00:15:01.333
My husband was across the room

00:15:01.333 --> 00:15:02.166
and I had to say,

00:15:02.166 --> 00:15:03.111
"Could you go get him,

00:15:03.111 --> 00:15:03.944
please?"

00:15:03.944 --> 00:15:06.565
Because I was completely overwhelmed.

00:15:06.565 --> 00:15:08.061
So definitely tell them together,

00:15:08.061 --> 00:15:09.726
if there's any way possible.

00:15:09.726 --> 00:15:11.696
And remember that mothers and fathers

00:15:11.696 --> 00:15:14.311
are probably gonna respond
differently to the news.

00:15:14.311 --> 00:15:15.715
Every person is different.

00:15:15.715 --> 00:15:17.441
But I think we all know that men and women

00:15:17.441 --> 00:15:19.886
sometimes tend to process
things a little bit differently.

00:15:19.886 --> 00:15:20.869
So you're probably gonna get

00:15:20.869 --> 00:15:23.952
different responses from each parent.

00:15:25.777 --> 00:15:28.529
Answer questions honestly
and knowledgeably.

00:15:28.529 --> 00:15:31.149
So you probably know a lot of the answers

00:15:31.149 --> 00:15:32.549
to things about Down syndrome,

00:15:32.549 --> 00:15:33.938
because it's so common.

00:15:33.938 --> 00:15:35.616
There's a lot of information out there.

00:15:35.616 --> 00:15:36.449
But if you don't,

00:15:36.449 --> 00:15:38.058
call us and we will help you.

00:15:38.058 --> 00:15:39.170
We will get you the answer.

00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:40.470
Because we have it if you don't.

00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:41.720
I guarantee it.

00:15:42.603 --> 00:15:44.790
Allow parents time to
bond with their child.

00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:47.415
But check in regularly to
see if they need anything.

00:15:47.415 --> 00:15:50.137
We had a lot of parents tell us that they

00:15:50.137 --> 00:15:51.672
were pretty much ignored in the hospital

00:15:51.672 --> 00:15:54.246
after they had their
child with a disability.

00:15:54.246 --> 00:15:56.325
Nobody wanted to go anywhere near them,

00:15:56.325 --> 00:15:59.325
and it was super isolating for them.

00:16:00.664 --> 00:16:01.945
And recognize that certain statements

00:16:01.945 --> 00:16:03.705
may seem judgemental.

00:16:03.705 --> 00:16:05.544
So the one we hear all the time,

00:16:05.544 --> 00:16:06.843
is people hate being asked,

00:16:06.843 --> 00:16:08.642
"Did you have prenatal testing?"

00:16:08.642 --> 00:16:10.354
Because they feel that there's this

00:16:10.354 --> 00:16:11.482
unspoken assumption of,

00:16:11.482 --> 00:16:12.315
"Well if you did,

00:16:12.315 --> 00:16:14.321
you would've maybe made
a different choice."

00:16:14.321 --> 00:16:15.706
That may not be true.

00:16:15.706 --> 00:16:19.301
You may say that with no
underlying meaning at all.

00:16:19.301 --> 00:16:20.985
But that's how parents perceive it.

00:16:20.985 --> 00:16:25.036
So that question is a best one to avoid,

00:16:25.036 --> 00:16:26.036
if possible.

00:16:27.457 --> 00:16:30.326
And be aware of the medical issues.

00:16:30.326 --> 00:16:32.584
But you can also emphasize that in many,

00:16:32.584 --> 00:16:33.417
many,

00:16:33.417 --> 00:16:34.344
many of these cases,

00:16:34.344 --> 00:16:35.975
the conditions are very treatable.

00:16:35.975 --> 00:16:36.808
So for example,

00:16:36.808 --> 00:16:38.575
the heart defects that I talked about.

00:16:38.575 --> 00:16:41.248
Treatable in so many cases.

00:16:41.248 --> 00:16:42.081
Not all cases.

00:16:42.081 --> 00:16:44.882
We still see kids die
every year from them.

00:16:44.882 --> 00:16:45.907
But they're much,

00:16:45.907 --> 00:16:48.524
much more treatable than they used to be.

00:16:48.524 --> 00:16:49.762
And the same with leukemia.

00:16:49.762 --> 00:16:50.750
It is terrifying.

00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:53.226
A terrifying diagnosis for any parent.

00:16:53.226 --> 00:16:54.696
But there have been some studies

00:16:54.696 --> 00:16:56.530
that have shown that children with

00:16:56.530 --> 00:16:58.339
Down syndrome actually respond better

00:16:58.339 --> 00:17:00.125
to the chemotherapy and treatment

00:17:00.125 --> 00:17:02.088
for leukemia than typical children.

00:17:02.088 --> 00:17:03.832
So that's a positive for parents to

00:17:03.832 --> 00:17:07.111
hold onto if they are facing that.

00:17:07.111 --> 00:17:08.776
And trust parent intuition.

00:17:08.776 --> 00:17:10.841
A lot of our parents say that when they

00:17:10.841 --> 00:17:13.440
bring up a concern with their
child with Down syndrome,

00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:14.273
they're told,

00:17:14.273 --> 00:17:15.230
"That's just Down syndrome."

00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:17.115
And sometimes it is just Down syndrome.

00:17:17.115 --> 00:17:20.074
But sometimes it's not Down syndrome.

00:17:20.074 --> 00:17:21.282
I know from personal experience,

00:17:21.282 --> 00:17:22.613
my son's thyroid.

00:17:22.613 --> 00:17:23.446
I kept saying,

00:17:23.446 --> 00:17:24.907
"He's got all these symptoms.

00:17:24.907 --> 00:17:26.593
He's all orange."

00:17:26.593 --> 00:17:27.426
And he said,

00:17:27.426 --> 00:17:28.340
"Well he eats carrots. "

00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:29.173
And I'm like,

00:17:29.173 --> 00:17:31.220
"He doesn't really eat carrots."

00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:32.053
And I said,

00:17:32.053 --> 00:17:32.946
"You know he's kind of lethargic."

00:17:32.946 --> 00:17:34.070
"Well that's just Down syndrome."

00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:34.903
I'm like,

00:17:34.903 --> 00:17:35.736
"Okay.

00:17:35.736 --> 00:17:36.569
I don't know."

00:17:36.569 --> 00:17:37.402
So push and push and push.

00:17:37.402 --> 00:17:38.574
It turns out he did have hypothyroidism.

00:17:38.574 --> 00:17:39.557
And once we treated it,

00:17:39.557 --> 00:17:40.390
he's a lovely,

00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:42.890
normal shade of skin tone now.

00:17:44.661 --> 00:17:45.736
And a different child.

00:17:45.736 --> 00:17:48.256
So it may just be Down syndrome.

00:17:48.256 --> 00:17:50.193
It may be an overreacting parent.

00:17:50.193 --> 00:17:51.256
But it might not be.

00:17:51.256 --> 00:17:52.876
So trust parents' intuition.

00:17:52.876 --> 00:17:55.459
At least give it a second look.

00:17:57.368 --> 00:17:58.650
What else can you do?

00:17:58.650 --> 00:18:01.521
Provide referrals to us
and to the Regional Center.

00:18:01.521 --> 00:18:03.481
So I made contact with pretty much every

00:18:03.481 --> 00:18:04.968
social services department in

00:18:04.968 --> 00:18:06.484
the birthing hospitals here.

00:18:06.484 --> 00:18:08.423
And they should have our information.

00:18:08.423 --> 00:18:09.256
If not,

00:18:09.256 --> 00:18:10.089
we're easy to find.

00:18:10.089 --> 00:18:10.946
We have a website.

00:18:10.946 --> 00:18:13.946
We have an office in the East Bay...

00:18:18.381 --> 00:18:19.879
That's open eight to five.

00:18:19.879 --> 00:18:21.738
Monday through Friday.

00:18:21.738 --> 00:18:22.660
But if you email,

00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:24.109
there's usually people answering email

00:18:24.109 --> 00:18:26.351
at various other times as well.

00:18:26.351 --> 00:18:28.031
So we are very reachable.

00:18:28.031 --> 00:18:29.787
We will also deliver a welcome basket

00:18:29.787 --> 00:18:32.733
with gifts for the family
and more information

00:18:32.733 --> 00:18:34.165
about the services we provide.

00:18:34.165 --> 00:18:36.594
The welcome packets we
have at your hospitals

00:18:36.594 --> 00:18:38.959
are pretty basic because
a lot of the families

00:18:38.959 --> 00:18:41.543
do not want to be overwhelmed right away.

00:18:41.543 --> 00:18:42.870
And we totally understand that.

00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:46.055
So they have a very short
informational piece.

00:18:46.055 --> 00:18:48.093
A little brochure about our organization

00:18:48.093 --> 00:18:51.895
and a card for our new Parent Coordinator

00:18:51.895 --> 00:18:54.469
who will meet with them and talk to them.

00:18:54.469 --> 00:18:56.590
If they want a welcome basket,

00:18:56.590 --> 00:18:58.531
it comes with a handmade quilt,

00:18:58.531 --> 00:18:59.598
and some baby toys,

00:18:59.598 --> 00:19:00.519
and some clothes,

00:19:00.519 --> 00:19:01.767
and all kinds of fun things.

00:19:01.767 --> 00:19:03.806
And more information about Down syndrome,

00:19:03.806 --> 00:19:05.967
for when they're ready.

00:19:05.967 --> 00:19:08.791
We can also provide a
parent-to-parent match.

00:19:08.791 --> 00:19:10.235
We try to match people up

00:19:10.235 --> 00:19:12.695
that have similar backgrounds.

00:19:12.695 --> 00:19:13.565
For example,

00:19:13.565 --> 00:19:15.240
if somebody has a baby
with a heart condition,

00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:17.843
we will match them with
a parent whose child

00:19:17.843 --> 00:19:20.470
has been through a
successful heart repair.

00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:23.720
So you can answer questions about that.

00:19:26.001 --> 00:19:27.351
That's my little guy.

00:19:27.351 --> 00:19:29.106
(laughter)

00:19:29.106 --> 00:19:30.152
Isn't he cute?

00:19:30.152 --> 00:19:31.819
I'm a little biased.

00:19:34.422 --> 00:19:35.782
So what is early intervention?

00:19:35.782 --> 00:19:37.722
You probably hear that term a lot.

00:19:37.722 --> 00:19:39.414
A lot of people probably know what it is.

00:19:39.414 --> 00:19:40.822
Some of you work in it already.

00:19:40.822 --> 00:19:42.519
So I'll give you the brief view.

00:19:42.519 --> 00:19:44.055
Children with Down syndrome are entitled

00:19:44.055 --> 00:19:46.134
to receive early intervention services

00:19:46.134 --> 00:19:47.551
through the Regional Center.

00:19:47.551 --> 00:19:48.541
At least here in the Bay area.

00:19:48.541 --> 00:19:49.423
I don't know if it differs in

00:19:49.423 --> 00:19:51.870
other parts of the state and other states.

00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:53.626
But here in the Bay Area.

00:19:53.626 --> 00:19:55.403
And that includes infant development,

00:19:55.403 --> 00:19:56.761
occupational therapy,

00:19:56.761 --> 00:19:57.660
physical therapy,

00:19:57.660 --> 00:19:59.243
and speech therapy.

00:20:01.072 --> 00:20:03.506
We work in conjunction
with the Regional Center.

00:20:03.506 --> 00:20:05.157
So we don't provide those therapies,

00:20:05.157 --> 00:20:07.321
but we pick up where they leave off.

00:20:07.321 --> 00:20:08.908
We have support groups.

00:20:08.908 --> 00:20:10.911
We have development classes

00:20:10.911 --> 00:20:12.784
that are not specifically OT,

00:20:12.784 --> 00:20:15.067
but that continue to work on skills,

00:20:15.067 --> 00:20:16.165
like speech skills,

00:20:16.165 --> 00:20:18.934
occupational therapy skills,

00:20:18.934 --> 00:20:20.396
gross motor skills.

00:20:20.396 --> 00:20:22.038
So the actual early intervention

00:20:22.038 --> 00:20:24.118
is gonna come through the Regional Center,

00:20:24.118 --> 00:20:25.893
but then we pick up where they leave off

00:20:25.893 --> 00:20:30.156
and provide more
opportunities for development.

00:20:30.156 --> 00:20:31.537
The Department of Developmental Services

00:20:31.537 --> 00:20:34.030
has a full list of area Regional Centers

00:20:34.030 --> 00:20:35.478
on their website.

00:20:35.478 --> 00:20:36.311
Sure,

00:20:36.311 --> 00:20:37.144
if you're in the hospitals

00:20:37.144 --> 00:20:38.176
or the medical facilities,

00:20:38.176 --> 00:20:39.042
you have them as well.

00:20:39.042 --> 00:20:39.997
If you do not,

00:20:39.997 --> 00:20:40.988
for whatever reason,

00:20:40.988 --> 00:20:41.907
we have them.

00:20:41.907 --> 00:20:44.500
So you can contact us.

00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:46.009
So quality of life.

00:20:46.009 --> 00:20:47.807
Worries about a person
with Down syndrome's

00:20:47.807 --> 00:20:50.437
quality of life are generally unfounded,

00:20:50.437 --> 00:20:52.325
as are concerns that the person will be

00:20:52.325 --> 00:20:53.878
a burden to their family.

00:20:53.878 --> 00:20:55.765
So this is a big concern parents have.

00:20:55.765 --> 00:20:57.677
How is this going to affect our family?

00:20:57.677 --> 00:21:00.304
How is this going to affect
the child's siblings?

00:21:00.304 --> 00:21:02.248
What is this gonna do to our dynamic?

00:21:02.248 --> 00:21:03.754
I know when I had my son,

00:21:03.754 --> 00:21:05.731
I really didn't know much of anything

00:21:05.731 --> 00:21:07.024
about Down syndrome at all.

00:21:07.024 --> 00:21:08.077
And my first thought was,

00:21:08.077 --> 00:21:10.136
"Am I still gonna be able to travel?"

00:21:10.136 --> 00:21:12.079
Because my family really likes to travel.

00:21:12.079 --> 00:21:13.252
"Am I gonna be housebound now?"

00:21:13.252 --> 00:21:14.085
Which,

00:21:14.085 --> 00:21:14.918
now that he's five,

00:21:14.918 --> 00:21:16.606
I recognize that's ridiculous.

00:21:16.606 --> 00:21:17.789
But at the time,

00:21:17.789 --> 00:21:18.622
as a new parent,

00:21:18.622 --> 00:21:21.169
I was totally confused.

00:21:21.169 --> 00:21:23.429
So there has been a large-scale study done

00:21:23.429 --> 00:21:26.760
by Brian Skotko among
other people out of Boston.

00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:28.358
I'm sure a lot of you probably

00:21:28.358 --> 00:21:31.450
are familiar with his research.

00:21:31.450 --> 00:21:33.352
I believe it was over 2,000 individuals

00:21:33.352 --> 00:21:35.229
with Down syndrome he talked to.

00:21:35.229 --> 00:21:37.688
And 99% of people with Down syndrome

00:21:37.688 --> 00:21:39.738
indicated that they're
happy with their lives.

00:21:39.738 --> 00:21:42.442
And 97% like who they are.

00:21:42.442 --> 00:21:43.888
Is that not amazing?

00:21:43.888 --> 00:21:45.603
Do you think 99% of us in this room

00:21:45.603 --> 00:21:47.648
are actually content?

00:21:47.648 --> 00:21:50.391
I think it's pretty awesome.

00:21:50.391 --> 00:21:53.128
86% indicated that they
make friends easily,

00:21:53.128 --> 00:21:55.769
and those who struggled tended to live in

00:21:55.769 --> 00:21:57.693
isolated situations where they didn't

00:21:57.693 --> 00:22:01.026
have much opportunity for socialization.

00:22:03.065 --> 00:22:05.415
The average lifespan for a
person with Down syndrome

00:22:05.415 --> 00:22:07.738
is now about 60 to 65 years.

00:22:07.738 --> 00:22:09.216
That is a big change.

00:22:09.216 --> 00:22:11.358
When I had my son five years ago,

00:22:11.358 --> 00:22:12.943
I had a nurse come in and say,

00:22:12.943 --> 00:22:13.776
"Oh,

00:22:13.776 --> 00:22:14.609
honey,

00:22:14.609 --> 00:22:15.442
don't worry.

00:22:15.442 --> 00:22:16.826
They can live to be 25 now."

00:22:16.826 --> 00:22:18.907
And I burst into tears because I was like,

00:22:18.907 --> 00:22:21.062
"You mean I'm gonna outlive my child?"

00:22:21.062 --> 00:22:23.162
It was terrible.

00:22:23.162 --> 00:22:24.473
She had old information.

00:22:24.473 --> 00:22:26.179
A lot of people have old information.

00:22:26.179 --> 00:22:28.474
Particularly the advances in heart surgery

00:22:28.474 --> 00:22:30.645
have made that lifespan go way,

00:22:30.645 --> 00:22:31.478
way up.

00:22:33.285 --> 00:22:36.735
Every person with Down
syndrome has unique abilities.

00:22:36.735 --> 00:22:38.239
It's really just like any of us in here.

00:22:38.239 --> 00:22:39.224
We all have unique abilities,

00:22:39.224 --> 00:22:40.057
right?

00:22:40.057 --> 00:22:41.742
I'm terrible at math
but I'm good with words.

00:22:41.742 --> 00:22:43.684
Same thing with people with Down syndrome.

00:22:43.684 --> 00:22:44.888
They're all gonna have their strengths.

00:22:44.888 --> 00:22:47.585
They're all gonna have their weaknesses.

00:22:47.585 --> 00:22:48.926
And more and more children
with Down syndrome

00:22:48.926 --> 00:22:51.433
are becoming fully included in school,

00:22:51.433 --> 00:22:53.221
which enhances their success.

00:22:53.221 --> 00:22:55.302
They have done a lot of studies that show

00:22:55.302 --> 00:22:57.997
children with intellectual disabilities

00:22:57.997 --> 00:22:59.318
such as Down syndrome,

00:22:59.318 --> 00:23:02.806
that are included in a
typical classroom environment

00:23:02.806 --> 00:23:04.223
with appropriate support,

00:23:04.223 --> 00:23:05.979
actually at the end of their schooling,

00:23:05.979 --> 00:23:08.057
end up a couple years ahead of students

00:23:08.057 --> 00:23:11.733
who are educated in segregated classrooms.

00:23:11.733 --> 00:23:13.342
So that's a really positive change.

00:23:13.342 --> 00:23:14.175
And right now,

00:23:14.175 --> 00:23:17.528
the law supports that for kids.

00:23:17.528 --> 00:23:18.361
And in California,

00:23:18.361 --> 00:23:19.644
you sometimes have to fight for it.

00:23:19.644 --> 00:23:20.890
But the law is on your side.

00:23:20.890 --> 00:23:22.333
The federal law is on your side.

00:23:22.333 --> 00:23:23.841
So it can be done.

00:23:23.841 --> 00:23:27.089
So if parents are concerned about that,

00:23:27.089 --> 00:23:28.714
the law is on their side.

00:23:28.714 --> 00:23:30.513
They need to know where
to go for resources.

00:23:30.513 --> 00:23:31.872
They may need to push for it.

00:23:31.872 --> 00:23:33.535
But the law is on their side.

00:23:33.535 --> 00:23:35.039
And some of us say there's
never been a better

00:23:35.039 --> 00:23:37.885
time to have a child with Down syndrome

00:23:37.885 --> 00:23:39.886
because there's so much support now

00:23:39.886 --> 00:23:41.517
that was not available before.

00:23:41.517 --> 00:23:42.350
The early intervention.

00:23:42.350 --> 00:23:44.480
The supports in schooling.

00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:47.032
The advances in medicine.

00:23:47.032 --> 00:23:48.862
So it really is a good time to have one

00:23:48.862 --> 00:23:49.805
as opposed to 20,

00:23:49.805 --> 00:23:50.888
30 years ago.

00:23:52.264 --> 00:23:53.639
Adults with Down syndrome can have

00:23:53.639 --> 00:23:55.578
relationships and marry.

00:23:55.578 --> 00:23:57.402
They can attend post-secondary schools.

00:23:57.402 --> 00:23:58.928
There's been a big movement there.

00:23:58.928 --> 00:24:00.930
There's actually a lot of
post-secondary schools,

00:24:00.930 --> 00:24:01.763
even in California,

00:24:01.763 --> 00:24:02.969
that have programs for adults

00:24:02.969 --> 00:24:04.596
with intellectual disabilities.

00:24:04.596 --> 00:24:07.297
There's one down in Fresno
that we hear a lot about,

00:24:07.297 --> 00:24:09.668
because it's pretty close to us.

00:24:09.668 --> 00:24:12.184
They can live semi-independently
or independently.

00:24:12.184 --> 00:24:13.913
They can work at rewarding jobs.

00:24:13.913 --> 00:24:17.233
They can actively participate
in their community.

00:24:17.233 --> 00:24:19.416
And each person with
Down syndrome is unique.

00:24:19.416 --> 00:24:20.798
So there's no way,

00:24:20.798 --> 00:24:22.635
particularly if you have a brand-new

00:24:22.635 --> 00:24:23.792
baby in your hospital,

00:24:23.792 --> 00:24:25.687
that anyone can say what that child

00:24:25.687 --> 00:24:28.354
is going to grow up to be or do.

00:24:30.309 --> 00:24:31.289
Common myths.

00:24:31.289 --> 00:24:33.565
Only women older than age 35 are likely

00:24:33.565 --> 00:24:35.435
to have a baby with Down syndrome.

00:24:35.435 --> 00:24:36.891
Not true!

00:24:36.891 --> 00:24:38.320
80% of babies with Down syndrome

00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:40.558
are born to women under the age of 35.

00:24:40.558 --> 00:24:42.173
And the reason why is because

00:24:42.173 --> 00:24:45.266
more women under the
age of 35 have babies.

00:24:45.266 --> 00:24:47.509
So more babies being born equals

00:24:47.509 --> 00:24:50.790
more babies being born with Down syndrome.

00:24:50.790 --> 00:24:52.038
A child with Down syndrome will have a

00:24:52.038 --> 00:24:54.613
negative effect on his or her parents.

00:24:54.613 --> 00:24:58.406
That same Dr. Skotko study showed that 99%

00:24:58.406 --> 00:25:00.456
of parents in that study
report loving their

00:25:00.456 --> 00:25:02.736
child with Down syndrome
and the divorce rate

00:25:02.736 --> 00:25:04.793
in families who have a
child with Down syndrome

00:25:04.793 --> 00:25:06.908
is actually lower than in families with a

00:25:06.908 --> 00:25:08.294
non-disabled child.

00:25:08.294 --> 00:25:09.127
Which is very cool,

00:25:09.127 --> 00:25:13.980
for those of us who have
children with Down syndrome.

00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:16.135
A child with Down syndrome will have a

00:25:16.135 --> 00:25:18.330
negative effect on his or her siblings.

00:25:18.330 --> 00:25:19.163
Also false.

00:25:19.163 --> 00:25:21.961
97% of siblings of
people with Down syndrome

00:25:21.961 --> 00:25:23.693
reported being proud of their sibling,

00:25:23.693 --> 00:25:26.262
and 88% think that they
are a better person

00:25:26.262 --> 00:25:28.066
for having a sibling with Down syndrome.

00:25:28.066 --> 00:25:28.899
I will say,

00:25:28.899 --> 00:25:30.293
my two sons are four years apart.

00:25:30.293 --> 00:25:32.606
And the bond between them is incredible.

00:25:32.606 --> 00:25:35.141
My younger one is the
one with Down syndrome.

00:25:35.141 --> 00:25:37.264
And my older son is his biggest protector,

00:25:37.264 --> 00:25:38.776
his biggest fan.

00:25:38.776 --> 00:25:41.069
He loves everything about him.

00:25:41.069 --> 00:25:43.052
I don't think he really
sees the Down syndrome.

00:25:43.052 --> 00:25:44.296
He knows that Sam has it,

00:25:44.296 --> 00:25:47.157
and he knows that it impacts
the way he learns things.

00:25:47.157 --> 00:25:48.818
But it doesn't matter to him.

00:25:48.818 --> 00:25:50.298
It's just his brother.

00:25:50.298 --> 00:25:52.377
And it's a wonderful relationship

00:25:52.377 --> 00:25:55.960
and we see that in so
many of our families.

00:25:57.550 --> 00:25:59.326
People with Down syndrome
are always happy.

00:25:59.326 --> 00:26:00.741
So I had to put in this picture of my son,

00:26:00.741 --> 00:26:02.761
who does not like to wear hats.

00:26:02.761 --> 00:26:03.966
(laughter)

00:26:03.966 --> 00:26:06.603
And my husband had just put
his little pumpkin hat on

00:26:06.603 --> 00:26:08.796
and he was really not happy.

00:26:08.796 --> 00:26:10.803
He makes that same face if you tell him

00:26:10.803 --> 00:26:12.913
there's no bacon in the morning.

00:26:12.913 --> 00:26:15.792
(laughter)

00:26:15.792 --> 00:26:17.742
So they experience the
same range of emotions

00:26:17.742 --> 00:26:19.182
as anybody else.

00:26:19.182 --> 00:26:20.015
Anecdotally,

00:26:20.015 --> 00:26:22.533
they do tend to be pretty positive,

00:26:22.533 --> 00:26:24.491
go-with-the-flow people.

00:26:24.491 --> 00:26:25.324
Of my two kids,

00:26:25.324 --> 00:26:27.278
the one with Down syndrome is definitely

00:26:27.278 --> 00:26:29.138
the more happy-go-lucky.

00:26:29.138 --> 00:26:30.207
But he has his moments,

00:26:30.207 --> 00:26:32.183
as you can see.

00:26:32.183 --> 00:26:34.978
God only gives special
children to special people.

00:26:34.978 --> 00:26:36.161
So this one,

00:26:36.161 --> 00:26:36.994
I think,

00:26:36.994 --> 00:26:39.030
everybody who says this means well,

00:26:39.030 --> 00:26:40.940
but we found that our parents

00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:42.907
really don't like hearing it.

00:26:42.907 --> 00:26:44.758
Because they feel like
they're just ordinary

00:26:44.758 --> 00:26:45.591
people who just,

00:26:45.591 --> 00:26:47.863
this is how there life is.

00:26:47.863 --> 00:26:48.696
And it's fine.

00:26:48.696 --> 00:26:49.535
And they're happy with it.

00:26:49.535 --> 00:26:51.144
But they didn't do anything special,

00:26:51.144 --> 00:26:53.394
that this happened to them.

00:26:55.386 --> 00:26:56.287
So what we do.

00:26:56.287 --> 00:26:57.891
We have one-on-one parents mentors,

00:26:57.891 --> 00:26:58.724
for new families,

00:26:58.724 --> 00:27:00.256
which I talked about.

00:27:00.256 --> 00:27:01.483
We have support groups for parents,

00:27:01.483 --> 00:27:02.316
grandparents,

00:27:02.316 --> 00:27:04.355
and other family members.

00:27:04.355 --> 00:27:05.963
We have developmental-based classes

00:27:05.963 --> 00:27:07.534
for infants through adults.

00:27:07.534 --> 00:27:08.784
So at the infant stage,

00:27:08.784 --> 00:27:10.363
this really looks like a lot of play,

00:27:10.363 --> 00:27:11.951
with the parents talking and we bring

00:27:11.951 --> 00:27:14.509
in speakers on different topics.

00:27:14.509 --> 00:27:15.342
As they get older,

00:27:15.342 --> 00:27:17.473
my son's in the age four to seven class,

00:27:17.473 --> 00:27:18.894
and they do art projects.

00:27:18.894 --> 00:27:20.894
And they do gross motor activities.

00:27:20.894 --> 00:27:21.727
And they dance,

00:27:21.727 --> 00:27:23.076
and they do circle time.

00:27:23.076 --> 00:27:24.341
And they do calendar.

00:27:24.341 --> 00:27:27.935
And it kind of is a
school-readiness type of thing.

00:27:27.935 --> 00:27:28.839
And then for our adults,

00:27:28.839 --> 00:27:30.702
they do a lot of fun activities.

00:27:30.702 --> 00:27:32.891
But then they also do practical skills,

00:27:32.891 --> 00:27:34.196
like going out in the community,

00:27:34.196 --> 00:27:36.102
and going to the grocery store,

00:27:36.102 --> 00:27:38.019
and that type of thing.

00:27:39.123 --> 00:27:41.258
We have a school-readiness summer program.

00:27:41.258 --> 00:27:42.691
That program is amazing.

00:27:42.691 --> 00:27:45.539
My son participated last year
and will again this year.

00:27:45.539 --> 00:27:48.800
The speech gains are incredible.

00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:49.633
And I mean,

00:27:49.633 --> 00:27:51.297
not just verbal speech,

00:27:51.297 --> 00:27:53.981
but assistive AAC device,

00:27:53.981 --> 00:27:54.823
communication,

00:27:54.823 --> 00:27:55.732
sign-language.

00:27:55.732 --> 00:27:57.483
They work on wherever the child

00:27:57.483 --> 00:27:59.630
has the strengths in communication.

00:27:59.630 --> 00:28:02.513
That's what they work on
in a school-type setting.

00:28:02.513 --> 00:28:04.413
And then they work with the child's

00:28:04.413 --> 00:28:06.697
educational team at their actual school,

00:28:06.697 --> 00:28:09.079
so that those skills can carry over.

00:28:09.079 --> 00:28:10.158
We actually just won an award

00:28:10.158 --> 00:28:11.862
for that program last week.

00:28:11.862 --> 00:28:12.865
It was very exciting.

00:28:12.865 --> 00:28:14.644
So very cool.

00:28:14.644 --> 00:28:16.062
We have an on-site reading teacher.

00:28:16.062 --> 00:28:18.596
We have music therapy
for infants and children.

00:28:18.596 --> 00:28:19.850
We offer that in the East Bay,

00:28:19.850 --> 00:28:20.683
the South Bay,

00:28:20.683 --> 00:28:22.516
and the peninsula now.

00:28:23.509 --> 00:28:26.488
We have an on-site feeding
and oral-placement therapist.

00:28:26.488 --> 00:28:27.977
We have special events
throughout the year,

00:28:27.977 --> 00:28:28.849
such as seminars,

00:28:28.849 --> 00:28:29.724
training sessions,

00:28:29.724 --> 00:28:30.664
camps.

00:28:30.664 --> 00:28:32.527
Our Medical Outreach Alliance.

00:28:32.527 --> 00:28:33.360
That's what I do,

00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:34.952
partnering with the area hospitals

00:28:34.952 --> 00:28:37.425
to make sure they have
the information they need.

00:28:37.425 --> 00:28:39.417
Our Education Alliance is similar,

00:28:39.417 --> 00:28:41.399
partnering with the school districts

00:28:41.399 --> 00:28:44.173
to ensure that we can support
our kids in the schools,

00:28:44.173 --> 00:28:46.394
and help the teachers understand how

00:28:46.394 --> 00:28:48.407
people with Down syndrome tend to learn

00:28:48.407 --> 00:28:52.369
and be successful in a school environment.

00:28:52.369 --> 00:28:54.009
So what we don't do.

00:28:54.009 --> 00:28:55.568
We don't provide early intervention.

00:28:55.568 --> 00:28:57.087
That's through the Regional Center.

00:28:57.087 --> 00:28:58.087
We can definitely connect people

00:28:58.087 --> 00:28:59.405
with the Regional Center though.

00:28:59.405 --> 00:29:01.276
We also don't turn anyone away.

00:29:01.276 --> 00:29:03.716
Our services are inclusive for anyone.

00:29:03.716 --> 00:29:05.655
Family members are always welcome.

00:29:05.655 --> 00:29:08.168
My older son participates
in events all the time,

00:29:08.168 --> 00:29:11.071
just by virtue of being Sam's brother.

00:29:11.071 --> 00:29:11.971
And many,

00:29:11.971 --> 00:29:12.804
many,

00:29:12.804 --> 00:29:13.868
many of our programs are free.

00:29:13.868 --> 00:29:16.469
We are grant-funded and donation-funded.

00:29:16.469 --> 00:29:19.275
We have a few programs
that have cost attached,

00:29:19.275 --> 00:29:20.548
like that summer program.

00:29:20.548 --> 00:29:21.381
But when they do,

00:29:21.381 --> 00:29:23.175
there's always scholarships available.

00:29:23.175 --> 00:29:25.951
So a family shouldn't feel as if they

00:29:25.951 --> 00:29:28.289
shouldn't reach out because
of financial concerns,

00:29:28.289 --> 00:29:30.208
because we never turn anyone away.

00:29:30.208 --> 00:29:33.535
And there is no membership fee.

00:29:33.535 --> 00:29:34.940
Other resources.

00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:36.645
Global Down Syndrome Foundation

00:29:36.645 --> 00:29:38.923
and LuMind Foundation
are both doing a lot of

00:29:38.923 --> 00:29:41.048
research-type work in different areas

00:29:41.048 --> 00:29:42.334
in Down Syndrome.

00:29:42.334 --> 00:29:44.414
National Down Syndrome Congress has a

00:29:44.414 --> 00:29:46.152
wonderful conference every year.

00:29:46.152 --> 00:29:47.366
It's gonna be in Sacramento this year.

00:29:47.366 --> 00:29:48.546
I'm very excited.

00:29:48.546 --> 00:29:50.602
National Down Syndrome Society.

00:29:50.602 --> 00:29:53.016
They do a lot of advocacy
work on behalf of

00:29:53.016 --> 00:29:54.412
people with Down syndrome and

00:29:54.412 --> 00:29:56.453
similar intellectual disabilities.

00:29:56.453 --> 00:29:58.225
Down Syndrome Diagnosis Network.

00:29:58.225 --> 00:30:00.536
I'm actually on the board of that one.

00:30:00.536 --> 00:30:03.256
They are a reasonably new organization,

00:30:03.256 --> 00:30:04.867
about three years old.

00:30:04.867 --> 00:30:09.034
And they provide online
parent support through groups.

00:30:09.878 --> 00:30:11.068
They're a really nice compliment

00:30:11.068 --> 00:30:13.745
to organizations like
Down Syndrome Connection,

00:30:13.745 --> 00:30:17.899
because 24-seven there
is always someone online.

00:30:17.899 --> 00:30:19.194
If your kid has that rash

00:30:19.194 --> 00:30:20.362
that you're worried about,

00:30:20.362 --> 00:30:22.162
you send a picture to your group

00:30:22.162 --> 00:30:23.417
and somebody's gonna answer you,

00:30:23.417 --> 00:30:24.706
and answer your questions,

00:30:24.706 --> 00:30:26.956
and talk you off the ledge.

00:30:28.003 --> 00:30:29.415
Local family resource networks.

00:30:29.415 --> 00:30:33.546
They differ depending where
you are in the Bay Area.

00:30:33.546 --> 00:30:34.744
But they're all over.

00:30:34.744 --> 00:30:35.749
Center for Down Syndrome at

00:30:35.749 --> 00:30:37.625
Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

00:30:37.625 --> 00:30:39.679
I'm sure some of you
probably even work there.

00:30:39.679 --> 00:30:41.987
We get a lot of families from there.

00:30:41.987 --> 00:30:44.162
Charlie's Clinic at UCSF Benioff

00:30:44.162 --> 00:30:46.791
Children's Hospital in Oakland.

00:30:46.791 --> 00:30:48.555
I know we have someone here from there.

00:30:48.555 --> 00:30:49.709
(laughter)

00:30:49.709 --> 00:30:54.037
And then the Regional Center
for early intervention.

00:30:54.037 --> 00:30:55.874
And that's just my references.

00:30:55.874 --> 00:30:58.217
And before I wrap up in 17 seconds,

00:30:58.217 --> 00:31:00.361
I just wanna thank everybody here.

00:31:00.361 --> 00:31:01.194
I will tell you,

00:31:01.194 --> 00:31:02.027
as a parent,

00:31:02.027 --> 00:31:04.535
it means so much to have people

00:31:04.535 --> 00:31:06.535
that actually care about

00:31:07.518 --> 00:31:08.795
kids in the disability community,

00:31:08.795 --> 00:31:10.711
adults in the disability community,

00:31:10.711 --> 00:31:12.103
and are taking the time to learn

00:31:12.103 --> 00:31:15.068
how to make them a part
of the bigger community.

00:31:15.068 --> 00:31:17.566
So I really appreciate you all.

00:31:17.566 --> 00:31:20.566
(audience applauds)
