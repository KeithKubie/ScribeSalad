00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:03.610
We’re always staring up into space, trying
to figure out what we’re seeing.

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:07.590
We like to think we know what’s going on,
but what if we’ve been seeing it wrong this

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:08.590
WHOLE TIME.

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:10.300
Ok, a little context here.

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:15.630
Almost all normal galaxies have a supermassive
black hole at the center, including ours.

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.610
(That’s not freaky at all.)

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:22.400
BUT we can’t actually see the black holes
themselves--they’re so dense and their gravitational

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.880
field is so strong that nothing can escape
them, not even light.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.890
So we observe them instead by seeing how the
matter around them behaves.

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.859
All of the ‘stuff’ in these galaxies is
verrrrry slowly falling in toward the black

00:00:33.859 --> 00:00:37.120
hole, causing the galaxy to spiral and form
into a disk shape.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.140
Some of these galaxies are special: the supermassive
black hole is consuming more than the normal

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.579
amount of the galaxy around it, and faster--it’s
greedy.

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:51.379
These are called active galactic nuclei, or
AGN for short.

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:55.299
As the matter in the galaxy gets closer to
the black hole, it heats up and produces all

00:00:55.299 --> 00:01:00.479
kinds of radiation: we’ve got radio, we’ve
got infrared, X-ray, gamma ray--it’s a big

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:01.659
party.

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:05.320
This is called an accretion disk, and even
though we can’t ‘see’ the black hole

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.759
itself, the accretion disk around it is one
of the things we can observe when we’re

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:11.530
looking at AGN.

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.399
Accretion discs are one of a few characteristics
that form our standard model for what AGN

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:17.659
might look like.

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:22.969
Other typical features include gigantic jets
that eject stuff, and a torus (which is a

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:25.610
big donut of galactic material).

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.150
Depending on the circumstances though, we
may not see all the features we’re expecting,

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.979
and different AGN appear to have different
properties.

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:37.340
We’ve currently classified tens of different
kinds, based on observations of things like

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.869
brightness, size, jets, lack of jets and type
of radiation emitted.

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:47.859
They’re divided into radio-quiet and radio-loud
nuclei, and each of these types contains categories

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:52.939
of their own, like Seyfert galaxies, quasars,
and blazars, and each of these categories

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:55.420
has their own subdivisions as well.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:02.399
But there’s a theory that posits something
a little radical, called AGN unification theory.

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:07.689
First proposed back in 1993, it claims that
essentially, all AGN are the same, but they

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:11.150
just LOOK different to us based on their orientation
in space.

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.780
I mean we’re limited, right?

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:18.880
We can’t exactly go out and fly around them
to see them in 360--we only have our perspective

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.560
from here from Earth.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.900
However, supercomputers may be able to help
us figure this out.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:29.000
With simulations, we can model AGN, allowing
us to twist and turn them, seeing what they

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.200
look like and what signals they gives off
from different angles.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.580
Buuuut these models aren’t the perfect answer
to figuring out if AGN unification theory

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:37.580
is right.

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.950
We probably don’t even have all the necessary
data to make the most accurate models of galactic

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:42.950
behavior.

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.650
As we continue to get better at detecting
the signals coming from them, building more

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.350
powerful telescopes and asking even better
questions, hopefully we’ll get there soon.

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.620
It’s kind of awesome and mind blowing to
think about this.

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.370
Because the many different kinds of AGN have
been meticulously observed and grouped by

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.220
attribute, it can be easy as a non-astrophysicist
to say--”yep.

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.690
There they are, all the different kinds of
active galactic nuclei, aren’t we good at

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.790
looking at and labeling things”.

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.020
But then something like the AGN unification
theory comes along and suggests that this

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:18.110
may all be irrelevant because we haven’t
taken into account something as seemingly

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:22.750
simple as perspective...and it really makes
you feel like there’s so much more to be

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:23.750
discovered.

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.750
And our understanding of our universe is so
much more malleable than we may think.

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.720
Science isn’t a set of hard and fast rules,
it’s changing all the time.

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.100
And that might be my favorite part.

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.650

first to know if AGN unification theory turns

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.560
out to be right, and check out this video
here on what happens when galaxies collide.

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.140
Also, quasars are AGN whose cores are so bright
that they outshine all the stars in their

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:46.140
galaxy.

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.090
And quasar stands for quasi-stellar radio
sources.

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.510
I always wondered how they came up with names
like that.

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:50.290
I’m Maren, thanks for watching Seeker.
