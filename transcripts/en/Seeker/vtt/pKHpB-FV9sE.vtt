00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.110
One man's trash is enough to power another
man's home… and a bunch of it can power

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:05.220
20,000 homes…

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.210
So what are we waiting for??

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:20.350
You guys, a company called GreenSky is taking
in sorted municipal and commercial waste and

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:22.330
outputting JET FUEL.

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:23.350
Yep.

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:24.410
Trash to airplane fuel.

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:30.340
Boeing flew a 787 using biofuel last year
to prove it could be done, but GreenSky wants

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.519
to make enough fuel from trash to supply ALL
the needs for London City Airport.

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:40.129
British Airways has pledged to purchase ALL
50,000 metric tons of fuel from GreenSky!

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:45.860
They're going to fly all over using your TRASH
for fuel and also charge you to put a bag

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.699
into the bin… not the trash bin, Brits,
the OVERHEAD bin.

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:51.249
Look, trash is everywhere.

00:00:51.249 --> 00:00:56.280
We throw away 4.3 pounds (2kg) of waste every
day and 55% of all the trash generated in

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.230
the United States goes into landfills.

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.420
But, according to Scientific American, if
we converted the 460 million tons of trash

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.690
produced in North America properly, we could
make 12.4 billion gallons (47B liters) of

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:09.690
ethanol.

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.330
That's a lotta hooch -- roughly the same amount
as produced from all ethanol-bound corn.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.470
And the process is REALLY easy; all you need
is to unleash some sulfuric acid to break

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.390
down the cellulose, and some select enzymes
and microbes to ferment the resulting slurry

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:24.390
into fuel.

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.520
Done, you're flying.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.490
Biofuel from trash is great, but we need to
separate the trash BEFORE we can do that.

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.540
So while we use that in the future, we can
ALSO burn grandpa's trash too!

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:42.670
In 1986 there were over 7,600 small dumps,
today there are around 1900 mega-dumps which

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.170
should have enough capacity for centuries
of garbage.

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.740
In 2008, power from landfills exceeded solar
power production in New York and New Jersey,

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.920
and it's expanded significantly in the last
seven years.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.410
Of the 1900 landfills over 640 have added
the technology to harness the power of landfill

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.970
gases (LFGs) and converting them to energy.

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:11.230
LFG is produced by anaerobic bacteria (bacteria
that doesn't need oxygen) buried deep within

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:12.230
landfills.

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.939
The anaerobic bacteria munch on our trash
and poop out methane which would NORMALLY

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:18.010
be real bad.

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.959
Methane is 20 times more potent a greenhouse
gas than CO2, and according to the EPA, municipal

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:27.430
solid waste is the third-largest source of
human-related methane emissions in the US.

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.400
But, if we capture it before it floats up
and makes climate change worse, we can use

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.829
it for good AND chillax with some oil burning
too.

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:41.329
Methane is an odorless, colorless hydrocarbon
(CH4), and because the bacteria are trapped

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:46.950
underground, companies can find pockets and
suck it out with high-vacuum pipes.

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.969
Once collected, the methane is cooled, cleaned,
and mixed with mercaptan to give it a detectable

00:02:50.969 --> 00:02:55.069
odor before they send it out to natural gas
plants to be burned for fuel.

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:59.840
Yep, natural gas can come from rock, or oil
deposits but that's a "dirty" natural gas,

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.269
a mix of 99 percent methane with some propane,
ethane and sulfur and helium mixed in.

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:08.830
The biomass methane is pretty much just CH4.

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:09.830
Bacteria are good like that.

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.590
The EPA's Landfill Methane Outreach Program
is hoping to encourage companies to set up

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:19.629
on top of landfills and suck in as much methane
as possible, because otherwise we're just

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:21.349
letting dollars float away.

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:26.920
As of 2013, LFG captured energy was powering
1.8 million homes.

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.220
So just to recap, we throw away a lot of stuff
and just let it sit there, but thanks to these

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:55.099
technologies getting trashy could clean up

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:55.170
the world.
