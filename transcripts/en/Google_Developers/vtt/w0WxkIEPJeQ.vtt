00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:04.110
Hi, I'm Jenny on the Glass
Developer Relations team.

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.780
And today, I'm going to show you
how to get up and running

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:09.400
building Glassware with Java.

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.500
So the fastest way to build
Glassware is using the quick

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.090
start projects we have.

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:17.350
They're available in several
different languages.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:19.520
But today, we're talking
about Java.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.520
So let's click here and go
to the Java quick start.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.290
Sometimes you'll want to
look before you leap.

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:28.310
So let's take a look at the demo
to see what we have here.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:32.270
Here's the Java quick start.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.220
It is the easiest way to start
building Glassware.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.700
It provides a foundation for you
to build your projects on

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.970
top of, so you can get started
fast without worrying about

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:45.070
the boilerplate code.

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.880
And it also demonstrates a few
common functions that we think

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.000
your Glassware is going
to include.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.960
You can send timeline items to
one user, with attachments.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.920
You can set items to
all your users.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.910
You can work with
notifications,

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.490
that kind of stuff.

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:04.365
So let's show you how
to get the code.

00:01:04.365 --> 00:01:07.060
You can click on this big button
to go to GitHub and

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.040
download the source code.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.740
Click on the Download
ZIP button.

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:13.640
Watch it download.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:14.930
Then we're going to
go over into our

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.180
terminal to set it up.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.790
First thing we're going to
want to do is unzip it.

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.260
You can see a whole bunch
of files got extracted.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.420
But we only need to modify
one to get started.

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.890
We just need to set some
configuration parameters.

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.075
So we're going to go
in to the directory

00:01:34.075 --> 00:01:36.700
and modify this file--

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:37.950
oauth.properties.

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.150
There are two fields that
we're setting here.

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.950
We're setting our client ID
and our client secret.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.730
You can get both of these
values from the

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.940
Google API's console.

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.000
You can get to the Google API's
console by going to

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.260
code.google.com/apis/console.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.420
So I created a new project.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.040
But if you've never created
one before, one will

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.620
automatically be created
for you.

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.470
The first thing we're going to
do is turn on the Mirror API.

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.250
So we're going to scroll down
and enable the Google Mirror

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.880
API here by clicking
on this toggle.

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.090
You might be asked to
accept some terms.

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.240
Just click Accept.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.260
Next, we're going to set
up the API access.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.550
So we're going to go to the API
Access panel and click on

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.560
the inviting giant
blue button.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.160
Here, we're going to
name our Glassware.

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.620
And then we're going to tell it
a little bit about how our

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.320
project is set up.

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.630
Mirror API Glassware are web
applications, so we'll leave

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:36.970
that set to the default.

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.610
But we're going to start
by running it on

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.360
localhost on our laptop.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:45.550
So we're going to switch it over
to http:// and then type

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.520
into this field localhost.

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.130
And then click Create
Client ID.

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.890
Next, we're going to need to
make one little tweak to this.

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.510
We're going to need to set the
port because the Java quick

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.710
start uses port 8080
by default.

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:06.470
So we'll go in here and add
:8080, making the redirect URI

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:12.470
http://localhost
:8080/oauth2callback.

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.700
We'll click Update, and we're
all set for configuration.

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.220
So we'll copy the client ID.

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:23.670
And we will set it
in this file.

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.930
And then we're going to grab
the client secret two lines

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.845
below and also add
it to this file.

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:32.450
We're going to save our file.

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.200
And our configuration
is all set.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.110
Next, we're going to build and
start our quick start project.

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.300
The Java quick start uses
Maven for dependency

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:43.190
management and build.

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:46.490
And it also uses a jetty
plugin for execution.

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:52.690
So you need one command to start
this up-- mvn jetty:run.

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.580
So we're going to press Enter,
fire that command off.

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:57.740
And this may run a little bit
longer on your system.

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:00.150
But I already have all
the dependencies.

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:01.640
We can see that it
has started up.

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:02.890
So let's take a look
in a web browser.

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.270
Go to localhost port 8080.

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:09.900
The Glassware is going to
ask for permissions.

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.200
You can click Accept and allow
the quick start project to

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.140
start working with your Glass.

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.579
And right away, it inserts a
welcome message, which has

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:20.730
already been delivered
to my Glass.

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:23.250
You can click these buttons
below to do some other

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.050
functions, like insert a
picture of Chipotle.

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:28.012
And that's it.

00:04:28.012 --> 00:04:29.640
That's all you need to
do to get started.

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.070
From here, you can modify the
quick start project to add

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.380
your own features and functions
and just use as a

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.780
foundation for your interesting
project.

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.770
Thanks a lot for watching me
guide you through the Java

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:40.690
quick start.

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:41.940
I look forward to
what you create.
