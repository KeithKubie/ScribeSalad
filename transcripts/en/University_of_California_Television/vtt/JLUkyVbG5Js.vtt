00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.524
- And so now we are pleased
to invite to the podium

00:00:17.524 --> 00:00:21.477
Dr. Bennett Leventhal who's
professor of psychiatry

00:00:21.477 --> 00:00:25.398
and training director in child
and adolescent psychiatry

00:00:25.398 --> 00:00:28.731
and Deputy Directory of the
UCSF STAR Program for Autism

00:00:28.731 --> 00:00:32.323
Spectrum Disorders and
Neurodevelopmental Disorders

00:00:32.323 --> 00:00:33.763
at Langley Porter.

00:00:33.763 --> 00:00:38.610
He is an active investigator
and practicing clinician.

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.788
His research includes
studies of the epidemiology

00:00:41.788 --> 00:00:45.811
and causes of autism
spectrum disorders as well as

00:00:45.811 --> 00:00:48.148
other neurodevelopmental disorders.

00:00:48.148 --> 00:00:51.206
And he's involved with a
number of clinical trials

00:00:51.206 --> 00:00:53.816
to improve outcomes in these conditions.

00:00:53.816 --> 00:00:54.983
Dr. Leventhal.

00:00:57.007 --> 00:00:59.292
(applause)

00:00:59.292 --> 00:01:00.125
Thank you.

00:01:02.518 --> 00:01:03.769
- Hi there, it's Friday afternoon.

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:05.352
I'll go fast, okay?

00:01:06.918 --> 00:01:09.905
Let's see if I can get
the slides to go forward.

00:01:09.905 --> 00:01:12.363
Okay, these are my disclosures.

00:01:12.363 --> 00:01:14.200
I've done a couple clinical
trials, but none of them

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.700
are relevant directly to this.

00:01:18.497 --> 00:01:19.950
Okay.

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.722
So, I'm gonna talk about
Autism Spectrum Disorder

00:01:22.722 --> 00:01:25.558
but in many ways there
are things about ASD that

00:01:25.558 --> 00:01:28.231
really reflect broadly into
other neurodevelopmental

00:01:28.231 --> 00:01:31.340
disorders, and I hope by
the end you'll understand

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.924
that many of the treatments
are not terribly specific

00:01:34.924 --> 00:01:37.333
and that this is really
a broad group of patients

00:01:37.333 --> 00:01:41.500
that have a whole variety
of overlapping symptoms.

00:01:43.855 --> 00:01:46.424
So what's a neurodevelopmental disorder?

00:01:46.424 --> 00:01:48.659
Well, it's something
that's usually syndromal.

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.849
Now syndromal is slightly
different from what

00:01:51.849 --> 00:01:53.894
Dr. Sher talked about.

00:01:53.894 --> 00:01:56.588
It means that it's a--I'll
explain in a minute--

00:01:56.588 --> 00:01:58.384
but it's a group of symptoms
that I'll talk about.

00:01:58.384 --> 00:02:01.856
Almost all these disorders
begin in childhood,

00:02:01.856 --> 00:02:05.017
and usually early
childhood if not in utero.

00:02:05.017 --> 00:02:07.974
They all affect brain functioning
in some way or another

00:02:07.974 --> 00:02:11.012
and they have clinical effects
on emotions, cognitions,

00:02:11.012 --> 00:02:12.095
and behavior.

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.311
By DSM5, this is the list of
neurodevelopmental disorders,

00:02:17.311 --> 00:02:19.636
and it's a long list.

00:02:19.636 --> 00:02:22.208
The ones we're gonna
primarily talk about now

00:02:22.208 --> 00:02:25.345
are Autism Spectrum Disorder
and a related condition

00:02:25.345 --> 00:02:27.633
called Social Communication Disorder.

00:02:27.633 --> 00:02:30.698
That is it's basically ASD
but without the restrictive

00:02:30.698 --> 00:02:33.574
repetitive and stereotype behaviors.

00:02:33.574 --> 00:02:36.103
But in some sense, many
of these conditions

00:02:36.103 --> 00:02:40.888
can have some of the symptoms
that we're interested in.

00:02:40.888 --> 00:02:45.094
And by the way, even
though DSM reflects that

00:02:45.094 --> 00:02:47.828
as the list of
neurodevelopmental disorders,

00:02:47.828 --> 00:02:50.692
I would advise you to
think broadly because

00:02:50.692 --> 00:02:52.612
I think there are very many
other conditions that have

00:02:52.612 --> 00:02:56.523
early onset that follow
a disrupted development

00:02:56.523 --> 00:02:58.949
and actually have symptoms
that also overlap.

00:02:58.949 --> 00:03:02.453
And some of you might be
surprised to see Alzheimer's

00:03:02.453 --> 00:03:05.664
on that list, but in fact,
there's gonna be, I think,

00:03:05.664 --> 00:03:08.479
growing evidence that
you'll be able to detect

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:10.125
some of the pathology
of Alzheimer's disease

00:03:10.125 --> 00:03:14.258
in genetically vulnerable
individuals very early in life.

00:03:14.258 --> 00:03:15.567
So what is autism?

00:03:15.567 --> 00:03:16.615
It's a syndrome.

00:03:16.615 --> 00:03:17.905
A syndrome is a group
of symptoms that tend

00:03:17.905 --> 00:03:19.807
to cluster together.

00:03:19.807 --> 00:03:22.274
It doesn't say that
everybody has all of them.

00:03:22.274 --> 00:03:23.961
And they tend to cluster
together in shared

00:03:23.961 --> 00:03:25.221
common natural history.

00:03:25.221 --> 00:03:28.145
That is, they get better
or worse over time.

00:03:28.145 --> 00:03:31.580
A disease is a syndrome for
which there's a known cause

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.538
or for which there's a known
pathophysiologic process

00:03:34.538 --> 00:03:35.614
or both.

00:03:35.614 --> 00:03:37.707
Most of the things that we talk about,

00:03:37.707 --> 00:03:39.901
even if we know the
gene, we don't actually

00:03:39.901 --> 00:03:42.398
often know the pathophysiology, that is

00:03:42.398 --> 00:03:44.757
actually what's happened,
what's disrupted in the brain

00:03:44.757 --> 00:03:47.041
to cause the kind of symptoms we have.

00:03:47.041 --> 00:03:50.130
So most of the things we talk
about in neurodevelopmental

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.649
terms in developmental
disabilities are syndromes.

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:55.393
And we don't really know the cause.

00:03:55.393 --> 00:03:57.191
That doesn't mean we can't do anything.

00:03:57.191 --> 00:03:59.974
And by the way, most medical
conditions are syndromes.

00:03:59.974 --> 00:04:03.061
Diabetes, cardiovascular disease, asthma.

00:04:03.061 --> 00:04:04.191
We can go down the list.

00:04:04.191 --> 00:04:05.735
Most of them are syndromes.

00:04:05.735 --> 00:04:07.391
And we don't really know
what the causes are,

00:04:07.391 --> 00:04:09.646
but we actually have treatments.

00:04:09.646 --> 00:04:11.860
Now most people when they think about

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.843
Autism Spectrum Disorder they think about

00:04:13.843 --> 00:04:16.926
what's in the lay media or in movies.

00:04:17.813 --> 00:04:20.507
And in some cases, they're
quite good depictions

00:04:20.507 --> 00:04:22.809
and in some cases they aren't.

00:04:22.809 --> 00:04:25.900
But what's good to remember is
how diverse these people are.

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.902
That they're very
different characterizations

00:04:27.902 --> 00:04:30.166
of the same syndrome however artistically

00:04:30.166 --> 00:04:32.372
they might be portrayed.

00:04:32.372 --> 00:04:35.656
Of course, I think one
of the best depictions is

00:04:35.656 --> 00:04:37.231
of a high-functioning
individual is "Temple Grandin"

00:04:37.231 --> 00:04:39.167
with Claire Danes.

00:04:39.167 --> 00:04:41.742
Even Temple Grandin
thought it was pretty good.

00:04:41.742 --> 00:04:43.663
(laughter)

00:04:43.663 --> 00:04:46.232
So the term autism came
from a man by the name

00:04:46.232 --> 00:04:49.047
of Leo Kanner who in
1943 wrote a paper called

00:04:49.047 --> 00:04:52.347
"Autistic Disturbances
of Affective Contact"

00:04:52.347 --> 00:04:54.867
in a journal called The Nervous Child.

00:04:54.867 --> 00:04:57.059
We no longer have the
journal, but we still have

00:04:57.059 --> 00:04:59.855
nervous children and parents.

00:04:59.855 --> 00:05:02.111
And they're concerned about these kids.

00:05:02.111 --> 00:05:05.159
But in fact, autism didn't begin in 1943.

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:08.105
It's been around for as long
as there's been human beings.

00:05:08.105 --> 00:05:11.716
A very famous case is
the wild boy of Aveyron,

00:05:11.716 --> 00:05:14.502
a boy who was found
wandering around in the town

00:05:14.502 --> 00:05:17.531
of Averyron in the late 1700s

00:05:17.531 --> 00:05:20.458
and was picked up by Itard.

00:05:20.458 --> 00:05:23.069
Itard is on the left and
Victor's on the right.

00:05:23.069 --> 00:05:26.666
And Itard took Victor to
Paris and tried to train him,

00:05:26.666 --> 00:05:28.940
and Victor learned many things, how to sit

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.969
at a dinner table, how to
dress, but he never learned

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:35.585
to speak and all of his
social skills were quite rote.

00:05:35.585 --> 00:05:38.438
But there are many other
case reports like this.

00:05:38.438 --> 00:05:41.721
Now it also reflects in some
sense the kind of concerns

00:05:41.721 --> 00:05:43.590
people had about causes.

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:47.550
They thought Victor was
raised by wolves in the forest

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:51.088
and that's why he wasn't
properly civilized.

00:05:51.088 --> 00:05:54.164
In point of fact, Victor
was probably developmentally

00:05:54.164 --> 00:05:57.454
disabled and in those days
you could kill your children.

00:05:57.454 --> 00:05:59.621
It was perfectly permissible.

00:05:59.621 --> 00:06:00.812
It wasn't illegal because children were

00:06:00.812 --> 00:06:02.973
thought of as property.

00:06:02.973 --> 00:06:04.732
And this was a very kind family.

00:06:04.732 --> 00:06:07.189
Instead of killing their child,
they just turned him loose

00:06:07.189 --> 00:06:10.023
in the forest, and he
came out the other side

00:06:10.023 --> 00:06:12.827
and got found by Itard and
moved to Paris and lived

00:06:12.827 --> 00:06:16.168
a better life than his
parents probably did.

00:06:16.168 --> 00:06:19.935
Just goes to show, there is some justice.

00:06:19.935 --> 00:06:22.365
Lucky he wasn't an immigrant.

00:06:22.365 --> 00:06:24.615
(laughter)

00:06:26.724 --> 00:06:29.830
So these are DSM5 criteria for ASD.

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:31.641
You'll see that they
are two main criteria,

00:06:31.641 --> 00:06:34.903
deficits and social
communication, social interaction

00:06:34.903 --> 00:06:36.842
and B, the restricted,
repetitive patterns of behavior,

00:06:36.842 --> 00:06:39.057
interests, and activities.

00:06:39.057 --> 00:06:43.741
And these are the basic
diagnostic tools that we use,

00:06:43.741 --> 00:06:46.545
but as you can see there are
a large group of symptoms

00:06:46.545 --> 00:06:48.778
and how one aggregates them
and the extent to which

00:06:48.778 --> 00:06:51.781
they impair somebody is highly variable.

00:06:51.781 --> 00:06:54.552
By the way, this is Social
Communication Disorder,

00:06:54.552 --> 00:06:56.616
and you can see it's
very similar but it says

00:06:56.616 --> 00:06:59.409
that the social communication
abilities are disrupted

00:06:59.409 --> 00:07:02.427
because of language
function, and it doesn't have

00:07:02.427 --> 00:07:06.594
the--it doesn't have the
restricted repetitive behaviors.

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:10.839
I think the story about
this remains to be told.

00:07:10.839 --> 00:07:13.640
I'm not sure that we really
know how different it is.

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:16.020
And it may be a distinction
without a difference

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:18.812
in the long term, but we'll find out.

00:07:18.812 --> 00:07:20.754
Now when it comes to thinking about

00:07:20.754 --> 00:07:23.688
Autism Spectrum Disorders
I actually just include

00:07:23.688 --> 00:07:25.271
Social Communication
Disorder when we think

00:07:25.271 --> 00:07:26.155
about its treatment.

00:07:26.155 --> 00:07:27.000
So it's a syndrome.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.979
It characterized by developmental delays

00:07:28.979 --> 00:07:30.767
and developmental deviations.

00:07:30.767 --> 00:07:32.159
That is things occur that don't occur

00:07:32.159 --> 00:07:33.794
in typical development.

00:07:33.794 --> 00:07:36.009
The domains of impairment
are largely in the areas

00:07:36.009 --> 00:07:38.520
of social development, as we've discussed,

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:41.454
with disruptions in joint
attention, theory of mind,

00:07:41.454 --> 00:07:44.055
and difficulties with reciprocity.

00:07:44.055 --> 00:07:46.159
Joint attention is the
ability to join other people

00:07:46.159 --> 00:07:48.096
in what they're paying attention to

00:07:48.096 --> 00:07:50.446
and theory of mind is to have
a notion that someone else

00:07:50.446 --> 00:07:53.758
has thoughts just like you do and that you

00:07:53.758 --> 00:07:55.910
have to be able to respond to those.

00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:58.297
They're communication problems,
as has been mentioned,

00:07:58.297 --> 00:08:01.621
and then this set of unusual behaviors.

00:08:01.621 --> 00:08:03.551
The course is consistent over time.

00:08:03.551 --> 00:08:06.343
That is most people with
ASD get better over time

00:08:06.343 --> 00:08:08.476
with a few exceptions, Rett Syndrome

00:08:08.476 --> 00:08:11.565
being one of them and some
of the other syndromes

00:08:11.565 --> 00:08:13.115
that Dr. Sher talked about where there's

00:08:13.115 --> 00:08:14.966
continuing damage to the brain.

00:08:14.966 --> 00:08:17.669
But most of the people we
know get better over time.

00:08:17.669 --> 00:08:20.025
Some of the symptoms seem
to diminish over time,

00:08:20.025 --> 00:08:23.146
particularly the repetitive
behaviors and the problems

00:08:23.146 --> 00:08:25.868
with looking people--having visual regard.

00:08:25.868 --> 00:08:29.221
Other symptoms persist
and don't seem to go away.

00:08:29.221 --> 00:08:31.545
Problems with social
reciprocity, language,

00:08:31.545 --> 00:08:36.525
and the restricted repetitive
behaviors of certain types

00:08:36.525 --> 00:08:38.506
such as persistent interest
in things or difficulty

00:08:38.506 --> 00:08:41.756
making changes, insistence on sameness.

00:08:42.611 --> 00:08:45.007
By the way, if we know some
of them change over time,

00:08:45.007 --> 00:08:48.129
it's gonna actually have an
implication for treatment.

00:08:48.129 --> 00:08:49.104
And we'll get to that in a minute.

00:08:49.104 --> 00:08:52.760
So what of the--if it's a
spectrum, Autism Spectrum Disorder

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:54.294
what constitutes the spectrum?

00:08:54.294 --> 00:08:57.312
Well, the symptoms themselves,
these little unusual

00:08:57.312 --> 00:09:00.653
autism behaviors, insistence
on sameness, rocking,

00:09:00.653 --> 00:09:03.649
things of that sort, and
then--but also language skills,

00:09:03.649 --> 00:09:07.419
the ability to communicate,
language being broadly

00:09:07.419 --> 00:09:09.259
not just speech but the full spectrum of

00:09:09.259 --> 00:09:11.318
communicative behaviors.

00:09:11.318 --> 00:09:15.993
The severity of social skills
and then intellectual ability.

00:09:15.993 --> 00:09:19.122
So in a sense, if you're
on the far left hand--

00:09:19.122 --> 00:09:22.567
let's see--left hand side of
this picture, and you have

00:09:22.567 --> 00:09:24.599
mild in all those areas,
you're gonna appear to be

00:09:24.599 --> 00:09:27.452
higher functioning, so-called,
and if you have more

00:09:27.452 --> 00:09:30.296
severe impairment, you're
gonna end up on the other

00:09:30.296 --> 00:09:32.279
side of the spectrum.

00:09:32.279 --> 00:09:36.198
And it'll vary because the
symptom picture varies.

00:09:36.198 --> 00:09:38.435
Remember it's a syndrome,
so not everybody has

00:09:38.435 --> 00:09:43.013
all the same symptoms or
symptoms of the same severity.

00:09:43.013 --> 00:09:44.253
So what causes it?

00:09:44.253 --> 00:09:47.627
Well, you've heard
about--Dr. Sher talked about

00:09:47.627 --> 00:09:51.657
genes or chromosomal
syndromes and other kinds of

00:09:51.657 --> 00:09:54.790
genetics that suggest that
there's an increased risk

00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:58.568
if you have a sibling or
a family member with ASD,

00:09:58.568 --> 00:10:01.219
but there are other things
that can cause ASD as well

00:10:01.219 --> 00:10:03.263
as Dr. Sher has shown you.

00:10:03.263 --> 00:10:06.118
I think one of the critical
things that we need to remember

00:10:06.118 --> 00:10:08.239
is that there probably
isn't a single cause,

00:10:08.239 --> 00:10:09.805
there are probably many, and they're not

00:10:09.805 --> 00:10:11.105
a single genetic cause.

00:10:11.105 --> 00:10:13.747
And genes interact with the
environment and so to say

00:10:13.747 --> 00:10:16.713
there's an environmental
or is it biological,

00:10:16.713 --> 00:10:18.213
the answer is yes.

00:10:19.984 --> 00:10:23.052
And thinking about it dichotomously
is not really helpful.

00:10:23.052 --> 00:10:26.576
That's not to say that bad
mothers, as an environmental

00:10:26.576 --> 00:10:28.099
factor, cause autism.

00:10:28.099 --> 00:10:29.723
They do not.

00:10:29.723 --> 00:10:31.106
They can not.

00:10:31.106 --> 00:10:34.743
As powerful as mothers are,
they can't cause autism.

00:10:34.743 --> 00:10:37.378
They can cause lots of other
aggravation, but not...

00:10:37.378 --> 00:10:39.361
(laughter)

00:10:39.361 --> 00:10:42.042
But I would point out, dads
can too, and aunts and uncles

00:10:42.042 --> 00:10:43.534
and grandmas and everybody.

00:10:43.534 --> 00:10:45.729
We can all impact children.

00:10:45.729 --> 00:10:48.776
But what is important to
remember is even if it's

00:10:48.776 --> 00:10:51.104
a basic biological disorder,
which I think most of us

00:10:51.104 --> 00:10:56.091
believe, experience in life
around you as you develop,

00:10:56.091 --> 00:10:58.764
the quality of education,
the quality of services,

00:10:58.764 --> 00:11:01.231
the quality of parenting,
the quality of nutrition,

00:11:01.231 --> 00:11:03.771
the quality of healthcare,
all those things impact all

00:11:03.771 --> 00:11:05.997
of our development including
children with autism.

00:11:05.997 --> 00:11:07.214
They're not immune.

00:11:07.214 --> 00:11:08.963
And they may be even more
vulnerable to some of those

00:11:08.963 --> 00:11:10.796
environmental factors.

00:11:12.316 --> 00:11:15.688
So what about treatment,
which is what I'm really

00:11:15.688 --> 00:11:17.659
supposed to be talking about.

00:11:17.659 --> 00:11:19.517
Well, treatment begins with, first of all,

00:11:19.517 --> 00:11:21.519
understanding that we're
dealing with a group

00:11:21.519 --> 00:11:24.302
of symptoms not necessarily
a specific disease

00:11:24.302 --> 00:11:25.773
for which we know a cause.

00:11:25.773 --> 00:11:27.330
We're not treating a cause.

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:29.879
And you have to start by
carefully assessing the patients.

00:11:29.879 --> 00:11:32.105
It's what Dr. Sher talked about earlier

00:11:32.105 --> 00:11:33.830
and we're gonna reiterate.

00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:36.302
You really have to do
a careful assessment.

00:11:36.302 --> 00:11:38.293
And what constitutes a careful assessment?

00:11:38.293 --> 00:11:41.483
You have to screen for a
broad variety of potential

00:11:41.483 --> 00:11:43.909
causes or problems, ranging from genetic

00:11:43.909 --> 00:11:45.831
to environmental factors.

00:11:45.831 --> 00:11:48.309
You have to interview the patient.

00:11:48.309 --> 00:11:49.732
You have to talk to them.

00:11:49.732 --> 00:11:53.125
I know, you say well, kids
with autism don't always talk.

00:11:53.125 --> 00:11:55.775
First of all, the vast
majority of them talk.

00:11:55.775 --> 00:11:59.513
They may not talk in ways that's
the easiest to understand,

00:11:59.513 --> 00:12:01.079
but they can communicate

00:12:01.079 --> 00:12:03.944
and spending time with them is important.

00:12:03.944 --> 00:12:06.963
Of course, taking histories
from family members,

00:12:06.963 --> 00:12:09.085
and you actually have to
see the kid and see them

00:12:09.085 --> 00:12:11.320
interact in the environment around them.

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:13.209
There are a whole variety
of standard diagnostic

00:12:13.209 --> 00:12:15.369
instruments which have
been well established,

00:12:15.369 --> 00:12:18.167
are empirically valid which
should always be used,

00:12:18.167 --> 00:12:20.939
but just because you
can get an ADI, Autism

00:12:20.939 --> 00:12:23.458
Diagnostic Interview, or
ADOS, Autism Diagnostic

00:12:23.458 --> 00:12:26.993
Observation Schedule,
be positive it still is

00:12:26.993 --> 00:12:28.976
a clinical diagnosis.

00:12:28.976 --> 00:12:31.483
So just because you get a
test score that's positive

00:12:31.483 --> 00:12:34.247
doesn't mean that they
have or if it's negative

00:12:34.247 --> 00:12:35.660
that they don't have the disorder.

00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:37.233
It's information that helps you.

00:12:37.233 --> 00:12:39.499
And then you have to look
at adaptive functioning.

00:12:39.499 --> 00:12:42.514
So it's not just that you have a disorder

00:12:42.514 --> 00:12:44.986
but how it impairs it your
life and how it impairs

00:12:44.986 --> 00:12:47.615
your living because in fact
the kind of treatments we do

00:12:47.615 --> 00:12:50.765
are designed to improve the
quality of life and the skills

00:12:50.765 --> 00:12:54.442
of the individual, not
just take away the symptoms

00:12:54.442 --> 00:12:56.364
that make a diagnosis.

00:12:56.364 --> 00:12:59.936
And Dr. Sher made a
cogent point about doing

00:12:59.936 --> 00:13:01.745
a careful examination.

00:13:01.745 --> 00:13:03.695
These kids are not always easy to do

00:13:03.695 --> 00:13:06.215
physical examinations on and as a result

00:13:06.215 --> 00:13:09.709
many physicians,
pediatricians in particular,

00:13:09.709 --> 00:13:11.782
will just brush through the exam.

00:13:11.782 --> 00:13:13.488
And these kids, more than anybody else,

00:13:13.488 --> 00:13:15.093
deserve a thorough exam.

00:13:15.093 --> 00:13:17.279
I can't tell you, and
I'm guessing that Elliot

00:13:17.279 --> 00:13:19.644
will do the same thing,
and tell you how many kids,

00:13:19.644 --> 00:13:22.480
young kids I've seen who
had sensory impairment

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:23.862
who looked like they had autism.

00:13:23.862 --> 00:13:25.649
They couldn't hear or they couldn't see.

00:13:25.649 --> 00:13:28.503
And when you carefully
examine them, you find out

00:13:28.503 --> 00:13:31.257
that they can't--and you help them see

00:13:31.257 --> 00:13:34.740
and you help them hear, they
do a lot better socially.

00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:38.518
Although sometimes if I don't
hear I do better socially, too

00:13:38.518 --> 00:13:40.734
but that's another story altogether.

00:13:40.734 --> 00:13:42.542
And then of course there
are laboratory tests

00:13:42.542 --> 00:13:45.021
that Dr. Sher's talked about.

00:13:45.021 --> 00:13:48.202
Now one of the factors
that predict outcomes

00:13:48.202 --> 00:13:50.440
for kids, with people with autism--

00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:51.688
why do I want to know this?

00:13:51.688 --> 00:13:54.694
Because if I can change
them, then it'll improve

00:13:54.694 --> 00:13:58.079
their outcomes, so
expressive language by having

00:13:58.079 --> 00:14:01.106
communicative speech by the age of 5

00:14:01.106 --> 00:14:03.260
and understanding spoken
language by the age of 5

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:06.070
seems to have pretty
good prognostic features.

00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:08.429
That would make you think right away,

00:14:08.429 --> 00:14:10.452
speech and language services would be

00:14:10.452 --> 00:14:12.259
really important, right?

00:14:12.259 --> 00:14:13.492
Intellectual capacity.

00:14:13.492 --> 00:14:16.509
Not a lot we can do to
change intellectual capacity.

00:14:16.509 --> 00:14:19.432
Adaptive function, teaching kids skills.

00:14:19.432 --> 00:14:21.934
And then the severity
of autism symptoms, like

00:14:21.934 --> 00:14:24.433
social deficits, restricted,
repetitive behaviors,

00:14:24.433 --> 00:14:25.520
and aggression.

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:28.366
Notice they're way down
at the bottom there.

00:14:28.366 --> 00:14:30.112
Sadly those are the
ones--I'm going to talk

00:14:30.112 --> 00:14:34.103
about medications--are the
ones we can deal with most.

00:14:34.103 --> 00:14:37.082
And what I'm telling you
is that the most important

00:14:37.082 --> 00:14:39.651
interventions really are
not things that we use

00:14:39.651 --> 00:14:40.984
medications for.

00:14:42.342 --> 00:14:45.096
So these are the kind of
interventions that you

00:14:45.096 --> 00:14:48.196
should be using and
pharmacotherapy is just one

00:14:48.196 --> 00:14:50.622
and at the bottom of the list.

00:14:50.622 --> 00:14:51.699
Okay.

00:14:51.699 --> 00:14:54.088
So which behaviors can we deal with?

00:14:54.088 --> 00:14:57.359
We have to take the
symptoms out of the syndrome

00:14:57.359 --> 00:14:59.663
and say which of the
symptoms from the syndrome

00:14:59.663 --> 00:15:00.913
can we address?

00:15:01.877 --> 00:15:04.213
So let's--the first one that seems to be

00:15:04.213 --> 00:15:07.161
very disruptive and interferes
with children's lives

00:15:07.161 --> 00:15:09.293
are the restricted and
repetitive behaviors.

00:15:09.293 --> 00:15:11.732
Now let me just talk
about those for a moment.

00:15:11.732 --> 00:15:14.649
You know them very well,
but it includes getting

00:15:14.649 --> 00:15:17.868
fixated on a particular object or watching

00:15:17.868 --> 00:15:21.769
Finding Nemo over and over and over again

00:15:21.769 --> 00:15:25.295
or worse than that a two
minute interval of Finding Nemo

00:15:25.295 --> 00:15:27.712
over and over and over again.

00:15:29.164 --> 00:15:33.036
And when you make the
child stop doing that,

00:15:33.036 --> 00:15:36.612
they get really upset and can tantrum.

00:15:36.612 --> 00:15:39.172
Now there are a number
of problems with that

00:15:39.172 --> 00:15:40.258
particular kind of behavior.

00:15:40.258 --> 00:15:41.680
There's nothing wrong with Nemo.

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:43.709
I mean, Nemo's an okay guy.

00:15:43.709 --> 00:15:46.527
But the problem is if that's all you do,

00:15:46.527 --> 00:15:48.396
then you can't learn other stuff.

00:15:48.396 --> 00:15:50.569
And you can't engage socially
in the rest of the world

00:15:50.569 --> 00:15:53.037
around you and if anybody
tries to change it

00:15:53.037 --> 00:15:55.293
then you get all bent out of shape,

00:15:55.293 --> 00:15:57.641
that makes it difficult for people to then

00:15:57.641 --> 00:15:59.092
move you on to other things.

00:15:59.092 --> 00:16:01.568
This whole principle of
insistence on sameness,

00:16:01.568 --> 00:16:05.179
the difficulty in making changes,
changing the environment,

00:16:05.179 --> 00:16:07.481
if you move a piece of furniture
or something in the house

00:16:07.481 --> 00:16:10.998
and the child gets upset,
or if they have to change

00:16:10.998 --> 00:16:13.934
from reading class to mathematics class

00:16:13.934 --> 00:16:16.638
and they fall apart, it
makes it very difficult

00:16:16.638 --> 00:16:19.787
to provide education for them.

00:16:19.787 --> 00:16:23.810
And the world in which we
live isn't fixed and stable.

00:16:23.810 --> 00:16:27.128
So learning how to participate
in the broader world

00:16:27.128 --> 00:16:31.011
around you so that you can
go to school and go to church

00:16:31.011 --> 00:16:35.178
or go to Boy Scouts or
Girl Scouts or play sports,

00:16:36.334 --> 00:16:38.235
in order to do those
things, you have to have

00:16:38.235 --> 00:16:39.910
some flexibility.

00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:42.258
So this is one of the
behaviors that we think

00:16:42.258 --> 00:16:45.964
we can make some headway
with by using medications.

00:16:45.964 --> 00:16:48.963
I'm gonna at the end
caution you about all this,

00:16:48.963 --> 00:16:51.653
but in the beginning we'll talk about.

00:16:51.653 --> 00:16:54.406
So the medications that seem
to be the most effective

00:16:54.406 --> 00:16:57.015
in doing this at the
moment are the Selective

00:16:57.015 --> 00:17:00.462
Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors, or SSRIs.

00:17:00.462 --> 00:17:03.559
And this is a list of all
of them, Prozac and Zoloft

00:17:03.559 --> 00:17:06.261
are probably the best known.

00:17:06.261 --> 00:17:09.716
But the--and how did we
figure out to do this?

00:17:09.716 --> 00:17:12.722
Well, we actually didn't
figure it out in autism.

00:17:12.722 --> 00:17:15.910
It turned out there were a bunch of dogs

00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:18.655
that had repetitive behaviors,
something they called

00:17:18.655 --> 00:17:21.469
acral lick syndrome, where
they lick the perianal glands

00:17:21.469 --> 00:17:24.600
and they would do it so
badly that they would

00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:27.168
get themselves infected
and actually could die.

00:17:27.168 --> 00:17:29.636
And someone figured out
that if you gave them a drug

00:17:29.636 --> 00:17:32.126
called a Anafranil or clomipramine,
the one on the bottom,

00:17:32.126 --> 00:17:35.316
they would stop doing
this repetitive behavior.

00:17:35.316 --> 00:17:38.726
So then people tried to
use it in humans who had

00:17:38.726 --> 00:17:41.542
compulsive disorders,
obsessive compulsive disorder,

00:17:41.542 --> 00:17:44.307
and it worked to a moderate
degree, and then finally

00:17:44.307 --> 00:17:46.140
it got used in autism.

00:17:47.616 --> 00:17:49.930
But for other kids,
including children with

00:17:49.930 --> 00:17:53.282
intellectual disability who
have these kinds of behaviors.

00:17:53.282 --> 00:17:55.816
And it had a moderate amount of success.

00:17:55.816 --> 00:17:58.620
This is one of the
earlier papers looking at

00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:02.225
children with autism using a measure

00:18:02.225 --> 00:18:04.735
obsessive compulsive
behaviors and you can see that

00:18:04.735 --> 00:18:05.985
the kids with--

00:18:08.961 --> 00:18:12.566
the placebo's on the top and
with ASD got substantially

00:18:12.566 --> 00:18:16.366
better in a relatively
short period of time.

00:18:16.366 --> 00:18:19.486
And when you looked at
their overall outcome,

00:18:19.486 --> 00:18:22.249
just their global improvement
in taking every aspect

00:18:22.249 --> 00:18:25.317
of their behavior, there
was a really statistically

00:18:25.317 --> 00:18:28.446
significant difference
between the kids who were

00:18:28.446 --> 00:18:30.769
on placebo and the kids
who were on, in this case,

00:18:30.769 --> 00:18:32.955
fluoxetine or Prozac.

00:18:32.955 --> 00:18:35.768
So it looks like this makes a difference.

00:18:35.768 --> 00:18:38.451
It doesn't work for
everybody, and in some cases

00:18:38.451 --> 00:18:40.677
it may make them worse
for a variety of reasons,

00:18:40.677 --> 00:18:43.793
but it looks like it
has a powerful effect.

00:18:43.793 --> 00:18:46.231
And when you look at side
effects, which I think

00:18:46.231 --> 00:18:48.172
we always have to do,
and I love this table

00:18:48.172 --> 00:18:50.673
because this is a table
where almost every one

00:18:50.673 --> 00:18:52.978
of the side effects is
worse on the placebo.

00:18:52.978 --> 00:18:54.298
(laughter)

00:18:54.298 --> 00:18:56.310
Well, that's an important
thing to remember,

00:18:56.310 --> 00:18:59.470
that sometimes people
perceive things that may not

00:18:59.470 --> 00:19:02.303
necessarily--that was a good idea.

00:19:03.868 --> 00:19:07.516
So sometimes people
perceive things that may not

00:19:07.516 --> 00:19:11.812
actually be relevant to or
causal by the medication.

00:19:11.812 --> 00:19:14.311
So it's really important when
we work with our patients

00:19:14.311 --> 00:19:16.007
to help them understand
what the side effects can be

00:19:16.007 --> 00:19:17.840
but also monitor them.

00:19:20.072 --> 00:19:22.246
Next group of symptoms
that are really problematic

00:19:22.246 --> 00:19:26.525
with children with ASD is
aggression and irritability.

00:19:26.525 --> 00:19:30.608
So in the past going back
50 years, 50 years now,

00:19:31.886 --> 00:19:35.886
the use of drugs called
neuroleptics, Thorazine,

00:19:37.455 --> 00:19:41.040
was one of them, or
Haldol, have been shown

00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:44.038
repeatedly in a variety
of settings irrespective

00:19:44.038 --> 00:19:47.175
of the diagnosis that
you can reduce aggression

00:19:47.175 --> 00:19:49.370
in individuals and
irritability in individuals

00:19:49.370 --> 00:19:51.332
by giving them these drugs.

00:19:51.332 --> 00:19:53.515
These drugs had many awful
side effects and many

00:19:53.515 --> 00:19:56.066
patients won't take
them and so there's now

00:19:56.066 --> 00:19:59.000
a new group of drugs called
atypical neuroleptics

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.385
or second generation neuroleptics
and two of these drugs,

00:20:02.385 --> 00:20:06.915
risperidone or Risperdal
and aripiprazole or Abilify

00:20:06.915 --> 00:20:10.327
have been approved by the FDA on the basis

00:20:10.327 --> 00:20:13.395
of clinical trials to
treat the irritability

00:20:13.395 --> 00:20:14.887
associated with autism.

00:20:14.887 --> 00:20:16.250
Now I want to be clear.

00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:17.602
It's not to treat autism.

00:20:17.602 --> 00:20:20.496
It's to treat irritability
associated with autism,

00:20:20.496 --> 00:20:23.238
the kind of irritability
we talked about in response

00:20:23.238 --> 00:20:24.711
to the stereotyped behaviors.

00:20:24.711 --> 00:20:29.366
Now this was a study done
by an NIH sponsored grant,

00:20:29.366 --> 00:20:32.861
and you can see that the kids,
the green line are the kids

00:20:32.861 --> 00:20:37.432
on risperidone and the kids
on placebo are the gray line,

00:20:37.432 --> 00:20:40.967
and in as quickly as two
weeks, there was significant

00:20:40.967 --> 00:20:43.231
separation between the
kids who were being treated

00:20:43.231 --> 00:20:45.335
and the kids who were not.

00:20:45.335 --> 00:20:48.940
And this treatment and
the effect persisted

00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:52.356
and continued to get better
over an eight-week period.

00:20:52.356 --> 00:20:54.652
And it looks like it stays
sustained in longer studies

00:20:54.652 --> 00:20:55.569
after that.

00:20:56.461 --> 00:21:00.391
About 75% of the kids on
risperidone got much improved

00:21:00.391 --> 00:21:02.868
to very much improved
whereas only 11% if the kids

00:21:02.868 --> 00:21:03.781
on placebo.

00:21:03.781 --> 00:21:06.364
So it's about--I mean it
makes a really big difference

00:21:06.364 --> 00:21:07.531
in these kids.

00:21:08.395 --> 00:21:11.312
But not every behavior gets better.

00:21:12.479 --> 00:21:14.259
And this is important.

00:21:14.259 --> 00:21:16.645
So hyperactivity got better.

00:21:16.645 --> 00:21:19.013
Restricted and repetitive
behaviors got better.

00:21:19.013 --> 00:21:20.882
Aggression got better.

00:21:20.882 --> 00:21:24.661
But the social functioning didn't change.

00:21:24.661 --> 00:21:27.517
And inappropriate speech didn't change.

00:21:27.517 --> 00:21:29.343
It was not statistically different.

00:21:29.343 --> 00:21:31.418
So it doesn't treat the whole syndrome,

00:21:31.418 --> 00:21:34.353
and even by treating part of the syndrome

00:21:34.353 --> 00:21:37.045
doesn't mean that everything
else will get better.

00:21:37.045 --> 00:21:39.972
However, if a child's less
irritable and less aggressive,

00:21:39.972 --> 00:21:42.613
they're probably more
amenable to engage in speech

00:21:42.613 --> 00:21:45.222
and language therapy,
behavior therapy, et cetera.

00:21:45.222 --> 00:21:49.115
And so using this to supplement
those, or to augment them,

00:21:49.115 --> 00:21:51.846
is really the way to think
about it, not how to cure

00:21:51.846 --> 00:21:54.357
the disorder or make all
the symptoms of the syndrome

00:21:54.357 --> 00:21:55.190
go away.

00:21:56.467 --> 00:22:00.378
This is a slightly different
view of side effects,

00:22:00.378 --> 00:22:03.215
just again to give you a
perspective, and the side effect

00:22:03.215 --> 00:22:05.781
that you really want to pay
most attention to on almost

00:22:05.781 --> 00:22:09.113
all the side effects here
are higher on risperidone

00:22:09.113 --> 00:22:12.184
and the one that I think you
need to pay most attention to

00:22:12.184 --> 00:22:13.496
is the one at the very bottom.

00:22:13.496 --> 00:22:16.981
In an eight-week trial,
the average of 49 kids,

00:22:16.981 --> 00:22:20.192
the average child gained
2.7 kilos, which is

00:22:20.192 --> 00:22:24.813
about six pounds versus .8
kilos in the control group.

00:22:24.813 --> 00:22:28.670
So you really have to
watch this and manage it

00:22:28.670 --> 00:22:32.260
because weight gain is a serious problem.

00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:34.768
But there are other symptoms as well.

00:22:34.768 --> 00:22:35.804
Okay.

00:22:35.804 --> 00:22:37.734
Now there are a number of other
drugs that have been around

00:22:37.734 --> 00:22:39.961
for a very long time that
have been shown to decrease

00:22:39.961 --> 00:22:43.484
aggressive behavior again
irrespective of diagnosis.

00:22:43.484 --> 00:22:46.907
One is lithium carbonate
and is a drug we use

00:22:46.907 --> 00:22:49.103
for bipolar disorder but
is extremely effective

00:22:49.103 --> 00:22:51.351
actually across the board.

00:22:51.351 --> 00:22:52.793
So when we have kids that don't respond to

00:22:52.793 --> 00:22:55.190
the neuroleptics, it's
harder to manage this drug

00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:57.344
because you have to use blood
levels and you have to be

00:22:57.344 --> 00:22:59.314
careful to keep the kids well-hydrated.

00:22:59.314 --> 00:23:02.504
But in general it's
extremely effective and has

00:23:02.504 --> 00:23:05.784
relatively fewer side effects
because it's only the lithium

00:23:05.784 --> 00:23:08.315
that doesn't metabolize
into anything else.

00:23:08.315 --> 00:23:11.229
And then there's a drug called
propranolol which has been

00:23:11.229 --> 00:23:13.902
shown to decrease aggressive
behavior in a whole variety

00:23:13.902 --> 00:23:15.670
of individuals including those

00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:17.538
with neurodevelopmental disorders.

00:23:17.538 --> 00:23:18.785
It's the drug Inderal.

00:23:18.785 --> 00:23:20.006
It's an anti-hypertensive.

00:23:20.006 --> 00:23:22.680
But unfortunately, you have to
give it in very large doses.

00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:26.142
Something around 400
to 800 milligrams a day

00:23:26.142 --> 00:23:29.230
which you--it may make some people,

00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:31.883
their blood pressure drop,
although I've had kids

00:23:31.883 --> 00:23:33.680
on 800 milligrams a
day and they don't have

00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:35.854
any blood pressure changes at all.

00:23:35.854 --> 00:23:39.084
So I don't--go figure that out.

00:23:39.084 --> 00:23:40.945
But again, it's another option for us.

00:23:40.945 --> 00:23:44.367
And aggression is the
biggest problem when we have

00:23:44.367 --> 00:23:46.492
presenting patients, and so
trying to find a solution

00:23:46.492 --> 00:23:48.136
is important.

00:23:48.136 --> 00:23:49.812
What about attention deficit disorder?

00:23:49.812 --> 00:23:51.673
First of all, it used to be
said that you couldn't have

00:23:51.673 --> 00:23:52.756
ADHD and ASD.

00:23:54.079 --> 00:23:55.532
Now you can.

00:23:55.532 --> 00:23:57.219
Someone voted and said
it's true, but those of us

00:23:57.219 --> 00:24:00.836
who are clinicians have known it all along

00:24:00.836 --> 00:24:04.169
and so we--many kids with ASD have ADHD.

00:24:06.301 --> 00:24:09.246
And so we treat with
the standard stimulants

00:24:09.246 --> 00:24:10.942
that you're familiar with.

00:24:10.942 --> 00:24:13.331
There are dozens of them now.

00:24:13.331 --> 00:24:17.151
And there are now studies
in children with ASD

00:24:17.151 --> 00:24:19.928
who treating their ADHD
symptom, and this is

00:24:19.928 --> 00:24:22.069
a this is a crossover
trial and it just shows

00:24:22.069 --> 00:24:24.275
that whether you got it--

00:24:24.275 --> 00:24:27.607
that parents, teachers, both
see the kids get better,

00:24:27.607 --> 00:24:31.690
and significantly better in
terms of paying attention.

00:24:31.690 --> 00:24:33.956
So it used to be said
stimulants didn't work with kids

00:24:33.956 --> 00:24:34.789
with ASD.

00:24:36.131 --> 00:24:37.825
That's completely not true.

00:24:37.825 --> 00:24:39.268
It doesn't work for
everybody, but it doesn't

00:24:39.268 --> 00:24:41.141
work for every kid with ADHD either.

00:24:41.141 --> 00:24:44.360
So using stimulants with kids
who have attention problems

00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:46.339
is quite effective.

00:24:46.339 --> 00:24:48.726
For those kids who can't
tolerate stimulants,

00:24:48.726 --> 00:24:51.877
there are some other
non-stimulant medications

00:24:51.877 --> 00:24:54.905
and in particular Strattera
or atomoxetine and then

00:24:54.905 --> 00:24:59.424
the alpha-adrenergic agonists
clonidine and guanfacine.

00:24:59.424 --> 00:25:01.496
There's some recent studies
that show that they're

00:25:01.496 --> 00:25:02.593
moderately effective.

00:25:02.593 --> 00:25:04.421
I don't think that they're
nearly as effective

00:25:04.421 --> 00:25:06.188
as the stimulants.

00:25:06.188 --> 00:25:09.156
I would only use them
either as an augmentation

00:25:09.156 --> 00:25:12.021
or as a--we'll do
questions at the end, okay?

00:25:12.021 --> 00:25:15.161
As a supplement, not
as a primary treatment.

00:25:15.161 --> 00:25:16.421
Some may disagree with me.

00:25:16.421 --> 00:25:17.567
Then mood disturbance.

00:25:17.567 --> 00:25:20.734
Children get, with ASD, get depressed.

00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:24.182
A, what's the surprise about that?

00:25:24.182 --> 00:25:27.819
Autism doesn't protect
you from depression.

00:25:27.819 --> 00:25:31.395
And in fact, it may make
you more vulnerable.

00:25:31.395 --> 00:25:33.548
And if you're higher
functioning, it may be

00:25:33.548 --> 00:25:35.080
a real struggle for you.

00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:38.486
And so there's no reason
to think that treating kids

00:25:38.486 --> 00:25:42.265
with mood disorders with
ASD with the usual suspects

00:25:42.265 --> 00:25:46.432
of the Serotonin Reuptake
Inhibitors is the best option

00:25:47.364 --> 00:25:48.614
for these kids.

00:25:50.878 --> 00:25:55.045
And then finally, and then
in some cases people use

00:25:56.119 --> 00:25:58.477
mood stabilizers like the anticonvulsants.

00:25:58.477 --> 00:26:00.294
This is actually quite
convenient, particularly

00:26:00.294 --> 00:26:02.327
for those kids who have seizure disorders,

00:26:02.327 --> 00:26:06.146
you can get double dipping
with both of these agents.

00:26:06.146 --> 00:26:09.356
Again I want to be clear
there are not studies

00:26:09.356 --> 00:26:12.017
that show that these drugs
specifically work in ASD

00:26:12.017 --> 00:26:15.809
but we have no reason to
believe that they don't.

00:26:15.809 --> 00:26:19.048
What about anxiety disorders?

00:26:19.048 --> 00:26:21.631
Kids with ASD also get anxious.

00:26:22.511 --> 00:26:24.686
I think there's pretty
good evidence that suggests

00:26:24.686 --> 00:26:28.141
that using benzodiazepines
and related drugs for anything

00:26:28.141 --> 00:26:31.026
more than a few doses is
probably not a good idea

00:26:31.026 --> 00:26:32.934
in these--for these kids.

00:26:32.934 --> 00:26:34.887
Probably not a good idea for anybody.

00:26:34.887 --> 00:26:36.472
But that's another story.

00:26:36.472 --> 00:26:40.007
A significant number of
individuals who get benzodiazepines

00:26:40.007 --> 00:26:41.632
have dyscontrol syndromes.

00:26:41.632 --> 00:26:43.359
It's sort of like alcohol.

00:26:43.359 --> 00:26:46.090
And so we have a tendency
for those kids who are

00:26:46.090 --> 00:26:48.325
quite anxious to use again the SSRIs.

00:26:48.325 --> 00:26:51.149
But there, because they work
in treating anxiety disorders

00:26:51.149 --> 00:26:53.770
in other children, in
other people with anxiety,

00:26:53.770 --> 00:26:56.353
not because it's unique to ASD.

00:26:57.489 --> 00:26:59.512
Now there are a bunch of
new medications around

00:26:59.512 --> 00:27:02.283
and Dr. Sher referred to them.

00:27:02.283 --> 00:27:06.196
And they've seen varying
degrees of success.

00:27:06.196 --> 00:27:08.540
Most of the trials are quite small.

00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:10.918
There's a large trial now going on

00:27:10.918 --> 00:27:12.815
of vasopressin 1A antogonist.

00:27:12.815 --> 00:27:15.143
It's a Rauch funded study
and there are a number

00:27:15.143 --> 00:27:16.892
of other companies
getting ready to come out

00:27:16.892 --> 00:27:18.505
and the basic idea is that these drugs

00:27:18.505 --> 00:27:20.943
improve social responsiveness.

00:27:20.943 --> 00:27:22.792
They do in rodents.

00:27:22.792 --> 00:27:25.412
It's not quite clear that
they do in human beings

00:27:25.412 --> 00:27:28.287
and the preliminary data
has been quite uneven.

00:27:28.287 --> 00:27:31.314
Now partly due to very small sample sizes

00:27:31.314 --> 00:27:33.610
and not very well done
studies, but this is something

00:27:33.610 --> 00:27:35.012
to be watching.

00:27:35.012 --> 00:27:37.848
And I think that there's
lots of new drugs coming out

00:27:37.848 --> 00:27:41.798
that are targeting the evolving
biology of the disorder

00:27:41.798 --> 00:27:44.886
and I think you're gonna start
seeing people trying things.

00:27:44.886 --> 00:27:47.385
I would just urge you to be cautious,

00:27:47.385 --> 00:27:50.718
because--wait until the trials are done.

00:27:51.812 --> 00:27:53.602
Because these kids have enough trouble.

00:27:53.602 --> 00:27:56.824
If we give them a drug that
turns out to be a bad idea

00:27:56.824 --> 00:27:59.930
and then it causes damage,
it's the least thing

00:27:59.930 --> 00:28:01.904
we need to do.

00:28:01.904 --> 00:28:04.371
There's an evolving interest
in cognitive enhancers,

00:28:04.371 --> 00:28:07.653
the drugs that we use to treat dementia,

00:28:07.653 --> 00:28:11.717
Alzheimer's disease, and
these look like they may have

00:28:11.717 --> 00:28:13.850
some positive effects,
particularly for individuals

00:28:13.850 --> 00:28:16.187
with intellectual disability,
but I think the effect

00:28:16.187 --> 00:28:17.670
sizes are very small.

00:28:17.670 --> 00:28:20.332
The side effects are
large and so it's a really

00:28:20.332 --> 00:28:22.494
a careful clinical decision
that has to be made.

00:28:22.494 --> 00:28:24.944
But I'd watch this literature
because I think it's gonna

00:28:24.944 --> 00:28:27.309
evolve over the next several years.

00:28:27.309 --> 00:28:29.656
And then there are a
whole variety of other

00:28:29.656 --> 00:28:31.879
complementary and alternative treatments.

00:28:31.879 --> 00:28:33.567
And I'm not going to go through these now

00:28:33.567 --> 00:28:35.468
because you're going to get
one of the world's experts

00:28:35.468 --> 00:28:37.906
to talk about that in Bob
Hendren in a little bit.

00:28:37.906 --> 00:28:40.527
Bob knows more about
this than anybody I know.

00:28:40.527 --> 00:28:44.468
And I think there's some
evidence that there's

00:28:44.468 --> 00:28:47.168
some real potential for
helping people with ASD

00:28:47.168 --> 00:28:50.564
but the sample sizes are
small and so it's hard to know

00:28:50.564 --> 00:28:51.977
for sure what's really working.

00:28:51.977 --> 00:28:54.209
And then there are a
gazillions of other treatments

00:28:54.209 --> 00:28:56.952
that people proposed and
I think our population,

00:28:56.952 --> 00:28:59.898
we need to be very cautious
about using these treatments

00:28:59.898 --> 00:29:01.788
until they're well-established.

00:29:01.788 --> 00:29:03.039
I'm gonna give you an example.

00:29:03.039 --> 00:29:05.364
This is a drug called secretin.

00:29:05.364 --> 00:29:09.378
It is a drug that--it's a
GI hormone that was touted

00:29:09.378 --> 00:29:13.418
as a cure for autism and
as it turns out when you do

00:29:13.418 --> 00:29:15.959
a proper trial the difference
between the placebo

00:29:15.959 --> 00:29:17.992
and the active drug was indistinguishable.

00:29:17.992 --> 00:29:20.817
In fact, the placebo may have
been a little bit better.

00:29:20.817 --> 00:29:23.052
But more importantly had
the potential for causing

00:29:23.052 --> 00:29:25.437
really serious adverse events.

00:29:25.437 --> 00:29:29.501
People could get--develop
a tolerance to this

00:29:29.501 --> 00:29:32.627
or an immunologic reaction
to it because it came

00:29:32.627 --> 00:29:34.701
from pigs and it wasn't
exactly the same as human

00:29:34.701 --> 00:29:37.558
and then it would disrupt
their ability to digest.

00:29:37.558 --> 00:29:39.799
So we have to be careful.

00:29:39.799 --> 00:29:43.031
By the way, this is a drug
that costs $75 a vial to buy

00:29:43.031 --> 00:29:45.003
but people bought it
up and were selling it

00:29:45.003 --> 00:29:47.758
for $3,000 a vial and people
were mortgaging their homes

00:29:47.758 --> 00:29:49.371
and putting kids on this.

00:29:49.371 --> 00:29:51.110
It was just an awful thing.

00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:53.438
Wait for the trials to
be done because they're--

00:29:53.438 --> 00:29:56.584
really, one has to be careful about this.

00:29:56.584 --> 00:29:59.693
Another popular treatment
is chelation where we need

00:29:59.693 --> 00:30:02.081
to get all the heavy
metals out of the body.

00:30:02.081 --> 00:30:04.101
We don't because you
need the heavy metals.

00:30:04.101 --> 00:30:06.670
If you don't have them, you die.

00:30:06.670 --> 00:30:09.026
And in fact, some of the
chelation--kids who have been

00:30:09.026 --> 00:30:10.612
chelated have died.

00:30:10.612 --> 00:30:13.689
So there are lots of proposed
treatments that you can give

00:30:13.689 --> 00:30:16.109
that may seem to make sense,
but until you see a trial

00:30:16.109 --> 00:30:17.938
you don't really want to do it.

00:30:17.938 --> 00:30:21.075
So there are three caveats I
want to give to you as I close.

00:30:21.075 --> 00:30:24.683
Number one, these are
individual patients in a study.

00:30:24.683 --> 00:30:27.353
And you can see some people
get better, some people

00:30:27.353 --> 00:30:29.771
get worse, and some people stay the same.

00:30:29.771 --> 00:30:33.517
So when we tell you that
a study shows something,

00:30:33.517 --> 00:30:35.602
you need to remember that
not everybody in that study

00:30:35.602 --> 00:30:36.801
got better.

00:30:36.801 --> 00:30:41.198
So because we tell you that
SSRIs may work for stereotopies,

00:30:41.198 --> 00:30:43.483
when you go to give it to a
patient, some of your patients

00:30:43.483 --> 00:30:44.986
won't get better.

00:30:44.986 --> 00:30:46.702
It's not because the study
was bad or there's something

00:30:46.702 --> 00:30:48.016
wrong with your patient,
it's just not everybody

00:30:48.016 --> 00:30:49.619
gets better.

00:30:49.619 --> 00:30:52.251
Secondly, all medications
have side effects, and this is

00:30:52.251 --> 00:30:55.473
particularly problematic
in ASD because our patients

00:30:55.473 --> 00:30:58.578
often have difficultly telling
us about their side effects.

00:30:58.578 --> 00:31:00.480
So we have to make sure we query them.

00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:02.755
We need to make sure their
caregivers understand them.

00:31:02.755 --> 00:31:06.749
And we need to be very
careful that they not be made

00:31:06.749 --> 00:31:09.126
uncomfortable by the medications
that we're giving them.

00:31:09.126 --> 00:31:11.674
And finally, just because a
small amount of medication

00:31:11.674 --> 00:31:14.467
works well, doesn't mean
a lot will work better.

00:31:14.467 --> 00:31:16.989
In fact, in most cases,
reducing the dose will probably

00:31:16.989 --> 00:31:19.813
lead to a better outcome
than other things as well.

00:31:19.813 --> 00:31:21.369
So be cautious.

00:31:21.369 --> 00:31:25.238
And the bottom line is that
we want to use treatments

00:31:25.238 --> 00:31:27.939
that work, and some of the
treatments that work are really

00:31:27.939 --> 00:31:29.313
environmental treatments.

00:31:29.313 --> 00:31:32.227
And we need to help the speech
and language pathologist,

00:31:32.227 --> 00:31:35.193
the behavioral therapist do
a better job by supplementing

00:31:35.193 --> 00:31:38.851
those--management of those
behaviors with the medications.

00:31:38.851 --> 00:31:40.691
At the end of the day, we
want the kids to get better,

00:31:40.691 --> 00:31:42.751
and we should do everything
we can, bring all the tools

00:31:42.751 --> 00:31:44.752
together to get them better.

00:31:44.752 --> 00:31:45.941
And at that point, I'll stop.

00:31:45.941 --> 00:31:47.691
Thank you very much.
