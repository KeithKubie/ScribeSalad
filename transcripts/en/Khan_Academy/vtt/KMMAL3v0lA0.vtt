00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:04.880
One of the reasons that's
most cited as to a cause

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.550
or the cause of why World War
I turned into a world war,

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.490
as opposed to just a regional
conflict in southeast Europe,

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.180
is the alliance system that
was developing in the decades

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.170
leading up to World War
I. And to understand

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:20.630
that, I've distilled a bunch
of the alliances that occurred

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.549
in those decades leading
up to World War I.

00:00:22.549 --> 00:00:24.090
And this is just a
distilled version.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.780
There were many other alliances
that were tangentially related.

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:29.405
But I tried to distill down the
ones that were directly related

00:00:29.405 --> 00:00:33.070
to all of the dominoes
falling in 1914 that

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.340
led to all of Europe
being essentially at war

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.650
with each other.

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:39.780
So to understand that, we
have to rewind 75 years.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.240
So World War I starts in 1914.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:47.280
75 years before that, in 1839,
you have the Treaty of London.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.680
And the Treaty of
London did many things.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.780
But Article 7 is what's relevant
to the beginning of World War

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.450
I, where Britain
agrees to protect

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.810
the neutrality of Belgium.

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:59.930
And if you're skeptical,
you might say, hey,

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:01.660
this is a 75-year-old treaty.

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:02.980
Why does this matter anymore?

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.000
And that, actually,
would be a good question.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.600
Really, all of these
alliances-- it's

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.320
a very healthy debate
you can have as to

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.865
whether these are the
direct causes of why

00:01:10.865 --> 00:01:13.440
one of these powers
declared war on the other.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.000
Or whether these
were just excuses.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.336
These were a legal
pretext for saying,

00:01:17.336 --> 00:01:18.710
oh, I need to
declare war on you.

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.170
When in reality,
they really did want

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:21.960
to declare war for a
whole set of reasons

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.650
to keep the other
person's empire in check,

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:26.380
to flex their
military muscle, to go

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.410
after more territory
in their empires.

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.210
Who knows what it might be?

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.880
But needless to say,
1839 was the legal basis

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:39.540
for the British Empire
to protect Belgium.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.940
Now, you fast-forward 40
years, you get to 1879.

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.840
You have a newly
born German Empire

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.440
out of the Franco-Prussian
War in 1871.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.520
That newly born German empire,
they just had-- essentially,

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.370
it's an extension of
Prussia, fundamentally,

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:58.807
a German kingdom.

00:01:58.807 --> 00:02:00.140
They just had a war with France.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.700
They took some very valuable
territory from France.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.290
They're paranoid that France
wants to get back at them.

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.800
They're paranoid
about the Russians.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.540
And they have some connection
with the Austrians--

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.710
the Austro-Hungarians,
I should say.

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:19.370
And so in 1879, they sign
the Dual Alliance Treaty

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.870
between Germany
and Austria-Hungary

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.700
to protect each other
if Russia attacks.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.900
They have this common enemy
right over here, Russia.

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.770
So they are going to-- let me
do this in a different color.

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:32.870
They are going to
protect each other.

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.990
So this makes the new German
Empire feel a little bit better

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:37.930
about its position
in Europe, in case

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.380
they were to get into a war
with either of these characters.

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.900
Then in 1892--
you could imagine,

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.840
if you ever play a game
of Risk or if you ever

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.714
play the game of Diplomacy,
which is actually

00:02:47.714 --> 00:02:49.740
based on what
happened in World War

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.550
I. If you see some
people that you might be

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.265
at war with starting
to become friends,

00:02:54.265 --> 00:02:56.390
you want to look for other
friends, other alliances

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.400
that you can form in case
they declare war on you.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.030
So in 1892, you have an
alliance between the French

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.400
and the Russians, the
Franco-Russian Military

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.470
Convention.

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.080
So this is an alliance.

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.670
Let me do this in the
magenta color again.

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:16.250
You have an alliance
between France and Russia.

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.520
And then finally, in the
early 1900s, 1904 to 1907,

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.410
you have a series of agreements.

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.350
"Entente" essentially
means agreements.

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.780
Agreements between the
British Empire and France,

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.410
between the British Empire
and the Russian Empire,

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.630
to essentially get on good
terms with each other.

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.027
These weren't as
formally bonding

00:03:34.027 --> 00:03:35.860
that, hey, if someone's
going to attack you,

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:37.460
I'm going to attack them.

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:39.400
But they were, essentially,
able to resolve

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.390
a lot of their issues
on what's going on

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.850
in their other
imperial conquests.

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:46.950
And they formed what is
called the Triple Entente,

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.070
the triple agreement
between Britain,

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.580
between the British Empire--
and right here, I just

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:57.370
circled the United Kingdom--
France, and Russia.

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.070
And on the other side of that,
you had the Triple Alliance.

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.830
You have Germany.

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:02.300
You have Austria-Hungary.

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.130
And you also have Italy.

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:09.100
Now, the reason why, even though
entering into World War I,

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.570
Italy was formerly part
of the Triple Alliance.

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:14.140
And there were treaties
between Italy and Germany

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:16.209
to become part of
this Triple Alliance.

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:18.810
The reason I don't focus on
those is once the war started,

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:24.280
Italy did not go on the side
of Germany and Austria-Hungary.

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.570
It went on the
side of the Allies,

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:29.294
on the side of the
Triple Entente.

00:04:29.294 --> 00:04:30.960
But this will give
you a good background

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:36.360
for why what would seem like a
regional skirmish in southeast

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:42.457
Europe turns into a pan-Europe
and eventually pan-global war.
