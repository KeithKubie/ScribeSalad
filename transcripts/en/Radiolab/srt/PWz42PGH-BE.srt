Hello, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert
Krulwich this is radio lab, that podcast.

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:08,130
So today on the podcast we are going
to continue the conversation that we

3
00:00:08,131 --> 00:00:10,470
started in our last hour. You know,

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,460
animal minds like what can
you share with say your dog,

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,560
like really truly share, right.

6
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:20,160
In this 10 minutes we're going to explore
a kind of sharing that we didn't get

7
00:00:20,161 --> 00:00:21,150
to in our last hour.

8
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:26,330
One that's arguably a deeper kind of
sharing comes to us from reporter Ben

9
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:31,110
Calhoun and grew out of a
conversation that he had with a well,

10
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:34,430
just listen. Okay. You can start
anytime you want. All right.

11
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:38,150
Thank you very much, sir. You're ready
to go. Are you? Yeah, absolutely. Jerry,

12
00:00:38,151 --> 00:00:39,440
you ready? Yes, sir. Whenever you are,

13
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:43,760
let's just start with the having you
introduce yourself. I'm Jerry stones.

14
00:00:43,761 --> 00:00:47,930
I'm the facilities director at the Gladys
porter zoo. That's where Jerry is now,

15
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:49,670
but he told me this story.

16
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:54,740
He was working at the Henry Doorly zoo
in Nebraska and he was working with this

17
00:00:54,741 --> 00:00:56,870
orangutan named Fu Manchu.

18
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:01,940
I call him food that everybody that had
loved that old boy referred to him as

19
00:01:01,941 --> 00:01:05,300
food or fully wait, let me just set the
scene. So we're in the Nebraska Zoo.

20
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,290
We were in Nebraska. Is this in Omaha?
Oh, in Omaha. Okay. In the Omaha Zoo.

21
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:14,740
It's fall 1967 late 66 or 67 kind of coal.

22
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:17,090
The leaves have fallen off the trees.

23
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:19,910
Jerry stones is just going
about his daily business.

24
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:22,790
What is his daily business and
being in charge of the zookeepers.

25
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:26,090
So he's kind of the top dog among
the crew of zookeepers there.

26
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:30,080
And he's up at the office and then all
of a sudden here comes a couple of the

27
00:01:30,081 --> 00:01:33,980
keepers running up over this
hill is Jerry, Jerry, Jerry.

28
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:36,950
The orangutans are into trees
by the elephant building.

29
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:41,350
[inaudible]

30
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:44,290
the line went dead for a minute cause
I couldn't figure out what the blazers

31
00:01:44,291 --> 00:01:46,780
they were talking about.
And I said, wait, what?

32
00:01:46,781 --> 00:01:49,780
And they said the rangs in the
trees by the elephant building.

33
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:54,190
So the orangutans are no longer
in their assigned area. Yes.

34
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:57,730
So I took off with them and we ran down
there and sure enough there was this

35
00:01:57,731 --> 00:02:02,140
grove of elm trees on this
hill overlooking the elephant
building and an air up

36
00:02:02,141 --> 00:02:05,410
in the top of these trees were all
their Rangataua and, Oh God. Yeah.

37
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:09,940
And there was a Fu Manchu and his
female Tondo Leo and an old female named

38
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:14,140
Sophia, big heavyset girl and Toba,
young female and dentists' a young male.

39
00:02:14,141 --> 00:02:16,780
And they were all up in the trees.
Five of them. I have a, I'm up there,

40
00:02:16,781 --> 00:02:20,980
you know, look like these
huge red clumps of grapes

41
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:27,670
at this point. Jerry's a young
guy, so he went Tarzan on them.

42
00:02:27,671 --> 00:02:28,421
Back in those days,

43
00:02:28,421 --> 00:02:32,230
I didn't think anything about going
to the top of a tree and grabbing an

44
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:35,890
arranged by the hand and leading him
back out of the tree, even though I,

45
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,210
couple of them had already bit me.

46
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:42,330
So he gets them all back in the exhibit
and they didn't know how the orangutans

47
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,470
had gotten out. No question.
And everybody and not listening.

48
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:50,050
I have a tendency to do
that, you know? Anyway,

49
00:02:50,051 --> 00:02:51,220
I would get them down to the building.

50
00:02:51,221 --> 00:02:56,170
We put them away in the Cajun and we
go out to see what was going on in the

51
00:02:56,171 --> 00:03:00,650
exhibit itself. There's most on each side
of exhibit, you know, like a zoom out.

52
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:04,150
You've got the exhibit and then you've
got where people look from and in between

53
00:03:04,151 --> 00:03:07,720
there's a mode, right? Well, down at the
bottom of this moat, there was a door

54
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,810
to a furnace room,

55
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:14,770
big metal door that had just a
regular lock and everything on it.

56
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:20,050
It was always shut, kept locked
all the time that door was open.

57
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:22,840
What had happened, the rings
had climbed down in a moat,

58
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:27,100
went into the furnished room, which
was in the basement, up a ladder,

59
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:31,900
did a janitor's closet on the first
floor. One, two, three, four, five.

60
00:03:31,901 --> 00:03:35,440
They all emerged from this janitor's
closet and then just pushed the big glass

61
00:03:35,441 --> 00:03:37,360
doors open, went out into the park.

62
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:42,200
I figured somebody had not locked
the door shut. Oh right. Okay.

63
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:47,020
So Jerry stones gathers his zookeeper's
around and he says basically when we

64
00:03:47,021 --> 00:03:48,250
needed to be more careful,

65
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:50,950
somebody evidently went out
in that moat to do something.

66
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:52,210
And when they came back in,

67
00:03:52,211 --> 00:03:57,211
they did not lock the door a mistake
and it should not happen again.

68
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:02,050
And everyone at buddy bowed that this
would not happen again. And it didn't,

69
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:06,640
it didn't happen again for
about a week. A few days go by,

70
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:08,800
I can't remember where
I was at. And again,

71
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,830
the orangutans during the trees by the
elephant building and Jerry, we, we,

72
00:04:11,831 --> 00:04:14,770
the door was locked. Jerry, we didn't do
it. We didn't do it, you know, not ana.

73
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:18,520
So they take them all back into the
building. Same thing. I get there,

74
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:22,960
go down to mote. That furnace
room door is open again.

75
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,950
I was convinced that these people
were not sharp enough to shop,

76
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:30,220
tie their shoes, you know, and, and,
and uh, and they said, but Jerry,

77
00:04:30,221 --> 00:04:32,440
we don't go down there.
Well, somebody screwed up.

78
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:34,360
So I'm discussing with these capers,

79
00:04:34,361 --> 00:04:37,800
what's going to happen to them in
their short lives. Now, I swear to God,

80
00:04:37,801 --> 00:04:39,520
I said, Dude, look,
next time this happens,

81
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,960
somebody being fired few days later,

82
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,200
somebody runs up to you on Jerry, come,
you got to come see this. I'll go, no,

83
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:50,860
not now.

84
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:54,730
They ran out into the zoo and they went
to this hill that's near the exhibit,

85
00:04:55,770 --> 00:05:00,570
peaked over the top of it. Commando
style down at the bottom of the moat.

86
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:05,040
Fu Manchu was messing with that
furnace room door. What was he doing?

87
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:09,000
They couldn't exactly see what he was
doing because of how far away they work.

88
00:05:09,001 --> 00:05:14,001
But he was fiddling with the lock and
he's fiddling and he's fiddling and then

89
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:16,580
the door,

90
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:21,110
the dam is popped open and we went
bowling down the hill and we caught him

91
00:05:21,111 --> 00:05:22,340
before he could do any damage.

92
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,840
You mean the rang hands seem to be
opening the door? Yes. You know,

93
00:05:26,841 --> 00:05:29,360
I realized that it wasn't
their fault and you know,

94
00:05:29,361 --> 00:05:31,660
I hate the crow that I had to eat and uh,

95
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,820
we still didn't know exactly how I did it.

96
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:38,420
And we went out there and we looked
around and there was few little sticks and

97
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:39,890
stuff laying around. We thought, well,

98
00:05:39,891 --> 00:05:43,430
he must be using this stuff to pry the
door open or do something, you know?

99
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:48,200
So Jerry figured, easy solution, clean
the exhibit every day. I said, look,

100
00:05:48,201 --> 00:05:52,220
from now on we need to go out in this
yard everyday before we put the rangs out

101
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:55,110
and searched. That plays
over and again, you know,

102
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,820
make sure there's no sticks or anything
out there. I don't know how he did it,

103
00:05:58,821 --> 00:06:00,680
but he did it. You know,

104
00:06:00,681 --> 00:06:02,720
we knew what the problem was
and we knew how to deal with it.

105
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:07,670
Went along like that for a week or
two. And then here come to keepers,

106
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:12,950
Jerry, the orangutans are in,
into trays by the elephant, Billy.

107
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,630
And we checked it. Jerry, we did
everything we were supposed to do here.

108
00:06:15,631 --> 00:06:18,740
You know, they're, they're bound and
determined. They didn't do anything wrong.

109
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:19,490
Should we sit down?

110
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:23,630
So they had been searching this exhibit
every day and make sure that he didn't

111
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:26,600
hear was no, we walked that exhibit.
We cleaned them all, we did everything.

112
00:06:26,601 --> 00:06:29,830
There was no sticks, no anything. We
could find that he used the pride,

113
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:33,200
that darn door open. No tools, no
tools, no nothing. Wait, how do we know?

114
00:06:33,201 --> 00:06:36,080
Like how can this be? How can this be? How

115
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:40,960
can this be? So he's ushering
Fu Manchu through the building.

116
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:42,220
They've got all the orangutans,

117
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:47,310
they're moving them and all of a sudden
he sees in the corner of Fu Manchu,

118
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,710
I saw this little blink of light,

119
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:55,330
just a little glimmer of light, like
a silver filling or something. Yeah,

120
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:58,690
a little shiny thing. It's the
corner of his mouth. He walks over,

121
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:02,480
pulls down through
Manchus lip and in there,

122
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,660
low and behold there was a piece of wire,

123
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:06,663
uh,

124
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:13,390
about four inches long that he had bent
into a horseshoe to fit in inside of his

125
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:15,220
lower lip and around his gum.

126
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:19,330
And he's had it there for so long
that it was just polished, shiny,

127
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:24,420
suggesting what this animal has been
secreting his actual key all this time.

128
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,090
Yeah. All this stuff that we're
picking up and hauling away,

129
00:07:28,091 --> 00:07:32,860
it keeps him from opening the door was
of no use because he was carrying his own

130
00:07:32,861 --> 00:07:33,880
key with him all the time.

131
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:38,910
What he had done was stick the wire into
the space between the door jam and the

132
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:43,660
door, wrap it around the
latch and pull it back.

133
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:48,010
It's like the credit card trick.
You know, nobody taught him this.

134
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:53,320
Nobody ever did anything like that around
him. Not only did he make the tool,

135
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:55,870
but he put it in a place
where I couldn't find it.

136
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,410
He was smart enough to know that if I
found it, I'd take it away from him.

137
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,840
The locksmith union of the United States
gave him an honorary membership and the

138
00:08:05,841 --> 00:08:08,750
zoo in Omaha had that hanging
on their wall for years.

139
00:08:08,751 --> 00:08:09,890
I don't know if they still have it or not.

140
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:13,330
[inaudible]

141
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:16,510
well, this has been very
interesting. So really great story.

142
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:20,880
[inaudible] very nice. But I don't quite
understand like what, what exactly was,

143
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:24,460
why are you telling it to me? What is
the reason for this? Well, you know,

144
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,230
there's a lot of stuff,

145
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:28,360
stories of orangutans
using tools, right? Yeah.

146
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,850
But even though this is a funny story,

147
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:35,880
there's actually a really serious question
at the heart of it about deception.

148
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:39,900
Why? What's so important about,
well, deception is special.

149
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:45,020
It requires that the deceiver get into
the mind of the person who they're

150
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:50,541
deceiving and nobody has been able to
prove that animals can actually do this.

151
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:56,100
No. A human beings
thoughts intimately enough,

152
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:59,880
get inside their heads and you
know, consciously deceived them.

153
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:01,653
So

154
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:04,210
I took the Fu Manchu story

155
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:06,170
two

156
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:09,500
a scientist, a primatologist
named Rob Shoemaker.

157
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:10,750
Hello, Rob Shoemaker.

158
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:15,100
Hey Rob, it's been, am I catching
you at the great ape trust in Iowa?

159
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:18,990
And I studied the behavior
and cognition of Orangutans

160
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:20,340
and he says,

161
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:25,110
the food man choose story doesn't prove
that animals are capable of doing this.

162
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:30,200
It in this particular case, I
can't prove it one way or another.

163
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:33,550
There's always a question of whether
or not it was really happening,

164
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:37,470
but when I really pushed it, I'm
just wondering like personally,

165
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:41,050
do you believe in his case
that it was he said yes.

166
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,600
Do you know if, if I had to just
give, um, an opinion about this,

167
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:47,170
that deep down,

168
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:48,490
I have no doubt at all.

169
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:53,790
I 100% believe it was deception keeping
a tool concealed over a whole number of

170
00:09:56,321 --> 00:10:01,321
days and timing his escapes so
that no one was around to see him.

171
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:06,480
I think the evidence is just absolutely
compelling to suggest that he who met

172
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,160
you was able to deceive and was deceiving.

173
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:12,390
And if someone really has that
much trouble believing yet,

174
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,710
I think then maybe they add a question.

175
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,790
Is it because I don't believe what I'm
hearing or I don't want to believe it

176
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:20,770
because it's an orangutan.

177
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,190
If they don't want to believe it because
it's an orangutan, that's no excuse.

178
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:28,530
It was like who tardy? I just,

179
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:30,780
I couldn't figure it out. I mean,

180
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:35,670
when you think you're so smart that all
the other animals are way below you and

181
00:10:35,671 --> 00:10:38,610
all of a sudden you find this animal that
does these sort of things and you know

182
00:10:38,611 --> 00:10:41,630
people that couldn't open the door
with the key right there. You, you,

183
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:42,960
you know you have to be in awe.

184
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,000
[inaudible].

185
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,410
I've been around a lot of other
orangutans in my almost 45 years in this

186
00:10:50,411 --> 00:10:51,100
business,

187
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:55,430
and a next time you go to a
zoo and you're around one,

188
00:10:56,020 --> 00:11:00,610
you just look at their face and you look
at their eyes and you can see in there

189
00:11:00,611 --> 00:11:04,740
there's this, these wheels
turning, trying to figure you out.

190
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:17,500
[inaudible]

191
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,690
then Calhoun is a reporter
here in New York City.

192
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:24,040
Thank you to him and thanks to the people
who make radio lab possible. They are,

193
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,790
well, they're the national
science foundation and they
are the Sloan Foundation.

194
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,700
Yup. I'm Jad. I boom, Rod, I'm
rubber coach. Thanks for listening.
