00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:03.080
Hey,
what's going on?
It's Bill Burr.

2
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:07.850
It's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday.
Uh,

3
00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:12.500
May 28th,
May 28th,

4
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:13.670
2018 what's going on?
How,

5
00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:22.443
<v 0>whew.</v>

6
00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.630
<v 1>Oh,
sorry.
I just had to cry it out of me</v>

7
00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.760
on the motorcycle.
Oh,
Jesus.

8
00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:39.523
<v 2>Ah,</v>

9
00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.700
<v 1>if only kids knew how to play basketball these days.</v>

10
00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.930
And I'm actually talking about the Cavaliers and the Celtics.

11
00:00:47.931 --> 00:00:51.950
If we just played basketball in the end,
if we just played basketball,

12
00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.490
we actually could have,
why didn't think we'd win?
Won Two games of that series.

13
00:00:55.491 --> 00:00:59.600
I was just like the Barn James is Lebron James.
If we just fucking played,

14
00:00:59.601 --> 00:01:03.320
but I didn't see one pick and roll that whole fucking game.
Maybe I missed it.

15
00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:07.600
I mean,
I was having a couple as I was sitting there just watching it.

16
00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.940
It's game seven,
you know,
stressing out ahead.
I had to take the edge off the,

17
00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.510
you know,
I was talking to a buddy of mine.
I swear to God,

18
00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.980
if you take a fucking three pointer with nobody underneath and you miss that

19
00:01:21.981 --> 00:01:25.590
should be in the stat sheet as a turnover.
That's all.
I'm going to

20
00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:32.000
Jesus Christ.

21
00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.750
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

22
00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.830
<v 1>This is what happens when everybody in the league is a fucking one and done guy.</v>

23
00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.940
You know,
they never took a physics class or I dunno,

24
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.770
ever fucking had a ruler and fucking measured
dude.

25
00:01:46.771 --> 00:01:50.370
We would,
there was like six minutes left.
We're like down by,
I don't know,
four,

26
00:01:50.371 --> 00:01:51.870
five,
six,
seven points.

27
00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.110
We just start taking threes every time we'd go down the court,
like,

28
00:01:55.111 --> 00:01:57.090
like there was like five seconds left.

29
00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.860
Like the crowd was counting down.
I don't know.

30
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.490
Having said that,
I got to tell you right now,
Lebron James,

31
00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.830
<v 2>uh,</v>

32
00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.210
<v 1>in my mind,
leapfrog,</v>

33
00:02:09.211 --> 00:02:12.840
Cobe Bryant taking that team to the NBA finals.

34
00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:15.373
<v 2>MMM.</v>

35
00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.910
<v 1>I just,
I just think Colby would have been too far.
He just didn't have the,</v>

36
00:02:19.911 --> 00:02:22.250
he just didn't have that thing.

37
00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.980
He would just look at everybody on the bench,

38
00:02:24.981 --> 00:02:27.860
like the bumps they were and be like,
what the fuck?

39
00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.100
And would just walk into the front office and be like,

40
00:02:31.101 --> 00:02:32.630
I'm not playing with this shit.

41
00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.050
Get me better guys or I'm fucking leaving.
That's,
that's how he got his title.

42
00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.210
He was also a beast.
You know.
I'm a Celtics fan,

43
00:02:42.211 --> 00:02:44.880
so I always have to shit on them a little bit.
You know what I mean?

44
00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.650
It's either me or shack.
Um,
the Black Mamba,

45
00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.700
he's ice cold,
except when he was crying in the front office.
Jesus belt.

46
00:02:55.701 --> 00:02:59.740
Can you stay on topic?
Sorry.
This has nothing to do with Colby.
Bryan East,

47
00:02:59.741 --> 00:03:01.540
one of the greatest players of all fucking time.
All right.

48
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.520
I'm just a fucking butt hurt Celtics fan right now.
Who's team way over achieved?

49
00:03:06.521 --> 00:03:11.110
So I says I should be happy.
Um,
but Lebron James,

50
00:03:11.111 --> 00:03:15.760
what the fuck that guy did?
Jesus Christ.
Um,

51
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.920
unbelievable.
Speechless.
I don't,
I don't know what to say.

52
00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.570
And uh,
from what I've heard,
the warriors are a little banged up.

53
00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.540
Um,
they got that game seven tonight.
Uh,
so I mean,
I guess,
you know,
as,

54
00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.620
as a fan of basketball and more importantly,

55
00:03:35.621 --> 00:03:36.640
competition,

56
00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.770
I have to root for the Cavaliers or the Houston Rockets.
I mean,

57
00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:46.240
do you just,
you can't root for,
uh,

58
00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.530
a pile on team unless they're playing another pile on team.

59
00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.760
Isn't that how it works?
And admittedly,
the Celtics had one in 2008.

60
00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:55.810
I didn't watch that team the whole year.
You know,

61
00:03:55.811 --> 00:03:59.050
I watched during the playoffs and we played the Lakers and I was like,
all right,

62
00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:03.630
I'll pile on t verse your pile on t whatever.
I'll do it.

63
00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.960
Um,
but I,
congratulations.

64
00:04:06.961 --> 00:04:11.340
Congratulations to the Cleveland Cavaliers.
Lebron James.

65
00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:16.230
Without a doubt.
I mean,
you got,
I mean,
I would put that guy like,
I dunno.

66
00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.230
It's hard.
It's hard when you start talking to Oscar Robertson,
Bill Russell,
not,

67
00:04:20.231 --> 00:04:23.430
I don't know where the fuck he is,
but he's passed Koby and the modern era.

68
00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.300
I'd have to say that it's him and Jordan and a,

69
00:04:27.301 --> 00:04:31.670
I know a lot of your young kids right now who didn't watch Michael Jordan.
Uh,

70
00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:32.431
you know,

71
00:04:32.431 --> 00:04:35.440
you go back and you go on Youtube and you watch his highlights and that type of

72
00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:40.560
that guy,
he literally changed the game.
Um,

73
00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.170
I,
I can't,
I can't stress that enough.
Like the game changed.

74
00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:50.820
He didn't dominate the game the way Colby did.
He literally changed it.
Like,
oh,

75
00:04:50.821 --> 00:04:54.360
I didn't know you could fucking do that.
I had no idea you could do that.

76
00:04:54.361 --> 00:04:56.100
My only knock against Lebron James is what?

77
00:04:56.101 --> 00:04:58.620
He fucking blocked that shot and then just stood there,

78
00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:02.640
basking in his own amazing,
amazing amazingness or whatever.

79
00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.620
And then the announcer Jackson goes every once in a while.

80
00:05:05.621 --> 00:05:08.370
I said something every once in a while you make a play that's so unbelievable.

81
00:05:08.371 --> 00:05:10.050
You have to stand there and admire it.

82
00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:14.070
And I was sitting there like the oldest old man ever go in like that.

83
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.240
That yellow fucking y'all.

84
00:05:20.241 --> 00:05:23.430
I can't even believe how I can't even believe how amazing I am.

85
00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:27.820
The fuck down the court.
You know,
he can't really say to help out your teammates.

86
00:05:27.821 --> 00:05:31.180
He had a ball in his back,
but just what the fuck was he doing back there?

87
00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:36.340
Standing there for like 20 minutes like do you understand what that dumb look on

88
00:05:36.341 --> 00:05:39.010
his face?
Like he just stopped a Scud missile.

89
00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:41.890
You blocked a shot.

90
00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.940
I Dunno,
I am officially,
this is how old I am.

91
00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:50.800
Okay.

92
00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:55.800
This is how I was actually watching old school TV shows and like I turn 50 next

93
00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:59.660
month as much as it's fucking with me.

94
00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:05.170
I wouldn't change when I was born to live now as a younger person and I'm for

95
00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:07.340
the simple reason that when I was a kid,

96
00:06:07.341 --> 00:06:09.950
this is what a theme song sounded like on a TV show.

97
00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:17.270
<v 0>Sounds like a fucking porno.</v>

98
00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:29.750
<v 1>That's all people playing that come on.
Get to the fucking horns.</v>

99
00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:36.450
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

100
00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:39.160
<v 1>dude.
Nice be my what?
That you knew somebody was getting fucked up.</v>

101
00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:45.910
Knows we're all fucking people.
You know something?

102
00:06:45.911 --> 00:06:47.320
After they played that theme song,

103
00:06:47.321 --> 00:06:51.610
they didn't stand in the studio admiring what the fuck they just did.

104
00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:53.860
Other than that,
I love Lebron James.
I do.

105
00:06:53.861 --> 00:06:57.880
I'm just breaking his fucking balls and I also love the city of Cleveland and I

106
00:06:57.881 --> 00:06:59.320
even still love the city.
CLEVELAND,

107
00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:04.440
even after about five or 6,000 Cleveland Cavalier fans.

108
00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:10.210
What at me sending me fucking all kinds of shit over social media like,

109
00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:14.620
like they weren't,
they didn't have a Cleveland steamer in their fucking pants.

110
00:07:14.621 --> 00:07:18.180
Whatever the fuck.
I hate those stupid jokes,
by the way.
You know what?

111
00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:22.540
A dirty sage edges.
No,
I doubt and yet keep the job to yourself.

112
00:07:22.541 --> 00:07:23.670
It's all the same Fugate.

113
00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:27.400
When you stick your Dick in his shit and you shove it up her nose and you go,

114
00:07:27.401 --> 00:07:31.660
God bless you,
but you say it in Spanish with water,

115
00:07:31.661 --> 00:07:32.560
bubbler jokes.

116
00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:40.770
Those are all jokes for people who don't know how to make a move.
Right.

117
00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:45.140
Did you stand there?
Hey,
this one's cool.
We'll just take you.

118
00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:49.560
Can you fucking pilot?
Cool.
Um,
oh,

119
00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:53.120
that gives me do shells.
I hate,
I always fucking hated those jokes anyways.

120
00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:57.810
I like,
oh,
we used to trash Patrice when he used to do those jokes on stage.

121
00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:03.990
We still get Patricia doing street jokes.
You're doing street jokes.
Um,

122
00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:10.110
anyways,
uh,
I'm all over the fucking map here,
Simon.

123
00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:13.000
I'm shaken off a game.
Seven loss.
Um,

124
00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:17.180
I was just psyched that we got to these two conference finals and all of his

125
00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:20.160
sons like,
Holy Shit,
we could actually win this fucking thing.
Then I'm like,

126
00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:24.660
and if the warriors loose to the rockets,
who gives a fuck about the rockets?

127
00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:29.820
We always beat the rockets in the file.
We beat him in 81 and 86.
Um,

128
00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:33.240
we're going to have the TRIFECTA.
Oh,
Billy started dreaming.

129
00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:36.443
Um,
anyways,

130
00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:41.070
so was Cleveland fans who were talking all this crazy shit.

131
00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:45.660
All right.
Yeah.
You're lying to yourself if you forgot about that.

132
00:08:45.661 --> 00:08:49.110
Jason Tatum Dunk on Lebron James.
Okay.

133
00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:52.920
That right there is what's known as a changing of the guard.
Okay.

134
00:08:52.921 --> 00:08:56.760
That was like the first time Shaq having problems with his big toe.

135
00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:59.370
Like that's the beginning of the end.
Okay.

136
00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:03.210
And a new chapters coming in and it's dressed in green and white.
All right.
Seat.

137
00:09:03.211 --> 00:09:05.250
But this one fucking guy,
I trashed him on Twitter.

138
00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:10.050
He gave me some shit and he had his stupid Cavaliers Jersey,

139
00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:14.580
you know,
and has had on,
you know,
with this game seven look on his face.
I said,

140
00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:15.570
but he was wearing his seat

141
00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:16.473
<v 2>belt.</v>

142
00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:21.563
<v 1>I Dunno.</v>

143
00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:24.930
Some Cleveland plans when they look up in the rafters and they start counting

144
00:09:24.931 --> 00:09:29.820
banners,
they forget that an eastern conference championship is not an NBA title.

145
00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:36.320
Alright.
And a division title banner is,
is literally,
that's like up.

146
00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:40.440
Like that's something you give to a millennial.
Like,
all right,
you did something.

147
00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:44.250
Um,
I don't know.
Alan got like five people gave me shit.
Why am,

148
00:09:44.251 --> 00:09:48.990
why am I doing this right now?
Why am I being so childish?
Um,
Oh God,

149
00:09:48.991 --> 00:09:53.130
we were right fucking there.
We were right there.
Um,
anyways,

150
00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:57.120
and I'm not going to do that dumb shit of lagoons.
Do so and so was there.

151
00:09:57.420 --> 00:09:59.850
Your won fair and square.
Everybody gets hurt.

152
00:09:59.851 --> 00:10:03.990
Lebron's heart radio's probably all fucked up from carrying those people.

153
00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:06.180
Anyways,
congratulations.

154
00:10:06.181 --> 00:10:09.780
That really didn't sound like a congratulatory fucking 10 minutes here,

155
00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:16.110
but that's,
that's what I was trying to get to.
Congratulations to Cleveland.

156
00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:20.400
All right.
Even like eagles fan started giving me shit.
It's just like,
dude,

157
00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:25.110
you know,
I,
I you fucking serious right now.
Good Lord.

158
00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:28.920
And The Philadelphia.
When did Philly ever start talking shit about sports?

159
00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:31.050
This is what I want all of you guys to do.

160
00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:37.160
What is the championship combination to open your city county championships?

161
00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:42.960
Ours is five,
six,
eight,
17.

162
00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:48.360
Uh,
then unlocks to safe and all the rings pour out.
What happens in Philly.

163
00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:56.520
Philly is two,
two,
three,
one.

164
00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:00.510
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

165
00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:05.400
<v 1>go fuck yourselves.
You fucking green.
Cons.
You hang around long enough,</v>

166
00:11:05.401 --> 00:11:07.650
you're going to fucking win one.
That was another one.

167
00:11:07.651 --> 00:11:11.390
This guy was giving me shit on the Celtics won like 11 championships before

168
00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:14.250
there was anybody.
It's like,
all right,
well since then we won six.

169
00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:18.720
Stop talking about the Cavaliers.
Like they're an expansion team.

170
00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:21.570
They been in the league for almost 50 seasons.

171
00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:25.410
Fucking Miami each showed up in 88.
I think they've won more than the Celtics.

172
00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:30.000
Whether they went one they've been for,
they've won four.

173
00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:36.240
Um,
I dunno.
Why am I trashing cities?
I don't,
I don't want to try.

174
00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:38.730
I don't give a fuck about Philly.
I like Philly.
I like Cleveland.

175
00:11:38.731 --> 00:11:42.510
I like all of this shit.
I'm just fucking,
you know,
it still stinks that I lost.
I,

176
00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:46.920
like I said,
I wish I don't even fucking hate the Yankees anymore.

177
00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:50.520
You can't hate them.
They're all basically,
they added one free agent.

178
00:11:50.521 --> 00:11:53.160
Other than that civil team,
it's just a,

179
00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:58.230
I think I hate the Lakers the most just because I live out here,

180
00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:00.873
<v 2>you know?</v>

181
00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:02.640
<v 1>I'd say that was,
yeah,</v>

182
00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:06.660
probably just because I live out here and then Canadian fans,
but they just,

183
00:12:06.690 --> 00:12:09.930
you know,
chasing their own fucking tails so they don't even matter anymore.

184
00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:14.280
I don't know,
I guess,
I guess I'm just not mad anymore.
I mean,
I'm still mad,

185
00:12:14.281 --> 00:12:19.210
but I guess it probably is childhood issues.
Wow.
Well,

186
00:12:19.211 --> 00:12:22.990
why the fuck do I even watch sports?
All right guys.

187
00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.690
I'm going to end this podcast and I just had an epiphany.
None of this matters.

188
00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:30.310
Um,
and he wasn't fucking with you.
God dammit.
Oh God.
Oh.
Oh.

189
00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:34.310
What game seven state game.
Seven loss stinks.
It really stinks.

190
00:12:34.311 --> 00:12:38.620
Jesus fucking Christ.
Um,

191
00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:41.600
I'm not gonna lie to you.
I mean,
I,
I've,
I haven't watched the NBN so long.
I know.

192
00:12:41.601 --> 00:12:46.070
I watched the Celtics like all last season.
I watched him and,
uh,

193
00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:46.970
I just,

194
00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:51.560
I just cannot get over running down the court and just fucking stopping.

195
00:12:51.770 --> 00:12:56.090
And EFT teammates haven't even settled and just pulling up and taken to three

196
00:12:56.091 --> 00:12:58.220
and just not getting yanked out of the fucking game.

197
00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:01.820
The only thing that makes said,
okay is the other teams are doing it too.

198
00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:06.770
It's like watching this high skilled like game at the [inaudible],

199
00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:10.310
you know,
there's no place.
Everybody just met each other,
you know,

200
00:13:10.311 --> 00:13:14.420
you just fucking
out.
They're trying to burn calories.

201
00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:18.860
Um,
all right,
we'll let it go.
Okay,
I'll let it go.
I'll let it go.

202
00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:21.830
How bad ass is that fucking theme song?

203
00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:24.290
It's from the streets of San Francisco by the way.

204
00:13:24.291 --> 00:13:27.020
I've been trying to find the original one,
but I kill my best.
I can find his,

205
00:13:27.021 --> 00:13:29.390
they,
Henry Man sees man Sini version of it.

206
00:13:31.850 --> 00:13:35.490
That was the heyday
of,
uh,

207
00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:40.700
the white cop chasing the minority actors down the street and the only role that

208
00:13:40.701 --> 00:13:44.270
he was going to get that decade,
you know,
um,

209
00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:46.190
they should,

210
00:13:46.190 --> 00:13:49.550
they should go back and they should do a documentary and all those fucking guys,

211
00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:52.190
you know,
like who has the record?

212
00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:56.540
Like what black actor in the 70s had the record for the most times he did a

213
00:13:56.541 --> 00:14:00.560
scene where he was running down an alley,
being chased by the cops.
You know,

214
00:14:00.561 --> 00:14:03.170
when you get to the fence,
that's the scene I always wanted to do.

215
00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:06.540
You get to the chain link fence,
you get like,
you know,

216
00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:09.920
a couple of rungs up and then they grab you back.
You like,
Nah,

217
00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:14.330
they fucking drag you off
when you go in freckles.

218
00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:19.850
Huh?
You know,
hurry.
It's something.
Sorry man.
I just don't go nowhere.

219
00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:30.020
Um,
anyways,
congratulations.
Another congratulations.
I'm just,
I'm just being,

220
00:14:30.021 --> 00:14:34.430
this is me in a very generous,
thankful mood.
It's Memorial Day,
right?

221
00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:39.650
Thank in the troops,
the people that made the ultimate sacrifice,
you know,

222
00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:43.460
it's a bit of a drop off to thank a fucking professional basketball team after

223
00:14:43.461 --> 00:14:45.290
you thank the troops.
But uh,
you know,

224
00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:51.620
congratulations to Daniel Ricardo winning his first,
uh,
race,

225
00:14:51.621 --> 00:14:54.800
a Formula One race in Monaco.
How about that?

226
00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:57.620
That's the race I want to go to.

227
00:14:57.621 --> 00:15:01.520
And it's probably the most boring f one race cars that race is all about

228
00:15:01.521 --> 00:15:05.450
qualifying.
That's still race.
Whoever fucking wins the pole position.

229
00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:10.220
I mean,
they're racing in those little ass fucking streets.
You know what I mean?

230
00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:12.040
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

231
00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:14.150
<v 1>You know why those streets are so small over there.</v>

232
00:15:14.151 --> 00:15:17.490
It's not because the city is so old and they used to just ride a horse down and

233
00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:22.510
it's because that's a sovereign city and that's Illuminati money and they like

234
00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:26.840
the bitches skinny.
They like them young and thin.
Okay,

235
00:15:26.841 --> 00:15:28.670
so that's that stay locked the door test.

236
00:15:28.671 --> 00:15:33.290
If they can walk down the street without the hips touching either building,
uh,

237
00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:36.470
then they'll have their current wife disposed of.

238
00:15:38.190 --> 00:15:38.320
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

239
00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:40.330
<v 1>I think that's what they do.
And then they stay young.</v>

240
00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:43.480
Evidently somebody sent me this fucking thing in here.

241
00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:46.340
I think this is how they stay young.
Somebody wrote to me,

242
00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:49.840
he said for skin injections.
Your bill,

243
00:15:49.841 --> 00:15:53.800
what gives in Hollywood?
Uh,

244
00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:58.830
my girlfriend show showed me a video of an actress on Ellen talking about

245
00:15:59.650 --> 00:16:03.040
injecting for skin cells.
Imported from Korea.

246
00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:09.810
Korean circumcisions.
Sorry.
Into her face to look young.

247
00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:12.650
Get out of their bill.

248
00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:16.030
We can't have you injecting dick skin into your face for roles.

249
00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:19.930
The fuck's going on.
Um,

250
00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:22.090
what do you mean what the fuck is going on?

251
00:16:22.091 --> 00:16:26.860
We are the leaders of how to stay young out here in Hollywood.

252
00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:31.120
Okay.
What do you,
what do you think you'll Rogaine came from?

253
00:16:31.121 --> 00:16:35.230
What do you think your,
your Grecian formula is going to come from?
Huh?

254
00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:38.920
What do you think all your workouts come from?
They come from Hollywood.

255
00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:44.620
All your fad diets.
That's us.
Okay.

256
00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:48.610
We came up with all of that.
You know why?
Cause you consider always trashing us.

257
00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:53.480
You hold us to a higher standard,
okay?

258
00:16:53.481 --> 00:16:57.320
You look to us to see what the future of vanity is.

259
00:16:58.550 --> 00:17:02.980
You look to us to make it,
okay?
Okay.

260
00:17:02.981 --> 00:17:05.590
Botox started out here.
Now looking,
it's all over the country.

261
00:17:05.620 --> 00:17:08.620
You're all fucking doing it.
All these real fucking housewives.
Huh?

262
00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:13.120
Y'All made fun of us and now look at you.
You're all on steroids.

263
00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:17.590
You get in the fucking good hair plugs because people out here in Hollywood,

264
00:17:17.591 --> 00:17:22.000
you know had the decency to stick those ant legs into their fucking heads

265
00:17:23.590 --> 00:17:28.590
to let these doctors make mistakes with their own face until it becomes safe

266
00:17:28.991 --> 00:17:32.020
enough that you could sneak into some fucking back alley and get the same

267
00:17:32.021 --> 00:17:36.310
procedure done to you when you start getting your man tits.
All right sir.

268
00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:38.980
How dare you make fun of Hollywood.

269
00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:43.000
Thanks to our self involvement.

270
00:17:43.001 --> 00:17:46.570
You'll be able to wear a tank top well into your sixties you're welcome sir.

271
00:17:48.690 --> 00:17:50.540
I mean I,
who's more fucking arrogant?

272
00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:55.570
<v 2>Cleveland Cavalier fans talking shit like they own the NBA when all they ever do</v>

273
00:17:56.270 --> 00:18:01.270
is show up in the finals to be the Washington generals to whatever the fuck that

274
00:18:03.370 --> 00:18:05.900
set that one year when they won.
Um

275
00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:08.310
<v 1>Huh.</v>

276
00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:13.310
Or you regular fucking people who sit there and go in these fucking celebrities.

277
00:18:13.351 --> 00:18:18.090
They need to be taken down a peg and Yeti,
Yeti Yada fucking Yetta.

278
00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:19.660
Let me tell you something there.

279
00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:24.270
Grill master now give to their foreman grill or whatever type of fucking cookery

280
00:18:24.271 --> 00:18:26.760
you have in your goddamn kitchen.
Huh?

281
00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:32.970
With your little fucking makeover in your sad little fucking house,

282
00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:34.911
you know?

283
00:18:34.911 --> 00:18:38.960
And then you turn on the TV to see what a dream looks like and who's standing

284
00:18:38.961 --> 00:18:41.900
there?
Me and my bald fucking head.

285
00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:46.420
By the way,
I'm not gonna lie to you guys for my 50th birthday.

286
00:18:46.421 --> 00:18:50.830
I think I'm going to give myself hair plugs.
I think I've earned them.

287
00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:56.320
Okay.
I'd like to brush my teeth,
you know,

288
00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:58.360
and not stare at the sink.
Okay.

289
00:18:58.361 --> 00:19:03.361
I would like to look up and see something that I like and you know,

290
00:19:04.750 --> 00:19:09.520
I just want to live my truth,
you know,
that's all that I'm doing.

291
00:19:09.521 --> 00:19:13.840
And Hey,
you know,
if hair plugs are going to make me feel better than I say,

292
00:19:13.841 --> 00:19:15.700
I should do it.
And you know something.

293
00:19:16.210 --> 00:19:21.210
I think it's time that I gave myself permission to look sexy again.

294
00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:28.270
Um,
why in the fuck would you ever

295
00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:32.313
<v 2>like,</v>

296
00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:37.340
<v 1>I could see if you,
if you had American for skin cells,
all right.</v>

297
00:19:37.370 --> 00:19:37.910
But like,

298
00:19:37.910 --> 00:19:42.590
why would you get for skin cells imported from a country that we're really not

299
00:19:42.591 --> 00:19:46.540
getting along with?
At least not half of it.
You know,

300
00:19:46.541 --> 00:19:49.840
why don't you just get your botox from China?
It's probably where it's from.

301
00:19:49.930 --> 00:19:54.310
Right?
Said make them China's Ted.
Um,

302
00:19:54.910 --> 00:19:56.500
yeah,
people are out of their fucking nights.

303
00:19:58.250 --> 00:19:59.083
<v 2>MMM.</v>

304
00:19:59.850 --> 00:20:02.130
<v 1>I am doing my damnedest to stay in shape,</v>

305
00:20:02.131 --> 00:20:05.370
but I am going to age fucking naturally.
That's it.
You know what I mean?

306
00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.030
Other than the,
I get a varicose vein in my left leg,
you know,

307
00:20:09.810 --> 00:20:12.990
that looks like a goddamn roadmap to fucking Albuquerque.
You know,

308
00:20:12.991 --> 00:20:16.680
I might get that taken out some point.
I keep meaning to get around to it,

309
00:20:16.681 --> 00:20:21.350
but I never wear shorts,
you know,
cause I respect people,
you know,

310
00:20:21.351 --> 00:20:24.290
all these fatties out there wearing half shirts,
acting like they're brave.

311
00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:27.860
You're not,
you discussed it and everybody should point at you.

312
00:20:27.861 --> 00:20:31.580
Like we're in the invasion of the body snatchers.
Okay.
I don't care that you fat,

313
00:20:31.581 --> 00:20:34.130
but you know,
you put on put on a whole shirt.
Maybe it is a whole shirt.

314
00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:37.640
Maybe you just ate so much that now we can see your belly again.
You know,

315
00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:41.660
like you ever see a woman with big tits were and a half shirt.

316
00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:43.520
And then when you turn around and look at her,

317
00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:46.400
it goes all the way down to our ass in the back and it's like,
oh,

318
00:20:46.401 --> 00:20:49.600
that's not an APP.
She just has giant tits.
She can't help it.

319
00:20:51.610 --> 00:20:54.790
She can't help it.
It's not her fault.
Um,

320
00:20:56.770 --> 00:21:00.570
anyways,
uh,
I took my daughter,

321
00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:05.610
we went out for a walk today and we went up,
we went on a hike and,
uh,

322
00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:08.940
you know,
I was pushing this stroller the whole way up with a great workout,
man.

323
00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:10.770
You go up the fucking hills pushing a stroller,

324
00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:12.973
<v 2>you know?</v>

325
00:21:13.850 --> 00:21:17.420
<v 1>Yeah.
That's an extra 25 pounds right there.
Just pushing it out,</v>

326
00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:19.220
pushing it up the Goddamn Hill.

327
00:21:19.670 --> 00:21:23.750
I saw this guy hiking with his daughter and his son is,
it got a little older.

328
00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:27.410
I thought it was really cool.
It's like,
man,
I'd love to do that someday.
You know?

329
00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:30.440
Although his son was still wearing his pajamas,
I was just like,
come on man.

330
00:21:30.441 --> 00:21:32.840
You gotta tell him,
put his clothes on.
But then I was thinking like,
damn,

331
00:21:32.841 --> 00:21:36.130
I least my favorite pajamas and I would of caved to.
Oh,
right.
All right.

332
00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:37.673
All right.
Son.

333
00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:40.353
<v 2>No,

334
00:21:41.690 --> 00:21:43.740
<v 1>and I'd be like,
all right,
well you wear them in the house.</v>

335
00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:45.520
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

336
00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:49.030
<v 5>but I,
oh whoa.
Where am I?
Right then we're not going hiking.
Ah,</v>

337
00:21:50.650 --> 00:21:55.310
<v 1>you well join the club son joined the club.</v>

338
00:21:57.650 --> 00:22:01.670
Um,
I,
I really don't even know what the Fuck I've been talking about.

339
00:22:01.671 --> 00:22:04.940
I'm just trying to fill up time here.
That's all I do here on this podcast.

340
00:22:04.941 --> 00:22:08.580
If you new to it,
I'll tell you right now,

341
00:22:08.610 --> 00:22:12.000
I've never been so offended in my life that someone actually has the audacity to

342
00:22:12.001 --> 00:22:15.300
make fun of the vanity of Hollywood and the Boston Celtics.

343
00:22:16.030 --> 00:22:16.863
<v 2>Okay.</v>

344
00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:20.970
<v 1>From two of the most simple combination championship combination cities ever.</v>

345
00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:22.740
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

346
00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:27.270
<v 1>What does Cleveland,
Cleveland is zero.
The Indians.</v>

347
00:22:27.450 --> 00:22:30.950
One in 48.
I'll throw another one in there.
Let me,
they fuck up one that's like,

348
00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:33.300
they're like zero one,

349
00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:35.553
<v 2>You know</v>

350
00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:37.860
<v 1>when it comes to championships,</v>

351
00:22:37.861 --> 00:22:40.980
I swear to God there should be a Fisher price tag hanging off the ones in

352
00:22:40.981 --> 00:22:45.710
Cleveland.
I'm saying your children,
when it comes to success.
Oh,
pill.
What?

353
00:22:45.730 --> 00:22:49.800
Why would she go back into that bucket of hate?
Because it's good.
It's finally,

354
00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:52.140
I must use the line from bread,
Dawn.
It keeps me warm.

355
00:22:52.890 --> 00:22:56.040
All that hates going to burn you up.
Keeps me warm.
Powers booth.

356
00:22:56.070 --> 00:22:58.580
Was it powers but was power powers booth in Atlanta?

357
00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:01.500
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

358
00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:05.530
<v 1>Um,

All right,</v>

359
00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:09.160
you guys see Morgan Freeman gotten a little bit of trouble this week.
I,
you know,

360
00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:14.140
nobody said how fucking cool it is than an 80 year old guy could still fuck.

361
00:23:14.170 --> 00:23:16.640
You know what I mean?
I mean that,

362
00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:21.090

364
00:23:23.570 --> 00:23:24.403
<v 2>I mean,</v>

365
00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:28.860
<v 1>you stopped listening to music a couple of years after high school.</v>

366
00:23:28.861 --> 00:23:31.040
You get married,
you have a kid,
you don't know what the fuck's going on.

367
00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:32.910
This guy doesn't know what's going away.
What are you gonna do next?

368
00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:37.200
Make Fun of the playlist on his flip phone.
He said his fucking eighties.

369
00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:39.850
<v 2>Okay.</v>

370
00:23:39.850 --> 00:23:41.860
<v 1>Oh my God.
I was so afraid.</v>

371
00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:45.560
I was so afraid when that guy pushing hundred,

372
00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:50.150
<v 6>that clip where he was saying,
I wish I was there.</v>

373
00:23:50.151 --> 00:23:54.080
I thought he was making fun of Michael Caine going,

374
00:23:54.081 --> 00:23:56.600
I wish I was there when you stuck your foot in your mouth saying are you

375
00:23:56.601 --> 00:23:59.930
pregnant?
And the woman wasn't.
That's how I took it.
I have no idea,

376
00:24:00.010 --> 00:24:01.160
but what would I know?

377
00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:06.800
What would I know about male and female relationships?
Okay,

378
00:24:06.801 --> 00:24:10.460
what the fuck would I know?
What was I looking up again?
Okay.
CLEVELAND,

379
00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:12.950
the Cleveland Indians.

380
00:24:12.951 --> 00:24:17.120
This is such a country thing to do after they just had success to talk about

381
00:24:17.121 --> 00:24:18.980
their entire pastures,
but this is all I got.

382
00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:21.290
This is you should listen to me is a sad,

383
00:24:21.291 --> 00:24:25.430
pathetic man taking swings at people who are no longer in the room.

384
00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:30.320
They've moved on Cleveland Indians.
I want to,
I want to coin them.

385
00:24:30.321 --> 00:24:34.520
What is it?
What is your,
your combination what?
Cleveland Indians,

386
00:24:34.521 --> 00:24:39.521
world series champion chips and I put it plural out of respect.

387
00:24:42.890 --> 00:24:47.360
World series titles too.
So they got two world series,

388
00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:52.600
one NBA zero Superbowls and we'll give them the fucking Columbus blue jackets

389
00:24:52.641 --> 00:24:54.170
with zero Stanley cups.

390
00:24:54.171 --> 00:24:59.171
So the combination to Cleveland is zero zero one two.

391
00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:06.600
All right.
Do you understand we've one more super bowls than you have.

392
00:25:06.601 --> 00:25:09.130
Why am I doing this?
This is so checked cause it's fun.

393
00:25:09.910 --> 00:25:11.110
I'm not doing it to all Cleveland.

394
00:25:11.111 --> 00:25:14.410
I'm just doing it to the fucking how do you only went to Superbowl?

395
00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:17.410
I mean two world series and you have like 58 retired numbers.

396
00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:19.770
What'd you retire the numbers from it for?

397
00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:23.410
If I have enough fucking jumping on the grenade and joining that franchise.

398
00:25:24.670 --> 00:25:26.650
Oh Bell.
I like the Cleveland Indians.

399
00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:31.270
You don't really as I kind of just had a great weekend and I don't really have

400
00:25:31.271 --> 00:25:35.390
anything to talk about.
Uh Oh by the way,
did anybody see the highlight?
I,

401
00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:41.710
I,
I dunno what I did.
I tried to favorite the thing on,
on,
uh,
my Instagram page,

402
00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:46.430
which by the way,
I suck at it.
Like I'm not making these stupid videos going.

403
00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:49.240
Like,
man,
it'd be the groceries tool to fucks up with cantaloupe.

404
00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:53.210
Check me out at the San Jose Improv.
Um,

405
00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:59.320
did you see that fucking Guy Moto GP race without that fucking guy?

406
00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:02.710
I can't even describe what he,
basically,
he's thick.

407
00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:06.070
They're all coming around the corner.
They're about two inches from each other.

408
00:26:06.071 --> 00:26:10.360
One guy wipes out
okay.

409
00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:13.720
And his bike lands perpendicular to the guy behind him.

410
00:26:16.050 --> 00:26:16.883
All right.

411
00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:22.680
And the guy just hits the gas and drives up over it like a fucking stuck man.

412
00:26:25.970 --> 00:26:27.680
He's going a 100 something miles an hour.

413
00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:32.980
He goes flying through the fucking air and then lands on gravel and somehow

414
00:26:33.411 --> 00:26:37.190
saves it and doesn't go down and continues on.
Oh.
And by the way,

415
00:26:37.191 --> 00:26:40.940
like his airbag pot and if you ever seen those guys when they get off,

416
00:26:40.941 --> 00:26:43.650
the bikes were after they wipe out their arms looking weird,

417
00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:45.810
like then like they were in these weird,

418
00:26:45.850 --> 00:26:48.340
you know when somebody gets knocked out in their arms,
kind of go doing,

419
00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:50.300
they kind of stick out.
They do that a little bit.

420
00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:53.250
I'm guessing that's because the airbag popped in.

421
00:26:53.251 --> 00:26:56.070
They can't bring their arms back down.
This guy's airbag popped,

422
00:26:56.400 --> 00:27:00.110
making them less aerodynamic.
He continued to ride the f the race.
I mean,

423
00:27:00.210 --> 00:27:04.110
it's just fucking bad ass bad ass.
You know what I miss?

424
00:27:04.111 --> 00:27:08.800
I miss the fucking Indy 500 after interviewing Danica Patrick.
Um,

425
00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:12.510
who by the way,
it was so fucking bad ass.
And um,

426
00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:17.040
I think it's really cool that she's retiring,
you know,

427
00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:21.660
retire while you still have some years left,
you know,
it doesn't look,

428
00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:26.250
uh,
you know,
you don't want to limp out of the league.
Like fucking,
you know,

429
00:27:26.251 --> 00:27:29.070
Brett Farve,
you know,
I don't really think of those last few years,

430
00:27:29.071 --> 00:27:31.840
but it's just like,
dude,
you're in there,
you're a hall of fame.

431
00:27:31.841 --> 00:27:35.250
You one of the greatest ever.
What are you doing?
Um,

432
00:27:36.510 --> 00:27:39.240
you want to get out before then?
Um,

433
00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:42.560
and then she'll say like a vineyard or something like that.
It's really a,

434
00:27:43.410 --> 00:27:47.280
that's the way to do it.
That's the way to get out of show business.
You know,

435
00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:49.470
I think the smothers brothers did that.

436
00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:53.300
Like they didn't even announced their retirement.
They,
from what I heard,

437
00:27:53.301 --> 00:27:57.020
I was working in Vegas.
They did their last show at the Orleans casino.

438
00:27:57.410 --> 00:28:01.040
Didn't say it was the last show.
Just said thank you,
good night and just fucking

439
00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:07.230
wet.
Retired to their vineyard.
How fucking bad.
I mean that is,
that's,

440
00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:08.183
that's it.

441
00:28:10.610 --> 00:28:12.920
Like with Jordan hit that last shot as a bull.

442
00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:16.670
Smothers brothers didn't come back to play for the fucking wizards.

443
00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:20.053
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

444
00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:25.220
<v 6>Um,
all right,
so Celtics lost that game seven.</v>

445
00:28:25.221 --> 00:28:27.110
And I am in the last days of my forties.

446
00:28:27.111 --> 00:28:31.640
I am basically sitting here with a bottle of tampons and some Kleenex.
This,

447
00:28:31.641 --> 00:28:36.260
this is,
this is the end of it,
man.
You know,
I mean,
Jesus,

448
00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:39.500
I look really good for fucking 50 I'm not going to lie,

449
00:28:39.530 --> 00:28:43.280
but I'm going to tell you right now,
nobody looks good at 60.
Okay?

450
00:28:43.281 --> 00:28:48.281
I don't give a fuck what you do when you're 60 you're 60 and all even,

451
00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:53.390
and that's not true.
Kenny Aronoff did my podcast.
He looked fucking unbelievable.

452
00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:58.370
And he was a little north of 60.
All right,

453
00:28:59.450 --> 00:29:03.500
that's it,
Katie era.
Kenny aronoffs.
Now the guy I'm looking at,
all right,

454
00:29:03.530 --> 00:29:06.730

whatever fucking year that is,
I'm gonna be like God.

455
00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:10.490
And that's officially you fucking oath,
right?

456
00:29:11.270 --> 00:29:15.410
There you go.
Um,

wine country trip.
Thought I'd give you some ideas.

557
00:35:29.850 --> 00:35:34.850
I grow grapes and make wine for a small producer in Sonoma county and I've been

558
00:35:35.551 --> 00:35:39.930

make his teeth white again after all that Murlow

563
00:35:59.310 --> 00:36:03.720
um,
I am not drinking Marlo.
I guess that fucked up the whole Merlow industry.

564
00:36:03.721 --> 00:36:08.280
I like Marillo.
Um,
first of all,

565
00:36:08.310 --> 00:36:12.000
don't do Napa.
It's Douchey is fuck.

566
00:36:13.410 --> 00:36:14.243
Honestly,

567
00:36:14.250 --> 00:36:18.930
you only need to drive a couple hours into Santa wine as valley for an Austin

568
00:36:18.931 --> 00:36:23.310
weekend of wine tasting.
They have all kinds of great wines there,

569
00:36:23.550 --> 00:36:27.990
but if you guys do want to come all the way up to the quote real wine country,

570
00:36:28.020 --> 00:36:32.490
I really do think Sonoma county is better than Knapek Napa County.

571
00:36:32.730 --> 00:36:36.900
The mistake people make is going to the actual town of Sonoma,

572
00:36:37.230 --> 00:36:39.930
which is boring and pretty shitty.
Uh,

573
00:36:39.931 --> 00:36:44.550
the move is to stay in Hell's stowed.
You're hooking me up Helzberg,

574
00:36:44.551 --> 00:36:47.520
which is in northern Sonoma county,

575
00:36:48.490 --> 00:36:52.440
shitloads of excellent tasting rooms and restaurants just walking around town

576
00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:55.650
plus tons of other wineries nearby to drive

577
00:36:57.150 --> 00:37:01.130
to slash hire a car.
Napa is only an hour away at most.

578
00:37:01.131 --> 00:37:03.120
So you could always cruise over there for a day.

579
00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:07.590
If there are some specific Napa wineries you want to check out,
if okay,

580
00:37:07.591 --> 00:37:09.900
if there's some specific ones you want to check out,
but seriously,

581
00:37:10.710 --> 00:37:13.800
Fuck Napa blown up way over price wide,
most of them,

582
00:37:13.801 --> 00:37:17.580
which aren't great and they can't even grow Pinot noir over there.

583
00:37:17.610 --> 00:37:20.550
It's too hot and peanut is the best wine there is.

584
00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.910
Once you learn to notice and appreciate the little details.

585
00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:27.690
Bonus fact Les Claypool has a winery here.

586
00:37:27.870 --> 00:37:32.400
He makes peanut because he knows what's up.
I fucking love Les Claypool

587
00:37:34.490 --> 00:37:38.130
shaped baby.
Do you want to fucking drink wine with me?
Um,
other football leagues.

588
00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:39.210
Well thank you sir.

589
00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:43.020
I'm going to fucking copy and paste that and send that to my class and see what

590
00:37:43.021 --> 00:37:46.470
she says.
Or other football leagues.

591
00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:52.060
Hey William Shit.
Just one.
Oh,
you know what?

592
00:37:52.061 --> 00:37:54.400
I missed the Liverpool Cup final.

593
00:37:55.780 --> 00:37:58.120
I'll have to catch their next game next season.

594
00:37:58.121 --> 00:38:02.500
Evidently I don't even know who won.
I would think uh,

595
00:38:02.530 --> 00:38:07.240
Liverpool one I lost because I didn't get any fucking,
hey dude,

596
00:38:07.241 --> 00:38:12.241
I hope you watched your adopted team one Liverpool Cup final.

597
00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:17.530
Uh,
Geez against Madrid.
Where the fuck is it over here?

598
00:38:18.250 --> 00:38:21.490
Why is my cable so slow now?
Cable my Internet.

599
00:38:23.140 --> 00:38:27.190
Come on.
You fuck hoes?
Come on.
Come on.

600
00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:31.630
Why?
Well,
I don't fucking know.
Well you don't.

601
00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:34.450
Evidently my computer is allergic to soccer.

602
00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:39.940
Uh,
okay.
Other football leagues.

603
00:38:39.941 --> 00:38:44.350
Hey William shivers was wondering since Johnny Manzel has made the switch,

604
00:38:44.351 --> 00:38:47.320
if you ever watch any CFL,
I love the CFL.

605
00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:50.560
CFL is so fucking underrated.

606
00:38:50.830 --> 00:38:53.890
CFL is better than college football.
That's a bunch of college.

607
00:38:53.891 --> 00:38:56.530
All stars that weren't quite good enough to make it to the NFL.

608
00:38:56.680 --> 00:39:00.820
But what have any college football team,
bigger field.

609
00:39:01.150 --> 00:39:03.130
It's exciting.
I don't even know what the fuck's going on.

610
00:39:03.131 --> 00:39:05.500
And there's only like six teams,
right?

611
00:39:07.150 --> 00:39:10.960
The Edmonton Eskimos.
They like your Washington Redskins,
right?

612
00:39:10.990 --> 00:39:14.680
Are they getting pressure to change that name?
The Calgary rough riders.

613
00:39:16.780 --> 00:39:19.930
The BCA Eagles on,
it's a Calgary stampede,
right?
Isn't it

614
00:39:22.290 --> 00:39:25.790
the Winnipeg nostrils stickers,
something like that.

615
00:39:25.950 --> 00:39:29.260
Something about the cold weather out there.
I don't fucking know.
Um,
oh,

616
00:39:29.261 --> 00:39:33.130
by the way,
tonight's the first night of the Stanley Cup finals,

617
00:39:34.270 --> 00:39:37.840
right?
Stanley Cup final,
not the NBA finals.
Stanley Cup.

618
00:39:37.841 --> 00:39:42.841
Final and congratulations to the fucking Vegas nights and the Washington

619
00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:47.460
capitals.
That's going to be exciting to see the team win.
But a,

620
00:39:47.470 --> 00:39:49.840
I'm really pulling for the capitals.
I'm a big,

621
00:39:50.830 --> 00:39:55.170
I'm a big fan of a fucking,
what's his face say?
Oh,
Vegan.

622
00:39:56.470 --> 00:40:00.950
You know,
Russian players get a bad name in the NHL.
Uh,
cause uh,

623
00:40:01.170 --> 00:40:04.660
I guess a number of them could give a fuck about winning a Stanley Cup.
You know,

624
00:40:04.820 --> 00:40:07.120
who is that guy that signed,
you know,
was fucking amazing.

625
00:40:07.390 --> 00:40:08.980
Played for the Atlanta thrashers,

626
00:40:08.981 --> 00:40:11.800
got a giant contract with New Jersey was just like,
yeah,
you know,

627
00:40:11.801 --> 00:40:16.080
I just don't give a fuck.
And he left,
went back to play hockey and uh,

628
00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:17.500
Russia like the Stanley Cup does,

629
00:40:17.730 --> 00:40:21.640
like that's the stereotype that it doesn't mean shit to these guys.
All right.

630
00:40:21.970 --> 00:40:26.190
So guys,
like,
you know,
Malkan in Ovechkin got a bear.
The,
the,

631
00:40:26.610 --> 00:40:29.920
the carry a load of these other Russian cuts that I guess didn't give a shit.

632
00:40:29.950 --> 00:40:33.400
So I'm rooting for that guy.
You know,

633
00:40:33.430 --> 00:40:35.470
Trump probably wouldn't like it that I'm rooting for a Russian,

634
00:40:35.471 --> 00:40:39.460
but I want to see him.
Uh,
I want to see him when one,
um,

635
00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:43.180
we should,
we shall see.
But what's his face?
Uh,

636
00:40:45.970 --> 00:40:47.320
Vince Neil Motley Crue,
one of my favorite groups of all time.

637
00:40:47.321 --> 00:40:50.710
He's out in Vegas and he's become a big fucking Vegas Knights Fan.

638
00:40:51.430 --> 00:40:54.760
So no matter what,
I'm going to be happy whoever wins.
Um,
anyways,

639
00:40:54.790 --> 00:40:57.400
other football leagues,
uh,

640
00:40:57.401 --> 00:41:00.950
I would absolutely watch the CFL are the biggest differences.

641
00:41:01.150 --> 00:41:02.350
Our field is longer,

642
00:41:02.410 --> 00:41:07.410
long and wider with bigger end zones in field goal posts are on the goal line.

643
00:41:09.070 --> 00:41:11.110
Uh,
we also function on a three down system.

644
00:41:11.490 --> 00:41:13.510
I'm probably a poor source for the rules,
but hey,

645
00:41:13.511 --> 00:41:16.960
I'm just some jackass right into the podcast.
Well,
let me know when it starts.
Ps,

646
00:41:17.230 --> 00:41:20.140
you should see a Saskatchewan rough riders game.

647
00:41:20.380 --> 00:41:25.380
We are considered one of the best football fan bases around and do a show in

648
00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:30.340
Saskatoon too.
While you're at it,
go fuck yourself and have a lovely day.
I did.

649
00:41:30.341 --> 00:41:33.430
I did a show.
That's how I know you guys go.
Ooh,

650
00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:36.440
I did a show in Saskatoon,
Saskatchewan.

651
00:41:37.490 --> 00:41:42.410
I do want in Saskatoon and Regina,
the steady that rhymes with fun.

652
00:41:42.470 --> 00:41:46.670
I never need to hear that again.
Um,
I'll definitely be back.

653
00:41:46.671 --> 00:41:48.170
It's fucking God's country up there.

654
00:41:48.260 --> 00:41:51.160
And you can see the northern lights like all your run.
Uh,

655
00:41:51.190 --> 00:41:54.920
boyfriend found out I cheated on my ex husband.
Oh boy.

656
00:41:56.720 --> 00:42:00.950
Uh,
Billy Babushka Lips.
What the fuck is Babushka I gotta look that up.

657
00:42:03.730 --> 00:42:04.563
<v 2>MMM.</v>

658
00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:11.210
<v 6>Liverpool quest for glory ends in tears as Gareth Bale.</v>

659
00:42:12.370 --> 00:42:16.700
Wonderful breaks hard.
Oh No.
Well,

660
00:42:16.701 --> 00:42:18.920
I had enough sports pain for the fucking weekend.

661
00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:21.030
<v 2>What happened?</v>

662
00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:26.420
<v 4>Okay,</v>

663
00:42:26.420 --> 00:42:28.280
<v 6>I'm clicking on the link.</v>

664
00:42:29.870 --> 00:42:33.780
Why won't you do anything?
All right.

665
00:42:34.310 --> 00:42:35.570
What was I looking at?
Babushka

666
00:42:37.940 --> 00:42:38.740
<v 4>yeah,</v>

667
00:42:38.740 --> 00:42:41.110
<v 6>it's one of my favorite words of all time.
I don't even know what it means.</v>

668
00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:44.733
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

669
00:42:45.230 --> 00:42:48.680
<v 6>Oh,
Billy Babushka.
If I was a wrestling manager,</v>

670
00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:53.900
that would be my name.
All right.
Should I end my relationship?
Uh,

671
00:42:54.290 --> 00:42:57.350
my boyfriend of a year and a half fun on,
I cheated on my ex husband.

672
00:42:57.590 --> 00:42:59.360
He's not being a huge dick about it.

673
00:42:59.361 --> 00:43:03.080
Just passive aggressive whenever shit goes down,
which is not too often.

674
00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:06.290
He's a little bit these,
a little on the sensitive side,

675
00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:10.400
but until he found out about my past,
that's what I liked about him.

676
00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:15.290
He's a math computer guy,
not an Alpha male.
Uh,
well,
you know,

677
00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:16.700
you get what you pay for sweetheart.

678
00:43:17.030 --> 00:43:20.840
He does not care what people think about him and he has a unique sense of humor.

679
00:43:21.170 --> 00:43:23.780
His family definitely has mental issues.

680
00:43:24.140 --> 00:43:29.120
His Dad refused to stay on dialysis and died when he was in high school and two

681
00:43:29.121 --> 00:43:34.121
older brothers off themselves when he was a sophomore and a senior in college.

682
00:43:35.690 --> 00:43:40.220
Jesus fucking Christ date and the Hemingways here.
I'm in my,

683
00:43:40.370 --> 00:43:45.370
my mid thirties and have a good job and he's two years older and has a great

684
00:43:45.381 --> 00:43:49.580
job,
owns a house in a good neighborhood.
No kids involved.

685
00:43:49.581 --> 00:43:51.590
Our relationship is the best I've ever had.

686
00:43:52.220 --> 00:43:54.740
I feel a lot of love recently though,

687
00:43:54.741 --> 00:43:58.250
after he found out I sense a lapse.

688
00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:02.750
He never wants to talk about it.
I could never imagine myself cheating again.

689
00:44:03.110 --> 00:44:05.930
I got married to my ex too young,

690
00:44:06.170 --> 00:44:10.400
but now that my baby making years are coming to an end,
I don't know what to do.

691
00:44:10.401 --> 00:44:15.401
Should I stick around to see if we get back to where we were or move on?

692
00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:18.590
Go drink yourself.
Um,

693
00:44:20.690 --> 00:44:21.440
<v 2>yeah.</v>

694
00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:23.720
<v 6>Yeah.
I don't,
fuck I,
you know,
I don't know.</v>

695
00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:26.910
<v 2>I don't know.
Um,</v>

696
00:44:30.900 --> 00:44:32.120
<v 6>just be like,
look,
I I</v>

697
00:44:32.140 --> 00:44:33.950
<v 4>ever going to be able to get,
just ask them,</v>

698
00:44:34.010 --> 00:44:35.670
are you going to be able to get past this?

699
00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:39.960
<v 6>You know,
here's the thing.
You know,</v>

700
00:44:42.310 --> 00:44:44.320
you did do it so

701
00:44:46.190 --> 00:44:49.700
it gives you shit.
I kind of got to roll with it.

702
00:44:49.701 --> 00:44:52.400
I guess I have gives a fuck.
Yeah.

703
00:44:52.510 --> 00:44:55.790
I just rolled with it for a little bit and just see a full fucking sensitive,

704
00:44:56.630 --> 00:45:00.620
sensitive.
Are there?
Um,
I don't know.
People always say that,
you know,

705
00:45:00.621 --> 00:45:03.110
if you fucking cheat,
you're going to cheat again.
I,
and I don't know,

706
00:45:03.190 --> 00:45:05.900
but it all depends on where you are in your life.
Who the fuck you with?

707
00:45:07.260 --> 00:45:11.600
I don't know about that one.
Is there been a study on that?
I have no idea.

708
00:45:12.620 --> 00:45:16.550
I honestly don't know what to tell you,
man.
Um,

709
00:45:19.790 --> 00:45:24.260
maybe you could turn it into some sort of math joke.
Uh,
dating older women.

710
00:45:24.290 --> 00:45:26.510
Dear Billy blue balls.
My name is prince.

711
00:45:26.511 --> 00:45:31.511
I am 23 and about to be 24 m and about a month I am in a relationship with a 44

712
00:45:32.511 --> 00:45:35.930
year old woman.
Yeah.
This is easy to get the fuck out of it.

713
00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:40.900
You're not in a relationship.
You're bang in a 44 year old woman.
Uh,

714
00:45:40.970 --> 00:45:45.800
now I know what you are thinking.
Mommy issues much.

715
00:45:46.250 --> 00:45:46.251
No.

716
00:45:46.251 --> 00:45:51.251
And I don't end fucking sentences with the word much not as I just said.

717
00:45:51.291 --> 00:45:55.400
Hey,
that's too much
that there's some fucking,

718
00:45:56.520 --> 00:46:00.500
I hate that.
Something something much.
You know what else you want?
I hate,
uh,

719
00:46:00.980 --> 00:46:05.270
so and so,
and then at something in quotes me something in quotes in the year.

720
00:46:05.271 --> 00:46:09.840
Always the coolest fucking person.
Ah,
Bill,
you're old.

721
00:46:09.930 --> 00:46:12.430
Get over it.
People talk differently now.
All right.

722
00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:14.880
You remember when you were young and everybody would yell?
Not,

723
00:46:17.070 --> 00:46:19.290
you didn't think that was annoying to older people.
All right,

724
00:46:19.291 --> 00:46:22.890
you got me now I know what you were thinking.
Okay,

725
00:46:22.891 --> 00:46:25.440
now I know what you're thinking.
Mommy issues much yet.

726
00:46:25.441 --> 00:46:29.520
That is part of the reason I am with her,
if I'm being honest.
Well,
there you go.

727
00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:30.793
Gotta love honesty.

728
00:46:31.010 --> 00:46:34.230
We have been dating for about five months now and things are good,

729
00:46:34.231 --> 00:46:36.750
but there are things that irritate the hell out of me.
What?

730
00:46:36.751 --> 00:46:39.510
Her fucking silver pubic hair.
Uh,

731
00:46:39.540 --> 00:46:43.170
like she thinks some of my views on life and other things are odd.

732
00:46:43.171 --> 00:46:46.590
I honestly think it's because she grew up in a totally different times.
Yeah.

733
00:46:46.591 --> 00:46:48.330
It's called a generation gap.

734
00:46:48.710 --> 00:46:53.130
If he gets your face out of her gap and look at the fucking calendar,
sorry.

735
00:46:54.660 --> 00:46:58.930
MMM.
We had been dating for about five months now and things are good.
No,

736
00:46:58.931 --> 00:47:02.140
they're not.
But there are things that irritate.
Okay,
I read this.

737
00:47:02.141 --> 00:47:05.560
They're not good,
sir.
You need to get the fuck out of this.
This is not gonna end.

738
00:47:05.561 --> 00:47:08.720
Well,
at some point you're going to want to have a kid.
All right?

739
00:47:09.740 --> 00:47:13.670
And a vagina is going to be in a fucking museum.
Um,

740
00:47:15.620 --> 00:47:18.020
anyways,
uh,

741
00:47:19.350 --> 00:47:22.220
where the fuck was something that definitely different time than me,

742
00:47:22.221 --> 00:47:26.510
but some of it is that she isn't into science.

743
00:47:28.230 --> 00:47:30.130
Oh,
she better be if going to try to keep herself

744
00:47:30.130 --> 00:47:30.940
<v 1>young.</v>

745
00:47:30.940 --> 00:47:35.380
Like we got into an argument about high fructose corn syrup because she said

746
00:47:35.381 --> 00:47:40.060
it's only sugar until I proved to her that it's not just sugar and she thinks

747
00:47:40.150 --> 00:47:44.700
that's not really science.
Yeah.
I thought you were into science.

748
00:47:44.701 --> 00:47:47.910
You're just reading facts that scientists figured out that's not science.

749
00:47:49.930 --> 00:47:52.790
Right.
I mean,
I could,
I mean,
the fact that I could look that up and just go,

750
00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:57.060
here it is.
That's not scientist.
If I can figure it out,
it's not science,
sir.

751
00:47:58.170 --> 00:48:02.100
Um,
and she thinks my fear of chemicals in our food is odd as well.

752
00:48:02.101 --> 00:48:07.101
It's hard being with someone that doesn't get me another thing in a nother thing

753
00:48:09.661 --> 00:48:13.800
in a black male.
Oh,
I'm a black male and she's a white female,

754
00:48:14.010 --> 00:48:17.550
so she doesn't really understand how it is to be a black man in this day and
age.

755
00:48:17.551 --> 00:48:22.080
Jesus fucking Christ,
sir.
How many red flags that you need?

756
00:48:25.090 --> 00:48:27.550
You know,
and,
and she's,
uh,

757
00:48:27.670 --> 00:48:30.550
she got fired from the Police Department for dropping the n word.

758
00:48:30.850 --> 00:48:35.260
Other than that,
I think I really like her.
Sarah,
what the fuck are you doing?

759
00:48:36.250 --> 00:48:40.180
I'm going to keep going here and to jump taught,
uh,
ended jump topic.
Uh,

760
00:48:40.210 --> 00:48:41.500
sex with her is good,

761
00:48:41.501 --> 00:48:45.460
but it's like we only have sex once and it sucks.

762
00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:50.050
She says it's because I leave her too,
so,
okay.
I'm not,

763
00:48:50.230 --> 00:48:53.470
I leave her to soar as you know.

764
00:48:53.500 --> 00:48:57.530
Is there anything worse than a big fucking Dick?
Nincompoop I can't fucking,

765
00:48:57.550 --> 00:48:59.320
I know at 1:00 AM 1:00 AM I supposed to do with you sir?

766
00:48:59.350 --> 00:49:02.680
You and your porno cockney to fucking date somebody,

767
00:49:04.420 --> 00:49:05.710
uh,
you know,
from,
from,

768
00:49:07.060 --> 00:49:08.350
<v 2>she's almost twice your age</v>

769
00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:13.130
<v 1>and she listens to country,
but this is such a fucked up email.</v>

770
00:49:13.131 --> 00:49:15.920
I don't believe it.
I'm calling bullshit on that one.

771
00:49:16.020 --> 00:49:16.853
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

772
00:49:17.620 --> 00:49:21.170
<v 1>you kind of did a slow roll on me.
You had me,
you had me,
you had me.</v>

773
00:49:21.171 --> 00:49:25.520
And then you said I'm black and I got a big deck and she,
so I don't believe it.

774
00:49:26.930 --> 00:49:27.763
<v 2>I don't believe it.</v>

775
00:49:29.060 --> 00:49:32.150
<v 1>Maybe it's true.
He goes,
I want to have excitement and shit in our relationship.</v>

776
00:49:33.080 --> 00:49:34.970
And she just doesn't bring that to the table.

777
00:49:34.971 --> 00:49:37.610
I like her a lot and we watched documentaries together.

778
00:49:37.611 --> 00:49:40.430
I'm sure that she fall asleep halfway through it like I do.

779
00:49:43.700 --> 00:49:47.330
Um,
anyways.
All right.

780
00:49:52.630 --> 00:49:57.520
Okay.
And she has a venereal disease,
but you know,

781
00:49:57.521 --> 00:50:02.020
other than that,
you know,
we laugh a lot.
Ah,

782
00:50:02.050 --> 00:50:04.990
fuck.
All right.
Do we have anything else here?

783
00:50:06.220 --> 00:50:09.910
Is there anything else that that needs to be discussed other than why is my

784
00:50:09.911 --> 00:50:11.680
computer that I got kicked off line?

785
00:50:15.260 --> 00:50:16.093
You know,

786
00:50:16.220 --> 00:50:20.090
and now it'd be funny if I never go to the Internet again in the last thing I

787
00:50:20.091 --> 00:50:25.060
did was I looked up Babushka
um,

788
00:50:25.390 --> 00:50:29.460
all right.
People,
it's Memorial Day.
Who's kidding?

789
00:50:29.461 --> 00:50:32.790
Who you're not fucking working today either.
All right.

790
00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:38.150
I have to go to a picnic.
That kid picnic and I can't wait.
You know what?

791
00:50:38.151 --> 00:50:42.380
I actually got a great book here.
It says 88 great daddy daughter dates.

792
00:50:42.890 --> 00:50:46.970
And I think I'm going to do most of these,
you know,
I got all these books.

793
00:50:46.971 --> 00:50:51.950
You know,
uh,
dad's prayers for his daughter's daughter.

794
00:50:51.980 --> 00:50:56.660
That's fucking weird.
Strong fathers,
strong daughters,

795
00:50:56.661 --> 00:50:58.910
10 secrets every father should know.
All right,

796
00:50:58.911 --> 00:51:03.620
let's read a little bit of this sandwich to the Segree.
Protect her.

797
00:51:03.930 --> 00:51:08.600
Defend her.
Okay.
She needs,
oh my God.
How awful.

798
00:51:08.601 --> 00:51:12.020
This is like,
all right.

799
00:51:12.021 --> 00:51:16.160
How dumb would you have to be to read this fucking book?
Okay.
One,

800
00:51:16.161 --> 00:51:20.510
you are the most important man in her life.
Chapter two,

801
00:51:20.511 --> 00:51:23.240
she needs a hero.
Chapter three,

802
00:51:23.241 --> 00:51:27.750
you are her first love chapter four,
teacher humility.
Oh,

803
00:51:27.751 --> 00:51:31.820
she shouldn't stand there like a Lebron James after you just blocked a shot.
Uh,

804
00:51:31.840 --> 00:51:35.480
protect her,
defend her and use a shotgun if necessary.

805
00:51:36.890 --> 00:51:39.140
Pragmatism and grit.
Your two greatest,

806
00:51:39.141 --> 00:51:41.480
I'll read that chapter because I don't know what either one of those means.

807
00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:44.630
I know one of them was a John Wayne movie.

808
00:51:45.950 --> 00:51:50.660
Be the man you want her to marry.
Gross.
Uh,

809
00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:55.070
teacher.
Who God is gross teacher to fight.
That's right.

810
00:51:55.160 --> 00:51:57.890
There you go.
Keep her connected

811
00:51:59.110 --> 00:52:03.370
afterward.
Acknowledgments,
bibliography,

812
00:52:04.180 --> 00:52:07.690
notes,
index.
I don't know what those last three chapters were about.
Let's see.

813
00:52:07.691 --> 00:52:08.560
Let's read the chapter.

814
00:52:11.720 --> 00:52:12.710
We'll start with index here.

815
00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:17.150
Let's see what the Hell I'm supposed to tell my daughter a abortion.

816
00:52:17.330 --> 00:52:22.330
12 abstinence comma went 13 dash one 14 I,

817
00:52:23.241 --> 00:52:26.090
this doesn't make any sense.
Add health study,

818
00:52:27.460 --> 00:52:28.510
<v 2>ADHD</v>

819
00:52:30.370 --> 00:52:34.420
<v 1>advertising,
African Americans.
This book is all over the place.</v>

820
00:52:36.730 --> 00:52:39.730
African Americans and it says depression and s t

821
00:52:40.360 --> 00:52:42.490
<v 2>ds
aids.</v>

822
00:52:44.760 --> 00:52:46.890
<v 1>But why did you have to drag black people into this?</v>

823
00:52:46.920 --> 00:52:50.440
Alcohol use is a weird chapter.
I don't think I liked this book.
I know that.

824
00:52:50.441 --> 00:52:54.630
I don't know who wrote.
Um,
anyways,

825
00:52:58.530 --> 00:53:02.430
oh,
fucking Billy burger face going to go fucking turn on the grill.

826
00:53:03.390 --> 00:53:07.800
Make a few here.
Um,
this is one of my last podcasts in my forties.

827
00:53:09.360 --> 00:53:12.480
This is so stupid.
I'm turning 50.
I'm not going to feel any fucking differently.

828
00:53:13.130 --> 00:53:17.910
Um,
I'm definitely gonna try to eat better and I've been doing that for the last

829
00:53:17.911 --> 00:53:21.810
three months and I was facetiming with somebody and they would like to have you

830
00:53:21.811 --> 00:53:25.980
lost weight.
And I was like,
Nah,
not really.
Yeah.
Woo.

831
00:53:26.010 --> 00:53:30.510
I was excited.
Um,
so anyways,

832
00:53:31.170 --> 00:53:35.630
um,
I think that's it,
right?
Anything.

833
00:53:35.640 --> 00:53:39.750
I'm doing a drum,
do my double bass drum.
It's coming along.
It's coming along,

834
00:53:39.840 --> 00:53:42.320
you know,
working on that song.
I,
the beholder.

835
00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:46.620
I the bowl holder for little Metallica.
Oh.
And I played streets of San Francisco.

836
00:53:46.650 --> 00:53:49.950
It's all serendipity.
All right.
This is,
this is it.
I'm done.

837
00:53:49.951 --> 00:53:52.680
I'm not going to just fucking meander for another fucking six minutes just to

838
00:53:52.681 --> 00:53:55.540
say I did it once again.
I apologize everybody.

839
00:53:55.560 --> 00:53:58.160
Cleveland and in Philly for being a contact,
right?
You want a Superbowl?

840
00:53:58.230 --> 00:54:00.960
Congratulations.
You go in the NBA finals.
Congratulations.

841
00:54:01.140 --> 00:54:04.560
I hope you fucking cheese steaks.
And whenever the fuck it is,

842
00:54:04.561 --> 00:54:07.620
you guys eat there in Cleveland.
I hope they taste extra better today.

843
00:54:07.710 --> 00:54:11.970
Extra special.
All right,
