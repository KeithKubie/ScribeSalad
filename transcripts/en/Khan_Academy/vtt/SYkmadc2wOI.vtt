00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:01.490
We're asked how many

00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:04.410
centiliters are in one dekaliter?

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.710
So the first thing we want to
do is just think about how

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.270
much is a centiliter relative to
a liter, and how much is a

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:11.120
dekaliter relative to a liter?

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.710
And I'll write the
prefixes down.

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:15.173
And really, you should have
these memorized because you're

00:00:15.173 --> 00:00:17.250
going to see these prefixes
over and over again for

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.880
different types of units.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.890
So the prefix, kilo, sometimes
[? ki-lo, ?]

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.260
this means 1,000.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:33.670
If you see hecto,
hecto means 100.

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.100
Deka means 10.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.220
If you have nothing, then
that just means 1.

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:42.670
Let's put that there.

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.940
Then if you have deci,
this means 1/10.

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:54.810
If you have centi,
this means 1/100.

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:59.570
If you have milli, this
means 1/1,000.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.220
So let's go back to what we
have. We have centiliters.

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:06.640
Let me write this in
a different color.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:22.350
If you have a centiliter, this
is equal to 1/100 of a liter,

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.430
Or you could say 1 liter for
every 100 centiliters, so you

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:34.310
could also write it like this:
1 liter for every 100, or per

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:42.060
every 100, centiliters.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.940
So we got the centi, now let's
think about the dekaliter.

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:46.820
So the deka is right
over here.

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:54.880
So a dekaliter means
10 liters.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:02.300
Or another way to say it is for
every 10 liters, you will

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.930
have 1 dekaliter.

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.090
Now, before I actually
work out the problem,

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.240
what's going on here?

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.380
We're going from a smaller
unit to a larger unit, so

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.440
there are going to be many of
the smaller units in one of

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.380
the larger ones.

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.190
And we can do it
multiple ways.

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.740
So we want to essentially
convert 1 dekaliter into

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:24.600
centiliters.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.590
Now, we could just do it by
looking at this chart, or we

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.930
could do it with the dimensional
analysis, making

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.020
sure the dimensions work out.

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.240
Let's do it the first way.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:37.680
So if you have one dekaliter,
how many liters is that?

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.690
1 dekaliter over here would be
the same thing as 10 liters.

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:48.860
That's liters.

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.290
We're assuming that our
unit is liters here.

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.380
And then 10 liters is going
to be how many deciliters?

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.990
It's going to be 100
deciliters, right?

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:59.370
Because each of these is
10 deciliters, and

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:00.750
you have 10 of them.

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.790
So every time you go down,
you're going to be multiplying

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.510
by a factor of 10.

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.560
100 deciliters is how
many centiliters?

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.000
Well, 100 deciliters, each of
them is going to be worth 10

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.650
centiliters, so that's going
to be 1,000 centiliters.

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.920
So we have our answer:
1 dekaliter is 1,000

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.170
centiliters.

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.690
Now, the other way to do it is
you could convert a dekaliter

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.480
to liters, and then convert
a liter to centiliters.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:37.780
So if we have one dekaliter--
and whenever you do unit

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.550
things, just make sure
that it makes sense.

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.380
Sometimes, people, instead of
multiplying, they would

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.710
divide, and then they'd get,
oh, 1 dekaliter is equal to

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:47.440
1/1,000 of a centiliter.

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:48.300
And they say, no, no, no, no.

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.130
A dekaliter is a much larger
unit that a centiliter.

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.720
So 1 dekaliter has to be
a bunch of centiliters.

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.970
This should be a large number,
so you should always do that

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.020
reality check whenever you're
dealing with units.

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:01.540
Now, let's do it the dimensional
analysis way.

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.640
We're starting with
one dekaliter.

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.250
We want to convert
it to liters.

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.800
So if you're converting it to
liters, you want the dekaliter

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:13.120
in the denominator and you want
liters in the numerator.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.060
Now, how many liters
are 1 dekaliter?

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.620
Well, you could say 10 liters
is equal to 1 dekaliter.

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:27.300
So 1 dekaliter is equal
to-- these cancel out.

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.270
1 times 10 is 10 liters.

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.570
Now, if we wanted to convert
this to centiliters, we're

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.850
going to want the liters in the
denominator, and you want

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:40.855
the centiliters in
the numerator.

00:04:40.855 --> 00:04:41.230
Now,

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:43.900
how many centiliters are
there per liter?

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.135
How many centiliters?

00:04:46.135 --> 00:04:49.020
Well, 1 liter is 100
centiliters.

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.790
Centiliter is 1/100
of a liter.

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:54.280
Notice, this and this are
the inverse statements.

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:55.540
They're saying same the
exact same thing.

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:56.760
1 liter per 100 centiliters.

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.370
Here, writing 1 liter
per 100 centiliters.

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.450
We've just flipped it, but
they're giving the same

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:02.400
information.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.400
And the reason why we flipped
it is so that the liters

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.860
cancel out, and then we're just
left with 10 times 100 is

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:13.880
1,000 centiliters.

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.850
And we are done!
