00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.460
Let's will about the Joe Rogan experience.

2
00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.400
I don't know if he does it as much or as often as I do,

3
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.560
but I do cause I do the clubs.

4
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:12.800
I have a philosophy about what's required to develop great standup that you have

5
00:00:13.171 --> 00:00:17.850
to do a lot of sets,
you have to do a lot of numbers,
a lot of different places,

6
00:00:17.851 --> 00:00:21.150
different environments and I found that out the hard way through my best

7
00:00:21.151 --> 00:00:23.470
performances in my less good performances.

8
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:24.900
Like what was missing and what did I do

9
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.810
<v 1>game you like racy I think is there sort of an interesting debate a,</v>

10
00:00:29.811 --> 00:00:30.080
you know,

11
00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.970
I don't know if it's in standup world at large but it's only saying I've thought

12
00:00:32.971 --> 00:00:37.890
about a lot is like that as soon as I was able to have an audience that would

13
00:00:37.891 --> 00:00:41.220
come and see me,
I was like I'm out.
Thank you God,

14
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.720
you know that I'm not putting myself through that shit again.

15
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.670
Those Dan hope feels the same way.
By the way.

16
00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.910
He's one of the best and he's amazing.
He's absolutely fantastic.

17
00:00:50.911 --> 00:00:53.460
I completely agree.
And like,
cause I,
I fought like,

18
00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:57.780
cause what I feel like is that the comedy club environment warps your material

19
00:00:57.781 --> 00:00:59.880
because you've got a appeal to them.

20
00:00:59.881 --> 00:01:04.290
And I think you ain't the fucking arbiters of truth.
You've drunk and crazy too.

21
00:01:04.291 --> 00:01:09.090
Am Mutha fuckers like so I get a lot.
I perform.
I'll,
what I'll do is I am,

22
00:01:09.091 --> 00:01:13.340
what I'm doing to say at the moment is I'll book the UCB like a or like places a

23
00:01:13.341 --> 00:01:17.000
hundred,
200 or go Largo or put on events and I'm doing events while,

24
00:01:17.001 --> 00:01:18.250
I mean La Cause I think,

25
00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.900
oh these people come and they love me and they bring me beads and then here's

26
00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.390
some vegan cookies and are you got to come to the comedy store man and go on

27
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.300
after Joey Diaz.

28
00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.670
[inaudible]

29
00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.770
cause I feel like I like a nurturing environment.
It got in there.

30
00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.260
I mean cause I've done those fucking clubs and like,
you know,

31
00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.550
uneven comedy store and late at night comedy store in La,
you know,

32
00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.030
as well as London.
And I felt like,
oh Jesus,
thank God.
And after,

33
00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.550
so like I'm interested to you.
That's part of that.

34
00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.140
What I think some people could reductively refer to his machismo in you like

35
00:01:52.141 --> 00:01:54.200
that you go,
no,
I'm going in now.

36
00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.150
<v 0>It is.
It's that guy that mounted you and went for the arm bar new escaped.</v>

37
00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.810
Right.
It's worth it because it was hard.
You like,

38
00:02:02.811 --> 00:02:06.650
you realize if a child got on top of you and went for an arm bar,
new escape,

39
00:02:06.651 --> 00:02:11.120
you'd feel nothing.
So when you're at Largo,
you're performing for children.
Yeah,

40
00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.000
<v 1>you're doing child stand up.
It's like</v>

41
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.890
<v 0>wrestling with a hundred pound women who just started yesterday.</v>

42
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.990
<v 1>You like the make a wish foundation.
Go Russell.
Then tell us your stories.</v>

43
00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.580
[inaudible] wonderful.
We brought him flowers.
Thank you.
Thank you children.

44
00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:30.623
But,
but like look,

45
00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.430
the counter argument to that is that therefore I am in an environment that is

46
00:02:35.431 --> 00:02:40.431
sympathetic and he is my audience and I'm not biasing I you what?

47
00:02:40.501 --> 00:02:43.260
You know,
the idea of overcoming a greater obstacle.

48
00:02:43.261 --> 00:02:44.970
I completely appreciate what you're saying,

49
00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:49.440
but say you believe in the pure EIF stand up as being some real expression of

50
00:02:49.441 --> 00:02:52.110
yourself as in the Arrow hitting the bullseye.

51
00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.970
I feel like I have a vision of what I'm trying to achieve and increasingly is

52
00:02:56.971 --> 00:03:00.490
becoming about I want my stand up,
I want to hang on.
You know,

53
00:03:00.491 --> 00:03:03.520
like as I've always done stories where I feel embarrassed and humiliated,

54
00:03:03.521 --> 00:03:07.780
but I want to hang off it ruminations on what are believed to be the nature of

55
00:03:07.781 --> 00:03:10.740
truth.
And I want people to come out of those things feeling loved,
validated,

56
00:03:10.741 --> 00:03:13.640
accepted,
and that they're good enough and that they can explore themselves.

57
00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.800
You know?
That's more of a one man show in a sense.
It's that,

58
00:03:16.801 --> 00:03:19.990
but I don't want to like sacrifice the laughs,
you know?
I mean,
I love the loss,

59
00:03:19.991 --> 00:03:22.450
the loss,
what is where we're at,
you know,
that's,

60
00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:24.640
you don't have to sacrifice in a one man show.
I mean,

61
00:03:24.641 --> 00:03:27.190
you can certainly do a one man show that it'd be really funny,

62
00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.070
but say you start going into,
yeah,
that's what I'm doing and I'm sort of,

63
00:03:30.071 --> 00:03:33.280
I'm trying to build things like around 12 steps and trying to like doing things

64
00:03:33.281 --> 00:03:36.010
that people have some takeaway value from now.
Like,

65
00:03:36.011 --> 00:03:39.550
you know like trying to develop that after Joey Diaz in the store.

66
00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.280
It's going to be some resistance.

67
00:03:42.281 --> 00:03:46.210
You are aware of Hannah Gadsby and the controversy of this?

68
00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.100
I haven't seen it.
Yeah.
Not necessarily.
I'm going to see it,

69
00:03:50.101 --> 00:03:53.080
but because what the end of comedy and all that kind of thing,
it's silly.

70
00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:57.420
It's no end of comedy.
But she what she's doing people like,
and there's nothing,

71
00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.310
I don't know what you call it,
whatever you want.
Sometimes it's funny,

72
00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.030
I mean maybe it's standup comedy.
Some of my mates version,

73
00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.650
they told me towards the end it black of become a sort of quite aggressive

74
00:04:05.651 --> 00:04:08.950
towards you and it came like a tedtalk almost.
I guess.

75
00:04:08.951 --> 00:04:11.080
Apparently I'm interested in or you know,
that's,
you know,
yeah,

76
00:04:11.081 --> 00:04:13.000
there's enough room for everyone to exert,

77
00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.110
to do whatever they're doing but at like see at the beginning of my guys call it

78
00:04:17.111 --> 00:04:20.860
Korea,
like I used to not prepare at all.
I was still drinking and using.

79
00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:23.890
I'd got up on stage,
I chop shit up.
I'd get into confrontation.

80
00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.000
When I say truck shop,
I'd take up animals,
shit,
part animal parts.

81
00:04:28.001 --> 00:04:30.010
I'd got from Brookshire's like like a skull.

82
00:04:30.011 --> 00:04:33.940
We've all meat and stuff and send you on it,
chop it up for a news release.

83
00:04:33.941 --> 00:04:38.500
Locusts get into confrontations like so yeah,
exactly.
The reaction you're having,

84
00:04:38.501 --> 00:04:41.280
his direction they were having,
that's as soon as the front row.

85
00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:42.850
I had like a fight.

86
00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:46.420
I've got scars on my body from bad standup gigs from a time where I've got into

87
00:04:46.421 --> 00:04:50.230
a confrontation.
Like I was making a point about pedophilia saying,
oh,

88
00:04:50.231 --> 00:04:51.550
we're all one cultural mind.

89
00:04:51.551 --> 00:04:54.370
So when a particular Peter File is transgressed against a child,

90
00:04:54.371 --> 00:04:57.890
we're all responsible.
People are like,
what the fuck?
They're like,

91
00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:00.820
I've got the shit kicked out.
Well that time,
you know,

92
00:05:00.821 --> 00:05:03.580
I've still got the scar on my leg that happened at Edinburgh in Scotland.

93
00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.780
People didn't take it well like so,

94
00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:10.950
but what I was trying to do was like create,
I didn't have the skills,
the chops,

95
00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:14.020
the experience than jokes.
So is so under equipped,

96
00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:18.700
but like what I was trying to do was create environments that felt,
you know,

97
00:05:18.701 --> 00:05:20.230
I'm much better at doing that now.

98
00:05:20.231 --> 00:05:24.640
I can create at kind of an uncertainty in a room or kind of a sense of chaos and

99
00:05:24.641 --> 00:05:25.990
what's happening and then bring it back.

100
00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:30.370
I hope to a humorous conclusion where people feel safe and amused and all of

101
00:05:30.371 --> 00:05:32.930
that kind of stuff.
Now I think it's you like,

102
00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:35.970
cause I did try and do that in comedy clubs and yeah it was compensation.

103
00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:36.970
It's not what people want.

104
00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:41.860
So don't you think that by prepping your stand up in those environments that it

105
00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:46.840
biases you towards a type of standup comedy that is limited?
No,

106
00:05:46.841 --> 00:05:49.000
because you can do that other stuff too.

107
00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:53.200
You can always perform to your crowd and you could always expand on things to

108
00:05:53.201 --> 00:05:53.861
your crowd.

109
00:05:53.861 --> 00:05:58.861
But to really put it together without any fluff,

110
00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.960
<v 0>without any nonsense,
without being self indulgent,</v>

111
00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:07.040
with respecting the attention span of the audience that may or may not even be

112
00:06:07.041 --> 00:06:08.690
there to see you most likely is not.

113
00:06:08.691 --> 00:06:11.510
If you go to a comedy club and there's a large,
you know,

114
00:06:11.511 --> 00:06:13.190
if you go to the comedy store any night of the week,

115
00:06:13.191 --> 00:06:16.790
there's 15 plus people on the marquee or on the list.

116
00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:21.350
And the show starts at 8:00 PM or 9:00 PM depending on the night and it goes to

117
00:06:21.351 --> 00:06:23.150
two o'clock in the morning and you know,

118
00:06:23.151 --> 00:06:28.151
you catch waves in there and there's different types of comedy and in that

119
00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.130
you're going to deal with sometimes tired audiences,

120
00:06:31.131 --> 00:06:34.850
sometimes enthusiastic people.
It's all different.
It varies widely.

121
00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:36.680
And I think that um,

122
00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:42.040
in doing that you cut all the nonsense out of your act and you develop an

123
00:06:42.041 --> 00:06:43.250
economy of words.

124
00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:46.970
You understand how to captivate people's attention and keep them engaged and to

125
00:06:46.971 --> 00:06:50.210
respect their time,
respect their point of view,

126
00:06:50.211 --> 00:06:54.690
respect that these people have an attention span,
they want to be engaged in,

127
00:06:54.691 --> 00:06:56.780
in the best possible way that you can do it.

128
00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:02.080
And sometimes you develop that through these really difficult sets or you know,

129
00:07:02.481 --> 00:07:05.930
distracted people and drunks and all that stuff.
You can develop that,

130
00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:07.160
those qualities.

131
00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:11.180
You're always going to have your crowd and what your crowd,

132
00:07:11.181 --> 00:07:13.850
I mean if you have this,
this vision of how you want to put things together,

133
00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:17.090
you could put that kind of thing together at a comedy club.

134
00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:18.670
You're doing it in these 15 minute chunks,

135
00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:22.700
you just have to figure out a way to grab them and make them really interested

136
00:07:22.701 --> 00:07:23.630
in what you have to say.

137
00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:24.101
<v 1>You're right.</v>

138
00:07:24.101 --> 00:07:28.420
Because there's obviously in like the comedy store between now as you've just

139
00:07:28.421 --> 00:07:31.420
described,
there's a contract,
we're here not gaining at cu.

140
00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:35.800
We're to love every 15 seconds.
I'm like,
you know comics like,
you know,

141
00:07:35.801 --> 00:07:39.820
like Robin Williams or Chappelle's the,
you know,
the all time greats.
They went,

142
00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:42.780
they go in and accept those conditions and I,
you know,

143
00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:45.220
you've seen stuff I'm sure like Robin Williams,

144
00:07:45.221 --> 00:07:48.520
he's just like walking around in the crowd in that very room and do is like,

145
00:07:48.521 --> 00:07:52.090
he's like,
he's doing the thing I'm talking about and he's doing it there.

146
00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:55.690
You know?
That's when you think,
yeah.
If I suppose I do get that,

147
00:07:55.691 --> 00:07:57.800
that your road testing it to you,

148
00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:00.970
each durability to an incredible degree if you can pull it off there.
Yeah.

149
00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:04.610
<v 0>Well,
think about every time you're saying something when you're,</v>

150
00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:06.290
you have a subject like say if you want to,

151
00:08:06.291 --> 00:08:10.260
do you want to talk about the mentors that you have in life?
There's,

152
00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:11.840
it's an open ended approach.

153
00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:15.950
You have no idea what the correct way to say something is.

154
00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:20.240
You try it,
you,
you write it out,
you say,
this seems feasible.

155
00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:24.800
Let me try it this way.
And oftentimes people never correct it or they never,

156
00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:27.290
they never adjusted,
they never go back and improve it.

157
00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:29.960
They just say it in a certain way and figure out how to do it.

158
00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:32.720
When you're doing an in front of a crowd,

159
00:08:32.810 --> 00:08:37.810
you're developing these things while also feeling the way people reacting to

160
00:08:38.301 --> 00:08:43.301
them and feeling their attention span and it makes you with proper reflection

161
00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:47.060
and truly objective listening to your material.

162
00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:52.250
It makes you change and shift and adjust things and hopefully in a positive way.

163
00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:55.320
And the more you do it,
the more you get a sense of,

164
00:08:55.321 --> 00:08:59.430
maybe this is clunky here and maybe I figured out a better way to say it and

165
00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:02.020
<v 1>I agree.
But the counterargument could be the,</v>

166
00:09:02.021 --> 00:09:05.850
it could buy us you to a sort of a lowest common denominator area.

167
00:09:05.851 --> 00:09:09.510
Say where that bit where you talk about the sun and you know it's,
you know,

168
00:09:09.511 --> 00:09:12.410
you need it,
he's trying to kill you.
It gives you cancer,
you know,

169
00:09:12.411 --> 00:09:17.411
like something like what was the journey of that bear stand up.

170
00:09:17.551 --> 00:09:18.660
Is this like for me it's like,

171
00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:22.770
oh I think of before I try and make sure there's a tag so I know where I'm going

172
00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:26.990
when I'm out there.
And then it's as comparable process do yours,

173
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.010
you're trying your best to get rid of fluff or wherever.

174
00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:32.430
So can you recall like why it's like,
you know,

175
00:09:32.431 --> 00:09:35.550
are you night after night go in in with new bits of material,

176
00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:38.170
packaged within fee things that you are a little more confident?

177
00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:41.670
I put that bit on a special,
I can do it better now.

178
00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:45.500
<v 0>Better way to do it.
And that's part of the problem with doing bits.</v>

179
00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:47.810
So like sometimes you released them on a special,

180
00:09:47.811 --> 00:09:49.430
you have a better version of it now.

181
00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:54.710
But my point of that was to a prospective enhancer to let people know that bit

182
00:09:54.711 --> 00:09:56.900
was about like understanding what's happening here.

183
00:09:57.140 --> 00:10:01.760
You are literally floating in infinity and it's almost never discussed.

184
00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:05.630
You're hurling through forever.
There's a fireball on the sky,

185
00:10:05.631 --> 00:10:09.080
it's a million times bigger than earth.
If you stare at it,
you'll go blind.

186
00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:11.930
It's trying to give you cancer and if it's not there,
you get sad.

187
00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:17.630
You live in a dream like this is madness.
You're life is madness and beautiful.

188
00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:19.580
Yeah it is.
But I wanted,

189
00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:25.060
there's something about that particular way of IX seat cause I figured out a way

190
00:10:25.521 --> 00:10:30.080
to express it short in short doses,
in short bursts,

191
00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:31.160
if you know,

192
00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:34.370
if you stared at would go blind and he's trying to give you cancer and if it's

193
00:10:34.371 --> 00:10:38.300
not there,
you get sad.
So in that short bursts like myths,
you know like wow.
Yeah,

194
00:10:38.301 --> 00:10:40.610
that is all those things are true.
Like this is crazy.

195
00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:44.270
There really is a fireball floating in the sky and we're just used to it.

196
00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:48.230
We live because of a floating million times bigger than the earth.

197
00:10:48.231 --> 00:10:50.930
Fireball and I,
when you say,

198
00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:53.630
if you could say something like that and make someone laugh,

199
00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:57.590
you can actually change the way they look at things.

200
00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:00.290
You can actually affect at least the way they look at things.

201
00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:05.000
If you just say something,
sometimes it's profound.
Sometimes it registers,

202
00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:08.120
but if you could say something and it forces someone to laugh,

203
00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:11.060
even if they disagree with you,
if they're laughing like,

204
00:11:11.061 --> 00:11:13.430
I don't even fucking agree with this,
but holy shit,
this is funny.

205
00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:18.730
You put that thought deep into someone's head and you allow them to think about

206
00:11:19.671 --> 00:11:24.671
your thought process and how your creative process and what you're doing to sort

207
00:11:24.831 --> 00:11:26.570
of bring these things out.

208
00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:30.190
<v 1>Yes.
I like the way you just described the architecture of that.</v>

209
00:11:30.191 --> 00:11:34.450
You've got to basically have,
these are some facts about the sun irrefutable.

210
00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:39.460
Now here is how that affects the way we look at the world and exposes to us that

211
00:11:39.461 --> 00:11:42.640
we're just ignorant.
We're not awake to reality.

212
00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:47.320
We can't hold reality in our minds because it's too vast to handle.

213
00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:52.120
I like it and I agree with you that let you know that way of laughter comes

214
00:11:52.121 --> 00:11:56.470
access to kind of truths.
And I've heard some therapists in fact say that,
uh,

215
00:11:56.500 --> 00:12:00.880
like the laughter is to shame what grief is to sadness.

216
00:12:00.881 --> 00:12:05.080
That laughter is helping to expel shame and to process Shane.

217
00:12:05.081 --> 00:12:08.470
That is something very important about people coming together and laughing

218
00:12:08.471 --> 00:12:12.440
together.
Uh,
I,
I like to exist comedically in worldwide.

219
00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:15.340
I start from a deeply personal perspective and an admissions and

220
00:12:15.341 --> 00:12:19.510
acknowledgements of humiliation and shame and vulnerability and travels out to

221
00:12:19.511 --> 00:12:20.760
the universe or,

222
00:12:20.761 --> 00:12:23.470
and hopefully archetype all that you can sort of travel between those points.

223
00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:28.090
The comedian,
nothing.
We both admire Bill Hicks.
Well I think he's fascinating.

224
00:12:28.091 --> 00:12:31.130
He's got to let you know,
like if you've loved Bill Hicks for a long while,

225
00:12:31.131 --> 00:12:35.920
then you discover,
man,
that guy works material a lot.
You know,

226
00:12:35.921 --> 00:12:38.650
like you go,
I watched this interview with him on the Australian TV.

227
00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:41.370
He's doing like a bit that I've seen him do,
you know,

228
00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:45.790
in multiple incarnations.
But I have also seen him do interviews,

229
00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:49.420
ways spontaneously talking about gigs,
terrible gigs that have gone badly.

230
00:12:49.421 --> 00:12:51.520
And he is hilarious.
But it's very interesting to me,

231
00:12:51.521 --> 00:12:55.240
and perhaps it's because of that background and that practice of doing clubs

232
00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:59.220
that Hicks is very much a comedian that's,
no,

233
00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:02.920
I'm drilling this fucking thing and I'm staying with it.
He was a writer.
I mean,

234
00:13:02.921 --> 00:13:07.600
he did ad Lib and he did.
He was capable of going on these rants,

235
00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:11.200
spontaneous rounds.
But he was a writer.
He wrote these things out,

236
00:13:11.201 --> 00:13:15.010
and he was aiming to have an impact with his commentary.
I mean,

237
00:13:15.011 --> 00:13:18.640
that was what was was he was doing.
It was not just trying to make you laugh,

238
00:13:18.641 --> 00:13:23.200
he was aiming to enhance your,
your perspective on whatever he was talking about.

239
00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:27.010
Yeah.
And as a,
it seems very disciplined as a practitioner of it.
Yeah.

240
00:13:33.270 --> 00:13:34.200
<v 2>[inaudible].</v>
