00:00:01.602 --> 00:00:05.472
- THIS IS MY BEAUTIFUL BABY.
HIS NAME IS DONNIE.

00:00:05.506 --> 00:00:07.908
- AWW!
- WHAT A PRETTY NAME!

00:00:07.941 --> 00:00:10.143
- THANKS.
I GOT IT OUT OF A BOOK.

00:00:10.177 --> 00:00:12.679
I DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO
GO THROUGH THE OTHER BOOK.

00:00:12.713 --> 00:00:15.983
- "BACARDI, LISTERINE,
ARUGULA."

00:00:16.016 --> 00:00:18.418
- OH, THERE'S MY SHOPPING LIST.
[laughs]

00:00:18.452 --> 00:00:19.920
NOW CONNIE,
I'M SORRY ABOUT THIS,

00:00:19.953 --> 00:00:21.855
BUT FEDERAL GUIDELINES DICTATE

00:00:21.889 --> 00:00:24.157
THAT I DON'T HAVE
TO LET YOU BREASTFEED AT WORK

00:00:24.191 --> 00:00:26.593
UNLESS YOU GOT A REAL SWEET SET
OF MILKIES.

00:00:26.627 --> 00:00:28.095
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH MY BOOBS?

00:00:28.128 --> 00:00:30.564
- BESIDES THE FACT THAT YOU ALSO
HAVE A BACK SET?

00:00:32.032 --> 00:00:34.968
- AHH! ANTICHRIST!
ANTICHRIST!

00:00:35.002 --> 00:00:36.703
- THIS IS GOING TOO FAR,
DENZEL!

00:00:36.737 --> 00:00:38.605
- THAT BABY'S EVIL.
I'LL PROVE IT!

00:00:38.639 --> 00:00:39.606
- HOW?
- THROUGH SCIENCE.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.074
[cocks gun]

00:00:41.108 --> 00:00:42.776
IF I SHOOT IT IN THE FACE
AND IT LIVES, IT'S THE DEVIL.

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:43.944
- OKAY! OKAY!

00:00:43.977 --> 00:00:45.612
SHOOT IT
IF IT WILL SHUT YOU UP.

00:00:45.646 --> 00:00:46.680
- NO!

00:00:46.713 --> 00:00:48.582
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
MY FRIEND, DENZEL!

00:00:48.615 --> 00:00:51.218
HOW COULD YOU SAY THOSE
HORRIBLE THINGS ABOUT MY BABY?

00:00:51.251 --> 00:00:53.187
[crying]

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.722
- IT'S JUST A BABY, DENZEL.

00:00:55.756 --> 00:00:58.492
- THIS HAS GOT TO STOP.
YOU REALLY UPSET CONNIE.

00:00:58.525 --> 00:01:01.161
- NEXT TIME DON'T HESITATE.
AIM FOR THE FONTANELLE.

00:01:01.195 --> 00:01:03.330
- ALL RIGHT! ENOUGH WITH
THE BLACK BABY NAMES.

00:01:03.363 --> 00:01:05.666
I GUESS I SHOULD APOLOGIZE
TO CONNIE AND DONNIE.

00:01:05.699 --> 00:01:07.501
- LEAVE THE GUN!
- FINE!

00:01:09.203 --> 00:01:11.071
CONNIE, I'M SORRY...

00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:13.607
- [snoring]

00:01:15.642 --> 00:01:18.779
- UH, DONNIE, I'M NOT GOOD
AT THIS APOLOGY STUFF, BUT...

00:01:18.812 --> 00:01:20.280
I'M SORRY I SAID
YOU WERE THE ANTICHRIST.

00:01:20.314 --> 00:01:21.882
MAYBE WHEN YOU GROW UP
A LITTLE, YOU AND I CAN--

00:01:21.915 --> 00:01:23.884
- [demonic voice]
APOLOGY ACCEPTED.

00:01:23.917 --> 00:01:25.419
- OH, THANKS, DONNIE.
YOU'RE PRETTY COOL.

00:01:25.452 --> 00:01:26.720
WAIT, YOU CAN TALK?

00:01:26.753 --> 00:01:29.723
- DENZEL, I'M GOING
TO RIP OUT YOUR DICK

00:01:29.756 --> 00:01:32.092
AND FEED IT
TO THE DEMONS OF HELL!

00:01:32.092 --> 00:01:33.293
[growling]

00:01:34.294 --> 00:01:36.196
- [screaming]
