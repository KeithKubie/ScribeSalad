AMRIT DHIR: I'm Amrit
Dhir, and it's my pleasure

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.600
to introduce Emily Baxter,
who is the director of We Are

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.250
All Criminals and a current
fellow at the University

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.100
of Minnesota Law School's
Robina Institute of Criminal

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.470
Law and Criminal Justice.

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.100
So I'm going to speak
for just a few minutes.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.990
But Emily asked me not
to speak to specifically

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.989
about what WAAC does-- WAAC
is, I think, the best acronym--

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:30.530
because she'll be speaking about
that for most of the next 40

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.540
minutes or so.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.650
So I want to take
just 90 seconds

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.090
and tell you a little bit about
why this movement motivates me,

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.090
and why I'm really glad that
Emily has come and accepted

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.480
our offer to come
speak at Google.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.210
So there are at least two broad
reasons that I can point to.

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.820
The first is that I am,
like probably many of us,

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.460
a serial criminal offender.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:55.350
Yeah.

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.490
That was a woohoo for
anyone who couldn't hear it.

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.220
Just yesterday, for
example, while taking

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.760
Emily on a brief walking tour
of San Francisco, I jaywalked.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.020
The fact that we can
commit crimes and have

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.810
zero implications
for it, or close

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.040
to zero consequences for
it, is more than just

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.220
being crafty at
committing these crimes.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.990
It's about, for example,
the neighborhood you live in

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.240
or the social stratum that you
happen to have been born in.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.920
And that is unfair.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.080
The second reason is related.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.530
Before joining Google,
I went to law school.

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:38.110
And although I knew about two
weeks into Civil Procedure

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.694
that I shouldn't
be a lawyer, there

00:01:40.694 --> 00:01:43.360
was one class-- I know there are
some lawyers in the room, which

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.500
I'm glad to see-- there was one
class that really motivated me

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.040
and I know motivated a
lot of other classmates.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.560
And motivated, I should
say actually infuriated me.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.440
And that was Criminal Law.

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.477
You learn a lot in that class.

00:01:55.477 --> 00:01:57.060
And one of the things
that I took away

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.980
was that our criminal
justice system

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:03.140
has become a lot about
retribution in some ways

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.800
more than rehabilitation.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.680
And in many ways,
I would argue more

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.289
about punishment
and incarceration

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.370
than deterrence and protection.

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.050
Yet I've seen encouraging
signs in the past couple years

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.360
and I would say in the
past couple months as well.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.170
And I think that we may
be in for a Watershed

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.430
moment on this issue.

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.750
From national media, to
casual conversations,

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.040
to John Oliver's
repeated brilliance,

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.760
there appears to be increased
attention, increased empathy

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.490
in the public dialogue
on incarceration,

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.560
criminal records,
reintegration, and reform.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.110
And if that's right-- I
should actually caveat.

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.340
And this may actually go
against my prediction.

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.700
But I also think that
we're in a Watershed moment

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.110
for bidets in bathrooms,
which is a very Google point.

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.190
So I could be wrong
about either one or both.

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:53.970
But if that's right,
I think Emily Baxter

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.250
and we all criminals
will have been

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.360
an important part of that
movement and that awakening.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.426
So please join me in
welcoming Emily Baxter.

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.420
EMILY BAXTER: Thank you so
much for joining us today.

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.567
Several years ago, I
was working at a legal--

00:03:17.567 --> 00:03:19.300
is that some feedback?

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:20.580
OK.

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.230
Several years ago, I was
working at a legal advocacy

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.330
organization's
expungement clinic,

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.360
monthly workshops held in the
basement of a government center

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.910
in small, windowless rooms.

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.900
I'm sure the sun
had long since set

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.770
by the time our final
participant walked in.

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:45.650
Anthony came in and sat
across the table from me.

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:48.320
And pulled from his
back pocket a copy

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.210
of his criminal record, a
printout he had received

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:53.760
from a terminal upstairs.

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.310
I opened it up and
was thankful to find

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.940
that it was just a theft,
and a minor one at that.

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:06.190
I let out a short
laugh of relief.

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.420
Even if the court didn't
expunge the matter,

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:14.350
I said, it's not like
your life is over.

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:19.070
And with that,
Anthony began to cry.

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:20.680
He told me that
earlier that day,

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.030
he had considered
taking his own life.

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:28.330
You see, for me, it
was just a theft.

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.650
But for Anthony,
it was a lost job.

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.650
It was missed housing payments.

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.030
It was skipped meals.

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.450
It was door after door
slammed in his face.

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:43.560
It was the loss of respect
from his friends and family,

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:49.590
the loss of a sense of
self, and the loss of hope.

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.130
Around this same
time, I had been

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:54.270
driving all around the
state of Minnesota,

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:58.370
meeting with employers
and landlords, legislators

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:00.740
and licensing
boards, asking them

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.080
to create the capacity
for second chances

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.400
for individuals with
criminal records.

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.590
Time and again, I heard,
you can't trust a con.

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:12.865
Once a criminal,
always a criminal.

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:21.350
As I looked at Anthony,
these words came back to me.

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:24.490
And I thought, how
many times had I

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.910
taken something
that wasn't mine?

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:31.210
Sure, I considered my
own criminality before.

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:33.690
But not like this.

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:36.770
I hadn't honestly
thought about what

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:42.210
life would be like in the
shadow of that criminal record,

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:47.810
under the stifling stigma
of having been caught.

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:52.210
What would life be like for
me if I didn't have the luxury

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:52.710
to forget?

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:59.310
For the past three years,
I've been traveling all

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:03.060
across the US asking
people like me,

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:07.040
the 75% of us that haven't
been caught-- those of us

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:12.730
with criminal histories but no
record-- that very question.

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:16.890
What if you had the
luxury to forget?

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:20.400
Today, I want to share with
you some of those stories.

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.850
Some will be petty,
some quite serious.

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:28.570
Some happened recently,
others decades ago.

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:31.270
I hope that through
this, I provide for you

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:34.820
another way of looking at
the true and disparate impact

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:36.450
of our criminal and
juvenile justice

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:39.950
systems on poor communities,
communities of color,

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:43.280
and American Indians
throughout the US.

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:48.480
But first, let's make sure
we're all on the same page.

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:50.580
This is a graph taken
from data from the Bureau

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:51.820
of Justice Statistics.

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:54.640
And it shows, as you can see,
the US State and Federal prison

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:58.160
population between
1925 and 2013.

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.770
Now barring for some
general population growth,

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:03.420
you can see that
the number of people

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:05.970
we put behind bars in
the US remained fairly

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:10.530
steady until about the 1970s.

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:13.480
More than four
decades ago, we began

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:17.390
this, the deliberate
and regrettable march

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:21.260
toward caging more
than 1.5 million people

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.210
across the United States.

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:28.770
Four decades of wars
on drugs, and poverty,

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:31.150
and mental illness,
three strikes policies,

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:33.530
mandatory minimums,
private prisons,

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:36.150
and concentrated policing
in minority communities

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:39.640
are just some of the policies
and practices that have led us

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:41.215
to this mass disaster.

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:47.660
What's doubly
concerning, I think,

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:52.150
is that even once people
are no longer locked up,

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:55.160
they find themselves
locked out--

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:59.400
locked out of jobs, employment
opportunities, housing,

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:03.080
and countless other ways to
move on and move up in life.

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:06.650
Now before I get into those
collateral consequences

00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:09.590
or the everlasting impact
of a criminal record

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:14.510
upon one's life, let's
turn back to the graph.

00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:17.580
As I said, this shows the
US State and Federal prison

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:19.570
population.

00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:23.640
But just as importantly
is what it doesn't show.

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:26.610
For example, it doesn't
show the millions

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:30.560
of people across the United
States who are in county jails.

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:33.380
It doesn't show those who
are in immigration holds,

00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:36.260
mental health holds, or the
kids in juvenile detention.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:39.179
They are not shown
here on this graph.

00:08:39.179 --> 00:08:41.059
It doesn't show the
millions of people

00:08:41.059 --> 00:08:45.032
who are on probation or parole,
their liberties curtailed

00:08:45.032 --> 00:08:46.990
under the thumb of the
criminal justice system,

00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:49.520
yet not spending
nights behind bars.

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:52.370
They are not shown
here on this graph.

00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:56.970
It doesn't show the estimated
65 to 100 million people

00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:59.440
in the United States who
have a criminal record, who

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:02.060
carry that legacy
of the interaction

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:03.800
with the criminal
justice system.

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:07.240
They are not shown
here on this graph.

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:09.510
And just as
importantly, it doesn't

00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:15.380
show the nearly three
million sons and daughters,

00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:18.840
the countless brothers and
sisters, mothers and fathers,

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:22.070
spouses and partners, and
greater community members who

00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:24.590
can all be profoundly
impacted when

00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:28.310
someone is taken out of the home
and then not allowed back in.

00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:32.000
They are not shown
here on this graph.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.560
And so what initially appears
to be a tsunami of humanity

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:40.470
ready to crash upon
our shores is really

00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:46.150
just a drop in the
greater ocean of a crisis.

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:48.120
This comes at no small cost.

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:51.140
The United States spends
approximately $80 billion

00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:54.370
a year locking people up.

00:09:54.370 --> 00:09:57.080
And that doesn't
even capture it all.

00:09:57.080 --> 00:10:01.600
There's a hidden cost, that
which communities spend

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:05.080
to house, train, counsel,
educate, treat and employ,

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:06.890
and otherwise
transition individuals

00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:09.060
who are leaving prison or jail.

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:12.140
And that is a burden that
falls disproportionately

00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:15.840
upon poor communities
and communities of color.

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:18.070
For example, across
the US, there

00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:21.560
are more than 12 million
arrests each year.

00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:25.380
80% of those individuals
who are arrested

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:28.130
are eligible for public defense.

00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:30.690
In some jurisdictions,
that means that you

00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:34.860
make less than $3,000 a year.

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:37.510
Can you fathom that?

00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:40.972
Not can you fathom that
that poverty exists.

00:10:40.972 --> 00:10:42.680
I think we're all
bright enough for that.

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:49.690
Can you personally fathom
living on $3,000 a year?

00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:53.350
That is a staggering
level of poverty.

00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:55.650
Likewise, communities of
color are disproportionately

00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:56.150
impacted.

00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:58.140
For example, the
lifetime likelihood

00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:02.250
of imprisonment for black
man is one in three.

00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:05.510
One in three.

00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:08.220
That shouldn't sit
well with any of us.

00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:10.230
Meanwhile, white
women such as myself

00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:14.630
benefit from a far greater
cushion of one in 111.

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:16.750
Now that is not to say
that white women have not

00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:17.900
committed crimes.

00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:19.930
But that's not who you
see, proportionately

00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:24.560
speaking, within our
criminal justice system.

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:26.840
Likewise, the
disparities start early.

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:29.770
For kids, for example, some
of the highest crime rates

00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:31.720
come from affluent teens.

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:35.830
And yet again, that's not who
you see in our juvenile justice

00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:36.770
system.

00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:41.210
And as a note--
for the children,

00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:43.410
for the youth, for the
young adults who do cycle

00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:44.910
through our juvenile
justice system,

00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:49.220
understand that that record
is no longer just tangible.

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:52.050
It's no longer something that
you can put through a shredder

00:11:52.050 --> 00:11:56.160
or actually destroy upon
completion of that interaction.

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:59.650
This Scarlet Letter is now
stamped upon the ether.

00:11:59.650 --> 00:12:03.540
And it is something that
no amount of scrubbing

00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:06.060
can come clean.

00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:08.680
Out of the juvenile world
and back into the adult.

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:12.050
According to the National
Employment Law Project--

00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:15.650
great people located right
here in your own backyard--

00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:19.090
say that one in four
individuals in the US

00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:20.320
has a criminal record.

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:23.100
According to the Bureau
of Justice Statistics,

00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:25.940
that number may be
closer to one in three.

00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:28.950
And those waters
just keep rising.

00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:32.190
Well how do records
affect people?

00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:33.720
Let's break it down.

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:36.210
These are just a few.

00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:38.900
For example, employment.

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:42.420
According to the Society for
Human Resources Management,

00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:46.150
somewhere between 87%
and 92% of employers

00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:48.720
conduct criminal history
checks on individuals

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:54.510
who are seeking to work at
that place of employment.

00:12:54.510 --> 00:12:57.380
Many of those result
in disqualifications

00:12:57.380 --> 00:13:01.300
if there is any mar on
one's record, regardless

00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:06.330
of the recency of offense, or
the severity of the offense,

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:11.210
or the relevance of the
offense to the job at hand.

00:13:11.210 --> 00:13:13.590
Safe and affordable
housing can be

00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:16.080
impacted by the presence
of a criminal record.

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:18.770
That's for both
public and private,

00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:22.870
which despite federal
efforts on the public end

00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:24.950
to make it more
accessible, there

00:13:24.950 --> 00:13:28.540
has been great resistance
among local housing authorities

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:31.070
to follow through.

00:13:31.070 --> 00:13:31.710
Licensure.

00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:35.420
Everything from practicing
law to emptying a bedpan

00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:39.690
can be impacted by the
presence of a criminal record.

00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:42.220
The ability to receive
government assistance

00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:43.010
or benefits.

00:13:43.010 --> 00:13:45.940
So if there's no
other way, lawful way,

00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:49.450
of putting food in your belly
or a roof over your head,

00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:52.510
we've cut that off as well.

00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:53.670
Education.

00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:55.810
Let's break this one down.

00:13:55.810 --> 00:13:57.900
The Common Application
Form, the form

00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:03.460
that's used by more than 500
colleges and universities

00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:07.300
nationwide to determine
the makeup of next year's

00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:10.990
new admissions, it
asks the question,

00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:13.460
have you ever been
convicted or adjudicated

00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:15.790
delinquent of an offense?

00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:19.250
Yes or no?

00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:22.810
Can you imagine your
ability to access education

00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:25.480
limited to a checked box?

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:28.994
Yes or no?

00:14:28.994 --> 00:14:30.660
And while some schools
may say that that

00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:34.170
is just one variable in
a much larger algorithm,

00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:36.500
make no mistake
the chilling effect

00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:40.190
that that question has on
individuals with records.

00:14:40.190 --> 00:14:46.940
Because unlike employment,
here it's $20, $30, $50, $60.

00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:49.260
You have to pay to be denied.

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:53.940
You have to pay just to be told
that you're not a good fit.

00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:56.850
This at a time when there is
no social science research that

00:14:56.850 --> 00:15:02.830
shows any bearing of
past criminal activity

00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:04.740
on future campus safety.

00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:07.440
And at a time when
countless research shows

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:10.610
us that access to
education can be

00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:14.160
one of the greatest determining
factors in a reduced recidivism

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:14.760
rate.

00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:17.980
We should be pushing kids
into school at a time

00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:21.140
when we're locking them out.

00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:23.800
Immigration-- the ability
both to stay in the US

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:26.320
and to petition
family to join can

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:29.360
be impacted by the presence
of a criminal record.

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:31.440
The ability to travel.

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:34.730
When I was working at the
Council on Crime and Justice,

00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:40.370
a nonprofit in Minnesota, we had
a woman come into the office.

00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:44.670
Several years before, she had
been a member of the Red Hat

00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:46.100
Society.

00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:49.050
For those of you who don't
know, the Red Hat Society

00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:53.590
is something of a social group,
a membership organization

00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:56.300
across the US,
comprised primarily

00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:59.390
of women over the age of 55.

00:15:59.390 --> 00:16:01.030
It's a social group.

00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:03.760
They do lunches and
brunches together.

00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:06.140
They have book
clubs and debates.

00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:07.237
They volunteer together.

00:16:07.237 --> 00:16:08.570
They go to the theater together.

00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:11.000
And every now and then,
they charter a bus

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.660
and go to Canada together.

00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:17.170
That's what this particular
chapter had done.

00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:21.570
They got up to the border
and patrol came on and said,

00:16:21.570 --> 00:16:24.660
I need to run
everyone's background.

00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:26.630
The women all
dutifully handed over

00:16:26.630 --> 00:16:29.450
their IDs, thinking
nothing of it.

00:16:29.450 --> 00:16:32.970
Some time later,
patrol came back on.

00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:37.110
Walking down the aisle,
he said, you shall pass.

00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:38.590
You shall pass.

00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:40.280
You shall pass.

00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:43.010
You shall not.

00:16:43.010 --> 00:16:46.680
You see, three decades
ago, this woman

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:49.820
had been accused of an offense.

00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:53.190
She was never charged
much less convicted.

00:16:53.190 --> 00:16:59.150
But that arrest was enough to
bar her entry into the country.

00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:02.820
Her sisterhood
said, see you later.

00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:06.294
And they dropped her
off at a gas station.

00:17:09.619 --> 00:17:13.010
Did I mention that she's
in a mobility chair?

00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:16.630
So here's this woman, wearing
her red hat and purple jacket,

00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:20.510
as they all do in this society,
and in her mobility chair.

00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:24.270
At a payphone, calling back
home to have money wired up so

00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:26.109
she can return.

00:17:26.109 --> 00:17:28.180
And she said that
wasn't the worst part.

00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:30.310
I mean, that sounds
pretty miserable.

00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:35.000
She said the worst part
was as the bus was leaving,

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.920
one of her sisters put
down a window and said,

00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:42.725
I thought I knew who you were.

00:17:42.725 --> 00:17:47.030
As if what had allegedly
occurred more than 30 years ago

00:17:47.030 --> 00:17:50.500
was the full sum of
this woman's character.

00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:54.570
Not those lunches, not those
brunches, not those book clubs,

00:17:54.570 --> 00:17:57.060
not those debates, not
the countless times

00:17:57.060 --> 00:17:59.400
that they had volunteered
together or gone to theater

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:02.010
together, not even
the 4.5 hours it

00:18:02.010 --> 00:18:04.310
took to take that
bus up to the border.

00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:05.530
None of that mattered.

00:18:05.530 --> 00:18:11.190
Suddenly she was reduced
to a single moment in time.

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:13.680
And as preposterous
as that sounds-- and I

00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:16.340
think it sounds
pretty ridiculous--

00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:20.230
consider how often we do that.

00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:24.620
How often we think we
know who someone is,

00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:28.060
how often a single moment
in time, a criminal record,

00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:30.520
or something found
through a Google search,

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:33.400
can eclipse every other
aspect of that person.

00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:38.960
Voting-- the ability to
partake in the civic process

00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:41.419
is also impacted in many
states across the nation

00:18:41.419 --> 00:18:42.960
by the presence of
a criminal record.

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:46.730
So it's nearly every
aspect of who we are

00:18:46.730 --> 00:18:50.690
and how we are from
personal to professional,

00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:55.060
from psychological to social.

00:18:55.060 --> 00:19:00.470
How we exist in the world
is confined and defined

00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:02.011
by our criminal histories.

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:05.582
But not for everyone.

00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:12.440
In fact, just for a few of us.

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:16.970
Just for one in
four of us, right?

00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:20.200
What about the other 75%?

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:23.060
Those of us who have committed
crimes but not been caught.

00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:28.590
I wanted to know if
anybody would join me

00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:31.990
in this little experiment of
considering what life would be

00:19:31.990 --> 00:19:35.860
like had we been burdened with
a constant reminder of what

00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:37.880
we had once done.

00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:41.060
So I drew up a flyer that
said, we are all criminals.

00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:43.610
What if you had the
luxury to forget?

00:19:43.610 --> 00:19:46.520
And I left my
contact information.

00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:48.810
I sent it out to our
social service network

00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:50.650
when I was working
at the nonprofit.

00:19:50.650 --> 00:19:53.340
But I asked our
network not to respond.

00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:56.490
I didn't want to hear from
people that I already knew.

00:19:56.490 --> 00:20:00.410
Instead, I asked them to
forward it on to their friends,

00:20:00.410 --> 00:20:03.280
to their coffee clubs,
and church groups,

00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:06.050
and neighborhood orgs.

00:20:06.050 --> 00:20:12.490
To my unending surprise, the
phone actually started to ring.

00:20:12.490 --> 00:20:15.630
So I bought a camera
and a recorder.

00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:19.620
I hopped in my hatchback, and
I drove all across the state.

00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:22.180
And now all across
the United States,

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:26.320
interviewing people in
bars and in cars, in diners

00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:28.030
and on boats, anywhere
where somebody

00:20:28.030 --> 00:20:30.264
might feel comfortable
enough to disclose to me

00:20:30.264 --> 00:20:31.680
something that
they have otherwise

00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:35.200
had the luxury to forget.

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:40.400
I then took pictures of the
participants, or mug shots,

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:41.390
if you will.

00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:46.140
In a way that I hope
relays an individuality,

00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:50.220
and a personality, and
perhaps even a little humanity

00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:53.020
without, of course, identity.

00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:57.410
And you can find the first
80 of the more than 250

00:20:57.410 --> 00:20:59.289
of those interviews
on the website

00:20:59.289 --> 00:21:00.330
at weareallcriminals.org.

00:21:02.790 --> 00:21:05.370
If you go on the site-- and I
would encourage you to do sp--

00:21:05.370 --> 00:21:08.750
you'll note that if
you tap a photo once,

00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:13.160
you'll see how the person
is introduced in the world--

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:18.320
as a lawyer or a doctor, as a
legislator or a peace officer.

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:21.990
But then you will see after that
how they would be introduced

00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:28.460
had they been caught-- assault,
sale of controlled substances,

00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:29.720
theft.

00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:33.590
If you click twice,
you'll go into the story.

00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:36.480
And here you will
find a wide range

00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:39.730
in the severity of
offenses, from quite serious

00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:43.320
like aggravated robbery,
to relatively innocuous.

00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:45.760
Open bottle that was
carrying from one house

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:47.200
party to the next.

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:50.240
Petty theft that was failure
to return a library book.

00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:52.260
That is an offense, by the way.

00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:55.480
The next one down
was public urination.

00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:58.210
This gentleman
now has a contract

00:21:58.210 --> 00:22:00.230
to work with the
Department of Defense,

00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:03.750
some of the highest security
clearance in the nation.

00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:06.400
Had he been caught, he
would find difficulty

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:08.850
getting a job at a gas station.

00:22:08.850 --> 00:22:10.660
I know, because
many of my clients

00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:17.500
with very similar records
faced that refusal.

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:22.070
You'll also find a wide
range in the responses

00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:25.160
to the recollection of
past transgressions.

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:27.590
For example, this
gentleman, when

00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:31.000
recalling a time that he had
taken his uncle's hunting

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.620
rifle out to
college with him, he

00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:36.780
said that one drunken
shot went right

00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:38.720
through the locking
mechanism of a double

00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:43.000
posted parking meter, letting
loose $40 worth of quarters.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.070
He calls it his $40
shot, by the way.

00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:50.010
And he laughed throughout
the entire interview.

00:22:50.010 --> 00:22:52.900
Other people wept
throughout theirs.

00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:54.950
Like this woman
who recalled a time

00:22:54.950 --> 00:22:57.940
that she would pad her tips
with bills from the till.

00:22:57.940 --> 00:22:59.850
She was working as
a barista and felt

00:22:59.850 --> 00:23:02.580
that she was under appreciated.

00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:05.790
As she told me this, tears of
shame streamed down her face.

00:23:05.790 --> 00:23:08.570
She said, I can't imagine
where I would be now

00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:10.891
had I been caught then.

00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:16.140
Many people recognize
that crime was

00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:20.620
an event in their life course,
not a static characteristic

00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:23.900
of who they are.

00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:27.680
And some stories were
truly heartbreaking.

00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:29.890
At least for me they are.

00:23:29.890 --> 00:23:32.280
You can read the full
story, for example,

00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:37.330
of the gentleman for whom I
took this photograph online.

00:23:37.330 --> 00:23:41.490
But I can give you the
abridged version now.

00:23:41.490 --> 00:23:46.980
When he was just 15, his family
moved to a rougher neighborhood

00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:48.720
than they had been in before.

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:52.390
And the neighborhood before
it was already rough enough.

00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:55.890
He said the first few
weeks, he was mugged

00:23:55.890 --> 00:23:58.800
and beaten several times.

00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:01.760
But after a while,
he noticed that when

00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:07.030
he hung around a certain group
of guys, the beating stopped.

00:24:07.030 --> 00:24:11.760
So he did what perhaps many
a logical person would do,

00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:14.610
and he joined the gang.

00:24:14.610 --> 00:24:16.780
Now that didn't come for free.

00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:19.650
And the price was exacted
one regrettable Saturday

00:24:19.650 --> 00:24:25.720
day when he was told that if
he didn't pick up a lead pipe

00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:29.460
and hit a child that
looked a lot like him,

00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:33.140
a member of a rival
gang, that he himself

00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:36.640
would be the one beaten.

00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:38.260
He made the decision
he said that he

00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:40.360
has regretted every day since.

00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:42.400
In fact now, even
decades later, he

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:45.390
says he wakes up at
least once a month

00:24:45.390 --> 00:24:47.390
in the middle of the
night, screaming, thinking

00:24:47.390 --> 00:24:50.550
that it's all happening again.

00:24:50.550 --> 00:24:53.773
He picked up that pipe
and he hit that child.

00:24:57.030 --> 00:25:00.780
Had he been caught,
he would've been

00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:02.320
charged with first
degree assault

00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:03.900
for the benefit of a gang.

00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:06.560
He would have been certified to
stand trial as an adult, where

00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:08.610
he would have been convicted.

00:25:08.610 --> 00:25:10.730
Once convicted, he would
have entered the system,

00:25:10.730 --> 00:25:13.220
eventually finding himself
in prison then out of prison,

00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:16.200
in prison out of prison,
in prison out of prison--

00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:18.250
that cycle that
happens to millions

00:25:18.250 --> 00:25:21.960
of people across the US.

00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:24.690
He wasn't caught.

00:25:24.690 --> 00:25:26.780
He graduated from high school.

00:25:26.780 --> 00:25:29.260
He got a scholarship
to go to college,

00:25:29.260 --> 00:25:31.520
where he said that for the
first time in his life,

00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:34.530
he was able to read
an entire paragraph.

00:25:34.530 --> 00:25:36.280
He could complete
a math problem,

00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:39.270
because for the first time, he
wasn't constantly checking over

00:25:39.270 --> 00:25:41.970
his shoulder to see
what was coming next.

00:25:41.970 --> 00:25:43.630
He could concentrate.

00:25:43.630 --> 00:25:45.660
He was safe.

00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:48.440
His grades skyrocketed.

00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:50.970
He graduated undergrad,
went on to graduate school,

00:25:50.970 --> 00:25:55.250
and now has a Ph.D.
in biophysics.

00:25:55.250 --> 00:25:58.390
Am I saying that that would be
impossible had he been caught?

00:25:58.390 --> 00:26:00.150
No.

00:26:00.150 --> 00:26:02.500
But let's break it down.

00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:04.910
He wouldn't have
graduated on time.

00:26:04.910 --> 00:26:07.436
He likely wouldn't have
gotten that scholarship.

00:26:07.436 --> 00:26:08.810
Applying at that
school, he would

00:26:08.810 --> 00:26:10.920
have had to check that
box saying that he had

00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:12.500
been convicted of an offense.

00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:14.540
And chances are, he would
be told that he's not

00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:16.310
a very good character fit.

00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:21.150
Even if he had passed all of
those barriers, once in school,

00:26:21.150 --> 00:26:24.450
trying to find jobs
or internships,

00:26:24.450 --> 00:26:28.210
after school, finding more
employment and promotions,

00:26:28.210 --> 00:26:29.840
and any of the
other opportunities

00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:32.060
that he's had in
life all likely would

00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:34.020
have been met with
that question--

00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:37.170
have you ever been
convicted of an offense?

00:26:37.170 --> 00:26:38.550
Yes or no?

00:26:38.550 --> 00:26:40.440
And he would have answered yes.

00:26:43.370 --> 00:26:47.370
Now by no means am I suggesting
that we should somehow

00:26:47.370 --> 00:26:50.990
forget the harm that
occurs across the US,

00:26:50.990 --> 00:26:55.000
that we should somehow pretend
that people aren't victimized.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:58.160
They absolutely are.

00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:02.340
What I'm asking is that
when we construct responses

00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:08.440
to that harm, when we
construct those consequences,

00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:10.690
that they be
reasonable, that they

00:27:10.690 --> 00:27:14.580
be rational, that
they be proportionate,

00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:16.900
that they be merciful.

00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:22.350
And above all else, that there
be an end to that punishment.

00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:25.510
Because without hope,
what does one have?

00:27:28.552 --> 00:27:30.010
Time and again, I
heard from people

00:27:30.010 --> 00:27:32.130
that said that they engaged
in criminal activity

00:27:32.130 --> 00:27:33.520
so that they could
feel like they

00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:34.850
were part of a social circle.

00:27:34.850 --> 00:27:37.870
Like this gentleman who
donated some of his FAFSA funds

00:27:37.870 --> 00:27:40.630
to help finance a drug
ring or this woman

00:27:40.630 --> 00:27:43.155
who sold weed to frat
bros and football players

00:27:43.155 --> 00:27:45.980
so that she could get a hey,
what's up, in the hallway.

00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:48.288
She said she was sick
of feeling invisible.

00:27:51.010 --> 00:27:53.230
And then there are some
that just can't quite

00:27:53.230 --> 00:27:55.450
get their heads around
where they would be now

00:27:55.450 --> 00:27:58.320
had they been caught then.

00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:01.300
Like the woman for whom
I took this photograph.

00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:03.780
When she was 16
years old, she said

00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:06.820
she was a bit of a
nerd, a chemistry buff.

00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:11.070
One bored July day, she and
some of her nerd friends

00:28:11.070 --> 00:28:14.047
decided that they would make
their own homemade napalm,

00:28:14.047 --> 00:28:16.630
which you can do with just a few
common household ingredients,

00:28:16.630 --> 00:28:17.900
by the way.

00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:20.640
They put this in an
apple cider glass jar,

00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:23.150
let it sit overnight,
and then took it out

00:28:23.150 --> 00:28:27.210
to a state park where they
found the small, ideal, enclosed

00:28:27.210 --> 00:28:30.800
space upon which they
could test their substance.

00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:33.960
They doused the inside
of the porta potty

00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:37.550
with this highly
flammable, viscous gel.

00:28:37.550 --> 00:28:40.960
They lit a tennis ball
on, fire lobbed it in,

00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:43.240
and watched it blow.

00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:45.180
They then ran back to
their cars and drove

00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:48.050
the speed limit the entire
way home, terrified over what

00:28:48.050 --> 00:28:50.680
had just happened.

00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:53.300
The day that I
interviewed her, she

00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:56.150
had been keeping a
three-month-old heart alive

00:28:56.150 --> 00:29:02.110
with her index finger,
beating it for the baby.

00:29:02.110 --> 00:29:04.920
She's a pediatrician.

00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:07.830
In her state and in
many others, that

00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:12.030
would have been an impossibility
had she been caught.

00:29:12.030 --> 00:29:15.610
She would have faced
a lifetime barrier

00:29:15.610 --> 00:29:17.760
to working with vulnerable
individuals, most

00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:21.260
definitely youth.

00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:23.950
It gives you pause,
doesn't it-- or at least I

00:29:23.950 --> 00:29:29.060
think it should-- when you
consider all of the waste

00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:34.850
across the US, all of
those foreclosed futures

00:29:34.850 --> 00:29:36.485
before brains are
even fully developed.

00:29:40.290 --> 00:29:44.120
And then there are some stories
that I heard that I honestly

00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:48.400
can't believe we're still
talking about in 2015-- not

00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:53.740
every state, but--
this woman told me

00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:56.630
about a time a few years ago.

00:29:56.630 --> 00:30:03.490
Her husband had been diagnosed
with a form of cancer that was,

00:30:03.490 --> 00:30:07.960
it was debilitating,
as well as terminal.

00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:12.100
She said that in the last
few months of his life,

00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:16.170
his body was so
crippled with pain

00:30:16.170 --> 00:30:21.310
that he couldn't pick up a
pencil or shampoo his own hair.

00:30:21.310 --> 00:30:25.220
This man who had been an active
marine just the year before,

00:30:25.220 --> 00:30:28.940
ostensibly at the peak of
his physical career, now

00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:32.680
couldn't even bathe himself.

00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:34.510
She said the only
thing that could

00:30:34.510 --> 00:30:38.230
assuage that pain was pot.

00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:40.400
Now she had asthma so
he couldn't smoke it.

00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:43.450
So instead, she put the pot
in the butter and the butter

00:30:43.450 --> 00:30:44.140
in the brownies.

00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:47.070
And together, they would eat it.

00:30:47.070 --> 00:30:51.590
She said that when they
did, for just a few moments,

00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:56.405
he could relax his hand
enough to hold hers.

00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:01.520
He died.

00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:04.250
Her life stopped.

00:31:04.250 --> 00:31:06.890
She said that she
doesn't remember

00:31:06.890 --> 00:31:09.610
what she did with the pot.

00:31:09.610 --> 00:31:10.760
Maybe she used it.

00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:12.150
She doesn't think so.

00:31:12.150 --> 00:31:13.330
Maybe her friends did.

00:31:13.330 --> 00:31:15.660
That's more likely, she said.

00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:16.800
Maybe she threw it away.

00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:18.330
It didn't matter.

00:31:18.330 --> 00:31:23.170
The point was her
husband had just died.

00:31:23.170 --> 00:31:26.860
She said, is that something
you think you can use?

00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:30.630
And I told her about a
phone call I had received.

00:31:30.630 --> 00:31:36.010
There was a woman who, a few
years before, had been living

00:31:36.010 --> 00:31:39.520
with her only son, a
man in his mid-40's

00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:44.040
when he was diagnosed
with a particularly

00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:47.760
aggressive and terminal
form of cancer.

00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:50.220
In the last few
months of his life,

00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:55.390
the only thing that could
assuage his pain was pot.

00:31:55.390 --> 00:31:57.740
Now she didn't have asthma,
so he straight up smoked it.

00:31:57.740 --> 00:32:02.060
And when he did, she said, it's
like her baby was back with her

00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:02.560
again.

00:32:05.630 --> 00:32:07.690
He died.

00:32:07.690 --> 00:32:10.720
Her life stopped.

00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:13.360
She said she doesn't remember.

00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:17.150
She said that she
didn't throw his work

00:32:17.150 --> 00:32:21.920
boots from the back
door or his toothbrush

00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:25.090
from the bathroom sink.

00:32:25.090 --> 00:32:29.131
And she didn't toss
the baggies of pot

00:32:29.131 --> 00:32:30.172
that were in the freezer.

00:32:33.970 --> 00:32:38.480
A few months went by and
police executed a warrant

00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:39.730
on her home, a search warrant.

00:32:39.730 --> 00:32:43.080
There'd been accusations that
she was warehousing drugs.

00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:46.170
They tore apart her place
and found the marijuana

00:32:46.170 --> 00:32:48.270
in the freezer.

00:32:48.270 --> 00:32:52.583
She was charged and convicted
with a felony possession

00:32:52.583 --> 00:32:53.624
of controlled substances.

00:32:56.470 --> 00:32:58.790
She was living in
public housing, which

00:32:58.790 --> 00:33:04.500
means one strike, no
fault, and you're out.

00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:07.830
This woman is 72 years old.

00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:11.379
She has no prior
criminal record and she's

00:33:11.379 --> 00:33:12.295
living on the streets.

00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:17.070
We talked about the cost.

00:33:17.070 --> 00:33:19.460
And we talked about
the hidden cost.

00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:22.980
This is the human cost.

00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:26.310
We Are All Criminals seeks
to remind viewers and readers

00:33:26.310 --> 00:33:29.070
that while we have all done
something that we're not proud

00:33:29.070 --> 00:33:34.530
of, each and every one of
us, we're also all human.

00:33:34.530 --> 00:33:38.000
And some of us may be in
need of a second chance.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:39.480
But make no mistake.

00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:42.820
This is also a commentary
on the disparate impact

00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:46.480
of our nation's policies,
policing, and prosecution.

00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:48.800
Many-- not all-- but
many of the participants

00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:51.800
have benefited from belonging
to a race and class that

00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:56.150
is not overrepresented in
our criminal justice system.

00:33:56.150 --> 00:33:58.607
And some people have been
pretty straight up about that.

00:34:01.810 --> 00:34:05.070
Others are still
trying to figure out

00:34:05.070 --> 00:34:11.010
what it means to be a criminal,
like the gentleman for whom

00:34:11.010 --> 00:34:13.510
I took this photograph.

00:34:13.510 --> 00:34:15.960
Remember I said I
sent the flyer out

00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:18.540
and the flyer was forwarded on?

00:34:18.540 --> 00:34:22.770
By the time it got to this
man, it was maybe five times

00:34:22.770 --> 00:34:26.540
removed, which meant
that he had no context

00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:30.170
for the conversation,
much less the project.

00:34:30.170 --> 00:34:34.510
He said that when he got that
flyer, he was pissed off.

00:34:34.510 --> 00:34:36.630
He couldn't believe that
some punk in the city

00:34:36.630 --> 00:34:38.449
was calling him a
criminal just because he

00:34:38.449 --> 00:34:40.639
was a member of the human race.

00:34:40.639 --> 00:34:43.260
He said that for three weeks,
he would pick up his phone

00:34:43.260 --> 00:34:45.199
and dial all but my
last digit, wanting

00:34:45.199 --> 00:34:47.820
to call me up and ream me out.

00:34:47.820 --> 00:34:51.909
When he finally did
punch that last number,

00:34:51.909 --> 00:34:56.340
it was not to complain,
but to participate.

00:34:56.340 --> 00:35:00.030
You see, he recalled
that he used to run drugs

00:35:00.030 --> 00:35:02.810
across Lake Superior.

00:35:02.810 --> 00:35:07.002
How do you forget
something like that?

00:35:07.002 --> 00:35:08.460
You forget something
like that when

00:35:08.460 --> 00:35:10.210
you think of drug
trafficking as something

00:35:10.210 --> 00:35:12.690
that happens between strangers
in darkened alleyways,

00:35:12.690 --> 00:35:17.140
not something that happens
between college friends.

00:35:17.140 --> 00:35:21.310
You see, his freshman year,
he had left his home town,

00:35:21.310 --> 00:35:25.220
went across the lake and went
to a small private school.

00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:27.470
His sophomore year,
he transferred back

00:35:27.470 --> 00:35:30.890
to his hometown and
moved in with some

00:35:30.890 --> 00:35:33.170
of his old high school
friends, who it turns out

00:35:33.170 --> 00:35:35.050
were no longer
just smoking dope.

00:35:35.050 --> 00:35:36.700
Now they were selling it.

00:35:36.700 --> 00:35:40.410
And he was the ideal conduit
to the untapped market

00:35:40.410 --> 00:35:43.560
across those stormy
waters, because he knew who

00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:45.090
the legitimate smokers were.

00:35:45.090 --> 00:35:47.810
He knew who the
potential narcs were.

00:35:47.810 --> 00:35:51.200
So he said, they
trained me in on phones.

00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:52.860
I would take the drugs.

00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:54.770
I would often take the money.

00:35:54.770 --> 00:35:57.600
But really, do you think
that I did anything

00:35:57.600 --> 00:36:00.350
that would rise to the
level of something criminal,

00:36:00.350 --> 00:36:02.190
he asked me?

00:36:02.190 --> 00:36:04.840
Right?

00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:05.740
Yeah.

00:36:05.740 --> 00:36:07.190
Yeah, I do, in fact.

00:36:07.190 --> 00:36:08.170
State.

00:36:08.170 --> 00:36:08.840
Federal.

00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:09.810
Not just criminal.

00:36:09.810 --> 00:36:10.980
Felonious.

00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:13.130
And at that, he
began to fall apart.

00:36:13.130 --> 00:36:14.880
He said, OK wait a minute.

00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:19.419
So had I been caught, I
wouldn't have graduated college.

00:36:19.419 --> 00:36:20.960
If I wouldn't have
graduated college,

00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:22.793
I wouldn't have gotten
that first internship

00:36:22.793 --> 00:36:24.640
where I met my wife.

00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:26.470
If I wouldn't have
met my wife, I

00:36:26.470 --> 00:36:29.100
wouldn't now have my two sons.

00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:29.710
OK.

00:36:29.710 --> 00:36:31.900
Let's say that by some
cosmic confluence,

00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:33.540
I did still meet my wife.

00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:35.790
I still did have my two sons.

00:36:35.790 --> 00:36:39.040
What kind of father
would I be, he asked me.

00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:40.970
For example, every
year he fills out

00:36:40.970 --> 00:36:44.550
an application to volunteer with
his son's hockey league teams.

00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:47.130
And every year, it
asks the question,

00:36:47.130 --> 00:36:50.700
have you ever been convicted
of-- and then lists

00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:52.470
10 offenses.

00:36:52.470 --> 00:36:56.390
And every year, he blithely
checks no, no, no, no, no, no,

00:36:56.390 --> 00:36:58.730
no.

00:36:58.730 --> 00:37:01.750
He said if instead
they were to ask,

00:37:01.750 --> 00:37:05.390
have you ever committed
any of the following,

00:37:05.390 --> 00:37:08.060
he doesn't know how
he would answer.

00:37:08.060 --> 00:37:13.410
And had he been caught, he
doesn't know what he would do.

00:37:13.410 --> 00:37:15.390
He said, I would
have three options.

00:37:15.390 --> 00:37:18.110
Number one, I could just lie.

00:37:18.110 --> 00:37:19.660
I could say no.

00:37:19.660 --> 00:37:22.250
This is a man who nearly
got an ulcer from a flyer.

00:37:22.250 --> 00:37:24.130
Dude is not about to lie.

00:37:24.130 --> 00:37:26.990
If somebody were to
Google him and find out

00:37:26.990 --> 00:37:28.536
that he had a
criminal record, he

00:37:28.536 --> 00:37:29.910
wouldn't be able
to deal with it.

00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:32.080
So that was off the table.

00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:38.270
Number two, he said, I
could say yes, will explain.

00:37:38.270 --> 00:37:39.880
This man is a business owner.

00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:43.810
And for the past
10 years, any time

00:37:43.810 --> 00:37:46.620
that question was answered
in the affirmative,

00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:48.180
he would trash the app.

00:37:48.180 --> 00:37:50.580
He said he didn't want
to work with a criminal.

00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:58.390
Even if he did explain, he
said he knows how parents are.

00:37:58.390 --> 00:38:02.300
He understands that the stigma
wouldn't just stick with him,

00:38:02.300 --> 00:38:05.200
but would run down
to his sons as well.

00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:07.520
And he wouldn't do
anything to harm them.

00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:09.360
So that was off the table.

00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:13.600
He would only have one option
left-- option number three.

00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:17.740
He could just not respond.

00:38:17.740 --> 00:38:19.930
He could just take himself out.

00:38:22.860 --> 00:38:24.930
I can't tell you
how many people I've

00:38:24.930 --> 00:38:30.980
worked with that have just
stopped responding, because you

00:38:30.980 --> 00:38:33.350
can only get that door
slammed in your face

00:38:33.350 --> 00:38:36.010
so many times before
you say, enough.

00:38:38.770 --> 00:38:41.810
Now by no means am I
saying that individuals

00:38:41.810 --> 00:38:44.970
with criminal records
can't be amazing fathers.

00:38:44.970 --> 00:38:46.880
They absolutely can.

00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:50.440
Mothers, sisters,
mentors, and leaders.

00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:54.730
What I am saying is that
for the 75% of us who do not

00:38:54.730 --> 00:38:59.080
have a criminal record,
we're constructing barriers

00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:02.170
to keep out the 25% who do.

00:39:02.170 --> 00:39:04.740
And oftentimes, we don't
even realize we're doing it.

00:39:08.350 --> 00:39:11.250
So here's what I hope.

00:39:11.250 --> 00:39:14.500
I hope that you see a bit
of yourself in the photos

00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:17.360
and in the stories.

00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:22.140
I hope that in that reflection,
you take note of the context

00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:24.040
that you've allowed yourself.

00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:25.530
I was young.

00:39:25.530 --> 00:39:26.940
I was drunk.

00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:28.830
I was stupid.

00:39:28.830 --> 00:39:30.400
I was in a bad relationship.

00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:31.880
I gave it back anyway.

00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:33.310
No one got hurt.

00:39:33.310 --> 00:39:35.540
It wasn't my idea.

00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:38.290
Whatever that
context is, recognize

00:39:38.290 --> 00:39:42.890
that it may have existed for
someone who was caught as well.

00:39:42.890 --> 00:39:46.950
Now it may not be an excuse,
but it is an opportunity

00:39:46.950 --> 00:39:48.767
to recognize a common humanity.

00:39:51.690 --> 00:39:54.360
I hope that you
recognize the privilege

00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:57.430
that you may have
experienced, and appreciate

00:39:57.430 --> 00:40:01.980
that not everyone has benefited
from that same privilege.

00:40:01.980 --> 00:40:05.570
I hope that you reflect upon
how very patently different

00:40:05.570 --> 00:40:09.750
your own life could have
been had you been caught,

00:40:09.750 --> 00:40:11.920
and consider those
foreclosed futures

00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:14.590
of all of those who have been.

00:40:14.590 --> 00:40:21.640
Finally, I hope that it
inspires you to take action.

00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:26.870
There are many ways, countless
ways that you can get involved.

00:40:26.870 --> 00:40:33.280
Here at Google, you can
adopt fair hiring practices.

00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:36.790
And demand as much from your
contractors and vendors.

00:40:36.790 --> 00:40:41.770
The contractors and vendors
oftentimes say that they must

00:40:41.770 --> 00:40:45.620
bend to the will of their
clients and cannot adopt fair

00:40:45.620 --> 00:40:47.300
hiring practices.

00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:51.660
However, if the client demands
it, that's a different story.

00:40:51.660 --> 00:40:55.570
But more than that,
more than just passively

00:40:55.570 --> 00:40:58.630
accepting people with
criminal records,

00:40:58.630 --> 00:41:00.960
you have the opportunity
to be leaders

00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:05.580
in this field-- leaders in
the field of second chances

00:41:05.580 --> 00:41:09.210
by actively partnering
with organizations

00:41:09.210 --> 00:41:12.090
that work with individuals who
are coming out of the system.

00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:24.050
Externally, Google has become
the place that many of us

00:41:24.050 --> 00:41:29.450
turn to first when we want
to know more about somebody.

00:41:29.450 --> 00:41:33.050
I would encourage
you to consider

00:41:33.050 --> 00:41:37.560
what that means for individuals
who have criminal records.

00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:40.060
And I would ask that
you think creatively

00:41:40.060 --> 00:41:45.050
about a way in which
you can help create

00:41:45.050 --> 00:41:48.020
the space or the ability
for people to reclaim

00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:50.150
their narratives online.

00:41:50.150 --> 00:41:53.000
So that the only information,
or the first information

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:57.510
that comes up about somebody
isn't something that is perhaps

00:41:57.510 --> 00:42:03.070
outdated, holds no relevance,
and oftentimes is incorrect.

00:42:03.070 --> 00:42:06.970
But more than that, there are
firms that people with means

00:42:06.970 --> 00:42:09.960
can pay tens or hundreds
of thousands of dollars

00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:14.320
to to help them recreate
their narrative online,

00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:17.260
to help them reclaim
their stories.

00:42:17.260 --> 00:42:19.950
But for the vast
majority of people

00:42:19.950 --> 00:42:24.390
who are impacted by our criminal
and juvenile justice systems,

00:42:24.390 --> 00:42:26.900
that's not a possibility.

00:42:26.900 --> 00:42:30.120
I would ask that you
think about what Google

00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:37.430
can do to help solve
that, because this isn't

00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:40.470
going to happen on its own.

00:42:40.470 --> 00:42:45.970
Now here's the good news--
we're not alone in this.

00:42:45.970 --> 00:42:50.205
Across the US, there's a sea
change in criminal justice.

00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:56.530
Political leaders from across
the spectrum-- faith leaders,

00:42:56.530 --> 00:43:00.930
business leaders, even Sesame
Street-- is getting involved,

00:43:00.930 --> 00:43:05.465
is weighing in, standing
up and saying, enough.

00:43:08.580 --> 00:43:12.600
But without a
radical reimagining

00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:16.450
of our criminal and
juvenile justice systems,

00:43:16.450 --> 00:43:21.180
that can just be a
Band-Aid on cancer.

00:43:21.180 --> 00:43:27.870
I'd argue that the first
step in that reimagining

00:43:27.870 --> 00:43:33.800
is challenging the narrative of
clean versus criminal, of good

00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:37.580
versus bad, of us versus them.

00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:46.730
And so I'd ask
that you start now

00:43:46.730 --> 00:43:51.660
to think about what
your own story would be,

00:43:51.660 --> 00:43:57.830
to think about what you've
had the luxury to forget,

00:43:57.830 --> 00:44:00.976
to consider what your
chalkboard would say.

00:44:06.220 --> 00:44:11.190
What if a Google search
on you didn't pull up

00:44:11.190 --> 00:44:17.850
your carefully curated Facebook
pics, or your LinkedIn profile

00:44:17.850 --> 00:44:24.590
page, or your marathon
results, or your charity drive?

00:44:24.590 --> 00:44:29.840
What if instead it
pulled up your mug shot?

00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:31.721
How different would
life be for you?

00:44:34.810 --> 00:44:40.740
I think that once you
can truly appreciate

00:44:40.740 --> 00:44:46.750
that we are all criminals, I
think then you can appreciate

00:44:46.750 --> 00:44:48.790
that we're all human.

00:44:48.790 --> 00:44:52.280
And some of us, perhaps
one in four of us,

00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:53.915
may be in need of
a second chance.

00:44:57.200 --> 00:45:02.810
We Are All Criminals is a
call for reason, and equity,

00:45:02.810 --> 00:45:08.690
and mercy, and acknowledged
ownership in the problem as

00:45:08.690 --> 00:45:10.250
well as the solution.

00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:19.670
So that soon when Anthony
opens that sheet of paper,

00:45:19.670 --> 00:45:25.290
the page that's used to
define his character,

00:45:25.290 --> 00:45:36.010
he finds not thief, but father,
caregiver, nurse, speaker

00:45:36.010 --> 00:45:39.270
of six languages,
survivor of genocide,

00:45:39.270 --> 00:45:42.980
volunteer coach,
and avid reader.

00:45:42.980 --> 00:45:49.340
A man not defined by his worst
moment, but by his true worth.

00:45:49.340 --> 00:45:55.580
With the luxury to forget and
the opportunity to be forgiven,

00:45:55.580 --> 00:46:00.860
a man not tethered to his
past, but fully able to

00:46:00.860 --> 00:46:07.240
live in the present and
to dream of a future.

00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:09.070
Thank you.
