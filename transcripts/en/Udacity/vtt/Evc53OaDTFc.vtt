00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.430
So how do we apply this to clustering,
okay?

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:08.320
Well, basically the idea is you,
you're going to clust together

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:13.060
all the data points that are in
an attraction basin of one mode.

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:14.870
So, what's an attraction basin?

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:19.580
An attraction basin is the region for
which all the trajectories lead to

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.360
the same mode, or
all the points go there, all right?

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.210
So here's a very simple example.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.083
So here is a set of points,
drawn from a distribution.

00:00:29.083 --> 00:00:30.837
And you can tell, obviously that,

00:00:30.837 --> 00:00:34.850
the idea is that there probably is
a mode here, and theres a mode there.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.330
Great, the question is,
which points belong to which mode?

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:43.160
And that's done very simply by,
if you were to start your mean shift

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.622
in each of these locations,
which mode does it end up at?

00:00:48.622 --> 00:00:51.518
All right, and that's illustrated
in this figure here, right?

00:00:51.518 --> 00:00:56.670
So, here we're showing
you the area of which

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.050
all of the, the mean shifts get to
this mode, the mode on the right.

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.310
Likewise, everywhere over here,
they get to the mode on the left.

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:08.620
So it clusters your feature space

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:13.480
using these basins of attraction
to the two modes, all right?

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.050
So, when we're going to do this for

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.820
segmenting a color image, what we
have to do is define some feature.

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.920
So maybe we're using just u and
v or maybe u, v, and x, y,

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.530
if we want a color and location.

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.030
We have to initialize the window,
the windows at every pixel,

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.430
that is every possible color
point in that LUV space.

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:33.470
Now, would you do every one?

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.730
No, you would take a sampling of them.

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.083
You do mean shift until it converges.

00:01:38.083 --> 00:01:43.129
And then you merge all the pixels,
all those initial points into

00:01:43.129 --> 00:01:48.300
a single cluster that all end
up at the same peak, all right?

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.542
And so, that looks a little
bit like this, all right?

00:01:50.542 --> 00:01:56.475
So here, L and U, this is L and V, okay?

00:01:56.475 --> 00:02:00.200
These are the actual pixel colors,
distributed.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.422
And if you run your clustering,

00:02:02.422 --> 00:02:07.208
and here, it's being done in this,
LU space, all right?

00:02:07.208 --> 00:02:10.449
If you run your mean shift here,
okay, you will see,

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:13.780
see all these points going
up to that peak right there?

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.750
And then there's a peak here,
and a peak here, and a peak here?

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.442
Those, let's see, one, two,
three, four, five, six, seven,

00:02:20.442 --> 00:02:24.949
so there's seven modes here, and that
means there seven basins of attraction,

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:28.170
which means you would end up
with seven regions in the image.
