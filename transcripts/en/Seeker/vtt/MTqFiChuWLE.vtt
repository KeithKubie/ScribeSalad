00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.800
Can you tell how someone looks
based only on how they sound?

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.290
Why yes, you can!

00:00:10.846 --> 00:00:12.586
Hey everyone, Laci
Green here for D News.

00:00:12.586 --> 00:00:13.960
Think of the last
time you talked

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.251
on the phone with someone
that you've never met before.

00:00:16.251 --> 00:00:17.680
What kind of
assumptions, if any,

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.305
did you make about
how the person looks

00:00:19.305 --> 00:00:20.580
based on their voice?

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.390
A common one would be their
sex, which is usually, but not

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:24.470
always, obvious.

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:26.860
Males with high voices and
females with low voices

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.720
can sometimes cause
some confusion.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.900
You may be able to tell
their approximate age.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.880
Grandmas and children do tend
to sound a little different.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.380
But what about what
their voice says

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.990
about their height, their
weight, maybe even their race.

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:41.540
A new study coming out of
Washington University and UCLA

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.600
a confirms past
studies that people

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.120
can tell someone's height
just by hearing their voice.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.670
The participants
heard various voices

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:50.086
saying meaningless
words, and then

00:00:50.086 --> 00:00:53.540
were asked to pick who was
tallest, who was shortest,

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.612
and to rate five voices
in order of height.

00:00:55.612 --> 00:00:57.070
Now, the participants
were accurate

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.350
63% of the time, which,
OK, admittedly is not

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.660
extremely accurate, but
it's definitely much higher

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.118
than if they were
picking randomly.

00:01:04.118 --> 00:01:05.930
The researchers
also figured out how

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.610
people were able to accurately
guess someone's height--

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.570
subglottal resonances.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:11.820
Sounds fancy, no?

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.500
Subglottal Resonances
are the sound

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.050
that come from
the lower airways,

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:17.010
below the Adam's
Apple, if you have one.

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.120
They describe it like
blowing into a glass bottle.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.370
If the bottle's big, there's
more room for resonating,

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:23.530
and if it's small,
there's less room.

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.250
So the taller you are, the
more your voice resonates,

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.720
and the more your
voice resonates,

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:28.926
the deeper it sounds.

00:01:28.926 --> 00:01:30.300
The researchers
found that people

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.520
were able to pick up on very
subtle technical differences

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.700
in these subglottal resonances,
which could be particularly

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.077
useful for busting criminals.

00:01:38.077 --> 00:01:40.660
Because sometimes the only clue
about what a person looks like

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.157
happens over the phone.

00:01:42.157 --> 00:01:43.990
Another claim that I've
heard is that people

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.700
can tell over the phone
how heavy someone is.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.060
Could body weight affect
these subglottal resonances?

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.999
Several studies have taken
a look and busted the myth.

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:54.790
So far, none have found
conclusive evidence

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.070
that gaining or losing
weight affects your voice.

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.560
And what about race?

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.510
A person's race is
sometimes connected

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:02.580
to a geographical
area, which is then

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.130
connected to a particular
dialect or accent,

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.630
and in this case,
it might be easier

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.330
to identify someone's
race because you

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:09.060
know where they're from.

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.934
But what about when
people of different races

00:02:10.934 --> 00:02:12.210
are from the same area?

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.332
Then, they all have
similar speech patterns.

00:02:14.332 --> 00:02:16.540
Could you tell a black
American from a white American

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.650
from a Latino American who
are all from the same city?

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.320
Scientists studied
this in depth.

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.730
They looked at how
physiology varies by race

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.550
and discovered that it's an
enormous, tangled mess, as you

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.400
might expect when
you try to pinpoint

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.630
physiological differences by
something socially constructed.

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.969
But hey, that's a story
for a different day.

00:02:34.969 --> 00:02:36.510
The takeaway here
is that controlling

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.302
for dialect and accent,
there's no evidence

00:02:38.302 --> 00:02:39.843
that you can tell
the race of someone

00:02:39.843 --> 00:02:41.410
just by talking to
them on the phone.

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:42.880
Thanks for tuning
into D News, everyone.

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.250
If you're interested
in vocal matters,

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.666
you should check
out Trace's video

00:02:45.666 --> 00:02:47.880
about why we hate our own voice.

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.170
And we'll catch you soon
with more science updates.
