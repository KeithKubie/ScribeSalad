00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.380
As we mentioned in the previous video, visual cues are

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:06.490
one of the main ingredients to an effective visualization. In the

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:08.780
next couple of videos, we'll cover some of the main

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:11.410
visual cues that you can use to represent data in your

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:14.100
charts. The first one that we're going to discuss is

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:18.730
position. When using position as a visual cue, you compute value

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:21.110
by looking at the position of a point compared to

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:24.900
the position of others in the same space or coordinate system.

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.670
Here, this would translate to this point's x and

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:30.760
y coordinate. Position is useful in coding because it

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.240
takes up less space than other visual cues. It's

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.180
really space efficient. Each data point is simply represented as

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.480
a dot. Also, points often have the same size

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.530
which allows you to easily identify trends, clusters, and outliers

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.180
by plotting all of your data at once. But

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.200
if you have too many data points in your plot,

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.620
it can be a challenge to identify what each

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.420
point represents. For example, imagine that this chart were covered

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.680
with dozens of green dots just like this one. It

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.230
might be hard for us to identify individual dots and

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.680
really understand what they mean, or what day do they

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.230
correspond to. Another commonly used visual cue is length, which

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.400
is often encountered in the form of bar charts. The

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.400
length of a bar indicates the intensity or value of

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.480
your data point. For example, the longer the bar,

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.610
the greater the absolute value. One more encoding that's

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.750
very common is angle. Angle ranges from 0 to

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.750
360 degrees on a circle. Angles are commonly used to

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.260
represent parts of a whole. A pie chart is

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.630
a really common example of this. The sum of

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.760
the wedges in this pie complete a circle and

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:40.580
give us 360 degrees. One negative aspect to using angles

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.830
as a visual encoding is that human eyes can have a

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.370
difficult time differentiating angles. For example,

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.090
25 degrees and 30 degrees may

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.905
look very similar. Because of this, angle is an encoding that you

00:01:51.905 --> 00:01:55.104
may want to avoid if you're trying to show very small differences.
