00:00:00.042 --> 00:00:04.209
- Apart from the hump, the
actual meat is very, very lean.

00:00:07.837 --> 00:00:08.670
Wow.

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.369
Grilled camel mishkak.

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:15.952
(upbeat music)

00:00:18.425 --> 00:00:19.867
Good morning everyone, it's Mark Wiens

00:00:19.867 --> 00:00:23.200
with migrationology.com in Muscat, Oman.

00:00:25.082 --> 00:00:27.455
Mustafa is coming to pick Ying and I up

00:00:27.455 --> 00:00:29.662
and we're gonna do a few
more things around Muscat

00:00:29.662 --> 00:00:31.700
and then we're actually
gonna take a quick day trip

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.975
over to Nizwa which is
his hometown and it is

00:00:35.975 --> 00:00:39.395
one of the cultural capitals of Oman.

00:00:39.395 --> 00:00:42.153
Our flight is technically
tomorrow but it's at 1 a.m.

00:00:42.153 --> 00:00:44.813
So we'll be going to the
airport later tonight

00:00:44.813 --> 00:00:48.009
so we are actually packing
up and we're gonna check

00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:50.312
out of our hotel now and
we're gonna leave our bag

00:00:50.312 --> 00:00:53.046
in Mustafa's car and then
we'll go around all day long.

00:00:53.046 --> 00:00:55.629
(upbeat music)

00:00:56.934 --> 00:00:59.240
We got all checked out of our hotel,

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:03.173
met up with Mustafa and
we are driving now towards

00:01:03.173 --> 00:01:04.506
the Opera House.

00:01:08.315 --> 00:01:11.072
We're not gonna go to a an opera or a show

00:01:11.072 --> 00:01:13.535
but we're gonna try to
get a tour of the inside

00:01:13.535 --> 00:01:16.470
and I think they are pretty formal.

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.816
I did bring with me a collared shirt,

00:01:18.816 --> 00:01:21.680
so hopefully we can get in
with the collared shirt.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.847
Oh, it's been a long time.

00:01:25.974 --> 00:01:29.330
The actual structure of the
Royal Opera House in Muscat

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.494
is incredible and impressive.

00:01:31.494 --> 00:01:36.249
The architectural design and
it is just impressively clean

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:39.080
and even just walking now along,

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.212
this is a marble floor on the bottom,

00:01:41.212 --> 00:01:45.936
you can hear your shoes
squeaking because it's so clean.

00:01:45.936 --> 00:01:48.798
- My name is Salman,
I'm gonna be your guide

00:01:48.798 --> 00:01:50.812
(mumbles) Opera House.

00:01:50.812 --> 00:01:54.848
The Royal Opera House was
opened first time in 2011.

00:01:54.848 --> 00:01:57.621
- Our tour guide has said that the roofing

00:01:57.621 --> 00:02:00.560
and all the wood is mahogany from Burma

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.417
and then all of the flooring
and all of the marble

00:02:04.417 --> 00:02:05.662
is from Italy.

00:02:05.662 --> 00:02:07.613
(tour guide mumbling)

00:02:07.613 --> 00:02:09.938
- We use exotic system here.

00:02:09.938 --> 00:02:13.938
That mean if you are on
outside, you cannot hear

00:02:14.901 --> 00:02:16.582
anything from inside.

00:02:16.582 --> 00:02:20.182
Just if you touch here,
you can feel the (mumbles).

00:02:20.182 --> 00:02:21.797
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

00:02:21.797 --> 00:02:23.574
- This is the main auditorium.

00:02:23.574 --> 00:02:26.090
(laughing)

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.923
- Wow.

00:02:28.176 --> 00:02:31.676
It really opens up into a huge auditorium.

00:02:32.573 --> 00:02:35.303
Even just speaking I
can hear my voice carry,

00:02:35.303 --> 00:02:37.824
so the acoustics in
here must be incredible

00:02:37.824 --> 00:02:39.652
when there's a performance.

00:02:39.652 --> 00:02:41.961
- [Salman] This is the main auditorium.

00:02:41.961 --> 00:02:45.544
The capacity of seats
is about 1,100 seats.

00:02:46.461 --> 00:02:49.207
- [Mark] And the small
booths, it's just four seats?

00:02:49.207 --> 00:02:50.766
- Four seats.
- Okay.

00:02:50.766 --> 00:02:53.599
(easygoing music)

00:02:56.662 --> 00:02:59.797
That tour lasted just
for about 15 minutes.

00:02:59.797 --> 00:03:03.010
Oh wow, it's really blazing
hot once you come outside.

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.808
Another good thing about taking the tour

00:03:04.808 --> 00:03:07.599
of the Opera House is
that they crank the AC

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:09.488
nice and cold in there.

00:03:09.488 --> 00:03:12.175
I don't think I'm really
the opera going type of guy

00:03:12.175 --> 00:03:14.212
but definitely after taking that tour

00:03:14.212 --> 00:03:16.358
and going on the inside, I would love

00:03:16.358 --> 00:03:18.275
to go to an opera here.

00:03:25.597 --> 00:03:27.922
From the Royal Opera House,
we just took a quick drive

00:03:27.922 --> 00:03:30.005
over to the Grand Mosque.

00:03:38.538 --> 00:03:40.865
And it is just incredible.

00:03:40.865 --> 00:03:44.184
Just impressive the amount of marble

00:03:44.184 --> 00:03:46.958
and just the open spaces, the minarets.

00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:48.804
A couple of the main features.

00:03:48.804 --> 00:03:51.834
Number one is this unbelievable chandelier

00:03:51.834 --> 00:03:54.398
which I am walking underneath right now

00:03:54.398 --> 00:03:56.680
and the whole dome.

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.763
Number two is the carpet.

00:03:59.766 --> 00:04:02.409
In this entire prayer
hall it is just the single

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:05.300
one carpet which was actually stitched

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.961
within the prayer hall
so that it fit perfectly

00:04:08.961 --> 00:04:12.488
and it's all just one
entire gigantic carpet.

00:04:12.488 --> 00:04:15.321
(easygoing music)

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:27.970
We are driving on our way to
Nizwa and this should take

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:29.485
a little bit over an hour.

00:04:29.485 --> 00:04:32.818
We got some snacks including Chips Oman.

00:04:33.862 --> 00:04:37.480
Which is the famous potato chips in Oman.

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.670
Oh, they're not just plain potato chips,

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:43.587
they have some kind of
chili seasoning on them.

00:04:44.543 --> 00:04:48.293
Oh yeah, they smell
actually quite fantastic.

00:04:49.701 --> 00:04:51.284
Omani potato chips.

00:04:55.404 --> 00:04:58.571
Yeah, I think it is a chili seasoning.

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:05.877
Then that is your typical potato chip.

00:05:09.501 --> 00:05:12.668
Always crispy and salty and addictive.

00:05:31.688 --> 00:05:34.601
We arrived to Nizwa, that was a good drive

00:05:34.601 --> 00:05:36.309
and the first thing we're gonna do is go

00:05:36.309 --> 00:05:39.559
to the Nizwa Castle and the Nizwa Souq.

00:05:41.636 --> 00:05:45.136
(speaks foreign language)

00:05:49.403 --> 00:05:51.323
It's kind of like many people will give it

00:05:51.323 --> 00:05:52.156
as a gift.

00:05:52.156 --> 00:05:53.875
Yeah, or buy for a special occasion?

00:05:53.875 --> 00:05:56.844
- [Man] Special occasion,
weddings, (mumbles).

00:05:56.844 --> 00:05:59.513
- At the back of this market,
they have a very famous

00:05:59.513 --> 00:06:00.923
Omani desserts.

00:06:00.923 --> 00:06:02.678
The dessert is called halwa.

00:06:02.678 --> 00:06:05.155
- Halwa and like--
- Drink coffee with it?

00:06:05.155 --> 00:06:07.014
- [Man] Swallow it and
throw it with coffee.

00:06:07.014 --> 00:06:08.630
Omani coffee, this is the way to do it.

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:09.630
- All right.

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:15.479
So they have one tin open
here that you can sample.

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:19.154
You can grab a spoon and
it is made of a combination

00:06:19.154 --> 00:06:21.571
of starch and sugar and nuts.

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:26.067
It kind of has a jelly-ish texture to it.

00:06:27.569 --> 00:06:29.236
Mm, kind of has a...

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:33.330
Kind of has a spice fragrance to it.

00:06:34.737 --> 00:06:37.169
I think they use a lot
of rosewater as well.

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:39.494
There's a lot of rosewater
that's used as well

00:06:39.494 --> 00:06:42.244
as well as ghee which is the fat.

00:06:46.691 --> 00:06:49.978
I'll just eat the whole thing.

00:06:49.978 --> 00:06:53.478
Mmm, oh the nuts are really good in there.

00:06:55.094 --> 00:06:58.431
It is pretty sweet, it's
like a sticky jelly.

00:06:58.431 --> 00:07:02.205
It's almost like a
roasted, burnt taste to it.

00:07:02.205 --> 00:07:03.790
Maybe that comes from the sugar.

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:06.056
A little bit of spiced tinge as well.

00:07:06.056 --> 00:07:09.306
Then you gotta follow that with coffee.

00:07:11.763 --> 00:07:15.680
Yeah, so the coffee is
not sweet, but the halwa

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:22.607
is very sweet and then you
chase it with the coffee.

00:07:25.959 --> 00:07:29.862
We have just entered the
Nizwa Castle and Fort.

00:07:29.862 --> 00:07:32.029
The castle dates back to the ninth century

00:07:32.029 --> 00:07:34.332
and the fort is from the 17th century,

00:07:34.332 --> 00:07:37.075
so they added that on later.

00:07:37.075 --> 00:07:40.145
The walls of the fort
are 34 meters in height

00:07:40.145 --> 00:07:42.312
and 45 meters in diameter.

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:44.972
Hello, Ying.
- Hello, Mark.

00:07:44.972 --> 00:07:47.453
- I'm climbing a flight
of stairs and emerging

00:07:47.453 --> 00:07:49.054
onto the roof area.

00:07:49.054 --> 00:07:52.804
Oh yeah, now we have a
nice view of the fort.

00:07:55.055 --> 00:07:57.189
Ying is waiting in the staircase protected

00:07:57.189 --> 00:07:58.272
from the sun.

00:08:01.628 --> 00:08:06.116
So we are entering into
the tall, rounded fortress.

00:08:06.116 --> 00:08:08.467
Walking up this staircase,
there are all sorts of traps

00:08:08.467 --> 00:08:12.507
and one of the interesting
traps is this crack

00:08:12.507 --> 00:08:15.907
in the wall right here above me.

00:08:15.907 --> 00:08:19.686
They would pour boiling
date juice down the hole

00:08:19.686 --> 00:08:22.277
on the victims on the people
trying to get to the fort.

00:08:22.277 --> 00:08:25.212
So imagine I'd just be
standing here and some hot,

00:08:25.212 --> 00:08:29.767
flaming boiling syrup
comes falling on your head.

00:08:29.767 --> 00:08:32.702
Then you also gotta be
careful on the ground,

00:08:32.702 --> 00:08:36.828
they had some traps here
where you'd fall into a hole.

00:08:36.828 --> 00:08:38.861
I had to switch hats real fast.

00:08:38.861 --> 00:08:43.555
This sun is some of the most
intense sun I've ever felt.

00:08:43.555 --> 00:08:46.555
I'm gonna hike up the staircase now.

00:08:50.393 --> 00:08:52.242
One of the things that's
amazing is that the fort

00:08:52.242 --> 00:08:55.460
is self sustainable so
they have an internal well

00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:58.339
where they can get fresh
water and then they can get

00:08:58.339 --> 00:09:00.044
all the supplies they need in here.

00:09:00.044 --> 00:09:03.329
It's basically an entire mound
of earth that is designed

00:09:03.329 --> 00:09:06.892
to protect from canons
and guns and all sorts

00:09:06.892 --> 00:09:11.264
of weapons and it really
is an amazing fortress.

00:09:11.264 --> 00:09:13.308
The walls are so thick.

00:09:13.308 --> 00:09:15.737
There are some great
views of Nizwa from here.

00:09:15.737 --> 00:09:18.510
You can see the entire
village, the Old Souq,

00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:22.120
the old areas of town, the little oasis

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:26.287
of date palm trees and the
mountains in the background.

00:09:29.856 --> 00:09:32.169
We finished walking around
the fort and we walked

00:09:32.169 --> 00:09:35.766
over to a restaurant called
Bin Ateeq for lunch today.

00:09:35.766 --> 00:09:38.226
It's a restaurant that
some of you recommended me,

00:09:38.226 --> 00:09:40.669
so thank you all for the recommendation.

00:09:40.669 --> 00:09:43.108
This is their branch in Nizwa.

00:09:43.108 --> 00:09:45.851
They also have a couple
of branches in Muscat

00:09:45.851 --> 00:09:48.619
and we just ordered a
couple of different dishes.

00:09:48.619 --> 00:09:51.837
Man, that sun will just
drain you of your energy.

00:09:51.837 --> 00:09:54.265
I'm in need of some nourishment right now.

00:09:54.265 --> 00:09:57.431
The food has all arrived
and we got a private room

00:09:57.431 --> 00:09:59.658
and we're eating Omani
style on the ground.

00:09:59.658 --> 00:10:01.717
What they do is they
have carpets in the room

00:10:01.717 --> 00:10:05.649
and they put out a piece of
plastic for any spillage.

00:10:05.649 --> 00:10:08.935
Okay, this is the first dish,
what's the name of this dish?

00:10:08.935 --> 00:10:10.074
- Thareed.
- Thareed.

00:10:10.074 --> 00:10:10.964
- [Man] Thareed.

00:10:10.964 --> 00:10:13.523
- It actually looks sort
of like some kind of a mash

00:10:13.523 --> 00:10:17.276
but those are pieces of bread
which are halfway pureed

00:10:17.276 --> 00:10:18.464
and then there's fish in it.

00:10:18.464 --> 00:10:20.760
Then there's curry sauce
and you usually just use

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:24.593
these three fingers,
grab a piece of the fish.

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:29.557
Oh, that is hot and then
mix it with the bread.

00:10:30.659 --> 00:10:32.492
Oh, that's really hot.

00:10:33.609 --> 00:10:35.358
That is really flaming hot.

00:10:35.358 --> 00:10:39.525
The bread just absorbs the
heat, so you gotta eat it fast.

00:10:42.502 --> 00:10:43.335
Mmm.

00:10:45.524 --> 00:10:46.994
Oh, that is wonderful.

00:10:46.994 --> 00:10:48.827
That is like stuffing.

00:10:50.687 --> 00:10:53.244
It's like bread that's moist.

00:10:53.244 --> 00:10:57.023
It's fluffy and salty,
you can taste a blend

00:10:57.023 --> 00:10:58.773
of curry spice in it.

00:10:59.644 --> 00:11:02.394
And then the fish, the fish is...

00:11:03.606 --> 00:11:07.717
Kind of a dry slightly fishy tasting fish.

00:11:07.717 --> 00:11:11.266
That complements the
salty, curry bread stuffing

00:11:11.266 --> 00:11:12.602
extremely well.

00:11:12.602 --> 00:11:15.616
You can tell that it's
like bread that's mixed

00:11:15.616 --> 00:11:18.047
with curry and has just
been cooked with curry

00:11:18.047 --> 00:11:22.271
so that it's sort of, it's
soggy, but in a very good way.

00:11:22.271 --> 00:11:26.854
This is a little bowl of
ghee which is fat, oil.

00:11:26.854 --> 00:11:29.680
It's very common to pour
some of it on your rice

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:31.524
especially white rice.

00:11:31.524 --> 00:11:35.436
I'll just add a little bit on this side.

00:11:35.436 --> 00:11:37.203
We got a piece of fried fish.

00:11:37.203 --> 00:11:41.063
I will break a little
piece, is it king fish?

00:11:41.063 --> 00:11:41.906
- [Man] Yes.

00:11:41.906 --> 00:11:43.573
- I think it tastes like,
it's like king fish.

00:11:43.573 --> 00:11:46.394
Maybe it's king fish in the (mumbles).

00:11:46.394 --> 00:11:49.114
Okay, it's all king fish.

00:11:49.114 --> 00:11:50.565
For the bread dish,
you're supposed to just

00:11:50.565 --> 00:11:52.363
use your three fingers, but for this dish,

00:11:52.363 --> 00:11:55.598
you can go back to your whole kind of hand

00:11:55.598 --> 00:11:58.649
and I'll try Omani style
which is where you take

00:11:58.649 --> 00:12:01.816
the rice into the center of your palm.

00:12:07.696 --> 00:12:08.529
Mmm, wow.

00:12:09.942 --> 00:12:14.032
That is like some really
strong butter, yeah.

00:12:14.032 --> 00:12:17.938
Tastes like animal, more
animal tasting butter,

00:12:17.938 --> 00:12:19.308
melted butter.

00:12:19.308 --> 00:12:20.348
- [Man] This is Makbus.

00:12:20.348 --> 00:12:21.670
- Makbus.
- Makbus.

00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:22.824
- [Man] You know Makbus?

00:12:22.824 --> 00:12:26.991
Rice cooked with a heavier
meat or chicken or fish.

00:12:28.983 --> 00:12:31.150
But it is cooked together.

00:12:32.352 --> 00:12:36.019
- I will first take off
a piece of that meat

00:12:37.668 --> 00:12:39.418
and then go for rice.

00:12:45.024 --> 00:12:46.024
- Mmm, yeah.

00:12:49.282 --> 00:12:53.008
You can tell that the rice
has been cooked with the meat

00:12:53.008 --> 00:12:56.676
because the rice is just
infused with the meaty flavor.

00:12:56.676 --> 00:12:59.529
It doesn't have a strong
taste but you can definitely

00:12:59.529 --> 00:13:01.705
taste a little bit of spice,
maybe a little bit of cumin

00:13:01.705 --> 00:13:03.984
in there and maybe turmeric.

00:13:03.984 --> 00:13:07.203
But the spice is quite
light, but then it really

00:13:07.203 --> 00:13:09.478
just kind of focuses on that meat flavor.

00:13:09.478 --> 00:13:13.965
For my next bite, I'll go
in for some of the chutney.

00:13:13.965 --> 00:13:15.814
Then also some of the
salad, I think this is

00:13:15.814 --> 00:13:17.731
a tomato based chutney.

00:13:21.439 --> 00:13:22.890
There are little bones in this meat,

00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:25.723
so you gotta take it off the bone.

00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:39.293
There's a little bone.

00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:43.063
Mmm, good.

00:13:44.935 --> 00:13:46.354
With the chutney it's excellent though.

00:13:46.354 --> 00:13:48.169
That just complements it so well.

00:13:48.169 --> 00:13:50.975
It's like a tomato puree
but you can also taste a lot

00:13:50.975 --> 00:13:52.558
of garlic in there.

00:13:58.842 --> 00:14:02.803
That was some very much
needed nourishment and energy

00:14:02.803 --> 00:14:06.711
and back out into the blazing sunshine.

00:14:06.711 --> 00:14:07.798
That food was really good.

00:14:07.798 --> 00:14:10.274
What I really liked, the
bread dish with the fish

00:14:10.274 --> 00:14:13.574
was very interesting and very good,

00:14:13.574 --> 00:14:15.504
but definitely the lamb and the rice

00:14:15.504 --> 00:14:19.187
with the tomato garlicky
chutney was my favorite dish.

00:14:19.187 --> 00:14:22.020
(easygoing music)

00:14:35.369 --> 00:14:37.664
We just took a drive for about 30 minutes

00:14:37.664 --> 00:14:40.204
and we are at an area called Al Hamra.

00:14:40.204 --> 00:14:43.818
This is a city, town, more like a town,

00:14:43.818 --> 00:14:47.001
but then we came to the
ancient, old part of the town.

00:14:47.001 --> 00:14:50.584
There are narrow lanes
with mud structures.

00:14:51.623 --> 00:14:55.456
We're gonna walk around
here for a little bit.

00:14:56.671 --> 00:14:58.421
- [Man] Is it closed?

00:15:00.917 --> 00:15:03.567
- You can see these walls are made of mud

00:15:03.567 --> 00:15:05.200
and some kind of grass as well.

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:07.902
We've just stepped into
a place where they have

00:15:07.902 --> 00:15:10.037
the irrigation canal running.

00:15:10.037 --> 00:15:12.954
This is in the middle of the hot desert.

00:15:12.954 --> 00:15:16.680
There is flowing, very clear looking water

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:19.086
and it's flowing down there somewhere.

00:15:19.086 --> 00:15:21.118
Walking through this
ancient village is amazing

00:15:21.118 --> 00:15:23.150
and it's so quiet and peaceful.

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:26.083
Some of the homes here have been abandoned

00:15:26.083 --> 00:15:28.001
and they're deserted but some of the homes

00:15:28.001 --> 00:15:31.168
are still in use, people live in them.

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:35.913
It's cool.

00:15:37.192 --> 00:15:40.391
This is incredible, it's
like exploring a lost city.

00:15:40.391 --> 00:15:42.766
It's just completely quiet.

00:15:42.766 --> 00:15:44.849
We're the only ones here.

00:15:51.363 --> 00:15:52.196
Hello, Ying.

00:15:52.196 --> 00:15:54.064
- [Ying] Hello, Mark.

00:15:54.064 --> 00:15:56.647
(exotic music)

00:16:07.765 --> 00:16:09.893
- We drove up the mountain
for a little ways,

00:16:09.893 --> 00:16:11.645
just up from the village we were,

00:16:11.645 --> 00:16:13.623
the oasis that we were in before.

00:16:13.623 --> 00:16:16.140
This place is called Misfat Al Abriyeen,

00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:19.650
and it is another small, little village

00:16:19.650 --> 00:16:21.630
up on the side of the rocky mountain.

00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:23.927
There are also many farms, date trees,

00:16:23.927 --> 00:16:25.790
so we're gonna walk around
here and I'm already

00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:28.363
loving this little village
and you can see just

00:16:28.363 --> 00:16:31.978
homes built on to the
top of the rocks as well.

00:16:31.978 --> 00:16:34.811
(group murmuring)

00:16:37.969 --> 00:16:40.033
We are coming to the irrigation system

00:16:40.033 --> 00:16:42.456
and down to the farms.

00:16:42.456 --> 00:16:45.277
Immediately the temperature
drops, it's fantastic.

00:16:45.277 --> 00:16:47.078
There's a cold breeze from the mountain

00:16:47.078 --> 00:16:51.431
and the trees and the
water just provides relief

00:16:51.431 --> 00:16:52.681
to the hot sun.

00:16:55.819 --> 00:16:58.983
In the middle of just
barren bone dry desert

00:16:58.983 --> 00:17:01.910
and there's another amazing oasis.

00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:04.366
There are date trees,
there are banana trees,

00:17:04.366 --> 00:17:06.031
there were mangoes up there,

00:17:06.031 --> 00:17:08.030
there's rushing water.

00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:11.727
This is incredible to see this oasis

00:17:11.727 --> 00:17:13.293
in the middle of the desert.

00:17:13.293 --> 00:17:15.027
(Ying mumbling)

00:17:15.027 --> 00:17:16.277
Looks like we're back in Thailand.

00:17:16.277 --> 00:17:17.444
- [Ying] Yeah.

00:17:18.518 --> 00:17:19.351
- Almost.

00:17:19.351 --> 00:17:21.934
(exotic music)

00:17:40.102 --> 00:17:42.448
The canal and irrigation system is really

00:17:42.448 --> 00:17:46.093
the lifeline, the blood vessel
of this entire community.

00:17:46.093 --> 00:17:50.532
There's a stream of water
which comes from a well

00:17:50.532 --> 00:17:52.988
in the mountain or from
a rock in the mountain

00:17:52.988 --> 00:17:55.250
and then it's channeled
through the entire village

00:17:55.250 --> 00:17:58.136
and through the date palm trees.

00:17:58.136 --> 00:17:59.983
You can see, I'm sitting
on the ledge right now,

00:17:59.983 --> 00:18:02.855
the water is flowing and
then every now and then,

00:18:02.855 --> 00:18:05.364
there's a little opening
which is blocked right now.

00:18:05.364 --> 00:18:07.610
When they wanna get water
down to the next level,

00:18:07.610 --> 00:18:10.016
down to the next terrace,
they open up that channel

00:18:10.016 --> 00:18:14.025
of water and then it trickles
down to the trees below.

00:18:14.025 --> 00:18:17.525
It kind of reminds me of the rice terraces

00:18:18.434 --> 00:18:20.431
in a number of different countries in Asia

00:18:20.431 --> 00:18:23.848
except this is the Omani version of that.

00:18:38.989 --> 00:18:41.532
We drove back to Nizwa
and there was no way

00:18:41.532 --> 00:18:44.441
I could leave Oman without one more dose

00:18:44.441 --> 00:18:46.274
of pre-dinner mishkak.

00:18:47.726 --> 00:18:50.105
(speaks foreign language)

00:18:50.105 --> 00:18:51.969
- [Man] One kebab and?

00:18:51.969 --> 00:18:55.053
- Kebab, camel, chicken, that's good,

00:18:55.053 --> 00:18:55.963
maybe that's good.

00:18:55.963 --> 00:18:59.463
(speaks foreign language)

00:19:04.953 --> 00:19:07.448
These mishkak stands sort
of set up in the parking lot

00:19:07.448 --> 00:19:10.632
of the fort, the fort
is behind me illuminated

00:19:10.632 --> 00:19:14.143
and you can just smell the
aroma of the grilling meat

00:19:14.143 --> 00:19:15.776
from across the parking lot.

00:19:15.776 --> 00:19:18.420
They had camel, so I had
to get a skewer of camel

00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:20.777
and I also got a couple
of chicken and squid

00:19:20.777 --> 00:19:22.951
and a kebab as well.

00:19:22.951 --> 00:19:26.619
I'm just bathing in
the smoke, enjoying it.

00:19:26.619 --> 00:19:30.119
(speaks foreign language)

00:19:36.444 --> 00:19:38.173
They have a couple of
tables sitting out here

00:19:38.173 --> 00:19:39.528
in the parking lot.

00:19:39.528 --> 00:19:43.225
It's a wonderful atmosphere, environment.

00:19:43.225 --> 00:19:46.078
You can smell the meat
grilling and I just got

00:19:46.078 --> 00:19:47.741
a couple of skewers.

00:19:47.741 --> 00:19:50.217
When Mustafa told me they had camel,

00:19:50.217 --> 00:19:51.458
I had to get a skewer.

00:19:51.458 --> 00:19:53.436
This is my last night in Oman.

00:19:53.436 --> 00:19:55.897
This one on the top I believe is the camel

00:19:55.897 --> 00:19:57.875
and I think that is the piece of the hump.

00:19:57.875 --> 00:20:00.481
This one is the kebab,
there's some squid in here

00:20:00.481 --> 00:20:01.652
and some chicken.

00:20:01.652 --> 00:20:06.026
Oh man, he put the
spicy sauce all over it.

00:20:06.026 --> 00:20:09.859
I gotta start with the
camel, how could I not?

00:20:13.684 --> 00:20:14.517
Wow.

00:20:16.749 --> 00:20:20.710
I am just amazed at how good camel is.

00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:24.670
It's incredible and that
is some awesome sauce too.

00:20:24.670 --> 00:20:28.580
That sauce is tangy, a little bit spicy

00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:31.370
and pretty salty, but
that goes incredibly good

00:20:31.370 --> 00:20:34.091
with the smoky, charred meat.

00:20:34.091 --> 00:20:36.367
I think one of the keys to making mishkak

00:20:36.367 --> 00:20:39.737
is you gotta cook it on a
really hot flaming fire.

00:20:39.737 --> 00:20:42.639
The coals are white hot
and then he fans the flames

00:20:42.639 --> 00:20:46.552
so it really gives it a smoky touch to it.

00:20:46.552 --> 00:20:49.135
That's delicious, camel skewer.

00:20:50.624 --> 00:20:53.199
I should also mention
that apart from the hump,

00:20:53.199 --> 00:20:56.116
the actual meat is very, very lean.

00:20:59.933 --> 00:21:00.766
Wow.

00:21:03.711 --> 00:21:05.458
Grilled camel mishkak.

00:21:05.458 --> 00:21:07.291
Next up fro the kebab.

00:21:12.078 --> 00:21:12.911
Wow.

00:21:13.792 --> 00:21:16.292
That tastes like meatloaf, mm.

00:21:17.126 --> 00:21:20.315
Has a little bit of a
spongy texture to it,

00:21:20.315 --> 00:21:24.352
but then it's like a hamburger on a stick.

00:21:24.352 --> 00:21:27.352
I gotta eat that piece of hump next.

00:21:29.743 --> 00:21:30.576
Oh, wow.

00:21:33.988 --> 00:21:35.784
You don't even need to
chew, it just starts

00:21:35.784 --> 00:21:39.927
to turn to liquid as
it touches your tongue.

00:21:39.927 --> 00:21:43.260
That is like the equivalent of kobe beef

00:21:44.184 --> 00:21:46.684
or of like tuna belly, oh wow.

00:21:47.832 --> 00:21:50.469
I think I have a new
favorite piece of meat.

00:21:50.469 --> 00:21:52.886
Okay finally chicken skewers.

00:21:57.070 --> 00:22:00.175
Oh, yeah, that's good as well,

00:22:00.175 --> 00:22:02.153
but gotta give it up for that camel.

00:22:02.153 --> 00:22:03.556
I thought I was gonna
say the drive-through

00:22:03.556 --> 00:22:05.251
is really popular and now they're no more.

00:22:05.251 --> 00:22:06.644
- [Man] They all left.

00:22:06.644 --> 00:22:08.411
- They all left.

00:22:08.411 --> 00:22:11.313
The drive-thru here is especially popular.

00:22:11.313 --> 00:22:14.699
Many people just drive
up, order some mishkak,

00:22:14.699 --> 00:22:16.826
get it through the window and
then just sit in their cars

00:22:16.826 --> 00:22:21.299
in the comfort of the AC to
devour skewers of mishkak

00:22:21.299 --> 00:22:24.632
but I cannot trade this ambiance sitting

00:22:26.065 --> 00:22:29.065
on a plastic chair in a parking lot.

00:22:31.624 --> 00:22:34.943
Omani street food mishkak was fantastic.

00:22:34.943 --> 00:22:37.037
We are now walking across the parking lot

00:22:37.037 --> 00:22:38.537
to go have dinner.

00:22:42.363 --> 00:22:44.660
- [Man] Those are fish,
they are most popular.

00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:47.035
- At this restaurant, they
have all the seafood up front

00:22:47.035 --> 00:22:49.679
on ice and you just choose
the seafood you want

00:22:49.679 --> 00:22:52.005
and I think they're gonna
grill it all up for us.

00:22:52.005 --> 00:22:54.875
We're gonna take a seat
and fresh grilled seafood

00:22:54.875 --> 00:22:56.542
coming up very soon.

00:22:59.942 --> 00:23:02.878
Final meal in Oman and we got a variety

00:23:02.878 --> 00:23:04.774
of different seafood.

00:23:04.774 --> 00:23:07.892
A big plate of shrimp,
some squid and a fish.

00:23:07.892 --> 00:23:12.825
They grilled it up, it smells
smoky and we're getting

00:23:12.825 --> 00:23:14.752
ready to dig in for dinner tonight.

00:23:14.752 --> 00:23:16.257
I'm gonna begin with
the shrimp and these are

00:23:16.257 --> 00:23:17.987
some jumbo ocean shrimp.

00:23:17.987 --> 00:23:20.827
Look at the size of this.

00:23:20.827 --> 00:23:23.533
Few things make me
happier than jumbo shrimp.

00:23:23.533 --> 00:23:26.499
You can see there's some
kind of a spice blend on it.

00:23:26.499 --> 00:23:29.472
Maybe some garlic and
I might just squeeze it

00:23:29.472 --> 00:23:32.834
with a little bit of lime
first or lemon actually,

00:23:32.834 --> 00:23:34.001
this is lemon.

00:23:35.314 --> 00:23:36.814
Then I gotta peel.

00:23:39.012 --> 00:23:40.624
Is it okay to use both fingers?

00:23:40.624 --> 00:23:41.650
- Yeah, yeah.
- Okay.

00:23:41.650 --> 00:23:42.733
It's hard to.

00:23:45.063 --> 00:23:46.146
Okay, I will.

00:23:47.143 --> 00:23:50.016
I will pull off the head and
set that aside for later.

00:23:50.016 --> 00:23:53.316
We also got a couple of
Mediterranean Levantine dishes.

00:23:53.316 --> 00:23:55.557
This one is mutabal and also some hummus.

00:23:55.557 --> 00:23:57.655
One of the common ways to eat
seafood, especially shrimp

00:23:57.655 --> 00:23:59.743
is to dip it in mutabal.

00:23:59.743 --> 00:24:02.588
I think that would be
almost like tartar sauce.

00:24:02.588 --> 00:24:05.421
Mutabal is a roasted eggplant dip.

00:24:11.855 --> 00:24:12.688
Oh, yeah.

00:24:15.787 --> 00:24:18.120
I am so happy eating shrimp.

00:24:19.139 --> 00:24:21.380
These are really, really firm.

00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:24.977
That mutabal makes it, it's
almost like a tartar sauce,

00:24:24.977 --> 00:24:28.227
but like a smoky, creamy, eggplant dip.

00:24:32.236 --> 00:24:33.069
Oh, yeah.

00:24:36.346 --> 00:24:39.895
I'll take this out, whoa,
that is a giant tortilla

00:24:39.895 --> 00:24:40.968
like bread.

00:24:40.968 --> 00:24:42.318
I'm gonna actually set this down,

00:24:42.318 --> 00:24:44.856
gotta go for a little bit of lemon.

00:24:44.856 --> 00:24:47.631
Squeeze some lemon on there.

00:24:47.631 --> 00:24:48.881
Bread and fish.

00:24:52.845 --> 00:24:57.500
And salad, add a little bit
of salad and then mutabal

00:24:57.500 --> 00:24:58.333
and dip.

00:25:04.179 --> 00:25:05.012
Mmm.

00:25:08.141 --> 00:25:08.974
Yeah.

00:25:09.838 --> 00:25:12.921
That fish is definitely char grilled.

00:25:14.051 --> 00:25:16.884
It has a smoky burnt flavor to it.

00:25:17.959 --> 00:25:21.393
And then just a really meaty fish.

00:25:21.393 --> 00:25:23.605
I really like it with that mutabal.

00:25:23.605 --> 00:25:27.188
I'm gonna squeeze lemon
all over this squid

00:25:32.628 --> 00:25:35.878
and then go in for a couple of nuggets.

00:25:36.732 --> 00:25:38.916
Should I dip as well?

00:25:38.916 --> 00:25:41.166
I'm going hummus this time.

00:25:45.333 --> 00:25:46.166
Wow.

00:25:47.014 --> 00:25:49.597
That squid is like creamy soft.

00:25:51.981 --> 00:25:53.518
Or did I get the egg?

00:25:53.518 --> 00:25:55.496
I think I might've gotten squid egg

00:25:55.496 --> 00:25:57.345
'cause it's almost like creamy soft.

00:25:57.345 --> 00:25:59.224
- [Mustafa] I recommend you (mumbles).

00:25:59.224 --> 00:26:00.270
- [Mark] Yeah, (mumbles).

00:26:00.270 --> 00:26:01.437
- Okay.
- Yeah.

00:26:02.646 --> 00:26:03.563
Some lemon.

00:26:04.557 --> 00:26:06.290
- And Mustafa is
recommending I go for some

00:26:06.290 --> 00:26:10.457
of the belly of the fish, go
for a little bit of lemon.

00:26:13.503 --> 00:26:16.920
Oh yeah, fish belly is a wonderful thing.

00:26:18.617 --> 00:26:22.284
All the fat and there's
some bones in there.

00:26:23.766 --> 00:26:24.599
Oh, nice.

00:26:27.573 --> 00:26:28.406
Oh, yeah.

00:26:30.988 --> 00:26:33.416
The seasoning is quite
simple but it's all about

00:26:33.416 --> 00:26:35.724
that grilled flavor and the lemon

00:26:35.724 --> 00:26:38.057
that accompanies it so well.

00:26:43.375 --> 00:26:45.437
We finished dinner with Mustafa.

00:26:45.437 --> 00:26:48.125
That was some good seafood
and now we have jumped

00:26:48.125 --> 00:26:51.344
into a taxi, it's about 9:30
p.m. and we are on our way

00:26:51.344 --> 00:26:52.688
to the airport.

00:26:52.688 --> 00:26:55.198
That was about an hour
and 15 minutes drive.

00:26:55.198 --> 00:26:57.439
We made it to the airport.

00:26:57.439 --> 00:26:59.915
This is it for our trip to Oman.

00:26:59.915 --> 00:27:02.089
We were only in Oman for two full days,

00:27:02.089 --> 00:27:03.909
but it seemed like we were
here for an entire week

00:27:03.909 --> 00:27:06.171
because we did so much in the two days.

00:27:06.171 --> 00:27:08.133
I wanna say a special thank you to Mustafa

00:27:08.133 --> 00:27:09.637
for taking us around.

00:27:09.637 --> 00:27:11.830
Without him, we definitely
couldn't have done

00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:15.475
what we did, so thank
you very much, Mustafa.

00:27:15.475 --> 00:27:19.186
It's about 11:30 p.m.
now, our flight leaves.

00:27:19.186 --> 00:27:21.959
We're flying on Turkish Air to Istanbul.

00:27:21.959 --> 00:27:25.187
Our flight leaves at 1:20 a.m.

00:27:25.187 --> 00:27:27.931
I am thrilled to be going to Istanbul

00:27:27.931 --> 00:27:32.502
and I am going to include
everything on tomorrow's video.

00:27:32.502 --> 00:27:34.234
I'm gonna end today's video now.

00:27:34.234 --> 00:27:35.853
Thank you all for
watching, please remember

00:27:35.853 --> 00:27:37.931
to give it a thumbs up if you enjoyed it

00:27:37.931 --> 00:27:40.097
and I will see you on the next video.

00:27:40.097 --> 00:27:44.004
Stay tuned tomorrow, in an hour from now,

00:27:44.004 --> 00:27:47.040
but it's tomorrow we
are going to Istanbul.

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:49.623
(upbeat music)
