   » LEE ANN POTTER: Fabulous. 

00:17:55.391 --> 00:17:57.630
I've got a very important 
question for you. In with the 

00:17:57.631 --> 00:17:59.257
exchanges that we have been 
having with colleagues about 

00:17:59.258 --> 00:18:02.110
this program, I was asking how 
could I introduce you?

00:18:05.189 --> 00:18:08.861
Do I call him R.L.? Robert? Mr. 
Stine?

00:18:12.885 --> 00:18:17.674
And someone said Bob. 
   » R.L. STINE: No one ever 

00:18:17.675 --> 00:18:23.212
called me R.L. all my life. I 
used to be funny. I wrote joke 

00:18:23.213 --> 00:18:26.892
books for a long time. You want 
to hear one of my best jokes? 

00:18:26.893 --> 00:18:30.967
Want to hear a joke? It's a kids
joke.  What do you get when you 

00:18:30.968 --> 00:18:33.213
cross a dog with a frog?

00:18:37.708 --> 00:18:39.963
You get a dog that can lick 
himself from across the room. 

00:18:39.964 --> 00:18:41.991
See? Now I made a living with 
jokes like 

00:18:45.064 --> 00:18:47.306
that, and I -- yeah. All right. 
All right.

00:18:54.442 --> 00:18:57.301
It was -- I was known as jovial 
Bob Stine. And then I got scary,

00:18:57.302 --> 00:19:02.049
and I started writing scary 
books, and I thought that jovial

00:19:02.050 --> 00:19:05.514
Bob Stine? That's a horrible 
name for a horror writer, right?

00:19:07.561 --> 00:19:09.561
So I just used my initials.

00:19:11.012 --> 00:19:14.063
And people always say -- kids 
always say, what does R.L. stand

00:19:14.064 --> 00:19:16.064
for?

00:19:18.898 --> 00:19:20.898
And they pick something scary

00:19:23.465 --> 00:19:25.465
. 

00:19:28.554 --> 00:19:30.632
» LEE ANN POTTER: I think it's 
great. Yeah. Just a little bit.

00:19:33.713 --> 00:19:35.757
So, I'm glad you mentioned that 
you wrote jokes, because I read 

00:19:35.758 --> 00:19:37.758
that when 

00:19:39.015 --> 00:19:41.498
you were about 9 years old, at 
the age of some of our students 

00:19:41.499 --> 00:19:43.499
in the audience, 

00:19:46.817 --> 00:19:48.817
that you found a typewriter in a
storage 

00:19:51.287 --> 00:19:53.287
room and started writing jokes

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:24.935
? 
   » R.L. STINE: My parents 

00:20:24.936 --> 00:20:27.604
didn't understand it at all. My 
mother would stand outside of my

00:20:30.972 --> 00:20:33.676
door and say, "What's wrong with
you? Go outside and play! Go 

00:20:33.677 --> 00:20:35.677
outside!

00:20:37.670 --> 00:20:39.094
And I would say it's boring out 
there." And type type type type 

00:20:39.095 --> 00:20:41.135
type. I have been doing that 
ever since.

» RACHEL WILLIAMS: I think
   » LEE ANN POTTER: I think 

00:20:45.823 --> 00:20:50.101
it's great. Here at the library 
of congress, this is the largest

00:20:50.102 --> 00:20:55.446
library in the world. We go into
the card catalog and try to get 

00:20:55.447 --> 00:20:57.447
a sense of how many books has a 

00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:03.879
particular author written, and 
we're used to seeing a handful. 

00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:05.880
When we did a search on R.L.

00:21:07.343 --> 00:21:10.224
Stine, we found hundreds of 
titles.  We're curious: Where do

00:21:10.225 --> 00:21:11.460
all of your identities come 
from? 

00:21:11.461 --> 00:21:16.174
» R.L. STINE: I don't know. 
Where do they come from? We all 

00:21:16.175 --> 00:21:18.175
get ideas, right? I don't know.

00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:22.660
I would tell you, how many of 
you have 

00:21:25.952 --> 00:21:28.259
read "The Haunted Mask," or seen
the TV show? That's a Halloween 

00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:30.260
story.

00:21:34.182 --> 00:21:36.628
It's about a girl named Carly 
Bets, who wants to be scary at 

00:21:36.629 --> 00:21:38.629
Halloween time.

00:21:40.267 --> 00:21:41.916
And she tries on a scary mask, 
and it sticks to her face, and 

00:21:41.917 --> 00:21:43.917
she can't get it off.

00:21:44.982 --> 00:21:47.628
And it becomes her face, and it 
turns her evil. And I will tell 

00:21:47.629 --> 00:21:52.319
you where the idea came from for
that story. It actually came 

00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:54.320
from my son, Matt, when he was a
little guy.

00:21:57.411 --> 00:21:59.411
It was Halloween, and I was 
watching Matt.

00:22:00.679 --> 00:22:03.580
He was down on the floor trying 
on a green rubber Frankenstein 

00:22:03.581 --> 00:22:07.450
mask. And he pulled it down over
his head, and he couldn't get it

00:22:07.451 --> 00:22:11.510
off. And I'm watching from the 
doorway. And he's down there, 

00:22:11.511 --> 00:22:15.393
and he's tugging and he's 
tugging. And I thought, what a 

00:22:15.394 --> 00:22:20.712
great idea! I should have helped
him, right? Instead, I went and 

00:22:20.713 --> 00:22:24.189
started making notes and saying 
oh, great idea for a story. 

00:22:26.629 --> 00:22:29.095
» LEE ANN POTTER: Perfect. 
   » R.L. STINE: And poor Matt 

00:22:29.096 --> 00:22:32.148
is still in the mask. It's a 
very sad story. 

00:22:32.957 --> 00:22:34.788
» LEE ANN POTTER: I love it. 
   » R.L. STINE: You never know 

00:22:34.789 --> 00:22:38.661
where you're going to get ideas.
One day I was walking my dog in 

00:22:38.662 --> 00:22:40.662
the 

00:22:43.163 --> 00:22:45.163
park, and these words popped 
into my 

00:22:49.094 --> 00:22:52.381
head: Say cheese and die. Why 
those words? I started thinking,

00:22:52.382 --> 00:22:56.054
well, what if there's an evil 
camera? What if some kids 

00:22:56.055 --> 00:22:58.696
discovered the camera? And what 
if the camera took pictures of 

00:23:00.345 --> 00:23:02.345
bad things that happened to you 
a little bit in the future?

00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:08.060
And that's how that book, "Say 
Cheese 

00:23:09.739 --> 00:23:10.544
and Die" got started is from 
those words popping into my 

00:23:10.545 --> 00:23:13.215
head. You never know where ideas
are going to come from. 

00:23:14.264 --> 00:23:16.289

a unique idea, I mentioned that

the library of congress is the 
largest library in the world.

copyright office. Have you heard

00:23:25.266 --> 00:23:27.704
that word before? So you have an
idea, when you write a 

00:23:30.975 --> 00:23:33.400
book, one of the things that 
you're encouraged to do is 

00:23:33.401 --> 00:23:35.401
submit that book to the U.S.

00:23:37.502 --> 00:23:38.924
copyright office so that you 
receive -- you own a copyright 

00:23:38.925 --> 00:23:40.925
on your work.

00:23:42.604 --> 00:23:44.604
That means your ideas are yours 
and your ideas are protected.

00:23:47.117 --> 00:23:48.753
When we did a search on all of 
the titles in our collection, we

00:23:48.754 --> 00:23:51.799
asked our colleagues if they 
would send over to our office a 

00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:55.871
bunch of them.  So we have about
10% of the books that are in the

00:23:55.872 --> 00:23:57.872
library of congress that you 
wrote with us today.

00:24:00.182 --> 00:24:02.182
And many of these books were 
submitted 

00:24:03.641 --> 00:24:05.907
when the copyright was 
requested. 

00:24:03.641 --> 00:24:05.887
» R.L. STINE: Uh-huh. 
   » LEE ANN POTTER: And we 

00:24:05.888 --> 00:24:07.888
contacted 

00:24:11.002 --> 00:24:12.845
our colleague in the copyright 
office, and we said Hey, we 

00:24:12.846 --> 00:24:17.564
don't suppose you have the 
copyright registration forms for

00:24:17.565 --> 00:24:19.606
all of the hundreds of books 
that Mr. Stine has written, and 

00:24:19.607 --> 00:24:22.455
he responded through an e-mail, 
and he was like of course we do.

00:24:24.284 --> 00:24:28.378
We're the U.S. copyright office.
I went by his office yesterday, 

00:24:28.379 --> 00:24:31.445
and we have a gift for you. 
   » R.L. STINE: A gift? 

00:24:32.057 --> 00:24:34.508

an official copy of your very 

00:24:38.585 --> 00:24:40.585
first copyright registration 
form for 

00:24:43.256 --> 00:24:44.114

   » LEE ANN POTTER: We thought 

00:24:50.402 --> 00:24:54.283
that was pretty note. 
   » R.L. STINE: That was 

00:24:54.284 --> 00:24:56.284
amazing.

00:24:59.423 --> 00:25:01.465
The first one was "Welcome to 
Deadhouse," and I think it was 

00:25:01.466 --> 00:25:06.547
the scariest book of them all. I
didn't know what I was doing. It

00:25:06.548 --> 00:25:11.014
was the first one I wrote. It 
didn't have the funny stuff. I 

00:25:11.015 --> 00:25:13.270
always like to do a book that's 
scary and funny at the same 

00:25:13.271 --> 00:25:15.271
time, and this one is just 
scary.

00:25:18.376 --> 00:25:20.609
The second one, "Stay out of the
Basement," that had funny stuff 

00:25:20.610 --> 00:25:27.126
in it. I figured out what I was 
doing. This is amazeing to see. 

00:25:27.127 --> 00:25:30.026
I have never seen any of this. 
   » LEE ANN POTTER: We put a 

00:25:30.027 --> 00:25:34.294
copy of it on the screen. It's a
two-page form. But we have lots 

00:25:34.295 --> 00:25:36.325
of them. 
   » R.L. STINE: I guess that's 

00:25:36.326 --> 00:25:38.277
a good thing. 
   » LEE ANN POTTER: It is a 

00:25:38.278 --> 00:25:41.980
good thing. When you wrote the 
first "Goosebumps" book, did you

00:25:41.981 --> 00:25:43.816
imagine that it would become a 
series? 

00:25:43.817 --> 00:25:47.500
» R.L. STINE: When I wrote the 
first one, I thought we would do

00:25:47.501 --> 00:25:50.541
two or three. That was it. I 
didn't know people would like 

00:25:50.542 --> 00:25:52.980
it. I wanted to be funny. 
   » LEE ANN POTTER: Yeah. 

00:25:52.981 --> 00:25:57.260
» R.L. STINE: And I didn't 
understand it at all. And I used

00:25:57.261 --> 00:25:59.261
to go to school, and I'd 

00:26:00.708 --> 00:26:03.356
say, "Why do you like these 
books?" And kids would always 

00:26:03.357 --> 00:26:06.807
say we like to be scared. So, I 
thought okay, forget the funny 

00:26:07.017 --> 00:26:09.248
stuff. I'll be scary from now 
on.

see if I can come over here. 
Nope. The light is terrible. And

00:26:56.425 --> 00:26:58.425
I'm going to tell you -- let me 
ask you a question first.

00:27:01.525 --> 00:27:05.229
How many of you have ever seen a
ghost? How many? No, no. I mean 

00:27:05.230 --> 00:27:07.674
a real ghost. A real ghost. Not 
on television.

00:27:11.694 --> 00:27:13.694
Not in the movies

00:27:26.459 --> 00:27:28.283
. Maybe I saw a ghost once. I 
don't know. I'm going to tell 

00:27:28.284 --> 00:27:31.937
you. You can help me decide. I'm
going to tell you a true ghost 

00:27:34.990 --> 00:27:37.445
story that happened to my 
brother Bill and me when we were

00:27:37.446 --> 00:27:40.093
kids back in Ohio. It was 
Halloween time, and Bill and I 

00:27:43.192 --> 00:27:45.841
were very excited, because it 
was the first Halloween that we 

00:27:45.842 --> 00:27:51.327
were allowed to go out trick or 
treating without our parents. We

00:27:51.328 --> 00:27:54.602
were going out by ourselves for 
the first time. And we both got 

00:27:54.603 --> 00:27:56.603
dressed as ghosts.

00:27:58.288 --> 00:28:00.533
We put sheets down, and we cut 
out eyes, and we were very scary

00:28:00.534 --> 00:28:03.400
ghosts, and we got shopping 
bags, big shopping bags 

00:28:07.541 --> 00:28:09.541
to collect all the candy.

00:28:12.013 --> 00:28:14.013
And I took a can of that silly 
string. You know that stuff?

00:28:16.736 --> 00:28:18.736
You squeeze it and the string 
comes out? Yeah.

00:28:21.799 --> 00:28:26.307
Just in case we had to string 
somebody. So, I tucked it in my 

00:28:26.308 --> 00:28:29.560
costume.  And Bill and I went 
outside. It was a cold October 

00:28:29.561 --> 00:28:31.561
night.

00:28:35.505 --> 00:28:37.132
I remember it was the kind of 
cold that clings to the back of 

00:28:37.133 --> 00:28:39.133
your neck.

00:28:40.853 --> 00:28:43.911
The ground was all crunchy, hard
from the frost. There was a tiny

00:28:43.912 --> 00:28:48.393
sliver of the moon half covered 
in cloud high in the sky.  And 

00:28:48.394 --> 00:28:50.450
Bill and I, we always started 
out trick or treating at Mrs.

00:28:53.503 --> 00:28:55.145
Dawson's house across the 
street. And that was just our 

00:28:55.146 --> 00:28:59.067
tradition. We always started 
there. But now I looked across 

00:28:59.068 --> 00:29:01.514
the street, and her house was 
completely dark.

00:29:04.794 --> 00:29:06.623
I said, "I guess she's not home,
Bill. We'll have to go on 

00:29:06.624 --> 00:29:10.722
without her." So we started at 
the next house. We started trick

00:29:10.723 --> 00:29:13.169
or treating down the block. And 
my family was very poor.

00:29:18.079 --> 00:29:20.123
We lived in a tiny little house.
There were blocks of very tiny 

00:29:20.124 --> 00:29:24.802
houses, which was great at 
Halloween time, because it meant

00:29:24.803 --> 00:29:28.665
you didn't have to go up any 
long driveways.  You didn't have

00:29:28.666 --> 00:29:30.910
any long walks.  You could just 
go from house to house. 

00:29:34.173 --> 00:29:37.051
So Bill and I, we went three or 
four blocks down, and then we 

00:29:37.052 --> 00:29:40.709
went three or four blocks and 
came back. And by the time we 

00:29:40.710 --> 00:29:45.992
came back, our bags were just 
bulging with candy. And I looked

00:29:45.993 --> 00:29:50.882
across the street, and I saw a 
light on in Mrs. Dawson's front 

00:29:50.883 --> 00:29:52.883
window.

00:29:54.295 --> 00:29:57.238
I said "Bill, I guess she's 
back. Let's go over there.

00:30:00.343 --> 00:30:02.343
" As we went up her driveway, I 
could see it wasn't a light.

00:30:06.459 --> 00:30:09.098
It was a big Jack-o-lantern with
a big grin on its face and 

00:30:09.099 --> 00:30:13.768
yellow fire inside it. We got on
Mrs. Dawson's front stoop, and I

00:30:13.769 --> 00:30:18.932
knocked on the door, and we 
waited. She didn't come. So, I 

00:30:18.933 --> 00:30:20.933
knocked again, and I rang the 
bell.

00:30:23.028 --> 00:30:25.028
She didn't come to the door.

00:30:27.325 --> 00:30:32.610
Bill said, "She's in there, Bob.
Go ahead. String her." So I took

00:30:32.611 --> 00:30:34.480
out the silly string, and I 
raised it to her door, and then 

00:30:34.481 --> 00:30:36.481
I stopped.

00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:40.600
I stopped, and I froze, because 
I saw 

00:30:43.509 --> 00:30:45.543
the Jack-o-lantern in the front 
window had changed. It wasn't 

00:30:45.544 --> 00:30:48.396
yellow anymore. It was a bright 
scarlet red, and it had 

00:30:52.827 --> 00:30:54.827
a big frown on its face

00:30:56.913 --> 00:30:58.913
.

00:31:00.207 --> 00:31:04.081
A big scowl. We were half way 
down the driveway when the front

00:31:04.082 --> 00:31:07.542
door swung open, and Mrs. Dawson
came out. I remember she was in 

00:31:07.543 --> 00:31:09.543
this gray 

00:31:10.804 --> 00:31:12.804
nightgown, this long, gray 
nightgown.

00:31:14.073 --> 00:31:16.073
I remember it fluttering in the 
wind, fluttering.

00:31:17.968 --> 00:31:19.968
And she said, "Why did you wake 
me? Why did you wake me?

00:31:23.302 --> 00:31:26.341
" And I said, "Oh, I'm sorry, 
Mrs. Dawson. I didn't know. I'm 

00:31:26.342 --> 00:31:28.342
really sorry. But can I ask you 
one question?

00:31:31.754 --> 00:31:33.754
How did you do that with your 
Jack-o-lantern?

00:31:39.065 --> 00:31:41.065
" And she said, "Jack-o-lantern?

00:31:42.942 --> 00:31:44.942
I don't have a Jack-o-lantern.

00:31:46.022 --> 00:31:47.251
" And Bill and I looked in the 
window, and it was completely 

00:31:47.252 --> 00:31:50.495
dark. Nothing was there. We ran 
across the street, dumped out 

00:31:53.986 --> 00:31:55.020
all the candy, divided it all 
up, and we never mentioned it 

00:31:55.021 --> 00:31:57.021
again.

00:31:58.088 --> 00:31:59.912
We didn't mention the 
Jack-o-lantern. We didn't say a 

00:31:59.913 --> 00:32:02.146
thing about it. 
    The next morning, I woke up 

00:32:02.147 --> 00:32:05.822
and I thought, you know what? I 
should apologize to Mrs. Dawson.

00:32:07.681 --> 00:32:09.681
We woke her up. That wasn't 
right.

00:32:12.589 --> 00:32:14.621
So, I got dressed for school, 
had breakfast, and went across 

00:32:14.622 --> 00:32:17.059
the street to apologize, but 
there was a big truck in Mrs.

00:32:20.162 --> 00:32:24.635
Dawson's driveway, and these men
going in and out of her house. 

00:32:24.636 --> 00:32:27.488
And I went up to one of the 
workers, and I said, "What's 

00:32:27.489 --> 00:32:30.761
going on?". He said I guess 
you're getting new neighbors, 

00:32:30.762 --> 00:32:34.643
kid. I said "Why? What do you 
mean?

00:32:39.749 --> 00:32:41.749
" He said, "Oh, I'm sorry. 
Didn't you hear? Mrs.

00:32:44.877 --> 00:32:47.729
Dawson died two weeks ago." 
    That's my true ghost story. 

00:32:47.730 --> 00:32:49.730

person can do. I just try to

of Slappy books, because he's so

00:35:02.210 --> 00:35:04.851
whether it's a real or fake 
title? Should we play that? 

00:35:04.852 --> 00:35:07.704
» R.L. STINE: Let's do this. 
Let's see how much you really 

00:35:07.705 --> 00:35:09.705
know about "Goosebumps"s, okay?

00:35:13.207 --> 00:35:15.655
This is a list of "Goosebumps" 
titles.  Some of them are real; 

00:35:15.656 --> 00:35:20.539
some of them are fake. Let's see
if you can tell which ones are 

00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:23.185
real and which ones are fake, 
okay? Just shout it out. Shout 

00:35:23.186 --> 00:35:25.186
out fake or real. Okay? Here we 
go.

00:35:28.488 --> 00:35:30.488
One, son of slappy. 

00:35:32.297 --> 00:35:34.297
» real

00:35:38.439 --> 00:35:40.074
! 
   » R.L. STINE: You're right. 

00:35:40.075 --> 00:35:42.075
Number two. You just have to 
shout it once, and 

00:35:45.165 --> 00:35:47.165
we'll be fine.

00:35:52.912 --> 00:35:54.912
Frosty the abombable snow man. 
That's fake.

00:35:58.650 --> 00:36:02.539
Number three, the barking ghost.
You got it! You guys are good.  

00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:04.540
Yeah that's real. How about this
one?

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:12.522
More Rons from marsons from 
mars? That is fake, but I think 

00:36:12.523 --> 00:36:17.427
that would make a great 
"Goosebumps" title. Morons from 

00:36:17.428 --> 00:36:20.284
Mars.  I sent that title to my 
editors, and I 

00:36:24.213 --> 00:36:26.213
said let's do a "Goosebumps" 
called 

00:36:27.684 --> 00:36:29.684
"Morons from mars," and they 
said I 

00:36:31.149 --> 00:36:33.149
can't do that because I might 
offend the morons.

00:36:38.904 --> 00:36:42.380
Let's try number five, "It Came 
from my Nose." That one's fake. 

00:36:42.381 --> 00:36:44.421
That one's fake. 
   » LEE ANN POTTER: That's a 

00:36:44.422 --> 00:36:46.422
good one, too. 
   » R.L.

00:36:50.115 --> 00:36:54.418
STINE: Creature teacher. That 
one's real! That one's real.

00:36:59.868 --> 00:37:01.868
Attack of the 2,000

00:37:03.144 --> 00:37:05.144
pound Datson?

00:37:09.314 --> 00:37:11.958
How about eat Eat your 
Breakfast? That's fake, too, but

00:37:11.959 --> 00:37:15.232
that would be a good title. I 
think that's scary, somebody 

00:37:15.233 --> 00:37:17.472
eating your breakfast. I think 
it would be.

00:37:23.468 --> 00:37:26.120
And how about, I am slappy's 
evil twin? That one's real. That

00:37:26.121 --> 00:37:28.766
one's real. You guys are good! 
   » LEE ANN POTTER: I love it. 

00:37:28.767 --> 00:37:30.767
   » R.L.

00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:34.271
STINE: You guys are scary. 
   » LEE ANN POTTER: Book titles

00:37:34.272 --> 00:37:39.376
do certainly give us a sense of 
a book's content. But sometimes 

00:37:39.377 --> 00:37:42.039
it helps to have a little bit 
more of a description of a book 

00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:47.139
when you're deciding if it's a 
book you want to read or not. 

00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:50.023
So, you guys know when you go to
a library, and you look at your 

00:37:50.024 --> 00:37:52.666
card catalog, not only do you 
get the title 

00:37:55.717 --> 00:37:57.550
of a book, but you also get a 
description of the book that 

00:37:57.551 --> 00:38:01.861
you're considering reading. 
Well, those descriptions are 

00:38:01.862 --> 00:38:03.862
often 

00:38:04.941 --> 00:38:06.941
written right here at the 
library of congress.

00:38:08.406 --> 00:38:10.439
We have a group of colleagues 
who work in the building next 

00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:15.531
door to this building, in our 
Madison building, who are part 

00:38:15.532 --> 00:38:17.765
of the library's cataloging 
division. And part of their job 

00:38:17.766 --> 00:38:22.042
is to read books and then write 
descriptions of those books that

00:38:22.043 --> 00:38:24.043
end up in the card catalog. And 
one of our colleagues who does 

00:38:28.155 --> 00:38:30.155
that, her name is Anne, and 
she's here, too.

00:38:32.633 --> 00:38:34.689
I sent her a note and asked if 
she remembers writing summaries 

00:38:34.690 --> 00:38:38.761
for any of R.L. Stine's books, 
and she immediately responded 

00:38:38.762 --> 00:38:42.849
and said of course, and she gave
me a list of a bunch of them. 

00:38:42.850 --> 00:38:44.892
So, I'm going to read you a 
couple of them.  One of the 

00:38:44.893 --> 00:38:46.893
books that you already 

00:38:47.966 --> 00:38:50.859
mentioned, "Welcome to Dead 
house." Ann's the one who wrote 

00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:53.722
the summary for that book that 
appears in the card catalog.

00:38:57.845 --> 00:39:00.506
It reads "Amanda and Josh move 
with their parents into an old 

00:39:00.507 --> 00:39:04.796
haunted house located in the 
strange town of dark falls where

00:39:04.797 --> 00:39:08.054
people are unlike any they have 
known before." Do you think it 

00:39:08.055 --> 00:39:10.919
would be hard to capture an 
entire book in less than 30 

00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:14.168
words? 
   » R.L. STINE: That's pretty 

00:39:14.169 --> 00:39:15.604
good for two sentences. 
   » LEE ANN POTTER: Here's 

00:39:15.605 --> 00:39:17.605
another one.

00:39:19.473 --> 00:39:21.568
The title of the book is "Why 
I'm afraid of Bees.

00:39:25.443 --> 00:39:27.884
" Garrett's dream is about to 
come true. He's going to 

00:39:27.885 --> 00:39:31.965
exchange bodies with another kid
for a whole week. But the new 

00:39:31.966 --> 00:39:33.966
body isn't human...

00:39:37.454 --> 00:39:40.187
. that's a pretty good 
description, too. 

00:39:37.454 --> 00:39:40.709
» R.L. STINE: It's a bee. 
Where's that part? 

00:39:41.935 --> 00:39:42.948
» LEE ANN POTTER: The title gave
that one away. 

00:39:42.949 --> 00:39:45.638
» R.L. STINE: And a night in the
beehive.

00:39:50.318 --> 00:39:52.318
HiHe sleeps in a beehive all 
night. I would hate that. 

00:39:52.787 --> 00:39:56.250
» LEE ANN POTTER: I don't think 
I would like it either. Might 

00:39:56.251 --> 00:39:57.070
you like to read a little from 
one of your books? 

00:39:57.071 --> 00:39:59.071
» R.L. STINE: I could read 
something.

00:40:01.761 --> 00:40:03.761
I thought I would read you -- 
since 

00:40:05.850 --> 00:40:07.850
we're here, I might as well, you
know?

00:40:08.915 --> 00:40:10.915
This is the very first chapter 
of the 

00:40:12.426 --> 00:40:14.426
first "Goosebumps" slappy's 
world book.

00:40:17.353 --> 00:40:19.388
It's "Slappy Birthday to You." 
This is just how the book starts

00:40:19.389 --> 00:40:21.389
out.

00:40:23.678 --> 00:40:25.678
It has a really weird and stupid
chapter ending.

00:40:30.194 --> 00:40:32.429
So, that's why I like to read 
it. 

00:40:37.326 --> 00:40:39.157
On Ian Barker's 12th birthday, 
he received a gift that brought 

00:40:39.158 --> 00:40:41.158
pain and 

00:40:43.219 --> 00:40:45.219
terror to him and his entire 
family.

00:40:47.301 --> 00:40:49.301
But let's not get ahead of 
ourselves.

00:40:52.222 --> 00:40:56.098
Let's try to enJOIjoy Ian's 
birthday for as long as we can. 

00:40:56.099 --> 00:40:58.551
Let's keep in mind that it was 
not the birthday Ian had hopped 

00:40:58.552 --> 00:41:00.552
for.

00:41:01.615 --> 00:41:02.830
It quickly became a day he would
have given anything to forget. 

00:41:02.831 --> 00:41:08.133
    Ian came down to breakfast 
on that sunny spring morning 

00:41:08.134 --> 00:41:11.609
eager for his special day to 
begin. Almost at once, he had 

00:41:11.610 --> 00:41:13.610
trouble with his 

00:41:17.329 --> 00:41:19.329
-year-old  9-year-old sister, 
molly, but that was nothing new.

00:41:24.488 --> 00:41:26.488
If you asked Ian how to spell 
molly, he 

00:41:27.696 --> 00:41:32.251
would say TROUBLE. There were 
pancakes on the table.

00:41:36.139 --> 00:41:38.991
Molly liked her pancakes drowned
in maple syrup, and she used up 

00:41:38.992 --> 00:41:42.043
most of the syrup before Ian had
a chance, but Ian didn't claim.

00:41:45.260 --> 00:41:49.816
He was -- complain. He was 
determined to be cheerful on his

00:41:50.425 --> 00:41:52.425
birthday.

00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:58.421
Then it came down to the last 
pancake. Mine, Ian said.  You've

00:41:58.422 --> 00:42:00.422
already had six.

00:42:02.299 --> 00:42:04.299
But I saw it first, Molly 
insisted.

00:42:05.574 --> 00:42:07.620
She kept her fork poking into 
the side of the pancake. It's my

00:42:07.621 --> 00:42:11.882
birthday. I should get what I 
want today. You always think you

00:42:11.883 --> 00:42:13.883
should get what you want, molly 
declared.

00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:20.230
Molly has red hair and blue 
eyes, and 

00:42:22.105 --> 00:42:24.105
when she gets into an argument, 
her 

00:42:25.593 --> 00:42:28.435
freckled cheeks turn bright 
pink. Her mom turned from the 

00:42:28.436 --> 00:42:30.436
kitchen counter.

00:42:32.305 --> 00:42:34.975
She had been arranging cup cakes
for Ian's party. Fighting again?

00:42:37.631 --> 00:42:39.631
We're not fighting, we're 
disputing.

00:42:40.884 --> 00:42:45.455
Oh, big word, Ian said. I'm so 
totally impressed. They kept 

00:42:45.456 --> 00:42:48.305
their forks in the last 
remaining pancake. You're a 

00:42:48.306 --> 00:42:50.306
jerk, molly said.  I know you 
know that word.

00:42:53.599 --> 00:42:57.105
Don't call Ian names on his 
birthday, Mrs. Barker said. Wait

00:42:57.106 --> 00:42:59.106
until tomorrow. She had a good 
sense of humor.

00:43:02.407 --> 00:43:04.407
Sometimes the kids appreciated 
it. Sometimes they didn't. 

00:43:07.099 --> 00:43:11.582
Why don't you split the pancake 
in two. Good idea, Ian said.  He

00:43:11.583 --> 00:43:14.656
used his fork to divide the 
pancake into two pieces.  No 

00:43:14.657 --> 00:43:16.725
fair, molly cried.  Your half is
twice as big as mine.

00:43:20.020 --> 00:43:22.067
Ian laughed and gobbled up his 
half before molly could do 

00:43:22.068 --> 00:43:24.068
anything about it. Molly frowned
about it.

00:43:26.942 --> 00:43:31.828
Don't you know how to eat? You 
have syrup on your chin. Ian 

00:43:31.829 --> 00:43:34.473
raised the bottle. How would you
like it in your hair? Whoa. 

00:43:34.885 --> 00:43:36.885
Mrs.

00:43:39.835 --> 00:43:41.835
Barker turned away from the cup 
cakes and stepped to the table.

00:43:44.933 --> 00:43:47.818
Breakfast is other over. You're 
12 now. You really have to stop 

00:43:47.819 --> 00:43:52.699
the fighting. She squeezed Ian's
shoulder. Your cousins are 

00:43:52.700 --> 00:43:54.700
coming for your party.

00:43:55.752 --> 00:43:58.010
I want you to be extra nice to 
them and don't pick fights like 

00:43:58.011 --> 00:44:01.482
you always do. Benny and Johnny?
They always start it.

00:44:04.772 --> 00:44:08.844
Ian always starts it, molly 
chimed in. Shut up, Ian chimed. 

00:44:08.845 --> 00:44:13.756
Just listen to me, Mrs. Barker 
pleaded. I want you to be nice 

00:44:13.757 --> 00:44:15.757
to your cousins.  They have been
going through a rough time.

00:44:19.671 --> 00:44:21.103
Uncle Donny is out of work and 
aunt Marie is getting over the 

00:44:21.104 --> 00:44:25.431
operation. Can I have a cup cake
now? Ian slapped the table.

00:44:28.909 --> 00:44:31.141
If she has one, I want one, too.
Have you heard a word I said, 

00:44:31.142 --> 00:44:33.142
Mrs. Barker asked?

00:44:38.491 --> 00:44:41.972
And Ian raised his right hand as
if he were swearing an oath. 

00:44:41.973 --> 00:44:47.067
Hands off, Mrs. Barker said. Go 
get your dad. Tell him guests 

00:44:47.068 --> 00:44:50.789
will be arriving soon. Where is 
he? In his workshop, his mom 

00:44:50.790 --> 00:44:52.790
answered. Where else?

00:44:54.686 --> 00:44:56.929
Where else, molly mimicked. Ian 
walked down the back hall to the

00:44:57.944 --> 00:45:00.190
door to the basement. He thought
about Johnny and Vinny.

00:45:03.238 --> 00:45:05.238
They lived just a few blocks 
away.

00:45:06.536 --> 00:45:08.564
Johnny was 12 and Vinny was 11, 
but they looked like twins.

00:45:11.821 --> 00:45:13.821
They were both big bruisers, 
tough guys, big for their eyes.

00:45:19.513 --> 00:45:23.625
Loud and GRAP grabby with round 
heads and upturned pig noses. At

00:45:23.626 --> 00:45:26.280
least that's how Ian describes 
them. The kind of guys that were

00:45:26.281 --> 00:45:30.989
always bumping up against people
and each other and always 

00:45:30.990 --> 00:45:33.240
grinning about something mean, 
mean guys.  They're just jealous

00:45:33.241 --> 00:45:39.567
of you. That's what Mrs. Barker 
always told Ian. They're your 

00:45:39.568 --> 00:45:41.568
only cousins, so you have to be 
nice to them.

00:45:43.846 --> 00:45:45.846
Ian opened the basement door and
went 

00:45:47.345 --> 00:45:49.345
down the stairs two at a time.

00:45:50.416 --> 00:45:52.461
The air grew warmer, and it 
smelled of GLU glue.

00:45:55.723 --> 00:45:59.198
His father stood hunches over 
his long work table. He turned. 

00:45:59.199 --> 00:46:01.199
Hi, Ian.

00:46:03.694 --> 00:46:06.553
Hey dad, Ian started, mom says 
-- her's a birthday surprise for

00:46:06.554 --> 00:46:08.554
you, Mr. Barker said.

00:46:10.658 --> 00:46:13.100
He reached both hands to his 
face, plucked out his eyes and 

00:46:13.101 --> 00:46:17.191
held them up to Ian. That's 
chapter one. You like that 

00:46:17.192 --> 00:46:19.858
ending? 
   » LEE ANN POTTER: I love it. 

00:46:19.859 --> 00:46:22.918

eyes? Come on.

00:46:34.962 --> 00:46:36.962
Those may be fake eyes, you 
know?

00:46:40.404 --> 00:46:42.404
Ian's father is a doll repair 
man. Yeah. 

00:46:46.345 --> 00:46:48.345
» LEE ANN POTTER: Later in that 
boom

Slappy, 

00:46:52.910 --> 00:46:53.520
who plays a starring role in an 
upcoming film.

have somebody playing you? Like

Jack Black? It's a weird thing. 
I sit there, and they're talking

00:47:17.743 --> 00:47:19.785
about me in the movie. It's very
strange.

00:47:21.209 --> 00:47:25.305

is a terrific guy. I'm so happy

had my 5 second cameo in my 

00:47:37.141 --> 00:47:41.200
first film. I went down and I 
shot it. We were in a school, 

00:47:41.201 --> 00:47:43.201
and I walk out, 

00:47:47.507 --> 00:47:49.364

"Hello, Mr. Stine." That's my 

00:47:49.365 --> 00:47:51.365
line.

00:47:53.641 --> 00:47:55.641
And he says, "Hello, Mr. Black.

lunchtime. I wanted to go get

the scene over and other again.

PI NOEK

00:59:30.789 --> 00:59:35.113
Pinniocchio to me. He's a wooden
puppet.

00:59:38.388 --> 00:59:40.388
He falls asleep with his feet on
the 

00:59:43.473 --> 00:59:45.770
stove, and he PURN burns his 
feet off. I never forgot that. 

00:59:45.771 --> 00:59:48.632
» LEE ANN POTTER: I wonder if 
your nap was good that day. 

00:59:48.633 --> 00:59:51.482
» R.L. STINE: I don't know if my
nap was good or not that day.

00:59:54.739 --> 00:59:57.376
I never forgot that and I have 
always been interested in 

00:59:57.377 --> 01:00:00.021
puppets, and I think that's how 
Slappy came to be.

01:00:03.297 --> 01:00:06.749
It's funny how much Slappy looks
like Jack Black these days.  

01:00:06.750 --> 01:00:08.750
He's kind of changed, huh?

01:00:09.855 --> 01:00:11.885
Time nor for a couple more? 
» How about this one right here?

01:00:11.886 --> 01:00:13.886
» R.L. STINE: Who has a really 
good question? 

01:00:16.730 --> 01:00:18.730
»

01:00:19.892 --> 01:00:22.551
My name is Stacey, and what's 
your favorite part of a book out

01:00:22.552 --> 01:00:24.552
of all of 

01:00:25.758 --> 01:00:27.758
your books

01:00:28.899 --> 01:00:30.899
? 
» R.L. STINE: I like the ending.

01:00:31.372 --> 01:00:33.372
It means I'm done.

01:00:35.190 --> 01:00:37.893
I like the ending. Who has a 
really good question? 

01:00:39.539 --> 01:00:41.539
» Sasha, in the back? 

01:00:42.796 --> 01:00:44.796
» My name is phoenix, and I was 

01:00:48.036 --> 01:00:49.343
wondering, what inspired you to 
create "Goosebumps"? 

01:00:49.344 --> 01:00:55.478
» R.L. STINE: To do the book 
series? Is that the question? I 

01:00:55.479 --> 01:00:57.479
was doing a series for teens.

01:00:58.757 --> 01:01:00.999
I was doing a scary book series 
for teenagers, which I'm still 

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.243
doing called "Fear Street.

01:01:06.315 --> 01:01:09.169
" It was teens in terror and 
horrible things happening to 

01:01:09.170 --> 01:01:11.170
anybody who moved to Fear 
Street.

01:01:14.069 --> 01:01:16.069
And my editors came to me and 
said, Why 

01:01:17.340 --> 01:01:19.376
don't we do a scary book series 
for younger kids, and I of 

01:01:19.377 --> 01:01:21.377
course said no.

01:01:22.642 --> 01:01:24.691
I didn't want to do 
"Goosebumps". That's the kind of

01:01:24.692 --> 01:01:27.740
business man I am, right? And 
they said no. No one has done 

01:01:27.741 --> 01:01:33.880
it. Let's try it. Let's try it. 
And so I said okay. If I can 

01:01:33.881 --> 01:01:35.881
think of a good name for the 

01:01:37.602 --> 01:01:39.602
series, then maybe we can try a 
couple.

01:01:41.509 --> 01:01:43.509
And one day I was reading TV 
Guide.

01:01:44.797 --> 01:01:46.431
In those days, it had the 
program listings in the middle 

01:01:46.432 --> 01:01:51.330
of the magazine. It told you 
what was on TV. And I'm going 

01:01:51.331 --> 01:01:53.331
through the magazine, and 

01:01:54.994 --> 01:01:56.994
there was a tiny ad at the 
bottom of the 

01:02:03.005 --> 01:02:05.005
page, and it said "It's goose 
bumps week 

01:02:07.106 --> 01:02:10.401
on channel 11," and I stared at 
it and thought that's perfect. 

01:02:10.402 --> 01:02:13.888
We'll call it channel 11. That's
a bad joke. I apologize. That's 

01:02:13.889 --> 01:02:15.889
a very bad joke.

01:02:19.375 --> 01:02:21.375
But that's where the name good 
"Goosebumps"s came from. 

01:02:22.524 --> 01:02:24.138
» LEE ANN POTTER: I think one 
more question, and we're good. 

01:02:27.214 --> 01:02:28.219
» We have one back here. 
» R.L. STINE: One more. All 

01:02:28.220 --> 01:02:30.220
right. 

01:02:34.488 --> 01:02:36.488
» My name is Travis, and my 
question

01:02:42.077 --> 01:02:45.578
is, the new movie "Goosebumps" 
from the new characters? 

01:02:45.579 --> 01:02:47.579
» R.L. STINE: Say it again? 

01:02:51.296 --> 01:02:53.296
» From the new goose bumps 
movie, are 

01:02:54.635 --> 01:02:56.635
you going to make the book from 
the new 

01:02:58.122 --> 01:03:00.588
characters in the goose bumps 
movie? 

01:02:58.122 --> 01:03:02.202
» R.L. STINE: Yeah, well there 
are two books out about the new 

01:03:02.203 --> 01:03:06.681
movie. And they are both telling
the story with the new 

01:03:06.682 --> 01:03:09.126
characters and everything. All 
new characters. Yeah.

01:03:13.243 --> 01:03:15.279
There are two books. 
   » RACHEL WILLIAMS: We have a 

01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:18.590
final question from our friends 
watching online. 

01:03:22.676 --> 01:03:24.676
» My daughter's only 8 months 
old, so 

01:03:26.993 --> 01:03:28.993
she has a little time before we 
get to 

01:03:30.649 --> 01:03:32.649
"Goosebumps"s, but I remember 
the 

01:03:34.513 --> 01:03:36.513
bookshelf where I picked up "the
Barking Ghost.

01:03:38.829 --> 01:03:40.477
" So do you have recommendations
ifs for a costume based on your 

01:03:40.478 --> 01:03:43.140
books? 
» R.L. STINE: She's eight months

01:03:43.141 --> 01:03:45.141
old?

01:03:49.046 --> 01:03:51.046
My grandson Dylan, when he was 2
-- he's 4 now.

01:03:54.762 --> 01:03:57.203
When my grandson Dylan was 2 
years old, he was going out for 

01:03:57.204 --> 01:03:59.204
Halloween as 

01:04:01.281 --> 01:04:03.281
Slappy, and I had Slappy in my 
apartment. I had the dummy.

01:04:06.420 --> 01:04:08.253
And Slappy's clothes fit my 
grandson. They fit him 

01:04:08.254 --> 01:04:10.254
perfectly.

01:04:11.936 --> 01:04:13.936
So, we took the clothes off the 
dummy 

01:04:15.425 --> 01:04:17.871
and Dylan went out for Halloween
as Slappy wearing Slappy's 

01:04:17.872 --> 01:04:19.914
clothes. That's pretty good, 
right? 

01:04:21.546 --> 01:04:25.010
» LEE ANN POTTER: Perfect. 
» R.L. STINE: He never gave them

01:04:25.011 --> 01:04:27.458
back. Poor Slappy doesn't have a
shirt or anything.

01:04:32.379 --> 01:04:34.379
But I don't know about costumes 
for an 8 month old. 

01:04:35.845 --> 01:04:36.059
» LEE ANN POTTER: This has been 
so much fun. 

01:04:36.060 --> 01:04:39.505
» R.L. STINE: This has been 
great. Thank you all so much. 

01:04:39.506 --> 01:04:41.506
Thank you!

[ Cheers and Applause ] 

01:04:58.594 --> 01:05:02.683

Thank you so much.
