00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.850
For this video, I’m going to show you how
to convert something made of styrofoam, into

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:08.390
something made of solid aluminum, using common
play sand, and a little bit of magic.

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.570
Start with some foam board from the dollar
store and peel the paper layers off the top

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.320
and the bottom. Now draw, or print a picture
of whatever it is you want to make, and use

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.640
your pictures as a guide, to cut the foam
board into individual pieces. I cut and glued

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.790
my pieces together, to make an awesome looking
styrofoam pistol. It looks pretty cool like

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:29.850
this, but to turn the styrofoam into metal,
we’re going to need some play sand. We’ll

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.600
also need to fire up the mini metal foundry
we built in a previous project, and start

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.260
liquefying a few of the metal biscuits we
made from recycled soda cans. With that warming

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.730
up, let’s go ahead and pour a bit of sand
into a 5 gallon bucket until it’s at least

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.409
2” to 3” deep. Now take your styrofoam
creation, and glue a thick foam riser somewhere

00:00:46.409 --> 00:00:50.730
on the side, then push the whole thing into
the sand so it stands upright. If we sprinkle

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.479
a bunch more sand around the styrofoam mold,
it should hold it firmly in place, and as

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:57.839
you’re adding the sand, make sure the foam
riser is poking up out of the center. That’s

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:01.719
really important. Now, when the sand covers
everything completely, give the bucket a little

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:05.850
shake to level it out and fill any gaps around
the styrofoam underneath. It’s a good idea

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.270
to have a little spray bottle handy so you
can spritz some water and moisten the top

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.049
layer of the sand. This way you’ll be able
to build a volcano, around the foam riser,

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.619
to act as a funnel leading down to the styrofoam.
Now here’s where the magic begins to happen.

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:22.000
When we pour molten aluminum into the makeshift
funnel, the foam at the bottom vaporizes in

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.770
an instant, and the liquid aluminum rushes
in to take it’s place. You can see it all

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.649
happens very quickly, so be sure you’re
pouring fast enough to keep the funnel full,

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:33.149
but slow enough to stop when it’s done.
Let everything cool for around 10 minutes,

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:37.200
and the metal should be hard enough to grip
onto with a pair of pliers. So pull it up

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.060
out of the sand, and you’ll see your styrofoam
creation has just transformed into solid aluminum,

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.030
almost like magic. If you want to make it
look nicer, you can clean up the rough edges

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.979
with a file and some sand paper, and that’s
how simple it is to make anything you can

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:55.030
think of, into solid metal. By the way, this
also works with housing insulation as well.

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.479
I put a pink foam sword into the sand, and
10 minutes later pulled out an identical copy

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:04.049
cast in solid aluminum. Well that’s it for
now. If you like this video, perhaps you’ll

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.349
like some of my others. Check them out at
