00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:01.810
Welcome back.

00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:04.820
So where we had left off, we
said, OK, we have this angle

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:07.720
here, can we figure out if
any of these angles

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:08.930
are equal to it?

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:14.750
Well we know that alternate
interior angles on-- this is a

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.780
transversal line right here,
and these are parallel lines.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:18.940
So we know alternate interior.

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:21.320
So this is an interior and it's
alternate interior is here.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.340
So we know they
equal each other.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.520
I'm not going to draw it yet,
because sometimes if you forget

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.680
alternate interior you could
just remember, well,

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.460
corresponding angles
equal each other.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.410
So you could say that
that angle is also

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.880
equal to this angle.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.460
And then you can use opposite
angles again to kind of get

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.660
back to the alternate interior.

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:38.490
I'll show you.

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:40.900
The great thing about math is
it's good for people who have

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.520
trouble memorizing things,
because you have to just

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.530
memorize a few things and
then everything else just

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:46.520
kind of falls out of it.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:47.220
But anyway.

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.020
So we figured out that
this angle is the

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.440
same as this angle.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:52.650
Right?

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.550
Because they're alternate
interior angles.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:00.320
And this is its
corresponding side.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.030
And then finally, what
about this angle here?

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.270
I'm going to draw
a triple angle.

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:08.640
One, two, three.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.400
What is that one equal
to on this triangle?

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.230
Well, same reason.

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:15.990
Alternate interior angles of
two parallel lines-- and

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.420
remember, the only reason we
can kind of make this claim is

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.810
because I told you at the
beginning that this line right

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.030
here and this line right
here are parallel.

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.310
Right?

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.330
Otherwise, you couldn't
make this claim.

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.010
But since they are alternate
interior we know that

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:34.570
this is the same angle.

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:35.560
All right.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.080
So we now have shown that
these are similar triangles.

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:40.630
And I didn't have to
do all three angles.

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.960
I could have just done two, and
that should have been good

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.380
enough for you to know
that they're similar.

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.180
Because if two are the
same then the third also

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:47.370
has to be the same.

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:49.740
And now let's see if we can
use this information to

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.980
figure out our ratios.

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:53.560
So let's see.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.040
Let's color the sides the
same side as the angle so

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.980
we don't get confused.

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:02.970
So this side is
the orange side.

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.800
Right?

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:05.810
This side is the blue.

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:06.390
This side is the red.

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.650
OK.

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.810
So we have everything
color coded.

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.320
And it might be confusing you
but it's useful, because, as

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.220
we'll see, these triangles are
actually kind of flipped.

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.290
So let's see what we can do.

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.470
So we need to figure out
this orange side here.

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.980
So this orange side
here, let's call it x.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.850
So x equals question mark.

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.820
This orange side here
corresponds to this side here.

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:32.000
Right?

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.730
Because it's opposite
this angle, which is

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.090
equal to this angle.

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.760
So they're opposite
to the same angle.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.940
So that's how we know they
correspond to each other.

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:47.960
So we could say x
over 6 is equal to.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.260
And now, what other
sides do we know?

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.410
Well we know this side
here-- we know this 4 side.

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.240
Let me do it in that color.

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.310
We know this side is 4.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.570
And since we've put x in the
numerator on the left-hand

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:03.070
side, and 4 is in the same
triangle as this x we're trying

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:04.900
to figure out, we'll put 4 in
the numerator on the

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.590
right-hand side.

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.250
4 over what?

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:10.880
Well what side
corresponds to 4?

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.290
What is opposite this
angle right here?

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:15.000
Well it's this angle.

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.050
Right?

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:24.690
So the corresponding side of
this side is this side-- is 5.

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.310
And now we can solve.

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.010
x is equal-- we just
multiply both sides by 6.

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.310
So you get 24 over 5.

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.745
x is equal to 24 over 5.

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.040
Not too bad.

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.650
And then we could
even go further.

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.170
We can now figure out what
this side is right here.

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:45.770
This magenta side.

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:48.340
Let's call that,
I don't know, y.

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.000
Not too creative here.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.250
Well y corresponds
to this angle.

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.550
So y corresponds
to this 8 side.

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:57.060
Right?

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:03.120
So we could do y over 8 is
equal to-- oh, we could

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.680
do a bunch of things.

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.090
We could say 4 over 5 or we
could do-- let's do 4 over 5,

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.870
because we could do 24 over
5 over 6 and that's

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:10.520
kind of confusing.

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:11.980
So we could also do
that [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.380
over 4 over 5.

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.000
Multiply both sides by 8.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:24.770
And you get y is equal
to 8 times 4, is what?

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:27.160
32 over 5.

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.825
And the reason why I did this
example is because I want

00:04:33.825 --> 00:04:37.170
to show you that you
can't just eyeball.

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:39.860
Sometimes you can, if you get
good at it, but it's not always

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.710
completely obvious which sides
correspond to which sides.

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:45.612
It might have been tempting to
say that, I don't know, this

00:04:45.612 --> 00:04:48.270
side corresponds to this
side or that this side

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:49.500
corresponds to this side.

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.150
But you really have to pay
attention to which side kind of

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.000
matches up with which angles.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.180
So any side that matches up
with a certain angle, that same

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:02.610
angle in the other triangle,
whatever side is opposite that,

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.300
that's its corresponding side.

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.800
I use a lot of words, but
hopefully you have a

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.670
bit of an intuition.

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:12.230
Let's do another one.

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:16.970
First, let's take a triangle
and prove to ourselves that the

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:18.160
two triangles are similar.

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:21.800
I like these parallel lines.

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.830
Let me do two parallel
lines again.

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:28.520
And then this time
around-- let's see.

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.480
I'm going to draw.

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:34.450
There's a line.

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:35.300
There we go.

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:41.240
First, I said these
are parallel lines.

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:45.110
So let me mark them as such.

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:46.220
Parallel lines.

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:49.990
So what we want to do is we
want to prove that this

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:58.300
triangle right here is similar
to the bigger triangle-- is

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.310
similar to this triangle.

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:01.190
This is pretty interesting.

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:02.490
They actually overlap.

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:02.830
Right?

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:10.970
So first of all, do we know any
angles of the two triangles

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:12.420
that equal each other?

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:13.010
Well, sure.

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:13.880
They have this angle.

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:16.730
They actually both share the
same exact angle in common.

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:17.230
Right?

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:20.250
Because the two triangles
overlap at that point.

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:22.000
So what else can we figure out?

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.950
So let's see.

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:25.530
I mean, I don't to be
tacky without any

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:26.930
colors, but let's see.

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:31.550
We have this angle here.

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:33.470
And what other angles are
equal to this angle?

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:37.320
Well, we can use our parallel
lines and transversal of

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:42.350
angle rules, or theorems or
whatever, and figure it out.

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:44.860
Well this angle
corresponds to what?

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:46.620
Well, it corresponds
to this angle.

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:48.320
So it's equivalent.

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:49.750
And you got that from
your parallel lines.

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:50.090
Right?

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:52.000
So these two are the same.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.150
And then, finally, if I have--
let me pick a good color-- if I

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:59.550
have this angle, draw
a triple angle here.

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:00.110
Same thing.

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:02.610
This corresponding angle is
going to be right here.

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:05.830
So there.

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:10.450
We know all of the three angles
of this triangle are the same.

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:11.760
So this is a similar triangle.

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:18.780
Let's say we know that this
side right here-- I'll give

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:19.920
you a little trick question.

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:24.430
From here to here is 5.

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:29.530
And from here to here is 7.

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:46.825
From here to here is-- I
don't know; make up a

00:07:46.825 --> 00:07:49.820
good number-- is 12.

00:07:49.820 --> 00:08:01.430
And from here to here
is, let me say, 6.

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:04.920
And I wanted to figure
out what this is.

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:06.080
How do we do that?

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:08.720
And I've further made it more
confusing by adding all

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:10.050
these squiggly lines.

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:11.460
Well, we already know
that these are two

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:12.460
similar triangles.

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:14.910
So we can use that information
to do our ratios.

00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:20.110
So if we call this
is equal to x.

00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:21.700
Right?

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:23.320
So what do we know?

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:31.350
We know that this whole side
corresponds to what side

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:33.250
on the smaller triangle?

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:34.580
Well, it corresponds
to this side.

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:34.820
Right?

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:37.085
It corresponds to here.

00:08:37.085 --> 00:08:39.220
So let me draw it in
the correct color.

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:42.780
So if we do the orange, this
orange corresponds to this.

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:44.030
Right?

00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:47.190
Well this orange corresponds
to the whole thing.

00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:49.900
It corresponds to
this whole line.

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:52.770
So if we take the big
triangle, the big triangle

00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:54.210
side is not just x.

00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:54.490
Right?

00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:55.875
Because that's not the whole
side of the triangle.

00:08:55.875 --> 00:08:56.933
It's x plus 5.

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:02.060
That's this whole side.

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:02.450
Right?

00:09:06.116 --> 00:09:11.340
x plus 5 over the corresponding
side on the smaller triangle.

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:12.660
Well, on the corresponding
side of the smaller

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:14.630
triangle it's just this.

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:16.610
It's over 5.

00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:17.870
Right?

00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:22.180
Is equal to-- and then
we could say, well, 12.

00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:25.740
Is equal to 12, because this
corresponds to this angle

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:27.332
on the big triangle.

00:09:27.332 --> 00:09:30.540
Is equal to 12 over what?

00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:33.980
Over 6, because this is
the smaller triangle.

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:34.930
And then we could
solve for that.

00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:35.900
This becomes 2.

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:36.860
Right?

00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:40.936
You get x plus 5
is equal to 10.

00:09:40.936 --> 00:09:43.530
x is equal to 5.

00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:46.300
There you go.

00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:48.560
That's all the time
I have for now.

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:51.540
I hope I helped you
understand similar triangles

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:52.580
just a little bit.

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:54.720
I'll see you soon.
