00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.415
The discovery that Jackie and Alex were only

00:00:02.415 --> 00:00:06.350
25% related completely changed their relationship. Instead of being

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:09.790
full siblings, they're 50% related. Meaning they share 50%

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:14.230
identity by descent. They were only 25% related. Now

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:16.010
this means that Alex would have to be her

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.940
grandparent, her aunt or uncle, or possibly her half

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.590
sibling. Now in this case it only made sense

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.810
that Alex was Jackie's half-sibling. This means they shared

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.780
a mother and not a father. The discovery that Jackie made was

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:33.380
that the father who raised her was not in fact her biological father.
