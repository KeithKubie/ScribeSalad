00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.260
Suppose you sit in a beer garden.

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:08.280
Beautiful weather. And you have ordered the beer. The beer comes.

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:14.420
They put it on the table and then you touch the table, and the table is unstable,

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.440
and the beer spread out.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:18.920
And you are angry.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.000
It's a four-leg table, it's completely stable.

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.640
The problem is the ground on which the table stands.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.120
This is not flat.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.040
And that's why one leg is above the ground

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.480
and then if you put your hands against the table, it goes down.

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.580
And it's the unstability of the table.

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:42.200
The moment solution is: we take a sheet of paper,

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.720
for example, this paper which is under our beer glass,

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.280
and put it under this leg.

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.480
And for a while, it looks ok.

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.700
But after a few minutes, we are angry again,

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.080
because this paper has compressed a little bit,

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.940
and, instability again.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.040
And we hate that.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.840
Mathematicians never have unstable tables.

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.700
They know what to do.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.560
And what you do is very very simple.

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.100
Turn the table.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.160
You start moving the table

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.340
and try to turn it, so that you have a quarter of a turn.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.860
And on the way of your turning, there will be a moment where it's absolutely stable.

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:33.640
- So you just rotate it, like rotating a disk?
Yes, I rotate the table like a disk.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.300
And typically, only a few centimeters are needed

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.140
and suddendly it's stable.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.280
And this is not by chance,

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:47.840
there is a mathematical proof that this will always happen.

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.300
- You are going to have to give me that proof now.
I'll give that proof now.

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:58.540
Here is the ground.

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:03.120
And here, there is the position of the 4 legs.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.180
And we enumerate them.

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.480
This is the leg 1.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.680
This is leg 2. This is leg 3.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:09.980
This is leg 4.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.200
And suppose that leg 1 is above the floor.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.080
Where these 3 are fixed on the ground.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.120
Now, of course, if we put pressure on one, then we see the unstability.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.280
And now, we do the following:

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.980
we measure the height of leg 1.

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.100
Remember, we always measure the height of leg 1.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:43.220
So, if we do that in time, then we get associate to time t,

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:49.980
we associate height of leg 1.

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.840
So, at time 0 we get some...

00:02:53.620 --> 00:03:01.740
t = 0, we get some number, say x larger than 0.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.300
Nothing was happening.

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:09.880
Now, we start moving, and we do that, obviously in time.

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:15.900
And at each time, we measure the height of leg 1.

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.000
And we turn it in this way.

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:25.380
So, we turn it so that we try to bring leg 1 into the position of leg 2.

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.960
At each time, we measure the height of leg 1.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.500
So this gives a function f(t).

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.700
For each time t, we measure.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.080
Here is something important:

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.620
It can happen that,

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.000
if we always fix 2, 3 and 4...

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.640
This, you remember. We fix 2, 3 and 4.

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:56.360
And now it could happen that the height of leg 1 is negative.

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:07.140
This really happen, if we have put now leg 1 into position of leg 2,

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.940
leg 2 to the position of leg 3,

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:13.180
leg 3 to the position of 4,

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.620
and leg 4 is at the position where leg 1 was.

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:22.980
But now, remember 
that we fixed the position of 2, 3 and 4.

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:26.560
I fix them on the ground, I keep them on the ground.

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.140
And since... When we did it here, at this position,

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.440
this was above the ground.

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.480
And now we force these 3 to be on the ground.

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:42.540
That means this position has to be under the ground.

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.260
You see that, before we have fixed these 3, it's above.

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.200
Now you force this to go down.

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.760
And this is, suddenly, under the ground.

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:55.960
So, at time 1...

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:01.260
Let's suppose we take time 1, until we had this position.

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:06.700
So, at t=1, this height is negative.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.820
So now, we draw.. if I get a new sheet of paper...

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:25.340
Now we draw this curve.

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.160
This is time 0, this is time 1...

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.800
Here we draw the height...

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.400
And, at time 0, the height was something positive.

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:39.560
And at time 1, the height was negative

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:46.040
So this is f(0), this is f(1).

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:51.040
And now, at each time t, we get the position of the height.

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.860
And you see we get a curve...

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.900
It might go even up and down,

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:01.560
but in the very end, it has to end here.

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:07.360
And now comes a famous theorem of mathematics: 
the mean value theorem...

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.040
[correction: intermediate value theorem]

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:15.580
Which just says that, if we have a continuous function, which is positive here and negative here,

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:19.560
there must be a position where it is zero.

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:22.080
[Brady] It could be multiple?
[Matthias] It could be.

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:28.020
You can have fun with it: you turn your table further and then it might be a second position where it's stable.

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:32.560
You don't need that, but it's fun to try that out, if you're in the beer garden.

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:38.480
And if you do it, the next time on the beer garden 
you will see: easily fixed the table.

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:41.240
And you will be pleased, and the beer tastes even better.

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:46.280
I do it all the time.

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:50.700
Whenever I'm in the beer garden, or even in a restaurant, or if the ground is not flat.

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:56.280
And I sit there with my friends, and they are saying..

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:59.420
"Let's put this under..."
And I say: "Don't do it"

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:01.580
I move it just a little bit.

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:03.620
And they're always very surprised.

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:07.240
And it really not change. Then it's fixed for the whole evening.

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:10.240
- What if the table are all lined up, or a special shape or something?

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:14.940
Oh, that's... Of course, the mathematics is always theoretical.

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:21.080
So, if you cannot move the table, you'll have to use the old traditional thing with the paper.
