00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.669
Anthony: It turns out psychopaths don't lack
empathy.

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.279
Lee: They're just regular jerks.

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:13.290
Anthony: Anthony here for Dnews, with Lee
Newton again from Sourcefed.

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:14.290
Lee: Hi!

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:15.290
Anthony: Oh hello again.

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:18.861
So you know, Lee, one of the things that we've
always thought about psychopaths is that they

00:00:18.861 --> 00:00:20.780
lack the ability to feel empathy.

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:23.850
Lee: Uh, do you remember when you slammed
the door in my face earlier.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:24.850
Anthony: No I do not.

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:29.130
Lee: As recently as 2011, studies show that
your garden-variety Dexter or Hannibal, had

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.600
the same difficulty accessing parts of the
brain responsible for emotional functioning,

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.679
as people with frontal lobe injuries.

00:00:35.679 --> 00:00:37.789
But now they're thinking that that's not the
case.

00:00:37.789 --> 00:00:39.949
A study published by the University of Groningen.

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:41.020
Anthony: From the Lord of the Rings.

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:42.020
Lee: No no.

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:43.020
Just from the Netherlands.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.800
Says that psychopaths can access those emotions
just fine, they just need to be trained to.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.350
Anthony: 26 control subjects and 18 criminals
with psychopathy were hooked up to a say with

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.350
me now...

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:54.440
[Together] fMRI

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:00.039
and asked to watch clips of hands touching
in either a painful, loving or neutral way.

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:04.610
In a control group neurons associated with
the mirror system in the brain fired off.

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.969
It's been speculated that that's the part
that lets you watch someone do something and

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:09.969
understand it.

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:12.020
It's important for learning and for empathy.

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.540
In the eighteen psychopaths, none of that
stuff fired, as expected.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.850
Lee: The team asked them to watch again and
asked every time to try and imagine how the

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.000
people in the videos felt, and the mirror
system actually turned on.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.329
The team believes that means people with psychopathy
copy could potentially turn on their empathy

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:31.840
at will, and maybe even train that empathy
into the same automatic response that most

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:32.840
people have.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.340
Anthony: Other scientists say it's kind of
a jump from seeing activity in a section the

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.789
brain and then actually feeling an emotion
that's associated with that section.

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:44.260
And even if these guys could feel empathy,
what would make them decide to consciously

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:45.400
try to make a habit of it?

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.720
Lee: Well Dexter did it.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.990
Anthony: Dexter is not real and also he still
kills people.

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.270
Lee: Dexter's just a single dad trying his
best man.

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.780
Anthony: Fair enough Lee Newton.

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.310
Hey, Lee Newton you are here instead of Laci
Green.

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:59.310
Lee: I am.

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.240
Anthony: And Laci Green is on Sourcefed.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.399
Lee: Instead of me.

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.440
Anthony: Ok so if people wanna see Laci Green
over the next couple days, where do they go

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.440
to do that?

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:07.440
Lee: Sourcefed.com

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.020
Anthony: There you go and you can subscribe
here for more Dnews.
