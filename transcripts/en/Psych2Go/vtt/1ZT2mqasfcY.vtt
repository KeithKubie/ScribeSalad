00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:02.660
Relationships can be tricky.

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:05.580
They're amazing when they're going well but if something happens

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.740
and you're on a rocky road, they can be painful.

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:11.540
If you've been with someone a long time, you can start

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:13.000
to get stuck in a routine.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.600
You might not necessarily notice the behavior of the other half

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.640
because it's becoming the norm to you.

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:22.080
Taking a step back and looking at your relationship

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.100
from a different viewpoint can be really beneficial

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.780
and help you gain perspective on a scenario.

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.080
There is no perfect relationship.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.760
Even the happiest of couples have arguments,

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.440
disagreements, and temporary breakups.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:37.640
That's life!

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.500
But there is a time when you have to look at your relationship

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.815
without rose tinted glasses and see if those small arguments

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.380
are actually escalating into massive rows

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.760
Sometimes you have to leave a relationship and put yourself

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:52.820
first to be happy

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:54.240
So Psych2Go shares

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.580
5 signs that tell you when it's time to leave a relationship

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.000
1. You're consistently unhappy

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.060
Any relationship, be it friends, family, or romantic

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.800
should bring you happiness.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.660
You should look forward to seeing your partner

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.700
and enjoy spending time with them

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.680
Obviously, you can't be consistently happy in a relationship

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.020
because that's not realistic

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.340
but you should feel supported, safe, and loved.

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.500
If you start to feel consistently unhappy,

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.140
maybe it's time to ask yourself why.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.780
Maybe it's you or maybe your partner.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.440
It's good to understand why you're feeling unhappy

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.300
so you can either fix the problem or choose to leave.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.300
There is no shame to admit that your relationship is not

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.235
offering you the same support and contentment

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.060
that it once was.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.060
2. You're travelling on different paths.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.120
Sometimes you can start a relationship in one place

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.080
but as you grow, you can change mindsets.

00:01:54.085 --> 00:01:57.285
Long term relationships can be amazing as you grow

00:01:57.285 --> 00:01:59.295
and change with your partner.

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.200
But sometimes you can grow and change at a different

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.700
rate to your partner.

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.260
If you're moving in different directions to your partner,

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.740
it can be difficult to navigate a relationship.

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.700
Also if you're in a different place emotionally, you might

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.240
not want the same things.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.360
In this case it's best for both of you to separate amicably

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.680
It's a good thing to discuss what each of you wants from

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.920
a relationship if you're going to be serious about a partner.

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.180
3. Lack of support.

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.040
In a relationship, support is key.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.620
You want to feel that your partner believes in what you're doing.

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.820
and is behind you 100%

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.960
but if that support isn't there,

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.120
you can start to feel let down and unfulfilled.

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.880
Emotional support is also really important.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.140
If you're not feeling that in a relationship,

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.020
it can be damaging and affect your happiness.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.580
If you don't feel like your partner is invested in you

00:02:48.585 --> 00:02:51.475
and is behind you all the way,

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.040
then it might be time to consider having a conversation

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.980
about your relationship with your partner.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.420
4. Abuse of any sort.

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.900
By this I mean emotional, physical, sexual,

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.920
financial, and so on.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.800
If your partner has abused you in any way,

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.040
then this is a clear sign you should at least consider leaving.

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:13.620
Abuse is very damaging

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.460
and the abuser can often try [to] convince you to stay in the relationship

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.780
If this is the case, you should leave for your own safety.

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.860
It can be very difficult to leave a relationship like that

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:27.240
but there are hotlines available to contact should you need to

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.780
Remember, you're not alone in this.

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.880
5. Lack of trust.

00:03:32.885 --> 00:03:36.315
The foundation of all relationships should be trust.

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.380
The trust between you and your partner should be strong.

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.020
If it isn't, that could mean you doubt their actions.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.020
As a result, this could possibly lead to jealousy.

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.660
If you don't trust your partner, you could work on it and try to rebuild it.

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.180
Losing trust is often a sign that something is

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.380
wrong within your relationship

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.220
and you'll need to address it.

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.620
However, if you're past the rebuilding phase,

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.860
maybe your partner betrayed your trust too many times.

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.060
Ending the relationship could be a possibility.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.400
There is no shame in admitting you can't be with someone

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.020
you don't fully trust.

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.620
It's all about what makes you happy.
