00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now the next question is what representation for states should we use

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
if we want to generalize this problem.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
So that we're given an initial state when there can be any number of missionaries,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
cannibals, and boats on one side of the river

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and any number on the other.

00:00:15.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Which of these representations is sufficient under those conditions?
