00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:03.300
Adriene: Hi, this is Crash Course Economics,
I’m Adriene Hill.

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:06.640
Jacob: And I’m Jacob Clifford. So, when
economists make their models, they generally

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.590
assume that people are rational and predictable.

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:12.780
Adriene: But when we look at actual human
beings, it turns out that people are impulsive,

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.789
shortsighted, and, a lot of times, just plain
irrational. Look! Balloons!

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.009
Jacob: Today we’re talking about Behavioral
Economics and how people actually make decisions.

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:31.049
[Theme Music]

00:00:31.049 --> 00:00:35.920
Behavioral economics is a subfield of economics
that focuses on the psychological, social,

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.580
and emotional factors that influence decision-making.
That's not necessarily new. In fact, our old

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.510
buddy Adam Smith, discussed it in The Theory
of Moral Sentiments in 1759.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.510
But generations of economists chose to ignore
many irrational elements of decision making

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.480
since it makes it harder to predict human
behavior.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.320
But in the last few decades, behavioral economics
has made a comeback. Several Nobel Prizes

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.719
have been awarded to researchers that blend
economics and psychology and behavioral economics

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:04.239
is being applied to more and more fields like
marketing, finance, political science, and public policy.

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.890
Now it’s important to mention that irrational
human behavior doesn’t negate everything

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.840
you’ve learned here at Crash Course Economics.
It just adds another layer of complexity,

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.369
which is exactly what we love at Crash Course

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:18.049
Now in most cases, people are rational. When
the price falls for a product, people have a tendancy

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:22.530
to buy more of that product, so the law of
demand holds true. But economists also accept

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.810
that there is bounded rationality. Limits
on information, time, and abilities might

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.439
prevent people from seeking out the best possible
outcome.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.840
For example, if the price for ice cream is
really low consumers might not buy more.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.420
In fact, they might buy less if they think that that
low price means that ice cream tastes horrible.

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.540
Now if that happens, then the law of demand doesn’t hold true, which creates a serious problem in classical economics.

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.220
I mean it is the LAW of demand. You can’t
have a situation that breaks the law and still

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.860
call it a law. That doesn’t happen in other
disciplines like physics…except it does.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.040
The Newtonian laws of physics, like gravity,
hold true most of the time but they break

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.689
down at the quantum level. They explain the
orbits of planets, but they have a harder

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:01.280
time explaining the orbits of electrons

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.060
And It’s the same in economics. Classical
economic theories explain the big picture

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.810
stuff pretty well, but there are still a lot
of things about individual decision-making

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.560
that we just don’t fully understand.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.239
Adriene: In our ice cream example one of the
problems is lack of information. Classical

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:20.319
economics assumes that consumers have perfect
information when making choices. That is,

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:26.299
they know or at least can quickly access information
about prices and quality, but, in reality, they often don’t.

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.860
Sure, the consumer could ask around or call
their friends to see if they’ve tried that

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.249
type of ice cream but they're probably not
gonna do that. In this situation, consumers

00:02:34.249 --> 00:02:39.669
may act on the limited information they have,
a suspiciously low price, which means either

00:02:39.669 --> 00:02:44.349
the ice cream is a great deal or it tastes
like mayonnaise. They just don’t know.

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:49.239
Prices do send a lot of signals, and there’s
even science on how prices change perception.

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:54.870
A study in California analyzed the brains
of people taste testing a variety of red wines.

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:01.320
The researchers gave participants fake prices and scanned their brains to determine the level of enjoyment.

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:06.160
The results were surprising. When they thought the price was higher, they actually liked the wine more.

00:03:06.169 --> 00:03:09.589
This held true even when the subjects were
given the exact same type of wine but were

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:15.370
told it was a different higher-priced wine.
The researchers said "Contrary to the basic

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:21.430
assumptions of economics…marketing actions
can successfully affect experienced pleasantness

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.680
by manipulating non-intrinsic attributes of
goods.”

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:29.309
So, once you’ve got a palatable Pinot Noir,
you might be able to raise the price, and

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:33.540
actually raise the demand. All you have to
do is change perceptions.

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.800
The idea that perceptions and passions
influence our actions also applies in finance.

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:44.340
Many economists used to believe that assets, like
stocks and real estate, would stay at or near

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:49.839
their real value because cold, calculating
investors would buy undervalued assets and

00:03:49.839 --> 00:03:54.099
sell overvalued assets. But that doesn’t
explain bubbles:

00:03:54.100 --> 00:04:00.000
In real life, investors aren’t always cold and calculating. They can get worked up and irrational sometimes.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.020
This helps explain bubbles. From the Dutch Tulip Mania
of the 17th century, to the 2008 financial crisis.

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:11.580
Investors became irrationally exuberant,
and were driven not by logic, but by what

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.100
economist John Maynard Keynes
once called, “Animal Spirits.”

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:20.280
So behavioral economics doesn’t blow up traditional economic theory, it just seeks to understand

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:26.140
when and why people behave differently than economic models suggest. Let’s go the Thought Bubble:

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:30.280
Jacob: One of the most popular experiments in
behavioral economics is called the ultimatum game.

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.840
In this experiment, two players decide how to
share a specific sum of money, let’s say $100.

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.720
The first player is given all the money and then is asked to propose a way of splitting it with the second player.

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.400
Now if the second player accepts the deal
both players get to keep the money.

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.319
But, if the second player refuses,
nobody gets to keep the money.

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:51.159
When the first player offers to split the money
50/50 the second player almost always accepts.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.480
But what happens when the first player
offers an unequal split, like 80/20?

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:58.420
Would you accept that offer? Well, It turns out
that less equal offers are often rejected.

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:03.340
Now that doesn’t seem surprising, but it directly contradicts classical economic theory. It’s irrational.

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:07.720
The rational choice would be for the second
player to accept any offer, even if it's only a dollar.

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:12.440
After all, a dollar is better than nothing.
But human behavior is not motivated solely by gain;

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.860
it’s also shaped by complex ideas like
fairness, injustice, and even revenge.

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:21.000
The ultimatum game shows that people aren’t always as predictable as many economists like to suggest.

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:24.409
If people were entirely rational then they
would consistently make the same decision

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:28.620
given identical options, but sometimes people's
preferences are dependent on how the options

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.440
are presented. Psychologists call this type
of cognitive bias the Framing Effect.

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:37.520
I mean, would you rather eat beef that's 75%
fat free or 25% fat? Would you rather enter

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:41.500
a raffle that claims that 1 out of every 1000
players is a winner or a raffle that points

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:46.280
out that there will be 999 losers. Would you
support a law named the “Improve our Schools Act”

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.259
or one named the “Raise our Taxes
Act”?

00:05:48.259 --> 00:05:52.810
Each of these scenarios can be framed in ways
that influence your decision. Classical economics

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:56.189
argues that framing should have relatively
little effect on decision making because most

00:05:56.189 --> 00:06:00.380
people are rational and intelligent, but in
the real world, people can be pretty irrational.

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:04.460
Adriene: Thanks Thought Bubble. So, Businesses
have known about the psychology of decision

00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:09.280
making for a long time. For example, a gym
might break down its membership fee and advertise

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:15.100
it only costs only $1 a day, which seems
way more affordable than $365 a year.

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:21.120
And a TV priced at $499.99 seems like a
better deal than one priced at $500.

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:25.880
This is called psychological pricing. It can
make people feel like they’re getting a good deal.

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:31.180
Interestingly, high-end retailers sometimes
do the opposite. They set their prices at whole

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:36.620
dollars, basically signalling their goods are of a higher quality than you might see at a discount store.

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:42.439
Behavioral economists also like to talk about
nudge theory. Nudges encourage people to act

00:06:42.439 --> 00:06:46.379
a certain way, without actually changing the
choices that are available to them.

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:51.099
Fighting childhood obesity is a priority in
many countries and policy makers have suggested

00:06:51.099 --> 00:06:56.639
a whole range of solutions. Everything from
banning soda in schools to running media campaigns

00:06:56.639 --> 00:07:01.699
promoting healthy eating. Behavioral economists
approached the problem a little differently.

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:06.120
They wanted to see if they could get children
to eat healthier by rearranging school cafeterias.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:10.520
They put healthier food like fruits and vegetables
on eye-level shelves and less healthy foods,

00:07:10.529 --> 00:07:16.029
like desserts, in less convenient places.
Classical economic theory suggests that this

00:07:16.029 --> 00:07:19.549
idea wouldn’t work since rational people
would pick the brownie.

00:07:19.549 --> 00:07:25.349
But it turns out, students choose the healthier foods.
Nudge theory works and it’s changing how we

00:07:25.349 --> 00:07:30.720
implement public policy. There are some issues that
can be addressed best with the right type of nudge.

00:07:30.729 --> 00:07:35.189
Jacob: Let’s talk about something else behavioral
economists look at: risk. Let’s say someone

00:07:35.189 --> 00:07:39.719
offered you two sealed envelopes. One has
a hundred dollars, and one has no dollars.

00:07:39.719 --> 00:07:43.159
You can choose an envelope, or you can
take $50 cash right now.

00:07:43.159 --> 00:07:46.319
So do you take the fifty bucks?
Or what about $49?

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:50.180
Now, this is unlikely to happen to you in
real life, but the exercise is about your

00:07:50.189 --> 00:07:56.150
attitude towards risk. Since there’s a 50/50
chance of getting $100 or nothing, the expected

00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:58.819
return, or the average of the possible outcomes
is $50.

00:07:58.819 --> 00:08:03.319
If you’re willing to accept $50 cash to
abandon the envelopes, then you’re risk neutral.

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:08.440
But If you accept less than $50, just to avoid walking away with nothing, then you’re risk-averse.

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:12.659
Behavioral economists have done lots of studies
about risk and in particular loss aversion,

00:08:12.659 --> 00:08:16.949
the idea that people strongly want to avoid
losing. Studies show that, in general, losses

00:08:16.949 --> 00:08:21.569
are more painful than gains are pleasurable.
So people might choose a safe course of action

00:08:21.569 --> 00:08:23.620
even if it’s not the most logical choice.

00:08:23.629 --> 00:08:29.189
Let’s say we flip a coin and if it’s heads I give you $100 but if it’s tails, you have to give me $50.

00:08:29.189 --> 00:08:33.879
Now, mathematically you should go for it. But many people won’t because they want to avoid losing.

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:39.020
Adriene: Understanding of loss aversion can help businesses and policymakers influence decisions.

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:44.720
For example, some grocery stores
in the Washington DC tried to decrease the

00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:51.230
use of disposable plastic bags by offering five cent bonuses if customers brought reusable bags.

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:56.860
The policy didn’t do that much. Later they
tried a five-cent tax on plastic bags, and,

00:08:56.860 --> 00:09:02.959
this time, people used fewer disposable bags.
This is loss aversion at work. The pain of

00:09:02.959 --> 00:09:08.899
having to pay 5 cents per bag was greater
than the benefit of receiving 5 cents per bag.

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:14.660
Another study analyzed how loss aversion can
help incentivise employees. Researchers divided

00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:19.170
workers into three groups. The first was a
control group that wasn’t given a bonus.

00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:24.050
The second group was promised a bonus at the
end of the year based on meeting specific goals.

00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:28.079
Participants in third group were given the
bonus at the beginning of the year and were

00:09:28.079 --> 00:09:32.199
told that they would have to pay it back if
they didn’t meet specific goals.

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:36.460
The workers in the first and second groups
performed about the same.

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:41.280
But those in the third group performed
significantly better. We just hate losing.

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:45.020
Jacob: So, behavioral economics has a lot
to tell us. Accounting for emotion gives

00:09:45.029 --> 00:09:47.550
us a realistic view of how people actually
behave.

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:52.780
Adriene: We might not always be the rational
actors classical economists believe us to be.

00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:57.740
For years, economics has had a blind spot.
But behavioral economics helps us get a better

00:09:57.740 --> 00:09:59.720
look at how we make decisions.
