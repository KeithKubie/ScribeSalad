00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:02.140
We're asked to solve
the proportion.

00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:07.290
We have 8 36ths is
equal to 10 over what.

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.584
Or the ratio of 8/36 is equal
to the ratio of 10 to what.

00:00:11.584 --> 00:00:13.750
And there's a bunch of
different ways to solve this.

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:16.540
And I'll explore
really all of them,

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:17.810
or a good selection of them.

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:19.900
So one way to think about
it is, these two need

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.460
to be equivalent ratios, or
really, equivalent fractions.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.240
So whatever happened
to the numerator also

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.420
has to happen to
the denominator.

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.400
So what do we have to
multiply 8 by to get 10?

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.560
Well you could
multiply 8 times 10/8.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.660
It will definitely give you 10.

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.340
So we're multiplying
by 10/8 over here.

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.340
Or another way to write 10/8,
10/8 is the same thing as 5/4.

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.417
So we're multiplying by 5/4
to get to 10, from 8 to 10.

00:00:49.417 --> 00:00:51.000
Well, if we did that
to the numerator,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.270
in order to have an
equivalent fraction,

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:54.440
you have to do the same
thing to the denominator.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.100
You have to multiply it.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.030
You have to multiply
it times 5/4.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.110
And so we could say this n, this
thing that we just solved for,

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:08.202
this n is going to be equal
to 36 times 5 divided by 4.

00:01:08.202 --> 00:01:09.660
Or you could say
that this is going

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:14.080
to be equal to 36
times 5 divided by 4.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.340
And now, 36 divided by
4, we know what that is.

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.640
We could divide both the
numerator and the denominator

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:20.410
by 4.

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.660
You divide the numerator
by 4, you get 9.

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:24.950
Divide the denominator
by 4 you get 1.

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.991
You get 45.

00:01:26.991 --> 00:01:28.490
So that's one way
to think about it.

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.575
8/36 is equal to 10/45.

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.910
Another way to
think about it is,

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.750
what do we have to multiply
8 by to get its denominator.

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.300
How much larger is the
denominator 36 than 8?

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.540
Well let's just divide 36/8.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:53.170
So 36/8 is the same
thing as-- so we

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.580
can simplify, dividing the
numerator and the denominator

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.320
by 4.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.170
That's the greatest
common divisor.

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.480
That's the same thing as 9/2.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.080
So if you multiply
the numerator by 9/2,

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.640
you get the denominator.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.527
So we're multiplying by 9/2 to
get the denominator over here.

00:02:09.527 --> 00:02:11.610
Well, then we have to do
the same thing over here.

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:17.510
If 36 is 9/2 times
8, let me write this.

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:24.480
8 times 9/2 is equal to 36.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.980
Right?

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.980
That's how we go from the
numerator to the denominator.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.790
Then to figure out what
the denominator here

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.165
is, if we want
the same fraction,

00:02:30.165 --> 00:02:33.320
we have to multiply
by 9/2 again.

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:39.880
So then we'll get 10 times
9/2 is going to be equal to n,

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.290
is going to be equal
to this denominator.

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.474
And so this is the same
thing as saying 10 times 9/2.

00:02:46.474 --> 00:02:48.390
Divide the numerator and
the denominator by 2,

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.170
you get 5/1, which is 45.

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.480
So 45 is equal to n.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.880
Once again, we got the same
way, completely legitimate way,

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.180
to solve it.

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.990
Now sometimes when you
see proportion like this,

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:05.045
sometimes people say, oh
you can cross-multiply.

00:03:05.045 --> 00:03:06.170
And you can cross-multiply.

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:07.690
And I'll teach you
how to do that.

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.570
And that's sometimes
a quick way to do it.

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.389
But I don't like teaching
it the first time you

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:14.680
look at proportions, because
it's really just something

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:15.260
mechanical.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:16.610
You really don't understand
what you're doing.

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:18.590
And it really comes out of
a little bit of algebra.

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.190
And I'll show you
the algebra as well.

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:21.330
But if you don't
understand it, or if it

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.329
doesn't make as much sense
to you at this point,

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:25.060
don't worry too much about it.

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.860
So we have 8/36
is equal to 10/n.

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.780
When you cross-multiply,
you're saying

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.990
that the numerator here, times
the denominator over here,

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:38.600
is going to be equal
to, so 8 times n,

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:44.060
is going to be equal to
the denominator over here,

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.170
let me just different color,
the denominator over here,

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:48.420
times the numerator over here.

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.190
This is what it means
to cross-multiply.

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.760
So this is going to be
equal to 36 times 10.

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:59.690
Let me do this in a
neutral color now.

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:03.840
You could say that
8n is equal to 360.

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.390
And so you're saying 8
times what is equal to 360.

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:09.090
Or to figure out
what that times what

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.339
is, you divide 360 divided by 8.

00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:13.880
So we could divide, and this is
a little bit of algebra here,

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.529
we're dividing both sides
of the equation by 8.

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:20.574
And we're getting n is
equal to 360 divided by 8.

00:04:20.574 --> 00:04:21.990
You could do that
without thinking

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:23.730
in strict algebraic terms.

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:26.090
You could say 8
times what is 360.

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.980
Well 8 times 360/8.

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:33.620
If I write 8 times question
mark is equal to 360,

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:38.230
well, question mark could
definitely be 360/8.

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:40.890
If I multiply these out, this
guy and that guy cancel out,

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:43.060
and it's definitely 360.

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:44.884
And that's why it's 360/8.

00:04:44.884 --> 00:04:46.300
But now we want
to actually divide

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.690
this to actually get our right
answer, or a simplified answer.

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:55.390
8 goes into 360, 8 goes into
36 4 times, 4 times 8 is 32.

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:56.920
You have a remainder of 4.

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:58.210
Bring down the 0.

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.300
8 goes into 40 5 times.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.430
5 times 8 is 40.

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.444
And then you have no remainder.

00:05:05.444 --> 00:05:06.110
And you're done.

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:10.404
Once again, we got
n is equal to 45.

00:05:10.404 --> 00:05:12.070
Now the last thing
I'm going to show you

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:13.740
involves a little
bit of algebra.

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.990
If any of the ways before
this worked, that's fine.

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:17.590
And where this is
sitting in the playlist,

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:19.280
you're not expected
to know the algebra.

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.070
But I want to show
you the algebra just

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:23.528
because I wanted to show you
that this cross-multiplication

00:05:23.528 --> 00:05:25.380
isn't some magic,
that using algebra,

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:27.450
we will get this
exact same thing.

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:28.930
But you could stop
watching this,

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:31.280
if you'll find this
part confusing.

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:36.340
So let's rewrite our proportion,
8/36 is equal to 10/n.

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:43.390
And we want to solve for n.

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:46.912
Well the easiest way to solve
for n is maybe multiply both--

00:05:46.912 --> 00:05:49.370
this thing on the left is equal
to this thing on the right.

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:51.910
So we can multiply them
both by the same thing.

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:53.500
And the equality
will still hold.

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:57.950
So we could multiply
both of them by n.

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:00.080
On the right-hand side,
the n's cancel out.

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:07.220
On the left-hand side, we have
8/36 times n is equal to 10.

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:11.150
Now if we want to solve for n,
we could literally multiply.

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:12.920
If we want just an
n here, we would

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:15.775
want to multiply
this side times 36--

00:06:15.775 --> 00:06:17.350
I'll do that in a
different color--

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:20.960
we'd want to multiply this
side times 36 times 8,

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.510
because if you multiply
these guys out, you get 1.

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:24.820
And you just have an n.

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:26.778
But since we're doing it
to the left-hand side,

00:06:26.778 --> 00:06:32.170
we also have to do it to the
right-hand side, so times 36/8.

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:35.330
These guys cancel out
and we're left with n

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:40.480
is equal to 10
times 36 is 360/8.

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:43.410
And notice, we're getting
the exact same value

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:45.220
that we got with
cross-multiplying.

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:47.160
And with
cross-multiplying, you're

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:48.500
actually doing two steps.

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:50.250
Actually, you're doing
an extra step here.

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:53.540
You're multiplying both sides
by n, so that you had your 8n.

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:56.110
And then you're multiplying
both sides by 36,

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:59.510
so that you get your
36 on both sides.

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:00.740
And you get this value here.

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:02.281
But at the end, when
you simplify it,

00:07:02.281 --> 00:07:04.330
you'll get the
exact same answer.

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:06.930
So those are all different
ways to solve this proportion.

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:09.340
Probably the most obvious
way, or the easiest way

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:12.345
to do it in your head,
was either just looking

00:07:12.345 --> 00:07:14.220
at what you have to
multiply the numerator by

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:16.830
and then doing the same
thing to the denominator,

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:19.332
or maybe by
cross-multiplication.
