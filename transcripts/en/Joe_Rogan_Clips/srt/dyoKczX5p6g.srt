1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:03,720
Is that my mouth to you this way? Nancy
Hart. Did she speak to you like this?

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:08,810
About positivity and about
my mom reinforced knowledge.

3
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:17,370
My mom reinforced you don't start things
and not finish them. You don't quit.

4
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:22,620
There is nothing that comes out of
quitting besides knowing that you didn't

5
00:00:22,621 --> 00:00:26,280
finish. We finish everything.
You start it, finish it.

6
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,610
If you're going to do it,
do it to try and be the best,

7
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,820
not be better than other people.
Be the best for you.

8
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,270
If you're in school
and you go on to class,

9
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,670
I'm not asking you to get straight A's.

10
00:00:38,671 --> 00:00:42,540
I'm asking you to get the best
grade that you can possibly get.

11
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:47,490
Give me 100% all the time
and I'm a happy mother.

12
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:52,620
When you have fast me, I'm on Yas mom.

13
00:00:52,621 --> 00:00:55,740
I want to do this. I want
to. I want to play baseball.

14
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:57,560
Well then you're going to play mom.

15
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:01,080
I don't like that no more than why'd
you start the season cause I thought I

16
00:01:01,081 --> 00:01:03,690
wanted to do it. Then you can
finish the season. You don't quit.

17
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,850
There's other people that
invested time and energy into you.

18
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:09,750
You don't just quit on people, but I
don't want to do it. Finish the season.

19
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:14,310
I want to swim. Then you're gonna finish
women. It didn't matter what I did,

20
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:19,440
I was never allowed to quit. So now
on anything I do, when I pick it up,

21
00:01:19,441 --> 00:01:23,160
a Sam gonna start it. I got to
finish it. It all don't work.

22
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:28,770
It all linked the best. Mm. It
all ain't knocked out the park.

23
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:32,130
But I walk away saying,
I finished it. I did it.

24
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:38,520
I did it right now I've been boxing or
saw you working on with Rico Verhoeven.

25
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:41,520
I'm fucking, um, first of
all, very strong kicker.

26
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:47,310
He's your man. Huge man.
Okay. He's a fucking beat.

27
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:51,090
He's a good guy too, man. Good
guy. But I started the jeans.

28
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,570
I started it and I said,
why am I doing this?

29
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:58,260
I'm not going to be a
professional fighter. I'm not
trying to be amateur fighter.

30
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:01,670
I'm doing it to get in shape. All right?
Then I start getting shaped and I said,

31
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:05,310
Yo,
so much that I don't know about the sport.

32
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:09,360
I at least want to make sure that I'm
paying homage to the people that do this

33
00:02:09,361 --> 00:02:13,460
for a living. By really understanding
and learning it. You know what,

34
00:02:13,461 --> 00:02:18,150
I'm gonna get real trainer. I'm gonna get
some real people to show me everything.

35
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:22,530
So when it's all said and done and I'm
looked back after my training, I can go,

36
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:27,450
I gave it 100% and look at how good I got.
Look at what I'm a product of.

37
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:31,050
I spar, I go get in the, yeah,

38
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,720
just to feel it so I can say I did it.

39
00:02:33,721 --> 00:02:37,690
You know who else far as Brian Cowen is
this, are you serious? No, that's me.

40
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:40,300
That's me. Come on. That's me, dude.

41
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:43,830
That's me is getting it to look at this.

42
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:49,440
Who is teaching him? His name
is bigs. He's in Atlanta.

43
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:53,760
That's me learning how to turtle
shell within punches. But you know,

44
00:02:53,761 --> 00:02:58,560
he's a former golden glove guy. Really
good to you are in a cup and everything.

45
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:02,770
What I was this bar in session when I'm
Mike real tired. Damn Yada, got in touch.

46
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:05,080
I got my ass whipped in
every couple of times. Um,

47
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:07,810
I go with the guy worried about
that at all getting, cause I'm not,

48
00:03:07,811 --> 00:03:10,530
I don't go crazy.
We head gear and I'm at it,

49
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:13,990
but I'm not in here with guys
that are trying to hurt. Yes,

50
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,670
I'm that I knew you was touching you
guys that have no concept of reality or

51
00:03:18,671 --> 00:03:21,610
control. Like they're, they're
just helping me understand.

52
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:24,380
Here's why you have to keep your hand up.

53
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:28,900
That is a problem with celebrities
trying to spar. Like if you try to like,

54
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:31,630
you know, that's why I'm Mickey work
started getting all that facial surgery.

55
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:34,150
Are you serious? And you
sparring with James Toney. Jeez.

56
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:41,060
When I should just not a
smart move. Right. Criteria.
That's just, it's James. Tony.

57
00:03:41,061 --> 00:03:46,060
He's a mean man. It's just, you can't
like I don't, I don't go in that space.

58
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,680
Have you ever seen James Tony Talk Shit?

59
00:03:47,681 --> 00:03:50,380
Well he spars then some of the most
entertaining thing you'll ever find on

60
00:03:50,381 --> 00:03:55,060
youtube. He's just, he just won't shut the
fuck up all the time. Beating your ass.

61
00:03:55,061 --> 00:03:59,110
He's talking shit, bitch.
That's how Fitch, which got
Bitch, oh this ain't shit.

62
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:04,090
That's, that's hurtful. That's him. He's
one of the best defensive fighters ever.

63
00:04:04,091 --> 00:04:07,240
So he's really difficult to hit.
He's got that shall go on,

64
00:04:07,241 --> 00:04:08,980
stand right in front of
you and you can't hit them.

65
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:11,700
Most frustrating thing in the world.
Yeah. I had a guy who's got a Mikey,

66
00:04:11,701 --> 00:04:16,420
I'm sparring with Mikey.
Mikey hit me with three punches.

67
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,093
I thought,

68
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:23,110
I thought Mikey literally
had like six arms.

69
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,970
This is true story.
I said,

70
00:04:24,971 --> 00:04:29,410
I don't know what just happened but I
thought I had my hands up and no matter

71
00:04:29,411 --> 00:04:31,390
where I put them he just tapped me.

72
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:35,080
He lets me feel it but not to
where I'm like getting knocked out.

73
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:38,260
But I understand now movement,
I understand pivots,

74
00:04:38,261 --> 00:04:41,170
I understand shoulder
protection and that's my goal.

75
00:04:41,171 --> 00:04:43,630
My goal is just to understand
cause I can't do anything halfway.

76
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:46,420
Kevin trying to fight
somebody. Nope. Nope.

77
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:49,910
I just want to say that I did it and I
learned and I can move and I looked apart

78
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:53,620
cause I put time into it.
Well as you learn it too,

79
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,510
and as you watch it and
you start to get trained,

80
00:04:55,511 --> 00:05:00,280
then you start to look at a guy like a
Terrence Crawford or Loma Chenko and you

81
00:05:00,281 --> 00:05:04,650
go, oh, now I appreciate what
you're doing. Because before
you'd see like, Oh yeah,

82
00:05:04,651 --> 00:05:06,790
he beat that guy up. Oh yeah,
he knocked that guy out.

83
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,500
But then you see like how he ducks under
the left and fires back with the right.

84
00:05:11,501 --> 00:05:14,740
You know what I'm saying? Oh Jesus.
This is precision. It's insane.

85
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:17,020
The respect that I have,

86
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:20,290
people that do that or the day
to day is through the roof.

87
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:25,920
The people that fight in the most
amazing shape and the universe.

88
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:31,240
Yeah, you're in the most
amazing shape ever to move,

89
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:35,680
get hit for three to five minutes around,

90
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:39,700
come back, do it, come back to it,

91
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:43,220
and these fights go on and on and on.
I take my hat off to you.

92
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:46,000
You get three rounds out of me.
I'm breathing out my butt.

93
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,240
I don't know where the air is coming from.
I'm searching for it.

94
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,550
It's a crazy way to make a living to me.
Yes,

95
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:54,640
I got it out in your brain
like thank God I don't,

96
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,190
I didn't have to go down that route
and you know, to those that do,

97
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:01,730
just make sure you just put your yet
body first. Like you said, it's a,

98
00:06:01,731 --> 00:06:05,120
it's hurtful when you see the
damage that it can cause. Yeah.

99
00:06:05,121 --> 00:06:06,260
We were talking about that earlier,

100
00:06:06,261 --> 00:06:10,220
like seeing guys as they
start to deteriorate and it's
hard because nobody wants

101
00:06:10,221 --> 00:06:13,100
to tell them that either everybody wants
to tell them that got one more good

102
00:06:13,101 --> 00:06:17,120
fight them and let's uh, maybe at the
end of the year then we'll decide.

103
00:06:17,121 --> 00:06:20,000
But right now we're going to
train hard and it's tough.

104
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,980
It's hard to because there's no options.
They don't,

105
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:25,610
once you've established yourself as a
professional fighter and you don't have an

106
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:29,150
exit strategy, you don't want
to do, you know now at least,

107
00:06:29,151 --> 00:06:33,020
thankfully because of the Internet guys
are getting podcasts and they started

108
00:06:33,021 --> 00:06:37,160
doing commentary shows that talking
about fighting and it's the positive.

109
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:39,200
She just sit there and
just found the positive.

110
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:44,660
The positive within the Internet there
is positive. Oh French. You just don't,

111
00:06:44,661 --> 00:06:47,070
you just don't hear it celebrated as much.
We'll do dinner.

112
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:50,750
It's very positive for me. I mean, this
is this show we do on the Internet.

113
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:53,660
I mean all that.
Not just podcasts,

114
00:06:53,661 --> 00:06:56,570
but youtube videos and also information.

115
00:06:56,571 --> 00:06:59,570
I know more because of the Internet
than I ever would have without it.

116
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:03,260
There's not a, not a doubt in my
mind that though a more educated,

117
00:07:03,261 --> 00:07:07,010
more aware person. I want
you to say Internet. Yeah.

118
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:10,790
The things that you're able to find
and search and I mean, like you said,

119
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,930
you're able to self educate at a,
at a very high level.

120
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,310
These are the goods we're talking about,
the goods.

121
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,540
So when you talk about positive
Kevin, hi, have you been,

122
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:23,870
I always liked that it's this, it's the
things that I look at that are so easy.
