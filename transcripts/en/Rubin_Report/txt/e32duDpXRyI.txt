Speaker 1:          00:01          All right people. We are live on the youtube and the Facebook and I am with a bestselling author, a radio host, and a man who wants beat me senseless in front of millions of people. Larry elder, who I'll come back to the Ruben report to this as well. This will be around three. How are you? This is, so we're at to rocky through C, but if it was rocky, no, no, it's like Muhammad Ali and Frazier Ali. You lost the first one. Frazier. Ali lost the first one. One the second one, and then they had the, had the big third one thrown in the middle of this is Thrilla in Manila? Yes. Thrilla in Manila. See, I wish this was more like rocky because in the original rocky they, it was to a standstill rocky one, right? Nobody wins. Rocky two rocky finally wins. And then three, well that at that point you're retired.

Speaker 1:          00:45          I think Ruben, the only question is which one of us has Ali? Which one? It is this appraiser. We shall find out my friend. All right. So, uh, you just sat down here, but we've already talked about comic books, about basketball and we black panther about racism, about a Trump. Uh, I think we covered everything by. All right, well let's do a little bit of in for the people. So I first, I just want to jump back to that original moment because I said it to you last time you were here, which was about a year ago and when that, that moment where you really beat me senseless about systemic racism, that was about two years ago already, if, if not more at this point. And so many people, I was just in London two days ago and I did a Q and a and people were asking me about it.

Speaker 1:          01:26          I mean that thing really has, there are many versions of it on Youtube. It's just caught fire. And as I said to you last time, it was Sorta, I view it as my best moment as, and my worst. It was my worst because I came to a, an intellectual fight without the proper equipment and it was my best because we left it in. And let it be. And it was a learning moment for me. And then for everyone else, well, you had a lot of class for leading it and a lot of people would've would've taken it out and no one would have known it happened. And secondly, the older one gets, the more difficult it is for one to kind of change one's beliefs. And for you to do it at your age to rethink your assumptions. I takes a lot of, a lot of guts.

Speaker 1:          02:01          A lot of people don't want to do that. And I appreciate pretty depressing thing, don't you think? I agree with you. Most people don't want to do it. I think we've fostered here something that is allowing people to do it, but most people don't want to do that. You know? And it's funny, we're in an atmosphere where just a moment ago, I'm driving in listening to talk radio and I think it's CNN or MSNBC and they're going on and on about how Trump has now made lying, uh, the currency of the day. And no one tells the truth anymore. Facts don't matter. And they're talking about the kinds of lying that Trump does, where he talks about the crowd size and how much money he has and stuff like that. The lies of the left are huge lines and the damage the country, the lie that racism remains a major problem in America.

Speaker 1:          02:41          It's a lie, the lie that women make 77 cents on the dollar for doing the same thing that men do it, it's a lie, the lie that rich get richer, the poor get poorer. These are lies and these are big lies that drive the left and drive votes. These are the kinds of things that matter. So when you sit across from a guy like me, and the first time we did it when I really still felt I was part of the, I was trying to reform the left. Realistically, I'm not part of the left anymore, you know, and again, the left right thing is we talk about all the time doesn't even have that much meaning anymore. It's really about Authoritarians, Libertarians and all that. Um, but for all the years that you've been doing, staking out conservative positions for how many years publicly and want to drive 25 years, was there a more sensible left at the time?

Speaker 1:          03:20          Was there a guy you could sit across from that you disagreed with intellectually, but felt that it was, it was forthright, it was honest. You just disagreed with the methodology and the results. Sure. There were lots of people that I felt that way with. And William Buckley had a very good friend, uh, uh, John Kenneth Galbraith who was a left wing economist. They disagreed about everything. They were good friends. I believe it or not, Antonin Scalia, his best friend on the Supreme Court, Ruth Bader Ginsburg. What it requires, if somebody to recognize that if I have a position that's different from yours, it doesn't mean that I'm a bad guy. It doesn't mean that I'm evil. It means that I see the world differently. It takes a certain kind of maturity to do that. Unfortunately, we've gotten to the place now where if you don't believe that racism is a major problem in America, uh, if you're black, you're a sellout.

Speaker 1:          04:03          If you're white, you're a racist. If you say something negative about the Black Panther, which I just did, I got hammered, got some guy told me that, well, it's because as a black person and a black director and a black hero and therefore you don't like it. I mean, the, the star is guy named Chadwick Bozeman. And I was fortunate enough to be invited to see the premiere of 42. He was brilliant. I saw the movie three or four times. I like him so much. I saw him in, um, uh, a movie about Thurgood Marshall, which was a very good movie, probably not commercially, uh, uh, successful, but it was a very good movie. And I saw him play in the movie with the, we play James Brown. He was very good. The movie wasn't that good, but he was good. Yeah. So he's an intriguing actor. Again, I don't go to see a movie to, to not be happy to waste my time.

Speaker 1:          04:45          Yeah. And you're a comic book guy. I mean we were talking about comic books is, cause I've got a whole bunch in the green room here and you were immediately going on. I've got all this stuff you love. So it's not like you're walking into that thing to hate it. Right. And so the criticism is just bizarre. I mean, what do you think I am? What do you think I do? I get from the morning hate myself, Dow to my eyeballs out quite a claw, my skin color off. I mean that's just, and, and, and, and they, I feel sorry for people like that. People have often asked me, does it make you mad? It doesn't. I feel sorry for you. If you are so trained, so indoctrinated to be that's rabid against somebody who just has a different point of view. There's a problem with you, not with me, you know?

Speaker 1:          05:20          Well on that note, I owe you a public thanks. Not just because you beat me senseless and helped me get here. But also because everyone knows about the interview I did with Thomas Soul and we had been working on it for about three years. You sent him a note, I don't know if that was what pushed him over the edge, but I think it was one of the really, one of the big things that I've been able to do here to bring some of those ideas back. And that's what you've been doing for a long time. He's like, he's like JD Salinger. It's hard. It's hard. It's hard. It's hard to get him. We have to get 'em out once you get him. He's, he's amazing. Yeah. And I met him because I was on cspan at the time. I had a four hour live radio show and cspan broadcast of the entire show and I get a letter from Thomas Soul.

Speaker 1:          05:59          It was like getting a letter from Elvis and it said, um, my wife and I watched your entire show. Your, you were great. Uh, you, you, uh, you laid out all the arguments, very well done. And I wrote him back and we got together several times since then. We've become very good friends. Yeah. So I sense a massive shift happening in politics right now. And clearly the center of it right at the moment is with the black community. I don't even like using phrases like that because I don't like that collective thing. But sometimes you gotta you gotta talk about things in a way that allow most people to understand them. So, uh, you know, what is it about two and a half weeks ago or so? Kanye west seven words. I love the way Candace Owens thinks. Wow. Yeah. Now do you think that is as big of a game?

Speaker 1:          06:41          Yeah, I think it is a game changer. Yeah. Um, in the sense that Kanye West has 28 million Twitter followers, I don't know how many Instagram, I don't know how many Facebook would you add them all together? It's a boatload of people. He has more influence on the way black people think. Uh, then Clarence Thomas, uh, Thomas Soul, Walter Williams, Larry elder put together unfortunately. Uh, and for him to say that and to begin the process of making it okay for black people to rethink their assumption, they can okay to say, I'm not a democrat. That's a huge thing. 95% of black voters voted for Obama. Uh, Trump did a little bit better, but not a whole lot better. If the Democrats lose 10, 15, 20% of that black vote, they are toast at the national level, which is why people like me have to be vilified. People like Candace Collins are, are now direct threats to the domination of the Democratic Party.

Speaker 1:          07:38          People like Kanye West, they've got to be put down. They've got to be demeaned. You can't just say he's got a different point of view. You've got to say something that's fundamentally, fundamentally wrong with them. Otherwise, how are you get 95% of people to vote and see the world one way? And you have to show them, prove to them, uh, convinced them that they, that these guys are against you, that, uh, that you're evicted crat and these are victimizers. And that's what the left has done so successfully. And so when you saw the reaction to him, now again, I, we briefly discussed this, but I don't think either one of us know what his political beliefs are. Reviewed. Even if he has, he knows what they are, but just, just not to a hate republicans. Not to hate Trump for that is a big deal. Thank you know, we're, we're in Hollywood.

Speaker 1:          08:17          You and I are, is there an a list our doing it here. I have no, is there an alias actor or an alias actress in his or her twenties or thirties who've come out and said, I love Trump. None. Nobody. You get some older ones. Maybe they've already established, you've said a few things, but is there somebody right now who's hot, uh, on the brink of stardom or just just in stardom, who's come out in favor of Trump? No, Trump just say basic conservative. Yeah, because it would be damaging to their career. It's not possible to 100% of them think the same way. I don't think so. There's gotta be a few, but when they come out and say something, of course not. [inaudible] how'd you get to walk of fame? A star? [inaudible] you pay off for that. Then when someone asked me that report is that, how did that happen?

Speaker 1:          08:56          I said, well this is what happens when you make a substantial donation to the Clinton Foundation. Um, I have no idea. I know that I'm nominated all the time because I would get some sort of inquiry from people telling me that you've been nominated and nothing ever happened. So I didn't think anything would happen. Low and behold, who know? Yeah. When you think of the odd levels of racism in this town, like just the way they do things, like just a couple of weeks ago when they boot Cosby out of the, uh, whatever it is, the television and Kevin Arts along along that, so then they do Roman plants in the same day, but it was so obvious that it was like, oh, we got to take care of Cosby now, but we don't want to make it seem like we're just booting the black guy. So where is the white guy we can get rid of?

Speaker 1:          09:33          And you know, I don't think anything to do with black or white. I think they realize the hypocrisy. I think they realized if we're, if we're kicking out bill costs because of allegations of rape and here's a guy who pled guilty to rape a teenager. Yeah. And we're celebrating him. We have a problem here. So costly caused them to have to be consistent. If nothing to do with, with plants. He's race or Carthy is race. He had to deal with, with the, with the bizarre concept of somebody being booted out because he was accused of rape and somebody who was charged with it and pled guilty to it. He's okay. I think in their own warped worldview though, if Cosby had been white and they felt they had to get rid of him, they wouldn't have felt that they needed to get rid of another white guy made.

Speaker 1:          10:16          Maybe I get it. I believe it's possible, but they've caused us to think this way. Right. That's what I'm saying. I'm just trying to get in their minds. I'm not trying to get in and get in our minds. Um, but okay. I want to get back to what you just said about the reaction to Kanye because the reaction to me, it seemed, it wasn't just that people were like, he's wrong cause he likes Trump because you know, lists for things that are sensible. It was, you know, Candice is far right. Kanye is on opioids. 10 other smear pieces on both of them, et Cetera, et cetera. And I think you're probably very aware of why that is. And you kind of hinted at it, but can you explain why it's always so overboard? Well, again, anybody who threatens their 95% monolithic black vote, uh, is an enemy.

Speaker 1:          11:00          Uh, they've gotta be dealt with. They've got to be put down. And black people have been indoctrinated to believe that racism is this massive, massive problem in the world, when in fact it isn't a massive, massive problem in America, when in fact it isn't. Yeah, I was on CNN the last time I was on the sh the dot lemon show. I reminded them of a 1997 pole that CNM and Time magazine did wear black teenagers and white teenagers were asked, is, is racism major problem in America? I think you and I might've talked about this. Yeah. And more, more um, white teams and black teams said racing. It was a major problem in America. And then when the poll ask, is racism a big problem, a small problem or no problem, and your own daily lives, 90% of the black teens set a small problem or no problem.

Speaker 1:          11:39          In my own daily lives. That was in 1997. Now, that was before Obama and before Obama got reelected. You're telling me now things are worse now than they were back then. Yet our so called black leadership, people like Keith Ellison, people like Louis Farrakhan, people like Jesse Jackson, people like Sharpton, the, the, uh, the, the, the, the neighbors over on MSNBC and CNN. If you contracted on those guys, you'd be afraid to leave your house if you were black. So what do you think is actually going on in the minds of these guys? I know you're not a mind reader, but like is it, is it truly bad intentions or is it moral confusion, political confused hard. It's hard. It's hard to say. I think some of it is cynical. Some of it is, uh, is bs. Uh, recently for example, I just saw that a chapter had of an in and AACP chapter in South Carolina wrote a big Facebook post about being pulled over and the officer asked him about drugs and asking him about, um, uh, why are you having such a fancy car?

Speaker 1:          12:35          And he wanted a big pace Facebook posts about it. Unfortunately, the officer recorded everything and it turned out everything the Guy Dad was alive. This is the chapter head of the Naacp in that town in South Carolina. Now if racism so bad that you have to make up stuff, man, man, that shows you the, the, the call that victim hood has right now for whatever. Remember the young lady, the actors from the movie Django here in Santa Monica. Uh, and she was, um, apparently having sex with her boyfriend in her car. Somebody called nine one one and she choose the officer's of, of, of a, of asking all sorts of things about her, uh, about her race. And she didn't realize she had been recorded. Turns out she with wrong. And uh, a judge made her write a letter of apology. I mean really it, so what do you do?

Speaker 1:          13:23          What do you do? I was at University of New Hampshire two weeks ago and they were a bunch of protesters there. Black lives matter, sent a bunch of people. And I kept saying that I'm for everyone having, you know, equal respect under the law and you can't say all lives matter. That's races. Racist even said black lives matter. Cause I was, I did everything I could to make it clear that I want us all to be treated equally with dignity, with, I mean you, but you know what it's like when you get some of these protesters, the ones that are not, not a, not an average protester who may want to listen a little bit and then, and then ask a question, right? When you get the ones that are just there to, to borate and scream and the rest. So one of the, one of the protesters are, there were a couple at one point who were saying, uh, you know, somebody like we could be shot when we get out of here, all this hate speech, all of this stuff.

Speaker 1:          14:04          And I realized, even though I kept saying what I believe to be true and what I believe to be right, there was almost nothing I could do. Right. So what do you do for those people? Because I think the masses are shifting a little bit, but what do you do for that? You're not going to win every argument. You really can't. And if somebody is invested with the idea that the man is holding me back, that officers pulled me over because of my race. There's not a whole lot you can do about it. You can point to studies. I mean, it's been studied. They're not big on studies. And under Obama in 20 2013, I think it was the uh, national institutes of justice, which is the research arm of the DOJ, did a study on it called race and traffic stops. Turned out 75% of the black motorist who were stopped, said, I got stopped for legitimate reasons.

Speaker 1:          14:46          It turned out that you named a traffic offense. Speeding, driving went out, uh, uh, your, your lights on driving without a seatbelt on, uh, driving without proper registration. You name the offense, a black motorist with work with more likely to come to commit it. And the Nij report said, yes, blacks are stopped more often than whites are with the reasons have to do with differences in offending. End of quote came out under Obama quietly, nobody talked about it. How much of this then is just a failure of what the Republicans have done? I get you on all of the things that the Democrats and the left had sold that are lies. I get the way they, they manipulate all these different minority communities, but it seems to me because there is a resurgence now, right? Like the first thing I said to Thomas Soul are, yeah, are you excited that you know you're having this resurgence?

Speaker 1:          15:30          He kind of looked at me like, well, you know, I've been doing this for 50 years. Can sort of, or that people now share the clip of us endlessly and Candice and Connie and all of this. Um, it, this does seem to become a Mac, but some of this has to be on the Republicans too, right? That, that it got so bad. Well, yeah, I mean the Republicans have done a bad job in um, and marketing their brand. And most people don't even know that, uh, the Democrats oppose the 13th, 14th, 15th Amendment sometimes. Unanimously. Most people don't know that as a percentage of the party, more Republicans voted for the passage of the Civil Rights Act and the Senate and in the house then did Democrats. And there's this myth that, um, uh, what happened is it was this big switch in the 60s when all the racists, uh, uh, from the south left the Democratic Party and joined a public and party when in fact, if you look at all of the Democrats who voted against the civil rights act in the house, and the Democrats have all of them only to switched parties, it became Republicans.

Speaker 1:          16:20          Um, the first, uh, Republican senator from Tennessee since reconstruction was a guy named Howard Baker, who was a guy who was in favor of integration. So it's, it's a big lie and Republicans have done a poor job, uh, in and telling the truth. The other thing is Republicans, uh, are gentle when they're called racists. They often just don't say anything or ignore it and hope the moment goes away. Recently, Mike Kelly from Pennsylvania, a Republican member of the house, squared off with Maxine waters. It was his bogus report that purported to show that a auto dealers, uh, Jack over black people by charging them more interest rates to get loans, when in fact, all of these things are done by algorithms. There's no nothing to do with race at all. And my Kelly happened to be in the car business. Well, he knew it wasn't true and he challenged her and he said something to the effect of we Republicans have an obligation to when we are confronted with nonsense to call it and we just need, we need to start calling it.

Speaker 1:          17:18          And that's the problem. People often say to me, Larry, you can say stuff we can't say. Yeah, really you are incapable of, of articulating the words. I just, your brain cannot put out the conversation. I just did. Yeah. And that's the problem when white people are called racist, um, why don't you defend yourself? Um, you know who you are. You know how you feel, you know what you've done, you know what your thoughts are and someone calls you racist and you'd let it go. I mean, it's a problem. Yeah. Are you feeling this glow right now? I mean, you must be feeling pretty good about this. Like something has shifted here. It's gotta. It's gotta feel good. Right, right. I can, I can sense that. Well, you saw a poll and it showed a, you know, I'm big on facts not on feeling. I'll be right back.

Speaker 1:          17:59          So I was letting you have a feeling you, the polls show that the support for Trump doubled among black men. Incredible rates from 11 to 22% and less than a week and about a week and it shows you there was a dyke and once the dyke broke, it broke. And the support for blacks in general has increased, uh, about 50%, uh, uh, for Trump over the last few weeks. All it because Kanye West's Candice Owen have made it okay for people all around the country. They have conversations like you and I are having right now and these kinds of conversations are taking place and Blakley who were saying, wait a second, Donald Trump wants to build a wall and do something about illegal immigration in part because studies have shown there's a economist named George Boerhaaves, he'd probably done more work on the impact of illegal immigration. Any other economists, there's no question. He writes that illegal immigration, unskilled especially, um, post is competition for jobs for people.

Speaker 1:          18:54          In the inner city and puts downward pressure on their wages to Donald Trump wants to, wants to do something about that. And studies have shown that when parents have vouchers, the results are better. The kids graduate at a higher rate, their test scores are better. And the parental satisfaction is through the roof. And Donald Trump wants to provide inner city parents with vouchers and the polls show that inner city parents want them. And the Teacher's Union, which is right in the pocket of the Democratic Party and vice versa, does not want you to have those. But Donald Trump is a bigot. So people all around the country having this conversation and the economy has done well. And under Obama, the black labor force participation rate, the percentage of black men looking for jobs or working a hadn't been that low since they were keeping stats. And under Donald Trump, black unemployment isn't at all time low in part because he's lower taxes and stopped turning back.

Speaker 1:          19:43          Some of these stupid regulations that strangle businesses, uh, and when business doesn't do well, the people that suffer the most are the people at the bottom. The ones that need a job and don't have a job and Donald Trump is doing something about that. But he's a racist. Well that's kind of a difficult argument to make. His daughter was a converted Jew. One member of his cabinet is the formerly respected Ben Carson, but Donald Trump's a bigot. Don't forget our are openly gay. Uh, now ambassador to Germany, right at Grinnell, right. And a series of, and don't forget all the mini Haley and all and all the material you see of Donald Trump hanging out with Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton back in the day when, uh, when they thought that he could benefit them and now all of a sudden he's a bigger, it's outrageous. And that conversation is being taken place all over the country.

Speaker 1:          20:24          Also, rappers, as you well know, used to rap about Trump all the time. No one syllable word, his word word is named Ryan did a lot of stuff. So they used it and they often talked about aspiring to be like Trump. Then he ran for president. He became an sob. How did that happen? Do you think? He was just the guy that was the only guy that could have done it, basically. I think so Hilary was the best funded, uh, best back candidate ever seen. Um, and it took somebody to take on the media and to cut through CNN and MSNBC through social media. Also, Trump snuck up on people. The media is really angry at themselves for letting it happen. I read that he got about $2 billion in free advertising now. A lot of it was bad. Yeah. But the numbers went up whenever they, whenever they showed him the numbers went up and, and as began knocking off people and knocking all people, they realized that he was being taken seriously and then it was too late.

Speaker 1:          21:16          Yeah. You know, it's interesting you mentioned that, that poll, that 11 to 22% amongst black male pole, that thing came out. I quickly saw it on Twitter and then I kind of looked around. I was like, wait a minute. This seems massive. Like why we shouldn't understate this. Right. A doubling of support right now. If at any point it had doubled under Obama, although it was, you're saying it was high enough to the point that it probably, it couldn't have doubled but under right. Any other situation with any other minority, the media would have been going on bananas and it wasn't, I think as I recall, respected poll to wasn't Reuters. Uh, I'm not totally sure, but by every estimation he was a legit legit pole. Yeah. Yeah. So that just shows you where the media is at with this. They can't talk about it to talk about it also then Lynn's energy to it and when courage more and more people to rethink their assumptions.

Speaker 1:          22:00          So let's just ignore it. Yeah. I once asked Thomas Soul, when you write a column like this, I forget what column it was. There was some column I think challenge challenging the assumption of race based preferences. And he challenged some big study and I said, when you write something like this and you effectively refute some study, what happens? He said, usually nothing. He said they went and they move on to something else. Yeah, man, there's the long game here. It's a long, long game for sure. Um, so when I've had you on one of the push backs that I get after, people always say, well, all right, well I'll grant him a little stuff. Like if they're willing to give you a little something, they'll go, all right, he made me write, we don't have laws that are against black people. So it's not systemic if that's what you're defining systemic as.

Speaker 1:          22:46          And people seem to have a couple different definitions of systemic, but they'll, they'll talk about the history of inequality and why that needs to be compensated for now. Now I suspect you might say, well, most of those policies that have created that inequality or because of the Democrats, but that's the last word I'm going to put in your mouth. Well, how do you acknowledge that argument? Well, all a state can be, it's just in its own time. Um, my father wasn't a slave. Um, my father never met his father, but uh, I'm sure he wasn't a slave either. And so the people right now on the face of the earth have had nothing to do with historical injustices to black people. Uh, and you could take a wand and wave it over America and remove every Smidgen of racism from the hearts of White America.

Speaker 1:          23:31          How will that solve the social problem with that are really facing the black community? Primarily the large number of black kids, they were raised without fathers in the home. 73% right now, 73% right now, black kids are raised without fathers. 25% of inner city black kids have a criminal record, either arrested in jail, on parole, or on probation. 50% of the inner city kids are dropping out of high school. And those that do graduate often cannot read, write, and compute at grade level. What does any of that had to do with racism? And many of these cities, uh, and school boards have been run by Democrats and run by black people for decades. So, okay. So if we remove the racism part of it, but acknowledge those numbers, your answer would be that we have to, what then changed the education system? I mean for me it's the, you got to start.

Speaker 1:          24:14          It all starts in the home recently. Uh, I was pleased to watch Denzel Washington being interviewed about his movie. Uh, Roman j Israel. Yeah. Which was about a criminal defense lawyer and someone put a mic in his face, uh, and ask Denzel Washington, what about the large number of, of blacks who were being warehoused by the criminal justice system. And I just knew he was going to say something about, yeah, we need to do something about the systemic racism, blah, blah, blah. He didn't, he said, it all starts in the home. I saw it in my generation and every generation thereafter. Uh, if you're raised by the streets, uh, then the streets become your father and the course become your home and the GL becomes your, your residence as what he said. Something to that effect. And it was spot on. I didn't expect it.

Speaker 1:          24:57          Uh, and again, I think things like that when you add them all up will cause people to start rethinking their assumptions. Yeah. Are you feeling it like when you're doing your radio show on you're taking calls now or it's hard. It's hard to say because you know, this is a, I'm often preaching to the crowd. Yeah. Um, I like to think that the reason my numbers are so big is that I'm getting people that don't normally listen to a conservative slash libertarian, a talk show host. But it's hard to say because the people call in are motivated, they're driven to call in. They don't necessarily represent the, uh, the entire, um, population base. So it's hard to say. Plus you t you choose calls because they're entertaining because the person has a good point of view, has a good speaking voice. Uh, it gets to the point quickly.

Speaker 1:          25:38          So there are all sorts of factors that go into it. So it's not scientific. Yeah, I like that you just describe yourself as a conservative slash libertarian cause I think on the, on the libertarian side of stuff, I think we're, we're pretty much, yeah, as close to lock step as you can get. What do you see as the differences between those two positions? Does it even matter to you? Well, the reason I use that is because people often call me a conservative. I don't consider myself that I consider myself to be a libertarian, a smaller libertarian who they're registered Republican. I don't run from the term conservative. Um, and most of my views are conservative, but I, but I'm more libertarian than conservative even mean to you anymore. What is like the phrase [inaudible] when I think of a conservative, think of a fiscal conservative and a social conservative. Uh, and on things like same sex marriage, things like a doctor assisted suicide, things like, uh, like drugs. I believe all those things should be done on a state by state basis. I'm a federalist though, that way a lot of conservatives are perfectly okay with, in my opinion, passing laws that would, uh, banned certain behavior that they don't like. And, and I'm, I'm not, uh, I'm not, uh, in that camp.

Speaker 2:          26:38          Okay.

Speaker 1:          26:38          I guess also conservatives

Speaker 2:          26:43          probably,

Speaker 1:          26:44          I remember listening to Ann Coulter, Ann Coulter was talking about how she posed the, um, the idea of legalizing drugs and talked about the cost to society for that. Well, a libertarian wouldn't think that way at all. That you just accept that. What price to pay for freedom, basically. Freedom is, is a, is expensive. Uh, it's, it's, it's, it's a value in and of itself. And when you talk about the cost of this, the cost of that, what about the cost of freedom? What about the value of freedom? The value, the value of being able to do what you want, provided you're not hurting somebody else. So when you said something to the effect of that were all men of our own time, do you think all you can be, it's just in your, oh, you can be adjusted, Justin, that's even better. So when you said that if we were to look back when we had federal laws and that were, that actually were racist and Jim Crow laws and things like that, and then we had the civil rights act of 1963 or 64, I always forget 64.

Speaker 1:          27:37          Um, now that stopped it at the federal level. Would you have been okay if the states had dealt with that? Because I get that one a lot now because people will say rytary and they made the argument again, it's probably the biggest question and the biggest argument that people have against Libertarians. Yeah. Um, uh, Barry Goldwater voted against the civil rights act of 1964. He became the standard bearer for the Republican Party and 64, uh, he later on said he regretted his vote against the bill. But at the time he said, I'm voting against the bill because of libertarian reasons. He wasn't a racist. He didn't believe the government should tell you if you're operating a store, whether or not somebody could come in and come out. Um, and whether or not you are, should be forced to serve somebody. And he is not wrong. I know that freaks a lot of black people out.

Speaker 1:          28:25          Uh, but think about it. Uh, the country changed rapidly and laws can't make you change. We change and therefore the laws changed because we changed. Uh, America changed. Um, and bigotry, there's zero tolerance for anti black. White bigotry is zero tolerance for it in America. My goodness. Anybody who's out in as a bigot gets hammered. Look what happened to Donald Sterling. He lost his team for crying out loud. So if some guy somewhere decided he wanted to open up a bar and no black people come and sign this as only whites, he would be socially maligned. Friends who go there have friends who go there, uh, would malign the person. When I lived in Cleveland in the 70s, there was an area called little Italy and I was told if you go to little Italy, you're black, they will spit in your food. They don't want you there.

Speaker 1:          29:19          Everybody, everybody I know told me that. So nobody I know went there. Anybody I know who did go there, if they told anybody they will socially, uh, scoring. And then the 14 years I would living in Cleveland elite got smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller. So racism is not financially beneficial. Um, the reason branch Rickey hire Jackie Robinson with not to be a civil rights pioneer, he wanted to beat the Damn Yankees and he wanted to fast shortstop, uh, a first baseman who could do it. Uh, and once other teams realize that these guys were good, they had to get them to, yeah. So although I can tell you wouldn't be for reversing the civil rights act, you could make an argument in a modern sense for that all of these things should just be kicked to the states. Right? Right. Correct. Yeah. I'm there on that too, which I think people are always attacking libertarians for in, regarding federal institutions like schools and things like that, that, that, that our, that our government, uh, of course, uh, the 14th amendment applies.

Speaker 1:          30:16          But can you explain why? Because again, this is where I think people just get lost. Well, the 14th amendment says no state, uh, Shell, uh, deny anybody equal protection. So it's gotta be a state actor, uh, a, uh, a college or university that state, but a private university should be able to do what they want even though none of them can because everybody accepts federal dollars. And therefore the government can tell you what to do. There is one university, Hillsdale and a few others that don't take any, any federal money and therefore they can admit who they want by whatever criteria they want. And that ought to be what, uh, what should happen in any institution in the private sector, whether it's a, a grocery store or, or, or college or university. What do you make of just the line of thinking that we would ever be able to set a series of laws in place that would perfect the whole damn thing because that's really what this comes down to.

Speaker 1:          31:03          They, they think basically we can just, we can basically Riedel away your ability to think really, right. And then you'll all act like sort of automatons and behave and no one will be racist and whatever. But at the same time, and we know this because of silicon valley right now, no one will be able to come up with the ingenuity of thought. No one will have an original premise or ability to do anything cool anymore. Right. Um, well that's a problem with the left. That's why their moral busy body. So right now, and I think a Seattle, they just passed a law that's going to tax businesses so that, so that uh, they can build more, more shelter for homeless people. The more you encourage this kind of behavior. It was just there in Seattle last week. A lot of homeless people that are going to get, yeah.

Speaker 1:          31:40          Have you been downtown La recently? Yeah, up in Seattle, up in, up in San Francisco. Uh, these are all places that are all left wing and they're very generous and they all feel sorry for the homeless and therefore they're making it easier, easier, easier for homeless people all over the country to move there and making it easier and easier for you to be a little less responsible because you know, you're going to get a house. There's somebody who's going to pay for, yeah. So as a guy that you were born in La, right? So you were born and raised in La. First of all, why are we going? Why, why, why haven't you? You want to do a little thing on it and you, it's a, um, first off, I don't know where I'm going to go with that. I have to interrupt you or not.

Speaker 1:          32:13          You don't have to. You interrupted by flow. So, um, first all, why haven't you run against Maxine waters already? I mean, what are you doing for God sakes? Let me support you. Please. I would lose, I supported a guy named Ross mowing against her a few years ago and I've, this is the only time I ever really went out and campaign for somebody else. I mean, I made speeches for him, a donut, gave money to him, had him on my radio show a bunch of times, a Vietnam vet, great guy, white guy. And he lost, I want to say 84% to 16%. I mean, it was just a smashing. Um, she, she has that district in her hands. And, um, I mean she strikes me as actually dangerous to democracy at a certain level. When she keeps going up, we're going to, we're going to find the reason to impeach him.

Speaker 1:          33:00          She had who the president is for sure what he thinks she is dangerous, but they will tell you who I think the more dangerous people like Eric Holder because Eric Holder is taken seriously by the left. Maxine waters, the caricature, they have her for the reasons I mentioned earlier, to keep life people angry, to stoke up the anger, but no one takes us seriously when Eric Holder comes out and says, um, that the fact that black boys are disproportionally expelled from their schools compare to their population percentage when he calls that pernicious racism, when in fact it's because of their bad behavior that's taken seriously. When Eric Holder says that the reason blacks get longer sentences, uh, compared to white criminal, definitive committed the same crime, uh, when the US sentencing commission says the reason is because judge has taken to consideration arrest records at the end of the sentencing process.

Speaker 1:          33:45          And the black criminal defendant unfortunately has a bigger restaurant arrest record than the average white guy, uh, who gets arrested for the same crime. Uh, and Eric Holder in a speech referred to that disparity as pernicious racism, even though the sentencing commission said what I just now said. Um, Eric Holder says that the push for voter id, which the majority of blacks want, uh, is pernicious racism. This guy is taken seriously. That's the one that really bothers me, that when they imply that somehow black people can't get an id, I mean, you have to have an idea to drive a car, right? You have to have an id to go into a bar, some assault, some of, some of the events that Maxine waters puts on. You have to have an ID to get into. Yeah, I'm sure. I'm sure most of the Muni, but really that like, do they not realize that that actual racism was condescending to is just, it's, you know, yeah.

Speaker 1:          34:32          Do you remember, I think we discussed this once, but I'd love to just dive back into it for a second. Like a moment in your formative years, your younger years when you finally were just like, this is what it is and I'm just, I'm just going to say what it is. I can't think of a time like that. I, I know that had been many times where I've said things and we've gotten, gotten a hell for it. I remember being in college, we read Daniel Patrick Moynihan report that I mentioned that to you called a Negro family. That's national action, a classical liberal, by the way, Daniel Patrick and I got hammered by the whites of my class for being, uh, uh, uh, pro, uh, patriarchal. I think half of the term that was used. And I'm in the raising the inner city and I saw a problem and I thought that Daniel Patrick Patrick Moynihan was a, was a canary in the coal mine and talked about this problem.

Speaker 1:          35:18          So I said, so, and I got hammered. Yeah. But I don't remember any particular moment. I've always just been confident about who I am and what I am. And, um, my parents always told me that I could be whatever I want it to be and my dad was a republican and so I watched all my dad walk into a voting booth. This is during the primary season in, in my neighborhood and because there's nothing but Democrats there, there must have been about 10 or 12 little booths where you stand in for the Democrat one for Republicans for that where guy that came there and it's my dad, he's the only Republican in my whole neighborhood. And he would come up there and every everybody courses see he's Republican because he'd walk up there, you didn't care. And he knew that a lot of blacks felt republicans were bad people and evil people.

Speaker 1:          35:57          He didn't care. My father couldn't have cared less. And um, yeah, it's just this, this thing around race it, it's gross. I hate the fact that I even where we have you on that we ended up talking about this. It is girls, especially when you, when you consider America is the least racist white majority society in the country, the only one that's ever elected a black president and reelected one. Um, Orlando Patterson, the, um, he's a left wing or a sociologist at Harvard said America has more opportunities for blacks and any other country in the entire world, including all of those in Africa. Yeah. Best Fared, best educated. Um, you know, and here we are bitching and moaning and whining about what happened. Uh, uh, during slavery and Jim Crow. I mean, honestly, in order to, to be successful, this was a, this was a, um, an aid to Bill Clinton.

Speaker 1:          36:41          He said, you need to do, do three things to escape poverty. Graduate from high school. Don't have a kid before you're 20 and get married before you have a kid. If you follow that formula, only seven or 8% of people are poor. However, if you don't follow that formula, the majority of people are going to be poor. That's it. Now, what does it have to do with racism? Would have to do with David Duke explaining that to me. Yeah. Let, let's talk about that part of it though. So the, the, the David Duke's, it's so silly to even have to bring him up or, or just whatever the, whatever the truly racist part of the rite is. And I do believe it does exist there. There are racist, there are actual races. There are, you know, some of this, some of the all right crew, whatever that [inaudible] on the and left.

Speaker 1:          37:18          Absolutely. I just want to give it to the devil, his due I on the right for a moment. However, however, uh, uh, David Duke doesn't have a TV show every Sunday on MSNBC. The way I'll show up into us, I'll sharpen falsely accused a white man of raping to want Brawley referred to mayor, uh, uh, David Dinkens a first and only black mayor of New York as an inward whore. Uh, he was right in the thick of the crown heights riot, which was the most serious program in the history of the of America. He's on tape urging Jews, depend their yama clothes and come over my house and let's get it on. He's on a surveillance tape with the FBI. I discussing doing a cocaine deal. He owes $5 million in taxes. He's got a TV show on MSNBC every Sunday interviewing a list. Important people, Scotty beam me up.

Speaker 1:          38:01          And so when I hear all this stuff about the, the, the racism on, on, on the right, and this guy has a show, I mean, it's outrageous. And Don Lemon recently referred to Brock a to the Donald Trump quote as a racist. Nothing happened. Glenn Beck, who's not a news guy, he's a commentator called Barack Obama, a racist and a, uh, group called color of change, which is a, a major Searles backed left wing organization, put a petition. The targeting has advertisers. Nobody had a problem with Don Lemon calling Trump a racist, but calling Obama Racist, oh my goodness. Bring out the pitchforks is the problem there that you don't want your side in this case to start using the same tactics. So it's almost, it becomes like an uneven battlefield, right? So like, um, what's her name on Fox? Laura Ingram says the thing about, uh, David Hogg was it right? And then, and then she gets boycotted and Fox definitely, at least for a couple of days, was considering firing her.

Speaker 1:          38:55          Him, I'm told I'm pretty good account. Wow. Uh, yeah. And, or at least, you know, there was going to be some sort of longer suspension or something and uh, that the right doesn't do that. The right just, if somebody on the left says, I ain't crazy or, or just let's use the case of the guy you're talking about, so I'll sharpen, he's on Msnbc and it's just like, yeah. All right. Nobody's watching this nonsense. Let, well, the double standards, we just, it's, it's just, uh, it's in the cake. A recent example of that, um, is this staffer, apparently a low level staffer in the White House, which was discussing the fact that John Mccain apparently going to vote against, Gina has mold the nominee for the, for the CIA. And the staffers said something to the effect of, that's okay, he's dying anyway. Close quote. How that got out is beyond me, but it gets out, her name gets out.

Speaker 1:          39:42          Uh, and now Donald Trump is being attacked because he hasn't apologized to John Mccain and John Mccain family for, with this low level staffer says when Obama was in office, I think was 2014 a quotes senior Obama official close quote was how the hill described it, referred to Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister of Israel as chicken bleep, except it wasn't bleep. Yeah. And also called him a coward. Nobody, nobody pressured the Obama, no apologizing. And Obama didn't apologize, John Kerry did, uh, to, to, uh, not in Yahoo, but uh, but Trump won. But the Obama was not pressured into, into saying this. Now what's worse, calling one of our closest allies, chicken bleep or some low level staff referring to a senator because of his vote and it doesn't matter. He's going to, he's dying anyway, which is worse. And which one caused, no, the more controversy, the one about Mccain did, the one about, uh, Obama tree fell in the forest, didn't make a sound.

Speaker 1:          40:35          So with all the understandable, the stain that you have for the mainstream media, and I, and I'm with you on all of that. And, and you know, the things that I see people say about you or just this group of people that I know to be decent human beings. Are you at all concerned that if the mainstream media completely collapses, which I would argue either has already happened or is an inevitability, at least at this point, that what we're going to be left with is such a siloing of opinion that we are going to be completely unable to have any sort of national conversation. May look, maybe that gets everything back to a local level, which I would be okay with. But are you concerned with that at all? I'm, I'm not. Um, I'm not one of those who thinks things are worse now than they've ever been.

Speaker 1:          41:15          I mean, this is a country where we've, we fought over a big issues for a long time. Uh, the revolutionary war of course. Uh, and then of course we had the war of 1812. We had the civil war, World War One, World War II, Vietnam, Korean War, w nine 11. Uh, people hated Ronald Reagan. I thought he was a, uh, George Bush. Uh, uh, what was it? Bush lied. People died. Uh, there's tension in this country. There always has been a for a very long period of time. We get along better now than ever before. We've, I said, man, I, I don't think you can understate the fact that we elected and reelected the black president. Uh, in the 50s. The polls show that the percentage of white Americans who would be willing to vote for a black person, no matter how well to call it for qualified, was in the single digits.

Speaker 1:          42:00          And now I think only three or 4% of Republicans and Democrats say that under no circumstances would they vote for a black person, for president. In fact, the greater prejudice against the Mormon, uh, and it gets worn for a woman than it is voting for a black person now. So, uh, America is a very different place than it used to be. And for the left to act like it's not insults the men and women who worked hard to get us to where we are right now. Yeah. Well, just that lack of acknowledgement of how things have moved forward. When I did this University of New Hampshire thing last week, I said at the beginning of the speech, I said, everyone in this room, I would say, I would guess this without exception, that everyone in this room has it better than their grandparents had it. And I didn't see anyone nodding.

Speaker 1:          42:39          Nobody, nobody said no, there's, they're still yelling at me after about all of this, this stuff. Meanwhile, they're at an extremely good school and all of those things, but it's a lack of acknowledgement of reality, right. I mean, let me give you a sort of a trivial example. Personal example. I was in school, um, uh, in college in the late seventies, and I met a woman, um, later on in Cleveland, I met a woman whose father was a aeronautical engineer and he was about 10 years younger than my dad. And I said, she first said he was an engineer and I said, well, can I engineer? I thought she meant like a trained engineer and she said, aeronautical engineer. I said, your dad is an aeronautical engineer. I have to, where do you go to school? When she told me he went to school with a black school in the south and I said, I would imagine they're no more than five guys his age plus or minus 10 years with a degree in aeronautical engineering.

Speaker 1:          43:30          And she went back home and ask her dad and her dancing maybe five guides. He was, she was, she had no idea how weird this guy was. And so I met him, I talked with him and I said, would have, when you got out of school, I couldn't get a job. I wrote to everywhere, which wrote to Westinghouse. I wrote to every major company and nobody would hire me. And I was going to get on a freight and go to Mexico because I heard they were hiring. And right before they're going to get on the frightened, I had no money. I got a phone call from the government and began working for the government, rest of his life engineer now, um, in the 70s, I was in college and uh, excuse me in law school and I had a roommate who was an engineer, a computer engineer, and Dave, the companies recruited him like he was in, in c a and he had another good friend too.

Speaker 1:          44:16          Same thing, both of them. One of them ended up, um, a long career at Procter and gamble and made so much money that he dedicated a wing to the, to the computer school at Michigan. And the other one, my roommate, William, is still with TRW. Very good career there. They were recruited like rock and my girlfriend's father could not get a job as an engineer, uh, when he got out of school. That's a difference between, and that was an, and I was in, in law school in late seventies, at 40 years ago. You're telling me now things are much, much better than, than even then. And then they were recruited like rockstars, knock it off. Do your homework, graduated from high school. Don't have a kid before you're 20 years old and get married first and you will be just fine in America. Yeah. And it's so interesting how a healthy society deals with its past injustices because I use the examples of going to Monte Cello, you know, Thomas Jefferson's house where you take that tour.

Speaker 1:          45:09          They are very honest about his relationship to slavery that he was having an affair with at least one slave and affairs isn't right. Kind word to say. Uh, while, uh, while at the same time writing the laws that freed the slaves where I went to George Washington's house and he didn't free his half of the slaves until he died. It was in his will, but Martha still kept the other half. But they, but they acknowledge all of that and there's so many people that just want to point at them and say they were racists and this country was founded by them. They knew it was a cancer and it was, and that it was going to, um, uh, at some point after the point where we're, where something had to be done. They knew it. Ben Franklin, his last speech was a fiery speech, uh, urging the abolition of slavery.

Speaker 1:          45:51          In fact, he founded in a society for the abolition of slavery. So the, the founding fathers, uh, many of them were conflicted. Uh, but, uh, many of them were aware that this is something that we need to deal with energy. Know that in the constitution there's a specific date that says at this point, and this, there'll be no more importation of slaves and they goes 18, 24 and yet people want to want to kind of sit in this and not let us escape. And then, and then it leads to identity politics on the left, which then I think is the reason that we now have a, a version of identity politics on the right. And then, and that were caught. Well, 7 billion people, uh, are in the world and I dare say it, and most of them would trade places with us if they could.

Speaker 1:          46:30          Yeah. Uh, and most Americans, many Americans, unfortunately don't, don't seem to appreciate that. Yeah. All right. So let's talk about California a little bit in La in particular because as you said, born and bred in La. Um, south central, if I'm not mistaken right now they call it south la because south central has a negative connotation. So they moved it and now they call it [inaudible]. That's very fancy, very fancy. Um, but we actually live about 10 minutes away from me for another tell how old somebody is in La, if they refer to the area where I grew up in south central, south north of 50 calls the south central. Anybody south of 50 calls it, I did not even know it was south la now, but that's, I knew there was a west La, I didn't even, I used to call us. I knew there was east La, south central became synonymous with black la and that's racist.

Speaker 1:          47:12          So therefore they stopped doing it. I think also real tourist didn't like it either. They didn't like the area of being called south central because it meant the property values might, uh, might not be as high. Yeah. Well, we also have an area here, Baldwin hills that's known as the black right. Beverly Hills. And actually when I was going to buy a house when I was, I ended up at this, I went to Baldwin Hills. Beautiful area and it's gorgeous. I didn't know, I actually didn't know that it was known as the Black Beverly Hills. And obviously that wouldn't have bothered me or anything. But when I went to the house and I'm looking at the house and it's actually pretty nice and the prices pretty, pretty decent relative to whatever, cause there's some oil things over there and whatever else. Um, I remember the realtor was like, and you, you know, it's 90% black and 6% Hispanic and 2% white or something.

Speaker 1:          47:54          And I was like, all right. All right. All right. Yeah, it's okay. We're all, we're all humans. All right. But I want to talk about La and California in general because I do sense that because progressive politics have gone so bananas here. And you referenced San Francisco earlier and I was just there and our car got broken into and they stole my bag. And it, you know, basically 10 o'clock at night in front of a nice restaurant and the, and I literally saw someone shooting up and they were, they were homeless tents and all of this stuff. I think that because progressive politics have gone so overboard that there is a little bit of a libertarian streak started to take root here. I took a deep breath in, as I said, I hope you're right because the homelessness problem is massive. Uh, our budgets are terrible.

Speaker 1:          48:42          The fastest growing item on the budget is a unfunded pension liabilities from all the, uh, generous packages that we've given a garment workers. Those workers are our young, many of them, I think in California, I read there about 10,000 former government workers, they get pensions have $100,000 a year or more for the rest of their lives, which are adjusted for cost of living far more generous than any pension you get in the private sector. So when you could get one in the first place. So that's on automatic pilot and we're driving away businesses with all the taxes. California has been rated the worst state in which to do business for every single year. A magazine called CEO Magazine has been in business a and small business. People have also rated it as one of the worst places in which to do business. That's why we're losing in a Digitas population.

Speaker 1:          49:25          People born and raised in California, going to places like Texas and Nevada and Florida. It's interesting. I was in Denver last week and uh, the Uber driver was showing me how there's Denver just exploding right now. They're just, the whole area is exploding and all the rural areas are just becoming bigger and bigger and bigger and the guy goes, well, you know, we got lower taxes here in Colorado, so all you rich California people are coming here. So we're, we're really, I mean, people really need to understand that people eventually decide to use the foot vote and go, all right, I'm sick of paying these taxes. I'm going to go live in a mansion where I can only live in a apartment. A little go and you go online and see it. There's a, there's a, there's a, there's an online site that shows where the money goes, tax revenues and where and where it's going.

Speaker 1:          50:05          Where is it going? And it's going, it's going to look to the so called red states. States like Wyoming, a state like that are, are, are, are finding a blooming population and states like Illinois, uh, and California and Connecticut are losing indigenous population to other states. Yeah. Because of the taxes in the regulations. Do you think there's any chance some of this could be reversed here? You've been here for a long, they had longer. I've only been here for five years and I'm slightly hopeful. Here's the problem with California. The demographics are not in our favor. Uh, in 19, uh, I think it was 80, 1994, I think it was prompted, you want 87 passed. Talk about a quote, harsh, uh, anti illegal immigration law. When you tell me what 87 for bad illegals using education funds, uh, did not allow, uh, illegal aliens to use any medical funds except for emergency.

Speaker 1:          50:57          So no, no education, no healthcare, no nothing. Illegal aliens. It passed among whites. It passed among blacks, it passed among Hispanics, uh, excuse me, pass them on Asians. It did not pass a course about Hispanics at the time. The Hispanic vote in California with maybe 20, 10%. Now it's about 25%. And it's, and it's rising. And Hispanics believe, especially those from Mexico, Republicans are racist and they only care about the rich la times did a study and asked them questions like that. And those are the two responses that were the most frequent. Republicans are racist, only care about the rich, selfish and only care about the rich. Uh, and they don't come from a libertarian point of view at a federalist point of view. They don't know from, uh, from Thomas Jefferson, from Article One, section eight of the constitution, which limits the federal government to a handful of things, leaving everything else to the states and the individuals, they don't know from that.

Speaker 1:          51:52          So the point is, we got our work cut out for us. Listen, we could do this forever. That was a quick freaking hour. And I know you've got a hard out cause you got it. You got it. Yeah. Yeah, I have a radio show to do right now. Got a radio show to do. Um, all right, we're going to do the heavier fans. Follow me on Twitter at Larry elder at Larry elder. I'm a pro. It's all right there. Follow him on Twitter and I've got a book called the elders statement. Elder statement.com. Yeah. What are you going to bring the mustache back? Every time I Google image search you and there's, I'm gonna rock the flowback. You see my picture? That picture? I retweeted that picture because you add I wasn't, that was like, uh, well what happened is this troll said, you think your wife, you've always wanted to be white.

Speaker 1:          52:28          You probably always want to be white. And so I said, really? And I put that picture of that one out today. I want to, I want to share it. So I will be looking at saying, all right, man, listen, it's a pleasure. There is a place, I don't want to mention it on air. Uh, but there is a new restaurant right in between our houses. Like right in between that is freaking awesome. Right around here. I'm taking it out. Say the word for dinner. You and your girlfriend, you've got it. It's been a pleasure, my friend. I'm sorry. We have to do this real quick. We're, we're to, we'll do this again. All right. Power to the people. Death to the fascist pig. I can't do better than that. And communication.
