00:00:00.451 --> 00:00:02.625
- [Voiceover] A lot of
what geometry is about

00:00:02.625 --> 00:00:05.003
is proving things about the world.

00:00:05.003 --> 00:00:08.477
And in order to really prove
things about the world,

00:00:08.477 --> 00:00:11.036
we have to be very careful, very precise,

00:00:11.036 --> 00:00:12.702
very exact with our language

00:00:12.702 --> 00:00:14.064
so that we know what we're proving

00:00:14.064 --> 00:00:16.056
and we know what we're assuming

00:00:16.056 --> 00:00:19.104
and what type of deductions we are making

00:00:19.104 --> 00:00:20.871
as we prove things.

00:00:20.871 --> 00:00:23.450
And so, to get some practice being precise

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:25.177
and exact with our language,

00:00:25.177 --> 00:00:27.087
I'm going to go through some exercises

00:00:27.087 --> 00:00:31.663
from the Geometric Definitions Exercise

00:00:31.663 --> 00:00:34.038
on Khan Academy.

00:00:34.038 --> 00:00:36.688
So this first one says,
"Three students attempt

00:00:36.688 --> 00:00:39.817
"to define what it means for lines l and m

00:00:39.817 --> 00:00:41.727
"to be perpendicular.

00:00:41.727 --> 00:00:45.201
"Can you match the teacher's
comments to the definitions?"

00:00:45.201 --> 00:00:47.030
All right. So looks like
three different students

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.505
attempt definitions of what
it means to be perpendicular,

00:00:50.505 --> 00:00:52.178
and then there's these teacher's comments

00:00:52.178 --> 00:00:54.088
that we can move around.

00:00:54.088 --> 00:00:56.465
So we're gonna, I guess,
pretend that we're the teacher.

00:00:56.465 --> 00:00:59.553
So Ruby's definition
for being perpendicular:

00:00:59.553 --> 00:01:02.926
"l and m," lines l and
m, "are perpendicular

00:01:02.926 --> 00:01:04.876
"if they never meet."

00:01:04.876 --> 00:01:06.176
Well, that's not true.

00:01:06.176 --> 00:01:09.874
In fact, perpendicular lines
for sure will intersect.

00:01:09.874 --> 00:01:12.455
So, in fact, they
intersect at right angles.

00:01:12.455 --> 00:01:14.181
So that is not going to be,

00:01:14.181 --> 00:01:15.791
that's not going to be correct.

00:01:15.791 --> 00:01:17.071
And so, actually this looks right.

00:01:17.071 --> 00:01:18.716
"Were you thinking of parallel lines?"

00:01:18.716 --> 00:01:21.581
Because that's looks like
what she was trying to define.

00:01:21.581 --> 00:01:24.994
If things are on the same
plane and they never intersect,

00:01:24.994 --> 00:01:28.164
then you are talking about parallel lines.

00:01:28.164 --> 00:01:30.399
I also got Shriya's definition.

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:33.995
"l and m are perpendicular
if the meet at one point

00:01:33.995 --> 00:01:36.839
"and one of the angles at
their point of intersection

00:01:36.839 --> 00:01:39.948
"is a right angle."
Well, that seems spot on.

00:01:39.948 --> 00:01:40.842
So let's see.

00:01:40.842 --> 00:01:43.158
I would say, "Woohoo! Nice Work!

00:01:43.158 --> 00:01:44.986
"I couldn't have said it better myself."

00:01:44.986 --> 00:01:46.490
Now let's just make sure this comment

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.257
matches for this definition.

00:01:48.257 --> 00:01:51.630
Abhishek says, "l and m are perpendicular

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.885
"if they meet at a single point,

00:01:53.885 --> 00:01:57.523
"such that the two lines make a 'T'."

00:01:57.523 --> 00:02:01.423
Well, that's, in a hand-wavy
way, kind of right.

00:02:01.423 --> 00:02:04.157
When you imagine perpendicular lines,

00:02:04.157 --> 00:02:05.782
you could imagine them kind of forming

00:02:05.782 --> 00:02:08.484
a cross or, I guess, part of ...

00:02:08.484 --> 00:02:10.468
You know, a T would be part of it.

00:02:10.468 --> 00:02:12.731
But I think this comment is spot-on.

00:02:12.731 --> 00:02:15.435
The teacher's comment, "Your
definition is kind of correct,

00:02:15.435 --> 00:02:17.670
"but it lacks mathematical precision."

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.844
You know, what does he mean by a T?

00:02:19.844 --> 00:02:23.074
What does it mean to "make a T"?

00:02:23.074 --> 00:02:25.207
Shriya's definition is much more precise.

00:02:25.207 --> 00:02:26.711
They're perpendicular "if
they meet at one point

00:02:26.711 --> 00:02:29.311
"and one of their angles at
their point of intersection

00:02:29.311 --> 00:02:32.461
"is a right angle," is a 90 degree angle.

00:02:32.461 --> 00:02:33.923
Let's check our answers.

00:02:33.923 --> 00:02:34.980
Let's do a few more of these.

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.524
This is actually a lot of fun.

00:02:36.524 --> 00:02:38.474
So once again, we're
gonna have three students

00:02:38.474 --> 00:02:40.465
attempting to define, but
now they're going to define

00:02:40.465 --> 00:02:43.025
"an object called an angle."

00:02:43.025 --> 00:02:45.870
"Can you match the teacher's
comments to the definitions?"

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.166
So Ruby, oh, it's three,
same three students.

00:02:48.166 --> 00:02:52.574
Ruby says, "The amount of turn
between two straight lines

00:02:52.574 --> 00:02:56.272
"that have a common vertex."

00:02:56.272 --> 00:02:59.482
Well, this is kind of getting there.

00:02:59.482 --> 00:03:02.388
The definition of an angle,
we typically talk about

00:03:02.388 --> 00:03:05.720
two rays with a common vertex.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.072
She's talking about two
lines with a common vertex.

00:03:09.072 --> 00:03:11.815
And she's talking about
the amount of turn.

00:03:11.815 --> 00:03:13.359
So she's really talk
about more of, kind of,

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:15.167
the measure of an angle.

00:03:15.167 --> 00:03:17.381
So let's see what comment here.

00:03:17.381 --> 00:03:19.076
So, "You seem to be getting at the idea

00:03:19.076 --> 00:03:20.275
"of the measure of an angle,

00:03:20.275 --> 00:03:21.720
and "not the definition
of the angle itself."

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:22.482
So this is actually right.

00:03:22.482 --> 00:03:23.661
I would put this one right here.

00:03:23.661 --> 00:03:24.821
We just got lucky.

00:03:24.821 --> 00:03:26.504
This was already aligned.

00:03:26.504 --> 00:03:30.143
So Shriya's definition: "Two
lines that come together."

00:03:30.143 --> 00:03:32.224
So, once again, this is kind of ...

00:03:32.224 --> 00:03:37.192
The definition of an angle is
two rays with a common vertex.

00:03:37.192 --> 00:03:38.706
So, "Two lines that come together,"

00:03:38.706 --> 00:03:40.168
this is just intersecting lines.

00:03:40.168 --> 00:03:42.647
Now, when that happens, you
might be forming some angles,

00:03:42.647 --> 00:03:44.983
but I would just say, "Were you thinking

00:03:44.983 --> 00:03:46.894
of intersecting lines?"

00:03:46.894 --> 00:03:48.946
And let's see what Abhishek says.

00:03:48.946 --> 00:03:52.744
"A figure composed of two rays
sharing a common endpoint.

00:03:52.744 --> 00:03:55.183
"The common endpoint is
known as the vertex."

00:03:55.183 --> 00:03:59.612
Yup. That's a good definition of an angle.

00:03:59.612 --> 00:04:01.927
So Abhishek got it this time.

00:04:01.927 --> 00:04:03.269
Let's do another one.

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:05.645
So three students are
now attempting to define

00:04:05.645 --> 00:04:08.347
"what it means for two
lines to be parallel."

00:04:08.347 --> 00:04:10.196
So now let's match the teacher's comments.

00:04:10.196 --> 00:04:12.615
So Daniela says, "Two lines are parallel

00:04:12.615 --> 00:04:16.353
"if they are distinct
and one can be translated

00:04:16.353 --> 00:04:19.402
"on top of the other."

00:04:19.402 --> 00:04:20.817
All right.

00:04:20.817 --> 00:04:24.007
So that actually seems pretty interesting.

00:04:24.007 --> 00:04:24.983
That's actually not the first way

00:04:24.983 --> 00:04:26.792
that I would have defined parallel lines.

00:04:26.792 --> 00:04:28.639
I would have said, "Hey, if
they're on the same plane

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:31.485
"and they don't intersect,
then they are parallel."

00:04:31.485 --> 00:04:32.987
But this is, this seems pretty good

00:04:32.987 --> 00:04:35.161
because, if you're translating something,

00:04:35.161 --> 00:04:39.285
you're not, you aren't going to rotate it,

00:04:39.285 --> 00:04:41.056
you're not going to change its direction,

00:04:41.056 --> 00:04:42.520
I guess, one way to think about it.

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:43.982
And so, if you're translating one ...

00:04:43.982 --> 00:04:44.856
If you can trans-

00:04:44.856 --> 00:04:46.359
If they're two different lines,

00:04:46.359 --> 00:04:50.077
but you can shift them without
changing their direction,

00:04:50.077 --> 00:04:51.704
which is what translation is all about,

00:04:51.704 --> 00:04:54.324
on top of each other, that
actually feels pretty good.

00:04:54.324 --> 00:04:57.323
So, I'll put that right over there.

00:04:57.323 --> 00:05:00.044
So Ori says, "Two lines are parallel

00:05:00.044 --> 00:05:03.080
"if they are close together
but don't intersect."

00:05:03.896 --> 00:05:06.843
So, if you're trying to
define parallel lines,

00:05:06.843 --> 00:05:08.203
parallel lines, it doesn't matter

00:05:08.203 --> 00:05:10.905
if they're close together or not.

00:05:10.905 --> 00:05:12.074
It's, they just have to be

00:05:12.074 --> 00:05:13.751
in the same plane and not intersect.

00:05:13.751 --> 00:05:17.144
They can be very far apart and
they could still be parallel.

00:05:17.144 --> 00:05:19.399
So this isn't an incorrect statement.

00:05:19.399 --> 00:05:21.349
You could have two lines
that are close together

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:22.995
and don't intersect on the same plane,

00:05:22.995 --> 00:05:25.173
and they are going to be parallel.

00:05:25.173 --> 00:05:26.635
But this isn't a good definition,

00:05:26.635 --> 00:05:28.222
because you can also have parallel lines

00:05:28.222 --> 00:05:29.725
that are far apart.

00:05:29.725 --> 00:05:32.791
And so, actually I'd go with
this statement right here:

00:05:32.791 --> 00:05:34.112
"Part of your definition is correct,

00:05:34.112 --> 00:05:35.230
"but the other part is not.

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:37.952
"Parallel lines don't have
to be close together."

00:05:37.952 --> 00:05:39.882
So this isn't a good
definition of parallel lines.

00:05:39.882 --> 00:05:42.423
So let's see. Kaori:
"Two lines are parallel

00:05:42.423 --> 00:05:44.839
"as long as they aren't perpendicular."

00:05:44.839 --> 00:05:46.242
Well, that's just not true,

00:05:46.242 --> 00:05:47.846
because you can intersect,

00:05:47.846 --> 00:05:49.492
you can have two lines that intersect

00:05:49.492 --> 00:05:52.336
at non-right angles, and
they're not parallel,

00:05:52.336 --> 00:05:54.185
and they're also not perpendicular.

00:05:54.185 --> 00:05:57.071
So this is, you know, "Sorry,
your definition is incorrect."

00:05:57.071 --> 00:05:58.025
This is actually a lot of fun,

00:05:58.025 --> 00:05:59.488
pretending to be the teacher.

00:05:59.488 --> 00:06:01.621
Let's do another one.

00:06:02.682 --> 00:06:04.084
All right.

00:06:04.084 --> 00:06:06.398
So "Three students attempt to define

00:06:06.398 --> 00:06:08.653
"what a line segment is."

00:06:08.653 --> 00:06:12.205
And we have a depiction of a
line segment right over here.

00:06:12.205 --> 00:06:15.036
We have point P, point
Q, and the line segment

00:06:15.036 --> 00:06:18.307
is all the points in between P and Q.

00:06:18.307 --> 00:06:22.732
So, so let's match the teacher's comments

00:06:22.732 --> 00:06:24.154
to the definitions.

00:06:24.154 --> 00:06:26.788
Ivy's definition: "All of the points

00:06:26.788 --> 00:06:30.331
"in line with P and Q,
extending infinitely

00:06:30.331 --> 00:06:32.098
"in both directions."

00:06:32.098 --> 00:06:34.089
Well, that would be the
definition of a line.

00:06:34.089 --> 00:06:35.786
That would be the line P, Q.

00:06:35.786 --> 00:06:37.412
That would be, if you're
extending infinitely

00:06:37.412 --> 00:06:39.999
in both directions, so ...

00:06:40.573 --> 00:06:41.966
I would say, "Are you thinking of a line

00:06:41.966 --> 00:06:44.237
"instead of a line segment?"

00:06:44.237 --> 00:06:47.691
Ethan's definition: "The
exact distance from P to Q.

00:06:47.691 --> 00:06:48.576
Well, that's just a ...

00:06:48.576 --> 00:06:52.195
that's the length of a line segment.

00:06:52.195 --> 00:06:54.957
That's not exactly what a line segment is.

00:06:54.957 --> 00:06:57.030
And see, Ebuka's definition.

00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:00.401
"The points P and Q, which
are called endpoints,

00:07:00.401 --> 00:07:02.067
"and all of the points in a straight line

00:07:02.067 --> 00:07:03.895
"between points P and Q.

00:07:03.895 --> 00:07:06.150
Yep. That looks like a good definition

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:08.914
for a line segment.

00:07:08.914 --> 00:07:10.762
So we can just check our,

00:07:10.762 --> 00:07:12.536
we can just check our answer.

00:07:13.658 --> 00:07:14.776
So, looking good.

00:07:14.776 --> 00:07:15.893
Let's do one more of this.

00:07:15.893 --> 00:07:18.612
I'm just really enjoying
pretending to be a teacher.

00:07:19.348 --> 00:07:21.217
All right. "Three
students attempt to define

00:07:21.217 --> 00:07:23.046
"what a circle is."

00:07:23.046 --> 00:07:24.427
Define what a circle is.

00:07:24.427 --> 00:07:26.114
"Can you match the teacher's
comments to the definitions?"

00:07:26.114 --> 00:07:29.060
Duru. "The set of all points in a plane

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:32.087
"that are the same distance
away from some given point,

00:07:32.087 --> 00:07:33.794
"which we call the center."

00:07:33.794 --> 00:07:36.516
That just seems like a pretty
good definition of a circle.

00:07:36.516 --> 00:07:39.299
So, I would, you know,
"Stupendous! Well done."

00:07:39.299 --> 00:07:41.656
Oliver's definition.

00:07:41.656 --> 00:07:44.704
"The set of all points in 3D space

00:07:44.704 --> 00:07:47.489
"that are the same distance
from a center point."

00:07:47.489 --> 00:07:48.971
If we're talking about 3D space

00:07:48.971 --> 00:07:50.880
and the set of all points
that are equidistant

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:52.404
from that point in 3D space,

00:07:52.404 --> 00:07:55.167
now we're talking about
a sphere, not a circle.

00:07:55.167 --> 00:07:57.546
And so, "You seem to be confusing

00:07:57.546 --> 00:07:59.557
"a circle with a sphere."

00:07:59.557 --> 00:08:03.275
And then, finally, "A
perfectly round shape."

00:08:03.275 --> 00:08:06.118
Well, that's kind of true.

00:08:06.118 --> 00:08:07.703
But if you're talk about three dimensions,

00:08:07.703 --> 00:08:09.267
you could be talking about a sphere.

00:08:09.267 --> 00:08:11.096
If you're talking about, if
you go beyond three dimensions,

00:08:11.096 --> 00:08:12.802
hypersphere, whatever else.

00:08:12.802 --> 00:08:14.875
In two dimensions, yeah,
perfectly round shape,

00:08:14.875 --> 00:08:16.683
most people would call it a circle.

00:08:16.683 --> 00:08:18.572
But that doesn't have a
lot of precision to it.

00:08:18.572 --> 00:08:20.238
It doesn't have, it doesn't give us a lot

00:08:20.238 --> 00:08:23.062
that we can work with from a
mathematical point of view.

00:08:23.062 --> 00:08:25.094
So I would say, actually,
what the teacher's saying:

00:08:25.094 --> 00:08:27.634
"Your definition needs
to be much more precise."

00:08:27.634 --> 00:08:30.742
Duru's definition is
much, much more precise.

00:08:30.742 --> 00:08:34.143
The set of all points that
are equidistant from ...

00:08:34.143 --> 00:08:36.228
in a plane, that are equidistant away

00:08:36.228 --> 00:08:38.648
from a given point,
which we call the center.

00:08:38.648 --> 00:08:42.451
So yep. Carlos could use a
little bit more precision.

00:08:43.594 --> 00:08:45.072
We're all done.
