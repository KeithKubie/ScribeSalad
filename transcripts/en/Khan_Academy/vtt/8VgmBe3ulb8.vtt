00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.670
Let's see if we can learn
a thing or two about even

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:06.940
functions and odd functions.

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:10.210
So even functions, and on the
right-hand side over here,

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:12.210
we'll talk about odd functions.

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.790
If we have time, we'll
talk about functions

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.230
that are neither even nor odd.

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.001
So before I go into kind
of a formal definition

00:00:21.001 --> 00:00:22.750
of even functions, I
just want to show you

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.305
what they look like visually,
because I think that's probably

00:00:25.305 --> 00:00:26.830
the easiest way
to recognize them.

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:29.260
And then it'll also make
a little bit more sense

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.670
when we talk about the formal
definition of an even function.

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:37.490
So let me draw some
coordinate axes here, x-axis.

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:39.940
And then, let me
see if I can draw

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.630
that a little bit straighter.

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.720
This right over
here is my y-axis,

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.060
or I could say y is equal to
f of x axis, just like that.

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:53.700
And then let me draw
the graph of f of x.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.720
f of x is equal
to x-squared, or y

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.690
is equal to
x-squared, either one.

00:00:58.690 --> 00:00:59.650
So let me draw it.

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.020
In the first quadrant,
it looks like this.

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:07.140
And then in the second
quadrant, it looks like this.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.810
It looks like-- oh, let me try
to draw it so it's symmetric.

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.800
Pretty good job.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:19.486
The f of x is equal to x
squared is an even function.

00:01:19.486 --> 00:01:20.860
And the way that
you recognize it

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.440
is because it has this
symmetry around the y-axis.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.800
If you take what's going
on on the right-hand side,

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.680
to the right of the y-axis,
and you just reflect it

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.180
over the y-axis, you get the
other side of the function.

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.940
And that's what tells you
it is an even function.

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.700
And I want to show you one
interesting property here.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.570
If you take any
x-value-- let's say

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:44.940
you take a positive x-value.

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.270
Let's say you take the
value, x is equal to 2.

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.220
If you find f of 2,
that's going to be 4.

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.873
That's going to be 4 for this
particular function for f

00:01:54.873 --> 00:01:56.250
of x is equal to x squared.

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.920
2 squared is equal to 4.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.340
And if you took the
negative version of 2--

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.760
so if you took negative 2,
and you evaluated the function

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.520
there, you are also
going to get 4.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.820
And this, hopefully, or maybe
makes complete sense to you.

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.125
You're like, well, Sal,
obviously if I just

00:02:16.125 --> 00:02:18.810
reflect this function
over the y-axis, that's

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:19.700
going to be the case.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.244
Whatever function value I get at
the positive value of a number,

00:02:24.244 --> 00:02:25.660
I'm going to get
the same function

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.260
value at the negative value.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.450
And this is what kind of leads
us to the formal definition.

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.970
If a function is even--
or I could say a function

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.940
is even if and only
of-- so it's even.

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.450
And don't get confused
between the term even function

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:42.760
and the term even number.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.480
They're completely
different kind of ideas.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.680
So there's not, at least
an obvious connection

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.270
that I know of, between even
functions and even numbers

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.450
or odd functions
and odd numbers.

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.500
So you're an even
function if and only

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:03.570
if, f of x is equal
to f of negative x.

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.620
And the reason why I
didn't introduce this

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:06.780
from the beginning--
because this is really

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.030
the definition of
an even function--

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.655
is when you look at this, you're
like hey, what does this mean?

00:03:10.655 --> 00:03:12.340
f of x is equal to
f of negative x.

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.250
And all it does mean is this.

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.990
It means that if I were to
take f of 2, f of 2 is 4.

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:20.610
So let me show you with
a particular case. f of 2

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:25.230
is equal to f of negative 2.

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.615
And this particular case for
f of x is equal to x squared,

00:03:28.615 --> 00:03:32.740
they are both equal to 4.

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.220
So really, this is
just another way

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.010
of saying that the
function can be reflected,

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.870
or the left side of the
function is the reflection

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.750
of the right side
of the function

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.410
across the vertical
axis, across the y-axis.

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.040
Now just to make sure we have
a decent understanding here,

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.190
let me draw a few
more even functions.

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.030
And I'm going to draw some
fairly wacky things just so you

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.770
really kind of learn to
visually recognize them.

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:08.510
So let's say a
function like this,

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:13.176
it maybe jumps up
to here, and maybe

00:04:13.176 --> 00:04:15.250
it does something like that.

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.240
And then on this side,
it does the same thing.

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:20.310
It's the reflection,
so it jumps up here,

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.420
then it goes like this,
then it goes like this.

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:26.810
I'm trying to draw it so it's
the mirror image of each other.

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.280
This is an even function.

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.440
You take what's going
on on the right hand

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.150
side of this function and
you literally just reflect it

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:38.046
over the y-axis, and you get the
left hand side of the function.

00:04:38.046 --> 00:04:39.670
And you could see
that even this holds.

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:45.320
If I take some value-- let's say
that this value right here is,

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:46.810
I don't know, 3.

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:52.720
And let's say that f of 3 over
here is equal to, let's say,

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.000
that that is 5.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.160
So this is 5.

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:02.340
We see that f of negative 3 is
also going to be equal to 5.

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:06.030
And that's what our definition
of an even function told us.

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:09.860
And I can draw, let me just draw
one more to really make sure.

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.780
I'll do the axis in
that same green color.

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:16.750
Let me do one more like this.

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:21.280
And you could have maybe some
type of trigonometric looking

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:27.380
function that looks like
this, that looks like that.

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:30.280
And it keeps going
in either direction.

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.950
So something like this
would also be even.

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:34.510
So all of these
are even functions.

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:38.460
Now, you are probably thinking,
well, what is an odd function?

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.590
And let me draw an
odd function for you.

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:45.110
So let me draw the
axis once again.

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:49.650
x-axis, y-axis, or
the f of x-axis.

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:52.620
And to show you an
odd function, I'll

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:55.040
give you a particular odd
function, maybe the most famous

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:56.190
of the odd functions.

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:58.870
This is probably the most
famous of the even functions.

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:01.820
And it is f of x--
although there are probably

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.160
other contenders for
most famous odd function.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.440
f of x is equal to x
to the third power.

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:10.350
And it looks like-- you might
have seen the graph of it.

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:13.690
If you haven't, you can graph
it by trying some points.

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:15.650
It looks like that.

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:19.140
And the way to visually
recognize an odd function

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:22.945
is you look at what's going
on to the right of the y-axis.

00:06:22.945 --> 00:06:25.070
Once again, this is the
y-axis, this is the x-axis.

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:27.970
You have all of this business
to the right of the y-axis.

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:30.330
If you reflect it
over the y-axis,

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:33.605
you would get
something like this.

00:06:33.605 --> 00:06:35.980
And if the left side of this
graph looked like this, then

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:37.730
we would be dealing
with an even function.

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:38.940
Clearly it doesn't.

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:42.520
To make this an odd function, we
reflect it once over the y-axis

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:44.750
and then reflect
it over the x-axis.

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:46.230
Or another way to
think about it,

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:49.714
reflect it once over the y-axis
and then make it negative.

00:06:49.714 --> 00:06:51.130
Either way, it
will get you there.

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:53.940
Or you could even reflect
it over the x-axis and then

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:56.250
the y-axis, so you are kind
of doing two reflections.

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:58.020
And so clearly if
you take this up here

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:02.520
and then you reflect it over the
x-axis, you get these values,

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:05.510
you get this part of the
graph right over here.

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:08.750
And if you try to do it
with a particular point,

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:11.990
and I'm doing this to kind of
hint at what the definition,

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:14.860
the formal definition of an
odd function is going to be.

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:18.130
Let's try a point,
let's try 2 again.

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:21.070
If you had the point
2, f of 2 is 8.

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:24.780
So f of 2 is equal to 8.

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:28.820
Now what happens if
we take negative 2?

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:32.830
f of negative 2, negative
2 to the third power,

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:34.710
that's just going
to be negative 8.

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:38.970
So f of negative 2 is
equal to negative 8.

00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:41.780
And in general, if we take-- so
let me just write it over here.

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:44.730
f of 2-- so we're just
doing one particular example

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:47.510
from this particular function.

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:53.240
We have f of 2 is equal
to, not f of negative 2.

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:55.010
8 does not equal negative 8.

00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:57.965
8 is equal to the
negative of negative 8

00:07:57.965 --> 00:07:59.620
because that's positive 8.

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:05.446
So f of 2 is equal to the
negative of f of negative 2.

00:08:05.446 --> 00:08:07.320
We figured out-- just
want to make it clear--

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:09.240
we figured out f of 2 is 8.

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:10.690
2 to the third power is 8.

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:14.220
We know that f of
negative 2 is negative 8.

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:16.080
Negative 2 to the third
power is negative 8.

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:18.550
So you have the
negative of negative 8,

00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:20.690
negatives cancel out,
and it works out.

00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:23.110
So in general, you
have an odd function.

00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:25.070
So here's the definition.

00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:27.440
You are dealing
with an odd function

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:32.190
if and only if f of
x for all the x's

00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:35.289
that are defined on that
function, or for which

00:08:35.289 --> 00:08:37.730
that function is
defined, if f of x

00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:41.104
is equal to the negative
of f of negative x.

00:08:41.104 --> 00:08:42.770
Or you'll sometimes
see it the other way

00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:46.880
if you multiply both sides of
this equation by negative 1,

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:51.946
you would get negative f of x
is equal to f of negative x.

00:08:51.946 --> 00:08:53.320
And sometimes
you'll see it where

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:56.200
it's swapped around where
they'll say f of negative x

00:08:56.200 --> 00:09:02.900
is equal to-- let me
write that careful--

00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:06.310
is equal to negative f of x.

00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:08.540
I just swapped these two sides.

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:12.160
So let me just draw you
some more odd functions.

00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:17.600
So I'll do these visually.

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:21.950
So let me draw that
a little bit cleaner.

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:27.350
So if you have
maybe the function

00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:33.760
does something wacky like
this on the right hand side.

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:36.090
If it was even, you
would reflect it there.

00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:37.590
But we want to have
an odd function,

00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:39.110
so we're going to
reflect it again.

00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:41.700
So the rest of the function
is going to look like this.

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:43.930
So what I've drawn in
the non-dotted lines,

00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:45.941
this right here is
an odd function.

00:09:45.941 --> 00:09:47.690
And you could even
look at the definition.

00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:51.310
If you take some
value, a, and then

00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:53.820
you take f of a, which
would put you up here.

00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:55.260
This right here would be f of a.

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:56.910
If you take the
negative value of that,

00:09:56.910 --> 00:10:00.580
if you took negative a
here, f of negative a

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:02.100
is going to be down here.

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:07.200
So f of negative
a, it's going to be

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:09.110
the same distance from
the horizontal axis.

00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:11.740
It's not completely clear
the way I drew it just now.

00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:14.200
So it's maybe going to
be like right over here.

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:18.230
So this right over here is going
to be f of negative a, which

00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:21.160
is the same distance from
the origin as f of a,

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:22.710
it's just the negative.

00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:24.570
I didn't completely
draw it to scale.

00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:28.020
Let me draw one more
of these odd functions.

00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:29.470
I think you might get the point.

00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:31.190
Actually, I'll draw a very
simple odd function, just

00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:32.606
to show you that
it doesn't always

00:10:32.606 --> 00:10:34.220
have to be something crazy.

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:37.650
So a very simple
odd function would

00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:44.520
be y is equal to x,
something like this.

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:45.800
Whoops.

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:49.490
y is equal going
through the origin.

00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:51.669
You reflect what's on the
right onto to the left.

00:10:51.669 --> 00:10:52.210
You get that.

00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:53.585
And then you
reflect it down, you

00:10:53.585 --> 00:10:55.540
get all of this stuff
in the third quadrant.

00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:57.900
So this is also an odd function.

00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:00.260
Now, I want to leave
you with a few things

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.570
that are not odd functions
and that sometimes might

00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:05.590
be confused to be odd functions.

00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:09.340
So you might have
something like this

00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:13.430
where maybe you have a
parabola, but it's not

00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:14.830
symmetric around the y-axis.

00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:16.496
And your temptation
might be, hey, there

00:11:16.496 --> 00:11:18.070
is this symmetry
for this parabola.

00:11:18.070 --> 00:11:22.600
But it's not being
reflected around the y-axis.

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:24.880
You don't have a situation
here where f of x

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:27.830
is equal to f of negative x.

00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:32.600
So this is neither odd nor even.

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:35.160
Similarly, you
might see, let's say

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:39.090
you see a shifted
cubic function.

00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:41.790
So say you have
something like this.

00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:46.350
Let's say you have x
to the third plus 1.

00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:49.320
So f of x is equal to
x to the third plus 1,

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:51.520
so it might look
something like this.

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:53.120
And once again,
you will be tempted

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:54.450
to call this an odd function.

00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:58.040
But because it's shifted up, it
is no longer an odd function.

00:11:58.040 --> 00:11:59.290
You can look at that visually.

00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:03.510
So this is f of x is equal
to x to the third plus 1.

00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:05.620
If you take what's on
the right hand side

00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:07.920
and reflect it onto
to the left hand side,

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:09.650
you would get
something like that.

00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:11.450
And then if you were
to reflect that down,

00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:13.270
you would get
something like that.

00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:16.090
So this is not an odd function.

00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:19.860
This isn't the left
reflection and then

00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:21.497
the top-bottom
reflection of what's

00:12:21.497 --> 00:12:22.830
going on on the right hand side.

00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:25.890
This over here
actually would be.
