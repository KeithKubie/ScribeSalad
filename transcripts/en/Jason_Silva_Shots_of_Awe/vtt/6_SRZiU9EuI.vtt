00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:13.670
I remember reading
Alain De Botton's book

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:15.000
"The Art of Travel."

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.700
And I was extremely struck
by the power of this book

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.780
to make the suggestion--
to remind us,

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:23.880
rather-- that wherever
we go, you know,

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.320
whenever we head to
that "elsewhere",

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.420
to that anywhere-but-here,
we often

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.090
find that we have to bring
ourselves along for the ride.

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.570
We look at the
brochure, and we dream

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.260
about who we'll become
when we go to that place.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.006
We dream about that beach.

00:00:41.006 --> 00:00:42.130
We dream about that sunset.

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:46.650
We dream of what, of who, we
might become in that moment.

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:49.640
It's really about
hacking our reality.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.830
The journey is really a
desire for self-transcendence,

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:58.860
a desire for rebirth, a
desire for apotheosis.

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:59.990
It's a very powerful thing.

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:04.040
It's a very hard thing to hack
because of hedonic adaptation.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.360
Because familiarity,
because routines,

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.890
because traditional
modes of thought

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.930
blind us from the ecstasy
of the present moment.

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.400
They blind us from the
hardly bearable ecstasy

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.260
of direct energy exploding
in our nerve endings

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:18.635
when we dissolve
boundaries, when

00:01:18.635 --> 00:01:22.860
we are here in the
Now-- inspired,

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:29.050
experiencing revelatory ecstasy,
making time dilate because

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:30.920
of the poetry of this moment.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.120
We want that.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.130
We seek that illumination,
that catharsis,

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.910
that moment of letting go, of
losing ourselves and finding

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:42.380
ourselves.

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.640
Of being inspired,
of being moved

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.830
to tears by this exquisite
italization of the moment.

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.052
And yet it's so hard.

00:01:51.052 --> 00:01:51.760
So what do we do?

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:52.750
What do we do?

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.424
We create mantras, and we create
itineraries, and we do drugs--

00:01:56.424 --> 00:01:59.260
but it's elusive.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.110
That space, that liminal
space is so hard to tap into.

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:04.532
That flow.

00:02:04.532 --> 00:02:05.376
That flow.

00:02:05.376 --> 00:02:06.770
I'm searching for it, man.

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.918
That's why I love
that word-- hermenaut.

00:02:08.918 --> 00:02:10.669
The hermenaut, right?

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:12.274
Hermeneutics-- the
search for meaning.

00:02:12.274 --> 00:02:13.690
Astronaut-- you
know what that is.

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.370
Hermenaut is us.

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.030
We are the travelers in
search of signification.
