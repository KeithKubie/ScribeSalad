00:00:00.489 --> 00:00:01.489
Anthony: Hey guys.

00:00:01.489 --> 00:00:03.760
Anthony here in St. Petersburg at
the Imagine Cup

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:07.939
I got Alessandro here with me who is
one of the guys from the Hateya team.

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:10.809
You guys have come up with such an
amazing idea.

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:11.850
Tell me a little bit about this.

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:17.359
Alessandro: So we have, imagine a system which
is inside the a

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:18.359
firefighter's equipment

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.020
with augmented reality glasses.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:22.020
So

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.449
if a firefighter want to return to his
starting point an arrow is displayed through

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:27.449
the glasses.

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.050
Anthony: Where did this idea come from?

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:30.109
What made you want to do
this?

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:32.950
Alessandro: One day we saw on the news that
a

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.280
firefighter died because he didn't find the
the way out.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:41.430
Anthony: And one of the things that's interesting
to me about this, is you couldn't rely on

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.440
traditional GPS
and positioning right?

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.050
Alessandro: You're inside the building so
the signal

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.390
doesn't pass.

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:53.400
So we have to tackle this problem through
sensors like the gyroscope, the

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.900
compass, and the accelerometers.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.920
Anthony: You can send data to somebody outside
right?

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.430
Alessandro: Yeah that's right.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.420
So we also have made a system outside the
building.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.359
We call it the backoffice.

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:10.439
It's a Windows Store
application thats collect the data from the

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.220
solution
on the firefighter's jacket,

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:19.680
which is called the comeback, and so we are
able to to view the the cover path

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.179
of the fire fighters.

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:23.969
If firefighter need some rescue,

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:28.939
a signal is sent to the backoffice and

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:34.319
we establish a mesh architecture between
the comebacks in order to bring back the information.

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:38.920
So the supervisor outside the building can
send him somerescue.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.450
Anthony: You can't just put standard electronics
in right?

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:42.799
Cause it's a fiery building.

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:48.689
Alessandro: Of course because the sensors
have to be treated for extreme heat and extreme

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:49.810
areas.

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.789
So there are some specialized companies that
do that.

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:56.830
Anthony: What percentage of a fire department's
budget would this be?

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:03.850
Alessandro: Full firefighters equipment costs
about four or maybe three thousand dollars.

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:09.970
With all includes the helmet, the shoes, the
jacket.

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:15.360
And we create our solution for about 10 percent
of this initial cost.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.840
Anthony: For an extra three hundred dollars,
four hundred dollars, these suits get outfitted

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:20.840
with these sensors?

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:21.840
Alessandro: Yeah.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.490
The technology is there an it doesn't exist,
so we have created.

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:27.550
Anthony: That's so cool.

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.530
You guys are doing such great work man thank
you.

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.740
Remember we have so much more from the Imagine
Cup all week.

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.440
If you're wondering what the Imagine Cup is,
we have a whole video explaining it over on

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.610
Rev3Games.

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:39.610
YouTube.com/rev3games

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.630
We're also covering a ton of the games competition
over there.

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.480
