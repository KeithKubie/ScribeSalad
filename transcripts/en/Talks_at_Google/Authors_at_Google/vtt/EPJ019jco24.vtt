[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:12.794 --> 00:00:15.460
MAGNUS NILSSON: So first of all,
thank you all for coming today,

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:18.250
and thanks for having
me again at Google.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:19.630
It's always very
nice to be here.

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.580
So I've written a few books now.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:25.780
And this latest one--

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:28.210
"The Nordic Baking
Book"-- it actually marks

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.840
the end to a six
year research process

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.350
that's produced "The Nordic
Cookbook" after three years

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.100
and now finishes with
this publication.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.140
And the whole purpose of these
books were to be documentary

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.290
and to tell people about Nordic
food culture in a true way.

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.050
Because I think that
Nordic food culture

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.360
is one of the most misunderstood
food cultures on the planet.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.670
I mean, largely because of
people like myself, actually.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.210
Because if you search on
the internet for Nordic food

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.310
culture, Nordic cooking,
things like that,

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:08.110
the first thing you get up is
1,000 articles about Faviken,

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.770
and Noma, and a handful of other
very ambitious contemporary

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:12.760
restaurants.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.420
And none of them really are
very indicative of how people

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.036
actually eat in the Nordics.

00:01:19.036 --> 00:01:20.410
And then, aside
of that, you also

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:25.960
get a whole bunch of recipes
for gravlax, for herring,

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.870
and for meatballs,
and cinnamon buns.

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.510
And those are Nordic dishes,
but that's not really

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:33.670
what people eat on an
everyday basis either.

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.200
And then the last
thing you get is

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.960
a lot of people photographing
their meatball meal at Ikea.

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.420
So I felt that there was a
real need for these books.

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:45.920
And it's been an
enormous privilege

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.770
to get to spend this long--

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.290
supported by a publisher--

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.116
researching my own food culture.

00:01:54.116 --> 00:01:56.980
A food culture that I
thought I knew a lot about,

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:59.360
and that it turned out that
I knew a lot less than I

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.000
thought about.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.910
And it's a little bit strange
now to see both books out,

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:09.199
the project being done.

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:12.710
But it's also amazing to see
people interact with both

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:16.240
of the books, tagging me
in photos on social media,

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.050
or buns they've made.

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.930
People coming to these
lectures and really

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.960
learning about the food
culture that I think they

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.380
knew very little about before.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.200
And one thing that I
learned, especially

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.390
during the second
half of this project,

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.080
is how great the
diversity and the depth

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.450
is of Nordic baking culture.

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.240
And I've come to believe very
firmly that Nordic baking

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.580
culture is actually
the greatest baking

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.210
culture on the planet today in
terms of diversity and depth.

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:49.820
And that might sound
a little bit less

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.980
than obvious for most people.

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.130
And my plan now is that I'm
going to spend the next 30

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.920
minutes or so talking
about, making my case

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.480
for Nordic baking culture.

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:05.930
And then I'll open up for
some question towards the end.

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.880
Do we have a problem?

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:08.737
Sorry, Justin.

00:03:08.737 --> 00:03:09.570
JUSTIN: No, it's OK.

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.040
Go ahead.

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.402
I got this.

00:03:12.402 --> 00:03:13.360
MAGNUS NILSSON: Justin.

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:22.100
So the best place to start
when we talk about culture,

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:23.360
it's the people.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.940
Because without people, we
can't have any culture--

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.920
baking or otherwise.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.620
And the Nordic
region, it's inhabited

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.380
by about 26 million people.

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.690
And they're spread out
over a surface area

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.890
just under 3.5 million
square kilometers.

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:42.440
That can't, by any stretch,
be called particularly densely

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.840
populated.

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.900
We can compare this to,
for example, the whole rest

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.070
of Europe--

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:51.170
without the Nordics--
which would then

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.619
have about 90 people
per square kilometer.

00:03:54.619 --> 00:03:56.660
Gets even more interesting
if you start comparing

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.650
to specific countries.

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.170
Let's say France, for example.

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.360
France has 116 people
per square kilometer.

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.870
Germany-- the most populous
country in Europe--

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.990
has 237 people per
square kilometer.

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:11.860
And as a little example--

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.350
to compare the two--

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.770
if you were to take
all of the Germans

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:18.620
and you spread them
out in an even layer

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.110
across their whole
country, you would end up

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:24.860
having a German every 75
meter in every direction.

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.040
One even layer.

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.040
If you were to do the
same in the Nordic region,

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.760
there would be 375 meters
between each person.

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.010
That's a huge difference.

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.480
So we have this vast
geographical area

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.820
with a very, very
scarce population.

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.610
And if we were to
go back in time,

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.900
let's say a few hundred
years to an era when

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.950
a lot of what we consider our
cultural identity of today

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:57.110
was actually founded, what would
this scarcity of population

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:00.950
actually have meant for the way
that knowledge was transmitted

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:02.930
between people?

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:04.920
Can anyone give me
some examples perhaps?

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.590
What do you think?

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:07.490
What would this mean?

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.030
Think before social media,
television, cell phones,

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:13.460
all of this stuff.

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:17.240
AUDIENCE: Not a lot of
[INAUDIBLE] recipes.

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:18.620
MAGNUS NILSSON: Anyone else?

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:20.300
AUDIENCE: A lot
of word of mouth.

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:23.420
MAGNUS NILSSON: A
lot of word of mouth.

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:28.370
I think that the most
important general observation

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:30.140
about the difference
between now and then

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:34.130
would be that information
knowledge everywhere

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:37.070
would have been transmitted at
a much slower pace back than it

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:38.670
is now.

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:40.140
And, as you say, word of mouth.

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:43.590
You essentially had to talk
face-to-face to a person

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:46.970
to acquire the information
that they might have.

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:48.490
Or you had to write a letter.

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:51.590
And I think that we
can all agree that

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:53.030
writing a physical letter--

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:54.880
although it's a
beautiful thing--

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.810
is not a particularly
efficient way

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:59.900
of sharing lots of
information quickly.

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:01.361
Or the third option--
if you wanted

00:06:01.361 --> 00:06:03.860
to learn from a trusted source--
you could also read a book.

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:07.820
And back then, 300 years ago,
there were like three books.

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:09.770
One was the Bible,
and then there

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:12.110
were two more that didn't
deal with baking either.

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:17.750
So none of these things would
have actually really done much

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:20.480
for the culture of baking.

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:24.350
So if we were to agree, then,
that information flowed slower

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:26.900
everywhere because of
the lack of technology,

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:30.230
I think we can also imagine
that in an area as scarcely

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:33.290
populated as the Nordic region,
this effect would have been

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:37.389
further exaggerated simply
because there is just much more

00:06:37.389 --> 00:06:38.930
distance between
each person that you

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:41.567
can interact with face-to-face.

00:06:41.567 --> 00:06:43.400
And this is very important
for my reasoning,

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.733
and it's something that I
will come back to a little bit

00:06:45.733 --> 00:06:47.125
later.

00:06:47.125 --> 00:06:48.500
Now, I'm going to
make an example

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:50.532
as well to illustrate this.

00:06:50.532 --> 00:06:52.490
So I have my good friend
Johan on here tonight.

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:54.112
He sits there in the back.

00:06:54.112 --> 00:06:55.820
He happened to be in
San Francisco today,

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:58.710
so he just came here
to have a look as well.

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:01.960
And let's say that
Johan tomorrow

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:04.560
would invent a new cake recipe.

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.410
And it's not just
any cake recipe.

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:11.270
It's actually the most delicious
cake recipe ever invented

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:12.770
by humankind.

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:14.591
It's completely revolutionary.

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:19.160
And he would bake
this cake recipe.

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.870
Maybe he would share
it with his family.

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:24.650
And he would do what
most people do today

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:27.470
when they do something
they're proud of,

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:29.270
some kind of achievement.

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:31.100
He would share it
on social media.

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:39.860
And because of this cake and
its extreme deliciousness,

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:42.880
everyone who sees it on social
media, they're a bit excited.

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:45.400
Because he's claiming that he's
made the world's best cake,

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:46.107
right?

00:07:46.107 --> 00:07:48.190
And perhaps a few of them
will ask for the recipe,

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:49.600
and they will do the same thing.

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:51.070
They will also bake it.

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:54.550
And little by little,
information generation

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:58.060
by information generation,
this cake recipe

00:07:58.060 --> 00:07:59.650
spreads out into the world.

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:02.350
And then all of a
sudden, maybe it

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:05.920
hits someone with a bit more
reach, perhaps a couple 100,000

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:06.490
followers.

00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:10.882
And it gets even further out
into the world of information.

00:08:10.882 --> 00:08:13.090
And all of a sudden, it's
featured on "Martha Stewart

00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:16.180
Living," Johan's cake recipe.

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:19.390
And then it takes one more week,
and it's my birthday back home

00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:20.300
in Sweden.

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:21.520
And Tove, my wife--

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:24.430
who has also done a lot
of the recipe development

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:26.170
for these two books--

00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:27.970
she's made a birthday cake.

00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:29.590
But it's not my
normal birthday cake,

00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:31.990
which is the green
marzipan layer

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:34.120
cake, which is the
princess cake, the most

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:36.110
delicious birthday
cake there is, I think.

00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:36.802
No, no.

00:08:36.802 --> 00:08:37.510
It's another one.

00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:38.470
It's a new one.

00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:40.900
But it's not
Johan's cake either.

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:44.440
It's the vegan, raw food
version of Johan's cake

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:48.080
that Tove's gotten from
her goop newsletter.

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:54.220
And that's how information flows
today when it comes to food.

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:55.930
Much, much faster.

00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:59.980
And not only does it spread
more quickly over a large area,

00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:03.830
it also mutates quicker
into new versions of itself.

00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:05.080
And this is a huge difference.

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:07.880
This hasn't been going
on for very long.

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:11.920
And if we were to compare
this with how things were back

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:14.380
a couple of hundred
years ago, Johan

00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:15.930
could still have
invented the cake.

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:19.330
It would have been equally
delicious as it was today.

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:21.010
He would have made
it for his family.

00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:26.050
And then that would
have been it, right?

00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:28.960
And then perhaps
when Johan's kids

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:33.955
were to leave the house after
20 years of eating his cake,

00:09:33.955 --> 00:09:35.830
perhaps they got married
into the neighboring

00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:39.600
farm 800 meters away,
another four people

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:42.590
would have learned
about the cake.

00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:44.290
So in the span of
20 years, it would

00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:47.416
have spread over a
diameter of 2 kilometers,

00:09:47.416 --> 00:09:48.790
and eight people
would have known

00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:50.789
about the cake, the most
delicious cake invented

00:09:50.789 --> 00:09:52.260
by humankind.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.420
And this is a bit of
an over exaggeration,

00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:56.890
but I think that
you get the point.

00:09:56.890 --> 00:10:00.280
And to put this simply,
a scarce population

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:03.610
spread out over a vast
area used to mean--

00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:05.710
and to some extent
still means today--

00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:07.980
that knowledge travels slower.

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:10.180
And this, in its
turn, it will always

00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:13.570
mean that you get a more varied
expression of all commonly

00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:15.220
practiced culture.

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:17.530
This is simply because
people are less

00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:22.780
influenced by each other because
they do less of the same stuff.

00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:25.180
And this is one reason to
why the Nordic region has

00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:27.670
a more diverse baking
culture than almost

00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:31.070
any other region in the world.

00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:34.030
Another reason
for this diversity

00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:38.430
that is also somewhat related
to the scarcity of population--

00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:41.350
and which really influences
the baking culture-- it's

00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:44.660
the bakeries and
their role in society.

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:48.070
And in the Nordics,
baking culture,

00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:51.220
it's not carried primarily
by commercial bakeries,

00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:54.200
but rather by people
in their homes.

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:55.930
And this is not just
something that used

00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:57.920
to be accurate in the past.

00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:01.710
It's also something that
still applies today.

00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:04.480
And this has to
do with geography.

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:09.567
Because what does bakeries
need to sustain themselves?

00:11:09.567 --> 00:11:10.400
AUDIENCE: Customers.

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:11.483
MAGNUS NILSSON: Customers.

00:11:11.483 --> 00:11:12.070
Exactly.

00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:13.861
They're going to need
to have people there.

00:11:13.861 --> 00:11:19.300
And if you have 375 meters to
every person, that's not many.

00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:21.880
And there are definitely
bakeries in the Nordics.

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:23.770
There's always been
bakeries in the Nordics.

00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:25.570
But they're
concentrated in quite

00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:27.640
a small geographical area.

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:31.750
At least they used
to be historically.

00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:33.910
You would have found most
of these bakeries that

00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:37.810
were common enough
to produce bread

00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:40.450
as a daily staple in cities.

00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:42.340
And most of the
cities in the Nordics

00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:44.660
are in the southern
third of Sweden,

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:50.200
a bit on the southwest coast
of Finland, all of Denmark,

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:53.350
and then an area around
Oslo, and a little bit

00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:54.676
up on the west coast of Norway.

00:11:54.676 --> 00:11:56.050
That's where you
would have found

00:11:56.050 --> 00:11:58.390
these cities that were big
enough to sustain bakeries

00:11:58.390 --> 00:11:59.050
in the past.

00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:06.330
And I actually did
a little test when

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:09.330
I did another talk that was on
a completely different subject I

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:10.720
guess some weeks ago.

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:13.500
I had 100 people in the
room, and I asked them

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:16.830
all what they thought
was the greatest baking

00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:18.660
culture on the planet.

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:20.640
None of them said Nordic.

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:22.090
What do you guys
think they said?

00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:22.990
AUDIENCE: France.

00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:23.370
MAGNUS NILSSON: Yeah.

00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:24.360
They said France.

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:26.742
Or 99 of them said
France, and then there

00:12:26.742 --> 00:12:28.200
was this one guy
who said Austrian.

00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:34.060
And I started
thinking about this.

00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:35.740
And I think that
I would have said

00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:40.260
in France as well before
starting with this project.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:45.020
And I started
thinking more about

00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:46.620
why does everyone think this?

00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:50.580
What's the substance behind
this immediate assumption

00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:52.590
from almost every
person you meet

00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:56.410
that the French baking culture
is the greatest on the planet?

00:12:56.410 --> 00:13:00.780
I think that this simply
a case and a great example

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:04.470
of a very, very clever
and successfully executed

00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:07.590
branding exercise by the French.

00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:10.050
You visit France.

00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:11.717
There's baguettes, you buy them.

00:13:11.717 --> 00:13:13.050
There are eclairs, you buy them.

00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:16.290
And then you have a
great time in France.

00:13:16.290 --> 00:13:20.070
And if we start to look at what
French baking culture actually

00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:25.620
is, it's the polar opposite
to what Nordic baking culture

00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:27.230
looks like.

00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:28.480
Have I done something strange?

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:29.021
AUDIENCE: No.

00:13:29.021 --> 00:13:31.272
MAGNUS NILSSON: Oh, good.

00:13:31.272 --> 00:13:35.790
As opposed to ours, the
French baking culture

00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:39.900
is almost entirely driven
by professional bakeries.

00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:42.440
People in France, they don't
bake that much at home.

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:45.012
And I mean, why would they?

00:13:45.012 --> 00:13:48.510
There's a bakery in every
tiny little village in France.

00:13:48.510 --> 00:13:51.450
And France is very evenly
and quite densely populated

00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:52.870
as we said before.

00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:56.190
So there is absolutely
no incentive

00:13:56.190 --> 00:13:59.799
to bake your own bread
on a regular basis,

00:13:59.799 --> 00:14:01.215
so that it becomes
a daily staple.

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:07.680
And if we take this a step
further, and think about what

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:10.440
this actually means
for the culture

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:13.790
of eating and baking bread.

00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:15.990
I imagine that
many in this room--

00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:17.400
perhaps almost all of you--

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:20.310
have been to France, and you
have bought and eaten something

00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:23.520
from a French bakery.

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:25.170
Perhaps you were
there on vacation.

00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:26.669
Perhaps you lived
there for a while.

00:14:26.669 --> 00:14:27.300
I don't know.

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:31.050
But I think that most of us can
agree that French bakeries are

00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:33.240
lovely places.

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:37.160
The baguettes, the butter
croissant, pain au chocolat,

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:40.290
apricot turnovers,
flan, pain croissant.

00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:45.060
All of these things are examples
of great, great pastries

00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:46.360
and bakes.

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:48.270
And I too love a French bakery.

00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:49.620
I used to live there.

00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:51.150
I've been to a lot of them.

00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:53.220
And not just in Paris
where I lived, but all

00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:54.640
over the country.

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:57.600
And when I started thinking
about these things, one thing

00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:02.440
that I realized that they're
pretty much all the same.

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:06.960
They share almost exactly the
same repertoire of baked goods

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:09.830
regardless of where
in France they are.

00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:14.550
And sure, the butter rolled
into a croissant in Brittany

00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:17.100
might be a little bit saltier
than the one outside of Nice.

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:19.217
Perhaps the apricots
are fresh in the south,

00:15:19.217 --> 00:15:20.550
and they're canned in the north.

00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:23.700
And there are definitely
some regional variations

00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:25.980
and some regional
specialties that

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:30.540
are added on to this standard
repertoire across the country.

00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:34.370
But, all in all, they
are remarkably similar.

00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:37.380
And as I said before, in France,
people rarely bake at home.

00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:40.150
And if they do,
they bake dessert.

00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:45.510
Might go to the bakery,
buy a roll of puff pastry,

00:15:45.510 --> 00:15:46.950
and go home and
make tarte tatin.

00:15:46.950 --> 00:15:50.690
That's sort of the extent of it.

00:15:50.690 --> 00:15:54.200
And as you can understand,
this is not exactly

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:58.140
a great growing ground
for cultural individuality

00:15:58.140 --> 00:15:59.750
and diversity.

00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:02.940
And this is because businesses--

00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:04.950
bakeries are businesses.

00:16:04.950 --> 00:16:09.120
And businesses, they have
to function financially.

00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:12.780
And this happens when you find
that sweet spot between what

00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:14.790
people want to buy
and what's actually

00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:19.180
possible to produce in an
efficient enough manner.

00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:22.920
So there is always going to
be-- for all cultures dominated

00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:26.220
by businesses--
certain circumstances

00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:28.440
and rules around
them that will shape

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:30.960
and, to quite a large
degree, streamline

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:32.250
what these places produce.

00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:35.670
And I think that very often with
food, we tend to forget this.

00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:37.010
Because we are so--

00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:38.970
we take food for granted.

00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:43.030
And we don't really see food
as part of normal business,

00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:45.760
even though it is, obviously.

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:49.800
And I think you can make a bit
of an interesting comparison

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:52.440
with, for example, other
types of manufacturing.

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:56.910
Let's say, that you compare
bakeries and car companies.

00:16:56.910 --> 00:16:59.490
So almost all car
companies-- except

00:16:59.490 --> 00:17:02.400
for some cosmetic
differences-- make

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:04.650
essentially the same product.

00:17:04.650 --> 00:17:07.680
Rectangular box,
wheel in each corner,

00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:09.990
it goes either like
that or like that.

00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:13.359
They kind of do the same thing.

00:17:13.359 --> 00:17:17.250
And the same rules apply there,
because they're a business.

00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:20.190
And they collectively
figure out the best way

00:17:20.190 --> 00:17:22.619
of producing something that's
as close as possible to what

00:17:22.619 --> 00:17:23.640
people want to buy.

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:26.190
And it's exactly the
same for the bakeries.

00:17:26.190 --> 00:17:30.090
And also, most bakeries,
they're run by bakers.

00:17:30.090 --> 00:17:32.040
And most bakers
who run bakeries,

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:34.140
they've also gone to
school somewhere where

00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:36.360
they learned how to bake.

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:39.030
Incidentally, they learned how
to bake exactly the same way

00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:41.580
as pretty much all of the
others who also went to school

00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:42.950
and started bakeries.

00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:45.420
And because their
business model works

00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:47.970
and has worked for a long
time, most likely what they're

00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:50.040
going to teach the next
generation of bakers

00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:54.300
is some iteration of what
they are already doing.

00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:57.720
And none of this really
promotes diversity in culture.

00:18:00.770 --> 00:18:02.700
So in a baking culture
driven by bakeries,

00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:05.430
you will inevitably
only have a fraction

00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:08.550
of the diversity found in
a culture that's driven

00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:10.120
by people baking in the home.

00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:14.820
And this is another reason why
there is no more diverse baking

00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:17.730
culture in the world
than in the Nordics.

00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:20.400
And I actually think that
a comparison between the US

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:21.840
and Sweden here
really illustrates

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:25.740
the differences in how much
people actually bake at home.

00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:28.680
Because something that I've
understood here in the US

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:30.330
now when we've done
all of the recipe

00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:33.150
testing with independent
recipe testers in America

00:18:33.150 --> 00:18:36.450
to see that the recipes actually
function and also something

00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:39.982
that I've come to talk a lot
about during this tour when

00:18:39.982 --> 00:18:41.940
we're meeting people and
talking about the book

00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:47.070
is that it's hard to
buy fresh yeast here.

00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:49.380
Essentially, it seems
to me that if you

00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:51.450
want to buy fresh
yeast in America,

00:18:51.450 --> 00:18:54.780
you have to sort of sneak up
in the alley behind some bakery

00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:59.700
and go in the back door and
buy some of their yeast stash.

00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:01.770
Which is very different
from how it would be in,

00:19:01.770 --> 00:19:03.145
for example, Sweden
where you can

00:19:03.145 --> 00:19:05.820
buy fresh yeast in every grocery
store, every petrol station,

00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:06.870
every 7-Eleven.

00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:09.100
Many newsstands will
have fresh yeast.

00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:10.560
That's not just
because they have

00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:13.601
a pretty yellow color-- the
cubes-- and people have them

00:19:13.601 --> 00:19:14.100
for fun.

00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:15.510
It's because people buy them.

00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:18.270
And people buy them because
they want to bake with them.

00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:19.890
And I think that
this illustrates

00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:24.450
how big a part of people's
home cooking baking

00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:27.360
makes out in the Nordic region.

00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:31.080
And then you have
geography and climate.

00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:35.010
Another very important
influence on what people eat.

00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:38.430
And as I said before, the
Nordics, it's a vast region.

00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:40.770
From the southernmost
bits of Denmark,

00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:43.020
all the way up to the
northern parts of Spitsbergen

00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:45.210
islands, north of Norway.

00:19:45.210 --> 00:19:47.730
From Finland in the
east to Greenland

00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:49.000
all the way in the west.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.299
It's a huge region.

00:19:50.299 --> 00:19:51.840
You can fit all of
the rest of Europe

00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:53.730
a whole bunch of times in there.

00:19:53.730 --> 00:19:56.670
I think you can fit the whole
US in there as well easily.

00:19:56.670 --> 00:19:59.590
And sure, a lot
of this is ocean.

00:19:59.590 --> 00:20:01.090
But that doesn't really matter.

00:20:01.090 --> 00:20:04.560
Because when it comes
to cultural diversity,

00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:08.160
dependent on the geography,
the important thing

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:09.780
is not that it's
evenly populated.

00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:12.450
The important thing is the
distance between the extremes

00:20:12.450 --> 00:20:15.330
where people actually live.

00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:20.100
And in terms of climate,
naturally, in such a vast area,

00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:22.500
you will also have
a lot of variation.

00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:25.060
And this, in its
turn, it will mean

00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:27.540
what people have been
able to grow in the past

00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:30.600
and thereby bake with and
integrate into our culture,

00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:33.470
it's varied a lot depending
on where they live.

00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:36.630
And you can think
wheat, for example.

00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:41.430
Wheat is a grain that needs
fairly particular circumstances

00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:42.030
to grow well.

00:20:42.030 --> 00:20:45.840
It needs a long enough
and a warm enough summer.

00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:47.940
It needs quite a lot of water.

00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:52.110
And it needs very fertile
ground to grow well.

00:20:52.110 --> 00:20:54.955
And these circumstances
you won't find everywhere

00:20:54.955 --> 00:20:55.830
in the Nordic region.

00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:59.610
You'll actually find them
pretty much in that same region

00:20:59.610 --> 00:21:03.372
where all of those cities
are located funnily.

00:21:03.372 --> 00:21:04.830
So in the southern
third of Sweden,

00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:07.380
a little bit on the
Finnish west coast,

00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:09.570
a little bit in South
Norway, and all over Denmark.

00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:12.480
That's where wheat was
traditionally grown.

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:15.690
And it's also where most
of the wheat-based recipes

00:21:15.690 --> 00:21:19.530
in traditional Nordic
baking happens to come from.

00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:23.850
And funnily enough, what used
to be practical limitations

00:21:23.850 --> 00:21:26.190
on necessities in the
past tends to inform

00:21:26.190 --> 00:21:29.096
our choices today a lot.

00:21:29.096 --> 00:21:31.470
And you can go on, you can
look at, for example, Denmark.

00:21:31.470 --> 00:21:36.420
So Denmark has the most fertile
farmland in the Nordics.

00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:39.690
It's a great agricultural
production area,

00:21:39.690 --> 00:21:41.850
and they grow a lot of wheat.

00:21:41.850 --> 00:21:45.390
And wheat has always been an
important trade commodity.

00:21:45.390 --> 00:21:46.720
Very expensive.

00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:48.360
So what they used
to do historically

00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:50.760
is that they grew the
wheat on their best land,

00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:53.550
and then they sold it off
to continental Europe.

00:21:53.550 --> 00:21:55.020
Almost all of it.

00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:58.710
And on all of the poorer pieces
of land, instead of wheat,

00:21:58.710 --> 00:21:59.430
they grew rye.

00:21:59.430 --> 00:22:02.940
Because rye, it
ripens very dependably

00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:05.580
every summer in Denmark.

00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:10.940
And they therefore have a
really great rye bread culture.

00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:13.710
And because southern
Sweden is close to Denmark,

00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:16.260
you'll also find a bit
of rye bread there.

00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:18.927
And you'll find in both
Denmark and south Sweden breads

00:22:18.927 --> 00:22:21.510
that you historically wouldn't
have found anywhere else, which

00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:24.750
were breads that had both
rye and wheat in them.

00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:26.880
Unique to this area.

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:28.300
And then you can
look at Finland.

00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:31.560
So Finland has almost all rye.

00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:34.421
Almost no other grains are used
in traditional Finnish baking.

00:22:34.421 --> 00:22:36.045
And this is because
most of the country

00:22:36.045 --> 00:22:37.710
is located too far north.

00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:41.370
So it's too cool in the summer
for the wheat to grow there.

00:22:41.370 --> 00:22:45.840
And then in the southern part,
the warmest part of Finland,

00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:49.459
it has inland climates
towards the Russian border.

00:22:49.459 --> 00:22:51.750
So even if it would have been
warm enough for the wheat

00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:54.125
to grow there and the summer
would have been long enough,

00:22:54.125 --> 00:22:55.380
it's too dry.

00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:56.670
So it doesn't work.

00:22:56.670 --> 00:23:01.750
But rye, it can take a lot
less water during the summer.

00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:05.420
And it informs all of
their baking culture.

00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:08.570
Where I grew up, further
north up in Sweden,

00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:11.630
you can't grow wheat because
it's too cool in the summer.

00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:13.800
You can't grow rye either
for the same reason.

00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:16.520
So people used to
grow oats and barley.

00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:19.040
And oats, it has no
gluten at all in it.

00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:22.170
And barley will have a
little bit of gluten.

00:23:22.170 --> 00:23:24.080
And gluten you need
to make fluffy breads.

00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:27.020
So the further north you come
in Scandinavia, the flatter

00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:30.950
the breads will be until you hit
the point, sort of halfway up

00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:32.550
through Sweden and Norway--

00:23:32.550 --> 00:23:34.670
where I used to grow up--

00:23:34.670 --> 00:23:38.030
where the traditional
bakes would be only

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:39.830
flatbreads either soft or dry.

00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:45.840
And I'm going to
compare this to France

00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:49.020
again, just because it's a
very easy comparison to make.

00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:51.620
So what grains do
we find in France?

00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:54.510
It's wheat everywhere.

00:23:54.510 --> 00:23:57.720
They grow almost
exclusively wheat.

00:23:57.720 --> 00:23:59.700
Why would they
grow anything else?

00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:02.040
Pretty much all of the
country-- except for the warmest

00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:04.620
and driest bits
towards the southeast--

00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:06.300
has a great growing
climate for wheat.

00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:08.610
And wheat is, in Europe,
it has traditionally

00:24:08.610 --> 00:24:12.930
been the most well
paid for grain crop.

00:24:12.930 --> 00:24:17.880
But then you look at the
repertoire of recipes.

00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:21.960
Almost all of the
recipes for both breads

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:24.750
and savory pastries
in France, they're

00:24:24.750 --> 00:24:27.420
based on one single
grain, which is wheat.

00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:30.580
If you look all
over the Nordics,

00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:32.520
we've had four
different grains who've

00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:38.520
all been equally important to
specific parts of the region.

00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:42.000
Meaning that we have four
times as much base material

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.380
to work with.

00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:45.852
Meaning more diversity.

00:24:45.852 --> 00:24:47.310
We can do the
questions afterwards.

00:24:47.310 --> 00:24:48.930
Sorry.

00:24:48.930 --> 00:24:52.650
So these climate and
its limiting factors

00:24:52.650 --> 00:24:55.890
has historically created
a lot of diversity.

00:24:55.890 --> 00:25:00.270
And as I said before, the
Nordic region is also vast.

00:25:00.270 --> 00:25:03.360
But it's a vast region that's
located almost all of it

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:05.430
in the marginal climates.

00:25:05.430 --> 00:25:09.090
And it's marginal in the
sense that for people

00:25:09.090 --> 00:25:12.720
to successfully
live there, you have

00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:14.080
to plan ahead a little bit.

00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:17.640
You can't just expect to
harvest plant-based foods

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:19.230
all throughout the year.

00:25:19.230 --> 00:25:21.300
Which would be the case
in quite a large part

00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:26.340
of the Mediterranean area,
big part of Asia, for example.

00:25:26.340 --> 00:25:28.500
In a lot of warmer
climates in the world,

00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:30.600
you wouldn't really
have any incentive

00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:34.800
to store foods, at least not
for a longer period of time.

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:38.910
And the interesting
thing with all

00:25:38.910 --> 00:25:40.740
of these marginal climates--

00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:43.560
doesn't really matter where
you are in the world--

00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:46.500
they have two product
groups in common

00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:51.860
that have been huge in
historical importance

00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:54.540
and essentially things
that made people lived

00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:56.100
through the harsh winters.

00:25:56.100 --> 00:26:00.470
And those two product groups,
they are grains and dairy.

00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:04.320
And both grains and dairy,
they are not only high energy,

00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:07.680
but they're also very easily
produced in large quantities

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:10.050
during fairly cool summers.

00:26:10.050 --> 00:26:13.440
And on top of that,
both grains and dairy,

00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:16.680
they are easily
prepared for storage.

00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:19.500
With dairy, you can think
cultured dairy products--

00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:21.360
butter, cheese--

00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:23.700
all things that
keep really well.

00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:25.660
And all things that are
very dense in energy,

00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:28.710
so they don't take up
a lot of storage space

00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:30.630
when you keep them.

00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:34.470
For the cereals, all
seeds of perennial grasses

00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:36.030
make great storage crop.

00:26:36.030 --> 00:26:38.520
They dry well, they
store well, and they

00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:40.660
can be turned into a
lot of different things.

00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:45.480
And it doesn't matter, if
you're in the Peruvian Andes,

00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:48.000
if you're in a monastery
in Bhutan in the Himalayas,

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.990
or if you're in a suburb of
Ostersund, where I grew up.

00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:57.210
It doesn't matter if it's
corn or red rice or wheat.

00:26:57.210 --> 00:27:01.770
Or if it's milk from
a llama or yak or cow.

00:27:01.770 --> 00:27:03.810
The same sort of
basic principles

00:27:03.810 --> 00:27:07.950
apply over all of these
marginal climates.

00:27:07.950 --> 00:27:10.590
And I think that baking--

00:27:10.590 --> 00:27:12.090
which I thought was
going to be very

00:27:12.090 --> 00:27:13.220
easy to define what baking is.

00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:15.260
It turns out that it's
not easy to define at all.

00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:16.634
And I think that
baking is simply

00:27:16.634 --> 00:27:18.900
like a catchall phrase
for all of the ways

00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:24.360
that humankind can turn grains
sometimes in combination

00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:28.430
with dairy into food.

00:27:28.430 --> 00:27:32.580
How we can turn these two basic
product groups into something

00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:36.270
that's more easily digestible,
more tasty, and more

00:27:36.270 --> 00:27:40.794
varied than the products
are on their own.

00:27:40.794 --> 00:27:42.960
And I think that the fact
that we've created so much

00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:47.400
variation with such a limited
number of base products

00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:50.220
as we have in baking
compared to savory food.

00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:51.250
Just imagine.

00:27:51.250 --> 00:27:55.170
Almost all baking recipes, they
contain the same five things

00:27:55.170 --> 00:27:56.730
in different variations.

00:27:56.730 --> 00:27:58.680
And if you look at
the savory cooking,

00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:01.170
you have thousands of
different base products

00:28:01.170 --> 00:28:03.870
that becomes various
combinations.

00:28:03.870 --> 00:28:06.720
And I think that this
great diversity in number

00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:08.820
of recipes and
expressions in baking,

00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:13.170
it really says a lot
about how important

00:28:13.170 --> 00:28:16.620
and how big a part of our
daily caloric intake that used

00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:18.040
to come from grains and dairy.

00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:20.906
We were really, really motivated
to create a lot of diversity

00:28:20.906 --> 00:28:21.405
in recipes.

00:28:24.030 --> 00:28:28.080
Today, we often tell
ourselves that we decide

00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:29.580
what we eat all the time.

00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:32.790
That no one else dictates
what products we buy

00:28:32.790 --> 00:28:34.410
and what we make from them.

00:28:34.410 --> 00:28:37.200
From my perspective, this is
obviously completely wrong.

00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:39.700
Because we are animals.

00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:42.050
We do exactly what our
species has always done.

00:28:42.050 --> 00:28:45.180
We procure whatever products
that make sense to us

00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:46.260
there and then.

00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:49.620
And we prepare them in whatever
way that makes sense to us

00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:50.250
there and then.

00:28:50.250 --> 00:28:54.060
And then we eat them
ourselves or with our flock.

00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:56.250
That's what we do.

00:28:56.250 --> 00:29:00.060
And the thing though that
fascinates me so much with

00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:02.310
this-- especially when
it comes to baking--

00:29:02.310 --> 00:29:04.950
it's the amount of
cultural knowledge

00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:08.790
that's transmitted
between generations.

00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:11.910
Because eating correctly
grown, preserved, stored,

00:29:11.910 --> 00:29:15.720
and subsequently prepared foods
made from grains and dairy,

00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:20.190
it used to be incredibly
important for our ancestors.

00:29:20.190 --> 00:29:22.600
For them, it was
simply about survival,

00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:25.980
which is the single strongest
motivating force of the human

00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:27.360
being.

00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:31.877
Today, for almost all of
us, eating breads and cakes

00:29:31.877 --> 00:29:33.960
and buns and cookies or
whatever else we've baked,

00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:35.084
it's mostly about pleasure.

00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:40.952
And why do we find
it so pleasurable?

00:29:40.952 --> 00:29:44.250
And the easy explanation
here is that these items are

00:29:44.250 --> 00:29:48.030
dense in energy and that we
are predisposed to like things

00:29:48.030 --> 00:29:49.530
that are dense in energy.

00:29:49.530 --> 00:29:54.030
And that might explain why
we find a piece of cookie

00:29:54.030 --> 00:29:54.840
very tasty.

00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:59.040
But it doesn't explain why
we're so motivated to pass

00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:01.170
on this cultural information
between generations

00:30:01.170 --> 00:30:03.660
and why it's so
pleasurable to bake.

00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:07.680
And I think that's simply our--

00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:12.690
humankind's-- function
put in place by humankind

00:30:12.690 --> 00:30:16.170
in our subconscious minds to
make sure that we don't lose

00:30:16.170 --> 00:30:18.881
this information just because
there's a new generation

00:30:18.881 --> 00:30:19.380
coming.

00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:25.440
Almost everyone I know
take more pleasure

00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:27.014
and they feel more
satisfied when

00:30:27.014 --> 00:30:29.430
they've baked something than
when they've cooked something

00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:30.600
savory.

00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:34.440
Personally, I'm more happy when
I bake a sponge cake than when

00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:37.100
I make an oven omelet.

00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:40.980
And I think this is just
a really good indicator

00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:44.460
on how our minds function.

00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:50.080
And this sort of boils
down to my final big reason

00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:54.760
to why the Nordic baking culture
truly is the greatest around.

00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:57.820
Preparing all of these
grains and dairy products,

00:30:57.820 --> 00:31:00.010
well, it used to be
more important where

00:31:00.010 --> 00:31:03.350
I come from than in almost
any other part of the world.

00:31:03.350 --> 00:31:05.770
And I think this is
also the reason why

00:31:05.770 --> 00:31:10.030
most people in the Nordics
still bake more in their homes

00:31:10.030 --> 00:31:11.900
than people do in other
parts of the world.

00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:13.390
We just take more
pleasure in it,

00:31:13.390 --> 00:31:16.960
because it used to be more
important for us in the past.

00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:23.110
And as with all culture, if
culture is regularly practiced

00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:28.960
on an everyday basis, if culture
is allowed to change gradually

00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:33.160
because of use, it will always
be more diverse and deeply

00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:37.120
rooted than if it's carried
out by just a few people

00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:40.220
or kept in tact in a bubble.

00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:44.710
And I think this is the final
reason from my side to why

00:31:44.710 --> 00:31:46.090
the Nordic baking
culture is just

00:31:46.090 --> 00:31:49.310
the most diverse baking
culture on the planet today.

00:31:49.310 --> 00:31:50.516
Thank you.

00:31:50.516 --> 00:31:53.444
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:58.820 --> 00:32:01.180
And now we can do questions.

00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:03.390
Do we have a mic or yeah.

00:32:03.390 --> 00:32:04.130
Cool.

00:32:04.130 --> 00:32:06.220
And it can be
questions about this,

00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:07.900
about the project
with these books.

00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:09.800
It can be questions about
Faviken and my restaurant.

00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:11.925
It can be questions about
anything you want really.

00:32:11.925 --> 00:32:13.900
So raise some hands.

00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:15.940
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
that during the process

00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:20.410
for researching this entire
project that you thought

00:32:20.410 --> 00:32:22.894
at the beginning you knew a
lot about certain Nordic food

00:32:22.894 --> 00:32:24.310
culture and Nordic
baking culture,

00:32:24.310 --> 00:32:27.340
but you found that you knew
a lot less than you did.

00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:30.160
What are some examples of some
particularly interesting things

00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:31.660
that you learned?

00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:34.150
MAGNUS NILSSON: For me,
the most interesting

00:32:34.150 --> 00:32:37.750
I learned was actually how much
diversity there is out there.

00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:40.840
Because, first of all,
there's no such thing

00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:43.120
as a common Nordic identity.

00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:43.900
I don't know.

00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:45.691
There are some Nordic
people here for sure.

00:32:45.691 --> 00:32:47.680
There might be more,
but I think all

00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:49.210
of us living in
the Nordic region,

00:32:49.210 --> 00:32:53.560
we feel a strong identity
connected to where we're from.

00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:56.590
But that's usually not like,
hey, I'm Nordic, you know?

00:32:56.590 --> 00:32:57.550
I'm Swedish.

00:32:57.550 --> 00:33:00.400
And I think that because
of this, we might not

00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:08.197
have been receptive to
our neighboring cultures

00:33:08.197 --> 00:33:09.280
as much as we should have.

00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:11.830
At least that applies to me.

00:33:11.830 --> 00:33:16.540
I guess traveling around,
meeting people in their homes,

00:33:16.540 --> 00:33:19.270
talking about food, seeing what
they actually cook and bake

00:33:19.270 --> 00:33:21.640
on an everyday
basis, it's just been

00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:25.190
eye opening how much difference
in cultural diversity

00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:27.147
is out there.

00:33:27.147 --> 00:33:29.730
AUDIENCE: What's the difference
in bread between hand kneading

00:33:29.730 --> 00:33:33.010
it and using a KitchenAid?

00:33:33.010 --> 00:33:36.400
MAGNUS NILSSON: The
KitchenAid specifically, it's

00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:38.410
one way of machine kneading.

00:33:38.410 --> 00:33:41.372
But it has a
specific expression,

00:33:41.372 --> 00:33:43.580
because of the size of the
bowl and the way it moves.

00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:47.470
But I think that if we just
look at machine processed versus

00:33:47.470 --> 00:33:52.610
hand processed, theoretically,
there has to be no difference.

00:33:52.610 --> 00:33:55.900
Doesn't have to
be any difference.

00:33:55.900 --> 00:33:58.584
Because the dough doesn't
know what's going on to it.

00:33:58.584 --> 00:34:00.250
And there is a lot
of different machines

00:34:00.250 --> 00:34:01.090
that can take care of this.

00:34:01.090 --> 00:34:02.140
And this is something
that I've spoken

00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:03.181
to a lot of bakers about.

00:34:03.181 --> 00:34:06.100
And very begrudgingly,
most of them

00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:08.620
agree that a machine should
be able to do exactly

00:34:08.620 --> 00:34:10.250
as well as a human being.

00:34:10.250 --> 00:34:13.030
But then there are other
parts of the baking process

00:34:13.030 --> 00:34:15.670
that machines, at
least not yet, are

00:34:15.670 --> 00:34:17.602
able to replicate perfectly.

00:34:17.602 --> 00:34:19.060
AUDIENCE: In your
research, did you

00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:22.870
find any regional difference
between the different grains

00:34:22.870 --> 00:34:24.394
depending on where
they're grown?

00:34:24.394 --> 00:34:26.560
I'm thinking about all the
different kinds of wheats

00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:27.586
there are.

00:34:27.586 --> 00:34:30.130
What about different
kinds of rye,

00:34:30.130 --> 00:34:33.880
for instance, different corn
coming from different parts.

00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:36.060
Or is it all just so
mixed in the processing

00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:37.830
we don't really know?

00:34:37.830 --> 00:34:40.330
MAGNUS NILSSON: The thing is
that, if you look further back,

00:34:40.330 --> 00:34:42.070
there was more
regional diversity.

00:34:42.070 --> 00:34:44.889
When farmers would take
and produce their own seed

00:34:44.889 --> 00:34:47.739
from their crop and then
reseed that next year,

00:34:47.739 --> 00:34:51.310
you would have a larger
degree of genetic diversity

00:34:51.310 --> 00:34:54.670
in whatever was produced
in various regions.

00:34:54.670 --> 00:34:55.900
Not just grains.

00:34:55.900 --> 00:35:02.080
But today-- for the
last 100 plus years--

00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:03.880
pretty much all of
the commercial growers

00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:10.330
of [INAUDIBLE] crops use the
same handful of varieties.

00:35:10.330 --> 00:35:14.350
And in this book, it's about--
this documentary [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:14.350 --> 00:35:17.630
about what people
bake today at home.

00:35:17.630 --> 00:35:19.600
Meaning that most
of the research

00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:24.160
has also been into what people
use at home, which is largely

00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:25.995
the same types of flour.

00:35:25.995 --> 00:35:27.370
AUDIENCE: I just
thought it would

00:35:27.370 --> 00:35:29.910
be interesting to have
terroir of difference.

00:35:29.910 --> 00:35:31.150
MAGNUS NILSSON: It will be
very interesting to have

00:35:31.150 --> 00:35:33.608
terroir of different grains,
but it's actually nonexistent.

00:35:33.608 --> 00:35:34.852
[LAUGHS]

00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:38.110
We buy, for example,
to Faviken, we

00:35:38.110 --> 00:35:41.470
buy specific varieties
of various grains

00:35:41.470 --> 00:35:43.330
from specific farms,
and we use that.

00:35:43.330 --> 00:35:47.560
But that's a very extreme
expression of baking.

00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:49.900
That's not at all
representative of what

00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:51.400
people bake in the home.

00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:54.310
And I think that we
will most likely never

00:35:54.310 --> 00:35:56.770
have that type of
variety in the home just

00:35:56.770 --> 00:35:59.250
for practical reasons.

00:35:59.250 --> 00:36:02.680
And then whether that's
sad or whether it's

00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:04.870
efficient and good, I
mean, that's up to anyone.

00:36:04.870 --> 00:36:09.310
And for me, a big part
of making this book

00:36:09.310 --> 00:36:11.500
has also been to
remove my opinions

00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:13.834
from the content matter, which
is not easy all the time.

00:36:13.834 --> 00:36:15.791
Because when you run a
restaurant like Faviken,

00:36:15.791 --> 00:36:18.160
and it's all about pushing
your agenda and your opinion

00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:19.780
and showcasing that in the food.

00:36:19.780 --> 00:36:22.600
But for it to be documentary and
representative for the region,

00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:23.774
I had to remove that.

00:36:23.774 --> 00:36:26.190
AUDIENCE: What do you consider
a therapeutic dish to make?

00:36:28.870 --> 00:36:31.720
MAGNUS NILSSON:
Therapeutic dish to make.

00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:33.700
I think that the
pretty much all baking

00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:35.110
can be fairly therapeutic.

00:36:35.110 --> 00:36:38.680
I like making chocolate oatmeal
balls, which is essentially

00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:41.290
butter, and sugar, and
oatmeal, and cocoa powder.

00:36:41.290 --> 00:36:44.500
And very rarely does it ever
make it to the ball stage.

00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:49.720
Usually, it sort of just
disappears meanwhile.

00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:53.380
AUDIENCE: You mentioned earlier
talking about the fresh yeast.

00:36:53.380 --> 00:36:55.240
I've definitely found
it very frustrating

00:36:55.240 --> 00:36:57.790
following Nordic recipes
because the expectations

00:36:57.790 --> 00:37:01.520
of a convention oven and
fresh yeast and [INAUDIBLE]..

00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:04.130
You mentioned that you did
some testing in America.

00:37:04.130 --> 00:37:06.440
What changes did you
find that you had to make

00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:09.046
or how did you acknowledge
these differences in your books?

00:37:09.046 --> 00:37:09.920
MAGNUS NILSSON: Yeah.

00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:11.480
So it's actually, it's
a bit complicated.

00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:13.280
Because as I said, it's
a documentary book,

00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:17.690
and none of the recipes
have been adapted in any way

00:37:17.690 --> 00:37:21.650
not to better fit
specific territories.

00:37:21.650 --> 00:37:24.380
Or even if I've seen a lot
of recipes where I'm like,

00:37:24.380 --> 00:37:27.020
I can do that so much better
if I change it a little bit.

00:37:27.020 --> 00:37:28.192
But I haven't done that.

00:37:28.192 --> 00:37:29.400
And the same thing goes here.

00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:31.025
So what I've done,
though, is that I've

00:37:31.025 --> 00:37:33.950
written narrative text,
and I provided information

00:37:33.950 --> 00:37:35.690
on some of these topics.

00:37:35.690 --> 00:37:37.940
Like I've written how yeast
functions, for example,

00:37:37.940 --> 00:37:40.604
and what the differences would
be between fresh and dry yeast.

00:37:40.604 --> 00:37:42.770
And I've explained a little
bit in how to substitute

00:37:42.770 --> 00:37:43.853
and how to work with that.

00:37:43.853 --> 00:37:47.270
I've written about the
variation in different flours,

00:37:47.270 --> 00:37:49.160
because there's a huge
difference in flours

00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:50.947
across the world, not
just between America

00:37:50.947 --> 00:37:52.280
and other parts, but everywhere.

00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:54.279
And even within the US,
there's a big difference

00:37:54.279 --> 00:37:56.060
in how flour behaves.

00:37:56.060 --> 00:37:58.010
And then there is
also other recipes.

00:37:58.010 --> 00:37:59.850
What to do if you
don't have a giant wood

00:37:59.850 --> 00:38:01.683
fired brick oven, for
example, when you make

00:38:01.683 --> 00:38:04.054
flatbreads and stuff like that.

00:38:04.054 --> 00:38:04.970
But it is documentary.

00:38:04.970 --> 00:38:07.220
And the recipes, as
such, they are exactly

00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:08.962
as they are in
the Nordic region.

00:38:08.962 --> 00:38:10.670
AUDIENCE: I'm really
curious to hear more

00:38:10.670 --> 00:38:15.470
about the interaction of
identity and nationality.

00:38:15.470 --> 00:38:20.000
Do you think it's the
case that there hasn't

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:23.390
been this identity
of a food culture,

00:38:23.390 --> 00:38:25.930
because there's so much
regional diversity?

00:38:25.930 --> 00:38:27.990
And then also, on
the other side,

00:38:27.990 --> 00:38:32.992
your books are branding
this idea of Nordic cuisine.

00:38:32.992 --> 00:38:34.950
Do you think there is a
broader Nordic identity

00:38:34.950 --> 00:38:37.400
that even though the national
identity that is emerging

00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:38.929
or that you would like to see?

00:38:38.929 --> 00:38:40.970
MAGNUS NILSSON: I think
it has always been there.

00:38:40.970 --> 00:38:43.400
It's just that us
living there, we

00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:46.640
don't like to acknowledge it,
because we feel more strongly

00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:49.100
for our specific
national identity rather

00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:51.810
than a common Nordic one.

00:38:51.810 --> 00:38:54.200
And the Nordic region,
it's a geographical region.

00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:56.670
It's not a cultural region.

00:38:56.670 --> 00:38:59.780
But there are a lot of
things that bind us together

00:38:59.780 --> 00:39:01.850
culturally as well.

00:39:01.850 --> 00:39:04.724
But there are equally many
things that tear us apart.

00:39:04.724 --> 00:39:06.140
And one interesting
thing that you

00:39:06.140 --> 00:39:08.780
can see when it comes
to the way people

00:39:08.780 --> 00:39:10.490
used to cook and
still cooks today--

00:39:10.490 --> 00:39:12.110
and bake as well,
for that matter--

00:39:12.110 --> 00:39:18.170
is that at the base, you have
these climatic and geographical

00:39:18.170 --> 00:39:19.130
differences.

00:39:19.130 --> 00:39:20.270
That's a constant.

00:39:20.270 --> 00:39:21.530
That's just there.

00:39:21.530 --> 00:39:25.160
And then on top of that, you
have a cultural layer as well,

00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:27.110
like a little
cultural filter that

00:39:27.110 --> 00:39:30.920
informs what people do
with these geographical

00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:32.240
circumstances.

00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:35.960
And most of that, I
would say, it actually

00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:39.766
depends on who occupied
whom in the past.

00:39:39.766 --> 00:39:42.140
Which is sort of strange and
a bit interesting and funny.

00:39:42.140 --> 00:39:45.440
But you can divide
the Nordic region

00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:47.060
into two cultural regions--

00:39:47.060 --> 00:39:48.590
one that's Swedish influenced.

00:39:48.590 --> 00:39:51.380
And that's like from
Sweden and then Finland

00:39:51.380 --> 00:39:53.180
and around the Baltics.

00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:54.680
All the Baltic
countries and Poland,

00:39:54.680 --> 00:39:56.390
they're not part of
the Nordics anymore.

00:39:56.390 --> 00:39:59.900
But they have a very
distinctive Swedish influence

00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:03.020
on that cultural layer
on top of the geography.

00:40:03.020 --> 00:40:05.410
And then the western
bit would have the same

00:40:05.410 --> 00:40:07.190
with Danish influence.

00:40:07.190 --> 00:40:08.120
And it really shows.

00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:10.710
Because in that cultural
region, for example,

00:40:10.710 --> 00:40:14.100
you have Greenland, the
Faroe Islands, and Iceland.

00:40:14.100 --> 00:40:16.350
Greenland and Faroe Islands
are still part of Denmark.

00:40:16.350 --> 00:40:19.730
Iceland was occupied by
Denmark for many, many years.

00:40:19.730 --> 00:40:24.410
None of these islands would
have ever seen any grain

00:40:24.410 --> 00:40:26.900
before the Danes came.

00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:31.290
Because the climate doesn't
really support growing grains,

00:40:31.290 --> 00:40:34.520
and they're just so isolated.

00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:37.220
But today, they have
a bread culture.

00:40:37.220 --> 00:40:39.080
And you can trace
almost all of it

00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:41.086
back to the Danish
cultural influence.

00:40:41.086 --> 00:40:43.460
All of these countries, they
would have their own version

00:40:43.460 --> 00:40:47.090
of, for example, the very
iconic Danish rye bread,

00:40:47.090 --> 00:40:49.760
but made to suit
their circumstances.

00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:52.320
On Iceland, for
example, the country

00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:56.390
that has almost no trees,
the source of energy

00:40:56.390 --> 00:40:58.880
to heat the home
was traditionally

00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:02.540
peat moss that was
dug out of a peat bog,

00:41:02.540 --> 00:41:04.610
and lugged home, and
dried, and then burnt.

00:41:04.610 --> 00:41:08.180
And obviously, a very laborious
process to create fuel.

00:41:08.180 --> 00:41:10.430
Meaning that people
weren't exactly inclined

00:41:10.430 --> 00:41:14.520
to fire up a giant brick
oven to bake a loaf of bread.

00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:16.870
So before the Danes
came there, they

00:41:16.870 --> 00:41:20.260
didn't really have any
type of baked goods at all.

00:41:20.260 --> 00:41:22.790
With the Danes came
people from Denmark

00:41:22.790 --> 00:41:27.290
who obviously lived on Iceland,
because it was occupied,

00:41:27.290 --> 00:41:28.820
managing everything.

00:41:28.820 --> 00:41:30.020
They wanted their bread.

00:41:30.020 --> 00:41:32.690
And Iceland has a lot
of volcanic activity.

00:41:32.690 --> 00:41:34.760
So what people did
instead was just

00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:37.460
dig holes in the ground
outside of the villages

00:41:37.460 --> 00:41:40.906
and lower a bucket of rye
bread down into the hole,

00:41:40.906 --> 00:41:42.530
come back the day
after in the morning,

00:41:42.530 --> 00:41:44.480
and pick up a loaf
of steamed bread.

00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:46.180
And that still goes on today.

00:41:46.180 --> 00:41:48.409
And it is very easy to think,
when you're in Iceland,

00:41:48.409 --> 00:41:50.450
oh, they've been doing
this for a thousand years.

00:41:50.450 --> 00:41:51.790
But they haven't.

00:41:51.790 --> 00:41:53.540
They've been doing it
for 200 years, which

00:41:53.540 --> 00:41:56.554
is not very long in a
historical perspective.

00:41:56.554 --> 00:41:57.470
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:57.470 --> 00:42:00.635
What is your favorite
recipe in this book?

00:42:00.635 --> 00:42:02.510
MAGNUS NILSSON: As I
said before, it's been--

00:42:02.510 --> 00:42:04.790
most the process has been
about me not imposing

00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:09.820
too much of my opinion
on the content matter.

00:42:09.820 --> 00:42:14.510
And the choice of recipes, it's
entirely independent on what

00:42:14.510 --> 00:42:16.280
I think is good and bad.

00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:19.040
It's about what represents
the most people in the region

00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:22.320
and the most parts of the
regions as well as possible.

00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:24.470
But then naturally,
there are recipes that--

00:42:24.470 --> 00:42:25.880
for various reasons--

00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:27.609
I personally feel more for.

00:42:27.609 --> 00:42:29.150
And that will probably
be things that

00:42:29.150 --> 00:42:31.910
has to do with my childhood
like soft Swedish flatbreads,

00:42:31.910 --> 00:42:32.500
for example.

00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:34.870
The chocolate balls
I mentioned earlier.

00:42:34.870 --> 00:42:37.370
And then things I didn't know
existed like the Icelandic rye

00:42:37.370 --> 00:42:39.350
bread is also, to
me, very appealing.

00:42:39.350 --> 00:42:41.190
Even if I've never
baked it myself,

00:42:41.190 --> 00:42:44.240
just the fact that it exists.

00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:45.980
AUDIENCE: I have a
question about flours,

00:42:45.980 --> 00:42:48.880
and if you just had a
recommendation for resources

00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:52.130
for the non-professional or the
non-culinary school educated

00:42:52.130 --> 00:42:53.000
person.

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:53.676
I love baking.

00:42:53.676 --> 00:42:55.550
And historically, I've
always been interested

00:42:55.550 --> 00:42:57.890
in alternative flours, and
now I'm really interested

00:42:57.890 --> 00:42:58.880
more in wheat flours.

00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:01.460
But just the variations of
wheat flours and understanding

00:43:01.460 --> 00:43:04.490
the protein content and
how they all interact

00:43:04.490 --> 00:43:05.870
and what brands to buy.

00:43:05.870 --> 00:43:07.442
Simple things like that.

00:43:07.442 --> 00:43:09.650
I find myself traveling to
a million different places

00:43:09.650 --> 00:43:11.895
on the internet and
Googling things.

00:43:14.750 --> 00:43:16.530
And I don't know what's right.

00:43:16.530 --> 00:43:18.770
And I'm just wondering if
there's a central resource

00:43:18.770 --> 00:43:20.353
that you would tell
somebody to go to,

00:43:20.353 --> 00:43:21.800
this is a good
education on flour.

00:43:23.766 --> 00:43:25.640
MAGNUS NILSSON: I don't
have one specific one

00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:27.440
that's available here.

00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:32.310
And what I do know is that there
is a huge amount of difference.

00:43:32.310 --> 00:43:35.540
Not just in what grains
that are used to make flour,

00:43:35.540 --> 00:43:37.550
but also in the
various processes used.

00:43:37.550 --> 00:43:40.520
How things are milled,
how things are aged,

00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:42.410
how they are
transported, and so on.

00:43:42.410 --> 00:43:44.419
And it all affects how
they bake in the end.

00:43:44.419 --> 00:43:46.460
So I think that the only
thing that I can suggest

00:43:46.460 --> 00:43:51.920
is try buying a flour
that seems to be good.

00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:53.420
Because there are
many other reasons

00:43:53.420 --> 00:43:54.800
than just pure functionality.

00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:56.060
Might be that it's organic.

00:43:56.060 --> 00:43:58.440
That it's milled close to
where you live, whatever.

00:43:58.440 --> 00:44:04.330
Buy that and then use only that
until you learn how it behaves.

00:44:04.330 --> 00:44:08.970
And then you'll be able to
adapt recipes into that.

00:44:08.970 --> 00:44:10.970
It's very hard to be
general about these things,

00:44:10.970 --> 00:44:13.310
because they differ so much.

00:44:13.310 --> 00:44:14.750
And there are no--

00:44:14.750 --> 00:44:17.200
I haven't found any
great books on this.

00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:19.430
There's lots of research papers.

00:44:19.430 --> 00:44:21.200
You can go into
university search engines,

00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:25.160
and you can look for things and
read people's crappy abstracts

00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:28.290
about wheat kernels
and things like that.

00:44:28.290 --> 00:44:30.440
And it is very interesting.

00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:32.569
But maybe someone
should write that book.

00:44:32.569 --> 00:44:33.110
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:44:33.110 --> 00:44:37.165
You just defined earlier
baking as the transformation

00:44:37.165 --> 00:44:39.070
of grains.

00:44:39.070 --> 00:44:42.886
And my family is of
Norwegian origination

00:44:42.886 --> 00:44:44.870
though we've been
here for awhile.

00:44:44.870 --> 00:44:48.842
[INAUDIBLE],, lefse,
which is from potato.

00:44:48.842 --> 00:44:51.050
MAGNUS NILSSON: But never
[? yes ?] to potato, right?

00:44:51.050 --> 00:44:51.400
AUDIENCE: What?

00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:53.025
MAGNUS NILSSON: Never
[? yes ?] potato.

00:44:53.025 --> 00:44:54.660
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:44:54.660 --> 00:44:56.150
Does that fit in
your definition?

00:44:56.150 --> 00:44:56.710
MAGNUS NILSSON: It does.

00:44:56.710 --> 00:44:57.622
AUDIENCE: And can you
tell me anything--

00:44:57.622 --> 00:44:58.990
I don't know anything about it.

00:44:58.990 --> 00:45:03.430
MAGNUS NILSSON: So lefse is
the traditional Norwegian

00:45:03.430 --> 00:45:04.270
flatbread.

00:45:04.270 --> 00:45:05.770
And the big difference
between lefse

00:45:05.770 --> 00:45:08.860
and most of the other
flatbreads in the Nordic region

00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:10.360
is that they are griddled.

00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:12.190
They're not baked in an oven.

00:45:12.190 --> 00:45:16.390
And they also use other--

00:45:16.390 --> 00:45:18.160
it's not just flour
base, as you say.

00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:20.710
Quite a few of them
have potato in them.

00:45:20.710 --> 00:45:23.680
A lot of them have peas in them
as well and things like that.

00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:26.440
And the reason why
they're not oven baked

00:45:26.440 --> 00:45:30.340
is that most of Norway, it's a
bit like Iceland in the sense

00:45:30.340 --> 00:45:33.970
that there are not any
large, deep forests.

00:45:33.970 --> 00:45:35.339
Most of the country.

00:45:35.339 --> 00:45:37.130
And that's compared to
Sweden, for example,

00:45:37.130 --> 00:45:42.610
where the generation of my
grand-grandparents, they

00:45:42.610 --> 00:45:44.890
all had 1,000 hectares
of pine forest

00:45:44.890 --> 00:45:47.122
that was pretty much worthless.

00:45:47.122 --> 00:45:48.580
All that was good
for was firewood.

00:45:48.580 --> 00:45:49.640
So they had a lot of that.

00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:51.056
And therefore, we
have a tradition

00:45:51.056 --> 00:45:52.979
of these great big brick ovens.

00:45:52.979 --> 00:45:54.520
On every farm, there
is one of those.

00:45:54.520 --> 00:45:56.620
So all of our flatbreads
are baked in that.

00:45:56.620 --> 00:45:58.930
Norway, they didn't have
access to fuel in that way,

00:45:58.930 --> 00:46:02.040
so they had to be
more energy efficient.

00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:04.720
And a little fire
under a griddle.

00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:08.910
It's a much more efficient
way of baking flatbreads.

00:46:08.910 --> 00:46:10.120
So I think, yeah.

00:46:10.120 --> 00:46:12.550
AUDIENCE: In your
research, you try to,

00:46:12.550 --> 00:46:14.620
like you said, not alter
any of these recipes.

00:46:14.620 --> 00:46:17.890
Are there any recipes or
breads made in very far

00:46:17.890 --> 00:46:21.160
off regions that you're worried
about [INAUDIBLE] die out

00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:23.892
or anything that you want
to do to preserve them?

00:46:23.892 --> 00:46:25.600
MAGNUS NILSSON: So
this is also something

00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:28.660
that I realized
during this process.

00:46:28.660 --> 00:46:33.880
And before this, I think that
I was more on the opinion

00:46:33.880 --> 00:46:38.110
that traditional food
culture is very important

00:46:38.110 --> 00:46:40.392
to preserve as it is.

00:46:40.392 --> 00:46:42.850
And I've come to realize more
and more that it's actually--

00:46:42.850 --> 00:46:44.230
that's completely wrong.

00:46:44.230 --> 00:46:46.330
Because food culture has
to be allowed to evolve,

00:46:46.330 --> 00:46:49.690
and we will always
eat what makes sense

00:46:49.690 --> 00:46:53.530
to us, wherever we
are, whoever we are,

00:46:53.530 --> 00:46:56.440
and whatever time it will be.

00:46:56.440 --> 00:47:00.550
What's important, though, is
to preserve the knowledge.

00:47:00.550 --> 00:47:03.640
To make sure that food
culture is properly

00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:05.360
and accurately documented.

00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:07.120
Because it's a
waste of knowledge

00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:10.012
if it just stops being
practiced and then everyone else

00:47:10.012 --> 00:47:10.720
forgets about it.

00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:13.960
It might have taken generations
or thousands of years

00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:17.290
of empirical study
and living to come up

00:47:17.290 --> 00:47:19.645
with a lot of these techniques.

00:47:19.645 --> 00:47:21.760
And this is a hard
thing actually,

00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:27.609
because almost everyone doesn't
quite agree with me on this.

00:47:27.609 --> 00:47:29.650
Almost everyone, I think,
often without thinking,

00:47:29.650 --> 00:47:32.889
just assess that
these traditions

00:47:32.889 --> 00:47:34.180
are so important to keep alive.

00:47:34.180 --> 00:47:36.564
But who's going to
keep them alive?

00:47:36.564 --> 00:47:38.480
In Sweden, we have sour
herring, for example--

00:47:38.480 --> 00:47:41.830
the stinkiest food
on planet Earth.

00:47:41.830 --> 00:47:45.370
And I think that
wait 30 more years,

00:47:45.370 --> 00:47:47.560
and it's going to be gone.

00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:50.960
And I'm not going to be
sorry that it is gone.

00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:53.890
But I would be very sorry if
the knowledge on how to make it

00:47:53.890 --> 00:47:57.760
would disappear, yes, because
we don't eat it anymore.

00:47:57.760 --> 00:48:00.010
AUDIENCE: I'm also from Sweden.

00:48:00.010 --> 00:48:01.660
MAGNUS NILSSON: Hello.

00:48:01.660 --> 00:48:03.520
AUDIENCE: It seems
to me what you

00:48:03.520 --> 00:48:06.490
said about baking applies to
a lot of other foods as well.

00:48:06.490 --> 00:48:12.150
So my experience is a lot of us
eat home cooked food every day.

00:48:12.150 --> 00:48:15.055
And I haven't seen that to the
same extent in other places

00:48:15.055 --> 00:48:18.130
that I've been [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:18.130 --> 00:48:23.520
First of all, do you think
that's true, and [INAUDIBLE]..

00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:25.650
MAGNUS NILSSON: I think,
yeah, I think it's

00:48:25.650 --> 00:48:28.260
absolutely true even today.

00:48:28.260 --> 00:48:30.940
The development in
the Nordic region,

00:48:30.940 --> 00:48:33.104
especially in the bigger
cities, is that people

00:48:33.104 --> 00:48:34.020
eat more and more out.

00:48:34.020 --> 00:48:37.230
It becomes more and more like
other parts of the world.

00:48:37.230 --> 00:48:40.890
But we still eat a
bigger part of our meals

00:48:40.890 --> 00:48:43.680
in the home cooked by
ourselves than almost

00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:45.330
any other Western culture does.

00:48:45.330 --> 00:48:47.490
And I think it has to
do with historically

00:48:47.490 --> 00:48:49.030
a lot of different reasons.

00:48:49.030 --> 00:48:53.619
One of them being scarcity
of population, that just not

00:48:53.619 --> 00:48:55.410
enough people in a
large part of the region

00:48:55.410 --> 00:48:57.030
to sustain restaurants.

00:48:57.030 --> 00:48:59.400
And then I think that
there are cultural factors

00:48:59.400 --> 00:49:01.590
on top of that as
well us religion,

00:49:01.590 --> 00:49:05.564
for example, and
many other things.

00:49:05.564 --> 00:49:07.230
But what I do know,
though, is that this

00:49:07.230 --> 00:49:10.680
is one of the reasons why Nordic
food culture and baking culture

00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:12.480
is so little understood.

00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:13.830
Because it's inaccessible.

00:49:13.830 --> 00:49:15.540
Not just the way I
spoke about before

00:49:15.540 --> 00:49:19.080
with recorded information.

00:49:19.080 --> 00:49:22.120
But also the practical
act of eating Nordic food.

00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:24.092
If you go to Sweden, for
example, as a tourist.

00:49:24.092 --> 00:49:25.800
You go to Stockholm
and think to yourself

00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:28.530
that I'm going to have one
traditional Swedish meal when

00:49:28.530 --> 00:49:29.250
I'm here.

00:49:29.250 --> 00:49:30.777
You're not going to get that.

00:49:30.777 --> 00:49:32.610
There's not a single
restaurant in Stockholm

00:49:32.610 --> 00:49:35.940
that produces something
that is remotely

00:49:35.940 --> 00:49:39.912
close to an authentic version of
what people eat in their homes.

00:49:39.912 --> 00:49:41.370
Because that's not
what restaurants

00:49:41.370 --> 00:49:42.450
are about in that region.

00:49:42.450 --> 00:49:47.020
And that differs a lot from
central and southern Europe,

00:49:47.020 --> 00:49:47.700
for example.

00:49:47.700 --> 00:49:51.060
It's very easy to go to
Spain and go to a restaurant

00:49:51.060 --> 00:49:53.640
and find something that's
definitely a bit adapted

00:49:53.640 --> 00:49:56.970
to the world of restaurants,
but that fairly accurately

00:49:56.970 --> 00:50:02.037
represents the same thing
as you would cook at home.

00:50:02.037 --> 00:50:02.870
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:50:02.870 --> 00:50:05.940
The other question also is there
a tradition of high altitude

00:50:05.940 --> 00:50:09.030
baking in the region?

00:50:09.030 --> 00:50:11.480
MAGNUS NILSSON: We don't
have that much high altitude

00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:12.600
in the Nordic region.

00:50:12.600 --> 00:50:16.230
And where we have
a bit of altitude--

00:50:16.230 --> 00:50:20.870
in Sweden, the tallest mountains
are like 1,500 or so meters.

00:50:20.870 --> 00:50:22.960
And no one lives there.

00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:24.720
Traditionally, no
one lived up there.

00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:27.420
It's like where I'm from--

00:50:27.420 --> 00:50:32.810
which is considered quite high
in altitude-- is 350 meters.

00:50:32.810 --> 00:50:37.030
So I don't have a
specific knowledge of it.

00:50:37.030 --> 00:50:39.670
I know that we had some
feedback from recipe testers

00:50:39.670 --> 00:50:42.450
in Mexico City, for example,
that a lot of the recipes

00:50:42.450 --> 00:50:43.817
behave very differently.

00:50:43.817 --> 00:50:45.150
Thank you guys for coming today.

00:50:45.150 --> 00:50:46.740
And thanks for having me again.

00:50:46.740 --> 00:50:49.790
[APPLAUSE]
