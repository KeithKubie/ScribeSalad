00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.360
Throughout all of our analyses of the pseudo-Facebook user data

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.300
set, we've come to learn a lot about our users.

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.790
&gt;From their birthdays, to their friend counts, to their friendships

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.220
initiated, we've really come to understand their behaviors and how they

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:15.580
use the Facebook platform. But, now I think it's time

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.420
for something completely different. In the next couple of segments,

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.920
we'll look at another data set, and then we'll return

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.510
to this Facebook data set to draw some comparisons Here's Dean

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.890
to introduce this new data set, and why we might look at it in the first place.

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.470
&gt;&gt; Because of online purchases, credit cards, and loyalty cards, lots of

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.120
retail purchase data is associated with

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.750
individuals or households, such that there

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.260
is a history of purchase data over time. Analysts in industry often mine

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.540
this panel scanner data, and economists and other behavioral scientists use

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.020
it to test and develop theories about

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.084
consumer behavior. We are going to work with a

00:00:56.084 --> 00:00:59.653
data set describing household purchases, of five

00:00:59.653 --> 00:01:03.409
flavors of Dannon yogurt in the eight-ounce size.

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:06.217
Their price is recorded with each purchase

00:01:06.217 --> 00:01:09.016
occasion. This yogurt data set has a quite

00:01:09.016 --> 00:01:12.875
different structure than our pseudo-Facebook data set.

00:01:12.875 --> 00:01:15.683
The synthetic Facebook data has one row per

00:01:15.683 --> 00:01:20.909
individual with that row giving their characteristics and counts of behaviors

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.908
over a single period of time. On the other hand, the yogurt data has many

00:01:25.908 --> 00:01:31.064
rows per household, one for each purchase occasion. This kind of microdata is

00:01:31.064 --> 00:01:33.521
often useful for answering different types of

00:01:33.521 --> 00:01:35.720
questions than we've looked at so far.
