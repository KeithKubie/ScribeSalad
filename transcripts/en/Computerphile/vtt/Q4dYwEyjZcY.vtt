00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.620
The era is the early 1990s.

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:10.380
I was aware of SGML - aware of, if you like, the very 
technical usage of it in things like the Text Encoding Initiative.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.960
I'd heard about Tim Berners-Lee's usage of SGML 
technology for Web page markup,

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.340
in the unfortunately named 'HTML'.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.800
So much better if he'd called it just 'Hypertext 
Markup', HTM,

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.180
or even, as somebody said, 'Tim's Own Tagset', 
TOT - how about that!

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.980
But not 'ML' at the end!

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:37.340
You have to remember that at exactly the same time,
almost, in the early '90s, PDF came about.

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.280
And I was doing a lot of work with Adobe.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:46.100
So there was this 'European Hypertext' meeting in
September 1994,

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:52.980
sponsored by the Association for Computing Machinery, 
which is basically our professional body in the States.

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:59.620
and I thought: "Wwell, it's all going to be about SGML, 
HTML, and all this kind of thing,

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:06.680
but just to say that there are other notations for documents, 
and other things where you can embed hyperlinks, even,

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.900
I want to talk about PDF!"

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:17.160
because my group here was, I think, the UK's first ever beta 
test site for PDF. We've got a lot of experience.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.780
And I thought: "Just as balance, I'll put in a paper about 
the use of PDF", and it was accepted,

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.000
So, I think the organisers realised you needed a bit of 
a balancing discussion.

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.480
I gave my talk and it went down very well,

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.860
although I think some of the more 'who cares about 
appearance?' brigade were...

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:40.440
"PDF, it's so messy! It looks beautiful, but inside 
it's a mess! It needs more structure!"

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.540
They just wanted the markup.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:52.220
The fact that whether you want to do it in Times Roman 
or Palatino or Optima, "That's for graphics artists to worry about.

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.280
All we're concerned is... y'know ... it's a Heading."

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:01.360
So at the end of my talk, I had a lot of very interesting 
questions - because PDF was pretty new technology.

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.640
But marching up the aisle towards me - and I did recognise 
him from photographs,

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:11.600
It's the only time we've ever met - was Tim Berners-Lee, 
now Sir Tim.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.360
He came up, shook my hand, said "I really enjoyed that."

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.940
He said, "You know, it won't go down well with everybody here,

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:26.700
but I think we're in for a document universe where we've got 
to try and make detailed, tight appearance, co-exist with structure,

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.400
and it's going to be a struggle."

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.140
How right he was! We're still struggling with those 
20, 30 years later.

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.920
So he said, "You know all this flak I've been getting about 
calling it HTML,

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.880
and why couldn't I've done my homework more thoroughly 
before I defined it?

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.560
We're having a panel session, we're going to try and 
get all these issues sorted out,

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.460
Would you like to come along?"
So I said "Yeah, sure, fine."

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:57.380
So I went into this big hall and there were parallel 
panel sessions, but this was by far and away the most popular.

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.860
Believe me, viewers, I was there.

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.780
It was wonderful!

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.580
At the front were...

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.000
people... two rival armies almost!

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.780
Standing up at the front, making their pitch.

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.980
And I classified them straight away

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.300
as either being "theologians" or "browser pragmatists".

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:21.940
And you've got to remember that this was two years 
after Tim first did the HTML thing.

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.640
And companies like Netscape, who were the leaders 
at the time,

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:30.040
and, getting in on the act, Internet Explorer from 
Microsoft,

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.860
saw immediately the potential of this standardised 
markup, which they hoped really was standardised --

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.680
or maybe they didn't hope,

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:44.980
because it became very clear that Netscape and IE 
[Internet Explorer] having got hold of this,

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.020
would love to be in a market-dominant position.

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.100
You know, extra tags were needed inside this HTML

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.060
It's good for a start, but there's all sorts of 
things you could do with it.

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.840
Let's add a few more tags!

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.600
And it goes without saying

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:02.800
that the Netscape additions were totally different 
to the Internet Explorer additions,

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:08.720
and this whole thing that we covered in the last 
video about the underlying technology of SGML

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:14.260
allowing you to omit tags so long as you thought 
it was safe to do so - well, guess what?

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:20.200
Netscape and Internet Explorer had different 
omitability specifications.

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:24.900
And one way or another, it meant that a thing 
that worked beautifully in Netscape

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.660
was going to fall over - all over the place! -
in Internet Explorer.

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.620
What was to be done about this?
There was no standards body at the time.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.700
So... they were doing their own thing, 
but in the meantime,

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:47.020
the opposing army was a bunch of people 
who'd been with SGML ever since day one, 
and loved it dearly,

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.360
and were very fond of carrying around this book,

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:54.940
['SGML Handbook' - Charles F. Goldfarb]
as if it was a sort of... some kind of precious 
holy book.

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:56.460
['SGML Handbook' - Charles F. Goldfarb]
This had the full spec.

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.260
['SGML Handbook' - Charles F. Goldfarb]
Things really started going downhill

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:03.360
when one of the theologians held this up, pointed 
at the chap from Netscape and said,

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:09.520
"If only you'd read this carefully from cover to 
cover before you wrote a SINGLE line of code,

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.080
we'd be in a lot better state than we are now!"

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.700
Oh boy, yes!
And of course, there was the immediate response,

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:21.760
saying "Some of us, buddy, don't have ten years 
to take in all of this stuff!"

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:25.620
And then it got even worse, because they said,

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:30.960
"The difficulty that you people are in, IE 
and Netscape with all this,

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:34.960
you know, it took Tim a while for us to convince him,

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:42.380
you must give a spec of when tags are omissible,
you must give the spec of what's a legal tag"

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:45.800
We call this a DTD - a Document Type Definition.

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:51.720
"Such a shame that people never thought to write 
one of these properly before they started to code!"

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:56.040
And so the guy said, "Look, are you seriously saying

00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:03.800
that it's not just checking whether this markup 
inside the Web page forms a tree and a sequence,

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:10.920
You want us to be looking, all the time, at the 
tagset spec to see what's omissible, and what isn't?"

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:16.640
"Yes, of course!" said the theologians -
you know, in unison - "Of course!

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:21.720
You keep the DTD with you while you are parsing."
The man from Netscape did a John McEnroe!

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:25.760
VOICEOVER (McENROE): "You can't be serious, man.
You CANNOT be serious!"

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:33.360
&gt;&gt; DFB: "You cannot be serious! You want me to be looking 
over my shoulder ALL THE TIME at the language spec while 
I'm just trying to display something?"

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:39.440
"Oh by the way..." said Lead Theologian,
"something else we ought to mention.

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:44.240
"When you get a partly correct Web page, but with mistakes...

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:49.520
...you're displaying part of it to people!
Don't do that!"

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:54.400
Total disbelief from the other camp,
jaws dropping - "What do you want us to do?"

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.660
"Easy! Behave like a compiler. Issue an 
error report.

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:06.180
Say, 'Error in Web page: &lt;/p&gt; tag omitted 
when this is not allowed'

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:08.840
or something like this. Just like a compiler, 
you know."

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:15.220
"Above all," said the high priest, "you display nothing!

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:20.340
Because if you display something, when it's 
incorrect, it leads to bad habits."

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:27.980
[laughing] And I think as you've said to me many a time, 
Sean, what kind of real world were these people living in?

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:33.260
Because, of course, with this being an interpreted 
system, everybody's very excited about Web pages,

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:39.340
You are going to go for the browser manufacturer 
who tolerates your inadequacies,

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:41.900
Because we're talking about hand-coded Web pages now.

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:45.560
If it tolerates you and gives you some idea of 
what's happening

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:47.900
and you can sort of see where I must've gone wrong, fine!

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:51.840
But to sort of end up with a great long list of 
compiler error messages

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:56.240
saying "Your page is deficient. Try again. Recompile",
and so on,

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:59.340
it's obviously not gonna go down well.

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:04.900
&gt;&gt; SEAN: I can imagine if Safari, Firefox or Chrome 
just didn't display anything

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:07.860
because there was a mistake on it,
I'm not gonna use that browser.

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:09.300
&gt;&gt; DFB: No! Exactly so!

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:14.180
And I mean the other thing that the high priests 
were getting really upset about

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:18.940
was - we all know that inside a well-constructed 
Web page -

00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:22.560
You open a &lt;p&gt;, and you close a &lt;/p&gt;
[with a forward stroke] for a paragraph.

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:25.980
But inside that, you say,
"Oh I want all of this to be in bold."

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:29.160
So you open up a bold tag, and you should 
close the bold tag.

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:31.960
But what happens if you do it in the wrong order?

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:34.160
You open a &lt;p&gt;, you open a &lt;b&gt;,

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:36.800
&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
but then instead of closing &lt;/b&gt; and closing &lt;/p&gt;,

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:38.360
&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/b&gt;
 
...you do that.

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:40.220
&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/b&gt;
 
That's called an overlapping hierarchy -

00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:43.540
You turn off 'paragraph' before you turn off 'bold',
it should be the other way around.

00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:50.460
Again, absolute fury from the theologians -
"You are allowing overlapping hierarchies! 
Just ignoring..."

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:53.860
...and all this kind of stuff(!)
I mean... oh, it was wonderful!

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:58.600
And to my great dismay, I actually had to leave 
the meeting early.

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:02.500
Believe it or not, later that day, I was flying down 
from Edinburgh to Birmingham

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:05.280
because I was down, somewhere, to give a talk about PDF.

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:08.860
It was essentially a very similar one to the one 
I'd given in Edinburgh.

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:15.020
So I went away and just thought, "This is incredible",
but realising this was a watershed.

00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:19.820
It was really THE meeting to be at and when you 
looked at the title of it, y'know  -

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:22.700
'Is it Poison or Panacea', HTML?

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:26.600
Panacea, of course, is a Greek word, I think,
for a cure-all, isn't it?

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:29.680
&gt;&gt; SEAN: Yeah, that's it, yeah.
&gt;&gt; DFB: Yeah 'cure for all ills', I think, 
is what it means,

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:36.760
And it was a very good choice of title, and it 
was THE most significant confrontation I've think 
I've ever been to in my life.

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:41.720
And I think Tim sent me an email afterwards, or 
maybe somebody told me about this, but anyway,

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:46.540
I got a message but I had to go to Birmingham, cursing 
having to get the plane.

00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:48.160
And I sort of said, "What happened?"

00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:54.820
He said: "Easy!" [inhales] "Told them all they were all 
correct, and took them off to the pub,

00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:56.280
and bought lots of pints of beer.

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:59.080
We had a very good meeting that went on into the evening."

00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:04.740
And what Tim asked was for Jon Bosak of Sun Microsystems

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:09.560
and Tim Bray, a very respected SGML user and guru,

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:17.500
to please lead a committee of experts -
first of all, actually for HTML itself -

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:20.780
"Please will you write me a DTD?
I know I should've done one,

00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:26.440
but is it possible to write a DTD that makes 
it SGML compliant?

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:34.380
But then, can you tackle the problem of saying 
SGML is problematical because it allows omitted end tags?"

00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:37.660
plus all sorts of other things, minor things.

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:47.180
Can you within 18 months, no more, do a very quick report 
on how to do a subset of full SGML

00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:51.340
that's cleaner, which insists on end-tags being there,

00:10:51.640 --> 00:11:02.120
which doesn't allow - as SGML does - for the fact that &lt;PARA&gt; 
in capitals as being treated the same as &lt;para&gt; in lower-case,

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:08.980
This is a hangover from punch card days, you see, 
where everything tended to end up in upper case anyway,

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:15.800
and all sorts of horrendous things - you could put pointy 
bracket comments in the middle of a tag declaration?"

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:23.920
Various other more specialised nightmares which I'll 
put out for you in accompanying notes to go with this video.

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:31.480
And basically, it was agreed - "We've got to get this 
out quickly" - what came to be known as XML.

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:39.360
And they were as good as their word. I think it was 
1996 when the first XML draft spec was delivered.

00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:47.400
They came up with two things: XML - which is a subset, 
the clean, abstract subset -

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:55.220
But the second thing they did while they were at it was 
to say "Right, we've done you a DTD for the SGML version of HTML,

00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:57.840
"We wrote you the DTD, Tim, that you should've years ago,

00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:04.260
"But just notice how much cleaner and nicer the tag set 
spec is when we do it with XML

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:09.580
and we don't let omitted end tags happen, ever!"
And everybody was convinced,

00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:13.640
and said, "Oh, who cares about extra disk space? 
It doesn't cost anything these days."

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:19.480
&gt;&gt; SEAN: These kind of conferences and panel discussions 
and confrontation,

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:22.480
Do they accomplish as much as a night in the pub?

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:26.080
&gt;&gt; DFB: [laughs] I think you needed both.

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:30.140
You needed the full and frank exchange of opinions,

00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:33.780
but then you needed a calming-down period with lots 
of beer in the pub,

00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:41.480
And I think the assertion that actually there was 
right on both sides is absolutely correct,

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:48.660
A lot of good lessons were learned from that, yeah.

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:54.720
I think it was Tim and others, but they chose well in 
asking Jon Bosak of Sun, and Tim Bray,

00:12:54.720 --> 00:13:01.640
some very respected authorities to actually try and 
get the basic tagset technology sorted,

00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:07.160
the XML to be a proper subset of SGML,

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:15.480
And in one of the requirements spec it says,
"Brevity is to be of minimal importance."

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:22.000
In other words: "Don't go bananas about missing out 
all your end tags because it halves the size of your files.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.620
We don't care any more. If they're tough to parse, fine."

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:32.900
And the thing they ended up with in XML was what the browser 
people wanted all along.

00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:38.960
To say, "I don't need to know the full tag set spec in 
the first instance,

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:44.580
I just want to check if what you've given me - that  all 
the tags match and it's a tree?

00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:49.800
I don't care what it says in the tags, but do they match 
up correctly to form a tree structure?

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:56.600
I don't need to have the DTD to tell if it's a tree 
structure, whereas with SGML you did."

00:13:56.600 --> 00:14:01.000
So there we are. The power of several pints of beer, 
isn't it wonderful?
