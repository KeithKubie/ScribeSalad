00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.910
be it'll probably be intuitive for you
for a linear function and maybe even for

it to you in the next video or at least

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120
it to you in the next video or at least
 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.849
it to you in the next video or at least
show you example in the general case of

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859
show you example in the general case of
 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.460
show you example in the general case of
why it makes sense but the way to tell a

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470
why it makes sense but the way to tell a
 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.780
why it makes sense but the way to tell a
linear function is that when you

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790
linear function is that when you
 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.750
linear function is that when you
increment X by a constant amount Y will

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760
increment X by a constant amount Y will
 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.210
increment X by a constant amount Y will
always change by a constant amount so

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220
always change by a constant amount so
 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.580
always change by a constant amount so
when you always increase X by 1 y should

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590
when you always increase X by 1 y should
 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.219
when you always increase X by 1 y should
always increase by a certain amount so

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229
always increase by a certain amount so
 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.039
always increase by a certain amount so
let's look let's just using that as our

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049
let's look let's just using that as our
 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.190
let's look let's just using that as our
kind of our first guideline let's see

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200
kind of our first guideline let's see
 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.980
kind of our first guideline let's see
which of these represent a linear

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990
which of these represent a linear
 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.190
which of these represent a linear
function so over here so in all of these

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200
function so over here so in all of these
 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.080
function so over here so in all of these
examples as we go from one data point to

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090
examples as we go from one data point to
 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.210
examples as we go from one data point to
the next we're increasing X by one and

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220
the next we're increasing X by one and
 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.230
the next we're increasing X by one and
it's very important that you pay

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240
it's very important that you pay
 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.640
it's very important that you pay
attention to that because if you'd if

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650
attention to that because if you'd if
 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:35.929
attention to that because if you'd if
you weren't you would have to adjust

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939
you weren't you would have to adjust
 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.730
you weren't you would have to adjust
things a little bit but in all of these

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740
things a little bit but in all of these
 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.999
things a little bit but in all of these
we're always increasing X by one so

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009
we're always increasing X by one so
 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.160
we're always increasing X by one so
let's look at our change in Y's when we

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170
let's look at our change in Y's when we
 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.389
let's look at our change in Y's when we
go from the first data point to the

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399
go from the first data point to the
 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.179
go from the first data point to the
second data point our change in Y is 60

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189
second data point our change in Y is 60
 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.920
second data point our change in Y is 60
when we go to the second to the third

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930
when we go to the second to the third
 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.980
when we go to the second to the third
our change in Y is 90 so that

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990
our change in Y is 90 so that
 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.510
our change in Y is 90 so that
immediately tells us we're not dealing

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520
immediately tells us we're not dealing
 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.389
immediately tells us we're not dealing
with a linear function when our change

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399
with a linear function when our change
 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.240
with a linear function when our change
in X is 1 our change in Y here is 60

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250
in X is 1 our change in Y here is 60
 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.429
in X is 1 our change in Y here is 60
then it's 90 and then as you go here

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439
then it's 90 and then as you go here
 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.550
then it's 90 and then as you go here
what it's like 135 so this one is

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560
what it's like 135 so this one is
 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.639
what it's like 135 so this one is
clearly not linear let's look at this

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649
clearly not linear let's look at this
 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.999
clearly not linear let's look at this
one over here our first change in Y is 2

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009
one over here our first change in Y is 2
 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.850
one over here our first change in Y is 2
then our next change in Y is

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860
then our next change in Y is
 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.730
then our next change in Y is
once again not linear as we increment X

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740
once again not linear as we increment X
 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.360
once again not linear as we increment X
by by a constant amount our Y does not

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370
by by a constant amount our Y does not
 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.430
by by a constant amount our Y does not
increase or decrease at a constant

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440
increase or decrease at a constant
 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.380
increase or decrease at a constant
amount so once again this one is not

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390
amount so once again this one is not
 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.840
amount so once again this one is not
linear now let's look over here once

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850
linear now let's look over here once
 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.390
linear now let's look over here once
again we're increasing X by 1 through on

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400
again we're increasing X by 1 through on
 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.340
again we're increasing X by 1 through on
every data point and when we go from

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350
every data point and when we go from
 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:32.870
every data point and when we go from
this first data point to the second data

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880
this first data point to the second data
 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.470
this first data point to the second data
point y decreases by 3 then we go from

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480
point y decreases by 3 then we go from
 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.240
point y decreases by 3 then we go from
the second to the third once again y

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250
the second to the third once again y
 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.000
the second to the third once again y
decreases by 3/3 to the fourth y

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010
decreases by 3/3 to the fourth y
 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.120
decreases by 3/3 to the fourth y
decreases by 3 1 to negative 2 once

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130
decreases by 3 1 to negative 2 once
 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.030
decreases by 3 1 to negative 2 once
again decreases by 3 and we just keep

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040
again decreases by 3 and we just keep
 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.700
again decreases by 3 and we just keep
decreasing by 3 so whenever we change X

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710
decreasing by 3 so whenever we change X
 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:53.990
decreasing by 3 so whenever we change X
by 1 when we increase X by 1 Y goes down

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000
by 1 when we increase X by 1 Y goes down
 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.720
by 1 when we increase X by 1 Y goes down
by negative 3 so we actually have a

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730
by negative 3 so we actually have a
 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.000
by negative 3 so we actually have a
constant slope we could say our change

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010
constant slope we could say our change
 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.630
constant slope we could say our change
in Y over change in X is equal to when X

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640
in Y over change in X is equal to when X
 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.590
in Y over change in X is equal to when X
is goes up by 1 Y goes down by 3 this is

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600
is goes up by 1 Y goes down by 3 this is
 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.170
is goes up by 1 Y goes down by 3 this is
the definition of slope this is the M in

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180
the definition of slope this is the M in
 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.330
the definition of slope this is the M in
this equation right here our changes are

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340
this equation right here our changes are
 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.600
this equation right here our changes are
constant so this one right here is

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610
constant so this one right here is
 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:18.320
constant so this one right here is
linear this one right here is linear not

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330
linear this one right here is linear not
 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.270
linear this one right here is linear not
quadratic there's an interesting we

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280
quadratic there's an interesting we
 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.590
quadratic there's an interesting we
could call it a trick right now because

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600
could call it a trick right now because
 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.300
could call it a trick right now because
I haven't really showed you why it works

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310
I haven't really showed you why it works
 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.009
I haven't really showed you why it works
but a quadratic your changes in Y the

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019
but a quadratic your changes in Y the
 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:30.800
but a quadratic your changes in Y the
the changes in Y are not going to be

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810
the changes in Y are not going to be
 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.600
the changes in Y are not going to be
constant as was the case in the linear

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610
constant as was the case in the linear
 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.720
constant as was the case in the linear
but the change in the changes of Y will

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730
but the change in the changes of Y will
 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.490
but the change in the changes of Y will
be constant let me write that down it

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500
be constant let me write that down it
 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:38.930
be constant let me write that down it
probably makes no sense to you right now

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940
probably makes no sense to you right now
 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.220
probably makes no sense to you right now
but when you see an example a little

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230
but when you see an example a little
 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:46.990
but when you see an example a little
it'll be kind of fun change change in

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000
it'll be kind of fun change change in
 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:55.310
it'll be kind of fun change change in
change in Y constant constant let me

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320
change in Y constant constant let me
 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.680
change in Y constant constant let me
show you what I mean so over here let's

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690
show you what I mean so over here let's
 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.479
show you what I mean so over here let's
look at this first one over here so we

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489
look at this first one over here so we
 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:01.009
look at this first one over here so we
went from 120 to 180 that was an

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019
went from 120 to 180 that was an
 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:04.009
went from 120 to 180 that was an
increase of 60 180 to 270 that was an

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019
increase of 60 180 to 270 that was an
 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:06.920
increase of 60 180 to 270 that was an
increase of 90 then we went from 270 to

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930
increase of 90 then we went from 270 to
 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:12.470
increase of 90 then we went from 270 to
405 which is an increase of 135 now when

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480
405 which is an increase of 135 now when
 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.180
405 which is an increase of 135 now when
I talk about the change in the change of

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190
I talk about the change in the change of
 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.640
I talk about the change in the change of
Y these are the change in Y's what are

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650
Y these are the change in Y's what are
 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.699
Y these are the change in Y's what are
the change in the change of Y's well we

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709
the change in the change of Y's well we
 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:21.289
the change in the change of Y's well we
went we had a change of 60 then we had a

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299
went we had a change of 60 then we had a
 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:24.020
went we had a change of 60 then we had a
change of 90 so that was a change in the

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030
change of 90 so that was a change in the
 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.110
change of 90 so that was a change in the
change of Y of 30 or

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120
change of Y of 30 or
 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.490
change of Y of 30 or
difference of the difference you could

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500
difference of the difference you could
 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.740
difference of the difference you could
view it that way if you like then we go

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750
view it that way if you like then we go
 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.689
view it that way if you like then we go
from then we had a change of 90 and then

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:32.699
from then we had a change of 90 and then
 

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:34.969
from then we had a change of 90 and then
we had a change of 135 so the change in

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:34.979
we had a change of 135 so the change in
 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:39.710
we had a change of 135 so the change in
the change let's see that is 45 so here

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720
the change let's see that is 45 so here
 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.659
the change let's see that is 45 so here
the change in the change in Y or the

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:41.669
the change in the change in Y or the
 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:43.280
the change in the change in Y or the
difference of the difference is not

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:43.290
difference of the difference is not
 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:47.330
difference of the difference is not
constant we grew by 60 and then we grew

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340
constant we grew by 60 and then we grew
 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.180
constant we grew by 60 and then we grew
by 90 which was 30 more than 60 then we

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190
by 90 which was 30 more than 60 then we
 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.939
by 90 which was 30 more than 60 then we
grew by 135 which is 45 more than 90 so

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:52.949
grew by 135 which is 45 more than 90 so
 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:55.010
grew by 135 which is 45 more than 90 so
this is not constant over here so this

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020
this is not constant over here so this
 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.260
this is not constant over here so this
tells us that this is not a quadratic

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270
tells us that this is not a quadratic
 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.540
tells us that this is not a quadratic
function now let's look at this over

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550
function now let's look at this over
 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:02.840
function now let's look at this over
here the change in the chicken Y let's

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:02.850
here the change in the chicken Y let's
 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:03.409
here the change in the chicken Y let's
write that down

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:03.419
write that down
 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:05.570
write that down
this clearly was not linear we increased

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580
this clearly was not linear we increased
 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.379
this clearly was not linear we increased
by 2 here increased by 0 here increased

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:09.389
by 2 here increased by 0 here increased
 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:12.320
by 2 here increased by 0 here increased
by negative 2 here increased by negative

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.330
by negative 2 here increased by negative
 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.680
by negative 2 here increased by negative
4 here increased by negative 6 there the

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:15.690
4 here increased by negative 6 there the
 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.390
4 here increased by negative 6 there the
change in Y's are definitely not

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400
change in Y's are definitely not
 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.010
change in Y's are definitely not
constant but let's look at the change in

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:19.020
constant but let's look at the change in
 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.860
constant but let's look at the change in
the change of Y's so we increased by 2

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:21.870
the change of Y's so we increased by 2
 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:24.320
the change of Y's so we increased by 2
then we increased by 0 so this was a

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:24.330
then we increased by 0 so this was a
 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.659
then we increased by 0 so this was a
negative 2 in the change in the change

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:26.669
negative 2 in the change in the change
 

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:28.700
negative 2 in the change in the change
of Y or the difference of the difference

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:28.710
of Y or the difference of the difference
 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:32.150
of Y or the difference of the difference
then when you go from 0 to negative 2 we

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:32.160
then when you go from 0 to negative 2 we
 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.100
then when you go from 0 to negative 2 we
changed by 0 then we changed by negative

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:34.110
changed by 0 then we changed by negative
 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:36.710
changed by 0 then we changed by negative
2 that is a change in the change of

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:36.720
2 that is a change in the change of
 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.990
2 that is a change in the change of
negative 2 then you go from negative 2

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:39.000
negative 2 then you go from negative 2
 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.120
negative 2 then you go from negative 2
to negative 4 a change in the change of

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:41.130
to negative 4 a change in the change of
 

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:42.980
to negative 4 a change in the change of
negative 2 this one's starting to look

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:42.990
negative 2 this one's starting to look
 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.200
negative 2 this one's starting to look
quadratic we changed by negative 4 then

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:45.210
quadratic we changed by negative 4 then
 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:47.360
quadratic we changed by negative 4 then
we changed by negative 6 once again a

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:47.370
we changed by negative 6 once again a
 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:50.810
we changed by negative 6 once again a
change in the change of negative 2 so

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:50.820
change in the change of negative 2 so
 

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:54.790
change in the change of negative 2 so
this data right here fits fits our

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:54.800
this data right here fits fits our
 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.740
this data right here fits fits our
requirement for quadratic and I'm just

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:57.750
requirement for quadratic and I'm just
 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:59.060
requirement for quadratic and I'm just
kind of giving it to you as a trick

00:05:59.060 --> 00:05:59.070
kind of giving it to you as a trick
 

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:00.350
kind of giving it to you as a trick
right now in the next video actually

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:00.360
right now in the next video actually
 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.700
right now in the next video actually
show you why this works I'll show you an

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:01.710
show you why this works I'll show you an
 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:03.080
show you why this works I'll show you an
example or just so you get the gut

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:03.090
example or just so you get the gut
 

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:05.210
example or just so you get the gut
feeling of why it should work so this

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:05.220
feeling of why it should work so this
 

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:09.830
feeling of why it should work so this
one right here is quadratic so you might

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:09.840
one right here is quadratic so you might
 

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.240
one right here is quadratic so you might
say hey Sal you know give us three

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:11.250
say hey Sal you know give us three
 

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:12.409
say hey Sal you know give us three
examples one of them's going to be

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:12.419
examples one of them's going to be
 

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:13.430
examples one of them's going to be
linear one of them is going to be

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:13.440
linear one of them is going to be
 

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.110
linear one of them is going to be
quadratic one's going to be exponential

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.120
quadratic one's going to be exponential
 

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.909
quadratic one's going to be exponential
this one's probably going to be

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:16.919
this one's probably going to be
 

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:19.430
this one's probably going to be
exponential and you are probably right

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:19.440
exponential and you are probably right
 

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.800
exponential and you are probably right
but let me give you the way that we can

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:21.810
but let me give you the way that we can
 

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:24.529
but let me give you the way that we can
figure out if something is exponential

00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:24.539
figure out if something is exponential
 

00:06:24.539 --> 00:06:27.439
figure out if something is exponential
so when x increases by one in an

00:06:27.439 --> 00:06:27.449
so when x increases by one in an
 

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:30.050
so when x increases by one in an
exponential you should always have a

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:30.060
exponential you should always have a
 

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:33.200
exponential you should always have a
constant multiplying factor so when you

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:33.210
constant multiplying factor so when you
 

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:35.270
constant multiplying factor so when you
go from one term to the next term they

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:35.280
go from one term to the next term they
 

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:37.159
go from one term to the next term they
should be that they should be a similar

00:06:37.159 --> 00:06:37.169
should be that they should be a similar
 

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:39.600
should be that they should be a similar
ratio from one to the next

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:39.610
ratio from one to the next
 

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:42.059
ratio from one to the next
set of just subtracting in this case 120

00:06:42.059 --> 00:06:42.069
set of just subtracting in this case 120
 

00:06:42.069 --> 00:06:45.059
set of just subtracting in this case 120
from 180 and 180 from 270 to test for an

00:06:45.059 --> 00:06:45.069
from 180 and 180 from 270 to test for an
 

00:06:45.069 --> 00:06:47.369
from 180 and 180 from 270 to test for an
exponential function what you want to do

00:06:47.369 --> 00:06:47.379
exponential function what you want to do
 

00:06:47.379 --> 00:06:50.909
exponential function what you want to do
is check whether the ratio of when you

00:06:50.909 --> 00:06:50.919
is check whether the ratio of when you
 

00:06:50.919 --> 00:06:53.100
is check whether the ratio of when you
increment X by constant amount whether

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:53.110
increment X by constant amount whether
 

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:55.679
increment X by constant amount whether
the ratio of the Y's are the same so

00:06:55.679 --> 00:06:55.689
the ratio of the Y's are the same so
 

00:06:55.689 --> 00:06:58.670
the ratio of the Y's are the same so
when we increase X by one y went from

00:06:58.670 --> 00:06:58.680
when we increase X by one y went from
 

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:04.770
when we increase X by one y went from
120 to 180 so it increased by 18 over 12

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:04.780
120 to 180 so it increased by 18 over 12
 

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:08.010
120 to 180 so it increased by 18 over 12
is 1.5 so when we went from this term to

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:08.020
is 1.5 so when we went from this term to
 

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:10.050
is 1.5 so when we went from this term to
this term let me clear all of this stuff

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:10.060
this term let me clear all of this stuff
 

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:16.679
this term let me clear all of this stuff
out here let me clear this so when we

00:07:16.679 --> 00:07:16.689
out here let me clear this so when we
 

00:07:16.689 --> 00:07:18.719
out here let me clear this so when we
went from here to here this was times

00:07:18.719 --> 00:07:18.729
went from here to here this was times
 

00:07:18.729 --> 00:07:21.689
went from here to here this was times
one point five and then when we go from

00:07:21.689 --> 00:07:21.699
one point five and then when we go from
 

00:07:21.699 --> 00:07:24.420
one point five and then when we go from
180 to 270 once again that looks like

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:24.430
180 to 270 once again that looks like
 

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:25.950
180 to 270 once again that looks like
we're going times one point five right

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:25.960
we're going times one point five right
 

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:29.459
we're going times one point five right
half of 180 is 90 add that to 270 so

00:07:29.459 --> 00:07:29.469
half of 180 is 90 add that to 270 so
 

00:07:29.469 --> 00:07:31.469
half of 180 is 90 add that to 270 so
once again we're increasing by one point

00:07:31.469 --> 00:07:31.479
once again we're increasing by one point
 

00:07:31.479 --> 00:07:36.959
once again we're increasing by one point
five to 72 405 half of 270 is 135 that's

00:07:36.959 --> 00:07:36.969
five to 72 405 half of 270 is 135 that's
 

00:07:36.969 --> 00:07:38.519
five to 72 405 half of 270 is 135 that's
how much we're increasing by so once

00:07:38.519 --> 00:07:38.529
how much we're increasing by so once
 

00:07:38.529 --> 00:07:40.320
how much we're increasing by so once
again we're increasing by one point five

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:40.330
again we're increasing by one point five
 

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:42.450
again we're increasing by one point five
so every step of this way we are

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:42.460
so every step of this way we are
 

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:44.760
so every step of this way we are
multiplying that the previous term by

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:44.770
multiplying that the previous term by
 

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:46.559
multiplying that the previous term by
one point five to get the next and that

00:07:46.559 --> 00:07:46.569
one point five to get the next and that
 

00:07:46.569 --> 00:07:49.019
one point five to get the next and that
actually tells us that actually tells us

00:07:49.019 --> 00:07:49.029
actually tells us that actually tells us
 

00:07:49.029 --> 00:07:52.740
actually tells us that actually tells us
that this right here is a one point five

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:52.750
that this right here is a one point five
 

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:56.129
that this right here is a one point five
but the our point here isn't to actually

00:07:56.129 --> 00:07:56.139
but the our point here isn't to actually
 

00:07:56.139 --> 00:07:57.959
but the our point here isn't to actually
figure out the formula so the point here

00:07:57.959 --> 00:07:57.969
figure out the formula so the point here
 

00:07:57.969 --> 00:07:59.790
figure out the formula so the point here
is to classify them so now we know

00:07:59.790 --> 00:07:59.800
is to classify them so now we know
 

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:02.550
is to classify them so now we know
definitively that this right here at

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:02.560
definitively that this right here at
 

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:05.059
definitively that this right here at
least given the data we have is an

00:08:05.059 --> 00:08:05.069
least given the data we have is an
 

00:08:05.069 --> 00:08:10.290
least given the data we have is an
exponential exponential function anyway

00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:10.300
exponential exponential function anyway
 

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:12.450
exponential exponential function anyway
hopefully you found that hopefully you

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:12.460
hopefully you found that hopefully you
 

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:15.300
hopefully you found that hopefully you
found that fun
