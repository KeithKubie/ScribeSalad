[ TIRES SCREECH ]

00:00:06.567 --> 00:00:07.901
SWEET RIDE!

00:00:07.901 --> 00:00:10.033
ALL IT NEEDS IS
A NEW PAIR OF WHEELS.

00:00:10.033 --> 00:00:12.534
Narrator: TO TEST THE EFFICACY
OF DUCT TAPE TIRES,

00:00:12.534 --> 00:00:15.734
THE TEAM'S STARTING OFF
A LITTLE SLOWER

00:00:15.734 --> 00:00:17.801
AND BEGINNING WITH A BIKE.

00:00:17.801 --> 00:00:19.801
HERE WE GO.

00:00:19.801 --> 00:00:22.601
Narrator: GIVEN JESSE HAS BUILT
HIS OWN MOTORBIKE...

00:00:22.601 --> 00:00:23.734
AW, NUTS!

00:00:23.734 --> 00:00:26.267
CHANGING A BICYCLE WHEEL
PRESENTS NO PROBLEM.

[ GRUNTS ]

00:00:27.467 --> 00:00:30.033

[ LAUGHS ]

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.701
AND WE ARE DONE.

00:00:34.701 --> 00:00:37.033
-WOW.
-NINJA SKILLS.

00:00:37.033 --> 00:00:39.067
-HA.
-WE NEED TO BE METHODICAL ABOUT

00:00:39.067 --> 00:00:40.434
HOW WE BUILD OUR TIRE.

00:00:40.434 --> 00:00:43.000
I'VE TAKEN SOME MEASUREMENTS
OF A STANDARD BICYCLE TIRE

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.400
SO THAT OUR DUCT TAPE TIRE CAN
BE MODELED AFTER IT.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.801
WE USE HALF-INCH STRIPS
TO FILL THE RIM

00:00:47.801 --> 00:00:50.234
AND THEN FULL STRIPS TO MAKE THE
HEIGHT.

00:00:50.234 --> 00:00:53.200
Narrator: WITH THE SPECS,
THE GUY GO TO WORK.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.868
AND CANNAN HAS A SURPRISING
CONFESSION.

00:00:55.868 --> 00:00:58.200
I'VE NEVER RIDDEN
A BIKE BEFORE.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.734
DON'T GO TOO FAST.

00:00:59.734 --> 00:01:01.000
THIS ISN'T THAT BAD.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.300
Rachel:
AAH! OH, YOU'RE GOING TOO FAST.

[ DUCT TAPE RIPS ]

00:01:05.801 --> 00:01:08.534
THIS IS PRETTY EASY.

00:01:08.534 --> 00:01:10.334
LOOK, MOM, NO HANDS!

00:01:11.901 --> 00:01:14.367
Narrator: SEVERAL MILES
ON A ROAD TO NOWHERE

00:01:14.367 --> 00:01:16.434
AND THEY HAVE
THEIR DUCT TAPE TIRE.

00:01:16.434 --> 00:01:17.834
-CANNAN.
-YES?

00:01:17.834 --> 00:01:19.534
YOU HAVE A DUCT TAPE TIRE.

00:01:19.534 --> 00:01:22.567
OH, YEAH.

00:01:22.567 --> 00:01:26.434
Narrator: BUT WILL IT PROVIDE A
SERVICEABLE RIDE?

00:01:26.434 --> 00:01:29.734
TO FIND OUT, CUE TWO
COMPARATIVE CONTROLS.

00:01:29.734 --> 00:01:32.434
FIRST UP, REGULAR WHEELS.

00:01:32.434 --> 00:01:34.000
WE PUT THIS CUP
ON OUR BICYCLE

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.901
AND WE FILLED IT TO THE TOP
WITH WATER.

00:01:35.901 --> 00:01:37.067
GO.

00:01:37.067 --> 00:01:40.033
Cannan:
AND SHE'S OFF.

00:01:40.033 --> 00:01:43.300

ITS TURN AROUND THE COURSE...

Jesse: OH, WE'RE
EXPERIENCING SOME SPILLAGE.

00:01:45.934 --> 00:01:48.434
...WE'LL SEE HOW MUCH
WATER'S BEEN SPILLED.

00:01:48.434 --> 00:01:50.367
MY WATER IS BEAUTIFUL.

00:01:50.367 --> 00:01:52.534
Cannan: THIS SHOULD GIVE US
AN INDICATION

00:01:52.534 --> 00:01:54.801
OF HOW SMOOTH THE RIDE IS
BETWEEN EACH TEST.

00:01:54.801 --> 00:01:56.667
-WHOO!
-YEAH.

00:01:56.667 --> 00:01:58.000
FINISHED.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.667
Cannan WE STARTED OFF AT 300mL
AND NOW WE'RE AROUND 270.

00:02:02.667 --> 00:02:04.267
ALL RIGHT, LET'S SWAP OVER
THE RIMS.

00:02:04.267 --> 00:02:05.834
OKAY.

00:02:05.834 --> 00:02:11.100
Narrator: IF THE MYTH REQUIRES A
MacGYVER-STYLE SAVE,

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.334
ARE YOU READY FOR THIS?

00:02:13.334 --> 00:02:14.701

DON'T FALL!

00:02:38.834 --> 00:02:39.934
AAH!

00:02:39.934 --> 00:02:42.300
TIRES ARE REALLY USEFUL.

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.467
Narrator: ...AND NOTHING AT ALL.

NOW YOU'RE DOWN TO 85mL NOW.

NOW IT'S TIME TO TEST OUR DUCT
TAPE TIRE.

AND OUT WITH THE OLD
AND IN WITH THE NEW.

00:03:12.033 --> 00:03:15.934
YEAH. [ LAUGHS ]

00:03:15.934 --> 00:03:17.100

THREE, TWO, ONE, GO.

00:03:23.567 --> 00:03:26.667
OH, THIS ISN'T TOO BAD.

00:03:26.667 --> 00:03:30.434
SO FAR SO GOOD.

00:03:30.434 --> 00:03:32.734
THESE DUCT TAPE TIRES NOT ONLY
LOOK GOOD,

00:03:32.734 --> 00:03:34.434
THEY'RE ACTUALLY KIND OF SMOOTH.

00:03:34.434 --> 00:03:38.267
BUT THEY ALSO FEEL GOOD.

00:03:38.267 --> 00:03:42.300
WORKING A LOT BETTER
THAN THE RIMS.

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.067
LIKE IT LOOKS LIKE
SHE'S PEDALING SLOWER

00:03:44.067 --> 00:03:45.634
JUST BECAUSE OF
HOW HEAVY THEY ARE.

00:03:45.634 --> 00:03:47.033
Rachel: I DON'T EVEN CARE
HOW THEY PERFORM,

00:03:47.033 --> 00:03:48.400
I'M JUST GLAD
I'M OFF THOSE RIMS.

00:03:50.901 --> 00:03:52.534
THIS IS GREAT, DUDES.

00:03:52.534 --> 00:03:56.167
AND, FINISHED.

00:03:56.167 --> 00:03:57.501
Cannan: THE RESULTS ARE IN.

00:03:57.501 --> 00:03:59.901
THESE DUCT TAPE TIRES
ARE FANTASTIC.

00:03:59.901 --> 00:04:02.534
Cannan: RACHEL DID PRETTY WELL
WITH THE DUCT TAPE TIRE.

00:04:02.534 --> 00:04:04.534
WE DIDN'T LOSE MUCH WATER.

00:04:04.534 --> 00:04:07.100
WITH THE RIMS,
SHE DIDN'T HAVE MUCH TRACTION

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.334
SO HER BACK END SLID
OUT A LITTLE BIT

00:04:09.334 --> 00:04:11.601
AND THAT'S WHY SO MUCH WATER
WAS LOST.

00:04:13.033 --> 00:04:14.334
AAH!

00:04:14.334 --> 00:04:16.968
I THINK DUCT TAPE TIRE MIGHT BE
A VIABLE SOLUTION.
