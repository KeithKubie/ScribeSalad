uh an unusual presentation of the
 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.749
uh an unusual presentation of the
disease because it's on one side

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759

specific kind of cell was gone as in

00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:27.659
specific kind of cell was gone as in
 

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:30.979
specific kind of cell was gone as in
kind of cells which are big blank stem

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989
kind of cells which are big blank stem
 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:35.539
kind of cells which are big blank stem
cells and that was the beginning of

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:35.549
cells and that was the beginning of
 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:38.899
cells and that was the beginning of
triumph but I started writing at that

00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:38.909
triumph but I started writing at that
 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:44.030
triumph but I started writing at that
point and I realized that I would I had

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040
point and I realized that I would I had
 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.550
point and I realized that I would I had
an attitude about hope it was changing

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560
an attitude about hope it was changing
 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.720
an attitude about hope it was changing
it was in flux and I thought the search

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730
it was in flux and I thought the search
 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.119
it was in flux and I thought the search
for hope would be a good look because I

00:02:55.119 --> 00:02:55.129
for hope would be a good look because I
 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:58.970
for hope would be a good look because I
think us finding hope for me it was a

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980
think us finding hope for me it was a
 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.910
think us finding hope for me it was a
journey you know and I'm look my head's

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920
journey you know and I'm look my head's
 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.319

hope though hope and optimism are
 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:43.819
hope though hope and optimism are
different how can breed optimism and I

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829
different how can breed optimism and I
 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:46.939
different how can breed optimism and I
think I'm more optimistic about changing

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:46.949
think I'm more optimistic about changing
 

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:53.869

00:03:53.869 --> 00:03:53.879
my life that I have been there no look I
 

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:56.990
my life that I have been there no look I
mean life is a journey so for the

healthy in the SEC we don't know the
 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:05.089
healthy in the SEC we don't know the
destination and so I there are no

00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:05.099
destination and so I there are no
 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:07.039

closed and locked and I had turn away
 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:24.160
closed and locked and I had turn away
the key when it came to hope but then it

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:24.170
the key when it came to hope but then it
 

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:30.310
the key when it came to hope but then it
changed and and once I began the book it

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:30.320
changed and and once I began the book it
 

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:33.610

it really was a very personal inquiry

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:33.620
