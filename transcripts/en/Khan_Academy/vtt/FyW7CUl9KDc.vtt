00:00:01.117 --> 00:00:02.536
- [Narrator] In this video
I want to start to answer

00:00:02.536 --> 00:00:04.648
the question of how did
the environment and how did

00:00:04.648 --> 00:00:07.285
political factor impact trade?

00:00:07.285 --> 00:00:09.617
And that is a really big
question that we're not

00:00:09.617 --> 00:00:12.416
gonna answer in one video,
but I want to use a specific

00:00:12.416 --> 00:00:15.261
example to illustrate
the role of environment

00:00:15.261 --> 00:00:17.815
and the role of politics in shaping trade.

00:00:17.815 --> 00:00:22.434
So I want to start in
Birka, which is roughly here

00:00:22.434 --> 00:00:24.881
in present day Sweden.

00:00:24.881 --> 00:00:27.124
And the reason I start
here is that in the late

00:00:27.124 --> 00:00:30.419
1800s a team of archeologists
working in this site

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:33.852
uncovered a woman's
grave, among other things,

00:00:33.852 --> 00:00:36.341
and found in that grave
the ring that we see

00:00:36.341 --> 00:00:38.149
in the photo here.

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:40.319
And they've dated this
grave and the ring they

00:00:40.319 --> 00:00:42.525
found in it to somewhere
in the 9th century.

00:00:42.525 --> 00:00:47.525
So somewhere in between
the years 800 and 900 or so

00:00:47.525 --> 00:00:50.390
and we can see in our bigger
timeline that that falls

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.162
right into what's called the viking age

00:00:54.162 --> 00:00:56.619
and the vikings were people
living in Scandinavia

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:58.646
and this region shaded in red.

00:00:58.646 --> 00:01:01.148
They weren't a single political entity,

00:01:01.148 --> 00:01:03.928
there were a lot of smaller
more independent communities,

00:01:03.928 --> 00:01:07.789
but they shared a lot of
cultural characteristics.

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:10.871
So back to our ring,
firstly it's made of silver.

00:01:10.871 --> 00:01:13.999
Secondly, the bead that's
set into it is made of

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:15.963
a really high quality glass.

00:01:15.963 --> 00:01:18.764
And that's of a higher
quality that archeologists

00:01:18.764 --> 00:01:22.068
have found in Scandinavia
from this time period.

00:01:22.068 --> 00:01:25.623
So those two facts would
indicate that the ring is

00:01:25.623 --> 00:01:27.127
probably from somewhere else.

00:01:27.127 --> 00:01:29.182
There's an inscription on the ring,

00:01:29.182 --> 00:01:30.938
it's kind of hard to see,
but if you look closely

00:01:30.938 --> 00:01:33.821
you can sort of make it
out and linguists and

00:01:33.821 --> 00:01:35.962
archeologists who have
looked at this are fairly

00:01:35.962 --> 00:01:39.695
certain that this is a
form of old Arabic script.

00:01:39.695 --> 00:01:43.026
And they think it says
something along the lines

00:01:43.026 --> 00:01:44.859
of to or for Allah.

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:47.058
And I mentioned that the
vikings shared a lot of

00:01:47.058 --> 00:01:49.858
cultural characteristics and
one of those characteristics

00:01:49.858 --> 00:01:53.047
was that they all spoke Norse languages.

00:01:53.047 --> 00:01:56.622
So an Arabic inscription
on the ring implies really

00:01:56.622 --> 00:02:00.117
strongly that the ring did
not come from Scandinavia.

00:02:00.117 --> 00:02:03.543
So that should raise the
question for you of where

00:02:03.543 --> 00:02:07.463
did this ring come from and
how did it end up in Birka?

00:02:07.463 --> 00:02:09.705
So the first factor we can
look at to try and figure

00:02:09.705 --> 00:02:13.215
out where this ring came
from and how it got here

00:02:13.215 --> 00:02:15.575
is to look at the political context.

00:02:15.575 --> 00:02:17.417
The political context at any given time

00:02:17.417 --> 00:02:21.584
is gonna determine where
and what goods are traded.

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:24.400
So think about it like this,
if there are two groups

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.709
of people and they have a
relatively good political

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:28.924
relationship it's more
likely that they're gonna

00:02:28.924 --> 00:02:30.587
trade with each other, too.

00:02:30.587 --> 00:02:33.803
So if we look at the political
situation, broadly speaking,

00:02:33.803 --> 00:02:37.104
during the viking age we
have three major empires.

00:02:37.104 --> 00:02:39.827
The first in purple we
have the Byzantine Empire,

00:02:39.827 --> 00:02:43.707
which was what was left of
the Roman empire at this time.

00:02:43.707 --> 00:02:46.713
We have, in yellow, the Abbasid Caliphate,

00:02:46.713 --> 00:02:49.148
and this is the Islamic
empire that was founded

00:02:49.148 --> 00:02:50.231
in about 750.

00:02:52.371 --> 00:02:55.245
And then we have, in blue,
the Carolingian empire

00:02:55.245 --> 00:02:58.102
in Europe, and that's
named after Charlemagne who

00:02:58.102 --> 00:03:01.487
in Latin is Carolis Magnus,
so Carolingian comes

00:03:01.487 --> 00:03:02.828
from that.

00:03:02.828 --> 00:03:05.078
And I should point out on
the timeline the Carolingian

00:03:05.078 --> 00:03:08.988
empire does continue
after Charlemagne's death,

00:03:08.988 --> 00:03:12.233
it just becomes a little bit
more fractured politically.

00:03:12.233 --> 00:03:14.304
Empires tend to have large cities,

00:03:14.304 --> 00:03:17.496
they can support larger
concentrations of people,

00:03:17.496 --> 00:03:21.004
which means larger
concentrations of wealth,

00:03:21.004 --> 00:03:23.859
which in turn means that
there is more demand.

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:26.940
So cities become attractive
to traders because you

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.537
have a lot of customers in
one spot and those imperial

00:03:30.537 --> 00:03:33.458
cities, especially, tend to
concentrate a lot of wealth

00:03:33.458 --> 00:03:36.599
if they are the seat of government too.

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:38.703
So I'm gonna pull our cities onto the map,

00:03:38.703 --> 00:03:42.124
and as we look around here
we can see Aachen is the

00:03:42.124 --> 00:03:44.568
capital of the Carolingian
empire, which is actually

00:03:44.568 --> 00:03:47.153
geographically quite close to the vikings.

00:03:47.153 --> 00:03:50.065
We have Constantinople
as the Byzantine capital,

00:03:50.065 --> 00:03:52.931
and then we have Baghdad
which is the Abbasid capital

00:03:52.931 --> 00:03:53.811
down here.

00:03:53.811 --> 00:03:56.408
And when we look at those
three empires and those three

00:03:56.408 --> 00:03:59.408
cities specifically,
only one of them speaks

00:03:59.408 --> 00:04:01.389
Arabic and writes Arabic.

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:03.768
And that would be the Abbasid Caliphate.

00:04:03.768 --> 00:04:05.805
So that would mean that
the most likely place of

00:04:05.805 --> 00:04:08.981
origin for this ring was
somewhere in the Abbasid

00:04:08.981 --> 00:04:11.281
Caliphate in yellow down here.

00:04:11.281 --> 00:04:13.087
So we want to think about
why would the vikings be

00:04:13.087 --> 00:04:16.632
trading with the empire that's
farthest away from them?

00:04:16.632 --> 00:04:18.021
Well, part of the answer is political.

00:04:18.021 --> 00:04:20.871
So if we look at the
relationship between the vikings

00:04:20.871 --> 00:04:24.214
and the Carolingians, for
example, one of Charlemagne's

00:04:24.214 --> 00:04:28.094
big projects as the ruler
of the Carolingian empire

00:04:28.094 --> 00:04:32.261
was to wage war against and
try to convert the Pagans

00:04:33.432 --> 00:04:36.444
who were living on the
northeastern edge of his empire.

00:04:36.444 --> 00:04:40.138
So there's this ongoing
conflict between Charlemagne

00:04:40.138 --> 00:04:43.192
and non-Christians, including the vikings,

00:04:43.192 --> 00:04:46.489
and that tends to hurt the
potential economic relationships

00:04:46.489 --> 00:04:47.460
that they could have.

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.714
And you actually see the
vikings raid the coast of the

00:04:50.714 --> 00:04:54.747
Carolingian empire in the
ninth century, as well.

00:04:54.747 --> 00:04:57.455
So the vikings are trading
with the Byzantines

00:04:57.455 --> 00:04:59.285
and with the Abbasids,
what they're engaging in is

00:04:59.285 --> 00:05:01.300
what we call long distance trade.

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.241
So when we talk about long distance trade,

00:05:04.241 --> 00:05:07.245
what we usually see are luxury goods.

00:05:07.245 --> 00:05:10.971
And luxury goods are goods
that are rare and expensive.

00:05:10.971 --> 00:05:12.795
And so in all of these
empires what we see is

00:05:12.795 --> 00:05:15.294
the political context, the
fact that they have large

00:05:15.294 --> 00:05:18.425
powerful empires, makes it
likely that they have more

00:05:18.425 --> 00:05:20.585
advanced technology which
means that they're able to

00:05:20.585 --> 00:05:23.599
produce higher quality, more
technologically advanced,

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:25.025
goods.

00:05:25.025 --> 00:05:27.263
But then we have to ask what
do the vikings have that

00:05:27.263 --> 00:05:30.264
they would be trading with
these more advanced empires?

00:05:30.264 --> 00:05:33.516
Well one thing we can point
out here is that the vikings

00:05:33.516 --> 00:05:37.121
in Scandinavia are in a
very different climate

00:05:37.121 --> 00:05:39.312
than we have down in the Byzantine empire,

00:05:39.312 --> 00:05:42.049
in the Abbasid Caliphate,
and to a certain extent,

00:05:42.049 --> 00:05:44.154
different than even what
the Carolingians have,

00:05:44.154 --> 00:05:46.017
although we pointed out
some of the political issues

00:05:46.017 --> 00:05:49.149
prevented more trade from
occurring between them.

00:05:49.149 --> 00:05:51.952
And the point we could make
about the different climates

00:05:51.952 --> 00:05:56.119
is that climates determine
what resources are available.

00:05:57.493 --> 00:05:59.612
So if we look at what
the vikings are trading,

00:05:59.612 --> 00:06:02.658
we see things that are somewhat
unique to their climate.

00:06:02.658 --> 00:06:05.793
And when we talk about the viking traders,

00:06:05.793 --> 00:06:08.283
a lot of what they're doing
is actually coming across

00:06:08.283 --> 00:06:12.506
the Baltic Sea into this
region here, the Baltic region,

00:06:12.506 --> 00:06:16.673
we call that and they are
obtaining goods such as timber.

00:06:17.898 --> 00:06:20.600
And specifically the timber
they want are from pine trees.

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.793
And pines in the Baltic tend
to grow very tall and straight

00:06:23.793 --> 00:06:26.648
and that makes them really
attractive for building material.

00:06:26.648 --> 00:06:30.330
Also, it's much colder in
this climate and animals,

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:33.032
fur-bearing mammals,
especially will tend to grow

00:06:33.032 --> 00:06:37.207
nicer thicker coats if
they live in cold climates

00:06:37.207 --> 00:06:40.180
and that makes them more
attractive then as potential

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:42.133
clothing items.

00:06:42.133 --> 00:06:44.402
Another resource we see
frequently in the Baltic region

00:06:44.402 --> 00:06:47.445
is amber, and that is dried tree resin.

00:06:47.445 --> 00:06:50.420
And that can be polished
and shaped into stones for

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:53.911
jewelry, for decoration, as well.

00:06:53.911 --> 00:06:56.538
And the vikings also do
engage in the slave trade.

00:06:56.538 --> 00:06:59.415
They'll kidnap and take people
from this region and then

00:06:59.415 --> 00:07:01.982
trade them as slaves with
these imperial capitals,

00:07:01.982 --> 00:07:04.440
that is not something that's
necessarily influenced by

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:09.166
the environment, but it is
also a part of this trade.

00:07:09.166 --> 00:07:11.726
Some of the most popular
items that the vikings are

00:07:11.726 --> 00:07:15.586
trading for are things like
fabrics, especially silk,

00:07:15.586 --> 00:07:17.734
which is produced in these empires.

00:07:17.734 --> 00:07:19.712
I also mentioned glass earlier.

00:07:19.712 --> 00:07:22.248
We saw the glass inset in the ring,

00:07:22.248 --> 00:07:25.710
they also are making glass
vessels like drinking glasses.

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:27.477
You can see a picture of one here.

00:07:27.477 --> 00:07:30.275
And that is gonna be of a
much better quality than

00:07:30.275 --> 00:07:32.806
anything that the vikings
are able to produce.

00:07:32.806 --> 00:07:36.121
So that glass becomes an
attractive technology.

00:07:36.121 --> 00:07:38.978
There's a lot of silver
coming out of, especially,

00:07:38.978 --> 00:07:40.636
the Abbasid Caliphate.

00:07:40.636 --> 00:07:42.745
One of the reasons that
they know this trade was

00:07:42.745 --> 00:07:45.755
occurring more broadly is
that in the Baltic region

00:07:45.755 --> 00:07:49.018
and along some of the travel
routes between the Baltic

00:07:49.018 --> 00:07:51.573
and the Abbasid Caliphate
archeologists have found

00:07:51.573 --> 00:07:56.571
hordes, or large collections,
of silver Abbasid coins.

00:07:56.571 --> 00:07:59.299
And so we see here both silver and glass,

00:07:59.299 --> 00:08:01.666
the elements of that
ring that we discovered,

00:08:01.666 --> 00:08:04.698
are things that are being
traded for by the vikings

00:08:04.698 --> 00:08:07.354
coming from this region.

00:08:07.354 --> 00:08:10.859
So we see the climate
impacting to a certain extent

00:08:10.859 --> 00:08:13.274
what goods exist in different regions.

00:08:13.274 --> 00:08:15.432
So there's an environmental impact there.

00:08:15.432 --> 00:08:19.271
We also see geography or
environment affecting the

00:08:19.271 --> 00:08:21.271
transportation of goods.

00:08:22.162 --> 00:08:24.375
So what I want to do next
is pull in the commonly

00:08:24.375 --> 00:08:27.363
used trade routes at this time.

00:08:27.363 --> 00:08:29.724
And this helps us to
understand how these goods

00:08:29.724 --> 00:08:32.447
actually move between these places.

00:08:32.447 --> 00:08:35.000
So we see that the major
trade routes between the

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.239
Baltic region and the
Byzantines and the Abbasids

00:08:38.239 --> 00:08:40.839
follow major river systems.

00:08:40.839 --> 00:08:43.660
And the vikings are able
to take advantage of these

00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:46.167
river systems in part
because of the technology

00:08:46.167 --> 00:08:47.804
that they possess.

00:08:47.804 --> 00:08:49.772
So again we see the environment
playing a role in trade

00:08:49.772 --> 00:08:53.276
and determining what
routes are convenient to

00:08:53.276 --> 00:08:55.022
transport goods.

00:08:55.022 --> 00:08:58.833
And one other point I would
make about these routes

00:08:58.833 --> 00:09:02.480
that develop is we see
these cities of Novgorod,

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:06.647
of Kiev, and of Bulgar that
pop along these trade routes

00:09:07.588 --> 00:09:10.368
and these cities sort of
grow because the trade

00:09:10.368 --> 00:09:11.668
routes exist.

00:09:11.668 --> 00:09:15.848
These cities themselves become
center of trade over time.

00:09:15.848 --> 00:09:18.072
So to come back to our
ring that we started the

00:09:18.072 --> 00:09:20.366
video with, hopefully
this is looking less like

00:09:20.366 --> 00:09:24.533
an anomaly, a strange find,
and more like the natural

00:09:25.433 --> 00:09:28.887
result of the existing
trade networks that were

00:09:28.887 --> 00:09:31.707
in in place because of the
environmental and because

00:09:31.707 --> 00:09:35.207
of the political conditions at this time.
