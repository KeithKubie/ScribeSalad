00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:09.640
We have the number
7,346,521.032.

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.000
And what I want
to think about is

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.020
if I look at the same digit
in two different places,

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:17.990
in particular, I'm going
to look at the digit 3 here

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.680
and the digit 3 here, how much
more value does this left 3

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.809
represent than this right 3?

00:00:24.809 --> 00:00:26.350
In order to think
about that, we have

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:28.720
to think about place value.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.490
So let's write down
all the place values.

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:32.940
So this right over here,
this is the ones place.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.430
Now, we could move to the right.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.790
And as we move to the
right in place values,

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.060
each place represents 1/10
of the place before it.

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.620
Or you could divide by 10 as
we're moving to the right.

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:44.990
So this is the ones place.

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:46.170
This is divide by 10.

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.210
This is the 1/10 place,
or the tenths place.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.410
Divide by 10 again, this
is the hundredths place.

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.230
Divide by 10 again, this
is the thousandths place.

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.070
And that "s" I'm just saying
to be plural-- hundredths,

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.570
thousandths.

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.920
Now, if we go to the
left, now each place

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.770
represents a factor of 10 more.

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.420
So if this is ones, multiply
by 10, this is the tens place.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.220
This is the hundreds place.

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.790
This is the thousands place.

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.360
This is the ten thousands place.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.360
I'm going to have to write
a little bit smaller.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.060
This is the hundred
thousands place.

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.140
And then the 7 is in
the millions place.

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.960
So what does this number,
what does this 3 represent?

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.800
Well, it's in the
hundred thousands place.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:39.430
It literally represents
3 hundred thousands,

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:47.170
or you could say 300,000,
3 followed by five zeroes.

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.990
Now, what does this 3 represent?

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.110
It's in the hundredths place.

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.340
It literally represents
3 hundredths.

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:00.310
It represents 3
times 1/100, which

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.900
is the same thing as 3, which
is equal to 3 over-- let

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.240
me do the 3 in
that purple color.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:14.940
Which is the same
thing as 3/100,

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.860
which is the same thing as 0.03.

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.480
These are all
equivalent statements.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.490
Now let's try to answer
our original question.

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:28.060
How much larger is this
3 than that 3 there?

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.390
Well, one way to think about
it is how much would you

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.270
have to multiply this 3 by
to get to this 3 over here?

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.270
Well, one way to think
about is to look directly

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.120
at place value.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.320
So we got to multiply by 10.

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.820
Every time we
multiply by 10, that's

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.880
equivalent to thinking about
shifting it to one place

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:48.600
to the left.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:56.108
So we would have to multiply by
10 one, two, three, four, five,

00:02:56.108 --> 00:02:59.660
six, seven times.

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.482
So multiplying by
10 seven times.

00:03:01.482 --> 00:03:02.440
Let me write this down.

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.860
So this multiplied by 10 seven
times should be equal to this.

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.280
Let me rewrite this.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:13.540
300,000 should be
equal to 3/100-- let

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.270
me write it the same way.

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:25.270
3/100 multiplied by 10 seven
times, so times 10 times

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:29.600
10 times 10 times 10
times 10-- let's see,

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.370
that's five times--
times 10 times 10.

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.710
Now, multiplying
by 10 seven times

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:40.090
is the same thing as multiplying
by 1 followed by seven zeroes.

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:41.850
Every time you
multiply by 10, you're

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.520
going to get another zero here.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:52.690
So this is the same
thing as 3/100 times 1

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:58.150
followed by one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven zeroes.

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.320
So this is literally
3/100 times 10 million.

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.390
So let's see if this
actually is the case.

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:13.180
Does this actually
equal 300,000?

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:20.220
Well, if you divide 10 million
by 100, dividing 10 million

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.956
by 100, or I guess you'd
say in the numerator,

00:04:22.956 --> 00:04:24.580
you have 10 million
and the denominator

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.390
you have 100, if you were to
just multiply it like this,

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:31.420
if you view this as 3 over
100 times 10 million over 1.

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.632
Well, you divide the
numerator by 100,

00:04:33.632 --> 00:04:35.590
you're going to get rid
of two of these zeroes.

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.131
Divide the denominator
by 100, you're

00:04:37.131 --> 00:04:38.570
going to get rid
of this 100 here.

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:41.150
And so you're going to be
left with 3 times-- now

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:42.650
we got to be careful
with the commas

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.940
here, because since
I removed two zeroes,

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.310
the commas are going
to be different.

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:48.930
It's going to be
3 times-- we put

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.790
our commas in the right
place, so just like that.

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:58.075
So this simplified
to 3 times 100,000,

00:04:58.075 --> 00:05:00.420
which is indeed 300,000.

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.040
So it did work out.

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.856
Shifting the 3 one, two,
three, four, five, six,

00:05:05.856 --> 00:05:11.350
seven decimal places
makes that 3 worth 1

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:14.630
followed by seven zeroes
more, or it essentially

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:17.730
makes that 3 worth
10 million more.

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:23.590
So this 3 represents 10 million
times the value of this 3.

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:24.840
Let me write down the numbers.

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:39.910
So this 3 is 10 million
times the value of that 3.
