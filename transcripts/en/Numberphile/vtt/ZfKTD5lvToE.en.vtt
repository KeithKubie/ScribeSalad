00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.160
BRADY HARAN: So we're going to
talk about the number 8,128.

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.690
And it's a famous type of number
called perfect number.

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:11.670
Now, this was the largest
perfect number known in

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.170
antiquity, or for
very long time.

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:15.940
But what is a perfect number?

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.780
The smallest perfect number
is the number six.

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:24.430
So let's look at
the number six.

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:26.100
Now what does it mean?

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.430
What divides into six?

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:30.265
Well one divides into six.

00:00:30.265 --> 00:00:31.700
That's always true.

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.560
Two divides into six.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.830
And three divides into six.

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.750
Now, six does divide as well,
but for what we're going to

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.020
do, we're going to ignore
the number itself.

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:42.400
So ignore six.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.870
But if we add up the numbers
that divide six--

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:50.150
one, two, and three-- add them
together, and we get the

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.940
number six.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.370
We get the number itself.

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.190
So this is a perfect number
because the divisors add up to

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:58.270
the number itself.

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.920
It's not too small, and
it's not too big.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.100
It's just right.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.030
It's perfect.

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.930
And in antiquity, they
were given this

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.140
rare, perfect property.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.710
So the next one, after
6, is the number 28.

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:13.860
Let's write that down.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.150
28.

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.360
So what divides 28?

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.850
Add these together, and
you get the number 28.

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.610
It's the second perfect
number.

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.770
The third perfect number after
that, bit of a gap after that,

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:36.650
the third perfect
number is 496.

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.650
Let's look at the divisors
of this.

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:40.310
And we've got 1.

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:41.340
Quite a few of these.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.120
2, 62, 124, 248.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.690
We're running off the edge.

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.050
We add all this together in
the same way as before.

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.120
We get 496 again.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.490
It's perfect.

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.850
Now, there's only one perfect
number between 1 and 10.

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.000
That's the number 6.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.022
There's only one perfect number
between 10 and 100.

00:02:03.022 --> 00:02:04.320
That's 28.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.475
There's only one perfect number
between 100 and 1,000--

00:02:08.475 --> 00:02:09.930
496.

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:13.890
And there is only one perfect
number between 1,000 and

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.490
10,000, and that is 8,128.

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.260
Let's try it out then, OK?

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:35.090
1, 2, 4, 8, 2,032, and 4,064.

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:42.040
Add those together in the same
way, and you will get 8,128.

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.140
Today, even with our computers
that can compute massive

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.090
numbers, we have only found
47 perfect numbers.

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.890
That is all.

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.930
Four were known to the
ancient Greeks.

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.080
Still today, 21st century,
47 we've got.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.760
There may be more.

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:02.450
There may not be.

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.260
We don't know if there's
an infinite

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
many of these numbers.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.930
And that's an open question.

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.230
You'd think that that's
something we

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:11.200
would know by now.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.390
Are there infinitely many of
these or aren't there?

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.090
We don't know the answer
to that yet.

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.620
MALE SPEAKER 2: What's the
biggest perfect number?

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.300
BRADY HARAN: So far?

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.160
I wouldn't know that.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.410
Let's find out the largest
perfect number.

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.520
Well, Wolfram Alpha says, do
you mean largest integer?

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.070
There's no largest integer.

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:33.740
So that's helpful.

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:37.640
Interestingly, we don't know
if there are odd perfect

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:38.730
numbers either.

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.330
All the perfect numbers we
have found are even.

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:45.354
That's another question
we don't know.

00:03:45.354 --> 00:03:50.550
The largest known perfect
number is, apparently,

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:59.270
1,791,000 digits long.

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:00.140
Don't ask me to say it.

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:01.590
We could be here
'til next week.

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.165
But that is the full thing.

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:10.650
Nearly 2 million digits long.

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.230
I could be scrolling through
this for quite some time.
