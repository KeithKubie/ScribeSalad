significantly lower temperatures this is

significantly lower temperatures this is

collected more data from four more sites

you move northward animals are naturally

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:12.590
you move northward animals are naturally
 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:13.840
you move northward animals are naturally
more cold tolerant and were less

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:13.850
more cold tolerant and were less
 

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:17.260
more cold tolerant and were less
affected by this storm and I was able to

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:17.270
affected by this storm and I was able to
 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:21.100

show that only in the southern part of

shift so why is this important when
