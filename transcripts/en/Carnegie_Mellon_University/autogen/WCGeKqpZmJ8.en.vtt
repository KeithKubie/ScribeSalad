built it didn't help with regulation it
certainly didn't help with construction

00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:52.860
certainly didn't help with construction
 

00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:55.300
certainly didn't help with construction

regulation was also something was fairly

00:11:57.499 --> 00:11:57.509
regulation was also something was fairly
 

00:11:57.509 --> 00:11:58.819

new and were making it up as we went

00:11:58.819 --> 00:11:58.829
new and were making it up as we went

Island happened which added escalated

00:12:05.210 --> 00:12:05.220
Island happened which added escalated
 

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:07.579
Island happened which added escalated
quite a bit the amount of regulation the

00:12:07.579 --> 00:12:07.589
quite a bit the amount of regulation the
 

00:12:07.589 --> 00:12:09.139
quite a bit the amount of regulation the
industry we learned quite a bit from

00:12:09.139 --> 00:12:09.149
industry we learned quite a bit from
 

00:12:09.149 --> 00:12:11.420
industry we learned quite a bit from
that actually at the time that it

00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:11.430
that actually at the time that it
 

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:13.490
that actually at the time that it
happened it was totally catastrophic it

00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:13.500
happened it was totally catastrophic it
 

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:15.280
happened it was totally catastrophic it
stopped basically dead in its tracks

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:15.290
stopped basically dead in its tracks
 

00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:18.079

nuclear expansion in the in the late 70s
 

00:12:18.089 --> 00:12:20.360
nuclear expansion in the in the late 70s
early 80s but in retrospect is probably

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:20.370
early 80s but in retrospect is probably
 

00:12:20.370 --> 00:12:21.949
early 80s but in retrospect is probably
the best thing that that happened for

00:12:21.949 --> 00:12:21.959
the best thing that that happened for
 

00:12:21.959 --> 00:12:23.889

the industry we learn quite a bit from

00:12:23.889 --> 00:12:23.899
the industry we learn quite a bit from
 

00:12:23.899 --> 00:12:26.269
the industry we learn quite a bit from
not only from the accident but also in

00:12:26.269 --> 00:12:26.279
not only from the accident but also in
 

00:12:26.279 --> 00:12:27.889
not only from the accident but also in
terms of operations as you see in the

00:12:27.889 --> 00:12:27.899
terms of operations as you see in the
 

00:12:27.899 --> 00:12:30.559
terms of operations as you see in the
bullet there a lot of the operators in

00:12:30.559 --> 00:12:30.569
bullet there a lot of the operators in
 

00:12:30.569 --> 00:12:32.780

that bought those units in the late 60s

00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:32.790
that bought those units in the late 60s
 

00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:34.699
that bought those units in the late 60s
and early 70s but it is another way of

00:12:34.699 --> 00:12:34.709
and early 70s but it is another way of
 

00:12:34.709 --> 00:12:37.600
and early 70s but it is another way of
boiling water for the turban okay and

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:37.610
boiling water for the turban okay and
 

00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:40.879
boiling water for the turban okay and
generating steam obviously this is a

00:12:40.879 --> 00:12:40.889
generating steam obviously this is a
 

00:12:40.889 --> 00:12:42.590
generating steam obviously this is a
little bit more complicated than a gas

00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:42.600
little bit more complicated than a gas
 

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:44.720

so a hydro unit and it's taken a while

00:12:48.949 --> 00:12:48.959
so a hydro unit and it's taken a while
 

00:12:48.959 --> 00:12:51.710
so a hydro unit and it's taken a while
for the industry or they took a while

00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:51.720
for the industry or they took a while
 

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:53.299
for the industry or they took a while
for the industry to catch up with that

00:12:53.299 --> 00:12:53.309
for the industry to catch up with that
 

00:12:53.309 --> 00:12:57.230
for the industry to catch up with that
and and I was absolutely delighted that

00:12:57.230 --> 00:12:57.240
and and I was absolutely delighted that
 

00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:58.910
and and I was absolutely delighted that
when we had the problems in the Gulf and

00:12:58.910 --> 00:12:58.920
when we had the problems in the Gulf and
 

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:01.610
when we had the problems in the Gulf and
we looked at what was missing in terms

00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:01.620
we looked at what was missing in terms
 

00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:04.249
we looked at what was missing in terms
of regulation of that industry just

00:13:04.249 --> 00:13:04.259
of regulation of that industry just
 

00:13:04.259 --> 00:13:05.840
of regulation of that industry just
about everybody whose knowledge about

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:05.850
about everybody whose knowledge about
 

00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:06.660
about everybody whose knowledge about
how different

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:06.670
how different
 

00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:08.880
how different
this is regulated in the u.s. turn and

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:08.890
this is regulated in the u.s. turn and
 

00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:11.700
this is regulated in the u.s. turn and
said you need to take the example of how

00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:11.710
said you need to take the example of how
 

00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:13.860
said you need to take the example of how
nuclear industry regulated itself after

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:13.870
nuclear industry regulated itself after
 

00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:16.500
nuclear industry regulated itself after
three mile island so a lot of lessons

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:16.510
three mile island so a lot of lessons
 

00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:18.420
three mile island so a lot of lessons
learned is the bottom line and the most

00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:18.430
learned is the bottom line and the most
 

00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:19.920
learned is the bottom line and the most
important one is in the area of

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:19.930
important one is in the area of
 

00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:22.260
important one is in the area of
construction I'll give you some examples

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:22.270
construction I'll give you some examples
 

00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:25.400
construction I'll give you some examples
of that in a couple of slides obviously

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:25.410
of that in a couple of slides obviously
 

00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:28.670
of that in a couple of slides obviously
we've made a lot of strides since then

00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:28.680
we've made a lot of strides since then
 

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:32.700
we've made a lot of strides since then
today nuclear power in the u.s. is is

00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:32.710
today nuclear power in the u.s. is is
 

00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:34.470
today nuclear power in the u.s. is is
about twenty percent it's a little less

00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:34.480
about twenty percent it's a little less
 

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:36.420
about twenty percent it's a little less
than that worldwide's about sixteen

00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:36.430
than that worldwide's about sixteen
 

00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:38.940
than that worldwide's about sixteen
seventeen percent but that percentage is

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:38.950
seventeen percent but that percentage is
 

00:13:38.950 --> 00:13:40.560
seventeen percent but that percentage is
going up because the law developing

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:40.570
going up because the law developing
 

00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:42.420
going up because the law developing
world is building a lot of nuclear units

00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:42.430
world is building a lot of nuclear units
 

00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:44.490
world is building a lot of nuclear units
right now the about fifty nine units

00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:44.500
right now the about fifty nine units
 

00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:47.280
right now the about fifty nine units
under construction as we speak china

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:47.290
under construction as we speak china
 

00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:49.200
under construction as we speak china
alone is going to be putting another

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:49.210
alone is going to be putting another
 

00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:52.760
alone is going to be putting another
probably 80 units between now and 2020

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:52.770
probably 80 units between now and 2020
 

00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:56.250
probably 80 units between now and 2020
under construction so we're going to get

00:13:56.250 --> 00:13:56.260
under construction so we're going to get
 

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:57.810
under construction so we're going to get
to the states with Chinese basically

00:13:57.810 --> 00:13:57.820
to the states with Chinese basically
 

00:13:57.820 --> 00:14:02.070
to the states with Chinese basically
putting almost a unit a month online of

00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:02.080
putting almost a unit a month online of
 

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:05.010
putting almost a unit a month online of
nuclear units but back to this slide

00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:05.020
nuclear units but back to this slide
 

00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:07.980
nuclear units but back to this slide
here at the same time the regulatory

00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:07.990
here at the same time the regulatory
 

00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:09.630
here at the same time the regulatory
process which took time in the in the

00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:09.640
process which took time in the in the
 

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:11.490
process which took time in the in the
hiatus that we had available to us in

00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:11.500
hiatus that we had available to us in
 

00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:13.920
hiatus that we had available to us in
the 80s and 90s to work with a regulator

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:13.930
the 80s and 90s to work with a regulator
 

00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:15.510
the 80s and 90s to work with a regulator
and develop a much more streamlined

00:14:15.510 --> 00:14:15.520
and develop a much more streamlined
 

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:19.440
and develop a much more streamlined
process for this plan so right now if

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:19.450
process for this plan so right now if
 

00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:21.960
process for this plan so right now if
you have a licensed a pre license design

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:21.970
you have a licensed a pre license design
 

00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:25.140
you have a licensed a pre license design
in a pre license site the when you put

00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:25.150
in a pre license site the when you put
 

00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:27.060
in a pre license site the when you put
those two together the opportunity for

00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:27.070
those two together the opportunity for
 

00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:28.800
those two together the opportunity for
intervention and the uncertainty

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:28.810
intervention and the uncertainty
 

00:14:28.810 --> 00:14:31.590
intervention and the uncertainty
associated with that is very limited so

00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:31.600
associated with that is very limited so
 

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:33.690
associated with that is very limited so
the utilities can get to a stage where

00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:33.700
the utilities can get to a stage where
 

00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:35.790
the utilities can get to a stage where
they basically start building the plant

00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:35.800
they basically start building the plant
 

00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:37.110
they basically start building the plant
if they almost have a hundred percent

00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:37.120
if they almost have a hundred percent
 

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:38.820
if they almost have a hundred percent
assurances at that plant is not going to

00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:38.830
assurances at that plant is not going to
 

00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:41.340
assurances at that plant is not going to
have any additional regulatory hiccups

00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:41.350
have any additional regulatory hiccups
 

00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:44.250
have any additional regulatory hiccups
down the road the designs have improved

00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:44.260
down the road the designs have improved
 

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.650
down the road the designs have improved
a lot I'll show you again in a minute

00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:46.660
a lot I'll show you again in a minute
 

00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:48.060
a lot I'll show you again in a minute
some examples of the type of

00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:48.070
some examples of the type of
 

00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:49.950
some examples of the type of
simplifications for example who put in

00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:49.960
simplifications for example who put in
 

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:53.280
simplifications for example who put in
our design as a result of the

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:53.290
our design as a result of the
 

00:14:53.290 --> 00:14:55.260
our design as a result of the
development that took place in the 60s

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:55.270
development that took place in the 60s
 

00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:57.420
development that took place in the 60s
and 70s and then three mile island we

00:14:57.420 --> 00:14:57.430
and 70s and then three mile island we
 

00:14:57.430 --> 00:15:01.790
and 70s and then three mile island we
put an awful lot of regulatory mandated

00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:01.800
put an awful lot of regulatory mandated
 

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:04.530
put an awful lot of regulatory mandated
band-aids on me on the original design

00:15:04.530 --> 00:15:04.540
band-aids on me on the original design
 

00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:06.350
band-aids on me on the original design
we took a look at that and basically

00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:06.360
we took a look at that and basically
 

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:09.990
we took a look at that and basically
changed it drastically we also have a

00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:10.000
changed it drastically we also have a
 

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.960
changed it drastically we also have a
track record didn't have before it we

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:12.970
track record didn't have before it we
 

00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:15.810
track record didn't have before it we
now have several thousand plan years of

00:15:15.810 --> 00:15:15.820
now have several thousand plan years of
 

00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:19.330
now have several thousand plan years of
safe operation of nuclear power in

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:19.340
safe operation of nuclear power in
 

00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:22.390
safe operation of nuclear power in
Western world and then advances in in

00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:22.400
Western world and then advances in in
 

00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:23.830

marginal construction and other

00:15:23.830 --> 00:15:23.840
marginal construction and other
 

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:25.890
marginal construction and other
construction techniques have

00:15:25.890 --> 00:15:25.900
construction techniques have
 

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:28.480
construction techniques have
significantly improved our chances of

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:28.490
significantly improved our chances of
 

00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:31.990
significantly improved our chances of
delivering these bunis on one time and

simpler as you can tell them before and
 

00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:42.150
simpler as you can tell them before and
again the fact that it is simpler

00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:42.160
again the fact that it is simpler
 

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:45.190
again the fact that it is simpler

when we're building the first generation
 

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:18.190
when we're building the first generation
of plants that an awful lot of the

schedule issues and cost overruns were

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:21.410
schedule issues and cost overruns were
 

00:17:21.410 --> 00:17:23.320
schedule issues and cost overruns were
associated with the with the

in labor does not help so what we try to
 

00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:40.000
in labor does not help so what we try to
do is minimize that so now we build most

of the plant in a factory environment we

00:17:42.790 --> 00:17:42.800
of the plant in a factory environment we
 

00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:44.920
of the plant in a factory environment we
build it in modules those modules are

00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:44.930
build it in modules those modules are
 

00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:47.740
build it in modules those modules are
transported to the to the site and that

simplifies construction improves the
 

00:17:49.730 --> 00:17:51.250
simplifies construction improves the
quality control obviously because you're

00:17:51.250 --> 00:17:51.260
quality control obviously because you're
 

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:53.970
quality control obviously because you're
doing it in in a factory environment and

00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:53.980
doing it in in a factory environment and
 

00:17:53.980 --> 00:18:00.130
doing it in in a factory environment and
reduces uncertainty overall one example

00:18:00.130 --> 00:18:00.140
reduces uncertainty overall one example
 

00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:03.400
reduces uncertainty overall one example
of that and in one example of the

00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:03.410
of that and in one example of the
 

00:18:03.410 --> 00:18:05.080
of that and in one example of the
simplifications I was talking about

00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:05.090
simplifications I was talking about
 

00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:07.090

systems is the overall reductions in in

00:18:09.970 --> 00:18:09.980
systems is the overall reductions in in
 

00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:13.210
systems is the overall reductions in in
the hardware and it can be as drastic as

00:18:13.210 --> 00:18:13.220
the hardware and it can be as drastic as
 

00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:14.890
the hardware and it can be as drastic as
piping we have eighty percent less

00:18:14.890 --> 00:18:14.900
piping we have eighty percent less
 

00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:17.710

and eighty-five percent less cabling

00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:22.790
and eighty-five percent less cabling
 

00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:24.310
and eighty-five percent less cabling
obviously a lot of it has to do with

00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:24.320
obviously a lot of it has to do with
 

00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:25.750
obviously a lot of it has to do with

systems just be a absolutely transparent
 

00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:31.840
systems just be a absolutely transparent
but again a lot of less concrete a lot

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:31.850
but again a lot of less concrete a lot
 

00:18:31.850 --> 00:18:35.140
but again a lot of less concrete a lot
less pumps and valves which again

00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:35.150
less pumps and valves which again
 

00:18:35.150 --> 00:18:37.960
less pumps and valves which again
reduces costs reduces construction

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:37.970
reduces costs reduces construction
 

00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:43.990
reduces costs reduces construction

now in China they are scheduled for
 

00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:54.160
now in China they are scheduled for
completion in 2013 and you see some of

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:54.170
completion in 2013 and you see some of
 

00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:56.080

the pictures here are obviously

00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:56.090
the pictures here are obviously
 

00:18:56.090 --> 00:18:58.570
the pictures here are obviously
construction progress pictures but then

00:18:58.570 --> 00:18:58.580
construction progress pictures but then
 

00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:00.820

that's about six story building

00:19:14.350 --> 00:19:14.360
that's about six story building
 

00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:16.780
that's about six story building
equivalent that's the white portion

that's being lowered in there okay so a
 

00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:22.030
that's being lowered in there okay so a
lot of large modules that being
