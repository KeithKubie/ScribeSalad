00:00:00.474 --> 00:00:02.505
- [Voiceover] We have been
doing some interesting things

00:00:02.535 --> 00:00:04.691
in the last few videos.

00:00:04.964 --> 00:00:07.446
We let go of our Newtonian assumptions

00:00:07.476 --> 00:00:09.426
that the passage of time is the same

00:00:09.743 --> 00:00:11.876
in all initial frame of reference

00:00:11.906 --> 00:00:13.772
that time is absolute that one second

00:00:13.802 --> 00:00:15.223
in my frame of reference is the same

00:00:15.253 --> 00:00:17.285
as one second passing in
your frame of reference.

00:00:17.572 --> 00:00:21.051
We even let go of the idea
that space is absolute

00:00:21.081 --> 00:00:22.638
that one meter in a certain direction

00:00:23.006 --> 00:00:25.447
in my frame of reference
is going to be the same

00:00:25.477 --> 00:00:28.293
as one meter in your frame of reference

00:00:28.323 --> 00:00:30.419
if we're are moving at relative velocities

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:31.987
with respect to each other.

00:00:32.256 --> 00:00:34.659
And what that allows us to
do, it allowed us to reconcile

00:00:34.689 --> 00:00:36.876
what is actually observed in the universe.

00:00:37.007 --> 00:00:41.428
And that's the idea that
speed of light is an absolute.

00:00:41.458 --> 00:00:44.932
That regardless of what inertial
frame of reference we're in

00:00:45.075 --> 00:00:47.599
regardless of the speed
of the source of the light

00:00:47.831 --> 00:00:51.443
that we will always measure
light travelling at three times

00:00:51.473 --> 00:00:54.683
or roughly three times 10 to
the eighth meters per second.

00:00:54.944 --> 00:00:56.426
And when we let go of our assumptions

00:00:56.456 --> 00:00:58.680
about absolute time and absolute space

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.764
and we did assume absolute
velocity for light.

00:01:02.902 --> 00:01:05.256
It gave us a very interesting diagram

00:01:05.677 --> 00:01:09.920
because it took our x
prime axis from being

00:01:10.059 --> 00:01:13.606
on top of the x axis and
put it an angle relative

00:01:13.636 --> 00:01:15.564
to the x-axis.

00:01:15.725 --> 00:01:17.263
Now, one question that you might have

00:01:17.293 --> 00:01:19.167
is well what is this angle,
the way I've drawn it,

00:01:19.197 --> 00:01:21.333
it looks like the angle
between x prime and x

00:01:21.564 --> 00:01:24.857
is the same as the angle
between t prime and t.

00:01:24.887 --> 00:01:27.874
Or as we did in the last videos,
we turned our units in time

00:01:27.904 --> 00:01:31.574
where the units along
this axis, the ct-axis,

00:01:31.604 --> 00:01:33.044
instead of saying seconds,

00:01:33.261 --> 00:01:34.806
we're now going to measure it in meters,

00:01:34.867 --> 00:01:36.499
and once again watch the last video

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:39.388
if you're having an issue with that.

00:01:40.055 --> 00:01:43.607
But it looks like this angle
and this angle is the same.

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.311
What I want to do in this video
is feel good about the fact

00:01:46.341 --> 00:01:48.783
that they really are the same.

00:01:49.626 --> 00:01:52.197
So, one of the convenient
things when a couple videos ago,

00:01:52.227 --> 00:01:53.574
we went through this thought experiment

00:01:53.604 --> 00:01:55.215
of in my friend's frame of reference,

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:57.464
her admitting a photon of light

00:01:57.856 --> 00:01:59.179
bouncing off of the spaceship

00:01:59.209 --> 00:02:00.619
that's three times 10 to the eighth meters

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:02.554
in front of her, and
then coming back to her.

00:02:02.762 --> 00:02:06.590
As we assumed that as
we mark off the meters,

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.511
and as we mark off the seconds

00:02:08.655 --> 00:02:10.872
that the distance from the origin

00:02:10.901 --> 00:02:13.091
for three times 10 to the
eighth meters is the same

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:16.195
as the distance from the
origin is one second.

00:02:16.225 --> 00:02:18.296
And now it makes even more
sense 'cause now we call this

00:02:18.326 --> 00:02:19.473
three times 10 to the eighth meters

00:02:19.503 --> 00:02:21.846
and this times three times 10
to the eighth meters as well

00:02:22.134 --> 00:02:22.981
and so the speed...

00:02:23.011 --> 00:02:26.359
When we depict the path
of light of a photon

00:02:26.496 --> 00:02:28.726
in either of these space time diagrams,

00:02:28.894 --> 00:02:31.096
it's always going to be at a either

00:02:31.126 --> 00:02:35.289
a positive 45 degree angle
or a negative 45 degree angle

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:37.682
depending on the direction
that light is traveling in.

00:02:37.712 --> 00:02:40.180
In fact, that was what
we used to establish

00:02:40.308 --> 00:02:43.166
that this x prime axis is going to be,

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.197
it's not going to sit
on top of the x-axis,

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:46.950
it's going to be at an angle.

00:02:47.096 --> 00:02:49.091
But I don't actually
think about that angle.

00:02:49.524 --> 00:02:54.524
So, if we say that this angle
right over here is alpha

00:02:55.767 --> 00:02:59.041
and if we were to continue
this 45-degree line

00:02:59.071 --> 00:03:01.138
that we had to remember,
any path of a photon

00:03:01.168 --> 00:03:04.337
is gonna be at 45 degree
angle, so let me continue that.

00:03:04.998 --> 00:03:07.812
So, this is going to look like that

00:03:07.961 --> 00:03:09.396
and then we could go back

00:03:09.426 --> 00:03:11.733
and continue it right like that.

00:03:11.892 --> 00:03:15.517
Well, we know that this
going to be 45 degrees.

00:03:15.743 --> 00:03:18.834
45 degrees right over there
this is going to be...

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:23.078
Whoops, this is going to be
45 degrees right over there

00:03:23.334 --> 00:03:27.768
and we know, we that this
green triangle that I'm...

00:03:28.071 --> 00:03:29.749
It's not green, it's not different enough,

00:03:29.779 --> 00:03:31.157
let me get a better color.

00:03:31.425 --> 00:03:33.896
This??, no that's still green.

00:03:34.336 --> 00:03:38.213
We know that this, this purplish triangle

00:03:38.495 --> 00:03:39.989
that I'm setting up right here.

00:03:40.123 --> 00:03:42.633
This is an isosceles triangle.

00:03:42.779 --> 00:03:45.083
How do I know that this
is an isosceles triangle?

00:03:45.408 --> 00:03:49.260
Well, this hash mark right
over here, on the ct prime axis

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:51.789
that is three times 10
to the eighth meters

00:03:52.063 --> 00:03:54.685
and this hash mark on
the x prime axis is also

00:03:54.715 --> 00:03:56.447
three times 10 to the eighth meters.

00:03:56.725 --> 00:03:59.674
And, so, this side is equal to that side

00:03:59.892 --> 00:04:02.797
and so we know that the base
angles of an isosceles triangle

00:04:02.827 --> 00:04:03.693
are going to congruent.

00:04:03.723 --> 00:04:07.257
So, this angle is going to
congruent to that angle.

00:04:07.584 --> 00:04:09.120
Well, if those two angles are congruent,

00:04:09.548 --> 00:04:13.438
then this angle is going
to congruent to that angle.

00:04:13.468 --> 00:04:17.103
Because they are supplementary
to those two base angles.

00:04:17.394 --> 00:04:19.425
And so notice, if we look at...

00:04:19.716 --> 00:04:21.139
If we look at this triangle...

00:04:21.601 --> 00:04:23.052
Let me do this in a new color...

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.570
If we look at this
triangle right over here

00:04:27.725 --> 00:04:30.809
and compare it to this
triangle right over here

00:04:31.106 --> 00:04:33.471
notice they both have a 45 degree angle,

00:04:33.885 --> 00:04:36.628
they both have this blue
angle which is congruent

00:04:36.897 --> 00:04:38.684
so the third angle has to be congruent.

00:04:38.714 --> 00:04:40.374
They always have to add up to 180 degrees

00:04:40.404 --> 00:04:42.490
if you have two angles of
two different triangles

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.589
of the same, then the third
angle has to be the same

00:04:44.746 --> 00:04:47.783
and so, if this is alpha, I shall do...

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:49.411
Let's see, I've already used...

00:04:49.544 --> 00:04:52.929
I'll do four arcs there,
if that angle is alpha

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:57.440
then this angle is going
to be alpha as well.

00:04:57.835 --> 00:04:58.821
And, so, this is really interesting,

00:04:58.851 --> 00:05:00.581
it's a beautiful kind of symmetry,

00:05:01.033 --> 00:05:02.540
and it really comes out of the fact

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:05.244
that the speed of light
should always be measured

00:05:05.274 --> 00:05:07.832
at three times 10 to the
eighth meters per second

00:05:07.986 --> 00:05:10.008
in any inertial frame of reference.

00:05:10.546 --> 00:05:12.791
Notice, if we go back
to my frame of reference

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.321
that photon that I emit
from my, my flashlight

00:05:16.927 --> 00:05:18.568
it will look like this.

00:05:18.844 --> 00:05:20.218
It will look like this.

00:05:20.248 --> 00:05:23.485
It's path in this Minkowski space time

00:05:23.617 --> 00:05:25.194
from my point of view will look like that

00:05:25.728 --> 00:05:28.286
and notice, from my friend's point of view

00:05:28.316 --> 00:05:32.396
the one that's travelling
on a ship for every amount

00:05:32.426 --> 00:05:34.989
let's say, let's pick a
certain point in space time

00:05:35.019 --> 00:05:36.063
right over there.

00:05:36.481 --> 00:05:40.776
Well, her x time coordinate is
going to be right over there

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:44.882
and her ct prime coordinate is
going to be right over there

00:05:45.257 --> 00:05:46.470
so that makes sense.

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.847
In one, in one I guess
we could say light meter

00:05:49.877 --> 00:05:51.505
that thing travels a meter.

00:05:51.535 --> 00:05:53.897
So, it is still travelling
at the speed of light

00:05:53.927 --> 00:05:55.595
from her point of view.

00:05:55.745 --> 00:05:58.942
Even though, she is moving
at half the speed of light

00:05:59.253 --> 00:06:00.487
relative to me.

00:06:00.628 --> 00:06:02.180
And you can think about what would happen

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:03.651
if she was moving even faster.

00:06:04.047 --> 00:06:05.317
Someone moving even faster.

00:06:05.753 --> 00:06:08.351
Their ct prime axis
would be yet at an even,

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:10.434
at an even more severe angle

00:06:10.671 --> 00:06:14.609
so it might look something like that.

00:06:14.751 --> 00:06:16.373
And then, what would their
x prime angle look like?

00:06:16.403 --> 00:06:18.471
Well then, their x prime
angle is going to symmetric

00:06:18.862 --> 00:06:22.757
around that line that
shows the path of light,

00:06:22.787 --> 00:06:23.889
so it would look like this.

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:26.471
So, this is someone,
let's say who's moving

00:06:26.501 --> 00:06:29.435
even faster relative to me,
let's call that ct prime prime

00:06:29.687 --> 00:06:32.052
and this would be their x prime prime.

00:06:32.323 --> 00:06:33.500
As you can imagine, you get close

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:36.072
as that second frame of reference

00:06:36.102 --> 00:06:38.011
gets closer and closer to speed of light

00:06:38.407 --> 00:06:41.419
from my frame of reference,
their coordinate axis

00:06:41.449 --> 00:06:43.435
are just going to get
more and more squanched up

00:06:43.716 --> 00:06:48.236
around, around this 45 degree
angle, so that's really neat.

00:06:48.692 --> 00:06:50.002
Now, another thing I wanted to think about

00:06:50.032 --> 00:06:51.374
and now, I won't draw it in this video

00:06:51.404 --> 00:06:54.975
just 'cause I think I've
given you enough to digest is

00:06:55.652 --> 00:06:56.798
there's a symmetry here.

00:06:57.215 --> 00:06:59.477
If my friend is moving at
half the speed of light

00:06:59.753 --> 00:07:01.715
moving at half the speed of light

00:07:01.745 --> 00:07:03.688
in the positive extraction
according to me,

00:07:03.988 --> 00:07:05.768
then from her point of view,

00:07:05.798 --> 00:07:07.542
I'm moving at half the speed of light

00:07:07.783 --> 00:07:11.099
in the negative x prime direction,
so you should think about

00:07:11.129 --> 00:07:13.009
well what would if I were to,

00:07:13.039 --> 00:07:14.547
if we were to look at this right over here

00:07:14.577 --> 00:07:17.401
what would my frame of reference look like

00:07:17.431 --> 00:07:19.772
if I were to project it on top of that.
