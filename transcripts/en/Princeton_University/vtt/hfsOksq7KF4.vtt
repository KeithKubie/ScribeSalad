00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:04.859
We cannot be happier to welcome Senator
Cory Booker as our Class Day speaker.

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:14.120
Please join me in giving him a warm welcome.
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:22.800
Hello, everybody! I cannot tell

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.539
you what it means to me to be invited to
be here with you on this exceptional

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:35.160
weekend, this very long, long weekend that
you all have graduating. I want to say

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.790
first of all that I want to give
gratitude to the folks that actually

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.719
thought to invite me, some of your
student leadership, but I also on this

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:48.539
day I think it's really appropriate to give thanks
to the entire community that has created

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.610
this day and this special weekend for
you. I want to thank the faculty and the

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.530
trustees. I want to thank the staff
members. I want to thank all those who

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.579
make up the community, especially those
who often don't get thank yous. The

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.260
people who manicured the lawns, the
people who clean buildings, the people who

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:14.740
scrub toilets.
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.760
And I want to encourage everyone to
understand on your highest moments in

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:25.400
life, it's so important to let gratitude
be your gravity, to let it keep you

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.659
grounded, to understand that whatever the
accomplishment is, you're not here on

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:34.220
your own. I've been to many graduations
but to see the people that you all

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.140
brought on the stage and honored, 
especially Barbara Baldwin and Tom Sparich,

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.820
understanding that these folks
who you see every day are integral parts

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.810
of your community, that shows me the
character of this class and already

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.340
before I've even really begun my remarks
I just want you to know how special I

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.470
think that this community you all have
created is. You can give a smattering of

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:06.229
applause if you want, I'll take a smattering.
Alright, so you guys invited a Jersey

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:11.330
senator to give your remarks. I have a
lot of Jersey pride. I get a really

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:17.420
ticked off when people make fun of New
Jersey. I cannot tell you how many fights

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:23.269
I've had on the Senate floor over Jersey
respect. You know I walk around and talk

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:27.230
to all the other senators and tell them
that their states and their dagnab

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.720
mottos really are stealing from our
state.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.769
You know Colorado thinks it's all about
Rocky Mountains, they brag about their

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:37.910
beer. The first brewery was in the United
States of America, the first brewery in the

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.860
United States of America was in Hoboken,
New Jersey, dagnabbit. I get ticked off

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:48.160
when I bump into those guys from North
Carolina, Tom Tillis for crying out loud.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.070
They say they're first in flight. Well
I'll have you know that the first

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.640
recorded balloon flight excuse me the
first recorded flight in American

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:02.660
history was a balloon flight right here
in New Jersey. I get upset. Even Florida,

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:08.640
the Sunshine State for crying out - oh
listen you Floridians, back off,

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.750
because when the sun goes down on the
Sunshine State it is a New Jersey

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:21.820
invention, the light bulb, that keeps the
light on. And even you Virginians, for

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:27.940
crying out loud, what's your motto?
Virginia is for lovers? For crying out

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:33.610
loud, think about our history, people. The
drive-in movie theater was invented in

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:40.840
New Jersey. and there was a whole lot of
lovin' going on there. My mom used to

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.190
torture me as a kid, saying I was
conceived in a double feature of Sidney

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:52.900
Poitier, "In the Heat of the Night" and
"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner." I have so

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.220
much Jersey pride if you cut me I bleed
Jersey, but I want to tell you I wasn't

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:03.610
born in the state. My mom and dad met in
Washington, D.C., and so today based upon me

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:07.240
not being the only one here that's not
born and bred in New Jersey, this is a

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:12.610
very large class, by the power invested
in me by the people of New Jersey, as one

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:17.710
of the highest-ranking officials in all
of the great Garden State, I want to tell

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:25.030
you, the entire class great Class of 2018,
just like Bruce, Bon Jovi, and blueberries,

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:31.930
just like red tomatoes and Redman, you
are all now officially products of New

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.470
Jersey.
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:44.730
And that means I expect you to defend
our state everywhere you go. Now I want

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:51.510
you to know that I want to impart to you
really one conclusion that may be

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:55.280
different than you already have in your
mind. The conclusion is very simple. I

00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:02.580
want to impart to you all that you are
powerful. Now look, this is a day where

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:07.140
you're graduating from Princeton
University - sadly, I have to say as a

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:14.400
Stanford man - the number one ranked
university in all of America, but that's

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:20.940
not your power. I've learned in my life
that power has nothing to do about the

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:29.160
degrees you hold or the title you have.
Power is not measured by position. I want

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.670
you to understand that you're powerful
in a way that one of my favorite authors

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:39.240
wrote about when she said, "the most
common way people give up their power is

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:43.950
not realizing they have it in the first
place." These words are from Alice Walker

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:50.340
who wrote powerfully and movingly and
compellingly about what real power is.

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:57.090
I want you all hopefully at the end of
my remarks to think about your power in

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:03.570
a different way and, as you strive to put
more lines on your resume, to realize

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:10.350
that that resume will never ever reflect
the truth of how powerful you are. I want

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:16.490
you to perhaps do like I do, which is to
reject the great man theory of history,

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:22.290
which writes about powerful people in
powerful positions with powerful titles

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:29.310
that moved our nation forward and to
actually remember that this nation was

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:34.800
shaped and formed most by the people
you're never going to read about in

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:39.680
history books, and I want to
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:42.839 --> 00:06:47.949
and I want to exhibit this in a simple
story that really has two parts. One part

00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:53.139
of the story I've known all my life, and
the other part, the second half of the

00:06:53.139 --> 00:06:58.539
story, I learned about in recent years
that just knocked me over. Well the first

00:06:58.539 --> 00:07:02.709
half of the story I've told many times.
It's sort of my origin story, which I bet

00:07:02.709 --> 00:07:05.979
for a lot of people in your audience
because all of us come from humble

00:07:05.979 --> 00:07:09.639
backgrounds, if you go further enough
back in our families trees, there's

00:07:09.639 --> 00:07:14.379
difficulties, there's oppression, there's
poverty, and for me, I heard about it all

00:07:14.379 --> 00:07:17.739
the time growing up. It was my father and
my mother telling me about their humble

00:07:17.739 --> 00:07:23.199
backgrounds. Now my dad had this this way
of exaggerating his childhood. It's like

00:07:23.199 --> 00:07:27.399
you know, "Son, I was poor." But now he would
heckle me if he heard me and say, "Don't tell

00:07:27.399 --> 00:07:30.849
those people from the Princeton
community I was poor. I was just I was

00:07:30.849 --> 00:07:34.719
just po, P-O, I couldn't afford the other
two letters. I was just a, I was just a po

00:07:34.719 --> 00:07:38.679
boy from North Carolina." And my father's
crazy. The weather, I never wanted to go

00:07:38.679 --> 00:07:42.399
to North Carolina because I thought it
was just always outrageous. And one day he

00:07:42.399 --> 00:07:46.300
started a story by telling me, "Son, let
me tell you about the time the tsunami

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:50.169
hit in my town." And I'm like, "Dad you're
from the mountains of North Carolina.

00:07:50.169 --> 00:07:54.759
There is no way a tsunami hit your town."
He's like, "Boy, don't you disrespect me.

00:07:54.759 --> 00:08:00.219
You know the Bible. Thou shalt honor thy
mother and father. It happened a long

00:08:00.219 --> 00:08:06.729
time ago before the internet so you
can't look it up but it happened." Well my

00:08:06.729 --> 00:08:12.189
dad was born poor and a humble
background and yet he was able to and

00:08:12.189 --> 00:08:16.300
his mama couldn't take care of him. He
was raised by a black family in the town

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:20.579
that took him in. When when he had no
college tradition in my family was folks

00:08:20.579 --> 00:08:25.449
in a church that that put dollars in a
collection plate so my father could

00:08:25.449 --> 00:08:30.489
afford to enroll himself in a small HBCU
called North Carolina Central. When he

00:08:30.489 --> 00:08:34.779
gets down to college and starts fighting
for opportunities he starts seeing lots

00:08:34.779 --> 00:08:38.680
of folks showing up, black folks and
white folks Christians and Jews

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:42.819
involving themselves in the civil rights
movement, bashing down doors to

00:08:42.819 --> 00:08:49.750
opportunity. He lands in Washington, D.C.,
where he meets my mom and and starts to

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:54.370
find himself because of activism
of others, not just as hard-working grit,

00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:58.210
becoming the first African-American
hired by this company and then that

00:08:58.210 --> 00:09:03.700
company, and then he becomes IBM's first
black salesman hired in the entire

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:08.730
Northern Virginia-Washington, D.C., area. 
[APPLAUSE]

00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:17.650
And this gets to the story. My father,
mother suddenly are looking for a place

00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:22.270
to live in the New York City
metropolitan area because my dad gets

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:27.220
this promotion, and they start shopping
for homes, and my mom said our guideline

00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:31.420
at first was just to find great public
schools, and they ended up looking at

00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:34.270
many of the homes were in white
neighborhoods, but when they would show

00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:38.830
up in the northern suburbs of New Jersey,
in white communities, the real estate

00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:42.700
agents would see them, and then suddenly
tell them, "Oh, I'm so sorry that this

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:48.220
house, it's it's already been sold." Or "Oh
gosh, the the the homeowners decided to

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:52.230
pull it off the market. They're not going to
be sold. They were literally steered away

00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:56.980
from white communities, and my parents
were frustrated, so they looked around

00:09:56.980 --> 00:10:02.380
and and and and and they found this
small storefront operation with a small

00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:06.670
group of folk, black folk and white folk,
Christian folk and Jewish folk, got

00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:12.029
together and and decided to try to break
this housing segregation. The year was

00:10:12.029 --> 00:10:16.570
1969. I was just a baby, and and my
parents worked with them, and these

00:10:16.570 --> 00:10:23.620
incredible lawyers came and decided that
they would would actually set up a sting

00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:27.610
operation, and my parents were pretty
psyched. So they would go look at a house.

00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:31.300
They would be told the house was sold
or pulled off the market. They would

00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:34.839
leave, and right away a white couple
would show up and they would find out

00:10:34.839 --> 00:10:39.130
the house was still for sale. Well on the
house that my parents fell in love with,

00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:44.650
the house that I would eventually grow
up in, my father and mother showed up.

00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:47.350
They were told the house was sold. The
white couple came, found out the house

00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:52.240
was still for sale. They put a bid on the
house. The bid was accepted. Papers were

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:57.970
drawn up and on the day of the closing,
instead of the white couple showing up

00:10:57.970 --> 00:11:03.060
at the real estate agent's office, 
my dad did, and a volunteer lawyer.

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:08.720
Well, they walk into the real
agent's office, and and the lawyer had

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:13.490
probably been preparing his speech all
day. He marches up to the real estate

00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:17.420
agent and says, "Sir, you are in violation
of New Jersey fair housing law" and

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:22.130
starts to give him this great, powerful
civil rights speech as my dad sat there

00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:29.840
and said "yeah, yeah" and, but then all of a
sudden, the real estate agent stands up

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:37.490
and punches my dad's lawyer in the face, in the face, and sics a dog on my

00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:43.910
dad. Now, let me tell you right now, every
time my dad would tell the story, the dog

00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:49.040
would get bigger. As I grew up eventually
I'd be walking around the house and my dad

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:52.640
would say, "Boy, don't you dare walk around
this house like you hit a triple. You

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:56.630
were born on third base, young man. Don't
you know all the things I had to do to

00:11:56.630 --> 00:12:02.020
get you in this home? I had to fight a
pack of wolves to get you in this house."

00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:12.860
And so I grew up in New Jersey, in an
incredible community that was nurturing

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:20.690
and kind, that was good to my family, and
I - it was an incredible privilege - I grew up

00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:24.410
with parents who would never let me
forget where I came from, the struggles

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:29.230
that went on, that I owed a debt that I
couldn't pay back, that I had to pay for,

00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:34.850
that I was where I was because of this
conspiracy of love. And they told me to

00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:39.200
get out into the world. And my father was
impatient. I went to Stanford, to Oxford,

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:42.590
to Yale. My dad's like, "Come on, boy, you got
more degrees than the month of July but

00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:50.090
you ain't hot." Life is not about the
degrees you get, it's about the service

00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:56.660
that you give, and so I went, while I
was still a Yale law student, moved into Newark,

00:12:56.660 --> 00:13:02.210
New Jersey, and I always say I got my B.A.
from Stanford but my Ph.D. on the streets

00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:08.240
of Newark, learning from the wisdom and
the kindness of so many people who

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:14.360
embraced me and gave me my first shot,
encouraged me, changed my life direction,

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:18.750
encouraged me to get into politics. To
this day,

00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:24.630
the map of the Central Ward of Newark
sits behind me in my Senate office

00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:28.830
because those were the folks that pushed
me into politics, believed in me, took a

00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:34.110
risk on me. To this day, I still live in
the Central Ward Newark, only senator that

00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:40.680
lives in a low-income inner-city
community, because I love my state and I

00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:53.160
love her largest city. I wish we had time
for me to tell you all the lessons I

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:58.830
learned in the decade or two that I
fought in Newark politics, joined spirit

00:13:58.830 --> 00:14:02.580
and soul with so many incredible people,
but I want to get to the second half of

00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:09.150
the story. And it involves just a few
years back, when this great state elected

00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:17.580
me to be their United States senator. Now,
I'll tell you this. It was this time

00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:24.060
again where gratitude should be your
gravity. When you get elected to be in

00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:31.800
this position that's beyond your parents'
even dreams. My mom has this saying, she says

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:40.530
"Behind every successful child is an
astonished parent." And my mom was

00:14:40.530 --> 00:14:47.010
astonished. "You're a United States senator, you wouldn't make your bed, wouldn't mow

00:14:47.010 --> 00:14:55.050
the lawn." But the challenge of my going
down to Washington for my mom and I was

00:14:55.050 --> 00:15:01.650
that six days before I was elected in a
special election, elected in October

00:15:01.650 --> 00:15:10.470
sworn in in October, six days before I
was elected, my father died. Now death can

00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:17.130
end a life, but it can't end love. And my
father's spirit was with me, but I missed

00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:21.810
him, I missed his presence, I missed his
warmth, I missed his hugs, I missed him

00:15:21.810 --> 00:15:27.120
teasing me, I missed him making fun of me,
I missed him reminding me to keep my

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:31.190
feet on the ground, not to let my head
get too big.

00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:38.279
And so in the wisdom of my mom and some
of my incredible campaign team, they're

00:15:38.279 --> 00:15:47.940
like, "Look, before you take your oath,
before you go to the vice president,

00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:53.279
Joe Biden, and raise your hand, the last
thing you're gonna do before you become

00:15:53.279 --> 00:15:56.990
a United States senator, you're gonna go
to the offices and sit down with

00:15:56.990 --> 00:16:03.510
Congressman John Lewis. And and I'll tell
you, my mom and I went to go see

00:16:03.510 --> 00:16:07.589
Congressman Lewis, and we walked into his,
office he had prepared a spread of food

00:16:07.589 --> 00:16:12.960
for us. And his office looked like a
civil rights museum, except he was in

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:19.980
every picture. And my mom and I were in
awe and the food was laid out and

00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:26.910
and and this is John Lewis. When he was
your age he was leaving his university

00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:33.870
to go join Martin Luther King. He became
one of the original Freedom Riders. He

00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:38.100
at 25 became the head of SNCC, the
Student Nonviolent Coordinating

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:44.010
Committee. He was one of only five
speakers on the March on Washington, the

00:16:44.010 --> 00:16:49.740
last one alive. He was considered one of
the bravest men in all of the civil

00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:54.870
rights movement because he got beaten time
and time again on Freedom Rides during

00:16:54.870 --> 00:17:01.050
sit-ins. On the Edmund Pettus Bridge he
had his skull fractured by the baton of

00:17:01.050 --> 00:17:07.819
an Alabama state trooper, knocked
unconscious, bleeding, that bridge red.

00:17:07.819 --> 00:17:15.860
This is a hero to me, a giant, and I'm
sitting in his office, and the man is so

00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:26.730
humble. He is just so kind. You can see it
in his eyes, and he wouldn't even let my

00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:32.160
mom and I get up to go get food. He's
taking some grits and serving us. And

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:39.929
then he's trying to tell me how, how
grateful he is to me, how much it means

00:17:39.929 --> 00:17:42.390
to
him that I should be the fourth

00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:46.410
popularly elected African-American
senator in the history of our country,

00:17:46.410 --> 00:17:52.650
that I am the manifestation of the
dreams that he had, the work that he did.

00:17:52.650 --> 00:18:00.120
I was overwhelmed. I now serve with John
Lewis, and I tell you, every time I'm with

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:07.530
him, I'm still overwhelmed. But what is
amazing about him is, he's this teacher

00:18:07.530 --> 00:18:15.510
to me in what is power. You see, it's not
about his title. It's not about his

00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:22.920
position. It's about the truth that he
lives every day. I see the way he treats

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:28.110
folk. They may be senators or cabinet
secretaries, but I also see how he treats

00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:32.970
the folk that served the food, 
that clean the hallways. He evidences to me

00:18:32.970 --> 00:18:37.200
the truth that you all should always
remember, that someone who is nice to you

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:49.290
but rude to the waiter is not a nice
person. He, he lives this life that - I talked

00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:53.400
to him and he doesn't complain. Life is
not about collecting complaints or

00:18:53.400 --> 00:19:00.060
gathering grievances. He's always
positive and proactive, and yeah, folk get

00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:03.390
in his face sometimes, but another lesson
he's taught me that I share with you is,

00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:10.320
hey, you don't have to attend every
argument you're invited to. He lets me

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:17.160
understand what the true definition of
patriotism is. It's not how loud you sing

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:22.710
the national anthem, or the flag pin
you might have on, or or all those

00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:28.850
symbols of patriotism.
He teaches that patriotism means love of

00:19:28.850 --> 00:19:34.950
country, and you cannot love your country
unless you love your country men and

00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:37.760
women.
[APPLAUSE]

00:19:38.690 --> 00:19:45.650
You love them all, and he shows me that
you can't lead the people if you don't

00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:50.380
love the people. He, he shows me that the
best language you can speak is not

00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:54.560
mastery of the English language or
speaking another tongue. Your first

00:19:54.560 --> 00:20:03.350
language always must be kindness, and so
this to me is what power is about. But in

00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:11.090
that first meeting, we get up to leave,
and now I'm going from one side of the

00:20:11.090 --> 00:20:14.630
Capitol building to the other side of
the Capitol building to see the vice

00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:18.320
president and become a United States
senator. And somebody should fact-check

00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:22.970
me on this but I think the only time in
the history of America has a United

00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:28.070
States senator been walking to go get
sworn in and their mother was walking

00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:33.830
next to them lecturing them the entire
way. My mom's like, "Boy, don't forget where

00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:40.550
you come from. Don't forget the blood,
sweat and tears of your ancestors. Don't

00:20:40.550 --> 00:20:49.690
forget that the title does not make the
man, the man or woman must make the title."

00:20:56.480 --> 00:21:02.790
So I get sworn in. I look on both sides
of the aisle to find people in

00:21:02.790 --> 00:21:09.570
Washington that are examples to me of
what leadership is about, John Lewis and

00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:14.850
others I've now found that embody this
ideal that the world has changed as,

00:21:14.850 --> 00:21:21.510
Pablo Coelho says, the world has changed
by your example not your opinion. And I

00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:26.970
was so excited to be in this Senate and
to mix it up, to become a scrapper for

00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:31.890
the state of New Jersey, but one day I
decided to do what many senators do that

00:21:31.890 --> 00:21:38.460
have a high self regard for themselves. I
decided to write a book. With a name like

00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:45.660
mine, you've got to write a book. And so, I
promise at the corniest joke you'll hear

00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:52.260
today. And so I decided I'd go back, but
if you have a father like mine you've

00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:57.660
got to go back and fact check everything.
I mean, how big was the dog actually? And

00:21:57.660 --> 00:22:02.580
And so I start going back to try to get
the stories of my life and fact check

00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:07.140
them. And and and I go back to find the
story of me moving into New Jersey, which

00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:12.060
I told so many times. I go search for the
head of the Fair Housing Council from

00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:18.840
the 1960s. And guess what she was very
easy to find because she is still head

00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:24.240
of the North Jersey Fair Housing Council
today. Her name is Miss Lee Porter and

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:31.340
she is 92 years old, still leading the
Fair Housing movement here in New Jersey.

00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:36.390
Now she's not representing black folks,
but she's representing same-sex couples

00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:42.050
and Muslim folks who are still being
denied housing because of who they are.

00:22:42.050 --> 00:22:46.500
When I brought her to my office ,I'm not
joking, I literally got on my knees

00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:50.790
before her and thanked her. How
embarrassing and shameful in fact that I

00:22:50.790 --> 00:22:54.930
had never said thank you to the woman
who did so much for me. Every one of us

00:22:54.930 --> 00:22:59.930
here in this audience, every one of us
could probably think of people,

00:22:59.930 --> 00:23:06.270
especially on a day like this, that
deserves our gratitude. A high school

00:23:06.270 --> 00:23:10.169
teacher, a neighbor, 
someone to say thank you to.

00:23:10.169 --> 00:23:15.579
Well we started talking, and it was
amazing to me. She recounts the story. She

00:23:15.579 --> 00:23:20.019
confirms facts and details, but I want to
meet the lawyers who were involved in

00:23:20.019 --> 00:23:24.309
all of that struggle. I asked her for the
lawyer that took a punch for my family, a

00:23:24.309 --> 00:23:28.690
guy named Marty Friedman. She says I'm so
sorry but he passed away. That hurt, that

00:23:28.690 --> 00:23:32.619
I never said thank you to him, but she
says , "Look, the man who organized all of

00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:40.119
the lawyers, you can meet him. His name is
Arthur Lessman." And I found Mr. Lessman,

00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:44.140
thanks to her, and called him up. And I
said, "Sir, my name is Cory Booker." He's

00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:48.729
like, "I know who you are." And I'm like, "All
right, sir. Well you know what you did

00:23:48.729 --> 00:23:54.459
for--" "I know what I did." I said, "Okay, sir,
let me hear the story." And he tells me

00:23:54.459 --> 00:23:59.200
this incredible story, and, and it's
amazing. He confirms the fact, by the way.

00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:07.149
I found out how big the dog was. It was
not a pack of wolves. And, and then my, my

00:24:07.149 --> 00:24:11.919
heart is so shocked and moved when I end
the conversation by asking him the

00:24:11.919 --> 00:24:16.989
simple question. I mean, this blew me away.
The second half of the story I never

00:24:16.989 --> 00:24:22.179
knew. I said to him, "Sir, I need to
understand one thing." He's like, "What?"

00:24:22.179 --> 00:24:26.950
"I want to know why, why would you, at that
point in your career, you were just

00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:31.719
starting off as a lawyer. You had just
put it out a shingle. You were struggling

00:24:31.719 --> 00:24:37.659
to make it. Why would you help black
families try to move into northern New

00:24:37.659 --> 00:24:46.599
Jersey?" And the answer he gave me floored me. 
He said, "Well I remember the day that

00:24:46.599 --> 00:24:52.059
I made the decision." And I go, "The day?
What what day was it? Was it you know

00:24:52.059 --> 00:24:56.829
July this or?" No, he goes, "Cory I
remember the day. It was a Monday." And I'm

00:24:56.829 --> 00:25:02.200
like, a Monday, okay. And he goes, "I
remember it was a Monday, because the day

00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:10.690
before, on that Sunday, I was home sitting
comfortably on my couch watching TV. It was

00:25:10.690 --> 00:25:15.579
a Sunday evening movie.
I actually know the name of the movie. It

00:25:15.579 --> 00:25:21.830
was 'Judgment at Nuremburg.'"
Now this was back in the days when we

00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:27.290
had like three and a half channels on a
TV. You had to get up and change the

00:25:27.290 --> 00:25:31.850
remote, change without a remote, change it
with your hands. And he's sitting

00:25:31.850 --> 00:25:37.100
comfortably on his couch in Bergen
County, New Jersey, watching TV and then

00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:43.940
suddenly something rare happens. They
broke away from the movie to cover the

00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:54.260
news. And and what they covered was they
went straight to Alabama because these

00:25:54.260 --> 00:26:02.300
marchers had started in Selma, led by a
20-something-year-old young man named

00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:08.630
John Lewis. And they had tried to march
to Montgomery in protest of a murder of

00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:13.490
an African-American man and voting
rights. And they got trapped and stopped

00:26:13.490 --> 00:26:18.080
on this bridge by a line of Alabama
state troopers. And he said he watched in

00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:22.070
horror how these folks stood there and
they decided that they would turn around

00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:28.820
but first they would pray. And he said
just as they got down to kneel and pray

00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:36.650
suddenly the Alabama state troopers shot
gas in on them. He went from watching

00:26:36.650 --> 00:26:42.110
"Judgment at Nuremburg" to his own country
as people had teargas raining down on

00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:46.670
them and they got raced in by these
Alabama state troopers with billy clubs.

00:26:46.670 --> 00:26:51.800
And he watched with horror Miss Boyton
beaten over the head, falling to her face.

00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:57.410
Others, John Lewis head cracked open. He
said he watched in horror that this was

00:26:57.410 --> 00:27:05.240
happening, his nation. And it was just too
much. He, he couldn't just get up, and got

00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:09.920
up in a state of sedentary agitation
where he was so upset about what he was

00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:14.270
watching on TV but didn't do anything
about it. So he went to work the next day

00:27:14.270 --> 00:27:18.980
on Monday and sat down with the only
other lawyer that was there, which was

00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:25.340
his partner Leo. And the two of them sat
there and he said to Leo, "We got to

00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:30.350
go to Alabama." And and Leo laughed, not
because it was funny, but because it was

00:27:30.350 --> 00:27:34.879
preposterous. They couldn't 
afford a plane ticket. They

00:27:34.879 --> 00:27:39.769
couldn't even afford to close the doors
to their business one day. They were

00:27:39.769 --> 00:27:44.539
struggling to make it and frustrated.
They just sat there for a little while

00:27:44.539 --> 00:27:49.549
and then suddenly, in essence, they
thought to themselves and said, why don't

00:27:49.549 --> 00:27:58.279
we just do the best we can, with what we
have, where we are? And they got on the

00:27:58.279 --> 00:28:02.330
phone and started calling around, and
they found this young woman with a small

00:28:02.330 --> 00:28:05.749
organization called the Fair Housing
Council. They were calling around to see

00:28:05.749 --> 00:28:09.109
who might need lawyers, and when they
called her, she was like, "Oh thank you

00:28:09.109 --> 00:28:14.059
Jesus thank you thank you.
I need lawyers." And they started to get

00:28:14.059 --> 00:28:21.769
working. That was 1965. Well, four years
later they get a case file, he gets a

00:28:21.769 --> 00:28:26.749
case file handed to him with the two
names on it, Carrie and Carolyn Booker, my

00:28:26.749 --> 00:28:34.519
parents. I've been thinking these years
so often about that moment on that couch

00:28:34.519 --> 00:28:39.609
when you're comfortable, that moment in
their office. I think about that moment

00:28:39.609 --> 00:28:48.799
and how these folks did not allow their
inability to do everything to undermine

00:28:48.799 --> 00:28:52.839
their determination to do something.

00:28:56.700 --> 00:29:02.730
How they didn't surrender to this idea
that, aw, look at these powerful people

00:29:02.730 --> 00:29:08.190
in powerful places, the governor of
Alabama saying segregation now

00:29:08.190 --> 00:29:11.700
segregation. Oh they didn't just sit
there and look at the powerful people

00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:21.240
saying powerful words and surrender their strength. 
How they in that one,

00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:28.140
small moment, they understood that to do
nothing is not only to surrender your

00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:35.220
power, but to do nothing is actually to
contribute to the very injustices that

00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:45.150
you're witnessing. That in so many ways,
the opposite of justice is not injustice.

00:29:45.150 --> 00:29:51.180
It is inaction. It is apathy. It is
silence. They understood that it's not

00:29:51.180 --> 00:30:00.980
enough to say I am NOT a bigot. It is so
important to say I am an agent of love.

00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:08.880
It is so important not just to say I am
NOT hateful. You have to be an agent of

00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:16.010
love. It is not enough to say I am not
sexist, I am NOT homophobic, I am not

00:30:16.010 --> 00:30:22.860
cruel or mean. It must be an activist
decision that you make and it not need

00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:30.480
not be big. One decision in a world where
we are so more intricately interwoven

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:38.570
than we know, one decision by one person
on one day, ripples out into community.

00:30:38.570 --> 00:30:45.570
That patriotism of the people on the
bridge, the love of country, which means

00:30:45.570 --> 00:30:51.090
you love all your country men and women,
that love on that bridge, one day people

00:30:51.090 --> 00:30:58.680
whose names I don't know, standing up
unleashed that force of love into the

00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:04.680
world and it instantaneously jumped
1,000 miles and changed the heart of one

00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:09.140
man sitting comfortably on a couch in
New Jersey who would then go all

00:31:09.140 --> 00:31:15.440
with his patriotism, with his love, with
his activism small acts volunteering on

00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:21.380
the weekends. He would go on to change
generations yet unborn. I would not be

00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:27.680
here today if it wasn't for that chain
reaction of love built on one action on

00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:40.280
one day, one person to another person. It
is a virtuous virus. It's a cascade of

00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:46.340
love that we all have the power to do.
Never forget that the biggest thing you

00:31:46.340 --> 00:31:55.250
can do on most every day is often just a
small act of kindness, decency, love, and

00:31:55.250 --> 00:32:07.690
caring. And so to the great Class of 2018
I say again from where I started, you are

00:32:07.690 --> 00:32:16.060
powerful. Power is not on how physically
strong you are. It's on how morally

00:32:16.060 --> 00:32:26.540
consistent you are. You are powerful.
Power does not come from your title. It

00:32:26.540 --> 00:32:32.750
comes from you telling your truth every
single day in your smallest of actions.

00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:37.370
What you decide to do with the dollars
you spend, how you notice the dignity of

00:32:37.370 --> 00:32:41.990
the person on the street, how you give
one act of kindness more than you

00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:51.500
thought,
2018 you are powerful. And I am telling

00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:59.580
you right now, if you show up, 
if you show up every day,

00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:05.890
no matter what's on the news, no matter
what someone in power said, if you show

00:33:05.890 --> 00:33:15.370
up, and you give a little, care a little,
help a little, heal a little, listen a

00:33:15.370 --> 00:33:24.430
little, love a little, every single day, if
you don't let the darkness of the world

00:33:24.430 --> 00:33:30.190
snuff out your lights, if you don't let
the hatred of another make you cynical,

00:33:30.190 --> 00:33:38.410
and turn your back. If you live a life
committed to being powerful, on a daily

00:33:38.410 --> 00:33:44.380
basis, to being powerful hour to hour, with
accepting your responsibility, with being

00:33:44.380 --> 00:33:51.880
an agent, then you will make your
ancestors proud. Because today I am

00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:59.140
telling you, you are your ancestors'
wildest dreams. But for the dream to

00:33:59.140 --> 00:34:06.310
truly be real, for the dream and hope of
this country that is in the balance in

00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:13.720
this moral moment, it's gonna take an
awful lot of power. So my hope today is

00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:24.460
that you leave here and be powerful. Let
this world feel you every day. Walk into

00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:34.750
every room, go to every place and embrace
the world with your spirit and with your

00:34:34.750 --> 00:34:42.970
truth. And if you do that, if you live
that way, if you strut like you are

00:34:42.970 --> 00:34:50.350
powerful, then I promise you the
generations yet unborn will know of your

00:34:50.350 --> 00:34:57.690
light and your love. Thank you very much.
Thank you. [APPLAUSE]

00:35:51.050 --> 00:35:57.540
Thank you so much, Senator Booker, for
helping to lead the Class of 2018 off on

00:35:57.540 --> 00:36:03.510
a high note. Your commitment to serving
ordinary people in the midst of trying

00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:09.420
circumstances serves as an example to
all of us as to how to navigate our life

00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:15.329
after Princeton with integrity and
purpose. For these reasons, on behalf of

00:36:15.329 --> 00:36:21.990
the class, we are proud to induct you
into the great Class of 2018, so we

00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:24.740
welcome you.
[APPLAUSE]
