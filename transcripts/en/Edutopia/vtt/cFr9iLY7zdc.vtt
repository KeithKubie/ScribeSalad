00:00:00.516 --> 00:00:01.966
&gt;&gt;Guys, I know.

00:00:01.966 --> 00:00:03.056
Just take a deep breath, you guys.

00:00:03.236 --> 00:00:04.296
Give us a few minutes, okay?

00:00:04.366 --> 00:00:05.376
Justin, can you stop, please?

00:00:05.926 --> 00:00:06.856
Okay. Ladies and gentlemen!

00:00:06.966 --> 00:00:08.946
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Having trouble
managing your classroom?

00:00:10.356 --> 00:00:12.746
Here are some of our
favorite tricks of the trade.

00:00:13.276 --> 00:00:14.586
&gt;&gt;All right.

00:00:14.626 --> 00:00:15.666
We're going to come to this table.

00:00:15.706 --> 00:00:16.546
Please push in your chairs.

00:00:16.616 --> 00:00:17.886
Come on around.

00:00:17.996 --> 00:00:19.096
Remember, give them space.

00:00:19.276 --> 00:00:21.366
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Chris Opitz
creates a fishbowl

00:00:21.516 --> 00:00:25.046
so that students can learn lessons
in manners and math from each other.

00:00:25.046 --> 00:00:26.546
&gt;&gt;Chris: Audience,
our voices are off.

00:00:26.876 --> 00:00:29.506
We're just going to look for evidence
of a really great discussion,

00:00:29.506 --> 00:00:31.216
and then we're going to
talk about that afterwards.

00:00:31.426 --> 00:00:36.606
&gt;&gt;I began using the fishbowl having
kids really closely observe other

00:00:36.606 --> 00:00:40.496
kids in discussion identifying
particular types of language,

00:00:40.716 --> 00:00:45.036
ways to ask questions, how to
use manners when disagreeing,

00:00:45.236 --> 00:00:46.756
and once that foundation is built,

00:00:47.206 --> 00:00:50.246
then the academics can be
so much more thoughtful.

00:00:50.246 --> 00:00:51.576
&gt;&gt;Mike started with 8.

00:00:51.616 --> 00:00:56.886
Kelly had twice as much as Mike,
and Joe had half as much as Kelly.

00:00:57.206 --> 00:00:59.636
&gt;&gt;Chris: Every teacher out there has
probably said at some point in time,

00:00:59.636 --> 00:01:01.256
"Turn to your neighbor
and talk about this idea.

00:01:01.616 --> 00:01:04.826
Look at your teammates
and talk about this idea."

00:01:05.006 --> 00:01:06.166
&gt;&gt;Why did you do those shapes?

00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:07.996
&gt;&gt;Chris: And really watch.

00:01:08.296 --> 00:01:11.826
If they are talking about the topic
that you've asked them to talk about,

00:01:12.106 --> 00:01:15.356
if they're actually listening to
each other and using that language

00:01:15.356 --> 00:01:18.256
and those social skills, then all
of a sudden, you have an environment

00:01:18.456 --> 00:01:22.406
where 30 kids are all
learning at the same time.

00:01:22.456 --> 00:01:25.546
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Share one of your tricks
with fellow teachers on Edutopia.
