00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.680
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:26.020
&gt;&gt; Dan Morgenstern: This
is a kind of a reunion

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:31.410
because Abdullah Ibrahim and
I have not seen each other

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.690
in a very long time.

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:42.190
But we do go back to New York
where he had recently arrived,

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:47.450
and we did manage to spend
some time together there.

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:52.330
And it was wonderful to see
you again, looking great

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:56.360
and sounding marvelous, there
was a concert last night

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.950
of your trio, which was beautiful.

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:04.480
And we've had a chance to talk a
while and reminisce a little bit

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:09.410
and I think what we're
going to do now is to find

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:15.430 position:56%
out about all the things that you've
been up to since then [laughter],

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.210
which would probably
take us about a year and.

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:25.900
But to begin with, I
remember that one of the thing

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.920
that we did together was a concert
at, in the garden at the Museum

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.100
of Modern Art in New York.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.370
And that was a great evening,

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:41.350
and I'm sure that you remember
a little bit about that.

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:42.920
&gt;&gt; Abdullah Ibrahim: Yes, I do.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.480
And Dan, thank you.

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:53.390
It's great to see you again,
and you are looking very well.

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.350
Always fond memories, and
my deepest appreciation

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.700
because when I first
came to New York,

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:06.350
you really supported
me like 100 percent.

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:14.290
And I'll always remember
that, very, very kind of you.

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.690
I remember this concert
very vaguely [laughter].

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.340
&gt;&gt; Dan Morgenstern: Yeah, it
was with the Choir of Lancaster.

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.820
&gt;&gt; Abdullah Ibrahim:
Oh [inaudible], yeah!

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.340
&gt;&gt; Dan Morgenstern: And
Morris [assumed spelling],

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:35.320
who was a fellow South African,
and Sonny Brown was the drummer.

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:36.620
&gt;&gt; Abdullah Ibrahim: Yeah.

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.630
&gt;&gt; Dan Morgenstern: And
I found their review

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:45.380
from Down Beat way back, and let's
see, Junior Booth was the bassist.

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.220
&gt;&gt; Abdullah Ibrahim:
Junior Booth, yeah.

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.160
He just, he just arrived in New
York shortly He was from Buffalo.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.530
Great bass player.

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:01.470
Alright. You know, I remember that,
and then I went on to form a trio

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:07.010
with the Bad Lancaster and
Kello Scott [assumed spelling],

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.310
the cellist.

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.620
&gt;&gt; Dan Morgenstern: Oh, Kello Oh,
he was a wonderful player, yeah.

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.680
Yeah, he just made a handful
of records, not enough.

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.790
And people don't know
about him anymore, no.

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.090
&gt;&gt; Abdullah Ibrahim: No.

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.020 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Dan Morgenstern: And that was
such an unusual instrument and, and.

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:30.510
&gt;&gt; Abdullah Ibrahim: Of course, you
know, cello, and I was interested

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.750
in playing cello since I was a kid.

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.880
When I got to New York, I got a
little cello and started playing.

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:44.280
But then, I met Kello, and Kello
also introduced us to kodaly.

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:50.200
And of course, kodaly cello
suites, really resonates with,

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.530
also with our dynamic
of our understanding,

00:03:53.530 --> 00:04:00.770
how can we expand the harmonic
and rhythmic possibilities.

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:06.160
So I formed a trio with Bad
Lancaster on bass clarinet,

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:11.650
and Kello on cello,
and myself on piano.

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:16.900
And then I went to a New York
club, I can't remember where he was

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.370
and I said, would you like
to book me, I've got a trio?

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.970
They said fine, but when we
pieced off the other night,

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:27.720
they didn't want to play me,
because that's not a trio.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.050
You see a trio is bass,
drums [laughter].

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:40.050
So it took me 50, 60
years to create it again,

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.230
and that was the unit
that we saw last night.

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:44.530
&gt;&gt; Dan Morgenstern: Yes.

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:47.560
&gt;&gt; Abdullah Ibrahim:
This was the idea.

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.510
&gt;&gt; Dan Morgenstern: That was a,
it's a beautiful combination.

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:53.930
It really, it's a special sound

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:58.430
because there is doubling
and [inaudible].

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:01.990
We heard quite a bit of piccolo.

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:03.290
&gt;&gt; Abdullah Ibrahim: Piccolo.

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:04.960
&gt;&gt; Dan Morgenstern: Which is an
instrument you don't encounter too

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.020
often, I guess, and he
played it beautifully.

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.200
&gt;&gt; Abdullah Ibrahim: Incredible,
incredible, wonderful player.

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:21.350 position:56%
And also Cliff Guyton, flute player,
cello, and clarinet, and piccolo.

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:25.420
The cello and bass
player, Noah Jackson,

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:27.880
this is his first gig
out of college.

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:29.180
&gt;&gt; Dan Morgenstern: Really?

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:33.860
&gt;&gt; Abdullah Ibrahim: He came out
of college last year and joined us,

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:40.790
and quite, I think there's
a, the younger generation of,

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:47.620
of musicians who, technically
skilled, but also have the passion,

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:51.270
and also lock into the tradition.

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:54.070
&gt;&gt; Dan Morgenstern: Well he's a
fine cellist and it's interesting.

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:58.040
Again, usually when the
cello was used in jazz,

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:01.140
it was pizzicato, [inaudible].

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:03.500
&gt;&gt; Abdullah Ibrahim:
[inaudible] yeah.

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:05.360
Yeah, Kello Scott [assumed
spelling] at that time told me,

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:10.060
he said he'd play it amplified.

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:15.870
He amplified the cello and slung
it, and then stood up with it.

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:19.010
So I ask him to tell
me, why do you do this?

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:22.700
And he said, "I wanted to get
away from the drummer" [laughter].

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:32.330
Because the only place you're right
to the drummer and amplify it.

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:36.460
&gt;&gt; Dan Morgenstern: I saw Kello, I
think not with you unfortunately,

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:40.530
but I saw him live
once at the Half Note,

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:43.650
which was a nice club in downtown.

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:46.440
&gt;&gt; Abdullah Ibrahim: Yeah,
I remember the Half Note.

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:48.580
&gt;&gt; Dan Morgenstern: They
had very good food too,

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:50.390
which was unusual [inaudible]

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:54.860
At the Velvet Shrinegard
[phonetic], they had nothing.

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:57.280
&gt;&gt; Abdullah Ibrahim: Exactly.

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:01.090
&gt;&gt; Dan Morgenstern: So,
how long did you stay

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:04.750 position:56%
in New York at that time in the 60s?

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:06.590
&gt;&gt; Abdullah Ibrahim: It
was quite a long time.

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:14.730
We stayed at least
thirty, thirty years,

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:18.230
thirty years at various,
various places.

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:26.660 position:56%
But then we ended up at the
Chelsea Hotel, that's where we ended

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:32.570
up staying for quite a
long time with [inaudible].

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:40.950 position:56%
And I had come from Cape Town to New
York like a scouting party to come

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:45.770
and look for accomodation, you
see, and the family would follow.

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:48.410
And then Don Cherry [assumed
spelling] introduced me

00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:55.360
to [inaudible], who was the
manager of the Chelsea Hotel,

00:07:55.360 --> 00:08:04.920
and that's where we stayed
at a colony of artists.

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:09.010
&gt;&gt; Dan Morgenstern: Yes, the
Chelsea was a famous hotel on 23rd.

00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:10.310
&gt;&gt; Abdullah Ibrahim:
23rd street, yeah.

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:15.520
But before it was because the
children had to go to school,

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:22.030
it was a walk away, anywhere that
you wanted to go, you want to go

00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:24.050
down to the village, yeah.

00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:26.280
&gt;&gt; Dan Morgenstern: That's a good
location, and then as you say,

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:28.350
you know, a lot of
artists lived there.

00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:29.650
&gt;&gt; Abdullah Ibrahim: Yeah.

00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:30.950
&gt;&gt; Dan Morgenstern:
Interesting people.

00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:33.380
And it was more or less
of a residential hotel.

00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:34.680
&gt;&gt; Abdullah Ibrahim: It
was residential, yeah.

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:40.540
And then a few years, over two or
three years ago, it all changed

00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:43.650
when it changed ownership.

00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:52.160
Yeah so then, we had to move out.

00:08:55.450 --> 00:08:58.090
&gt;&gt; Dan Morgenstern: But then,

00:08:58.090 --> 00:09:03.200
it took some time before
you went back home.

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:08.710
&gt;&gt; Abdullah Ibrahim: Yeah,
I went back shortly in 70,

00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:17.440
74 and then it became like most,
for most of us during that time,

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:19.660
it became totally unbearable.

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:22.740
Because it was very,
very suppressive.

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:28.800
And then we left, and
then didn't return

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:36.340
until Mandela was released
from prison in 98.

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:38.270
&gt;&gt; Dan Morgenstern:
And you performed

00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:41.000
at Nelson Mandela's inauguration.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.300
&gt;&gt; Abdullah Ibrahim: Yeah.

00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:43.600
&gt;&gt; Dan Morgenstern:
What was that like?

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:46.450
That must have been special.

00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:53.010
&gt;&gt; Abdullah Ibrahim: Thing that
I remember most that we had this,

00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:57.870
it was only like unconscious fear

00:09:57.870 --> 00:09:59.770
that we were not supposed
to be there, you know?

00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:03.430
Because it happens to
all of us, so suddenly.

00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:09.380
A place like Pretoria, where you'll
even be weary during those years

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:12.440
to walk, to walk the streets.

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:19.830
And it was, it was exhilarating
and it was something confusing also

00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:22.830
because it was too much
to handle [laughter].

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:24.760 position:56%
Too much to handle at the same time,

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:29.500
but the inauguration was very
remarkable because there were close

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:32.350
to a million people
at the Union Building.

00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:37.410
So we never could go, I never went.

00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:45.620
And for me, I mean, it went
on for hours and hours,

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:51.080
I met all the musicians and
other artists who performed.

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:58.410
But the display was incredible,
because it was a military display

00:10:58.410 --> 00:11:04.860
of strength, and just to
see how they then managed

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:10.420
to handle this transition
without major conflict.

00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:17.060
&gt;&gt; Dan Morgenstern: Yeah well there
have been some tremendous changes

00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:20.110
there over your lifetime.

00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:21.410
&gt;&gt; Abdullah Ibrahim: Yes.

00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:28.880
Those are, we always
understood that the period

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:35.720
after the change would
be very, very difficult.

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:44.560
And there's some of the
problems that we face now.

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:48.590
Because in some ways, we were not,

00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:56.820
we didn't prepare ourselves
to handle it properly.

00:11:56.820 --> 00:12:04.020
But I'm quite amazing, in
spite of all the negativity,

00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:08.740
there are people there
who are unsung

00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:14.380
and working behind the
scenes, very dedicated,

00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:20.200 position:56%
and also very knowledgeable, and
also have the vision for the people.

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:26.190
So we are, we're hopeful.

00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:31.320
&gt;&gt; Dan Morgenstern: You make
your home now in Cape Town,

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:36.610
is that where you have your
sort of main residence?

00:12:36.610 --> 00:12:39.190
Because you travel so much.

00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:42.950
&gt;&gt; Abdullah Ibrahim: Right now,
I'm at the Hyatt [laughter],

00:12:42.950 --> 00:12:55.690 position:56%
Hyatt Regency Washington, but I have
a base with my fiancé in Germany.

00:12:55.690 --> 00:12:56.990
&gt;&gt; Dan Morgenstern: Where?

00:12:56.990 --> 00:12:58.290
&gt;&gt; Abdullah Ibrahim: Chiemsee.

00:12:58.290 --> 00:13:03.790
&gt;&gt; Dan Morgenstern:
Chiemsee is beautiful.

00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:08.370
My grandmother had a place
not far from Chiemsee.

00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:12.130
So I knew that region,
when I was a child.

00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:13.430
Yeah.

00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:16.460
&gt;&gt; Abdullah Ibrahim: Yeah
well, quite, quite beautiful.

00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:19.190
So my fiancee, Dr Marina O
Marie [assumed spelling],

00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:23.020
she's a medical doctor.

00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:27.320
And so she invited me to come

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:30.500
because at some point I
had a illness that I had

00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:33.970
to go ahead to deal with.

00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:41.040
And through her assistance
the problem was solved.

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:43.960
And this is one of the reasons why
I live there, the other reason was

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:48.480
that most of the work at
that time was in Europe.

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:51.560
So to commute from
South Africa to Europe

00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:54.700
in the Northern Hemisphere
was a bit tricky.

00:13:54.700 --> 00:14:07.430
And also, my dream in [inaudible],
of course, when European is in,

00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:13.430
you've got an instrument like
that, you have to have hope.

00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:20.440
And so Fazioli [assumed spelling]
factory, is about four hours drive

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:22.200
from where we are [inaudible].

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:27.020
So it's just across the border.

00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:36.260 position:56%
So I know Paulos, from very first
years when he started playing piano.

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:43.090 position:56%
So he invited me to his factory, I
did a concert there and then I said,

00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:45.310
okay, let me try and
buy an instrument,

00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:46.880
but now you must have
a home to put it.

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:53.870
So that's why I'm in
Chiemsee, beautiful instrument.

00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:57.500
&gt;&gt; Dan Morgenstern: I don't
think I've ever seen one,

00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:00.680
they're not mass manufactured,
I think.

00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:09.030
&gt;&gt; Abdullah Ibrahim: No, he is a,
I think he creates about 100 or 50

00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:15.640
or 75, but it takes time to mature.

00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:24.080
It's very meticulous on the sound,
and the materials that he uses.

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:28.180
And the instrument is very,
it's an incredible instrument,

00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:31.750
one of the instrument that
really resonates with you.

00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:35.980
You don't have to fight with it.

00:15:37.090 --> 00:15:41.460
&gt;&gt; Dan Morgenstern: Well, I can
imagine that that is very important

00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:46.680
to you because you get such a
beautiful sound from the piano.

00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:50.830
You have a very special
touch and you, you know,

00:15:50.830 --> 00:15:57.860
you just create a very special kind
of feeling from that instrument.

00:15:57.860 --> 00:16:02.050
Some people use it vey precursiely,

00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:10.470
but you have a really
beautiful, almost romantic way.

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:16.110
&gt;&gt; Abdullah Ibrahim:
Oh, thank you very much.

00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:19.710
[Inaudible] it comes,
it comes through,

00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:22.510
through trial, trial and error.

00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:35.270
Which is what, what is the best
method to, to transmit what you,

00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:37.060
what you're really feeling?

00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:44.360
And I discovered that if you just
work acoustically with the sound

00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:50.960
in the venue, instead of
amplifying everything first.

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:57.660
If we play bigger concerts,
for example, with a group,

00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:03.060
I suggest to the sound engineers
that we first play acoustically.

00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:07.850 position:56%
And we can hear each other on stage,
and then transport this into the,

00:17:07.850 --> 00:17:11.220
you know, into the whole And
[inaudible] sense of technique

00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:13.430
that I can, I can actually hear,

00:17:13.430 --> 00:17:17.600
at what level of volume I should
strike the note for it to reach,

00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:21.570
you know, to fill the space.

00:17:21.570 --> 00:17:22.870
&gt;&gt; Dan Morgenstern: Well,

00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:28.070
it's started with so much music
is over-amplified these days.

00:17:28.070 --> 00:17:36.010
And unnecessarily, I mean
there are clubs in New York

00:17:36.010 --> 00:17:44.320
where you could hear perfectly
well without, you know,

00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:47.740
having a bunch of microphones
on stage.

00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:54.220
But they always put them there,
and once they amplify the drums,

00:17:54.220 --> 00:18:00.440
then they have to amplify
everything else [laughter].

00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:07.110
I once did something, I had a very
short career as a concert producer.

00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:10.350
It wasn't anything that I did
primarily, but [inaudible]

00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:14.620
with George Wayne who asked
me to do a few things.

00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:18.360
And I wanted there because
Carnegie Hall has such great sound.

00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:19.660
&gt;&gt; Abdullah Ibrahim: Yeah.

00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:22.630
&gt;&gt; Dan Morgenstern: And
when Stan gets played there,

00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:26.300
sure thing he said,
turn off the mic.

00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:32.160
Everybody would, you know, looked
at each other, what does he mean?

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:33.460
[inaudible]

00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:34.760
&gt;&gt; Abdullah Ibrahim: Yeah.

00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:39.960
So I got the idea doing a duet
at a concert of acoustic duets

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:45.530
at Carnegie Hall, and it
came out quite nicely.

00:18:45.530 --> 00:18:47.940
Abdullah Ibrahim Yeah.

00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:52.130 position:56%
So far as we normally play acoustic,

00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:56.860
if it's a larger venue then we ask
the engineer just to put a touch

00:18:56.860 --> 00:19:02.940
of it on, and work
from the natural sound.

00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:07.710
Sometimes the engineers have
to earn their keep, you see.

00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:09.870
So they have to be seen [laughter].

00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:19.840
&gt;&gt; Dan Morgenstern: They don't want
to be made obsolete, of course.

00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:25.070
So, you spent some time at
the Library of Congress,

00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:27.140
which is where we are now.

00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:29.090
Did you find it interesting?

00:19:29.090 --> 00:19:32.410
&gt;&gt; Abdullah Ibrahim: Quite
amazing, kind of amazing.

00:19:32.410 --> 00:19:42.190
I had no, I had no idea the scope
and quality, it's quite something,

00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:44.600
I was totally, totally blown away.

00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:51.170
And of course, looking over
at Larry, he introduced me,

00:19:51.170 --> 00:19:57.010
and then took out some of the,
you know, the scores and charts.

00:19:57.010 --> 00:20:02.050
You see that some of them I've been
trying to track down for some time.

00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:04.130
Remember I've been looking

00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:10.010
at the Ellington's turquoise,
on a turquoise cloud.

00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:17.230
And, so, Larry showed
me, showed me the charts.

00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:22.690
And incredibly, you know, you
remember that Ellington asked me

00:20:22.690 --> 00:20:27.210
to work tempo music in New York.

00:20:27.210 --> 00:20:32.820
He asked me to help pull it, pull
the publishing company together.

00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:38.870
And also I used to transcribe
some of his, some of the music.

00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:44.030 position:56%
The Virgin Island suite, when it
came back from, they just had tapes.

00:20:44.030 --> 00:20:49.030
You see, so I transcribed it,
and then submitted it, you see.

00:20:49.030 --> 00:20:52.840
And then I hd some of
my own compositions.

00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:58.280 position:56%
So when Larry pulled this Ellington,
they were my transcription.

00:20:58.280 --> 00:20:59.580
&gt;&gt; Dan Morgenstern:
My transcription.

00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:03.570
&gt;&gt; Abdullah Ibrahim There all
so, and you feel quite honored.

00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:07.230
&gt;&gt; Dan Morgenstern:
That's fascinating

00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:13.560
and it's completely off tempo,
but just about two weeks ago,

00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:18.400
I re-listened to that Virgin Island
suite for the first time in years.

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:19.700
&gt;&gt; Abdullah Ibrahim:
Really [laughter]

00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:22.980
&gt;&gt; Dan Morgenstern: Maybe
I had a premonition.

00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:29.420
&gt;&gt; Abdullah Ibrahim: I
remember, where was it again?

00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:34.170
And Larry showed me the
address also of tempo music

00:21:34.170 --> 00:21:37.000
But his sister was running,
it was in his sister's house.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:38.300
In Ruth's house.

00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:39.600
&gt;&gt; Dan Morgenstern: Yeah.

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:44.360
Did you ever visit Ruth in
her apartment in New York?

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:47.210
&gt;&gt; Abdullah Ibrahim: That's
where the publishing company was.

00:21:47.210 --> 00:21:48.510
&gt;&gt; Dan Morgenstern:
Everything was white.

00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:49.810 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Abdullah Ibrahim: Yes [laughter].

00:21:49.810 --> 00:21:51.210
&gt;&gt; Dan Morgenstern: It
was an amazing place,

00:21:51.210 --> 00:21:52.510
on Central Park South.

00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:55.190
&gt;&gt; Abdullah Ibrahim: Exactly.

00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:59.650
And for me, it was
wonderful to be there,

00:21:59.650 --> 00:22:01.410
because I could really access some

00:22:01.410 --> 00:22:06.920
of Ellington's music,
scores, first-hand.

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:10.570
And of course it gave
me a good schooling

00:22:10.570 --> 00:22:14.930
in the business of publishing.

00:22:14.930 --> 00:22:18.960
&gt;&gt; Dan Morgenstern: You met
Ellington in Switzerland, right?

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:20.260
&gt;&gt; Abdullah Ibrahim:
Switzerland, yeah.

00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:27.650
We were playing in this
little club, and we met a lot

00:22:27.650 --> 00:22:32.150
of American musicians because
they passed through on concerts.

00:22:32.150 --> 00:22:37.200
I met Gana [phonetic],
the Messengers,

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:39.640
that's when I first
met Wayne Shorter.

00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:45.900
A lot of them came
through, Coltrane.

00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:50.330
And the, but this club
that we played in,

00:22:50.330 --> 00:22:52.710
we knew that Ellington was coming.

00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:59.170
The club owner didn't want
to let us, let us off.

00:22:59.170 --> 00:23:06.310
So Sathima went to the concert,
and we had finished, in fact,

00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:13.050
the club owner was just
locking up when Sathima arrives

00:23:13.050 --> 00:23:15.220
with Ellington and his entourage.

00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:16.520
&gt;&gt; Dan Morgenstern: Wow.

00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:18.500
&gt;&gt; Abdullah Ibrahim: I don't
know today how she managed.

00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:20.780
What did she say to Ellington?

00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:23.490
But he came and, okay,
we went in the trio.

00:23:23.490 --> 00:23:26.220
And I was asked to play,
and we played a few pieces.

00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:35.690
And then a few days later he
took us to Paris to record.

00:23:35.690 --> 00:23:37.990
He was ANR man for a [inaudible].

00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:39.330
Frank Sinatra.

00:23:39.330 --> 00:23:41.040
&gt;&gt; Dan Morgenstern: Right.

00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:42.340
Right.

00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:43.910
&gt;&gt; Abdullah Ibrahim: It was
incredible because when we got

00:23:43.910 --> 00:23:47.810 position:56%
into the studio, he said to Sathima.

00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:49.380
So what do you do?

00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:50.770
And she said, I sing.

00:23:50.770 --> 00:23:53.800
And he said okay, we'll
start with you.

00:23:53.800 --> 00:24:03.190
And that's how we recorded, it was
recorded in the afternoon in Paris.

00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:05.840
Which was then later,
later released.

00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:08.800
It was not released
in the same time,

00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:13.760
when my recording was released.

00:24:15.010 --> 00:24:18.400
A learning experience.

00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:23.190
&gt;&gt; Dan Morgenstern: Ellington
was an amazing man wasn't he?

00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:26.180
He was just.

00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:31.740
&gt;&gt; Abdullah Ibrahim: Yeah he
was a, always, always remind me

00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:35.830 position:56%
of this wise old men in the village.

00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:39.600
You have to watch what you say.

00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:41.910
Like Mandela.

00:24:41.910 --> 00:24:50.710
I was [inaudible] with Mandela,
when you apt not to say anything.

00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:54.540
And when you start saying it, you
realize that you put your foot

00:24:54.540 --> 00:24:56.130
in your mouth [laughter].

00:24:56.130 --> 00:25:00.950
Because the old [inaudible]
and Ellington,

00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:07.730
almost like the seven
sense of understanding,

00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:13.470
or almost like foreseeing.

00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:21.320
And I think it's maybe it's a
quality that we try to develop

00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:25.620
as jazz musicians, this
almost anticipation,

00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:29.030
not just in the music,
but in one's life.

00:25:29.030 --> 00:25:39.440
To develop this propensity to see
in others what is deeply embedded,

00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:43.280
and how we can resonate with such.

00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:46.920
And Ellington was a master,
he was a master at that.

00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:50.220
And also his response, you
know, how he would respond

00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:53.550
to a situation was quite masterful.

00:25:53.550 --> 00:25:56.570
&gt;&gt; Dan Morgenstern: Yeah,
he knew how to bring

00:25:56.570 --> 00:26:02.120
out the special quality
in a musician.

00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:03.420
&gt;&gt; Abdullah Ibrahim: Yea.

00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:05.870
&gt;&gt; Dan Morgenstern: Some
cases once they left him,

00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:08.320
they never recaptured that.

00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:11.360
&gt;&gt; Abdullah Ibrahim:
Yeah, from that.

00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:14.060
Yeah, one of the things
that I learned from him is

00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:27.450
that when I saw writing for why the
instrument's wider than the piano.

00:26:27.450 --> 00:26:33.390
So you actually, you
write for the musician.

00:26:33.390 --> 00:26:37.260
So you, that specific
ability or specific

00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:40.430
that specific sonority
that a musician has.

00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:45.290
And then write the song for
that specific individual,

00:26:45.290 --> 00:26:46.700
instead of the other way round.

00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:49.130
Instead of just writing
music, and at the same time,

00:26:49.130 --> 00:26:51.450
people that have to play it.

00:26:51.450 --> 00:26:57.460 position:56%
And I think this is why he had this,
and of course, the great thing is,

00:26:57.460 --> 00:27:01.110
was, that he had the
orchestra at his fingertips.

00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:06.260 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Dan Morgenstern: Well that's why,
you know, he kept that orchestra,

00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:09.520
even though it, you know,
it cost him a fortune.

00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:14.920
And he kept them on salary
even when they were not working

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:18.260
because he wanted that to be there

00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:22.810
when he had music that
he wanted to hear.

00:27:22.810 --> 00:27:24.650
And we're lucky that he did that.

00:27:24.650 --> 00:27:28.940
And of course when he wasn't
recording for a label,

00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:31.630
he recorded stuff for himself.

00:27:31.630 --> 00:27:39.750
We have that whole
treasure trove of things.

00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:46.520 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Abdullah Ibrahim: How do you
manage to keep these great musicians

00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:49.240
with you such a long time?

00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:53.380
So, [inaudible] I've got a gimmick.

00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:54.930
I give them money [laughter].

00:27:54.930 --> 00:28:03.970 position:56%
And then be with them at the studio.

00:28:03.970 --> 00:28:07.130
Because they paid them
out of his own,

00:28:07.130 --> 00:28:14.000
out of his own, out
of his own pocket.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.480
&gt;&gt; Dan Morgenstern: There's a
big literature about Ellington,

00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:21.050 position:56%
of course, and there's a recent
book I don't know if you've seen it,

00:28:21.050 --> 00:28:24.120
but Terry Teachout about Duke,

00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:30.040
and it's become quite
controversial with Ellington fans.

00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:32.060
And I think rightly so.

00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:34.220
Because among other things,

00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:41.460
he says that Ellington was really
not a very good piano player,

00:28:41.460 --> 00:28:46.230
I mean he was okay, but he was
no more than sort of mediocre.

00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:51.330
Which is such a idiotic
thing to say, you know?

00:28:51.330 --> 00:28:54.860
Because the sound alone
that he got out it.

00:28:54.860 --> 00:28:56.160
&gt;&gt; Abdullah Ibrahim: Yea.

00:28:56.160 --> 00:29:02.940
I mean, listening to, listening
to Ellington and, like you say,

00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:09.640
the sound, but the concept
of listening now to,

00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:16.430
what did you just say, the
Ella, the Ellington [inaudible].

00:29:16.430 --> 00:29:20.550
And one of the things that I leaned

00:29:20.550 --> 00:29:25.190
from Ellington was
this comping, you know?

00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:30.070
How to accompany a
singer or the soloist,

00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:31.370
and it was quite incredible.

00:29:31.370 --> 00:29:35.740
Because if you look at
just a simple song like,

00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:41.770
Do Nothing To Hear From Me.

00:29:41.770 --> 00:29:49.030 position:56%
So there's a basic chords, you know,
but what he does is this inversion

00:29:49.030 --> 00:29:53.530
of the chords and runs with you
[laughter] you never thought of.

00:29:53.530 --> 00:30:00.990
But it, it, it does not interfere
with the spirit of the vocalist.

00:30:00.990 --> 00:30:05.040
A lot of accompanies,
you know, will overcrowd.

00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:09.550
&gt;&gt; Dan Morgenstern: Things he plays
in the cracks in an arrangement,

00:30:09.550 --> 00:30:15.080
you know, just perfect enhancing.

00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:18.560
&gt;&gt; Abdullah Ibrahim: So that's a
pianist, and [inaudible] listen

00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:23.870
to Ellington and then we always
are stunned and say, well,

00:30:23.870 --> 00:30:26.490
why didn't I think about that?

00:30:26.490 --> 00:30:35.600
I can imagine this as a
negative response [inaudible],

00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:39.490 position:56%
but I mean that is over because
they said Monk couldn't play either.

00:30:39.490 --> 00:30:44.440
&gt;&gt; Dan Morgenstern: And Monk
was, really loved Ellington.

00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:45.740
&gt;&gt; Abdullah Ibrahim: Yeah.

00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:47.040
&gt;&gt; Dan Morgenstern: Yeah.

00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:51.770
When you listen to the
1930s small group recordings

00:30:51.770 --> 00:30:55.670
where Duke sometimes, you know,
stretches out a little more,

00:30:55.670 --> 00:30:59.510
you can hear stuff that
Monk picked up from him.

00:30:59.510 --> 00:31:01.710
&gt;&gt; Abdullah Ibrahim:
That's right, yeah.

00:31:01.710 --> 00:31:09.250
And then [inaudible],
those were Ellington,

00:31:09.250 --> 00:31:13.350
and then [inaudible] was the one
that really, the first musician

00:31:13.350 --> 00:31:16.740
to endorse, to endorse Monk.

00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:18.040
&gt;&gt; Dan Morgenstern: Monk, yeah.

00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:23.300
I've seen the magazine, there
was a magazine called Music Dial,

00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:28.090
which was published by
black musicians in Harlem,

00:31:28.090 --> 00:31:32.610
it was a unique magazine,
the only one of its kind.

00:31:32.610 --> 00:31:36.200
It lasted a couple of
years, it got started

00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:40.570
in the mid 40s, very funny, 43.

00:31:40.570 --> 00:31:44.920
And Herbie wrote a column so then
that's where he mentions Monk,

00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:47.720
the first time he got
mentioned in print.

00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:50.270
&gt;&gt; Abdullah Ibrahim:
Wow, I must look that up.

00:31:50.270 --> 00:31:51.570
&gt;&gt; Dan Morgenstern:
Did you meet Herbie?

00:31:51.570 --> 00:31:52.870
Did you know him?

00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:54.770
&gt;&gt; Abdullah Ibrahim: No, I didn't.

00:31:54.770 --> 00:31:59.560
I tried to play all his tunes
even in South Africa, you know,

00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:03.430
the ten inch, the blue
note, ten inches.

00:32:03.430 --> 00:32:08.390
The first time I went to Japan, you
remember those little jazz clubs

00:32:08.390 --> 00:32:13.160
that they had, the size of
postage stamps all over Japan,

00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:18.370
and I played this [foreign
language] way up in the winter.

00:32:18.370 --> 00:32:22.700
I go into this club, little small,
little club, and the guy says,

00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:27.180
is this, I've got everything.

00:32:27.180 --> 00:32:28.540
I said [foreign language].

00:32:28.540 --> 00:32:39.070
So I realize then that, I mean,
this music resonated well beyond,

00:32:39.070 --> 00:32:44.690
beyond borders that we
maybe created for ourselves.

00:32:44.690 --> 00:32:48.330
So when I was a, when I
first had [inaudible],

00:32:48.330 --> 00:32:57.580
I tried to play some [inaudible],
but that already was pushing,

00:32:57.580 --> 00:33:04.100
you know, it was pushing
the boundaries.

00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:06.720
&gt;&gt; Dan Morgenstern:
Well it was lucky

00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:09.910 position:56%
that Bluno'd [phonetic] recorded her

00:33:09.910 --> 00:33:16.760
because otherwise there would only
be a tiny amount of stuff of his.

00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:21.070
He didn't have much luck,
he was such a nice man.

00:33:21.070 --> 00:33:27.350
I met him through Roswell
Rudd, Roswell and Steve Lacy,

00:33:27.350 --> 00:33:30.930
they loved Herbie, you know?

00:33:33.510 --> 00:33:40.200
So tell me, what are you, what is
the next thing you are about to do?

00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:43.670
&gt;&gt; Abdullah Ibrahim:
Tomorrow we go to New York,

00:33:43.670 --> 00:33:47.250
we're there for a few days and
then we go to, with the band,

00:33:47.250 --> 00:33:53.410
with [inaudible] and seven
piece, we do a US tour.

00:33:53.410 --> 00:34:02.070
We go to San Francisco,
Seattle, where else are we going?

00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:11.390
Dakota, Dakota Jazz Club, I
haven't been there for years.

00:34:11.390 --> 00:34:23.400
Phoenix at the music museum, it's
a tour until about the 9th of May,

00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:26.080
then I go back to Germany
and then we go to,

00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:29.910 position:56%
I go to South Africa do this project
with Musikkeller [assumed spelling]

00:34:29.910 --> 00:34:33.300
with Ekaya, my band, and
Musikkeller [assumed spelling],

00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:35.380
we do two nights.

00:34:35.380 --> 00:34:41.000
And it is a commemoration
or maybe a revisiting

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:49.040
of the jazz episode recording
that we did in the late 50s,

00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:57.660
and this is going to be perhaps
the beginning of a curriculum

00:34:57.660 --> 00:35:02.910
for an academy that we
have been planning on

00:35:02.910 --> 00:35:06.250
and working on for many years.

00:35:06.250 --> 00:35:11.140
It looks now as if we have some,
or we've been having the support

00:35:11.140 --> 00:35:20.240
from government and my,
my suggestion to them was

00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:23.460
that we should really
invest in the academy.

00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:31.150
And it looks as if we have it
together, so, coming to Library

00:35:31.150 --> 00:35:34.740
of Congress, everybody
knows that I'm here.

00:35:34.740 --> 00:35:41.650
And that I'm meeting with you,
and also how we can create this,

00:35:41.650 --> 00:35:49.970
some kind of a synergy, you know,
because with this incredible wealth

00:35:49.970 --> 00:35:54.010
of material that is here,
you know, especially in terms

00:35:54.010 --> 00:36:01.530
of reading an academy,
especially for young musicians.

00:36:02.990 --> 00:36:08.620 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Dan Morgenstern: Yeah we, we
really, we need good, good teachers,

00:36:08.620 --> 00:36:17.150
we need to transmit the tradition.

00:36:19.730 --> 00:36:21.970
&gt;&gt; Abdullah Ibrahim: So we've been
doing it with Ekaya, you know,

00:36:21.970 --> 00:36:24.860
with my, with the band,
whenever we travel,

00:36:24.860 --> 00:36:27.230
like I said, we have workshops.

00:36:27.230 --> 00:36:28.630
&gt;&gt; Dan Morgenstern: You do clinics?

00:36:28.630 --> 00:36:29.930
&gt;&gt; Abdullah Ibrahim: Clinics, yeah.

00:36:29.930 --> 00:36:32.990
The problem is that there's
no follow through, you see.

00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:39.010
So you do it for the concert,
or, and then it's gone.

00:36:39.010 --> 00:36:43.090
So there's no follow through,
and this is what, we need,

00:36:43.090 --> 00:36:48.300
need this academy, of
course a total agreement

00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:53.520
that the most important aspect
of this is getting the teachers

00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:57.550
and mentors who firstly
know the tradition

00:36:57.550 --> 00:37:01.810
and who are passionate about it.

00:37:01.810 --> 00:37:09.450
So I think, I think we've,
this visit here to the Library

00:37:09.450 --> 00:37:13.070
of Congress has opened up a
very possible [inaudible].

00:37:13.070 --> 00:37:20.750
And I'm speaking to you and I
just, your expertise and your,

00:37:20.750 --> 00:37:22.980
your [inaudible] knowledge
that you have

00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:28.950
of the music and its environment.

00:37:28.950 --> 00:37:32.720
&gt;&gt; Dan Morgenstern: I've just been
very lucky because I never thought

00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:37.490
when I was first became
interested in jazz and, you know,

00:37:37.490 --> 00:37:44.090
from recordings and see, I had the
good luck of seeing Fats Waller

00:37:44.090 --> 00:37:51.580
in Copenhagen when I was not quite
9 years old and he blew me away.

00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:57.930
But I never thought I would be
able to make a living out of that,

00:37:57.930 --> 00:38:02.830
but I started writing and then it's
just one thing led to another and,

00:38:02.830 --> 00:38:08.250
you know, it's a blessing to
have been able to make a living

00:38:08.250 --> 00:38:13.730
at something that you really love
and the music is so, you know,

00:38:13.730 --> 00:38:17.260
I still, you know,
I still get a kick

00:38:17.260 --> 00:38:19.960
out of my Louis Hot
Fives [laughter].

00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:26.050
&gt;&gt; Abdullah Ibrahim: [inaudible]
how the music, there's a filmmaker,

00:38:26.050 --> 00:38:37.250
John Irving, he's asked me to do,
to write some music for a film.

00:38:37.250 --> 00:38:43.120
And we were talking about this, he
said, when he was 14 years of age,

00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:48.350
he heard Ellington in London
and there was a singer with him,

00:38:48.350 --> 00:38:51.090
it was a blind singer, but
he never knew what he was,

00:38:51.090 --> 00:38:52.390
and I said, Al Hibbler.

00:38:52.390 --> 00:39:01.040
And that led me to the Liberian
Suite, you see with Al Hibbler "I

00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:07.440
Like the Sunrise", being blind.

00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:13.210
So until you, Liberian Suite, I
don't know if it is performed much.

00:39:13.210 --> 00:39:14.510
&gt;&gt; Dan Morgenstern: No.

00:39:14.510 --> 00:39:15.810
&gt;&gt; Abdullah Ibrahim: But that is
one of the works for his uncle,

00:39:15.810 --> 00:39:23.850
[inaudible] the Liberian Suite,
and get this interconnectedness

00:39:23.850 --> 00:39:26.950
that has happened,
happened with the music.

00:39:26.950 --> 00:39:34.180
And especially for teaching,
for it to be in the curriculum.

00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:36.660
So we can understand that the,

00:39:36.660 --> 00:39:43.530
the music in the diaspora
is far and wide.

00:39:43.530 --> 00:39:48.340
&gt;&gt; Dan Morgenstern: Yeah,
there's such a wealth of stuff,

00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:54.430
such a treasure trove of music
that can be introduced to people,

00:39:54.430 --> 00:40:01.510
and especially to young musicians
who very often are totally amazed

00:40:01.510 --> 00:40:08.090
when they come into contact with
some of the past that, you know,

00:40:08.090 --> 00:40:11.240
we had at Rutgers University

00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:15.390
where there is a master's
program in jazz history.

00:40:15.390 --> 00:40:21.150 position:56%
And then somebody saying they heard,
for the first time, "Weather Bird",

00:40:21.150 --> 00:40:25.190
which is a beautiful thing with
Earl Hines and Louis together.

00:40:25.190 --> 00:40:29.000
They were doing that in 1928?

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:38.020
&gt;&gt; Abdullah Ibrahim: I agree, it's
absolutely imperative that we,

00:40:38.020 --> 00:40:42.840
that there must be some
vehicle, this should be passed

00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:45.350
onto the other generation.

00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:50.480
&gt;&gt; Dan Morgenstern: Well, it's
been wonderful to see you again,

00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:53.660
and I hope it won't be another
60 years before we do [laughter],

00:40:53.660 --> 00:40:55.430
it was so good to see you.

00:40:55.430 --> 00:40:58.950
&gt;&gt; Abdullah Ibrahim: Thank you
for this, thank you for your time.

00:40:58.950 --> 00:41:02.600
&gt;&gt; Dan Morgenstern: I look
forward to hearing more

00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:11.030
of your beautiful music live and
recordings and all the best to you.

00:41:11.030 --> 00:41:14.740
We're both, I'm a little
older than Abdullah,

00:41:14.740 --> 00:41:20.960
we're both oxygenarians [laughter],
but we're still doing it right?

00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:24.960
