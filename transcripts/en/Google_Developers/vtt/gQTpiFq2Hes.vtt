&gt;&gt; Weininger:
Hi, I'm Nick Weininger,

00:00:06.234 --> 00:00:08.901
and I'm an engineer
on Google Custom Search Engine.

00:00:08.901 --> 00:00:10.467
And at Google I/O,

00:00:10.467 --> 00:00:11.667
I'm going to be giving a talk

00:00:11.667 --> 00:00:14.200
on advanced
custom search configuration.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.834
You may have already heard
about a custom search engine

00:00:16.834 --> 00:00:18.934
as a tool for allowing you,

00:00:18.934 --> 00:00:21.467
very easily
through a web interface,

00:00:21.467 --> 00:00:22.767
to create a search engine

00:00:22.767 --> 00:00:24.634
that is built on Google
search results,

00:00:24.634 --> 00:00:27.634
but searches over a slice
of the web you're interested in,

00:00:27.634 --> 00:00:29.067
which can be one site

00:00:29.067 --> 00:00:30.834
or some parts of a site,

00:00:30.834 --> 00:00:32.734
or a thousand
different sites.

00:00:32.734 --> 00:00:34.200
But what you may not know

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.367
is that Custom Search

00:00:35.367 --> 00:00:37.901
is also a very powerful
developer platform,

00:00:37.901 --> 00:00:40.100
and that's
what I'm going to talk about.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.000
The reason that it is
a developer platform

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.501
is that we provide an XML API

00:00:45.501 --> 00:00:48.267
both for the definition
of our custom search engine

00:00:48.267 --> 00:00:50.601
and for the results
that you get back

00:00:50.601 --> 00:00:52.534
when you query
a custom search engine.

00:00:52.534 --> 00:00:55.234
And using that XML API,

00:00:55.234 --> 00:00:56.934
you can programmatically create

00:00:56.934 --> 00:00:59.167
large numbers
of custom search engines.

00:00:59.167 --> 00:01:04.133
You can use the API to provide
advanced ranking tweaks

00:01:04.133 --> 00:01:06.767
so that the ranking of your
search results is different

00:01:06.767 --> 00:01:09.534
from that of regular
Google search results,

00:01:09.534 --> 00:01:10.934
and you can customize

00:01:10.934 --> 00:01:12.734
the presentation
of your results,

00:01:12.734 --> 00:01:14.033
so that they look
very different

00:01:14.033 --> 00:01:15.334
from Google search results

00:01:15.334 --> 00:01:16.334
and can be mashed up

00:01:16.334 --> 00:01:18.567
with other content
that you have.

00:01:18.567 --> 00:01:22.200
To give you briefly an example
of how that XML API works,

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.501
let me show you

00:01:23.501 --> 00:01:27.033
what a custom search engine
definition looks like.

00:01:27.033 --> 00:01:29.934
This is, in some sense,
the top level part.

00:01:29.934 --> 00:01:32.367
It gives you the title
of the custom search engine.

00:01:32.367 --> 00:01:33.834
It gives you some labels

00:01:33.834 --> 00:01:35.868
which pertain to the refinements

00:01:35.868 --> 00:01:38.200
that you can have
to navigate in that engine,

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.834
including one as you see
which is "BOOST" labeled,

00:01:40.834 --> 00:01:42.334
which tweaks the ranking.

00:01:42.334 --> 00:01:45.567
And then it points
to these other labels

00:01:45.567 --> 00:01:48.934
which we'll use in another part
of the XML definition

00:01:48.934 --> 00:01:50.968
to define the set of sites

00:01:50.968 --> 00:01:53.033
that's included
in the custom search engine.

00:01:53.033 --> 00:01:54.934
So if you want to hear more,

00:01:54.934 --> 00:01:56.234
if you want to know more

00:01:56.234 --> 00:01:58.868
about how to configure
custom search engines

00:01:58.868 --> 00:01:59.868
for your users,

00:01:59.868 --> 00:02:01.601
please come
to my Google I/O talk--

00:02:01.601 --> 00:02:03.200
Advanced Custom Search
Configuration.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.133
Thank you.
