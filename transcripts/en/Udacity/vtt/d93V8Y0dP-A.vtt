00:00:00.548 --> 00:00:03.781
Solution we'll look back in the iPython Notebook.

00:00:03.781 --> 00:00:06.145
Your code should look something like this.

00:00:06.145 --> 00:00:08.925
You could also use the original data set by

00:00:08.925 --> 00:00:12.420
un-commenting the commented lines here.

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.430
Now we're on this piece of code,

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:20.140
we can again use the describe function to look at a summary of the data.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.117
Once that finishes running,

00:00:22.117 --> 00:00:27.030
you will get a table that looks very similar to the one we got for Illinois.

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:31.026
We can then look at the first ten lines of the f

00:00:31.026 --> 00:00:34.382
underscore California data frame.

00:00:34.382 --> 00:00:38.353
Running that code, then gives you this table.

00:00:38.353 --> 00:00:43.175
When you scroll down, you will see the ten rolls we wanted printed and

00:00:43.175 --> 00:00:44.852
twenty eight columns.

00:00:44.852 --> 00:00:49.355
So now, we have a new data frame for California.

00:00:49.355 --> 00:00:55.125
Throughout this lesson, we'll show examples with the state of Illinois dataset.

00:00:55.125 --> 00:01:01.166
At some point in quizzes, we'll ask you to use the California dataset and

00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:03.804
repeat what we have just shown.

00:01:03.804 --> 00:01:08.020
We're going to explore the Medicare dataset somewhat further.

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:13.190
Remember, we wanted to see how we can find anomalies in the data.

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.030
Although we wanted to find outliers,

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:21.840
the x size here is not necessarily to find farther outliers.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.373
Note the exercise here is not necessarily to find outliers or

00:01:27.373 --> 00:01:30.301
fraud in the Medicare data, but

00:01:30.301 --> 00:01:37.369
to walk through the ways we can go about finding anomalies in data in general.

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:41.136
So the next important question we are going to ask is

00:01:41.136 --> 00:01:44.910
what are the variables of interest in the dataset?

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:52.693
Let's switch back to the iPython Notebook to investigate this.

00:01:52.693 --> 00:01:56.426
We had seen from the summary of the dataset that we

00:01:56.426 --> 00:01:59.259
had 28 different columns of data.

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:02.059
We had seen from the summary of the dataset that we

00:02:02.059 --> 00:02:04.050
had 28 different columns in it.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.669
Let's try to print the names of the columns.

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:13.010
To do so, simply execute this line of code.

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.310
The list of columns is long.

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.440
If you scroll to the bottom of it,

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.410
you would see six variables that may be of interest to us.

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.180
One of them is called average Medicare allowed amount.

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.100
The other is average submitted charge amount and

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.220
another is average Medicare payment amount.

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.590
The six variables that may be interesting are the average and

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.600
standard deviation of the Medicare allowed amount.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.750
The submitted charge amount and the Medicare payment amount.

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:52.600
These are the variables that have directly some indication of charges.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.330
We're going to investigate these variables further.

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:01.020
Some of the other columns are very specific to Medicare and

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:06.810
could be useful if we did some more research on Medicare and the data.

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.550
However, without doing some domain specific research, we can still see

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:18.080
that these variables could be of interest in detecting unusual charges.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:23.839
To keep things simple, we are only going to use the average Medicare amount.

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:28.586
We can use the standard deviation of the Medicare allowed amount and

00:03:28.586 --> 00:03:30.836
the submitted charge amount and

00:03:30.836 --> 00:03:36.510
the payments amount as inherent and reducible variants in the average charges.

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.020
After looking at the variables of interest in the dataset,

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:46.740
we came to the conclusions that the allowed amount, the charged amount and

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:51.280
the payment amount might be of interest for our investigation.
