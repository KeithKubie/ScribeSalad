00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.690
So a distributed system is a collection of

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:05.800
Nodes which are interconnected by a Local Area

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.210
Network or a Wide Area Network and this

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.050
Local Area Network may be implemented using a

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:17.240
twisted pair, coaxial cable and optical fiber And

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.070
if it is a Wide Area Network, it

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.900
could be implemented using a satellite communication microwave

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.650
links and so on. And the media access

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.750
protocols that may be available for communication of

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.360
these nodes on a Local Area Network or

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.200
a Wide Area Network, maybe ATM or Ethernet

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.890
and so on and so forth. That's sort of

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.430
the picture of What a distributed system is,

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.930
number one. Number two, there's no physical memory that

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.650
is shared between nodes of the distributed system.

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.790
So the only way nodes can communicate with one

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.600
another is by sending messages on the local

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.850
area network to one another. So there is

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.740
no shared memory for communication. Between the nodes

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:03.430
of the distributed system. No physical memory for communication

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.519
between the nodes of the distributed system. And

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.680
the third property is the fact the even

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.610
computation time, that is the time it takes

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.720
on a single node to do some meaningful processing,

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.540
that computation time is what we are calling

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.430
as the event computation time. That is Te.

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.590
And a node may also communicate With other

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.800
nodes in the system and that's what we're calling

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:31.370
as communication time or the messaging time, TM. And the third property

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:36.240
of the distributed system is that the time for communication between

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.840
nodes in the system, TM. Is much more significantly larger

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.480
than the event communication. So these are the three

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.640
properties which I would like to think of to make

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.540
sure that we have a shared understanding of what

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.540
we mean by distributed systems. That they are connected by

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.070
some sort of local area network or wide area

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.790
network. A collection of nodes. And their own physically shared

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.590
memory, so the only communication, only way they can communicate

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.860
with one another is via messages that are sent between

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.900
the nodes using the local area network. And the

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:13.220
third property, is the fact that the message communication

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.130
time is significantly larger And even computation time that

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.000
happens on a single node. You probably remember a good

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.120
friend, Leslie Lamport. I introduced you to him when

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.160
we talked about parallel systems, and I said that we

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.240
will see him again. In parallel systems, he's the

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.770
one who gave us the notion of sequential consistency, and

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:35.510
the same person that we're going to be

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.150
talking about in this lecture, Leslie Lamport. And

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.080
in particular LAN port has a definition for

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.660
a distributed system and the definition of a

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.930
distributed system verbatim goes like this. A system

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.940
is distributed if the message transmission time, Tm,

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.730
is not negligible to the time between events

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.790
in a single process. Cause there's a time

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.460
between events in a single process, there's a

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:03.690
message transmission time, and so the definition that Lesley

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.250
Lamport gives is that a system is distributed

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.070
is a message transmission time tm, is not negligible

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:12.830
compared to the time between events in a

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.960
single process. What is the implication of this definition?

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:20.240
Interestingly, even a cluster is a distributed system by

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.820
this definition. We've been talking about clusters a lot

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.420
when we discussed parallel systems and I told you

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.490
that clusters are the work horses of data centers

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:31.760
today. Even a cluster is a distributed system by

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.140
this definition because processors have become blazingly fast, so

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.070
the event computation has shrunk quite a bit. On

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.190
the other hand the message communication time is also

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.350
becoming better but not as fast as the computation

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.990
time that happens on a single processor and therefore even

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:50.130
on a cluster which is all contained in a

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.590
single rack in a data center, the message transmission

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.280
time is significantly more than The event time. And

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.080
so even a cluster is a distributed system by

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:03.790
this definition. The importance of this inequality is in

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.900
the design of algorithms that are going to span the

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.150
nodes of the network. What we want to make sure,

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.500
because the message transmission time is so significantly larger

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.279
than the event computation time on a single

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:21.630
node In structuring applications that run on distributed nodes

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.770
of a system like this, one has to be

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:27.390
very careful to make sure that the computation time

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:30.000
in the algorithms that you're designing is significantly

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.450
more than the communication time. Otherwise, we are not

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:35.550
going to reap the benefits of parallelism. If, most

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:39.160
of the time you're communicating. That's, the reason why,

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.490
this definition of distributed system is extremely important.
