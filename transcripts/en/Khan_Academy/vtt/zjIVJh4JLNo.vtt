00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.870
 

00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:03.240
Now that we know what a solution
is, let's think a

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.510
little bit about what it takes
to get a molecule to be

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:12.050
soluble into a solution
or into a solvent.

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:15.380
So let's say I start off with
a salt, and I'll do a little

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.840
side here, because in chemistry,
you'll hear the

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.080
word salt all the time.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.030
Let me write it down: salt.

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:26.210
And in our everyday language,
salt is table salt.

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.830
It makes food salty,
or sodium chloride.

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.910
 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.500
And this indeed is both a salt
from the Food Channel point of

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.980
view and from the chemistry
point of view, although the

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.760
chemistry point of view does not
care about what it does to

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.030
season your food.

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.325
The chemistry point of view, the
reason why it's called a

00:00:46.325 --> 00:00:48.860
salt is because it's
a neutral compound

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.230
that's made with ions.

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:55.420
So we all know that this is
made when you take sodium.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.770
Sodium wants to lose its one
electron in its valence shell.

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.330
Chloride really wants to
take it, so it does.

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:08.010
Chloride becomes a negative ion
and sodium is a positive

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.110
ion, and they stick to each
other really strongly because

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.590
this guy's positive now, and
this guy's negative after he

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.930
took away his electron.

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.140
Imagine your house is too small,
so you have to give

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.930
away your dog to someone who has
room for the dog, but now

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.200
you have to hang out at that
person's house all the time

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.570
because they have the
dog you love.

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.560
I don't know if that analogy
was at all appropriate.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.380
But I think you get the idea.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.560
A salt is just any compound
that's neutral.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.820
The other common ones, potassium
chloride, you could

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:46.440
do calcium bromide, or I could
do a bunch of them, but these

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.080
are all salts.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.430
And what we want to think about
is what happens when you

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.660
try to essentially dissolve
these salts in water.

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.800
So we know what water is
doing, liquid water.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.170
So let me draw some
liquid water.

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.440
So if that's the oxygen and then
you have two hydrogens

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.302
that are kind of lumping off of
it, I'll draw it like that.

00:02:09.302 --> 00:02:11.580
I'll draw a couple of them.

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:17.760
And then, of course, you have
another oxygen here.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.370
Maybe the hydrogens are in this
orientation because the

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.910
hydrogen ends are attracted
through hydrogen bonds-- we've

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.700
learned this-- to the oxygen
ends because this has a slight

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.560
negative charge here, a slight
positive charge here.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.200
These are the hydrogen
bonds that we've

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.720
talked so much about.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:40.270
And maybe you have another
oxygen here and it's got its

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.710
hydrogens there and there.

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:46.740
You have some hydrogen
bonds there.

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.310
I could do another oxygen here,
and you can kind of see

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.070
the structure that forms,
although what I'm drawing,

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.700
this is actually more of a-- if
you were in a solid state,

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.010
this would be kind of
rigid and they would

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.860
just vibrate in place.

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.260
In the liquid state, they're
all moving around.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.590
They're rubbing up against
each other, but they're

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.670
staying very close.

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.340
Actually, the liquid state for
water is actually the most

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.950
compact state for water.

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.860
Now, when you're dealing with
stuff like this-- these are

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.380
moving around, maybe this guy's
moving that way, that

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.620
guy's moving that way-- and you
want to dissolve something

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:19.470
like sodium chloride.

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.620
Sodium chloride's actually
quite a large molecule.

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.740
If you look at the Periodic
Table up here, oxygen is a

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.310
Period 2 element.

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:28.740
Hydrogen is very small.

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:30.730
We know when it gets into a
hydrogen bond with oxygen,

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.610
it's really just a proton
sitting out there because all

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.060
the electrons like to hang out
with the oxygen, while, say,

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.390
sodium and chloride, they're
considerably larger.

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.240
I won't go into the exact
molecular sizes, but maybe

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.440
sodium-- let's do sodium--
which actually, just as a

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:47.920
review, which is larger.

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.150
We know that it becomes smaller
as you go to the right

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:54.450
of the Periodic Table, so sodium
is quite a large atom,

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.230
while chloride is a good bit
smaller, but they're both

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.030
bigger than oxygen and a lot
bigger than hydrogen.

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.000
So let me draw that.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.170
So sodium-- I'll do sodium
as a positive.

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:07.830
It's pretty big.

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:09.080
Maybe it looks like this.

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.800
 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.110
Sodium is positive and then
you have the chloride.

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:18.959
The chloride I'll
do in purple.

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.862
They're still pretty big.

00:04:20.862 --> 00:04:25.050
The chloride, it'll
look like this.

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.460
And what happens when you
put it into water, it

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:28.330
disassociates.

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.780
Even though these guys in
a solid state, they're

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.440
jam-packed to each other.

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.930
When you put it into water,
the positive cations are

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.350
attracted to the negative
partial charges on the oxygen

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:44.110
side of the water, and the
negative anions are attracted

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:45.735
to the positive sides
of the hydrogen.

00:04:45.735 --> 00:04:48.570
 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:54.400
But in order to get, for
example, this sodium ion into

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.120
the water, it has
to fit in there.

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.560
So, for example, I drew this as
a liquid initially, but if

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.860
this was a solid and you had
this structure, it would be

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:03.000
extremely difficult.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.770
In fact, it would be next to
impossible to squeeze these

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.450
huge sodium ions in place
to make it soluble

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:11.140
into, say, solid ice.

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:14.540
And as even cold water, these
bonds are still going to be

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:16.560
pretty strong and they're
going to be just kind of

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.590
barely moving past each other
because there's not a lot of

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:19.285
kinetic energy.

00:05:19.285 --> 00:05:23.710
So what you need to do is, the
warmer the water you have-- I

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:25.950
mean, you can fit it into cold
water, because at least cold

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:30.340
water has some give, but the
warmer the better, because you

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:34.590
have some kinetic energy, and
that essentially gives space.

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:38.085
Or it makes room for this sodium
ion that's entering in

00:05:38.085 --> 00:05:40.960
to kind of bump its way into
a configuration that's

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:41.870
reasonably stable.

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:43.830
And a reasonably stable
configuration would look

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:46.460
something like this.

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:50.580
Sodium would look-- and then
you'd have a bunch of-- sodium

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:51.600
is positive.

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.860
It would be attracted to the
negative end of the water

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:58.280
molecules, so the oxygen end.

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.950
So it looks like that, the
oxygen end, and then the

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:02.200
hydrogen ends are going
to be pointing

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:03.450
in the other direction.

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:06.445
 

00:06:06.445 --> 00:06:11.310
The hydrogen ends are going
to be on the other side.

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:14.370
And, of course, the chlorine
atom is going to be very

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:17.740
attracted to that other side, so
the chlorine atom might be

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:19.830
right over here.

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:22.360
 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.570
So the chlorine atom might want
to hang out right here.

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:27.870
 

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:31.140
In order to get as much of the
sodium chloride into your

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:32.840
water sample, you want
to heat up the

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:34.220
water as much as possible.

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:38.380
Because what that does is it
allows these bonds to not be

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:42.160
taken as seriously and these
relatively huge atoms to kind

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:43.740
of bump their way in.

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:53.230
So, in general, if you think
about solubility of a solute

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:58.080
in water-- or especially if you
think of a solid solute,

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:03.740
which is sodium chloride-- into
a liquid solvent, then

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:05.860
the higher the temperature while
you're in the liquid

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:09.490
state, the more of the solid
you're going to be able to get

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:11.480
into the liquid, or you're going
to raise solubility.

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:17.110
So temperature goes up,
solubility goes up.

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:19.470
For example, if you were to take
some table salt, and you

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:20.450
could experiment with this.

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:24.235
It doesn't seem too dangerous
and not too expensive because

00:07:24.235 --> 00:07:25.650
salt is reasonably cheap.

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:27.490
Keep putting it into
a glass, and at

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:29.280
some point it'll dissolve.

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:31.050
You could shake it a little
bit, just to make sure.

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:33.030
You could think about what's
happening at the molecular

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:35.280
level while you shake it and why
does that help to shake or

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:36.300
stir things?

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:41.390
But at some point, you're going
to end up with-- if this

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:46.080
is your glass of water, the salt
will keep going in there,

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:49.310
but at some point, you'll have
salt crystals at the bottom of

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:50.160
your glass.

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:54.290
At that point, your water is
saturated with salt at the

00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:56.540
temperature that you're trying
to deal with it.

00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:58.680
Now, right when you start seeing
that, if you were to

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:00.950
put it in the microwave or if
you were to heat it up, you

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:04.640
would see that even these guys
are able to be absorbed in the

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:07.290
water, and that's because the
extra kinetic energy from the

00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:09.910
temperature is making it more
likely that these guys are

00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:12.800
going to be able to bump out of
configuration for just long

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:15.260
enough for these guys
to bump in.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:19.880
And just a little side note,
when you take these salts,

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:22.970
which are just ionic compounds
that are neutral, they're made

00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:25.200
of ions, but they cancel
each other out.

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:28.650
When you put them in water,
these compounds by themselves

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:30.710
aren't normally-- when they're
in the solid state, they don't

00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:32.080
normally conduct electricity.

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:34.159
Even though they're charged,
they're very closely stuck to

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:35.960
each other, so there's
not a lot of room

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:37.600
for movement of charge.

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:40.450
But once you disassociate them
in water or dissolve them in

00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:42.610
water, now, all of a sudden,
you have these floating

00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:48.040
charges in the water, and this
does conduct electricity, so

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:53.340
it becomes quite a reasonable
conductor of electricity.

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:55.710
So the general rule of thumb is,
if you're dealing with a

00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:58.670
solid in a liquid solvent,
lowering the temperature will

00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:01.340
decrease the solubility, because
it's harder to jam the

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:03.690
molecules in there, and
increasing the temperature

00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:05.050
will increase the solubility.

00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:05.960
But what about a gas?

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:12.090
What if you make some soda and
you want to dissolve some

00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:16.270
carbon dioxide into, let's
say, water again?

00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:19.110
So here, the way to think about
it when we did it with

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:21.760
salts, these are ionic
compounds.

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:24.670
They had some natural attraction
to the different

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:27.210
polar ends of the
water molecule.

00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:30.210
But gases, for the most
part, do not have

00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:32.420
strong attractive forces.

00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:34.250
That's why they're gases,
especially at room

00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:34.660
temperature.

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:37.680
They like to be free.

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:40.700
A gas, they have a good bit of
kinetic energy, but more

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:46.610
important, the bonds between
them, for example, in ideal

00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:48.900
gases we talked about it, they
just have their London

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:49.810
dispersion forces.

00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:52.640
They have very weak bonds, and
that's why at, say, the same

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:55.590
temperature and pressure that
water would be a liquid, a lot

00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:57.180
of these gases are gases.

00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:59.190
They jump away from each other
because they don't want to

00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:00.520
touch each other.

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:02.950
Now, when you put this in
liquid, and this is at least

00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:05.160
my intuition, so let's just say
this is a bunch of water

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:08.600
molecules here.

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:13.550
If you were to dissolve-- let's
say it's carbon dioxide.

00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:15.460
You can ignore this
stuff up here.

00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:20.210
If you were to dissolve carbon
dioxide in water-- so if you

00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:23.300
were to dissolve this in water,
so those are some

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:24.700
carbon dioxide molecules.

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:28.260
I'm just drawing the whole
molecule as a circle.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.880
What do these molecules
want to do?

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:34.530
It's natural state is a gas and
it is a gas at let's say

00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:39.000
the standard pressure, so it
really wants to escape from

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.310
this water, but it just can't
do it that easily because

00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:45.130
there's water molecules
all around it, right?

00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:47.380
This guy right here, he might
want to bump out, but he's

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:48.630
surrounded by water molecules.

00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:51.570
 

00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:53.590
So what would help
him bump out?

00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:57.140
Well, if you raise the average
kinetic energy of the system,

00:10:57.140 --> 00:10:59.160
if you made all of these guys,
that these guys were moving

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:01.720
faster, and especially if the
carbon dioxide molecules

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:04.180
themselves had more kinetic
energy, then maybe

00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:05.260
they could break out.

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:08.390
And as you have from personal
experience with Coke bottles,

00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:10.470
you could also shake the system,
because if you shake

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:13.940
the system, it just moves
everything around enough that

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:15.500
these guys can escape.

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:18.860
So when you're dissolving
a gas inside of a liquid

00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:22.140
solvent, when the solute is
a gas, it actually has the

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:25.420
opposite effect, that
rising temperature.

00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:31.500
So when temperature goes up,
solubility goes down because

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:33.010
these guys want to escape.

00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:33.980
They want to be free.

00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:36.220
They want to be away from other
molecules and they want

00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:39.500
to bounce around in open-- I
shouldn't use the word air--

00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:41.100
in open space.

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:43.940
And so anything that lets the
system move around more,

00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:44.550
they're going to go up.

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:49.570
And likewise, if temperature
goes down, solubility goes up.

00:11:49.570 --> 00:11:51.890
The other factor, and it's not
as big of a factor when you

00:11:51.890 --> 00:11:56.520
talk about a solid solute, but
when you talk about a liquid

00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:57.720
solute-- let me just
do it again.

00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:00.880
So those are the carbon dioxide
molecules and then you

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:04.730
have a bunch of water
molecules-- they should all be

00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:07.630
the same size-- that
it's dissolved in.

00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:09.730
I think you get the idea.

00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:12.340
Pressure is also a big factor.

00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:14.800
I already said that these guys,
their natural state is

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:15.480
to roam free.

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:17.320
They want to get out.

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:19.660
They want to somehow bounce
out of the water.

00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:23.050
But if you have a really high
pressure up here-- just the

00:12:23.050 --> 00:12:26.270
atmosphere up here has just
tons of molecules bouncing

00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:30.590
really hard down on the surface
of our solution-- so

00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:35.240
if there's just tons of
molecules bouncing really hard

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:37.180
off the surface, it'll
be harder for

00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:39.360
anything to escape upwards.

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:41.950
And that's why, when you have
pressure going up, or at least

00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:45.760
this is the intuition, when
pressure goes up, solubility

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:49.620
of a gas also goes up.

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:51.120
And this is for a gas.

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:54.040
So just the interesting thing
to remember is that when you

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:57.540
think about solubility, solids
do the inverse of gas.

00:12:57.540 --> 00:13:01.000
Temperature is good for solid
solubility, right?

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.860
We said when you put salt or
sugar in water, it's good to

00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:04.750
increase the temperature.

00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:06.570
You'll be able put
more in there.

00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:09.340
On the other hand, with a
gas, it's the opposite.

00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:13.160
You want colder temperatures
to put more gas into the

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:16.710
solution, or you want higher
pressure to keep it-- at least

00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:19.930
in the way my mind works-- from
escaping out the top.

00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:22.240
Anyway, hope you found
that useful.
