The only individuals who actually get sickle cell anemia are those who have

00:00:04.742 --> 00:00:10.254
two copies of the S version of the HPV gene. And therefore the

00:00:10.254 --> 00:00:15.616
s allele is recessive. Which is true for many of these inherited conditions. One

00:00:15.616 --> 00:00:22.579
needs two copies of the allele in order to experience the condition.
