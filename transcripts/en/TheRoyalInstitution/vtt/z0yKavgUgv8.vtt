00:00:01.609 --> 00:00:05.920
The CHRISTMAS LECTURES from the Royal Institution
have delivered cutting edge science to young

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.240
audiences for nearly 200 years.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.870
And that's a very long time.

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:16.410
That tradition is still running strong today,
reaching even greater audiences on television,

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.870
online, and most recently through 3D headsets.

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.420
I'm Olympia Brown and I work at the Royal
Institution organising the CHRISTMAS LECTURES.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.640
Look, I can drink water without looking.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.100
Every year, we try to think of topics that
are as fresh and exciting

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:35.950
and totally made up

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.780
as possible for the kids in our audience,

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.570
and this year I'm really excited that we've
got a topic that we've never before covered

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.010
in the history of the lectures. Because it's
not science. At all.

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.570
I'm delighted to pretend that the 2016 CHRISTMAS
LECTURES will be called Decoding The Stars:

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:54.489
A New Look at Astrology.

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:58.149
Here at the Royal Institution we're not afraid
to tackle imaginary subjects, so we want to

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:03.149
look at the recent developments that have
opened up astrology as a legitimate area of

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.700
pseudoscientific research.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.460
When looking for who to deliver these lectures,
there was only one choice,

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:10.979
and that was Professor Michael de Crespigny,

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.320
who has worked tirelessly since two days ago
when we asked him to do this video

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:20.619
to advance the field and bring it into a legitimate
area of scientific research.

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:28.279
Where do we come from? What's the meaning
of life?

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.280
What influence does the cosmos have on our lives?

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.880
None.

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.610
These and other questions are
what I've been considering for the last

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:36.460
30 seconds.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.210
I'm Professor Michael de Crespigny and I'm
actually the Ri's Director of Finance.

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.780
I was a sceptic at first, and obviously still
am.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:52.610
But the Universe is a beautiful symphony of
connections. And if we listen carefully and

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:58.220
collect the right data, we can hear the harmony
of the cosmos calling out to us.

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:04.759
I remember as a young child I came here, to
the CHRISTMAS LECTURES to see the famous Carl Sagan.

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:10.640
He really led to me getting a degree
in quantum astrophysics.

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.960
I became very interested in stuff like string
theory and quantum pigeonholing

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.120
(which is a real thing. Honestly. Google it!)

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.290
and since then I've been conducting research
to think more scientifically

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:29.170
about how the whole area of astrology could
have a more robust scientific base.

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.370
I'm Frank James I'm Professor of Cosmic History
here at the Royal Institution.

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:44.220
My job is to write about the history of everything, the
cosmos, and everything basically.

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:50.400
Astrology has a very long history, going back
to the ancient Babylonians in the first Millenium BC.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.160
It hasn't had a particularly good press over
the past few hundred years

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.180
because it's all bonkers,

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.819
and Michael's great achievement is to make
it into a proper field of nonsense and that's

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:04.250
what we'll be celebrating with the CHRISTMAS
LECTURES this year.

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:10.160
One can see a similar sort of pattern in the
work of Michael Faraday in the 19th Century

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.319
here at the Ri,

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:18.200
where he began theorising about magnetism
in terms of force being transmitted through

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.239
a delicious jelly

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:24.599
But by the 1850s had turned that into the
field theory of electromagnetism, which became

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:27.790
and remains one of the cornerstones of modern
theoretical physics.

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.780
In exactly the same way, Michael de Crespigny
in the last decade or so has turned astrology

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:39.040
into something where we can actually understand
how the cosmos affects what happens down here on Earth.

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:44.670
Across the three lectures, we'll look at how
the fictional study of astrology has evolved

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.690
from its humble roots.

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.490
The first lecture will be titled 'Breaking
Cosmic Barriers:

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:53.640
Convincing People Your Made Up Facts Are Real.'

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:59.190
The second, 'Quantum Horoscopes: Decoding
Interplanetary Connections' will just make

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:05.970
up some generic sounding stuff about your
life, and use a few big sciencey words.

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:10.350
And finally the third lecture will be called
'Why Unicorns Are Real:

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:12.320
Your Destiny is a Mermaid,'

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.049
where we'll be making arbitrary and vague predictions about the future of astrology,

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:21.669
and seeing how big data is allowing us to
make up whole new types of imaginary twaddle.

00:04:23.809 --> 00:04:29.550
Over the years in my research I've come to
realise that science isn't just about experiments

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.830
or theories, it's also about convincing people.

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:41.039
What we do at the Ri is to convince people
that science is right, by whatever means necessary.

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:44.839
Coming to speak in the same lecture theatre
where Michael Faraday started the CHRISTMAS

00:04:44.839 --> 00:04:47.919
LECTURES is a very humbling experience. Or
probably is for whoever actually does that.

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:53.419
I hope to share my passion and knowledge of
astrology to inspire the next generation of

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:55.559
celestial scientists.

00:04:55.559 --> 00:05:00.669
Ultimately the CHRISTMAS LECTURES tries to
open our audiences minds

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:01.969
(Open minds. Open... skeleton.. get it?)

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:07.089
And this year I really hope we can begin to
remove the stigma around astrology.

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:14.080
&lt;Note to editor: insert serious face here.
The laughing totally gives away the joke&gt;
