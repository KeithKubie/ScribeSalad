00:00:05.137 --> 00:00:06.472
- All right!

00:00:06.505 --> 00:00:08.274 align:start position:0%
Man, today's gonna
be stresful, guys.

00:00:08.307 --> 00:00:09.509 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna admit it.

00:00:09.542 --> 00:00:10.977
The Comedy Central execs
are coming

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.046
and they're judging us,
okay?

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:17.483
So I'm here to relieve
a little stress with weed

00:00:17.516 --> 00:00:18.684
and this game
that I made up.

00:00:18.717 --> 00:00:20.286
It's called speed golf.

00:00:20.319 --> 00:00:21.587 align:start position:0%
And the rules
are pretty simple.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.890 align:start position:0%
You hit the ball,
you sprint after it,

00:00:23.923 --> 00:00:25.258 align:start position:0%
and then the next guy
comes up,

00:00:25.291 --> 00:00:27.160 align:start position:0%
he counts to five,
then he hits the ball,

00:00:27.193 --> 00:00:28.327 size:78% position:39%
then he sprints after it,

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:29.662 align:start position:0%
then the next guy
comes up,

00:00:29.695 --> 00:00:31.297 align:start position:0%
he counts to five,
then he hits the ball,

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:32.832 size:78% position:39%
then he sprints after it,
and it--it keeps going.

00:00:32.865 --> 00:00:34.400 align:start position:0%
You guys get that.

00:00:34.433 --> 00:00:37.203 align:start position:0%
The goal is to get done playing
golf as fast as possible,

00:00:37.236 --> 00:00:38.604
because golf sucks.

00:00:38.637 --> 00:00:40.006 align:end position:100%
- Are you going to keep
talking and smoking,

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:41.641 align:end position:100%
or are you actually
gonna play?

00:00:41.674 --> 00:00:42.575
- All right, having a--

00:00:42.608 --> 00:00:44.010
having a high moment there.

00:00:44.043 --> 00:00:45.011
Okay, good.
Thank you, Vlad.

00:00:45.044 --> 00:00:46.546
Keep me on my toes, baby.

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:48.381
- You're killing me.
- Pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft.

00:00:48.414 --> 00:00:51.884
Now remember, the goal is
to go as fast as possible.

- All right,
you're up, Jak.

00:00:57.556 --> 00:00:59.859
- This is going to
be great.

00:00:59.892 --> 00:01:02.161
- One, two,

00:01:02.194 --> 00:01:03.830
three, four, five.

it's going to hit Adam.

What do you yell?
I'm from the Bronx.

00:01:08.167 --> 00:01:09.469 align:start size:78% position:22%
I don't know what to say.

00:01:09.502 --> 00:01:11.170
- Uh, fore.
- Fore! Fore! Fore, fore!

00:01:11.203 --> 00:01:13.306
- Not four, five.

00:01:13.339 --> 00:01:16.476
Ow!
- Ooh, shit.

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:17.577
- Come on.

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.412
- That was--
that was awesome.
