1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:05,740
Um, well, I love the echo and it's,
it's a big echo chamber. We're in.

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,940
Well, sort of. Yeah. Hey, I'm
Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich.

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:12,750
This is radio lab, the podcast and uh,
we're coming to you on the podcast,

4
00:00:12,751 --> 00:00:13,830
not from our usual space,

5
00:00:13,831 --> 00:00:18,130
which is the studio in New York now or
in La and we're sitting on a stage in

6
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:22,810
Chits Royce Hall and on the campus of
UCLA. We're on tour. So we have a show,

7
00:00:22,811 --> 00:00:24,140
a live show that we do. We can't here,

8
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:27,330
couldn't get back to do our podcast in
the normal way so we can do it right here

9
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,300
on stage. Yeah, we here.

10
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:31,950
We wanted to actually just talk a little
bit about what's going to be happening

11
00:00:31,951 --> 00:00:32,641
next week.

12
00:00:32,641 --> 00:00:36,330
Next week we have this awesome show which
we call color because that's what it's

13
00:00:36,331 --> 00:00:36,751
about.

14
00:00:36,751 --> 00:00:41,490
It's about the nature and the
peculiarities and the anecdotals and the

15
00:00:41,491 --> 00:00:43,230
everything of color ads, right?

16
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,690
We're going to explore all kinds of
things about the different colors, race,

17
00:00:45,691 --> 00:00:48,840
very greens, yellows and
all the shades in between.

18
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:52,440
But we're going to play cool stuff right
now because here's the cool thing about

19
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:54,660
this, this show. Um, we, uh,

20
00:00:54,661 --> 00:00:57,640
one of the experiments we're doing
for this colors podcast is, uh,

21
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:01,260
we are working with a ton of really
talented musicians who are going to be

22
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:06,060
playing a lot of color themed songs
and tons of tons of great musicians are

23
00:01:06,061 --> 00:01:09,930
going to be on this hour including Reggie
Watts. You may remember him from a,

24
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,600
the curious sounds concert we
aired a couple of months ago.

25
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,740
Amazing Dude does this whole
like acapella looping situation.

26
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,660
She has him a Mike in a little box and
while we've actually been here, uh,

27
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,870
on tour, he was back in New York
city standing by, so we kind of,

28
00:01:24,871 --> 00:01:26,370
we could kind of miss each
other. Can you guys hear me?

29
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:28,550
But we call them up on
our cell phones and uh,

30
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:32,750
yeah. Okay. There we go. Yeah, panel
chair. Okay. And we all hear each other.

31
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:34,910
Yes, I can hear, I can,
I can hear each other.

32
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:39,470
So I guess you're going to do
the Kermit song light. Yeah,

33
00:01:39,471 --> 00:01:43,810
I'm going to attempt screens to,
yeah, I'll use those words of it.

34
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:50,350
So, Reggie, what does it
mean to be green? Well,

35
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:52,900
ecofriendly environment
is very important to me.

36
00:01:52,901 --> 00:01:57,340
And the planet really needs help. No.
Um, I guess, uh, being being greed.

37
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:01,000
I don't, you know, I don't know.
I guess being green is like,

38
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:05,470
it's about being different. So I
guess, uh, it isn't easy being green.

39
00:02:05,471 --> 00:02:09,670
It's not easy being yourself. Oh,
sorry. We can't be there to witness it.

40
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:14,100
Five in person. I'm pretty
relatively angry, but uh, it's okay.

41
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:19,850
All right, well thanks Reggie. They're
calling for us to go on stage there.

42
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:24,210
