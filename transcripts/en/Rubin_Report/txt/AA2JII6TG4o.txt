Speaker 1:          00:00          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:04          do you think lawsuits are the answer to stop some of this stuff? I'm also realizing right now that would our runway to fix this is becoming perilously short. Like we're getting to the best pretty damn quick. The 2020 election is right around the corner and that seems to me to be what this is all ramping up to.

Speaker 3:          00:22          Absolutely. The Covington case was such a glaring example of that. So I was on vacation in Mexico. Yeah. Okay, so let's just go all in on Covington right now. Yeah, so it was a little town north of port of are out there just hanging out too. You know, going through Twitter and [inaudible] son of a bitch, try on Twitter, on vacations. We'll see what happens. And so I see Maggie Haberman, the premiere reporter for the premiere news publication in the country covering American politics. New York Times. Yeah, exactly. Basically calling for the expulsion of a bunch of kids that she's never met that she doesn't know based on an event she didn't see. And I found that so shocking. I was like, we're crossing a whole new line now. If we're going to go, it's one thing to go after what somebody said 10 years ago. That's problematic on its own terms.

Speaker 3:          01:06          We'll get, we'll get to that in a little bit too. That's what we have statutes of limitations for, but the a is that you're not going to be held responsible for what she did when you're 10, but the or when you're 20, when you're 40. But the here, these kids were who were just going up to DC to be part of the pro life march. Uh, and usually the pro life march at five at family participate in that. They're, they're just having fun. You know, they're not mean. They're not out there harassing people. They're just expressing what they believe. A, these kids are having fun. Probably the first time ever to Washington DC there by the Lincoln memorial was beautiful memorial and all of a sudden they start getting harassed out of the blue and they have likely never met the black Hebrew Israelites. Right? Some of us that have no what's coming every, I lived in New York City for many years.

Speaker 3:          01:47          Every by these guys, many times, every insult, known demand. It's like really? They're almost like an insult comic. If the routine is so extreme, it's like they find something going the next, then the next thing the next day, like bad don Rickles. Oh, exactly. Exactly the worst version, right? It's all you combined Farah Khan with Don Rowe. Yeah. Right. So, but these kids have no ideas and they have an African American friend that's there with them and the he's being attacked and so they start defending him. They started attacking, making various anti gay slurs there. They question, they respond back to that in defense of people who are gay. So I was like, these are in that mean kids. These are kids trying to handle the shocking environment. They decided to go internal and start, okay, let's not deal with these guys. Let's do our school tiers. One of their school cheers as the old Haiku, as a, as the Haiku dance, which is the Great New Zealand rugby team.

Speaker 3:          02:33          All black. Yeah. I, in fact two weeks before it's shown it to my son because I was like, look at how awesome. It's awesome. It's all over youtube by the way. Anyone can watch it. And absolutely. When I first saw it in the movie with Matt Damon, that's the greatest sports dance I've ever seen. In fact, before I want to get inspired by something, I'll just put it on and go get ready. Yeah. So the, so they do that as part of it. That's why when the kid's tearing his clothes off and it's right after that, it's happening, then all of a sudden the native American comes up with some friends and he's doing the drums. So two thirds of the kids think, oh, he's joining in because we just did the Iq thing. Oh, this is great. And what do they know? The most popular, uh, native American sports thing they know is the, is the Tomahawk Chop from, uh, from the Florida, stayed from Kansas City chiefs and Indian Atlanta Braves.

Speaker 3:          03:14          All the places where they're familiar. And there, it's right on the, on the border of the Kentucky, Ohio border. So the kind of programs they'd be familiar with, that's what they see. Not Nobody's mocking him. Nobody's chanting, build the wall out of. Nobody's blocking him. Nobody's surrounding him. And then at one point they started, some of the kids start to figure out, okay, something's odd. Because some of the people behind him are saying, go back to Europe. And it's like, where did that come from? Uh, and then they realize something's weird. Then they just leave. And then as they're on their bus home, all of a sudden their lives are being upended and they're not being up ended by just some random bot accounts who started their being offended by Kathy Griffin who's calling for them to be doxed. They're offended by Maggie Haberman calling for them to be expelled.

Speaker 3:          03:53          They're upended by Matthew Dowd, who's on ABC, who was, it was a prominent, a Catholic on ABC saying that things need to happen to these kids. And in Navarro, who is saying bad things need to happen to these kids, almost the entire media is, and then you have Hollywood celebrities calling for them to be put through the shredder for them to be attacked for them to be. You had uh, uh, a writer who claimed to be part of Saturday night at nine live say she's going to extend sexual favors for anybody who physically assaulted these people. And I was like, these are probably the kids.

Speaker 2:          04:19          These are, by the way, these are blue checked verified people, these are all of them.

Speaker 3:          04:23          Generally the people that Twitter says you should pay attention to that we've verified that. We validated that we've authenticated that we've authorized. And uh, it, Twitter and social media does almost nothing about this. In fact, they run with the fake news story and these kids lives are almost over in five seconds based on a misleading video. Um, and so I saw it and I, uh, when I first saw the video I was like, oh, that's going to be fake news story. Just cause you know, DC politics, you know, you know lefty protest culture, you know the chances that a bunch of Catholic kids came up and found a lefty to harass isn't that real high and Washington DC say that happened in a small town in Alabama. Okay, maybe uh, but there's like this story doesn't make sense. And so I was like, okay, that will probably blow over. And that was well getting on a plane to go to boost areas. Then I get to the booze and see these things and I'm like, they're going to destroy these kids' lives. And I realize if they think if they can do this, they can do anything to anyone at anytime, anywhere.

Speaker 2:          05:16          And that's exactly. So then you started tweeting about it alongside a couple of other people and I thought a couple of other people in the legal world and I thought, all right, I've got to talk to this guy because if this one doesn't get corrected, which fortunately thanks to you and it's ongoing, you and several other people, it is getting corrected. But I thought if this one doesn't get corrected, if we let them demolish high school students, we're done. We are done. So can you catch us up on sort of where, where this is all at now?

Speaker 3:          05:43          So when I did initially is I first just put out a tweet and said if anybody wants to sue Maggie Haberman now represent it for free. And I was just agitated, just ticked off. And I didn't tune into Twitter until like two days later when I came back and all of a sudden it blown up and I'm getting all these and I'm like, okay. I realized that this was becoming very high profile. And so I go on Fox and my goal is to get everybody to start to re retract, start to back up, start to retail, the different story. And unfortunately almost all the institutional media starts to backtrack fast. So to be clear, you did not want to go the legal route. Actually you are giving everybody, man, I saw you do this. You gave them the chance guys, just delete the tweets. Did you even ask them to issue apologies.

Speaker 3:          06:21          I don't even remember that I said was, I said that everybody got 48 hours to do one of three things, either correct or delete or apologize, just do something to correct the record and let me to her credit congress woman Omar, who usually has no problem saying anything under God's green earth. Uh, she did, she did it within an hour, but she only did it because roll call covered my story. So his role called covered my stories. Like, Oh, maybe I can get sued. AndW , you know, took it down. By the way, right before that she had sent out a tweet linking them to white supremacist and a whole bunch of others. Yeah, a whole bunch of false information. She labeled them in a whole new, unique ways. They'll leave it to her to figure out a way to do that. The, uh, this is a member of Congress, by the way.

Speaker 3:          06:57          Then you have Senator Warren is running for the presidency of the United States repeating false statements about these kids. Well that's because she's native Americans. Yeah. Yes, yes, exactly. She has to stand up for her. Trump the level, like they portrayed him as a native American elder. Well, I clerked for native American tribes. I worked for one of these old school lefty, one of the best trial lawyers in the country. And I was like, hey. I was like, I don't think he's an elder of that particular tribe. Then I realized they were just confusing the terms because he's elderly. They were going to call him an elder. I was like, that's an insult to all the most native American elders are very carefully selected. They take their job very seriously. In fact, their court system, if we had an ideal court system in the world, it would be the native American elder system.

Speaker 3:          07:32          I'd be all for it because there's 12, 12 people sit around and you come and you tell him your dispute and they try to find a remedy that will satisfy everybody and they try not to be too punitive. They try not to be too, uh, too involved. They just try to say, okay, what's caused this problem? How can we address the cause of it? And they're focused on reconciliation. How can we bring people together so it doesn't happen again and people don't feel bad at the end of it. Not Great for your profession, but exactly a much better system. I'd be all for it. I mean I'm happy, happily forfeit my law degree to see that system put in place, have the 12 members of your community get to decide these kinds of disputes and find ways to put people back together and protect all the things that matter to us rather than deepening the division and the bitterness that exists.

Speaker 3:          08:13          And the legal system often creates that. People often leave it even when they win unsatisfied. And so the uh, so, but so they put this guy in that context, there's like, it wasn't a Vietnam war veteran. The was really not really being accurate. They're trying to script a narrative, trying to tell the story, but doing it to these kids and include the message was if we can destroy them, we can destroy you. It was an ultimate exemplar mechanism of media narrative structure and that's why I volunteer to help them out. And so now represent 14 families in Covington. Oh about 90% of the people I went on Fox and said 48 hours notice, just clean it up and we'll be done. And even after that, and giving people additional opportunities and additional opportunities, please take it down, please. That none of the family members want to sue.

Speaker 3:          08:57          They don't want to deal with the nightmares of the legal system. They don't have to go through all that hassle hurdle. Um, but they want the record corrected and they don't want to happen to anyone else. That's it. And so I was like, let's set a record. Let's set a pattern. Let's set a precedent year that this can get corrected and remedied, that he can't do this to these kids. You can't do this to these people that you do have standards. You have to be bound by those standards. You have to be governed by those standards, and you have to act according to those standards. For those that refuse to do anything about it, they're going to be sued.

Speaker 2:          09:24          Yeah. Because so some of them still left the tweets up or did an apology.

Speaker 3:          09:27          Kathy Griffin. Matthew Dowd, oddly enough, Maggie Haberman, uh, Senator Warren, uh, congresswoman Holland. Uh, those are the five highest profile examples of people who refuse to correct.

Speaker 2:          09:38          When you see a mob descent, it's a little, it's a little hard to figure out how coordinated it is, whether it's group think, is this coming from the top? Is this organic? As much as you've had to deal with these things. And especially since you dealt with the most recent one that's still unfolding right now, what's your take? Is it, is it a little bit of everything?

Speaker 3:          09:58          It's two different things. One is there, they've started to greenlight mob culture. That's what it was scary here because this started out with a bot account who was spreading it through sort of liberal ideological culture who is trying to create an online model. But the reality is that online mob would have never reached critical mass, at least as it related to these kids without the blue check mark crowd saying, Yay, Yay, Yay. And that's the problem there. The green light for online mob behavior and that's why they have to be stopped and they have to correct their actions or they have to be remedied in court because they are the ones that are permitting it and expanding it. And for them, I don't know how often it's deliberate and how often to cultural mindset, I used to call it cotton ball culture. So in the south people used to go to the cotton ball. They're part of the privileged classes when they're 16 and 17 and they're sort of incorporated and acculturated to a certain mindset. So it's not that they all get together and conspire, but that they have a certain point of view that's, that's been created by the culture they share. And I think there's some of them online mob culture that's been festering over the past half decade, decade. And the worst part of it is that continued to be green light by institutional people or people with big platforms and big power.

Speaker 2:          11:10          Are you shocked also how the racial element has become so blatant? So it was like these kids are white. So you know, they have punchable faces or excusing the black Israelites to quizzes because they're black. So they can call these kids faggots. And that's okay. Even though you're supposed to defend gay people. But I guess if it's black people, you know, they created this oppression Olympics intersectional too. Yeah. This intersectional lunacy. So are you just shocked how, how solidified that is in so many people's brains

Speaker 3:          11:39          coordinator for like two different reasons. One, whenever I see people do it or raise it, my instinctual view is I was like, well, what does that person actually done for civil rights? So like when I'd been attacked, I'm like, well, I've done civil rights for 20 years. I've done very difficult cases in very difficult advocating for civil rights. So I was like, is this person really out there trying to help protect people? Or is it somebody who wants to, uh, social brownie points and social prestige point for being on the right political side? Um, and that's 95% of them. These are people that aren't actually doing anything to improve the wellbeing of African Americans. And Latinos in this country. The second part of it is it's become social prestige to uh, out people that are on that ever particular disfavored political class. And it happens to be the right now are disfavored political classes are by people are men are people of certain sort of parts of the country, certain political arena.

Speaker 2:          12:31          Dacian kids wearing Maga hats.

Speaker 3:          12:33          Exactly. I was like, that's the same sort of bigotry. The bigotry doesn't know color bigotry is bigotry and this has just racial bigotry disguised as a, as tried to protect people. They're not out to protect people. They're out to hurt and harm people and they just want to feel morally justified when they do it.

Speaker 2:          12:50          So when you now have to have to move forward on this lawsuit that you're saying you're going into not really cause you want to, you're giving these people a chance to go out. How does this even work logistically when you're going after people that have nothing to do with each other other than they all did it on the same platform.

Speaker 3:          13:05          So we're going to bring it as a class claim. So all the plaintiffs will be combined. So all 14 kids will be one group of plaintiffs and all the defendants will be combined. So the uh, so you can combine the defendants together when there's a common nucleus of facts and there are behaving in a coordinated way, even if it doesn't rise to the level of, say, illegal conspiracy or aiding and abetting, which it may in some of these instances, the effect of it is you can add them together because for judicial economy purposes, they're all part of the same event. And it's easier for one judge to preside over all the cases combined then the cases differently. Uh, and so it's interesting, some of the left media's client use use of these kinds of defamation claims has done used this exact procedure and it's time to use the exact procedure back the other way.

Speaker 2:          13:48          You gotta be careful what you wish for. Exactly. So let's talk a little bit about what's going on with Tucker Carlson right now. Now Tucker has been on this show, I go on his show every couple of weeks. I find them to be a decent guy. We have political disagreements that we have expressed to each other publicly before, but I think he's on the right side, especially when it comes to the free speech stuff now. Now media matters, which you mentioned already there, they're going after him. They're finding old audio clips on a shock. Jock, a Bubba, what's his name? Bubba. Bubba Gump, Blah Blah. So then Bubba,

Speaker 3:          14:19          is there any, I know it's got bubble and the bubble, that's something, right?

Speaker 2:          14:21          Yeah. Yeah. Whatever it is in effect a Howard Stern, like figure. Exactly where I was thinking. I tweeted something the other day that I wish Howard stern was maybe a little more engaged in these days. Ndas, I don't begrudge him. He's, he's lived through a lot and he's had, he's been a great fighter on our side of the free speech thing, but it's like if he was to take the 30 years of stuff that politicians, actors, Comedians, authors, musicians, everybody has said the crazy sexual acts that had been done in that. So you all those things and said you what this is all part of life, right? All say things we get in atmospheres. Where you joke differently this way, then you would that way. All of these things, I would love to help have him aiding us right now in this fight. So that's just one piece of this.

Speaker 2:          15:06          But putting that aside, media matters is now digging into old things of, of talkers. And you know, he apparently he said Faggot. There were a couple of other things and they're trying to make it sound like he's racist and he's for abusing kids and all of these things and I wonder what his legal recourses now he's not apologizing. That's one thing which I think that's pretty good for the, if you're going to stand against the mob, don't apologize. But also if there, because their goal is just to destroy this man, their goal is in some sort of legal justice, right? Their goal is their goal isn't to help anyone. Exactly. Right. Unless they're doing something that I can't figure out. Their goal is to destroy a man. And if you could destroy a man, you can destroy an idea and you can get all sorts of other people to shut up. So what the hell do we do?

Speaker 3:          15:51          It's very much a censorship shaming campaign designed to marginalize his audience and marginalize him from having access to his audience and to be an example to future people so that they won't, Hey, you better not come after a big tech, which is really what distinguishes Tucker from anyone else on Fox or anyone else in the political conservative space. He's probably the lead high profile person taking on big tech in this country. One of the leading guys saying, I think you're telling me I should have you on retainer. Is that where exactly? That's what's happening. It's a systematic, it's institutional. It's in, it's deliberate and it's obvious. So like I first got it familiar with this aspect of it in the context of representing Alex Jones, because I was trying to figure out why do people think he said a bunch of stuff that he actually didn't say or did things that he actually didn't do or think 90% of what he said was this as opposed to that. And it had found out watching Joe Rogan that it was actually a media matters thing that Joe Rogan himself walked. He's like, oh no, I saw this media matters thing was like who would trust media matters. It's like they, they're politically motivated, they're partisan oriented. They take various forms of like people complain about secret corporate cash and dark money. Media matters has tons of secret corporate cash and dark.

Speaker 2:          16:56          Is that, is that a big problem right here that the nonprofits now are probably, I don't know all the laws related to nonprofits, but they're probably in almost every political case stepping beyond their boundaries?

Speaker 3:          17:07          They definitely are and then what's happening is they're becoming clearly their partisan organizations, so here you have, nobody would think media matters is nonpartisan. I'm pretty sure they did

Speaker 2:          17:16          go after a joy reed on cable news when her whole thing went down about the anti gay blog posts.

Speaker 3:          17:20          Exactly. They've defended all kinds of people on the left who said, I'll come far worse things and at least are politically ideologically aligned with the left are supposed to be in the first instance and this is the left set of standards. That's something you say 20 years ago somehow means you can never have a public platform ever again. For the rest of your human existence. This is not an American standard. This is not a conservative standard. This has very much a left standard. The, but they don't apply it to their own people ever at all. I mean some of the things Joe Biden has said over the years, yeah, he's the leading Democratic candidate for the presidency and then guy opened his mouth and crazy stuff came over. Half the things that Trump says now, although he says them sloppily, are the exact same things that Obama said about immigration and Clinton said about immigration and Dianne Feinstein in the rest of them.

Speaker 3:          18:00          So the, it's extraordinary for the, for this sort of one side of application, but clearly Tucker is a target because Tucker is willing to take on big tech and the goal is they're testing when can we use something in the person's past. But what's extraordinary about all of this, what unites all of it, whether it's the Covington case or the Alex Jones case, is that you have people who are unwilling to debate ideas. It's all about if you disagree with them, then they're going to target you as an individual. They're going to make your life difficult as an individual. They're going to harass you as an individual stock. You as an individual. I've already been to Tucker's house by the way, precisely when his wife was there and had no clue what was going on and they're banging on the door and that was a reason why Fox went off Twitter for an extended time period.

Speaker 3:          18:37          Cause Twitter would do nothing about it. I mean the, the extraordinary discrepancy in disparity. Everybody can witness and everybody and people were like, Tim, pools on the left can say this is problematic. This is kind of obvious what you guys are doing and recognize how problematic it is because they're not going to stop there. It's like Alex Jones, they're not going to stop with Alex Jones. They're going to use it as an example to try to go after everyone else to scare and intimidate everyone else. You better not be in the independent press. You'd better not be in the independent speech. You better not be sharing a dissident narrative or we're going to be able to demonetize Yardi platform you a d bang you, uh, or, or defame you routinely and regularly and get away with. And that's why we need equalize the playing field. And, but for Tucker's case, what he could do, uh, is he could potentially go after media matters for misrepresenting or mischaracterizing the set of events.

Speaker 3:          19:24          They have a habit of putting out a video that decontextualizes what happened. They did it to Alex Jones. They would take them where he's talking about this subject put into a minute, uh, where it looks like he's talking about Sandy Hook is actually not, he's talking about something else. And they would say, these are all of the statements. So my, they've likely done the same thing to him, but there's limited remedies. I also saw one of, I think it was one of the directors of media matters. I actually retweeted it saying, if you think this is bad, we've got a lot more or something to that effect. And I thought this, they're, they're telling you how evil they are because they're saying we are releasing this information in a calculated way to destroy a man. We're not just, we're not just doing it for publicly like we found all this stuff and we're just going to put it all out there on day one because people should know about his path.

Speaker 3:          20:05          It's like we're going to keep the monster being fed so that it can keep feeding on correct and it's why are they so scared of ideas? If they think Tucker's wrong, an ideas debate his ideas, why attack him? Why especially why attack him on something he said 20 years ago on a shock jock show? There's also something crazy you could do. You could actually pick up the remote. You're not going to believe this. There's a button on that thing that allows you to scroll up or down. Have you seen this thing? Exactly. I mean if you don't like what you're hearing, you don't have to listen to it. If you think it's wrong, you should engage in. Years ago, Professor Lash, great historian passed away some years ago. He said, the reason why we expose our ideas and debate other people isn't necessarily to persuade them. It's because they're going to expose ideas that there are weaknesses in our argument.

Speaker 3:          20:47          And we often research a topic when somebody says, we got told that must be wrong and we go and find out about it would become more informed by engaging in the public debate process. And that's, that's good, that's healthy. But these are people who fundamentally don't believe in free thought, free expression and free speech. Fundamentally, they believe that you should have the right thought, not that you should have free thought, you should have the right expression, not that you should have free expression. They've combined sort of the inquisitional Catholic church with like 1920s communists and they've integrated the two in their approach. And they're using our legal system and using our political system and their superior power in the cultural, uh, areas of influence, whether it's Hollywood, whether it's big media, whether it's big tech to suppress and oppress those people who have different or dissonant views than them, including people on parts of the left. So I mean people like temple is being called a Nazi because he appears on Joe Rogan and ask a few questions at Twitter. I mean this is insanity.

Speaker 2:          21:42          So that's actually, I was going to go somewhere else, but let's jump there for a second. So like for example, when I had Tim Poolan last week, there were verified people on Twitter calling Tim a Nazi and Mia Fascists or me and Nazi and Tim, a fascist. I, I've mentioned this before. I've had an ah Ha, I grew up around Holocaust survivors. I lost family on both my mom and my dad's side.

Speaker 3:          22:01          Okay. Now again, I'm the free speech guy so I don't want to sue these people.

Speaker 2:          22:08          Is there some legal remedy for this if I was someone different than I am?

Speaker 3:          22:14          Correct, yeah, there is. Because for example, I took a couple of years ago, the Cassandra Fairbank's case, it gets a, and one of the I, one of the reasons I took it is, yeah,

Speaker 2:          22:23          I want send a former lefty, by the way, she's now all Trump, but former lefty. I had drinks with her one night. She gave me her full on lefty, lefty, lefty, lefty.

Speaker 3:          22:31          Yeah, exactly. Part Puerto Rican. And she was accused by Emma Roller, a flashing on white power gesture and this was the universal, just became a white power that was like so and so. She was on Twitter and he's like, I got to stop this, can somebody help me? And I said, I'll, I'll help for free because I liked the area of the case and thought needed to stop this because they're used to being able to say, I'll call someone and Nazi, I'll call someone a racist and that's not actionable at law. And I wanted to change that. I want him to say when you make very specific statements about someone's belief structure that someone can interpret in a jury can objective Lee verifies either true or false that I think that should be something you can sue over. So I brought the case in DC and we couldn't meet the actual malice standard, but the court said yes, saying someone is a racist in a particular way, like saying it's a white power gesture, you can be sued for the United States for liable.

Speaker 3:          23:23          And lies and under the defamation laws of DC, which are more restrictive than a lot of other laws. So that's established the standards. I always, people think I can just say anything and never get sued. That's what we're going to make the point in the Covington case. No you can't. If you say things that you know not to be true that a jury can look at and say I can objectives, we verify this. We the juries make determinations about whether someone is involved in a hate crime day. They make a determination whether someone has racially discriminatory animus or motivation every day. So if they're getting, if someone's accusing you of being a racist, that should be actionable in law because a jury can make that determination as a matter of objective fact and the fair banks case establishes precedent that you can under certain circumstances get legal remedy for that.

Speaker 2:          24:04          Got It. Will never cease to amaze me that the free speech crew or the people that have to do certain things through law exact such just to maintain free speech, which aside, it sounds so counter intuitive, but it's so fascinating to me. So a couple of times you've mentioned Fox, I think there's something interesting happening here. Now, has CNN or Msnbc ever put you on? No. Have they ever asked you to come on? CNN did way back about two years ago. Okay. So CNN did two years ago. MSNBC has not, Fox puts you on. Um, now fox only puts me on and they put me on with, no, I'd go on live shows. They don't tell me to say anything. I can say whatever the hell I want. I often bring up liberal Craig while I'm, while I'm on there. Uh, but it seems also clear to me that partly what's going on with the Tucker thing is that they are really going for Fox there. The plan is, all right, we'll take out Tucker. He's sort of the bravest or the most outspoken or whatever it is. But really then we'll make this about going for foxes licensing and broadcast abilities and everything else. You're nodding. So I suspect you agree with me, but I, I'm amazed because it's like there's so much lefty media and you never saw the right trying to destroy all the lefty immediate. There's basically one fox and it doesn't mean I love everything they're doing. I don't, but you need some counterbalanced don't. Yeah, absolutely. If

Speaker 3:          25:17          you have the approach of the inquisitional Catholic Church or institutional communism of a status variety, then what? What drives you crazy as the heresy so you don't look at it and say, Geez, how many fair balanced expressions do we have on both sides to the acquisitional Catholic Church? There's only in the Catholic church perspective and everybody else needs to be burned at the stake for the status Communist. Same dynamic there. One state channel, there's no alternative state channel. There's no anti state channel. So when you come at it from that perspective, what Unites, say Alex Jones, the Covington case and Fox is, these are three institutions and they represent different institutions that are giving an independent narrative. So when I was at Yale, we did a history project that was actually about why African Americans and poor whites in the south, we're often treated or, or portrayed and very discriminatory ways and cultural medium between 1,919 70 and what you find is that historically those communities have alternative narratives are grandparents and parents tell stories different than say the civics book version they learn in third grade in public school.

Speaker 3:          26:19          And so consequently those groups are often changed and censored and portrayed in a negative light so that the broader public audience wouldn't trust them to listen to them or a react to them. So the same thing as here. Like you look at the Covington kids, they represent private Catholic education. What is private? Catholic? Catholic education is one of the last institutions of independent thought compared to say all the public state schools and public institutions. So it drives him crazy that they, this institution that they can't control their thoughts and mind off, right? Because they don't have access to that instance. And then you even saw in the midst of all this, I'm sure you saw this, there was that guy from the New York Times who said, I want to know your stories. Remember, I forget what the Hashtag you used was, but he wanted to know your, you're Catholic.

Speaker 3:          26:57          It was like Hashtag Catholic schools stories precisely because let's now New York Times, let's go after them once we're done with this thing. So let's go after the whole Catholic church. Let's go after the Catholic schools because we need people to be afraid to be a part of those goals, to be ashamed. If they're connected to those schools, parents worry that if their skills are listed on their CV, their kids' futures will be impaired and not have these schools being independent sources of thought outside of the sort of cultural liberal, uh, uh, hegemonic view. And the same thing is true. Like Alex Jones represent sort of an independent part of the press. Uh, Fox News represents institutional part of the press that's independent, that expresses its own perspective. That's not part of the left majority. I mean, CNN and Msnbc and ABC and NBC. And CBS, even if they're using public airwaves are overwhelmingly on one side.

Speaker 3:          27:44          Same with PBS, same with NPR and there's a lot of good value and I watch all of them at different times or listened to them at different times, but I want the other side expressed and so why? It's this fear of free expression, this fear of free speech that's leading to these censorship campaigns, a shame campaigns, these targeting campaigns, these privacy invasion campaigns. When I've told people is if you're ever to the point where you're attacking a person or trying to shame a person trying to censor a person, trying to invade their privacy than what you're really looking, you're doing as you're looking in the mirror and telling yourself, I've failed on the argument, I can't persuade on ideas, no audience would actually believe my ideas. So it's an admission of failure and they're really resorting to these extreme tactics because they're recognizing they're losing in the public debate.

Speaker 3:          28:29          Do you think part of it also is that it's intentional? Not now, perhaps they're losing in the public debate. I think that's probably, you could debate that either way. On one hand I'm very enthused about sort of where we're at in this. On the other hand it's very scary too because you see this socialist, whatever the hell that is arising. So, but putting that aside, do you think part of it is that they're in doing it intentionally because they just want to basically uh, so chaos all over the place. That partly what they need for whatever their political goals are, they need the system that has been pretty freakin spectacular for 200 plus years to appear chaotic. So they, so they, what do they do? They sew chaos. It's very, what's amazing is how paralleled is the 1920 street violence in Europe. So you see like a lot of the communist tactics that were used back then and the fascist tactics that were used back then was in WWE were designed to sow distrust in the system.

Speaker 3:          29:18          So distrusted the institution. That's it protected. That's it. Every day. Now Aoc doing another thing about how evil we are in Reagan's evenly capitalism, capitalism to hate pedal. Marya. I think with like the combination you're talking about where there's these bad ideas that are spreading and yet winning in the public debate, what unites them is if both sides get presented, most people will take a humanitarian decision, will make a good choice based on their common experience in their comments sets. Whereas, and so that's why this side that wants to spread their ideas knows they can't allow that open, fair debate to happen or those institutions to be trusted and protected and respected. If they can. D If they can get people to no longer to not listen, to not hear independent voices, to be afraid to be a part of independent institutions, to feel ashamed if they're connected to it, to say, Hey, if I'm a lawyer, I represent this person, I'm going to be attacked.

Speaker 3:          30:06          If I'm, if I'm in the, in the public arena and I voiced an independent view, I'm going to be targeted and harassed and stalked and then the rest, they want people to be scared and intimidated to express their ideas because I think they know that in an in a non chaotic open debate structure, they don't win. And I think that's what the recommend because otherwise you don't have to resort to these ridiculous tactics and techniques. If your ideas are great and popular, you don't have to use chaotic techniques. You don't have to, uh, you don't have to try to censor people. You don't have to attack people. You don't have to say when to Tucker say 20 years ago on a, on a shock jock show, you can say, Hey, I disagree with what he said yesterday on Fox and I'm willing to debate them. And Tucker is one of the few people who says, Hey, you can come on the show and we'll debate

Speaker 2:          30:43          quite literally what it statement said exactly. If you don't like my ideas, let, let's talk about exactly. All right. So I want to ask you something that I think will sort of thread, oh, you know what, I want to ask you one other little tech thing and then, and then something that I think that will kind of bring us full circle here. So one of the things is, you know, you see me do this all the time where I have to publicly shame, uh, youtube in Thai, they're monetizing my video or making sure people aren't being unsubscribed to the rest of it and then ran a certain amount of people will say, but Dave, you're, you're a libertarian or whatever. You're not allowed to complain because you don't want the government involved, which is so idiotic because of course I'm using my voice as a citizen.

Speaker 2:          31:14          That's what you're supposed to do. Okay. Putting that aside, um, do you think there is some interesting legal mechanism if it was to be found out that they were treating traffic differently? So that's a little bit different than what we talked about earlier, was talking about content specifically. So you're saying this or that, but what if they're actually turning the screws just based on, uh, not something you said, but they have a general sort of a broad sense that they don't want certain ideas getting out there. I think there are contractual principals, equitable principles and consumer protection principles that are in play. So once you induce someone, yeah,

Speaker 3:          31:50          you participate in your platform and then you monetize their participation. To me, you have contractual obligations, a equitable obligations you can't have on just enrichment. So you say, Hey, if you participate, we, these are the rules. And if as long as you abide by those rules will make sure you share in the profits, for example, of monetizing your individual video. And if they don't do that, if they manipulate the algorithm, they misrepresent facts, they induce conduct and then only keep the profit for themselves or use it for a politicized purpose. That's different than what they said. Those are all consumer protection violations, equitable all violations and legal violations sometimes recommend a remedy by statutes, sometimes remedied by common law. Well, there's no reason for big tech to be above the law

Speaker 2:          32:32          right there. There might also be some legal thing related to their own board, right? I mean, if they're doing things that are not related, well, if they're not the most profitable thing, they're bored me. I don't know

Speaker 3:          32:41          exactly what it was. Right? Shareholders can take action, so they're going to be a derivative suits by shareholders. They could go to the board, but they can also bring derivative legal claims against the institution saying they're not promoting the best profit. They're creating undue legal risk and liability. They're not behaving in a matter consistent with their professional obligations and their contractual obligations to their, their own investors. And so they can also bring action. And in fact, the left leg went up. I told a lot of people is, look at what the left has done between the seventies. In 2000, you'll see a lot of legal roadmaps for how to go at what they're doing now. So they were with some of the, you know, the, uh, on the apartheid campaigns in South Africa, they targeted different people using shareholders suits using shareholder claims, using shareholder complaints to remedy that of people who are profiting from the apartheid system in South Africa. Why can't we do the same thing now based on the same legal theories, same factual predicates as the, as what's taking place here, which is inconsistent with their obligations and promises to people.

Speaker 2:          33:37          I guess partly in, this brings me to the, to the last question, it's partly about bravery. You need citizens who were brave enough. You need lawyers who are brave enough and they've created a system where everyone is afraid. Because the, when I go out speaking to college campuses or even I do Q and, a, when I'm doing standup or wherever I go, the question I get more than anything else is I'm afraid to say what I think and what should I do. And it's usually students that are saying I want to get a grade cause I want to get out, I want to get to Grad school or whatever. And I always think it's like, man, if everyone's thinking this, if we all just stopped, if we all just stopped acquiescing to it, we could actually change this thing like that. So my question to you is you, and you mentioned your father before, but why? Why are you willing to do this? Why are you willing to put your ass on the line? Where does this come from in you?

Speaker 3:          34:22          So it's two things. One, it's, it's growing up. So grew up poor in the south, got a scholarship to private schools, scholarship to Yale. When I was at Yale, they tried to get rid of poor students who were there, let a protest by leaving Yale in order to get them to reinstate their policies. And I saw there, I was like, I'm one kid, I'm 19 years old, I'm challenging all of Yale University, which wasn't exactly a small institution. And just by leaving the school and getting public attention for it, I got them to reverse their policies and protect poor students. Same access that I had to a rights to full financial aid rights to be treated in a nondiscriminatory manner in the application process. So as a, at a young age, I learned why one person can change the world. When I was a real little kid, I loved Medgar Evers and Medgar Evers had this great quote where they asked him why he wasn't afraid to die and he said, most men die a thousand deaths every day.

Speaker 3:          35:11          I'm only going to die once. And I was little kid. I was like, I want to be at Medgar Evers. It's like, that is so powerful. That is so important. That's so influential. And you realize that one person can make a difference. And when you realize one person can make a difference, if they know it here and act on it here, then you realize that that that's the power. That's the passion. That's what leads you to want to change the world, not be afraid of. I've had rogue agents threatened me, a IRS, people put me on audit every other year whenever I want a case. I've rogue judges threatened me. I've had people say that they were going to try to put me on a bogus criminal investigation. I've had every smear campaign known to man had bomb threats coming because of my Covington case representation, and none of it concerns me because if you understand that you really have the powers one person to make a real difference in the world, then other people will start to recognize that and they'll act on their power. They'll voice their, their abilities, they'll use their capabilities to make a meaningful difference, and that's how the world changes and that's how the world becomes a better place. That is how you end an interview. Can we smoke one of those cigars? He right here, right? We're done here. Follow Robert. I have a feeling you'll be back here. I have a feeling that's going to happen on Twitter at Barnes underscore law.
