00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:01.600
JENNY SCHIFFMAN: Thank you
guys so much for coming,

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:02.600
and welcome.

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.080
My name is Jenny
Schiffman, and I'm

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.300
thrilled to introduce
Ilyse Schapiro and Hallie

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.790
Rich to talk about
their best-selling book

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.250
"Should I Scoop Out My Bagel?"

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:12.260
They're going to answer a
lot of your burning questions

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:14.676
and things about nutrition
that you've been dying to know,

00:00:14.676 --> 00:00:16.420
which is perfect
timing for summer.

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:18.800
So Ilyse Schapiro, she's
a registered dietitian

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.960
and certified
dietitian nutritionist.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.430
She holds a master of
science in clinical nutrition

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.500
and dietetics from
New York University,

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.284
and resides in
Mamaroneck, New York.

00:00:27.284 --> 00:00:28.825
She's also one of
my closest friends.

00:00:28.825 --> 00:00:30.980
I'm personally very
thrilled that she's here.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.280
And Hallie Rich is a trailblazer
in the vitamin industry,

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.380
having created the award-winning
AlternaVites brand.

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.080
She received her BS with honors
from the University of Michigan

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.520
and resides in New York City.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.994
So with that, Ilyse and
Hallie, take it away.

00:00:43.994 --> 00:00:45.160
ILYSE SCHAPIRO: OK, perfect.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.590
Jenny, thank you so much, and
it's such an honor to be here.

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:49.815
We couldn't be more excited.

00:00:49.815 --> 00:00:52.190
And it's kind of crazy, because
I've grown up with Jenny,

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:53.600
so this is amazing.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.320
OK, so introducing the scoop.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.630
So why did we write this book?

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.399
Hallie and I kind of sat down
together a couple years ago.

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:03.940
We both said we want
to write a book,

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.315
but we couldn't figure out
what we wanted to write about.

00:01:06.315 --> 00:01:09.054
And at first it started out
very serious and very technical,

00:01:09.054 --> 00:01:10.970
and we both looked at
each other, and we said,

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:11.590
that's not us.

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.940
And that's not what
people need right now.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.710
There's too much stuff
out there that's,

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.070
you have to cut out gluten.

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.500
You have to cut out dairy.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.020
You have to do a juice cleanse.

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.416
And one week it's
butter is good for you.

00:01:23.416 --> 00:01:24.540
Butter is not good for you.

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.545
Eggs are good for you.

00:01:25.545 --> 00:01:26.670
Eggs are going to kill you.

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.670
So we decided to write
a book and kind of cut

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.671
through all the BS, and just
put it down all in one spot

00:01:34.671 --> 00:01:38.120
to give you the latest research
and the latest knowledge that's

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.170
out there today.

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.700
And there's pros and
cons to everything.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.180
And our book is a
guide to allow you

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.900
and empower you to
make smart decisions.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.750
Again, there's so much out
there, on the "Today" show.

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:51.390
You can get anything online.

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.220
So we're giving you
this information

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.500
to empower you to make
the best decisions

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.560
to live your best life.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.290
HALLIE RICH: It's not
about dictating to you

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.160
how to live your life.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.910
It's about saying
what's important to you

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:02.576
and then making those
healthy decisions.

00:02:02.576 --> 00:02:04.870
So if you love carbs,
don't cut out carbs.

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:06.740
But here's ways to
make smarter decisions.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.030
If you're onto protein or
you're afraid of gluten

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.735
or you haven't had
a full egg, you've

00:02:10.735 --> 00:02:12.530
only had egg whites
for the past 10 years,

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.930
we give you, not permission,
but the knowledge

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.690
and the information to just
do what's best for you.

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.846
And we kind of want to cut out
a lot of the misinterpretations

00:02:20.846 --> 00:02:22.470
out there, that food
is evil, that food

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:23.980
is a bad, four-letter word.

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.680
You know, food
should be enjoyed.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:26.660
You only live once.

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.600
We're all about
everything in moderation,

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.359
and just kind of pick your
vices on where you should enjoy

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:32.650
things and where you shouldn't.

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.680
Like we always say, I
can't go without carbs.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.140
Ilyse could give
up carbs tomorrow.

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.104
And it was kind of a
really nice mix when

00:02:39.104 --> 00:02:41.270
we were writing the book,
because we both came at it

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:42.460
from different ways.

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:44.887
But how do we both enjoy life
and how do we be healthy?

00:02:44.887 --> 00:02:46.220
And it's not about being skinny.

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.070
And one of the things when
we first wrote our book,

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.380
our first publisher
wanted to rename the book

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.410
and call it skinny
something or other.

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.210
And we actually left
that deal and started--

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:58.544
we worked with the publisher
we're with now, Skyhorse,

00:02:58.544 --> 00:03:00.210
because we were
uncomfortable with that.

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:01.320
It's not about being skinny.

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.250
It's not about losing the
most amount of weight.

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.416
It's about being the
healthiest version of yourself,

00:03:05.416 --> 00:03:07.216
and whatever that
is like to you.

00:03:07.216 --> 00:03:08.216
ILYSE SCHAPIRO: Exactly.

00:03:08.216 --> 00:03:08.727
Oh, good.

00:03:08.727 --> 00:03:09.560
So why listen to us?

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.850
Jenny gave a brief bio.

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.630
I have my masters
of science from NYU.

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.030
I'm a registered
dietitian, which

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.850
means I'm certified in New
York state and Connecticut

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:22.540
to practice, which is different
than being a health coach.

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.460
I have tons of schooling.

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:27.110
I have to maintain my continuing
ed credits every year.

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.330
And I have a private practice
in Harrison, New York

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:31.632
and Greenwich, Connecticut.

00:03:31.632 --> 00:03:33.715
HALLIE RICH: I'm the third
generation in my family

00:03:33.715 --> 00:03:35.930
to be in the vitamin
industry, so I-- really

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:37.320
actually in my genes.

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:38.779
And really how we
came together, we

00:03:38.779 --> 00:03:40.819
were introduced through
a friend to work together

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:43.030
with my vitamin company
and Ilyse's practice.

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.831
But what's kind of interesting
is the reason why you eat,

00:03:46.831 --> 00:03:48.330
the reason why you
take supplements,

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:49.510
is all about the nutrients.

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.920
So whether it's the vitamins,
the minerals, the antioxidants,

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.170
whatever it is you're
getting, you're

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:54.462
trying to get the same benefit.

00:03:54.462 --> 00:03:56.170
So we actually have
a lot more in common.

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.220
It's just a matter of,
where do you get it from?

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:59.679
And I'm of the
belief, as is Ilyse,

00:03:59.679 --> 00:04:01.761
obviously you want to try
to get the most that you

00:04:01.761 --> 00:04:02.429
can from food.

00:04:02.429 --> 00:04:03.970
But whatever you
can't get from food,

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.489
you want to try to supplement
with whatever product

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:07.530
it is that works for you.

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.100
And that's how we work so
well, because we both know

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:10.430
enough about the nutrients.

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.609
It's just a matter of
where you source them from.

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:13.400
ILYSE SCHAPIRO: OK.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.060
All right, so we've got
Rainbow Bagels in the back.

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.206
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:18.206 --> 00:04:19.565
All right, Hallie.

00:04:19.565 --> 00:04:21.459
HALLIE RICH: So about
scooping your bagel,

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:22.500
does everyone here scoop?

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.020
Do people not scoop?

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:25.180
Are you into scooping?

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:26.096
ILYSE SCHAPIRO: Right.

00:04:26.096 --> 00:04:27.540
What do we think about scooping?

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:28.230
HALLIE RICH: We're in New York.

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:29.066
Everyone has to eat bagels.

00:04:29.066 --> 00:04:29.960
How do you eat them?

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.367
Plain, not plain?

00:04:31.367 --> 00:04:33.450
All right, well, so obviously
the name of our book

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:34.610
is "Should I Scoop My Bagel?"

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.151
And if you're looking
to lose weight,

00:04:36.151 --> 00:04:38.190
the answer is yes, you
should scoop your bagel.

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:39.670
The most important thing,
though, with scooping,

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:41.720
is not, when you scoop out
the middle, to eat the middle.

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:42.930
Make sure you throw it out.

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.013
Otherwise there's absolutely
no point in scooping.

00:04:45.013 --> 00:04:47.082
A good other thing
to do is to toast it,

00:04:47.082 --> 00:04:48.540
because it makes
it really crunchy.

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.630
You don't really see that
you're missing things.

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:52.213
The other most
important thing is just

00:04:52.213 --> 00:04:53.700
not to pour everything in there.

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:55.890
It doesn't become a boat
for you to put extra stuff,

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:58.480
kind of top it off at
the top with a scoop.

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.065
Great things for there would
be peanut butter, turkey, even

00:05:01.065 --> 00:05:04.661
like a pizza bagel, low-fat
tuna, grilled chicken.

00:05:04.661 --> 00:05:07.160
You can make anything you want
of it, because at that point,

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.159
it's kind of just bread.

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:10.102
And then if you
don't want to scoop,

00:05:10.102 --> 00:05:12.060
if you're at a business
meeting, if you're here

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.570
enjoying your
Rainbow Bagels, just

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:18.292
have half a bagel, a
flagel, a little flat.

00:05:18.292 --> 00:05:20.000
Anything like that is
a great alternative

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.090
if you don't want
to scoop and you're

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:22.320
trying to watch your weight.

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:23.236
ILYSE SCHAPIRO: Right.

00:05:23.236 --> 00:05:23.770
OK, good.

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:25.660
And some people
have said to us, why

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.840
would you have bagels at talks?

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.400
But again, we're about
everything in moderation.

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.180
So enjoy.

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:31.730
Have fun.

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:34.180
And the Rainbow Bagel place
in Brooklyn is amazing.

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.550
It has been amazing to us.

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:39.180
OK, so some quick bites,
some quick things.

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.560
Again, these
questions we came up

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.350
between peers and colleagues,
and for me sometimes it

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:48.330
was somebody at the gym coming
up to me, or my client saying,

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:49.230
what should I do?

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:52.630
And even actually, I was
a huge believer for years,

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:56.390
I thought blotting my pizza
would save a ton of calories.

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:57.490
In fact, it doesn't.

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:59.500
So just enjoy your pizza.

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:04.390
The grease that you soak up only
accounts for 20 to 50 calories.

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:07.652
And you're really only actually
soaking up the moisture.

00:06:07.652 --> 00:06:09.360
So we say, you know
what, if you're going

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.750
to have pizza, that's fine.

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:13.489
Don't think you're saving
hundreds of calories

00:06:13.489 --> 00:06:14.530
by soaking up the grease.

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:15.880
Park a little bit further away.

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:19.010
Or if you're in New York,
walk a couple of extra blocks,

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:22.519
because I think some people
misinterpret, oh, I just

00:06:22.519 --> 00:06:24.810
soaked up the grease, so I
can have two to three slices

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:26.590
because I'm saving
tons of calories.

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:30.300
And then another thing
that comes up all the time,

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:33.080
and I'm a huge just
only egg white eater,

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:34.490
more because I just prefer it.

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:35.948
I don't like the
taste of the yolk.

00:06:35.948 --> 00:06:38.040
But whole eggs are
making a comeback.

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:40.200
Years ago, everybody was
cutting out the yolk.

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.950
It causes high cholesterol,
causes heart disease.

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:45.850
Actually, they're saying
now research says it's not.

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:47.987
If you do have a family
history or personal history

00:06:47.987 --> 00:06:49.570
of high cholesterol,
then yes, I would

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:53.460
keep your egg yolks limited,
maybe once or twice a week.

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:55.977
But if you have no family
history or personal history

00:06:55.977 --> 00:06:58.310
of high cholesterol, you don't
have to cut out the yolk.

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:00.680
You don't have to be, like
me, that annoying person

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:04.770
in the diner saying, can I have
an egg white only omelette.

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:05.599
It's OK.

00:07:05.599 --> 00:07:06.140
Eat the yolk.

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:08.210
And the yolk actually
has all the vitamins.

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:12.480
It has vitamins A, D, E, and
K, though egg white is great.

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:13.270
It has protein.

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:14.680
It has magnesium.

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:17.090
And one thing that we found
out as we were doing this,

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:19.020
especially since I'm
the egg white person,

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:22.590
if you buy the fancy omega-3
eggs, which are great,

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:25.110
you actually only get the
benefits of the omega-3's

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:26.450
if you eat the yolk.

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:28.555
So otherwise, if you're
an egg white only person,

00:07:28.555 --> 00:07:31.180
just by the regular cheap eggs,
because otherwise you're just--

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:31.890
HALLIE RICH: Really
expensive egg whites.

00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:32.890
ILYSE SCHAPIRO: Right.

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:33.973
You're wasting your money.

00:07:33.973 --> 00:07:37.650
All right, frozen yogurt
is better than ice cream.

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:40.460
Who's a fro-yo person out there?

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:46.240
The big 16 Handles, or some
of those self-serve places.

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:49.330
And again, for years
I was fro-yo girl.

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:50.760
You know, it has less calories.

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:53.670
I can eat as much as I want.

00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:56.210
Now, especially with
those self-serve places

00:07:56.210 --> 00:08:01.024
and you can just put
in like 16 ounces,

00:08:01.024 --> 00:08:03.440
sometimes you're just better
off having just a small scoop

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:04.935
of ice cream.

00:08:04.935 --> 00:08:06.680
The small scoop of
ice cream is going

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:10.870
to be way more satisfying
than 16 ounces of air.

00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:14.310
And also, at the fro-yo
places, I mean, I'm guilty too.

00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:15.720
You put on tons of toppings.

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:17.840
They taste delicious,
but before you know it,

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:20.380
your fro-yo which you
think is super healthy

00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:23.550
can be 600, 700, 800 calories.

00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:25.992
So again, if you like
fro-yo, enjoy it.

00:08:25.992 --> 00:08:27.700
Just try and keep the
portion sizes down,

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:30.520
because ounce for ounce,
it's actually similar.

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:33.809
And the regular ice cream
would be more satisfying.

00:08:33.809 --> 00:08:35.559
HALLIE RICH: It's got
your full-fat dairy,

00:08:35.559 --> 00:08:37.062
so you're gonna
be more satisfied.

00:08:37.062 --> 00:08:38.020
You're gonna be fuller.

00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:42.789
And in the book we make an
analogy to that fake purse

00:08:42.789 --> 00:08:43.461
that you buy.

00:08:43.461 --> 00:08:44.410
First you love it.

00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:46.100
Then you see all of
its imperfections.

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:47.680
Then you're like, why'd I
spend all the money on this?

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:49.429
Kind of the same thing
with frozen yogurt.

00:08:49.429 --> 00:08:49.940
You see it.

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:50.980
It seems refreshing.

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:52.080
It seems satisfying.

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:53.395
But then by the time
you're done, you're like,

00:08:53.395 --> 00:08:54.769
oh, I have the
worst stomachache.

00:08:54.769 --> 00:08:55.290
I have gas.

00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:57.590
I'm never going to eat it
again, until the next day.

00:08:57.590 --> 00:08:59.582
Just kind of be careful with it.

00:08:59.582 --> 00:09:05.344
It's deceivingly nutritious, and
it's just a lot of chemicals.

00:09:05.344 --> 00:09:06.260
ILYSE SCHAPIRO: Right.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:07.760
And I've also had
clients say to me,

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:10.950
oh, Ilyse, I went out for 16
Handles, and then I came home

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:12.860
and I ate-- like,
I was still hungry

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:15.560
and I ate a bag of M&amp;M's,
or I ate a couple of Oreos

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:19.520
because it just-- it
didn't fill me up enough.

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:22.090
So multigrain instead
of white bread.

00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:24.212
So I think multigrain
bread is great,

00:09:24.212 --> 00:09:25.920
but you have to know
what you're getting.

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:28.850
I think a lot of people
don't read the labels

00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:30.880
and assume just because
something's multigrain,

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:32.410
it's actually just as good.

00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:34.480
You know, it's whole grain.

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:36.960
But sometimes multigrain
is just a bunch of grains,

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:38.780
and it's not 100% whole grain.

00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:41.480
So you have to make sure
you read labels, again,

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:44.060
if this is something that
you are concerned about.

00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:47.240
You need to make sure you read
labels, because in some cases

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:50.240
multigrain bread that you buy
in the supermarket package could

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:51.510
be equivalent to white bread.

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:53.540
HALLIE RICH: They just
use some food colorings

00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:54.500
like caramel and stuff.

00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:55.550
ILYSE SCHAPIRO: Right.

00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:55.990
HALLIE RICH: It looks healthy.

00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:57.073
I mean, I was that person.

00:09:57.073 --> 00:09:58.530
I bought multigrain
all the time.

00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:00.071
Now, after researching
for this book,

00:10:00.071 --> 00:10:01.710
I only buy 100%
whole wheat bread,

00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:03.550
just because that's
something that, one, I

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:05.220
think it's more satisfying.

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:06.840
It has more fiber in it.

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:08.500
But I also don't
need all the caramel.

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:10.791
It's white bread with caramel
and some nuts on the top.

00:10:10.791 --> 00:10:12.170
You know, it's
not what you think

00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:13.170
you're necessarily getting.

00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:13.573
ILYSE SCHAPIRO: Right.

00:10:13.573 --> 00:10:13.976
Right.

00:10:13.976 --> 00:10:15.517
So you need to make
sure on the label

00:10:15.517 --> 00:10:18.370
it says 100% whole
wheat, 100% whole grain,

00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:21.000
or that the first ingredient
is whole wheat or whole wheat

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.020
flour.

00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:25.316
HALLIE RICH: So sushi--
we've all had sushi,

00:10:25.316 --> 00:10:26.690
whether it's after
work at night,

00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:27.773
you order it to your desk.

00:10:27.773 --> 00:10:29.650
You probably have it here.

00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:30.820
You think it's small bites.

00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:31.380
It's healthy.

00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:31.880
It's good.

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:34.670
It's a nice balance
of fish and carbs.

00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:36.660
But it's kind of
none of those things.

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:38.160
Actually, the rice
that they usually

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:41.814
use for sushi, pardon me,
is full of salt and sugar.

00:10:41.814 --> 00:10:44.480
So you're actually getting a lot
more calories just in the rice.

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:46.396
Forget about anything
else that you're eating.

00:10:46.396 --> 00:10:48.900
And I don't know how many
of you, but you have sushi,

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:50.630
you're so full, and
then like a half hour

00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:52.720
later, you're starving
and you have no idea why.

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:55.120
And a lot of times that's
because-- forget about the sake

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:57.164
bombs for a second--
because a lot of times it's

00:10:57.164 --> 00:10:58.580
because you're
totally dehydrated.

00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:01.440
And that's because of the salt
and the sugar in the rice.

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:02.950
So that's your first problem.

00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:06.220
And also, dehydration, the
symptoms of dehydration

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:07.510
mimics hunger.

00:11:07.510 --> 00:11:09.660
So if you're ever really
hungry and that happens,

00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:10.860
have a big glass of water.

00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:11.535
Wait 15 minutes.

00:11:11.535 --> 00:11:13.410
You're probably not
going to be hungry again,

00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:15.535
because your body was
probably just thirsty instead

00:11:15.535 --> 00:11:16.360
of being hungry.

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:18.320
But back to sushi anyway.

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:20.810
Start with a small
something-- edamame,

00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:22.970
a salad with
dressing on the side.

00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:25.400
Try hand rolls if you can,
because again, the rice

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:27.630
seems to be a big culprit
of why you're not hungry

00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:30.640
and why it's not so filling and
why it has so many calories.

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:34.369
Just one or two rolls could have
over 1,000 calories to them.

00:11:34.369 --> 00:11:36.660
So it's a big part of your
day, and it's not as healthy

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:38.595
as you originally
thought it was.

00:11:38.595 --> 00:11:40.930
You can try something
like chicken teriyaki

00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:43.302
or any of those dishes,
which are a nice alternative.

00:11:43.302 --> 00:11:44.010
And try to share.

00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:45.400
I mean, most of the when
you go out for sushi,

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:46.608
there's more than one of you.

00:11:46.608 --> 00:11:48.830
Get rolls that you like,
have a little bit of them,

00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:50.700
and then get something
on the side that's

00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:51.852
a little bit healthier.

00:11:51.852 --> 00:11:54.060
ILYSE SCHAPIRO: This is one
of my favorite questions,

00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:56.745
and it comes up in my
office all the time.

00:11:56.745 --> 00:11:58.595
Ilyse, should I cut out gluten?

00:11:58.595 --> 00:11:59.970
Do you have a
gluten sensitivity?

00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:00.650
Do have celiac?

00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:01.150
No.

00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:04.230
My friend just told me I should
cut out gluten, or whatever.

00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:06.500
It's never from a doctor
or a registered dietitian.

00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:07.340
My friend said this.

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:08.060
My aunt said this.

00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:08.780
My sister said this.

00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:09.613
My cousin said that.

00:12:09.613 --> 00:12:12.590
So that's something that comes
up in my office constantly.

00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:15.440
And I'm not discounting
that some people do have

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:19.000
a real sensitivity to gluten.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.670
And I totally respect
and honor that.

00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:22.670
But I think sometimes
people just cut out gluten

00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:24.746
because they think
it's the thing to do.

00:12:24.746 --> 00:12:25.870
Everybody else is doing it.

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:26.365
It's a fad.

00:12:26.365 --> 00:12:27.550
HALLIE RICH: New Atkins diet.

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:28.841
ILYSE SCHAPIRO: Right, exactly.

00:12:28.841 --> 00:12:32.360
And sometimes it actually
messes you up, to be honest.

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:34.153
So gluten is a
specific protein found

00:12:34.153 --> 00:12:35.236
in wheat, rye, and barley.

00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:40.220
If you want to cut
out carbs or go

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:43.020
low carb, which is actually
the type of lifestyle I live,

00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:43.540
that's fine.

00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:44.150
Do that.

00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:45.733
But if you're going
to cut out gluten,

00:12:45.733 --> 00:12:47.120
it actually goes
way beyond that.

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:50.590
Gluten is found in instant
coffee, grain alcohol,

00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:53.680
soy sauce, mustards, dressings.

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:55.800
And I think a lot of
people, they say to me,

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:57.300
oh, well, I'm eating so healthy.

00:12:57.300 --> 00:12:58.990
I had gluten-free
pretzels as a snack.

00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:00.750
Well, a gluten-free
pretzel is still a pretzel,

00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:02.541
and a gluten-free cookie
is still a cookie.

00:13:02.541 --> 00:13:05.020
And they still have calories
and they still have fat.

00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:06.570
And believe it or
not, actually, when

00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:08.980
they make these gluten-free
products, because there's

00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:10.550
no gluten in it,
they have to fill it

00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:13.700
with fillers and tapioca flour.

00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:16.490
So again, gluten-free
pretzels, gluten-free bread,

00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:18.760
if you need it, fine.

00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:20.450
But just doing it
to do it, sometimes

00:13:20.450 --> 00:13:22.033
people actually end
up gaining weight,

00:13:22.033 --> 00:13:23.392
because they're doing it wrong.

00:13:23.392 --> 00:13:25.850
And if you're going to go strict
gluten-free, which, again,

00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:27.930
is fine if it's
indicated, I wouldn't

00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:30.090
recommend using many
of those products,

00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:31.090
because there's fillers.

00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:31.900
It's more fat.

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:34.324
There's no fiber, so you're
not going to feel that full.

00:13:34.324 --> 00:13:35.740
HALLIE RICH: And
some things claim

00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:37.010
to be gluten free
that were always

00:13:37.010 --> 00:13:37.860
gluten free to begin with.

00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:38.380
ILYSE SCHAPIRO: Right.

00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:40.410
HALLIE RICH: So it's
not necessarily a sign

00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:42.659
that it's better
than an alternative.

00:13:42.659 --> 00:13:44.450
It just might have
always been gluten-free.

00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:45.366
ILYSE SCHAPIRO: Right.

00:13:45.366 --> 00:13:46.230
Exactly.

00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:48.790
Anyone here cut out
gluten because they

00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:52.640
hear it's the thing to do or
they feel like it's trendy?

00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:53.650
OK, good, no.

00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:56.530
That makes me so happy to hear.

00:13:56.530 --> 00:13:57.220
I eat gluten.

00:13:57.220 --> 00:13:58.240
I eat dairy.

00:13:58.240 --> 00:13:59.920
I tell people that all the time.

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:01.400
And the next thing is dairy.

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:03.900
And again, if you have a
legit medical condition,

00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:05.140
or some people say,
you know what, Ilyse,

00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:06.180
dairy just really bloats me.

00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:07.270
I just don't feel
good with dairy.

00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:08.120
Then don't eat it.

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:10.850
But to cut out dairy
just because you

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:13.100
think it's going to help you
lose weight doesn't work.

00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:13.760
I eat dairy.

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:14.430
I eat yogurt.

00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:15.056
I eat cheese.

00:14:15.056 --> 00:14:18.110
I eat all that stuff
on a daily basis.

00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:22.060
So eliminating dairy alone
won't help you move the scale.

00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:25.200
And dairy has tons of benefits.

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:26.600
It contains vitamins
and minerals

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:28.380
like calcium,
vitamin D, protein.

00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:30.360
It obviously supports
strong bones.

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:32.180
And it has the
protein, which helps

00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:33.370
to prevent you overeating.

00:14:33.370 --> 00:14:36.350
I mean, my biggest thing, I'm
like, I love Greek yogurt.

00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:38.470
It has 18 to 20 grams
of protein in it.

00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:39.690
It's a great afternoon snack.

00:14:39.690 --> 00:14:41.700
It's a great breakfast.

00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:45.034
So I'm all about
gluten and dairy.

00:14:45.034 --> 00:14:46.950
And like I said, without
a medical indication,

00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:50.800
there's really no
reason to cut it out.

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:53.230
Cleanses-- so
everybody is always

00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:55.140
looking for that
thing that's going

00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:59.810
to help them drop five pounds
or clean up their diet.

00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:02.400
But to be honest,
they don't work.

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:03.230
You get hungry.

00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:04.250
You get cranky.

00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:05.750
Yes, you'll lose a
couple of pounds,

00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:07.666
but then the second you
start eating normally,

00:15:07.666 --> 00:15:11.020
which 99.99% of people
have to start doing,

00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:12.559
you'll gain the weight back.

00:15:12.559 --> 00:15:13.850
HALLIE RICH: And maybe more so.

00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:16.735
ILYSE SCHAPIRO: And
maybe more so sometimes.

00:15:16.735 --> 00:15:18.667
Your body already is
doing the cleanse.

00:15:18.667 --> 00:15:20.250
I think a lot of
people misunderstand.

00:15:20.250 --> 00:15:23.850
We have our liver, our
kidneys, our digestive system,

00:15:23.850 --> 00:15:25.210
which are all natural filters.

00:15:25.210 --> 00:15:26.626
Some people are
like, well, I just

00:15:26.626 --> 00:15:29.070
want to clean out all
the toxins in my body.

00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:30.640
You can do that
in a healthy way.

00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:31.860
Don't drink alcohol.

00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:35.260
Don't eat processed foods.

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:36.940
Cut out artificial sweeteners.

00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:40.840
That's a huge one,
including Truvia and stevia,

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:42.040
which we'll get too later.

00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:43.440
Cut out the refined carbs.

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:44.660
Cut out the white stuff.

00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:45.760
Definitely exercise.

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:49.140
And focus on fruits,
vegetables, and clean protein.

00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:54.036
So I think the cleanses can
be expensive and kind of not

00:15:54.036 --> 00:15:54.535
necessary.

00:15:57.670 --> 00:16:01.200
HALLIE RICH: Protein bars-- so
a lot of us are really busy.

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:04.010
We grab protein bars, whether
before the gym, after the gym.

00:16:04.010 --> 00:16:04.677
We're traveling.

00:16:04.677 --> 00:16:06.634
We don't have enough
time, running to meetings.

00:16:06.634 --> 00:16:07.520
We eat protein bars.

00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:09.510
But you know, they're
not a meal replacement.

00:16:09.510 --> 00:16:11.810
So once in a while, if it's
something you want to have,

00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:14.130
you just need the nourishment,
you're running around,

00:16:14.130 --> 00:16:14.750
it's fine.

00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:18.450
But don't keep looking at
them as meal replacements.

00:16:18.450 --> 00:16:20.806
A lot of times there's
a lot more fat and sugar

00:16:20.806 --> 00:16:21.430
than you would.

00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:22.960
You're missing a
lot of the nutrients

00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:25.293
that you would be getting
just from the actual food that

00:16:25.293 --> 00:16:26.670
has the actual protein in it.

00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:28.720
They're made with some
soy protein isolates,

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:30.510
which aren't always
exactly the best thing

00:16:30.510 --> 00:16:32.320
to be having as well.

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:37.020
And they're just-- there
are many bars out there that

00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:40.220
are marketed as protein bars
that you would be better off

00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:40.970
having a Snickers.

00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:43.234
You know, Snickers actually
has real peanuts in it.

00:16:43.234 --> 00:16:44.150
It has real chocolate.

00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:45.442
There's not a lot of chemicals.

00:16:45.442 --> 00:16:47.817
And you'd be surprised by
looking at the nutrition facts.

00:16:47.817 --> 00:16:50.120
If you took a Snickers and
you took a protein bar,

00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:51.170
if we showed you
the back of them,

00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:53.086
you'd be surprised to
know that you'd probably

00:16:53.086 --> 00:16:56.056
pick the Snickers bar as the one
as being the protein bar, not

00:16:56.056 --> 00:16:57.430
the actual protein
bar, depending

00:16:57.430 --> 00:16:59.330
upon the brand out there.

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:02.400
Brands that we like-- Think
Thin, Quest, Pure Protein,

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:06.180
they tend to have a lot of
protein, a little sugar,

00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:07.430
a little fat, little calories.

00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:09.099
So not that we're
plugging anybody,

00:17:09.099 --> 00:17:10.765
but we like those,
because people always

00:17:10.765 --> 00:17:12.329
ask us which brands we do like.

00:17:12.329 --> 00:17:14.950
But you really want to watch
the ratio there and make sure

00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:17.270
that you're actually
getting a lot of protein

00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:19.417
and less of everything else.

00:17:19.417 --> 00:17:20.880
ILYSE SCHAPIRO: OK, good.

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:22.000
All right, organic.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.609
Who in this room tries to
buy organic, even if it's

00:17:24.609 --> 00:17:27.450
for some of some things?

00:17:27.450 --> 00:17:28.089
All good.

00:17:28.089 --> 00:17:28.950
Perfect.

00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:32.600
So we're here to tell you there
are certain things you should

00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:34.300
or try to buy organic,
and then there

00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:36.670
are some things you don't
have to stress out about,

00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:39.090
one of them being bananas,
which actually happens to not

00:17:39.090 --> 00:17:41.209
be on here, but a lot of
people say, oh my God,

00:17:41.209 --> 00:17:42.250
I bought organic bananas.

00:17:42.250 --> 00:17:43.791
I'm like, you just
wasted your money.

00:17:43.791 --> 00:17:46.780
Anything with a thick skin,
you don't need to buy organic.

00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:49.770
But there are plenty of things
that the Environmental Working

00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:54.180
Group, which is the EWG,
which this changes every year,

00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:56.500
recommends that you buy organic.

00:17:56.500 --> 00:18:00.260
So huge ones-- the dirty dozen--
apples, celery, cherries,

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:02.710
cucumbers, which I actually
just recently switched

00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:03.585
to organic cucumbers.

00:18:03.585 --> 00:18:05.030
They taste different.

00:18:05.030 --> 00:18:08.660
Grapes, nectarines,
peaches, snap peas, spinach,

00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:10.910
strawberries, sweet bell
peppers, and tomatoes.

00:18:10.910 --> 00:18:13.880
Those are the ones that they
say have the highest pesticide

00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:16.340
residue, and you should
aim to buy organic.

00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:18.350
Now, the cleanest
fruits and veggies

00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:20.740
that you don't have to waste
your money on-- asparagus,

00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:24.920
avocado, cabbage, cantaloupe,
cauliflower, eggplant,

00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:29.650
grapefruit, honeydew,
mangoes, kiwi, onions, papaya,

00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:32.900
pineapple, sweet
corn, and sweet peas.

00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:36.610
And if you don't have
access to organic,

00:18:36.610 --> 00:18:37.850
look for local produce.

00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:40.700
It's easy to buy, actually,
frozen organic fruits

00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:42.950
and vegetables in
the supermarket,

00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:46.370
and those are just
as good for you.

00:18:46.370 --> 00:18:48.080
Some things that are
not necessary to buy

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:49.990
organic-- breads, cookies.

00:18:49.990 --> 00:18:53.720
Again, an organic cookie
is still a cookie.

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:57.820
And you want to look for
the USDA organic label

00:18:57.820 --> 00:18:59.560
for 100% organic products.

00:19:02.449 --> 00:19:03.490
HALLIE RICH: So alcohol--

00:19:03.490 --> 00:19:04.789
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:04.789 --> 00:19:06.580
--we know that you guys
are going to drink,

00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:08.630
and we're here to show
you how to do that

00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:10.630
in the healthiest way possible.

00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:12.637
Alcohol has no nutritional
value whatsoever,

00:19:12.637 --> 00:19:14.970
so don't think just because
you're having a pina colada,

00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:17.799
for example, and it's made
with coconuts, that you're

00:19:17.799 --> 00:19:19.090
going to get something from it.

00:19:19.090 --> 00:19:20.690
Doesn't really work that way.

00:19:20.690 --> 00:19:24.420
Apple pie doesn't really give
you the benefits of the apples.

00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:28.099
So kind of pick your alcohols
intelligently, if you would,

00:19:28.099 --> 00:19:29.640
if you're trying to
watch your weight

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:31.070
and that's important to you.

00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:34.300
A six-ounce glass of wine
only has 150 calories.

00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:37.379
The same size pina colada has
three times, or 450 calories.

00:19:37.379 --> 00:19:39.920
So again, if you're sitting on
the beach and your feet are up

00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:41.629
and you're on a lounge
chair at the pool,

00:19:41.629 --> 00:19:44.003
we're not going to tell you
not to have your pina colada.

00:19:44.003 --> 00:19:46.539
But maybe don't have a bunch,
and don't have them every day.

00:19:46.539 --> 00:19:48.580
Just kind of be careful,
especially of the things

00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:51.079
with the sugar around the rim
or the little pretty umbrellas

00:19:51.079 --> 00:19:51.752
in them.

00:19:51.752 --> 00:19:53.460
They're so pretty
because they're masking

00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:54.715
what's really inside of them.

00:19:54.715 --> 00:19:56.090
If you're going
to have beer, try

00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:57.900
to stick with your
ultra-low-carb beer.

00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:00.880
Mixed drinks, try to
stick with one mixer.

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:03.252
Best mixers would be a seltzer.

00:20:03.252 --> 00:20:04.710
Try to avoid the
fruit juice, which

00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:07.590
we'll get into in a
second about fruit juices.

00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:11.144
If you don't like your alcohol
with it, just have a splash.

00:20:11.144 --> 00:20:13.060
It will really cut down
on calories and sugar,

00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:15.310
and you'll probably enjoy
the drink a little bit more.

00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:17.180
And you'll need
less because you're

00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:18.610
having more of the alcohol.

00:20:18.610 --> 00:20:20.870
And ounce for ounce, the
stronger the alcohol,

00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:23.195
the more calories
there are in there.

00:20:23.195 --> 00:20:25.070
So you probably hopefully
don't need as much,

00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:26.403
because the alcohol is stronger.

00:20:26.403 --> 00:20:28.560
But just be mindful of that.

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:30.196
So that's the deal with alcohol.

00:20:30.196 --> 00:20:32.070
ILYSE SCHAPIRO: All right.

00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:33.700
And did you talk
about the proof?

00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:34.080
HALLIE RICH: Yeah.

00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:34.871
ILYSE SCHAPIRO: OK.

00:20:34.871 --> 00:20:35.769
All right, breakfast.

00:20:35.769 --> 00:20:38.060
HALLIE RICH: Cereal-- so I
think we've all kind of been

00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:40.342
ingrained that Saturday
morning or what

00:20:40.342 --> 00:20:42.300
used to be Saturday
morning cartoon cereals are

00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:44.320
the things that should
definitely be avoided.

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:45.653
You know, they're very colorful.

00:20:45.653 --> 00:20:47.930
They're full of sugar,
artificial colors, sweeteners,

00:20:47.930 --> 00:20:49.479
flavors, and dyes.

00:20:49.479 --> 00:20:51.520
But what's so interesting
is that the things that

00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:55.066
are marketed towards
you are actually,

00:20:55.066 --> 00:20:56.690
I don't want to use
the word way worse,

00:20:56.690 --> 00:20:59.639
but have a lot more sugar and
a lot more calories and a lot

00:20:59.639 --> 00:21:00.930
more dyes than you would think.

00:21:00.930 --> 00:21:02.880
Out of all these
cereals up there,

00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:05.040
would someone tell me
which ones they would avoid

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:06.415
or which ones they
would lean to,

00:21:06.415 --> 00:21:08.359
or which ones they actually eat?

00:21:08.359 --> 00:21:09.900
Anyone know which
has the most sugar?

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:15.620
All right, well, Raisin
Bran has the most sugar.

00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:16.712
It has 18 grams of sugar.

00:21:16.712 --> 00:21:17.670
ILYSE SCHAPIRO: I know.

00:21:17.670 --> 00:21:19.390
I love the confusion
in the room.

00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:21.220
HALLIE RICH: Followed
by Smart Start and Go

00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:24.190
Lean, which have 14 grams
and 13 grams, respectively.

00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:26.690
Your Cinnamon Toast Crunch,
your Mini Wheats, and your Fruit

00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:27.950
Loops, out of everything
on the screen,

00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:29.320
has your least amount of sugar.

00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:31.492
So it's really
interesting that you'll

00:21:31.492 --> 00:21:33.450
be walking down the
supermarket and see someone

00:21:33.450 --> 00:21:35.580
who has Fruit
Loops in their cart

00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:37.230
and you have the Smart Start,
you're like, ooh, look at me.

00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:37.875
I'm so awesome.

00:21:37.875 --> 00:21:39.429
But not really.

00:21:39.429 --> 00:21:41.970
You have to really be careful
and look at the back of things,

00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:44.303
because just because they're
not marketed towards kids--

00:21:44.303 --> 00:21:46.609
and there's a cereal that
I used to eat all the time,

00:21:46.609 --> 00:21:48.650
and when we were doing
this, I looked at the back

00:21:48.650 --> 00:21:52.110
and I was shocked to see that
it had food dyes in it, that it

00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:53.750
had a lot of
artificial chemicals.

00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:55.137
And there it was.

00:21:55.137 --> 00:21:56.720
I thought it was
good because I looked

00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:57.890
at the nutritional
content, but I didn't

00:21:57.890 --> 00:21:59.110
look at the other ingredients.

00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:01.690
So it's really important to kind
of look at what you're taking,

00:22:01.690 --> 00:22:03.940
because just because they're
not geared towards kids--

00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:07.040
a lot of these companies
have been responsible

00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:09.150
and they kind of reacted
to the outrage of parents

00:22:09.150 --> 00:22:10.690
for what they were
giving their children.

00:22:10.690 --> 00:22:12.500
But because there wasn't
outrage of what they were giving

00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:14.690
themselves, they kind of
snuck some things in there,

00:22:14.690 --> 00:22:16.890
and they didn't really
react that way to it.

00:22:16.890 --> 00:22:18.562
So just be mindful
of what's there.

00:22:18.562 --> 00:22:20.270
Again, we're not saying
don't eat cereal,

00:22:20.270 --> 00:22:22.770
and if you love one of those
brands, keep eating it.

00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:24.940
Just be mindful how much
sugar, how many calories,

00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:26.290
or the other things
that you're eating

00:22:26.290 --> 00:22:27.830
throughout the rest of the
day, because it might not

00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:30.340
be the healthy start that
you think you're getting.

00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:30.610
ILYSE SCHAPIRO: Right.

00:22:30.610 --> 00:22:31.340
Right.

00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:34.270
Raisin Bran is full of
sugar-- full of sugar.

00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:37.250
OK, anyway, artificial
sweeteners, another one

00:22:37.250 --> 00:22:38.700
of my favorite topics.

00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:41.310
Who wants to admit that
they use something?

00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:45.230
Pink, yellow, blue,
Truvia, stevia?

00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:47.700
Nobody in here uses
artificial sweeteners?

00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:49.220
A handful-- a handful.

00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:52.520
Drinks diet soda?

00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:54.720
All righty.

00:22:54.720 --> 00:23:00.172
So I always tell people I
used to be a Diet Coke addict.

00:23:00.172 --> 00:23:01.880
I used to be a Diet
Coke addict, and then

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:03.130
when I decided to
have children, I

00:23:03.130 --> 00:23:05.296
cut it out because I just
didn't want it in my body.

00:23:05.296 --> 00:23:08.560
And not on purpose, but
I lost five pounds just

00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:11.920
from cutting out
artificial sweeteners.

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:15.720
So I know a lot of people
are kind of getting away

00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:18.530
from these colorful packets.

00:23:18.530 --> 00:23:21.150
They're still out there.

00:23:21.150 --> 00:23:22.370
My husband uses Splenda.

00:23:22.370 --> 00:23:23.830
So it just is what it is.

00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:25.610
But we're just here
to educate you.

00:23:25.610 --> 00:23:28.910
So Sweet and Low is 300
to 500 times sweeter

00:23:28.910 --> 00:23:30.230
than regular sugar.

00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:33.650
Equal is 200 times sweeter, and
Splenda is 600 times sweeter

00:23:33.650 --> 00:23:35.260
than regular sugar.

00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:38.510
Our point is actually intake
of artificial sweeteners

00:23:38.510 --> 00:23:41.070
can actually affect
your body's ability

00:23:41.070 --> 00:23:43.410
to regulate itself and
regulate its metabolism

00:23:43.410 --> 00:23:45.360
and regulate its weight.

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:48.070
Like I said, I cut it out when
I was trying to get pregnant

00:23:48.070 --> 00:23:50.370
and I lost five pounds.

00:23:50.370 --> 00:23:53.420
Then you actually, when
you have a lot of these,

00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:54.560
you crave more sweet.

00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:57.600
And then even sometimes
fruits and vegetables

00:23:57.600 --> 00:24:00.890
like strawberries, blueberries,
don't even taste sweet to you

00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:01.390
anymore.

00:24:01.390 --> 00:24:04.770
Or I have clients who put
Splenda in their Greek yogurt

00:24:04.770 --> 00:24:05.857
to make it taste better.

00:24:08.292 --> 00:24:09.750
And there are
numerous studies that

00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:12.040
have been published
recently that it actually is

00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:14.100
linked to an increase in BMI.

00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:17.300
And a lot of people say to
me, well, but I use Truvia,

00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:18.650
I have stevia.

00:24:18.650 --> 00:24:20.970
I tell people, if it's
powdered and in a packet,

00:24:20.970 --> 00:24:22.070
it's still processed.

00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:25.530
So if you need
something, either just do

00:24:25.530 --> 00:24:28.990
one teaspoon of regular
sugar, sugar in the raw,

00:24:28.990 --> 00:24:32.050
or the best kind of
noncalorie sweetener

00:24:32.050 --> 00:24:35.756
is stevia leaf extract,
which is a dropper.

00:24:35.756 --> 00:24:38.130
So you can buy that at like
a Whole Foods or Mrs. Green's

00:24:38.130 --> 00:24:41.125
or something like that.

00:24:41.125 --> 00:24:42.750
And then kind of
going along with this,

00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:43.790
where is sugar hidden?

00:24:43.790 --> 00:24:46.210
Now, I eat foods that
have sugar in them.

00:24:46.210 --> 00:24:49.612
I think it's unrealistic
to completely eliminate it.

00:24:49.612 --> 00:24:51.070
But I know a lot
of people are just

00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:53.250
trying to be more and
more conscious about it.

00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:56.830
So we're just kind of
here to empower you.

00:24:56.830 --> 00:24:59.520
And no longer do they just
list sugar on the label.

00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:01.920
They've gotten really
smart to hide it in places

00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:04.450
where we wouldn't know.

00:25:04.450 --> 00:25:06.870
So you want to always look
at the sugar content in terms

00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:09.290
of grams, and then you
want to read the label

00:25:09.290 --> 00:25:10.860
and look out for added sugars.

00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:14.320
Anything that ends in ose--
dextrose, fructose, lactose--

00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:18.800
anything that has a syrup or a
juice, corn syrup, cane juice.

00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:22.440
And even if it says organic
cane sugar is still sugar,

00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:25.820
agave is still
sugar-- maple syrup.

00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:28.910
And then less obvious
names-- dextrin honey,

00:25:28.910 --> 00:25:32.447
hydrogenated starch,
molasses, sorghum.

00:25:32.447 --> 00:25:34.030
And again, we're
just saying if you're

00:25:34.030 --> 00:25:36.370
somebody who's conscious about
your sugar intake for the day,

00:25:36.370 --> 00:25:38.161
this is just other ways
to look out for it,

00:25:38.161 --> 00:25:41.910
because it's no longer just
called sugar on the label.

00:25:41.910 --> 00:25:45.600
All right, so there are
plenty of foods out there

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:47.820
that get kind of
this health halo

00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:49.810
effect, which is a real term.

00:25:49.810 --> 00:25:52.910
What are the foods that we
think are healthy, but aren't?

00:25:52.910 --> 00:25:54.860
So the first one is dried fruit.

00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:57.770
And I think anybody in here
think dried fruit is healthy,

00:25:57.770 --> 00:26:01.280
or they like it or-- so
actually a bunch of you.

00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:02.423
A ton of you.

00:26:02.423 --> 00:26:05.479
The thing with dried fruit,
raisins or any other kind

00:26:05.479 --> 00:26:07.020
of dried fruit, is
that actually it's

00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:08.690
totally depleted in nutrients.

00:26:08.690 --> 00:26:09.607
And it's less filling.

00:26:09.607 --> 00:26:11.981
If you think about it, they've
taken the water out of it,

00:26:11.981 --> 00:26:13.550
so it's not going to be filling.

00:26:13.550 --> 00:26:16.290
And it's actually loaded
with calories and sugar.

00:26:16.290 --> 00:26:19.100
Even if it says no sugar added,
because there's no water in it,

00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:21.130
it's very concentrated.

00:26:21.130 --> 00:26:25.030
Same with veggie pasta
and veggie chips.

00:26:25.030 --> 00:26:27.820
I say a veggie chip is still
a chip, and veggie pasta,

00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:32.080
it basically just has
powdered spinach powder in it.

00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:35.569
You're much better off having
pasta, having whole wheat

00:26:35.569 --> 00:26:37.360
pasta, and pairing it
with real vegetables,

00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:38.970
and you'll get a
much better effect.

00:26:38.970 --> 00:26:40.970
And the veggie chips, again,
do they serve a purpose?

00:26:40.970 --> 00:26:42.469
Do I have them in
my house sometimes

00:26:42.469 --> 00:26:43.800
because I have two young kids?

00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:44.440
Absolutely.

00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:46.648
But you just have to know,
it's still kind of a chip.

00:26:46.648 --> 00:26:47.880
Yes, it has less fat.

00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:50.225
But obviously, you're better
off eating real vegetables.

00:26:50.225 --> 00:26:52.100
HALLIE RICH: Yeah, go
with the chip you want.

00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:53.400
ILYSE SCHAPIRO:
Right, right, exactly.

00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:53.490
HALLIE RICH: Because
the veggie chip

00:26:53.490 --> 00:26:55.441
is not necessarily healthier.

00:26:55.441 --> 00:26:58.220
Fruit juice is kind of deceiving
because it has tons of sugar.

00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:01.570
Just kind of giving another
analogy, Mott's apple juice

00:27:01.570 --> 00:27:04.160
has 28 grams of sugar
for an eight-ounce cup.

00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:07.020
Pepsi has the exact
same amount of sugar.

00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:08.650
So you might think
that you're drinking

00:27:08.650 --> 00:27:09.774
something that's healthier.

00:27:09.774 --> 00:27:12.252
Again, I'm not advocating
to drink soda necessarily,

00:27:12.252 --> 00:27:14.460
but just don't think you're
making the smarter choice

00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:15.876
necessarily by
having fruit juice,

00:27:15.876 --> 00:27:18.340
whether it's by itself, in your
alcohol, or whatever it is.

00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:21.470
Fruit juice can be very
deceivingly high in sugar.

00:27:21.470 --> 00:27:22.400
Same with trail mix.

00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:25.190
Even though it's delicious,
it's nuts, it's got a lot of fat

00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:25.690
in there.

00:27:25.690 --> 00:27:27.314
And a lot of times
with your trail mix,

00:27:27.314 --> 00:27:30.210
you're having little
crackers, there's chocolate,

00:27:30.210 --> 00:27:31.940
there's M&amp;Ms, which,
again, I love.

00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:33.440
ILYSE SCHAPIRO: And
the dried fruit.

00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:34.370
HALLIE RICH: Right, dried fruit.

00:27:34.370 --> 00:27:35.430
So you just have to be careful.

00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:37.096
With trail mix, the
most important thing

00:27:37.096 --> 00:27:37.892
is serving size.

00:27:37.892 --> 00:27:39.850
Don't go in there and
get a huge heaping of it.

00:27:39.850 --> 00:27:41.225
Just have a little
bit of a taste

00:27:41.225 --> 00:27:43.970
and enjoy it, and just
use it for what it is.

00:27:43.970 --> 00:27:45.470
And when it comes
to buzzwords, this

00:27:45.470 --> 00:27:47.110
is something that's
really interesting.

00:27:47.110 --> 00:27:48.670
Whether it's the
word natural, which

00:27:48.670 --> 00:27:52.370
has zero meaning when
it comes to the FDA

00:27:52.370 --> 00:27:55.962
and what they assign to have
natural, it has no definition.

00:27:55.962 --> 00:27:58.420
So what you think of natural
and what you think of natural,

00:27:58.420 --> 00:28:00.086
you're both right and
you're both wrong,

00:28:00.086 --> 00:28:01.900
because it doesn't
mean anything.

00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:03.420
So you might be picking
something up and thinking,

00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:04.460
oh, I'm getting
something better,

00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:05.960
whether it's because more
money, whether you think

00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:07.126
it's just a healthier thing.

00:28:07.126 --> 00:28:10.060
But don't fall into that trap.

00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:12.510
Same with the things like
skinny, smart, from the Earth.

00:28:12.510 --> 00:28:15.060
Any of those kinds of terms
are just marketing terms.

00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:17.012
I mean, you guys deal
with them all the time.

00:28:17.012 --> 00:28:18.470
They're just things
that they think

00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:20.136
will excite you and
get you to buy them.

00:28:20.136 --> 00:28:22.620
And they're normally right,
because people think, well,

00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:24.962
if they're saying that on
a box or a label or a can,

00:28:24.962 --> 00:28:27.291
it must mean something,
and it doesn't.

00:28:27.291 --> 00:28:29.290
So again, if you like it
and you want to buy it,

00:28:29.290 --> 00:28:31.260
do it, but don't think you're
getting some added benefit.

00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:33.300
You might be, but you
also might not be.

00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:36.000
It's 50-50,
depending upon what's

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.552
on the back of the label.

00:28:37.552 --> 00:28:39.260
Something else, like
honey wheat pretzels

00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:41.960
versus regular pretzels,
actually the regular pretzels

00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:45.280
have less sugar, less fat,
than the honey wheat pretzels.

00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:48.280
So it's very interesting that
if you just take two seconds,

00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:50.430
turn two things over,
you'll be able to see.

00:28:50.430 --> 00:28:51.920
And don't be afraid of
that nutrition label.

00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:54.169
It's all really laid out
there for you very carefully.

00:28:54.169 --> 00:28:57.456
And it's very easy
to compare things.

00:28:57.456 --> 00:28:59.594
So that's kind of the
deal with buzzwords.

00:28:59.594 --> 00:29:00.510
ILYSE SCHAPIRO: Right.

00:29:00.510 --> 00:29:02.260
As we were writing the
book, the two of us

00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:04.410
literally went to
the supermarket

00:29:04.410 --> 00:29:06.560
and looked at Baked
Lays versus Regular Lays

00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:08.335
and reduced fat versus this.

00:29:08.335 --> 00:29:10.460
HALLIE RICH: And sometimes
that makes a difference.

00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:13.480
There are cookies that go
from 10 grams of fat to five

00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:16.010
grams of fat, because reduced
fat has to be cut in half.

00:29:16.010 --> 00:29:17.884
But if it's two grams
to one gram, what

00:29:17.884 --> 00:29:18.800
are you getting there?

00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:19.580
You're getting more fillers.

00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:20.320
You're getting more binders.

00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:21.120
You're getting more chemicals.

00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:23.050
I mean, whether it's
fruit or it's cookies,

00:29:23.050 --> 00:29:25.290
when you take something out, you
have to put something back in.

00:29:25.290 --> 00:29:27.150
Otherwise it's not gonna
have the same substance.

00:29:27.150 --> 00:29:28.380
It's not going to taste
the same in your mouth.

00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:29.930
The mouth feel is
going to be different.

00:29:29.930 --> 00:29:31.330
So what are they
putting it back in for?

00:29:31.330 --> 00:29:32.871
And maybe that
doesn't matter to you.

00:29:32.871 --> 00:29:33.899
Maybe it does.

00:29:33.899 --> 00:29:35.190
And that's kind of what we say.

00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:37.130
We're not here to tell
you which one to have.

00:29:37.130 --> 00:29:39.739
Just make the right decision
on what your priorities are so

00:29:39.739 --> 00:29:41.280
that you can make
the right decisions

00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:43.720
for your lifestyle and
your health lifestyle

00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:44.720
and what matters to you.

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:45.761
ILYSE SCHAPIRO: OK, cool.

00:29:45.761 --> 00:29:47.990
All right, I'm going to give
the five minute warning,

00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:49.180
If anybody has
questions, you could

00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:50.690
start lining up
at the microphone

00:29:50.690 --> 00:29:53.427
as we kind of wrap up.

00:29:53.427 --> 00:29:55.010
HALLIE RICH: Jet lag
is just something

00:29:55.010 --> 00:29:57.270
when we talk to a lot
of corporate people,

00:29:57.270 --> 00:29:59.760
they seem to be very interested
in, because you're always

00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:02.260
traveling, whether it's for
you guys to the West Coast

00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:06.080
or different meetings
across the oceans.

00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:07.750
But how do you deal with it?

00:30:07.750 --> 00:30:11.220
And instead of feeling sluggish
and out of sorts and fatigued,

00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:13.070
so one thing would be melatonin.

00:30:13.070 --> 00:30:14.610
You want to start
a few days before.

00:30:14.610 --> 00:30:15.740
There's plenty of
foods where you

00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:17.536
can see, like oatmeal,
bananas, oranges,

00:30:17.536 --> 00:30:18.660
that you can get them from.

00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:20.076
They also come in
supplement form.

00:30:20.076 --> 00:30:23.400
Pycnogenol is something you
might not be as familiar with.

00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:26.010
It actually comes from
the bark of pine trees.

00:30:26.010 --> 00:30:29.690
There was a study that says
if you have 50 grams two days

00:30:29.690 --> 00:30:31.610
before and continuing
through five days

00:30:31.610 --> 00:30:34.980
after, it'll help not only
with some symptoms of jet lag,

00:30:34.980 --> 00:30:37.020
but also with your
immunity, which is always

00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:38.360
important because
when you're on a plane

00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:39.800
or you're in the airport
and everyone's sneezing

00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:41.620
and coughing around
you, and you're

00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:44.480
taking a trip with 100 people on
the plane and all their germs,

00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:47.650
something you kind of don't
want to take home with you.

00:30:47.650 --> 00:30:49.160
Same with the
vitamins B, C, and E.

00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:51.510
Those are really
important for helping

00:30:51.510 --> 00:30:52.867
to support your immunity.

00:30:52.867 --> 00:30:55.200
And again, you can get those
in chocolates, blueberries,

00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:56.222
grapes, oranges.

00:30:56.222 --> 00:30:57.930
If you're already
taking a multi-vitamin,

00:30:57.930 --> 00:30:59.888
it's something you're
getting in there already,

00:30:59.888 --> 00:31:01.272
so you may not need any extra.

00:31:01.272 --> 00:31:03.230
But it's really important
for both your jet lag

00:31:03.230 --> 00:31:04.146
and for your immunity.

00:31:04.146 --> 00:31:06.200
You don't want to be
feeling under the weather

00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:09.190
or out of sorts when you're
giving an important talk

00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:13.570
or listening to us, or just
on a vacation with friends

00:31:13.570 --> 00:31:14.070
and family.

00:31:14.070 --> 00:31:14.950
You want to enjoy yourself.

00:31:14.950 --> 00:31:16.699
You paid a lot for
that trip and you don't

00:31:16.699 --> 00:31:17.890
want to worry about jet lag.

00:31:17.890 --> 00:31:19.348
And also, just
drink tons of water.

00:31:19.348 --> 00:31:20.610
Try to avoid alcohol.

00:31:20.610 --> 00:31:22.125
Sleep when you
should be sleeping.

00:31:22.125 --> 00:31:24.070
Eat when you should
be eating, and that

00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:26.270
will help you with jet lag.

00:31:26.270 --> 00:31:28.944
ILYSE SCHAPIRO: All
right, vitawoman.

00:31:28.944 --> 00:31:30.360
HALLIE RICH: So
the question I get

00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:32.670
asked the most is, do I really
need to be taking any vitamins?

00:31:32.670 --> 00:31:33.474
I eat really well.

00:31:33.474 --> 00:31:35.890
And it seems like you guys do
eat pretty well, considering

00:31:35.890 --> 00:31:37.810
how you've answered some
of the questions so far.

00:31:37.810 --> 00:31:39.082
ILYSE SCHAPIRO: Plus
the cafeteria's awesome.

00:31:39.082 --> 00:31:40.207
HALLIE RICH: Yeah, exactly.

00:31:40.207 --> 00:31:40.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:42.720
But what's really interesting
is that food today

00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:43.940
isn't what food used to be.

00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:46.600
And there's a really interesting
statistic from the USDA

00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:49.480
that you would have to have
seven cups of spinach today

00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:51.140
to get the same
nutritional content you

00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:54.525
would have had to get from one
cup of spinach in the 1960s.

00:31:54.525 --> 00:31:56.650
And again, that's not us
saying don't have spinach.

00:31:56.650 --> 00:31:58.870
It's just saying
soil is overfarmed.

00:31:58.870 --> 00:31:59.690
It's depleted.

00:31:59.690 --> 00:32:00.510
There's chemicals.

00:32:00.510 --> 00:32:03.330
There's lots of different
things in the soil that

00:32:03.330 --> 00:32:05.420
just make even a
healthy food not as

00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:06.814
healthy as it used to be.

00:32:06.814 --> 00:32:08.730
And so you would really
need to overcompensate

00:32:08.730 --> 00:32:10.380
for what your
grandparents used to have

00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:12.110
and how they used to eat.

00:32:12.110 --> 00:32:15.160
Also, a lot of times food
used to be from farm to table.

00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:17.180
Now you're getting
fruits and vegetables

00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:18.150
from Central America.

00:32:18.150 --> 00:32:19.810
They pick them
before they're ripe.

00:32:19.810 --> 00:32:21.434
They sit on your
shelves, and it's just

00:32:21.434 --> 00:32:22.510
a different kind of food.

00:32:22.510 --> 00:32:23.850
So even if you're
eating really well,

00:32:23.850 --> 00:32:26.308
you're not necessarily getting
all the nutritional benefits

00:32:26.308 --> 00:32:28.492
that you would be, even
if you eat a perfect diet.

00:32:28.492 --> 00:32:30.700
Then we all know that we
all don't eat perfect diets.

00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:31.400
We're human.

00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:32.260
We're both human.

00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:35.330
You have different types
of foods during the day.

00:32:35.330 --> 00:32:37.010
Some days are better
than other days.

00:32:37.010 --> 00:32:39.780
And a vitamin really
is an insurance policy.

00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:41.390
And a vitamin is
part of a category

00:32:41.390 --> 00:32:43.666
of products called supplements.

00:32:43.666 --> 00:32:45.040
And really what
you want to do is

00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:48.832
you want to supplement your
diet with proper products.

00:32:48.832 --> 00:32:50.540
So you don't want to--
it's not a license

00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:51.310
to eat whatever you want.

00:32:51.310 --> 00:32:53.140
And anyone who tells you that,
if they're in my industry,

00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:54.370
they're embarrassing
my industry.

00:32:54.370 --> 00:32:55.286
That's not who we are.

00:32:55.286 --> 00:32:56.950
We're about adding
to what you're

00:32:56.950 --> 00:32:58.290
doing so that you're
getting the most out

00:32:58.290 --> 00:32:59.890
of everything, because
your body really

00:32:59.890 --> 00:33:02.056
needs the right vitamins,
minerals, and antioxidants

00:33:02.056 --> 00:33:03.070
to function properly.

00:33:03.070 --> 00:33:05.240
And you want to make sure you're
getting that, hopefully mostly

00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:07.470
from food, but whatever
you can't get from food--

00:33:07.470 --> 00:33:09.470
you have car insurance,
you have life insurance,

00:33:09.470 --> 00:33:10.860
you have health insurance.

00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:13.174
Think of vitamins as
your body's insurance.

00:33:13.174 --> 00:33:15.090
I would always say start
with a multi-vitamin.

00:33:15.090 --> 00:33:16.990
It's your great basic
foundation program.

00:33:16.990 --> 00:33:19.720
It has enough of your vitamins
and minerals in there.

00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:21.339
Something to be
mindful of, though,

00:33:21.339 --> 00:33:23.880
make sure your multi has both
vitamins and minerals in there.

00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:25.910
Are a lot of times they'll
call themselves a multi,

00:33:25.910 --> 00:33:27.080
but you won't see calcium.

00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:28.580
You won't see
magnesium in there.

00:33:28.580 --> 00:33:31.010
So just make sure that
you're getting both.

00:33:31.010 --> 00:33:32.770
If you want to add
other things on there,

00:33:32.770 --> 00:33:34.460
you can look at probiotics.

00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:37.200
You can look at omegas,
things with CoQ10.

00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:39.359
But those are just the
kind of different things

00:33:39.359 --> 00:33:40.400
that you can add onto it.

00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:42.417
But I would always
start with a multi.

00:33:42.417 --> 00:33:44.000
And even though it's
summer, one thing

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:45.880
I know Ilyse stresses
a lot is vitamin D.

00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:48.840
Make sure it has a good
amount of vitamin D in there.

00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:50.770
Vitamin D is actually a hormone.

00:33:50.770 --> 00:33:53.587
And whether it's the sun
that you need to produce it,

00:33:53.587 --> 00:33:54.920
it's very hard to get from food.

00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:57.821
So we say it's
trendy for a reason.

00:33:57.821 --> 00:33:59.820
Vitamin D is actually a
very important nutrient.

00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:00.736
ILYSE SCHAPIRO: Right.

00:34:00.736 --> 00:34:03.250
And 77% of Americans
are vitamin D deficient.

00:34:03.250 --> 00:34:05.960
So it's really important
to get your levels checked

00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:06.860
from your doctor.

00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:09.004
But it can't hurt to
have at least 1,000 IUs

00:34:09.004 --> 00:34:09.920
of vitamin D in your--

00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:10.440
HALLIE RICH: Right.

00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:13.000
I mean, a lot of things, for
women especially, calcium,

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:14.583
but you would be
surprised, if you all

00:34:14.583 --> 00:34:17.489
Google it, to see what
you're deficient in.

00:34:17.489 --> 00:34:19.618
There are so many--
the majority of people,

00:34:19.618 --> 00:34:21.159
even though they
think they eat well,

00:34:21.159 --> 00:34:24.080
are actually deficient
in many nutrients.

00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:26.665
So it's kind of an
interesting statistic.

00:34:26.665 --> 00:34:27.540
ILYSE SCHAPIRO: Yeah.

00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:28.300
OK, cool.

00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:29.260
So wrapping up.

00:34:29.260 --> 00:34:32.420
So steps for optimal success.

00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:33.639
Don't skip meals.

00:34:33.639 --> 00:34:34.723
This is huge.

00:34:34.723 --> 00:34:36.139
Plan ahead if you
have a busy day.

00:34:36.139 --> 00:34:37.830
But it's always important.

00:34:37.830 --> 00:34:40.480
I just got interviewed-- should
I eat breakfast every day?

00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:42.194
I'm a huge believer
in starting your day

00:34:42.194 --> 00:34:43.860
with a healthy breakfast
and then eating

00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:45.070
every three to four hours.

00:34:45.070 --> 00:34:45.639
I get it.

00:34:45.639 --> 00:34:46.480
I'm a working mom.

00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:47.006
I'm busy.

00:34:47.006 --> 00:34:48.880
I grab something as I'm
running out the door.

00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:50.139
I kind of pack my
lunch for the day,

00:34:50.139 --> 00:34:51.590
because I don't want to
be stuck without food.

00:34:51.590 --> 00:34:53.610
Luckily, you guys, again,
have a great cafeteria

00:34:53.610 --> 00:34:54.940
where it's at your fingertips.

00:34:54.940 --> 00:34:56.690
But if you're out and
about and traveling,

00:34:56.690 --> 00:34:58.720
it's really important
to plan ahead.

00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:01.010
You want to fuel your body
with high-quality food

00:35:01.010 --> 00:35:02.030
as best you can.

00:35:02.030 --> 00:35:04.660
Eat every three to
four to five hours.

00:35:04.660 --> 00:35:06.470
Stay hydrated-- huge.

00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:09.330
As you can see I've been
drinking this water as we go.

00:35:09.330 --> 00:35:11.040
Plan ahead if you
have a busy day.

00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:13.380
Aim for seven to eight
hours of sleep per night.

00:35:13.380 --> 00:35:15.080
I think people
also underestimate

00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:16.710
the power of sleep.

00:35:16.710 --> 00:35:19.650
A big thing, maybe you guys
know, maybe you don't, they

00:35:19.650 --> 00:35:22.260
even say turn off your devices
at least a half hour before

00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:25.980
you go to bed, because that
light is very stimulating.

00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:28.990
I even throw a T-shirt
on my cable box,

00:35:28.990 --> 00:35:30.800
because even the light
from the cable box

00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:32.300
is too stimulating for me.

00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:34.380
But seven to eight
hours per night-- A,

00:35:34.380 --> 00:35:37.180
obviously you function
better the next day.

00:35:37.180 --> 00:35:40.144
But it also affects your
weight, how much sleep,

00:35:40.144 --> 00:35:41.560
because if you
don't sleep enough,

00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:44.140
it increases cortisol levels
in the body and kind of just

00:35:44.140 --> 00:35:46.390
holds on to that weight
you're trying to lose.

00:35:46.390 --> 00:35:47.640
Be active.

00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:49.580
If you're not a gym
person, that's OK.

00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:51.710
Aim for 10,000 steps
per day, whether you

00:35:51.710 --> 00:35:53.700
have a Fitbit or
certain phones actually

00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:55.400
track your steps,
which is awesome.

00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:59.430
Check in with your step counter
daily and aim for 10,000 steps.

00:35:59.430 --> 00:36:02.660
Don't ignore the power of
proper supplementation.

00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:04.440
We say everything
in moderation, which

00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:07.070
is what we totally
preach in our book

00:36:07.070 --> 00:36:08.530
and what I preach
in my practice.

00:36:08.530 --> 00:36:11.312
And honor and respect your body.

00:36:11.312 --> 00:36:14.160
So thank you, and
you can follow us

00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:17.565
on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram.

00:36:17.565 --> 00:36:19.584
And we'll start
taking questions.

00:36:19.584 --> 00:36:21.000
And maybe as people
ask questions,

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.357
more questions will
kind of come up.

00:36:23.357 --> 00:36:23.898
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:36:23.898 --> 00:36:25.856
I have a comment and a question.

00:36:25.856 --> 00:36:28.230
The comment, I was not going
to make it in the beginning,

00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:33.090
but you mentioned, buzzwords,
and I cannot hold myself.

00:36:33.090 --> 00:36:36.160
You talk about chemicals,
like chemicals are everything.

00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:39.900
The salt that you add, even
it's just pure chemical.

00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:43.462
I believe that you should use
the word like industrially

00:36:43.462 --> 00:36:46.316
synthesized as opposed
to naturally synthesized

00:36:46.316 --> 00:36:48.994
chemicals, because every
time, some people, it's like,

00:36:48.994 --> 00:36:50.160
oh, you add chemicals to it.

00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:51.110
It's like, yeah.

00:36:51.110 --> 00:36:54.770
Anything that I add, even just
pure water, is a chemical.

00:36:54.770 --> 00:36:58.100
So we should also try
to avoid that buzzword

00:36:58.100 --> 00:37:02.050
that is against the standard
process of preparing

00:37:02.050 --> 00:37:04.410
your food, which is you're
just combining chemicals

00:37:04.410 --> 00:37:05.350
to prepare something.

00:37:05.350 --> 00:37:07.290
So that was the comment.

00:37:07.290 --> 00:37:12.140
And then the question is,
let me know if I'm incorrect,

00:37:12.140 --> 00:37:13.430
if I'm not right.

00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:15.050
You said in the
beginning that you

00:37:15.050 --> 00:37:17.700
made the book in order for
us to make better decisions.

00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:18.533
ILYSE SCHAPIRO: Yes.

00:37:18.533 --> 00:37:19.930
AUDIENCE: So two questions then.

00:37:19.930 --> 00:37:24.260
What is your opinion and what
he's the things that we should

00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:26.510
do against, like, for example,
the sugar industry that

00:37:26.510 --> 00:37:31.400
is trying to hide the
addition of sugars into milk?

00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:34.070
How can we make decisions if
we don't have the information

00:37:34.070 --> 00:37:35.500
to make those decisions?

00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:39.620
And also, the humans are
essentially bad decision

00:37:39.620 --> 00:37:40.930
makers.

00:37:40.930 --> 00:37:46.930
So what is your stand
like imposing some kind

00:37:46.930 --> 00:37:51.509
of regulatory better decision
making process so that people

00:37:51.509 --> 00:37:53.550
cannot make bad decisions
because they don't have

00:37:53.550 --> 00:37:55.220
the possibility to
make bad decisions?

00:37:55.220 --> 00:37:57.650
And I'm talking
about, for example,

00:37:57.650 --> 00:38:00.170
reducing the amount
of sugars that

00:38:00.170 --> 00:38:03.120
can be sold in schools
or food programs

00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:08.962
for children, like the fact
that they can buy a bag of chips

00:38:08.962 --> 00:38:12.320
more than a plate of spinach.

00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:14.169
ILYSE SCHAPIRO: Right.

00:38:14.169 --> 00:38:16.710
HALLIE RICH: I think it's a lot
bigger conversation than just

00:38:16.710 --> 00:38:17.209
us.

00:38:17.209 --> 00:38:19.380
I mean, for example,
cheap food is more

00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:21.770
affordable than healthier food.

00:38:21.770 --> 00:38:23.190
So if you're
talking about people

00:38:23.190 --> 00:38:25.240
who are on limited
incomes, limited budgets,

00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:28.920
they may not have, even though
we may say buy organic this

00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:31.250
or stay away from
chemicals or diet soda,

00:38:31.250 --> 00:38:33.875
if that's on sale
at the store for $1

00:38:33.875 --> 00:38:35.250
and everything
else is four times

00:38:35.250 --> 00:38:37.290
that, people have
budgetary limits of things

00:38:37.290 --> 00:38:38.250
that they can do.

00:38:38.250 --> 00:38:40.810
So until you kind of start
going from a government level

00:38:40.810 --> 00:38:43.206
that healthier things
become more affordable,

00:38:43.206 --> 00:38:45.080
it's going to be hard
to really dictate that,

00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:49.750
because many people then really
go into food deserts and things

00:38:49.750 --> 00:38:51.410
like that would be
a lot harder to do.

00:38:51.410 --> 00:38:53.160
I agree with you about
the chemical thing.

00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:55.090
I think a lot of
things get-- and maybe

00:38:55.090 --> 00:38:57.131
that is something we need
to be a little bit more

00:38:57.131 --> 00:38:59.012
mindful of, about chemicals.

00:38:59.012 --> 00:39:01.220
A lot of times, even in my
industry, they'll be like,

00:39:01.220 --> 00:39:02.950
well, is this organic vitamins?

00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:04.770
Well, not everything
organic is good.

00:39:04.770 --> 00:39:07.150
Not everything
organic is better.

00:39:07.150 --> 00:39:08.567
So I think it is
something that we

00:39:08.567 --> 00:39:10.650
do have to be mindful of
in the terms that we use.

00:39:10.650 --> 00:39:12.770
But in terms of people
making decisions and things

00:39:12.770 --> 00:39:15.490
with sugar, unless
companies are not

00:39:15.490 --> 00:39:18.600
abiding by the laws in which
they're regulated by already,

00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:20.810
all the sugars, even if
they're trying to hide things

00:39:20.810 --> 00:39:22.630
in sugars, and hopefully
we've given you some terms

00:39:22.630 --> 00:39:24.440
to look at now and
the other ingredients,

00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:26.210
but it all has to
be listed on there.

00:39:26.210 --> 00:39:28.520
If not, the company is
doing something illegal.

00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:29.750
And yes, there are
people who do that,

00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:30.770
but I'm sure in every industry.

00:39:30.770 --> 00:39:33.035
I'm sure you guys have
competitors in whatever space

00:39:33.035 --> 00:39:35.410
you guys are in within this
company that there are people

00:39:35.410 --> 00:39:36.940
who play by the rules and
there are people who don't.

00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:38.480
There's people who skirt the
rules and there are people who

00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:39.390
don't.

00:39:39.390 --> 00:39:43.170
But I do think
that, unfortunately,

00:39:43.170 --> 00:39:46.120
regulating what people can eat
and making healthier decisions

00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:48.735
is not just as easy
as that, because

00:39:48.735 --> 00:39:51.539
of just the cost of what
that would mean to people

00:39:51.539 --> 00:39:53.580
and how they live and how
they budget their lives

00:39:53.580 --> 00:39:54.700
and the salaries that they make.

00:39:54.700 --> 00:39:57.137
And not everyone can afford
with the way that things are.

00:39:57.137 --> 00:39:58.470
I mean, you're subsidizing corn.

00:39:58.470 --> 00:39:59.928
You're subsidizing
all these things

00:39:59.928 --> 00:40:02.830
that make chips a lot more
cheaper and affordable

00:40:02.830 --> 00:40:06.220
than it does your organic
celery or whatever it is.

00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:09.340
It's just not affordable
to a lot of people,

00:40:09.340 --> 00:40:11.900
I don't think it's as cut
and dry as just enforcing

00:40:11.900 --> 00:40:12.984
those decisions on people.

00:40:12.984 --> 00:40:13.900
ILYSE SCHAPIRO: Right.

00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:14.670
I think it's hard.

00:40:14.670 --> 00:40:16.750
They're changing the food label.

00:40:16.750 --> 00:40:18.850
I can't remember when it
comes out, but they are--

00:40:18.850 --> 00:40:19.550
HALLIE RICH: In two years.

00:40:19.550 --> 00:40:21.008
ILYSE SCHAPIRO:
Right-- changing it

00:40:21.008 --> 00:40:23.340
to show where added sugars
are, versus just giving you

00:40:23.340 --> 00:40:25.342
the basic sugar grams.

00:40:25.342 --> 00:40:27.050
I think they have to
include added sugars

00:40:27.050 --> 00:40:27.800
and stuff like that.

00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:28.040
HALLIE RICH: Right.

00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:29.581
ILYSE SCHAPIRO: But
I think it also--

00:40:29.581 --> 00:40:33.120
I speak at a lot of
schools, and sometimes I'm

00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:36.020
appalled that they still have
white bread to these kids.

00:40:36.020 --> 00:40:37.880
These kids, or my day
camp where my kids go,

00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:40.280
two years ago they finally
stopped serving white bread

00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:43.370
and they only gave whole
wheat bread as an option.

00:40:43.370 --> 00:40:45.310
So I think it kind
of starts smaller

00:40:45.310 --> 00:40:48.280
at schools and companies.

00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:49.600
But I don't know.

00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:51.310
I can't even speak
about government.

00:40:51.310 --> 00:40:54.320
But I think it gets really
tricky on a bigger level.

00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:56.190
So I think just
at smaller levels

00:40:56.190 --> 00:40:58.610
within your community,
that's where it kind of has

00:40:58.610 --> 00:41:02.713
to start for change.

00:41:02.713 --> 00:41:03.546
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:41:03.546 --> 00:41:04.421
ILYSE SCHAPIRO: Sure.

00:41:04.421 --> 00:41:05.089
Thank you.

00:41:05.089 --> 00:41:06.255
You want to go, [INAUDIBLE]?

00:41:06.255 --> 00:41:06.530
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:41:06.530 --> 00:41:07.566
Thanks so much for coming.

00:41:07.566 --> 00:41:08.458
Can you guys hear me?

00:41:08.458 --> 00:41:09.350
I'm so short.

00:41:09.350 --> 00:41:10.584
Thanks so much for coming.

00:41:10.584 --> 00:41:12.250
A lot of great
information here, and I'm

00:41:12.250 --> 00:41:14.342
excited to read the book.

00:41:14.342 --> 00:41:17.940
Two foods that I always get
conflicting information on

00:41:17.940 --> 00:41:21.320
are avocado and bananas.

00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:24.100
So I'd love to know
a little bit more

00:41:24.100 --> 00:41:26.440
about those from a health
side and whether or not

00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:29.390
we should even be avoiding them,
or just a little more on those.

00:41:29.390 --> 00:41:31.500
ILYSE SCHAPIRO: That's
a great question.

00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:33.840
Avocados are awesome for you.

00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:36.960
So even though avocados
have a lot of calories

00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:39.380
and have a lot of fat,
avocados are the good fat,

00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:41.940
which I'm sure you've also
heard about, with nuts and nut

00:41:41.940 --> 00:41:42.620
butters.

00:41:42.620 --> 00:41:45.685
Avocados are full with
mono unsaturated fats.

00:41:45.685 --> 00:41:46.810
Those are the healthy fats.

00:41:46.810 --> 00:41:49.760
That's what protects your heart
and kind of prevents heart

00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:51.510
disease.

00:41:51.510 --> 00:41:53.630
So I wouldn't eat a
whole avocado a day.

00:41:53.630 --> 00:41:56.460
But anywhere between a quarter
to half of an avocado per day

00:41:56.460 --> 00:41:58.810
if you're watching your
weight is fair game.

00:41:58.810 --> 00:42:00.539
Also because it does
have that good fat,

00:42:00.539 --> 00:42:02.080
it's going to keep
you more satisfied

00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:04.830
and it's going to keep you full
and prevent overeating, prevent

00:42:04.830 --> 00:42:07.480
that, oh, I need
chips with my lunch,

00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:09.800
where maybe you just had
a sandwich with turkey

00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:12.380
and avocado, and then
you'll feel more satisfied.

00:42:12.380 --> 00:42:15.852
Bananas get a bad rap.

00:42:15.852 --> 00:42:18.534
Are you talking about from
like a sugar standpoint?

00:42:18.534 --> 00:42:20.200
AUDIENCE: Just an
everything standpoint.

00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:22.100
ILYSE SCHAPIRO: So I
would say if somebody

00:42:22.100 --> 00:42:25.200
is athletic and works out
a lot, bananas are great.

00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:26.930
They're filled with potassium.

00:42:26.930 --> 00:42:29.341
I think they're a great
pre-workout snack, either alone

00:42:29.341 --> 00:42:30.840
or with some almond
butter or peanut

00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:32.350
butter, something like that.

00:42:32.350 --> 00:42:35.820
They are slightly more sugar
than some other fruits,

00:42:35.820 --> 00:42:37.500
than like an apple or berries.

00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:39.590
But bananas can be great
because they're portable.

00:42:39.590 --> 00:42:41.450
And again, if
you're somebody who

00:42:41.450 --> 00:42:42.990
exercises a couple
times per week,

00:42:42.990 --> 00:42:44.698
you shouldn't have a
problem, as long you

00:42:44.698 --> 00:42:46.280
stick to one banana per day.

00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:47.850
HALLIE RICH: And it's also,
what are you comparing it to?

00:42:47.850 --> 00:42:49.266
Is it a banana and
a bag of chips?

00:42:49.266 --> 00:42:50.740
Is it a banana and nothing?

00:42:50.740 --> 00:42:52.750
So I think you have
to, again, look

00:42:52.750 --> 00:42:54.220
at the entirety of the picture.

00:42:54.220 --> 00:42:56.095
You can't just look at
something in isolation

00:42:56.095 --> 00:42:58.140
and say, oh, bananas are
bad, because if you're

00:42:58.140 --> 00:43:01.117
talking about a banana versus
a Dunkin' Donut or something--

00:43:01.117 --> 00:43:02.700
again, it was just
National Donut Day,

00:43:02.700 --> 00:43:04.180
and we all had to avoid them.

00:43:04.180 --> 00:43:07.355
But you have to kind of, really,
what are you comparing it to,

00:43:07.355 --> 00:43:09.230
because even though it
might have more sugar,

00:43:09.230 --> 00:43:10.790
it's probably better than
nine of the other things

00:43:10.790 --> 00:43:11.480
you're going to pick.

00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:11.960
ILYSE SCHAPIRO: Right.

00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:13.501
HALLIE RICH: So you
just have to look

00:43:13.501 --> 00:43:16.400
at it in the entirety
of your day or your week

00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:19.402
and not just at that one
solitary defining moment.

00:43:19.402 --> 00:43:21.110
ILYSE SCHAPIRO: But
I would say if you're

00:43:21.110 --> 00:43:24.457
looking for one of the best
fruits, blueberries are great.

00:43:24.457 --> 00:43:25.540
They're filled with fiber.

00:43:25.540 --> 00:43:26.280
They're filling.

00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:27.820
They're filled
with antioxidants.

00:43:27.820 --> 00:43:33.260
But they're not exactly the
easiest, most portable snack.

00:43:33.260 --> 00:43:35.750
Bananas are great because you
can grab it on the go or--

00:43:35.750 --> 00:43:36.400
HALLIE RICH: Throw
it in your purse.

00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:38.530
ILYSE SCHAPIRO: Throw it in
your purse, something like that.

00:43:38.530 --> 00:43:40.380
So again, if you
exercise or work out,

00:43:40.380 --> 00:43:44.042
I say go for it, because
it's got the potassium.

00:43:44.042 --> 00:43:45.500
And they even say,
this is actually

00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:47.990
interesting about
bananas, I'm going

00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:51.000
to misspeak-- the
riper it is, where

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:54.241
it's more green than not--
is that ripe or unripe?

00:43:54.241 --> 00:43:54.740
Unripe.

00:43:54.740 --> 00:43:58.620
The more unripe it is, actually
it has resistant starch,

00:43:58.620 --> 00:44:00.920
so it's less likely to
affect your blood sugar.

00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:03.390
So actually, if you're watching
your weight or concerned,

00:44:03.390 --> 00:44:05.620
you're better off
buying it more green,

00:44:05.620 --> 00:44:07.720
because your body is less
affected by the starch

00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:11.809
and sugar in the body, which is
something I learned recently.

00:44:11.809 --> 00:44:13.100
AUDIENCE: Thank you for coming.

00:44:13.100 --> 00:44:16.278
Great news about
the avocados for me.

00:44:16.278 --> 00:44:19.857
In the slides it said stick with
low fat, referring to dairy,

00:44:19.857 --> 00:44:21.940
and I was wondering if you
guys could comment more

00:44:21.940 --> 00:44:26.677
on whole fat versus nonfat
versus halfway in between,

00:44:26.677 --> 00:44:28.510
'cause you said when
you take something out,

00:44:28.510 --> 00:44:29.320
you have to put it back in.

00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:31.194
So I was wondering if
there's a rule of thumb

00:44:31.194 --> 00:44:33.105
or if it varies by
product, things like that.

00:44:33.105 --> 00:44:34.350
ILYSE SCHAPIRO: I got this.

00:44:34.350 --> 00:44:36.990
So I get this
question all the time.

00:44:36.990 --> 00:44:40.770
I'm a big believer
in, not whole milk,

00:44:40.770 --> 00:44:44.150
but not skim, the low fat
in the middle, the 2%.

00:44:44.150 --> 00:44:49.810
In terms of products,
like reduced-fat cookies,

00:44:49.810 --> 00:44:51.582
yes, they end up
adding sugar and stuff

00:44:51.582 --> 00:44:52.790
like that to replace the fat.

00:44:52.790 --> 00:44:54.940
But in terms of dairy, or
if you like Greek yogurt,

00:44:54.940 --> 00:44:56.325
get the 2% Greek yogurt.

00:44:56.325 --> 00:44:58.950
It's going to feel more filling,
and there's not that many more

00:44:58.950 --> 00:45:00.201
calories to it.

00:45:00.201 --> 00:45:02.450
But again, I don't think you
have to go the whole milk

00:45:02.450 --> 00:45:04.560
route, because whole milk
does have saturated fat,

00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:05.990
which does clog your arteries.

00:45:05.990 --> 00:45:11.360
So I would go the middle of the
road, 2% for dairy-- cheese,

00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:12.772
yogurt, milk, that
type of thing.

00:45:12.772 --> 00:45:14.230
But again, if you
go out for dinner

00:45:14.230 --> 00:45:16.479
and you have fresh mozzarella
cheese, I say go for it.

00:45:16.479 --> 00:45:18.190
It's delicious.

00:45:18.190 --> 00:45:21.200
But milk, yogurt, on
a day-to-day basis,

00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:22.950
get the 2% middle of the road.

00:45:22.950 --> 00:45:24.366
So that's what we
mean by low fat.

00:45:24.366 --> 00:45:25.430
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:45:25.430 --> 00:45:26.110
HALLIE RICH: Just
with the cheese,

00:45:26.110 --> 00:45:27.860
we have a question in our
book where we talk exclusively

00:45:27.860 --> 00:45:30.300
about cheeses, and we say the
full-fat cheese is actually

00:45:30.300 --> 00:45:31.460
going to keep you
more satisfied.

00:45:31.460 --> 00:45:32.530
It tastes a lot better.

00:45:32.530 --> 00:45:33.905
So just have a
little bit of that

00:45:33.905 --> 00:45:37.012
instead of having all
of this no-fat cheese.

00:45:37.012 --> 00:45:38.720
First of all, I don't
know if you've ever

00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:40.330
tried making like a grilled
cheese sandwich or an omelette

00:45:40.330 --> 00:45:41.395
with the no-fat cheese.

00:45:41.395 --> 00:45:42.350
It just kind of sits there.

00:45:42.350 --> 00:45:42.730
ILYSE SCHAPIRO:
It's like plastic.

00:45:42.730 --> 00:45:43.340
HALLIE RICH: It doesn't
even do anything.

00:45:43.340 --> 00:45:44.340
ILYSE SCHAPIRO: Right.

00:45:44.340 --> 00:45:47.637
HALLIE RICH: So just go with
what you like a lot of times,

00:45:47.637 --> 00:45:49.595
especially with cheeses,
the whole fat variety.

00:45:49.595 --> 00:45:52.145
It's going to taste better and
you're going to enjoy it more,

00:45:52.145 --> 00:45:52.990
and you're not
going to be looking

00:45:52.990 --> 00:45:54.073
for a lot of other things.

00:45:54.073 --> 00:45:56.540
And you'll probably net out
with less calories and less fat

00:45:56.540 --> 00:45:59.890
than by eating way more
of the fat-free variety,

00:45:59.890 --> 00:46:03.790
or-- obviously the reduced fat
or 2% was a great option too.

00:46:03.790 --> 00:46:05.540
But if that's not
available for you.

00:46:05.540 --> 00:46:07.535
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:46:07.535 --> 00:46:08.160
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:09.880
I had two questions.

00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:17.250
The first is, why is there so
much competing points of view

00:46:17.250 --> 00:46:18.330
on nutrition?

00:46:18.330 --> 00:46:21.340
Why is your book the right
way versus other ways?

00:46:21.340 --> 00:46:22.562
Why does all this exist?

00:46:22.562 --> 00:46:26.110
And the second question is, have
you all evaluated the Google

00:46:26.110 --> 00:46:27.640
Microkitchens for good snacks?

00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:28.360
ILYSE SCHAPIRO: The what?

00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:28.910
Can you say that?

00:46:28.910 --> 00:46:29.700
I just couldn't hear you.

00:46:29.700 --> 00:46:31.158
AUDIENCE: The Google
Microkitchens,

00:46:31.158 --> 00:46:33.220
which are little
snack rooms that we

00:46:33.220 --> 00:46:34.410
have here for good snacks.

00:46:34.410 --> 00:46:36.160
HALLIE RICH: We haven't, but
we'll gladly do that later.

00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:37.576
ILYSE SCHAPIRO:
We looked briefly.

00:46:37.576 --> 00:46:40.724
We didn't have that much
time right before, but after.

00:46:40.724 --> 00:46:42.390
HALLIE RICH: I think
what's interesting,

00:46:42.390 --> 00:46:45.060
and I don't even know if Ilyse
agrees with me, about nutrition

00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:46.810
and about the health
and wellness category

00:46:46.810 --> 00:46:49.670
as a whole is that
there's a lot of competing

00:46:49.670 --> 00:46:50.670
interests out there.

00:46:50.670 --> 00:46:52.520
And I always say, you
have food on one side

00:46:52.520 --> 00:46:54.570
who want to believe you can get
everything you need from food.

00:46:54.570 --> 00:46:56.230
And then you have the
pharmaceutical industry

00:46:56.230 --> 00:46:57.120
who wants to believe
that everything

00:46:57.120 --> 00:46:58.350
can be cured by medicine.

00:46:58.350 --> 00:47:00.683
And then you have this like
health and wellness movement

00:47:00.683 --> 00:47:02.670
in the middle who want
you to eat well and want

00:47:02.670 --> 00:47:03.820
you to go to the doctor
when you don't feel well,

00:47:03.820 --> 00:47:06.020
but there's other,
more proactive ways

00:47:06.020 --> 00:47:07.610
of looking at your health.

00:47:07.610 --> 00:47:10.180
And I think a lot of times,
what's interesting with studies

00:47:10.180 --> 00:47:12.010
is, who funded them?

00:47:12.010 --> 00:47:13.470
Why do they exist?

00:47:13.470 --> 00:47:15.875
What is the point behind them?

00:47:15.875 --> 00:47:17.750
And a lot of times,
let's say in my industry,

00:47:17.750 --> 00:47:20.387
they'll say vitamins
don't cure cancer.

00:47:20.387 --> 00:47:21.720
Tell me something I didn't know.

00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:22.280
They shouldn't.

00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:23.100
They're not supposed to.

00:47:23.100 --> 00:47:24.020
Nothing cures cancer.

00:47:24.020 --> 00:47:25.450
Chemo doesn't cure cancer.

00:47:25.450 --> 00:47:27.200
So I think it's really
interesting to say,

00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:28.866
are you trying to
prove something that's

00:47:28.866 --> 00:47:30.220
a falsehood to begin with?

00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:31.840
What's your motive behind it?

00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:34.070
And I think a lot of
times also, are there

00:47:34.070 --> 00:47:35.440
double-blind placebo studies?

00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:37.690
Are they just looking at a
small percentage of people?

00:47:37.690 --> 00:47:38.600
Is it over years?

00:47:38.600 --> 00:47:40.880
What information did they
leave out of the study?

00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:42.430
A lot of the most
interesting parts

00:47:42.430 --> 00:47:44.263
of studies if you're
looking at the research

00:47:44.263 --> 00:47:46.430
is what they didn't include,
what they threw away.

00:47:46.430 --> 00:47:48.304
Was that because it
didn't prove their point?

00:47:48.304 --> 00:47:51.720
Was that because
it wasn't relevant?

00:47:51.720 --> 00:47:52.720
Who were their subjects?

00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:54.350
Are they people who were
unhealthy to begin with?

00:47:54.350 --> 00:47:56.160
Are they just a random
group of people?

00:47:56.160 --> 00:47:59.397
A lot of these things
are so-- unfortunately,

00:47:59.397 --> 00:48:01.230
a lot of times when the
news reports things,

00:48:01.230 --> 00:48:02.609
they just give
you the headlines.

00:48:02.609 --> 00:48:04.900
But if you just read three
sentences into the abstract,

00:48:04.900 --> 00:48:06.810
you'd get a totally
different view of what

00:48:06.810 --> 00:48:07.930
the study was presenting.

00:48:07.930 --> 00:48:10.630
And I think that's unfortunately
why there's so much

00:48:10.630 --> 00:48:13.300
mixed messaging out
there, because it's

00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:17.690
who read through the study
and who just read the headline

00:48:17.690 --> 00:48:19.970
and trying to take
it away from that.

00:48:19.970 --> 00:48:22.824
And I think that again, because
food has particular interests,

00:48:22.824 --> 00:48:24.490
pharmaceutical has
particular interests,

00:48:24.490 --> 00:48:26.107
and they're all good.

00:48:26.107 --> 00:48:27.940
We all love our drugs
when they make us feel

00:48:27.940 --> 00:48:28.860
better when we don't feel well.

00:48:28.860 --> 00:48:31.411
We all love our good food, and
we all love our bad food, too.

00:48:31.411 --> 00:48:33.410
We're not here to disparage
any of those people.

00:48:33.410 --> 00:48:36.530
But a lot of times a lot
of these big companies

00:48:36.530 --> 00:48:38.740
fund these studies
and they're trying

00:48:38.740 --> 00:48:41.670
to support something that
moves their bottom line

00:48:41.670 --> 00:48:42.720
and moves their product.

00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:45.500
And I think that unfortunately,
that's not always reported.

00:48:45.500 --> 00:48:47.916
And I think that's why there's
so much competing interest.

00:48:47.916 --> 00:48:50.260
And I think the reason that
our book has done so well

00:48:50.260 --> 00:48:51.950
and why we've gotten so
much positive feedback is

00:48:51.950 --> 00:48:53.420
because we're not
here telling you,

00:48:53.420 --> 00:48:55.230
eliminate this
whole class of food.

00:48:55.230 --> 00:48:56.170
Don't do something.

00:48:56.170 --> 00:48:56.877
We're all human.

00:48:56.877 --> 00:48:57.960
We all want to enjoy life.

00:48:57.960 --> 00:48:59.090
We all want to eat,
and we want to eat

00:48:59.090 --> 00:49:00.382
the things we like to eat.

00:49:00.382 --> 00:49:02.590
We're not here to kind of
dictate to you how you live

00:49:02.590 --> 00:49:05.362
and how you eat and what
you put into your body.

00:49:05.362 --> 00:49:07.320
The point is, how do you
make smarter decisions

00:49:07.320 --> 00:49:09.290
and get rid of a
lot of that bias

00:49:09.290 --> 00:49:11.850
against certain foods,
bananas for example.

00:49:14.870 --> 00:49:16.360
Again, it's what
is it compared to?

00:49:16.360 --> 00:49:18.350
We kind of want to put things
into perspective for you

00:49:18.350 --> 00:49:20.240
and make it part of
a larger discussion,

00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:22.380
as opposed to just isolating
things, because when

00:49:22.380 --> 00:49:25.190
you isolate anything, it could
be good, bad, or indifferent.

00:49:25.190 --> 00:49:28.600
It's just a matter of
it's not how you live.

00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:32.040
So I think that's how our
book kind of goes at that.

00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:32.786
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:49:32.786 --> 00:49:35.440
It'd be cool if you all
could look at the snacks

00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:36.070
that we have.

00:49:36.070 --> 00:49:36.750
ILYSE SCHAPIRO:
We definitely will

00:49:36.750 --> 00:49:38.250
AUDIENCE: And make
a recommendation.

00:49:38.250 --> 00:49:38.893
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:38.893 --> 00:49:40.142
HALLIE RICH: Try them all out.

00:49:40.142 --> 00:49:40.683
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:49:40.683 --> 00:49:42.290
Thanks again for coming.

00:49:42.290 --> 00:49:44.400
I just wanted to dig in
on the dairy question

00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:45.700
a little bit more.

00:49:45.700 --> 00:49:49.190
So what kind of milk packs
the most nutritional punch?

00:49:49.190 --> 00:49:52.520
So I have two kids, and the
ultrapasteurized, I found,

00:49:52.520 --> 00:49:54.724
is just really expensive water.

00:49:54.724 --> 00:49:55.640
ILYSE SCHAPIRO: Right.

00:49:55.640 --> 00:49:58.690
AUDIENCE: So what's the deal,
ultrapasteurized, pasteurized,

00:49:58.690 --> 00:50:00.080
homogenized, non-homogenized.

00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:04.250
What is the best from a
nutritional standpoint?

00:50:04.250 --> 00:50:07.620
ILYSE SCHAPIRO: I would say the
best is-- and I wouldn't get,

00:50:07.620 --> 00:50:09.230
and part of what we
speak about, don't

00:50:09.230 --> 00:50:11.100
feel like you have to get
wrapped up in all those terms.

00:50:11.100 --> 00:50:12.200
AUDIENCE: Totally.

00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:13.370
I'm already there.

00:50:13.370 --> 00:50:15.990
ILYSE SCHAPIRO: Trust me, we
all have, or a lot of my clients

00:50:15.990 --> 00:50:16.489
have.

00:50:16.489 --> 00:50:17.950
Don't stress yourself out.

00:50:17.950 --> 00:50:19.120
Go buy for your kids.

00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:21.570
Go buy organic, either--
how old are they?

00:50:21.570 --> 00:50:22.320
AUDIENCE: 2 and 3.

00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:23.090
ILYSE SCHAPIRO: 2 and 3.

00:50:23.090 --> 00:50:24.506
AUDIENCE: No,
organic is baseline.

00:50:24.506 --> 00:50:26.230
HALLIE RICH: Obviously.

00:50:26.230 --> 00:50:28.370
I don't think you have
to drive yourself nuts.

00:50:28.370 --> 00:50:31.904
Just go buy the organic
2%, or even whole milk

00:50:31.904 --> 00:50:33.820
depending on what your
pediatrician recommends

00:50:33.820 --> 00:50:34.769
for them at this age.

00:50:34.769 --> 00:50:36.810
I don't know their weights
or anything like that.

00:50:36.810 --> 00:50:39.987
And don't stress yourself
out about the ultrafiltered--

00:50:39.987 --> 00:50:41.153
AUDIENCE: It doesn't matter?

00:50:41.153 --> 00:50:42.230
ILYSE SCHAPIRO: No.

00:50:42.230 --> 00:50:45.230
Everybody's-- and kind of along
with that question that we just

00:50:45.230 --> 00:50:48.710
asked, unfortunately everybody's
looking to make a buck,

00:50:48.710 --> 00:50:51.320
and everybody's looking to
get you to buy their product

00:50:51.320 --> 00:50:53.410
because they're
different and distinct.

00:50:53.410 --> 00:50:57.290
So sometimes don't get
yourself stressed out about it.

00:50:57.290 --> 00:50:59.940
And sometimes go for
the most simple thing.

00:50:59.940 --> 00:51:02.105
AUDIENCE: So they're
kind of created equal

00:51:02.105 --> 00:51:05.014
from a pasteurization,
ultra versus regular.

00:51:05.014 --> 00:51:05.930
ILYSE SCHAPIRO: Right.

00:51:05.930 --> 00:51:08.874
To be honest, I don't
know in detail about that.

00:51:08.874 --> 00:51:10.790
I'm happy to look it up
and you can e-mail me,

00:51:10.790 --> 00:51:12.520
or I can grab your
e-mail at the end,

00:51:12.520 --> 00:51:14.390
because now you
have me thinking.

00:51:14.390 --> 00:51:18.460
But I would say, to me, basic
organic whole milk or 2%

00:51:18.460 --> 00:51:19.402
milk is, why not?

00:51:19.402 --> 00:51:21.110
AUDIENCE: I've just
done so much research

00:51:21.110 --> 00:51:23.100
and I know there's
so much focus on it

00:51:23.100 --> 00:51:25.210
now, so I just wanted to
hear your point of view.

00:51:25.210 --> 00:51:26.200
ILYSE SCHAPIRO: Right.

00:51:26.200 --> 00:51:27.100
But now I'm going
to go look it up.

00:51:27.100 --> 00:51:27.810
AUDIENCE: It's an
interesting topic.

00:51:27.810 --> 00:51:29.185
ILYSE SCHAPIRO:
Yeah, absolutely.

00:51:29.185 --> 00:51:30.367
Perfect.

00:51:30.367 --> 00:51:31.450
AUDIENCE: I'll let you go.

00:51:31.450 --> 00:51:33.579
She was waiting.

00:51:33.579 --> 00:51:34.120
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:51:34.120 --> 00:51:34.620
I'm sorry.

00:51:34.620 --> 00:51:36.000
I'm short too.

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:37.820
I was actually recently
advised by a doctor

00:51:37.820 --> 00:51:40.260
for a medical condition to go
on a low-sodium diet, which

00:51:40.260 --> 00:51:42.000
is the worst thing
in the world for me,

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:44.610
because I put salt
on salt, literally.

00:51:44.610 --> 00:51:48.630
And everything is just
really bland to me now.

00:51:48.630 --> 00:51:51.900
I found Mrs. Dash
and New Salt to use,

00:51:51.900 --> 00:51:54.200
like when I'm cooking
chicken or fish or something.

00:51:54.200 --> 00:51:56.302
But it's still super bland.

00:51:56.302 --> 00:51:58.835
And I'm shocked by how many
condiments and dressings have--

00:51:58.835 --> 00:51:59.710
ILYSE SCHAPIRO: Tons.

00:51:59.710 --> 00:52:00.440
HALLIE RICH:
Everything has salt.

00:52:00.440 --> 00:52:01.980
AUDIENCE: That's where I
used to get most of my salt,

00:52:01.980 --> 00:52:04.140
and it really-- I used
to live on ketchup.

00:52:04.140 --> 00:52:05.895
Now I don't even use it.

00:52:05.895 --> 00:52:09.710
Do you have advice
on snacks and ways

00:52:09.710 --> 00:52:11.960
to dress your food so
that it has a little bit

00:52:11.960 --> 00:52:15.644
more flavor and taste, because
I just don't enjoy [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:15.644 --> 00:52:17.560
ILYSE SCHAPIRO: Well, I
would say for cooking,

00:52:17.560 --> 00:52:19.710
garlic, cooking
with fresh garlic,

00:52:19.710 --> 00:52:21.920
I feel like really helps
enhance the flavor,

00:52:21.920 --> 00:52:24.810
and whether you use olive oil
or coconut oil or something

00:52:24.810 --> 00:52:26.390
like that, for sure.

00:52:26.390 --> 00:52:30.100
And trying out those spices,
but also different spices,

00:52:30.100 --> 00:52:34.610
like paprika and cayenne, and
garlic powder, onion powder,

00:52:34.610 --> 00:52:36.830
the ones that don't
have sodium in it.

00:52:36.830 --> 00:52:40.490
But I would just try
experimenting with spices,

00:52:40.490 --> 00:52:42.110
or even just sauteing an onion.

00:52:42.110 --> 00:52:44.284
And then for snacks,
unfortunately you

00:52:44.284 --> 00:52:45.700
have to be really
careful, but you

00:52:45.700 --> 00:52:50.050
could do an apple with
unsalted almond butter,

00:52:50.050 --> 00:52:53.291
or an apple with unsalted
peanut butter, or unsalted nuts.

00:52:53.291 --> 00:52:55.290
AUDIENCE: What about more
on-the-go type snacks,

00:52:55.290 --> 00:52:56.910
because like you, I have kids.

00:52:56.910 --> 00:52:58.482
I'm always on the go.

00:52:58.482 --> 00:53:00.690
And they're always going
for the pretzels and things,

00:53:00.690 --> 00:53:02.760
and I'm just starving because
I can't just cut fresh fruit

00:53:02.760 --> 00:53:04.384
and bring it around
with me everywhere.

00:53:04.384 --> 00:53:05.412
It's not easy.

00:53:05.412 --> 00:53:07.950
ILYSE SCHAPIRO: Banana, apple.

00:53:07.950 --> 00:53:11.330
But a lot of companies make
the unsalted to-go nuts,

00:53:11.330 --> 00:53:13.000
so you could put
that in your bag.

00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:15.000
Even some-- I don't know
off the top of my head.

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:16.312
I'd actually have to look.

00:53:16.312 --> 00:53:17.770
Some of the Kind
bars, but I'd have

00:53:17.770 --> 00:53:21.805
to look, to be honest with you,
on the label on the sodium.

00:53:21.805 --> 00:53:23.099
But some of those things.

00:53:23.099 --> 00:53:25.390
But even now, they make peanut
butter and almond butter

00:53:25.390 --> 00:53:26.360
packets, which is awesome.

00:53:26.360 --> 00:53:28.651
So I know you're not going
carry around a jar with you,

00:53:28.651 --> 00:53:32.420
but you could carry around that
and an apple and-- it's great,

00:53:32.420 --> 00:53:32.920
though.

00:53:32.920 --> 00:53:35.729
I picked some up at
a seminar yesterday.

00:53:35.729 --> 00:53:37.020
HALLIE RICH: Low sodium's hard.

00:53:37.020 --> 00:53:37.490
ILYSE SCHAPIRO: It is hard.

00:53:37.490 --> 00:53:38.530
HALLIE RICH: Sodium's
like the new--

00:53:38.530 --> 00:53:39.060
AUDIENCE: It's the worst.

00:53:39.060 --> 00:53:41.080
HALLIE RICH: Yeah, because when
we talk about taking things

00:53:41.080 --> 00:53:42.996
out and putting things
back in, a lot of times

00:53:42.996 --> 00:53:45.397
they're putting in salt,
because it's the great flavor

00:53:45.397 --> 00:53:47.730
masker, which is why nothing
tastes good to you anymore,

00:53:47.730 --> 00:53:48.894
because there's no salt.

00:53:48.894 --> 00:53:49.960
AUDIENCE: Retraining my mouth.

00:53:49.960 --> 00:53:51.030
ILYSE SCHAPIRO: No, that's
exactly what you have to do.

00:53:51.030 --> 00:53:51.930
HALLIE RICH: And it's
going to take time.

00:53:51.930 --> 00:53:52.880
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:53:52.880 --> 00:53:54.339
Thank you.

00:53:54.339 --> 00:53:55.130
AUDIENCE: Hi there.

00:53:55.130 --> 00:53:57.400
Thanks for coming over
for us and educating us.

00:53:57.400 --> 00:53:58.870
Two questions.

00:53:58.870 --> 00:54:00.520
I missed the first
part of the session,

00:54:00.520 --> 00:54:03.145
so I don't know if you answered
that question, should we really

00:54:03.145 --> 00:54:05.680
scoop out our bagel, or
if it's part of the book.

00:54:05.680 --> 00:54:06.590
ILYSE SCHAPIRO: We'll
answer it in a second.

00:54:06.590 --> 00:54:07.530
What's your second question?

00:54:07.530 --> 00:54:09.070
AUDIENCE: And the second
question, how bad is honey,

00:54:09.070 --> 00:54:10.770
because I saw one
of your slides,

00:54:10.770 --> 00:54:12.430
stay away from sugar and honey.

00:54:12.430 --> 00:54:15.140
But I don't use sugar at all.

00:54:15.140 --> 00:54:17.375
But I kind of use honey
as a supplement sometimes.

00:54:17.375 --> 00:54:19.494
Is honey as bad as sugar?

00:54:19.494 --> 00:54:20.910
ILYSE SCHAPIRO:
So honey is sugar,

00:54:20.910 --> 00:54:22.610
and we just want you
to recognize that.

00:54:22.610 --> 00:54:25.080
Now if you're using one teaspoon
or two teaspoons of honey

00:54:25.080 --> 00:54:30.230
per day, that is absolutely
fine, unless you have diabetes.

00:54:30.230 --> 00:54:31.355
So don't stress about that.

00:54:31.355 --> 00:54:33.104
If you're using globs
of honey because you

00:54:33.104 --> 00:54:35.200
think it's healthier for
you, then we just say,

00:54:35.200 --> 00:54:36.040
just watch out.

00:54:36.040 --> 00:54:38.490
And kind of a cool little
tidbit, some people

00:54:38.490 --> 00:54:41.140
use local honey to
prevent allergies.

00:54:41.140 --> 00:54:41.997
Is that what you do?

00:54:41.997 --> 00:54:42.580
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:54:42.580 --> 00:54:42.840
ILYSE SCHAPIRO: Yeah.

00:54:42.840 --> 00:54:43.940
AUDIENCE: That's
what I was told.

00:54:43.940 --> 00:54:44.814
ILYSE SCHAPIRO: Yeah.

00:54:44.814 --> 00:54:46.340
People swear by it
instead of taking

00:54:46.340 --> 00:54:48.009
Claritin or allergy medicine.

00:54:48.009 --> 00:54:49.800
So again, as long as
you're sticking to one

00:54:49.800 --> 00:54:51.570
to two teaspoons
per day, that's fine

00:54:51.570 --> 00:54:54.690
as long as your sugar intake
for the rest of the day is low.

00:54:54.690 --> 00:54:56.315
You want to talk
about the bagel scoop?

00:54:56.315 --> 00:54:56.690
HALLIE RICH: Sure.

00:54:56.690 --> 00:54:58.270
Yeah, I mean we
just say if you're

00:54:58.270 --> 00:54:59.760
trying to watch your
weight, scooping bagels is

00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:00.440
a great thing.

00:55:00.440 --> 00:55:02.648
We just said, be careful
not to eat the scooping when

00:55:02.648 --> 00:55:05.050
you take it out, and not
to overfill your bagel.

00:55:05.050 --> 00:55:06.800
And if you don't want
to scoop, try things

00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:09.070
like flagels, deli
thins, just half a bagel.

00:55:09.070 --> 00:55:12.040
Those can be great options
to not scooping your bagel

00:55:12.040 --> 00:55:13.300
if you don't want to.

00:55:13.300 --> 00:55:15.230
ILYSE SCHAPIRO: And feel free to
take some of the Rainbow Bagels

00:55:15.230 --> 00:55:15.510
home.

00:55:15.510 --> 00:55:16.080
There's plenty.

00:55:16.080 --> 00:55:17.240
HALLIE RICH: Especially
those of you who have kids.

00:55:17.240 --> 00:55:17.640
ILYSE SCHAPIRO: Yeah.

00:55:17.640 --> 00:55:18.370
Take some home.

00:55:21.510 --> 00:55:23.548
AUDIENCE: Going back
to the avocados,

00:55:23.548 --> 00:55:25.452
something I read
about is there's

00:55:25.452 --> 00:55:28.000
a difference between
omega-3 and omega-6,

00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:30.898
and people say omega-3s are good
and they come from fatty fish

00:55:30.898 --> 00:55:32.260
and stuff like that.

00:55:32.260 --> 00:55:34.880
But avocados and eggs
have a lot of omega-6.

00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:37.680
Could you elaborate a little
bit on what the difference is

00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:40.900
and why it matters, if
it does matter at all?

00:55:40.900 --> 00:55:43.090
HALLIE RICH: So omega-6s
do get a bad rap.

00:55:43.090 --> 00:55:45.856
But where you're talking
about things from food,

00:55:45.856 --> 00:55:47.730
I wouldn't really
worry about it.

00:55:47.730 --> 00:55:51.510
I mean, it's more kind of
my industry than the food

00:55:51.510 --> 00:55:52.010
industry.

00:55:52.010 --> 00:55:54.870
So when we're talking about
an avocado or anything that

00:55:54.870 --> 00:55:58.280
has omegas in it, I wouldn't
worry at all about that.

00:55:58.280 --> 00:56:01.330
I think that's a
manufactured controversy.

00:56:01.330 --> 00:56:03.340
When you're talking
about supplements,

00:56:03.340 --> 00:56:05.720
I would take an
omega-3 with a DHA

00:56:05.720 --> 00:56:07.880
if that's something that
you're instead in taking.

00:56:07.880 --> 00:56:10.730
That has EPA and DHA
for an omega product,

00:56:10.730 --> 00:56:13.410
and I would stay away
from the omega-6s.

00:56:13.410 --> 00:56:15.000
But when it comes to food.

00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:16.320
I think it's a manufactured--

00:56:16.320 --> 00:56:17.236
ILYSE SCHAPIRO: Right.

00:56:17.236 --> 00:56:18.700
I think the point
is our diet does

00:56:18.700 --> 00:56:20.530
have a lot of
omega-6's in it just

00:56:20.530 --> 00:56:22.120
naturally between
the foods we eat,

00:56:22.120 --> 00:56:25.000
so there's no need to add
to it with a supplement.

00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:28.787
Avocado and eggs, I don't know
if they have omega-6's in it

00:56:28.787 --> 00:56:29.870
now that I think about it.

00:56:29.870 --> 00:56:32.730
But I know certain oils do.

00:56:32.730 --> 00:56:35.310
So I'd have to look that
up, because I've always

00:56:35.310 --> 00:56:38.311
thought avocados and
eggs had the omega-3s.

00:56:38.311 --> 00:56:40.310
So we're just saying in
general, the food supply

00:56:40.310 --> 00:56:42.490
does have omega-6s,
so there's no reason

00:56:42.490 --> 00:56:44.620
to take an extra
omega-6 supplement.

00:56:44.620 --> 00:56:47.485
In fact, we need more omega-3s
to balance out the 6s.

00:56:47.485 --> 00:56:49.610
HALLIE RICH: And with that,
if you're looking again

00:56:49.610 --> 00:56:52.310
for a supplement, take something
that has EPA or DHA in it.

00:56:52.310 --> 00:56:54.150
And if you get like
those digusting

00:56:54.150 --> 00:56:57.615
ferd-- I can't even
speak-- fishy burps

00:56:57.615 --> 00:56:58.490
from it or something.

00:56:58.490 --> 00:56:59.630
There's different
ways to take it.

00:56:59.630 --> 00:57:01.040
ILYSE SCHAPIRO: Nine
months pregnant.

00:57:01.040 --> 00:57:02.081
HALLIE RICH: Yeah, sorry.

00:57:02.081 --> 00:57:04.600
Pregnancy brain is a real thing.

00:57:04.600 --> 00:57:06.550
We get to that in our
book, and you can always

00:57:06.550 --> 00:57:08.570
email either one of us if
you have specific questions

00:57:08.570 --> 00:57:09.405
about any of that stuff.

00:57:09.405 --> 00:57:09.670
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:57:09.670 --> 00:57:10.290
Thank you.

00:57:10.290 --> 00:57:11.586
ILYSE SCHAPIRO: Thank you.

00:57:11.586 --> 00:57:12.460
And right, everybody.

00:57:12.460 --> 00:57:13.150
HALLIE RICH: Thank you guys.

00:57:13.150 --> 00:57:15.358
ILYSE SCHAPIRO: Yes, thank
you so much for having us.

00:57:15.358 --> 00:57:17.730
[APPLAUSE]
