00:00:01.287 --> 00:00:02.370
FEMALE SPEAKER: All right.

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:03.910
Good afternoon, everybody.

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:05.480
Thank you for coming today.

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.600
So today we have a
very special guest.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.290
Just a little bit of
background on Ruth.

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:14.830
So Ruth Sherman works with
top CEOs, celebrities,

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:16.750
and small-business
entrepreneurs to help

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.340
them become charismatic
speakers, presenters,

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.315
and video and media darlings.

00:00:21.315 --> 00:00:23.690
Ruth has worked with some of
the world's largest and most

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:27.800
prestigious companies,
top CEOs, movie stars,

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.470
international celebrities.

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.549
Four of her clients have
won Oscars, and one of them

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:34.920
has won the Pulitzer Prize.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.550
Her many film project include
"Dallas Buyer's Club,"

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.940
"Insidious: Chapter
3," her first horror

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.840
film, and the recently-opened
"Suffragette" and "Trumbo."

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.290
She loves getting
paid to watch movies.

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.500
But you don't have to be
famous to work with Ruth,

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.740
and she's here today with
us, so that's awesome.

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.110
Her new book, "Speakrets"--
which is outside.

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:54.340
Everybody should grab a copy.

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.970
It's amazing.

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:59.180
I read it cover to cover-- "The
30 Best, Most Effective, Most

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.180
Overlooked Marketing and
Personal Branding Essentials"

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.560
is the name of her book, is
available on Amazon and just

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.060
outside this room.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.220
She's also a
widely-quoted expert

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.010
on political communication
who knows that the better

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:13.870
communicator always wins.

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:17.520
Her first career was as one of
a handful of successful New York

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.380
jingle-singers,
whose voice was heard

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.380
around the world on commercials
such as Coca-Cola, Ford,

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.460
Michelob, and Clairol,
and as a backup singer

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.010
for major recording artists.

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:30.080
Ruth holds a Master's Degree
in Speech and Interpersonal

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.150
Communication from NYU.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:33.734
Everybody please
welcome Ruth Sherman.

00:01:33.734 --> 00:01:34.733
RUTH SHERMAN: Thank you.

00:01:34.733 --> 00:01:35.560
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.880
Thanks, [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.440
Thank you.

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.370
First things first.

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.970
In order for us to
have this discussion,

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.900
you've got to leave your
politics at the door.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:52.200
Do I have your pledge
that you'll do that?

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.740
Yes?

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:53.505
Shake your head.

00:01:53.505 --> 00:01:54.380
Just shake your head.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:55.637
Yes. [LAUGHTER]

00:01:55.637 --> 00:01:57.470
This is the hardest
thing to do, by the way.

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.030
It is very hard to not have
opinions about candidates,

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.700
because what I'm doing
today, of course,

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.400
is using them to talk about
speaking and communication,

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.180
because we're in the midst of
this presidential campaign.

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:14.390
So this is one presentation
that I roll out every four years

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.330
because I think it's so
fascinating to watch how

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.810
these candidates communicate
and influence our vote,

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.850
or, at least, try to.

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.490
So leave your
politics at the door.

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.810
The only way that I know that
I am doing it right, when I get

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.070
interviewed by
media, because they

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:34.410
call me to ask me
what do I think

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.800
about what the
candidates are doing,

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.710
and who is doing a good
job, and who might win,

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.910
which I don't predict quite yet.

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.494
They always ask me, and I
always have to be very careful.

00:02:45.494 --> 00:02:47.160
We all have our biases,
and the only way

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.201
I know I'm doing it right
is when I get hate-mail

00:02:49.201 --> 00:02:51.650
from both sides. [LAUGHTER] OK?

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:52.420
All right.

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.750
So there are a couple of reasons
that I do this presentation

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.050
every few years.

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:00.520
The first reason is that
I think it's important.

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.420
As an expert in
communication, and somebody

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.890
who's doing this for
a very long time,

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:10.000
I think it's my civic
duty to inform the voters,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.360
and people who come
to my presentations,

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.760
about just how the candidates
use these communications

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.770
techniques to
influence our vote,

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:19.570
as I mentioned a moment ago.

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.680
The second reason is
because this is a master

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:23.900
class in public speaking.

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.020
I was talking to a few of you
here before we got started.

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.800
And it's important to
pay attention to this,

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.720
because we can learn what to do,
and, of course, what not to do.

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.480
And it happens in every
single-- it's constant.

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.230
It's wallpaper.

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.040
You are bombarded
with opportunities

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.240
to see these people, and
to watch them, and to learn

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:50.220
by simply observing them.

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.980
So those are the two reasons
that I do this presentation.

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.230
So today we'll make
some connections

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.960
between what they
do and what you

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:02.380
can do to advance in your
careers and in your businesses.

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.660
And so here they are.

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.260
This was the second
debate, I think,

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:09.710
and some people are gone now.

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:13.630
So tomorrow night, you'll see
the three people in the center

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:14.760
for the Democratic Debate.

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.040
How many of you are going
to spend Saturday evening

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.220
watching the Democratic Debate?

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:20.870
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:21.690
OK.

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:22.810
Fair enough.

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:24.130
And you guys are lucky.

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:25.890
You don't have to
wait until 9:00.

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:27.080
I'm in the New York area.

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.260
I have to wait until
9:00 PM to watch that.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.510
But you can watch it,
of course, any time,

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:34.150
because they'll
record it and you'll

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.380
be able to watch it on YouTube.

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:39.100
So the three in the
middle will be there.

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:43.430
And then, the
Republicans, a few of them

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.110
are now gone, or on
different stages,

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:49.740
and so, yeah,
things have changed,

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.040
and they're changing rapidly.

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.170
It's a moving target.

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:54.580
And it's something that I
have to constantly figure

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.175
out and work on,
because, again, there

00:04:57.175 --> 00:04:59.890
have been so many debates
and so many changes

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:02.210
that it's been
difficult to keep up.

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:03.930
I couldn't even update
from the other day

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:05.610
because I was so busy.

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:10.250
But there was a debate on
Tuesday, I think it was.

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:12.610
So it doesn't matter
whether you want

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.440
to move to Pennsylvania
Avenue, you

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.640
want to move into 1600
Pennsylvania Avenue,

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.770
or you want to move
up in Silicon Valley.

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:23.940
The better communicator, or the
best communicator, will win.

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:28.360
I want to make it very clear--
you do not have to be perfect.

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.400
You do not have to be great.

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.580
You just have to be better
than the competition.

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:34.560
It's like the Olympics.

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.880
You just have to win by
a fraction of a point.

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.780
And that is the way it
is for these candidates,

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:41.990
and for you, as well.

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:47.660
So there are five components
to candidate communications

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:48.960
success.

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.780
Let's list five components.

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:54.400
The first is presentation
skills and public speaking.

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:55.470
This is the biggest one.

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:56.640
It's the most important one.

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:59.460
It's the way that we get to
know them a little better,

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:03.530
or they try to get us to
know them a little better.

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:06.690
And we'll spend most of the
time on the presentation skills

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:09.100
and public speaking today.

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:10.950
The second one is content.

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:11.660
Message.

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:14.620
So we're going to spend
some time on their slogans,

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.250
and what they use
for their slogans.

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:19.300
But generally, it's
their messaging.

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:21.270
What exactly are they saying?

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:24.390
And then, beyond the
message itself, discipline.

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:27.180
How often do they
repeat the message?

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:29.070
Do they stick with
the same message?

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:31.446
Are they testing some new
versions and variations

00:06:31.446 --> 00:06:32.070
of the message?

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:36.230
And how do they put those--
the sloganeering is great,

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:38.770
I find it fascinating,
because if you put together

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:41.774
slogans in a certain way, they
should roll off your tongue

00:06:41.774 --> 00:06:43.190
and they should
be very memorable,

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:47.640
and they should have some
kind of an emotional impact.

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:52.180
The third issue is the
personal narrative.

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:53.840
This is the story
of who they are,

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:58.660
how they come to be who they
are, and how they're formed.

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:01.800
And this is another
way that we end up

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:06.190
feeling like he or she
gets me, or he or she

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:08.140
doesn't get me at all.

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:11.570
And then there are two final
communication components

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:14.590
that we're not going to have
time to talk about here today.

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:19.000
And the fourth one is
interpersonal communication,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.710
one-on-one communication,
or one-on-small-groups,

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:23.740
that's very important
in business,

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:27.740
hugely important in business,
but we don't have time to go

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:29.470
into that in any detail today.

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:31.530
One of the things
that you should know

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:33.650
is that, as the
race narrows down,

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:37.890
and the press pool
isn't so spread out,

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:41.620
spread so thin, that they
will be following the two

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:43.150
eventual nominees.

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:46.310
And what will happen
is, these nominees

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:49.030
will be photographed in the
diners, in the boutiques,

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:53.940
in the shops, in the businesses,
the manufacturing businesses.

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:56.610
Maybe they'll come to Google,
but only to get money.

00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:57.300
Right?

00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:59.383
Because they only come to
New York and Connecticut

00:07:59.383 --> 00:08:00.590
to get money.

00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:01.950
We never see them, either.

00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:05.730
But so they come,
they'll be photographed,

00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:11.100
and reporters will report on
how they interact, one-on-one,

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:13.239
with the "regular folks," OK?

00:08:13.239 --> 00:08:14.780
That's what they
think of, and that's

00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:17.570
how they qualify it--
the regular folks.

00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:21.060
And then the final communication
component is the spouse.

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:23.600
Not going to talk about
that at all today.

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:26.720
[LAUGHTER] Very hard to talk
about for obvious reasons.

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:30.440
But we do have some interesting
spousal possibilities

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:38.549
for the potential First
Spouse this time, right?

00:08:38.549 --> 00:08:42.110
So let's start with the public
speaking and presentation.

00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:47.730
And I want to play
a video or two.

00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:51.640
This was Barack Obama at the
2004 Democratic Convention.

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:53.621
How many of you have seen this?

00:08:53.621 --> 00:08:54.120
All right.

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:55.680
This is just a clip.

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:56.810
Look at how young he looks.

00:08:56.810 --> 00:08:57.577
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:08:57.577 --> 00:09:00.986
[APPLAUSE]

00:09:02.447 --> 00:09:04.700
-It is that fundamental belief.

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:11.380
It is that fundamental belief--
I am my brother's keeper,

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:16.280
I am my sister's keeper--
that makes this country work.

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:20.560
It's what allows us to
pursue our individual dreams,

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:24.740
and yet still come together
as one American family.

00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:26.750
E pluribus unum.

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:30.310
Out of many, one.

00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:32.800
Now, even as we
speak, there are those

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:34.990
who are preparing to divide us.

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:38.000
The spin masters, the
negative-ad peddlers,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.920
who embrace the politics
of anything goes.

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:44.850
Well, I say to
them tonight, there

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:48.210
is not a liberal America
and a conservative America.

00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:50.505
There is the United
States of America.

00:09:50.505 --> 00:09:52.165
[CHEERING]

00:09:52.165 --> 00:09:55.695
There is not a black
America and a white America,

00:09:55.695 --> 00:09:58.880
a Latino America,
an Asian America.

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:01.115
There's the United
States of America.

00:10:01.115 --> 00:10:04.280
[CHEERING]

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:08.430
The pundits-- the pundits like
to slice and dice our country

00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:10.980
into red states and blue states.

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:14.370
Red states for Republicans,
blue states for Democrats.

00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:15.740
But I've got news for them, too.

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:18.700
We worship an awesome
god in the blue states,

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:21.730
and we don't like Federal agents
poking around in our libraries

00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:22.580
in the red states.

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:25.460
[CHEERING]

00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:28.160
We coach little league
in the blue states,

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:30.430
and yes, we've got some Gay
friends in the red states.

00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:32.204
[CHEERING]

00:10:32.204 --> 00:10:35.340
There are patriots who
opposed the war in Iraq,

00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:37.555
and there are patriots who
supported the war in Iraq.

00:10:37.555 --> 00:10:38.138
[END PLAYBACK]

00:10:38.138 --> 00:10:39.610
RUTH SHERMAN: OK.

00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:42.247
So again, look at what
happens to you when you spend

00:10:42.247 --> 00:10:43.455
eight years as the President.

00:10:43.455 --> 00:10:46.560
You get grey, and you get lined.

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:48.730
[LAUGHS] All right.

00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:50.870
I remember where I was
when this happened.

00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:53.120
How many of you
remember where you were?

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:53.700
Right.

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:54.199
OK.

00:10:54.199 --> 00:10:57.270
So a memorable talk, you
will remember where you were

00:10:57.270 --> 00:10:58.367
and what you were doing.

00:10:58.367 --> 00:10:59.200
I was in my bedroom.

00:10:59.200 --> 00:10:59.910
I was picking up.

00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:01.980
I was watching the
Democratic Convention.

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:04.030
It's such a boring
thing to watch.

00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:06.370
Because they get up, most of
them are terrible speakers,

00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:08.551
and they speak, and it
goes on and on and on.

00:11:08.551 --> 00:11:09.050
Right?

00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:12.169
And then I remember hearing him.

00:11:12.169 --> 00:11:13.210
I didn't know who he was.

00:11:13.210 --> 00:11:14.560
I'd never heard of him before.

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:18.970
And I remember hearing his
voice, and doing a double-take.

00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:22.570
Sitting down on the end of my
bed and listening to his talk,

00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:24.840
and thinking, he's
going to be somebody.

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:26.490
Little did I know.

00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:28.340
Four years later,
he's president.

00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:30.400
Four years later,
he's president.

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:30.900
All right.

00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:33.055
Let's take a look
at another video.

00:11:33.055 --> 00:11:33.960
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:36.570
-Rudy Giuliani said he thought
that there may be some Reagan

00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:38.480
qualities to Donald Trump.

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:43.707
So Carly Fiorina, is he
getting the better of you?

00:11:43.707 --> 00:11:44.290
-I don't know.

00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:46.840
I didn't get a phone
call from Bill Clinton

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:48.147
before I jumped in the race.

00:11:48.147 --> 00:11:50.230
Did any of you get a phone
call from Bill Clinton?

00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:50.990
I didn't.

00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:53.540
Maybe it's because I hadn't
given money the foundation,

00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:57.294
or donated to his
wife's Senate campaign.

00:11:57.294 --> 00:11:58.960
Here's the thing that
I would ask Donald

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:00.200
Trump, in all seriousness.

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:03.450
He is the Party's front-runner
right now, and good for him.

00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:07.060
I think he's tapped into
an anger that people feel.

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:09.860
They're sick of
politics as usual.

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:12.660
You know, whatever
your issue, your cause,

00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:15.690
the festering problem you
hoped would be resolved,

00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:17.520
the political class
has failed you.

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:18.470
That's just a fact.

00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:20.700
And that's what Donald
Trump taps into.

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:21.990
I would also just say this.

00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:25.830
Since he has changed his mind
on amnesty, on health care,

00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:27.890
and on abortion,
I would just ask,

00:12:27.890 --> 00:12:30.780
what are the principles
by which he will govern?

00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:33.510
-In an interview last week
in "Rolling Stone Magazine,"

00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:35.370
Donald Trump said the
following about you.

00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:37.160
Quote, "Look at that face.

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:38.570
Would anyone vote for that?

00:12:38.570 --> 00:12:43.854
Can you imagine that the
face of our next President?"

00:12:43.854 --> 00:12:45.270
-You know, it's
interesting to me.

00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:49.690
Mr. Trump said this he
heard Mr. Bush very clearly,

00:12:49.690 --> 00:12:51.370
and what Mr Bush said.

00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:53.880
I think women all over this
country heard very clearly what

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:54.530
Mr. Trump said.

00:12:54.530 --> 00:13:01.955
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:11.050
-I think she's got
a beautiful face,

00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:13.350
and I think she's
a beautiful woman.

00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:14.400
-All right, on that note.

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:14.740
[END PLAYBACK]

00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:16.823
RUTH SHERMAN: And it's if
looks could kill, right?

00:13:16.823 --> 00:13:18.830
Talk about nonverbal
communication.

00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:19.660
All right.

00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:29.360
So one of the
things that I think

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:33.010
is super important to know
is that these two people

00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:36.480
were nobodies before
they communicated

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:39.590
to us in a very skilled way.

00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:40.450
Not Trump.

00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:41.940
He was not a nobody.

00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:44.500
But people didn't know
who Carly Fiorina was.

00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:46.200
You knew who she was.

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:49.090
I know who she is, because
I follow business news.

00:13:49.090 --> 00:13:54.000
But in the rest of the
country, she was an unknown.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.090
She's the only one who made
it from the quote unquote

00:13:57.090 --> 00:14:00.010
"undercard debate"
to the main stage.

00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:02.310
And she's remained there.

00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:05.770
Even though, in between
her debate performances,

00:14:05.770 --> 00:14:09.770
supposedly, what I understand
is her poll numbers decline.

00:14:09.770 --> 00:14:12.650
But her performances
continue to be pretty good.

00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:14.550
She's a gifted communicator.

00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:16.230
But she works at it.

00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:18.730
Same thing for Barack Obama.

00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:20.666
Nobody knew who he was.

00:14:20.666 --> 00:14:25.930
He had been a community
organizer in Chicago.

00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:30.290
He had been a State
Senator, State Legislator,

00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:34.630
and then he got elected
to the US Senate.

00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:38.140
And he was there for
less than three years

00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:39.170
when he started running.

00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:41.380
I think it was about
two years when he

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:42.980
started to run for President.

00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:45.170
So he was a nobody.

00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:48.460
And this was the most
fascinating thing to me,

00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:51.030
because here were two
people nobody's ever

00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:51.850
heard about before.

00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:54.730
Suddenly they're players.

00:14:54.730 --> 00:14:58.070
It opens the door for people.

00:14:58.070 --> 00:15:00.240
And if it opens
the door for them,

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:02.520
it can open the door for you.

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:07.020
So what are presentation skills
and public speaking skills?

00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:08.760
They are all nonverbal.

00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:10.250
They are all nonverbal.

00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:12.150
How you look, how you
sound, how you move.

00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:14.480
And, if you're on a
stage, how you travel.

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:17.310
And when we talk about
traveling on stage,

00:15:17.310 --> 00:15:20.420
it's not standing behind
a lectern, necessarily.

00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:23.510
It's about how you command
the room, or the stage,

00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:25.850
or the platform--
whatever you're on.

00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:30.150
And then voice is
part of how you sound,

00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:33.130
and it's in a
category by itself.

00:15:33.130 --> 00:15:38.140
So let's talk a little bit about
each of the nonverbal codes.

00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:42.060
And we call them codes
because they are exactly that.

00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:47.230
They are simply not using words.

00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:50.210
How we communicate
without using words.

00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:54.190
So one of the big things
that we've heard about

00:15:54.190 --> 00:15:57.460
is Bernie Sanders
and his hand gesture.

00:15:57.460 --> 00:16:01.530
Bernie Sanders has this
hand gesture that he uses.

00:16:01.530 --> 00:16:07.210
When he talks, he punctuate
each syllable of each word.

00:16:07.210 --> 00:16:09.710
And uses his right hand, and
sometimes he gets his left hand

00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:11.230
into the act.

00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:15.980
But he punctuates each
syllable of each word.

00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:18.220
And the problem that
he's had with that

00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:20.750
is that when you
are speaking, you're

00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:23.560
speaking in a faster
manner, your syllables

00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:26.010
are moving more quickly
off your tongue,

00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:28.310
than your hand can move.

00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:30.230
So you're late with your hands.

00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:31.250
OK?

00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:32.750
And we'll see that
in just a second.

00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:36.980
Just slightly late, and I'm
exaggerating, but you're late.

00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:40.120
And it's a bit of a
distraction because of that.

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:42.400
So we're going to take a
look at that in a minute.

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:44.660
But let's talk a little
bit about gestures

00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:47.020
and why they're so important.

00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:51.000
The research shows that
gestures help us think.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.210
They help us think.

00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:54.860
I don't know about
any of you, but when

00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:56.810
you get to a certain
age, like I am,

00:16:56.810 --> 00:16:58.890
you're looking for
words sometimes.

00:16:58.890 --> 00:17:00.250
Trying to find words.

00:17:00.250 --> 00:17:02.620
Sometimes I'm struggling,
trying to find a word,

00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:04.380
and I'm waving my
hand around up here

00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:09.569
as if I can pluck it out of the
air and put it into my brain.

00:17:09.569 --> 00:17:10.849
And many of us do that.

00:17:10.849 --> 00:17:11.829
We use our hands.

00:17:11.829 --> 00:17:14.890
And as we express
ourselves, we use our hands.

00:17:14.890 --> 00:17:17.589
And if you watch
what people do, even

00:17:17.589 --> 00:17:20.780
in interpersonal communication,
you are using their hands.

00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:22.810
If there's a culture
that does not

00:17:22.810 --> 00:17:27.640
use its hands to
accompany the spoken word,

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:29.390
it hasn't been discovered yet.

00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:31.030
Hasn't been discovered yet.

00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:34.080
And one of the ways they
know that hand gestures are

00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:37.820
so important is that blind
people gesture, and deaf people

00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:40.220
gesture in addition to signing.

00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:42.330
So gestures are
hugely important.

00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:43.790
So not only do
they help us think,

00:17:43.790 --> 00:17:46.640
but they help
everyone else learn.

00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:48.480
Nonverbal communication,
the way you look,

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:51.650
sound, move, and travel,
gives meaning to your words.

00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:53.160
It makes you believable.

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:54.875
Give you a quick example.

00:17:54.875 --> 00:17:59.090
If I stood here like this,
and I said, I'm Ruth Sherman,

00:17:59.090 --> 00:18:05.160
and I'm a communications expert,
and if you stay here and listen

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:09.920
to me for an hour, you are
going to learn so much about how

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:13.340
to be a great speaker.

00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:15.300
So what I'm doing
is, I'm contradicting

00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:18.430
what I'm saying with my body
language and my movements.

00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:22.160
Now, you know, people complain
to me when I give that example.

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:25.290
And, well, Ruth, you're
a professional speaker.

00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:26.620
You have to be good at this.

00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:28.540
You have to model the behavior.

00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:31.030
And there's an element
of truth to that.

00:18:31.030 --> 00:18:35.000
But the fact is that anybody
who gets up and talks

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.950
about something that
they're passionate about

00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:39.800
has to be able to
display that passion.

00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:41.680
Because there's so
much competition

00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:45.630
that people will go to the next
person who's able to interest

00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:47.880
and engage that audience.

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:49.530
So display your passion.

00:18:49.530 --> 00:18:51.710
In fact, people
often come to me--

00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:55.680
How many of you feel
if you move too much,

00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:58.020
or you become too
theatrical, you

00:18:58.020 --> 00:18:59.930
think of it as too
theatrical, too slick,

00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:01.210
that it will be inauthentic?

00:19:01.210 --> 00:19:02.959
Raise your hands if
you think that it will

00:19:02.959 --> 00:19:04.230
be inauthentic and not real.

00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:05.120
Yeah.

00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:09.020
And people often ask me,
you know, that's not me,

00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:11.850
it would be phony, it
would not be authentic.

00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:14.780
And my response to that
is that authenticity

00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:18.760
is often misunderstood,
and sometimes overrated.

00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:20.180
And I'll explain
that in a minute.

00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:22.920
And the second thing is,
I don't care how you feel.

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:25.362
I only care-- my clients,
I don't care how you feel.

00:19:25.362 --> 00:19:26.820
I only care how
you look and sound,

00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:28.590
because here's what
I know for sure.

00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:29.820
I'm certain about it.

00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:32.280
That if the way
you look and sound

00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:35.170
is engaging with your
audience, if your audience

00:19:35.170 --> 00:19:38.370
is engaged with you, that
that feedback will make you

00:19:38.370 --> 00:19:40.010
feel confident.

00:19:40.010 --> 00:19:43.280
So it's a feedback loop
that adds to the confidence.

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:46.390
The way you look,
sound, move, and travel.

00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:52.700
Let's take a quick look
at Bernie Sanders' hands.

00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:53.434
Let's see.

00:19:53.434 --> 00:19:54.100
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:56.100
-And what Democratic
Socialism is about,

00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:58.930
is saying that it
is immoral and wrong

00:19:58.930 --> 00:20:04.750
that the top 1/10 of 1% in
this country own almost 90%,

00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:08.560
own almost as much as
wealth as the bottom 90%.

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:11.600
That it is wrong today,
in a rigged economy,

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:16.210
the 57% of all new income
is going to the top 1%.

00:20:16.210 --> 00:20:18.270
That when you look
around the world,

00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:22.710
you see ever other major
country providing health care

00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:26.800
to all people as a right,
except the United States.

00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:29.750
You see every other major
country saying to moms

00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:31.990
that when you have
a baby, we're not

00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:34.450
going to separate you
from your newborn baby,

00:20:34.450 --> 00:20:37.590
because we are going
to have, we are

00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:40.910
going to have medical
and family paid

00:20:40.910 --> 00:20:43.470
leave like every other
country on earth.

00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:46.470
Those are some of the
principles that I believe in.

00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:49.480
And I think we should look
to countries like Denmark,

00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:51.924
like Sweden, and
Norway, and learn

00:20:51.924 --> 00:20:54.340
from what they have accomplished
for their working people.

00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:54.907
[APPLAUSE]

00:20:54.907 --> 00:20:55.490
[END PLAYBACK]

00:20:55.490 --> 00:20:57.156
RUTH SHERMAN: So
Sanders is a little bit

00:20:57.156 --> 00:20:58.540
distracting with his hands.

00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:00.930
And one of the things--
"Time Magazine"

00:21:00.930 --> 00:21:03.160
called me right before
the Democratic debate

00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:05.990
of a couple of weeks
ago, and they said, well,

00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:06.990
what do they have to do?

00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:08.420
And I had been
reading, probably,

00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:10.750
possibly like you did,
that Bernie Sanders wasn't

00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:11.301
practicing.

00:21:11.301 --> 00:21:12.050
Wasn't rehearsing.

00:21:12.050 --> 00:21:13.300
That was not authentic.

00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:13.800
OK.

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:15.216
That wasn't going
to work for him.

00:21:15.216 --> 00:21:16.980
And I said, if what
I'm reading is true,

00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:18.496
I think it's going to hurt him.

00:21:18.496 --> 00:21:19.870
And I think that
it did hurt him.

00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:22.090
I don't think that he was
ready for the TV camera.

00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:26.310
It's very different to
be in a debate situation

00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:30.160
where you are speaking
primarily to the TV audience.

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:34.230
In the room are all people
who agree with you already.

00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:37.830
They're all, or they're all
almost, agreeing with you.

00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:39.880
They're all Democrats
in the room.

00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:44.010
But the people who are
out there are people

00:21:44.010 --> 00:21:45.260
that you have to persuade.

00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:48.730
Because you cannot win with
only one party voting for you.

00:21:48.730 --> 00:21:51.210
You have to have some
votes from the other party,

00:21:51.210 --> 00:21:53.720
and certainly from independents.

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:58.210
The other thing that he does
is he leans on the podium.

00:21:58.210 --> 00:22:01.520
Podiums are made for
six-foot-tall men, not for--

00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:03.580
or six-foot-tall
people, I should say.

00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:05.830
But, you know, he leans
on the podium like this,

00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:07.715
and it is a distraction.

00:22:07.715 --> 00:22:11.150
And it makes him look
older and more hunched

00:22:11.150 --> 00:22:12.230
than he needs to be.

00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:16.470
He's a fit man, and he
simply doesn't have to--

00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:20.320
he has to appeal to a much
broader swath of the electorate

00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:24.150
than he's able to, if
he does it this way.

00:22:24.150 --> 00:22:26.540
The other thing that
he does, of course,

00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:30.540
is he speaks in pretty
much a loud voice.

00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:31.850
You know, his voice is loud.

00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:33.830
It's one volume level.

00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:37.480
Great for the big
arena speeches,

00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:40.200
the kinds of speeches
that he's giving,

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:43.190
and that he's attracting a
lot of people to come to.

00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:44.910
But one of the
things that happens

00:22:44.910 --> 00:22:48.770
when you speak with
one volume level

00:22:48.770 --> 00:22:55.290
is that, if everything's
important, nothing's important.

00:22:55.290 --> 00:22:57.820
So what I noticed--
it was interesting,

00:22:57.820 --> 00:23:00.530
because Carly
Fiorina, I think, is

00:23:00.530 --> 00:23:04.500
a gifted communicator, and a
very-- and she works at it.

00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:07.430
And, you know, it's funny.

00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:09.530
I cannot evaluate
her tenure at HP.

00:23:09.530 --> 00:23:10.090
I cannot.

00:23:10.090 --> 00:23:10.870
I'm not an MBA.

00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:13.050
I don't know whether she
did a good job, whether she

00:23:13.050 --> 00:23:14.240
didn't do a good job.

00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:17.270
I read that she
didn't do a good job.

00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:17.900
All of that.

00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:21.080
I read everything that they
put out there about her.

00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:25.860
But I can absolutely see
how she could have persuaded

00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:29.220
her board of very
smart people to do

00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:33.270
certain things that were perhaps
not good for the company.

00:23:33.270 --> 00:23:34.800
I can see it.

00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:37.020
Now, that is not
what I advocate.

00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:38.312
It don't advocate it.

00:23:38.312 --> 00:23:40.020
I advocate, of course,
knowing your stuff

00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:41.540
and doing good things.

00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:44.070
And being able to communicate
those good things.

00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:48.030
Because the way you speak
is the operational vehicle

00:23:48.030 --> 00:23:49.170
for your message.

00:23:49.170 --> 00:23:50.440
For your knowledge.

00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:52.980
How do you get it
out there to people,

00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:55.460
but for speaking
to people about it?

00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:59.420
And, you know, for all of
the texting and emailing

00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:02.180
and written language
that we use,

00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:04.790
we still speak far more
than we do any of that.

00:24:04.790 --> 00:24:05.799
Far more.

00:24:05.799 --> 00:24:07.590
And we don't even
realize it, because we're

00:24:07.590 --> 00:24:10.320
sitting at our computers,
typing away all the time.

00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:12.660
But the fact is that
we do it far more,

00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:15.570
and it's much more efficient.

00:24:15.570 --> 00:24:17.367
So the speaking voice.

00:24:17.367 --> 00:24:18.700
Talked about the speaking voice.

00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:19.370
I mentioned it.

00:24:19.370 --> 00:24:21.620
It's in a class by
itself because it

00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:23.470
has several components.

00:24:23.470 --> 00:24:26.000
Volume, which we just
talked about with Sanders.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:31.010
It has a tone,
intonation, expression, so

00:24:31.010 --> 00:24:34.680
the way we use pitch, highs
and lows, to express our voice

00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:36.130
and all of the range in between.

00:24:36.130 --> 00:24:40.350
By the way, every language
has its own music.

00:24:40.350 --> 00:24:42.820
Has its own linguistic music.

00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:47.340
So that's why, when we
speak a foreign language,

00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:48.990
our native accent is there.

00:24:48.990 --> 00:24:52.970
Because we're using our
music from our native tongue

00:24:52.970 --> 00:24:56.660
to speak the other language,
the foreign language.

00:24:56.660 --> 00:24:59.060
But the other things
that is has, of course,

00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:02.780
is the accent and dialect, and
then, as I mentioned, volume,

00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:04.590
tone, expression, et cetera.

00:25:04.590 --> 00:25:05.220
And rate.

00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:06.250
And pace.

00:25:06.250 --> 00:25:09.470
So let's listen
to two candidates,

00:25:09.470 --> 00:25:14.480
back to back-- Jeb Bush and
Martin O'Malley, both of whom,

00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:17.900
I think, have beautiful
speaking voices.

00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:19.231
Let's take a quick listen.

00:25:19.231 --> 00:25:19.730
Yeah.

00:25:19.730 --> 00:25:22.607
AUDIENCE: Question, just before
you move on from Sanders,

00:25:22.607 --> 00:25:25.190
why isn't he-- you know, these
campaigns cost tens or hundreds

00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:28.030
of millions of dollars, why, and
it's pretty clear to everybody,

00:25:28.030 --> 00:25:30.457
why hasn't he
actually addressed it?

00:25:30.457 --> 00:25:32.290
RUTH SHERMAN: Your guess
is as good as mine.

00:25:32.290 --> 00:25:34.250
I don't have inside information.

00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:34.750
Sadly.

00:25:34.750 --> 00:25:36.840
AUDIENCE: Do you think he
knows that this hurting him?

00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:38.790
RUTH SHERMAN: I'm sure
somebody's telling him.

00:25:38.790 --> 00:25:40.950
I would guess
somebody's telling him.

00:25:40.950 --> 00:25:44.550
But either he's not
listening, or he doesn't care,

00:25:44.550 --> 00:25:48.190
or he thinks that it will impact
his quote unquote authenticity.

00:25:48.190 --> 00:25:50.430
And, you know.

00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:51.490
So I don't know.

00:25:51.490 --> 00:25:53.319
But that's the only
thing I can think of.

00:25:53.319 --> 00:25:54.860
That's the only
thing I can think of.

00:25:54.860 --> 00:26:01.974
Let's take a quick look, or
listen, to O'Malley and Bush.

00:26:01.974 --> 00:26:03.765
And I'll try to push
the right button here.

00:26:03.765 --> 00:26:03.920
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:04.795
-To a certain extent.

00:26:04.795 --> 00:26:06.950
I always knew this
was going to be hard.

00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:08.904
I never felt like I
was a front-runner,

00:26:08.904 --> 00:26:10.070
because we hadn't earned it.

00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:13.070
We haven't-- Just starting
out on the journey,

00:26:13.070 --> 00:26:14.310
you've got to go earn it.

00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:16.190
I've got to get better
at debating, I guess,

00:26:16.190 --> 00:26:16.880
or performing.

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:17.871
Whatever that's called.

00:26:17.871 --> 00:26:18.370
And I will.

00:26:18.370 --> 00:26:19.550
I'm a grinder.

00:26:19.550 --> 00:26:20.680
I'm very competitive.

00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:21.480
And so I feel good
about where we are.

00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:22.440
-What is that?

00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:24.310
You keep saying, I'm a grinder.

00:26:24.310 --> 00:26:25.310
What does that mean?

00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:28.020
-That means, I described
it as I eat nails

00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:29.620
before I have breakfast.

00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:30.400
I'm focused.

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:32.470
I'm competitive.

00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:34.555
I've set high
expectations on myself.

00:26:34.555 --> 00:26:35.930
I knew this was
going to be hard.

00:26:35.930 --> 00:26:36.660
- --New leadership.

00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:38.000
You're ready to challenge
her, aren't you?

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.583
-Well, I think that
our country always

00:26:39.583 --> 00:26:42.910
benefits from new leadership
and new perspectives.

00:26:42.910 --> 00:26:44.560
And let's be honest here.

00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:46.580
The Presidency of
the United States

00:26:46.580 --> 00:26:50.480
is not some crown to be
passed between two families.

00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:53.260
It is an awesome
and sacred trust

00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:56.297
to be earned and exercised on
behalf of the American people.

00:26:56.297 --> 00:26:57.880
-Those two families,
Bush and Clinton?

00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:02.580
-Well, right now, George,
you know, any two families.

00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:03.490
But look.

00:27:03.490 --> 00:27:05.960
In order for us to
make an economy again,

00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:08.190
where people can work
hard and get ahead,

00:27:08.190 --> 00:27:10.850
we need a president
who is on our side.

00:27:10.850 --> 00:27:12.270
A president who's
willing to take

00:27:12.270 --> 00:27:14.450
on powerful, wealthy,
special interests,

00:27:14.450 --> 00:27:17.340
in order to restore that
sort of American economy

00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:19.665
where, wherever you start
on the earning spectrum,

00:27:19.665 --> 00:27:21.373
you can get ahead
through your hard work.

00:27:21.373 --> 00:27:21.956
[END PLAYBACK]

00:27:21.956 --> 00:27:24.770
RUTH SHERMAN: So if we
listen to O'Malley and Bush,

00:27:24.770 --> 00:27:26.064
their voices are very pleasing.

00:27:26.064 --> 00:27:28.480
I think it was interesting
when Bush said, "I'm a grinder.

00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:29.360
I'm a grinder."

00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:30.901
It's like, well,
what does that mean?

00:27:30.901 --> 00:27:33.310
And you don't look like
a grinder right now.

00:27:33.310 --> 00:27:34.540
So.

00:27:34.540 --> 00:27:37.530
He could've-- when she asked
him what a grinder was,

00:27:37.530 --> 00:27:40.610
we could have learned what
that was if he expressed it

00:27:40.610 --> 00:27:42.410
a certain way.

00:27:42.410 --> 00:27:44.090
But O'Malley and
Bush are pretty good.

00:27:44.090 --> 00:27:47.000
Now the other thing
that happens--

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.140
I don't have the recordings
of the women's voices,

00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:51.320
except you heard
Carly Fiorina before.

00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:53.720
The women's voices, Hillary
Clinton and Carly Fiorina,

00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:54.230
they're OK.

00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:56.240
They're good enough voices.

00:27:56.240 --> 00:28:00.070
They're not beautiful women's
voices, like-- oh, gosh.

00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:03.920
One of the great women's voices
right now that you could listen

00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:05.130
to would be Diane Sawyer.

00:28:05.130 --> 00:28:10.100
Probably the best public voice
that you can hear from a woman.

00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:13.675
Beautifully articulated and well
done, and very well-trained,

00:28:13.675 --> 00:28:14.660
of course.

00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:16.000
But their voices are good.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:17.160
They're good enough.

00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:21.990
And they've learned
how to create and use

00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:24.360
their leadership voices.

00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:26.470
One of the things that
you don't hear from them,

00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:30.185
that we hear a lot, I
hear a lot among clients,

00:28:30.185 --> 00:28:32.310
and you may hear it a lot,
but I want you to become

00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:34.355
more aware of this, is uptalk.

00:28:34.355 --> 00:28:36.100
Uptalk sounds like this.

00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:37.721
Everything sounds
like a question.

00:28:37.721 --> 00:28:38.220
All right?

00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:39.885
And I'm being very
nasal right now,

00:28:39.885 --> 00:28:41.220
and I'm trying to imitate it.

00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:43.950
And I'm a girl, I'm a
woman, so this is the way

00:28:43.950 --> 00:28:46.930
it sounds when women do it.

00:28:46.930 --> 00:28:47.860
Men do it, too.

00:28:47.860 --> 00:28:51.130
Women get nailed
for more, sadly.

00:28:51.130 --> 00:28:52.230
But that is the way it is.

00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:53.460
So let me play this for you.

00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:57.410
You'll hear another habit,
which is called vocal fry.

00:29:00.350 --> 00:29:03.444
Which I can't do
as well as she can.

00:29:03.444 --> 00:29:04.110
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:06.460
-America's young
women are running out

00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:10.270
of oxygen. What else could
explain why so many of them

00:29:10.270 --> 00:29:12.180
sound like this.

00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:13.930
-So cute.

00:29:13.930 --> 00:29:15.186
So cute.

00:29:15.186 --> 00:29:16.102
-Hi.

00:29:16.102 --> 00:29:16.700
Hi.

00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:17.200
Hi.

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:20.540
-Just kind of like my, you
know, motto, you know, motto.

00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:22.220
-Kim and Khloe
just don't get it.

00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:22.720
Get it.

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:23.220
Get it.

00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:24.472
[END PLAYBACK]

00:29:24.472 --> 00:29:27.385
RUTH SHERMAN:
[LAUGHS] So vocal fry.

00:29:27.385 --> 00:29:28.840
Well, actually,
that's when you--

00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:31.790
you know that the air is
just coming out so slowly.

00:29:31.790 --> 00:29:35.410
You're not pushing the air over
your vocal cords fast enough.

00:29:35.410 --> 00:29:36.520
That's what it is.

00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:40.240
I remember when George W. Bush--
now, that's interesting, too.

00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:42.210
That's an interesting
juxtaposition.

00:29:42.210 --> 00:29:45.350
George W. Bush's
voice was awful.

00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:46.100
Awful.

00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:46.810
Awful.

00:29:46.810 --> 00:29:47.741
Awful.

00:29:47.741 --> 00:29:48.240
All right?

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:50.160
So you would think
brothers sound alike.

00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:51.150
They don't.

00:29:51.150 --> 00:29:51.980
They don't.

00:29:51.980 --> 00:29:56.110
You know, my sisters and I
sound alike, but, I don't know.

00:29:56.110 --> 00:29:59.060
They lost that gene somewhere.

00:29:59.060 --> 00:29:59.560
OK.

00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:00.090
So.

00:30:00.090 --> 00:30:00.590
Voice.

00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:01.470
Very important.

00:30:01.470 --> 00:30:02.160
Be assertive.

00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:03.091
Use your voice.

00:30:03.091 --> 00:30:04.590
You know, if your
voice is too high,

00:30:04.590 --> 00:30:06.980
lower it a little
bit, for women.

00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:10.510
Men, make sure you push that
air over your vocal cords,

00:30:10.510 --> 00:30:12.210
so you don't get vocal fry.

00:30:12.210 --> 00:30:13.027
All right?

00:30:13.027 --> 00:30:15.610
What I was going to say a moment
ago was, when George W. Bush,

00:30:15.610 --> 00:30:17.510
I remember, entertaining
the thought, early

00:30:17.510 --> 00:30:21.010
in his Presidency, of
having Henry Kissinger do

00:30:21.010 --> 00:30:22.566
some kind of work.

00:30:22.566 --> 00:30:24.940
And I thought, oh my god, if
I have to listen-- You know,

00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:26.220
I've been around a long time.

00:30:26.220 --> 00:30:29.250
I remember when Kissinger
was on TV all the time.

00:30:29.250 --> 00:30:31.790
And I thought, if I have to
listen to that every night

00:30:31.790 --> 00:30:33.020
on the news, kill myself.

00:30:33.020 --> 00:30:33.950
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:33.950 --> 00:30:34.670
Kill myself.

00:30:34.670 --> 00:30:35.950
Only because of his voice.

00:30:35.950 --> 00:30:38.580
[LAUGHS] All right.

00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:41.600
The other nonverbal
code of communication

00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:45.270
we can talk about briefly
today is dress and adornment.

00:30:45.270 --> 00:30:47.250
Dress and adornment.

00:30:47.250 --> 00:30:49.210
Everything you
weren't born wearing.

00:30:49.210 --> 00:30:52.160
All the choices that we make.

00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:54.640
All the choices we
make, from the way

00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:58.280
we comb our hair, haircuts,
everything, the whole thing.

00:30:58.280 --> 00:30:59.380
Dress and adornment.

00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:03.120
There's a uniform,
obviously, that politicians

00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:05.380
have to wear if they're
on the debates stages,

00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:07.677
or in a formal setting.

00:31:07.677 --> 00:31:09.510
The men are going to
be wearing a dark suit,

00:31:09.510 --> 00:31:13.170
a light-colored shirt,
and a red or blue-ish tie.

00:31:13.170 --> 00:31:13.880
That's it.

00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:14.380
All right?

00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:17.210
The women have more choices,
and it's more fraught.

00:31:17.210 --> 00:31:17.960
It's more fraught.

00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:20.040
I remember somebody
asking me why

00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:21.910
Hillary Clinton
wore that blue suit

00:31:21.910 --> 00:31:23.380
on the first Democratic debate.

00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:26.950
I said I didn't think she
wanted to stand out as much.

00:31:26.950 --> 00:31:29.150
She didn't want to
be-- Women are always

00:31:29.150 --> 00:31:33.157
going to be approached
or criticized, certainly,

00:31:33.157 --> 00:31:35.240
but there's always going
to be comments about what

00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:36.920
it is that they wear.

00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:38.960
So I think she wanted
to lessen that.

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:41.310
And I think it worked for her.

00:31:41.310 --> 00:31:42.540
So dress and adornment.

00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:44.107
You know, I thought
a lot about what

00:31:44.107 --> 00:31:45.940
I was going to wear to
here, because I'm not

00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:47.520
going to wear this to a bank.

00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:51.240
I'm not wearing this outfit
to J. P. Morgan when I go

00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:52.520
and I talk to them.

00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:55.870
I wore a suit yesterday
at Accenture in San Jose,

00:31:55.870 --> 00:31:57.720
because I was speaking
to a group there.

00:31:57.720 --> 00:31:58.730
It was different.

00:31:58.730 --> 00:32:02.620
I knew, and I asked [? Doma, ?]
what's the dress code?

00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:03.690
And she told me informal.

00:32:03.690 --> 00:32:04.680
And I knew that.

00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:05.670
I knew it was informal.

00:32:05.670 --> 00:32:07.420
But I wanted to
confirm it, because I

00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:08.890
hadn't been here before.

00:32:08.890 --> 00:32:11.220
So I thought, OK, well, what
can I wear that's informal

00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:12.139
but that's still me?

00:32:12.139 --> 00:32:14.180
You know, still it's got
a little bit of an edge,

00:32:14.180 --> 00:32:15.550
little bit stylish,
because I'm not

00:32:15.550 --> 00:32:17.424
going to come in here
in jeans and a T-shirt,

00:32:17.424 --> 00:32:19.520
or even khakis and
a button-down shirt.

00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:21.030
That's not me.

00:32:21.030 --> 00:32:24.880
So I was glad to be able to
find something that I had,

00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:27.100
that I thought would work.

00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:29.320
So I'll leave that up to you.

00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:31.981
You can let me know whether
you think it works or not.

00:32:31.981 --> 00:32:32.480
But--

00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:33.120
AUDIENCE: It's working.

00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:34.244
RUTH SHERMAN: It's working?

00:32:34.244 --> 00:32:36.050
Thank you. [LAUGHS] Thank you.

00:32:36.050 --> 00:32:37.390
I'm glad about that.

00:32:37.390 --> 00:32:40.100
But the whole idea
that we think,

00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:45.610
oh, we get up in the morning, in
Silicon Valley, that you think,

00:32:45.610 --> 00:32:48.090
oh gosh, I don't have to
worry about any of that stuff,

00:32:48.090 --> 00:32:49.990
because what you're
communicating,

00:32:49.990 --> 00:32:52.390
of course, is this
is not important.

00:32:52.390 --> 00:32:54.140
This isn't important.

00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:55.780
This is important.

00:32:55.780 --> 00:32:57.450
But guess what?

00:32:57.450 --> 00:33:02.760
A long time ago, somebody
chose this uniform for you.

00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:04.120
Somebody chose it.

00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:07.420
And it, in fact,
communicates something.

00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:11.050
You cannot get away from
communicating, regardless,

00:33:11.050 --> 00:33:13.615
whether you think you are,
or you think you aren't.

00:33:19.420 --> 00:33:22.647
One more thing about
presentation skills

00:33:22.647 --> 00:33:23.480
and public speaking.

00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:27.640
In order to get good at it,
you have got to practice.

00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:30.550
You've got to practice, and
you have to say it out loud.

00:33:30.550 --> 00:33:33.000
In your head does not count.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.930
We're all very eloquent
in our own heads.

00:33:35.930 --> 00:33:36.540
We are.

00:33:36.540 --> 00:33:39.000
We imagine ourselves getting
up on a stage or platform,

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:42.070
or conducting that meeting,
and being wonderful.

00:33:42.070 --> 00:33:44.010
It doesn't work that way.

00:33:44.010 --> 00:33:46.300
If you practice, say
it out loud a lot,

00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:48.660
and then you get
to the other side,

00:33:48.660 --> 00:33:50.690
where you can get up
there, and maybe you're

00:33:50.690 --> 00:33:51.972
nervous to begin with.

00:33:51.972 --> 00:33:54.180
And by the way, I don't call
it stage fright anymore.

00:33:54.180 --> 00:33:55.325
I just saw this.

00:33:55.325 --> 00:33:57.421
Call it stage appreciation.

00:33:57.421 --> 00:33:57.920
OK?

00:33:57.920 --> 00:33:58.920
Think about it that way.

00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:01.245
It's a re-frame of that feeling.

00:34:01.245 --> 00:34:02.870
But the idea that
you might be nervous,

00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:05.161
and you get up on a stage,
and you're worried about it,

00:34:05.161 --> 00:34:07.670
if you've practiced,
I guarantee you

00:34:07.670 --> 00:34:11.287
that once you start
speaking, it will dissipate.

00:34:11.287 --> 00:34:13.120
And you'll be able to
be yourself and go off

00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:15.360
the reservation, go off
your prepared remarks

00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:18.530
and get back on again
much more easily.

00:34:18.530 --> 00:34:19.480
So practice.

00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:23.230
Practice plus experience
equal spontaneity.

00:34:23.230 --> 00:34:25.750
Let's move on to message.

00:34:25.750 --> 00:34:28.179
And then we're going to talk
about the personal narrative.

00:34:28.179 --> 00:34:30.512
We're not going to spend as
much time on either of those

00:34:30.512 --> 00:34:33.070
as we did on the presentation
skills and public speaking.

00:34:33.070 --> 00:34:35.040
And then we'll leave
enough time for questions,

00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:36.929
because I'd love to hear
what you have to say,

00:34:36.929 --> 00:34:38.095
and what your questions are.

00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:42.699
All right. #AllinForJeb.

00:34:42.699 --> 00:34:47.199
This is Jeb Bush's current--
that was on his website a month

00:34:47.199 --> 00:34:48.719
or so ago.

00:34:48.719 --> 00:34:55.000
I understand that
he has a new logo,

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.860
and I didn't see it on his
website, called Jeb Can Fix It.

00:34:57.860 --> 00:34:59.500
And I'm thinking, fix what?

00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:01.030
Fix himself?

00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:02.570
Fix his presentation?

00:35:02.570 --> 00:35:04.490
Fix his failing campaign?

00:35:04.490 --> 00:35:06.080
What is Jeb going to fix?

00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:07.440
Jeb can fix it.

00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:08.460
Interesting.

00:35:08.460 --> 00:35:09.620
Yeah?

00:35:09.620 --> 00:35:10.210
All right.

00:35:10.210 --> 00:35:11.170
Let's see.

00:35:11.170 --> 00:35:11.900
Who else?

00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:15.080
Who knows Carly
Fiorina's-- this is a test.

00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:18.590
Who knows Carly
Fiorina's slogan?

00:35:18.590 --> 00:35:19.561
Anybody?

00:35:19.561 --> 00:35:20.060
Right.

00:35:20.060 --> 00:35:20.380
Pardon me?

00:35:20.380 --> 00:35:20.850
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:20.850 --> 00:35:21.433
What was that?

00:35:21.433 --> 00:35:23.200
I didn't hear it.

00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:23.720
What was it?

00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:24.219
Tell me.

00:35:24.219 --> 00:35:26.530
AUDIENCE: I said,
HP wasn't that bad.

00:35:26.530 --> 00:35:29.220
RUTH SHERMAN: [LAUGHS] Probably.

00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:29.720
All right.

00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:30.480
So Carly Fiorina.

00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:32.070
What about Ben Carson.

00:35:32.070 --> 00:35:34.592
Anybody know Ben
Carson's slogan?

00:35:34.592 --> 00:35:37.035
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:37.035 --> 00:35:37.910
RUTH SHERMAN: Pardon?

00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:38.780
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:38.780 --> 00:35:40.259
RUTH SHERMAN: What was that?

00:35:40.259 --> 00:35:41.738
AUDIENCE: I said, [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:41.738 --> 00:35:46.240
RUTH SHERMAN: [LAUGHS]
What about, who else?

00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:47.590
Marco Rubio.

00:35:47.590 --> 00:35:49.650
Anybody know his slogan?

00:35:49.650 --> 00:35:50.350
No, right?

00:35:50.350 --> 00:35:52.040
Hillary Clinton?

00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:53.280
Nope.

00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:54.025
Nope.

00:35:54.025 --> 00:35:54.650
Bernie Sanders?

00:35:58.260 --> 00:36:00.490
Do you know Donald Trump's?

00:36:00.490 --> 00:36:02.352
What's Donald Trump's?

00:36:02.352 --> 00:36:03.810
AUDIENCE: Make
America Great Again.

00:36:03.810 --> 00:36:05.975
RUTH SHERMAN: Make
America Great Again.

00:36:05.975 --> 00:36:07.850
We're going to come back
to that in a minute.

00:36:07.850 --> 00:36:10.060
There's a reason that you
know Donald Trump's and you

00:36:10.060 --> 00:36:11.230
don't know the others.

00:36:11.230 --> 00:36:12.870
There's a reason.

00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:13.370
All right.

00:36:13.370 --> 00:36:14.420
All In For Jeb.

00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:16.762
Let's see what else
we've got here.

00:36:16.762 --> 00:36:17.670
Not bad.

00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:18.540
New Possibilities.

00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:19.470
Real Leadership.

00:36:19.470 --> 00:36:20.350
Not bad.

00:36:20.350 --> 00:36:22.310
It's OK.

00:36:22.310 --> 00:36:26.520
It says a bit about who she
is, and real leadership,

00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:30.990
she's going back to
her leadership of HP.

00:36:30.990 --> 00:36:32.840
This one scares me.

00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:33.380
Honestly.

00:36:33.380 --> 00:36:33.680
Heal.

00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:34.220
Inspire.

00:36:34.220 --> 00:36:35.170
Revive.

00:36:35.170 --> 00:36:36.930
Yes, you've got to
revive yourself.

00:36:36.930 --> 00:36:40.950
You know, you
better-- It's like,

00:36:40.950 --> 00:36:42.380
the first two I don't mind.

00:36:42.380 --> 00:36:44.510
The heal, inspire, I like those.

00:36:44.510 --> 00:36:48.410
But then revive
is from the dead?

00:36:48.410 --> 00:36:49.312
What?

00:36:49.312 --> 00:36:49.811
You know?

00:36:49.811 --> 00:36:51.920
What?

00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:52.540
All right.

00:36:52.540 --> 00:36:54.920
Are You Ready For A
New American Century?

00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:58.270
He had just A New
American Century.

00:36:58.270 --> 00:37:00.830
I just picked this up a couple
of days ago, so he's added.

00:37:00.830 --> 00:37:01.740
He's testing.

00:37:01.740 --> 00:37:06.320
Or he's using it as a sentence,
a question, in this case.

00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:07.780
Are you ready for?

00:37:07.780 --> 00:37:10.110
I like A New American Century.

00:37:10.110 --> 00:37:11.850
I think that it's good.

00:37:11.850 --> 00:37:12.890
It's inspirational.

00:37:12.890 --> 00:37:14.870
There's something
interesting about it,

00:37:14.870 --> 00:37:16.460
and it rolls off the tongue.

00:37:18.974 --> 00:37:21.140
Hillary doesn't have a
slogan, but she's got a logo.

00:37:21.140 --> 00:37:23.310
When I first saw this,
I'm thinking, what?

00:37:23.310 --> 00:37:24.680
What?

00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:27.470
And, you know, it's
pointing to the right.

00:37:27.470 --> 00:37:28.950
And then it grew on me.

00:37:28.950 --> 00:37:31.160
I started to look at it,
and I thought, it's modern,

00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:34.080
it's clean, a lot
can be done with it.

00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:40.150
You can put the LGBT,
rainbow colors on it,

00:37:40.150 --> 00:37:43.956
and you can also do
something like this.

00:37:43.956 --> 00:37:45.252
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:45.252 --> 00:37:46.960
You know people will do that.

00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:50.510
That's the problem with logos.

00:37:50.510 --> 00:37:52.840
Not only your fans
can do things with it,

00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:56.540
but the opposition can
also do things with it.

00:37:56.540 --> 00:38:00.060
And then, of course, we've
got Make America Great

00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:03.040
Again, which you
many of you knew.

00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:04.990
So let's just break that down.

00:38:04.990 --> 00:38:06.970
What is a slogan?

00:38:06.970 --> 00:38:10.330
A slogan is a
combination of words

00:38:10.330 --> 00:38:16.210
that is framed in a way that
has an emotional impact.

00:38:16.210 --> 00:38:19.350
Framing is a way of
inserting a point of view

00:38:19.350 --> 00:38:22.120
into one word or a few words.

00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:25.450
And we want to keep
an economy of words,

00:38:25.450 --> 00:38:28.700
but it's not ultimately
necessary, always necessary,

00:38:28.700 --> 00:38:31.110
for it to be a very few words.

00:38:31.110 --> 00:38:34.080
My favorite one-word
frame right now

00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:37.130
is Democrat as an adjective.

00:38:37.130 --> 00:38:41.440
Democrat congress, Democrat
president, Democrat idea,

00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:43.290
as opposed to "democratic."

00:38:43.290 --> 00:38:46.340
That's a very interesting frame.

00:38:46.340 --> 00:38:47.780
Make America Great Again.

00:38:47.780 --> 00:38:50.810
This is what I call a
"God Damn It" statement.

00:38:50.810 --> 00:38:52.790
It's a God Damn It statement.

00:38:52.790 --> 00:38:56.510
So let's do an
analysis of the words.

00:38:56.510 --> 00:38:57.971
Make-- it's a command.

00:38:57.971 --> 00:38:58.470
Right?

00:38:58.470 --> 00:38:58.930
Make.

00:38:58.930 --> 00:38:59.770
We're going to make.

00:38:59.770 --> 00:39:02.010
I'll make, you make, we make.

00:39:02.010 --> 00:39:05.910
America-- self-explanatory,
the country, our great country.

00:39:05.910 --> 00:39:09.810
Great-- great, everybody
thinks of America as great,

00:39:09.810 --> 00:39:12.400
or we want to think
of America as great.

00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:15.020
Not everybody does, but
we want to, we hope to,

00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:16.460
we aspire to that.

00:39:16.460 --> 00:39:19.170
And then, Again-- ah,
that's the key word.

00:39:19.170 --> 00:39:20.480
That's the key word, "again."

00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:22.580
America was great once.

00:39:22.580 --> 00:39:24.440
It isn't any more.

00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:28.620
And go with Donald Trump,
it'll be great again.

00:39:28.620 --> 00:39:31.330
Stick with me, and
it will happen again.

00:39:31.330 --> 00:39:32.680
So this is a frame.

00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:33.290
It's a frame.

00:39:33.290 --> 00:39:36.600
The other thing that
happens with this slogan

00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:39.200
is the way the word
endings and beginnings are.

00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:42.210
So "make America--" ck ah.

00:39:42.210 --> 00:39:45.020
So the end of "make"
is a "ck" sound.

00:39:45.020 --> 00:39:47.020
And then America
is a vowel, right?

00:39:47.020 --> 00:39:49.490
It's a short "a."

00:39:49.490 --> 00:39:51.760
So "make America" flows.

00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:54.010
"Great." "Make America great."

00:39:54.010 --> 00:39:58.480
Eh, that's a little bit
different, not as smooth.

00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:00.380
But "great again."

00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:01.460
So it flows.

00:40:01.460 --> 00:40:04.560
It rolls off the
tongue really easily.

00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:06.880
So this is what Trump does.

00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:09.050
And he does it very, very well.

00:40:09.050 --> 00:40:14.240
And the other thing that
he does, is he keeps it,

00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:16.190
he repeats it all the time.

00:40:16.190 --> 00:40:17.950
This is called
"message discipline."

00:40:17.950 --> 00:40:18.900
It's on his hat.

00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:21.970
He does it on his Insta.

00:40:21.970 --> 00:40:23.540
Anybody connected
with his Instagram?

00:40:23.540 --> 00:40:25.206
Do you follow him on Insta?

00:40:25.206 --> 00:40:26.769
Oh, he's amazing.

00:40:26.769 --> 00:40:27.310
Just amazing.

00:40:27.310 --> 00:40:30.770
He blows me away as a
media-- he's media expert.

00:40:30.770 --> 00:40:34.650
He's a genius at keeping
himself in the public eye,

00:40:34.650 --> 00:40:37.320
on the front page, getting ink.

00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:40.000
In fact, the journalists
I talk to complain

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:43.800
that because media is so
corporate at this point,

00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:47.250
they keep Donald Trump in the
news because it sells papers,

00:40:47.250 --> 00:40:49.070
and it sells advertising time.

00:40:49.070 --> 00:40:53.612
This is a sad but true thing
about our media industry.

00:40:53.612 --> 00:40:54.820
They should be protecting us.

00:40:54.820 --> 00:40:56.528
I don't think they're
doing as good a job

00:40:56.528 --> 00:40:57.920
as they should with this.

00:40:57.920 --> 00:41:00.030
So "Make America Great
Again," a God Damn It

00:41:00.030 --> 00:41:04.530
statement that rolls off
the tongue really easily.

00:41:04.530 --> 00:41:07.280
As I was talking about earlier,
a great one-word frame now,

00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:08.840
Democrat.

00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:12.340
Some Republican message
mavens, Frank Luntz.

00:41:12.340 --> 00:41:14.780
Anybody know who Frank Luntz is?

00:41:14.780 --> 00:41:22.100
He's a wonderful, smart,
language-- he's a sociologist,

00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:24.660
I believe, but he does
a lot of the polling.

00:41:24.660 --> 00:41:27.060
He's a pollster for
the Republicans.

00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:28.260
He has a book.

00:41:28.260 --> 00:41:29.530
You should get this book.

00:41:29.530 --> 00:41:31.380
It's called "Words That Work."

00:41:31.380 --> 00:41:35.370
It's not what you say,
it's what people hear.

00:41:35.370 --> 00:41:37.150
Not what you say,
it's what people hear.

00:41:37.150 --> 00:41:39.295
It's all about framing
and using advertising,

00:41:39.295 --> 00:41:41.940
and he's created a lot
of different frames.

00:41:41.940 --> 00:41:44.980
So think about these
frames and politics.

00:41:44.980 --> 00:41:50.390
Tax cuts, or tax relief?

00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:51.160
Tax cuts?

00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:52.240
Tax relief?

00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:54.870
Tax cuts, eh, we hear
that all the time.

00:41:54.870 --> 00:42:01.130
Tax relief implies that
there's oppression.

00:42:01.130 --> 00:42:03.700
There's oppression, and there's
been a bad guy, a villain,

00:42:03.700 --> 00:42:05.283
and then somebody
rides to the rescue,

00:42:05.283 --> 00:42:09.300
and lifts the pressure off of
you, and your taxes go down,

00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:11.960
and everybody's
happily ever after.

00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:12.640
All right.

00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:16.170
Another one-- drilling for
oil, or energy exploration?

00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:21.760
Which can you get behind?

00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:23.380
They're the same thing.

00:42:23.380 --> 00:42:26.430
They're the same thing.

00:42:26.430 --> 00:42:27.370
Here's another one.

00:42:27.370 --> 00:42:30.600
Estate tax, or death tax?

00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:32.790
[GASPING] Right?

00:42:32.790 --> 00:42:34.910
Not only do I have to
pay taxes when I'm alive.

00:42:34.910 --> 00:42:36.890
When I die, they
take more taxes.

00:42:36.890 --> 00:42:38.410
It's like, ugh!

00:42:38.410 --> 00:42:39.260
Right?

00:42:39.260 --> 00:42:39.774
Estates?

00:42:39.774 --> 00:42:40.690
That's from Greenwich.

00:42:40.690 --> 00:42:42.480
That's where I live, in
Greenwich, Connecticut.

00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:44.688
You know, that's where the
estates-- and around here.

00:42:44.688 --> 00:42:48.060
That's really the estates are.

00:42:48.060 --> 00:42:53.030
As I mentioned,
Democrat as a one-word

00:42:53.030 --> 00:42:55.700
frame that you
hear more and more.

00:42:55.700 --> 00:42:57.520
A new frame that
I've heard, as they

00:42:57.520 --> 00:43:01.030
talk about the Affordable
Care Act, Obamacare,

00:43:01.030 --> 00:43:04.380
they talk about
entanglement in Obamacare.

00:43:04.380 --> 00:43:06.440
Entanglement is
never a good thing.

00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:08.040
That's what our banks do to us.

00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:09.120
They entangle us, right?

00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:11.370
We've got our credit card
with them, our checking,

00:43:11.370 --> 00:43:15.650
our savings, our
investments, whatever it is.

00:43:15.650 --> 00:43:18.250
And what ends up happening is,
if you want to change banks,

00:43:18.250 --> 00:43:20.860
you kind of go through
a lot of stuff to do it.

00:43:20.860 --> 00:43:22.360
It's called being entangled.

00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:26.440
They're talking about the
ACA now as entanglement.

00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:28.840
Very interesting.

00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:31.140
Business frames.

00:43:31.140 --> 00:43:34.010
Why do I want a grande when
a medium is the same thing,

00:43:34.010 --> 00:43:35.881
and cheaper?

00:43:35.881 --> 00:43:37.430
Why do I want that?

00:43:37.430 --> 00:43:38.760
Because it's a grande.

00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:44.230
And it get served by a barrista,
versus a coffee server,

00:43:44.230 --> 00:43:45.970
or a counter person.

00:43:45.970 --> 00:43:49.360
A counter person serves tepid
coffee in a chipped porcelain

00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:50.040
cup.

00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:54.090
A barrista serves
delicious, fair-trade coffee

00:43:54.090 --> 00:43:59.610
in a cool Christmas cup, to
stay with the time, right?

00:43:59.610 --> 00:44:00.640
Stick with the times.

00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:03.350
A red cup, a Christmasy
cup, a holiday cup.

00:44:03.350 --> 00:44:05.750
And there's Wi-Fi.

00:44:05.750 --> 00:44:06.880
It's a frame.

00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:09.180
It's a frame.

00:44:09.180 --> 00:44:09.900
The other thing.

00:44:09.900 --> 00:44:10.400
Let's see.

00:44:14.220 --> 00:44:17.150
There was one more that I
wanted to make sure-- Oh!

00:44:17.150 --> 00:44:20.900
Gambling, or gaming?

00:44:20.900 --> 00:44:22.050
Gambling?

00:44:22.050 --> 00:44:22.790
Sinful.

00:44:22.790 --> 00:44:23.290
Gaming?

00:44:23.290 --> 00:44:24.730
Fun.

00:44:24.730 --> 00:44:25.450
Right?

00:44:25.450 --> 00:44:28.710
So it's very fascinating
what people do about this.

00:44:28.710 --> 00:44:30.370
And so you can use it, too.

00:44:30.370 --> 00:44:36.580
You can absolutely
use frames as you're

00:44:36.580 --> 00:44:40.720
presenting your ideas in your
meetings to your higher-ups,

00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:42.000
to your colleagues.

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:43.660
Think about what's
in it for them.

00:44:43.660 --> 00:44:45.420
What is it about the frame?

00:44:45.420 --> 00:44:48.220
What is the aspirational
piece of that?

00:44:48.220 --> 00:44:50.460
Because that's what
a good frame does.

00:44:50.460 --> 00:44:52.400
It makes you feel good.

00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:53.860
It makes you feel better.

00:44:53.860 --> 00:44:56.234
It makes you think that your
life is going to be better,

00:44:56.234 --> 00:44:57.650
or your work, or
your business, is

00:44:57.650 --> 00:45:01.160
going to be easier, if you do
what it is that you're saying,

00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:02.760
if you framed it the right way.

00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:04.300
So start thinking about that.

00:45:04.300 --> 00:45:07.110
And start thinking about,
also, the message discipline.

00:45:07.110 --> 00:45:09.870
Repeating it over and
over and over again.

00:45:09.870 --> 00:45:13.012
We want it to be aspirational,
and you want to repeat it.

00:45:13.012 --> 00:45:14.720
By the way, test it,
and you'll see this.

00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:19.350
Just like we saw with Marco
Rubio's-- I think it was this

00:45:19.350 --> 00:45:20.195
last one.

00:45:20.195 --> 00:45:21.570
Nope, that was
"I'm with stupid."

00:45:21.570 --> 00:45:22.390
Sorry.

00:45:22.390 --> 00:45:24.590
Here we go.

00:45:24.590 --> 00:45:28.260
You know, with Rubio, he's
testing this new piece of it.

00:45:28.260 --> 00:45:30.300
He's putting it into a question.

00:45:30.300 --> 00:45:32.570
But before, it was just
"A New American Century."

00:45:32.570 --> 00:45:33.250
He's testing it.

00:45:33.250 --> 00:45:33.750
We'll see.

00:45:33.750 --> 00:45:36.050
So they test things,
just like we do,

00:45:36.050 --> 00:45:38.820
just like you do, in
business to see what works.

00:45:42.020 --> 00:45:42.730
All right.

00:45:42.730 --> 00:45:46.660
Let's go to the
personal narrative.

00:45:46.660 --> 00:45:48.320
AUDIENCE: One other
thing. [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:53.765
slogan [INAUDIBLE] you see that
first each time to advertise

00:45:53.765 --> 00:45:58.528
[INAUDIBLE] who think that
America's not great any more,

00:45:58.528 --> 00:46:02.336
and then, once he does
that, [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:02.336 --> 00:46:08.026
And these two parts
combine [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:08.026 --> 00:46:09.479
message that I've seen here.

00:46:09.479 --> 00:46:10.520
RUTH SHERMAN: Absolutely.

00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:14.010
It's a simple frame, but I
think, you know, it's not new.

00:46:14.010 --> 00:46:16.110
It's not a new
combination of words.

00:46:16.110 --> 00:46:18.640
In fact, it was used around
the Reagan Administration.

00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:21.520
They framed it, or when Ronald
Reagan was running for office.

00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:24.230
There are only so many
words, simple words,

00:46:24.230 --> 00:46:28.630
and simple declarative
statements, that exists,

00:46:28.630 --> 00:46:32.100
that will work in
these contexts.

00:46:32.100 --> 00:46:34.690
But I think it's his discipline.

00:46:34.690 --> 00:46:36.870
He found an excellent
combination of words.

00:46:36.870 --> 00:46:38.350
This was not an accident.

00:46:38.350 --> 00:46:40.450
It was a good frame.

00:46:40.450 --> 00:46:42.600
And he repeats it ad infinitum.

00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:44.220
He repeats it constantly.

00:46:44.220 --> 00:46:45.974
Let's see what I got here.

The hero journey that each
person in the world takes.

00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:11.200
Some people have a better
hero-journey story than others.

00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:15.030
Like Barack Obama had a
fantastic hero-journey story.

00:48:15.030 --> 00:48:18.240
But what happens if you've
been raised either wealthy,

00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:20.530
or middle class, you don't
have that much hardship,

00:48:20.530 --> 00:48:23.240
you haven't had to overcome
the same kinds of things

00:48:23.240 --> 00:48:27.200
that somebody like
Obama had to overcome.

00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:29.930
Or like Ben Carson now,
who's talking about what

00:48:29.930 --> 00:48:32.520
he's had to overcome.

00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:34.610
So what do you do about that?

00:48:34.610 --> 00:48:36.980
Well, it's another way
that we get to know people.

00:48:36.980 --> 00:48:39.900
One of the things that
I think is interesting,

00:48:39.900 --> 00:48:43.400
as we look at
Hillary Clinton, she

00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:46.250
was raised in a
middle-class family.

00:48:46.250 --> 00:48:48.650
Her father was a businessman.

00:48:48.650 --> 00:48:50.660
Her mother, she talks
about her mother

00:48:50.660 --> 00:48:52.320
having been thrown
out of the house,

00:48:52.320 --> 00:48:55.472
or having to leave
home at the age of 14

00:48:55.472 --> 00:48:56.430
and make it on her own.

00:48:56.430 --> 00:48:58.513
So she's talking about
that, but that hasn't quite

00:48:58.513 --> 00:49:00.750
connected with people yet.

00:49:00.750 --> 00:49:01.840
It hasn't quite connected.

00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:03.440
I don't know that it will.

00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:05.580
I think that there's
certain times when you just

00:49:05.580 --> 00:49:06.930
have to run on your resume.

00:49:06.930 --> 00:49:09.830
And I think that's what she
will end up doing, in terms

00:49:09.830 --> 00:49:12.170
of telling her story,
in how she came up,

00:49:12.170 --> 00:49:15.670
and how she came up through
the women's movement,

00:49:15.670 --> 00:49:17.665
and became a professional
lawyer, and a partner

00:49:17.665 --> 00:49:24.780
in a firm, and all of her work
for girls and women, et cetera.

00:49:24.780 --> 00:49:29.830
And her resume is very
lengthy and quite impressive.

00:49:29.830 --> 00:49:33.575
Carly Fiorina, from
secretary to CEO.

00:49:33.575 --> 00:49:35.370
A little alliteration there.

00:49:35.370 --> 00:49:37.340
And we can make fun
of her, and think,

00:49:37.340 --> 00:49:39.362
like, she also was raised
in the middle class

00:49:39.362 --> 00:49:40.570
or upper middle class family.

00:49:40.570 --> 00:49:43.400
I don't think she had
much hardship growing up.

00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:45.750
But the idea that
she was a secretary.

00:49:45.750 --> 00:49:48.320
You know, she and I
are about the same age.

00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:52.570
She-- When I started
working, I was a receptionist

00:49:52.570 --> 00:49:54.470
in an accounting
firm in New York.

00:49:54.470 --> 00:49:55.612
I couldn't get a job.

00:49:55.612 --> 00:49:56.570
I wasn't an accountant.

00:49:56.570 --> 00:49:58.750
But I wouldn't have been
able to get a job like you,

00:49:58.750 --> 00:50:01.450
like all of the women now,
who graduate college and get

00:50:01.450 --> 00:50:03.800
real jobs, real
professional jobs.

00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:05.880
It's an amazing transformation.

00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:08.142
I sometimes think the
women's movement is stalled,

00:50:08.142 --> 00:50:10.100
but then I come to places
like this, in Google,

00:50:10.100 --> 00:50:12.250
and Accenture yesterday,
and I think, thank

00:50:12.250 --> 00:50:16.100
god, it hasn't stalled.

00:50:16.100 --> 00:50:17.370
It is much better.

00:50:17.370 --> 00:50:18.590
It feels glacial.

00:50:18.590 --> 00:50:21.630
But that's going to be
Carly Fiorina's frame.

00:50:21.630 --> 00:50:24.470
Donald Trump has a frame story.

00:50:24.470 --> 00:50:27.620
Donald Trump has a problem
talking about his life.

00:50:27.620 --> 00:50:30.000
He came from a wealthy family.

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:31.500
His father was a developer.

00:50:31.500 --> 00:50:34.290
He's mentioned one
thing about his--

00:50:34.290 --> 00:50:39.980
had a brother who died
unexpectedly, or too young,

00:50:39.980 --> 00:50:41.260
I think from alcoholism.

00:50:41.260 --> 00:50:42.094
I think that was it.

00:50:42.094 --> 00:50:43.510
But he doesn't
talk about it much,

00:50:43.510 --> 00:50:45.160
so we don't really
know much about him.

00:50:45.160 --> 00:50:47.700
But we don't really care,
because Donald Trump isn't

00:50:47.700 --> 00:50:50.200
expected to be introspective.

00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:51.252
So it's consistent.

00:50:51.252 --> 00:50:51.960
It's interesting.

00:50:51.960 --> 00:50:53.990
It's consistent with his brand.

00:50:53.990 --> 00:50:59.260
Bernie Sanders has the story
of he's been in politics now

00:50:59.260 --> 00:51:02.010
for 25 or 30 years,
I think about, yeah,

00:51:02.010 --> 00:51:04.740
about 25 or 30 years,
so he can't go back

00:51:04.740 --> 00:51:07.140
and say, well I'm
sort of an outsider.

00:51:07.140 --> 00:51:08.280
He's not.

00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:08.970
But what is it?

00:51:08.970 --> 00:51:11.410
He comes from a small state.

00:51:11.410 --> 00:51:14.350
What is it that Bernie Sanders
can bring to the table?

00:51:14.350 --> 00:51:16.500
He's a father, I think,
of four children,

00:51:16.500 --> 00:51:18.130
a grandfather of seven.

00:51:18.130 --> 00:51:20.020
He talks about that
a lot, so that people

00:51:20.020 --> 00:51:22.640
can relate to him in that way.

00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:25.250
Ben Carson, we know his
story, and now they're

00:51:25.250 --> 00:51:26.670
starting to pick
on him about it.

00:51:26.670 --> 00:51:29.170
I don't know whether any of its
true, whether it's not true.

00:51:29.170 --> 00:51:30.190
I don't have any idea.

00:51:30.190 --> 00:51:33.980
But it's compelling stuff,
if you think about it.

00:51:33.980 --> 00:51:35.770
One of the most
interesting things,

00:51:35.770 --> 00:51:39.066
as I was following
politics in the-- I

00:51:39.066 --> 00:51:44.236
remember when George Bush was
running against John Kerry.

00:51:44.236 --> 00:51:47.280
Now George Bush is from
one of the first families

00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:48.650
of American politics.

00:51:48.650 --> 00:51:49.910
The Bush family.

00:51:49.910 --> 00:51:51.510
Been in politics.

00:51:51.510 --> 00:51:52.490
Wealthy New Englanders.

00:51:52.490 --> 00:51:55.920
And then in Texas, oil
business, for decades.

00:51:58.810 --> 00:52:01.290
So George Bush was running
against John Kerry.

00:52:01.290 --> 00:52:04.570
John Kerry got the reputation
as being the patrician.

00:52:04.570 --> 00:52:07.970
George Bush, his story
was, his narrative

00:52:07.970 --> 00:52:10.800
was that he would be
filmed on his ranch,

00:52:10.800 --> 00:52:14.080
clearing brush in his
flannel shirt and his jeans,

00:52:14.080 --> 00:52:16.900
and his cowboy boots
and his cowboy hat,

00:52:16.900 --> 00:52:21.630
and his dogs in tow, and in
his dusty pickup truck, right?

00:52:21.630 --> 00:52:22.300
Clearing brush.

00:52:22.300 --> 00:52:25.070
That's what he was always
doing on his weekends.

00:52:25.070 --> 00:52:28.590
John Kerry was
windsurfing off Nantucket.

00:52:28.590 --> 00:52:31.690
You don't do that if you
want to run for President,

00:52:31.690 --> 00:52:34.140
and you want people to think
that you're not the patrician

00:52:34.140 --> 00:52:34.770
one.

00:52:34.770 --> 00:52:37.640
So their personal narrative
is going to be very important.

00:52:37.640 --> 00:52:38.980
They're going to flesh this out.

00:52:38.980 --> 00:52:42.430
It's going to come up,
and we're going to see it.

00:52:42.430 --> 00:52:47.070
For you, in business, you
don't want to get too personal.

00:52:47.070 --> 00:52:49.650
Not in a large group.

00:52:49.650 --> 00:52:51.280
Certainly not.

00:52:51.280 --> 00:52:53.530
With your colleagues, close
colleagues, and people

00:52:53.530 --> 00:52:55.160
you have good
relationships with, yes.

00:52:55.160 --> 00:52:57.060
You can tell them some
of your struggles.

00:52:57.060 --> 00:53:01.080
But in business,
leaders that I work with

00:53:01.080 --> 00:53:03.109
are always advised
to find something

00:53:03.109 --> 00:53:05.150
that they can talk about
where it didn't work out

00:53:05.150 --> 00:53:06.410
so well for them.

00:53:06.410 --> 00:53:09.550
Where they failed, and how they
struggled with that failure,

00:53:09.550 --> 00:53:12.230
and how they fixed
it and came back.

00:53:12.230 --> 00:53:14.510
Whether it was they
were fired, or they

00:53:14.510 --> 00:53:18.220
failed on a big project, or
something of that nature,

00:53:18.220 --> 00:53:20.460
that makes them seem more human.

00:53:20.460 --> 00:53:22.620
People will connect
with you if they

00:53:22.620 --> 00:53:25.230
think, like I said at the
outset, when I was introducing

00:53:25.230 --> 00:53:28.600
this, if they think that you
are a human being who can relate

00:53:28.600 --> 00:53:31.420
to them, who gets
them, who knows

00:53:31.420 --> 00:53:35.810
what the cost of an evening
out for dinner would be.

00:53:35.810 --> 00:53:41.240
Who knows what the cost of a
roll of toilet paper would be.

00:53:41.240 --> 00:53:44.160
So I want to close
by telling you

00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:52.880
that it doesn't matter whether
you think you are good at this,

00:53:52.880 --> 00:53:54.180
or you think you're not.

00:53:54.180 --> 00:53:55.880
These are skills
that can be learned.

00:53:55.880 --> 00:53:57.550
This is not inborn.

00:53:57.550 --> 00:53:59.940
These are concrete skills
that can be learned.

00:53:59.940 --> 00:54:03.790
I would imagine that Google
has all kinds of workshops.

00:54:03.790 --> 00:54:07.080
If you need to go
a little further,

00:54:07.080 --> 00:54:09.850
there's the National
Speakers Association.

00:54:09.850 --> 00:54:11.500
And they have a San
Francisco chapter.

00:54:11.500 --> 00:54:13.870
If you need to go further,
but closer to home,

00:54:13.870 --> 00:54:15.940
look for your
Toastmasters chapter,

00:54:15.940 --> 00:54:18.320
or somebody start
one here at Google,

00:54:18.320 --> 00:54:20.270
if you don't already have one.

00:54:20.270 --> 00:54:20.910
You have one.

00:54:20.910 --> 00:54:21.410
Yeah.

00:54:21.410 --> 00:54:22.970
You have probably
several, right?

00:54:22.970 --> 00:54:24.270
Several chapters?

00:54:24.270 --> 00:54:24.780
Yeah?

00:54:24.780 --> 00:54:25.280
OK.

00:54:25.280 --> 00:54:26.010
Not a surprise.

00:54:26.010 --> 00:54:26.510
Go!

00:54:26.510 --> 00:54:27.390
Do this stuff.

00:54:27.390 --> 00:54:28.730
Get better at this.

00:54:28.730 --> 00:54:30.650
Get some objective feedback.

00:54:30.650 --> 00:54:33.620
Because it will
advance your career.

00:54:33.620 --> 00:54:35.120
Because here's the
truth-- no matter

00:54:35.120 --> 00:54:39.210
how much experience you
have, how long you've

00:54:39.210 --> 00:54:42.650
been in business, how
much you love what you do,

00:54:42.650 --> 00:54:46.560
and critically,
how smart you are,

00:54:46.560 --> 00:54:49.809
if you don't have a
commanding presence, if you

00:54:49.809 --> 00:54:52.350
don't know how to communicate,
you will continue to struggle.

00:54:52.350 --> 00:54:57.310
You'll continue to be
underpaid and under-recognized.

00:54:57.310 --> 00:54:59.540
And you'll continue
to labor to get

00:54:59.540 --> 00:55:04.380
the people to find you, and help
you, and promote you, and give

00:55:04.380 --> 00:55:07.340
you the bonuses and the
recognition you deserve.

00:55:07.340 --> 00:55:12.990
These are the skills that cure
all those ills more quickly

00:55:12.990 --> 00:55:13.840
than anything else.

00:55:13.840 --> 00:55:17.220
A colleague of mine calls
it a shortcut to sales.

00:55:17.220 --> 00:55:20.810
There are no shortcuts in life,
except communication and public

00:55:20.810 --> 00:55:22.330
speaking.

00:55:22.330 --> 00:55:23.310
Thank you very much.

00:55:23.310 --> 00:55:27.830
[APPLAUSE]

00:55:27.830 --> 00:55:29.920
What questions do you have?

00:55:29.920 --> 00:55:33.340
AUDIENCE: So I remember Barack
Obama being very articulate,

00:55:33.340 --> 00:55:35.630
having a sense of he was
really speaking to me,

00:55:35.630 --> 00:55:38.130
or he really has a message.

00:55:38.130 --> 00:55:40.770
And since he's
been President, it

00:55:40.770 --> 00:55:42.020
seems to me he's gotten worse.

00:55:42.020 --> 00:55:43.150
Do you think that's true?

00:55:43.150 --> 00:55:43.900
RUTH SHERMAN: Yes.

00:55:43.900 --> 00:55:44.480
He has.

00:55:44.480 --> 00:55:50.040
And I think that Obama was
a great reader of scripts.

00:55:50.040 --> 00:55:52.380
He's a great reader of
scripts on the teleprompter.

00:55:52.380 --> 00:55:53.891
He's not great off the cuff.

00:55:53.891 --> 00:55:55.890
I mean, he knows how to
memorize a stump speech,

00:55:55.890 --> 00:55:58.360
and he knows how to get out
there and engage an audience.

00:55:58.360 --> 00:56:01.491
But what ends up happening, and
this happens with all of them,

00:56:01.491 --> 00:56:01.990
by the way.

00:56:01.990 --> 00:56:03.240
It's not just Obama.

00:56:03.240 --> 00:56:04.650
We expected more
of him, I think,

00:56:04.650 --> 00:56:07.650
because he was so
wonderful as a speaker.

00:56:07.650 --> 00:56:10.070
Was so, like, whoa,
we'd been wandering

00:56:10.070 --> 00:56:13.170
in this desert of bad
communicators for too long.

00:56:13.170 --> 00:56:14.060
I had been.

00:56:14.060 --> 00:56:15.050
I don't know about you.

00:56:15.050 --> 00:56:17.240
I certainly had been.

00:56:17.240 --> 00:56:20.370
And then they do it
over and over again.

00:56:20.370 --> 00:56:21.450
It gets boring.

00:56:21.450 --> 00:56:23.950
It gets boring because
they don't do anything new.

00:56:23.950 --> 00:56:24.970
So--

00:56:24.970 --> 00:56:27.170
AUDIENCE: I think
a lot of us here,

00:56:27.170 --> 00:56:29.260
we don't give as many
presentations as you do,

00:56:29.260 --> 00:56:31.310
of course, or any of
these politicians.

00:56:31.310 --> 00:56:33.285
And then, at least,
what happens to me,

00:56:33.285 --> 00:56:36.060
and probably many of us here,
is that we, all of a sudden,

00:56:36.060 --> 00:56:39.472
are called upon by our manager--
hey, I want you to give a talk.

00:56:39.472 --> 00:56:41.180
Like this happened a
few weeks ago to me.

00:56:41.180 --> 00:56:44.330
All my managers said, would you
give a talk to these 200 people

00:56:44.330 --> 00:56:46.040
at this-- And like, oh, man.

00:56:46.040 --> 00:56:48.110
OK.

00:56:48.110 --> 00:56:50.230
How do you-- I'm out of
practice, so to speak.

00:56:50.230 --> 00:56:51.896
And like you said,
you need to practice.

00:56:51.896 --> 00:56:54.230
But then, we don't have
that many opportunities.

00:56:54.230 --> 00:56:56.484
So how do you get
practice without--

00:56:56.484 --> 00:56:58.900
so that you're ready for when
the moment comes, without --

00:56:58.900 --> 00:57:00.650
kind of like being a backup
quarterback, you know.

00:57:00.650 --> 00:57:01.990
RUTH SHERMAN: Totally get it.

00:57:01.990 --> 00:57:03.760
You get rusty, is
what you're saying.

00:57:03.760 --> 00:57:05.630
You get rusty.

00:57:05.630 --> 00:57:07.330
I get rusty, too.

00:57:07.330 --> 00:57:09.900
My practice for this
started six weeks ago.

00:57:09.900 --> 00:57:11.270
I've done this presentation.

00:57:11.270 --> 00:57:12.650
I'm a professional speaker.

00:57:12.650 --> 00:57:14.280
I speak all the time.

00:57:14.280 --> 00:57:16.000
But I started six weeks ago.

00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:19.490
I had notice, of course, and
started putting it together.

00:57:19.490 --> 00:57:21.779
Every four years it changes.

00:57:21.779 --> 00:57:23.320
And then, the last
couple of weeks, I

00:57:23.320 --> 00:57:24.860
said it out loud every day.

00:57:24.860 --> 00:57:25.360
Every day.

00:57:25.360 --> 00:57:26.734
Because when you
say it out loud,

00:57:26.734 --> 00:57:29.330
just-- And I know you don't
get that same kind of notice.

00:57:29.330 --> 00:57:31.637
I'd like to know how
much time you did have.

00:57:31.637 --> 00:57:32.470
AUDIENCE: Two weeks.

00:57:32.470 --> 00:57:33.180
RUTH SHERMAN: You had two weeks?

00:57:33.180 --> 00:57:33.440
OK.

00:57:33.440 --> 00:57:34.300
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:57:34.300 --> 00:57:35.008
RUTH SHERMAN: OK.

00:57:35.008 --> 00:57:35.946
It's not ideal.

00:57:35.946 --> 00:57:36.570
It's not ideal.

00:57:36.570 --> 00:57:37.430
But it's something.

00:57:37.430 --> 00:57:39.263
How long was the presentation?

00:57:39.263 --> 00:57:40.230
AUDIENCE: 15 minutes.

00:57:40.230 --> 00:57:41.110
RUTH SHERMAN: OK.

00:57:41.110 --> 00:57:47.880
So think of it-- So let me just
give you the words per minute

00:57:47.880 --> 00:57:48.900
calculation.

00:57:48.900 --> 00:57:51.960
We speak at about
140 words per minute.

00:57:51.960 --> 00:57:56.690
And a 15-minute talk, then,
just do the math on that.

00:57:56.690 --> 00:58:00.150
So like, 2,000 words,
or 1,500 words,

00:58:00.150 --> 00:58:01.520
something of that nature.

00:58:01.520 --> 00:58:03.630
And you're not going
to write it all out.

00:58:03.630 --> 00:58:05.960
But as you say it, you've
got to practice it.

00:58:05.960 --> 00:58:10.040
And you can use a speaker clock,
like I have, to time yourself.

00:58:10.040 --> 00:58:11.360
And you can use notes.

00:58:11.360 --> 00:58:13.730
I'm using notes
today, everybody.

00:58:13.730 --> 00:58:16.740
I'm looking at my
speaker's notes on here.

00:58:16.740 --> 00:58:19.350
There's no law against that.

00:58:19.350 --> 00:58:21.520
Are you allowed to
use notes, or slides?

00:58:21.520 --> 00:58:22.860
OK, good.

00:58:22.860 --> 00:58:23.470
So, yeah.

00:58:23.470 --> 00:58:24.730
Just use your notes.

00:58:24.730 --> 00:58:25.990
But practice enough.

00:58:25.990 --> 00:58:28.530
I mean, if you've got
a week to do this,

00:58:28.530 --> 00:58:30.840
then you're going to have
to get to work quickly.

00:58:30.840 --> 00:58:32.080
AUDIENCE: Practice by
yourself, you mean?

00:58:32.080 --> 00:58:32.450
RUTH SHERMAN: Yup.

00:58:32.450 --> 00:58:33.450
AUDIENCE: With a video camera?

00:58:33.450 --> 00:58:35.377
RUTH SHERMAN: You could
use a video camera,

00:58:35.377 --> 00:58:37.710
but if it's going to be too
much of a pain in the neck--

00:58:37.710 --> 00:58:38.760
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:58:38.760 --> 00:58:39.730
RUTH SHERMAN:
Yeah, well even so.

00:58:39.730 --> 00:58:40.420
Yeah.

00:58:40.420 --> 00:58:42.920
If it's going to be too much
of a pain in the neck to set it

00:58:42.920 --> 00:58:44.450
up and get that going.

00:58:44.450 --> 00:58:46.840
And if you're not going to
watch it, then don't bother.

00:58:46.840 --> 00:58:48.900
And that's the biggest thing.

00:58:48.900 --> 00:58:52.040
It's very painful to
watch yourself on video.

00:58:52.040 --> 00:58:54.870
It's like 100 times more
painful than listening to your

00:58:54.870 --> 00:58:57.110
voicemail. [LAUGHS] Right?

00:58:57.110 --> 00:58:59.245
It's terrible.

00:58:59.245 --> 00:59:00.870
And even my celebrity
clients are like,

00:59:00.870 --> 00:59:04.560
oh, god, don't show me-- It's
like, you gotta watch yourself.

00:59:04.560 --> 00:59:09.220
But if it's going to stop you
from practicing, don't bother.

00:59:09.220 --> 00:59:10.950
Don't bother.

00:59:10.950 --> 00:59:12.800
It's ideal if you
could do it that way,

00:59:12.800 --> 00:59:14.540
but only if you're
going to watch it.

00:59:14.540 --> 00:59:16.120
But saying it out
loud is the key.

00:59:16.120 --> 00:59:18.740
What you'll also find, and this
is something I didn't mention.

00:59:18.740 --> 00:59:22.180
When you say it out loud
enough, the speech centers

00:59:22.180 --> 00:59:23.740
in your brain are activated.

00:59:23.740 --> 00:59:27.350
And things that you didn't
even consider to say,

00:59:27.350 --> 00:59:29.030
like all kinds of
pithy things, come

00:59:29.030 --> 00:59:31.310
to mind that you
wouldn't have considered.

00:59:31.310 --> 00:59:33.476
So keep that in mind.

00:59:33.476 --> 00:59:35.100
So saying it out
loud, and you probably

00:59:35.100 --> 00:59:37.474
have to say it out loud every
day, probably several times

00:59:37.474 --> 00:59:38.070
a day.

00:59:38.070 --> 00:59:42.250
Another tip is to not always
start at the beginning.

00:59:42.250 --> 00:59:44.910
Because then, of course,
you get interrupted,

00:59:44.910 --> 00:59:47.010
and you put it down,
and then what happens?

00:59:47.010 --> 00:59:49.410
You come back, and you start
again at the beginning.

00:59:49.410 --> 00:59:50.690
And the beginning's great.

00:59:50.690 --> 00:59:52.850
And the middle and the end suck.

00:59:52.850 --> 00:59:53.880
They do.

00:59:53.880 --> 00:59:54.630
It's what happens.

00:59:54.630 --> 00:59:57.240
You have to start in the
middle sometimes, and take it

00:59:57.240 --> 01:00:01.300
to the end, or go over some
chunks that are troublesome.

01:00:01.300 --> 01:00:03.240
See how the words
roll off your tongue.

01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:07.084
AUDIENCE: One thing I've been
practicing-- [INAUDIBLE].

01:00:07.084 --> 01:00:10.200
I think one thing that I've
been practicing, after watching

01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:13.430
myself do this presentation,
which was, let's say,

01:00:13.430 --> 01:00:17.686
less than optimal, I realized
I speak really quickly.

01:00:17.686 --> 01:00:19.310
And then, now I'm
trying to actually do

01:00:19.310 --> 01:00:20.480
that in everyday life.

01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:24.000
And so, how do you apply your
techniques from presentations

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.460
that you give to hundreds
or thousands of people,

01:00:26.460 --> 01:00:31.352
to kind of groups of
one to three or four?

01:00:31.352 --> 01:00:32.810
RUTH SHERMAN: Well,
I will tell you

01:00:32.810 --> 01:00:36.590
that I also have the problem
of speaking too fast,

01:00:36.590 --> 01:00:39.600
and it's a constant tape that's
playing in the back of my head

01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:42.300
to modulate my rate.

01:00:42.300 --> 01:00:47.280
So I used to, on my notes, put
a big "slow down," slow down,

01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:48.270
on every page.

01:00:48.270 --> 01:00:50.770
And then it became wallpaper,
and I had to change the color,

01:00:50.770 --> 01:00:52.270
or change the-- right?

01:00:52.270 --> 01:00:54.490
You blank it out after a while.

01:00:54.490 --> 01:00:58.730
So I give myself some
kind of a tip, or helper,

01:00:58.730 --> 01:01:01.700
or some kind of a
cue, that enables

01:01:01.700 --> 01:01:04.200
me to pay attention to that.

01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:05.680
And then, after
you do it enough,

01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:11.610
and you see how slowing down
enables you to think better.

01:01:11.610 --> 01:01:15.370
It enables you to think better,
and come up, and then entertain

01:01:15.370 --> 01:01:17.960
questions, and not
get, perhaps, flustered

01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:20.270
if you make a mistake, or
you're reading the room,

01:01:20.270 --> 01:01:21.740
and things aren't
going that well.

01:01:21.740 --> 01:01:22.810
Or you think they're not.

01:01:22.810 --> 01:01:24.230
You imagine they're
not going well.

01:01:24.230 --> 01:01:26.605
I mean, just because people
aren't looking at you doesn't

01:01:26.605 --> 01:01:28.430
mean they're not going well.

01:01:28.430 --> 01:01:31.320
But those are some of
the things that I do,

01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:32.410
and that I've tried to do.

01:01:32.410 --> 01:01:34.490
And then, the more you do
it, the better you get.

01:01:34.490 --> 01:01:37.890
Which is another reason, I
think, to do it more regularly,

01:01:37.890 --> 01:01:41.750
and join a-- do
more Toastmasters.

01:01:41.750 --> 01:01:44.990
Have more opportunities,
and volunteer more

01:01:44.990 --> 01:01:45.860
for opportunities.

01:01:45.860 --> 01:01:47.260
If you're not, it's a pain.

01:01:47.260 --> 01:01:47.910
It's hard work.

01:01:47.910 --> 01:01:49.610
It's hard to get good at this.

01:01:49.610 --> 01:01:51.180
So that's another,
it's an addition.

01:01:51.180 --> 01:01:53.450
But then it's like
riding a bike.

01:01:53.450 --> 01:01:55.220
You get it, and you've
got it, and then

01:01:55.220 --> 01:01:59.220
you only have to, like we said
earlier, just, when you get

01:01:59.220 --> 01:02:00.930
rusty, and you just refresh.

01:02:00.930 --> 01:02:03.035
You refresh.

01:02:03.035 --> 01:02:04.910
AUDIENCE: I noticed,
started paying attention

01:02:04.910 --> 01:02:09.060
to your hand gestures
after you called them out.

01:02:09.060 --> 01:02:12.760
And no doubt you
must practice them.

01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:13.450
No.

01:02:13.450 --> 01:02:14.130
RUTH SHERMAN: I'm
just very animated

01:02:14.130 --> 01:02:15.296
AUDIENCE: That's surprising.

01:02:15.296 --> 01:02:16.880
RUTH SHERMAN: I'm
just very animated.

01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:17.380
Yeah.

01:02:17.380 --> 01:02:20.820
And not everybody has to
be as animated as I am.

01:02:20.820 --> 01:02:24.500
AUDIENCE: So that they-- do
they come naturally to you?

01:02:24.500 --> 01:02:27.860
Or is there a set of
particular hand gestures

01:02:27.860 --> 01:02:29.370
that work better than others?

01:02:29.370 --> 01:02:32.590
Or ones that you recommend
for people that it does not

01:02:32.590 --> 01:02:33.780
come naturally to?

01:02:33.780 --> 01:02:34.500
RUTH SHERMAN: OK.

01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:39.970
So, I think maybe that answer
I gave you was too flip.

01:02:39.970 --> 01:02:41.790
That, no, I don't practice.

01:02:41.790 --> 01:02:44.000
Of course, over the
years I've worked on it.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:45.700
All of this is technique.

01:02:45.700 --> 01:02:46.690
It's technique.

01:02:46.690 --> 01:02:49.570
It's as if you're learning a
golf swing, or a tennis swing,

01:02:49.570 --> 01:02:52.940
or you're learning to
play a musical instrument.

01:02:52.940 --> 01:02:54.490
You're learning technique.

01:02:54.490 --> 01:02:55.870
And that's what this is.

01:02:55.870 --> 01:02:59.620
So one of the techniques that
I learned, in terms of hands,

01:02:59.620 --> 01:03:02.659
is keeping them
below-- you know,

01:03:02.659 --> 01:03:04.450
not waving them around
in front of my face.

01:03:04.450 --> 01:03:06.450
Not having them
up here too much.

01:03:06.450 --> 01:03:08.640
If I'm on a stage,
like I am now.

01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:11.960
A stage, an ish,
a platform, where

01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:14.700
I have more physical
space and latitude,

01:03:14.700 --> 01:03:15.960
I can be more expansive.

01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:18.700
If I'm on a video, I
have to keep it smaller.

01:03:18.700 --> 01:03:21.110
It's one of the problems
that Bernie Sanders, I think,

01:03:21.110 --> 01:03:23.780
had when he was at
the Democratic debate.

01:03:23.780 --> 01:03:26.690
I'll be very interested to
see what he does tomorrow.

01:03:26.690 --> 01:03:29.010
I'll be very interested
to see if he pulls it

01:03:29.010 --> 01:03:30.519
in a little bit for TV.

01:03:30.519 --> 01:03:31.310
Which is different.

01:03:31.310 --> 01:03:32.260
It's a box.

01:03:32.260 --> 01:03:38.790
But keeping them lower, using
them to enhance my words,

01:03:38.790 --> 01:03:41.470
to give meaning to my
words, because they do that.

01:03:41.470 --> 01:03:44.120
And then also not
doing things like this,

01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:45.290
or putting them in pockets.

01:03:45.290 --> 01:03:46.870
Pockets are dangerous.

01:03:46.870 --> 01:03:47.580
They really are.

01:03:47.580 --> 01:03:48.210
They're dangerous.

01:03:48.210 --> 01:03:49.501
Or putting them behind my back.

01:03:52.300 --> 01:03:54.340
Or like this.

01:03:54.340 --> 01:03:56.750
They call this fig leaf.

01:03:56.750 --> 01:03:57.455
Fig leaf.

01:03:57.455 --> 01:03:58.110
[LAUGHTER]

01:03:58.110 --> 01:03:58.910
RUTH SHERMAN: All right?

01:03:58.910 --> 01:04:00.890
Next time you watch a
politician at the podium,

01:04:00.890 --> 01:04:03.090
watch all the aids
standing there like this.

01:04:03.090 --> 01:04:04.920
Fig leaf.

01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:07.810
So these are, yeah, so those
are some things not to do.

01:04:07.810 --> 01:04:11.140
And just watch how
you move your hands

01:04:11.140 --> 01:04:13.320
in your one-on-one
conversations,

01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:16.920
your informal Google
conversations,

01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:20.300
as you're moving through
your daily life here.

01:04:20.300 --> 01:04:21.170
And elsewhere.

01:04:21.170 --> 01:04:23.220
I guarantee you, you use them.

01:04:23.220 --> 01:04:25.990
You just have to bring
that to the stage.

01:04:25.990 --> 01:04:28.430
AUDIENCE: Are you are
techniques universal,

01:04:28.430 --> 01:04:31.370
or are they just for
the American culture?

01:04:31.370 --> 01:04:32.880
Would this work in Brazil?

01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:34.120
RUTH SHERMAN: Great question!

01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:35.730
Yes.

01:04:35.730 --> 01:04:38.680
This is American
business speech culture

01:04:38.680 --> 01:04:40.300
that we're talking about today.

01:04:40.300 --> 01:04:41.705
For sure.

01:04:41.705 --> 01:04:45.180
It is different in other
cultures, as many of you

01:04:45.180 --> 01:04:46.490
already know.

01:04:46.490 --> 01:04:46.990
OK?

01:04:46.990 --> 01:04:49.453
So what is your native country?

01:04:49.453 --> 01:04:50.240
AUDIENCE: India.

01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:50.948
RUTH SHERMAN: OK.

01:04:50.948 --> 01:04:53.220
So it's going to be
different in India.

01:04:53.220 --> 01:04:54.720
It's going to be
different in India.

01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:57.370
It's going to be different
even in other English-speaking

01:04:57.370 --> 01:04:58.220
countries.

01:04:58.220 --> 01:04:59.090
Different in the UK.

01:04:59.090 --> 01:05:00.200
Different in Canada.

01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:04.490
Although Canadian speakers
are very, very similar

01:05:04.490 --> 01:05:06.970
to US business speakers.

01:05:06.970 --> 01:05:07.620
But yes.

01:05:07.620 --> 01:05:09.630
So I guess what
I would say here,

01:05:09.630 --> 01:05:14.010
if you are speaking in the US,
you have to-- when in Rome,

01:05:14.010 --> 01:05:16.670
as they say, do
what the Romans do.

01:05:16.670 --> 01:05:20.050
And if you go back
and speak in India,

01:05:20.050 --> 01:05:22.740
or elsewhere, make sure
you do your homework,

01:05:22.740 --> 01:05:25.520
and see what it is they're
going to find appealing,

01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:27.710
and what it is they're
going to find off-putting.

01:05:27.710 --> 01:05:28.870
That's what I have to do.

01:05:28.870 --> 01:05:30.195
And I get in trouble.

01:05:30.195 --> 01:05:31.500
I get in trouble.

01:05:31.500 --> 01:05:37.560
AUDIENCE: What do you suggest we
should do if, when you can see

01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:38.727
you're losing your audience?

01:05:38.727 --> 01:05:39.643
RUTH SHERMAN: Oh, god.

01:05:39.643 --> 01:05:40.940
That's an awful feeling.

01:05:40.940 --> 01:05:42.310
AUDIENCE: Yeah, do you have
any tips or suggestions

01:05:42.310 --> 01:05:43.940
on how you can bring them back?

01:05:43.940 --> 01:05:47.670
RUTH SHERMAN: OK, my
first tip-- [LAUGHS] Yeah.

01:05:47.670 --> 01:05:51.370
One of the things that
you have to do beforehand,

01:05:51.370 --> 01:05:53.430
you can prevent
losing your audience.

01:05:53.430 --> 01:05:54.620
You can.

01:05:54.620 --> 01:05:59.330
By making sure that your
content has what we call rhythm.

01:05:59.330 --> 01:06:08.090
Rhythm is the interspersing of
stories, quotes, statistics,

01:06:08.090 --> 01:06:13.390
funny things that happen to
you, or have happened to you.

01:06:13.390 --> 01:06:15.500
And they happen to
us on a daily basis.

01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:20.446
Or an interesting
article that you read.

01:06:20.446 --> 01:06:23.000
Any kind of public
information that you

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.280
can bring in to
your presentation,

01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:28.520
and interspersing it
throughout the presentation.

01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:32.200
Because if the presentation is
all theory, all theoretical,

01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:36.960
or all data, all technical,
you will lose your audience.

01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:37.880
You will.

01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:40.380
I don't care where you're
working, or what you're doing.

01:06:40.380 --> 01:06:42.570
As human beings, this
is how we connect.

01:06:42.570 --> 01:06:45.210
And there are ways to make
your information come alive,

01:06:45.210 --> 01:06:46.920
and in how people enjoy it.

01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:50.679
What I did today was, I
don't have it in color.

01:06:50.679 --> 01:06:51.970
I don't have my notes in color.

01:06:51.970 --> 01:06:54.440
I color-code my outline.

01:06:54.440 --> 01:06:58.650
My outline is my points,
the theory, the data,

01:06:58.650 --> 01:07:00.910
the boring stuff.

01:07:00.910 --> 01:07:01.920
OK?

01:07:01.920 --> 01:07:05.390
All the stuff that turns me on
and turns everybody else off

01:07:05.390 --> 01:07:06.470
is in yellow.

01:07:06.470 --> 01:07:07.830
Highlighted in yellow.

01:07:07.830 --> 01:07:09.590
The stories are in pink.

01:07:09.590 --> 01:07:14.550
And the applications, show of
hands, audience participation.

01:07:14.550 --> 01:07:17.310
Maybe I'll put a video up there,
or I'll tell a funny story

01:07:17.310 --> 01:07:18.310
and get people to laugh.

01:07:18.310 --> 01:07:21.410
Where people are physically
engaged in some way,

01:07:21.410 --> 01:07:22.570
that's in green.

01:07:22.570 --> 01:07:27.580
If I see everything, there's too
much yellow, I gotta change it,

01:07:27.580 --> 01:07:31.000
because I know I'm going
to lose the audience.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:32.040
So that's what you do.

01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:34.170
You want to prevent
it to begin with.

01:07:34.170 --> 01:07:36.310
The second thing
that you want to do

01:07:36.310 --> 01:07:38.580
is, if you do see
people falling asleep,

01:07:38.580 --> 01:07:41.597
doing other things, not engaged,
their body language, whatever

01:07:41.597 --> 01:07:44.876
is going wrong, or you
think it's going wrong,

01:07:44.876 --> 01:07:47.390
maybe it's not your fault.
Maybe they had a bad night.

01:07:47.390 --> 01:07:50.950
Maybe the baby kept them up
all night, or they're sick,

01:07:50.950 --> 01:07:54.350
or they've just had a bad
phone call before they

01:07:54.350 --> 01:07:57.530
came into your meeting, and, you
know, something's going badly.

01:07:57.530 --> 01:08:00.520
So it's not always your
fault. I kind of try

01:08:00.520 --> 01:08:05.440
to go there, when I feel
like I'm losing an audience.

01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:07.690
But I think you can prevent
it, for the most part.

01:08:07.690 --> 01:08:10.437
And that was a
huge lesson for me.

01:08:10.437 --> 01:08:12.520
Because just like everybody
else, all that theory,

01:08:12.520 --> 01:08:15.260
all that theoretical
stuff, you know,

01:08:15.260 --> 01:08:17.680
how to breathe to give
a good speaking voice.

01:08:17.680 --> 01:08:19.140
It's like, no.

01:08:19.140 --> 01:08:20.240
No, don't.

01:08:20.240 --> 01:08:23.399
I hired a coach to help me.

01:08:23.399 --> 01:08:24.380
No, you can't say that.

01:08:24.380 --> 01:08:25.930
It's boring.

01:08:25.930 --> 01:08:27.160
OK.

01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:28.097
So it's a big lesson.

01:08:28.097 --> 01:08:28.930
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:08:28.930 --> 01:08:29.439
RUTH SHERMAN: You're welcome.

01:08:29.439 --> 01:08:30.010
Thank you.

01:08:30.010 --> 01:08:30.890
[APPLAUSE]

01:08:30.890 --> 01:08:31.970
Thank you.

01:08:31.970 --> 01:08:33.060
Thank you very much.

01:08:33.060 --> 01:08:34.080
Thanks for coming.

01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:36.299
I hope you all have
a good weekend.
