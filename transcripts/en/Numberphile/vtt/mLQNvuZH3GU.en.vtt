00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.580
RIA SYMONDS: We're talking
about the number 16.

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:03.790
16's a very special
number to me.

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:06.030
It's my actual favorite
number.

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:07.929
MATT PARKER: One of my favorite
numbers is 16.

00:00:07.929 --> 00:00:09.890
And a lot of people
seem to like 16.

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:12.300
Even though it is an even
number, it wins out for being

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.640
a square number.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.250
RIA SYMONDS: It's partially
favorite because I was born on

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.140
the 16th day of December,
to be precise.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.730
And I always liked it because
when I was sweet 16 on the

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.505
16th, I could a lot
of things by then.

00:00:26.505 --> 00:00:28.500
I could go off and get married
if I wanted to.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.380
I could leave school legally.

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:31.986
I didn't, of course.

00:00:31.986 --> 00:00:34.890
But 16 is also mathematically
very special.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.210
It's the square of
a perfect square.

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:38.430
Did you know that?

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:38.790
MATT PARKER: No.

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:39.510
Go on then.

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.670
RIA SYMONDS: Would you
like me to explain?

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:41.230
BRADY HARAN: Yeah, of course.

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:41.670
RIA SYMONDS: OK.

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:42.830
BRADY HARAN: Square of
a perfect square.

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:43.670
What does that mean?

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.380
RIA SYMONDS: So a perfect
square, a good

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:51.240
example is 2 squared.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.400
2 squared, you get 4.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.900
It's perfect because I've
got 2 to the power of 2.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.050
It's the same digit.

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:02.840
If I square this, so all of
that squared, so this is 4

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:10.050
squared, lo and behold, we get
16, my My favorite number.

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.430
MATT PARKER: And I was at a pub
once with some friends of

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.170
mine, and we were drinking
and having fun.

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.350
And we thought we'd
order some food.

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.880
We were on table 16.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:18.885
I went up to the bar.

00:01:18.885 --> 00:01:22.186
And I said, to get food, could
we get delivered to 16?

00:01:22.186 --> 00:01:25.460
And I went, oh, wait, a minute,
which is 4 squared.

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.310
Can I order food to the
table 4 squared?

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.670
And it ended up the poor
girl behind the

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:31.900
bar looked very confused.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.900
And I went, no, actually,
we'll make it easier.

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.910
How about I order
it 2 to the 4?

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:42.240
Because not only is 16 4 times
4, it's also a 2 times 2

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.240
times 2 times 2.

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.120
And then at this point, she
looked very bewildered, and

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.745
later on, we managed to
intercept our food on the way

00:01:48.745 --> 00:01:50.630
to table 24.

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.070
RIA SYMONDS: Let's say I have
the relationship x raised to

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:55.116
the power of y.

00:01:55.116 --> 00:01:58.780
So x and y are two different
integer numbers.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.340
So x cannot equal y.

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.536
So x could be 2, y could be 3.

00:02:05.536 --> 00:02:07.560
We'd have 2 cubed.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.020
Now, they only relation that is
satisfied by this number 16

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:17.211
is that x to the y is
equal to y to the x.

00:02:17.211 --> 00:02:20.640
So the number on this side of
your equal sign is going to be

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.430
exactly the same as the
number on this side

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:24.760
of the equal sign.

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.790
To do that, I'm going to take
the number x is going to be,

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.150
let's say 4.

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.750
Let's take y to be 2.

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.880
If we interpret those onto the
other side of the equation, y

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.000
was 2, and x was 4.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.700
4 to the power 2, we've
already seen it, 16.

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.160
2, raise that to the power
4, you put it into your

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.140
calculator.

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.710
What do you get?

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.660
16.

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.880
And 2 and 4 are the only
numbers that can be

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.550
interpreted as x and y
in order to get this

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.270
relationship, this special
number, 16.

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.370
MATT PARKER: And we thought
there must be other numbers.

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:03.670
And we had a bit of
a chat, and we

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:04.760
realized none of us knew.

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.820
And we all do math things
for a living.

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.090
And we thought, well, let's
work it out, we decided.

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.250
Because you could look it up.

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.640
We could go online and see if
anyone else had tried this.

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:15.360
And we thought, no.

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.540
It's as much fun to work
this out as if no

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:19.520
one else ever has.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.010
And some people went away and
started trying to write

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.040
computer software to see if
there were bigger ones.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.180
And the rest of us were like--

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.840
some people were drawing graphs,
some people were doing

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.180
number theory stuff.

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.610
A lot of prime factors
suddenly appeared.

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:31.610
And other people--

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.690
because this went across
many evenings.

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:34.890
Other people were like, what
are you guys doing?

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.000
I'm like, we're trying to work
out if 16 is the only number

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.870
where you could write it x
to the y, or y to the x.

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.630
RIA SYMONDS: You cannot get
any other number using any

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:47.750
other integers to get a number
that equals itself.

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.450
MATT PARKER: 16 is the only
number, and we've since

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.190
realized other people do know
about this, and it's a nice

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:55.450
property of 16.

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.510
But we had the joy of working
it out for ourselves.

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.260
So if you get bored,
you can check why.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.380
And it's fascinating
why 16 is the only

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.060
number that does that.

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:06.840
BRADY HARAN: That's
pretty cool.

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:07.320
RIA SYMONDS: Mm-hm.

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:08.100
I think so.

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.330
BRADY HARAN: Yeah.

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:10.710
MATT PARKER: Initially,
it was just a lot of

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:11.795
arguing over food.

00:04:11.795 --> 00:04:14.220
So people walking by
just saw us eating.

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.579
And someone would go,
well, what about 64?

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:17.555
And then there would be
a bit of I don't know.

00:04:17.555 --> 00:04:20.089
Then someone else wold
go, no, not 64.

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:21.550
Oh, OK, and we're back
to the food.

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:22.900
BRADY HARAN: Is that why it's
your favorite number?

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.330
Or is it just because
of your birthday?

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.310
RIA SYMONDS: Because
it's my birthday.

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.510
This is just a cool
relationship.

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:30.780
MATT PARKER: Often during
lessons, we'd be like, what if

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.070
it's, and then someone would
go, I've got a log.

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:34.290
Check out this log graph.

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.690
This is it.

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.610
And we'd go, oh, I don't know.

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.440
And actually, this was
the beginning--

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.650
if I can get distracted briefly,
is the beginning of

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:44.160
something called Math Jam, which
is an organization I run

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.380
where people get together
in a pub and do math.

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:49.400
Because we realized we started
off in this pub drinking, and

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:50.420
we actually did math.

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:52.930
And then later on, we were doing
more and more, and other

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:54.900
puzzles started to show up.

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:59.040
We realized that 36 is both a
square number and a triangle

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.870
number, but that's a whole
different video.

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.670
And we suddenly thought, why
are we having these debates

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:07.120
when we're meant to be
teaching school kids?

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.520
Why don't we get rid of the
school kids and just replace

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.340
them with tasty beverages?

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.040
And so ever since--

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.840
and now it's all around
the world.

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:19.140
Last count, 14 or 15 different
cities in the UK and other

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:22.530
countries have Math Jams, where
people get together on

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:25.755
the second to last Tuesday of
the month and talk about math,

00:05:25.755 --> 00:05:27.540
and do problems, and
play with toys.

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:32.680
And yeah, all because I sat
down in a pub at table 16.
