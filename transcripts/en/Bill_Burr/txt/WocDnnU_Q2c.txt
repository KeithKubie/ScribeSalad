Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:00:02       Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burr and It's time for the Thursday afternoon. Just before Friday. Monday morning podcast and

Speaker 1:          00:00:08       Ahhh,

Speaker 3:          00:00:13       just checking in on you. Just checking in on you.

Speaker 2:          00:00:18       What's going on? Let me do that. Like I'm falling off a cliff.

Speaker 4:          00:00:23       Oh,

Speaker 2:          00:00:26       I woke up this morning. [inaudible] I had the dumbest song in my head and I can't get it out and now I'm going to sing it to you so it'll be stuck in your head. It's a very vengeful thing for me to do. It's something that, you know, pieces of shit guys. Do you know if I'm going down, I'm taking you down with me and all those kinds of pieces. Shits, you know they do that. Uh, the ladies, the ladies like to dabble in that. Well, fuck you. This is in a relationship. At least I'm getting some of your tee shirts, right? They're going to get something from it. Well, look, this song's going to be stuck in my head. I'm sorry to say that it's going to be stuck in yours head too. All right, and I've given you a good, I've been talking about this for a good 18 seconds. Says plenty of time. Even if you're driving in the car, he hit pause and you're choosing not to. Why do you do this to yourself? Why don't you just choose the road that's going to bring you true happiness is the, because you grew up and you watched people being abused and you felt like you didn't have a choice in life that this is the way it was. You know what that last 10 seconds is probably going to be worse than the song, but here it is.

Speaker 4:          00:01:32       [inaudible] I hold up my head

Speaker 2:          00:01:38       and at the edge it's something. It's up dead. Huh? I don't know who sings that song. I don't think I've ever gotten past those first two lines of that song. It's always comes on session presents love songs from the 70s or the, yeah, this one

Speaker 3:          00:02:01       [inaudible] big [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:02:06       right, and you sit in and go look at this fucking horse shit and you start thinking about your childhood. Next thing you know you're on the phone with the operator. Could they get the deluxe edition? Yeah, I still have a CD player in my car. Well, because I'm frugal. It's not because I'm failing. And I resent you saying that. Of course. I still want the CDS. I'm speaking of my old car, my car. I've had it since, uh, October of 2007. It's a 2008. Oh, is it brand new? It will hit it fucking stars in its eyes, right. Just stepped off the bus here in Hollywood with a piece of Straw between its seat. Like axl rose in the guns and roses video. A welcome to a welcome to the jungle. I'm there now. Look at it. Oh, this thing, it looks like somebody attacked it with a fucking can opener. Right? It did as until as of the other day.

Speaker 5:          00:03:01       My, uh, my wife was out of town. She was in New York City for the great Patrice O'Neal benefit. I want to thank everybody who came out and I want to thank everyone who did the show. I unfortunately was not able to get a fucking flight in and time, if you can believe that. I actually missed the benefit. Fucking brutal. I had a flight out a Saturday morning, Saturday, and I believe that when I was on American Airlines and they just gave me a call and like, like a, you know, when a one 800 number and I went hello. And they were like, hello that says American Airlines at four McGill, they have like two nighter was three as by gads you're then relocated. No, you might want to grab a pad. You'll now bed. Rebooked like ever. What? Zev it thanks. Zero out of l a x on Tuesday, January 26 at 1:50 PM a the benefit was on the 26th I was supposed to be flying out on the 23rd.

Speaker 5:          00:04:03       They pushed it three fucking days and I was gonna leave for 15 east coast time when the show starts at seven. So I'm like, well that's not gonna work. So I call my travel agent, you know, and so she got me a flight on JetBlue, 7:45 AM on, um, Sunday, the 24th. So I'm like, no worries. All right, so I miss a day, no big deal. Blah, blah, blah, blah. Right. And then I get a call, I get a call like the night before, I'm all packed and got my shit right next to the door and there's like that [inaudible] blow inmate one out of their bed and a piece of paper, right? And then they fucking Bob me to fucking Tuesday. So I said, fuck these guys. I call my travel agent again. Now I'm on virgin. All right. I don't know why they call it Virgin Airlines and then it looks so dizzy in that fucking thing.

Speaker 5:          00:04:52       It's like at the w hotel was a plane, you know, with the fucking aquarium lighting that just says no one wants to see a good look of their face in a mirror after they do what they do in here. Right. So they booked me on that fucking thing and they're like, well, the time we can get you out is right when the New England patriots game starts. And I'm like, oh, that guy, you got TV, I fuck it. Put me on it. Right. And then that one got canceled. So at that point I did deduced if I'm using the word properly, that uh, that the fucking every, every poor bastard from Saturday and Sunday now that those flights at all been canceled, we're now eating up all the Monday and Tuesday ones. So, um, I had my travel agent go after another flight and then meanwhile I called my manager, who knows all these big guys and I said, can you get me a replacement in case I could, I'm not going to be able to get it.

Speaker 5:          00:05:50       Long story short, I wasn't able to get in in time. We got a replacement and a, I wish I could have been there because a rich vos who crushed it as a host once again this year and he said, a blah, blah, blah, blah. Unfortunately bill burrow can't be here. And everyone's like, oh, what the fuck? Where is the red country? Right. And he said, ah, that's the bad news. He said, the good news is Louis C K and Louis C K walked out and they would fucking absolutely mental. And, uh, you know, I was replaced one balding redhead with another balding red head with more credits so nobody missed me. Um, and I guess he fucking murdered it. And then the only to do is 15 cause he's such a great guy, didn't like 25, um, and just fucking destroyed and everybody had a great time. And uh, somebody sent me a picture of, um, I've, everybody in the end coming out, Al del Benny flew in all the way from Sydney, Australia.

Speaker 5:          00:06:50       That's another reason why I didn't want to reschedule cause this guy flew in from the other side of the fucking world. And um, Oh, who else was there? Rachel phones find saying Greer Barnes who absolutely murdered, you know, one of the greatest to ever did it. Greer Barnes. Um, Jim Norton, I don't have it in front of me. I wasn't there too, so I know I'm going to end up forgetting somebody. But uh, anyways, everybody, God freak did it. Everybody fucking killed. And uh, they had a great time. So anyway, so I was out here and I was supposed to be in New York from Saturday until Wednesday. So nobody knew that I was out here, you know, so I was just like, well fuck it. I'm not telling anybody I'm here. And I just started handling a bunch of shit that I'd been putting off for months, if not years.

Speaker 5:          00:07:43       Um, I did everything from, uh, get my last will together, my, you know, when I die or whatever, make sure that everything goes to the people who needs to go to. So there's no fighting hopefully. Um, which is actually, it's really morbid, but it's also fucking kind of cool. It's, I can't fucking, you take this and you take that in a, I'm out of here. Good luck to is I had a great time and a great ass. Um, I rolled change that we hadn't jars. I handled that and I dropped my fucking Prius off and I had all the fucking dense repaired you should say. Looks Brand fucking new. There's a couple of little ones that they just stay left in there. They buffed the whole thing up. I didn't get new bottlers because you know, you have new bumpers out here. They last for about three days before somebody just bumps into them.

Speaker 5:          00:08:39       So a, I just had them bought those things up and it looks fucking great. And I'll tell you right now, having a paid off Prius with 80,000 something miles on it. I'm in La. La is the greatest fucking car you could ever drive. It's just, it's the shit and it takes the hits too. It's like Ben Roethlisberger. It just fucking shakes him off and he's get keeps going and amount of how bad the gas prices get. I've never paid more than 40 bucks a gallon. I don't give a fuck if somebody runs into it. Um, I could park it wherever I want. Nobody's gonna take it. It's fucking perfect. Right? I bought my wife a nice car. It's nice. I can't stand it. I can't, you know, I feel like when I'm driving that thing. Do you guys ever see that fucking hilarious Howard Stern's movie, private parts? Do you remember when he was showing himself when he first became a DJ in lake? When he went to put the needle on the record and he scratched and he fucked the whole thing up. Remember that noise? Who's making, who's going home?

Speaker 1:          00:09:37       Hello? Hello? Hello. That's

Speaker 5:          00:09:39       what I feel like when I drive that car. Like I'll be going to the grocery store and I'll just be thinking like, God damn and I need to go in there and buy some fucking hamburger. But you know, if I don't see a bunch of wide open spaces, I won't parking in there. Cause I know somebody's going to come in and just park right next to it and fucking oh fun door right into the side of it and it's gonna make me fucking sick. You know, it's like when you go to a movie, right? Like right now is a great time to go see star wars. Maybe in another fucking week. Right? Nobody's going to be there. You go see a matinee, right? It's during the work week. You're a comedian, you got a Gig that night. You say, fuck fucking, I'm going to go. I'm going to go see a matinee showing of star wars fucking six weeks after it came out, right?

Speaker 5:          00:10:24       You go in there, there's nobody fucking there. You get your feet up, you having a great time. It is fucking inevitable that someone's gonna walk in during the fucking trailers. They're gonna sit down or right behind you and they're going to talk much popcorn fucking loudly. Or they're going to be fucking dress like Chewbacca and there's going to going to be getting hair in their mouth or their thing. Gonna be doing that the entire fucking time. It's a net the same, the same way that is inevitable. If you park in a, in a, in a parking lot, some con, even if there's a bunch of fucking spaces is going to pull in right next to you and they can open their fucking door right into it, you know, and that's just regular people forget about out of shape. People who they, they gotta like put stress on their hinges of their doors to just make it wide enough, you know? You know, that's where you know you're fat. When you get like one of those Formula One fucking steering wheels that just pops out so you can get your gut out.

Speaker 5:          00:11:21       You keep lying to yourself. I'll tell you, they don't make these Ford Broncos as big as they used to. Yeah, they do. Yeah, they do. They most certainly fucking do. Um, so anyways, speak at a cars too. And I saw there's somebody up the street, man. It's going to kill a fucking car. It's one of those Volkswagen. Uh, it's not the bug. It's not the Carmen Guian. It's the fucking station wagon. And they put some white walls on it and some fucking fog lights. They got the luggage rack on it. It's fucking cool as shit. I love station wagon. Ah, I love a station wagon. I'm sorry, I got a little fucking, uh, who's that guy? It's as big as oh, well, and it's about test sets sail.

Speaker 4:          00:12:07       So,

Speaker 5:          00:12:09       um, hang on. Sorry. Sorry. I'm singing all these fucking songs. It's a little old place where you could get together and do what, what kind of depravity goes on in a love shack.

Speaker 1:          00:12:23       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:12:23       Does that song even make sense?

Speaker 1:          00:12:26       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:12:27       They just went out to a shack and they fucked, I mean, maybe I'm taking it too literally. Uh, what was I looking up? Oh yeah, the, uh, the Volkswagen station wagon. The Volkswagen. This is Zyvox Vox Vargon station. Vagan uh, classic VW station or Wag on, let's see what this thing's called. There it is. The fuck is it called? So I got all the, uh, the pictures of it. That's such a fucking cool car, man. I love the front end on it. And the guy also had it in a stick shift, which I think is a picture below a rear view of the Volkswagen beetle from 61 to seven 67. That's not what I wanted. One of these days. One of these days, I'm just going to look shit up.

Speaker 1:          00:13:14       Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:13:15       You know, before it starts. And I'll have a nice news podcast. I'm imitating my, my science teacher from a

Speaker 1:          00:13:25       okay.

Speaker 5:          00:13:26       From high school when he was talking about some sort of biology thing, he said, there's, there's rough and smooth, I forget what it was. And he was like, this is all rough and smooth. And he used to make a joke out of it and everybody would laugh and you'd never get it wrong on the test. Bam. You know why there's not more funny teachers is because they all become comedians. Cause it just like, all right, I'm basically doing stand up here and a, I'm not making any money, so fuck these kids and their future.

Speaker 1:          00:13:54       Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:13:55       Volkswagen type three square back. That's all it's called. Come on. They had to give it a better name than that. Oh, this is some fucking gearhead thing. God Damn fucking bastards. Can you just tell me the name of the fucking car?

Speaker 4:          00:14:10       Well, he did formation. You think I could look it up

Speaker 5:          00:14:19       by the mid sixties it was clear that Volkswagen's iconoclastic, thinks small campaign on behalf of the lowly beetle had succeeded in transforming the third hike. Wait a minute. Wait, what the fuck is this about Hitler? I'm trying to read about the fucking Karmann Ghias type two maybe it is a Karmann Ghia. I, you know what the fuck I'm talking about. You know what? I'll just put a picture up. How about that? I'll, I'd put a picture of that. Hey, did anybody see bill Bellacheck a football life? It was a two Pi and I gotta admit I was bored shitless. I, I've never been more bored watching a football life even when it was him and Tom Brady's sitting in the office. I was, it was fucking egghead shit, but it was just all monotone. Just calling. Yeah. Yeah. Lions have a, uh, a good defense. So, uh, you know, I'm gonna put together a game plan and then Tom Brady be like smiling, but just going like, yeah, I thought maybe we could have the, uh, the running back come out of the backfield. We could explain some things, uh, the underneath of their a secondary.

Speaker 1:          00:15:21       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:15:22       Oh yeah. Tell him I'm going to look into that. Okay, Bill. And that'll be like seen. It was like fucking, even when he got emotional, when he went to giant stadium, I was just like, this is a no, he didn't get in volt motion of like, if you want to see the emotional why you got to see the Dick from meal one. But I was, I, I can't even watch it. I feel like a bad patriots fan. I cannot get fucking through it. Um, maybe I will eventually. So actually, um, that was another thing I did when I was here. I was just binge watching shit. I watched the whole first season of top boy on Netflix. It's only four episodes a fucking good show, man. And I just started the second one last night and a,

Speaker 1:          00:16:05       yeah,

Speaker 5:          00:16:06       I watched this documentary on na's who I never got, I never got it. When illmatic came out I was like, I don't like this. I don't get it right. And now I went back and listened to it as like, oh, wait a minute. This is fucking unbelievable. You gotta admit. Okay. When you're younger, there's a lot, sometimes there's albums that come out or, or artists that come by and you just don't see them cause you're like, Eh, you know, he's an older guy. Like, like David Bowie. I never want to see that guy live. And now doing the classic, now that he's dead, let me take another listen to his fucking music. And I, you know, I had that fucking album. Like everybody has that album. I had the Ziggy stardust one and a, that's still an amazing fucking album obviously, but it's been played to death. But that was killer. But I downloaded diamond dogs. It's fucking on. It's unreal. And I was like, I many times could I have seen this guy, I could have seen him on the let's dance. Toilet dance.

Speaker 6:          00:17:03       Well yeah, red shoes, a little blue.

Speaker 5:          00:17:08       Um, I could have seen him on any of those and I never did. You know Bob Newhart's play playing out Friday night. I'm not going to get a chance to see him. His fucking show is sold out. It's like way the fuck out in the desert and a, I got something nine 30 the next morning so I can't go fucking see the guy. And uh, so I'm trying to make a bucket list of guys I gotta go fucking see. I hope they don't, none of nobody plays this farm cause I'm going to see them because not only I respect him as an artist, but I also, it's, I'm afraid they're gonna die, you know? Uh, I don't want to jinx anybody, but you know, they are our even you just want to see before they quit touring, right. Everyone from Tony Bennett to Stevie wonder

Uh, what did I just want to talk about? Something in there reminded me of something. Oh yeah, the fucking, I'm going to be going to Denver when I go to Denver. They're either going to be super bowl champions or they're going to be depressed that they lost, but they're probably still going to give me shit that they beat my patriots. But I've got to tell you this, man, this is pretty cool. Do you know Denver's the only team, the New England patriots have a losing record too. And I know a lot of you guys love fucking Denver, and I'm actually thinking like, I can't believe that's true because I watched the Patriots before Tom Brady. All right? And I think there was very few people that we had a winning record against.

Speaker 2:          00:22:24       And the fact that, uh, who's kidding who bill Bellacheck came in with drew Bledsoe and that really started turning shit around and, um, just the way that they've won over this since like 2000 or 2001 by really like the last 20 years, the way they've won, they were, let's see, 20, 35, they were 35 years or 35, 33 years in or 32 years in when drew Bledsoe took over and drew Bledsoe took over 24 years ago. So, you know, that's what it took. It took two and a half decades to undo fucking three decades of fucking up. And, um, I think that's amazing. Now you're probably going, well, why, why the fuck? What are the Broncos doing? You always got to play in that altitude. It was always snowing. And then they had Craig Morton and the orange crushed defense in the 70s. And, uh, I think before that they had that Floyd little great running back, Randy gradish shack, um, Hayven Moses, Rick up church there. They always had some fucking guys. And then they got John Elway in 83 and that fucked after Craig Morton, they went, you know, a few years and then 83 Elway came in and that fucked us from 83 to 98. So even when we had drew Bledsoe

Speaker 5:          00:23:46       for the first fucking six, seven years, it was against, uh, John Elway who's like top three all time, I think, you know what I mean? Um, I'd actually put him ahead of a Peyton, Manny, um, personally, personally speaking. Um, so I'm actually excited that there's 32 fucking teams were one of them. So up the 31 other teams, 30 of them, we had a winning record against. Can anybody else make that claim? I don't think they can. All right, sorry. So Anybody Watch, AH, 60 minutes. This past week they did a, um, they did this feature Phagia on mountain lions and now California is the only state that has mountain lions. Just walking around. I, I'm gonna fuck this up in a, in a park, I guess maybe the size of like Griffith Park or Runyon Canyon or, or whatever those ones are out in, uh, out in the valley. I guess they have these fucking things.

Speaker 5:          00:24:48       And, um, so anyways, I was watching it because a few of the places was where I hike with my dog and this thing has intermittently, this, this, this group of fucking mountain lions has been around there. But fortunately they, they try to avoid you I guess, um, at least during the day if then I fucking hungry. But they showed this fucking, uh, these people, this mountain lion, right, okay. They were having some work done. So they had somebody going underneath the house into the crawl space of their house and they were right up against this park. And the guy went down there and he immediately came back up and he was fucking like white as a ghost and they were like a don de s, you know, fucking white people turn to speak Spanish three Oh eight.

Six tarantulas in a frog, but as pet cobra was missing, this was in his fucking car. Thompson was rushed to blah, blah, blah, or he later died. Yeah, I don't think in Austin they're going to have shit for a cobra unless they got a zoo nearby rang. It was located above. Above. Police believe that Thompson committed suicide by allowing the venomous snake to bite them. Surely before he was found Tuesday, the team posted a cryptic message to his Facebook page. Writing, I'm sorry. Thompson's family owns a pet shot in temple, Texas. He'd worked for the store most of his life. He could handle tarantulas like they were kittens. He loved the animals and loves spreading awareness about animals in the community. NAHB Saatchi was performed Thursday, but authorities at waiting for the toxin. What the fuck?

Accidental death accidentally getting bit by a Cobra and the wrist in the parking lot of a Lowe's in Austin, Texas. All, all right. Anyways, that's the podcast. I hope you guys have a great weekend and stay away from the snakes. So you know what Australia, alright, that was deliberate. So we can't count that one. So we, we uh, we had three times as many deaths as you did.

Speaker 5:          00:35:51       So why don't you tone down how fucking nuts you stayed as or your country, whatever it is. Right island, you know, it's not that fucking dangerous. You know what it is. We buy into it because of the fucking, uh, the shrimp on the Barbie guy, Paul Hogan and then the crocodile hunter. You know, and when you really think about it, how did the crocodile hunter die? Was it one of those snakes that he was constantly fucking with? Was it any other, the land animals that he was constantly fucking with? It was not, he fucked with the sting ray and he forgot that those things always are armed. They always have a shank. He got stuck right, like a fucking prisoner. Um, as enough time gone by that you can actually address the foolishness of that death. Like, let me fucking go. Just jump on the back of a sting ray. You know, and I'm not talking about the corvette people, I'm talking about the actual fucking fish. Where do you job boasting raid? You gotta Watch that tail a little stab you in the heart. You swim to the surface and police out. I'm sorry. Anyways, that's, that's the podcast for this Thursday afternoon. Have a wonderful weekend you cards. Um, my condolences to their kid in the Lowe's parking lot into the crocodile hunter, even to Paul Hogan. You know, I don't know what he's up to. I hope he's got a new hat though, you know, nice new, fresh head. Um, and with that, here's a little bit of music from Andrew [inaudible] and a little bit of throwback podcasts

Speaker 8:          00:37:35       from a, from a year ago. [inaudible]

Speaker 9:          00:38:03       I'm not crazy like my brother, but it's where the Achoo whoever this auto, I know Brown with the session when I got Gamblin who is what y'all bread, man, mom, all that. I was that positive and that wasn't a [inaudible]. That is, it built a bit of a dilemma here for you. I'm an

Speaker 2:          00:38:40       18 year old male who is about to graduate from high school. Congratulations. Um, over the past few years I've been told I'm a really good dancer. Not Ballet or artsy stuff, but just good dance floor dancing. Oh my God, I'm going to take over the dance floor. Hey Angie, watch me your John Travolta. This is great. Do you go out to the a Staten island bridge and do headstands with your, with your buddy Bobby? You know, if he didn't have an Afro, he never would've fell off that bridge if he had it high and tight. Like all these Armenians out here, all, every Armenian looks like they know, uh, they, they know m m m m a moose. Last time you saw in our Armenian dude in his twenties or thirties, and he did not look like he could put you in an armbar within two seconds if he wanted to.

Speaker 2:          00:39:30       If I W if I was Dana white and I was running the UFC at one point that this point, what are up to like what, like UFC 2006 you know, they're like running, they've run out of adjectives this time. It's really, really personal, right? Not Saying I'm not a fan of a huge fucking fan, I'm just saying, you know, the way they, they have those things like every other week there's only so many like you know, redemption. I mean you've run out of words. Um, I'm such a fucking idiot. This is what I would do if I was dating white at some point I would have, you know, you know what I would, this is what I would branch off. And when they had those tough man competitions and they would have just people coming in, throwing haymakers, which is some of the best boxing ever is when you watch people who just aren't trained whatsoever and they just start, you know, cause somebody is going to connect.

Speaker 2:          00:40:20       Right. I think that they should have one week they should have the Armenians versus the Russians. Tough man competition. Because I really think that that needs, it needs to be decided who is the tougher of the two? Uh, cause more now when it comes to white people, that's, that's who I got my money on. All right. That, those, those are the crips and the bloods of white people is the army and the Russians, all of them, they just have that vibe. This something you just like, yeah. I'm not fucking with that guy. Just really, I'm really not doing it anyways. Uh, not a ballet or artsy stuff. Uh, but just ballroom dates in a full contagion over here. Uh, I kinda think of think dancing is gay from an outside point of view. Um, I it isn't, it really isn't. That's just how white people look at it.

Speaker 2:          00:41:14       It's considered gay cause it involves like letting yourself go and actually admitting that you have emotions as a man, as a white male. Yeah. It's, yeah, it is. It's considered gay. Um, as is crying, as is showing any sort of emotion as is not dying for no good goddamn reason before you're 56. I'm not dying, I should say. If you live to be 60, I believe amongst white men, that's also considered gay. Cause that means at some point you cried something out of your chest and you didn't have a heart attack. Um, anyways, he says, I think, uh, dancing is gay from an outside point of view, but I'll be the first one to admit that I'm actually a pretty good dancer if I didn't think so, I wouldn't be out there doing it. Yeah. But Dude, you gotta be getting some, I'll, I'll fucking, women love a guy who can dance. If you can dance and you're wearing like a silk scarf, it's fucking over. It's going to be rain and pussy. As far as my outside view, my freckled view from over in the bar trying to stand out from underneath those hot lights so I don't get burned. Uh, you know, red heads with the closest thing to vampires. You know, we have, we, we have none of the powers of vampires, but the sun affects us the same.

Speaker 7:          00:42:30       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:42:31       A friend of mine who is a female dead keeps telling me I could make money doing it on commercials or music videos, parentheses clothes on. Or You could go to fucking Broadway and be like one of the five straight men who dances on Broadway and just tag every fucking lonely chick out there who's all stretched out. Just make sure you keep their shoes on. Dancer's feet are always fucked up. Uh, here's where it gets complicated. I plan on becoming a policeman. Oh Dude, this is, this is a no brainer. You need the dance it Bachelorette parties dressed as a cop. All you need, dude, is that a fake uniform on a boombox and you're on your way to making money? Dude, you should fucking do that in a second. And then you write a book about it. I was a gyrate and cop for Bachelorette parties.

Speaker 2:          00:43:20       You write a tell all book about how many fucking broads, who bought ready got married, go get married, sucked your Dick. You really need help on this one. I mean I'm going to read the rest of it, but I think I've already come with the solution anyways. How is anyone supposed to take me seriously on the force? If there's a video going with me, pop and locking next to little Wayne at the same time, I'll, dude, you should fucking pull people over. You should pull people over and fucking moonwalk up to their car and just freak them out. Even if they were reaching for a gun, they'd be laughing too hard and they, they, they wouldn't shoot you. Then you could rest them and then you move up. Next thing you know, you're a commissioner, right? Nothing. Anyways, at the same time, I'm getting laid a lot because of it.

Speaker 2:          00:44:00       Of course you are. I'm a seven. On a scale of 10. I like this guy. He's honest and um, uh, and like having a jumpshot, it's put me up to an eight, five, um, Bang, intense. I've always wanted to be a cop at the parks here. Seen better. If I was able to make money doing it over in a dancing thing, I wouldn't just be getting hammers for letting gross moms off on speeding tickets. I could be banging J-lo. She's into dancers, right? Thanks. Yeah. APP's a fucking lutely dude. You're basically saying, what should I do here? Should I bang j Lo's beat down at the club and make all this fucking money? Or should I take a job where I'm going to get shot at and not be appreciated? You know, I'll tell you every cop out there with dance, if they could, as opposed to being a cop, I don't care if they'd like seven generations in.

Speaker 2:          00:44:57       Dude, this is what I think of as far as like dancing. I think if I, if I like compare it to being a comedian, oh, the open mics would be getting a piece of part cardboard and being on a subway platform, making money that way. And then when you move up to hosting a show that would be addressed as a cop and you fucking dance it. Bachelorette parties, that's what you do on the side. That's like your fucking day job. That bullshit. And then during the day, I, yeah, I would try out for those. Fuck, I don't, did they make music videos anymore or fucking, uh, I dunno. I believe it or not. I don't know how to climb the ladder as a dancer, but dude, apps a fucking lutely if you could make money doing that shit. And then what the great thing is, is once you get to a certain level to, to, uh, make more money, you know, once you've got some credibility, you can, you always have the fallback where you can teach your class.

Speaker 2:          00:45:58       They can, you can be like, I danced for nine years and Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and fucking banged every fucking broad on there. And then if you'd like to know how to fuck the women in your cast while still not losing your job, come on down the Frankie's fucking data studio or whatever, just you'll figure it out as you go in there. And, um, yeah, absolutely. Absolute fucking Lulea. I would definitely do it. You want to do what you want and taking the time, um, to write in. So your big fears should be whatever, everybody's big fears. Like what if I fucking go after this dream and I'm 30 and I'm sleeping on a fucking futon and it hasn't happened yet. Well, I gotta tell you something, sir. I'd been there. I was there at fucking 34. I was still sleeping on a futon and a fucking studio apartment that they call the one bedroom, cause they slammed a fucking wall in there and put a door on it.

Speaker 2:          00:46:47       And then one day I was trying to bang the girl upstairs who had the fucking apartment, right, right, right above me. And it was the exact same unit. And hers was a studio, but she had been there longer so they never slammed a wall in there. And I realized, Hey, wait a minute, I'm getting fucked. You know, I should go down there and try to get some money taken off of this. I should go down to the A, they're fucking me over rental board. But I didn't, I said, fuck it. Just keep writing jokes. Right. So whatever all you gotta do, you just gotta commit to this shit. And, uh, and then realized that, you know, sleep on Futon when you're 30 is not the worst thing. It isn't. You don't see what, you know, it's worse than sleeping on Futon at 30, sleeping in a king bed next to a fucking woman you're not really love with, but for some reason and a, you've got a couple of kids and you've got a job that you fucking hate. Okay? You'll be laying there fantasizing about fucking sleeping on a, on a, on a, uh, on a futon there. There's no risk when you go after a dream, it's all fucking reward. It's all gonna lead to something good. It always does. There's a tremendous amount of risk to playing it safe and uh, that leads to unbelievable levels of regret, which is something else I've also experienced. Cause I'm an old man.

Speaker 8:          00:48:05       [inaudible]

Speaker 9:          00:48:06       no man. Cross [inaudible] to and say down. This is titled the frayed

Speaker 2:          00:48:43       break up with girlfriend. You Man, I'm gonna read slow. So this takes up as much time as possible. Hey Bill. Um, I'd like to get your advice on something. I've been dating my girlfriend for almost a year now and I've been thinking about breaking up with her. Well, it's time to break up with her, sir. All right. And dating her for a year. You know you have to still even thinking about breaking Ed's time.

Speaker 10:         00:49:05       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:49:07       I says we get along fine and we rarely argue. I was just thinking of a great, a great way to break up with someone they should invent like a breakup suit, right? Just something where you just cannot get injured and you just put the thing on with the fucking helmet. You don't wear the helmet, you just put the ones he'd zip up on and which totally protects everything. Right? And then you get in the passenger seat and you let her drive. Oh, why are you gonna let me drive? Why did you just drive tonight? But you always liked to drive honey. You just drive. Okay, why are you wearing that suit? It's all going to make sense at about five miles, right? You get out on the fucking highway and you just start talking to her and out of no way. He just put the helmet on, you know, when she says, what are you doing?

Speaker 2:          00:49:54       And just say, listen, I don't want to go out with you anymore. And then she goes, what? And you go, hey, watch this. And he just opened the door and you roll out of the fucking car. That's it. You're out. You know, type up the fake police report. You tell him that you died, then she feels bad for you. You don't have to deal with any sort of repercussions. Um, anyways, he says, we get along fine and we rarely argue, but I'm starting to realize I don't really want to be with her for the long haul. When we started dating, oh, this fucking thing. These iPads suck by the way. All right. You know what an iPad is? It's fucking laptop for pussies. What's the matter? Your laptop is too heavy. You fucking douchebag this thing doesn't have a keyboard. It's got nothing. You think that they don't know how to make this thing into a fucking laptop already.

Speaker 2:          00:50:38       Of course they do. This is the Steve jobs way of doing things rather than just giving you the whole fucking thing. He's going to give you an intro increments like a God damn drug dealer. You know? That's why I haven't bought one of these yet. This is Nias by the way, borrowed this fucking thing and I am not enjoying it. As you can tell as I'm throwing a temper tan from here. You know what? I'm going to buy a fucking iPad. I'm going to buy it when it is a laptop, when it is a little light laptop. Until then I'm not, I'm not having this fucking this. This is like, this is like when you know you go, I know I really want to get the new Camaro and then you get the one with the v six engine rather than getting the full out one with the stick shift, which is a laptop, right.

Speaker 2:          00:51:20       It's too heavy, you know, fucking deuce. Do Shoulders at the gym next time you do that. Okay. Maybe do that. Maybe to do some stuff to build up your risks. Oh God. Bill. Can you get through the question? All write a well, um, he says, uh, when we first started dating, I loved hanging out with her, but I'm just not into it anymore. Does that make me an asshole? No, it doesn't. Why would your own true feelings make you an Asshole, sir? How awful were your parents? Um, he says, I'm 23 years old with a somewhat, why am I, you know, I'm a really being a cunt this week. This guy's him for my advice. Let's try to bring the anger down. Bill, you're frustrated. It's fucking hot in here. You can't open the window because you say cunt too much. This building's a co op and they'll kick you up.

Speaker 2:          00:52:03       Okay. That's what's going on here. It has nothing to do with this person. Okay? Why don't you just try to be a nice guy so I should've done off the Mike like I'm scolding myself. Just try to be a nice guy. Let's not take out your bad day on everyone else. Okay? You're embarrassing me. All right. I'm 23 years old, but somewhat of a decent job and really just want to go back to being single for a while. Exactly. Dude, you're 23 years old, dude. You're fucking movie star at that age. I don't care what you're doing for a living. Should definitely be single. I said, the problem is she's got a lot less, she's got a lot of stress in her life right now. Not your problem. She's finishing nursing school and trying to find a job. All right, well tell her to put on the outfit Banger one more time and hey, watch this. You bail out of the car. That's mean. Um, anyways. He says, oh, and she has a history of depression over the past year. I feel like she is becoming emotionally dependent on me. Like I'm keeping her going or something. Well, Jesus Christ the one. Do you want to get rid of her? You don't want this.

Speaker 7:          00:53:08       You know,

Speaker 2:          00:53:10       you want something that someone that's gonna be fun to be around. You don't want her, you know, it's sunny out and she's like, it's raining out the fucking head under the pillow. One of these days, you know, he stayed with that long enough one these days you just gonna it's going to smother with that pillow. So anyways, so how do I go about breaking up with her while causing the least amount of damage? Uh, he said also she always leaves some of her shit in my apartment. Yes. Cause she's, she wants to fucking Oh yeah, she's calling an idea. You says clothes, blanket. Other random shit. I tried to get her to take a shit home with her, but how do I avoid after the after breakup coming over to get my stuff? I hate that. Anyway. Go Fuck Yourself. All right,

Speaker 7:          00:54:01       look,

Speaker 2:          00:54:03       there's no way. There's no easy way to break up with somebody. All right. There's just easier ways. Uh, the sooner the better. Um, oh Diane, I'll do this is, this is like dismantling a bomb. So you know what you would like to do is say, Hey, can you come by today? I want to talk to you about something. Right. And she always share. I'll be right over and then immediately just take out a box, put all over shit in it. Tape it up and then she rings the Bell Bing Bomb. You Open the door, you get, yeah, don't want to date you anymore. And he just handed the box and close the door right to there's money to be made in this man. Does anybody have a professional breakup service at such a pussy thing to do? But that would be phenomenal. You know, you feel, you make your person feel like they got fired.

Speaker 2:          00:54:55       You're like what a corporation fires you and just two security people show up, you know, confiscate your computer and then escort you out of the building when that'd be great. Do, that's what you should do. Just hire two of your friends to dress up. Like security guards. Tell her you want to break up, you know. And then they have all their shit in the box. Then they escort, escort or right out of your apartment building. Like she got fired. They come off as professional rather than like personal. Um, how do you go about breaking up with it? You know what I would do? Um, I wouldn't put all this shit in the box cause that's going to come off cold, you know, and you don't want to hurt her feelings like that. So I would just, uh, uh, fuck it. I don't know. I don't know how to do it. Why did I drink last night? And then I got up and did open Anthony, what the fuck is wrong with me? I knew I had a podcast to do. Yeah, he embarrassing. Um, I don't know. Fucking no. Have a come over and just say listen. Um, I'm not happy. Oh, that's a great one. That's a classic. You know, like if you were a singer songwriter the second you said that the whole crowd would start applauding, recognizing the big hip.

Speaker 2:          00:56:08       Well, of all the girls I do before, you know, they all start fucking clapping. You know, if they just came out, you just did classic breakup monologues. Listen, um, I'm just not happy everyone, just that smattering of applause. You wait for it to die down. Let the orchestra come around again. She jumped back in on the one, um, match. Tell you're not happy. I'm not happy anymore. And Dude, let me tell you something. Her being depressed is not your fucking problem. Alright? Her being depressed is the fucking problem. How can you do this to me? What do you mean? How can I do this to you? You don't want be wars. If I fucking stayed with you and I didn't love you, I don't love you anymore. I don't love you. Depressed whore.

Speaker 2:          00:56:51       I just called you a whore as a generic term. You know, I don't, I'm, I'm not happy I want out, okay? I just feel like I want to be single right now. I just don't feel like I'm going to be with you in long haul. Uh, we'll just be wasting each other's time. My time is important and so is yours. All right? I don't want to go anymore, but I'll tell you what. If you go to stamps.com they'll give you $55 free stamps at a scale. That's what you do. Just tag every mean thing you say with all the advertising. You know, if you go to amazon.com through bill burrows website, you know, click on the Little Amazon banner, whatever you buy, you know, portion of that money goes back to bill burn and then the percentage of that goes to the wounded warrior project. So I know I'm breaking up with you right now, but you could, we could also support the troops,

Speaker 7:          00:57:40       right,

Speaker 2:          00:57:42       sir? Look, there's no fucking easy way to do this. And you're going to be sitting there. How many more holidays? How many more birthdays? How many more Christmases, which is a holiday? Sorry, you always need three examples. Do you want to go through with this person? How many more times do you want to go out and rent bikes? Go to a picnic, sit there on a sunny day. Is she sitting there with that cloud over her fucking head?

Speaker 7:          00:58:04       You know,

Speaker 2:          00:58:06       dude, you know, don't do that yourself. You want to fucking people who have just wonderful human beings and they just end up with assholes. I swear to God, assholes. They look for wonderful human beings because other assholes are not going to put up with them. You know, so you need to be an asshole here at, you know, the, the how society looks as an, as an asshole. Like you're being selfish, not being selfish. All right? Choose yourself. Choose your own fucking life dumper you get on with your life.

Speaker 7:          00:58:35       You know,

Speaker 2:          00:58:36       this is what you do. You get yourself a six, a fucking Pale Ale or whatever beer you like. You stick a couple of glasses in the fucking freezer.

Speaker 7:          00:58:46       All right?

Speaker 2:          00:58:48       Like anticipation of this championship that you know you're gonna win. You know, like they did the red sox dugout when they had the champagne on ice and game six in 1986 before they had to quickly wheel it out, okay? Except you're not going to let this one go through your leg, sir. You kicking this one, right? The client and you'd taken home the fucking championship and when it's over, all you gotta be just thinking about those frosty fucking bruise in the fridge. Just think about that. Just look at the clock when she walks in. All right. Let's say she comes in at 10 past two. Just say to yourself, worst case scenario by three fucking 30, I'm going to be sitting down on this fucking couch. All right. With my goddamn phone off, drinking a couple of five or six of these things

Speaker 7:          00:59:35       and then that's it. All right. Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:59:39       And then don't fucking have a post breakup sex. Don't do that. Cause then she'll think that you're back together again. Fuck all of that. All right. Your mind just see got to come back. Yeah, my staff. Okay. When do you want to come by? This is coming off really cold. She's going to do all of that and just try to keep dragging you back into the fucking thing. Um, I dunno if this is a punk thing to do, but after you break up with her, just don't answer the phone when she calls and then she'll find, just say, listen, I gotta I gotta come by and get my stuff. Can you text her back? I fucking just be a man. What does she going to do? Body Slam you. She's just going to make you feel bad. All right.

Speaker 1:          01:00:31       [inaudible] is it you little blue? You would.

Speaker 2:          01:00:37       No, it's cause you're a mopey. You're sucking the life out of me. You know when, when you get that sad look on your face, you look like a muppet there. I said it all right. There's your shit over there in the corner. I've got a couple of cool ones in the fridge, so why don't you do me a favor. All right, get over there Ben down. Lift what you need. Get your shit and get the fuck out of here. What do you say that touch? Yep. Prince Jarman is out there somewhere.

Speaker 7:          01:01:02       You know and ain't here.

Speaker 2:          01:01:05       I'm not riding that horse anymore. Okay? I just shot it in the back of the head. It's over. Okay, so why don't you trudge on out of here? They're fucking Cinderella. Go look in a mirror. Go climb up in a tower and fucking drop your hair out. Whatever the fuck you supposed to do. Kiss a frog.

Speaker 7:          01:01:20       All right. I got drinking to do, but I don't want to bait it. Something like that.

Speaker 2:          01:01:27       Like I said, all that bullshit. I said 10 past two which over by three 30 by three 30 at Busan.

Speaker 7:          01:01:33       All right. I don't know

Speaker 2:          01:01:38       now the fucking brutal breaking up to something as brutal, brutal, just awfulness at this five minute podcast.

Speaker 8:          01:01:43       But other than that [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          01:02:42       I've been all over the map politically, but it's why like, you know, certain ways of looking at shit, like when people talk about guns, like let's just make them what? Let's just make them illegal and then no, we all have them. You know, like that sort of like thought process is your, you're acting as though the world is a utopia and that there's not morons and that there's not, uh, people who say, I don't give a fuck what the rules are. You're totally not even taking into consideration sociopath, which is why that new fucking thing that Obama signed, that whole defense package where now they can just arrest people without a trial Jay and put you in jail forever with, without a trial because they just think you're a fucking terrorist. You can't give people that level of power. I'm a fucking moron. And I know you can't do that.

Speaker 2:          01:03:32       Historically, no one has ever handled that level of power. Well, anybody here want to go live in China? Now we out there practicing your nunchucks wearing your wooden slippers and all of a sudden a van pulls up and you disappear and that's it forever. You want to live there? Of course you don't. You want to live here where they can't fucking do it. Well, they can do it now. You know? They just put in a fucking order for a bunch of black fans. That's what I heard. According to Holy shit.com that's what's going down. I don't understand why stuff at that level that affects citizens to that level. Why we don't get to vote on it. Do you think it's because we'd say, Hey, you know what? Fuck that. Do you understand like that is just a jump off point. Do you think like that's just how it's going to stall as though you're not a terrorist there, you ain't going to fucking problem.

Speaker 2:          01:04:22       You think it's just going to stop with that. That's not how you take away freedom. You don't just fucking do it all in one fell swoop. It's incremental. It's just like when you're dating some fucking woman and you're not paying attention and she just gradually, every day takes another foot of real estate. Next thing you know you're in goal line d going, how the fuck did I end up in this situation? We started at the 50 little push little pole, right? Everything was fine. Next know you're up against the Golan. The you think that they're just going to keep it with the terrorist thing, you know? You know they'll wait for a whole nother generation of babies to be born and they always grew up with government having that level of power and then they add something else to it. Then they had something else. Then that's it. You can't have it. Okay. If Tiger Woods can't handle the level of free pussy on a golf tour, how the fuck is our government going to handle a new defense package, which basically gave a mute button when you love the egg, how would you handle that if you had that power, do you, how long before you just started abusing that? If you could just hit mute on anybody who ever disagreed with you and then just, and you could have them whisked away.

Speaker 7:          01:05:38       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:05:38       I mean, that is the sociopath's wet dream. That's what that is. That is a fucking mute button, Mr Style. And don't you think that's it? He hit mute. You're done. You're gone. See Ya. I think it's, it's fucking insane. And I'm, the only thing that I get out of it is that I feel like I was proven correct that I don't think it matters at that level. Whether you vote Democrat or Republican Obama, the first black president ever, you would think this would be the most liberal, uh, politician in the history of this country because of his background. You would think that he signed off on that shit.

Speaker 7:          01:06:22       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:06:23       All right. I'm telling you, I don't know what happens when you become president, but I think they let you peek just enough behind the curtain and you there, there was a fucking agenda that we are moving towards because it does, I don't think of fucking matters. I really don't, which is why I always vote for the Ralph Nater, the fucking Ron Paul, all those guys that all those fucking idiots go to cause you did that. You've ruined the election. Really? Did I? I feel like those guys wouldn't have signed shit like that. I feel like their track record shows that they would not sign shit like that. I don't know. I have no, I imagine I'm going to get a ton of fucking emails. I'm almost, somebody was yelling at me one time saying that because I voted for Ralph Nader in 2000 that's why George W. Bush won and they was just going on and on and on about it. And I was like, dude, I live in New York. Al Gore won my state. Okay. Do you understand that? So your whole fucking theory right now is out the window. I voted for Ralph Nader in New York and Al Gore still won the state. So go fuck yourself. What? I'm trying to do a mister fucking red and blue tie here. I'm trying to fucking encourage more people like that to vote. So mission accomplished. That's what I'm trying to fuck and have to vote to run,

Speaker 7:          01:07:49       you know

Speaker 2:          01:07:53       uncorruptible how far can you get if you're uncorruptible I would say that you could get to the uh,

Speaker 7:          01:08:01       okay.

Speaker 2:          01:08:01       Whatever level politics is when you decide whether or not they should put a gazebo in the center of town. I think beat. Once you get beyond that, you gotta you gotta be a little dirty. Right. I love talking about this shit cause it just people up, you know. Oh you know, maybe you should all read a little more before the next time you fucking own. Really. What are you reading and what are you reading? What they give you? Is that what you're reading? Fuck head. Why you acting like you have clearance to the bottom floors of the fucking Pentagon? You're guessing? Just like I am. All right, Mr. Informed. I read the pamphlet. I know by a fucking word of it. You know, you can use Coca-Cola to take rust off of metal. You can use it for that. You know, you understand that yet they're still able to sell it to us. Like it's refreshing.

Speaker 8:          01:09:01       I don't know what that point man either [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] ladies and gentlemen.
