Hi. My name is Magnus. I work with the Google Drive Team. We're going to look at the ASUS Anywhere

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.340
application, which allows you to interact
with content across many cloud storage

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:24.300
providers. And of course it has an integration with Google Drive API.  Let's have a look.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.100
ASUS Anywhere is a highly practical integrated
cloud service management tool

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.100
that brings cloud services such as ASUS Webstorage, Google Drive and SkyDrive

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.100
together with shared files on My Computer and Local Area Networks (LAN)

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:01.100
using a single interface.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.100
Today, almost all users use two to three computer devices, 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:13.100
including work and home PCs, tablet devices and cell phones.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:18.100
They may also prefer certain cloud services as a result of using different platforms.

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:23.900
Using ASUS Anywhere to bring all these files together,

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.900
as well as the ability to search using keywords, helps users to find the files they are looking for.

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:35.900
The biggest advantage of using cloud services is the ability to get at the files you want anywhere, anytime.

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:42.000
From the developer’s standpoint, the important thing is the seamless user experience.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:50.000
For example, when Google Docs is integrated with Google Drive and ASUS Anywhere,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:57.000
you can go online to edit and share files, as well as manage them on your own computer.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Our goal is for users to get a great user experience when they buy ASUS products, 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.000
and it is for this reason that software services from multiple companies, including ASUS, Google and Microsoft, were brought in.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.000
If we compare Google Drive, ASUS Cloud and Skydrive, all three services offer a comprehensive range of functions,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
support a wide variety of platforms, 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
and perform well in terms of online file searches, downloads and uploads.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
If you talk about which company’s “drive” is the best,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.500
I believe that each has its own strengths.

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.000
But if you’re talking about Google Drive in terms of development, it has the following advantages:

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.500
1. Ease of integration:

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:45.000
Development using RESTful APIs makes it easier for developers to integrate Metro apps with Google Drive.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.000
2. High execution performance: API execution performance is good.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.500
3. Supports a complete range of features: Supports all the features that drives need.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:08.000
4. Clear documentation and instructions: API documentation is comprehensive and easy for developers to read.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Integrating the Anywhere software using the Google Drive RESTful API is very convenient,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.500
and the comprehensiveness of the features provided by Google Drive is excellent.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.000
So integrating Anywhere with Google Drive 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:27.000
results in very few issues, just as with other drive services, and the API documentation is extremely clear.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
In future, we hope that Google will provide functionality to support

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.800
streaming playback on the MS metro app built-in player.

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.000
Google has a diverse range of APIs,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000
but at this point we would particularly like to recommend the Google Geo Coding API,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
some of the features of which are used in Anywhere strong search,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000
mainly its ability to translate GPS locations into geographical locations, which is really powerful.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000
For example, if the GPS coordinates of a photo are 22°N and 120°E,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:03.000
the Google Geo Coding API is able to convert these coordinates into the Sinsing District in the city of Kaohsiung, Taiwan.
