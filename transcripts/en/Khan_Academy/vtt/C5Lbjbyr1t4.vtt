00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:03.790
I was just looking on the
discussion boards on the Khan

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:08.150
Academy Facebook page, and Bud
Denny put up this problem,

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:09.335
asking for it to be solved.

00:00:09.335 --> 00:00:12.010
And it seems like a problem
of general interest.

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:18.510
If the indefinite integral of
2 to the natural log of x

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.200
over, everything over x, dx.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.210
And on the message board, Abhi
Khanna also put up a solution,

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.110
and it is the correct solution,
but I thought this was of

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:32.080
general interest, so I'll
make a quick video on it.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.420
So the first thing when you see
an integral like this, is you

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.635
say, hey, you know, I have this
natural log of x up in

00:00:36.635 --> 00:00:40.150
the numerator, and
where do I start?

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.150
And the first thing that should
maybe pop out at you, is that

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:49.370
this is the same thing as the
integral of one over x times 2

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.870
to the natural log of x, dx.

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.580
And so you have an expression
here, or it's kind of part of

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.640
our larger function, and you
have its derivative, right?

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.570
We know that the derivative,
let me write it over here, we

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.260
know that the derivative with
respect to x of the natural

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.870
log of x is equal to 1/x.

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:13.870
So we have some expression, and
we have its derivative, which

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:15.980
tells us that we can
use substitution.

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.250
Sometimes you can do in your
head, but this problem, it's

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:19.690
still not trivial to
do in your head.

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:21.130
So let's make the substitution.

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.570
Let's substitute this
right here with a u.

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.710
So let's do that.

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.890
So if you define u, and it
doesn't have to be u, it's

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.670
just, that's the convention,
it's called u-substitution, it

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.120
could have been s-substitution
for all we care.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.760
Let's say u is equal to the
natural log of x, and then du

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.400
dx, the derivative of u with
respect to x, of course

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.220
is equal to 1/x.

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.480
Or, just the differential du,
if we just multiply both sides

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.600
by dx is equal to 1 over x dx.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.080
So let's make our substitution.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.990
This is our integral.

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.160
So this will be equal to the
indefinite integral, or the

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:05.480
antiderivative, of 2 to the
now u, so 2 to the u,

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.450
times 1 over x dx.

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.620
Now what is 1 over x dx?

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:11.440
That's just du.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.860
So this term times that
term is just our du.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.540
Let me do it in a
different color.

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.380
1 over x times dx is
just equal to du.

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.530
That's just equal to that
thing, right there.

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.630
Now, this still doesn't look
like an easy integral, although

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.230
it's gotten simplified
a good bit.

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.000
And to solve, you know,
whenever I see the variable

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.710
that I'm integrating against
in the exponent, you know,

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:38.570
we don't have any easy
exponent rules here.

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:42.710
The only thing that I'm
familiar with, where I have my

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:45.910
x or my variable that I'm
integrating against in

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.430
my exponent, is the
case of e to the x.

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.990
We know that the integral of
e to the x, dx, is equal

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.090
to e to the x plus c.

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.470
So if I could somehow turn this
into some variation of e to the

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.370
x, maybe, or e to the u, maybe
I can make this integral a

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:03.980
little bit more tractable.

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:04.600
So let's see.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:10.890
How can we redefine
this right here?

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.380
Well, 2, 2 is equal to what?

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:19.970
2 is the same thing as e to
the natural log of 2, right?

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.850
The natural log of 2 is
the power you have to

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:26.860
raise e to to get 2.

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.620
So if you raise e to
that power, you're, of

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:29.410
course going to get 2.

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.030
This is actually the definition
of really, the natural log.

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.490
You raise e to the natural log
of 2, you're going to get 2.

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:38.180
So let's rewrite this, using
this-- I guess we could call

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.650
this this rewrite or-- I
don't want to call it

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:41.380
quite a substitution.

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.440
It's just a different way
of writing the number 2.

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.940
So this will be equal to,
instead of writing the number

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:53.260
2, I could write e to
the natural log of 2.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:58.090
And all of that to the u du.

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.120
And now what is this equal to?

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.690
Well, if I take something to an
exponent, and then to another

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:05.420
exponent, this is the same
thing as taking my base to the

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.250
product of those exponents.

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:12.810
So this is equal to, let me
switch colors, this is equal

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:21.620
to the integral of e,
to the u, e to the, let

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:22.640
me write it this way.

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:27.660
e to the natural
log of 2 times u.

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.770
I'm just multiplying
these two exponents.

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.190
I raise something to something,
then raise it again, we know

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.170
from our exponent rules,
it's just a product of

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:35.500
those two exponents.

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.250
du.

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.810
Now, this is just a constant
factor, right here.

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.210
This could be, you know, this
could just be some number.

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.300
We could use a calculator to
figure out what this is.

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:45.720
We could set this equal to a.

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.050
But we know in general that
the integral, this is pretty

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.710
straightforward, we've
now put it in this form.

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:56.290
The antiderivative of e
to the au, du, is just

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:59.750
1 over a e to the au.

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.520
This comes from this definition
up here, and of course plus

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:03.780
c, and the chain rule.

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.975
If we take the derivative of
this, we take the derivative

00:05:05.975 --> 00:05:08.210
of the inside, which
is just going to be a.

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.510
We multiply that times the
one over a, it cancels

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.920
out, and we're just
left with e to the au.

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:14.420
So this definitely works out.

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:18.590
So the antiderivative of this
thing right here is going to be

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:24.340
equal to 1 over our a, it's
going to be 1 over our constant

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:29.640
term, 1 over the natural log of
2 times our whole

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.485
expression, e e.

00:05:32.485 --> 00:05:35.030
And I'm going to do something.

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:38.170
This is just some number times
u, so I can write it as

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:39.250
u times some number.

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:42.650
And I'm just doing that to put
in a form that might help us

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:44.050
simplify it a little bit.

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:47.270
So it's e to the u times the
natural log of 2, right?

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:48.780
All I did, is I
swapped this order.

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:50.640
I could have written this
as e to the natural

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:53.140
log of 2 times u.

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:56.590
If this an a, a times u is
the same thing as u times a.

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:58.530
Plus c.

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:01.110
So this is our answer, but we
have to kind of reverse

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:04.340
substitute before we can feel
satisfied that we've taken

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:07.300
the antiderivative
with respect to x.

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:09.680
But before I do that, let's
see if I can simplify

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:10.880
this a little bit.

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:15.550
What is, if I have, just from
our natural log properties,

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:18.450
or logarithms, a times
the natural log of b.

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:20.140
We know this is the same
thing as the natural

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:21.480
log of b to the a.

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:22.900
Let me draw a line here.

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:23.220
Right?

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:25.130
That this becomes the exponent
on whatever we're taking

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:26.620
the natural log of.

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:31.950
So u, let me write this here,
u times the natural log of

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:35.470
2, is the same thing as the
natural log of 2 to the u.

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:38.440
So we can rewrite our
antiderivative as being equal

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:42.020
to 1 over the natural log of 2,
that's just that part here,

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:46.450
times e to the, this can be
rewritten based on this

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:51.740
logarithm property, as the
natural log of 2 to the u, and

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:55.750
of course we still have
our plus c there.

00:06:55.750 --> 00:07:00.500
Now, what is e raised to the
natural log of 2 to the u?

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:03.260
The natural log of 2 to the u
is the power that you have to

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:06.960
raise e to to get to
2 to the u, right?

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:08.040
By definition!

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:11.540
So if we raise e to that power,
what are we going to get?

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:13.040
We're going to get 2 to the u.

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:17.080
So this is going to be equal to
1 over the natural log of 2.

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:20.350
This simplifies to
just 2 to the u.

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:21.220
I drew it up here.

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:24.970
The natural log a I could just
write in general terms, let

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:27.520
me do it up here, and maybe
I'm beating a dead horse.

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:30.570
But I can in general write any
number a as being equal to

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:32.890
e to the natural log of a.

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:36.230
This is the exponent you have
to raise e to to get a.

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:38.880
If you raise e to that,
you're going to get a.

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:42.420
So e to the natural log of 2 to
the u, that's just 2 to the u.

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:44.900
And then I have my
plus c, of course.

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:46.450
And now we can
reverse substitute.

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:48.830
What did we set u equal to?

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:53.060
We defined u, up here, as equal
to the natural log of x.

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:55.990
So let's just reverse
substitute right here.

00:07:55.990 --> 00:08:00.570
And so the answer to our
original equation, your answer

00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:03.260
to, let me write it here,
because it's satisfying when

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:08.950
you see it, to this kind of
fairly convoluted-looking

00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:14.730
antiderivative problem, 2 to
the natural log of x over x dx,

00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:17.815
we now find is equal to, we
just replaced u with natural

00:08:17.815 --> 00:08:21.750
log of x, because that was our
substitution, and 1 over the

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:29.410
natural log of 2 times 2 to the
natural log of x plus c.

00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:30.100
And we're done.

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:31.970
This isn't in the denominator,
the way I wrote it might

00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:33.410
look a little ambiguous.

00:08:33.410 --> 00:08:34.110
And we're done!

00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:37.340
And that was a pretty neat
problem, and so thanks

00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:39.900
to Bud for posting that.
