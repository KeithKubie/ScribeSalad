00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.320
A lot of you have wondered where, and how you even buy liquid nitrogen.

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:05.020
Where do you even get it how much does it cost

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:06.060
whats the process

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.140
so today we're gonna go buy some liquid nitrogen

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:14.740
this little baby is a 35 liter liquid nitrogen dewar

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.120
this is basically a glorified thermos

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.960
that you use for storing liquid nitrogen

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:25.440
its got a little foam riser in here that help prevent the liquid nitrogen from coming out too fast

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.680
but at the same time it's got enough air gaps that any pressure can be released

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.960
and before i this thing i used this

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.800
this actually is a thermos i pick up at Walmart for like 5 or 10 dollars

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:37.640
i can't remember what but

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.320
that's the first container they let me take liquid nitrogen in and it does work

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:42.920
Lil more  dangerous of course but

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.560
it gets the job done

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.000
we're taking this thing together today

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.760
to go get some liquid nitrogen

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.400
alright so you may be wondering why I'm driving my Weiss minivan and...

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.320
well hey its awesome and it's got lots of room and it will store my nitrogen dewar no problem

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.720
i could stick 10 foot 2 x 4's from Home Depot

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.880
so i love our minivan but...

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.640
I think it's time to get my own car

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.220
you see 3 years ago I sold my car because all I do is sit at the computer editing videos

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:13.460
so i didn't really have a need for one

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:14.840
so i sold my car

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.480
I've been using the minivan but now I'm in a position where i wanna start traveling

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.600
maybe go to see some other youtubers around the country

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.000
and just have a little more freedom to do things like this

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.780
so... I need a new car

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.260
now this is what you wanna be looking for

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.760
something that sells industrial and medical gases

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.640
they're definitely gonna have liquid nitrogen here

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.000
alright I'm just gonna run in and talk to these guys for a second

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.420
I'm cutting my time a little bit short

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.680
cuz i have to pick my boy up from school in just a little bit

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.880
so I'm just mhm... I may just drop off this dewar

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.340
and have them fill it up while I'm gone

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:44.440
but I will get back to you

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.140
I'll let you know how much it cost and all the details and transactions

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:48.680
* Cameron says something

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:49.820
I appreciate that

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.780
just a.. met Cameron here

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.400
he says he's watched some of my videos before

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.140
Cameron: Yea

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.220
and so we were just lookin up this thing

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.620
you got the spacial muff and uh

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.520
I'm not sure how do you actually measure out the amount of liquid nitrogen

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:04.920
Worker: by weight

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.180
just by weight perfect

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.400
but anyway I'm cutting this a little bit short

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.800
I gotta go pick up my kid from school

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.900
so I'm gonna come back when this is all done and we'll grab it then

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.400
ok so apparently my kids on a field trip and wouldn't be back till 12:30

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.480
so i didn't need to rush quite as quickly as I did

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.980
but...

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:20.980
since we got a little bit of time to kill

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.280
I'm gonna show you how these numbers work for the liquid nitrogen

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.180
and basically give you the rundown of how much it cost and why

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.400
alright so when you go to buy liquid nitrogen here's basically how it works

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.760
refrigerated liquid nitrogen i got 20 Liters of it which you can see is...

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.700
they charge 4 dollars and 25 cents per liter

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.380
for a total of 85 dollars

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.000
and then we have a hazmat fee here

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.840
they charge another 4.50 for

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.020
so 89.50 plus tax gives me 95.63

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.260
and thats the cost of 20 Liters liquid nitrogen

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.640
we're right on guys

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.740
I'm back at home I've got my dewar about half full of liquid nitrogen

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.780
it's not nearly as heavy you think it would be

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.920
and if we take this thing out now you can see

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.400
it definitely is vaping a little bit

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.660
somehow i just broke my tripod just by adjusting the leg

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.580
and this ball popped right out the socket

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:32.760
i didn't even know they could do that

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.160
and I'm trying to get it back in but...

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:37.840
man I'm not that strong

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.160
I might have to send this back and get a new one

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.060
you guys wanna see what the liquid nitrogen actually looks like

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:45.260
Son 1: Yea

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:46.920
K come sit on this step over here

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:48.860
heres a little bit

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:56.400
Son 1: O gosh can i step on it

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.020
it kind of looks like a cloud on the ground

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:01.520
Son 1: Dadda I wanna

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:02.660
I'm gonna do a little bit more

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:03.160
Cameraman(Woman?): K

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.620
Cameraman(Woman?): watch out for your feet and stuff guys everybody stand back

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:10.640
Cameraman(Woman?): woah

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.060
thats so cool

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.500
look is like little beads

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:15.000
Cameraman(Woman?): Yea

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.500
dripping aroud huh

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.340
Cameraman(Woman?): Thats cool

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:19.040
Boy 1: I just stepped in it

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:20.960
how to make the ground fog
