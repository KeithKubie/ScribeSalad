00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:04.830
In the words of music legend Whitney Houston
'Crack is Whack'.

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.500
But with all the extra attention lately, thanks
to Toronto Mayor Rob Ford - what exactly is

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:10.500
crack-cocaine?

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.690
Is it really as 'whack' as it's portrayed
to be?

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.500
Crack is simply another form of cocaine, which
comes from the leaves of a coca plant.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.230
After mixing powdered cocaine with a weak
base, such as baking soda, it changes composition

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.699
and a solid is produced, often referred to
as 'rocks'.

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:28.759
This solid has a much lower melting point
than cocaine (90C vs 190C) allowing it to

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:30.630
be smoked, as opposed to snorted.

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.410
In fact, it's called 'crack' because of the
sound it makes when heated.

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.620
But why smoke it?

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.350
Well, the lungs are an extremely quick and
effective way of getting something into the

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:40.350
bloodstream.

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.840
Those with asthma, for example, use inhalers
to quickly put a drug directly into their

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:45.840
system.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.239
When smoke meets the large surface area in
your lungs, it too slips right through the

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:52.809
membrane, and heads straight to your brain,
in as little as 8 seconds.

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:56.949
This is much faster and more intense than
the effects of snorted cocaine which generally

00:00:56.949 --> 00:00:59.199
takes around 10 minutes to reach the brain.

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:03.019
However, once in the brain, crack and cocaine
are effectively identical.

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:06.960
Initially, users feel energized, alert and
much more aware of their senses.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.310
In the brain, crack acts on the Ventral Tegmental
Area, releasing large amounts of dopamine

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.010
- the chemical often associated with feelings
of pleasure and euphoria.

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.040
This dopamine travels between brain cells
- called neurons - and binds to receptors

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.720
that trigger the good feelings.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:26.020
Now, normally, this dopamine would be reabsorbed
back into the neuron by a dopamine transporter;

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.670
however, crack alters this process.

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.220
It attaches to the transporter, and blocks
the reabsorption, allowing dopamine to build

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.030
up and continually stimulate the receptors.

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.340
As a result, you feel - well - really good
for around 10 minutes.

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.320
But soon after, the dopamine levels in the
brain plummet, causing an extreme low and

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.280
often feelings of depression.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.670
Which is why many users typically smoke more,
hoping to reach that high again.

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.340
Unfortunately, these dopamine levels can take
a long time to naturally replenish, contributing

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.230
to physical and psychological dependence or
addiction, as well as increased irritability,

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:02.180
restlessness and paranoia.

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.990
In some cases, crack or cocaine abuse can
lead to something called Delusional Parasitosis

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.670
- the feeling that bugs or insects are crawling
under the skin.

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.860
This often leads to self-destructive behaviour,
like scratching or biting, in an effort to

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.860
get rid of the imagined bugs.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.780
In the most serious cases, crack's impact
on the heart can cause heart attacks, strokes,

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.910
or even stop the heart altogether, leading
to death.

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.230
Simply put, on the extreme end of things,
crack can get pretty whack!

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.730
