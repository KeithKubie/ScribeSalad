00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.700
In this video,

00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.467
we're unboxing and building
our most recent kit,

00:00:03.467 --> 00:00:06.000
the Spy Scope,
used to view things up close,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.800
and uncover secret messages.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:15.280
[Music]

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.500
Guys, the new King
of Random kit is here.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:18.041
That's right.

00:00:18.041 --> 00:00:19.491
In the past,
we have shown you

00:00:19.491 --> 00:00:21.485
how to making microscope
using your cell phone,

00:00:21.485 --> 00:00:22.770
and some other little parts.

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:24.100
Well, we're happy to announce

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.447
that our new kit is everything
you need to build one of those,

00:00:27.447 --> 00:00:29.280
minus the phone itself.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.880
You have to
provide that yourself.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.400
All right, so I wasn't here for
the original microscope build,

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.400
so I want to take this part.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.640
I want to see what's inside,
and I want to put it together.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:37.300
And we've actually

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.400
gone ahead and made
a few improvements as well.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.340
So this should be
a little bit easier to assemble

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:43.700
than the original
plans I showed.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:45.580
Open it up.

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:46.400
Let's see what we've got.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.240
A block of wood.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.720
Everything I ever wanted.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.140
The finest quality.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.520
All right, 2 sheets of acrylic.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.700
Now, explain to me
why there are two.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.000
It comes with two
just as a backup.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.360
When I made the original video,

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.000
I talked about how
when you're drilling acrylic,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.060
you have to be really careful
not to break and crack the pane,

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:05.360
and that is still a worry.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.240
So I believe there's
just an extra one

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.520
in case something breaks.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.360
You can try again,
and be even more careful.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.860
Nice.

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.020
We'll also use the second piece
to score and snap off a section

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.720
of acrylic to use
as a slide holder.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.660
Here are some things,
I don't know what they are.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:19.180
Flast Light.

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.300
Okay, that makes more sense.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.840
Batteries included.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:22.720
In the original one,

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.720
we had a different
taller flashlight,

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:25.900
and we had to drill a hole

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.300
into the wood to hold it up
straight and stuff like that,

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.000
and I use that

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.760
because it was available
at Home Depot for really cheap.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.000
But we've got
these flashlights instead.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.240
They're very bright.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.000
They're easy to position.

00:01:35.012 --> 00:01:37.389
They actually have a little
sticky pad at the bottom,

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:38.308
so you can place it,

00:01:38.308 --> 00:01:40.100
and then just stick
it down to the wood,

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.453
and it's going to hold in place
right where you want it forever.

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:43.140
Awesome.

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:43.780
All of our Hardware.

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.360
We've got some bolts, some nuts,
some springs, some washers.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.200
And then, the lens itself.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.540
We have a tiny little lens.

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.040
Very tiny.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.200
Which we do not have to take out

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.400
of a cat exercising
laser pointer this time.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.960
It does come with a diagram of
how all the pieces go together.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.660
So we've got our three bolts.

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:02.877
Those are what's
holding everything up.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.560
We've got nuts
and washers throughout.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.020
We've got some springs.

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.560
That's going to hold
our slide holder just

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:10.600
where we want it.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.040
That will help us
with focusing a little bit.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.900
We need to drill some holes
into both the plastic sheets

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.017
and the wooden base,

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.300
and then we
place our flashlight.

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.200
And it does have on here,

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.580
additional tools
required for assembly:

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:23.980
a cellphone with a camera.

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.980
We've got that.

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:26.780
Drill.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.840
Drill bit, a 1-1/4
inch drill bit.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.760
And optionally, spray paint,

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.560
and that's if you want to change
the color of the whole base.

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.420
You don't need to do that,

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.360
but it can look
a little slicker if you do.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.600
We want to drill
through both acrylic sheets

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.700
and the wooden base
at the same time.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.200
That way, all of the holes are
going to be perfectly lined up.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.300
And since we're drilling
all the way through this,

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.780
we don't want to drill
into the workbench,

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.500
like I may have done
at some point in the past.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.900
So we've got just
some scrap wood underneath it.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.660
Masking tape is of course
the strongest type

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.100
of tape in the world.

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.880
&gt;&gt; Oh, wait, no, sorry.
&gt;&gt; This is undisputed.

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:59.400
Sorry.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:00.480
One of the weakest.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.660
That's what I meant.

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:02.400
But it should do
a pretty good job

00:03:02.406 --> 00:03:03.700
of holding everything in place.

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.728
All we needed to do is
keep everything aligned

00:03:05.728 --> 00:03:07.360
as we drill holes into it.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.592
Okay, we've got
the quarter inch drill bit,

00:03:08.592 --> 00:03:09.600
and we need to drill one,

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.715
two, three holes
through all the acrylic

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.380
and the wooden base.

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.050
And the one thing we
really need to make sure is

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:16.300
that we have enough space

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.240
in between these two
to fit our cell phone.

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.580
We want the camera
to be somewhere

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.720
above this smaller rectangle.

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:24.280
Okay.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.680
And we want to make sure we have
enough space on the sides

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.500
that the phone fits nicely
in between the to.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:29.760
When drilling acrylic,

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.520
you want to put
very little pressure,

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.260
and just very carefully
drill down through it.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.480
If you've got too much pressure,

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.700
it's really likely to drill
through a lot of it,

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:39.980
and then at the back,

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:41.460
when the acrylic sheet
gets really thin--

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:42.360
It's gonna snap.

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.740
It pushes through and snaps.

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:44.860
So that's the second reason

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.500
that we've got things
stacked up like this.

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.853
It does help with alignment,
but it also really helps

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:50.720
with not pushing out the back.

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.300
When the piece of acrylic
is pushed up against something else,

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.200
the drill bit isn't going
to shove right through

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.220
and break it.

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.900
Hopefully, this will

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:58.700
stop anything from
cracking and breaking.

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.500
But just in case,
we do have another sheet.

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:03.100
Let's see how this goes.

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.760
Oh, we're into the wood.

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.940
And it just keep going
all the way down through.

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:10.200
Got it.

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.040
Is this good?

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.740
I didn't hear any cracking
or anything like that.

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:14.800
So I think that worked great.

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.140
That's all the way through.

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:21.660
Got it.

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.540
[Music]

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:26.380
I think we're good.

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:27.476
I think we can take
the tape off,

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.860
and hopefully, all of our
acrylic sheets are uncracked.

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:32.260
All right, I think
this one's okay.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:33.200
Nice.

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.940
Slight scratched,

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.240
but I don't think
it's gonna affect us any.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.260
There is one more hole that we
need to drill in this one,

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:39.600
and that's where we're going
to put the lens.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.057
Now, we're going
to take the phone,

00:04:41.057 --> 00:04:43.200
and we're going to start
a set it right in between,

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.449
trying to line the camera

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:47.120
up right in between
those two drilled holes.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.219
And now, we're going
to lift this up.

00:04:48.219 --> 00:04:49.022
Here, I'll lift it.

00:04:49.022 --> 00:04:50.077
You can marker and mark--

00:04:50.077 --> 00:04:50.500
All right.

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:51.000
There.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.100
We've got a mark.

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.700
Now, we need to drill
a hole for that as well.

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:57.280
And it needs to be
the same size as the lens.

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.980
The lens should fit
into a 1-1/4 inch hole.

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:03.300
But if you drill it too big,
then it's going to fall through,

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.860
and you're gonna have a really
hard time getting into stay.

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.180
I think we'll still use
the 1-1/4 inch hole,

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:09.600
and then if it's not fitting,

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.200
we'll put the drill in
and we'll just slightly

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.200
ease it around to widen
the hole just enough

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:15.580
that the lens will start to fit.

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.740
If you look at the side
of the lens,

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.360
there's going to be one side
of it that's pretty much flat.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:21.950
There's the plastic
housing goes around,

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:23.720
and there's the top of the lens.

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:24.895
This lens is flat on one side,

00:05:24.895 --> 00:05:27.300
and domed on the other,
and we want it pointing down.

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:30.660
So the dome side is looking
at what we're focusing on.

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.687
With the correct side identified,

00:05:32.687 --> 00:05:36.320
we're now going to press the lens
down into the hole that we drilled.

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.260
And I've got a piece
of paper towel under it now,

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.100
just so I don't accidentally
press the lens onto something

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:41.580
that's going to scratch it up.

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.500
[Music]

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:45.140
Perfect.

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:49.580
We now got a lens embedded
into the acrylic sheet.

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:50.700
Everything's ready
to be assembled.

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:53.038
But we should at least
customize it a little bit.

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.120
Let's paint it
before we assemble.

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.100
The instructions do say
spray paint optional.

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:59.260
We accept the option.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:11.360
[Music]

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:12.500
Fancy?

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:13.500
What was that sound again?

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.100
So for the next part
of the assembly,

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:18.020
this is pretty simple.

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:19.060
You're going to take
all of your bolts.

00:06:19.065 --> 00:06:20.800
You're going to put them up
through your base,

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.600
and just sort of layer
all of your pieces

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:23.820
as you see them.

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:25.717
Make sure that your acrylic has
the plastic remove

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.220
before you do this.

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:28.460
There's our rubber gaskets.

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:30.220
We need our washers first.

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.460
The nuts.

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:36.700
Wing nuts, upside down.

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:39.500
And Nate, you're saying

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:41.600
that we're going to be adjusting
these according to the height

00:06:41.605 --> 00:06:43.100
of where we need
them for the light.

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:47.220
[Music]

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:49.320
It disconnects if you need
to replace the batteries,

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.480
but the base stays right
where you put it.

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:56.660
[Music]

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:57.440
The phone--

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:58.400
Will be sitting on top.

00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:59.540
Right like this.

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:01.340
So you can see whatever's
on this slide.

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:02.320
Yes.

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:03.500
So we're going to be
adjusting that slide

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:06.120
up and down depending on
where we want our focus.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:07.100
All right, I think we're good.

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:08.300
What should we put on it?

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:11.500
Well, there's lots of things
that we looked at before.

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:13.140
We looked at a penny.

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:15.100
We looked at some leaf pieces.

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:16.940
But we actually
have something else.

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:18.780
This is the kit as it comes,
minus the sticker,

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:20.300
which we still need
to attach down at the bottom.

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:21.050
However, we also

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:23.700
we're going to be having
some slides you can get.

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:27.420
So we have here the slide pack
that it comes with.

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:28.860
Oh, that's fun.

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:31.940
With some cool little bits
of nature in it.

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:34.280
This is some Lotus root,

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:36.500
dandelion fuzz,

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:38.600
sponge gourd stem,

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:41.000
and pine tree stem.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.620
So in addition to these
four slides of nature,

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:45.800
we have these
additional challenge slides,

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.420
and these are
actually pretty fun.

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:50.300
Hidden within these slides
are some letters,

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:52.060
and if you find the letters,

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:53.780
you can enter them
as a promotional code

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:54.760
into our website.

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:58.400
TheKingofRandom.com/ the
unscrambled letters.

00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:59.320
It makes a phrase.

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:00.860
If you unscramble those letters,

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:02.580
plug them in and go
to the hidden web site.

00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:05.340
You can receive a bonus code
for an extra challenge.

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:06.800
Holy cow.

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:07.820
That is so cool.

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:08.460
There it is.

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:09.400
Look at that.

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:11.300
That-- Okay.
That's really just creepy.

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:12.200
But awesome.

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:15.100
Wow, Lotus root is full
of a lot of really tiny holes.

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:19.560
[Music]

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:21.120
Looks like little alien.

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:23.552
For some types of slides, or
things that you're going to look at,

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:25.580
if it has a lot of holes in it,

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:28.480
then this LED can be
a little bit intense.

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:31.400
It's pretty bright
and sharp lighting.

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:33.340
So if you want to diffuse
that a little bit,

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:35.880
it's really easy to take just
a piece of white paper towel

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:37.500
or white printer paper,

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:38.980
and just set it right
over the light.

00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:40.700
A lot of light
still gets through.

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:42.160
It's just a little bit softer.

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:44.400
We're just cutting
the pieces of plastic

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:47.320
that all of our little tools
and supplies came in.

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:50.180
Just make some really
quick makeshift slides,

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:54.100
because I want to try some
of our pen ink slime.

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:56.140
This would looked really
pretty through the lights.

00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:59.640
[Music]

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:00.500
Wait.

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:01.960
This is gonna be cool.

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:05.200
[Music]

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:06.840
That's so cool.

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:10.660
There are a lot of really
small bubbles in there.

00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:11.640
Not just bubbles though.

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:16.040
I think we're actually seeing
like tiny bits of pigmentation.

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:17.940
It looks like little Galaxy.

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:19.560
This phone is turning green.

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:20.160
I know.

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:20.660
That's weird.

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:22.200
Because we've seen purple,
we've seen green.

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:24.680
It really just depended on
how thick we made that slime.

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:26.320
But that's weird.

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:27.500
Guys, that's the kit.

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:29.960
The whole thing goes together
pretty quick and easy.

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:30.920
It works great,

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:33.080
and it should work
with pretty much any cellphone

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:34.440
that has a camera on the back.

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:35.520
This thing is really--

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:36.460
It's so fun.

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:37.760
The thing is fun.

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:39.760
It's crazy what things
look like up close.

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:40.960
So the kits' available now.

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:42.120
Click the link

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:44.240
and go to TheKingofRandom.com

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:47.440
And of course, there are also
these little bonus slides.

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:49.680
These come with some cool
cross-sections of stuff

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:52.460
that are great to look at,
along with these images.

00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:54.420
These are the ones that
have hidden letters in them.

00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:56.000
Go through, find all
the hidden letters,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.220
assemble them into a phrase,

00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:58.740
that will take you to a website

00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:00.940
where you can get even
more bonus content.

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:02.260
Should be great fun.

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:03.700
Guys, that's not all.

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:05.260
We've always got more
for you to see.

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.580
That box up at the top will take
you to our latest video,

00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:08.860
and that box at the bottom is

00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:10.600
what YouTube thinks you
should be watching next.

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:12.800
