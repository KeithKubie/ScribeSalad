(man)
Let's see your stuff, man.

00:00:04.937 --> 00:00:06.406
Oh!

00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:08.207
Yeah!

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.609
[applause]

00:00:09.642 --> 00:00:11.911
Yeah! See?

00:00:11.944 --> 00:00:15.048
- Thank you.
- That's great.

00:00:15.081 --> 00:00:16.315
Oh! Oh!

00:00:16.348 --> 00:00:17.784
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

00:00:17.817 --> 00:00:19.252
Don't fall in the street.

00:00:19.285 --> 00:00:20.253
Don't fall in the street.

00:00:20.286 --> 00:00:23.222
Oh! Man!

00:00:23.255 --> 00:00:26.726
Damn.

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:28.227
[chuckles]

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.830
I like it.

00:00:30.863 --> 00:00:32.598
[laughing]

00:00:32.631 --> 00:00:34.033
Damn, you're good!

00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:35.468
Is this guy
just now realizing

00:00:35.501 --> 00:00:37.670
black people are amazing
at stuff?

00:00:37.703 --> 00:00:41.007
That's Rico, and he's so good
at his job, he sucks at it.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.811
I have no idea which way
Gables River Oaks is.

00:00:44.844 --> 00:00:46.612
But when some honky
filmed him,

00:00:46.645 --> 00:00:49.148
he became known as the greatest
sign spinner of all time.

00:00:49.181 --> 00:00:52.018
Sign spinning is baton twirling
for boys.

00:00:52.051 --> 00:00:53.553
It was invented in Kansas

00:00:53.586 --> 00:00:56.923
when a guy wearing a sandwich
board got sucked into a tornado.

00:00:56.956 --> 00:00:58.658
The day I take my taxes
to a place

00:00:58.691 --> 00:01:00.526
because a sign spinner
pointed me there

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:02.829
is the day I go to jail.

00:01:02.862 --> 00:01:05.198
Sign spinners are the whores
of the advertising world.

00:01:05.231 --> 00:01:07.433
They work on street corners,
they're paid in cash,

00:01:07.466 --> 00:01:09.135
and the police don't ask
too many questions

00:01:09.168 --> 00:01:10.870
when they turn up dead.

00:01:10.903 --> 00:01:14.073
It's a step above Mexicans
snapping a deck of hooker cards

00:01:14.106 --> 00:01:15.608
on the Vegas strip

00:01:15.641 --> 00:01:19.145
and a step below the big wiggly
balloon guy at used car lots.

00:01:19.178 --> 00:01:21.681
Hiring a sign spinner is
a company's way of advertising

00:01:21.714 --> 00:01:23.649
that they can't afford
a billboard.

00:01:23.682 --> 00:01:25.151
In case you don't live
in a real city,

00:01:25.184 --> 00:01:27.386
billboards are the things
that tell you

00:01:27.419 --> 00:01:28.921
where the next
Cracker Barrel is.

00:01:28.954 --> 00:01:31.557
They're the spam
of the American landscape.

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.459
My biggest problem
with sign spinners is,

00:01:33.492 --> 00:01:35.027
they put up
one heck of a fight

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.131
when you try to spray-paint
a dick on their forehead.

00:01:38.164 --> 00:01:40.366
Rico is really, really good
at something

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:41.868
that is really, really dumb.

00:01:41.901 --> 00:01:43.169
That's why I flew him to L.A.,

00:01:43.202 --> 00:01:44.604
where I've never seen
a sign spinner

00:01:44.637 --> 00:01:46.105
because I'm always
too busy texting,

00:01:46.138 --> 00:01:47.907
in this week's
Ce-web-rity Profile.

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.877
[applause]

00:01:54.613 --> 00:01:55.882 align:start position:0%
Hey, I'm Rico.

00:01:55.915 --> 00:01:57.250
- Are you my driver?
- Nope.

00:01:57.283 --> 00:01:58.351 align:end position:100%
I was just told
to point you

00:01:58.384 --> 00:01:59.919 align:end position:100%
in the direction
of the SuperShuttle.

00:01:59.952 --> 00:02:03.323 align:end position:100%
Go that way,
down the third median.

00:02:04.456 --> 00:02:05.825
(woman)
Esperanza.

00:02:05.858 --> 00:02:07.860 align:start size:50% position:50%
Puerto Rico! Oh!

00:02:07.893 --> 00:02:08.928 align:start size:56% position:44%
Be right with you.

00:02:08.961 --> 00:02:10.630 align:start size:47% position:53%
Yes, you, okay.

00:02:10.663 --> 00:02:14.500 align:end position:100%
Keep this pointed left
this time.

00:02:14.533 --> 00:02:15.935
You got, like, a song
in your head?

00:02:15.968 --> 00:02:18.404
(Daniel)
Rico.

00:02:18.437 --> 00:02:19.772
Welcome to L.A.

00:02:19.805 --> 00:02:21.240
Fresh off the bus, huh?

00:02:21.273 --> 00:02:22.708
Actually, I flew here.

00:02:22.741 --> 00:02:24.677 align:start position:0%
Ooh.
Slow down, hotshot.

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:26.012 align:start position:0%
Everybody wants
to be famous.

00:02:26.045 --> 00:02:27.380
(all)
Nobody wants to do the work.

00:02:27.413 --> 00:02:28.781 align:start position:0%
Everybody wants
to be famous.

00:02:28.814 --> 00:02:31.484
(all)
Nobody wants to do the work.

00:02:31.517 --> 00:02:32.919 align:start position:0%
I know you're a big shot
in Houston,

00:02:32.952 --> 00:02:35.188 size:75% position:38%
but so is Dwight Howard,
so that's meaningless.

00:02:35.221 --> 00:02:38.691 align:start position:0%
This is L.A., city of dreams
and/or angels.

00:02:38.724 --> 00:02:41.928 align:start position:0%
Do you know how many big shots
are sign spinners here?

00:02:41.961 --> 00:02:44.030 align:end position:100%
All right, I got a lot
of questions about spinning.

00:02:44.063 --> 00:02:45.298 align:start size:41% position:59%
First of all,

00:02:45.331 --> 00:02:48.367 align:end position:100%
how much money do you make
per hour spinning?

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.536 align:start position:0%
Currently, I make
$15 an hour.

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:53.573 align:end position:100%
So how did this--this one video
become so popular?

00:02:53.606 --> 00:02:54.740 size:75% position:38%
Some dude came up to me.

00:02:54.773 --> 00:02:56.642 align:start position:0%
He was like, "Dude, like,
you're awesome.

00:02:56.675 --> 00:02:58.711 align:start position:0%
Let me--just do your thing,
you know."

00:02:58.744 --> 00:03:00.046
(man)
Let's see your stuff, man.

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:02.181
Damn!

00:03:02.214 --> 00:03:03.482 align:end position:100%
He could have been
a predator.

00:03:03.515 --> 00:03:04.984 align:end position:100%
I mean, he looks like somebody
that might want to,

00:03:05.017 --> 00:03:06.085 align:end position:100%
like, take you, like,
to his place,

00:03:06.118 --> 00:03:07.186 align:end position:100%
lock you up
in a basement...

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:08.554 align:start position:0%
Yeah.

00:03:08.587 --> 00:03:10.122 align:end position:100%
And just come down and watch
you spin signs for him.

00:03:10.155 --> 00:03:11.991 align:start position:0%
I'll use my sign as a weapon,
so it's good.

00:03:12.024 --> 00:03:14.860 align:end position:100%
Do you spin based on the music
you're listening to?

00:03:14.893 --> 00:03:16.429 align:start position:0%
Yeah. Sometimes.

00:03:16.462 --> 00:03:17.697 align:end position:100%
Do you ever, like,
listen to talk radio

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:18.864 align:start size:69% position:31%
while you're spinning?

00:03:18.897 --> 00:03:21.234 align:end position:100%
Like, Bill O'Reilly--
"No Spin Zone."

00:03:21.267 --> 00:03:24.170 align:end position:100%
Who's your favorite
blue-collar comedy star?

00:03:24.203 --> 00:03:27.073 align:end position:100%
Bill Engvall,
"Here's Your Sign."

00:03:27.106 --> 00:03:28.407
- No, I--
- That's what he says.

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.176 align:end position:100%
He always goes,
"Here's your sign."

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:31.677 align:end position:100%
It's not--
he's no one's favorite.

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:32.812 align:start size:66% position:34%
Don't worry about it.

00:03:32.845 --> 00:03:34.146 align:end position:100%
Do you ever get tipped
by people?

00:03:34.179 --> 00:03:35.348 align:start position:0%
Mm-hmm.

00:03:35.381 --> 00:03:38.017 size:84% position:42%
One time, somebody gave me,
like, $20 in all change.

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:40.019 align:end position:100%
I've done that before
to homeless people.

00:03:40.052 --> 00:03:43.055 align:end position:100%
Who are the people
most likely to tip you?

00:03:43.088 --> 00:03:46.392 align:start position:0%
Mostly white women...
with accents.

00:03:46.425 --> 00:03:48.527
- Did he tip you?
- No.

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.197 align:end position:100%
This guy basically just
forced you to work for free.

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:52.498 align:start size:75% position:25%
There's a name for that.

00:03:52.531 --> 00:03:53.733 align:start position:0%
What's the name?

00:03:53.766 --> 00:03:55.601 align:start size:25% position:75%
[laughs]

00:03:55.634 --> 00:03:56.936 align:end position:100%
What are the weirdest things
people have

00:03:56.969 --> 00:03:58.537 align:end position:100%
said or done to you
while you're working?

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:01.173 align:start position:0%
One time, I was riding
the sign like a horse.

00:04:01.206 --> 00:04:02.475 align:start size:59% position:41%
That's very sexual.

00:04:02.508 --> 00:04:05.878 align:start position:0%
Yeah, someone called in
and said, like, it's a penis.

00:04:05.911 --> 00:04:08.014 align:start position:0%
I was like, "Come on, man.
It's a horse."

00:04:08.047 --> 00:04:09.348 align:start position:0%
I said, "Yee-haw."

00:04:09.381 --> 00:04:11.017 align:end position:100%
They probably didn't hear
the "yee-haw."

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:12.018 align:start position:0%
Yeah.

00:04:12.051 --> 00:04:13.352 size:84% position:58%
They just saw you thrusting

00:04:13.385 --> 00:04:15.588 align:end position:100%
on the sidewalk
with a huge arrow

00:04:15.621 --> 00:04:17.223 align:end position:100%
coming out
between your legs.

00:04:17.256 --> 00:04:19.492 align:start position:0%
I don't know, man.
It's a trick, man.

00:04:19.525 --> 00:04:20.860 align:end position:100%
Yeah, that was
a real good trick.

00:04:20.893 --> 00:04:22.028 align:start position:0%
The pony, man.

00:04:22.061 --> 00:04:23.729
[both laughing]

00:04:23.762 --> 00:04:25.564 align:end position:100%
I used to work at Best Buy
as a kid,

00:04:25.597 --> 00:04:27.733 align:end position:100%
and I would spin the CDs
on my finger all day long.

00:04:27.766 --> 00:04:29.068 size:84% position:58%
I thought that was so cool.

00:04:29.101 --> 00:04:30.903 align:start position:0%
Then you could be
a professional sign spinner.

00:04:30.936 --> 00:04:32.972 align:end position:100%
But things would have to go
horribly wrong for me.

00:04:33.005 --> 00:04:34.507 align:start position:0%
I mean, you could do it
on the side.

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:37.376
Would you consider yourself the
Michael Jordan of sign spinning?

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:39.879 align:start position:0%
I consider myself the
Kobe Bryant of sign spinning.

00:04:39.912 --> 00:04:41.547 align:end position:100%
That's a controversial pick,
but okay.

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:42.982 align:start position:0%
Yeah, it's
'cause I'm in L.A.

00:04:43.015 --> 00:04:44.550 align:end position:100%
Oh, I thought
you were implying

00:04:44.583 --> 00:04:46.452 align:start size:47% position:53%
because you are
past your prime

00:04:46.485 --> 00:04:48.154 align:start size:50% position:50%
and just sucking
the company dry.

00:04:48.187 --> 00:04:50.256 align:start position:0%

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:52.325 align:end position:100%
Has anyone ever tried to get you
to get in their car?

00:04:52.358 --> 00:04:54.193 align:start position:0%
Yes.
It was a guy.

00:04:54.226 --> 00:04:55.328 align:start size:53% position:47%
What did he want?

00:04:55.361 --> 00:04:56.829 align:start position:0%
The PG version
of what he said is,

00:04:56.862 --> 00:04:58.497 align:start position:0%
"Are you looking
for a good time?"

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:01.667 size:88% position:56%
I was playing blackjack once
in Vegas when I was younger,

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.102 align:end position:100%
and I didn't realize it
until, like,

00:05:03.135 --> 00:05:04.670 align:end position:100%
after I left
that there was a guy there

00:05:04.703 --> 00:05:05.971 size:88% position:56%
that thought I was a hooker.

00:05:06.004 --> 00:05:07.440 size:78% position:39%
He was flirting with you?

00:05:07.473 --> 00:05:10.242
Yes, but I just thought he was
just happy when I was winning.

00:05:10.275 --> 00:05:12.478 align:end position:100%
And, like, he was, like,
patting me on the back...

00:05:12.511 --> 00:05:13.713
[both laughing]

00:05:13.746 --> 00:05:15.481 align:end position:100%
But I was kind of flattered
in a weird way.

00:05:15.514 --> 00:05:16.849 align:start size:59% position:41%
I was like, "Eh..."

00:05:16.882 --> 00:05:18.017 align:end position:100%
All right, Rico,
I'm gonna go against

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:19.552 align:end position:100%
my better judgment
and give you a shot.

00:05:19.585 --> 00:05:21.120 align:end position:100%
I'm gonna start you off
with an easy assignment.

00:05:21.153 --> 00:05:22.888
(Rico) What do we want?
(all) Yes, we do.

00:05:22.921 --> 00:05:24.824

Now you're ready
for something important.

00:05:39.538 --> 00:05:42.208

Thanks to your awesome
sign spinning,

00:05:56.488 --> 00:05:58.290
