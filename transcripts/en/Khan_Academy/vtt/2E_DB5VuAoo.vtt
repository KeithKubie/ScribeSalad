00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.690
"Let f, g, and h be
real-valued functions

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:06.760
defined on the
interval, 0 to 1."

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:08.885
And it includes the
boundaries 0 and 1.

00:00:08.885 --> 00:00:10.260
That's what the
brackets tell us.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.676
It wouldn't include
the boundaries

00:00:11.676 --> 00:00:12.840
if we have parentheses.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.400
And then they define
the functions.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.880
f of x is equal to e
to the x squared plus e

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.470
to the negative x squared.

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.670
g of x looks very
similar to f of x,

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.690
except we have this x out here
in front of the first term.

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:27.360
And then we have h of x,
which looks very similar to g

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.520
of x and f of x, except
it's got an x squared term

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:32.790
right over there.

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.420
And then they tell us,
"If a, b, and c denote,

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.520
respectively, the
absolute maximum of f, g,

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.460
and h on the interval, then?"

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.710
So a is the maximum of
f, b is the maximum of g,

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:47.319
and then c is the maximum of h.

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:48.860
And then they have
a bunch of choices

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.900
that compare the maximum values.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.360
Now, the first thing that may
or may not jump out at you,

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.705
just looking at these
equations over here-- now,

00:00:56.705 --> 00:00:59.030
we're over the interval, 0 to 1.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.587
And let's just look at
the functions themselves.

00:01:02.587 --> 00:01:04.420
Let's just look at the
functions themselves.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.590
The difference is this
one, you could view,

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.460
has a 1 coefficient out front.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.460
This has an x, and
this has an x squared.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.130
So over that interval,
how are these functions

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:16.720
going to relate?

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.760
Over that interval.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:25.030
We know that over the
interval, from 0 to 1,

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:31.460
we know that x squared is going
to be less than or equal to x,

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.650
which is going to be
less than or equal to 1.

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.720
They all equal each other
at the right interval,

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.090
at actually being equal to 1.

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.930
So this is going to
be less than this,

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:43.680
which is going to
be less than that.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.480
And these are all
positive values.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.610
And the rest of the
functions are the same.

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.970
This is the same as that,
that's the same as that.

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.210
And that is the same as that.

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:59.210
So over the interval,
we know that h of x

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:04.010
is going to be less than or
equal to g of x, which is going

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:07.820
to be less than or
equal to f of x.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.891
That just comes straight
out of, this coefficient

00:02:12.891 --> 00:02:15.140
is going to be less than or
equal to this coefficient,

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.060
which is going to be
less than or equal to 1,

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.910
over the interval.

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.390
Now with that said,
let's actually

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.705
try to figure out
the maximum values.

00:02:22.705 --> 00:02:23.580
So I'll start with f.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.430
So f of x-- let me just
tried it the boundaries.

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:36.430
f of 0 is equal to e
to the 0 squared plus e

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:37.540
to the negative 0 squared.

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.830
That's just e to the
0 plus e to the 0,

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.780
which is 1 plus 1, which is 2.

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:50.070
And then f of 1 is e to the
1, plus e to the negative 1.

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.560
This is e to the 1, or
just e, I should say,

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.130
plus e to the negative 1.

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.736
Now this is clearly larger
than that. e is 2.71

00:02:59.736 --> 00:03:00.876
and keeps going.

00:03:00.876 --> 00:03:02.250
e to the negative
1, that's still

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.980
going to be a positive
number, obviously.

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.640
So this, between
the two endpoints,

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.391
this seems to be a candidate
for the maximum point.

00:03:10.391 --> 00:03:12.890
We don't know that's the maximum
point, because the function

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.190
might have done something
funky in between.

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.690
So let me draw an axes.

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.240
I can draw a straighter
line than that.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.250
So we know at 0, we
took on the value 2,

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:32.135
and at 1, we took on the
value e plus 1 over e,

00:03:32.135 --> 00:03:33.420
or e to the negative 1.

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.440
So that's that value
right over there.

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.750
Now, we don't know what the
function did in between.

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.550
This would be the
maximum point--

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:43.930
this is the maximum point,
if the function did something

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:44.890
like this.

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.360
If it's constantly
increasing the entire time,

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.090
this would be the maximum point.

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:50.650
It would not be
the maximum point

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.670
if the function looks
something like that.

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.040
And the way we can tell
what the function is doing

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.150
is we can take the derivative
of f, which tells us

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.990
the slope at any point
over this interval.

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:05.310
And if the derivative
is constantly positive,

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.520
that means we always
have an upward slope.

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:09.442
If the derivative is
not always positive,

00:04:09.442 --> 00:04:11.150
then we have something
like this and then

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.730
we could actually look for
that actual maximum point.

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.810
So let's calculate
the derivative.

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:26.330
So f prime of x is equal to--
let's see the derivative of e

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.420
to the x squared is
2x e to the x squared,

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:30.870
just using the chain rule.

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.800
Derivative of e to
the negative x squared

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.770
is negative 2x e to
the negative x squared.

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.260
And let's see, we
could factor out--

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:51.210
this is equal to 2x e to the
negative x squared times--

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:55.360
so if you divide this by e
to the negative x squared,

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.380
that's like multiplying it
times e to the x squared.

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:07.160
So this becomes e to
the 2x squared minus 1.

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.400
Now, our question is-- this is
the slope over the interval--

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.080
what is this doing at any point?

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.260
Well, this value
right here, this right

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.270
here is always going to be
greater than or equal to 0.

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:19.115
It'll be 0 at the
left-hand interval.

00:05:19.115 --> 00:05:20.490
Just remember,
this is the slope.

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.170
The slope is 0 at the left-hand
interval, which tells us

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:25.490
it's either a maximum
or minimum point.

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:27.880
But then, it's going to
be positive after that.

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.460
Because this is going to be
a positive value, and that

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.002
this is going to be
a positive value.

00:05:32.002 --> 00:05:34.460
Remember negative exponent does
not mean a negative number.

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:35.860
It means a fractional value.

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.680
It's going be 1 over
e to the x squared.

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.150
So this is always going to be
greater than or equal to 0.

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:41.670
And so what we
need to figure out,

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:46.530
is this always greater
than or equal to 0?

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:52.110
So we want to figure out, is
e to the 2 x squared minus 1

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:55.324
greater than or equal
to 0 over the interval?

00:05:55.324 --> 00:05:56.740
Which is the same
thing as asking,

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:59.940
is e to the 2x
squared greater than

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:01.930
or equal to 1 over the interval?

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:05.030
I just added 1 to both
sides of this inequality.

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:06.530
And that's the same
thing as asking,

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:08.800
if you take the natural
log of both sides,

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:12.060
the natural log of
this is to 2x squared.

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:15.100
The natural log of 1 is 0.

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:19.550
So is 2x squared greater than
or equal to 0 over the interval?

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:20.350
Well, yeah, sure.

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:23.300
It's going to be equal
to 0 at x is equal to 0.

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.580
But then after every other
value, as it approaches 1,

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:26.920
it'll be positive.

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.670
So this is true.

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:29.760
This is true.

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:32.600
So this thing is always
going to be greater than 0

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.505
over the interval,
which tells us

00:06:34.505 --> 00:06:36.097
that the two parts
of the derivative

00:06:36.097 --> 00:06:38.180
are always going to be
greater than or equal to 0.

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:41.010
So the derivative itself,
the slope of the function,

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:43.840
is always greater than 0.

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.130
So always greater than
0-- over the interval

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:49.940
I should say-- always
greater than or equal to 0

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:55.220
over the interval from 0 to 1.

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:58.390
Which tells us that the
slope is never negative.

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:01.342
And actually, we know
that the slope is 0 at 0.

00:07:01.342 --> 00:07:03.300
So that tells us that
the graph looks something

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:09.060
like this, which tells us
that the right endpoint--

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:14.220
that f of 1, when x equals 1--
f of 1 is the maximum point.

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:21.930
So this, indeed, is equal to a.

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:24.910
So we can actually write this
here. f of x is less than

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:29.700
or equal to a.

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:33.910
Now, let's think about
h of x and g of x.

00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:36.890
So f of 1 was its maximum point.

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:41.240
But g of 1-- if you
take g of 1 or h of 1,

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:43.860
it'll evaluate to f of
1, because if you put a 1

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:45.132
here-- let's do that.

00:07:45.132 --> 00:07:46.590
Let me just do it
to make it clear.

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:52.170
So we already evaluated
f of 1 right over there.

00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:57.570
g of 1 is equal to--
let me make sure we

00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:01.430
can see the-- so the
g of 1 is equal to 1.

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:08.090
1 times e to the 1 plus
e to the negative 1.

00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:10.520
That's g of 1, which is
the same thing as f of 1.

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:12.990
So this is also equal to a.

00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:16.820
And h of 1 is the same thing.

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:21.170
So 1 times-- it's 1 squared,
which is 1, times e to the 1

00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:26.369
plus e to the negative 1,
which is also equal to a.

00:08:26.369 --> 00:08:27.910
So what do we have,
a situation here?

00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:31.935
We know that h of
x over the interval

00:08:31.935 --> 00:08:33.809
is less than or equal
to g of x, is less than

00:08:33.809 --> 00:08:36.115
or equal to f of x, which
is less than or equal to a.

00:08:36.115 --> 00:08:40.169
And actually, the only point
where they all equal each other

00:08:40.169 --> 00:08:41.770
is at x is equal to 1.

00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:46.274
If this right here
is f of x, g of x

00:08:46.274 --> 00:08:47.815
is going to look
something like this.

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:53.110
And h of x is going to
look something like this.

00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:56.670
h of x might look
something like that.

00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:58.821
And so they all finally
equal each other.

00:08:58.821 --> 00:09:00.320
The only place they
equal each other

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:02.680
is at a, which is
the maximum of f.

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:05.570
So that also has to be
the maximum of g and h,

00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:08.649
because they can both
get to that value.

00:09:08.649 --> 00:09:10.690
And they can't get to any
value higher than that.

00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:12.430
That's an upper bound on them.

00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:14.870
So this is also
equal to b-- remember

00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:17.430
b is just the maximum of g.

00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:20.800
And it's also equal to c,
which is the maximum of h.

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:23.590

equal to each other,

00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:27.598
or we can say choice D.
