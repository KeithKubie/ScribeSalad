[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:08.500
SPEAKER 1: Thank you all for
joining us this afternoon

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.570
for another Talks
at Google event.

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:13.570
We're very thrilled to have
Alison Bing from Lonely Planet

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:16.690
to speak to us today
about high-impact travel.

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:19.810
She's the author of over
45 books for Lonely Planet,

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.240
specifically for
us locally here,

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.820
the San Francisco, coastal
California ones, among others.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.580
And so she'll talk
about her experiences

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.320
writing for Lonely Planet.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.820
And when she's not
doing that, she

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.120
also helps Google out
with our Brand Studio

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.520
and works and writes for
several other publications

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.850
nationwide as well.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.981
So please join me in
welcoming Alison to Google.

00:00:39.981 --> 00:00:40.480
Thanks.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.044
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:42.044 --> 00:00:43.610
ALISON BING: Thanks, everyone.

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.370
So we're going to be
talking a little bit

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.932
today about high-impact travel.

00:00:48.932 --> 00:00:52.360
As you know, you can't--

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.790
by the time you
arrive in an airplane,

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:59.215
you already have a huge
carbon footprint to offset.

00:00:59.215 --> 00:01:03.280
And travel is more satisfying
when it's a positive exchange,

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.760
because nobody likes to be a
burden or show up empty handed.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.260
When a friend invites
you to dinner,

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.930
you just automatically
ask what you can bring,

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.180
and making that contribution
feels really good.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.340
So when you travel to
an unfamiliar place,

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.940
you don't even know who to
ask what you could bring.

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.520
Showing up with
nothing offer gets

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.050
things started on
the wrong foot.

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.260
You've already got that carbon
footprint to think about,

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.140
and it feels like a
lopsided transaction.

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.630
It's a drain on local
resources, and it feels awkward.

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.890
So to make a
positive impression,

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.720
sometimes we show up with
kind of a token gift.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.800
A San Francisco
Giants t-shirt, maybe.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.160
Three-time World Series
champions, you know?

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.820
Well, neither did my Lonely
Planet editor in London.

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.245
He was not very impressed.

00:01:58.245 --> 00:01:59.940
He was like, baseball?

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:01.280
We have cricket.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.690
So yeah.

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.900
It went over better in a
Moroccan village in the High

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.419
Atlas Mountains where
I brought a t-shirt,

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:14.430
and it was promptly torn up into
strips and woven into a rug.

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.090
So it's not what I
pictured, but you know, OK.

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.760
But it was a terrible
flop in Italy

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.540
where the horrified
Italian friend I gave it to

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.300
gave me a lecture,
saying, you need to--

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.320
Americans need to make your
t-shirts fit more tightly.

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.830
And he was like, for the
sake of humanity, you know?

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.310
Fix your fashion.

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.460
So I learned the hard way.

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.160
But you know, as a travel
writer, that's my job.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.980
I make mistakes so that you
don't have to make them.

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.140
So don't bring the t-shirts.

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.910
Bring something else.

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.400
Bring something more meaningful.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.810
Like what?

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.370
So I'm glad you asked.

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.360
First thing you can
bring is suitcase space.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.810
So travelers often pride
themselves on traveling light,

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.090
but they're missing
out on an opportunity

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.970
to connect with people
in their destination,

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.030
because carrying just a
little extra weight is

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.570
a small but tangible
act of kindness that

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.920
creates powerful bonds.

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.640
And there are two important
things you probably

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.760
have room for in your suitcase.

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.570
One is specific supplies
or in-kind donations

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.330
for a destination nonprofit.

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.930
Be sure to ask what that
nonprofit needs most.

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.050
You know, don't assume that
San Francisco Giants t-shirts

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.960
or Google swag, or whatever
you happen to have on hand

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.480
is going to be welcome,
especially if you

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.600
don't have enough to go around.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.620
This is an orphanage that
I visited in Ethiopia,

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:52.470
and definitely didn't need
San Francisco Giants t-shirts,

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:57.030
but donations were most welcome.

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.360
Last summer, when I was invited
to work on a public awareness

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.120
campaign for the Ethiopian
Midwives Association,

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.060
I asked what hospital
supplies might be helpful.

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.050
They asked me to bring
pediatric breathing tubes, which

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:13.260
are inexpensive here, but
really hard to come by there.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.630
And they're essential
to rescue newborns

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:16.744
with respiratory problems.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.930
At the time, I was
working at Apple.

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.390
And when I told colleagues
there what I was doing,

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:29.490
they wanted to send tubes too.

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.190
So I found out the maximum
number I could carry,

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.280
and I weighed my luggage
to the last ounce.

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.670
And all those tubes have
been put to use already.

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:43.080
And let me say, not one of
those was woven into a rug.

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.560
In fact, they were used by the
doctors you see in this photo.

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.470
This is a birth
ceremony that I was

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.630
invited to attend in Ethiopia.

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.130
And if I look a
little awkward, it's

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.860
because I had a
terrible cold that day,

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.600
and I was trying not
to touch anything

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.190
to make the babies sick.

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:00.810
But the doctor
said, don't worry.

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:01.940
You know, you're fine.

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.940
It'll be good for the
antibodies for the babies,

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:06.120
so there you go.

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.040
Doctors.

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:11.040
Here's something you're
probably already doing.

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:14.490
Tell colleagues and
friends where you're going,

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:16.950
and ask the people
who lived in that area

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:20.010
if you could take them
for coffee or lunch

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:21.960
to get their suggestions.

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.440
So far, that's mostly
benefiting you, right?

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.480
But at lunch, if
there's anything

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.630
they might like you to deliver
to their friends or family

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:33.540
while you're there, ask.

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:34.490
Nothing huge.

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:36.030
Just mementos.

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:38.910
Photos, letters, maybe a
birthday gift for a kid,

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:40.740
and deliver it in person.

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.560
This is a really
meaningful gesture.

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.380
Many people with family abroad
can't get away for visits

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:49.640
very often.

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:52.970
And many people are concerned
about re-entry to the US right

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:54.570
now.

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:57.420
Even if your colleague
or friend says no thanks,

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:00.030
they won't forget your kindness.

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:02.760
This is a photo
inside of a guesthouse

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.700
where I stayed in Ethiopia.

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:08.460
And these are items
that previous guests

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:09.840
had sent to the host.

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:15.070
She had a thing for baskets
and tinware and tea sets,

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:17.520
and had some from all over.

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:21.960
I brought her Benadryl because
she had allergies, and was

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:24.180
really suffering from
high pollen counts

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:24.930
while I was there.

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:28.980
And she liked the Benadryl,
and I'm invited back.

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:29.700
So that worked.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:35.230
If they do give you
a memento to deliver,

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:38.390
that's a great way to make new
friends or instant relatives

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:40.910
in an unfamiliar place.

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:43.100
When my best friend
was living in Zimbabwe,

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:46.280
a guy she was dating
visited San Francisco.

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:49.220
And he brought me a bundle
of letters from my friend

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:52.580
and a collage he had made about
a trip they took together.

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:57.500
Smart move.

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:00.800
That's one way to win the
approval of your girlfriend's

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.150
best friend.

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:03.470
They're now married.

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:05.840
And as their friend,
I had the honor

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:08.510
of being the justice of
the peace at their wedding

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:10.110
ceremony.

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:11.080
That's me right there.

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:11.580
That's them.

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:15.280
OK.

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:17.530
So your suitcase
is fully loaded.

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:18.464
Nice.

00:07:18.464 --> 00:07:19.630
Now what else can you bring?

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:24.470
Research skills.

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:26.740
So wild assumption here.

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:30.190
I'm guessing you know how to
search online, probably better

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:31.720
than anyone on the planet.

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:33.520
So I'm about to
tell you something

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.890
that you already know,
especially all you product

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:37.270
people.

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:42.400
To maximize positive impact,
you must do advance research.

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:44.590
Before you even buy
a ticket, research

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:46.630
to figure out where
you want to go,

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:48.760
where you want to stay,
what you want to eat,

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:50.140
what you want to do.

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:53.770
And use impact as a filter.

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:55.090
Protip here.

00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:59.050
Lonely Planet flags hotels,
restaurants, sites, stores,

00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:01.690
bars, and other venues
with a proven commitment

00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:03.250
to sustainability.

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:05.420
In our books, just
look for the Leaf icon.

00:08:08.481 --> 00:08:08.980
OK.

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:11.950
So maybe you don't want a
power search on your day off.

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:13.300
I get that.

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:15.940
But don't count on just
showing up and asking

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:18.400
a local for pointers.

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:21.280
In Venice, locals
often complained to me

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:24.730
that tourists were always
asking them for directions.

00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:27.430
At first, I thought
they were exaggerating

00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:29.680
until I did the math.

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:33.460
Even if every tourist asked
for directions only once,

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:38.500
each Venetian would be asked
on average three times a day.

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:41.419
And Venetian directions
are complicated.

00:08:41.419 --> 00:08:43.840
There are hundreds of
footbridges and canals.

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:49.630
It takes time to answer, and
that gets to be an imposition.

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:51.940
So I made sure our
Lonely Planet Venice

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:54.640
maps were really thorough.

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:57.010
And I also encouraged
tourists to consider getting

00:08:57.010 --> 00:09:00.280
lost part of the adventure.

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:02.680
I like to think maybe
some Venetians are

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:06.570
being asked for directions
only twice a day now.

00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:08.700
And here, you can see
some of the difficulty

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:12.180
that Google Maps is up against
with satellite imagery,

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:15.990
trying to show where
streets end in Venice.

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:20.800
But you know, we
walk those routes.

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:23.580
Also, when you do get
information from a local,

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:24.570
say thanks.

00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:28.950
Then stealthily fact
check that information.

00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:31.590
Even with the best
intentions, some locals

00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:34.460
will cheerfully give you
the wrong information.

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:36.610
Has this happened to you?

00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:38.340
OK.

00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:41.550
They assume they know all the
best places in their town,

00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:45.630
but the truth is, we get
lazy in our backyards.

00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:47.110
We're comfortable here.

00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:50.040
We can't always be tracking
sustainable restaurant

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:53.400
practices or
nonprofit initiatives,

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:56.112
especially when it's sunny out.

00:09:56.112 --> 00:10:00.220
Oh, by the way, these
guys are the proud owners

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:02.200
of a Lonely Planet Leaf icon.

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:06.950
They have practiced sustainable
fishing, support sustainable

00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:07.450
fishing.

00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:09.290
They serve exclusively
Venetian food.

00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:11.650
It's All'Arco in Venice.

00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:14.555
And that's Francesco and
his son Mateo behind him.

00:10:14.555 --> 00:10:15.380
Quite a team.

00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:19.010
I interviewed them.

00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:21.250
That's how I know their names.

00:10:21.250 --> 00:10:23.041
Otherwise, I'm
usually incognito.

00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:29.350
So I know all too
well the problem

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:34.550
of potentially overlooking
something in your own backyard.

00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:36.700
I think I know my
city of San Francisco

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:39.070
until I set out to
write the Lonely Planet

00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:40.570
guide to San Francisco.

00:10:40.570 --> 00:10:43.510
And it turns out, I know my
neighborhood pretty well,

00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:46.810
and I know the paths I
take to and from work.

00:10:46.810 --> 00:10:50.770
Everything else requires
intensive research.

00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:54.700
So I Google search like
crazy, I interview people,

00:10:54.700 --> 00:11:00.580
I visit places I uncover through
research, eavesdrop heavily.

00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:01.630
I'm listening.

00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:03.171
If you're in that
restaurant with me,

00:11:03.171 --> 00:11:05.110
I'm probably trying
to hear whether or not

00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:07.030
you're liking your food.

00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:12.060
And I ask questions of everyone
I meet at a destination.

00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:14.070
For example, recent
research indicated

00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:16.110
that many diners
were complaining

00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:20.210
about a newish restaurant
in San Francisco called Cala

00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:23.640
for adding a flat
20% service fee.

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:26.530
So I went to Cala incognito
to eat dinner there,

00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:29.220
and I asked people
there about it.

00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:32.460
My server was especially
glad I asked her directly,

00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:34.440
because it's important
to her, and she feels

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:36.560
it's been misconstrued online.

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:39.370
I hear that kind of
thing can happen.

00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:41.040
Turns out that
their fixed service

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:44.520
fee is part of a city program
to rehabilitate people

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:47.760
who have been incarcerated
for nonviolent crimes, usually

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:51.600
drug-related, ensuring a
consistent income so that they

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:54.334
can get back on their feet
and stick with substance abuse

00:11:54.334 --> 00:11:55.125
treatment programs.

00:11:57.900 --> 00:11:59.280
The story checks out.

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:03.650
So now I can eat a Cala, and I
will, because it's that good.

00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:06.780
And I can feel good
about that service fee.

00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:09.730
And I can recommend it to
you in good conscience.

00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:12.107
So you've filled
your luggage, you've

00:12:12.107 --> 00:12:13.690
done your research
to figure out where

00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:16.630
you can have an impact
without entirely leaving it up

00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:18.910
to locals to educate you.

00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:21.510
This is all good, but
there's something else

00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:22.800
you may be able to offer.

00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:31.680
A willingness to go
the extra mile or 30.

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:33.900
Every dollar you
spend in rural areas

00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:37.740
is circulated through the
community four to 10 times more

00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:39.240
than in cities.

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:42.420
This is something we discovered
when I was at Airbnb.

00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:47.340
The traveler's economic impact
in rural areas is exponential.

00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:49.870
But looking at
travel industry data,

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:52.260
we also discovered
that most people

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:56.040
don't venture more than two
hours beyond city limits.

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:02.430
That's a lost opportunity
for rural areas,

00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:05.280
but it's our loss
as travelers too.

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:07.980
We're missing out on some
really enriching experiences

00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:10.500
in absolutely beautiful places.

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:13.650
Sometimes these places are
not set up for travelers,

00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:17.070
so you have to do extra research
to find out where to stay,

00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:19.800
what to do, and what to eat.

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:21.750
This is a first
communion that we

00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:26.250
stumbled into in Copala,
Mexico, and we're

00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:27.510
invited to participate.

00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:32.220
And it's just a
few hours outside

00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:35.990
of Mazatlan, about
two and a half.

00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:38.810
And by the way, this
previous image as well,

00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:41.410
two and a half hours from Rome.

00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:43.355
It's the town of
Sorano in Tuscany.

00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:51.450
So not everybody can do
this extra bit of research,

00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:55.860
but you can, because
you are Google.

00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:56.460
So look.

00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:58.890
I'm not saying it's easy.

00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:01.770
Once I was assigned
by Lonely Planet

00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:05.290
to find sustainable tourism
options in the remote Ait

00:14:05.290 --> 00:14:09.090
Bouguemez Valley in Morocco's
High Atlas Mountains.

00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:11.760
Previous editions of
"Lonely Planet Morocco"

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:15.420
mentioned that it was a
beautiful place, ideal

00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:19.440
for hiking, but it
sounded kind of scary.

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:23.400
Roads washed out,
food could be scarce,

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:27.540
and few people spoke
European languages or Arabic.

00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:30.720
By then, I had already seen
one San Francisco Giants

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:33.510
t-shirt torn to
shreds, so I knew

00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:37.740
I had to do my
research before I came.

00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:40.800
So I hired a Tachlhit-speaking
guy from the area

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:43.200
with a four-wheel-drive
car, and together, we

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:46.890
visited villages carved
out of cliff faces.

00:14:46.890 --> 00:14:51.300
We asked people and village
elders, what do you do here?

00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:54.450
What would you like people
to know about this place?

00:14:54.450 --> 00:14:57.990
Are there talents or
skills you'd like to share?

00:14:57.990 --> 00:14:59.930
And I asked them all
the same question

00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:02.620
we're trying to answer today.

00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:05.860
If people would like to
repay your hospitality,

00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:07.060
how can they best do that?

00:15:09.970 --> 00:15:11.410
Working in this
collaborative way

00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:13.420
with villagers we
met along the valley,

00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:16.240
we were able to find ways to
support initiatives they'd

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:18.940
had in the works for years.

00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:20.890
By the time we left
the valley, there

00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:23.620
were working models in place
for an after school tea

00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:27.430
program at a center for
disabled adults in Demnate.

00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:29.800
There was a postcard
pen pal project

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:33.280
to support language acquisition
for eco-trekking guides

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:34.910
in Tabant.

00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:36.860
And there were goat
cheese tastings

00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:38.930
with the women's
goat herd collective,

00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:41.510
which they started against
the will of their parents,

00:15:41.510 --> 00:15:44.590
by the way.

00:15:44.590 --> 00:15:48.610
Six years later, these
programs are all flourishing.

00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:51.850
Travelers' financial support
and overwhelmingly positive

00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:55.210
social media posts have
helped expand accessibility

00:15:55.210 --> 00:15:57.160
for disabled people
in the valley

00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:00.700
and created new jobs
through eco travel.

00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:05.560
The women's goat cheese
cooperative has tripled in size

00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:09.730
and received international slow
food prizes for their cheese.

00:16:09.730 --> 00:16:12.250
Roads have even improved,
much to the relief

00:16:12.250 --> 00:16:13.210
of the local donkeys.

00:16:17.270 --> 00:16:20.240
And that's the thing
about sustainable travel.

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:22.190
It's not as difficult
as you might

00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:24.590
think to be a trailblazer.

00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:27.770
All I needed to do was go
a bit further out of my way

00:16:27.770 --> 00:16:31.390
and ask a few more questions
than I typically ask.

00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:34.340
And when more people go
further and ask more,

00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:36.690
we can all accomplish even more.

00:16:36.690 --> 00:16:39.010
It's exponential.

00:16:39.010 --> 00:16:41.020
Here's how I know that.

00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:44.050
Last time I was in Morocco,
I ran a work session

00:16:44.050 --> 00:16:46.180
with Peace Corps
volunteers to identify

00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:50.320
ways to involve travelers in
local development efforts.

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:52.570
They brought it back to
their communities who

00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:54.580
held their own work sessions.

00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:57.730
Morocco is also the biggest
Peace Corps site in the Middle

00:16:57.730 --> 00:17:00.190
East, and that
information has now

00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:02.740
been shared with sites
across the Middle East.

00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:07.859
I also got a lot out of it.

00:17:07.859 --> 00:17:10.650
Turns out that sustainable
travel road trips are

00:17:10.650 --> 00:17:14.130
totally bonding experiences.

00:17:14.130 --> 00:17:16.530
Mohamed Nour, the colleague
who accompanied me

00:17:16.530 --> 00:17:21.420
as a driver and translator, is
now a friend of mine for life.

00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:23.310
And as the result
of our travels,

00:17:23.310 --> 00:17:25.890
he's moved to the
Ait Bouguemez Valley.

00:17:25.890 --> 00:17:28.260
He's started his own
eco travel business,

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:32.070
and now trains and
mentors eco travel guides.

00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:34.670
Like I said, exponential impact.

00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:38.480
OK.

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:40.790
So now you've got
a full suitcase.

00:17:40.790 --> 00:17:42.800
You've done your
research on impact.

00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:45.320
You're ready to go
further and ask more.

00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:46.670
Excellent.

00:17:46.670 --> 00:17:50.920
I can almost feel your
exponential impact coming.

00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:52.040
Almost.

00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:57.100
There is one more thing
you can bring with you.

00:17:57.100 --> 00:18:02.660
A passion or a belief
that transcends borders.

00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:06.290
This could be a big idea like
net neutrality or refugee

00:18:06.290 --> 00:18:10.520
support or a vision to
end human trafficking.

00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:14.800
That guy on the lower left is
my Google Brand Studio colleague

00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:17.420
Ruben Santa-- hi, Ruben--

00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:19.910
who joined a team of
eight Googlers in Nepal

00:18:19.910 --> 00:18:22.940
for a 20% project
with effect.org

00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:25.280
to fight human trafficking.

00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:29.240
They met with girls in safe
houses who had escaped slavery

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:32.930
and are now studying,
learning vocational skills,

00:18:32.930 --> 00:18:36.020
and becoming advocates for
girls still in captivity.

00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:42.120
Ruben and the Google team
use their everyday problem

00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:44.730
solving skills to
support some of the NGOs

00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:46.230
making an impact on the ground.

00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:52.020
I asked Ruben to describe
the impact of the trip on him

00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:55.410
personally, and he answered
me with this photo.

00:18:59.670 --> 00:19:02.450
Another Google Brand
Studio coworker, Ryan Chen,

00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:04.610
just came back
from a 20% project

00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:08.300
with NetHope, an organization
that sets up Wi-Fi

00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:11.510
at refugee camps in Greece.

00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:15.230
This is a camp inside
a departure hall

00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:17.225
in Greece for Afghan refugees.

00:19:22.030 --> 00:19:26.020
Between interviewing refugees,
he would decompress by drawing.

00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:27.910
People started looking
over his shoulder

00:19:27.910 --> 00:19:31.867
and asking if he
would draw them.

00:19:31.867 --> 00:19:32.950
That's Ryan in the middle.

00:19:36.090 --> 00:19:37.730
So he started
sharing his pictures

00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:39.650
with the people
around him, people

00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:44.480
living in tents who had almost
nothing, but they had rations.

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:47.000
And because it's human
nature to reciprocate,

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.220
he was invited for tea.

00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:52.280
So Ryan drew even more
pictures, and his host

00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:55.010
shared even more of
their stories with him.

00:19:55.010 --> 00:19:58.560
And this is Mustafa holding
one of Ryan's drawings.

00:20:02.490 --> 00:20:05.570
Ryan graciously allowed me
to share some of his pictures

00:20:05.570 --> 00:20:08.330
with you today so that
you can start to get

00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:10.790
to know refugees as he did.

00:20:10.790 --> 00:20:13.850
And maybe some of you will
want to volunteer with NetHope

00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:17.000
and install more routers
in more refugee camps.

00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:25.510
I wish I could draw
like Ryan, but I can't.

00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:29.270
My passions are
simpler, like corn.

00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:32.360
I was raised in a corn-growing
country in Indiana,

00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:34.610
and two big upsides of
humid Hoosier summers

00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:38.390
were, one, diving into
limestone quarry pools,

00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:41.280
and two, corn on the cob.

00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:44.640
Turns out quarry jumping is kind
of dangerous and technically

00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:49.230
illegal, and tasty corn
is getting harder to find.

00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:52.290
In the 1980s, most
farms in my county

00:20:52.290 --> 00:20:55.620
were bought out by agribusiness,
and now the corn in my county

00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:59.050
is the kind used for cattle feed
and those compostable takeout

00:20:59.050 --> 00:20:59.550
boxes.

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:07.460
But when harvest time comes
around, I still crave corn.

00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:10.010
So I did my research to
find out where farmers still

00:21:10.010 --> 00:21:13.970
grow tasty heirloom corn
like the kind I ate as a kid.

00:21:13.970 --> 00:21:18.860
The answer Google gave
me, Oaxaca, Mexico.

00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:19.512
OK, Google.

00:21:19.512 --> 00:21:20.720
So how do I get to that corn?

00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:26.300
Turns out Global Exchange
was organizing a trip

00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:28.970
to Oaxaca for Day of the Dead.

00:21:28.970 --> 00:21:30.590
I don't go for organized trips.

00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:33.580
It's my job to organize
other people's trips.

00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:36.230
But Global Exchange
does fantastic research

00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:39.170
tracking food
justice initiatives.

00:21:39.170 --> 00:21:41.780
The itinerary they
suggested included visits

00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:45.980
to a taqueria that exclusively
uses rare varietals of corn.

00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:49.590
They have 33 different
corns on that menu.

00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:51.830
And this is an image
from Day of the Dead.

00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:54.800
This young woman is dressed
in a dress made entirely

00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:58.014
of corn husks and corn kernels.

00:21:58.014 --> 00:21:59.680
You can see some of
the different colors

00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:04.605
of the heirloom corn
that is grown in Oaxaca.

00:22:04.605 --> 00:22:06.800
But even more
importantly, the trip

00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:12.950
introduced me to Zapotec farmers
who started seed corn banking

00:22:12.950 --> 00:22:15.710
to preserve heirloom varietals.

00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:19.310
When I got a whiff of that
corn cooking, I thought, yeah.

00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:19.850
I get it.

00:22:19.850 --> 00:22:22.580
This is food worth
fighting for, and this

00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:25.710
is food worth saving
for future generations.

00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:27.500
So thank you, Google.

00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:30.020
I finally found that
corn I've been craving,

00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:31.805
but I also found
my new food heroes.

00:22:35.050 --> 00:22:37.390
Now back to you.

00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:40.150
Already you have a full
suitcase, solid background

00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:44.050
research on sustainable travel,
an itinerary with a rural area

00:22:44.050 --> 00:22:46.330
where you're planning
to ask bonus questions,

00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:48.460
and a passion you're
ready to pursue

00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:50.560
to the ends of the Earth.

00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:54.160
But there is one last
thing you can share,

00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:56.120
the thing that Google
shares every day.

00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:01.070
You know this one.

00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:03.350
Information.

00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:05.135
This is an Italian muralist.

00:23:05.135 --> 00:23:08.320
It says, "Let's all
give each other a hand."

00:23:11.290 --> 00:23:13.750
So as part of the application
to join that Global Exchange

00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:15.460
trip to Oaxaca,
they asked me what

00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:18.110
I was going to do with
the information I gathered

00:23:18.110 --> 00:23:20.052
and stories I heard.

00:23:20.052 --> 00:23:22.450
Well, here I am,
telling you about it.

00:23:22.450 --> 00:23:26.590
So that's one promise
I've kept today.

00:23:26.590 --> 00:23:29.110
But there are other ways
to circulate information.

00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:30.510
You know the drill.

00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:36.010
Write posts, host Wikipedia hack
days to correct misinformation,

00:23:36.010 --> 00:23:38.590
and add to our global
knowledge about remote places

00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:43.270
that may not have access to
information sharing directly.

00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:45.490
Ruben put together this
crowdfunding campaign

00:23:45.490 --> 00:23:49.930
for effect.org, and he
whizzed past his goal.

00:23:49.930 --> 00:23:52.330
But-- I promised
him I'd say this--

00:23:52.330 --> 00:23:56.290
you can still donate and
volunteer with effect.org.

00:23:56.290 --> 00:23:58.770
So Ruben, that's another
promise I've kept today.

00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:04.810
Or you can do what
Ryan did and volunteer

00:24:04.810 --> 00:24:07.850
to install Wi-Fi for
people who really need it.

00:24:07.850 --> 00:24:11.770
This boy drew his family a house
with the crayons Ryan brought.

00:24:11.770 --> 00:24:16.870
Notice it has a NetHope
Wi-Fi access point.

00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:19.660
Join networks with
the people you meet.

00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:21.580
Widen the circle to
make room for people

00:24:21.580 --> 00:24:24.280
to be heard and get
to know each other.

00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:27.970
You'll learn stuff, including
some really random facts

00:24:27.970 --> 00:24:30.825
about breathing tubes
and goat cheese,

00:24:30.825 --> 00:24:32.200
and you'll make
friends for life.

00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:38.390
And one day, after
all this travel,

00:24:38.390 --> 00:24:41.210
you may be invited to hang
out with people whose work

00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:44.190
you sincerely admire,
people you've been

00:24:44.190 --> 00:24:47.010
meaning to thank for a while.

00:24:47.010 --> 00:24:49.320
And you won't have to
show up empty handed

00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:52.740
or wind up bringing
t-shirts no one wants.

00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:54.870
You'll have some information
they might actually

00:24:54.870 --> 00:24:58.140
be able to use to help them
make their next trip more

00:24:58.140 --> 00:24:59.760
meaningful.

00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:01.450
This just happened to me.

00:25:01.450 --> 00:25:03.710
Next time, it's your turn.

00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:05.700
Well Let's make
this exponential.

00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:10.230
One last thing.

00:25:10.230 --> 00:25:13.650
I'm headed to Uganda next month
to work on a cervical cancer

00:25:13.650 --> 00:25:15.220
awareness campaign.

00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:18.600
So if you have family
or friends in Uganda,

00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:21.810
I'd like to take
you out for lunch.

00:25:21.810 --> 00:25:24.270
And when I offer to deliver
a memento to your friends

00:25:24.270 --> 00:25:27.780
and family in Uganda,
you know I mean it.

00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:29.096
Thank you.

00:25:29.096 --> 00:25:33.488
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:34.192 --> 00:25:36.150
SPEAKER 1: Tying with
the message that you said

00:25:36.150 --> 00:25:38.160
and how it relates to the
creation of the books,

00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:41.910
you know, the idea to go one--
you know, 10 extra miles down

00:25:41.910 --> 00:25:46.830
the road, how do you balance
that with now everybody's

00:25:46.830 --> 00:25:48.390
going 10 extra
miles down the road,

00:25:48.390 --> 00:25:52.680
and they're all selling
specialty heirloom corn?

00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:57.720
And how do you not overwhelm
and keep pushing the frontiers

00:25:57.720 --> 00:25:59.920
when you suggest that
people go places?

00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:02.310
ALISON BING: Well, the other
part of that going further

00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:04.140
is asking more, right?

00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:07.530
So you don't just
go for the corn.

00:26:07.530 --> 00:26:11.655
You meet the farmers, and
then you ask the farmers,

00:26:11.655 --> 00:26:13.650
what else is happening
in the communities?

00:26:13.650 --> 00:26:16.980
And suddenly, some of the
slides I didn't put in here,

00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:19.680
they say, well, you know,
I like to do woodwork

00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:20.880
in my spare time.

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:22.020
Oh, do you now?

00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:25.650
And it turns out that the
farmers in this village where I

00:26:25.650 --> 00:26:28.590
went for the corn--
let's be honest--

00:26:28.590 --> 00:26:32.940
have fantastic-- I
mean, it's a surprise--

00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:36.940
it's not sort of UNESCO
claimed or preserved.

00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:38.640
It's just a matter
of time, really.

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:42.444
But farmers have been
doing woodworking

00:26:42.444 --> 00:26:43.860
in that area for
hundreds of years

00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:46.230
now and donating it
to the local church.

00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:49.500
So the woodworking
is splendid, right?

00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:51.504
So you just keep
asking more people.

00:26:51.504 --> 00:26:52.170
And you say, oh.

00:26:52.170 --> 00:26:54.720
Well, is anybody else
making interesting food

00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:57.180
or doing something interesting
in their spare time?

00:26:57.180 --> 00:26:59.221
And they will point you
towards the next village,

00:26:59.221 --> 00:27:01.200
and they will point you
towards their cousin

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:04.200
across the valley who makes
this really interesting corn

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:09.630
drink, fermented, that's more
powerful than you expect.

00:27:09.630 --> 00:27:10.920
[LAUGH]

00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:13.500
That was tasty, but strong.

00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:14.160
So yeah.

00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:15.600
Just keep continuing.

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:19.440
Use your curiosity to keep
pushing past the limits.

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:23.400
And certainly it doesn't take
a journalistic background

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:24.780
to do that.

00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:27.945
It just takes your
sort of natural--

00:27:27.945 --> 00:27:30.780
the curiosity that
you apply every day at

00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:34.652
work here to your travel.

00:27:34.652 --> 00:27:36.110
AUDIENCE: Thank
you for presenting.

00:27:36.110 --> 00:27:38.318
It's great to hear your
information and how to do it.

00:27:38.318 --> 00:27:39.290
ALISON BING: Thank you.

00:27:39.290 --> 00:27:42.640
AUDIENCE: How do you manage
the language barriers

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:45.610
or differences to really
getting in and understanding

00:27:45.610 --> 00:27:49.300
the culture and meeting the
people who may not speak

00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:50.830
the languages that you do?

00:27:50.830 --> 00:27:52.180
ALISON BING: Yeah.

00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:56.410
So it is helpful to do some
language learning before you

00:27:56.410 --> 00:27:58.060
go if you can,
especially if you know

00:27:58.060 --> 00:27:59.950
you're going to be
going to remote areas.

00:27:59.950 --> 00:28:02.320
But there's nothing
preventing anyone

00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:05.900
from hiring a local
translator or guide.

00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:08.710
I mean, there are
fixers who are used

00:28:08.710 --> 00:28:11.140
to this kind of thing
who you can hire

00:28:11.140 --> 00:28:15.070
as an independent traveler.

00:28:15.070 --> 00:28:18.610
I just lucked out that
when I was referred

00:28:18.610 --> 00:28:23.770
to a series of
translators, somebody

00:28:23.770 --> 00:28:26.770
said, well, this guy is
really more of a geologist.

00:28:26.770 --> 00:28:28.380
And I said, aha.

00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:33.070
Because I knew the area
that we were going to

00:28:33.070 --> 00:28:39.700
is known for having
prehistoric fossil sites,

00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:42.580
and I knew that I
would want to see

00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:44.530
what other types
of information I

00:28:44.530 --> 00:28:46.810
could get out of him
as a local expert.

00:28:46.810 --> 00:28:49.300
So it's trying to find--

00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:50.980
trying to see if
you can double up.

00:28:50.980 --> 00:28:55.060
Can the person who's taking
you someplace also provide you

00:28:55.060 --> 00:28:56.950
with some additional
language learning?

00:28:56.950 --> 00:28:59.080
Do they have insights
from their own interests

00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:01.960
or careers or
background that they can

00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:05.020
bring to that story for you?

00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:07.090
And also, you know,
again, because you

00:29:07.090 --> 00:29:09.410
don't want to rely on
locals to give you all

00:29:09.410 --> 00:29:12.160
this information, triangulate.

00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:16.900
See if you can make connections
with places that you're going.

00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:18.190
So instead of saying, OK.

00:29:18.190 --> 00:29:20.710
Take me to wherever's
important, and then somebody

00:29:20.710 --> 00:29:24.220
takes you just to the one
famous mosque in town,

00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:28.430
and meanwhile, you're passing
right by this phenomenal school

00:29:28.430 --> 00:29:33.685
in Demnate where adults are
doing vocational training

00:29:33.685 --> 00:29:37.300
and lifelong learning, and
offering tea to passers by,

00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:38.170
you know?

00:29:38.170 --> 00:29:45.190
So don't leave it entirely
up to your local expert,

00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:48.010
but try to make
some local contacts

00:29:48.010 --> 00:29:51.060
and find some information
about where you're headed.

00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:52.930
Demnate, it also
turns out, in addition

00:29:52.930 --> 00:29:56.020
to having this
phenomenal school,

00:29:56.020 --> 00:30:00.380
it is renowned for its olive
oil and a particular type

00:30:00.380 --> 00:30:03.070
of couscous, which
remains to this day--

00:30:03.070 --> 00:30:05.220
like, I dream about
that couscous.

00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:06.040
[LAUGH]

00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:11.110
So if you do your own kind
of background research,

00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:13.540
historical research, you
may come across things

00:30:13.540 --> 00:30:16.380
that even locals don't know.

00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:17.780
Yep?

00:30:17.780 --> 00:30:19.508
AUDIENCE: One last
question then.

00:30:19.508 --> 00:30:22.595
So what determines
something that you

00:30:22.595 --> 00:30:25.112
choose to put in the
guidebook or to leaving out

00:30:25.112 --> 00:30:25.820
of the guidebook?

00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:27.200
ALISON BING: Mm-hmm.

00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:31.170
Well, we do consider paths also.

00:30:31.170 --> 00:30:34.910
We're aware, particularly
in destinations like Morocco

00:30:34.910 --> 00:30:37.070
where people can be--

00:30:37.070 --> 00:30:40.160
depend on a guidebook
a lot, because it's

00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:42.500
a key source of information.

00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:45.680
San Francisco, there's a lot of
information available readily

00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:46.820
online.

00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:50.885
Not so much in the kind of outer
reaches of the Sahara Desert.

00:30:53.570 --> 00:30:57.620
But you have to be
mindful as a travel writer

00:30:57.620 --> 00:31:02.300
to constantly be
checking and shifting so

00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:06.470
that, one, you're not enriching
the one merchant in town who

00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:08.620
happens to sell water
who's in the book.

00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:11.750
So is somebody else also
selling water, you know?

00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:12.890
Probably.

00:31:12.890 --> 00:31:18.110
Can you say, oh, along
this particular block,

00:31:18.110 --> 00:31:20.900
there are several
people who sell water.

00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:27.235
So you want to be mindful of
not having an undue impact

00:31:27.235 --> 00:31:29.520
on a remote community.

00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:32.410
And again, like, continuing
every time to check.

00:31:32.410 --> 00:31:33.500
See what's going on.

00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:36.650
See how that money
is being spent.

00:31:36.650 --> 00:31:40.580
Is it being-- is the
community seeing the benefit?

00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:44.780
Or is it really just
that one water seller?

00:31:44.780 --> 00:31:48.050
There's a story in Morocco.

00:31:48.050 --> 00:31:51.740
There is an oasis
that gets bypassed

00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:53.840
because it's not along--

00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:57.140
you know, a side road was
built. A bigger road was built.

00:31:57.140 --> 00:31:59.960
And so now this town
that has a big historic

00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:03.360
[? agdez ?] has been
completely bypassed.

00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:05.555
And I thought, hmm.

00:32:05.555 --> 00:32:08.030
I want to find out
what's going on there.

00:32:08.030 --> 00:32:09.080
[LAUGH]

00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:13.010
And I had done some
research with nonprofits,

00:32:13.010 --> 00:32:15.020
and they said, yeah,
there's a community

00:32:15.020 --> 00:32:16.830
garden that's opened up there.

00:32:16.830 --> 00:32:19.920
I'm not really sure what
they're up to, but you know,

00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:21.320
if you like gardens--

00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:25.660
and I knew that
English folks who

00:32:25.660 --> 00:32:28.730
are a big audience for
Lonely Planet guidebooks

00:32:28.730 --> 00:32:30.770
are really passionate
about gardening.

00:32:30.770 --> 00:32:32.840
I thought, I'd better
check out the garden.

00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:35.990
So I went, and it turns out
that it's a communally organized

00:32:35.990 --> 00:32:40.100
garden that was started
by some schoolteachers who

00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:43.940
noticed that kids were
falling asleep in class

00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:47.390
and were not growing very much.

00:32:47.390 --> 00:32:51.980
And they realized that it
connected with malnourishment.

00:32:51.980 --> 00:32:55.670
They weren't getting enough
of a range of nutrients

00:32:55.670 --> 00:32:59.000
to support them in
their development.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.520
And so the community got
together, and they said, look.

00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:04.130
We've got this patch
of land at the center.

00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:06.170
We've got one well in town.

00:33:06.170 --> 00:33:11.660
Maybe we can agree
to send some of--

00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:14.000
irrigate that one
patch that doesn't

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.840
belong to any one person, and
all grow vegetables together,

00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:21.020
and agree that this is going to
be for the families who need it

00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:21.990
most.

00:33:21.990 --> 00:33:23.690
And then if there's
leftover, then it

00:33:23.690 --> 00:33:25.910
goes to the other families.

00:33:25.910 --> 00:33:27.050
And then if there's--

00:33:27.050 --> 00:33:28.880
they couldn't actually
imagine a time

00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:32.122
when they would be
leftover after that.

00:33:32.122 --> 00:33:33.830
So I met with them,
and I said, you know,

00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:35.630
can people come and
visit your garden

00:33:35.630 --> 00:33:38.187
without disrupting
your gardening?

00:33:38.187 --> 00:33:39.020
And they said, sure.

00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:39.520
Anytime.

00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:40.610
And I was like, OK.

00:33:40.610 --> 00:33:42.590
Well, actually,
it's possible you

00:33:42.590 --> 00:33:45.020
would get a lot of people
interested in this garden,

00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:48.110
so let's set some times, and
let's set a meeting place,

00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:50.540
and let's figure out who's
going to be able to let them

00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:52.820
in and show them around.

00:33:52.820 --> 00:33:55.950
So they thought it was--
clearly, they were like, well,

00:33:55.950 --> 00:33:58.670
this is just a garden that
we've started in our village.

00:33:58.670 --> 00:34:01.610
I mean like, uh, I can't imagine
tourists really want to see it,

00:34:01.610 --> 00:34:03.590
but OK.

00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:07.400
And the next time
I came, they said--

00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:09.380
first of all, the
garden had grown.

00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:12.080
Second of all, the
children had grown

00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:15.260
and were paying
attention in class.

00:34:15.260 --> 00:34:17.480
They had been able
to diversify what

00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:20.960
they were growing from
simple sort of beans and root

00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:21.590
vegetables.

00:34:21.590 --> 00:34:23.360
They were able to grow tomatoes.

00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:25.969
They were selling them
now to other villages,

00:34:25.969 --> 00:34:28.949
so they were able to buy
books for the school as well.

00:34:28.949 --> 00:34:31.860
So it had this huge
knock-on effect,

00:34:31.860 --> 00:34:33.770
and it was all
individual travelers

00:34:33.770 --> 00:34:36.560
coming through, saying, hey.

00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:40.880
We had provided a
range saying, you know,

00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:43.370
if you want to plant
one row of beans,

00:34:43.370 --> 00:34:46.170
you could leave a
donation of, like, $5,

00:34:46.170 --> 00:34:48.800
and that would do that
for this community.

00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:51.440
And people were crazy generous.

00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:54.770
And you know, were
like, well, we

00:34:54.770 --> 00:34:56.780
want you to be able
to grow as much food

00:34:56.780 --> 00:35:00.120
as your community needs.

00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:01.760
And so they were
very moved by that.

00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:04.640
The next time I came
back, they said, OK.

00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:05.840
So this is great.

00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:07.370
Our community is doing well.

00:35:07.370 --> 00:35:10.720
We're able to help out
neighboring villages

00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:13.420
to pilot similar projects.

00:35:13.420 --> 00:35:15.980
And they said, but one
thing we never realized,

00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:19.930
we never thought of ourselves
as environmental leaders.

00:35:19.930 --> 00:35:25.600
And we have had people
come to us, visitors

00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:29.780
not just from the UK, but from
Bangladesh, from Latin America,

00:35:29.780 --> 00:35:33.160
from all these other
places, saying,

00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:36.760
we could do this in the
place that I'm from.

00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:38.890
Do you mind if I
borrow this idea?

00:35:38.890 --> 00:35:42.224
And very open source,
they're like, yes.

00:35:42.224 --> 00:35:43.390
We'll tell you how to do it.

00:35:43.390 --> 00:35:45.010
We'll tell you how to scale it.

00:35:45.010 --> 00:35:48.910
We now have expertise
to offer, right?

00:35:48.910 --> 00:35:50.800
We can help you model this.

00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:55.420
So that all happened
just because there was--

00:35:55.420 --> 00:35:58.300
you know, I was thinking,
actually, of our users.

00:35:58.300 --> 00:36:02.000
I was thinking of British people
being interested in gardens.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:06.400
And in fact, it had
this tremendous impact.

00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:09.700
And that's something
that anybody could do.

00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:11.650
It doesn't have to be--

00:36:11.650 --> 00:36:15.070
you all have a
phenomenal platform,

00:36:15.070 --> 00:36:17.320
and you invent new
platforms all the time.

00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:17.870
[LAUGH]

00:36:18.370 --> 00:36:23.890
So thinking creatively
about how you can support

00:36:23.890 --> 00:36:25.360
an effort that is ongoing.

00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:30.580
Like, that's just
what you do at Google.

00:36:30.580 --> 00:36:33.080
You think about
users all the time.

00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:36.340
So if you think about
your travel the same way,

00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:37.420
what can you do?

00:36:37.420 --> 00:36:38.710
What small thing can you do?

00:36:38.710 --> 00:36:41.410
What platform can you provide?

00:36:41.410 --> 00:36:43.339
It's a powerful tool.

00:36:43.339 --> 00:36:44.630
SPEAKER 1: Thank you very much.

00:36:44.630 --> 00:36:45.460
ALISON BING: Thanks
so much, Cliff.

00:36:45.460 --> 00:36:46.360

00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:51.160
