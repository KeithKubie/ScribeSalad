00:00:04.504 --> 00:00:08.274
Narrator: CURIOSITY HAS BEEN
ROLLING AROUND MARS SINCE 2012,

00:00:08.274 --> 00:00:13.078
AND THE IMAGES IT'S BEEN
SENDING BACK HAVE BEEN STUNNING.

00:00:13.078 --> 00:00:15.615
SEQUENCES LIKE THIS BLUE SUNSET

00:00:15.615 --> 00:00:19.218
ARE STARTING TO CHANGE
OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE PLANET.

00:00:19.218 --> 00:00:22.055
BUT IT'S THE PICTURES FROM
THE MARS RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER,

00:00:22.055 --> 00:00:25.024
OF A REGION CALLED
THE NEWTON CRATER,

00:00:25.024 --> 00:00:26.959
THAT ARE HELPING
TO SHED NEW LIGHT

00:00:26.959 --> 00:00:31.030
ON THE AMOUNT OF LIQUID WATER
LEFT ON MARS.

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:33.600
THIS IS A TIME-LAPSE
SEQUENCE SHOWING STREAKS

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.536
ON THE CRATER WALL, APPARENTLY
GROWING AND GETTING DARKER.

00:00:37.536 --> 00:00:42.809
SCIENTISTS THINK THAT
THEY MIGHT BE CAUSED BY WATER.

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.479
SMALL AMOUNTS OF WATER,
COMPARED TO AN OCEAN ON EARTH

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:49.682
OR EVEN AN OCEAN ON EARLY MARS.
THEY'RE INSIGNIFICANT.

00:00:49.682 --> 00:00:52.852
BUT AS AN INDICTOR OF MARS
STILL BEING ACTIVE

00:00:52.852 --> 00:00:55.555
AND STILL HAVING LIQUID PHASES

00:00:55.555 --> 00:00:58.825
AND MAYBE A HINT OF BIGGER
AND BETTER THINGS ELSEWHERE,

00:00:58.825 --> 00:01:01.828
THEN I THINK
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT.

00:01:01.828 --> 00:01:03.463
Narrator: WHAT APPEARS
TO BE HAPPENING

00:01:03.463 --> 00:01:05.264
IS THAT THE MOISTURE
IN THE SOIL

00:01:05.264 --> 00:01:08.368
IS EVAPORATING DURING
THE RELATIVE WARMTH OF THE DAY

00:01:08.368 --> 00:01:11.537
AND CONDENSING BACK AT NIGHT
WHEN IT'S COLDER.

00:01:11.537 --> 00:01:14.841
McKay: SO MARS STILL HAS
A HEARTBEAT. IT'S A FAINT ONE,

00:01:14.841 --> 00:01:17.943
IF WE MEASURE ITS HEARTBEAT
IN TERMS OF PRESENCE OF WATER.

00:01:17.943 --> 00:01:20.780
AT ONE TIME, IT WAS HUGE.
IT WAS AN OCEAN.

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.750
AND NOW THERE'S JUST
A FAINT GLIMMER OF IT.

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.619
Narrator: THE PROBLEM IS THAT
THESE SMALL AMOUNTS OF WATER

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:29.722
ARE EXCEPTIONALLY SALTY.

00:01:29.722 --> 00:01:32.792
THE CURIOSITY ROVER HAS
IDENTIFIED IN THE MARTIAN SOIL

00:01:32.792 --> 00:01:35.728
A SALT CALLED
CALCIUM PERCHLORATE.

00:01:35.728 --> 00:01:38.564
IT'S THIS SALT
THAT ABSORBS THE MARTIAN DEW

00:01:38.564 --> 00:01:42.202
AS IT CONDENSES
ONTO THE COLD SURFACE EACH DAY.

00:01:45.038 --> 00:01:48.407
THE SALT ALSO LOWERS
THE WATER'S FREEZING POINT,

00:01:48.407 --> 00:01:53.646
KEEPING IT A LIQUID
EVEN AT SUBZERO TEMPERATURES.

00:01:53.646 --> 00:01:58.051
BUT IT ALSO MAKES THESE FAINT
TRACES OF BRINE SO CONCENTRATED,

00:01:58.051 --> 00:02:01.054
THEY WOULD BE TOXIC
TO CONVENTIONAL LIFE-FORMS.
