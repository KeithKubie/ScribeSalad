00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
When we simulate the trajectory of Apollo 13 around the moon,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
which of these are of vital importance,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
which are somewhat important,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and which are not important at all?

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
The mass of the spacecraft, the size of the moon,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
the motion of the moon around earth,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
the size of the earth, the motion of the earth around the sun,

00:00:25.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and what about 3D? Should we be doing this in a 3-dimensional fashion?
