00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:55.710
failures of negative pricing but I would
 

00:26:55.710 --> 00:26:58.970
failures of negative pricing but I would
argue that rather than the tack that

00:26:58.970 --> 00:26:58.980
argue that rather than the tack that
 

00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:01.250
argue that rather than the tack that
like Ohio has taken or Connecticut and

00:27:01.250 --> 00:27:01.260
like Ohio has taken or Connecticut and
 

00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:04.039
like Ohio has taken or Connecticut and
the conversations around Zacks I think

00:27:04.039 --> 00:27:04.049
the conversations around Zacks I think
 

00:27:04.049 --> 00:27:06.860
the conversations around Zacks I think
that's a blunt instrument that it

00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:06.870
that's a blunt instrument that it
 

00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:08.960
that's a blunt instrument that it
doesn't drive innovation and very

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:08.970
doesn't drive innovation and very
 

00:27:08.970 --> 00:27:10.879
doesn't drive innovation and very
difficult to get the price right if you

00:27:10.879 --> 00:27:10.889
difficult to get the price right if you
 

00:27:10.889 --> 00:27:12.529
difficult to get the price right if you
come up with a Zek are you gonna price

00:27:12.529 --> 00:27:12.539
come up with a Zek are you gonna price
 

00:27:12.539 --> 00:27:16.250
come up with a Zek are you gonna price
it so what I've been arguing at FERC and

00:27:16.250 --> 00:27:16.260
it so what I've been arguing at FERC and
 

00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:17.899
it so what I've been arguing at FERC and
on what I argue within the Commonwealth

00:27:17.899 --> 00:27:17.909
on what I argue within the Commonwealth
 

00:27:17.909 --> 00:27:20.149
on what I argue within the Commonwealth
here is for a price on carbon say all

00:27:20.149 --> 00:27:20.159
here is for a price on carbon say all
 

00:27:20.159 --> 00:27:23.389
here is for a price on carbon say all
right maybe we all don't want to think

00:27:23.389 --> 00:27:23.399
right maybe we all don't want to think
 

00:27:23.399 --> 00:27:25.370
right maybe we all don't want to think
about price and carbon because it's

00:27:25.370 --> 00:27:25.380
about price and carbon because it's
 

00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:27.980
about price and carbon because it's
because we think that climate change is

00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:27.990
because we think that climate change is
 

00:27:27.990 --> 00:27:30.110
because we think that climate change is
a fundamentally important issue but if

00:27:30.110 --> 00:27:30.120
a fundamentally important issue but if
 

00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:31.399
a fundamentally important issue but if
you are gonna have a market mechanism

00:27:31.399 --> 00:27:31.409
you are gonna have a market mechanism
 

00:27:31.409 --> 00:27:38.419
you are gonna have a market mechanism
that can protect and remunerated sources

00:27:38.419 --> 00:27:38.429
that can protect and remunerated sources
 

00:27:38.429 --> 00:27:40.669
that can protect and remunerated sources
like nuclear put a price on carbon to

00:27:40.669 --> 00:27:40.679
like nuclear put a price on carbon to
 

00:27:40.679 --> 00:27:43.460
like nuclear put a price on carbon to
put it in the energy market that is a

00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:43.470
put it in the energy market that is a
 

00:27:43.470 --> 00:27:49.789
put it in the energy market that is a
pretty nimble transparent clever way to

pretty nimble transparent clever way to
 

00:27:49.799 --> 00:27:51.980
pretty nimble transparent clever way to
do it drives innovation all operators

00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:51.990
do it drives innovation all operators
 

00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:53.539
do it drives innovation all operators
can then say alright well we've got this

00:27:53.539 --> 00:27:53.549
can then say alright well we've got this
 

00:27:53.549 --> 00:27:54.980
can then say alright well we've got this
price of carbon how do we innovate our

00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:54.990

have a price signal that is doing what

00:28:05.870 --> 00:28:05.880
have a price signal that is doing what
 

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:07.759

it should do rather than this

00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:53.110
going to again rate bass coal but we
 

00:28:53.110 --> 00:28:55.440
going to again rate bass coal but we
want our ISO so think about this

00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:55.450
want our ISO so think about this
 

00:28:55.450 --> 00:28:58.230

question of resiliency that was raised

00:28:58.230 --> 00:28:58.240
question of resiliency that was raised
 

00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:02.130
question of resiliency that was raised
in that Abidin by secretary Perry but

00:29:02.130 --> 00:29:02.140
in that Abidin by secretary Perry but

it's not new to PGM we've long been in

00:29:04.530 --> 00:29:04.540
it's not new to PGM we've long been in
 

00:29:04.540 --> 00:29:06.570
it's not new to PGM we've long been in
conversations about resiliency and the

00:29:06.570 --> 00:29:06.580
conversations about resiliency and the
 

00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:07.980
conversations about resiliency and the
value of some of these attributes that

value of some of these attributes that
 

00:29:07.990 --> 00:29:09.900
value of some of these attributes that
weren't historically valued again it

goes back to the complexity and

00:29:11.250 --> 00:29:11.260
goes back to the complexity and
 

00:29:11.260 --> 00:29:13.289
goes back to the complexity and
modernization of what we're these

00:29:13.289 --> 00:29:13.299
modernization of what we're these
 

00:29:13.299 --> 00:29:14.640

markets they're not so sort of

00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:14.650
markets they're not so sort of

monolithic one attribute markets and
yeah used to be just move some electrons

00:29:20.190 --> 00:29:20.200
yeah used to be just move some electrons
 

00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:22.380
yeah used to be just move some electrons
and hey we have a market but there are a

00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:22.390
and hey we have a market but there are a
 

00:29:22.390 --> 00:29:24.210
and hey we have a market but there are a
lot of other attributes out there that

00:29:24.210 --> 00:29:24.220
lot of other attributes out there that
 

00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:29.789
lot of other attributes out there that
we rationally should be pricing but some

00:29:29.789 --> 00:29:29.799
we rationally should be pricing but some
 

00:29:29.799 --> 00:29:30.870
we rationally should be pricing but some
are easier than others and some are

00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:30.880
are easier than others and some are
 

00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:32.730
are easier than others and some are
quite difficult and resiliency is want

00:29:32.730 --> 00:29:32.740
quite difficult and resiliency is want
 

00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:35.669
quite difficult and resiliency is want
to properly price but I'd argue that we

00:29:35.669 --> 00:29:35.679
to properly price but I'd argue that we
 

00:29:35.679 --> 00:29:37.860
to properly price but I'd argue that we
need to I think we can get there I think

00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:37.870
need to I think we can get there I think
 

00:29:37.870 --> 00:29:39.510
need to I think we can get there I think
it's complicated and challenging and

00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:39.520
it's complicated and challenging and
 

00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:42.390
it's complicated and challenging and
capacity constructs are already very

00:29:42.390 --> 00:29:42.400
capacity constructs are already very
 

00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:46.530
capacity constructs are already very
difficult artificial constructs not true

markets and some of this lends more to

00:29:49.350 --> 00:29:49.360
markets and some of this lends more to
 

00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:50.820
markets and some of this lends more to
that challenge that you already have in

00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:50.830
that challenge that you already have in
 

00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:53.730
that challenge that you already have in
the capacity markets but there is real

00:29:53.730 --> 00:29:53.740
the capacity markets but there is real
 

00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:57.570
the capacity markets but there is real
rational reason to valued resiliency

00:29:57.570 --> 00:29:57.580
rational reason to valued resiliency
 

00:29:57.580 --> 00:30:00.360
rational reason to valued resiliency
it's not 90 days of fuel on site fuel

he looked back to the 2014 pulled a
vortex and said look there was all this

market failure because of lack of
 

00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:15.270
market failure because of lack of
resiliency and he argued that the 90

resiliency and he argued that the 90
 

00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:17.460

days of fuel on site fuel would resolve

00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:17.470
days of fuel on site fuel would resolve
 

00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:18.930
days of fuel on site fuel would resolve
that resiliency problem but if you look

00:30:18.930 --> 00:30:18.940
that resiliency problem but if you look
 

00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:22.620
that resiliency problem but if you look
at the numbers it doesn't it doesn't

00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:22.630
at the numbers it doesn't it doesn't

issues but the but additionally if you
 

00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:40.190
issues but the but additionally if you
look at where the real resiliency

00:30:40.190 --> 00:30:40.200
look at where the real resiliency
 

00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:42.950
look at where the real resiliency
challenge is it's in the the

00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:42.960
challenge is it's in the the
 

00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:45.050
challenge is it's in the the
distribution and transmission but

want to tackle resiliency that's where
 

00:30:49.350 --> 00:30:51.230
want to tackle resiliency that's where
you have to tackle it and more broadly

00:30:51.230 --> 00:30:51.240
you have to tackle it and more broadly
 

00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:53.540
you have to tackle it and more broadly
across the whole panoply not simply by

about the way that we kind of think

00:47:24.829 --> 00:47:24.839
about the way that we kind of think

about climate change in culture I've

00:47:27.349 --> 00:47:27.359
about climate change in culture I've
 

00:47:27.359 --> 00:47:29.990

how we talk about these things so the

how we talk about these things so the
first is - there's a tendency to kind of

00:47:34.790 --> 00:47:34.800
first is - there's a tendency to kind of
 

00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:37.400
first is - there's a tendency to kind of

environmental problems that relate are
 

00:53:06.290 --> 00:53:09.010
environmental problems that relate are
related to fossil fuel use but also just

00:53:09.010 --> 00:53:09.020
related to fossil fuel use but also just
 

00:53:09.020 --> 00:53:10.270

kind of ways in which we can think about

00:53:10.270 --> 00:53:10.280
kind of ways in which we can think about
 

00:53:10.280 --> 00:53:13.630
kind of ways in which we can think about
how culture can help us to think through

00:53:13.630 --> 00:53:13.640
how culture can help us to think through
 

00:53:13.640 --> 00:53:16.810
how culture can help us to think through
some of the the longer-term ways in

00:53:16.810 --> 00:53:16.820
some of the the longer-term ways in
 

00:53:16.820 --> 00:53:18.400
some of the the longer-term ways in
which we've used resources and have

00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:18.410
which we've used resources and have
 

00:53:18.410 --> 00:53:21.790

and energy humanities I'm a historian

00:53:40.349 --> 00:53:40.359
and energy humanities I'm a historian
 

00:53:40.359 --> 00:53:41.520
and energy humanities I'm a historian
and I'm gonna look at some of the

and I'm gonna look at some of the
 

00:53:41.530 --> 00:53:45.599
and I'm gonna look at some of the
materials that I can use as a historian

00:53:45.599 --> 00:53:45.609
materials that I can use as a historian
 

00:53:45.609 --> 00:53:48.480
materials that I can use as a historian
to do the work of energy humanities to

00:53:48.480 --> 00:53:48.490
to do the work of energy humanities to
 

00:53:48.490 --> 00:53:50.099
to do the work of energy humanities to
think about humanities and also think

00:53:50.099 --> 00:53:50.109
think about humanities and also think
 

00:53:50.109 --> 00:53:52.099
think about humanities and also think
about energy and the science and

00:53:52.099 --> 00:53:52.109
about energy and the science and
 

00:53:52.109 --> 00:53:54.570
about energy and the science and
engineering of it at the same time and

this is one example of knowing the just

00:53:58.109 --> 00:53:58.119
this is one example of knowing the just
 

00:53:58.119 --> 00:53:59.820
this is one example of knowing the just
enough about the language of science I

00:53:59.820 --> 00:53:59.830
enough about the language of science I
 

00:53:59.830 --> 00:54:01.290
enough about the language of science I
think it's really important to know

00:54:01.290 --> 00:54:01.300
think it's really important to know
 

00:54:01.300 --> 00:54:02.940
think it's really important to know
what's going on inside the world of

00:54:02.940 --> 00:54:02.950
what's going on inside the world of
 

00:54:02.950 --> 00:54:04.890
what's going on inside the world of
science and engineering not to be a

00:54:04.890 --> 00:54:04.900
science and engineering not to be a
 

00:54:04.900 --> 00:54:06.810
science and engineering not to be a
scientist or an engineer but also to be

00:54:06.810 --> 00:54:06.820
scientist or an engineer but also to be
 

00:54:06.820 --> 00:54:08.940
scientist or an engineer but also to be
able to use that language and to

00:54:08.940 --> 00:54:08.950
able to use that language and to
 

00:54:08.950 --> 00:54:10.710
able to use that language and to
understand just enough to ask our own

00:54:10.710 --> 00:54:10.720
understand just enough to ask our own
 

00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:12.840
understand just enough to ask our own
questions our own humanities questions

00:54:12.840 --> 00:54:12.850

is ethnography so understanding people

00:55:41.760 --> 00:55:41.770
is ethnography so understanding people
 

00:55:41.770 --> 00:55:44.550

I'd like to add is just I think that

I'd like to add is just I think that

I'd like to add is just I think that
something that the art that I look at it

something that the art that I look at it
 

01:13:24.660 --> 01:13:26.870

brings to the table is is a way that
kind of encouraging us to think in a

01:13:31.010 --> 01:13:31.020

so thinking both you know we think often
 

01:13:34.909 --> 01:13:36.339
so thinking both you know we think often
about like what the life of a certain

01:13:36.339 --> 01:13:36.349

it's something that you know we see this

in not to mention coal itself so we have

01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:00.650
in not to mention coal itself so we have
 

01:14:00.650 --> 01:14:02.649

just these ways in which these kind of

01:14:02.649 --> 01:14:02.659
just these ways in which these kind of

objects these cultural objects can just
 

01:14:05.510 --> 01:14:08.290
objects these cultural objects can just
help us think more thoroughly about

01:14:08.290 --> 01:14:08.300
help us think more thoroughly about
 

01:14:08.300 --> 01:14:12.609
help us think more thoroughly about
about time yeah I would add to that an

about time yeah I would add to that an
 

01:14:12.619 --> 01:14:14.740
about time yeah I would add to that an

is how short the fossil fuel age has
been and while we're incredibly

01:14:26.919 --> 01:14:26.929
been and while we're incredibly
 

01:14:26.929 --> 01:14:30.850
been and while we're incredibly
dependent on these technologies now most

01:14:30.850 --> 01:14:30.860
dependent on these technologies now most
 

01:14:30.860 --> 01:14:34.689
dependent on these technologies now most
of human history has been without the

01:14:34.689 --> 01:14:34.699
of human history has been without the
 

01:14:34.699 --> 01:14:36.750
of human history has been without the
kind of resources we take for granted

01:14:36.750 --> 01:14:36.760
kind of resources we take for granted
 

01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:43.060
kind of resources we take for granted
and that we are running out of so a lot

01:14:43.060 --> 01:14:43.070
and that we are running out of so a lot
 

01:14:43.070 --> 01:14:45.280
and that we are running out of so a lot
of our dystopian narratives imagine a

01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:45.290
of our dystopian narratives imagine a
 

01:14:45.290 --> 01:14:48.070
of our dystopian narratives imagine a
world beyond fossil fuels like Walking

01:14:48.070 --> 01:14:48.080
world beyond fossil fuels like Walking
 

01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:50.589
world beyond fossil fuels like Walking
Dead there's not a lot of electricity

01:14:50.589 --> 01:14:50.599
Dead there's not a lot of electricity
 

01:14:50.599 --> 01:14:53.530
Dead there's not a lot of electricity
and Walking Dead for example so I just

01:14:53.530 --> 01:14:53.540
and Walking Dead for example so I just
 

01:14:53.540 --> 01:14:56.020
and Walking Dead for example so I just
want us to be humble in our thinking

01:14:56.020 --> 01:14:56.030
want us to be humble in our thinking
 

01:14:56.030 --> 01:14:58.600
want us to be humble in our thinking
about what is our right to these

01:14:58.600 --> 01:14:58.610
about what is our right to these
 

01:14:58.610 --> 01:15:01.990
about what is our right to these
resources and for and that we've had

01:15:01.990 --> 01:15:02.000
resources and for and that we've had
 

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:03.850
resources and for and that we've had
them for a very short time and that we

01:15:03.850 --> 01:15:03.860
them for a very short time and that we
 

01:15:03.860 --> 01:15:09.520
them for a very short time and that we
may not have them for much longer it's

01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:09.530
may not have them for much longer it's
 

01:15:09.530 --> 01:15:14.490
may not have them for much longer it's
related to to these how do we build

01:15:14.490 --> 01:15:14.500
related to to these how do we build
 

01:15:14.500 --> 01:15:18.990
related to to these how do we build
curriculum to reflect this philosophy

01:15:18.990 --> 01:15:19.000
curriculum to reflect this philosophy
 

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:29.550
curriculum to reflect this philosophy
curriculum

01:15:29.550 --> 01:15:29.560
 

01:15:29.560 --> 01:15:31.860
I think that providing accessible

01:15:31.860 --> 01:15:31.870
I think that providing accessible
 

01:15:31.870 --> 01:15:34.560
I think that providing accessible
historical examples is one way to relate

01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:34.570
historical examples is one way to relate
 

01:15:34.570 --> 01:15:36.630
historical examples is one way to relate
to humans in the past and see how we

01:15:36.630 --> 01:15:36.640
to humans in the past and see how we
 

01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:39.060
to humans in the past and see how we
might be doing things differently or the

01:15:39.060 --> 01:15:39.070
might be doing things differently or the
 

01:15:39.070 --> 01:15:41.190
might be doing things differently or the
same right now it's it's a great

01:15:41.190 --> 01:15:41.200
same right now it's it's a great
 

01:15:41.200 --> 01:15:44.490
same right now it's it's a great
awareness builder I think history I'm a

01:15:44.490 --> 01:15:44.500
awareness builder I think history I'm a
 

01:15:44.500 --> 01:15:46.950
awareness builder I think history I'm a
historian of course is is without

01:15:46.950 --> 01:15:46.960
historian of course is is without
 

01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:49.800
historian of course is is without
parallel in that case so I think that

01:15:49.800 --> 01:15:49.810
parallel in that case so I think that
 

01:15:49.810 --> 01:15:52.080
parallel in that case so I think that
knowing how we got to where we are and

01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:52.090
knowing how we got to where we are and
 

01:15:52.090 --> 01:15:55.740
knowing how we got to where we are and
also being really conscious about where

01:15:55.740 --> 01:15:55.750
also being really conscious about where
 

01:15:55.750 --> 01:15:57.660
also being really conscious about where
we're at and what our discussions for

01:15:57.660 --> 01:15:57.670
we're at and what our discussions for
 

01:15:57.670 --> 01:15:59.750
we're at and what our discussions for
the future are and seeing that in fact

01:15:59.750 --> 01:15:59.760
the future are and seeing that in fact
 

01:15:59.760 --> 01:16:03.780
the future are and seeing that in fact
we are embedded in some social

01:16:03.780 --> 01:16:03.790
we are embedded in some social
 

01:16:03.790 --> 01:16:05.760
we are embedded in some social
assumptions and some mindsets is really

01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:05.770
assumptions and some mindsets is really
 

01:16:05.770 --> 01:16:08.190
assumptions and some mindsets is really
important I also think that having

01:16:08.190 --> 01:16:08.200
important I also think that having
 

01:16:08.200 --> 01:16:11.910
important I also think that having
language to cross disciplines is part of

01:16:11.910 --> 01:16:11.920
language to cross disciplines is part of
 

01:16:11.920 --> 01:16:13.950
language to cross disciplines is part of
this so for Humanities I think having

01:16:13.950 --> 01:16:13.960
this so for Humanities I think having
 

01:16:13.960 --> 01:16:15.900
this so for Humanities I think having
the language of science as part of our

01:16:15.900 --> 01:16:15.910
the language of science as part of our
 

01:16:15.910 --> 01:16:19.530
the language of science as part of our
discussion not to be a scientist is

01:16:19.530 --> 01:16:19.540
discussion not to be a scientist is
 

01:16:19.540 --> 01:16:21.420
discussion not to be a scientist is
important and I think the same for

01:16:21.420 --> 01:16:21.430
important and I think the same for
 

01:16:21.430 --> 01:16:23.730
important and I think the same for
science and engineering having the

01:16:23.730 --> 01:16:23.740
science and engineering having the
 

01:16:23.740 --> 01:16:25.470
science and engineering having the
language of humanities understanding

01:16:25.470 --> 01:16:25.480
language of humanities understanding
 

01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:27.090
language of humanities understanding
what a close reading is what a critical

01:16:27.090 --> 01:16:27.100
what a close reading is what a critical
 

01:16:27.100 --> 01:16:29.300
what a close reading is what a critical
reading is what an image analysis is

01:16:29.300 --> 01:16:29.310
reading is what an image analysis is
 

01:16:29.310 --> 01:16:31.860
reading is what an image analysis is
what is social analysis is I think that

01:16:31.860 --> 01:16:31.870
what is social analysis is I think that
 

01:16:31.870 --> 01:16:34.260
what is social analysis is I think that
all of this is really important so

01:16:34.260 --> 01:16:34.270
all of this is really important so
 

01:16:34.270 --> 01:16:38.460
all of this is really important so
getting some of each and each and on

01:16:38.460 --> 01:16:38.470
getting some of each and each and on
 

01:16:38.470 --> 01:16:41.190
getting some of each and each and on
that note I also think that issues like

01:16:41.190 --> 01:16:41.200
that note I also think that issues like
 

01:16:41.200 --> 01:16:42.630
that note I also think that issues like
energy in the environment are something

01:16:42.630 --> 01:16:42.640
energy in the environment are something
 

01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:45.630
energy in the environment are something
that you know cuts across disciplines so

01:16:45.630 --> 01:16:45.640
that you know cuts across disciplines so
 

01:16:45.640 --> 01:16:47.940
that you know cuts across disciplines so
well that it's enables students to kind

01:16:47.940 --> 01:16:47.950
well that it's enables students to kind
 

01:16:47.950 --> 01:16:50.070
well that it's enables students to kind
of not just kind of not just think about

01:16:50.070 --> 01:16:50.080
of not just kind of not just think about
 

01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:52.560
of not just kind of not just think about
their you know their immediate work but

01:16:52.560 --> 01:16:52.570
their you know their immediate work but
 

01:16:52.570 --> 01:16:55.140
their you know their immediate work but
to how their work connects to you know

01:16:55.140 --> 01:16:55.150
to how their work connects to you know
 

01:16:55.150 --> 01:16:56.940
to how their work connects to you know
range of disciplines and how they can

01:16:56.940 --> 01:16:56.950
range of disciplines and how they can
 

01:16:56.950 --> 01:16:57.750
range of disciplines and how they can
draw from that

01:16:57.750 --> 01:16:57.760
draw from that
 

01:16:57.760 --> 01:16:59.970
draw from that
so in teaching first-year writing

01:16:59.970 --> 01:16:59.980
so in teaching first-year writing
 

01:16:59.980 --> 01:17:02.130
so in teaching first-year writing
classes based on some of these topics

01:17:02.130 --> 01:17:02.140
classes based on some of these topics
 

01:17:02.140 --> 01:17:05.910
classes based on some of these topics
it's interesting to see folks who you

01:17:05.910 --> 01:17:05.920
it's interesting to see folks who you
 

01:17:05.920 --> 01:17:08.400
it's interesting to see folks who you
know might not you know enter it into

01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:08.410
know might not you know enter it into
 

01:17:08.410 --> 01:17:09.750
know might not you know enter it into
this semester wanting to think about

01:17:09.750 --> 01:17:09.760
this semester wanting to think about
 

01:17:09.760 --> 01:17:11.070
this semester wanting to think about
social problems at all

01:17:11.070 --> 01:17:11.080
social problems at all
 

01:17:11.080 --> 01:17:13.110
social problems at all
walk away understanding the way in which

01:17:13.110 --> 01:17:13.120
walk away understanding the way in which
 

01:17:13.120 --> 01:17:15.480
walk away understanding the way in which
engineering is you know very much

01:17:15.480 --> 01:17:15.490
engineering is you know very much
 

01:17:15.490 --> 01:17:18.900
engineering is you know very much
connected to these these decisions we

01:17:18.900 --> 01:17:18.910
connected to these these decisions we
 

01:17:18.910 --> 01:17:21.000
connected to these these decisions we
make as a society as far as how we use

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:21.010
make as a society as far as how we use
 

01:17:21.010 --> 01:17:23.720
make as a society as far as how we use
resources so it's it's a way that we can

01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:23.730
resources so it's it's a way that we can
 

01:17:23.730 --> 01:17:26.340
resources so it's it's a way that we can
just kind of as Abigail said have that

01:17:26.340 --> 01:17:26.350
just kind of as Abigail said have that
 

01:17:26.350 --> 01:17:28.890
just kind of as Abigail said have that
common language that we can connect all

01:17:28.890 --> 01:17:28.900
common language that we can connect all
 

01:17:28.900 --> 01:17:30.320
common language that we can connect all
of these different approaches to

01:17:30.320 --> 01:17:30.330
of these different approaches to
 

01:17:30.330 --> 01:17:36.240
of these different approaches to
problems together

01:17:36.240 --> 01:17:36.250
 

01:17:36.250 --> 01:17:41.740
yeah yeah and then you know the next

01:17:41.740 --> 01:17:41.750
yeah yeah and then you know the next
 

01:17:41.750 --> 01:17:44.680
yeah yeah and then you know the next
class I'm teaching is on waste and so

01:17:44.680 --> 01:17:44.690
class I'm teaching is on waste and so
 

01:17:44.690 --> 01:17:46.810
class I'm teaching is on waste and so
you know that's again something that's

01:17:46.810 --> 01:17:46.820
you know that's again something that's
 

01:17:46.820 --> 01:17:49.870
you know that's again something that's
very much a cultural object that we see

01:17:49.870 --> 01:17:49.880
very much a cultural object that we see
 

01:17:49.880 --> 01:17:52.959
very much a cultural object that we see
in our everyday lives that that touches

01:17:52.959 --> 01:17:52.969
in our everyday lives that that touches
 

01:17:52.969 --> 01:17:56.729
in our everyday lives that that touches
and touches on designed on on

01:17:56.729 --> 01:17:56.739
and touches on designed on on
 

01:17:56.739 --> 01:17:59.620
and touches on designed on on
engineering on you know all of these

01:17:59.620 --> 01:17:59.630
engineering on you know all of these
 

01:17:59.630 --> 01:18:02.380
engineering on you know all of these
kind of problems so it's again this

01:18:02.380 --> 01:18:02.390
kind of problems so it's again this
 

01:18:02.390 --> 01:18:04.060
kind of problems so it's again this
common symbol that's come in something

01:18:04.060 --> 01:18:04.070
common symbol that's come in something
 

01:18:04.070 --> 01:18:07.209
common symbol that's come in something
that allows us all to come together to

01:18:07.209 --> 01:18:07.219
that allows us all to come together to
 

01:18:07.219 --> 01:18:10.770
that allows us all to come together to
think about broader and my apologies

01:18:10.770 --> 01:18:10.780
 

01:18:10.780 --> 01:18:13.030
I'll just talk very briefly about a

01:18:13.030 --> 01:18:13.040
I'll just talk very briefly about a
 

01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:14.410
I'll just talk very briefly about a
class that I teach called environmental

01:18:14.410 --> 01:18:14.420
class that I teach called environmental
 

01:18:14.420 --> 01:18:16.030
class that I teach called environmental
literature it's a 19th century

01:18:16.030 --> 01:18:16.040
literature it's a 19th century
 

01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:19.090
literature it's a 19th century
literature class and I make the students

01:18:19.090 --> 01:18:19.100
literature class and I make the students
 

01:18:19.100 --> 01:18:21.940
literature class and I make the students
go on five nature walks during the

01:18:21.940 --> 01:18:21.950
go on five nature walks during the
 

01:18:21.950 --> 01:18:23.800
go on five nature walks during the
course and the walk has to be at least

01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:23.810
course and the walk has to be at least
 

01:18:23.810 --> 01:18:26.620
course and the walk has to be at least
an hour and they can't bring technology

01:18:26.620 --> 01:18:26.630
an hour and they can't bring technology
 

01:18:26.630 --> 01:18:28.540
an hour and they can't bring technology
on their walk and students have told me

01:18:28.540 --> 01:18:28.550
on their walk and students have told me
 

01:18:28.550 --> 01:18:30.280
on their walk and students have told me
it's the hardest assignment they've ever

01:18:30.280 --> 01:18:30.290
it's the hardest assignment they've ever
 

01:18:30.290 --> 01:18:33.640
it's the hardest assignment they've ever
been given at Carnegie Mellon so I think

01:18:33.640 --> 01:18:33.650
been given at Carnegie Mellon so I think
 

01:18:33.650 --> 01:18:35.560
been given at Carnegie Mellon so I think
what we're all trying to do is really

01:18:35.560 --> 01:18:35.570
what we're all trying to do is really
 

01:18:35.570 --> 01:18:37.360
what we're all trying to do is really
kind of peel things back and take

01:18:37.360 --> 01:18:37.370
kind of peel things back and take
 

01:18:37.370 --> 01:18:41.590
kind of peel things back and take
students just kind of remove again some

01:18:41.590 --> 01:18:41.600
students just kind of remove again some
 

01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:43.300
students just kind of remove again some
of the things we've become dependent on

01:18:43.300 --> 01:18:43.310

right light it's an interesting dilemma
so light is a major consumption of power

01:58:14.870 --> 01:58:14.880
so light is a major consumption of power

18% of the world's energy is consumed
 

01:58:19.200 --> 01:58:21.230
18% of the world's energy is consumed
through light sources so there's a huge

01:58:21.230 --> 01:58:21.240
through light sources so there's a huge
 

01:58:21.240 --> 01:58:23.630
through light sources so there's a huge
amount of pressure to reduce the amount

01:58:23.630 --> 01:58:23.640
amount of pressure to reduce the amount
 

01:58:23.640 --> 01:58:26.720
amount of pressure to reduce the amount
of energy that light consumes yet there

01:58:26.720 --> 01:58:26.730
of energy that light consumes yet there
 

01:58:26.730 --> 01:58:30.920
of energy that light consumes yet there
is exponential demand for light right so

01:58:30.920 --> 01:58:30.930
is exponential demand for light right so
 

01:58:30.930 --> 01:58:32.810
is exponential demand for light right so
so the predictions is more as the

01:58:32.810 --> 01:58:32.820
so the predictions is more as the
 

01:58:32.820 --> 01:58:34.810
so the predictions is more as the
population this planet grows there's

01:58:34.810 --> 01:58:34.820
population this planet grows there's
 

01:58:34.820 --> 01:58:36.980
population this planet grows there's
actually one sobering data point there's

01:58:36.980 --> 01:58:36.990
actually one sobering data point there's
 

01:58:36.990 --> 01:58:38.720
actually one sobering data point there's
1.2 billion people that don't have

01:58:38.720 --> 01:58:38.730
1.2 billion people that don't have
 

01:58:38.730 --> 01:58:40.550
1.2 billion people that don't have
access to regular energy or light

01:58:40.550 --> 01:58:40.560
access to regular energy or light
 

01:58:40.560 --> 01:58:42.620
access to regular energy or light
sources so there's a huge demand just

01:58:42.620 --> 01:58:42.630
sources so there's a huge demand just
 

01:58:42.630 --> 01:58:44.630
sources so there's a huge demand just
there but as the whole world urbanized

01:58:44.630 --> 01:58:44.640
there but as the whole world urbanized
 

01:58:44.640 --> 01:58:46.100
there but as the whole world urbanized
is we're looking at more and more light

01:58:46.100 --> 01:58:46.110
is we're looking at more and more light
 

01:58:46.110 --> 01:58:48.560
is we're looking at more and more light
sources hitting the world so therefore

01:58:48.560 --> 01:58:48.570
sources hitting the world so therefore
 

01:58:48.570 --> 01:58:50.630

02:12:41.540 --> 02:12:41.550
air-conditioning as a retailer you can
 

02:12:41.550 --> 02:12:42.890
air-conditioning as a retailer you can
figure out where you are in the store

02:12:42.890 --> 02:12:42.900
figure out where you are in the store
 

02:12:42.900 --> 02:12:45.200

we've got to do where I'll finish on is

02:12:50.720 --> 02:12:50.730
we've got to do where I'll finish on is
 

02:12:50.730 --> 02:12:53.960
we've got to do where I'll finish on is
we have to feed this world so light put

02:12:53.960 --> 02:12:53.970
we have to feed this world so light put
 

02:12:53.970 --> 02:12:55.490
we have to feed this world so light put
light sources and the way we use

02:12:55.490 --> 02:12:55.500
light sources and the way we use
 

02:12:55.500 --> 02:12:58.070
light sources and the way we use
horticultural lighting to make things

02:12:58.070 --> 02:12:58.080
horticultural lighting to make things
 

02:12:58.080 --> 02:12:59.690
horticultural lighting to make things
grow as efficiently and as effectively

02:12:59.690 --> 02:12:59.700
grow as efficiently and as effectively
 

02:12:59.700 --> 02:13:02.440
grow as efficiently and as effectively
as impossible hopefully as allows us to

02:13:02.440 --> 02:13:02.450
as impossible hopefully as allows us to
 

02:13:02.450 --> 02:13:05.810
as impossible hopefully as allows us to
feed the world as well so in that

02:13:05.810 --> 02:13:05.820
feed the world as well so in that
 

02:13:05.820 --> 02:13:07.670
feed the world as well so in that
lightning recession there I know we want

02:13:07.670 --> 02:13:07.680
lightning recession there I know we want
 

02:13:07.680 --> 02:13:09.170
lightning recession there I know we want
to turn this into an interactive session

you some questions about how Phillips is
 

02:13:37.040 --> 02:13:38.379
you some questions about how Phillips is
thinking about these things not just

02:13:38.379 --> 02:13:38.389
thinking about these things not just
 

02:13:38.389 --> 02:13:41.439
thinking about these things not just
from a product aspect but also from how

02:13:41.439 --> 02:13:41.449
from a product aspect but also from how
 

02:13:41.449 --> 02:13:42.100
from a product aspect but also from how
you do business

yep connect it back to how the
 

02:13:44.690 --> 02:13:46.629
yep connect it back to how the
university connects and then talk about

02:13:46.629 --> 02:13:46.639
university connects and then talk about
 

02:13:46.639 --> 02:13:49.990
university connects and then talk about
kind of how this scales in the future so

02:13:49.990 --> 02:13:50.000
kind of how this scales in the future so
 

02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:53.530
kind of how this scales in the future so
first we've heard some interesting ideas

02:13:53.530 --> 02:13:53.540
first we've heard some interesting ideas
 

02:13:53.540 --> 02:13:56.610
first we've heard some interesting ideas
about change models um in the past

02:13:56.610 --> 02:13:56.620
about change models um in the past
 

02:13:56.620 --> 02:13:58.660
about change models um in the past
presentations yesterday and the day

02:13:58.660 --> 02:13:58.670
presentations yesterday and the day
 

02:13:58.670 --> 02:14:02.439
presentations yesterday and the day
before I'd say if I had to paraphrase

02:14:02.439 --> 02:14:02.449
before I'd say if I had to paraphrase
 

02:14:02.449 --> 02:14:04.090
before I'd say if I had to paraphrase
how people talked about it some people

02:14:04.090 --> 02:14:04.100
how people talked about it some people
 

02:14:04.100 --> 02:14:05.979
how people talked about it some people
talked about their company's is kind of

02:14:05.979 --> 02:14:05.989
talked about their company's is kind of
 

02:14:05.989 --> 02:14:09.040
talked about their company's is kind of
virtuous innovators other ones are

02:14:09.040 --> 02:14:09.050
virtuous innovators other ones are
 

02:14:09.050 --> 02:14:12.700
virtuous innovators other ones are
profit driven implementers crisis

02:14:12.700 --> 02:14:12.710
profit driven implementers crisis
 

02:14:12.710 --> 02:14:14.979
profit driven implementers crisis
disruption is another model of change

02:14:14.979 --> 02:14:14.989
disruption is another model of change
 

02:14:14.989 --> 02:14:18.700
disruption is another model of change
code driven change you know there's a

02:14:18.700 --> 02:14:18.710
code driven change you know there's a
 

02:14:18.710 --> 02:14:20.169
code driven change you know there's a
number of different ways that companies

02:14:20.169 --> 02:14:20.179
number of different ways that companies
 

02:14:20.179 --> 02:14:23.200
number of different ways that companies
are thinking about or researchers are

02:14:23.200 --> 02:14:23.210
are thinking about or researchers are
 

02:14:23.210 --> 02:14:26.320
are thinking about or researchers are
thinking about how their their offerings

02:14:26.320 --> 02:14:26.330
thinking about how their their offerings
 

02:14:26.330 --> 02:14:28.899
thinking about how their their offerings
are gonna be taken up in the market how

02:14:28.899 --> 02:14:28.909
are gonna be taken up in the market how
 

02:14:28.909 --> 02:14:31.660
are gonna be taken up in the market how
where does fits Philip's fit in this

02:14:31.660 --> 02:14:31.670
where does fits Philip's fit in this
 

02:14:31.670 --> 02:14:33.879
where does fits Philip's fit in this
continuum and how do you all think about

02:14:33.879 --> 02:14:33.889
continuum and how do you all think about
 

02:14:33.889 --> 02:14:35.770
continuum and how do you all think about
yeah it's it's a great great question

02:14:35.770 --> 02:14:35.780
yeah it's it's a great great question
 

02:14:35.780 --> 02:14:38.350
yeah it's it's a great great question
and actually I think it's it's it's the

02:14:38.350 --> 02:14:38.360
and actually I think it's it's it's the
 

02:14:38.360 --> 02:14:42.370
and actually I think it's it's it's the
right question too because you know

02:14:42.370 --> 02:14:42.380
right question too because you know
 

02:14:42.380 --> 02:14:44.320
right question too because you know
being a publicly traded company now

02:14:44.320 --> 02:14:44.330
being a publicly traded company now
 

02:14:44.330 --> 02:14:46.629
being a publicly traded company now
there are certain pressures on you to

02:14:46.629 --> 02:14:46.639
there are certain pressures on you to
 

02:14:46.639 --> 02:14:48.490
there are certain pressures on you to
deliver results and continue to be

02:14:48.490 --> 02:14:48.500
deliver results and continue to be
 

02:14:48.500 --> 02:14:52.209
deliver results and continue to be
successful but hopefully that doesn't

02:14:52.209 --> 02:14:52.219
successful but hopefully that doesn't
 

02:14:52.219 --> 02:14:54.669
successful but hopefully that doesn't
distract you from your core values and

02:14:54.669 --> 02:14:54.679
distract you from your core values and
 

02:14:54.679 --> 02:14:56.979
distract you from your core values and
your on your core focus and one of

02:14:56.979 --> 02:14:56.989
your on your core focus and one of
 

02:14:56.989 --> 02:14:58.810
your on your core focus and one of
Phillips Lighting's core values and

02:14:58.810 --> 02:14:58.820
Phillips Lighting's core values and
 

02:14:58.820 --> 02:15:01.899
Phillips Lighting's core values and
focus is innovation in lighting and the

02:15:01.899 --> 02:15:01.909
focus is innovation in lighting and the
 

02:15:01.909 --> 02:15:04.300
focus is innovation in lighting and the
benefit of lighting and so I'm actually

02:15:04.300 --> 02:15:04.310
benefit of lighting and so I'm actually
 

02:15:04.310 --> 02:15:06.189
benefit of lighting and so I'm actually
pretty proud and I've only been here at

02:15:06.189 --> 02:15:06.199
pretty proud and I've only been here at
 

02:15:06.199 --> 02:15:08.260
pretty proud and I've only been here at
90 days type thing but the the balance

02:15:08.260 --> 02:15:08.270
90 days type thing but the the balance
 

02:15:08.270 --> 02:15:10.229
90 days type thing but the the balance
seems to be a very good one and

02:15:10.229 --> 02:15:10.239
seems to be a very good one and
 

02:15:10.239 --> 02:15:14.050
seems to be a very good one and
hopefully the the pressure of being a

02:15:14.050 --> 02:15:14.060
hopefully the the pressure of being a
 

02:15:14.060 --> 02:15:17.439
hopefully the the pressure of being a
private sector company can put the right

02:15:17.439 --> 02:15:17.449
private sector company can put the right
 

02:15:17.449 --> 02:15:19.090
private sector company can put the right
sort of pressure on the innovation

02:15:19.090 --> 02:15:19.100
sort of pressure on the innovation
 

02:15:19.100 --> 02:15:21.550
sort of pressure on the innovation
engine because more and more that

02:15:21.550 --> 02:15:21.560
engine because more and more that
 

02:15:21.560 --> 02:15:23.800
engine because more and more that
innovation needs to be aligned with the

02:15:23.800 --> 02:15:23.810
innovation needs to be aligned with the
 

02:15:23.810 --> 02:15:25.959
innovation needs to be aligned with the
needs of a community or the business

02:15:25.959 --> 02:15:25.969
needs of a community or the business
 

02:15:25.969 --> 02:15:27.310
needs of a community or the business
otherwise it's not commercially viable

02:15:27.310 --> 02:15:27.320
otherwise it's not commercially viable
 

02:15:27.320 --> 02:15:28.570
otherwise it's not commercially viable
yeah

02:15:28.570 --> 02:15:28.580
yeah
 

02:15:28.580 --> 02:15:30.010
yeah
so I think hopefully I think we've got a

02:15:30.010 --> 02:15:30.020
so I think hopefully I think we've got a
 

02:15:30.020 --> 02:15:31.799
so I think hopefully I think we've got a
we got a pretty good balance on

02:15:31.799 --> 02:15:31.809
we got a pretty good balance on
 

02:15:31.809 --> 02:15:32.819
we got a pretty good balance on
you know we don't want to just innovate

02:15:32.819 --> 02:15:32.829
you know we don't want to just innovate
 

02:15:32.829 --> 02:15:35.399
you know we don't want to just innovate
for innovations sake yeah but we're

02:15:35.399 --> 02:15:35.409
for innovations sake yeah but we're
 

02:15:35.409 --> 02:15:36.659
for innovations sake yeah but we're
trying to make sure it's it's it's it's

02:15:36.659 --> 02:15:36.669
trying to make sure it's it's it's it's
 

02:15:36.669 --> 02:15:38.639
trying to make sure it's it's it's it's
it's a benefit to the planet and the

02:15:38.639 --> 02:15:38.649
it's a benefit to the planet and the
 

02:15:38.649 --> 02:15:39.779
it's a benefit to the planet and the
commercial side as well as the

02:15:39.779 --> 02:15:39.789
commercial side as well as the
 

02:15:39.789 --> 02:15:41.669
commercial side as well as the
educational side so if your change model

02:15:41.669 --> 02:15:41.679
educational side so if your change model
 

02:15:41.679 --> 02:15:44.099
educational side so if your change model
is is is you know connected to both

02:15:44.099 --> 02:15:44.109
is is is you know connected to both
 

02:15:44.109 --> 02:15:47.089
is is is you know connected to both
community and to product innovation into

02:15:47.089 --> 02:15:47.099
community and to product innovation into
 

02:15:47.099 --> 02:15:50.579
community and to product innovation into
profit obviously as well how is that

02:15:50.579 --> 02:15:50.589
profit obviously as well how is that
 

02:15:50.589 --> 02:15:53.520
profit obviously as well how is that
happening internal and I'll I'll say one

02:15:53.520 --> 02:15:53.530
happening internal and I'll I'll say one
 

02:15:53.530 --> 02:15:54.719
happening internal and I'll I'll say one
of the great things about Carnegie

02:15:54.719 --> 02:15:54.729
of the great things about Carnegie
 

02:15:54.729 --> 02:15:56.759
of the great things about Carnegie
Mellon is that you know we have people

02:15:56.759 --> 02:15:56.769
Mellon is that you know we have people
 

02:15:56.769 --> 02:15:58.709

architect and designer and thinking
 

02:16:00.459 --> 02:16:03.089
architect and designer and thinking
about how people make urban environments

02:16:03.089 --> 02:16:03.099
about how people make urban environments
 

02:16:03.099 --> 02:16:04.799
about how people make urban environments
but I was talking to one of my

02:16:04.799 --> 02:16:04.809
but I was talking to one of my
 

02:16:04.809 --> 02:16:06.750
but I was talking to one of my
colleagues 10 years ago who was working

02:16:06.750 --> 02:16:06.760
colleagues 10 years ago who was working
 

02:16:06.760 --> 02:16:09.619
colleagues 10 years ago who was working
in material sciences she's talking about

02:16:09.619 --> 02:16:09.629
in material sciences she's talking about
 

02:16:09.629 --> 02:16:11.969

boy you know we're just we need to get

02:16:11.969 --> 02:16:11.979
boy you know we're just we need to get
 

02:16:11.979 --> 02:16:13.679
boy you know we're just we need to get
to this point before these cool things

02:16:13.679 --> 02:16:13.689
to this point before these cool things
 

02:16:13.689 --> 02:16:15.029
to this point before these cool things
she's doing which eventually led to led

um
just weren't there yet and so we

02:16:18.719 --> 02:16:18.729
just weren't there yet and so we
 

02:16:18.729 --> 02:16:21.089
just weren't there yet and so we
recognized there was a gap between what

02:16:21.089 --> 02:16:21.099
recognized there was a gap between what
 

02:16:21.099 --> 02:16:24.959
recognized there was a gap between what
where we were I'm here who is Philips is

where we were I'm here who is Philips is
 

02:16:24.969 --> 02:16:27.809
where we were I'm here who is Philips is
kind of that the organization right now

02:16:27.809 --> 02:16:27.819
kind of that the organization right now
 

02:16:27.819 --> 02:16:29.369
kind of that the organization right now
that's filling that gap right between

02:16:29.369 --> 02:16:29.379
that's filling that gap right between
 

02:16:29.379 --> 02:16:31.709
that's filling that gap right between

applications to use lighting that you
 

02:18:45.809 --> 02:18:47.030
applications to use lighting that you
know we would never have come up with

02:18:47.030 --> 02:18:47.040
know we would never have come up with
 

02:18:47.040 --> 02:18:48.919

without that ecosystem and community
yeah so you really need to create that

02:18:50.450 --> 02:18:50.460
yeah so you really need to create that
 

02:18:50.460 --> 02:18:52.429
yeah so you really need to create that
ecosystem to support your product which

02:18:52.429 --> 02:18:52.439
ecosystem to support your product which
 

02:18:52.439 --> 02:18:54.020
ecosystem to support your product which
is so much more complex than when it was

02:18:54.020 --> 02:18:54.030
is so much more complex than when it was
 

02:18:54.030 --> 02:18:56.089

just providing lighting it is I don't

02:18:56.089 --> 02:18:56.099
just providing lighting it is I don't
 

02:18:56.099 --> 02:18:57.530
just providing lighting it is I don't
more other points I think it's a very

02:18:57.530 --> 02:18:57.540
more other points I think it's a very
 

02:18:57.540 --> 02:18:59.060
more other points I think it's a very
valid one right you know lighting in a

02:18:59.060 --> 02:18:59.070
valid one right you know lighting in a
 

02:18:59.070 --> 02:19:02.240
valid one right you know lighting in a
computing store and one of our one of

02:19:02.240 --> 02:19:02.250
computing store and one of our one of
 

02:19:02.250 --> 02:19:04.639
computing store and one of our one of
our challenges we move digitally is the

02:19:04.639 --> 02:19:04.649
our challenges we move digitally is the
 

02:19:04.649 --> 02:19:06.230
our challenges we move digitally is the
consumption of lighting at the moment

02:19:06.230 --> 02:19:06.240
consumption of lighting at the moment
 

02:19:06.240 --> 02:19:08.810
consumption of lighting at the moment
because historically we typically would

02:19:08.810 --> 02:19:08.820
because historically we typically would
 

02:19:08.820 --> 02:19:10.850
because historically we typically would
have gone to you know a major building

02:19:10.850 --> 02:19:10.860
have gone to you know a major building
 

02:19:10.860 --> 02:19:13.459
have gone to you know a major building
supplier or you know our standard

02:19:13.459 --> 02:19:13.469
supplier or you know our standard
 

02:19:13.469 --> 02:19:15.259
supplier or you know our standard
electrical play and all of a sudden it

02:19:15.259 --> 02:19:15.269
electrical play and all of a sudden it
 

02:19:15.269 --> 02:19:16.700
electrical play and all of a sudden it
does need to be in a computerized

02:19:16.700 --> 02:19:16.710
does need to be in a computerized
 

02:19:16.710 --> 02:19:19.250
does need to be in a computerized
environment and take that into the

02:19:19.250 --> 02:19:19.260
environment and take that into the
 

02:19:19.260 --> 02:19:21.350
environment and take that into the
business world and your background of

02:19:21.350 --> 02:19:21.360
business world and your background of
 

02:19:21.360 --> 02:19:23.480
business world and your background of
design and architecture right it's like

02:19:23.480 --> 02:19:23.490
design and architecture right it's like
 

02:19:23.490 --> 02:19:26.060
design and architecture right it's like
okay how do we talk differently to the

02:19:26.060 --> 02:19:26.070
okay how do we talk differently to the
 

02:19:26.070 --> 02:19:28.009
okay how do we talk differently to the
architectural community and the design

02:19:28.009 --> 02:19:28.019
architectural community and the design
 

02:19:28.019 --> 02:19:30.230

know it's not just you know 6,000 light

02:19:31.910 --> 02:19:31.920
know it's not just you know 6,000 light
 

02:19:31.920 --> 02:19:33.560
know it's not just you know 6,000 light
points in this room right what could you

02:19:33.560 --> 02:19:33.570
points in this room right what could you
 

02:19:33.570 --> 02:19:36.560
points in this room right what could you
do with you know 8,000 connected ones

02:19:36.560 --> 02:19:36.570
do with you know 8,000 connected ones
 

02:19:36.570 --> 02:19:38.570
do with you know 8,000 connected ones
that understand how that's linked to the

02:19:38.570 --> 02:19:38.580
that understand how that's linked to the
 

02:19:38.580 --> 02:19:40.910
that understand how that's linked to the
heating system or the tracking system to

02:19:40.910 --> 02:19:40.920
heating system or the tracking system to
 

02:19:40.920 --> 02:19:42.679
heating system or the tracking system to
get more efficiency and a better

02:19:42.679 --> 02:19:42.689
get more efficiency and a better
 

02:19:42.689 --> 02:19:46.639
get more efficiency and a better
experience in a room like this so I

02:19:46.639 --> 02:19:46.649
experience in a room like this so I
 

02:19:46.649 --> 02:19:48.139
experience in a room like this so I
think you did a great job actually of

02:19:48.139 --> 02:19:48.149
think you did a great job actually of
 

02:19:48.149 --> 02:19:51.139
think you did a great job actually of
connecting to the urban environment you

02:19:51.139 --> 02:19:51.149
connecting to the urban environment you
 

02:19:51.149 --> 02:19:52.520
connecting to the urban environment you
know we're not talking about just the

02:19:52.520 --> 02:19:52.530
know we're not talking about just the
 

02:19:52.530 --> 02:19:54.170
know we're not talking about just the
technology we're talking about the role

02:19:54.170 --> 02:19:54.180
technology we're talking about the role
 

02:19:54.180 --> 02:19:55.600
technology we're talking about the role
of it within the environment

02:19:55.600 --> 02:19:55.610
of it within the environment
 

02:19:55.610 --> 02:19:57.970
of it within the environment
another one of our assets here at CMU

02:19:57.970 --> 02:19:57.980
another one of our assets here at CMU
 

02:19:57.980 --> 02:20:00.790
another one of our assets here at CMU
jolt our has done Studies on how

02:20:00.790 --> 02:20:00.800
jolt our has done Studies on how
 

02:20:00.800 --> 02:20:02.620
jolt our has done Studies on how
lighting changed the way we behave in

02:20:02.620 --> 02:20:02.630
lighting changed the way we behave in
 

02:20:02.630 --> 02:20:04.511
lighting changed the way we behave in
cities when we first got electrification

02:20:04.511 --> 02:20:04.521
cities when we first got electrification
 

02:20:04.521 --> 02:20:06.730
cities when we first got electrification
so that's that's a big difference what

02:20:06.730 --> 02:20:06.740
so that's that's a big difference what
 

02:20:06.740 --> 02:20:08.680
so that's that's a big difference what
do you see as the future what's

02:20:08.680 --> 02:20:08.690
do you see as the future what's
 

02:20:08.690 --> 02:20:10.780
do you see as the future what's
different in a city not just visually

02:20:10.780 --> 02:20:10.790
different in a city not just visually
 

02:20:10.790 --> 02:20:14.020
different in a city not just visually
but performative ly because we're

02:20:14.020 --> 02:20:14.030
but performative ly because we're
 

02:20:14.030 --> 02:20:17.140
but performative ly because we're
implementing new technologies yeah and

02:20:17.140 --> 02:20:17.150
implementing new technologies yeah and
 

02:20:17.150 --> 02:20:19.511
implementing new technologies yeah and
there's multiple layers to that I think

02:20:19.511 --> 02:20:19.521
there's multiple layers to that I think
 

02:20:19.521 --> 02:20:20.890
there's multiple layers to that I think

question is so light frequencies and the
 

02:31:50.350 --> 02:31:53.219
question is so light frequencies and the
impact of light obviously how you use

02:31:53.219 --> 02:31:53.229
impact of light obviously how you use
 

02:31:53.229 --> 02:31:55.319
