00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Now we come to the first problem of Unit 2. This time we're still dealing with orbits.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
We have a pendulum and we want to create expressions

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
for the position, velocity, and acceleration.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
As always, we've given you some code to help you out.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Here you can see the time set, the magnitude of the acceleration due to gravity,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and the length of the pendulum, which is just the length of the

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
string to which the bulb of the pendulum is attached.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
What we're asking you to do is to first fill in this definition of the acceleration of the pendulum

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
showing how it depends on the position of the weight.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Now if you think about the way that a pendulum swings, you can imagine

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
that if we extend the trajectory, we would get a circle.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
So position is the length of this curve path.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
The next thing that you need to do is to fill in this function called symplectic Euler

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
in which logically you will use symplectic Euler method to calculate both distance and velocity.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
To help you out a little bit, here is a refresher on what the symplectic Euler method says.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Another important piece of information if you're not super-comfortable with physics stuff

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
is Newton's second law right here showing the relationship between force, mass, acceleration.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
So looking back at our code, you can see that we've created

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
empty arrays for you--for position and for velocity.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
It's up to you to fill these arrays in including the initial conditions.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Remember you'll need to initialize x and v where x is zero and v is zero

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
equals something that you're going to figure out.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
I'm going to give you a few hints though--you can see that we've created

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
this constant called num_initial condition and set it to equal to 50.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
What you're really doing overall in this problem is looking at 50 different pendulums

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
which each have different initial values for x and v, and to give you a visual of what this looks like,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
I'm going to show you the final plot that you'll get with this program.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
So here's the set of graph that you should get as your final result if the program is working correctly.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
You're going to ignore these top two graphs for now. Let's focus on this bottom plot.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
This is showing velocity on the vertical axis and position on the horizontal axis.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
If we look at the top two graphs, we can see that this green set of points right here

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
corresponds to what's happening at time zero.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Since green ellipse down here is showing the set of initial conditions

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
for the 50 different pendulums that we're looking at.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
This green ellipse is kind of like a snap shot of what's happening

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
to all these different pendulums at time zero.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
The way that I want you to figure out how to set

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
the values for each pendulum for x and for v is just think about this ellipse.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Now in Unit 1 you learned about orbits and you'll actually be able to use

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
some of that knowledge in this problem knowing that this green shape is an ellipse.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
You can see that its major axis right here lies along the line v=0

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
and its minor axis lies along this line x=2.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Now the half length of the major axis is 0.25

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
so I guess actually it don't looks like the major axis here.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:47.000
It's really the minor axis if these two sets of axes had the same scales applied to them.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Either way, this rightmost point on ellipse corresponds to x=2.25

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
and the leftmost point corresponds to x=1.75.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
In terms of v, we have values ranging from -2 down here to 2 up here.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.000
So think about what equations for x and v you'll need to create an ellipse with these dimensions.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
That would be how you set the initial conditions for x and v.

00:03:10.000 --> 09:59:59.000
I think this is a very interesting problem so I hope you enjoy doing it. Good luck.
