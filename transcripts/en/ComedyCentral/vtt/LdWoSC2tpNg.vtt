(laughing)

00:00:25.425 --> 00:00:26.893
Oh!

00:00:26.893 --> 00:00:27.727
You forgot the staples!

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.269

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:38.872
Oh no!

00:00:38.872 --> 00:00:40.140
- What's a matter, Bill?

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.508

00:00:47.047 --> 00:00:50.016 align:start size:97% position:3%
Yeah, I'm selling
magazines for school again,

00:00:50.016 --> 00:00:51.751
so I need a little bit of money.

00:00:53.153 --> 00:00:58.024 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Ethel, this is the spirit
of your dead husband.

00:00:58.024 --> 00:00:59.993
They won't release me from Hell,

00:00:59.993 --> 00:01:03.530
unless you buy some steaks.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.165

00:01:05.165 --> 00:01:07.600 align:start size:81% position:19%
I'm gonna need the
expiration date

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.803
and the three digit
code on the back.

00:01:09.803 --> 00:01:11.805
That is very good Doris,

00:01:11.805 --> 00:01:13.339
you pass your Alzheimer's test.

00:01:13.339 --> 00:01:15.175
Thank you very much!

00:01:15.175 --> 00:01:16.142

00:01:21.381 --> 00:01:22.849
- There's poop in it!

00:01:22.849 --> 00:01:23.983
There's poop in the dollar!

00:01:23.983 --> 00:01:25.218
- Look at that.

00:01:26.419 --> 00:01:28.154

00:01:28.154 --> 00:01:29.055

It's weird how
unembarassed I am by that.

00:01:35.695 --> 00:01:38.198
(alarm clock)

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:43.436

Aw!

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.171
(hair dryer blowing)

00:01:45.171 --> 00:01:46.539
No more pranks!

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:48.241
Okay, we're not in
college anymore!

00:01:48.241 --> 00:01:50.143
We're grown-ups, so act like it!

00:01:59.586 --> 00:02:00.620

00:02:04.724 --> 00:02:05.925

00:02:05.925 --> 00:02:07.393
- What do you mean?

00:02:07.393 --> 00:02:08.895 align:start size:94% position:6%
It's a coffee pot, is
that not coffee in there?

00:02:08.895 --> 00:02:10.396
- Is there not coffee?

00:02:10.396 --> 00:02:12.665
- Actually, Ders, don't you
mean flat Dr. Pepper pot?

00:02:12.665 --> 00:02:14.901
(laughing)

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:18.872
- Y'all ain't funny.

00:02:18.872 --> 00:02:20.507
- Oh my God!

00:02:20.507 --> 00:02:21.674
Oh my God, I can't breathe.

00:02:21.674 --> 00:02:23.910
I can't breathe, it's too funny.

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.078
Oh, it's too good of a prank.

00:02:25.078 --> 00:02:25.912
