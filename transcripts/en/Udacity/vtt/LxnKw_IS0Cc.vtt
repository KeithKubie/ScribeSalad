00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.530
In this lesson we have
learned what future many

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:06.820
core processors will probably look like.

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:08.710
This concludes the third and

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:13.380
final part of my high performance
computer architecture course.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.240
I hope you have enjoyed this journey
through the guts of a modern processor

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.200
core, through its memory hierarchy, and

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:25.060
through the intricacies of multi-core
and multi-threaded execution.

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.680
It was certainly a pleasure for
me to teach this course.
