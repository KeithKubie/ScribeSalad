bicycle way or both the second thing to
 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:49.220
bicycle way or both the second thing to
do is to charge for the cars coming

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230
do is to charge for the cars coming
 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.840

through the bridges which are free I

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850
through the bridges which are free I
 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.640
through the bridges which are free I
mean there are still many bridges I mean

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650
mean there are still many bridges I mean
 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.680

it is very easy to do congestion

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690
it is very easy to do congestion
 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.360
it is very easy to do congestion
charging in Manhattan because you don't

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370
charging in Manhattan because you don't
 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:57.949

really have to do congestion charging
you just have to charge for crossing the

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090
you just have to charge for crossing the
 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.890
you just have to charge for crossing the
bridges so it's a little even

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900
bridges so it's a little even
 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.000

contradictory to have congestion

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010
contradictory to have congestion
 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.550

I think in many areas of New York you

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410
I think in many areas of New York you
 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.990
I think in many areas of New York you
will need to improve I mean New York has

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000
will need to improve I mean New York has

many places there are many places which
 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.449
many places there are many places which
are underserved by public transport so

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459
are underserved by public transport so
 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:03.460
are underserved by public transport so
