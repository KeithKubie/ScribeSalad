00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.960
What's up guys, we are back in the workshop today

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:03.000
with my Miter Saw,

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.300
because for today's project, we're playing with wood.

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.580
Now, in yesterday's video we tried making something called called GreenSand,

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:12.280
which is basically play sand that you can use for casting metals.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.240
And I went ahead and mixed up a whole bunch more,

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.820
so now we've got about 25 pounds of GreenSand just ready to be used.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.180
So the good news is, we now have some good quality sand to work with,

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.340
the bad news is, we still need a sand-box to use it with.

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.080
So that's what we're doing here today,

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:31.420
with some simple and low cost materials we're building ourselves a set of metal casting sand-boxes.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:32.980
Now I just ran down to the hardware store,

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.600
and picked up one of these eight foot
lengths of one by three pine board.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.300
These things are extremely cheap extremely
common and the two things you want to

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.540
watch for is to get a piece that doesn't
have too many knots in it and make sure

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.450
it's relatively straight when you look
down the edge now to keep things

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.050
relatively simple our first sand box is
going to be on the smaller side we can

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.629
get started making it by cutting our
length of pine board into eight

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:58.479
sections seven inches long

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.370
So update guys all of our eight pieces
are now cut and all of them are exactly

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:19.330
the same length. In fact just to be sure
after they were cut I lined all them up

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.630
together and sliced one more time down
the edge just to make sure they lined up

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.080
perfectly smooth. Now since we were
chopping up wood anyway and we had some

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.280
leftover I cut these two pieces five
inches long and another piece 20 inches

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.370
long and you'll see what all these are
for in just a minute. So here's the basic idea.

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.280
We're gonna take these four pieces
of wood and set them down on the table

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.180
so two pieces are parallel to each other
and we'll use the other two pieces to

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.180
cap them from the top of the bottom now
because we're going to be ramming sand

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.509
into our system we want to screw these
together. But just for convenience I'm

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:48.820
gonna be using my brad nailer to tack
them together and hold them in place

00:01:48.820 --> 00:02:03.030
until we can drill some pilot holes and
set the screws.

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.050
So here we are guys I went ahead and
drilled pilot holes in each of the four

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.830
corners and added a screw to bind them
down tightly and now we have two nearly

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.280
identical wooden frames that fit
together just about perfectly. Now the

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.680
purpose of the screws in the corners
here is to bind the wooden pieces

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.860
together tight because once we start
ramming sand down in there it's going to

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.160
apply a lot of pressure to the inside
walls if it's just nails holding that in

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.040
there it's going to fall apart.
All right cool. So we got our two little

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.100
box frames finished let's go ahead and
bring back these 5-inch pieces now and

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.860
use them to create some latches.

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:09.849
Now if you look really closely at these
blocks you can see I've just cut little

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:12.489
triangles out of them and I did that by
stacking them together so they're

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:16.180
perfectly symmetrical, and using the edge
of another piece of board as a guide to

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.870
draw a triangle. Both of these pieces
went into the jaws of my bench vise to

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.139
be held securely in place where I could
then use a jig saw to trace out the

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:26.530
pattern. So now we have two little wooden
puzzle pieces whose triangles fit

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.840
perfectly inside.
Let's go attach them to the box.

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.360
We're going to need these wooden frames stacked
together as perfectly as possible, so for

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.219
convenience I'm gonna be using clamps.
They're not necessary but it is going to

00:03:36.219 --> 00:03:39.430
make a job a lot easier.
take your block of wood and flip it

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.359
around so your triangle is pointing
upward and separate the two pieces and

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:46.599
place them on the side of your box. We want to place this on the side of our

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:50.169
box with a triangle on the bottom piece
facing upward it's very important that

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:53.709
the tip of it is below the centre line.
When the spacing looks good you can take

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:57.879
the second piece and lock it into place
on top of the triangle. Center everything

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:04.539
up so that it looks good, and then go
ahead and screw it into place.

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:32.050
So check it out guys, our little metal
casting sandbox is just about finished.

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.680
You can see I used two screws to screw
the triangle into place and then two

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.190
screws on the top support as well as to
temporary screws on the bottom support.

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:43.270
Those are designed to come out and when
they do, the two halves will separate.

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:46.270
And for convenience you can see I've added a
few extra markings because once the two

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.780
sides separate it's important to know
which way they go back together. On the

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.169
two ends I drew two lines and added some
arrowheads so we know exactly where

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:56.560
these are supposed to line up, and on the
front side I put an F on the triangle as

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.910
well as the top piece, and the back side
got the letter B. See now the system is

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:04.460
foolproof because if you try and put it
together backwards it won't fit and it

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:08.920
will tell you why flip it around and it
goes together like a glove.

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.960
So there we have it guys, our little wooden sandbox
is finished and ready for

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.360
metal casting. And just for fun I put together a couple
more so we have a couple of different

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.259
options for casting different size items.
They're made exactly the same the only

00:05:20.259 --> 00:05:24.430
difference is this box is 10 by 10
whereas this is 7 by 7. And you can see

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:27.509
what a dramatic difference that extra
three inches makes to the volume inside.

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:31.210
Alright cool, so our sound boxes are made
but there are a couple more tools we're

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:34.630
going to need before we jump into our
metal casting projects so let's make

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:37.080
those next.

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:02.280
So quick update guys, I just took a few
minutes and put together a whole array

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.740
of new tools. Let me show you what we got.

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.440
First of all I used some half-inch MDF to

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:10.110
make some molding boards you can see on
the back they've got base rails these

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:13.020
are designed to sit on top of our boxes
and hold the sand in place as we flip

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:14.160
them over. We also have a scrap piece of 1 by 3,

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.680
and this is gonna be used as a straight edge
to help level off the sand.

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:20.550
Next up we've got a couple of ramming

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:24.330
tools. These are simply 8-inch lengths of
2x2 and are used for pounding the sand

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:28.230
into place. I also cut a couple of 8-inch lengths of these one and a quarter

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:32.010
inch dowels to act as sprues and I threw
one of them on the belt sander for a few

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:34.320
minutes to give it this tapered edge
which should help it pop out a little

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:37.920
bit cleaner. If we need our sprues to be
a little thinner in diameter, I cut some

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:41.820
3/4 inch PVC that should serve the same
purpose, and I cut out a piece of 12

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:45.210
gauge home electrical wire that we can
use to poke vent holes.

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:47.970
This funny-looking piece of metal here is a
strip that I cut from the bottom of an

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:51.330
Altoids tin and it's a tool we can use
to carve out some channels or gates

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:54.720
leading to the castings we're going to
make. It almost sounds like I know what

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:57.930
I'm talking about but I don't. This is
actually my first experience my first

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:00.780
attempt with any of this and the purpose
of these videos is to share my

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:04.620
experiences with you as I do. We've got
our sand we've got our tools so the next

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:08.340
thing to try is green sand casting.
Thanks for joining me for this project guys

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:11.840
hope you learned something new, I'll see
you the next video, talk to you then.

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:15.220
Cool-looking box actually, I don't even
know what they're called.

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:17.680
Metal casting sand boxes, sure.

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:20.500
