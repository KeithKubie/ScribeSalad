00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 The eternal problem is: how do you deal with tragedy and evil? 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.080
 And you can say, "I'm not ready." Yeah fine. 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.440
 Not surprising, especially if you were too protected as a child. 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.820
 it is not a good idea to protect children too much 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.420
 because snakes are coming into the garden anyway 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.400
 so instead of driving away snakes 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.460
 You have to arm your child with something that will help them cut the snakes into pieces. 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.040
 And make them a world. 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:34.840
 The trick to flourish people in the face of suffering and evil is strength, not protection. 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.840
 It's completely different. We also know it from practice. 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.580
 For example, we know that when you treat agoraphobia by exhibiting, 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:47.240
 which is, roughly speaking, a fear of chaos, fear of everything. 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.420
 You don't want them to be less afraid, but to be more brave " 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:56.040
 It's not the same because agoraphobics have this problem: 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.770
 They cannot imagine death and suffering. 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.900
 They are naive, that there is no imagination in the theater, 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.740
 because they are protected before. 

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:08.180
 But then something happens, this often happens to women in their forties, 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.180
 because agoraphobia most often develops. 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.799
 Something happens, the authorities have protected them from chaos for life. 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.460
 So maybe they had too protective a father 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.660
 and they went to a too protective friend and then a husband 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:29.820
 and maybe they were willing to blame everyone for the protection. 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.120
 This is an agreement - they will remain weak and dependent, but they may, 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.770
 because only then will they attract a person who is hyper-protective. 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.100
 but the price is that they are not strong enough. 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.380
 And then something happens in their lives, often in their forties, 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.560
 they develop heart palpitations, possibly as a result of menopause. 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.860
 Their heart starts to beat furiously, and they think they will die. 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.080
 Well, with whom do you talk about it, right? 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.220
 The authority will not protect you from this. 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.180
 Or maybe their friends divorce or the sister dies or something. 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.260
 It provokes a specter of mortality and perhaps a specter of evil and mortality. 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.960
 And so that escape to authority cannot solve it. 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.640
 So they get a panic attack. 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.660
 They go out, scare, feel their heart beating, 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.180
 then they are terrified because of their heart, because they think, "Now I'm going to die". 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.300
 And they will say: 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.420
 "I will die and make myself a fool because I will draw a lot of attention." 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.820
 So two big fears will be: death and public embarrassment. 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.540
 Then they get a panic attack, primitive instincts get out of control. 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.020
 Very uncomfortable. 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.980
 Then they start to avoid places where they have a panic attack 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.200
 and finally they can't go anywhere. 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.520
 Tiamat returned. Big monster, little victim. 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.420
 And what do you do with them? 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.940
 You can't say Tiamat doesn't exist. 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.400
 It is not possible. They're no longer naive. 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.790
 They had direct contact with the threat of death and social court. 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.700
 They met a terrible mother and a terrible father and there is no way back. 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.400
 You can't say "The world is safe". 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.020
 It's not safe at all. Not safe. 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.939
 If you think it's safe, you live in a naive bubble, 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.080
 that culture gave you. It's a gift. 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.040
 And now shattered and what do you do now? 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.940
 You hide at home and you can't go anywhere. 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.140
 You're a petrified rabbit. 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.120
 And life is hell because you can't work. 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.360
 The alternative is to: take apart the things you are afraid of. 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.780
 We'll expose you to them. Careful and orderly. 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.060
 And then you learn that you're tougher than you thought. 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.040
 You didn't know it! And maybe you didn't want to take that responsibility, 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.860
 because people are the creators of their misfortune. 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.020
 When you had the opportunity to go out and explore 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:01.340
 or to withdraw the fear, you have chosen to withdraw with fear. 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.720
 It's not just that you were too protected, 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.020
 Often you were willing to take advantage of being protected 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:11.320
 and you escaped whenever you could. 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.780
 Maybe you were a kid on the playground and you had a problem with other kids. 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.180
 And deep in your mind you know that you should deal with it yourself. 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.580
 But you go and tell your mom and let her hit. 

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:23.280
 And you know it's not right. 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.580
 You know you're breaking a social rule, but it's easier. 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:33.140
 So you run to authority and hide behind a big father, right? 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:36.140
 The problem is that you don't learn it yourself. 

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:39.380
 And then you have to learn it painfully when you're 40. 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.620
 So you go out with people. 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.980
 You say, "What are you afraid of? Number it 1-10." 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:51.420
 Make a list of the 10 things you're afraid of. 

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:55.520
 10 is what you fear the least. Let's start with it. "I'm afraid of elevators" 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.160
 Okay, let's take a look at the elevator picture. 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.140
 Imagine you are in the elevator. 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:05.660
 Go out and see how the horrible jaws of death open, 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:08.740
 because that's how you react symbolically to it. 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:14.840
 And you go as close as you can. 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.300
 You go and it works. You're very nervous 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:21.660
 especially because of expectations. 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:25.940
 You are shivering, going out, stopping, looking and calming down. 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:28.580
 You do it ten times and you're fine. 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:32.800
 You've learned that you don't die, but more importantly, 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:37.580
 You have learned that you can withstand the threat of death. 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.540
 And then you go a little closer, and then a little closer 

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:47.020
 And finally you are back in what is not an elevator, symbolically it is a tomb 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:50.500
 It's a closed and isolated place. 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:54.100
 And you will learn: "Hmm, it turns out I will stand." 

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:58.260
 And then you're more together, much more confident. 

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.750
 And what often happens in such situations, 

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:04.080
 I've seen it several times, 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:09.600
 When someone goes through this exposure process and gets rough, 

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:13.420
 they often start building other people like never before, 

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:16.480
 because he could not stand up for himself, 

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:20.280
 because he didn't want to undermine the protection. 

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:24.120
 If you protect me, I can't resist you, 

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:28.200
 because I can't afford to lose your protection. 

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.840
 So if I play this, I'll hide for you, 

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.600
 then I can't challenge you. 

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:35.480
 That's not good because ... 

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:39.140
 you often see it in men, 

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:44.000
 he is still afraid of the father's opinion when he is 30-40. 

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.080
 Why? 

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:48.800
 Because they want to believe someone out there knows. 

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.540
 so they are willing to accept the subordination, 

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:55.560
 because it does not force them to question the idea that there is someone out there who knows. 

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:59.300
 Because that's the advantage of a father as a judge, right? 

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:00.560
 He knows. 

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:01.960
 And what if not? 

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:06.280
 What if someone doesn't know better than you? Well, that's hard. 

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:09.160
 Until you realize it, you're not an adult, are you? 

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:12.780
 This is technically the point of reaching adulthood. 

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:16.020
 Nobody knows what you should do better than you do. 

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:19.280
 It's a terrible finding because what the hell do you know? 

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:23.540
 It's a terrible finding and people often choose slavery ... 

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:29.260
 Permanent slavery to the spirit of the great father before finding it, and it is understandable. 

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.700
 But the problem with this is that you have more than you think 

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:35.600
 and when you hide behind that person 

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:39.400
 you will never have a chance to understand that there is more in you than you think 

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:41.020
 much more than you think. 

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:42.860
 Maybe there's so much in you 

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:48.440
 that you will endure the threat of death without asking you. 

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:51.740
 You may even put an end to the threat of evil without asking you to. 

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:54.700
 Who knows? It's definitely possible. 

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:56.980
 And it's not an abstract question. 

00:07:56.980 --> 00:08:02.000
 It is exactly the question you are dealing with during psychotherapy. 

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.080
 You always address this question and the answer is often positive. 

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:09.440
 Because people can be incredibly argued. 

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:13.700
 And you know that because people work in the emergency room in hospitals 

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:18.600
 or work in palliative care or morgue. 

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:20.740
 These people have damn hard work. 

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:26.580
 Or they are at the forefront of investigating child abuse 

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:29.500
 so they regularly meet evil, 

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:33.620
 These are very stressful jobs, but people do them, 

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:37.800
 Some people even do it without damaging them. 

00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:40.960
 But that's harder because you can see scary things 

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:42.560
 you will never forget.
