00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:03.900
The designer has a clear conceptual model,

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:07.190
of how a product works. But when users

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:11.345
interact with a product, designers aren't present. Users

00:00:11.345 --> 00:00:13.901
have to get their conceptual model from the

00:00:13.901 --> 00:00:17.560
product system image. When interacting with a

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.460
product, we can't talk to designers to understand

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.700
their conceptual model. So we rely on whatever

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.680
information we can find out about the product.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:32.009
&gt;From it's shape, form, signifiers, affordances. And even instruction manuals.

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:37.510
This information combined, is what we call the system image.
