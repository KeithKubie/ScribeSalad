00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
What is it we have seen? We have started with an initial hypothesis.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
&gt;From this hypothesis we have made predictions. We have made experiments.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
We checked with the experiments, validated the prediction.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
If they did, we refined our hypothesis. If they didn't, we came up with alternate hypothesis.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
We have repeated the process until we came up with a diagnosis.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
That is, a theory that is consistent with our earlier observations, and that also

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
predicts future observations. In our case, the correct behavior.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Based on this diagnosis, how the failure came to be, we have fixed a code

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
accordingly, and we have seen in our additional experiments that the theory holds.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
That is, the diagnosis was valid from the beginning on,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and therefore, was a correct explanation of how the failure came to be.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Note that there are many ways to come up with an initial hypothesis.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
There are also many ways to refine a hypothesis and reject a hypothesis.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Note that there may be multiple hypotheses to start with,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and also of course during the scientific method, you may come up with different hypotheses.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
If you have two competing hypotheses for the same failure,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
what you do is set up an experiment that decides which of the hypotheses

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
is supported, and which of the hypotheses is rejected.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
At the end, there should be only one hypothesis, there should be only one

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
theory, and there should be only one diagnosis on how the failure came to be.
