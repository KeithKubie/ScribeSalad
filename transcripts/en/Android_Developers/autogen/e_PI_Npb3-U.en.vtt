user expectations that have gone up way
 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.080
user expectations that have gone up way
up let me just pick on two use cases at

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090
up let me just pick on two use cases at
 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.630

want these kinds of devices and we know
 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.580
want these kinds of devices and we know
we could build them but of course

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590
we could build them but of course
 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.770
we could build them but of course
building these exceeds is actually very

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780
building these exceeds is actually very
 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.870
building these exceeds is actually very
hard especially maintaining them over

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880
hard especially maintaining them over
 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.290
hard especially maintaining them over
time it's actually very expensive to do

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300
time it's actually very expensive to do
 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.420

this we notice that Google because we've

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430
this we notice that Google because we've
 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.890
this we notice that Google because we've
been shipping these kinds of products

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900
been shipping these kinds of products
 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.420
been shipping these kinds of products
well what's so hard

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430
well what's so hard
 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.310
well what's so hard
well first off we're talking about an

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320
well first off we're talking about an
 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.520

way up to the product experience now of
 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.350
way up to the product experience now of
course the product experience is where

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360
course the product experience is where
 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.479

you'd ideally be wanted to spend most of
 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.400
you'd ideally be wanted to spend most of
your time because that's where users are

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410
your time because that's where users are
 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.520
your time because that's where users are
spending interacting with below the
