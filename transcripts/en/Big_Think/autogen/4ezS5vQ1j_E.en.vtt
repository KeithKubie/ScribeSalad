decision in the United States I was a
 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.040
decision in the United States I was a
decision rating relating to a woman's

right to have an abortion it introduced

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:14.090
right to have an abortion it introduced

right to have an abortion it introduced
the trimester framework it basically

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:16.009
the trimester framework it basically
 

00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:18.310
the trimester framework it basically
allowed first trimester abortions made

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:18.320
allowed first trimester abortions made
 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.330
allowed first trimester abortions made
it very difficult to have third

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:19.340
it very difficult to have third
 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.720
it very difficult to have third
trimester abortions and essentially this

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:22.730
trimester abortions and essentially this
 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:24.519
trimester abortions and essentially this
was really met very quickly thereafter

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:24.529
was really met very quickly thereafter
 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:26.589
was really met very quickly thereafter
with the sort of backlash and really the

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:26.599
with the sort of backlash and really the
 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:30.040
with the sort of backlash and really the
last 4050 years of American history have

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050
last 4050 years of American history have
 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.920
last 4050 years of American history have
more or less been a backlash against her

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930
more or less been a backlash against her
 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:34.479
more or less been a backlash against her
every wait an attempt to kind of

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:34.489
every wait an attempt to kind of
 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:36.310
every wait an attempt to kind of
criminalize abortion and all sorts of

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320
criminalize abortion and all sorts of
 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.710
criminalize abortion and all sorts of
interesting ways without overturning the

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:38.720
interesting ways without overturning the
 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.390
interesting ways without overturning the
decision facially so that's kind of a

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:40.400
decision facially so that's kind of a
 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.220
decision facially so that's kind of a
legal playing field and we can talk

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:42.230
legal playing field and we can talk
 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.560
legal playing field and we can talk
about some of the specifics but the more

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570
about some of the specifics but the more
 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:45.640
about some of the specifics but the more
interesting question I think is thinking

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:45.650
interesting question I think is thinking
 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.140
interesting question I think is thinking
about the morality of abortion and I'll

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:47.150
about the morality of abortion and I'll
 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.120
about the morality of abortion and I'll
say that I think abortion it's extremely

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:49.130
say that I think abortion it's extremely
 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.640
say that I think abortion it's extremely
difficult question so one of the first

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:51.650
difficult question so one of the first
 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:53.290
difficult question so one of the first
questions people have to think about is

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.300
questions people have to think about is

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.470
are fetuses persons now that's a very
important linguistic question persons I

important linguistic question persons I
 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:00.970
important linguistic question persons I
didn't say human beings I didn't say

alive those are three different issues
 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.160
alive those are three different issues
right something can be alive but not be

a person your dog is a good example you

a person your dog is a good example you
love your dog it's a wonderful thing but

love your dog it's a wonderful thing but
 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.360
love your dog it's a wonderful thing but
it's not a person something can be human

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:13.370
it's not a person something can be human
 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:15.700
it's not a person something can be human
and potentially not be a person right

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710
and potentially not be a person right
 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.160

can't be killed or destroyed or harmed
 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.760
can't be killed or destroyed or harmed
without very good reason and we have the

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770
without very good reason and we have the
 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.920
without very good reason and we have the
attitude that we're all persons right so

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930
attitude that we're all persons right so
 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:43.570
attitude that we're all persons right so
we have an index case we're pretty clear

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:43.580
we have an index case we're pretty clear
 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.730
we have an index case we're pretty clear
we're persons and the question is who

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740
we're persons and the question is who
 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.179
we're persons and the question is who
else is a person well to answer that you

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:49.189
else is a person well to answer that you
 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:50.980
else is a person well to answer that you
need to have a theory about what makes

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990
need to have a theory about what makes
 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:52.840
need to have a theory about what makes
something a person and there are a few

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850
something a person and there are a few
 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.130
something a person and there are a few
different kinds of theories you can have

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140
different kinds of theories you can have
 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.370
different kinds of theories you can have
one could be just to say if X is living

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380
one could be just to say if X is living
 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.270
one could be just to say if X is living
and a human being X is a person right

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280
and a human being X is a person right
 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.070
and a human being X is a person right
now some people have problems with that

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080
now some people have problems with that
 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.020
now some people have problems with that
so Peter Singer and some animal rights

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030
so Peter Singer and some animal rights
 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:06.850
so Peter Singer and some animal rights
advocates for example think that that's

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860
advocates for example think that that's
 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.009
advocates for example think that that's
a speciesist attitude and by saying

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:09.019
a speciesist attitude and by saying
 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:11.440
a speciesist attitude and by saying
human equals person what's problematic

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450
human equals person what's problematic
 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.720
human equals person what's problematic
that we're excluding animals instead we

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730
that we're excluding animals instead we
 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.280
that we're excluding animals instead we
ought to have some criteria that looks

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290
ought to have some criteria that looks
 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.980
ought to have some criteria that looks
at capacity so other people have some

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990
at capacity so other people have some
 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.830
at capacity so other people have some
is what a call to capacity X view where

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840
is what a call to capacity X view where
 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.930
is what a call to capacity X view where
they say in order to be a person you

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940
they say in order to be a person you
 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.750
they say in order to be a person you
have to have X capacity and then we have

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760
have to have X capacity and then we have
 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.940
have to have X capacity and then we have
to fill in what X is is that the ability

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950
to fill in what X is is that the ability
 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.010
to fill in what X is is that the ability
to think complex thoughts the ability to

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020
to think complex thoughts the ability to
 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.200
to think complex thoughts the ability to
plan and look towards the future the

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:32.210
plan and look towards the future the
 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:34.270
plan and look towards the future the
ability to feel pain whether you

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280
ability to feel pain whether you
 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.100
ability to feel pain whether you
understand it it's about continuity of

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110
understand it it's about continuity of
 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.800
understand it it's about continuity of
an identity over time or is it merely

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810
an identity over time or is it merely
 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.440
an identity over time or is it merely
being alive and breathing and some

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450
being alive and breathing and some
 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.030
being alive and breathing and some
people think it's a single criteria

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040
people think it's a single criteria
 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.100
people think it's a single criteria
other thinks it's a compound criteria

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110
other thinks it's a compound criteria
 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.260
other thinks it's a compound criteria
and then there are complex questions

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270
and then there are complex questions
 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.300
and then there are complex questions
about what happens for things that have

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310
about what happens for things that have
 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.030
about what happens for things that have
the potential to have capacity X or had

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040
the potential to have capacity X or had
 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.420
the potential to have capacity X or had
capacity X but lost it so for example a

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430
capacity X but lost it so for example a
 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.510
capacity X but lost it so for example a
fetus doesn't have the ability as early

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:58.520
fetus doesn't have the ability as early
 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.400
fetus doesn't have the ability as early
fetus let's just say an embryo just to

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410
fetus let's just say an embryo just to
 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.350
fetus let's just say an embryo just to
make it very easy an embryo before 14

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360
make it very easy an embryo before 14
 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.050
make it very easy an embryo before 14
days doesn't have the capacity to think

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060
days doesn't have the capacity to think
 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.760
days doesn't have the capacity to think
deep thoughts about the future have

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:06.770
deep thoughts about the future have
 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:08.260
deep thoughts about the future have
future orientation I think that's pretty

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:08.270
future orientation I think that's pretty
 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:10.390
future orientation I think that's pretty
well accepted by everyone but it

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400
well accepted by everyone but it
 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.190
well accepted by everyone but it
certainly has the potential to do so

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200
certainly has the potential to do so
 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.230
certainly has the potential to do so
right and the question is is that enough

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:14.240
right and the question is is that enough
 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.290
right and the question is is that enough
what kind of theory of potentiality you

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:17.300
what kind of theory of potentiality you
 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.600
what kind of theory of potentiality you
know hydrogen and oxygen each have the

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610
know hydrogen and oxygen each have the
 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.000
know hydrogen and oxygen each have the
potential together to become water but

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010
potential together to become water but
 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:23.410
potential together to become water but
does that mean that they are water they

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420
does that mean that they are water they
 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.000
does that mean that they are water they
have the metaphysical properties of

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010
have the metaphysical properties of
 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.460
have the metaphysical properties of
water or do we require more of a kind of

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470
water or do we require more of a kind of
 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.140
water or do we require more of a kind of
potentiality something like in the

about that thought experiment right you

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:57.590
about that thought experiment right you
 

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:59.260
about that thought experiment right you
might say you got drunk no fault of your

00:05:59.260 --> 00:05:59.270
might say you got drunk no fault of your

really the situation of all women who
become pregnant or is it the situation

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:04.910
become pregnant or is it the situation
 

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:07.450

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:11.780
unconscious state but this is just to
 

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:13.360
unconscious state but this is just to
show that there's some complexity here

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:13.370
show that there's some complexity here
 

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:15.460
show that there's some complexity here
okay one more point that is that the

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:15.470
okay one more point that is that the
 

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:17.260
okay one more point that is that the
stem cell question look is different on

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:17.270
stem cell question look is different on
 

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:19.090
stem cell question look is different on
this regard remember when we're talking

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:19.100
this regard remember when we're talking
 

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:20.560
this regard remember when we're talking
about embryos we're talking about

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:20.570
about embryos we're talking about
 

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:21.970
about embryos we're talking about

a contrary right to stop just stating
them so you might actually think the

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:32.840
them so you might actually think the
 

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:34.750
them so you might actually think the
argument for prohibition against

argument for prohibition against
 

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:37.990
argument for prohibition against
destroying early embryos is easier than

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:38.000
destroying early embryos is easier than
 

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.610
destroying early embryos is easier than
the argument for prohibiting abortion

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:39.620
the argument for prohibiting abortion
 

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:42.280
the argument for prohibiting abortion
for this reason now the flip side you

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:42.290
for this reason now the flip side you
 

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:44.600
for this reason now the flip side you
might think the early embryos that even
