inadequate to do the things you

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040
inadequate to do the things you
 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.459

mentioned however with the addition of

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469
mentioned however with the addition of
 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.490
mentioned however with the addition of
technology it is very easy to imagine a

time in the future when we would have

00:00:15.439 --> 00:00:15.449
time in the future when we would have
 

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:19.370
time in the future when we would have
super senses for example our eyeball can

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380
super senses for example our eyeball can
 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.220
super senses for example our eyeball can
only see red green and blue the primary

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230
only see red green and blue the primary
 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.440
only see red green and blue the primary
colors but animals can see different

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:24.450
colors but animals can see different
 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:26.290

colors bees for example can see

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:26.300
colors bees for example can see
 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.880
colors bees for example can see
ultraviolet radiation that's how they

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890
ultraviolet radiation that's how they
 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.100
ultraviolet radiation that's how they
lock on to the Sun when it's raining and

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:31.110
lock on to the Sun when it's raining and
 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:33.410
lock on to the Sun when it's raining and
it's cloudy you think that bees would

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420
it's cloudy you think that bees would
 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.150
it's cloudy you think that bees would
starve to death because they don't know

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160
starve to death because they don't know
 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.610

where the flower patch is wrong they

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620
where the flower patch is wrong they
 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.010
where the flower patch is wrong they
lock onto the Sun and in under

ultraviolet radiation bees can see the
 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.160
ultraviolet radiation bees can see the
Sun so for us however we can't see

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170
Sun so for us however we can't see
 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.080
Sun so for us however we can't see
infrared we can't see ultraviolet

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090
infrared we can't see ultraviolet
 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.630

look at them with their x-ray vision so

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130
look at them with their x-ray vision so
 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.780
look at them with their x-ray vision so
and even telepathy we have certain forms

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790
and even telepathy we have certain forms
 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.320
and even telepathy we have certain forms
of telepathy even today by putting MRI

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330
of telepathy even today by putting MRI
 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.590
of telepathy even today by putting MRI
scans and EEG scans onto our brainwaves

through an MRI you can actually tell if
