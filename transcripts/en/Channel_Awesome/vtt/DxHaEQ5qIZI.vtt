Hey, Doug Walker here.

00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:06.000
If you look online right now you see everybody's talking about net neutrality. There's a good reason!

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.979
We've been putting off this video for a bit to find the best time to get the best bump that can be the most useful;

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:12.720
Now is the time.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.380
On December 14th, the vote for the Internet as we know it will be held

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.160
and the FCC (Federal Communications Commission) under Ajit Pai has shown to be one that doesn't care what the consumer or the public thinks.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:29.360
Mr Pai has refused to cooperate with the New York Attorney General regarding all the oddities surrounding the previous public comment period.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:34.620
Mr Pai has called net neutrality supporters desperate. He also just had a closed-door meeting with Verizon in DC.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:41.740
He's even refused to delay the vote even though there's a very important case going on in the US Court of Appeals Ninth Circuit.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.460
That case being the FTC (Federal Trade Commision) versus AT&amp;T Mobility.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:50.960
Pretty much any company as long as they buy or set up a phone or internet service provider can avoid

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:56.840
protection actions from the FTC. and in this case if that ruling is not repealed the FCC will shift

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.260
responsibility for handling net neutrality complaints to the FTC.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.199
What that means is they will have limited options for fighting for you then.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:08.620
This makes it much easier for people and sites to be abused by big corporations

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.540
I know what you're thinking. "Oh come on that won't happen." It already has!

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:18.060
Comcast, AT&amp;T, Verizon, Sprint and many others have tried to manipulate the system..

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.049
But were stopped!

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:24.329
If net neutrality is gutted, they won't be able to stop them! Now, these examples are usually done for one of two reasons.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.259
One, they want you to pay more or, two, they want you to use a crappy service

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.899
they just invented over the much better one that you're currently using.

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:37.079
Everyone can see them doing this and they think we're not gonna do anything about it, that we're just gonna pay for it!

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:43.100
This may even interfere with state rights as the FCC wants to block individual states from making their own net neutrality rules.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.060
This will most likely result in what Portugal is going through now, a country with no net neutrality.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.280
That means saying hello to additional tiers and fees!

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.520
Use Facebook, YouTube, Gmail, and Spotify? Guess what? You're in for additional tiers now!

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.720
So what can we do? We can make some noise!

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.900
Not with the FCC but with your local and federal representatives.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.300
There's just two things you need to do:

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.100
go to battle for the net dot com (battleforthenet.com) and call your members of the House and Senate.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.720
And then go to your state's website and find your local representative and call them.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.859
And just tell them you want net neutrality passed in your state.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.560
It's that simple..but we all got to do it!

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.920
However, if you like to do more, you can donate to the EFF or the ACLU.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.420
Trust me, they'll be fighting for all of us in the future.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.300
Links to everything I was talking about as well as other videos

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.760
discussing net neutrality and ways to give to the EFF and the ACLU are all below.

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:34.888
Thank you for watching and be sure to share this with your friends and family.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.600
They're trying to make us lose this battle, but we can still win the war.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.140
They say "freedom isn't free; you always gotta fight for it"

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.980
Well, the government is trying to make us *pay* for it. I'd rather fight first!

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.520
Hoin the fight and spread the word.

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.530
Thank you so much for listening.
