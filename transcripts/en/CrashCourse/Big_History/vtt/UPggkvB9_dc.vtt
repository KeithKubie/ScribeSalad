00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
Hi, I'm John Green. Welcome to Crash Course
Big History Project where today we're going

00:00:04.029 --> 00:00:10.060
to talk about the Planet of the Apes films. - What's
that? Apparently, those were not documentaries.

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:15.140
But there was an evolutionary process that
saw primates move out of East Africa and transform

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.290
the earth into an actual planet of the apes...but
the apes are us.

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:25.450
And then we made the movie and then some prequels
and some sequels and some reboots and now sequels to the reboots.

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:29.980
Man, I can't wait until I get to see the 2018
reboot of this episode of Crash Course Big

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.230
History I hear they get James Franco to play
me.

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:41.150
[Theme Music]

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.360
So we're about halfway through our series
and after five episodes involving no humans

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.620
whatsoever today we are finally gonna get
some people.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.130
Mr. Green, Mr. Green! Why are we already at
humanity, I mean if we're covering 13.8 billion

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:57.450
years shouldn't humanity come in like, the
last two seconds of the last episode? I mean

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.190
humans are totally insignificant compared
to the vastness of the universe, like we should

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.210
be checking in on how Jupiter's doing.

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.490
Fair point, Me From the Past; Jupiter by the
way, still giant and gassy.

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.600
There's two reasons why we focus a little
more on humanity in Big History; the selfish

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.010
reason is that we care about humans in Big
History because we are humans. We are naturally

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:20.130
curious to figure out where we belong in the huge
sequence of events beginning with the big bang.

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.800
Secondly, humans represent a really weird
change in the universe. I mean, so far as we

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.780
know, we are one of the most complex things
in the cosmos.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.830
Whether you measure complexity in terms of
biological and cultural building blocks or

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:39.240
networks or connections, I mean, we're kind
of amazing! Now I realize that many of our

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.850
viewers will be offended by our human-centric
bias, but humans are amazing. I mean, we invented

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:51.189
the internet and we invented animated GIF
and we invented Dr. Who and then we invented

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:53.900
Tumblr, a place where all of these things
can come together!

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.890
So 65 million years ago, catastrophe wiped
out the dinosaurs and we saw the adaptive

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.229
radiation of a tiny shrew-like ancestor of
humans that would look more at home like,

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.480
next to a hamster wheel than in your family
album. Let's set the stage in the Thought Bubble.

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:14.280
So the slow waltz of plate tectonics continued
to pull Eurasia and the Americas apart expanding

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:20.120
the Atlantic Ocean, primates colonized the Americas,
and separated by the vast Atlantic, continued

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.360
their separate evolution into the new world monkeys --
which is not a band name, although it should be.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:31.000
Then around 45 million years ago, Australia
split from Antarctica and while mammals out-competed

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.290
most marsupials in the Americas (except animals
like possums), Australia saw an adaptive radiation

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.129
of marsupials. This, of course, meant that
later, one-hundred thousand years ago when

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:44.900
the Americas were having their share of mammoths
and saber-tooth tigers, Australia was having

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:50.690
a spell of gigantic kangaroos, marsupial lions,
and wombats the size of hippos.

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.349
Then, somewhere around forty million years
ago, India, which had been floating around

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:58.810
the southern oceans as an island, smashed
into the Eurasian continent with such force

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.190
that it created the world's tallest mountain
range, the Himalayas.

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.959
Meanwhile, in Africa, Primates continued to
evolve and twenty-five to thirty million years

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:13.159
ago, the line of the apes diverged from theold-world
monkeys and no, neither you, nor a chimp,

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:18.000
is a monkey, nor did we evolve from the monkeys that
are around today - those are like our cousins.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.020
Moreover, we did not evolve from chimpanzees,
the chimpanzee is a cousin as well, not an

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:29.720
uncle. We are not more highly evolved than
they are; Instead, our lines of descent split

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:34.560
off from a common ancestor with chimpanzees
about seven million years ago. Then chimpanzees

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:39.019
further split into a separate species, the
Bonobos. Knowing about this common ancestry

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:42.690
tells us a lot about our shared traits with
other primates.

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.709
For instance, we all have fairly large brains,
relative to our body mass, we have our eyes

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:50.650
in the front of our heads from the days when
we hung out in trees and depth perception

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.569
was an excellent way of telling how far away
the next tree branch was so as to prevent

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:58.120
us from plummeting to our deaths, and we also
have grasping hands, to make sure, you know,

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.879
that you could hold onto the branch in question.
Primates also have hierarchies, social orders

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:09.699
whether male or female led, that determine who gets
primary access to food, mates, and other benefits.

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.680
Thanks Thought Bubble! So, our closest evolutionary
cousins, the chimpanzees, can tell us a thing

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.229
or two about shared behaviors. For one thing,
while all primates have a hierarchy of alphas

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:24.099
and betas, humans and chimps, who share 98.4%
of their DNA, are the most prone to team up

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:29.020
together and launch a revolution against the
alpha male. We're also both prone to ganging

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:33.180
up, roaming our territory, and beating up
unsuspecting foreigners of the same species,

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.560
and not for direct survival reasons.

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.860
Chimpanzees have been observed finding a lone
chimp male from another group and kicking,

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:44.389
hitting, and tearing off bits of his body
and then leaving the helpless victim to die

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:49.550
of his wounds, and humans definitely bear
this stamp of our lowly origin, where indeed,

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:54.449
the imperfect step-by-step process of evolution
made us highly intelligent, but still, with

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:57.869
prefrontal cortex's too small, and adrenal
glands maybe too big.

00:04:57.869 --> 00:05:01.980
Aggression and blood lust are definitely part
of our shared heritage, and, looking at more

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.479
recent human history, does that really surprise
anyone? Contrast that behavior, for a moment,

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:09.830
with the more peaceful Bonobos, who are female-led,
and when a male in her group gets a bit pushy,

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:13.300
the females are prone to gang up and teach
him a lesson. When it comes to inter-group

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:18.499
encounters in the wild, the male Bonobos seem
tense around strangers at first, until usually,

00:05:18.499 --> 00:05:22.659
the females from each group cross over and just
have sex with the newcomers, completely diffusing

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:26.619
the tension. Talk about make love, not war
- Bonobos are hippies.

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:30.560
While our common ancestor with chimpanzees
around seven million years ago was more suited

00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:35.080
to living in forests and seeking refuge from
danger by climbing trees, climate change in

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:39.460
East Africa made things colder and drier,
and many forests were replaced by woodlands

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:43.509
and wide-open savanna. Life in the savanna
meant our ancestors needed to run from predators

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:47.469
rather than climbing trees, so our line shifted
away from the bow-legged stance reminiscent

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:51.689
of chimpanzees, and developed bipedalism,
where our locomotion came from legs that were

00:05:51.689 --> 00:05:53.500
straight and forward-facing.

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.599
There's still some debate about when bipedalism
first began, but we know that by the first

00:05:56.599 --> 00:06:01.240
australopithecines around four million years
ago, our evolutionary line was bipedal, this

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:02.880
also freed up our hands.

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:07.340
Australopithecines were not very tall, standing
only just above a meter, or just above 3.5

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:11.259
feet, and had brains only a little bigger
than modern chimpanzees. They were largely

00:06:11.259 --> 00:06:15.479
herbivores with teeth adapted for grinding
tough fruits and leaves. Australopithecines

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:19.229
may have communicated through gestures and
primitive sounds, but their higher larynx

00:06:19.229 --> 00:06:22.770
meant that they couldn't make the range of
sounds required for complex language. There

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:27.270
was probably a lot of pointing and grunting
going on. Kinda like me, before 6 am.

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:31.330
By 2.3 million years ago, homo habilis arrived
on the scene. They weren't much taller than

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:35.460
australopithecines, but they had significantly
larger brains - though still a lot smaller

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:40.139
than later species. Excitingly, homo habilis
is known to have hit flakes off of stones

00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:45.219
to use them for cutting. Now, lots of species
use tools, for instance chimpanzees use sticks

00:06:45.219 --> 00:06:49.479
for fishing termites out of the ground, they
use rock hammers and leaf sponges and branch

00:06:49.479 --> 00:06:53.819
levers and banana leaf umbrellas. A lot of
these skills don't seem to arise spontaneously,

00:06:53.819 --> 00:06:57.839
just because of the intelligence of individuals,
but, like in the case of termite fishing,

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:02.100
chimpanzees pass the information on by imitation
- primate see, primate do.

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:06.240
In a way, this social learning is sort of
cultural, yet, succeeding generations of chimpanzees

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:10.240
don't accumulate information, tinker with
it, and improve upon it, so that after 100

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:14.680
years, chimpanzees are owners of highly efficient
and wealthy termite fishing corporations.

00:07:14.689 --> 00:07:19.719
Similarly, as impressive as homo habilis stone-working
abilities are, we see very little sign of

00:07:19.719 --> 00:07:24.379
technological improvement over the thousands
and thousands of years that habilis existed.

00:07:24.379 --> 00:07:28.189
Same goes for homo ergaster erectus, who was
around 1.9 million years ago.

00:07:28.189 --> 00:07:33.529
Homo ergaster erectus had an even bigger brain,
was taller, and they even seemed intelligent

00:07:33.529 --> 00:07:37.209
and adaptable enough to move into different
environments across the old world. They may

00:07:37.209 --> 00:07:41.549
have even begun our first clumsy attempts
at fire, which is vital for cooking meat and

00:07:41.549 --> 00:07:45.160
vegetables, opening up opportunities for more
energy and even more brain growth.

00:07:45.169 --> 00:07:49.499
But still, there's not much sign of technological
improvement, their tools got the job done,

00:07:49.499 --> 00:07:50.959
if it ain't broke, don't fix it.

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:55.999
Yet 1.78 million years ago, we do see homo
ergaster creating a wide new range of teardrop

00:07:55.999 --> 00:08:00.050
hand axes in Kenya. By one-point-five 1.5
million years ago, these teardrop axes had

00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:04.839
rapidly become common, and had improved in
quality and were shaped with a flat edge into

00:08:04.839 --> 00:08:07.559
multi-purpose picks, cleavers, and so forth.

00:08:07.559 --> 00:08:11.860
Archaeologists see this as the first possible
sign of tinkering and improvement of technology

00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:17.680
that may have been transmitted by social learning. A
faint glimmer of something new. Why is this important?

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:20.880
Well, humans didn't get to where we are
because we're super-geniuses. It's

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:24.560
not like invented the Xbox One out of the
blue one day, it was an improvement upon the

00:08:24.569 --> 00:08:29.749
Xbox 360 which was an improvement upon earlier
consoles, arcade machines, computers, and

00:08:29.749 --> 00:08:33.110
backward onto the dawn of video games.
In the same way, we didn't just invent our

00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:39.000
modern society by sudden inspiration, it's
the result of 250,000 years of tinkering and

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.800
improvement. This is where accumulation matters
- it's called collective learning, the ability

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:48.629
of a species to retain more information with
one generation than is lost by the next. This

00:08:48.629 --> 00:08:53.329
is what has taken us, in a few thousand years,
from stone tools to rocket engines to being

00:08:53.329 --> 00:08:56.980
able to have the Crash Course theme song as
your ringtone. Progress!

00:08:56.980 --> 00:09:01.399
If there was collective learning in homo ergaster,
it was very slow and very slight. This may

00:09:01.399 --> 00:09:05.980
have been due to limitations on communication,
abstract thought, group size, or just plain

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:10.649
brain power. But over the next two million
years, things started to pick up. Homo antecessor,

00:09:10.649 --> 00:09:14.610
Homo Heidelbergensis and the Neanderthals
developed the first systematically controlled

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:19.610
use of fire in hearths, the first blade tools,
the earliest wooden spears, the earliest use

00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:25.160
of composite tools, where stone was fastened
to wood, all before homo sapiens were ever

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:27.480
heard of, around 250,000 years ago.

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:31.839
Neanderthals even moved into colder climates,
where they were compelled to invent clothing,

00:09:31.839 --> 00:09:36.360
they used complex tool-manufacture to produce
sharp points and scrapers and hand-axes and

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:39.760
wood handles, and they improved their craft
over time.

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:44.220
While evolution by natural selection is a
sort of learning mechanism that allows a species

00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:49.310
to adapt generation after generation, with
a lot of trial and error, and death - collective

00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:54.310
learning allows for tinkering, adaptation,
and improvement on a much faster scale with

00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:59.170
each generation and across generations without
waiting for your genes to catch up.

00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:03.509
Anatomically similar homo sapiens have been
around for about 250,000 years, and throughout

00:10:03.509 --> 00:10:08.319
that time, we've been expanding our toolkit
from stone tools to shell fishing to trade

00:10:08.319 --> 00:10:13.930
and actual fishing, mining, and by 40,000
years ago we had art, including cave images,

00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:18.160
decorative beads and other forms of jewelry,
and even the world's oldest known musical

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:21.480
instruments - flutes carved from mammoth ivory
and bird bones.

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:26.399
All this stuff came about as a result of collective
learning. As long as you have a population

00:10:26.399 --> 00:10:30.740
of potential innovators, who can keep dreaming
up new ideas and remembering old ones and an

00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:35.180
opportunity for those old innovators to pass
their ideas onto others, you're likely to

00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:37.060
have some technological progress.

00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:42.360
These mechanisms are still working today - we've
got over seven billion potential innovators on

00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:47.959
this planet, and almost instantaneous communication,
allowing us to do so many marvelous things

00:10:47.959 --> 00:10:50.990
including teach you about Big History on the
internet.

00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:55.180
So life for early humans was pretty good,
like foraging didn't require particularly

00:10:55.180 --> 00:11:00.269
long hours - the average work day for a forager
was about 6.5 hours. When you compare that

00:11:00.269 --> 00:11:04.779
to an average of 9.5 hours for a peasant farmer
in medieval Europe, or the average of nine

00:11:04.779 --> 00:11:09.699
hours for a typical office worker today, foraging
seems downright leisurely.

00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:14.680
Quick aside: I work thirty minutes a day less
than a peasant farmer in medieval Europe?

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:17.339
That's not progress! Stan, I want more time
off!

00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:20.360
Stan just pointed out that I have a chair,
something that peasant farmers in medieval

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:23.580
Europe did not enjoy, and I want to say that
I'm very grateful for my chair.

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:24.620
Thank you for my chair, Stan.

00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:29.980
Anyway, a forager would go out, hunt or gather,
come home, eat, spend time with the family,

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:34.959
dance, sing, tell stories, and foragers were
also always on the move, which made it less

00:11:34.959 --> 00:11:39.799
likely that they'd contaminate their water,
or sit around waiting for a plague to develop.

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:44.139
And with their constant walking and their
varied diet, foragers were in many ways healthier

00:11:44.139 --> 00:11:47.759
than the peasants of ancient civilizations.
There were also, in some ways, healthier than

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:52.079
us, but we have antibiotics for now, so we
live longer, for now.

00:11:52.079 --> 00:11:56.240
The classic view of foraging life is best
described by Thomas Hobbes, who wrote:

00:11:56.240 --> 00:12:02.040
"No arts, no letters, no society, and which
is worst of all continual fear and danger

00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:09.300
of violent death and the life of man, solitary,
poor, nasty, brutish, and short."

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:13.540
Except, not really. I mean, life for the average
person in twelfth century France was also

00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:18.060
a smidge nasty, brutish, and short, and the
lack of wealth disparity in foraging cultures

00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:22.670
may imply greater equality between social
rankings and even between the genders since

00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:26.749
female gatherers appear to be responsible
for the majority of food collected, rather

00:12:26.749 --> 00:12:32.389
than the hunting males. And from that perspective,
life was kind of ruined by the advent of agriculture

00:12:32.389 --> 00:12:35.400
and then, later, with states, as Jean-Jacques
Rousseau said,

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:40.279
"The first person, who having enclosed a plot
of land, took it into his head to say, 'this

00:12:40.279 --> 00:12:45.339
is mine' and found people simple enough to
believe him, was the true founder of civil

00:12:45.339 --> 00:12:50.800
society. What crimes, wars, murders, what
miseries and horrors would the human race

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:55.569
have spared, had someone pulled up the stakes
or filled in the ditch and cried out to his

00:12:55.569 --> 00:13:00.829
fellow men: 'do not listen to this imposter,
you are lost if you forget that the fruits of the

00:13:00.829 --> 00:13:03.810
Earth belong to all, and the Earth to no one'"

00:13:03.810 --> 00:13:06.990
and thus summarizes one of the great debates
in the world of political science. Man, Big

00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:11.569
History discusses everything! Now, it's possible
that neither Rousseau nor Hobbes was completely

00:13:11.569 --> 00:13:17.050
correct, and that, like, private property and agriculture
didn't create the glory days or end them.

00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:22.149
Like, as previous mentioned, all primates
have a dominance hierarchy of some kind. Also,

00:13:22.149 --> 00:13:26.069
you don't need a wealth disparity to drive
human beings to hurt each other - like, surveys

00:13:26.069 --> 00:13:30.420
of excavated remains from the paleolithic
indicate a murder rate that was possibly as

00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:34.490
high as ten percent. Now, those statistics
are still disputed, but despite the relatively

00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:38.569
short work day, life in the paleolithic sounds
a lot less appealing when you consider the

00:13:38.569 --> 00:13:42.350
high murder rate, and also, the occasional
infanticide. That's not even to mention the

00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:46.009
old or disabled people who, when they couldn't
keep up anymore, were abandoned to die in

00:13:46.009 --> 00:13:49.509
the wild. I can't help but feel that I might
not have thrived in the paleolithic what with

00:13:49.509 --> 00:13:53.170
my visual impairment and general lack of interest
in hunting.

00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:57.829
Anyway, we call this the Hobbes vs. Rousseau
debate, and it's still unresolved. I mean,

00:13:57.829 --> 00:14:02.689
humans may have been corrupted in many ways
by society, on the other hand, it's possible

00:14:02.689 --> 00:14:07.939
a lot of the crimes and follies of human history
may just be symptoms of our coping with the

00:14:07.939 --> 00:14:10.490
bad wiring left to us by evolution.

00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:14.449
You know, humans are a bit of an obsolete
machine, we aren't particularly well-suited

00:14:14.449 --> 00:14:18.240
to the many lifestyle changes that have happened
in the past few thousand years - faster than

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:22.329
our genes can keep pace with. But how you
interpret the lives of early human foragers

00:14:22.329 --> 00:14:27.970
largely determines your view of history and
also the fundamental nature of the human character.

00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:34.100
Ask yourself which side you sit on: Is humanity
fundamentally good and corrupted by technology

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:38.970
and modern social orders, or are we fundamentally
flawed and in need of some sort of structure

00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:43.640
and authority? Or is there some kind of both/and way
of addressing the question? Here at Crash Course,

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:48.080
we don't have answers, but we are grateful that
you're pondering these questions with us.

00:14:48.089 --> 00:14:53.559
In any case, collective learning was really
good for our survival, but then, 74,000 years

00:14:53.559 --> 00:14:58.970
ago, disaster struck. A super-eruption at
Mt. Toba on the island of Sumatra in present-day

00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:04.820
Indonesia clouded the skies with ash and cooled
the climate. Plants and animals, a.k.a. food, died

00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:09.860
off and genetics studies showed that this
reduced the human population to a few thousand

00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:14.420
people. So as a result of this, we aren't
exactly inbred, but there's more genetic diversity

00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:19.410
between two of the major groups of chimpanzees
in Africa than there is in all of humanity.

00:15:19.410 --> 00:15:25.009
So this small group heroically recovered and
spread out of Africa 64,000 years ago, colonizing

00:15:25.009 --> 00:15:30.689
diverse environments and continuing to innovate.
For 13.8 billion years since the beginning

00:15:30.689 --> 00:15:34.660
of the universe, complexity had been rising
in a powerful crescendo, but in the space

00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:39.900
of a few millennia, collective learning was
about to make things really bonkers.

00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:41.120
More on that next time.
