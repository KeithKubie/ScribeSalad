00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
[Narrator] And it turns out it's actually harder than you think,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
but I'm going to show you how to do it,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and once you've done it, you can use the exact same code

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
forever for any particle filter.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
But let me emphasize what resampling actually means.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
We are given N particles, each of which has 3 values,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and there's N of them, and they also now have weights.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
These are simple floats or continuous values.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Let's call big W the sum of all these weights,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and let's normalize them just for the consideration of what to do,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and it's called the normalized weights alpha.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
So alpha 1 would be the weight 1 divided by the normalizer W,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and so on all the way to alpha N,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and obviously it goes without saying that the sum of all alphas is now 1,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
since we normalized them.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
What resampling now does is it puts all these particles

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
and then normalized weights into a big bag,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
and then it draws with replacement N

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
new particles by picking each particle with probability alpha.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
So, for example, alpha 2 might be large

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
so we're going to pick this one, P2.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Alpha 3 might also be large so we pick that one.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Alpha 4 might be really small but just by chance you might actually pick it.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
So, we have P4 over here, and then we might pick alpha 2, again.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
So, you get 2 versions of P2, perhaps even 3 versions of P2,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
depending on the probabilities.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
We have N particles over here.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
We do this thing N times, which is why I said with replacement

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
we can draw multiple copies of the same particle,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
and in the end those particles that have a high-normalized weight alpha over here

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
will occur likely more frequently in the new set over here.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
That's called resampling.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
So, to make sure you understand this

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
let me ask you a couple of quizzes.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Suppose we have 5 particles with the following importance weights:

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:16.000
0.6, 1.2, 2.4, 0.6, and 1.2.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
If I, in the process of resampling,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
randomly draw a particle in accordance to the normalized importance weights.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
What is the probability of drawing P1,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
P2,

00:02:29.000 --> 09:59:59.000
P4 and P5?
