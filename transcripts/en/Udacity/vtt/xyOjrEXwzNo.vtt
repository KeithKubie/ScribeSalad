00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.130
Earlier we discussed how the product
of two integers with the same sign will

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:05.730
always be positive.

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.230
Well, it turns out the same is true for
quotients.

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.190
A negative integer divided
by another negative integer

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:15.910
will yield a positive quotient.

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.390
And a positive integer divided
by a positive integer will

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.110
also yield a positive quotient.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:26.380
With this in mind, do you think that
quotients are products of two integers

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:32.000
with different signs will be positive or
negative, or does it depend?

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:32.670
Please pick one.
