00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:01.700
What I want to do in this video

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:04.473
is to talk a little bit about 401(k)'s

00:00:04.473 --> 00:00:07.205
which you probably at
minimum have heard of.

00:00:07.205 --> 00:00:10.139
Just from the get-go,
just to put some structure

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.139
in your mind of what this really is

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:15.136
is it's very similar to a traditional IRA.

00:00:15.136 --> 00:00:27.472
It's very similar to a traditional IRA

00:00:27.472 --> 00:00:29.339
and the ways that they're the same

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:31.203
is that you defer you taxes.

00:00:31.203 --> 00:00:38.119
You put money in on a tax deferred basis.

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.873
Let me put it this way,

00:00:38.873 --> 00:00:47.945
you put pretax money in.

00:00:47.945 --> 00:00:52.534
The money can grow inside
of either the 401(k) account

00:00:52.534 --> 00:00:57.040
or the traditional IRA account untaxed.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.929
Let me write that,

00:00:57.929 --> 00:01:09.055
money grows in account untaxed

00:01:09.055 --> 00:01:11.054
and then you can withdraw it,

00:01:11.054 --> 00:01:13.553
you can withdraw the money.

00:01:13.553 --> 00:01:19.470
You can withdraw or start
getting distributions

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:26.884
from the account after age 59-1/2.

00:01:26.884 --> 00:01:28.721
That's essentially when you're
going to start retiring,

00:01:28.721 --> 00:01:30.390
when you're going to need the money.

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.057
When you withdraw after the age of 59-1/2

00:01:34.057 --> 00:01:43.880
you will then pay income tax.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.121
This is what people are talking about

00:01:45.121 --> 00:01:47.348
when they talk about deferring taxes.

00:01:47.348 --> 00:01:48.988
You're not getting out of the taxes,

00:01:48.988 --> 00:01:50.521
you're just pushing off the date

00:01:50.521 --> 00:01:52.606
that you're going to
have to pay the taxes.

00:01:52.606 --> 00:01:54.607
For a lot of people this might be useful

00:01:54.607 --> 00:01:56.454
because while you are making money,

00:01:56.454 --> 00:01:58.937
you might be paying at a fairly high

00:01:58.937 --> 00:02:00.395
incremental tax rate

00:02:00.395 --> 00:02:01.688
but then once you're retired

00:02:01.688 --> 00:02:02.787
you have a much lower,

00:02:02.787 --> 00:02:03.857
you'll have a much lower,

00:02:03.857 --> 00:02:08.264
I guess you'll be in a much
lower incremental tax bracket

00:02:08.264 --> 00:02:12.124
and so your total overall
tax bill might be lower.

00:02:12.124 --> 00:02:13.354
Also, maybe something happens

00:02:13.354 --> 00:02:15.791
just in terms of what the government does,

00:02:15.791 --> 00:02:17.520
in terms of how they charge taxes.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.787
In general, if you had to pay 50 cents

00:02:19.787 --> 00:02:22.191
20 years in the future
versus 50 cents today,

00:02:22.191 --> 00:02:24.187
just present value of money tells you

00:02:24.187 --> 00:02:28.523
that that 50 cents is going
to be worth a lot less

00:02:28.523 --> 00:02:29.353
in the future

00:02:29.353 --> 00:02:32.190
or the present value of it is a lot less.

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.721
That's some reasons to defer.

00:02:33.721 --> 00:02:36.269
Of course, you're not just going to pay

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:37.728
on what you put in,

00:02:37.728 --> 00:02:40.519
you will then also pay income
tax on what you've put in

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:42.858
and whatever grew.

00:02:42.858 --> 00:02:52.193
You'll pay income tax on total disbursals.

00:02:52.193 --> 00:02:53.269
In both cases,

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:54.852
you have to start taking disbursements

00:02:54.852 --> 00:02:57.263
from your account by 70-1/2.

00:02:57.263 --> 00:03:02.800
Penalties, let me write it this way.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:11.273
Penalties, if you don't withdraw

00:03:11.273 --> 00:03:15.990
or you don't start withdrawing
some of your funds by 70-1/2.

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:17.654
There's some special
cases if you're working

00:03:17.654 --> 00:03:19.286
and all these type of things.

00:03:19.286 --> 00:03:23.522
Now, what's happens if you
withdraw before age 59-1/2?

00:03:23.522 --> 00:03:28.252
Before 59-1/2.

00:03:28.252 --> 00:03:30.388
So far, everything I've listed is true

00:03:30.388 --> 00:03:33.789
of both 401(k)'s and traditional IRAs.

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:45.992
If you withdraw before 59-1/2,
you are taxed on withdrawal.

00:03:45.992 --> 00:03:49.927
On top of that, there's a 10% penalty

00:03:49.927 --> 00:03:56.209
on all the funds you receive. 10% penalty.

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:57.391
This is what you have to think about

00:03:57.391 --> 00:03:58.624
unless if you just say,

00:03:58.624 --> 00:03:59.725
"Oh, I'm always just going to max out

00:03:59.725 --> 00:04:01.657
"my traditional IRA or 401(k)."

00:04:01.657 --> 00:04:02.721
You got to make sure

00:04:02.721 --> 00:04:05.057
they're not going to want
that money before 59-1/2

00:04:05.057 --> 00:04:08.324
because you might be
facing this 10% withdrawal.

00:04:08.324 --> 00:04:10.327
These are all the cases that are the same.

00:04:10.327 --> 00:04:11.786
The question is why do they both exist?

00:04:11.786 --> 00:04:13.853
Why is there something
called a traditional IRA

00:04:13.853 --> 00:04:15.876
and why is there
something called a 401(k)?

00:04:15.876 --> 00:04:17.391
They both seem like a pretty good way

00:04:17.391 --> 00:04:18.721
for me to defer taxes,

00:04:18.721 --> 00:04:24.459
get earnings on my investment

00:04:24.459 --> 00:04:25.456
in a taxed deferred way

00:04:25.456 --> 00:04:26.989
and then pay it some future date

00:04:26.989 --> 00:04:29.527
and they both force me to make sure

00:04:29.527 --> 00:04:32.264
or they strongly suggest

00:04:32.264 --> 00:04:35.269
that I shouldn't take out
my money before 59-1/2.

00:04:35.269 --> 00:04:36.733
The ways that they're different,

00:04:36.733 --> 00:04:39.046
let's focus on the differences,

00:04:39.046 --> 00:04:47.278
the differences between the 2.

00:04:47.278 --> 00:04:58.930
One is 401(k)'s have a higher limit

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.660
and if you're focused on 2010,

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.527
but these numbers keep changing.

00:05:03.527 --> 00:05:09.329
In 2010 the 401(k) limit is $16,500

00:05:09.329 --> 00:05:11.155
and that's for just what you contribute

00:05:11.155 --> 00:05:15.226
into your 401(k).

00:05:15.226 --> 00:05:18.535
This is for a 401(k).

00:05:18.535 --> 00:05:24.475
While the IRA limit is $5,000.

00:05:24.475 --> 00:05:25.270
This is an IRA.

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:27.743
One; 401(k), you can just
participate with more money.

00:05:27.743 --> 00:05:28.869
Actually, in both of these cases,

00:05:28.869 --> 00:05:31.203
as you approach your retirement,

00:05:31.203 --> 00:05:32.612
after the age of 50.

00:05:32.612 --> 00:05:34.205
Let me put that in the same thing

00:05:34.205 --> 00:05:35.607
just so we're comprehensive.

00:05:35.607 --> 00:05:36.809
Another similarity is that

00:05:36.809 --> 00:05:45.032
you can accelerate or have higher,

00:05:45.032 --> 00:05:47.739
you could have higher, I guess,

00:05:47.739 --> 00:05:49.741
deposits into your account,

00:05:49.741 --> 00:05:53.136
accelerate after 50.

00:05:53.136 --> 00:05:54.475
Which just means you can put more money

00:05:54.475 --> 00:05:56.802
than these limits that I have right here.

00:05:56.802 --> 00:05:58.537
These are limits before you're 50,

00:05:58.537 --> 00:06:01.333
after 50, between 50 and 59-1/2

00:06:01.333 --> 00:06:02.356
when you can start withdrawing.

00:06:02.356 --> 00:06:03.869
You can put a little
bit more money in that

00:06:03.869 --> 00:06:05.807
and these are constantly moving targets.

00:06:05.807 --> 00:06:08.275
The general idea is that
you can put more money

00:06:08.275 --> 00:06:11.694
inside of a 401(k).

00:06:11.694 --> 00:06:14.361
Now, the other difference is that a 401(k)

00:06:14.361 --> 00:06:17.612
tends to be organized by your employer.

00:06:17.612 --> 00:06:25.782
401(k) organized by employer.

00:06:25.782 --> 00:06:28.532
Just, from your point of
view, that means 2 things,

00:06:28.532 --> 00:06:31.407
One is the employer will often specify

00:06:31.407 --> 00:06:33.538
the potential investments.

00:06:33.538 --> 00:06:40.385
Specifies investments.

00:06:40.385 --> 00:06:44.513
They'll actually run the
401(k) account for you.

00:06:44.513 --> 00:06:46.270
Normally it will be held by someone else

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:49.427
but it will be for your
company, for company x.

00:06:49.427 --> 00:06:52.424
The company gets to decide
the universe of investments

00:06:52.424 --> 00:06:55.421
that you might be able to invest in.

00:06:55.421 --> 00:06:57.402
The other thing, because
it's run by the employer,

00:06:57.402 --> 00:07:06.539
the employer might match.

00:07:06.539 --> 00:07:08.469
Which means for every dollar you put in,

00:07:08.469 --> 00:07:09.296
they'll put another dollar

00:07:09.296 --> 00:07:10.868
even they might go above matching

00:07:10.868 --> 00:07:12.547
and you could actually go up to,

00:07:12.547 --> 00:07:15.383
I think the current limits
are approaching $50,000

00:07:15.383 --> 00:07:20.216
for the total of the
employee and employer match.

00:07:20.216 --> 00:07:21.586
You can actually get a lot of,

00:07:21.586 --> 00:07:22.516
I guess you could think of it,

00:07:22.516 --> 00:07:24.528
leverage from putting in into a 401(k)

00:07:24.528 --> 00:07:26.528
if you have a very generous employer.

00:07:26.528 --> 00:07:27.843
The other difference,

00:07:27.843 --> 00:07:29.735
this is really a superficial difference

00:07:29.735 --> 00:07:31.723
because it's just what you see,

00:07:31.723 --> 00:07:34.257
is that with the 401(k)
the money will be taken out

00:07:34.257 --> 00:07:36.349
of your paycheck, you will never see it.

00:07:36.349 --> 00:07:44.182
Taken out before paycheck.

00:07:44.182 --> 00:07:47.040
While with a traditional IRA,

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:48.446
you will take the money,

00:07:48.446 --> 00:07:50.188
invest it into a traditional IRA account

00:07:50.188 --> 00:07:51.650
and when you report your taxes

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:54.193
it will be reported as a tax deduction

00:07:54.193 --> 00:07:55.718
and so you won't have to pay tax on it.

00:07:55.718 --> 00:07:58.383
Functionally they're the exact same thing.

00:07:58.383 --> 00:08:00.112
When you think about the pros and cons,

00:08:00.112 --> 00:08:03.862
if you have a 401(k), if the
option is available to you,

00:08:03.862 --> 00:08:05.272
it's a pretty good option.

00:08:05.272 --> 00:08:07.246
You're going to have higher limit.

00:08:07.246 --> 00:08:09.530
You're going to have a
higher limit right over here

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:13.996
and your employer might match it.

00:08:13.996 --> 00:08:14.917
Then the other thing,

00:08:14.917 --> 00:08:16.331
and this doesn't come into plays a lot,

00:08:16.331 --> 00:08:18.575
but there's also the option of borrowing

00:08:18.575 --> 00:08:21.246
from a 401(k) without penalty.

00:08:21.246 --> 00:08:26.783
Borrowing from a 401(k)

00:08:26.783 --> 00:08:30.162
but you have to pay back
interest to the 401(k) account

00:08:30.162 --> 00:08:31.850
if you did that and you cannot do that

00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:34.119
with a traditional IRA.

00:08:34.119 --> 00:08:35.327
Now, when you're looking
at all these you're like,

00:08:35.327 --> 00:08:35.657
"Whoa!

00:08:35.657 --> 00:08:37.585
"Why would anyone ever want
to do a traditional IRA?"

00:08:37.585 --> 00:08:38.331
There's a couple of things.

00:08:38.331 --> 00:08:39.268
One; you could do both.

00:08:39.268 --> 00:08:42.247
Or the other thing is
with traditional IRAs

00:08:42.247 --> 00:08:44.410
you have much more flexibility

00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:46.077
on where you want to invest.

00:08:46.077 --> 00:08:48.744
Maybe your company says
you can only invest in us,

00:08:48.744 --> 00:08:50.495
you can only invest in
that company's stock.

00:08:50.495 --> 00:08:55.264
In traditional IRAs you
can invest in anything.

00:08:55.264 --> 00:08:59.264
Hopefully that clarifies
things a bit for you.
