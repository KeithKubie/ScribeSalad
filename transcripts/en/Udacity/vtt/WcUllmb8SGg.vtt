00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:02.610
So for 1000 people with two alleles each, we

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.700
have a total of 2000 alleles in our population.

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.650
Now if we measure the allele frequency as the

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:12.340
number of the specific allele we are interested in,

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.800
divided by the total number of alleles in our

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.480
population. Then what are the frequencies of each of

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.690
the lactase persistent and non-persistent alleles, the plus and

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:25.810
the minus? I want you to calculate their frequencies and

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.710
put them in each box, respectively. A

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.170
fraction or decimal response will work just fine.
