00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.260
You were once the size of the head of a pin.
Let’s just start out with that.

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:06.460
Two millimeters. At the most.

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.679
And today -- I don’t know you, but I’m
assuming that you’re a lot larger than that.

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.259
Many, many pin-heads from head to toe.

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.750
Assuming the average human is about 1.7 meters,
it’s safe to say that you’re about 850

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.980
times taller than when you started out, as
a zygote.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.630
I think we all deserve a round of applause.
I’m very proud of us. But how did it happen?

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.320
How does a single cell eventually grow into
the fully-formed, several-trillion-celled

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.119
body we’ve spent all year discussing?

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:37.690
And for that matter, how the heck does a female
body nurture, protect, and generally tolerate

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.579
growing a whole new person inside of it -- with
all the mood swings, sore and swollen parts,

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:46.460
increased blood volume, constant pee breaks,
and general body weirdness?

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.900
On an emotional level, I have no idea how the mothers
-- or the zygotes, for that matter -- endure all of that.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.400
But on a physiological level, like so many
aspects of our body’s functions,

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.020
pregnancy begins and ends with the same thing:
Hormones.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:15.560
Last week we left off with a sperm and an egg, against
all odds, finally getting together to make a zygote.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.480
Now, how that tiny head of a pin gets to be
even a fraction of the size you are now -- a

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.810
newborn human that’s, say, 50 centimeters
long, is complex.

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.770
It involves a system of hormonal signals that
-- as sophisticated as they are -- get interpreted

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.310
by the very earliest human cells into three
simple instructions:

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.740
Divide. Differentiate. Develop.

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.650
The first step, dividing, begins in what’s
known as the cleavage phase, when cells cleave,

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:40.420
or split in two, over and over.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.920
It starts about 24 hours after fertilization,
when a little zygote turns from 1 cell into

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.200
16 cells -- called blastomeres.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.500
The cells divide so quickly that they don’t
actually grow between divisions -- they just

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.439
create more smaller cells.

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.700
This allows each little cell to have more
surface area, which helps them take in the

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.979
oxygen and nutrients they need from their
environment.

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:02.159
And, of course, it also creates more raw
materials for building an even larger zygote,

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.060
and, eventually, an embryonic human.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.540
Like, you don’t make a car by carving it
from a single chunk of metal. You put together

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.480
lots of smaller components, each with its
own form and function. That’s what these

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:12.830
cells are during cleavage.

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.209
About three days after fertilization, these
divisions have formed a little berry-shaped

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:20.069
cluster of cells that looks different and
complex enough to get a whole new name -- a

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:21.790
morula, from the Latin for “mulberry.”

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.750
It’s one of the cuter terms you’ll come
across in human physiology, and it also marks

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.730
the end of the cleavage stage.

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.879
Because: The little cells that make up the
morula don’t stay together as a solid mass

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:35.220
-- instead, they start to form a hollow sphere
filled with fluid -- a blastocyst.

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.739
A blastocyst contains a single outer layer
of large, flat trophoblast cells, and inside

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:44.269
a cluster of smaller cells forms, called the
inner cell mass.

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:47.950
This mass is what’s going to turn into the
embryo, eventually, while the trophoblasts

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.260
will go on to form the placenta and blood
vessels that will nourish it.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.540
But, keep in mind: During all of these early
divisions, the zygote, and then the morula,

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.090
are on the move -- they’re headed down the
fallopian tube toward the uterus.

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.030
So, in addition to manufacturing a ton of
tiny pieces and assembling them into something

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.510
that’s getting increasingly complex, the
whole operation is mobile. It’s kind of

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.090
like you’re building a car while you’re
driving it.

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.610
When the blastocyst reaches the uterus, it
just floats around for a few days, soaking

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.720
up secretions that are full of vitamins and
glycoproteins, looking for a place to call home.

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.640
But soon, it’s gonna need permanent nutritional
support. So, about a week after ovulation,

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.959
it snuggles up to the endometrial layer and
starts the process of implantation.

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:27.250
Now, up to this point, we’ve just been talking
about the zygote itself, and the changes it’s

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.069
been undergoing. And we’re all very proud
of it.

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:33.090
But from here on, the changes are best understood
not just in terms of the budding, soon-to-be

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.980
embryo, but in terms of the whole environment
where its changes are taking place.

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.739
That environment being: the mother’s body.

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:42.680
Implantation is only possible, after all,
thanks to surges of estrogen and progesterone

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.200
from the corpus luteum -- the ruptured follicle
that we talked about last time.

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.260
And together, they prepare the endometrium
to receive the blastocyst, allowing the uterine

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.100
lining to bind to little proteins on the trophoblasts,
holding onto them for the duration of the pregnancy.

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:59.040
If all goes according to plan, implantation
takes about five days and finishes up around

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:02.790
twelve days after ovulation, right around
when menstruation would otherwise kick in

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.090
and slough off the endometrium.

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:08.409
If that happened it would be bad, so the trophoblasts
secrete a luteinizing-like hormone called

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:11.080
human chorionic gonadotropin, or hCG.

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:16.479
This hormone bypasses the whole hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian
axis -- if you remember that -- and talks

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:20.459
directly to the corpus luteum, telling it
to keep pumping out estrogen and progesterone.

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.889
So, the first thing to notice here is that,
from this point on, most of what happens to

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:26.949
this little clump of cells is happening because:
Hormones.

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:31.550
hCG is basically calling all the shots, triggering
the release of other hormones that are crucial

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:32.940
to the blastocyst’s development.

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.440
But while hormones are doing the grunt work,
you might also notice that the blastocyst

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:41.540
is really in charge now. Essentially, it has
taken over hormonal control of the whole uterus.

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.389
The release of hormones is that powerful.

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:47.880
In fact, a whole new -- albeit temporary -- organ
is forming at this point, too, which is going

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.800
to take over the hormone-controlling job -- that’s
the placenta.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.419
The placenta is one of the defining and most
amazing structures in the mammalian class.

00:04:55.419 --> 00:05:00.460
It’s an organ that only appears during pregnancy,
and is created by the melding of both maternal

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:01.810
and embryonic tissues.

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:05.960
Together with the umbilical cord, it provides
for the direct transfer of nutrients, hormones,

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.020
and wastes between mother and offspring.

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.770
These elements start to really take shape
after implantation is complete, and we enter

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:16.520
the embryonic stage. This is where the blastocyst
differentiates into various cell types and

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:21.350
develops into a legit embryo, surrounded by
an amniotic sac, and hooked up to the placenta.

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:24.910
And around the end of week eight, this tiny
thing is now officially a fetus.

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:29.190
Over the next several months, it rapidly develops
organ systems and bones, and grows into what

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:30.539
you see in the delivery room.

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:33.850
But rather than focus on those changes, I
want to look more at what profound, and frankly

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:36.870
sometimes bizarre, adaptations the mother
is going through.

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:39.810
The most obvious changes are of course the
anatomical changes.

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:42.130
Basically, everything’s getting huge.

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:46.720
Her breasts swell and engorge with blood,
and her baby bump gains dimension as the normally

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:50.789
fist-sized uterus expands, pushing organs
out of the way until it pretty much takes

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:53.850
up the entire abdominal cavity from the diaphragm
to the bladder.

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:57.620
The growing placenta is still secreting estrogen
and progesterone, but it’s also pumping

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:02.569
out relaxin, a hormone that loosens joints
and ligaments to increase flexibility, and

00:06:02.569 --> 00:06:05.860
it also releases human placental lactogen,
or hPL.

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:09.710
This hormone cocktail does helpful stuff like
tell the fetus to grow, and get the breasts

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:14.440
ready to lactate, and it also causes the mother’s
body to start hoarding glucose for the fetus to use.

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:18.020
This increase in metabolism, combined with
the fact that the kidneys also have to process

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:22.760
waste from the fetus, leads to greater urine production,
which every expectant mother is familiar with.

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:27.419
It also has a huge effect on the cardiovascular
system, because a pregnant woman’s blood

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:29.899
volume can increase by as much as 40 percent.

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:31.280
40 PERCENT!

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:35.100
Imagine walking around with an extra 2 liter
bottle’s worth of blood in your body, and

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:38.300
how much harder your heart would have to work
to move it all around.

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:42.389
This increased blood flow and pressure can
actually make your gums swell and bleed, and

00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:47.180
fluid retention can literally change the shape
of your corneas, potentially blurring your vision.

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:51.740
Not only that, but the expanded uterus compresses
pelvic blood vessels, affecting veins’ ability

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:56.310
to bring blood up from the lower limbs, resulting
in swelling, varicose veins, and if all that

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:57.900
weren’t bad enough, hemorrhoids.

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:03.080
Fortunately, every pregnancy eventually comes
to an end, usually about 38 to 40 weeks after

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:04.930
fertilization, if all goes as planned.

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:10.060
But unfortunately, the process of getting
the baby out is pretty much a painful mess.

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:13.130
Ask any mother -- giving birth is not for
the faint of heart.

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:18.020
The process of preparing the body for labor,
and then actually initiating it, begins -- AGAIN!

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:19.349
-- with a change in hormones.

00:07:19.349 --> 00:07:22.810
Up until the last few weeks before birth,
the placenta has been kicking out equally

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:25.210
high amounts of both progesterone and estrogen.

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:29.430
One of progesterone’s main jobs has been
to keep the smooth muscles in the uterus relaxed,

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:32.259
so they can’t contract and stimulate labor
too early.

00:07:32.259 --> 00:07:35.990
But as the due date nears, the mother undergoes
a sudden decline in progesterone.

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:40.810
Now, estrogen takes over. This is partially
because the fetus itself is ready to go, and

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:44.800
it starts releasing hormones like cortisol,
that tell the placenta to release even more

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.789
estrogen to get the uterus ready for birth.

00:07:46.789 --> 00:07:50.849
Just like hCG calls the shots around the
time of implantation, here estrogen is

00:07:50.849 --> 00:07:52.380
barking out all kinds of orders.

00:07:52.389 --> 00:07:56.229
For one thing, it prepares the uterus to start
receiving new chemical signals, by triggering

00:07:56.229 --> 00:08:00.210
its myometrial cells to start making receptors
for the hormone oxytocin.

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:04.810
It also triggers the formation of gap junctions
between smooth muscle cells in the uterus

00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:08.889
-- this will let individual muscle cells contract
simultaneously when the time comes.

00:08:08.889 --> 00:08:13.310
Then, as labor nears, special cells in the
fetus itself start secreting oxytocin, which

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:17.680
binds to all the newly-minted receptors and
tells the placenta to release prostaglandins.

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:21.819
Together, both of these hormones -- oxytocin
and prostaglandins -- stimulate the uterine

00:08:21.819 --> 00:08:23.479
muscles to start contracting.

00:08:23.479 --> 00:08:27.410
When the contractions get strong enough to
distend the cervix, it stimulates the release

00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:31.669
of even more oxytocin and prostaglandins,
which keep the contractions rolling in one

00:08:31.669 --> 00:08:34.800
big positive feedback loop, initiating labor.

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:38.519
The earliest stage of labor, dilation, is
the period from when the first contractions

00:08:38.519 --> 00:08:42.450
begin, to when the cervix becomes fully dilated,
to about 10 centimeters.

00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:47.089
During this time, each new contraction pushes
the infant’s head against the cervix, causing

00:08:47.089 --> 00:08:48.839
the cervix to thin and dilate.

00:08:48.839 --> 00:08:53.610
Once the cervix is fully dilated, the mother
should feel urge to push. The resulting expulsion

00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:58.519
stage lasts from full dilation through crowning
and actual delivery, as the infant is pushed

00:08:58.519 --> 00:09:00.990
head-first through the cervix and out the
vagina.

00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:05.089
But even after the baby is out, the mother
still has a placenta to get out. Within about

00:09:05.089 --> 00:09:10.190
30 minutes of delivery, strong contractions
carry out the placental stage of labor, dislodging

00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:13.440
the placenta from the uterine wall to deliver
the so-called afterbirth.

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:18.660
Then, finally, the mother can rest, and marvel
at how her body just built another tiny body

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:22.960
inside it -- complete with all the complex
systems we’ve spent the last year talking about.

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:27.320
And maybe someday that little baby will grow
up and get a twinkle in its eye, and combine

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:30.769
alleles with somebody else, and start the
whole process over again.

00:09:30.769 --> 00:09:33.980
And that is how the human race continues to
exist.

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:38.350
Today you learned about the stages of pregnancy,
beginning with how a zygote develops into

00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:43.600
blastomeres to a morula to a blastocyst and
finally to an embryo and a fetus. You also

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:47.500
learned about the amazing anatomical changes
that take place in the mother, and the hormonal

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:51.589
sequence of events that lead to labor. After
that, all you have to worry about is how you’re

00:09:51.589 --> 00:09:53.120
gonna put the little thing through college.
