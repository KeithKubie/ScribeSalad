00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.900
 
bye

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910
 
 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.700
 
people who have been who are young

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710
people who have been who are young
 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.720
people who have been who are young
actually and even have been vaccinated

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:15.730
actually and even have been vaccinated
 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.170
actually and even have been vaccinated
they have very little protection against

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:19.180
they have very little protection against
 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:21.839
they have very little protection against
this on the other hand people over the

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:21.849
this on the other hand people over the
 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:23.940
this on the other hand people over the
age of 60 have been shown to have some

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:23.950
age of 60 have been shown to have some
 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:26.730
age of 60 have been shown to have some
pre-existing immunity and a rich is an

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:26.740
pre-existing immunity and a rich is an
 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.560
pre-existing immunity and a rich is an
immunity which is able to neutralize

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:28.570
immunity which is able to neutralize
 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.769
immunity which is able to neutralize
this virus so this is one of the few

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:31.779
this virus so this is one of the few
 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:35.130
this virus so this is one of the few
things where old age really is good in

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:35.140
things where old age really is good in
 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.740
things where old age really is good in
terms of this h1n1 virus so the older

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:37.750
terms of this h1n1 virus so the older
 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.889
terms of this h1n1 virus so the older
ones sitting around here and standing

00:00:40.889 --> 00:00:40.899
ones sitting around here and standing
 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:44.759
ones sitting around here and standing
around here much more protected and the

00:00:44.759 --> 00:00:44.769
around here much more protected and the
 

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:48.380
around here much more protected and the
reason for that is that this virus is

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390
reason for that is that this virus is
 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.200
reason for that is that this virus is
h1n1 virus is actually derived from this

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210
h1n1 virus is actually derived from this
 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.440
h1n1 virus is actually derived from this
1918 virus
