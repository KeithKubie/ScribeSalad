ANURAG WADEHRA:
Welcome, everyone.

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:09.750
Welcome to Talks at Google.

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.980
My name is Anurag Wadehra
with the Google Cloud.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:14.660
It's a unique occasion
and a privilege

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:20.270
for me to host this
event for Google.

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.750
I'll start with a
very simple story.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:25.540
I grew up in Delhi
in a household

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:30.040
where both my grandparents
were refugees from Pakistan.

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:34.040
So partition was not
dinnertime topic.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.430
In fact, it was a lived reality.

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.080
Every day, we talked about an
uncle who didn't quite make it,

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.650
an aunt who was lost
somewhere in the journey,

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.480
or somebody who lost
their fortune overnight.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.640
These were the tales we grew
up with in our household.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.460
Yet, when we went
to school, there

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.350
was nary a mention of
any of these realities.

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.960
What we read in textbooks were
the grand history, the leaders,

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.990
like Nehru, Jinnah,
Gandhi, Mountbatten,

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.310
who saved us or savaged us--
depending upon the side you

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.420
were on--

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.820
and who delivered
us independence.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.870
All that was completely
contrary to the actual

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.890
lived experiences of 10
million people or more

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.880
who were displaced by partition.

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.390
Fortunately, a lot has
changed in last 20 years.

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.060
And I'm here to introduce
two institutions that have

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.755
been doing phenomenal work.

00:01:33.755 --> 00:01:37.190
The first one is 1947
Partition Archive,

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.190
that has been collecting
the stories and testimonies

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.470
of the survivors of partition.

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.560
And the second institution
is EnActe Arts,

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.040
that has been working on some
interesting and creative ways

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.510
to bring many of
these stories to life.

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.960
So let's begin
with the first set

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:59.270
of guests for the 1947 Archive.

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.618
Let's roll with a video.

00:02:02.618 --> 00:02:03.284
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:02:03.284 --> 00:02:06.200
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.480
- I feel like I'm a
[INAUDIBLE] plant.

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.530
[INAUDIBLE] can
be put here, here.

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:15.500
I have no roots.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:16.468
[LAUGH]

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.720
- And I remember my mother made
me sit down, tear all the bed

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.130
sheets.

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:27.300
And then I knew why.

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.930
Because all these wounded
people who were coming in.

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.626
She had converted one place
for clearing their wounds.

00:03:35.626 --> 00:03:38.614
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:04:34.887 --> 00:04:35.470
[END PLAYBACK]

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.428
ANURAG WADEHRA: Why don't
we invite the guests?

00:04:37.428 --> 00:04:40.910
Please join, three of you.

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:44.410
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:47.920
Let me do quick introductions
to the unique guests from 1947

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.510
Partition Archive.

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:51.520
I have over here
Guneeta Singh Bella,

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.830
who is currently the executive
director of 1947 Partition

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:55.330
Archive.

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.210
She was born in Delhi and
immigrated with her parents

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:59.950
to US when she was 10.

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:02.980
And during a trip to
Hiroshima in 2008,

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:04.870
she was deeply moved
by the oral histories

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:08.350
of those who survived the
atomic bombing in Japan

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:11.140
and was inspired to begin
recording oral histories

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:12.560
of partition witnesses.

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:16.340
She is a condensed matter
physicist by profession,

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.520
and was last seen working
on quantum interfaces

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.370
at Berkeley, Lawrence
Berkeley Lab.

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:25.220
In 2013, she began volunteering
full time for the archive.

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.060
Today, with nearly
5,000 oral histories

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:30.580
of witnesses from 12
countries have been recorded,

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.510
making it the largest
oral history effort

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:35.110
for South Asian subcontinent.

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:36.650
The other two guests are--

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:37.150
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:38.441
GUNEETA SINGH BELLA: Thank you.

00:05:38.441 --> 00:05:41.380
ANURAG WADEHRA: The other two
guests are citizen historians.

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:42.940
And we'll learn more about that.

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:45.830
Reena Kapoor has been a
founding donor to '47 Archive

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:47.650
since the year of its inception.

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:50.110
She became involved
as a citizen historian

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.660
after she heard
Guneeta talk about it

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.600
at the end of a play
on partition in 2011.

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.640
Being a child of partition
refugees herself,

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.410
Reena finds her
bliss in interviewing

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:02.711
elders who were witnesses
and survivors to this event.

00:06:02.711 --> 00:06:04.210
Professionally, she
makes her living

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:05.584
as a product
management executive

00:06:05.584 --> 00:06:07.370
and lives in the Bay Area.

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:11.350
Farhana Afroz is from Bangladesh
and a software test engineer

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:12.550
working in the Bay Area.

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:15.430
She learned about the
'47 Archive from a flyer

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:21.130
at a local grocery store that
read 1947 Partition Archive--

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:23.140
share, collect, and donate.

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:25.660
Her journey with the archive
started as a citizen historian

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:27.130
in 2011.

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:30.340
She has collected over 100
stories personally so far.

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:33.820
She has recorded stories in
US as well as in Bangladesh,

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:35.740
and she is also a
founding donor and a board

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:36.824
member of the Archive.

00:06:36.824 --> 00:06:37.990
Welcome to all three of you.

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:39.110
GUNEETA SINGH BELLA: Thank you.

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:41.068
ANURAG WADEHRA: Let me
start with you, Guneeta.

00:06:41.068 --> 00:06:43.840
So, tell us about
how this all started

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.687
and where did the idea come from
and how did it take this form?

00:06:46.687 --> 00:06:47.770
GUNEETA SINGH BELLA: Yeah.

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:50.530
So I come from a
partition-affected family.

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:55.310
My grandparents migrated from
what's now Lahore in Pakistan

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:57.749
to Amritsar in Punjab.

00:06:57.749 --> 00:06:59.290
So I had grown up
with those stories.

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:01.040
I come from an army
family-- very familiar

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.190
with the India-Pakistan
tensions.

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:05.410
And one of the things
that happened, when I

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:06.730
moved to the US when I was 10.

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:07.990
I went to high school here.

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:09.819
It wasn't even mentioned
in my textbooks.

00:07:09.819 --> 00:07:11.860
And I knew it was a big
deal, because I had heard

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:14.780
my grandparents--
hi, [INAUDIBLE]----

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:16.907
I had heard my
grandparents talk about it.

00:07:16.907 --> 00:07:18.490
And they had talked
about the millions

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:19.990
of people that were affected.

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:21.490
And so there was
that discrepancy.

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:23.470
When I talked about
it to my teacher,

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:25.369
she said, oh, well,
it must not have

00:07:25.369 --> 00:07:27.910
been a big deal, because it's
not mentioned in our textbooks.

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:30.100
So I knew something needed to
be done way back in high school,

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:31.280
I just never knew what.

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:33.630
And the spark came--

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:38.050
the a-ha moment was
in Japan in 2008.

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:40.450
I was in Hiroshima, and
I saw the Peace Memorial,

00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:42.700
and I saw the oral
history archives.

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:45.140
And I found them to
be extremely powerful.

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:47.140
And I realized that
those testimonies

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:52.070
gave the bombing of Hiroshima
legitimacy and importance.

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:55.205
And that's kind of
how it was documented.

00:07:55.205 --> 00:07:56.830
That's what inspired
the documentation.

00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:57.500
That's what we needed
to do [INAUDIBLE]..

00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:59.100
ANURAG WADEHRA:
[INAUDIBLE] the slides

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:02.346
you want to show to [INAUDIBLE]
us on some of these incidents?

00:08:02.346 --> 00:08:04.720
GUNEETA SINGH BELLA: So yeah,
if you imagine for a second

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:06.520
if Hiroshima had
not been documented

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:08.560
and the Holocaust had
not been documented,

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:12.700
we'd be in a very, very
different world today.

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:16.320
For instance, the UNHCR was
inspired from the work done

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:18.250
with the Holocaust survivors.

00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:20.140
And the nuclear
nonproliferation movements

00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:22.790
came from the work
done in Hiroshima.

00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:24.730
Here's partition by the numbers.

00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:26.830
14.5 million people
approximately--

00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:31.060
the latest numbers--
migrated in '46 through '48.

00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:33.370
About 20,000, if you look
at the next 10 years.

00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:36.039
That's about 1% of the world's
population at that time.

00:08:36.039 --> 00:08:38.487
So one in 100
people in the world

00:08:38.487 --> 00:08:39.570
migrated, became refugees.

00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:40.700
ANURAG WADEHRA:
20 million total.

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:41.783
GUNEETA SINGH BELLA: Yeah.

00:08:41.783 --> 00:08:45.170
And if you extrapolate to today,
that's going to be 70 million.

00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:47.030
That's incredible.

00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:49.084
So the number of people
affected-- about 14%

00:08:49.084 --> 00:08:51.500
of the world's population, if
you look at the entire South

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:52.479
Asian subcontinent.

00:08:52.479 --> 00:08:54.270
People don't think
everything was affected.

00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:57.170
Everywhere, there was
impacts of partition.

00:08:57.170 --> 00:08:59.120
But from our oral
histories, we know

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:01.250
that every corner
of South Asia saw

00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:09.110
some sort of influx or refugees
coming in or out, basically.

00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:12.412
We don't even know how many
people died during partition.

00:09:12.412 --> 00:09:13.870
I already told you
the Japan story,

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:15.560
so we'll skip this slide.

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:17.630
But ultimately,
what we needed to do

00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:20.720
was record as many oral
histories as fast as possible.

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:23.270
And we needed to reach
a diaspora of people

00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:24.570
all over the world.

00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:27.890
And so we leveraged modern
technology at the time

00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:32.660
in 2009, 2010, and we started
to crowdsource oral histories

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:35.400
by teaching people everywhere
how to record stories.

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:38.630
And so we democratized the
recording of South Asia's

00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:40.260
history in that way.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:43.070
And so if you go to our website,
you'll see this Google Map.

00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:46.130
So thanks, guys, for whoever
works on Google Maps.

00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:48.350
You can check out
some of the stories.

00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:50.600
You can click on, say, a city.

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:53.810
You'll see stories from that
city pop up on the right.

00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:55.880
And then as you
go further, you'll

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:57.860
see that if you click
on one of the stories,

00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:00.764
you can watch a little
snippet of the video.

00:10:00.764 --> 00:10:02.180
The full videos
actually are being

00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:05.320
stored at Stanford
University Libraries,

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:08.140
and you can access
them there slowly.

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:10.510
And you can see an
excerpt of the story.

00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:12.520
The goal is to record
10,000 oral histories.

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:16.090
And together, all of us who are
volunteering to do this work

00:10:16.090 --> 00:10:19.670
are going to make that
happen with your support.

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:22.080
So far, we're at 5,000.

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:24.640
We've recorded 5,000 oral
histories, which is already

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:27.310
immense, because it makes it
one of the largest oral history

00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:30.150
projects coming
out of South Asia,

00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:31.960
and one of the largest
video-based projects

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:33.260
in the world.

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.140
So each of those stories
is about two hours.

00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:37.360
You can imagine how
much video that is.

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:40.070
About 550 people have
helped record them

00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:43.720
from over 300 cities around
the world in 12 countries, 22

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:46.570
languages, and 3/4
of a million people

00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:50.240
are following these
stories on social media.

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:53.320
So the stories can also be
found in a number of libraries

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:54.940
across South Asia pretty soon.

00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:57.960
That's something we're
working on with Tata Trusts.

00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:59.316
So I'm going to go ahead and--

00:10:59.316 --> 00:11:01.774
ANURAG WADEHRA: So let me turn
that next question to Reena.

00:11:01.774 --> 00:11:03.960
Reena, what's your
connection to partition

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:07.359
and why did you become
a citizen historian?

00:11:07.359 --> 00:11:08.150
REENA KAPOOR: Yeah.

00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:12.060
So as it has been said
by a couple of you,

00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:14.970
my family was also affected
greatly by partition.

00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:17.520
Both my parents were
children when the families

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:21.360
were forced to flee from
what was, at the time,

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:24.210
undivided India,
but is now Pakistan.

00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:27.000
And my mother's
family, in particular--

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.760
my grandmother was a
young widow at the time,

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:30.720
it just so happened.

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:32.820
And she pretty much
fled with four children

00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:35.550
and absolutely nothing on her.

00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:40.020
And I grew up hearing all these
stories and how many people

00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:42.960
were lost and
family members that

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:45.420
lost their lives, lost
their livelihoods,

00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:51.000
and any assets that they owned.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.640
My grandmother was sort
of a legend in the family,

00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:57.450
also, because she was
one of those people who

00:11:57.450 --> 00:12:00.480
got on a train, one of those
legendary trains, which

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:02.760
basically showed up on either
side, on the India side

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:05.160
and also on the Pakistan
side, filled with dead bodies,

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:06.990
because people were massacred.

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:09.060
And she traveled
those trains twice,

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:11.340
once to bring her children
to the India side,

00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:15.822
and then the second time to go
back all the way to Peshawar

00:12:15.822 --> 00:12:18.030
because they were from that
Northwest frontier, which

00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:22.470
even today is a troubled
area, to bring some assets so

00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:24.270
that she could
raise her children.

00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:28.590
And she actually managed
to do that successfully,

00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:31.270
pretending to be a dead
body on those trains.

00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:34.030
So for good reason, she
was considered a legend.

00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:36.030
And I grew up hearing
these stories.

00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:38.910
I also grew up hearing
about a lot of animosity

00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:41.160
toward the other side.

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:43.920
And as has been
said before, there

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:46.590
was not much in our textbooks
except for the glorification

00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:48.480
of our political leaders.

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:52.380
And the story of partition
that I heard from textbooks--

00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:55.080
and there was very little by
way of really accurate history

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:57.360
books at the time--

00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:59.430
was very divorced
from the reality

00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:01.560
of people on the ground.

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:05.970
And when I grew up, I started
to read various accounts.

00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:09.750
And if any of you are interested
in partition, an excellent book

00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:14.650
by Urvashi Butalia, which is
"The Other Side of Silence."

00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:16.950
She was amongst the first
people to actually record

00:13:16.950 --> 00:13:17.590
oral histories.

00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:18.840
And her book is based on that.

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:22.110
And when I read that, I
realized that what had happened

00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:27.330
to people on the ground was
very different than what

00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:31.375
had been sold to the people as
the causality of this event.

00:13:31.375 --> 00:13:33.000
And then the second
thing that happened

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.920
was when I was in Delhi--

00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:39.030
I was in IIT Delhi in first
year, and it was 1984.

00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:40.980
And something very
similar happened

00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:44.370
at the time, when Indira
Gandhi was assassinated,

00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:49.680
the prime minister, and
local people attacked Sikhs.

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:53.940
And willy-nilly mobs appeared.

00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:56.580
And there were
murders and rapes.

00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:59.730
And a lot of what I had
read about the realities

00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:01.620
of partition seemed
to be repeated.

00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:04.860
And these incidents and
the history of my family

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:05.700
really troubled me.

00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:09.330
So in 2011, as
Anurag mentioned, I

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:12.990
went to watch this
play, [PUNJABI] which

00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:15.810
in Punjabi means, if you haven't
seen Lahore, you haven't yet

00:14:15.810 --> 00:14:20.910
been born, which is an ode to
the glories of the old Lahore.

00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:22.860
And at the end of that--

00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:26.310
that play is about partition
and about an old lady who

00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:29.070
refuses to leave her ancestral
home after partition,

00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:31.780
which was, again, a story
I had heard many times.

00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:34.980
And Guneeta, the founder,
spoke about her vision

00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:35.700
for the archive.

00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:36.970
And I was very impressed.

00:14:36.970 --> 00:14:39.870
And I thought this is
exactly the kind of work

00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:41.850
I want to volunteer for.

00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:46.500
So since I have so much
time from my day job

00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:48.390
and being a wife
and mother, I said,

00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:51.640
why not put it all to good use
and become a citizen historian?

00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:54.570
And I've been doing that.

00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:56.220
And it has been my bliss.

00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:58.870
ANURAG WADEHRA: So what has
been some of your key insight,

00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:00.300
if you'll close off with that?

00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:01.675
REENA KAPOOR: So
obviously, there

00:15:01.675 --> 00:15:05.700
have been great learning,
just learning from our elders

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:09.301
about what really happened and
where did these mobs come from.

00:15:09.301 --> 00:15:10.800
And one of the
questions I get asked

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:14.190
a lot is, who were these
people who chose to kill

00:15:14.190 --> 00:15:17.550
and murder and rape and
mutilate each other?

00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:19.500
After all, Hindus
and Muslims and Sikhs

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:22.630
had lived together
for centuries.

00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:25.002
So what went so radically wrong?

00:15:25.002 --> 00:15:26.710
And there are many,
many answers to that.

00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:28.770
But I think the
scariest of the answers,

00:15:28.770 --> 00:15:30.660
really, is that it
was people like you

00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:33.360
and me who chose
to pick up arms,

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:37.230
chose to actually listen to
our very misguided leaders,

00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:40.230
and chose to find
differences amongst us when

00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:42.450
there were so much in common.

00:15:42.450 --> 00:15:48.120
I think if Indians meet
people from Pakistan

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:50.370
and vice versa, I think--

00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:54.540
and also Bangladesh, as my
fellow citizen historian--

00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:57.430
and I've interviewed people
from Bengal and [INAUDIBLE]..

00:15:57.430 --> 00:16:00.209
We find we have more
in common than we

00:16:00.209 --> 00:16:01.750
do with the rest of
the world, yet we

00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:07.990
find it somehow OK
to be ready to kill

00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:11.170
for the sake of our identity.

00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:13.660
So the greatest
thing for me has been

00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:16.960
how watchful we need to
be about such forces,

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:19.360
and how easy it is
for ordinary people

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:23.230
to turn to violence in
the name of their tribe.

00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:24.340
So that has been great.

00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:29.080
The other insight
for me has been how

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:30.970
remarkable that generation was.

00:16:30.970 --> 00:16:33.520
And [INAUDIBLE],, that's why I'm
such a great admirer of you,

00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:35.890
as well.

00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:36.760
Partition happened.

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:40.210
These were people who had lived
in their ancestral villages

00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:44.350
and cities and homes,
had never even traveled,

00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:46.176
had very little idea
of what was India.

00:16:46.176 --> 00:16:47.800
They thought they
were living in India.

00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:51.100
So what was Pakistan and
what was the new India?

00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:54.970
And yet they somehow found
their way to a new life

00:16:54.970 --> 00:16:58.270
and just went about surviving
and building their new lives

00:16:58.270 --> 00:17:01.330
and providing for their
children and got on with it.

00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:04.930
And it speaks to the resilience
and the remarkable nature

00:17:04.930 --> 00:17:07.369
of the people at the time.

00:17:07.369 --> 00:17:09.819
But I think what the
government ended up

00:17:09.819 --> 00:17:13.960
doing was taking that
and allowing history

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:15.160
to be swept under the rug.

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:18.190
And I think that is something
that we should not allow to do,

00:17:18.190 --> 00:17:21.430
because this is a history
that has repeated itself

00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:23.510
and will continue
to repeat itself.

00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:26.085
And as Guneeta
mentioned, the animosity

00:17:26.085 --> 00:17:27.460
between India and
Pakistan-- here

00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:30.045
are two nations that
still can't get past it.

00:17:30.045 --> 00:17:32.170
They're sitting there with
nuclear missiles pointed

00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:33.130
at each other.

00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:36.760
And we ought to do what we can,
even if it is by bringing forth

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:41.200
accounts of the people who
have suffered to inform

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:44.440
the rest of us that just
like the violence is

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:47.157
within our power,
so is the peace.

00:17:47.157 --> 00:17:48.240
ANURAG WADEHRA: Thank you.

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:49.160
Very well said.

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:50.890
So I want to turn to Farhana.

00:17:50.890 --> 00:17:53.735
Farhana, you have a unique
perspective, particularly

00:17:53.735 --> 00:17:55.360
the work you've been
doing with Bengal.

00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:57.504
And Bengal often
gets less coverage

00:17:57.504 --> 00:17:59.170
when it comes to the
topic of partition.

00:17:59.170 --> 00:18:01.840
It has its unique history
related to partition.

00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:03.700
Can you share with us
some salient points

00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:05.725
about that, Bangladesh?

00:18:05.725 --> 00:18:07.240
FARHANA AFROZ: Thank you.

00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:09.650
Thank you for the kind
introduction at the beginning.

00:18:09.650 --> 00:18:13.390
Anurag said that I
am from Bangladesh.

00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:15.850
But when people ask
me where are you from,

00:18:15.850 --> 00:18:19.870
I actually tell them my
grandmother is from India.

00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:23.710
My mother was born in Pakistan,
and I was born in Bangladesh.

00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:26.410
And that's all in the
same land, Bengal.

00:18:26.410 --> 00:18:30.190
And even though none of my
family members had to migrate

00:18:30.190 --> 00:18:32.620
and we know we did not
go through the sufferings

00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:37.180
that your families did, but
our family has seen partition.

00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:39.100
And there is a profound effect--

00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:43.610
hence the identity has
changed over the years.

00:18:43.610 --> 00:18:47.200
When I first saw that flyer
about 1947 in that grocery

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:49.990
store, the first thing
that went through my mind

00:18:49.990 --> 00:18:52.750
was, what took them so long?

00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:55.090
And later I found
out, it's not them.

00:18:55.090 --> 00:18:56.620
It's actually her.

00:18:56.620 --> 00:18:59.740
So I got involved with
the Partition Archive.

00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:02.050
I got trained as a
citizen historian.

00:19:02.050 --> 00:19:06.540
And I started recording stories
in the Bay Area, primarily.

00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:09.220
Then I went to other cities
in the United States.

00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:12.550
And then I went to
Bangladesh, actually, in 2012.

00:19:12.550 --> 00:19:16.270
I traveled to Bangladesh for
a month to collect stories.

00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:20.080
When you hear the Bengal
side of the partition,

00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:24.370
most people think, the Hindus
of East Pakistan migrated

00:19:24.370 --> 00:19:29.440
to Kolkata, and the Muslims of
Kolkata migrated to Bangladesh,

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:30.920
and that's about it.

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:33.130
But that is definitely
a major portion

00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:35.290
of the partition
on the Bengal side.

00:19:35.290 --> 00:19:38.670
But there is another
side of the story that

00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:40.870
are about the forgotten people.

00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:43.890
A lot of people migrated
from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh,

00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:47.440
Meghalaya, and Assam in 1947.

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:50.550
They migrated to the
nearest part of Pakistan,

00:19:50.550 --> 00:19:54.310
which was East Pakistan
and Bangladesh today.

00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:57.460
So what happened is these people
were Urdu-speaking people,

00:19:57.460 --> 00:20:01.690
moved to East Pakistan, and it
was Pakistan and it was good.

00:20:01.690 --> 00:20:07.390
But in 24 years in 1971, East
Pakistan became Bangladesh.

00:20:07.390 --> 00:20:09.500
During the Liberation
War of Bangladesh,

00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:13.960
the Urdu-speaking community,
which was about 170,000 people

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:16.840
at that time, sided
with the Pakistani army,

00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:19.840
because they wanted to
keep one big Pakistan.

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:22.540
As it became Bangladesh,
now these people

00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:24.680
are kind of outsiders.

00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:26.260
They wanted to go to Pakistan.

00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:29.000
They want to migrate
to West Pakistan.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.240
Pakistan, which
is a new country--

00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:32.650
West Pakistan, I mean--

00:20:32.650 --> 00:20:38.320
was not ready to take such a
big refugees, 170,000 people.

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:41.440
So they were left in Bangladesh
in the land of Bengal.

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:44.380
And the Geneva
Convention put them

00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:47.650
in different refugee
camps in 1972

00:20:47.650 --> 00:20:50.890
so that they are not
attacked and they're safe.

00:20:50.890 --> 00:20:53.440
When I went to
Bangladesh in 2012,

00:20:53.440 --> 00:21:00.940
I found out there are 167
refugee camps in Bangladesh.

00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:03.160
And those Urdu-speaking
people are still

00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:05.020
living in those camps.

00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:06.910
Nobody has come for them.

00:21:06.910 --> 00:21:08.710
Nobody is willing to take them.

00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:10.940
And since they
sided with Pakistan

00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:13.690
and they identified
themselves as Pakistanis,

00:21:13.690 --> 00:21:16.990
the Bangladesh government
was not taking them, either.

00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:18.240
So these were refugees.

00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:21.820
And they were living in refugee
camps for 40-plus years.

00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:24.700
They were given a
8-by-10 room in 1972,

00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:28.240
so maybe the family was
husband and wife and a child.

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:32.740
But by the time, in 2012,
42 years have passed,

00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:33.910
their family has grown.

00:21:33.910 --> 00:21:36.910
And they're still living
in that 8-by-10 room.

00:21:36.910 --> 00:21:38.910
And nobody is
talking about them.

00:21:38.910 --> 00:21:41.730
They're not citizens of
Pakistan or Bangladesh.

00:21:41.730 --> 00:21:43.600
They are basically stateless.

00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:45.940
So this has been going
on for a very long time.

00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:50.390
And a lot of people, especially
the Urdu-speaking community,

00:21:50.390 --> 00:21:52.990
they basically
want their rights.

00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:57.880
So in 2008, fortunately,
the Bangladesh government

00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:01.630
ruled that people who
were born after 1971, that

00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:05.590
means in Bangladesh the children
who were born in Bangladesh,

00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:09.280
will be granted the
citizenship of Bangladesh.

00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:11.090
Can you go to the
next slide, please?

00:22:11.090 --> 00:22:11.740
OK.

00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:14.470
So this is one family
that I interviewed.

00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:21.120
The lady who is second from
right, her name is Mrs.

00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:25.720
[? Khairun ?] [? Nisa. ?]
She walked from Bihar in 1947

00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:27.750
because there was a
huge riot in Bihar.

00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:29.680
We all heard about it.

00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:31.780
The lady to her right
is her daughter.

00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:33.520
She was 16 days old.

00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:36.850
She was holding her daughter and
walked all the way from Bihar

00:22:36.850 --> 00:22:38.360
to East Pakistan.

00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:39.490
And they settled.

00:22:39.490 --> 00:22:42.670
And then she had other children,
her two other daughters.

00:22:42.670 --> 00:22:46.570
But by the time 1971 happened,
now they are stateless.

00:22:46.570 --> 00:22:50.290
So this is actually a room
in Geneva camp in Dhaka,

00:22:50.290 --> 00:22:51.490
where they still live.

00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:53.170
This whole family lives there.

00:22:53.170 --> 00:22:56.600
Fortunately, their grandson,
who is not pictured here,

00:22:56.600 --> 00:23:00.340
who is 22 years old, was granted
citizenship of Bangladesh,

00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:02.560
because he was born after '72.

00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:07.210
So this was the highlight
of my trip to Bangladesh.

00:23:07.210 --> 00:23:11.260
I did interview a lot of
people, 60 stories almost,

00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:13.780
but these stories
of the refugee camps

00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:17.710
really stayed with
me, because these are

00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:19.540
the people who are forgotten.

00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:21.220
Slowly, they're
getting their rights.

00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:25.330
But they are really
stateless people to this day.

00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:27.919
Mrs. [? Khairun ?] [? Nisa ?]
doesn't have citizenship.

00:23:27.919 --> 00:23:29.960
ANURAG WADEHRA: Very
powerful and very sad story.

00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:31.210
Thank you for sharing that.

00:23:31.210 --> 00:23:33.190
Just in closing, can
you please share with us

00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:35.380
some insights you have
from the work you've

00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:40.450
been doing after 70
years of partition,

00:23:40.450 --> 00:23:41.997
if you could
summarize that for us?

00:23:41.997 --> 00:23:43.330
GUNEETA SINGH BELLA: Yeah, sure.

00:23:43.330 --> 00:23:44.830
Can I share a couple of slides?

00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:46.812
So these are just
anecdotes from stories.

00:23:46.812 --> 00:23:48.520
So these stories--
one of the cool things

00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:50.228
is not only do you
learn about partition,

00:23:50.228 --> 00:23:53.530
but you learn about
pre-partition culture, cultures

00:23:53.530 --> 00:23:55.325
that are now becoming obsolete.

00:23:55.325 --> 00:23:57.700
So here's a gentleman we had
interviewed, actually, right

00:23:57.700 --> 00:23:59.590
here in Rodeo in the Bay Area.

00:23:59.590 --> 00:24:01.810
He was 107 at the time.

00:24:01.810 --> 00:24:04.240
He's not alive any longer.

00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:07.120
But he told me this one
story that really stood out.

00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:12.760
So we think of chai as a very
staple South Asian drink.

00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:15.192
But he told me about
a time in the 1920s

00:24:15.192 --> 00:24:17.650
when they used to boycott chai
because they were boycotting

00:24:17.650 --> 00:24:20.230
the East India
Company that they felt

00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:22.660
was trying to popularize
tea in an area

00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:25.342
where people didn't drink tea
in a lot of northern India.

00:24:25.342 --> 00:24:26.800
And he claimed that
they used to go

00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:29.670
around spiking people's milk.

00:24:29.670 --> 00:24:31.352
I mean, I don't know
how true that is,

00:24:31.352 --> 00:24:32.810
but that was the
rumor of the time.

00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:35.464
And so he, to this
day, did not drink tea.

00:24:35.464 --> 00:24:36.880
So I thought that
was fascinating.

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:38.650
But of course, in
terms of partition,

00:24:38.650 --> 00:24:42.070
he did walk for miles
and miles all the way

00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:48.270
from North-West Frontier region
over to what's now India.

00:24:48.270 --> 00:24:51.190
Another impact of partition
was art and culture.

00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:56.600
So here's a photograph of a
music family, a music gharana.

00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:58.500
So a lot of music
gharanas were disrupted

00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:01.257
when musicians had to
up and leave and leave

00:25:01.257 --> 00:25:02.340
behind a lot of their art.

00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:05.929
And for instance, there's
a popular story of--

00:25:05.929 --> 00:25:07.470
there's certain
musical families that

00:25:07.470 --> 00:25:10.570
used to perform in the
Golden Temple in Punjab.

00:25:10.570 --> 00:25:12.120
And they now live in Pakistan.

00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:14.700
And they're not able
to perform any longer

00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:17.150
because they live on the
other side of the border--

00:25:17.150 --> 00:25:21.160
so fascinating histories
like that of disruption.

00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:24.340
We're also-- and by accident--
recording endangered languages.

00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:26.340
So there's a language
called [? Toregali, ?] and

00:25:26.340 --> 00:25:28.290
there's a number of
stories now in the archive

00:25:28.290 --> 00:25:30.630
because a volunteer from
the North-West Frontier

00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:33.235
region in Swat who
speaks that language

00:25:33.235 --> 00:25:35.610
decided to record stories of
his elders in that language.

00:25:35.610 --> 00:25:38.070
And there's not many
other recordings, if any,

00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:39.690
in that language.

00:25:39.690 --> 00:25:41.190
Another thing that
really stands out

00:25:41.190 --> 00:25:43.380
when you record oral
histories is the significance

00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:46.080
of the kingdoms pre-partition,
which today have been

00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:48.070
mostly swept under the rug.

00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:50.430
So there was British India,
which is the pink region

00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:51.510
that you see on this map.

00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:57.019
And then the darker region
consists of about 560 kingdoms.

00:25:57.019 --> 00:25:57.810
And so [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:57.810 --> 00:25:59.226
ANURAG WADEHRA:
Thank you so much.

00:25:59.226 --> 00:26:02.460
I want to close off in one
short video that sums up

00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:04.189
the observations, if I may.

00:26:04.189 --> 00:26:04.855
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:26:04.855 --> 00:26:07.170
- Yes, I was named Keerti.

00:26:07.170 --> 00:26:09.400
My father used to
call me, [INAUDIBLE]..

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:14.450
You see, [INAUDIBLE] My father
believed in all religions.

00:26:14.450 --> 00:26:21.820
My sister who was older
to me, [INAUDIBLE] We

00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:23.510
used to celebrate [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:25.780
We used to celebrate
[INAUDIBLE]..

00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:29.500
Then every year, my father
and my two brothers,

00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:32.470
they went to the
[INAUDIBLE] and [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:42.160
was brought [INAUDIBLE] We used
to have [INAUDIBLE] We always

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:43.300
went for [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:44.650
- OK.

00:26:44.650 --> 00:26:48.663
- [INAUDIBLE] I remember
all three religions being

00:26:48.663 --> 00:26:51.374
celebrated in my house.

00:26:51.374 --> 00:26:53.366
[TYPEWRITER KEYS CLICKING]

00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:07.800
And I was 11 and a half.

00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:12.270
And my sister, elder sister, who
was not married was around 18.

00:27:12.270 --> 00:27:14.500
We left Pakistan.

00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:19.520
So we had a very, very
[INAUDIBLE] [INAUDIBLE] there--

S-O museum S dash O dash museum.

00:27:26.170 --> 00:27:28.720
And the owner of
that was a Muslim.

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:31.990
My father left the keys
with him like that.

00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:34.060
And he says,
everything is yours.

00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:34.860
You look after it.

00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:35.950
I'm coming back.

00:27:35.950 --> 00:27:38.090
And he was so genuine.

00:27:38.090 --> 00:27:40.600
And he was so faithful.

00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:45.500
He sent back all our
stuff and sent it

00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:53.907

in the [? army. ?]

GUNEETA SINGH BELLA: Thank you.

00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:03.610
ANURAG WADEHRA: So I want
to switch gears a little bit

00:28:03.610 --> 00:28:05.026
and talk about the
second project,

00:28:05.026 --> 00:28:07.240

a different turn.

00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:13.390
I've had the pleasure of getting
to know EnActe Arts, which is

00:28:13.390 --> 00:28:15.740
a South Asian theater company.

00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:18.430
And I would like to invite the
founder and artistic director

00:28:18.430 --> 00:28:21.240
of EnActe Arts on stage.

VINITA SUD BELANI: OK.

00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:34.111
ANURAG WADEHRA: --which I
thought was very interesting,

00:28:34.111 --> 00:28:36.530
which said, the borders that
separate us are political,

00:28:36.530 --> 00:28:38.920
but the ties that
bind us are cultural.

00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:40.990
I thought that summed up
your mission quite well.

00:28:40.990 --> 00:28:41.612
Thank you.

00:28:41.612 --> 00:28:42.820
VINITA SUD BELANI: Thank you.

00:28:42.820 --> 00:28:44.830
Thank you, Anurag,
and a very special

00:28:44.830 --> 00:28:49.030
thank you Anurag for
arranging this Talk at Google.

00:28:49.030 --> 00:28:52.550
We are in such august company.

00:28:52.550 --> 00:28:57.910
So if the archive is the
repository of stories,

00:28:57.910 --> 00:29:00.130
then EnActe and
Noorani Dance, who

00:29:00.130 --> 00:29:02.470
is our co-conspirator
in this project,

00:29:02.470 --> 00:29:04.630
we are the tellers of stories.

00:29:04.630 --> 00:29:07.030
We tell stories through
dance, through music.

00:29:07.030 --> 00:29:08.410
I hope you noticed
the music that

00:29:08.410 --> 00:29:11.560
was playing in the
beginning when you came in

00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:12.730
and when you sat down.

00:29:12.730 --> 00:29:14.260
That was Raginder
Singh Momi, who

00:29:14.260 --> 00:29:16.870
is the music composer of
the play, the part that I'm

00:29:16.870 --> 00:29:18.730
going to talk about.

00:29:18.730 --> 00:29:23.190
I have here several
actors, directors

00:29:23.190 --> 00:29:25.540
who are part of EnActe.

00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:26.980
What does EnActe do?

00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:28.780
We tell stories.

00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:32.230
We create contemporary
theatrical storytelling

00:29:32.230 --> 00:29:34.930
projects that start
conversations,

00:29:34.930 --> 00:29:38.620
that start conversations about
our history, about our culture,

00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:42.460
about our religions, and
essentially about our place

00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:45.520
as South Asians in
global society today.

00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:48.730
We are the people who--

00:29:48.730 --> 00:29:53.380
because we are in America,
we are an immigrant community

00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:54.670
in America--

00:29:54.670 --> 00:29:59.770
we create a platform that
allows the next generation

00:29:59.770 --> 00:30:05.740
to embrace who they are
and where they came from

00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:09.250
and give them the tools to
create a new culture that

00:30:09.250 --> 00:30:12.350
is an amalgamation of the
culture that they came from

00:30:12.350 --> 00:30:15.280
and the land that
they live in now.

00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:17.260
So that's EnActe Arts.

00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:18.930
We do theatrical projects.

00:30:18.930 --> 00:30:21.160
Noorani Dance has
the same mission,

00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:22.450
but they do it through dance.

00:30:22.450 --> 00:30:25.990
The founder of Noorani Dance
is in Pakistan right now.

00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:28.210
She is born and brought
up in the Bay Area.

00:30:28.210 --> 00:30:30.040
Her name is Farah
Yasmeen Shaikh.

00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:34.780
And she is, as we speak,
performing a dance piece

00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:37.870
on the story on the life
of Noor Jahan in Lahore,

00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:39.220
where Noor Jahan was buried.

00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:41.740
So we not only
create stories here,

00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:45.940
we take them back to
where they belong.

00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:51.250
There's a few things about us
as a South Asian population

00:30:51.250 --> 00:30:55.275
in the diaspora out of
our own South Asian roots.

00:30:58.150 --> 00:31:00.330
The South Asians
in the Bay Area--

00:31:00.330 --> 00:31:05.360
we tend to follow the
three gods of education.

00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:09.200
And the three gods of education
are doctor, lawyer, engineer.

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:11.400
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:13.730
Some of us have a
[? kick in the step. ?]

00:31:13.730 --> 00:31:18.930
However, following the three
gods of education-- doctor,

00:31:18.930 --> 00:31:22.440
lawyer, engineer-- means that
we have become a model minority

00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:23.910
in countries like the US.

00:31:23.910 --> 00:31:24.840
We behave ourselves.

00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:26.100
We own a fair amount of money.

00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:30.440
We look good on paper.

00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:32.370
What we don't stop
to think about

00:31:32.370 --> 00:31:38.490
is that the children that
are born to these three gods

00:31:38.490 --> 00:31:43.410
are not necessarily using the
same filter that was applied

00:31:43.410 --> 00:31:44.620
to the people who came here.

00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:46.360
They're a normal population.

00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:49.680
So there are as many
dancers, actors, artists,

00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:52.470
playwrights amongst
this population

00:31:52.470 --> 00:31:54.810
as there are in any
other normal population.

00:31:54.810 --> 00:31:57.000
And who is serving that need?

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.190
Well, that is us.

00:31:59.190 --> 00:32:01.350
So what do we do?

00:32:01.350 --> 00:32:03.780
In the environment
that we live in,

00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:07.050
there are three kinds of
storytellers that we have--

00:32:07.050 --> 00:32:10.050
the professional storytellers.

00:32:10.050 --> 00:32:11.690
There is Kunal in
the background here.

00:32:11.690 --> 00:32:12.930
There he is, Kunal.

00:32:12.930 --> 00:32:15.450
He's a professional actor.

00:32:15.450 --> 00:32:16.950
He is making his way.

00:32:16.950 --> 00:32:18.940
He is an integral
part of EnActe.

00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:20.150
He actually works at EnActe.

00:32:20.150 --> 00:32:21.880
He's our marketing manager.

00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:23.220
He's a professional actor.

00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:26.370
And talk to him about his story.

00:32:26.370 --> 00:32:29.760
That's one kind of storyteller.

00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:31.440
There is a second
kind of storyteller

00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:36.630
that is a wannabe, somebody
who wants to be in the arts

00:32:36.630 --> 00:32:38.250
but needs the training.

00:32:38.250 --> 00:32:42.030
Then there is a third kind
of performer, actor, theater

00:32:42.030 --> 00:32:46.530
person who we call the
second career person.

00:32:46.530 --> 00:32:49.860
That's the Googlers
in the room who,

00:32:49.860 --> 00:32:54.330
in their copious amounts of free
time, go into community theater

00:32:54.330 --> 00:32:55.560
somewhere.

00:32:55.560 --> 00:33:00.090
So EnActe is one of the only
theater companies in the US,

00:33:00.090 --> 00:33:03.360
that actually caters to
all three kinds of talents.

00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:05.950
We have aspire productions
for community theaters.

00:33:05.950 --> 00:33:07.650
We have hybrid productions.

00:33:07.650 --> 00:33:09.490
And we have professional
productions.

00:33:09.490 --> 00:33:12.630
Our professional productions
tend to be large.

00:33:12.630 --> 00:33:16.350
We collaborate with a lot of
people, especially musicians

00:33:16.350 --> 00:33:19.410
and dancers, because in
the South Asian tradition

00:33:19.410 --> 00:33:23.430
of storytelling, it's
almost impossible

00:33:23.430 --> 00:33:27.630
to tell the story without the
dance and the music associated

00:33:27.630 --> 00:33:29.710
with the flavor of that story.

00:33:29.710 --> 00:33:34.120
So I'm going to talk to you a
little bit about "The Parting,"

00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:40.200
which is a play which tells
the story of the partition.

00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:42.450
Guneeta and all the
citizen historians

00:33:42.450 --> 00:33:46.650
have done such an incredible
job of capturing these stories.

00:33:46.650 --> 00:33:51.630
It is now our job to bring these
stories to where all of you

00:33:51.630 --> 00:33:53.340
are.

00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:59.700
And as they mentioned, the
stories, the historic accuracy

00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:04.710
of that period does not
come from the political

00:34:04.710 --> 00:34:12.090
and the party line briefs
that were given to us.

00:34:12.090 --> 00:34:14.400
The British cannot
write that story.

00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:16.620
[INAUDIBLE] cannot
write that story.

00:34:16.620 --> 00:34:20.610
That story is written by
the people who experienced,

00:34:20.610 --> 00:34:24.120
who stepped across that line
that was made in such a hurry

00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:30.150
and found themselves in their
own country to be refugees.

00:34:30.150 --> 00:34:32.600
That's the story
we want to tell.

00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:35.270
But today, I am
going to tell you

00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:42.350
a story that sort of
encapsulates everything

00:34:42.350 --> 00:34:43.350
that we're trying to do.

00:34:43.350 --> 00:34:47.290
And I want to bring on stage a
very special person, Mr. Ravi

00:34:47.290 --> 00:34:48.488
Chopra.

00:34:48.488 --> 00:34:50.883
[APPLAUSE]

00:34:56.152 --> 00:34:58.269
RAVI CHOPRA: [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:58.269 --> 00:35:00.310
VINITA SUD BELANI: Ravi
ji is very special to us.

00:35:00.310 --> 00:35:04.760
He has been an actor with
us for a very long time.

00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:06.910
I am not going to give an
introduction to Ravi ji.

00:35:06.910 --> 00:35:09.310
We are just going to jump
straight into his story.

00:35:09.310 --> 00:35:13.340
And you're going to
know why as we talk.

00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:19.510
So Ravi ji, tell me, when
and where were you born?

00:35:19.510 --> 00:35:24.880
RAVI CHOPRA: Vinita, I was
born in very famous place known

00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:29.780
all over the world,
Lahore, in the year 1938.

00:35:29.780 --> 00:35:30.932
VINITA SUD BELANI: 1938.

00:35:30.932 --> 00:35:32.390
So you were about
eight and a half,

00:35:32.390 --> 00:35:34.430
almost nine, when
partition happened.

00:35:34.430 --> 00:35:35.240
RAVI CHOPRA: Yeah.

00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:37.980
VINITA SUD BELANI: So where
were you living at that time?

00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:42.870
RAVI CHOPRA: I was living with
my grandmother and my younger

00:35:42.870 --> 00:35:46.980
brother in a village
known as [INAUDIBLE]..

00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:48.390
It was then a small village.

00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:51.688
Today, it may be a big town.

00:35:51.688 --> 00:35:54.820
VINITA SUD BELANI:
And when in 1947--

00:35:54.820 --> 00:35:56.940
what were you doing
there in the village?

00:35:56.940 --> 00:36:01.640
RAVI CHOPRA: So I used to go
to [INAUDIBLE],, the school,

00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:05.040
and learn Urdu from a Maulvi--

00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:13.050
Maulvi means teacher--
and lead a normal life.

00:36:13.050 --> 00:36:18.410
My father was the in charge
police station [INAUDIBLE]..

00:36:18.410 --> 00:36:21.590
He got his orders for
promotion to the next track.

00:36:21.590 --> 00:36:26.130
That is [? sub-inspector. ?]
And he had to go to [INAUDIBLE]..

00:36:26.130 --> 00:36:30.190
So he left us under the
care of one local merchant,

00:36:30.190 --> 00:36:34.260
[INAUDIBLE],, to look
after us in his absence.

00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:37.450
And that he would come back
in a month and a half or so,

00:36:37.450 --> 00:36:40.240
and he would take us to India.

00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:43.120
My mother and sister, they
had already gone to India.

00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:46.184
So that was the kind of
scenario at that time.

00:36:46.184 --> 00:36:47.100
VINITA SUD BELANI: OK.

00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:53.580
So what made you
leave [INAUDIBLE]??

00:36:53.580 --> 00:36:55.440
RAVI CHOPRA: As I
mentioned, we were leading

00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:56.820
just normal life, no worries.

00:36:56.820 --> 00:36:58.380
We were small kids--

00:36:58.380 --> 00:37:02.160
going to school, coming back,
playing with the friends.

00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:05.260
And then one fine
morning, the [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:07.750
of the police station, that's
number two of the police

00:37:07.750 --> 00:37:09.830
station.

00:37:09.830 --> 00:37:12.190
He came to [INAUDIBLE]
and warned him

00:37:12.190 --> 00:37:16.360
that his host is going to
be attacked that night.

00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:20.170
and so he should leave
as soon as possible.

00:37:20.170 --> 00:37:21.850
He took it seriously.

00:37:21.850 --> 00:37:25.510
And he collected
all his valuables--

00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:30.010
cash, jewelry,
important documents.

00:37:30.010 --> 00:37:32.650
And many of them,
even, they tried

00:37:32.650 --> 00:37:37.390
to hide it under the
clothing, all over the body.

00:37:37.390 --> 00:37:41.290
And when the darkness came,
we went to the [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:41.290 --> 00:37:42.390
railway station.

00:37:42.390 --> 00:37:44.340
This was a village,
only passenger trains

00:37:44.340 --> 00:37:46.670
would stop there.

00:37:46.670 --> 00:37:50.010
So this [INAUDIBLE],, I think
that he rightly thought that

00:37:50.010 --> 00:37:53.450
if we get the passenger train,
it's going to stop at every

00:37:53.450 --> 00:37:55.070
station, which was very--

00:37:55.070 --> 00:37:57.320
it was not safe, very risky.

00:37:57.320 --> 00:38:02.280
So he went the opposite
direction, to a junction town,

00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:02.884
[INAUDIBLE].

00:38:02.884 --> 00:38:04.550
From there, we got
the [INAUDIBLE] train

00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:05.930
so that we don't have to stop.

00:38:05.930 --> 00:38:07.430
We only stop at the
junction station

00:38:07.430 --> 00:38:08.972
and not at every
village station.

00:38:08.972 --> 00:38:10.430
VINITA SUD BELANI:
So when you were

00:38:10.430 --> 00:38:11.930
going in the opposite
direction, you

00:38:11.930 --> 00:38:14.550
must have passed
[INAUDIBLE] village.

00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:16.100
RAVI CHOPRA: Yes.

00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:18.470
We passed through
the Kasur village.

00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:22.880
And [INAUDIBLE] was sitting
right next to the window.

00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:28.160
And I distinctly remember
him shouting, [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:32.270
And we also [INAUDIBLE] we
saw fire almost everywhere

00:38:32.270 --> 00:38:34.590
in our village where
we were staying.

00:38:34.590 --> 00:38:36.945
And he was literally
in tears when

00:38:36.945 --> 00:38:39.810
he reached the next
junction station [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:39.810 --> 00:38:43.814
from where we were to catch
the train to India [INAUDIBLE]..

00:38:43.814 --> 00:38:46.230
VINITA SUD BELANI: So what
happened on arrival in station,

00:38:46.230 --> 00:38:46.729
then?

00:38:50.870 --> 00:38:55.472
RAVI CHOPRA: [INAUDIBLE]
you see, this place,

00:38:55.472 --> 00:38:56.930
when we are waiting
for the train--

00:38:56.930 --> 00:38:58.179
because trains had no timings.

00:38:58.179 --> 00:38:59.344
There's no timetable sheet.

00:38:59.344 --> 00:39:00.760
That train will
come in yesterday,

00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:02.602
the train will come today.

00:39:02.602 --> 00:39:04.060
That kind of
scenario [INAUDIBLE]..

00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:05.900
So we were just
waiting for the train.

00:39:05.900 --> 00:39:09.800
And then suddenly
the firing started.

00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:11.920
And all the people
on the platform,

00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:14.790
we started running
to find the cover.

00:39:14.790 --> 00:39:18.990
And in the process, a
bullet hit me on my calf

00:39:18.990 --> 00:39:21.710
and I started bleeding.

00:39:21.710 --> 00:39:25.110
And then my [INAUDIBLE],,
very courageous lady

00:39:25.110 --> 00:39:27.940
with a good presence
of mind, she

00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:32.110
thought of her [? duties. ?]
Sterilize with her urine,

00:39:32.110 --> 00:39:34.120
and made it a
bandage on my wound.

00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:37.710
And we were hiding
behind a pillar.

00:39:37.710 --> 00:39:41.570
VINITA SUD BELANI: And did
you make it onto the train?

00:39:41.570 --> 00:39:43.532
RAVI CHOPRA: Yes,
we did, but when

00:39:43.532 --> 00:39:48.630
the train came, as you
see on the pictures here,

00:39:48.630 --> 00:39:54.500
it was fully packed, people
sitting on the top of the roof,

00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:57.100
even in the couplings
of the trains,

00:39:57.100 --> 00:39:59.900
people sitting in
front of the engine.

00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:02.492
And the compartments
were totally packed.

00:40:02.492 --> 00:40:03.950
And the people on
the platform, you

00:40:03.950 --> 00:40:05.540
can just imagine [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:05.540 --> 00:40:08.210
There's no place to getting
them still, trying to find place

00:40:08.210 --> 00:40:11.660
in all that confusion.

00:40:11.660 --> 00:40:14.810
We were fortunate in the
sense that [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:14.810 --> 00:40:19.190
had known the assistant
station master [INAUDIBLE]..

00:40:19.190 --> 00:40:23.390
And he paid him a lot of
cash and money, because he

00:40:23.390 --> 00:40:26.720
had a first-class
compartment reserved to him,

00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:28.540
his family traveling to Kasur.

00:40:28.540 --> 00:40:32.350
Kasur was a border town
next to [INAUDIBLE]..

00:40:32.350 --> 00:40:35.800
So it was a border
town on Pakistan-India.

00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:38.400
And that was the only
way we could survive.

00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:42.610
So he paid whatever
he wanted so that we

00:40:42.610 --> 00:40:47.374
could be part of his family.

00:40:47.374 --> 00:40:49.790
VINITA SUD BELANI: And so you
got onto the train with him?

00:40:49.790 --> 00:40:50.498
RAVI CHOPRA: Yes.

00:40:50.498 --> 00:40:55.560
I had an assistant station
masters' family, a wife

00:40:55.560 --> 00:41:00.240
and, I think, two small kids,
[INAUDIBLE] family, myself,

00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:02.530
my younger brother,
my [INAUDIBLE]..

00:41:02.530 --> 00:41:06.290
So we all went [INAUDIBLE] into
the first-class compartment.

00:41:06.290 --> 00:41:07.410
And--

00:41:07.410 --> 00:41:09.060
VINITA SUD BELANI: What do
you remember of that journey?

00:41:09.060 --> 00:41:09.935
What do you remember?

00:41:09.935 --> 00:41:11.596
Were there stops?

00:41:11.596 --> 00:41:12.870
And between stops--

00:41:12.870 --> 00:41:15.964
RAVI CHOPRA: Stops, yes,
from [INAUDIBLE] to Kasur

00:41:15.964 --> 00:41:18.380
there were, if I remember, two
or three stops, [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:20.680
stops, the train would stop.

00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:27.570
And at every stop,
there would be

00:41:27.570 --> 00:41:30.060
mobs of people coming
when the train stopped

00:41:30.060 --> 00:41:35.190
and just shouting [INAUDIBLE]
You see, they used [INAUDIBLE]..

00:41:35.190 --> 00:41:38.460
Because from India's
side, the Sikhs were--

00:41:38.460 --> 00:41:41.820
[INAUDIBLE] the Sikhs were
massacring the Muslim people.

00:41:41.820 --> 00:41:44.830
And they used to
shout on [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:44.830 --> 00:41:48.160
trying to find if any Sikh
families, [INAUDIBLE]..

00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:52.240
And our station master, he
would just open the windows.

00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:54.750
He said, no, I'm
the station master.

00:41:54.750 --> 00:41:56.765
I am traveling here
with my family.

00:41:56.765 --> 00:41:59.390
And we used to hide ourselves in
the bottom and lock ourselves.

00:41:59.390 --> 00:42:03.520
[INAUDIBLE] the
first-class compartment

00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:06.160
had the bottom attached.

00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:10.090
Even until very recently,
we had the bottom attached.

00:42:10.090 --> 00:42:15.120
And that is what
[INAUDIBLE] saved us.

00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:18.540
Because he would only show his
family, his wife and children.

00:42:18.540 --> 00:42:19.530
And he had a beard.

00:42:19.530 --> 00:42:26.550
And I still remember that small
beard and kind face, because

00:42:26.550 --> 00:42:28.560
of him that we lived, too.

00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:30.810
VINITA SUD BELANI: So you
were saved by a kind Muslim.

00:42:30.810 --> 00:42:32.460
You were very fortunate.

00:42:32.460 --> 00:42:34.260
RAVI CHOPRA: Yes, absolutely.

00:42:34.260 --> 00:42:43.490
You can say that
[INAUDIBLE] And maybe

00:42:43.490 --> 00:42:45.910
I had to survive
because one day I

00:42:45.910 --> 00:42:49.229
had to serve my country
in the rank of general

00:42:49.229 --> 00:42:50.020
of the Indian army.

00:42:50.020 --> 00:42:52.050
VINITA SUD BELANI: General
of the Indian army.

00:42:52.050 --> 00:42:52.445
RAVI CHOPRA: Yes.

00:42:52.445 --> 00:42:52.840
VINITA SUD BELANI: All right.

00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:54.506
RAVI CHOPRA: That was
a different story.

00:42:54.506 --> 00:42:55.586
VINITA SUD BELANI: OK.

00:42:55.586 --> 00:42:56.960
So we'll come back
to this story.

00:42:56.960 --> 00:42:58.270
What did you see between stops?

00:42:58.270 --> 00:42:59.510
Did you look out of the window?

00:42:59.510 --> 00:43:01.635
Did you have the courage
to look out of the window?

00:43:01.635 --> 00:43:05.100
RAVI CHOPRA: As we
approaching the platform--

00:43:05.100 --> 00:43:07.470
as you were traveling
to look out the window,

00:43:07.470 --> 00:43:10.390
you would see young
girls running and jumping

00:43:10.390 --> 00:43:16.961
into the wells, young people
with murderous eyes chasing

00:43:16.961 --> 00:43:17.460
them.

00:43:17.460 --> 00:43:19.230
And they're trying
to save their honor,

00:43:19.230 --> 00:43:22.520
no option but to kill
themselves, burn themselves.

00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:25.200
And there's a fire
all over the field.

00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:28.220
I mean, there was
terrible scenes.

00:43:28.220 --> 00:43:31.730
We were not sure what
all is happening.

00:43:31.730 --> 00:43:34.850
It's only in retrospect
that they told us.

00:43:34.850 --> 00:43:38.360
And so this [INAUDIBLE] even
on the platform, [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:41.360
you could see the bodies
decorated along the railroad

00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:45.400
track, literally lined up.

00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:48.782
So that was the kind of
human behavior at that time.

00:43:48.782 --> 00:43:50.490
VINITA SUD BELANI:
And what was happening

00:43:50.490 --> 00:43:51.770
inside the compartment?

00:43:51.770 --> 00:43:53.070
Where you huddled in and--

00:43:55.890 --> 00:43:58.770
RAVI CHOPRA: I mean,
as I mentioned,

00:43:58.770 --> 00:44:02.380
as far as we were
concerned, thanks

00:44:02.380 --> 00:44:05.000
to this assistant
station master,

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:08.740
that he would every
time, he would save us,

00:44:08.740 --> 00:44:12.020
because we'd hide out in the
bottom, lock ourselves in.

00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:13.660
Only he would be visible.

00:44:13.660 --> 00:44:15.990
And even the mob will
come, peek through,

00:44:15.990 --> 00:44:19.645
make sure that there's
nobody else and go.

00:44:19.645 --> 00:44:21.520
VINITA SUD BELANI: So
when you reached Kasur,

00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:24.917
that was the last stop
before the border?

00:44:24.917 --> 00:44:25.625
RAVI CHOPRA: Yes.

00:44:25.625 --> 00:44:27.208
VINITA SUD BELANI:
What happened then?

00:44:27.208 --> 00:44:28.980
RAVI CHOPRA: Yes.

00:44:28.980 --> 00:44:35.480
Kasur-- when we reached Kasur,
this assistant station master,

00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:40.100
he opened the window and made
sure that everything's OK.

00:44:40.100 --> 00:44:42.830
Then he told his family
to get off the train.

00:44:42.830 --> 00:44:45.260
And he was going to
say bye bye to us.

00:44:45.260 --> 00:44:49.610
Then [INAUDIBLE] told him,
please don't leave us now.

00:44:49.610 --> 00:44:51.590
Let the train move.

00:44:51.590 --> 00:44:54.890
And let the train move, and
then only, you please leave.

00:44:54.890 --> 00:44:56.480
And he did that.

00:44:56.480 --> 00:45:00.170
I distinctly remembered
moving train,

00:45:00.170 --> 00:45:03.080
he jumped up almost toward
the end of the platform.

00:45:03.080 --> 00:45:05.270
And then waved at us.

00:45:05.270 --> 00:45:08.522
That kind of picture, I
still have in my mind.

00:45:08.522 --> 00:45:09.980
VINITA SUD BELANI:
What a kind man.

00:45:09.980 --> 00:45:13.062
And so you crossed the
border and you arrived at--

00:45:13.062 --> 00:45:13.770
RAVI CHOPRA: Yes.

00:45:13.770 --> 00:45:20.460
And I owe my life to two
Muslim Pakistani gentlemen.

00:45:20.460 --> 00:45:28.460
One [INAUDIBLE] who saved us,
[INAUDIBLE] assistant station

00:45:28.460 --> 00:45:32.882
master, otherwise I
wouldn't be here today.

00:45:32.882 --> 00:45:36.040
VINITA SUD BELANI: Well,
we honor those two people

00:45:36.040 --> 00:45:36.910
who saved your life.

00:45:36.910 --> 00:45:39.070
We are very happy that
you are here today.

00:45:39.070 --> 00:45:41.170
Tell us what happened when
you crossed the border

00:45:41.170 --> 00:45:43.731
and arrived at [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:43.731 --> 00:45:45.480
RAVI CHOPRA: When we
reached [INAUDIBLE],,

00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:48.710
we came out of the compartment.

00:45:48.710 --> 00:45:52.480
Believe me, there's blood
splattered on the [INAUDIBLE],,

00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:55.520
on the train compartment,
the train we were traveling,

00:45:55.520 --> 00:46:00.970
mutilated bodies, hands
hanging from the windows.

00:46:00.970 --> 00:46:03.640
This was terrible.

00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:07.040
So we were-- as I remember,
we were the only family

00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:10.500
survived the massacre.

00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:12.030
There was nobody else.

00:46:12.030 --> 00:46:13.460
VINITA SUD BELANI: Incredible.

00:46:13.460 --> 00:46:18.650
RAVI CHOPRA: And when you think
about the Sikh families who

00:46:18.650 --> 00:46:24.170
took care of us,
giving us milk, fruit,

00:46:24.170 --> 00:46:27.200
[INAUDIBLE] medical aid,
and that kind of scenario

00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:27.920
was there.

00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:32.917
And then from there we boarded
the train to go to Delhi.

00:46:32.917 --> 00:46:35.500
VINITA SUD BELANI: So you went
to Delhi because you had family

00:46:35.500 --> 00:46:36.370
in Delhi, or--

00:46:40.170 --> 00:46:43.172
RAVI CHOPRA: Because that
was the only place to go.

00:46:43.172 --> 00:46:44.630
VINITA SUD BELANI:
So what happened

00:46:44.630 --> 00:46:46.290
when you arrived at Delhi?

00:46:46.290 --> 00:46:47.790
RAVI CHOPRA: Delhi
railroad station,

00:46:47.790 --> 00:46:51.683
when we arrived,
it was jam packed.

00:46:51.683 --> 00:46:54.260
Platform was full of people.

00:46:58.445 --> 00:47:00.730
There was hardly
place even to move.

00:47:00.730 --> 00:47:03.090
So my grandmother,
holding my son,

00:47:03.090 --> 00:47:05.700
I'm limping with my leg hurt.

00:47:05.700 --> 00:47:10.140
My younger brother had a fever,
so he's also tagging along.

00:47:10.140 --> 00:47:14.190
And then [INAUDIBLE]
my brother got lost.

00:47:14.190 --> 00:47:16.160
VINITA SUD BELANI:
Oh, my goodness.

00:47:16.160 --> 00:47:19.340
RAVI CHOPRA: And I tell
you, my grandmother,

00:47:19.340 --> 00:47:26.390
shouting [INAUDIBLE]
brown hairs.

00:47:26.390 --> 00:47:27.710
Have you seen it?

00:47:27.710 --> 00:47:30.680
I was also shouting,
[INAUDIBLE],, because, I mean,

00:47:30.680 --> 00:47:34.520
just imagine having
suffered all the ordeal

00:47:34.520 --> 00:47:37.520
coming back to the destiation
and then again losing

00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:40.430
my brother, whom I love so much.

00:47:40.430 --> 00:47:42.580
I was in tears.

00:47:42.580 --> 00:47:45.020
And they didn't know what to do.

00:47:45.020 --> 00:47:48.127
So there, luckily, I found him.

00:47:51.109 --> 00:47:52.600
[CRYING]

00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:54.588
VINITA SUD BELANI: Sorry.

00:47:54.588 --> 00:47:58.080
You found him.

00:47:58.080 --> 00:47:59.500
RAVI CHOPRA: Yes.

00:47:59.500 --> 00:48:01.860
Sitting, crying.

00:48:01.860 --> 00:48:04.548
I hugged him.

00:48:04.548 --> 00:48:07.304
VINITA SUD BELANI: Sorry.

00:48:07.304 --> 00:48:08.970
So from Delhi station,
where did you go?

00:48:11.614 --> 00:48:13.030
RAVI CHOPRA: We
had nowhere to go,

00:48:13.030 --> 00:48:15.610
because my [INAUDIBLE]
didn't only remember that

00:48:15.610 --> 00:48:19.250
my [INAUDIBLE] name is
[INAUDIBLE] and she's there

00:48:19.250 --> 00:48:24.530
somewhere in [INAUDIBLE] and
that my [INAUDIBLE] has got

00:48:24.530 --> 00:48:28.710
a [? luggage ?] [? shop ?]
somewhere in [INAUDIBLE]..

00:48:28.710 --> 00:48:31.040
That's the only thing we knew.

00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:33.824
So we tagged along with
[INAUDIBLE] to the refugee

00:48:33.824 --> 00:48:34.615
camp in Karol Bagh.

00:48:34.615 --> 00:48:38.040
Those who have seen
Karol Bagh of today,

00:48:38.040 --> 00:48:40.730
there was nothing [INAUDIBLE]
or that shopping center.

00:48:40.730 --> 00:48:43.230
It was total bare land.

00:48:43.230 --> 00:48:45.020
That is where we had
that refugee camp.

00:48:45.020 --> 00:48:47.160
And that is where we stayed.

00:48:47.160 --> 00:48:51.510
And my [INAUDIBLE] would go
in the morning to [INAUDIBLE]

00:48:51.510 --> 00:48:56.620
and find out from every
[? luggage ?] [? shop, ?] do

00:48:56.620 --> 00:48:58.220
you know [INAUDIBLE]?

00:48:58.220 --> 00:49:00.100
Do you know [INAUDIBLE]?

00:49:00.100 --> 00:49:02.360
She's my [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:03.774
VINITA SUD BELANI:
Amazing woman.

00:49:03.774 --> 00:49:05.130
RAVI CHOPRA: Yeah.

00:49:05.130 --> 00:49:11.280
So then one morning,
the gentleman

00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:14.920
said, yes, that's the name
of my wife, [INAUDIBLE]..

00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:18.140
And then he said is [? this ?]
younger sister's [INAUDIBLE]??

00:49:18.140 --> 00:49:20.270
My mother's name is [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:20.270 --> 00:49:21.264
He said yes.

00:49:21.264 --> 00:49:23.180
And then my [INAUDIBLE]
was literally in tears

00:49:23.180 --> 00:49:26.300
and introduced
herself and told her

00:49:26.300 --> 00:49:29.140
that I have brought
his children here.

00:49:29.140 --> 00:49:31.060
And that same evening,
my [INAUDIBLE]

00:49:31.060 --> 00:49:34.960
and my cousin's sister
came to the refugee camp

00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:39.400
and took us in a
[INAUDIBLE] to her home.

00:49:39.400 --> 00:49:45.390
And [INAUDIBLE]

00:49:45.390 --> 00:49:48.940
And we were in rags,
stinking clothes.

00:49:48.940 --> 00:49:53.990
So we changed, and we
got the new clothes.

00:49:53.990 --> 00:50:01.100
And then [INAUDIBLE] I ask you
a question, just what would

00:50:01.100 --> 00:50:04.420
be your feeling as
a mother when you

00:50:04.420 --> 00:50:10.560
know the children you are taken
as dead have arrived safely?

00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:13.710
All mothers, just put
yourself in that situation.

00:50:13.710 --> 00:50:17.120
How did my mother
take that news?

00:50:17.120 --> 00:50:22.750
That is two first-born who were
taken as dead have arrived.

00:50:22.750 --> 00:50:24.000
VINITA SUD BELANI: Incredible.

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:26.410
RAVI CHOPRA: [INAUDIBLE] this is
kind of story for [INAUDIBLE]----

00:50:26.410 --> 00:50:28.380
VINITA SUD BELANI: I
can't begin to imagine

00:50:28.380 --> 00:50:29.740
how your mother must feel.

00:50:29.740 --> 00:50:33.480
RAVI CHOPRA: From what Guneeta
and [INAUDIBLE] told us,

00:50:33.480 --> 00:50:37.000
so many [INAUDIBLE]
were massacred.

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:42.970
Millions were disturbed and
affected, badly affected,

00:50:42.970 --> 00:50:44.310
just kind of--

00:50:44.310 --> 00:50:49.450
and thanks to 1947
Archive that these things

00:50:49.450 --> 00:50:50.700
are being compiled.

00:50:50.700 --> 00:50:52.820
And I was one of
the first of one.

00:50:52.820 --> 00:50:55.616
Guneeta came and
recorded my story.

00:50:55.616 --> 00:50:56.740
VINITA SUD BELANI: That's--

00:50:56.740 --> 00:50:59.047
well, you're a first
in many ways, Ravi ji.

00:50:59.047 --> 00:51:00.880
But in your whole story,
you haven't told us

00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:01.700
about your father.

00:51:01.700 --> 00:51:03.549
What happened to him?

00:51:03.549 --> 00:51:05.090
RAVI CHOPRA: My
father, as mentioned,

00:51:05.090 --> 00:51:06.340
had gone to [INAUDIBLE].

00:51:06.340 --> 00:51:10.750
So from there, he checked
up the [INAUDIBLE]

00:51:10.750 --> 00:51:12.500
so that we have
left [INAUDIBLE]..

00:51:12.500 --> 00:51:16.470
But he didn't know what
happened after that.

00:51:16.470 --> 00:51:21.460
His influence with the
police and the help of army,

00:51:21.460 --> 00:51:25.230
he flew to Delhi.

00:51:25.230 --> 00:51:32.220
But [INAUDIBLE] we are putting
that in our "Parting" play.

00:51:32.220 --> 00:51:36.000
Everybody used to be
glued to the radio station

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:38.315
to know about
their kith and kin,

00:51:38.315 --> 00:51:39.440
say whether they are alive.

00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:40.064
Where are they?

00:51:40.064 --> 00:51:44.250
Because even from the camp's
announcement used to be there.

00:51:44.250 --> 00:51:47.510
Radio stations all
the time, 24 hours,

00:51:47.510 --> 00:51:49.729
who are looking for this son?

00:51:49.729 --> 00:51:51.520
Was somebody looking
for a mother, somebody

00:51:51.520 --> 00:51:52.500
looking for the father?

00:51:52.500 --> 00:51:58.240
For 24 hours, a radio station
broadcast would be there.

00:51:58.240 --> 00:52:03.630
That is how my father learned
that we have reached India,

00:52:03.630 --> 00:52:05.580
but we didn't know where he is.

00:52:05.580 --> 00:52:10.650
So it is only when he
came to Delhi that we

00:52:10.650 --> 00:52:13.050
got to united as a family.

00:52:13.050 --> 00:52:14.300
VINITA SUD BELANI: Incredible.

00:52:14.300 --> 00:52:17.920
RAVI CHOPRA: And we all met
in a place, [INAUDIBLE],,

00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:20.699
where my grandfather was the
manager of a sugar mills.

00:52:20.699 --> 00:52:21.990
VINITA SUD BELANI: Sugar mills.

00:52:21.990 --> 00:52:24.610
RAVI CHOPRA: [INAUDIBLE]
sugar mills, yes.

00:52:24.610 --> 00:52:26.860
VINITA SUD BELANI: So my
father also moved from Lahore

00:52:26.860 --> 00:52:27.430
to Amritsar.

00:52:27.430 --> 00:52:30.830
And my grandfather was also the
manager of the sugar mill in

00:52:30.830 --> 00:52:31.616
[INAUDIBLE].

00:52:34.300 --> 00:52:36.360
We were destined to
meet no matter what.

00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:38.090
We're all part of family.

00:52:38.090 --> 00:52:42.051
So thank you so much
for sharing that story.

00:52:42.051 --> 00:52:42.550
I just--

00:52:42.550 --> 00:52:44.920
[APPLAUSE]

00:52:46.820 --> 00:52:52.040
[INAUDIBLE] The reason
we bring up this story

00:52:52.040 --> 00:52:56.300
is because Ravi ji,
as he mentioned,

00:52:56.300 --> 00:52:58.880
was one of the first people
interviewed by the archive.

00:52:58.880 --> 00:53:03.410
His story is one of the earliest
recorded in the archive.

00:53:03.410 --> 00:53:06.290
He had an entire
career in the army

00:53:06.290 --> 00:53:08.360
and retired as a Major General.

00:53:08.360 --> 00:53:11.690
And then he started a second
career here in the Bay Area.

00:53:11.690 --> 00:53:14.390
Tell us about that one.

00:53:14.390 --> 00:53:16.994
RAVI CHOPRA: You see, when
I came to the United States,

00:53:16.994 --> 00:53:18.410
nobody would take
me as a general.

00:53:18.410 --> 00:53:20.660
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:20.660 --> 00:53:23.120
So I chose my next best passion.

00:53:23.120 --> 00:53:28.010
Even when I was in service,
I used to write plays--

00:53:28.010 --> 00:53:30.170
small skits, not plays--

00:53:30.170 --> 00:53:32.030
skits, act in plays.

00:53:32.030 --> 00:53:37.040
And when I grew up in
rank, then my priorities

00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:40.370
changed, because I had other
things to take care of.

00:53:40.370 --> 00:53:41.760
But the passion remained.

00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:45.590
So when I came here, this
was my second best career,

00:53:45.590 --> 00:53:46.845
which I thought I would join.

00:53:46.845 --> 00:53:48.290
I joined dancing groups.

00:53:48.290 --> 00:53:51.990
I joined a theater group
with [INAUDIBLE],, with you.

00:53:51.990 --> 00:53:53.320
And one of [INAUDIBLE].

00:53:53.320 --> 00:53:54.695
VINITA SUD BELANI:
So I just want

00:53:54.695 --> 00:53:56.960
to tell everybody that in
the play that we are doing

00:53:56.960 --> 00:53:59.600
about the partition,
which is made up

00:53:59.600 --> 00:54:03.830
of true-life accounts
of people like Ravi ji,

00:54:03.830 --> 00:54:08.720
he is actually playing the role
of a very kind and benevolent

00:54:08.720 --> 00:54:10.150
Muslim Pakistani.

00:54:14.510 --> 00:54:17.660
RAVI CHOPRA: In that role,
I'm reliving my partition life

00:54:17.660 --> 00:54:20.240
in this role, because
here, also, I'm performing

00:54:20.240 --> 00:54:22.230
the role of a Muslim gentlemen.

00:54:22.230 --> 00:54:25.200
There, the Muslim saved
my life as Hindus.

00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:28.174
Here as a Muslim, I'm
saving Hindus' life.

00:54:28.174 --> 00:54:28.840
I'm one of them.

00:54:28.840 --> 00:54:29.712
[APPLAUSE]

00:54:29.712 --> 00:54:30.920
VINITA SUD BELANI: Thank you.

00:54:30.920 --> 00:54:32.037
Thank you so much, Ravi ji.

00:54:32.037 --> 00:54:33.500
RAVI CHOPRA: Thank
you, [INAUDIBLE]..

00:54:33.500 --> 00:54:36.110
VINITA SUD BELANI: So it was an
honor to have Ravi ji on stage

00:54:36.110 --> 00:54:37.850
with us and sharing his story.

00:54:37.850 --> 00:54:39.410
I just wanted to
bring him onstage

00:54:39.410 --> 00:54:43.130
because I wanted to
show what the power is

00:54:43.130 --> 00:54:47.750
of a story told in real time
between people and making

00:54:47.750 --> 00:54:49.176
that connect.

00:54:49.176 --> 00:54:51.050
And these are the stories
that we are telling

00:54:51.050 --> 00:54:53.570
in the play about the parting.

00:54:53.570 --> 00:54:56.630
There is music and
dance and a lot

00:54:56.630 --> 00:55:00.170
of audio-visual, very
high-tech elements in there.

00:55:00.170 --> 00:55:02.030
But fundamentally,
these are the stories

00:55:02.030 --> 00:55:04.940
that make up the real
history of the partition.

00:55:04.940 --> 00:55:07.010
And so I want to
now introduce you

00:55:07.010 --> 00:55:11.060
to the person who is the writer
and the director of the play

00:55:11.060 --> 00:55:13.160
and let him talk about
the play himself.

00:55:13.160 --> 00:55:15.990
My great honor to welcome
on stage, Salil Singh.

00:55:15.990 --> 00:55:18.702
[APPLAUSE]

00:55:20.510 --> 00:55:23.180
I am not going to
introduce Salil.

00:55:23.180 --> 00:55:25.730
His words are going to be
so mesmerizing that you're

00:55:25.730 --> 00:55:28.760
going to look him up on Google
as soon as you get out of here.

00:55:28.760 --> 00:55:30.170
So take it away, Salil.

00:55:30.170 --> 00:55:32.270
SALIL SINGH: Thank you, Vinita.

00:55:32.270 --> 00:55:34.970
Several years ago,
as I became familiar

00:55:34.970 --> 00:55:37.160
with the work of
the archive, I began

00:55:37.160 --> 00:55:41.390
to work on a script for a play
that would dramatize stories

00:55:41.390 --> 00:55:45.800
embedded in the experience of
partition, stories of lives

00:55:45.800 --> 00:55:51.230
deeply, irreversibly redirected,
torn as a consequence of lines

00:55:51.230 --> 00:55:53.070
drawn on a map.

00:55:53.070 --> 00:55:55.470
I realized quickly
several important things.

00:55:55.470 --> 00:55:59.210
First, it's an immense
subject matter played out

00:55:59.210 --> 00:56:03.050
on a vast canvas
of a subcontinent,

00:56:03.050 --> 00:56:07.340
and that a terrible silence
has engulfed these stories

00:56:07.340 --> 00:56:09.260
across the decades--

00:56:09.260 --> 00:56:13.010
a silence that has perpetuated
through a combination

00:56:13.010 --> 00:56:17.540
of regret, guilt,
shame, loss, trauma,

00:56:17.540 --> 00:56:22.000
incomprehensible suffering,
destruction, and death.

00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:25.570
And finally, there is
a brief window of time

00:56:25.570 --> 00:56:29.980
in which it is still possible
to gather people on a stage

00:56:29.980 --> 00:56:36.770
and in an audience as they have
a living memory of this event.

00:56:36.770 --> 00:56:41.300
And it's our chance to speak
across generations and nations,

00:56:41.300 --> 00:56:43.940
religions and divisions.

00:56:43.940 --> 00:56:45.770
So this was my mandate.

00:56:45.770 --> 00:56:47.900
I began to write
a play that would

00:56:47.900 --> 00:56:51.490
unlock some of these stories.

00:56:51.490 --> 00:56:53.580
The play is called
"The Parting."

00:56:53.580 --> 00:56:56.850
And I'll really talk to
you about how it begins.

00:56:56.850 --> 00:56:59.610
It begins in a
deserted wasteland

00:56:59.610 --> 00:57:03.780
in which characters
are sleeping all

00:57:03.780 --> 00:57:06.300
across the expanse of the stage.

00:57:06.300 --> 00:57:12.160
Through it walk a young
girl and her grandmother.

00:57:12.160 --> 00:57:15.370
The young girl dares
to ask a question which

00:57:15.370 --> 00:57:19.180
will awaken the ghosts
of these stories buried

00:57:19.180 --> 00:57:21.130
in the fog of history.

00:57:21.130 --> 00:57:26.940
And her question is, I want to
know what happened that year.

00:57:26.940 --> 00:57:32.430
All across this landscape,
whispers begin to surface.

00:57:32.430 --> 00:57:34.890
At first, they're warnings.

00:57:34.890 --> 00:57:36.990
They don't wish to be awakened.

00:57:36.990 --> 00:57:41.600
These are ghosts who are
very happy living undercover.

00:57:41.600 --> 00:57:45.940
1947, 1947.

00:57:45.940 --> 00:57:47.320
Why remember?

00:57:47.320 --> 00:57:50.140
Let sleeping dogs
lie, or you will hear

00:57:50.140 --> 00:57:51.550
them howling through the night.

00:57:51.550 --> 00:57:52.870
Who cares to know?

00:57:52.870 --> 00:57:54.400
Who dares to name it?

00:57:54.400 --> 00:57:56.740
Too much time has gone by.

00:57:56.740 --> 00:57:58.420
No one can even remember.

00:57:58.420 --> 00:58:00.550
We have tried so hard to forget.

00:58:00.550 --> 00:58:04.320
Some things are
better left forgotten.

00:58:04.320 --> 00:58:06.520
1947.

00:58:06.520 --> 00:58:09.280
If you do, it'll be too
much, too little, too late.

00:58:09.280 --> 00:58:10.090
It's too far.

00:58:10.090 --> 00:58:11.260
It's too long.

00:58:11.260 --> 00:58:12.280
Too many have suffered.

00:58:12.280 --> 00:58:13.520
Too many have died.

00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:15.870
Too many that lived who
would rather have died.

00:58:15.870 --> 00:58:18.280
1947.

00:58:18.280 --> 00:58:20.950
If you try to
remember, you will rake

00:58:20.950 --> 00:58:24.510
the coals and fan the flames.

00:58:24.510 --> 00:58:29.140
But the girl asks, "if
you don't remember,

00:58:29.140 --> 00:58:32.330
how will I know who I am?"

00:58:32.330 --> 00:58:35.380
And all the whispers
stop at that moment.

00:58:35.380 --> 00:58:38.350
This is the key that unlocks
the rest of the play.

00:58:38.350 --> 00:58:41.770
So this is what I had for a
shape, a structure, to a play.

00:58:41.770 --> 00:58:47.770
It was waiting to meet a
visionary producer, Vinita,

00:58:47.770 --> 00:58:49.810
a theater company,
EnActe, which was

00:58:49.810 --> 00:58:54.250
ready to take a very huge risk
and put this out there, a dance

00:58:54.250 --> 00:58:59.410
theater company, Noorani Dance,
under Farah Yasmeen Shaikh, who

00:58:59.410 --> 00:59:03.400
were inspired enough to join
forces and, in some ways,

00:59:03.400 --> 00:59:07.270
give me this amazing,
in some ways,

00:59:07.270 --> 00:59:10.990
humbling and
ennobling experience

00:59:10.990 --> 00:59:12.820
of spearheading this project.

00:59:12.820 --> 00:59:15.430
The production is
in full swing, and I

00:59:15.430 --> 00:59:17.290
invite you all to
come see it when

00:59:17.290 --> 00:59:20.200
it does open in the Bay Area.

00:59:20.200 --> 00:59:21.910
What I'd like to
do at this point,

00:59:21.910 --> 00:59:26.650
though, is to bring
back on stage Anurag.

00:59:26.650 --> 00:59:29.770
You have known him as your
gracious host for this morning.

00:59:29.770 --> 00:59:33.610
He's also my story
development collaborator,

00:59:33.610 --> 00:59:38.680
who has helped me understand
what stories to tell,

00:59:38.680 --> 00:59:42.070
what kinds of
narratives to weave back

00:59:42.070 --> 00:59:47.950
into this play that would dare
to paint an image of a moment

00:59:47.950 --> 00:59:52.780
in time, which is grand
enough, satisfying enough,

00:59:52.780 --> 00:59:55.900
honest enough, brutal
enough to do justice

00:59:55.900 --> 00:59:57.230
to this moment in history.

00:59:57.230 --> 00:59:59.530
Anurag, will you
speak a word about how

00:59:59.530 --> 01:00:02.110
you came to select the
kinds of stories that

01:00:02.110 --> 01:00:03.437
have become a part of the play?

01:00:03.437 --> 01:00:04.270
ANURAG WADEHRA: Yes.

01:00:04.270 --> 01:00:05.460
Thank you.

01:00:05.460 --> 01:00:08.230
I have been passionate
about the subject.

01:00:08.230 --> 01:00:11.230
In the last 20 years, I
have been collecting stories

01:00:11.230 --> 01:00:15.580
and curating stories and also
writing some short stories

01:00:15.580 --> 01:00:19.210
on the matter, since it's a
subject was close to my heart.

01:00:19.210 --> 01:00:22.390
And when I was invited to
participate in this project,

01:00:22.390 --> 01:00:27.070
I realized that through the
support of Vinita and EnActe

01:00:27.070 --> 01:00:30.250
as well as direction,
what was possible

01:00:30.250 --> 01:00:32.260
was to cherry pick some
of the stories that

01:00:32.260 --> 01:00:35.710
could shape the telling of
such a massive incident.

01:00:35.710 --> 01:00:38.710
And we deliberately
chose stories

01:00:38.710 --> 01:00:40.730
from a variety of sources.

01:00:40.730 --> 01:00:43.150
Some of these are obviously
imaginative stories

01:00:43.150 --> 01:00:46.060
created by me and others
over the years based

01:00:46.060 --> 01:00:48.190
on lived experience
of millions of people.

01:00:48.190 --> 01:00:49.990
Some of these are
actually ripped

01:00:49.990 --> 01:00:52.600
from the headlines of that era.

01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:55.510
For example, a story which is
the centerpiece of the play

01:00:55.510 --> 01:01:00.970
is star-crossed lovers of
Zainab and Butta Singh.

01:01:00.970 --> 01:01:03.790
Butta Singh was a Sikh
farmer who gave shelter

01:01:03.790 --> 01:01:07.180
to a Muslim woman, and who,
after many years of living

01:01:07.180 --> 01:01:10.390
together, she was forcibly
sent back to Pakistan,

01:01:10.390 --> 01:01:13.600
and how he crossed the
boundaries of religion

01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:16.470
and state to get to
reunite with her.

01:01:16.470 --> 01:01:18.310
That's a true story.

01:01:18.310 --> 01:01:19.900
It was popular at it's time--

01:01:19.900 --> 01:01:20.940
very contested.

01:01:20.940 --> 01:01:22.990
Another that example
is a story that

01:01:22.990 --> 01:01:25.405
was curated from
historical archives--

01:01:25.405 --> 01:01:30.490
a story of a British army
limb fitter, [INAUDIBLE],,

01:01:30.490 --> 01:01:34.060
who was actually shuttling
between India and Pakistan

01:01:34.060 --> 01:01:36.170
armies for almost
a decade or more

01:01:36.170 --> 01:01:38.620
and not being able to
reconcile whether he

01:01:38.620 --> 01:01:40.750
was a Pakistani or an
Indian [INAUDIBLE]..

01:01:40.750 --> 01:01:42.250
And that was the
true story straight

01:01:42.250 --> 01:01:47.460
from research that was done by
many scholars as an example.

01:01:47.460 --> 01:01:51.610
Yet another story around
how a brother is trying

01:01:51.610 --> 01:01:55.640
to protect the honor of
his sister and the price he

01:01:55.640 --> 01:01:58.180
has to pay for doing that,
and the kind of question

01:01:58.180 --> 01:01:59.260
he faces that.

01:01:59.260 --> 01:02:03.800
That's an imagined story from
experiences of many people.

01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:07.450
And finally, stories of
Hindu and Muslim neighbors

01:02:07.450 --> 01:02:11.530
that we kind of reconstructed
from historical narratives that

01:02:11.530 --> 01:02:15.190
talk about how could neighbors
who were living together,

01:02:15.190 --> 01:02:18.380
Hindus and Muslims, lose
trust in each other suddenly?

01:02:18.380 --> 01:02:21.070
And what would it take
to bring the trust back?

01:02:21.070 --> 01:02:21.945
Was it even possible?

01:02:21.945 --> 01:02:23.320
So these were some
of the stories

01:02:23.320 --> 01:02:24.820
that we kind of
compiled together.

01:02:24.820 --> 01:02:27.430
None of these were
selected with the intention

01:02:27.430 --> 01:02:29.950
of horror or shock,
although many of them

01:02:29.950 --> 01:02:31.360
are horrifying and shocking.

01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:33.190
We selected them
from a wide variety

01:02:33.190 --> 01:02:36.340
to represent the range
of possible experiences.

01:02:36.340 --> 01:02:39.730
Ultimately, the idea was to
ask the question that Salil

01:02:39.730 --> 01:02:41.680
had put in the beginning.

01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:43.310
Why did this happen?

01:02:43.310 --> 01:02:44.830
And how do we make sense of it?

01:02:44.830 --> 01:02:47.455
So that was the intention
of these stories.

01:02:47.455 --> 01:02:48.130
Thank you.

01:02:48.130 --> 01:02:48.740
SALIL SINGH: Pleasure.

01:02:48.740 --> 01:02:49.239
Thank you.

01:02:49.239 --> 01:02:51.000
[APPLAUSE]

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:55.300
So you can expect a poetic
rendering of these stories

01:02:55.300 --> 01:02:57.130
when you come to
see "The Parting"--

01:02:57.130 --> 01:03:03.940
something that combines poetry,
dance, theater, acting, words,

01:03:03.940 --> 01:03:06.371
and beautiful music.

01:03:06.371 --> 01:03:07.870
I would like to
invite at this point

01:03:07.870 --> 01:03:11.050
two young ladies who've been
waiting very patiently, Mira

01:03:11.050 --> 01:03:12.130
and Athena.

01:03:12.130 --> 01:03:15.220
They are part of Noorani Dance.

01:03:15.220 --> 01:03:15.880
Let me clarify.

01:03:15.880 --> 01:03:17.380
What they're about
to share with you

01:03:17.380 --> 01:03:19.370
is a little performance piece.

01:03:19.370 --> 01:03:21.910
It's not from the
production of "The Parting."

01:03:21.910 --> 01:03:26.370
It is their way of connecting
to the stories and the material

01:03:26.370 --> 01:03:28.870
and the events around 1947.

01:03:28.870 --> 01:03:32.894
And they've been working on it
as a dance interpretive piece.

01:03:32.894 --> 01:03:34.376
[APPLAUSE]

01:03:36.352 --> 01:03:39.316
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:03:44.260 --> 01:03:47.990
NARRATOR: The train to
Lahore was very difficult.

01:03:47.990 --> 01:03:51.120
The train stopped at
multiple locations.

01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:54.980
And at one point, we'd
looked out the broken windows

01:03:54.980 --> 01:03:57.530
to see the train
surrounded by people

01:03:57.530 --> 01:04:02.070
with weapons in their hands,
ready to slaughter us,

01:04:02.070 --> 01:04:03.940
the passengers.

01:04:03.940 --> 01:04:07.300
The train driver managed
to negotiate with the mob

01:04:07.300 --> 01:04:11.410
and found a way for the
train and the passengers

01:04:11.410 --> 01:04:15.460
to reach its destination safely.

01:04:15.460 --> 01:04:19.960
When we arrived, we
saw bloody train cars

01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:22.510
and learned that some
of our dearest friends

01:04:22.510 --> 01:04:24.820
had been killed on the way.

01:04:31.060 --> 01:04:33.750
We arrived at the
crowded station,

01:04:33.750 --> 01:04:38.200
carrying whatever we managed to
hold in our arms from our home.

01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:40.450
I held to my six-year-old
daughter's hand

01:04:40.450 --> 01:04:44.170
with such a tight grasp,
she was complaining.

01:04:44.170 --> 01:04:46.090
We pushed through the crowds.

01:04:46.090 --> 01:04:48.400
Just as I stepped
onto the train,

01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:52.180
I felt my arm being pulled
back by the force of the crowd.

01:04:52.180 --> 01:04:54.850
I tried to hold on
with all my strength.

01:04:54.850 --> 01:04:59.920
But the grip was loosening,
our sweaty palms not helping,

01:04:59.920 --> 01:05:02.280
nor the herd of
people around me.

01:05:05.570 --> 01:05:09.300
The train was
starting to move, even

01:05:09.300 --> 01:05:12.100
though not all
were on the train,

01:05:12.100 --> 01:05:17.420
and even though my daughter
was not on the train.

01:05:17.420 --> 01:05:19.732
I never saw her again.

01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:33.500
I was 11 years old when
partition was announced.

01:05:33.500 --> 01:05:36.420
While we were playing
near the railway station,

01:05:36.420 --> 01:05:39.935
we were told that a nearby train
was being attacked by a mob.

01:05:39.935 --> 01:05:43.970
We rushed to the tragic
scene, and saw men, women,

01:05:43.970 --> 01:05:45.990
and children being
looted and murdered.

01:05:45.990 --> 01:05:48.560
Or All we could
hear were screams.

01:05:48.560 --> 01:05:52.380
And all we saw were
piles of dead bodies.

01:05:52.380 --> 01:05:54.820
I remember seeing a
baby who was still

01:05:54.820 --> 01:05:58.058
latched to its dead mother.

01:06:08.904 --> 01:06:12.848
Finally, it was our
turn to board the train.

01:06:12.848 --> 01:06:16.299
We were stuffed in like
cotton bales in a gunny sack.

01:06:16.299 --> 01:06:18.271
The doors of the
train were barricaded

01:06:18.271 --> 01:06:19.750
so no one could get out.

01:06:19.750 --> 01:06:22.708
The three-day journey was
filled with tribulations.

01:06:22.708 --> 01:06:25.173
The train was nearly
massacred just

01:06:25.173 --> 01:06:27.145
before the end of the journey.

01:06:27.145 --> 01:06:29.610
When we had almost
reached our destination,

01:06:29.610 --> 01:06:32.568
a group of insurgents
broke into the train

01:06:32.568 --> 01:06:34.120
through one of the
barricaded doors.

01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:37.215
Their swords were
covered in a soft cloth.

01:06:37.215 --> 01:06:41.990
And they said if the train
going to India comes unharmed,

01:06:41.990 --> 01:06:44.330
we will not harm anyone.

01:06:44.330 --> 01:06:46.838
Luckily, that train
was not harmed.

01:06:55.202 --> 01:07:01.340
When we reached our destination
and we got off the train,

01:07:01.340 --> 01:07:05.120
instead of running
for food and water,

01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:09.830
people knelt on the ground and
offered prayers of gratitude

01:07:09.830 --> 01:07:14.684
that we had made it safely.

01:07:14.684 --> 01:07:17.174
[NON-ENGLISH SINGING]

01:07:54.524 --> 01:07:57.512
[APPLAUSE]

01:07:57.512 --> 01:08:00.350
ANURAG WADEHRA: Thank
you, Mira, Athena.

01:08:00.350 --> 01:08:04.010
Mira, this morning would not
be complete without inviting

01:08:04.010 --> 01:08:08.690
you, as a young person in the
Bay Area, to speak for a moment

01:08:08.690 --> 01:08:10.940
about what does it
mean to encounter

01:08:10.940 --> 01:08:14.868
these stories, to work with your
art in reconnecting with them?

01:08:20.130 --> 01:08:21.460
MIRA: Hello, everyone.

01:08:21.460 --> 01:08:23.010
My name is Mira.

01:08:23.010 --> 01:08:26.450
I'm 16 years old, and I go to
a high school in Cupertino.

01:08:26.450 --> 01:08:28.170
I am one of the
performing members

01:08:28.170 --> 01:08:30.510
of Noorani Dance,
founded and directed

01:08:30.510 --> 01:08:34.020
by my [INAUDIBLE] teacher,
Farah Yasmeen Shaikh.

01:08:34.020 --> 01:08:36.390
I'm fortunate to be one
of the dancers featured

01:08:36.390 --> 01:08:38.040
in "The Parting."

01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:40.560
As the dance and music
director of "The Parting,"

01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:43.080
[INAUDIBLE] wanted to
include other styles

01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:47.130
of classical dance, such as
Bharatanatyam and Bengali

01:08:47.130 --> 01:08:49.710
and Punjabi folk dances.

01:08:49.710 --> 01:08:53.100
These multiple dance forms
represent the diversity

01:08:53.100 --> 01:08:57.060
of those that were affected
by the 1947 partition.

01:08:57.060 --> 01:08:59.700
With the actors, we will be
weaving different aspects

01:08:59.700 --> 01:09:02.010
of real-life events
of the partition

01:09:02.010 --> 01:09:05.220
through dance, music,
and a theatrical script.

01:09:05.220 --> 01:09:08.310
We hope to represent the
intensity and emotion

01:09:08.310 --> 01:09:13.500
of what took place during this
historic time in South Asia.

01:09:13.500 --> 01:09:15.720
The partition has
always been puzzling.

01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:18.060
How could a man-made
line on a map

01:09:18.060 --> 01:09:21.660
displace over 14 million
people and result in the death

01:09:21.660 --> 01:09:23.430
of almost 2 million?

01:09:23.430 --> 01:09:25.319
South Asians of my
generation often

01:09:25.319 --> 01:09:28.120
don't understand the
magnitude of this tragedy.

01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:32.460
So taking part in this
project has special meaning

01:09:32.460 --> 01:09:33.990
to each of us.

01:09:33.990 --> 01:09:35.910
Through this experience,
we have become

01:09:35.910 --> 01:09:39.390
more empathetic to the
survivors of the partition.

01:09:39.390 --> 01:09:43.140
And we are also more
aware of the history

01:09:43.140 --> 01:09:45.510
of tension between
India and Pakistan

01:09:45.510 --> 01:09:48.450
and the forces of division
in the world today.

01:09:48.450 --> 01:09:50.609
We hope our generation
can learn from this

01:09:50.609 --> 01:09:54.390
and change the course of
history towards peace.

01:09:54.390 --> 01:09:57.496
Thank you, and I hope to see
you all at "The Parting."

01:09:57.496 --> 01:09:59.861

01:10:00.932 --> 01:10:03.140
ANURAG WADEHRA: Thank you
very much for [INAUDIBLE]..

01:10:03.140 --> 01:10:05.360
In closing, I want to
thank the panelists

01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:06.400

01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:10.040

team, Guneeta, Reena,

01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:11.200
