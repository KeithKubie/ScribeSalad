00:00:00.967 --> 00:00:02.235
Hi there, what can I help
you with today?

00:00:02.302 --> 00:00:04.402
Well, the other
day I was having trouble

00:00:04.404 --> 00:00:06.339
making out this license
plate number

00:00:06.406 --> 00:00:08.500
of a
particular school bus,

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.780
even though I was driving
very closely behind it

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:13.140
for a long
period of time.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.376
In any case, what should
I do?

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.340
I think you
might like these.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.100
These are our Church Basement
Computer Teacher Model.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.020
But actually, you know what?

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.580
These are from
our Uncle Backrub line.

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:26.120
Yeah.

00:00:26.192 --> 00:00:28.761
What a-- Now, do these make me
look like a serial killer?

00:00:28.827 --> 00:00:29.796
I'll take 'em.

00:00:29.862 --> 00:00:30.996
(chuckling)

00:00:31.063 --> 00:00:32.799
Uh.

00:00:36.135 --> 00:00:37.203
How can I help you?

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.738
Uh, I have a special
occasion coming up.

00:00:39.805 --> 00:00:40.940
Oh, let me guess.

00:00:41.006 --> 00:00:42.475
You and 120 of your
closest followers

00:00:42.542 --> 00:00:45.177
are planning on drinking
poison from R.C. Cola cans?

00:00:45.244 --> 00:00:47.480
It's not poison, it's
time juice.

00:00:47.547 --> 00:00:50.649
Okay-- You know, why don't
you try these?

00:00:50.716 --> 00:00:51.751
These might be perfect.

00:00:51.817 --> 00:00:53.686
These are from our vintage
Koresh line.

00:00:53.752 --> 00:00:55.655
They're perfect for going
straight from your compound

00:00:55.722 --> 00:00:58.891
to burrito-ing yourself in a
wool blanket in the desert.

00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:01.360
Sandy, would you like to
stroke my (bleep)?

00:01:01.427 --> 00:01:02.595
Yeah, these are gonna
work great.

00:01:02.662 --> 00:01:03.896
Oh, perfect, perfect.

00:01:03.963 --> 00:01:05.098
I'm gonna check
out some other styles.

00:01:05.165 --> 00:01:07.066
Please do.

00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:08.534
Hi there.

00:01:08.601 --> 00:01:12.005
Can I see how
you look in these?

00:01:12.071 --> 00:01:13.372
Oh, no,
we have a strict policy

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.842
against trying on frames at
a customer's request.

00:01:15.908 --> 00:01:17.577
Why?

00:01:17.644 --> 00:01:18.845
Because you know why.

00:01:22.882 --> 00:01:24.784
Oh, great, great.

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.885
But before I pay for them,
I just wanted to say

00:01:26.952 --> 00:01:28.554
that I feel
very connected to you

00:01:28.621 --> 00:01:32.257
and I sense that your heart
has many questions for me.

00:01:32.324 --> 00:01:33.893
Uh, I've
got no questions,

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:36.729
but we appreciate your
business.

00:01:36.795 --> 00:01:38.231
All right.

00:01:38.298 --> 00:01:40.032
I take it I can pay for these
with jelly beans?

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:41.000
Okay.

00:01:42.068 --> 00:01:43.536
There you are.

00:01:43.603 --> 00:01:44.837
And you're sure there's
no questions?

00:01:44.904 --> 00:01:46.439
I'm actually
gonna close up early.

00:01:46.506 --> 00:01:49.976
I'm driving to my boyfriend's
house tonight.

00:01:50.042 --> 00:01:52.011
Boyfriend--
All right, got it.

00:01:52.078 --> 00:01:54.280
We'll just- You know, say
that first next time.

00:01:54.346 --> 00:01:55.347
Okay?

00:01:55.414 --> 00:01:57.083
Save us
both a lot of time.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:58.451
Gonna learn from my
mistakes-- Thank you so much.

00:01:58.517 --> 00:02:00.820
Great-- Yeah, that'd
be great if you did that.

00:02:02.087 --> 00:02:04.890
And don't put out
such a vibe next time.

00:02:04.957 --> 00:02:06.292
Okay.

00:02:12.532 --> 00:02:14.466
(motor starting)

00:02:14.533 --> 00:02:17.137
Brendan Fraser's house.

00:02:19.138 --> 00:02:20.740
Lock and load.
