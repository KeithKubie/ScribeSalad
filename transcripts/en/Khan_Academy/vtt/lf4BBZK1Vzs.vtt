00:00:00.557 --> 00:00:04.429
- [Voiceover] Li Min squeezed
three lemons to make lemonade.

00:00:04.429 --> 00:00:08.804
She squeezed 42 millimeters of lemon juice

00:00:08.804 --> 00:00:10.972
from the first lemon.

00:00:10.972 --> 00:00:15.418
36 milliliters of juice
from the second lemon,

00:00:16.203 --> 00:00:20.046
and 45 milliliters of juice

00:00:20.046 --> 00:00:21.829
from the third lemon.

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:23.630
How much lemon juice did Li MIn

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.830
squeeze from her three lemons?

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.968
Well we just have to add
how many milliliters she got

00:00:27.968 --> 00:00:30.139
from each of them, add them all together.

00:00:30.139 --> 00:00:33.254
So from the first one,
she got 42 milliliters

00:00:33.254 --> 00:00:36.862
42, and short for milliliters I can write

00:00:36.862 --> 00:00:41.227
lowercase m for mili, and
uppercase L for liters.

00:00:41.227 --> 00:00:43.633
42 milliliters from the first lemon.

00:00:43.633 --> 00:00:47.467
36 milliliters from the second lemon,

00:00:49.373 --> 00:00:52.546
and then 45 milliliters
from the third lemon.

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.188
So we can just add these
three quantities together.

00:00:58.188 --> 00:01:00.500
So let's do that, let's add them together.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.797
So we're gonna get something
in terms of milliliters.

00:01:02.797 --> 00:01:04.909
So let's go first to the ones place.

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:08.404
Two plus six is eight,
eight plus five is 13.

00:01:08.404 --> 00:01:11.207
13 is three ones and one 10,

00:01:11.207 --> 00:01:13.500
so I could write that
one 10 in the 10s place.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.755
So one plus four is five,
plus three is eight,

00:01:16.755 --> 00:01:20.315
plus four is 12, so it's gonna be 12 10s.

00:01:20.315 --> 00:01:22.997
Which is the same thing as 120.

00:01:22.997 --> 00:01:26.570
So in total, Li Min
squeezed 123 milliliters

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.311
from her three lemons.

00:01:29.311 --> 00:01:31.752
Let's do another problem like this.

00:01:33.321 --> 00:01:37.055
Sarah poured five cans of motor oil

00:01:37.055 --> 00:01:38.736
into the container below.

00:01:38.736 --> 00:01:42.016
So this container below has 55,

00:01:42.016 --> 00:01:44.352
let's see this is halfway, it's filled up

00:01:44.352 --> 00:01:46.664
after she poured the five cans,

00:01:46.664 --> 00:01:50.089
and it's filled up
halfway between 40 and 50,

00:01:50.089 --> 00:01:54.344
so this mark right here, this
looks like that would be 45.

00:01:54.344 --> 00:01:57.831
So it's filled up to 45 milliliters.

00:01:57.831 --> 00:02:01.151
So she poured five cans,
and those five cans combined

00:02:01.151 --> 00:02:03.792
ended up being 45 milliliters.

00:02:03.792 --> 00:02:06.311
All of the cans held
the same amount of oil,

00:02:06.311 --> 00:02:07.448
and I guess we can assume that

00:02:07.448 --> 00:02:11.214
this container below was empty

00:02:11.214 --> 00:02:13.703
before she filled any of the cans in.

00:02:13.703 --> 00:02:16.031
So all of the cans held
the same amount of oil.

00:02:16.031 --> 00:02:19.040
How many milliliters of
motor oil were in each can?

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.276
So she had five cans, so one,

00:02:23.276 --> 00:02:27.679
one can, two cans, three cans,

00:02:27.679 --> 00:02:31.456
four cans, and five cans.

00:02:31.456 --> 00:02:34.428
They each had a certain
amount of oil in them.

00:02:34.428 --> 00:02:36.790
They each had a certain
amount of oil in them.

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.459
And when she put them
all in, so let's say they

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:42.180
each have a question mark of oil in them.

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.434
So she had five cans, and
they each had a question mark

00:02:46.434 --> 00:02:49.080
amount, say question mark
milliliters of oil in it.

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.920
And when you multiplied by five,

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.864
when you put all five together
you got 45 milliliters.

00:02:54.864 --> 00:02:57.959
You got 45 milliliters.

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.753
So five times what amount of oil per can

00:03:01.753 --> 00:03:03.881
would get us to 45 in total?

00:03:03.881 --> 00:03:06.632
Well five times nine is 45.

00:03:06.632 --> 00:03:08.701
So this thing right over here,

00:03:08.701 --> 00:03:12.321
five times nine is 45.

00:03:12.321 --> 00:03:16.800
So Sarah had nine milliliters in each can,

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.763
they each had the same
amount, they say that.

00:03:18.763 --> 00:03:21.994
All the cans held the same amount of oil.

00:03:21.994 --> 00:03:25.719
So if she had nine milliliters
in each one, notice,

00:03:25.719 --> 00:03:28.987
if in each of the five cans
you had nine milliliters,

00:03:28.987 --> 00:03:32.337
five times nine is 45.

00:03:32.337 --> 00:03:35.949
So she had nine milliliters
of motor oil in each can.
