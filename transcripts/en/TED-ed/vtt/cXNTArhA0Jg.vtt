00:00:06.827 --> 00:00:10.949
In 1956, during a diplomatic 
reception in Moscow,

00:00:10.949 --> 00:00:15.475
Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev
told Western Bloc ambassadors,

00:00:15.475 --> 00:00:17.468
"My vas pokhoronim!"

00:00:17.468 --> 00:00:21.041
His interpreter rendered that
into English as,

00:00:21.041 --> 00:00:23.483
"We will bury you!"

00:00:23.483 --> 00:00:26.535
This statement sent shockwaves
through the Western world,

00:00:26.535 --> 00:00:29.671
heightening the tension between
the Soviet Union and the US

00:00:29.671 --> 00:00:32.471
who were in the thick of the Cold War.

00:00:32.471 --> 00:00:38.101
Some believe this incident alone
set East/West relations back a decade.

00:00:38.101 --> 00:00:43.690
As it turns out, Khrushchev's remark
was translated a bit too literally.

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.862
Given the context, his words
should have been rendered as,

00:00:46.862 --> 00:00:49.601
"We will live to see you buried,"

00:00:49.601 --> 00:00:53.006
meaning that Communism 
would outlast Capitalism,

00:00:53.006 --> 00:00:55.255
a less threatening comment.

00:00:55.255 --> 00:00:57.891
Though the intended meaning
was eventually clarified,

00:00:57.891 --> 00:01:00.824
the initial impact of Khrushchev's
apparent words

00:01:00.824 --> 00:01:05.973
put the world on a path
that could have led to nuclear armageddon.

00:01:05.973 --> 00:01:10.046
So now, given the complexities of language
and cultural exchange,

00:01:10.046 --> 00:01:14.076
how does this sort of thing
not happen all the time?

00:01:14.076 --> 00:01:18.387
Much of the answer lies with the skill
and training of interpreters

00:01:18.387 --> 00:01:21.326
to overcome language barriers.

00:01:21.326 --> 00:01:25.270
For most of history, interpretation
was mainly done consecutively,

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.441
with speakers and interpreters making
pauses to allow each other to speak.

00:01:30.441 --> 00:01:33.069
But after the advent of radio technology,

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:38.698
a new simultaneous interpretations system
was developed in the wake of World War II.

00:01:38.698 --> 00:01:40.608
In the simultaneous mode

00:01:40.608 --> 00:01:44.071
interpreters instantaneously 
translate a speaker's words

00:01:44.071 --> 00:01:46.822
into a microphone while he speaks.

00:01:46.822 --> 00:01:50.106
Without pauses, those in the audience
can choose the language

00:01:50.106 --> 00:01:52.295
in which they want to follow.

00:01:52.295 --> 00:01:54.727
On the surface, it all looks seamless,

00:01:54.727 --> 00:01:56.256
but behind the scenes,

00:01:56.256 --> 00:01:58.480
human interpreters work incessantly

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.260
to ensure every idea 
gets across as intended.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.068
And that is no easy task.

00:02:04.068 --> 00:02:09.578
It takes about two years of training
for already fluent bilingual professionals

00:02:09.578 --> 00:02:13.472
to expand their vocabulary 
and master the skills necessary

00:02:13.472 --> 00:02:16.672
to become a conference interpreter.

00:02:16.672 --> 00:02:21.110
To get used to the unnatural task
of speaking while they listen,

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:22.603
students shadow speakers

00:02:22.603 --> 00:02:27.149
and repeat their every word 
exactly as heard in the same language.

00:02:27.149 --> 00:02:30.616
In time, they begin to paraphrase 
what is said,

00:02:30.616 --> 00:02:33.646
making stylistic adjustments as they go.

00:02:33.646 --> 00:02:36.665
At some point, a second language
is introduced.

00:02:36.665 --> 00:02:41.510
Practicing in this way creates new neural
pathways in the interpreter's brain,

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.325
and the constant effort of reformulation
gradually becomes second nature.

00:02:46.325 --> 00:02:49.167
Over time and through much hard work,

00:02:49.167 --> 00:02:53.981
the interpreter masters a vast array 
of tricks to keep up with speed,

00:02:53.981 --> 00:02:55.912
deal with challenging terminology,

00:02:55.912 --> 00:02:59.286
and handle a multitude of foreign accents.

00:02:59.286 --> 00:03:02.511
They may resort to acronyms 
to shorten long names,

00:03:02.511 --> 00:03:05.074
choose generic terms over specific,

00:03:05.074 --> 00:03:08.446
or refer to slides and other visual aides.

00:03:08.446 --> 00:03:11.395
They can even leave a term 
in the original language,

00:03:11.395 --> 00:03:14.670
while they search for the most 
accurate equivalent.

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.388
Interpreters are also skilled at keeping
aplomb in the face of chaos.

00:03:19.388 --> 00:03:23.754
Remember, they have no control
over who is going to say what,

00:03:23.754 --> 00:03:26.666
or how articulate the speaker will sound.

00:03:26.666 --> 00:03:29.322
A curveball can be thrown at any time.

00:03:29.322 --> 00:03:32.109
Also, they often perform 
to thousands of people

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:34.222
and in very intimidating settings,

00:03:34.222 --> 00:03:36.881
like the UN General Assembly.

00:03:36.881 --> 00:03:38.572
To keep their emotions in check,

00:03:38.572 --> 00:03:40.924
they carefully prepare for an assignment,

00:03:40.924 --> 00:03:43.166
building glossaries in advance,

00:03:43.166 --> 00:03:45.354
reading voraciously 
about the subject matter,

00:03:45.354 --> 00:03:48.474
and reviewing previous talks on the topic.

00:03:48.474 --> 00:03:51.417
Finally, interpreters work in pairs.

00:03:51.417 --> 00:03:55.940
While one colleague is busy translating
incoming speeches in real time,

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.973
the other gives support 
by locating documents,

00:03:58.973 --> 00:04:00.440
looking up words,

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.163
and tracking down pertinent information.

00:04:03.163 --> 00:04:07.263
Because simultaneous interpretation
requires intense concentration,

00:04:07.263 --> 00:04:10.665
every 30 minutes, the pair switches roles.

00:04:10.665 --> 00:04:14.769
Success is heavily dependent 
on skillful collaboration.

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:17.459
Language is complex,

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:22.041
and when abstract or nuanced concepts
get lost in translation,

00:04:22.041 --> 00:04:24.571
the consequences may be catastrophic.

00:04:24.571 --> 00:04:31.105
As Margaret Atwood famously noted,
"War is what happens when language fails."

00:04:31.105 --> 00:04:34.643
Conference interpreters of all people
are aware of that

00:04:34.643 --> 00:04:39.046
and work diligently behind the scenes
to make sure it never does.
