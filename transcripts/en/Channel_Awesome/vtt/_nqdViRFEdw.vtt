00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.340
Well, with 'The Return of Jafar' doing so well in sales,

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.720
and the animated series being a pretty modest hit...

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.780
...it only made sense to wrap it all up with one more Aladdin movie: 'Aladdin and the King of Thieves'.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.660
A MUCH better sequel than the last one.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.840
Not only is it more cinematic in both the story and its visual style,

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.400
but it actually puts the focus back on Aladdin,

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.060
and the troubles hes going through.

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:35.320
does that make it good?

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.380
...IIIIII don't know if I can go THAT far,

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.120
there are still a lot of things that don't work about it.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.100
But I can at least say I was genuinely entertained, and even kind of impressed.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.540
Aladdin and Jasmine are finally getting married!

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.680
...yeah, I guess they pushed that whole 'three days' thing off a bit...

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:56.780
...But like he said, he's the sultan and can change the law... so... why even have a law that she has to be marri-- Oh, who knows?...

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:57.940
Fairy tales, ha ha...!

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.740
But Aladdin is feeling sad because he can't invite his father to the wedding, because... well... he never knew his father.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.460
But that all changes when he discovers his father is actually the king of the 40 thieves, and tries to rob the wedding.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:16.140
He's trying to get the scepter that's in the palace that contains an oracle that can tell him where the greatest treasure of all is: the Hand of Midas.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.780
Aladdin and his father, played by John Rhys-Davies, finally meet up, and don't know what to really make of each other.

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.720
The father is confused about how he made it to a place of royalty,

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.820
and Aladdin is confused why his father is still a thief.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.480
Both want a relationship to bloom, but both have issues trusting the other,

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.540
especially Aladdin trusting his father, and as we find out, kind of rightfully so.

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.400
The father still wants to find the Hand of Midas and will do anything to achieve it.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.140
So Aladdin puts off his wedding and goes back and forth trying to figure out

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.480
whether or not he wants to help his father and get the treasure,

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.220
or if he just wants his father back to be... well... his father.

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.300
And... yeah... this is kinda the main problem with the film.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:59.100
I give them credit for tackling the issue of fathers that aren't very good fathers, as it can be a very tough issue.

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.500
Sometimes can turn over a new leaf, but other times are still stuck in this selfish cycle.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.160
But... here's the problem: Aladdin's father's cycle doesn't really make sense.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.460
He says that he left Aladdin because he couldn't provide for him and his wife,

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.800
so he goes and joins the 40 thieves, to get his treasure, so that... well, he can support them.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.720
They clearly find a lot of treasures, but he never comes back.

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.300
...Well, okay, maybe they are building him up as kind of a deadbeat dad.

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.060
But no! They try to give him these sympathetic moments!

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.560
Which I'm usually for, except it doesn't match at all what he was talking about.

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:35.080
Anyone that talks like how this father talks about his son wouldn't do the things that he does.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.300
He WOULD be happy to go to the wedding. He WOULDN'T give a crap about the treasure - in fact,

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.920
there's really no point to care about the treasure! He can just go and live in the palace!

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.820
It's all just a pride thing!

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:51.240
But then at the end: he throws away the treasure! Even though he tried so hard to get it, but--

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.980
Wait, Aladdin was helping him find the treasure too! Why does Aladdin suddenly care about this?!

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.680
It's so weird to see Aladdin just abandon his wedding, then be like:

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.940
"Hey, let's go find this treasure, that... really I don't care about!",

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:08.800
but... he does it really cheerfully! And the father is all OK with it and it... just doesn't add up!

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.680
The motivations constantly go back and forth, but not in a way I feel was intentional.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.860
If you wanna see this kind of story done SO much better,

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.760
watch 'Adventure Time' and Finn's connection to his father,

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:24.200
...or even, strangely enough, 'Fresh Prince of Bel-Air' and HIS connection with his real father.

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.580
These shows get it, and they know how to explain it well.

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.520
I don't think this one really does.

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.600
It feels more like they wanna do something with Aladdin connecting to his father, but...

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.060
... they also want a treasure hunt.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.780
So, they just kinda smash 'em together, and...

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.820
...yeah, given the probable short amount of time that they had on this, I guess I can't be surprised what we got...

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.820
But that still doesn't mean that the heart and focus works,

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:50.780
and when the heart and focus doesn't work, the film really suffers, and it's hard to get behind it.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.200
But that's not the only problem:

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:58.180
the first Aladdin was very good at balancing out the characters - everybody felt like they got the appropriate amount of screentime.

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:03.080
In this one, it's mostly on Aladdin, which is better than 'Return of Jafar', where it's mostly on Iago...

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.880
...but all Jasmine does is show some support and then mostly stay out of the picture, and...

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.220
...all the Genie does is want to plan a wedding.

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.140
Speaking of which: let's talk about the Genie.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.620
Because Robin Williams is back to voice him, aand... that's both kind of a pro and a con.

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.180
It's a pro, because... it's Robin Williams, and his improvising is incredible.

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:24.840
But it's a con because, unlike the first film, they don't always know when to cut him off.

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.540
Granted, in the original, they leave the camera on him too long sometimes,

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:32.160
but they knew to keep the focus on Aladdin and the story and so forth.

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.560
In this one, I actually kinda dreaded whenever the Genie was gonna come onscreen.

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.120
Even when he made me laugh, it just didn't connect to anything.

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.540
It's like he comes in and just hijacks the movie,

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:46.720
when we could be spending more time trying to get the motivations of Aladdin and his father down.

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.120
Or give Jasmine more time, or make the villain more interesting - just...

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:55.240
Every time he shows up, even when it's hilarious... it still feels out of place.

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:00.940
At first I thought the songs were gonna be really good. The first one really had me tapping my feet and kinda humming it afterwards.

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.680
But then, outside of a duet from Aladdin and Jasmine,

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.080
they all sound exactly like that.

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:11.600
I swear, it's like the exact same song in the exact same rhythm, just a few notes are missing or changed.

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:16.580
There's very little variety. Which is ironic, because I KNOW more than one songwriter worked on this.

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:20.560
But, for all its problems, like I said, there are a lot of good things.

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.020
Williams' jokes, though they do go on too long, are still mostly funny.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:29.800
They do at least try to tie in some of the characters at the end - Jasmine throws a punch, and the genie gets a few action scenes...

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:35.340
...And like I said, you can tell they're trying to go that extra mile. Look at some of this animation,

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.860
this is the same crew that brought the Aladdin TV show to life!

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.880
TV shows back then didn't have a big animation budget,

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:45.420
so for them to come together and pull off something that looks this good...

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:47.040
...It's really impressive!

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:50.360
The angles, the movement, the lighting, the colors!

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:55.960
You can tell they knew this was gonna be the last thing Aladdin-related, and they wanted to try their hardest to make it good.

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:01.580
And, give 'em credit, for all the action and singing, there are a lot of times where people just sit down and talk.

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:03.960
When it's actually needed and welcomed!

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:07.500
And those scenes don't feel forced, they flow very naturally.

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:10.880
It's just... *sigh* ...once again, the motivations.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.260
There's a difference between being intentionally complex, and sloppily complex.

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:19.420
I feel like this movie had a lot of really good scenes and ideas...

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:22.700
...but no concentrated narrative to have them connect or flow.

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:28.480
So it's a tough call! I don't see it really working as a film, but I'm also kinda happy I saw it!

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:33.740
It was visually interesting, it was creative... you could tell it was trying to have a real heart and soul.

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:38.080
And I give it credit that it was trying to wrap up both the TV series AND the movies.

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.740
It even ends with the merchant singing the song at the end

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:42.220
- those were kinda nice bookends.

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:47.020
I get a feeling if I was a little kid I'd be into it, and... as an adult, there's some neat stuff.

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:49.460
It's just that none of it ever really connected.

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:54.080
But you gotta give props to the directors, and animators, who you know were on a tough deadline for this.

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:58.180
For Disney sequels and shows that are almost never given enough time to be fleshed out,

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.660
This was a valiant attempt to justly wrap up

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:02.180
another Arabian night.
