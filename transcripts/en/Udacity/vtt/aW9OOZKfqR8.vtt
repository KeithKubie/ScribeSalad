00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:05.820
To get the sum of the attendances, we'll be using the d3 sum method, which takes

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:11.800
both some array or less like object, in our case leaves, and an accessor

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:17.270
function that defines what to actually sum, in our case the attendance.

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.060
Hopefully, you're starting to see a pattern here and even for

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.370
something like a sum.

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:25.440
D3 defines it over some collection of data.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.090
In this case, leaves with some accessor function

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:30.860
to customize the behavior of it.

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:36.600
In this case, every element of leaves gets passed to the accessor callback as d.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.070
And whatever we return from the successor callback, d3 adds up and

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:41.970
returns from the sum.
