well when I first started started doing

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250
well when I first started started doing
 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.619
well when I first started started doing
this research and writing this book i

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:12.629
this research and writing this book i
 

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:14.570
this research and writing this book i
didn't i didn't really know very much

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580
didn't i didn't really know very much
 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.039
didn't i didn't really know very much
about insects i was actually part of the

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049
about insects i was actually part of the
 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.240
about insects i was actually part of the
reason why i wanted to do it you know

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250
reason why i wanted to do it you know
 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.440
reason why i wanted to do it you know
some are wasn't one of those kids they

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:18.450
some are wasn't one of those kids they
 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:19.580
some are wasn't one of those kids they
spend all their time just you know

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590
spend all their time just you know
 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.760
spend all their time just you know
running around in nature yah always been

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:22.770
running around in nature yah always been
 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.130
running around in nature yah always been
really a city person but you know I'm

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140
really a city person but you know I'm
 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.419
really a city person but you know I'm
very curious about things so I really

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:26.429
very curious about things so I really
 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:28.790
very curious about things so I really
was very interested in trying to find

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800
was very interested in trying to find
 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.259
was very interested in trying to find
out something about them so it was sort

00:00:33.259 --> 00:00:33.269
out something about them so it was sort
 

00:00:33.269 --> 00:00:35.750
out something about them so it was sort
of amazing to me to just you know that

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760
of amazing to me to just you know that
 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.280
of amazing to me to just you know that
to just discover more and more about

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290
to just discover more and more about
 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.530
to just discover more and more about
about these these animals capacities and

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540
about these these animals capacities and
 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:40.610
about these these animals capacities and
actually to start thinking about those

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620
actually to start thinking about those
 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.229
actually to start thinking about those
animals because because people tend not

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239
animals because because people tend not
 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.790
animals because because people tend not
even to think about insects animals you

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800
even to think about insects animals you
 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.200
even to think about insects animals you
know at least not in the same category

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210
know at least not in the same category
 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.060
know at least not in the same category
to other animals so um so there were

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070
to other animals so um so there were
 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.340
to other animals so um so there were
just so many there's just so much that's

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350
just so many there's just so much that's
 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.720
just so many there's just so much that's
really amazing about them about their

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730
really amazing about them about their
 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.400
really amazing about them about their
behavior about the capacitors I mean

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410
behavior about the capacitors I mean
 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.220
behavior about the capacitors I mean
they can they can do such incredible

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230
they can they can do such incredible
 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.720
they can they can do such incredible
things so there was that whole side of

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730
things so there was that whole side of
 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.420
things so there was that whole side of
it there was you know the way that um

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430
it there was you know the way that um
 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.619
it there was you know the way that um
you know now I'm going blank trying to

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629
you know now I'm going blank trying to
 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.420
you know now I'm going blank trying to
think of things particular things that

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430
think of things particular things that
 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.710
think of things particular things that
are so interesting about well one thing

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720
are so interesting about well one thing
 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.109
are so interesting about well one thing
in which I talk about in the book is how

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119
in which I talk about in the book is how
 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.340
in which I talk about in the book is how
um you know that the early studies done

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350
um you know that the early studies done
 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.780
um you know that the early studies done
in the 20s which I think if still was

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790
in the 20s which I think if still was
 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.399
in the 20s which I think if still was
still being on the 7th is actually where

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409
still being on the 7th is actually where
 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.530
still being on the 7th is actually where
um people tried to figure out how many

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540
um people tried to figure out how many
 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.230
um people tried to figure out how many
insects they were in the air and don't

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240
insects they were in the air and don't
 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.880
insects they were in the air and don't
they they were figuring this out they

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890
they they were figuring this out they
 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.280
they they were figuring this out they
were interested in this because the they

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290
were interested in this because the they
 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.899
were interested in this because the they
were trying to track the movements of

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909
were trying to track the movements of
 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.700
were trying to track the movements of
insight pasts you know particularly ones

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710
insight pasts you know particularly ones
 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.609
insight pasts you know particularly ones
that were attacking cotton fields in the

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619
that were attacking cotton fields in the
 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.560
that were attacking cotton fields in the
in the south of the u.s. so they sent

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570
in the south of the u.s. so they sent
 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.010
in the south of the u.s. so they sent
planes up to um they send planes up to

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020
planes up to um they send planes up to
 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.899
planes up to um they send planes up to
just to try to count you know they have

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909
just to try to count you know they have
 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.219
just to try to count you know they have
these little traps under the wings and

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229
these little traps under the wings and
 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.420
these little traps under the wings and
they're they're trying to count the

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430
they're they're trying to count the
 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.639
they're they're trying to count the
insects and what they found was that

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649
insects and what they found was that
 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.100
insects and what they found was that
some there were just these vast numbers

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110
some there were just these vast numbers
 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.109
some there were just these vast numbers
of them in the air and that they were

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119
of them in the air and that they were
 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.510
of them in the air and that they were
there were a really high altitudes to

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520
there were a really high altitudes to
 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.039
there were a really high altitudes to
very like it 10,000 feet 15,000 feet and

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:54.049
very like it 10,000 feet 15,000 feet and
 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:56.209
very like it 10,000 feet 15,000 feet and
what they figure out over the over the

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219
what they figure out over the over the
 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.410
what they figure out over the over the
decades they didn't really think it

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420
decades they didn't really think it
 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.880
decades they didn't really think it
realized that then at that time they

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890
realized that then at that time they
 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.499
realized that then at that time they
just thought that they were they'd been

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509
just thought that they were they'd been
 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.330
just thought that they were they'd been
sort of wrenched off by the by the air

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340
sort of wrenched off by the by the air
 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.100
sort of wrenched off by the by the air
and we're just floating around what they

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110
and we're just floating around what they
 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.520
and we're just floating around what they
figured out more recently probably from

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530
figured out more recently probably from
 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.249
figured out more recently probably from
there like 56,000 70s was that the

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259
there like 56,000 70s was that the
 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.140
there like 56,000 70s was that the
insects were actually deliberately

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150
insects were actually deliberately
 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.670
insects were actually deliberately
getting themselves carried away often

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680
getting themselves carried away often
 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.069
getting themselves carried away often
took off and then found air currents and

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:16.079
took off and then found air currents and
 

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:17.720
took off and then found air currents and
then were and then we're also able to

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730
then were and then we're also able to
 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.520
then were and then we're also able to
bring themselves down so even tiny tiny

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530
bring themselves down so even tiny tiny
 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.920
bring themselves down so even tiny tiny
tiny insects that that can't actually on

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930
tiny insects that that can't actually on
 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:22.430
tiny insects that that can't actually on
the

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440
the
 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.380
the
actually fly would get themselves up

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390
actually fly would get themselves up
 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.420
actually fly would get themselves up
into the air and would would take

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430
into the air and would would take
 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:27.710
into the air and would would take
themselves off places where they'd have

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720
themselves off places where they'd have
 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.090
themselves off places where they'd have
no more of the resources that they

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100
no more of the resources that they
 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.440
no more of the resources that they
wanted or just in a place that they

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450
wanted or just in a place that they
 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.810
wanted or just in a place that they
preferred and when they first did these

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820
preferred and when they first did these
 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.180
preferred and when they first did these
studies over Louisiana they found that

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190
studies over Louisiana they found that
 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.060
studies over Louisiana they found that
in as in a square mile I'm like a column

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070
in as in a square mile I'm like a column
 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.940
in as in a square mile I'm like a column
of air square mile there were something

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950
of air square mile there were something
 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.250
of air square mile there were something
like between 25 and 35 million insects

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260
like between 25 and 35 million insects
 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.480
like between 25 and 35 million insects
depending on the time of day in time of

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490
depending on the time of day in time of
 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.430
depending on the time of day in time of
year so it's a huge huge amount and so

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440
year so it's a huge huge amount and so
 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.930
year so it's a huge huge amount and so
often think about that you know when you

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940
often think about that you know when you
 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.580
often think about that you know when you
look out of the window that there's just

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590
look out of the window that there's just
 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:50.870
look out of the window that there's just
full of these things that you can't see

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880
full of these things that you can't see
 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.400
full of these things that you can't see
and that they're all going somewhere and

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410
and that they're all going somewhere and
 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:53.990
and that they're all going somewhere and
that they sort of i think many of they

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000
that they sort of i think many of they
 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.890
that they sort of i think many of they
know where they're going they're going

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900
know where they're going they're going
 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.840
know where they're going they're going
deliberately it's just like this

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850
deliberately it's just like this
 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.900
deliberately it's just like this
completely you know just completely

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910
completely you know just completely
 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:00.830
completely you know just completely
different world that's going on around

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840
different world that's going on around
 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.720
different world that's going on around
us that were almost your most of us they

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730
us that were almost your most of us they
 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.000
us that were almost your most of us they
just unaware of

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010
 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.490
I think what people are surprised about

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500
I think what people are surprised about
 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.740
I think what people are surprised about
is that are the cognitive abilities of

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750
is that are the cognitive abilities of
 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.020
is that are the cognitive abilities of
social insects so people know that they

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030
social insects so people know that they
 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.229
social insects so people know that they
have these these very well people tend

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239
have these these very well people tend
 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:23.050
have these these very well people tend
to think that they have people know they

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060
to think that they have people know they
 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.520
to think that they have people know they
have very developed social organization

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530
have very developed social organization
 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:25.839
have very developed social organization
they tend to think that is very rigid

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:25.849
they tend to think that is very rigid
 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:29.339
they tend to think that is very rigid
and I think that's partly because um

00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:29.349
and I think that's partly because um
 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:31.539
and I think that's partly because um

to think of them as very rigid societies
and that's actually doesn't seem to be

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730
and that's actually doesn't seem to be
 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:05.259

that much balance but but bees are

that much balance but but bees are
actually very flexible so although

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970
actually very flexible so although

like the work worker bees and whatever

00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:17.229
like the work worker bees and whatever

they are very flexible in terms of the

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:19.669
they are very flexible in terms of the
 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:21.430
they are very flexible in terms of the
tasks that they do very adapt is so they

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440
tasks that they do very adapt is so they
 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.320
tasks that they do very adapt is so they
they actually know they'll change like

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330
they actually know they'll change like
 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.089
they actually know they'll change like
like many animals do particular fish and

their physical characteristics depending
 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.610
their physical characteristics depending
on environmental conditions so they're

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:33.620
on environmental conditions so they're
 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.000
on environmental conditions so they're
really very flexible animals and their

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.010
really very flexible animals and their
 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:38.800
really very flexible animals and their
behavior is also quite flexible so

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810
behavior is also quite flexible so
 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.439
behavior is also quite flexible so
there's seems to be something like forty

there's seems to be something like forty
percent of their time which is

percent of their time which is
completely unaccounted for so they'll

they just sort of like hanging out with
