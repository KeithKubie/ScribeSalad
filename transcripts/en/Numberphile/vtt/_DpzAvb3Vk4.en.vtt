MATT PARKER: I'm going to show
you two of my all-time

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:03.310
favorite diagrams.

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:05.480
And it's a way of linking
numbers as they go

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:06.410
from one to the next.

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:09.780
And a lot of people will have
heard of-- or I'm sure you'll

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.250
have a video on this
somewhere--

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.406
about happy numbers.

00:00:12.406 --> 00:00:14.950
DR RIA SYMONDS: 0 squared
equals 1.

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.900
This makes my number
7 a happy number.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.440
MATT PARKER: And I'm not going
to do happy numbers.

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.450
I'm going to do a thing on the
number 145, if that's OK.

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:26.420
And I'll get to that in
my second diagram.

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.325
My first diagram is the
idea of happy numbers.

00:00:32.325 --> 00:00:34.750
So for example, let's do
the happy number--

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:35.700
let's do 13.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.000
You can square both those digits
and add them together.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.700
So if you square 1, you get 1.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.280
If you square 3, you get 9.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.050
And so that will give you 10.

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:44.430
OK?

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.860
And if you repeat
the process--

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.640
you then square 1, you get 1.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.340
You square 0, you get 0.

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:50.980
That will give you 1.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.470
And so 13, through a chain,
ends up at 1.

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:54.740
And there are other
numbers higher up.

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.510
So let's say you had 23.

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.520
And you square 2, you get 4.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:01.790
You square 3, you get 9.

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:02.640
You get 13.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.050
23 will lead into
13, as will 32.

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:08.010
Doesn't matter what
order they're in.

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.120
In fact, over here, we could
have gone in that way via 31.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.220
And what I'm going to do now is
very quickly draw for you

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.060
all the two-digit numbers,
because there are some

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.710
three-digit numbers.

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.382
We could have come into 10.

00:01:19.382 --> 00:01:21.250
130 would work just as well.

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.750
And that will have come in from
97, because if you square

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.490
9 and square 7, add them
together, you get 130.

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.660
Which of course means that 79
will do the same thing.

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.770
And we could have got there from
94, or we could have come

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:32.880
in from 49.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.370
And if we come in from 49, we
could have got there from 70

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.960
or from 7, would give us 49,
because it's just the 7.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.510
And on the other side over
here, we could have

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.770
got to 32 via 44.

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.570
And we actually could have
got to 1 from 100.

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.560
And we could have got
into 100 from--

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.460
86 would have got us to
100, as would have 68.

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.730
The great thing about 68 that's
different to 86 is you

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:58.560
can get there from 28.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.570
Or you can come in from 82.

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.440
And you can get into 82
from either 19 or 91.

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:12.130
And those are all the two-digit
numbers that end up

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:13.650
in this happy tree.

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.610
And I call that process of
squaring both the digits-- or

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.220
all the digits-- and then adding
them "happification."

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.920
So you could call this the
happification tree, and these

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.450
are all the extreme points.

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.430
So actually, that there is
the top of that branch.

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.150
That's the top of that branch.

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.440
That's the top of that
branch, and the rest

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.140
of them feed down.

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.980
And obviously, a lot of the
forks you just get the

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.220
redundant--

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.840
vestigial, I guess-- number
which leads in at the same

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.330
point, because it doesn't
matter on the

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:44.070
order of the digits.

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.700
OK.

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:45.590
BRADY HARAN: Happification
tree.

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.270
MATT PARKER: Happification
tree.

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.860
There you are.

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.310
Now, the diagram I really want
to show you-- the reason I'm

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:51.980
talking about 145--

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.200
is not the happification tree.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.170
We'll do this with 83.

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:57.230
That's probably a good start.

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:58.700
83 is not a happy number.

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.190
And the reason 83 is not a happy
number-- we'll put it

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.290
over here-- is that if you
keep happificating--

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:05.140
bear with me--

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.435
83, you do not end up at 1.

00:03:07.435 --> 00:03:10.550
But where else can you
end up, right?

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:11.120
What happens?

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.300
Square 8 and square 3.

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:13.060
And you add them together.

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.070
You end up with 73, which, as
you will have realized by now,

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.630
could also happen if you
had started at 38.

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.250
So put that in for completeness
sake.

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:22.250
73--

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:27.730
if you now square 7 and square
3, that will give you 58.

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.530
If you square 5, square 8,
that will give you 89.

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.960
If you square 8, square 9,
you'll get the 145 that I was

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.090
mentioning before.

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.040
If you square 1, 4, and 5, and
add all those together, you

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.620
get 42, a rather
popular number.

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.970
If you square those,
you'll get to 20.

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.750
If you go from 20,
you'll get to 4.

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.504
4 goes straight to 16.

00:03:48.504 --> 00:03:52.950
16 will give you 37, and then
37 will give you 58.

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.080
And at this point, we're
back in the loop.

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.720
So now, two things happen.

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.720
When you start with a two-digit
number and start

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.180
squaring and adding the digits,
you either end up down

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.490
here at 1, so you can consider
this like a tree.

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:08.590
So I call this the happification
tree.

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.580
And it all grows out of 1.

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:13.670
Or you end up in this
coil, right?

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.720
And all the other numbers
feed into this coil.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.360
So these are the
happy numbers.

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.760
And I call these the--

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:23.920
melancoiling numbers?

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:25.450
That'll work.

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.170
So you've got the happy
numbers and the

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:28.120
melancoiling numbers.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.470
And because I am the thorough,
fastidious kind of guy, I am

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.500
going to fill in very quickly--
if you don't mind

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:35.860
bearing with me for
a second, Brady--

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.560
I'm going to fill in all the
other melancoiling numbers.

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.510
37 has quite a tree
that comes off it.

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:45.620
You can get to 37 from
either 106--

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:46.660
that is a 6--

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:51.050
which feeds in from 95 and 59.

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:54.205
Or alternatively, you can also
get there via 61, which is

00:04:54.205 --> 00:04:54.920
kind of cool.

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.110
61--

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:02.580
you can get to there from 65,
which gives us 74 and 47,

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.920
which comes off 75 and 57.

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:12.500
Whereas 61 also gives us
56, which leads into--

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.560
OK, 45-- nearly there.

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.600
63, that's 36.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:21.210
And down here, we end up
with 6, and 60, and

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:22.490
there's another end.

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:27.150
This is the map, which consists
of two parts of how

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.280
all the two-digit numbers
link together.

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.920
This is the structure for all
two-digit numbers when you

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:35.160
happificate them, so where you
square all the digits and add

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:35.630
them together.

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:40.280
And you'll notice it requires
a few three-digit numbers to

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:41.350
form the structure.

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:42.120
So there's a three-digit
number.

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:45.640
There's the 145, which the
video is all about.

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:46.530
And there's a few other ones.

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:49.500
There's 113 hiding down here.

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:50.540
Where else does one sneak in?

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:52.790
There's 130 sneaks
in over there.

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:55.130
And they're vital for
the structure.

00:05:55.130 --> 00:06:00.420
All other three-digit or higher
numbers filter into

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:01.370
this diagram.

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:03.990
This is the complete structure
for all the two-digit numbers.

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:05.590
BRADY HARAN: Let's draw the
three-digit one as well, then.

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:05.810
MATT PARKER: OK.

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:07.140
I'll get some-- no!

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:09.680
So you can if you want,
but it doesn't add any

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.800
further detail to this.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:16.210
And what I love is all numbers
of any size will filter down

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:18.100
into one of two situations.

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:19.585
They either filter down to 1.

00:06:19.585 --> 00:06:22.490
Or they will filter down
into the melancoil.

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:23.640
And this is it.

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:26.060
And of course, from here, you
can go absolutely wild.

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:28.460
And I'm going to refrain from
this level of wildness.

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:32.350
But you could look at what
happens when you cube all your

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:33.520
digits, right?

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.470
So if you cube all your digits,

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:37.920
you get more scenarios.

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:40.910
You get some numbers that go--
there are different sizes and

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:41.770
types of coils.

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:45.420
There are different ways
to end up at 1.

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:47.297
Because you always get 1,
because things like 1,000 will

00:06:47.297 --> 00:06:48.710
drop you there.

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:50.380
There are points--

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:51.690
which there's no points here.

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:53.240
It's either 1, or
it's the spiral.

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:56.100
You get points in three
because-- as again, I'm sure

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:58.530
there are other videos about
narcissistic numbers.

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:00.250
DR RIA SYMONDS: It's
the same number.

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:02.210
It's in love with itself.

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:07.500
MATT PARKER: When you hit, let's
say, 371, then 1 cubed

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:11.280
plus 3 cubed plus 7 cubed
gives you 371.

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:12.840
And so you end up stuck.

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:14.810
And things feed into
that point.

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:19.590
And you can do it for powers of
4 or 5, or there's a type

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:21.570
of infinite number
of options there.

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:23.950
And you can do it in
different bases.

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:26.370
Mathematicians get a bit
emotional when we become

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:27.730
base-10-centric.

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:29.545
And there's no reason why
you can't generalize

00:07:29.545 --> 00:07:30.570
this to other bases.

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:31.290
But there you are.

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:36.870
If you limit yourself just to
squaring in base 10, these are

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:38.150
the two diagrams you get.

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:40.470
And so I got bored.

00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:42.400
And I made a quick
spreadsheet.

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:43.290
And I went through.

00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:47.170
And I classified all of this and
drew the diagram myself.

00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:52.310
So this was me, again, bored
in the pub with some mates.

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:55.090
And we went through and
classified all the numbers.

00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:56.372
So there you are.

00:08:00.875 --> 00:08:05.060
I came up with this myself,
but other people very well

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:05.580
could have done this.

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:07.130
I don't want to claim
ownership.

00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:11.110
This somewhat pathetic name of
melancoiling numbers I did

00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:11.610
come up with.

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:14.690
But again, I've seen them
described as not happy numbers

00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:17.110
or unhappy numbers.

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:18.960
But then again, why are they
called happy numbers in the

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:19.310
first place?

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:21.190
What a ridiculous name.

00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:25.250
So this particular
interpretation of the happy

00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:27.730
numbers is of my invention.

00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:30.210
And as always, I gave it a
suitably pathetic name.
