00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:03.530
Coal is dirty.

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:04.540
Nuclear is scary.

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:06.680
Solar and wind aren’t always reliable.

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:09.740
Hydrothermal and hydroelectric aren’t widely
accessible.

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:11.770
And we'll eventually deplete our oil reserves.

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:16.359
Okay, yes, this is all a bit of hyperbole,
but the bottom line is that we don’t have

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:18.169
a perfect source of energy.

00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:19.900
But, there might be hope.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:25.339
Around the world people are working on fusion
energy, which might be the safe, efficient,

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:27.939
reliable, clean energy source that could save
our planet.

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:31.240
Okay, that’s a little bit more hyperbole,
but it would be world-changing.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:38.760
So, how close are we to fusion energy?

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:45.960
This may come as a surprise to some, but fusion
is not some futuristic, sci-fi idea, it’s

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:46.969
real.

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:47.969
It’s happening.

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.220
You’ve seen it.

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:55.579
Fusion energy exists every time we go out
in the day and look at the sun, we see a big

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:01.960
ball of burning hydrogen gas...If you go out
at night and look at the stars, those are

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:09.250
also billions and billions, to quote Carl
Sagan, of burning plasma engines, fusion engines.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.740
We've always followed the stars for direction,
but we need to learn to emulate them

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.310
The twinkle of a star and the heat from our
sun, are byproducts of fusion.

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.670
Fusion is the process of two light atoms,
like hydrogen, being forced together due to

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.530
immense heat and pressure to form a heavier
atom, like helium.

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.509
When this merger happens, energy is released,
which creates heat and light.

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:35.090
Fusion is the energy that makes life possible
on our planet.

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:42.310
And many think fusion will power our cities
of the future.

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.799
We're burning things, which has got to stop.

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:47.840
We just literally set fire to things.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.920
That is really how we power cities at the
moment.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:51.920
It's very inefficient.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.229
It's very dirty, and it's not doing our atmosphere
any good.

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.369
And our atmosphere is one of the main reasons
people are excited about fusion.

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.750
Unlike fossil fuels, Nuclear fusion doesn’t
release toxins and polluting greenhouse gasses

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.409
like carbon dioxide.

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:10.679
The byproduct of fusion is helium, an inert,
non toxic gas.

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.569
The fuel is made of two hydrogen atoms that
can be pulled from our abundant supply of

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:16.569
seawater.

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:21.900
And yes, fusion does produce radioactive byproducts,
but the half-life of that waste is much shorter

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.580
than in a fission reactor.

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.250
It’s for all these reasons and more that
Nuclear Fusion is viewed by many to be the

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.159
cleanest, greenest and most viable alternative
to fossil fuels that we have.

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:38.920
In fact, one of the biggest advantages touted
by fusion supporters is that power plants

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.220
might be able to plug right into our existing
electrical grid, meaning we don’t have to

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:49.319
reinvent the wheel when it comes to energy
infrastructure.

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:58.050
Essentially the basic premise of fusion is
to take the sun, a shining ball of hydrogen

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:03.660
in the sky, and to bring it to Earth and use
the heat it produces to generate steam, and

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.629
to use that steam to turn a turbine.

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:10.700
Now, of course we can’t grab a star and
transport it to Earth, but we can replicate

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.470
the conditions of a star.

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:13.489
And we have.

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:18.269
We currently have the technology to heat up
hydrogen atoms to well beyond the temperature

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:21.010
of the sun, to a point where fusion can occur.

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:26.470
We have the technology to keep that superheated
plasma in place long enough for fusion to

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:27.470
occur.

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.819
We know we can turn heat into electricity
and currently have the infrastructure to put

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:33.780
that electricity onto the grid.

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.250
So, why can’t I charge my phone with electricity
made by fusion?

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:39.980
Well, it all comes down to Q.

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.370
In the world of fusion, Q represents “energy
gain.”

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:49.519
Basically, power plants of all kinds need
electricity to produce, well, electricity.

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:57.129
This is only worthwhile if you make more electricity
than you consume.

00:03:57.129 --> 00:03:58.410
No one has done that yet.

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:04.180
That isn’t to say people haven’t made
fusion reactions happen, because they do.

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:09.370
They do more and more every year and we have
more and more knowledge of how this works

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.360
every year...But that first step hasn’t
happened yet, more out than you put in.

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:18.720
It seems like right now the marker for success
is a reactor that produces ten times more

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.350
energy than it’s putting in.

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:25.500
That’s the goal for ITER, the largest scale
fusion experiment on the planet that’s been

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:26.890
in the works for decades.

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:34.920
ITER represents a collaboration of something
like 30 nations on Earth to contribute to

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:42.110
building a tokamak and demonstrating an energy
gain, a capital Q of ten.

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:47.350
This is exciting, and many think the science
is already proven out, meaning that when it

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:52.660
turns out in 2025, it will meet or exceed
its goal.

00:04:52.660 --> 00:05:00.030
But, ITER is experiment only to demonstrate
that fusion can produce a net energy gain.

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:04.830
As big and expensive as it is, will not power
anyone's home.

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:09.700
If it’s successful, than a power station
called DEMO will be built, aiming to put fusion

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:13.710
electricity onto the grid somewhere between
2030 and 2050.

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:15.890
Or, maybe even a little after that.

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:21.180
Which is one of the complaints about the world
of fusion so far; it takes time.

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:28.600
So, one of the major issues with working in
government projects is that they are notoriously

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:33.680
bureaucratic....We're building parts all over
the world, I mean, it is the perfect storm

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:39.390
for a delayed project, an over-funded, over-budgeted
delayed project.

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:42.750
Government projects aren’t the only way
to achieve fusion.

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:45.620
Private companies are also getting in on the
world of fusion and they’re not waiting

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.930
around for ITER to prove successful.

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:52.800
For example MIT, helped by Professor Hartwig,
recently teamed up with a private company

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:57.120
on a plan that they think could lead to an
operational fusion power plant within the

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.270
next 15 years.

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:03.690
But it’s not just money that is key to fusion
success, it’s awareness.

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:07.960
The more vocal the public is about wanting
fusion power plants the more governments and

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.560
investors might take notice.

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:16.160
As every politician knows, the public plays
the only role in this.

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:22.930
And I think this is an important issue...Do
people trust whoever is building this in a

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:28.340
way that they will accept this as a part of
their everyday life?

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:33.330
So, for nuclear fusion to happen, it might
take you.

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:37.600
It might take you to read about it, learn
about it, talk about it, watch videos about

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:38.600
it.

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:42.280
There are fusion experiments currently being
carried out all over the world and the computer

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:45.690
models have already proved that the science
works.

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:50.270
People want it, governments wants it, private
industry wants it and well...the environment

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:51.270
wants it.

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:56.970
It just needs to be tested, built, made scalable,
approved and installed.

00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:00.070
So, how close are we to fusion energy?

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:04.730
Well, the world that we would have fusion
energy is clearly a future world.

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:09.750
It's 30, 50 years where it's a dominant form
of energy if everything goes right.

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:12.430
Fusion is the only candidate we have.

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:13.560
It's what the stars are doing.

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:18.200
It's what the universe is telling us to do,
as the right way to create energy.

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:21.060
It's not, do you think it's the right way
or not?

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:23.360
It's coming for sure.

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:29.120
Thanks for watching everyone. If you want to know how close we are

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:33.160
to resurrecting the mammoth, curing AIDS, or taking pictures of blackholes,

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:34.640
you can do that right here.

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:36.440
Now thanks again for watching Seeker. We'll see you next time.
