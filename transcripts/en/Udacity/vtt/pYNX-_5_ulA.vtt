00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:05.530
So time for another reflection. For this reflection, I want you to go out. And

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:07.310
find an example, where you got stuck

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:10.350
crossing either the gulf of execution, or the

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:13.000
gulf of evaluation. And you can share

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.860
your example, via whatever format you'd like. So

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:19.660
photos, video, text. As long as your example

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.730
clearly communicates, where you got stuck and why.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.490
&gt;&gt; So, here's a tip while you're going

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.150
out in the world, and looking for difficult situations.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.790
Look for a place where somebody has applied, maybe a

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:34.223
hand-made label. That gives additional instructions on how to do

00:00:34.223 --> 00:00:38.510
something. This is often a, users call for help. This

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.690
wasn't designed right. I need extra help. So maybe there's

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.060
a Post-it note on something, that gives some additional explanation.

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.150
It might also be an official sign. So here's a

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:51.250
few examples. One, well this door is an emergency exit.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.350
But it actually isn't clear that it's an emergency exit.

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.990
So somebody had to hand make a sign, that said don't

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:59.040
go out this door. Or the alarm will sound. Well, then

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.870
people might actually be confused. because if there was an emergency,

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.129
they wouldn't know whether they can go out that door or

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.100
not. And look at this coffee maker. Well for some reason,

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.760
and maybe it's a cultural constraint here. Is that red means

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.690
on. No sorry, I got that wrong. Red actually means off.

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.190
Boy, that's confusing. So they added a handmade label here, that said.

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.750
The red light when it's on, means the coffee machine is off.
