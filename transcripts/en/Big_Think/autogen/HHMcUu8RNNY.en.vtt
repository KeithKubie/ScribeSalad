and the answer always was no really

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850
and the answer always was no really
 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:40.340
and the answer always was no really
until recent decades not not as recent

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350
until recent decades not not as recent
 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.190
until recent decades not not as recent
as two but recent decades yeah the

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200
as two but recent decades yeah the
 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.699
as two but recent decades yeah the
answer was really no and so I I think

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709
answer was really no and so I I think
 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:49.309
answer was really no and so I I think
more people with education and
