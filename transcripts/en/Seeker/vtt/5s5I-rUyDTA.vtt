00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:05.240
Consciousness is defined as the state of being
awake and aware of one's surroundings, it’s

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.509
the mind’s understanding that it exists.

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:10.950
And it is one of the most elusive phenomena
in all of human understanding.

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.710
To try and shed light on this mystery, scientists
are searching for a biological explanation

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.490
they call the neural correlates of consciousness.

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.960
Which means, the parts of your brain that
supposedly generate self-awareness.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.869
Aaaaand …. they might have found a key component!

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:31.780
Researchers at the Allen Institute for Brain
Science uncovered three giant neurons, one

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:36.770
of which is projected across the cortex of
a mouse brain like a “crown of thorns!”

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:41.610
They’ve traced these special neurons to
what’s believed to be one of the most densely

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.850
connected parts of the brain.. called the
claustrum.

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.809
Scientists have hypothesized that the claustrum
could be coordinating inputs and outputs to

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:54.630
create conscious experiences … so seeing
these three giant neurons extend from the

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:56.399
claustrum was a big deal.

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.399
The claustrum is a tiny sheet of neurons just
below the cortex, and there’s one on each

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:02.440
hemisphere of the brain.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.110
Scientists suspect the claustrum is a highly
integrated region, and could have more anatomical

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.260
connections than any other part of our brain.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.320
It’s potentially connected to many cortical
areas that are crucial for perception, like

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.790
vision, movement and hearing.

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.530
When studying the region, famous neuroscientist
Francis Crick, (yes, one of the guys that

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.960
discovered the structure of DNA) proposed
that subjective consciousness is possible

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.270
thanks to the claustrum, which could be acting
like some kind of "conductor" in the mind.

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:33.220
For instance, if your brain were an orchestra,
he suspected the claustrum is responsible

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:38.810
for keeping the myriad pieces and instruments
playing together…

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.880
Crick explained this orchestration concept
best when he described the experience of picking

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:43.880
a rose.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.660
You can hold the rose in your hands, smell
its fragrance, see its red petals … and

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.399
your mind processes this as a unified, subjective
experience.

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:55.579
The thing is, the claustrum conductor is just
a hypothesis.

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:58.299
But there was one recent study that gave brain
scientists pause.

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:03.009
In 2014, a study was published detailing a
woman with epileptic seizures who underwent

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:04.560
deep brain stimulation.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:10.770
When electrodes near her left claustrum were
stimulated, she immediately stopped what she

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:16.510
was doing and stared blankly into space, she
didn’t even respond to calls or gestures.

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.290
When they turned off the treatment, she regained
consciousness and didn’t even remember what

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:22.290
happened!

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.980
It was almost like they discovered an on-and
off switch deep inside her brain! (wtf!!!!)

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.700
The claustrum could be the key to figuring
this all out, but we don’t know for sure

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.819
… consciousness is still the ultimate enigma.

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:37.730
Looking for connections in the brain also
isn't enough to explain whether consciousness

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.040
is actually present.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.950
It’s more complicated that that.

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.960
Some of the brightest minds in physics think
that consciousness is something the brain

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:48.959
can’t ever solve, but we’ll leave that
for the philosophers and scientists to fight

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:49.959
over.

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:50.959

Now there’s a lot we still need to learn
about the brain but one of my burning questions

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.040
is...could we survive with only half of one?

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.541
Julian has more on this here.
