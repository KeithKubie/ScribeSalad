00:00:01.298 --> 00:00:04.723
- [Voiceover] Let's
multiply four times 80.

00:00:04.723 --> 00:00:06.278
So we can look at this a few ways.

00:00:06.278 --> 00:00:11.062
One way is to say four
times, we have the number 80.

00:00:11.062 --> 00:00:14.301
So we have the number 80 one time,

00:00:14.301 --> 00:00:15.134
two times,

00:00:16.112 --> 00:00:17.112
three times,

00:00:18.004 --> 00:00:19.328
four times.

00:00:19.328 --> 00:00:22.660
Four times we have the number 80.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.446
And we could do this
computation, add all of these,

00:00:25.446 --> 00:00:27.780
and get our solution.

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.011
But let's look at it another way.

00:00:29.011 --> 00:00:32.053
Let's try to stick with multiplication.

00:00:32.053 --> 00:00:36.337
And one way we can do that
is to break up this 80.

00:00:36.337 --> 00:00:38.960
We know a pattern for multiplying by 10,

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.745
so let's try to break
up this 80 to get a 10.

00:00:42.745 --> 00:00:46.412
So if we have four
times, and instead of 80,

00:00:48.202 --> 00:00:50.285
let's say eight times 10.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.928
Because 80 and eight times 10 are equal;

00:00:55.928 --> 00:00:57.043
those are equivalent;

00:00:57.043 --> 00:01:00.793
so we can replace our
80 with eight times 10.

00:01:01.768 --> 00:01:03.614
And then we have this times 10 back here

00:01:03.614 --> 00:01:06.319
which is super helpful 'cause
there's a nice neat pattern

00:01:06.319 --> 00:01:10.475
in math that we can use to
help us with the times 10 part.

00:01:10.475 --> 00:01:11.752
So let's start to solve this.

00:01:11.752 --> 00:01:13.669
Four times eight is 32.

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.267
And then we still have 32 times 10.

00:01:20.263 --> 00:01:24.001
And then we can use our
pattern for multiplying by 10,

00:01:24.001 --> 00:01:27.948
which is that anytime we
multiply a whole number times 10

00:01:27.948 --> 00:01:31.524
we take that whole
number, in this case 32,

00:01:31.524 --> 00:01:34.113
and we add a zero to the end.

00:01:34.113 --> 00:01:35.946
So 32 times 10 is 320.

00:01:39.175 --> 00:01:41.033
And there's a reason that pattern works;

00:01:41.033 --> 00:01:42.554
we went into it in another video,

00:01:42.554 --> 00:01:44.365
but here just real quickly,

00:01:44.365 --> 00:01:46.282
32 times 10 is 32 tens.

00:01:48.974 --> 00:01:50.588
And we can do a few examples.

00:01:50.588 --> 00:01:53.171
If we had, say, three times 10,

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.308
that would be three tens,
or a 10 plus another 10

00:01:58.308 --> 00:02:01.058
plus another 10, which equals 30:

00:02:02.372 --> 00:02:06.354
our whole number with a zero on the end.

00:02:06.354 --> 00:02:09.199
If we had something like 12 times 10,

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:11.463
well, that would be 12 tens.

00:02:11.463 --> 00:02:15.004
And if we listed out 10 12
times and counted 'em up,

00:02:15.004 --> 00:02:19.323
there would be 120, it
would add up to 120,

00:02:19.323 --> 00:02:22.539
which again is our whole
number with a zero on the end,

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:24.956
or 12 with a zero on the end.

00:02:25.836 --> 00:02:29.737
So we can use that pattern
here to see that 32 times 10

00:02:29.737 --> 00:02:32.154
is 32 with a zero on the end.

00:02:34.764 --> 00:02:35.820
Let's try another one.

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.408
Let's do something like,
let's say 300 this time,

00:02:39.408 --> 00:02:43.158
we'll do hundreds instead
of tens, times six.

00:02:44.586 --> 00:02:49.288
300 we can break up, like we
did with 80 in the last one,

00:02:49.288 --> 00:02:52.871
and we can say that
300 is 100 three times,

00:02:54.164 --> 00:02:56.474
or 100 times three.

00:02:56.474 --> 00:03:00.474
And then we still have
our times six after that.

00:03:01.618 --> 00:03:03.871
So these two expressions,

00:03:03.871 --> 00:03:07.985
300 times six and 100
times three times six,

00:03:07.985 --> 00:03:12.235
are equivalent 'cause we
replaced our 300 with a 100.

00:03:12.235 --> 00:03:14.742
And then from here we can multiply.

00:03:14.742 --> 00:03:16.670
And let's start with
our one-digit numbers.

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.527
Let's multiply those first.

00:03:18.527 --> 00:03:20.360
Three times six is 18.

00:03:21.813 --> 00:03:24.813
And then we still have 18 times 100,

00:03:26.181 --> 00:03:27.431
or 18 hundreds,

00:03:28.444 --> 00:03:30.694
so we can write that as 18,

00:03:33.216 --> 00:03:37.383
and then to show hundreds
we'll put two zeros on the end,

00:03:38.556 --> 00:03:39.389
or 1800.

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:45.497
Just like up here, just
like we saw that 300

00:03:48.494 --> 00:03:50.827
is equal to three times 100,

00:03:51.977 --> 00:03:55.227
or our three with two zeros on the end,

00:03:56.842 --> 00:03:58.072
same thing here.

00:03:58.072 --> 00:04:01.822
18 times 100 is 18 with
two zeros on the end,

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:03.920
or 18 hundreds.

00:04:05.213 --> 00:04:07.630
So 300 times six equals 1800.

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:13.398
Let's try another one,
but this time let's go

00:04:13.398 --> 00:04:16.405
even another place
value and try thousands.

00:04:16.405 --> 00:04:19.155
Something like seven times 7,000.

00:04:23.104 --> 00:04:24.624
So like in the previous ones

00:04:24.624 --> 00:04:27.167
we're gonna break up our thousands.

00:04:27.167 --> 00:04:30.417
7,000 is the same as seven times 1,000.

00:04:33.286 --> 00:04:35.503
1,000 seven times.

00:04:35.503 --> 00:04:37.802
And we still have our times seven

00:04:37.802 --> 00:04:40.391
in the front here to bring down.

00:04:40.391 --> 00:04:43.560
And again, we can multiply
our single digits first,

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:44.663
our one-digit numbers.

00:04:44.663 --> 00:04:46.663
Seven times seven is 49.

00:04:48.622 --> 00:04:52.455
And then 49 times 1,000
is going to be 49,000,

00:04:55.077 --> 00:04:57.632
which we can write as 49,

00:04:57.632 --> 00:05:00.430
and this time, maybe the
pattern's becoming clear,

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.193
we're going to have
three zeros on the end,

00:05:03.193 --> 00:05:06.943
so it'll be a 49 with
three zeros, or 49,000.

00:05:10.101 --> 00:05:13.479
Just like up here, seven times 1,000

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:16.057
was a seven with three zeros,

00:05:16.057 --> 00:05:20.224
49 times 1,000 is a 49 with
three zeros, or 49,000.

00:05:22.361 --> 00:05:24.479
Let's look at this as a pattern.

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:25.838
If we show this as a pattern,

00:05:25.838 --> 00:05:29.005
let's do something like nine times 50.

00:05:32.862 --> 00:05:36.862
And then in another one
let's do nine times 500.

00:05:39.363 --> 00:05:43.030
And one last one we can
do nine times 5,000.

00:05:46.291 --> 00:05:48.184
I encourage you to pause here

00:05:48.184 --> 00:05:49.496
and see if you can work these out.

00:05:49.496 --> 00:05:51.377
See if you can come up with solutions

00:05:51.377 --> 00:05:53.710
for these three expressions.

00:05:55.208 --> 00:05:57.507
Now we can work them out together.

00:05:57.507 --> 00:05:58.590
Nine times 50

00:06:00.398 --> 00:06:04.148
will be the same as nine
times five times 10,

00:06:06.969 --> 00:06:10.963
'cause we broke up our
50 into a five times 10.

00:06:10.963 --> 00:06:13.505
And then if we multiply across,

00:06:13.505 --> 00:06:15.338
nine times five is 45,

00:06:17.278 --> 00:06:19.914
and to the end we're
going to add one zero.

00:06:19.914 --> 00:06:23.443
The pattern for times
10 is to add one zero.

00:06:23.443 --> 00:06:25.382
We can keep going here.

00:06:25.382 --> 00:06:29.549
Nine times 500 will be nine,
and then times five times 100.

00:06:32.882 --> 00:06:36.965
500 is five hundreds, just
like 50 was five tens.

00:06:38.827 --> 00:06:42.994
Multiplying across, nine
times five still equals 45,

00:06:43.877 --> 00:06:47.794
but this time we will
add two zeros to the end,

00:06:49.307 --> 00:06:50.140
or 4500.

00:06:52.465 --> 00:06:54.857
And finally, nine times 5,000 will be

00:06:54.857 --> 00:06:57.190
nine times five times 1,000;

00:07:00.615 --> 00:07:03.282
because 5,000 is five thousands,

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:06.177
or 1,000 five times.

00:07:07.726 --> 00:07:10.726
Working across, nine times five, 45.

00:07:12.324 --> 00:07:15.074
And this time we add three zeros,

00:07:16.558 --> 00:07:17.391
so 45,000.

00:07:20.842 --> 00:07:23.896
So when we multiply each
of these expressions

00:07:23.896 --> 00:07:26.438
we can see the only thing that changed

00:07:26.438 --> 00:07:29.736
was the number of zeros on the end.

00:07:29.736 --> 00:07:33.915
So the pattern: anytime we
multiply a whole number times 10

00:07:33.915 --> 00:07:36.841
we add one zero to the end of our number;

00:07:36.841 --> 00:07:39.302
anytime we multiply a
whole number times 100

00:07:39.302 --> 00:07:41.102
we'll have two zeros;

00:07:41.102 --> 00:07:45.130
and times 1,000 we'll have three zeros.

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:48.207
And once we know that pattern,
we can use it to help us

00:07:48.207 --> 00:07:51.411
with questions like this
where initially we don't see

00:07:51.411 --> 00:07:55.278
a 10; a 100; or a 1,000;
but we can get one;

00:07:55.278 --> 00:07:58.157
we can break up or decompose these numbers

00:07:58.157 --> 00:08:02.324
to get a 10 or 100 or 1,000
to help us solve the problem.
