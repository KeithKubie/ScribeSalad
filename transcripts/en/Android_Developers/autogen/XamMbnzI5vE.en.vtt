00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:02.310
 In Android Studio 2.2 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.050
 We have improved the Visual Layout Editor 

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:07.760
 Includes built-in support for ConstraintLayout 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.480
 ConstraintLayout is a good new way 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.880
 Used to define complex layouts 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.150
 Without nested view hierarchies 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.320
 Thanks to this flexible restraint system 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.450
 You can download it in the Support Repository 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.780
 Can be used in API level 9 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.350
 To install it in Android Studio, please open the SDK Manager. 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.060
 Please click on Android's ConstraintLayout 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.790
 And the SolverintLayout of Solver 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:31.990
 In the SDK toolbar 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:34.590
 To use it in your project, please add a variable 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.360
 And build a gradle 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.330
 Now create a new layout file using ConstraintLayout 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:40.690
 As root view 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.050
 Please note that in Android Studio 2.2 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.600
 Layout Editor has some new features 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.310
 Such as blueprint mode 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:50.760
 You can use it with the design view 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.430
 On the right hand side of the screen 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.960
 You can see the redesigned view detector 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.210
 You can use common view properties 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.520
 And switching between full lists 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.410
 The detector also includes ConstraintLayout 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.730
 Unique layout property editor I will show you later 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.930
 First let's take an image view 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.670
 Drag from the palette to the blueprint 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.550
 You can see every view in the ConstraintLayout 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.990
 There are four empty keys on the side -- top right, bottom left 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.700
 a view inherited from a text view 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.070
 There are also baseline controls 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.560
 Location views are related to each other 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.450
 You can click and control the same type 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.550
 Transfer from one place to another 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.950
 Here I put the text view in the layout 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.360
 Align it with the right end of the image view 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.590
 By setting the limit box on the left 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.600
 I also align these views vertically 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.210
 By adding a limit box at the top 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.430
 The distance of these views is still too close 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.770
 You can adjust the margins by moving the limit box in the design preview. 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.280
 Or I can use the property window on the right 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.980
 This looks better. 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.770
 The rest to be done 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.900
 Is to place our view in the main limit box 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.314
 By launching the Show Constraint Settings in the toolbar 

00:02:01.314 --> 00:02:02.730
 I can see it now 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:06.540
 No limit box points to the edge of the layout 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.160
 My two views have moved 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.830
 Zero position at runtime 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.250
 Associate the top and left controls of the main margin 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.110
 I can set how I want to 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.150
 Put the view in the limit box 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.800
 If I want to center a view 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.890
 Instead of being placed at the left or right end of the screen 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.680
 I can create a new text view and center it horizontally 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.610
 By associating both sides with the main margin 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.830
 You can see the two sides of this view now 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.210
 Have a limit box 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.850
 Because ConstraintLayout cannot satisfy both limit boxes at the same time 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.090
 The view is centered 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.380
 If you look at the properties window now 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.250
 You can see a slider called Horizontal Bias 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.890
 Change the percentage value by the slider 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.290
 I can influence the strength and weight of each limit box. 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.460
 This can move the view slightly to the left or right 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:57.300
 You can also change the width and height of the view. 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.110
 Through three modes -- the fixed size of the package content 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.000
 And meet the limit box 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.700
 You should not use the main margin in ConstraintLayout 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.680
 Instead, use the Compliance box. 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.990
 This means that the view can 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:12.120
 Make the most of space 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.700
 Still meet the limit 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.710
 To remove restrictions 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:19.860
 Click on the small box in the properties window 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.370
 Or click on the control in the design view 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.280
 You can click here to remove all the restriction boxes in a view. 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.790
 Or remove all restriction boxes 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.770
 And layout by using the buttons in the toolbar 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:35.130
 We are constantly improving runtime performance 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.100
 And the function of the editor 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.010
 To make sure you have the latest version of the SDK Manager 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.720
 And your build file 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.610
 Please check out our code lab 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.680
 And articles on "Medium" to learn more about the advanced case of ConstraintLayout 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:50.310
 Thank you for watching.
