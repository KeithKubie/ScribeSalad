the scariest risk I think that we are

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:05.720
the scariest risk I think that we are
 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:11.379
the scariest risk I think that we are
running is if we are wrong about how

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:11.389
running is if we are wrong about how
 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:16.000
running is if we are wrong about how
much time we have to deal with co2 or if

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:16.010
much time we have to deal with co2 or if
 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.490
much time we have to deal with co2 or if
we had a precipitant event that kind of

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:20.500
we had a precipitant event that kind of
 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.769
we had a precipitant event that kind of

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:23.779
dire warner's of climate you know always

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:25.220
say well we'll have the tipping point
 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.249
say well we'll have the tipping point
well you know we could have the tipping

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:27.259
well you know we could have the tipping
 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:29.769
well you know we could have the tipping
point and if we had something like a big

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:29.779
point and if we had something like a big
 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:31.870

hunk of the Greenland ice shall fall off

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:31.880
hunk of the Greenland ice shall fall off
 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.860
hunk of the Greenland ice shall fall off
for example or accelerated release of

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:35.870
for example or accelerated release of
 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.069
for example or accelerated release of
methane from the tundra and the Arctic

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:39.079
methane from the tundra and the Arctic
 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:41.200
methane from the tundra and the Arctic
because of course that's straight co2

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.210
because of course that's straight co2
 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.840
because of course that's straight co2
emissions and methane remember is much

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850
emissions and methane remember is much
 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.119
emissions and methane remember is much
more dangerous than co2 in terms of its

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:46.129
more dangerous than co2 in terms of its
 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:50.020
more dangerous than co2 in terms of its
contribution to climate change so if we

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030
contribution to climate change so if we
 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.810

to accelerate faster than the IPCC says

00:00:56.349 --> 00:00:56.359
to accelerate faster than the IPCC says
 

00:00:56.359 --> 00:00:59.470
to accelerate faster than the IPCC says
you know what what if we can't find not

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480
you know what what if we can't find not
 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.779
you know what what if we can't find not
only that we can't live at 450 parts per

00:01:01.779 --> 00:01:01.789
only that we can't live at 450 parts per
 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:04.270
only that we can't live at 450 parts per
million btus what if we find we can't

million btus what if we find we can't
 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.539
million btus what if we find we can't
live at 350 or 300 that would be my

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:07.549
live at 350 or 300 that would be my
 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:10.149
live at 350 or 300 that would be my
scariest scenario because then I think

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159
scariest scenario because then I think
 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:12.249
scariest scenario because then I think
on the other hand that might be what we

00:01:12.249 --> 00:01:12.259
on the other hand that might be what we
 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:13.870
on the other hand that might be what we
need to galvanize the world that

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880
need to galvanize the world that
 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.320
need to galvanize the world that
business as usual cannot continue and

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330
business as usual cannot continue and
 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.990
business as usual cannot continue and
maybe everybody would come together my

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000
maybe everybody would come together my
 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.249
maybe everybody would come together my
other my other great fear would be that

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:23.259
other my other great fear would be that
 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:26.980
other my other great fear would be that
we is far less catastrophic in the long

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990
we is far less catastrophic in the long
 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:28.660
we is far less catastrophic in the long
run for the future of the globe but my

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670
run for the future of the globe but my
 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.270
run for the future of the globe but my
other concern would be if we had a

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280
other concern would be if we had a
 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.399
other concern would be if we had a
catastrophic war in the Middle East and

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409
catastrophic war in the Middle East and
 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:37.300
catastrophic war in the Middle East and
there was a major disruption to to

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310
there was a major disruption to to
 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.370
there was a major disruption to to
petroleum supplies because that would

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380
petroleum supplies because that would
 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.950
petroleum supplies because that would
send the price of oil up probably if it

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960
send the price of oil up probably if it
 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.179
send the price of oil up probably if it
were to happen you know while we're

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189
were to happen you know while we're
 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:45.340
were to happen you know while we're
still in a global recession probably

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350
still in a global recession probably
 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.800
still in a global recession probably
send us into depression we win then have

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810
send us into depression we win then have
 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.510
send us into depression we win then have
the resources we need to make the

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520
the resources we need to make the
 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:50.920
the resources we need to make the
conversion to the renewable energy

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930
conversion to the renewable energy
 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.740
conversion to the renewable energy
future and that would that would also

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750
future and that would that would also
 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.470
future and that would that would also
have very severe implications

00:01:58.470 --> 00:01:58.480
 
 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.320
 
the only way I ranked out a high risk is

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330
the only way I ranked out a high risk is
 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.940
the only way I ranked out a high risk is
if we were to have an Israeli attack on

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950
if we were to have an Israeli attack on
 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.810
if we were to have an Israeli attack on
Iran or an Iranian attack on Israel

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:09.820
Iran or an Iranian attack on Israel
 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.540
Iran or an Iranian attack on Israel
seems less likely but I think in that

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550
seems less likely but I think in that
 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.550
seems less likely but I think in that
case everybody would immediately become

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560
case everybody would immediately become
 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.280
case everybody would immediately become
polarized the United States would be in

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290
polarized the United States would be in
 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.110
polarized the United States would be in
a very difficult position with our

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120
a very difficult position with our
 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.020
a very difficult position with our
historic Israeli ally on the one hand

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030
historic Israeli ally on the one hand
 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.610
historic Israeli ally on the one hand
but probably the entire Arab world

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620
but probably the entire Arab world
 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.140
but probably the entire Arab world
united against us if not formally at

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150
united against us if not formally at
 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.810
united against us if not formally at
least de facto for their own political

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820
least de facto for their own political
 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.720
least de facto for their own political
survival and that that would be a very

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730
survival and that that would be a very
 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.200
survival and that that would be a very
very serious situation and one that I am

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210
very serious situation and one that I am
 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.810
very serious situation and one that I am
increasingly worried about might occur

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820
increasingly worried about might occur
 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.930
increasingly worried about might occur
because I think largely because of the

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940
because I think largely because of the
 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.630
because I think largely because of the
intransigence of the Iranians on their

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640
intransigence of the Iranians on their
 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.790
intransigence of the Iranians on their
nuclear program I do not believe they're

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800
nuclear program I do not believe they're
 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.070
nuclear program I do not believe they're
negotiating in good faith and I do

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080
negotiating in good faith and I do
 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.960
negotiating in good faith and I do
believe whether you agree with it or not

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970
believe whether you agree with it or not
 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.770
believe whether you agree with it or not
I do believe that Israel sees Iranian

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780
I do believe that Israel sees Iranian
 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.380
I do believe that Israel sees Iranian
nuclear armed Iran has an existential

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390
nuclear armed Iran has an existential
 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.200
nuclear armed Iran has an existential
threat and given the current complexion

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:01.210
threat and given the current complexion
 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:02.850
threat and given the current complexion
of the Israeli government on the more

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860
of the Israeli government on the more
 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.460
of the Israeli government on the more
hardline right wing side of the spectrum

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470
hardline right wing side of the spectrum
 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.850
hardline right wing side of the spectrum
I would not rule it out
