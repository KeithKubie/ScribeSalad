00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.270
- [Instructor] In a previous video,

00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:03.500
we took a look at the labor markets,

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.770
and we thought about it in the
context of the entire market

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:09.580
and how it might impact a firm.

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.190
So let's say that all of a sudden,

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.050
the nation's immigration policy changes

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:19.020
where they're willing to
bring in a lot more folks

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.950
who have the skills
necessary to participate

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.410
in the labor market that
we are studying right now.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.620
So when that immigration opens up

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.300
and more people immigrate
into the country,

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.410
what is going to happen
in this labor market?

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.630
Pause this video, and also think about

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.810
what is going to be the new
equilibrium quantity of labor

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:43.800
and our new equilibrium wage?

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.823
And how might that affect
this particular firm?

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:49.600
All right, now let's do this together.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.980
So if all of a sudden, you
have a lot of immigration,

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.800
new folks who can participate
in this labor market,

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.410
well, that's going to increase
the supply at a given wage.

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.430
So if this is the market
labor supply curve,

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.450
let's call that sub one,

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:07.570
it's going to shift to the right.

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.470
At a given wage, you're
going to have more labor,

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.970
so it's going to be like this.

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.610
So this is the market labor

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.750
supply curve two.

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.010
Now what does that do
to the equilibrium wage

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:30.110
and the quantity of labor?

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.720
Well, our new equilibrium
wage is going to be lower.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.430
Could put it right over there,
I'll call that W sub two,

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:38.570
with a little star there.

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.850
And then we have a higher
equilibrium quantity of labor.

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.860
So Q sub two, I'll put
a star right over there.

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.810
Now what happens for this firm?

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.900
Well, our equilibrium wage
in the market has gone down.

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.920
And we assume that this firm,

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.790
it is a perfectly
competitive labor market,

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.330
so this firm is just going to pay

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.480
whatever the market wage is.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.040
And so the marginal factor cost

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.820
for the firm has now shifted down.

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.130
It is now, this is
marginal factor cost one.

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.570
Now this is marginal factor cost two.

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.990
And now it is actually rational

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.960
for the firm to produce more.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.260
So this is sub one,

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.320
and let's call this
quantity of labor sub two.

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.160
And so what are other things

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.350
that might shift the supply
curve for labor to the right?

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.690
We just talked about
immigration into a country.

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.650
You could also imagine more people

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.610
that are already in the
country being willing

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.800
or being able to participate
in that labor market.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.690
For example, in the second
half of the 20th century,

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.160
it became more acceptable for women

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.810
to participate in the labor force.

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.820
And so something like
that where all of a sudden

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.610
you have all of these women
entering into the labor force

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.330
or into the labor market
for a given market,

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.340
well, that could also shift
the curve to the right.

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.020
Now let's think about the other way.

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:01.430
Let's imagine that you have
net migration out of a country.

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.590
What would happen to the
market labor supply curve?

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:05.900
Well, in that situation,

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.810
we would shift to the left like this.

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.320
At a given wage,

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.880
there would be fewer people
that are willing to work.

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.070
So this is the market labor

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:20.290
supply curve.

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.330
I will call that sub three.

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:23.750
There's other things that could cause it.

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.550
Maybe people's preferences change.

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:27.870
And in this particular labor market,

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.110
people aren't willing
to work there as much.

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.970
Maybe social norms change
where it's just not cool

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.900
to work in that labor market.

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.210
Maybe there's another labor
market in another industry

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:40.340
that all of a sudden is paying better.

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.260
In that situation, fewer
people would be willing

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:43.980
to work in this labor market.

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.910
And so when you shift to
the left, your market wages

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:53.980
go up, so W sub three, just like that.

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.240
The quantity of labor

00:03:57.392 --> 00:04:00.740
is going to go down, Q sub three.

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:01.880
And then as we see,

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.610
if we look at how it
impacts a particular firm,

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:06.910
in a perfectly competitive labor market,

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:09.490
this would be the marginal factor cost

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:11.480
for a firm that's
participating in that market.

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.310
So this is MFC sub three.

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.890
And then now the quantity of labor

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:21.240
that this firm would
hire is going to go down.

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:23.560
So quantity that the
firm hires, sub three,

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.980
put a star over there,
and it has gone down.

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:28.390
So hopefully what we just went through

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:30.210
isn't too much of a surprise for you.

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.720
As you see, labor markets
behave very similarly

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.970
to the markets for many other things.

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.390
If more labor enters into a market,

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:41.440
well, it's gonna shift the
supply of labor to the right.

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.120
And if more labor leaves the market

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.020
or doesn't want to be in that market,

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.300
it's going to shift the market labor

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:49.823
supply curve to the left.
