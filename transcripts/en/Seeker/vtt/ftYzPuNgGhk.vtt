IT'S SAINT PATRICK'S WEEKEND!!!!!!

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.200
A time to celebrate the work of Saint Patrick
who converted the Irish from Paganism to Catholicism.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:18.220
In America, this means getting medievally
blackout ffffffffffwasted!

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.250
Huh?

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:28.470
Howdy Irish and Irish-wannabes, Trace here
for DNews with some drunk science.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.589
Now there's drunk, and then there's BLACKOUT
drunk.

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:35.340
Those are the times when you're so bombed
you literally have no memory of anything you

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.450
did or said.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.540
A whole chunk of time is just lost.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.700
Count yourself lucky if this has never happened
to you.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.560
But why does this happen at all?

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.830
First let's talk about how memories are made.

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:49.200
Scientists aren't EXACTLY sure, but they THINK
it has to do with the hippocampus.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.890
On a normal day, the synapses of your brain
communicate with each other to build your

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:54.890
experiences.

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.510
It's a chemical process pulling in information
from your senses, experiences and feelings

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.300
at the time all folded into the cells of your
grey matter.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:06.190
Your cells communicate with each other using
a neurotransmitter chemical called glutamate.

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.759
Glutamate helps bridge the synaptic gap between
brain cells so memories can be stored and

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:11.759
accessed.

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:14.729
But alcohol is a toxin that affects the glutamate.

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:15.979
See where I'm going?

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:20.259
According to a study in the journal Alcoholism:
Clinical &amp; Experimental Research functional

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:25.689
MRI scans of drunk students found our brains,
once intoxicated, increase blood flow to the

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:30.939
parts that control attention and cognitive
functioning as well as the parts that create

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:31.939
memory.

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:35.889
As the blood becomes more and more saturated
with alcohol, females will begin to black

00:01:35.889 --> 00:01:37.929
out, and then males.

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:41.600
Blackouts start at a blood alcohol level of
around Point-One-Five.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:48.600
During blackout, or a drug-induced brain dysfunction,
the hippocampus stops writing memories.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.240
Basically, our 20-30 seconds of short-term
memory gets full and resets.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.630
You didn't FORGET, you weren't even RECORDING,
dude!

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.499
You could ask a blackout drunk person about
a story from their childhood, but ask them

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:03.079
what happened a few minutes ago -- and they
would have no recollection.

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:07.869
According to Boston College, a blacked out
person is basically a walking, talking unconscious

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:08.869
person.

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.200
Sometimes blackouts let fragments of memories
through, but they aren't all the senses, thoughts

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.920
and experiences -- instead they're just pieces.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.760
When we ask our friends, "What happened last
night" we are EXTREMELY vulnerable to suggestion...

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.189
Those memories were never written down, but
since the brain is a glutton for context you're

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:28.019
CREATING the memories from the stories your
friends are telling.

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:32.730
It might SEEM like a lot of people have blackout
nights, but only 40-percent of college student

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.400
have EVER blacked out.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.230
If you DO experience them, you're more likely
to fall back into them if you drink heavily

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:39.860
on a daily basis.

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:46.110
Research from the 1940s found alcoholism and
blackouts were correlated, but there's no

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.110
causation.

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.780
Newer research says some people are more perceptible
based on body and brain chemistry, weight,

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.060
sex, and so on.

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.580
Anyone can have a blackout if they drink too
much, but if they happen too often, it can

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.799
mess up your brain chemistry and potentially
cause long-term damage -- not to mention the

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:01.799
bad decisionmaking.

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:04.870
If you want to avoid blackouts, don't drink
so fast!

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:10.550
Your body can metabolize one drink and hour
-- so get your buzz on, but don't get craazy.

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:11.930
Celebrate Saint Patrick's Day responsibly.

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:12.930
SlÃ¡inte, everyone!

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.430
