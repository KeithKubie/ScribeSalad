00:00:00.734 --> 00:00:02.235
- Listen to that?

00:00:02.235 --> 00:00:03.803
(siren)

00:00:03.803 --> 00:00:06.406 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Yeah, there's some
crime happening,

00:00:06.406 --> 00:00:08.308
there's definitely
some crime happening,

00:00:08.308 --> 00:00:11.678 align:start size:94% position:6%
but it's not in our area,
so we're not required

00:00:11.678 --> 00:00:13.613
to respond to the call.

00:00:14.614 --> 00:00:16.549 align:start size:88% position:13%
Next time use the walk.
- crosswalk.

00:00:16.549 --> 00:00:18.184
- The crosswalk.

00:00:18.184 --> 00:00:20.754
- Yeah, yeah next time you
use the crosswalk, okay.

00:00:20.754 --> 00:00:23.923 align:start size:94% position:6%
- I didn't mean an
actual wok, I didn't mean

00:00:23.923 --> 00:00:26.192
like a pan, I didn't
want that to be like a

00:00:26.192 --> 00:00:27.460
racial stereotype.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.529 align:start size:94% position:6%
- I heard wok vegetables.
- Alright.

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:30.730
- Chinese wok.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.866 align:start size:88% position:13%
- So, next time I won't
say walk, I'll say,

00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:36.569
"stay between the parallel
white lines, oriental woman."

00:00:36.569 --> 00:00:38.338
- That's much better.

00:00:43.376 --> 00:00:46.046
(upbeat music)

00:00:52.285 --> 00:00:53.386
- Yeah, you got a guy over there

00:00:53.386 --> 00:00:54.888
in the bushes taking a (bleep).

00:00:54.888 --> 00:00:56.089
Sir, are you okay tonight?

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:57.323
- Yeah, are you doing alright?

00:00:57.323 --> 00:00:58.291
- Yes sir.

00:00:58.291 --> 00:00:59.592 align:start size:72% position:28%
- Okay.
- Stay cool.

00:00:59.592 --> 00:01:00.960
Let us know if you
need any TP, okay?

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:01.795
- I will.

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:04.464
(police radio)

00:01:04.464 --> 00:01:05.899
- You wanna roll
down the window?

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:07.233
How you doin'?
- It's good.

00:01:07.233 --> 00:01:09.269
- Okay, and make sure
we use a condom, right,

00:01:09.269 --> 00:01:11.171
and enjoy yourself.

00:01:11.171 --> 00:01:14.574
- I think she was giving
him a handjob at the light.

00:01:14.574 --> 00:01:15.842
- Hand-Doogie.

00:01:15.842 --> 00:01:19.079
- It's not a handjob,
it's a hand adventure.

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:22.749
(mouthed war sound effects)

00:01:23.683 --> 00:01:25.085
Sir, excuse me, sir.

00:01:25.085 --> 00:01:27.887 align:start size:84% position:16%
- This guy's a
real dance machine.

00:01:27.887 --> 00:01:29.889
Look at this guy, he
might not be human.

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:31.991
- He's been playing a lot
of dance dance revolution

00:01:31.991 --> 00:01:33.426
I take it.

00:01:33.426 --> 00:01:35.528 align:start position:0%
This is a cell phone free
corner, you wanna fold that up,

00:01:35.528 --> 00:01:37.730
put it in your pocket
and get on your way.

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:39.866
Sir, you got any dope on you?

00:01:39.866 --> 00:01:41.167
No, nothing.

00:01:41.167 --> 00:01:43.403
- Do us a favor and
just keep it moving.

00:01:43.403 --> 00:01:45.572
- I see you still standing here.

00:01:45.572 --> 00:01:49.275 align:start size:97% position:3%
We know that when we get to
the other side of this tunnel,

00:01:49.275 --> 00:01:51.978
it's a part of the city
that's frequented by

00:01:51.978 --> 00:01:52.979
the street ninja.

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.048
- Ooh, what's that!?

00:01:55.048 --> 00:01:56.282
- Street ninja.

00:01:59.352 --> 00:02:02.288
(slow techno music)

00:02:20.273 --> 00:02:23.610 align:start size:88% position:13%
Look alive, the weird
thing is just back here.

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.347
(mouthed siren sound effect)

00:02:28.948 --> 00:02:31.151 align:start size:88% position:13%
- When you see
something like Musey...

00:02:31.151 --> 00:02:32.552
- Takes my breath away.

00:02:32.552 --> 00:02:34.420
- That's right.
- I love it.

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.159
- It's as though what Musey
is missing between his legs,

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:41.761 align:start size:88% position:13%
is punching Officer
John right in the chest.

00:02:41.761 --> 00:02:43.296
- Augh!

00:02:43.296 --> 00:02:47.333
- Sir, you have one too many
bags for this jurisdiction.

00:02:48.902 --> 00:02:50.303
Thumbs up to you.

00:02:57.844 --> 00:03:00.780
- There she is, every night
we like to come by here,

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.050
and watch out favorite lady
work out on her elliptical.

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.586
- She's slowing down,
she must be going up

00:03:06.586 --> 00:03:07.820
a digital hill.

00:03:08.655 --> 00:03:09.956
- Look at her.

00:03:09.956 --> 00:03:12.458 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Get outta my car, now!
- Jesus christ.

00:03:12.458 --> 00:03:16.296
- Get out, get out!
- Alright, alright.

00:03:16.296 --> 00:03:19.632
- You really think this is
alright, you go into my room

00:03:19.632 --> 00:03:22.068
and you take my police
officer uniforms and

00:03:22.068 --> 00:03:23.469
the two of you put 'em on,

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:25.572 align:start size:84% position:16%
and you start driving
around in my car,

00:03:25.572 --> 00:03:28.775
that Ma sold me, not you, me!

00:03:28.775 --> 00:03:32.078 align:start size:97% position:3%
You know, get these hats,
okay, take the shirts off now,

00:03:32.078 --> 00:03:33.346
take 'em off.

00:03:33.346 --> 00:03:35.815
You took that outta my
(bleep) laundry pile.

00:03:35.815 --> 00:03:39.419
You and you, never again
will you be seen in my car.

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:40.853
- We like the bus anyway.

00:03:40.853 --> 00:03:42.789 align:start size:97% position:3%
- You know what get the
(bleep), shut the (bleep) up,

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:44.090
gimme that (bleep) thing.

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:45.091
Never again!

00:03:46.726 --> 00:03:48.728
- You gotta, it's locked.

00:03:48.728 --> 00:03:52.899 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Don't tell me
about my (bleep) car!

00:03:56.035 --> 00:03:57.737
- We love you, John.

00:03:57.737 --> 00:04:01.841
- Eat (bleep) and
die, you (bleep).

00:04:05.111 --> 00:04:08.214
- Yeah, we're gonna need backup.

00:04:08.214 --> 00:04:09.782
- We can walk it.

00:04:09.782 --> 00:04:12.385 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I'd rather get
picked up if we can.

00:04:12.385 --> 00:04:14.988
(police radio)

00:04:20.193 --> 00:04:22.195
