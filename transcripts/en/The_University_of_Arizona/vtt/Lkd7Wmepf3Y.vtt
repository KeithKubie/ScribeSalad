[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.490
Probably after San
Xavier Mission,

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.280
Old Main is the most important
building in Southern Arizona.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.280
I don't think you'd get a
lot of arguments about that.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.362
The importance of it relative
to the University of Arizona,

00:00:29.362 --> 00:00:31.320
and the importance of
the University of Arizona

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.420
in this community.

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:37.410
And so when you get to work
on that, that's spectacular.

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.210
When you get to
work on a building

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.982
that is not just
important, but as we've

00:00:41.982 --> 00:00:44.190
worked on the building,
we've come to understand what

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.750
a great building it is.

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.730
What a great building
it is for this climate,

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.880
for the U of A campus,
for this community.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.920
And to get to follow in the
footsteps of the architect

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:05.357
and builder who did that project
in 1887 to 1891 is privilege.

00:01:05.357 --> 00:01:06.690
How often do you get to do that?

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.590
The way we practice
architecture is very much

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.630
tied to this place,
a sense of place,

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.210
and Tucson is a very
demanding climate.

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.440
And it's also a location with
a big, long cultural history.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.850
And the buildings
that we try to do,

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.280
that are contemporary
buildings, all

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.280
need to respond to the
desert environment,

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.122
and all need to be responsive
to the culture of this place.

00:01:39.122 --> 00:01:40.830
And that's what I mean
by sense of place.

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:42.800
And people use it
in terms of art.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.960
People use it in terms of music.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.280
It's the connection between
an art form or a design,

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.195
and the location in
which it's placed.

00:01:54.195 --> 00:01:56.320
[BANGING]

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.490
So when we first
started the project,

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.010
there was this rumor
floating around.

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:04.960
And the rumor
floating around was

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:10.690
that the floor between the
upper level and the lower level

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:11.590
was filled with dirt.

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.830
And we didn't know if
that was true or not.

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.100
It was a pretty strong
rumor and, sure enough,

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:27.550
the entire floor, about
12,000 square feet

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.860
of floor between the
first and second,

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.770
has about 2 and
1/2 inches of dirt

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.460
covering the entire
space between the floor

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:37.840
and the ceiling.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.660
And the reason they did that
was for sound attenuation,

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.620
that you had a wooden floor
with a wooden structure sitting

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.080
over classrooms over classrooms.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.940
And people were worried that
as people walked on the floor,

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.710
that the sound would
reverberate down.

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:57.780
And a good way to deaden sound
is with a massive material,

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.480
a heavy material, and so
dirt was the perfect material

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:02.330
to use.

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.490
So when you opened up the floor,
you were looking at all dirt,

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:11.380
and we were looking at the floor
after they took the dirt out,

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.170
and we noticed that there
were pieces, every once

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:15.430
in awhile, that were painted.

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:16.930
And we couldn't
figure out what that

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.086
was until we took all those
out and put them together

00:03:20.086 --> 00:03:21.460
in a puzzle, and
it turned out it

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:25.900
was the original construction
sign with the name

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.450
of the contractor on it.

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.240
And they just cut that
up in little pieces

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.990
and used that for the shelving.

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:35.990
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.870
What the architect,
James Creighton, did

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:54.880
is he understood
that over the years

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.190
this building was going
to grow and change.

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.450
The demands on it were
going to change over time.

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:02.620
And so what he built was
a very simple structure,

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.130
in which it consists
of a cruciform,

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:10.090
and then he built four
quadrants, four big rooms.

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:15.730
And then he built two wings,
north and south, which

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.560
were all originally empty.

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:22.750
And he designed that so that all
of the people at the University

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:27.640
of Arizona that followed
could modify those spaces

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:30.400
as they needed them
over hundreds of years.

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.700
And so our intent is to
take this historic shell

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:40.270
and make it back the way it
was when it was first built,

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.830
and then go in and fill in that
shell with all brand new uses,

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:49.360
with new technology, and new
offices, and new furniture,

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.300
and be able to tell
the difference.

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.970
So when you walk
into Old Main, you

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.367
will understand that you're
looking at a modern interior

00:04:58.367 --> 00:04:59.325
in a historic building.

00:04:59.325 --> 00:05:01.620
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.080
I'm going to really
honored to be

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:09.880
part of this next iteration--
this next group of users

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:15.500
that try to respect
that original building.

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.030
We had a really nice
visit with President Hart.

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:22.420
And we were standing
in this big open space,

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:25.180
and we were talking
about the glass walls

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.340
and the contemporary materials.

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:30.117
And I just turned
to her, and I said

00:05:30.117 --> 00:05:32.200
you know this gives me a
little bit of goosebumps,

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:36.190
because this is exactly what
James Creighton intended

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:39.910
us to do when he finished
the building in 1891.

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:44.180
He knew that 122
years later, folks

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:46.180
would be in here doing
exactly what we're doing.

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:48.930
