essentially is more important and if you

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060
 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.839

well there's no doubt that with the

knowledge there's a collapse of time and
space and so the cultural differences

interpreted so differently in Tehran and
in New York so I'm more interested in in

in New York so I'm more interested in in
 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:46.360
in New York so I'm more interested in in
identifying those differences and and

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.370
identifying those differences and and
