00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:02.970
Martin likes to
make flower bouquets

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.670
that each have 3
violets and 4 tulips.

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.680
If the price of a violet is V
and the price of a tulip is T,

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.370
match the expressions
to their meanings.

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.140
So let's see-- the price
of 1 of Martin's bouquets.

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:23.770
So one of Martin's bouquets
has 3 violets and 4 tulips.

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:26.290
So the 3 violets are
going to cost 3 times

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:28.190
the price of the
violet, which is V. So

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:30.325
that's the cost of
the violets, 3V.

00:00:30.325 --> 00:00:32.330
And then the 4 tulips
are going to cost

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:33.990
4 times the price of a tulip.

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:35.350
So that's 4T.

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:36.980
So it's 3V plus 4T.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.151
So it's not this one.

00:00:38.151 --> 00:00:38.650
Let's see.

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.530
This one right over
here, this is 4T plus 3V.

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.250
So this is the price of 4
tulips, 4 times the price

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.400
of a tulip, plus 3 times
the price of a violet.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.850
The price of 3 of
Martin's bouquets,

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.730
so it's essentially going
to be 3 times this quantity

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:54.470
right over here.

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:55.761
This is the price of 1 bouquet.

00:00:55.761 --> 00:00:56.950
We want 3 of them.

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:01.430
So it's going to be 3 times
the quantity 4T plus 3V.

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:02.590
And let's see.

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.020
If I were to actually multiply
this out, 3 times 4T is 12T,

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.452
and then plus 3 times 3V is 9V.

00:01:09.452 --> 00:01:10.910
So this is the same
thing if I were

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.714
to distribute the
3-- is 12T plus 9V.

00:01:14.714 --> 00:01:16.130
Well, that's this
right over here.

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.827
These two are
equivalent expressions.

00:01:18.827 --> 00:01:19.410
And let's see.

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:21.118
Are any of these other
things equivalent?

00:01:21.118 --> 00:01:23.740
No, this says 3
times 3T plus 4V.

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.310
So I'm going to put this
in the not used bucket.

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.739
And then I have--
let's see-- 3V plus 2T.

00:01:30.739 --> 00:01:32.530
I'm going to put it in
the not used bucket.

00:01:35.377 --> 00:01:35.960
And let's see.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:41.410
This has 2V plus 4T plus V.
So if I were to simplify this,

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.276
if I were to combine the V
terms-- if I have two V's and I

00:01:44.276 --> 00:01:46.460
add another V, that's
three V's plus 4T.

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.975
So this is actually the
same thing as the price of 1

00:01:48.975 --> 00:01:49.850
of Martin's bouquets.

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.850
So you could view this
as the price of 2 violets

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.450
plus the price of 4 tulips
plus another violet.

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.030
So it's really the price
of 3 violets and 4 tulips.

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:59.540
So let's check our answer.

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.490
We got it right.
