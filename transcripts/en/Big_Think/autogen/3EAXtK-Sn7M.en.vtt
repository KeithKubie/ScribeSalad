gravitational lensing signature and we

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530
gravitational lensing signature and we
 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.530
gravitational lensing signature and we
had to develop a whole mathematical

had to develop a whole mathematical
 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.649
had to develop a whole mathematical

began telling us about all these

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130
began telling us about all these
 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.719

and the feelings i got when looking at

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420
and the feelings i got when looking at
 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.430

always a nice feeling because you know

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700
always a nice feeling because you know
