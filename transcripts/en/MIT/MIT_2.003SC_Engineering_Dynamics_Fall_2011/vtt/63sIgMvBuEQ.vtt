00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.540
PROFESSOR: Last, kind of under
the announcements category,

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.990
is I want to talk
about the muddy cards.

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.510
So I've used those
many times in the past.

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:30.870
Last time was the first
time I handed them out.

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:32.790
And your comments were great.

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.445
This was really a good lecture
to have handed them out.

00:00:38.445 --> 00:00:42.340
We covered lots of interesting
important concepts.

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.170
And so I'm going to review
a couple of things that

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.800
came up in the muddy cards.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.730
A couple of the most
positive comments

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.840
is people really like the
demos, and they really

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.535
like the explanations,
especially with examples.

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.320
People particularly
commented it was

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.180
really helpful to compute
angular momentum from two

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.010
different points.

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:08.780
And you get the
revelation that you

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.030
get two very different answers.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.440
So that's a really
important point.

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.090
And somebody then
asked the question,

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.060
said, well, I
thought that vectors

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.450
were independent of
the coordinate system

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.270
that you select.

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.080
It's true.

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.620
A velocity ought
to be a velocity

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.660
no matter whether it's
r theta or x, y, z.

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:33.800
But why?

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.990
That seems to kind of violate
that notion that vectors should

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.770
be independent of coordinates.

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.800
And yet we computed an
angular momentum with respect

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.930
to one place and respect
to a different place,

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.260
and we got different answers.

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:52.850
How do you resolve that?

00:01:55.836 --> 00:01:56.336
Yeah.

00:01:56.336 --> 00:01:59.822
AUDIENCE: It's sort of
like since it's moving,

00:01:59.822 --> 00:02:01.316
the coordinates
shouldn't matter.

00:02:01.316 --> 00:02:05.300
Like if it was equilibrium,
it wouldn't matter where

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:06.794
you would put the [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:14.264 --> 00:02:17.750
PROFESSOR: OK, well,
you're getting close.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.380
Here was the problem
I think we did.

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.700
And we chose this point,
which I'll call 2,

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.410
and this point,
which I'll call 1.

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:34.960
And we computed h1.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.740
I'll just call h1 with
respect to point 1.

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.970
We'll call this A. We
computed with respect to 1.

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.510
And we computed the
angular momentum of A

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.250
with respect to 2.

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:50.250
But in this case, angular
momentum of a particle with

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:57.710
respect to some location,
origin of a coordinate system,

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:04.440
is defined as r of the partial
with respect to the coordinate

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:10.920
system crossed with the linear
momentum of the particle that

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.095
you're-- we'll call it B here,
just the name of the particle.

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.520
The definition-- these
are both vectors.

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.740
You arch changing the vector.

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.030
It's a different vector.

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.960
Because this changes
in the two parts.

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.860
So it's not a constant
vector at all.

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.960
By its definition,
it is just something

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:37.180
different when you move to a
different place and this piece

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.680
changes.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.700
This piece is invariant,
but this piece is not.

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.390
And that's the
answer to that one.

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.730
Lots of people were still
not clear about Coriolis.

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.090
We'll work on that
as time goes by.

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:56.530
And people were
interested in how

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.900
to pick reference
frames and so forth.

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.487
Somebody made the suggestion,
try using some colored chalk.

00:04:02.487 --> 00:04:03.070
It would help.

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:04.319
I don't own any colored chalk.

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:06.594
My assistant just
walked in with some.

00:04:06.594 --> 00:04:08.010
She found some at
the last minute.

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:08.980
So I'll try doing that.

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.032
That's a good idea.

00:04:10.032 --> 00:04:11.990
And someone else says,
take a break in an hour.

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:13.850
And that's a pretty
good idea, too.

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:15.842
I'll try to remember to do that.

00:04:15.842 --> 00:04:17.050
So the muddy cards are great.

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:21.890
Please today we'll
do the same thing.

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:27.690
So let's start with this topic.

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.570
It's a subject
which we constantly

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:39.160
use throughout the
course doing dynamics.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.880
You have to be
able to figure out

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.710
coordinate systems,
degrees of freedom,

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.070
drawing free body diagrams.

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:52.930
So I'm going to do a few quick
examples-- coordinates, fbd's.

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:58.960
I picked some examples
here just to emphasize

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.010
a few different points.

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:04.010
Here we have a slope.

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:07.130
I've got a wheel.

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:07.970
It's a rigid body.

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:14.170
I pick a preliminary
coordinate system.

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:16.420
Sometimes you do that just
to help you think about it.

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:20.900
And now let's talk about
degrees of freedom.

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:22.730
What do we mean by
degrees of freedom?

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:39.640
I'm going to define it as
the number of independent

00:05:39.640 --> 00:06:00.585
coordinates necessary
to describe the motion.

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:08.380
So it's the number of
independent coordinates

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:10.690
that you need.

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:19.740
Now, with few exceptions,
I can compute that

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:28.270
by multiplying 6 times
the number of rigid bodies

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:33.750
in the problem plus 3 times
the number of particles

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:37.140
minus the constraints,
the number of constraints.

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:40.445
So this is the number
of rigid bodies.

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:47.885
This is the number of particles.

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:53.205
And C, this is the constraints.

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:03.650
So take a look at this problem.

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:06.750
A wheel's a rigid body.

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:08.970
The difference between a
rigid body and a particle

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:10.440
is a rigid body is big enough.

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:12.600
It has mass at some extent.

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:14.910
Its rotational
inertia will matter.

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:16.790
So here we've got a wheel.

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:19.300
So we've got certainly one
rigid body but no particles.

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:21.676
So in this case, n is 1, m is 0.

00:07:21.676 --> 00:07:23.300
And so the number of
degrees of freedom

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:25.216
that we should come up
with in this problem is

00:07:25.216 --> 00:07:28.620
going to look like 6 minus C.

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:30.060
And so then the
problem becomes--

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:32.470
let's identify what the
constraints are in the problem.

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:38.010
So I drew my initial
little coordinate system

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:42.150
just so that I can use language
like x, y, and z direction.

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:43.910
So z's coming out of the board.

00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:46.000
So in this problem,
let's figure out

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.330
how many constraints there are.

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.555
How about the y direction?

00:08:05.709 --> 00:08:07.500
The simplest kind of
constraints are things

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:08.800
that just allow no motion.

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:12.230
Can it move in the y direction?

00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:19.019
No, OK, so y, y dot,
y double dot, are 0.

00:08:19.019 --> 00:08:20.185
So that's a hard constraint.

00:08:20.185 --> 00:08:22.555
You can't move through the
wall in the y direction.

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:30.971
You have to make assumptions
when you're doing problems.

00:08:30.971 --> 00:08:33.179
You have to try to simplify
things as much as you can

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:34.303
so that you make them easy.

00:08:34.303 --> 00:08:37.500
So really I'm going to
assume in this problem-- I

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:41.210
haven't shown any constraints
or wheels or guides or rollers.

00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:46.312
But I'm going to assume that it
won't move in the z direction.

00:08:46.312 --> 00:08:47.520
So that's another constraint.

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:49.740
So this implies 1.

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:51.300
This implies another constraint.

00:08:56.090 --> 00:08:59.110
If I don't do this, if
I don't assume that,

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:02.370
then I just end up with
another equation of motion.

00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:04.830
For every degree of freedom,
you end up with a problem.

00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:07.180
You're going to need
an equation of motion.

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:09.020
So if I did not make
this assumption,

00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:13.300
I'd say that the summation of
the forces in the z direction

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:18.000
is equal to 0.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.980
And that's equal to the
mass times the acceleration

00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:25.670
of the body in the
z acceleration.

00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:28.327
It's a vector, vector component.

00:09:28.327 --> 00:09:29.910
And then you just
say, oh well, that's

00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:31.470
a trivial equation of motion.

00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:33.095
And so you could deal
with it that way.

00:09:33.095 --> 00:09:36.110
But we'll just assume that
we have no motion in the z.

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:39.710
And that gives us
another constraint.

00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:42.840
Now we can assume
again that there's

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:45.580
constraints in the problem,
or it's well behaved,

00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:48.000
in that the thing
won't fall over.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.910
It won't roll over.

00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:53.400
And it won't change direction
running down the hill.

00:09:53.400 --> 00:10:06.410
So we'll assume no rotation
about the x or y axes.

00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:11.665
So that implies two
more constraints.

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:19.560
And finally, the constraints
can come in many flavors.

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:22.800
Finally we know
that in this problem

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:36.570
that I need to think
in terms of a rotation.

00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:40.120
So there's a positive rotation
in that coordinate system.

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:42.270
So now I have a
rotational coordinate

00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:46.910
that I can think about.

00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:52.710
But this now says that
if there's no slip,

00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:57.030
I can say that the distance
it rolls down the hill

00:10:57.030 --> 00:11:00.490
is minus r theta.

00:11:00.490 --> 00:11:03.540
That's a constraint.

00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:07.640
x and theta are not
independent of one another.

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:11.840
We're looking for the number
of independent coordinates

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:15.040
required to completely
describe the motion.

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:17.840
x and r are not independent
because of this no slip

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:19.090
condition.

00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:22.500
And so that implies yet another.

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:30.620
OK, so we've got one, two,
three, four, five constraints.

00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:32.890
And we said that the
number of degrees

00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:38.670
of freedom in this problem is
equal to 6 minus 5, which is 1.

00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:40.120
So you take the
single coordinate.

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:42.305
You could have told me
that long ago that that's

00:11:42.305 --> 00:11:43.570
what it's going to take.

00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:45.180
But this is the
sort of thinking you

00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:48.195
have to go through to come up
with all these constraints.

00:11:48.195 --> 00:11:50.070
So this is going to take
a single coordinate.

00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:51.520
It could be x.

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:54.520
It could be theta.

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:56.220
But you don't actually
need them both.

00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:58.946
You use them both for a while,
because it's convenient.

00:11:58.946 --> 00:12:00.320
But in the final
analysis, you'll

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:01.903
be able to write an
equation of motion

00:12:01.903 --> 00:12:05.320
just in terms of x or
just in terms of theta.

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:20.150
OK, free body diagram of
our wheel-- we said no slip.

00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:22.660
So here's your slope.

00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:24.140
You know you've got mg.

00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:30.140
You know there's going to be
a normal force from the slope.

00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:32.890
There may also be
some tangential force

00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:38.660
that makes it impossible
for it not to slip, some f.

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:42.150
So there's the free body
diagram, in this case.

00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:51.960
What if-- I'll do e here, or do
a case ii here, slip allowed.

00:12:57.130 --> 00:13:05.160
Then how many
constraints do we have?

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:05.920
Just four.

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:08.392
Because now you can no
longer say that this is true.

00:13:08.392 --> 00:13:09.850
They're independent
of one another.

00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:13.800
They take on values not
controlled by this formulation.

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:16.255
So 6 minus 4 gives you 2.

00:13:16.255 --> 00:13:17.630
And you're going
to end up having

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:20.300
to have both x and theta
probably as your chosen

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:22.030
coordinates to do the problem.

00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:24.312
And you'll end up with
two equations of motion.

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:43.320
So I've got a hockey puck here.

00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:49.270
I've drawn kind of a
3D perspective of this.

00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:51.660
So it has a coordinate
system out here.

00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:53.500
The z-axis is going like that.

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:55.220
So here's my z.

00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:56.230
Here's my x.

00:13:56.230 --> 00:14:04.930
Here's my y in the
plane of the ice

00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:07.896
that this thing is sliding on.

00:14:07.896 --> 00:14:11.490
So this is my z-coordinate.

00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:13.560
And I have string
wrapped around it.

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:17.224
And I've got a piece of
string coming off like that.

00:14:17.224 --> 00:14:18.890
And I'm pulling on
it with some tension.

00:14:21.950 --> 00:14:26.360
Because otherwise
the only constraints

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:29.540
are it's sitting on
this icy surface, which

00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:31.490
I'm going to assume
is-- well, I don't even

00:14:31.490 --> 00:14:33.130
have to assume
it's frictionless.

00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:33.930
I could.

00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:36.170
So let's figure out how
many equations of motion

00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:37.600
we're going to need here.

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:42.230
So the number of degrees
of freedom, 6 times-- this

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:43.502
is a rigid body.

00:14:43.502 --> 00:14:44.335
It's not a particle.

00:14:44.335 --> 00:14:46.150
And there's only one of them.

00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:51.540
So it's 6 times 1 minus C and
the number of constraints.

00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:55.400
So can it move into the
table, into the surface?

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:58.680
No, so that's a constraint in z.

00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:02.530
Are there any constraints
in the x or y?

00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:05.360
It can rotate about z.

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:08.680
But it can't rotate
about the x or y-axes.

00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:11.340
All right, so constraint
into z is one.

00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:14.385
Can't rotate about
x or y-- two, three.

00:15:14.385 --> 00:15:15.580
Are there any others?

00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:25.800
Who thinks I may
have missed one?

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:29.920
OK, I'd say we've got 6 minus 3.

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:32.665
We're going to need
three equations of motion

00:15:32.665 --> 00:15:35.040
to be able to actually describe
the motion of this thing.

00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:42.220
And we'd probably use--
this is a pretty good

00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:43.050
coordinate system.

00:15:43.050 --> 00:15:50.973
We'd probably use an x, a y,
and some theta with respect

00:15:50.973 --> 00:15:51.473
to z-axis.

00:15:54.640 --> 00:16:10.400
All right, another
quick example--

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:12.985
so we've got a rod
leaning against a wall.

00:16:12.985 --> 00:16:20.192
It's length L. Actually,
I don't want to do that.

00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:23.880
It's L long.

00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:28.690
It's got a center of mass here
at the middle, uniform rod.

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:36.230
Let this be x, y, z
coming out of the board,

00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:40.940
maybe give it an angle here just
to help us describe motions.

00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:43.410
You might start off with a
preliminary little coordinate

00:16:43.410 --> 00:16:45.880
system just so you could
think that, OK, no motion

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:47.660
in the x, no rotation in this.

00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:49.160
But once you get
the problem, you're

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:50.900
ready to set up the
equations of motion,

00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:53.930
you might decide, OK, I
know I need two coordinates.

00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:56.860
And the ones I've preliminarily
chosen aren't too good.

00:16:56.860 --> 00:16:59.060
Then you change, and you
pick the really good ones.

00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:01.018
But I'm just making the
preliminary assessments

00:17:01.018 --> 00:17:04.680
so I can assess
the problem here.

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:11.280
Again, the degrees of
freedom-- 6 times 1 minus C.

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:14.089
Because I only have
one rigid body.

00:17:14.089 --> 00:17:19.975
Now, the constraints here
are a little more subtle.

00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:30.530
Let me just discuss
these two points.

00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:33.840
What can you say about
the motion at point A?

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:36.921
This is right here where
it touches the wall.

00:17:36.921 --> 00:17:38.420
This thing is sliding
down the wall.

00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:40.580
It might be
frictionless, might not.

00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:42.820
Whether or not friction
acts doesn't really

00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:45.000
change the number of
degrees of freedom

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.050
unless you invoke
things like no slip.

00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:52.180
What can you say
kinematically about motion,

00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:53.610
about the motion at A?

00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:55.660
Does the wall
restrict the motion?

00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:56.890
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:17:56.890 --> 00:17:58.987
PROFESSOR: In what direction?

00:17:58.987 --> 00:18:00.671
AUDIENCE: x.

00:18:00.671 --> 00:18:01.921
PROFESSOR: In which direction?

00:18:01.921 --> 00:18:02.410
AUDIENCE: x.

00:18:02.410 --> 00:18:03.785
PROFESSOR: In x
direction, right.

00:18:03.785 --> 00:18:07.159
So is this body constrained
in the x direction?

00:18:07.159 --> 00:18:09.380
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:11.270
PROFESSOR: Pardon?

00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:12.260
I hear a no.

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:14.890
I hear some yeses.

00:18:14.890 --> 00:18:18.466
What about at B?

00:18:18.466 --> 00:18:20.490
Is it constrained at B?

00:18:20.490 --> 00:18:21.281
In the--

00:18:21.281 --> 00:18:21.780
AUDIENCE: y.

00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:24.720
PROFESSOR: y direction, OK.

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:29.970
I didn't bring my big foam disk.

00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:33.960
But earlier in the term,
I said that the definition

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:40.820
of translation is that
all points on a rigid body

00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:46.980
do what if you're rectilinear
or curvilinear translation as

00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:48.713
opposed to rotation?

00:18:48.713 --> 00:18:50.040
AUDIENCE: Move in parallel.

00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:55.380
PROFESSOR: All points move
in parallel, exactly right.

00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:59.560
That means that if we use
real strict definitions

00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:03.520
of translation and rotation,
that if I constrain

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:07.680
the motion of any
point on that object,

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:12.260
that object is now not allowed
to translate in that direction

00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:14.710
by the definition
of translation.

00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:18.340
So this point constrains
it in the x direction.

00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:22.170
This constrains it
in the y direction.

00:19:22.170 --> 00:19:32.786
And we're going to-- so it's
constrained in translation.

00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:44.410
And that implies 2.

00:19:44.410 --> 00:19:58.416
And b, we'll assume
that z motion is 0.

00:19:58.416 --> 00:19:59.790
We'll just assume
there's nothing

00:19:59.790 --> 00:20:02.290
going on out of the plane.

00:20:02.290 --> 00:20:04.040
So that gives me another one.

00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:13.440
And I'll assume no rotation.

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:17.170
I'm not going to allow any
rotation in this problem.

00:20:17.170 --> 00:20:34.350
I'm not interested in rotation
about the x or about the y,

00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:35.750
about these axes.

00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:37.800
And that implies two more.

00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:41.705
So we have two,
three, four, five.

00:20:43.842 --> 00:20:46.050
And I better not have any
more than that or the thing

00:20:46.050 --> 00:20:47.970
can't move.

00:20:47.970 --> 00:20:51.930
So in this case, this
is 6 minus 5 equals 1.

00:20:51.930 --> 00:20:54.250
I need a single coordinate
to describe the motion.

00:20:54.250 --> 00:20:55.350
And if you look at
it, you say, well,

00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:56.891
that's kind of
intuitive and obvious.

00:20:56.891 --> 00:20:59.731
If I specify the
x position here,

00:20:59.731 --> 00:21:00.980
I could figure everything out.

00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:03.605
If I know the length and the x,
I could figure out where it is.

00:21:03.605 --> 00:21:05.615
If I know the y
position and the length,

00:21:05.615 --> 00:21:07.120
I could figure out where it is.

00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:08.850
If I know theta, I
could figure it out.

00:21:08.850 --> 00:21:10.467
I only need one.

00:21:10.467 --> 00:21:12.175
But that strict
definition of translation

00:21:12.175 --> 00:21:13.280
is really helpful here.

00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:18.700
This thing, this object,
is in pure rotation.

00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:23.260
And if it's in pure rotation,
it must rotate about some point.

00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:24.172
Where?

00:21:24.172 --> 00:21:25.255
You know how to find that?

00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:31.440
What's the velocity here?

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:34.460
It's got gravity acting on
it, so it's probably down.

00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:35.860
But it's parallel to the wall.

00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:36.990
It has to be.

00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:38.840
What's the velocity here?

00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:42.460
It's got to be
parallel to the wall.

00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:45.370
If I draw perpendicular
to that-- if I'm saying,

00:21:45.370 --> 00:21:47.600
this is rotation.

00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:51.036
All points in the body
rotate at the same rate.

00:21:51.036 --> 00:21:52.910
But their speed is
determined by the distance

00:21:52.910 --> 00:21:56.110
away from the
center of rotation.

00:21:56.110 --> 00:21:58.520
But if it's pure
rotation, there must be

00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:00.270
a center of rotation somewhere.

00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:03.610
And it must be perpendicular
to any velocity vector.

00:22:03.610 --> 00:22:04.950
So you draw the perpendicular.

00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:07.680
You draw the perpendicular.

00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:12.159
And here is the instantaneous
center of rotation, the ICR.

00:22:12.159 --> 00:22:14.284
There's a little short
section in the book on that.

00:22:17.250 --> 00:22:21.840
When this thing drops down to
here, same kind of arguments

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:24.320
hold.

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:30.050
But the center of rotation
has changed locations.

00:22:30.050 --> 00:22:31.021
Yeah.

00:22:31.021 --> 00:22:36.320
AUDIENCE: So is this
not translating x and y?

00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:41.910
PROFESSOR: So now let's talk
about the center of mass.

00:22:41.910 --> 00:22:44.900
So she asked-- excuse me, I
should repeat the question.

00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:48.500
You guys aren't holding
me to that very well.

00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:52.540
Raise your hands if I don't
repeat an important question.

00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:53.920
She says, is it not translating?

00:22:56.720 --> 00:23:01.750
We've determined
that-- let me ask you,

00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:04.170
does the center of mass move?

00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:10.984
Does Newton's second
law apply to the motion

00:23:10.984 --> 00:23:11.900
of the center of mass?

00:23:15.246 --> 00:23:16.680
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:18.114
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it's got to.

00:23:18.114 --> 00:23:20.050
So the center of
mass translates--

00:23:20.050 --> 00:23:21.240
no doubt about that.

00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:24.530
Newton's second
law applies to it.

00:23:24.530 --> 00:23:27.430
So we're not saying
that there isn't motion

00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:29.236
of the system in the x and y.

00:23:29.236 --> 00:23:31.610
We're just saying that that
motion is caused by rotation.

00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:38.717
It's not caused by
what is strictly

00:23:38.717 --> 00:23:39.675
defined as translation.

00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:55.872
Free body diagram,
the reason-- let's

00:23:55.872 --> 00:23:57.580
think about a free
body diagram for this.

00:23:57.580 --> 00:24:00.210
Here's our rod.

00:24:00.210 --> 00:24:03.930
There must be-- I'll let
it be frictionless to keep

00:24:03.930 --> 00:24:05.310
the problem simple for a moment.

00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:07.610
That means there must
be just a normal force

00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:09.020
in the x direction here.

00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:10.710
I'll call it Nx.

00:24:10.710 --> 00:24:15.360
And there must be a normal
force in the y, call it Ny.

00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:18.035
The center of mass,
there must be an Mg.

00:24:22.550 --> 00:24:25.300
So now that I set the
problem up this way,

00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:27.530
how many unknowns are
there in the problem?

00:24:27.530 --> 00:24:31.514
If I want to calculate literally
the motion of this thing,

00:24:31.514 --> 00:24:33.180
find an equation of
motion and solve it,

00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:34.500
how many unknowns do I have?

00:24:42.190 --> 00:24:43.443
How many do you think?

00:24:43.443 --> 00:24:44.044
AUDIENCE: One.

00:24:44.044 --> 00:24:44.960
PROFESSOR: I hear one.

00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:46.105
I see two on the board.

00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:51.409
But is two the right answer?

00:24:51.409 --> 00:24:51.950
I hear three.

00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:53.280
Who said three?

00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:55.010
All right, what's the third one?

00:24:55.010 --> 00:24:56.850
AUDIENCE: Acceleration?

00:24:56.850 --> 00:24:58.820
PROFESSOR: How do you
describe acceleration

00:24:58.820 --> 00:25:04.518
with a coordinate of some kind?

00:25:04.518 --> 00:25:07.520
So there's yet another unknown.

00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:09.890
It's probably the thing that
you're trying to solve for.

00:25:09.890 --> 00:25:14.000
It's actually the motion itself
described by theta for x or y,

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.190
whatever you do.

00:25:15.190 --> 00:25:18.940
There's at least three unknowns
in this problem the way

00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:22.580
you see it in this
free body diagram.

00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:25.100
So you've got to figure
out ways around that.

00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:26.780
This instantaneous
center of rotation

00:25:26.780 --> 00:25:30.060
gives you one possible
way around that.

00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:33.780
Because about an instantaneous
center, it's not moving.

00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:34.620
It's an axis.

00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:36.650
It's not moving.

00:25:36.650 --> 00:25:38.240
We have a little
formula that says

00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:42.434
the time rate of change of
angular momentum-- torque

00:25:42.434 --> 00:25:44.850
is related to the time rate
of change of angular momentum.

00:25:44.850 --> 00:25:46.975
And you can have a messy
formula or a not so messy.

00:25:46.975 --> 00:25:52.250
And it's not so messy when the
axis of rotation is stationary.

00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:54.870
So at this instant in time,
the axis is stationary.

00:25:54.870 --> 00:26:00.530
You can say that the
torques about this point,

00:26:00.530 --> 00:26:04.410
the ICR, summation of
the torques with respect

00:26:04.410 --> 00:26:13.150
to the ICR, is equal to d, is
now a rigid body with respect

00:26:13.150 --> 00:26:19.820
to the ICR, dt.

00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:22.860
OK, in this problem,
what are the torques?

00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:24.730
Where do the torques come from?

00:26:24.730 --> 00:26:28.629
Is there any torque
caused by Nx?

00:26:28.629 --> 00:26:30.420
No, because there's no
moment on it, right?

00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:31.900
It's pointing right
at the center.

00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:34.320
Same thing-- no
torque caused by this.

00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:36.640
You want to find equations
that get rid of unknowns.

00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:38.787
So neither unknown
appear in this equation.

00:26:38.787 --> 00:26:40.120
Where does the torque come from?

00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:45.770
Gravity, right?

00:26:45.770 --> 00:26:50.700
And it's going to be some
Mg times a moment arm.

00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:53.740
And the moment arm is
going to be like that.

00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:56.026
So it's an L over 2 sine theta.

00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:02.030
And the sine you'll
have to figure out

00:27:02.030 --> 00:27:06.420
from an r cross and f.

00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:12.300
So you have an i cross
j, gives you a k.

00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:13.635
But it's in the minus direction.

00:27:13.635 --> 00:27:17.470
So I think it'll come out minus.

00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:18.750
But I could be wrong.

00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:20.610
I did that on the fly.

00:27:23.870 --> 00:27:25.690
So we're not going to
go further with this.

00:27:25.690 --> 00:27:30.440
But the instantaneous centers of
rotation could be really handy.

00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:36.634
OK, a final example
in this stuff--

00:27:36.634 --> 00:27:37.675
how are we doing on time?

00:27:52.170 --> 00:27:56.670
Couple of carts, so the
floor constrains the motion.

00:27:56.670 --> 00:28:03.305
And I've got a spring and a
dashpot and an M1 and an M2.

00:28:06.230 --> 00:28:08.173
And I want to figure
out how many-- yeah?

00:28:08.173 --> 00:28:09.960
AUDIENCE: I was just curious.

00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:14.109
Why is torque negative
in your earlier solution?

00:28:14.109 --> 00:28:15.900
PROFESSOR: Let's just
figure out r cross f.

00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:21.610
So my r-- you're saying,
why is the torque negative?

00:28:21.610 --> 00:28:31.140
The r is L/2 in the i hat.

00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:37.790
And the gravity crossed with
the force, which is Mg in the--

00:28:37.790 --> 00:28:43.180
but it's minus Mg in the j hat.

00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:45.130
So i cross j is positive k.

00:28:45.130 --> 00:28:47.863
But the minus sign
comes from there.

00:28:47.863 --> 00:28:51.560
AUDIENCE: What is that over
to the left [INAUDIBLE]?

00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:54.190
PROFESSOR: Well, I'm working
on the center of mass here.

00:28:54.190 --> 00:28:55.220
That's my equation.

00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:56.550
And this thing is L long.

00:28:56.550 --> 00:28:59.860
So half of the
length must be L/2.

00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:05.517
And I'm interested in this
side of the right triangle.

00:29:05.517 --> 00:29:07.892
AUDIENCE: Why are you interested
in that side rather than

00:29:07.892 --> 00:29:09.530
the side that
connects it to the--

00:29:09.530 --> 00:29:13.670
PROFESSOR: Because this side
crossed with that gives me 0.

00:29:13.670 --> 00:29:14.420
There's no moment.

00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:16.140
So this is a moment equation.

00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:18.930
I'm trying to compute moments.

00:29:18.930 --> 00:29:19.660
Yeah?

00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:22.366
AUDIENCE: Should the moment
come from the ICR load?

00:29:22.366 --> 00:29:23.532
PROFESSOR: Oh, you're right.

00:29:23.532 --> 00:29:24.823
I don't know what I'm thinking.

00:29:24.823 --> 00:29:26.440
I could have messed this up.

00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:27.700
It's got to be about the ICR.

00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:29.910
So the force is down.

00:29:29.910 --> 00:29:33.050
Ooh, it's got to be this one.

00:29:33.050 --> 00:29:36.450
I messed up-- good catch.

00:29:36.450 --> 00:29:41.910
So that's a cosine, still L/2.

00:29:41.910 --> 00:29:42.890
You've got a theta.

00:29:42.890 --> 00:29:48.790
You have a-- this is also theta.

00:29:48.790 --> 00:29:50.920
And we're looking
now for this side.

00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:55.130
Eh, it's still
sine theta, right?

00:29:55.130 --> 00:29:57.609
Does the sign still
work out the right way?

00:29:57.609 --> 00:29:58.525
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:02.890 --> 00:30:05.840
PROFESSOR: Good, OK,
I've got to keep rolling.

00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:09.720
I've got something else really
fun I want to talk about.

00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:11.426
So let's do this
example quickly.

00:30:11.426 --> 00:30:13.925
This is mostly to get you to
think about free body diagrams.

00:30:17.210 --> 00:30:21.080
This-- two rigid bodies.

00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:23.950
The degrees of freedom
quickly here-- 6 times 2.

00:30:23.950 --> 00:30:28.909
There's no particles--
minus c, so 12 minus c.

00:30:28.909 --> 00:30:29.450
Now how many?

00:30:29.450 --> 00:30:30.866
What does your
intuition tell you?

00:30:30.866 --> 00:30:32.830
How many independent
coordinates is it

00:30:32.830 --> 00:30:36.330
going to take to
solve this problem?

00:30:36.330 --> 00:30:38.340
Hold up your fingers.

00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:44.137
I see two, one, two, one.

00:30:44.137 --> 00:30:45.300
OK, one or two.

00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:51.240
Well, I think you can find 10
constraints in this problem.

00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:52.715
If you assume it
doesn't roll over

00:30:52.715 --> 00:30:55.100
and you assume it doesn't
move, you can find 10.

00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:57.880
You're going to need
two coordinates.

00:30:57.880 --> 00:31:01.290
Because just because you've
got a spring and a dashpot,

00:31:01.290 --> 00:31:02.950
they don't fix.

00:31:02.950 --> 00:31:05.050
They don't say there's
any particular relation

00:31:05.050 --> 00:31:07.644
between the motion of this
and the motion of that.

00:31:07.644 --> 00:31:09.560
You're going to need an
independent coordinate

00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:16.220
to describe the--
whoops, 2 times 6.

00:31:16.220 --> 00:31:18.240
This is 12 minus 10.

00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:22.250
You don't need an
independent coordinate

00:31:22.250 --> 00:31:24.730
to describe the motion
of each of these masses.

00:31:24.730 --> 00:31:27.720
And I'd probably choose a
coordinate that, let's say,

00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:29.560
goes from the center
of mass of this one.

00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:34.430
I'll call it x1, center of
mass of this one call it x2.

00:31:34.430 --> 00:31:36.930
And because I've been doing
problems, vibration problems

00:31:36.930 --> 00:31:39.520
and stuff like this,
for a long time,

00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:44.180
I'll tell you it's smart to
start your coordinates at 0

00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:47.030
when you have zero
spring forces.

00:31:47.030 --> 00:31:50.319
Or from the static
equilibrium position--

00:31:50.319 --> 00:31:51.610
that's the good place to start.

00:31:51.610 --> 00:31:55.100
So then your answer, if you're
at the static equilibrium

00:31:55.100 --> 00:32:00.220
position, then any non-zero
answers that come out of it

00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:02.990
are movement around that point.

00:32:02.990 --> 00:32:06.730
That's what mother nature does.

00:32:06.730 --> 00:32:09.480
A spring hanging on a
mass hanging on a spring,

00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:11.350
it has a static
equilibrium position.

00:32:11.350 --> 00:32:13.554
The vibration occurs around it.

00:32:13.554 --> 00:32:14.970
Your car is sitting
on the ground.

00:32:14.970 --> 00:32:18.840
The vibration is around its
static equilibrium position.

00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:27.770
So you usually choose these
at the static equilibrium.

00:32:27.770 --> 00:32:40.540
And you'll find that that
makes for the simplest

00:32:40.540 --> 00:32:42.080
equations of motion.

00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:46.200
They tend to not have
constants on the right hand

00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:51.730
side that's caused by gravity
or offsets or things like that.

00:32:51.730 --> 00:32:54.990
So this thing, actually a
problem very similar to this

00:32:54.990 --> 00:32:56.680
is on your homework.

00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:58.996
The homework says, go
find what these 10 are.

00:32:58.996 --> 00:33:00.370
So you can name
them pretty fast.

00:33:00.370 --> 00:33:02.970
That's why I'm not
doing it for you.

00:33:02.970 --> 00:33:08.150
What I do want to
do quickly here

00:33:08.150 --> 00:33:21.000
is just talk about how
you assign free body

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:22.500
diagrams for this problem.

00:33:32.230 --> 00:33:34.620
Because people, one of
the most easiest thing

00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:37.650
to get confused
about is figuring out

00:33:37.650 --> 00:33:40.010
the directions of
the forces that

00:33:40.010 --> 00:33:43.890
come from the springs in the
dashpots, which direction

00:33:43.890 --> 00:33:46.720
acts on each.

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:51.620
So I've made my
x's so that x1 is

00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:55.090
0 when this thing is at its
static equilibrium position.

00:33:55.090 --> 00:34:08.210
And I'm going to start by
assuming that x1 and x1 dot are

00:34:08.210 --> 00:34:09.730
positive.

00:34:09.730 --> 00:34:13.040
You just establish
positive motions.

00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:17.234
And you deduce the direction of
the spring and dashpot forces.

00:34:30.679 --> 00:34:34.030
OK, and you do
them one at a time.

00:34:34.030 --> 00:34:36.560
The problems we're
doing here are linear.

00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:39.480
Spring force is equal to kx.

00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:42.066
Dashpot forces are Bx dot.

00:34:42.066 --> 00:34:43.190
So they're linear problems.

00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:45.870
So the superposition holds.

00:34:45.870 --> 00:34:48.380
You can just do these
conceptually one at a time

00:34:48.380 --> 00:34:49.374
and figure them out.

00:34:49.374 --> 00:34:50.790
And then you add
them all together

00:34:50.790 --> 00:34:51.914
to get the complete answer.

00:34:51.914 --> 00:34:59.240
So if x1 moves in the
positive direction,

00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:03.380
what is the direction
that that spring

00:35:03.380 --> 00:35:06.400
puts on this mass as a result?

00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:07.750
Which direction is it?

00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:11.420
And my coordinate
system is positive.

00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:13.230
Here's x1.

00:35:13.230 --> 00:35:14.680
We'll do the same thing here.

00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:15.510
Here's x2.

00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:20.080
So if it moves in the positive
direction out to here,

00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:22.520
what is the spring going to do?

00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:25.315
No other motion allowed in
the system, just that one.

00:35:25.315 --> 00:35:27.080
It moves a little bit.

00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:28.960
What does the spring
do on that mass?

00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:29.922
AUDIENCE: Push back.

00:35:29.922 --> 00:35:34.760
PROFESSOR: Push back kx.

00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:37.890
And I let the sign be indicated
by the direction of the arrow.

00:35:37.890 --> 00:35:40.730
And I'll use that when I write
out my equation of motion.

00:35:40.730 --> 00:35:44.360
OK, now I'm going to
assume a positive bx1, so

00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:45.810
its velocity in that direction.

00:35:45.810 --> 00:35:47.408
What does the dashpot do?

00:35:47.408 --> 00:35:49.360
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:51.040
PROFESSOR: Resist
or [INAUDIBLE]?

00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:51.804
AUDIENCE: Resist.

00:35:51.804 --> 00:35:53.053
PROFESSOR: Pushes back, right?

00:35:53.053 --> 00:35:56.514
OK, so you have another
force here, bx1 dot.

00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:02.270
Now, this is if you
have two bodies.

00:36:02.270 --> 00:36:06.000
You have to have two free
body diagrams, one for each.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:11.100
But I need to know what's
the effect of x2 and x2 dot

00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:13.440
on this body.

00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:15.990
Well, let's just go
do the same thing.

00:36:15.990 --> 00:36:17.730
Let's let x2 be positive.

00:36:17.730 --> 00:36:20.275
Now it's the only motion.

00:36:20.275 --> 00:36:26.690
I have a positive movement of
x2 that stretches the spring.

00:36:26.690 --> 00:36:30.370
What is that spring
force applied to this?

00:36:30.370 --> 00:36:31.530
What direction is it in?

00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:38.481
This body is moving in that way.

00:36:38.481 --> 00:36:39.773
AUDIENCE: Positive x direction.

00:36:39.773 --> 00:36:41.189
PROFESSOR: Which
way is the spring

00:36:41.189 --> 00:36:42.387
going to pull on this thing?

00:36:42.387 --> 00:36:44.520
It's going to pull on it, right?

00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:50.950
So k, by amount kx2, and
of positive velocity,

00:36:50.950 --> 00:36:53.850
to the right.

00:36:53.850 --> 00:36:56.040
It makes the dashpot open up.

00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:59.871
What direction is the force
that dashpot puts on this?

00:36:59.871 --> 00:37:03.240
AUDIENCE: Positive x.

00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:06.160
PROFESSOR: bx2 dot.

00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:08.660
And now in this problem,
except for gravity,

00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:12.040
I've got a normal
force f and an Mg down.

00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:14.059
But all the action,
all the motion,

00:37:14.059 --> 00:37:15.350
is in the horizontal direction.

00:37:15.350 --> 00:37:20.481
I can write out an equation of
motion for the first rigid body

00:37:20.481 --> 00:37:20.980
here.

00:37:20.980 --> 00:37:26.020
And that's a sum of the forces
in the x direction on body

00:37:26.020 --> 00:37:28.670
one-- I'll give this
a 1 here-- in the x

00:37:28.670 --> 00:37:34.070
is equal to M1 x1 double dot.

00:37:34.070 --> 00:37:36.610
And now I can just write it out.

00:37:36.610 --> 00:37:45.730
It is k x2, because
that one's positive,

00:37:45.730 --> 00:37:53.710
minus x1 plus b x2
dot minus x1 dot.

00:37:56.530 --> 00:38:00.200
And that has the signs right.

00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:04.250
And the whole key is just one at
a time assume positive motions

00:38:04.250 --> 00:38:06.220
and deduce what
happens, and then use

00:38:06.220 --> 00:38:10.330
the arrows, the direction of
the arrows, to set the signs.

00:38:10.330 --> 00:38:13.520
And now there's your
equation of motion.

00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:14.900
Now we can do the
same thing, sum

00:38:14.900 --> 00:38:29.800
of the forces on 2 in the x 2
direction, M2 x2 double dot.

00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:32.440
And now we would do
exactly the same thing.

00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:40.930
So positive motion of x1,
what does it do over here?

00:38:43.899 --> 00:38:46.315
It gives me a force through
the spring in which direction,

00:38:46.315 --> 00:38:47.476
positive or negative?

00:38:47.476 --> 00:38:48.316
AUDIENCE: Positive.

00:38:48.316 --> 00:38:49.690
PROFESSOR: Right,
so now you just

00:38:49.690 --> 00:38:56.980
end up with a kx1, bx1 dot.

00:38:56.980 --> 00:39:03.710
And you'll find
that kx2 bx2 dot.

00:39:03.710 --> 00:39:05.130
And you sum it up.

00:39:05.130 --> 00:39:12.080
And you'll end up-- this should
switch around, k x1 minus x2

00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:16.320
plus b x1 dot minus x2 dot.

00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:25.720
I've got two
equations of motion.

00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:26.530
And they're mixed.

00:39:26.530 --> 00:39:29.810
So each one has both
coordinates in it.

00:39:29.810 --> 00:39:33.090
So this problem has two
questions of motion,

00:39:33.090 --> 00:39:34.435
and they're coupled.

00:39:34.435 --> 00:39:35.435
They're not independent.

00:39:35.435 --> 00:39:37.870
You have to solve them together.

00:39:37.870 --> 00:39:41.400
OK, now we're going to
move on to a subject which

00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:43.070
has come up in conversation.

00:39:43.070 --> 00:39:44.820
People have asked about
this lots of time.

00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:50.470
And they say, what about
the centrifugal force?

00:39:50.470 --> 00:39:53.040
And you sometimes use the
term "fictitious force."

00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:59.150
How many of you use or heard the
word used "fictitious force"?

00:39:59.150 --> 00:40:07.580
And how many of you heard us say
that centripetal acceleration

00:40:07.580 --> 00:40:12.620
is not a force, it's
an acceleration?

00:40:12.620 --> 00:40:14.645
And yet we love to
talk about this concept

00:40:14.645 --> 00:40:19.840
of centrifugal force,
which doesn't exist.

00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:21.020
But it trips us all up.

00:40:21.020 --> 00:40:22.680
Because it's handy
to think about it.

00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:26.210
And so we're going to talk
about fictitious forces now.

00:40:38.730 --> 00:40:40.160
They're handy.

00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:42.370
But they are dangerous.

00:40:42.370 --> 00:40:44.680
You really have to
understand your fundamentals

00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:47.260
if you're going to use the
concept of fictitious forces

00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:49.640
without getting
yourself in trouble.

00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:52.220
OK, what is a fictitious force?

00:40:52.220 --> 00:40:57.800
Well, Newton's law, let's
start there, Newton's second.

00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:11.030
Sum of the forces
external on the body

00:41:11.030 --> 00:41:13.780
equals a mass
times acceleration.

00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:15.070
It's a vector equation.

00:41:15.070 --> 00:41:19.360
So we can break it down
into its components.

00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:57.935
So a fictitious force, you take
the true acceleration times

00:41:57.935 --> 00:41:58.435
the mass.

00:41:58.435 --> 00:42:00.060
So you have a fictitious force.

00:42:00.060 --> 00:42:08.660
It's going to multiply the true
acceleration times the mass

00:42:08.660 --> 00:42:25.540
and put it on the summation of
forces side of the equation.

00:42:29.320 --> 00:42:30.320
That's really all it is.

00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:33.160
And you move it over to
this side of the equation.

00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:35.620
And you think of it as a force.

00:42:35.620 --> 00:42:37.490
So what you've
done is you've said

00:42:37.490 --> 00:42:44.220
that the summation of the forces
minus Ma-- because to move it

00:42:44.220 --> 00:42:46.510
over here, you've got to
subtract it from this side--

00:42:46.510 --> 00:42:48.785
equals 0.

00:42:48.785 --> 00:42:50.160
And you're saying,
I'm just going

00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:51.830
to think of this as a force.

00:42:51.830 --> 00:42:57.010
And it makes this whole equation
be conveniently equal to 0.

00:42:57.010 --> 00:43:00.820
But now, that's
kind of abstract.

00:43:00.820 --> 00:43:04.506
Let's see if we can figure
out an example or two

00:43:04.506 --> 00:43:05.780
to illustrate this.

00:43:20.020 --> 00:43:22.030
I'm sure you've done
this problem in physics.

00:43:22.030 --> 00:43:23.905
I'm going to pick a
really elementary problem

00:43:23.905 --> 00:43:27.770
so you don't get hung up on
the physics to start with.

00:43:27.770 --> 00:43:29.315
This is the elevator problem.

00:43:29.315 --> 00:43:31.220
You've got cables pulling it up.

00:43:37.730 --> 00:43:40.450
You've got some scales in here,
and you're standing on it.

00:43:44.246 --> 00:43:45.370
Here's your center of mass.

00:43:45.370 --> 00:43:51.870
We'll call that A. And I
need a coordinate system,

00:43:51.870 --> 00:43:54.130
my inertial system.

00:43:54.130 --> 00:43:57.690
Newton's law only applies
in inertial systems.

00:43:57.690 --> 00:43:59.040
So here's my x.

00:43:59.040 --> 00:43:59.920
I called this z here.

00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:00.785
I'll call this y.

00:44:04.520 --> 00:44:06.710
So I need to write
an equation of motion

00:44:06.710 --> 00:44:10.260
about this person riding
up in the elevator.

00:44:12.976 --> 00:44:13.850
We take a look at it.

00:44:13.850 --> 00:44:15.016
How many degrees of freedom?

00:44:18.110 --> 00:44:20.824
Intuitively obvious--
it's probably how many?

00:44:20.824 --> 00:44:21.590
AUDIENCE: One.

00:44:21.590 --> 00:44:23.870
PROFESSOR: One-- all
sorts of constraints.

00:44:23.870 --> 00:44:25.400
It's only going up.

00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:27.720
So we're going to say we
need one degree of freedom.

00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:36.650
Free body diagrams--
well, this object

00:44:36.650 --> 00:44:40.430
has some force pushing up on it.

00:44:40.430 --> 00:44:42.040
This is the person.

00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:45.620
This is your mass.

00:44:45.620 --> 00:44:55.280
It has a force pulling
down on it, mg.

00:44:55.280 --> 00:44:58.089
And that's it.

00:44:58.089 --> 00:44:59.630
Now this N is going
to work out to be

00:44:59.630 --> 00:45:01.566
what the scales read, right?

00:45:01.566 --> 00:45:03.190
Because it's coming
through the scales.

00:45:03.190 --> 00:45:04.917
So that's really what
we're looking for.

00:45:11.130 --> 00:45:14.490
And the problem here is, define
the weight on the scales.

00:45:14.490 --> 00:45:22.290
So we say that the summation of
the forces in the y direction--

00:45:22.290 --> 00:45:25.390
and in this problem,
we would say

00:45:25.390 --> 00:45:28.960
it's the mass times the
acceleration of point

00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:37.390
A with respect to O.
And the sum of those

00:45:37.390 --> 00:45:45.530
forces-- you've
got an N minus mg.

00:45:45.530 --> 00:45:47.125
And that's a pretty
simple equation.

00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:53.630
Now I'm going to specify.

00:45:53.630 --> 00:46:02.000
It's given that acceleration
of A with respect to O

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:03.125
is 1/4 of g.

00:46:06.590 --> 00:46:08.790
So that's what the cables
in the elevator are doing.

00:46:08.790 --> 00:46:10.510
It's making this
thing move, and it's

00:46:10.510 --> 00:46:12.630
going up at 1/4 of g,
the N acceleration.

00:46:12.630 --> 00:46:14.290
So it's getting
faster and faster.

00:46:16.830 --> 00:46:30.400
OK, so if I solve this
for N, I will get--

00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:32.276
let me stop there for a second.

00:46:35.872 --> 00:46:37.330
It's normally what
I would just do.

00:46:37.330 --> 00:46:39.730
But since we're talking
about fictitious forces,

00:46:39.730 --> 00:46:42.830
I need to go through
that step for a second.

00:46:42.830 --> 00:46:45.035
So now I say that,
well, the summation

00:46:45.035 --> 00:46:54.300
of the forces in the y direction
here minus M acceleration of A

00:46:54.300 --> 00:47:00.200
with respect to O, that
total is equal to 0.

00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:13.090
And that then is N minus
Mg minus M times g over 4.

00:47:18.740 --> 00:47:24.960
And now I have taken
this upward acceleration.

00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:26.510
And I've treated
it like a force.

00:47:26.510 --> 00:47:28.850
I've just moved it
to this other side,

00:47:28.850 --> 00:47:30.890
set the whole thing equal to 0.

00:47:30.890 --> 00:47:32.655
This is the fictitious force.

00:47:39.224 --> 00:47:41.640
I'm going to say, OK, that's
all the forces in the system,

00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:50.210
solve for N. And of course you
get N is M times g plus g/4.

00:47:50.210 --> 00:47:54.290
And that's 5/4 mg.

00:47:54.290 --> 00:47:57.280
And so you read 25% heavier.

00:47:57.280 --> 00:47:58.530
It's a really trivial example.

00:47:58.530 --> 00:48:01.850
But the notion is
that you think of this

00:48:01.850 --> 00:48:03.730
as a force that's been applied.

00:48:03.730 --> 00:48:05.950
It's the mass times
acceleration with a minus

00:48:05.950 --> 00:48:06.920
sign in front of it.

00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:09.420
It'll always turn out like that.

00:48:09.420 --> 00:48:11.390
It's minus the mass
times the acceleration.

00:48:11.390 --> 00:48:16.190
Now, the acceleration can come
from Coriolis acceleration.

00:48:16.190 --> 00:48:19.740
It can come from
centripetal acceleration.

00:48:19.740 --> 00:48:21.650
So if we do this in
a rotating thing,

00:48:21.650 --> 00:48:25.850
this fictitious force might
be the centrifugal force,

00:48:25.850 --> 00:48:29.590
which is minus M times the
centripetal acceleration.

00:48:29.590 --> 00:48:31.748
And we'll do an
example like that.

00:48:43.973 --> 00:48:48.190
All right, stop-- there we go.

00:48:48.190 --> 00:48:49.920
OK, trivial example--
let's see if we can

00:48:49.920 --> 00:48:50.870
find something a little harder.

00:48:50.870 --> 00:48:51.950
How are we doing on time?

00:48:51.950 --> 00:48:53.470
We're doing pretty good.

00:48:53.470 --> 00:49:01.270
So let's do an example
where the notion is really

00:49:01.270 --> 00:49:02.800
quite powerful.

00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:05.990
Now, I showed you
this last time.

00:49:05.990 --> 00:49:09.180
And we talked a lot about--
we did the time derivative is

00:49:09.180 --> 00:49:10.080
the angular momentum.

00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:13.190
And we computed the
torques that this thing

00:49:13.190 --> 00:49:17.280
exerts around different
axes with respect

00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:18.890
to the point of
attachment to this.

00:49:18.890 --> 00:49:20.700
Well, this is an
example which, if you're

00:49:20.700 --> 00:49:22.400
comfortable with
fictitious forces,

00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:26.840
you can figure out those
torques really rather quickly.

00:49:26.840 --> 00:49:30.520
So I'm going to-- these
two problems are identical.

00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:33.880
This problem, or with a
shaft running like that,

00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:35.980
are really exactly identical.

00:49:35.980 --> 00:49:39.180
But I'm going to pretend that
my thing is made this way.

00:49:39.180 --> 00:49:41.440
Because it makes it easier
to see where these torques

00:49:41.440 --> 00:49:43.840
are coming from.

00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:45.660
So here's my z.

00:49:45.660 --> 00:49:48.760
And I've got my rotation
about the z-axis.

00:49:48.760 --> 00:49:52.942
Here's this mass,
my coordinates.

00:49:52.942 --> 00:49:56.740
Here's my r hat.

00:49:56.740 --> 00:50:01.550
Here's my z k hat, is
this distance here.

00:50:01.550 --> 00:50:10.050
And I'm going to set conditions
in the problem, my rotation

00:50:10.050 --> 00:50:10.990
rate.

00:50:10.990 --> 00:50:17.470
It's also theta dot
about the k z-axis.

00:50:17.470 --> 00:50:24.410
And omega dot, theta
double dot-- also in the k.

00:50:24.410 --> 00:50:25.270
It's not restricted.

00:50:25.270 --> 00:50:28.220
So I'm allowing this
thing to accelerate.

00:50:28.220 --> 00:50:32.810
But r dot equals
r double dot is 0.

00:50:32.810 --> 00:50:34.430
So it's not changing a position.

00:50:34.430 --> 00:50:36.180
It's just fixed.

00:50:36.180 --> 00:50:39.880
And I need to figure out
the forces on this thing

00:50:39.880 --> 00:50:43.150
and talk about how we
might consider some of them

00:50:43.150 --> 00:50:45.870
as fictitious forces.

00:50:45.870 --> 00:50:48.070
So let's think about
in the r direction--

00:50:48.070 --> 00:50:54.660
summation of the forces here
in this r hat direction.

00:50:54.660 --> 00:50:56.040
So it's one vector component.

00:50:56.040 --> 00:51:01.900
I don't have to carry along
all of the other baggage.

00:51:01.900 --> 00:51:08.946
It's equal to-- and
I'll call this B.

00:51:08.946 --> 00:51:10.900
This is going to be
the point about which I

00:51:10.900 --> 00:51:11.950
care about things.

00:51:11.950 --> 00:51:19.380
There's a fixed coordinate
system here, Oxyz.

00:51:19.380 --> 00:51:22.837
But then a rotating coordinate
system-- we'll call this A.

00:51:22.837 --> 00:51:24.420
And it's going to
have my coordinates.

00:51:24.420 --> 00:51:27.820
I'll use polar
coordinates, r theta z.

00:51:27.820 --> 00:51:28.930
But this one rotates.

00:51:28.930 --> 00:51:36.040
But it also has its origin
right there coincident with O.

00:51:36.040 --> 00:51:38.610
So the sum in the r
direction, then, we

00:51:38.610 --> 00:51:45.310
have the mass times
the acceleration of B

00:51:45.310 --> 00:51:50.670
with respect to O. And the
acceleration of B with respect

00:51:50.670 --> 00:51:56.440
to O is the
acceleration of-- we'll

00:51:56.440 --> 00:52:01.860
just write out the whole formula
using cylindrical coordinates.

00:52:07.570 --> 00:52:14.650
r double dot minus r theta dot
squared, this is in the r hat,

00:52:14.650 --> 00:52:24.170
plus r theta double
dot plus 2r dot theta

00:52:24.170 --> 00:52:26.570
dot in the theta hat direction.

00:52:26.570 --> 00:52:31.100
That's my full expression
for-- whoops, not quite full.

00:52:31.100 --> 00:52:34.430
Forgot a term, right?

00:52:34.430 --> 00:52:36.600
There we go.

00:52:36.600 --> 00:52:40.850
That's my full expression
for acceleration

00:52:40.850 --> 00:52:45.970
using cylindrical coordinates,
but with a moving,

00:52:45.970 --> 00:52:48.890
possibly translating and
rotating reference frame.

00:52:48.890 --> 00:52:50.998
This piece here counts for what?

00:52:54.910 --> 00:52:57.355
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:57.355 --> 00:52:58.822
PROFESSOR: Acceleration of what?

00:52:58.822 --> 00:53:01.756
In general, why do
we have that term?

00:53:01.756 --> 00:53:04.690
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:53:04.690 --> 00:53:07.310
PROFESSOR: It's the
translational acceleration

00:53:07.310 --> 00:53:08.629
of the A frame.

00:53:08.629 --> 00:53:09.670
So we can account for it.

00:53:09.670 --> 00:53:11.770
In this case, what is that?

00:53:11.770 --> 00:53:14.460
OK, so this term is 0.

00:53:14.460 --> 00:53:18.660
But this formula you
really need to know.

00:53:18.660 --> 00:53:21.190
Because it accounts for
all of the accelerations

00:53:21.190 --> 00:53:23.000
in the problem.

00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:24.770
You know that, you
just go in and start

00:53:24.770 --> 00:53:26.260
assigning, picking out things.

00:53:26.260 --> 00:53:27.144
What's this?

00:53:29.800 --> 00:53:30.720
0.

00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:32.440
Is this 0?

00:53:32.440 --> 00:53:34.960
No, how about this one?

00:53:34.960 --> 00:53:37.550
Not 0-- I'm allowing
it to accelerate.

00:53:37.550 --> 00:53:39.860
This one-- definitely 0.

00:53:39.860 --> 00:53:41.090
And this one?

00:53:41.090 --> 00:53:41.590
0.

00:53:41.590 --> 00:53:43.990
So I don't have many
terms left in this.

00:53:46.680 --> 00:53:59.721
So this then is the mass times
minus r theta dot squared.

00:53:59.721 --> 00:54:12.450
And this is r hat plus
r theta double dot

00:54:12.450 --> 00:54:15.420
in the theta hat direction.

00:54:15.420 --> 00:54:17.606
Now I said I was summing
the forces in the r.

00:54:24.360 --> 00:54:26.370
I put all of them
in at the moment.

00:54:29.430 --> 00:54:31.465
It may be smarter to do that.

00:54:31.465 --> 00:54:33.330
Let me reverse course here.

00:54:43.030 --> 00:54:47.710
This is the vector summation
of all the forces for a moment.

00:54:47.710 --> 00:54:53.140
And then we'll take
the r component next.

00:54:53.140 --> 00:54:55.670
So just the r
component, the summation

00:54:55.670 --> 00:55:01.000
of the forces in the
r, we look at this,

00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:07.830
and we say, oh, it's
just that minus Mr theta

00:55:07.830 --> 00:55:11.390
dot squared r hat.

00:55:11.390 --> 00:55:13.160
So that's the r direction.

00:55:13.160 --> 00:55:14.805
But now we need a
free body diagram.

00:55:18.670 --> 00:55:19.270
Yeah?

00:55:19.270 --> 00:55:23.570
AUDIENCE: Why did you take
the 2r theta [INAUDIBLE]?

00:55:23.570 --> 00:55:29.660
PROFESSOR: Oh, because
that's r dot 0.

00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:36.580
So in my r direction,
this is my acceleration.

00:55:36.580 --> 00:55:38.970
That's the only acceleration
in the r direction.

00:55:38.970 --> 00:55:41.790
It's what we know
to be centripetal.

00:55:41.790 --> 00:55:43.570
And the minus tells
us it's inward.

00:55:47.230 --> 00:55:49.560
Free body diagram-- need that.

00:55:52.810 --> 00:55:59.108
So looking-- a side view.

00:56:03.500 --> 00:56:04.430
Here's your bead.

00:56:07.580 --> 00:56:10.070
I'm going to draw it
as an unknown here.

00:56:10.070 --> 00:56:13.800
There is an unknown
force in the r direction

00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:18.480
that comes from
this bar holding it.

00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:20.940
It's applying-- there's
got to be a force that

00:56:20.940 --> 00:56:22.510
makes this go in a circle.

00:56:22.510 --> 00:56:24.070
And that bar is
what provides it.

00:56:24.070 --> 00:56:25.403
It's the only thing [INAUDIBLE].

00:56:25.403 --> 00:56:27.157
I'll just call
this unknown and r.

00:56:27.157 --> 00:56:29.240
And I'm just drawing it
in the positive direction.

00:56:29.240 --> 00:56:32.620
The way you can do this, if
you're not sure the direction,

00:56:32.620 --> 00:56:33.500
draw it positive.

00:56:33.500 --> 00:56:36.600
And the sign that
falls out tells you

00:56:36.600 --> 00:56:38.680
what the right answer is.

00:56:38.680 --> 00:56:42.740
There'll be some force in
the z provided by the rod.

00:56:42.740 --> 00:56:43.760
There'll be Mg.

00:56:46.540 --> 00:56:50.260
And that should be it.

00:56:50.260 --> 00:56:57.550
If we did a top
view, then there'd

00:56:57.550 --> 00:57:02.675
be an unknown in
the theta direction.

00:57:07.810 --> 00:57:11.590
You'd also see the N
in the r direction.

00:57:11.590 --> 00:57:12.480
And anything else?

00:57:12.480 --> 00:57:16.770
No, the Mg is down
where you can't see it.

00:57:16.770 --> 00:57:18.680
So these are your two
free body diagrams.

00:57:24.300 --> 00:57:32.680
So now, in this direction,
this is the acceleration.

00:57:32.680 --> 00:57:34.935
And the external
forces are just that.

00:57:37.790 --> 00:57:40.905
So the sum of the forces is Nr.

00:57:43.870 --> 00:57:48.180
Now I want to treat it,
bring in this concept

00:57:48.180 --> 00:57:49.410
of a fictitious force.

00:57:54.780 --> 00:57:56.992
I'm going to move
the acceleration

00:57:56.992 --> 00:57:57.950
term to the other side.

00:58:22.170 --> 00:58:24.640
Nr-- unknown positive.

00:58:24.640 --> 00:58:28.530
Now I'm going to move
that acceleration

00:58:28.530 --> 00:58:32.560
term over here minus--
ah, but now it's

00:58:32.560 --> 00:58:33.680
minus the acceleration.

00:58:36.490 --> 00:58:38.800
So this term looks like
that, has a minus sign.

00:58:38.800 --> 00:58:48.580
If you move it over here,
that actually becomes plus,

00:58:48.580 --> 00:58:49.295
equals 0.

00:58:51.930 --> 00:58:55.100
Now this is your
fictitious force.

00:59:03.719 --> 00:59:05.510
Sometimes people call
them inertial forces.

00:59:08.340 --> 00:59:13.500
And it acts like it's
pulling out on the object.

00:59:13.500 --> 00:59:20.490
So the force that the mass
appears to apply to the rod

00:59:20.490 --> 00:59:24.170
is this centrifugal
force pulling out.

00:59:24.170 --> 00:59:26.090
And of course now
we can solve for Nr.

00:59:26.090 --> 00:59:28.900
And we find it's minus Mr
theta dot squared, which

00:59:28.900 --> 00:59:29.870
we knew all along.

00:59:29.870 --> 00:59:33.750
It's the force applied
to the mass by the arm

00:59:33.750 --> 00:59:34.640
as it spins around.

00:59:34.640 --> 00:59:37.650
It has to pull in on it to
make it go in that circle.

00:59:40.170 --> 00:59:44.230
Now, we could do the same
thing in the theta direction.

00:59:44.230 --> 00:59:48.020
The theta direction will
have an Mr theta double dot.

00:59:48.020 --> 00:59:52.350
And when we look at the
theta free body diagram,

00:59:52.350 --> 00:59:53.920
it's plus N theta.

00:59:53.920 --> 00:59:55.650
You could solve that,
and you immediately

00:59:55.650 --> 01:00:02.152
come up with a solution for the
force in the theta direction.

01:00:02.152 --> 01:00:03.735
I'm just going to
write that one down.

01:00:11.460 --> 01:00:13.970
When you solve for this
one, you get a minus sign.

01:00:13.970 --> 01:00:19.430
This one ends up plus,
Mr theta double dot.

01:00:19.430 --> 01:00:22.660
I'm not going to go through the
gyrations of getting to this.

01:00:22.660 --> 01:00:25.170
You can do that one.

01:00:25.170 --> 01:00:30.646
Now, I want to do one
quick thing with this.

01:00:34.540 --> 01:00:40.400
Once you develop
confidence in knowing

01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:45.752
when you can use a fictitious
force and not get in trouble,

01:00:45.752 --> 01:00:47.377
this is the sort of
thing you might do.

01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:55.220
Here's my system.

01:00:55.220 --> 01:00:56.960
It's rotating.

01:00:56.960 --> 01:01:02.370
And I want a quick estimate
of, what's the torque?

01:01:02.370 --> 01:01:08.340
What's the bending moment about
this point caused by the fact

01:01:08.340 --> 01:01:11.660
that it is the
centripetal acceleration?

01:01:11.660 --> 01:01:14.180
Well, centripetal
acceleration is

01:01:14.180 --> 01:01:17.400
equivalent to having this
fictitious force outward

01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:25.820
on this of an amount
Mr theta dot squared.

01:01:25.820 --> 01:01:31.790
And this is the moment arm z.

01:01:31.790 --> 01:01:35.330
what's the torque that that
causes about this point?

01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:45.046
This is just levers now,
forces and lever arms.

01:01:45.046 --> 01:01:46.002
AUDIENCE: 0.

01:01:46.002 --> 01:01:48.680
PROFESSOR: No, not 0.

01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:50.910
About this point
here-- this is O.

01:01:50.910 --> 01:01:53.260
And I've got that
centrifugal force pulling out

01:01:53.260 --> 01:01:54.680
on this fictitious force.

01:01:54.680 --> 01:01:55.632
Yeah?

01:01:55.632 --> 01:01:57.445
AUDIENCE: zMR of
theta dot squared?

01:01:57.445 --> 01:02:01.993
PROFESSOR: Yeah, in
the-- this direction,

01:02:01.993 --> 01:02:03.870
which is theta, right?

01:02:03.870 --> 01:02:08.710
So that's the moment the
torque about this point caused

01:02:08.710 --> 01:02:16.860
by that-- torque at O is
minus Mr theta dot squared

01:02:16.860 --> 01:02:20.430
times z, the moment arm.

01:02:20.430 --> 01:02:23.192
And it's not minus.

01:02:23.192 --> 01:02:24.150
It's in that direction.

01:02:24.150 --> 01:02:25.676
So it's plus.

01:02:25.676 --> 01:02:29.190
It's in the theta hat
direction, the torque,

01:02:29.190 --> 01:02:31.940
that that force is
applying about this point.

01:02:35.580 --> 01:02:37.830
We could have solved
this problem the way

01:02:37.830 --> 01:02:41.300
we did in the last
lecture, very carefully

01:02:41.300 --> 01:02:45.660
going through the dh dt's
and following it all out.

01:02:45.660 --> 01:02:49.140
And we would have gotten
that answer for the torque

01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:50.827
except for a minus sign.

01:02:54.490 --> 01:02:57.640
Now, why the difference?

01:02:57.640 --> 01:03:00.900
This is the torque that
the centripetal force

01:03:00.900 --> 01:03:03.170
causes down here.

01:03:03.170 --> 01:03:08.050
When you do dh dt,
you get the torque

01:03:08.050 --> 01:03:12.516
required to make what's
happening happen.

01:03:15.780 --> 01:03:18.730
It's just the opposite.

01:03:18.730 --> 01:03:19.640
This is the torque.

01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:21.130
This is putting about that.

01:03:21.130 --> 01:03:23.730
There must be an equal
and opposite torque

01:03:23.730 --> 01:03:27.820
that this system puts
on this arm out here

01:03:27.820 --> 01:03:30.110
to keep it from flopping out.

01:03:30.110 --> 01:03:32.030
So this is applying
a torque here.

01:03:32.030 --> 01:03:33.960
It must resist with a torque.

01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:43.200
And so when you do
dh dt, you're going

01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:50.840
to end up with a minus Mr
theta dot squared theta hat.

01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:58.210
So you've got to be
careful what you mean.

01:03:58.210 --> 01:04:00.720
But from an engineering
point of view,

01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:02.930
if I were just trying to
calculate the bending moment

01:04:02.930 --> 01:04:06.030
down here and deciding whether
or not this shaft sticking out

01:04:06.030 --> 01:04:07.950
here is going to
break off or not,

01:04:07.950 --> 01:04:11.480
I could make a very quick
estimate of the bending moment

01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:14.785
by knowing this centrifugal
force times the moment arm.

01:04:14.785 --> 01:04:15.284
Yeah?

01:04:15.284 --> 01:04:21.190
AUDIENCE: Is that supposed to
be a z in the dh dt expression?

01:04:21.190 --> 01:04:24.190
Does there have to be
a z in that expression?

01:04:24.190 --> 01:04:25.508
PROFESSOR: A v, a velocity?

01:04:25.508 --> 01:04:26.464
AUDIENCE: A z.

01:04:26.464 --> 01:04:27.898
PROFESSOR: A z, yeah, right.

01:04:27.898 --> 01:04:32.708
I'm just getting a little
speedy in writing the equation.

01:04:32.708 --> 01:04:34.640
Good catch.

01:04:34.640 --> 01:04:41.110
All right, so now, we also have
a theta direction thing here,

01:04:41.110 --> 01:04:42.840
right?

01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:46.820
We can think of a fictitious
force in the theta direction.

01:04:46.820 --> 01:04:49.650
And that was the Mr
theta double dot term.

01:04:49.650 --> 01:04:55.980
Does it generate torques that
you could quickly compute?

01:04:55.980 --> 01:04:58.570
So as this thing is
trying to accelerate

01:04:58.570 --> 01:05:02.380
in the positive acceleration,
omega dot, theta double dot,

01:05:02.380 --> 01:05:04.730
it's trying to accelerate
into the board.

01:05:04.730 --> 01:05:07.490
The bar is having to push
that thing into the board.

01:05:07.490 --> 01:05:10.580
There's a force in the
positive theta hat direction.

01:05:10.580 --> 01:05:15.630
But the fictitious
inertial force

01:05:15.630 --> 01:05:22.190
is the mass pushing back on
the rod, pushing this way,

01:05:22.190 --> 01:05:25.740
Mr theta double dot
pushing this way.

01:05:25.740 --> 01:05:28.170
What moments does that
cause about this point?

01:05:33.742 --> 01:05:34.658
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:05:40.125 --> 01:05:42.380
PROFESSOR: So there's
actually two moment arms.

01:05:42.380 --> 01:05:46.730
If you have a force this
way now, the force in,

01:05:46.730 --> 01:05:48.550
I'll call it, the
theta direction

01:05:48.550 --> 01:05:53.240
is Mr theta double dot.

01:05:53.240 --> 01:05:56.436
Now, this is my
fictitious force.

01:05:56.436 --> 01:05:58.010
This is this fictitious force.

01:05:58.010 --> 01:06:00.900
It's in the minus
theta hat direction.

01:06:00.900 --> 01:06:04.330
It's pushing back.

01:06:04.330 --> 01:06:08.090
It's in the minus theta hat
direction, Mr theta double dot.

01:06:08.090 --> 01:06:15.920
And a torque is some R
cross with the force.

01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:23.922
And this R is that, RBA.

01:06:23.922 --> 01:06:31.930
And it's composed of r
R hat and z k hat here.

01:06:31.930 --> 01:06:37.300
So we have to do
a little r r hat

01:06:37.300 --> 01:06:51.950
plus z k hat crossed with minus
Mr theta double dot theta hat.

01:06:51.950 --> 01:06:55.460
So you get an r hat cross
theta gives you a k.

01:06:55.460 --> 01:06:58.085
A k cross theta
hat gives you an r.

01:06:58.085 --> 01:07:01.650
You're going to get
two terms out of this.

01:07:01.650 --> 01:07:07.130
One is going to look like
Mr squared theta double dot.

01:07:07.130 --> 01:07:09.400
And that's a torque.

01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:13.150
And that is the one that
it takes to-- that's

01:07:13.150 --> 01:07:16.680
the torque about this axis.

01:07:16.680 --> 01:07:19.780
There's a force times
this moment arm.

01:07:19.780 --> 01:07:21.260
That's a torque about this axis.

01:07:21.260 --> 01:07:23.730
That's the actual torque it
takes to speed this thing up.

01:07:26.640 --> 01:07:30.860
And then there's a torque
about this axis, which is

01:07:30.860 --> 01:07:34.320
this length times this force.

01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:35.830
And that's the other term.

01:07:35.830 --> 01:07:40.800
That'll give you the
term in the R direction.

01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:41.750
It'll be a twist.

01:07:41.750 --> 01:07:44.380
It'll be trying to twist
this bar like that.

01:07:44.380 --> 01:07:46.570
Because there's a force
in this direction.

01:07:46.570 --> 01:07:47.780
Yeah.

01:07:47.780 --> 01:07:49.700
AUDIENCE: It seems
like these forces

01:07:49.700 --> 01:07:52.580
are coming from the systems.

01:07:52.580 --> 01:07:54.980
They aren't even fictitious.

01:07:54.980 --> 01:08:02.080
PROFESSOR: So she's asking,
it's like the forces are real.

01:08:02.080 --> 01:08:06.510
But the force-- I
mean, this is why

01:08:06.510 --> 01:08:11.030
fictitious forces, this concept
of them, is so dangerous.

01:08:11.030 --> 01:08:14.870
It's because it's
really tempting

01:08:14.870 --> 01:08:17.620
to start thinking of
them like real forces.

01:08:17.620 --> 01:08:22.500
So any time you get stuck,
you go back to the basics.

01:08:22.500 --> 01:08:26.830
And you say, Newton's
law, F equals ma,

01:08:26.830 --> 01:08:30.605
you see torques is dh dt
plus that v cross p term

01:08:30.605 --> 01:08:31.630
if you need it.

01:08:31.630 --> 01:08:37.100
And you work it out carefully
using all the vector math.

01:08:37.100 --> 01:08:40.529
And then you are
dealing-- and then

01:08:40.529 --> 01:08:47.779
Coriolis, centripetal, Euler
terms are only accelerations.

01:08:47.779 --> 01:08:49.779
You treat them as
pure accelerations.

01:08:49.779 --> 01:08:50.850
That's all they are.

01:08:53.580 --> 01:09:01.790
Now, to cause accelerations,
you need to apply forces.

01:09:01.790 --> 01:09:05.160
And we give these forces names.

01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:07.350
Because it's
helpful conceptually

01:09:07.350 --> 01:09:11.080
to think about these
things as forces sometimes.

01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:14.445
But they are not real forces.

01:09:17.490 --> 01:09:19.795
But it's quick and easy.

01:09:19.795 --> 01:09:21.819
If you get too
comfortable with them,

01:09:21.819 --> 01:09:24.760
they are great assets
to your intuition.

01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:26.870
So I know immediately
just looking

01:09:26.870 --> 01:09:30.420
at this thing, as soon
as I see a machine that

01:09:30.420 --> 01:09:35.470
has a part that rotates like
this, I say, rotational motion.

01:09:35.470 --> 01:09:41.920
That's central, circular
motion, must be the equivalent

01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:45.290
of a centrifugal force.

01:09:45.290 --> 01:09:48.000
This mass is going to
pull in that direction.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:49.770
Because it's going
around and around.

01:09:49.770 --> 01:09:51.960
And it's going to cause a
moment about this thing.

01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:54.326
I know for sure that's
got to be there.

01:09:54.326 --> 01:09:56.080
And if I'm going to
do it rigorously,

01:09:56.080 --> 01:09:57.960
I call it centripetal
acceleration.

01:09:57.960 --> 01:09:59.040
And I compute.

01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:03.390
It's really the force that
this bar puts on that mass

01:10:03.390 --> 01:10:07.010
to make it go in a circle.

01:10:07.010 --> 01:10:09.200
But it's handy to
think of it as a force

01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:12.760
if what I'm interested
in is the force.

01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:17.210
The other even better-- let's
go back to the old really simple

01:10:17.210 --> 01:10:18.670
demonstration.

01:10:18.670 --> 01:10:21.920
This thing going
around constant speed,

01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:23.930
there's definitely a
tension in the string.

01:10:23.930 --> 01:10:25.100
And I am pulling.

01:10:25.100 --> 01:10:27.690
The tension is inward, right?

01:10:27.690 --> 01:10:31.230
That tension causes
an acceleration

01:10:31.230 --> 01:10:33.780
of r theta dot squared.

01:10:33.780 --> 01:10:37.440
And that acceleration is inward.

01:10:37.440 --> 01:10:39.220
But it's easy.

01:10:39.220 --> 01:10:42.860
If you ask me, come
on, Kim, quick,

01:10:42.860 --> 01:10:45.760
tell me, what's the
tension in the string,

01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:49.000
I just say, that's easy--
Mr theta dot squared,

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:50.050
centrifugal force.

01:10:59.230 --> 01:11:00.010
They're handy.

01:11:00.010 --> 01:11:04.550
But any time you get stuck,
go back and be really strict

01:11:04.550 --> 01:11:06.810
and say, what's acceleration?

01:11:06.810 --> 01:11:09.650
And what's real external forces?

01:11:09.650 --> 01:11:13.330
Gravity is an external force.

01:11:13.330 --> 01:11:16.580
The force that the bar puts on
the mass, that's a real force.

01:11:16.580 --> 01:11:20.040
But these other things
are just accelerations.

01:11:20.040 --> 01:11:23.030
All right, OK, hey, perfect.

01:11:23.030 --> 01:11:25.400
I didn't get to the thing
I really wanted to do.

01:11:25.400 --> 01:11:26.400
So I'll do it next time.

01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:29.027
And I'm going to
show you this thing.

01:11:29.027 --> 01:11:30.860
And I want you to fill
out your muddy cards.

01:11:30.860 --> 01:11:32.960
I'm giving you a couple minutes.

01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:35.755
So this is a mechanical shaker.

01:11:35.755 --> 01:11:37.300
You see it moving already.

01:11:37.300 --> 01:11:42.720
And we're going to talk
about that next time.
