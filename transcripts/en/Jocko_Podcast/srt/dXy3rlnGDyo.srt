00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,040
This is Jocko podcast
number one 86 with me,

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:05,390
Jocko Willink.

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:12,510
Among the newly minted
Special Forces soldiers were

4
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:18,240
Douglas El Latino, a skinny hundred
and 35 pound California cowboy,

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,000
John Shore, a blonde haired,

6
00:00:21,001 --> 00:00:26,001
slightly overweight baby faced kid
from Georgia and frank mccloskey,

7
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:30,510
a tough combat hardened veteran of
the a hundred first airborne division.

8
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:35,520
Mccloskey arrived sporting seepage
from a wound in the back of his head.

9
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:40,590
This trio of green berets had completed
their special forces in country training

10
00:00:40,591 --> 00:00:44,190
program and not train the Fifth
Special Forces Group headquarters.

11
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:49,200
When a sergeant not training asked for
Special Forces soldiers to volunteer for

12
00:00:49,201 --> 00:00:50,850
a secret project,

13
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:54,300
they raised their hands in short order.

14
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,600
They were flown to fob four in the
northern sector of South Vietnam.

15
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,150
ICORE upon reporting in,

16
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:08,130
they were told Camp Commander Colonel
Jack Warren would brief them in the

17
00:01:08,131 --> 00:01:11,970
morning on the CNC
mission in Southeast Asia.

18
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:17,610
Finally, after more than a
year of training for Laterno,

19
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:21,150
the game was on how much
better could this get?

20
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:26,190
It seems all his life he'd been preparing
for this moment from riding rodeo

21
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,590
Bronx and breaking nearly
every bone in his body.

22
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:33,710
To wrangling animals for television
shows like Dak Tare and cowboy in Africa

23
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:35,310
starring Chuck Connors.

24
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:39,690
Laterno knew a little bit
about taking a calculated risk.

25
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:41,580
Okay.

26
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:46,170
And after he had gotten his hands on
Robin Moore's book, the Green Berets,

27
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:50,190
he knew this was for him.
Guerrilla warfare. Check,

28
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,000
counterinsurgency training,
check unconventional warfare,

29
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,800
check return. Oh,

30
00:01:55,801 --> 00:02:00,750
couldn't wait to write his own story that
he could someday share with his dad a

31
00:02:00,751 --> 00:02:05,730
world war to be 17 pilot and former POW.

32
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:07,741
Nothing,

33
00:02:07,741 --> 00:02:11,400
however could have prepared him for the
site that greeted him as he entered the

34
00:02:11,401 --> 00:02:16,401
transient barracks there etched onto
the concrete floor and forever in his

35
00:02:16,681 --> 00:02:19,710
memory was the chart
outline of a man's body,

36
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:23,490
a grizzly reminder of the 23 August,

37
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:27,090
1968 attack on fob for
that fateful evening,

38
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:31,920
north Vietnamese sappers and Vietcong
operatives killed 18 green berets in a

39
00:02:31,921 --> 00:02:34,110
carefully executed sneak attack.

40
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:39,450
The deadly side of gorilla warfare
was brought home to him right there.

41
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:44,580
He was in a war zone. The enemy
didn't play by any set rules.

42
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:49,960
It was an unsettling event. The
next morning after breakfast,

43
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:52,600
the trio walked over to s three
and chose their code names.

44
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:57,790
The Tourneau mccloskey and shore
now became the Frenchmen, nam, Mu,

45
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:01,960
and bubba names that would stick with
them far beyond their tours of duty in

46
00:03:01,961 --> 00:03:06,961
Vietnam because S3 was temporarily
located in the headquarters section of fob

47
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:09,371
four since the attack,

48
00:03:09,371 --> 00:03:12,130
it was a quick shuffle into the
briefing room with everyone else,

49
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:14,163
an intense short,

50
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,640
an intense short black haired man wearing
pajamas slippers and a bathrobe walked

51
00:03:19,751 --> 00:03:23,350
in smoking a cigarette
before a word was spoken.

52
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:28,150
Colonel Warren abruptly pulled a white
sheet off a large map with a flourish and

53
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:30,280
tossed it aside and announced.

54
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Welcome to C and C men turning to the
large map that had black tape boxed

55
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:39,910
target, deadly designators on in Laos,

56
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:44,950
the DMZ and north Vietnam. He continued.
This is what you volunteered for.

57
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,120
This is why this is a top
secret project. If anybody asks,

58
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:52,180
the president can say, we have
no men stationed in the AOE.

59
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:57,730
That is why you'll wear sterile fatigues
and carry no form of identification of

60
00:03:57,731 --> 00:03:59,440
any kind on your missions.

61
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:04,120
That's why you agreed not to talk
to anyone about this operation.

62
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,980
For at least 20 years,

63
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:12,040
our Intel reports land in the
White House. Any questions?

64
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,260
Not Waiting for a response.

65
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,950
Warn continued to explain the difference
between spike teams and hatchet force

66
00:04:17,951 --> 00:04:21,220
elements where the
different fops were located.

67
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:26,460
How fob three at case on was closed after
the siege earlier in the year and how

68
00:04:26,621 --> 00:04:31,621
major Clyde's sincere jr had opened a
site at my lock now designated fob three

69
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,260
following an update on intelligence
reports in the respective areas of

70
00:04:38,261 --> 00:04:41,770
operations. Colonel Warren asked
if anyone had any questions.

71
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:46,780
The turno raised his hand.
Where do you need help, sir?

72
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:53,130
We need men at fob one we lost a one
zero on October 5th and some of the first

73
00:04:53,471 --> 00:04:57,460
special forces, TDY troops from Okinawa
are returning back to the island,

74
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:03,040
the turnoff short turn to shore and
mccloskey and asked, how about it fob?

75
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:07,600
One shore nodded in the
affirmative. Mccloskey said, no,

76
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:11,320
I think I'll stay here. Latino
turned back to Warren and said,

77
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,470
we'll go nodding towards
shore. Surprised at mccloskey.

78
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:17,230
His response without missing a beat.

79
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:21,010
Warren told the remainder of the SF troops
in the room that he'd be right back.

80
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,950
He turned to Latino and
shore and said, follow me.

81
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,070
As he headed out of the briefing room
and into the s three operation center,

82
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:30,250
he told the center staff
to get a king, beat a fob,

83
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:35,170
four in an hour to transport
Latino and short to fob one asap.

84
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:41,250
Next he headed to s one and told the clerk
that the newbies were to be processed

85
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:44,770
and cleared to go to
food by an hour later,

86
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,440
PFC Latino and Spec for shore.

87
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:52,060
We're in a King B heading north to fob one

88
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,070
and that right there is an excerpt,

89
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:00,080
the book across the fence
which was written by

90
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:04,190
John Stryker Meyer nickname tilt,

91
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:09,480
who is a special forces soldier and
saga recon leader in Vietnam and we went

92
00:06:09,741 --> 00:06:14,741
deep with tilts on podcast one 81 81 and
one 82 and if you haven't listened to

93
00:06:15,951 --> 00:06:19,220
those podcasts and stop this one right
now and go back and listen to those

94
00:06:19,221 --> 00:06:20,054
first.

95
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:24,770
But if you have already listened to
those podcasts and you heard a little bit

96
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:30,130
about Doug Latino code name the
Frenchman and you know that he was also a

97
00:06:31,161 --> 00:06:35,600
special forces soldier at Green Baret
and it was also a SOG team member in

98
00:06:35,601 --> 00:06:40,601
Vietnam and it is an absolute honor to
have not only tilt back again on this

99
00:06:42,051 --> 00:06:46,490
podcast, but he brought
with him the man himself.

100
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,410
Doug Laterno. [inaudible]
gentlemen, thank you for coming on.

101
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:55,490
Good to see you again. Good evening sir.
Good evening. Thank you for having us.

102
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:59,840
They had great tribute to your, great
to have you both here and um, yeah.

103
00:06:59,841 --> 00:07:02,850
Let's talk a little bit about how you
ended up there. I mean we, you glow,

104
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:05,780
you glaze over in the book.
We're, we're riding Rodeo Broncos.

105
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:07,820
We're working in Hollywood,
taming and animals.

106
00:07:07,821 --> 00:07:11,090
What was your upbringing that
got you to, that got you there.

107
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,400
Believe it or not, I was
born east la in the Barrio.

108
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:19,860
Well that makes sense.
Yeah, not, yeah, I know. No.

109
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:23,210
So living in the city.

110
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:27,110
I got fortunate enough when
I got into high school,

111
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:30,920
then I got into a program called
the future farmers of America.

112
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:34,010
And it gave me a whole different
way of looking at life.

113
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:37,970
And I ended up becoming a
president of the chapter,

114
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:42,470
but I had several Spanish
speaking in Spanish,

115
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:47,060
people in our chapter, one of the
largest in all of southern California.

116
00:07:47,061 --> 00:07:50,240
As it turned out, well with these people,

117
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:55,840
I could became such good friends and
their way of life in still working in the

118
00:07:56,691 --> 00:08:01,130
fields of the San Fernando
valley, which was still open. Uh,

119
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:05,420
I tended to lean towards
the country way of life,

120
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:07,700
even though I was born
and raised in the city.

121
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:13,100
And I do nothing about
anything at all but city life.

122
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:18,580
But I tried to break away
from that through the
organization and the western end

123
00:08:19,281 --> 00:08:24,020
of the San Fernando Valley.
Well, one thing led to another,

124
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:29,320
and I learned about you could go rodeo
and there was a place that I could go

125
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:32,330
ride in practice.

126
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:36,990
We could do bull riding and bronc
riding and bareback riding and, uh,

127
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:40,460
all the three w [inaudible]
San Fernando Valley.

128
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:45,470
This was actually out in thousand
oaks at the paramount studios. Okay.

129
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:48,150
Yeah. They had a ranch
right there. And, uh,

130
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:52,260
w d coopers is what it was
called in those days. And, uh,

131
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:56,280
we could go out on Wednesday night
and Saturday and Sunday and ride

132
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:01,440
and have jackpots. And I got into it
and then one thing led to another.

133
00:09:01,441 --> 00:09:06,240
I got into college and I got on the
college inner collegiate team and we

134
00:09:06,241 --> 00:09:10,660
traveled and rodeoed. And, and
as I went through college, uh,

135
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:15,740
I became adept to it and got into roping
with roping horses and own my own rope

136
00:09:17,161 --> 00:09:21,960
horse. And it just, the way of life
changed from being a city slicker to a,

137
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:24,570
to a cowboy. Where'd you go to college?

138
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:29,550
I started out at Pierce Junior
College at the, in Woodland Hills,

139
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:31,200
San Fernando Valley,

140
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:36,770
and then ended up with cal
poly San Luis Obispo mustangs.

141
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,920
So it through courses there. And, uh,

142
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:43,730
but basically, uh,

143
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:47,370
we just just kept on going. And then

144
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:54,150
with the TV series is we're
popular when a lot of animals,

145
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:58,620
there was an opening to be a
wild animal trainer at Africa,

146
00:09:58,621 --> 00:10:02,880
USA in San Canyon. Newhall.
So I jumped up there.

147
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,120
How old are you at this point? I'm nine.

148
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:09,120
I'm 20 and while the animal
trainers sounds like, you know,

149
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,530
you're talking another day
in college. There you go.

150
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:15,600
So I jumped up there and before I
knew it I was handling Clarence,

151
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,670
the cross sided line and Judy the chimp.

152
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:23,130
And then they had a rope horse there
that they used and they wanted me to call

153
00:10:23,131 --> 00:10:27,690
Dakota Duke and they wanted me to go out
and capture all these animals by roping

154
00:10:27,691 --> 00:10:29,760
them. And they knew I could rope.

155
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:34,650
There's actual picture of me on the
front of the pigging string that was

156
00:10:34,651 --> 00:10:36,300
produced out of Lancaster,

157
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:40,740
Antelope Valley of me on the
front cover of roping a tiger,

158
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:45,000
often this off of words off this
horse. And that's what I did.

159
00:10:45,001 --> 00:10:48,630
And I wrote the elephants and
I wrote, you know, healed them,

160
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:50,370
healed giraffes.

161
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:55,440
And I headed up White Rhino
Forum and that was coming at us.

162
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,570
And I turned them back and you know,
where they, they would do all these, uh,

163
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:05,130
what they call a veil avail. It'd be
open land. It's a, it's an African term.

164
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:09,480
And, uh, we just, uh, would
turn these animals loose,

165
00:11:09,481 --> 00:11:14,070
but somebody had to go get them. So
I, I actually got to work on the,

166
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:17,730
on the TV series that was
very popular, called doc tare.

167
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:22,440
And people would see the
trucks, they were zebra trucks.

168
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:26,430
I went on Youtube and checked
out some doc tare, own footage,

169
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:31,440
classic show really. And uh,
but it was shot in like Africa,

170
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:34,770
but actually it was all done right
there in New Orleans songs, you know,

171
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:40,020
the compound. And so from there, uh,

172
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:44,130
we ran into a series called the
cowboy in Africa and we brought chuck,

173
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:48,440
Chuck Connors in it. And uh,
he was the star. And, uh,

174
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:51,510
Hugh O'Brian had actually
done the original movie.

175
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:55,390
There's of cowboy in Africa
and they shot it in Africa,

176
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:58,980
but here they are going to shoot it
here in the United States. And, uh,

177
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:02,920
so I got to work with ostriches and all
kinds of different animals that they had

178
00:12:02,921 --> 00:12:03,754
to have around the,

179
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:08,770
the compound of the House that he
was working out of in the series.

180
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:13,360
But one thing led to another.
But as it turned out, uh,

181
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:17,320
one night somebody handed
me an old ragged book,

182
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:18,763
it's called the Greenbrae,

183
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:23,990
but Robin Moore and I looked at it and
read it and I couldn't put it down.

184
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:26,343
And I said,

185
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:31,720
this has got to be something that this
Vietnam War's been going on for quite a

186
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:34,300
while. I grew up almost
listening to it every day.

187
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:39,900
There's gotta be something going on that
I need to contribute and I think this

188
00:12:39,911 --> 00:12:44,830
is what I want to do. I went down the
next day, very next day, and signed up.

189
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:50,020
What year was that and how old were
you? I was 20 and this was, uh,

190
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:55,280
like a September, just
before it was like, well,

191
00:12:55,830 --> 00:13:00,580
I say, cause I went in September
1st so it was the day before.

192
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:04,990
So August, you know, August 30th.

193
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:07,450
What year though? 1968.

194
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,110
1960 67 67 years.

195
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:16,620
And I actually entered the
service in of September 1st,

196
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:17,520
1967.

197
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:22,410
Yeah. By that time he had
obtained a college degree
by tending classes at night.

198
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:26,340
So instead of going through to four year
program, the college of three years,

199
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:30,150
well I graduated when I was 17,
from high school, from high school.

200
00:13:30,151 --> 00:13:34,800
Guy was early into classes at
night. Yeah. As spare time. And,

201
00:13:34,801 --> 00:13:36,120
and like the,

202
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:40,920
the attitude towards the
Vietnam War in 1967, you know,

203
00:13:40,921 --> 00:13:44,630
from the, I mean, spread when
we think a Hollywood now we,

204
00:13:44,631 --> 00:13:47,040
we think of people that
just are, you know,

205
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,550
just detest everything that has to do
with the military most of the time.

206
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:53,940
And you were kind of in that Hollywood
scene hanging around with all these

207
00:13:53,941 --> 00:13:56,100
people, but that didn't
rub off on you at all.

208
00:13:56,390 --> 00:14:00,380
It didn't happen that way in 67, 68.

209
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:02,300
It wasn't like that back then.

210
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:07,470
I was shocked when I got
back and I actually, uh,

211
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:12,200
visited Bubba in on
Peach Street in Atlanta,

212
00:14:12,201 --> 00:14:16,820
Georgia. And there was a anti, uh,

213
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:20,150
rally Vietnam rally going down the street.

214
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:23,810
And I looked out the window and I
said, Bubba, what in the world is that?

215
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,700
He says, those are anti war
protesters. I'd never seen it,

216
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:31,130
never heard of it. But in 67,

217
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:36,230
everybody was still pretty patriotic.
Got and didn't have that situation.

218
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:41,580
And, and now what about your
old man who was, you know, he,

219
00:14:41,581 --> 00:14:45,680
he was, you were raised as a son of
a guy that was a [inaudible] pilot.

220
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:50,290
Yes. A, a war hero in itself. He was,

221
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:51,860
he ran 13 missions.

222
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:57,070
He was actually the first two
missions in were over Berlin.

223
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,890
He was on the first two missions
that bomb Berlin itself,

224
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:05,660
but he flew 13 missions
on his 13th mission.

225
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:07,100
Uh,

226
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:11,030
they gave him a brand new airplane because
his airplane had been shot up so bad

227
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:16,040
with his crew that he brought from the
United States and flew it over to England

228
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:18,890
that they had to give him a
brand new airplane that morning.

229
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:23,210
And he took off and he
had 999 planes behind him.

230
00:15:23,211 --> 00:15:28,211
He was point that day and he went
over a target called Schweinfurth.

231
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,560
As it turned out,

232
00:15:30,561 --> 00:15:35,561
Schweinfurth in four in 44 had lost
56 airplanes and this day his entire

233
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:44,471
squadron of 22 out of 23 where
to be shot down that day.

234
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:50,380
And he was the first one down and they
were using new tactics the Nazis were

235
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:54,200
with. They would line up, uh,

236
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:58,970
Mr Smith's and one oh nines and, uh,

237
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:04,360
in a row and go right through them instead
of coming around or calling on top,

238
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,780
they'd just go right through them.

239
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:08,480
They didn't care if they
lost the planes or not.

240
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:13,960
And then they had a folk with one
nineties behind them and they took out all

241
00:16:15,921 --> 00:16:20,480
these planes in the very lead
just to start the battle.

242
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:25,850
But no one could ever figure out why
Schweinfurth was so protected and so many

243
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:30,851
losses every time it was tried to be
bombed and Garrick during the Nuremberg

244
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:32,114
trials,

245
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:37,750
he admitted that it was the only ball
bearing factory the Germans owned without

246
00:16:38,211 --> 00:16:41,600
ball-bearings. A war would have been
over with in a matter of a few months.

247
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:47,380
And this whole war went on and on and on
because neither the British or the u s

248
00:16:47,421 --> 00:16:49,460
could figure, figure that out.

249
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,130
And they should have bobbed
it every day is what he said.

250
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:55,910
And if the war would've been over
with, they would have had to surrender.

251
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:59,090
But just the cork in the whole situation.

252
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:04,360
But my dad ended up being
my first airborne person in
our family in voluntarily

253
00:17:06,681 --> 00:17:07,514
in the fall of two.

254
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:12,730
And Halo told themselves one altitude
when they find that 10,000 feet when he

255
00:17:13,581 --> 00:17:17,750
jumped because his plane caught on
fire and they couldn't extinguish it.

256
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:21,260
His engines were on fire and he
couldn't open the Bombay doors.

257
00:17:21,261 --> 00:17:23,390
The hydraulic system had been shot up.

258
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:28,630
He'd lost his radio operator had a a 20
millimeter right through his stomach and

259
00:17:29,001 --> 00:17:33,800
they had to put a parachute on him and
just shoving him out the bottom door.

260
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:39,020
And, uh, it was pretty, pretty
hectic. The plane blew up in mid air,

261
00:17:39,021 --> 00:17:44,021
but those that could got out and made
the free fall to the ground and I'll pull

262
00:17:46,741 --> 00:17:49,770
their shoots. And, uh, anyway,

263
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,980
my dad was attacked by
farmers with pitchforks.

264
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:58,400
And thank God that Gestapo and the ss
were there to retrieve him and push the

265
00:18:01,321 --> 00:18:04,590
farmers back. He thought he was
gonna die right there in the hole.

266
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:09,120
He sprained his ankle and he was kind
of out of it. And, uh, but anyway,

267
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:13,560
they hauled him off and strung him up
and tried to make him talk and you know,

268
00:18:13,561 --> 00:18:16,290
the usual serial number, name and rank.

269
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:20,010
And then they put him install log one,

270
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:25,190
which was an all officer camp and had
15,000 officers that had been shot down in

271
00:18:27,061 --> 00:18:27,894
that camp.

272
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:33,050
All the enlisted men went to enlisted
stall logs and he served 13 months in the

273
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:38,190
POW camp. And then one morning they
woke up and the Russians were there,

274
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,650
the Russians liberated them. And, uh,

275
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:47,130
he was taken home. And
that's the story. And,

276
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:48,600
and uh,

277
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:53,600
he became well known for in
our town for what he did.

278
00:18:55,920 --> 00:19:00,920
Plus he had two brothers and my uncle
Arman was given a silver star by Patton,

279
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:04,680
General Patton himself in
France, pinned [inaudible] chest.

280
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:08,050
And my uncle Eddie flew corsairs or

281
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:14,400
so the Latino brothers were quite active.
They were. So I had a lot to follow.

282
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:20,460
Jeez. So I ran, I ran 13 missions.

283
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:26,130
How Ironic, right. I ran 13
missions and one bright light.

284
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,700
W when your dad came home, what did he
do? When did he get out of the army?

285
00:19:30,701 --> 00:19:34,420
Did He, well it was the army air corps
in those days. It wasn't the air force.

286
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:37,840
And uh, so he, he uh,

287
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:42,160
he tried doing a little bartending
and a little this, a little of that,

288
00:19:42,161 --> 00:19:45,640
but he had been in construction.
He actually partnered up with,

289
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:47,650
is it my grandfather? My,

290
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:51,550
my grandparents and it was Latino
and Latino construction company.

291
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,590
And uh, he,

292
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:54,790
okay.

293
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:59,140
Filtered back into the construction and
started building because they needed

294
00:19:59,141 --> 00:20:01,420
homes, every, all of these
soldiers coming home.

295
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:06,220
And he built most of the Burbank
and Glendale at the time. And uh,

296
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:10,660
they did always did quite well and
got into commercial buildings and,

297
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:11,830
and uh,

298
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:16,830
I sort of followed into those footsteps
eventually after I got back from the

299
00:20:16,931 --> 00:20:20,680
service. So when you, when
you enlisted, what did you,

300
00:20:20,681 --> 00:20:22,840
how did your dad feel about that? Well,

301
00:20:22,841 --> 00:20:27,670
he was not happy about it cause
he only gave him a day's notice.

302
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,550
I said, I'm going,

303
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:34,270
I'm going into the service and I'm going
to go to Vietnam and I'm going to be a

304
00:20:34,271 --> 00:20:38,770
green baret. But of course when we and
I enlisted, they couldn't give me that.

305
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:43,780
It was the only mos, uh, that
they could not give because a,

306
00:20:43,781 --> 00:20:46,630
it wasn't guaranteed. They could
guarantee me anything else.

307
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:50,380
They wanted to be an officer because
I had a degree and I said, no,

308
00:20:50,381 --> 00:20:52,660
I'm not going to go to ocs. I want to,

309
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:57,010
I want to go and be whatever it
takes to be in special forces.

310
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:59,860
As it turned out in the long run,

311
00:20:59,861 --> 00:21:04,740
whether you really want to hear the
whole story, it's up to you. But, uh,

312
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:11,340
I did end up being a green baret and
going through all the processes and going

313
00:21:12,011 --> 00:21:17,011
through all the volunteer
and being accepted and going
into it and I passed it.

314
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:23,440
But during that time, I'm, you have
to realize I'm just an [inaudible].

315
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:26,020
I went in as an [inaudible].
I'm an [inaudible].

316
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:29,910
I'm the lowest ranking there is. And,

317
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:35,730
and the Mos that I actually graduated
with was a prized mos that only a few

318
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:42,280
would maintain and that was
heavy weapons. And they go,

319
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:46,270
you can't be heavy weapons unless
you're an [inaudible] or above.

320
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:50,410
But when my turn came up to
go in front of the panel,

321
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:54,340
my name being an l that's
made it documented.

322
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,290
That's why I can say this.

323
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:01,360
I was the first [inaudible] ever to
be accepted for weapons, Mos training

324
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:07,000
and cause I, I told them exactly
what I had in mind. I said,

325
00:22:07,001 --> 00:22:07,900
come Monday morning,

326
00:22:07,901 --> 00:22:12,901
we've already gone through our phase
one and I've gotten my green baret and I

327
00:22:13,391 --> 00:22:17,950
said, we need to go into mols
and how this Monday I can start.

328
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:18,820
I said,

329
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:23,820
when that Mos has done is so happens
phase two of graduation exercise though

330
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:28,810
when you're go out in the field for
two weeks in survival mode. I said,

331
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:33,460
it will start immediately the
following Monday. And I said,

332
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:36,790
and I can be in Vietnam
in the next three months.

333
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:41,740
And they looked at me
and said, you got it.

334
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:45,640
So if you look at the orders,
everything from l dizzy,

335
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:51,150
there was e e Two e three e four was
in my weapons class because I started

336
00:22:52,991 --> 00:22:57,010
something that couldn't be turned
back. The tide had been turned.

337
00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:02,340
So when I got to Vietnam and
my first assignment to fob one,

338
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:07,770
I'm now a PFC e three and Pat Watkins
who has the DSC distinguished service

339
00:23:11,351 --> 00:23:13,790
cross from his uh,

340
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:19,540
time on August 23rd when
the fob four was attacked.

341
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:25,510
He told everybody there must be one bad
son of a bitch coming up here because

342
00:23:25,511 --> 00:23:28,750
he's a PFC. He's 11 Charlie s SF.

343
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:31,270
He said he's been busted down so far.

344
00:23:31,271 --> 00:23:33,920
He's gotta be the baddest
soldier working on the land.

345
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:38,920
When I showed up and he
looked at me, he goes,

346
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:41,080
you are a PFC.

347
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:44,560
Cause I as green as
grass and knew nothing.

348
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:50,660
Just been trained on ah, that's a
good, that's a good way to kick it off,

349
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,680
man. You're welcome. That will
be one. Yeah. Yeah. What did you,

350
00:23:54,681 --> 00:23:56,330
when you were going through
the trip, how long was the,

351
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:59,120
how long was the block of training
that you, so you go through bootcamp,

352
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:01,820
how long was the SF training?
Was that total? Well,

353
00:24:01,821 --> 00:24:06,360
I had to go through bootcamp and that's
where I had to volunteer to even be, uh,

354
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:09,340
go through the acceptance
of trying to be a, uh,

355
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:12,020
assigned to SF training.

356
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:17,510
Then I went into advanced ait,
which is advanced infantry training.

357
00:24:17,511 --> 00:24:21,890
You had to go through that and you also
had to sign up for airborne training.

358
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:26,300
So you had to go through all, all
the basics and come out as an 11 B,

359
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:30,510
which was a small infantry, uh, arms.

360
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,570
So anyway, uh,

361
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:39,270
then jumps to, yeah, jump
school, but I went through that,

362
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:44,360
the nomination part of taking tests
and physical tests and swimming,

363
00:24:44,671 --> 00:24:45,504
everything.

364
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:50,070
And then interviews with the SF guys
that were there that were in charge of

365
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:51,780
selecting who was going to go.

366
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:57,110
We started out with 350 men volunteering
to go through this acceptance.

367
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:00,300
They only took 35 and the end of the deal,

368
00:25:00,301 --> 00:25:05,301
I was one of the 35 and I went on to
airborne school the next day and went

369
00:25:07,201 --> 00:25:12,150
through jump school at Fort Benning,
Georgia. They put us after our last jump,

370
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:16,680
which was out of the old
boxcar one nineteens and then
they came in with the new

371
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:20,410
jets. And, uh, so I, I,

372
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:21,810
I've kind of proud of that.

373
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:27,320
And we went on a bus that night all the
way to Fort Bragg and got there in the

374
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:31,590
early morning hours of
Saturday, uh, Saturday morning.

375
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:36,950
And then Monday morning we
were in formation for our
very first day of training

376
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:41,520
in, in special forces.
And that, that block,

377
00:25:41,521 --> 00:25:46,521
there was two weeks out in survival phase
one and then eight weeks of training

378
00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:50,003
after that.

379
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:55,100
And then another two weeks
of our graduation exercises
where we're trained to

380
00:25:55,410 --> 00:25:58,260
overtake a government. That's
what special forces does,

381
00:25:58,261 --> 00:26:02,730
is actually over takeover governments
and train gorillas to do so.

382
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:07,560
And uh, so then 30 days
later I was in Vietnam

383
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:12,150
was the the, I'm sure the focus
must have been like 100% on, hey,

384
00:26:12,151 --> 00:26:14,040
you're going to Vietnam. We
know you're going to Vietnam.

385
00:26:14,041 --> 00:26:15,900
This is what it's going to be like.
This is what you're dealing with.

386
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:17,920
When I graduated [inaudible],

387
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:21,020
the colonel stood in front of us,

388
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:23,540
the head of all of trading group and said,

389
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:27,920
I don't want a one of you to volunteer
for Fifth Group spent Vietnam.

390
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:31,460
We spent too much money on you.
You're just going to go there and die.

391
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:34,640
You stay here. Pick any other group.

392
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:38,530
I'm going to go down the line with the
command sergeant major and he's going to

393
00:26:38,531 --> 00:26:40,070
tell me what group you want to go to.

394
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:43,770
I had 23 graduates in my class,

395
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:47,900
all but three volunteered for Vietnam.

396
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:51,340
He was not happy.

397
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:56,150
What I'd like you to think like why does,

398
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:00,110
why is someone during the Vietnam War
going to join special forces unless they

399
00:27:00,111 --> 00:27:01,620
want to go to Vietnam? I mean

400
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:06,120
exactly, but in my mind
there was something wrong.

401
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:08,190
It had been going on for years.

402
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:12,480
[inaudible] and special
forces had been there before.

403
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:17,690
It was a bit a war advising and
I just could not figure that out.

404
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:22,770
And I said, I've got to go. I've
got to see why it's taken so long.

405
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:26,460
It's taking longer than the World
War II and that was five years.

406
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:29,580
So why is it taking so dang long?

407
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,220
So I said I've got to get there and
do something about it. That's how I,

408
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:35,880
my attitude was, okay,

409
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:41,420
French prince comedy is going to
handle this today. I'll see. Oh,

410
00:27:41,421 --> 00:27:45,280
I see. Yeah. Yeah. All right, I'm going
to go to the book here. Go. This is,

411
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:48,290
this is going back to across
the fence and I'm obviously,

412
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:51,470
I told everyone to buy this cause
I've been reading chunks of it.

413
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:56,210
And if you haven't bought it
yet, just buy it right now. Um,

414
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:59,650
written by John Stryker Meyer.
So this is a section where he's,

415
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:02,450
he's writing about the Frenchmen.
So here we go. Within 24 hours.

416
00:28:02,451 --> 00:28:03,440
The turnover in store.

417
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:07,670
We're on recon teams at fob one and the
immediately began training immediate

418
00:28:07,671 --> 00:28:11,840
reaction drills, weapons and explosives
training, reviewing team slps,

419
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:16,960
practicing helicopter extractions on
strings and practicing wiretaps as October

420
00:28:17,391 --> 00:28:18,590
yielded to November.

421
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:22,820
Many of the members of the two recon teams
began to build a rapport because they

422
00:28:22,821 --> 00:28:26,870
were doing so much training together
on the food buy range in addition to a

423
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:28,103
Tourneau insurer.

424
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:31,850
Also quickly learned that the veteran
indigenous personnel on their teams were

425
00:28:31,851 --> 00:28:34,190
highly skilled and fearless warriors.

426
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:39,200
One night while the turbo was recording
a verbal message for his parents on his

427
00:28:39,201 --> 00:28:41,300
portable cassette player lap.

428
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:45,650
The young point man on s t Virginia
came into his room and spoken to the

429
00:28:45,651 --> 00:28:47,600
recorder. I want to tell you,

430
00:28:47,601 --> 00:28:50,300
parents have private Latino
not to worry about him.

431
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:54,050
We respect him and I'll keep an eye
out for him and don't worry if an enemy

432
00:28:54,051 --> 00:28:57,950
shoots at him. I'll catch the bullets
with my body. I'll protect your son.

433
00:28:58,310 --> 00:29:01,610
Thank you for sending him to
Vietnam. He's a good soldier

434
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:03,303
that he was,

435
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:08,890
the kid was like 16 years
old and he was our point man.

436
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:15,010
Who knows how many kills
he had. He was fearless.

437
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:19,180
His parents had been both killed.
He was an adoptee in the song.

438
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:24,280
He was raised and lived and
fought and saw. Ugh. Wow.

439
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:29,310
And he prided himself on trying to learn
how to speak English because he wanted

440
00:29:30,311 --> 00:29:32,200
to be number one interpreter.

441
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:39,100
Yeah. How'd your parents like
that? Did they ever get the tape?

442
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:40,870
They got the tape. Yeah.

443
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:45,790
I wish I knew where they were that they
passed away and we couldn't find him.

444
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:50,080
But uh, yeah, it was amazing.

445
00:29:50,081 --> 00:29:54,070
And my dad knew right then and
there I wasn't coming home.

446
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:55,370
Yeah.

447
00:29:55,370 --> 00:29:58,370
He knew I wasn't coming
home and he didn't,

448
00:29:58,371 --> 00:30:01,550
he had to try to keep my
mother from figuring that out.

449
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:06,940
But he knew that I would not be let come
Paul because of the secret missions.

450
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:09,170
He figured they would,

451
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:14,210
the government would take me out before
they would let me come home with what I

452
00:30:14,211 --> 00:30:15,100
knew. Hmm.

453
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:19,080
And Lap as a kind of Vietnamese southby
amuse ally that you never heard about

454
00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:21,810
[inaudible] that we worked with
every day. And we're alive today.

455
00:30:21,811 --> 00:30:22,850
Thanks to them. [inaudible]

456
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:26,740
we are alive to them. Oh yeah, we do.

457
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:32,200
And a couple of [inaudible] pilots.
Yeah, it's true distractions.

458
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:38,460
I have 13 string extractions. Okay.

459
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:43,210
13 for 13. Yes. Lucky 13. I know,

460
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:46,600
that's what my dad said. He had 13,

461
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:49,880
1300 bombing hours, flight hours,

462
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:55,610
but he also had 13 months in the POW
and he was also shot down on Friday the

463
00:30:55,611 --> 00:30:56,444
13th.

464
00:30:56,780 --> 00:31:01,130
April 13th. April, April 13th. Uh,

465
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:04,390
no superstition here on lunch. Yes.

466
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:10,430
Alright. Continuing on a few
days before thanksgiving.

467
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:14,750
S T Virginia is one zero
Childress announced that an
operation ordered come down

468
00:31:14,751 --> 00:31:16,040
from the s three.

469
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:19,970
The team had a mission in the
western section of the DMZ.

470
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:24,170
And then I'm going to fast
forward a little bit here to uh,

471
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:29,240
a guy named McGovern quiet
spoken McGovern, gave him
a rye half smile and said,

472
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:32,900
we can't have that. You need to have
a car. 15 for your first mission.

473
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:36,080
Follow me. The duo walked
over to McGovern's room.

474
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,300
He opened his locker and
pulled out a clean car,

475
00:31:38,301 --> 00:31:42,170
15 and handed it til the Tourneau.
This is a special car. 15 he said,

476
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:44,240
according to official army records,

477
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:49,310
this car 15 was written off as a combat
loss at fob three in case on meaning as

478
00:31:49,311 --> 00:31:50,600
far as the army's concerned,

479
00:31:50,601 --> 00:31:54,860
this weapon doesn't exist someday after
successful tour of duty in Vietnam.

480
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,060
If you're so inclined,

481
00:31:56,061 --> 00:31:59,000
you can take this baby home with
you because it doesn't exist.

482
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:04,400
But as you can see it does and it's
a sweet weapon. It never failed me.

483
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,310
And I know that since you're a weapons
man, you'll take good care of it.

484
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:11,990
Up to this point, Latino would use
an m 16 for all of his training.

485
00:32:11,991 --> 00:32:15,230
Now with his car, 15 he was
ready to take on the world.

486
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:19,970
True. It was a mean weapon.

487
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:26,300
You see it in that picture? Yeah.
Yeah. Book has the picture of it. Yeah.

488
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,433
The uh,

489
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:28,480
[inaudible]

490
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,120
and just Joe's rocking
those 20 round mags. I,

491
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:35,100
every time I see those pictures of you
guys with those 20 round Mags, I just,

492
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:36,600
I just, we carry, I carry it.

493
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:40,700
The five of them stuffed
the canteen covers.

494
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:45,980
We didn't carry food per se. All my food,

495
00:32:45,981 --> 00:32:46,814
I had

496
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:53,010
zippers sowed into my sleeves up on my
shoulders left and right and I would roll

497
00:32:55,251 --> 00:33:00,251
up dry dehydrated rice with electrical
tape instead of one full ration.

498
00:33:01,971 --> 00:33:06,971
I took one full ration of food and cut
it into five different days from maximum

499
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:13,030
output. And we only ate once
a day and we just put, uh,

500
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:16,970
we only had four quarts of water cause
we didn't want to carry any more weight

501
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:20,060
or any more, anything
else. But ammunition,

502
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:22,490
we carried all ammunition grenades,

503
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:26,750
m 79 shells cause we carried
sawed-off m 70 nines.

504
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:32,090
And so w that's all we carried was
ammunition because when we go in,

505
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:37,310
that's our supply. There's no
re supply. It's all up to us.

506
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:42,770
And many a time we came back with nothing
and had to resupply ourselves because

507
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:44,330
we got down to the last bullet

508
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:46,423
many times

509
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:51,190
25. What was your low, do you
know what your load outweighed?

510
00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:52,683
Yes.

511
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:58,020
My web gear with all the clips and
everything in it and all the water,

512
00:33:59,411 --> 00:34:03,850
all that weighed 75 pounds. My red
sack, because I carried the radio,

513
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:07,870
the PRC 25 see for claymores,

514
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:13,630
a blasting caps, all
everything that you needed, uh,

515
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:18,400
an extra antenna, all that stuff
inside. Was there another 75 pounds?

516
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:21,610
I weighed 135 I carried
150 pounds in the field.

517
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:28,400
Yeah, that's crazy. That's, that's crazy.

518
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:33,540
But that was everybody's load. The
Indian [inaudible] are mercenaries.

519
00:34:33,930 --> 00:34:38,820
They carried probably 130 pounds and
they probably didn't weigh more than 120.

520
00:34:40,410 --> 00:34:41,243
115

521
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:43,650
please. Um,

522
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:46,253
[inaudible]

523
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:52,080
continuing on the opportunity arrived on
Thanksgiving Day 1968 after the weather

524
00:34:53,741 --> 00:34:58,540
cleared at the quad tri
launch site quoting tri,

525
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:01,480
is that right? According to
Tree Quang Tree launch site,

526
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:06,010
SD Virginia boarded the king bees and
headed west of the target area with three

527
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:10,870
American and four south Vietnamese team
members lap the 17 year old hardcore

528
00:35:10,871 --> 00:35:15,730
point man who had run many
missions hone, is that right? Yes.

529
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:17,950
Home. The Interpreter Cho,

530
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:21,310
the m 79 operator and con cowboy,

531
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:26,910
don't who had fought valiantly besides
Lynne m black jr with s t Alabama as the

532
00:35:28,511 --> 00:35:31,280
second Sikorsky churned
westward, the 135 pounds,

533
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:34,750
but turno went through a mental
checklist of everything he was carrying

534
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:38,640
McGovern's car 15 the PRC 25

535
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,370
FM radio, an extra battery for it.

536
00:35:41,371 --> 00:35:46,371
Assad off m 79 m 79 grenade launcher at
22 caliber high standard pistol with a

537
00:35:47,431 --> 00:35:51,660
silencer, ammunition for all weapons,
hand-grenades gas, mass smoke grenades,

538
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:55,410
a camera, and five special
bags of dehydrated rice.

539
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,770
He quickly realized he was carrying
more than a hundred pounds of gear.

540
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:04,760
His inner thoughts were jarred when the
door gunner test fired his 30 caliber

541
00:36:04,761 --> 00:36:09,260
machine gun without announcing
his intention to anyone
with a within a matter of

542
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:09,350
seconds,

543
00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:13,520
the king be cut power and began a
tight downward spiral into the LZ were

544
00:36:13,521 --> 00:36:17,930
children. The lieutenant hone
and lap were already waiting.

545
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:21,830
The dizzying downward spiral ended as the
pilot rev the engine and landed on the

546
00:36:21,831 --> 00:36:22,664
LZ.

547
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:27,050
Cho exited the age 34 with the Terrano
and cowboy following him into the

548
00:36:27,051 --> 00:36:29,870
Woodbine connecting with the
remaining members of the team.

549
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:34,010
The king be lifted off and the LZ
quickly cleared the target area.

550
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:34,890
Okay.

551
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:37,800
And then there was absolute silence.

552
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:41,820
So there's your first, your
first mission insert right there.

553
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,100
My first answer,

554
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:47,370
you talked about having pucker time

555
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:51,380
and I'm not knowing what
the heck we're doing,

556
00:36:51,381 --> 00:36:54,920
but we just dropped out
of the sky nowhere. Uh,

557
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:59,510
and I mean it was adrenaline rush,

558
00:36:59,511 --> 00:37:00,350
but you know,

559
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:05,500
I'd been roping tigers and rhinos and
I'd be riding bulls and Bronx and you

560
00:37:07,281 --> 00:37:11,720
know, it, it just, it just came to
me, you know, but it, but it was,

561
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:16,840
I mean I'm here all my training all
that time over a year and I'm here.

562
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:21,900
This is it. This is the day. Yeah.

563
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:26,630
Now you question whether you're going
to stand up to it cause you know,

564
00:37:26,631 --> 00:37:29,930
the enemy's there, we didn't
go there for cause it wasn't,

565
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:34,220
we went there because there was a trail
that needed to be followed and find out

566
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:38,600
who was running that trail. The, uh,

567
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:41,240
the door gunner test firing.

568
00:37:41,241 --> 00:37:46,170
That 30 cow is a good wake up
call the library cause you're,

569
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:49,740
I'm sitting in the door and it's
right over my head, MCAT and the,

570
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:51,170
and not only that,

571
00:37:51,171 --> 00:37:56,171
our king bees were so stripped that they
were so light compared to the regular h

572
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:02,560
34 marine ships they could out fly him
in height and we could get up and over

573
00:38:02,751 --> 00:38:05,930
any of those mountains in those
high ranges and stuff. And,

574
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:09,730
but they dripped oil and they had oil
going down your neck all the time.

575
00:38:10,610 --> 00:38:14,660
And then when he shot that 30 cal over
the top of the hot brass hit me in the

576
00:38:14,661 --> 00:38:19,430
neck. I'm going, holy cry buddy.
You know, scared the crap out of me.

577
00:38:19,431 --> 00:38:23,980
I almost jumped out and I led, uh,

578
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:27,080
back to the [inaudible]. The

579
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:27,381
book,

580
00:38:27,381 --> 00:38:31,730
the audio contrast was starting startling
as Latino sense is adjusted to the

581
00:38:31,731 --> 00:38:36,040
quiet. He scoped out the LZ, which was
in a deep valley between jungled covered

582
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:40,330
mountains, gradually sounds of the
jungle resurfaced. Birds Chirping,

583
00:38:40,331 --> 00:38:42,040
bugs humming. After 10 minutes,

584
00:38:42,041 --> 00:38:46,930
Childress signaled the Chernow to
radio Covey with the team. Okay.

585
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:52,210
The insertion was successful. No enemy
activity evident. Children's move,

586
00:38:52,211 --> 00:38:56,260
the team toward the first mountain
movement was slowed by tall elephant grass

587
00:38:56,410 --> 00:38:59,410
and the only communication between
the team members was hand signals.

588
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:01,360
The team moved in 10 minute intervals,

589
00:39:01,361 --> 00:39:04,030
stopping every 10 minutes to listen
to what was going on around it.

590
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:06,010
After more than an hour,

591
00:39:06,011 --> 00:39:09,400
the team finally emerged from the
elephant grass as it continued to climb.

592
00:39:09,401 --> 00:39:12,610
The first mountain Laterno
was on hyper alert.

593
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:16,240
His heart pounding hard whether sitting
in alarm rest period or moving up the

594
00:39:16,241 --> 00:39:20,800
mountain near the top of the mountain
lap pointed out in observation platform

595
00:39:20,801 --> 00:39:24,910
that had been cut to the jungle high
off the ground. From that platform,

596
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:29,470
anyone could observe the LZ and the
valley where the team was inserted as well

597
00:39:29,471 --> 00:39:33,010
as the other open areas that could
be used for landing helicopters.

598
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:35,980
Had a trail watcher been
sitting on the platform.

599
00:39:35,981 --> 00:39:39,250
When s t Virginia flew into the LZ. If so,

600
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:42,730
where was he headed and when
would the NVA hit the team?

601
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:44,860
Late in the day,

602
00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:48,760
the team finally reached the top of
the mountain and found a wide well-used

603
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:51,100
trail. Latino's first thought was,

604
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:53,830
how could anyone be out
here in the middle of this,

605
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:57,870
in the middle of nowhere in
this thick jungle. Regardless,

606
00:39:57,890 --> 00:40:01,210
the team set up it's night perimeter
far above the trail where it could see

607
00:40:01,211 --> 00:40:04,150
anyone moving while remaining
camouflage and out of sight.

608
00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:08,680
At last light children's made the
final Camo check with Covey as the team

609
00:40:08,681 --> 00:40:12,340
settled in for its first night in the
jungle. It was an uneventful night.

610
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:14,860
Children's did a midnight
Camo check with Hillsborough,

611
00:40:14,861 --> 00:40:18,430
the night command aircraft that flew
high above the Ho Chi Minh trail and the

612
00:40:18,431 --> 00:40:23,431
DMZ and checked in with Covey in the
early morning after the team ate breakfast

613
00:40:24,131 --> 00:40:28,390
and shifts children's directed lap to
move parallel to the trail with cowboy as

614
00:40:28,450 --> 00:40:32,710
the tail gunner in the line of margin
and Latino walking in front of Cowboy,

615
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:37,060
the team moved slowly in less than 10
minute intervals before taking breaks to

616
00:40:37,061 --> 00:40:38,560
listen to the surrounding sounds.

617
00:40:38,830 --> 00:40:43,080
They did this because moving next to
the trail was fraught with inherit

618
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:43,973
risks.

619
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:47,440
So there's your first
night out in the jungle.

620
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:51,810
Yeah, relatively mellow. It was,

621
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:57,200
but the mosquitoes were huge and
we wore combats around our heads.

622
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:05,090
We actually use those for tourniquets is
more as we can pull them down over our

623
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,540
ears and face. Got It.

624
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:12,950
And pick those mosquitoes out the next
day cause they were like cranes and I

625
00:41:13,441 --> 00:41:15,930
mean then you have to realize too,

626
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:21,860
that's the first meal for an
entire day with a hundred days,

627
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:27,950
a hundred degree weather
and only one quarter water,

628
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:31,920
a sip in the morning, a sip at noon,

629
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:37,820
a little bit for the dehydrated
rice at night and a sip this,

630
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,660
wash it down with them. There's
one court gone for the day.

631
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:47,050
You couldn't allow yourself to drink
ever except on those intervals.

632
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:50,990
And you didn't, you didn't, did
you guys plan to resupply water?

633
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:55,220
Like did you guys look the maps and see
Nancy Rivers or anything? No streams,

634
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:58,190
no nothing. So you planned one cord a day.

635
00:41:58,310 --> 00:42:01,580
One a day we figured out is not healthy.

636
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:06,290
I know you're, I know you're a trainer,

637
00:42:06,570 --> 00:42:10,610
but that's what we had to allow ourselves
because of the weight, you know,

638
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:14,100
a gallon of water, 7.5 it is.

639
00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:19,330
So we had to judge our weight
versus ammunition and we,

640
00:42:22,310 --> 00:42:25,850
that's what we trained ourselves
to do. And not only that,

641
00:42:25,970 --> 00:42:30,970
we also took pills so that we wouldn't
go to the bathroom either because they

642
00:42:31,731 --> 00:42:33,680
could smell you on smelling American.

643
00:42:33,681 --> 00:42:36,500
That's why we had to eat rice
and eat everything they ate.

644
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:41,870
Otherwise they'd smell you, you know,
MRIs and, and can't see rations,

645
00:42:41,871 --> 00:42:42,501
all that stuff.

646
00:42:42,501 --> 00:42:47,180
They could smell that for miles and they
had trackers out there and you had to

647
00:42:47,181 --> 00:42:50,960
watch for those, which I
think you'll get to, but

648
00:42:52,910 --> 00:42:57,170
just that water rations what you have.
I trained myself for a year to do that.

649
00:42:57,171 --> 00:43:00,620
I did that all the time cause we
figured we'd be out in the six day,

650
00:43:01,070 --> 00:43:04,160
we'd come out in the six days, so
we'd have no water on the last day,

651
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:06,530
but we could survive the five days.

652
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:11,600
Do you ever take any heat casualties
guys that went down from lack of water?

653
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:15,290
Actually never did. That's
amazing. Never did in the desert.

654
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:18,770
We would even at training guys,
we'd have guys go down like on a,

655
00:43:18,830 --> 00:43:23,600
on a two day operation. I'd have
guys go down from lack of water.

656
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:26,510
I've had guys go down and
training and you state side,

657
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:30,220
but I've never had any,
our guys were, we were,

658
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:34,290
I'm just going to say we were tough when
the gender is a little different than

659
00:43:34,370 --> 00:43:37,520
the desert too. Yeah, and
because you're got shade,

660
00:43:38,670 --> 00:43:43,550
you're triple canopy, so you actually
are got shade under over the top of you.

661
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:46,640
You're not in open areas. You
never go into an open area.

662
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,280
You always follow the canopy,

663
00:43:49,550 --> 00:43:52,370
but you have to move slowly
because it's so darn thick.

664
00:43:52,371 --> 00:43:55,160
So it takes time and you have the tail.

665
00:43:55,610 --> 00:43:59,410
Gunner's job is to cover the
trail. Try to put, if you,

666
00:43:59,810 --> 00:44:02,720
everybody walks in everybody's
footprint. If you try,

667
00:44:03,470 --> 00:44:08,240
that's what you're supposed to do.
Everybody has an area to cover.

668
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:12,020
One guy turns to the right and the
other guy turns to the left point.

669
00:44:12,021 --> 00:44:16,130
Man covers the one 80 in front tail
gunner because of the one 80 and back.

670
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:18,320
And we trained like that.

671
00:44:18,470 --> 00:44:21,590
We don't turn our backs and look
at what the other guy's doing.

672
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:26,680
We only concentrate on our area and keep
that area clean unless we have to move

673
00:44:26,871 --> 00:44:27,704
in that direction.

674
00:44:27,770 --> 00:44:32,100
Then we all turn that way
and move it a precision.

675
00:44:32,490 --> 00:44:34,920
It's a precision movement
that we practice.

676
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:38,490
We train like that every
time we were back in camp,

677
00:44:38,491 --> 00:44:40,830
we train how to move.

678
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:44,630
That's why our Virginia and Archie,

679
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:49,660
Idaho or survivable teams besides the
having the luck of the gods with us,

680
00:44:52,710 --> 00:44:53,543
you know,

681
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:56,390
sometimes you gotta make your own
luck a little bit through. We,

682
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:59,330
we talk about that all the time.
Like we would train all the time.

683
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:03,220
I mean we'd patrol around the compound,
rehearse, rehearse, we'd Rehearse,

684
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:06,590
get this. It always shocks. People are
just getting in and out of the trucks.

685
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:11,210
Like, you know, we'd have a big, a big
a giant truck to transport troops in,

686
00:45:11,211 --> 00:45:15,140
but we do raids with those things and
we'd practice getting out, you know,

687
00:45:15,141 --> 00:45:19,670
like okay. Cause if this takes you
seven seconds, if you're in a firefight,

688
00:45:19,930 --> 00:45:23,810
I mean Stephan sexist of law a long time
to be trying to get out of a truck that

689
00:45:23,811 --> 00:45:27,500
people are launching grenades at,
you know, and so we'd practice that.

690
00:45:27,501 --> 00:45:29,540
We could do it quickly, do it
at night, do it in the dark,

691
00:45:29,541 --> 00:45:32,210
do it with your gear on, you
know, reverse order. Do it again.

692
00:45:32,211 --> 00:45:36,410
And that's what we do. So that we'd be,
you know, ready for those situations.

693
00:45:36,411 --> 00:45:37,630
The same thing, we actually

694
00:45:38,230 --> 00:45:42,880
working out of [inaudible] before we
had a island called monkey mountain.

695
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:43,900
Uh,

696
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:48,900
and we'd go over there and we set up a
course to walk from one side to the other

697
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:53,530
and that's how we would drain so that we,

698
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:57,520
we could continually
upgrade how we walked.

699
00:45:58,750 --> 00:46:01,330
And you guys didn't, I've
talked to tilt about this.

700
00:46:01,331 --> 00:46:05,200
You guys didn't bring mosquito nets
in the field to wear over your head.

701
00:46:05,270 --> 00:46:09,260
Never. That would be what
we had was what they call,

702
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:14,450
believe it or not, they had mosquito
repellent. That was US army issue.

703
00:46:15,050 --> 00:46:19,670
But we also had max factor
that did the makeup.

704
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:24,320
Okay. And what's that all about?
The grease paint. Camouflage.

705
00:46:24,321 --> 00:46:26,270
Paint color paint. Yeah.

706
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:32,320
And what Wade would do is take the
repellent and mix it in our palms,

707
00:46:34,810 --> 00:46:38,720
scored into our palms and put the grease
pain in our palms and then put the

708
00:46:38,721 --> 00:46:42,620
paint over our face for it to cover our
highlights. So there's no reflections.

709
00:46:43,370 --> 00:46:48,370
And besides that I used
electrical tape and wrapped up my,

710
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:53,600
my trousers at the bottom
around my, my boots.

711
00:46:53,930 --> 00:46:57,410
So to keep the leaches out
but also that closed off.

712
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:02,840
And then I also did that around the
risks of my arms. And then we wore,

713
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:03,410
we,

714
00:47:03,410 --> 00:47:08,240
our car fifteens were so hot that we had
to wear gloves with a few fingers cut

715
00:47:08,241 --> 00:47:10,310
out of them. We looked
like Michael Jackson

716
00:47:11,470 --> 00:47:16,210
way before his time and wish she had
told him about that grease paint idea.

717
00:47:16,211 --> 00:47:19,880
I liked that, but you didn't know that.
I didn't know. See, I learned something.

718
00:47:20,070 --> 00:47:22,390
There you go. A little
late. A little late. Thanks.

719
00:47:22,391 --> 00:47:27,391
So [inaudible] mosquito repellent and
that grease paint mixed together made a

720
00:47:27,491 --> 00:47:29,890
very gooey mess, but it would

721
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:32,950
keep them off of your face, you know?

722
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:35,440
And then when you are at night
when they were at their worst,

723
00:47:35,710 --> 00:47:39,040
you could pull that corvette
down and then you know,

724
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:43,420
keep 'em Outta your ears and they would
stay off your face because they didn't

725
00:47:43,421 --> 00:47:44,410
want anything to do with it.

726
00:47:44,530 --> 00:47:47,890
And we always carry just a little extra
with us to keep it going, you know,

727
00:47:48,220 --> 00:47:53,110
because being out there for five
days, you know the most that most,

728
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:57,550
I mean most of the time we get shot
out in a day, two days, three days.

729
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:03,300
But I had the luck of having
several five and seven day missions.

730
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:06,010
I, I was able to stay out a long time.

731
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:09,670
As our teams progressed
further and deeper,

732
00:48:09,850 --> 00:48:11,410
they didn't think we'd go that far,

733
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:14,890
but we went deeper than
anybody could ever go.

734
00:48:15,370 --> 00:48:20,170
We got down to some of our missions and
layoffs with one minute on time with the

735
00:48:20,171 --> 00:48:21,004
King B.

736
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:22,750
Okay.

737
00:48:22,750 --> 00:48:25,270
There was no bringing us out. Once
they dropped us on the ground,

738
00:48:25,271 --> 00:48:26,170
it was over with.

739
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:31,240
They had to go back and get fuel for
no 10 minutes station time just to your

740
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:35,260
left and to add to. But they
weren't expecting us that far.

741
00:48:36,070 --> 00:48:38,860
We could get right into
all catch him off guard.

742
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:41,253
[inaudible]

743
00:48:43,150 --> 00:48:43,561
all right.

744
00:48:43,561 --> 00:48:48,561
Going back to the book as s Virginia
moved up the second mountain cowboy and

745
00:48:48,571 --> 00:48:51,840
Latino began to hear women's
voices off the trail.

746
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:52,850
Yeah.

747
00:48:52,850 --> 00:48:56,840
Cowboy Orange Laterno to go explore the
sounds. Letourneau shook his head, no,

748
00:48:56,870 --> 00:48:58,460
indicating they had to stay with the team.

749
00:48:58,670 --> 00:49:03,110
Cowboy who spoke broken English repeated
the suggestion adding it could be a

750
00:49:03,111 --> 00:49:06,260
small NVA village. We could
kill everyone and make

751
00:49:07,910 --> 00:49:08,743
the NVA Boku angry.

752
00:49:09,410 --> 00:49:14,030
We want to let them know we can hurt them
the same way they attack our camps and

753
00:49:14,031 --> 00:49:14,864
villages,

754
00:49:15,470 --> 00:49:20,000
but turnover again declined and gave
him the hand signal to plant some m 14

755
00:49:20,001 --> 00:49:24,470
anti-personnel mines on the trail behind
them in case the NVA soldiers were

756
00:49:24,471 --> 00:49:26,570
trailing them. As a team moved on,

757
00:49:26,571 --> 00:49:31,250
Latino planted a few more toe poppers
and mark their locations on his map for

758
00:49:31,251 --> 00:49:32,840
after covering them expertly.

759
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:37,010
He laid down some powdered mustard gas
on the ground for any tracker dogs that

760
00:49:37,011 --> 00:49:41,030
might follow their trail. The mustard
gas was leftover from world war one.

761
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:44,120
How it landed. It flew by,
remained a mystery to Latino.

762
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:46,520
The good news was that it still worked.

763
00:49:47,030 --> 00:49:51,260
The fact that it was the
fact was confirmed during
the next break when the team

764
00:49:51,261 --> 00:49:55,820
heard a dog howl in anguish after
snorting some of the old mustard gassed.

765
00:49:57,340 --> 00:50:01,870
Maybe it didn't work that well because
a few minutes later the dog was back on

766
00:50:01,871 --> 00:50:06,100
the team's trail. Cowboy told the Turno
to use his pistol to kill the dog.

767
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:10,270
Latino's mind flashback to special forces
training group born instructors had

768
00:50:10,271 --> 00:50:12,250
said the same thing,
but turnip pulled out.

769
00:50:12,251 --> 00:50:15,310
The 22 quietly moved back down the trail,

770
00:50:15,430 --> 00:50:19,570
took off as rock rucksack and moved a
few more feet before lying down on the

771
00:50:19,571 --> 00:50:20,770
ground facing the trail.

772
00:50:21,190 --> 00:50:25,780
The dog never realized the Turner was
there when the dog was about 10 feet away.

773
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:27,920
Letourneau fired one shot.

774
00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:30,860
It struck the dog between the
eyes killing him instantly.

775
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:35,810
The canine dropped in his tracks out
of Latino's view on aware of what had

776
00:50:35,811 --> 00:50:39,950
happened. The dog's handler moved up
the trail. He got near the dead dog.

777
00:50:40,310 --> 00:50:42,680
When he got near the deck dog,
he stepped on a toe popper.

778
00:50:43,130 --> 00:50:46,010
Letourneau in cowboy heard the
NVA screaming in pain and anguish.

779
00:50:46,220 --> 00:50:50,930
They left him behind figuring he would
die shortly the team moved further up the

780
00:50:50,931 --> 00:50:54,080
mountain with Latino and cowboy
providing rear security again,

781
00:50:54,081 --> 00:50:57,200
Latino and cowboy heard women's
voices below them again.

782
00:50:57,201 --> 00:51:01,010
Cowboy urged the turtle to go downhill
and attack the encampment and again

783
00:51:01,011 --> 00:51:04,390
Latino declined. That's a,

784
00:51:04,550 --> 00:51:08,750
that's so these guys are on you
obviously at this point when,

785
00:51:10,070 --> 00:51:13,010
when you are, you guys are still
heading up the mountain because, but,

786
00:51:13,110 --> 00:51:16,670
but do you think you can get away
from them and what is your point?

787
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:19,790
What is your, what is your, what are
you trying to accomplish at this point?

788
00:51:19,970 --> 00:51:24,470
At this point we're trying to get away
from the tracker but I've managed to take

789
00:51:24,471 --> 00:51:28,280
care of the chapter but we don't
know how many people are there.

790
00:51:28,550 --> 00:51:32,300
We keep hearing the voices
of women's voices below us.

791
00:51:32,810 --> 00:51:36,590
Cowboy keeps wanting me to go down there
with him trying to confuse the whole

792
00:51:36,591 --> 00:51:40,010
situation cause he wants to kill him
cause he says it'll make them mad.

793
00:51:40,190 --> 00:51:43,840
Then they'll come after us and
we can really get into it. Well,

794
00:51:44,030 --> 00:51:48,830
cowboy just got off a mission on October
5th which is in the book where they

795
00:51:48,831 --> 00:51:53,831
decimated a 10,000 man
division of all things.

796
00:51:54,650 --> 00:51:58,760
Eight and a half hours. They took down
85% of them with an eight man team.

797
00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:03,490
Incredible. But it's true and he,

798
00:52:03,890 --> 00:52:05,990
they stacked bodies up for sandbags.

799
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:09,230
That's how many they were killing so fast.

800
00:52:09,830 --> 00:52:12,950
But he was insistent.

801
00:52:13,010 --> 00:52:16,550
But I told him we can't do that because
I can't split the team. I have to do it.

802
00:52:16,551 --> 00:52:20,450
My one zero says I'm just a one two I'm,

803
00:52:20,750 --> 00:52:23,240
I'm low man on the totem
pole here, you know,

804
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:27,800
and there's even a lieutenant with us,
but he's, he's the one one, he's below.

805
00:52:27,950 --> 00:52:32,090
He's actually below my sergeant
because there's no rank in song.

806
00:52:32,540 --> 00:52:37,160
That was one of the things that always
took me aback was there was no rankings

807
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:42,080
and song. We didn't carry rank, we didn't
wear rank. It was whoever was there.

808
00:52:42,081 --> 00:52:46,580
The longest that lived the longest was
the 10 head man. These the ones zero,

809
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:50,600
whoever lived the longest was the one
zero. And that's how it went down.

810
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:52,820
And then when that one zero was killed,

811
00:52:52,821 --> 00:52:57,821
the one one took over usually took over
the team from there on until he was

812
00:52:59,091 --> 00:53:02,480
killed. And then the next one,
the one two would take over.

813
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:05,790
He would cause he'd stepped up to the
one one position and that's how our,

814
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:10,220
we progressed with our teams
because everybody was killed one as,

815
00:53:10,430 --> 00:53:14,150
as it as we went along.
We were just lucky.

816
00:53:15,140 --> 00:53:19,240
But I did lose my one
zero Gunther Wall and uh,

817
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:24,320
of course children's went home and he
was lost to an automobile accident.

818
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:29,960
And so it's just, you know, but
that's how well they progressing.

819
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:35,280
And at this point, this is your
first mission you got. It's like,

820
00:53:36,050 --> 00:53:38,490
um, I'm trying to do
everything right. Yeah.

821
00:53:38,491 --> 00:53:40,680
And you're getting the full
benefit on your first mission.

822
00:53:40,790 --> 00:53:45,210
You've got the dog track and you,
you've got the, the NVA camp down below.

823
00:53:45,350 --> 00:53:48,660
You've got the women's voices, you've
got the tracker coming up behind the dog.

824
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:51,390
I mean it's, he's hitting
the tow popper. This is like,

825
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:55,160
and we know getting everything, everything
you were hoping for. Here it is.

826
00:53:55,161 --> 00:53:55,994
Here it is.

827
00:53:56,820 --> 00:54:01,820
And we know the is there because the
jungle because their families are there.

828
00:54:02,041 --> 00:54:04,800
So we know of course we
are on, we're thinking too.

829
00:54:04,801 --> 00:54:06,200
Maybe they there the tracking,

830
00:54:06,220 --> 00:54:09,520
there's families too, you know,
because they would hire trackers.

831
00:54:09,521 --> 00:54:12,520
They tell the trackers. You either
track for us, we'll kill you.

832
00:54:13,330 --> 00:54:18,250
And so they have no choices but because
they're just indulge out there living,

833
00:54:18,370 --> 00:54:19,780
trying to survive.

834
00:54:20,230 --> 00:54:23,380
So you're trying to get up the mountain
and get away from the track or was it

835
00:54:23,381 --> 00:54:24,970
possible to shake the trackers?

836
00:54:24,971 --> 00:54:29,710
Was it possible to like actually
lose them sometimes? Sometimes.

837
00:54:30,460 --> 00:54:33,250
Uh, or did you feel like once
the trackers were on you,

838
00:54:33,310 --> 00:54:35,350
you were pretty much
headed into your extract?

839
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:37,930
Exactly. Exactly. Because they were,

840
00:54:38,170 --> 00:54:42,850
they were communicating in some way of
fashion and let the NBA know we fought

841
00:54:42,851 --> 00:54:47,660
regular Jews. We never shot, fought the
Vietcong that the Vic called the VC. We,

842
00:54:48,050 --> 00:54:51,400
we, we actually fought uniformed, uh,

843
00:54:52,210 --> 00:54:53,440
MVA and uh,

844
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:57,310
the regular army that
the north Vietnamese had.

845
00:54:57,640 --> 00:55:02,640
But we needed to get off of the keep off
the trail and keep going the cause we

846
00:55:02,741 --> 00:55:04,840
needed to find out where
this trail was going.

847
00:55:04,841 --> 00:55:08,290
This was our mission to try to
figure out where this trail went.

848
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:13,330
It we did accomplish it in the, in the
end because I went on a second mission,

849
00:55:13,331 --> 00:55:16,800
which is later in the book and uh,

850
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:22,440
I found actually went into north Vietnam
and with inserted on Christmas of 68 in

851
00:55:24,401 --> 00:55:27,760
north Vietnam on the
same trail but higher up.

852
00:55:28,390 --> 00:55:32,530
And that's a whole different
story there. But [inaudible]

853
00:55:32,970 --> 00:55:37,680
well, going back to
this story, here we go.

854
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:41,040
By the time Letourneau completed
his last radio call to Covey,

855
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:44,730
the team was involved in darkness and
team members began to set up a perimeter

856
00:55:44,731 --> 00:55:48,060
for the night. Dawn broke
without any enemy activity.

857
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:50,100
When Covey flew over
the team in the morning,

858
00:55:50,250 --> 00:55:52,560
he warn childrens that a
team was being extracted,

859
00:55:52,590 --> 00:55:56,700
extracted under heavy fire and another
was being inserted into a top priority.

860
00:55:56,701 --> 00:56:00,060
Target. Sit tight was the
last instruction from Covey.

861
00:56:00,770 --> 00:56:05,100
St Virginia didn't move from its quiet
spot alongside the mountain during lunch

862
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:05,910
hour. The member,

863
00:56:05,910 --> 00:56:09,240
each member ate in shifts and Latino
went out to inspect the claim.

864
00:56:09,241 --> 00:56:13,620
More minds the team had deployed to
ensure the NVA hadn't turned the deadly

865
00:56:13,621 --> 00:56:17,160
explosive devices around
to face toward them.

866
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:21,270
When he completed his inspection,
Latino found a log to sit behind.

867
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:22,950
The NVA would actually do that.

868
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:26,020
They'd crawl up to your perimeter
and turn your claim on triple canopy.

869
00:56:26,021 --> 00:56:26,830
You don't, you could

870
00:56:26,830 --> 00:56:29,320
pass him up within two feet of you.

871
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:32,260
They could be two feet away from
me and you wouldn't know it.

872
00:56:32,770 --> 00:56:36,580
That's how thick the jungle
is and you would see a foot,

873
00:56:37,930 --> 00:56:39,310
you know, you think combat,

874
00:56:40,390 --> 00:56:43,540
you might see a foot and you shoot
the foot as long as you shot the foot,

875
00:56:43,690 --> 00:56:47,440
you know, he was down. He wouldn't
go to survive. They had no hospitals,

876
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:52,330
you know, see that. You could count
that as a, as a kill, but you know,

877
00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:57,340
but you can see, you just had to
mow down the jungle, open it up.

878
00:56:57,730 --> 00:56:58,750
Guess where they're at.

879
00:57:00,860 --> 00:57:05,590
The green tracers coming out
gave you a clue. Yeah. Yeah.

880
00:57:05,610 --> 00:57:06,890
Just shocking to me that they,

881
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:11,780
they would crawl up and try
and turn around your claymore
mines so that when you

882
00:57:11,781 --> 00:57:14,690
attack, when they attacked you, then
you clock off your claymores and boom,

883
00:57:14,691 --> 00:57:17,200
you're actually claimed
warring yourself. Later on.

884
00:57:18,210 --> 00:57:23,210
The CIA gave us a piece of equipment that
I carried that had a little thread out

885
00:57:25,591 --> 00:57:29,630
of a box and you could wrap
that whole thread around your,

886
00:57:29,850 --> 00:57:34,850
at your encampment or where you were a
always is right at the moment and put it

887
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:40,790
in your ear and if that thread was broke,

888
00:57:41,100 --> 00:57:45,860
it would sound a buzzing noise in your
ear and you knew somebody came through.

889
00:57:46,060 --> 00:57:46,950
It could have been an animal,

890
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:50,130
but you knew somebody came through your
perimeter and you just had to put it in

891
00:57:50,131 --> 00:57:54,210
front of all your claymores
and then to stop it,

892
00:57:54,211 --> 00:57:59,100
you just lit a match and burnt it.
[inaudible] use it the next day,

893
00:57:59,330 --> 00:58:01,350
the next time. But once I had that,

894
00:58:01,380 --> 00:58:04,920
my by perimeters were
always covered after that.

895
00:58:08,260 --> 00:58:10,390
Going back to the book
later in the afternoon,

896
00:58:10,540 --> 00:58:13,870
children's signaled the team to pull in
their claim or minds and prepare to move

897
00:58:13,871 --> 00:58:18,060
out. Due to the combined weight of his
rucksack and web gear. We'll turn him,

898
00:58:18,061 --> 00:58:23,061
moved to his knees and slung his rucksack
on his back just as it landed on his

899
00:58:23,261 --> 00:58:24,094
back.

900
00:58:24,370 --> 00:58:29,370
AK 47 his open fire Laterno was
slammed to the ground face first.

901
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:33,430
The impact so severe he thought he had
broken his nose, startled the Turno,

902
00:58:33,431 --> 00:58:34,250
jumped up with his car.

903
00:58:34,250 --> 00:58:38,440
15 pointing toward the AK 47 gunfire
that was near the front of the team.

904
00:58:38,590 --> 00:58:40,750
Surprised that there was no NVA near him.

905
00:58:41,260 --> 00:58:46,260
Latino removed the rucksack to discover
that for AK 47 rounds had ripped through

906
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:51,720
the 23 pound PRC 25 he reached into an
especially especially tailored pocket on

907
00:58:54,281 --> 00:58:56,950
his fatigues shirt, which was
sewn with vertical zippers.

908
00:58:57,130 --> 00:59:00,730
One on the left side of the shirt and
one of the right side between the top and

909
00:59:00,731 --> 00:59:05,731
bottom of the pockets of the shirt and
pulled out his URC 10 emergency radio and

910
00:59:06,611 --> 00:59:09,670
broadcast a general alert
for any aircraft in the area.

911
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:13,870
S T Virginia was declaring
a prairie fire emergency.

912
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:15,193
Yeah.

913
00:59:15,750 --> 00:59:17,970
So this is like your
first fire from the enemy.

914
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:21,530
You could shop the radio for four
rounds in the radio. Knock down.

915
00:59:21,820 --> 00:59:25,930
Yeah. I didn't know nothing. All I
knew in my button nose was busted.

916
00:59:26,710 --> 00:59:27,970
I thought it was anyway,

917
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:32,860
and then I'm going and I'm having
to think what am I supposed to do?

918
00:59:32,950 --> 00:59:35,830
And I was my first reaction. Meanwhile,

919
00:59:35,831 --> 00:59:39,190
my one zero children's was mad
as hell at me because he says,

920
00:59:39,191 --> 00:59:43,630
bring me that damn radio. I said that
her tinning could do crap for us.

921
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:48,220
He said, I said, it ain't working.
I think it's shot up. And I said,

922
00:59:48,221 --> 00:59:52,750
it don't work. There's no signal.
And so I brought it to him.

923
00:59:53,380 --> 00:59:54,310
Well, needless to say,

924
00:59:54,610 --> 00:59:59,350
I was standing up when I brought it to
him and he's laying on the ground and he

925
00:59:59,351 --> 01:00:02,320
grabs me. He says, can't
you just get down? Well,

926
01:00:02,321 --> 01:00:06,430
the AK 47 rounds are hitting all over
us. We're in the middle of a firefight.

927
01:00:06,431 --> 01:00:08,500
Art Work, returning fire me.

928
01:00:08,501 --> 01:00:12,610
I'm still standing there in shock
and he pulls me to the ground,

929
01:00:12,611 --> 01:00:15,550
saves my life, and he says,

930
01:00:15,910 --> 01:00:19,720
he looks at the radio real quick and
he goes, the intent has been shot off.

931
01:00:19,990 --> 01:00:24,990
That was the fifth round that went
through a breach between my red sac and my

932
01:00:26,861 --> 01:00:31,750
web gear and pulled out my spare antenna
and screwed it on. And we had Camo,

933
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:37,420
maybe it was good to go air
condition and we just then,

934
01:00:39,810 --> 01:00:40,600
uh,

935
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:45,600
Pat Watkins is flying over
our copywriter and he called,

936
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:48,390
we, he assessed what was going on.

937
01:00:48,410 --> 01:00:52,230
He could see it from where his location
was in the air and he could see,

938
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:56,500
he could see we were taking massive
amounts of fire and he called for an

939
01:00:56,501 --> 01:00:58,650
extraction from Kong tree and they,

940
01:00:58,850 --> 01:01:02,270
they brought the king bees in to
get us and we had to, you know,

941
01:01:02,970 --> 01:01:07,080
yeah, yeah. The, the uh, once
he got that, once he got,

942
01:01:07,110 --> 01:01:10,290
once he got the radio back from you and
it started working children's screams

943
01:01:10,291 --> 01:01:13,500
into the radio, we need an x fill now
and declaring prairie fire emergency.

944
01:01:13,590 --> 01:01:16,530
Is anyone out there? We did a
second or two. There was a response.

945
01:01:16,870 --> 01:01:19,890
Calm down Childress, I realize
you're under fire. Set a Kovi rider.

946
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:21,900
Just at that moment,

947
01:01:21,901 --> 01:01:25,950
several AK 47 is opened up
from the woodline near the
log where Latino had been

948
01:01:26,010 --> 01:01:29,970
unceremoniously slammed onto his face,
lap and cowboy. He returned fire.

949
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:31,673
Covey continued.

950
01:01:31,770 --> 01:01:35,640
We heard your team declare a prairie
fire emergency on the guard frequency and

951
01:01:35,641 --> 01:01:39,330
I've rallied the cavalry. What's your
mark? Do you have an LLC in site?

952
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:42,990
Before children's said a word of the
radio, he turned to Latino and said, see,

953
01:01:43,170 --> 01:01:47,070
it works. Supposedly we'd
left it for the NVA. Never.

954
01:01:47,071 --> 01:01:51,600
I say never ever leave a radio
behind. As if to emphasize that point,

955
01:01:51,601 --> 01:01:56,190
the NVA open fire again as a lab took
as that began looking for an LZ wall,

956
01:01:56,191 --> 01:01:59,820
moving the team down the hill, away
from the most concentrated NVA gunfire,

957
01:02:00,210 --> 01:02:02,940
cutting lectern, no slack.
Children's roared. Tell Covey.

958
01:02:03,030 --> 01:02:04,950
We'll give them a fixed in five minutes.

959
01:02:04,951 --> 01:02:06,630
We'll probably need
strings to get outta here.

960
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:11,580
I doubt we can make it into the valley
where Kim B King B can pick us up without

961
01:02:11,581 --> 01:02:12,414
missing a beat.

962
01:02:12,570 --> 01:02:16,350
Latino who for the first time felt
for burning stings in his back,

963
01:02:16,470 --> 01:02:21,470
repeated those words to Covey while he
and cowboy providing cover fire as the

964
01:02:22,051 --> 01:02:23,550
tail element of the team.

965
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:28,470
Then Latino nodded a cowboy who ignited
several claymore minds that the team had

966
01:02:28,471 --> 01:02:29,580
set out on this perimeter.

967
01:02:29,910 --> 01:02:34,440
Those mines only slowed the NVA for a
few seconds before the dust and debris

968
01:02:34,590 --> 01:02:35,730
from the blast settled.

969
01:02:35,731 --> 01:02:40,050
The NVA soldiers were moving through it
toward cowboy and Latino without saying

970
01:02:40,051 --> 01:02:43,980
a word. The two men took turns firing
at the enemy while moving down the hill,

971
01:02:44,430 --> 01:02:48,450
rotating around each other. Cowboy
would fire several bursts from his car.

972
01:02:48,451 --> 01:02:49,860
15 and then reload.

973
01:02:49,861 --> 01:02:54,660
As you reloaded Latina would open fire
providing cover covering fire for the

974
01:02:54,661 --> 01:02:57,300
team. The classic covering moves scenario?

975
01:02:57,550 --> 01:03:01,900
Yes. Just the way we drill
it. That's right. Oh yeah,

976
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:06,730
and it just came natural.
Believe it or not,

977
01:03:06,731 --> 01:03:10,390
it just came natural. What
part of it just came natural?

978
01:03:10,690 --> 01:03:13,480
Just load and fire and fire and move.

979
01:03:13,481 --> 01:03:16,900
Load and fire move load
and fire and it just, we,

980
01:03:16,970 --> 01:03:21,580
we had to get in the team
came together, our firepower.

981
01:03:22,060 --> 01:03:27,060
You can only imagine what a full team
of firepower with all car fifteens and m

982
01:03:27,251 --> 01:03:30,130
70 nines and Claymore mines going off.

983
01:03:30,190 --> 01:03:34,210
They knew they had a battle but
they'd were overpowering us.

984
01:03:34,510 --> 01:03:35,600
Yeah and it's,

985
01:03:36,170 --> 01:03:37,760
I talked about this with tilt as well,

986
01:03:37,790 --> 01:03:42,790
like the determination of of them
where you think of the insurgence,

987
01:03:43,670 --> 01:03:46,100
insurgent army, you know their
rule is like, hey we don't,

988
01:03:46,101 --> 01:03:48,110
we don't need to fight. We don't
need to win this firefight.

989
01:03:48,111 --> 01:03:50,390
We don't need to win this battle because
we're going to be here for a long time.

990
01:03:50,391 --> 01:03:50,901
We can wait.

991
01:03:50,901 --> 01:03:55,280
We will fight when we want to fight and
it's the way that they attacked you guys

992
01:03:55,281 --> 01:03:59,360
and lot took so many losses but continued
to press and continue to press like

993
01:03:59,630 --> 01:04:00,860
their, their fighting spirit.

994
01:04:01,580 --> 01:04:04,770
Hi. Well let me give
you a backdrop on that.

995
01:04:06,150 --> 01:04:08,280
Maybe tilt hasn't even got to that.

996
01:04:09,180 --> 01:04:14,180
After the war is over with and history
starts evolving in the books and people

997
01:04:14,701 --> 01:04:16,110
start asking questions.

998
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:19,950
We find out that they've got
40,000 troops hunting this down,

999
01:04:20,190 --> 01:04:21,480
hunting saugers down

1000
01:04:22,980 --> 01:04:25,830
and there's a huge bounty on us.

1001
01:04:25,950 --> 01:04:30,950
We heard hundred thousand $200,000 to
kill an American on a song team and had a

1002
01:04:32,671 --> 01:04:36,000
kill an American award.
If they kill somebody.

1003
01:04:36,150 --> 01:04:40,710
They got the award and the bonus and
their instant heroes and who neu forever.

1004
01:04:42,060 --> 01:04:46,000
It meant everything to
them to kill us and they I,

1005
01:04:46,140 --> 01:04:51,140
they put 40,000 troops designated that
we had tied up because they wanted to

1006
01:04:53,191 --> 01:04:58,050
kill us cause we did so much
damage to them. Go ahead.

1007
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:04,930
Speaking of damage, during
one short Lall cowboy, again,

1008
01:05:05,210 --> 01:05:08,700
plan to claim or mine in the direction
of the advancing NVA and Latino dugout,

1009
01:05:08,740 --> 01:05:12,040
another claim or from his rucksack and
placed a ten second delay fuse in it.

1010
01:05:12,430 --> 01:05:16,930
When the NVA, again, advanced cowboy
ignited his Clayborne mind claim more.

1011
01:05:17,530 --> 01:05:19,930
When the NBA moved again toward the team.

1012
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:23,770
Latino ignited his fuse and ran down the
hill with cowboy to catch up to their

1013
01:05:23,771 --> 01:05:28,771
team before they reached the team to be
40 anti-personnel rockets slammed into

1014
01:05:29,111 --> 01:05:31,510
the trees above them,
showering them with shrapnel.

1015
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:36,720
A few more exploded as Latino and cowboy
moved down the hill the ten second then

1016
01:05:37,721 --> 01:05:39,970
the ten second fuse ignited
in another claim war.

1017
01:05:40,270 --> 01:05:44,530
It brought it bought precious time for
the gun and run team of Latino and cowboy

1018
01:05:45,130 --> 01:05:48,490
to cover ground and catch up with
the remainder of St Virginia.

1019
01:05:49,060 --> 01:05:53,380
Would you guys drill pulling out those
claymores were the ten second fuse and

1020
01:05:53,381 --> 01:05:55,150
hooking them up and setting
them up. I mean, you know,

1021
01:05:55,151 --> 01:05:57,340
it takes like a little
bit of time to do that.

1022
01:05:57,460 --> 01:06:00,490
Did you guys have them pre rigged where
you could just stick them in the ground?

1023
01:06:00,491 --> 01:06:01,510
How did you guys do that?

1024
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:06,490
We did. We had him pre-reqs.
Everybody says, well,

1025
01:06:06,491 --> 01:06:08,740
you can't have your blasting
caps with you. You're just,

1026
01:06:08,890 --> 01:06:12,250
they hit the black sketch is going
to blow you to smithereens. Yeah.

1027
01:06:12,251 --> 01:06:13,960
But those precious seconds would be,

1028
01:06:14,410 --> 01:06:19,280
and I had mine in my red Sag
Pre-req. There you go. Yeah.

1029
01:06:19,460 --> 01:06:23,080
With us with Bubba had his precut so
we had to five seconds, 10 seconds,

1030
01:06:23,140 --> 01:06:27,370
and in longer than you had the actual
cracker itself with the full standard

1031
01:06:27,371 --> 01:06:30,890
court that you could blow, that
would give you more distance.

1032
01:06:30,891 --> 01:06:33,100
How long was that
course? 50 feet. 50 feet.

1033
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:37,040
So you could put the claymore down on a
tree and pulled back and then you hit it

1034
01:06:37,420 --> 01:06:40,900
handheld. Or as we did that one mission,

1035
01:06:40,901 --> 01:06:42,820
we were using the five
seconds that bubba put in,

1036
01:06:43,780 --> 01:06:45,490
but they were pre cut and
we had them ready to go.

1037
01:06:45,670 --> 01:06:48,580
So he just put the fuse in and pull
it and then stick it in the ground.

1038
01:06:48,750 --> 01:06:49,583
You're the little steaks,

1039
01:06:49,980 --> 01:06:54,430
the standard Gregg jam it in the
ground and you're good. Yeah.

1040
01:06:54,490 --> 01:06:56,660
So you're setting those
things up in like 10 seconds.

1041
01:06:56,730 --> 01:06:59,800
So she always had to make sure they
were pointed the right way. Yes, indeed.

1042
01:07:01,210 --> 01:07:05,890
Point towards the enemy, towards
the enemy. Read the back.

1043
01:07:08,340 --> 01:07:12,550
Uh, continue on as Childers called an
airstrikes Latino reflected on house.

1044
01:07:12,551 --> 01:07:14,130
Surreal. This firefight had been.

1045
01:07:14,220 --> 01:07:17,880
It wasn't like anything he'd witnessed
on television or oriented in any movie.

1046
01:07:18,060 --> 01:07:20,940
Instead of men charging each other
and killing each other in plain sight.

1047
01:07:21,030 --> 01:07:22,650
Here in triple canopy jungle,

1048
01:07:22,770 --> 01:07:27,770
he observed green tracers from AK 47 his
first or at the most an enemy hand or

1049
01:07:27,841 --> 01:07:28,674
foot,

1050
01:07:28,770 --> 01:07:33,370
and somehow the NVA found firing lanes
where they could launch shoulder held B

1051
01:07:33,371 --> 01:07:37,830
40 anti-personnel rockets that slammed
above and around them as they raced down

1052
01:07:37,831 --> 01:07:41,010
the hill for their lives.
Again, the [inaudible],

1053
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:44,190
the voices of the special forces
instructors echoed in his mind.

1054
01:07:44,460 --> 01:07:49,080
They had told the young aspiring Green
Berets at Fort Bragg that the NBA was a

1055
01:07:49,081 --> 01:07:50,790
tough, resilient opponent.

1056
01:07:51,780 --> 01:07:55,710
Many had fought against the Japanese
during World War II and against the French

1057
01:07:55,711 --> 01:07:57,030
driving them from Vietnam.

1058
01:07:57,031 --> 01:08:00,900
In 1954 after the battle of
den BN Pew in North Vietnam,

1059
01:08:01,830 --> 01:08:05,280
the sounds of king bees in the distance
and the crashing funder of beef 40

1060
01:08:05,650 --> 01:08:07,110
rocket slamming into trees above his head,

1061
01:08:07,111 --> 01:08:10,860
shook Latino out of his moment of
introspection and turned his own divided

1062
01:08:10,861 --> 01:08:14,280
attention to a crescendo of
AK 47 fire from the enemy.

1063
01:08:14,430 --> 01:08:16,100
S T responded with

1064
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:20,570
volley after volley of full
and semiautomatic gunfire
while the Toronto and Cho

1065
01:08:20,571 --> 01:08:25,571
fired several m 79 rounds toward the
densest section of the jungle where the AK

1066
01:08:25,881 --> 01:08:28,640
47 gunfire was emanating.

1067
01:08:29,650 --> 01:08:30,080
Okay.

1068
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:32,240
Through the gunfire, someone
popped a smoke grenade,

1069
01:08:32,241 --> 01:08:35,660
which brought the king bees closer to
our t Virginia's location in the jungle

1070
01:08:35,900 --> 01:08:37,370
over the din of gunfire,

1071
01:08:37,490 --> 01:08:41,120
children's and cowboy told everyone to
put their Swiss seats on and prepare for

1072
01:08:41,121 --> 01:08:43,640
an extraction. In short order,

1073
01:08:43,820 --> 01:08:48,260
a King Bee was hovering over St Virginia
more than 125 feet above the jungle

1074
01:08:48,261 --> 01:08:49,094
floor.

1075
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:54,290
Latino Cowboy Cho and honed hook hook
their d-rings into the old McGuire rig

1076
01:08:54,291 --> 01:08:56,480
that hung from the end
of the ropes. And shortly

1077
01:08:57,450 --> 01:08:59,280
we're being lifted out of the jungle.

1078
01:09:00,180 --> 01:09:03,750
As the quartet of recon men
was being lifted into the air,

1079
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:08,840
the envy on the NVA unleashed another
salvo of AK 47 gunfire and several

1080
01:09:09,620 --> 01:09:10,410
[inaudible] rockets.

1081
01:09:10,410 --> 01:09:14,490
Shrapnel from the rockets hit them with
varying degrees of size and velocity.

1082
01:09:14,670 --> 01:09:16,020
All of them were wounded.

1083
01:09:16,980 --> 01:09:20,640
It was during those explosions that Latino
realized his car 15 and somehow been

1084
01:09:20,641 --> 01:09:23,970
caught in a rope above him just far
enough away that he couldn't reach it.

1085
01:09:24,060 --> 01:09:27,750
He pulled out his m 79 and launched a
40 millimeter grenade toward the NVA

1086
01:09:27,751 --> 01:09:28,584
positions.

1087
01:09:28,650 --> 01:09:33,480
Now all he could see for of the enemy
were hundreds of muzzle blast from AK 40

1088
01:09:33,481 --> 01:09:37,020
sevens in green tracers,
re green trace arounds,

1089
01:09:37,050 --> 01:09:42,050
eerily climbing toward the quartet of
s t Virginia men before he could reload

1090
01:09:42,570 --> 01:09:46,350
his m 79 the king B began to
move away from the target area,

1091
01:09:46,440 --> 01:09:49,350
surprising him because the men
had not yet cleared the jungle.

1092
01:09:49,650 --> 01:09:51,960
Instead of continuing to
climb out of the target,

1093
01:09:52,140 --> 01:09:54,180
moving straight up until
the men cleared the jungles.

1094
01:09:54,181 --> 01:09:56,160
Triple canopy of trees and vegetation.

1095
01:09:56,310 --> 01:09:59,910
The King Bee was moving away from the
target area due to heavy enemy ground

1096
01:09:59,911 --> 01:10:00,510
fire.

1097
01:10:00,510 --> 01:10:04,230
In recent months at least two king bees
were shot down during string extractions

1098
01:10:04,231 --> 01:10:08,160
from hot targets, but these facts
were unknown to Latino at the time.

1099
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:12,870
Shrapnel from the beef 40 rockets split
exploded around Estee Virginia men

1100
01:10:12,871 --> 01:10:15,660
stinging them with bits of
hot metal. Further spooking,

1101
01:10:15,661 --> 01:10:20,220
the King B crew Latino began to
violently collide with tall jungle trees,

1102
01:10:20,340 --> 01:10:22,530
feeling like a metal ball
in a pinball machine.

1103
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:28,840
Latino Karun off several more trees as
at least one more be 40 exploded in the

1104
01:10:29,131 --> 01:10:31,570
tree tops again, showering
him with trapped [inaudible].

1105
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:36,000
A tree branch hit Laterno from the side
and turned them upside down in his in

1106
01:10:36,001 --> 01:10:40,260
his rope Swiss seat as the rope
began to slip down from his hips,

1107
01:10:40,261 --> 01:10:44,010
Latino remembered spider telling him
how a one zero from another team had

1108
01:10:44,011 --> 01:10:47,040
recently been shot out of his Swiss
seat during a rope extraction.

1109
01:10:47,220 --> 01:10:51,300
Another tree struck Laterno before he was
able to muster a surge of strength and

1110
01:10:51,301 --> 01:10:54,930
momentum to reach up and
grab the rope above him as,

1111
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:57,750
as his body finally cleared the tree top.

1112
01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:02,760
The only thing between him and certain
death blow on the jungle floor 200 feet

1113
01:11:03,180 --> 01:11:06,780
down was the single
piece of rope tied into

1114
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:13,473
the King B. Jeez.

1115
01:11:14,310 --> 01:11:17,160
Just another day in sock,
just another day in saga.

1116
01:11:17,250 --> 01:11:19,050
And I had 13 of those like that.

1117
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:20,673
Okay.

1118
01:11:23,260 --> 01:11:26,930
How did you guys, uh, when you,

1119
01:11:26,940 --> 01:11:30,450
when you're getting hit with all that
and you're shooting back hanging from a

1120
01:11:30,451 --> 01:11:34,890
string, I mean, that's just
like completely insane that,

1121
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:37,980
that no one died on that, on
that rope, on that extraction.

1122
01:11:38,020 --> 01:11:39,310
And you're also spinning.

1123
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:44,720
Well, just the rotation that one comp,
we get knocked around the strings

1124
01:11:45,010 --> 01:11:49,880
Benning and the air is flowing past you
and you're having, you know, you're,

1125
01:11:49,881 --> 01:11:53,440
you're just trying everything
you do to stick with it.

1126
01:11:54,010 --> 01:11:58,480
But that was my first mission. Uh,

1127
01:11:58,540 --> 01:12:03,540
later on I've finally realized that I
didn't have a extra d ring on my web gear,

1128
01:12:05,650 --> 01:12:10,570
the strap in. That's why I was falling
over backwards. I did that twice.

1129
01:12:10,990 --> 01:12:14,440
Then I finally found out
from my good buddy here,

1130
01:12:15,640 --> 01:12:17,410
tilt that I was doing it wrong,

1131
01:12:18,660 --> 01:12:22,880
but because after my second mission, uh,

1132
01:12:23,110 --> 01:12:24,130
children's had left,

1133
01:12:24,190 --> 01:12:28,630
but he had not given me that
information out of all of our training,

1134
01:12:29,290 --> 01:12:33,530
had not thought about it. He
was extracted on another jobber.

1135
01:12:33,820 --> 01:12:35,680
So he didn't see that happen.

1136
01:12:39,080 --> 01:12:42,590
It's just, it's, it's unbelievable.
When I, when I read these things,

1137
01:12:42,591 --> 01:12:46,260
I just can't, it's just
hard to even fathom the,

1138
01:12:46,270 --> 01:12:50,090
the mayhem when you're talking
about just all these B 40 rockets,

1139
01:12:50,091 --> 01:12:54,860
which is basically like
an RPG, an older RPG, um,

1140
01:12:55,770 --> 01:12:56,603
[inaudible].

1141
01:12:57,020 --> 01:12:57,853
It's crazy.

1142
01:12:59,270 --> 01:13:01,990
Going back to the book
with one final urgent Pola.

1143
01:13:02,270 --> 01:13:04,970
Turner was able to move himself upright
in the Swiss seat as the king bee

1144
01:13:04,971 --> 01:13:06,800
continued to climb higher into the sky,

1145
01:13:06,801 --> 01:13:11,300
distance could distancing itself from
the fear of exploding be 40 and AK 47

1146
01:13:11,301 --> 01:13:16,130
gunfire while gaining airspeed as the
king bee ascended the heavily sweating

1147
01:13:16,131 --> 01:13:20,780
Latino Clung to the rope as another
sensation overwhelmed his body chattering

1148
01:13:20,810 --> 01:13:21,643
teeth.

1149
01:13:21,890 --> 01:13:25,580
Within a matter of minutes that King Bee
had climbed to an altitude of more than

1150
01:13:25,581 --> 01:13:28,070
5,000 feet where the
air is thinner and much,

1151
01:13:28,071 --> 01:13:31,250
much colder than on the
jungle floor. So much colder.

1152
01:13:31,610 --> 01:13:35,750
That Latino's body began shaking violently
from the dipping temperatures as the

1153
01:13:35,751 --> 01:13:39,980
king bee continued to climb into the
safety of higher altitude in ordinary

1154
01:13:39,981 --> 01:13:40,701
circumstances,

1155
01:13:40,701 --> 01:13:43,790
few people would ever think about
freezing to death over Southeast Asia,

1156
01:13:43,970 --> 01:13:48,620
but for the men and CNC was just another
hurdle they had to clear as the king be

1157
01:13:48,621 --> 01:13:49,450
headed east,

1158
01:13:49,450 --> 01:13:52,250
we'll turn to look down on the spots
in the jungle that appeared to be good.

1159
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:54,620
LZs thinking, why don't you lay him there?

1160
01:13:55,370 --> 01:13:59,270
But St Virginia's collective
agony continued until the
king bees finally landed

1161
01:13:59,271 --> 01:14:03,170
in south Vietnam. By that time,
every member of SD, F, s, t,

1162
01:14:03,171 --> 01:14:05,870
Virginia had their circulation
cut off to their legs.

1163
01:14:05,871 --> 01:14:09,470
They couldn't stand or walk. All they
could do is unhook from their Swiss seat,

1164
01:14:09,590 --> 01:14:13,210
grabbed their stuff and try and get the
circulation going again in their legs

1165
01:14:13,330 --> 01:14:15,910
while the door gunner helped
them to get back to the king bee.

1166
01:14:17,050 --> 01:14:18,280
When the team returned to

1167
01:14:19,930 --> 01:14:24,730
Quang Tri Quang tree clung tree launch
site before heading south to food by

1168
01:14:24,820 --> 01:14:27,310
children's, pulled the
Tourneau aside and told him,

1169
01:14:27,490 --> 01:14:30,400
take good care of that radio. You're
going to take it on the next mission,

1170
01:14:30,401 --> 01:14:34,750
whether you like it or not. Where's he
gonna make you bring the shot up radio?

1171
01:14:34,780 --> 01:14:39,640
Yeah, he did. We did. It saved
his life tilts life in the end.

1172
01:14:39,970 --> 01:14:44,290
How's that? That Christmas Day,
Michigan. Okay. We had the Intel report.

1173
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:47,500
Was that the same radio you brought
a shot up radio in the field.

1174
01:14:50,860 --> 01:14:55,780
I got a hundred miles
to get out of it. Oh,

1175
01:14:55,781 --> 01:14:58,690
that's ridiculous. As darkness fell.

1176
01:14:58,691 --> 01:15:03,691
The King B's lifted off from crying
tree for free by when the old war boards

1177
01:15:04,120 --> 01:15:08,740
landed on fob one landing zone. St
Virginia was greeted by one man,

1178
01:15:09,070 --> 01:15:12,340
former s t, Virginia,
one zero John McGovern.

1179
01:15:13,150 --> 01:15:17,050
He greeted each of the team members as
they eggs exited the king bees asking

1180
01:15:17,051 --> 01:15:21,670
each one, are you okay? After the King
B's departed bathing them in sand,

1181
01:15:22,060 --> 01:15:26,830
dust and LZ debris kicked up by the
pro prop. Wash McGovern asked children,

1182
01:15:26,980 --> 01:15:31,900
did you hear about Baiter? A
tall children shook his head, no.

1183
01:15:31,901 --> 01:15:36,610
What happened November 13th we lost a
King Bee with seven SF troops on it.

1184
01:15:37,060 --> 01:15:38,920
We lost the entire King Bee crew.

1185
01:15:39,670 --> 01:15:43,270
They were a bunch of straphangers who
volunteered to pill pulling the elder son

1186
01:15:43,271 --> 01:15:44,620
mission on the trail,

1187
01:15:44,621 --> 01:15:47,860
but an anti aircraft round hit the
king be en route to the target.

1188
01:15:48,070 --> 01:15:50,920
It exploded in mid air.
They never had a chance

1189
01:15:52,570 --> 01:15:54,500
in silence. McGovern drove the tired,

1190
01:15:54,501 --> 01:15:57,070
dirty and hungry team
back to the team room.

1191
01:15:57,550 --> 01:15:59,770
As the Vietnamese team members
climbed off, the truck,

1192
01:15:59,771 --> 01:16:01,360
McGovern turned to Latino and said,

1193
01:16:01,750 --> 01:16:03,760
you know what was really
scary about that mission?

1194
01:16:03,940 --> 01:16:08,110
The day before they got shot
down. Me, Lynn Black, Rick Howard,

1195
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:09,790
John Peters, Tim Shaf,

1196
01:16:09,791 --> 01:16:14,080
and a few others had volunteered and
we're actually on the king bees suited up,

1197
01:16:14,081 --> 01:16:15,400
ready to go. Only to,

1198
01:16:15,510 --> 01:16:19,360
we canceled last minute
by bad whiskey X-ray,

1199
01:16:19,361 --> 01:16:22,180
which is weather in the AOE
that was too close for comfort.

1200
01:16:23,260 --> 01:16:27,460
After a long pars pause Latino, he asked
the Turno, how did it go out there?

1201
01:16:27,880 --> 01:16:30,310
I heard you were good on the
radio. You didn't get rattled.

1202
01:16:30,700 --> 01:16:35,170
You ain't a cheery no more. You've
joined a small, Unique Club of SF men,

1203
01:16:35,420 --> 01:16:38,470
C and c recon men who
went across the fence.

1204
01:16:39,490 --> 01:16:42,040
It was nothing like I ever
could have imagined to.

1205
01:16:42,041 --> 01:16:45,730
The terminal responded looking toward
the Vietnamese team members. He added,

1206
01:16:46,060 --> 01:16:48,880
let me get some chow for the
indigent. You will write about them.

1207
01:16:49,150 --> 01:16:53,350
They have ice in their veins. I'm
beat. I'll see you in the morning.

1208
01:16:54,160 --> 01:16:56,860
Latino walked through the
white sand to the mess hall,

1209
01:16:56,861 --> 01:16:59,770
picked up some fresh sandwiches
and cold sodas for the team.

1210
01:17:00,040 --> 01:17:03,700
After lingering with the Vietnamese
team members, Latino return to his room.

1211
01:17:03,820 --> 01:17:08,530
Finally taking off his rucksack and web
gear as he started to address Latino,

1212
01:17:08,531 --> 01:17:10,280
became aware of pain in his back

1213
01:17:10,820 --> 01:17:15,820
where from where the four AK 47 rounds
had slammed him face first into the

1214
01:17:15,831 --> 01:17:16,460
ground.

1215
01:17:16,460 --> 01:17:20,450
First he peeled off as jungle fatigued
shirt and was amazed to find four bullet

1216
01:17:20,451 --> 01:17:24,950
holes in it. Then he took
off his undershirt. Ditto.
Four bullet holes were in.

1217
01:17:24,951 --> 01:17:28,670
It lets her know, picked up his
rucksack. Four bullet holes were in it,

1218
01:17:29,300 --> 01:17:30,980
both in the front and the back,

1219
01:17:31,640 --> 01:17:33,770
something he hadn't realized
during the firefight.

1220
01:17:34,070 --> 01:17:38,450
Then he looked in the mirror and solve
for large welts and broken skin up his

1221
01:17:38,451 --> 01:17:42,620
spine where the AK 47 rounds had hit
his body after punching through his

1222
01:17:42,621 --> 01:17:47,621
rucksack and the PRC 25 only
then did a Latino begin to crump.

1223
01:17:47,961 --> 01:17:49,850
Comprehend just how lucky you had been.

1224
01:17:49,851 --> 01:17:54,800
Hours earlier in the day when the
NVA shot him in the back four times,

1225
01:17:55,460 --> 01:17:58,040
the turnover began to cut away the metal,

1226
01:17:58,070 --> 01:18:00,170
the black electrical
tape around his socks,

1227
01:18:00,171 --> 01:18:03,170
which he pulled up over his pant
legs. To keep out leeches and bugs.

1228
01:18:03,590 --> 01:18:07,820
Then he made a startling discovery when
he pulled his pant leg from the sock and

1229
01:18:07,821 --> 01:18:10,010
pulled off his right boot for AK.

1230
01:18:10,011 --> 01:18:13,940
47 bullets fell on the ground
in the heat of the battle.

1231
01:18:14,060 --> 01:18:17,140
The freshman didn't realize that
after you was shot in the back,

1232
01:18:17,160 --> 01:18:22,160
the four 7.62 millimeter NVA rounds had
fallen through his pants and his socks

1233
01:18:24,830 --> 01:18:25,880
into his right boot.

1234
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:29,990
He stood in utter amazement staring
at the four rounds on the floor before

1235
01:18:29,991 --> 01:18:33,380
picking them up and throwing them
in the sand outside his room,

1236
01:18:34,100 --> 01:18:37,730
exhausted Latino, walked
over to the shower room.

1237
01:18:37,850 --> 01:18:40,790
The water stung the wounds
in his back. Amazingly,

1238
01:18:40,791 --> 01:18:45,170
the four bullets had enough energy
to penetrate his skin, wounding him,

1239
01:18:45,410 --> 01:18:47,300
but not enough to get under his skin.

1240
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:52,010
Too tired to treat the four bullet wounds
in his back and trapping the wounds in

1241
01:18:52,011 --> 01:18:54,260
his arm. Laterno finished his shower

1242
01:18:55,580 --> 01:18:56,413
and went to bed

1243
01:19:00,580 --> 01:19:01,420
so that

1244
01:19:03,090 --> 01:19:04,900
that was mission number one.

1245
01:19:06,540 --> 01:19:11,100
There's a saying that we
came to realize later on,

1246
01:19:12,570 --> 01:19:16,270
everybody just look at you and say,
well, that's just another day in saga.

1247
01:19:19,260 --> 01:19:24,000
My first mission, I had to run
12 more before it was done.

1248
01:19:25,350 --> 01:19:27,720
And when you got done
with it, I mean will you,

1249
01:19:27,870 --> 01:19:30,330
will you talking to the other guys?
And they were telling you, hey, yeah,

1250
01:19:30,331 --> 01:19:31,890
that's, that's how it is.

1251
01:19:31,970 --> 01:19:34,130
Yes. That's how it is.
So he couldn't go in the,

1252
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:38,420
into the bar and go there and this
is what I did. Did you say? Yeah,

1253
01:19:38,421 --> 01:19:40,880
I got back. Well,

1254
01:19:40,881 --> 01:19:43,790
and don't forget the footnote
on that cause like about what,

1255
01:19:43,791 --> 01:19:46,490
four or five days later? The medics? Yeah.

1256
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:49,310
Tell him about the
wounds from the shrapnel.

1257
01:19:49,850 --> 01:19:54,800
Of course I had to ignore everything
because otherwise they'd all think I was,

1258
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:57,310
you know, just a looper, you know,

1259
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:01,130
so I just had to suck it up,

1260
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:03,950
not saying nothing and,

1261
01:20:03,951 --> 01:20:08,910
but all of a sudden I started getting
these boils on me. They were huge.

1262
01:20:09,480 --> 01:20:13,440
So I went to the medic and, and uh,

1263
01:20:14,970 --> 01:20:15,803
what's his name?

1264
01:20:17,030 --> 01:20:21,470
Majia NGO. Mazzeo says, well, he
says you got shrapnel in your buddy.

1265
01:20:21,480 --> 01:20:25,070
That's all. That's all swollen.
It's infecting you. He says,

1266
01:20:25,071 --> 01:20:27,980
you're going to have that for quite a
while until we can get every piece out of

1267
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:30,680
here. He says, I don't know
how many holes you got,

1268
01:20:30,681 --> 01:20:34,970
but this one here needs attention right
now. And it's huge. And there was a,

1269
01:20:34,971 --> 01:20:38,370
my arm, my arm, forearm actually. And uh,

1270
01:20:38,660 --> 01:20:42,650
he looked at the other
medic shipping and said,

1271
01:20:42,710 --> 01:20:45,410
hold him down. And he
looked at me and said,

1272
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:50,570
don't you look at what I'm doing?
Don't you turn your head? He said,

1273
01:20:51,080 --> 01:20:54,320
cause otherwise you're gonna pass out
on me when you see what I'm gonna do.

1274
01:20:54,970 --> 01:20:57,820
He said, so don't you look
and shipping you hold him,

1275
01:20:58,820 --> 01:21:01,430
hold him down and don't work
or they're going to pass out.

1276
01:21:01,670 --> 01:21:06,670
Well what he was doing was taking a
big stick swab in hydrogen peroxide and

1277
01:21:07,161 --> 01:21:09,710
burning a hole right
through the, the boil.

1278
01:21:10,160 --> 01:21:14,870
And then he took forceps and he pulled
the strings out with the shrapnel on the

1279
01:21:14,871 --> 01:21:17,900
end from the beef 40 rockets. Cause
they're all made. And you know, in China,

1280
01:21:18,020 --> 01:21:22,160
their Chai coms, you know, and
so they had a lot of string.

1281
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:25,610
That's how they wrapped them. They didn't
mold them in the metal like we did.

1282
01:21:26,180 --> 01:21:28,040
And so anyway,

1283
01:21:28,370 --> 01:21:31,430
I kept having to go and then
another day I had to go in,

1284
01:21:31,480 --> 01:21:35,390
he had to do the back of my head and I
had a couple in my head and then I had a

1285
01:21:35,391 --> 01:21:39,980
couple of my back and another under my
arm and I walked around with bandages

1286
01:21:40,100 --> 01:21:41,930
until I went out on my next mission.

1287
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:46,310
The witness one of those getting
pulled out and it was gross.

1288
01:21:48,170 --> 01:21:50,410
What were you doing? Just wanted
to, you know, Spec to spectate.

1289
01:21:50,470 --> 01:21:53,780
He had pulled several out. We kept hearing
about these things. Let me show you.

1290
01:21:54,140 --> 01:21:57,820
Oh thanks. They're talking
about TMI. Talk about Puss,

1291
01:21:59,850 --> 01:22:02,840
pimple breaker. But Hey, where you're
going to go back into the field anyways.

1292
01:22:02,990 --> 01:22:05,380
Yeah. It was like, Hey, it
doesn't matter if it, we'll do it.

1293
01:22:05,450 --> 01:22:09,140
We'll do what we can right now. But
exactly. Exact field. Yeah, exactly.

1294
01:22:09,470 --> 01:22:14,090
Cause we had another mission lined out
for Christmas of 68 so what was the

1295
01:22:14,091 --> 01:22:18,320
optempo like meeting? How
often would you, when you did,

1296
01:22:18,321 --> 01:22:21,210
you did your 13 missions,
how long did that take? What,

1297
01:22:21,220 --> 01:22:24,260
what time span was that over whatever
one year tour. One year tour.

1298
01:22:24,890 --> 01:22:26,900
I had 13 missions and one bright. Yeah,

1299
01:22:27,230 --> 01:22:31,230
like, and I, some day we'll talk
about the bright light, I guess.

1300
01:22:32,010 --> 01:22:36,720
Why not today? But then if you,
you know, it's a, it's a, uh,

1301
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:42,510
it's not written in the books
because of what it ended up being.

1302
01:22:43,140 --> 01:22:48,140
But a bright light in SOG is a volunteer
situation where a team of volunteer to

1303
01:22:49,051 --> 01:22:51,690
go in and get another team
out. This kid can't get out.

1304
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:57,270
And we had a lot of those. Or to
try to find a team that disappeared.

1305
01:22:57,330 --> 01:22:59,010
We had a lot of teams disappear.

1306
01:22:59,070 --> 01:23:02,850
I R t Idaho lane and Owen's
completely disappeared.

1307
01:23:03,010 --> 01:23:07,330
They've never been found to this day.
No trace, just completely off the bat.

1308
01:23:07,750 --> 01:23:12,070
People have gone into this day and hunt
the government hunts today and can't

1309
01:23:12,071 --> 01:23:16,970
find them under good circumstances. Are
these the guys that you took over for?

1310
01:23:17,180 --> 01:23:19,590
Yes. Yeah. And uh,

1311
01:23:19,690 --> 01:23:24,690
so when I got on the Idahoans transferred
from Virginia to Idaho cause tilt went

1312
01:23:25,781 --> 01:23:29,060
home and I became Lynn blacks one-on-one.

1313
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:35,290
Uh, one day he had been gone for
a while up at headquarters and I,

1314
01:23:35,380 --> 01:23:39,610
I always protected him cause I'm the
one, one I I protected my one zeros.

1315
01:23:40,300 --> 01:23:45,300
I had to know where they were doing all
the time cause you just never knew cause

1316
01:23:45,851 --> 01:23:49,340
we had, we had nuns, we had Cambodia,

1317
01:23:49,960 --> 01:23:53,230
we had mountain yards, we
had Vietnamese in our camp.

1318
01:23:53,800 --> 01:23:58,150
They all fought amongst themselves, let
alone wondering if they're the enemy.

1319
01:23:58,151 --> 01:24:03,100
And we also had an entire
team of NVA Choo Hoy's too.

1320
01:24:03,101 --> 01:24:03,731
Always been,

1321
01:24:03,731 --> 01:24:08,731
they gave up and that was team Cobra
and they were there for a very special

1322
01:24:09,461 --> 01:24:14,461
mission that they went on and to get
us prisoners out of a camp that was

1323
01:24:15,820 --> 01:24:20,320
located. But we got a call,

1324
01:24:20,920 --> 01:24:23,050
Lynn went up to the headquarters
and had been a little while.

1325
01:24:23,051 --> 01:24:24,760
So I went up there to
see what was going on.

1326
01:24:24,760 --> 01:24:29,760
He's walking back down and says
can we go on a bright light?

1327
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:34,060
I said we're ready. We're packed.
Cause that's just what you did.

1328
01:24:34,620 --> 01:24:38,560
If you were asked, you went,
he said we got two pilots down

1329
01:24:40,260 --> 01:24:44,140
and we in there, we think
they're alive. We got to go in.

1330
01:24:45,190 --> 01:24:47,890
They brought a jolly
green giant in for us,

1331
01:24:48,490 --> 01:24:50,410
which is very unusual air force.

1332
01:24:51,550 --> 01:24:56,550
I don't know where they really took
us at this point in time in my life.

1333
01:24:56,621 --> 01:25:00,610
I, we still don't know. They
have all kinds of records,

1334
01:25:00,611 --> 01:25:03,190
but it's very confusing of where we went.

1335
01:25:03,930 --> 01:25:08,710
We came in and that jolly when we
circled over the top of the plane,

1336
01:25:10,210 --> 01:25:14,230
it was all intact. It was just
sitting there in elephant grass.

1337
01:25:15,610 --> 01:25:17,170
No one could figure out why.

1338
01:25:18,580 --> 01:25:21,700
So they brought us down and I jumped out.

1339
01:25:22,390 --> 01:25:23,590
But when I jumped out,

1340
01:25:24,850 --> 01:25:29,560
there was a slight lift in the
plane and in the jolly green.

1341
01:25:30,070 --> 01:25:33,970
Uh, and it just came down back
down on me about crushed me.

1342
01:25:34,900 --> 01:25:38,680
And then it came back up and then Lynn
jumped out and mar guys jumped out and

1343
01:25:38,681 --> 01:25:43,210
each I knew and it was an oh two was a
push pull Sesno engine in the front and

1344
01:25:43,211 --> 01:25:45,670
engine in the back. That's where
it had been shot down. Yeah.

1345
01:25:46,150 --> 01:25:49,540
We think it was shot down. We don't,
or crashed town [inaudible] however,

1346
01:25:49,541 --> 01:25:50,950
we just don't know how it happened.

1347
01:25:51,370 --> 01:25:56,170
But what the real deal was is the plane,

1348
01:25:56,590 --> 01:25:57,880
whatever happened to it,

1349
01:25:57,910 --> 01:26:02,910
was making an emergency landing and he
saw this opening like an LLC and thought

1350
01:26:05,300 --> 01:26:07,970
this would be a good place to
at least start the landing.

1351
01:26:08,360 --> 01:26:13,040
Even if it went into the jungle,
it would slow it down. Problem was,

1352
01:26:13,310 --> 01:26:14,600
as soon as they hit the ground,

1353
01:26:14,601 --> 01:26:19,370
there was a bowl and they hit the front
of the bowl with the front engine and

1354
01:26:19,371 --> 01:26:23,720
stopped dead like a bird track.
It was a bird. Yeah. And uh,

1355
01:26:24,530 --> 01:26:28,130
it stopped it dead, but it bent
the engine around to the right.

1356
01:26:28,340 --> 01:26:32,420
And the man in the right seat was
sucked up into the carburetors,

1357
01:26:32,930 --> 01:26:35,780
into the lie comb engine. And, uh,

1358
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:39,200
he was in the fins and he just had
his head in his arms sticking out.

1359
01:26:39,530 --> 01:26:42,380
Said when I got there on that side,

1360
01:26:42,680 --> 01:26:47,150
it said 10 minutes after 10 in the
morning is Rolex watch was cracked,

1361
01:26:47,151 --> 01:26:51,080
the Bezel was cracked, and it
stopped the watch at 10 after 10.

1362
01:26:51,560 --> 01:26:55,580
And we didn't get there
until about two 30. Well,

1363
01:26:55,670 --> 01:26:59,090
don't forget when the chopper's going
down. You're under fire. Yeah. And it's,

1364
01:26:59,430 --> 01:27:01,730
we're, we're getting some small arms fire.

1365
01:27:02,300 --> 01:27:04,340
And Lynn goes to the pilot side on the,

1366
01:27:04,341 --> 01:27:09,020
on the left side and he looked fine,

1367
01:27:09,680 --> 01:27:13,940
but we realize that yolk had crushed
his chest and killed him in place.

1368
01:27:13,941 --> 01:27:17,930
But it also had him trapped and
we couldn't get either one out.

1369
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:22,550
But at that point in time
that was a trap they'd set.

1370
01:27:23,330 --> 01:27:28,330
The jolly green had backed off and we
started taking tremendous amount of of

1371
01:27:30,160 --> 01:27:34,070
fire. And I looked across
the inside of the cabinet.

1372
01:27:34,071 --> 01:27:38,270
Lynn Lynn looked back at me
and I said, I love you brother.

1373
01:27:38,480 --> 01:27:42,080
We're not getting out of this.
And he, he said, no, we're not.

1374
01:27:42,890 --> 01:27:45,290
This is it finally got us.

1375
01:27:47,690 --> 01:27:52,690
And I looked up and radio the Johnny
Green to come back in and he shook his

1376
01:27:53,811 --> 01:27:57,500
head. I could see him plain
as day. He shook his head,

1377
01:27:57,650 --> 01:28:00,290
I don't think I can come back. I said,

1378
01:28:00,291 --> 01:28:02,900
you better cause I got
an m 79 pointed at you.

1379
01:28:04,280 --> 01:28:07,760
I'll take you down with
us. He moved up forward.

1380
01:28:09,020 --> 01:28:11,900
By that time, there was
200 NBA surrounding us,

1381
01:28:13,480 --> 01:28:14,480
given it everything they got.

1382
01:28:15,290 --> 01:28:20,000
And we managed to crawl into that chopper
cause if we got up on the wings and he

1383
01:28:20,300 --> 01:28:24,800
scooped us up and I had already called
in tech here cause they already had tech

1384
01:28:25,070 --> 01:28:25,903
care ready.

1385
01:28:26,810 --> 01:28:31,100
And as we lifted off and got
up about 50 feet and they,

1386
01:28:31,101 --> 01:28:36,101
one sped flew right underneath us between
the plane and in the chopper and I,

1387
01:28:39,930 --> 01:28:41,510
he looked up at me like this

1388
01:28:43,130 --> 01:28:48,130
was smiling and he dropped a WP right
on top of him and there was crispy

1389
01:28:49,881 --> 01:28:51,230
critters running everywhere.

1390
01:28:52,700 --> 01:28:56,090
And we got out of there and
got back and we walked down,

1391
01:28:56,210 --> 01:29:01,210
landed us back at fob four and we walked
down the road back to our hooch and we

1392
01:29:06,061 --> 01:29:08,280
just looked at each other
and said another day and saw

1393
01:29:10,430 --> 01:29:13,430
time. They're on the ground,
they, they're under fire going in.

1394
01:29:13,970 --> 01:29:18,970
They put a perimeter around the aircraft
while Lynn and Doug went in to try to

1395
01:29:18,981 --> 01:29:21,440
establish what the
status of the pilots war.

1396
01:29:21,860 --> 01:29:26,860
And the firefight was intense
because I remember when I got back,

1397
01:29:27,560 --> 01:29:32,560
Doug had just left and I came back to
Nava at the end of October 69 so that

1398
01:29:32,571 --> 01:29:37,571
bright light was fresh on Lynn's mind and
we talked about it and I talked to hep

1399
01:29:39,290 --> 01:29:41,210
later about that Riley and her going,

1400
01:29:41,240 --> 01:29:45,950
this was crazy cause hap Saudi went in
with four and ditch from a RTI to own

1401
01:29:45,951 --> 01:29:50,750
that team. And Lynn was like, man, I
don't even know how we got out of there.

1402
01:29:51,680 --> 01:29:54,320
So it was one of those real,
another just a really tight one.

1403
01:29:54,321 --> 01:29:55,520
But like Doug says,

1404
01:29:55,580 --> 01:29:59,750
in a way when you now in retrospect
like had just another day in SOG,

1405
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:02,840
but that wouldn't really stuck.

1406
01:30:03,880 --> 01:30:04,713
Yeah,

1407
01:30:05,350 --> 01:30:10,350
I just thought that out of all my missions
and if you read the book and where

1408
01:30:12,160 --> 01:30:17,110
tilt honors me with a few missions in
his books between across the fence and on

1409
01:30:17,111 --> 01:30:17,950
the ground,

1410
01:30:18,910 --> 01:30:23,910
that when there was is as tense as it
got and we thought it was over physically

1411
01:30:24,641 --> 01:30:26,050
and mentally we gave up.

1412
01:30:26,110 --> 01:30:30,610
We thought it was over that
we just weren't going to
get up out of that mess and

1413
01:30:30,611 --> 01:30:34,630
get into that shopper than be 40 rockets
were hitting that plate underneath that

1414
01:30:34,631 --> 01:30:35,464
jolly green.

1415
01:30:35,770 --> 01:30:39,580
We were going up in the air faster than
the chopper could get us up in the air

1416
01:30:39,850 --> 01:30:42,760
from the pounding. We were taken
that hadn't been for that span.

1417
01:30:42,790 --> 01:30:46,570
We might not have to this day,
we can't find this bad pilot.

1418
01:30:47,940 --> 01:30:50,320
We'd have reunions we
go to as bad reunions,

1419
01:30:50,321 --> 01:30:53,290
but we still haven't been able to
find that sped pilot that did that.

1420
01:30:53,730 --> 01:30:55,950
Cause what he's saying is like when
the John Green's pulling out the,

1421
01:30:55,951 --> 01:30:58,630
before he pounded underneath
and the armor plating,

1422
01:30:58,650 --> 01:31:03,330
he could sustain it and it w but it would
give the chopper Joel like Lynn Black

1423
01:31:03,330 --> 01:31:05,830
Hat on October 5th and this
is what they're experiencing

1424
01:31:07,170 --> 01:31:10,950
one October a year later saying,
yeah, yeah, exactly. Yup.

1425
01:31:11,890 --> 01:31:14,980
I'm surprised that they take
those B 40 strikes like that.

1426
01:31:14,981 --> 01:31:19,570
I mean one lucky shot that hits the tail
rotor or something and it's just game

1427
01:31:19,571 --> 01:31:22,780
over. Sure. You know when
we get back on missions,

1428
01:31:22,781 --> 01:31:27,781
we'd walk around our King Bees and count
how many bullet holes and how many were

1429
01:31:28,391 --> 01:31:33,150
in the blades. We did, there's clean
shots through the blades and then we,

1430
01:31:33,370 --> 01:31:37,240
we'd caught 40 50 80 rounds in
king bees when we come back.

1431
01:31:38,200 --> 01:31:41,980
And pieces of metal gone that
they had to put tin over.

1432
01:31:43,240 --> 01:31:46,890
They use beer cans. Yeah.
Aluminum beer cans. Yeah.

1433
01:31:50,860 --> 01:31:54,340
And what about the, um, what
about that operation where you,

1434
01:31:54,370 --> 01:31:59,080
we had to go and get the 55 gallon
drum of [inaudible] and pull that one.

1435
01:32:00,910 --> 01:32:05,680
Yeah. Okay. We'll go through that.

1436
01:32:05,681 --> 01:32:07,540
Somebody would probably
like to read it in the book,

1437
01:32:07,541 --> 01:32:10,450
but we'll kind of go through
that. We were trained,

1438
01:32:11,560 --> 01:32:16,560
we had a CIA agent come in and trainers
for a brand new explosive detonator.

1439
01:32:18,550 --> 01:32:23,550
That was a time device that was shaped
on the top end of the Bung of a 55 gallon

1440
01:32:26,051 --> 01:32:30,910
drum as curls. You put a
wrench on it and unscrew it.

1441
01:32:31,060 --> 01:32:34,310
You've seen them. And we said,

1442
01:32:34,420 --> 01:32:36,650
this is, by the way, this
is a seal type missing.

1443
01:32:36,651 --> 01:32:39,790
So you really appreciate this more.
Absolutely. Yeah. When I read about it,

1444
01:32:40,300 --> 01:32:44,530
I was like, man, this is a good
seal mission. Yeah. But, oh well.

1445
01:32:45,910 --> 01:32:46,890
Well they didn't want to see that.

1446
01:32:46,900 --> 01:32:47,860
Let's do that in those days,

1447
01:32:49,780 --> 01:32:53,270
Huh? No, they're busy on the coast.
Yeah. They're busy on the coast.

1448
01:32:53,271 --> 01:32:57,410
They really were. We under this, I mean,
everything up to that isn't a jungle,

1449
01:32:57,470 --> 01:32:58,670
obviously you get to the river boat.

1450
01:32:58,790 --> 01:32:59,623
Exactly.

1451
01:32:59,810 --> 01:33:04,300
But we actually went into secret, uh,

1452
01:33:04,440 --> 01:33:09,260
lock up, uh, couldn't talk to anybody.
Nobody could come in and talk to us.

1453
01:33:09,261 --> 01:33:13,700
And we went through these exercises
and training. We actually,

1454
01:33:14,870 --> 01:33:18,440
uh, loaded up for it and
they took us out to the,

1455
01:33:18,950 --> 01:33:23,950
and took us to a Kang tree and
we launched out of there and uh,

1456
01:33:24,500 --> 01:33:28,670
went into layoffs into this
huge river that they had,

1457
01:33:28,671 --> 01:33:30,650
but we had to stay away from it.

1458
01:33:30,770 --> 01:33:34,550
We had to actually hike in
for two days to get to it.

1459
01:33:35,570 --> 01:33:39,800
And when we got there and down
the hill and to the river,

1460
01:33:40,160 --> 01:33:43,670
it was night on the second
end of the second day.

1461
01:33:44,540 --> 01:33:48,890
And then Gunther was my one
zero and I was as one one.

1462
01:33:48,920 --> 01:33:52,100
There was no one, one, two and uh,

1463
01:33:53,720 --> 01:33:58,580
he was an ex marine and he
was an east six. And uh,

1464
01:33:59,270 --> 01:34:03,340
he was my one Siro he'd
been around a while and uh,

1465
01:34:04,430 --> 01:34:07,790
he says, okay, go in and get that drum.
And I says, well, you're the marine,

1466
01:34:09,010 --> 01:34:12,620
you're navy. Why should I
go it? Cause you're the one,

1467
01:34:14,120 --> 01:34:15,620
you're the, you're the one one

1468
01:34:17,630 --> 01:34:21,410
the European IFC and I'm an six.
So that's how it's going down.

1469
01:34:21,970 --> 01:34:23,930
And don't forget before you get there,

1470
01:34:24,530 --> 01:34:29,530
they hiked through jungle for two days
and two nights right to meet the CIA.

1471
01:34:30,470 --> 01:34:35,330
I forgot that. Who gave them the
specialized chart where he come from?

1472
01:34:36,410 --> 01:34:39,680
He had Chinese with him and he said,

1473
01:34:39,920 --> 01:34:44,480
I will meet you out there to give you
this device because I can't trust anybody

1474
01:34:44,660 --> 01:34:49,190
to have this device in case you're
caught between now and then. And I said,

1475
01:34:49,191 --> 01:34:53,570
there's no way we're going to find you
out there. This is impossible. He says,

1476
01:34:53,571 --> 01:34:57,860
don't you worry about it, you get to
this coordinate and I will, I will

1477
01:34:58,070 --> 01:35:01,070
find you. That's impressive. And he did.

1478
01:35:01,790 --> 01:35:04,820
We got that coordinate and we waited
and we waited and next thing we know he

1479
01:35:04,821 --> 01:35:08,930
come right out of the jungle and there
he was. We were going to kill him.

1480
01:35:09,050 --> 01:35:12,080
We thought was NBA. Yeah,
of course. Chinese with

1481
01:35:15,710 --> 01:35:19,560
Zola. Nautilus was his name, if you
pronounce it right, I probably do.

1482
01:35:19,561 --> 01:35:23,300
I can't pronounce it right,
and spelling. It was,

1483
01:35:25,070 --> 01:35:28,400
he actually was a renegade CIA agent.

1484
01:35:28,550 --> 01:35:33,550
He was a desk jockey that wanted to
prove that he could be an infield agent.

1485
01:35:34,670 --> 01:35:39,560
As the story finally went that we didn't
learn about this until what about 12

1486
01:35:39,561 --> 01:35:44,310
years ago and we asked
did you meet him later?

1487
01:35:44,580 --> 01:35:48,230
No, no, no, no, no one knows where
he went or what happened to him.

1488
01:35:48,590 --> 01:35:50,530
We met another CIA we needed,

1489
01:35:50,900 --> 01:35:55,900
that was actually a counterpart to a
Russian KGB agent that when they di rush a

1490
01:36:00,320 --> 01:36:00,680
deep,

1491
01:36:00,680 --> 01:36:05,680
finally admitted and declassified the
Vietnam War and admitted they had 3000

1492
01:36:07,220 --> 01:36:10,610
Russians helping the, the NBA,

1493
01:36:11,630 --> 01:36:15,890
and they had a reunion and they
did an actual video of the reunion,

1494
01:36:15,920 --> 01:36:20,920
admitting that they had worked with the
NVA and the Chinese and helping the,

1495
01:36:22,730 --> 01:36:27,440
the NVA go up and down
the Holcim in trail. Well,

1496
01:36:29,630 --> 01:36:34,340
this Zola NAACOS had figured this
out and got ahold of this device.

1497
01:36:35,630 --> 01:36:36,463
And

1498
01:36:38,300 --> 01:36:43,300
how we learned about it was this CIA
agent had gone there and help declassify

1499
01:36:46,190 --> 01:36:50,720
all the records of special
ops stuff that was, they were,

1500
01:36:50,840 --> 01:36:54,740
they had located. And the hole here,

1501
01:36:54,741 --> 01:36:59,150
they found my name in the
KGB at files in Moscow twice.

1502
01:36:59,570 --> 01:37:04,400
My code name and my real name
and the missions that I ran.

1503
01:37:06,080 --> 01:37:10,520
They did that twice. And they
found Lynn because we bumped into,

1504
01:37:11,690 --> 01:37:13,130
uh, what we,

1505
01:37:13,340 --> 01:37:17,000
I thought was a Mexican
Spanish speaking person,

1506
01:37:17,150 --> 01:37:20,540
speaking broken English. And
I'm from California, right.

1507
01:37:21,020 --> 01:37:26,020
And I go back to my old
days and I told Lynn,

1508
01:37:26,181 --> 01:37:29,390
I said this, this guy's
a Mexican gotta be,

1509
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:33,590
what the Hell is he doing out here?
And he's talking to us on the radio,

1510
01:37:33,591 --> 01:37:37,420
he's got our frequency. And Glen
says, give me that football on it.

1511
01:37:37,421 --> 01:37:42,290
So he goes back and forth with him and
he says, you got to move out of the area.

1512
01:37:42,530 --> 01:37:45,110
And he says, I'm not going to move
out of the area. I'm here to stay.

1513
01:37:45,111 --> 01:37:48,620
Here's my coordinates. He'd given
a five digit coordinate. No,

1514
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:51,380
what are you going to do? He says,
well, nothing, but you need to move out.

1515
01:37:51,740 --> 01:37:56,070
He was trying to save our butts cause
he, he was from Angola, was a Cuban,

1516
01:37:57,740 --> 01:37:59,340
stationed in Angola and had been shifted,

1517
01:37:59,660 --> 01:38:04,410
loyal Laos and then turned around
and he hated the Vietnamese so much.

1518
01:38:04,411 --> 01:38:05,610
He was trying to help us,

1519
01:38:07,050 --> 01:38:10,830
but we could see him on the other side
of the river that where we were at on

1520
01:38:10,831 --> 01:38:12,180
this particular mission.

1521
01:38:12,720 --> 01:38:17,720
And so that mission was in the KGB files
that we had spoke to him and he had

1522
01:38:18,260 --> 01:38:21,120
our, and they knew it was RTI Edo
and that we knew it was linen me.

1523
01:38:22,230 --> 01:38:24,390
And so they are they at as much,

1524
01:38:24,630 --> 01:38:28,160
cause we had spies in Saigon
giving all this information out to,

1525
01:38:28,290 --> 01:38:32,670
he had a spy that, that uh,
they finally caught an American,

1526
01:38:33,240 --> 01:38:36,720
it was giving all this information
now, but for two missions,

1527
01:38:36,721 --> 01:38:40,800
I'm in the KGB files. So
on this oil drum mission,

1528
01:38:41,040 --> 01:38:46,040
we get down there after we've been given
the device and night and I go in and I

1529
01:38:49,020 --> 01:38:52,350
grab a hold of a drum and of course
they have those little lips on there.

1530
01:38:52,410 --> 01:38:56,610
I can pull that drum it in there full
about three quarters because they gotta be

1531
01:38:56,611 --> 01:38:57,444
buoyant.

1532
01:38:58,110 --> 01:39:02,370
And I bring that fueled drum right
to the side and I'm holding it there.

1533
01:39:02,820 --> 01:39:06,360
And Gunther unscrews it,

1534
01:39:07,310 --> 01:39:11,400
the bung off and puts the new
one in, screws it up tight.

1535
01:39:11,490 --> 01:39:16,380
Now I've got to get that drum back
out into the flow while the flow is

1536
01:39:17,880 --> 01:39:22,470
NBA walking it down with bamboo
poles, pushing them around.

1537
01:39:23,040 --> 01:39:27,540
So I get it out there, but I can't
get back because here they come.

1538
01:39:28,230 --> 01:39:31,980
So I had to go under and hold my breath,
but I can't hold my breath that long.

1539
01:39:32,570 --> 01:39:34,380
And this water is ice cold. Right.

1540
01:39:35,130 --> 01:39:40,130
But fortunately I was a great
swimmer in my youth and I,

1541
01:39:40,621 --> 01:39:42,390
I could, I could handle this,

1542
01:39:42,660 --> 01:39:47,660
but I could get my nose just above the
surface blowout and take a breath and go

1543
01:39:49,111 --> 01:39:51,900
back under. But cause it's dark

1544
01:39:53,820 --> 01:39:55,410
and they went on by me finally.

1545
01:39:55,411 --> 01:39:58,890
But I thought for sure they'd
stick me with the one of the Poles.

1546
01:39:59,130 --> 01:40:02,100
But they pushed that drum on down in
the few drums that were around me.

1547
01:40:02,490 --> 01:40:06,750
And I came back to the edge and
crawled out. But I was so cold,

1548
01:40:06,751 --> 01:40:09,630
I could hardly move. I'm
soaking wet of course.

1549
01:40:10,290 --> 01:40:13,080
And Guthrie says, come on, we got to go.

1550
01:40:13,680 --> 01:40:18,680
And I finally put my gear back on my
rucksack and the radio and my web gear and

1551
01:40:20,161 --> 01:40:22,590
everything else back on
and up the hill. We go,

1552
01:40:22,591 --> 01:40:26,730
but I'm still just barely making it,
just barely making it. I'm so stiff.

1553
01:40:27,150 --> 01:40:30,990
And uh, we crawled out of
there. Took two days to get out.

1554
01:40:30,991 --> 01:40:35,490
But that device was set for two
days, but they hadn't gone off yet.

1555
01:40:35,700 --> 01:40:40,230
But we finally got extraction orders in
and they came and got us and strung us

1556
01:40:40,231 --> 01:40:44,250
out. And when we were
on strings, it went off.

1557
01:40:44,400 --> 01:40:48,360
The cubby rider was there
and it was like an atom bomb.

1558
01:40:48,361 --> 01:40:53,100
It was a miniature
mushroom. And the shockwave,

1559
01:40:53,320 --> 01:40:54,940
even though we were miles away,

1560
01:40:55,150 --> 01:41:00,150
came through us on strings and the
choppers and just like this and we're,

1561
01:41:00,840 --> 01:41:04,000
we're going like this back and forth and,

1562
01:41:04,680 --> 01:41:05,880
and the chopper and the,

1563
01:41:06,180 --> 01:41:10,030
and the Covey plane is shaking like this.

1564
01:41:10,120 --> 01:41:12,820
And I mean it was like an atomic
bomb just went through us.

1565
01:41:13,090 --> 01:41:14,470
What you picture when you see,

1566
01:41:14,980 --> 01:41:18,570
and then then everything
became calm and, uh,

1567
01:41:19,210 --> 01:41:23,670
mission completed. That's a good one.
That's a real good, that's a good.

1568
01:41:24,870 --> 01:41:28,840
So they never knew, never knew. Well,
they didn't know until the Russians knew.

1569
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:30,070
Yeah. But other than that,

1570
01:41:30,071 --> 01:41:34,150
they never knew who w and we weren't
allowed to talk or tell anybody in camp

1571
01:41:34,151 --> 01:41:38,470
when we got back, they just, what were
you doing? Oh, just another day in song.

1572
01:41:39,670 --> 01:41:41,050
And that was what we said,

1573
01:41:41,470 --> 01:41:45,220
because we weren't even allowed to tell
anybody what we did because of the CIA

1574
01:41:45,221 --> 01:41:47,290
mission that we ran. But we,

1575
01:41:47,410 --> 01:41:50,260
everybody had certain things
that they did like that,

1576
01:41:51,040 --> 01:41:53,290
but it was the first time it
had ever been accomplished.

1577
01:41:54,040 --> 01:41:59,040
What did you notice about the one
zeros that you had from a leadership

1578
01:41:59,501 --> 01:42:03,430
perspective that you remember
as like, yeah, this is,

1579
01:42:03,431 --> 01:42:04,690
this is the quality,

1580
01:42:04,691 --> 01:42:08,410
some of the qualities that they had from
a leadership perspective that you would

1581
01:42:08,590 --> 01:42:13,210
follow them. Uh, I was most fortunate.

1582
01:42:13,270 --> 01:42:16,180
I think I had great ones. Zeros,

1583
01:42:17,110 --> 01:42:21,850
some of them not as
great as others. But, uh,

1584
01:42:23,650 --> 01:42:25,120
when you, my first one,

1585
01:42:26,080 --> 01:42:31,080
he was my idol because my
first two missions and,

1586
01:42:31,690 --> 01:42:36,460
uh, thanksgiving of of
68 and Christmas a 68.

1587
01:42:37,070 --> 01:42:40,870
And you can't ever forget
those, you know? And uh,

1588
01:42:41,800 --> 01:42:43,480
so fact,

1589
01:42:43,570 --> 01:42:48,570
the mission of 68 is where I got the
skip from the bloat up radio that let him

1590
01:42:50,561 --> 01:42:54,400
know he was walking into an edge letting
tilt know that he was walking into an

1591
01:42:54,401 --> 01:42:55,234
ambush.

1592
01:42:56,860 --> 01:43:01,860
And I'm laying on a trail with
the radio on and heard this.

1593
01:43:04,060 --> 01:43:06,790
My interpreter comes up and
interprets what's going on.

1594
01:43:07,210 --> 01:43:09,160
I managed to get ahold of spider parks.

1595
01:43:10,060 --> 01:43:13,360
He just had me going by for a radio
check and I told him what was going on.

1596
01:43:13,570 --> 01:43:18,570
He radios to the tilt to turn around
and go back that he had intel and tilts

1597
01:43:18,700 --> 01:43:19,533
going. What?

1598
01:43:20,580 --> 01:43:23,910
Yeah, it was the first time I've
ever had like a direct Intel report.

1599
01:43:23,970 --> 01:43:26,640
Do not go through the northeast.
This is the Christmas Day mission.

1600
01:43:26,730 --> 01:43:30,840
We were on top of that knoll
and Lynn and I had talked about,

1601
01:43:31,170 --> 01:43:33,900
that was the one quiet area
of probably there's a problem,

1602
01:43:34,380 --> 01:43:37,860
but we were talking that spider goes
do not go through the northeast.

1603
01:43:37,861 --> 01:43:40,130
We have an Intel report. Do not go there.

1604
01:43:40,140 --> 01:43:45,140
I'm the only Intel report
that never happened before
or after on a live mission.

1605
01:43:45,451 --> 01:43:48,870
We're on the ground and we
didn't know what the hell it was,

1606
01:43:48,871 --> 01:43:50,160
but they were right.

1607
01:43:51,350 --> 01:43:54,260
We did and you noticed or we could
extract as it were back in base.

1608
01:43:54,261 --> 01:43:58,760
A few days later, him and bubba
connect and it's going like, yeah,

1609
01:43:58,761 --> 01:44:02,960
what were you on the ground at Christmas?
And then we found out is that, uh,

1610
01:44:03,080 --> 01:44:07,550
he had that Intel report
that was confirmed the one
place we could have gone.

1611
01:44:07,551 --> 01:44:09,560
We shouldn't have, our
instincts were right,

1612
01:44:09,561 --> 01:44:13,940
but we had a confirmation from the
Intel report and it was just amazing.

1613
01:44:14,840 --> 01:44:16,640
You know, he says to this day,

1614
01:44:17,640 --> 01:44:21,600
they got out of it and due to
other factors they got out of it,

1615
01:44:21,601 --> 01:44:26,190
but just that it saved the team was
walking into an l shape, ambushed,

1616
01:44:26,330 --> 01:44:28,320
and they've been
slaughtered. And they were,

1617
01:44:28,590 --> 01:44:33,420
they were pushing them that
way with trackers, gunfire
and everything else. And,

1618
01:44:33,720 --> 01:44:38,190
uh, so they just, just like you say,
the gods were always with us sometimes.

1619
01:44:38,610 --> 01:44:42,690
But, uh, at that very next day,

1620
01:44:43,200 --> 01:44:45,450
I'm still on the trail
where we were signed.

1621
01:44:45,451 --> 01:44:49,230
That was the trail for my very first
mission. We got into north Vietnam,

1622
01:44:49,231 --> 01:44:51,150
into it. We called nickel steel.

1623
01:44:51,600 --> 01:44:56,550
And I'd been laying there for four days
through this process. And Gunther was a,

1624
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:58,610
I mean, children's was, uh,

1625
01:44:58,680 --> 01:45:03,150
my one zero and we were
taking turns and uh,

1626
01:45:03,750 --> 01:45:08,750
it had been defoliated with Agent Orange
and so we had a pretty good view and

1627
01:45:11,880 --> 01:45:16,560
all of a sudden I saw
six pointman coming up.

1628
01:45:17,430 --> 01:45:22,320
MBA. I'm up there at the trail
behind the log. They're down below.

1629
01:45:22,500 --> 01:45:25,470
I give them the signal,
I give them the signal,

1630
01:45:25,471 --> 01:45:30,300
I got six and I can see him and children's
right away, he knows what's going on.

1631
01:45:30,480 --> 01:45:35,480
So he's preparing the team to fight
and exfil out of the situation,

1632
01:45:37,110 --> 01:45:39,540
but he can't with me up above.

1633
01:45:39,870 --> 01:45:42,540
But here comes one of the NVA.

1634
01:45:43,140 --> 01:45:46,260
He comes right up to the log and
steps over and steps right on me.

1635
01:45:46,860 --> 01:45:50,970
I put my car 15 into his belly and
I pull the trigger all 20 rounds.

1636
01:45:51,540 --> 01:45:54,480
I made a big, gapping hold
all the way through him,

1637
01:45:54,930 --> 01:45:58,080
threw him over the log and I'm on the run

1638
01:45:59,640 --> 01:46:04,640
and I've got the radio and down the
hill we go and here comes 200 in VA

1639
01:46:07,830 --> 01:46:11,980
and there point Jason is, and
we're, we're bringing, um,

1640
01:46:12,180 --> 01:46:15,210
I'm trying to get TAC air on
the line. I finally do. We're,

1641
01:46:15,360 --> 01:46:18,840
we're putting tack here between them
and us and I'm throwing smoke over my

1642
01:46:18,841 --> 01:46:23,630
shoulder. Yes. Anything,
anything in the smoke killer.

1643
01:46:24,990 --> 01:46:29,930
And finally they bring some
slips in and pull us out and uh,

1644
01:46:30,600 --> 01:46:35,490
get us out of there on strings,
on strings again and on the run.

1645
01:46:35,850 --> 01:46:40,440
And so the side note to
the whole mission is,

1646
01:46:41,510 --> 01:46:45,300
I don't know how many we killed,
but it was not a good day for them,

1647
01:46:46,190 --> 01:46:49,380
but that agent orange was
the only time I was ever it.

1648
01:46:49,920 --> 01:46:54,920
And right now I've got stage four cancer
from Agent Orange with a limited amount

1649
01:46:55,621 --> 01:46:56,580
of time left.

1650
01:46:57,780 --> 01:47:00,930
So that's why I'm glad
I'm here to tell them

1651
01:47:01,150 --> 01:47:04,120
new stories. Glad you're here to airborne

1652
01:47:06,160 --> 01:47:10,090
the um, so how many tours did you do?

1653
01:47:10,091 --> 01:47:12,220
Was that w one tour?

1654
01:47:13,720 --> 01:47:14,620
I signed up for one,

1655
01:47:14,650 --> 01:47:19,130
I volunteered to go into special
forces when I was regular army.

1656
01:47:19,150 --> 01:47:21,880
I volunteered regular army, went
through, got special forces,

1657
01:47:22,510 --> 01:47:27,170
volunteered Vietnam, volunteered
for CCN and saw og and, and uh,

1658
01:47:27,250 --> 01:47:30,280
did one tour and I went back home and uh,

1659
01:47:30,310 --> 01:47:35,310
became a weapons instructor for
Special Forces Training Group and uh,

1660
01:47:35,740 --> 01:47:39,550
and got out. And so how many years
was the total? Three, three years.

1661
01:47:39,610 --> 01:47:44,020
Three years. That was it. And
then what'd you do when you,

1662
01:47:44,170 --> 01:47:46,420
when you got out? Uh,

1663
01:47:46,720 --> 01:47:50,190
I kind of went back to Rodeo and uh,

1664
01:47:50,590 --> 01:47:55,140
training horses and things
like that. And then, uh,

1665
01:47:55,510 --> 01:47:57,700
I sorta got calm.

1666
01:48:00,900 --> 01:48:04,830
Got Your Pos license? Yeah, I got my
pilots license, fixed wing and rotary.

1667
01:48:05,010 --> 01:48:05,843
Where you got home.

1668
01:48:05,860 --> 01:48:09,630
How long did it take till kind
of adapt to the civilian life?

1669
01:48:10,140 --> 01:48:14,970
It took about a year that,
because I slept with my car, 15.

1670
01:48:15,600 --> 01:48:19,410
And then when I was in training group,
I always had all the weapons around me.

1671
01:48:19,411 --> 01:48:23,080
I felt safe, but it,
you know, 4th of July.

1672
01:48:23,130 --> 01:48:27,270
It was always a hard one with stuff
going on, you don't know. And it,

1673
01:48:27,330 --> 01:48:29,310
it took me a while to do,

1674
01:48:29,460 --> 01:48:34,460
to calm down and not because I had a
lot of kills and you just have to work

1675
01:48:36,571 --> 01:48:38,010
through all that all the time.

1676
01:48:38,070 --> 01:48:42,120
And I was pretty good
cause not after that,

1677
01:48:43,110 --> 01:48:46,620
uh, period of time, you know,
we'd never talked to each other.

1678
01:48:46,830 --> 01:48:50,730
We weren't allowed to talk about
it for 20 years is what I was told.

1679
01:48:51,150 --> 01:48:53,580
So I never ever talked to anybody.

1680
01:48:53,581 --> 01:48:56,610
I never met anybody until 2000

1681
01:48:57,020 --> 01:49:00,440
did you guys, I mean when you, when
you, you guys didn't keep in touch,

1682
01:49:00,470 --> 01:49:04,490
you guys didn't write each other or
figuring out each other and I wrote each

1683
01:49:04,491 --> 01:49:06,650
other, but he, his family moved.

1684
01:49:06,651 --> 01:49:11,651
I only had his mother and father's
address and I lost contact for 25 years.

1685
01:49:12,440 --> 01:49:16,220
I moved, he moved, my
parents moved and uh,

1686
01:49:16,310 --> 01:49:21,080
so the Camo dropped but we were
down. There was no books. No,

1687
01:49:21,600 --> 01:49:25,520
no one, nobody could say anything. What
about other team members? Other guys?

1688
01:49:25,521 --> 01:49:28,670
Was there anyone that you kept in
touch with over the next 20 years? No.

1689
01:49:28,700 --> 01:49:33,320
So when you were done, you were done.
I was done. Didn't do it. It was over.

1690
01:49:33,730 --> 01:49:34,850
Cause I couldn't find anything, anybody

1691
01:49:34,850 --> 01:49:36,200
I didn't know anybody to talk to.

1692
01:49:36,980 --> 01:49:40,430
So I was just done and
I just let my life just,

1693
01:49:40,580 --> 01:49:43,090
I never thought about
it anymore. You know, I,

1694
01:49:43,140 --> 01:49:45,710
I knew I did stuff but I
couldn't talk about it.

1695
01:49:47,020 --> 01:49:51,130
And I had gotten married and
I told my wife about it, but,

1696
01:49:52,090 --> 01:49:54,910
uh, we just thought that we
didn't know where anybody ran.

1697
01:49:54,911 --> 01:49:56,230
I didn't know where anybody went to.

1698
01:49:56,860 --> 01:50:01,860
And then all of a sudden the internet
came about and I typed in SF one time and

1699
01:50:02,410 --> 01:50:04,420
a couple of emails came up,

1700
01:50:04,930 --> 01:50:09,120
old ones I typed in and McCluskey got,

1701
01:50:09,250 --> 01:50:11,020
he was working as an, uh,

1702
01:50:11,700 --> 01:50:14,410
a medivac pilot and uh,

1703
01:50:14,680 --> 01:50:18,130
he called me and you see he was on shift
and he saw it and he called me and he

1704
01:50:18,131 --> 01:50:20,260
gave me tilts phone
number and I called tilt.

1705
01:50:20,261 --> 01:50:24,880
The next day was Easter
Sunday 2000. Yeah. Yeah.

1706
01:50:25,180 --> 01:50:26,440
We're going to get ready to go to church.

1707
01:50:26,530 --> 01:50:30,670
I have, I hadn't seen
him since 1968 or 69.

1708
01:50:31,420 --> 01:50:32,740
And where were you living at the time?

1709
01:50:33,010 --> 01:50:37,780
I lived up by you semi national park
in the town called Mariposa. Beautiful.

1710
01:50:38,050 --> 01:50:41,710
And you were just down in Oceanside?
Yeah, working at the paper,

1711
01:50:42,010 --> 01:50:46,540
the fish wrapper. So I said,

1712
01:50:46,541 --> 01:50:48,780
well shoot, you know, uh, I,

1713
01:50:49,220 --> 01:50:52,990
I got the phone number and I
called him on Easter Sunday.

1714
01:50:52,991 --> 01:50:57,790
He was going out the door to go to
church and I said, you better sit down.

1715
01:50:57,820 --> 01:50:58,660
This is the Frenchman

1716
01:51:03,140 --> 01:51:06,520
that we've been, we talk
every day now cause we can,

1717
01:51:06,840 --> 01:51:09,270
what did you, uh, what'd
you do for a job? So you,

1718
01:51:09,390 --> 01:51:12,900
you had to kind of continue to
kind of get it out of your system,

1719
01:51:13,320 --> 01:51:17,400
were breaking horses or whatever Rodeo
for another year after you went out

1720
01:51:17,610 --> 01:51:19,740
breaking more bones. Uh,

1721
01:51:20,160 --> 01:51:23,010
and then you went into construction
business in the construction business

1722
01:51:23,700 --> 01:51:28,700
that my father had gone into a private
construction for a particular person and

1723
01:51:30,170 --> 01:51:32,550
uh, so at left the uh, license open.

1724
01:51:32,551 --> 01:51:37,551
So I just continued the license and he
handed it over to me and I built for

1725
01:51:39,571 --> 01:51:42,840
almost 45 years. I'm retired now.

1726
01:51:43,870 --> 01:51:48,090
What, where did you guys overlap? What
was the, did you guys overlap in RTI?

1727
01:51:48,091 --> 01:51:49,930
Idaho. Is that when you guys overlap?

1728
01:51:50,110 --> 01:51:53,980
Well, we are at food. When he came
in, he came with a Bubba. Okay.

1729
01:51:54,100 --> 01:51:58,810
And so McGovern got him first before
I were talk to him and I got bubba.

1730
01:51:59,170 --> 01:52:02,560
So we're in camp, we're training
together at the firing range.

1731
01:52:03,340 --> 01:52:07,870
Then Bob and I were doing our targets
that they're doing theirs. And um,

1732
01:52:08,320 --> 01:52:10,120
then when we moved, he was,

1733
01:52:10,170 --> 01:52:14,890
he closed out fob one is the last SF
troop there. His recon team closed it,

1734
01:52:14,891 --> 01:52:15,730
locked the gate.

1735
01:52:16,150 --> 01:52:20,050
By that time Lynn and I were
down in a Denang already,

1736
01:52:20,620 --> 01:52:22,510
so we're running missions.
He went down with,

1737
01:52:22,630 --> 01:52:25,480
with the RT Virginia with Gunther Walt.

1738
01:52:26,080 --> 01:52:30,880
And so they went down random mission,
including the famous oil drum one.

1739
01:52:31,600 --> 01:52:36,600
And Lynn and I were doing our thing and
then by April my time and country was

1740
01:52:37,150 --> 01:52:40,750
getting close. So Lynn had agreed
to be the come to one zero.

1741
01:52:41,200 --> 01:52:44,140
We had a special missing, we're
supposed to go up to [inaudible] pass.

1742
01:52:44,590 --> 01:52:49,590
We brought Doug in a Max fort and Barry
and an officer to go with us on that

1743
01:52:51,141 --> 01:52:54,650
mission. We trained for the
mission train right up to it.

1744
01:52:54,860 --> 01:52:56,690
Went to the launch site on the choppers,

1745
01:52:56,691 --> 01:53:00,920
took off and they called us
back and because two aircraft
was shot down over the

1746
01:53:00,921 --> 01:53:02,330
target area that day.

1747
01:53:03,260 --> 01:53:06,800
And so I was about four or
five days from de Roasting.

1748
01:53:07,480 --> 01:53:10,550
We then we went back to camp,
they put up the Marble Mountain.

1749
01:53:11,540 --> 01:53:16,280
So we're up there, we have some pictures
from that time there. And then, um,

1750
01:53:16,460 --> 01:53:19,250
I walked off of Marco Mountain,
went back up my gear and went home.

1751
01:53:19,790 --> 01:53:24,440
So Doug stayed with Idaho. Got It.
So from April at the end of April,

1752
01:53:24,441 --> 01:53:26,390
all the way through October 69,

1753
01:53:27,020 --> 01:53:32,020
he's with Idaho with willin and they
ran a load of missions and I come back,

1754
01:53:32,450 --> 01:53:37,070
he just left base crowded, but Lynn's
there, southern Lynn was the one zero.

1755
01:53:37,280 --> 01:53:40,830
So he and I took turns and in
find that sergeant major goes,

1756
01:53:40,940 --> 01:53:43,010
is too much experience here,
black, you're outta here.

1757
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:48,590
And then I went back to being a one
zero for another five months and that by

1758
01:53:48,591 --> 01:53:51,410
that time he had come home,
but he's in training group.

1759
01:53:51,980 --> 01:53:55,820
So technically he got out of the
army after I did, I got out in April.

1760
01:53:55,821 --> 01:53:59,290
And you got out in June. July,
September 1st December 1st. Yeah.

1761
01:53:59,930 --> 01:54:01,880
And so, uh, I went, my,

1762
01:54:01,940 --> 01:54:06,770
I went back to the garden state and then
he went back to California and separate

1763
01:54:06,771 --> 01:54:09,440
ways. And we did, we had
the cards in some notes.

1764
01:54:10,180 --> 01:54:13,730
I don't think many phone calls and it
just let us back if we had a couple guys.

1765
01:54:13,731 --> 01:54:18,731
I had other people I stayed in contact
with and then I just figured he got a job

1766
01:54:19,011 --> 01:54:21,650
with a CIA or did something
somewhere else, you know,

1767
01:54:22,850 --> 01:54:26,120
and then finally got the phone call
in 2000 and the rest is history.

1768
01:54:27,130 --> 01:54:29,120
And how often do you guys link up now?

1769
01:54:29,710 --> 01:54:34,500
Every day it's on the phone. Like
it's like you and the Echo Charles,

1770
01:54:34,570 --> 01:54:35,403
you know,

1771
01:54:35,560 --> 01:54:39,590
and w we, we talk almost every
day and uh, because we can,

1772
01:54:41,030 --> 01:54:46,030
we're alive and we try now to spread
the story since we've been declassified.

1773
01:54:49,580 --> 01:54:53,480
Like you're helping tremendously
to spread this story,

1774
01:54:53,481 --> 01:54:55,430
to let people know that we actually,

1775
01:54:55,431 --> 01:54:59,540
there was a secret war going on and we
were actually taking the war to the enemy

1776
01:54:59,750 --> 01:55:04,730
because our country had signed a treaty
saying that we would not go into north

1777
01:55:04,731 --> 01:55:09,320
Vietnam, Laos and
Cambodia or the DMZ. They,

1778
01:55:09,321 --> 01:55:13,250
which we operated in every day.
Right. We weren't stationed here.

1779
01:55:13,251 --> 01:55:17,300
We just flew in by helicopters.
People always ask me, well,

1780
01:55:17,301 --> 01:55:19,430
how long did you fight
in South Vietnam? I said,

1781
01:55:19,431 --> 01:55:23,600
I never fought a day in south Vietnam.
They all, you need to do anything. No,

1782
01:55:25,490 --> 01:55:29,920
that's true. Yeah. Right.
It's, what was your reaction?

1783
01:55:30,020 --> 01:55:33,710
That stuff started to Kinda come to the
surface and people started talking about

1784
01:55:33,711 --> 01:55:37,250
it. Uh, it was a slow,

1785
01:55:37,540 --> 01:55:39,740
pretty been a slow process. Uh,

1786
01:55:40,160 --> 01:55:44,580
I've got to hold a tilt and then we saw
each other the very first time after all

1787
01:55:44,581 --> 01:55:48,240
those years, like he was standing on a
corner when I drove by and picked him up.

1788
01:55:48,740 --> 01:55:52,710
Yeah. And we went, yeah, we
went to an air show. And, uh,

1789
01:55:52,890 --> 01:55:55,400
we started talking, we had our, uh,

1790
01:55:55,830 --> 01:55:59,610
photo albums that we weren't supposed to
have cause no pictures was supposed to

1791
01:55:59,611 --> 01:56:01,980
be taken. Look at all the
pictures that are out there.

1792
01:56:03,450 --> 01:56:05,970
Good recon men always do
whatever they want. Right.

1793
01:56:06,360 --> 01:56:10,530
So w w but it's been a slow, he says,

1794
01:56:10,531 --> 01:56:13,830
well we have a reunion now. I really,

1795
01:56:14,090 --> 01:56:18,540
we'd have it in Vegas every October
now. And uh, it's been going on what,

1796
01:56:18,541 --> 01:56:22,990
45 years? 43 44 years. 44 years worth. I,

1797
01:56:23,460 --> 01:56:27,870
I've been there about 18 years now.
Special Operations Association. Yup.

1798
01:56:28,170 --> 01:56:29,003
And, uh,

1799
01:56:29,310 --> 01:56:33,250
so we go there and see each
other and sit around and drink.

1800
01:56:33,270 --> 01:56:36,510
And of course I don't
drink, but you know, we,

1801
01:56:36,780 --> 01:56:38,880
everybody drinks and it's a free bar and,

1802
01:56:39,270 --> 01:56:44,270
and tell old war stories to each other
and just a couple of lies and stories get

1803
01:56:44,281 --> 01:56:47,410
more exaggerated. And,
but we, we have, uh, we,

1804
01:56:47,420 --> 01:56:51,780
we have the opposite problem
is we're dying faster than,

1805
01:56:51,900 --> 01:56:56,850
than you can. We're, we were
losing about 10 or 12 tops, six,

1806
01:56:56,851 --> 01:56:58,500
seven in the very beginning.

1807
01:56:58,501 --> 01:57:02,760
Now we're losing over 50 a year and there
weren't that many of us to start with,

1808
01:57:02,761 --> 01:57:06,000
but this is a combined
all the support troops,

1809
01:57:06,840 --> 01:57:07,950
actual recon troops,

1810
01:57:07,951 --> 01:57:12,810
there's probably not but 45 or 50 there
at all at all because we only had what,

1811
01:57:12,811 --> 01:57:16,500
450 [inaudible] passenger
you talk to, you know.

1812
01:57:17,250 --> 01:57:19,170
And so, uh,

1813
01:57:19,770 --> 01:57:24,330
we have this great reunion every year
and I just never miss it because I don't

1814
01:57:24,331 --> 01:57:27,150
know who's going to
die, but it's like, uh,

1815
01:57:27,390 --> 01:57:32,390
yesterday was our interpreter hepps two
year anniversary of his death and most

1816
01:57:34,261 --> 01:57:38,460
everybody's going down with Agent
Orange of some kind of cancer and stuff.

1817
01:57:39,410 --> 01:57:43,380
Uh, LDN Bardwell just went
down from an accident. Uh,

1818
01:57:44,250 --> 01:57:48,450
he was our two star general, very
proud of him, but at the time he was,

1819
01:57:48,780 --> 01:57:49,613
we were both shocked

1820
01:57:50,350 --> 01:57:53,980
in Germany was where I didn't, I, my,
my boss would work directly for him,

1821
01:57:53,981 --> 01:57:57,400
so I was, I was under his command, but
my, my boss at the time just, you know,

1822
01:57:57,490 --> 01:58:01,090
just absolutely loved them and,
and you know, tried to tell me,

1823
01:58:01,510 --> 01:58:03,940
try to give me quotes when he'd come
back from a meeting with bars. Well,

1824
01:58:03,941 --> 01:58:07,320
he said, Barb old Dan said this,
no old man said that, you know, he,

1825
01:58:07,720 --> 01:58:08,700
he was just a [inaudible] my

1826
01:58:08,700 --> 01:58:13,470
house not too long before that.
And, and uh, in my train room, I,

1827
01:58:13,590 --> 01:58:16,650
I've got trains Lionel and, uh,

1828
01:58:17,550 --> 01:58:19,890
he was there and had a great time.

1829
01:58:19,920 --> 01:58:23,310
They were roommates for a few months
and we went on R and r together.

1830
01:58:23,460 --> 01:58:27,810
I've met his first son, uh, when
he was two months old. Yeah.

1831
01:58:28,360 --> 01:58:31,300
And you know, remember story with
Elvin getting shot in the chest. Yeah.

1832
01:58:31,770 --> 01:58:32,760
So two days later,

1833
01:58:33,600 --> 01:58:38,600
Elden and Doug went to Hawaiian
with their respective wives for R.

1834
01:58:39,130 --> 01:58:42,070
And. R. They're there for
five days in Elden met

1835
01:58:42,070 --> 01:58:46,360
his son for the first time. His eldest
son Brandt Brandt grant was here.

1836
01:58:46,750 --> 01:58:50,600
So you guys must have watched him
cause he was, you know, uh, uh,

1837
01:58:51,030 --> 01:58:55,120
a general in the army and he was in the
limelight for sure for a military guy.

1838
01:58:55,690 --> 01:58:58,720
And you guys knew the whole time
you're looking at him thinking, Hey,

1839
01:58:59,230 --> 01:59:01,180
we'll just call him
specialist fourth class.

1840
01:59:02,100 --> 01:59:04,450
Cause that's the way we knew I
could never call him general.

1841
01:59:04,451 --> 01:59:08,520
I could never call him barge you.
I called him Elden, you know,

1842
01:59:08,530 --> 01:59:13,530
spent four Elvin and he was the same
Elden that we met in 68 is the same outlet

1843
01:59:16,410 --> 01:59:18,040
with went to reunion with his last year.

1844
01:59:18,400 --> 01:59:20,860
He was there and as we
spend a glory and uh,

1845
01:59:21,930 --> 01:59:23,860
know that's the way we respect him.

1846
01:59:24,070 --> 01:59:29,070
Like when my son got a wounded and in
Iraq he went and saw this care at the

1847
01:59:29,771 --> 01:59:31,840
hospital, picked up for him right away.

1848
01:59:32,020 --> 01:59:36,420
They couldn't believe at two star general
walk in for some little girl. Yeah,

1849
01:59:36,490 --> 01:59:41,260
some of those best. He's a scout and he
got banged up with a Humvee. Really bad.

1850
01:59:41,261 --> 01:59:45,250
But the Elton was, what year
was at, uh, August 20th,

1851
01:59:45,250 --> 01:59:48,550
2005 a couple of weeks later.
You were in country then?

1852
01:59:49,140 --> 01:59:53,340
I W I didn't while I was in there. Oh,
three Oh four. And you know six. Where,

1853
01:59:53,350 --> 01:59:56,080
do you know where it was in Iraq? Yeah,
he was southeast of the Green Zone.

1854
01:59:56,140 --> 02:00:00,550
Okay. Yeah. Small world.

1855
02:00:00,580 --> 02:00:01,413
What's he doing now?

1856
02:00:02,040 --> 02:00:06,700
He's up at doing heavy equipment training
up in a long beach. Him and Bruno,

1857
02:00:06,910 --> 02:00:11,370
his faithful companion or they're doing
it and just kicking ass. Take a number.

1858
02:00:11,371 --> 02:00:14,830
So pretty soon have all the licenses
in place and if you need any, uh,

1859
02:00:15,160 --> 02:00:17,260
heavy equipment work,
give him a call right on.

1860
02:00:19,960 --> 02:00:23,510
And a freshman will build a house
for you. Adrian, what about, so you

1861
02:00:23,520 --> 02:00:27,630
got, you got, you got married when you
got done. Is that or along the way?

1862
02:00:27,690 --> 02:00:29,910
Along the way? Yeah. And
did you have any kids?

1863
02:00:30,360 --> 02:00:35,160
I have a son and I have a daughter. I've
got a grandson and two granddaughters.

1864
02:00:35,880 --> 02:00:38,940
Very proud of them. I'm
really proud of my son. He,

1865
02:00:39,300 --> 02:00:42,540
he has his own company in the
oil business doing really well.

1866
02:00:42,960 --> 02:00:47,140
He would pairs all the big
fracking machines. Yeah. Um,

1867
02:00:47,400 --> 02:00:51,210
I'm right now, I'm in Texas. I was
in Tennessee when I'm in Texas now.

1868
02:00:51,450 --> 02:00:54,420
Now that I've found out
what my medical health is,

1869
02:00:54,421 --> 02:00:57,730
I want to try to get my grandson to, uh,

1870
02:00:58,320 --> 02:01:02,220
know me before I go. Well,
that's, that's awesome.

1871
02:01:02,221 --> 02:01:07,170
He's going to be as proud as he can
be. As proud of you as you are of him.

1872
02:01:07,171 --> 02:01:09,960
That's for damn sure. Well, they
made an action figure of me,

1873
02:01:09,961 --> 02:01:12,300
so I've left that action figure for him.

1874
02:01:14,010 --> 02:01:18,870
And that's the famous picture. Yes.
The famous SOG. Uh, the Frenchmen.

1875
02:01:19,140 --> 02:01:23,640
Yes. I've seen it. There's a good review
of it on, on uh, youtube I watched.

1876
02:01:23,700 --> 02:01:24,250
Yeah. The,

1877
02:01:24,250 --> 02:01:29,250
you can go to youtube and
look up Frenchmen action
figure and it's done really

1878
02:01:30,031 --> 02:01:34,590
well by Ryan Peters. Yeah. He
did a really excellent job.

1879
02:01:34,770 --> 02:01:37,800
Even made the box and everything
for it. Yeah, no, it looks,

1880
02:01:39,950 --> 02:01:43,820
it's pretty awesome. Well, I'll
definitely, I'll definitely post the data.

1881
02:01:43,910 --> 02:01:48,830
That picture when, when this goes
up, when this goes out onto the, uh,

1882
02:01:49,330 --> 02:01:52,280
on the interwebs, as they say. And
you've got your freshman challenge coin.

1883
02:01:52,400 --> 02:01:54,980
I got my freshman challenge
coin. Yeah. It's right here.

1884
02:01:55,730 --> 02:01:59,330
The lowest ranking challenge coming
out there makes the general's MBA.

1885
02:02:02,330 --> 02:02:03,410
It's a PFC challenge.

1886
02:02:05,250 --> 02:02:09,470
It doesn't get much better
than that. Yeah, for sure.

1887
02:02:11,080 --> 02:02:12,650
Uh, you got anything else?

1888
02:02:12,920 --> 02:02:16,280
I think this is a good place to be and
if you listen to this and you think of

1889
02:02:16,281 --> 02:02:19,220
more things you want to say, but
you know, I think this is a good,

1890
02:02:19,490 --> 02:02:21,050
good spot to wrap up this one.

1891
02:02:21,680 --> 02:02:26,660
So if you've got anything until you got
anything else first. No, the stories.

1892
02:02:27,320 --> 02:02:30,590
Um, you know, it's funny
because even we were in base,

1893
02:02:30,920 --> 02:02:35,480
we never knew a lot of the details
and so when I put the books together,

1894
02:02:36,220 --> 02:02:38,810
talked to other people,
like the oil drums story,

1895
02:02:38,811 --> 02:02:42,530
we learned about 40 years later that
Lynn black had done a similar thing with

1896
02:02:42,531 --> 02:02:46,340
RTI, Idaho after I left
right in between these guys.

1897
02:02:46,580 --> 02:02:51,580
And it's just like a lot of
histories that comes out slowly.

1898
02:02:52,100 --> 02:02:52,910
Like Doug said,

1899
02:02:52,910 --> 02:02:57,800
was anyone tracking? Was anyone writing
down the history as it was happening?

1900
02:02:57,830 --> 02:03:01,760
Was anyone taking the operational
summaries and compiling them somewhere?

1901
02:03:01,940 --> 02:03:03,410
They were all destroyed.

1902
02:03:03,770 --> 02:03:08,770
That was when I left Fubu by one of my
jobs was to go through and make sure that

1903
02:03:09,591 --> 02:03:12,860
all the drums had been note the ashes.

1904
02:03:13,220 --> 02:03:18,220
They had burnt all the reports after
action reports were all burnt and then as

1905
02:03:19,971 --> 02:03:24,971
we pulled out of every fob and
closed down CCN and CCS and CCC,

1906
02:03:26,630 --> 02:03:29,060
we closed them all down.
Everything was destroyed.

1907
02:03:29,061 --> 02:03:32,360
There's very few after
action reports with their rs,

1908
02:03:32,361 --> 02:03:36,530
just minuscule reports. People
try to put them out on Ebay,

1909
02:03:36,531 --> 02:03:38,990
but their fake, there just isn't any

1910
02:03:39,570 --> 02:03:41,450
think there are out there. We, we haven't.

1911
02:03:42,340 --> 02:03:45,770
There are reports of archives that
were even now began to look into,

1912
02:03:45,950 --> 02:03:49,880
but at a recent reunion, a guy
came up to me and said, hey,

1913
02:03:50,510 --> 02:03:52,760
you know, if you'd done your books, I got,

1914
02:03:52,761 --> 02:03:57,761
I like to talk to you because my job
when we closed cartoon was to destroy all

1915
02:03:58,161 --> 02:04:02,600
the records. Yeah, yeah. Lot of valor.

1916
02:04:03,170 --> 02:04:06,700
Yeah, we, that's why the upset,

1917
02:04:06,740 --> 02:04:11,360
I didn't even receive my purple heart
for that first mission until 11, 11, 11.

1918
02:04:12,510 --> 02:04:17,510
Rio had to go back to the paperwork on
it and we had to find years and a lot of

1919
02:04:18,201 --> 02:04:20,770
people and, and, uh,

1920
02:04:21,080 --> 02:04:24,050
a lot of affidavits and a lot
of this and a lot of that.

1921
02:04:24,470 --> 02:04:28,730
And it took six years.
And until Diane Black,

1922
02:04:28,731 --> 02:04:32,390
my congresswoman, uh, called me one day.

1923
02:04:32,480 --> 02:04:34,400
I was coming back from Arlington,

1924
02:04:34,460 --> 02:04:37,920
from burying Gunther Wall and,

1925
02:04:38,340 --> 02:04:41,780
and my Virginia team,
Donnie shoe, and, and, um,

1926
02:04:42,720 --> 02:04:47,610
Bill Brown, William Brown. And
uh, she calls me on the phone.

1927
02:04:47,620 --> 02:04:52,260
I don't even know who she is. She says,
are you Douglas Eternal, the Frenchman?

1928
02:04:53,820 --> 02:04:57,510
I said, uh, yes. And she says,

1929
02:04:57,960 --> 02:05:02,250
I'm Diane Black Congressman for Tennessee,

1930
02:05:02,720 --> 02:05:04,530
for your district, for your district.

1931
02:05:04,980 --> 02:05:08,850
And I'm in my limousine right now and
I'm holding a purple heart in my hand.

1932
02:05:09,210 --> 02:05:12,000
How do you want it presented? I said,

1933
02:05:12,001 --> 02:05:16,620
I want you to pin it on front
of our memorial in Gallatin,

1934
02:05:16,621 --> 02:05:20,820
Tennessee. And, uh, she did on 11, 11, 11.

1935
02:05:22,550 --> 02:05:24,390
And my guys came and watched.

1936
02:05:25,320 --> 02:05:30,320
I had seven of my saugers come
to that and watched tilt came.

1937
02:05:30,421 --> 02:05:34,680
Everybody flew in, we were there,
they were there for witness.

1938
02:05:36,750 --> 02:05:38,100
And even though we found one to medics,

1939
02:05:38,200 --> 02:05:42,450
they had pulled that this string out
from this trapping as an eye witness.

1940
02:05:42,480 --> 02:05:43,740
That's, that was a key thing.

1941
02:05:43,741 --> 02:05:47,550
We got the CEO to do a letter but took
a while to track it down and put it

1942
02:05:47,551 --> 02:05:48,510
together. But we did

1943
02:05:49,940 --> 02:05:53,510
cause all the records had
been destroyed, you know, so.

1944
02:05:54,020 --> 02:05:56,240
Well this record won't
be destroyed right here.

1945
02:05:56,630 --> 02:06:00,140
I promise you that podcast
one eight six one eight six.

1946
02:06:01,580 --> 02:06:05,330
There you go. But I would like
to say as a closing thing,

1947
02:06:06,200 --> 02:06:09,560
my mom and dad are both
gone. My Dad was a hero.

1948
02:06:10,820 --> 02:06:13,970
He gave me everything he had to
give. He was the best father ever.

1949
02:06:13,971 --> 02:06:17,780
My mother was the best
mother. I'm proud of my kids,

1950
02:06:18,020 --> 02:06:20,990
my daughter and my son. What
they've accomplished in their lives.

1951
02:06:21,020 --> 02:06:24,810
I'm proud of my grandkids
and what they do. And uh,

1952
02:06:24,950 --> 02:06:27,410
I'm glad that I have
something to leave behind.

1953
02:06:28,080 --> 02:06:31,210
And his mom when she, when
she'd learned my mother died,

1954
02:06:31,810 --> 02:06:36,440
I got a phone call next day till
your mom's dead bottom of your mom.

1955
02:06:38,680 --> 02:06:42,010
Yep. My mom loved every one of them. Bubba

1956
02:06:44,230 --> 02:06:47,680
came to La and said,

1957
02:06:47,681 --> 02:06:52,000
I need a bunk up for a couple
days. Six and a half months later.

1958
02:06:54,590 --> 02:06:59,050
And He'd gone through the LAPD
and six and a half months later,

1959
02:06:59,470 --> 02:07:02,040
he even got married and brought
his wife into the house.

1960
02:07:03,160 --> 02:07:06,070
My Mom and dad finally
said, enough's enough

1961
02:07:07,930 --> 02:07:10,180
for your wedding present.
We're giving you an apartment

1962
02:07:13,570 --> 02:07:17,650
date. But any Sauger was welcomed
in my mom and dad's house.

1963
02:07:18,310 --> 02:07:20,020
Oh yeah. Well, uh,

1964
02:07:20,520 --> 02:07:23,520
that is awesome. And as
you both should know,

1965
02:07:23,521 --> 02:07:28,410
any soccer is welcome to come here at
any time and, and share their story.

1966
02:07:28,770 --> 02:07:31,200
There's this door to,
this podcast is open. Uh,

1967
02:07:31,380 --> 02:07:34,890
this could just become the sod podcast
as far as I'm concerned at this point.

1968
02:07:35,330 --> 02:07:36,070
So work on

1969
02:07:36,070 --> 02:07:39,550
it. We thank you. Yeah. Appreciate
it too. Thanks for coming back. Yeah.

1970
02:07:39,551 --> 02:07:44,380
You've opened up a lot of doors to
people that will hear this history.

1971
02:07:45,130 --> 02:07:48,360
Absolutely. And they'd
there. I'm sure there are.

1972
02:07:48,380 --> 02:07:50,410
I'm sure you're hearing from
until, I know that you've been,

1973
02:07:50,411 --> 02:07:53,200
you've been transferring some of
the messages to me. What's your,

1974
02:07:53,290 --> 02:07:56,830
what's the Twitter that you're
actually looking at right now?

1975
02:07:57,040 --> 02:07:57,880
Cause you have a couple,

1976
02:07:58,330 --> 02:08:02,570
oh, you have John Soggy of SOG chronicles.

1977
02:08:03,250 --> 02:08:04,250
Do you know which one it is?

1978
02:08:04,820 --> 02:08:08,420
Oh my daughter said there's one is j
Stryker Meyer initial Jane and strike of

1979
02:08:08,620 --> 02:08:11,510
mine. I haven't, I've fallen
out of the Twitter thing.

1980
02:08:11,710 --> 02:08:14,900
You've admonished me that
season. So Instagram, Instagram,

1981
02:08:14,930 --> 02:08:18,290
Instagram is what you're doing a little
bit. Your social media over here.

1982
02:08:19,170 --> 02:08:22,850
I'm trying to catch up to you.
I might be slow but I'm slow.

1983
02:08:23,570 --> 02:08:27,410
Who been so busy the last few
weeks, um, between work and yes.

1984
02:08:27,411 --> 02:08:30,710
Responding to a lot of the
feedback from folks, uh,

1985
02:08:30,711 --> 02:08:32,540
off of the up last podcast.

1986
02:08:33,790 --> 02:08:37,540
People want to reach out to you. Should
they go through through John Frenchman?

1987
02:08:37,670 --> 02:08:41,600
Yeah, they can go, they'd go great
out through with John Or, uh,

1988
02:08:41,601 --> 02:08:45,980
they could catch me on train
one 53. The word train one,

1989
02:08:46,610 --> 02:08:50,210
the numbers53@hotmail.com.
That's my email.

1990
02:08:50,520 --> 02:08:55,520
It says email and then my website is saw
chronicles.com and my emails here and

1991
02:08:56,771 --> 02:09:00,910
I'll connect anybody with Doug as the
old fashioned way in Instagram's where

1992
02:09:01,010 --> 02:09:04,710
we're still working on that. But my
daughter's got to give me another piece.

1993
02:09:04,720 --> 02:09:08,680
She went to Tennessee, so she's
out of town. I'm struggling,

1994
02:09:08,681 --> 02:09:12,520
but maybe give me a briefing when we
hang up here. I close out tonight.

1995
02:09:12,920 --> 02:09:17,510
That all good. Eh, it's such an
honor to talk to you guys. Frenchmen.

1996
02:09:17,540 --> 02:09:20,380
It's an honor to meet you and
a, you're welcome back. Anytime.

1997
02:09:20,510 --> 02:09:22,690
I'm glad that I could come and meet you.

1998
02:09:22,691 --> 02:09:25,630
And I told you what
happened on the airplane.

1999
02:09:25,750 --> 02:09:29,070
I'm sitting next to somebody and
he goes, what are you doing on?

2000
02:09:29,120 --> 02:09:32,650
I'm going to go do a podcast
with a guy named Jocko Jocko.

2001
02:09:33,280 --> 02:09:37,570
Oh my God. I got him on my feet,
whips out his phone and there you are.

2002
02:09:37,571 --> 02:09:41,440
And he says, I got Twitter with him.
I got everything when he's my buddy.

2003
02:09:42,880 --> 02:09:44,140
Oh, I mean,

2004
02:09:45,040 --> 02:09:49,210
why would I even expect that somebody
would have such a small world?

2005
02:09:49,240 --> 02:09:50,073
It really is.

2006
02:09:50,330 --> 02:09:54,020
Well, regardless of our service,
we're all part at 1% or less of a,

2007
02:09:54,021 --> 02:09:58,220
of our country. [inaudible] that
served a country. Yeah. And in combat,

2008
02:09:58,360 --> 02:09:59,860
and I'll tell you the, the, uh,

2009
02:09:59,920 --> 02:10:02,410
amount of feedback I've gotten
from when you came on till, I mean,

2010
02:10:02,411 --> 02:10:06,460
it's been overwhelming the number
of people that just, you know,

2011
02:10:06,461 --> 02:10:07,540
thank you for your service.

2012
02:10:07,720 --> 02:10:10,690
They're going to pass the same
thing on to you and you know, um,

2013
02:10:10,930 --> 02:10:14,560
you guys should know that America loves
you guys for what you did for this

2014
02:10:14,561 --> 02:10:15,394
country.

2015
02:10:15,730 --> 02:10:20,200
Oh, thank you. Thank you. Too much. You
too. Airborne, airborne, all the way,

2016
02:10:20,470 --> 02:10:21,303
all the way.

2017
02:10:24,620 --> 02:10:26,210
And with that,

2018
02:10:28,280 --> 02:10:33,050
SOG has left the building.
The Frenchmen and tilt

2019
02:10:34,370 --> 02:10:37,850
have departed. Awesome. What an a,
what an honor and a half those guys on.

2020
02:10:37,880 --> 02:10:41,780
And I've got to say this
right after we got done,

2021
02:10:41,781 --> 02:10:46,781
of course were we did some more
talking and the Frenchman was,

2022
02:10:47,750 --> 02:10:52,750
was explaining the fact that when
he would go out on a mission,

2023
02:10:53,360 --> 02:10:54,860
every mission he would go out on,

2024
02:10:55,400 --> 02:10:58,820
he would square away his footlocker,

2025
02:10:59,360 --> 02:11:03,080
make sure everything was
ready to be shipped home
because every time he went out

2026
02:11:03,140 --> 02:11:05,450
he figured he would not be coming back.

2027
02:11:08,690 --> 02:11:09,523
[inaudible]

2028
02:11:12,300 --> 02:11:13,133
real heroes.

2029
02:11:15,030 --> 02:11:17,760
And it's awesome to be able to

2030
02:11:20,150 --> 02:11:21,890
sit here and talk to those guys and

2031
02:11:25,090 --> 02:11:29,980
what a, what an honor
that is. And anyways, um,

2032
02:11:32,710 --> 02:11:33,040
you know,

2033
02:11:33,040 --> 02:11:37,390
actually one of the reasons that I can
sit here and talk to guys like tilt and

2034
02:11:37,391 --> 02:11:42,391
the French men is because of all the
support that comes in from all of you.

2035
02:11:43,480 --> 02:11:44,313
So

2036
02:11:45,700 --> 02:11:50,650
appreciate you know that
because as you know,

2037
02:11:50,710 --> 02:11:53,290
I don't have any like regular

2038
02:11:55,010 --> 02:11:57,440
whatever they're called
advertisements on here,

2039
02:11:58,190 --> 02:12:03,190
cause I'm not going to interrupt someone
like tilt or someone like the French or

2040
02:12:04,250 --> 02:12:07,220
someone like BTF Tony or
someone like Dakota Meyer.

2041
02:12:07,221 --> 02:12:11,990
I'm not going to interrupt
them. So I can say, you know,

2042
02:12:12,050 --> 02:12:14,900
hey, buy this or buy that or whatever.

2043
02:12:17,380 --> 02:12:19,030
No, I'm not going to stop reading

2044
02:12:21,630 --> 02:12:26,630
colder than hell or I'm not going to
stop reading the forgotten Highlander.

2045
02:12:26,941 --> 02:12:31,470
I'm not gonna stop reading one
soldiers war so that I can,

2046
02:12:31,590 --> 02:12:36,390
you know, mention a product or
something like that. So to me,

2047
02:12:36,420 --> 02:12:39,300
that's not what this podcast is about.

2048
02:12:41,010 --> 02:12:44,160
The information and yeah,

2049
02:12:44,220 --> 02:12:49,220
the information in this podcast is what
is it paramount to me than getting it to

2050
02:12:49,411 --> 02:12:51,480
all of you uninterrupted

2051
02:12:53,170 --> 02:12:55,060
is what matters.

2052
02:12:56,850 --> 02:13:01,850
Because I will tell you that I wish that
I could have listened to this podcast

2053
02:13:01,921 --> 02:13:05,100
when I was growing up and were, even
when I was a kid when I was in the teams,

2054
02:13:05,840 --> 02:13:06,240
just to,

2055
02:13:06,240 --> 02:13:11,240
just to have this information would
have been really helpful to me.

2056
02:13:13,411 --> 02:13:17,610
So I'm not keeping it from anyone. So

2057
02:13:18,140 --> 02:13:18,973
okay,

2058
02:13:19,440 --> 02:13:22,260
that's what we're doing here
through if you do want to help out,

2059
02:13:22,290 --> 02:13:26,490
which like I said, that's, that's
what allows us to be able to do this.

2060
02:13:26,491 --> 02:13:30,170
That's what allows me to be able to fly
the French men out here to sit down and

2061
02:13:30,690 --> 02:13:32,100
and talk and tell his story.

2062
02:13:32,101 --> 02:13:36,510
And so it's because of you
all out there supporting,

2063
02:13:38,220 --> 02:13:42,930
supporting my companies or my books
or whatever. So it's appreciated.

2064
02:13:44,370 --> 02:13:46,380

That's called Jocko podcast and that's
where we have the videos of this.

2087
02:15:08,470 --> 02:15:11,890
If you want to see what the Frenchman

looks like, you can check
out the youtube channel.

2089
02:15:14,901 --> 02:15:19,010
There's also little shortened
excerpts of this podcast.

2090
02:15:19,730 --> 02:15:24,320
I've got a album called psychological
warfare that's on iTunes,

2091
02:15:24,321 --> 02:15:28,460
Google play, other MP3
platforms. It's me talking about

2092
02:15:30,710 --> 02:15:34,940
how to overcome little
interruptions in your game

2093
02:15:36,530 --> 02:15:40,580
that you're trying to win, so you can
check that and we also have a flip side,

2094
02:15:40,581 --> 02:15:45,581
canvas.com my brother Dakota Meyer has
that company and he's making visual

2095
02:15:47,130 --> 02:15:52,130
artwork for your walls
that you can hang up.

2096
02:15:52,520 --> 02:15:57,520
We also have on it on it.com/jock or
you can get all kinds of cool stuff on

2097
02:15:59,510 --> 02:16:03,140
there. Kettlebells, jump ropes,

2098
02:16:04,820 --> 02:16:07,310
sandbags, things that you
can get stronger with.

2099
02:16:07,910 --> 02:16:11,480
I've also written a bunch of
books. If you want to support,

2100
02:16:12,200 --> 02:16:16,700
you can get some of the books way. The
warrior kid is a series of books I wrote.

2101
02:16:17,650 --> 02:16:18,060
Okay.

2102
02:16:18,060 --> 02:16:21,000
There's three of them. The most
recent one is called wares,

2103
02:16:21,210 --> 02:16:25,790
where there is a will and that book is
available right now and so was warrior

2104
02:16:25,800 --> 02:16:28,350
way. The where your kid one
and weigh the warrior kid too,

2105
02:16:28,351 --> 02:16:31,850
which is subtitled Mark's
mission, Mikey and the dragons,

2106
02:16:31,930 --> 02:16:35,440
the book for younger kids that I wrote
so your kids can learn how to overcome

2107
02:16:35,441 --> 02:16:39,070
fear. The discipline equals
freedom field manual,

2108
02:16:40,210 --> 02:16:42,070
which is a manual about
how to get after it.

2109
02:16:42,690 --> 02:16:45,220
All the little questions
that you have are answered.

2110
02:16:46,180 --> 02:16:49,960
If you want the audio version of
that, it's on iTunes, Amazon music,

2111
02:16:49,990 --> 02:16:54,310
Google play, other MP3 platforms and
of course there's extreme ownership,

2112
02:16:54,311 --> 02:16:58,000
which is the first book I wrote with my
brother Leif Babin and then we have a

2113
02:16:58,001 --> 02:17:00,970
follow on book to that
called the dichotomy of
leadership and those books are

2114
02:17:00,971 --> 02:17:03,430
both about leadership
and how to lead people.

2115
02:17:03,700 --> 02:17:08,500
I have a leadership consultancy called
echelon front and what we do is solve

2116
02:17:08,501 --> 02:17:12,040
problems through leadership. If
you have problems in your company,

2117
02:17:12,490 --> 02:17:17,490
it is because you have problems with
your leadership to go to on front.com if

2118
02:17:17,531 --> 02:17:21,400
you want us to come and help you
solve those problems. ETF Online.

2119
02:17:21,401 --> 02:17:23,440
This is leadership training online.

2120
02:17:23,441 --> 02:17:28,441
It's interactive and I always say
that leadership is not an inoculation.

2121
02:17:28,781 --> 02:17:30,790
You can't get one shot of it
and then you know everything.

2122
02:17:30,791 --> 02:17:34,120
It's like going to one Jujitsu class and
thinking you know how to choke people

2123
02:17:34,121 --> 02:17:38,440
out now. No, you have to
train continually. That's
what ETF online is for.

2124
02:17:38,800 --> 02:17:43,800
Its online interactive training e
online.com we've got the muster events.

2125
02:17:45,810 --> 02:17:47,820
These are leadership conferences,

2126
02:17:48,960 --> 02:17:53,960
musters gatherings where we deep dive and
get granular on the pragmatic tools we

2127
02:17:57,361 --> 02:18:01,830
have for leading people. The next
one we're doing is in September,

2128
02:18:01,920 --> 02:18:04,320
September 19th and 20th it is in Denver.

2129
02:18:05,220 --> 02:18:09,690
It is going to sell out. In fact,
it's getting close I think right now.

2130
02:18:09,990 --> 02:18:11,250
Yeah. They've all sold out.

2131
02:18:11,280 --> 02:18:14,310
That one will sell out as well and

for doing everything that they did

2147
02:19:16,750 --> 02:19:21,750
to fight against the dark
tyranny of communism as it
tried to spread through the

world that they, they the line.

operations that they did.

2150
02:19:33,110 --> 02:19:38,110
And it's incredible the sacrifices
that those operators made in that time

2151
02:19:39,530 --> 02:19:44,270
especially. And obviously the
ones that did not come home.

2155
02:20:02,820 --> 02:20:03,300

Huh?

2165
02:20:42,130 --> 02:20:44,150
And to everyone else out there [inaudible]

2166
02:20:44,720 --> 02:20:45,553
don't know.

2167
02:20:46,520 --> 02:20:48,770
Remember what the Frenchmen,

2168
02:20:50,330 --> 02:20:54,020
remember what the Frenchman said after
his kernel God done explaining the

2169
02:20:54,021 --> 02:20:57,380
treacherous situation that
they were set to go into

2170
02:20:59,170 --> 02:21:03,490
when that colonel asked if anyone had
any questions, the freshmen replied,

2171
02:21:05,020 --> 02:21:06,250
where do you need help?

2172
02:21:10,040 --> 02:21:11,300
Where do you need help?

2173
02:21:14,300 --> 02:21:17,240
It's a simple question,
but it's a powerful one.

2174
02:21:17,420 --> 02:21:20,240
There's people around you that need help.

2175
02:21:24,140 --> 02:21:25,520
Ask them what it is they need.

2176
02:21:27,470 --> 02:21:32,470
Ask him where it is that they need help
and then get up and lock and load your

2177
02:21:33,261 --> 02:21:34,010
sod off.

2178
02:21:34,010 --> 02:21:39,010
M 79 or whatever tool it is that you need
to unleash to give them the help that

2179
02:21:39,861 --> 02:21:44,330
they need. And until next time,

2180
