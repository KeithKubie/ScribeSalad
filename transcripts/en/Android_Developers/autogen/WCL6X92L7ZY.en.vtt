the wallet fragment okay so now how you
 

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:21.300
the wallet fragment okay so now how you
use the wall effect it's basically three

00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:21.310
use the wall effect it's basically three
 

00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:23.010

00:17:39.290 --> 00:17:42.070
step it's actually to charge the user
and to do that you need to request a

00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:42.080
and to do that you need to request a
 

00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:44.290
and to do that you need to request a
payment credential from us and to do

00:17:44.290 --> 00:17:44.300
payment credential from us and to do
 

00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:47.500
payment credential from us and to do
that you call our last API called full

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:47.510
that you call our last API called full
 

00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:50.049
that you call our last API called full
wallet and to call that API you need

00:17:50.049 --> 00:17:50.059
wallet and to call that API you need
 

00:17:50.059 --> 00:17:52.480
wallet and to call that API you need
what we call the food water request the

00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:52.490
what we call the food water request the
 

00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:54.250
what we call the food water request the
full request is a nice little object

00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:54.260
full request is a nice little object
 

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:56.260
full request is a nice little object
here that receives only two parameters

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:56.270
here that receives only two parameters
 

00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:57.940
here that receives only two parameters
basically the first one is the google

00:17:57.940 --> 00:17:57.950
basically the first one is the google
 

00:17:57.950 --> 00:17:59.770
basically the first one is the google
transaction ID which is just an

00:17:59.770 --> 00:17:59.780
transaction ID which is just an
 

00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:01.419
transaction ID which is just an
identifier that is generated by the

00:18:01.419 --> 00:18:01.429
identifier that is generated by the
 

00:18:01.429 --> 00:18:03.370
identifier that is generated by the
previous call and you just need to

00:18:03.370 --> 00:18:03.380
previous call and you just need to
 

00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:05.440
previous call and you just need to
forward it to the second call to be able

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:05.450
forward it to the second call to be able
 

00:18:05.450 --> 00:18:07.419
forward it to the second call to be able
to complete it and the second one is the

00:18:07.419 --> 00:18:07.429
to complete it and the second one is the
 

00:18:07.429 --> 00:18:08.980
to complete it and the second one is the

on what the payment token actually looks

00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:40.400
on what the payment token actually looks
 

00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:43.810
on what the payment token actually looks
like so the payment token in the case

00:18:43.810 --> 00:18:43.820
like so the payment token in the case
 

00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:44.620

see it looks like a credit card but it's
 

00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:19.210
see it looks like a credit card but it's
not really a credit card it even passes

00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:19.220
not really a credit card it even passes
 

00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:20.400
