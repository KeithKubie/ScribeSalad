00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:04.400
SPEAKER 1: Welcome, everyone.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:09.240
We're extremely pleased today
to have with us Mingming Yang.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.730
Mingming received her PhD from
the MIT physics department

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.140
last September.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:21.160
She was part of a team
of various scientists

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:26.940
who were responsible for
their work on the Large Hadron

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.250
Collider for the discovery
of the Higgs boson.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.050
Mingming worked on searching
for the Higgs boson

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.370
through its photon decay
at the LHC in CERN, which

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.160
is the European Organization
for Nuclear Research.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.360
Since then, Mingming has been
traveling around the world,

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.360
sharing her story and meeting
with different people.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.880
We are so delighted to
have her with us today

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.700
to share her experiences and
take us through her journey.

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.558
Thank you.

00:00:58.558 --> 00:01:00.988
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.810
MINGMING YANG: Thank you very
much for the introduction.

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.310
Good afternoon, everyone.

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.860
This is a very colorful
stage, and my heart

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.440
is beating a little bit fast.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.560
I'm Mingming Yang.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.530
Last summer, I
submitted my PhD thesis

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.880
to the MIT physics department
about the discovery

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.100
of the Higgs boson, and the
measurements of its properties

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.030
through the two-photon decay.

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.370
And I have been
traveling since then.

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:38.950
I'm writing a story on the road.

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.830
This story is not just
about science, but also

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.720
about people behind this
scientific discovery.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.480
There's a huge beauty
in the human activities

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.670
that I experienced through
the search of the Higgs boson,

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:01.050
and I would like to deliver it
to more people in the world.

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.090
The name of the story
is "The Discovery,"

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.120
and I would like to tell
the story to you today.

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.290
So do not worry if you do not
understand all the details.

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.880
It's just like me
looking at a painting

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.090
or listening to
a piece of music.

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.660
I don't necessarily
understand all the details,

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.430
but I can still
feel it as a whole.

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.130
So please do not leave
before I finish the story.

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.220
And please feel it.

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.230
OK, are you ready?

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.340
Let me start from the night when
we first unblinded the Higgs

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:48.860
search result. The night
before June 15, 2012,

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.370
I started writing
down blinding slides.

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.720
My teammates, Fabian Stokely,
postdoctoral researcher

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.620
from Switzerland,
and Josh Bendavid,

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.290
senior graduate
student from Canada,

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:08.230
continued working
towards the final plots.

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.140
Meanwhile, our colleagues
on another team,

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.230
students and researchers
of several institutes

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.610
from different countries,
are working independently

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:21.800
towards the same goal.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.160
This was going to be a sleepless
night for the searchers,

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.040
the working group of
the CMS experiment

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.490
at the Large Hadron Collider
of European Organization

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:37.590
for Nuclear Research,
searching for the Higgs boson

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.120
through its decay
into two photons.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.850
About one quarter century
ago before this June

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:49.270
night, my life started in
19-- one of the Asian capitals

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:51.020
in China.

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.250
My name is Mingming.

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.740
In Chinese, Ming
equals to [INAUDIBLE],

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:59.070
both associated with light.

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.010
Since the particle of
light is called photon,

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.390
if you want you can also
call me photon photon.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.940
I don't think my parents
gave me this name in order

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.910
to encourage me to search for
Higgs boson through its decay

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.900
into two photons,
because my parents have

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.550
no idea what is a Higgs boson.

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:20.974
But I do thank
them for giving me

00:04:20.974 --> 00:04:23.650
a happy childhood with
little constraint,

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.620
and letting me grow
freely into myself.

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.980
When I was 13 years
old, every weekday

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:34.440
I walked between my home
and my middle school,

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.540
40 minutes in the morning,
40 minutes in the afternoon.

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:42.450
On the road, I think about
various kinds of questions.

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:44.940
What score would I get
for the [INAUDIBLE] exam?

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:46.960
What to eat tonight?

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.940
I usually ran out of such daily
life questions about halfway,

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.140
and ended up
thinking about, what

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:56.260
is the fundamental
nature of the world?

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.460
Why do we do this?

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.530
I don't think I
reached any conclusions

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:06.220
on those profound questions
on that road at that time.

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.980
But I suspected thinking
about those questions

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:14.740
somehow transported me
to a particular space

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.227
at a particular time.

00:05:16.227 --> 00:05:19.260
To unblind the search
results of the Higgs

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.050
boson along with my colleagues.

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:24.990
And this result is
crucial to answer

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:29.210
one of the fundamental questions
of the particle physics--

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:32.050
what is origin of mass?

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:35.860
At this moment, the standard
model of particle physics

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.050
has survived all the
experimental tests

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:43.040
since its foundation
about a half century ago

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:46.450
The standard model is
a theory endeavoring

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:52.150
to describe all matter and
all forces in the universe

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:54.720
except for gravity.

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.800
[INAUDIBLE] are
fundamental particles.

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.590
How fundamental is fundamental?

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:03.870
Is an atom considered as
a fundamental particle?

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:08.490
The answer is no, because when
we look closely into an atom,

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:11.090
we see it is actually made
up of a particle called

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:15.400
proton, surrounded by another
particle called the electron.

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.160
And when we look
further into the proton,

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:22.410
we see it is made up of three
particles called quarks.

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:27.850
However, when we look as
closely as we can into the quark

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:31.680
and electron, we do not
see any subparticle inside,

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:34.430
and electrons and
quarks are considered

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:37.890
as fundamental particles.

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:42.495
According to the standard model,
all the fundamental particles

00:06:42.495 --> 00:06:48.190
are originally massless, like
photons, the particle carrying

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:52.490
electromagnetic force, also
known as a particle of light,

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:57.430
whose speed in space-time is
the maximum allowed speed,

00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:59.800
the speed of light.

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:04.180
However, a hypothetical
field permitting over space

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:09.350
and through time, and
this lightness of being,

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:13.900
and it interacts with
the fundamental particles

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:19.010
like water dragging down the
fish from the swimming of speed

00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:20.210
of light.

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:23.810
And it gives mass to the
fundamental particles,

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:28.000
which leads to the
formation of structures--

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.480
the stars, Earth, mountains,
and we human beings.

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:38.860
To prove the existence of
this field generating mass

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:43.520
that underlies other
existence, the observation

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:47.750
of the rip of the field, that
last undetected fundamental

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:53.700
particle, also called a
Higgs boson, was a key.

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:56.940
Generations of experimental
particle physicists

00:07:56.940 --> 00:08:01.640
have been searching
for the Higgs boson,

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:05.600
but no evidence is found.

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:10.920
The mass of the Higgs boson
is unknown except for a rough

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:12.990
larger bound, upper bound.

00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:17.880
And the possibility of low
Higgs mass is excluded.

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:21.990
Why the Higgs boson is so
difficult to be detected?

00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:24.415
First, it is very
difficult to be produced.

00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:29.560
The Higgs boson is
expected to be produced

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:32.230
from the collision between
a pair of particles,

00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:36.340
for example protons, where
the original particles are

00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:39.059
destroyed, and their
energies are converted

00:08:39.059 --> 00:08:42.070
to the mass of a Higgs boson.

00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:43.880
The Higgs boson
has a large mass.

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:48.180
That means it needs large
energy to be produced.

00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:51.090
And even if energy is
enough, the production rate

00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:53.550
of the Higgs boson
is extremely low,

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:56.770
about one out of
billions of collisions.

00:08:56.770 --> 00:08:59.495
Therefore a very
powerful collider

00:08:59.495 --> 00:09:03.790
is needed to provide
intense proton beams

00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:08.110
and bring them into
connections at a speed

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:10.900
almost the speed
of light in order

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:16.210
to create the Higgs boson in
a reasonable amount of time.

00:09:16.210 --> 00:09:20.570
Second, even if the
Higgs boson is produced,

00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:26.100
it decays immediately into
different types of particles,

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:28.320
and only these
decaying particles

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:32.300
can be detected given a
comprehensive detector

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:36.220
to identify different
types of particles

00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:40.030
and measure their energies
and moving directions.

00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:43.290
An enormous amount of
background collisions,

00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:45.730
which does not produce
the Higgs boson,

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:50.060
but the particles either
exactly the same or very similar

00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:51.820
to the Higgs decay.

00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:55.530
And the physicists have to
analyze the data collected

00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:58.805
from millions of
billions of collisions

00:09:58.805 --> 00:10:02.920
in order to illuminate
the statistical evidence

00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:05.120
of the Higgs boson.

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:09.850
Finally, the Large Hadron
Collider is constructed.

00:10:09.850 --> 00:10:14.090
The Large Hadron Collider
is a 27-kilometer ring

00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:19.230
underneath the area between
Geneva Lake and Jura Mountains,

00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:23.650
and it is designed to
collide two beams of protons

00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:31.190
at energies up to 14 TeV,
where one TeV equals 1,000 GeV,

00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:35.590
and 1 GeV is about
the mass of a proton.

00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:37.820
This collision
energy if seven times

00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:44.120
that of the previous-- highest
energy of the previous most

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:45.980
powerful collider.

00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:48.450
And the construction of
the Large Hadron Collider,

00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:53.560
along with its two largest
experiments, CMS and Atlas,

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:57.120
essentially are
proving or excluding

00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:00.870
the existence of
the Higgs boson.

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:05.080
Both experiments have a
giant cylindrical detector,

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:11.810
thousands of meters in
length and half that length

00:11:11.810 --> 00:11:13.640
in diameter.

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:18.670
And a collaboration of thousands
of physicists and engineers

00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:22.240
are all over the world.

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:27.330
Each experiment is to conduct
an independent Higgs search

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:30.750
through particle search
channels over a wide range

00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:33.000
of possible Higgs mass.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.660
And each search channel is
to search for the Higgs boson

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:40.380
through a particular
type of the Higgs decay,

00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:45.060
which is sensitive to a certain
range of the Higgs mass.

00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:49.260
In 2011, when the Large
Hadron Collider just

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:52.070
ramped up the rate of
proton-proton collisions

00:11:52.070 --> 00:11:55.930
at the energy of 7
TeV, I came to CERN

00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:59.560
to work on my PhD thesis,
searching for the Higgs boson

00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:01.610
through the two-proton channel.

00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:05.730
Well, after five main search
channels of the Higgs boson,

00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:10.800
along with my teammates from
MIT and other colleagues

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:14.150
within the Higgs to two-photon
working group of the CMS

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:17.040
experiment, by
analyzing the data

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:19.000
collected from
this sim detector.

00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:27.460
This plot shows you a collision
event producing two photons

00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:32.860
and caught by the detector
where the blue cylindrical area

00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:36.310
represents the detector, called
electromagnetic calorimeter

00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:38.720
made of tens of
thousands of crystals,

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:42.090
and the two red bars
represent the energy deposit

00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:43.465
of the photons
into the detector.

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:50.780
The two-photons channel looks
for two energetic photons

00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:53.310
from the Higgs decay.

00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:55.890
And it is one of the
most promising channels

00:12:55.890 --> 00:13:00.590
for the Higgs discovery when
the Higgs mas is relatively low,

00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:04.940
between 110 GeV and the 150 GeV.

00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:09.270
Thanks to the electromagnetic
calorimeter, photons

00:13:09.270 --> 00:13:11.510
can be clearly identified.

00:13:11.510 --> 00:13:13.400
Furthermore, their
energies could

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:16.910
be mirrored with excellent
resolution, from which

00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:20.530
a quantity called two-photon
mass can be reconstructed

00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:23.350
precisely for each photon pair.

00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:30.130
And this allows us constructing
a characteristic spectrum

00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:34.230
of the two-photon mass of
the identified photon pairs,

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:38.070
as shown on the right plot.

00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:42.700
In this spectrum, a signal peak
due to a Higgs boson centered

00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:45.970
on the Higgs mass, with
its width determined

00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:48.220
to by the two-photon
mass resolution,

00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:51.860
will sit on top of a
smoothly falling slope

00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:56.710
of the background, which
would give persuasive evidence

00:13:56.710 --> 00:14:01.000
if the Higgs boson exists.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:06.180
Despite the appealing
feature of the signal peak,

00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:10.500
the Higgs boson actually
does not quite frequently

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:13.630
decay to two photons.

00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:16.280
How rare is a two-photon decay?

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:20.860
It is about one out of hundreds
of the decay of already

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:22.990
rarely produced Higgs bosons.

00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:26.530
So the great challenge
facing this search channel

00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:31.380
is to identify this small
peak from the large background

00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:32.900
underneath.

00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:37.020
Facing this challenge, we
developed nice strategy

00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:40.290
to classify the photon pairs.

00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:43.250
The ones more likely
from the Higgs decay

00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:46.460
and have better
mass resolution are

00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:49.930
selected into a
higher-ranking class, which

00:14:49.930 --> 00:14:53.490
will have a sharper peak
in the mass spectrum

00:14:53.490 --> 00:14:58.330
and add more sensitivity
to the Higgs signal.

00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:03.280
Finally, we extract the signal
by comparing the observed

00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:08.690
spectra of all the classes
with models of expected signal

00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:11.860
plus background spectrum.

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:17.570
If any excess of the photon
pairs above the background

00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:23.250
expectation is observed, we
estimate the significance

00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:28.430
of the excess, as shown
on the right plot.

00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:30.820
The black curve
shows a probability

00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:34.230
that the observed excess
is due to the fluctuation

00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:36.910
of the background.

00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:40.560
If the lowest
probability is about one

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:46.190
out of 1,000, corresponding to a
significance about three sigma,

00:15:46.190 --> 00:15:49.650
we say there is evidence
of a new particle.

00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:54.960
And if the probability is
about dozens out of a million,

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:56.740
corresponding to
four sigma, we say

00:15:56.740 --> 00:15:59.190
there's convincing evidence.

00:15:59.190 --> 00:16:04.480
And if the probability reaches
1 out of 3 and 1/2 million,

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:08.930
corresponding to five sigma,
we claim the discovery

00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:10.940
of a new particle.

00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:16.700
OK, it takes a couple minutes
to say, however years to do.

00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:19.790
In order to reach the
final mass spectrum,

00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:23.280
we need to go through
many steps in analysis

00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:28.570
from the photon identification,
photon energy reconstruction,

00:16:28.570 --> 00:16:30.920
photon direction
of reconstruction,

00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:33.500
and the photon pair
classification.

00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:39.460
This plot gives you an example
of the observed mass spectrum

00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:41.980
from one of the classes.

00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:45.480
The black data points
show the observed number

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:48.580
of pairs of photons
as a function

00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:50.680
of the two-photon mass.

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:54.850
And the red curve is the
distribution of signal

00:16:54.850 --> 00:16:58.990
plus background fit
to the observed data.

00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:02.350
If the Higgs boson
exists, we would

00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:05.690
expect to see an
excess of photon pairs

00:17:05.690 --> 00:17:13.453
as shown like this data point
jumping from the background--

00:17:13.453 --> 00:17:14.619
smoothly falling background.

00:17:17.569 --> 00:17:20.760
By analyzing the 2011
data, we observed

00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:24.840
an excess of photon pairs above
the background expectation.

00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:30.830
Another channel in
the CMS experiment,

00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:33.790
the [INAUDIBLE] search channel,
also observed an excess,

00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:36.260
but not as significant.

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:39.260
And the combined excess
at the CMS experiment

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:44.070
is dominated by the excess
from the two-photon channel.

00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:46.530
A similar excess
is also observed

00:17:46.530 --> 00:17:49.650
at the Atlas
experiment, dominated

00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:53.260
by the excess of its
two-photon channel as well.

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:56.440
To determine the
source of this excess,

00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:58.680
whether it is from
the background

00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:04.510
fluctuation or a real signal,
the analysis of the 2012 data

00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:06.120
is critical.

00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:13.070
We improved our analysis, and
we optimized it to accommodate

00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:16.590
the enhanced energy to 8 TeV.

00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:21.940
And to avoid any possibility to
bias the results-- for example,

00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:25.140
artificially create a
peak in a spectrum--

00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:29.200
we do the analysis in a
strictly blind manner.

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:32.240
That means we do not
look at the signal

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:37.840
region in the mass spectrum
between 110 GeV to 150 GeV

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:40.810
until our analysis is
fully fixed and verified.

00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:46.420
And all the other Higgs
search channels also

00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:49.370
progressed under the blind.

00:18:49.370 --> 00:18:55.820
Finally, we reached this
night before June 15, 2012.

00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:59.720
In order to reach this night, we
had gone through many sleepless

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:03.280
nights working on analysis
through the development

00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:07.310
of different kinds of
components of the analysis,

00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:10.330
to multiple rounds
of producing results

00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:14.739
to keep updated with the
increased data and improved

00:19:14.739 --> 00:19:15.905
calibration of the detector.

00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:22.550
We had multiple teams in
the Higgs two-photon working

00:19:22.550 --> 00:19:28.070
group, each team running an
independent analysis framework.

00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:33.660
Those teams had also gone though
constructive, while sometimes

00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:37.230
fierce competitions on
the analysis methods,

00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:41.450
but ultimately strove together
for the final results.

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:47.550
To finalize the analysis
for the unblinding

00:19:47.550 --> 00:19:50.390
and to synchronize
among different teams

00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:54.510
equals to a huge effort
of the entire group.

00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:57.140
And finally, two
teams synchronized

00:19:57.140 --> 00:19:59.380
to a satisfactory level.

00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:03.390
Each team was going to produce
a set of unblinded results

00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:05.480
to cross check.

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:08.690
Among all the teams,
the MIT two-photon team

00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:12.740
is a small team known for
all coffee and no sleep.

00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:15.570
Our coffee machine
works so hard,

00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:17.370
and it was finally broken.

00:20:19.930 --> 00:20:22.480
As a result, our
proposed method was

00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:27.470
determined by the group as
the main analysis method.

00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:31.165
Besides the coffee machine,
working with me day and night

00:20:31.165 --> 00:20:33.550
are my teammates.

00:20:33.550 --> 00:20:37.240
So this guy with
the exploding hair

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:43.110
is Josh Bendavid, senior
graduate student from Canada.

00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:46.740
Josh effectively worked
24 hours every day.

00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:50.780
Whenever I needed discussion--
2:00 AM, 3:00 AM, 4:00 AM, 5:00

00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:56.570
AM, Josh is always there
online or on the phone,

00:20:56.570 --> 00:20:59.360
and our conversations
can write a book

00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:05.170
about 1,000 pages all about
the search for the Higgs boson.

00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:10.070
And this guy, he looks very shy.

00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:14.420
He is Fabian Stokely,
postdoctoral researcher

00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:15.960
from Switzerland.

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:21.710
And Fabian always wears
the same black tee shirt.

00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:29.600
And this guy is Christoph Paus,
my PhD supervisor from Germany.

00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:34.110
And he flies between MIT
and CERN every other week.

00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:36.320
You might think, where's me?

00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:39.740
So this is me in the window.

00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:44.170
And I have to admit
that I didn't have time

00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:50.160
to brush teeth for months,
and I no longer care.

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:53.250
There is dozens more
colleagues from MIT

00:21:53.250 --> 00:21:56.880
working on different Higgs
search channels, detector

00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:58.390
or computing.

00:21:58.390 --> 00:22:03.640
And they didn't care whether
I brushed teeth either.

00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:10.870
Well, you might want to ask, how
do you think about these days?

00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:14.400
There are [INAUDIBLE],
difficult to say.

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:17.840
I wish I had invited
you to my office

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:21.520
at CERN Building
32, fourth floor.

00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:25.220
There's not much room, and if
you come during the summer,

00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:27.330
there's no air conditioner.

00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:30.740
And my desk is so small,
it can hold nothing

00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:34.320
but a few books and a laptop.

00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:36.950
However, look
through the window.

00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:39.760
This is the view
that you can see.

00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:44.880
And listen to the music that
[INAUDIBLE] the corridor.

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:49.570
And what I want to say can be
summarized as the following.

00:22:49.570 --> 00:22:55.340
Late night, look deep into
the sky, turn on music loudly,

00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:57.630
loudly, and sing along.

00:22:57.630 --> 00:23:01.812
Good time to free the
soul and face the unknown.

00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:08.020
As the night was
progressing, Christoph

00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:11.480
was about to catch
another flight.

00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:15.730
Having fixed some problem
in our computer cluster

00:23:15.730 --> 00:23:21.450
at MIT, important for producing
the final analysis results,

00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:24.430
Christoph was flying to
CERN for the unblinding

00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:28.630
event in the coming
afternoon, the event

00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:32.630
that unblinded search
results from all the channels

00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:36.380
were presented to the
entire CMS collaboration

00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:37.970
for the first time.

00:23:37.970 --> 00:23:42.750
I wrote down my memory
about that night.

00:23:42.750 --> 00:23:47.910
And the unblinding went in the
coming afternoon into my story.

00:23:47.910 --> 00:23:53.500
And I'd like to share
a little bit with you.

00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:56.810
I stayed in a room
of the CERN hostel

00:23:56.810 --> 00:24:01.060
last night, within three
minutes walk from my office,

00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:05.670
40 minutes walk from my studio
in St. Saint-Genis-Pouilly,

00:24:05.670 --> 00:24:09.850
a small town at the foot
of the Jura Mountains.

00:24:09.850 --> 00:24:12.880
The past couple
weeks was so intense

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:19.350
that I almost live at CERN, with
few hours of sleep at the task,

00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:24.658
and 10 cups of coffee
many of the days.

00:24:24.658 --> 00:24:28.610
And since there was
almost no time to eat,

00:24:28.610 --> 00:24:32.370
there was no need
to brush teeth.

00:24:32.370 --> 00:24:36.990
Extremely tired, but
also extremely excited,

00:24:36.990 --> 00:24:41.740
I wrote down the slide-- title--
search for a standard model

00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:44.730
Higgs boson decaying to
two photons, unblinding.

00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:50.470
Representing the Higgs to
two-photon working group,

00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:54.660
I was going to unblind our
Higgs search results to the CMS

00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:58.750
collaboration in the coming
afternoon, the results still

00:24:58.750 --> 00:25:02.990
sitting in the dark
waiting to be uncovered.

00:25:02.990 --> 00:25:07.090
During the past year, I was
used to missing the last bus

00:25:07.090 --> 00:25:10.870
at 1:00 AM from CERN
to Saint-Genis-Pouilly

00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:15.310
and walking back along the
Jura Mountains onto the night.

00:25:15.310 --> 00:25:18.850
Sometimes the analysis
work got so busy

00:25:18.850 --> 00:25:22.320
that even such a walk
was not affordable.

00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:26.600
Instead, I would stay at a desk
in my office over the night,

00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:30.260
or move to the CERN hostel
during the critical times,

00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:34.250
like this night, expecting
a couple of hours rest

00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:39.240
on the bed to refresh, but
still remaining at the desk

00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:41.710
the entire night.

00:25:41.710 --> 00:25:44.190
The staff at the
CERN hostel was used

00:25:44.190 --> 00:25:47.480
to my unexpected
interruptions and being

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:49.530
able to find me a room.

00:25:49.530 --> 00:25:52.760
But no single room was
left for this night.

00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:55.300
All available was a double room.

00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:58.450
I paid for the room
without hesitation,

00:25:58.450 --> 00:26:00.420
not because I was rich.

00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:03.490
There was not much left of
a graduate student's center

00:26:03.490 --> 00:26:08.020
salary after paying the
rent, meal, and coffee.

00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:11.260
But the chance to work
together with these people,

00:26:11.260 --> 00:26:15.690
in this space, at this
time, towards these results,

00:26:15.690 --> 00:26:18.550
was only once.

00:26:18.550 --> 00:26:23.150
Even if I had to die
for the moment, I'd die.

00:26:23.150 --> 00:26:26.700
Everything else
is out of concern.

00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:31.190
The night deepened, floating
all the sleepless nights

00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:34.900
into the dark sky
towards the unknown.

00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:38.260
The slides grow within
the analysis descriptions

00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:41.690
and the validation plots,
reaching the black room

00:26:41.690 --> 00:26:43.590
for the final plots.

00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:47.610
The last round of cross checks
started between the two teams,

00:26:47.610 --> 00:26:52.140
with information flowing
through an email thread.

00:26:52.140 --> 00:26:56.070
Finally, the expected results
and the yields of photon pairs

00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:57.190
agreed.

00:26:57.190 --> 00:27:00.630
Time to look into
the signal region.

00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:04.830
Around 3:00 AM, both teams
unblinded the two-photon mass

00:27:04.830 --> 00:27:10.180
spectrum of the 2012
data-- clear excess jumping

00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:15.160
from the falling spectra of
multiple classes around 125

00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:19.650
GeV, about the same place
of the excess that we

00:27:19.650 --> 00:27:26.120
observed from the 2011 data.

00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:28.740
A real signal is there.

00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:32.770
It was not spoken
out, but I heard

00:27:32.770 --> 00:27:39.500
the yells bursting out from
the huts at different ends.

00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:46.110
Enormous excitement flowed out,
permeating silently in the air.

00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:49.040
I looked out through
the window into the sky

00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:52.770
with the speed of
light, but in the end,

00:27:52.770 --> 00:27:56.120
stood together with the
Grand Jura Mountains

00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:59.810
quietly upon the ground
watching the pairs

00:27:59.810 --> 00:28:03.295
of photons passing through
the light years of nights.

00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:09.780
Later in the morning,
we had a quick gathering

00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:11.820
together with more
colleagues from the Higgs

00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:16.150
to two-photon working group in
a small meeting room at CERN.

00:28:16.150 --> 00:28:18.820
Everybody looked
extremely excited,

00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:21.240
despite not sleeping much.

00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:23.610
We tried not to speak
loudly, since we

00:28:23.610 --> 00:28:26.000
had to keep the secret
until the unblinding

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.360
event in the afternoon.

00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:30.280
Still more plots to make.

00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:33.450
We soon went back to
work, with more colleagues

00:28:33.450 --> 00:28:36.880
from different teams
joining to help.

00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:41.130
At this time, all of the
huts were bumped together.

00:28:41.130 --> 00:28:46.600
I kept modifying the slides with
suggestions from my colleagues,

00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:51.730
while new plots continually come
of various statistical results

00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:57.450
or two-photon mass spectra being
updated with final granularity

00:28:57.450 --> 00:28:59.870
or refined style.

00:28:59.870 --> 00:29:02.870
As time approached
the unblinding event,

00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:05.780
I started putting the
final version of the plots

00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:08.320
from my colleagues
onto the page, one

00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:12.230
after another, each
plot a great trust

00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:15.780
falling silently upon my hut.

00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:17.690
Time passes 3:00 PM.

00:29:17.690 --> 00:29:21.690
I finally finished the
slides, with the last plot

00:29:21.690 --> 00:29:24.510
just assigned from Fabian.

00:29:24.510 --> 00:29:26.560
Our other colleagues,
after their super

00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:30.210
quick and collaborative
effort, had

00:29:30.210 --> 00:29:33.900
left earlier to the
unblinding event, which

00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:37.230
had already started at the
CERN building called Filtration

00:29:37.230 --> 00:29:38.770
Plant.

00:29:38.770 --> 00:29:44.230
Our channel was the second to
unblind, starting at 3:30 PM.

00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:47.520
We saved the slides
onto a flash disk

00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:51.650
and walked quickly towards
the conference room.

00:29:51.650 --> 00:29:53.780
So we arrived.

00:29:53.780 --> 00:29:56.690
Fabian opened the door.

00:29:56.690 --> 00:29:58.760
A hot current flowed out.

00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:02.650
The room was packed
with CMS colleagues.

00:30:02.650 --> 00:30:05.290
All the seats were taken.

00:30:05.290 --> 00:30:10.950
Many colleagues sat on the
floor or stood against the wall.

00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:14.480
There are probably also hundreds
of colleagues connecting

00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:17.570
through the video link.

00:30:17.570 --> 00:30:20.960
Good luck, said he,
one of the good lucks

00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:26.190
I have received from my
colleagues since the morning.

00:30:26.190 --> 00:30:29.630
I carried the slides
and moved slowly

00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:32.680
through the field
of my colleagues.

00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:37.010
My body got heavier and
heavier as the lives

00:30:37.010 --> 00:30:40.640
of more and more people
connected to my own.

00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:44.520
My teammates always gave
me the strongest support,

00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:48.000
my Higgs to two photons
colleagues striving together

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:52.620
on the unblinding night,
and the entire group

00:30:52.620 --> 00:30:56.680
having worked extremely hard
together since last year.

00:30:56.680 --> 00:31:00.180
Representing them, I was going
to unblind our Higgs search

00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:02.170
results.

00:31:02.170 --> 00:31:05.370
The CMS colleagues, having
worked on different stages

00:31:05.370 --> 00:31:10.010
and aspects of the experiment
during the past 20 years,

00:31:10.010 --> 00:31:13.380
leading to the final data
analysis for the Higgs search

00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:18.620
from design, construction,
commission, to operation,

00:31:18.620 --> 00:31:23.580
from hardware, software, to
computing, from data taking,

00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:27.740
calibration, reconstruction,
to validation.

00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:30.410
The colleagues working on
the different Higgs search

00:31:30.410 --> 00:31:33.830
channels trying to
answer the same question,

00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:36.860
and the colleagues working on
the different physics topics,

00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:39.730
from the precision measurements
within the standard model

00:31:39.730 --> 00:31:42.130
to the search beyond
the standard model,

00:31:42.130 --> 00:31:45.420
all trying to deepen and
enlarge the same drawing

00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:47.700
of fundamental particle physics.

00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:52.110
Many of them were in this room
or on the video link waiting

00:31:52.110 --> 00:31:56.580
to see and to listen
to the results.

00:31:56.580 --> 00:31:59.300
The Atlas colleagues working
towards the same goal,

00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:02.950
the Large Hadron
Collider's providing

00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:08.410
the most powerful and
intense proton beans,

00:32:08.410 --> 00:32:10.660
the generations of
experimental particle

00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:13.730
physicists search
for the Higgs boson,

00:32:13.730 --> 00:32:15.970
the theoretical
physicists whose work

00:32:15.970 --> 00:32:18.630
led to the prediction
of this particle

00:32:18.630 --> 00:32:23.440
about half a century ago,
and all the physicists

00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:26.610
from the experimental
and the theoretical sides

00:32:26.610 --> 00:32:29.520
working together to reach
the current understanding

00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:32.830
of the fundamental components
of matter and force

00:32:32.830 --> 00:32:37.960
over the past 100 years,
and all the human beings

00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:41.970
craving to understand
nature and ourselves,

00:32:41.970 --> 00:32:47.810
asking and searching across
the vast space and time.

00:32:47.810 --> 00:32:54.050
Some of us got together in
this space at this time.

00:32:54.050 --> 00:32:57.110
The Higgs to two photon
presentation was starting.

00:32:57.110 --> 00:32:59.610
My heart was beating violently.

00:32:59.610 --> 00:33:02.100
My mind was calm.

00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:07.500
Please, everybody, get ready
for the next 15 minutes.

00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:12.900
These 15 minutes would become
a part of our common memories.

00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:18.380
Please let me quickly show you a
couple of minutes from these 15

00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:19.410
minutes.

00:33:19.410 --> 00:33:23.815
Since there's no sound, so I'll
just to show you very quickly.

00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:28.134
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:33:39.586 --> 00:33:40.086
-[INAUDIBLE]

00:33:43.074 --> 00:33:48.552
So please everybody, get
ready for the next 15 minutes.

00:33:48.552 --> 00:33:51.042
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:51.042 --> 00:33:55.026
Hope it's exciting
and enjoyable.

00:33:55.026 --> 00:33:56.570
OK, not very exciting.

00:33:56.570 --> 00:34:02.020
This is the limit for the 2011.

00:34:02.020 --> 00:34:05.150
But the next one is
the limit for the 2012.

00:34:05.150 --> 00:34:07.126
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:07.126 --> 00:34:09.102
-Everybody quiet now.

00:34:09.102 --> 00:34:11.572
-Everybody quiet, OK.

00:34:11.572 --> 00:34:14.536
OK, this is the true unblinding.

00:34:14.536 --> 00:34:21.452
One, two, three,
[INAUDIBLE] OK, so this

00:34:21.452 --> 00:34:29.070
is what we see in the
2012 [INAUDIBLE] analysis.

00:34:29.070 --> 00:34:31.440
I don't list a number here.

00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:35.598
You can see this by eye.

00:34:35.598 --> 00:34:42.150
And this is the combined limit
for the 2011 and the 2012.

00:34:42.150 --> 00:34:46.450
And I'm going to show you the
p-value in the next slides.

00:34:46.450 --> 00:34:50.777
OK, so this is the
significance of the 2012.

00:34:50.777 --> 00:34:55.070
The black is the
combined significance.

00:34:55.070 --> 00:34:58.568
The red is for the type
[INAUDIBLE] category.

00:34:58.568 --> 00:35:02.879
And the rest, which are very
difficult to see by eye,

00:35:02.879 --> 00:35:04.658
is for different categories.

00:35:08.482 --> 00:35:13.060
And the [INAUDIBLE]
is on the next slide,

00:35:13.060 --> 00:35:18.430
which is the combined result
of the 2011 and the 2012.

00:35:18.430 --> 00:35:26.070
OK, so this is the
p-value of 2011 and 2012.

00:35:26.070 --> 00:35:30.290
This black one, this
is the combined.

00:35:30.290 --> 00:35:33.422
You can see it's beyond
[INAUDIBLE], one, two, three,

00:35:33.422 --> 00:35:34.724
and four.

00:35:34.724 --> 00:35:36.632
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:40.448 --> 00:35:43.927
The [INAUDIBLE] is for
[INAUDIBLE], and the magenta--

00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:48.890
MINGMING YANG: The
unblinded two-photon results

00:35:48.890 --> 00:35:52.600
giving the first convincing
evidence of the existence

00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:55.600
of a new particle.

00:35:55.600 --> 00:36:00.060
Night of that day, CERN
building two, fourth floor.

00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:06.190
We just experienced a historic
moment, said Christoph.

00:36:06.190 --> 00:36:07.950
Yes, we did.

00:36:07.950 --> 00:36:11.340
Not just in the
history of science.

00:36:11.340 --> 00:36:14.580
I did not speak out.

00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:19.240
What else do I still
remember during that day?

00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:23.150
This smiles from the
bottom of everyone's heart.

00:36:23.150 --> 00:36:25.760
Our final results
continue showing

00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:30.770
an excess around 125
GeV, which, combined

00:36:30.770 --> 00:36:35.900
with all the other
Higgs channels,

00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:42.500
gave the significance of
excess reach five sigma,

00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:46.590
the conventional criteria
to claim the discovery

00:36:46.590 --> 00:36:48.300
of a new particle.

00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:51.520
In the same time,
a similar excess

00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:55.510
was also observed from
the Atlas experiment.

00:36:55.510 --> 00:36:59.720
On July 4, 2012,
both experiments

00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:03.450
announced the discovery
of a new particle at CERN

00:37:03.450 --> 00:37:07.230
in a joint seminar with
the 36th International

00:37:07.230 --> 00:37:10.070
Conference of
High-Energy Physics, held

00:37:10.070 --> 00:37:11.495
at Melbourne, Australia.

00:37:14.330 --> 00:37:19.120
And you can see our
final plots showing

00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:25.170
both the signal and the
significance of the excess.

00:37:25.170 --> 00:37:27.710
And you can also
see the pictures

00:37:27.710 --> 00:37:30.810
at the bottom showing the
situation in the auditorium

00:37:30.810 --> 00:37:32.150
at CERN on that day.

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:38.580
Fabian was taking a night
shift, and he didn't make it

00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:44.020
to the auditorium, and we
didn't stop working on that day.

00:37:44.020 --> 00:37:49.520
And we did not have too
much time to celebrate, just

00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:53.790
except for taking a
couple of beers together.

00:37:53.790 --> 00:37:58.770
The world started swirling
while we kept working.

00:37:58.770 --> 00:38:03.220
The center of a storm
was always quiet.

00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:08.070
We didn't get any award,
but we have already

00:38:08.070 --> 00:38:12.410
get the best award
from nature itself.

00:38:12.410 --> 00:38:15.572
After discovery, we
continued to verify

00:38:15.572 --> 00:38:17.030
the observation of
the new particle

00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:19.980
and measure its properties
and check its compatibility

00:38:19.980 --> 00:38:22.100
with the Higgs boson.

00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:28.560
On June 15, 2015, I
submitted my PhD thesis,

00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:31.240
which concluded the journey
that I had experienced

00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:35.180
with my teammates and colleagues
with the stand-alone discovery

00:38:35.180 --> 00:38:38.950
of the Higgs boson through
the two-photon channel.

00:38:38.950 --> 00:38:41.670
And I have been
traveling since then,

00:38:41.670 --> 00:38:45.910
and writing this
story, "The Discovery."

00:38:45.910 --> 00:38:52.700
I want to share you the
end part of this story.

00:38:52.700 --> 00:38:57.370
This is the end of my story of
searching for the Higgs boson.

00:38:57.370 --> 00:39:02.322
During my travel from my
hometown to edge of Alaska,

00:39:02.322 --> 00:39:04.790
I have encountered
different people on

00:39:04.790 --> 00:39:09.090
the road-- high school
student, bookshop staff,

00:39:09.090 --> 00:39:13.310
elementary school teacher,
businessman, piano technician,

00:39:13.310 --> 00:39:17.910
taxi driver, probation officer,
raspberry farmer, plumber,

00:39:17.910 --> 00:39:23.100
mechanic, air flight controller,
coffee shop worker, lawyer,

00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:28.060
writer, art gallery host,
firefighter, painter, drummer,

00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:32.451
aerial silk dancer, gold
miner, single-handed sailor,

00:39:32.451 --> 00:39:34.610
fisherman.

00:39:34.610 --> 00:39:38.450
It is my pleasure to share with
them the Higgs search story

00:39:38.450 --> 00:39:42.630
and listen to their stories
back, and find how similar

00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:46.760
the story of fisherman searching
for the salmon at Bering Sea

00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:52.524
to our story of search for the
Higgs boson among the data sea.

00:39:52.524 --> 00:39:57.070
The hardship, the
friendship, the passion,

00:39:57.070 --> 00:39:59.640
and the feeling of
the power and beauty

00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:03.750
of nature-- after
all, human activities

00:40:03.750 --> 00:40:06.750
share the same common ground.

00:40:06.750 --> 00:40:10.290
And I'm glad to receive
a small toy occasionally,

00:40:10.290 --> 00:40:15.700
in a red Alaska crab
from 9-year-old Jenna.

00:40:15.700 --> 00:40:18.980
Sometimes I'm asked,
what is the significance

00:40:18.980 --> 00:40:23.490
of searching for the Higgs
boson to me and to human beings?

00:40:23.490 --> 00:40:27.330
I have been thinking about
these questions myself

00:40:27.330 --> 00:40:31.380
when walking on the road between
CERN and Saint-Genis-Pouilly,

00:40:31.380 --> 00:40:36.330
when writing my thesis, and
when s sitting on the train.

00:40:36.330 --> 00:40:40.210
I still remember a
conversation with Christoph

00:40:40.210 --> 00:40:45.180
at CERN, building 32,
fourth floor, in 2011.

00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:50.170
I told him that no matter
whether we make a discovery

00:40:50.170 --> 00:40:54.980
or not, and whether I
would get a PhD or not,

00:40:54.980 --> 00:40:58.550
I would never regret
coming and working here.

00:40:58.550 --> 00:41:00.980
This is my choice of life.

00:41:00.980 --> 00:41:04.040
And I want to say the same now.

00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:07.150
It is thrilling to have
been deeply involved

00:41:07.150 --> 00:41:11.290
with the milestone of the
discovery of the Higgs boson.

00:41:11.290 --> 00:41:15.180
But having worked
together with these people

00:41:15.180 --> 00:41:19.080
in that space at that time
itself is thrilling no

00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:21.520
matter the outcome.

00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:25.900
To me, connecting to the
generations of physicists,

00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:30.160
pursuing a common goal,
witnessing and devoting myself

00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:34.420
for the monumental effort of
human beings, along with all

00:41:34.420 --> 00:41:37.790
the colleagues,
discovering and interacting

00:41:37.790 --> 00:41:40.670
with all the beautiful
minds and hearts,

00:41:40.670 --> 00:41:45.690
continuously discovering myself
and feeling the deep harmony

00:41:45.690 --> 00:41:48.520
with nature, are the
most precious parts

00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:52.000
of the journey searching
for the Higgs boson.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:56.260
All my work is not for a PhD,
and even not for the Higgs

00:41:56.260 --> 00:42:00.290
discovery, but for life itself.

00:42:00.290 --> 00:42:02.940
And it has already been
finished long before,

00:42:02.940 --> 00:42:06.500
and has been contained
in all the moments.

00:42:06.500 --> 00:42:08.755
My main motivation
to write a thesis

00:42:08.755 --> 00:42:13.680
is to use the opportunity
to tell these people I have

00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:17.370
worked with that I love them.

00:42:17.370 --> 00:42:20.770
The analysis for the Higgs
search could be repeated,

00:42:20.770 --> 00:42:24.180
but those moments and the
stories of these people

00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:26.270
are not replaceable.

00:42:26.270 --> 00:42:29.100
Many of the stories
are very lovely.

00:42:29.100 --> 00:42:32.360
They probably will
never be stated.

00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:37.020
But they have been detected
and started in my heart,

00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:41.640
and probably only the people who
have experienced and witnessed

00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:47.220
these stories would feel
the deepest resonance.

00:42:47.220 --> 00:42:49.960
The [INAUDIBLE] journey
has been wonderful,

00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:52.350
especially because
I have shared it

00:42:52.350 --> 00:42:56.060
with some people who,
whenever I think of them,

00:42:56.060 --> 00:42:58.882
bring hot tears to my eyes.

00:42:58.882 --> 00:43:02.750
I would choose the same
way to spend my 20s again

00:43:02.750 --> 00:43:07.200
and again, If i were given the
infinite chance to step back,

00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:10.090
and infinite ways to choose.

00:43:10.090 --> 00:43:12.640
I will continue to
discover that future

00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:17.090
from all the uncertainties,
following the sky above me

00:43:17.090 --> 00:43:19.750
and the road within my heart.

00:43:19.750 --> 00:43:24.500
I hope this road will lead
to the liberation of the soul

00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:27.970
and enrichment of the
spirit of a human being

00:43:27.970 --> 00:43:31.590
and of human beings, as what
this Higgs search journey

00:43:31.590 --> 00:43:35.160
should ultimately lead to.

00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:41.080
The train keeps moving into
vast space at the front of time.

00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:43.800
What is the ultimate reality?

00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:46.230
Is the observed
particle the ripple

00:43:46.230 --> 00:43:48.710
of the field slowing
down the particles

00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:51.900
with mass such that
they could get together

00:43:51.900 --> 00:43:54.520
to form the structures
in the universe,

00:43:54.520 --> 00:43:58.260
including ourselves, as
described by the standard model

00:43:58.260 --> 00:44:00.480
of particle physics?

00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:04.050
Our understanding always
progresses with time,

00:44:04.050 --> 00:44:06.720
and the future will unblind.

00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:10.560
What is sure for the moment,
search for the Higgs boson

00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:14.890
does bring us together to
experience a series of events

00:44:14.890 --> 00:44:19.870
in that space and time,
becoming a monumental part

00:44:19.870 --> 00:44:23.730
of our-- a fundamental
part of existence

00:44:23.730 --> 00:44:27.460
and a monumental part
of human history.

00:44:27.460 --> 00:44:29.320
All the information
we have obtained

00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:31.780
from the proton-proton
collisions at the Large Hadron

00:44:31.780 --> 00:44:35.540
Collider, along with all
the efforts of generations

00:44:35.540 --> 00:44:39.150
of physicists and engineers
over the world, all

00:44:39.150 --> 00:44:43.770
the sleepless nights, all
the memorable moments, all

00:44:43.770 --> 00:44:47.780
the collisions among ourselves,
all the beautiful minds

00:44:47.780 --> 00:44:52.290
and hearts, all the
emotions and all the stories

00:44:52.290 --> 00:44:56.530
are folded into the results
sent towards the future,

00:44:56.530 --> 00:45:01.280
passing through layers of time
as pairs of photons passing

00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:04.480
through layers of
nights as what we have

00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:08.540
received from our predecessors.

00:45:08.540 --> 00:45:11.000
And all the
significance is already

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.890
contained in the
human activities that

00:45:13.890 --> 00:45:20.470
connect us with each other,
with nature, and with ourselves.

00:45:20.470 --> 00:45:24.980
At this moment, my
heart has already

00:45:24.980 --> 00:45:30.600
melted into infinite
pairs of protons

00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:37.110
colliding at infinite points
in that space and time,

00:45:37.110 --> 00:45:42.930
producing infinite pairs,
producing infinite number

00:45:42.930 --> 00:45:49.370
of Higgs bosons decaying to
infinite pairs of photons,

00:45:49.370 --> 00:45:53.190
pairing all my infinite
[INAUDIBLE] moments,

00:45:53.190 --> 00:45:57.010
flying towards the future.

00:45:57.010 --> 00:45:59.390
What is eternity?

00:45:59.390 --> 00:46:02.410
Every moment is eternity.

00:46:02.410 --> 00:46:07.130
This story is for you, and for
students and researchers who

00:46:07.130 --> 00:46:09.830
silently devote
all of themselves

00:46:09.830 --> 00:46:12.070
to the search for
the Higgs boson.

00:46:12.070 --> 00:46:14.810
Thank you for listening.

00:46:14.810 --> 00:46:20.945
[APPLAUSE]

00:46:20.945 --> 00:46:23.070
AUDIENCE: I was actually
at Atlas at the same time,

00:46:23.070 --> 00:46:26.180
so it brings back
a lot of memories.

00:46:26.180 --> 00:46:28.180
I was in the BSM Higgs group.

00:46:28.180 --> 00:46:30.870
So I just wondered
your opinion about,

00:46:30.870 --> 00:46:33.080
what was your feeling
towards the Higgs being

00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:34.800
more or less stand model like?

00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:37.135
Did you have any
thoughts about that?

00:46:37.135 --> 00:46:39.960
MINGMING YANG: The Higgs
boson is more standard model

00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:47.120
like is one good way that it
makes the standard model itself

00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:48.840
consistent.

00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:53.730
And that means
other understanding

00:46:53.730 --> 00:46:59.370
in that phase space of
matter and force is complete.

00:46:59.370 --> 00:47:02.000
But at the same time,
we know that there

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.080
are many other things
we do not know.

00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:08.410
And all we know about matter
and force actually is about 5%

00:47:08.410 --> 00:47:13.530
in the universe, and the other
25% is so-called dark matter.

00:47:13.530 --> 00:47:16.350
70% is called dark energy.

00:47:16.350 --> 00:47:20.330
At this point, we do not have
much knowledge about them.

00:47:20.330 --> 00:47:24.050
So I think this part
getting complete

00:47:24.050 --> 00:47:29.370
gives us a stepping stone which
sets the foundation for us

00:47:29.370 --> 00:47:31.850
to search towards the future.

00:47:31.850 --> 00:47:34.660
So one step at a time.

00:47:34.660 --> 00:47:37.420
AUDIENCE:So what's next
for you personally?

00:47:37.420 --> 00:47:40.290
MINGMING YANG: The future
is contained in now.

00:47:40.290 --> 00:47:43.360
So by asking what
is next for me,

00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:46.670
so let me say what
is now for me.

00:47:46.670 --> 00:47:50.120
I think for me personally,
I was extremely

00:47:50.120 --> 00:47:52.350
focused on the search
for the Higgs boson

00:47:52.350 --> 00:47:55.860
during the past
few years, and I'm

00:47:55.860 --> 00:47:58.850
a little bit like
defocusing for the moment,

00:47:58.850 --> 00:48:02.380
because searching for
the Higgs boson is

00:48:02.380 --> 00:48:05.480
kind of in one
direction in the phase

00:48:05.480 --> 00:48:07.560
space of human activities.

00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:12.130
But there are many, many,
many other directions,

00:48:12.130 --> 00:48:14.280
many, many other dimensions.

00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:18.760
And I hope to take this
opportunity to explore.

00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:23.100
One thing I feel is that for
me, I want to do two things.

00:48:23.100 --> 00:48:28.270
First is I see the huge
beauty in the human activities

00:48:28.270 --> 00:48:30.120
in the search for
the Higgs boson,

00:48:30.120 --> 00:48:34.370
and I would like to bring
that from that phase space

00:48:34.370 --> 00:48:37.640
to the larger phase
space of human beings,

00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:43.640
to bring the beauty into the
consciousness of human beings.

00:48:43.640 --> 00:48:45.350
But in the same
time, I would also

00:48:45.350 --> 00:48:48.950
like to explore and
observe and listen

00:48:48.950 --> 00:48:53.560
to the stories of other people
to see how can we work together

00:48:53.560 --> 00:48:56.690
towards a future,
and which direction

00:48:56.690 --> 00:49:00.420
that I can contribute the best
in the future to the humanity.

00:49:00.420 --> 00:49:01.970
[APPLAUSE]
