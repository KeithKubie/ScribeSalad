Speaker 1:          00:01          Three, two, one. Hey, I'm Jad [inaudible]. I'm Robert Krulwich, Radiolab and this, this like this. This is Alex bellows. Okay. He's a writer. He's written a lot about sports. Uh, particularly about Brazilian soccer but also math or he likes to say maths. And when I read my first math book, here's looking at Euclid, I went and gave loads of talks and at the end of the talk that all be someone who put their hands up and they'd say, what's your favorite number? And this used to just irritate me because I myself don't have a favorite number. You don't have a favorite number? No, I think it's stupid. I know that's actually incorrect. I did think it was stupid. I just didn't have one. Okay. And why would the question annoy him? [inaudible] to me it's the most normal question you could ask. Well, but this is, remember this is this is, he's talking about a math book to math enthusiasts.

Speaker 1:          00:48          What's your favorite numbers? Like sort of a, it's like, it's too silly or maybe it's like they're making fun of him. I got so free rated that once I think I was a bit tired. It was like, Hey, I don't know where the Gig was. And I just said, well it's your favorite number, just turning it back at the person in the audience. And they said, um Oh 12 I was shocked with it. But you, you weren't asking me because you were kind of taking the piss out of the math. No, you actually really wanted to know because you wanted to share your own favorite number. And he's like, oh yeah. And then the person sitting next to them were like, yeah, like mine's eight and then my mind seven. And I thought this is interesting and I can remember asking the audience as well who he has got a favorite number and at least half the people put their hands up. And in a way that you go from being a smoker when you stopped smoking to be like a rabbit. Anti-Smoker I went from being your favorite number, agnostic to being obsessed with favorite numbers. B started a website, favorite number. Dot Net. You know, just asking people to hit the question and I put it out there and I helped them out on my blog and I had within the first few weeks, I actually more than 30,000 people.

Speaker 2:          01:51          Hello? Hello. Hi. From all over the world. This is Jenny from round lake, New York. My name is Sitar from Dubai, [inaudible] Sydney, Australia, [inaudible] Bhaskar, Norway telling me their favorite numbers. My favorite number is definitely eight 30 29 11 and the reasons why, the reason it's four is because my favorite card is ace of spades and it's commonly called the death card. My birth date is four 1459 so by from nine is four. My favorite number is 100 because it is two zeroes. Okay, so here's what's fascinating about this, at least to me. First of all, the volume of response. He got about 30,000 submissions from all over the planet. We put out a call on our app, which are the voices you're listening to here. And we got 30,000 no, we got a gin. That's good. That's okay. I clearly people want to talk about their favorite numbers and about their reasons which are

Speaker 1:          02:50          from the heart. The numbers.

Speaker 2:          02:52          Five was always a friend cause it feels like home and family and it's kind of whole and balanced. People talked about it in emotional

Speaker 1:          03:00          terms, really warmness, coolness, standoffishness inviting this. It's this a hole in emotional landscapes in here under the numbers and nothing to do the numbers really, but it's just there. It was there from the very start. Okay. First of all, where do numbers go? Who invented them? Well, it depends what you mean by numbers. If by numbers mean this idea that we can tell the difference between two things and three things and we'll then we've had that ever since and if humans existed and you can test on animals and they do it too, but if you're talking about symbols and words, abstractions to designate specific numbers. This is probably only about 5,000 years old and was an invention of the Sumerians, which is basically Iraq and Alex is from the moment they came up with these samples, they then added sort of extra layers of utterly [inaudible] stuff.

Speaker 1:          03:51          Writes, like, let's take the Sumerian word for one. Um, and apologies for my accent and Sumerian fall. You, I am, I assuming it's been very rough, I guess, which has ges, I, I usually say get pass. Yes. Yeah. Or however you say it. That's the word for one. And that is also the word for Phallus. And the word for to is min mean, which is also the word for woman. And one can only really speculate, but there are, you know why. One is man and two as women, it could be, um, could be, they had some sort of Adam and eve notion in mind, like me first. You second or could be our distinguishing feature is that we have one of what makes us a man and that woman has two breasts, where to look, look, whatever they were thinking, they were not the only ones to be thinking along these lines.

Speaker 1:          04:46          You go forward 3000 years, 3000 years later, you get to [inaudible], right? The [inaudible] theorem guy yet. So Pythagoras repeated. The one is male, two is female thing. By saying that odd numbers or masculine and even numbers were feminine, even tried to justify by saying look like do the, do the calculations here because when you add even to odd, say three plus two, you get odd five, which means that when you add man to woman, you get man said man is kind of stronger, um, than, than, than women by that logic. Odd plus odd makes even so what does that two males make a female? I mean the whole thought is a little farfetched to me. So that is Steve Strogatz, professor of math at Cornell, irregular on our show, friend of radio lab. Peter of the Pythagorean way of thinking about numbers except for the triangle thing, which he loved. But, but here's what's weird, is it, you know, go 5,000 years after the Sumerians and right up to the present time when Alex does this worldwide survey though, what's your favorite number thing? Years. Something weirdly familiar. I will just read you for example, some of the adjectives and reasons why people prefer the number one strong, strong, independent pendant, honest, brave, brave, different tying earring, lonely, lonely cowboys. Knows your cowboy words. Exactly.

Speaker 3:          06:16          A picture, the number one as a man in a really nicely tailored Italian suit. He's got dark hair.

Speaker 1:          06:25          I don't know why it's like Marcella Mastriani rather than John Wayne too.

Speaker 1:          06:31          Cautious wise, pretty soft, nurturing, cold, fragile, very personal. Unintimidating open, a friendly, relational, sympathetic, complimentary, quiet, easy to understand. Flexible. It makes more sense. The kind of feminist kind of feminine, well, stereotypically feminine and we use our both men and women contributing these descriptors for these two numbers. Yeah. Yeah. That was really striking to me and it made me think, do you know what? We could all laugh at Pythagoras and the Sumerians and all the kind of ancient people saying, well one is male and two is female bits. Some fragments of that remain this way. This is not like a scientific study well serve actually. The more that you look, there's kind of some science behind it. In fact, there's a guy and this study in Indiana, a place, you know a yes. This guy, James Wilkie, assistant professor of the university, you know, or damn.

Speaker 1:          07:30          So James and his team, here's what they do. They take a baby that's just been born. Yeah, a few weeks old. Impossible to say. Just with the face, whether it's [inaudible]. So you had to get a 50 50 they show people pictures of these androgynous, a little bay region buried over in the side where you would hardly notice them. All heart strings of four or five digit numbers. Numbers happen to be either all even or all odd. Right? And James Guy say, don't worry about those. They there, they're there for the storage. These are tracking numbers. Go ahead and adore these. Just focus on the babies and the pictures and tell us male, female, just look at the face and tell us whether it's a male or a female. And it turns out that if a baby is next to our digits, you're more likely to say that it's a by that f the baby is next to even digits really well with me.

Speaker 1:          08:17          How much more likely by a lot or by a teeny bit. By statistically significant amount, not a landslide. Do you yourself assign any gender to either one? Do you find odd? A little more male in some, no, not at all. No. I've never felt that at all. I've known that they were a bit different because they sort of feel different. So he decided to investigate just to see if there's anything behind it. Yeah. Why not? Which led him and us to a guy named Greg Roland. Okay. Okay. This is Robert. Hi Robert. How are you? This is Andy. I'm a producer working with Robert m d so first of all, can you just tell us like w e you have a peculiar job,

Speaker 2:          08:56          I guess at least peculiar to me. Like what do you do? Well, I have founded a company called the semiotic alliance, which is a business, right? It is a consultancy. Yeah. So Greg is paid very good money, but some of the biggest brands in the world, Coca Cola for IBM to give them advice about how their brands would go down. We look at people's emotional responses to culture, symbols and ideas. On the basis of this, we can help companies with packaging, advertising. And often he says what that means is he's helping companies harness the symbolic power of numbers. I think one of the most exciting, um, encounters with mathematics for me was with KFC with the 11 Herb's a spices

Speaker 3:          09:39          who, who

Speaker 2:          09:43          [inaudible] 11 witches capitalistic in its, in its secrecy. Such a strange number. Well, I thought that Colonel Sanders was in his experimental kitchen and just and just happened to Sanders. You southern Oh Sanders fan. Colonel Sanders was in his kitchen and he was just fiddling around and he came up with 11 herbs. We call the herbs here and spices. That's one version of the truth. But the symbolic truth is far more interesting and potent 11 has enormous mystical potential simply because it's not 10 or 12 or five. It's not a sensible number. What's wrong with 10 if I say with my 10 herbs and spices, because with tenure implying that you have a decimal balance. So work is going to be very hard to engage people emotionally with with 10 10 Phil's ordered feels highly rational. Greg says it may have something to do with the fact that you have only 10 fingers are looking at them.

Speaker 2:          10:43          Dan as seven 11 just is that extra one that has made Colonel Saunders on copyable and the same thing might be happening with five oh one jeans like you know, why is it five oh one jad and not 505 oh one again has just gone one beyond the place you would expect to get to wait a second. What if you don't want that? What if you want a product where you need to play it safe? Well then you can stick with multiples of 10 which is really useful when you're trying to be practical or sorry, tip it absolutely. For example, I'm being attacked.

Speaker 2:          11:18          We're winning the war against sin. Take the act, be cream, oxy 10 which viewing your face, I know you're not entirely unfamiliar with it. 10 there is obviously, you know that's where we get to a solution. That's where are the fingers on our hands run out. So there is a sense of completion there. The sense of we've gone through the process and we're going to come out. Okay. Um, and of course that's why 11 is interesting. Just your, your embarking into the infinite. Um, at that point you're going to be on the human finger count. Ah, interesting.

Speaker 3:          11:54          [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          11:55          11 herbs and spices. That's right. How did the you say that as if you want to taste the thing I do like I used to love getting that as a kid. I did the 11 did the 11 number 11 some tickle you in any way? Yes, definitely would not buy it with 10 herbs and spices. That sounds very solid and Stalinist. Really? No, I'm Yanking, I'm yanking. I'm yanking your wishbone. Oh really? I was kind of hoping, no, I don't mean it. No, come on.

Speaker 1:          12:28          I got to agree with Steve. Like the, the, the idea that 11 is mystical because it's one more than 10 mm. Although with 10 I think he has a point. It is boring. I agree. Here's just a fact. Big Companies With Large Checkbooks called Greg up all the time for it.

Speaker 2:          12:43          I think the thing about numbers is that because they are so rational, uh, so abstract for that very reason, they ask you us in some way. Bizarre. Huh? I think human beings have an absolute need to invest emotion, love, hate, fear to invest in non rational into things which seem almost obscenely rational.

Speaker 5:          13:03          Hmm.

Speaker 3:          13:06          My magic number is number eight. I turned age 18 on October the eighth

Speaker 6:          13:13          1988. Number four because I want a swimming race in a plane for

Speaker 1:          13:20          as a child. My favorite number is three because to me it recalls to mind the trinity. Now, however you feel about all this stuff, one thing that seems pretty interesting to us, I had to Alex's you'd expect if you were asking the world to give you a favorite number, that'd be a huge difference from one culture to the next. 13 is an unlucky number. You don't have a 13th floor in America in Korea that doesn't have a fourth floor because it's unlucky for over there. Yeah. Yeah. But here's something interesting. The entire plan, all the continents and everyone in all the continents came to a kind of consensus around one number. Yeah. So tell me Alec, what was the world's favorite number? I hope you got some good audio of a drum roll coming up. Movie [inaudible] myself seven it's seven. My favorite number is seven.

Speaker 1:          14:13          I like the number, say favorite number is number seven and we heard pretty much the same thing in second place was three and the third place was there. Yeah, but it was a big win for seven 30% I had a three I became really interested in seven because yes, we all lose the favorite number, but why is it the people's favorite number and when did that begin? And I have one. Oh Great. I love hearing reason. Holes in your head. Years two and two. One in one nozzles. Three and four. Five yeah. Six and seven. Yeah. Seven, seven holes in your head. There is no way that can be true. Well then then look up at the night sky and BMS at potassium so you don't have a, what do you see? The Sun, the moon and five planets. Seven you spend the whole night looking at seven.

Speaker 1:          14:55          Yeah, of course. That's not what you hear from people. Then number seven just looks beautiful. What you hear from people. It's about how beautiful it. I liked the way it looks when I write it is a good looking number or how it sounds. Sounds beautiful. Sounds perfect. A lot of people came in about the sentence sound of seven. I get on that train. I think seven comes out of your mouth real nicely. Yes. Sevens set. I just didn't feel like the number seven belongs to me. I guess. [inaudible] it even sounds good in Arabic, right? Yeah. Hebrew Sheva really similar. See it. Oh it sounds great. In Spanish. Oh this. This makes me feel a little sad. Not to get silly but on you, but there's a certain pleasure that people are getting that I'm not getting from numbers ever. Cause I feel like, like if someone says eight is curvy, part of me feels you're talking about the shape of the way that we draw than the number eight as a numeral.

Speaker 1:          15:52          That has nothing to do with the number eight talking about. It's the way I see you say eight to me. I see. I don't see eight apples. I see that curd IC, the two circles, one on top of the other best income makes me, that makes me sad. That makes me feel like you're missing the reality of the number eight which is that eight has intrinsic properties. That's really dry speak, but, but eight eight is a, I mean like 10 okay. 10 to me is much more like when you go to the bowling alley and the 10 pins are lined up in that triangle pattern. Yeah. You know what I'm talking about? Yeah. There's the one and the two then the three, then the four. That is a gorgeous way to think about 10 10 is about this magnificent symmetry that can make a triangle, but seven is a disaster as a mathematical object. I mean it doesn't have nice symmetries. If I tried to put bowling pins down with seven it's ugly. However you arrange it to me, so it makes me feel left out that I can't have the same fun that other people are having.

Speaker 1:          16:54          Okay. But if you ask Alex, why is seven the world's favorite number he says is because seven is arithmetically unique. If the only digit of the first 10 numbers that can either be multiplied or divided within the group,

Speaker 4:          17:12          so one, two, three, four, five we can double them and they stay under 10 in the group. You've got to keep them in the group six what's left? Seven weeks? We had six, eight and 10 as you can have them and the ones left are seven and nine and nine you can find by three. So seven is unique. So you think that there's enough arithmetic in everybody that without having worked it out as painfully as you just did, people will still find that there's something unusual about seven mathematically, not about memories, not about culture, not about shape, just about the math itself. You cannot separate the math of all of those things. The way we understand numbers is to do with their arithmetic and that it's, the arithmetic has been absorbed by culture and sort of the greatest example of that is the predominance of seven as the most special religious, mystical number that there is.

Speaker 7:          18:10          Oh, so he thinks it's not so much that the culture has gotten into the math. It's the other way around that the math actually was there first and then that got into the culture. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          18:22          All right. You're making me feel better.

Speaker 8:          18:33          [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          18:33          would you like to thank somebody? I would. I like to thank Steve Strogatz once again for joining us whenever we call him. I'd like to thank Sally Bellows, whose book is called the Grapes of math. How life reflects numbers and numbers reflect life. Right. Well, we should go, I guess I'm Jen [inaudible]. I'm Robert Krulwich. Thanks for listening.
