00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:09.000
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.620
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much
for coming this morning.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.760
My name is Maria Pallante.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.460
I'm the United States Register
of Copyrights, and on behalf

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.460
of the U.S. Copyright
Office, I want to welcome you

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.590
to my favorite day of
the year, World IP Day.

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.960
This year's theme as given to us

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.070
by the World Intellectual
Property Organization is

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.140
"Digital Creativity:
Culture Reimagined."

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.250
It's a great theme.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.460
It speaks to a lot of things.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:44.560
It speaks to balance.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.440
It speaks to collaboration,
and it speaks to the fact

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.010
that the digital revolution
has changed the way

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.260
that people create as well.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.800
And for the fifth year, I'm
very proud and pleased to say

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.760
that we are hosting
the Copyright Alliance.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.760
Standing here with me
is Keith Kupferschmid --

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:03.910
who will speak in a moment --

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.520
who is the head of the
Copyright Alliance.

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.310
And as usual, the Copyright
Alliance has brought

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.490
to us just an extraordinary
lineup of creators.

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.900
And we will get out of
the way as fast as we can

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.900
so that you can enjoy
your morning with them.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.990
But, before we do that, I would
like Keith to say a few words

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.430
about the Copyright Alliance.

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.550
&gt;&gt; Well, good morning,
everybody.

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:30.760
It's also one of my
favorite days of the year.

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.740
My son happens to be
born on this day as well,

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.470
so that has something
to do with it.

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.710
So I am the new CEO of
the Copyright Alliance.

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.950
Since the Copyright Alliance has
joined in the Copyright Office

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.530
in this event for the past five
years, many of you are probably

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.070
at least a little bit
familiar with Alliance,

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.710
but let me describe a little bit
of what we do and who we are.

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.860
We represent over 15,000
individual creators

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.160
and organizations from all
different copyright disciplines,

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.630
from movies, music,
literary works, software,

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.770
photography, the
arts, and so on.

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.850
Our objective is to promote
and preserve the copyright law

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.020
and to protect creators so that
they can do what they do best,

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.000
which is to create.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.430
It's a pleasure to be back
here at the Copyright Office

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.450
where I worked as a Policy
Planning Advisor many,

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.650
many, many years ago.

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.780
Back then, I can recall being
very impressed by the commitment

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.060
and passion of the
Copyright Office staff.

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.860
As I returned to the Office
in a different capacity,

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.200
it's apparent that
this commitment

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.720
and dedication continues
to be the case today.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.800
The copyright community is very,
very fortunate to have an office

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.530
that is staffed with
such devoted

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.150
and enthusiastic workforce
headed by the great leadership

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.930
of Register Pallante and
her legal and policy team,

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.530
who I see sort of scattered
about the audience here.

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.970
So, of course, it goes
without saying that we

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.210
at the Copyright
Alliance are thrilled

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:58.630
to be joining the
Copyright Office

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.520
in putting together what
will be a fantastic event.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:02.280
Trust me on this one.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.950
It's going to be fantastic.

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.920
And now, another thing you
should know about me is

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.630
that I have no creative talent.

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:08.650
I can't sing.

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.010
I can't play an instrument.

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.410
I can't act, and I
certainly don't code.

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.140
And my idea of creative
writing is putting a contraction

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:16.610
in a legal brief.

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:19.160
So I consider myself
very fortunate

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.950
to be working alongside
and for thousands

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.900
of very unbelievably talented
people, individual performers,

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.230
video game developers,
photographers, songwriters,

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:31.700
artists, directors, authors,

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.690
journalists, and
the list goes on.

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.670
And that list includes
today's panelists.

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:37.720
The group of the panelists

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.960
that we have here today are
truly the poster children

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.280
for creativity and innovation.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.080
On Capitol Hill,
the press and others

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.820
like to pit the copyright
community

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.040
against the tech community.

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.020
Like the Game of Thrones,

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.700
this makes for a very
compelling story,

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.720
but really has no
basis in reality.

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.570
The creative community is
partners and collaborators

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:01.700
with the technology community.

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.990
In many instances,
individual creators

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:07.720
and organizations are playing
dual roles, both as creators

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.140
of copyrighted works and
as technology innovators

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.690
who themselves develop new
technologies or who adopt

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:18.580
and drive demand for
technologies necessary

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:21.660
to the creation and
distribution of their works.

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.370
There are no better
examples of this

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.080
than the panelists
we have here today.

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.560
Although I don't have any
creative talents myself,

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.990
as the head of the
Copyright Alliance, it is my

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.570
and my staff's responsibility
to use our legal expertise

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:37.440
to make sure these
creators can make the most

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:38.740
out of their talents.

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:43.060
In short, my job is to make
sure creators can do their job

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:45.250
and get paid for it.

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.870
I want to briefly raise
three things that we can do

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:49.790
to help these creators.

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:53.130
The first is to modernize
the U.S. Copyright Office.

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:56.090
Few government offices are
more important to the growth

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:59.900
of creativity and commercial
activity in the United States

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.420
than the U.S. Copyright Office.

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:05.240
Despite the critical nature
of the services provided

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.800
by the Office, the Office
has failed to keep pace

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.770
with technology and
the marketplace.

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:13.830
To be clear, this is
not the fault of past

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.070
or present Registers
or the Office itself.

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:19.340
Many of these deficiencies
are the result of years

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:21.990
of budgetary neglect
and structural deficits

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:25.540
that have made it impossible
for the Office to keep pace.

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:29.190
In fact, if you look deeper into
these problems, it's evidence

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:31.120
that many of the
challenges confronted

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.670
by the Office can be
traced back to the fact

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:36.990
that the Copyright Office is
within and under the direction

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:39.980
and supervision of the
Library of Congress.

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:43.000
The Copyright Office must be
able to rapidly adapt to ensure

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.640
that it can offer the tools
and resources that all users

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:49.670
and staff of the Office demand.

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:52.240
And the best way to ensure this
is for the Copyright Office

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.660
to have control over
its IT system,

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:57.690
its budget, and its staffing.

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:00.720
Thankfully, there is a
growing groundswell of support

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:03.160
for modernization, and
the Copyright Office seems

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:04.560
to be moving in the
right direction

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:07.250
with its recently
released IT plan

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:09.530
that is both forward
thinking and pragmatic.

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:14.100
To the extent we or anyone else
has concerns with that IT plan,

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:17.420
these concerns are not with
the direction of the IT plan

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:19.950
but rather, with how
fast the Office is moving

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:21.700
in that direction.

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:24.210
The sooner newer, improved
systems can be employed

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:27.200
by the Copyright Office,
the sooner the users

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:29.390
of the Office's services
can reap the benefits

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:31.850
of IT modernization,
and we can get closer

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:34.690
to a 21st century
Copyright Office.

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:37.410
The second issue I'd like
to raise is the possibility

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:39.420
of a small claims process.

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:41.450
It's an unfortunate truth today

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:44.760
that small creators have
rights but no remedies.

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:46.730
They struggle to protect
their copyrighted works

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:47.900
from infringement.

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:50.160
Infringement actions are
particularly troublesome

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.820
for visual and literary
artists because of the nature

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:56.960
of their transactions and
the volume of their work.

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.610
One reason for this problem is
the excessive litigation costs

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:04.070
required for bringing a
claim in federal court.

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:06.100
We need to fix this.

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:08.220
One way to do that
is for creators

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:10.910
to bring small infringement
claims before a Copyright Office

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:13.420
small claims tribunal,
instead of it having

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:14.470
to go to federal court.

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:16.740
And that's something
we should make happen.

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:21.420
The last issue, before we get to
the panel and other speakers --

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:23.150
the last issue I'd like
to raise is commonly --

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:27.010
what is commonly referred to
as the "all vid proposal."

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:29.520
The all vid proposal is
a proposal by the FCC

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:33.060
that will require cable and
satellite TV distributors

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:35.420
to allow third parties
to provide subscribers

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:37.720
with their own set
top box through which

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:40.960
to access the TV programming
that is licensed to the --

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:43.880
by the TV distributor.

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:47.560
While this might sound
innocuous and even laudatory,

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:50.650
the all vid proposal does not
merely allow third parties

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:55.320
to sell TV subscribers a
cheaper or better set top box.

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:58.970
What it does is allow that third
party, who has not paid a dime

00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:02.040
to license the copyrighted
TV programming,

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:04.900
to offer their own
commercial video service

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:07.100
that includes that programming.

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:10.180
In other words, the all vid
proposal will create a class

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:13.770
of free riders that don't
have to pay for TV programming

00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:16.610
but are allowed to
make money from it.

00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:18.500
The primary form of compensation

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:20.060
for creative professionals
responsible

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:23.000
for the video content --
the directors, the writers,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.670
the designers, the actors,
composers, costume makers,

00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:29.800
visual effect specialists,
film crews composed of grips

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:33.590
and cameramen -- they're all
governed by complex contractual

00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:36.260
or collective bargaining
agreements that provide

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:39.350
for residuals, participation
rights,

00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:42.950
or contributions toward
health and pension benefits.

00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:46.350
By allowing the distribution
and public performance of video

00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:49.860
and entertainment works
outside of these agreements,

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:51.770
the FCC is undermining
the system

00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:54.030
by which creators
are compensated

00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:56.900
and harming the very people
responsible for the works

00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:59.550
that consumers want to watch.

00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:02.340
While the Copyright Alliance
encourages the development

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:05.510
of new technologies to bring
licensed works to the public

00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:09.020
in new and innovative ways,
we are gravely concerned

00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:11.580
that the FCC's proposal
will permanently

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:14.720
and significantly harm these
creative professionals.

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:16.230
And so with that, you've
heard enough from me.

00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:18.180
I will turn things
over to Maria.

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:19.510
Thank you.

00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:27.080
[ Applause ]

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:28.020
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Keith.

00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:30.910
Thank you for not saying
anything controversial.

00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:37.620
World IP Day, of course,
doesn't come together in a --

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:41.040
with a wave of a magic wand.

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:44.480
So I want to thank a few people,
if you could raise your hand.

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:48.290
From the Copyright Alliance:
Sarah, Eileen and Claudia.

00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:51.960
And from my team:
Syreeta Swann - so shy.

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:54.950
Syreeta is in the very back.

00:09:54.950 --> 00:09:56.450
So thank you.

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:02.290
Thank you, guys.

00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:05.080
In putting this event together,
I also want to thank those

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:06.070
of you who are

00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:10.580
from organizations also putting
together IP events today,

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:12.770
and also, we're very
sensitive to the fact that many

00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:15.290
of you are running
from event to event.

00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:19.360
We tried very hard to
schedule our event at a time

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:21.070
that would not conflict
with other events.

00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:23.390
We weren't entirely
successful there,

00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:26.400
in part because of Chairman
Goodlatte's schedule,

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:28.250
in part because of the flights

00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:31.790
of our extraordinary
artistic talent that has come

00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:34.420
into D.C. today to be with you.

00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:39.600
So, as it turns out, Chairman
Goodlatte has pre-recorded his

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:43.420
remarks today so that we could
hold this event in the morning

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:46.290
to make sure that we had all
of our artistic team here.

00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:49.530
And I'll introduce
him in a moment.

00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:53.820
What I wanted to say,
though, is that if you go back

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:56.730
to Copyright Review three years
ago, you know that the advice

00:10:56.730 --> 00:10:59.320
of the Copyright
Office to Congress was

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:02.580
that the time had come for them
to step back and look at all

00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:05.260
of the different
issues that a variety

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.010
of stakeholders were
putting forward

00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:11.610
as the singular most
important issue or, in fact,

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:14.970
the issue that Congress
should stay away from

00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:17.630
and let the marketplace handle.

00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:20.340
And our advice to
Congress was that Congress

00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:23.030
and Congress alone has
the role constitutionally

00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:26.080
of balancing all of those public
equities and stepping back

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:31.190
and then deciding whether to
act or whether to revise the law

00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:33.840
or whether to monitor
marketplace developments,

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:36.650
all of which are the
domain of Congress.

00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:42.240
In making that recommendation,
we noted that in order for that

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:45.860
to happen, you need to have
committee leadership in Congress

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:49.550
that has a meaningful degree of
fluency in the Copyright Act,

00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:54.750
as well as a staff committed
to that committee or committees

00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:57.270
that also has a meaningful
degree of fluency

00:11:57.270 --> 00:12:00.280
and a commitment to
keep copyright moving

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:03.240
from session to session.

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:06.220
And as such, we were
absolutely pleased

00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:09.100
that Chairman Goodlatte first
put Copyright Review before the

00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:12.950
Subcommittee on Intellectual
Property and then moved it

00:12:12.950 --> 00:12:15.690
to the full committee
level, where it still is,

00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:18.900
and as we move to the
next session of Congress,

00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:23.110
I just want to make sure that we
all thank him for stepping back

00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:25.570
and running such an
incredibly transparent

00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:27.740
and comprehensive process.

00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:30.480
And you're probably
wondering what's next.

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:33.610
And I think you'll find that
in his recorded remarks,

00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:35.560
he answers that question.

00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:48.000
So although he's not here,
let me introduce him.

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:53.240
Some things you may
not know about him.

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:54.730
So you know that
he is the Chairman

00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:56.740
of the House Judiciary
Committee.

00:12:56.740 --> 00:13:00.070
How many of you knew that he is
the first Judiciary Committee

00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:04.620
Chairman from Virginia
in the last 125 years?

00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:07.150
Raise your hand if
you knew that.

00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:09.130
That's an extraordinary fact.

00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:11.310
The House Judiciary
Committee, aside from looking

00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:13.410
at copyright law, is at
the forefront of some

00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:15.850
of the most significant
issues of the day,

00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:17.910
including protecting
constitutional freedoms

00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:20.520
and civil liberties, oversight
of the U.S. Departments

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:23.660
of Justice and Homeland
Security, legal and regulatory,

00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:26.140
[inaudible] innovation,
competition and antitrust laws,

00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:28.750
terrorism, crime,
and immigration.

00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:32.110
Many of these issues will
be the deciding factors

00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:34.590
in determining the future
direction of our nation.

00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:35.280
The jurisdiction

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:37.490
of the Judiciary Committee
is well suited to many

00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:40.550
of Bob's legislative
priorities, which are IP,

00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:43.440
constitutional rights,
private property,

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:45.680
Second Amendment rights,
securing our borders,

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:50.370
strengthening our criminal
laws, and so forth.

00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:53.010
We are indebted, of course,
in the copyright community

00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:57.910
for his very forward thinking
and thoughtful leadership,

00:13:57.910 --> 00:14:00.840
and without further ado, I'd
like to introduce, virtually,

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:03.640
Bob Goodlatte, Chairman of
the House Judiciary Committee.

00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:08.180
&gt;&gt; Thanks for the opportunity to
give remarks at today's event.

00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:10.350
Unfortunately, I had a
preexisting commitment

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:12.790
in Charlottesville this
morning that prevented me

00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:14.730
from being with you in person.

00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:16.850
Three years ago, the
Committee began a process

00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:19.790
to thoroughly review our
nation's copyright law,

00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:23.140
an overdue effort that
resulted in gathering input

00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:26.630
from a diverse range of
copyright creators, owners,

00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:29.720
distributors, platforms,
and end users.

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:33.110
Beginning with 100 witnesses
at 20 formal hearings,

00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:36.320
the Committee then traveled
to Nashville, Santa Clara,

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:39.680
and Los Angeles for
three public roundtables

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:41.290
with over 60 participants.

00:14:41.290 --> 00:14:44.850
Committee staff then followed
up with all prior witnesses

00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:47.320
and those who had expressed
an interest in copyright,

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:49.290
to develop a comprehensive
record

00:14:49.290 --> 00:14:53.170
of the issues facing the
American copyright system today.

00:14:53.170 --> 00:14:55.960
What copyright issues did
the Committee hear about?

00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:58.090
More than most could imagine.

00:14:58.090 --> 00:14:59.940
Some of the topics included:

00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:03.360
In what ways can consensus be
achieved in copyright policy?

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:04.720
How does copyright

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:07.540
and technology create
innovation in America?

00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:10.260
What is the proper role
of voluntary agreements

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:11.630
and how can they be encouraged?

00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:14.980
Does the scope of copyright
protection need updating?

00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:18.510
Does the fair use balance,
as it exists today,

00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:22.210
reflect congressional intent
when it was first codified?

00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:26.570
Is section 512 working well
for all interested parties?

00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:30.870
Are bad faith actors abusing
the notice and takedown system?

00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:35.240
Does U.S. law create the proper
framework for the preservation

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:39.150
and reuse of copyrighted works
that are either deteriorating

00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:41.850
or lacking copyright
ownership information?

00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:46.100
Is the current compulsory
video license framework the

00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:47.040
best approach?

00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:49.790
How is first sale
working in a world

00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:51.680
of mixed and digital goods?

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:55.630
Does the music licensing system
work to the detriment or success

00:15:55.630 --> 00:15:58.490
of musicians, and is the
current compulsory license

00:15:58.490 --> 00:15:59.420
system working?

00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:03.190
Is the termination rights
framework too complicated?

00:16:03.190 --> 00:16:08.000
Does the U.S. need greater moral
rights or a resell royalty?

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.480
Does the current remedies
framework reflect an appropriate

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:14.920
balance between providing
compensation for damages,

00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:18.860
for actual losses, while
deterring future infringements?

00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:22.350
Does this same remedies
framework provide a meaningful

00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:26.060
enforcement right for
smaller copyright claims?

00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:28.400
Do the anti-circumvention
provisions

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:32.040
of Chapter 12 efficiently
determine exemptions

00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:35.290
for adverse effects
on non-infringing uses

00:16:35.290 --> 00:16:38.560
or for security and
encryption research?

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:41.550
Are the needs of the visually
impaired community being met?

00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:44.920
What is the impact of current
copyright law upon students,

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:47.750
professors, and their
academic institutions?

00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:49.730
Is the Copyright
Office functioning well

00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:52.780
in its present framework, or
is there another framework

00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:54.020
that would work better?

00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:57.940
What are the resources and
information technology necessary

00:16:57.940 --> 00:17:00.270
for the Copyright
Office to function well?

00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:03.370
While not all of these questions
are of interest to everyone

00:17:03.370 --> 00:17:04.750
in the copyright system,

00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:07.470
they demonstrate the
interconnected nature

00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:09.530
of U.S. copyright law.

00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:12.820
Simply changing a paragraph
here and a word or two there

00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:16.670
in Title 17 may have a
major impact far beyond its

00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:18.100
intended approach.

00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:19.360
Thus, it is critical

00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:23.160
that Congress understand the
overall impact of any changes

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:25.400
in copyright law
before proceeding

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:27.810
with formally introduced
legislation.

00:17:27.810 --> 00:17:32.040
It is also clear that neither a
solely copyright owner-focused

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:35.520
bill nor a copyright
user-focused bill could be

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:38.780
enacted by Congress
today nor should they be.

00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:40.200
Any potential changes

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:43.900
to copyright law cannot be
based upon mere talking points

00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:45.310
of interested parties.

00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:48.250
Copyright law, much like
all of the other titles

00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:50.820
of the U.S. Code, are
about the details.

00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:53.430
Words matter, not bullet points.

00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:56.220
In the weeks ahead,
we will identify areas

00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:59.380
where there is a likelihood,
a potential consensus,

00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:00.760
and circulate outlines

00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:03.200
of potential reforms
in those areas.

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:06.190
Then, we will convene
stakeholders for further work

00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:08.280
on these potential reforms.

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:10.260
And you have my personal
commitment

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:12.930
that as the review shifts
to more focused work

00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:16.060
on potential reforms, the
process will be transparent,

00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:18.180
and the Committee will
continue to ensure

00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:21.710
that all interested parties
have the opportunity to weigh

00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:23.610
in on issues of concern to them.

00:18:23.610 --> 00:18:26.950
Our copyright system
deserves no less.

00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:28.410
While no one can guarantee

00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:31.510
that every interested party
will share the same views

00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:35.040
on every copyright policy
issue, I can guarantee

00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:37.940
that we will have an open
ear to everyone who wants

00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:39.890
to contribute to this process.

00:18:39.890 --> 00:18:41.520
All views are welcome.

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:43.120
Thank you again for
the opportunity

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:44.660
to speak with you today.

00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:47.330
When our nation's founders
included intellectual property

00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:50.340
in our constitution, they
recognized the importance

00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:53.470
of creativity to our
nation and our economy.

00:18:53.470 --> 00:18:57.500
We need to ensure that our laws
continue to promote creativity

00:18:57.500 --> 00:18:59.830
and innovation in
the digital age.

00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:07.850
I look forward to working
with you in the months ahead.

00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:08.150
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:10.970
So you've heard from
all of us policy

00:19:10.970 --> 00:19:13.060
and Washington D.C.-based folks.

00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:15.370
It's now time to turn the panel

00:19:15.370 --> 00:19:18.500
over to the real interesting
people, the creators

00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:20.080
and our creators' panel.

00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:23.630
And so I want to introduce our
moderator and ask Devlin to come

00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:25.550
on up here and take a seat.

00:19:25.550 --> 00:19:27.310
Devlin Hartline is
our moderator.

00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:31.710
He is the Assistant Director at
George Mason's Law School Center

00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:35.020
for the Protection of
Intellectual Property or CPIP.

00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:37.940
At CPIP, Devlin leads
CPIP's communication

00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:40.950
and academic advisory
efforts, working closely

00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:44.920
with CPIP scholars to publicize
and promote rigorous research

00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:47.760
on the law, on economics,
and on history

00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:50.860
of intellectual property,
and he also writes a really,

00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:54.330
really good blog so you should
check it out at lawtheories.com.

00:19:54.330 --> 00:19:58.510
So Devlin, why don't
you come on up?

00:19:58.510 --> 00:20:04.140
[ Applause ]

00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:06.540
&gt;&gt; Good morning, everybody,
and happy World IP Day.

00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:10.420
We have an exciting
panel for you, but first,

00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:14.180
I want to thank Register
Pallante for hosting this event,

00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:16.940
and I want to thank Keith
and the Copyright Alliance,

00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:18.980
and I especially
want to thank Sarah

00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:20.380
for organizing the panelists

00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:23.720
and handing me all these
fancy questions to ask them.

00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:24.940
So, thank you.

00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:28.130
So we've got three
creators on our panel today,

00:20:28.130 --> 00:20:30.260
and without further ado, I'd
like to get them on the stage

00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:32.320
so we could get started.

00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:34.270
The first is Jared Geller.

00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:35.810
He's the Executive Producer

00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:41.510
of the open-collaborative
production company, HITRECORD.

00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:47.310
[ Applause ]

00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:48.970
Next up is Anna Metcalfe.

00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:52.700
She's a ceramic artist and the
founder of the wedding registry,

00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:55.180
Gather, which enables guests

00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:58.040
to give local art
for wedding gifts.

00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:00.070
[ Applause ]

00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:03.560
And, last but not least,
is photographer, founder,

00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:08.710
and CEO of CreativeLive,
Chase Jarvis.

00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:11.290
CreativeLive is the world's
largest live streaming education

00:21:11.290 --> 00:21:15.340
company focused on photography,
video, design, music,

00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:18.510
and entrepreneurship education.

00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:22.310
[ Applause ]

00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:24.410
So we're going to start
with presentations

00:21:24.410 --> 00:21:26.690
from the panelists, and then
we'll move into the questions.

00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:29.540
Jared, you're up.

00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:33.310
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

00:21:33.310 --> 00:21:36.120
It's so exciting to
be recognized by --

00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:39.500
first of all, it's
great to learn

00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:40.810
that there was a World IP Day,

00:21:40.810 --> 00:21:44.090
so that's just --
happy World IP Day.

00:21:44.090 --> 00:21:47.270
But it was really such
an honor to be recognized

00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:48.520
by the Copyright Alliance

00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:52.530
and by the Copyright
Office to present today.

00:21:52.530 --> 00:21:55.080
I actually brought
along two videos.

00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:59.020
One to introduce who
we are at HITRECORD.

00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:01.720
I think that's probably
the best way to -- yeah --

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:06.890
to explain who we
are and what we do.

00:22:06.890 --> 00:22:10.140
So, without further ado.

00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:12.710
&gt;&gt; Okay. Recording.

00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:15.040
Hello and welcome to HITRECORD.

00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:17.720
I'm Joe. I started this
place a long time ago

00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:19.140
with my brother, Dan.

00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:21.710
And it's a little bit different
than your typical internet,

00:22:21.710 --> 00:22:23.380
social network kind of thing.

00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:26.120
The point here isn't to keep
in touch with your friends

00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:28.920
or to follow celebrities or even

00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:31.850
to showcase something
you made on your own.

00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:35.650
The point here is to
make things together.

00:22:35.650 --> 00:22:40.290
HITRECORD is a new kind
of production company,

00:22:40.290 --> 00:22:42.780
and we produce all
kinds of art and media.

00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:44.780
We've played short
films at film festivals.

00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:45.600
We published books.

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:46.620
We put out records.

00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:50.830
We made a TV show that won
an Emmy, and our website

00:22:50.830 --> 00:22:52.970
and our mobile app is
designed to allow anybody

00:22:52.970 --> 00:22:57.100
to come join this community and
contribute to those productions.

00:22:57.100 --> 00:22:59.670
And yes, any time one of
our productions makes money,

00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:02.810
the contributors
get fairly paid.

00:23:02.810 --> 00:23:05.590
So, certainly, if you are
an artist of any kind,

00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:09.160
if you're a writer, a filmmaker,
musician, graphic artist,

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:11.030
photographer, illustrator,
animator, editor,

00:23:11.030 --> 00:23:12.820
or anything, come work with us.

00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:15.670
Or even if you don't
fancy yourself an artist

00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:18.900
but you've got a good story to
tell or just something to say,

00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:20.390
that can make a great
inspiration

00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:21.430
for one of our projects.

00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:23.810
If you've got good taste and
you want to give feedback

00:23:23.810 --> 00:23:26.520
on the stuff we're making here,
if you want to curate the things

00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:29.600
that you see on here that you
like, that's really valuable.

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:32.070
Or if you don't want to do
any of that, and you just want

00:23:32.070 --> 00:23:34.180
to hang out and watch
how it happens

00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:36.740
and maybe meet a few cool
people, that's all right too.

00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:39.400
But it's really fun
if you join in.

00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:40.530
Now, how does this all work?

00:23:40.530 --> 00:23:41.560
Where do you get started?

00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:42.470
One good place to start is

00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:44.130
with what we call
creative challenges.

00:23:44.130 --> 00:23:47.050
So this is for those times
when you know you want

00:23:47.050 --> 00:23:48.670
to do something creative,

00:23:48.670 --> 00:23:50.810
but you don't know exactly
what you want to do.

00:23:50.810 --> 00:23:52.580
This site will serve
you up a whole bunch

00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:54.590
of different challenges,
and you'll find probably

00:23:54.590 --> 00:23:57.770
at least one that inspires
you at that moment in time.

00:23:57.770 --> 00:24:00.090
I issue a lot of the
challenges as do the fine folks

00:24:00.090 --> 00:24:01.350
who work here in this office,

00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:03.630
but anybody can issue
their own challenges.

00:24:03.630 --> 00:24:06.360
So, for example, say you
shot a bunch of footage,

00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:08.170
and you're looking
for a video editor,

00:24:08.170 --> 00:24:10.480
you can upload your raw footage
and then issue a challenge

00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:12.390
to editors and say,
"Here's all my footage.

00:24:12.390 --> 00:24:13.560
Let's see you guys
cut it together."

00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:16.740
Which brings us to remix.

00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:17.950
So when you upload
something here,

00:24:17.950 --> 00:24:20.830
everybody else has permission
to download it, sample it,

00:24:20.830 --> 00:24:23.160
revise it, refine it,
build on top of it,

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:24.550
and upload their new version.

00:24:24.550 --> 00:24:27.470
So, for example, say you're
a singer and you're looking

00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:30.170
for an instrumental to sing
on top of, there's tons

00:24:30.170 --> 00:24:32.500
of great instrumental pieces
of music on HITRECORD,

00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:36.210
and you can write a
song on top of that.

00:24:36.210 --> 00:24:42.360
If you're an animator, you
can go find an illustration,

00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:44.150
download it, put in
the after effects,

00:24:44.150 --> 00:24:45.720
and turn it into
some kind of cartoon.

00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:49.270
Writers, you know that good
writing is in the rewriting.

00:24:49.270 --> 00:24:51.520
So if you see something on
the site that you like --

00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:53.000
this is a good piece of writing,

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.340
but I have a different
idea for it, do that.

00:24:55.340 --> 00:24:56.210
Write a new draft.

00:24:56.210 --> 00:24:56.700
Punch it up.

00:24:56.700 --> 00:24:57.650
Add some jokes.

00:24:57.650 --> 00:24:58.410
Change the ending.

00:24:58.410 --> 00:25:01.400
Think of this as a huge
worldwide writer's room.

00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:05.570
So now comes the question:
how does all of that lead

00:25:05.570 --> 00:25:07.380
to a cohesive, finished product?

00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:10.100
So I, as well as other folks
who work here in this office,

00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:13.200
we're always on the lookout for
stuff coming through our site

00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:16.180
that we can sort of take to
the traditional marketplace.

00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:18.870
Who decides which projects
become productions,

00:25:18.870 --> 00:25:22.160
and who has sort of final cut on
how those productions turn out?

00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:23.970
It's a simple answer,
and it's me.

00:25:23.970 --> 00:25:26.300
I'm the director of
this production company.

00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:29.290
But, like every great director
that I've ever worked with,

00:25:29.290 --> 00:25:32.290
I know that, as a director,
I'm nothing without the artists

00:25:32.290 --> 00:25:33.200
that I'm collaborating with.

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:34.080
Now, like I said before,

00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:35.530
when one of our productions
makes money,

00:25:35.530 --> 00:25:38.670
we do pay the contributing
artists, and I'm proud to say,

00:25:38.670 --> 00:25:41.390
since 2010, we've paid different
contributing artists all

00:25:41.390 --> 00:25:46.670
over the world almost
$2 million dollars.

00:25:46.670 --> 00:25:51.420
So, I know nobody wants to
join another internet thing.

00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:54.320
We all have too many user names
and passwords to remember.

00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:58.330
But, all those hours you
spend on the internet can add

00:25:58.330 --> 00:26:02.020
up to something, and I'm
really proud of the stuff

00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:03.550
that we've made together.

00:26:03.550 --> 00:26:06.110
There's more stuff we're making
all the time, and I'd love

00:26:06.110 --> 00:26:07.740
for you to be a part of it.

00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:10.100
So -- thanks.

00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:18.870
[ Music ]

00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:22.520
So that's who we are.

00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:26.710
So you can imagine that we
spend -- to make all that work,

00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:31.750
we spend a lot of time thinking
about copyright laws and terms

00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:33.890
of service and licensing
and monetization

00:26:33.890 --> 00:26:36.540
and all of those things.

00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:40.410
And since we spend so much time
on this and thinking about:

00:26:40.410 --> 00:26:42.520
okay, we want to do this,
we want to work with artists

00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:46.160
around the world, and they're
contributing their ideas,

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:47.000
their art, their IP.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:51.960
How do we make sure that
they're represented fairly

00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:54.060
and that they're paid fairly

00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:57.180
and what we do is
all very transparent?

00:26:57.180 --> 00:26:59.770
And so like I said, we
spend a lot of time thinking

00:26:59.770 --> 00:27:02.240
about the ways in
which we do that.

00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:07.190
So to be recognized by you guys
and actually to get to know some

00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:09.370
of the people who are
here in D.C. working

00:27:09.370 --> 00:27:13.090
on this stuff is
extremely exciting.

00:27:13.090 --> 00:27:17.490
And I -- when I told Joseph
Gordon-Levitt that we were going

00:27:17.490 --> 00:27:20.430
to be participating in
this, he was excited,

00:27:20.430 --> 00:27:23.180
so we made actually this
video specifically for today.

00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:25.880
And yeah, take that away.

00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:27.810
&gt;&gt; We're recording.

00:27:27.810 --> 00:27:29.510
Hey, everybody.

00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:31.550
My name is Joseph Gordon-Levitt.

00:27:31.550 --> 00:27:35.990
I work in movies and TV,

00:27:35.990 --> 00:27:38.920
and I also started a
company called HITRECORD.

00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:41.240
It's an online community
that works together

00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:43.780
as a media production company.

00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:46.550
Obviously, I'm pretty
interested in the topic

00:27:46.550 --> 00:27:49.030
of intellectual property.

00:27:49.030 --> 00:27:52.710
I'm glad we're dedicating
a day to talking about it.

00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:54.910
I actually think the
way that we figure

00:27:54.910 --> 00:27:58.180
out how intellectual property
is going to work today

00:27:58.180 --> 00:28:00.040
and especially how it's
going to work moving

00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:04.170
in the future is going to be
a huge part of us succeeding

00:28:04.170 --> 00:28:07.310
as a -- as a human race.

00:28:07.310 --> 00:28:12.950
So one thing I'll say is in the
past, I used to be of one mind,

00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:16.310
which is, the whole notion that
information wants to be free

00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:18.340
and that anything you can
put into ones and zeroes

00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:21.080
because you can just copy it
as many times as you want,

00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:22.310
it shouldn't cost anything.

00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:23.900
It shouldn't be worth money.

00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:28.080
And my mind really changed
a lot a couple of years ago.

00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:30.730
And it was largely this one
book that got me thinking

00:28:30.730 --> 00:28:32.390
of it differently that
I really recommend.

00:28:32.390 --> 00:28:34.580
And the book is called
Who Owns the Future?

00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:36.790
And it's by a writer
named Jaron Lanier.

00:28:36.790 --> 00:28:37.790
His contention is

00:28:37.790 --> 00:28:40.200
that intellectual
property is worth money,

00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:44.520
and it has to be worth money
for capitalism to keep working.

00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:47.840
Right now, this sort of
notion or you might say,

00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:51.100
the myth that intellectual
property is not worth money,

00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:54.810
has largely decimated the music
industry, is doing quite a bit

00:28:54.810 --> 00:28:58.820
of damage to the field of
journalism, but moving forward,

00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:02.480
it could damage so much more
than just those industries.

00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:04.890
And another thing
that Mr. Lanier points

00:29:04.890 --> 00:29:07.100
out is digital information,

00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:09.320
intellectual property,
it is worth money.

00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:10.710
It does generate money.

00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:13.830
It's just that right now, when
we're sort of under the illusion

00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:15.760
that it's free, all
of the money,

00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:18.510
all of the value generated by
that intellectual property,

00:29:18.510 --> 00:29:23.230
is just going to a few big
internet giants like Google,

00:29:23.230 --> 00:29:26.700
Facebook, etc. because
those companies sort

00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:31.830
of trade information, getting
information to its consumers

00:29:31.830 --> 00:29:35.190
for free while advertising to
them and making tons and tons

00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:37.970
and tons of money because
they're not compensating the

00:29:37.970 --> 00:29:39.630
people who generated
the information

00:29:39.630 --> 00:29:40.430
that they're delivering.

00:29:40.430 --> 00:29:43.810
And so the notion that
intellectual property

00:29:43.810 --> 00:29:45.760
in the digital form
is not worth money,

00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:47.400
that's something I
think we need to sort

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:49.200
of get past and get over.

00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:52.560
It has to be worth money in
order for our economy to work.

00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:56.520
I'll give you another example,

00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:58.550
and that's my company,
HITRECORD.

00:29:58.550 --> 00:29:59.790
We make all kinds of things.

00:29:59.790 --> 00:30:03.830
We make short films and
music, books, made a TV show,

00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:06.840
and our company is sort of
founded on the principle

00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:09.630
that yeah, actually the
artists who do contribute

00:30:09.630 --> 00:30:10.980
to these things, even
though they're making their

00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:13.630
contributions digitally,
they deserve to be paid,

00:30:13.630 --> 00:30:15.950
and that if we make
money as a company,

00:30:15.950 --> 00:30:18.260
HITRECORD compensates
the artists

00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:21.950
and the contributors whose
intellectual property generates

00:30:21.950 --> 00:30:23.070
that value.

00:30:23.070 --> 00:30:25.180
I'm not saying everybody
should do it this way,

00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:27.750
but this is a way that
we have found to work.

00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:30.370
Over the last five or six years
that we've been doing this,

00:30:30.370 --> 00:30:32.440
we've paid out almost $2 million

00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:34.660
to different artists
all over the world.

00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:36.230
It's been a beautiful
thing for me.

00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:38.850
A lot of people who get paid

00:30:38.850 --> 00:30:40.840
from HITRECORD productions
have never been paid

00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:43.020
for their art before, and
that's a wonderful feeling.

00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:47.860
Even besides the actual amount
of money, just the principle

00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:51.960
of getting paid, it
feels validating,

00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:55.260
and I think the folks who
do get paid, they deserve

00:30:55.260 --> 00:30:58.310
to feel validated because
their contribution helps

00:30:58.310 --> 00:30:59.430
to make money.

00:30:59.430 --> 00:31:02.830
We designed our terms
of service to do this.

00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:05.390
We have a unique legal
agreement that everybody

00:31:05.390 --> 00:31:08.610
who joins our site and
contributes to our projects

00:31:08.610 --> 00:31:10.300
because they've clicked
a box and they've agreed

00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:12.670
to these terms of service,
and this terms of service lays

00:31:12.670 --> 00:31:14.620
out this methodology of payment.

00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:16.910
That's also important,
having fair

00:31:16.910 --> 00:31:19.560
and transparence in
terms of service.

00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:23.240
It not only helps the members
of our community who are able

00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:26.110
to get paid for their work,
it helps us as a company.

00:31:26.110 --> 00:31:30.150
I definitely think the trust
that we earned by having fair

00:31:30.150 --> 00:31:33.120
and transparent terms of service
has really benefitted us.

00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:36.580
But again, it goes back
to the principle then.

00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:38.900
Just because somebody's
contribution is digital,

00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:40.410
doesn't mean it's
not worth money.

00:31:40.410 --> 00:31:45.140
And if some work that
someone did made money,

00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:47.440
then they deserve to get paid.

00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:48.680
I'll leave it there.

00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:49.790
Thanks for listening.

00:31:49.790 --> 00:31:51.630
And again, thanks
for having this day,

00:31:51.630 --> 00:31:53.860
talking about intellectual
property.

00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:59.570
I think it's something really
well worth talking about.

00:31:59.570 --> 00:32:01.510
Thanks again.

00:32:01.510 --> 00:32:07.140
[ Music ]

00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:08.970
Thanks a lot.

00:32:11.510 --> 00:32:17.040
[ Applause ]

00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:18.800
&gt;&gt; Good morning, everyone.

00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:21.060
Happy Intellectual Property Day.

00:32:21.060 --> 00:32:24.170
I, too, was excited to
find out that it existed.

00:32:24.170 --> 00:32:28.130
And I'm super happy
to be here and honored

00:32:28.130 --> 00:32:32.070
to have been chosen
to be a part of this.

00:32:32.070 --> 00:32:34.330
My name is Anna Metcalfe.

00:32:34.330 --> 00:32:38.000
And I'm originally from
Virginia, but in 2006,

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.540
I moved to Minneapolis where
I graduated with my MFA

00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:45.400
in Ceramics from the
University of Minnesota.

00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:52.360
My personal work ranges from
public art, installation,

00:32:53.650 --> 00:32:59.380
community engagement,
and dinnerware.

00:32:59.380 --> 00:33:00.820
I'm also an educator.

00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:03.850
I teach ceramics at the
University of Minnesota,

00:33:03.850 --> 00:33:07.990
and I also teach business skills
to artists all over the Midwest

00:33:07.990 --> 00:33:11.070
with an organization called
Springboard for the Arts.

00:33:12.090 --> 00:33:14.980
I'm here this morning
as one of three founders

00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:17.550
of a web-based startup
called Gather Art Registry.

00:33:17.550 --> 00:33:21.910
We are in our ninth
month of our first year.

00:33:21.910 --> 00:33:25.630
We were friends long before
we were business partners,

00:33:25.630 --> 00:33:28.650
and we had a lightbulb
moment one day.

00:33:28.650 --> 00:33:32.730
My now business partner, Rachel,
was purchasing a ceramic piece

00:33:32.730 --> 00:33:34.720
for me for a friend's wedding.

00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:36.270
And as I was wrapping
up the gift

00:33:36.270 --> 00:33:39.210
on my front porch,
she made a comment.

00:33:39.210 --> 00:33:41.520
"Couples should be able to
register for art they know

00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:44.280
and love for their weddings,
and I should be able to buy it

00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:46.840
for them just like I can
buy towels and toasters

00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:49.660
from Macy's online registry."

00:33:49.660 --> 00:33:52.320
I said "Yes, they should.

00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:54.240
That should be a thing.

00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:56.380
And it should be carefully
curated and presented

00:33:56.380 --> 00:34:00.530
to highlight the value of the
art in our community to buyers."

00:34:00.530 --> 00:34:02.100
So that got us wondering.

00:34:02.100 --> 00:34:05.960
What if it was possible for
people to register for local art

00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:08.030
for their wedding, and what

00:34:08.030 --> 00:34:10.900
if an online registry platform
could make it really easy

00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:13.700
for their friends and family
to buy couples handmade gifts?

00:34:13.700 --> 00:34:16.190
And that is how Gather was born.

00:34:16.190 --> 00:34:21.210
It combines three
basic ingredients: art,

00:34:21.210 --> 00:34:22.840
wedding gifts, and the internet.

00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:28.150
We learned how to write a
business plan after that.

00:34:28.150 --> 00:34:32.160
We began contracting with local
artists, and in early 2014,

00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:34.480
we started Gather LLC.

00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:38.990
After an Indiegogo
campaign in late 2014,

00:34:38.990 --> 00:34:43.240
we launched our registry
in the summer of 2015.

00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:46.870
Now, midway through our
first wedding season,

00:34:46.870 --> 00:34:49.090
we're in the process of
adding to our collection

00:34:49.090 --> 00:34:51.890
and expanding our audience.

00:34:51.890 --> 00:34:56.330
This is an example of a
product page on our site.

00:34:56.330 --> 00:35:01.590
To create -- our mission is
pretty simple actually --

00:35:01.590 --> 00:35:05.300
it's to create a new market
for artists and their work.

00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:07.490
It's to provide a platform
that meets the demands

00:35:07.490 --> 00:35:11.040
of a new generation of
shoppers and art collectors.

00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:14.580
And it's also to educate new
audiences about the value

00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:18.900
of art and handmade crafts.

00:35:18.900 --> 00:35:22.860
I personally curate our
collection from artists

00:35:22.860 --> 00:35:25.460
from around Minnesota
and Wisconsin.

00:35:25.460 --> 00:35:28.040
We offer items like what
you see in this image:

00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:32.450
hand forged bottle openers
from antique wrenches,

00:35:32.450 --> 00:35:34.500
laser etched coasters,

00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:38.290
hand carved mugs,
and original prints.

00:35:38.290 --> 00:35:40.150
We also make it possible
for couples

00:35:40.150 --> 00:35:44.160
to commission original work
from their favorite artists.

00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:46.170
Erin and Jay, who got
married last August,

00:35:46.170 --> 00:35:49.620
wanted to commission Minneapolis
artist, Nicholas Harper,

00:35:49.620 --> 00:35:51.990
to paint an original
work for them based

00:35:51.990 --> 00:35:56.310
on their favorite novel called
Geek Love by Katherine Dunn.

00:35:56.310 --> 00:35:59.280
He obliged, and after
reading the book,

00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:02.630
he created a painting based
on two of the main characters

00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:05.010
who happen to be Siamese twins.

00:36:05.010 --> 00:36:08.680
It was a very interesting
collaboration.

00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:10.650
This is an image
of the unveiling

00:36:10.650 --> 00:36:13.820
that we had last month.

00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:16.720
Like any small business, our
path is filled with discoveries

00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:19.270
and challenges that lead
us to make adjustments

00:36:19.270 --> 00:36:23.380
that benefit both
artists and our customers.

00:36:23.380 --> 00:36:27.760
However, like artists, we find
ourselves navigating systems

00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:29.460
and structures that
have been constructed

00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:32.570
by software engineers
and marketplaces

00:36:32.570 --> 00:36:37.940
that don't always take the arts
or artists into consideration.

00:36:37.940 --> 00:36:41.090
Our mission is to create
an easy to navigate bridge

00:36:41.090 --> 00:36:43.710
between the wedding industry
and the creative work of artists

00:36:43.710 --> 00:36:45.710
through an ecommerce platform.

00:36:45.710 --> 00:36:50.730
Our challenges are a result of
the potential incompatibilities

00:36:50.730 --> 00:36:53.970
between creative
tendencies and audiences

00:36:53.970 --> 00:36:55.160
that understand the value

00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:57.920
as being produced
by big box stores.

00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:02.300
What is true for artists -- that
creativity requires an abundance

00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:06.190
of time, the willingness to be
open to unexpected outcomes,

00:37:06.190 --> 00:37:08.870
and that innovation
requires constant change --

00:37:08.870 --> 00:37:10.350
are actually the very things

00:37:10.350 --> 00:37:12.600
that make our mission
challenging in a marketplace

00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:18.270
that demands fast turnarounds,
consistency, and predictability.

00:37:18.270 --> 00:37:22.510
Where an artist finds
time to be an asset,

00:37:22.510 --> 00:37:29.380
our customers are looking for
shortcuts and fast shipping.

00:37:29.380 --> 00:37:30.740
Where an artist --

00:37:30.740 --> 00:37:34.010
where constant change is a
positive marker for growth

00:37:34.010 --> 00:37:34.920
in an artist's career,

00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:39.790
our customers are
depending on consistency.

00:37:42.870 --> 00:37:49.190
Where artists seek
the unexpected,

00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:52.010
our customers don't tend

00:37:52.010 --> 00:37:54.180
to appreciate surprises
in the same way.

00:37:54.180 --> 00:38:01.310
So our task is to work enough
within systems and the markets

00:38:01.310 --> 00:38:04.790
that encourage entrepreneurship
in the arts all while continuing

00:38:04.790 --> 00:38:07.950
to support individual artists
to do what they do best.

00:38:07.950 --> 00:38:11.520
We are fully aware that our job
is not to convert the masses

00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:14.600
into art supporters,
but we are also aware

00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:18.110
that even art consumers
live in the same world

00:38:18.110 --> 00:38:22.090
that covets convenience,
and we would be foolish

00:38:22.090 --> 00:38:24.520
to ignore the opportunities

00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:27.730
that the Internet has
provided to small businesses.

00:38:27.730 --> 00:38:30.420
Whether that means we have to
tweak the online platform we use

00:38:30.420 --> 00:38:32.640
to make it work for original art

00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:36.320
or repackage a traditional
concept for our clients,

00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:38.670
Gather is a matchmaker
between the arts

00:38:38.670 --> 00:38:40.280
and the rest of the world.

00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:43.220
Our hope is that
with time and effort,

00:38:43.220 --> 00:38:44.980
the systems will be more willing

00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:48.010
to accommodate a different
version of productivity

00:38:48.010 --> 00:38:51.340

by individual artists.

Chase, you're up.

00:39:09.170 --> 00:39:13.590

couple very basic ones.

Maybe you can skip
to the next one.

Or I'll do that one and then
go ahead and play this video.

reel of what I do.

So I'm guessing that
by watching that,

00:40:41.500 --> 00:40:43.590
you actually have
no clue what I do.

00:40:43.590 --> 00:40:47.030
And that's sort of
my point actually.

00:40:47.030 --> 00:40:49.660
This is the classic
five paragraph essay

00:40:49.660 --> 00:40:50.770
that you learned to
write in college.

00:40:50.770 --> 00:40:52.020
I'm going to tell you what
I'm going to tell you,

00:40:52.020 --> 00:40:53.890
and then I'm going to tell you
three things, and then I'm going

00:40:53.890 --> 00:40:55.020
to tell you what I told you.

00:40:55.020 --> 00:40:58.670
So the first thing is that
my goal here is to share

00:40:58.670 --> 00:41:01.570
with you all what is
happening on the streets.

00:41:01.570 --> 00:41:06.290
We represent a vast sort of
different spectrum of creators.

00:41:06.290 --> 00:41:09.830
And it's my hope to come to
Washington and share a message

00:41:09.830 --> 00:41:13.300
that the world, the
laws, have to sort

00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:15.730
of be consistently evolving.

00:41:15.730 --> 00:41:18.530
So the point one here is
that we are all hyphens.

00:41:18.530 --> 00:41:22.010
I started out -- first of
all, I dropped out of --

00:41:22.010 --> 00:41:24.360
well, I bailed on a career
in professional soccer,

00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:25.550
bailed on medical school,

00:41:25.550 --> 00:41:28.070
and dropped out of a
Ph.D. in Philosophy.

00:41:28.070 --> 00:41:28.910
My poor parents.

00:41:28.910 --> 00:41:32.170
Right? In order to
become a photographer.

00:41:32.170 --> 00:41:36.810
That's very strange for
the people in my family.

00:41:36.810 --> 00:41:40.760
But I was a photographer,
and then I figured out how

00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:43.180
to be a photographer, and then
I figured out how to make money.

00:41:43.180 --> 00:41:44.790
So I became sort of
a business person.

00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:46.340
And then I became a director.

00:41:46.340 --> 00:41:48.380
I started directing
videos and short films

00:41:48.380 --> 00:41:49.780
and television commercials.

00:41:49.780 --> 00:41:51.860
And then I was a guest speaker.

00:41:51.860 --> 00:41:53.690
I keynoted all over the world,

00:41:53.690 --> 00:41:55.800
and then I was the
author of three books.

00:41:55.800 --> 00:42:00.490
In 2009, I created
the first iPhone app

00:42:00.490 --> 00:42:03.190
that shared photos
to social networks.

00:42:03.190 --> 00:42:05.690
So it was pre-Instagram.

00:42:05.690 --> 00:42:07.500
We had millions of users.

00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:09.170
And it fundamentally helped

00:42:09.170 --> 00:42:13.360
to shape the photo-sharing
economy that you know today.

00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:14.790
Now, that was by a photographer.

00:42:14.790 --> 00:42:17.380
My photo studio became
a little incubator.

00:42:17.380 --> 00:42:19.790
Again, millions of
downloads all over the world,

00:42:19.790 --> 00:42:23.210
and that was the App
of the Year in 2009.

00:42:23.210 --> 00:42:25.200
That is a fundamental
sort of shift.

00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:28.510
So I was a software
developer then.

00:42:28.510 --> 00:42:30.740
And that helped me
understand how technology

00:42:30.740 --> 00:42:32.580
and creativity can
work together.

00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:35.580
So in 2010, we spawned
this little company called

00:42:35.580 --> 00:42:38.330
CreativeLive out of a room that
was a third the size of this

00:42:38.330 --> 00:42:41.940
with the goal of educating
the world's creators.

00:42:41.940 --> 00:42:45.230
So I took an audience of a
million people that I had built

00:42:45.230 --> 00:42:49.390
over the course of five years
and put them in connection

00:42:49.390 --> 00:42:52.640
with my peers, who are the
best photographic, design,

00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:53.930
music educators in the world,

00:42:53.930 --> 00:42:55.410
and that company is
called CreativeLive.

00:42:55.410 --> 00:42:58.960
Our first class had
50,000 people in it.

00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:00.180
And today, we're the largest,

00:43:00.180 --> 00:43:02.010

company in the world.

00:43:02.010 --> 00:43:04.790
We reach millions of
creators all over the world.

00:43:04.790 --> 00:43:06.710
We've raised about $40 million.

00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:08.710
We've had more than
two billion minutes

00:43:08.710 --> 00:43:11.390
of creative education
consumed on a video platform.

00:43:11.390 --> 00:43:12.620

And we teach people real
business skills too,

which is something that
art school does not do.

00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:34.890

Richard Branson, Jared Leto.

going to surprise her

riskiest part of all.

prepared to do today,

are working these days.

ways that we're working.

So in, say, a film production,

00:47:25.850 --> 00:47:29.770
those schedules are
weeks, months, years.

Now you can be saying -- that's
just -- this is just child play.

00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:45.200
Snapchat is a thing that
my 14-year-old uses.

00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:48.120
I could get paid a
lot of money for this.

00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:49.150
And people do.

00:47:49.150 --> 00:47:51.850
10, 20, 25 grand.

00:47:51.850 --> 00:47:53.590
I don't think there's
a person in this room

00:47:53.590 --> 00:47:56.230
who wouldn't want 25 grand
for creating the thing

00:47:56.230 --> 00:47:58.190
that we just created together.

00:47:58.190 --> 00:48:01.220
So my point is that
things are different.

00:48:01.220 --> 00:48:05.410
And we need laws, and we need
mentality that can address it.

00:48:05.410 --> 00:48:06.970
So that's point two.

00:48:06.970 --> 00:48:11.120
And point three is that
we all have real reach.

00:48:11.120 --> 00:48:14.990
I'm going to push that thing
out, whether you like it or not,

00:48:14.990 --> 00:48:17.080
to two million people.

00:48:21.840 --> 00:48:23.380
The irony is not lost on me.

00:48:23.380 --> 00:48:25.480
It is absolutely a point
that I'm trying to make.

00:48:25.480 --> 00:48:31.270
I had the good fortune of being
at the White House yesterday --

00:48:31.270 --> 00:48:34.360
last week with President Biden.

00:48:34.360 --> 00:48:38.210
And he hosted -- sorry,
Vice President Biden, yeah.

00:48:38.210 --> 00:48:39.270
He won't mind.

00:48:39.270 --> 00:48:41.750
Obama doesn't care
about that stuff.

00:48:41.750 --> 00:48:43.860
Regardless of what side
of the aisle you're on,

00:48:43.860 --> 00:48:46.550
I had the good fortune of
being with Vice President Biden

00:48:46.550 --> 00:48:51.020
and some other influencers,
whatever that term mean.

00:48:51.020 --> 00:48:53.780
And they were YouTube
influencers,

00:48:53.780 --> 00:48:56.730
and Biden made a
really important point.

00:48:56.730 --> 00:48:59.480
And that point was,
hey, a couple weeks ago,

00:48:59.480 --> 00:49:02.070
I was at the Oscars,
and I made a speech

00:49:02.070 --> 00:49:07.620
about the campaign called
"It's On Us," ending assault

00:49:07.620 --> 00:49:10.950
on women and vulnerable men.

00:49:10.950 --> 00:49:14.860
And it's a very powerful
campaign that I'm very proud

00:49:14.860 --> 00:49:17.640
to be a part of, but he said
something to the eight of us,

00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:19.980
it was really -- it struck me.

00:49:19.980 --> 00:49:22.970
It was like, "I was on Oscars,
and the reach of that is

00:49:22.970 --> 00:49:25.790
about 30 million people."

00:49:25.790 --> 00:49:27.800
The audience that we
have collected here

00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:30.680
in this room today, the eight
of you, you have a reach

00:49:30.680 --> 00:49:35.350
of 40 million people
on a daily basis.

00:49:35.350 --> 00:49:39.010
So what we are doing is
we are sharing at scale,

00:49:39.010 --> 00:49:44.720
without permission, differently,
faster, I would say,

00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:47.890
more effectively,
than ever before.

00:49:47.890 --> 00:49:50.220
So, I promised a
five paragraph essay.

00:49:50.220 --> 00:49:51.120
I told you what I was
going to tell you.

00:49:51.120 --> 00:49:54.550
I'm telling you these three
points, and now I'm very,

00:49:54.550 --> 00:49:56.780
very excited to sit down
here and talk with my sort

00:49:56.780 --> 00:50:00.720
of esteemed colleagues about
what the future of creativity,

00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:02.520
specifically, digital
creativity,

00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:04.390
means and how it's different.

00:50:04.390 --> 00:50:05.570
I appreciate your time.

00:50:05.570 --> 00:50:07.700
I'm Chase, and I
just hit my mic.

00:50:07.700 --> 00:50:09.910
I'm going to do it one more
time because it's cool,

00:50:09.910 --> 00:50:14.180
and so remember, it's different,
it's faster, and we need laws

00:50:14.180 --> 00:50:16.350
and mentality to address it.

00:50:16.350 --> 00:50:17.510
Thank you.

00:50:17.510 --> 00:50:24.380
[ Applause ]

00:50:24.380 --> 00:50:25.310
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Chase.

00:50:25.310 --> 00:50:26.500
And thank you everyone else.

00:50:26.500 --> 00:50:28.300
Those were great presentations.

00:50:28.300 --> 00:50:32.490
So I want to start with asking
you guys the same question,

00:50:32.490 --> 00:50:34.630
and then we'll move to
the individual questions.

00:50:34.630 --> 00:50:35.910
And so my first question is -

00:50:35.910 --> 00:50:38.970
I just want to give the audience
some background information

00:50:38.970 --> 00:50:39.920
about you.

00:50:39.920 --> 00:50:42.030
And could you tell
everybody what is it

00:50:42.030 --> 00:50:44.110
that brought you to the arts?

00:50:44.110 --> 00:50:48.130
And I'd like to start with Anna.

00:50:48.130 --> 00:50:52.720
&gt;&gt; Gosh, I actually didn't
consider myself an artist

00:50:52.720 --> 00:50:54.070
for a really long time.

00:50:54.070 --> 00:50:57.550
There is something intimidating
about calling myself an artist.

00:50:57.550 --> 00:51:00.780
And I think it was probably
when I went to graduate school

00:51:00.780 --> 00:51:03.520
to get my Masters of
Fine Art that I decided

00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:04.960
to call myself an artist.

00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:06.160
But I think ultimately,

00:51:06.160 --> 00:51:09.440
it wasn't even a
choice that I made.

00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:14.380
It was simply making
the inevitable choice

00:51:14.380 --> 00:51:18.430
and material -- I'm a
ceramic artist, and so,

00:51:18.430 --> 00:51:23.340
getting my hands actually in
material, transforming material,

00:51:23.340 --> 00:51:29.060
fire, and food -- those kinds of
things have always compelled me,

00:51:29.060 --> 00:51:32.060
and I think, will
probably continue

00:51:32.060 --> 00:51:35.540
to compel not only
the work that I make

00:51:35.540 --> 00:51:37.770
but then also how I
connect with communities,

00:51:37.770 --> 00:51:42.320
which I think is truly
what now compels me

00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:46.000
about being an artist,
which is communicating

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:49.840
and effectively giving voice
to a lot of different people.

00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:51.530
&gt;&gt; Great, thanks.

00:51:51.530 --> 00:51:52.050
Chase?

00:51:52.050 --> 00:51:54.340
&gt;&gt; I'd love -- I'll
reference two words,

00:51:54.340 --> 00:51:55.810
sort of community and voice.

00:51:55.810 --> 00:51:56.970
That was really important to me.

00:51:56.970 --> 00:51:59.600
I felt a dramatic pressure,

00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:02.480
and I don't think it
was family specific.

00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:06.490
Maybe a little bit, but when
I was growing up, it was -

00:52:06.490 --> 00:52:09.970
"the creative kid"
was a weird moniker.

00:52:09.970 --> 00:52:11.100
And so I ran the other way.

00:52:11.100 --> 00:52:12.590
I became the captain
of the football team

00:52:12.590 --> 00:52:14.030
because I wanted
to sort of fit in.

00:52:14.030 --> 00:52:16.630
I ended up going to college
on a soccer scholarship,

00:52:16.630 --> 00:52:23.000
but my whole sort of being was
in conflict, and ultimately,

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:27.410
the ability to create
something is a thing

00:52:27.410 --> 00:52:28.650
that is uniquely human.

00:52:28.650 --> 00:52:31.800
It differentiates us from almost
every species on the planet,

00:52:31.800 --> 00:52:34.220
the ability to have a voice
for underserved community,

00:52:34.220 --> 00:52:36.580
for connection, for empathy.

00:52:36.580 --> 00:52:40.970
To me, that was something that
if I could figure out a way

00:52:40.970 --> 00:52:44.960
to get paid would make
this a life worth living.

00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:47.090
I think again I referenced
earlier people saying

00:52:47.090 --> 00:52:49.130
in this room that they don't
think of themselves as creative.

00:52:49.130 --> 00:52:52.510
Everything in this room -- it's
a pretty beige room honestly -

00:52:52.510 --> 00:52:56.750
but was created by no
one who was no smarter

00:52:56.750 --> 00:52:59.620
or no creative than anyone else.

00:52:59.620 --> 00:53:02.190
It's really about
unlocking that creativity.

00:53:02.190 --> 00:53:06.720
And if I could play a role in
that for myself and ultimately,

00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:08.570
I've learned later in my
career, that's what I want to do

00:53:08.570 --> 00:53:12.150
for others, that it would
be a life well lived.

00:53:12.150 --> 00:53:15.660
So it's sort of a calling but
more than anything, an awareness

00:53:15.660 --> 00:53:18.950
that this is one of
the reasons we're here.

00:53:18.950 --> 00:53:21.530
&gt;&gt; Great. Jared, what
brought you to the arts?

00:53:21.530 --> 00:53:25.870
&gt;&gt; I was really fortunate
enough to grow up in New York,

00:53:25.870 --> 00:53:31.800
and my parents took me to live
Broadway shows when I was a kid.

00:53:31.800 --> 00:53:36.210
And being in the audience
and being in the same room

00:53:36.210 --> 00:53:39.260
with the audience and the
performers at the same time

00:53:39.260 --> 00:53:42.820
and feeling what they're
feeling at the same time,

00:53:42.820 --> 00:53:46.560
it felt like I was a part
of it, because I felt

00:53:46.560 --> 00:53:50.320
like if I wasn't here, maybe the
performance would be different.

00:53:50.320 --> 00:53:55.580
And so from the very early age
I wanted to always be a part

00:53:55.580 --> 00:54:02.070
of that feeling, being a
part of sharing ideas and art

00:54:02.070 --> 00:54:05.220
in such a visceral
and immediate way.

00:54:05.220 --> 00:54:09.950
And I started working
out in theater.

00:54:09.950 --> 00:54:13.640
I worked off Broadway
shows as a --

00:54:13.640 --> 00:54:17.260
doing anything that I could
do just to be a part of it.

00:54:17.260 --> 00:54:21.380
And I worked as a P.A.,
and then a stage manager,

00:54:21.380 --> 00:54:24.730
and then I just started
producing my own shows,

00:54:24.730 --> 00:54:29.900
and so yeah, and I think that
actually having a background

00:54:29.900 --> 00:54:33.730
with live and experiencing
things live

00:54:33.730 --> 00:54:36.780
and immediately really
speaks to what we're talking

00:54:36.780 --> 00:54:40.240
about here today with
the digital format

00:54:40.240 --> 00:54:42.430
because what we do,
like Chase said,

00:54:42.430 --> 00:54:45.480
he's going to push this out,
something that we made together

00:54:45.480 --> 00:54:49.090
to two million people,
and that's exciting.

00:54:49.090 --> 00:54:55.180
And the fact that we can share
that together is inspiring

00:54:55.180 --> 00:54:56.810
and really exciting to me.

00:54:56.810 --> 00:54:59.380
&gt;&gt; Great. So the rest of
my questions are aimed

00:54:59.380 --> 00:55:02.920
at one particular person, but
if the other panelists want

00:55:02.920 --> 00:55:05.030
to jump in, feel free.

00:55:05.030 --> 00:55:07.420
So, Chase, I'm going
to start with you.

00:55:07.420 --> 00:55:11.260
You created an online classroom,
bringing together creators

00:55:11.260 --> 00:55:14.420
with the world's top
experts in their fields.

00:55:14.420 --> 00:55:17.540
And what is it about the current
creative economy that led you

00:55:17.540 --> 00:55:20.340
to develop this dynamic website?

00:55:20.340 --> 00:55:20.760
&gt;&gt; Oh, man.

00:55:20.760 --> 00:55:24.460
There's a -- it's a
convergence of many things.

00:55:24.460 --> 00:55:27.750
I like the question
because it addresses a --

00:55:27.750 --> 00:55:33.160
what I think that is there's
a real need and a vacancy,

00:55:33.160 --> 00:55:36.320
that we value creativity.

00:55:36.320 --> 00:55:39.990
Look at all of the
industry around creativity.

00:55:39.990 --> 00:55:41.000
As I mentioned earlier,

00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:44.060
everything in your
world was designed.

00:55:44.060 --> 00:55:45.160
It was first concepted

00:55:45.160 --> 00:55:48.700
by an artist before
it was manufactured.

00:55:48.700 --> 00:55:51.000
And there's a real
disconnect between --

00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:54.300
we throw around words like
innovation and creativity,

00:55:54.300 --> 00:55:55.860
but we don't know
what that means,

00:55:55.860 --> 00:55:57.130
and we don't know
where it comes from.

00:55:57.130 --> 00:56:00.650
Well, it comes from
fostering and nurturing that.

00:56:00.650 --> 00:56:05.860
And we can't have a culture
that values it, but a system

00:56:05.860 --> 00:56:08.470
that doesn't provide for
it, which is currently --

00:56:08.470 --> 00:56:12.130
the education system is very,
very broken in our country.

00:56:12.130 --> 00:56:16.520
One of the first things to
get cut, the arts programs.

00:56:16.520 --> 00:56:20.480
And so, I recognize
that, and with a bunch --

00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:23.130
to be crystal clear, it's myself
plus it's a hundred other people

00:56:23.130 --> 00:56:25.920
who go to work at CreativeLive
every day with the vision

00:56:25.920 --> 00:56:28.620
of helping people
live that life.

00:56:28.620 --> 00:56:33.650
And there's another disconnect
around sort of the ability

00:56:33.650 --> 00:56:36.420
to make a living and
a life as a creative.

00:56:36.420 --> 00:56:38.640
We talked about this
last night at the bar.

00:56:38.640 --> 00:56:43.000
I don't know if I'm
supposed to say that.

00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:47.160
And it's -- art school
currently does not create --

00:56:47.160 --> 00:56:50.560
there's no part of the
curricula that has anything

00:56:50.560 --> 00:56:52.400
to do with the business.

00:56:52.400 --> 00:56:56.170
And so at CreativeLive, we
wanted to connect millions

00:56:56.170 --> 00:56:58.350
of creators all over the
world who are interested --

00:56:58.350 --> 00:57:00.330
and these are people who
are going not just from one

00:57:00.330 --> 00:57:01.300
to ten in their career.

00:57:01.300 --> 00:57:03.110
They're already identified
as a creative,

00:57:03.110 --> 00:57:04.950
and they're becoming
more creative,

00:57:04.950 --> 00:57:07.660
or they're having a
more successful career,

00:57:07.660 --> 00:57:10.520
but these are also people who
are going from zero to one.

00:57:10.520 --> 00:57:13.240
These are people who
are working at Amazon

00:57:13.240 --> 00:57:15.570
or in an accounting firm,

00:57:15.570 --> 00:57:16.850
and they've been
told their whole life

00:57:16.850 --> 00:57:17.560
that they weren't creative.

00:57:17.560 --> 00:57:18.720
My Mom is a great example.

00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:20.680
Told her whole life
she wasn't creative

00:57:20.680 --> 00:57:22.610
and then I gave her an iPhone,

00:57:22.610 --> 00:57:24.880
and with that little
app I created in 2009,

00:57:24.880 --> 00:57:28.000
and she went instantly from
being not recognized as creative

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:30.490
to the most creative
of all her friends.

00:57:30.490 --> 00:57:32.910
"Joy, your pictures
are incredible."

00:57:32.910 --> 00:57:37.250
Now, those two communities
are both underserved.

00:57:37.250 --> 00:57:41.300
So by creating CreativeLive,
we were hoping to sort

00:57:41.300 --> 00:57:44.110
of support that, support the
areas, the gaps in our culture

00:57:44.110 --> 00:57:47.460
that were missing at this
point, and teach them how

00:57:47.460 --> 00:57:49.880
to make a living and
a life from people

00:57:49.880 --> 00:57:51.210
who are actually doing it.

00:57:51.210 --> 00:57:53.820
This is not an academic
institution.

00:57:53.820 --> 00:57:57.570
It is very much a practical,
hands-on, skill-based learning.

00:57:57.570 --> 00:58:00.750
And when you have instructors,
who are world-class experts,

00:58:00.750 --> 00:58:02.590
and I'm talking -- I mean,
you saw the list of names:

00:58:02.590 --> 00:58:05.340
Pulitzer Prize winners, New
York Times best-selling authors,

00:58:05.340 --> 00:58:07.540
Grammy award winners,
Oscar award winners.

00:58:07.540 --> 00:58:08.830
These are people
that are coming back

00:58:08.830 --> 00:58:10.190
and giving back to
their community.

00:58:10.190 --> 00:58:13.590
They're also getting
compensated, but to me,

00:58:13.590 --> 00:58:16.110
that's a gap in the
sort of marketplace

00:58:16.110 --> 00:58:22.940
and intellectual cultural
space that we needed to fill.

00:58:22.940 --> 00:58:24.610
&gt;&gt; Great, thank you.

00:58:24.610 --> 00:58:25.720
Jared, some other questions.

00:58:25.720 --> 00:58:27.850
So what first sparked
your decision

00:58:27.850 --> 00:58:31.690
to explore online collaboration
and use digital tools

00:58:31.690 --> 00:58:35.470
to create and distribute works?

00:58:35.470 --> 00:58:36.520
&gt;&gt; It's funny.

00:58:36.520 --> 00:58:40.900
There was no decision really.

00:58:40.900 --> 00:58:44.230
This was something that,
especially for me, well, for me,

00:58:44.230 --> 00:58:45.420
personally, was something

00:58:45.420 --> 00:58:48.730
that just happened
pretty organically.

00:58:48.730 --> 00:58:54.320
Like I said, I have a background
in live shows and live art.

00:58:54.320 --> 00:58:58.500
And I had worked on a play
with Joe Gordon-Levitt.

00:58:58.500 --> 00:59:03.370
And I think it was about ten
years ago, he put this --

00:59:03.370 --> 00:59:04.660
this is before YouTube.

00:59:04.660 --> 00:59:07.440
So, I guess, it was
more like 11 years ago.

00:59:07.440 --> 00:59:11.390
He put up an online
journal called HITRECORD

00:59:11.390 --> 00:59:15.120
where he thought, "A lot of
people know me as an actor,

00:59:15.120 --> 00:59:16.190
but they don't know
me as a writer.

00:59:16.190 --> 00:59:17.870
They don't know me
as a musician."

00:59:17.870 --> 00:59:22.160
And so he put up a journal,
a blog that would --

00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:26.670
he would put up writing, and he
would put up video and music,

00:59:26.670 --> 00:59:28.170
and people would download it.

00:59:28.170 --> 00:59:30.600
This is before click-to-play
video.

00:59:30.600 --> 00:59:34.030
And a community started
to crop up.

00:59:34.030 --> 00:59:38.520
People were writing to him what
they thought about his art,

00:59:38.520 --> 00:59:41.560
and then it became a little
bit more of a dialogue,

00:59:41.560 --> 00:59:45.590
and Joe would respond to
what people were saying.

00:59:45.590 --> 00:59:50.330
And then I remember he made a
very crucial decision as to:

00:59:50.330 --> 00:59:51.790
do we put up a message board?

00:59:51.790 --> 00:59:57.150
Do we put up a message board so
people can talk more, faster,

00:59:57.150 --> 01:00:02.040
and the dialogue can
just get more specific?

01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:05.710
And it was a big decision, and
he put up this message board.

01:00:05.710 --> 01:00:11.800
And what we -- what started
happening almost instantaneously

01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:15.070
was not, "Hey, I'm going
to put this thing up,

01:00:15.070 --> 01:00:16.500
and then you respond to it."

01:00:16.500 --> 01:00:19.200
It was -- there was a natural
progression that people wanted

01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:21.790
to start creating together.

01:00:21.790 --> 01:00:26.060
And on this message board
with just a few hundred people

01:00:26.060 --> 01:00:30.400
at the start, the very first
collaboration that we had

01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:33.980
or that was up on the message
board was a word association

01:00:33.980 --> 01:00:35.800
game where somebody
would say a word

01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:37.600
and then another person
would say the first thing

01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:39.290
that popped to mind.

01:00:39.290 --> 01:00:42.860
And then that evolved into
thousands and thousands

01:00:42.860 --> 01:00:44.470
of words, and then
somebody had the idea,

01:00:44.470 --> 01:00:47.340
"Let's take all these words
and make a story out of it."

01:00:47.340 --> 01:00:50.910
And so I think people
have the natural tendency

01:00:50.910 --> 01:00:52.970
to want to create together.

01:00:52.970 --> 01:00:57.430
And after more and more of
these threads with different --

01:00:57.430 --> 01:01:00.670
there was a writing
collaboration

01:01:00.670 --> 01:01:03.090
and a music collaboration
and a video collaboration --

01:01:03.090 --> 01:01:07.650
we started talking
and said, there's --

01:01:07.650 --> 01:01:09.130
people want to do this.

01:01:09.130 --> 01:01:12.180
Let's provide a --
we've got to create --

01:01:12.180 --> 01:01:14.340
we're developing this
creative community

01:01:14.340 --> 01:01:17.860
and sometimes providing
some creative direction.

01:01:17.860 --> 01:01:20.830
How can we really make --

01:01:20.830 --> 01:01:27.620
turn this into something where
we're making real productions,

01:01:27.620 --> 01:01:28.890
authoring in terms of service,

01:01:28.890 --> 01:01:31.190
making it legal and
paying people?

01:01:31.190 --> 01:01:35.520
And that's what we did,
and starting in 2009,

01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:38.950
we started building
the tech infrastructure

01:01:38.950 --> 01:01:41.480
and the legal infrastructure
to do that.

01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:44.560
So, I mean, just to answer
your question more succinctly,

01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:48.010
it wasn't a decision as much as
it was a natural progression.

01:01:48.010 --> 01:01:53.790
And I think that's what makes
our community so special is

01:01:53.790 --> 01:01:57.020
that it wasn't -- it's
not a marketing campaign.

01:01:57.020 --> 01:01:59.290
It's not something
that we forced.

01:01:59.290 --> 01:02:02.620
If you were to say how do
you make an online community,

01:02:02.620 --> 01:02:05.660
I wouldn't be able to answer it.

01:02:05.660 --> 01:02:07.280
But yeah.

01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:08.740
&gt;&gt; Great, thanks.

01:02:08.740 --> 01:02:12.130
Anna, so what are some of
the challenges that you faced

01:02:12.130 --> 01:02:14.600
when trying to connect
with your audiences?

01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:16.660
People looking for
wedding gifts,

01:02:16.660 --> 01:02:18.860
but they've never
heard of Gather?

01:02:18.860 --> 01:02:22.700
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, I think it's
kind of a two part answer.

01:02:22.700 --> 01:02:28.610
One is it boils down to sort
of straight up marketing

01:02:28.610 --> 01:02:31.850
and the ability to just get
a product out into the world.

01:02:31.850 --> 01:02:35.980
We have lots of mechanisms
to do that.

01:02:35.980 --> 01:02:40.720
Right now, I think
the most exciting part

01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:43.430
about our business model
and the way that we do it is

01:02:43.430 --> 01:02:46.580
that there's this whole industry

01:02:46.580 --> 01:02:49.830
where people get
hitched all the time.

01:02:49.830 --> 01:02:54.910
And there's a gift economy
associated with getting married.

01:02:54.910 --> 01:02:58.660
And so when two people decide
they're going to do that,

01:02:58.660 --> 01:03:05.530
they send out our information,
as any kind of wedding registry

01:03:05.530 --> 01:03:11.630
or any kind of ecommerce
platform at this point, to 250,

01:03:11.630 --> 01:03:13.370
300 of their favorite friends.

01:03:13.370 --> 01:03:17.310
And so those people are really
doing our marketing for us,

01:03:17.310 --> 01:03:20.660
which is actually
kind of a cool thing.

01:03:20.660 --> 01:03:26.810
I think -- and so I think our
challenge is to get the interest

01:03:26.810 --> 01:03:32.350
of that original couple, the
sort of -- our original client,

01:03:32.350 --> 01:03:36.010
if you will, and one of the
things that is really exciting

01:03:36.010 --> 01:03:39.080
about that is that they
tend to be younger,

01:03:39.080 --> 01:03:40.950
and they tend to be interested.

01:03:40.950 --> 01:03:44.200
They have all of the towels and
the toasters that they need.

01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:45.870
And so they tend
to be interested

01:03:45.870 --> 01:03:51.090
in doing something unique
and so when we intersect

01:03:51.090 --> 01:03:54.690
with those couples, the
people who are interested

01:03:54.690 --> 01:03:58.610
in registering with Gather
or anybody who's interested

01:03:58.610 --> 01:04:02.100
in setting up a gift registry
for that matter, it's a matter

01:04:02.100 --> 01:04:04.510
of communication, and I
think that's the second part

01:04:04.510 --> 01:04:09.550
of it is how do we effectively
talk about value and curation?

01:04:09.550 --> 01:04:14.500
What is it that makes the artist
that we represent excellent?

01:04:14.500 --> 01:04:17.860
I think the idea of excellence
is something that we --

01:04:17.860 --> 01:04:20.110
is a conversation
that is evolving

01:04:20.110 --> 01:04:23.500
as we put our work
out into the world.

01:04:23.500 --> 01:04:26.560
How do we curate and how do
we consider different works

01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:29.040
of art to be excellent?

01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:34.410
And we really work hard on
trying to communicate that gap

01:04:34.410 --> 01:04:37.480
between what are the --

01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:43.030
I have this user experience
when I go into Macy's online.

01:04:43.030 --> 01:04:44.990
I'm going to pick on Macy's.

01:04:44.990 --> 01:04:46.840
Their online registry page.

01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:50.480
I feel like that's the kind of
user experience I want to have,

01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:52.940
and so does that --
can that translate

01:04:52.940 --> 01:04:58.240
into bringing the fine
art object to my life?

01:04:58.240 --> 01:05:01.100
And our task is to
say yes, it is.

01:05:01.100 --> 01:05:02.730
There are some things we
have to negotiate, but --

01:05:02.730 --> 01:05:07.300
and effectively communicating
those differences is really kind

01:05:07.300 --> 01:05:08.560
of our challenge.

01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:09.320
Yeah.

01:05:09.320 --> 01:05:11.140
&gt;&gt; All right, thanks.

01:05:11.140 --> 01:05:13.470
Chase, there's a lot of
talk in the arts community

01:05:13.470 --> 01:05:17.550
about finding ways to support
artist-centered technologies.

01:05:17.550 --> 01:05:20.520
What's the value in artists
developing their own online

01:05:20.520 --> 01:05:25.000
platforms to distribute
and make creative content?

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:29.640
&gt;&gt; Well, it's the first time
in the history of the world

01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:33.640
that we are not bound
by gatekeepers.

01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:37.360
We require no permission
now to share at scale.

01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:40.360
It used to be we were kept
out by the gallerists,

01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:45.720
by the photo editor,
by the art director,

01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:47.890
or the creative director
at the agency.

01:05:47.890 --> 01:05:53.900
And now with the benefits
of technology, you can reach

01:05:53.900 --> 01:05:57.490
that same scale or much greater,
as in my earlier example,

01:05:57.490 --> 01:05:58.980
at the push of a button.

01:05:58.980 --> 01:06:03.920
So what that creates is in
many ways a sense of freedom.

01:06:03.920 --> 01:06:09.180
And the technology -- the sort
of technology community --

01:06:09.180 --> 01:06:11.360
I don't want to put
crosshairs on their back.

01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:15.270
I think Joe is wise to point
out that Google and Facebook

01:06:15.270 --> 01:06:19.380
and others are making billions,
hundreds of billions of dollars.

01:06:19.380 --> 01:06:24.330
But the message isn't
that they should not exist

01:06:24.330 --> 01:06:26.800
or that we should
continue on the paradigm.

01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:31.740
It is a very, very dynamic
and complicated thing.

01:06:31.740 --> 01:06:35.330
For me, technology
literally created my career.

01:06:35.330 --> 01:06:37.200
I was a very sexy?

01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:39.160
I was a very sexy photographer.

01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:44.720
I was a very successful
photographer pre-internet

01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:48.640
because I learned the
value of my work early,

01:06:48.640 --> 01:06:50.030
and that was out of necessity.

01:06:50.030 --> 01:06:52.030
I needed to eat.

01:06:52.030 --> 01:06:53.630
I needed to put food
on the table

01:06:53.630 --> 01:06:56.490
so I'm not naturally
gifted in business.

01:06:56.490 --> 01:06:58.200
I had to become that.

01:06:58.200 --> 01:07:01.850
And I was very happy
with my career and then

01:07:01.850 --> 01:07:05.350
in a pre-YouTube -- it was
called Google Video at the time,

01:07:05.350 --> 01:07:09.230
where you could put up videos,
I started telling the story

01:07:09.230 --> 01:07:11.380
of what I call the black
box of photography.

01:07:11.380 --> 01:07:15.810
It was a very closed
world, and if you were

01:07:15.810 --> 01:07:20.120
out there sharing a point
of view, you were sort of --

01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:23.140
the industry or the people that
were comprised of the leaders

01:07:23.140 --> 01:07:25.970
in the industry were
very upset with you.

01:07:25.970 --> 01:07:29.750
I was vilified, in fact,
for sharing the first videos

01:07:29.750 --> 01:07:32.060
that I was -- about what it
was like to go on location.

01:07:32.060 --> 01:07:35.350
It doesn't matter -- I
was shooting for the Nikes

01:07:35.350 --> 01:07:40.850
and the Apples and Fortune 100
brands, and telling the story

01:07:40.850 --> 01:07:45.000
about what it was like to
do that, effectively opening

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:46.530
up this sort of black box,

01:07:46.530 --> 01:07:49.660
and sharing secrets was
a very risky proposition,

01:07:49.660 --> 01:07:52.290
and you might be sitting in
the audience judging, thinking,

01:07:52.290 --> 01:07:54.060
"Well, geez, why aren't
you undermining your

01:07:54.060 --> 01:07:55.350
own livelihood?"

01:07:55.350 --> 01:07:57.510
But the reality is
that we need to --

01:07:57.510 --> 01:08:00.290
there needs to be some sort of
middle ground between pretending

01:08:00.290 --> 01:08:03.360
that that doesn't exist, a
head in the sand mentality,

01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:04.350
and acknowledging

01:08:04.350 --> 01:08:07.330
that information is moving
faster than ever before.

01:08:07.330 --> 01:08:12.330
So it was my very proactive
decision to sort of open that up

01:08:12.330 --> 01:08:14.280
and to help other
people become --

01:08:14.280 --> 01:08:17.000
I wanted to take a world of
just millions of photographers

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:20.350
and make it into a world of
billions of photographers.

01:08:20.350 --> 01:08:24.100
And make the image more
popular than the word.

01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:27.680
And that again may
be controversial,

01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:31.940
but that enabled -- that was
only enabled through technology.

01:08:31.940 --> 01:08:35.890
And my career was able to
grow very, very quickly

01:08:35.890 --> 01:08:39.730
when that sort of
paradigm flipped

01:08:39.730 --> 01:08:41.420
because no one was
using the medium.

01:08:41.420 --> 01:08:43.670
So I sort of stepped
into a vacuum.

01:08:43.670 --> 01:08:45.500
And this isn't just about me.

01:08:45.500 --> 01:08:47.480
This is about so
many of the other --

01:08:47.480 --> 01:08:49.990
I will call them thousands
if not millions of creators

01:08:49.990 --> 01:08:51.870
who have been able
to now make a living.

01:08:51.870 --> 01:08:53.620
I mentioned earlier
that there are people

01:08:53.620 --> 01:08:56.100
who will pay 20 thousand
bucks for the little video

01:08:56.100 --> 01:08:57.200
that we made right there.

01:08:57.200 --> 01:08:59.520
Maybe not that one because that
was pretty boring honestly.

01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:03.890
But the point is that
there is a new economy,

01:09:03.890 --> 01:09:06.600
and we are experiencing
seismic shifts

01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:09.810
in how the technology world

01:09:09.810 --> 01:09:12.210
and the creative
world are interacting.

01:09:12.210 --> 01:09:16.530
I think it's, by and large,
up to us to define whether

01:09:16.530 --> 01:09:20.540
that will be positive or not.

01:09:20.540 --> 01:09:22.100
&gt;&gt; Great. So, Jared.

01:09:22.100 --> 01:09:25.030
Your organization is
unique to say the least.

01:09:25.030 --> 01:09:28.480
And I'm wondering why do you
use non-exclusive licenses

01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:30.950
and why do you invite
creators to the table

01:09:30.950 --> 01:09:35.040
to discuss revenue sharing?

01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:41.590
&gt;&gt; So, I think the internet
can be, probably is,

01:09:41.590 --> 01:09:46.590
a very scary place, and when --

01:09:46.590 --> 01:09:49.830
every so often when a social
network you're on, like Facebook

01:09:49.830 --> 01:09:52.370
or Instagram, updates
their terms of service

01:09:52.370 --> 01:09:58.530
and certain elements are
revealed that organizations want

01:09:58.530 --> 01:10:01.660
to make money through
your IP in certain kinds

01:10:01.660 --> 01:10:04.510
of ways, we all freak out.

01:10:04.510 --> 01:10:09.080
We're very transparent
with our --

01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:12.650
with what we're doing
at HITRECORD.

01:10:12.650 --> 01:10:16.420
It's very important to create
a really safe environment

01:10:16.420 --> 01:10:19.770
if you're going to
create art together.

01:10:19.770 --> 01:10:22.380
So we're very clear
and transparent

01:10:22.380 --> 01:10:26.660
with what it is we do and
how it is we make things.

01:10:26.660 --> 01:10:29.650
And that really -- and if
you're going to do that

01:10:29.650 --> 01:10:35.090
and you're going to have that
dialogue, it has to be fair.

01:10:35.090 --> 01:10:39.410
And we're very active
with that dialogue.

01:10:39.410 --> 01:10:43.150
In terms of non-exclusivity,
we want you to be able

01:10:43.150 --> 01:10:49.350
to use your IP to do
whatever you want to do.

01:10:49.350 --> 01:10:52.620
We don't want to own it.

01:10:52.620 --> 01:10:55.650
We don't want to
control your ideas.

01:10:55.650 --> 01:11:01.780
But we are a for-profit
organization so if we can figure

01:11:01.780 --> 01:11:05.000
out a way to make money with
your ideas in combination

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.800
with everybody else's ideas,

01:11:07.800 --> 01:11:09.660
there needs to be some
sort of agreement.

01:11:09.660 --> 01:11:11.460
And so we enter into that.

01:11:11.460 --> 01:11:14.410
And when we talk about
profit sharing, we've --

01:11:14.410 --> 01:11:16.780
as Joe mentioned in the
video -- we've paid out --

01:11:16.780 --> 01:11:19.250
at the end of this
year, it'll be closer

01:11:19.250 --> 01:11:21.570
to 2.5 million dollars.

01:11:21.570 --> 01:11:26.740
And when we were thinking of
our terms of service and laying

01:11:26.740 --> 01:11:32.060
out our monetization policy,
we wanted to make it efficient

01:11:32.060 --> 01:11:34.850
and just make a formula
or create an algorithm

01:11:34.850 --> 01:11:38.180
and just say, "All right,
that's how you get paid."

01:11:38.180 --> 01:11:40.230
But it's not -- that's
not how it works.

01:11:40.230 --> 01:11:42.260
Every piece of art is different.

01:11:42.260 --> 01:11:45.110
Every ingredient to that
piece of art is different.

01:11:45.110 --> 01:11:50.120
And how you feel about that
piece of art is different.

01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:56.520
So what we do is every pay
period, we take the money

01:11:56.520 --> 01:11:58.710
that was made for that project.

01:11:58.710 --> 01:12:03.060
We post those profits on the
site for everybody to see,

01:12:03.060 --> 01:12:05.590
and we say, "These are
all of the elements

01:12:05.590 --> 01:12:08.020
that went into this project."

01:12:08.020 --> 01:12:09.460
Whether it's a music video,

01:12:09.460 --> 01:12:11.390
whether it's a television
episode,

01:12:11.390 --> 01:12:15.530
whether it's a TV commercial,
whether it's a vinyl record.

01:12:15.530 --> 01:12:17.630
We say, "These are all the
things that went into it."

01:12:17.630 --> 01:12:23.520
And this is what we think is a
fair split amongst everybody.

01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:27.800
And the community has two weeks

01:12:27.800 --> 01:12:30.630
to have an open dialogue
about that.

01:12:30.630 --> 01:12:32.260
Now, we've been doing
it for six years.

01:12:32.260 --> 01:12:36.500
So there are pretty much --
a lot of the question marks

01:12:36.500 --> 01:12:40.790
and variables as to how this
would work in different cases,

01:12:40.790 --> 01:12:43.230
there's a precedent for it.

01:12:43.230 --> 01:12:47.080
But for two weeks, we
have an open discussion.

01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:48.760
Some people say,
"You forgot me."

01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:50.440
Or, "Maybe I should get more."

01:12:50.440 --> 01:12:54.500
Or, this person may be, "I
want to give mine to this."

01:12:54.500 --> 01:12:56.320
And we have that discussion.

01:12:56.320 --> 01:12:59.190
And at the end of two
weeks, we say, "Okay,

01:12:59.190 --> 01:13:01.010
we take that feedback
into consideration,

01:13:01.010 --> 01:13:02.250
and then we make a decision."

01:13:02.250 --> 01:13:05.450
And what we have found is
that people, of course,

01:13:05.450 --> 01:13:08.280
love getting paid and
recognized for what they do.

01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:14.120
But I should say the attribution
and the credit is almost

01:13:14.120 --> 01:13:17.710
as important, if not more
important, just that people know

01:13:17.710 --> 01:13:20.850
that they got credit for
what their contribution was.

01:13:20.850 --> 01:13:22.130
What's really great --

01:13:22.130 --> 01:13:25.430
and I think there's videos
of Joe signing checks.

01:13:25.430 --> 01:13:30.800
I mean, it's more automated
now, but it is really gratifying

01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:35.240
to have -- to see a stack of
checks go out to thousands

01:13:35.240 --> 01:13:38.180
of artists all over
the world for stuff

01:13:38.180 --> 01:13:40.840
that we've made together
and feeling good

01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:42.590
that everybody feels good.

01:13:42.590 --> 01:13:46.050
Not only about the stuff that
we've made, but about how --

01:13:46.050 --> 01:13:48.810
what they were paid
and how they were paid.

01:13:48.810 --> 01:13:49.920
&gt;&gt; Great, thanks.

01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:54.120
So, Anna, the nature of
Gather is local and intimate.

01:13:54.120 --> 01:13:57.550
And so presumably that affects
the way that you can scale.

01:13:57.550 --> 01:13:59.390
So I'm wondering, how do
you think of it as an asset

01:13:59.390 --> 01:14:00.930
and how is it a limitation?

01:14:00.930 --> 01:14:02.660
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's such
a good question.

01:14:02.660 --> 01:14:09.220
And I think we are in such
beginning stages of our business

01:14:09.220 --> 01:14:12.640
that it remains to be seen
how that's actually going

01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:13.880
to play out.

01:14:13.880 --> 01:14:17.710
But I do think that first
of all, the localness,

01:14:17.710 --> 01:14:22.620
if you want to call it that,
of Gather is truly an asset

01:14:22.620 --> 01:14:24.480
because it allows people to --

01:14:24.480 --> 01:14:26.950
and I think people
have this compulsion --

01:14:26.950 --> 01:14:30.300
I know in Minnesota this is the
case anyway, to want to dig deep

01:14:30.300 --> 01:14:34.380
into something really
close to home

01:14:34.380 --> 01:14:39.480
that when we feel really
good about spending dollars

01:14:39.480 --> 01:14:43.340
from an artist like two
blocks from our house

01:14:43.340 --> 01:14:46.390
or we feel even better
when we realize

01:14:46.390 --> 01:14:51.110
that our contribution went
to creating a commission

01:14:51.110 --> 01:14:53.470
that would never have happened

01:14:53.470 --> 01:14:56.020
without my small
little contribution

01:14:56.020 --> 01:14:57.990
from the artist in northeast.

01:14:57.990 --> 01:15:03.110
So I think there's something
really gratifying about that.

01:15:03.110 --> 01:15:07.940
I also think that it
helps really create,

01:15:07.940 --> 01:15:11.750
generate an audience
that has the capability

01:15:11.750 --> 01:15:13.870
of transforming individual
artist's lives.

01:15:13.870 --> 01:15:16.520
So that there's truly
a mechanism

01:15:16.520 --> 01:15:20.320
by which the community can
impact the continued development

01:15:20.320 --> 01:15:22.570
of a local arts economy,
which is something

01:15:22.570 --> 01:15:24.500
that we think a lot
about in Minneapolis.

01:15:24.500 --> 01:15:27.680
So I think that that
is an asset,

01:15:27.680 --> 01:15:30.680
and that's really something that
we want to promote and foster.

01:15:30.680 --> 01:15:35.640
I imagine that Gather will begin
to extend, and we already kind

01:15:35.640 --> 01:15:38.600
of do between Minnesota and
Wisconsin, that there's kind

01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:43.150
of an upper Midwestern region
that we'll be really kind

01:15:43.150 --> 01:15:44.680
of focusing on developing.

01:15:44.680 --> 01:15:48.870
And as far as scaling
beyond that, I think there's

01:15:48.870 --> 01:15:52.010
that compulsion exists
in other communities.

01:15:52.010 --> 01:15:54.950
And so the way that we
imagine expansion is

01:15:54.950 --> 01:15:58.770
to actually franchise
in kind of a weird way,

01:15:58.770 --> 01:16:03.880
but to have individual artists
and kind of groups of people

01:16:03.880 --> 01:16:06.890
to curate because I think
curation is really essentially

01:16:06.890 --> 01:16:08.070
to our process as well.

01:16:08.070 --> 01:16:14.870
But to curate a similarly
locally-based version of Gather

01:16:14.870 --> 01:16:16.460
in different corners of the U.S.

01:16:16.460 --> 01:16:18.690
So we're not sure how
that's going to happen.

01:16:18.690 --> 01:16:21.360
We're kind of like trying
to dig deep right now

01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:26.220
into the Minneapolis, St. Paul,
and bigger Minnesota market.

01:16:26.220 --> 01:16:29.780
But I think it has
a lot of potential.

01:16:29.780 --> 01:16:34.910
Like I said, people really
do like supporting local.

01:16:34.910 --> 01:16:39.280
And also being able to kind of
point at something on their wall

01:16:39.280 --> 01:16:41.940
and say, "Not only
is that a cool piece,

01:16:41.940 --> 01:16:43.260
but it's from across town.

01:16:43.260 --> 01:16:46.320
I actually met the
person that made that."

01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:49.130
And there's just like a lot
of warm fuzzies about that.

01:16:49.130 --> 01:16:51.720
So we want to continue
to promote that.

01:16:51.720 --> 01:16:54.590
&gt;&gt; Sure. All right, thanks.

01:16:54.590 --> 01:16:57.710
Chase. CreativeLive enables
revenue stream for creators

01:16:57.710 --> 01:17:01.550
who are also educators by paying
instructors to teach courses.

01:17:01.550 --> 01:17:04.290
So what philosophies do you
have in selecting and working

01:17:04.290 --> 01:17:06.450
with these instructors?

01:17:06.450 --> 01:17:08.110
&gt;&gt; I'll borrow your term.

01:17:08.110 --> 01:17:12.730
Curation. It's absolutely
critical that the people

01:17:12.730 --> 01:17:16.200
that are teaching at
CreativeLive are the best.

01:17:16.200 --> 01:17:18.600
There are many sort
of marketplaces,

01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:21.740
online education marketplaces
-- I don't need to name them.

01:17:21.740 --> 01:17:23.080
The way I describe it, though,

01:17:23.080 --> 01:17:25.560
is they're an inch
deep and a mile wide.

01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:28.570
And they really don't care
who's on their platform.

01:17:28.570 --> 01:17:34.450
It is sort of something that
was by and large created in a --

01:17:34.450 --> 01:17:36.810
I know most of these companies
very intimately and they,

01:17:36.810 --> 01:17:40.610
by and large, were created
by MBA's with business plans

01:17:40.610 --> 01:17:43.050
to scale online education.

01:17:43.050 --> 01:17:48.410
We consider ourselves very,
very focused on creativity.

01:17:48.410 --> 01:17:52.070
Photography, design, video,
music and audio, crafts,

01:17:52.070 --> 01:17:54.300
the maker movement, and the
ability to make a living

01:17:54.300 --> 01:17:55.940
and a life, and all
those things.

01:17:55.940 --> 01:17:58.130
And so for us, we want
to serve a community,

01:17:58.130 --> 01:17:59.900
a community of creators
who are going

01:17:59.900 --> 01:18:02.100
from zero to one or one to ten.

01:18:02.100 --> 01:18:08.350
And in that world, our name, our
brand, the value that we bring

01:18:08.350 --> 01:18:11.240
to our students is all we have.

01:18:11.240 --> 01:18:15.510
And so taking that
lightly would be something

01:18:15.510 --> 01:18:20.650
that I wouldn't advocate as the
founder and CEO, and deciding

01:18:20.650 --> 01:18:22.760
who gets to be the people

01:18:22.760 --> 01:18:26.270
who teach our future
artists is a thing

01:18:26.270 --> 01:18:27.460
that we don't take lightly.

01:18:27.460 --> 01:18:31.820
We take that very, very
seriously because we're trying

01:18:31.820 --> 01:18:36.080
to arm these creators with
the skills that they need

01:18:36.080 --> 01:18:37.270
to go into the future.

01:18:37.270 --> 01:18:40.640
And we're all literally
assembled here on World IP Day

01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:42.830
because the future
is so uncertain

01:18:42.830 --> 01:18:45.790
and we need the stewards
of our future to be people

01:18:45.790 --> 01:18:49.680
who are validated, who are
carefully curated to sort

01:18:49.680 --> 01:18:53.580
of help the rising tide
float all the boats.

01:18:53.580 --> 01:18:56.010
So we're meticulous about it.

01:18:56.010 --> 01:19:00.200
I wouldn't bore you with the
actual details, but it has to do

01:19:00.200 --> 01:19:05.140
with being great at what you do
and also have teaching skills.

01:19:05.140 --> 01:19:06.330
It's no different -- think

01:19:06.330 --> 01:19:09.730
of the best teachers
-- actually do this.

01:19:09.730 --> 01:19:13.020
Think of the best
teachers you ever had.

01:19:13.020 --> 01:19:15.120
They were not the smartest.

01:19:15.120 --> 01:19:20.840
They were part entertaining,
part wise, very much human,

01:19:20.840 --> 01:19:24.030
and those are the people that we
seek to bring on our platform.

01:19:24.030 --> 01:19:25.820
So it's not just the
people with the most papers.

01:19:25.820 --> 01:19:28.010
It's not the people who
have the most experience.

01:19:28.010 --> 01:19:31.800
It's the people who are
great teachers, that connect.

01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:34.660
You like to say that there's a
human being behind the pieces

01:19:34.660 --> 01:19:37.130
of art, and we want
our instructors,

01:19:37.130 --> 01:19:40.130
our experts to be world
class, to be all these things

01:19:40.130 --> 01:19:43.290
and to be able to
connect with a community.

01:19:43.290 --> 01:19:45.530
So we take that very,
very seriously,

01:19:45.530 --> 01:19:47.750
something I'm super proud of.

01:19:47.750 --> 01:19:49.190
&gt;&gt; Great, thanks.

01:19:49.190 --> 01:19:51.050
Jared, you probably
came to your project

01:19:51.050 --> 01:19:53.990
with certain goals
and philosophies.

01:19:53.990 --> 01:19:57.440
Has HITRECORD exceeded
your expectations

01:19:57.440 --> 01:20:01.460
or taught you new things
about the creative process?

01:20:01.460 --> 01:20:01.880
&gt;&gt; Well, yeah.

01:20:01.880 --> 01:20:08.380
I think one of the most
inspiring things about HITRECORD

01:20:08.380 --> 01:20:11.810
for me is that there's
no end to the creativity

01:20:11.810 --> 01:20:15.990
that is contributed every day,
whether that's writing or music

01:20:15.990 --> 01:20:19.770
or animation or --
I mean, stop motion,

01:20:19.770 --> 01:20:22.230
claymation, all sorts of things.

01:20:22.230 --> 01:20:25.670
And what's -- one of the things

01:20:25.670 --> 01:20:31.710
that I've learned is the
more people who have a say

01:20:31.710 --> 01:20:37.150
and the more people who are a
part of the art that we make,

01:20:37.150 --> 01:20:41.270
the richer these stories,
the richer the art is,

01:20:41.270 --> 01:20:43.460
the more perspectives.

01:20:43.460 --> 01:20:48.690
And we just hear stories that
we just never would have written

01:20:48.690 --> 01:20:51.720
ourselves because
we just didn't --

01:20:51.720 --> 01:20:55.550
we don't have that experience.

01:20:55.550 --> 01:20:58.480
When we were doing the first
season of our television show,

01:20:58.480 --> 01:21:01.620
the first episode of our
show was regarding --

01:21:01.620 --> 01:21:04.230
we had art and ideas and --

01:21:04.230 --> 01:21:06.440
about regarding a
different theme.

01:21:06.440 --> 01:21:08.890
Each episode is regarding
a different theme.

01:21:08.890 --> 01:21:11.460
And the first episode was
regarding the number one.

01:21:11.460 --> 01:21:16.040
And we had a -- we had a -- we
put out a call to action to say,

01:21:16.040 --> 01:21:19.850
"Tell us about your -- tell
us your stories regarding your

01:21:19.850 --> 01:21:20.660
first time."

01:21:20.660 --> 01:21:22.340
And that was your first
time doing anything.

01:21:22.340 --> 01:21:26.190
So people wrote all sorts of
stories, contributed stories,

01:21:26.190 --> 01:21:29.930
and one girl wrote a
story about the first time

01:21:29.930 --> 01:21:33.390
that she saw the stars
when she was 16 years old.

01:21:33.390 --> 01:21:35.020
She has a rare eye disorder

01:21:35.020 --> 01:21:38.070
where she can't see
pinpoints of light.

01:21:38.070 --> 01:21:44.480
And when she was 16, her Dad
bought her night vision goggles

01:21:44.480 --> 01:21:47.190
to allow her to see the
stars for the first time.

01:21:47.190 --> 01:21:50.890
And that's just a story that
we never would have heard

01:21:50.890 --> 01:21:53.090
if we just hired
a bunch of writers

01:21:53.090 --> 01:21:55.390
in Hollywood in a writer's room.

01:21:55.390 --> 01:22:01.300
But when you have such a
huge community of artists

01:22:01.300 --> 01:22:04.560
that are contributing
ideas to these stories,

01:22:04.560 --> 01:22:09.690
I think that's the most
surprising thing is every

01:22:09.690 --> 01:22:12.230
collaboration that we
do is you never know --

01:22:12.230 --> 01:22:14.350
we always have to throw caution
to the wind whenever we --

01:22:14.350 --> 01:22:17.280
and can't plan too much
about where we're going to go

01:22:17.280 --> 01:22:19.330
with a certain project
because we go

01:22:19.330 --> 01:22:21.520
where the community wants to go.

01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:25.490
It's where we --
where's the story going?

01:22:25.490 --> 01:22:29.740
And I think that's -- again, one
of the most surprising things

01:22:29.740 --> 01:22:36.170
and the thing that I
love about creating art

01:22:36.170 --> 01:22:38.930
in a digital space is that
you just have the scale

01:22:38.930 --> 01:22:42.770
of people with different ideas.

01:22:42.770 --> 01:22:46.040
&gt;&gt; That was the last question?

01:22:46.040 --> 01:22:48.060
[ Inaudible ]

01:22:48.060 --> 01:22:48.920
Okay. All right.

01:22:48.920 --> 01:22:53.270
Well, I guess we're
to the last question.

01:22:53.270 --> 01:22:58.510
Okay. Can each of you briefly
state what do you think the

01:22:58.510 --> 01:22:59.440
future holds?

01:22:59.440 --> 01:23:03.050
And let's start with Jared.

01:23:03.050 --> 01:23:04.640
&gt;&gt; Future.

01:23:04.640 --> 01:23:05.170
&gt;&gt; Future holds.

01:23:05.170 --> 01:23:08.640
Specifically, I imagine,
with regards to art making

01:23:08.640 --> 01:23:10.960
and the digital space
and copyright.

01:23:10.960 --> 01:23:13.690
I think -- first
of all, I think --

01:23:13.690 --> 01:23:17.490
and one of the things I was
thinking about on the plane ride

01:23:17.490 --> 01:23:23.920
over here was just the fact
that World IP Day exists

01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:27.160
and people are learning
more about what that means

01:23:27.160 --> 01:23:30.090
and educating artists
as to the value

01:23:30.090 --> 01:23:35.390
of their contribution
is a huge step forward

01:23:35.390 --> 01:23:41.720
in us not only understanding
what the value of our ideas

01:23:41.720 --> 01:23:44.620
in art is but what
we can do about it.

01:23:44.620 --> 01:23:48.380
And so I'm -- I think it's
going to be an evolution.

01:23:48.380 --> 01:23:52.920
I think there's always going
to be a push and pull and --

01:23:52.920 --> 01:24:00.280
but I'm extremely optimistic
just -- and I said it earlier,

01:24:00.280 --> 01:24:05.860
but meeting everybody here who
is so passionate about copyright

01:24:05.860 --> 01:24:10.930
and figuring things
out with artists,

01:24:10.930 --> 01:24:14.780
I think it's a challenging time,
but it's a really inspiring

01:24:14.780 --> 01:24:18.380
and exciting time to
be a part of this.

01:24:18.380 --> 01:24:20.940
There's -- I think it's --

01:24:20.940 --> 01:24:25.920
what a pressing issue and
what an exciting time to help

01:24:25.920 --> 01:24:29.130
to start figuring
these things out.

01:24:29.130 --> 01:24:29.970
&gt;&gt; Excellent.

01:24:29.970 --> 01:24:31.460
Anna?

01:24:31.460 --> 01:24:34.270
&gt;&gt; That is such an
amazing question.

01:24:34.270 --> 01:24:35.350
&gt;&gt; No wrong answers.

01:24:35.350 --> 01:24:36.330
&gt;&gt; Yeah, no.

01:24:36.330 --> 01:24:37.480
It's true.

01:24:37.480 --> 01:24:41.470
I think about this
a lot actually just

01:24:41.470 --> 01:24:45.610
from the perspective of
the other work that I do,

01:24:45.610 --> 01:24:47.250
which is to help artists grow

01:24:47.250 --> 01:24:49.330
in their own professional
development

01:24:49.330 --> 01:24:52.850
and grow their businesses and
grow their living and a life --

01:24:52.850 --> 01:24:55.320
that's such a wonderful slogan.

01:24:55.320 --> 01:24:58.980
That's what we work really
hard to do at Springboard.

01:24:58.980 --> 01:25:05.890
And I think there's this
really interesting tension

01:25:05.890 --> 01:25:09.650
between collaboration -- this
is a word that I think all

01:25:09.650 --> 01:25:14.710
of us talk about -- and then
also having an individual voice.

01:25:14.710 --> 01:25:22.390
And I think that something in
the future will present a "yes,

01:25:22.390 --> 01:25:27.540
and" solution to this
tension in such a way

01:25:27.540 --> 01:25:32.090
where our human species,
the creativity that happens

01:25:32.090 --> 01:25:35.800
when human beings get
together to make art work

01:25:35.800 --> 01:25:38.070
and to push our culture forward,

01:25:38.070 --> 01:25:40.620
which is truly the most
inspirational thing I can

01:25:40.620 --> 01:25:42.290
think of.

01:25:42.290 --> 01:25:45.370
When that can happen
and also acknowledge all

01:25:45.370 --> 01:25:48.680
of the individual voices that
went into that happening,

01:25:48.680 --> 01:25:53.100
and I'm so inspired by all of
the efforts that everyone here

01:25:53.100 --> 01:25:56.500
on the stage are
making to do that,

01:25:56.500 --> 01:26:00.230
so I think that is an optimistic
what I think will happen

01:26:00.230 --> 01:26:04.690
in the future for the arts and
for artists is this, again,

01:26:04.690 --> 01:26:09.330
realization of the movement
forward as a collective

01:26:09.330 --> 01:26:12.060
and also the individual
voice being recognized.

01:26:12.060 --> 01:26:12.970
&gt;&gt; Great, great.

01:26:12.970 --> 01:26:14.270
Chase, the future?

01:26:14.270 --> 01:26:18.280
&gt;&gt; I'm inspired by
my stage mates here.

01:26:18.280 --> 01:26:22.740
I think Jared, you said it well
with -- it's an exciting time.

01:26:22.740 --> 01:26:24.610
We used the word tension
a lot last night as well.

01:26:24.610 --> 01:26:26.530
I think it is the most
exciting time in the history

01:26:26.530 --> 01:26:28.000
of the world to be a creator.

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:32.150
I think there is a tension
around sort of preserving

01:26:32.150 --> 01:26:34.920
that in a way that
maintains sustenance

01:26:34.920 --> 01:26:37.370
for the people who create.

01:26:37.370 --> 01:26:40.450
As the world sort of
commodifies so many things

01:26:40.450 --> 01:26:43.610
and goods are being made
cheaper and cheaper all the time

01:26:43.610 --> 01:26:48.380
and in many ways, intellectual
property is becoming

01:26:48.380 --> 01:26:55.120
commoditized, how do we keep
this from being a problem?

01:26:55.120 --> 01:26:59.300
To me, that is a very, very
-- it is the responsibility --

01:26:59.300 --> 01:27:04.530
I'm honored to hear that
people love World IP Day.

01:27:04.530 --> 01:27:07.260
That you are out there thinking
about that on a daily basis.

01:27:07.260 --> 01:27:10.220
I believe deeply that this
is very much a packaging

01:27:10.220 --> 01:27:13.120
and an access challenge.

01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:14.720
The packaging --

01:27:14.720 --> 01:27:17.470
I have litigated against
a publicly traded company.

01:27:17.470 --> 01:27:19.880
I want to say thanks to Gene
Mopsik from the ASMP for helping

01:27:19.880 --> 01:27:21.760
to support it, five years,

01:27:21.760 --> 01:27:24.520
hundreds of thousands
of dollars in costs.

01:27:24.520 --> 01:27:27.230
I had a -- it was against
-- I'll just say it,

01:27:27.230 --> 01:27:29.840
it was against K2,
a ski manufacturer.

01:27:29.840 --> 01:27:31.890
It's a well-documented case.

01:27:31.890 --> 01:27:33.860
It was more than
150 infringements.

01:27:33.860 --> 01:27:35.040
Cost me five years of my life.

01:27:35.040 --> 01:27:37.820
I had to testify in
federal court for three days

01:27:37.820 --> 01:27:40.770
by an attorney that was making
12 hundred dollars an hour

01:27:40.770 --> 01:27:41.770
to be there.

01:27:41.770 --> 01:27:46.940
And that -- we won that case and
had to appeal our own victory

01:27:46.940 --> 01:27:49.930
because the judgment was
written in such a way

01:27:49.930 --> 01:27:51.620
that it was bad for artists.

01:27:51.620 --> 01:27:53.840
So we appealed that, and it
went to the Ninth Circuit Court

01:27:53.840 --> 01:27:56.450
of Appeals where we
won that as well.

01:27:56.450 --> 01:27:59.300
And I loved the opening
remarks because if you think

01:27:59.300 --> 01:28:03.050
that cost me hundreds of
thousands of dollars in order

01:28:03.050 --> 01:28:05.920
to do that, and what
K2, the reason --

01:28:05.920 --> 01:28:09.950
I had a voice message that
accidentally was removed

01:28:09.950 --> 01:28:13.090
at some point from my message
because it was saved so long

01:28:13.090 --> 01:28:16.380
of the vice president saying
really unpleasant things

01:28:16.380 --> 01:28:19.730
to me like, "You don't know
who you're f-- - - - g with."

01:28:19.730 --> 01:28:23.200
And if that is the plight
of artists going forward,

01:28:23.200 --> 01:28:26.080
we're in a real bad spot.

01:28:26.080 --> 01:28:29.560
If the people in this room
can usurp that mentality

01:28:29.560 --> 01:28:33.320
and if we can through a
packaging exercise of making --

01:28:33.320 --> 01:28:36.540
World IP Day is a great
step, but let's make it sexy

01:28:36.540 --> 01:28:39.650
to understand that there
is value in our creators.

01:28:39.650 --> 01:28:43.530
Let's create access to that
information because access

01:28:43.530 --> 01:28:46.440
to information is
really what helps sort

01:28:46.440 --> 01:28:49.020
of the tide rise
with all the boats.

01:28:49.020 --> 01:28:53.060
By and large, I find that most
of my peers who are struggling

01:28:53.060 --> 01:28:55.300
to make a living and a life is

01:28:55.300 --> 01:28:58.370
because they either
have not chosen to

01:28:58.370 --> 01:29:00.170
or they don't have
an understanding

01:29:00.170 --> 01:29:02.180
of access to that information.

01:29:02.180 --> 01:29:06.150
So my ask is that that
is what the committees,

01:29:06.150 --> 01:29:11.630
the Copyright Office,
Congress consider as their sort

01:29:11.630 --> 01:29:14.740
of their future,
their future moves.

01:29:14.740 --> 01:29:17.610
It's an incredibly
exciting time.

01:29:17.610 --> 01:29:19.050
It's a little bit dangerous,

01:29:19.050 --> 01:29:22.540
and I believe our
fate is in good hands.

01:29:22.540 --> 01:29:25.050
Good shall persevere.

to open it up to the audience

01:29:32.700 --> 01:29:34.150
if anybody has any questions.

01:29:34.150 --> 01:29:35.640
I believe there are microphones,

01:29:35.640 --> 01:29:38.360
so if you could wait
for the mic.

01:29:38.360 --> 01:29:39.970
Don't be shy.

01:29:43.990 --> 01:29:47.430
We came all the way across
the country for this.

&gt;&gt; Now's your chance.

01:29:51.060 --> 01:29:55.200
There's a gift for the
first person who asks.

01:29:55.200 --> 01:29:59.130
&gt;&gt; Hi. My name is
[inaudible], the US editor

01:29:59.130 --> 01:30:02.030
for a magazine called
Music Week,

01:30:02.030 --> 01:30:03.710
and I cover copyright issues.

01:30:03.710 --> 01:30:04.830
Oh, thank you for the gift.

01:30:04.830 --> 01:30:05.800
That's lovely.

01:30:05.800 --> 01:30:07.210
I didn't know there was one.

01:30:07.210 --> 01:30:08.230
I thought you were just --

01:30:08.230 --> 01:30:11.180
The Copyright Alliance
serves a purpose --

01:30:11.180 --> 01:30:15.900
there's one thing in the videos
and also in a couple of things

01:30:15.900 --> 01:30:18.440
that you said about
information wants to be free.

01:30:18.440 --> 01:30:21.800
Isn't there a problem when
every time you mention the work

01:30:21.800 --> 01:30:26.920
of art, actually it becomes
information, i.e. one and zero.

01:30:26.920 --> 01:30:31.490
And the semantics are important
in a sense that whenever --

01:30:31.490 --> 01:30:33.390
and it really used to upset me

01:30:33.390 --> 01:30:35.040
when I think information
wants to be free.

01:30:35.040 --> 01:30:36.690
Therefore, we can access music.

01:30:36.690 --> 01:30:39.460
We can access photography,
etc. These are not --

01:30:39.460 --> 01:30:40.700
this is not information.

01:30:40.700 --> 01:30:42.240
These are works of art.

01:30:42.240 --> 01:30:46.060
So shouldn't we start by
instead of saying information,

01:30:46.060 --> 01:30:49.590
saying that these are works of
art and that will help everyone

01:30:49.590 --> 01:30:51.550
to actually understand
what it is?

01:30:51.550 --> 01:30:53.800
&gt;&gt; To be clear, I was talking
about information in terms

01:30:53.800 --> 01:30:55.990
of access to the information
about art, not actually

01:30:55.990 --> 01:30:57.440
about art in and of itself.

01:30:57.440 --> 01:31:01.010
But I understand very,
very deeply your --

01:31:01.010 --> 01:31:02.920
how the challenge exists there.

01:31:02.920 --> 01:31:05.280
Again, I dropped out of a
Ph.D. in the Philosophy of Art

01:31:05.280 --> 01:31:10.200
so this is really, really
an interesting area for me.

01:31:10.200 --> 01:31:13.150
The -- I guess I
don't want to pretend

01:31:13.150 --> 01:31:14.250
that it's not complicated.

01:31:14.250 --> 01:31:16.700
And if we've had some of
the brightest thinkers

01:31:16.700 --> 01:31:21.140
of our times struggling
in politics,

01:31:21.140 --> 01:31:24.270
in the Copyright Office, in our
government and governments all

01:31:24.270 --> 01:31:26.550
over the world -- if
there's a real challenge

01:31:26.550 --> 01:31:28.900
to overcoming these problems,
I don't think one of us

01:31:28.900 --> 01:31:30.710
from the stage is
going to answer it.

01:31:30.710 --> 01:31:32.820
But let's actually acknowledge

01:31:32.820 --> 01:31:36.760
that what you've said
is the central problem.

01:31:36.760 --> 01:31:41.160
There really is a gap between
saying well, this is just a mess

01:31:41.160 --> 01:31:44.000
and what do we do about
it, and saying actually,

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:45.400
let's identify the problem.

01:31:45.400 --> 01:31:48.300
The problem is that is
one very precise problem

01:31:48.300 --> 01:31:50.440
that we need to try and solve.

01:31:50.440 --> 01:31:54.340
And to say that it's just
too big for us to tackle.

01:31:54.340 --> 01:31:56.510
We have a history
in this country.

01:31:56.510 --> 01:31:58.240
Our law was created over time.

01:31:58.240 --> 01:32:00.330
We didn't just walk out
and say this is the law.

01:32:00.330 --> 01:32:03.490
I think I know just a little
bit about the philosophy of law,

01:32:03.490 --> 01:32:07.760
and it was created over time,
and it continues to evolve.

01:32:07.760 --> 01:32:08.900
We have to put a
stake in the ground

01:32:08.900 --> 01:32:10.930
and saying these are a couple
of the central challenges

01:32:10.930 --> 01:32:11.920
that we're going
to try and solve.

01:32:11.920 --> 01:32:14.000
And if we don't put
a pin in those things

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:15.740
and start working
toward that solution,

01:32:15.740 --> 01:32:16.800
we certainly will
never get there.

01:32:16.800 --> 01:32:17.520
You know that saying?

01:32:17.520 --> 01:32:18.680
If you don't have a
map, you're not going

01:32:18.680 --> 01:32:20.140
to get where you're going.

01:32:20.140 --> 01:32:21.710
You can't just walk
in the woods.

01:32:21.710 --> 01:32:24.210
Or even a broken clock
is right twice a day,

01:32:24.210 --> 01:32:25.500
whatever that saying is.

01:32:25.500 --> 01:32:27.400
We need to identify the problem.

01:32:27.400 --> 01:32:29.480
Keep going.

01:32:29.480 --> 01:32:31.430
Come on, you guys.

01:32:31.430 --> 01:32:34.470
&gt;&gt; To build upon what you
were saying, there is a --

01:32:34.470 --> 01:32:35.580
I think there is a culture

01:32:35.580 --> 01:32:39.580
because that is the
central problem.

01:32:39.580 --> 01:32:44.790
Well, I'll just share
this music or I have no --

01:32:44.790 --> 01:32:50.490
people might be predisposed to
be fine with just taking music

01:32:50.490 --> 01:32:55.470
or in essence, stealing music,
because that's just the culture

01:32:55.470 --> 01:32:56.390
that we're now living in.

01:32:56.390 --> 01:32:58.500
And I think that
you said it right.

01:32:58.500 --> 01:33:02.490
All right, now I think it's
really raising our hands

01:33:02.490 --> 01:33:04.500
and saying actually
this, understanding

01:33:04.500 --> 01:33:07.170
that this is a problem,
understanding that this way

01:33:07.170 --> 01:33:10.870
of thinking shouldn't be the way
of thinking and then figuring

01:33:10.870 --> 01:33:13.190
out well, how do
we deal with this?

01:33:13.190 --> 01:33:16.710
But it is -- I do think that
we are living in a culture

01:33:16.710 --> 01:33:20.280
where I think there
are a lot of people

01:33:20.280 --> 01:33:23.380
who just think it's okay
because it's so easy.

01:33:23.380 --> 01:33:27.960
How could something
so easy not be okay?

01:33:27.960 --> 01:33:34.360
So it's identifying that problem
and then figuring it out.

01:33:34.360 --> 01:33:37.510
&gt;&gt; And also I think identifying

01:33:37.510 --> 01:33:39.490
where there are solutions
already embedded

01:33:39.490 --> 01:33:44.860
into that question and the
problem because what I find is

01:33:44.860 --> 01:33:48.170
that artists don't --
smaller artists, anyway,

01:33:48.170 --> 01:33:52.250
don't tend to have the
problem of too much exposure.

01:33:52.250 --> 01:33:56.850
In fact, they really need
more exposure and that idea

01:33:56.850 --> 01:34:00.000
of turning what they
do into information

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:03.340
that can be widely distributed
is often times the thing

01:34:03.340 --> 01:34:06.060
that gives them the
living and the life

01:34:06.060 --> 01:34:09.380
that they can then build upon.

01:34:09.380 --> 01:34:11.650
And so, yeah, I think there's --

01:34:11.650 --> 01:34:15.290
I'm going to use the word
tension again because it --

01:34:15.290 --> 01:34:19.460
certainly -- maybe it's the
two sides of the same coin

01:34:19.460 --> 01:34:23.230
that there is the asset
to information going

01:34:23.230 --> 01:34:26.290
out to the masses and then
there's also what we have

01:34:26.290 --> 01:34:29.920
to do is protect that too.

01:34:29.920 --> 01:34:30.820
Yeah.

01:34:30.820 --> 01:34:36.290
&gt;&gt; Hi. How would your
company protect --

01:34:36.290 --> 01:34:45.290
okay, say if I was to submit
something to your company,

01:34:45.290 --> 01:34:50.330
a picture, and how would
you protect that from those

01:34:50.330 --> 01:34:54.130
who are trying to make a
income, a passive income?

01:34:54.130 --> 01:35:00.400
Say Amazon has a way where you
can copyright somebody's work.

01:35:00.400 --> 01:35:05.620
With HITRECORD, how would you
protect the work that I submit?

01:35:05.620 --> 01:35:10.260
&gt;&gt; If I'm understanding your --
I don't know the Amazon service

01:35:10.260 --> 01:35:11.670
that you're referencing --

01:35:11.670 --> 01:35:14.710
if I'm to understand
your question correctly.

01:35:14.710 --> 01:35:21.530
If you were to upload a
picture and somebody else were

01:35:21.530 --> 01:35:25.140
to download it and try to
make money off of it outside

01:35:25.140 --> 01:35:30.660
of the website, actually we --
it gets back to the question

01:35:30.660 --> 01:35:32.770
about non-exclusivity.

01:35:32.770 --> 01:35:34.710
We don't represent --

01:35:34.710 --> 01:35:38.650
if you were to do
that and it happens --

01:35:38.650 --> 01:35:41.660
I shouldn't say that
it happens --

01:35:41.660 --> 01:35:46.220
I'm not aware of a case where
somebody would download a photo

01:35:46.220 --> 01:35:49.680
and make money, but I
know that there are cases

01:35:49.680 --> 01:35:53.210
where people would
download art off of our site

01:35:53.210 --> 01:35:56.830
and perhaps put it on
Tumblr or on Facebook

01:35:56.830 --> 01:35:59.880
and perhaps there's a
monetization stream that way.

01:35:59.880 --> 01:36:04.460
But we don't represent
the artists for protection

01:36:04.460 --> 01:36:05.440
against that sort of thing.

01:36:05.440 --> 01:36:10.230
And if we did, we would then
require the exclusive rights

01:36:10.230 --> 01:36:13.130
to your IP because then
we can represent you.

01:36:13.130 --> 01:36:15.190
There is an infrastructure
for us to do that.

01:36:15.190 --> 01:36:22.010
We essentially have a
license for us to work with

01:36:22.010 --> 01:36:25.790
and to monetize along
with other people's art.

01:36:25.790 --> 01:36:32.970
So I guess the short
answer is that could happen.

01:36:32.970 --> 01:36:38.310
That's for the artist
to represent themselves.

01:36:38.310 --> 01:36:43.940
That is to say when people make
us aware that things are going

01:36:43.940 --> 01:36:48.380
on with either one
member or a combination --

01:36:48.380 --> 01:36:50.960
if somebody takes your
photo and combines it

01:36:50.960 --> 01:36:54.410
with another member's photo and
tries to do something with it,

01:36:54.410 --> 01:37:01.160
we do make best efforts
to try to make it right.

01:37:01.160 --> 01:37:04.380
But at the end of the day,
we don't have the authority

01:37:04.380 --> 01:37:06.340
to speak on behalf
of the artists

01:37:06.340 --> 01:37:08.770
because we don't have
that kind of license.

01:37:08.770 --> 01:37:14.280
&gt;&gt; I think we have to end.

01:37:14.280 --> 01:37:15.600
Sorry.

01:37:15.600 --> 01:37:16.340
&gt;&gt; Okay.

01:37:16.340 --> 01:37:19.150
&gt;&gt; They'll be here briefly, I
think, after the event if you'd

01:37:19.150 --> 01:37:20.390
like to talk to them
a little bit.

01:37:20.390 --> 01:37:24.620
But would you please help me
thank them for being here today?

[ Applause ]

01:37:33.090 --> 01:37:34.530
As Register, I'll
take the liberty

01:37:34.530 --> 01:37:36.470
of offering a few
closing remarks.

01:37:36.470 --> 01:37:39.470
Just summarizing
what I just heard.

01:37:39.470 --> 01:37:40.860
Obviously, being an artist

01:37:40.860 --> 01:37:44.570
from what you can tell is an
extremely disciplined craft

01:37:44.570 --> 01:37:47.110
and a lifetime craft at that.

01:37:47.110 --> 01:37:50.880
I agree wholeheartedly with
Chase and his observation

01:37:50.880 --> 01:37:53.240
that you should not, if
you're an artist listening

01:37:53.240 --> 01:37:57.290
to this today or will listen
to it later on our website --

01:37:57.290 --> 01:37:59.770
don't underestimate
participation

01:37:59.770 --> 01:38:01.340
from our nation's artists

01:38:01.340 --> 01:38:04.040
in the copyright debates
going on currently.

01:38:04.040 --> 01:38:07.040
It would be illogical
to have a copyright act

01:38:07.040 --> 01:38:11.540
that does not protect and
support our creative voices.

01:38:11.540 --> 01:38:14.470
We're doing our best in
the Copyright Office.

01:38:14.470 --> 01:38:15.780
There are many organizations

01:38:15.780 --> 01:38:17.940
that obviously agree
with that principle.

01:38:17.940 --> 01:38:21.400
Certainly, Congress does, but
they need to hear from you.

01:38:21.400 --> 01:38:26.440
I'm tempted to provide the
recommendation to Congress

01:38:26.440 --> 01:38:29.760
that they should take
Jared's business model

01:38:29.760 --> 01:38:34.980
of giving everybody two weeks
to weigh in on any proposal

01:38:34.980 --> 01:38:38.310
that comes off the Hill, and
then they'll make a decision.

01:38:38.310 --> 01:38:39.540
I'm not sure it'll go that way.

01:38:39.540 --> 01:38:43.020
So instead, I'll end with Anna's
observation that of course,

01:38:43.020 --> 01:38:45.880
even in the copyright
debate, there is a tension

01:38:45.880 --> 01:38:49.730
between expressing one's
individual goals or perspective

01:38:49.730 --> 01:38:51.630
and then collaborating
with others.

01:38:51.630 --> 01:38:55.810
And of course, we have
to have both so here's

01:38:55.810 --> 01:38:59.290
to working together for the
next great Copyright Act.

01:38:59.290 --> 01:39:03.680
Thanks.

01:39:03.680 --> 01:39:07.330

of the Library of Congress.
