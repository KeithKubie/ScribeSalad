actually start with just asking you in
 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.189
actually start with just asking you in
terms of motivation like where do you

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199
terms of motivation like where do you
 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.160
terms of motivation like where do you
think you get the most motivation from

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170
think you get the most motivation from
 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.460
think you get the most motivation from
to do your research it just comes I love

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470
to do your research it just comes I love
 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.980
to do your research it just comes I love
what I do I enjoy it every day I'd go in

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:26.990
what I do I enjoy it every day I'd go in
 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:29.450
what I do I enjoy it every day I'd go in
excited about seeing the people that I

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460
excited about seeing the people that I
 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.460
excited about seeing the people that I
work with the problems that we're

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470
work with the problems that we're
 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.810
work with the problems that we're
working on yeah I would do it for free

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:34.820
working on yeah I would do it for free
 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.310
working on yeah I would do it for free
but do you think it has changed from

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320
but do you think it has changed from
 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.770
but do you think it has changed from
when you were a PhD to like a postdoc

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780
when you were a PhD to like a postdoc
 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.930
when you were a PhD to like a postdoc
and then being a PI and having your own

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940
and then being a PI and having your own
 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.869
and then being a PI and having your own
lab of where you get that kind of joy

00:00:43.869 --> 00:00:43.879
lab of where you get that kind of joy
 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:46.299
lab of where you get that kind of joy
from or is it the same kind of inner

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:46.309
from or is it the same kind of inner
 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:48.650
from or is it the same kind of inner
source somehow that magically is just

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660
source somehow that magically is just
 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:49.279
source somehow that magically is just
there

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289
there
 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.500
there
well the joy comes up and down right

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510
well the joy comes up and down right
 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.790
well the joy comes up and down right
there some days are less joyful than

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800
there some days are less joyful than
 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.479
there some days are less joyful than
others but it's it gets easier as you go

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489
others but it's it gets easier as you go
 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.840
others but it's it gets easier as you go
through your career it does well because

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850
through your career it does well because
 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.960
through your career it does well because
think about it I have 20 people in my

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970
think about it I have 20 people in my
 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.149
think about it I have 20 people in my
group so I can focus on the good things

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159
group so I can focus on the good things
 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.789
group so I can focus on the good things
that are happening and the poor people

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799
that are happening and the poor people
 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.969
that are happening and the poor people
that are struggling their days are not

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979
that are struggling their days are not
 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.219
that are struggling their days are not
very joyful but mine are joyful because

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229
very joyful but mine are joyful because
 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.440
very joyful but mine are joyful because
I get to focus on all the other good

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450
I get to focus on all the other good
 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.630
I get to focus on all the other good
things so I get to spread it out a

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640
things so I get to spread it out a
 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.660
things so I get to spread it out a
little bit more now that I'm leading a

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670
little bit more now that I'm leading a
 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.910
little bit more now that I'm leading a
group but even as a graduate student you

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920
group but even as a graduate student you
 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.980
group but even as a graduate student you
have the joy of learning of filling your

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990
have the joy of learning of filling your
 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.520
have the joy of learning of filling your
brain with completely new ideas of

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530
brain with completely new ideas of
 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.740
brain with completely new ideas of
listening to the best people in the

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750
listening to the best people in the
 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.770
listening to the best people in the
world I was at Berkeley at the time my

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780
world I was at Berkeley at the time my
 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.249
world I was at Berkeley at the time my
teachers were household names in

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259
teachers were household names in
 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:45.590
teachers were household names in
biochemistry and engineering so for me

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600
biochemistry and engineering so for me
 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.399
biochemistry and engineering so for me
that joy was just taking in all this new

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409
that joy was just taking in all this new
 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.969
that joy was just taking in all this new
knowledge so how come that you went into

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979
knowledge so how come that you went into
 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.170
knowledge so how come that you went into
chemistry and when do you think that was

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180
chemistry and when do you think that was
 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.550
chemistry and when do you think that was
I mean okay today of course it was the

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560
I mean okay today of course it was the
 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.109
I mean okay today of course it was the
right move now you know right there were

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119
right move now you know right there were
 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.209
right move now you know right there were
you scared about it where it's not the

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219
you scared about it where it's not the
 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.069
you scared about it where it's not the
least bit I was not the least bit scared

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079
least bit I was not the least bit scared
 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.039
least bit I was not the least bit scared
and I'll tell you that the people who

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049
and I'll tell you that the people who
 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.650
and I'll tell you that the people who
joined my laboratory no one knows

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660
joined my laboratory no one knows
 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.700
joined my laboratory no one knows
anything about protein engineering I

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:12.710
anything about protein engineering I
 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:15.280
anything about protein engineering I

inside their refrigerator I take those

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620
inside their refrigerator I take those
 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.940
inside their refrigerator I take those
people and they learn something totally

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950
people and they learn something totally
 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.250
people and they learn something totally
new and those are the adventuresome ones

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260
new and those are the adventuresome ones
 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.860
new and those are the adventuresome ones
those are the people who will change the

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870
those are the people who will change the
 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:36.460
those are the people who will change the

right because they're willing to step
out often from a whole new country doing

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780
out often from a whole new country doing
 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.320
out often from a whole new country doing
whole new science and if you can't do

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330
whole new science and if you can't do
 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.100
whole new science and if you can't do
that when you're 22 when can you do it

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110
that when you're 22 when can you do it
 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.020
that when you're 22 when can you do it
is that what you look for in people when

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030
is that what you look for in people when
 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.670
is that what you look for in people when
they come turning your lap fearlessness

if you're going to change the world
 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.660
if you're going to change the world
you've got to try really different

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670
you've got to try really different
 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.170
you've got to try really different
things fair enough yeah I wanted to ask

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180
things fair enough yeah I wanted to ask
 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.500
things fair enough yeah I wanted to ask
you also because they're the Nobel Prize

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510
you also because they're the Nobel Prize
 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.840
you also because they're the Nobel Prize

course then did the most for humankind

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370
course then did the most for humankind
 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.790
course then did the most for humankind
and what aspect you think in your

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800
and what aspect you think in your
 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.300
and what aspect you think in your
science did the most for humankind I

science did the most for humankind I
 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.580
science did the most for humankind I
mean if it's a it's a great discovery

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590
mean if it's a it's a great discovery
 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.650
mean if it's a it's a great discovery
but of course also it has from what I've

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660
but of course also it has from what I've
 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:21.940
but of course also it has from what I've
understood I'm not a chemist right but

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950
understood I'm not a chemist right but
 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.040
understood I'm not a chemist right but
you can use it actually to a lot of

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.050
you can use it actually to a lot of
 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:25.750
you can use it actually to a lot of
different approaches or a lot of

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760
different approaches or a lot of
 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.970
different approaches or a lot of
different things look at chemistry

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980
different things look at chemistry
 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.370
different things look at chemistry
chemistry makes everything we use in our

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380
chemistry makes everything we use in our
 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.230
chemistry makes everything we use in our
daily lives everything in this room was

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:32.240
daily lives everything in this room was
 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.540
daily lives everything in this room was
made by chemistry and in the past

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:34.550
made by chemistry and in the past
 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:37.240
made by chemistry and in the past
chemistry hasn't been very clean we

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250
chemistry hasn't been very clean we
 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.400
chemistry hasn't been very clean we
create a lot of waste in the industry we

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410
create a lot of waste in the industry we
 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.250
create a lot of waste in the industry we
use toxic metals that have to be mined

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260
use toxic metals that have to be mined
 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.200
use toxic metals that have to be mined
and create pollution

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:47.210
and create pollution
 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:50.680
and create pollution
I want to revolutionize the way we make

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690
I want to revolutionize the way we make
 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:53.790
I want to revolutionize the way we make
chemistry and the way we do chemistry

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:53.800
chemistry and the way we do chemistry
 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.130
chemistry and the way we do chemistry
I'd love to see all chemists replaced by

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.140
I'd love to see all chemists replaced by
 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.760
I'd love to see all chemists replaced by
bacteria my chemistry friends aren't too

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:00.770
bacteria my chemistry friends aren't too
 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:03.550
bacteria my chemistry friends aren't too
happy about that but think about making

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560
happy about that but think about making
 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.100
happy about that but think about making
all the molecules and chemicals and

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:06.110
all the molecules and chemicals and
 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:08.860
all the molecules and chemicals and

that's a great vision somebody has to

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650
that's a great vision somebody has to
 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:17.920
that's a great vision somebody has to
implement it and those are the methods

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930
implement it and those are the methods
 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.370
implement it and those are the methods
that I've developed to do that so

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380
that I've developed to do that so
 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.740

in companies and
 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:27.860
in companies and
different research labs and we're

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870
different research labs and we're
 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:29.990
different research labs and we're
starting to learn how to program

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000
starting to learn how to program
 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.260

also in terms of you know bacteria up

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050
also in terms of you know bacteria up
 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.340
also in terms of you know bacteria up
and using but it's a lot of antibiotic

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:45.350
and using but it's a lot of antibiotic

well I use bacteria you could use plants

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270
well I use bacteria you could use plants
 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.900

talking necessarily about chemistry but
 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.270
talking necessarily about chemistry but
in a very broad sense imagine if you got

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280
in a very broad sense imagine if you got

go this way where do you think we should
 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:32.510
go this way where do you think we should
go well we clearly have to figure out

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520
go well we clearly have to figure out
 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.670
go well we clearly have to figure out
how to live sustainably right if we're

what I wanted to do I wanted to create
 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:21.530
what I wanted to do I wanted to create
or help create the technologies that

or help create the technologies that
 

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:25.180
or help create the technologies that
would help us transition from

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:25.190
would help us transition from
 

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:28.070

that you're also new I mean that you had

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:35.370
that you're also new I mean that you had
 

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:36.560
that you're also new I mean that you had
that goal and then you really

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:36.570
that goal and then you really
 

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:39.560
that goal and then you really
it's uh it's very impressive if you

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:39.570
it's uh it's very impressive if you
 

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:41.150
it's uh it's very impressive if you
hadn't a different beginning of what you

wanted to achieve in this perfect world
 

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:47.390
wanted to achieve in this perfect world
but I also wanted to ask you when you

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:47.400
but I also wanted to ask you when you
 

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:49.880
but I also wanted to ask you when you
started and from what the scientific

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:49.890
started and from what the scientific
 

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:51.620
started and from what the scientific
community is now what do you think has

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:51.630
community is now what do you think has
 

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:53.240
community is now what do you think has
changed and what are the pros and the

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:53.250
changed and what are the pros and the
 

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:55.670
changed and what are the pros and the
cons of what science was maybe when you

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:55.680
cons of what science was maybe when you
 

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:57.620
cons of what science was maybe when you
started and what it is today

00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:57.630
started and what it is today
 

00:06:57.630 --> 00:06:59.840

because it's changing quite rapidly of
 

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:03.470
because it's changing quite rapidly of
how we do it things it's moving ever

I've got a computer in my head now doing
email all the time so it we have less

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:20.220
email all the time so it we have less

if I want if I value that and that seems
to me the biggest change maybe that's

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:34.020
to me the biggest change maybe that's
 

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:37.010
to me the biggest change maybe that's
just a change in my life though do you

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:37.020
just a change in my life though do you
 

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:39.380
just a change in my life though do you
feel that you have time to think no it's

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:39.390
feel that you have time to think no it's
 

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:42.050
feel that you have time to think no it's
actually for the first time because you

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:42.060
actually for the first time because you
 

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:43.550
actually for the first time because you
know you do your PhD and there's a lot

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:43.560
know you do your PhD and there's a lot
 

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:44.990
know you do your PhD and there's a lot
of experiments to be done and love data

I really feel that I get to go to work
and read what other people are doing and

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:54.960
and read what other people are doing and
 

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:57.200
and read what other people are doing and
then think about it and see you know

00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:57.210
then think about it and see you know
 

00:07:57.210 --> 00:07:59.510
then think about it and see you know
what do I really think about how these

00:07:59.510 --> 00:07:59.520
what do I really think about how these
 

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:01.310
what do I really think about how these
people are doing science where is my

00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:01.320
people are doing science where is my
 

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:03.320
people are doing science where is my
field actually because I started off

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:03.330
field actually because I started off
 

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:04.730
field actually because I started off
with a certain amount of knowledge and

00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:04.740
with a certain amount of knowledge and
 

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:06.740
with a certain amount of knowledge and
then you know you work you work so much

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:06.750
then you know you work you work so much
 

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:09.190
then you know you work you work so much
that at some point you kind of forget to

00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:09.200
that at some point you kind of forget to
 

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:12.350
that at some point you kind of forget to
to go back again and check wait where is

00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:12.360
to go back again and check wait where is
 

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:13.880
to go back again and check wait where is
my field now you know there's well

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:13.890
my field now you know there's well
 

00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:15.350
my field now you know there's well
that's a good point that's a good

00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:15.360
that's a good point that's a good
 

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:18.860
that's a good point that's a good
mechanism so I ask students to prepare

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:18.870
mechanism so I ask students to prepare
 

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:23.240

where do you have time to read a book on
 

00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:33.290

the fun of it but then you see the
 

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:47.710

we need the chance to do that but it

00:08:50.079 --> 00:08:50.089
we need the chance to do that but it
 

00:08:50.089 --> 00:08:51.939
