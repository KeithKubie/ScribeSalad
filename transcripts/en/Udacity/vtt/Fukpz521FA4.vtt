00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.560
Now that we've completed making
our prototype we'll want to gather

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:04.750
feedback using Envision.

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:09.720
There are two methods for
gathering feedback on your designs.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.002
First I previously
mentioned the share link.

00:00:13.002 --> 00:00:16.660
Share links are a great way to
gather feedback on your project.

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:21.070
You can also generate specific share
links that only display specific screens

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.070
in your project if your trying
to obtain targeted feedback.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.070
Another way to gather feedback
is through a live share meeting.

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.870
Live share meetings are instant meetings
where you can share your designs with

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.500
unlimited participants
in a live meeting.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.420
The meeting is free, and is similar
to a GoToMeeting, WebEx, join.me or

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.600
Google Hangout meeting.

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.280
In live share meetings, you can see
all participant cursors on screen.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.540
You can activate a drawing mode, where
everyone can draw over your designs.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.730
Participants of your meeting can
also leave contextual comments,

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.020
which get saved instantly,
just like they would when viewing and

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.100
commenting on a share link.
