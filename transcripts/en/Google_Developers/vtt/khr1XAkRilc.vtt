DYLAN THOMAS: Welcome to this
episode of "Behind The Map."

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:11.898
This is an occasional
series, where

00:00:11.898 --> 00:00:14.445
we talk with Googlers who
work on the Enterprise Maps

00:00:14.445 --> 00:00:15.700
for Business team.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:16.870
My name's Dylan Thomas.

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:18.660
I'm a community maps manager.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.840
And with me today is
Sean who is a product

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.187
manager on Google
Earth Enterprise.

00:00:23.187 --> 00:00:24.270
I'm very glad you're hear.

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:25.840
SEAN MADAY: Well, I
appreciate the opportunity.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.510
DYLAN THOMAS: All right,
well, let's get right into it.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:27.820
SEAN MADAY: All right.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:28.450
DYLAN THOMAS: Who are you?

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:29.364
What do you do?

00:00:29.364 --> 00:00:30.280
SEAN MADAY: All right.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.360
So my name is Sean Maday.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.110
I've been at Google
about 3 and 1/2 years.

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.110
My current role
is product manager

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.350
for Google Earth Enterprise and
Google Maps Engine Portable.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.700
Before this, I was
in this current role,

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.190
I was a sales engineer
for about 2 and 1/2 years

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.530
and had a great opportunity
to travel the world,

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.800
talk to folks who were
using maps, Google Maps,

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.630
in their enterprise
applications,

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.749
and help them find new creative
ways to unlock their data.

00:00:53.749 --> 00:00:54.540
DYLAN THOMAS: Cool.

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:55.998
So it sounds like
you've been doing

00:00:55.998 --> 00:00:57.560
GEO for at least a little while.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.135
How did you get into GEO?

00:00:59.135 --> 00:01:00.760
SEAN MADAY: Yeah,
it's a good question.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.750
I am not a classically
trained geographer.

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.880
I was in the Air
Force for five years,

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.170
and as an intelligence
officer, big part of what I did

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.350
was related to mapping
and remote sensing.

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.870
So I became a user and became
enamored with the Google

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.970
Enterprise product and I have
been working around the product

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:22.680
ever since.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:23.670
DYLAN THOMAS:
Enamored ever since.

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:24.230
SEAN MADAY: Absolutely.

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:25.710
DYLAN THOMAS: So I am a
classically trained geographer.

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.280
I'm not sure what that
means exactly, but yeah.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.780
SEAN MADAY: You can
probably tell me

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.689
things about plate tectonics
that I wouldn't understand.

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:34.980
DYLAN THOMAS: I should do that.

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:36.740
SEAN MADAY: OK, maybe that
could another "Behind the Map"

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.960
segment.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:37.970
DYLAN THOMAS: Exactly, right.

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:38.760
SEAN MADAY: I look
forward to that.

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:39.690
DYLAN THOMAS: So
one other question

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.030
before we get to what the
customers were wondering about

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.730
is just wondering
what you've got

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:45.790
excited about maps or
business right now.

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:46.590
What's interesting?

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.048
SEAN MADAY: Yeah,
overall, I think,

00:01:48.048 --> 00:01:50.350
the general trend
that has me excited,

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:51.900
has a lot of my
co-workers excited

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.640
is just the consumerization
of mapping technology.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.670
And this technology
used to be reserved

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.030
for just those remote sensing
scientists or those GIS

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.285
professionals.

00:02:02.285 --> 00:02:03.900
DYLAN THOMAS: Those classically
trained geographer types.

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:04.710
SEAN MADAY: Those darn
classically trained

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:05.905
geographers.

00:02:05.905 --> 00:02:08.030
And today, we're seeing
this technology just become

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:08.590
ubiquitous.

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.370
It's embedded in apps.

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.510
I used Uber this morning
to get to a shuttle stop,

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.160
and sure enough, I
dropped a pin on a map,

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.380
and maps have become
just another part

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.100
of the way we
communicate data and we

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.558
share information
with one another.

00:02:22.558 --> 00:02:24.079
And that trend is
really exciting.

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:25.870
DYLAN THOMAS: So the
ubiquity of it, right?

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:26.180
Is that what you're--

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.388
SEAN MADAY: Yeah, absolutely.

00:02:27.388 --> 00:02:29.752
And that ubiquity has so many
neat enterprise use cases.

00:02:29.752 --> 00:02:31.460
I was talking to an
organization recently

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:36.114
that manages a large campus
of hospital buildings,

00:02:36.114 --> 00:02:38.030
and they were using our
Google Maps Coordinate

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.540
to manage their tech support.

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.340
So when they dispatch
technical service reps out

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.290
into the field, they'd
go to fix a printer,

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.340
say, and they could on this
app, on this mobile app,

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.940
bring in floor plants
from Google Maps Engine,

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.990
and so they could just see not
only Google's road network,

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:58.957
but then the authoritative
floor plans--

00:02:58.957 --> 00:03:00.290
DYLAN THOMAS: The business data.

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.150
SEAN MADAY: Exactly, that the
University had shared with them

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.400
or the university medical
system had shared with them.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.630
And then from there,
they could also--

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.112
one of the products I'm
really focused on is offline

00:03:09.112 --> 00:03:11.070
and how do we make sure
that they have that map

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.455
data available to them if
they are in the basement

00:03:13.455 --> 00:03:15.987
or they are in some kind
of austere situation,

00:03:15.987 --> 00:03:17.570
where they don't
have any connectivity

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:18.370
to the outside world.

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:19.680
DYLAN THOMAS: Yeah, yeah, cool.

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.190
So I think it's something we
both heard from customers,

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.719
actually, is just the
consumerization piece doesn't

00:03:25.719 --> 00:03:28.010
just mean bringing the consumer
stuff to the enterprise

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.580
necessarily, but
the learning factor.

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.520
If I know how to use
Google Maps on my phone,

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.960
I kind of know how to use the
Coordinate app, for example,

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:36.310
right?

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.760
SEAN MADAY: Absolutely.

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.370
DYLAN THOMAS: It's just
pretty straightforward.

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:39.412
So you mentioned offline.

00:03:39.412 --> 00:03:40.328
This is a good segway.

00:03:40.328 --> 00:03:42.430
We've got a number of
questions from customers

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.000
who I mentioned
while talking to you,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.890
and the questions started
rolling in, so let's get to it.

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.200
SEAN MADAY: Sounds good.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.690
DYLAN THOMAS: The first one is
about Google Earth Enterprise,

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.700
which is a product you're
a product manager for.

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:54.470
SEAN MADAY: Absolutely.

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.803
DYLAN THOMAS: And how that
fits with Google Maps Engine?

00:03:56.803 --> 00:03:59.192
So how do the two
products look together?

00:03:59.192 --> 00:04:00.400
SEAN MADAY: Yeah, absolutely.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.220
That's a great question.

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.220
And so Google Earth
Enterprises, really Google's

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:04.700
first maps for business product.

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.660
It's been around
for eight years.

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.020
And we have just an extremely
loyal customer base,

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:10.850
who've done really interesting
things with technology.

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:11.641
DYLAN THOMAS: Yeah.

00:04:11.641 --> 00:04:13.220
SEAN MADAY: Google
Maps Engine is

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.959
kind of a new kid on the block,
but for the last couple years

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.250
Google has invested a
lot of time and resources

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.480
in the [? StandingUp, ?] a
very unique geospatial platform

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:23.765
that runs in Google's cloud.

00:04:23.765 --> 00:04:24.060
DYLAN THOMAS: OK.

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.960
SEAN MADAY: Same cloud that
provides YouTube and Gmail,

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:26.790
and those sorts of things.

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:27.330
DYLAN THOMAS: Yeah.

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:28.788
SEAN MADAY: So it's
really exciting

00:04:28.788 --> 00:04:30.810
for me, when I look at
these two technologies,

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:35.430
is that as we have now petabytes
of data and tens of terabytes

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.784
of data that customers may
have in their repository.

00:04:37.784 --> 00:04:39.200
They can go to
Google Maps Engine,

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.079
they can process that
off-loading or offloading

00:04:42.079 --> 00:04:43.620
that process that
they would normally

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.270
do on their own hardware,
they can now do in the cloud.

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:46.936
DYLAN THOMAS: All
right, got it, got it.

00:04:46.936 --> 00:04:50.840
So you're saying that
GEE of enterprise,

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.299
you've got the
processing component

00:04:52.299 --> 00:04:54.048
and then you've got
the serving component.

00:04:54.048 --> 00:04:56.520
And the processing component
is really compute intensive,

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.380
so with GME, you
could offload that

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:00.620
to Google's infrastructure?

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:01.220
SEAN MADAY: Absolutely.

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.310
And then maybe you have
some proprietary layers

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:05.320
that you know you just don't
want to share the cloud

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:06.950
or you legally can't
share with the cloud--

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:07.110
DYLAN THOMAS: OK.

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:09.193
SEAN MADAY: We are going
to give you tools on prem

00:05:09.193 --> 00:05:11.327
to make sure that you
process those, combine

00:05:11.327 --> 00:05:13.410
that with the data you
have in Google Maps Engine,

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:16.110
and there you have the
best of both worlds.

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:21.010
And so we see GME as an
integral piece of the GEE story,

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:22.994
and GEE as an integral
piece of the GME story.

00:05:22.994 --> 00:05:24.660
DYLAN THOMAS: Sounds
like one big story.

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:25.951
SEAN MADAY: It's one big story.

00:05:25.951 --> 00:05:26.620
It's a novel.

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:29.490
DYLAN THOMAS: It's a novel.

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:33.890
So other one was about GEE 5.0,
which is a pending release,

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:35.520
so I think you'd
maybe touch on a bit.

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.910
And actually, specifically
about WMS support,

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:41.419
which is the open standard
for sharing data, right?

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:43.710
SEAN MADAY: Yeah, I'm really
excited about this GEE 5.0

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:44.290
release.

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:46.610
We've had a ton of
great engineering effort

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:49.279
over the last nine months
or so to get this release

00:05:49.279 --> 00:05:50.070
and make it happen.

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:51.400
It's currently out
in the beta form,

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.236
so current customers can
download it and install it.

00:05:53.236 --> 00:05:53.950
DYLAN THOMAS: OK.

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:55.490
SEAN MADAY: And we're actually
pushing for a production

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:57.030
release on the 24th of October.

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:00.230
So really exciting to
have this on the horizon.

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:03.220
One feature-- there's many
very exciting features

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:06.042
that our team has worked on
here for this GEE 5.0 release--

00:06:06.042 --> 00:06:07.250
one of those features is WMS.

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:07.958
DYLAN THOMAS: OK.

00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.610
SEAN MADAY: And
our folks with WMS

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:12.920
was to give away
four of our customers

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:15.620
to take the imagery that they
have loaded into Google Earth

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:16.660
Enterprise, that
they're going to use

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:17.910
with Google Earth
and Google Maps--

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:18.450
DYLAN THOMAS: Yeah.

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:20.970
SEAN MADAY: --but also make
use of that imagery in some

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:23.717
of their GIS applications, or
remote sensing applications--

00:06:23.717 --> 00:06:25.800
DYLAN THOMAS: So like QGIS
or something like that?

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.750
SEAN MADAY: Sure, exactly,
ArcMap, QGIS, NASA World Wind.

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:31.210
A way that you could, from
a customer's perspective,

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:32.880
have one repository
of imagery that

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.450
could feed both
your Google Maps,

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:38.020
Google Earth, and
your OGC compliant

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:40.290
GIS software suite audiences.

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:42.170
DYLAN THOMAS: So speaking
of OGC compliance,

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:43.740
the question was
specifically asking

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:45.020
about versions around that.

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:46.700
I don't know how much you
can share on that today.

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:48.450
SEAN MADAY: Yes, so
it's a great question.

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:53.000
We are going to support WMS
1.1 and the 1.3 specs, so both

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.130
of those specs with the
standard kind of GetMap.

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:58.020
DYLAN THOMAS: Oh,
perfect, OK, great.

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:00.525
SEAN MADAY: Yeah, and
get image requests.

00:07:00.525 --> 00:07:01.330
DYLAN THOMAS: Yeah.

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:04.190
SEAN MADAY: And
then the tiles are

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:06.150
going to come out in
their native projection.

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:08.804
So if you're projecting
them from a Mercator map,

00:07:08.804 --> 00:07:10.345
those WMS tiles are
going to come out

00:07:10.345 --> 00:07:11.220
in Mercator projection.

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:11.928
DYLAN THOMAS: OK.

00:07:11.928 --> 00:07:15.950
SEAN MADAY: If you're pulling
the tiles from a 3D database,

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:18.190
they will be in the
[INAUDIBLE] projection

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:19.370
or the flat projection.

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:21.830
And so what we
then would envision

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:24.880
is that our customers can marry
this Google Earth Enterprise

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:27.820
5.0 offering with an open
source tool, like MapServer,

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:30.962
or an open source
utility like GeoServer,

00:07:30.962 --> 00:07:32.670
and they could do
cascading re-projection

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:34.560
to take these tiles they are
getting from Earth Enterprise

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:36.570
and re-project them into
any other projections

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:37.600
that their users may require.

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:39.183
DYLAN THOMAS: Oh,
OK, so the WMS piece

00:07:39.183 --> 00:07:41.970
we have is the OGC
compliant spec,

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:44.132
but then if you want
to do additional work,

00:07:44.132 --> 00:07:46.340
then you can just plug in
whatever open source server

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:49.762
you're interested in using to do
all extra magical stuff there?

00:07:49.762 --> 00:07:50.720
SEAN MADAY: Absolutely.

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:52.200
All those re-projection
use cases.

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:53.750
DYLAN THOMAS: Yeah, yeah, cool.

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:55.250
Thanks, let's move
onto another one.

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:55.330
SEAN MADAY: OK.

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:57.610
DYLAN THOMAS: Apparently, you
gave a presentation at ASPRS

00:07:57.610 --> 00:07:58.240
in Baltimore.

00:07:58.240 --> 00:07:58.580
SEAN MADAY: Oh.

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:00.920
DYLAN THOMAS: And someone saw
it and they have a question.

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:02.680
SEAN MADAY: Well, I don't want
to take too much credit here,

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:04.096
but when I presented
in Baltimore,

00:08:04.096 --> 00:08:06.442
the Ravens won the
Superbowl, so I

00:08:06.442 --> 00:08:07.900
think I have a lot
to do with that.

00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:09.191
DYLAN THOMAS: The effort, yeah.

00:08:09.191 --> 00:08:12.016
Well, moving on.

00:08:12.016 --> 00:08:14.140
I think the question there
was that you were really

00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:17.320
talking about offline and
taking things portable.

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:19.065
And touched on this.

00:08:19.065 --> 00:08:22.350
And so what the question is
can you share a little bit more

00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:23.940
about that project, generally?

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:25.940
What our approach is
in Maps for Business?

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:30.180
And then, also, to what extent
that moves to GME customers,

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:31.340
as well, from Apps Engine?

00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:32.548
SEAN MADAY: Yeah, absolutely.

00:08:32.548 --> 00:08:34.760
So I'm really excited
to be part of a team

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:37.360
right now that has been
working on the ability

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:39.849
to cut portable maps and
globes from Google Maps Engine.

00:08:39.849 --> 00:08:40.640
DYLAN THOMAS: Yeah.

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:43.014
SEAN MADAY: So you can take
all this data you've uploaded

00:08:43.014 --> 00:08:46.200
to the cloud, download it in
whole or maybe just a part

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:48.357
of it as it makes sense,
and then drop that--

00:08:48.357 --> 00:08:49.690
it comes down as a single file--

00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:49.790
DYLAN THOMAS: OK.

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:52.190
SEAN MADAY: You can drop that
file then on your laptop,

00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:54.157
run it with Google
Maps Engine Portable

00:08:54.157 --> 00:08:56.240
or very soon you are going
to be able to drop that

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:57.698
on your Android
device and interact

00:08:57.698 --> 00:08:59.105
with that map or that 3D globe--

00:08:59.105 --> 00:09:00.063
DYLAN THOMAS: Oh, cool.

00:09:00.063 --> 00:09:02.500
SEAN MADAY: --from a
tablet or a smartphone.

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:04.166
DYLAN THOMAS: So the
thing you mentioned

00:09:04.166 --> 00:09:06.210
there was Google Maps
Engine Portable being

00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:09.460
the sort of the file format and
the serving technology there?

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:11.670
SEAN MADAY: Yeah, so we
call those "portable cuts."

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:13.690
It's kind of in the
file format, and then we

00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:16.500
have a flexible suite
of serving solutions.

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:19.190
So whether it's a
single Android device,

00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:21.720
maybe it's laptop portable in
a small tactical operations

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:24.256
center or a small group
kind of environment;

00:09:24.256 --> 00:09:25.880
or even Google Earth
Enterprise Server,

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:27.720
if you need to serve
thousands of users,

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:30.370
you can cut that imagery
terrain and vector data out

00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:32.490
of Google Maps Engine,
drop that file, which

00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:35.310
could be very large, on your
Google For Enterprise server,

00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:37.769
serve it to everybody behind
your firewall on your network.

00:09:37.769 --> 00:09:40.060
DYLAN THOMAS: So I think that
sort of comes full circle

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:41.785
to what you were
talking about initially,

00:09:41.785 --> 00:09:44.370
where you could
potentially offload

00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:47.590
the compute-intensive
processing of data, what

00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:50.450
you might consider
the fusing of data.

00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:52.520
And then the offline
component, it's actually,

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:55.045
it's what Google Earth
Enterprises today-- except,

00:09:55.045 --> 00:09:57.420
we now have a really nice
story with MapsEngine and Earth

00:09:57.420 --> 00:09:57.750
Enterprise--

00:09:57.750 --> 00:09:58.080
SEAN MADAY: Absolutely.

00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:59.970
DYLAN THOMAS: --and
we're adding the ability

00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:03.872
to not just use GEE server,
but also some new technology.

00:10:03.872 --> 00:10:04.830
SEAN MADAY: Absolutely.

00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:06.830
DYLAN THOMAS: Very
nice, OK, thanks.

00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:08.490
We have one other question.

00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:10.990
It was, what is the
anticipated impacts

00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:14.239
to previous versions of
GEE databases and globes

00:10:14.239 --> 00:10:15.030
in the new version?

00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:16.321
Basically, an upgrade question.

00:10:16.321 --> 00:10:17.250
What's the impact?

00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:17.870
SEAN MADAY: Yeah, absolutely.

00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:19.453
We're keenly interested
in making sure

00:10:19.453 --> 00:10:22.442
that our customers can
upgrade seamlessly to GEE 5.0.

00:10:22.442 --> 00:10:23.150
DYLAN THOMAS: OK.

00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:25.108
SEAN MADAY: So with the
release that we put out

00:10:25.108 --> 00:10:28.480
on the 24th of October, we
will have an upgrade guide.

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:31.560
And we've run several different
upgrade scenarios internally

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:35.770
just to make sure that whether
you're upgrading directly

00:10:35.770 --> 00:10:39.570
from 4.4 or 4.4.1
to 5.0, we have

00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:41.660
good options and good
instructions for you.

00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:43.820
Generally, it's going to require
rebuilding the Google Earth

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:44.475
Enterprise database.

00:10:44.475 --> 00:10:45.040
DYLAN THOMAS: OK.

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:46.498
SEAN MADAY: And in
some cases, it's

00:10:46.498 --> 00:10:50.546
going to require building
the project-level assets.

00:10:50.546 --> 00:10:51.920
DYLAN THOMAS: OK,
and so when you

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:53.650
say "in some cases," that's
all in the documentation

00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:55.240
you just described, sort of
the upgrade guide, right?

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:56.073
SEAN MADAY: Exactly.

00:10:56.073 --> 00:10:59.620
Yeah, and of course, we have
our Enterprise support folks

00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:01.320
are always there
to help, if there's

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:05.850
specific questions or unique
environment questions,

00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:08.705
jump on the Enterprise
Support Portal, file a ticket,

00:11:08.705 --> 00:11:10.524
[INAUDIBLE] and the
team, and my team

00:11:10.524 --> 00:11:12.690
will work really hard to
make sure our customers can

00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:13.700
make this transition.

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:14.150
DYLAN THOMAS: Great.

00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:15.320
I'm glad you mentioned that.

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:16.695
I know I've
mentioned she's going

00:11:16.695 --> 00:11:19.490
to be doing a bit more of a
deep dive on what's new in 5.0.

00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:21.540
We'll be recording and
releasing that later.

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:24.780
But for now, Sean, thanks very
much, indeed, for joining us.

00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:24.980
SEAN MADAY: Oh, that you, Dylan.

00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:26.271
DYLAN THOMAS: We appreciate it.

00:11:26.271 --> 00:11:27.740
And that's it for this time.

00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:31.260
We'll see you next time
on "Behind the Map."
