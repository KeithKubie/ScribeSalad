MAN: Time to get things

00:00:04.804 --> 00:00:09.409
Right now what I want to do is
work on the roof of my shelter

00:00:09.409 --> 00:00:12.812
to make sure it's
nice and strong,

00:00:12.812 --> 00:00:16.383
because when I have
three feet of snowfall,

00:00:16.383 --> 00:00:21.354
I do not want a flimsy tarp
being the only thing holding up

00:00:21.354 --> 00:00:22.589
the roof.

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:27.460
I need to add some skeletal
infrastructure to it,

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.765
so that it can take a little bit
of weight when the time comes.

00:00:34.667 --> 00:00:41.541
Unfortunately, my bowels are
still not kicking anything out.

00:00:41.541 --> 00:00:44.844
I'm getting worried,
because I'm having really

00:00:44.844 --> 00:00:47.881
bad issues with my intestines.

00:00:47.881 --> 00:00:54.721
Feels like I've got stomach
cramping and abdominal pain.

00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:56.322
The rules of this
thing are simple.

00:00:56.322 --> 00:01:00.927
If you ask for help from the
crew, you have tapped out.

00:01:00.927 --> 00:01:03.797
They can't come in and give
me a laxative and be like,

00:01:03.797 --> 00:01:07.267
there you go, bud,
anything else?

00:01:07.267 --> 00:01:10.370
They absolutely
have to either wait

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.639
for me to tap out,
or medically pull

00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:16.176
me, or wait for me to poop.

00:01:16.176 --> 00:01:20.013
So that sits real
nicely up on there.

00:01:20.013 --> 00:01:24.651
I never, in my
wildest imagination,

00:01:24.651 --> 00:01:27.620
thought that one poop
could get in the way

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.591
from my family having a
house and a car that doesn't

00:01:31.591 --> 00:01:36.362
break down, but it just has.

00:01:36.362 --> 00:01:40.934
So at the moment, I'm basically
finished with this ceiling.

00:01:40.934 --> 00:01:44.771
Anytime I'm cutting little, thin
saplings and I get a new one,

00:01:44.771 --> 00:01:47.440
I can just interweave it, and
it's just going to get stronger

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.742
and stronger as we go along.

00:01:49.742 --> 00:01:51.244
So I love it.

00:01:51.244 --> 00:01:52.145
I'm going to keep it this way.

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.186
The only thing in my head
right now is the fact

00:02:00.186 --> 00:02:02.288
that if I don't go to
the bathroom-- like,

00:02:02.288 --> 00:02:07.594
if I don't have a bowel
movement in the next few days,

00:02:07.594 --> 00:02:11.731
I'm going to be medically
pulled, and I won't get to win,

00:02:11.731 --> 00:02:15.335
and I won't get to
provide for my family.

00:02:15.335 --> 00:02:18.771
I feel like I've put in
so much work out here.

00:02:18.771 --> 00:02:20.707
I feel like I want to
make it the long haul.

00:02:23.843 --> 00:02:29.082
I don't want to have to go
home from this empty-handed.
