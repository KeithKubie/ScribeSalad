00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.230
Okay. Hopefully you picked dish soap. We're going to add just a squeeze of

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:08.507
this here, into the water. We're going to

00:00:08.507 --> 00:00:10.156
take some of the meat tenderizer. We're

00:00:10.156 --> 00:00:14.690
going to add that too. Just a sprinkling of it. Now what I'm going to

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:19.234
do, is I'm going to take my fork, and I'm actually going to start mashing up.

00:00:19.234 --> 00:00:20.120
[SOUND].

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.460
And what you want to do is mash the strawberries

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.405
up really well, and you want to mix it up.

00:00:26.405 --> 00:00:27.720
[SOUND].

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.990
And what you're doing is breaking down the strawberry

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.870
tissue, at the same time you're helping rice the

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.450
cells open, break them open, with the soap and

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.500
the meat tenderizer. Now, we're going to add one other ingredient

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.680
right now. We're going to add the salt. The salt's

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.140
going to come into play later when we need to precipitate

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.370
DNA. It turns out DNA has a charge to

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.760
it. And it wants to stay in solution with water.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.000
But if we add a little salt when we get to

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.680
precipitation step of alcohol. It'll come out a solution a lot

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.890
easier. So you want to add just a little bit of

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.770
salt, maybe a teaspoon, and then we're going to mix it

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.590
all up again. Continually mashing to break up big chunks of

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.180
tissue, and hopefully our soap and our meat tenderizer will do

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.830
the rest. Okay, so once you've got it nice and mixed

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.020
you'll remember that our second step is that we want to break

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.390
down the protein. And our meat tenderizer's going to do

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:21.840
that in the warm water, but we need to

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.940
give it time to work. So what I want to

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.558
do is, we want to set the timer for about

00:01:26.558 --> 00:01:28.069
[SOUND]

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:33.258
three minutes. And while the timer's going, we're

00:01:33.258 --> 00:01:38.289
going to keep mashing, and keep swirling. Okay, it's been three

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:43.872
minutes. Mm. Smells kind of good. If you had

00:01:43.872 --> 00:01:46.130
to guess, what do you think it smells like?
