00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.340
- Good morning, I hope
you're having an amazing day.

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:03.173
It's Mark Wiens.

00:00:03.173 --> 00:00:04.690
I'm in Tashkent, Uzbekistan

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:06.330
and we just arrived about four,

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.823
we landed at the airport
about four hours ago.

00:00:09.903 --> 00:00:11.260
So this is my first time to visit.

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:12.800
I'm excited to be here.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.130
Today we are gonna go on an Uzbekistan,

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:17.370
Tashkent Uzbek food tour.

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:18.670
I'm gonna meet up with Bekruz.

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:19.890
He's the one who invited us here

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.210
with the Ministry of Tourism.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.650
This is gonna be my very first day

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.780
to ever eat Uzbekistan food,

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:27.363
and I'm gonna share it all
with you in this video.

00:00:27.363 --> 00:00:29.946
(upbeat music)

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.210
- [Mark] Hi, man.
- [Woman] Good morning.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.310
- How are you?
- [Mark] Good, how are you?

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:38.283
- Welcome to Tashkent man.

00:00:38.283 --> 00:00:40.530
- He's an awesome food blogger here.

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:41.910
And Akbar?
- Akbar.

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.510
- We are on our way to start eating.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.093
(upbeat music)

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.910
- [Man] Yep, this is where
we're gonna have breakfast,

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:55.743
and walk around today.

00:00:55.743 --> 00:00:57.017
- We are in Chagatai.

00:00:57.017 --> 00:00:59.960
Chagatai, is the heart of the whole city,

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.750
and all the people within Tashkent,

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.580
especially, they come
exclusively for bread.

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:07.870
- I can smell the bread already.

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:08.810
- Exactly, right!

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.735
- We're starting off for breakfast here,

00:01:10.735 --> 00:01:14.474
and this is an entire
Bazaar dedicated to bread.

00:01:14.474 --> 00:01:16.470
And just the aroma of the
bread smells incredible.

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.060
You can see the sesame seeds.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.800
They're like these giant rings of bread.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.380
They almost look like baby carriages,

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.390
that they roll the bread in.

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:27.830
Babies of bread.

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:29.100
That smell, I just can't wait to taste it.

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.260
It smells so good.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.860
Two words to learn when
you come to Uzbekistan,

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.780
Assalomu Alaykum, which is hello.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:35.790
It's just a greeting,

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.330
which is similar to Arabic,

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:38.163
and rasmat?

00:01:38.163 --> 00:01:39.410
- [Bekruz] Rahmat.
Rahmat.

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.700
Rahmat means thank you.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.570
So those the words we're gonna be using

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.820
throughout this trip in Uzbekistan.

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.450
We're gonna gather some
things for breakfast and

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.283
have my very first
breakfast in Uzbekistan.

00:01:52.283 --> 00:01:54.583
Assalomu Alaykum.

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:57.050
- [Bekruz] You see?

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.647
So early morning they milk the cow.

00:02:00.647 --> 00:02:01.521
- Assalomu alaykum!

00:02:01.521 --> 00:02:02.354
Assalomu alaykum!

00:02:02.354 --> 00:02:04.017
- Yeah, we got a little portion of

00:02:04.017 --> 00:02:05.492
(speaks foreign language).

00:02:05.492 --> 00:02:07.160
I made sure that it's very fresh.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.993
- [Mark] Great.

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.220
- This is called (speaks foreign language)

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.870
which means beans.

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.640
And you can see the
carrot fried with the oil.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.117
And you see (speaks foreign language).

00:02:19.264 --> 00:02:20.264
Usually minced meat.

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:23.343
- Oh wow.

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:27.340
You can't smell that.

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.803
Like the honey, yeah.

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:32.522
Rahmat.

00:02:33.611 --> 00:02:34.444
Rahmat.

00:02:34.444 --> 00:02:36.990
Oh it's so juicy!

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.830
The aroma!

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.553
Oh it's so fragrant!

00:02:45.315 --> 00:02:46.148
Oh wow!

00:02:48.886 --> 00:02:50.960
That has to be the juiciest
melon I've ever tasted!

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.270
And so like honey.

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.033
That's crazy juicy, huh?

00:02:56.141 --> 00:02:59.260
Mmm it's like drinking
an entire cup of juice

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.944
in every single bite.

00:03:00.944 --> 00:03:03.527
(upbeat music)

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.180
We bought all the stuff at the market and

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.090
then we walk over right
next door to the market,

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:17.640
there's a it's a restaurant but

00:03:18.813 --> 00:03:20.560
it's also a community gathering space.

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.330
If you can notice we're
actually sitting above a stream.

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.423
A small river that flows underneath us.

00:03:26.423 --> 00:03:29.290
Oh man, you can smell the
onions and the carrots.

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:30.123
That bread.

00:03:30.123 --> 00:03:30.956
The grapes.

00:03:30.956 --> 00:03:34.042
Kaymak, everything we're about to dig in

00:03:34.042 --> 00:03:35.292
for this breakfast feast.

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:37.923
- [Bekruz] Oh yeah it's so huge.

00:03:37.923 --> 00:03:39.930
It's so big so we can see all the layers.

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.494
We can see the dough.

00:03:41.494 --> 00:03:44.670
(speaks foreign language)
Yeah, yeah the best bread

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.280
is cooked in (speaks foreign language).

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:51.010
- Good. (laughs)

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:52.073
- [Mark] I'm gonna grab
some of the bread and

00:03:52.073 --> 00:03:53.960
wow, that's actually really dense bread.

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:56.510
We've all got our own bowls of the kaymak.

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:58.833
So you kinda just dip it in.

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:01.620
Very thick and creamy.

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.863
- Viva kaymak! (laughs)

00:04:06.055 --> 00:04:07.388
- Oh wow!
- Good?

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:11.245
- The bread is so fresh and

00:04:11.245 --> 00:04:13.330
then the kaymak is like a really creamy,

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:17.130
almost like whipped butter
in taste and texture.

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:18.230
Wash it down with tea.

00:04:20.803 --> 00:04:22.629
Ahh, oh yeah.

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:23.800
Just soothing.

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.390
It just goes so well.

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:27.090
Dip into some more of this kaymak.

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:30.593
- [Man] These are different,

00:04:30.593 --> 00:04:31.426
there's two types.

00:04:31.426 --> 00:04:33.503
Yellow and we have another one.

00:04:34.781 --> 00:04:37.131
What you do is you just
break it up like a jam.

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:41.756
(Mark laughing)

00:04:41.756 --> 00:04:42.992
- [Mark] And a little on your pants.

00:04:42.992 --> 00:04:44.720
Alright I'm gonna try one of the figs.

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:45.933
Break it in half.

00:04:46.916 --> 00:04:49.730
I can just feel the
juices just squeezing out.

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:50.570
Oh wow.

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:51.570
Squeeze it together.

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:54.140
Squeeze it together.

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:55.880
And yeah you can see like the pulpiness

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.320
just kinda and the sugars
just coming together.

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.000
Squeeze it together and

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.940
that just brings out the
juices and the natural.

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:08.229
That's just natural jam in fruit skin.

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:10.812
(upbeat music)

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:15.190
Just crazy good.

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.070
It is, it's like pudding.

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:19.740
So you can see it's
like a very thin dough.

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.781
And then you can see that.

00:05:21.781 --> 00:05:25.003
She smeared on this mixture
of minced meat and carrot.

00:05:29.508 --> 00:05:30.341
That is just delicious.

00:05:30.341 --> 00:05:32.110
That's almost like a carrot jam,

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:37.057
smeared within this savory thin dough.

00:05:37.057 --> 00:05:40.890
- (speaking foreign language)

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:47.670
- It's just the beginning.

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:49.453
It is just the breakfast.

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:58.000
- That was a fantastic way to
start this Tashkent food tour.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.550
Yeah the bread in the
morning is so soothing.

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:01.920
Oh man and that fruit.

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:02.760
So sweet.

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:03.850
So juicy.

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:05.520
We are moving on.

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:09.690
I think we're going to one of
the main biggest bazaars now,

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:12.810
to eat a few signature dishes.

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:14.711
Buh-bye!
- Buh-bye!

00:06:14.711 --> 00:06:17.294
(upbeat music)

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:22.650
We just drove down the
road to Chorsu Bazaar.

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:24.110
This is the biggest and the oldest

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:27.090
bazaar market place in Tashkent.

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:27.923
We're gonna walk around here.

00:06:27.923 --> 00:06:30.230
We're gonna eat some
more food and especially,

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:32.050
- You can even see the smoke.

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:33.790
- Oh yeah on the outskirts of the market

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:35.020
people are selling things like

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:36.910
melons, peanuts,

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:38.563
nuts, dried fruit.

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:42.360
We're moving into the smoke.

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.460
I can smell the meat.

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:44.954
- You can smell the meat.

00:06:44.954 --> 00:06:45.787
It's a beef,

00:06:45.787 --> 00:06:46.620
it's a kebab.

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:48.840
There's a lot of things going on here.

00:06:50.573 --> 00:06:53.615
(women speaking foreign language)

00:06:53.615 --> 00:06:54.730
- There's so many unique things.

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:55.940
Check out this sausage.

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:57.220
There's meat grilling.

00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:58.440
I mean there's such a mix.

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:00.840
Such an influence from so
many different places because

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:03.150
Uzbekistan is on the silk road and so

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:04.300
there's such a mix of influence.

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:08.495
But there's so many unique
things in this region as well.

00:07:08.495 --> 00:07:10.395
Assalomu aleykum.

00:07:10.395 --> 00:07:11.280
Oh this is the samsa here?

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:13.173
- Made samsa.
Ahh, okay.

00:07:14.037 --> 00:07:16.740
- Okay. (laughs)

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:17.840
- So this is the spot.

00:07:19.648 --> 00:07:21.510
So the Chorsu has many
varieties of the food.

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:23.260
Local people if you pay attention there,

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:24.430
they come and eat.

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:27.157
This is what it is.

00:07:27.157 --> 00:07:30.060
- She has been making
this dish for 25 years

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:31.130
right here at the market.

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:32.810
It's kind of like a lasagna but

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:34.120
you can see it's tomato sauce,

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.890
but at the same time it's
almost like a dumpling because

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:38.390
there's like little self
contained little pockets.

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:40.960
She puts it onto the plate.

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:42.150
She scoops on it looks like

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:43.870
onions and dill onto the top and

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:45.110
with a chili on the side.

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:47.410
And then this is kind of
a big food court section.

00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:48.930
It's packed right now.

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:50.600
We're coming to the
back here to sample it.

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:51.890
Big communal tables.

00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:54.610
You can smell the aroma of the smoke.

00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:55.683
Oh this is beautiful.

00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:58.700
We've got two little dumplings,

00:07:58.700 --> 00:07:59.990
and they're topped with onions.

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:02.170
And you can smell the dill.

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:04.040
I would love to taste this chili too.

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:05.670
Maybe chase it with a chili.

00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:07.810
But I wil open one of these guys.

00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:09.113
Get some of the onions.

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:13.120
Look at that inside of it.

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:14.330
Oh what's on the inside?

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:16.800
Kinda like matchstick cut potatoes,

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:18.936
which are filled onto the inside.

00:08:18.936 --> 00:08:21.519
(all laughing)

00:08:24.837 --> 00:08:26.150
Thank you very much.

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:27.860
- We call it, Doppler.
- Doppler.

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:30.280
- It has actually a very
really good meaning.

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:32.300
If you can give me for one
moment I'll explain you.

00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:33.133
- Yeah, sure.

00:08:34.381 --> 00:08:36.230
- So this is a chili sign.

00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:38.350
Chili pepper sign.
- Oh! Chili pepper sign!

00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:42.623
- Yeah the sign says it
protects from the evil eye.

00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:46.330
The chili sign from four sides,

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:48.610
Uzbek man used to wear them so

00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:52.494
they are protected from
evil eye from all sides.

00:08:52.494 --> 00:08:53.683
We call it, Doppler.

00:08:53.683 --> 00:08:55.074
Traditional doppler.

00:08:55.074 --> 00:08:56.158
And we wear it like that.

00:08:56.158 --> 00:08:57.502
- Yes.

00:08:57.502 --> 00:08:59.430
So do you wear it to the side
or do you wear it to the,

00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:00.380
- However you like.

00:09:02.536 --> 00:09:03.650
It looks good.

00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:05.890
- Okay that's even better with the chili,

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:07.290
the chilis.

00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:08.475
Thank you very much.

00:09:08.475 --> 00:09:09.308
Back to the dumplings and

00:09:09.308 --> 00:09:11.473
yeah you can see they
are filled with potato.

00:09:16.657 --> 00:09:18.634
- [Bekruz] It's burst of flavors.

00:09:18.634 --> 00:09:19.467
- You've got the gummy wrapper.

00:09:19.467 --> 00:09:20.500
You've got the potatoes in there.

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:22.010
Part tomato sauce,

00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:24.010
and then the crispy onions and the dill.

00:09:27.838 --> 00:09:28.671
Chew it up.

00:09:28.671 --> 00:09:30.880
Make sure you chew it up well.

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:31.713
Oh yeah.

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:34.393
So good, so good.

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:36.273
I love it yeah.

00:09:36.273 --> 00:09:37.790
That goes up your nose a little bit.

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:38.623
Oh it's wonderful and

00:09:38.623 --> 00:09:40.913
it's just very maybe very lightly pickled.

00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:44.630
Oh what do we have next?

00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:45.510
It's so solid.

00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:47.830
It's so like dense.

00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:50.030
You can feel like kind
of a crusty oiliness.

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:53.940
I'm not even sure what's on the inside.

00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:57.511
Oh there's meat and kind
of like a lump in there.

00:09:57.511 --> 00:09:59.930
- This is a fat and this is a,

00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:01.413
this is a lamb fat.

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:06.330
Our sheep has big butts. (laughs)

00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:08.740
- This is a next level samsa.

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:10.560
I'm gonna try to get

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:12.720
a little bit of that fat into this bite.

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:14.823
And okay let me navigate my bite.

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:22.233
Whoa!

00:10:26.798 --> 00:10:29.287
Whoa, that just melts with,

00:10:29.287 --> 00:10:31.940
that's just pure lamb oil.

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:32.773
It just melts.

00:10:32.773 --> 00:10:34.534
You taste a little bit
of spice in there like,

00:10:34.534 --> 00:10:38.140
a little bit of cumin
but just liquid lamb.

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:40.060
I mean that's just a
live jiggly piece of fat.

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:41.260
But wow!

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.640
That is umami flavor at its best.

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:45.213
Oh it just fell out.

00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:47.300
Oh I gotta save it!

00:10:48.452 --> 00:10:51.035
(upbeat music)

00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:56.290
- She liked how much you liked it.

00:10:56.290 --> 00:10:59.030
And she's refusing to get money.

00:10:59.030 --> 00:11:00.450
She's saying it's on me.

00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:02.410
I like the way they like.

00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:03.350
They are guests.

00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:04.183
We respect.

00:11:04.183 --> 00:11:06.030
So this is the true hospitality.

00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:06.990
- Rahmat. Rahmat.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:08.933
Oh man and just,

00:11:08.933 --> 00:11:13.400
we have been now in Tashkent Uzbekistan

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:16.160
for a total of like 12 hours,

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:18.990
and so far everybody that we've met

00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:20.560
has been so friendly,

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:21.650
so generous,

00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:22.933
so hospitable.

00:11:24.324 --> 00:11:25.870
It's a beautiful culture.

00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:28.060
That food was incredibly good.

00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:29.210
When you come to the market here,

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:31.110
when you come to the bazaar,

00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:31.943
come to meet her.

00:11:31.943 --> 00:11:34.823
She is an amazing lady.

00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:37.620
- This is all cheese.

00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:39.115
We call it, kurt.

00:11:39.115 --> 00:11:41.970
Even with a bit of yogurt it's a cheese.

00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:43.100
So it's very tender.

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:45.000
I believe you may get it.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.353
- It has a little bit of a
yogurt cheese aroma to it.

00:11:51.723 --> 00:11:53.180
Mmm!

00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:54.620
Oh wow!

00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:57.080
Oh that's delicious.

00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:58.460
It's sour.

00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:00.030
It tastes like yogurt but it's salty.

00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:02.250
Condensed and almost like yolky.

00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:04.060
- Our local recipe.

00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:05.370
It's really nice.

00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:06.220
You gotta try it.

00:12:07.407 --> 00:12:09.339
(upbeat music)

00:12:09.339 --> 00:12:10.600
- Mmm!

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:12.143
I immediately taste the basil.

00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:15.170
And then that's like a crunchy,

00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:16.610
it's like rock yogurt.

00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:17.443
But like whoa!

00:12:19.777 --> 00:12:22.616
(upbeat music)

00:12:22.616 --> 00:12:25.483
This whole part is still the bazaar.

00:12:25.483 --> 00:12:27.130
Like the outside area indoor section.

00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:28.337
- That sign is the,

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:33.613
This lemon grown in Tashkent.

00:12:38.445 --> 00:12:40.100
Mmm!

00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:41.839
Ahh!
(Mark laughing)

00:12:41.839 --> 00:12:42.889
It's very refreshing.

00:12:42.889 --> 00:12:47.889
Try it.

00:12:50.517 --> 00:12:51.350
- Mmm.

00:12:52.207 --> 00:12:53.577
Mmm!

00:12:53.577 --> 00:12:55.653
Oh the juiciness.

00:12:55.653 --> 00:12:58.290
(laughs) That's just like a pool.

00:12:58.290 --> 00:13:00.100
A puddle of lemon juice.

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:01.080
The skin was kinda thick.

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:02.860
More leathery than I thought.

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:03.860
Oh yeah that's sour.

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:08.588
(laughs) Oh, sorry!

00:13:08.588 --> 00:13:10.729
- This is shot of mulberry juice.

00:13:10.729 --> 00:13:13.330
Even though it doesn't contain alcohol,

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:15.733
it will warm us in the friendship.

00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:19.749
Maybe Brudershaft.

00:13:19.749 --> 00:13:22.356
- (laughs) Okay.
Okay.

00:13:22.356 --> 00:13:23.457
- (laughing) This is mulberry.

00:13:23.457 --> 00:13:24.290
A shot of fresh mulberry juice.

00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:25.200
- In a bazaar.

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:28.357
One, two, go.
(upbeat music)

00:13:31.325 --> 00:13:32.908
- Oh oh oh!
- Oh oh!

00:13:33.934 --> 00:13:35.684
- Oh it's incredible!

00:13:36.568 --> 00:13:39.210
Maybe also because we had
that lemon in our mouth,

00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:41.020
it like magnifies the flavor.

00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:42.200
Perfectly sweet, sour.

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:44.815
That was really really good.

00:13:44.815 --> 00:13:45.648
Rahmat.

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:49.030
We really are here at one of
the best times in Uzbekistan

00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:50.500
because it's fruit season and so

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:51.333
everything is fresh.

00:13:51.333 --> 00:13:52.870
And there's just mountains of raspberries,

00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:54.510
and grapes and figs.

00:13:54.510 --> 00:13:55.750
Whereas if you come here in different,

00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:57.000
like winter for instance,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.560
well people buy the
fresh fruit now and then

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:02.590
they preserve them for
periods of cold when

00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:04.120
you cannot get the fresh fruits.

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:06.493
So it's great to be here at this time.

00:14:06.493 --> 00:14:08.830
I just see the abundance and

00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:11.370
the vibrancy of the natural ingredients.

00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:14.560
We've emerged from the fruits
and vegetables section to

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:17.380
one of the most iconic
sites of the bazaar,

00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:19.860
which is a dome shaped structure which

00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:20.693
we're gonna go inside.

00:14:20.693 --> 00:14:21.690
We're gonna see inside.

00:14:21.690 --> 00:14:23.420
And what I like also
about this bazaar is that

00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:24.300
you know it's busy,

00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:25.133
it's vibrant,

00:14:25.133 --> 00:14:26.320
but at the same time,

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:28.230
it's still calm and friendly and

00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:30.080
I mean people are so friendly.

00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:31.887
You still have space to breathe and

00:14:31.887 --> 00:14:34.343
walk around and roam around.

00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:39.610
As soon as we entered the dome,

00:14:39.610 --> 00:14:41.540
you can smell the aroma of the fresh meat,

00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:43.600
and this is the meat
section of this dome but

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:44.433
it's so cool.

00:14:44.433 --> 00:14:45.290
You step inside.

00:14:45.290 --> 00:14:47.670
The design is almost
like a web on the dome,

00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:49.670
and then there's an opening at the top.

00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:51.650
It's designed this way for the heat,

00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:53.460
but also just as an icon.

00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:56.040
It's so spacious also because
of the height of the dome,

00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:58.734
and you can hear just kind of echoing.

00:14:58.734 --> 00:14:59.822
Assalomu aleykum!

00:14:59.822 --> 00:15:01.880
I don't think I've ever
seen raw meat being sold

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:03.340
in such a cool,

00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:05.850
such a like museum like structure.

00:15:05.850 --> 00:15:07.109
It's beautiful.

00:15:07.109 --> 00:15:07.942
- It is the meat.

00:15:07.942 --> 00:15:10.973
Most of our cuisine is
based on the lamb so,

00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:13.730
we need the fresh supply of the meat.

00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:14.610
So I don't know,

00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:16.400
tons and tons of lamb comes here,

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:18.706
and everyday they sell it out.

00:15:18.706 --> 00:15:22.373
(speaking foreign language)

00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:27.620
- Oh those are the spices you can smell.

00:15:30.507 --> 00:15:32.690
Wow. And then we just came up the stairs,

00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:36.770
and check out this view
of the market floor.

00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:38.440
It almost looks like a,

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:39.930
you know what it reminds me of?

00:15:39.930 --> 00:15:42.530
It reminds me of like a stock exchange.

00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:43.720
It's like a stock exchange.

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:46.060
It's so, it really is.

00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:47.960
This has to be one of the
coolest markets in the world.

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:49.550
It feels like you're in a museum,

00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:50.760
and yet it's live.

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:53.540
It's a living museum of food.

00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:54.884
It's beautiful.

00:15:54.884 --> 00:15:57.467
(upbeat music)

00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:08.490
We're heading out of the market and

00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:09.780
we gotta rush a little bit because

00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:11.350
we're going to this lunch spot where

00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:13.900
we're gonna see they serve a huge,

00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:17.773
what is probably the national
dish food of Uzbekistan.

00:16:19.138 --> 00:16:20.173
So yeah it's perfect.

00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:24.203
Back into the van.

00:16:24.203 --> 00:16:27.577
We're on our way to
the TV Tower for lunch.

00:16:27.577 --> 00:16:30.160
(upbeat music)

00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:33.832
- Yeah everyone is for plov.

00:16:33.832 --> 00:16:34.665
Every, those cars.

00:16:34.665 --> 00:16:35.498
- [Mark] All of these cars here?

00:16:35.498 --> 00:16:36.331
- All of those cars.

00:16:37.269 --> 00:16:38.810
Even our national football team, look!

00:16:38.810 --> 00:16:42.330
Our national football team
is coming to eat plov.

00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:44.456
- [Mark] That's the
national football team?

00:16:44.456 --> 00:16:45.453
- Yes, there we go.

00:16:45.453 --> 00:16:47.210
They are having lunch.

00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:48.600
- Literally for the last kilometer,

00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:50.440
we've been passing cars parked
on the side of the street.

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:53.710
They are all coming to eat
what we're about to eat.

00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:54.770
That's the national dish.

00:16:54.770 --> 00:16:55.693
- It is national.

00:16:57.975 --> 00:16:58.990
Plov is a wedding.

00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:00.530
Plov is a baby.

00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:01.650
Plov is a birthday.

00:17:01.650 --> 00:17:02.610
Plov is everything!

00:17:02.610 --> 00:17:05.670
Any occasion we have we want to celebrate,

00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:07.110
we celebrate with a plov.

00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:08.280
- That's all you need to know.

00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:10.190
Come to the base of the TV Tower.

00:17:10.190 --> 00:17:11.223
- It's almost over.

00:17:14.871 --> 00:17:16.290
- I can't even call that a pan or a pot.

00:17:16.290 --> 00:17:17.123
It's like a,

00:17:17.123 --> 00:17:21.611
it literally is a swimming pool of plov.

00:17:21.611 --> 00:17:22.444
It's almost finished.

00:17:22.444 --> 00:17:23.660
There's a little bit of oil at the bottom.

00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:25.610
And by a little bit of oil that's like a,

00:17:25.610 --> 00:17:27.440
that's like a tub of oil at the bottom.

00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:29.530
And then you're still
scooping out some of the rice.

00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:30.690
- See there was a big one,

00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:32.263
and unfortunately it ran out.

00:17:35.604 --> 00:17:38.043
- Still it's just like a bathtub
instead of a swimming pool.

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:40.220
There's lamb.

00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:41.500
I put it on a plate and over there

00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:42.333
they're chopping up the meat.

00:17:42.333 --> 00:17:45.090
And it looks like you kinda
get into a cuing system.

00:17:45.090 --> 00:17:46.160
You order your plov,

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:47.030
you order your plates,

00:17:47.030 --> 00:17:48.140
and then they dish it out for you.

00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:49.963
Smells unbelievable.

00:17:50.918 --> 00:17:55.168
(people speaking foreign language)

00:17:57.940 --> 00:18:01.260
If you could smell the
meat aroma back here.

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:03.310
It is, my nostrils are just,

00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:07.213
I can actually like feel a
layer of meat on my nostrils.

00:18:09.670 --> 00:18:10.503
- Look at it.

00:18:10.503 --> 00:18:13.190
So there is like three portions in one.

00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:15.430
This is for three people.

00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:17.440
So you see this is a qazi.

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:18.563
This is horse meat.

00:18:19.901 --> 00:18:20.860
- [Mark] It's the horse sausage?

00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:21.693
- Exactly.

00:18:21.693 --> 00:18:23.379
And we have a quail boiled egg.

00:18:23.379 --> 00:18:24.370
We have ordinary egg.

00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:26.770
And you see just the pile of the meat.

00:18:26.770 --> 00:18:29.030
I think more meat than rice itself.

00:18:29.030 --> 00:18:31.220
- I can't thin of another
word other than epic.

00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:33.473
Epic food adventure.

00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:38.480
Wow, huge. (laughs)

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:42.778
Everybody in here is
eating what we just saw.

00:18:42.778 --> 00:18:44.930
There's for sure 1,000 people in here.

00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:47.570
It's a huge dining hall area.

00:18:47.570 --> 00:18:49.520
Oh, are we going upstairs?

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:52.360
We're gonna sit upstairs so
we have a view of everybody.

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:53.560
And how many thousands kilos

00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:55.760
did you say of plov they serve here?

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:58.070
1.5 tons,
- Altogether?

00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:59.000
- Altogether.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.900
During the lunch time in two hours.

00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:01.910
Look at it.

00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:02.743
And it's gone.

00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:07.190
Usually we eat from one so it's

00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:09.290
a community kind of thing.

00:19:09.290 --> 00:19:11.124
I hope it's okay with you.

00:19:11.124 --> 00:19:11.957
- It's very okay for us.

00:19:11.957 --> 00:19:14.310
It's like a equal ratio of meat to rice.

00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:17.510
- Bahramad.
- Bahramad! Bon appetite.

00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:19.210
First bite usually the elder begins,

00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:20.340
and then guests and then

00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:21.180
we can all dig in.

00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:22.013
But the meat.

00:19:22.013 --> 00:19:22.846
You got the rice.

00:19:22.846 --> 00:19:23.679
It's so fluffy.

00:19:23.679 --> 00:19:25.143
You can smell that oil.

00:19:28.375 --> 00:19:29.208
Oh!

00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:32.410
Oh wow!

00:19:32.410 --> 00:19:34.560
The rice is fluffy and then

00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:38.250
it is coated in like meat juices and oils.

00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:40.710
And the rice is not sweet but

00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:43.910
then you've got this sweet
like dried raisins in there.

00:19:46.294 --> 00:19:47.893
And you got so many
different textures in there.

00:19:47.893 --> 00:19:48.726
You've got rice,

00:19:48.726 --> 00:19:49.770
which is almost like al dente.

00:19:49.770 --> 00:19:51.610
You've got the starchy chick peas.

00:19:51.610 --> 00:19:53.100
You've got the silky carrots.

00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:54.900
And I gotta try the sausage.

00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:55.910
Next up for the sausage,

00:19:55.910 --> 00:19:58.563
it's a special sausage it's horse sausage.

00:20:03.584 --> 00:20:04.417
It has kinda like a

00:20:04.417 --> 00:20:06.263
salted preserved taste to it a little bit.

00:20:07.341 --> 00:20:09.924
(upbeat music)

00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:14.007
I'll follow that with some of the salad.

00:20:14.007 --> 00:20:17.674
(speaking foreign language)

00:20:22.371 --> 00:20:23.454
It's amazing.

00:20:25.625 --> 00:20:26.708
Mmm, oh yeah.

00:20:28.851 --> 00:20:33.090
It's like those yogurt
balls that we had earlier.

00:20:33.090 --> 00:20:34.130
Just the fresh version.

00:20:34.130 --> 00:20:38.150
Well not really fresh but
the non hardened version.

00:20:38.150 --> 00:20:39.590
That provides like a totally different

00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:41.213
cooling sensation to your mouth.

00:20:42.105 --> 00:20:45.120
(upbeat music)

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:47.360
Yeah. It's spectacular.

00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:49.110
I'm washing it down with lemon tea.

00:20:52.771 --> 00:20:53.630
It's kinda sweet.

00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:55.290
And you can just taste that like

00:20:55.290 --> 00:20:57.164
undertone of lemoniness.

00:20:57.164 --> 00:20:59.747
(upbeat music)

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:06.229
That was one of those meals that's just

00:21:06.229 --> 00:21:08.610
filled me with an almost,

00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:11.720
it's almost a speechless,

00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:14.210
to the brim with a speechless overjoy.

00:21:14.210 --> 00:21:15.880
In like two to three hours

00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:20.880
they sell out of one and a
half tons of rice and meat.

00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:23.460
Empty, empty, empty, empty.

00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:24.293
There's the last one.

00:21:24.293 --> 00:21:26.053
There's just a little bit.

00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:33.700
But it is time for a
little stroll after the

00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:35.873
amount of food and quantity and

00:21:35.873 --> 00:21:38.300
meatiness and deliciousness of the food

00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:39.600
that we've eaten today.

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:43.090
But I was just even
reflecting on the morning,

00:21:43.090 --> 00:21:44.160
we went to the market which was

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:45.767
literally like a museum.

00:21:45.767 --> 00:21:48.806
And then that restaurant that
we just ate at for the plov.

00:21:48.806 --> 00:21:52.270
Like I don't think I can
describe it any better way

00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:55.668
than an opera house of meat and rice.

00:21:55.668 --> 00:21:57.500
This is one of the main square,

00:21:57.500 --> 00:22:00.790
one of the main gathering
areas of Tashkent but

00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:01.690
before we get there,

00:22:01.690 --> 00:22:04.500
we're just walking through
this beautiful lush park.

00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:06.020
Look at these trees.

00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:06.853
Big tress.

00:22:07.970 --> 00:22:09.880
Evergreens, flowers.

00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:11.460
It's so green and lush.

00:22:14.243 --> 00:22:16.652
Okay now we're in the artist's section.

00:22:16.652 --> 00:22:17.485
So I'm seeing some art.

00:22:17.485 --> 00:22:18.600
Some antiques.

00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:20.178
Lots of paintings.

00:22:20.178 --> 00:22:22.761
(upbeat music)

00:22:29.930 --> 00:22:31.640
Are you taking a video? (woman laughs)

00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:32.473
Okay run!

00:22:34.231 --> 00:22:37.718
Oh! (laughs)

00:22:37.718 --> 00:22:39.819
(boy laughing)

00:22:39.819 --> 00:22:43.986
(woman speaking foreign language)

00:22:49.370 --> 00:22:51.340
A jumping castle in Tashkent.

00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:53.180
I have definitely built up an appetite

00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:55.330
going up that hill and sliding down.

00:22:55.330 --> 00:22:56.850
I think we can,

00:22:56.850 --> 00:22:58.573
we're ready to eat again.

00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:04.820
- Hello.
- Pleasure, Mark.

00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:05.950
- Mark, hello.
- [Mark] Hello.

00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:07.444
- How are you?
- [Mark] Very good.

00:23:07.444 --> 00:23:09.183
- Welcome to Uzbekistan.
_ [Mark] Thank you very much.

00:23:09.183 --> 00:23:11.309
- I was talking you about.

00:23:11.309 --> 00:23:13.353
Everything in this is what remained.

00:23:14.275 --> 00:23:16.775
(men talking)

00:23:17.997 --> 00:23:21.280
- And next stop on this Tashkent
Uzbekistan food tour today,

00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:23.840
we've come to it's kind of
like a family restaurant.

00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:26.830
They have a bunch of local dishes.

00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:28.440
- This is what we came for.

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:29.280
- Another dish.

00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:32.550
Specific dish that we've
come here to eat is naryn,

00:23:32.550 --> 00:23:35.311
which is a dish that I've really been

00:23:35.311 --> 00:23:37.520
looking forward to trying
since I learned about it today.

00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:38.950
So has a very thin dough,

00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:41.800
which she slices into very fine juliennes.

00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:43.630
Then you move over to
this station where she's

00:23:43.630 --> 00:23:48.070
finely chopping up a mixture
of horse meat and beef.

00:23:48.070 --> 00:23:49.800
And that mixes into the dish.

00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:50.640
And then I think it gets

00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:52.623
assembled over at station number three.

00:24:01.930 --> 00:24:03.970
So she takes an equal amount of meat

00:24:03.970 --> 00:24:05.650
plus the julienne dough.

00:24:05.650 --> 00:24:07.210
Now she's just mixing it fully.

00:24:07.210 --> 00:24:08.440
She added in some seasoning.

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:09.300
Some local cumin,

00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:10.350
some black pepper.

00:24:10.350 --> 00:24:11.890
A little bit of oil and is just

00:24:11.890 --> 00:24:15.536
fully mixing it so that it's
completely even tossing it.

00:24:15.536 --> 00:24:19.180
(men speaking foreign language)

00:24:19.180 --> 00:24:21.870
- This is a soup in which

00:24:21.870 --> 00:24:24.373
the horse sausage was brewed.

00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:27.510
- You gotta eat this with your fingers.

00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:28.360
That's the traditional way.

00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:30.810
But just a mound of what she
mixed up with her fingers.

00:24:30.810 --> 00:24:32.590
The dough the julienned dough.

00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:33.500
The mixed in meat.

00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:36.250
The thick chunks of horse sausage.

00:24:36.250 --> 00:24:38.050
And then there's some onions on top.

00:24:38.050 --> 00:24:38.883
So I'll grab,

00:24:38.883 --> 00:24:40.470
you can see the pepper in there too.

00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:41.303
Oh nice.

00:24:41.303 --> 00:24:42.136
Oh that's beautiful.

00:24:42.136 --> 00:24:43.130
I can't wait to try it.

00:24:47.082 --> 00:24:48.670
Mmm!

00:24:48.670 --> 00:24:49.503
Wow!

00:24:50.586 --> 00:24:52.080
(laughing) Oh that's awesome.

00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:52.913
You've got like,

00:24:55.370 --> 00:24:56.300
they are kind of like noodles,

00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:59.300
but it almost has like
a cheese texture to it.

00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:01.039
And then you've got that meat mixed in.

00:25:01.039 --> 00:25:01.872
And it's oily.

00:25:01.872 --> 00:25:02.705
And you've got that light spice.

00:25:02.705 --> 00:25:03.538
The pepper in there.

00:25:03.538 --> 00:25:04.880
The light cumin.

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:08.190
And then again you can
really like taste the meat.

00:25:08.190 --> 00:25:10.460
So far today in the dishes,

00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:12.570
in the meat based dishes that we've had,

00:25:12.570 --> 00:25:14.990
the meat just comes in
so vibrantly flavorful,

00:25:14.990 --> 00:25:16.690
but so natural tasting.

00:25:16.690 --> 00:25:17.533
It's fat.

00:25:18.910 --> 00:25:20.795
- [Man] It's horse fat.

00:25:20.795 --> 00:25:24.020
(upbeat music)

00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:24.853
- Whoa!

00:25:26.553 --> 00:25:30.960
Wow it's like really meaty.

00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:33.650
And it is like a sausage.

00:25:33.650 --> 00:25:34.650
Like kind of like salty.

00:25:34.650 --> 00:25:36.030
Almost like salami.

00:25:36.030 --> 00:25:38.620
It's so succulent.

00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:41.320
This is the soup that the
horse sausage was boiled in.

00:25:44.763 --> 00:25:47.430
Mmm it has this saltiness.

00:25:47.430 --> 00:25:50.010
It's a little bit sourish.

00:25:50.010 --> 00:25:50.843
It's powerful.

00:25:50.843 --> 00:25:51.820
Yeah that's good.

00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:52.973
Really really good.

00:25:54.316 --> 00:25:56.130
Some of the boiled meat and rice,

00:25:56.130 --> 00:25:57.903
which has just turned into a paste.

00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:02.610
You can see the fibers in it.
- [Bekruz] Yeah, yeah.

00:26:02.610 --> 00:26:03.443
- Grains and rice and

00:26:03.443 --> 00:26:05.040
you can see the fibers in there but

00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:06.860
it's all just boiled and simmered down

00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:08.780
for like half a day,

00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:11.720
for like 11 or 12 hours until
it just turns into a paste.

00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:12.553
A porridge.

00:26:17.010 --> 00:26:17.843
It's like a,

00:26:19.810 --> 00:26:21.900
very like comforting.

00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:23.180
You've got a foamy,

00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:24.890
almost like a foamy texture to it.

00:26:24.890 --> 00:26:26.390
And again you taste that meat.

00:26:27.284 --> 00:26:28.570
Okay next up for the lamb sausage.

00:26:28.570 --> 00:26:30.240
And this is pretty hardcore.

00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:32.400
You can see the fat just laced within it.

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:33.890
It's a mix of organs as well,

00:26:33.890 --> 00:26:35.610
and then wrapped up into an intestine,

00:26:35.610 --> 00:26:39.303
and it's just dripping
in oily meaty juices.

00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:44.273
Wow!

00:26:47.210 --> 00:26:50.283
Yeah that's like fatty juicy.

00:26:52.490 --> 00:26:55.293
Yeah it's pretty good but that's meaty.

00:26:57.380 --> 00:26:58.503
Some of the lamb chop.

00:27:03.130 --> 00:27:05.960
Oh yeah it's delicious.

00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:06.883
It's so tender.

00:27:07.810 --> 00:27:09.410
That piece was kinda lean,

00:27:09.410 --> 00:27:11.830
or at least in comparison
to the last bite I had.

00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:13.080
And this one is the dolma.

00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:13.913
There's cabbage and

00:27:13.913 --> 00:27:15.220
there might be grape
leaves in here as well,

00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:17.070
but then rice and meat on the inside.

00:27:20.184 --> 00:27:21.867
And the dough in there.

00:27:21.867 --> 00:27:22.910
That's what makes it,

00:27:22.910 --> 00:27:25.170
that's what brings it to the next level.

00:27:25.170 --> 00:27:26.550
Moving through the meats,

00:27:26.550 --> 00:27:27.600
next up is the kebab.

00:27:28.699 --> 00:27:31.282
(upbeat music)

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:33.833
Oh wow!

00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:36.553
Yep that's a meat mummy.

00:27:36.553 --> 00:27:38.140
I taste the smokiness of it.

00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:39.070
How it's been,

00:27:39.070 --> 00:27:39.990
and the saltiness as well.

00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:42.340
How it's just been scorched
with the hot colds.

00:27:44.270 --> 00:27:47.850
It was all good but that horse noodle

00:27:47.850 --> 00:27:50.130
like dough dish with the soup,

00:27:50.130 --> 00:27:52.530
and that is unique,

00:27:52.530 --> 00:27:55.090
and it's incredibly good.

00:27:55.090 --> 00:27:56.370
Oh man it's good.

00:27:56.370 --> 00:27:57.430
We're gonna go back to the hotel.

00:27:57.430 --> 00:27:58.550
We're gonna rest for a couple hours and

00:27:58.550 --> 00:28:02.420
then we have one more meal
to complete this first,

00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:04.949
my very first day in Uzbekistan.

00:28:04.949 --> 00:28:09.949
Yeah it's been nothing short
of just impressive, impressive.

00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:12.370
And we met so many friendly people,

00:28:12.370 --> 00:28:13.203
so much good food,

00:28:13.203 --> 00:28:14.270
but we, okay all that to say,

00:28:14.270 --> 00:28:16.193
we have one more big dinner coming up.

00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:19.990
Wow this okay,

00:28:19.990 --> 00:28:21.700
we went back to the hotel,

00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:24.110
we rested for about an hour.

00:28:24.110 --> 00:28:26.230
It's very modern but very nice,

00:28:26.230 --> 00:28:31.230
very beautiful restaurant
with modern Uzbekistan style.

00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:32.700
And we're eating a dish,

00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:34.240
it's called (speaks foreign language).

00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:36.650
Look at this platter!

00:28:36.650 --> 00:28:38.020
It's a beauty!

00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:39.400
It's another stunner!

00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:41.580
And if you can notice right in the center,

00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:46.110
you'll see the horse sausage
that we've already eaten.

00:28:46.110 --> 00:28:48.640
Once or twice or three times today.

00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:50.018
You guys hungry?

00:28:50.018 --> 00:28:51.280
- Oh yeah! Look at it!

00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:52.770
I can't wait to try.

00:28:52.770 --> 00:28:56.560
- Sausage, that's like one of
the winning meats of the day.

00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:58.110
It's like sheets.

00:28:58.110 --> 00:29:00.723
Sheets of what look
like kind of like dough.

00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:05.313
Okay and I got some horse meat
on there as well of course.

00:29:08.952 --> 00:29:13.952
Mmm mmm.

00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:18.340
Oh that's incredible.

00:29:18.340 --> 00:29:20.670
Those are like noodle sheets.

00:29:20.670 --> 00:29:22.830
You've got that really meaty broth,

00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:25.400
that the noodles have
sort of soaked up with.

00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:27.224
That horse meat which is salty and

00:29:27.224 --> 00:29:29.020
like horse salami.

00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:31.070
And then the crispness
of the green onions.

00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:32.199
- What do you think,

00:29:32.199 --> 00:29:34.400
what is the main ingredient in this?

00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:35.900
What is the main ingredient?

00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:37.620
- The noodle or the dough.

00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:39.023
- No.
- [Mark] No?

00:29:40.030 --> 00:29:41.250
And it's not even the meat.

00:29:41.250 --> 00:29:43.093
It's the broth.
- The broth.

00:29:44.210 --> 00:29:46.910
Every now and then like in this bite,

00:29:46.910 --> 00:29:49.113
you get a cumin seed.

00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:51.650
Like a whole cumin seed but

00:29:51.650 --> 00:29:52.673
it's kind of mild.

00:29:56.844 --> 00:29:58.780
(Uzbek music)

00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:03.070
This has been one of those
days that just blows me away,

00:30:03.070 --> 00:30:05.580
and I'm still trying to process

00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:06.940
the food,

00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:08.520
the culture.

00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:10.586
We landed about,

00:30:10.586 --> 00:30:13.650
okay actually less than
24 hours in Tashkent.

00:30:13.650 --> 00:30:17.100
Slept for like two and
a half, three hours,

00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:18.730
then immediately got started

00:30:18.730 --> 00:30:21.280
on this ultimate Tashkent food tour.

00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:25.110
Truly a learning and just
a beautiful beautiful day.

00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:26.960
I loved the food.

00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:28.500
I loved the different dishes.

00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:31.870
Dishes I've never seen
or even imagined before.

00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:33.460
But even more than the food,

00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:34.293
the people,

00:30:34.293 --> 00:30:35.450
the hospitality,

00:30:35.450 --> 00:30:38.500
the friendliness and genuine kindness.

00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:40.070
So many people that we met today

00:30:40.070 --> 00:30:41.430
is what really shines.

00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:43.450
It's what really stands out.

00:30:43.450 --> 00:30:45.430
So I want to say a huge thank you to

00:30:45.430 --> 00:30:47.960
the Ministry of Tourism Uzbekistan who

00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:50.400
invited Ying and I to Uzbekistan.

00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:52.140
Thank you so much for making this happen.

00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:53.380
Thank you to Bekruz.

00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:55.280
Bekruz arranged everything.

00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:57.420
He did a lot of work to make this happen.

00:30:57.420 --> 00:30:58.380
So thank you so much.

00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:01.380
