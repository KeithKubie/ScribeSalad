Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic. I remember it so you don't have to.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.360
So why is this a thing now?

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.140
Don't get me wrong, I always enjoy 1995's A Goofy Movie fine.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:08.100
But somewhere in the past 5 or 10 years, it's gone from that cute little movie to Disney cult status,

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.680
garnering fanart, merchandise, reenactments, and too many cosplays to count.

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.720
I stayed away from reviewing this movie for a while because I didn't really understand what all the fuss was about.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.420
But my fascination over this fascination has finally gotten the best of me.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.880
What is it about this film that has left such an impact on so many people?

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.640
Well, I'm finally gonna take a closer look to find out.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.000
Let's time travel back to the 90's with A Goofy Movie.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.520
The opening credits start off standard enough, almost too standard.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.780
NC: I'm not gonna lie, a part of me really wonders what just A Movie would be.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.700
Boy meets girl, nothing happens for 2 hours, roll credits.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.200
I didn't say it'd be good, but it'd be A Movie.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:56.640
It starts off rather beautiful with our main character Max dreaming about a girl he has a crush on named Roxanne.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.220
Eh, to be fair, this fantasy is kinder than the fantasies the Internet has had about her.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.020
Oh, no, he's turning into Disney's real nightmare:

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.040
Oswald Rabbit!

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.700
Get over it, Disney! You got him back in Epic Mickey!

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.260
Goofy: HYUH-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HOH!

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.860
NC: Wow, I don't know how you make Goofy's laugh scary, but you found a way.

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.220
Goofy: HA-HA-HA-HOH!

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:39.000
NC: It's all just a dream, though, as Max answers his landline in-joke telling his friend PJ to get ready for the big day.

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.400
Goofy: Morning, son!

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:41.360
Max: Dad!

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.660
NC: His father Goofy, of course, embarrasses him every moment possible.

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.800
But Max says after today, he'll be the coolest kid on the block.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.080
High Schoolers: ♫ After today, my brains will be snoozing! ♫

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.780
Max: ♫ If I don't faint, I'll be fine! ♫

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.300
NC: As catchy as this song is, I have to ask...

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.740
Do all of the dogs just live in one neighborhood?

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.400
They're the only animals I see in this town.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:03.840
Is there a class system?

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.380
Are they the Lion King hyenas evolved years later?

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:07.580
Film Theory that shit!

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.460
It has to make more sense than how a bus full of kids turns into a bus full of cheerleaders and then back into a bus full of kids.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.800
Bus Driver: ♫ I'm gonna sit on my butt. ♫

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.400
NC: If you film it while complaining about movies, you could make a very good living that way.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.060
Sadly, we discover this movie's been infected by a Pauly Shore.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:28.400
Bobby: Cheddar! Awoo! Cheddar Whizzy!

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.780
NC: I was a thing!

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.500
He helps Max and PJ set up a prank during the school's last prep rally as-

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:36.900
Wait a minute, this is the 90's.

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.980
Cue the adult authority figure who just doesn't understand.

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:45.040
Principal Mazur: Principal Mazur, what can we do to not waste our summer vacation?

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.140
NC: Like never dealing with a Cecilian when death is on the line.

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.580
Principal Mazur: How about science slumber parties?

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:54.940
NC: OK, am I the only one who wants to see that happen?

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.220
What would Neil deGrasse Tyson's pajamas look like?

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:01.800
But they ambush the rally with Max dressed as their favorite pop star, Powerline.

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:02.960
Max: ♫ To stand out! ♫

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.620
Bobby: A little smokeage! Awooooooo!

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.600
NC: That should annoy me, but I'm just wondering what it means when a dog makes a dog sound.

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.080
Remember when Goofy owned a cat?

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:15.480
Is that like slavery?

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:18.820
Max also takes the opportunity to hit on Roxanne.

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.820
Max: ♫ There's nothing that I wouldn't do ♫

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.700
♫ If it was getting you to notice ♫

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.420
♫ I'm alive! ♫

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:29.540
NC: You know, is it possible to make something so dated, it's actually timeless?

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.720
This movie is really trying to say yes.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.340
He's finally caught, though, resulting in him getting detention.

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:36.840
Bobby: Max, look.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.480
It's the Leaning Tower of Cheese-a.

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:42.920
NC: He's not in this long.

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.660
Roxanne stumbles across Max, though, in the principal's office.

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:48.420
Roxanne: I liked your dance.

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:49.220
Max: Yeah.

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.820
Yeah?

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.100
Yeah, it's from Powerline's new video.

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.160
Roxanne: I know. He's totally a genius.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.760
Max: Yeah, he's doing a concert next week in LA.

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:58.260
Roxanne: Oh, yeah.

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.560
NC: Aw, it's puppy love.

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:00.360
Audience: BOOOOO!

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.800
NC: Don't act like you wouldn't have said it! Your hands are just as dirty!

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.900
It is nice that Roxanne isn't just a bland, popular knockout.

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:14.400
She's shy, nervous, has some geeky friends, and is just as awkward as Max, making for honestly some adorable flirting.

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:17.620
Max: Gosh, I'm sorry.

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:18.980
Roxanne: It's OK, really.

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:25.280
NC: I've never touched an ungloved hand before.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:32.480
He get a date with her, though, to watch the Powerline concert on TV as Goofy blissfully works his job as a baby photographer.

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:40.200
Interested in not sleeping tonight? Pause this movie when that kid's eyes go red.

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:44.460
You're welcome.

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:49.600
His coworker Pete tries to show off what a much better parent he is with his son.

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:55.640
Pete: Well, for all you know, he's running around with some gang and stealing stuff and causing riots!

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:59.080
Something's wrong when a kid won't spend time with his parents.

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.000
NC: Just ask Norman Bates.

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:04.280
But Goofy gets a call about the trouble Max is in.

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:05.920
Principal Mazur: Dressed like a gang member...

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:06.720
Goofy: Gang member?

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:12.220
Principal Mazur: Your son caused the entire student body to break into a riotous frenzy!

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:17.340
NC: Why, this wordage is eerily similar to my coworker's verbalization of my fears.

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:21.180
Principal Mazur: I'd seriously reevaluate the way you're raising your child

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:24.320
before he ends up in the electric chair!

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:28.140
NC: Because Goofy cartoons should always suggest that imagery.

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:34.900
Goofy thinks he's been too hard on Max, though, so he decides to take him on a fishing trip, ruining his date with Roxanne.

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:37.880
Goofy: It's a vacation with me and my best buddy.

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:39.220
Max: Oh, Donald Duck?

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.960
NC: Naw, he's gone all angular and weird.

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:43.560
I'm kinda afraid of him now.

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:45.560
Max: We're going fishing?!

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:48.000
Goofy: Yup, just like my dad and me did.

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:50.820
We're using the same map me and my dad used.

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:53.480
NC: Huh, I don't see Dippy Dawg's name on that map.

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:54.920
Google it. You'll get a giggle.

00:06:55.880 --> 00:07:00.020
Max convinces Goofy to drop by Roxanne's house, though, to tell her the bad news.

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:03.840
Max: Is Roxanne home?

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.380
Roxanne: It's OK, Daddy. Max is a friend from school.

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:09.780
NC: Please call off your dad dog.

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:17.680
Afraid she might find someone else, he makes up a lie saying he's gonna be onstage at the Powerline concert because his dad knows him personally.

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.240
Of course, he has no idea how to make this possible.

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:22.960
Goofy: You think of a name and I'll try and guess who it is.

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:23.920
Man or woman?

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:25.160
Max: Man.

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:27.360
Goofy: Walt Disney.

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:28.280
Max: Right.

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:30.060
NC: Ahyuck!

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:32.280
Did we just implode our universe for a minute?

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:33.440
Oh, well.

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:37.980
To try and make Max feel better, Goofy tries singing a little song.

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:42.420
Goofy: ♫ Do you need a break from modern living? ♫

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:45.900
♫ Do you long to shed your weary load? ♫

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:48.380
Mickey: ♫ And it's Califor-ni-a or- ♫

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:52.260
NC: Wait, Mickey Mouse is on a phone, yet he still has to hitchhike?

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:55.940
And he's with Donald who Goofy said he's really good friends with?

00:07:56.080 --> 00:08:00.700
Dude, Max, you should ask, maybe your dad does know Powerline. These are some weird connections.

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:03.400

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:10.220
NC: OK, has anyone put together how potentially disturbing this song sequence is?

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:17.000
You have country singers stuffed in a piano, a hostage in the trunk of a car, and the dead literally coming back to life!

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:19.340
This is a friggin' morbid interstate!

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:25.120
So they drop by a possum children's attraction along the way because apparently, that exists in this world too.

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:27.560
Little Kid: No, Mommy, I don't wanna go!

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:31.380

NC: Yet another creepy child in this movie.

00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:42.040
Can we just keep the camera off them for the remainder of the film?

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:49.220
Goofy: I'll be right back, my little possum pal!

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:51.420
Max: My life's a living-

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:53.400
Lester: Hello, little buddy!

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:57.460
NC: OK, G film, you were this close to getting a P put in front of you.

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:02.340
Also, why is anyone dressed like a giant animal? They're all giant animals.

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:03.560
There is no novelty.

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:05.480
Max: Dad, stop, please!

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:09.200
Dad, look, this is embarrassing!

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:14.580
NC: OK, Goofy Movie surprisingly has a lot of nightmare fuel.

00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:23.700
Feeling embarrassed, Goofy tries to make Max feel better by showing him how to fish.

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:29.280
Goofy: Lemme show you a little family secret handed down through about 12 or 13 Goof generations.

The Perfect Cast.

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:32.220
Max: What?

00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:33.780
Goofy: The Perfect Cast.

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:36.760
NC: You know, something Suicide Squad didn't have.

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:39.620
But they come across Bigfoot.

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:41.280
Yeah, that happens.

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:45.320
Max: C'mon, hurry up!

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:49.940
NC: Not gonna lie, this is kinda a weird direction.

00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:53.420
I surprisingly expected a little less goofiness out of A Goofy Movie.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:57.220
They get trapped in the car as Bigfoot looks through their belongings.

00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:02.700
[Stayin' Alive by the Bee Gees]

00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:07.320
I know I should be laughing, but now I'm just wondering what the Bee Gees as dog people look like.

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:15.220
Max and Goofy start to bond over making food, though, as Goofy reminds Max of when he used to spell "Hi Dad" in his alphabet soup.

00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:18.300
Goofy: You used to spell things out using the letters like...uh...

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:19.320
Max: "Ambidextrous"?

00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:20.280
Goofy: Little words like...

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:21.260
Max: "Hasta la vista"?

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:22.240
Goofy: Like "Bye bye"...

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:23.840
Max: Or "I pledge allegiance"-

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:25.800
Goofy: Or "I love you".

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:32.640

NC: Excuse me, I've got something in my eye.

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:46.360
There we go. Where was I?

00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:47.200
Oh, yeah, this scene.

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:49.520
THIS SCENE MAKES ME CRY!

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.360
Doug: You looking at my butt? Good.

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:06.980
How can you not in these Mott &amp; Bow jeans?

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:11.840
They look great, are super comfortable, and feel 10 times better than any other jeans I've tried.

00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:17.660
With plenty of styles for both men and women, it's so easy to get the perfect pair, especially with their home try-on program.

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:19.680
You can even send back the pair you don't want.

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:27.960
In fact, if you go to their site, you can not only see the other clothes that they have, but also see all the great reviews they got, their history, and even the science of denim.

00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:31.780
They go into the science of why your hams will look amazing.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.160
God bless you, science of denim!

00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:36.700
Look at that butt, it's the butt of the gods!

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:39.680

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:46.760
You can have my butt in jean form!

00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:50.180
Go, have my butt in jean form at MottAndBow.com.

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:57.220
Great jeans creating great prices creating great butts.

00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:58.880
What's not to adore?

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:15.960
NC: Max starts to write to Roxanne, admitting he lied, but then realizes he can change the map to go to the concert.

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:27.100
Because every kid needs their first "Oh, I get it."

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:32.400
Unaware the map's been altered, they both compromise and visit the places the other wants to see.

00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:39.580
Ahyuh! I committed abstract murder.

00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:45.300
They end up at what I can only describe as the Little Mermaid's love shack.

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:48.040
Ew, those fish gotta stare at Goofy's junk all night!

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:50.840
Are there fish people in this world? I need to know how to judge this!

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:54.960
As Pete and PJ happen to be staying at the exact same place.

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:58.300
Pete overhears about Max changing the map and decides to tell Goof.

00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:01.440
Pete: I just hate to be the bearer of bad news, but...

00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:04.940
Well, I heard the little mutant telling PJ that he changed the map, so...

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:07.340
You're headed straight to LA, pal.

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:11.460
NC: On a side note, do we really not even take off our gloves in the hot tub?

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:13.520
Our world is weird, Goof.

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:17.400
Funny enough, this moment gets surprisingly uncomfortable.

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:23.800
Goofy: You know, maybe Max isn't all the things that you think a son should be, but he loves me.

00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:26.560
Pete: Hey, my son respects me.

00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:28.200
Goofy: Yeah.

00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:34.080
I'm starting to think Pete's hiding an abusive family story we're not aware of.

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:37.460
Where did the wife and daughter go?

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:41.360
Goofy does check the map, though, and realizes Pete was right,

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:46.480
leading to a great scene where Goofy gives Max a chance to redeem himself by telling him the right direction.

00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:47.520
Goofy: Left or right?

00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:48.480
Max: Uh...

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:49.520
Goofy: C'mon, Max!

00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:51.360
Max: LEFT!

00:13:56.860 --> 00:13:59.960
NC: Most Disney movies would have this be the time where Max does the right thing.

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:03.600
But they make it a bit more interesting by still having him lie.

00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:09.240
After Goofy gets fed up in one of the few quiet moments of the film, they finally open up and share their feelings.

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:12.400
In the most cartoony way possible.

00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:15.760
Goofy: Well, you ruined the vacation!

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:18.020
Max: I never

00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:19.260
wanted to go-

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:24.900
NC: On the one hand, I'm kinda wishing they talked about their feelings at the top, utilizing that quiet moment some more.

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:33.020
But on the other hand, talking about your feelings while tumbling down a canyon and driving through rapids feels like the way A Goofy Movie should handle this.

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:34.640
Max: I've got my own life now!

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:35.820
Goofy: I know that!

00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:38.220
I just wanted to be part of it!

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:40.820
NC: They blow up at each other and sit in silence while-

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:42.560
Well, there's no other way to say it.

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:43.540
They're in a car...

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:45.360
Matt Foley: Down by the river!

00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:48.820
NC: They do open up slowly, though, via song.

00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:53.080
Goofy and Max: ♫ Nobody else but you. ♫

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:55.440
♫ It's just our luck. ♫

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:58.680
♫ We're stuck together. ♫

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:03.340
NC: Really, we should be singing about how our car would've drowned by now and we should both be dead, but this is cool, too.

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:05.060
Speaking of death...

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:06.520
Goofy: WATERFALL?!

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:09.800
NC: Max remembers the Perfect Cast, though, and uses it to save his dad.

00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:12.860
As a way to say thanks for getting them in that situation in the first place,

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:17.560
Goofy helps Max partake in breaking, entering, and forgetting he has a serious girlfriend for a minute.

00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:20.300
Goofy even has a little bit of a creeper moment, too.

00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:24.820
I don't wanna know the other times Goofy has made that face.

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:33.100
Through a series of mess-ups, both Max and Goofy make their way in front of the crowd with Powerline,

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:37.440
who, of course, just rolls with the dangerous strangers who rush the stage.

00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:40.560
And Brittney Spears asked if her intruder had a gun.

00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:41.960
She should've just danced with him!

00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:45.660
Powerline: ♫ If we listen to each other's heart ♫

00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:49.360
NC: So everyone watching, of course, sees Max and Goofy on TV.

00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:54.760
Bobby: Yeah, Max is on the tube! That's Max! I know him!

00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:57.780
NC: He's dancing with Prince Devo Jackson!

00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:00.660
Max returns home and tells Roxanne the truth.

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:04.800
But she, of course, understands and it leads to more adorkable chemistry.

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:06.440
Roxanne: You wanna do something tonight?

00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:08.560
Max: I'm kinda doing something with my dad.

00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:09.580
Honest!

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:10.980
How about tomorrow?

00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:12.060
Roxanne: Deal.

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:18.340
Max: Hyuh-huh-huh-huh-huh-huh-huh!

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:25.480
NC: I wanna bundle you both up in a cute ball and put you in a cute box of cute.

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:31.920
Goofy, of course, embarrasses him again, but this time, Max decides to roll with and just accept who he is.

00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:34.840
Max: Roxanne, I'd like you to meet my dad.

00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:36.880
Goofy: Enchante, mademoiselle.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
NC: Ahyuh! I killed a mime.

00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:46.620
And that was A Goofy Movie. Is it as good as people have built it up over the years?

00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:51.100
Honestly, I will admit the more I watch it, the better it gets.

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:53.280
It's silly, of course. That's to be expected.

00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:59.620
But it also captures a lot of the excitement, insecurities, and angers of being a teen as well as being a parent.

00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:04.200
Their disconnect is very believable and neither side is necessarily wrong.

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:09.920
It's an identifiable connection that allows for a fair amount of laughs as well as a fair amount of drama.

00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:15.640
Even the serious moments from Goofy, from friggin' Goofy, are surprisingly kinda touching.

00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:21.100
Sure, it's a product of its times, but it seems dated in the right ways and it seems timeless in the right ways,

00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:24.500
making it enjoyably retro but also sympathetically heartfelt.

00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:29.920
Add in a touch of a cynical edge, beautifully flowing animation, and artistically pleasing backdrops,

00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:33.860
and you have a movie that tried a lot harder than it needed to,

00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:38.040
resulting in an experience that's surprisingly still pretty damn good.

00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:44.060
I'm the Nostalgia Critic. I remember it so you don't have to.
