00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:03.410
So now let's think about, I
talked about what the Fed's

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:04.790
bailout proposal is.

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:08.470
They essentially want to take
$700 billion and use that to

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:13.860
buy some of these smelly assets,
these CDOs that a lot

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.670
of these banks have on
the balance sheet.

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:18.540
Which have been kind of the
cause of why a lot of these

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.270
banks are going under.

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:21.920
Or at least why a lot
of the banks aren't

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:22.660
lending to each other.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.180
And I kind of touched on it in
the last video that, in my

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.240
mind, maybe its solves the
problem, but even if it does

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.670
solve a problem, we'll address
that in this video, but it

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:35.810
seems like a really horrible
thing to do.

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:39.420
Because if you were to buy
these assets, let's say

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.980
they're worth zero, you pay
$2 billion for them.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.260
You're essentially writing a
check to the equity holders of

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.130
this company, the shareholders
of this company, they

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.600
benefited from all the reward
of the last five years of

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.890
getting the returns on that
stock price and the dividends

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:54.960
and whatever else.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.680
And now all of a sudden when
things go bad, they

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:57.580
don't bear the risk.

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:59.670
The American taxpayer
bears the risk.

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.700
And so you're writing a $1
billion check to the equity

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.360
holders and a $1 billion check
to the liability holders, or

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.410
the people who lent this
company money.

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:09.590
And you've probably heard
the word moral

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.310
hazard bantered around.

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.090
And this is as good of a time as
any to explain what people

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.970
mean by moral hazard.

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.570
Well there's a couple, there's
one, just a superficial notion

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.120
of, hey you are writing a check
to the very same people

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.500
who made bad decisions.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.700
The people who lent this
company money made bad

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.510
decisions and the equity holders
of this company made

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:35.120
bad decisions.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.900
One, the people who invested in
this company, they didn't

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:38.900
realize the risk.

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.240
And also, a lot of the equity
holders are the management of

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.910
the company.

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:44.890
And they're the very ones who
invested in these CDOs.

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.830
And if you were to essentially
buy out these CDOs, you're not

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.030
penalizing them for making
bad decisions.

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.140
They get to keep all their
bonuses before.

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.070
Maybe they get to keep
their jobs still.

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.170
And you're propping up
their stock price.

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.180
So that's one element
of moral hazard.

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.120
The other element of moral
hazard, and this is a more

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.440
nuanced notion, but it's in some
ways the more important

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.860
element of moral hazard.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.190
And that's if the government
goes in every time that

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.310
there's some type of
financial stress.

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.510
All these people took risk, they
got their reward already.

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.560
But when the risk starts to hit,
the government goes in

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.900
and make sure that these people
don't have to deal with

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.140
their consequences.

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.370
The moral hazard there is in the
future, people are going

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.230
to say I'm going to take risk.

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.320
Because if when times
are good, I'm

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.370
going to make the money.

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.500
And when times are bad, we've
seen it multiple times, the

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.790
government, the U.S. government,
is all too ready

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.760
to come out and bail out
the private sector.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.650
So you create this moral hazard
of making these bubbles

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.400
more likely to happen
in the future.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.980
Because people are not going to
be as concerned about risk,

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.860
because they're, like, look at
these idiots, they took all

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.060
the risks in the world, they
bought CDOs, there were people

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.990
who lent money to these people
who bought CDOs, they were

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.830
levered up.

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.470
And the government even bailed
out these dudes.

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.920
So I can take huge risk, I'll
get all the reward from it,

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.180
and in the future the government
is just going to

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.180
bail me out.

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.260
And that's the other element
of moral hazard.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.070
Well anyway, I would argue that
there's a lot of moral

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:14.290
hazard with the government's
current bailout proposal.

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.460
Maybe that moral hazard is worth
it if it prevents this

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:21.740
chain, this cascade, of
events from happening.

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:24.730
If somehow it allows people to
start lending to each other

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.970
and most importantly, start
lending to the real world,

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.950
like the guy who wants to build
a factory or the farmer

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.860
who wants to borrow money for
seeds for next year's crop.

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.760
What I've heard, and I don't
know the exact numbers here,

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:43.750
and I'm not an expert here, is
that there's about $5 trillion

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.980
of these toxic CDOs.

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.600
On all of these financial
institutions' balance sheet.

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.070
So I don't know if that's
the accurate number.

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:55.760
But I do know for sure, $700
billion is a relatively small

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.460
fraction of the total amount
that's out there.

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:00.810
And Bernanke and Paulson,
they're essentially arguing,

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.440
no we know $700 billion doesn't
represent all the CDOs

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.920
out there, even if you were
to buy them at a discount.

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.680
But what we're hoping to do is
by going out there and with a

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.660
large amount of money and
starting to buy these CDOs,

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.240
that'll hopefully create
some type of a

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:18.480
market in these CDOs.

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.760
And they talk about doing
a reverse auction.

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.340
Where we'll say, OK
we're ready to buy

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:23.670
$100 billion in CDOs.

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:29.050
So whatever banks are willing to
give us $100 billion worth

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.050
of CDOs at the best price, those
are the ones we're going

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.500
to buy from.

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:32.720
That's a reverse auction.

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.250
You go and you say, I want to
buy, who's going to sell to me

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:36.800
for the cheapest price?

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.210
And by doing that, maybe
it'll create

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.490
other private interests.

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.610
We'll say hey, the government's
getting a good

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.160
deal on these CDOs, I want to
buy in too and maybe other

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.940
people will start buying
these CDOs.

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.330
The reason why I call that
crap is because if other

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.150
people were there to buy CDOs,
they would buy them already.

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.050
And the bottom line is, when
you do this type of reverse

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.090
auction, when you say, oh I have
$100 billion I want to

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:02.430
spend on CDOs, Paulson and
Bernanke are arguing that that

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.260
would somehow create some type
of market price for these CDOs

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.970
that these banks can then mark
their assets and everyone will

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:11.380
know what they're worth.

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:13.740
Two problems. That will
not be a market price.

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.770
Because you're creating
artificial demand.

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:17.440
Artificial demand from
the government.

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.110
If the government wasn't there,
there wouldn't be this

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:22.120
$100 billion entity wanting
to buy assets.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.990
So the assets would
go for less.

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:27.260
And then the second thing is,
what if the government does

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.630
that and people realize that
these $2 billion of CDOs, even

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.520
when the government does this
reverse auction, are actually

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.990
worth only $500 million.

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:39.440
That's what people are willing
to unload them for.

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.150
And it would probably the
more solvent people

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:41.490
who would do it.

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:43.760
Because for them it won't
make them go bankrupt.

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.880
Well if they're really worth
$500 million, then every other

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:51.590
bank that holds the same thing
will have to write this $2

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:52.840
billion down to $500 million.

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.020
And so their equity will get
wiped out and the cascade will

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:56.320
start over again.

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:57.910
So I don't buy it
on two counts.

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:00.400
One, I don't think it'll
actually create a real market

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:01.780
price that anyone
would believe.

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:04.350
I don't think it's going to
make anyone jump into the

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:05.440
market all of a sudden.

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.325
Frankly, if someone thought
these were good deals, there

00:06:07.325 --> 00:06:10.100
are a lot of very very
sophisticated investors out

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.510
there who have a lot more
knowledge about what these

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:16.690
assets really mean than frankly
the Treasury does.

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:19.260
And if they thought they were
good deals, I guarantee you

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.450
there's capital out there where
they would go and buy

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:24.310
these assets for what they
thought is a good deal.

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:25.840
And hold them to maturity.

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:27.220
There is cash out there.

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.590
And I think that's an important
issue that people

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:30.170
don't realize.

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:32.380
A lot of people are out there
holding cash, they're holding

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:33.320
treasuries.

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:34.720
They just don't want to invest
in these because

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:35.710
they are bad deals.

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:36.870
People are looking
for a good deal.

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:39.470
But these are most probably
not worth much.

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:41.700
They're probably
worth nothing.

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:44.590
So what is another solution?

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:47.040
And this is something that a
lot of people have bantered

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:47.620
around a lot.

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:50.500
They said, well why doesn't the
government just go in and

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:52.540
instead of just buying out
these CDOs, which is

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:55.690
essentially just writing a check
to the very people who

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:58.100
got us into the situation,
why not buy

00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:59.270
stock in these companies?

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:03.020
So we talked about those
situations with the sovereign

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:03.860
wealth funds.

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:07.170
Where the sovereign wealth fund
comes in, in that example

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:11.150
they bought $3 billion worth
of equity, and they gave $3

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:12.290
billion worth of cash.

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:15.190
And then the company can use
those to pay off its debt.

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:19.310
That frankly, is not
a horrible idea.

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:21.240
The only reason why I would
say it's still not a great

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:23.990
idea is, you're diluting
the shareholders.

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:26.390
But what if this equity
is worth zero?

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:27.990
What if there's actually
negative equity here?

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:31.480
If this is worth zero, if these
$2 billion are actually

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:34.520
worth zero, then this is
an insolvent company.

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:37.810
You have $3 billion of assets,
$4 billion of liabilities,

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:41.080
this is actually minus
$1 billion of equity.

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:43.110
So really the stock
has no value.

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:46.570
The correct share price of the
stock, if we didn't have

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:49.390
limited liability with
corporations, the correct

00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:52.180
market capitalization would
be minus $1 billion.

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:53.630
So why would you pay a positive

00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:55.340
price for those shares?

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:58.890
So even in that situation, if
this is really worth zero, and

00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:02.640
the government were to buy a lot
of shares and infuse this

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:05.240
with capital, it would
save the company.

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:07.290
It would penalize the
equity holders.

00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:09.310
Because all of a sudden instead
of having 500 million

00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:11.360
shares, you maybe have
2 billion shares.

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:14.420
If you owned 100% of the company
before, now you only

00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:16.250
own 20% of the company.

00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:17.955
And that's actually what
happened with AIG.

00:08:17.955 --> 00:08:19.780
You might say well that's a
pretty good situation, but

00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:21.950
still the government's taking
a little bit of a hit.

00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:25.110
And and frankly, if the
government did that, I think

00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:27.770
the risk-reward might
be reasonable there.

00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:30.880
Because if the government were
to infuse capital into these

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:33.640
banks-- let me do the example.

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:36.090
Let's say there's 500
million shares now.

00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:38.200
The government says,
we're going to give

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:40.630
this company $4 billion.

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:42.460
So we're going to give it
$4 billion in cash.

00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:55.400
And let's say for those four
billion shares, we want--

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:57.010
let's make it really intense.

00:08:57.010 --> 00:09:01.780
Let's say the government wants
ten billion shares.

00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:04.370
So essentially they're paying
$0.40 per share.

00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:07.240
So then we're going to have
10 billion shares here.

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:08.960
So that's 10,000 million.

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:12.690
And we're going to have
10.5 billion shares.

00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:15.000
This is actually not a
bad situation for me.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.580
So the company now will have $4
billion of cash, $3 billion

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:21.710
of other assets.

00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:25.430
And now these CDOs maybe
are worth nothing.

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:28.260
Now no matter what, this company
cannot go bankrupt.

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.590
It has $4 billion of cash, $4
billion of liability, it could

00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:33.620
pay off its liability with
that equity infusion.

00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:38.700
And the people who deserved to
kind of take some downside,

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:39.590
did get downside.

00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:41.820
Because the equity holders, they
used to have 100% of the

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:43.990
company with their 500
million shares.

00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:46.750
Now they own, what is this?

00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:48.850
They own 1/21 of
their company.

00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:52.380
So they got diluted from owning
100% of the company to

00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:55.380
owning less than 5%
of the company.

00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:57.710
So this might be a
fair situation.

00:09:57.710 --> 00:10:00.840
Although, I would still say even
in this situation you are

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:05.000
bailing out the people who lent
this money to the bank.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.800
They lent money to an
institution that they

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:10.440
should've known better than
to lend money to.

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:12.940
They're holding all these toxic
assets, they collected

00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:14.240
interest on this institution.

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:16.680
Right when this institution was
about to go belly up, the

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:19.030
government does this huge
equity infusion and

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:21.260
essentially takes over
the company.

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:22.940
Makes it a part of
the government.

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:25.100
Because the government now owns
90-something percent of

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:26.280
the company.

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:28.160
And pays off the liability
holders.

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:30.890
So I would still say that
there's still some moral

00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:31.440
hazard here.

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:36.890
Because in the future, you're
still hurting the equity

00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:39.730
holders, but you'd still be
willing to lend to an American

00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:42.670
bank, because you'd say, when
things get bad the American

00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:45.810
government goes in and
bails out the bank by

00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:46.930
buying a bunch of equity.

00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:51.420
So you won't properly price
and risk in the future.

00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:55.160
But if this does open up lending
markets and people

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:58.950
start lending to the farmer or
to the guy who wants to build

00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:01.650
factories, then maybe
this is worth it.

00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:06.350
And actually, in my mind, if the
government is really not

00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:08.410
worried about the banks, and
they really are worried about

00:11:08.410 --> 00:11:11.650
this piece, the farmer who needs
a loan, or the guy wants

00:11:11.650 --> 00:11:13.450
to build a factory that
needs a loan.

00:11:13.450 --> 00:11:16.550
Why don't they take that $700
billion and just create a fund

00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:19.760
to lend directly to the real
world, to lend directly to

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:20.530
Main Street?

00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:23.180
Why don't they just let all of
these banks go bankrupt, go

00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:24.310
into bankruptcy?

00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:26.910
They'll come back and they'll
come back leaner and more

00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:30.410
efficient with proper risk
measures and everyone will get

00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:31.370
punished appropriately.

00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:34.600
So that in the next up cycle
there won't be all of this

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:35.710
moral hazard.

00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:40.360
And you have the $700 billion
that is going directly to lend

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:45.890
to farmers and companies that
are building capital equipment

00:11:45.890 --> 00:11:46.390
and whatever.

00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:48.130
And of course, there still
is moral hazard.

00:11:48.130 --> 00:11:49.440
And it's going to get
highly politicized.

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:50.960
Who do you lend to, et cetera?

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:53.040
Maybe then you still do
a reverse auction.

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:55.820
But the bottom line is, if the
government were genuine about

00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:58.980
being concerned about Main
Street, they wouldn't use this

00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:00.870
$700 billion in this
indirect way.

00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:03.520
They would lend it directly
to Main Street.

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:06.430
Anyway, see you in
the next video.
