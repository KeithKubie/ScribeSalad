I'm speaking more about graduate courses
but not completely I have found myself

00:34:35.829 --> 00:34:35.839
but not completely I have found myself
 

00:34:35.839 --> 00:34:39.000
but not completely I have found myself
more and more learning from my students

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:39.010
more and more learning from my students

one of the big big big questions was are
 

00:35:08.569 --> 00:35:11.470
one of the big big big questions was are
we going to be Russian Institute's or

00:35:11.470 --> 00:35:11.480
we going to be Russian Institute's or
 

00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:14.109

and one of our russian majors actually

00:36:27.849 --> 00:36:27.859
and one of our russian majors actually
 

00:36:27.859 --> 00:36:29.320
and one of our russian majors actually
really did all the work for a

this is really now this is of course an

this is really now this is of course an

actually can't offer these degrees but

00:36:39.099 --> 00:36:39.109
actually can't offer these degrees but
 

00:36:39.109 --> 00:36:40.630
actually can't offer these degrees but
the courses are obviously being taught

00:36:40.630 --> 00:36:40.640
the courses are obviously being taught
 

00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:42.490
the courses are obviously being taught
by Columbia graduate students and

by Columbia graduate students and
faculty you know so again that's a

00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:45.890
faculty you know so again that's a
 

00:36:45.890 --> 00:36:47.710

00:36:47.710 --> 00:36:47.720
peculiarity of our institutional
 

00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:49.870
peculiarity of our institutional
structure but it also shows that even at

00:36:49.870 --> 00:36:49.880
structure but it also shows that even at
 

00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:51.490

the undergraduate level we're getting

00:36:51.490 --> 00:36:51.500
the undergraduate level we're getting
 

00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:54.040
the undergraduate level we're getting
more students from the region who have

00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:54.050
more students from the region who have
 

00:36:54.050 --> 00:36:55.690
more students from the region who have
some knowledge they're usually

some knowledge they're usually

first-generation here some of them are
warm they are some point here and they

warm they are some point here and they
 

00:37:01.550 --> 00:37:04.210
warm they are some point here and they
want to study and they need to study

00:37:04.210 --> 00:37:04.220
want to study and they need to study
 

00:37:04.220 --> 00:37:06.609
want to study and they need to study
because as I think it's been said

00:37:06.609 --> 00:37:06.619
because as I think it's been said
 

00:37:06.619 --> 00:37:08.920
because as I think it's been said
sometimes it's it's it sometimes if not

00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:08.930
sometimes it's it's it sometimes if not
 

00:37:08.930 --> 00:37:12.760
sometimes it's it's it sometimes if not
always it's harder to teach those who

00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:12.770
always it's harder to teach those who
 

00:37:12.770 --> 00:37:14.560
always it's harder to teach those who
knew something then those who know

00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:14.570
knew something then those who know
 

00:37:14.570 --> 00:37:19.960
knew something then those who know
nothing and so some of the émigré some

00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:19.970
nothing and so some of the émigré some
 

00:37:19.970 --> 00:37:23.700
nothing and so some of the émigré some
of the émigré students who come from

00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:23.710
of the émigré students who come from
 

00:37:23.710 --> 00:37:26.380
of the émigré students who come from
families where they've learned something

00:37:26.380 --> 00:37:26.390
families where they've learned something
 

00:37:26.390 --> 00:37:29.050
families where they've learned something
have to unlearn some things that

00:37:29.050 --> 00:37:29.060
have to unlearn some things that
 

00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:31.750
have to unlearn some things that
American students are just no nothing so

00:37:31.750 --> 00:37:31.760
American students are just no nothing so
 

00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:33.900
American students are just no nothing so
we can just pour stuff right into them

00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:33.910
we can just pour stuff right into them
 

00:37:33.910 --> 00:37:38.380
we can just pour stuff right into them
so that is an issue as well now I want

00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:38.390
so that is an issue as well now I want
 

00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:39.910
so that is an issue as well now I want
to talk a little bit about this course

00:37:39.910 --> 00:37:39.920
to talk a little bit about this course
 

00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:41.290
to talk a little bit about this course
is precisely the point of view the
