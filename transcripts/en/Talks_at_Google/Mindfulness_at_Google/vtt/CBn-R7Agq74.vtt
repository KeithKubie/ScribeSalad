RACHAEL O'MEARA: Hi,
everybody, and welcome.

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:06.280
We're going to go
ahead and get started.

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:07.770
My name is Rachael
O'Meara and I'm

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.060
really excited to host today
our speaker, Neil Pasricha.

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.410
A few things about Neil
before we jump in--

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:17.730
So Neil Pasricha is
"The New York Times"

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.910
bestselling author of
"The Book of Awesome"

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.050
series, which has been
published in 10 countries

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.470
and spent over five
years on bestseller lists

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.570
and sold over a million copies.

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.540
"The Book of Awesome" was
based on his blog, 1000

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.440
Awesome Things, which has
scored over 50 million hits

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.440
and twice won the Webby award
for best blog in the world.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:37.940
That's pretty good.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.060
Pasricha is a Harvard MBA,
one of the most popular TED

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.710
speakers of all time,
and today serves

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.720
as director of the Institute
for Global Happiness.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.040
Previously, he spent a decade
running leadership development

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.810
inside Wal-mart, the
world's largest company.

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:57.180
Neil has created global
leadership programs

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.340
for many Fortune 50
companies, and has

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.680
spoken to hundreds of thousands
of people around the globe.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.280
His work has been
featured by CNN, BBC, TED,

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.180
"The Today Show," and
the "Sunday Times."

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.970
I'm very excited to
present and introduce Neil.

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.720
Today he shares his new book,
"The Happiness Equation."

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.090
Thank you and welcome.

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.777
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:18.777 --> 00:01:20.610
NEIL PASRICHA: Thank
you very much, Rachael.

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:21.520
I appreciate that.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:22.300
Thanks, everybody.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.600
How's everybody doing today?

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.620
Feeling good?

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.650
What a joy this to
be a Google today.

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.750
This is just a nice
delight for me.

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.640
You guys work here, so it's
not maybe special every day.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.290
But for me, coming
down the highway,

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:37.740
pulling into this
place that I've

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.030
heard so much about
for so many years,

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.736
it just feels like a bit
of a dream come true.

00:01:42.736 --> 00:01:44.610
I'm so flattered that
you invited me to come,

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.120
so thank you so
much for having me.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.850
You know, my whole story
kind of begins with Google,

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.034
to be honest with you.

00:01:51.034 --> 00:01:52.450
A number of years
ago, I was going

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.320
through a really big
rough patch in my life.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.460
I was in a marriage heading
in the wrong direction.

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:58.960
And I had a really
close friend that

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.800
was battling mental illness.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.540
And in that time, I
didn't know where to turn.

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:09.169
So I turned to Google, and I
typed in "how to start a blog"

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:11.550
and I pressed I'm Feeling Lucky.

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.250
It was, like, one of the few
times I was feeling lucky.

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.860
And 10 minutes later,
I had started up

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.430
a tiny website called
1000AwesomeThings.com just

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.820
as a way to put a smile
on my face every day

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.000
before I went to bed.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
So I start coming
home from work.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.770
And I start writing
about flipping

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.670
to the cold side of the pillow
in the middle of the night.

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.144
And I pressed Post.

00:02:33.144 --> 00:02:34.810
And then I started
writing about hitting

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.240
a string of green lights
when you're late for work.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.210
And I'd write a little bit about
that, and then I'd press Post.

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:42.876
And then I started writing about
getting called up to the dinner

00:02:42.876 --> 00:02:45.390
buffet first at a wedding, you
know, table 76 in the back!

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.060
You get the meatballs before
they're stuck together

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.800
and everything.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:48.890
And then I'd press Post.

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:54.490
And while I started writing
this blog, my life got worse.

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:57.894
That marriage that was going
in the wrong direction ended.

00:02:57.894 --> 00:03:00.040
And it was really heartbreaking.

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.502
And what made matters
much worse was

00:03:02.502 --> 00:03:04.710
that my friend who was
struggling with mental illness

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:05.980
didn't make it.

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.840
He sadly took his own life.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.870
And as I was going
through these emotions,

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.030
as was his family
and all his friends,

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.910
I found that the blog,
1000 Awesome Things,

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.750
became an escape for me,
became therapy for me.

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.710
It became some place I looked
forward to going every day.

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:27.850
And as you probably know,
50,000 blogs are started a day.

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.670
So nobody read this
except for my mom.

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.760
But over time, it grew
and grew and grew.

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.931
To the day where it
ended up winning awards

00:03:35.931 --> 00:03:38.180
for Best Blog in the World,
scoring all those millions

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.600
of hits and turned into
a series of books called

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.820
"The Book of Awesome,"
"Book of Even More Awesome,"

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:44.820
"Book of Holiday Awesome,"
"Journal of Awesome,"

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.740
"App of Awesome," "Five
Calendars of Awesome."

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.140
It turned into
this awesome thing.

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.150
And the scary part
about all that

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.590
happening to me, as I
was writing this blog,

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.180
working at Wal-mart,
and writing these books

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.444
was, I wasn't actually happy.

00:03:58.444 --> 00:04:00.610
That's actually the hard
part about the whole thing,

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:03.370
is that the front page
of the national newspaper

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.140
said, "Neil is the Pied
Piper of happiness."

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.850
And it was really hard in those
interviews to tell people--

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:11.891
and I didn't tell people--
that I was kind of not

00:04:11.891 --> 00:04:13.360
very happy on the inside.

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.130
I had lost 40 pounds
due to stress.

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:17.130
People at work were
like, you look great.

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:18.380
What's your secret?

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:19.870
I was like, no sleep.

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:21.890
That's it, just stress.

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:25.920
And I was struggling
through a divorce

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.990
and a new apartment
and a new town,

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.330
trying to meet new friends.

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.890
And so for me, I spent a few
years getting to number one

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:38.199
on that blog, posting the last
entry in 2012, number one,

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:39.740
remember it was
1,000 awesome things,

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:41.780
so I wrote it every
day for four years--

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.395
1000-- until we
wrote hit number one.

00:04:44.395 --> 00:04:46.520
And then I put the pen
down, put the keyboard away.

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:47.894
And I stopped
writing completely.

00:04:47.894 --> 00:04:51.470
And I tried to shift
myself from the observation

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:54.670
of awesome things to
what I called in my mind

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:56.310
the application
of awesome things,

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.360
like buying a salt and pepper
shaker for the first time,

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.420
buying dishes, doing
this new thing, which

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:04.350
is really popular some people do
called cooking, which I'd never

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:07.630
really done, starting
online dating,

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:09.740
starting to meet new
people-- getting out there

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:11.647
and trying to live
a life, you know?

00:05:11.647 --> 00:05:13.230
And so I didn't write
for a few years.

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:14.860
But I did meet someone new.

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:15.890
Her name's Leslie.

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:18.160
She's a schoolteacher
in Toronto.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.556
And we fell in love, fast.

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:24.990
She baked me a cake
on my birthday,

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:27.480
and did things that I
hadn't had happen in years.

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:28.590
And it was just so nice.

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:30.525
And we fell in love.

00:05:30.525 --> 00:05:31.400
We moved in together.

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:32.590
We got engaged.

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:33.570
We got married.

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:35.030
We go on a honeymoon.

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:38.790
And on the flight home from
that honeymoon, on the plane,

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:41.230
she says, you know, I'm not
really feeling very well.

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:45.330
So on the layover in Malaysia,
we go to the pharmacy.

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.070
She gets back on the plane.

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:50.100
She goes to the tiny
little airplane bathroom.

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:55.530
She comes back to our seats
and she says, I'm pregnant.

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:58.890
We're about to take off on
the tarmac on a 12-hour flight

00:05:58.890 --> 00:05:59.612
home.

00:05:59.612 --> 00:06:01.320
By the way, if anyone
wants a good secret

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:02.990
of scoring a free
muffin on an airplane,

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:05.614
you just have to tell the flight
attendant you found out you're

00:06:05.614 --> 00:06:07.710
pregnant right then and there.

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:10.520
And all kinds of thoughts and
emotions hit me all at once.

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.601
How many people
here are parents?

00:06:12.601 --> 00:06:14.350
I know there's a lot
of people online too.

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:17.170
How many people want
their kids to be happy?

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:18.980
All the same hands,
even some that don't

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:21.010
have kids, which is amazing.

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:23.191
That's incredible.

00:06:23.191 --> 00:06:24.690
And I was kind of
like that, though.

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:25.190
It's true.

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:26.000
I didn't have kids.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.044
But I thought deeply.

00:06:27.044 --> 00:06:28.710
I was like, but I
want them to be happy.

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:30.212
That's the thing
I know the most.

00:06:30.212 --> 00:06:31.670
And you know what's
crazy, Rachael?

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:34.690
I had those five years
of the blog taking off,

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:37.520
the books, the TED talk, invited
to speak to royal families

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.000
and big corporations and CEOs.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.430
And I thought to myself,
but all those people, they

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:43.290
aren't happy, either.

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:45.110
I mean, I'm working for them.

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:46.635
I'm seeing them up close.

00:06:46.635 --> 00:06:48.070
You work right here at Google.

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:48.600
You know what I mean.

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.360
It's like, it's not like
you just flip a switch

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.901
and you're successful relative
to your family and your peers.

00:06:52.901 --> 00:06:55.090
But it doesn't mean
everyone is just happy.

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:56.570
It doesn't just mean that.

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:59.720
So we got back home to
Toronto, and guess what I did?

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:02.230
I opened a Microsoft
Word document.

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:05.030
And I wrote Document 1.

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:07.970
I wrote, "Dear
Baby, I wanted you

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:11.038
to have this in case I didn't
have a chance to tell you.

00:07:11.038 --> 00:07:12.670
Love, Dad."

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:14.810
And every single day for
the next nine months,

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:16.040
I woke up around 5:00 AM.

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:17.340
I set my alarm, but
I didn't need to.

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:18.080
I jumped out of bed.

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:20.350
I picked up the pen again
for the first time in years,

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:23.700
and I eventually wrote
a 300-page letter

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:28.280
to my unborn child, called,
eventually, "The Nine Secrets

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:29.912
to Living a Happy Life."

00:07:29.912 --> 00:07:31.370
I took together
everything that I'd

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:33.280
learned in research from
positive psychology,

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:36.242
everything I had learned from
seeing some of these executives

00:07:36.242 --> 00:07:38.700
up close, interviewing them,
talking to bestselling authors

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:41.190
and people on stages, and my
own personal experience-- what

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:42.120
my parents taught me.

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:45.140
And I stewed it all together
into this 300-page letter.

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:47.870
And that 300-page
letter is the book

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:52.090
you have in your hands today
called "The Happiness Equation"

00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:54.620
I'm so excited to share with
you that that just came out

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:56.360
a few days ago.

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:59.430
And if you look at the very
bottom of the copyright page,

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:02.360
in two-point font, like where
the Library of Congress info

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:05.284
is, it says, "Dear
Baby, I wanted

00:08:05.284 --> 00:08:06.700
you to have this,
in case I didn't

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:07.935
have a chance to tell you.

00:08:07.935 --> 00:08:09.140
Love, Dad."

00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:12.780
This book is the letter
I wrote to my son

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:15.610
before he was born, before
I knew it was a boy.

00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:19.600
And now I'm so excited
to share it with you.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.270
There's nine secrets
in this book,

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:24.060
and I know how much
time we have together.

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:25.580
So what I thought
I'd ask you is,

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:28.270
would you like me to share
three of them with you

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:29.970
today at lunch?

00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:30.970
Sounds like a good plan?

00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:34.530
OK, so secret number
one, the first thing we

00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:38.450
must do before we can be happy.

00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:39.880
My mom is from Nairobi, Kenya.

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:41.460
My dad is from Amritsar, India.

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:44.987
And they got here to
Canada, North America.

00:08:44.987 --> 00:08:47.070
And they said, Neil, you
know, it's really simple.

00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:48.250
It's really simple.

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:51.310
You do great work.

00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:58.640
Then you will have a big success
and then you will be happy.

00:08:58.640 --> 00:08:59.520
That's how it works.

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:01.880
You study really hard.

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:04.280
And then you get good grades,
and then you're happy.

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:06.430
Or you work really hard
and then you get promoted,

00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:07.346
and then you're happy.

00:09:07.346 --> 00:09:09.631
That's what my parents beat
into me from a young age.

00:09:09.631 --> 00:09:11.255
It's what we all hear
from our parents.

00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:18.820
Positive psychology, study after
study, things done at Stanford,

00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:21.707
things done by researchers
like [INAUDIBLE], [INAUDIBLE],

00:09:21.707 --> 00:09:24.040
lots of others, have actually
shown this model's totally

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:24.970
backwards.

00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:28.510
Instead, we now know
that if you be happy

00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:34.540
first, if you choose to be
happy, then you do great work.

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:36.410
Your productivity goes up 31%.

00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:37.900
Your sales goes up 37%.

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:39.300
You're three times
more creative.

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:43.170
And then you have the
big success after.

00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:46.450
Happiness is actually
the leading indicator.

00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:47.890
The model's totally backwards.

00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:50.839
The six important
words are flipped.

00:09:50.839 --> 00:09:52.630
Now, it's one thing to
be invited to Google

00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:54.460
and to just tell
everyone, like, cool.

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:55.140
Everyone got it?

00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:56.030
Just be happy.

00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:56.670
It's easy.

00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:57.310
And then, thanks a lot.

00:09:57.310 --> 00:09:58.450
Where do I get my free lunch?

00:09:58.450 --> 00:10:01.060
I heard there's some fancy food
here-- and then just take off.

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:02.560
But of course, it's
not that simple.

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:04.220
You can't just flip a
switch in the morning.

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:05.845
You don't just wake
up and say, OK, I'm

00:10:05.845 --> 00:10:06.850
going to be happy today.

00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:08.580
Everyone's got good
days and bad days.

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:09.570
But what do we do?

00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:10.520
So what do we do?

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:14.030
Well, the research suggests
that 40% of our happiness,

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:16.040
four times as much
as our circumstances,

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:18.500
are actually controlled
by intentional activities.

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:21.380
I mean things we can do
in just 20 minutes a day

00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:24.711
to actually cultivate
our own happiness.

00:10:24.711 --> 00:10:26.210
So what I want to
share with you now

00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:28.240
is the result of me
sifting through over 300

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:29.470
positive psychology studies.

00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:32.400
And I'm bringing for you
what I call the big five.

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:34.220
These are five
studies anyone can

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:35.727
do in just 20 minutes a day.

00:10:35.727 --> 00:10:37.310
And if you do it for
20 days in a row,

00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:39.900
you've cultivated a
new happiness habit.

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:41.900
So here are the five.

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:50.850
The first one is
real simple, and it's

00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:52.125
perfect on this giant campus.

00:10:52.125 --> 00:10:55.806
You just go for three
20 minute walks a week.

00:10:55.806 --> 00:10:57.180
Penn State
researchers have found

00:10:57.180 --> 00:10:59.709
that exercise has a tremendous
impact on your happiness.

00:10:59.709 --> 00:11:01.500
Professor Michael
[? Badeck ?] and his team

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:06.580
showed that a group of people
who went on three brisk walks

00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:09.290
a week actually have
a higher happiness

00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:13.320
rating at the end than people
on antidepressants and people

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:16.570
who were on antidepressants
and doing the walking.

00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:20.177
The exercise group alone
outperformed the other two.

00:11:20.177 --> 00:11:21.760
For anyone who has
a dog late at night

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:24.320
that wants to go for a walk,
you know what I'm talking about.

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:25.490
You don't want to go outside.

00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:26.830
The last thing you
want to do is just

00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:28.040
sort of get ready
and go outside.

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:30.456
It's been raining here-- it's
the last thing I want to do.

00:11:30.456 --> 00:11:32.940
But when you come back,
you are reinvigorated.

00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:34.150
You are energized.

00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:37.590
The walking gets you moving and
it increases your happiness.

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:46.660
Number two is called
the 20-minute replay.

00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:49.740
And for this one, it's good.

00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:52.340
I'm getting some
free squats in today.

00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:53.799
University of Texas
researchers did

00:11:53.799 --> 00:11:56.298
a study called, How Do I Love
Thee-- Let Me Count the Words.

00:11:56.298 --> 00:11:58.900
And they found that couples who
journaled for 20 minutes a day

00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:01.240
about one positive experience
they had during the day

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:03.190
were 50% more likely
to stay together

00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:05.460
after three months, which
is a really long time

00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:06.430
at a university campus.

00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:08.380
That's a really
long relationship.

00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:10.197
And why does this work?

00:12:10.197 --> 00:12:12.530
Why does journaling at the
end of the day for 20 minutes

00:12:12.530 --> 00:12:14.330
help you be happier?

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:17.232
Because your mind has no
Google Maps system in it.

00:12:17.232 --> 00:12:18.150
It's got no GPS.

00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:19.760
You don't actually
know where you are.

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:22.140
When you are journaling
about the coffee

00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:24.100
that your friend brought
you during the day,

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:25.980
you are there again.

00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:28.342
You are re-living
that experience.

00:12:28.342 --> 00:12:30.050
And when you're reading
your own journal,

00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:32.380
you're re-living
it a third time.

00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:35.220
You get a tripling effect
on the net positive thing

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:38.400
that happened to you,
just by writing it down.

00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:44.694
Number three-- five random acts.

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:49.750
Professor [INAUDIBLE]
at Stanford University

00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:55.220
had students perform or commit
five random acts of kindness

00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:56.700
over the course of a week.

00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:59.180
We don't often think
about buying a coffee

00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:01.760
for the security
guard of our building.

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:04.380
But if you do it, you feel
better about yourself.

00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:06.540
You're like, I'm the
coffee buying guy.

00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:08.330
I'm the door holder opener.

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:10.290
You feel great
about who you are,

00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:12.787
and your happiness shoots up.

00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:20.770
Number four is meditation.

00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:21.830
We all know the studies.

00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:23.800
Massachusetts General
Hospital researchers

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:25.275
found that if you
close your eyes

00:13:25.275 --> 00:13:26.900
and do a few minutes
of deep breathing,

00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:30.100
you increase the activity in the
prefrontal cortex of your brain

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:32.450
that's responsible for
focus and attention.

00:13:32.450 --> 00:13:34.930
For me, I always found
meditation so difficult.

00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:36.680
I was thinking about
going to the basement

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:38.763
and shutting off the lights,
turning up the music.

00:13:38.763 --> 00:13:40.640
I just couldn't get into it.

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:43.560
But my wife Leslie
downloaded the Headspace app,

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:45.760
which I have no affiliation
with personally.

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:47.780
But now we have the
little splitter,

00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:50.650
and when the baby goes to
sleep, we do a guided meditation

00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:51.150
together.

00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:52.470
It makes it really accessible.

00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:54.440
We even made the big
financial commitment

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:56.170
to subscribe for a
couple bucks a month,

00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:58.480
which was a big conversation
before we did that.

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:00.659
But it makes meditation
accessible to us.

00:14:00.659 --> 00:14:02.200
And we just know it
makes us happier.

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:04.658
If we've done none of the other
things during the day, hey,

00:14:04.658 --> 00:14:10.100
we can do a 10-minute guided
meditation before we go to bed.

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:13.890
And the last one I'll give
you is five gratitudes--

00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:16.780
five gratitudes.

00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:19.350
Professor [INAUDIBLE]
actually asked students

00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:21.520
to perform and write
down five things

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:24.630
that they were grateful
for or five events that

00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:26.980
happened during the
week or five hassles.

00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:29.050
Over a 10-week period,
as you can imagine,

00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:30.633
the people that wrote
down five things

00:14:30.633 --> 00:14:32.754
they were grateful for a
week were much happier.

00:14:32.754 --> 00:14:34.920
I was actually doing a
speech of the day and a woman

00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:35.460
put up her hand.

00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:38.126
She said, hey, I think I'm doing
that at home, but I'm not sure.

00:14:38.126 --> 00:14:38.890
Can you tell me?

00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:40.730
You see, my husband's
a grouch and I've

00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:42.225
got three teenage boys.

00:14:42.225 --> 00:14:43.600
So every day at
the dinner table,

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:45.510
I force them to go
around the dinner table

00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:48.740
and say one good thing that
happened during their day.

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:50.740
Is that what this study says?

00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:52.730
And I said, no, not at all.

00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:55.180
The study is five
gratitudes a week.

00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:58.280
If you're doing five a day--
you guys are better at math

00:14:58.280 --> 00:14:58.780
than me.

00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:01.010
I think that's like
a 700% increase

00:15:01.010 --> 00:15:02.580
over the minimum effective dose.

00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:05.030
The point is, five is easy.

00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:06.340
It's just five a week.

00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:08.300
The hard part is
writing them down.

00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:09.960
What do these five things do?

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:11.520
These are the big
five superstudies.

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:14.420
Three walks, a 20 minute replay,
five random acts of kindness,

00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:15.730
meditation, or five gratitudes.

00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:17.370
You do any of those.

00:15:17.370 --> 00:15:17.970
Pick one.

00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:19.120
You don't have to do five.

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:20.010
Pick one.

00:15:20.010 --> 00:15:22.730
For just 20 minutes a
day for 28 days in a row,

00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:24.930
you've developed a
new happiness habit.

00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:27.290
So what is the
first thing you must

00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:30.220
do before you can be happy?

00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:33.910
You must be happy first.

00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:39.440
You must put happiness at
the front of the equation.

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:42.060
Invest in it with some of
these specific practices

00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:45.700
and cultivate your happiness.

00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:51.650
Secret number two-- the secret
to never being too busy again.

00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:54.529
Has anyone here ever been
busy before in their life?

00:15:54.529 --> 00:15:57.070
You're like, yeah, this other
guy was supposed to come today.

00:15:57.070 --> 00:15:59.520
He was too busy to come.

00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:00.280
That's the thing.

00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:01.650
We're all too busy.

00:16:01.650 --> 00:16:03.980
There is so much
business in our days.

00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:06.320
And on top of that,
there's these three numbers

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:09.730
that actually petrify
me every single morning.

00:16:09.730 --> 00:16:11.030
These numbers scare me.

00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:12.363
Does anybody know what they are?

00:16:12.363 --> 00:16:16.488
147.

00:16:16.488 --> 00:16:18.100
Couple people
shaking their head.

00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:21.934
This is the average number
of emails we get a day-- 147.

00:16:21.934 --> 00:16:23.100
I know what you're thinking.

00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:24.700
Some people are like, I
get way more than that.

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:25.408
It's the average.

00:16:25.408 --> 00:16:26.480
My mom gets six.

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:29.150
You might get 300.

00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:34.950
150-- number of times
you check your phone.

00:16:34.950 --> 00:16:36.320
That is correct.

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:38.820
Some studies actually say it's
once every four minutes now.

00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:39.539
150 times a day.

00:16:39.539 --> 00:16:41.830
But the good news is, three
times you check your phone,

00:16:41.830 --> 00:16:43.110
there's nothing there.

00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:46.656
The other 147 times you have
someone waiting for you.

00:16:46.656 --> 00:16:48.905
At the end of this talk,
you'll have, like, 18 emails.

00:16:48.905 --> 00:16:49.920
You know what I mean?

00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:50.480
OK, cool.

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:52.970
This number scares
me the most-- 295,

00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:54.490
based on my own
personal research.

00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:59.179
Average number of decisions
people are making a day.

00:16:59.179 --> 00:17:01.220
Average number of decisions
people make in a day.

00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:04.599
You know, decision-making
energy is a finite resource.

00:17:04.599 --> 00:17:06.450
We don't have an
unlimited supply of it.

00:17:06.450 --> 00:17:09.930
As we're using it, we don't
feel like we're using it.

00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:11.589
You go to the grocery
store, you pick

00:17:11.589 --> 00:17:15.354
between 20 kinds of salsa,
30 kinds of potato chips.

00:17:15.354 --> 00:17:17.020
There used to be,
like, one kind of egg.

00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:18.521
Now there's, like,
20 kinds of eggs.

00:17:18.521 --> 00:17:19.686
You pick out all that stuff.

00:17:19.686 --> 00:17:20.569
You get to the front.

00:17:20.569 --> 00:17:23.810
Your decision-making
energy is gone.

00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:26.630
There's only two
ways to replenish it.

00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:28.890
Number one is
sleep-- tough place

00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:31.690
to take a nap, in front
of the grocery store.

00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:33.999
Number two is
glucose, or anything

00:17:33.999 --> 00:17:35.540
that turns into
glucose in your body,

00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:37.747
hence there being a huge
display of candy bars

00:17:37.747 --> 00:17:39.080
right at the front of the store.

00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:40.460
That's exactly
why they're there.

00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:47.120
My wife and I, we did a wedding
registry before we got married.

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:48.680
Has anyone ever had
that experience?

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:49.513
You go to the store.

00:17:49.513 --> 00:17:52.070
You're super-excited You
get the [INAUDIBLE] gun.

00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:53.880
You're like, yeah,
honey, this is great.

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:55.540
We don't have to
pay for anything.

00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:57.580
Do you want yellow
bowls or blue bowls?

00:17:57.580 --> 00:17:59.040
Shiny ones or matte?

00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:00.600
Tall glasses or short ones?

00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:02.050
12 of them or eight?

00:18:02.050 --> 00:18:04.760
By the end of the day,
you are exhausted.

00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:05.582
You are drained.

00:18:05.582 --> 00:18:06.540
The lady came up to us.

00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:07.730
Our eyes were glossed over.

00:18:07.730 --> 00:18:10.330
She's like, I got a $300
ice bucket you'll love.

00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:11.330
We're like, great.

00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:12.430
We've never used it.

00:18:12.430 --> 00:18:13.807
We never will use it.

00:18:13.807 --> 00:18:15.140
The point is, we didn't need it.

00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:17.110
Our decision-making
energy was down.

00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:18.980
When we have no
decision-making energy left,

00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:20.552
we do one of two things.

00:18:20.552 --> 00:18:24.680
We either make no decision
or we make a bad decision.

00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:26.490
Those are the only
two options left.

00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:28.410
No wonder we're so busy.

00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:30.074
We've got too much going on.

00:18:30.074 --> 00:18:31.490
When I did this
study on myself, I

00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:34.520
found I was making 50 decisions
on just food every day,

00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:36.220
30 decisions on my commute.

00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:37.950
Which way am I going to go?

00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:41.300
So, what did I do to write
this letter for my son?

00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:42.944
Well, I ended up
saying, you know what?

00:18:42.944 --> 00:18:43.610
I've been lucky.

00:18:43.610 --> 00:18:45.276
I've got access to
some of these people.

00:18:45.276 --> 00:18:46.600
I'm working for some big shots.

00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:48.330
I got access to
some other speakers.

00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:49.540
I interviewed them.

00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:50.410
I asked them.

00:18:50.410 --> 00:18:52.710
You probably have a lot
of decisions in your life.

00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:54.780
What do you do to simplify them?

00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:57.720
What do you do to
streamline them?

00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:00.450
Is there a practice,
a technique, anything?

00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:02.810
I took the answers of
all those interviews

00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:06.070
and I drew them
into one big box.

00:19:11.170 --> 00:19:12.010
That's not very big.

00:19:12.010 --> 00:19:14.930
Let's draw it a
little bit bigger.

00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:16.660
I drew it into a box.

00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:26.510
And this box is-- here we
go-- on one axis it's time.

00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:28.570
So we got a high
amount of time takes

00:19:28.570 --> 00:19:30.540
to make a decision or
a low amount of time.

00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:33.840
And on the other
axis, it is important.

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:37.510
Like, it's not very
important or it's a big deal.

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:41.140
Every decision goes
somewhere in this box.

00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:42.620
You can imagine that.

00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:45.990
So what do you do with the low
time, low importance decision?

00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:48.430
You guys are great at
this already at Google.

00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:50.140
We can all get a
little bit better.

00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:51.860
But the solution, and what
these people were doing,

00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:53.401
these successful
people, is they were

00:19:53.401 --> 00:19:54.650
automating those decisions.

00:19:54.650 --> 00:19:58.320
Anything that's low time, low
importance, you automate it.

00:19:58.320 --> 00:19:59.930
You automate it.

00:19:59.930 --> 00:20:02.420
So now I make zero
decisions on my way to work.

00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:03.030
Why?

00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:07.260
Because I use your app,
Ways, and I just follow it.

00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:09.660
If it tells me to go down
a back alley, I listen.

00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:11.450
I don't pay attention anymore.

00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:13.610
Woman said to me, you know what?

00:20:13.610 --> 00:20:16.269
I do double dinners.

00:20:16.269 --> 00:20:17.560
You guys get food here, I know.

00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:20.840
But she just makes twice and
takes the leftovers for lunch.

00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:22.170
People have consumables.

00:20:22.170 --> 00:20:24.460
My friend Chad has consumables,
everything delivered

00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:25.660
to his house from Amazon.

00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:27.455
Yeah, it's easy for the
yogurt and for the salsa

00:20:27.455 --> 00:20:28.580
and for the milk and stuff.

00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:30.210
He's got his towels coming in.

00:20:30.210 --> 00:20:32.260
Once a year, he gets
a new face towel.

00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:34.080
Everything is just automated.

00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:36.850
How many decisions can
you eliminate by saying,

00:20:36.850 --> 00:20:38.200
I want to automate that my life?

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:40.140
Bill payments is
a classic example.

00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:42.690
So what do you do
with the decisions

00:20:42.690 --> 00:20:45.990
that are not very important,
but they take forever,

00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:48.390
like the 147 e-mails you get?

00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:52.950
The solution of course
there is to regulate them,

00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:55.736
simply fence them off
into a part of your life

00:20:55.736 --> 00:20:57.110
where you can
manage them better.

00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:59.040
I have a friend that wrote
a book on productivity.

00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:01.250
He answers all his emails
between 3:00 and 4:00 PM.

00:21:01.250 --> 00:21:03.660
He said to me, people that
email me in the morning,

00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:04.860
they get an answer.

00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:05.834
Comes after lunch.

00:21:05.834 --> 00:21:07.500
People that email me
at 4:00, 5:00, 6:00

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:09.220
PM, they get an answer.

00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:11.070
They don't expect anyone
until the next day.

00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:12.069
And they give it to him.

00:21:12.069 --> 00:21:14.590
He's just reasoned that that
one hour works best for him

00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:15.550
to regulate it.

00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:20.350
My wife and I, we live at 250
on the street in Toronto-- 250.

00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:22.835
We have an old
house, small house.

00:21:22.835 --> 00:21:24.960
And every day or two,
something goes wrong with it.

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:26.824
A door is squeaky, needs grease.

00:21:26.824 --> 00:21:28.240
Someone's got to
shovel something.

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:29.740
There's just always
something wrong.

00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:31.780
It was bogging us down
when we first moved in.

00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:34.071
But then on the inside of
one of our kitchen cupboards,

00:21:34.071 --> 00:21:35.844
we made a little
chart called 250 day.

00:21:35.844 --> 00:21:37.260
Anytime something's
wrong, we just

00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:38.426
write it down on that chart.

00:21:38.426 --> 00:21:42.340
We set a recurring meeting
between the two of us every--

00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:46.800
the first Saturday of every
month, from 9 to 12, 250 day.

00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:48.370
And you know what
we do that day?

00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:50.286
We just go to that list
and do all the chores.

00:21:50.286 --> 00:21:53.100
We've just regulated it into
once a month for three hours,

00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:54.700
and we do a chores
blitz that day.

00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:56.580
We fix everything in
our house, rather than

00:21:56.580 --> 00:22:00.190
mentally thinking about it
throughout all of our time.

00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:02.740
What do you do with the
super important stuff that

00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:05.420
doesn't take very long,
like picking your kids up

00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:08.810
from daycare, saying hi to
your team in the morning?

00:22:08.810 --> 00:22:11.000
Some of this stuff,
you just gotta do.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.500
That's why that
word is effectuate.

00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:14.190
It's a big word with
a small meeting.

00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:15.730
It just means get her done.

00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:16.820
Just do it.

00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:18.600
The beautiful thing
about this model

00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:21.600
is that if you actually
automate, regulate,

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:25.330
and effectuate all of these
decisions, guess what?

00:22:25.330 --> 00:22:27.820
Your brain actually
finally has time

00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:31.590
to debate the big ones, to
actually think about the where

00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:32.437
am I going to live?

00:22:32.437 --> 00:22:33.520
Who am I going to be with?

00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:34.500
What am I going to do?

00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:37.110
The big heavy problems actually
weighing you down-- you

00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:38.720
finally make room for them.

00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:40.890
Now they're ugly and
you've got to tackle them.

00:22:40.890 --> 00:22:43.440
But the point is,
you created space.

00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:46.210
So what's the secret to
never being too busy again?

00:22:46.210 --> 00:22:50.140
It is to create
space in your life.

00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:53.206
And this model is one tool
that I found that helps.

00:22:56.270 --> 00:23:01.620
Secret number three--
secret number three,

00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:05.220
the secret to turning your
biggest fear into your biggest

00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:06.272
success.

00:23:06.272 --> 00:23:07.980
I'm embarrassed to
admit this, especially

00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:09.130
because we're filming
this and so it's

00:23:09.130 --> 00:23:10.760
going to be on YouTube forever.

00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:13.510
But I'll say it right
now for the first time.

00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:19.690
I didn't know how to swim
at all in my early 30s.

00:23:19.690 --> 00:23:21.300
I'm 36 now.

00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:23.090
And why didn't I
know how to swim?

00:23:23.090 --> 00:23:24.700
My sister can swim
and everything.

00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:27.840
It's because I had ear
infections my whole childhood,

00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:30.120
so I had tubes in my
ears my whole childhood,

00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:32.740
and I had a traumatic
experience on top of all that.

00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:35.760
I fell into the pool
and I couldn't swim.

00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:39.290
So I can almost
still see it today.

00:23:39.290 --> 00:23:41.320
And so that's fine,
because you know what?

00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:42.414
Who cares?

00:23:42.414 --> 00:23:43.330
I didn't need to swim.

00:23:43.330 --> 00:23:44.260
I live in Toronto.

00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:45.550
There's no ocean.

00:23:45.550 --> 00:23:46.490
I'm good.

00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:49.140
I wouldn't even bring my
bathing suit to the pool party.

00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:51.120
My friends wanted to go
swimming at university?

00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:53.170
I hang out by the
treadmill-- no problem.

00:23:53.170 --> 00:23:56.610
I eliminated swimming
from my life.

00:23:56.610 --> 00:23:58.656
You see, I didn't
think I can do it.

00:23:58.656 --> 00:24:00.530
I didn't think I had
the capability to do it.

00:24:00.530 --> 00:24:03.350
And I certainly
didn't want to do it.

00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:07.670
I had no motivation,
so I never did it.

00:24:07.670 --> 00:24:10.230
And that's how we
think about anything.

00:24:10.230 --> 00:24:13.210
You've got to have the
capability then the motivation

00:24:13.210 --> 00:24:15.560
and then you have the action.

00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:18.940
I never got to do, because
these things were never

00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:20.310
going to happen.

00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:22.210
All that changed
on my second date

00:24:22.210 --> 00:24:26.080
with Leslie, when she said to
me over dinner one night, so,

00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:28.370
do you like swimming?

00:24:28.370 --> 00:24:30.380
And I was thinking
to myself, uh-oh.

00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:32.280
Play it cool, Pasricha.

00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:35.180
You don't want to scare her off.

00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:39.060
And I said to her, nah.

00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:40.660
Nah, I'm not really a big fan.

00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:44.050
She says, Ah, that's too bad.

00:24:44.050 --> 00:24:47.100
You see, my family's
had a cottage

00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:50.080
on an island for generations.

00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:52.620
And there's 20 of us up
there, the whole summer.

00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:55.320
My 80-year-old grandparents,
my five-year-old cousins--

00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:59.590
we get up every morning in the
summer, jump into the lake,

00:24:59.590 --> 00:25:00.970
and swim around the island.

00:25:00.970 --> 00:25:02.740
Takes about half an hour.

00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:04.185
Man, I guess you can't come.

00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:09.570
Suddenly that night,
without thinking

00:25:09.570 --> 00:25:12.720
about whether I can do it
or whether I want to do it,

00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:14.530
I just did it.

00:25:14.530 --> 00:25:19.670
I signed up for adult learn
to swim classes at the City

00:25:19.670 --> 00:25:20.749
of Toronto downtown pool.

00:25:20.749 --> 00:25:22.290
And I don't know
how many people here

00:25:22.290 --> 00:25:24.123
have seen the downtown
City of Toronto pool.

00:25:24.123 --> 00:25:25.770
This isn't a
recommended thing to do.

00:25:25.770 --> 00:25:29.680
It's right in the urban
center of the city.

00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:32.965
I'm getting my life jacket,
the goggles, whole thing.

00:25:32.965 --> 00:25:36.380
I'm walking onto the pool deck
that first Wednesday night.

00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:39.080
My heart is beating louder
than it had in years.

00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:40.354
I was so nervous.

00:25:40.354 --> 00:25:42.020
But you know what
happened when I walked

00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:43.228
in on the pool deck, Rachael?

00:25:43.228 --> 00:25:46.295
I get out there, and you
know who's out there?

00:25:46.295 --> 00:25:49.240
A whole bunch of people
who suck at swimming.

00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:50.860
For once, I'm not the only one.

00:25:50.860 --> 00:25:52.470
People are from
landlocked countries.

00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:55.000
They had more traumatic
experiences than me.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.900
Trust formed very quickly.

00:25:57.900 --> 00:26:00.960
So we get into the shallow
end with the flutter board,

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:02.710
the life jacket, the goggles.

00:26:02.710 --> 00:26:04.600
And within five minutes
of doing that, where

00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:07.510
I could touch the bottom, I
was like, hey, wait a minute.

00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:10.010
I can do that.

00:26:10.010 --> 00:26:11.400
That's not hard.

00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:12.302
I can do that.

00:26:12.302 --> 00:26:13.260
And then you know what?

00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:16.750
The next week, I
wanted to do it.

00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:18.990
I wanted to do it,
because I was like, well,

00:26:18.990 --> 00:26:20.870
I kind of thought
I can do it now.

00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:22.720
And so the next
week I was flutter

00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:23.920
kicking in the deep end.

00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:26.280
The week after, flutter
kicking with no life jacket.

00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:28.738
By the end of the eight weeks,
I was doing the front crawl.

00:26:31.050 --> 00:26:36.330
The thing I realized is that
motivation doesn't actually

00:26:36.330 --> 00:26:40.100
lead to action,
like we all think.

00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:44.020
Action leads to motivation.

00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:47.190
It's completely flipped.

00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:49.280
You want to write that novel?

00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:51.810
You don't need the perfect
coffee shop, the right idea,

00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:53.800
and the expensive mole skin.

00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:57.340
Just write one sentence
with a pen from the hotel

00:26:57.340 --> 00:26:58.600
on a Post-it note.

00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:01.430
Just doing that will tell
you that you can do it,

00:27:01.430 --> 00:27:02.800
and then you'll want to do it.

00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:03.970
You want to run a marathon?

00:27:03.970 --> 00:27:05.719
Forget the good shoes,
the right playlist,

00:27:05.719 --> 00:27:07.540
and the running
buddy-- forget it.

00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:10.140
Just run to the stoplight
in your dress shoes.

00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:12.990
By the time you do that,
you're like, I can do that.

00:27:12.990 --> 00:27:14.850
And then you think
you can do it,

00:27:14.850 --> 00:27:16.400
and then you'll want to do it.

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:18.900
It's the exact opposite.

00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:20.530
It's the exact opposite.

00:27:20.530 --> 00:27:21.880
Don't just take it from me.

00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:22.940
You guys are scientists.

00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:26.080
You probably trust
someone like Isaac Newton.

00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:28.339
He's the greatest physicist
of all time, after all,

00:27:28.339 --> 00:27:29.630
I mean, up there with Einstein.

00:27:29.630 --> 00:27:32.369
The guy discovered
gravity, invented calculus.

00:27:32.369 --> 00:27:33.160
Pretty good resume.

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:35.280
He'd probably be hired
at Google these days.

00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:37.330
And he actually said in
his first law of motion.

00:27:37.330 --> 00:27:41.270
I can remember grade 10
science, an object in motion

00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:45.040
will remain in motion
unless acted upon

00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:47.350
by an equal or greater force.

00:27:47.350 --> 00:27:49.260
Put another way, if
you start doing it,

00:27:49.260 --> 00:27:51.550
if you place action
first, you'll continue.

00:27:51.550 --> 00:27:52.881
It's harder to stop.

00:27:52.881 --> 00:27:55.380
And that's why at the end of
my adult learn to swim classes,

00:27:55.380 --> 00:27:56.770
I signed up again.

00:27:56.770 --> 00:27:58.980
And I signed up again,
and I signed up again.

00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:00.560
And it was the same exact class.

00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:02.270
I didn't go to
learn to swim two.

00:28:02.270 --> 00:28:03.620
I just did learn to swim one.

00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:05.210
I'm like, I love this.

00:28:05.210 --> 00:28:06.520
It's amazing.

00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:07.830
I could do the front crawl.

00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:11.820
I loved it so much, I just kept
doing it over and over again.

00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:14.010
It is easier.

00:28:14.010 --> 00:28:18.840
It is easier to act
yourself into a new way

00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:21.790
of thinking than
to think yourself

00:28:21.790 --> 00:28:23.260
into a new way of acting.

00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:25.690
Our brains are often the enemy.

00:28:25.690 --> 00:28:26.920
How do you do it?

00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:29.890
How do you make your biggest
fear into your biggest success?

00:28:29.890 --> 00:28:31.570
You just do it.

00:28:31.570 --> 00:28:33.200
You put action first.

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:35.079
We all know Nike's
slogan, Just do it.

00:28:35.079 --> 00:28:37.620
What you probably don't know is
that Nike was an $800 million

00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:40.532
company with low
20% market share

00:28:40.532 --> 00:28:41.990
when they came up
with this slogan.

00:28:41.990 --> 00:28:45.170
Then they struck a
nerve deep inside of us,

00:28:45.170 --> 00:28:47.300
something we all
believe is true.

00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:48.290
You know what?

00:28:48.290 --> 00:28:51.490
On the heels of the slogan,
$10 billion company-- 50%,

00:28:51.490 --> 00:28:53.400
60% market share.

00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:55.400
That's over the lifetime
of using the slogan.

00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:57.236
We can remember the
that jazzed you up.

00:28:57.236 --> 00:28:58.360
You're like, I can do that.

00:28:58.360 --> 00:28:59.620
Just get out there and do it.

00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:00.730
And it works.

00:29:00.730 --> 00:29:02.140
It works.

00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:05.980
So all of these three are
three of the nine secrets

00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:08.030
I have in my new book,
"The Happiness Equation."

00:29:08.030 --> 00:29:11.564
I've tried to give you light,
simple, summarized versions,

00:29:11.564 --> 00:29:12.980
of course, without
all the stories

00:29:12.980 --> 00:29:14.705
that I have in the
book or the psychology

00:29:14.705 --> 00:29:16.660
studies that are
supporting them.

00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:20.090
But what I hope that they share
is the idea that all of us

00:29:20.090 --> 00:29:23.600
have the option of being
slightly happier people.

00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:26.679
And together, that creates
a happier organization.

00:29:26.679 --> 00:29:28.470
So thank you very much
for your time today.

00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:29.136
I appreciate it.

00:29:29.136 --> 00:29:33.692
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:33.692 --> 00:29:34.650
RACHAEL O'MEARA: Great.

00:29:34.650 --> 00:29:36.610
So we'll do some
question and answer,

00:29:36.610 --> 00:29:38.750
if anyone has
questions in the room.

00:29:38.750 --> 00:29:40.850
NEIL PASRICHA: Yes, I'd
love to take questions.

00:29:40.850 --> 00:29:42.600
AUDIENCE: This is kind
of tongue in cheek,

00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:44.550
but it's also serious.

00:29:44.550 --> 00:29:45.670
Are you happy?

00:29:45.670 --> 00:29:47.420
NEIL PASRICHA: Thank
you for the question.

00:29:47.420 --> 00:29:50.130
The question for those in
here is, are you happy?

00:29:50.130 --> 00:29:53.352
First of all, happiness is a
choice and it's a practice.

00:29:53.352 --> 00:29:55.310
And I really want to
emphasize the second word.

00:29:55.310 --> 00:29:58.940
My view is that happiness can
only be experienced, of course,

00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:02.600
if you have the other elements
of life to feel it again.

00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:04.320
Right now, I'm on a book tour.

00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:05.550
That makes me happy.

00:30:05.550 --> 00:30:07.590
But you know who I
wrote the book for?

00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:08.360
My son.

00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:11.250
He's at home, thousands of miles
away in Toronto with my wife

00:30:11.250 --> 00:30:13.330
who's pregnant with our second.

00:30:13.330 --> 00:30:15.760
So it's hard to feel happy
when I miss them so much,

00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:18.770
and I'm Skyping in to
eat breakfast together.

00:30:18.770 --> 00:30:19.630
I'm trying my best.

00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:21.240
I wrote a letter
for every single day

00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:23.490
I'm away with a little
present he opens every day.

00:30:23.490 --> 00:30:25.530
My wife hid little
letters in my suitcase

00:30:25.530 --> 00:30:28.300
that I can open when I feel
lonely or when I miss them.

00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:29.920
So we're trying
to keep connected.

00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:31.020
We're doing our exercise.

00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:32.970
We do rose, thorn,
bud every night.

00:30:32.970 --> 00:30:36.170
A rose from our day, a thorn
from our day-- so gratitude,

00:30:36.170 --> 00:30:38.209
something went wrong, and
a bud, something we're

00:30:38.209 --> 00:30:39.000
looking forward to.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.070
So we do it now over
voice recording.

00:30:41.070 --> 00:30:42.366
We text it back and forth.

00:30:42.366 --> 00:30:43.990
But these are all
things we've created,

00:30:43.990 --> 00:30:45.864
because it's hard for
me to be happy when I'm

00:30:45.864 --> 00:30:47.400
missing people I love the most.

00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:49.120
And I'm away from
them for weeks.

00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:51.500
So, as a practice,
I'm getting there.

00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:53.126
But it's always a
daily-- it's always

00:30:53.126 --> 00:30:54.375
something I work on every day.

00:30:54.375 --> 00:30:56.320
I'm not uniformly happy.

00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:58.020
I'm not an eternal
optimist who just

00:30:58.020 --> 00:30:59.890
wakes up and flips a switch.

00:30:59.890 --> 00:31:02.780
I do these practices
that I'm recommending.

00:31:02.780 --> 00:31:03.774
I think about them.

00:31:03.774 --> 00:31:04.690
I'm conscious of them.

00:31:04.690 --> 00:31:07.560
I did a meditation this
morning before coming here.

00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:10.110
And I'm working on it.

00:31:10.110 --> 00:31:11.710
That's the fair answer.

00:31:11.710 --> 00:31:14.300
AUDIENCE: I found for me
that really, happiness

00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:17.690
is about how I choose
my goals, and choosing

00:31:17.690 --> 00:31:19.230
the right goals for me.

00:31:19.230 --> 00:31:24.350
So society, parents,
advertising,

00:31:24.350 --> 00:31:28.040
all proposes lots of goals--
books propose lots of goals.

00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:30.610
So choosing the
right goals, I think,

00:31:30.610 --> 00:31:33.550
is really paramount
in being happy.

00:31:33.550 --> 00:31:36.140
And I wonder if you could
talk more about that.

00:31:36.140 --> 00:31:37.030
NEIL PASRICHA: Sure.

00:31:37.030 --> 00:31:37.530
Sure.

00:31:37.530 --> 00:31:40.330
The second secret in my book is
called, the four simple words

00:31:40.330 --> 00:31:41.580
that block all criticism.

00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:43.920
I'm really talking about
doing what you love,

00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:45.804
and the four words
are, do it for you.

00:31:45.804 --> 00:31:47.720
And I share a number of
studies, some of which

00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:50.920
you may already know,
about extrinsic versus

00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:52.440
intrinsic motivators.

00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:54.610
Studies actually
show when they ask

00:31:54.610 --> 00:31:58.360
girls, for example, to tutor
another girl in the piano.

00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:01.400
And they're told, hey, you're
going to teach her the piano.

00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:02.970
It's going to feel great.

00:32:02.970 --> 00:32:04.490
And they do a great job.

00:32:04.490 --> 00:32:07.170
When they're told, you teach
her the piano for half an hour

00:32:07.170 --> 00:32:09.900
and then you get a ticket to
go to the movies for free,

00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:11.810
well, they get frustrated.

00:32:11.810 --> 00:32:13.760
They sort of lose faith.

00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:15.260
And then when the
half hour is over,

00:32:15.260 --> 00:32:17.170
they bolt, whether
they've learned it or not.

00:32:17.170 --> 00:32:20.500
The point is, extrinsic
motivators actually mentally

00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:22.390
block our intrinsic motivators.

00:32:22.390 --> 00:32:25.090
We can't see our original
reasons for doing them.

00:32:25.090 --> 00:32:27.340
You know why I started
writing 1,000 Awesome Things?

00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:28.470
To cheer myself up.

00:32:28.470 --> 00:32:30.490
I'll write 1,000 awesome things.

00:32:30.490 --> 00:32:31.370
That's cool.

00:32:31.370 --> 00:32:34.110
Then I started noticing
the blog counter.

00:32:34.110 --> 00:32:36.117
50 hits-- I'll
try to get 50,000.

00:32:36.117 --> 00:32:36.950
Well, that was easy.

00:32:36.950 --> 00:32:38.033
I'll try to get a million.

00:32:38.033 --> 00:32:40.180
I'll submit it to Fark
and Digg and Reddit.

00:32:40.180 --> 00:32:42.070
I'll just keep
cranking on this thing.

00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:43.750
Well, that's not monetized.

00:32:43.750 --> 00:32:44.900
I need to have a book.

00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:47.266
Oh, it's got to be a
bestseller, the 0.01%,

00:32:47.266 --> 00:32:48.390
otherwise it doesn't count.

00:32:48.390 --> 00:32:50.040
Oh, it's only been
bestseller for one week.

00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:51.810
You've got to get on the "New
York Times" bestseller list.

00:32:51.810 --> 00:32:53.240
Oh, it's got to be a
bestseller for 200 weeks,

00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:55.520
otherwise it's like, I'm not
going to make any money off it

00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:56.436
if it doesn't do that.

00:32:56.436 --> 00:32:58.860
I became obsessed.

00:32:58.860 --> 00:33:01.360
Drove myself into the ground,
sleeping three hours a night.

00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:02.750
I'm buying eye
makeup because I'm

00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:05.940
embarrassed to go to work
with black bags under my eyes.

00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:08.740
I lost my intrinsic
reasons for doing it,

00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:10.260
and I stopped writing.

00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:12.630
Because I was setting goals
and just achieving them,

00:33:12.630 --> 00:33:14.460
and they never ended.

00:33:14.460 --> 00:33:17.390
So we need to remember
to do it for us.

00:33:17.390 --> 00:33:20.520
Ralph Waldo Emerson
said, the hardest thing

00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:23.150
to do in the world
is to be yourself

00:33:23.150 --> 00:33:24.710
in a world that's
constantly trying

00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:26.130
to make you something else.

00:33:26.130 --> 00:33:29.300
I think I butchered the quote,
but it's pretty close to that.

00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:30.380
And that's the point.

00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:31.430
How do you do it for you?

00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:32.805
Especially when
everything you do

00:33:32.805 --> 00:33:35.430
has a performance evaluation
and a paycheck attached to it.

00:33:35.430 --> 00:33:37.290
You have to get away
from that somehow.

00:33:37.290 --> 00:33:39.040
You've got to find
your intrinsic reasons.

00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:40.340
You've got to write
those down, and you

00:33:40.340 --> 00:33:41.965
gotta make sure
everything you're doing

00:33:41.965 --> 00:33:44.990
is for those intrinsic reasons.

00:33:44.990 --> 00:33:47.250
Advice is always
going to conflict.

00:33:47.250 --> 00:33:51.050
You can't take what
other people say.

00:33:51.050 --> 00:33:52.690
The pen is mightier
than the sword.

00:33:52.690 --> 00:33:54.130
Actions speak louder than words.

00:33:54.130 --> 00:33:56.440
Every single cliche conflicts.

00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:58.862
Ultimately, you have
to listen to yourself

00:33:58.862 --> 00:34:00.320
and that's the
hardest thing to do.

00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:01.778
In the book on
secret number eight,

00:34:01.778 --> 00:34:04.490
I have three tests to find
your authentic self, tests

00:34:04.490 --> 00:34:07.350
that I perform on
myself every six months.

00:34:07.350 --> 00:34:08.697
How did I do on the lake?

00:34:08.697 --> 00:34:09.280
You know what?

00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:10.110
I did it.

00:34:10.110 --> 00:34:10.611
I did it.

00:34:10.611 --> 00:34:11.693
And you know what I found?

00:34:11.693 --> 00:34:12.909
I did it with a life jacket.

00:34:12.909 --> 00:34:15.217
Because when I jumped in
that lake, first of all,

00:34:15.217 --> 00:34:17.300
there was something that
there wasn't in the pool.

00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:18.699
It's called waves.

00:34:18.699 --> 00:34:21.400
I didn't account for
that in my training.

00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:23.560
So it was harder for
me to swim in the lake.

00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:26.480
There was wind in the lake
and a bit of a current almost.

00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:28.530
So I did it, with a
life jacket, which

00:34:28.530 --> 00:34:29.830
I couldn't have done before.

00:34:29.830 --> 00:34:31.730
And I felt very proud of it.

00:34:31.730 --> 00:34:33.889
Because then I
thought, I can do this.

00:34:33.889 --> 00:34:35.889
And then-- it was a
couple summers ago--

00:34:35.889 --> 00:34:37.129
I did it more than once.

00:34:37.129 --> 00:34:38.670
I jumped in the lake
and went around.

00:34:38.670 --> 00:34:42.360
It was just that mental barrier
was erased because I put action

00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:43.719
in front of motivation.

00:34:43.719 --> 00:34:45.190
It's the hardest thing to do.

00:34:45.190 --> 00:34:46.870
Thanks for asking.

00:34:46.870 --> 00:34:47.659
Yes?

00:34:47.659 --> 00:34:50.610
How do you set expectations
that are high enough

00:34:50.610 --> 00:34:52.699
that they're
difficult to achieve,

00:34:52.699 --> 00:34:54.989
but low enough that
they're achievable,

00:34:54.989 --> 00:34:57.570
and how does that fit into
your internal motivations?

00:34:57.570 --> 00:34:58.350
You know what?

00:34:58.350 --> 00:35:00.240
We're going to blow
ourselves up in society.

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:00.890
We are.

00:35:00.890 --> 00:35:01.890
We've got a problem.

00:35:01.890 --> 00:35:04.987
We used to live in a culture
called the culture of enough.

00:35:04.987 --> 00:35:06.320
We probably don't remember that.

00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:07.778
It was before most
of us were born.

00:35:07.778 --> 00:35:11.270
It was the 250,000 years
of our species' history up

00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:12.474
until the early 1900s.

00:35:12.474 --> 00:35:13.890
It's called the
culture of enough.

00:35:13.890 --> 00:35:15.235
You need enough food to eat.

00:35:15.235 --> 00:35:17.570
You need enough of a
house to live under.

00:35:17.570 --> 00:35:18.350
You need enough.

00:35:18.350 --> 00:35:20.808
And then at the turn of the
century, three things happened.

00:35:20.808 --> 00:35:25.450
Number one, mass production made
fridges and washing machines

00:35:25.450 --> 00:35:28.440
and these things that
came into our houses that

00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:30.089
actually increased our time.

00:35:30.089 --> 00:35:32.130
Now we could want more,
because we could do more.

00:35:32.130 --> 00:35:32.710
We had more time.

00:35:32.710 --> 00:35:34.751
And the other interesting
invention that happened

00:35:34.751 --> 00:35:36.220
was radios.

00:35:36.220 --> 00:35:39.140
Radios were the first
time advertisements ever

00:35:39.140 --> 00:35:41.040
entered the home.

00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:44.220
So now we were trained
to desire more.

00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:47.580
Paul Mazur, Lehman Brothers,
1927 in the "Harvard Business

00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:51.110
Review" wrote, we must
move society from a needs

00:35:51.110 --> 00:35:52.170
to a wants culture.

00:35:55.250 --> 00:35:57.180
Today, we live in
the culture of more,

00:35:57.180 --> 00:35:59.050
from the old culture of enough.

00:35:59.050 --> 00:36:01.957
Pop Momand from San Diego
was one of the first people

00:36:01.957 --> 00:36:03.040
to put his finger on that.

00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:04.011
He moved to New York.

00:36:04.011 --> 00:36:06.510
He was a successful cartoonist,
moved to a rich neighborhood

00:36:06.510 --> 00:36:08.350
and thought, I'm
surrounded by people

00:36:08.350 --> 00:36:09.590
who all have more than me.

00:36:09.590 --> 00:36:11.046
So he started to
write a cartoon.

00:36:11.046 --> 00:36:12.420
He moved down to
Manhattan, which

00:36:12.420 --> 00:36:16.080
was a poorer area at the time,
and started a cartoon called,

00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:17.790
"Keeping Up with the Joneses."

00:36:17.790 --> 00:36:19.300
He made up that phrase.

00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:21.770
It was called "Keeping Up
with the Smiths" originally,

00:36:21.770 --> 00:36:24.190
but didn't roll very well.

00:36:24.190 --> 00:36:27.120
That cartoon published
syndication for over 20 years.

00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:30.340
In the book, I have the very
first comic of that cartoon.

00:36:30.340 --> 00:36:32.910
It's old enough that we were
able to put it in the book.

00:36:32.910 --> 00:36:36.640
And so in this culture we live
in, one of more, more, more,

00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:38.080
it's risky.

00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:39.150
It's risky.

00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:41.870
Goals and expectations are in
the context of a society that

00:36:41.870 --> 00:36:44.050
always wants more of us.

00:36:44.050 --> 00:36:45.260
Employers want more of us.

00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:46.676
Our relationships
want more of us.

00:36:46.676 --> 00:36:48.290
We want everything
to be perfect.

00:36:48.290 --> 00:36:50.070
My wife tells a
great story where

00:36:50.070 --> 00:36:52.240
she talked to her
great-grandmother

00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:54.650
when she was over
100 years old, just

00:36:54.650 --> 00:36:55.940
maybe a year before she died.

00:36:55.940 --> 00:36:57.930
And she said,
Great-grandma, how am I

00:36:57.930 --> 00:37:03.100
going to find a man who makes
enough money, is really funny,

00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:07.080
is good-looking, has a great
job, is really compassionate,

00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:08.600
and loves me?

00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:11.840
And the woman couldn't
stop laughing.

00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:14.780
She was like, that
doesn't exist.

00:37:14.780 --> 00:37:16.240
You find one or two.

00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:17.890
You look for the rest elsewhere.

00:37:17.890 --> 00:37:21.530
Today in society, we want
everything from everybody

00:37:21.530 --> 00:37:22.680
all the time.

00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:23.920
It's scary.

00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:24.960
It's scary.

00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:27.930
And so the solution I propose
is remembering three words.

00:37:27.930 --> 00:37:31.620
Those words are,
remember the lottery.

00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:33.240
Remember the lottery.

00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:35.270
Remember that we've already won.

00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:36.370
What do I mean by that?

00:37:36.370 --> 00:37:41.180
There are 7 billion
people in the world today.

00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:47.830
There are 115 billion people
who have ever lived, ever.

00:37:47.830 --> 00:37:50.730
That means by being
alive today, you

00:37:50.730 --> 00:37:52.000
have already won the lottery.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:55.330
One in 15 people are alive.

00:37:55.330 --> 00:37:58.020
14 out of every 15
people will never

00:37:58.020 --> 00:37:59.870
eat a bowl of
chocolate ice cream,

00:37:59.870 --> 00:38:02.406
kiss their kids goodnight,
see another sunset,

00:38:02.406 --> 00:38:03.780
or be in the
kitchen with a group

00:38:03.780 --> 00:38:07.590
of friends singing happy
birthday to them ever again.

00:38:07.590 --> 00:38:09.830
You already won the
lottery by being alive.

00:38:09.830 --> 00:38:12.890
And the United Nations
World Happiness Report's

00:38:12.890 --> 00:38:14.300
coming out March 20th.

00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:14.800
Guess what?

00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:16.425
This country's going
to be near the top

00:38:16.425 --> 00:38:17.750
again, as it is every year.

00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:19.166
So we're probably
most people that

00:38:19.166 --> 00:38:21.780
don't have the time or
availability to watch this

00:38:21.780 --> 00:38:23.424
or the people listening in.

00:38:23.424 --> 00:38:24.090
I'm from Canada.

00:38:24.090 --> 00:38:26.870
We're always in the top five,
us and our Scandinavian brothers

00:38:26.870 --> 00:38:28.040
and sisters.

00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:30.140
We already got it good.

00:38:30.140 --> 00:38:32.100
If you have a
post-secondary education,

00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:36.280
you're one of 7% in
the world who does.

00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:38.590
If you make more
than $5,000 a year,

00:38:38.590 --> 00:38:40.100
you're above the world average.

00:38:40.100 --> 00:38:43.970
If you make more than $50,000,
you're in the top 0.05%

00:38:43.970 --> 00:38:44.955
already.

00:38:44.955 --> 00:38:46.290
You know the 1%?

00:38:46.290 --> 00:38:47.590
It's all of us.

00:38:47.590 --> 00:38:51.790
Everyone-- North America,
you won the lottery.

00:38:51.790 --> 00:38:54.570
And if you need even more
motivation than that,

00:38:54.570 --> 00:38:57.410
Google the image "pale
blue dot" and see the Earth

00:38:57.410 --> 00:39:00.760
from a distance, in the vast
expanse of the universe.

00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:05.550
And remember this is the only
place you could ever be alive.

00:39:05.550 --> 00:39:09.250
We got to be here at the perfect
time, in the perfect place,

00:39:09.250 --> 00:39:11.870
with the perfect amount
of oxygen and water,

00:39:11.870 --> 00:39:12.900
and we're alive.

00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:14.860
We have all the
things going for us

00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:17.360
thank you so much for taking
time out of your busy schedules

00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:18.370
to join me today.

00:39:18.370 --> 00:39:18.890
I really appreciate it.

00:39:18.890 --> 00:39:20.265
RACHAEL O'MEARA:
Thank you, Neil.

00:39:20.265 --> 00:39:21.380
Thanks.
