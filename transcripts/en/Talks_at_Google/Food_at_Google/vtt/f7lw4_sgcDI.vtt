DAVID KINCH: Thank you.

00:00:01.912 --> 00:00:09.582
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:09.582 --> 00:00:10.540
DAVID KINCH: Thank you.

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:12.040
I'd be happy to
answer any questions

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.670
I can about myself or,
more excitingly, the book

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:18.700
or the restaurant or
any of the projects

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.840
we're involved in, and
especially about the book.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.380
The book has done
very well so far.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.740
It's been released
for about two weeks.

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.325
It's been a labor of love.

00:00:28.325 --> 00:00:31.570
It's taken about
15 months of work.

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.400
It is a book that
we did, actually,

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.470
much to the
publisher's surprise,

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.390
we did on time and
on budget, which

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.260
they tell me is quite rare
in the publishing industry.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.050
And even though it is a
story of the restaurant,

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.780
people ask what the
cookbook's about.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.520
It's really not a cookbook,
but a story of the restaurant.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.680
We're about 12 years old now.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.190
And I say it's a story
of the restaurant

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.390
as told through narrative
photographs and recipes.

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.991
And when we first decided to do
the book, the first thing I did

00:01:08.991 --> 00:01:10.990
is I went through the
archives of all the dishes

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.355
that we had done for
the past 11 years.

00:01:13.355 --> 00:01:14.230
And there were a lot.

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:16.170
We kept everything in file.

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.660
And I was really excited.

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:21.430
I thought, we'll
document the history

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.740
of the restaurant and our
evolution to the restaurant.

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.520
And I found that looking
through everything,

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.780
that I was not impressed
with-- in fact, embarrassed

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.830
with a lot of the previous
work that we had done.

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.300
And we had agreed to do photo
shoots over a 15-month period

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.760
so we could capture all the
seasonal nuances-- the seasons,

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.750
but also the seasonal
nuances-- throughout the year

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.600
and be able to capture the
full range of ingredients

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.620
that we work with
at the restaurant.

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:54.710
And it ended up turning out that
the dishes that we decided on

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.700
were all the current dishes
that were on the menu,

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:04.330
during the 15
months that we shot,

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.580
to the point where when
I look at the dishes

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.919
that we shot a year
and a half ago,

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:12.650
I see a certain amount
of datedness into it

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.025
and wondering why we were
doing those in the first place.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.890
So about 10% of the recipes
are signature dishes.

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.890
There's recipes that have
kind of come and gone.

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.120
There's certain
dishes that we do

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.030
throughout the year in
season that we really

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.050
like and the restaurant
has become known for.

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.730
So those are
represented in the book.

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.990
But even though it is a story of
the history of the restaurant,

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.240
the actual recipes
and photographs

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:44.890
represent the past 15
months in our evolution.

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.680
There is a reason
for that, I think.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.527
In thinking about
why that happened,

00:02:49.527 --> 00:02:51.110
there's a part of
the book in which we

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:56.120
talk about cuisine
being a dynamic.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:02.400
Food being such an inherent part
of our culture, whether we know

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.710
it or not-- there's the cliche
of food, clothing, and shelter.

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:10.030
How we nourish ourselves,
how we feed ourselves,

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.390
how we energize our
bodies to do what we do

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:18.860
is such an ingrained part in
the human psyche and our culture

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.440
that sometimes, we
take it for granted.

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:22.850
And here in the
United States-- I

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:25.530
consider myself an American
cook, an American chef,

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.360
even though a lot of my
training has been outside

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.800
in much more diverse and
rich culinary cultures.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.690
But it's very nascent.

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.950
It's very young here
in the United States,

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.010
but we are growing, and we are
maturing really, really fast.

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:46.900
Cuisine is a living,
breathing endeavor

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.700
that is extremely dynamic.

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.029
It is constantly changing
and moving forward.

00:03:51.029 --> 00:03:52.570
And that's what
happens with the food

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:55.750
that we do at the restaurant.

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.620
Say we're working with something
like asparagus in springtime.

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.657
There might be dishes
that we really like.

00:04:00.657 --> 00:04:02.740
And then when it comes
around to springtime again,

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:05.070
and great asparagus
becomes available to us,

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:06.150
we have many options.

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.230
We can create the dishes that we
did the year before or the year

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:10.730
before that or the
year before that,

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:12.870
or we can create
completely new dishes

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.492
based upon the cultural--
based upon the reference points

00:04:15.492 --> 00:04:17.200
and the data points
that we have gathered

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.899
throughout the year and the
experiences that we learned.

00:04:19.899 --> 00:04:23.490
Or we can take that exact
dish, and we can build upon it.

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.240
So-called, we can improve it.

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.470
The point is, is
that it's not static.

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.200
It is dynamic.

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.360
And I think any
kind of endeavor,

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.780
especially with food,
what I do for a living,

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:38.220
if we become static-- we
don't evolve, we don't change,

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.260
we don't try to improve
ourselves on a daily basis-- we

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.960
will wither and die,
especially in such

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.280
an intensely competitive
atmosphere as the restaurant

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.530
and hospitality industry
in the Bay Area.

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:56.580
A great example of
cooking, about dynamics

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:02.640
and static or passive,
is, to use an example,

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:08.120
would be what is a static
or passive dessert?

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:13.790
A slice of a tart, a fruit tart,
could be considered passive

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:15.880
because you make the
tart in the afternoon.

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.674
You make it the day before.

00:05:17.674 --> 00:05:19.090
And then when it's
ready to serve,

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:21.952
you cut a slice of the tart,
and you put it on a plate,

00:05:21.952 --> 00:05:22.660
and you serve it.

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:23.370
And it's great.

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:25.030
It's a wonderful dessert.

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:29.800
But it's also the same on
Tuesday as it is Wednesday

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.820
as it is Wednesday at 4
o'clock in the afternoon

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:33.670
to the first piece
you serve at 6:30

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:37.370
and to the piece you
serve at 9:30 at night.

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:41.959
A dynamic dessert, a
real fundamental example

00:05:41.959 --> 00:05:44.250
would be a dessert that is
finished with a scoop of ice

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:47.510
cream, because the ice
cream is on the plate,

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:50.130
and then five minutes
later, it's half melted,

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:51.130
and it has changed.

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:52.610
And it's completely evolved.

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:54.290
It's completely devolved.

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:55.426
That is a dynamic dessert.

00:05:55.426 --> 00:05:56.800
That is a dish
that you're trying

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:01.130
to create that is best to be
enjoyed in the maximum flavor,

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:03.920
and its maximum
effect on the client

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:06.000
is within a specific window.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.700
And this requires a certain
amount of labor and practice

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:13.730
and cooperation amongst
different parts of the kitchen.

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:17.030
And that's one reason
why dynamic desserts

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:17.880
are more expensive.

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:19.680
It's not necessarily because
of ingredients or anything

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:20.180
like that.

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:22.150
But you're paying
for the labor for it.

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:24.330
So that is a good example.

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:32.150
One last thing I want to mention
before we can go to questions

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:39.360
is-- maturation of a
chef, modernist cuisine,

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:42.270
the power of media
in my industry.

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:45.220
It used to be when I started
out as a young line cook,

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:47.320
nobody knew the
name of the chef.

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:49.090
We were domestics.

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:50.594
We worked behind the scenes.

00:06:50.594 --> 00:06:53.010
If anybody knew anybody's name
in the restaurant business,

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:55.500
it was the owner of the
restaurant or the maitre d'.

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:57.920
And it's changed
dramatically over the years.

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:01.610
Over the past couple of decades,
chefs have become famous.

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:04.960
They've become much more
celebrity-conscious.

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:07.530
And I don't necessarily
think that is a good thing.

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:13.310
It has lured people into the
industry for the wrong reasons.

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:19.420
It used to be
cooking was a craft.

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:22.020
It was a middle-class craft.

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:25.400
It would be almost like
blacksmithing or learning

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:29.610
how to weave or working with
tapestries, in which you learn

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:33.020
certain skills, minutiae,
attention to detail,

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:37.840
and you did them over and over
and over again until you could

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:40.350
just pick up an onion, and
without thinking about it,

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:42.410
without looking at
it, you'd peel it,

00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:44.330
and you'd cut into
quarter inch dice,

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:46.070
and your cutting
board would be clean,

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:47.630
and you have a pile
of waste, and you

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:48.800
have the pile of onions.

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:50.540
There was no thought
process behind it.

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:52.180
You just did things.

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:57.320
And you spent years perfecting
these rote, small minutiae,

00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:00.210
details, and then you
advanced up through a kitchen.

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:01.482
And it was a craft.

00:08:01.482 --> 00:08:02.690
Were there artistic elements?

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:04.360
Yes, there was always
artistic elements.

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:07.090
But there was never
really artists.

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:09.810
Artists come along
only once a generation.

00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:12.000
Not everybody's an artist.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.600
So it was always a craft
with artistic sensibilities.

00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:19.160
Nowadays, I think
a lot of people

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:20.910
are attracted to the
industry because they

00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:22.770
feel that it's
incredibly glamorous.

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:25.450
I can tell you,
I'm 52 years old,

00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:28.070
and I still work 'til
1:30 AM in the morning,

00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:31.650
and there's nothing
glamorous about that.

00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:33.110
I work weekends.

00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:34.320
I work nights.

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:35.270
I work holidays.

00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:37.390
I work when you all
have time to go out

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:39.549
and eat at nice restaurants.

00:08:39.549 --> 00:08:40.960
That's what we do.

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:51.240
So the final maturation
in a chef is not

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:53.380
when things are brand
new and you see things

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:56.050
that you've never seen
before, or you're bedazzled,

00:08:56.050 --> 00:08:59.210
or the media tells you a dish
or new restaurant is great.

00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:02.980
The last thing that happens
in a chef's development, when

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:04.620
they are mature, when
they're confident

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:06.180
in their own
abilities, when they're

00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:08.492
confident in their
style, is that they're

00:09:08.492 --> 00:09:10.200
cooking the most simple
food they've ever

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:13.870
cooked in their entire
life because they

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:15.690
are confident in
their technique,

00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:17.990
in their perfection
of their technique.

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:21.000
They're buying the best
possible ingredients, which

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.420
they can buy because any chef
worth their salt will tell you,

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:26.490
the single most important
thing in cooking

00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:29.460
is always buying the best
possible quality product

00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:33.260
that you can afford, which
usually means catching things

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.760
at the peak of their season,
because they're at their best

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:39.420
and at their cheapest,
a win-win situation,

00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:41.680
and then gently
nudging them forward

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:44.900
to where they are showing
at their very best.

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:50.600
Any flim-flammery,
wizardry, gimmickry

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:53.660
that covers up the inherent
beautiful qualities

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:57.920
that nature gives us is
usually the last thing

00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:00.090
jettisoned by an immature cook.

00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:03.440
A lot of molecular gastronomy
and gimmickry you will find

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:06.490
is mostly chefs who are
trying to impress other chefs

00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:09.950
and not necessarily offering
the best possible experience

00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:12.920
to you, the paying clients.

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:18.220
So that's really all I have to
tell people at Google today.

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:20.710
I'd be happy to answer
any questions that you

00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:22.510
might have about the book or--

00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:24.150
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:28.100
DAVID KINCH: He's asking why I
felt that now is the best time.

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:29.760
It wasn't completely
my decision.

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:34.450
I had been wanting to write a
cookbook for the longest time.

00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:36.430
I had written several
proposals over the years,

00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:40.480
even with the same publisher
who eventually accepted us.

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:45.300
And I was always rejected
for whatever reasons.

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:48.450
And then the third
time, it was accepted.

00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:50.310
And in conversations
with them, he

00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:53.850
told me that, well, now the
restaurant had a story to tell,

00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:55.455
now that I had a story to tell.

00:10:55.455 --> 00:10:57.080
And it was interesting
because I really

00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:59.481
fought to put the
proposals together.

00:10:59.481 --> 00:11:00.730
Everything was kind of forced.

00:11:00.730 --> 00:11:03.692
And it was, you know,
OK, I have a restaurant,

00:11:03.692 --> 00:11:05.900
and people are starting to
hear about the restaurant,

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:07.680
so my next step is
to write a cookbook.

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:09.510
I have to do this.

00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:12.010
And then I just kind
of forgot about it.

00:11:12.010 --> 00:11:15.470
And then when the final
proposal was accepted,

00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:17.170
it kind of happened
really naturally

00:11:17.170 --> 00:11:18.130
and really organically.

00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:20.280
And a lot of the comments
that we receive about the book

00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:22.050
is that there is a
naturalness to the book that's

00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:24.784
reflective of the restaurant and
what we do at the restaurant,

00:11:24.784 --> 00:11:25.700
that it wasn't forced.

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:27.658
It wasn't like it was
time to write a cookbook.

00:11:27.658 --> 00:11:29.921
It was a cookbook that is
naturally telling our story.

00:11:29.921 --> 00:11:31.420
So I think it was
more of a feeling,

00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:32.590
just things fell into place.

00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:34.542
I found the right photographer.

00:11:34.542 --> 00:11:37.000
The writer who I really wanted
to work with all of a sudden

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.640
became available and wanted
to be involved in the project.

00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:41.515
And of course, it was
accepted by a publisher

00:11:41.515 --> 00:11:43.056
whom I have great respect for.

00:11:43.056 --> 00:11:45.825
Do I have a favorite
season in mind?

00:11:45.825 --> 00:11:47.450
If I had to pick one,
it would probably

00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:49.440
be right now, the
fall, because we

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:52.142
have the best of-- the
bounty of summertime,

00:11:52.142 --> 00:11:54.600
but we're starting to move into
a little bit-- we can start

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:56.050
cooking with red meats again.

00:11:56.050 --> 00:12:00.140
Red wine comes into play, cooler
nights, that sort of thing.

00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:01.910
But the great
thing about cooking

00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:05.342
seasonally is you cook
with all the bounty

00:12:05.342 --> 00:12:06.300
of a particular season.

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:08.770
And right when you're getting
really bored or tired of it,

00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:11.120
you're moving out
of it, and you're

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:13.220
moving to new and
more exciting things.

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:15.678
And then for nine months, you
don't have to worry about it.

00:12:15.678 --> 00:12:18.650
And when things come around into
the cycle, you're re-energized.

00:12:18.650 --> 00:12:20.441
You're re-energized
and think about things.

00:12:22.439 --> 00:12:23.980
I like cooking all
times of the year.

00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:26.730
Believe it or not, my least
favorite time is summertime.

00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:29.580
Everything's so
leafy and tomatoey.

00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:31.450
It's frivolous, which is nice.

00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:31.950
It's nice.

00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:32.960
It's nice for three months.

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:34.001
But it's not my favorite.

00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:39.410
Every year we do
a tomato dinner,

00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:42.880
where every course
has tomatoes in it.

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:49.710
And actually, it's a celebration
to celebrate the relationship

00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:52.570
I have with Love Apple Farms,
which is the farm that we work

00:12:52.570 --> 00:12:54.320
with who supplies
much of the produce

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:55.730
to the restaurant year round.

00:12:55.730 --> 00:12:58.060
And she was originally a
champion tomato grower.

00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:00.760
I first originally
bought tomatoes from her,

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:02.730
before we expanded
the relationship.

00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:06.460
And tomatoes are still a very
big part of what she does

00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:07.830
and how she does it.

00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:09.490
So every year, we do it.

00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:11.330
And we try to change
the dishes up.

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:13.350
So it's getting harder
and harder right now

00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:15.300
to try and not repeat dishes.

00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:17.477
We're trying to create
our tomato desserts.

00:13:17.477 --> 00:13:19.060
We're like on our
10th tomato dessert.

00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:21.673
It's really hard at this point.

00:13:21.673 --> 00:13:23.150
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:26.100
DAVID KINCH: She's
asking what dishes

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:29.320
I've seen evolve over
the years and how

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:32.432
I've seen the involvement
over the years, pretty much.

00:13:32.432 --> 00:13:34.890
There's a dish that we do called
Into the Vegetable Garden,

00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:36.306
which is on the
menu all the time.

00:13:39.185 --> 00:13:40.810
It's on the menu all
the time, and it's

00:13:40.810 --> 00:13:42.510
the only dish that's on
the menu all the time,

00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:44.218
with the exact same
wording all the time,

00:13:44.218 --> 00:13:45.820
but the dish is
different every day.

00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:47.230
I know that sounds strange.

00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:51.590
But what it is, the rule
is that everything that

00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:54.040
comes from Love Apple
Farms on a daily basis,

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:57.207
there has to be an item
of that on this plate.

00:13:57.207 --> 00:13:58.790
And if it's not from
Love Apple Farms,

00:13:58.790 --> 00:14:00.040
it can't be on this plate.

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:03.860
It's a celebration of this
relationship that we have.

00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:06.660
One cynically could say it
looks like a green salad.

00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:11.660
But in the handful of bites,
the four to five bites that

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:13.230
are on the plate,
there's anywhere

00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:17.890
from 45 to 60 ingredients
on the plate every day.

00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:19.640
And it's built up in
the shape of a plant.

00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:21.810
There's root vegetable
purees on the bottom,

00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:22.860
and there's a cooked set.

00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:27.021
Then there's a raw set,
a seed set, a flower set.

00:14:27.021 --> 00:14:28.520
If you look at it
from 10 feet away,

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:29.686
it looks like a green salad.

00:14:29.686 --> 00:14:31.259
But each leaf is on there.

00:14:31.259 --> 00:14:33.050
There's up to 30 leaves
on it, and each one

00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:35.560
is from a different plant
or a different vegetable

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:38.030
or a different lettuce or herb.

00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:40.500
So each mouthful is different.

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:43.750
And we get deliveries from
the farm three times a week.

00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:46.900
And we have two people who
just work on this dish.

00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:48.100
That's all they do.

00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:51.170
For the 50 people we feed
a night, everybody gets it,

00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:53.010
and each one's built to order.

00:14:53.010 --> 00:14:56.660
So they spend a lot of
time cleaning and building

00:14:56.660 --> 00:15:00.030
these little kits
that come together.

00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:01.840
But it never started
out just like this.

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:04.630
It originally
started out, we were

00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:06.750
looking for a dish
that represented

00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:09.280
the relationship
between the farm.

00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:11.521
But when it started out,
it was a lot smaller.

00:15:11.521 --> 00:15:12.770
It was only about three acres.

00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:15.560
The farm's now 22 acres.

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:18.020
When it started out, there was
a limited amount of produce.

00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:20.370
So we were kind of
just doing vegetables.

00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:22.090
They had a great
patch of potatoes,

00:15:22.090 --> 00:15:24.750
so it started out
as a potato dish

00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:27.242
with burrata cheese and
vegetables from the farm.

00:15:27.242 --> 00:15:28.950
And then we got rid
of the burrata cheese

00:15:28.950 --> 00:15:30.283
because we weren't producing it.

00:15:30.283 --> 00:15:32.650
And then we weren't getting
the potatoes year round.

00:15:32.650 --> 00:15:34.500
So we were calling
it-- it started out

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:37.776
potatoes and burrata with the
vegetables from the garden.

00:15:37.776 --> 00:15:39.650
And then it was just
potatoes with vegetables

00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:40.540
from the garden.

00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:42.770
And finally, we just
took this plunge

00:15:42.770 --> 00:15:44.380
in which we went in
and just called it

00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:45.950
Into the Vegetable Garden.

00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:47.780
And it became much
more of a concept.

00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:50.470
There's even an edible
dirt on the plate we make,

00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:54.830
which is made with dehydrated
potatoes and parsnips

00:15:54.830 --> 00:15:58.440
and almonds and
roasted chicory root,

00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:01.170
which makes it look
like potting soil.

00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:02.950
But it's very
delicious potting soil,

00:16:02.950 --> 00:16:05.330
and it's sprinkled around
there to represent dirt.

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:08.410
AUDIENCE: Have a favorite dish?

00:16:08.410 --> 00:16:10.627
DAVID KINCH: No, I don't
have a favorite dish.

00:16:10.627 --> 00:16:11.710
Do I have a favorite dish?

00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:12.320
No, I don't.

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:22.110
I mean, I orchestrate
everything.

00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:23.900
I got a team of 14
people in the kitchen

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:26.287
for feeding 55 people a night.

00:16:26.287 --> 00:16:27.120
They work very hard.

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:28.830
They work 12-hour days.

00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:31.199
And I throw a lot of
curveballs at them.

00:16:31.199 --> 00:16:32.740
It's like, they'll
come up to a dish.

00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:34.220
They'll get into a routine.

00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:36.230
And once we're into a routine,
and everything is going really

00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:37.770
well with the menu,
that's usually

00:16:37.770 --> 00:16:42.110
when I want to change things
and try new ideas and things.

00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:44.480
And we do only tasting menus.

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:47.400
We do a six-course menu
and a 14-course menu.

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:51.130
So for me, it's not necessarily
dishes, but it's the meal.

00:16:51.130 --> 00:16:53.770
And we look at different
points in the meal.

00:16:53.770 --> 00:16:55.830
It's like you have chapters.

00:16:55.830 --> 00:16:59.780
You have like an introduction
of flavors, and things rise up.

00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:02.990
The garden is kind of like the
climax, the garden dish, which

00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:04.270
is right smack in the middle.

00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:05.630
And then there's a denouement.

00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:07.579
We finish with a
piece of red meat,

00:17:07.579 --> 00:17:11.550
but it's not the biggest portion
that you're going to get.

00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:13.050
It's actually going
to be the garden

00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:14.341
dish in the middle of the meal.

00:17:14.341 --> 00:17:15.660
So it kind of slowly descends.

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:16.339
And we then we have desserts.

00:17:16.339 --> 00:17:18.213
And we kind of want to
finish like a whisper,

00:17:18.213 --> 00:17:20.349
or like really, really
quiet at the end.

00:17:20.349 --> 00:17:24.160
And we start with
a dish and finish

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:27.412
with a dish that
looks exactly alike,

00:17:27.412 --> 00:17:29.120
but the flavors are
completely different.

00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:31.411
The first ones are savory,
and the last ones are sweet.

00:17:31.411 --> 00:17:32.835
You can see it in the book.

00:17:32.835 --> 00:17:34.960
And it kind of denotes the
full circle of the meal.

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:37.380
So I'm not looking
at specific dishes,

00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:40.670
but I'm looking at
an arc of the meal

00:17:40.670 --> 00:17:45.310
and how I can tweak the
experience along that arc.

00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:47.660
I think if you're
doing a meal that

00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:50.630
involves 10, 12, 14
courses, each dish

00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:52.180
can't be really,
really complicated

00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:54.240
because then you can't
process everything.

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:58.352
Everything needs to be simple
because it all adds up.

00:17:58.352 --> 00:18:00.810
And ultimately, if you're eating
an appetizer, main course,

00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:02.710
and a dessert at a
restaurant, or you're

00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:04.910
eating a 15-course
tasting menu, one

00:18:04.910 --> 00:18:06.522
is not bigger than the other.

00:18:06.522 --> 00:18:07.980
I still think a
meal should consist

00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:10.244
of 25 small bites of food.

00:18:10.244 --> 00:18:11.910
You can do it with
three plates of food,

00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:15.250
or you can do it with
15 plates of food.

00:18:15.250 --> 00:18:18.610
What you're paying for or
what you're looking for

00:18:18.610 --> 00:18:22.074
is really a diversity or a
variety of tastes and textures

00:18:22.074 --> 00:18:22.740
and experiences.

00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:24.073
A lot of people don't want that.

00:18:24.073 --> 00:18:25.620
A lot of people want
a plate of food.

00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:27.625
They can have six or
seven-- a dish evolves.

00:18:27.625 --> 00:18:28.910
You have that first bite.

00:18:28.910 --> 00:18:30.370
It's explosive, it's different.

00:18:30.370 --> 00:18:32.290
And you enjoy it more,
and you enjoy it more,

00:18:32.290 --> 00:18:34.682
and things mix together,
that sort of thing.

00:18:34.682 --> 00:18:35.890
I understand that experience.

00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:37.150
That's a great experience.

00:18:37.150 --> 00:18:38.815
But then there's a
tasting menu, where

00:18:38.815 --> 00:18:40.037
you have two or three dishes.

00:18:40.037 --> 00:18:41.620
Maybe there's a
little bit of a palate

00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:42.852
fatigue after the third bite.

00:18:42.852 --> 00:18:43.810
But then you know what?

00:18:43.810 --> 00:18:44.500
It's finished.

00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:47.816
It's whisked away, and you
have another small sample

00:18:47.816 --> 00:18:49.440
that's probably a
little bit different.

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:52.070
Hot dish following a cold
dish, something crispy followed

00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:55.920
by something soft,
something vegetal

00:18:55.920 --> 00:19:01.610
followed by something that has
real oceanic or saline flavors.

00:19:01.610 --> 00:19:03.620
That's kind of how we
look at in the kitchen,

00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:05.525
as opposed to individual dishes.

00:19:05.525 --> 00:19:07.850
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:12.810
DAVID KINCH: He's asking how
increased dietary restrictions

00:19:12.810 --> 00:19:15.580
and/or aversions affect
what we do at the restaurant

00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:16.792
and how we deal with it.

00:19:16.792 --> 00:19:19.000
Funny story, I was cooking
in France at a restaurant.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.470
A great friend of mine has a
great restaurant in France.

00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:23.330
I was cooking over there, and
we were doing a special dinner,

00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:24.171
and we were cooking.

00:19:24.171 --> 00:19:26.670
And an order came back, and it
had some dietary restrictions

00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:27.170
on it.

00:19:27.170 --> 00:19:29.780
And he turns around and says
to his staff, four Americans

00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:36.390
on table 22, because
you'd be amazed

00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:39.090
at how much of an American
phenomenon this is.

00:19:39.090 --> 00:19:42.220
America has more dietary
restrictions and allergies

00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:45.210
than any country on the planet.

00:19:45.210 --> 00:19:47.190
Or at least they express
them in a restaurant.

00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:48.690
It is extraordinary.

00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:54.290
I was saying at lunch today,
35% to 40% of my diners

00:19:54.290 --> 00:19:58.080
every night make some
sort of change in the menu

00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:02.860
that we're preparing for them
to suit their personal needs.

00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:06.440
35% to 40%.

00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:09.960
I would say that 80% of
them are not allergies.

00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:12.680
They are people who
don't like red peppers,

00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:14.440
or they don't want
me to do mushrooms

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:17.540
for them, because they
don't like mushrooms.

00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:19.550
And that's fine.

00:20:19.550 --> 00:20:20.710
We do what we can.

00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:21.930
We don't say no to anybody.

00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:23.830
We do everything
within our power.

00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:27.600
But my feeling is,
is my restaurant,

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:30.520
at this point, my
price point, in what

00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:33.390
we do-- we've worked
very, very hard to craft

00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:36.400
a really great,
sensual experience,

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:37.440
a hedonist experience.

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:39.700
We want you to come
in for three hours,

00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:43.140
turn off your cell phone, forget
about your frantic lifestyle.

00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:45.050
You have a chance to escape.

00:20:45.050 --> 00:20:47.750
That's what you're paying
for when you come to Manresa.

00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:51.110
We hope you like the food,
but the service, the ambiance,

00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:54.390
everything we do is to make
you forget everything and just

00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:55.360
really enjoy yourself.

00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:58.052
And we're an oasis.

00:20:58.052 --> 00:21:00.010
We're an oasis in the
middle of Silicon Valley,

00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:01.900
and that's what
you're paying for.

00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:07.120
And I like to think
that people come here,

00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:10.100
and they kind of put
themselves into our hands

00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:16.200
and have them allow us
to do everything possible

00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:18.895
we can to crack that experience
because that's what we do.

00:21:18.895 --> 00:21:21.100
It's what we do for a living.

00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:23.380
But sadly, that's not the case.

00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:27.210
And I understand people who
have severe nut allergies

00:21:27.210 --> 00:21:29.510
or can't eat peanuts.

00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:31.445
But I'll tell you,
I have people who

00:21:31.445 --> 00:21:34.491
come in and say they won't
eat food that had a mother.

00:21:34.491 --> 00:21:35.990
I have people who
say they won't eat

00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:38.154
food that has the
color green in it.

00:21:38.154 --> 00:21:38.820
And I'm serious.

00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:41.870
They want to do tasting menus.

00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:43.110
They want to.

00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:46.790
And we have to create 15 to
18 different plates of food

00:21:46.790 --> 00:21:48.130
on the fly.

00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:52.320
We have to make it up at
the beginning of the meal.

00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:56.780
And we do our
best, but we're not

00:21:56.780 --> 00:21:58.590
giving them the best
experience we can get.

00:21:58.590 --> 00:22:01.659
The worst is the people
who don't-- people call,

00:22:01.659 --> 00:22:02.450
make a reservation.

00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:06.400
We call to confirm.

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:08.950
We always ask, do you
have any allergies?

00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:10.620
Do you have any restrictions?

00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:12.828
They're the ones who don't
say anything and then come

00:22:12.828 --> 00:22:14.590
in and say they're vegan.

00:22:14.590 --> 00:22:17.830
Vegans with nut
allergies, oh my god.

00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:19.570
Oh my god.

00:22:19.570 --> 00:22:22.800
Tasting menus, tasting menus.

00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:26.590
And I'm not trying to denigrate.

00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:27.460
I understand.

00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:29.027
We're a business.

00:22:29.027 --> 00:22:31.360
We want people to come in,
and we want them to be happy.

00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:34.530
But it doesn't allow us to craft
the best experience we possibly

00:22:34.530 --> 00:22:35.390
can.

00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:37.950
Now another thing we were
talking about at lunch today

00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:40.360
is we're going to only
one menu in January.

00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:42.190
We're making a big
step, and we're

00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:44.060
going to offer only
one experience.

00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:45.800
We're going to
offer the best menu

00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:48.700
that we can put out every night.

00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:50.220
But if someone
wants three courses,

00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:51.490
we're going to say fine.

00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:53.031
We're not going to
say no to anybody.

00:22:53.031 --> 00:22:54.980
If someone wants seven
courses, you know,

00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:56.280
I've got to be out two hours.

00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:57.620
I want to go to a show
at the Mountain Winery--

00:22:57.620 --> 00:22:58.580
I need to be out.

00:22:58.580 --> 00:23:00.060
I just want to do five courses.

00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:02.880
I got a guy who comes to my
restaurant five times a month,

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:04.940
and he only does three courses.

00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:06.292
And he buys a lot of wine.

00:23:06.292 --> 00:23:08.000
I'm not going to all
the sudden tell him,

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.916
you know what, you can't
come to my restaurant

00:23:09.916 --> 00:23:14.280
anymore because this-- we're
going to say no to nobody.

00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:16.960
That said, for us to
craft the experience,

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:19.179
we have to know every
single bit of information

00:23:19.179 --> 00:23:20.470
about the customers that we do.

00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:23.075
We feed 300 people a week.

00:23:23.075 --> 00:23:24.480
We feed 300 people a week.

00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:26.680
We feed 50 people a night.

00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:29.447
We have the opportunity to
know every single person who

00:23:29.447 --> 00:23:30.530
comes into the restaurant.

00:23:30.530 --> 00:23:31.740
You're not table 22.

00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:33.060
You're not table 11.

00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:35.470
You're not position two.

00:23:35.470 --> 00:23:38.450
You are the so
and so who's here,

00:23:38.450 --> 00:23:41.550
and she likes to start with
a Corpse Reviver Number 2.

00:23:41.550 --> 00:23:44.900
He doesn't like
mushrooms, and he always

00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:49.080
buys red Burgundy, between
$350 and $475 a bottle.

00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:51.280
We have all that information.

00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:53.450
We gather as much of that
information as we can.

00:23:53.450 --> 00:23:55.220
So when people call
for reservations,

00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:58.110
what we're going to do is we're
going actually have, believe it

00:23:58.110 --> 00:24:00.270
or not, a reservation concierge.

00:24:00.270 --> 00:24:04.280
I have to hire someone
full-time at the restaurant

00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:06.300
to call people, and
we're going to have

00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:08.840
to get all their dietary
restrictions five

00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:10.620
days in advance.

00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:12.791
We're going to have to do it.

00:24:12.791 --> 00:24:14.790
And even though we're
going to do only one menu,

00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:16.040
we're going to have
five menus a night.

00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:18.300
We're actually going to
go from two to five menus,

00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:20.800
because we're going to have to
create the menu that we think

00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:23.460
offers the best
Manresa experience.

00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:25.590
We're going to have
to do the gluten free.

00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:27.800
We're going to have
to do the vegetarian.

00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:30.070
We're going to have to
do the no shellfish.

00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:34.200
We're going to have to do the
no red meat, except for squab.

00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:36.876
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:36.876 --> 00:24:44.510
DAVID KINCH: You know,
it's-- and organize this.

00:24:44.510 --> 00:24:48.380
And what we would
like to do is know

00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:49.771
what every table
is going to eat.

00:24:49.771 --> 00:24:51.270
Every single person
is going to eat,

00:24:51.270 --> 00:24:53.500
we want to know at 3
o'clock in the afternoon.

00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:55.090
There's no ticket going
to come into the kitchen.

00:24:55.090 --> 00:24:57.210
We have the ticket at 3
o'clock in the afternoon.

00:24:57.210 --> 00:24:59.080
And you know what,
I think then we

00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:01.460
will be able to offer
a great experience.

00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:03.510
Talking with other
chefs who do this,

00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:06.270
they say they got tired of it.

00:25:06.270 --> 00:25:09.250
And it's not because they're
tired of people dictating what

00:25:09.250 --> 00:25:10.840
and how they want
to eat, but they

00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:13.880
got tired of the
frustration, not

00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:17.620
being able to offer their best
experience to the customer.

00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:20.100
So he says, I charge
a lot of money,

00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:21.820
and I've got to do
this on the fly,

00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:22.990
and I don't want to
do this on the fly.

00:25:22.990 --> 00:25:24.230
They're still paying
the same money,

00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:26.271
and I still want them to
have a great experience.

00:25:26.271 --> 00:25:28.230
I want them to come back.

00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:31.060
But I can't do it when they
just come in and tell me.

00:25:31.060 --> 00:25:32.940
I need to know in advance.

00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:35.140
So I think that's really
the only thing we can do.

00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:37.352
"Combat it" is the wrong word.

00:25:37.352 --> 00:25:41.900
But it's pretty
intense right now.

00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:46.280
We have nights where 70% of
the people change their menu.

00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:47.355
Like last night.

00:25:47.355 --> 00:25:48.864
Last night was like that.

00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:56.935
All but four tables last
night had dietary restrictions

00:25:56.935 --> 00:25:58.892
that required menu changes.

00:25:58.892 --> 00:26:00.284
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:26:00.284 --> 00:26:00.950
DAVID KINCH: OK.

00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:02.540
That's an easy question.

00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:04.570
There's absolutely none.

00:26:04.570 --> 00:26:06.195
But there's a reason why.

00:26:06.195 --> 00:26:07.820
Because our first
restaurant was called

00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:09.880
Sent Sovi, which
was in Saratoga.

00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:11.160
It's still there.

00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:12.701
We had a restaurant
called Sent Sovi,

00:26:12.701 --> 00:26:15.380
and Manresa was a relocation
of that restaurant.

00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:17.520
And Sent Sovi, when it
originally opened up,

00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:20.520
was a Catalan style bistro.

00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:25.037
And Sent Sovi was
named after a cookbook.

00:26:25.037 --> 00:26:26.620
It was called the
Llibre de Sent Sovi.

00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:34.120
And before the discovery
of the New World,

00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:36.280
it was the most
influential cooking manual

00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:39.130
in all of Europe.

00:26:39.130 --> 00:26:44.880
It codified the most famous
recipes in all of Europe.

00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:46.596
They drew diagrams
of all the fish

00:26:46.596 --> 00:26:49.220
from the Mediterranean and North
Atlantic that were known there

00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:51.920
and wrote the flavor
characteristics

00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:53.110
and how to break them down.

00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:55.360
It was this all-inclusive work.

00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:57.030
And it was believed
to have been written

00:26:57.030 --> 00:27:00.810
by a bunch of Catalan cooks
who cooked in the English royal

00:27:00.810 --> 00:27:02.330
court.

00:27:02.330 --> 00:27:06.284
And so we named the
restaurant after this book.

00:27:06.284 --> 00:27:07.950
And when we decided
to move to Manresa--

00:27:07.950 --> 00:27:10.420
and we slowly morphed away
from this Catalan influence.

00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:13.420
We became more and more enamored
with the local ingredients

00:27:13.420 --> 00:27:15.060
here in California.

00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:20.180
And that's really where we
started to do our focus on.

00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:22.980
And when we decided
to relocate, we

00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:24.880
found the space
that's now Manresa.

00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:30.540
We called it Manresa
as a working title.

00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:33.900
Manresa is the name of
the town next to Barcelona

00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:36.750
in the Catalan country, the
capital the Catalan country,

00:27:36.750 --> 00:27:41.070
where the order of Jesuits
or Junipero Serra was from,

00:27:41.070 --> 00:27:44.370
who founded all the--
not Spanish missions,

00:27:44.370 --> 00:27:46.930
but the Catalan missions
along the coast of California,

00:27:46.930 --> 00:27:48.410
named half the
coast of California.

00:27:48.410 --> 00:27:50.650
Junipero Serra, when everything
was actually Catalan,

00:27:50.650 --> 00:27:51.772
not Spanish.

00:27:51.772 --> 00:27:53.980
So when it actually came
time to name the restaurant,

00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:55.060
we couldn't think of anything.

00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:56.110
It was actually the
hardest thing to do.

00:27:56.110 --> 00:27:57.460
So we kept Manresa.

00:27:57.460 --> 00:28:00.030
But the short answer is, it's
a beach south of Santa Cruz,

00:28:00.030 --> 00:28:01.279
really close to where we live.

00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:05.253
You got the long and
the short answer.

00:28:05.253 --> 00:28:07.420
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:12.610
DAVID KINCH: Yes,
I mean I admire

00:28:12.610 --> 00:28:14.460
all great ambitious chefs.

00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:21.470
I learn-- right now,
the most inspiring thing

00:28:21.470 --> 00:28:23.990
is traveling and meeting
like-minded chefs

00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:27.180
and learning what they do and
eating in their restaurants

00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:29.320
and learning what
their viewpoints are.

00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:33.885
That's a really big part
of what we do is sharing.

00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:39.010
We started bringing
in guest chefs

00:28:39.010 --> 00:28:42.210
from all over the world
at Manresa, back in 2007.

00:28:42.210 --> 00:28:44.610
Some really great two and
three-star Michelin chefs

00:28:44.610 --> 00:28:48.590
from all over, from
Denmark and France

00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:55.150
and Spain have
come over to cook.

00:28:55.150 --> 00:28:56.920
And it's always been
an exchange of ideas.

00:28:56.920 --> 00:28:59.675
And the great thing is, is I
get to go to their restaurant

00:28:59.675 --> 00:29:03.250
and cook, too, because
it's always an exchange.

00:29:03.250 --> 00:29:06.860
So we like to do that a lot.

00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:08.430
Most of my inspiration
nowadays comes

00:29:08.430 --> 00:29:10.700
from travel, reading and travel.

00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:18.085
Actually, we have a
really great-- May 17

00:29:18.085 --> 00:29:20.210
and 18 of next year, we
have this great [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:20.210 --> 00:29:23.115
chef, a really young guy, just
got his third Michelin star.

00:29:23.115 --> 00:29:26.600
His name's [INAUDIBLE],
and he cooks

00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:31.130
in the middle of
the Basque country.

00:29:31.130 --> 00:29:32.130
He has a big garden.

00:29:32.130 --> 00:29:33.880
His restaurant's
surrounded by the garden.

00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:35.480
He cooks completely
from his garden.

00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:37.894
And he's coming to cook
with us May 17 and 18

00:29:37.894 --> 00:29:40.310
of next year, which is going
to be a really amazing event,

00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:41.780
and he's cooking for two days.

00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:43.071
So I'm pretty excited about it.

00:29:43.071 --> 00:29:45.250
That's a great example of
what you're talking about.

00:29:45.250 --> 00:29:46.190
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:29:46.190 --> 00:29:49.500
DAVID KINCH: What do I do
for the creative process?

00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:53.220
Well, I have to be honest.

00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:55.500
It's mostly ingredients.

00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:56.539
We'll get one thing.

00:29:56.539 --> 00:29:58.080
We'll have access
to one thing that's

00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:00.475
really special and
really perfect.

00:30:00.475 --> 00:30:01.475
It could be an eggplant.

00:30:01.475 --> 00:30:03.724
It could be a piece of fish,
could be a piece of meat.

00:30:03.724 --> 00:30:07.650
It could be a piece of
fruit from a great purveyor,

00:30:07.650 --> 00:30:10.420
and we know we only have two
or three weeks to work with it.

00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:13.770
And what we do is we try
and create everything

00:30:13.770 --> 00:30:16.950
around the fundamental flavor
and the characteristics

00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:19.590
of that one, and everything
else is kind of like a satellite

00:30:19.590 --> 00:30:20.090
off that.

00:30:20.090 --> 00:30:22.410
I talk a little bit
about that in the book.

00:30:22.410 --> 00:30:24.810
We try to have like three
elements on a plate.

00:30:24.810 --> 00:30:27.650
We have a main element and
then a secondary element

00:30:27.650 --> 00:30:31.990
that offers a certain sense
of comfort or knowledge

00:30:31.990 --> 00:30:32.850
to everyone.

00:30:32.850 --> 00:30:36.020
It could be like meat and
potatoes or tomato and basil,

00:30:36.020 --> 00:30:38.300
something like that,
something that there

00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:41.467
is an obvious connection.

00:30:41.467 --> 00:30:43.300
It doesn't have to be
an obvious connection,

00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:45.299
but it seems like an
obvious connection.

00:30:45.299 --> 00:30:46.840
And then the third
element is usually

00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:48.560
something jarring
or contrasting.

00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:51.916
It could be a
temperature contrast.

00:30:51.916 --> 00:30:53.790
When it comes down to
having a finished dish,

00:30:53.790 --> 00:30:55.248
and we're doing
the editing process

00:30:55.248 --> 00:30:59.050
before it goes on the
menu, our process is not,

00:30:59.050 --> 00:31:01.510
what else can we add to
this to finish this plate?

00:31:01.510 --> 00:31:04.210
It's, what can we take off?

00:31:04.210 --> 00:31:06.330
You're stripping
things of the plate

00:31:06.330 --> 00:31:09.430
until it's still complete, but
there's nothing else on there.

00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:11.807
we try to leave things as bare
and as simple as possible.

00:31:11.807 --> 00:31:13.890
That's going back to the
tasting menu format, too.

00:31:13.890 --> 00:31:17.830
We don't want it to be
15 complicated dishes.

00:31:17.830 --> 00:31:20.020
It needs to be 15 simple dishes.

00:31:20.020 --> 00:31:21.599
Oh, how was your
meal at Manresa?

00:31:21.599 --> 00:31:22.140
It was great.

00:31:22.140 --> 00:31:23.202
But what'd you eat?

00:31:23.202 --> 00:31:27.120
I don't really remember,
because it was just

00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:30.502
this barrage of
complicated dishes.

00:31:30.502 --> 00:31:35.000
You want things to be
simple and to stand out.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:38.420
And the second question
was cookbook about--

00:31:38.420 --> 00:31:41.120
AUDIENCE: How do
you hope users will

00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:43.310
approach the
cookbook [INAUDIBLE]?

00:31:43.310 --> 00:31:46.180
DAVID KINCH: How do I hope
people will use the cookbook?

00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:50.050
A couple things about the
cookbook, none of the recipes

00:31:50.050 --> 00:31:50.902
are dumbed down.

00:31:50.902 --> 00:31:53.110
Everything is exactly how
we do it at the restaurant.

00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:54.890
There are no shortcuts.

00:31:54.890 --> 00:31:58.450
That said, there are tons of
really simple recipes in there,

00:31:58.450 --> 00:31:59.710
believe it or not.

00:31:59.710 --> 00:32:03.059
Tons of simple recipes, and
then recipes of more ambition.

00:32:03.059 --> 00:32:04.600
And what I would
hope people would do

00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:06.780
is they try some of the simple
recipes, or recipes they feel

00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:08.630
is in their skill
set or skill level.

00:32:08.630 --> 00:32:12.090
And I think even the most basic
cooks, there's several things.

00:32:12.090 --> 00:32:15.810
And then if it
works out, then you

00:32:15.810 --> 00:32:18.280
work on to more ambitious
recipes and try.

00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:19.850
A lot of the more
complicated recipes

00:32:19.850 --> 00:32:22.220
are sometimes just a
series of components.

00:32:22.220 --> 00:32:24.710
Some of the more
complicated desserts,

00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:26.830
there might be a
cookie and a cake

00:32:26.830 --> 00:32:29.116
and a custard and an ice cream.

00:32:29.116 --> 00:32:30.990
And you don't have to
make the whole dessert.

00:32:30.990 --> 00:32:33.510
The cookie, cake, the
ice cream, they're

00:32:33.510 --> 00:32:35.770
all standalone
components that are

00:32:35.770 --> 00:32:37.680
simple and easily approachable.

00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:39.130
So you can break things down.

00:32:39.130 --> 00:32:40.940
And the recipes are
written that way.

00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:44.650
But the other thing
that is-- Ten Speed

00:32:44.650 --> 00:32:47.184
was great in writing
this cookbook,

00:32:47.184 --> 00:32:48.850
in giving me almost
everything I wanted.

00:32:48.850 --> 00:32:50.540
The one thing I had
a little bit of push

00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:52.340
back on in the beginning,
and it was really

00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:54.885
the only thing I
really insisted upon--

00:32:54.885 --> 00:32:57.630
and the chefs in this room will
know what I'm talking about--

00:32:57.630 --> 00:33:04.420
is that we went to the metric
system, and we went to weights.

00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:07.650
I said, I'm not going to
do imperial measurements,

00:33:07.650 --> 00:33:10.140
and I'm not going to do volumes.

00:33:10.140 --> 00:33:14.930
And they said, you have to
because the American public is

00:33:14.930 --> 00:33:18.770
really dumb, and they gotta
cook like their grandmother.

00:33:18.770 --> 00:33:22.220
They gotta have a cup
of flour to bake a cake.

00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:24.060
You measure things
out in a cup of flour.

00:33:24.060 --> 00:33:25.160
Well, you know what?

00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:27.940
A cup of flour on a
rainy day and a cup

00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:33.980
of flour on a dry, hot day
weigh completely different.

00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:36.540
They weigh 10% in weight.

00:33:36.540 --> 00:33:41.410
10% will screw up
the recipe of baking.

00:33:41.410 --> 00:33:47.370
But 450 grams of flour weighs
450 grams on a wet day,

00:33:47.370 --> 00:33:50.980
on a cold day, on a dry day.

00:33:50.980 --> 00:33:55.350
So weight, we weigh
water in kitchens.

00:33:55.350 --> 00:33:58.540
A liter of water
weighs 1,000 grams.

00:33:58.540 --> 00:33:59.900
It's easy.

00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:01.080
It's really easy.

00:34:04.150 --> 00:34:07.180
If you weighed--
the best chef, what

00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:09.060
is the best kitchen
tool in your kitchen?

00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:11.400
What do you recommend is
the one thing I can use?

00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:14.429
A kitchen scale, a
digital kitchen scale.

00:34:14.429 --> 00:34:17.420
They cost $15.

00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:18.100
You put it on.

00:34:18.100 --> 00:34:19.670
You make a cake.

00:34:19.670 --> 00:34:25.139
Instead of measuring volumes of
flour and cracking eight eggs

00:34:25.139 --> 00:34:31.110
and measuring out 8 and
1/2 ounces of sugar,

00:34:31.110 --> 00:34:32.750
you put a bowl.

00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:34.360
You hit the tare.

00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:36.050
You put in your flour.

00:34:36.050 --> 00:34:36.929
You hit the tare.

00:34:36.929 --> 00:34:37.809
You put in the eggs.

00:34:37.809 --> 00:34:39.006
You hit the tare.

00:34:39.006 --> 00:34:39.880
You put in the flour.

00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:43.260
Instead of getting four things
dirty, you get one thing dirty.

00:34:43.260 --> 00:34:44.800
It's faster.

00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:45.949
It's cleaner.

00:34:45.949 --> 00:34:47.219
It's more efficient.

00:34:47.219 --> 00:34:50.270
It's more accurate.

00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:54.120
It's a win-win-win-win
situation.

00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:55.330
It's so easy.

00:34:55.330 --> 00:34:58.290
Metric system
changes everything.

00:34:58.290 --> 00:34:59.250
Weights change it.

00:34:59.250 --> 00:35:02.390
Guys, am I right?

00:35:02.390 --> 00:35:04.530
People say-- if you take
one thing from the book.

00:35:04.530 --> 00:35:06.330
Oh, you know, your
book is so ambitious.

00:35:06.330 --> 00:35:08.800
What is the one thing
that we can take from it?

00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:11.090
The one thing you can
take from it is, is we

00:35:11.090 --> 00:35:13.600
weigh ingredients in the
professional kitchen.

00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:15.580
You should weigh
ingredients at home,

00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:17.560
if you're going
to follow recipes.

00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:18.330
Weigh them.

00:35:18.330 --> 00:35:19.960
And it's happening.

00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:21.460
You're seeing more
and more recipes.

00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:23.376
Right now, you're seeing
imperial measurements

00:35:23.376 --> 00:35:26.280
with the metric weights
behind it in parentheses.

00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:28.370
In my book, it's
metric and the weight

00:35:28.370 --> 00:35:32.650
with the-- our compromise
was the imperials

00:35:32.650 --> 00:35:34.550
are in parentheses.

00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:36.120
In 5, 10 years,
you're going to see

00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:38.440
nothing but metric and weight.

00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:40.010
Get used to it.

00:35:40.010 --> 00:35:41.020
It's so much easier.

00:35:41.020 --> 00:35:43.780
You're going to be
shocked at how easy it is.

00:35:43.780 --> 00:35:46.030
Don't measure out a
cup of flour anymore.

00:35:46.030 --> 00:35:48.230
Weigh out 227 grams of flour.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:51.920
Lots of reading.

00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:56.820
Pre-internet, you know,
you read a lot of books,

00:35:56.820 --> 00:35:57.870
and you save your money.

00:35:57.870 --> 00:35:59.661
And you travel, and
you eat at restaurants.

00:35:59.661 --> 00:36:04.616
Because nowadays, you want
to go eat at a restaurant,

00:36:04.616 --> 00:36:07.760
you can see a 20-course menu,
25 different 20-course menus

00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:09.080
from a restaurant.

00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:11.370
And believe it or
not, I avoid that.

00:36:11.370 --> 00:36:15.210
I avoid it because
it's pollution.

00:36:15.210 --> 00:36:18.510
You see so much images, so
much food from so many--

00:36:18.510 --> 00:36:23.080
it pollutes the ability
to create your own style.

00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:25.270
If I want to go eat
at Noma in Copenhagen,

00:36:25.270 --> 00:36:28.920
I'm not going to obsess
about 15 bloggers

00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:31.500
posting all 25 courses
they had at the meal.

00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:32.980
It's too jarring.

00:36:32.980 --> 00:36:34.880
It muddles everything.

00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:36.400
It's [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:38.700
The thing to do is to
go to Noma and eat,

00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:40.980
because a photo's not
going to tell you anything.

00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:43.940
A restaurant is not
just about the food.

00:36:43.940 --> 00:36:46.860
A great restaurant experience
is about the entire experience.

00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:49.620
It's the ambiance, the food,
your mood when you go in,

00:36:49.620 --> 00:36:52.060
who you're dining
with, the weather.

00:36:52.060 --> 00:36:53.570
And we only worry
about the things

00:36:53.570 --> 00:36:55.930
that we can control, which
is food, service, ambiance.

00:36:55.930 --> 00:36:59.480
Greeting-- you come
into the restaurant,

00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:01.800
we make eye contact,
and we smile at you.

00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:05.460
And it better be genuine
because that's it.

00:37:05.460 --> 00:37:06.300
Genuine smile.

00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:07.740
No fake smiles.

00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:10.730
No, you know what
I'm talking about.

00:37:10.730 --> 00:37:12.290
You know what I'm
talking about .

00:37:12.290 --> 00:37:16.040
Every person that comes into the
restaurant, the service staff

00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:20.860
makes eye-- you don't
see that in a blog post.

00:37:20.860 --> 00:37:22.580
You don't see that
in a blog post.

00:37:22.580 --> 00:37:26.760
Chefs who obsess, I can
go into a restaurant,

00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:29.310
and I can see a chef,
and I know what cookbooks

00:37:29.310 --> 00:37:31.790
are on the shelves, what
internet sites they look at,

00:37:31.790 --> 00:37:35.480
how old they are, where they
work, whose chefs they admire.

00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:37.070
That's what the
internet has done.

00:37:37.070 --> 00:37:38.820
Now I'm not saying
that as a bad thing.

00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:40.959
There's obviously very,
very good things about it.

00:37:40.959 --> 00:37:42.500
Research, learning
about ingredients,

00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:43.291
that sort of thing.

00:37:43.291 --> 00:37:48.770
But this obsessive,
real-time Instagramming

00:37:48.770 --> 00:37:52.840
of food all the way through,
in my mind, is [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:58.500
It causes blockage in
my ability to create .

00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:01.400
We try to make it as
collaborative as possible.

00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:05.320
We meet every quarter.

00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:07.417
We try to work about
three seasons ahead.

00:38:07.417 --> 00:38:09.000
Right now, I'm going
to be meeting her

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:12.000
for fall of next year, spring
and summer for next year.

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:15.445
We make a pot of coffee,
stretch out with seed catalogs,

00:38:15.445 --> 00:38:20.164
and we talk about what we
had last year at that time,

00:38:20.164 --> 00:38:22.330
what worked, what didn't
work, what we want more of,

00:38:22.330 --> 00:38:25.210
what we want less of, new
things we want to try,

00:38:25.210 --> 00:38:29.810
things we don't want to grow
anymore, and new varieties.

00:38:29.810 --> 00:38:31.570
It's a clearly
collaborative effort.

00:38:31.570 --> 00:38:34.110
I think the big challenging
thing at Love Apple--

00:38:34.110 --> 00:38:36.084
and it took us the
longest time to do--

00:38:36.084 --> 00:38:37.750
was to cut some
[INAUDIBLE] specifically

00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:38.950
for the restaurant.

00:38:38.950 --> 00:38:42.500
At the beginning, I don't know
who gardens here, or zucchini.

00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:45.000
You know, we had way
too much zucchini.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:45.890
You don't need much.

00:38:45.890 --> 00:38:47.909
You don't need many plants.

00:38:47.909 --> 00:38:49.450
And we had way too
much salad greens,

00:38:49.450 --> 00:38:51.972
but we had these big gaps in
carrots, onions, and leeks.

00:38:51.972 --> 00:38:53.680
We'd have it for three
weeks, and then we

00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:55.540
wouldn't have anything
for six weeks.

00:38:55.540 --> 00:38:59.360
But what we had done is
fine tuned working together

00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:01.550
on what the restaurant wants
and what our needs are,

00:39:01.550 --> 00:39:05.550
our basic needs are, and what
we want to do to collaborate.

00:39:05.550 --> 00:39:07.130
And we've drawn the
correct amounts.

00:39:07.130 --> 00:39:09.004
And now we grow the
correct amount of sorrel.

00:39:09.004 --> 00:39:11.820
Now we don't gap on
carrots, that sort of thing.

00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:13.380
And to me, that's
really impressive,

00:39:13.380 --> 00:39:16.200
what she has done at the
farm to make that happen.

00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:17.860
And that said, she
always has a couple

00:39:17.860 --> 00:39:20.800
of things growing on her on,
for her own interests, that she

00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:24.185
likes to present to me and,
what do you think of this?

00:39:24.185 --> 00:39:25.480
Well, that's great.

00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:27.100
Let's work with it.

00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:29.260
We also have a lot of
seed exchange going

00:39:29.260 --> 00:39:33.830
on with different people,
Japan, France, Spain, Italy.

00:39:33.830 --> 00:39:34.600
Exchange seeds.

00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:36.810
Try new things, new product.

00:39:36.810 --> 00:39:38.750
Because a lot of the
complexity of our dishes

00:39:38.750 --> 00:39:44.650
are heirloom varieties,
really simple but carefully

00:39:44.650 --> 00:39:48.990
grown and hopefully well cooked.

00:39:48.990 --> 00:39:49.740
Thanks for coming.

00:39:49.740 --> 00:39:58.790
[APPLAUSE]
