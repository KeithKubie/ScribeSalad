1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:00,920
Okay.

2
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:01,790
Hey, what's going on?

3
00:00:01,791 --> 00:00:05,390
It's Bill Burr and It's time for the
Monday morning podcast for Monday,

4
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:12,170
July 18th, 2016 what's
going on? How are you? Um,

5
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:15,320
I hope you're good. I
hope things are well.

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,440
Has everything okay
with you in the family?

7
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:21,253
Um,

8
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:22,720
anyways, this is

9
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:27,730
the last a week of I'm writing
for emphasis for family. You know,

10
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:31,630
we got a table read today and then
tomorrow we punch up, you know,

11
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,850
fix whatever jokes didn't
work at the table read.

12
00:00:33,851 --> 00:00:37,750
And then on a Wednesday we
were, we record it and then, uh,

13
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,220
then I get my wife back.

14
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:43,150
I'm so fucking excited.

15
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:47,440
I'm so fucking excited to have this, um,

16
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:51,220
behind me all this frigging work. And um,

17
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:55,660
I'm very excited for you guys
to see this sync. Granted,

18
00:00:55,661 --> 00:00:58,750
it's animation so it'll come
out sometime fucking 20,

19
00:00:58,751 --> 00:01:01,620
36 or something. Um,

20
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,700
I dunno. Well that's how it works.
That's, that's how the process works.

21
00:01:06,701 --> 00:01:09,340
But I know the big thing is
actually writing the scripts
and we're finishing it,

22
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:12,640
uh, tomorrow after the punch up
and then I'm done. I literally,

23
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:14,560
I have the same giddiness I used to have.

24
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:19,360
Remember like the second week of June
with just even the fucking nerds didn't

25
00:01:19,361 --> 00:01:22,030
give a fuck anymore. Right. They
weren't cleaning that glasses.

26
00:01:22,031 --> 00:01:24,400
They were just showing up.
They didn't give a fuck. Right.

27
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:28,660
It teachers would dress and casual.
Everyone just was yet it's over.

28
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:32,110
It's over. Let's get the fuck Outta here.

29
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:36,610
You know, it's unbelievable.

30
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:38,741
I don't get, you know, that's,

31
00:01:38,741 --> 00:01:41,080
that's why I like sometimes when I look
at homeless people because everybody

32
00:01:41,081 --> 00:01:43,360
just wants to get the fuck
out and nobody, you know,

33
00:01:43,361 --> 00:01:46,180
you still want to work and every once in
a while you look at like these fucking

34
00:01:46,181 --> 00:01:49,360
bombs. And I don't mean like people like
try something tragic happened to them.

35
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:52,730
You know what I mean? I Dunno.

36
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:55,870
Like some sinkholes swallowed up their
fucking home and then they didn't have

37
00:01:55,871 --> 00:01:58,930
sinkhole insurance and now
they're fucking, you know,
sleeping at a bus station.

38
00:01:58,931 --> 00:02:03,460
I don't mean those people. I mean
the bumps, the old school Hobos,

39
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:07,750
the guys out there riding
the fucking railroads, right.

40
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:09,880
Let's stick with the handkerchief around.

41
00:02:09,881 --> 00:02:12,520
It went a little peanut butter and
fluff another sandwich inside of it.

42
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,590
Those guys go, they got to figure it out.

43
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:17,870
Okay.

44
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:20,300
They always feel how I feel
right now. You know why?

45
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:24,860
Because they never have to go to work.
It's always over. It's always over.

46
00:02:24,861 --> 00:02:28,940
And then, you know, what do you do? You
go to a new town, you wash some dishes.

47
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:34,400
Next thing you know, you
know you're eating beans over
a fire outside, you know,

48
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,620
eat and with the knife
or some shit, you know.

49
00:02:36,621 --> 00:02:39,290
Does that one how they used to do it or
is that just what the actors used to do

50
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:42,440
in those old movies? Trying
to make an interesting choice.

51
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:47,900
I'm going to eat with my knife. Maybe
that'll make me the next John Wayne. Um,

52
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:51,320
yeah, they have it fucking
figured out. You never done that.

53
00:02:51,321 --> 00:02:53,120
You never just walked down the
street in the middle of the day,

54
00:02:53,121 --> 00:02:54,710
in the middle of your
fucking stressful day.

55
00:02:54,711 --> 00:02:57,530
You're coming back from
lunch wondering mentally,

56
00:02:57,531 --> 00:03:00,880
how the fuck am I going to get through
next four, four and a half fucking hours.

57
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:04,690
He is walked by and you see some
homeless guy just fucking just napping,

58
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:10,750
laying on a park bench or aren't even
on the sidewalk and just so fucking

59
00:03:10,751 --> 00:03:14,620
sprawled out and just in
such a deep level of sleep.

60
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:18,610
It yet actually looks appealing
for half a second. You know,

61
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:23,320
I'd love to interview one of
those people and just be like,

62
00:03:23,321 --> 00:03:24,490
who won the Superbowl this year?

63
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:29,560
Just to see how out of the loop they
are slash how big are sports? You know,

64
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:34,810
do you know who tiger woods is?
Do you know what happened to them?

65
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:42,230
You know, are you aware that
we're at war right now still?

66
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:48,740
Where were you when it started? Were
you behind the desk? We in normal,

67
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,740
you know, do you have a soup?

68
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:54,740
Did you sit there and laugh at jokes
that you didn't think were funny,

69
00:03:54,741 --> 00:03:58,220
but just doing it to try to get to the
next level fucking cubicles that what you

70
00:03:58,221 --> 00:04:02,060
did. At what point did you
just decide, fuck this.

71
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,270
I want to take a nap when I want to nap.

72
00:04:05,271 --> 00:04:08,810
Can you imagine if you were allowed
to nap whenever you wanted to nap?

73
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:13,790
How much better the world would be? You
could just be at work and just be like,

74
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:18,320
Eh, you know what? I'm got to go lay
it out for about fucking 20 minutes.

75
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:22,160
Just go over and curl up in a
fucking ball and that'll be it.

76
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:27,500
You know what I'm trying to
say people's, I'm very excited.

77
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:31,400
As much as I enjoy writing these
fucking things, it's just great. Dead A,

78
00:04:31,401 --> 00:04:34,100
you know, I'm looking at my dog
right now, just fucking chilling out.

79
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:38,420
Just fucking laying there. She's laying
there. She's she, I don't even know why.

80
00:04:38,421 --> 00:04:39,254
She's tired.

81
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,910
Fucking tired from all you got damn
sleep and I'm jealousy. You cleo, CLIA,

82
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:50,420
nothing. She knows I'm talking about
her, but she doesn't give a shit.

83
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,060
She's fucking tapped out.
She's laying on the rug.

84
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:57,410
There's a little bit of Sun spilling in
from the window and she picked the sunny

85
00:04:57,411 --> 00:05:01,610
warm part of the rug and that is it.
That's all the fuck she needs. You know?

86
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:07,340
No upward mobility. She's not working
on her next fucking season of a,

87
00:05:07,341 --> 00:05:12,170
you know, fucking the real pit bulls
of the greater Los Angeles area.

88
00:05:12,171 --> 00:05:15,080
She doesn't give a fuck. She's got
nothing on her agenda every day.

89
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,340
It's fucking tremendous.

90
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,870
Maybe that's why their lives are
only 10 to 15 years, you know,

91
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:22,730
they just get to live
like the all, you know,

92
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,010
cause when you look at your
whole life, if you're lucky,

93
00:05:25,011 --> 00:05:29,880
you get 10 to 15 years total of just
bliss. And the rest of it, you know,

94
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,130
it was just dealing with some cotton,

95
00:05:31,131 --> 00:05:33,110
with coffee breath telling
you you didn't have enough,

96
00:05:33,111 --> 00:05:35,090
you didn't bring the right fucking forms.

97
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:38,720
You got to go back home and go get
something else and stand in line again.

98
00:05:38,721 --> 00:05:41,240
That's, that's what the rest of your
life is like. But if you're lucky,

99
00:05:41,241 --> 00:05:43,970
10 to 15 fucking years of it, you know,

100
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:46,460
you get to live like my dog right now,

101
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:49,100
taking a nap on the sunny part of the rug.

102
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:56,270
By the way, there's so much
shit going on right now,

103
00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:00,920
like on the Internet, on the inner
web that I just don't understand.

104
00:06:00,921 --> 00:06:05,770
What is the big fucking deal. You know,
that whole George Bush dancing thing,

105
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:10,090
I looked that up thinking he was going
to be just an absolute fucking lunatic.

106
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:14,380
Like, oh no, stop, stop. You're
making all white dudes look bad.

107
00:06:14,381 --> 00:06:17,620
Everybody already knows we can't
dance. It wasn't bad at all.

108
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,990
You look like he was in a good mood.

109
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:21,750
Yeah.

110
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:25,200
You know his fucking energy. It's
like I get that fucking energy. He,

111
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:30,270
he showing up. He's a patriotic son
of a bitch. That's his jam. You know,

112
00:06:30,271 --> 00:06:34,260
we sways a little bit and you know
what's great too is in his head,

113
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:38,790
he's laughing at Obama. Like, go on.
I ha you still have to do that job,

114
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:40,170
George Bush.

115
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:44,400
It's on summer vacation and the fucking
look he has on his face says the same.

116
00:06:44,401 --> 00:06:47,820
Look, I have all I got to get through.

117
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:52,190
I just gotta get through fucking, uh,
basically tomorrow. Get through the,

118
00:06:52,191 --> 00:06:54,780
the next rewrite and then
that's it. And of course,

119
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:57,150
you know the be a zillion
punch ups and editing sessions,

120
00:06:57,151 --> 00:07:01,920
but like the fucking daily
grind is a, it's done.

121
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:05,010
That's where George Bush
is at right now. You know,

122
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,300
he fucking launched the
missiles. All right?

123
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:13,170
Bunch of fucking people
died. He's mentally past it.

124
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:17,610
He bought his pieces of land down in
South America that sit on aquifers.

125
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:22,260
You know? Who knows? Maybe he goes
out and he gets a fucking 12 pack.

126
00:07:22,261 --> 00:07:24,690
I don't know. He just looked
like a really fucking happy guy.

127
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:30,780
Since when does a president have to know
how to fucking dance? He does it. Oh,

128
00:07:30,781 --> 00:07:35,781
his fucking job is to get on
TV and scare the shit out.

129
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,940
Scare the shit out of you about whatever.

130
00:07:38,941 --> 00:07:41,910
The fucking people above them who want
to make money on something. You know,

131
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:45,630
we got to get these people. We gotta get
those people. We gotta get some people.

132
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:50,250
There's some people out there to come and
get you going to get you these people.

133
00:07:50,251 --> 00:07:53,900
Malley's playing pool
lock. You Lino whack.

134
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:58,590
You sitting there on your couch. It's
like, how the fuck do they not like me?

135
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:03,000
They don't even know me.
I haven't interacted with
these cuts. You know who has,

136
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:07,890
you have their Fucko. What did you
and your friends do to Piss them off?

137
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:08,783
You know what I mean?

138
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,490
You went out and you pissed
off another fucking country.

139
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:17,150
Now you're trying to make it seem like
they're out [inaudible] coming after me.

140
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:20,090
They're coming after you. You con they're
never gonna get to you. You know why?

141
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:21,950
Because you have security
and I don't, you know,

142
00:08:21,951 --> 00:08:26,450
I'm just fucking sitting here
sitting here with a Mug of fucking t.

143
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:29,720
Okay.

144
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,670
That would be great. Collectively
if the world did that, you know,

145
00:08:31,671 --> 00:08:35,030
in the world leaders, right? All of
them, they wanted to start a war.

146
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:38,650
It'd be like eight people and those who
all the people, little fucker, you know,

147
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:41,610
the infidels and all that. Everybody
just, all regular people just sat there.

148
00:08:41,611 --> 00:08:44,990
I released that. What's going on? Well
listen dude, if you got a beef with them,

149
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,580
why don't you go fucking settle it?

150
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:49,010
Cause I've never talked to
those people and then that's it.

151
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:54,080
Then we watch it on pay per view,
you know, slap fights, world leader,

152
00:08:54,081 --> 00:08:58,250
slap fights, you know, and it
doesn't solve anything other than,

153
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:03,350
than we just get to enjoy complete
fucking sociopathic money,

154
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:09,180
power hungry. Fucking psychos. Just
slapping each other in the face. You know?

155
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:12,330
Didn't we just get to sit in the
crowd eating popcorn going? Yeah.

156
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:16,580
Oh, oh.

157
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:19,790
Watching them slapping each other.

158
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:22,810
That's his, as you know, something,
if we were really civilized,

159
00:09:22,811 --> 00:09:27,100
that's as far as it would go. You know,
we just sit there and watch, you know,

160
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,710
Obama have a slap fight with the al
Qaeda guy or a fucking isis guy and then

161
00:09:32,711 --> 00:09:35,200
that would be it. And there'd be
nobody underneath any of them.

162
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,970
I wouldn't even be Obama.
It would be the fucking,

163
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,110
the corporate cuts who make all the
fucking money off the misery. I'm sorry.

164
00:09:43,111 --> 00:09:44,970
People just that, that
you know, I don't know.

165
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:47,540
Okay.

166
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:50,630
I hate how they always act
like the world is going crazy.

167
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:54,680
The world is not going crazy. You
just keep showing the crazy shit.

168
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:58,220
It's like these fucking lunatics said
[inaudible] who drove the fucking truck

169
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:01,340
into the people? It's like,
why? Why did that guy do that?

170
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,870
People never did shit like that,
at least to to the, to the,

171
00:10:05,871 --> 00:10:10,380
when I was growing up, people did not do
shit like that, at least as far as the,

172
00:10:10,381 --> 00:10:13,430
the sheer amount of these
fucking incidents now.

173
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:18,560
And I really think it's because,
I think it's the news coverage.

174
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,170
They wanted their last act on earth.

175
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,900
They want people to then be like
inside the crazy mind of Jill blow,

176
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:29,570
he, he was born in there, they get
to do his whole fucking backstory.

177
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:31,100
I think that that's
what they're going for.

178
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:35,510
So obviously when something like that
happens, you got to report on it.

179
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:37,610
But I don't think, I don't
want to know the person's name.

180
00:10:37,611 --> 00:10:38,690
I don't want no fucking thing.

181
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:42,620
But they should die
completely fucking anonymous.

182
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:47,430
And I think if they maybe, why
don't we try that? You know,

183
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:50,160
instead of, you know, the
people who get fucking killed,

184
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:53,760
maybe they talk about him for
fucking, you know, once or whatever.

185
00:10:53,761 --> 00:10:57,270
But the person who fucking
kills everybody, you know,

186
00:10:57,271 --> 00:11:01,270
they get their own little fucking half
hour, hour long special. You know,

187
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:06,000
as news people sit there with their
brow furrowed, you know, disturbing,

188
00:11:06,001 --> 00:11:06,834
disturbing

189
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,900
Malema Blahblahblahblahblah
and they fucking talk about
it for 24 hours and they

190
00:11:10,901 --> 00:11:15,030
make a zillion dollars in advertising.
Oh, I'm a fucking cynical con today.

191
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:19,410
Absolutely. But by the way,
that Bush dancing thing was,

192
00:11:19,411 --> 00:11:22,500
that was not bad at all. He looked
like he was, he was in a great mood.

193
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,890
And you know what? Good for him.
Good for him. That fucking dope

194
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,680
guy say he's it dope. I can't really
say he's a Dopa guy. You guys bilingual,

195
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,410
right? You've got to have
some sort of brains in there.

196
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:38,580
You smart enough to realize
he didn't belong at Yale,

197
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:42,460
so he fucking drowned it in a 12
pack every 20 minutes. I mean, I,

198
00:11:42,461 --> 00:11:45,180
I relate to the guy. Um,

199
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:46,600
yeah.

200
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,130
Anyways. Oh, by the way,

201
00:11:48,131 --> 00:11:52,060
if one more person fucking tweets
me about that stupid suspension,

202
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:53,990
the Tom Brady Think d,

203
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:57,400
the sheer amount of people that don't
even understand that at that has nothing

204
00:11:57,401 --> 00:11:58,234
to do.

205
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:00,290
Okay.

206
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:04,610
You know, like all of a sudden it was
proven that easy. He is a Chichi cheater.

207
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:09,710
Now, that's not what that was about. The
first one that was the, did he cheat?

208
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:13,850
And that went to a court of law and was
laughed out of court. The second one,

209
00:12:13,851 --> 00:12:16,850
all that was was the NFL. They
changed their argument. They go,

210
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:21,470
we're a corporation. He's our employee.
Do we have the right to suspend him?

211
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:25,010
And the court was like, yes, you do.
And then they came back and they said,

212
00:12:25,011 --> 00:12:25,760
hey Tom,

213
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:30,230
remember that fucking trial we had
with no fucking evidence whatsoever?

214
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:33,290
That kind of evidence that gets
laughed out of court. Well,

215
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,350
we're going to uphold it
so you're suspended. So

216
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:39,390
that's basically what happens.

217
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:45,890
I just don't, I don't know people
here. What the fuck they want to hear.

218
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:47,900
All right. Um,

219
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:52,730
all freckles has been
working out all freckles.

220
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:57,950
He's been working out. I told you I was
up to one 86 and fucking change, uh,

221
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,390
stepped on the scale this week,

222
00:12:59,391 --> 00:13:03,980
one 82 and change telling the first
week he can always drop three to four,

223
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:07,760
because it's such a shock to
your system of like, holy fuck,

224
00:13:07,761 --> 00:13:10,580
we're doing this now. If you just start
eating healthy, working out, right?

225
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:14,630
You stop beating around
five or six o'clock and just
crush waters and you don't

226
00:13:14,631 --> 00:13:17,210
eat again until late the next
morning. You know, I'm telling you,

227
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:20,930
you can drop three to four now.

228
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:24,440
Now I'm in my second week of this shit,

229
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:29,600
so I want to get down to one 79 and
then the week after that one 76.

230
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:31,820
So I'm in the mid one seventies
when I go over to Europe.

231
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:36,670
So I represent my fucking country
properly. Okay? All those European cons,

232
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:41,090
they want nothing more than for me to
go over there and be some fat. Fuck,

233
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:44,210
you know, who doesn't know what's going
on in the world. That's what they want.

234
00:13:44,211 --> 00:13:47,630
So what you do is, is you
show up in shape, right?

235
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:51,290
You go on Wikipedia, you Google
their fucking city, right?

236
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:54,440
You find out what's going on and
then you just pretend you read,

237
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:59,210
you sit there with your flat stomach
and you pretend like you've read.

238
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:02,270
That's what you do. And you
know what? It irritates him.

239
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,390
I'm fucking with you anyway.

240
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:09,770
So I'm down to one 82 and uh,

241
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:14,090
one 79 next week, the big
seven, I got to see that man,

242
00:14:14,091 --> 00:14:16,250
that second number's gotta
be a seven. It can't,

243
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:21,080
I refuse to be an eight or higher
ever. Uh, I just can't fucking do it.

244
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,300
Although having said that at my age,

245
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:28,400
how slow my metabolism is and how much
I like to fucking eat and drink and all

246
00:14:28,401 --> 00:14:32,180
of that shit, I could easily, I could
hit two bills. Like if I really,

247
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:33,260
okay,

248
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:37,430
like just shut it all down as
far as moving around, you know,

249
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:42,590
I just stopped doing shows and I just
sat here like my dog, I swear to God,

250
00:14:42,591 --> 00:14:46,400
dude, I could be 200 pounds by
the beginning of October. Easy.

251
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:48,250
Right?

252
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:50,860
That's not even fucking trying
without even fucking trying.

253
00:14:50,861 --> 00:14:53,420
If I just ate what the fuck
I wanted to eat, oh my God.

254
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,140
Is there a worse site than a fucking,

255
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:00,820
okay.

256
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:04,780
Five, nine and three quarter
210 pound redheaded male.

257
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:07,810
And that's not something that you
want to see. And I don't mean muscle,

258
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:11,080
I just mean coming at you
looking like, you know,

259
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:16,300
I work at dairy queen and I'm constantly
taking advantage of my employee

260
00:15:16,301 --> 00:15:18,220
discount. Nobody wants to see that. Right?

261
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:21,910
It's not a man looking like my legs.

262
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:26,940
My pasty fat fucking legs as white is
to soft serve vanilla ice cream that I

263
00:15:27,161 --> 00:15:31,870
have every 20 minutes. So anyways,

264
00:15:31,871 --> 00:15:36,790
I'm going to get down to
'em once 79 next week.

265
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:38,883
Um,

266
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:43,320
I just been fucking hitting the
God damn elliptical and a dude.

267
00:15:43,321 --> 00:15:48,050
My sciatica is just completely
fucking gone. Uh, I'm going for not,

268
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:52,320
I'm getting massage every fucking
week, right. That deep tissue.

269
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:55,770
Just somebody beats the shit out of
you and I'm getting all of this stuff.

270
00:15:57,020 --> 00:16:00,920
All of these fucking wall is crap that
was in my legs from all of these years.

271
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,003
Um,

272
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:08,030
flying on planes, playing pickup
hockey with no hockey stuff.

273
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:13,460
You know, they tell you guys that
shit. No, I don't think I did. Yeah,

274
00:16:13,461 --> 00:16:18,461
I had another fucking massage and this
lady had an elbow jam so far into the

275
00:16:19,221 --> 00:16:21,170
back of my leg, my hamstring.

276
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,890
I was like having memories of
every time I fucked up my leg,

277
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:28,670
she hit a spot and I'd be like,
and then I'd be like, Oh yeah,

278
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:32,870
that was the time I played pickup
hockey and all I had was gloves,

279
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,530
a helmet and a stick. And I
was playing defense. Right.

280
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:39,350
And I'm skating full speed, you know,

281
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,260
cause we have the puck and all of a
sudden they steal it and they tried to

282
00:16:42,261 --> 00:16:44,480
fucking turn around and go
back the other way. Dude.

283
00:16:44,481 --> 00:16:46,390
And I caught an edge who's getting hurt?

284
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:50,210
I suck at skating and could barely go
backwards and I fucking shot up in the air

285
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:55,250
and landed on my left side ass
cheek all the way down to my thigh.

286
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:59,510
I landed so hard, I didn't even
hit my head and I still saw stars.

287
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:03,860
And uh, that was one of those things
where I didn't even try to get up.

288
00:17:03,861 --> 00:17:05,480
I just sat there for a second,

289
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:09,260
just waiting for everything
to settle afterwards and then

290
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:16,310
fucking, I got up fast enough before
everybody came over and said, dude,

291
00:17:16,311 --> 00:17:18,200
you are right. You are right.
You don't want to be that guy.

292
00:17:18,201 --> 00:17:22,940
And I just fucking like, you know,
skated over the bench, one leg working.

293
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:26,870
I was just like, Eh, hey,
oh hey, all the way over.

294
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:31,850
And I just sat down and like, I,
you know, you know, pick up hockey,

295
00:17:31,851 --> 00:17:34,490
people skate over and they pointed
at you. I shook off like three,

296
00:17:34,491 --> 00:17:35,430
three times and I,

297
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:40,560
and before I went back out there
and the bruise was so deep,

298
00:17:40,971 --> 00:17:43,040
it didn't show up for like three days.

299
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:48,430
Like three days later I was on the
road and I'm showering and you know,

300
00:17:48,741 --> 00:17:52,680
I, I s I thought I saw like a bunch of
grease on the back of my leg. I'm like,

301
00:17:52,681 --> 00:17:55,050
what the fuck did I sit on?
And then I saw it was a Bruce.

302
00:17:55,051 --> 00:17:59,550
It literally looked like somebody just
took a bat and hit me right across the

303
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:03,480
back of my left leg.
And, um, you know, Evan,

304
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:06,330
this is kind of what I learned. I
thought like when the bruise went away,

305
00:18:06,331 --> 00:18:10,950
then you were all fine. Uh, but
evidently that's not the deal. Um,

306
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:13,220
the reason why it takes that long,

307
00:18:13,221 --> 00:18:15,800
I guess for it to come to the
surface is because it's so fucking,

308
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:20,600
whatever you hit was so fucking deep
into the muscle. It took that long for a,

309
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:23,150
I forget the person explained it to me,

310
00:18:23,151 --> 00:18:25,460
a bunch of busted capillaries
or something like that.

311
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:28,430
And then when they go to heels,
sometimes they confuse to something else.

312
00:18:28,431 --> 00:18:32,660
I don't know, fuse to a nerve or some
shit. I have no idea. I don't remember.

313
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:35,990
I don't pretend to remember,
but all I know is um,

314
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:40,220
a bunch of shit like that
happened slash you know,

315
00:18:40,221 --> 00:18:44,030
flying on planes and sitting on my
fucking ass and writers' rooms and that's

316
00:18:44,031 --> 00:18:46,970
what's going to happen. But
what I love is, you know,

317
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,970
all these people who have back problems
with telling me that all, dude,

318
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,760
you're going to have this for the rest
of your life and blah, blah, blah, blah,

319
00:18:52,761 --> 00:18:54,080
blah. I mean,

320
00:18:54,081 --> 00:18:57,620
I didn't fly helicopter for like fucking
three months during this cause when I

321
00:18:57,621 --> 00:18:58,161
sat down,

322
00:18:58,161 --> 00:19:01,550
my feet went numb and I can't have my
fucking feet going numb when I'm trying to

323
00:19:01,551 --> 00:19:06,530
touch the pedals. There. Um, but no,

324
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,810
I, if you find, if you find a fucking,

325
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,390
a real miss Seuss of
fucking incredible one,

326
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:13,610
they could figure out what
the fuck's wrong with you.

327
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:15,170
And even beyond a chiropractor,

328
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:18,890
they beat the fuck out of you and they
loosen everything up and then everything

329
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:21,380
relaxes and you go back to being normal.

330
00:19:21,381 --> 00:19:24,400
At least that's what the
fuck happened with me at. Uh,

331
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:28,460
I flew for the first time Wednesday.
I was tremendous. That was tremendous.

332
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:33,590
I got, oh Jesus Christ. Look at that.
Is that this? Is that a fucking raven?

333
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:39,540
Hey. Hey. Get all the chin.

334
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,220
Get out of here.

335
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:45,320
Jesus Christ.

336
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:50,320
How old am I that I had a yell that long
in a bird before it left back in the

337
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:54,080
day. I stepped on a stick in the fucking
thing took off. What does that mean?

338
00:19:54,081 --> 00:19:58,160
Was that a crow or a fucking raven? All
right. We got to look this shit up here.

339
00:19:58,161 --> 00:20:01,970
Some fucking ancient medieval
history shit for you,

340
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:07,840
Raven. Uh, what did you say here? Raven.

341
00:20:07,841 --> 00:20:10,120
I'm Super

342
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:14,550
Raven's superstition. All right,
little. What do we got here?

343
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:19,440
What do we got here? Ravens?
Symbolism. Ravens. Symbolism.

344
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:24,300
Myths of the Raven symbolisms and lore.

345
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:29,700
Learn about the lore of ravens Burt. I
know that's what I'm here for. All right.

346
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:34,860
The Raven often has a bad press for
being a carrion, a carry and burn.

347
00:20:34,861 --> 00:20:36,900
I know what that means.
C, A. R. R. I. O. N.

348
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:40,890
It is ultimately associated
with death. Tremendous.

349
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:42,420
Finally getting fucking healthy.

350
00:20:42,421 --> 00:20:47,380
Now I'm going to die and consequently
considered a bad Omand by many or a

351
00:20:47,381 --> 00:20:51,310
forewarning of war. Jesus.
Nia is gonna yell at me.

352
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:53,570
But there is much more to this egg, egg,

353
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:57,280
dramatic and intelligent bird than
death, darkness and destruction.

354
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:00,880
Raven is a trickster or
protector, a teacher,

355
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:02,920
and a bringer of great magic.

356
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:07,660
I would love to see the person who wrote
this, like what they would dress like.

357
00:21:07,661 --> 00:21:10,270
I just pictured them in like a
fucking Toga with the leaves.

358
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:13,600
You know the hats they'd
have leaves on the side.

359
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:17,200
It's like if you had a full head of leaf
hair and then you went bald and just

360
00:21:17,201 --> 00:21:21,260
fucking wrapped around you. Um, learn
all about the raven and it's Laura here.

361
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:23,410
Well, that's what the fuck.
I'm here for your comments.

362
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:25,960
Okay.

363
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:29,050
All right. So Raven is not only the
largest member of the crow family. Oh,

364
00:21:29,051 --> 00:21:29,980
I didn't know that.

365
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:31,400
[inaudible]

366
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:35,630
it's the big brother, but the
largest perching bird in the world.

367
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:42,250
I thought they all perched the others
who lay down an extremely intelligent

368
00:21:42,251 --> 00:21:44,620
bird. The Raven was once extremely common,

369
00:21:44,621 --> 00:21:49,180
but persecution now finds it only
in remotes areas such as cliffs,

370
00:21:49,181 --> 00:21:52,480
mountains, and moon and
more moons and Moore's.

371
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,290
It's amazing the amount of English words.
I already know what they are, Morris.

372
00:21:56,300 --> 00:22:01,290
I thought those were Africans. I just,

373
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:02,250
I don't fucking, I don't,

374
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:06,930
I evidently was a crow cause I don't have
any of those things. There's no clip.

375
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,220
There's no mountain. I have a porch.

376
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:12,660
The adult is completely black
with a shaggy thre. I don't care.

377
00:22:12,661 --> 00:22:13,890
What the fuck does it mean?

378
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:20,450
Ravens are extremely intelligent in
some cases, can even learn to talk.

379
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:24,220
All right. That wasn't a fucking raven.
I was just yelling at it. Hey, hey.

380
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:25,400
Would've been like, what?

381
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:26,783
Okay.

382
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:29,530
That would've freaked me out. I'd be
like, Oh, you know, I was just wondering.

383
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:32,070
I wonder if you'd leave. There'll be cool.

384
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:35,500
The wolf and the Raven are often
mentioned together in mythology, lore,

385
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:39,990
and scripture in nature. The wolf and
the raven have an important relationship.

386
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:45,170
Wolves use ravens as an Ariel Ariel
spotters for possible sources of food as

387
00:22:45,421 --> 00:22:47,880
well as using them to
alert them of danger ahead.

388
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:53,040
The Raven also gains from
this relationship with the
wolf being carrying birds.

389
00:22:53,041 --> 00:22:57,900
I'm so sick of reading that fucking word.
What does it mean? C A. R. R. I. O. O.

390
00:22:57,901 --> 00:22:58,734
N. You know it's funny,

391
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:01,170
the amount of people that are listening
to this right now and they feel superior

392
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:04,100
to me cause they know what this word
means. Yeah. And what does that getting?

393
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,670
Is that going to buy you a sandwich today?

394
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:11,030
Did the king flush of dead animals?

395
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:12,740
Okay.

396
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:16,700
Okay. So that's what it needs.
All right, so it's like a fucking,

397
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:21,580
it's like one of those birds of vulture
birds with the fucking red head.

398
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:22,730
No fucking feathers.

399
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:26,780
I know why they don't have feathers on
their heads because they're always eaten

400
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:29,300
at dead carcasses. And they don't
want the maggots to get in there.

401
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:32,210
So they do whatever fucking bacteria
and shit gets on their head,

402
00:23:32,211 --> 00:23:35,000
just gets burned off by the
sun. Although I can't tell you.

403
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:39,290
I look like a raven after what? Not a
raven of. I look like a fucking vulture.

404
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:42,440
If I go to the beach, big
fucking redhead, you know,

405
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:47,930
and I eat dead meat too. Right? Ham.
That's a dead pig. Jesus Christ.

406
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:49,940
This is an incredible article. All right.

407
00:23:49,941 --> 00:23:53,300
The Raven also gains from its
relationship at the, okay.

408
00:23:53,301 --> 00:23:55,880
Obviously if the wolf fucking kill
something, what? Jesus Christ.

409
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:59,450
I don't think I can find two more boring
animals on the planet than those two

410
00:23:59,451 --> 00:24:00,980
fuckers. I think they deserve each other.

411
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:06,140
They probably both in bed by eight
every night. Um, alright, let me,

412
00:24:06,141 --> 00:24:09,350
let me do a couple of fucking reads
here. You got a lot of advertising.

413
00:24:09,351 --> 00:24:12,300
We didn't have any on fucking
Thursday, so I gotta make up for 'em.

414
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:17,540
I gotta make up for this shit here. All
right. Hey, uh, hey, I'm no, no, no.

415
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:21,140
That's a read actually here.
I need the advertising.

416
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:25,330
Where the fuck is he advertising? All
right. Hey Bill, he's grips. Strength. Ah,

417
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:28,910
you fucking jerk off. You
did the same one twice.

418
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:31,460
Is He really going to
be one of these days?

419
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:38,600
All right. Hang on a
second people. I apologize.

420
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:40,790
Hang on.

421
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:42,190
Okay,

422
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:47,100
content reads. There we go. Our
all. Here we go. Track or everybody.

423
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:50,100
Smart cars, smart phones, smart homes.

424
00:24:50,101 --> 00:24:54,180
Technology has made everything
wicked smart. But losing your stuff,

425
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:59,370
make smart people feel really stupid.
Kid Tracker makes lose things.

426
00:24:59,371 --> 00:25:04,371
A thing of the past tracker is a coin
size device that locates misplaced keys,

427
00:25:04,951 --> 00:25:07,860
wallets, bag, computers,

501
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:29,920
All right? Whether you're
wearing a suit or sweats,

502
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:33,400
you spend almost 24 hours
a day in your underwear.

503
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:37,600
But instead of making a statement like
Superman's tights under his everyday

504
00:29:37,601 --> 00:29:38,380

509
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:53,380

510
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:54,430
but once you try them on,

going to read those later.

523
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:40,030
Let's get back to the fucking
podcast. Here I am sweating.

524
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:45,220
Roche didn't bake in boy. Um,
you don't actually checked in.

525
00:30:45,221 --> 00:30:47,110
I checked in on the world of baseball.

526
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:51,610
I have not looked at all my fucking
Boston red socks, if I can call them that.

527
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:56,790
Or a game out behind the Baltimore Orioles
and were in between two dirty birds,

528
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,530
Orioles and Blue Jays, right?

529
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:03,400
Yankees are in fourth Tampa Bay's
bringing up the fucking rear.

530
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:08,400
Here's what's interesting to me in first
place. You got Cleveland. All right,

531
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,370
you got Baltimore.

532
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:14,410
They have not won a world series since
1983 you got the Cleveland Indians.

533
00:31:14,411 --> 00:31:17,680
They haven't won since like
fucking was in 1948 or something.

534
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:22,480
Texas has never won. You
got the Washington senators,

535
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:26,670
they're in first place. They used
to be the expos. They never want,

536
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:31,680
they should've won in 94 but the
fucking strikes fucking cutoff the whole

537
00:31:31,871 --> 00:31:34,270
season. The Chicago cubs,

538
00:31:34,271 --> 00:31:39,271
they haven't won since 1907 and then the
San Francisco giants who've won every

539
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:44,260
other year, this decade. All right, look,

540
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,930
you have to fucking Los Angeles
Dodgers and only game and half out.

541
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,620
I have no fucking clue because they're
not on my cable service because they had

542
00:31:50,621 --> 00:31:54,730
some fucking [inaudible] fight
with somebody. It's just the worst.

543
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:58,840
So this is pretty cool. Man, what a
great year for baseball, you know,

544
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:03,310
all right. If I had to, if I could
see Baltimore, Cleveland or Texas,

545
00:32:03,311 --> 00:32:07,990
I would pick Cleveland. If I could
see Washington cubs or San Francisco,

546
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,360
you got to go with the cubs, right? No,

547
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:14,680
there foofy fucking fans taking their
shirts off at the fucking games.

548
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:19,390
They don't give a shit. Right? So if it
was Cleveland versus the cubs, you know,

549
00:32:19,391 --> 00:32:22,930
I gotta go with Cleveland.
They just wanted an NBA title.

550
00:32:22,931 --> 00:32:26,470
Let's see them get the fucking, you know,

551
00:32:26,471 --> 00:32:29,500
the monkey off their back with
baseball. And I would root for the cubs.

552
00:32:29,501 --> 00:32:31,390
But I just don't think
that people care enough.

553
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:35,830
Every time I say may out it up all good.

554
00:32:35,831 --> 00:32:39,190
It's just too fucking happy
there. And I also blame,

555
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:43,760
I really feel like because they do that
stupid shit and the seventh inning,

556
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:48,860
that's why the fucking, uh, you know,

557
00:32:48,861 --> 00:32:51,320
the Yankees play, why MCA?

558
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:55,160
And that's why the red sox play that
fucking horrific sweet. Caroline.

559
00:32:55,910 --> 00:33:00,350
The cubs started it. And because
you created that, and I have to,

560
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:03,920
anytime I see a red sox game and I have
to watch a woman put her head on the

561
00:33:03,921 --> 00:33:07,460
shoulder of a boyfriend during the
seventh things stretch is everybody sings

562
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:10,580
that horrifically creepy
fucking song. You know,

563
00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:14,360
I kind of hope the cubs go another a
hundred and fucking six years. 100.

564
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:18,320
They're up to 108 years.
You know what I mean?

565
00:33:18,321 --> 00:33:20,300
Not even the Phillies went that long.

566
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:23,780
The biggest losers and professionals
and they always want lost more fucking

567
00:33:23,781 --> 00:33:27,010
games than those cons. Um,
and they went, almost done.

568
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:31,490
They went from like 1880 to
1980 or like 1882 to 1980.

569
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:34,310
Let me see. Chicago cubs,

570
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:40,040
Chicago cubs, last world. Look at that.

571
00:33:40,041 --> 00:33:44,000
Comes right up. 1907 I'm sorry,

572
00:33:44,001 --> 00:33:47,370
1908 would you look at that?

573
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:51,090
So it's been a hundred
and fucking eight years.

574
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:52,750
Okay.

575
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:56,050
They should keep it going at that
point. You know what I mean? You just,

576
00:33:56,051 --> 00:33:58,600
you just be who you are. Right.

577
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:02,050
Plus the fucking white sox one. One.

578
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:05,440
I don't understand cities that have
two fucking teams. I just don't get it.

579
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:09,190
And one of the team wins it and you
don't go to the parade. It's like it's,

580
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:10,870
it represents your city.

581
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:12,533
Okay,

582
00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:18,950
well dude, fuck ribs. You mean how many
fucking teams do unique New York City?

583
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:23,780
Evidently in order to remain successful
for as much shit as New York City talks,

584
00:34:23,781 --> 00:34:26,420
they need two football
teams, two baseball teams,

585
00:34:26,421 --> 00:34:28,730
two Paskett ball teams
and two hockey teams.

586
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:32,240
Fucking unbelievable.

587
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:36,170
I Dunno if you come from
a real city like Boston,

588
00:34:36,171 --> 00:34:40,520
you just need four and a fucking socket
team and they'll all went championships.

589
00:34:40,521 --> 00:34:44,150
If you know what the fuck you doing,
you don't have to hedge your bets.

590
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:48,500
Doubled down in every
fucking sport telling you,

591
00:34:50,370 --> 00:34:53,940
you know, it's really making, my day
is Rappaport. It's just been lately.

592
00:34:53,941 --> 00:34:57,960
The guys just teach us, won't
fucking leave me alone. He was all,

593
00:34:57,961 --> 00:35:01,500
he was another one guy all excited
about the Tom Brady fucking, I was like,

594
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:04,250
Michael, I agree with the suspension. Uh,

595
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:08,400
corporations should be allowed to suspend
an employee even if it is complete

596
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:11,850
horseshit. He, I just
don't, he's a giants fan.

597
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:14,190
They fucking own the
patriots in the Superbowl.

598
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:16,260
Why can't he just be happy with that?

599
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:20,160
You know what it is about New York
fans is when they look at Boston fans,

600
00:35:20,161 --> 00:35:23,610
they don't see the misery anymore.
You know, we can talk shit.

601
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:26,370
It's fucking great and they
don't know how to handle it.

602
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:29,730
They want us to be miserable
again and we're not.

603
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:34,530
And it's driving them nuts in like the
misery that Rapoport has that I'm not

604
00:35:34,531 --> 00:35:39,120
miserable. That's the kind of people
that these New York sports feds are.

605
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:41,940
That's why they got to get
all of these fucking teams.

606
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:48,330
They're like a fucking a, they're like
Walmart. They're trying to fucking,

607
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:51,000
you know, have so many locations.

608
00:35:51,001 --> 00:35:53,520
They put everybody else out of
fucking business. It's just,

609
00:35:53,521 --> 00:35:57,000
it's not going to happen. It's not
going to fucking happen. All right,

610
00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:00,050
so why don't, why don't you get
three teams in every sport then?

611
00:36:00,051 --> 00:36:04,110
Maybe you could run the table in 10
years. You fucking cons. All right.

612
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:08,250
Um, ah, God. Who would ever
thought as a Boston sports fan,

613
00:36:08,251 --> 00:36:10,560
I could just sit here and laugh
at New York sports friends.

614
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:13,860
I never thought that that was
going to happen. You know,

615
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:17,520
here I am all fucking happy.

616
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:23,430
Ah, fuck. What am I up to? 36 minutes.
Okay, here we go. Here we go. All right.

617
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:27,660
Hey, let's do some reads here.
Hey Billy, grip strength.

618
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:31,580
I'm one of your listeners
wrote in last week, uh,

619
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:34,560
wrote in last week to ask
about his hairy girlfriend.

620
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:38,460
I'm not sure what he ended up telling
her or if he sent you an update.

621
00:36:38,461 --> 00:36:43,461
But unfortunately I've had experience
with this on a couple of occasions.

622
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:47,250
Now for those of you who
didn't listen the other day,

623
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:51,030
this guy was dating this Brazilian
woman, you know, so you know,

624
00:36:51,031 --> 00:36:54,870
she's fucking smoking hot, but you
know, she just had a little issue.

625
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,110
She had a little bit of fern,
her fucking arms and uh,

626
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:03,180
with a tramp stamp would go, you know,
the tattoo could get lost in the weeds,

627
00:37:03,181 --> 00:37:03,931
if you know what I mean.

628
00:37:03,931 --> 00:37:08,180
So he wanted to tell her to fucking
wax a little bit cause you know,

629
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:12,610
I mean Jesus Christ, you know,

630
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:17,130
doing it doggystyle and she's got like
a fucking Afro just above a booty crack.

631
00:37:17,131 --> 00:37:21,900
I mean, yeah. I mean what, what,
what's going on with that? So,

632
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:27,030
but how do you tell somebody that, I mean,
women can tell guys that in a second.

633
00:37:27,031 --> 00:37:31,260
Like you should wax your back. I
don't know. Yeah, just grosses me out.

634
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:35,400
And you're like, all right, if that's
what it takes to have you keep fucking me.

635
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:40,350
Right. You can't tell these
ladies anything. You know,

636
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:45,870
honey, I love you to death, but your
back reminds me of Gabe Kaplan. Um,

637
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:49,830
I had an experience with this
on a couple of occasions. Um,

638
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:54,570
under no circumstance. Um, should
you ever tell her she's Harry?

639
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:59,040
I was dating an Indian broad for awhile
and she had excessive hair growth on her

640
00:37:59,041 --> 00:38:02,970
forearms, lower back, feet and toes.

641
00:38:02,971 --> 00:38:05,340
But worst of all, nose hair,

642
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:09,360
let that he said, imagined.

643
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:13,600
Let that image sink in is
what you wanted to say. Ah,

644
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:16,200
this chick was super
cool and very attractive,

645
00:38:16,201 --> 00:38:21,201
but the hair situation was bothering
me so I broke up with her at her place,

646
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:26,760
but made the mistake of telling her why.
Oh God, dude, why would you do that?

647
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:31,320
Let it be known. This was a bad idea.
Well, no, dude, if you just told her,

648
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:35,560
you know, there was a
way you don't. Obviously,

649
00:38:35,561 --> 00:38:39,730
if you fucking listen, I'm breaking up
with you. I think you're a sweetheart,

650
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:43,360
but physically I can't deal
with all of your hair. Yeah,

651
00:38:43,361 --> 00:38:45,550
that's going to devastate her anyways.

652
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:46,760
Yeah.

653
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:50,990
Long story short, she flipped her shit
and threw plates, silverware, pots,

654
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:55,340
et Cetera at me while screaming
and crying. So I left.

655
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,460
When I came back later for my shit,

656
00:38:58,461 --> 00:39:03,410
she had thrown bleach on some of my
clothes and stapled condoms to the wall.

657
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:07,360
You could say things got hairy, lol.

658
00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:12,570
Why do women just get to just destroy
men's property all of the fucking time?

659
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:17,450
You don't like if the cops show up
and she's throwing all your shit up,

660
00:39:17,810 --> 00:39:20,990
they do a swayed.com calm down.
I start, just get in the car.

661
00:39:20,991 --> 00:39:24,950
Just get away from her sister. She calms
down. It's destruction of property.

662
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:28,140
There's like a zillion youtube videos of,

663
00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:32,180
of women just destroying their guys' cars.

664
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:36,960
I don't understand it. I really think
men should start prosecuting them.

665
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:39,530
Them them for this shit. We always
just go like, hey, yeah, dude,

666
00:39:39,531 --> 00:39:43,070
she fucking flipped out. Whatever.
I can get another flat screen.

667
00:39:43,071 --> 00:39:46,350
Just get her away from me.
I'm all in all he said, um,

668
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:51,440
if the listener hasn't told this lady
about his displeasure of her hair,

669
00:39:51,441 --> 00:39:56,000
I highly recommend he doesn't.
What do you fucking told her?

670
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:57,620
You should, should've just said, listen,

671
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:00,170
if that's the fucking reason you
were going to break up with her,

672
00:40:00,171 --> 00:40:03,960
you should not have brought
it up. What did you say?

673
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,100
Yeah. Listen. How? Yeah,
we, uh, we got to talk.

674
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:09,893
Um,

675
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:15,490
this isn't working for me. Wow.
Yeah. I'm just not happy. Well,

676
00:40:15,491 --> 00:40:19,090
what is it? Did I do something?
I said something. I said, well,

677
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:22,690
what's the problem? You're too hairy.

678
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:24,760
You have hairy toes.

679
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:29,500
You have hair above your ass and it's
coming out of your nose. And I just,

680
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:34,390
you know, you, you just reminded me
of John Matousek and I just, you know,

681
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,720
it's turned to me like why would you do
that to somebody that what you did sir,

682
00:40:37,721 --> 00:40:41,140
was fucking mean. Um, on once one,

683
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:44,720
pardon me, actually.

684
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:46,060
Okay.

685
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:50,170
Respects the fact that you
actually communicate you
and even was fucking mean is

686
00:40:50,171 --> 00:40:52,090
you're going to get what
you want in life. If you,

687
00:40:52,091 --> 00:40:55,240
if you just don't give a fuck about
other people's feelings to that level,

688
00:40:55,390 --> 00:40:57,820
you're never going to end up
trapped in a fucking relationship.

689
00:40:57,821 --> 00:41:00,310
So it's good that you do
that, but in the future, surf,

690
00:41:00,330 --> 00:41:02,980
you're going to broke at break up
with something, some something.

691
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:07,810
Somebody because of something physical.
You know it. Keep that to yourself.

692
00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:12,590
You know? Cause who's kidding who? Dude,

693
00:41:12,591 --> 00:41:14,970
that's not the only reason why
you broke up with her. You know,

694
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:19,770
if you gotta fucking tell her she was too
fucking hairy, if you still liked her,

695
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:23,010
why don't you just say, listen,
can you do me a fucking favor?

696
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:28,830
You got hairy toes. Can we start
off with that? Jesus Christ.

697
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:30,810
I'd say I'm dating a fucking cave woman.

698
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:36,320
It's 2016 have you watched
any porno in your life?

699
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,720
All right. On a side note, he said,

700
00:41:38,721 --> 00:41:41,060
you mentioned your home
gym and current workouts,

701
00:41:41,061 --> 00:41:43,640
but I've never heard you
talk about dead lifts.

702
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,400
Do you plan on doing them
and if you already do,

703
00:41:46,401 --> 00:41:50,150
what type of progress are you
making? Thanks to go flog yourself.

704
00:41:50,151 --> 00:41:51,320
What is a dead lift?

705
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:56,090
Is that the one where you fucking bend
over at the waist and pull it up or is

706
00:41:56,091 --> 00:41:58,110
that the one where you fucking Yak?

707
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:01,770
Like you're in the Olympics and
you lift it up over your head? Um,

708
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:06,330
both of those look like something I
shouldn't be doing at my age. All right.

709
00:42:06,331 --> 00:42:07,950
Videos deadlift.

710
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:09,220
Yeah.

711
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:12,460
All right. Five common
mistakes. The dead lift.

712
00:42:14,350 --> 00:42:15,590
All right, here we go.

713
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:17,053
Okay.

714
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:21,170
Oh Jesus. What is this for?
That's still, that's the one.

715
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:25,070
The old blowout your back one?
No. Have you use proper form?

716
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:28,940
Does the lifter have an Instagram?

717
00:42:29,570 --> 00:42:32,510
His hips should be the
first things that move.

718
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:37,610
There's a lot of vital information
missing from this hips.

719
00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:42,270
Hip wide stance, hands just outside
the hip. Full grip of the bar.

720
00:42:42,271 --> 00:42:46,520
Shoulders slightly in front of
the bar. Lumbar curve maintained.

721
00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:49,160
So add shoe back. Yeah. Dude,

722
00:42:49,161 --> 00:42:52,310
I'm going to give a big fuck that to
that exercise unless you can tell me what

723
00:42:52,311 --> 00:42:55,760
the hell it does to me other than increase
my chances of blowing out my back.

724
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:01,880
Um, I just kind of what for
legs? I go hiking and I do,

725
00:43:02,030 --> 00:43:05,600
I do body weight exercises, you know,

726
00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:07,190
the same way I do grip strength stuff.

727
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:09,860
I'm really into just being
able to move my fucking body.

728
00:43:09,861 --> 00:43:11,270
I don't need to pick up a car.

729
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:15,170
Like I'm grabbing it by its bumper
and try to use my fucking proper form.

730
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:19,250
But um, who knows? You know what?
I'll, I'll look those up. You know,

731
00:43:20,710 --> 00:43:23,030
I'm sure I'm going to get a big
fucking lecture on [inaudible].

732
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:25,890
Oh my goodness. You don't do dead
lifts. You might as well not be.

733
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:26,933
We're good at it up.

734
00:43:27,430 --> 00:43:30,870
All right. A deer, a bald ass. Billy Gunn,

735
00:43:32,690 --> 00:43:35,360
uh, regarding your caller.

736
00:43:35,361 --> 00:43:38,960
Who needs advice on getting his
girlfriend his shave off body here. Okay,

737
00:43:38,961 --> 00:43:41,160
here we go. I would like to tell,

738
00:43:41,690 --> 00:43:44,240
tell him to be careful what he wishes for.

739
00:43:44,690 --> 00:43:48,260
I had a girlfriend with really hairy
arms and because of it she had very low

740
00:43:48,261 --> 00:43:50,540
self esteem. Once we got to college,

741
00:43:50,541 --> 00:43:54,920
her friends took her to a beauty
salon and she had her arm hair waxed.

742
00:43:55,070 --> 00:44:00,050
Shortly after she re she started to
receive a lot of new male attention and

743
00:44:00,051 --> 00:44:02,600
pretty soon had little time from me.

744
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:07,490
Shortly after she told me she
needed to talk though. Jesus. Yeah,

745
00:44:07,491 --> 00:44:11,720
she moved up in the draft.
She had a good combine. Um,

746
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:15,530
she told me she didn't want to limit
her options in college. Good for her.

747
00:44:15,950 --> 00:44:20,120
He goes, I was devastated. I told
her that since I found her attracted,

748
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:24,680
when nobody else did that, that
should count for something. Um,

749
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:30,920
she replied with, we all make
mistakes and walked out. Jesus.

750
00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:35,280
Anyways, consider your moves carefully
before doing something brash.

751
00:44:35,550 --> 00:44:38,850
Thanks for the subpar
podcast. It go fuck yourself.

752
00:44:39,230 --> 00:44:42,450
P S take it easy on guys
writing to you for solutions.

753
00:44:42,451 --> 00:44:46,380
They are obviously at rock bottom if
they are willing to take advice from a

754
00:44:46,381 --> 00:44:51,360
dyslexic freckled, Qantas. Jason is
this guy took two shots at me. MMM,

755
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:57,330
MMM MMM wow. Yeah. That's
fucking brutal. And that's,

756
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:01,830
once again, that is something
where where it went,

757
00:45:01,831 --> 00:45:05,340
it was going the other way. Women
would be like, that's brutal.

758
00:45:05,341 --> 00:45:09,870
But then if they read this same fucking
story and as much as they dumped you,

759
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:13,170
she dumped you when you
accepted her for who you were,

760
00:45:13,470 --> 00:45:16,890
they would all be like, Woo.
That's right. You go girl,

761
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:18,680
you go get what the fuck you want

762
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:23,210
life. Um, dude,

763
00:45:23,211 --> 00:45:28,050
that's kind of fucking funny. I mean,

764
00:45:28,051 --> 00:45:32,250
does that fuck with your self
esteem at all? I think it did.

765
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:35,880
I think that's why you gave me shit.
Not once, but twice at the end of it.

766
00:45:35,881 --> 00:45:39,240
I think you got a little bit of anger,
which I would've had angered too.

767
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:46,400
Jesus Christ. Do you know what's
funny about that is like she,

768
00:45:46,430 --> 00:45:50,530
if she keeps fucking doing it and enough
time goes by the next guy who dates or

769
00:45:50,531 --> 00:45:53,570
is going to have no idea that
that's part of her fucking genetics.

770
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:56,780
And then he's going to have a
little hairy baby and be like,

771
00:45:56,781 --> 00:46:00,020
where the fuck did this come from? She
be like, Oh, you know, I don't know.

772
00:46:05,690 --> 00:46:05,850
Okay.

773
00:46:05,850 --> 00:46:08,580
Fucking baby coming out looking
like Robin Williams arms.

774
00:46:08,581 --> 00:46:12,750
Remember his fucking furry
arms rest his soul. Um,

775
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:17,670
oh my God, that's fucking everything.

776
00:46:17,671 --> 00:46:20,790
Anything happens to a guy just, it just
ends up being funny. I Dunno what it is.

777
00:46:20,791 --> 00:46:22,320
Everything that happens
to a woman is tragic,

778
00:46:22,321 --> 00:46:25,110
but just when shit happens to guys, it's
fucking funny. What are you gonna do?

779
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:28,410
You know what you're going to do buddy?
You go to the fucking gym, right?

780
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:30,600
You go to the gym and just go, you know,

781
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:34,530
just start hitting at a tip non
shit way Outta your fucking league.

782
00:46:35,370 --> 00:46:39,930
You know, do it. Do it for yourself, Ben.
She's reaching for the fucking stars.

783
00:46:39,931 --> 00:46:44,550
So should you take that as an
inspiration and a, you know,

784
00:46:45,210 --> 00:46:49,950
God help the next fucking guy. She gets
with Jesus fucking Christ. And then,

785
00:46:49,951 --> 00:46:52,920
you know, some the whole
time she walks this earth,

786
00:46:52,921 --> 00:46:55,950
she has to live with that secret.
You know, cause I'll tell you,

787
00:46:55,951 --> 00:46:59,640
there's no fucking way she's telling the
next guy that that's what's going on.

788
00:46:59,641 --> 00:47:03,120
If that held her back
right. And you, you know,

789
00:47:03,121 --> 00:47:07,320
when she walks around and hangs out with
all these other fucking beautiful women

790
00:47:07,350 --> 00:47:11,340
now in her beautiful people circle and
they have like fucking no hair on their

791
00:47:11,341 --> 00:47:14,520
arms, there's going to be something
in the back of her head. You know,

792
00:47:15,130 --> 00:47:18,450
at one day she'll have too many white
zinfandels and she'll just say to her,

793
00:47:18,451 --> 00:47:19,440
fucking boyfriend,

794
00:47:19,790 --> 00:47:20,670
you're a good guy. You

795
00:47:21,270 --> 00:47:24,540
maybe she won't. Maybe she won't. Then
some day they have the hairy baby,

796
00:47:24,930 --> 00:47:27,690
the OAH beef, the dreaded hairy baby.

797
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:31,660
I can't come into work
today. Oh, it's a matter a,

798
00:47:31,661 --> 00:47:35,980
my wife gave birth to a heavy baby.
Yeah, dude, it's fucking ridiculous.

799
00:47:35,981 --> 00:47:38,260
I thought it was a, I thought
it was a little gorilla.

800
00:47:43,670 --> 00:47:44,503
Oh, okay.

801
00:47:44,550 --> 00:47:48,880
Turns out she had fucking hair all
over. She just got waxed. All right,

802
00:47:49,190 --> 00:47:54,000
dear red, red Sonia. I don't know what
that means. I hope I said Sonjia. S O n.

803
00:47:54,001 --> 00:47:58,530
J a. Um, should I look
that one up? I mean,

804
00:47:58,531 --> 00:48:02,010
if it's an insult, I got to see what
it is I want to share on the laugh.

805
00:48:02,070 --> 00:48:04,290
Other than the fact I can't
pronounce it or know what it is.

806
00:48:07,710 --> 00:48:08,543
Red Sonja, what is red?

807
00:48:09,490 --> 00:48:14,490
Sonya Red Sonja in 1985 is a vengeful
woman sets out to achieve a magic orb with

808
00:48:15,421 --> 00:48:17,130
an er. I got to see images of this.

809
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:18,713
Okay.

810
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:24,330
Jesus Christ. He's fucking smoking
hot. Um, I don't know what that means,

811
00:48:24,331 --> 00:48:26,760
but anyways, dear red, Sonya, um, her,

812
00:48:26,761 --> 00:48:30,450
the email from the guy with the
Harry Brazilian girls is another one.

813
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:32,630
Okay.

814
00:48:32,630 --> 00:48:36,530
This is another one. There's
a lot of hairy ladies. Um,

815
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:40,050
I have a suggestion for the
other guys in similar situations.

816
00:48:42,050 --> 00:48:42,883
Um,

817
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:44,940
have bill burr address it for you.

818
00:48:44,970 --> 00:48:48,930
Listen to the podcast over the speakers
when your girl is home. That way,

819
00:48:48,990 --> 00:48:53,460
you'll plant a seed in her brain and
hopefully get her to shave with Anne Wax

820
00:48:53,461 --> 00:48:55,950
without even addressing it yourself. Oh,

821
00:48:55,951 --> 00:49:00,951
so play that fucking part of the
podcast when they're around a,

822
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:03,930
you know what? Women are
way more complex than that.

823
00:49:03,931 --> 00:49:08,900
That's a fucking decent idea. And uh,
cause what's going to happen, she'll,

824
00:49:08,930 --> 00:49:11,720
if she's self conscious about
that, if the light goes off,

825
00:49:11,721 --> 00:49:15,560
she's going to be like, that's first.
She'll be like, that's stupid, Eh,

826
00:49:15,561 --> 00:49:17,360
that guy shouldn't have blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

827
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:19,540
And then about a half hour, that bullshit,

828
00:49:19,730 --> 00:49:23,480
you'll finally come around to saying
like, do you think there's like,

829
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:28,620
I know I'm a little more hairier
than most girls. Does it bother you?

830
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:30,390
It's still gonna come back to you.

831
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:34,950
If women were that fucking
easy to deal with emotionally,

832
00:49:34,951 --> 00:49:37,110
we wouldn't die eight years before them.

833
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:40,110
There's no fucking way
it would be that easy.

834
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:42,750
Like they're just going to listen to
the podcast and they just going to click

835
00:49:42,751 --> 00:49:45,660
and be like, oh wow, maybe I should wax.

836
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:50,040
I'm going to do that and
not have a fucking four hour
un meeting with my fucking

837
00:49:50,041 --> 00:49:52,140
boyfriend. Um, anyways, he said,

838
00:49:52,141 --> 00:49:55,770
I've done the same thing in the past with
great success. Okay, maybe I'm wrong.

839
00:49:55,800 --> 00:50:00,660
Wait a minute. Wait A, here's the
replay going over to the replay booth.

840
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:05,670
A I happened to listen to
an app episode. He said,

841
00:50:05,671 --> 00:50:09,360
I happened in quotes to listen to an
episode about lip hair when we were

842
00:50:09,361 --> 00:50:14,100
driving. Three days later,
mustache was gone. Try it.

843
00:50:14,101 --> 00:50:18,780
It just might work. Holy
Shit. All right, well fuck it.

844
00:50:18,930 --> 00:50:21,510
Give it a shot. I stand
corrected. I Apologize Sir.

845
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:27,590
I apologize. Apologize. Jesus
Christ. I just pictured the, uh,

846
00:50:29,030 --> 00:50:31,910
the referee coming back saying no goal,

847
00:50:32,270 --> 00:50:34,370
but he actually came back
and said the goal was aloud.

848
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:38,510
You lost sight of the puck and the
mustache still left. It's incredible.

849
00:50:39,170 --> 00:50:43,280
Alright. All the best from Sweden.
Okay. What am I up to here?

850
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:47,810
50 fucking minutes. Alright. Okay.

851
00:50:47,811 --> 00:50:52,130
Career crossroads. Hey Billy, fuck
face. I liked that guy. He just,

852
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:54,140
he didn't try to be creative.
He just went right for it.

853
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:57,980
I am a 17 year old high school senior,

854
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:01,130
going to into college, studying pre law.

855
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:04,250
And ever since I was young I
wanted to go into the military.

856
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:08,900
My father owns a medical compliance
company and his promised me a job after

857
00:51:08,901 --> 00:51:13,790
college. Should I get a law degree?
However, he was re a Jesus Christ.

858
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:15,650
You know what? I just realized
I've got to do something. Hang on.

859
00:51:15,651 --> 00:51:16,580
I gotta start this. Fuck.

860
00:51:16,610 --> 00:51:19,760
I got to hit pause and I got to start
this fucking question over again.

861
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:23,240
I gotta unlock the door here.
Hang on. All right, I'm back.

862
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:25,400
I didn't need to unlock
the door. She had her keys.

863
00:51:25,401 --> 00:51:27,340
For some reason I didn't
think she had her keys. Um,

864
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:29,960
and she needed the lovely Nia is going
to come on hopefully in a minute and

865
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:34,280
dress the fucking, the growing
controversy of the hairy girlfriend.

866
00:51:34,281 --> 00:51:38,840
How do you tell her? All right. So
here we go. Hey Billy. Hey Billy.

867
00:51:38,841 --> 00:51:42,470
Fuck face. Uh, I am a 17
year old high school senior,

868
00:51:42,950 --> 00:51:45,500
going into college, studying prelaw.

869
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:49,340
And ever since I was young I
wanted to go into the military.

870
00:51:51,170 --> 00:51:53,720
Um, my father owns a
medical compliance company,

871
00:51:53,721 --> 00:51:57,680
has promised me a job after
college. Should I get a law degree?

872
00:51:58,910 --> 00:52:02,240
Why would you get a law degree and then
working in a medical compliance company

873
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:05,690
or medical? I thought I was thinking
like they supplied like appliances,

874
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:09,080
like he was selling like fucking
dental drills and shit. However,

875
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:13,160
he has recently talked about selling the
company and retiring as he is nearing

876
00:52:13,161 --> 00:52:17,720
70 and not getting any
younger. My question is this,

877
00:52:17,721 --> 00:52:18,830
after I finished college,

878
00:52:18,831 --> 00:52:22,430
should I enlist in the military something
that I've wanted as long as I can

879
00:52:22,431 --> 00:52:24,740
remember or should I stick
with the safer option?

880
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:29,980
Never choose safe taking over my
father's business slash securing a safe

881
00:52:31,731 --> 00:52:34,160
lifelong career. Now do that.

882
00:52:34,161 --> 00:52:38,510
That is a recipe for what if, um,

883
00:52:38,750 --> 00:52:43,610
fuck that dude. You're young. You don't
have any kids. Just risk, risk, risk,

884
00:52:43,611 --> 00:52:47,360
risk, risk. I'm not saying fucking jump
off a bridge here. I'm just saying,

885
00:52:47,870 --> 00:52:50,570
yeah, go big. You go
big when you're young.

886
00:52:51,650 --> 00:52:56,450
You know she never go out with me. Fucking
ask her out. Who gives a fuck? Right?

887
00:52:56,900 --> 00:53:00,440
Oh my God, I can't, I can't try to do
that. That's a one in a zillion chance.

888
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:01,790
Just go fucking do it.

889
00:53:02,210 --> 00:53:07,070
Listen to how I read out loud
how fucking horrific I am,

890
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:12,220
and I've been tremendously successful
telling shit jokes now if I can do it,

891
00:53:12,351 --> 00:53:15,950
believe me, anybody can do it. And you
can too. If that's what you want to do,

892
00:53:15,951 --> 00:53:19,370
you should definitely do
it. Um, anyways, he said,

893
00:53:19,371 --> 00:53:22,520
I'm worried that during my
absence in the military,

894
00:53:22,521 --> 00:53:27,060
there's a strong possibility my father
will say it and sell the business.

895
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:29,130
I'm at a loss because on one hand,

896
00:53:29,131 --> 00:53:32,490
I don't want to sit at a desk 10 years
from now thinking about what could have

897
00:53:32,491 --> 00:53:35,610
been a great experience in the
military. But on the other hand,

898
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:37,170
I don't want to lose a job at my,

899
00:53:37,950 --> 00:53:42,950
at my fathers and be stuck at a soul
sucking law firm for 30 years in a tiny

900
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:46,380
cubicle working to make
someone else's dream come true.

901
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:49,830
I'm really at a crossroads here and I
don't want to make the wrong choice that

902
00:53:49,831 --> 00:53:52,580
could potentially fuck
me over big time. Uh,

903
00:53:52,670 --> 00:53:55,640
what would you do if you were my shoes?
Thank you. And Go fuck yourself. Uh,

904
00:53:55,641 --> 00:53:58,170
I would go into the military.
I'd finished your law degree.

905
00:53:58,530 --> 00:54:00,930
That's what you want to do.
I would go into the military,

906
00:54:00,931 --> 00:54:02,940
join the branch that you wanted to.

907
00:54:03,090 --> 00:54:06,720
I would fucking crush it in the
military and then when I come out,

908
00:54:06,870 --> 00:54:11,070
I would be such, you know, I would
attack being a lawyer at the same,

909
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:16,290
the same attitude. Why do you feel like
you're going to be stuck in a tiny,

910
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:18,780
tiny cubicle? Why wouldn't you
move up and become partner?

911
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:22,980
You need to dream bigger dreams. Dude.
This whole thing of like, you know,

912
00:54:22,981 --> 00:54:26,190
the only way you're going to be successful
in the business world as if you take

913
00:54:26,191 --> 00:54:29,700
a job for your dad. Fuck that
dude. If you go the other route,

914
00:54:29,701 --> 00:54:32,760
you become a self made man. And
when you become a self made man,

915
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:37,050
you get a belief and a
confidence in yourself and um,

916
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:42,810
you don't worry. Like you're 17, you're
already, you're already worrying.

917
00:54:42,811 --> 00:54:45,180
Fuck that. You got your
whole life ahead of you.

918
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:50,160
I would go out and do everything that
you want to do. And then one day,

919
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:54,480
all 20 years goes by and all of
a sudden you're like, Holy Shit,

920
00:54:54,481 --> 00:54:56,850
I work for myself. I'm making great money.

921
00:54:57,300 --> 00:55:01,620
I can go to the movies whenever I want
to. I can take a vacation. You know,

922
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:04,860
I could talk shit on a podcast.

923
00:55:04,861 --> 00:55:09,480
Like it just completely opens the
world, opens up for you. But you know,

924
00:55:09,481 --> 00:55:12,720
if you'd go the safe route,
you know, there's that,

925
00:55:12,721 --> 00:55:16,600
there's that does that fucking knowing
that haunting voice in the back of the

926
00:55:16,601 --> 00:55:20,270
head. What if I did this? What if I
did that? He starts sleeping at night.

927
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:23,580
All right. All right. All right.
Fucking thrashing and Shit. Um,

928
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:27,210
I think you're going to do great in the
military and I think you'd do great as a

929
00:55:27,211 --> 00:55:30,930
lawyer. And that's what you should
be thinking. You know, that's it.

930
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:34,830
And you're gonna meet some
fucking beautiful woman and she,

931
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:36,990
you get married or whatever,
whatever the fuck is you want to do.

932
00:55:36,991 --> 00:55:39,750
Just think positive thoughts and uh,

933
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:41,910
surround yourself with
people that feel that way.

934
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:45,840
And if you have a friend that sees
you start to do well and you feel them

935
00:55:45,841 --> 00:55:48,180
starting to become negative, address it.

936
00:55:48,181 --> 00:55:50,310
And if they don't fucking
clean up their shit,

937
00:55:50,311 --> 00:55:53,550
you cut them out of your life cause
those people will bring you down.

938
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:58,740
Stay here at the townie bar
with the old football jacket on.

939
00:55:59,010 --> 00:56:01,500
Fuck that. All right. Good
luck to you sir. Alright.

940
00:56:01,530 --> 00:56:05,910
Dating an older lady and all
the broad, hey Billy boy.

941
00:56:05,911 --> 00:56:10,710
Fuck nut. Uh, Ben in a serious
relationship with an older woman.

942
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:13,860
She is fantastic. Cooks
for me, rubs my feet,

943
00:56:13,861 --> 00:56:17,400
gives me sponge baths
and just an absolute gem.

944
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:21,180
She has a great job,
makes a boatload of uh,

945
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:27,100
cash I guess. S Carol, E. S. C. A. R.
O. L. E. I don't want to say that word.

946
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:30,730
And I also do very well for
myself. Money is not an issue.

947
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:32,530
I deeply care for her and love her.

948
00:56:32,531 --> 00:56:36,490
I'm 30 and she is 45 but she looks
better than most girls my age.

949
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:38,920
When we first met, I thought she was 32.

950
00:56:39,070 --> 00:56:41,050
So that's what initially
attracted me to her.

951
00:56:41,260 --> 00:56:46,260
She's fucking slamming hot and a great
purse and it has a great personality.

952
00:56:46,630 --> 00:56:50,260
We can joke around and I
can say disturbing things
to her and she just laughs.

953
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:52,760
Real class act type of broad. Uh,

954
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:57,450
she was an 18 year old daughter. She
has an 18 year old daughter bird.

955
00:56:57,460 --> 00:56:59,950
As far as I'm concerned. I
don't really give a flying fuck.

956
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:04,870
My family had some opinions and we're
like, she's too old, blah blah blah.

957
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:07,120
Fuck them. They have
miserable relationships.

958
00:57:07,330 --> 00:57:12,250
She makes me a better person and I feel
good. Your thoughts, uh, your thoughts,

959
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:16,120
Billy Little sack Jesus
Christ. Fucking everybody.

960
00:57:16,121 --> 00:57:19,540
They gave me the old
fucking one, two there. Um,

961
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:21,240
okay.

962
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:24,450
Well Dude, you sound like you're happy.
That's what the fuck you want. The what?

963
00:57:24,451 --> 00:57:27,780
There's nothing wrong with
it. That's what you want.

964
00:57:27,781 --> 00:57:31,740
There's nothing fucking wrong with it.
She makes you happy. Yeah, absolutely.

965
00:57:31,770 --> 00:57:34,020
Why would you leave?
You know, I don't know.

966
00:57:34,021 --> 00:57:37,890
If you want to have kids that might,
that would be a fucking issue. You know,

967
00:57:37,891 --> 00:57:41,340
at that point you freeze her fucking
eggs and you jerk off into something.

968
00:57:41,341 --> 00:57:45,070
I don't know how it works. I
don't pretend to be a doctor. Um,

969
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:47,160
I'll fuck you know what? I
didn't read the other Goddamn,

970
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:49,280
okay.

971
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:50,590

you to believe it's your only option.

978

00:58:13,891 --> 00:58:15,260
their longterm contracts.

980
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:19,410
You get stuck writing huge checks
month after month with no way out.

981
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:22,350
It's robbery by contract and
it can cost you thousands,

but there's a better way to protect your

Okay. All right. Well that's
the end of the podcast,

1044
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:11,090
but she's going to come here in the
end and we're gonna uh, I dunno.

1045
01:02:11,150 --> 01:02:15,110
A little bonus, like five minute thing
here. This could go south very easily,

1046
01:02:15,111 --> 01:02:20,010
but we'll see what happens. Hang on,
let me hit plus. Right? The lovely knee.

1047
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:24,180
Everybody. Hi, how are you? I'm great,
thanks. Okay, let's get right down to it.

1048
01:02:24,330 --> 01:02:29,190
Okay. All right. This guy, he's dating
this woman. She thinks she's beautiful,

1049
01:02:29,460 --> 01:02:34,110
but she's Harry this
thing again. Well, yeah,

1050
01:02:34,111 --> 01:02:37,710
but I never, you never talked to about,
we never got a females advice on this.

1051
01:02:37,980 --> 01:02:40,950
I thought we did. You
talked about it. Yeah,

1052
01:02:40,951 --> 01:02:45,951
I remember I said like either like
he sort of gets something wags,

1053
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:48,660
then they go together and it's
funny or he just like gets over it.

1054
01:02:49,290 --> 01:02:53,850
You said that on the podcast or
did we talk about that on our own?

1055
01:02:53,970 --> 01:02:58,620
Not on the podcast. And you got all mad
at me cause I was like, if she's not,

1056
01:02:58,650 --> 01:03:01,830
what do you have against talking
into the mic? I don't know.

1057
01:03:01,860 --> 01:03:06,860
You just sit there and go like I know
people tweeted me the last time was like I

1058
01:03:07,051 --> 01:03:11,420
can't hear you. So I, you've
told me just to the Mike,

1059
01:03:11,430 --> 01:03:13,950
just have it follow your,
your, your mouth. Okay.

1060
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:18,390
But because the thing is I feel like
if a microphone is anywhere near me,

1061
01:03:18,391 --> 01:03:23,230
it's going to microphone
my voice. So amplify.

1062
01:03:25,150 --> 01:03:25,983
Wow.

1063
01:03:27,260 --> 01:03:30,660
It's very rare that someone
makes me look like the smart one.

1064
01:03:31,950 --> 01:03:35,490
Microphone. My voice. So, um,
well what you have to know is with

1065
01:03:37,110 --> 01:03:39,330
microphones, each one of them they have,

1066
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:43,650
there's ones that are designed to pick
up three 60. There's ones that are like,

1067
01:03:43,651 --> 01:03:48,000
these ones are like directly on.
Okay. So that fits directly on that.

1068
01:03:48,030 --> 01:03:51,420
The reason for that is if there's other
background noise that you don't want to

1069
01:03:51,421 --> 01:03:52,081
pick that up.

1070
01:03:52,081 --> 01:03:54,780
There's other microphones designed
where you want to hear the whole room.

1071
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:57,480
These are directly on, so
you've got to speak into it,

1072
01:03:57,481 --> 01:04:00,450
but this is not what we're talking about.
Okay. Sorry. All right, so somebody,

1073
01:04:00,980 --> 01:04:05,790
somebody got this and she's got
like a like hair on her lower back.

1074
01:04:06,030 --> 01:04:08,640
Yeah. Like right with a
tramp stamp would be like,

1075
01:04:08,700 --> 01:04:12,320
she could have a tramp stamp and he
wouldn't know cause it's, there's a,

1076
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:16,440
the whole thicket of hair under that.
Yeah. I thought we talked about this.

1077
01:04:16,441 --> 01:04:18,960
I thought you stopped saying that. Okay.

1078
01:04:19,020 --> 01:04:21,330
I understand that you think
that we talked about it.

1079
01:04:21,420 --> 01:04:24,210
Neither one of us can remember if we
did it on the podcast and this is just

1080
01:04:24,211 --> 01:04:27,930
bonus time anyways, so
refresh our listeners. Well,

1081
01:04:27,931 --> 01:04:32,490
my dating a woman, she's got a fucking
Afro right above her butt crack.

1082
01:04:32,491 --> 01:04:36,480
What do you say something wrong
with an Afro? Um, a on your head.

1083
01:04:38,220 --> 01:04:42,900
A booboo. I think you
have some answer though.

1084
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:45,480
God Damn, this is just,
this is just a tough one.

1085
01:04:45,481 --> 01:04:48,060
How long has he been dating
this person? It can he be like,

1086
01:04:48,061 --> 01:04:50,370
so what's with your little
furry back over here?

1087
01:04:50,371 --> 01:04:55,290
You're like my little Chia pet in a cute
way. Like, can he say it in a cute way?

1088
01:04:55,380 --> 01:04:59,700
How do you say that in a cute
way. I Dunno. Like say, Oh,

1089
01:04:59,850 --> 01:05:04,370
you're my little Chia pet back here. No.

1090
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:10,080
Um, you know what? Maybe
he could just sort of like,

1091
01:05:10,530 --> 01:05:12,390
this is gonna sound really fucking weird,

1092
01:05:12,570 --> 01:05:16,620
but maybe the sort of like stroke
it or whatever the thing is.

1093
01:05:16,621 --> 01:05:18,910
She'll probably be like, oh
God no, don't touch that.

1094
01:05:18,911 --> 01:05:22,330
I know there's like hair back there.
It's so like weird. I hate it.

1095
01:05:22,331 --> 01:05:25,510
And he can go, why don't you get it wax?
And she might be like, I don't know.

1096
01:05:25,511 --> 01:05:28,660
Like I'm embarrassed. I'll go with
you. I'll walk something with you.

1097
01:05:28,690 --> 01:05:32,350
How about that? I'll wax something.
You ask something and then boom,

1098
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:35,310
I have an idea to what,

1099
01:05:35,730 --> 01:05:39,820
how about when you know she's wearing
like a sexy shirt so it doesn't quite

1100
01:05:39,821 --> 01:05:42,970
reach down to her pants when she goes
to get up off the probably doesn't wear

1101
01:05:42,971 --> 01:05:45,670
shirts like that. When she
goes to get up off the couch.

1102
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:49,480
You just reach up and grab her a
little backhand. Go back down here.

1103
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:52,990
What did you sign on her stomach?

1104
01:05:52,991 --> 01:05:57,550
At the beach and he starts braiding
it for her. I know it's bad, it's bad.

1105
01:05:57,551 --> 01:05:59,460
It's cause your questionable situation.

1106
01:06:00,210 --> 01:06:01,960
Well this one guy was saying
he was dating this woman,

1107
01:06:01,961 --> 01:06:06,370
she had like even hairy feet. She had
like hairy toes. Shit happens man.

1108
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,700
I know, but what the fuck
N***a you gotta handle that?

1109
01:06:10,510 --> 01:06:14,830
I mean ideally yes you would handle that
in a perfect world, in a perfect world.

1110
01:06:14,980 --> 01:06:15,431
But you know,

1111
01:06:15,431 --> 01:06:20,200
I had girlfriends for years who had a
little like just like the little shade of

1112
01:06:20,201 --> 01:06:22,210
a mustache and they just never,

1113
01:06:22,570 --> 01:06:25,690
it just never really occurred to
them to wax it until like recently.

1114
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:26,830
And I remember I had a friend,

1115
01:06:26,831 --> 01:06:28,720
I saw her I hadn't seen in
awhile and she was like,

1116
01:06:28,721 --> 01:06:29,950
do you notice anything different?

1117
01:06:30,100 --> 01:06:32,830
And she kept turning her face in a
certain way and I was like, yeah,

1118
01:06:32,850 --> 01:06:36,850
you get your upper lip wax. I was
like, yes. Yeah. She was like,

1119
01:06:36,851 --> 01:06:38,980
I finally did it. She
was like, I don't know.

1120
01:06:38,981 --> 01:06:42,250
I was always just intimidated to
go into the place. And she's like,

1121
01:06:42,251 --> 01:06:44,860
but I'm so glad I did. So I have
to, is that what it is? Yeah.

1122
01:06:44,861 --> 01:06:48,280
People are self conscious and you
think you'll go in there and you'll get

1123
01:06:48,790 --> 01:06:51,400
judgement by the waxing person,
but the waxing person has waxed,

1124
01:06:51,820 --> 01:06:55,780
you know Chewbacca down there so
they don't care. That's their job.

1125
01:06:56,650 --> 01:07:00,160
So it could be that she's just like a
little embarrassed to go to a place and

1126
01:07:00,161 --> 01:07:02,680
have it taken off because
who wants to say, oh,

1127
01:07:02,681 --> 01:07:07,210
I have to go get my back wax today before
you don't have to say that you just

1128
01:07:07,470 --> 01:07:10,510
walked down and you go,
Hey, can you wax my back?

1129
01:07:11,590 --> 01:07:14,710
You don't even have to whisper
it. I know you don't. So, oh no.

1130
01:07:14,711 --> 01:07:18,270
But if you go there to other people, see
you getting your back wax? No, no, no,

1131
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:21,700
no. You're in a private room. Oh, whenever
you get any kind of waxing service,

1132
01:07:21,701 --> 01:07:26,290
it's not like Steve Ferrell
Clarkson. Exactly. Yeah.

1133
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:29,260
So you are going to private things.
So he just has to do it in a cute,

1134
01:07:29,261 --> 01:07:31,960
you know what, this one
asshole did what? He goes,

1135
01:07:31,961 --> 01:07:36,850
I suggest you don't tell the woman
that she's hairy. He told the woman,

1136
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:41,140
he broke up with her and said the reason
why he was doing it was because she was

1137
01:07:41,141 --> 01:07:43,870
so hairy is that's not the way this do.

1138
01:07:43,871 --> 01:07:47,290
Isn't that the meanest thing you've
ever fucking mean his thing ever.

1139
01:07:48,370 --> 01:07:51,160
Are you that shallow? Because that's
something that's easily fixable.

1140
01:07:51,161 --> 01:07:53,650
Are you that fucking shallow
that you break up with someone?

1141
01:07:53,770 --> 01:07:54,880
It's like cause your hair your back.

1142
01:07:54,881 --> 01:07:59,881
Like what a fucking ass hole back feet
knows a lot of coming out of the nose and

1143
01:08:00,191 --> 01:08:03,280
then the arms. That's
just, that's unnecessary.

1144
01:08:03,360 --> 01:08:06,580
It to to say that after the
fact if you love somebody,

1145
01:08:07,330 --> 01:08:09,790
even if you don't, even if
you don't love somebody,

1146
01:08:09,791 --> 01:08:12,580
you don't do that to somebody. Yeah.
No that's not, that's not okay.

1147
01:08:12,820 --> 01:08:15,010
But then show, since she fucking, he came,

1148
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:17,870
she started throwing plates and he
fucking left and they came back.

1149
01:08:17,970 --> 01:08:22,010
She had dumped bleach on his clothes
and stapled some condoms to the fucking

1150
01:08:22,011 --> 01:08:26,480
wall. The usual destruction of property
that for some reason do use validated.

1151
01:08:27,110 --> 01:08:27,943
Do you have?

1152
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:33,200
I have never actually noticed you have
back here yet but I mean back here yet

1153
01:08:33,790 --> 01:08:35,720
like cause I go that
something has and all the,

1154
01:08:35,900 --> 01:08:39,490
I've actually never not turned around.
Now I don't have back here. Let me say,

1155
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:44,860
well Jesus Christ near your fucking
sleep next to me every goddamn day.

1156
01:08:44,861 --> 01:08:47,960
I just never thought to look for
that. Now I don't have back here.

1157
01:08:49,640 --> 01:08:54,640
There is a very fine little area
in the lower back tramp stamp area.

1158
01:08:55,731 --> 01:08:59,270
Not a lot. You can barely see
it cause your hair so fair.

1159
01:08:59,890 --> 01:09:01,640
But like no, no, no.

1160
01:09:01,700 --> 01:09:05,540
You have a very small like yeah
that got nothing back there.

1161
01:09:05,541 --> 01:09:06,920
There's nothing back there.

1162
01:09:07,100 --> 01:09:09,920
I mean there's more on your chest
than on the your lower back.

1163
01:09:10,010 --> 01:09:12,710
Very small amount. But the thing is,

1164
01:09:12,711 --> 01:09:16,130
I feel like in 10 years that
shit could get a little thin.

1165
01:09:16,440 --> 01:09:20,480
In 10 years I'm going to be close to
60 I mean I'd still have you accident.

1166
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:22,660
What? In 10 years? What?

1167
01:09:22,820 --> 01:09:26,210
Where my white fucking back
here against my white back.

1168
01:09:27,560 --> 01:09:30,890
Cause it bothers you when I wear a
fucking half shirts. I mean, what,

1169
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:36,620
what are we doing at that point? That's
a fair way to look at my lower back.

1170
01:09:36,710 --> 01:09:41,210
Let's just do, let's just, no, you don't.
No, you don't know. Okay. You don't,

1171
01:09:41,340 --> 01:09:44,870
well I'm, I'm, yeah, I try to keep
very familiar with your lower back.

1172
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:49,430
You don't, Oh yeah, you don't,
you're not a hairy person

1173
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:54,890
so, but if I was hairy back there,
would you say something to me?

1174
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:56,480
Nudge when I broke up with you?

1175
01:09:57,050 --> 01:10:01,370
What's so you would have broken up over
cause I want to take in the time to fall

1176
01:10:01,371 --> 01:10:02,204
in love with you.

1177
01:10:02,270 --> 01:10:06,200
If you walking around looking like
fucking Burt Reynolds and playgirl.

1178
01:10:07,940 --> 01:10:12,470
Okay. Oh, I see a Photoshop coming.

1179
01:10:12,530 --> 01:10:16,880
Oh my God. That man. No,
that man, wait, shout out to

1180
01:10:18,470 --> 01:10:19,970
the MM Photoshop on
sweater. Oh my God, Dude.

1181
01:10:19,971 --> 01:10:23,150
That one with me standing
in front of the fountain.

1182
01:10:24,530 --> 01:10:25,880
I fucking, dude,

1183
01:10:25,940 --> 01:10:30,530
we were in the writer's room when I
saw that and I fucking laughed so hard.

1184
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:33,590
Yeah. Like one of the other
riders was going like, what? What?

1185
01:10:33,591 --> 01:10:36,380
And I showed it to him and everyone was
going like, oh my God, that's so mean.

1186
01:10:36,381 --> 01:10:37,550
I go, that's fucking hilarious.

1187
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:41,540
And then I love the picture of
you that they found it was, yeah,

1188
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:43,460
it was like when you were
going out to some event.

1189
01:10:43,461 --> 01:10:47,690
So you look at the heat premiere.
Yeah, that's what that picture was.

1190
01:10:47,691 --> 01:10:50,270
I was trying to be like, fucking,
you know, modest about it.

1191
01:10:50,271 --> 01:10:52,100
I didn't want to sit there and
say, you were in a movie premier.

1192
01:10:52,101 --> 01:10:55,250
I said you had some big event. You
always gotta just be standing there.

1193
01:10:55,251 --> 01:10:57,500
You always have to fucking
drop the Hollywood shit.

1194
01:10:57,501 --> 01:11:02,501
Don't Juliet on taxi premiere
for the cinematic film.

1195
01:11:03,081 --> 01:11:07,960
The heat where my husband had two
lines. You had more than two lines. Oh,

1196
01:11:08,030 --> 01:11:09,860
if you sneezed in that
movie, you missed me.

1197
01:11:13,170 --> 01:11:17,640
But now everybody's follow
the MM Photoshop on sweater.
Yeah. Whoever that is,

1198
01:11:17,641 --> 01:11:20,400
man. A woman is fucking
hilarious. Wait, wait, wait.

1199
01:11:20,401 --> 01:11:24,660
Actually I'm a better one for that,
ma'am. Photoshop. All right, so wait,

1200
01:11:24,661 --> 01:11:26,970
where's my phone? Because I wrote it down.

1201
01:11:26,971 --> 01:11:29,760
Remember you said the name of
a movie and it was once again,

1202
01:11:29,761 --> 01:11:34,761
how you have just sort of clues from the
movie and I don't remember the titles.

1203
01:11:35,710 --> 01:11:36,031
All right,

1204
01:11:36,031 --> 01:11:39,420
so I'm going to find it because it was
definitely one of your classic ones.

1205
01:11:39,421 --> 01:11:42,390
And we're not going to
say what the movie is.

1206
01:11:42,690 --> 01:11:45,570
We're just going to have the m Photoshop.

1207
01:11:47,020 --> 01:11:47,360
Okay,

1208
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:50,210
wait, let me see if I
can find it. Mark it up,

1209
01:11:50,211 --> 01:11:54,950
put it on Twitter and then everyone will
be able to guess, hopefully. All right,

1210
01:11:54,951 --> 01:11:59,470
so you called this movie. I'm going to
kill you on Wall Street. They're fuck,

1211
01:11:59,471 --> 01:12:04,440
oh, I'm going to kill you on
Wall Street. They're Fucko.

1212
01:12:05,230 --> 01:12:08,420
So that's, that's it. That
was a movie. That's a movie.

1213
01:12:08,630 --> 01:12:12,050
So people are gonna try to guess what
it is. Mm, Photoshop is going to it.

1214
01:12:12,170 --> 01:12:15,380
It's funny. Days later, movie
poster. Days later. You reading that?

1215
01:12:15,381 --> 01:12:18,920
It now sounds like somebody else says
it, said it, and it's a terrible clue.

1216
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:23,660
That's not even close. It's sort
of close. They'll figure it out.

1217
01:12:24,740 --> 01:12:25,640
All right, well,

1218
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:27,850
okay,

1219
01:12:27,850 --> 01:12:30,850
it's uh, 12 minutes past the hour here.

1220
01:12:30,940 --> 01:12:35,890
It's time to wrap this up because open
is past the hour, hour and WB. You are.

1221
01:12:35,891 --> 01:12:40,030
Our morning becomes eclectic. I
love her. You listened to that.

1222
01:12:40,031 --> 01:12:43,070
You think it makes you smarter?
All right. That's it. No,

1223
01:12:43,220 --> 01:12:46,690
it's so pretentious to
be smart. Okay. KCRW,

1224
01:12:47,190 --> 01:12:50,770
so you get a variety of musical
style. Same liberal viewpoint.

1225
01:12:52,110 --> 01:12:55,570
All right. You done this over.

1226
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:58,720
Can I just know I go somewhere to eat?
My hope miracle. You know what it is.

1227
01:12:58,780 --> 01:13:00,370
I just, I don't like shit.

1228
01:13:00,371 --> 01:13:04,060
That's a hundred percent liberal are 100%
conservative. All right. That's fine.

1229
01:13:04,090 --> 01:13:07,390
I like in the middle because both
of them caused me to yell at them.

1230
01:13:08,980 --> 01:13:11,050
Bill, I always yell at everything.

1231
01:13:11,051 --> 01:13:15,070
It doesn't matter what it is because
nothing is exactly your viewpoint.

1232
01:13:15,100 --> 01:13:19,510
I don't yell at you. What? I don't
yell at the dog. That's also not true.

1233
01:13:19,511 --> 01:13:23,730
I don't yell at other drivers.
I'm courteous. I'm polite.

1234
01:13:24,190 --> 01:13:25,023
Okay.

1235
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:28,800
I don't yell at inanimate
objects like my computer.

1236
01:13:28,801 --> 01:13:31,250
I don't do any of those things.
Sure. Well then all right then.

1237
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:33,990
Then I want to know, you're
like a red headed Gandhi.

1238
01:13:36,660 --> 01:13:41,550
I definitely was like Ben Kingsley's
more than I look like fucking Donny.

1239
01:13:42,370 --> 01:13:46,320
Danny Bonaduce. All right. That's the
A, that's the podcast here for the, uh,

1240
01:13:46,350 --> 01:13:49,440
for this Monday. Anybody to
do, Jenny bought a doge shake.

1241
01:13:50,190 --> 01:13:53,630
He got a situation with anybody do it.
But dude, we got to take them care.

1242
01:13:53,650 --> 01:13:57,450
The fucking, all right, that's it. I'll
talk to you. Fuck hours on Thursday.

1243
01:13:57,480 --> 01:13:58,320
Go fuck yourselves.
