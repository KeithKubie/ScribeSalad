1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,610
So as much as possible,

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:07,640
it's usually four fights a year and
then as you get better it drops to three

3
00:00:08,311 --> 00:00:13,170
fights. And then when you're the champion
that drops the two fights. So, um, that's,

4
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:16,320
that's the progression of fault of
fighting. You can't, like for instance,

5
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:20,180
how many fights did the anti
have this year? Maybe two.

6
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:25,510
It before, when you start it now he
would have like three to four. Yeah.

7
00:00:25,511 --> 00:00:29,080
He's very angry that this rematch is
not happening. And I side with him,

8
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:33,390
it was a Tyson and pulled out Tyson
got a deal with ESPN. Yeah. Yeah. Well,

9
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:39,570
and it's, it's a, it's a big deal because
I, you know, talking about chess match,

10
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,290
I think that's, he's pulled off the
greatest chess match move there is

11
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:47,400
first he comes over from England.
He wouldn't,

12
00:00:47,401 --> 00:00:50,880
he takes the challenge if we Deontae uh,
Joshua didn't,

13
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,820
he boxed had a great fight.

14
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:57,960
Now he's put himself right up with all,

15
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:02,460
all three of them are on the same line
to me. And then now for the rematch,

16
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:04,020
they want to,

17
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:07,260
people want to see Deontae and they
want to see Tyson fury again because the

18
00:01:07,261 --> 00:01:11,190
first fight was exciting. Uh, Joshua,

19
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,030
who's he fighting?
You know he's going to fight the big baby,

20
00:01:15,031 --> 00:01:18,290
but nobody knows him.
Everybody knows Deontae boxing fans.

21
00:01:18,291 --> 00:01:20,260
Now that's about everybody knows Tyson.
Everybody in,

22
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,750
especially after that fight because
it was such a spectacular fight.

23
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:27,200
Oh my God.
The first knocked down was great.

24
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:31,850
The second knock down was preposterous.
So the fact that he rose like Lazarus.

25
00:01:31,851 --> 00:01:34,070
Yeah. I mean it was crazy. And then one,

26
00:01:34,071 --> 00:01:37,430
the rest of the round he gets tagged a
few times and it starts boxing and then

27
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:41,770
even tagged Deontae I still had them
winning that fight. It was close. Oh,

28
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:46,910
Tyson. I think by around thing
boxing one that night. Every, yeah.

29
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:51,880
Both guys looked great and uh, boxed
well and made it exciting. Fight that,

30
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:55,510
the rematch. Obviously everybody
wants to see the rematch again.

31
00:01:55,990 --> 00:02:00,610
So when the rematch happened
that that put, um, Anthony
Joshua on the shelf. Yeah.

32
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:05,790
In my eyes now is put them on the
shelf a bit longer with this ESPN deal.

33
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,330
And you know, Tyson fury
is boxing in front of, uh,

34
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:14,080
the public, uh, Anthony,

35
00:02:14,081 --> 00:02:18,310
Joshua and Deontae there pay per
view right now. Who are they?

36
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,860
Gonna fight paper view.
Nobody wants to see no silly flight.

37
00:02:20,861 --> 00:02:23,750
They want to see what the
flights. Yeah. You know, it's,

38
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:27,800
it's a great move by Tyson fury. It's
a great mood. But the first fight,

39
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,700
the fight ended in a draw, right?
Yeah. Yeah. So in the draw,

40
00:02:31,701 --> 00:02:36,530
Deontae keeps the title,
but it least Tyson walks away like saying,

41
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:39,350
look, look, I won the decision. I feel
like I should have won the decision.

42
00:02:39,351 --> 00:02:41,390
There's a dispute,
there's a debate about it,

43
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:46,170
but everybody wants to see that fight.
I'm going to draw is not unreasonable,

44
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,260
but kaizen could lose to,
somebody

45
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:53,900
can lose to some fucking awesome. Yeah.
I want them mucking around saying, oh,

46
00:02:53,901 --> 00:02:57,080
I'll fight. This all won't find it
till next year somebody might lose.

47
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:57,950
This is what happens.

48
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:02,050
And now none of them can fight other
because if Joshua fights fury and loses to

49
00:03:02,051 --> 00:03:04,810
fury,
Joshua was a star goes down.

50
00:03:04,811 --> 00:03:09,100
If Josh will fights Deontae and beats
Deontae the Tyson Deontae fights.

51
00:03:09,101 --> 00:03:13,060
Not that exciting. But if Joshua
wants real respect, he's got a fight,

52
00:03:13,061 --> 00:03:16,060
either fury or Deontay fights.

53
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:18,100
Those are the big fight
obviously gets respect.

54
00:03:18,101 --> 00:03:21,400
He's the heavyweight champion of
the world, but split. You know,

55
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:25,750
that's a weird thing too. I'd like to see
Joshua Ortiz. I been interesting fight.

56
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:29,150
It would be an interesting cause.
Our teas can box and hit. Yeah.

57
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:33,610
Well that was what showed how God damn
powerful Deontae is that Ortiz was

58
00:03:33,611 --> 00:03:36,430
winning that fight. Yeah. And then I
was, I think it was the 10th round,

59
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:40,270
so the seventh or 10th I don't remember.
But I remember when he called them,

60
00:03:40,271 --> 00:03:43,530
I was like, God, that guy, he me late
in the fight. That guy carries that pal.
