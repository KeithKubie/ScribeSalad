00:00:01.106 --> 00:00:03.840
Let's say that we have four
siblings right over here.

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.012
They're trying to decide how to pick

00:00:06.012 --> 00:00:08.185
who should do the dishes each night.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.339
The oldest sibling right
over here he decides,

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:15.809
"I'll just put all of our
names into a bowl and then I'll

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.949
"just randomly pick one of
our names out of the bowl

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:21.206
"each night and then that
person is going to be -,"

00:00:21.206 --> 00:00:23.617
so this is the bowl
right over here and I'm

00:00:23.617 --> 00:00:25.767
going to put four sheets
of paper in there.

00:00:25.767 --> 00:00:27.954
Each of them is going to
have one of their names.

00:00:27.954 --> 00:00:30.453
He's just going to randomly
pick it out each night

00:00:30.453 --> 00:00:33.733
and that's the person who's
going to do their dishes.

00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:37.204
They all say, "That
seems like a reasonably

00:00:37.204 --> 00:00:40.516
fair thing to do," so
they start that process.

00:00:40.909 --> 00:00:46.311
Let's say that after the
first three nights that he,

00:00:46.311 --> 00:00:52.717
the oldest brother here.
Let's call him Bill.

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.062
Let's say after three nights Bill

00:00:55.062 --> 00:00:57.436
has not had to do the dishes.

00:00:58.475 --> 00:01:01.410
At that point the rest of
the siblings are starting to

00:01:01.645 --> 00:01:05.302
think maybe, just maybe
something fishy is happening.

00:01:05.302 --> 00:01:07.895
What I want to think about is what is

00:01:07.895 --> 00:01:09.802
the probability of that happening.

00:01:09.802 --> 00:01:12.177
What's the probability of three nights

00:01:12.177 --> 00:01:15.847
in a row Bill does not get picked?

00:01:15.847 --> 00:01:19.410
If we assume that we were randomly taking,

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.035
if Bill was truly randomly
taking these things

00:01:22.035 --> 00:01:24.740
out of the bowl and not
cheating in some way.

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.598
What's the probability
that that would happen?

00:01:26.598 --> 00:01:29.082
That three nights in a row
Bill would not be picked.

00:01:29.082 --> 00:01:31.146
I encourage you to pause the
video and think about that.

00:01:32.428 --> 00:01:33.769
Let's think about the probability that

00:01:33.769 --> 00:01:35.410
Bill's not picked on a given night.

00:01:35.707 --> 00:01:37.698
If it's truly random, so we're going

00:01:37.698 --> 00:01:41.118
to assume that Bill is not cheating.

00:01:41.613 --> 00:01:46.994
Assume truly random and
that each of the sheets

00:01:46.994 --> 00:01:50.129
of paper have a one in four
chance of being picked,

00:01:50.129 --> 00:01:52.774
what's the probability that
Bill does not get picked?

00:01:54.882 --> 00:01:58.023
The probability that, I guess let me

00:01:58.258 --> 00:02:03.638
write this, Bill not picked on a night.

00:02:06.773 --> 00:02:09.679
Well, there's four equally
likely outcomes and

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.369
three of them result in
Bill not getting picked,

00:02:12.369 --> 00:02:14.008
so there's a three fourths probability

00:02:14.008 --> 00:02:16.476
that Bill is not picked on a given night.

00:02:16.773 --> 00:02:17.993
What's the probability that Bill's

00:02:17.993 --> 00:02:20.225
not picked three nights in a row?

00:02:20.976 --> 00:02:22.335
Let me write that down.

00:02:22.335 --> 00:02:34.587
The probability Bill not
picked three nights in a row.

00:02:35.381 --> 00:02:38.506
Well that's the probability he's
not picked on the first night,

00:02:38.506 --> 00:02:41.289
times the probability that he's
not picked on the third night.

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:44.927
Times the probability that he's
not picked on the third night.

00:02:44.927 --> 00:02:47.312
That's going to be three
to the third power,

00:02:47.312 --> 00:02:49.187
or three times three times three,

00:02:49.187 --> 00:02:52.765
that's 27 over four to the third power.

00:02:52.765 --> 00:02:56.703
Four times four times four
is 64 and if we want to

00:02:56.703 --> 00:03:02.235
express that as a decimal.
Let me get my calculator out.

00:03:02.235 --> 00:03:07.610
That is 27 divided by
64 is equal to, and I'll

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.218
just round to the nearest
hundredth here, 0.42.

00:03:11.563 --> 00:03:19.140
That is equal to 0.42. This
doesn't seem that unlikely.

00:03:19.344 --> 00:03:22.188
It's a little less
likely than even odds but

00:03:22.188 --> 00:03:26.610
you wouldn't question
someone's credibility.

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:31.052
There's a 42 percent,
roughly a 42 percent chance

00:03:31.052 --> 00:03:33.753
that three nights in a row
Bill would not be picked.

00:03:33.753 --> 00:03:38.032
This seems like if you're
assuming truly random it's

00:03:38.032 --> 00:03:42.157
a reasonable, your hypothesis
that it's truly random,

00:03:42.973 --> 00:03:45.599
there's a good chance that you're right.

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:48.177
There's a 42 percent
chance you would have the

00:03:48.177 --> 00:03:51.022
outcome you saw if your
assumption is true.

00:03:51.801 --> 00:03:56.053
Let's say you keep doing this.
You trust your older brother,

00:03:56.053 --> 00:03:59.022
why would he want to cheat
out his younger siblings.

00:03:59.022 --> 00:04:04.022
Let's say that Bill's not
picked 12 nights in a row.

00:04:04.803 --> 00:04:07.836
Then everyone's starting to get a little

00:04:07.836 --> 00:04:14.899
bit suspicious with Bill right over here.

00:04:15.448 --> 00:04:18.991
They say, "We're going to give
him the benefit of the doubt."

00:04:18.991 --> 00:04:21.319
Assuming that he's
being completely honest,

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:24.318
that this a completely
random process, what is the

00:04:24.318 --> 00:04:28.399
probability that he would not
be picked 12 nights in a row?

00:04:29.398 --> 00:04:33.194
I'll just write that down.
The probability Bill,

00:04:33.194 --> 00:04:35.255
it's really the same stuff
that I wrote up here.

00:04:35.255 --> 00:04:41.708
I'll just say, Bill not
picked 12 nights in a row.

00:04:41.708 --> 00:04:43.477
That's going to be, you're going to take

00:04:43.696 --> 00:04:45.697
12 three fourths and
multiply them together.

00:04:45.697 --> 00:04:50.009
It's going to be three
fourths to the 12th power.

00:04:50.634 --> 00:04:52.217
What is this going to be equal to?

00:04:55.437 --> 00:04:58.371
I'll just write three divided four which

00:04:58.574 --> 00:05:03.262
is going to be 0.75 to the 12th power.

00:05:04.183 --> 00:05:06.746
This is a much smaller, this is now,

00:05:06.746 --> 00:05:10.763
this is going to be 0.3, I
guess we could go to one more

00:05:10.763 --> 00:05:18.856
decimal place, 0.32 or we
could say- 0.032 I should say,

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:23.442
which is approximately
equal to, let me write that,

00:05:23.442 --> 00:05:27.567
which is equal to 3.2 percent.

00:05:27.845 --> 00:05:29.440
Now you have every right to start

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.925
thinking that something is getting fishy.

00:05:31.925 --> 00:05:35.066
You could say, "If there
was --," this is what

00:05:35.066 --> 00:05:37.925
statisticians actually do,
they often define a threshold.

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.441
"If the probability of
this happening purely by

00:05:41.441 --> 00:05:45.768
"chance is more than five
percent then I'll say,

00:05:45.768 --> 00:05:47.941
"'Maybe it was happening
by chance,' but if the

00:05:47.941 --> 00:05:50.049
"probability of this
happening purely by chance,"

00:05:50.049 --> 00:05:53.424
and the threshold that
statisticians often use is

00:05:53.424 --> 00:05:55.958
five percent but that's
somewhat arbitrarily defined.

00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:59.239
This is a fairly low probably
that it would happen fairly

00:05:59.239 --> 00:06:05.619
by chance, so you might be
tempted to reject the hypothesis

00:06:05.836 --> 00:06:09.880
that it was truly random, that
Bill is cheating in some way.

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.334
And you could imagine if
it wasn't 12 in a row,

00:06:12.334 --> 00:06:15.053
if it was 20 in a row then this
probability becomes really,

00:06:15.053 --> 00:06:18.896
really, really, really, really
small, so your hypothesis

00:06:18.896 --> 00:06:23.647
that it's truly random starts
really coming to doubt.
