00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:03.660
Now I’m on the internet a lot, like a lot.

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:06.620
But could all this staying inside be making
me sick?

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:12.330
Hey guys, Julia here for DNews

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.120
In 1984 biologist E.O.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.039
Wilson first put forth the idea that humans
crave nature in his book “BioPhilia”.

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:21.970
Biophilia means love of life or living systems.

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.000
He argues that humans instinctively are attracted
to living things.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.279
And when we’re devoid of contact with nature,
there’s a discord in our lives.

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.529
We might suffer in our mood and in our health.

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.399
Some call this lack of living things, Nature
Deficit Disorder.

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:36.370
Sounds like a load of hogwash right?

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:37.980
Well there might be something to it.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.030
The term was first coined in 2005 by writer
Richard Louv in his book, “Last Child in

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.030
the Woods.”

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.040
The idea is that kids might be getting what
we call ADHD because they spend too much time

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.040
inside.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.140
Kids get loads of benefits from being outside.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.570
Like one big study published in the Proceedings
of the National Academy of Sciences found

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.480
that after spending time outside, kids attention
and memory improved.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.030
Other studies show that by playing outside,
kids get a boost in their immune systems.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.140
And even if you’re not a kid, spending time
in green spaces is really good for you too.

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.840
Another study also published in the journal
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.920
found that walking outside in a natural area
for 90 minutes is better for you than walking

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.420
outside in an urban area.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.630
While yeah, walking anywhere for 90 minutes
is good for you, their researchers found specific

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.820
changes in the brain when people went on more
natural walks.

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.530
They found decreased activity in the subgenual
prefrontal cortex.

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.939
This area is known to become particularly
active during rumination or when negative

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:31.049
thoughts keep playing on loop in your head.

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.799
So spending time in nature might help us be
better at emotional regulation and could lift

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.090
the mood in those who suffer from stress,
anxiety or depression.

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.509
And the University of Essex in England thinks
so too.

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:43.990
They’ve been studying the benefits of what
they call “green exercise” or exercise

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.350
in nature for over 12 years.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.400
One study published in the journal Environmental
Science and Technology found that green exercise

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.420
improves self-esteem and mood.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.090
Another study published in the same journal
found that maybe the color of nature has a

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.090
lot to do with it.

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.330
The researchers were curious about the idea
that “green exercise” is better for you

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.020
than working out in a gym.

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.490
So they designed an experiment where a few
cyclists watch nature videos that were either

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.780
hued, red, green or achromatic.

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.310
They found that their participants reported
lower total mood disturbance and ratings of

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.219
perceived exertion when watching the green
videos.

00:02:13.219 --> 00:02:16.879
But maybe it’s more than the color, maybe
it’s the smells.

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:21.150
Natural floral smells like lavender have been
shown to reduce stress, anxiety and depression.

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.739
Not to mention that going outside gets you
a burst of Vitamin D. Low levels of the stuff

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:27.920
have been linked to low mood and depression
according to a study published in the journal

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.609
Mayo Clinic Proceedings.

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:33.010
Experts recommend that people with fair skin
only need a few minutes of sunlight a day,

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.370
while those with darker skin might need more
like 15-20 minutes per day.

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.709
So, go outside, stop and smell the roses,
look at some green things, and soak in some

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:40.709
summer sun.

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:41.709
Speaking of summer!

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:43.260
Have you checked out our summer fun playlist?

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.299
So, when was the last time you frolicked in
nature?

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:06.400
Or are you a stay inside and stay on your
laptop kind of person?

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.749
