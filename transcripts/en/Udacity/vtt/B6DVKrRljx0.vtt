00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:06.983
As x increases, y or height also increases. This is a positive relationship. A

00:00:06.983 --> 00:00:11.933
negative relationship is when increases in x are associated with decreases in

00:00:11.933 --> 00:00:17.970
y. So it would look like this. Note that, these do not mean it's good or bad,

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:24.012
these are just terms to describe which direction the trend is going in. And you

00:00:24.012 --> 00:00:28.897
may remember this from learning about graphing lines. Lines with a positive

00:00:28.897 --> 00:00:33.253
slope go upwards whereas lines with a negative slope go downwards, from left to

00:00:33.253 --> 00:00:34.900
right.
