JON OLSON: My name is Jon
Olson and it is my honor

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.790
to introduce Marc
Solomon, National Campaign

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.530
Director for Freedom to Marry,
to speak about his new book

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:16.440
"Winning Marriage."

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:22.080
Last April I married my husband
thanks to Marc and his work,

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.440
and Freedom to Marry,
and a host of activists

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.310
from scores of organizations.

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.930
It was a big deal for me and
my husband, and our families

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:30.110
and friends.

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:32.619
But it wasn't political
and subversive,

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.190
the way gay marriage used
to be just 10 years ago.

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.640
I kept hoping for an
opportunity to be outraged,

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.980
but everyone from Medford
City Hall to Crate and Barrel

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.680
was just helpful and pleasant.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.450
In Massachusetts gay marriage
is just marriage now,

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.090
which is just as it should be.

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.890
Marc has received many
honors for his work

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.900
on marriage equality,
and Freedom to Marry

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.930
keeps winning court
battles, state

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.180
by state, across the country.

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.390
Amid all that acclaim, my little
voice doesn't amount to much,

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.100
but thank you.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.650
Your work is making the
world a better place,

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.400
and has made my life better.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.052
Welcome, Marc Solomon.

00:01:16.052 --> 00:01:20.320
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.045
MARC SOLOMON: Well,
thank you very much.

00:01:22.045 --> 00:01:24.460
It is great to be here.

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.390
It's great to be here
for a few reasons.

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.820
Number one, Google has been
just an incredible friend

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.530
to this cause over
the last decade

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.530
while we've been
battling it out.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.530
I remember being in California
during the last couple

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.340
weeks of the No On 8 Campaign--
the really devastating campaign

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.270
that our side lost-- and no
company was more represented

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:55.220
with respect to loaned staff
and support than Google.

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:01.120
And after amicus brief
Google is always there.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.510
So great thanks,
both to the company

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.740
and to the amazing employees
who put so much enthusiasm

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:13.460
into this cause, and it's making
the country a better place.

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.920
It's also great being here
in Cambridge, which is really

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.276
the cradle of this movement.

00:02:20.276 --> 00:02:22.400
I'm probably one of the
few people who sort of gets

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.011
choked up when I walk
past Cambridge City Hall,

00:02:26.011 --> 00:02:27.510
because that's where
it all started.

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.051
That's where this battle-- or
that's at least where marriages

00:02:30.051 --> 00:02:35.290
first started, and where
we realized the first winds

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.670
from this long, long battle.

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.820
I want to thank Jonathan
for welcoming me to Google

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.000
and putting this event together.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.410
So I want to talk a little
bit about where we are today,

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:52.930
and how we've gotten here.

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.770
My book is really--
"Winning Marriage"--

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.430
is really about how
we've gotten here.

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.930
But where we are today is
really quite exceptional.

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.750
We're not duking it out in
Cambridge, Massachusetts.

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.160
Today, the center of the
battle is Birmingham, Alabama.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:14.230
So we clearly have moved a long
way over the past 11 years.

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:19.220
We have 37 states,
really 37 and 1/2 states,

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:24.080
where same-sex couples can
marry, up from 11 years ago

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.030
when we had none.

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.240
There was just a
poll released by CNN

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.820
that showed that we have 63
percent support nationwide

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:36.470
for marriage equality.

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:42.670
Including 57 percent in the
south, and then from there.

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.770
And New England is in
the 70+ percent range.

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:53.170
We've now won 61 lawsuits
in the past year and a half,

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:56.610
or 61 out of about 66, 67.

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:59.310
So we're just on a
tremendous winning streak,

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:04.040
and we're headed to the US
Supreme Court once again.

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.660
More cases is
heading up there that

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:13.080
would end all the rest of these
bans, nationwide, on marriage.

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.970
Just the other day, Justice
Ruth Bader Ginsburg-- now known

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:25.060
as Notorious RBG-- who's
becoming cooler as she ages,

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.470
said, at George
Washington University,

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.190
"There hasn't been
any major change

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.720
in which there wasn't a
groundswell among the people

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.470
before the Supreme Court
put its stamp of approval

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:38.940
on the inclusion and the
equality concept of people

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.290
who are left out."

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:42.190
And really that's
where we believe

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:46.440
we are today, that we have
a critical mass of states,

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.950
37 states-- which is more than
70 percent of the country--

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:53.520
living in a state where
gay couples can marry.

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.540
63 percent support,
solid majority support,

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:00.300
in every part of the country.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.990
And we think America is ready
for national resolution,

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:08.570
and for the Supreme Court to
end the rest of these bans

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:12.610
on marriage, and make
a ruling nationwide.

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:15.000
But, of course as
you all know here,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.140
it hasn't always been that way.

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:21.170
I first got involved
in this fight in 2001

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:24.230
when I was a graduate
student down the street

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:26.530
a little bit at Harvard.

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:32.810
And that was right at
the time that GLAD,

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:34.820
Gay and Lesbian
Advocates and Defenders,

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:36.240
put together a lawsuit.

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:40.300
Seven same-sex couples went
to their town clerk's offices

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.310
throughout the state
of Massachusetts.

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:43.810
They applied for a
marriage license.

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:48.090
They were denied the license,
and then GLAD, on their behalf,

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:51.800
went to the Massachusetts
courts to sue.

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:57.510
And I will never, ever
forget November 18, 2003

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:01.930
when I remember I was sitting
at my computer at the Kennedy

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:04.760
School at Harvard at
8:00 in the morning,

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:08.030
and we'd been waiting day after
day after day for a ruling,

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:09.950
for a decision to
finally come down.

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:13.740
And the Supreme Judicial
Court puts on their website

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:16.550
at 8:00 AM which decisions
are coming down at 10:00 AM

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:17.650
that day.

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:20.290
And finally, that
day, November 18th,

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:24.500
it came up Goodridge versus the
Department of Public Health.

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.340
And I remember.

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:30.090
So then we all just-- I
was an active volunteer

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:32.940
at that point in this
very grassroots group

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:35.790
called the Massachusetts
Freedom to Marry Coalition

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:38.180
where we would go to prides,
and serve wedding cake,

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:40.900
and do all sorts of public
education, speakers,

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:44.620
bureaus-- real grassroots
organizing and activism.

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:50.680
And I was called at 9:00am that
morning by New England Cable

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:56.680
News, and they asked me if I
would be willing to be on live

00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:00.200
as the decision came in to
offer my sort of thoughts,

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:02.860
reflections on the decision.

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:04.760
And the first
thing I remember is

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:08.290
that I was wearing
a really ugly shirt,

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:11.680
and I was like, oh my
God, this is in an hour.

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:14.000
I don't have time to
go home and change.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:14.960
And I didn't.

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:16.500
And I thought everybody had
forgotten about the shirt

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:18.625
until somebody mentioned
it to me a few months ago.

00:07:18.625 --> 00:07:20.010
I was like, I guess not.

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:21.930
But that's not what's important.

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:28.470
I remember getting into a taxi
in Harvard Square at about 9:30

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:33.190
and heading over to Newton
where NECN is based.

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:38.730
And I was on the phone
with the folks at GLAD,

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:42.110
and they had Mary Bonauto
the superstar attorney

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:45.250
who had argued the case in
Massachusetts on speaker phone.

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:46.980
She was down at the
courthouse, and she

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:51.190
was leafing through the opinion,
and she said it's a full win.

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:55.520
And I was immediately
getting out of my taxi,

00:07:55.520 --> 00:08:01.190
I was wired up, whisked
into the studio,

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:03.900
and was sitting with
several of the anchors.

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:06.020
And they'd broken in
to broadcast this live

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:08.950
because it was such huge news.

00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:10.880
And what I remember
most from that day

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:15.980
was just the unbelievably
powerful response

00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:18.000
from our opponents.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.911
And it's important to remember
who our opponents were back

00:08:20.911 --> 00:08:21.410
then.

00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:24.700
I mean, certainly it was
the Catholic hierarchy,

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:27.040
and the Vatican issued
a strong statement

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:30.560
saying this would
never go into effect.

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:32.520
George W. Bush was one
of the first people

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:33.679
who issued a statement.

00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:35.740
He was gearing up
for his reelection.

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:38.970
He said that this
decision is wrong.

00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:40.280
It cannot happen.

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:43.789
These rogue judges in
Massachusetts can't do this.

00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:46.290
Our then governor,
who we have now

00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:49.144
shared with the rest of
the country, Mitt Romney,

00:08:49.144 --> 00:08:50.310
said something very similar.

00:08:50.310 --> 00:08:53.750
This will never go into
effect in my state.

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:56.050
And certainly the
religious right weighed in.

00:08:56.050 --> 00:08:58.780
But I think what's more
important for all of us

00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:00.930
to remember is
that it wasn't just

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:03.570
who we think of as the usual
suspects who weighed in

00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:05.350
in opposition.

00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:08.035
It was mainstream Democrats
across the country

00:09:08.035 --> 00:09:10.700
and in Massachusetts.

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:14.920
To give you a stark example,
John Kerry, our US Senator,

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:17.102
came out strongly
against the decision,

00:09:17.102 --> 00:09:18.560
and a couple months
later supported

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:20.850
a constitutional
amendment to take it away.

00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:23.267
So it was not just Republicans.

00:09:23.267 --> 00:09:24.475
It wasn't just conservatives.

00:09:24.475 --> 00:09:26.250
It wasn't just the
Catholic church.

00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:30.190
It was the whole political
system that was shaking.

00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:33.220
The Democrats were terrified
and wouldn't support it.

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:35.870
Republicans thought they
could use this as a weapon,

00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:38.750
or some of them at least.

00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:40.970
I remember in that two
hours on New England Cable

00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:43.670
News, the only person who
said something 100 percent

00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:46.490
positive who was a
national political figure

00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:48.720
was Barney Frank.

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:53.400
And I realized what a huge,
long way we have to go.

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:56.350
And I'd always been a
political operative,

00:09:56.350 --> 00:10:01.000
and you know necessity is
the mother of invention.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.910
And we started pulling
together a campaign

00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:08.190
that we called Mass Equality,
and I'm sure some of you

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:11.790
here were involved, in one way
or another, in Mass Equality.

00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:14.660
But it was a campaign
to protect the decision.

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:17.210
And what I talk about in my
book, "Winning Marriage"--

00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:21.710
which you can see over on that
table or everybody else can

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:26.750
find, I'm sure, on Amazon
or some other great site--

00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:28.810
is really how we've won.

00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:30.710
And I take you into
the statehouses

00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:33.920
around the country--
including the state house here

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:35.660
in Massachusetts where
I spend about 1/3

00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:38.750
of the book talking about
the battle in Massachusetts--

00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:43.570
into governors' mansions, into
courts, into the White House.

00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:46.400
And, more importantly,
into our campaign war rooms

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:51.840
where we built campaigns
to grow and seize power,

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:54.330
take on our opposition,
make our case

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:58.060
for why marriage matters
to same-sex couples,

00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:01.270
and make the case to straight
people that this is good.

00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:04.080
This is part of the evolution
of the American dream.

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:09.390
It's simply adding another
group into that struggle.

00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:15.290
And when I think about
why we've done so well,

00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:18.180
I'd say that there are
really two elements to it.

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:21.180
And two elements that our
campaign, our marriage equality

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:23.320
campaigns, have
done really well.

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:27.710
The first is that
we've told our stories.

00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:30.660
And I'm sure everybody's
heard that a lot.

00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:35.850
It's a building on what
Harvey Milk's admonition

00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:39.880
of coming out and sharing
your stories has been.

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:43.330
But we have really had to
take the American people

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:48.570
on a journey to explain
to them who gay people are

00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:50.780
and why marriage
is important to us.

00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:54.490
Marriage is a very
important institution

00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:57.000
to the American people.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.649
And whether or not they practice
what they preach with respect

00:12:01.649 --> 00:12:03.440
to marriage, and even
if they don't live up

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:11.130
to people's view of marriage,
it's still something

00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:13.110
that people hold
as very important.

00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:16.360
And what they wanted to know
was that same-sex couples

00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:18.850
were going to treat
marriage with respect,

00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:23.790
and not try to undermine
it or uproot it.

00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:28.080
And it might sound crazy
today, but that really

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:33.010
has been at the heart of
this battle, is to show

00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:35.220
why gay people want to marry.

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:37.940
Why marriage is important to us.

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:41.560
And to do it in a very
local kind of way.

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:44.550
Just to go back, because I
found this speech so profound--

00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:48.090
or her talk so profound-- Ruth
Ginsburg, Justice Ginsburg,

00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:52.920
the other day said, when she
was asked why she thinks things

00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:55.330
have changed so much,
she said, "People

00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:59.250
who once hid what they were
have announced to the world,

00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:00.940
this is what I am.

00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:02.490
And we look to
see what they are,

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:04.690
and they turned out to be
our next door neighbor,

00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:06.490
of whom we're very fond.

00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:10.290
It turned out to be our child's
best friend, or perhaps even

00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:11.340
our child.

00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:13.520
I think that accounts for
the very swift change."

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:16.320
And I think there's a lot of
truth in what she's saying,

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:22.600
but what's important is
that gets at a piece of it.

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:26.520
But the hard work behind
telling our stories

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:29.990
is what I think we've
done so effectively.

00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:32.460
It's really challenging,
really difficult,

00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:37.502
to share the story of who
you are with family members

00:13:37.502 --> 00:13:39.210
when you're afraid
you might be rejected.

00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:40.980
Or with neighbors
when you don't know

00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:42.730
how they're going to
respond and you still

00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:44.520
have to live next door to them.

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:46.690
With your legislator
when the last thing

00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:50.570
most people want to do is to
sit down and talk about anything

00:13:50.570 --> 00:13:53.120
personal with their legislator.

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:57.420
Particularly not in the
Cambridges and Bostons,

00:13:57.420 --> 00:14:00.400
but out in rural Massachusetts
and in rural parts

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:04.970
of any state, and
working-class communities.

00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:09.100
And so I wanted to share
a story of one couple

00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:11.690
from Massachusetts
who did this work so

00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:13.430
profoundly and
effectively, but who

00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:18.500
are the last couple you would
expect to do this kind of work.

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:21.260
So, and I'm going to read
a little bit from the book

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:25.070
and follow their
story through it.

00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:29.650
In the rural town of Charlton
in southern Worcester County,

00:14:29.650 --> 00:14:32.570
Deb Grzyb and Sharon
Murphy were pondering

00:14:32.570 --> 00:14:35.640
what to do about the Mass
Equality organizer who

00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:39.170
was asking them to meet with
their senator, Steve Brewer.

00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:42.380
Charlton was only 53
miles from Boston,

00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:44.840
but culturally it couldn't
have been more different.

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:46.230
It was the country.

00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:49.860
Pickup trucks with gun racks
cruising over the narrow roads

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:52.670
that wound through the wooded
terrain, and American flags

00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:55.110
everywhere, including
on Deb and Sharon's

00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:58.210
small but
beautifully-adorned home.

00:14:58.210 --> 00:15:00.710
The two were the most
unlikely activists.

00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:04.010
They'd just celebrated their
25th anniversary together.

00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:06.340
But until they'd
married the year before,

00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:09.750
they'd told next to no one that
they were lesbian or a couple.

00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:12.790
In fact, a few days after
they applied for their wedding

00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:15.770
license, they each raced
around the state coming out

00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:18.860
to family members--
including Sharon to her mom

00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:20.750
and siblings--
because they learned

00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:23.680
the local paper was going to
print the names of all those

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:25.280
who had applied.

00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:26.900
They were glad
there were activists

00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:29.090
who fought for equality
for gay people,

00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:32.110
but that simply
wasn't who they were.

00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:34.710
The Mass Equality
organizer was persistent,

00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:36.950
explaining how critical
it was for legislators

00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:40.920
to hear from married couples
who were their own constituents.

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:42.350
Their rural district
was one where

00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:46.350
you had next to no advocates, so
they were especially critical.

00:15:46.350 --> 00:15:48.470
They finally relented
and agreed to set up

00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:52.880
a meeting with their senator
when he was in their community.

00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:56.990
So now I'm going to fast-forward
to a meeting with their state

00:15:56.990 --> 00:16:01.650
representative, a conservative
Democrat named Paul Kujawski,

00:16:01.650 --> 00:16:03.650
whose vote was crucial.

00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:08.140
So this was at a meeting
that their pastor set up,

00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:11.880
and so their representative,
Kujawski, said,

00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:14.340
as the meeting reached
the two-hour mark-- Paul

00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:17.490
Kujawski became curious
to know about the lesbian

00:16:17.490 --> 00:16:18.710
couple in the room.

00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:21.600
He'd been told there was one
married couple in the group.

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:23.810
Well, who was the gay
couple here, he asked.

00:16:23.810 --> 00:16:26.170
Sharon and Deb each said, me.

00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:28.792
Pointing, Kujawski said, oh, I
thought you two were together.

00:16:28.792 --> 00:16:30.500
Deb was sitting next
to a straight woman,

00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:32.210
not next to Sharon.

00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:34.110
So are you married,
Kujawski asked.

00:16:34.110 --> 00:16:36.030
Yes we are, Sharon said.

00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:37.940
But when did you get married?

00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:40.930
July 12, 2004, she responded.

00:16:40.930 --> 00:16:42.570
Where did you get married?

00:16:42.570 --> 00:16:45.570
Oh, we got married in the
Headlands in Rockport.

00:16:45.570 --> 00:16:47.610
Kujawski was doing his
best to engage them,

00:16:47.610 --> 00:16:49.050
but they were reticent.

00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:53.320
Pastor John, the clergyman who
put this together, gave Sharon

00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:57.400
a gentle pat on her arm and
said, tell him your story.

00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:59.800
Sharon proceeded to talk
for 10 minutes about she

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:03.760
and Deb, how she and Deb met
27 years before in Boston.

00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:06.260
They knew they were in love,
and moved in together in Dudley

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:07.880
soon after.

00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:10.160
Growing up as a child,
she said, you always

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:12.062
think that someday
you'll get married.

00:17:12.062 --> 00:17:14.520
And then when you realize who
you are and the way the world

00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:17.130
is, you realize that,
well, that might never

00:17:17.130 --> 00:17:19.050
be an option for me.

00:17:19.050 --> 00:17:23.190
She talked about how she
and Deb lived quietly

00:17:23.190 --> 00:17:26.280
first in Dudley, and then up the
road eight miles in Charlton,

00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:29.690
and created a life together,
but that something was missing.

00:17:29.690 --> 00:17:32.150
She told Kujawski about
their wedding day,

00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:34.490
about how they took their
vows overlooking the Atlantic

00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:37.530
Ocean in Rockport, and how much
that day and their marriage

00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:38.860
mattered to them.

00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:42.490
For the first time, they were
legally related to one another.

00:17:42.490 --> 00:17:45.329
All we want is what
everyone else has, she said.

00:17:45.329 --> 00:17:47.870
We don't want anything more,
but we don't want anything less,

00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:49.380
either.

00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:51.820
Everyone was listening
with rapt attention,

00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:55.360
and Deb had tears
streaming down her face.

00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:59.040
Paul Kujawski just sat there
listening, staring, appearing

00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:00.440
a bit dumbfounded.

00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:03.350
This was a lot different from
what he'd expected to hear.

00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:06.580
The people he knew of who
were gay seemed like loners.

00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:08.670
He'd never seen
them with anybody,

00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:11.500
and he'd never thought
of it as a way of life.

00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:14.750
Kujawski was captivated by
the experience of two women

00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:16.700
from backgrounds like his own.

00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:18.350
Deb had grown up
in a Polish family

00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:22.162
in Dudley, the neighboring city
to his hometown of Webster.

00:18:22.162 --> 00:18:23.745
He was impressed by
Sharon's strength,

00:18:23.745 --> 00:18:26.030
and was sure of their
love for one another

00:18:26.030 --> 00:18:28.460
after 27 years together.

00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:31.320
All of a sudden, what had seemed
like a black and white decision

00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:33.670
on the marriage question
turned stark gray.

00:18:33.670 --> 00:18:35.670
His heart felt heavy.

00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:39.889
Wow, why didn't you say
that sooner, Kujawski asked.

00:18:39.889 --> 00:18:41.430
One of the last to
leave the meeting,

00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:43.570
Kujawski told Sharon
and Deb that he'd

00:18:43.570 --> 00:18:46.010
like to speak to them
again at some point.

00:18:46.010 --> 00:18:48.300
As he left the home
and walked to his car,

00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:50.162
his friend Mark, who
had hosted the meeting,

00:18:50.162 --> 00:18:52.120
thought it looked as if
the weight of the world

00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:53.590
was on the shoulders.

00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:56.350
Deb and Sharon sent Kujawski a
follow-up letter the next day

00:18:56.350 --> 00:18:57.006
to thank him.

00:18:57.006 --> 00:18:58.380
They said they'd
be happy to have

00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:01.290
more conversations with him.

00:19:01.290 --> 00:19:03.040
So over the course of
the next few months,

00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:05.560
and this was in 2007
when we were trying

00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:07.430
to get our crucial
vote in Massachusetts--

00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:10.850
we needed 3/4 of the legislature
to vote our way-- we had

00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:16.320
about 20 targets we were working
on to get over that mark,

00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:18.780
they ended up
meeting with Kujawski

00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:20.720
at least a couple more times.

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:25.030
And Mass Equality, we worked
on him pretty relentlessly

00:19:25.030 --> 00:19:28.060
using every lever that we could.

00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:31.850
So this is the day of the vote.

00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:34.550
The final vote in Massachusetts.

00:19:34.550 --> 00:19:36.750
Early that morning,
Kujawski saw himself

00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:38.880
on the front page
of the Boston Globe,

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:42.250
to which he'd given an interview
about his own thought process.

00:19:42.250 --> 00:19:45.060
A legislator finds himself
tugged in two directions,

00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:46.090
it was called.

00:19:46.090 --> 00:19:48.610
It talks about his meetings
with his priests, the governor,

00:19:48.610 --> 00:19:50.180
and the Speaker of the House.

00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:51.810
It said that Kujawski
appeared to be

00:19:51.810 --> 00:19:53.790
headed towards a
change of heart,

00:19:53.790 --> 00:19:57.310
and mentioned Sharon and Deb,
who endured so many struggles

00:19:57.310 --> 00:19:59.010
and are now so happy together.

00:19:59.010 --> 00:20:05.220
It quoted Kujawski as saying,
"Am I going to take that away?"

00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:08.040
Heading north and then
east for the 56-mile drive,

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:11.500
Kujawski was resolute that
he was doing the right thing.

00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:15.160
If I were gay, he thought, how
would I want to be treated?

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:16.660
And how could I
vote to treat anyone

00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:18.180
else differently from that?

00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:20.100
It was the real-life
stories that he'd heard,

00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:23.496
especially that of Sharon and
Deb, that made him understand.

00:20:23.496 --> 00:20:24.995
He figured no one
had approached him

00:20:24.995 --> 00:20:28.180
in the past because of his
reputation as a conservative,

00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:29.510
but no matter.

00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:31.590
Now he got it.

00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:33.930
And then this is
right after the votes.

00:20:33.930 --> 00:20:36.890
Deb and Sharon saw
Kujawski in the statehouse.

00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:38.780
Deb and Sharon saw
Kujawski walking down

00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:42.110
the corridor towards them
with a giant grin on his face.

00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:44.650
Sharon hugged and kissed
him, and, through the tears,

00:20:44.650 --> 00:20:46.510
thanked him for everything.

00:20:46.510 --> 00:20:50.060
Kujo, which was his nickname,
gave Deb a giant bear hug.

00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:52.570
The tears were flowing,
and they were all so happy.

00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:55.810
You made the difference
for me, Kujawski told them.

00:20:55.810 --> 00:20:57.490
After more tears
and embraces, they

00:20:57.490 --> 00:21:03.330
got an onlooker to snap a few
pictures of them all together.

00:21:03.330 --> 00:21:06.520
So that's the power
of the personal story,

00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:13.150
and we, as a campaign, have
done that with legislator

00:21:13.150 --> 00:21:16.670
after legislator
in Massachusetts.

00:21:16.670 --> 00:21:19.240
And then in every part
of the country that's

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:22.330
been at the heart of
explaining this cause

00:21:22.330 --> 00:21:26.040
to the American people
and to our lawmakers--

00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:28.430
Is really opening up
and sharing the crux

00:21:28.430 --> 00:21:32.610
of our personal stories,
and explaining why

00:21:32.610 --> 00:21:34.310
marriage is important to us.

00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:38.190
And as people saw that,
as marriages began here

00:21:38.190 --> 00:21:40.800
in Massachusetts and
then around the country,

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:43.390
people really started
to understand.

00:21:43.390 --> 00:21:46.470
Gay people want to marry for the
same reasons anyone else does.

00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:47.650
It's not a bad thing.

00:21:47.650 --> 00:21:49.860
It's actually a fine
thing and a good thing,

00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:52.050
and let's let it happen.

00:21:52.050 --> 00:21:53.760
But it took some
really hard work

00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:55.980
and some really
challenging conversations,

00:21:55.980 --> 00:21:58.030
people stepping out
of their comfort zone,

00:21:58.030 --> 00:22:00.860
in order to make that case.

00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:05.330
So if that's, in some
ways, the softer side

00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:08.850
of how we've evolved
the country on marriage,

00:22:08.850 --> 00:22:13.050
the harder side is
that we've put together

00:22:13.050 --> 00:22:16.107
some really smart campaigns
here in Massachusetts

00:22:16.107 --> 00:22:17.065
and around the country.

00:22:19.850 --> 00:22:25.250
Since I am here north
of the Charles River,

00:22:25.250 --> 00:22:27.060
one of the stories I
talk about in the book

00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:31.190
is the story of Carl Sciortino,
who some of you may know,

00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:35.320
who was a state representative
in Massachusetts.

00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:40.810
But just to take a step back,
the one truism about politics

00:22:40.810 --> 00:22:46.590
is that, for elected
officials, the thing that's

00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:49.200
most important to
an elected official

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:51.670
is continuing to be
an elected official.

00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:54.510
And if they think that a
vote is going to cost them

00:22:54.510 --> 00:22:57.790
their career, and if you're
banking on them taking a vote

00:22:57.790 --> 00:22:59.890
that they think is going
to cost them their career

00:22:59.890 --> 00:23:02.100
in order to win, you're
not going to win.

00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:05.120
That's is just the
way things are.

00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:07.440
And, initially here
in Massachusetts,

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:10.620
people thought that
a vote for marriage

00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:12.300
would cost them their career.

00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:14.330
And that's been the
case, not just here,

00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:15.810
but all over the country.

00:23:15.810 --> 00:23:17.570
And we had to turn
that on its head,

00:23:17.570 --> 00:23:21.370
but we had to do it first
here in Massachusetts.

00:23:21.370 --> 00:23:25.270
And what that meant is that
every person who voted our way,

00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:28.090
we had to work hard to
reelect to the legislature.

00:23:28.090 --> 00:23:30.290
And in legislatures
around the country,

00:23:30.290 --> 00:23:33.120
there's some good folks,
there's some mediocre folks,

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:36.830
there's some corrupt
folks, there's some people

00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:38.290
with personal problems.

00:23:38.290 --> 00:23:41.240
You get the full
gamut of humanoids

00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:42.985
in these state legislatures.

00:23:42.985 --> 00:23:43.860
But it didn't matter.

00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:45.860
If they voted our way
we had to do everything

00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:47.510
we could to get them reelected.

00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:54.100
And the biggest thing
that we could do,

00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:56.270
the thing that could really
turn things on its head,

00:23:56.270 --> 00:24:02.149
would be to defeat a couple of
lawmakers who voted against us.

00:24:02.149 --> 00:24:04.440
Then you would really start
getting people's attention.

00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:08.140
That not only is this
a safe political cause,

00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:10.920
but it's dangerous
to vote against us.

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:14.020
And that was the story of Carl
Sciortino, who some of you

00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:14.520
may know.

00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:16.700
You might have
seen his ad when he

00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:18.780
was running for
Congress recently

00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:20.990
with this Tea Party father.

00:24:20.990 --> 00:24:23.120
That was a really
terrific political ad.

00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:25.580
But he was a
25-year-old graduate

00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:30.280
of Tufts University, headed
up the LGBT group at Tufts,

00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:32.010
and met with his state
lawmaker, who was

00:24:32.010 --> 00:24:34.780
really terrible on marriage.

00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:37.210
He kept saying you people,
you people, you people.

00:24:37.210 --> 00:24:40.030
And Carl was so annoyed
and really angry

00:24:40.030 --> 00:24:42.120
that he said, look,
we've got to find someone

00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:43.120
to run against this guy.

00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:46.640
And he went out and talked
to-- and his legislature was

00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:49.120
a Democrat from
Medford Somerville-- he

00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:51.830
went out and talked to
other elected officials,

00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:54.510
said hey-- and other
activists-- and said, hey,

00:24:54.510 --> 00:24:55.897
would you run against this guy?

00:24:55.897 --> 00:24:57.730
Nobody would do it, and
he's like, screw it.

00:24:57.730 --> 00:24:59.130
I'll do it myself.

00:24:59.130 --> 00:25:02.061
And I've got to be
honest, when I first

00:25:02.061 --> 00:25:04.310
met with Carl-- who is now
one of my closest friends--

00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:09.080
when I first met with him and
I was like, this is great.

00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:11.170
Good luck.

00:25:11.170 --> 00:25:13.661
25 gay guy from Tufts.

00:25:13.661 --> 00:25:14.160
Good luck.

00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:15.800
Go knock on doors and see.

00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:18.610
It wasn't until I really
looked at his campaign plan,

00:25:18.610 --> 00:25:20.530
and met with this
campaign consultants,

00:25:20.530 --> 00:25:23.680
and saw the polling, and saw
how vulnerable his opponent was

00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:25.190
that I was like,
this could really--

00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:31.870
if we all do this smartly--
this could really happen.

00:25:31.870 --> 00:25:37.840
And, in the end, Carl did a
great job in that election.

00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:42.200
And he defeated the
16-year incumbent who

00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:46.250
was one of the-- he was a
member of leadership, important

00:25:46.250 --> 00:25:49.200
to the House Speaker, who was
then virulently against us-- he

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:52.980
defeated him by about 90 votes.

00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:58.361
And I remember a week
after that election

00:25:58.361 --> 00:26:00.610
a friend of mine who was a
lobbyist in the state house

00:26:00.610 --> 00:26:05.900
called me and said I was
just in the restroom,

00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:08.200
and I overheard these two
conservative lawmakers

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:09.530
talking to one another.

00:26:09.530 --> 00:26:12.600
And they said, hey, did you
hear what the gays did to Vinny?

00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:14.220
That was the guy
that Carl defeated.

00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:16.127
And when I heard that
story, I was like, wow,

00:26:16.127 --> 00:26:17.460
we really are getting somewhere.

00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:19.720
We're starting to
show our power.

00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:23.130
And so we've put together
a smart-- We did it here.

00:26:23.130 --> 00:26:28.660
We reelected, in Massachusetts,
195 out of 195 incumbents

00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:29.490
who voted our way.

00:26:29.490 --> 00:26:32.790
We didn't lose any
race in 2004 and 2006.

00:26:32.790 --> 00:26:35.000
That was in spite of the
fact that Mitt Romney

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.620
tried his hardest to
elect more Republicans

00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:40.070
to the legislature, the
vast majority of whom--

00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:43.340
back then-- were against us.

00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:48.850
We spent well over
a million dollars.

00:26:48.850 --> 00:26:51.410
We did millions of
pieces of direct mail.

00:26:51.410 --> 00:26:55.180
We polled in dozens
and dozens of races.

00:26:55.180 --> 00:26:57.590
And that's been one of
the tenets of our work

00:26:57.590 --> 00:27:00.730
around the country, is putting
together smart campaigns.

00:27:00.730 --> 00:27:03.539
And knowing that
we have to operate

00:27:03.539 --> 00:27:05.580
both in the political
system and in the political

00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:06.850
climates in which we are.

00:27:06.850 --> 00:27:11.330
So there's some really sleazy
state capitals out there.

00:27:11.330 --> 00:27:15.980
I had the good fortune
of spending several weeks

00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:18.950
in Albany, New York, which is
just really a terrible place.

00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:21.300
Not the city so much,
but the politics

00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:23.050
are just really grim there.

00:27:23.050 --> 00:27:27.969
And they call it a
transactional state capitol,

00:27:27.969 --> 00:27:30.260
and you don't even want to
know what that really means.

00:27:32.910 --> 00:27:34.990
But we put together
a sharp campaign

00:27:34.990 --> 00:27:36.740
and partnered up
with Governor Cuomo,

00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:40.010
who was a powerful advocate.

00:27:40.010 --> 00:27:42.260
We, as a community, had been
involved in the elections

00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:42.990
there.

00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:46.920
And we pulled that one
out in spite of the fact

00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:50.850
that both Republican
leadership in the state Senate

00:27:50.850 --> 00:27:53.420
and Democratic leadership
we're trying to,

00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:57.660
for various reasons, trying
to torpedo the marriage bill.

00:27:57.660 --> 00:27:59.670
Springfield, Illinois
was the same way.

00:27:59.670 --> 00:28:02.630
Also an incredibly
sleazy state capitol.

00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:07.127
Except there are pictures and
photos and statues of Abraham

00:28:07.127 --> 00:28:08.960
Lincoln all over, looking
over your shoulder

00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:15.990
as these lawmakers are trying
to do some less than above-board

00:28:15.990 --> 00:28:18.650
things.

00:28:18.650 --> 00:28:22.260
And after 2008 in
California when

00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:24.620
we have that devastating
loss of Proposition 8,

00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:29.840
which truly was a horrible,
awful thing that was--

00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:32.830
and it was a real body
blow to our movement

00:28:32.830 --> 00:28:34.140
and to our community.

00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:37.910
For me, it was such a body
blow that I picked up,

00:28:37.910 --> 00:28:44.790
I came back to Massachusetts,
left Mass Equality,

00:28:44.790 --> 00:28:49.420
moved to California to put
together a ballot campaign

00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:51.324
to win marriage back.

00:28:51.324 --> 00:28:53.240
It eventually got won
back through the courts,

00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:55.490
and I left and joined
Freedom to Marry.

00:28:55.490 --> 00:28:59.480
But I knew it was so
profoundly devastating.

00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:02.210
And that we, the
spirit of our community

00:29:02.210 --> 00:29:04.130
and the spirit of this
battle for marriage,

00:29:04.130 --> 00:29:07.650
wouldn't come back until
we'd won marriage back

00:29:07.650 --> 00:29:09.110
in California.

00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:12.410
But what we did is we
didn't just sit there.

00:29:12.410 --> 00:29:14.420
We spent the next few
years figuring out

00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:15.780
how to win at the ballot.

00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:18.640
And in 2012 we did
finally win at the ballot

00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:21.230
after 33 losses in a row.

00:29:21.230 --> 00:29:23.665
We won at the ballot in
four states, four out

00:29:23.665 --> 00:29:29.200
of four, in November of 2012,
in Washington, and Minnesota,

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:31.210
and Maryland, and Maine.

00:29:31.210 --> 00:29:33.140
And we did it by
figuring out better

00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:36.240
how to talk about
marriage, and really

00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:39.170
how to run smart,
strategic campaigns.

00:29:39.170 --> 00:29:40.910
So running smart
campaigns has also

00:29:40.910 --> 00:29:43.810
been at the heart of this fight.

00:29:43.810 --> 00:29:50.070
And even and through getting
President Obama to evolve

00:29:50.070 --> 00:29:52.300
on marriage, and
we ran a campaign

00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:56.460
to put a Freedom to Marry plank
in the Democratic platform

00:29:56.460 --> 00:30:02.000
in 2012-- which gave a
lot of the Obama folks

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.210
and a lot of Democrats
a lot of heartburn.

00:30:04.210 --> 00:30:09.770
But we pushed, and he did the
right thing, and was then-- he

00:30:09.770 --> 00:30:14.530
and the party were incredibly
proud of what that meant,

00:30:14.530 --> 00:30:17.220
and what that did for
him and his legacy

00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:21.870
and for his ability to
reach out to younger voters.

00:30:21.870 --> 00:30:27.420
So if the two keys to this,
and I'm only touching on them,

00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:32.180
but if the two keys to winning
were telling our stories

00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:35.480
and explaining to
the American people

00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:37.740
why marriage was
so important to us,

00:30:37.740 --> 00:30:39.750
and explaining the
integrity-- and showing

00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:41.470
the integrity-- of
our relationships,

00:30:41.470 --> 00:30:47.430
and then running hard,
tough, smart campaigns--

00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:50.370
I think a little bit
about what inspired

00:30:50.370 --> 00:30:55.366
me to write this book in
the middle of this fight.

00:30:55.366 --> 00:30:56.740
When I started
writing, we really

00:30:56.740 --> 00:30:58.114
were in the middle
of this fight.

00:30:58.114 --> 00:31:00.530
We're hopefully getting
closer to the end now,

00:31:00.530 --> 00:31:02.980
but there are
really two reasons.

00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:06.780
And the first reason I decided
to write "Winning Marriage"

00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:12.560
is because the cause of civil
rights is a very lofty cause.

00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:18.194
And it is profound, and
lofty, and high minded,

00:31:18.194 --> 00:31:19.610
but what I really
wanted to do was

00:31:19.610 --> 00:31:21.060
show the work of civil rights.

00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:25.000
And the work of civil rights
is not lofty work in the main.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.890
It is going out and
knocking on doors.

00:31:27.890 --> 00:31:33.080
Not in Cambridge, but going
out to far out communities

00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:38.150
in Middlesex County and out to
Worcester and rural Worcester

00:31:38.150 --> 00:31:39.030
County.

00:31:39.030 --> 00:31:43.965
And out away from New York City
into the suburban-- and not

00:31:43.965 --> 00:31:47.420
just suburban communities-- but
into smaller cities and towns.

00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:49.360
And in California,
it's organizing

00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:52.060
in the Central Valley, in
Fresno and Bakersfield,

00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:54.010
and Orange County.

00:31:54.010 --> 00:31:59.220
It's having tough conversations
in parts of the community,

00:31:59.220 --> 00:32:03.010
in parts of the geography
that don't feel as safe

00:32:03.010 --> 00:32:05.460
and that aren't as supportive.

00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:08.260
That's the work
of this movement.

00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:10.800
When I think about all the
canvassers and organizers

00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:14.360
I've had working for me
now in the last 11 years,

00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:17.080
I've had hundreds and
hundreds of organizers,

00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:20.640
who are just amazing, work
and take this work on.

00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:24.950
And I bet there have been
at least 10 dog bites.

00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:28.800
And I know that there have
been many more people who

00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:31.040
have been chased down
the streets by homophobes

00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:33.390
in different communities.

00:32:33.390 --> 00:32:36.220
And that's the hard
work of civil rights.

00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:40.870
It's giving to a
political candidate who

00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:43.194
your state-wide LGBT
group says is important

00:32:43.194 --> 00:32:44.360
because they voted your way.

00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:46.890
Even if you don't know
who that person really is.

00:32:46.890 --> 00:32:49.590
Or going out and knocking
on doors for that candidate.

00:32:49.590 --> 00:32:51.960
And it is having those
tough conversations

00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:54.340
that you feel like,
oh my God, I finally

00:32:54.340 --> 00:32:56.700
need to have this
conversation with this family

00:32:56.700 --> 00:33:01.100
member or this neighbor, or
need to have a little house

00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:04.360
party in my neighborhood
to explain why this is

00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:07.400
important to me and my partner
when, for so many years,

00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:11.040
we've been living with our heads
down because-- let's face it--

00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:12.310
we don't want to create waves.

00:33:12.310 --> 00:33:13.893
We don't want people
to come after us.

00:33:13.893 --> 00:33:16.060
We don't want to be attacked.

00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:19.860
That's been the
heart of this work.

00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:20.850
And it continues.

00:33:20.850 --> 00:33:24.340
That's the work that's happening
today in Texas, and in Alabama,

00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:28.260
and throughout the South.

00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:31.010
So I did want to show, really,
the nuts and bolts of what

00:33:31.010 --> 00:33:33.580
these campaigns are about
and the hard, hard work that

00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:34.610
has gone into them.

00:33:34.610 --> 00:33:38.360
And also the thing that's really
exciting about our success

00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:41.060
is that I-- and the other reason
I wanted to write this book--

00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:45.950
is I wanted to provide
something of a road map

00:33:45.950 --> 00:33:47.700
for other social movements.

00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:50.570
I mean, there are so many
causes in our country

00:33:50.570 --> 00:33:53.490
that are really
stagnating right now.

00:33:53.490 --> 00:33:57.370
And our cause, the marriage
cause, has done quite well.

00:33:57.370 --> 00:34:02.310
And I don't pretend to have
all the answers for all causes

00:34:02.310 --> 00:34:05.540
in the lease, but I do think
that over the last decade

00:34:05.540 --> 00:34:09.550
of trial and error and losing
and losing and then winning,

00:34:09.550 --> 00:34:12.960
and figuring things out,
I think we have learned

00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:14.810
some important things
that we can share

00:34:14.810 --> 00:34:17.469
with other social movements.

00:34:17.469 --> 00:34:20.469
Whether it's economic
inequality, or gun violence

00:34:20.469 --> 00:34:23.050
prevention, or global warming.

00:34:23.050 --> 00:34:25.330
And one of the really
exciting things

00:34:25.330 --> 00:34:29.440
these days is that I am asked to
speak to other social movements

00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:33.710
and other groups who are leading
social movements about how

00:34:33.710 --> 00:34:36.010
we've done and how the
marriage movement has done it,

00:34:36.010 --> 00:34:37.130
and what we can teach.

00:34:37.130 --> 00:34:42.591
So that really feels great
to be able to do that.

00:34:42.591 --> 00:34:48.610
And I guess I want to conclude
with a little bit about where

00:34:48.610 --> 00:34:51.940
we are in this fight right now.

00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:57.810
So I said we are, literally
and metaphorically, we're

00:34:57.810 --> 00:35:00.000
on the steps of the
US Supreme Court.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:04.700
And we are close, we
hope, to final resolution.

00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:07.810
But I want to caution
all of us that one

00:35:07.810 --> 00:35:10.310
of things I hear
now, so often, is

00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:12.530
that this cause is inevitable.

00:35:12.530 --> 00:35:13.030
It's done.

00:35:13.030 --> 00:35:15.130
It's over.

00:35:15.130 --> 00:35:19.840
And when I think back
to when I first started,

00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:21.600
when I first was
going to those prides,

00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:25.780
and serving wedding cake, and
making the case for marriage--

00:35:25.780 --> 00:35:29.960
first to LGBT people,
and then to progressives,

00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:32.850
and then further out,
reaching out to Republicans--

00:35:32.850 --> 00:35:34.380
people were saying,
this is crazy.

00:35:34.380 --> 00:35:35.270
This is impossible.

00:35:35.270 --> 00:35:38.920
I would go to Club Cafe and
meet up with my friends there,

00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:40.680
and they'd be like,
what are you doing?

00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:41.680
Working on gay marriage?

00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:42.950
This is never going to happen.

00:35:42.950 --> 00:35:45.790
You're just pissing off
the Catholic church.

00:35:45.790 --> 00:35:49.070
And so the pitch
was, it's impossible.

00:35:49.070 --> 00:35:53.300
And I was thinking about
how much commonality

00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:56.350
there is between the
impossible and inevitable.

00:35:56.350 --> 00:36:01.250
And what really brings
those two things together,

00:36:01.250 --> 00:36:03.070
or what's really the
same about those two,

00:36:03.070 --> 00:36:05.890
is they both allow
you to sit around.

00:36:05.890 --> 00:36:08.930
If something's impossible,
why would do Anything

00:36:08.930 --> 00:36:10.482
it's just impossible.

00:36:10.482 --> 00:36:11.940
And if it's
inevitable, same thing.

00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:13.106
It's going to happen anyway.

00:36:13.106 --> 00:36:15.030
Why would I get up
and do something?

00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:18.830
And I guess, number one,
the work of social movements

00:36:18.830 --> 00:36:22.780
and the work of causes that
are big and worth fighting

00:36:22.780 --> 00:36:26.250
for is the work of taking
something that feels,

00:36:26.250 --> 00:36:31.190
to so many people, impossible,
and making progress

00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:32.080
every single day.

00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:34.122
Building momentum
every single day,

00:36:34.122 --> 00:36:36.580
until the point where we are
today where so many people are

00:36:36.580 --> 00:36:38.500
saying now it's inevitable.

00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:41.980
But what I'd say, I would
also say it's not inevitable.

00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:44.150
I mean, very little
is inevitable.

00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:47.770
It's not like we have a nine
to nothing majority on the US

00:36:47.770 --> 00:36:49.300
Supreme Court.

00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:52.500
And our job over
the next few months,

00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:55.870
and what we're working
on, literally, right now,

00:36:55.870 --> 00:36:58.040
is making the
strongest presentation

00:36:58.040 --> 00:37:00.520
we can to the US Supreme
Court that America

00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:02.660
is ready for
national resolution,

00:37:02.660 --> 00:37:05.450
and it's time to finish the job.

00:37:05.450 --> 00:37:09.580
And I am one who
would-- I end up

00:37:09.580 --> 00:37:11.460
using lots of sports analogies.

00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:13.916
We should never spike the
ball on the 10-yard line.

00:37:13.916 --> 00:37:15.540
We've got to leave
it all on the field.

00:37:15.540 --> 00:37:19.980
We just have to keep going
hard until the court rules.

00:37:19.980 --> 00:37:23.300
And if they rule
our way then we can

00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:24.950
have lots and lots
of big parties

00:37:24.950 --> 00:37:27.230
and celebrate that it
actually is inevitable

00:37:27.230 --> 00:37:28.320
because it's done.

00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:30.520
But until it's done,
it's not yet done.

00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:35.100
And we do have 70
percent of the country

00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:37.390
where gay people can
marry, but I was just

00:37:37.390 --> 00:37:40.520
out in Columbus, Ohio last week.

00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:44.630
And Ohio's a state where
there is not yet the freedom

00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:45.480
to marry.

00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:47.800
And they certainly
don't think it's done.

00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:52.370
And we have organizers on the
ground in Texas and in Alabama.

00:37:52.370 --> 00:37:54.830
And in Texas they certainly
don't think it's done.

00:37:54.830 --> 00:37:57.420
So there's still
work to be done.

00:37:57.420 --> 00:37:58.530
The cause isn't over yet.

00:37:58.530 --> 00:38:00.540
We need to fight
through the finish line.

00:38:00.540 --> 00:38:05.650
So I guess I would and there.

00:38:05.650 --> 00:38:10.840
And, again, I want to thank
our friends at Google.

00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:14.670
When I think about how
politicians are often

00:38:14.670 --> 00:38:18.140
about a decade behind
where the public is,

00:38:18.140 --> 00:38:22.210
corporations have been really
helping guide this fight.

00:38:22.210 --> 00:38:24.310
And it's companies
like Google that

00:38:24.310 --> 00:38:29.730
have been showing politicians
and others that not only is it

00:38:29.730 --> 00:38:32.690
safe to be in favor of
the freedom to marry,

00:38:32.690 --> 00:38:34.580
but it's actually good business.

00:38:34.580 --> 00:38:35.860
So thanks to all of you.

00:38:35.860 --> 00:38:36.800
Thanks for coming.

00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:40.610
And I look forward to chatting,
answering any questions,

00:38:40.610 --> 00:38:43.550
and signing books,
and hanging out.

00:38:43.550 --> 00:38:45.236
MALE SPEAKER: I have a question.

00:38:45.236 --> 00:38:47.110
From your experience--
one of the things that

00:38:47.110 --> 00:38:50.660
worries me about America today
is the enormous influence

00:38:50.660 --> 00:38:55.290
of money in politics, the
vast corruption of our system,

00:38:55.290 --> 00:38:57.010
is there anything to
be done about that?

00:38:57.010 --> 00:39:03.600
How do we get money
out of politics?

00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:05.220
MARC SOLOMON: That's
a good question.

00:39:05.220 --> 00:39:08.750
So I'd say there's
sort of two answers.

00:39:08.750 --> 00:39:13.250
I mean, on the first--
right now, as you know

00:39:13.250 --> 00:39:15.445
and as you stated,
there are huge amounts

00:39:15.445 --> 00:39:16.320
of money in politics.

00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:20.760
And so, from my vantage
point, we have to,

00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:22.737
in the marriage
movement, we've certainly

00:39:22.737 --> 00:39:24.320
had to play by the
rules that we have.

00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:29.720
And so we have
used as much money

00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:33.710
as we can get our hands
on to make the case

00:39:33.710 --> 00:39:36.180
and to win elections.

00:39:36.180 --> 00:39:39.234
But now with these just
ridiculous amounts of money,

00:39:39.234 --> 00:39:41.150
when you read something
like the Koch brothers

00:39:41.150 --> 00:39:45.720
are going to spend $900 million
in this next presidential

00:39:45.720 --> 00:39:48.870
election cycle, it's
just outrageous.

00:39:48.870 --> 00:39:56.180
I think that it's very, very
difficult because the court has

00:39:56.180 --> 00:39:59.020
ruled that money is speech.

00:39:59.020 --> 00:40:01.180
And, from my vantage
point, it's not speech.

00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:02.770
Money is money.

00:40:02.770 --> 00:40:03.950
And money is influence.

00:40:03.950 --> 00:40:06.137
It's not simply speech.

00:40:06.137 --> 00:40:07.720
So I guess there are
a couple answers.

00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:12.370
One is work to elect
a president who

00:40:12.370 --> 00:40:14.860
will appoint Supreme Court
justices who don't believe

00:40:14.860 --> 00:40:16.990
that money is speech.

00:40:16.990 --> 00:40:21.850
And, second, there are
efforts to start building

00:40:21.850 --> 00:40:24.210
towards a constitutional
amendment.

00:40:24.210 --> 00:40:28.380
That's going to be
a long, long road.

00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:32.390
So that's going
to be a tough one.

00:40:32.390 --> 00:40:37.030
But there are some good
people working on this cause.

00:40:37.030 --> 00:40:41.630
And so I don't have
a-- there's certainly

00:40:41.630 --> 00:40:43.040
no simple answer to that one.

00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:46.270
But those are a couple.

00:40:46.270 --> 00:40:48.621
Do you have a second question?

00:40:48.621 --> 00:40:50.040
You don't have to.

00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:51.980
MALE SPEAKER: With
respect to climate change,

00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:54.350
which is something that
worries me very much--

00:40:54.350 --> 00:40:55.230
MARC SOLOMON: Yeah.

00:40:55.230 --> 00:40:55.850
MALE SPEAKER: I was
thinking about how

00:40:55.850 --> 00:40:58.330
to apply your lessons in
the space of climate change,

00:40:58.330 --> 00:41:03.730
but the personal stories
are a lot harder to come by.

00:41:03.730 --> 00:41:07.200
I don't get to marry
a polar bear, so

00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:11.080
what-- can you paint a
little more of a picture

00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:15.070
about how your
techniques pertain

00:41:15.070 --> 00:41:18.100
to a more abstract issue
like climate change?

00:41:18.100 --> 00:41:20.920
MARC SOLOMON: Yeah,
I mean, I think

00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:25.450
the more we can make it
local, any cause local,

00:41:25.450 --> 00:41:27.600
the better off we are.

00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:31.420
On LGBT rights and
on marriage equality,

00:41:31.420 --> 00:41:33.070
when we first started
working on it,

00:41:33.070 --> 00:41:35.870
people were talking about--
when we'd do focus groups

00:41:35.870 --> 00:41:38.879
and we'd watch people and
they'd talk about those people

00:41:38.879 --> 00:41:41.170
out there-- those people in
San Francisco, those people

00:41:41.170 --> 00:41:43.631
in New York-- not people
right here at home.

00:41:43.631 --> 00:41:47.520
So I haven't spent a
lot of time focused

00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:49.630
on how to make the
case on climate change,

00:41:49.630 --> 00:41:53.260
but I think making it
as local as possible

00:41:53.260 --> 00:41:56.170
and having people talk
about local impact,

00:41:56.170 --> 00:41:59.740
so how's it going to
affect Boston, how's

00:41:59.740 --> 00:42:04.440
it going to affect our
children living here in Boston,

00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:06.920
is really important.

00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:12.720
That's the-- I think it's,
from my vantage point,

00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:15.800
it's got to be about people
as opposed to polar bears,

00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:17.310
even though they're cute.

00:42:17.310 --> 00:42:21.810
I think to the extent we can
talk about how it is affecting

00:42:21.810 --> 00:42:27.190
people, and how it's
affecting our kids,

00:42:27.190 --> 00:42:31.730
I think that's the way to do it.

00:42:31.730 --> 00:42:34.810
Those are just a
couple thoughts.

00:42:34.810 --> 00:42:38.890
And I would love to sit down
and plot with some of my friends

00:42:38.890 --> 00:42:42.170
who are working on this issue.

00:42:42.170 --> 00:42:44.100
But those are a couple thoughts.

00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:44.940
Thank you.

00:42:44.940 --> 00:42:48.277
