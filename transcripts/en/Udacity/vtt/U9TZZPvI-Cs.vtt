00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.320
The job of the Control Plane is to compute

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:06.920
state that ultimately ends up in the data plane.

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.420
So computing a forwarding path that satisfies a high-level

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.360
policy is something that the Control Plane would do.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.990
The Control Plane can also compute shortest path routing

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.210
trees. And it might make decisions about whether or

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.810
not a user's device should be allowed to send

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.525
traffic or not based on that device's MAC address.

00:00:24.525 --> 00:00:28.530
Rate-limiting is something that is typically done

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.460
in the data plane, and the load-balancing example

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:37.170
that we have listed here. Is such that a router or a switch would make

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.300
decisions in the data plane based on a hash of the source IP address. So

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.130
all of the decisions are being made at

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:49.160
forwarding time, not by a centralized high-level program.
