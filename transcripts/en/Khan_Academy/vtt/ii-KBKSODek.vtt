00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:01.838
- [Voiceover] In the last
videos, we constructed

00:00:01.838 --> 00:00:03.928
a little bit of a conundrum for us.

00:00:03.928 --> 00:00:07.132
We had the situation where
I'm drifting through space,

00:00:07.132 --> 00:00:09.222
and right at time equal zero,

00:00:09.222 --> 00:00:13.030
one of my friends, she passes me by

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.537
in a spaceship going
half the speed of light

00:00:15.537 --> 00:00:18.463
in the positive x
direction, relative to me.

00:00:18.463 --> 00:00:20.692
And at time equal zero,

00:00:20.692 --> 00:00:23.656
is exactly where she is at my position.

00:00:23.656 --> 00:00:26.233
And then she keeps
traveling, and so I draw

00:00:26.233 --> 00:00:28.137
the path that she is taking.

00:00:28.137 --> 00:00:30.227
So after one second, she would be here,

00:00:30.227 --> 00:00:32.293
after two seconds, she would be there,

00:00:32.293 --> 00:00:33.593
and we set up our scales

00:00:33.593 --> 00:00:36.356
so that on our time axis,

00:00:36.356 --> 00:00:39.003
one second is the same length

00:00:39.003 --> 00:00:42.138
as on our space axis, or on our path axis,

00:00:42.138 --> 00:00:44.576
three times ten to the eighth meters.

00:00:44.576 --> 00:00:47.269
And we did that so that at
least in my frame of reference,

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:50.381
the speed of light would
be at a 45 degree angle,

00:00:50.381 --> 00:00:52.029
or would have a slope of one.

00:00:52.029 --> 00:00:54.142
But the conundrum we hit was

00:00:54.142 --> 00:00:56.209
is that the speed of
light would be perceived,

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:57.904
based on this model I set up,

00:00:57.904 --> 00:00:59.645
would be perceived differently

00:00:59.645 --> 00:01:01.944
based on which frame
of reference you're in.

00:01:01.944 --> 00:01:04.521
The photon that I emit from my flashlight,

00:01:04.521 --> 00:01:05.705
right at time equals zero,

00:01:05.705 --> 00:01:08.255
well sure I'm going to see that as moving

00:01:08.255 --> 00:01:10.879
at the speed of light in
the positive x direction.

00:01:10.879 --> 00:01:13.410
But my friend, since she's already moving

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.265
in that positive x direction
at half of the speed of light,

00:01:16.265 --> 00:01:18.351
if we assumed a Newtonian world,

00:01:18.351 --> 00:01:21.485
she would see that photon going
at half the speed of light.

00:01:21.485 --> 00:01:26.222
And likewise, if she emitted
a photon from her flashlight,

00:01:26.222 --> 00:01:28.771
to her, it would look like it's
going at the speed of light,

00:01:28.771 --> 00:01:31.789
but to me, it would look
like it's going faster

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:33.577
than the speed of light.

00:01:33.577 --> 00:01:35.779
And the reason why that is a conundrum

00:01:35.779 --> 00:01:39.076
is we know from observation
of the universe around us,

00:01:39.076 --> 00:01:41.699
and this is profound, this
is a little mind-blowing,

00:01:41.699 --> 00:01:44.532
this is counterintuitive
to our everyday experience,

00:01:44.532 --> 00:01:46.506
but we know from observation

00:01:46.506 --> 00:01:49.919
that the speed of light is absolute,

00:01:49.919 --> 00:01:52.914
that it doesn't matter your
inertial frame of reference.

00:01:52.914 --> 00:01:54.725
As long as you're in an
inertial frame of reference,

00:01:54.725 --> 00:01:56.954
it doesn't matter your relative velocity

00:01:56.954 --> 00:01:59.276
relative to another
inertial frame of reference.

00:01:59.276 --> 00:02:01.621
You will always measure the speed of light

00:02:01.621 --> 00:02:04.291
at three times ten to the
eighth meters per second.

00:02:04.291 --> 00:02:06.010
But that's at a direct contradiction

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.424
with what our model just set up.

00:02:08.424 --> 00:02:12.232
So it really forces us to
question all of our assumptions.

00:02:12.232 --> 00:02:14.341
So what are the assumptions that we made

00:02:14.341 --> 00:02:15.896
in this Newtonian world?

00:02:15.896 --> 00:02:19.124
Well, we assumed that time is absolute.

00:02:19.124 --> 00:02:21.190
Time is absolute.

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:22.792
And what do I mean by that?

00:02:22.792 --> 00:02:25.881
Well, we assumed that
one second passing for me

00:02:25.881 --> 00:02:28.667
is going to be one second
passing for my friend.

00:02:28.667 --> 00:02:30.733
That's just our everyday notion.

00:02:30.733 --> 00:02:33.403
If I'm in a car and you're not in a car,

00:02:33.403 --> 00:02:35.958
and we both have watches, and
we synchronize our watches,

00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:38.233
they seem to say synchronized.

00:02:38.233 --> 00:02:42.668
But maybe we need to
loosen this assumption.

00:02:42.668 --> 00:02:45.918
We also assumed that space is absolute.

00:02:45.918 --> 00:02:49.169
Space is absolute.

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:50.539
And what do I mean by that?

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:52.346
Well in our everyday experience,

00:02:52.346 --> 00:02:55.596
regardless of what our relative
frames of reference are,

00:02:55.596 --> 00:02:59.892
we seem to agree that, well if
that meter stick over there,

00:02:59.892 --> 00:03:01.508
that's riding on that train,

00:03:01.508 --> 00:03:03.598
that is a meter stick, whether
I'm sitting on the train

00:03:03.598 --> 00:03:04.852
or whether I'm not.

00:03:04.852 --> 00:03:07.615
But maybe things start to
break down a little bit

00:03:07.615 --> 00:03:11.135
as we think about higher velocities.

00:03:11.135 --> 00:03:13.109
And maybe they break down
even at the slower velocities,

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:14.311
but we just don't notice them

00:03:14.311 --> 00:03:15.983
because it's a very small error.

00:03:15.983 --> 00:03:18.189
And maybe there's something
even more interesting.

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:19.805
In our everyday experience,

00:03:19.805 --> 00:03:23.868
we just assume that time is somehow

00:03:23.868 --> 00:03:26.534
something very different than space,

00:03:26.534 --> 00:03:28.902
that you can move in the time direction

00:03:28.902 --> 00:03:30.411
without moving in the space direction,

00:03:30.411 --> 00:03:32.032
or you can move in the space direction

00:03:32.032 --> 00:03:33.495
without moving in the time direction,

00:03:33.495 --> 00:03:35.724
and that they're independent regardless

00:03:35.724 --> 00:03:38.765
of which inertial frame
of reference you're in.

00:03:38.765 --> 00:03:40.809
But maybe they aren't separate things.

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:45.499
In fact, maybe they're all
one continuum of spacetime,

00:03:45.499 --> 00:03:47.519
and I don't mean space dash time,

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:48.698
I mean spacetime.

00:03:48.698 --> 00:03:53.063
I mean the word spacetime,

00:03:53.063 --> 00:03:54.823
where space and time really
aren't different things.

00:03:54.823 --> 00:03:57.702
It's just one continuum, spacetime.

00:03:57.702 --> 00:03:59.188
And I keep saying it fast like that,

00:03:59.188 --> 00:04:03.623
because it's not space dash time,

00:04:03.623 --> 00:04:05.504
like thinking about the
different dimensions,

00:04:05.504 --> 00:04:07.756
or thinking about two different things.

00:04:07.756 --> 00:04:11.518
We're renaming one thing called spacetime.

00:04:11.518 --> 00:04:13.538
So these are the things
that we're going to start

00:04:13.538 --> 00:04:14.652
to hold into question.

00:04:14.652 --> 00:04:18.158
So what if we loosen these,
and we assume the thing

00:04:18.158 --> 00:04:20.155
that we have observed in the universe,

00:04:20.155 --> 00:04:22.709
that the speed of light is absolute,

00:04:22.709 --> 00:04:26.146
regardless of your inertial
frame of reference.

00:04:26.146 --> 00:04:28.677
So let's word from there, do
a little thought experiment,

00:04:28.677 --> 00:04:31.272
and then think about what type
of a model we can construct,

00:04:31.272 --> 00:04:35.243
in which case the speed
of light is absolute.

00:04:35.243 --> 00:04:36.882
And to do that, we're still going to use

00:04:36.882 --> 00:04:38.275
our little model here,

00:04:38.275 --> 00:04:41.154
and we're going to focus on my
friend's frame of reference,

00:04:41.154 --> 00:04:42.455
my friend who's on a spaceship,

00:04:42.455 --> 00:04:45.259
who right at time equal
zero, is passing me by

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:47.256
at half the speed of light.

00:04:47.256 --> 00:04:50.530
And we assumed that she's
in this train of spaceships.

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:52.496
So we assumed already that she's,

00:04:52.496 --> 00:04:54.081
there are these spaceships
that are all moving

00:04:54.081 --> 00:04:56.793
at half the speed of light
in the positive x direction,

00:04:56.793 --> 00:04:57.954
relative to me,

00:04:57.954 --> 00:05:01.228
and they're all three times
ten to the eighth meters apart.

00:05:01.228 --> 00:05:02.505
So they're like that.

00:05:02.505 --> 00:05:05.593
So let's say, and I
did these axes in blue,

00:05:05.593 --> 00:05:07.242
because we're assuming this is my friend's

00:05:07.242 --> 00:05:08.862
frame of reference, so you could say

00:05:08.862 --> 00:05:10.552
this is the S prime frame of reference,

00:05:10.552 --> 00:05:12.294
this is Sally's frame of reference

00:05:12.294 --> 00:05:14.082
from a couple of videos ago.

00:05:14.082 --> 00:05:16.287
Let's say a second before she gets to me,

00:05:16.287 --> 00:05:18.470
and I'm also assuming, the
way I've drawn these axes,

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:20.420
and we're going to
modify them in the future

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:22.065
where we're actually going
to use the same units

00:05:22.065 --> 00:05:22.831
for space and time.

00:05:22.831 --> 00:05:25.230
Right now, I'm still sticking
to what we've classically done

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:26.669
where we use seconds for time

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:29.595
and meters for our path or our space,

00:05:29.595 --> 00:05:31.754
but in the future, we'll
actually use meters for both.

00:05:31.754 --> 00:05:33.287
But we'll get to that, I don't want to do

00:05:33.287 --> 00:05:34.982
too many things at once.

00:05:34.982 --> 00:05:37.521
But the way I've drawn it

00:05:37.521 --> 00:05:39.672
along my space axis,

00:05:39.672 --> 00:05:41.512
three times ten to the eighth meters

00:05:41.512 --> 00:05:44.484
is going to be the exact
same length as one second,

00:05:44.484 --> 00:05:47.735
and I'm doing that so
that the path of light

00:05:47.735 --> 00:05:49.035
on my diagram

00:05:49.035 --> 00:05:51.659
can be a 45 degree angle.

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:55.165
So this is three times
ten to the eighth meters

00:05:55.165 --> 00:05:56.303
right over there.

00:05:56.303 --> 00:05:59.460
So let's say a second
before Sally gets to me,

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:03.268
she releases a photon from her spaceship

00:06:03.268 --> 00:06:06.264
in the direction of the spaceship
that is in front of her.

00:06:06.264 --> 00:06:07.494
How far is it in front of her?

00:06:07.494 --> 00:06:10.582
It's three times ten to the
eighth meters in front of her.

00:06:10.582 --> 00:06:12.556
And let's say on the
back of that spaceship,

00:06:12.556 --> 00:06:14.413
there is a mirror.

00:06:14.413 --> 00:06:17.385
So she's pointing her
flashlight at that mirror.

00:06:17.385 --> 00:06:19.731
So what's going to happen
from her frame of reference

00:06:19.731 --> 00:06:21.147
after one second?

00:06:21.147 --> 00:06:23.747
So for one second, from
her frame of reference,

00:06:23.747 --> 00:06:26.487
she is stationary, so
this is Sally still here.

00:06:26.487 --> 00:06:30.481
She is going to be still
at x prime equals zero

00:06:30.481 --> 00:06:31.967
in her frame of reference,

00:06:31.967 --> 00:06:34.289
and that ship is still going to be

00:06:34.289 --> 00:06:36.611
three times ten to the eighth
meters in front of her.

00:06:36.611 --> 00:06:39.296
They're all moving, relative
to me, at the same velocity,

00:06:39.296 --> 00:06:41.967
but relative to each other,
they seem to be stationary.

00:06:41.967 --> 00:06:43.963
And so what would be
the path of that photon?

00:06:43.963 --> 00:06:47.117
Well that photon will have
gone from Sally's flashlight

00:06:47.117 --> 00:06:49.137
from her headlamp, or whatever it is,

00:06:49.137 --> 00:06:50.739
to that spaceship in front of her

00:06:50.739 --> 00:06:52.852
would've just reached that mirror

00:06:52.852 --> 00:06:54.872
on the back of that spaceship.

00:06:54.872 --> 00:06:56.928
And so we can draw the path of light.

00:06:56.928 --> 00:06:59.435
It will be, so let me,

00:06:59.435 --> 00:07:01.409
so that path of light

00:07:01.409 --> 00:07:05.328
will look like that on this diagram.

00:07:05.328 --> 00:07:07.070
And then right at this moment,

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:10.599
right at t prime equals zero seconds,

00:07:10.599 --> 00:07:13.943
the photon will be
reflected back to Sally.

00:07:13.943 --> 00:07:16.473
Well how long will it
take to get back to Sally?

00:07:16.473 --> 00:07:19.232
Well Sally's gonna receive
the reflection of that photon

00:07:19.232 --> 00:07:20.904
after one second, because that's how long

00:07:20.904 --> 00:07:21.856
it's going to take it to go

00:07:21.856 --> 00:07:23.545
three times ten to the eighth meters.

00:07:23.545 --> 00:07:26.076
So the path of that very first photon,

00:07:26.076 --> 00:07:28.445
the path of that very first photon

00:07:28.445 --> 00:07:31.417
is going to look like that.

00:07:31.417 --> 00:07:33.483
All right, well hopefully this is pretty

00:07:33.483 --> 00:07:35.317
straightforward here.

00:07:35.317 --> 00:07:37.616
This is what would happen from
Sally's frame of reference.

00:07:37.616 --> 00:07:39.241
A second before she reaches me,

00:07:39.241 --> 00:07:43.096
at t prime equals negative one seconds,

00:07:43.096 --> 00:07:45.836
emits a photon at t equals zero seconds,

00:07:45.836 --> 00:07:47.368
and gets to the spaceship

00:07:47.368 --> 00:07:50.201
that's three times ten to the
eighth meters in front of her,

00:07:50.201 --> 00:07:53.266
essentially one light-second
in front of her,

00:07:53.266 --> 00:07:54.961
and then a second later,

00:07:54.961 --> 00:07:56.934
it's reflecting back, a second later,

00:07:56.934 --> 00:07:58.745
she gets the reflection.

00:07:58.745 --> 00:08:01.416
And so that's what this
diagram is describing.

00:08:01.416 --> 00:08:03.482
But now let's draw it projected on top

00:08:03.482 --> 00:08:05.015
of my frame of reference.

00:08:05.015 --> 00:08:06.501
And this is when things are going to get

00:08:06.501 --> 00:08:09.101
really, really, really,
really interesting.

00:08:09.101 --> 00:08:10.842
So I've drawn my frame of reference here,

00:08:10.842 --> 00:08:13.211
and I've intentionally
not marked off the seconds

00:08:13.211 --> 00:08:14.836
or the meters on my frame of reference,

00:08:14.836 --> 00:08:16.856
because once again,
I'm not going to assume

00:08:16.856 --> 00:08:18.180
that a second in my frame of reference

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:20.858
is a second in hers, or a
meter in my frame of reference

00:08:20.858 --> 00:08:22.736
is a meter in hers.

00:08:22.736 --> 00:08:25.824
I have drawn her t prime
axis at the same angle

00:08:25.824 --> 00:08:27.124
as I did before,

00:08:27.124 --> 00:08:31.396
because for every second

00:08:31.396 --> 00:08:34.136
we move into the future,

00:08:34.136 --> 00:08:37.944
she's going to move half a
light-second in distance,

00:08:37.944 --> 00:08:39.225
in the positive x direction.

00:08:39.225 --> 00:08:41.896
So this slope right here,
one way to think about it,

00:08:41.896 --> 00:08:42.965
the way I've drawn it,

00:08:42.965 --> 00:08:45.276
this is a slope of two.

00:08:47.506 --> 00:08:50.628
For every unit she moves
in the x direction,

00:08:50.628 --> 00:08:54.413
she will move two in the time direction.

00:08:54.413 --> 00:08:55.713
And what we're going to do again

00:08:55.713 --> 00:08:58.030
is assume that on her axis,

00:08:58.030 --> 00:08:59.377
I haven't drawn the x prime axis.

00:08:59.377 --> 00:09:00.626
In fact, this is an
exercise to think about

00:09:00.626 --> 00:09:03.064
where should the x prime axis be.

00:09:03.064 --> 00:09:04.875
Should it be coincident with the x axis

00:09:04.875 --> 00:09:05.757
like we assumed before?

00:09:05.757 --> 00:09:07.518
Or is it going to be in a different place?

00:09:07.518 --> 00:09:10.258
But we're going to assume
that the lengths I draw

00:09:10.258 --> 00:09:12.231
for one second on, let's say,

00:09:12.231 --> 00:09:15.389
in the S prime frame of reference,

00:09:15.389 --> 00:09:17.757
is going to be the same
as the length I would draw

00:09:17.757 --> 00:09:20.126
for three times ten to the eighth meters.

00:09:20.126 --> 00:09:21.240
And we're also going to assume

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:22.564
that the speed of light is absolute,

00:09:22.564 --> 00:09:25.443
so it's always going to
moving at a 45 degree angle

00:09:25.443 --> 00:09:29.297
with respect to either frame of reference.

00:09:29.297 --> 00:09:31.015
So that's where things are going
to get a little bit whacky,

00:09:31.015 --> 00:09:32.989
but let's see what's going to happen.

00:09:32.989 --> 00:09:35.288
So at negative one seconds,

00:09:35.288 --> 00:09:38.585
we still have Sally
turning on her flashlight.

00:09:38.585 --> 00:09:41.487
She wants to bounce it off of
the spaceship in front of her.

00:09:41.487 --> 00:09:44.598
And so that photon's going to
move with the speed of light

00:09:44.598 --> 00:09:46.688
in either frame of reference.

00:09:46.688 --> 00:09:48.453
And so let me draw that.

00:09:48.453 --> 00:09:49.747
Let me draw that,

00:09:49.747 --> 00:09:53.467
so it's going to look like this.

00:09:53.467 --> 00:09:55.960
I'm drawing at a 45 degree angle.

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:57.701
So actually, I don't know
where it gets reflected.

00:09:57.701 --> 00:09:59.861
It's gonna get reflected where
it hits that x prime axis,

00:09:59.861 --> 00:10:01.231
but I don't know where that is.

00:10:01.231 --> 00:10:03.460
But we do know that it
then gets reflected,

00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:06.339
and then it gets back to Sally
at one second in the future.

00:10:06.339 --> 00:10:09.195
So the return path of that photon

00:10:09.195 --> 00:10:11.401
is going to look something

00:10:11.401 --> 00:10:13.397
is going to look something like this.

00:10:13.397 --> 00:10:14.930
And that point that it changes direction,

00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:16.068
I could have,

00:10:16.068 --> 00:10:16.857
let me,

00:10:16.857 --> 00:10:18.357
I could have done it like this,

00:10:18.357 --> 00:10:19.332
whoops,

00:10:19.332 --> 00:10:20.461
I could've done it like this.

00:10:20.461 --> 00:10:22.991
But the interesting point is
where it changes direction

00:10:22.991 --> 00:10:25.308
because that's where that
spaceship in front of her

00:10:25.308 --> 00:10:28.513
must be at that point in spacetime.

00:10:28.513 --> 00:10:30.393
Because now we're going to
start thinking of mixing up

00:10:30.393 --> 00:10:31.601
space and time,

00:10:31.601 --> 00:10:33.783
but I'm not going to get
too much involved in that.

00:10:33.783 --> 00:10:35.641
Now why is this interesting?

00:10:35.641 --> 00:10:38.102
Because from Sally's point of view,

00:10:38.102 --> 00:10:39.704
from Sally's point of view,

00:10:39.704 --> 00:10:44.116
this point here where the
light changes direction,

00:10:44.116 --> 00:10:45.904
from Sally's frame of reference,

00:10:45.904 --> 00:10:50.037
is happening simultaneously
with when she reaches me.

00:10:50.037 --> 00:10:52.928
This is happening at t prime

00:10:52.928 --> 00:10:55.528
is equal to zero for Sally.

00:10:55.528 --> 00:10:59.476
So anything that is t prime
is equal to zero for Sally

00:10:59.476 --> 00:11:02.007
must be on the x prime axis.

00:11:02.007 --> 00:11:05.118
So this must sit on the x prime axis.

00:11:05.118 --> 00:11:06.743
Once again, why do I know that?

00:11:06.743 --> 00:11:08.879
Because everything on the x prime axis,

00:11:08.879 --> 00:11:11.341
any event on the x prime axis,

00:11:11.341 --> 00:11:13.407
let me do it in a different color,

00:11:13.407 --> 00:11:15.984
I keep doing black.

00:11:15.984 --> 00:11:18.771
Any event on the x prime axis

00:11:18.771 --> 00:11:22.184
is going to be at t prime
is equal to zero seconds,

00:11:22.184 --> 00:11:24.088
and from Sally's frame of reference

00:11:24.088 --> 00:11:27.013
is going to be simultaneous
with when she passes me up.

00:11:27.013 --> 00:11:29.591
So based on that, we know
that this is going to be,

00:11:32.467 --> 00:11:34.603
we know that this point,

00:11:34.603 --> 00:11:36.275
which is where Sally is,

00:11:36.275 --> 00:11:38.876
that's going to be the origin
from her frame of reference.

00:11:38.876 --> 00:11:43.078
And we know that this point
sits on the x prime axis,

00:11:43.078 --> 00:11:45.934
so based on that, we can
draw the x prime axis.

00:11:45.934 --> 00:11:47.968
You just need two points to define a line,

00:11:47.968 --> 00:11:50.220
and so let me try to do it.

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:52.727
So let me try to draw.

00:11:52.727 --> 00:11:54.074
I can do a better job than that.

00:11:54.074 --> 00:11:55.792
Let me try to draw

00:11:55.792 --> 00:11:57.186
the x prime axis.

00:11:57.186 --> 00:12:00.204
It's going to look like,

00:12:00.204 --> 00:12:02.108
it's going to look like this.

00:12:02.108 --> 00:12:04.708
That right over there is the x prime axis.

00:12:04.708 --> 00:12:07.704
Now at this point, you should
find this mildly mind-blowing.

00:12:07.704 --> 00:12:10.281
Actually, even more than
mildly mind-blowing.

00:12:10.281 --> 00:12:12.533
'Cause it's saying some
pretty, pretty crazy things.

00:12:12.533 --> 00:12:15.714
First of all, let's just make
sure we know how to read this.

00:12:15.714 --> 00:12:17.270
So for any event,

00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:18.508
and now we're going to start thinking

00:12:18.508 --> 00:12:20.033
in terms of spacetime,

00:12:20.033 --> 00:12:23.385
although I'm still using different
units for space and time,

00:12:23.385 --> 00:12:25.126
but we'll address that in the future.

00:12:25.126 --> 00:12:27.727
If I want to read its coordinates
in my frame of reference,

00:12:27.727 --> 00:12:29.492
well if I want to read its x coordinate,

00:12:29.492 --> 00:12:31.558
I go parallel to the t axis,

00:12:31.558 --> 00:12:33.648
and if I wanna read its t coordinate,

00:12:33.648 --> 00:12:35.645
I go parallel to the x axis.

00:12:35.645 --> 00:12:36.945
But for Sally's frame of reference,

00:12:36.945 --> 00:12:38.617
well I essentially do the same thing.

00:12:38.617 --> 00:12:40.567
If I want its x prime coordinates,

00:12:40.567 --> 00:12:43.585
I go parallel to the t prime axis,

00:12:43.585 --> 00:12:46.163
and if I want the t prime coordinates,

00:12:46.163 --> 00:12:49.971
I go parallel to the x prime axis.

00:12:49.971 --> 00:12:51.805
But what's really interesting,

00:12:51.805 --> 00:12:55.265
and I'll go even deeper into
this into the next videos,

00:12:55.265 --> 00:12:56.621
that moment,

00:12:56.621 --> 00:12:58.920
that moment right over here,

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:01.312
that from Sally's frame of reference,

00:13:01.312 --> 00:13:04.887
it looks like it's simultaneous
with her passing me up.

00:13:04.887 --> 00:13:07.116
It looks like it's happening
at t prime equals zero.

00:13:07.116 --> 00:13:08.742
In fact, it is happening
at t prime equals zero.

00:13:08.742 --> 00:13:09.991
From her frame of reference,

00:13:09.991 --> 00:13:12.057
it's happening at t prime equals zero.

00:13:12.057 --> 00:13:14.054
From our frame of reference,

00:13:14.054 --> 00:13:17.398
it is happening after Sally passes us up.

00:13:17.398 --> 00:13:20.671
Notice, it is happening at t
equals some positive value.

00:13:20.671 --> 00:13:23.239
It's not happening at t equals zero.

00:13:23.239 --> 00:13:25.434
So this is starting to
get a little bit whacky.

00:13:25.434 --> 00:13:30.378
One second, and simultaneous,
time, and space,

00:13:30.378 --> 00:13:33.391
and things being simultaneous,

00:13:33.391 --> 00:13:35.829
we're not going to agree on those,

00:13:35.829 --> 00:13:37.895
depending on which frame
of reference we're in.

00:13:37.895 --> 00:13:41.656
The thing we will agree
on is the speed of light.
