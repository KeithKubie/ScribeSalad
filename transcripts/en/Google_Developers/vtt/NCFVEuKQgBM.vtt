00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:06.300
MALE SPEAKER: Shanghai
GDG is a very

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.370
interesting developer community.

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:09.210
FEMALE SPEAKER: I'm
glad somebody

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.410
has asked this question.

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:11.720
MALE SPEAKER: This is where
the magic happens.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.235
FEMALE SPEAKER: This is
primarily a question and

00:00:13.235 --> 00:00:14.390
answer show, so if any
of you out there

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:15.820
would like to ask questions.

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:25.560
ILYA GRIGORIK: Hello, everyone,
and welcome to our

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.800
first Make The Web
Fast episode.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.400
My name is Ilya Grigorik.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.650
I'm a developer advocate with
the creatively titled Make The

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:34.810
Web Fast team, and with me--

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:36.130
JUSTIN CUTRONI: My name
is Justin Cutroni.

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:37.590
I'm the analytics advocate.

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.520
Slightly different than
a developer advocate.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.780
And I work on the Google
Analytics team.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:42.210
ILYA GRIGORIK: Awesome.

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.910
So Justin, I'm really excited
about our episode today

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.690
because I think it covers two
topics that are the most near

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.260
and dear to my heart,
which is web

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.760
performance and web analytics.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.170
And I don't say those just
because I think Google

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.720
Analytics is awesome--
which it is--

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.940
but also because anytime
you talk about the web

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.220
optimization field or any sort
of optimization, you really

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.380
have to have good tools.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.730
You have to measure, and you
have to understand and

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:12.940
quantify what it is that
you're trying to do.

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.880
Otherwise you're just
working in the dark.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:15.260
JUSTIN CUTRONI: Yeah.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.250
I'm really excited, because
we're going to hopefully tell

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.280
people how to make their
businesses better and their

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.160
websites better.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.420
ILYA GRIGORIK: Right.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.030
And I guess that's the other
component, right?

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.460
Like us developers like to
optimize our sites to go

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.840
faster and faster, but at a
certain point, you have to ask

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.050
the question of how
does it relate to

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.870
the business as well?

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:31.860
JUSTIN CUTRONI: Dollars
and cents.

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.000
ILYA GRIGORIK: Dollars
and cents, right.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.500
So hopefully you'll
keep us honest.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.090
JUSTIN CUTRONI: We'll try.

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.180
ILYA GRIGORIK: Also, I think
it's a very good episode to

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.920
kick off our series with
because, as I mentioned, you

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.800
really need to have
good tools.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.060
And Google Analytics gives you
a lot of power, and that's

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.980
what we're going to
talk about today.

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:55.220
So there are three broad topics
that I want to make

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:56.580
sure that we cover today.

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.530
The first one is just
what are the tools?

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.455
What do we mean by web
performance optimization?

00:02:01.455 --> 00:02:04.260
And what are the metrics
that we need to track?

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:09.630
The second one is real user
measurement, which is perhaps

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.810
a very obvious concept to a
lot of people in analytic

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.700
space, but perhaps not so
obvious to people like

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.190
developers, just because we
haven't had access to a lot of

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.950
this data in the past.

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.350
And then the last one is,
of course, to tie it all

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:21.580
together, Google Analytics.

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:22.000
JUSTIN CUTRONI: Yep.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.430
And I'll cover that part.

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.140
We'll talk about the business,
and how all of these great

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.290
technical things that Ilya's
going to tell you about in

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.170
terms of speed and performance
optimization can be measured

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.300
in terms of dollars and cents,
literally, for your business.

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.760
ILYA GRIGORIK: Right.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:35.060
OK.

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.940
So with that, we do have
some slides that

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.040
we're going to go through.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.910
Just a little bit
of housekeeping.

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.960
You can find both Justin and
myself on Google Plus, so you

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.670
can ask us questions during the
event or after the event,

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.830
and we'll make sure to answer
your questions.

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.670
And also, throughout the slide
deck, you'll see the goo.gl

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.060
link at the bottom.

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.910
You can head there, and
there's a moderator--

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.970
it's a Google Moderator page
there, so you can actually

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.390
submit your questions,
and we'll do some

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:03.730
questions at the end.

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.980
We may not get to all of them,
but we'll try our best.

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.810
All right, so let's
get right into it.

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:11.850
Lots of stuff to cover.

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:16.440
So I'll start with the most
obvious thing that I think

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.760
needs to be put up front, which
is just your typical

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:19.540
development cycle.

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:19.750
Right?

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:25.150
So as a web designer, website
owner, you usually go through

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:26.370
three typical steps, right?

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.460
You write code, or you
optimize your page.

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:30.590
You test it, hopefully.

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.390
Hopefully you have things like
unit tests, integration tests,

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.500
to make sure that your sites are
broken, given the updates.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.020
You may even have performance
or regression tests.

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:43.400
So perhaps a new feature that
you have introduced--

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.300
is it causing some other
behaviors that may

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:47.360
slow down your site?

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.210
That's a good thing to catch.

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:52.170
Visual inspection and Q&amp;A. So I
think a lot of people today

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.640
depend on Q and A, just
in terms of like,

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:55.540
does my site work?

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.380
Does it work fast enough?

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.780
But here's the trick, at
least in my experience.

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.890
Then I deploy my code, and maybe
it just says more about

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.480
my development skills than
anything else, but whenever I

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.230
deploy my code, then I get a
bunch of phone calls or emails

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.970
and stuff like this, which just
says, like, oh, yeah,

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.880
that's cool that it works
for you, but it

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:14.950
doesn't work for me.

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.149
Or for some reason, it
just feels slower.

00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:20.579
Which is even worse, because
when something is broken, you

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:21.839
can at least say
what is broken.

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:23.770
When something is just slow,
it's like, well, there's a

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:26.880
million things that could
have gone wrong, right?

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.090
And the one thing that I've
learned over time is my

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.950
computer, and my device, is
completely different from my

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:34.660
customer's device.

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.020
This may seem completely
obvious, but I think it's

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.640
worth stating.

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.070
And there's a huge, huge
number of factors

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.890
that go into this.

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:45.770
So, first of all, I may be
testing my new site on a

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.670
Chrome book or my desktop
computer, and you're trying to

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:50.930
access the site on your
mobile phone.

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:51.160
All right?

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.870
Two completely different classes
of devices, different

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:57.850
CPU power, amount of memory,
even the network, right?

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:01.010
So loading a bunch of images on
my desktop computer may not

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.650
be a big deal.

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.830
But loading the same images
on a mobile connection may

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:06.600
actually be pretty painful.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:10.290
So the one thing that I've
learned, and I think that the

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:13.500
web optimization community at
large is working on today, is

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:18.820
making sure that we measure
real performance from real

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:22.310
users as they interact with your
real site on real network

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:23.280
conditions.

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:26.040
That's a lot of reals
in there.

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:27.600
Keeping it real.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.440
So because of that,
we invented RUM.

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.640
Except not this kind of rum.

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.860
And we didn't really invent it,
because all it stands for

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.040
is Real User Measurement,
right?

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.500
And this is what I mean by,
this may seem completely

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.620
obvious to somebody in the
analytics space, because it's

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:42.970
like, of course.

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:43.910
How else do you get the data?

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:46.370
You gather it from
the real users.

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:50.090
But in the context of web
performance, or any sort of

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:53.170
performance optimization,
historically, we relied on

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:55.210
synthetic testing.

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:58.620
So I would do a benchmark on my
own computer, or set up a

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:02.920
test that will perhaps even hit
my website from different

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:04.560
geographic locations
in the world.

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:08.820
But the key point there is, it's
not based on real user

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:12.380
behavior, or even real user
browsers and all these things.

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:14.840
That type of data has been
actually very hard to gather,

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:18.300
because we haven't had the
tools to actually get the

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:20.060
performance data from
our browser.

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:22.045
Like how long did it take to
connect to the server, and all

00:06:22.045 --> 00:06:23.270
of these things?

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:25.590
So that's what Real User
Measurement is all about, and

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:29.910
you guys can find this acronym
RUM in a lot of places as you

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:34.060
get kind of deeper into the
web performance field.

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:39.130
So the good news is, there's
been a lot of work and effort

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:43.140
put together by the W3C web
performance working group.

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:46.460
So the group started about two
years ago, and they've been

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:48.570
working on a number of different
new specifications

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:52.530
and APIs to enable better tools,
and just better browser

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:53.650
performance.

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:57.480
And specifically, they come up
with this really scary looking

00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:02.080
diagram here, which is the
W3C navigation spec.

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:06.530
Now, there's a lot of labels in
here, and the labels don't

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:08.840
really matter for the purposes
of our discussion.

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:11.570
What is important, though,
is the three colors

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:13.740
that we have in here.

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:17.020
The first one is the green one,
which is the network.

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:19.090
And then you have the server
and the browser.

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:22.030
And what this tells you is for
any page that you load in the

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:24.130
browser, there are three
broad components

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:25.570
that come into play.

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:28.000
First of all, there's is the
network, which is how are you

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:28.950
accessing the page?

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:32.460
So me accessing the page on my
mobile phone versus my desktop

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:35.800
computer are two entirely
different experiences, and a

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:39.260
lot of that is due to different
network conditions.

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:40.280
Then there's the server.

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:42.590
So the server can be
really fast, or it

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:44.760
can be kind of slow.

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:46.440
Never happen to me.

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:50.680
And then the last one is the
browser, which is, once the

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:53.020
server sends all of this data
and delivers it over the

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:54.850
network, the browser actually
needs to interpret all of

00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:57.070
those data and kind of lay
it out on the screen.

00:07:57.070 --> 00:07:58.610
And increasingly, we're
putting more and more

00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:01.960
JavaScript into our pages to
make it more interactive.

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:04.180
So that stuff also takes time.

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:07.320
So really, all of these black
labels in here, what they tell

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:10.260
you is, for each of these
labels, the browser actually

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:14.440
captures a time stamp when the
page is rendered, and it

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:17.280
allows us to introspect into
this entire workflow for any

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:20.300
page and see how long
each step took.

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:20.580
Right?

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:25.030
So this is really awesome,
because up until maybe a year

00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:26.930
ago, we didn't even have
this capability.

00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:29.620
The only thing we could measure,
at best, is some

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:32.530
timing in the browser, but we
didn't see or didn't have any

00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:35.280
visibility into the network.

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:39.669
So the cool thing is, if you're
using Chrome, Firefox,

00:08:39.669 --> 00:08:44.570
or IE, you can actually open
your developer tools, and type

00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:46.920
in your console, performance
and timing.

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:48.940
And you'll get this
object back.

00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:51.740
And some of these
labels here--

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:52.910
actually, all of them--

00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:54.580
correspond to the labels
that we saw on

00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:56.210
the previous diagram.

00:08:56.210 --> 00:08:59.210
And you know the W3C guys are
serious about web performance,

00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:01.980
because they actually went for
the microsecond granularity.

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:03.560
Not even milliseconds.

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:04.350
Forget milliseconds.

00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:07.590
We're optimizing at microsecond
level here.

00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:11.290
And so you can open this console
on any web page that

00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:13.890
you're browsing currently
and type this in.

00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:16.760
And these are the stats
for your connection.

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:17.800
For your browser.

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:18.000
Right?

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.450
This is not some generic number
that's coming from the

00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:23.610
server itself.

00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:25.780
So that's the big change.

00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:27.720
Up until very recently,
we just didn't have

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:28.580
access to this data.

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:30.990
And when I say we, as
in web developers.

00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:36.990
So the good news is that
navigation timing is now

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:39.160
supported in more than
half of all the

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:41.310
browsers, so about 64%.

00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:43.360
Chrome, Firefox, IE--

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:47.500
we have growing support for
mobile browsers as well, so we

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:50.330
have Android browsers,
Chrome, and Firefox.

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:53.770
The one omission right now is
the Safari browsers, so I

00:09:53.770 --> 00:09:55.210
think they're catching
up at this point.

00:09:55.210 --> 00:09:58.790
But the point is, it's not 100%
deployed yet, but it's

00:09:58.790 --> 00:09:59.750
getting there.

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:02.120
So that's the good news.

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:05.300
And the reason I think this is
important, and why RUM real

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:10.840
user measurement is important,
is it's great to read the

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:14.770
latest in terms of top 10
things you should do to

00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:19.260
optimize your site, or the top
10 performance improvements.

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.330
But frankly, your site
is different.

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:23.100
Your audience may be different,
and your goals may

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:24.300
be different.

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:26.220
It may not actually
matter to you.

00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:29.770
So what these metrics allow you
to do is actually measure

00:10:29.770 --> 00:10:32.370
all those things with respect
to your goals.

00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:35.650
Like, is it even worth that
I spend half a day

00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:37.950
micro-optimizing this
specific thing?

00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:40.720
Because maybe if it doesn't make
a bottom line impact on

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:44.480
my business, maybe I should work
on my marketing instead.

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:44.880
JUSTIN CUTRONI: Yeah.

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:46.650
You have to take it with
a grain of salt, right?

00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:49.280
You need to be able to compare
the benefit of every

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:50.250
optimization.

00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:51.080
ILYA GRIGORIK: Exactly.

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:51.370
Right.

00:10:51.370 --> 00:10:54.210
So that's the key aspect here.

00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:57.380
So how do we collect navigation
timing data?

00:10:57.380 --> 00:11:00.350
Remember that this data is
available in the browser, so

00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:01.970
during each session.

00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:05.510
And that's where Google
Analytics comes in.

00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:09.600
And the cool thing about this is
there's just 10 easy steps

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:12.140
to get navigation timing
working with GA.

00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:14.465
The first step is you log in
to your existing Google

00:11:14.465 --> 00:11:17.630
Analytics account, and the
second is you navigate to the

00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:19.530
site speed overview.

00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:21.470
And actually, at that
point, you're done.

00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:23.140
So I'm just using
binary notation.

00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:25.480
JUSTIN CUTRONI: You pulled the
super nerd trick, didn't you?

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:25.620
ILYA GRIGORIK: Yes.

00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:26.550
JUSTIN CUTRONI: You
went there.

00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:27.280
ILYA GRIGORIK: Yes.

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:28.780
I thought was funny when I
was making the slides.

00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:30.810
JUSTIN CUTRONI: Well, you
bring up a great point.

00:11:30.810 --> 00:11:33.620
Really, the nice thing about
having that specification is

00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:35.520
because all that data is already
in the browser, Google

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:37.710
Analytics can collect
it automatically.

00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:39.820
So there's already
reports built.

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:41.890
You don't need to do anything
special other than use your

00:11:41.890 --> 00:11:43.620
Google Analytics account, and
just log in, and you're going

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:44.430
to have this data.

00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:44.616
ILYA GRIGORIK: Yeah.

00:11:44.616 --> 00:11:47.160
This is why I love talking about
this stuff, because--

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:47.860
JUSTIN CUTRONI: It's
just there.

00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:49.490
ILYA GRIGORIK: I always start
the conversation with, like,

00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:53.020
here is all the things you
need to do to enable

00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:55.120
navigation timing or
gather this data.

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:57.190
And oh, by the way, you
already have it.

00:11:57.190 --> 00:12:01.187
So after you finish listening to
this webcast, you can turn

00:12:01.187 --> 00:12:03.575
around to your coworker and be
like, hey, I just set up real

00:12:03.575 --> 00:12:04.000
user measurement.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.570
JUSTIN CUTRONI: Actually, you
could just do it right now.

00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:07.810
You could listen to us, and
you could be in Google

00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:10.220
Analytics in another monitor,
or on another screen.

00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:12.730
That would be even cooler.

00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:15.610
ILYA GRIGORIK: So Google
Analytics automatically

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:16.900
collects all this
data for you.

00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:18.060
You don't have to do anything.

00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:20.820
There's one caveat, and we'll
get back to it in a second,

00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:24.200
but let's go and do
an actual demo.

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:26.290
JUSTIN CUTRONI: Let's
look at some data.

00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:30.750
ILYA GRIGORIK: So let me just
switch to our tab over here.

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:33.720
So this is my own personal
account.

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:35.330
This is data for my own blog.

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:39.960
And what you see here is I just
went into content, site

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:41.070
speed, and overview.

00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:41.360
Right?

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:43.510
So I'm just looking at
my regular profile.

00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:45.140
And we're looking at about--

00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:46.610
well, the last 30
days of data.

00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:49.440
July 14th to today.

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:52.720
So you can see that over the
last 30 days, I've had 50,000

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:54.170
page views.

00:12:54.170 --> 00:12:57.820
And this graph right here shows
you the average page

00:12:57.820 --> 00:12:58.420
loading time.

00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:01.440
So this is gathered through
navigation timing.

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:06.030
And average page loading time
is the time when the spinner

00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:07.970
stops on your browser.

00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:09.150
JUSTIN CUTRONI: It's
pretty detailed.

00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:09.400
ILYA GRIGORIK: Yeah.

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:10.490
There's many different ways.

00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:12.270
I think it's important
to define

00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:14.130
when the page is loaded.

00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:16.140
You don't have to wait for the
spinner to stop, because

00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:18.735
oftentimes the content's already
visible, and you can

00:13:18.735 --> 00:13:20.040
start interacting with it.

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:22.210
But that's what this specific
metric tells you.

00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:24.700
JUSTIN CUTRONI: And this is a
great point to stop for a

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:27.190
second and say that we have a
lot of different metrics in

00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:28.810
here that are collected
from the browser.

00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:31.370
They match up perfectly with
that diagram that Ilya

00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:35.380
provided about the various
points from server to network

00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:36.330
to browser.

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:38.670
And so if you are looking for
a definition, we have a help

00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:41.430
center for Google Analytics that
defines what all of our

00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:44.530
metrics are so that you can get
detailed information about

00:13:44.530 --> 00:13:46.870
what does this metric mean in
terms of time measurement in

00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:49.200
my browser versus time
measurement at the server

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:52.270
level versus time measurement
about some network attribute?

00:13:52.270 --> 00:13:52.610
ILYA GRIGORIK: Yep.

00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:55.790
And it's very useful to actually
then go back to that

00:13:55.790 --> 00:14:00.220
kind of scary-looking diagram
and just see where or at which

00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:02.680
point each one of these labels
correspond to because I think

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:06.250
that really helps you build a
visual model of like, where is

00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:07.872
my problem, if you will?

00:14:07.872 --> 00:14:09.540
Where is the performance
bottleneck?

00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:12.820
So on the overview page, you
just get a quick summary of

00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:13.630
the key metrics.

00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:17.110
Things like the domain look-up
time or the DNS time that it

00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:19.010
took to resolve your site.

00:14:19.010 --> 00:14:22.850
So perhaps your DNS provider is
not very good, as in it's

00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:23.480
slow, right?

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:24.570
So that would show up here.

00:14:24.570 --> 00:14:27.950
And that's a very good sign that
you may want to look into

00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:29.590
a different provider.

00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:30.780
Server response time.

00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:34.420
So this is interesting because
I think this comes as news to

00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:35.130
a lot of people.

00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:36.530
It's like, Google Analytics
can measure my

00:14:36.530 --> 00:14:37.990
server response time?

00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:39.960
I thought I had to look
at my logs for that.

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:43.060
It's like, well, not anymore,
because we have this data,

00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:43.990
which is great.

00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:46.610
And we also have
other metrics.

00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:49.050
So this is the high
level overview.

00:14:49.050 --> 00:14:52.850
We can also go and drill down
into the page timings.

00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:57.000
So in here, because Google
Analytics collects the data on

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.550
per-page level, you actually
get all this data in any

00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:02.830
granularity that you want.

00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:05.690
So we were just looking
at your global stats

00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:06.860
for the last 30 days.

00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:09.690
You can also drill down into
any specific page here.

00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:13.610
So, for example, this latency
post that I published a few

00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:14.430
weeks back, right?

00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:16.900
It had 13,000 page views, and
you can see that on average,

00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:20.070
it took about six seconds
to load this page.

00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:22.220
Pretty slow.

00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:23.920
JUSTIN CUTRONI: And so for all
of you folks that are not

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:26.370
familiar with analytics, we just
call this drilling down

00:15:26.370 --> 00:15:27.390
segmentation.

00:15:27.390 --> 00:15:30.070
And so what we're doing is we're
taking that top level

00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:33.000
number, and we're kind of going
into it to look at one

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.150
smaller piece and understand
how that smaller piece is

00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:35.920
performing.

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:39.230
And that's a critical, critical
thing in analytics

00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:42.980
because making these incremental
changes ultimately

00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:45.470
adds to a bigger benefit
to your website.

00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:45.910
ILYA GRIGORIK: Right.

00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:46.420
Exactly.

00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:48.790
So in here, we can
also drill in.

00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:52.070
So we're looking at page views,
average page load

00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:53.780
time-- but what about
the other metrics?

00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:56.490
So you can go into the technical
drill down here.

00:15:56.490 --> 00:15:57.530
JUSTIN CUTRONI: You
want technical?

00:15:57.530 --> 00:15:58.340
We've got technical.

00:15:58.340 --> 00:15:58.970
ILYA GRIGORIK: Yeah, we've
got technical.

00:15:58.970 --> 00:16:00.340
That's for sure.

00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:05.680
And you see just for this
specific page, averages for

00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:09.670
loading time, redirection
time, look up times, 50

00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:10.660
different times.

00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:13.450
And then you can graph, or you
can compare these metrics

00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:16.610
against any other metric that
you have in Google Analytics,

00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:18.070
which is really cool.

00:16:18.070 --> 00:16:23.530
So we're looking at all pages
versus any specific page.

00:16:23.530 --> 00:16:25.840
So that's kind of
one first tip.

00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:32.250
Now, the second one is, let's
go into performance here.

00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:35.400
So averages are very good and
useful, but they can be

00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:35.980
misleading.

00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:36.660
JUSTIN CUTRONI: Absolutely.

00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:38.640
ILYA GRIGORIK: Especially
when you talk about web

00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:39.790
performance.

00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:44.290
Because what you find is,
you'll get skewed

00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:45.350
distributions.

00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:47.040
You have kind of peaks
and valleys.

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:49.100
And when you just compute
an average of it, it may

00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:50.510
completely hide the
entire story.

00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:52.390
JUSTIN CUTRONI: It's like the
average net worth of me and

00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:54.180
Bill Gates is--

00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:57.450
well, Bill kind of skews that
average higher than-- you

00:16:57.450 --> 00:16:58.860
know, or I bring
it down lower.

00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:00.093
Whichever way you want
to look at it.

00:17:00.093 --> 00:17:01.560
But the outliers skew things.

00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:02.000
ILYA GRIGORIK: Exactly.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.980
So the histograms allow you to
actually see the underlying

00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:07.970
distribution of the data.

00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:09.940
So you can see here, we're
looking at the

00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:11.290
page loading time.

00:17:11.290 --> 00:17:12.920
And within the page
loading time, we

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:14.450
have different buckets.

00:17:14.450 --> 00:17:21.560
So 33% of all the users loaded
the page in sub 1 second.

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:24.490
And we can actually expand this
bucket even further and

00:17:24.490 --> 00:17:27.640
look as to what the
breakdown is here.

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:30.520
43% loaded the page in within
one to three seconds.

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:32.270
So this is very useful
information.

00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:36.430
And you can do this sort of
drill down for any specific

00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:38.040
metric in here.

00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:40.520
And I'll show you guys a side
by side comparison of one

00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:44.910
specific case, which I think
is really important.

00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:47.550
So let me go back to
this next tab.

00:17:47.550 --> 00:17:52.970
So what you're looking at here
is my site, and the data is

00:17:52.970 --> 00:17:54.620
from January 1 to January 31.

00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:56.310
So we actually went
back in time.

00:17:56.310 --> 00:17:59.980
And the reason I'm showing this
is it just so happens

00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:02.520
that on December 31--

00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:05.050
that's what I do, I guess,
on my holidays--

00:18:05.050 --> 00:18:07.620
I completely migrated
my site to a

00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:08.910
different hosting provider.

00:18:08.910 --> 00:18:12.470
I completely rewrote how the
data's served and everything.

00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:14.580
I guess that's my holiday.

00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:19.040
And I know that I made that
cut-off on December 31.

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:22.090
So what I want to show you
here is, this is the data

00:18:22.090 --> 00:18:24.160
after I migrated.

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:27.875
Now, let's select this, and I'll
do compare to the past.

00:18:27.875 --> 00:18:31.270
So I want to compare January
to December.

00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:33.360
Did all this work that I did--

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:37.700
do, I guess-- on December 31
amount to much, or not?

00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:42.640
So I'll compare this, and now
we have two lines here.

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:44.595
It may not be immediately
obvious what the difference

00:18:44.595 --> 00:18:46.470
is, but now look
at the metrics.

00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:50.840
My average page loading
time went down by 25%.

00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:54.150
My server response
time went by 76%.

00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:54.640
JUSTIN CUTRONI: Awesome.

00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:54.910
ILYA GRIGORIK: Yeah.

00:18:54.910 --> 00:18:57.510
So this is a huge improvement.

00:18:57.510 --> 00:19:00.040
I can actually show you the
data and quantify it, and

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:01.160
everything's green.

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:04.770
So to me, this is like,
huge success.

00:19:04.770 --> 00:19:06.270
JUSTIN CUTRONI: And the
measurement was easy, right?

00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:07.370
What did you have to do to--

00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:07.550
I didn't have to do anything.

00:19:07.550 --> 00:19:09.190
JUSTIN CUTRONI: You didn't
have to do anything.

00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:09.990
That's the best part.

00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:10.680
ILYA GRIGORIK: Yep.

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:11.390
That's the best part.

00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:11.850
Exactly.

00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:15.580
So let me just go back here.

00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:19.420
So as I was exploring these
reports, frankly, I didn't

00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:21.140
even realize that Google
Analytics was collecting this

00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:22.160
data at first.

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:23.290
And then I found these things,
and I was like,

00:19:23.290 --> 00:19:25.050
wow, this is awesome.

00:19:25.050 --> 00:19:29.760
But the light bulb moment for
me was not when I was just

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:31.570
browsing through these reports,
but when I realized

00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:34.980
that I have all the power
of Google Analytics.

00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:39.430
So, as an example, we can look
at the map overlay here.

00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:42.130
And what this shows you is for
every visitor that comes to my

00:19:42.130 --> 00:19:45.570
site, Google Analytics collects
geo information.

00:19:45.570 --> 00:19:47.980
And we can then cross-reference
that.

00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:51.570
So it may be a little bit hard
to see, but the colors on the

00:19:51.570 --> 00:19:55.700
map here correspond to the
amount of time that it took to

00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:57.600
load the page.

00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:59.310
So there's a couple of
countries in here--

00:19:59.310 --> 00:20:01.630
specifically Iraq and Syria--

00:20:01.630 --> 00:20:06.610
where, on average, the pages
take 105 seconds to load.

00:20:06.610 --> 00:20:07.590
JUSTIN CUTRONI: That's
a long time.

00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:08.180
ILYA GRIGORIK: Yeah.

00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:10.410
I don't think I've ever
waited 105 seconds

00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:11.780
for a page to load.

00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:17.300
So what this tells me is most
likely, there's some asset on

00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:20.790
my site, or some JavaScript
resource that is probably even

00:20:20.790 --> 00:20:23.080
just blocked.

00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:26.570
And because of that, the
user gets a blank page.

00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:29.390
Then that thing times out, and
then they get the page, which

00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:30.550
is a terrible experience.

00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:31.320
JUSTIN CUTRONI: Very bad.

00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:31.750
ILYA GRIGORIK: Right?

00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:33.740
So that's something for
me to look into.

00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:36.530
But now let's go back here.

00:20:36.530 --> 00:20:43.220
You're looking at the page views
here, which is sort of

00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:43.630
what I want.

00:20:43.630 --> 00:20:47.410
Let me go back to overview.

00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:49.630
So we have average
page load time.

00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:54.230
Now, advanced segments is like,
oh my god moment for me.

00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:54.460
JUSTIN CUTRONI: Yeah.

00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:56.300
If you've never used Analytics,
advanced segments

00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:58.440
is one of the most powerful
features of this tool, where

00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:01.950
you can basically segment the
data in real time, right?

00:21:01.950 --> 00:21:04.920
And segmentation is similar to
filtering, but you could say,

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:07.540
show me all mobile traffic, and
Google Analytics will, in

00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:09.400
real time, filter your
data for you.

00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:12.870
Or show me all my mobile traffic
coming from Syria, or

00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:15.630
show me all my mobile traffic
coming from North America.

00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:20.050
So you can pretty much drill
into the data almost an

00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:22.020
infinite number of ways in
order to analyze the

00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:24.530
performance of certain segments
of your traffic,

00:21:24.530 --> 00:21:26.140
which is really valuable
here, right?

00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:26.500
ILYA GRIGORIK: Yep.

00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:27.000
Exactly.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.840
And so the key point here is,
you don't need to know these

00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:31.400
things up front.

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:32.670
You can just apply this stuff.

00:21:32.670 --> 00:21:36.850
So, for example, I want to
compare the average page

00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:39.450
loading time between, let's say,
North and South America

00:21:39.450 --> 00:21:41.180
versus Asia.

00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:43.960
So I have already created
a custom segment called

00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:46.840
Americas, which stands
for North and South.

00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:49.350
Now what I want is
Asia as well.

00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:53.520
So to do that, I'll create a new
custom segment, and I'll

00:21:53.520 --> 00:22:04.035
do a continent containing
Asia, and I'll name

00:22:04.035 --> 00:22:08.450
it, and I'll save.

00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:11.590
OK.

00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:16.030
So we've created the segment,
and I'll just

00:22:16.030 --> 00:22:17.840
compare it to this guy.

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:19.090
Apply.

00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:22.270
And look at that.

00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:23.520
There's a huge difference.

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:26.350
Turns out there's a huge
difference between users

00:22:26.350 --> 00:22:28.910
coming from Asia and
users coming from

00:22:28.910 --> 00:22:30.150
North or South America.

00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:32.780
And that makes sense, because
my server happens to be

00:22:32.780 --> 00:22:37.280
located about 200 miles from
where we're sitting here in

00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:40.680
California, so it makes sense
that users in North America

00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:42.040
get a faster experience.

00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:43.560
JUSTIN CUTRONI: And what's
interesting is, remember, all

00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:46.270
of these metrics tell you a
different part of the story in

00:22:46.270 --> 00:22:48.780
terms of a page loading
in someone's browser.

00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:50.460
Part of the story is what's
happening at the network

00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:52.290
level, part of the story is
what's happening at the sever

00:22:52.290 --> 00:22:54.280
level, and part of the story
is what's happening in the

00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:55.130
browser level.

00:22:55.130 --> 00:22:58.290
So Ilya, you may have a really
long time for the page to

00:22:58.290 --> 00:23:00.820
load, but your server response
might be fast, or the DNS

00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:02.080
lookup might be fast.

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:03.970
So that gives you tips
into what the

00:23:03.970 --> 00:23:05.150
optimization might be.

00:23:05.150 --> 00:23:07.690
Like you mentioned before, it
might be, I need to get a

00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:10.470
better DNS provider so the
lookup happens faster.

00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:13.160
Or if it's your page is really
crappy and it takes a lot of

00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:15.280
time to render in the browser,
that's something that you can

00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:16.040
go ahead and work on.

00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:18.180
ILYA GRIGORIK: You can do
a ton of forensics.

00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:20.380
So for example, here you
have this giant spike.

00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:22.320
And the natural question
would be, well, why

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:24.000
did it take 16 seconds?

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.120
So maybe I can create a new
segment, mobile versus desktop

00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:30.890
in Asia, and kind of just
drill in and find

00:23:30.890 --> 00:23:33.010
out the root cause.

00:23:33.010 --> 00:23:34.000
JUSTIN CUTRONI: More
segmentation.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:34.740
ILYA GRIGORIK: Yep.

00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:37.400
It's what it's all about.

00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:41.140
So we already talked
about this.

00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:41.800
Just a quick note.

00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:44.040
So this is a side by side
comparison between December

00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:44.510
and January.

00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:47.830
This is what I meant by
averages can lie.

00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:50.080
You have two completely
different kind of bimodal

00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:51.510
distributions here.

00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:54.740
So make sure to pay attention
to these things.

00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:56.860
JUSTIN CUTRONI: So this
has been awesome.

00:23:56.860 --> 00:23:59.950
And you guys don't know Ilya,
Ilya is like, performance

00:23:59.950 --> 00:24:00.830
super nerd.

00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:01.630
Loves this stuff.

00:24:01.630 --> 00:24:03.280
And he makes it contagious.

00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:05.750
I'm actually doing a whole bunch
of speed optimization on

00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:07.500
my own website now.

00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:10.670
But in my work in analytics,
I talk to a

00:24:10.670 --> 00:24:11.460
lot of business people.

00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:15.980
A lot of marketers, a lot of
advertisers who are happy to

00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:18.640
talk to Ilya and hear about this
amazing speed stuff, but

00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:21.480
they're like, yeah, I need
to make some money.

00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:24.580
So the best part about analytics
is, it's all about

00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:25.810
your business, right?

00:24:25.810 --> 00:24:29.200
And in Google Analytics, we
really stress to people that

00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:32.030
you have to measure what's
important to your business.

00:24:32.030 --> 00:24:34.380
What is the desired outcome
that you have?

00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:37.040
Whether it's on your desktop
website or your mobile website

00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:40.530
or even your app, we want you
to think about what am I

00:24:40.530 --> 00:24:41.230
trying to do?

00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:45.570
What is the core business
objective of my site, my

00:24:45.570 --> 00:24:47.370
mobile site, or my app?

00:24:47.370 --> 00:24:50.150
And when you boil down the
entire internet, there's

00:24:50.150 --> 00:24:52.460
really only five types
of business models.

00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:54.890
I might be trying to sell a
product, generate some type of

00:24:54.890 --> 00:24:57.990
lead, I may be a publisher
trying to generate revenue

00:24:57.990 --> 00:25:02.160
from ads, I may be trying to
provide support to a group, or

00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:04.530
I might be out there trying
to build my brand.

00:25:04.530 --> 00:25:07.840
And so with Google Analytics,
we can track all of those

00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:09.320
different types of objectives.

00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:11.270
And we use a feature
called Goals.

00:25:11.270 --> 00:25:13.620
The really, really important
thing is that you take the

00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:17.290
time to sit down and define
what is your objective and

00:25:17.290 --> 00:25:19.980
what are your goals and make
sure you configure Google

00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:21.700
Analytics in order to
track those things.

00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:24.000
Because if you don't, you're
really just tracking a whole

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:27.010
bunch of data that, while it is
useful, it doesn't help you

00:25:27.010 --> 00:25:29.500
understand the impact
to your business.

00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:32.040
So we've got a whole bunch of
videos on the Google Analytics

00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:35.810
YouTube channel about how to set
up goals in your account.

00:25:35.810 --> 00:25:38.390
And what I want to do here is
tell you a little bit about

00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:41.530
how you can configure Google
Analytics to take the awesome

00:25:41.530 --> 00:25:44.850
speed data that Ilya showed you
and compare it to some of

00:25:44.850 --> 00:25:47.890
the conversion data and revenue
data that you can

00:25:47.890 --> 00:25:50.070
collect with Google Analytics.

00:25:50.070 --> 00:25:51.250
And why are we doing this?

00:25:51.250 --> 00:25:54.230
Well, again, you talk to the
speed guys, and their

00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:56.930
objective is they want
to make the web fast.

00:25:56.930 --> 00:25:59.300
And there's a good reason to do
that, because there's been

00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:04.480
a lot of studies that show the
slower your website is, the

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:06.090
lower your conversion
rate's going to be.

00:26:06.090 --> 00:26:09.500
The more trouble your website
visitors are going to have in

00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:12.320
reaching their objective, or
your business objective,

00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:13.820
whether that's buying
a product or

00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:15.210
submitting a lead form.

00:26:15.210 --> 00:26:17.630
And so there's been a number of
studies by companies like

00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:21.910
Gomez and Akamai and Tagman
that have shown a drop-in

00:26:21.910 --> 00:26:24.350
conversion rate the longer
it takes for pages to

00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:25.650
render on your site.

00:26:25.650 --> 00:26:26.940
And again, it's not
just render.

00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:28.990
You have to kind of think of
that whole process of the

00:26:28.990 --> 00:26:32.580
network, the server, and the
browser generating that page

00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:33.460
for the visitor.

00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:37.080
So there is financial proof
here, conversion proof, that

00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:40.280
if you speed things up, you're
going to do better.

00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:41.660
You're going to create a better
experience for your

00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:44.320
website visitors, and ultimately
that's going to

00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:47.650
lead to an increase in
business for you.

00:26:47.650 --> 00:26:49.890
So how might we do some
of these things?

00:26:49.890 --> 00:26:53.900
Well, the reports that we looked
at before in Google

00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:56.370
Analytics about speed
are spot on, right?

00:26:56.370 --> 00:26:59.310
They tell you lots of things
about all of the different

00:26:59.310 --> 00:26:59.920
speed metrics.

00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:02.250
The one thing that they're
missing is they don't have a

00:27:02.250 --> 00:27:04.760
lot of data about the
conversions or the revenue

00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:06.050
that's in Analytics.

00:27:06.050 --> 00:27:08.350
And so when Ilya and I were
talking about doing this

00:27:08.350 --> 00:27:12.440
webcast, we talked about some
reports and some ways that we

00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:16.480
could customize Google Analytics
in order to generate

00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:20.160
that data so you can see
it in one interface.

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:22.500
So what I'm going to do is I'm
going to jump over to Google

00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:27.280
Analytics and walk you guys
through some customization

00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:28.690
that's not too advanced.

00:27:28.690 --> 00:27:30.080
You can totally do this.

00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:31.730
But we want to show you guys
how to make some custom

00:27:31.730 --> 00:27:33.090
reports that have all
this great data.

00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:40.320
That's it.

00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:40.870
Third click.

00:27:40.870 --> 00:27:41.300
Awesome.

00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:41.950
OK.

00:27:41.950 --> 00:27:45.710
So if you've never used Google
Analytics before, we have a

00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:49.060
lot of different ways that you
can customize the product.

00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:50.480
The Advanced Custom Segments--

00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:53.370
that's one way that you can
slice and dice your data.

00:27:53.370 --> 00:27:55.830
And one of my favorites
is the custom reports.

00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:58.200
And the reason why I love custom
reports so much is that

00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:03.430
I can get exactly the data I
want in one screen, and I can

00:28:03.430 --> 00:28:07.140
build in all sorts of metrics
that help me understand

00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:08.980
whatever it is I'm trying
to analyze.

00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:12.550
And so this is an account I have
here, and I have a whole

00:28:12.550 --> 00:28:13.930
bunch of different
custom reports.

00:28:13.930 --> 00:28:16.270
You can see there's many,
many different kinds.

00:28:16.270 --> 00:28:18.780
And you can create your own
custom reports by just

00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:22.200
clicking on this new custom
report button.

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:25.520
And we'll just walk through
a few basics of this.

00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:27.560
I'm going to give my
report a name.

00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:31.770
Maybe it's my awesome
speed report.

00:28:31.770 --> 00:28:35.490
And within my report, I have
two types of information.

00:28:35.490 --> 00:28:38.110
I have metrics and I
have dimensions.

00:28:38.110 --> 00:28:39.610
And metrics are just
numbers, right?

00:28:39.610 --> 00:28:42.570
So when we were looking
at some of the reports

00:28:42.570 --> 00:28:46.520
previously, we were looking at
metrics like DNS response

00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:50.640
time, page load time.

00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:54.140
And so if you could literally
start to type in here page

00:28:54.140 --> 00:28:57.090
load time, and that metric's
going to pop up.

00:28:57.090 --> 00:29:00.250
So I can put that
into my report.

00:29:00.250 --> 00:29:02.290
And so we have all of
those great speed

00:29:02.290 --> 00:29:03.390
metrics we talked about.

00:29:03.390 --> 00:29:05.050
I encourage you to
play with this.

00:29:05.050 --> 00:29:07.280
But we also have all those
business metrics

00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:08.110
that I really like.

00:29:08.110 --> 00:29:10.910
So I could type in something
like revenue, which is

00:29:10.910 --> 00:29:13.070
amazing, right, because
that tells me how

00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:14.770
much money I'm making.

00:29:14.770 --> 00:29:16.830
And I have conversion
rate as well.

00:29:16.830 --> 00:29:22.020
So I'm going to just type in
goal number seven that I have

00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:23.000
configured here.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.510
ILYA GRIGORIK: Maybe just
one quick note.

00:29:24.510 --> 00:29:26.870
So revenue's like the
ultimate metric.

00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:27.125
Ultimate.

00:29:27.125 --> 00:29:27.380
Right?

00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:30.050
JUSTIN CUTRONI: Absolutely.

00:29:30.050 --> 00:29:32.670
ILYA GRIGORIK: But having said
that, for sites that may not

00:29:32.670 --> 00:29:34.150
have a direct conversion
to render.

00:29:34.150 --> 00:29:35.850
For example, my own site
is a blog, right?

00:29:35.850 --> 00:29:38.000
I don't have revenue from it.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.380
But I do have goals defined on
my blog, which are things

00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:42.770
like, have you visited
my archive page?

00:29:42.770 --> 00:29:44.380
Have you subscribed
to my RSS feed?

00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:47.210
So I could also use those
metrics in here, right?

00:29:47.210 --> 00:29:47.770
JUSTIN CUTRONI: Absolutely.

00:29:47.770 --> 00:29:50.770
Just because you don't sell a
product, it doesn't mean you

00:29:50.770 --> 00:29:52.340
don't have goals for
your website.

00:29:52.340 --> 00:29:54.090
It just means those goals
are different.

00:29:54.090 --> 00:29:56.910
So like you said, if
you're a blogger--

00:29:56.910 --> 00:30:00.180
I'm a blogger myself, and the
objective of my blog is to

00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:01.190
connect with people.

00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:04.770
And so my goals might be around
people connecting with

00:30:04.770 --> 00:30:07.990
me via social media through the
blog, or people submitting

00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:09.160
contact forms.

00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:13.990
So that's why the whole process
of aligning the Google

00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:17.260
Analytics data with your
business is really important,

00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:18.680
and we do that through
these goals.

00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:21.090
So if you don't have any goals
set up, you're really missing

00:30:21.090 --> 00:30:22.070
out on the best data.

00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:24.930
You could measure visits, and
pages per visit, and time, and

00:30:24.930 --> 00:30:25.840
all those standard things.

00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:28.960
But you really have to distill
it down to what am I trying to

00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:29.750
do with this blog?

00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:33.490
What is the value that I'm
trying to get out of this?

00:30:33.490 --> 00:30:35.550
So we can add a lot
of different

00:30:35.550 --> 00:30:36.680
metrics here to our report.

00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:41.380
And again, metrics around
revenue and conversions, so no

00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:42.920
matter what the site does.

00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:46.600
And I can then add in a whole
bunch of different dimensions.

00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:48.600
And dimensions are just--

00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:50.650
really, they're attributes
of a visit, right?

00:30:50.650 --> 00:30:53.180
So they could be the page the
visitor's looking at, it could

00:30:53.180 --> 00:30:55.700
be the country the visitor
came from--

00:30:55.700 --> 00:30:57.350
I can put almost anything
in here.

00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:59.310
So let's just put in country.

00:30:59.310 --> 00:31:02.850
And so what will happen is
Google Analytics will build

00:31:02.850 --> 00:31:05.610
out this report, and it'll show
me all of my countries,

00:31:05.610 --> 00:31:07.990
and then the metrics for
those countries.

00:31:07.990 --> 00:31:11.020
So if I click Save--

00:31:11.020 --> 00:31:12.180
ILYA GRIGORIK: And this
is all done live.

00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:13.030
JUSTIN CUTRONI: Yes, exactly.

00:31:13.030 --> 00:31:13.590
Live.

00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:17.130
So here, now we have a list of
countries, and we have the

00:31:17.130 --> 00:31:19.800
metrics that we were
talking about--

00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:23.010
average page load time, revenue,
and conversion rate.

00:31:23.010 --> 00:31:26.750
Now I'm going to skip to a
similar report here that's

00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:29.430
just maybe a little bit more
advanced, because I want to

00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:30.560
show you guys a few things.

00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:33.460
So I've got countries listed
here in one column, and I've

00:31:33.460 --> 00:31:36.890
got a whole bunch of our
different performance metrics,

00:31:36.890 --> 00:31:40.610
like load time, domain look
up time, redirect time.

00:31:40.610 --> 00:31:42.870
And I've got a couple
of conversions here.

00:31:42.870 --> 00:31:44.000
I've got revenue--

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.900
the revenue is all zeroes
because I wanted to put

00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:49.100
revenue in there just to show
you you could, but I don't

00:31:49.100 --> 00:31:51.120
have any revenue configured
on my blog.

00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:54.460
But I have this goal of people
actually reading articles.

00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:56.690
And so what I can start to do is
start to look and see like,

00:31:56.690 --> 00:31:59.950
is there any relationship
between some of the speed

00:31:59.950 --> 00:32:02.890
metrics, like domain lookup time
or redirect time, and the

00:32:02.890 --> 00:32:05.120
conversion rate that's
happening.

00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:07.200
What I think is really
interesting about building

00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:11.350
this report out is something we
mentioned before, where you

00:32:11.350 --> 00:32:13.860
have metrics for different parts
of the process, right?

00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:17.830
So whether it's server, network,
or browser based.

00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:21.920
And certain types of things
are dependent on like

00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:23.940
geolocation, or they might
be dependent on

00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:25.240
the piece of content.

00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:28.320
So this report has country
and territory.

00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:30.550
And so for those things, I would
be thinking like, oh,

00:32:30.550 --> 00:32:33.950
network and server types of
configuration and metrics,

00:32:33.950 --> 00:32:36.340
because they're distant,
right?

00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:38.610
You said you've only got one
server here in California.

00:32:38.610 --> 00:32:42.170
So is there a problem with the
Philippines, or Indonesia, or

00:32:42.170 --> 00:32:43.290
someplace that's far away?

00:32:43.290 --> 00:32:45.210
ILYA GRIGORIK: So a very
concrete conclusion would have

00:32:45.210 --> 00:32:48.780
been, if I was, let's say,
selling something, and I could

00:32:48.780 --> 00:32:52.590
show that in Asia, I'm getting
lower conversions and it

00:32:52.590 --> 00:32:55.570
corresponds to higher response
times, maybe I get another

00:32:55.570 --> 00:32:59.190
server in Asia, or I use a CDN
provider or something similar.

00:32:59.190 --> 00:32:59.890
JUSTIN CUTRONI: Absolutely.

00:32:59.890 --> 00:33:01.270
And so that's the
thing I think is

00:33:01.270 --> 00:33:02.370
great about this report.

00:33:02.370 --> 00:33:04.500
Now, if you're like me--

00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:05.480
I'm the analytics guy.

00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:06.740
I have to look at
a lot of data.

00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:11.110
Sometimes I can get lazy, and I
want new and different ways

00:33:11.110 --> 00:33:11.990
to look at these things.

00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:13.610
And so I want to show
you a really great

00:33:13.610 --> 00:33:15.580
tip in Google Analytics.

00:33:15.580 --> 00:33:18.080
You'll notice here we have a
series of buttons on the top

00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:21.900
right part of our table, and I
can change the view of my data

00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:24.310
into something called the
performance view.

00:33:24.310 --> 00:33:28.570
And this allows me to literally,
like visually, in

00:33:28.570 --> 00:33:31.100
green and red, see what's
good or bad.

00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:32.950
So I can say, all right, I want
to look at the average

00:33:32.950 --> 00:33:35.940
domain lookup here, and I can
see that time for these

00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:37.050
different countries.

00:33:37.050 --> 00:33:40.830
And I'm going to switch this
over to my conversion rate.

00:33:40.830 --> 00:33:44.100
Now, this is kind of hard.

00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:46.970
Red means something's really
bad, and green mean

00:33:46.970 --> 00:33:47.730
something's OK.

00:33:47.730 --> 00:33:51.380
So now my analysis is basically,
good, bad, bad,

00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:54.740
good, bad, good, bad,
good, bad, bad.

00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:55.120
Done.

00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:58.640
Now, I can go to my speed expert
Ilya here, and he can

00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:02.090
optimize the domain lookup
time for all of those

00:34:02.090 --> 00:34:02.820
different countries.

00:34:02.820 --> 00:34:05.650
And the first thing he can do is
be like, dude, I don't care

00:34:05.650 --> 00:34:06.630
about Malaysia.

00:34:06.630 --> 00:34:08.360
We're not doing business
in Malaysia.

00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:09.409
It's not really a big deal.

00:34:09.409 --> 00:34:11.179
But I really do care
about France.

00:34:11.179 --> 00:34:11.980
ILYA GRIGORIK: Although we
do care about Malaysia.

00:34:11.980 --> 00:34:13.060
JUSTIN CUTRONI: We do
care about Malaysia,

00:34:13.060 --> 00:34:14.230
we do, in real life.

00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:16.139
But you could look at other--

00:34:16.139 --> 00:34:17.699
like Canada, why are
you so slow?

00:34:17.699 --> 00:34:19.340
Or Morocco?

00:34:19.340 --> 00:34:22.600
You can look at these other
geographic locations, and this

00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:25.620
is showing you that the
conversion rate-- because it's

00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:27.389
like, literally,
it's red here--

00:34:27.389 --> 00:34:28.980
for those types of
places is lower.

00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:32.190
So I've got over 100
rows of data.

00:34:32.190 --> 00:34:34.409
I can expand this
out and look.

00:34:34.409 --> 00:34:36.560
But I really like this
visualization.

00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:40.820
And I can change this metric in
the first column to be any

00:34:40.820 --> 00:34:41.980
of the metrics that
I configured

00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:42.989
in this custom report.

00:34:42.989 --> 00:34:46.469
And again, this can be any of
these speed-related metrics.

00:34:46.469 --> 00:34:50.820
And now I have a nice visual way
of seeing the relationship

00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:54.659
between a speed metric and an
end business result, which, I

00:34:54.659 --> 00:34:55.370
mean, to me--

00:34:55.370 --> 00:34:56.560
ILYA GRIGORIK: This is an
awesome bridge, right?

00:34:56.560 --> 00:34:58.950
Because for somebody who's
responsible for the bottom

00:34:58.950 --> 00:35:00.850
line of the business, you can
actually now connect it to

00:35:00.850 --> 00:35:02.670
speed, and be like,
this is why I need

00:35:02.670 --> 00:35:03.590
to optimize my site.

00:35:03.590 --> 00:35:04.280
JUSTIN CUTRONI: Totally.

00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:06.230
ILYA GRIGORIK: And vice versa,
if I'm a developer, I can look

00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:09.670
at this data and show my bottom
line guy that hey, we

00:35:09.670 --> 00:35:12.130
really need to invest into
web optimization.

00:35:12.130 --> 00:35:13.000
JUSTIN CUTRONI: Absolutely.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.620
And one thing I'll just
show you guys.

00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:16.410
This report--

00:35:16.410 --> 00:35:19.070
I have actually created
this report, and

00:35:19.070 --> 00:35:20.950
this tab has geodata.

00:35:20.950 --> 00:35:21.970
But I've got other tabs.

00:35:21.970 --> 00:35:25.360
I've got other tabs that show
this data segmented by the

00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:26.440
different browsers.

00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:30.110
And so on this tab, instead
of having things like

00:35:30.110 --> 00:35:33.010
server-related metrics, or
network related metrics, I can

00:35:33.010 --> 00:35:34.900
have browser-related metrics.

00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:37.650
And now I can look at each
browser and do the same type

00:35:37.650 --> 00:35:38.710
of analysis.

00:35:38.710 --> 00:35:42.750
And I can actually add a layer
of detail where for each

00:35:42.750 --> 00:35:48.810
browser, if I click on it, I can
break that browser down by

00:35:48.810 --> 00:35:51.230
the pages that were displayed
via that browser.

00:35:51.230 --> 00:35:53.860
And so now I'm doing that
drilling down, that

00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:57.930
segmentation, that helps me
understand like, this page in

00:35:57.930 --> 00:36:00.800
this browser might be
really, really bad.

00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:03.580
And I can switch over, and
again, do my conversion or my

00:36:03.580 --> 00:36:05.950
revenue-type comparison using
that visualization.

00:36:05.950 --> 00:36:10.210
So this is a really
handy report.

00:36:10.210 --> 00:36:13.170
We've got a little treat for you
about it at the end of the

00:36:13.170 --> 00:36:13.770
presentation.

00:36:13.770 --> 00:36:15.890
But play with the
custom reports.

00:36:15.890 --> 00:36:20.360
Go build some custom reports
around your speed metrics and

00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:23.530
various dimensions that they're
appropriate for, and

00:36:23.530 --> 00:36:25.690
you'll be amazed at
what you find.

00:36:25.690 --> 00:36:26.510
ILYA GRIGORIK: Awesome.

00:36:26.510 --> 00:36:27.520
JUSTIN CUTRONI: So let's
go back to the

00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:28.730
presentation, maybe.

00:36:28.730 --> 00:36:29.050
ILYA GRIGORIK: Yeah.

00:36:29.050 --> 00:36:32.880
So we have just a few
more quick tips.

00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:34.730
So I think we talked
about all of this.

00:36:34.730 --> 00:36:36.490
JUSTIN CUTRONI: Yeah, these
were just backup slides.

00:36:36.490 --> 00:36:38.470
ILYA GRIGORIK: Always good
to have a backup.

00:36:38.470 --> 00:36:39.480
Right?

00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:43.070
So yes, this is an awesome,
awesome report.

00:36:43.070 --> 00:36:45.040
You can also build your
own dashboard.

00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:47.860
So unlike a custom report, this
is just kind of a quick

00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:49.870
way to assemble a bunch
of metrics.

00:36:49.870 --> 00:36:52.010
And so a couple of
very quick tips.

00:36:52.010 --> 00:36:55.550
So, by default, Google Analytics
does not sample the

00:36:55.550 --> 00:36:58.020
navigation timing data
from 100% of users.

00:36:58.020 --> 00:37:00.190
It's set to 1%.

00:37:00.190 --> 00:37:03.150
Now, there is a limit to how
much data you can collect,

00:37:03.150 --> 00:37:05.500
which is 10,000 samples a day.

00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:07.220
So my tip is-- and this
is something that

00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:08.530
I've done on my site--

00:37:08.530 --> 00:37:11.650
is in your Google Analytics
configuration code, if your

00:37:11.650 --> 00:37:14.510
site is below 10,000 visits, you
can actually increase your

00:37:14.510 --> 00:37:15.330
sampling rate.

00:37:15.330 --> 00:37:16.470
So actually, you
have more data.

00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:19.320
So that's one thing you should
probably do if you don't have

00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:21.060
a lot of traffic like my site.

00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:26.800
So you can set your site speed
sample rate to 100%.

00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:29.000
Second thing that I've
done for my site--

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:32.070
you can take any of these
reports, you can create a PDF

00:37:32.070 --> 00:37:34.220
report that just gets emailed
to you every week.

00:37:34.220 --> 00:37:37.320
So every Monday, you get an
email which I just look at

00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:39.720
which shows me if anything
bad has happened.

00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:41.880
JUSTIN CUTRONI: And what's
really cool is that you can

00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:45.280
create an automated email
report, send a PDF format of

00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:47.230
the custom report that we just
looked at that has the

00:37:47.230 --> 00:37:48.670
business data in there.

00:37:48.670 --> 00:37:50.670
And that's something that maybe
I'm not going to look at

00:37:50.670 --> 00:37:54.100
every day, but I might look
at that weekly or monthly

00:37:54.100 --> 00:37:55.310
depending on how
big my site is.

00:37:55.310 --> 00:37:55.770
ILYA GRIGORIK: Exactly.

00:37:55.770 --> 00:37:58.850
It's just a very easy way to
keep tabs on this thing.

00:37:58.850 --> 00:38:01.140
And then the last tip is if
you're doing performance

00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:04.550
optimization, one thing that
I find very, very useful is

00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:06.090
adding annotations on a graph.

00:38:06.090 --> 00:38:10.030
So it's a little bit hard to
see here, but if you expand

00:38:10.030 --> 00:38:12.720
the annotation bar, you can
actually add your own notes in

00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:15.120
there such that when you see
that peak or valley in the

00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:17.690
graph, you can then go back and
be like, oh, yeah, that's

00:38:17.690 --> 00:38:20.770
when I did that crazy thing,
and now everything's fast.

00:38:20.770 --> 00:38:20.970
JUSTIN CUTRONI: Yeah.

00:38:20.970 --> 00:38:24.010
Annotations are a really,
really important thing.

00:38:24.010 --> 00:38:26.430
The great thing about
annotations are they're shared

00:38:26.430 --> 00:38:29.100
across your Google Analytics
account, so if a

00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:31.730
businessperson like me logs in,
I can see an annotation

00:38:31.730 --> 00:38:34.030
that Ilya left that said,
hey, we added a

00:38:34.030 --> 00:38:35.920
new server in Malaysia.

00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:38.140
And that might be great, because
that might have been

00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:40.470
the date that my conversion rate
started to increase, or--

00:38:40.470 --> 00:38:42.590
ILYA GRIGORIK: By the way,
I make your site fast.

00:38:42.590 --> 00:38:46.340
JUSTIN CUTRONI: Yeah, he just
types in optimize site.

00:38:46.340 --> 00:38:50.420
So we showed you guys some
customizations, and we're just

00:38:50.420 --> 00:38:51.890
going to give those to you.

00:38:51.890 --> 00:38:55.470
So these links that are here
on the screen will, if you

00:38:55.470 --> 00:38:58.060
type them into your browser,
they will automatically open

00:38:58.060 --> 00:39:00.390
up Google Analytics and they'll
ask you if you'd like

00:39:00.390 --> 00:39:03.660
to add them into your Google
Analytics account.

00:39:03.660 --> 00:39:07.500
So there's the business impact
of speed-- that's the custom

00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:09.040
report that I was showing
you guys.

00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:12.530
So it's got a number of metrics
along with your

00:39:12.530 --> 00:39:14.140
conversio-type metrics.

00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:16.000
There is a little bit
of customization

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:16.980
you'll need to do.

00:39:16.980 --> 00:39:19.980
Make sure you have goals set
up in Google Analytics, and

00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:22.160
make sure that you choose
your goals for

00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:23.390
that particular report.

00:39:23.390 --> 00:39:25.590
But other than that, that's
all you need to do.

00:39:25.590 --> 00:39:29.230
We created a site performance
dashboard that has a lot of

00:39:29.230 --> 00:39:31.680
just the general metrics
around how your site's

00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:32.300
performing.

00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:34.370
That's a great one if you're
into speed, if you're into

00:39:34.370 --> 00:39:37.370
site performance to use every
day, and you can automate the

00:39:37.370 --> 00:39:40.530
delivery of that via email so
you get it every morning.

00:39:40.530 --> 00:39:42.670
Don't even need to log in
to GA, which is great.

00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:44.640
ILYA GRIGORIK: So, Justin, I
think just because we're so

00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:47.050
excited, we kind of went
over time here.

00:39:47.050 --> 00:39:49.430
So there are some questions.

00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:50.950
I'm not sure if we're
going to have much

00:39:50.950 --> 00:39:54.798
time to get into the--

00:39:54.798 --> 00:39:55.530
let me see.

00:39:55.530 --> 00:39:57.300
Where are we?

00:39:57.300 --> 00:39:58.550
Here we go.

00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:04.180
If we can't answer the question
right now, then we'll

00:40:04.180 --> 00:40:07.300
follow up on Google+, so feel
free to ping us there.

00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:09.500
But I think there's a few that
we can answer quickly.

00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:14.320
So this question I think I can
take, which is, Google APIs

00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:18.910
are really, really powerful,
but JavaScript makes

00:40:18.910 --> 00:40:20.160
potentially my site slower.

00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:21.180
Should I be using it?

00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:24.370
And the answer there is, you
should absolutely use the

00:40:24.370 --> 00:40:30.810
HTML5 five features in a
browser, because unlike trying

00:40:30.810 --> 00:40:32.540
to fill in different
capabilities within

00:40:32.540 --> 00:40:34.480
JavaScript, when you have
capabilities right in a

00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:35.960
browser, they will go faster.

00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:38.020
You shouldn't be scared of using
JavaScript, especially

00:40:38.020 --> 00:40:40.410
if that's what makes
your site tick.

00:40:40.410 --> 00:40:41.860
So measure these things.

00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:44.070
That's probably the most
important message, or the

00:40:44.070 --> 00:40:44.875
answer there.

00:40:44.875 --> 00:40:45.660
JUSTIN CUTRONI: Yeah,
and maybe we'll

00:40:45.660 --> 00:40:46.520
just take one more.

00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:48.350
This one looks like it's
right up my alley.

00:40:48.350 --> 00:40:51.490
When using the site speed report
in Google Analytics,

00:40:51.490 --> 00:40:54.550
how can we analyze the potential
amount of sales lost

00:40:54.550 --> 00:40:57.300
due to the site being
x seconds slow?

00:40:57.300 --> 00:41:00.350
Well, we really can't show you
the potential amount of sales.

00:41:00.350 --> 00:41:02.600
We can't model what
might happen.

00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:05.970
But using that custom report
that has the revenue from your

00:41:05.970 --> 00:41:08.830
website in it along with some
of the other performance

00:41:08.830 --> 00:41:11.830
metrics, you'll be able to see
if there's a relationship

00:41:11.830 --> 00:41:14.540
between something that has
poor performance and the

00:41:14.540 --> 00:41:15.870
amount of revenue that
it generates.

00:41:15.870 --> 00:41:19.570
So while it can't show you the
loss, you can use that as a

00:41:19.570 --> 00:41:21.480
baseline for optimization.

00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:22.790
ILYA GRIGORIK: I'll just
make a quick note.

00:41:22.790 --> 00:41:26.140
Google actually did some tests
on our search pages where we

00:41:26.140 --> 00:41:29.800
actually made this search
slower, right?

00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:32.310
And we tracked the
impact of that.

00:41:32.310 --> 00:41:34.280
So you could actually
do the same thing.

00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:35.740
This is kind of a weird
request to go to your

00:41:35.740 --> 00:41:36.540
developer and say, hey--

00:41:36.540 --> 00:41:37.430
JUSTIN CUTRONI: Slow
the site down.

00:41:37.430 --> 00:41:40.160
ILYA GRIGORIK: Let's run an AB
test and make part of the

00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:41.380
experience slower.

00:41:41.380 --> 00:41:45.460
So you could quantify this
if you wanted to.

00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:47.690
JUSTIN CUTRONI: I think that's
actually all we have time for.

00:41:47.690 --> 00:41:50.570
Like we said, ping either
of us through Google+.

00:41:50.570 --> 00:41:53.280
The Google Analytics, we
have a page as well.

00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:56.580
And we'll try to bang out
some of these after this

00:41:56.580 --> 00:41:56.960
[INAUDIBLE].

00:41:56.960 --> 00:41:57.680
ILYA GRIGORIK: Yep,
and we'll post the

00:41:57.680 --> 00:41:59.030
responses on the Moderator.

00:41:59.030 --> 00:41:59.520
JUSTIN CUTRONI: Absolutely.

00:41:59.520 --> 00:41:59.810
ILYA GRIGORIK: Yep.

00:41:59.810 --> 00:42:00.130
JUSTIN CUTRONI: Great.

00:42:00.130 --> 00:42:00.440
ILYA GRIGORIK: Great.

00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:00.980
Thank you, guys.

00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:02.230
JUSTIN CUTRONI: Thanks,
everybody.
