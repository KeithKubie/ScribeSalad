00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:08.990
So what I shared with you today are
some studies that we have done on

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:16.170
understanding T-cells memory, in
particular cytotoxic CD8 T-cells memory.

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.170
T- cells are composed of two major subsets,
the CD4 T-cells which provide help for

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:27.720
antibody responses predominantly and
then you have CD8 T-cells. These are T-cells

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.239
that recognize infected cells and
can kill these infected cells.

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:39.300
A CD8 T-cell is the best mechanism that
we have, are the best soldiers that we

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.469
have, to eliminate either virally
infected cells or tumor cells, so this is

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.719
a very important way of eliminating your
infected cells. The CD8 T-cells can

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.610
actually -- they will attach to the
infected cell or to the tumor cell. They

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.530
do this because the T-cell receptor will
recognize peptides -- they can either be

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.059
tumor antigen peptides or they can be
peptides coming from the virus, for example

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.430
if the cell is infected with HIV,
there will be peptides from the HIV

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.840
virus which are expressed
presented by MHC class 1 molecules on

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.630
the cell surface. So here you've got a
piece of the bar a peptide sticking on

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.640
the surface of the infected cell, you've
got a T-cell which recognizes that

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.850
particular peptide presented by the MHC
class 1 molecule. That interaction will

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.880
result in that T-cell then killing that
infected cell. And so the CD8 T-cells are

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.640
referred to as cytotoxic CD8 T-cells or
CD8 t-cells. So when

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.049
I talk now in for the next 15 minutes or
so I will use these terms

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.680
interchangeably. I might say CTL and I
might say CD8 T-cell but it's the same thing,

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.380
a cell that can kill that
eliminate a virally infected cell.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:02.729
So we used this mouse model of acute infection
to study the properties of memory CD8 T-cells

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.570
and what we found was that memory
CD8 T-cells basically can live for the

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.670
life of the mouse after vaccination or
after the infection is cleared, and we

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.780
have then extended these studies in
humans and shown that people who got the

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:22.140
smallpox vaccine even 78 years ago
have memory CD8 T-cells that recognize

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:28.080
that the smallpox virus. So long-term T-cell
memories maintained not only in

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.490
mice but also in humans and can last for
literally 50 years or longer.

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:36.690
So then the question was. how are these
T-cells maintained? And work that we did

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.630
along with other people showed that the
T-cells are maintained two ways.

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.540
One, they are actually intrinsically
very long-lived.

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.820
They can live for many, many years and
most of the time they're just very quiescent,

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.239
they're not dividing they're just sitting
as quiescent cells. Likewise I mean

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:58.470
they're not replicating or dividing the
sitting as a cell that's in a g0 g1 phase.

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:05.810
But they also undergo what we and
others have termed a homeostatic

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.050
proliferation. That is, they have a stem
cell like property where they can

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:15.840
self-renew. So every few months in a
mouse and every few years in a human,

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.459
there's a capacity of these 
cells to self-renew.

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:24.900
They will undergo another division to
maintain the numbers, so if there's a slow

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.070
attrition or death of these cells
there's also a slow birth of these cells

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:34.410
that maintains numbers at fairly
constant levels for many, many years.

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.370
So this is one intrinsic property of a
memory T-cell -- it can self-renew itself

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.910
and that's how it's maintained for such
a long period. The other very interesting

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:48.690
property of memory T-cells is that when
they now see the infecting pathogen,

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:55.079
which they can recognize,
they make a very rapid

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:59.299
effector response, and we're dealing here
with cytotoxic CD8 T-cells ,so even

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:05.549
though this memory cell looks
like a very quiescent cell sitting without

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:11.459
any replication, as soon as it sees the
invading pathogen which it

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:15.510
can recognize, it very rapidly elaborates
effector function. And what I mean by

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:21.000
effector function is that it can now
very rapidly kill that cell. So a memory

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.680
cell has two properties which are very
different from that of a naive cell --

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.440
that is, one that has not gotten this program
of being a memory cell. One, it's much

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.340
longer-lived intrinsically, it has the
capability of this homeostatic

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:39.650
proliferation to maintain its numbers,
and it has the

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:44.600
ability to elaborate effector function
very rapidly. And that's t

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:49.160
the cellular basis of memory by CD8
T-cells.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:54.590
My lab has been interested in
this question for almost 30 years now -- I

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:59.210
was at UCLA when we first started these
studies and then I moved to Emory

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:02.750
University in 1995 and for the last 20
years we have been continuing these

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:06.320
fundamental studies on T-cell memory
both in animal models and in humans and

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:16.649
obviously these have a lot of
implications in terms of optimizing and developing different vaccines.
