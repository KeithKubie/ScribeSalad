00:00:00.762 --> 00:00:01.720
- [Voiceover] We're going to talk about

00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:03.984
a really powerful way to analyze circuits

00:00:03.984 --> 00:00:07.262
called the Node Voltage Method.

00:00:07.262 --> 00:00:09.707
Before we start talking
about what this method is,

00:00:09.707 --> 00:00:13.874
we're going to talk about a
new term called a node voltage.

00:00:15.353 --> 00:00:18.270
So far, we already have the idea of

00:00:20.053 --> 00:00:24.220
an element has a voltage
across it, and we refer to that

00:00:25.337 --> 00:00:28.870
as an element voltage, or
if it's part of a circuit

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:30.255
and it's a branch of a circuit,

00:00:30.255 --> 00:00:32.922
it'd be called a branch voltage.

00:00:40.636 --> 00:00:41.994
That's a voltage that's associated

00:00:41.994 --> 00:00:44.486
with a particular element.

00:00:44.486 --> 00:00:48.653
So now we have the idea of
something called a node voltage.

00:00:53.634 --> 00:00:55.907
This is still a voltage,
it's not anything strange,

00:00:55.907 --> 00:00:57.871
but if we go over to our circuit here,

00:00:57.871 --> 00:00:58.840
and we label the nodes.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.664
Let's start labeling the nodes,
we'll call this node here

00:01:01.664 --> 00:01:05.003
where this junction between
this resistor and this source,

00:01:05.003 --> 00:01:06.396
we'll call this node one.

00:01:06.396 --> 00:01:10.041
This is the junction between
these two components here.

00:01:10.041 --> 00:01:13.728
There's another node that's
these two resistors connected

00:01:13.728 --> 00:01:16.413
to this current source,
and that's a single

00:01:16.413 --> 00:01:20.600
distributed node, so
we'll call that node two.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.771
And down here, these three
components are connected together

00:01:23.771 --> 00:01:26.854
in a junction, and that's node three.

00:01:27.717 --> 00:01:31.104
To define a node voltage,
the first idea we need

00:01:31.104 --> 00:01:35.271
is to define a reference node,
the idea of a reference node.

00:01:44.304 --> 00:01:46.699
A good choice for the
reference node is usually one

00:01:46.699 --> 00:01:50.980
that's connected to the
terminals of the power sources,

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:55.723
or it's the node that's
connected to a lot of branches,

00:01:55.723 --> 00:01:57.913
a lot of elements, and node three here

00:01:57.913 --> 00:02:00.181
is a good choice for a reference node.

00:02:00.181 --> 00:02:04.662
The way we mark that is with
a symbol that looks like this,

00:02:04.662 --> 00:02:09.104
a ground symbol, that's
called ground in this circuit.

00:02:09.104 --> 00:02:13.082
There's other kinds of ways
to indicate a reference node.

00:02:13.082 --> 00:02:14.641
That's a common way.

00:02:14.641 --> 00:02:18.503
You can draw one that
looks like the ground,

00:02:18.503 --> 00:02:20.171
connected to the ground.

00:02:20.171 --> 00:02:23.758
Sometimes you'll see it
with just an upside-down T,

00:02:23.758 --> 00:02:27.675
like that, that's another
way to draw a ground.

00:02:28.586 --> 00:02:32.014
This symbol on a schematic
indicates the reference node.

00:02:32.014 --> 00:02:36.445
We've picked a reference node
to be node three, down here.

00:02:36.445 --> 00:02:40.195
So, a node voltage is
measured between a node

00:02:41.812 --> 00:02:43.747
and the reference node.

00:02:43.747 --> 00:02:46.914
In our case we have this voltage here,

00:02:48.362 --> 00:02:52.529
is the node voltage on
node one, we'll call it V1.

00:02:56.605 --> 00:03:00.188
This voltage here is
going to be called V2.

00:03:02.179 --> 00:03:04.062
And in particular, these
voltages are measured

00:03:04.062 --> 00:03:08.229
with respect to node three,
so there's the minus and plus

00:03:09.372 --> 00:03:10.955
and minus and plus.

00:03:11.861 --> 00:03:13.767
We're going to use these node voltages

00:03:13.767 --> 00:03:16.017
in the Node Voltage Method.

00:03:17.063 --> 00:03:18.080
First, what I want to do,

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.714
I want to label my complements here.

00:03:21.714 --> 00:03:25.881
We're going to call this
Vs, and make it 15 volts.

00:03:26.983 --> 00:03:30.083
This resistor's going to
be R1, and we'll give it

00:03:30.083 --> 00:03:31.583
a value of 4kohms.

00:03:35.094 --> 00:03:39.261
We'll call this R2, and we'll
give it a value of 2kohms.

00:03:42.853 --> 00:03:45.827
This is the same circuit
that we analyzed when we did

00:03:45.827 --> 00:03:50.428
application of the fundamental
laws in another video.

00:03:50.428 --> 00:03:54.511
Oh, and the last guy here,
Is, current source Is,

00:03:55.406 --> 00:03:58.406
and we'll make that one 3 milliamps.

00:04:01.623 --> 00:04:03.058
We've analyzed this circuit before.

00:04:03.058 --> 00:04:07.907
We used Kirchoff's Laws,
KVL and KCL, to figure out

00:04:07.907 --> 00:04:10.589
what the voltages and
currents were in this circuit.

00:04:10.589 --> 00:04:11.940
We're going to do the same analysis,

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.890
but this time we're
going to use what we call

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:16.073
the Node Voltage Method.

00:04:16.073 --> 00:04:18.190
It's basically the same application

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.732
of the fundamental laws, we
use Ohm's Law, Kirchoff's Laws,

00:04:21.732 --> 00:04:24.366
but it's in a really
clever, organized way,

00:04:24.366 --> 00:04:26.773
that is really efficient.

00:04:26.773 --> 00:04:29.104
Whoever thought this up was pretty bright

00:04:29.104 --> 00:04:31.815
and I'm really glad
that they wrote it down

00:04:31.815 --> 00:04:33.615
and shared it with us.

00:04:33.615 --> 00:04:35.781
What I want to do first is just write down

00:04:35.781 --> 00:04:38.306
what are the steps of this method?

00:04:38.306 --> 00:04:40.458
It's not a theory, it's
a method, so it basically

00:04:40.458 --> 00:04:42.453
a sequence of steps that you go through

00:04:42.453 --> 00:04:43.890
to analyze the circuit.

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:45.823
I'll write the list right here.

00:04:45.823 --> 00:04:48.823
First step is pick a reference node.

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:53.326
We already did that.

00:04:58.469 --> 00:05:02.219
The second step is to
name the node voltages.

00:05:10.415 --> 00:05:13.742
We already did that,
we named our nodes V1,

00:05:13.742 --> 00:05:16.363
that node there is V1 and
that node there is V2,

00:05:16.363 --> 00:05:19.207
with respect to the reference node,

00:05:19.207 --> 00:05:21.424
which is down there at node three.

00:05:21.424 --> 00:05:23.290
Whenever you talk about node voltages,

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:25.014
there's always an assumption
that one of the nodes

00:05:25.014 --> 00:05:26.681
is a reference node.

00:05:32.031 --> 00:05:35.531
The third step is to solve the easy nodes.

00:05:42.516 --> 00:05:44.805
I'll show you what that means in a second.

00:05:44.805 --> 00:05:47.472
The fourth step is to write KCL,

00:05:51.804 --> 00:05:54.554
Kirchoff's Current Law equations.

00:06:02.237 --> 00:06:05.654
The fifth step is to solve the equations.

00:06:09.723 --> 00:06:13.053
That's the Node Voltage Method,

00:06:13.053 --> 00:06:14.307
and we're going to go
through the rest of this,

00:06:14.307 --> 00:06:16.890
we've done the first two steps.

00:06:18.403 --> 00:06:20.928
What does it mean to solve the easy nodes?

00:06:20.928 --> 00:06:22.962
The easy nodes are the
ones that are connected

00:06:22.962 --> 00:06:25.992
directly to a source that
goes to the reference node.

00:06:25.992 --> 00:06:27.778
That's an example of an easy node.

00:06:27.778 --> 00:06:29.910
So V1 is an easy node.

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:32.509
So let's solve for V1.

00:06:32.509 --> 00:06:35.842
By inspection, I can say V1 is 15 volts.

00:06:40.052 --> 00:06:41.650
That's Step Three.

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:43.023
The other node's not easy,

00:06:43.023 --> 00:06:44.786
the other node has lots of components

00:06:44.786 --> 00:06:47.853
and something interesting's
going on over here.

00:06:47.853 --> 00:06:50.075
So this was step three.

00:06:50.075 --> 00:06:51.461
Let's label the steps.

00:06:51.461 --> 00:06:53.128
Here's the Step One.

00:06:54.175 --> 00:06:55.508
Here's Step Two.

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:59.393
And here's Step Three.

00:07:03.534 --> 00:07:06.043
Now we're ready to go to Step Four,

00:07:06.043 --> 00:07:08.376
let me move up a little bit.

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:17.001
Step Four is write the
Kirchoff's Current Law equations

00:07:17.001 --> 00:07:18.427
directly from the circuit.

00:07:18.427 --> 00:07:22.018
We're going to do this in a special way,

00:07:22.018 --> 00:07:25.011
We're going to perform at
this node here, at node two.

00:07:25.011 --> 00:07:28.855
We're going to write the
current law for this.

00:07:28.855 --> 00:07:31.654
That means we got to
identify the currents.

00:07:31.654 --> 00:07:34.913
There's a current, we'll
call that a current,

00:07:34.913 --> 00:07:37.337
and that's a current.

00:07:37.337 --> 00:07:40.374
Let me give some names to these
currents just to be clear.

00:07:40.374 --> 00:07:44.071
We'll call this one I1
because it goes through R1.

00:07:44.071 --> 00:07:48.238
We'll call this one here, I2
because it goes through R2.

00:07:50.887 --> 00:07:52.804
This one is already Is.

00:07:55.871 --> 00:07:59.051
Now let's write Kirchoff's
Current Law just in terms of I,

00:07:59.051 --> 00:08:02.178
and we'll say all the
currents flowing into the node

00:08:02.178 --> 00:08:06.002
add up to zero, so these
two have arrows going out,

00:08:06.002 --> 00:08:08.641
so they're going to get negative signs

00:08:08.641 --> 00:08:10.631
when we write Kirchoff's Current Law.

00:08:10.631 --> 00:08:12.714
Let's do that right here.

00:08:16.458 --> 00:08:17.708
And we write I1

00:08:20.216 --> 00:08:21.049
minus I2

00:08:23.015 --> 00:08:23.848
minus Is

00:08:25.865 --> 00:08:27.115
equals to zero.

00:08:31.283 --> 00:08:34.616
So right now we're working on Step Four.

00:08:38.423 --> 00:08:41.537
This is the essence of
the Node Voltage Method.

00:08:41.537 --> 00:08:42.638
This is where we do something new

00:08:42.638 --> 00:08:44.138
that we haven't done before.

00:08:44.138 --> 00:08:45.473
We're going to write these currents

00:08:45.473 --> 00:08:48.607
in terms of the node voltages.

00:08:48.607 --> 00:08:52.761
So we can write I1, I1 is
current flowing this way

00:08:52.761 --> 00:08:53.977
through this current.

00:08:53.977 --> 00:08:54.977
I1 equals V1

00:08:58.418 --> 00:08:59.251
minus V2

00:09:00.879 --> 00:09:01.712
over R1.

00:09:06.009 --> 00:09:08.824
That's the current flowing in resistor R1,

00:09:08.824 --> 00:09:10.991
in terms of node voltages.

00:09:13.385 --> 00:09:16.525
The current flowing down through I2,

00:09:16.525 --> 00:09:20.660
now we have to subtract I2,
so we just apply Ohm's Law

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:23.768
directly, which means
that the current in I2

00:09:23.768 --> 00:09:26.185
is equal to V2 divided by R2.

00:09:30.701 --> 00:09:33.451
The last current is Is, minus Is.

00:09:35.849 --> 00:09:38.767
We'll write that in
terms of Is, like that,

00:09:38.767 --> 00:09:40.517
and that equals zero.

00:09:41.891 --> 00:09:44.709
This means we have now
completed Step Four.

00:09:44.709 --> 00:09:48.876
That is KCL written using the
terminology of node voltages.

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:55.150
We could check off that
we've done Step Four.
