00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.574
Congratulations, you've made your
first step towards a path in back-end

00:00:03.574 --> 00:00:04.220
programming.

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.753
It's essential for back-end programmers
to understand databases in order to

00:00:08.753 --> 00:00:11.335
design, debug and maintain applications.

00:00:11.335 --> 00:00:16.074
In this next course, you'll learn about
the basics of SQL, database design,

00:00:16.074 --> 00:00:17.135
and Python API for

00:00:17.135 --> 00:00:21.254
connecting Python code to a database
by creating a game tournament.

00:00:21.254 --> 00:00:23.042
As you dive into back-end programming,

00:00:23.042 --> 00:00:25.300
there may be times where
you reach your strain zone.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.270
I encourage you to use
the Udacity forums for support.

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:32.479
By the end of this course, you should
have a better idea of whether back-end

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:33.830
programming is the right fit for you.
