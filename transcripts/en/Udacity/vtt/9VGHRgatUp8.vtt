00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.380
The way I've always thought of it,

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:06.550
in those early days,
is that you have the 100% of your time.

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:09.960
Which is building the product and
getting the product out there and

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.630
making sure people know the product.

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:14.750
And then the other 100% of your time,
which is running the business.

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:16.040
And that in those early days,

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:20.980
when you've started hiring, a big part
of that second 100% is just hiring.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.580
Finding people, talking to people,

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.990
getting them excited about
the impact that they can have.

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:32.600
And I wish there was a better
answer than the balances.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:33.700
You just have to work a lot.
