00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:02.360
DOESN'T IT SEEM LIKE THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT
OF EARTHQUAKES LATELY?

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:07.310
THAT'S CAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN, SO DOES THIS
MEAN THIS BIG ONE'S COMING?

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:11.850
AND WHAT CAN YOU DO ABOUT IT?

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.270
HEY GUYS THIS IS ANNIE FOR DNEWS.

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:18.160
A MAJOR EARTHQUAKE STRUCK OFF THE COAST OF
CHILE THIS WEEK, TRIGGERING 7 FT TSUNAMIS

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.240
AND MASS EVACUATIONS ALONG THE COUNTRY'S COASTAL
AREAS.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.990
THE 8.2 QUAKE NEAR CHILE COMES ON THE HEELS
OF SEVERAL SMALLER QUAKES IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:31.600
RECENTLY...BROUGHT TO LIFE BY THIS ONE AMAZING
VIRAL VIDEO OF TWO NEWS ANCHORS FROM KTLA

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.780
BASICALLY NAILING EARTHQUAKE SAFETY PROTOCOL...

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:46.260
FORTUNATELY, NO MAJOR DAMAGE IN EITHER CALIFORNIA
OR CHILE IS REPORTED AT THIS POINT...BUT IT'S

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.539
RAISED ALARM AMONG SOME FOLKS THAT A "BIG
ONE" IS COMING....A "BIG ONE" LIKE THE LA

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:55.660
NORTHRIDGE QUAKE IN 1994, WHICH KILLED DOZENS
AND CAUSED 42 BILLION DOLLARS IN DAMAGE...OR

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.719
LOMA PRIETA IN SAN FRANCISCO IN 1989, WHICH
KILLED 63 AND BADLY EFFED UP INFRASTRUCTURE

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:01.820
IN THE BAY AREA.

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.070
OF COURSE, THERE HAVE BEEN FAR WORSE QUAKES
IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD - LIKE THE 2010

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:07.560
QUAKE THAT DEVASTATED HAITI.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.430
CAN WE PREDICT WHEN MAJOR QUAKES WILL HAPPEN?

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.700
UNFORTUNATELY AT THIS POINT, ONLY VERY VERY
GENERALLY.

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.810
QUAKES ARE CAUSED BY SHIFTING TECTONIC PLATES,
AND THE AREAS MOST AT RISK ARE PLACES THAT

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.690
SIT ALONG THESE FAULT LINES.

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.680
BUT THAT RISK CAN BE AGGRAVATED BY MAN-MADE
FACTORS THAT CAN EXERT EXTRA PRESSURE ON NATURALLY

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.390
OCCURRING SEISMIC ACTIVITY.

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.400
THE BEST KNOWN EXAMPLE OF THIS IS THE Sichuan
PROVINCE OF CHINA, WHICH HAD A MAJOR QUAKE

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.579
IN 2008 THAT'S BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN TRIGGERED
IN PART BY A DAM IN THE AREA.

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:37.770
BECAUSE OF THE MANY POTENTIAL TRIGGERS - WHICH
COULD INCLUDE ANYTHING FROM RESERVOIRS, MINING

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.640
OR FRACKING - SCIENTISTS CAN IDENTIFY PARTS
OF THE WORLD THAT ARE LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.969
A QUAKE, BUT CAN'T SAY WHEN THEY WILL HAPPEN
WITH ANY USEFUL LEVEL OF ACCURACY.

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:48.899
IN FACT, ANIMALS MIGHT BE MUCH BETTER AT SENSING
QUAKES THAN HUMANS.

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:54.600
JUST BEFORE A 2009 QUAKE IN ITALY FOR EXAMPLE,
96% OF MALE TOADS DITCHED THEIR BREEDING SITE

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.640
IN THE AREA JUST DAYS BEFORE THE QUAKE.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.679
BUT CAN WE PREPARE FOR AN EARTHQUAKE...SURE.

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:02.960
IN PLACES LIKE CALIFORNIA OR CHILE THAT BASICALLY
SIT ON ACTIVE FAULTS, LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.920
GOTTEN BETTER AT PREPPING INFRASTRUCTURE - AND
PEOPLE - FOR MAJOR JOLTS.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.510
IN THE BAY AREA FOR EXAMPLE, ENGINEERS SPENT
YEARS RETROFITTING THE BAY BRIDGE TO OAKLAND

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.440
WITH ADDITIONAL DIAGONALS AND OTHER FEATURES
THAT CAN HELP CUSHION AGAINST THE SIDE TO

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.030
SIDE ROCKING THAT CAN CAUSE FAILURE.

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.130
BUT NO MATTER WHERE YOU LIVE, YOU SHOULD KNOW
WHAT NOT TO DO IN THE EVENT OF A QUAKE.

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.320
FEEL FREE TO MILDLY FREAK OUT - LIKE OUR NEWS
ANCHOR FRIENDS - BUT PLEASE RESIST THE URGE

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.690
TO RUN SCREAMING INTO THE STREET DURING AN
EARTHQUAKE, AS OUR INTERN KENNY KINDLY DEMONSTRATES

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:29.690
FOR US HERE.

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.080
YOU'RE MORE LIKELY TO GET HIT WITH FALLING
OBJECTS THAT CAN HARM YOU THAT WAY.

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.750
YOUR BEST BET IS TO DUCK AND COVER UNDER A
DESK OR TABLE, OR STAND IN A DOORWAY.

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.630
IF YOU'RE OUTSIDE, GET OUT IN THE OPEN AWAY
FROM POWER LINES OR OTHER THINGS THAT COULD

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:42.630
FALL ON YOU.

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.020
AND AS WITH ANY POTENTIAL EMERGENCY, IT CAN'T
HURT TO HAVE SOME BASIC SUPPLIES AROUND YOUR

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.850
HOME IN THE EVENT OF POWER FAILURE.

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.600
