00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Now let's look into the communication overhead required by parallel computing.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Assume that we have n-squared course or processors,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
each of which handles its own square of our complete domain.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
The complete domain should consist of l * l cells.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
What would be a reasonable model for the time taken by the computation?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
A constant C by the number of course or processors and squared

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
times the side length of the total domain plus another constant

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
times n times l?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Or constant times l-squared divided by n-squared plus another constant times (n - 1)?

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Or the constant times n times l-squared minus a constant times n times l?

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.000
A constant times l-squared over n-squared plus a constant times (n - 1) times l-squared?

00:00:48.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Pick one.
