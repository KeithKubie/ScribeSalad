1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,070
The Joe Rogan experience. Um, but like I,

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,980
I'm interested as well with this. I keep
bringing up the subject of the empty, uh,

3
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:10,500
like what

4
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:15,570
I guess while I want to know about
is like, cause I, I'm, you know,

5
00:00:15,571 --> 00:00:17,640
obviously a person in recovery, I
don't drink, I don't take drugs,

6
00:00:17,641 --> 00:00:21,810
haven't done for a long time and are
recognized for certain people [inaudible]

7
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,530
they can't do it safely.
Psychedelics and hallucinogens is,

8
00:00:25,531 --> 00:00:28,650
it seemed to me exist in a real mount
side of that because they're not about,

9
00:00:28,651 --> 00:00:32,940
they're not pleasure seeking. There's like
seem to me like it's a spiritual Paul.

10
00:00:32,941 --> 00:00:33,510
However,

11
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:37,650
I'm a crafty bastard when it comes to
this stuff and I'm always looking for an

12
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,090
in, you know, when I see your
cannabis treasure trove over there.

13
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,160
I mean that is some, yeah, as you said,

14
00:00:44,161 --> 00:00:48,720
let Raiders of the lost Ark Stuff and
I'm holding in my hand now the CBD rich

15
00:00:48,721 --> 00:00:51,510
cannabis soft gels class been,
you know,

16
00:00:51,511 --> 00:00:55,260
so like I'm sort of worried
that that is a gateway that CVD,

17
00:00:55,261 --> 00:00:58,730
which is not necessarily
psychoactives psychoactive. It's not,

18
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:01,500
but it does help you with anxiety
and helps a lot of people because it

19
00:01:01,501 --> 00:01:03,660
alleviates a lot of inflammation,

20
00:01:03,661 --> 00:01:08,130
which tends to have a corresponding
impact on, on your anxiety.

21
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,910
I was gonna say, this says here, 11
milligrams of THC. Does that mean,

22
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:16,010
I mean it says THC. It does say that
the bonds are probably a wonder one.

23
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:19,380
This is the one to one or
ed tech 18 to one or 11.

24
00:01:19,381 --> 00:01:22,440
It says there's an 1,101 is a couple
of different ones in that box. Oh,

25
00:01:22,441 --> 00:01:27,000
I give you, almost give you the
wrong one. Show a bag of snack.

26
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:29,790
Don't take that. They swung,
goes back in this one.

27
00:01:29,791 --> 00:01:31,520
This one's way more powerful
than the one to one.

28
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:36,060
You seem to seem very relaxed and free
from anxiety. I will say that. Um,

29
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:39,630
but like say like, oh well I suppose
I'm interested in, because listen,

30
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:42,900
I'm meditating the whole lot. I meditate
a lot. I'm doing all these things.

31
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:45,300
I'm experiencing transcendent states.

32
00:01:45,301 --> 00:01:49,110
I'm experiencing what it's like to not
feel attached to my identity as Russell.

33
00:01:49,111 --> 00:01:50,580
Who are you before you are Russell?

34
00:01:50,581 --> 00:01:55,230
Who are you before you identify yourself
as a man in England? Who are you?

35
00:01:55,231 --> 00:01:57,780
Who is the person who is the
consciousness? Who is the awareness?

36
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:58,681
And when I listened to say,

37
00:01:58,681 --> 00:02:02,580
Terence Mckenna talking about
his experiences in Psychedelia,

38
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:06,390
it's such lamb and with such lucidity
and we've so many philosophical

39
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:10,080
connotations and the way that he uses
the information he's getting from

40
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:14,820
hallucinogenics, um, experiences
to speculate on how we
should organize society,

41
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:17,400
what it,
what the implications are for freedom.

42
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:21,420
He's refusal to accept that there are
certain kinds of experiences that should

43
00:02:21,421 --> 00:02:22,231
be prohibited.

44
00:02:22,231 --> 00:02:24,960
That it's ridiculous that adults
should be prevented from having that.

45
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:29,370
I'm fascinated by. I'm also,
I suppose part of my biases.

46
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:33,570
I love anything that gets me out of my
head. I feel a tremendous sense of relief,

47
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:38,010
whether it's through meditation or even
sport at the or sex being relieved of

48
00:02:38,011 --> 00:02:42,500
the burden of the constantly thinking
mind. But when I hear like those, um,

49
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:47,490
vivid or descriptions of
DMT realm or our West Korea,

50
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:51,060
I think something in me hungers
for that hungers for it.

51
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:54,250
Do you worry that you're trying to get
intoxicated? You worry that you're,

52
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:57,570
you're trying to find a loophole.
Yeah. Cause I am doing that.

53
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,220
I'm Lou palm looking for a loophole.
He's like, I'm going around.

54
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:05,090
I like a so of a trash lawyer looking
for some weight gain. Is there,

55
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:09,130
hold on a second. What about this lawyer?
That's a great way of putting it. Yeah.

56
00:03:09,131 --> 00:03:10,000
I mean,
uh,

57
00:03:10,001 --> 00:03:13,750
I know people that have problems with
addiction that have done psychedelics and

58
00:03:13,751 --> 00:03:14,740
didn't have a problem,

59
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:19,690
but I'm sure some people have had
problems and I don't know about them.

60
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,960
DMT is interesting in that,
first of all, it's very quick.

61
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:27,310
The experience is only about 15
minutes, 20 minutes Max. And it's also,

62
00:03:27,311 --> 00:03:28,900
it's not necessary.

63
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:32,560
It's not an intoxicant in the way that
you would think about traditionally.

64
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:35,800
You are still you in,
in the face of this experience.

65
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:40,150
And I think [inaudible] I think it's
some sort of a chemical gateway.

66
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:41,231
That's what I think.

67
00:03:41,231 --> 00:03:46,150
I think there's a gateway in your mind
that can lead to some other dimension

68
00:03:46,151 --> 00:03:49,300
that's probably there all the
time. If they raise, I, uh,

69
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:55,000
omnipresent continually existing realm
that human beings aren't accessing

70
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,440
because of that particular buyer,

71
00:03:56,441 --> 00:04:00,550
chemical formulation of consciousness
as it is in this point in our evolution

72
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,340
and that we can get there. And
it seems as if like, you know,

73
00:04:03,341 --> 00:04:07,030
I've heard Terence Mckenna say
it's more real. It's more real.

74
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:09,820
They stuff in there. Yeah.
You know, and excuse me.

75
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,500
And when he talks about them beings,
you know,

76
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:14,860
like that he describes
herself dribbling basketballs,

77
00:04:14,861 --> 00:04:19,861
creating life Faberge egg like I devices
fruit vibration and it's easy to do it.

78
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:23,530
I never saw him.
I want this called the machine elves.

79
00:04:23,531 --> 00:04:25,060
He's called them all
sorts of different things.

80
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:29,440
The way I've described them as they're
the geometric patterns made out of love

81
00:04:29,441 --> 00:04:32,950
and understanding. So
like, so you've read,

82
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:36,260
you can look at a geometrical
pattern and read meaning into it.

83
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:40,330
It had an emotional quality. They're
made out of something and they move,

84
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,820
they change.
Like they don't stay what they are.

85
00:04:42,821 --> 00:04:46,150
They're constantly evolving in front
of you into something more and more

86
00:04:46,151 --> 00:04:50,980
beautiful. It's very weird.
What did it make you feel like?

87
00:04:50,981 --> 00:04:54,400
I knew nothing.
There was the most profound aspect,

88
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:58,810
like all of the stuff that you concentrate
on everyday is nonsense and there is

89
00:04:58,811 --> 00:05:03,490
some other thing that's connected
that's probably influencing this world.

90
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,300
Yeah, and it's probably what people see
when they have near death experiences.

91
00:05:07,301 --> 00:05:09,040
The depictions of the afterlife.

92
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:13,210
I mean that's probably what it all is and
religious experiences and when profits

93
00:05:13,211 --> 00:05:16,360
are talking about, oh my God, I went
into this round. There's these beings,

94
00:05:16,361 --> 00:05:18,870
they've told me we're all one.
We have scholars,

95
00:05:18,871 --> 00:05:23,770
other scholars in Jerusalem or connecting
Moses's experience with the burning

96
00:05:23,771 --> 00:05:27,400
Bush to the acacia tree, the
Acacia tree, which is rich and DMT.

97
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:32,230
The burning Bush is with God was to
Moses and that through this burning Bush,

98
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:35,650
he came out with these 10 commandments
of how people should live their lives.

99
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:41,130
I mean that easily could have been just
a very convoluted sort of translation of

100
00:05:43,181 --> 00:05:46,760
a DMT trip. Certainly. And
also when you think of,

101
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,110
certainly there are archetype or images
that seem to be repeated throughout

102
00:05:50,111 --> 00:05:55,111
ancient cultures aren't an archaic stories
that seem to refer to the potential

103
00:05:55,181 --> 00:05:58,280
for plant experiences
to affect consciousness.

104
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:03,310
Even the garden of Eden do not eat of
the fruit of the tree of knowledge,

105
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:08,210
otherwise you will become as gods.
You know, I sent that. Now if,

106
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:12,320
if there is some realm that we
can reach through that experience,

107
00:06:12,321 --> 00:06:16,370
but seeing that puts into perspective
everything that else we experiment on the

108
00:06:16,371 --> 00:06:19,280
material realm and that thing seems to,
in your words,

109
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,790
be m and a in love and
understanding while ever changing,

110
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:26,720
completely formless and communicate
in love and understanding it for,

111
00:06:26,721 --> 00:06:31,721
I can't help but think that that
should become our pri already.

112
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:36,980
To have a relationship with that realm
and to bring about that experience.

113
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:39,030
I don't even mean in a literal way.
Cause even terrorism,

114
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:41,690
Mckenna said there were some
people vulnerable souls.

115
00:06:41,691 --> 00:06:45,320
He was probably referring to people like
me that probably shouldn't mess around

116
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:47,930
with that kind of stuff. Really talking
about people with schizophrenia,

117
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:52,350
which he believed he had, by
the way. Did he? Yeah, he, he,

118
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:56,270
he had some very unique perspectives
on schizophrenia and the,

119
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,970
the way people interact
with the world itself.

120
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:01,580
I think if we lived in a healthy world,
uh,

121
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:04,820
healthy civilization that had a
healthy relationship with psychoactive

122
00:07:04,821 --> 00:07:08,990
substances, we'd probably have centers
where you would have a legitimate Sharman,

123
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:14,120
a medical advisor and someone would
take you through a guided experience.

124
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:17,260
We're doing that now with a ketamine.

125
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:20,300
There's a lot of people that are
very depressed that are having a,

126
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:25,400
these physician controlled
ketamine experiences that
have had a profound effect

127
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:27,920
on their depression.

128
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:30,980
My friend Neil Brendan's gone
through several of them and he was,

129
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:34,140
he's a comedian, a very funny
comedian. So when he was describing it,

130
00:07:34,141 --> 00:07:36,560
it was hilarious.
I was going to a doctor's office,

131
00:07:36,561 --> 00:07:38,840
a tripping his fucking balls off,
you know,

132
00:07:38,841 --> 00:07:43,160
and the doctors shooting them up with
intermuscular ketamine. Oh my God. Yeah.

133
00:07:43,161 --> 00:07:45,470
And he's having these
insane, so yeah, I go,

134
00:07:45,471 --> 00:07:50,300
so you're having psychedelic experiences
like, oh yeah, that's scribing.

135
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:53,210
It was really funny. Um, I mean,

136
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:58,270
tripping his fucking balls off in
these whatever states that ketamine,

137
00:07:59,391 --> 00:08:01,400
I've never experienced ketamine.
I don't know what it does,

138
00:08:01,401 --> 00:08:06,401
but it's apparently profoundly a
hallucinogenic and you have these wild,

139
00:08:06,531 --> 00:08:07,850
crazy experiences on it.

140
00:08:07,851 --> 00:08:12,851
And for whatever reason it has a a
great impact on depression for a lot of

141
00:08:12,921 --> 00:08:14,560
people.
I think it's a perspective enhancer,

142
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:17,030
but it also does something
to rewire the mind.

143
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:21,620
Some of this suggests is that mental
illness is a response to our material

144
00:08:21,621 --> 00:08:24,410
conditions. Whether that's
mentally, honestly schizophrenia,

145
00:08:24,411 --> 00:08:28,970
depression or addiction is like,
like people are going on and on a minute,

146
00:08:28,971 --> 00:08:31,070
this is now we're supposed to live.
I took that,

147
00:08:31,071 --> 00:08:34,700
came in one time towards the
end of my using and as usual,

148
00:08:34,701 --> 00:08:37,130
it's not in the right type of environment
should be doing stuff like that in a

149
00:08:37,131 --> 00:08:39,860
nightclub. You need to be under
that. She manic conditions,

150
00:08:39,861 --> 00:08:42,920
why coke guy or whatever,
who had nominated a shaman,

151
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:47,240
but I felt like it was like going into a
tunnel made of sound and they're having

152
00:08:47,241 --> 00:08:50,430
to navigate. I was like, Oh shit, I'm
still in reality. What am I going to do?

153
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:55,431
Is it is my self consciousness becomes
a noise instead a string of words

154
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,340
and signs. Yeah, mom in a
Gad, his place, you know,

155
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,330
so like for me it's clear that drugs
were never meant to be recreational.

156
00:09:03,331 --> 00:09:06,600
In fact, they never was. I was never,
hey man, this is crazy. I was was like,

157
00:09:06,601 --> 00:09:09,150
I'm fucking pain.
I need some shit to help me out.

158
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:11,480
Otherwise I'm can probably kill myself,
you know?

159
00:09:11,481 --> 00:09:14,670
So like it was a way of
holding that stuff. Arms Limp.

160
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:19,880
So I guess my renewed curiosity around
Dmt in Iowa and Iowa Ska and other sort

161
00:09:20,371 --> 00:09:21,960
of plant medicines and
like, you know, that,

162
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:25,050
do you know Daniel Pinchbeck and like
them guys are sort of part of that?

163
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:28,590
I'm curious about it cause I guess I'm
continually trying to find a way where

164
00:09:28,591 --> 00:09:31,410
someone go, right, here's a way where
we can do it, where it sort of safe.

165
00:09:31,411 --> 00:09:33,540
And I've heard of other
people in recovery doing it.

166
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,350
But when I think about
what my motivation is,

167
00:09:35,351 --> 00:09:39,090
is when I hear people talking about
and my own and my own recollections of

168
00:09:39,091 --> 00:09:40,470
experiencing what felt like God.

169
00:09:40,471 --> 00:09:43,590
And by God I mean a sense of oneness
and that my individual identity isn't my

170
00:09:43,591 --> 00:09:45,390
real identity and I'm
connected to everything.

171
00:09:45,391 --> 00:09:47,610
And love is the most important thing.
You know,

172
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,480
I want a real experience of that
so that when I'm out in the world,

173
00:09:51,481 --> 00:09:55,560
I can remember when I'm driving or when
I'm dealing with people or if I'm buying

174
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:59,280
something or if I'm feeling inferior
or feeling superior that like you said,

175
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:02,730
this is bullshit. This is like a secondary
reality. Don't let it govern you.

176
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,930
You know, as, as someone that's been
seduced by fame or personal life.

177
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:09,210
If I get this of film, then everyone's
going to love me. Oh. If they stand up,

178
00:10:09,211 --> 00:10:10,080
set goes well.
You know,

179
00:10:10,081 --> 00:10:13,410
like I personally placed all of
my wellbeing outside of myself.

180
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,010
There's certain knowledge that there is
an inner connection that will take care

181
00:10:17,011 --> 00:10:19,970
of you. That's accessible.
I guess I'm, you know,

182
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,580
hungry to sort of feel it in a
way that it's like, oh my God,

183
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:26,640
now there is no doubt it's been
in a sense is a crisis of faith,

184
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:31,680
not crisis psychedelic states that you
could achieve without taking anything.

185
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:35,820
I mean, you could certainly get
there, um, in a flotation tank,

186
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:38,690
you could get there through
holotropic breathing. Um,

187
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:41,460
I've never done Kundalini Yoga,

188
00:10:41,461 --> 00:10:44,610
but apparently the people that get
really deep into Kundalini Yoga,

189
00:10:44,611 --> 00:10:46,530
you can literally have DMT trips.

190
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:51,690
I know I have friends that have done DMT
and have experienced DMT trips through

191
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:55,440
Kundalini, but you have to be really
dedicated. I mean, there's a lot of time,

192
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:57,750
a lot of time,
a lot of energy,

193
00:10:57,751 --> 00:11:02,751
and you have to really understand the
methods and follow them to a t and you can

194
00:11:02,821 --> 00:11:07,440
achieve these altered
states of consciousness that
are apparently, you know,

195
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,780
not from my personal experience,
but from what people tell me.

196
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,840
Incredibly profound. Yeah. I
mean, I've had comparable things.

197
00:11:12,841 --> 00:11:14,130
I guess that what you know,

198
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:18,270
the difference between feeling something
that's that overwhelming that gives you

199
00:11:18,271 --> 00:11:21,060
no choice. You know, like there's
like, it's not like in a Kundalini,

200
00:11:21,061 --> 00:11:22,880
you've got to do these breaths correctly.
You've got to sit, there you go.

201
00:11:22,881 --> 00:11:26,710
Try again. He had done a look
quite a bit of Delini well,

202
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,730
what for me it feels like
what I felt quite a lot yoga,

203
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:34,080
clea and meditatively is a cessation
of what I would call my individual

204
00:11:34,081 --> 00:11:37,320
consciousness. Like, Oh, I'm
not this, this isn't who I am.

205
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:41,250
This is just a temporary experience and
all of the value systems of our world

206
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:46,430
are built upon these primal drives in
collaboration with a culture that like the

207
00:11:46,771 --> 00:11:50,820
stratify people and manage people and
operates like a massive farm where it's

208
00:11:50,821 --> 00:11:53,920
easier to keep people together operating
in these kinds wastes systemically.

209
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:58,300
I've sort of felt rushes of that
like a sun wordless clarity.

210
00:11:58,301 --> 00:12:01,690
If you can imagine me having anything
that was wordless even for a moment and

211
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:06,520
like and in that space, you
know there there is great
pace. So I suppose get that.

212
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:08,530
What's turning me on about the,

213
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,370
like the DMT and Iowaska thing is that
the way it's narrow advised that there

214
00:12:12,371 --> 00:12:14,950
you're going to meet characters
and stuff like that and it's,

215
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:17,710
and he's going to be plain
and beyond doubt, you know,

216
00:12:17,711 --> 00:12:22,711
cause I suppose what profits do you
know like whether you know when a profit

217
00:12:22,751 --> 00:12:26,350
returned from there,
whether it's the burning Bush or the cave,

218
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:30,310
they come back and they say all this
stuff that you'll take it seriously is not

219
00:12:30,311 --> 00:12:31,930
real.
There's this other realm.

220
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:35,980
Start prioritizing it or you are
going to live in hell on earth,

221
00:12:35,981 --> 00:12:38,290
you're going to be governed
by your materialistic drives,

222
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:40,510
your sexual drive and it's
going to imprison you.

223
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:44,170
And it turns out that they're
bright as I would like, you know,

224
00:12:44,171 --> 00:12:48,460
I suppose what I'm after because I'm
partly, you know, on a superfood,

225
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:52,060
like on one level influenced by what
you're doing and how you've created your

226
00:12:52,061 --> 00:12:55,180
own light, your creating your own
business and your own success. Like these,

227
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:58,270
this symbiosis of stand up
and the podcast and like,

228
00:12:58,271 --> 00:13:01,870
it's become like a sort of a lifestyle
brand in a sense. Joe. Like, you know,

229
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:02,980
I'm sort of like, yeah, I don't,

230
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:05,790
I don't want to be continually
dragged in at these colors,

231
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:09,880
like working within institutions. Like,
you know, I'm over here doing a bloody,

232
00:13:09,881 --> 00:13:13,390
I'm doing ballers and I'm bloody glad to
be over here doing ballers and working

233
00:13:13,391 --> 00:13:18,070
with the rock. And I've got a funny
story about that if you want it like, um,

234
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:22,270
but like, uh, you know, like really
what interests me is like, can I be,

235
00:13:22,271 --> 00:13:25,780
and can I dedicate my life to humorously,

236
00:13:25,781 --> 00:13:30,490
communicate in spiritual information
and indeed starting to live it.

237
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:33,580
So like that. And I suppose
what that would mean is, you
know, I'm getting better,

238
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:37,840
but I'm not a person who's obsessed
with porn or sex or drugs or web, like,

239
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,840
you know, to become it, to
become what you actually are,

240
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:42,160
to recognize that we are all different.

241
00:13:42,161 --> 00:13:46,360
Your perfect realization of you is
going to involve hun in and all of these

242
00:13:46,361 --> 00:13:48,220
things that you've
created through your gift.

243
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:50,950
And that my perfect version of me
is going to involve all of this.

244
00:13:50,951 --> 00:13:53,830
And not everyone needs to build sort of
empires or entertainment industries or

245
00:13:53,831 --> 00:13:54,221
whatever.

246
00:13:54,221 --> 00:13:58,400
But all of us are on some journey to
self actualization and realization.

247
00:13:58,401 --> 00:14:01,570
There's individual as our fingerprints
and as natural as a seed turn in with

248
00:14:01,571 --> 00:14:05,150
tree. And if we don't have
a way of accessing that, no
wonder with dissatisfied,

249
00:14:05,151 --> 00:14:07,630
satisfied, no wonder we tie. There's
an opioid epidemic. They want to,

250
00:14:07,631 --> 00:14:10,000
people are bored and angry and lonely.
Yeah.

251
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:14,360
Well,
I think what you can do is be yourself.

252
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,100
And what you can do is express yourself.

253
00:14:16,101 --> 00:14:18,920
And what you can do is constantly
seek to improve and grow.

254
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:22,700
And you are doing those things. So if
you're saying, can I do these things?

255
00:14:22,701 --> 00:14:27,280
Can I be comedic and spiritual and
what you're doing it right. So, so,

256
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:31,250
so it's don't, you're doing it, you
know, it's all just a matter of what,

257
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:35,720
whether or not your satisfied with your
progress and where you are and who you

258
00:14:35,721 --> 00:14:37,040
are and how you express yourself.
