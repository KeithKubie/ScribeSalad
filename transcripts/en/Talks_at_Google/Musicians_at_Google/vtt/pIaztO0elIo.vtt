00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:09.480
SPEAKER: OK, hello everyone.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.070
Thank you all for
coming this afternoon.

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.160
Dr. Paul Cohen is one of
America's most distinguished

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.900
classical saxophonist.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.622
Having appeared as a soloist
for the San Francisco

00:00:20.622 --> 00:00:22.580
Symphony, the Richmond
Symphony, the New Jersey

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.590
symphony, and many others.

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.350
He has published over 100
articles on the history

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:29.960
and lost literature of the
saxophone in prestigious music

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.250
journals.

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.260
His company To the
Four Publishers,

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.390
publishes repertoire
for saxophone ensembles

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:36.830
of all sizes.

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:40.130
Dr. Cohen frequently presents
lectures on the saxophone,

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.130
illustrating his talks with
rare instruments, manuscripts,

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.850
and archival material from his
extensive private collection.

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.640
Dr. Cohen holds
MM and DMA degrees

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.550
from the Manhattan
School of Music.

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.970
His teachers have included
Galon [INAUDIBLE] Joe Allard,

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:57.710
and Sigurd Rascher.

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.140
He is currently on the faculty
of the Manhattan School

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.480
of Music, the Mason Grove
School of the Arts, Rutgers

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.090
University, New York
University, Columbia University,

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.570
and the Aaron Copland School
of Music at Queens College.

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.790
So without further ado,
everyone give a warm

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.794
welcome to Doctor Paul Cohen.

00:01:16.794 --> 00:01:17.710
PAUL COHEN: Thank you.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.330
Thanks, very excited to be here.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.810
I assume that everybody in
the audience is a saxophonist?

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:27.991
Is that right?

00:01:27.991 --> 00:01:28.490
Yes?

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.090
Good.

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.440
Well, I thought I'd
start out by taking pity

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.810
on all of us saxophonists.

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.770
Throughout the years, we have
been given so many labels

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:43.490
and ascribed so many
different things.

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.285
Either we have been deified--

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.520
that's the original, by the way.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.857
The early ones you see,
they were Fresco shops

00:01:53.857 --> 00:01:54.940
to take out the saxophone.

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.620
But this is the original.

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:01.710
Or we have been vilified, as we
see a poster from Nazi Germany

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.240
where the saxophone was the
object of the degenerate art

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.850
music that was banned.

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.830
Or we have been embraced as
part of American culture,

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.510
as Norman Rockwell's "Saturday
Evening Post" magazine cover

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.340
from 1929.

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.270
Or we've been mysticized.

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:31.030
Or sometimes just part of
good old American culture.

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.000
But many of us don't really
understand where saxophone

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.220
came from or what it's about.

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.590
The saxophone was invented
by Adolphe Sax around 1840.

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.870
He was a Belgian
who moved to Paris,

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.760
and his intent was to make an
instrument for the orchestra.

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.080
Not for the jazz band, not
for the marching bands,

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.340
not for the military bands,
but for the orchestra.

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.470
And indeed, when he
made his saxophone,

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.310
he conceived of them
as a whole family.

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.700
Here is his original
sax patent of 1846,

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.480
which shows all of the different
sizes he was thinking of.

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:16.780
And they start out from
sopranino, to soprano, to alto,

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:25.510
to tenor, to baritone,
to bass, to contrabass.

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.120
And he spoke at length
of what his intent was

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.590
for making the saxophone.

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.950
He said, struck by the
various inconveniences,

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.340
I have been
searching for a means

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.330
to amend these by creating
an instrument which,

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.800
by the very character
of its voice,

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.450
approaches the
string instruments,

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:48.870
but which possesses much more
power and intensity than these.

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.310
This instrument
is the saxophone.

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.280
More than any other
instrument, the saxophone

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.134
is susceptible to
modify its tone in order

00:03:55.134 --> 00:03:56.550
to give it the
mentioned qualities

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:00.450
and to conserve a perfect
evenness over its entire range.

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.310
I made them out of
copper, and in the shape

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:03.790
of a parabolic cone.

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.030
For embouchure the
saxophone is a mouthpiece

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.490
with a single reed, the
interior of which is expressly

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:10.860
bell shaped and that contracts
towards the part, which

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.690
it adapts to the body
of the instrument.

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.760
He's saying that he
made an instrument that

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.931
will have aspects of the
string instruments, aspects

00:04:16.931 --> 00:04:18.930
of the woodwind instruments,
aspect of the brass

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.050
instruments, and with the
technical construction

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:23.020
of a conical bore
and a mouthpiece

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.190
of a certain shape to give
it this orchestral quality.

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.150
That was what he
intended for it.

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.680
Here's a contemporary showing
of the Saxophone family.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.450
All the instruments from
sopranino to bass, and this

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:40.189
belongs to Sigurd Rascher,
a very famous saxophone

00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:42.480
pioneer who lived in this
country for many, many years.

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:50.100
We don't know what
happened from that.

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.440
The saxophone had its early
start in the orchestra.

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.070
It was featured in an opera
by Halevy in the 1840s.

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:59.310
More famously we know a
piece by Georges Bizet,

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:02.910
the "L'Ariesienne
Suites" from the 1870s.

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:06.450
In opera, we have
Hamlet by Thomas,

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:09.910
and we have [INAUDIBLE]
by Massenet.

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:12.210
And then in the 20th
century, we have many pieces.

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:14.360
Some by Ravel,
some by Prokofiev,

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.950
some by Rachmaninoff,
some by Aaron Copland.

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:19.950
And it has had a small
but distinguished role

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:21.720
in the orchestra.

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:27.390
It also became part of the
military bands in France.

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:31.860
And it became very, very popular
as a wind band instrument.

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.550
In this country in the 1870s
through the result of Charles

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:37.410
Lefevbre from Europe
coming to this country

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:39.870
and being in the Gilmore,
and then the Sousa bands,

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:42.480
the saxophone began to become
a very popular instrument

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:45.690
in the United States
starting from the 1870s.

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:47.970
So much so that the Conn
company from Elkhart, Indiana

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:50.260
began making their
own instruments.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:54.330
The first American made
instruments in the early 1890s.

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:58.650
And it became somewhat of a
very, very popular instrument.

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:02.160
Jazz didn't arrive on the
scene until the 19 teens.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.190
We're talking the 1890s.

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:08.420
The instrument was so popular
that it was used in churches.

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:11.100
It was used in community bands,
saxophone quartets, vaudeville,

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:13.702
some burlesque, the
Chautauqua circuit.

00:06:13.702 --> 00:06:15.660
All these things around
the turn of the century

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:20.510
became fertile venues for
the saxophone to be used.

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:27.160
And the saxophone was also
an agent of social progress.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.240
Because in the
1880s and '90s, we

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:34.040
had women become professional
saxophone soloists.

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:35.810
This is Bessie Mecklem.

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:41.870
She and her uncle formed
a harp and saxophone

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:43.800
duet in New Jersey.

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.600
And they toured
regionally for many years.

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.600
It was a professional ensemble.

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.120
Women really making
it in a profession

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:53.300
that most people had
just assigned to men.

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:58.160
In fact, Bessie was the
first saxophonist to record.

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:04.790
In 1892 she made 10 cylinder
sides at the Edison Studios

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:07.550
in West Orange, New Jersey.

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:09.550
The first saxophonist
to record was a woman.

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:14.090
Later on at the
turn of the century,

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:17.300
we had women saxophone quartets.

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:20.480
These are the Schuster sisters
from St. Louis promoting

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:25.330
for the Conn company from 1904.

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:30.300
And this group toured
for quite a while,

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:33.970
and was one of any number
of women who were doing it

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:36.465
as a profession on the
saxophone in the early part

00:07:36.465 --> 00:07:37.090
of the century.

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:45.110
As the saxophone continued to
increase in its popularity,

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:51.380
it became more involved in
community bands, ragtime music,

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:57.110
show music, and then
in the late 19 teens,

00:07:57.110 --> 00:08:02.630
it became a late comer to
this new music called jazz.

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:05.360
And then once it
became to be identified

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:07.234
into jazz in the
early 1920s, it became

00:08:07.234 --> 00:08:08.900
one of the predominant
jazz instruments.

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:11.150
But again, somewhat
of a late comer

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:16.439
to jazz compared to the cornet,
compared to the clarinet,

00:08:16.439 --> 00:08:17.480
compared to the trombone.

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:24.939
As I continue with this lecture,
this kind of breezy involvement

00:08:24.939 --> 00:08:26.480
in the saxophone,
I want to encourage

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:29.150
you to ask any questions you may
have about any of these things.

00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:30.230
There's certainly a
lot of information

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:31.063
we're talking about.

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:36.944
So as we start to see the varied
ways that the saxophone was

00:08:36.944 --> 00:08:39.750
used, we shouldn't be so much
pitying the saxophone for being

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:41.970
pigeonholed into this
or that, but really

00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:47.205
kind of amazed at how many
different venues the saxophone

00:08:47.205 --> 00:08:49.020
was used in, and is
still used today.

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:57.610
As the saxophone
was a new instrument

00:08:57.610 --> 00:09:02.020
and not encumbered by traditions
of centuries as the other wind

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:06.010
instruments had, it
was not rigid to how

00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:08.650
the instrument was to be
conceived, or designed,

00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:10.930
or made, or sounded.

00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:16.120
It was a fertile ground for
experimentation and innovation,

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:18.040
not unlike the Google
culture that I've

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:20.530
been fortunate to visit today.

00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:23.350
So I thought I would show
you some of the experiments

00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:28.230
and some of the innovations
that took place.

00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:34.300
Before then, I wanted to
just play an audio clip.

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:37.970
As today we are always
looking for the most advanced,

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:42.910
the most technologically
innovative either circuitry,

00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:47.350
or software, or gadget that
will make things easy to do,

00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:51.910
I thought I'd play for you
a very, very early clip

00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:56.230
of a saxophonist from 1899
playing on a very, very

00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:57.050
old saxophone.

00:09:57.050 --> 00:09:58.770
A state of the art
instrument of its time

00:09:58.770 --> 00:10:00.400
that, if we were
to see today, we

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:01.880
could hardly play
a C scale on it.

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:04.480
It would be so awkward,
it would be so tight,

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:06.410
it would be so difficult to do.

00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:11.170
But I wanted to show you what
these people could play on,

00:10:11.170 --> 00:10:14.290
these antiquated
old instruments.

00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:23.170
So we're going to be
hearing Jean Moeremans, who

00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:25.180
was a saxophonist
with Sousa Band,

00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:27.660
at the very early part
of the 20th century,

00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:31.000

one here as well?

gone a bit softer.

[INAUDIBLE]

00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:00.357
Now, that's amazing that someone
could play on that instrument.

00:13:00.357 --> 00:13:02.690
That's the equivalent today
of our having a regular work

of what we are using now

with our internet speeds.

00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:11.110
So it's really
fascinating for me

00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:14.320
to hear somebody play at a
virtuoso level on instruments

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:18.280
that look to our eyes and
ears to be so primitive,

00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:20.710
yet to them was state of
the art manufacturing.

00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:24.760
What they could do with it then
is really quite remarkable.

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:27.400
And that's what the saxophone
sounded like at that time.

I thought to play for you yet
another early, early clip.

This is the earliest commercial
saxophone recording we have.

00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:47.680
Eugene Coffin was considered
the Kenny G of his day.

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:50.500
He was a very popular
performing artist.

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:53.310
So popular, in fact,
that he was one

00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:56.640
of the guest artists for William
McKinley's inauguration, which

00:13:56.640 --> 00:14:00.174
may explain something
about his presidency.

00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:10.530
called Sea Flower Polka.

dazzling triple tonguing.

Thank you, Eugene Coffin.

00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:01.240
Now we come back to the
innovations of the saxophone.

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:06.660
In the post World War I
economic and social euphoria,

00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:11.050
in the roaring '20s, there
were no holds barred.

00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:15.320
As people were feeling economic
prosperity that was unrivaled,

00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:17.069
and they were searching
out more and more,

00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:19.829
and technology was becoming
more and more prevalent.

00:17:19.829 --> 00:17:21.869
It was a wholesale
change in lifestyle,

00:17:21.869 --> 00:17:24.460
and entertainment,
and expectations.

00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:27.150
The saxophone was right
in the middle of this.

00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:33.170
As vaudeville and other
entertainment venues

00:17:33.170 --> 00:17:34.690
were becoming more
and more popular,

00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:36.752
and were reaching
more and more people,

00:17:36.752 --> 00:17:38.210
there was an attempt
to try to find

00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:41.030
more and more ways
to reach a very

00:17:41.030 --> 00:17:45.950
hungry population for novelty.

00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:50.660
One of the more interesting
ones was the slide saxophone

00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:56.570
made by Reiffel and
Husted in Chicago in 1926.

00:17:56.570 --> 00:17:59.330
This is what you
would think it is.

00:17:59.330 --> 00:18:03.251
It's a slide saxophone.

00:18:03.251 --> 00:18:05.000
This, of course, comes
from my collection.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.180
And I'll show you a little
clip as to what it sounds like.

00:18:12.164 --> 00:18:15.152
[MUSIC PLAYS]

00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:48.980
The practicality
of the instrument

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:53.930
was such that they
didn't make many of them.

00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:57.050
It became instantly rare,
a wonderful collectible,

00:18:57.050 --> 00:19:00.980
and an interesting example of
how innovations didn't always

00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:01.742
make it to market.

00:19:01.742 --> 00:19:03.200
Something that I
understand is also

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:05.930
part of the Google culture.

00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:09.860
So we can celebrate
this some 100 years ago.

00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:13.100
Some innovations,
though, worked very well.

00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:17.630
In 1929, the Conn
Company, out of nowhere,

00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:20.810
came with the
amazing Conn-o-Sax.

00:19:20.810 --> 00:19:23.130
This is an
extraordinary saxophone

00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:25.970
that's pitched not in the
key of e-flat like an alto,

00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:29.510
but the key of F,
like an English horn.

00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:32.690
And with its novel shape, but
with an extended key range--

00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:35.770
from low A to high G
instead of the typical low B

00:19:35.770 --> 00:19:37.220
flat to high F--

00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:42.110
it produced a visual novelty
and a tonal novelty that

00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:43.370
is capturing an enchanting.

you a little excerpt of what

00:19:47.455 --> 00:19:48.580

PAUL COHEN: Yeah, it has
a bulb at the bottom.

00:22:09.090 --> 00:22:13.350
And we think that that adds
to the acoustical nature of it

00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:16.140
to give it that little
haunting darker woodish

00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:18.780
quality of an English horn.

00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:22.680
Sad tale of the Conn-o-sax,
it was made in 1929 right

00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:24.810
when the depression
was coming, and right

00:22:24.810 --> 00:22:28.650
when there was a sea change in
the whole economic and social

00:22:28.650 --> 00:22:30.666
aspect of America.

00:22:30.666 --> 00:22:32.040
Conn made a
brilliant instrument,

00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:36.300
but they miscalculated in
marketing a little bit.

00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:38.850
They put it in the
key of F, not E flat,

00:22:38.850 --> 00:22:42.540
which guarantee that there
was no music written for it.

00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:44.760
They priced it as expensive
as a regular saxophone,

00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:46.920
so you had to pay a
considerable amount of money

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:49.350
to be able to buy one.

00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:53.070
They advertised it as a
vaudevillian instrument.

00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:54.905
They showed people of
it dancing like this,

00:22:54.905 --> 00:22:56.530
and having around
there, and they said,

00:22:56.530 --> 00:22:59.605
you have to have this novelty
instrument for your act.

00:22:59.605 --> 00:23:01.790
Well, there were no more acts.

00:23:01.790 --> 00:23:04.410
Vaudeville was in steep decline.

00:23:04.410 --> 00:23:08.160
Entertainment which was changing
with the advent of talkies--

00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:10.860
we call them sound
movies these days--

00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:15.780
and more extensive
radio highways.

00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:19.230
And records now that
were more than the wax

00:23:19.230 --> 00:23:22.067
cylinders, and more than
just the acoustic '78s.

00:23:22.067 --> 00:23:24.150
Everything was changing
about what we were hearing

00:23:24.150 --> 00:23:26.108
and what we expected from
music, not to mention

00:23:26.108 --> 00:23:28.440
the ascendancy of jazz.

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:30.960
So they made a great
instrument, marketed it poorly,

00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:34.170
made it expensive, made it
impractical because of the key,

00:23:34.170 --> 00:23:36.540
and put it out on the market.

00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:39.262
They advertised
it for six months.

00:23:39.262 --> 00:23:40.470
And then we lose sight of it.

00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:44.220
We would find that buried in
catalogs for another 10 years.

00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:49.440
As such, we know of only perhaps
25 of these to still exist.

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:53.220
And you heard one of
them from my collection.

00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:57.960
So again, remarkably
innovative and boldly produced

00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:00.980
instruments, but did not have
the effect that it wanted.

00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:08.310
As opposed to Billy True.

00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:12.430
Billy True was a musician in the
1920s who was a regular roving

00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:13.540
musician.

00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:17.380
He later went back to
work at the company

00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:21.010
that his father worked
in, the Wheeling Steel

00:24:21.010 --> 00:24:24.880
Factory, a giant complex
on the Monongahela River

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:26.140
in West Virginia.

00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:28.480
But he kept up his
saxophone interests

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:29.790
in a very different way.

00:24:33.850 --> 00:24:39.660
Billy True found a way to
play three saxophones at once.

00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:42.300
He did that by modifying
three saxophones

00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:48.270
from the Conn company, two
altos and one C melody.

00:24:48.270 --> 00:24:50.040
And you can't see
it so well on this.

00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:58.320
But at the bottom here is a
platform, you have foot pedals.

00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:02.610
He's able to manipulate the
keys for the middle saxophone

00:25:02.610 --> 00:25:04.200
with the foot pedals.

00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:06.504
And with extended
key work on one hand

00:25:06.504 --> 00:25:08.170
and extended key work
on the other hand,

00:25:08.170 --> 00:25:11.940
he could play the full range
of all three saxophones.

00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:13.598
Something very practical.

00:25:16.350 --> 00:25:19.590
And he did this in
the 1930s and '40s

00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:21.210
as part of a hobby,
and part of his

00:25:21.210 --> 00:25:23.740
reaching out professionally.

00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:26.790
Do you want to know
what it sounded like?

00:25:26.790 --> 00:25:28.579
No?

and there were variety shows,

00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:47.910
and there were all kinds of
entertainments on the radio.

00:25:47.910 --> 00:25:49.030
Why radio?

00:25:49.030 --> 00:25:52.920
They hadn't perfected
internet streaming yet,

00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:57.480

still being experimented with.

how you blow three
saxophones, but Billy,

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.617
how do you play them?

00:27:17.617 --> 00:27:20.371
BILLY TRUE: I play two of
the saxophones with my hands,

00:27:20.371 --> 00:27:22.423
and the third
saxophone with my feet.

00:27:22.423 --> 00:27:23.923
RADIO ANNOUNCER:
With your shoes on?

00:27:23.923 --> 00:27:24.670
BILLY TRUE: Well, yes!

00:27:24.670 --> 00:27:26.438
RADIO ANNOUNCER: Well
Billy, perhaps I better

00:27:26.438 --> 00:27:28.544
stop asking so many
questions and let you get out

00:27:28.544 --> 00:27:29.752
of this predicament yourself.

00:27:29.752 --> 00:27:30.490
Try it.

00:27:30.490 --> 00:27:33.400
BILLY TRUE: I play two of
the saxophones with my hands.

00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:36.310
On those two horns, I
have added extra keys

00:27:36.310 --> 00:27:38.644
making it possible to
play each with one hand.

00:27:38.644 --> 00:27:39.460
RADIO ANNOUNCER: Well now
that's two out of three,

00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:40.737
and a mighty good [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:40.737 --> 00:27:43.222
But playing the third
saxophone with shoes on's

00:27:43.222 --> 00:27:44.713
going to be interesting.

00:27:44.713 --> 00:27:46.879
BILLY TRUE: I've worked out
a mechanical arrangement

00:27:46.879 --> 00:27:49.719
of foot pedals so that with my
feet I can play all the notes.

00:27:49.719 --> 00:27:50.677
RADIO ANNOUNCER: I see.

00:27:50.677 --> 00:27:52.665
You blow the saxophone
with your mouth,

00:27:52.665 --> 00:27:54.653
and finger the keys
with your feet.

00:27:54.653 --> 00:27:57.138
Well all right, Billy,
let's hear you play them.

00:27:57.138 --> 00:27:59.623
Going onto the stand on
which he has the three

00:27:59.623 --> 00:28:02.605
separate saxophones just like
you see them in any orchestra.

00:28:02.605 --> 00:28:04.593
the one he plays with
his feet is in the middle

00:28:04.593 --> 00:28:06.217
and has wires going
all over the place.

00:28:06.217 --> 00:28:08.569
And if he ever figured
out which wire is which,

00:28:08.569 --> 00:28:11.551
we'll have [INAUDIBLE]
for backup.

00:28:11.551 --> 00:28:14.036
Well, he's signaled
that he's ready.

00:28:14.036 --> 00:28:19.006
Here goes three saxophones
played at one time by one man.

00:28:19.006 --> 00:28:21.988
[MUSIC PLAYS]

00:28:58.020 --> 00:28:59.760
Thank you, Billy True.

00:29:05.810 --> 00:29:08.280
PAUL COHEN: And
thank you Billy True.

00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:11.100
So that's the kind of innovation
that you don't often see.

00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:13.850
And I have to tell you, I
own these instruments now.

00:29:13.850 --> 00:29:17.222
The picture was taken from
my little museum in my home.

00:29:17.222 --> 00:29:20.150
The design is amazing,
and the craftsmanship

00:29:20.150 --> 00:29:22.100
in getting this to
work is stunning.

00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:24.325
Not to mention having to
develop an embouchure that

00:29:24.325 --> 00:29:26.075
can accommodate three
mouthpieces at once.

00:29:26.075 --> 00:29:28.080
Now that takes training.

00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:32.370
So there's uncommon dedication
for a very limited and unique

00:29:32.370 --> 00:29:32.870
usage.

00:29:37.810 --> 00:29:40.450
As we're talking about
C melodies and altos

00:29:40.450 --> 00:29:43.810
from the 1920s, I thought
to show you some instruments

00:29:43.810 --> 00:29:46.060
that I brought with me that
are a little bit different

00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:48.440
than what you might expect.

00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:50.772
We all know about the
soprano saxophone.

00:29:50.772 --> 00:29:52.480
And most of us know
the soprano saxophone

00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:55.990
as being the small, straight
member of the saxophone family.

00:29:55.990 --> 00:29:59.590
But many of us don't realize
that the soprano saxophone

00:29:59.590 --> 00:30:03.080
was made in different
shapes, if not sizes.

00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:08.620
And beyond the straight one,
we have ones that are curved.

00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:09.520
They look like this.

00:30:17.177 --> 00:30:21.170
This Is a venerable
curved soprano from 1925,

00:30:21.170 --> 00:30:25.430
made by the Busher Company
from Elkhart, Indiana.

00:30:25.430 --> 00:30:27.080
These have a
different sound than

00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:31.430
the commercial straight
instruments of our time.

00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:35.750
And when played with
the right mouthpiece

00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:38.604
to get more of a classical
tone, it can sound like this.

00:30:38.604 --> 00:30:40.020
And let's see if
you can recognize

00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:41.418
the piece I'm playing.

00:30:41.418 --> 00:30:44.412
[MUSIC PLAYS]

00:31:28.350 --> 00:31:29.949
Anybody recognize that?

00:31:29.949 --> 00:31:30.740
AUDIENCE: "Bolero?"

00:31:30.740 --> 00:31:31.615
PAUL COHEN: "Bolero."

00:31:31.615 --> 00:31:33.350
And that's an actual
saxophone solo

00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:35.870
that's in "Bolero," along with
every other orchestral wind

00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:38.060
instrument.

00:31:38.060 --> 00:31:44.474
And it was written in
the late 1920s by Ravel.

00:31:44.474 --> 00:31:46.640
It's become one of the more
popular orchestra works.

00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:49.250
And that was written
for the saxophone.

00:31:49.250 --> 00:31:52.070
And you're hearing it in a
curved saxophone with a very

00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:54.710
classical mouthpiece to give it
more of an orchestral quality.

00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:56.210
A very different
sound that we often

00:31:56.210 --> 00:31:58.650
hear the soprano in the
commercial pop and jazz

00:31:58.650 --> 00:31:59.150
contexts.

00:32:01.710 --> 00:32:05.140
But Adolphe Sax
didn't stop there,

00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:08.150
because he also made
an instrument higher

00:32:08.150 --> 00:32:09.170
than the soprano.

00:32:09.170 --> 00:32:10.583
And that would be the sopranino.

00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:17.260
Most of the time when
you see the sopranino--

00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:19.720
if you ever see the sopranino,
and I hope for your sakes

00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:21.700
that you don't see
the sopranino often.

00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:23.410
But most of the times
when you see it,

00:32:23.410 --> 00:32:24.535
it's a straight instrument.

00:32:24.535 --> 00:32:25.900
It's a very tiny instrument.

00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:31.900
But some of us have
ones that are curved.

00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:34.450
And this little pest
of an instrument

00:32:34.450 --> 00:32:37.160
is as cute to look
at as it is to play.

00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:40.450
But I'm also going to play for
you an orchestral excerpt that

00:32:40.450 --> 00:32:43.809
was originally written
for the sopranino.

00:32:43.809 --> 00:32:45.850
But when you hear today
in other instrumentation,

00:32:45.850 --> 00:32:47.110
you won't hear the sopranino.

00:32:47.110 --> 00:32:50.530
Let's see if you can
identify this piece.

00:32:50.530 --> 00:32:53.610
Here's a hint, it's
also from the 1920s.

00:32:53.610 --> 00:32:56.980
An orchestral work.

00:32:56.980 --> 00:32:59.968
[MUSIC PLAYS]

00:33:26.834 --> 00:33:28.000
Anyone heard of that before?

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:28.500
Thank you.

00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:31.030
[APPLAUSE]

00:33:31.030 --> 00:33:32.770
Yes, "Rhapsody in Blue."

00:33:32.770 --> 00:33:35.437
The famous "Rhapsody in
Blue" by George Gershwin

00:33:35.437 --> 00:33:37.270
was originally written
for the Paul Whiteman

00:33:37.270 --> 00:33:39.340
band, Paul Whiteman's
jazz band as part

00:33:39.340 --> 00:33:43.690
of an experiment in modern
music from the 1924 Aeolian Hall

00:33:43.690 --> 00:33:44.710
concert.

00:33:44.710 --> 00:33:48.460
And for that combination
of Paul Whiteman's band,

00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:49.880
he had a sopranino saxophone.

00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:51.940
And that piece
was scored for it.

00:33:51.940 --> 00:33:55.990
Later on, Ferde Grofe, who was
the arranger of the work who

00:33:55.990 --> 00:33:59.200
was the one who orchestrated it,
made a version for orchestra.

00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:01.570
And he took out all the
colorful jazz instruments

00:34:01.570 --> 00:34:05.350
and more colorful sounding
less common instruments,

00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:07.390
and replaced them with
oboes, and bassoons,

00:34:07.390 --> 00:34:09.144
and other instruments.

00:34:09.144 --> 00:34:11.560
And now the original version
is being played more and more

00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:12.280
often.

00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:14.219
You can actually hear
the sopranino chirp

00:34:14.219 --> 00:34:16.929
in with that about 2/3
of the way through.

00:34:16.929 --> 00:34:22.270
So this is the E flat sopranino
in its cute curved version.

00:34:22.270 --> 00:34:26.409
It's an octave higher
than the alto saxophone.

00:34:26.409 --> 00:34:30.412
And I'm conducting a large
saxophone choir on Saturday

00:34:30.412 --> 00:34:31.370
at Stanford University.

00:34:31.370 --> 00:34:35.110
If you want to hear these in
abundance, gather your courage

00:34:35.110 --> 00:34:38.170
and come out and hear a whole
choir of saxophones playing,

00:34:38.170 --> 00:34:43.761
including the sopranino, all
the way down to the contrabass.

00:34:43.761 --> 00:34:44.469
Well let's go on.

00:34:47.310 --> 00:34:50.504
I talk a lot throughout
the country about saxophone

00:34:50.504 --> 00:34:52.710
and its history, but
rarely do I have a chance

00:34:52.710 --> 00:34:57.699
to talk to an audience whose
mission is in innovation.

00:34:57.699 --> 00:34:59.490
So I'm enjoying the
opportunity bringing up

00:34:59.490 --> 00:35:01.017
aspects of the
saxophone's history

00:35:01.017 --> 00:35:02.850
where there were
innovations that were going

00:35:02.850 --> 00:35:05.070
on 100 years ago, 80 years ago.

00:35:05.070 --> 00:35:08.100
And we've talked about
some of them in the past.

00:35:08.100 --> 00:35:11.880
I'm very happy to now show you
yet another one that failed.

00:35:15.530 --> 00:35:21.590
Around 1940, the Selmer
Company, an agent

00:35:21.590 --> 00:35:25.460
had a company in
the United States,

00:35:25.460 --> 00:35:30.350
came up with the
padless saxophone.

00:35:30.350 --> 00:35:33.340
This is a saxophone that doesn't
have traditional pads that

00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:39.590
cover the holes, but it has
metal disks instead of pads.

00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:49.370
So these metal disks would
then descend on leather gaskets

00:35:49.370 --> 00:35:51.800
to create the seal.

00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:54.320
In many ways, this is
a very innovative idea.

00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:56.630
Because it had certain
technical expediencies

00:35:56.630 --> 00:35:59.420
that could allow
us to play more.

00:35:59.420 --> 00:36:00.950
It didn't really
work out that way.

00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:04.030
And I'm going to show you
this by playing a clip.

00:36:04.030 --> 00:36:08.510
This clip I'm going to play
you is unfortunately overlaid

00:36:08.510 --> 00:36:11.300
with my voice, because it was
part of a CD that was done.

00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:14.270
So in order to best appreciate
what happened with this,

00:36:14.270 --> 00:36:18.170
you're going to have to
hear me speaking on the clip

00:36:18.170 --> 00:36:20.190
as you hear the
padless saxophone.

00:36:21.705 --> 00:36:24.330
PAUL COHEN (ON RECORDING): These
innovative instruments, called

00:36:24.330 --> 00:36:27.100
Selmer USAs, do not have pads.

00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:29.860
In place are flat
and thin metal disks.

00:36:29.860 --> 00:36:32.590
The tone holes themselves are
line with a leather gasket

00:36:32.590 --> 00:36:35.660
that provides the seal
when the key is closed.

00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:38.390
In theory, this provides
a faster, truer action

00:36:38.390 --> 00:36:40.730
and eliminates pad
wear and regulation.

00:36:40.730 --> 00:36:43.659
In practice, though, the leather
gasket proved problematic.

00:36:43.659 --> 00:36:45.950
As it dried out, it no longer
retained its supple shape

00:36:45.950 --> 00:36:47.740
and sealing capacity.

00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:50.125
Unless you replaced the
leather gaskets regularly,

00:36:50.125 --> 00:36:52.166
the result was an increasingly
leaking instrument

00:36:52.166 --> 00:36:54.124
whose key noise made it
difficult for recording

00:36:54.124 --> 00:36:55.355
and radio broadcasting.

00:36:55.355 --> 00:37:03.600
[CLATTERING SOUNDS]

00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:05.948
PAUL COHEN: And so went
the padless saxophone.

00:37:09.370 --> 00:37:13.550
At the end of World War
II, because of the research

00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:16.350
and the war effort for materials
to help with the war effort,

00:37:16.350 --> 00:37:20.030
this brand new material
burst on the scene.

00:37:20.030 --> 00:37:21.880
I feel like I'm
in "The Graduate."

00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:25.070
It was plastic.

00:37:25.070 --> 00:37:30.200
Plastic was a brand new element,
and one innovative Englishman

00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:32.870
thought to use this new plastic
material for a saxophone.

00:37:32.870 --> 00:37:36.320
And he came out with the
remarkable Grafton Plastic

00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:36.820
Alto.

00:37:36.820 --> 00:37:39.500
For those of you who know a
little about saxophone lore,

00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:43.730
the Grafton Plastic is
a very story of one.

00:37:43.730 --> 00:37:45.470
Beautiful instrument.

00:37:45.470 --> 00:37:48.290
I remember reading that
when it was introduced

00:37:48.290 --> 00:37:52.820
into New York around 1954,
just when color television was

00:37:52.820 --> 00:37:56.390
starting to be available,
one of the freelance artists

00:37:56.390 --> 00:38:00.270
said, hey, this will be
a honey for color TV.

00:38:00.270 --> 00:38:05.010
And it was also made very famous
through Charlie Parker, who

00:38:05.010 --> 00:38:07.770
played the Grafton in this
very famous Massey Hall

00:38:07.770 --> 00:38:10.430
concert in Toronto, Canada.

00:38:10.430 --> 00:38:12.180
He agreed to play it,
no doubt, because he

00:38:12.180 --> 00:38:13.804
had pawned his other
saxophones and had

00:38:13.804 --> 00:38:15.550
nothing to play at that time.

00:38:15.550 --> 00:38:19.170
And he agreed to play
the Grafton in Canada.

00:38:19.170 --> 00:38:22.320
It has a beautiful sound,
but never caught on.

00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:23.942
Because it looked too different.

00:38:23.942 --> 00:38:25.650
The springing system
was quite innovative

00:38:25.650 --> 00:38:29.100
and actually very efficient,
but too different for players

00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:31.240
to really get comfortable with.

00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:38.270
And unfortunately, when it
got damaged, it didn't dent,

00:38:38.270 --> 00:38:40.589
it shattered.

00:38:40.589 --> 00:38:42.630
It wasn't the kind of
plastic that we know today.

00:38:42.630 --> 00:38:44.520
This is early plastic.

00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:48.000
And even though the company had
offered a lifetime guarantee--

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:49.620
if it shatters,
we replace it-- it

00:38:49.620 --> 00:38:54.150
wasn't enough for people to
become fully confident with it.

00:38:54.150 --> 00:38:56.070
And so it did not
last very long.

00:38:56.070 --> 00:38:57.780
It lasted perhaps
four or five years,

00:38:57.780 --> 00:39:01.560
and then faded into
saxophone obscurity.

00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:06.180
So this is the famous and
very storied plastic alto.

00:39:09.050 --> 00:39:13.080
One unusual saxophone that's
making a comeback these days

00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:17.210
is the very large
contrabass saxophone.

00:39:17.210 --> 00:39:19.805
And here's a stunning
photo in all ways.

00:39:24.158 --> 00:39:26.790
The contrabass saxophone is
an octave below the baritone--

00:39:26.790 --> 00:39:27.998
yes, question?

00:39:27.998 --> 00:39:30.674
AUDIENCE: How do you hold that?

00:39:30.674 --> 00:39:33.090
PAUL COHEN: With a really great
harness and great stature.

00:39:33.090 --> 00:39:34.800
You have to do calisthenics.

00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:37.676
It also comes with a stand,
but he's doing it freestyle.

00:39:37.676 --> 00:39:39.300
But just so you know,
the weight is not

00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:40.260
supported just by the neck.

00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:42.926
It's supported by the whole body
because of the harness with it.

00:39:42.926 --> 00:39:46.410
And you really can't
move quickly with it.

00:39:46.410 --> 00:39:48.934
And if you tried, you would
need a spotter to go with it.

00:39:51.900 --> 00:39:55.170
The contrabass is an
octave below the baritone.

00:39:55.170 --> 00:39:57.510
It was part of Sax's
original design,

00:39:57.510 --> 00:40:02.040
but they were made in limited
quantity up to the 1920s.

00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:07.020
But lately, a brilliant
saxophone inventor and designer

00:40:07.020 --> 00:40:10.650
in Germany, Eppelsheim, started
making a contemporary one.

00:40:10.650 --> 00:40:13.040
And this is one of those.

00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:15.270
We're going to hear what
a contrabass sax sounds

00:40:15.270 --> 00:40:20.130
like in an original work
written for contrabass saxophone

00:40:20.130 --> 00:40:23.940
and soprano saxophone, the
"Hymn and Fuguing Tune No.

00:40:23.940 --> 00:40:27.540
18" by Henry Cowell, who
lived a great deal of his life

00:40:27.540 --> 00:40:30.810
in California.

00:40:30.810 --> 00:40:33.990
This is a work written in
1964 for Sigurd Rascher,

00:40:33.990 --> 00:40:37.699
and I'm sure I won't
get it to work.

00:40:37.699 --> 00:40:40.240
I'm going to show you a picture
of two of my students playing

00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:42.490
it in Queens.

00:40:42.490 --> 00:40:44.910
And there'll be chances to
hear-- not them playing it,

00:40:44.910 --> 00:40:46.451
the recording you'll
hear will be one

00:40:46.451 --> 00:40:47.730
of my recordings of the piece.

00:40:47.730 --> 00:40:49.890
I'm playing that
soprano saxophone

00:40:49.890 --> 00:40:52.230
that you heard before,
and one of my colleagues

00:40:52.230 --> 00:40:53.659
is playing the contrabass.

00:40:56.653 --> 00:40:58.648
[MUSIC - "HYMN AND
FUGUING TUNE NO.

00:40:58.648 --> 00:40:59.148
18"]

00:40:59.148 --> 00:41:00.645
Can I get a job here now?

00:44:42.060 --> 00:44:45.436
And that is the
contrabass saxophone.

00:44:45.436 --> 00:44:47.310
This concludes the formal
part of my lecture,

00:44:47.310 --> 00:44:49.976
but I thought I'd leave a little
time if there are any questions

00:44:49.976 --> 00:44:51.680
that I can answer for you.

00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:53.356
Yes?

00:44:53.356 --> 00:44:55.330
AUDIENCE: Those
saxophones that they

00:44:55.330 --> 00:44:58.641
used in the very late 1800s,
what were the mouthpieces made

00:44:58.641 --> 00:44:59.260
out of?

00:44:59.260 --> 00:45:02.872
Did they use plastic
in those days, or--

00:45:02.872 --> 00:45:04.830
PAUL COHEN: Most of the
mouthpieces of the time

00:45:04.830 --> 00:45:06.672
are made of wood.

00:45:06.672 --> 00:45:08.630
And then in the early
part of the 20th century,

00:45:08.630 --> 00:45:10.796
they were made out of
bakelite or a kind of plastic.

00:45:10.796 --> 00:45:12.400
Some of them were
made out of aluminum

00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:13.358
around the early teens.

00:45:13.358 --> 00:45:15.070
But mostly were made of wood.

00:45:15.070 --> 00:45:18.280
Sometimes the wood
was covered with metal

00:45:18.280 --> 00:45:20.440
so that they wouldn't
warp so much.

00:45:20.440 --> 00:45:22.120
And the plastic that
we used didn't come

00:45:22.120 --> 00:45:27.720
into being until the 1930s.

00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:28.890
Yes?

00:45:28.890 --> 00:45:31.190
AUDIENCE: With the piece
that was just played,

00:45:31.190 --> 00:45:34.320
it seems that when
the contrabass goes up

00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:37.306
in the high range, it
seems significantly softer.

00:45:37.306 --> 00:45:39.930
PAUL COHEN: That was a function
of the micing for the recording

00:45:39.930 --> 00:45:41.700
session.

00:45:41.700 --> 00:45:44.010
And if you were to
hear it done in live,

00:45:44.010 --> 00:45:46.680
you would not hear
that disparity.

00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:49.290
Were there other questions?

00:45:49.290 --> 00:45:51.654
Yes?

00:45:51.654 --> 00:45:53.320
AUDIENCE: I'm curious
on the Conn-o-Sax,

00:45:53.320 --> 00:45:56.520
is the timbral difference mainly
from the spherical attachment

00:45:56.520 --> 00:45:58.390
on the bell, or are
there other differences?

00:45:58.390 --> 00:45:59.740
PAUL COHEN: No, there are
many other differences.

00:45:59.740 --> 00:46:01.240
The spherical
attachment of the bell

00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:04.775
is just one component of
ameliorating or masking

00:46:04.775 --> 00:46:06.540
the sound.

00:46:06.540 --> 00:46:11.740
In part, the bell has
three open resonance holes,

00:46:11.740 --> 00:46:14.080
one at either end and
one towards the player,

00:46:14.080 --> 00:46:15.650
not towards the listener.

00:46:15.650 --> 00:46:18.910
So that way it deliberately
doesn't allow some of the lower

00:46:18.910 --> 00:46:20.260
resonance to go forward.

00:46:20.260 --> 00:46:21.722
That helps it darken the sound.

00:46:21.722 --> 00:46:23.930
But you also have the inherent
bore of the instrument

00:46:23.930 --> 00:46:26.620
itself, and most
importantly, the mouthpiece

00:46:26.620 --> 00:46:30.340
that goes with it, which is
designed to have that darker,

00:46:30.340 --> 00:46:30.970
richer sound.

00:46:30.970 --> 00:46:33.130
So those three things
together helped

00:46:33.130 --> 00:46:35.350
to create the uniqueness
of the timbre.

00:46:35.350 --> 00:46:36.630
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:46:36.630 --> 00:46:39.130
PAUL COHEN: Yes?

00:46:39.130 --> 00:46:40.990
AUDIENCE: For a
time I've wondered,

00:46:40.990 --> 00:46:43.360
what would happen if you
were to mostly just cut off

00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:44.560
the bell of a saxophone?

00:46:44.560 --> 00:46:46.900
Would it make mainly
just the same sound?

00:46:46.900 --> 00:46:48.760
PAUL COHEN: It would
make the same sound.

00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:52.420
It would really toy
with the intonation,

00:46:52.420 --> 00:46:55.650
and you'd have to be careful
that you don't cut yourself.

00:46:55.650 --> 00:46:58.850
But the sound would be the same.

00:46:58.850 --> 00:47:00.460
There would be other
mechanical issues

00:47:00.460 --> 00:47:02.043
that would get a
little bit screwed up

00:47:02.043 --> 00:47:03.110
because of the linkages.

00:47:03.110 --> 00:47:04.510
But the sound would be the same.

00:47:04.510 --> 00:47:06.916
It'd just not go as low.

00:47:06.916 --> 00:47:09.090
Yes?

00:47:09.090 --> 00:47:10.590
AUDIENCE: You talk
about innovations

00:47:10.590 --> 00:47:13.470
through the '50s
was the last one.

00:47:13.470 --> 00:47:16.800
What has happened since then?

00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:18.410
More changes in sax?

00:47:18.410 --> 00:47:21.270
Or do you feel that
it's become more static,

00:47:21.270 --> 00:47:24.180
and there's less
experimentation going on?

00:47:24.180 --> 00:47:27.420
PAUL COHEN: There have been no
fewer innovations in saxophones

00:47:27.420 --> 00:47:31.820
since then, but they've been
more in manufacturing, and more

00:47:31.820 --> 00:47:34.860
in consistency, and how the
instrument's put together,

00:47:34.860 --> 00:47:37.980
and a more sophisticated
design of the instrument

00:47:37.980 --> 00:47:42.880
to improve the ergonomics,
to improve the intonation.

00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:46.980
We now have soprano saxophones
with detachable necks,

00:47:46.980 --> 00:47:49.420
which is an innovation
that wasn't available.

00:47:49.420 --> 00:47:51.480
And the detachable necks,
the different shapes

00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:53.160
of the necks give
different timbres

00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:55.950
and different comfort levels
of playing, is one example.

00:47:55.950 --> 00:47:58.560
So it's become
unfortunately prohibitively

00:47:58.560 --> 00:48:02.310
expensive to be as
innovative today

00:48:02.310 --> 00:48:05.280
as it was back in these times.

00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:06.780
Although today we
still have someone

00:48:06.780 --> 00:48:11.415
who has made a saxophone with
a chromatic fingering system,

00:48:11.415 --> 00:48:14.800
a unique, remarkably
acoustically well

00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:17.040
derived way of
play the saxophone.

00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:19.800
You have to relearn how
to play the instrument.

00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:24.935
Much like Billy True's three
saxophones with one player,

00:48:24.935 --> 00:48:26.810
this has an innovation
that is extraordinary,

00:48:26.810 --> 00:48:28.630
but is unfortunately
impractical.

00:48:32.190 --> 00:48:33.990
With today's modern
technique, we

00:48:33.990 --> 00:48:36.300
have developed one
handed saxophones

00:48:36.300 --> 00:48:38.550
that have been useful
for players who have lost

00:48:38.550 --> 00:48:40.140
the use of one of their hands.

00:48:40.140 --> 00:48:42.530
I have some one handed
saxophones from the 1920s,

00:48:42.530 --> 00:48:45.752
but they're not nearly
as innovative or as

00:48:45.752 --> 00:48:48.210
technically advanced as the
ones that are being made today.

00:48:48.210 --> 00:48:51.240
Some of them combine
micro electronics

00:48:51.240 --> 00:48:53.670
to help with the
fingering systems.

00:48:53.670 --> 00:48:55.620
So there are those
kinds of innovations,

00:48:55.620 --> 00:48:57.750
but they're not as
bold or as striking

00:48:57.750 --> 00:49:00.600
because it's too
expensive to try that

00:49:00.600 --> 00:49:02.940
without a certain market for it.

00:49:02.940 --> 00:49:03.510
Yes?

00:49:03.510 --> 00:49:05.190
AUDIENCE: There's been
a lot of innovation

00:49:05.190 --> 00:49:06.390
in a lot of
instruments these days,

00:49:06.390 --> 00:49:07.580
but it's not just
in the manufacturing

00:49:07.580 --> 00:49:08.330
of the instrument.

00:49:08.330 --> 00:49:10.830
It's been with cybernetic
editions and enhancements,

00:49:10.830 --> 00:49:12.570
like the [? Max ?] Violin.

00:49:12.570 --> 00:49:14.187
I know that in the
wind area, people

00:49:14.187 --> 00:49:16.020
are tracking the movement
of the instrument.

00:49:16.020 --> 00:49:21.210
They're applying sensors to
the keypads for extra effects.

00:49:21.210 --> 00:49:24.060
Can you speak to that and
what's going on with saxophones?

00:49:24.060 --> 00:49:27.090
PAUL COHEN: Well, we have a
lot of electronic enhancements

00:49:27.090 --> 00:49:28.485
that go with the saxophones.

00:49:31.310 --> 00:49:33.490
Like the MIDI controllers
that are saxophones.

00:49:33.490 --> 00:49:36.530
And there's saxophones
in fingering only,

00:49:36.530 --> 00:49:39.090
they don't bear any native
acoustical relationship to it.

00:49:39.090 --> 00:49:40.410
But yet we play them
like saxophones,

00:49:40.410 --> 00:49:42.780
and we can synthesize sounds,
and do all kinds of things

00:49:42.780 --> 00:49:43.280
with it.

00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:46.200
And that's used in a lot
of contemporary music.

00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:47.910
There are a lot of
other enhancements

00:49:47.910 --> 00:49:49.650
that we are experimenting
with the instruments

00:49:49.650 --> 00:49:51.691
by putting on different
weights, different masses

00:49:51.691 --> 00:49:54.460
to try to change the residence
patterns from the outside.

00:49:54.460 --> 00:49:56.217
There's a lot of
contention as to what

00:49:56.217 --> 00:49:58.050
the materials of the
instrument are made of,

00:49:58.050 --> 00:50:00.570
and what coating it has, and
how that affects the resonance

00:50:00.570 --> 00:50:03.130
patterns, and how that
may go into manufacturing.

00:50:03.130 --> 00:50:06.660
So there are these kind of
things that are going on.

00:50:06.660 --> 00:50:09.480
And there's no lack of any
acoustical studies as to what's

00:50:09.480 --> 00:50:11.870
happening with the instrument
that can be changed, either

00:50:11.870 --> 00:50:14.580
to enhance the traditional
view of the saxophone,

00:50:14.580 --> 00:50:17.040
or to propel it into a
more contemporary usage.

00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:18.831
So those are some examples.

00:50:18.831 --> 00:50:19.331
Yes?

00:50:24.580 --> 00:50:27.490
AUDIENCE: I was just wondering,
do some modern players prefer

00:50:27.490 --> 00:50:29.290
to play on these
older saxophones

00:50:29.290 --> 00:50:31.390
from 60, or 70, or 80
years ago, or is there

00:50:31.390 --> 00:50:34.730
a general preference that
new instruments are better?

00:50:34.730 --> 00:50:36.160
PAUL COHEN: I'm still living.

00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:41.230
[LAUGHTER] I guess you'd
call me a modern player.

00:50:41.230 --> 00:50:43.240
And I play a lot on
these instruments.

00:50:43.240 --> 00:50:47.069
The soprano that you saw me play
is one of two main performance

00:50:47.069 --> 00:50:48.610
sopranos that I use,
and you heard it

00:50:48.610 --> 00:50:52.840
in the recording of the
piece we just heard.

00:50:52.840 --> 00:50:54.640
A lot of it has
to do with what we

00:50:54.640 --> 00:50:56.980
listen for in the tone quality.

00:50:56.980 --> 00:51:00.280
There are many
modern players today

00:51:00.280 --> 00:51:02.234
who prefer this tone
quality, and will

00:51:02.234 --> 00:51:04.150
play the vintage
instruments, even though they

00:51:04.150 --> 00:51:06.160
have significant disadvantages.

00:51:06.160 --> 00:51:07.750
The ergonomics are not as easy.

00:51:07.750 --> 00:51:10.560
The intonation is not as easy.

00:51:10.560 --> 00:51:12.310
And they go out of
regulation quite a bit.

00:51:12.310 --> 00:51:15.070
But yet we put up with them,
because the newer instruments

00:51:15.070 --> 00:51:16.627
just don't have that same sound.

00:51:16.627 --> 00:51:18.460
So you see a very
interesting cross-section,

00:51:18.460 --> 00:51:20.770
a significant but
minor percentage

00:51:20.770 --> 00:51:23.090
of people who gravitate
towards this kind of sound

00:51:23.090 --> 00:51:25.390
for the music they play
will play these instruments.

00:51:25.390 --> 00:51:26.556
And they're still available.

00:51:26.556 --> 00:51:29.920
And when properly, if
not severely regulated,

00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:31.720
they can be as
professionally functional

00:51:31.720 --> 00:51:33.910
as any other instrument.

00:51:33.910 --> 00:51:36.270
Yes?

00:51:36.270 --> 00:51:38.020
AUDIENCE: I feel like
sometimes life would

00:51:38.020 --> 00:51:40.190
be easier if there was a C sax.

00:51:40.190 --> 00:51:43.540
And there is a C saxophone,
but we don't see it ever.

00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:49.180
Do you think that the
C saxophone could ever

00:51:49.180 --> 00:51:50.770
make a comeback?

00:51:50.770 --> 00:51:54.260
PAUL COHEN: Well, C saxophones
were not uncommon in the 1920s.

00:51:54.260 --> 00:51:56.740
In fact, the C Tenor, which
you call the C Melody,

00:51:56.740 --> 00:52:03.600
was the most sold
saxophone of the era.

00:52:03.600 --> 00:52:05.740
And along with that
is the C soprano.

00:52:05.740 --> 00:52:07.870
The main sopranos
in the key of C. I

00:52:07.870 --> 00:52:11.080
have many of them
in my collection.

00:52:11.080 --> 00:52:13.100
It might make things easier.

00:52:13.100 --> 00:52:17.450
But then again, we can simply
learn to transpose up a step

00:52:17.450 --> 00:52:19.670
as I do often.

00:52:19.670 --> 00:52:24.120
The issue with a C soprano is
that it's a little smaller,

00:52:24.120 --> 00:52:28.390
and they just don't play or
tune as well as the B flat ones.

00:52:28.390 --> 00:52:30.424
The C tenor was made
as a home instrument.

00:52:30.424 --> 00:52:31.840
And in a lot of
the advertisements

00:52:31.840 --> 00:52:33.340
that you would see
in the 1920s, you

00:52:33.340 --> 00:52:36.370
would see the family
at the dinner,

00:52:36.370 --> 00:52:39.400
gathered around the piano for
the evening's entertainment.

00:52:39.400 --> 00:52:41.740
Remember, this was before
anything was streaming.

00:52:41.740 --> 00:52:44.110
And in fact, was before
radio was that current,

00:52:44.110 --> 00:52:45.640
and there was no TV.

00:52:45.640 --> 00:52:47.225
So what we would
do after dinner,

00:52:47.225 --> 00:52:48.850
besides gone down to
a local apothecary

00:52:48.850 --> 00:52:51.120
and having a malted
or a phosphate,

00:52:51.120 --> 00:52:52.390
would be to gather on a piano.

00:52:52.390 --> 00:52:56.200
And you see this picture of
the father playing piano,

00:52:56.200 --> 00:52:57.950
and one of the family
members looking over

00:52:57.950 --> 00:53:02.260
a shoulder with a C tenor like
this, playing off the piano

00:53:02.260 --> 00:53:05.260
part in C, because that
was able to do that.

00:53:05.260 --> 00:53:11.230
So not too long ago, a company
came out with a C tenor.

00:53:11.230 --> 00:53:13.380
Antigua, I think was
the name, or Antilla.

00:53:13.380 --> 00:53:17.140
And unfortunately it didn't sell
very well, because two reasons.

00:53:17.140 --> 00:53:18.790
There wasn't that
much of an interest,

00:53:18.790 --> 00:53:23.590
and it seems that every C melody
that was made the 1920s still

00:53:23.590 --> 00:53:24.670
exists.

00:53:24.670 --> 00:53:27.660
And they come back to haunt
us, because they're everywhere.

00:53:27.660 --> 00:53:31.000
And then we have no use for
them, and only some of them

00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:32.471
are really, really well made.

00:53:32.471 --> 00:53:33.970
So I don't think
there's going to be

00:53:33.970 --> 00:53:37.540
much of a future for the C. But
I could probably interest you

00:53:37.540 --> 00:53:41.630
in a transposing coursebook.

00:53:41.630 --> 00:53:43.800
Yes?

00:53:43.800 --> 00:53:47.130
AUDIENCE: OK, one more.

00:53:47.130 --> 00:53:50.130
AUDIENCE: What would they do
with reeds in the early days

00:53:50.130 --> 00:53:51.982
of saxophones?

00:53:51.982 --> 00:53:53.190
PAUL COHEN: What we do today.

00:53:53.190 --> 00:53:54.530
We curse at them.

00:53:54.530 --> 00:53:56.040
We berate them.

00:53:56.040 --> 00:53:57.330
We mash them.

00:53:57.330 --> 00:53:59.040
We maneuver them.

00:53:59.040 --> 00:54:00.030
We kick them.

00:54:00.030 --> 00:54:01.000
We play them.

00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:02.082
We discard them.

00:54:02.082 --> 00:54:03.540
AUDIENCE: How would
they make them?

00:54:03.540 --> 00:54:05.520
Did they mass produce
them, or did you

00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:08.174
have to make them by
hand in the early days?

00:54:08.174 --> 00:54:10.590
PAUL COHEN: They were mass
produced in ways not dissimilar

00:54:10.590 --> 00:54:13.800
to today, except today we have
more sophisticated machinery.

00:54:13.800 --> 00:54:16.600
But yes, they had
to be hand cut,

00:54:16.600 --> 00:54:18.480
but they did have
machines that would

00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:22.980
do a lot of the bulk of the
maneuvering, lathes and things

00:54:22.980 --> 00:54:24.330
of that sort to do that.

00:54:24.330 --> 00:54:29.790
But today, the ability to make
many more reeds at even closer

00:54:29.790 --> 00:54:31.900
tolerances is very active.

00:54:31.900 --> 00:54:34.140
But then we have to look
at the quality of the cane.

00:54:34.140 --> 00:54:36.179
If they harvest it too
soon, if it grows well,

00:54:36.179 --> 00:54:38.220
if they don't cure it well
enough so that when it

00:54:38.220 --> 00:54:39.880
comes to us it's ready to play.

00:54:39.880 --> 00:54:41.713
So there are a lot of
factors going into it.

00:54:41.713 --> 00:54:46.410
But in a sense, the procedure
from cane stalk to reed

00:54:46.410 --> 00:54:50.184
is not dissimilar
today that it was then.

00:54:50.184 --> 00:54:52.530
Yes?

00:54:52.530 --> 00:54:53.607
I'm sorry, I just--

00:54:53.607 --> 00:54:57.244
AUDIENCE: What do you
think of plastic reeds?

00:54:57.244 --> 00:54:58.910
PAUL COHEN: We're at
Google here, right?

00:54:58.910 --> 00:55:00.620
So I can get technical.

00:55:00.620 --> 00:55:02.000
I don't like plastic reeds.

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:04.990
However, the
synthetic resin reeds

00:55:04.990 --> 00:55:06.720
that are being made today--

00:55:06.720 --> 00:55:10.310
which are not plastic, per se,
but it's not organic material--

00:55:10.310 --> 00:55:11.960
have great promise.

00:55:11.960 --> 00:55:15.134
I actually use them
from time to time.

00:55:15.134 --> 00:55:17.300
They have several advantages,
several disadvantages.

00:55:17.300 --> 00:55:21.050
But in the most current
manifestations of those things,

00:55:21.050 --> 00:55:23.467
mostly promoted by the Legere
company, they actually work,

00:55:23.467 --> 00:55:25.299
and I know a lot of
colleagues who use them,

00:55:25.299 --> 00:55:27.620
and they sound pretty good
on them./ so they've entered

00:55:27.620 --> 00:55:31.010
the stable of what can work.

00:55:31.010 --> 00:55:32.060
Yes?

00:55:32.060 --> 00:55:35.660
AUDIENCE: Are composers
composing today

00:55:35.660 --> 00:55:37.642
for orchestral music
with saxophone?

00:55:37.642 --> 00:55:38.600
PAUL COHEN: Constantly.

00:55:38.600 --> 00:55:40.954
It has become much
more accepted voice

00:55:40.954 --> 00:55:42.620
in a lot of orchestral
works these days.

00:55:42.620 --> 00:55:45.770
And so you'll hear it more,
and more, and more, and more.

00:55:45.770 --> 00:55:48.140
Yes?

00:55:48.140 --> 00:55:51.200
AUDIENCE: So we see many
innovations that didn't stick.

00:55:51.200 --> 00:55:54.470
Are there any major
innovations that did stick?

00:55:54.470 --> 00:55:56.240
PAUL COHEN: Well yes, in fact.

00:55:56.240 --> 00:55:57.840
Here's an example of one.

00:55:57.840 --> 00:55:59.670
This is a modern
curved sopranino

00:55:59.670 --> 00:56:01.802
that was made for me
by the Rampone company.

00:56:01.802 --> 00:56:04.010
And the ability to be able
to make an instrument that

00:56:04.010 --> 00:56:07.430
is professionally functional
requires quite a bit

00:56:07.430 --> 00:56:11.480
of not just artistry, but the
technique of manufacturing.

00:56:11.480 --> 00:56:15.230
As I mentioned earlier, we
have the two neck soprano

00:56:15.230 --> 00:56:17.720
saxophones, which is
an innovation that

00:56:17.720 --> 00:56:21.620
has only in less than 20 or
30 years become standard.

00:56:21.620 --> 00:56:24.840
We have the innovation of
the new contrabass saxophone

00:56:24.840 --> 00:56:27.320
that we saw.

00:56:27.320 --> 00:56:29.049
And other manufacturing
techniques

00:56:29.049 --> 00:56:31.340
that make the instruments
more consistent and just more

00:56:31.340 --> 00:56:31.839
viable.

00:56:34.200 --> 00:56:37.770
We have the soprillo
saxophone, which

00:56:37.770 --> 00:56:41.010
is an even smaller version of
the sopranino that is something

00:56:41.010 --> 00:56:43.500
that could not have been made
because there was no ability

00:56:43.500 --> 00:56:44.290
to make that.

00:56:44.290 --> 00:56:45.165
It's amazing, though.

00:56:45.165 --> 00:56:49.084
That's about this big, and
is in the key of B flat.

00:56:49.084 --> 00:56:51.000
AUDIENCE: Have there
been more recent attempts

00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:54.810
at making plastic saxophones?

00:56:54.810 --> 00:56:57.030
PAUL COHEN: Yes.

00:56:57.030 --> 00:56:59.370
In Asia there's a
company that has

00:56:59.370 --> 00:57:03.030
been making a new kind
of plastic saxophone.

00:57:03.030 --> 00:57:07.200
And it's been targeted
through the student group,

00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:08.490
and it's very new.

00:57:08.490 --> 00:57:10.110
Made in the last two years.

00:57:10.110 --> 00:57:12.836
And some people are
encouraged by it.

00:57:12.836 --> 00:57:15.210
There's no reason why you
can't make a plastic saxophone.

00:57:15.210 --> 00:57:19.010
Because the tone quality
of the instrument

00:57:19.010 --> 00:57:22.020
is solely a function of
the bore dimensions and not

00:57:22.020 --> 00:57:23.570
of the materials.

00:57:23.570 --> 00:57:25.910
So you should be able to
get a plastic saxophone

00:57:25.910 --> 00:57:31.010
that if it's internally made
according to the design,

00:57:31.010 --> 00:57:32.630
should sound just fine.

00:57:32.630 --> 00:57:35.750
Years ago they once
made a blindfold test

00:57:35.750 --> 00:57:40.490
of a very famous clarinetist
playing behind a screen.

00:57:40.490 --> 00:57:42.919
He played on his
R13 Buffet clarinet,

00:57:42.919 --> 00:57:44.210
and he played on a garden hose.

00:57:46.720 --> 00:57:48.616
And people couldn't
hear the difference.

00:57:48.616 --> 00:57:50.724
AUDIENCE: What about
the mouthpiece?

00:57:50.724 --> 00:57:51.890
PAUL COHEN: Same mouthpiece.

00:57:51.890 --> 00:57:54.740
Give us a break.

00:57:54.740 --> 00:57:56.010
It was the same mouthpiece.

00:57:56.010 --> 00:57:58.176
And of course, the garden
hose had some holes in it,

00:57:58.176 --> 00:58:00.410
which were carefully put in.

00:58:00.410 --> 00:58:03.230
The clarinet is a
cylindrical bore,

00:58:03.230 --> 00:58:07.860
the garden hose is a cylindrical
bore, no kinks in this hose.

00:58:07.860 --> 00:58:10.155
And because you had a very
fine player playing it,

00:58:10.155 --> 00:58:11.780
he was able to play
it the same, people

00:58:11.780 --> 00:58:13.320
could not tell the difference.

00:58:13.320 --> 00:58:15.232
So that's a very upsetting
story that people

00:58:15.232 --> 00:58:16.440
don't like to tell very much.

00:58:16.440 --> 00:58:18.640
But that's simply
an acoustic reality.

00:58:18.640 --> 00:58:20.390
So technically, you
should be able to make

00:58:20.390 --> 00:58:21.223
a plastic saxophone.

00:58:21.223 --> 00:58:24.190
Now, there are other issues
about why a plastic saxophone

00:58:24.190 --> 00:58:24.800
may not work.

00:58:24.800 --> 00:58:26.425
If you're going to
have all the joints,

00:58:26.425 --> 00:58:28.300
mechanical things
made of plastic,

00:58:28.300 --> 00:58:30.290
that may wear out
more than if you

00:58:30.290 --> 00:58:32.630
have traditional metal and
traditional bearings on that.

00:58:32.630 --> 00:58:34.220
But that's another issue.

00:58:34.220 --> 00:58:34.720
Yes?

00:58:34.720 --> 00:58:37.053
AUDIENCE: So I don't know if
this applies to saxophones,

00:58:37.053 --> 00:58:38.880
too, but I've tried a
metal clarinet before

00:58:38.880 --> 00:58:41.615
and that sounds totally
different from the wood

00:58:41.615 --> 00:58:42.925
or plastic ones.

00:58:42.925 --> 00:58:45.305
So do you think if he had
put like a metal clarinet,

00:58:45.305 --> 00:58:46.640
would it sound the same?

00:58:46.640 --> 00:58:50.090
Because I feel like
that would've not.

00:58:50.090 --> 00:58:53.210
PAUL COHEN: I'm sorry to say
that the metal clarinet can

00:58:53.210 --> 00:58:55.310
sound like a regular clarinet.

00:58:55.310 --> 00:58:57.050
Now, the metal
clarinets were designed

00:58:57.050 --> 00:58:59.097
to be used as
marching instruments,

00:58:59.097 --> 00:59:00.680
and to be used as
student instruments.

00:59:00.680 --> 00:59:03.350
They weren't made with the
same care as traditional ones.

00:59:03.350 --> 00:59:05.450
But if you were to
get a metal clarinet--

00:59:05.450 --> 00:59:07.040
and I've seen some
metal clarinets,

00:59:07.040 --> 00:59:08.456
and I've had some
of my colleagues

00:59:08.456 --> 00:59:10.220
play with their
professional mouthpieces

00:59:10.220 --> 00:59:12.940
and their professional
tonal imagery on it,

00:59:12.940 --> 00:59:14.570
they sound pretty good.

00:59:14.570 --> 00:59:19.580
So you know, if we close our
eyes, and numb our fingers,

00:59:19.580 --> 00:59:21.360
and just play what's
in front of us,

00:59:21.360 --> 00:59:25.400
you'd be amazed at how
similar those can be.

00:59:25.400 --> 00:59:27.890
Any other questions?

00:59:27.890 --> 00:59:29.700
I want to thank you
all for coming today.

00:59:29.700 --> 00:59:31.283
It's my pleasure to
be here at Google.

00:59:31.283 --> 00:59:33.980
And I hope you learned something
about the saxophone today.

00:59:33.980 --> 00:59:36.130
