AMIT CHOPRA: This
program enables

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.440
us to work with some of the
top development agencies

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:15.790
across the world.

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:19.080
These agencies are influencers
for some of the big clients.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.120
So as I and my team work
with them to upscale them,

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:26.020
they see a dramatic change in
the kind of quality of the apps

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:27.820
that are coming out
from these agencies.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.180
And it's exciting to really
see the ecosystem improve

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.790
because of the program
helping agencies

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:34.994
build better applications.

about this event is celebrating

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.900
that hard work and all of
our agencies that have become

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.620
certified over the past year.

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.550
RAVI KORUKONDA: I mean, we get
to meet a lot of other agencies

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.014

find new countries that are
introduced to the agency

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.485
program.

00:00:49.485 --> 00:00:51.050
We are able to
interact with them

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:52.999
and learn what cool
stuff they're doing.

00:00:52.999 --> 00:00:55.540
RODRIGO CARRARESI: I'm really
happy to see Brazilian agencies

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.480

program, engaging with us,

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.070
and receiving the award today.

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:01.810
Three of them were here.

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:03.820
And it was like a
dream come true.

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.278
ONYX MUELLER: Next
year, I'd really

00:01:05.278 --> 00:01:08.281
like to see how much the
agency program has grown

00:01:08.281 --> 00:01:10.030
and see how many other
partners that we'll

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.390
be able to discover and learn
with as we grow in that space,

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:14.020
as well.

Especially for new clients,
it's very important

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.310
that it have kind of a
statement that [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.410
