TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello,
I'm Timothy Jordan.

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:05.190
And you're watching
"The Developer Show."

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.440
This is a very special
episode, because it's

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.600
the 100th time we've
brought you an update

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.210
about the coolest
developer news from Google.

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.780
To celebrate, I've asked some
of our friends to help out.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.900
The Accelerated Mobile
Pages, or AMP story format,

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.150
provides you with a
mobile-focused format

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.520
for delivering news and
information as visually

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.290
rich tap-through stories.

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:27.540
To get started, head on
over to the post for links

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.685
to a tutorial and documentation.

00:00:29.685 --> 00:00:31.440
LAURENCE MORONEY:
AMP for email is also

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.590
now available for emails
to be formatted and sent

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.270
as AMP documents.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.990
As a part of this, we're kicking
off the Gmail developer preview

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:41.640
of AMP for email.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.170
So once you've
built your emails,

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.750
you'll be able to
test them using Gmail.

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.212
Take a look at the post for
code and a link to the spec.

00:00:49.212 --> 00:00:50.670
FLORINA MUNTENESCU:
Starting today,

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.690
the API for purchases.products
will return promo

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.960
as a new value for the
field purchase type

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.520
when the user
redeems a promo code.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.980
This improvement to the
Google Play Developer API

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.810
makes it easier to
track your promotions

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:05.459
from your own Beckett.

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:08.640
For more details and links to
the docs, check out the post.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.800
DAN GALPIN: Go 1.10
is now available.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.960
It includes automatic
caching of build and test

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.720
results as well as hundreds
of other smaller changes.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.850
Links to the release notes
and the download page

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.367
are on the post.

00:01:19.367 --> 00:01:21.450
JEN PERSON: You can now
integrate your server side

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.290
applications with the Firebase
Cloud Messaging v1 API

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.720
using the Firebase
Admin SDKs, which

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.230
allow you to send messages and
manage topic subscriptions.

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:34.830
Check out the post for some
code and links to the docs.

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.500
ROTO MEIER: Compute engine
machine talks with 96 vCPUs

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.870
and up to 624
gigabytes of memory

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:41.640
are now generally available.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.470
For applications that
can scale vertically,

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.110
you can leverage all
96 vCPUs to decrease

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.350
the number of VMs needed to run
your applications while still

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.420
reducing your total
cost of ownership.

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.420
Take a look at the
post for more details.

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.920
If you're wondering if you're
prepared for your Professional

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.680
Data Engineer
Certification exam,

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.690
well, Google Cloud Certified now
offers an online practice exam.

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.915
We designed it to help
you familiarize yourself

00:02:03.915 --> 00:02:05.790
with the type of questions
that will be asked

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.050
and check your readiness.

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.477
More details and a
link are on the post.

00:02:10.477 --> 00:02:13.060

And on behalf of all of us
on "The Developer Show" team,

We'll see you next week.

00:02:23.841 --> 00:02:27.680
From the vantage point of not
being able to see anything--
