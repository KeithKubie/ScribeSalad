00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:05.900
We're asked to simplify d times
4d to the 1/2 power.

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.000
So let's see what
we can do here.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.540
And I think there's multiple
ways to kind of simplify it,

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.260
and we'll explore all of them.

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.150
So d times 4d to the 1/2.

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.060
4d to the 1/2, let me just focus
on that right there.

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.490
4d to the 1/2.

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.360
If you take the product of two
things and you raise that to

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.110
an exponent, that's the same
thing as taking each of those

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:27.950
terms to that exponent and
then taking the product.

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:33.210
So 4d to the 1/2 is the same
thing as 4 to the 1/2 times d

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.260
to the 1/2.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.190
And of course, you have
this d out front.

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:40.670
And I could put the parentheses
here, but it

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:41.730
doesn't matter at this point.

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.250
Now you just have three
things that you're

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:44.590
taking the product of.

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.310
So I'll put this d out
front just like that.

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:49.230
And now there's a couple of ways
you could think about it.

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.130
You have this 4 to the 1/2 power
and you're taking its

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.650
principal square root, so its
positive square root.

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.030
So that right there
is going to be 2.

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.780
So 4 to the 1/2, that
right there is going

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.790
to be equal to 2.

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.180
And then, there's a couple of
ways you could think about it.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.740
You have this d out front.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:09.990
And then you have
a d to the 1/2.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.440
And there's several ways that
you can now represent this,

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.640
depending on what you feel--
I don't know--

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.120
aesthetically pleasant.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.110
You could say, well look, this
is d to the first power.

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:24.590
This is d to the 1/2 power.

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.580
I could add them.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.330
So one way to say it is it's 2
times d to the 1 plus 1/2.

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.630
You can either say 1 and
1/2 power or 3/2

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.110
power if you want.

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.810
So that's one simplification
of this expression.

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.470
Another simplification would be
well, you could say, look.

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:46.280
d to the 1/2, that is the same
thing as the square root of d.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.650
So you could say this is the
same thing as 2 times d times

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.670
the square root of d.

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.570
So any of these are actual
simplifications, but it's

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.030
interesting to see that
they're really all

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.800
representing the same thing.
