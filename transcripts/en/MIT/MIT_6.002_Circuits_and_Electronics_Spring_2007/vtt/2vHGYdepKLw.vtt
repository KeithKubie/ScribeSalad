00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.541
Good morning,
OK.

00:00:01.541 --> 00:00:05.779
Let's get started.
We have one handout today.

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:10.691
That's your lecture notes.
There's some copies still

00:00:10.691 --> 00:00:14.832
outside for those who haven't
picked one up.

00:00:14.832 --> 00:00:19.263
In general, what I do is,
in the lecture notes,

00:00:19.263 --> 00:00:22.827
I leave out large amounts of
material.

00:00:22.827 --> 00:00:28.317
So, this will enable you to
keep your hands busy while I'm

00:00:28.317 --> 00:00:34.000
lecturing and take down some
notes and so on.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.131
So, don't assume that
everything that I talk about is

00:00:41.131 --> 00:00:44.971
on here.
Please follow along.

00:00:44.971 --> 00:00:52.651
OK, so as is my usual practice,
let me start with a quick

00:00:52.651 --> 00:00:58.000
review of what we covered so
far.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.348
So what we did primarily was
looked at this discipline that

00:01:03.348 --> 00:01:07.867
we call the lump matter
discipline, which was very

00:01:07.867 --> 00:01:13.400
similar, very reminiscent of the
point mass simplification in

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.982
physics.
And this discipline,

00:01:15.982 --> 00:01:20.317
this set of constraints we
imposed on ourselves,

00:01:20.317 --> 00:01:25.204
allowed us to move from
Maxwell's equations to a very,

00:01:25.204 --> 00:01:30.000
very simple form of algebraic
equations.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.740
And specifically,
the discipline took two forms.

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:42.946
One is, we said that we will
deal with elements for whom the

00:01:42.946 --> 00:01:50.641
rate of change of magnetic flux
is zero outside of the elements,

00:01:50.641 --> 00:01:57.603
and for whom the rate of change
of charge I want to charge

00:01:57.603 --> 00:02:03.801
inside the element was zero.
So, if I took any element,

00:02:03.801 --> 00:02:07.128
any element that I called a
lump circuit element,

00:02:07.128 --> 00:02:11.079
like a resistor or a voltage
source, and I put a black box

00:02:11.079 --> 00:02:15.237
around it, then what I'm saying
is that the net charge inside

00:02:15.237 --> 00:02:18.564
that is going to be zero.
And this is not true in

00:02:18.564 --> 00:02:20.990
general.
We will see examples where,

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:24.455
if you choose some piece of an
element for example,

00:02:24.455 --> 00:02:27.851
there might be charge buildup,
but net inside the,

00:02:27.851 --> 00:02:30.623
if I put a box around the
entire element,

00:02:30.623 --> 00:02:34.504
I am going to assume that the
rate of change of charge is

00:02:34.504 --> 00:02:39.438
going to be zero.
So, what this did was it

00:02:39.438 --> 00:02:44.415
enabled us to create the lump
circuit abstraction,

00:02:44.415 --> 00:02:49.800
where I could take elements,
some element of the sort,

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.066
this could be a resistor,
a voltage source,

00:02:54.066 --> 00:02:57.825
or whatever,
and I could now ascribe a

00:02:57.825 --> 00:03:04.123
voltage, some voltage across an
element, and also some current,

00:03:04.123 --> 00:03:09.000
"i," that was going into the
element.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.830
And as I go forward,
when I label the voltages and

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.895
currents across and through
elements, I'm going to be

00:03:16.895 --> 00:03:21.039
following a convention.
OK, the convention is that I'm

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:24.478
going to label,
if I label V in the following

00:03:24.478 --> 00:03:28.856
manner, then I'm going to label
"i" for that element as a

00:03:28.856 --> 00:03:33.000
current flowing into the
positive terminal.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.016
It's just a convention.
By doing this,

00:03:36.016 --> 00:03:40.745
it turns out that the power
consumed by the element is "vi"

00:03:40.745 --> 00:03:44.088
is positive.
OK, so by choosing I going in

00:03:44.088 --> 00:03:48.736
this way into the positive
terminal, the power consumed by

00:03:48.736 --> 00:03:51.589
the element is going to be
positive.

00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:55.340
OK, so in general of even
simply following this

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.091
convention, when I label
voltages and currents,

00:03:59.091 --> 00:04:03.575
I'll be labeling the current
into an element entering in

00:04:03.575 --> 00:04:08.437
through the plus terminal.
Remember, of course,

00:04:08.437 --> 00:04:12.320
if the current is going this
way, let's have one amp of

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.771
current flowing this way,
then when I compute the

00:04:15.771 --> 00:04:18.718
current, "i" will come out to be
negative.

00:04:18.718 --> 00:04:22.529
OK, so by making these
assumptions, the assumptions of

00:04:22.529 --> 00:04:26.699
the lumped matter discipline,
I said I was able to simplify

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:31.837
my life tremendously.
And, in particular what it did

00:04:31.837 --> 00:04:36.094
was it allowed me to take
Maxwell's equations,

00:04:36.094 --> 00:04:41.297
OK, and simplify them into a
very simple algebraic form,

00:04:41.297 --> 00:04:46.689
which has both a voltage law
and a current law that I call

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:51.608
Kirchhoff's voltage law,
and Kirchhoff's current law.

00:04:51.608 --> 00:04:55.864
KVL simply states that if I
have some circuit,

00:04:55.864 --> 00:05:01.256
and if I measured the voltages
in any loop in the circuit,

00:05:01.256 --> 00:05:07.027
so if I look at the voltages in
any loop, then the voltages in

00:05:07.027 --> 00:05:13.388
the loop would sum to zero.
OK, so I measure voltages in

00:05:13.388 --> 00:05:16.374
the loop, and they will sum to
zero.

00:05:16.374 --> 00:05:21.236
Similarly, for the current,
if I take a node of a circuit,

00:05:21.236 --> 00:05:25.246
if I build the circuit,
a node is a point in the

00:05:25.246 --> 00:05:29.000
circuit where multiple edges
connect.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.865
If I take a node,
then the current coming into

00:05:32.865 --> 00:05:37.676
that node, the net current
coming into a node is going to

00:05:37.676 --> 00:05:40.768
be zero.
OK, so if I take any node of

00:05:40.768 --> 00:05:45.922
the circuit and sum up all the
currents going into that node,

00:05:45.922 --> 00:05:51.162
they will all net sum to zero.
So, notice what I've done is by

00:05:51.162 --> 00:05:55.200
this discipline,
by this constraint I imposed on

00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:00.440
myself, I was able to make this
incredible leap from Maxwell's

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:04.649
equations to these really,
really simple algebraic

00:06:04.649 --> 00:06:09.348
equations, KVL and KCL.
And I promise you,

00:06:09.348 --> 00:06:13.770
going forward to the rest of
6.002, if this is all you know,

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:18.042
you can pretty much solve any
circuit using these two very

00:06:18.042 --> 00:06:20.889
simple relations.
It's actually really,

00:06:20.889 --> 00:06:24.112
really simple.
It's all very simple algebra,

00:06:24.112 --> 00:06:26.060
OK?
So, just to show you an

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:29.133
example, let me do a little
demonstration.

00:06:29.133 --> 00:06:33.405
Let me build let me build a
small circuit and measure some

00:06:33.405 --> 00:06:37.002
voltages for you,
and show you that the voltages,

00:06:37.002 --> 00:06:42.000
indeed, add up to zero.
So, here's my little circuit.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.277
So, I'm going to show you a
simple circuit that looks like

00:07:29.277 --> 00:07:33.255
this, and let's go ahead and
measure some voltages and

00:07:33.255 --> 00:07:35.882
currents.
In terms of terminology to

00:07:35.882 --> 00:07:40.535
remember, this is called a loop.
So if I start from the point C

00:07:40.535 --> 00:07:45.263
and I travel through the voltage
source, come to the node A down

00:07:45.263 --> 00:07:49.166
through R1 and all the way down
through R2 back to C,

00:07:49.166 --> 00:07:52.318
that's a loop.
Similarly, this point A is a

00:07:52.318 --> 00:07:55.620
node where resistor R1 the
voltage source V0,

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:58.922
and R4 are connected.
OK, just make sure your

00:07:58.922 --> 00:08:04.713
terminology is correct.
So, what I'll do is I'll make

00:08:04.713 --> 00:08:10.608
some quick measurements for you,
and show you that these KVL and

00:08:10.608 --> 00:08:14.912
KCL are indeed true.
So, the circuits up there,

00:08:14.912 --> 00:08:18.561
could I have a volunteer?
Any volunteer?

00:08:18.561 --> 00:08:22.959
All you have to do is write
things on the board.

00:08:22.959 --> 00:08:26.327
Come on over.
OK, so let me take some

00:08:26.327 --> 00:08:30.163
measurements,
and why don't you write down

00:08:30.163 --> 00:08:35.589
what I measure on the board?
What I'll do is,

00:08:35.589 --> 00:08:39.662
let me borrow another piece of
chalk here.

00:08:39.662 --> 00:08:45.324
What I'll do is focus on this
loop here, and focus on this

00:08:45.324 --> 00:08:49.000
node and make some measurements.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.169
All right, so you see the
circuit up there.

00:09:05.169 --> 00:09:11.076
OK, so I get 3 volts for the
voltage from C to A.

00:09:11.076 --> 00:09:16.000
so why don't you write down 3
volts?

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:44.924
OK, so the next one is -1.6.
And so that will be,

00:09:44.924 --> 00:09:50.521
I'm doing AB,
V_AB.

00:09:50.521 --> 00:10:01.403
OK, and then let me do the last
one.

00:10:01.403 --> 00:10:08.705
It is -1.37.
The measurements,

00:10:08.705 --> 00:10:14.224
I guess, have been this way.
So, what's written is V_AC.

00:10:14.224 --> 00:10:18.339
But it's OK for now.
Don't worry about it.

00:10:18.339 --> 00:10:23.155
So, well, thank you.
I appreciate your help here.

00:10:23.155 --> 00:10:27.671
OK, so within the bonds of
experimental error,

00:10:27.671 --> 00:10:32.186
noticed that if I add up these
three voltages,

00:10:32.186 --> 00:10:38.679
they nicely sum up to zero.
OK, next let me focus on this

00:10:38.679 --> 00:10:41.174
node here.
And at this node,

00:10:41.174 --> 00:10:44.963
let me go ahead and measure
some currents.

00:10:44.963 --> 00:10:50.415
What I'll do now is change to
an AC voltage so that I can go

00:10:50.415 --> 00:10:55.683
ahead and measure the current
without breaking my circuit.

00:10:55.683 --> 00:10:59.564
OK, this time around,
you'll get to see the

00:10:59.564 --> 00:11:04.000
measurements that I'm taking as
well.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.904
So, what I have here,
I guess you can see it this

00:11:09.904 --> 00:11:14.210
way.
What I have here is three wires

00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:20.730
that I have pulled out from D.
And this is the node D,

00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:24.666
OK?
So, I have three wires coming

00:11:24.666 --> 00:11:32.047
into the node D just to make it
a little bit easier for me to

00:11:32.047 --> 00:11:37.662
measure stuff.
OK, so everybody keep your

00:11:37.662 --> 00:11:42.576
fingers crossed so I don't look
like a fool here.

00:11:42.576 --> 00:11:46.877
I hope this works out.
So, you roughly get,

00:11:46.877 --> 00:11:48.720
what's that,
10 mV.

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:53.430
OK, so it's about 10 mV peak to
peak out there,

00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:59.266
and let's say that if the
waveform raises on the left-hand

00:11:59.266 --> 00:12:05.000
side, it's positive.
So, it's positive 10 mV.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.942
And another positive 10 mV,
so that's 20 mV.

00:12:08.942 --> 00:12:11.693
And this time,
it's a negative,

00:12:11.693 --> 00:12:13.893
roughly 20, I guess,
-20.

00:12:13.893 --> 00:12:17.286
So, I'm getting,
in terms of currents,

00:12:17.286 --> 00:12:19.853
I have a -10,
-10, I'm sorry,

00:12:19.853 --> 00:12:22.054
positive 10,
positive 10,

00:12:22.054 --> 00:12:27.005
and a -20 that adds up to zero.
But more interestingly,

00:12:27.005 --> 00:12:31.773
I can show you the same thing
by holding this current

00:12:31.773 --> 00:12:37.000
measuring probe directly across
the node.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:43.360
And, notice that the net
current that is entering into

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:49.480
this node here is zero.
OK, so that should just show

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:56.919
you that KCL does indeed hold in
practice, and it is not just a

00:12:56.919 --> 00:13:02.493
figment of our imaginations.
So, before I go on,

00:13:02.493 --> 00:13:05.402
I wanted to point one other
thing out.

00:13:05.402 --> 00:13:09.961
Notice that I've written down
two assumptions of the lumped

00:13:09.961 --> 00:13:11.612
matter discipline,
OK?

00:13:11.612 --> 00:13:16.093
There is a total assumption of
the lump matter discipline,

00:13:16.093 --> 00:13:19.473
and that assumption is,
in spirit, at least,

00:13:19.473 --> 00:13:23.561
shared by the point mass
simplification in physics as

00:13:23.561 --> 00:13:26.234
well.
Can someone tell me what that

00:13:26.234 --> 00:13:28.828
assumption is?
A total assumption,

00:13:28.828 --> 00:13:32.758
which I did not mention,
which you can read in your

00:13:32.758 --> 00:13:36.767
notes in section 8.2 in the
appendix, what's a total

00:13:36.767 --> 00:13:41.012
assumption that is shared in
spirit with the point mass

00:13:41.012 --> 00:13:44.658
simplification?
Anybody?

00:13:44.658 --> 00:13:49.597
A total assumption to be made
here is that in all the signals

00:13:49.597 --> 00:13:53.548
that we will study in this
course, we've made the

00:13:53.548 --> 00:13:57.253
assumption that the signal
speeds of interest,

00:13:57.253 --> 00:14:01.286
transition speeds,
and so on, are much slower than

00:14:01.286 --> 00:14:05.237
the speed of light.
OK, that my signal transition

00:14:05.237 --> 00:14:11.000
speeds of interest are much
slower than the speed of light.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.655
Remember, the laws of motion,
the discrete laws of motion

00:14:14.655 --> 00:14:18.637
break down if your objects begin
moving at the speed of light.

00:14:18.637 --> 00:14:22.031
OK, the same token here,
our lump circuit abstraction

00:14:22.031 --> 00:14:24.968
breaks down if we approach the
speed of light.

00:14:24.968 --> 00:14:28.950
And there are follow on courses
that talk about waveguides and

00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:32.279
other distributed analysis
techniques that deal with

00:14:32.279 --> 00:14:36.000
signals that travel close to
speeds of light.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:41.551
OK, so with that,
let me go on to talking about

00:14:41.551 --> 00:14:48.672
method one of circuit analysis.
This is called the basic KVL

00:14:48.672 --> 00:14:53.137
KCL method.
So just based on those two

00:14:53.137 --> 00:15:00.017
simple algebraic relations,
I can analyze very interesting

00:15:00.017 --> 00:15:05.786
and complicated circuits.
The method goes as follows.

00:15:05.786 --> 00:15:09.226
So, let's say our goal is,
given a circuit like this,

00:15:09.226 --> 00:15:12.071
our goal is to solve it.
OK, in this course,

00:15:12.071 --> 00:15:15.643
we will do two kinds of things:
analysis and synthesis.

00:15:15.643 --> 00:15:17.628
Analysis says,
given a circuit,

00:15:17.628 --> 00:15:20.407
OK, what can you tell me about
the circuit?

00:15:20.407 --> 00:15:24.111
OK, so we'll solve existing
circuits for all the voltages

00:15:24.111 --> 00:15:26.625
and currents,
voltages across elements,

00:15:26.625 --> 00:15:30.000
and currents through those
elements.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.666
Synthesis says,
given a function,

00:15:32.666 --> 00:15:35.833
I may ask you to go and build
circuits.

00:15:35.833 --> 00:15:40.500
OK, so for analysis here,
we can apply this method that I

00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:44.083
want to show you.
And the idea here is that,

00:15:44.083 --> 00:15:48.333
given a circuit like this,
let us figure out all the

00:15:48.333 --> 00:15:53.083
voltages and currents that are a
function of the way these

00:15:53.083 --> 00:15:57.083
elements are connected.
So, the basic KVL and KCL

00:15:57.083 --> 00:16:02.250
method has the following steps.
The first step is to write down

00:16:02.250 --> 00:16:08.282
the element VI relationships.
OK, right down the element VI

00:16:08.282 --> 00:16:10.959
relationships for all the
elements.

00:16:10.959 --> 00:16:14.580
The second step is write KCL
for all the nodes,

00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:19.145
and the third step is to write
KVL for all the loops in the

00:16:19.145 --> 00:16:20.562
circuit.
That's it.

00:16:20.562 --> 00:16:23.868
Just go ahead and write down
element rules,

00:16:23.868 --> 00:16:27.332
KVL, and KCL,
and then go ahead and solve the

00:16:27.332 --> 00:16:29.379
circuit.
So, what we'll do,

00:16:29.379 --> 00:16:33.000
we'll do an example,
of course.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:39.104
But, just as a refresher,
we've looked at a bunch of

00:16:39.104 --> 00:16:43.532
elements so far,
and for the resistor,

00:16:43.532 --> 00:16:50.115
the element relation says that
V is pi R, where R is the

00:16:50.115 --> 00:16:56.339
resistance of the element here.
For a voltage source,

00:16:56.339 --> 00:17:01.247
V is equal to V nought.
That's the element

00:17:01.247 --> 00:17:06.742
relationship.
And for a current source,

00:17:06.742 --> 00:17:12.886
the element is the relation is,
"i" is simply the current

00:17:12.886 --> 00:17:19.029
flowing through the element.
OK, so these are some of the

00:17:19.029 --> 00:17:25.611
simple element rules for the
devices that the current source,

00:17:25.611 --> 00:17:30.000
voltage source,
and the resistor.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.884
So let's go ahead and solve
this simple circuit.

00:17:34.884 --> 00:17:40.912
And what I'll do is go ahead
and solve the circuit for you.

00:17:40.912 --> 00:17:46.941
OK, if you turn to page five of
your notes, I'm going to go

00:17:46.941 --> 00:17:53.384
ahead and edit the circuit here.
You can scribble the values on

00:17:53.384 --> 00:17:58.789
your notes on page five.
OK, so as a first step of my

00:17:58.789 --> 00:18:03.154
KVL KCL method,
I need to write down all my

00:18:03.154 --> 00:18:08.642
element VI relationships.
So, before I do that,

00:18:08.642 --> 00:18:13.255
let me go ahead and label all
the voltages and currents that

00:18:13.255 --> 00:18:17.713
are unknowns in the circuit.
So, let me label the voltages

00:18:17.713 --> 00:18:22.014
and currents associated with the
voltage source as here.

00:18:22.014 --> 00:18:26.706
Notice, I continue to follow
this convention where whenever I

00:18:26.706 --> 00:18:31.241
label voltages and currents for
an element, I will show the

00:18:31.241 --> 00:18:35.464
current going into the positive
terminal of the element

00:18:35.464 --> 00:18:40.000
variable, OK,
after element variable voltage.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.879
So here, I have V nought and I
nought.

00:18:42.879 --> 00:18:47.315
Let me pause here for five
seconds and show you a point of

00:18:47.315 --> 00:18:49.805
confusion that happens
sometimes.

00:18:49.805 --> 00:18:53.073
Often times,
people confuse between what is

00:18:53.073 --> 00:18:57.276
called the variable that is
associated with the element

00:18:57.276 --> 00:19:01.953
versus the element value.
OK, notice that here,

00:19:01.953 --> 00:19:07.069
capital V nought is the voltage
that this voltage source

00:19:07.069 --> 00:19:12.744
provides, while this name here,
v nought, is simply a variable

00:19:12.744 --> 00:19:17.953
that we've used to label the
voltage across that element.

00:19:17.953 --> 00:19:21.953
So, similarly,
I can label v1 as the voltage

00:19:21.953 --> 00:19:26.511
across the resistor,
and i1 is the current flowing

00:19:26.511 --> 00:19:30.976
through the resistor.
So this method of labeling,

00:19:30.976 --> 00:19:36.651
where I follow the convention,
that the current flows into the

00:19:36.651 --> 00:19:44.000
positive terminal is called the
associated variables discipline.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.000
I was trying to use the word
discipline in situations where

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.827
you have a choice,
OK, and of a variety of

00:19:50.827 --> 00:19:54.137
possible choices,
you pick one as the convention.

00:19:54.137 --> 00:19:56.068
OK, so here,
as a convention,

00:19:56.068 --> 00:20:00.344
we use the associated variables
discipline, and use that method

00:20:00.344 --> 00:20:04.275
to consistently label the
unknown voltages and currents in

00:20:04.275 --> 00:20:09.151
our circuits.
OK, so let me continue the

00:20:09.151 --> 00:20:13.272
labeling here,
v4, i4, i3, v3 here,

00:20:13.272 --> 00:20:16.303
and v2 and i2,
v5, and i5.

00:20:16.303 --> 00:20:22.242
I think that's it.
So, I've gone ahead and labeled

00:20:22.242 --> 00:20:27.696
all my unknowns.
So each of these voltages and

00:20:27.696 --> 00:20:35.090
currents are the voltages and
currents associated with each of

00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:40.675
the elements.
And my goal is to solve for

00:20:40.675 --> 00:20:44.342
these.
OK, so in terms of our solution

00:20:44.342 --> 00:20:49.594
here, let's follow the method
that I outlined for you.

00:20:49.594 --> 00:20:54.945
So, as the first step I am
simply going to go ahead and

00:20:54.945 --> 00:21:00.000
write down all the element VI
relationships.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:05.634
OK, so as a first step,
I'm going to go ahead and write

00:21:05.634 --> 00:21:12.000
down all the VI relationships.
So, can someone yell out for me

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.382
the VI relationship for the
voltage source?

00:21:16.382 --> 00:21:20.139
OK, good.
So, v0 is capital V nought,

00:21:20.139 --> 00:21:25.982
that is that the variable V
nought is simply equal to the

00:21:25.982 --> 00:21:29.947
voltage, v0.
Similarly, I can write the

00:21:29.947 --> 00:21:32.034
others.
v1 is i1, R1.

00:21:32.034 --> 00:21:36.000
v2 is i2, R2,
and so on.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.838
OK, and I have one,
two, three, four,

00:21:39.838 --> 00:21:44.316
five, six elements.
So, I will get six such

00:21:44.316 --> 00:21:48.687
equations.
Step two, I'm going to go ahead

00:21:48.687 --> 00:21:52.952
and write KCL for the nodes in
my system.

00:21:52.952 --> 00:21:57.643
So, let me start with node A.
So, for node A,

00:21:57.643 --> 00:22:05.000
let me take as positive the
currents going out of the node.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:10.641
So, I get i nought flowing out,
plus i1 flowing out,

00:22:10.641 --> 00:22:16.061
plus i4 flowing out,
and they must sum to zero for

00:22:16.061 --> 00:22:20.265
node A.
Then, I can go ahead and do the

00:22:20.265 --> 00:22:24.137
other nodes, let's say,
for example,

00:22:24.137 --> 00:22:28.451
I do node B.
For node B, I have i2 going

00:22:28.451 --> 00:22:31.589
out.
That's positive,

00:22:31.589 --> 00:22:36.456
i3, and i1 is coming in,
so I get -i1 equals zero.

00:22:36.456 --> 00:22:39.933
OK, so I have one,
two, three, four,

00:22:39.933 --> 00:22:44.006
I have four nodes.
OK, so I would get four

00:22:44.006 --> 00:22:47.781
equations.
It turns out that the fourth

00:22:47.781 --> 00:22:53.145
equation is not independent.
You can derive it from the

00:22:53.145 --> 00:22:56.523
others.
So, I get three independent

00:22:56.523 --> 00:23:01.821
equations out of this.
I can then write KVL.

00:23:01.821 --> 00:23:05.377
And for KVL,
I just go down my loops here.

00:23:05.377 --> 00:23:10.321
And let me go through this
first loop here in this manner.

00:23:10.321 --> 00:23:15.438
OK, and a simple trick that I
use, you have to be incredibly

00:23:15.438 --> 00:23:20.556
careful when you go through this
in keeping your minuses and

00:23:20.556 --> 00:23:23.678
pluses correct.
Otherwise you can get

00:23:23.678 --> 00:23:26.887
hopelessly muddled.
Once you label it,

00:23:26.887 --> 00:23:32.005
you need to be sure that you
get all your minuses and pluses

00:23:32.005 --> 00:23:34.904
correct.
So, for KVL,

00:23:34.904 --> 00:23:38.371
what I'd like to do is,
let's say I start at C,

00:23:38.371 --> 00:23:40.707
and from C I'm going to go to
A.

00:23:40.707 --> 00:23:44.023
For A I go to B,
and from B I'm going to come

00:23:44.023 --> 00:23:46.886
back to C.
OK, that's how I traverse my

00:23:46.886 --> 00:23:49.449
loop.
And, the trick that I'm going

00:23:49.449 --> 00:23:52.765
to follow is,
as my finger walks through that

00:23:52.765 --> 00:23:57.286
loop, I'm going to label the
voltage as the first sign that I

00:23:57.286 --> 00:24:02.093
see for that voltage.
OK, so I'm going to start with

00:24:02.093 --> 00:24:05.093
C, and I go up.
I start by punching into the

00:24:05.093 --> 00:24:08.302
voltage source element,
and then punch into it,

00:24:08.302 --> 00:24:10.883
I hit the minus sign for the V
nought.

00:24:10.883 --> 00:24:14.372
OK, so I'm just going to write
down minus V nought,

00:24:14.372 --> 00:24:18.627
plus then I go through and as I
come up to A and go down to B,

00:24:18.627 --> 00:24:21.000
I punch to the plus sign of the
V1.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.418
So, that's plus V1.
And then I punch into the plus

00:24:24.418 --> 00:24:26.930
sign of the V2,
and so I get plus V2,

00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:30.000
and that is zero.
OK, good.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.048
So, that matches what you have
in your notes as well.

00:24:33.048 --> 00:24:36.625
So, this is the first equation.
Similarly, I can go through my

00:24:36.625 --> 00:24:40.026
other loops and write down
equations for each of the loops.

00:24:40.026 --> 00:24:43.192
OK, and the convention that I
like to follow is as I go

00:24:43.192 --> 00:24:45.947
through the loop,
I write down as a sign for the

00:24:45.947 --> 00:24:49.114
voltage the first sign that I
counter for that element.

00:24:49.114 --> 00:24:51.811
OK, you can do the exact
opposite, if you want,

00:24:51.811 --> 00:24:54.449
just to be different.
But, as long as you stay

00:24:54.449 --> 00:24:57.381
consistent, you'll be OK.
All right, so in the same

00:24:57.381 --> 00:25:00.254
manner here, there are four
loops that I can have,

00:25:00.254 --> 00:25:03.127
so four equations.
Again, one of them turns out to

00:25:03.127 --> 00:25:08.490
be dependent on the others.
So I end up getting three

00:25:08.490 --> 00:25:12.974
independent equations.
So, I get a total of 12

00:25:12.974 --> 00:25:15.863
equations.
I get 12 equations.

00:25:15.863 --> 00:25:20.047
There are six elements,
OK, voltage source,

00:25:20.047 --> 00:25:24.431
and five resistors.
So, there are six unknown

00:25:24.431 --> 00:25:27.819
voltages, and six unknown
currents.

00:25:27.819 --> 00:25:33.000
So, I have 12 equations,
and 12 unknowns.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:38.700
OK, I can take all of the
equations and put them through a

00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:42.099
big crank, and sit there and
grind.

00:25:42.099 --> 00:25:47.400
And if I was really cruel,
I'd give this as a homework

00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:53.200
problem, and have you grind,
and grind, and grind until you

00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:57.000
get your six voltages and six
currents.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:01.099
OK, it works.
OK, so you get 12 equations,

00:26:01.099 --> 00:26:07.189
and this method just works.
However, notice that this is

00:26:07.189 --> 00:26:10.318
quite a grubby method.
It's quite grungy.

00:26:10.318 --> 00:26:14.150
I get 12 equations,
and it's quite a pain even for

00:26:14.150 --> 00:26:18.687
a simple circuit like this.
However, suffice it to say that

00:26:18.687 --> 00:26:22.910
this fundamental method is one
step away from Maxwell's

00:26:22.910 --> 00:26:25.022
equations, simply works.
OK?

00:26:25.022 --> 00:26:28.541
So what you'll do is the rest
of this lecture,

00:26:28.541 --> 00:26:33.000
I'll introduce you to a couple
more methods.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:40.281
One is an intuitive method,
and another one called the node

00:26:40.281 --> 00:26:46.809
method is a little bit more
formal, but is much more,

00:26:46.809 --> 00:26:51.580
I guess, terse Than the KVL KCL
method.

00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:56.601
Method 2.
So the relevant section to read

00:26:56.601 --> 00:27:02.000
in the course notes is section
2.4.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:06.000
One of the things that I will
be stressing this semester is

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.827
intuition.
What you'll find is that as you

00:27:08.827 --> 00:27:11.586
become EECS majors,
and so on, and go on,

00:27:11.586 --> 00:27:15.379
or if you talk to your TAs or
your professors and so on,

00:27:15.379 --> 00:27:19.448
you will find that very rarely
do they actually go ahead and

00:27:19.448 --> 00:27:21.931
apply the formal methods of
analysis.

00:27:21.931 --> 00:27:25.241
OK, by and large,
engineers are able to look at a

00:27:25.241 --> 00:27:28.413
circuit and simply by
observation write down an

00:27:28.413 --> 00:27:31.469
answer.
And usually in the past,

00:27:31.469 --> 00:27:35.020
what we have tried to do is
kind of ignore that process and

00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:37.714
told our students,
look, we teach you all the

00:27:37.714 --> 00:27:40.408
formal methods,
and you will develop your own

00:27:40.408 --> 00:27:44.142
intuition and be able to do it.
What we'll try to do this term

00:27:44.142 --> 00:27:47.938
is try to stress the intuitive
methods, and try to show you how

00:27:47.938 --> 00:27:51.367
the intuitive process goes,
so you can very quickly solve

00:27:51.367 --> 00:27:54.000
many of these circuits simply by
inspection.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.428
OK, so this method that I'm
going to show you here is one

00:27:57.428 --> 00:28:02.763
such an intuitive method.
And I'll call it element

00:28:02.763 --> 00:28:08.174
combination tools.
OK, for many simple circuits,

00:28:08.174 --> 00:28:14.506
you can solve them very quickly
by applying this method.

00:28:14.506 --> 00:28:18.996
The components of this method
are these.

00:28:18.996 --> 00:28:24.753
I learned about how to compose
a bunch of elements.

00:28:24.753 --> 00:28:27.746
So, let's say,
for example,

00:28:27.746 --> 00:28:32.351
I have a set of resistors,
R1 through RN,

00:28:32.351 --> 00:28:38.085
in series.
OK, you can use KVL and KCL to

00:28:38.085 --> 00:28:44.563
show that this is equivalent to
a single resistor whose value is

00:28:44.563 --> 00:28:48.163
given by the sum of the
resistances.

00:28:48.163 --> 00:28:54.127
OK, so if I have resistors in
series, then effectively it's

00:28:54.127 --> 00:28:59.886
the same as if there was a
single resistor whose value is

00:28:59.886 --> 00:29:07.180
the sum of all the resistances.
OK, you can look at the course

00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:11.950
notes for a proof for derivation
of this fact.

00:29:11.950 --> 00:29:16.614
Similarly, if I have
resistances in parallel,

00:29:16.614 --> 00:29:20.007
so let me call them
conductances.

00:29:20.007 --> 00:29:24.989
A conductance is the reciprocal
of a resistance.

00:29:24.989 --> 00:29:31.349
If resistance is measured in
ohms, conductance is measured in

00:29:31.349 --> 00:29:36.722
mhos, M-H-O-S.
OK, so that's the conductance

00:29:36.722 --> 00:29:39.914
is G1, G2, and G3.
And effectively,

00:29:39.914 --> 00:29:44.795
this is the same as having a
single conductance whose

00:29:44.795 --> 00:29:49.959
effective value is given by the
sum of the conductances.

00:29:49.959 --> 00:29:53.338
OK, the conductances in
parallel add,

00:29:53.338 --> 00:30:00.118
and resistances in series add.
Similarly, for voltage sources,

00:30:00.118 --> 00:30:06.155
if I have voltage sources in
series, then they are tantamount

00:30:06.155 --> 00:30:10.280
to the sum of the voltages.
And similarly,

00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:14.707
for currents,
if I have currents in parallel,

00:30:14.707 --> 00:30:19.737
then they can be viewed as a
single current source,

00:30:19.737 --> 00:30:24.969
whose currents are the sum of
the individual parallel

00:30:24.969 --> 00:30:30.000
currents.
So, let's do a quick example.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:36.616
So let's do this example.
So, let's say I have a circuit

00:30:36.616 --> 00:30:41.789
that looks like this,
and three resistances.

00:30:41.789 --> 00:30:47.203
And let's say all I care about
is the current,

00:30:47.203 --> 00:30:50.932
I, that flows through this
wire.

00:30:50.932 --> 00:30:54.781
All I care about is that
current.

00:30:54.781 --> 00:31:02.000
Of course, you can go ahead and
write KVL and KCL.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:06.123
You will get four equations,
and there are four unknowns.

00:31:06.123 --> 00:31:09.657
And you can solve it.
But, I can apply my element

00:31:09.657 --> 00:31:12.971
combination rules,
and very quickly figure out

00:31:12.971 --> 00:31:16.800
what the current I is,
using the following technique.

00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:19.819
So, what I can do is,
I can, first of all,

00:31:19.819 --> 00:31:23.206
take this circuit.
And, I can compose these two

00:31:23.206 --> 00:31:27.624
resistances and show that the
circuit is equivalent as far as

00:31:27.624 --> 00:31:30.201
this current,
I, is concerned to the

00:31:30.201 --> 00:31:33.000
following circuit,
R1.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:39.259
And I take the sum of the two
conductances,

00:31:39.259 --> 00:31:46.860
OK, and that comes out to be
R1, R2, R3, R2 plus R3.

00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:54.908
And then, I can further
simplify it, and I get a single

00:31:54.908 --> 00:32:01.764
resistance, whose value is given
by R1 plus R2,

00:32:01.764 --> 00:32:06.326
R3, R3.
OK, I'm just simplifying the

00:32:06.326 --> 00:32:08.903
circuit.
Now, from this circuit,

00:32:08.903 --> 00:32:11.562
I can get the answer that I
need.

00:32:11.562 --> 00:32:15.385
I is simply the voltage,
V, divided by R1 plus.

00:32:15.385 --> 00:32:20.371
OK, so in situations like this
where I'm looking for a single

00:32:20.371 --> 00:32:25.440
current, I can very quickly get
to the answer by applying some

00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:28.265
of these element combination
rules.

00:32:28.265 --> 00:32:34.000
And, I can get rid of having to
go through formal steps.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.900
So, in general,
whenever you encounter a

00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:41.512
circuit, by and large attempt to
use intuitive methods to solve

00:32:41.512 --> 00:32:43.966
it.
And go to a formal method only

00:32:43.966 --> 00:32:47.909
if some intuitive method fails.
Even in your homework,

00:32:47.909 --> 00:32:51.107
by and large,
the homeworks are not meant to

00:32:51.107 --> 00:32:54.157
be grungy.
OK, if you find a lot of grunge

00:32:54.157 --> 00:32:57.578
in your homework,
just remember you're probably

00:32:57.578 --> 00:33:04.284
not using some intuitive method.
OK, so just be cautious.

00:33:04.284 --> 00:33:11.947
All right, so let me go on to
the third method of circuit

00:33:11.947 --> 00:33:19.610
analysis, and the third method
is called the node method.

00:33:19.610 --> 00:33:28.094
So, the node method is simply a
specific application of the KVL

00:33:28.094 --> 00:33:36.031
KCL method and results in a
much, much more compact form of

00:33:36.031 --> 00:33:42.093
the final equations.
If there's one method that you

00:33:42.093 --> 00:33:46.000
have to remember for life,
then I would say just remember

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.511
this method.
OK, the node method is a

00:33:48.511 --> 00:33:50.813
workhorse of the easiest
industry.

00:33:50.813 --> 00:33:55.069
OK, if there's one method that
you want to consistently apply,

00:33:55.069 --> 00:33:58.000
then this is the one to
remember.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:01.718
So, let me quickly outline for
you to method,

00:34:01.718 --> 00:34:04.760
and then work out an example
for you.

00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:09.154
The first step of the node
method will be to select a

00:34:09.154 --> 00:34:14.056
reference or a ground node.
This is the symbol for a ground

00:34:14.056 --> 00:34:16.760
node.
The ground node simply says

00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:21.154
that I'm going to denote
voltages at that point to be

00:34:21.154 --> 00:34:26.309
zero, and measure all my other
voltages with reference to that

00:34:26.309 --> 00:34:30.649
point.
So, I'm going to select a

00:34:30.649 --> 00:34:36.264
ground node in my circuit.
Second, I want to label the

00:34:36.264 --> 00:34:41.562
remaining voltages with respect
to the ground node.

00:34:41.562 --> 00:34:48.026
So, label voltages for all the
other nodes with respect to the

00:34:48.026 --> 00:34:52.582
ground node.
Next, write KCL for each of the

00:34:52.582 --> 00:34:57.562
nodes write KCL.
OK, but don't write KCL for the

00:34:57.562 --> 00:35:02.576
ground node.
Remember, if you have N nodes,

00:35:02.576 --> 00:35:07.558
the node equations will give
you N-1 independent equations.

00:35:07.558 --> 00:35:12.539
So, write KCL for the nodes,
but don't do so for the ground

00:35:12.539 --> 00:35:15.030
node.
Then, solve for the node

00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:18.122
voltages.
So, let's say when we label

00:35:18.122 --> 00:35:21.558
voltages.
I want to be labeling them as E

00:35:21.558 --> 00:35:26.110
something or the other.
So, solve for the unknown node

00:35:26.110 --> 00:35:31.090
voltages.
And then, once I know all the

00:35:31.090 --> 00:35:37.485
voltages associated with the
nodes, I can then back solve for

00:35:37.485 --> 00:35:41.322
all the branch voltages and
currents.

00:35:41.322 --> 00:35:47.398
OK, once I know all the node
voltages, I can then go ahead

00:35:47.398 --> 00:35:52.940
and figure out all the branch
voltages and the branch

00:35:52.940 --> 00:35:56.884
currents.
So, let's go ahead and apply

00:35:56.884 --> 00:36:02.000
this method, and work out an
example.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:05.411
Again, remember,
if there's one method that you

00:36:05.411 --> 00:36:08.155
should remember,
it's the node method.

00:36:08.155 --> 00:36:11.789
OK, and when in doubt,
consistently apply the node

00:36:11.789 --> 00:36:15.942
method and it will work whether
your circuit is linear or

00:36:15.942 --> 00:36:20.466
nonlinear, if the resistors are
built in the US or the USSR it

00:36:20.466 --> 00:36:23.877
doesn't matter.
OK, the node method will simply

00:36:23.877 --> 00:36:26.028
work, linear or nonlinear,
OK?

00:36:26.028 --> 00:36:30.626
So, what I'm going to do is I'm
going to build a circuit that's

00:36:30.626 --> 00:36:36.384
my old faithful.
It's our old faithful,

00:36:36.384 --> 00:36:45.461
plus I'll make it a little bit
more complicated by adding in

00:36:45.461 --> 00:36:52.538
the current source.
So, let's go have some fun.

00:36:52.538 --> 00:36:59.000
Let's do this.
So here's my voltage source,

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:04.846
as before.
OK, what I'll do is for fun,

00:37:04.846 --> 00:37:13.536
add a current source out there.
And, you can convince

00:37:13.536 --> 00:37:20.782
yourselves that if you go ahead
and apply the KVL KCL method,

00:37:20.782 --> 00:37:25.009
it'll really be a mess of
equations.

00:37:25.009 --> 00:37:28.028
OK, so R1, R3,
R4, R2, R5.

00:37:28.028 --> 00:37:36.000
OK, so let's follow our method
and just plug and chug here.

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:39.329
So let's apply the first step.
I select a ground node.

00:37:39.329 --> 00:37:42.910
It's a reference node from
which I'll measure all my other

00:37:42.910 --> 00:37:44.921
voltages.
OK, now without knowing

00:37:44.921 --> 00:37:48.502
anything about the node method,
try to use intuition as to

00:37:48.502 --> 00:37:51.329
which node you should choose as
a ground node.

00:37:51.329 --> 00:37:55.036
Remember, you want to label the
ground node with the voltage

00:37:55.036 --> 00:37:58.806
zero, and measure all the other
voltages with respect to that

00:37:58.806 --> 00:38:02.549
node.
OK, a usual trick is to pick a

00:38:02.549 --> 00:38:07.393
node which has the largest
number of elements connected to

00:38:07.393 --> 00:38:11.133
it as the ground node.
OK, and in particular,

00:38:11.133 --> 00:38:16.062
you will find out later it's
useful to pick a node in which

00:38:16.062 --> 00:38:20.396
all your voltage sources,
the maximum number of your

00:38:20.396 --> 00:38:23.286
voltage sources are also
connected.

00:38:23.286 --> 00:38:27.875
OK, so in this instance,
I'm going to choose this as my

00:38:27.875 --> 00:38:32.467
ground node.
OK, that's my first step.

00:38:32.467 --> 00:38:38.486
I chose that as my ground node.
And I'm going to label that as

00:38:38.486 --> 00:38:41.842
having a voltage zero.
Second step,

00:38:41.842 --> 00:38:47.368
I'll label voltages of the
other branches with respect to

00:38:47.368 --> 00:38:52.006
the ground node.
OK, so what I'll do is add this

00:38:52.006 --> 00:38:55.559
node here.
So I'm going to label that

00:38:55.559 --> 00:39:00.000
voltage E1.
These are my unknowns.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:05.948
Remember, node method,
because my node voltages are my

00:39:05.948 --> 00:39:09.540
unknowns.
So, I label this as E1.

00:39:09.540 --> 00:39:14.255
I label this one as my unknown
voltage, E2.

00:39:14.255 --> 00:39:19.755
What about this one here?
Is that voltage unknown?

00:39:19.755 --> 00:39:23.010
No.
I know what the voltage is

00:39:23.010 --> 00:39:28.061
because I know that this node is
at a voltage,

00:39:28.061 --> 00:39:33.000
V0, higher than the ground
node.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:38.485
OK, notice that to go from here
to here, I directly go through a

00:39:38.485 --> 00:39:42.316
voltage source.
And so, this node has voltage

00:39:42.316 --> 00:39:45.189
V0.
And I'll simply write down V0.

00:39:45.189 --> 00:39:50.240
OK, try to simplify the number
of steps that you have to go

00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:55.116
through, so directly go ahead
and write down the voltage,

00:39:55.116 --> 00:39:58.424
V0, for that node.
What I will also do,

00:39:58.424 --> 00:40:02.168
is for convenience,
I'm going to write down,

00:40:02.168 --> 00:40:08.445
I'm going to use conductances.
So I'm going to use GI in the

00:40:08.445 --> 00:40:12.578
place of one by RI,
and write down a bunch of node

00:40:12.578 --> 00:40:14.771
equations.
OK, so step one,

00:40:14.771 --> 00:40:19.578
I've chosen my ground node.
Step two, I've labeled my node

00:40:19.578 --> 00:40:23.373
voltages, E, OK?
I've done that with two of my

00:40:23.373 --> 00:40:27.000
steps.
Now, let me go ahead and --

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:44.928
OK, so let me go ahead and
apply step three.

00:40:44.928 --> 00:40:50.228
And, step three says go ahead
and apply KCL for each of the

00:40:50.228 --> 00:40:54.522
nodes at which you have an
unknown node voltage.

00:40:54.522 --> 00:40:59.000
And then that will give you
your equations.

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:02.291
So let me start by applying KCL
at E1.

00:41:02.291 --> 00:41:06.471
So, let me write KCL at E1.
I do one more thing.

00:41:06.471 --> 00:41:09.940
Notice, I don't have any
currents there.

00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:14.566
OK, so how do I write KCL?
KCL simply says the sum of

00:41:14.566 --> 00:41:18.479
currents into a node is zero
again, remember,

00:41:18.479 --> 00:41:23.905
by the lump matter discipline.
So, if I don't have currents in

00:41:23.905 --> 00:41:28.619
there, so the trick that I adopt
is that to write KCL,

00:41:28.619 --> 00:41:34.103
I use the node voltages,
and implicitly substitute for

00:41:34.103 --> 00:41:37.367
the node voltages,
divide by the elemental the

00:41:37.367 --> 00:41:41.212
resistance, for instance,
so I take the node voltages,

00:41:41.212 --> 00:41:44.476
and divide by the resistance,
get the current.

00:41:44.476 --> 00:41:48.611
OK, so I implicitly apply
element relationships to get the

00:41:48.611 --> 00:41:51.658
node currents.
So, the example that make it

00:41:51.658 --> 00:41:55.865
clear, so I take node E1 and,
again, for currents going out

00:41:55.865 --> 00:42:00.000
I'm going to assume to have,
to be positive.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:05.232
So, the current going up is E1
minus V nought,

00:42:05.232 --> 00:42:09.767
divide by R1,
so I multiplied by the G1.

00:42:09.767 --> 00:42:16.627
That's the current going up.
Plus, the current going down is

00:42:16.627 --> 00:42:22.790
E1 minus zero where the ground
node potential is zero,

00:42:22.790 --> 00:42:28.953
G2, OK, plus the current that
is going to resistor R3,

00:42:28.953 --> 00:42:35.000
which is simply E1 minus E2,
divide by R3.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:37.565
So, E1 minus E2,
divide by R3,

00:42:37.565 --> 00:42:40.750
or multiplied by G3 is equal to
zero.

00:42:40.750 --> 00:42:44.465
OK, see how I got this?
This is simply KCL,

00:42:44.465 --> 00:42:49.065
but to get my currents,
I simply take the differences

00:42:49.065 --> 00:42:54.019
of voltages across elements,
and divide by the element of

00:42:54.019 --> 00:42:58.000
resistance, and I get the
currents.

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:01.619
OK, so I can similarly write
KCL at E2.

00:43:01.619 --> 00:43:06.000
So, at KCL at E2,
again, let me go outwards.

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:14.948
So, the current going up is E2
minus V nought multiplied by G4.

00:43:14.948 --> 00:43:22.597
The current going left is E2
minus E1 divided by R3 or

00:43:22.597 --> 00:43:29.092
multiplied by G3.
The current going down is E2

00:43:29.092 --> 00:43:37.082
minus zero multiplied by G5.
And, the current going down is

00:43:37.082 --> 00:43:40.369
-I1.
OK, you've got to be careful

00:43:40.369 --> 00:43:46.020
with your polarities here.
So all the currents going out

00:43:46.020 --> 00:43:50.335
sum to zero.
And here are the currents that

00:43:50.335 --> 00:43:56.397
are going out at this point.
So what I do next is I can move

00:43:56.397 --> 00:44:01.945
the constant terms to the
left-hand side and collect my

00:44:01.945 --> 00:44:07.907
unknowns.
So, let me write them out here.

00:44:07.907 --> 00:44:14.840
So, let's say I get E1 here,
OK, and from this equation,

00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:20.260
I have a V nought,
G1, which comes out here.

00:44:20.260 --> 00:44:26.563
So, minus V nought G1 comes
over to the other side.

00:44:26.563 --> 00:44:34.000
And, let me collect all the
values that multiply E1.

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:39.848
So I get, G1 is one example.
I have G2, and I have G3.

00:44:39.848 --> 00:44:43.489
And then, for E2,
I have minus G3.

00:44:43.489 --> 00:44:49.448
OK, so I'll simply express this
as the element voltages

00:44:49.448 --> 00:44:55.186
multiplied by some terms in
parentheses, and I put my

00:44:55.186 --> 00:44:59.489
external sources on the right
hand side.

00:44:59.489 --> 00:45:06.000
Similarly, I go ahead and do
the same thing here.

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:10.037
In this instance,
let me move my sources to the

00:45:10.037 --> 00:45:13.197
right.
So, I get I1 coming out there,

00:45:13.197 --> 00:45:16.532
and I get V nought G4 coming
out there.

00:45:16.532 --> 00:45:21.360
By the way, I just want to
mention to you that if you're

00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:25.836
looking to fall asleep,
this is a good time to do so

00:45:25.836 --> 00:45:30.313
because as soon as I write down
these two equations,

00:45:30.313 --> 00:45:36.104
OK, from now on it's nap time.
There's nothing new that you're

00:45:36.104 --> 00:45:40.040
going to learn from here on.
It's just Anant Agarwal having

00:45:40.040 --> 00:45:43.095
fun at the blackboard,
pushing symbols around.

00:45:43.095 --> 00:45:46.352
So, once you write down these
two node equations,

00:45:46.352 --> 00:45:48.660
the rest of it is just grubby
math.

00:45:48.660 --> 00:45:52.733
So, let me just have some fun.
So let me just go ahead and do

00:45:52.733 --> 00:45:54.904
that.
So, I moved my voltages and

00:45:54.904 --> 00:45:58.502
currents to the other side.
And let me collect all the

00:45:58.502 --> 00:46:01.285
coefficients for E1 here.
So, E1 minus G3,

00:46:01.285 --> 00:46:04.000
and that's it,
I guess.

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:08.915
OK, and then I'll do the same
for E2.

00:46:08.915 --> 00:46:12.464
So, I get G4,
and I get G3,

00:46:12.464 --> 00:46:18.335
and I get G5.
OK, so notice here that I have

00:46:18.335 --> 00:46:22.568
two equations,
and two unknowns.

00:46:22.568 --> 00:46:29.121
OK, the two equations are on
the right hand side,

00:46:29.121 --> 00:46:35.811
I have some voltages and
currents which are my dry

00:46:35.811 --> 00:46:43.689
voltages and dry currents.
OK, so actually this is getting

00:46:43.689 --> 00:46:46.899
quite boring.
I'm going to pause here,

00:46:46.899 --> 00:46:52.018
and talk about something else.
So, you can take this and you

00:46:52.018 --> 00:46:56.703
can put it in matrix form,
so I've done that for you on

00:46:56.703 --> 00:47:00.000
page ten.
It's all matrix form.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:03.194
Yeah, I know that.
You can use any technique to

00:47:03.194 --> 00:47:07.013
solve it, use algebraic
techniques, use linear algebraic

00:47:07.013 --> 00:47:09.444
methods to solve it,
use a computer,

00:47:09.444 --> 00:47:11.736
whatever you want.
And, computers,

00:47:11.736 --> 00:47:15.416
when computers analyze
circuits, they write down these

00:47:15.416 --> 00:47:18.263
equations, and deal with solving
matrices.

00:47:18.263 --> 00:47:21.250
So, when you take the linear
algebra across,

00:47:21.250 --> 00:47:25.000
how many people here have taken
a linear algebra class?

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:30.000
How many people here have heard
of Gaussian elimination?

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:34.607
How can more people have heard
of Gaussian elimination than

00:47:34.607 --> 00:47:37.785
took a linear algebra class?
Well anyway,

00:47:37.785 --> 00:47:42.313
so now you know why you took
those linear algebra classes.

00:47:42.313 --> 00:47:47.000
And so, if I just collected
these into matrix form --

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:09.440
OK, so I just simply expressed
those two equations in linear

00:48:09.440 --> 00:48:12.064
algebraic form,
and here's my column vector of

00:48:12.064 --> 00:48:15.738
unknowns, and you can apply any
of the techniques you've learned

00:48:15.738 --> 00:48:17.779
in linear algebra to solve for
this.

00:48:17.779 --> 00:48:20.520
Gaussian elimination works.
OK, and in computer,

00:48:20.520 --> 00:48:23.086
people doing research in
computer techniques,

00:48:23.086 --> 00:48:26.410
or solving such equations
simply deals with huge equations

00:48:26.410 --> 00:48:28.859
like this, building computer
programs that,

00:48:28.859 --> 00:48:33.000
given equations like this,
can go ahead and solve them.

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:36.186
OK, so let me stop here and
reemphasize that what you've

00:48:36.186 --> 00:48:39.720
done is made a huge leap from
Maxwell's equations to using the

00:48:39.720 --> 00:48:43.255
lump matter discipline to KVL
and KCL, which ended up giving a

00:48:43.255 --> 00:48:46.615
simple algebraic equation to
solve, and not having to worry

00:48:46.615 --> 00:48:49.917
about partial differential
equations that were the form of

00:48:49.917 --> 00:48:51.250
Maxwell's equations.
