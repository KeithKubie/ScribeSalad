00:00:00.937 --> 00:00:05.124
- I have six equations here,
where there is an unknown.

00:00:05.124 --> 00:00:08.549
What I want you to do, is
pause the video right now

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:11.346
and try to figure out
what that unknown is.

00:00:11.346 --> 00:00:14.009
So, in this first one,
the unknown is a blank.

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.467
What is this blank? What
is this question mark?

00:00:16.467 --> 00:00:17.686
What is this smiley face?

00:00:17.686 --> 00:00:20.704
What does this letter A need
to be in terms of a number?

00:00:20.704 --> 00:00:22.543
What is B? What is this star?

00:00:22.543 --> 00:00:25.478
So, pause the video now.

00:00:25.478 --> 00:00:27.054
So, let's think through each of them.

00:00:27.054 --> 00:00:31.187
This says three times
something is equal to 12.

00:00:31.187 --> 00:00:32.592
So, let's think about
what we have to multiply

00:00:32.592 --> 00:00:35.053
by three to get to 12.

00:00:35.053 --> 00:00:39.255
So, three times one is three,
three times two is six.

00:00:39.255 --> 00:00:44.219
Three times three is nine,
three times four is 12.

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:47.126
Three times four is 12, so we could say

00:00:47.126 --> 00:00:50.499
that the blank needs to be equal to four.

00:00:50.499 --> 00:00:53.204
Three times four is 12.

00:00:53.204 --> 00:00:54.591
Now, let's work on this one.

00:00:54.591 --> 00:00:57.470
Something divided by, so question mark

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.789
divided by four is equal to six.

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:04.846
Well, this is the same thing as saying

00:01:04.846 --> 00:01:09.846
that question mark is
equal to four times six,

00:01:10.662 --> 00:01:13.204
or you could say six times
four, they're the same.

00:01:13.204 --> 00:01:15.305
It is equal to six times four,

00:01:15.305 --> 00:01:19.789
which is the same thing as four times six.

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:22.344
So, what is six times four?

00:01:22.344 --> 00:01:26.003
Well six times one is six,
six times two is twelve,

00:01:26.003 --> 00:01:31.003
six times three is eighteen,
six time four is 24.

00:01:31.477 --> 00:01:34.089
So, question mark, so this is equal to 24,

00:01:34.089 --> 00:01:37.769
so question mark must be equal to 24.

00:01:37.769 --> 00:01:39.266
Write that down, question mark,

00:01:39.266 --> 00:01:42.401
in this case, is equal to 24.

00:01:42.401 --> 00:01:47.265
Now, here I have 54 is equal
to nine times smiley face.

00:01:47.265 --> 00:01:49.928
So, nine times what is equal to 54?

00:01:49.928 --> 00:01:51.314
Well, let's just skip count with nine

00:01:51.314 --> 00:01:53.113
and try to figure that out.

00:01:53.113 --> 00:01:56.492
Nine times one is nine.
Nine times two is 18.

00:01:56.492 --> 00:01:59.816
Nine times three is 27,
notice I'm just adding nine

00:01:59.816 --> 00:02:03.551
each time, nine times four is 36.

00:02:03.551 --> 00:02:08.551
Nine times five is 45.
Nine times six is 54.

00:02:10.265 --> 00:02:13.384
This is 54 is nine times six.

00:02:13.384 --> 00:02:16.430
Nine times six is equal to 54.

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.238
So, we now know that the smiley face,

00:02:19.238 --> 00:02:23.623
so smiley face must be equal to six.

00:02:23.623 --> 00:02:25.610
If we replace the smiley face with a six,

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.262
then this equation is true.

00:02:27.262 --> 00:02:31.501
54 is equal to nine times six.

00:02:31.501 --> 00:02:33.243
Let's work on this one up here.

00:02:33.243 --> 00:02:38.194
Nine is equal to A divided by eight.

00:02:38.194 --> 00:02:41.461
Well, this is the same thing
as saying that if A divided by

00:02:41.461 --> 00:02:43.977
eight is equal to nine, well that means

00:02:43.977 --> 00:02:47.390
that nine times eight must be equal to A.

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.390
Nine times eight must be equal to A.

00:02:52.869 --> 00:02:56.327
If I divide A into eight
groups and I have nine

00:02:56.327 --> 00:02:59.962
in each group, that means
if I have nine in a group

00:02:59.962 --> 00:03:04.064
times eight groups, I must have
the total number of things.

00:03:04.064 --> 00:03:06.057
So, what is nine times eight?

00:03:06.057 --> 00:03:08.843
Well, nine times one is nine,
in fact we already did a lot

00:03:08.843 --> 00:03:10.546
of our nine times tables down here,

00:03:10.546 --> 00:03:12.120
we could just keep going.

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.900
Nine times six was 54,
nine times seven is 63.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.900
Nine times eight is 72,
so nine times eight,

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:25.755
nine times eight is equal to 72.

00:03:25.755 --> 00:03:30.755
So, we can say that A is equal to 72

00:03:30.793 --> 00:03:34.157
and if A is equal to 72,
then this equation becomes

00:03:34.157 --> 00:03:38.359
nine is equal to 72 divided by eight,

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:39.971
which is absolutely true.

00:03:39.971 --> 00:03:44.971
72 divided by eight is nine,
nine times eight is 72.

00:03:44.973 --> 00:03:48.995
B is equal to 20 divided by five.

00:03:48.995 --> 00:03:51.297
Well, what's 20 divided by 5?

00:03:51.297 --> 00:03:52.920
Well, there's a couple of
ways you could think about it.

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.091
You could literally view this
as the same thing as saying

00:03:55.091 --> 00:03:59.245
that five times B is equal to 20.

00:03:59.245 --> 00:04:01.996
So, five times what is equal to 20?

00:04:01.996 --> 00:04:05.317
Five times one is five,
five times two is 10.

00:04:05.317 --> 00:04:10.313
Five times three is fifteen,
five times four is 20.

00:04:10.543 --> 00:04:14.348
Five times four is equal
to 20, so that tells us

00:04:14.348 --> 00:04:18.225
that B, B must be equal to four.

00:04:18.225 --> 00:04:22.346
B is equal to four, so we could write four

00:04:22.346 --> 00:04:26.946
is equal to 20 divided by
five, which is absolutely true.

00:04:26.946 --> 00:04:28.939
If 20 divided by five is equal to four,

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:32.027
four is equal to 20 divided by five.

00:04:32.027 --> 00:04:33.789
Now, we have one last one.

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:38.789
We have star times two is
equal to four, is equal to 14.

00:04:39.497 --> 00:04:42.620
So, what times two is equal to 14?

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.279
Well, let's just look at
our two, alright, our two,

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:46.881
our multiples of two.

00:04:46.881 --> 00:04:51.181
So, let's see if two times
one is two, four, six, eight,

00:04:51.181 --> 00:04:55.461
10, 12, 14, so how did, how many times

00:04:55.461 --> 00:04:57.601
did we have to multiply two to get to 14?

00:04:57.601 --> 00:05:02.534
So, this is one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven.

00:05:02.534 --> 00:05:07.212
Two times seven is 14, so
if I wrote seven times two

00:05:07.212 --> 00:05:10.794
is equal to 14, this is absolutely true.

00:05:10.794 --> 00:05:14.219
So, star must be equal to seven.

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:17.301
Star is equal to seven.
