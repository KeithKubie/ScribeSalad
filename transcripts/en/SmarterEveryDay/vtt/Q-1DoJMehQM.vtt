Hey it's me Destin welcome back to Smarter Every Day. So I think I can make the argument

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:08.080
that any time you add animals to the equation it gets more interesting. Case in point.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:12.110
Would you agree with that Spotsy?

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:16.140
Get you cinched up here. So there. All I did was add an

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.180
animal and this video instantly got ten times better. Today on Smarter Every Day

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.260
we're gonna add animals to the equation. We're gonna do this, we're gonna study the most interesting

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:28.300
animals on the planet. We're going to the Amazon rainforest. You see, about

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.330
eight months ago somebody left this comment on this video.

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:36.340
Of course I said yes. Turns out it's an outfit called Rainforest Expeditions,

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.370
and they were asking me if I just wanted to come down to the Amazon rainforest and observe things.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.390
Gotta get you back out of here. So the people that make this high speed

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.430
camera heard that I was going and asked me if I wanted to test out their new model.

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.450
Now mark my word, this is a revolution in high speed

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:56.490
videography. This is called a Miro. What this does, is with this button

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.500
and this battery, now you can shoot high speed from your hand

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.510
in the middle of the rainforest. This guy behind me, Jeff, he asked me

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.540
to come down. He's the photographer. So this is Jeff Cremer.
- How you doing?

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.580
- Expert in high resolution photography. This is Phil Torres, with

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.620
Cornell University. He's an entomologist. This is Gordon McLattery, Vancouver Film School.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.660
He is an audio engineer. What do I call you?

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.670
- I'm a musician man!
(Deston) Jerson's pretty interesting because his family actually

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.690
used to own a lot of the land that Rainforest Expedition uses now for their eco lodges.

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.730
Anyway, I'm Destin. You're getting Smarter Every Day. Enjoy this short teaser video. I'm not gonna

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.770
show you a whole lot because there's a lot in the videos you're gonna like. Have a good one.

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.790
[music]

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.830
(Destin) [Spanish]

00:01:44.850 --> 00:03:05.430
                   

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.460
She actually fell asleep. So, if you've never subscribed to

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.490
Smarter Every Day, or your friends haven't, now is the time to tell them about it because I'm about to put stuff

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.530
on the internet that's never been on the internet. OK I'm gonna level with you right now.

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:21.570
I made this thing to be funny, but turns out, if I support the cat's weight with my

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.610
hand, she doesn't have to balance so she's totally relaxed

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.630
and she can sleep anywhere. Look at this. She can sleep above my head.

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.650
She has claws. She could be ripping my head off right now.

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.670
Let's see. Did I wake you up? Does this wake.. yeah? This wakes you up.

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.720
You come back on my head and you go back to sleep? Are you asleep?

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:45.750
Seriously? Yes you are. OK.

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:49.770
I will see you next week on the amazing Amazon series unless I am selling

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.810
cat slings on the internet and becoming a millionaire. Have a good one.

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.880
It's amazing.
