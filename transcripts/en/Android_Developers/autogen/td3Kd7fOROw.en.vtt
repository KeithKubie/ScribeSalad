00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:16.549
it in P sort of in baby steps but it's
important to talk about just briefly

00:10:16.549 --> 00:10:16.559
important to talk about just briefly
 

00:10:16.559 --> 00:10:18.199
important to talk about just briefly
like why is this even important why are

00:10:18.199 --> 00:10:18.209
like why is this even important why are
 

00:10:18.209 --> 00:10:21.919
like why is this even important why are
we going to gesture navigation overall

00:10:21.919 --> 00:10:21.929
we going to gesture navigation overall
 

00:10:21.929 --> 00:10:23.989
we going to gesture navigation overall
in the operating system the basic idea

00:10:23.989 --> 00:10:23.999
in the operating system the basic idea
 

00:10:23.999 --> 00:10:26.239
in the operating system the basic idea
is to just get less system UI in the way

00:10:26.239 --> 00:10:26.249
is to just get less system UI in the way
 

00:10:26.249 --> 00:10:29.090
is to just get less system UI in the way
of your beautiful content that's not

00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:29.100
of your beautiful content that's not
 

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:32.540
of your beautiful content that's not
really we do we do more beautiful what

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:32.550
really we do we do more beautiful what
 

00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:33.739
really we do we do more beautiful what
would be the most beautiful thing that

00:10:33.739 --> 00:10:33.749
would be the most beautiful thing that
 

00:10:33.749 --> 00:10:46.579
would be the most beautiful thing that
we could put here right right okay so in

00:10:46.579 --> 00:10:46.589
we could put here right right okay so in
 

00:10:46.589 --> 00:10:48.499
we could put here right right okay so in
the case of gesture navigation on at the

00:10:48.499 --> 00:10:48.509
the case of gesture navigation on at the
 

00:10:48.509 --> 00:10:51.319
the case of gesture navigation on at the
OS level we noticed the UI paradigm in

00:10:51.319 --> 00:10:51.329
OS level we noticed the UI paradigm in
 

00:10:51.329 --> 00:10:53.269
OS level we noticed the UI paradigm in
the wild and we took a look at it

00:10:53.269 --> 00:10:53.279
the wild and we took a look at it
 

00:10:53.279 --> 00:10:54.859
the wild and we took a look at it
understood it made it safer more

00:10:54.859 --> 00:10:54.869
understood it made it safer more
 

00:10:54.869 --> 00:10:56.960
understood it made it safer more
reusable and added it so the framework

00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:56.970
reusable and added it so the framework
 

00:10:56.970 --> 00:10:58.939
reusable and added it so the framework
does this sound familiar to you this is

00:10:58.939 --> 00:10:58.949
does this sound familiar to you this is
 

00:10:58.949 --> 00:11:01.730
does this sound familiar to you this is
what we do at Android and in this case

00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:01.740
what we do at Android and in this case
 

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:02.929
what we do at Android and in this case
it was actually devices that we're

00:11:02.929 --> 00:11:02.939
it was actually devices that we're
 

00:11:02.939 --> 00:11:05.239
it was actually devices that we're
pioneering more immersive experiences

00:11:05.239 --> 00:11:05.249
pioneering more immersive experiences
 

00:11:05.249 --> 00:11:07.160
pioneering more immersive experiences
but all with different gestures where

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:07.170
but all with different gestures where
 

00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:09.379
but all with different gestures where
you would slide and poke the screen in

00:11:09.379 --> 00:11:09.389
you would slide and poke the screen in
 

00:11:09.389 --> 00:11:10.730
you would slide and poke the screen in
order to get it to do different things

00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:10.740
order to get it to do different things
 

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:13.879
order to get it to do different things
so we actually worked with OEMs on this

00:11:13.879 --> 00:11:13.889
so we actually worked with OEMs on this
 

00:11:13.889 --> 00:11:17.949
so we actually worked with OEMs on this
and that's one careful's to do a gentle

00:11:17.949 --> 00:11:17.959
and that's one careful's to do a gentle
 

00:11:17.959 --> 00:11:20.739
and that's one careful's to do a gentle
gentle is the word of the day remember

00:11:20.739 --> 00:11:20.749
gentle is the word of the day remember

gentle is the word of the day remember
we actually worked with OEMs on this and

00:11:23.569 --> 00:11:23.579
we actually worked with OEMs on this and
 

00:11:23.579 --> 00:11:25.939
we actually worked with OEMs on this and
came up with a standard that is much

00:11:25.939 --> 00:11:25.949
came up with a standard that is much
 

00:11:25.949 --> 00:11:28.699
came up with a standard that is much
simpler and we can start to see across

00:11:28.699 --> 00:11:28.709
simpler and we can start to see across
 

00:11:28.709 --> 00:11:32.299
simpler and we can start to see across
the ecosystem so as app developers you

00:11:32.299 --> 00:11:32.309
the ecosystem so as app developers you
 

00:11:32.309 --> 00:11:34.220
the ecosystem so as app developers you
need to prepare yourselves one of the

00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:34.230
need to prepare yourselves one of the
 

00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:35.780
need to prepare yourselves one of the
things you want to do is simply draw

00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:35.790
things you want to do is simply draw
 

00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:37.129
things you want to do is simply draw
edge to edge I mean the whole point of

00:11:37.129 --> 00:11:37.139
edge to edge I mean the whole point of
 

00:11:37.139 --> 00:11:39.590
edge to edge I mean the whole point of
this is to give you more more chet face

00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:39.600
this is to give you more more chet face
 

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:42.769
this is to give you more more chet face
so go ahead and actually draw underneath

00:11:42.769 --> 00:11:42.779
so go ahead and actually draw underneath
 

00:11:42.779 --> 00:11:44.269
so go ahead and actually draw underneath
the status bar underneath the navigation

00:11:44.269 --> 00:11:44.279
the status bar underneath the navigation
 

00:11:44.279 --> 00:11:46.429
the status bar underneath the navigation
bar where you might not ordinarily have

bar where you might not ordinarily have
 

00:11:46.439 --> 00:11:47.960
bar where you might not ordinarily have
done but you want to avoid putting

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:47.970
done but you want to avoid putting
 

00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:49.369
done but you want to avoid putting
clickable things there because those

00:11:49.369 --> 00:11:49.379
clickable things there because those
 

00:11:49.379 --> 00:11:51.439
clickable things there because those
clicks are potentially gonna get

00:11:51.439 --> 00:11:51.449
clicks are potentially gonna get
 

00:11:51.449 --> 00:11:53.030
clicks are potentially gonna get
captured by for example this status bar

00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:53.040
captured by for example this status bar
 

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:55.039
captured by for example this status bar
you also want to figure out where the

00:11:55.039 --> 00:11:55.049
you also want to figure out where the
 

00:11:55.049 --> 00:11:56.239
you also want to figure out where the
gesture areas are and we're

00:11:56.239 --> 00:11:56.249
gesture areas are and we're
 

00:11:56.249 --> 00:11:57.889
gesture areas are and we're
standardizing what these gestures are

00:11:57.889 --> 00:11:57.899
standardizing what these gestures are
 

00:11:57.899 --> 00:11:59.449
standardizing what these gestures are
but you'll actually want to look at the

00:11:59.449 --> 00:11:59.459
but you'll actually want to look at the
 

00:11:59.459 --> 00:12:01.549
but you'll actually want to look at the
insects to figure out where there are

00:12:01.549 --> 00:12:01.559
insects to figure out where there are
 

00:12:01.559 --> 00:12:03.439
insects to figure out where there are
regions where a swipe from the edge is

00:12:03.439 --> 00:12:03.449
regions where a swipe from the edge is
 

00:12:03.449 --> 00:12:04.489
regions where a swipe from the edge is
actually going to be taken over by the

00:12:04.489 --> 00:12:04.499
actually going to be taken over by the
 

00:12:04.499 --> 00:12:05.330
actually going to be taken over by the
operating system

00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:05.340

obviously we've had that for a long time

00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:06.630
obviously we've had that for a long time
 

00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:08.090
obviously we've had that for a long time
from the top of the screen and the

00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:08.100
from the top of the screen and the
 

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:09.410
from the top of the screen and the
bottom and now it's happening from the

00:12:09.410 --> 00:12:09.420
bottom and now it's happening from the
 

00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:10.940
bottom and now it's happening from the
left and right so you don't want to put

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:10.950
left and right so you don't want to put
 

00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:12.230
left and right so you don't want to put
draggable things there but of course

00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:12.240
draggable things there but of course
 

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:15.470
draggable things there but of course
clicks will still work touches taps if

00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:15.480
clicks will still work touches taps if
 

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:17.269
clicks will still work touches taps if

you really really really need to be able
to drag in from the side so you've got a

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:21.150
to drag in from the side so you've got a
 

00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:22.880
to drag in from the side so you've got a
game or you've got a side bar navigation

hear those are popular you can actually

00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:27.360
hear those are popular you can actually
 

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:29.510
hear those are popular you can actually
use things called exclusion rectangles

00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:29.520
use things called exclusion rectangles

that door you could take away just you

00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:41.220
that door you could take away just you

that door you could take away just you
know one of those system gesture areas

00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:43.950
know one of those system gesture areas

and bring it to your app but remember if

00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:45.390
and bring it to your app but remember if
 

00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:46.970
and bring it to your app but remember if
the user is going to be relying on this

to go back that it needs to really
 

00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:51.650
to go back that it needs to really
really make sense that it's not gonna do

00:12:51.650 --> 00:12:51.660
really make sense that it's not gonna do
 

00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:55.010
really make sense that it's not gonna do
that in your app and we are talking

00:12:55.010 --> 00:12:55.020
that in your app and we are talking
 

00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:57.230
that in your app and we are talking
about this once again on Thursday at

00:12:57.230 --> 00:12:57.240
about this once again on Thursday at
 

00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:00.140
about this once again on Thursday at
9:30 in a talk about dark-themed and

thanks we're gonna do a really quick

00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:06.150
thanks we're gonna do a really quick

webview had a recent change to introduce

00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:13.920
webview had a recent change to introduce
 

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:15.740

try chrome which is separating webview

00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:15.750
try chrome which is separating webview

from chrome they used to be a lockstep

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:17.130
from chrome they used to be a lockstep
 

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:18.890
from chrome they used to be a lockstep
so you update one you update the other

00:13:18.890 --> 00:13:18.900
so you update one you update the other
 

00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:21.590
so you update one you update the other
now they are more separate makes it a

00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:21.600
now they are more separate makes it a
 

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:22.910
now they are more separate makes it a
little bit easier to deal with that as a

00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:22.920
little bit easier to deal with that as a
 

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:23.540
little bit easier to deal with that as a

we also detect when the render is hung

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:25.890
we also detect when the render is hung
 

00:13:25.890 --> 00:13:27.560
we also detect when the render is hung
so it's easy to set a callback that

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:27.570
so it's easy to set a callback that
 

00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:29.270
so it's easy to set a callback that
callback and do something about it if

00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:29.280
callback and do something about it if
 

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:31.610
callback and do something about it if
you need to accessibility a couple of

00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:31.620
you need to accessibility a couple of
 

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:33.890
you need to accessibility a couple of
important changes it's way easier to set

00:13:33.890 --> 00:13:33.900
important changes it's way easier to set
 

00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:35.540
important changes it's way easier to set
accessibility actions now that's a

00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:35.550
accessibility actions now that's a
 

00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:38.750
accessibility actions now that's a

it's going to crash for them because we
end up changing an internal method

00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:50.950
end up changing an internal method
 

00:16:50.950 --> 00:16:53.010
end up changing an internal method
without realizing that you're using it

00:16:53.010 --> 00:16:53.020
without realizing that you're using it
 

00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:55.290
without realizing that you're using it
in a completely unexpected way and we've

00:16:55.290 --> 00:16:55.300
in a completely unexpected way and we've
 

00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:57.420
in a completely unexpected way and we've
seen applications that use reflection to

00:16:57.420 --> 00:16:57.430
seen applications that use reflection to
 

00:16:57.430 --> 00:16:59.430
seen applications that use reflection to
access fields that have had getters and

00:16:59.430 --> 00:16:59.440
access fields that have had getters and
 

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:03.270
access fields that have had getters and
setters since API level 1 so if you're

we're doing compiles doing the ahead of

00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:36.940
we're doing compiles doing the ahead of
 

00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:39.120
we're doing compiles doing the ahead of
time compiles we get the code we figure

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:39.130
time compiles we get the code we figure
 

00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:40.860
time compiles we get the code we figure
out what needs to be compiled on the

00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:40.870
out what needs to be compiled on the
 

00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:42.600
out what needs to be compiled on the
device we create that device code we

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:42.610
device we create that device code we
 

00:17:42.610 --> 00:17:45.300
device we create that device code we
upload all of these into the cloud and

00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:45.310
upload all of these into the cloud and
 

00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:46.950
upload all of these into the cloud and
we figure out ok what's the base set of

00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:46.960
we figure out ok what's the base set of
 

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:49.080
we figure out ok what's the base set of
stuff that needs to be pre compiled for

00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:49.090
stuff that needs to be pre compiled for
 

00:17:49.090 --> 00:17:50.820
stuff that needs to be pre compiled for
the apps but launched faster and now

00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:50.830
the apps but launched faster and now
 

00:17:50.830 --> 00:17:52.860
the apps but launched faster and now
when you install that application you

00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:52.870
when you install that application you
 

00:17:52.870 --> 00:17:55.140
when you install that application you
also install pre compiled code for your

00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:55.150
also install pre compiled code for your
 

00:17:55.150 --> 00:17:56.910
also install pre compiled code for your
device so you don't have to go through

00:17:56.910 --> 00:17:56.920
device so you don't have to go through
 

00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:58.770
device so you don't have to go through
the compilation step yourself because

00:17:58.770 --> 00:17:58.780
the compilation step yourself because
 

00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:00.870
the compilation step yourself because
other people did it across the world for

00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:00.880
other people did it across the world for
 

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:03.660
other people did it across the world for
you the team has also worked a lot on

00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:03.670
you the team has also worked a lot on
 

00:18:03.670 --> 00:18:05.430
you the team has also worked a lot on
startup improvements in general in

00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:05.440
startup improvements in general in
 

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:07.410
startup improvements in general in
addition to that other stuff and also

00:18:07.410 --> 00:18:07.420
addition to that other stuff and also
 

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:08.580
addition to that other stuff and also
worked on a generational garbage

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:08.590
worked on a generational garbage
 

00:18:08.590 --> 00:18:11.520
worked on a generational garbage
collector after art came out they they

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:11.530
collector after art came out they they
 

00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:13.680
collector after art came out they they
had a generational collector but that

00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:13.690
had a generational collector but that
 

00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:15.300
had a generational collector but that
was turned off I believe in the oh

00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:15.310
was turned off I believe in the oh
 

00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:17.880
was turned off I believe in the oh
really we give a talk on that yes we did

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:17.890
really we give a talk on that yes we did
 

00:18:17.890 --> 00:18:20.820
really we give a talk on that yes we did
and I'm sure we said oh and it was

00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:20.830
and I'm sure we said oh and it was
 

00:18:20.830 --> 00:18:22.380
and I'm sure we said oh and it was
because they came out with a new

00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:22.390
because they came out with a new
 

00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:24.300
because they came out with a new
concurrent collector and that didn't

00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:24.310
concurrent collector and that didn't
 

00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:25.980
concurrent collector and that didn't
work out to introduce that at that time

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:25.990
work out to introduce that at that time
 

00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:29.130
work out to introduce that at that time
so now we have a GC generational

00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:29.140
so now we have a GC generational
 

00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:31.320
so now we have a GC generational
collector again it collects new objects

00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:31.330
collector again it collects new objects
 

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:33.690
collector again it collects new objects
first so it turns out that a lot of the

00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:33.700
first so it turns out that a lot of the
 

00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:35.520
first so it turns out that a lot of the
garbage being created are things that

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:35.530
garbage being created are things that
 

00:18:35.530 --> 00:18:37.590
garbage being created are things that
are really transient objects so we can

00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:37.600
are really transient objects so we can
 

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:39.570
are really transient objects so we can
look through that list first it's much

00:18:39.570 --> 00:18:39.580
look through that list first it's much
 

00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:42.060
look through that list first it's much
smaller much quicker we can get all the

00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:42.070
smaller much quicker we can get all the
 

00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:43.230
smaller much quicker we can get all the
space that you need back

00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:43.240
space that you need back
 

00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:45.419
space that you need back
in most cases without doing a full GC

00:18:45.419 --> 00:18:45.429
in most cases without doing a full GC
 

00:18:45.429 --> 00:18:48.150
in most cases without doing a full GC
cheaper faster better and that's what

00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:48.160
cheaper faster better and that's what
 

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:50.610
cheaper faster better and that's what
we're all about there's a GC or art talk

00:18:50.610 --> 00:18:50.620
we're all about there's a GC or art talk
 

00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:53.010
we're all about there's a GC or art talk
Wednesday at 11:30 you should go to for

00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:53.020
Wednesday at 11:30 you should go to for
 

00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:55.110

so in the words of Chet in the keynote

00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:01.090
so in the words of Chet in the keynote
 

00:19:01.090 --> 00:19:03.180
so in the words of Chet in the keynote
this morning we are increasingly cutting

00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:03.190
this morning we are increasingly cutting
 

00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:04.460
this morning we are increasingly cutting
first whatever that means

00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:04.470
first whatever that means
 

00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:07.110
first whatever that means
so what this means that all the new API

00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:07.120
so what this means that all the new API
 

00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:08.669
so what this means that all the new API
is that were introduced in cue come with

00:19:08.669 --> 00:19:08.679
is that were introduced in cue come with
 

00:19:08.679 --> 00:19:10.470
is that were introduced in cue come with
no ability no ability annotation so

00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:10.480
no ability no ability annotation so
 

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:11.790
no ability no ability annotation so
that's very useful for curtains also

00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:11.800
that's very useful for curtains also
 

00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:12.870
that's very useful for curtains also
useful to use the java programming

00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:12.880
useful to use the java programming
 

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:15.299
useful to use the java programming
language and speaking of the annotations

00:19:15.299 --> 00:19:15.309
language and speaking of the annotations
 

00:19:15.309 --> 00:19:17.460
language and speaking of the annotations
now we enforced null ability as an error

00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:17.470
now we enforced null ability as an error
 

00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:18.990
now we enforced null ability as an error
and not as a warning anymore when your

00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:19.000
and not as a warning anymore when your
 

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.970
and not as a warning anymore when your
target cue so we will help you build

00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:20.980
target cue so we will help you build
 

00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:23.010

00:19:37.049 --> 00:19:37.059
processing in kpt so all right I'll just
 

00:19:37.059 --> 00:19:41.850
processing in kpt so all right I'll just
start using annotation processors and so

00:19:41.850 --> 00:19:41.860
start using annotation processors and so
 

00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:43.530
start using annotation processors and so

that's bizarre

00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:00.690
that's bizarre
 

00:25:00.690 --> 00:25:03.770

so I do work a lot with Chet and it does

00:25:03.770 --> 00:25:03.780
so I do work a lot with Chet and it does
 

00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:05.510
so I do work a lot with Chet and it does
make a lot of good jokes he also makes a

00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:05.520
make a lot of good jokes he also makes a
 

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:08.600
make a lot of good jokes he also makes a
lot of bad ones so I built myself a

00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:08.610
lot of bad ones so I built myself a
 

00:25:08.610 --> 00:25:10.669
lot of bad ones so I built myself a
small app to be able to count those bad

00:25:10.669 --> 00:25:10.679
small app to be able to count those bad
 

00:25:10.679 --> 00:25:12.590
small app to be able to count those bad
jokes and I'm going to show you how to

00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:12.600
jokes and I'm going to show you how to
 

00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:14.090
jokes and I'm going to show you how to
build an app so this is an ad that's

00:25:14.090 --> 00:25:14.100

using jetpack compos one of the things

00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:16.470
using jetpack compos one of the things
 

00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:17.960
using jetpack compos one of the things
that we want to do is we want to make it

00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:17.970
that we want to do is we want to make it
 

00:25:17.970 --> 00:25:19.549
that we want to do is we want to make it
a lot easier to create new widgets or

00:25:19.549 --> 00:25:19.559
a lot easier to create new widgets or
 

00:25:19.559 --> 00:25:20.490
a lot easier to create new widgets or
new component

00:25:20.490 --> 00:25:20.500
new component
 

00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:23.190
new component
and we jetpack compose a component it's

00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:23.200
and we jetpack compose a component it's
 

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:24.930
and we jetpack compose a component it's
just a single function so you have an

00:25:24.930 --> 00:25:24.940
just a single function so you have an
 

00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:26.430
just a single function so you have an
annotation here but we're not using an

00:25:26.430 --> 00:25:26.440
annotation here but we're not using an
 

00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:28.110
annotation here but we're not using an
annotation processor we're using a

00:25:28.110 --> 00:25:28.120
annotation processor we're using a
 

00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:30.420
annotation processor we're using a
cutting compiler plugin so all you have

00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:30.430
cutting compiler plugin so all you have
 

00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:32.130
cutting compiler plugin so all you have
to do is you create this function every

00:25:32.130 --> 00:25:32.140
to do is you create this function every
 

00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:33.990
to do is you create this function every
parameter of the function is effectively

00:25:33.990 --> 00:25:34.000
parameter of the function is effectively
 

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.120
parameter of the function is effectively
a parameter or property of your

00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:36.130
a parameter or property of your
 

00:25:36.130 --> 00:25:38.760
a parameter or property of your
component here I'm gonna add some state

00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:38.770
component here I'm gonna add some state
 

00:25:38.770 --> 00:25:40.860
component here I'm gonna add some state
so I'm not going to go into the details

00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:40.870
so I'm not going to go into the details
 

00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:42.270
so I'm not going to go into the details
but I'm just creating a counter it's

00:25:42.270 --> 00:25:42.280
but I'm just creating a counter it's
 

00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:44.130
but I'm just creating a counter it's
initialized to 0 it's back to its the

00:25:44.130 --> 00:25:44.140
initialized to 0 it's back to its the
 

00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:46.140
initialized to 0 it's back to its the
intro state of my component then I'm

00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:46.150
intro state of my component then I'm
 

00:25:46.150 --> 00:25:48.480
intro state of my component then I'm
gonna create a column which is the

00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:48.490
gonna create a column which is the
 

00:25:48.490 --> 00:25:50.580
gonna create a column which is the
account of a vertical linearlayout I'm

00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:50.590
account of a vertical linearlayout I'm
 

00:25:50.590 --> 00:25:54.330
account of a vertical linearlayout I'm
gonna put a button in it and you can see

00:25:54.330 --> 00:25:54.340
gonna put a button in it and you can see
 

00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:56.250
gonna put a button in it and you can see
that the button I just reused the title

00:25:56.250 --> 00:25:56.260
that the button I just reused the title
 

00:25:56.260 --> 00:25:58.620
that the button I just reused the title
parameter I received and in the unclick

00:25:58.620 --> 00:25:58.630
parameter I received and in the unclick
 

00:25:58.630 --> 00:26:00.960
parameter I received and in the unclick
property I can just increase the value

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:00.970
property I can just increase the value
 

00:26:00.970 --> 00:26:03.840
property I can just increase the value
of my counter then I want to display the

00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:03.850
of my counter then I want to display the
 

00:26:03.850 --> 00:26:05.700
of my counter then I want to display the
value of that counter and so I use a

00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:05.710
value of that counter and so I use a
 

00:26:05.710 --> 00:26:09.780
value of that counter and so I use a
label I'm just going to use again my

00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:09.790
label I'm just going to use again my
 

00:26:09.790 --> 00:26:14.880
label I'm just going to use again my
state bad jokes sorry and that's it now

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:14.890
state bad jokes sorry and that's it now
 

00:26:14.890 --> 00:26:17.790
state bad jokes sorry and that's it now
let's run this oh I forgot one thing I

00:26:17.790 --> 00:26:17.800
let's run this oh I forgot one thing I
 

00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:24.310

development so don't worry you will get
 

00:26:37.610 --> 00:26:40.180
development so don't worry you will get
better but here you have an entire app

00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:40.190
better but here you have an entire app
 

00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:42.460
better but here you have an entire app
that's really reactive as you can see I

corner with what we had well we really
 

00:28:42.570 --> 00:28:44.660
corner with what we had well we really
wanted was a view pager that was built

00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:44.670
wanted was a view pager that was built
 

00:28:44.670 --> 00:28:47.600
wanted was a view pager that was built
around a much more flexible model so we

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:47.610
around a much more flexible model so we
 

00:28:47.610 --> 00:28:50.060
around a much more flexible model so we
built this around recyclerview so

00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:50.070
built this around recyclerview so
 

00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:52.790
built this around recyclerview so
recyclerview capabilities but view pager

00:28:52.790 --> 00:28:52.800
recyclerview capabilities but view pager
 

00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:54.500

introduce soon something called view

00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:20.790
introduce soon something called view
 

00:29:20.790 --> 00:29:24.140
introduce soon something called view
bindings basically we want you to not

00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:24.150
bindings basically we want you to not
 

00:29:24.150 --> 00:29:26.300
bindings basically we want you to not
have to call find you buy ID anymore

00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:26.310
have to call find you buy ID anymore
 

00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:27.740
have to call find you buy ID anymore
we also don't want you to use annotation

00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:27.750
we also don't want you to use annotation
 

00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:29.450
we also don't want you to use annotation
postures with this because they tend to

00:29:29.450 --> 00:29:29.460
postures with this because they tend to
 

00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:31.970
postures with this because they tend to
slow down your your build so instead we

00:29:31.970 --> 00:29:31.980
slow down your your build so instead we
 

00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:35.360
slow down your your build so instead we
generate binding code from the XML outs

00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:35.370
generate binding code from the XML outs
 

00:29:35.370 --> 00:29:38.330
generate binding code from the XML outs
layouts directly it is now safe and it

00:29:38.330 --> 00:29:38.340
layouts directly it is now safe and it
 

00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:39.850

where you eat is going to talk about

00:29:44.289 --> 00:29:44.299
where you eat is going to talk about
 

00:29:44.299 --> 00:29:46.750
where you eat is going to talk about
this in a little more details but he has

00:29:46.750 --> 00:29:46.760
this in a little more details but he has
 

00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:48.280
this in a little more details but he has
an example we have a file called search

00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:48.290
an example we have a file called search
 

00:29:48.290 --> 00:29:51.430
an example we have a file called search
item that XML from that file at compile

00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:51.440
item that XML from that file at compile
 

00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:53.650
item that XML from that file at compile
time using the similar technology that

00:29:53.650 --> 00:29:53.660
time using the similar technology that
 

00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:55.450
time using the similar technology that
we use for data binding we generate a

00:29:55.450 --> 00:29:55.460
we use for data binding we generate a
 

00:29:55.460 --> 00:29:57.760
we use for data binding we generate a
class called search item bindings and

00:29:57.760 --> 00:29:57.770
class called search item bindings and
 

00:29:57.770 --> 00:29:59.740
class called search item bindings and
that search item bindings contains a

00:29:59.740 --> 00:29:59.750
that search item bindings contains a
 

00:29:59.750 --> 00:30:01.390
that search item bindings contains a
bunch of fields or properties that you

00:30:01.390 --> 00:30:01.400
bunch of fields or properties that you
 

00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:03.520
bunch of fields or properties that you
can use to access the views directly so

00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:03.530
can use to access the views directly so
 

00:30:03.530 --> 00:30:05.590
can use to access the views directly so
for instance the route view of this

00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:05.600
for instance the route view of this
 

00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:07.510
for instance the route view of this
layout is in a property called route

00:30:07.510 --> 00:30:07.520
layout is in a property called route
 

00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:09.070
layout is in a property called route
view so you can just say binding that

00:30:09.070 --> 00:30:09.080
view so you can just say binding that
 

00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:10.810
view so you can just say binding that
route view and that's it you have access

00:30:10.810 --> 00:30:10.820
route view and that's it you have access
 

00:30:10.820 --> 00:30:12.760
route view and that's it you have access
to that top-level view and as you can

00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:12.770
to that top-level view and as you can
 

00:30:12.770 --> 00:30:14.350
to that top-level view and as you can
see this also a text view called package

00:30:14.350 --> 00:30:14.360
see this also a text view called package
 

00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:16.360
see this also a text view called package
name and we again we have a property

00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:16.370
name and we again we have a property
 

00:30:16.370 --> 00:30:18.159
name and we again we have a property
called package name and it has the type

00:30:18.159 --> 00:30:18.169
called package name and it has the type
 

00:30:18.169 --> 00:30:19.990
called package name and it has the type
text view so you can call dot text on it

00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:20.000
text view so you can call dot text on it
 

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:21.669
text view so you can call dot text on it
directly and this thing is really smart

00:30:21.669 --> 00:30:21.679
directly and this thing is really smart
 

00:30:21.679 --> 00:30:23.380
directly and this thing is really smart
it looks at all the configuration for

00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:23.390
it looks at all the configuration for
 

00:30:23.390 --> 00:30:26.080
it looks at all the configuration for
that XML file and finds the type that

00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:26.090
that XML file and finds the type that
 

00:30:26.090 --> 00:30:28.230
that XML file and finds the type that
works across all the configurations

00:30:28.230 --> 00:30:28.240
works across all the configurations
 

00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:30.940
works across all the configurations
now graphics and media we're going to go

00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:30.950
now graphics and media we're going to go
 

00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:33.460
now graphics and media we're going to go
through this a little bit quickly so we

00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:33.470
through this a little bit quickly so we
 

00:30:33.470 --> 00:30:34.840
through this a little bit quickly so we
had this class called porter def that

00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:34.850
had this class called porter def that
 

00:30:34.850 --> 00:30:36.820
had this class called porter def that
mode on Android that was not documented

00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:36.830
mode on Android that was not documented
 

00:30:36.830 --> 00:30:38.950
mode on Android that was not documented
for the longest time it's very confusing

00:30:38.950 --> 00:30:38.960
for the longest time it's very confusing
 

00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:40.450
for the longest time it's very confusing
because it contains modes that have

00:30:40.450 --> 00:30:40.460
because it contains modes that have
 

00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:42.549
because it contains modes that have
nothing to do with poplar and death so

00:30:42.549 --> 00:30:42.559
nothing to do with poplar and death so
 

00:30:42.559 --> 00:30:44.380
nothing to do with poplar and death so
in queue we're introducing a new class

00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:44.390
in queue we're introducing a new class
 

00:30:44.390 --> 00:30:45.850
in queue we're introducing a new class
called blend mode that basically

00:30:45.850 --> 00:30:45.860
called blend mode that basically
 

00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:48.100
called blend mode that basically
replaces photo def that mode what other

00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:48.110
replaces photo def that mode what other
 

00:30:48.110 --> 00:30:49.840
replaces photo def that mode what other
that mode still works but we are also

00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:49.850
that mode still works but we are also
 

00:30:49.850 --> 00:30:52.870
that mode still works but we are also
adding missing modes like hard light and

00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:52.880
adding missing modes like hard light and
 

00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:54.580
adding missing modes like hard light and
soft light so basically now we have all

00:30:54.580 --> 00:30:54.590
soft light so basically now we have all
 

00:30:54.590 --> 00:30:56.590
soft light so basically now we have all
the modes that you can find in sketch or

00:30:56.590 --> 00:30:56.600
the modes that you can find in sketch or
 

00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:58.150
the modes that you can find in sketch or
Adobe Photoshop and applications like

00:30:58.150 --> 00:30:58.160
Adobe Photoshop and applications like
 

00:30:58.160 --> 00:30:59.799
Adobe Photoshop and applications like
this so that should make your designer

00:30:59.799 --> 00:30:59.809
this so that should make your designer
 

00:30:59.809 --> 00:31:00.430
this so that should make your designer

we're also exposing an API called render

00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:02.630
we're also exposing an API called render
 

00:31:02.630 --> 00:31:04.570
we're also exposing an API called render
node this is what we use for hardware

00:31:04.570 --> 00:31:04.580
node this is what we use for hardware
 

00:31:04.580 --> 00:31:06.720

acceleration inside the UI toolkit so

00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:06.730
acceleration inside the UI toolkit so
 

00:31:06.730 --> 00:31:08.680
acceleration inside the UI toolkit so
yeah it's just by the views internally

00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:08.690
yeah it's just by the views internally
 

00:31:08.690 --> 00:31:10.690
yeah it's just by the views internally
and it contains the display so it's all

00:31:10.690 --> 00:31:10.700
and it contains the display so it's all
 

00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:12.909
and it contains the display so it's all
the join comments that you issue on a

00:31:12.909 --> 00:31:12.919
the join comments that you issue on a
 

00:31:12.919 --> 00:31:15.010
the join comments that you issue on a
canvas one in your on draw function it

00:31:15.010 --> 00:31:15.020
canvas one in your on draw function it
 

00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:17.020
canvas one in your on draw function it
also contains this page properties such

00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:17.030
also contains this page properties such
 

00:31:17.030 --> 00:31:19.330
also contains this page properties such
as rotation alpha scale and things like

00:31:19.330 --> 00:31:19.340
as rotation alpha scale and things like
 

00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:21.460
as rotation alpha scale and things like
this and a render node can contain other

00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:21.470
this and a render node can contain other
 

00:31:21.470 --> 00:31:23.350
this and a render node can contain other
render nodes so you can build a tree of

00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:23.360
render nodes so you can build a tree of
 

00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:24.640
render nodes so you can build a tree of
render nodes for super efficient

00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:24.650
render nodes for super efficient
 

00:31:24.650 --> 00:31:27.100
render nodes for super efficient
rendering so here's I use them you just

00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:27.110
rendering so here's I use them you just
 

00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:28.630
rendering so here's I use them you just
create a new instance you give you the

00:31:28.630 --> 00:31:28.640
create a new instance you give you the
 

00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:31.510
create a new instance you give you the
position and the size then by calling

00:31:31.510 --> 00:31:31.520
position and the size then by calling
 

00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:33.640

begin recording you get a special canvas

00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:33.650
begin recording you get a special canvas
 

00:31:33.650 --> 00:31:35.590
begin recording you get a special canvas
that you can use to record comments on

00:31:35.590 --> 00:31:35.600
that you can use to record comments on
 

00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:37.930
that you can use to record comments on
the the render node itself and when you

00:31:37.930 --> 00:31:37.940
the the render node itself and when you
 

00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:39.850
the the render node itself and when you
don't done you called end recording then

00:31:39.850 --> 00:31:39.860
don't done you called end recording then
 

00:31:39.860 --> 00:31:41.710
don't done you called end recording then
you can manipulate the properties so if

00:31:41.710 --> 00:31:41.720
you can manipulate the properties so if
 

00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:43.090
you can manipulate the properties so if
you want to fade the content of that

00:31:43.090 --> 00:31:43.100
you want to fade the content of that
 

00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:45.130

you're on draw method you have to check

00:31:54.419 --> 00:31:54.429
you're on draw method you have to check
 

00:31:54.429 --> 00:31:56.190
you're on draw method you have to check
that the canvas you're gonna render onto

00:31:56.190 --> 00:31:56.200
that the canvas you're gonna render onto
 

00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:57.870
that the canvas you're gonna render onto
is hot works already and if it is you

00:31:57.870 --> 00:31:57.880
is hot works already and if it is you
 

00:31:57.880 --> 00:31:59.940

can call the raw render node and pass

00:31:59.940 --> 00:31:59.950
can call the raw render node and pass
 

00:31:59.950 --> 00:32:02.759
can call the raw render node and pass
the render node you just created you can

00:32:02.759 --> 00:32:02.769
the render node you just created you can
 

00:32:02.769 --> 00:32:04.230
the render node you just created you can
use render node to create shadows

00:32:04.230 --> 00:32:04.240
use render node to create shadows
 

00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:06.149
use render node to create shadows
without using a view a render node can

00:32:06.149 --> 00:32:06.159
without using a view a render node can
 

00:32:06.159 --> 00:32:07.980
without using a view a render node can
have an outline so now you don't need to

00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:07.990
have an outline so now you don't need to
 

00:32:07.990 --> 00:32:10.200
have an outline so now you don't need to
create a brand-new view which is a very

00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:10.210
create a brand-new view which is a very
 

00:32:10.210 --> 00:32:11.940
create a brand-new view which is a very
heavy object just to create a shadow

00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:11.950
heavy object just to create a shadow
 

00:32:11.950 --> 00:32:13.279
heavy object just to create a shadow
inside your custom view for instance

00:32:13.279 --> 00:32:13.289

we're also exposing something called a
 

00:32:15.669 --> 00:32:17.159
we're also exposing something called a
Hardware renderer which is what we use

00:32:17.159 --> 00:32:17.169
Hardware renderer which is what we use
 

00:32:17.169 --> 00:32:19.710
Hardware renderer which is what we use
to render the render nodes so again used

00:32:19.710 --> 00:32:19.720
to render the render nodes so again used
 

00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:21.840
to render the render nodes so again used
by the tool kit is only in renders all

00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:21.850
by the tool kit is only in renders all
 

00:32:21.850 --> 00:32:24.659
by the tool kit is only in renders all
those nodes onto a surface the cool

00:32:24.659 --> 00:32:24.669
those nodes onto a surface the cool
 

00:32:24.669 --> 00:32:25.950
those nodes onto a surface the cool
thing about how do i render is that it

00:32:25.950 --> 00:32:25.960
thing about how do i render is that it
 

00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:27.480
thing about how do i render is that it
lets you control control the light

00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:27.490
lets you control control the light
 

00:32:27.490 --> 00:32:30.090
lets you control control the light
source that you that we use in metal

00:32:30.090 --> 00:32:30.100
source that you that we use in metal
 

00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:31.769
source that you that we use in metal
design so we measured then we cast

00:32:31.769 --> 00:32:31.779
design so we measured then we cast
 

00:32:31.779 --> 00:32:34.080
design so we measured then we cast
dynamic shadows on all the objects with

00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:34.090
dynamic shadows on all the objects with
 

00:32:34.090 --> 00:32:35.249
dynamic shadows on all the objects with
the position of the light source has

00:32:35.249 --> 00:32:35.259
the position of the light source has
 

00:32:35.259 --> 00:32:36.899
the position of the light source has
been fixed by the designers with

00:32:36.899 --> 00:32:36.909
been fixed by the designers with
 

00:32:36.909 --> 00:32:38.310
been fixed by the designers with
hardware render you can move that light

00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:38.320
hardware render you can move that light
 

00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:39.690

source around for pretty interesting

00:32:39.690 --> 00:32:39.700
source around for pretty interesting
 

00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:41.279
source around for pretty interesting
effects so here's how it works

00:32:41.279 --> 00:32:41.289
effects so here's how it works
 

00:32:41.289 --> 00:32:43.289
effects so here's how it works
you create a hollow renderer you give it

00:32:43.289 --> 00:32:43.299
you create a hollow renderer you give it
 

00:32:43.299 --> 00:32:45.779
you create a hollow renderer you give it
a surface then you set the content root

00:32:45.779 --> 00:32:45.789
a surface then you set the content root
 

00:32:45.789 --> 00:32:48.240
a surface then you set the content root
of the renderer as a render node and

00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:48.250
of the renderer as a render node and
 

00:32:48.250 --> 00:32:50.730
of the renderer as a render node and
then you just request for a frame to be

00:32:50.730 --> 00:32:50.740
then you just request for a frame to be
 

00:32:50.740 --> 00:32:54.539
then you just request for a frame to be
issued here are the methods you can use

00:32:54.539 --> 00:32:54.549
issued here are the methods you can use
 

00:32:54.549 --> 00:32:55.740
issued here are the methods you can use
to control the light source we can

00:32:55.740 --> 00:32:55.750
to control the light source we can
 

00:32:55.750 --> 00:32:57.629
to control the light source we can
change the alpha of the ambient shadows

00:32:57.629 --> 00:32:57.639
change the alpha of the ambient shadows
 

00:32:57.639 --> 00:32:59.159
change the alpha of the ambient shadows
and the directions and you can also

00:32:59.159 --> 00:32:59.169
and the directions and you can also
 

00:32:59.169 --> 00:33:01.289
and the directions and you can also
change the position and the size of the

00:33:01.289 --> 00:33:01.299
change the position and the size of the
 

00:33:01.299 --> 00:33:03.299
change the position and the size of the
light source so here's a quick demo that

00:33:03.299 --> 00:33:03.309
light source so here's a quick demo that
 

00:33:03.309 --> 00:33:07.080
light source so here's a quick demo that
shows you what you can do okay let's try

00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:07.090
shows you what you can do okay let's try
 

00:33:07.090 --> 00:33:10.700
shows you what you can do okay let's try
this again

00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:10.710
 

00:33:10.710 --> 00:33:12.749
okay the shadow should be moving around

00:33:12.749 --> 00:33:12.759
okay the shadow should be moving around
 

00:33:12.759 --> 00:33:14.730
okay the shadow should be moving around
and changing ah here we go

00:33:14.730 --> 00:33:14.740
and changing ah here we go
 

00:33:14.740 --> 00:33:18.119
and changing ah here we go
I have no luck with demos today as you

00:33:18.119 --> 00:33:18.129
I have no luck with demos today as you
 

00:33:18.129 --> 00:33:19.529
I have no luck with demos today as you
can see we're not moving the object and

00:33:19.529 --> 00:33:19.539
can see we're not moving the object and
 

00:33:19.539 --> 00:33:20.999
can see we're not moving the object and
the shadow is only moving and changing

00:33:20.999 --> 00:33:21.009
the shadow is only moving and changing
 

00:33:21.009 --> 00:33:22.740
the shadow is only moving and changing
blur because the light source itself is

00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:22.750
blur because the light source itself is
 

00:33:22.750 --> 00:33:25.590
blur because the light source itself is
moving around how do i bitmaps that is

00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:25.600
moving around how do i bitmaps that is
 

00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:27.269
moving around how do i bitmaps that is
not a new API but now a hollow a bitmap

00:33:27.269 --> 00:33:27.279
not a new API but now a hollow a bitmap
 

00:33:27.279 --> 00:33:29.639

00:33:45.970 --> 00:33:48.119
happens every time you modify a regular
bitmap and basically you can use it to

00:33:48.119 --> 00:33:48.129
bitmap and basically you can use it to
 

00:33:48.129 --> 00:33:49.980
bitmap and basically you can use it to
wrap surfaces so here I have an example

00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:49.990
wrap surfaces so here I have an example
 

00:33:49.990 --> 00:33:52.649
wrap surfaces so here I have an example
it's a very silly example but it's a lot

00:33:52.649 --> 00:33:52.659
it's a very silly example but it's a lot
 

00:33:52.659 --> 00:33:55.080
it's a very silly example but it's a lot
lotty animation that's using Hardware

00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:55.090
lotty animation that's using Hardware
 

00:33:55.090 --> 00:33:57.149
lotty animation that's using Hardware
rendering to render into a surface then

00:33:57.149 --> 00:33:57.159
rendering to render into a surface then
 

00:33:57.159 --> 00:33:59.249
rendering to render into a surface then
it's wrapped into a bitmap that said as

00:33:59.249 --> 00:33:59.259
it's wrapped into a bitmap that said as
 

00:33:59.259 --> 00:34:01.619
it's wrapped into a bitmap that said as
a bitmap shader on the paint that's used

00:34:01.619 --> 00:34:01.629
a bitmap shader on the paint that's used
 

00:34:01.629 --> 00:34:03.840
a bitmap shader on the paint that's used
to draw the text it could be a video it

00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:03.850
to draw the text it could be a video it
 

00:34:03.850 --> 00:34:05.370
to draw the text it could be a video it
could be OpenGL rendering so

00:34:05.370 --> 00:34:05.380
could be OpenGL rendering so
 

00:34:05.380 --> 00:34:06.720
could be OpenGL rendering so
do a lot of really cool things in your

00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:06.730
do a lot of really cool things in your
 

00:34:06.730 --> 00:34:09.600
do a lot of really cool things in your
application and I'm going to keep the

00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:09.610
application and I'm going to keep the
 

00:34:09.610 --> 00:34:11.730
application and I'm going to keep the
code itself basically we use an image

00:34:11.730 --> 00:34:11.740
code itself basically we use an image
 

00:34:11.740 --> 00:34:13.260
code itself basically we use an image
reader you have to create a new instance

00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:13.270
reader you have to create a new instance
 

00:34:13.270 --> 00:34:15.090
reader you have to create a new instance
an image reader will give you a surface

00:34:15.090 --> 00:34:15.100
an image reader will give you a surface
 

00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:17.879
an image reader will give you a surface
that you can use to render onto either

00:34:17.879 --> 00:34:17.889
that you can use to render onto either
 

00:34:17.889 --> 00:34:19.770
that you can use to render onto either
by locking the the canvas or giving it

00:34:19.770 --> 00:34:19.780
by locking the the canvas or giving it
 

00:34:19.780 --> 00:34:21.510
by locking the the canvas or giving it
to the hardware renderer and every time

00:34:21.510 --> 00:34:21.520
to the hardware renderer and every time
 

00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:23.970
to the hardware renderer and every time
an image is available you can acquire a

00:34:23.970 --> 00:34:23.980
an image is available you can acquire a
 

00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:25.619
an image is available you can acquire a
hardware buffer and then you can call

00:34:25.619 --> 00:34:25.629
hardware buffer and then you can call
 

00:34:25.629 --> 00:34:27.990
hardware buffer and then you can call
bitmap that wrap hardware buffer to get

00:34:27.990 --> 00:34:28.000
bitmap that wrap hardware buffer to get
 

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:30.119
bitmap that wrap hardware buffer to get
an actual bitmap and then finally we can

00:34:30.119 --> 00:34:30.129
an actual bitmap and then finally we can
 

00:34:30.129 --> 00:34:31.860
an actual bitmap and then finally we can
use that bitmap inside the bitmap shader

00:34:31.860 --> 00:34:31.870
use that bitmap inside the bitmap shader
 

00:34:31.870 --> 00:34:35.100
use that bitmap inside the bitmap shader
so in summary this is all the classes

00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:35.110
so in summary this is all the classes
 

00:34:35.110 --> 00:34:36.659
so in summary this is all the classes
you need to make this work it's very

00:34:36.659 --> 00:34:36.669
you need to make this work it's very
 

00:34:36.669 --> 00:34:39.000
you need to make this work it's very
simple and self-explanatory I'm gonna

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:39.010
simple and self-explanatory I'm gonna
 

00:34:39.010 --> 00:34:41.010
simple and self-explanatory I'm gonna
move on I think those are all the

00:34:41.010 --> 00:34:41.020
move on I think those are all the
 

00:34:41.020 --> 00:34:42.659
move on I think those are all the
graphics classes we have in the platform

00:34:42.659 --> 00:34:42.669
graphics classes we have in the platform
 

00:34:42.669 --> 00:34:45.810
graphics classes we have in the platform
pretty much surface control is a way to

00:34:45.810 --> 00:34:45.820
pretty much surface control is a way to
 

00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:48.570
pretty much surface control is a way to
talk to surface flinger directly again

00:34:48.570 --> 00:34:48.580
talk to surface flinger directly again
 

00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:49.770
talk to surface flinger directly again

16-bit color depth unfortunately it was

00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:33.520
16-bit color depth unfortunately it was
 

00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:35.250
16-bit color depth unfortunately it was
using a lot of memory it was also using

00:35:35.250 --> 00:35:35.260
using a lot of memory it was also using
 

00:35:35.260 --> 00:35:37.800
using a lot of memory it was also using
a lot of battery so now we use 8-bit

00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:37.810
a lot of battery so now we use 8-bit
 

00:35:37.810 --> 00:35:39.960
a lot of battery so now we use 8-bit
color depth and it solves this issues
