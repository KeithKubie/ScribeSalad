00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.160
- [speaking spanish]

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:09.600
[speaking spanish]

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:11.544
[speaking spanish]

00:00:11.644 --> 00:00:15.681
Two of my senior guys violated
an SOP written in blood.

00:00:15.781 --> 00:00:17.283
We were committed, bro.

00:00:17.383 --> 00:00:18.918
No, you ran off after a
squirter with a suicide vest.

00:00:19.018 --> 00:00:21.086
No.
That squirter was our HVI.

00:00:21.187 --> 00:00:23.956
What were we supposed to
do, just let the guy go?

00:00:24.056 --> 00:00:25.692
- Alex?
- You all right?

00:00:25.792 --> 00:00:29.295
You still getting
those headaches?

00:00:29.395 --> 00:00:32.231
My asset from Bosnia, John,
you know him as the Prince.

00:00:32.331 --> 00:00:33.666
They knew we were coming.

00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:36.169
God, did you screw us?

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:37.737
John betrayed me.

00:00:37.837 --> 00:00:40.139
We think the Russians helped
him become the prince.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.175
We need to spend
some time apart.

00:00:42.275 --> 00:00:43.643
Things have to change.

00:00:43.743 --> 00:00:44.811
We have to change.

00:00:44.911 --> 00:00:46.512
It's lonely at the top, Joe.

00:00:46.612 --> 00:00:50.249
No God to believe in, a country
that doesn't believe in you.

00:00:50.349 --> 00:00:52.685
I want you to go away now.

00:00:52.785 --> 00:00:55.821
You know that avatar,
Golden Boy, the Prince?

00:00:55.922 --> 00:00:57.156
He ordered your death, Michael.

00:00:57.256 --> 00:00:59.392
He told Muttaqi to
give you to Boko Haram.

00:00:59.492 --> 00:01:02.094
Where is he?

00:01:02.194 --> 00:01:04.330
My end of the deal.
