00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.930
know when an economist was in fourth
grade but I knew that I wanted to do

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:33.940
grade but I knew that I wanted to do
 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.110
grade but I knew that I wanted to do
something like that and so from that

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:37.120
something like that and so from that
 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.420
something like that and so from that
time on I you know sort of focused on

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:39.430
time on I you know sort of focused on
 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.250

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:41.260
things related to business and economics
 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.479

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:45.489
so I kind of remember that day and I
 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:47.280
so I kind of remember that day and I

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:48.600
remember that project and I remember how
much I enjoyed it and I thought I was

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:48.610
much I enjoyed it and I thought I was
 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:50.700
much I enjoyed it and I thought I was
good at it I thought I had insight and

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:50.710
good at it I thought I had insight and
 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.399
good at it I thought I had insight and
so from that day forward I was headed

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:53.409
so from that day forward I was headed
 

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:56.980
so from that day forward I was headed
towards being an economist

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:56.990
 
 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:00.960
 
yeah I do I think it's not taught

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:00.970
yeah I do I think it's not taught
 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.390
yeah I do I think it's not taught
properly at high school if I were

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400
properly at high school if I were
 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.250
properly at high school if I were
teaching in high school I focus on

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.260
teaching in high school I focus on
 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.820
teaching in high school I focus on
personal finance issues you know I when

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830
personal finance issues you know I when
 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.100
personal finance issues you know I when
I got asked out of high school I could

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110
I got asked out of high school I could
 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:13.540
I got asked out of high school I could
make a pretty good omelet but I didn't

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:13.550
make a pretty good omelet but I didn't
 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:15.430
make a pretty good omelet but I didn't
even know what a mortgage was and I

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:15.440
even know what a mortgage was and I
 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.220
even know what a mortgage was and I
think that's a mistake in I think that's

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:18.230
think that's a mistake in I think that's
 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:19.930
think that's a mistake in I think that's
one of the reasons why we're in the mess

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:19.940
one of the reasons why we're in the mess
 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.530
one of the reasons why we're in the mess
we're in why all those millions of bad

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540
we're in why all those millions of bad
 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:24.850
we're in why all those millions of bad
loans were made because people really

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860
loans were made because people really
 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.340
loans were made because people really
did not truly did not understand what

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350
did not truly did not understand what
 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.740
did not truly did not understand what
they were getting into so I think the

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750
they were getting into so I think the
 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.070
they were getting into so I think the
high school curriculum should change and

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080
high school curriculum should change and
 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.780
high school curriculum should change and
Home Economics should be more about the

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790
Home Economics should be more about the
 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.359
Home Economics should be more about the
economics than the home I think that'd

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369
economics than the home I think that'd
 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:39.090
economics than the home I think that'd
be my view and then I think in

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100
be my view and then I think in
 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.870
be my view and then I think in
universities it tends to be the teaching

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880
universities it tends to be the teaching
 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.450
universities it tends to be the teaching
is sort of moved towards the highly

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460
is sort of moved towards the highly
 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.700
is sort of moved towards the highly
theoretical very mathematically oriented

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710
theoretical very mathematically oriented
 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.120
theoretical very mathematically oriented
and it kind of loses touch with reality

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130
and it kind of loses touch with reality
 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.350
and it kind of loses touch with reality
what's happening really in our economy

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360
what's happening really in our economy
 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.650
what's happening really in our economy
in the real world and i think that's to

00:01:59.650 --> 00:01:59.660
in the real world and i think that's to
 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:04.330
in the real world and i think that's to
the detriment of the profession and it's

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340
the detriment of the profession and it's
 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.090
the detriment of the profession and it's
a relevancy to you know our everyday

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100
a relevancy to you know our everyday
 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.870
a relevancy to you know our everyday
life so i think it's important that

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880
life so i think it's important that
 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.300
life so i think it's important that
universities at least make an effort to

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310
universities at least make an effort to
 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.460
universities at least make an effort to
get back to more practically oriented

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470
get back to more practically oriented
 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.100
get back to more practically oriented
kinds of economic analysis or at least

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110
kinds of economic analysis or at least
 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:19.960
kinds of economic analysis or at least
doing economic theory that they can

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970
doing economic theory that they can
 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.570
doing economic theory that they can
ground in terms of into something that's

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580
ground in terms of into something that's
 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.330
ground in terms of into something that's
practical oh I think we've lost that or

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340
practical oh I think we've lost that or
 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:26.620
practical oh I think we've lost that or
losing that and there are very few

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630
losing that and there are very few
 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.670
losing that and there are very few
economist that really can step out of

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680
economist that really can step out of
 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.320
economist that really can step out of
the theoretical world and really make an

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330
the theoretical world and really make an
 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.450
the theoretical world and really make an
impact on what's happening to every two

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:34.460
impact on what's happening to every two
 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:38.010
impact on what's happening to every two
people's daily lives

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020
 
 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.560

recovery that we're now in unravels back

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:13.990
recovery that we're now in unravels back
 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:15.660
recovery that we're now in unravels back
into a recession and if we get back into

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670
into a recession and if we get back into
 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.510
into a recession and if we get back into
recession I don't think it's going to be
