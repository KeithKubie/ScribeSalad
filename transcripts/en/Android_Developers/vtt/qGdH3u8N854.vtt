00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:00.670
TOM GRINSTED: Hello, everyone.

00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:01.680
I'm Tom Grinsted.

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:03.590
I'm Group Product Manager
for Mobile Devices

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:04.340
at "The Guardian."

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:07.450
I'm also really, really aware
that I'm the final lightning

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:09.440
talk in the final session
of the day, so I'm

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.510
going to make it as lightning
as possible because, you know,

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:14.720
drinks.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.570
So I'm really going
to talk about how

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.590
we've tried, especially in the
apps team over the last year,

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.630
to introduce some new ways
of working to really unlock

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.070
the creativity that's
embedded in development

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:28.237
teams themselves.

00:00:28.237 --> 00:00:30.070
It seemed quite a long
time for the industry

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:32.236
in general, and to be frank,
the publishing industry

00:00:32.236 --> 00:00:36.180
specifically, to
understand that development

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.290
is a creative process
in and of itself,

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.560
and teams of developers
and designers

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.220
have really creative ideas.

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.310
And the toss for us is to
really try to unlock them.

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:48.410
Now there are loads of different
ways to try to unlock ideas

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.475
and to try to get features
out to the public,

00:00:50.475 --> 00:00:53.320
and there are loads of different
ways to plot them as well.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.770
But for the sake
of this talk, I'm

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:56.940
going to plot them along
two different axes.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.190
So along the x-axis,
then you've got

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:02.810
kind of self-led
creativity-- ideas

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.570
that you come up on
you own, yourself,

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:06.850
and you try to happen.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.090
And at the other end,
you've got imposed

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.940
creativity-- stuff that's
given to you by other people.

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.770
And then along the y-axis,
we've got business return.

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.899
So you've got features that when
they're eventually deployed,

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:23.440
give really, really high value
to the business and high value

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:24.340
to your users.

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.590
And it's worth saying those
two things are essentially

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.120
synonymous, and you've got
things that are low value,

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.470
so either that
nobody uses or that

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.420
don't help the business at all.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.920
So what I'm going
to do is I'm going

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.580
to look at a few different
ways that we work

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.030
and how they plot along
these different axes.

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.680
So what would be a good
example of the top right?

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.252
Well, strategic features, right?

00:01:47.252 --> 00:01:48.710
If they're strategic
features, they

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.520
might be very, very
high value because it's

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.150
aligning to the entire
strategy of your business,

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.040
and they're also likely to be
imposed because the business is

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.260
saying, team, I really
need you to do this.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.340
In our case, it might be, team,
I really need you to get many,

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.619
many more users
signed into the app.

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:08.160
Then you've got
things like backlogs.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.090
Now I'd argue the
backlogs, the tend

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.010
towards being slightly
more self-creative

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.459
because developers, especially
in functioning agile teams,

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.125
can go and pick up
cards that they think

00:02:17.125 --> 00:02:18.610
are really important.

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.780
But they do tend
towards being imposed.

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.490
People like me help
kind of shape backlogs.

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.560
Then you've got bad ideas.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.300
Bad ideas they
tend towards being,

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.480
well, especially bad ideas
from senior management--

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.550
I'm admitting to this-- impose
creativity at a low value.

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.120
We really need to do this, team.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.420
Crap, it's failed.

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:45.780
Then you've bugs and debt.

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.090
Now, I was trying to
decide where to put this.

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.417
So our teams at "The
Guardian" are really

00:02:51.417 --> 00:02:54.000
enabled to genuinely care about
the quality of their products,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.880
and they pick up individual
bugs, individual pieces

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.254
of debt, add them
when they think

00:02:57.254 --> 00:02:58.780
it's really, really important.

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.435
Now individually, they tend
towards being low value.

00:03:02.435 --> 00:03:04.060
Although I don't want
you guys to think

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.270
I'm not saying that
quality is important.

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.070
Quite the opposite--
quality is critical.

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.610
Taken together, they might
be all the way up there.

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:12.720
But if you look at them
on an individual basis,

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.590
they're comparatively
low quality,

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.810
but they're slightly
more self-led.

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.110
Now, the next we're going
to look is hack days.

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.750
Keep your hands up if you
know what a hack day is?

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.300
OK, so not huge numbers.

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.495
Keep you hand up if you've
participated in a hack day?

00:03:28.495 --> 00:03:30.750
OK, roughly the same
number of numbers.

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.415
OK, so a hack day
is where you get

00:03:32.415 --> 00:03:34.540
loads and loads of developers
into a room together,

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.430
and you say, go away and build
something and demo at the end.

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.830
So it's kind of in some
ways the purest example

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.090
of self-led creativity.

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.450
Now, sometimes hack day
projects are hugely valuable.

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:49.325
In fact, "The Guardian"
has an internal suite

00:03:49.325 --> 00:03:52.560
of analytics called Ophan,
which is phenomenal.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:53.830
It's fantastic.

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:56.150
That grew out of one
of our hack days.

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.170
But very often-- so
it's worth saying,

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:59.920
that would be all
the way up here.

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.840
But very often,
hack day projects

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.384
don't align to
the strategic aims

00:04:04.384 --> 00:04:06.550
because they're really an
opportunity for developers

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:08.810
to go away and play.

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:10.400
Sometimes they're
an amazing idea,

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.400
but they don't have enough
resource behind them,

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.290
and they can't do
because of other things

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:15.670
the business is doing.

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.350
Sometimes, frankly, they're
just trying to the crowd.

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.880
So sometimes hack idea ideas
are very, very high value.

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.330
But very often
than not, hack days

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.475
have a low hit rate for long
term value to the business.

00:04:27.475 --> 00:04:29.600
Now by this way I'm talking
about feature specific.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.766
There are loads of other
really, really good reasons

00:04:31.766 --> 00:04:34.750
to do hack days-- giving
your developers a chance

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:35.950
to work together.

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:39.890
It's a fantastic tool to
get people who never talk

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:41.770
to each other actually talking.

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.020
But if you're being brutal
about just single features,

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.612
hack days, in and of
themselves, aren't long enough

00:04:46.612 --> 00:04:48.820
and aren't focused enough
to have a consistent return

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:49.528
for the business.

00:04:49.528 --> 00:04:53.980
 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:57.750
So for me, the key question
is, what can fit here?

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:59.940
Can you construct
a way of working

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.990
which is both very
high value, unleashes

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:05.300
the creativity of your
development teams,

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.600
and has a really good
return for the business?

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.820
And for us, the thing that
fits in that question mark

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:12.429
is the build week.

00:05:12.429 --> 00:05:13.970
Now, the build week,
as you my guess,

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:16.340
is a bit like a hack day,
but instead of just hacking

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.673
something together as quickly
as you can just to demo it

00:05:18.673 --> 00:05:20.220
to an audience, you
built it, and you

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:23.190
build a to point where
it's in principle testable.

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.157
Instead of being a
day, it's a week.

00:05:25.157 --> 00:05:27.490
And the reason it's a week
is that gives our development

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:31.120
teams and engineers
and UX designers

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.380
enough time to actually
build something which

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:35.500
is really, really compelling.

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.370
But like a hack day, it
unleashes their creativity

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:43.250
by giving a huge amount
of self-awareness,

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:45.870
so they really get to choose
what they're going to build.

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:47.700
And there area few rules to it.

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:52.100
The first in this important to
unleashing the strategic value,

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:54.070
is there's a strategic theme.

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:55.900
So ones that we've
run over the last year

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:57.820
have been about
mobile monetization,

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:01.350
around editorial innovation,
around key personalization,

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:05.310
and about making our apps
quicker and more responsive.

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:06.880
Solutions aren't imposed.

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.400
The job for someone like me
is to simply get the them,

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:12.140
and then allow the teams,
as large as they can be,

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:14.510
to get on and come up with
the most creative ideas they

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:17.700
can on their own to
try to meet that theme.

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:21.640
We take time at the
beginning of the build week

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:24.690
to deeply understand
what we're trying to do.

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:26.980
And critically, the
output is testable.

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:28.650
This needs to be
able to go somewhere

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:31.850
where we get actual
feedback from actual uses.

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:35.210
So this is an example of one of
the hack weeks we ran recently.

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:36.850
This is my lovely
team working on it.

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:39.440
It's worth pointing out that
the team isn't just engineers.

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:40.398
You've got Frank there.

00:06:40.398 --> 00:06:41.100
He's a designer.

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:42.058
You've got [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:42.058 --> 00:06:43.490
He's our mobile editor.

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:45.924
You've got Helen up there,
who's a UX researcher.

00:06:45.924 --> 00:06:47.840
For our hack weeks we
try to make a team which

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:50.317
is as broad as possible.

00:06:50.317 --> 00:06:51.900
Now, I said that one
of the key things

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:53.180
is the output is testable.

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:54.930
And I wanted to kind
of dwell a little bit

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:55.904
on what I meant there.

00:06:55.904 --> 00:06:57.570
Because the idea of
build week is you're

00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:00.870
coming up with tangible,
useful things for users.

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:02.780
So what do I mean by testable?

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:05.970
Well, at one end, you've
got testing in our UX lab.

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:08.024
Now, that's great,
but really what

00:07:08.024 --> 00:07:10.440
we're looking for for build
week is something which can be

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:12.826
tested slightly further afield.

00:07:12.826 --> 00:07:14.200
Then we've got
our alpha program.

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:17.190
Now, we use the alpha
program on Google Play

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:19.410
to do nightly builds
of our Android apps

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:21.220
that go out to any
of the internal users

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:22.930
within in "The Guardian."

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:25.010
And the alpha program
is a fantastic way,

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:27.340
at the end of a build
week, to test stability

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:29.450
across 600 users.

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:32.587
It's also great to get
stakeholders really excited.

00:07:32.587 --> 00:07:34.170
There's nothing like
somebody suddenly

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:35.470
seeing a feature they
didn't know existed

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:38.060
for the first time that really
answers one of the needs

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:40.560
to get it rapidly
into production.

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:41.880
We also use a beta program.

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:43.540
And if you're interested in
signing up to the beta program,

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:45.260
you can follow that
url at the top.

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.110
Our beta program runs at
thousands of Android uses,

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:50.950
and we often take some of
the fantastic ideas that

00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:54.470
come out of our build weeks
and whack straight into beta.

00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:58.160
Or we also do staged
rollout MVT and A/B testing

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:00.160
in our live environment as well.

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.240
But the key point is
we're asking the teams

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:04.470
to spend one week deeply
understanding a problem

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:06.220
and coming up with the
most creative ideas

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:08.145
they can to solve
that, and the proving

00:08:08.145 --> 00:08:11.270
if their ideas work or not.

00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:12.820
[INAUDIBLE] provable?

00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:14.280
Is this provably successful?

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:16.746
Do I have concrete examples
where this has worked?

00:08:16.746 --> 00:08:18.495
It's quite telling
that when I was putting

00:08:18.495 --> 00:08:20.661
these slides together, one
of the contacts in Google

00:08:20.661 --> 00:08:23.635
kind of content and went,
shouldn't this be "probably?"

00:08:23.635 --> 00:08:25.350
And I was like, no,
no, this is provably.

00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:26.530
It's demonstrable.

00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:28.620
So what are a few
examples, just to wrap up

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:31.714
where the build weeks have
really helped "The Guardian?"

00:08:31.714 --> 00:08:33.380
Well, the first was
our hide-ads button.

00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:34.559
So if you look at
the advertisement

00:08:34.559 --> 00:08:35.767
on the right-hand side there.

00:08:35.767 --> 00:08:37.383
That's a lovely
little hide button.

00:08:37.383 --> 00:08:39.299
This grew out of our
mobile monetization week,

00:08:39.299 --> 00:08:42.890
and it drives users to our
app free premium subscription.

00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:44.990
Now when the developers
came up with this,

00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:47.210
it seems like an obvious
idea, but because

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:49.950
of completely understandable
internal debate

00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:52.240
within "The Guardian,"
we never got to the stage

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:54.490
where we were actually
rolling this feature out,

00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:57.475
because ads and subs are, in
our app, mutually incompatible,

00:08:57.475 --> 00:08:59.580
and they're two different
revenue streams.

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:01.990
Having this already built
as part of the build week

00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:03.940
allowed us to test it
really, really rapidly

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:05.315
and come to the
discussions about

00:09:05.315 --> 00:09:07.860
whether it was a good idea with
real, statistically relevant

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:09.874
data to inform the decision.

00:09:09.874 --> 00:09:12.040
As you can guess, if any
of you use the Android app,

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:15.510
that decision was to deploy
it to life, because we did,

00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:21.490
and it delivered a huge increase
in subs conversion rates.

00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:23.750
Search and profile--
it was a [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:26.150
for personalization that
all of your read history

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:28.670
wasn't available, and
one of our developers

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:31.987
build this lovely set
of profile and search.

00:09:31.987 --> 00:09:34.570
This went straight into the UX
labs, and it was loved so much,

00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:37.890
we deployed it to live
within, I think, three weeks.

00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:39.480
It's another kind
of one, for example,

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:40.922
it showed real
benefits for users

00:09:40.922 --> 00:09:43.130
who are looking to go back
over articles that they've

00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:44.870
read before.

00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:46.160
So what's coming up?

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:47.590
In our personalization
build week

00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:49.535
then one of the
developer's got together

00:09:49.535 --> 00:09:51.160
with one of our
service side developers

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:54.440
and build a new recommendation
engine, which we're probably

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:55.650
going to call Discover.

00:09:55.650 --> 00:09:57.233
This isn't live yet,
but it's probably

00:09:57.233 --> 00:09:58.390
coming out this quarter.

00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:00.600
It's the kind of investment the
business as a whole property

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.050
wouldn't have made
if it had been

00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:03.760
asked to strategically
decide what

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:05.430
it was going to do initially.

00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:07.832
But because it was
kick-started by the build week,

00:10:07.832 --> 00:10:09.540
it's allowed us to
really, really rapidly

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:11.700
take into the alpha program.

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:14.680
Similarly, Read It
To Me-- Read It To Me

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:18.810
uses text-to-speech
engine in Android

00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:21.160
to allow you to consume any
piece of "Guardian" content

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:22.590
without a screen.

00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:25.510
What's really nice is as of
the build week last week,

00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:29.580
it not only works on your
phone, but also interfaces

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:32.770
with ware, and now
interfaces with auto as well.

00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:35.071
Now this is another one where
"The Guardian" as a whole

00:10:35.071 --> 00:10:36.570
probably wouldn't
have spontaneously

00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:39.350
come up with this because we're
so concentrated on the written

00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:41.590
word, which is completely
understandable.

00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:43.640
But by putting editorial
innovation, which

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:46.839
was the them of build
week to our engineers,

00:10:46.839 --> 00:10:49.130
we came up with a feature
that we really, really hope's

00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:53.264
going to substantially
increase engagement,

00:10:53.264 --> 00:10:54.180
and it makes us happy.

00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:56.690
These are my happy team.

00:10:56.690 --> 00:11:00.232
So what's the takeaway that I'm
really suggesting to you here?

00:11:00.232 --> 00:11:02.690
Now, those of you who've run
hack weeks, they're fantastic.

00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:06.580
Those of you who run very, very
top-down development, that's

00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:08.620
sometimes required
or needed, but there

00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:09.920
is a fantastic middle ground.

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:12.820
That fantastic middle ground is
well describing in the problem

00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:15.870
and allowing your teams
to go away and engineer

00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:17.840
their solutions
and then test them.

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:19.940
So if you don't take
anything else away from this,

00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:21.565
just try that out at
least once and see

00:11:21.565 --> 00:11:24.085
what you get, because you
hopefully will be pleasantly

00:11:24.085 --> 00:11:26.520
surprised, Thanks very much.

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:31.164
