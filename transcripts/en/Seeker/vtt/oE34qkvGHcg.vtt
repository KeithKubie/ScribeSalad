00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:06.090
Getting sick and having absolutely no way
to prevent it from happening: not ideal.

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:10.900
While the medical community has made huge
strides in understanding how pathogens cause

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:16.769
disease and developing treatments to fight
against infection, detecting airborne viruses

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:21.140
and preventing them from entering our bodies
remains unreasonably difficult.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.320
And by difficult, I mean virtually impossible,
because there’s not a whole lot to protect

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:27.980
us when we breathe.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:33.550
But there's hope—and it comes in the form
of our fourth state of matter, plasma.

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.540
Engineers just demonstrated a proof of concept
plasma reactor that inactivated or removed

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:44.220
99.9% of a test virus from the air in a fraction
of a second

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:49.730
Prized for its powerful disinfecting qualities,
plasma has found applications in plenty of

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.780
industries to chemically extract particles
from the air, but using it to target viruses

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.670
is a totally novel application.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.040
Viruses are the most abundant biological entity
on Earth, and some of them, like measles and

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.500
the common cold, travel by way of sneezing,
coughing, and breathing.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.930
And do they travel.

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.990
Sneezes can launch germs up to 8 meters in
a matter of minutes, where many can remain

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.810
alive in the air for hours.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:20.220
There’s even a theory that viruses are able
to hop on the backs of dust and soil particles

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.409
and coast around the world on high-altitude
air currents.

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:28.470
The global air purifier market is projected
to reach approximately 6.2 Billion U.S. dollars

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.830
by 2023, so clearly this is a thing.

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.600
And if you have one at home, it’s probably
either one that's designed to trap particles

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.040
in a filter, or deactivate them through a
chemical reaction.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.540
All have their downfalls.

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.070
Electronic air filters like electrostatic
precipitators can be efficient for extracting

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:51.159
particles, but they don't remove gases and
smells and can produce harmful by-products.

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:55.480
Mechanical systems, like HEPA filters, can
have difficulty capturing and removing all

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.630
pollutants that enter an indoor space, especially
one that's not air-tight.

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.410
They also tend to have trouble with microorganisms
and bacteria bypassing the filter.

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:09.619
Another type of air purifier, like ozone generators,
are specifically designed to deactivate or

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:11.049
destroy pollutants.

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:16.709
But they actually just release an inorganic
molecule that’s a toxic component of smog.

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:19.060
So what makes plasma so promising?

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.819
Let’s break it down.

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:26.200
First observed by Sir William Crookes in 1879,
plasma is the fourth state of matter after

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.409
liquids, gases, and solids.

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:33.019
It's comprised of a cloud of free-flowing
ions, or electrically charged atoms, but the

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:35.209
cloud itself has no overall charge.

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:40.450
While plasma exists when molecules are heated
to extremely high temperatures, it can also

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.739
occur at room temperature if the molecules
are exposed to a strong electrical field.

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:51.090
This is known as cold plasma, aka non-thermal
plasma, and it’s the kind we want to use

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.079
if we want breathable air—I mean, normal
plasma could make things clean too, we just

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:58.379
can’t breathe air at that high a temperature.

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:02.849
Now, just to be clear, plasma is already being
explored by industries to take pollutants

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:04.430
out of our air and water.

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.499
But using plasma to rip viruses apart?

00:03:06.499 --> 00:03:11.680
That’s a whole new ball of electrons that
engineers at the University of Michigan just

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:12.819
unraveled.

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:19.430
Using a cold plasma reactor, they were able
to inactivate or remove 99.9% of a test virus

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.040
from their experimental airstream in a fraction
of a second.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.430
It works like this: as the virus flows into
the reactor pipe, a large voltage is introduced

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.739
to create an electric discharge, or spark.

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:37.290
A bed of dielectric beads sandwiched between
the electrodes maintain the spark of plasma,

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.430
whose unstable atoms oxidize the virus as
it moves through the pipe.

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.939
Upon exiting, the virus is merely a shell
of its former self—with an extremely diminished

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:48.819
capacity for infecting a host.

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:55.390
However, it’s not entirely clear how cold
plasma works to inactivate viruses: it could

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:00.129
be that the presence of the electric field
causes their shells to expand and rupture,

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:04.299
or that the fragments of the air molecules
chemically attack them.

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:06.819
But hey, it works.

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:11.420
This successful proof of concept holds a whole
lot of promise for putting the brakes on airborne

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:12.569
viruses.

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:18.129
It combines both air purification and inactivation
of airborne pathogens, making it a more effective

00:04:18.129 --> 00:04:21.349
option for disease control than the air filters
we currently have.

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:25.750
The University of Michigan team has already
begun trialing cold plasma’s effectiveness

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:30.379
at nearby livestock farms, where the risk
of animals contracting airborne viruses is

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:31.900
extremely high.

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:36.970
Because if we breathe 3,400 gallons of air
per day, it’d be great if it were virus-free.

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:37.970
And we humans breathe a lot, an average of
3,400 gallons per day.

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:40.430
Did you know that sneezes can launch germs
up to 38 yards per second?
