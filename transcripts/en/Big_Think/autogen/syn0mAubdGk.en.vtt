00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.640
didn't have this
constraints on them that they do in

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650
constraints on them that they do in
 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.770
constraints on them that they do in
Africa so you've got a bit of a problem

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:34.780
Africa so you've got a bit of a problem
 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.970
Africa so you've got a bit of a problem
you've got a massive invasive species

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:38.980
you've got a massive invasive species
 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:43.830
you've got a massive invasive species
now with most invasive species the

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840
now with most invasive species the
 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.670
now with most invasive species the
solution is to get rid of them because

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680
solution is to get rid of them because
 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.890
solution is to get rid of them because
basically they upset ecosystems and and

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900
basically they upset ecosystems and and
 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.230
basically they upset ecosystems and and
so they need to be removed but the

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240
so they need to be removed but the
 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.820
so they need to be removed but the
problem with hippos though is that they

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830
problem with hippos though is that they
 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:00.000
problem with hippos though is that they
star in Disney movies so there is this

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:00.010
star in Disney movies so there is this
 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:03.600
star in Disney movies so there is this
sort of rogue male and the first one

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610
sort of rogue male and the first one
 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.990
sort of rogue male and the first one
that they they they put down there's a

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000
that they they they put down there's a
 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.470
that they they they put down there's a
public outcry and so they had to come up

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:10.480
public outcry and so they had to come up
 

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:14.720
public outcry and so they had to come up
with a different plan and I met with the

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:14.730
with a different plan and I met with the
 

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:17.520
with a different plan and I met with the
Colombian vet who was in charge of

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:17.530
Colombian vet who was in charge of
 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:21.600
Colombian vet who was in charge of
implementing the radical plan B which

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:21.610
implementing the radical plan B which
 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:26.370
implementing the radical plan B which
was the castration program so Carlos

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:26.380
was the castration program so Carlos
 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:29.700
was the castration program so Carlos
Valderrama was given the ownerís task of

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:29.710
Valderrama was given the ownerís task of
 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:33.660
Valderrama was given the ownerís task of
having to castrate one of these rogue

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:33.670
having to castrate one of these rogue
 

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:37.140
having to castrate one of these rogue
males now this I am sure you can

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:37.150
males now this I am sure you can
 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:39.390
males now this I am sure you can
appreciate as a job that takes a fair

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:39.400
appreciate as a job that takes a fair
 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:40.740
appreciate as a job that takes a fair
amount of cojones

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:40.750
amount of cojones
 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:44.730
amount of cojones
because castrating a wild male hippo is

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:44.740
because castrating a wild male hippo is
 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:49.530
because castrating a wild male hippo is
no easy task it is actually unbelievably

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:49.540
no easy task it is actually unbelievably
 

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:50.340
no easy task it is actually unbelievably
complicated

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:50.350
complicated
 

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:53.820
complicated
first of all hippos because they've got

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:53.830
first of all hippos because they've got
 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:56.190
first of all hippos because they've got
so much fat they're really hard to

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:56.200
so much fat they're really hard to
 

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.830
so much fat they're really hard to
anesthetize because the anaesthetic

00:05:58.830 --> 00:05:58.840
anesthetize because the anaesthetic
 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:01.440
anesthetize because the anaesthetic
dissolves in the fat so even though

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:01.450
dissolves in the fat so even though
 

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:03.240
dissolves in the fat so even though
they're enormous you have to get the

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:03.250
they're enormous you have to get the
 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:05.490
they're enormous you have to get the
dosage right they also when they're

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:05.500
dosage right they also when they're
 

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:07.290
dosage right they also when they're
nervous they go into water you don't

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:07.300
nervous they go into water you don't
 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:08.940
nervous they go into water you don't
want it to pass out in the water because

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:08.950
want it to pass out in the water because
 

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:10.860
want it to pass out in the water because
it's going to drown then when you

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:10.870
it's going to drown then when you
 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:13.620
it's going to drown then when you
finally manage to anis it Carlos said to

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:13.630
finally manage to anis it Carlos said to
 

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:16.140
finally manage to anis it Carlos said to
me he had and also they're really really

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:16.150
me he had and also they're really really
 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:18.150
me he had and also they're really really
really aggressive then Carlos told me

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:18.160
really aggressive then Carlos told me
 

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:21.330
really aggressive then Carlos told me
that he had decoy Cowboys and and all

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:21.340
that he had decoy Cowboys and and all
 

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:23.730
that he had decoy Cowboys and and all
sorts of shenanigans to try and just to

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:23.740
sorts of shenanigans to try and just to
 

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:26.730
sorts of shenanigans to try and just to
get through the anaesthetic stage then

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:26.740
get through the anaesthetic stage then
 

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:28.380
get through the anaesthetic stage then
the clock was on they had a certain

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:28.390
the clock was on they had a certain
 

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:31.340
the clock was on they had a certain
amount of time in order to complete the

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:31.350
amount of time in order to complete the
 

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:32.640
amount of time in order to complete the
castration

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:32.650
castration
 

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:36.960
castration
now the thing about hippos is they are

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:36.970
now the thing about hippos is they are
 

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:39.570
now the thing about hippos is they are
the closest relative of the hippo is the

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:39.580
the closest relative of the hippo is the
 

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:43.119
the closest relative of the hippo is the
whale they have internal

00:06:43.119 --> 00:06:43.129
whale they have internal
 

00:06:43.129 --> 00:06:45.579
whale they have internal
testicles that are buried underneath

00:06:45.579 --> 00:06:45.589
testicles that are buried underneath
 

00:06:45.589 --> 00:06:48.609
testicles that are buried underneath
about eight inches of skin and fat not

00:06:48.609 --> 00:06:48.619
about eight inches of skin and fat not
 

00:06:48.619 --> 00:06:51.729
about eight inches of skin and fat not
only that but hippo testicles have a

00:06:51.729 --> 00:06:51.739
only that but hippo testicles have a
 

00:06:51.739 --> 00:06:54.459
only that but hippo testicles have a
habit of wandering about when under

00:06:54.459 --> 00:06:54.469
habit of wandering about when under
 

00:06:54.469 --> 00:06:56.559
habit of wandering about when under
threat they can move as much as eight

00:06:56.559 --> 00:06:56.569
threat they can move as much as eight
 

00:06:56.569 --> 00:06:59.679
threat they can move as much as eight
centimeters so you're looking at a blank

00:06:59.679 --> 00:06:59.689
centimeters so you're looking at a blank
 

00:06:59.689 --> 00:07:01.809
centimeters so you're looking at a blank
canvas behind which there's a moving

00:07:01.809 --> 00:07:01.819
canvas behind which there's a moving
 

00:07:01.819 --> 00:07:03.879
canvas behind which there's a moving
target now when you get in there they're

00:07:03.879 --> 00:07:03.889
target now when you get in there they're
 

00:07:03.889 --> 00:07:06.489
target now when you get in there they're
the size of cantaloupes but just getting

00:07:06.489 --> 00:07:06.499
the size of cantaloupes but just getting
 

00:07:06.499 --> 00:07:08.109
the size of cantaloupes but just getting
to them and working out where to make

00:07:08.109 --> 00:07:08.119
to them and working out where to make
 

00:07:08.119 --> 00:07:09.999
to them and working out where to make
the incision and then managing to grab

00:07:09.999 --> 00:07:10.009
the incision and then managing to grab
 

00:07:10.009 --> 00:07:12.579
the incision and then managing to grab
hold of these moving melons and getting

00:07:12.579 --> 00:07:12.589
hold of these moving melons and getting
 

00:07:12.589 --> 00:07:16.799
hold of these moving melons and getting
them out this was quite some task and

00:07:16.799 --> 00:07:16.809
them out this was quite some task and
 

00:07:16.809 --> 00:07:19.779
them out this was quite some task and
it's apparently it took him about six

00:07:19.779 --> 00:07:19.789
it's apparently it took him about six
 

00:07:19.789 --> 00:07:24.820
it's apparently it took him about six
hours and it cost well over a hundred

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:24.830
hours and it cost well over a hundred
 

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:27.459
hours and it cost well over a hundred
thousand dollars so you know I think

00:07:27.459 --> 00:07:27.469
thousand dollars so you know I think
 

00:07:27.469 --> 00:07:28.919
thousand dollars so you know I think
they've managed to do one more

00:07:28.919 --> 00:07:28.929
they've managed to do one more
 

00:07:28.929 --> 00:07:32.409
they've managed to do one more
subsequently but they're never going to

00:07:32.409 --> 00:07:32.419
subsequently but they're never going to
 

00:07:32.419 --> 00:07:35.230
subsequently but they're never going to
it's just it's too difficult they're

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:35.240
it's just it's too difficult they're
 

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:38.230
it's just it's too difficult they're
never going to be able to castrate all

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:38.240
never going to be able to castrate all
 

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:39.579
never going to be able to castrate all
the males that's just not going to

00:07:39.579 --> 00:07:39.589
the males that's just not going to
 

00:07:39.589 --> 00:07:41.769
the males that's just not going to
happen what I think is gonna happen is

00:07:41.769 --> 00:07:41.779
happen what I think is gonna happen is
 

00:07:41.779 --> 00:07:44.169
happen what I think is gonna happen is
we're gonna have a new subspecies of

00:07:44.169 --> 00:07:44.179
we're gonna have a new subspecies of
 

00:07:44.179 --> 00:07:46.059
we're gonna have a new subspecies of
Columbian hippo before too long

00:07:46.059 --> 00:07:46.069
Columbian hippo before too long
 

00:07:46.069 --> 00:07:50.079
Columbian hippo before too long
hippopotamus s cabarrus because that's

00:07:50.079 --> 00:07:50.089
hippopotamus s cabarrus because that's
 

00:07:50.089 --> 00:07:52.299
hippopotamus s cabarrus because that's
how you make a new species you take you

00:07:52.299 --> 00:07:52.309
how you make a new species you take you
 

00:07:52.309 --> 00:07:54.489
how you make a new species you take you
put it in isolation from its parent

00:07:54.489 --> 00:07:54.499
put it in isolation from its parent
 

00:07:54.499 --> 00:07:57.040
put it in isolation from its parent
species and and it evolves into a

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:57.050
species and and it evolves into a
 

00:07:57.050 --> 00:07:59.709
species and and it evolves into a
slightly different different species and

00:07:59.709 --> 00:07:59.719
slightly different different species and
 

00:07:59.719 --> 00:08:01.839
slightly different different species and
that's what's going to happen the hippo

00:08:01.839 --> 00:08:01.849
that's what's going to happen the hippo
 

00:08:01.849 --> 00:08:04.239
that's what's going to happen the hippo
is always being quoted as being Africa's

00:08:04.239 --> 00:08:04.249
is always being quoted as being Africa's
 

00:08:04.249 --> 00:08:06.459
is always being quoted as being Africa's
most dangerous animal now I I did some

00:08:06.459 --> 00:08:06.469
most dangerous animal now I I did some
 

00:08:06.469 --> 00:08:08.139
most dangerous animal now I I did some
digging around I've never really been

00:08:08.139 --> 00:08:08.149
digging around I've never really been
 

00:08:08.149 --> 00:08:10.329
digging around I've never really been
able to find out the source of this fact

00:08:10.329 --> 00:08:10.339
able to find out the source of this fact
 

00:08:10.339 --> 00:08:12.909
able to find out the source of this fact
but I can tell you having been charged

00:08:12.909 --> 00:08:12.919
but I can tell you having been charged
 

00:08:12.919 --> 00:08:16.689
but I can tell you having been charged
by a hippo myself they are really really

00:08:16.689 --> 00:08:16.699
by a hippo myself they are really really
 

00:08:16.699 --> 00:08:19.029
by a hippo myself they are really really
really dangerous I mean they they do

00:08:19.029 --> 00:08:19.039
really dangerous I mean they they do
 

00:08:19.039 --> 00:08:21.069
really dangerous I mean they they do
kill people they are extremely

00:08:21.069 --> 00:08:21.079
kill people they are extremely
 

00:08:21.079 --> 00:08:24.459
kill people they are extremely
aggressive they move really fast the the

00:08:24.459 --> 00:08:24.469
aggressive they move really fast the the
 

00:08:24.469 --> 00:08:26.230

male that we went to go and film the

00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:26.240
male that we went to go and film the
 

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:29.199
male that we went to go and film the
rogue male in Colombia he we got a

00:08:29.199 --> 00:08:29.209
rogue male in Colombia he we got a
 

00:08:29.209 --> 00:08:31.239
rogue male in Colombia he we got a
little bit too close and he was in his

00:08:31.239 --> 00:08:31.249
little bit too close and he was in his
 

00:08:31.249 --> 00:08:33.610
little bit too close and he was in his
pond and he came towards us with such

00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:33.620
pond and he came towards us with such
 

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:35.769
pond and he came towards us with such
velocity that they were barrel waves

00:08:35.769 --> 00:08:35.779
velocity that they were barrel waves
 

00:08:35.779 --> 00:08:38.649
velocity that they were barrel waves
coming off his coming off his nose he

00:08:38.649 --> 00:08:38.659
coming off his coming off his nose he
 

00:08:38.659 --> 00:08:41.769
coming off his coming off his nose he
hurtled through the water it was pretty

00:08:41.769 --> 00:08:41.779
hurtled through the water it was pretty
 

00:08:41.779 --> 00:08:44.530
