00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:22.704
For a long time I keep
the guide books out on the table

00:00:23.049 --> 00:00:27.345
in the morning, drinking coffee,
I see the spines:

00:00:28.159 --> 00:00:31.384
St. Petersburg, Vilnius, Vienna.

00:00:32.358 --> 00:00:35.347
Choices pondered but not finally taken.

00:00:36.385 --> 00:00:40.901
I'm Jane Hirshfield, I graduated 
from Princeton with the class of 1973 and

00:00:42.191 --> 00:00:47.333
I designed my own major in creative
writing and literature in translation

00:00:48.537 --> 00:00:54.118
My interest in poetry began so early.
I went to PS 40 in New York

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.195
and somewhere in there something must have
happened because by the time I left

00:00:59.571 --> 00:01:03.752
I had written on one of those large 
brown pieces of paper with blue lines:

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:06.554
I want to be a writer when I grow up.

00:01:07.121 --> 00:01:12.224
Poems became the vessel with which I 
understood my life.

00:01:12.475 --> 00:01:16.885
I understood the world and for me
it created a kind of

00:01:17.137 --> 00:01:24.006
privacy and safety, pond perhaps
in which I could craft a self

00:01:25.459 --> 00:01:31.360
I entered Princeton with the class of '74
but I was in a great hurry so

00:01:31.706 --> 00:01:36.969
I went through in three years and
graduated with the first class of women.

00:01:37.314 --> 00:01:41.891
My first year there, we had a visiting
writer teaching poetry, and that was

00:01:42.237 --> 00:01:47.314
rather surprisingly Anthony Burgess.
Mostly what I recall him saying to me

00:01:47.565 --> 00:01:52.522
was: write more, write longer, expand!
and that was very useful because

00:01:52.804 --> 00:01:56.707
my second two years I worked with the
wonderful professor Theodore Weiss.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.655
All he said to me was: cut, cut, cut!
I took a lot of courses in the

00:02:01.849 --> 00:02:05.095
East Asian Studies program.
One of the most important things

00:02:05.317 --> 00:02:09.708
that happened for me in Princeton was
Gary Snyder came to campus.

00:02:09.991 --> 00:02:14.173
What I did go to was his East Asian
Studies coffee hour presentation

00:02:14.457 --> 00:02:16.315
on the Yamabushi Mountain Monks.

00:02:16.944 --> 00:02:20.380
I think that was a quietly transformative
event for me.

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.733
When I graduated from Princeton I 
got in my, it being the 70's,

00:02:25.048 --> 00:02:30.407
a red dodge van with tie-dyed curtains
and made my way west slowly

00:02:30.693 --> 00:02:34.314
looking for where I wanted to live.
And so when I reached California

00:02:34.566 --> 00:02:38.306
I knew only that there was a Zen Monastery

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.468
in California. And so I was permitted to
go in and be what they called

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.787
a guest student for a week.
And I ended up staying for 8 years

00:02:47.417 --> 00:02:51.896
During the Monastery years, 
I wrote nothing. You weren't supposed to

00:02:52.115 --> 00:02:58.652
do anything but Zen, so I wrote one
illegal Haiku, which came upon me and

00:02:58.878 --> 00:03:02.316
wrestled me to the ground and I had to
write it so I did.

00:03:02.664 --> 00:03:07.521
Then, towards the end of my training
poetry began to return to me.

00:03:07.805 --> 00:03:14.399
I was allowed to write and very gradually
began a slow transition

00:03:14.648 --> 00:03:19.439
to living my life as a poet and
as a person of words.

00:03:19.974 --> 00:03:27.480
What I have kept and what is a through
line is the invitation to pay attention.

00:03:27.921 --> 00:03:35.003
I have always drawn my material
from what is at hand to be seen.

00:03:35.353 --> 00:03:42.635
Very often it is what is physically
in my eyes and ears,

00:03:42.887 --> 00:03:46.228
a fig that I am eating from my tree
in the garden,

00:03:46.228 --> 00:03:48.971
the mountain that I'm seeing from my
window.

00:03:49.253 --> 00:03:51.898
These have become vehicles for thinking
about

00:03:52.149 --> 00:03:56.585
both themselves and much broader issues.

00:03:57.984 --> 00:04:02.138
There is an odd moment when you 
suddenly realize you're not

00:04:02.481 --> 00:04:08.473
going to go back and ever be
a horse trainer, or a ballet dancer

00:04:08.756 --> 00:04:14.711
or any of the myriad lives which have
been open to you until a certain point

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.756
and you realize: actually the shape of my
life has been written.

00:04:19.792 --> 00:04:23.539
If you lived higher up on the mountain, 
I find myself thinking,

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:30.034
what you would see is more of everything
else, but not the mountain.
