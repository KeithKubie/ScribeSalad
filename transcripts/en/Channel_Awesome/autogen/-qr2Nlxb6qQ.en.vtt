times like five different futures that

00:11:51.319 --> 00:11:51.329
times like five different futures that
 

00:11:51.329 --> 00:11:53.030
times like five different futures that
don't connectors yeah so I like that

00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:53.040
don't connectors yeah so I like that
 

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:55.220
