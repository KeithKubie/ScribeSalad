00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:05.336
So AI has drawn up representations that help capture both divisible levels of

00:00:05.336 --> 00:00:10.390
obstruction structure for example. And the indivisible levels like behavior and

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:14.200
function. Therefore these models are sometimes called structure,

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.880
behavior, function. Let's take a simple example. All of us

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.740
are familiar with the household flashlight. You press on the button and

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.520
light comes out of the bulb. What you can see is, the button and the bulb and

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.700
the body of the flashlight. You can even open the body of the flashlight and

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.030
you might see some batteries inside your flashlight. That's all you can see.

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.240
But of course there is more going on here. To begin with,

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.170
this particular flashlight has a function. This function is invisible.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.110
You can ascribe to it, but it's nowhere inside the body of the bulb.

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.660
One level at which it is used would analyze the flashlight is, to

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:55.090
ask ourselves what does it do. Not yet, how does it work? Just what does it do,

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:59.020
its function. Here is a representation of the function. Here is the function,

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.650
create light off that light bulb circuit, or the flashlight light bulb circuit.

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.680
There is some stimulus, some external force on the switch.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.340
Initially there was no light, zero lumens and finally there is some light,

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.380
30 lumens. This captures the notion that when I press on the switch,

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.480
light comes out. Here is a presentation of the structure of the flashlight.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.890
Here is a light bulb, the switch, and the battery. And they're connected.

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.300
All of them are attached. Here is the invisible causal process that we're

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:34.120
calling behaviour. We'll capture this behavior through a series of states and

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.954
transitions between these states. So here is electricity initially in

00:01:37.954 --> 00:01:43.010
the battery. Then this electricity flows from the battery to the bulb, and

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:47.620
then the bulb converts this electricity into light. But in order for

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:51.240
this electricity to flow to the bulb, this particular switch has to be in

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.750
the mode ON. The switch goes into the mode ON, when someone presses on it.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.220
Electricity is converted to light, because that's the function of the bulb.

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.810
Notice that these SBF models are nested.

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.810
We just gave an SBF model of the flashlight circuit. But now if you want, we can

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.550
do the SBF model of the lightbulb itself. How does it create light? In this way,

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.150
structure behavior function models capture not just the visible structure, but

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.670
also the invisible cause of processes, the behaviors and

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.810
the functions. Moreoever, they capture the multiple abstraction,

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.490
at the level of the flashlight, at the level of the bulb, and so on.

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:32.250
We'll not describe it in detail here, the structure behavior function models and

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.260
other similar models enables systems thinking in the context of diagnosis and

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.000
design of complex systems. You're provided some readings about this in

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.480
the course materials, if you want to read more about it.
