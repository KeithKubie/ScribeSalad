saying it's like it it might not be the
most<00:04:22.690><c> like</c><00:04:22.930><c> mind</c><00:04:23.890><c> blowing</c><00:04:24.250><c> thing</c><00:04:24.430><c> but</c><00:04:24.580><c> even</c>

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:24.850 align:start position:0%
most like mind blowing thing but even
 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.200 align:start position:0%
most like mind blowing thing but even
just<00:04:25.060><c> that</c><00:04:25.180><c> the</c><00:04:25.390><c> smallest</c><00:04:27.210><c> interaction</c>

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 align:start position:0%
just that the smallest interaction
 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:29.340 align:start position:0%
just that the smallest interaction
design<00:04:28.420><c> that</c><00:04:28.570><c> can</c><00:04:28.630><c> just</c><00:04:28.840><c> feel</c><00:04:29.020><c> really</c><00:04:29.230><c> good</c>

design that can just feel really good
 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:32.190 align:start position:0%
design that can just feel really good
feels<00:04:30.130><c> like</c><00:04:30.280><c> 10</c><00:04:30.820><c> times</c><00:04:31.060><c> better</c><00:04:31.270><c> because</c><00:04:32.080><c> it's</c>

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:32.200 align:start position:0%
feels like 10 times better because it's
 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:33.900 align:start position:0%
feels like 10 times better because it's
in<00:04:32.320><c> VR</c><00:04:32.560><c> right</c><00:04:32.740><c> and</c><00:04:32.860><c> like</c><00:04:32.980><c> so</c><00:04:33.460><c> it's</c><00:04:33.580><c> just</c><00:04:33.700><c> really</c>

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:33.910 align:start position:0%
in VR right and like so it's just really
 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:35.850 align:start position:0%
in VR right and like so it's just really
finding<00:04:34.090><c> those</c><00:04:34.420><c> core</c><00:04:34.810><c> little</c><00:04:35.200><c> moments</c><00:04:35.830><c> that</c>

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860 align:start position:0%
finding those core little moments that
 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.310 align:start position:0%
finding those core little moments that
feel<00:04:36.010><c> really</c><00:04:36.700><c> nice</c><00:04:36.880><c> and</c><00:04:37.870><c> then</c><00:04:38.020><c> building</c>

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.320 align:start position:0%
feel really nice and then building
 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.660 align:start position:0%
feel really nice and then building
around<00:04:38.590><c> those</c><00:04:38.830><c> and</c><00:04:38.860><c> then</c><00:04:39.220><c> kind</c><00:04:39.460><c> of</c><00:04:39.520><c> like</c>

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:39.670 align:start position:0%
around those and then kind of like
 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:41.220 align:start position:0%
around those and then kind of like
sometimes<00:04:40.480><c> we</c><00:04:40.630><c> also</c><00:04:40.810><c> come</c><00:04:40.930><c> from</c><00:04:41.020><c> the</c><00:04:41.110><c> other</c>

should have this character come in from
 

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:40.440 align:start position:0%
should have this character come in from
here<00:10:39.580><c> and</c><00:10:39.640><c> they</c><00:10:39.790><c> can</c><00:10:39.940><c> go</c><00:10:40.030><c> and</c><00:10:40.060><c> make</c><00:10:40.270><c> those</c>

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:40.450 align:start position:0%
here and they can go and make those
 

00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
here and they can go and make those
changes<00:10:40.780><c> in</c><00:10:41.290><c> real</c><00:10:41.560><c> time</c><00:10:41.860><c> and</c><00:10:42.070><c> see</c><00:10:42.340><c> it</c><00:10:42.460><c> right</c>

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:42.490 align:start position:0%
changes in real time and see it right
 

00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:45.660 align:start position:0%
changes in real time and see it right
away<00:10:42.700><c> and</c><00:10:43.480><c> so</c><00:10:43.720><c> that</c><00:10:43.750><c> rapid</c><00:10:44.440><c> prototyping</c><00:10:45.100><c> is</c><00:10:45.280><c> is</c>

00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:45.670 align:start position:0%
away and so that rapid prototyping is is
 

00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:49.080 align:start position:0%
away and so that rapid prototyping is is
new<00:10:46.390><c> for</c><00:10:46.810><c> the</c><00:10:46.870><c> animation</c><00:10:47.230><c> industry</c><00:10:47.760><c> but</c><00:10:48.760><c> I</c>

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:49.090 align:start position:0%
new for the animation industry but I
 

00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:50.580 align:start position:0%
new for the animation industry but I
think<00:10:49.480><c> very</c><00:10:49.510><c> comfortable</c><00:10:50.170><c> for</c><00:10:50.350><c> the</c><00:10:50.410><c> video</c>

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:50.590 align:start position:0%
think very comfortable for the video
 

00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:53.430 align:start position:0%
think very comfortable for the video
game<00:10:50.770><c> industry</c><00:10:50.890><c> yeah</c><00:10:51.580><c> I</c><00:10:51.880><c> think</c><00:10:52.000><c> like</c><00:10:52.210><c> we</c><00:10:52.750><c> spent</c>

00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:53.440 align:start position:0%
game industry yeah I think like we spent
 

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:54.720 align:start position:0%
game industry yeah I think like we spent
a<00:10:53.500><c> lot</c><00:10:53.650><c> of</c><00:10:53.680><c> time</c><00:10:53.920><c> doing</c><00:10:54.100><c> a</c><00:10:54.220><c> lot</c><00:10:54.370><c> of</c><00:10:54.460><c> rapid</c>

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:54.730 align:start position:0%
a lot of time doing a lot of rapid
 

00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:56.370 align:start position:0%
a lot of time doing a lot of rapid
prototyping<00:10:54.790><c> like</c><00:10:55.420><c> game</c><00:10:55.630><c> jams</c><00:10:55.930><c> and</c><00:10:56.140><c> like</c><00:10:56.290><c> all</c>

00:10:56.370 --> 00:10:56.380 align:start position:0%
prototyping like game jams and like all
 

00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:57.540 align:start position:0%
prototyping like game jams and like all
that<00:10:56.470><c> kind</c><00:10:56.650><c> of</c><00:10:56.680><c> stuff</c><00:10:56.890><c> just</c><00:10:56.920><c> to</c><00:10:57.130><c> like</c><00:10:57.280><c> try</c>

00:10:57.540 --> 00:10:57.550 align:start position:0%
that kind of stuff just to like try
 

00:10:57.550 --> 00:10:59.130 align:start position:0%
that kind of stuff just to like try
ideas<00:10:57.940><c> out</c><00:10:58.180><c> really</c><00:10:58.420><c> quickly</c><00:10:58.660><c> and</c><00:10:58.900><c> kind</c><00:10:59.020><c> of</c>

00:10:59.130 --> 00:10:59.140 align:start position:0%
ideas out really quickly and kind of
 

00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:00.390 align:start position:0%
ideas out really quickly and kind of
throw<00:10:59.290><c> them</c><00:10:59.440><c> out</c><00:10:59.530><c> and</c><00:10:59.980><c> actually</c><00:11:00.250><c> like</c>

00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:00.400 align:start position:0%
throw them out and actually like
 

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:03.150 align:start position:0%
throw them out and actually like
storyboarding<00:11:01.180><c> is</c><00:11:01.300><c> kind</c><00:11:01.750><c> of</c><00:11:01.830><c> like</c><00:11:02.830><c> one</c><00:11:02.980><c> of</c><00:11:03.010><c> the</c>

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:03.160 align:start position:0%
storyboarding is kind of like one of the
 

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:04.230 align:start position:0%
storyboarding is kind of like one of the
things<00:11:03.280><c> that</c><00:11:03.430><c> we</c><00:11:03.490><c> had</c><00:11:03.580><c> a</c><00:11:03.610><c> hard</c><00:11:03.760><c> time</c><00:11:03.940><c> with</c><00:11:04.120><c> it</c>

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:04.240 align:start position:0%
things that we had a hard time with it
 

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:07.140 align:start position:0%
things that we had a hard time with it
first<00:11:04.450><c> two</c><00:11:04.720><c> is</c><00:11:04.900><c> like</c><00:11:05.580><c> just</c><00:11:06.580><c> figuring</c><00:11:06.880><c> out</c><00:11:07.000><c> how</c>

00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:07.150 align:start position:0%
first two is like just figuring out how
 

00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:08.820 align:start position:0%
first two is like just figuring out how
to<00:11:07.210><c> like</c><00:11:07.420><c> layout</c><00:11:07.630><c> the</c><00:11:07.870><c> space</c><00:11:08.050><c> I</c><00:11:08.200><c> remember</c><00:11:08.530><c> our</c>

00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:08.830 align:start position:0%
to like layout the space I remember our
 

00:11:08.830 --> 00:11:11.130 align:start position:0%
to like layout the space I remember our
artists<00:11:09.340><c> like</c><00:11:09.460><c> I</c><00:11:09.670><c> was</c><00:11:10.360><c> like</c><00:11:10.480><c> hey</c><00:11:10.660><c> we</c><00:11:10.870><c> need</c><00:11:11.020><c> like</c>

00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:11.140 align:start position:0%
artists like I was like hey we need like
 

00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:12.810 align:start position:0%
artists like I was like hey we need like
a<00:11:11.170><c> storyboard</c><00:11:11.590><c> for</c><00:11:11.740><c> this</c><00:11:11.980><c> moment</c><00:11:12.340><c> here</c><00:11:12.580><c> kind</c>

00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:12.820 align:start position:0%
a storyboard for this moment here kind
 

00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:14.700 align:start position:0%
a storyboard for this moment here kind

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:14.710 align:start position:0%
of the beats like you know figure out
 

00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:16.470 align:start position:0%
of the beats like you know figure out
what<00:11:14.800><c> you</c><00:11:14.950><c> want</c><00:11:15.130><c> this</c><00:11:15.220><c> look</c><00:11:15.400><c> like</c><00:11:15.580><c> and</c><00:11:15.880><c> he's</c>

squares and shots and camera angles I'm
 

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:24.540 align:start position:0%
squares and shots and camera angles I'm
like<00:11:20.820><c> no</c><00:11:21.820><c> like</c><00:11:22.240><c> hey</c><00:11:23.080><c> I</c><00:11:23.350><c> basically</c><00:11:23.980><c> had</c><00:11:24.280><c> to</c><00:11:24.310><c> go</c>

00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:24.550 align:start position:0%
like no like hey I basically had to go
 

00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:26.940 align:start position:0%
like no like hey I basically had to go
back<00:11:24.730><c> in</c><00:11:25.000><c> and</c><00:11:25.210><c> like</c><00:11:25.690><c> redraw</c><00:11:26.140><c> the</c><00:11:26.200><c> frames</c><00:11:26.620><c> for</c>

00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:26.950 align:start position:0%
back in and like redraw the frames for
 

00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:28.500 align:start position:0%
back in and like redraw the frames for
him<00:11:27.100><c> but</c><00:11:27.310><c> like</c><00:11:27.460><c> very</c><00:11:27.790><c> lightly</c><00:11:28.090><c> and</c><00:11:28.300><c> I</c><00:11:28.330><c> was</c><00:11:28.420><c> like</c>

00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:29.650 align:start position:0%
you know what feel free to draw outside
 

00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:31.800 align:start position:0%
you know what feel free to draw outside
this<00:11:30.100><c> you</c><00:11:30.370><c> know</c><00:11:30.460><c> think</c><00:11:30.670><c> about</c><00:11:30.850><c> how</c><00:11:31.000><c> this</c><00:11:31.210><c> whole</c>

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:31.810 align:start position:0%
this you know think about how this whole
 

00:11:31.810 --> 00:11:33.750 align:start position:0%
this you know think about how this whole
space<00:11:32.110><c> feels</c><00:11:32.530><c> and</c><00:11:32.830><c> that</c><00:11:33.190><c> really</c><00:11:33.430><c> helped</c><00:11:33.670><c> at</c>

00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
space feels and that really helped at
 

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:35.940 align:start position:0%
space feels and that really helped at
the<00:11:33.850><c> time</c><00:11:34.030><c> but</c><00:11:34.180><c> now</c><00:11:34.240><c> actually</c><00:11:34.450><c> like</c><00:11:34.950><c> seeing</c>

00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:35.950 align:start position:0%
the time but now actually like seeing
 

00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
the time but now actually like seeing
things<00:11:36.100><c> like</c><00:11:36.310><c> Google</c><00:11:36.610><c> blocks</c><00:11:36.820><c> and</c><00:11:37.240><c> like</c><00:11:37.390><c> you</c>

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:37.930 align:start position:0%
things like Google blocks and like you

that happens in if you a big expressive
characters<00:14:34.750><c> that's</c><00:14:35.649><c> fairly</c><00:14:36.009><c> easy</c><00:14:36.160><c> to</c><00:14:36.430><c> achieve</c>

00:14:36.629 --> 00:14:36.639 align:start position:0%
characters that's fairly easy to achieve
 

00:14:36.639 --> 00:14:40.680 align:start position:0%
characters that's fairly easy to achieve

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:40.690 align:start position:0%
and then obviously audio cues it's a
 

00:14:40.690 --> 00:14:41.879 align:start position:0%
and then obviously audio cues it's a

00:14:41.879 --> 00:14:41.889 align:start position:0%
little challenging with the audio
 

00:14:41.889 --> 00:14:43.620 align:start position:0%
little challenging with the audio
because<00:14:42.069><c> not</c><00:14:42.430><c> everything</c><00:14:42.699><c> works</c><00:14:43.180><c> that</c><00:14:43.480><c> well</c>

00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:43.630 align:start position:0%
because not everything works that well
 

00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:45.449 align:start position:0%
because not everything works that well
and<00:14:43.839><c> spatialized</c><00:14:44.380><c> audio</c><00:14:44.769><c> not</c><00:14:45.009><c> everybody</c><00:14:45.310><c> has</c>

00:14:48.009 --> 00:14:50.430 align:start position:0%

you<00:14:48.069><c> know</c><00:14:48.190><c> actually</c><00:14:48.399><c> mobile</c><00:14:49.269><c> or</c><00:14:49.389><c> something</c><00:14:49.720><c> so</c>

00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:50.440 align:start position:0%
you know actually mobile or something so
 

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:52.139 align:start position:0%
you know actually mobile or something so
you've<00:14:50.860><c> got</c><00:14:51.040><c> to</c><00:14:51.130><c> be</c><00:14:51.220><c> able</c><00:14:51.310><c> to</c><00:14:51.430><c> kind</c><00:14:51.610><c> of</c><00:14:51.759><c> span</c>

00:14:52.139 --> 00:14:52.149 align:start position:0%
you've got to be able to kind of span
 

00:14:52.149 --> 00:14:55.170 align:start position:0%
you've got to be able to kind of span
that<00:14:52.449><c> gap</c><00:14:52.750><c> and</c><00:14:53.019><c> I</c><00:14:53.050><c> think</c><00:14:53.550><c> just</c><00:14:54.550><c> like</c><00:14:54.759><c> in</c><00:14:54.940><c> games</c>

00:14:55.170 --> 00:14:55.180 align:start position:0%
that gap and I think just like in games
 

00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:57.509 align:start position:0%
that gap and I think just like in games
you<00:14:55.389><c> you</c><00:14:55.810><c> know</c><00:14:55.899><c> it</c><00:14:56.079><c> often</c><00:14:56.380><c> helps</c><00:14:56.529><c> to</c><00:14:56.769><c> kind</c><00:14:57.490><c> of</c>

00:14:57.509 --> 00:14:57.519 align:start position:0%
you you know it often helps to kind of
 

00:14:57.519 --> 00:14:58.730 align:start position:0%
you you know it often helps to kind of
think<00:14:57.759><c> of</c><00:14:57.819><c> the</c><00:14:57.910><c> lowest</c><00:14:58.180><c> common</c><00:14:58.360><c> denominator</c>

00:14:58.730 --> 00:14:58.740 align:start position:0%
think of the lowest common denominator
 

00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:02.189 align:start position:0%
think of the lowest common denominator
and<00:14:59.740><c> build</c><00:14:59.920><c> up</c><00:15:00.069><c> from</c><00:15:00.220><c> there</c><00:15:00.310><c> yeah</c><00:15:01.000><c> I</c><00:15:01.300><c> think</c>

00:15:02.189 --> 00:15:02.199 align:start position:0%
and build up from there yeah I think
 

00:15:02.199 --> 00:15:06.629 align:start position:0%
and build up from there yeah I think
like<00:15:02.529><c> in</c><00:15:03.899><c> actually</c><00:15:04.899><c> maybe</c><00:15:05.110><c> I</c><00:15:05.579><c> you</c><00:15:06.579><c> would</c>

00:15:06.629 --> 00:15:06.639 align:start position:0%
like in actually maybe I you would
 

00:15:06.639 --> 00:15:07.800 align:start position:0%
like in actually maybe I you would
probably<00:15:06.910><c> hate</c><00:15:07.000><c> me</c><00:15:07.029><c> for</c><00:15:07.269><c> this</c><00:15:07.360><c> but</c><00:15:07.420><c> it's</c><00:15:07.690><c> like</c>

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:07.810 align:start position:0%
probably hate me for this but it's like
 

00:15:07.810 --> 00:15:09.269 align:start position:0%
probably hate me for this but it's like
one<00:15:07.990><c> of</c><00:15:08.019><c> one</c><00:15:08.319><c> of</c><00:15:08.350><c> the</c><00:15:08.500><c> things</c><00:15:08.709><c> that</c><00:15:08.920><c> we</c><00:15:09.009><c> have</c>

00:15:09.269 --> 00:15:09.279 align:start position:0%
one of one of the things that we have
 

00:15:09.279 --> 00:15:12.300 align:start position:0%
one of one of the things that we have
like<00:15:09.670><c> have</c><00:15:10.889><c> traditionally</c><00:15:11.889><c> had</c><00:15:11.920><c> problems</c>

00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:12.310 align:start position:0%
like have traditionally had problems
 

00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:13.800 align:start position:0%
like have traditionally had problems
with<00:15:12.399><c> in</c><00:15:12.519><c> the</c><00:15:12.610><c> past</c><00:15:12.759><c> is</c><00:15:13.029><c> actually</c><00:15:13.269><c> like</c><00:15:13.630><c> our</c>

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:13.810 align:start position:0%
with in the past is actually like our
 

00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:16.079 align:start position:0%
with in the past is actually like our
character<00:15:14.230><c> interaction</c><00:15:14.800><c> moments</c><00:15:15.250><c> we've</c>

00:15:16.079 --> 00:15:16.089 align:start position:0%
character interaction moments we've
 

00:15:16.089 --> 00:15:18.269 align:start position:0%
character interaction moments we've
definitely<00:15:16.569><c> like</c><00:15:16.750><c> we</c><00:15:17.440><c> spent</c><00:15:17.649><c> a</c><00:15:17.680><c> lot</c><00:15:17.860><c> a</c><00:15:17.889><c> lot</c><00:15:18.160><c> of</c>

00:15:18.269 --> 00:15:18.279 align:start position:0%
definitely like we spent a lot a lot of
 

00:15:18.279 --> 00:15:21.150 align:start position:0%
definitely like we spent a lot a lot of
time<00:15:18.399><c> prototyping</c><00:15:19.029><c> like</c><00:15:19.889><c> interactions</c><00:15:20.889><c> and</c>

00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:21.160 align:start position:0%
time prototyping like interactions and
 

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:24.749 align:start position:0%
time prototyping like interactions and
gameplay<00:15:21.519><c> mechanics</c><00:15:21.970><c> and</c><00:15:22.290><c> we</c><00:15:23.290><c> still</c><00:15:23.759><c> very</c>

00:15:24.749 --> 00:15:24.759 align:start position:0%
gameplay mechanics and we still very
 

00:15:24.759 --> 00:15:26.730 align:start position:0%
gameplay mechanics and we still very
much<00:15:24.940><c> value</c><00:15:25.329><c> characters</c><00:15:25.899><c> and</c><00:15:26.290><c> narrative</c><00:15:26.620><c> and</c>

00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:26.740 align:start position:0%
much value characters and narrative and
 

00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
much value characters and narrative and
all<00:15:26.800><c> that</c><00:15:26.889><c> kind</c><00:15:27.040><c> of</c><00:15:27.069><c> stuff</c><00:15:27.250><c> but</c><00:15:27.370><c> like</c><00:15:27.519><c> we</c><00:15:27.730><c> do</c>

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:27.850 align:start position:0%
all that kind of stuff but like we do
 

00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:29.629 align:start position:0%
all that kind of stuff but like we do
come<00:15:28.029><c> from</c><00:15:28.149><c> a</c><00:15:28.300><c> gaming</c><00:15:28.540><c> background</c><00:15:28.959><c> and</c><00:15:29.110><c> like</c>

00:15:29.629 --> 00:15:29.639 align:start position:0%
come from a gaming background and like
 

00:15:29.639 --> 00:15:32.490 align:start position:0%
come from a gaming background and like
and<00:15:30.639><c> so</c><00:15:31.360><c> we</c><00:15:31.480><c> definitely</c><00:15:31.600><c> have</c><00:15:31.899><c> had</c><00:15:32.019><c> times</c><00:15:32.290><c> in</c>

00:15:32.490 --> 00:15:32.500 align:start position:0%
and so we definitely have had times in
 

00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:34.620 align:start position:0%
and so we definitely have had times in
some<00:15:32.620><c> of</c><00:15:32.709><c> our</c><00:15:32.740><c> products</c><00:15:33.130><c> where</c><00:15:33.339><c> like</c><00:15:33.699><c> you</c><00:15:34.509><c> know</c>

some of our products where like you know
we<00:15:34.750><c> don't</c><00:15:34.870><c> prototype</c><00:15:35.440><c> our</c><00:15:35.649><c> character</c>

00:15:36.090 --> 00:15:36.100 align:start position:0%
we don't prototype our character
 

00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:39.150 align:start position:0%
we don't prototype our character
interactions<00:15:36.670><c> early</c><00:15:37.060><c> enough</c><00:15:37.269><c> yeah</c><00:15:37.660><c> and</c><00:15:38.160><c> some</c>

00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:39.160 align:start position:0%
interactions early enough yeah and some
 

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:40.379 align:start position:0%
interactions early enough yeah and some
of<00:15:39.189><c> them</c><00:15:39.339><c> end</c><00:15:39.519><c> up</c><00:15:39.610><c> working</c><00:15:39.759><c> and</c><00:15:40.060><c> it's</c><00:15:40.180><c> great</c>

00:15:40.379 --> 00:15:40.389 align:start position:0%
of them end up working and it's great
 

00:15:40.389 --> 00:15:42.179 align:start position:0%
of them end up working and it's great
and<00:15:40.420><c> yeah</c><00:15:41.019><c> but</c><00:15:41.290><c> like</c><00:15:41.470><c> we've</c><00:15:41.769><c> we've</c><00:15:42.040><c> definitely</c>

00:15:43.650 --> 00:15:43.660 align:start position:0%
had moments where we build it out this
 

00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:44.999 align:start position:0%
had moments where we build it out this
whole<00:15:43.839><c> character</c><00:15:44.199><c> interaction</c><00:15:44.620><c> I'm</c><00:15:44.709><c> like</c><00:15:44.889><c> in</c>
