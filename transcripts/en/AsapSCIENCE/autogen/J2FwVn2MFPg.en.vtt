with a water buffalo so what are the

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290
with a water buffalo so what are the
 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.799

bestiality comes with dangers one study
shows that males who had sex with

shows that males who had sex with
 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.550

cancer than males who didn't this is

probably because micro traumas on the
