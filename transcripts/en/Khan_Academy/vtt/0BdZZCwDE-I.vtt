00:00:00.242 --> 00:00:01.782
- [Instructor] So we're
given this expression

00:00:01.782 --> 00:00:04.690
is the Taylor series about zero

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:07.675
for which of the following functions

00:00:07.675 --> 00:00:09.636
and they give us some choices here.

00:00:09.636 --> 00:00:12.218
So let's just think a
little bit about this series

00:00:12.218 --> 00:00:13.323
that they gave us.

00:00:13.323 --> 00:00:14.634
So if we were to expand it out,

00:00:14.634 --> 00:00:16.761
let's see, when n is equal to zero,

00:00:16.761 --> 00:00:18.401
it'd be negative one to the zero power

00:00:18.401 --> 00:00:21.925
which is one times x to
the zero which is one

00:00:21.925 --> 00:00:23.945
over zero factorial which is one

00:00:23.945 --> 00:00:25.612
so it'll be one plus

00:00:26.883 --> 00:00:28.599
and then when n is one,

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:30.338
well then this is going to be negative

00:00:30.338 --> 00:00:34.244
so it's going to be minus
and then x to the first

00:00:34.244 --> 00:00:36.244
over one factorial over,

00:00:37.136 --> 00:00:40.916
well, I could just write
that as x over here

00:00:40.916 --> 00:00:42.557
and then when n is two,

00:00:42.557 --> 00:00:44.679
the negative one squared,

00:00:44.679 --> 00:00:48.512
that's gonna be positive
x squared over two

00:00:49.385 --> 00:00:52.033
and there's going to
be minus x to the third

00:00:52.033 --> 00:00:54.324
over three factorial

00:00:54.324 --> 00:00:56.413
and then it's going to be
plus and I can keep going.

00:00:56.413 --> 00:00:57.804
You've seen this before.

00:00:57.804 --> 00:01:01.198
x to the fourth over four factorial

00:01:01.198 --> 00:01:02.509
and it's gonna keep going.

00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:03.892
Minus, plus.

00:01:03.892 --> 00:01:07.022
It's going to keep
alternating on and on and on.

00:01:07.022 --> 00:01:10.780
Now, our general form for
a Taylor series about zero

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.095
which we could also call a
Maclaurin series would be,

00:01:14.095 --> 00:01:17.012
our general form would be f of zero

00:01:19.292 --> 00:01:21.625
plus f prime of zero times x

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:26.486
plus f prime prime of zero

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.660
times x squared over two

00:01:32.139 --> 00:01:35.609
plus the the third derivative at zero

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:39.383
times x to the third over three factorial

00:01:39.383 --> 00:01:41.920
plus the fourth derivative,
you get the idea,

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.136
evaluated at zero times x to
the fourth over four factorial

00:01:46.136 --> 00:01:48.637
and we would just go on and on and on.

00:01:48.637 --> 00:01:50.891
Now, to figure out which function,

00:01:50.891 --> 00:01:53.873
in order what I wrote in
blue to be the Maclaurin

00:01:53.873 --> 00:01:55.555
or to be the Taylor series about zero

00:01:55.555 --> 00:01:57.518
or in order to be the Maclaurin series,

00:01:57.518 --> 00:01:58.851
that means that,

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.412
that means that f of zero
needs to be equal to one.

00:02:03.412 --> 00:02:06.069
It means that f prime of zero,

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:07.744
actually let me write this down.

00:02:07.744 --> 00:02:11.222
It means that f of zero
needs to be equal to one.

00:02:11.222 --> 00:02:13.773
f of zero is equal to one.

00:02:13.773 --> 00:02:16.190
It means that f prime of zero

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:19.592
needs to be the coefficient on the x here

00:02:19.592 --> 00:02:21.825
which is negative one

00:02:21.825 --> 00:02:22.781
and we could keep going.

00:02:22.781 --> 00:02:26.948
It means that, it means that
the second derivative at zero,

00:02:28.095 --> 00:02:29.331
well, that's going to be the coefficient

00:02:29.331 --> 00:02:31.247
on this x squared over two

00:02:31.247 --> 00:02:33.949
so that's gotta be equal to one

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:35.356
and you see the general idea

00:02:35.356 --> 00:02:39.227
that the third derivative at
zero is equal to negative one.

00:02:39.227 --> 00:02:41.910
It's the coefficient on the x to the third

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.119
over three factorial which is
negative one right over here.

00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:46.721
And so just using this information

00:02:46.721 --> 00:02:49.014
can we figure out which of these it is.

00:02:49.014 --> 00:02:51.823
So you could do a little bit
of deductive reasoning here.

00:02:51.823 --> 00:02:53.921
Let's evaluate all of
these functions at zero

00:02:53.921 --> 00:02:56.048
and see which of these are one.

00:02:56.048 --> 00:02:58.054
So sine of zero.

00:02:58.054 --> 00:02:58.953
Well, that's zero.

00:02:58.953 --> 00:03:01.127
Just by looking at this first constraint,

00:03:01.127 --> 00:03:02.474
sine of zero isn't one.

00:03:02.474 --> 00:03:03.334
We can rule that out.

00:03:03.334 --> 00:03:06.157
Cosine of zero is one so
that's still in the running.

00:03:06.157 --> 00:03:07.907
e to the zero is one.

00:03:09.274 --> 00:03:11.748
e to the zero is one

00:03:11.748 --> 00:03:15.032
and then the natural log of one plus zero,

00:03:15.032 --> 00:03:17.290
that's the natural log
of one which is a zero

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:18.754
so that's out of the running.

00:03:18.754 --> 00:03:20.032
So just from that first constraint

00:03:20.032 --> 00:03:21.503
knowing that f of zero is equal to one,

00:03:21.503 --> 00:03:24.001
we're able to rule out two of the choices

00:03:24.001 --> 00:03:26.021
then knowing that the first derivative

00:03:26.021 --> 00:03:28.661
evaluated at zero is
going to be negative one

00:03:28.661 --> 00:03:31.239
but what's the first
derivative of cosine of x?

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:33.574
Well, it's the negative sine of x.

00:03:33.574 --> 00:03:35.006
If we evaluate that at zero,

00:03:35.006 --> 00:03:36.300
we're not gonna get negative one.

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.101
We're gonna get zero so
we can rule this out.

00:03:39.101 --> 00:03:42.045
Now, the first derivative
of e to the x is e to the x.

00:03:42.045 --> 00:03:46.012
If we evaluate that at
zero, we're gonna get one,

00:03:46.012 --> 00:03:48.632
not negative one so we can rule that out.

00:03:48.632 --> 00:03:50.557
And so not even looking at anything else,

00:03:50.557 --> 00:03:53.172
we have a pretty good sense
that D is probably our answer

00:03:53.172 --> 00:03:54.369
but we could check.

00:03:54.369 --> 00:03:58.092
The first derivative
here, f prime of x here

00:03:58.092 --> 00:04:01.409
is going to be negative
e to the negative x.

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:04.242
So f prime of zero is going to be,

00:04:05.978 --> 00:04:09.797
is going to be negative e
to the zero or negative one

00:04:09.797 --> 00:04:11.104
so it meets that one

00:04:11.104 --> 00:04:13.235
and if you were curious,
you could keep going

00:04:13.235 --> 00:04:15.617
and see that it meets
all the other constraints

00:04:15.617 --> 00:04:17.703
but choice D is the only one

00:04:17.703 --> 00:04:20.082
that meets even the first two constraints

00:04:20.082 --> 00:04:24.249
for the function at zero and
the first derivative at zero.
