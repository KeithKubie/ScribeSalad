The code for this one is pretty short overall. You get the cylinder's axis, get

00:00:03.777 --> 00:00:07.205
the length from it. And then get the center by taking the average of the two

00:00:07.205 --> 00:00:10.375
point's locations. Notice that this is the one time where we actually add two

00:00:10.375 --> 00:00:13.350
points together to get the center point between them. If you're up for a

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:17.397
challenge, try this exercise again, but delete the MakeLengthAngleAxisTransform

00:00:17.397 --> 00:00:20.722
method and write it yourself. I was going to make this the assignment

00:00:20.722 --> 00:00:24.037
originally, but after taking a few hours myself fighting JavaScript and some

00:00:24.037 --> 00:00:26.209
cross product headaches, I decided against it.
