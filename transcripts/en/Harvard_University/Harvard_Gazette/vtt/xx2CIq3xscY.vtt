00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:08.370
we're now doing over conservation in
which Gryphon is shown to different

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:14.040
amounts of juice so he and tell that one
has more one has less and then we poured

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.260
these into containers that are rigged so
they have a false bottom so the smaller

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.939
quantity still looks at the same level
as the bigger quantity and now

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.470
supposedly he can't tell just by looking
at these two cups which one has more and

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.910
he's then asked to choose one of the
cups and he wants the one that has more

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.579
so if he's able to pay attention to what
I'm doing and showing him previously and

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:43.230
conserve that information about that
quantity that is higher and apply that

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.730
even though he now can no longer see
which one is higher that is evidence of

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.760
conservation and that's what we're
trying to do right now
