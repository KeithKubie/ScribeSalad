00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.550
&gt;&gt; Hi, let's just get started, so, Local Ads
in v2009. So, show hands, how many of you

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:07.550
guys using LBAs right now, and v13? So, the
only difference in the front of the room,

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:18.180
is all these. And [INDISTINCT] how it works.
All right, [INDISTINCT] you guys. I'll cover

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.460
it out in a second, but basically, I will
be going over local extensions which are the

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:30.610
new version of LBAs. They work in a fairly
different way. I thought they're more flexible

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:37.630
and they give us more flexibility to go on
[INDISTINCT] type of spot, they'll see half

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:46.000
of them. So, LBAs are going to be completely
deprecated, once the v2009 is the new standard.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.840
Local hide extensions are fully supported
in v2009. And v2009 also supports reading

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.400
of LBAs, but it does not support the creation
of new LBAs. So, what's this means is you

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:03.180
can use v2009 to reading your LBAs, translate
that [INDISTINCT] to local extension extensions.

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:11.079
But--we'd still need to use v13 in order to--actually,
sorry, using v2009, so you can change the

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:19.060
status of LBAs involved, so once you've--the
transition, then you can set them to save

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:26.770
it. If you want to create new LBAs, you still
need to use v13, but obviously, we don't recommend

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:32.560
it anymore, because if you want any V tool
it had to be v2009. Any questions about that?

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.310
Okay. So, common features. Basically, what
are the advantages of using Local Ads instead

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.520
of regular TextAds? For one thing they're
serve on Google Maps. So when somebody searches

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:50.549
for plumber, New York City on Google Maps,
LBAs or the ads that show up in the total

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.060
left panel, right at the top and at the bottom
of your [INDISTINCT] results. LBAs can also

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.509
show up as a custom icon on Google Maps, on
the map itself. So, say you're a plumber;

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:03.590
you can actually create a little icon, that's
a plunger; that sticks out on the map, instead

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:10.420
of the usual red Google Maps marker. If you're
a carpet cleaner, you could do a vacuum. If

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.830
you're a lawyer, you could do it, you know,
with scales, I think. So that kind helps you

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:24.770
standout on Google local search results. When
they're not displayed as an icon on the map,

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:30.740
they basically, look like a regular TextAd,
you can see two examples of local business

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.920
ads there. Local business ads and local ad
extension, both serve on Google search--proper

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.810
Goggle search results under the [INDISTINCT]
as well. Where they look like just regular

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.950
TextAds except with that [INDISTINCT] line
of text. If you enter a city only, it's just

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.090
shows New York, New York. If you enter an
entire street address, these shows up an entire

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:55.400
street address. So that really helps customers
recognize that you're close by to them when

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:01.640
they search for carpet cleaner, okay? So,
LBAs as you guys may know are a completely

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:07.130
separate ad type. Actually you know that better
as a key developers, and people who use the

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:11.420
AdWords [INDISTINCT], because you actually
deal with objects, but it was an entirely

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:17.000
separate type of objects. It requires a confirmed
physical location in the Local Business Center.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.870
The Local Business Center, you guys can prove
here, it doesn't have what the Local Business

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.210
Centers is. Okay, so the Local Business Center
is if you go to Google Maps, and you search

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:33.360
for a plumber, organic results, the natural
results that are not keyed are typically taken

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:40.670
from our Local Business Center database. Any
small business or even large business, anyone

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:45.890
that have a physical presence basically can
go into Google Maps, into our Local Business

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:52.840
Center section and enter their business details
including their hours of operation, upload

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.190
a picture of the--in front of their store.
Any other details about their business and

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:59.080
how that show up as a natural search result,
when somebody searches--that's not paid, they

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:04.450
don't have to pay for that, it's [INDISTINCT]
free and if you love doing businesses, go

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:09.450
ahead and do that. In order to create an LBA,
you needed to have a confirmed physical location

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:15.910
in the Local Business Center. And then we'll
link the ad into the Local Business Center.

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:19.019
There were some exemptions though, that some
partners with their trusted contact, would

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:24.289
like to create local business ads without
going through LBC. But with most part--the

00:04:24.289 --> 00:04:33.530
vast majority, anyone can learn to create
an LBA had also have a confirmed LBC location.

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:36.310
Furthermore each ad was only associated with
one street address. So, say you--one or two

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:41.460
uses the same ad copy for 12 different stores
that you own. You'd have to create 12 identical

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:47.060
ads. And then, if you have a typo on one,
you have to delete all 12 and create 12 new

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:53.610
ones. Another limitation with LBAs is that
we require that the headline of the ad, that

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.110
first line. Be identical to the business name.
And that was to keep a certain level of consistency

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:04.379
with Google Maps or organic listings. Now,
we have local extensions. Local extensions

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:10.580
are not an ad type. They're basically metadata
that you associated with a campaign or TextAd

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:17.512
that provides basically a location context,
when that TextAd is going to show. So you

00:05:17.512 --> 00:05:24.259
attach the address at the campaign level or
at the TextAd level. And when the ad serve,

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:30.039
sorry, yeah, when an ad serves, it picks up
from the campaign level by default. The location

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:35.650
that best matches, were of course the search
word. So for example, I create a one location

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:41.460
at campaign level, one address at the campaign
level. And I created a lot of TextAd. Sorry,

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:45.189
let's say, two locations at the campaign level,
one for Boston; one for New York. And then

00:05:45.189 --> 00:05:52.780
I have one TextAd to this location agnostic,
it's just, you know, it's a set of TextAd,

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:57.110
to see my products better. If somebody searches
for a plumber in New York that ad would show

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:01.400
with these fifth line of text as a New York
address. If someone for a plumber in Boston,

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:06.589
it would show the fifth line of text for Boston
address. And if somebody searches for a plumber

00:06:06.589 --> 00:06:10.379
in Oakland, that ad might still show, but
it would only show the first four lines, it

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:17.599
wouldn't show any sort of address underneath
it. And it wouldn't show on Google Maps. You

00:06:17.599 --> 00:06:21.729
can also attach an address to a single ad
just like Local Business Ad, I'll cover that

00:06:21.729 --> 00:06:25.419
in a minute. So, you can create, you can kind
of take the broader route or you can take

00:06:25.419 --> 00:06:28.300
the more specific route. And the editorial
policy is the same as TextAds. I mean, that

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:33.129
you can make the headline whatever you want.
So, you're no longer subject to that same

00:06:33.129 --> 00:06:42.580
location and having that headline have to
match with the business name. Okay, so as

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:47.401
I just hinted, you can create an extension
at the Campaign-Level or the Ad-Level. So,

00:06:47.401 --> 00:06:53.669
I'll cover the difference a little bit. All
right, so at the campaign-level. You attach

00:06:53.669 --> 00:06:59.469
one or more addresses directly to a campaign.
You can import the addresses from LBC. So,

00:06:59.469 --> 00:07:05.869
if you have an LBC account with 300, you know,
national chain stores across the country,

00:07:05.869 --> 00:07:12.719
you can import all 300 in these locations,
directly and see them in AdWords. Or you can

00:07:12.719 --> 00:07:16.930
manually upload addresses. But we do limit
you to nine manually created addresses. So

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:20.370
if you need more, you need to have them confirmed
and entered through the Local Business Center.

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:28.620
And as I mentioned, the Ads pick up the best
matching address when they serve, so Boston

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:34.240
and New York for example. All right, so those
are at campaign levels exemptions, right.

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:38.779
That does it in location or multiple locations
at the campaign-level that can be picked up

00:07:38.779 --> 00:07:49.009
by any ads. But you can also create ad on
it, you can also attach these locations specifically

00:07:49.009 --> 00:07:54.059
to one individual ad. So if you have an ad
that for example, you want to put the text

00:07:54.059 --> 00:07:59.149
Boston into it, or you want to have a promotional
that's only available for people in Boston,

00:07:59.149 --> 00:08:03.960
you would only want it, you know, show that
ad for specific location. So in this case,

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:12.330
if you basically do what we call you create
an AdOverride and that takes one of the locations

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:17.259
that's AdGroup campaign level and pairs it
with an individual ad and that ad will only

00:08:17.259 --> 00:08:22.330
show when the search is for that specific
location. So this ad will no longer just show

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:27.589
as a general TextAd. If someone searches for
a plumber in Oakland, that ad won't show,

00:08:27.589 --> 00:08:34.170
if it has a specific, you know, LocationOverwrite,
that show. So--and the AdGroup is coming from

00:08:34.170 --> 00:08:41.620
the pool of campaign extensions, and so, before
you can create an ad--an individual AdExtension,

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:53.650
you need to have that campaign extension in
your general pool. Okay. So, let's take a

00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:59.560
look at an example. So here we have a campaign
that contains a single AdGroup and two ads.

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:04.740
At the campaign level, I've created three
individual addresses: one in San Francisco,

00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:12.050
one in New York, and one in Chicago. Ad number
one has no AdOverride attached to it. And

00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:17.530
therefore, it can show for any of those three
cities or any of those three individual addresses,

00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:24.090
but then, again, if somebody searches for
Dallas or Omaha or something, it can show

00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:33.610
just as its regular four lines of text without
the address indicated. Ad number two, I have

00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:36.050
created what we call an AdOverride and I'll
cover all--go into more details and terminologies

00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:38.590
in a moment. So ad number two has one specific
address. There's address in New York City

00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:44.650
attached to it. And that means that it will
only show for people that are searching specifically

00:09:44.650 --> 00:10:00.520
in or for New York City. Any questions about
that? Okay. So, terminology. Okay. So, the

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:08.370
base class for a lot of this is what we call
an AdExtension. And an AdExtension is a very

00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:13.300
generic object that you'll see more of not
just for the LocationExtensions throughout

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:15.400
the AdWords API. And it's even a term that's
used in the AdGroup department as well. It's

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:21.710
not just the type of trend. An AdExtension
refers to any metadata that we associate with

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:26.660
an ad like a TextAd, in this case, to enhance
the way that it appears or enhance the way

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:32.990
that it in the way that it serves. A LocationExtension
is a subtype of an AdExtension where you're

00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:44.530
attaching location-specific address data to
an individual ad. LocationExtension is the

00:10:44.530 --> 00:10:50.570
important, you know, type [INDISTINCT] in
creating [INDISTINCT] or creating a local

00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:55.310
ads in each [INDISTINCT]. A CampaignAdExtension
is a pairing of one AdExtension and one campaign.

00:10:55.310 --> 00:11:00.860
So, you're basically--and again this is what
more of a generic type. It's a pairing of

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:06.610
a--in this case, you--for local ads at least
you'd be comparing a LocationExtension and

00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:16.750
a campaign. It's a relationship between the
address and the campaign with that linkage.

00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:19.940
And an AdExtensionOverride is the linkage
between an individual ad and a LocationExtension.

00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:27.880
I say here AdExtension in the bottom two bullet
points but moreover, AdExtension is just these

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:31.470
[INDISTINCT] type of the LocationExtension.
So, in these cases while you're creating local

00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:33.500
ads, you'll just be using a LocationExtension
as your AdExtension. Okay, so these are the

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:49.230
terms and the names of the classes that you'll
be focusing on when creating your local ads.

00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:58.090
Okay, so, here's not quite pseudo-code walking
through creating a new extension. So the first

00:11:58.090 --> 00:12:02.630
step, you have an address and you have the
Geocode of that address. You do that with

00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:07.601
what we call the GeoLocationService, which
is really the GeocodeService but we call it

00:12:07.601 --> 00:12:13.760
the GeoLocationService for reasons that I
don't understand but just to agree with. There's

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:19.640
a new [INDISTINCT] called a Geoworld and the
GeoLocation means something else and Geocoding

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:26.640
is actually what this is, which is just converting
an address into a lot of [INDISTINCT]. So

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:35.381
that is basically rolled up into a GeoPoint
object, the latitude and longitude for that

00:12:35.381 --> 00:12:37.340
given address. All right, so the next step
is you create that LocationExtension object

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:40.450
using the GeoPoint. Basically you're throwing
that latitude and longitude into a LocationExtension

00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:53.950
object. It represents the address as it links
to an ad or a campaign. Create the CampaignAdExtension

00:12:53.950 --> 00:13:03.440
object which, again, is the relationship between
a campaign and an address and the LocationExtension.

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:07.530
And then, you just mutate it to--or call "mutate()"
to upload it. And now you have that CampaignAdExtension

00:13:07.530 --> 00:13:15.800
at your campaign level associating the address
that you're [INDISTINCT]. So, just doing this

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:21.810
for one individual address will create that
one address of your campaign and automatically,

00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:27.030
you'll find all of the ads [INDISTINCT]. So
that's--these four steps are all you have

00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:35.100
to do so that you can add an address to all
of the ads inside your campaign. Okay, Ad-Level

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:38.080
Location Extensions are going to be easier,
because we've already created the CampaignAdExtension

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:46.450
on the previous page, which is what we'll
be using to identify the individual address.

00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:52.230
So first, use the CampaignAdExtension.get,
it's the service.get to retrieve a list of

00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:58.890
the address and you've already have AdGroup
campaign level. Then using an AdExtensionOverride

00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:03.830
objects, you create a relationship between
that CampaignAdExtension and an [INDISTINCT],

00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:11.540
and an individual ad. And there are number
of times I said extension in this presentations.

00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:20.480
I'm getting my time done. But basically the
AdExtensionOverride is the object that pairs

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:23.040
an ad and with an address here, an address
that's at the campaign level. And then you

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:31.676
call "mutate()" to upload the AdExtensionOverride
you've just created. And I know that perhaps

00:14:31.676 --> 00:14:34.950
just because of this [INDISTINCT] extension
appears here, is all just really confusing,

00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:40.250
especially on the terminology. I know, the
first I looked at it, I was, "What, what's

00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:45.770
going on?" [INDISTINCT] extension, extension,
extension, but it makes sense that you have

00:14:45.770 --> 00:14:53.420
[INDISTINCT], you know, 10 minutes, take a
look at the sample code we have. Take a look

00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:55.590
at the, you know, there's all types of [INDISTINCT]
to00and, you know, [INDISTINCT] at creating

00:14:55.590 --> 00:15:09.960
an AdGroup. It makes sense after you [INDISTINCT].
All right, Final questions? All right, thank

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:13.990
you very much, guys.
