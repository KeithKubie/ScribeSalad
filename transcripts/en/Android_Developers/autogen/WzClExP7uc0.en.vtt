in my day-to-day job I work with some of

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400
in my day-to-day job I work with some of
 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.189
in my day-to-day job I work with some of
the most successful apps and games

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199
the most successful apps and games
 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.050
the most successful apps and games
developers and I always think that

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060
developers and I always think that
 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.400
developers and I always think that
there's lots to be learned by apps

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410
there's lots to be learned by apps
 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.920
there's lots to be learned by apps
developers by looking at how successful

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930
developers by looking at how successful
 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.410
developers by looking at how successful
games developers are built what are the

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420
games developers are built what are the
 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.810
games developers are built what are the
key things that games developers care

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820
key things that games developers care
 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.670
key things that games developers care
about when they actually build their

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680
about when they actually build their
 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.880
about when they actually build their
gains for success in the next 30-40

minutes i'll try to answer that question

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750
minutes i'll try to answer that question
 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.290
minutes i'll try to answer that question
by showing you some of the key metrics

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300
by showing you some of the key metrics
 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.060
by showing you some of the key metrics
that they look at and now they go about

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070
that they look at and now they go about
 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.670
that they look at and now they go about
and optimize for them i will also try to

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680
and optimize for them i will also try to
 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.709
and optimize for them i will also try to
extrapolate some rules that you as app

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719
extrapolate some rules that you as app
 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.209
extrapolate some rules that you as app
developers can take in your day-to-day

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219
developers can take in your day-to-day
 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.580
developers can take in your day-to-day
job and hopefully use to optimize your

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590
job and hopefully use to optimize your
 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.040
job and hopefully use to optimize your
apps and also show you some examples of

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050
apps and also show you some examples of
 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.750
apps and also show you some examples of
how this learnings have been applied by

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760
how this learnings have been applied by
 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.720
how this learnings have been applied by
app developers successfully but before

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730
app developers successfully but before
 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.299
app developers successfully but before
before doing that I want to address the

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309
before doing that I want to address the
 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.599
before doing that I want to address the
elephant in the room right away apps and

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609
elephant in the room right away apps and
 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.340
elephant in the room right away apps and
games are not exactly the same actually

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350
games are not exactly the same actually
 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.950
games are not exactly the same actually
one key difference is that it's much

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960
one key difference is that it's much
 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.679
one key difference is that it's much
harder to make money on apps than it is

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689
harder to make money on apps than it is
 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.230
harder to make money on apps than it is
on games and for the purpose of this

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240
on games and for the purpose of this
 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.080
on games and for the purpose of this
talk the main difference here is that

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090
talk the main difference here is that
 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.109
talk the main difference here is that
gains enjoy much more flexibility when

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119
gains enjoy much more flexibility when
 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.749
gains enjoy much more flexibility when
it comes to monetizing that's because if

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759
it comes to monetizing that's because if
 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.880
it comes to monetizing that's because if
you think about it a game is a virtual

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890
you think about it a game is a virtual
 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.460
you think about it a game is a virtual
world where with virtual currency and

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470
world where with virtual currency and
 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.679
world where with virtual currency and
items so basically there are endless

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689
items so basically there are endless
 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.109
items so basically there are endless
possibilities in terms of what games

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119
possibilities in terms of what games
 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.550
possibilities in terms of what games
developers can put together as

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560
developers can put together as
 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.030
developers can put together as
monetization mechanics bundles and price

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040
monetization mechanics bundles and price
 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.270
monetization mechanics bundles and price
points while app developers have less

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280
points while app developers have less
 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.399
points while app developers have less
flexibility they're actually limited by

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409
flexibility they're actually limited by
 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.859
flexibility they're actually limited by
the services and the goods they are

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869
the services and the goods they are
 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.219
the services and the goods they are
trying to sell within their app and so

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229
trying to sell within their app and so
 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:45.530
trying to sell within their app and so
less flexibility less granularity but

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540
less flexibility less granularity but
 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.319
less flexibility less granularity but
there's also lots of common ground and

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:47.329
there's also lots of common ground and
 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:50.719
there's also lots of common ground and
the main key thing in common is the

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729
the main key thing in common is the
 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.550
the main key thing in common is the
business model for most apps and games

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560
business model for most apps and games
 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.990
business model for most apps and games
the business model is a freemium model

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000
the business model is a freemium model
 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.590
the business model is a freemium model
and if you share that business model the

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600
and if you share that business model the
 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.149
and if you share that business model the
equation is here on the right should

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159
equation is here on the right should
 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.039
equation is here on the right should
always be true your cost per install

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049
always be true your cost per install
 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.859
always be true your cost per install
your CPI should always be lower than the

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869
your CPI should always be lower than the
 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.810
your CPI should always be lower than the
lifetime value of the users that you

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820
lifetime value of the users that you
 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.330
lifetime value of the users that you
bring in and lifetime value is a

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340
bring in and lifetime value is a
 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.420
bring in and lifetime value is a
function of retention engagement and

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430
function of retention engagement and
 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.510
function of retention engagement and
motivation

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520
motivation
 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.690
motivation
now in a world where there is a more

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700
now in a world where there is a more
 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.730
now in a world where there is a more
competition for user acquisition and

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740
competition for user acquisition and
 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.830
competition for user acquisition and
store visibility the CPI is actually

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840
store visibility the CPI is actually
 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.420
store visibility the CPI is actually
rising for everyone for both apps and

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430
rising for everyone for both apps and
 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.100
rising for everyone for both apps and
games and that means that to make this

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110
games and that means that to make this
 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.140
games and that means that to make this
equation work you really need to focus

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150
equation work you really need to focus
 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.270
equation work you really need to focus
on the right side of it the lifetime

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280
on the right side of it the lifetime
 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.760
on the right side of it the lifetime

really it all starts with retention

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130
really it all starts with retention

account in a few test markets or to a
beta community and they really spend

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.330
beta community and they really spend
 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.140
beta community and they really spend
time tracking how this retention work

invest profitably in user acquisition
 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.250
invest profitably in user acquisition
this process is very rigorous and it

this you feel that you have some gold
 

00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:45.420
this you feel that you have some gold
you and probably are more motivated to

00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:45.430
you and probably are more motivated to
 

00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:47.100
you and probably are more motivated to
actually go to the gym and do it and

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:47.110
actually go to the gym and do it and
 

00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:49.890
actually go to the gym and do it and
actually this can be seen in the impact

00:18:49.890 --> 00:18:49.900
actually this can be seen in the impact
 

00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:52.050
actually this can be seen in the impact

after this first experience the people

00:18:59.910 --> 00:18:59.920
after this first experience the people
 

00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:01.620
after this first experience the people
were actually using the app more and

00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:01.630
were actually using the app more and
 

00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:03.330
were actually using the app more and
that's probably because they were more

00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:03.340
that's probably because they were more
 

00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:05.700

in the game they know what which steps

00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:15.870
in the game they know what which steps

segment if you don't buy then you might
become a late spender so they will

00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:24.270
become a late spender so they will
 

00:21:24.270 --> 00:21:25.970
become a late spender so they will
target later even later in the game

00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:25.980
target later even later in the game
 

00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:29.390

00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:36.050
give you an idea the first segment has
medium lifetime value but they actually

00:22:36.050 --> 00:22:36.060
medium lifetime value but they actually
 

00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:40.340
medium lifetime value but they actually
spend a lot only they spend in one go

00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:40.350
spend a lot only they spend in one go
 

00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:42.530
spend a lot only they spend in one go
and they're not very frequent buyers

00:22:42.530 --> 00:22:42.540
and they're not very frequent buyers
 

00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:45.200
and they're not very frequent buyers
they might not spend again or they will

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:45.210
they might not spend again or they will
 

00:22:45.210 --> 00:22:47.420
they might not spend again or they will
spend but a later stage not very

00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:47.430
spend but a later stage not very
 

00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:51.200

frequently the second group they spend

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:51.210
frequently the second group they spend
 

00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:53.510
frequently the second group they spend
less in a single instance but they're

00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:53.520
less in a single instance but they're
 

00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:54.860
less in a single instance but they're
more frequent they're going to spend

00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:54.870
more frequent they're going to spend
 

00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:56.150
more frequent they're going to spend
they're going to keep coming and

00:22:56.150 --> 00:22:56.160
they're going to keep coming and
 

00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:58.220
they're going to keep coming and
spending so there are their life and

00:22:58.220 --> 00:22:58.230
spending so there are their life and
 

00:22:58.230 --> 00:23:00.470
spending so there are their life and
value is higher it's just that they like

00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:00.480
value is higher it's just that they like
 

00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:02.870
value is higher it's just that they like
to spend in a different way this dude

00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:02.880
to spend in a different way this dude
 

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:05.360

segments will see different offers in

00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:05.370
segments will see different offers in
 

00:23:05.370 --> 00:23:08.150
segments will see different offers in
the game the first one will see a big

00:23:08.150 --> 00:23:08.160
the game the first one will see a big
 

00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:11.390
the game the first one will see a big
bundle with a very high price point lots

00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:11.400
bundle with a very high price point lots
 

00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:13.670
bundle with a very high price point lots
of value in it but that's the way to

00:23:13.670 --> 00:23:13.680
of value in it but that's the way to
 

00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:15.800
of value in it but that's the way to
convert this these people they're not

00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:15.810
convert this these people they're not
 

00:23:15.810 --> 00:23:19.040
convert this these people they're not
they're not scared about seeing a big

00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:19.050
they're not scared about seeing a big
 

00:23:19.050 --> 00:23:22.550
they're not scared about seeing a big
price point but they also want big more

00:23:22.550 --> 00:23:22.560
price point but they also want big more
 

00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:24.230
price point but they also want big more
value because they're not probably going

00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:24.240
value because they're not probably going
 

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:26.030
value because they're not probably going
to come back and spend later and that's

00:23:26.030 --> 00:23:26.040
to come back and spend later and that's
 

00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:28.730
to come back and spend later and that's
what you should focus on as a developer

00:23:28.730 --> 00:23:28.740
what you should focus on as a developer
 

00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:31.310
what you should focus on as a developer
now the second segment will see a much

00:23:31.310 --> 00:23:31.320
now the second segment will see a much
 

00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:34.850
now the second segment will see a much
smaller segments the bundle sorry but

00:23:34.850 --> 00:23:34.860
smaller segments the bundle sorry but
 

00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:37.580
smaller segments the bundle sorry but
and that will make them comfortable and

00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:37.590
and that will make them comfortable and
 

00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:39.920
and that will make them comfortable and
they will probably convert with that but

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:39.930
they will probably convert with that but
 

00:23:39.930 --> 00:23:41.660
they will probably convert with that but
also the developer knows that they will

00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:41.670
also the developer knows that they will
 

00:23:41.670 --> 00:23:43.790
also the developer knows that they will
probably come back and buy more so

00:23:43.790 --> 00:23:43.800
probably come back and buy more so
 

00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:45.260
probably come back and buy more so
overall their left hand value will be

00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:45.270
overall their left hand value will be
 

00:23:45.270 --> 00:23:50.000
overall their left hand value will be
higher okay let's generalize and

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:50.010
higher okay let's generalize and
 

00:23:50.010 --> 00:23:52.100

as app developers you need to recognize
 

00:23:54.930 --> 00:23:58.400
as app developers you need to recognize
that users will have a very different

a different propensity to spend

00:24:06.730 --> 00:24:06.740
a different propensity to spend
 

00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:09.549
a different propensity to spend
and also a different way to spend if you

00:24:09.549 --> 00:24:09.559
and also a different way to spend if you
 

00:24:09.559 --> 00:24:12.100
and also a different way to spend if you
can recognize that segment your user

00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:12.110
can recognize that segment your user
 

00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:15.100
can recognize that segment your user
base based on this and target them with

better conversion and revenue per user
you can use again firebase to do that

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:28.210
you can use again firebase to do that
 

00:24:28.210 --> 00:24:30.669
you can use again firebase to do that
first of all you can use firebase

00:24:30.669 --> 00:24:30.679
first of all you can use firebase
 

00:24:30.679 --> 00:24:33.490

build a high lifetime value segment that

00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:38.720
build a high lifetime value segment that
 

00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:42.010
build a high lifetime value segment that
actually has a very small price single

you these two different segments and now

00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:07.790
you these two different segments and now
 

00:25:07.790 --> 00:25:09.610
you these two different segments and now
they be aged so you can better site them

00:25:09.610 --> 00:25:09.620
they be aged so you can better site them
 

00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:11.530
they be aged so you can better site them
but now what you can do you can also

00:25:11.530 --> 00:25:11.540
but now what you can do you can also

to be bother every month they will buy
an annual subscription probably so you

00:25:43.450 --> 00:25:43.460
an annual subscription probably so you
 

00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:45.100
an annual subscription probably so you
can have a narrowly discounted annual

00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:45.110
can have a narrowly discounted annual
 

00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:47.830

and value but single price price point

00:25:53.230 --> 00:25:53.240
and value but single price price point
 

00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:55.510
and value but single price price point
lower you can have a discount on a

00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:55.520
lower you can have a discount on a
 

00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:57.970
lower you can have a discount on a
monthly subscription so the price point

00:25:57.970 --> 00:25:57.980
monthly subscription so the price point
 

00:25:57.980 --> 00:25:59.710
monthly subscription so the price point
will be lower but they're more

00:25:59.710 --> 00:25:59.720
will be lower but they're more
 

00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:01.510
will be lower but they're more
comfortable doing that and you can

00:26:01.510 --> 00:26:01.520
comfortable doing that and you can
 

00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:04.990
comfortable doing that and you can
target them with this offer again it's

00:26:04.990 --> 00:26:05.000
target them with this offer again it's
 

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.820
target them with this offer again it's

just need to go through the options and
 

00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:14.510
just need to go through the options and
it will be very easy

00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:14.520
it will be very easy
 

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:17.940
it will be very easy
this works on in-app purchases for

00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:17.950
this works on in-app purchases for
 

00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:20.820
this works on in-app purchases for
virtual goods it also works for physical

00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:20.830
virtual goods it also works for physical

virtual goods it also works for physical
goods so if you have an e-commerce app

00:26:22.230 --> 00:26:22.240
goods so if you have an e-commerce app
 

00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:24.660
goods so if you have an e-commerce app
for example this example applies to you

00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:24.670
for example this example applies to you
 

00:26:24.670 --> 00:26:26.150

this is wish a very successful
 

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:29.970
this is wish a very successful
e-commerce app and they basically show
