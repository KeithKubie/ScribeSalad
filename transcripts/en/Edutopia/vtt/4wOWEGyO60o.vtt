00:00:08.146 --> 00:00:14.366
&gt;&gt;Male Newscaster: The video was
posted on MySpace by [inaudible].

00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:16.646
This assault occurred in
North Babylon, New York.

00:00:16.646 --> 00:00:18.766
The victim apparently
just twelve years old.

00:00:18.766 --> 00:00:21.576
Her attackers are fourteen
year old ninth graders...

00:00:21.576 --> 00:00:25.446
&gt;&gt;Male caller: A student with a
gun at the [inaudible] Academy.

00:00:25.446 --> 00:00:26.746
&gt;&gt;Female 911 Operator: Okay,
where's the student at?

00:00:26.836 --> 00:00:27.466
&gt;&gt;Female Newscaster:
He was picked on,

00:00:27.466 --> 00:00:30.656
bullied and that may have
been part of what pushed him

00:00:30.656 --> 00:00:31.556
to the school shooting here.

00:00:31.556 --> 00:00:33.406
&gt;&gt;Narrator: While schools
across the country grapple

00:00:33.406 --> 00:00:35.896
with the behavior problems
of their troubled students,

00:00:36.056 --> 00:00:38.116
thousands of individuals are stepping

00:00:38.116 --> 00:00:41.516
up to help meet those students'
social and emotional needs.

00:00:41.516 --> 00:00:43.376
&gt;&gt;Michael: And no matter
what we teach your brains,

00:00:44.196 --> 00:00:46.306
love is more important
than knowledge.

00:00:47.336 --> 00:00:50.136
&gt;&gt;Narrator: One of them is
Michael Pritchard, a comedian

00:00:50.196 --> 00:00:53.806
and former probation officer
who tours the country listening

00:00:53.806 --> 00:00:55.476
to the hearts of young people.

00:00:55.926 --> 00:00:59.536
&gt;&gt;Michael: How many of you know
a boy or girl here at school

00:01:00.686 --> 00:01:03.446
who gets picked on and
left out and never included

00:01:03.446 --> 00:01:07.086
and laughed at al the time?

00:01:07.296 --> 00:01:08.456
Raise your hands high, high.

00:01:10.166 --> 00:01:13.526
Look around the room please.

00:01:13.706 --> 00:01:16.236
Hands down.

00:01:16.436 --> 00:01:19.276
&gt;&gt;Marilyn: At one point,
Michael asks kids to come forward

00:01:19.796 --> 00:01:23.766
and share how they've been hurt,
or maybe to apologize to others,

00:01:23.766 --> 00:01:27.926
and when he asks them to do that, I
thought, "They're not gonna do this.

00:01:27.926 --> 00:01:30.296
I mean, in front of all these kids,
they're not gonna come forward."

00:01:30.296 --> 00:01:35.626
I have to tell you, I was amazed at
how free they were to come forward

00:01:36.266 --> 00:01:37.916
and really share their experience.

00:01:38.126 --> 00:01:41.656
&gt;&gt;Boy: When I first moved here a year
ago, and no one really wanted to play

00:01:41.656 --> 00:01:44.256
with me, and all the fifth
graders called me names.

00:01:44.716 --> 00:01:46.216
&gt;&gt;Michael: What was it
doing to your heart?

00:01:46.636 --> 00:01:48.136
&gt;&gt;Boy: It just made
me feel really bad.

00:01:49.376 --> 00:01:52.306
&gt;&gt;Michael: We get sick if we
try to hold all that pain in.

00:01:52.846 --> 00:01:57.056
And then the unaddressed grief turns
to anger, and the anger to rage,

00:01:57.056 --> 00:01:59.646
and it has two directions,
out to the community,

00:01:59.646 --> 00:02:02.306
or inwards towards the self,
and self destructiveness.

00:02:02.966 --> 00:02:05.786
&gt;&gt;Girl: My main thing that's gotten
me through all this is empathy.

00:02:06.386 --> 00:02:11.106
When I was being bullied, I tried
to feel how they were feeling,

00:02:11.106 --> 00:02:14.956
and that's why there
were bullying me.

00:02:15.486 --> 00:02:18.386
&gt;&gt;Marilyn: Creating an environment
in which kids feel comfortable,

00:02:18.386 --> 00:02:19.626
in which they are productive,

00:02:19.626 --> 00:02:24.126
in which they treated one another
well, is not a one shot thing.

00:02:24.376 --> 00:02:27.986
So our responsibility as
adults that work with kids is

00:02:27.986 --> 00:02:29.446
to reiterate that lesson.

00:02:29.556 --> 00:02:32.116
And in my experience, it
takes three to five years

00:02:32.116 --> 00:02:35.826
to really change a school culture
and it's a learning process.

00:02:35.906 --> 00:02:37.186
&gt;&gt;Teacher: What people say to us

00:02:37.306 --> 00:02:40.296
and how other people treat us kinda
shapes what we think about ourselves.

00:02:40.986 --> 00:02:42.746
And I wanna share with you a story.

00:02:43.086 --> 00:02:44.586
One day, Maria woke up--

00:02:44.766 --> 00:02:46.706
&gt;&gt;Narrator: With curriculum
material from programs

00:02:46.706 --> 00:02:49.206
like Resolving Conflict Creatively,

00:02:49.206 --> 00:02:52.956
students can learn social
emotional skills in any classroom.

00:02:52.956 --> 00:02:55.256
&gt;&gt;Teacher: And so her sister
came into the room and said,

00:02:55.726 --> 00:02:57.476
"Are you gonna wear those
old rags to school?"

00:03:00.076 --> 00:03:03.616
&gt;&gt;Linda: We are talking about a whole
new vision of education that says

00:03:03.696 --> 00:03:07.386
that educating the heart is as
important as educating the mind.

00:03:07.386 --> 00:03:10.436
And so it's about equipping
young people with the kinds

00:03:10.436 --> 00:03:14.626
of skills they need to both
identify and manage their emotions,

00:03:15.276 --> 00:03:17.686
to communicate those
emotions effectively

00:03:18.226 --> 00:03:20.966
and to resolve conflict
non violently.

00:03:21.256 --> 00:03:22.996
&gt;&gt;Teacher: So that was Maria's day.

00:03:23.456 --> 00:03:26.796
How do you think Maria's feeling now,
if this is what's left of her heart?

00:03:27.146 --> 00:03:28.356
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Emotional intelligence,

00:03:28.356 --> 00:03:32.376
which refers to how you handle your
own feelings, how well you empathize

00:03:32.376 --> 00:03:36.486
and get along with other people
is just a key human skill

00:03:36.536 --> 00:03:39.876
but it also turns out that
kids who are better able

00:03:40.116 --> 00:03:41.646
to manage their emotions,
for example,

00:03:41.646 --> 00:03:43.056
actually can pay attention better,

00:03:43.386 --> 00:03:46.426
can take in information
better, can remember better.

00:03:46.426 --> 00:03:48.026
In other words, it
helps you learn better.

00:03:48.466 --> 00:03:51.636
&gt;&gt;Student: Let's say if me
and Gabriela had a problem,

00:03:52.086 --> 00:03:56.256
then we're gonna go inside the peace
corner and express our feelings

00:03:56.256 --> 00:04:01.146
with a peace helper, and I think
everybody knows what a peace

00:04:01.316 --> 00:04:02.856
helper is.

00:04:02.856 --> 00:04:05.486
&gt;&gt;Narrator: At PS twenty-four
in Brooklyn, students learn

00:04:05.486 --> 00:04:08.356
to take an active role in
solving classroom disputes.

00:04:08.866 --> 00:04:11.646
&gt;&gt;Student: So you had a book first,
and a girl snatched it from you?

00:04:11.806 --> 00:04:11.956
&gt;&gt;Yeah.

00:04:12.786 --> 00:04:14.236
&gt;&gt;How do you feel?

00:04:14.506 --> 00:04:15.226
&gt;&gt;I feel mad.

00:04:15.366 --> 00:04:18.546
&gt;&gt;Alexus: I like doing it,
'cause I like helping other kids

00:04:18.546 --> 00:04:22.256
and it's very fun for me
because I get to have fun

00:04:22.306 --> 00:04:25.956
and then be serious at the same time.

00:04:26.476 --> 00:04:28.316
&gt;&gt;Do you need my help?

00:04:28.786 --> 00:04:28.896
&gt;&gt;Yeah.

00:04:29.576 --> 00:04:31.296
&gt;&gt;What happened?

00:04:31.476 --> 00:04:36.216
&gt;&gt;Alexus: When I do stuff like the
mini lesson, I have to stay focused,

00:04:36.576 --> 00:04:39.696
and especially when I'm
working like with first graders

00:04:39.696 --> 00:04:40.446
or kindergarten [inaudible].

00:04:40.446 --> 00:04:44.286
&gt;&gt;When the peace helpers were
helping solve the conflict,

00:04:44.816 --> 00:04:46.616
what did you see the
peace helpers do?

00:04:48.406 --> 00:04:52.936
&gt;&gt;I'm still learning, because if
I go into sixth grade next year,

00:04:53.226 --> 00:04:55.346
I need to learn how
to control my anger,

00:04:56.416 --> 00:04:58.886
'cause I have a serious
temper problem.

00:05:00.416 --> 00:05:03.226
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Running game or having
game is pressuring somebody,

00:05:03.376 --> 00:05:05.376
'cause you trying to
slick 'em, right?

00:05:05.516 --> 00:05:07.996
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In nineteen
ninety, New Haven,

00:05:07.996 --> 00:05:11.496
Connecticut pioneered a
comprehensive, district wide approach

00:05:11.696 --> 00:05:14.016
to teaching social emotional skills.

00:05:14.016 --> 00:05:16.166
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Focus in on
your dot, nothing else.

00:05:16.346 --> 00:05:17.026
Deep breaths.

00:05:17.206 --> 00:05:18.716
&gt;&gt;Karol: In our middle
schools and high schools,

00:05:18.716 --> 00:05:21.566
the social development curriculum
is taught as a separate class.

00:05:21.566 --> 00:05:23.386
A student might go to
English first period

00:05:23.386 --> 00:05:26.266
and social development second
period and chemistry third period.

00:05:26.556 --> 00:05:29.316
So the student is taking the
skills that he or she is learning

00:05:29.316 --> 00:05:31.836
in that second period
social development class

00:05:31.836 --> 00:05:35.226
and using those skills wherever
else in his or her life is needed.

00:05:35.336 --> 00:05:38.596
&gt;&gt;Teacher: One possible solution
is saying no or walking away.

00:05:39.176 --> 00:05:39.736
Is that real?

00:05:40.066 --> 00:05:42.476
&gt;&gt;Karol: Just like you take the
reading skills that you learn

00:05:42.476 --> 00:05:45.216
in fourth period class and
apply them throughout your life,

00:05:45.256 --> 00:05:46.746
it doesn't matter if other people

00:05:46.746 --> 00:05:48.366
in your life have the same
reading skills or not.

00:05:48.486 --> 00:05:52.036
You have the skills.

00:05:52.106 --> 00:05:55.726
&gt;&gt;If you've been hurt by someone
saying or doing something mean

00:05:55.726 --> 00:05:56.916
or thoughtless, move into the circle.

00:05:56.916 --> 00:05:57.616
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The success

00:05:57.616 --> 00:06:01.866
of New Haven's efforts inspired other
districts, like Anchorage, Alaska,

00:06:01.866 --> 00:06:04.256
to take on ambitious programs.

00:06:04.256 --> 00:06:04.676
&gt;&gt;Falling.

00:06:05.086 --> 00:06:05.586
&gt;&gt;Fall away.

00:06:05.836 --> 00:06:11.976
&gt;&gt;Narrator: This daylong series
of games, trust exercises

00:06:12.016 --> 00:06:15.356
and truth telling sessions,
called a Change of Heart,

00:06:15.426 --> 00:06:18.896
is designed to forge a caring
community from the diverse group

00:06:18.896 --> 00:06:23.006
of twenty-four hundred students and
staff at East Anchorage High School.

00:06:23.186 --> 00:06:24.586
&gt;&gt;Yes, I trust you guys.

00:06:24.586 --> 00:06:25.096
&gt;&gt;What's your name?

00:06:25.096 --> 00:06:26.966
&gt;&gt;Narrator: It's just
part of a concerted effort

00:06:26.966 --> 00:06:30.206
to address the social and
emotional needs of every student

00:06:30.206 --> 00:06:33.586
in the district, an effort
that began with schools

00:06:33.586 --> 00:06:36.576
in turmoil just a few years ago.

00:06:36.576 --> 00:06:38.476
&gt;&gt;Alivia: You know, you hear those
horror stories about like, you know,

00:06:38.476 --> 00:06:40.756
like thugs showing up at
school, like you having

00:06:40.876 --> 00:06:44.986
to look behind your shoulder,
and that's how it was.

00:06:44.986 --> 00:06:46.306
There was a lockdown at lunch.

00:06:46.456 --> 00:06:48.776
&gt;&gt;Carol: Alaska, unfortunately,
has the highest rate

00:06:48.776 --> 00:06:51.636
of domestic violence,
sexual and child abuse,

00:06:51.636 --> 00:06:53.186
in the nation per capita.

00:06:53.186 --> 00:06:57.106
And so a lot of our kids, they're
watching violence in their homes.

00:06:57.106 --> 00:06:59.356
Sometimes they're the ones
being attacked and abused,

00:06:59.866 --> 00:07:02.856
and for them to be able to come
into school, which is frankly,

00:07:02.856 --> 00:07:06.776
for many of them, their safe haven,
and to automatically switch that off

00:07:06.836 --> 00:07:08.976
and say, "Oh yes, I'm
gonna really focus

00:07:08.976 --> 00:07:11.446
on algebra," it isn't even realistic.

00:07:11.846 --> 00:07:15.916
And so we've got a lot of young
people in very great distress.

00:07:16.466 --> 00:07:19.336
&gt;&gt;Narrator: After nearly a
decade of studying best practices

00:07:19.336 --> 00:07:23.186
from around the country, the
district adopted comprehensive social

00:07:23.286 --> 00:07:26.646
and emotional standards,
with concrete benchmarks

00:07:26.686 --> 00:07:29.736
for appropriate behavior
at every grade level.

00:07:30.206 --> 00:07:33.246
They designed classes
to teach specific skills

00:07:33.496 --> 00:07:35.806
and developed guidelines
for assessment.

00:07:35.806 --> 00:07:37.776
&gt;&gt;Vickie: I'm a curriculum
coordinator,

00:07:38.216 --> 00:07:40.806
so I am seen in the same office

00:07:40.806 --> 00:07:42.626
as the language arts
coordinator the math coordinator,

00:07:42.626 --> 00:07:46.086
the health coordinator, et cetera
to show just visually, politically,

00:07:46.086 --> 00:07:47.816
everything else, that
we are gonna value this

00:07:47.866 --> 00:07:49.536
like we value any of
our other curricula.

00:07:49.536 --> 00:07:54.086
A lot of my job is to look at the
already adopted curriculum and say,

00:07:54.086 --> 00:07:57.546
"Okay, here's a place where, if I
was teaching this reading lesson,

00:07:57.546 --> 00:07:59.736
I could also hit this social
emotional learning center

00:07:59.736 --> 00:08:00.586
at the same time."

00:08:01.086 --> 00:08:02.646
&gt;&gt;Teacher: "Two roads
diverged in a wood

00:08:02.646 --> 00:08:05.006
and I took the one less traveled by,

00:08:05.066 --> 00:08:06.816
and that has made all
the difference."

00:08:06.816 --> 00:08:08.326
What do you think he's saying there?

00:08:08.546 --> 00:08:12.896
&gt;&gt;Student: I think that he took the
one that not everybody was doing,

00:08:13.076 --> 00:08:16.956
like maybe everybody was doing
a different thing and he thought

00:08:16.956 --> 00:08:19.426
that it was wrong, so he did the
other thing, and maybe he was right?

00:08:20.196 --> 00:08:22.816
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Doesn't even
have to be right or wrong.

00:08:22.816 --> 00:08:25.106
Just follow your heart,
be true to yourself.

00:08:25.186 --> 00:08:28.506
&gt;&gt;Student: So Mike has eight dollars.

00:08:28.576 --> 00:08:29.086
Is this Mike?

00:08:29.086 --> 00:08:31.286
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In this
fifth grade math glass,

00:08:31.886 --> 00:08:34.296
solving problems is
a social activity.

00:08:34.296 --> 00:08:35.596
&gt;&gt;Student: Mike started with eight.

00:08:35.706 --> 00:08:40.586
Kelly had twice as much
as Mike, and Joe had half

00:08:40.586 --> 00:08:41.856
as much as Kelly, which is--

00:08:41.856 --> 00:08:44.256
&gt;&gt;Chris: Every teacher out there has
probably said at some point in time,

00:08:44.256 --> 00:08:45.876
"Turn to your neighbor
and talk about this idea.

00:08:46.236 --> 00:08:48.116
Look at your teammates
and talk about this idea."

00:08:48.446 --> 00:08:49.986
&gt;&gt;Student: Why did you
do those shapes there?

00:08:50.396 --> 00:08:53.516
&gt;&gt;Student: 'Cause it looked cool.

00:08:54.406 --> 00:08:57.816
&gt;&gt;Chris: And really watch if
they are talking about the topic

00:08:57.896 --> 00:09:00.816
that you've asked them to talk
about, if they're actually listening

00:09:00.816 --> 00:09:03.746
to each other, and using that
language and those social skills.

00:09:03.836 --> 00:09:05.716
Then all of a sudden,
you have an environment

00:09:05.926 --> 00:09:09.266
where thirty kids are all
learning at the same time.

00:09:09.266 --> 00:09:13.006
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Today Lucia intentionally
bumps into Jackson in the lunch room

00:09:13.006 --> 00:09:14.756
and makes him spill his food.

00:09:14.976 --> 00:09:19.586
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The aggressors, victims
and bystanders, or AVB curriculum,

00:09:19.586 --> 00:09:23.106
has been adopted by all of the
middle schools in the district.

00:09:23.346 --> 00:09:27.546
&gt;&gt;Teacher: What are some of the
cool headed thoughts he could have?

00:09:28.066 --> 00:09:30.226
&gt;&gt;Student: He might
think that she likes him

00:09:30.596 --> 00:09:32.916
and that's why she's
being so mean to him.

00:09:32.916 --> 00:09:33.396
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Exactly.

00:09:33.396 --> 00:09:35.826
I hate to say it, but
sometimes at middle school,

00:09:35.886 --> 00:09:38.456
kids do some really weird
things to the kids they like.

00:09:38.896 --> 00:09:41.886
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Today you're going
to be interviewing one person,

00:09:41.886 --> 00:09:45.926
and that one person is also
going to be interviewing you.

00:09:46.316 --> 00:09:49.566
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Freshman English teacher
Trudy Keller incorporates social

00:09:49.566 --> 00:09:52.216
emotional learning standards
in her daily lessons.

00:09:52.756 --> 00:09:55.386
&gt;&gt;Trudy: "Scrutinize" is a word
that'll be on your next quiz.

00:09:55.386 --> 00:09:58.016
I want you to really
scrutinize them and think

00:09:58.016 --> 00:10:01.856
about your impressions
beyond just what they say.

00:10:02.676 --> 00:10:06.676
&gt;&gt;One of the students wrote about
his partner that he interviewed

00:10:06.886 --> 00:10:11.196
because this student's
parent was a drug addict,

00:10:11.656 --> 00:10:15.736
and actually caused a great
deal of turmoil in the family,

00:10:16.306 --> 00:10:20.336
and was actually a student
that he had sort of looked

00:10:20.336 --> 00:10:21.776
down on, I think, before.

00:10:22.166 --> 00:10:24.396
And then he wrote, "I have
a great deal of respect

00:10:24.706 --> 00:10:26.966
for what this student
has been through."

00:10:27.456 --> 00:10:31.496
&gt;&gt;Student: Do you have a
job or what's your home-- ?

00:10:31.676 --> 00:10:33.756
&gt;&gt;Student: Well, I
have a disabled brother

00:10:33.756 --> 00:10:35.866
and I usually take
care of him and stuff.

00:10:36.016 --> 00:10:38.936
&gt;&gt;Trudy: I just think that
you need to be in touch

00:10:39.006 --> 00:10:41.206
with their feelings, their emotions.

00:10:41.656 --> 00:10:45.326
When I know what's going on, and I
acknowledge that and we deal with it,

00:10:45.626 --> 00:10:48.346
then we can get on to
the job of learning.

00:10:48.526 --> 00:10:49.736
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Two, three.

00:10:50.016 --> 00:10:53.186
&gt;&gt;All: [singing] The world is
full of all kinds of people.

00:10:53.316 --> 00:10:56.966
Inside our blood flows the same.

00:10:56.966 --> 00:10:59.366
&gt;&gt;Michael: We're all under the
gun to improve our test results,

00:10:59.446 --> 00:11:03.066
the academics, but I'll tell you
what, it's a whole lot more fun

00:11:03.776 --> 00:11:06.656
to start focusing on
that connection with kids

00:11:06.656 --> 00:11:08.886
and helping people feel
good about where they are.

00:11:09.206 --> 00:11:09.866
The other will follow.

00:11:10.266 --> 00:11:12.356
Our teachers, I think,
are much happier.

00:11:12.626 --> 00:11:13.346
They like their kids.

00:11:13.526 --> 00:11:14.926
&gt;&gt;Pat: Good job, kiddo, excellent.

00:11:15.336 --> 00:11:18.426
Practice being cool
headed this weekend.

00:11:18.486 --> 00:11:21.706
&gt;&gt;Corey: Since my freshman
year, the amount of suspensions

00:11:21.706 --> 00:11:24.616
that have happened at East
has gone down dramatically.

00:11:24.716 --> 00:11:27.656
The amount of fights has
gone down dramatically.

00:11:27.976 --> 00:11:31.436
East as a whole, it's so
much better than before.

00:11:31.436 --> 00:11:34.886
&gt;&gt;The goal is to hit the ball
in the air as many times--

00:11:34.966 --> 00:11:38.526
&gt;&gt;Vickie: The advantage of spending
time doing this is the payoff

00:11:38.596 --> 00:11:39.286
in academics.

00:11:39.616 --> 00:11:43.036
There's research out now
that shows that kids involved

00:11:43.106 --> 00:11:45.356
in intentional social emotional
learning programs like we're trying

00:11:45.356 --> 00:11:47.906
to do right here scored on
average ten percent higher

00:11:47.906 --> 00:11:49.196
on their standardized tests.

00:11:49.716 --> 00:11:51.316
So what are we giving up?

00:11:51.756 --> 00:11:53.946
We're giving up, you
know, higher referrals.

00:11:54.096 --> 00:11:55.766
We're giving up violence
in our schools.

00:11:56.066 --> 00:11:56.856
What are we getting?

00:11:57.196 --> 00:11:59.086
Kids who come to school because
they wanna come to school,

00:11:59.616 --> 00:12:02.056
and kids who know how to act
when they get into the schools,

00:12:02.206 --> 00:12:04.846
and hopefully, kids who
will go into their futures

00:12:04.846 --> 00:12:06.906
with a better chance at success.

00:12:07.026 --> 00:12:08.606
&gt;&gt;Michael: How should
we treat each other?

00:12:08.606 --> 00:12:12.436
&gt;&gt;Boy: Very well, because if
we treat each other really bad,

00:12:12.436 --> 00:12:16.296
we won't like get along
or be friends,

00:12:16.296 --> 00:12:20.396
or like be part of one big family.

00:12:20.626 --> 00:12:28.706
&gt;&gt;Michael: You know what, you go home
and you tell your mom-- look at me.

00:12:28.916 --> 00:12:29.286
You have [speaking Spanish.]

00:12:29.286 --> 00:12:29.353
&gt;&gt;Boy: [speaking Spanish].

00:12:29.353 --> 00:12:31.236
&gt;&gt;Michael: I love you.

00:12:31.236 --> 00:12:31.966
All right, [speaking Spanish].

00:12:32.386 --> 00:12:34.306
