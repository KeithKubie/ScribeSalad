00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:05.880
JIM: I've invited a friend
of mine, Brendan Murphy, who

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.860
we happened to meet
by chance encounter

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.300
on a boat ride in the Caribbean.

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.980
And a conversation has
now led to a friendship.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.840
And he was nice enough
to accept an invitation

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.260
to come speak to
you today at Google.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.740
So I want to tell you a
little bit about Brendan.

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.820
He's a former professional
athlete who's now an artist.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.290
So he's going to tell you a
little bit about his journey

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:30.970
and how that came about.

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:36.310
He's currently in over
500 collections worldwide.

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:39.160
He started and sold an
athletic company called Solfire

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.610
that some of you may
have seen or heard about.

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.070
And he most recently
launched a brand new venture

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.490
called 143 The Love Exchange.

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:50.890
I've always wanted to say that.

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.050
I finally got a
chance to say that.

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:54.720
But today, he's
going to take you

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.470
on an artistic
journey of discovery

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.650
and following one's
intuition-- both the art of it,

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:02.340
and the science of it.

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.610
So it's going to be an
interactive session.

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.600
And we hope you will
participate as much as possible.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.140
So without further ado, I want
to introduce Brendan Murphy--

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.470
today's Google Talk speaker.

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.950
BRENDAN MURPHY: Thank you, Jim.

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.380
Happy St Patrick's Day.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.910
I brought my own audience just
in case nobody claps or laughs.

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.657
So I suggest you
do that whenever

00:01:27.657 --> 00:01:28.740
you have to give a speech.

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.900
I met Jim as he said--
he already left.

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.190
Jim and I-- we met
on a little boat

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.210
ride coming from Richard
Branson's island.

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.930
Jim left that part out.

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.060
We were at a charity function.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.530
He's been a
fantastic new friend,

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.890
and a lot of our discussions
have been about potential,

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.580
reaching potential.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:04.390
And in my field-- I'm a
creative person and an artist,

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.580
and we thought it might
be interesting to share

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.530
some of my process.

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.686
And hopefully it translates
to some of what you guys do.

00:02:14.686 --> 00:02:16.060
So I wanted to
give an overview--

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.740
I don't know if
you saw the title.

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.760
But the title of my speech
was Patterns, Progression

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.870
and Ideal Creative Output.

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:33.910
And I'm going to touch
on all three of those.

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.130
Before I get into
my story and so on,

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:38.505
I want to just
touch on patterns.

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.530
Patterns can be detrimental,
and can be very effective.

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.940
We all have patterns
in our lives,

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.510
whether it's relationships,
whether it's work.

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:58.120
And I think it's important to
realize what our patterns are,

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.620
and it's also important
to try and expand and get

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:02.750
beyond those patterns.

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.000
So I'm going to touch on that.

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:07.290
I

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.370
You see a canvas up here.

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:14.100
One of my new series of works
is called the Chalkboard Series.

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.360
So I'm going to try,
while I give the speech,

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.820
to do a painting.

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.350
My version of a
chalkboard painting.

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.080
It's kind of odd
because I may have

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.490
to turn my back on
you a little bit,

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:29.070
and I've never actually done
a painting for an audience.

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:36.570
So no promises, but my hope
is to somehow include you

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:39.740
in the process of
creating-- in my process.

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:41.080
I don't know if we can do it.

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.250
We'll try, and it may
even be some interaction.

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:49.610
And I'll explain this
painting and so forth.

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:50.900
I have some notes here.

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.400
I can tell you right
now this is not

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.050
going to be formal, as
you can already tell.

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:59.810
I really want to just share
my experiences and my process

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.570
and hope, again
as I said, I hope

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:07.580
it translates, and helps you get
to this ideal creative output.

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:12.090
I don't know exactly
what you guys do here.

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.070
I can imagine you're
all smarter than me.

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:17.140
We'll will start there.

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.670
At the same time, I
think the differentiator

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:26.390
in all types of
occupations or skill sets

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:30.640
is that little extra
instinct creativity.

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:31.580
That's the difference.

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.490
That's probably why
you guys are here,

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:35.580
and not working
for a competitor.

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.300
That's probably why
Google has succeeded,

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.490
because everyone in this
room or in this building

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:44.550
has just another level
of differentiation.

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:45.870
And that comes from within.

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.560
And that's what we're after--
ideal creative output.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.950
And how do you
get to that state?

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:54.810
So bear with me if I kind of
bounce around a little bit.

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.430
Before I get into, again, my
story, ideal creative output

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:04.800
is in sports.

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.660
As I played professional
basketball--

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:10.790
if what we call the zone-- it's
this place where you get to.

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:12.970
And you don't know
how you get there,

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:14.730
and you don't know
how to get back to it.

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:17.570
But when you're
there, it's awesome.

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:22.110
And in the creative world, when
I knock out a great painting--

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:23.730
there comes to a
point in the painting

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:26.374
where it can go either way.

00:05:26.374 --> 00:05:27.790
I can lose the
training or it'd be

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:29.670
the best painting
I've ever done.

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:32.500
And right in that spot--
right in that sweet spot.

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:39.350
It's comparable on some
level to an orgasm.

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:45.740
And as we all know, you can
never have enough of those.

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:48.660
Unfortunately, it's
not that easy to get to

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:49.710
on a daily basis.

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:52.940
So I'd like to try
and tell you kind

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:57.930
of how it is that-- there's
certain things we can do

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:00.110
to get us to that
state, I think.

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:03.660
And the sports where everyone--
I know a ton of scientists.

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:05.730
We have one of them
here in the front row.

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:08.710
And they spend every day trying
to get athletes-- figuring out

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:09.210
a way.

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:12.150
How do we get these
athletes into this zone?

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:17.980
Well, I'm just applying that
to the creative process.

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:18.700
All right.

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:20.800
The easiest part of my
speech is talk about me.

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:24.660
I was a professional athlete.

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:25.640
I played basketball.

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:28.700
I was a little too short to
make the NBA, but I did well.

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:30.500
I played in Europe.

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:31.930
I grew up in Rhode Island.

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:34.870
I'm half Irish and half Italian.

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:39.490
I played in Hawaii,
and from there, I

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:42.410
played professional
basketball in Germany.

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:43.700
It didn't last that long.

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:45.210
I probably played six years.

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:47.580
My claim to fame is I
brought Dirk Nowitzki

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:48.610
to the United States.

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:51.600
I was the guy who
discovered Dirk.

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:52.540
I moved to New York.

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:53.720
I worked on Wall Street.

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.080
I was a trader.

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:56.930
I had no idea what I was doing.

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:00.570
I made a lot of money and
I lost it just as quick.

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:03.510
And in that process, I
was painting as a hobby.

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:08.450
And I realized that I wasn't
like anybody in Wall Street

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:10.510
and it wasn't my thing.

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:13.710
But I love painting,
and I love creating.

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:17.350
And in the process of going
broke, I painted a lot more.

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:21.810
And it kept me somewhat
sane, kept me out of trouble,

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:23.090
and I did a show.

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:25.150
And I sold a bunch of paintings.

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:28.410
And I think most of my friends
were feeling bad for me,

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:29.980
but I didn't care.

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:33.910
I said, well, I'll keep
painting until I figure out

00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:37.387
what to do next, and
that was 14 years ago.

00:07:37.387 --> 00:07:39.220
I still haven't figured
out what to do next.

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:40.011
I'm still painting.

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:48.510
In the process-- that
creative journey--

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:50.440
I somehow ended up in
the clothing business.

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:55.130
My designs were being used for
athletic clothing brand, which

00:07:55.130 --> 00:08:01.640
took me four years, which I
just sold a couple months ago.

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:05.510
So that was an
interesting journey.

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:08.440
The art and the creativity
really drives my bus

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:10.630
and I bet you a lot
of people in this room

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:14.010
could say the same thing.

00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:15.820
And now I'm here.

00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:17.230
I'm here at Google.

00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:19.030
And it's been an
amazing journey.

00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:20.510
It continues.

00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:26.730
And again, I kind of
want to get into what

00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:32.110
it's like to have to
create something every day

00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:33.960
and kind of trust
your instincts.

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:37.570
So this is where it's
going to get weird,

00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:40.090
but we'll give it a shot.

00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:56.220
OK the first thing
I want to talk about

00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:58.390
is the creative process.

00:08:58.390 --> 00:09:04.980
To me, the creative process is
very similar in whatever medium

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:06.550
you choose.

00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:12.150
The first step in the creative
process is idea conception.

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:16.310
I'm going to give this a shot.

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:22.020
Let's see.

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:25.170
Bear with me.

00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:26.390
Let's call it the first step.

00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:44.130
It's going to be very abstract.

00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:46.730
By the time we're done,
this thing will be filled.

00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:50.475
Hopefully, if it works, it'll
all kind of makes sense.

00:09:50.475 --> 00:09:51.600
OK, you gotta have an idea.

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:53.505
You gotta have a
conception-- a concept.

00:09:57.507 --> 00:09:59.590
You've got to then be able
to execute the concept.

00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:06.950
One thing about the
creative processes

00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:10.270
it requires a tremendous
amount of honesty.

00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:13.760
And as soon as you come up
with a concept and an idea,

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:17.530
you will quickly find out
what you're capable of doing

00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:23.040
or what you're not
capable of doing.

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:25.840
There's no way
really around that.

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:33.950
So then you have to
really figure out

00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:40.040
what your skill set is and
improve your skill set.

00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:48.020
Stay with me here.

00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:56.580
One of my skill sets
is not necessarily

00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:58.225
giving a speech at Google.

00:11:03.850 --> 00:11:07.290
I find that the creative
process, as I said,

00:11:07.290 --> 00:11:09.420
it exposes your weaknesses.

00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:13.890
And it requires you to kind
of take a step back, pull

00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:16.780
the curtain back, and figure
out where you're not good at.

00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:18.210
OK?

00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:28.990
So it's important at that
point that you really

00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:33.790
dive into practice and effort.

00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:40.252
And at the same time,
you've got to really learn

00:11:40.252 --> 00:11:41.335
how to use your materials.

00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:48.000
AUDIENCE: I've got a question.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.458
BRENDAN MURPHY:
Give me a question.

00:11:49.458 --> 00:11:50.147
Go ahead.

00:11:50.147 --> 00:11:53.570
AUDIENCE: What is it that you
have on here now for this talk?

00:11:53.570 --> 00:11:56.020
What are your thoughts
behind all this?

00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:58.590
BRENDAN MURPHY: OK.

00:11:58.590 --> 00:12:01.880
You'll see some charts
and some figures, here.

00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:07.160
These are my patterns
within this painting.

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:16.470
I kind of rely on certain
things in each painting.

00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:18.900
It's kind of a trick.

00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:20.800
It gives me
something to lean on.

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:22.750
I don't know where
the painting's going.

00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:25.750
I don't know what exactly
we're going to write.

00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:30.070
I have an idea, but I can
rely on this structure.

00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:32.480
It's something that
I've put together.

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:35.830
I've done five paintings,
sorry 10 in the series.

00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:39.440
And I've pretty much
started with the same graphs

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:41.560
in each one.

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:46.680
So this goes back to
learning my skill set.

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:50.740
I know I can rely on
all six of these here.

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:56.090
Jim gave me this
formula as an interest.

00:12:56.090 --> 00:13:01.850
This was Sergey and Larry's
original formula for Google

00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:03.259
when they were at Stanford.

00:13:03.259 --> 00:13:04.800
So I thought I'd
throw that in there.

00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:11.600
What I thought I would
do is in an effort

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:18.310
to ideal creative
output, I'd start there.

00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:29.910
And I'd talk about what
are the different elements

00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:34.350
of ideal creative output,
and then work from there.

00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:46.010
I think, one of the things
that's important is instinct.

00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:49.110
I think what I'm going to do for
now is get away from the cards.

00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:50.235
I'm not doing well with it.

00:13:50.235 --> 00:13:51.860
So I'm just going to talk.

00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:53.452
Go ahead.

00:13:53.452 --> 00:13:54.868
AUDIENCE: When
you're working, you

00:13:54.868 --> 00:13:56.562
have good days and bad days.

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:05.950
BRENDAN MURPHY: I have
very low expectations,

00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:07.755
and so I'm often surprised.

00:14:11.130 --> 00:14:12.670
Which has worked for me.

00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:17.070
And it's interesting
because I had

00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:19.320
this conversation
with my best pal.

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:25.400
And I grew up in a working
class, blue-collar environment.

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:29.190
And the idea of a painter was
somebody who painted homes.

00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:32.520
And my parents were
professors, so not in my house

00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:36.090
but my environment
was very blue collar.

00:14:36.090 --> 00:14:38.500
And the bar is very low.

00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:41.150
The bar of
expectations-- basically

00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:45.100
you were expected to get a
job and not die broke and not

00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:47.450
be homeless.

00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:53.810
And what I've realized with
this whole process of painting

00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:58.550
and becoming an artist-- I've
totally thrown the bar out.

00:14:58.550 --> 00:15:00.900
I'm making a living
making paintings.

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:11.230
So the idea of having any sort
of limit or expectations--

00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:14.730
I'm basically trying,
every day when I sit down

00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:18.330
to do a painting, I'm
throwing out any expectations.

00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:20.250
I'm throwing out any parameters.

00:15:20.250 --> 00:15:25.480
And I think that's a big-- you
really have to be fearless.

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:27.816
Why don't we just add that in?

00:15:27.816 --> 00:15:29.190
And I put a number
in front of it

00:15:29.190 --> 00:15:30.481
because I think it's important.

00:15:33.422 --> 00:15:36.320
AUDIENCE: Sounds
like prism as well.

00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:38.080
BRENDAN MURPHY:
Yeah, that's coming.

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:39.660
Look, I think
everyone in this room

00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:42.667
has a certain skill set that
you've learned in school.

00:15:42.667 --> 00:15:44.000
You guys are pretty comfortable.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.816
You can fall back on a
certain amount of stuff.

00:15:47.816 --> 00:15:49.190
There's probably
someone that you

00:15:49.190 --> 00:15:53.960
work next to that's at that
next level-- something that

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:55.400
makes them different.

00:15:55.400 --> 00:16:01.910
And these two elements
are a big part of that.

00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:03.730
Somewhere along
the line, they had

00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:07.570
to trust their instinct
for no good reason.

00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:11.330
And that instinct, for an
artist, is all that you have.

00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:13.380
It's the only thing that
makes you different--

00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:14.270
is that instinct.

00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:20.880
And I'm continually amazed
when I finish a good painting

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:23.880
and I'm also amazed at how
bad my paintings can be.

00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:28.601
But it's that process of
just trusting and going

00:16:28.601 --> 00:16:29.850
with it that's very important.

00:16:35.691 --> 00:16:37.440
I mean, I'd like to
know a little bit more

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:40.017
about what you guys do,
and I'm sorry go ahead.

00:16:40.017 --> 00:16:41.508
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:54.950
BRENDAN MURPHY: Yeah,
there's a certain--

00:16:54.950 --> 00:16:56.980
I produce a lot of work.

00:16:56.980 --> 00:16:59.450
I work on a daily basis,
whether it's painting

00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:01.629
or-- I'm creating.

00:17:01.629 --> 00:17:03.170
I think there's a
certain point where

00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:05.630
you have to step
away from the work.

00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:09.960
And one of the points I
wanted to talk about today

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:13.300
was the tension and resolution.

00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:21.780
This idea of tension and stress
is not necessarily a bad thing,

00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:23.079
it's required.

00:17:23.079 --> 00:17:26.940
And we're told too much stress
can kill you and too much

00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:28.510
tension-- it's required.

00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:31.860
So I think when you mention a
bad painting or something that

00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:36.660
doesn't represent my work well,
that's part of the tension.

00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:40.420
And then I have to step back and
say, well what did I do wrong?

00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:41.640
What could I do better?

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:43.910
And I have to
improve my skill set.

00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:44.890
And I have to practice.

00:17:44.890 --> 00:17:50.310
Then you get into 10,000
hours, and Malcolm Gladwell,

00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:53.150
which is a very true statement.

00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:59.220
So I would say my success rate
at this point is probably 60%.

00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:02.120
6 out of 10 are
decent paintings,

00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:03.940
and four really fail.

00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:07.189
And two of the 10 are
really exceptional.

00:18:07.189 --> 00:18:08.480
And I'm trying to improve that.

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:10.880
I think when I
started it was lower.

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:12.620
The success rate was much lower.

00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:16.880
You can't really
beat yourself up

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:21.780
too much about it, which
I think is important.

00:18:24.962 --> 00:18:28.130
Anyways, let's talk about
tension and resolution.

00:18:28.130 --> 00:18:31.970
I'm going to jump
around at this point.

00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:35.580
We talk a lot about sports--
stress and recovery,

00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:38.300
the concept of
tension a resolution.

00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:40.630
And my pal brought
up a good point

00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:46.490
that within the painting,
if I push the painting

00:18:46.490 --> 00:18:51.430
to a certain spot, I get
to a spot of tension.

00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:52.920
I don't know what to do.

00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:56.040
And somehow I find an
answer and resolution.

00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:58.700
And then I mess it
up again, and I'm

00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:00.580
in this spot where I
don't know what to do.

00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:02.010
And I resolve it again.

00:19:02.010 --> 00:19:05.380
And every time I go
through this process,

00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:06.505
I land a little bit higher.

00:19:21.734 --> 00:19:22.900
I'm going to add resolution.

00:19:30.050 --> 00:19:31.505
This is a big part
of the process.

00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:35.870
A lot of people get
stuck in the tension.

00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:37.914
A lot of people get
stuck at stress.

00:19:37.914 --> 00:19:39.455
You want to learn
how to play a song,

00:19:39.455 --> 00:19:40.710
or you can't play a chord.

00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:43.080
You don't learn how to play
it you never play the song.

00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:44.530
You can't execute your idea.

00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:49.520
Again, before-- I would like
to know a little bit more

00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:50.690
about what you guys do.

00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:54.260
I'd like to-- I'm thinking--
maybe your process is similar.

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:54.810
I don't know.

00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:55.560
Do you mind?

00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:58.135
What part of the
business are you in?

00:19:58.135 --> 00:20:00.035
AUDIENCE: I work
on Google Fiber.

00:20:00.035 --> 00:20:03.252
I'm a software engineer
on the backend side.

00:20:03.252 --> 00:20:05.180
So anything related to--

00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:07.420
BRENDAN MURPHY:
And you write code?

00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:12.680
And is there a part of that
process where you get stuck,

00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:16.020
and if so, do you--
are you alone?

00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:17.387
Do you have a team?

00:20:17.387 --> 00:20:22.744
AUDIENCE: So sometimes I get
stuck and in some cases I just

00:20:22.744 --> 00:20:25.179
keep getting back
to the problem,

00:20:25.179 --> 00:20:26.802
hitting it from
different angles,

00:20:26.802 --> 00:20:29.724
trying to find that
way of solving.

00:20:29.724 --> 00:20:30.640
BRENDAN MURPHY: Right.

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:35.680
So you keep hitting
this, step back, recover,

00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:36.800
hit the tension again.

00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:39.240
And at each time you
go through that process

00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:41.720
you land a little higher
until you solve it.

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:42.450
And then what?

00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:44.780
Then there's a new problem.

00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:47.854
And this is a daily or weekly
type-- depends on the project?

00:20:47.854 --> 00:20:48.520
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:49.311
BRENDAN MURPHY: OK.

00:20:49.311 --> 00:20:56.960
So that's my painting process
in a much different environment.

00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:58.820
It's a little bit more solitary.

00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:00.640
As my wife can
tell you, I'm very

00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:02.770
comfortable in the unknown.

00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:07.490
I thrive in the unknown which I
think bids well for an artist.

00:21:07.490 --> 00:21:12.630
Or, in trying to achieve
ideal creative output,

00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:15.720
trying to get to that
spot, if you're not

00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:18.490
comfortable with the unknown
you've got to get ready.

00:21:18.490 --> 00:21:20.539
Because there's--
exactly what you said.

00:21:20.539 --> 00:21:23.080
There's a spot where you don't
know exactly where it's going.

00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:25.860
You have an idea,
you have a concept,

00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:30.110
you have your skill
set, and then you begin.

00:21:30.110 --> 00:21:33.410
And you're going to
run into some problems,

00:21:33.410 --> 00:21:36.640
but getting through
those problems

00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:38.940
is then-- all of a sudden
you've broken through

00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:40.310
and you get to this next level.

00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:42.720
And you'll never go back.

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:45.790
So I'm very comfortable
with that process.

00:21:45.790 --> 00:21:47.670
I'm very comfortable
in the unknown.

00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:50.710
And I think it's important if
you're not that type of person,

00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:54.200
I think you have to start
to accept that that's OK.

00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:58.970
It's OK to not know
where it's going.

00:21:58.970 --> 00:22:02.400
It's OK to not have control.

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:06.030
And I think that's an inhibitor.

00:22:06.030 --> 00:22:09.335
That's a real block,
especially in sports.

00:22:12.190 --> 00:22:14.860
We do a lot with
tennis-- I play tennis.

00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:18.060
And we'll be joined by one of
the best players in the world,

00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:19.190
later today.

00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:22.750
And he's a guy who really has--

00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:23.700
AUDIENCE: Who's that?

00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:26.350
BRENDAN MURPHY: Novak Djokavic
is on his way here, today.

00:22:26.350 --> 00:22:29.680
And I don't know if you watched
the match yesterday, but here's

00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:32.830
a guy who-- and I know
because my clothing company--

00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:36.380
we sponsored a guy who
is 30 in the world.

00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:38.390
And he can hit a
tennis ball as well as

00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:41.960
anyone has ever hit a
tennis ball, as can Novak.

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:45.600
And we watched them practice
only a couple weeks ago.

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:48.400
But there was a
clear difference.

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:50.260
It wasn't in how
they hit the ball.

00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:52.150
It was a difference
in instinct, and it

00:22:52.150 --> 00:22:56.320
was different in--
Novak had just a feel.

00:22:56.320 --> 00:23:01.840
He trusted himself
more than his opponent.

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:03.710
And you see it yesterday.

00:23:03.710 --> 00:23:09.340
It is that next level that
I find-- first of all,

00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:12.090
he's very comfortable
in that area

00:23:12.090 --> 00:23:14.410
where ooh, this could go bad.

00:23:14.410 --> 00:23:15.600
He thrives in that.

00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:18.620
And I think that's
a really big deal.

00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:23.910
And I think there's a
reason in my attempt

00:23:23.910 --> 00:23:25.700
to-- I have so much
to share with you

00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:29.700
guys and my attempt to
get some points across.

00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:31.110
This is a big deal.

00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:32.110
This was a big deal.

00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:33.930
Eric Fishchl was
a mentor of mine.

00:23:33.930 --> 00:23:36.620
He's one of the most famous
painters in the world.

00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:41.140
And again, he said,
instinct is all you have.

00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:43.680
That spot where you
get stuck, you've

00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:46.680
got to trust what you feel
is the right direction.

00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:47.600
You got to go with it.

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:49.190
And if you fail,
then do it again.

00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:50.400
And just keep doing that.

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:54.340
Because if you stick
by, let's say, the book,

00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:56.220
there's nothing
different about you

00:23:56.220 --> 00:23:57.780
than the guy
sitting next to you.

00:23:57.780 --> 00:24:01.980
And I think that's a
real spot where people

00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:07.200
get stuck in terms of being
different and differentiation.

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:08.990
People get stuck.

00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:11.860
They say, I'll just
fall back and I'm not

00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:13.240
going to go the extra mile.

00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:16.750
And I find that my best
paintings, and anything I've

00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:19.880
done well, it's come
from like some crazy idea

00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:21.550
that I had internally.

00:24:21.550 --> 00:24:23.180
And then I pursued it, failed.

00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:24.670
Pursued it, failed.

00:24:24.670 --> 00:24:27.100
And somehow it comes together.

00:24:29.650 --> 00:24:32.840
You have to understand,
from where I come from

00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:34.820
and my friends have
joined, here's my wife,

00:24:34.820 --> 00:24:36.300
my dog's even here.

00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:41.400
This was a really-- I mean,
I've given a bunch of speeches,

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:44.920
and I've never had the
problems I've had today.

00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:47.300
But I just was so
excited-- more about being

00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:50.860
in this environment, feeling
like I have contemporaries

00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:55.160
around me who business
understand the element of risk.

00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:58.710
They understand the element of
tension, resolution, stress,

00:24:58.710 --> 00:24:59.760
recovery.

00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:03.560
And I think I got a little
bit too hopped up about it.

00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:07.580
But it's very similar
to the creative process.

00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:10.440
It's a very solitary
pursuit, as well,

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:13.120
as I'm sure a lot of
engineers would understand.

00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:16.859
There's no way around
putting in 10,000 hours.

00:25:16.859 --> 00:25:17.900
There's no way around it.

00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:20.950
There's no way around working
by yourself for a long time

00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:22.350
and working things out.

00:25:22.350 --> 00:25:23.620
There's just no way around it.

00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:26.410
And a lot of kids or younger
people don't really get that.

00:25:26.410 --> 00:25:28.050
You can have talent.

00:25:28.050 --> 00:25:31.590
You don't put the time in--
it's not going to work.

00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:35.170
And again, if you don't
go through that process

00:25:35.170 --> 00:25:40.540
of tension, resolution,
stress, recovery,

00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:42.930
you're just not
going to get there.

00:25:42.930 --> 00:25:52.820
I do want to talk
about discomfort

00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:54.590
and the idea of
being comfortable.

00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:57.130
That's a death blow
for creativity.

00:25:57.130 --> 00:25:58.820
That's a death blow for success.

00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:01.540
Once you're comfortable,
you're done.

00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:08.300
Once you fall back on certain
patterns, you're cooked.

00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:13.120
So I think you need to explore
ways to take yourself out

00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:14.620
of that comfort zone.

00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:15.610
That's a big deal.

00:26:15.610 --> 00:26:20.050
Is there a way to do that
in software engineering?

00:26:20.050 --> 00:26:22.670
That's interesting.

00:26:22.670 --> 00:26:25.775
You're presenting
it as an exercise.

00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:32.080
But it has to
become a condition.

00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:33.150
It's not an exercise.

00:26:33.150 --> 00:26:35.120
It's a condition.

00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:37.180
And I bet you Sergey
and Larry, whoever

00:26:37.180 --> 00:26:41.150
runs-- I'll bet you that's a
condition every day for them.

00:26:41.150 --> 00:26:44.200
It's not an exercise--
I'm not passing judgement

00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:48.280
because we come from that
space where most of us grew up

00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:51.000
or educated under
certain parameters

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.840
where you went
through exercises.

00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:56.080
And it's funny
because it should be

00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:58.660
exactly how you think every day.

00:26:58.660 --> 00:27:01.220
And what's amazing
is the quicker

00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:06.040
you start thinking that way--
I'll give you an example.

00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:08.510
I've used the formulas
in a lot of my paintings.

00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:09.937
Maybe you've seen them.

00:27:09.937 --> 00:27:10.520
And I used it.

00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:12.390
I started using it
as almost a fallback.

00:27:12.390 --> 00:27:14.880
When I didn't know what to
put there I'd write a formula.

00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:16.750
I'd do a beautiful
painting of a woman

00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:18.583
and I wouldn't know
what to put in the space

00:27:18.583 --> 00:27:19.640
and I'd write a formula.

00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:22.940
And to anyone who'd not seen
my paintings it's pretty cool.

00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:25.370
There's kind of a
graffiti element to it,

00:27:25.370 --> 00:27:27.200
but it was a real
fallback for me.

00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:28.680
And I knew it.

00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:34.867
So one day, early this spring,
last year, I said, that's it.

00:27:34.867 --> 00:27:36.450
I'm never doing
another formula again.

00:27:36.450 --> 00:27:37.820
I'm going to do one painting.

00:27:37.820 --> 00:27:41.400
I did a huge painting
and it's only formulas

00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:43.280
and I'm never doing
formulas again.

00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:43.780
I'm done.

00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:45.570
It's the only way I
can get beyond it.

00:27:45.570 --> 00:27:46.580
Sure enough, I do it.

00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:48.010
I put it in the show.

00:27:48.010 --> 00:27:51.770
And I've got a surgeon,
a mathematician,

00:27:51.770 --> 00:27:55.280
and another hedge-fund
guy and they're

00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:59.064
battling over
owning the painting.

00:27:59.064 --> 00:27:59.980
AUDIENCE: In Brooklyn.

00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:01.280
BRENDAN MURPHY: In Brooklyn.

00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:04.140
And I say, oh geez.

00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:08.650
So since then I've done 20
paintings with only formulas,

00:28:08.650 --> 00:28:12.650
but what was fascinating about
it was the surgeon who ended up

00:28:12.650 --> 00:28:16.627
bidding-- [INAUDIBLE]
bought it, what it did was--

00:28:16.627 --> 00:28:18.460
it was the first time
I was doing a painting

00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:20.050
without an image--
without a figure.

00:28:20.050 --> 00:28:23.190
It made me do a painting
with only formulas.

00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:27.360
And inadvertently, it got
me out of these patterns

00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:30.120
to where I've had to make
a painting with no paint.

00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:32.370
Just chalk and words.

00:28:32.370 --> 00:28:37.700
And it was an
interesting process.

00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:43.930
Again, what I did
when I said that's it,

00:28:43.930 --> 00:28:48.371
I'm-- I've been trying to
do that more on just a daily

00:28:48.371 --> 00:28:48.870
basis.

00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:49.744
That was an exercise.

00:28:49.744 --> 00:28:51.910
I said that's it,
I'm going to try it.

00:28:51.910 --> 00:28:56.310
That's it, see what-- so
now ever since then, I mean,

00:28:56.310 --> 00:29:01.490
it's been a process of my own,
but it can't be an exercise.

00:29:01.490 --> 00:29:06.130
It really has to become-- and
it sounds weird, but why not?

00:29:06.130 --> 00:29:07.080
Why not do it?

00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:10.110
Why not make that part of
your daily thought process?

00:29:10.110 --> 00:29:12.070
AUDIENCE: You're
expressing, as you're

00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:15.010
writing these formulas
out-- is it a feeling?

00:29:15.010 --> 00:29:15.990
It is an idea?

00:29:15.990 --> 00:29:18.790
Is it-- are you falling back
on any math that you love?

00:29:18.790 --> 00:29:20.165
BRENDAN MURPHY:
Did you say math?

00:29:20.165 --> 00:29:20.932
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:29:20.932 --> 00:29:21.723
BRENDAN MURPHY: No.

00:29:21.723 --> 00:29:23.556
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:23.556 --> 00:29:25.055
I think it's the
opposite, actually.

00:29:25.055 --> 00:29:29.340
I think it was my-- it was kind
of my-- no, it wasn't hatred,

00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:31.380
it was my fascination
with-- I've always

00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:32.600
wanted to be a mathematician.

00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:35.480
I was probably the
worst-- I'm not probably.

00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:37.190
My high school
teachers would tell you

00:29:37.190 --> 00:29:40.020
that I was not a mathematician.

00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:43.470
But I love figuring things out.

00:29:43.470 --> 00:29:46.960
And it gives me a way.

00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:50.720
And what I wanted to
do-- and it's been hard.

00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:55.930
But generally, when I do one
of these types of paintings,

00:29:55.930 --> 00:29:58.990
I've got some music playing.

00:29:58.990 --> 00:30:01.500
I'm trying to work some
things out in my head.

00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:03.880
I've never done it
in an open forum

00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:06.009
with some sort of structure.

00:30:06.009 --> 00:30:08.300
And what I'm probably going
to do-- just because I want

00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:11.920
to finish this-- you're going
to see-- I'm just going to go.

00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:13.840
I'm just going to do it.

00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:21.440
And I think there is a
certain process for me.

00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:25.470
It's kept me some what
sane, on some level.

00:30:25.470 --> 00:30:28.190
It's given me some
balance, the formulas.

00:30:28.190 --> 00:30:30.440
This idea-- it's
somewhat poetic.

00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:32.480
There's a way of
working some things out

00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:34.770
in my mind in an abstract way.

00:30:37.730 --> 00:30:40.950
And funny thing is, the guys
that have really dug the latest

00:30:40.950 --> 00:30:45.100
series have all been
mathematicians, surgeons,

00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:49.510
and they've put me on to
some really interesting--

00:30:49.510 --> 00:30:50.900
the Fibonacci theory.

00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:53.190
I've always been a fan
of the golden ratio.

00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:55.070
I'm a big believer in patterns.

00:30:55.070 --> 00:30:57.000
I think not only
patterns in your life,

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.360
but patterns that have existed
for years-- thousands of years

00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:01.140
and everything.

00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:02.330
Those patterns exist.

00:31:02.330 --> 00:31:08.700
And to deny them or not
really get to know them

00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:09.830
is a big issue.

00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:13.380
And one of the elements
of my speech today

00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:16.740
we're supposed to go through--
the importance of having

00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:21.920
an understanding of history
of who's done what before you.

00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:23.730
That's been a big
part of my process.

00:31:23.730 --> 00:31:26.880
And any artist's process--
any creative person.

00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:29.010
Who's done what before you?

00:31:29.010 --> 00:31:31.320
How did they do it?

00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:34.570
Because that's the only way
you're going to get your voice.

00:31:34.570 --> 00:31:37.092
From knowing what
has been done, that's

00:31:37.092 --> 00:31:39.550
the only way you're going to
get your own individual voice.

00:31:39.550 --> 00:31:42.580
And that goes back to
knowing what patterns

00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:46.550
and who did-- great
thing about Picasso

00:31:46.550 --> 00:31:50.650
was he was the best at three
or four different mediums.

00:31:50.650 --> 00:31:56.260
But within his Cubism
there were patterns

00:31:56.260 --> 00:31:58.590
that existed that
he worked off of

00:31:58.590 --> 00:32:01.030
and then he just
kind of sprinkled it.

00:32:01.030 --> 00:32:02.930
And then he became the
best guy in Cubism.

00:32:05.850 --> 00:32:10.749
So it's really vital that
you have an understanding

00:32:10.749 --> 00:32:12.040
of what's been done before you.

00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:14.720
And I think what's interesting
here is a lot of stuff that's

00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:16.450
going on here has
never been done.

00:32:16.450 --> 00:32:18.510
But I imagine
writing code there's

00:32:18.510 --> 00:32:21.790
a certain-- is there
not a certain history

00:32:21.790 --> 00:32:24.850
and patterns to
writing certain code?

00:32:24.850 --> 00:32:27.540
I mean, you have to
start somewhere, right?

00:32:27.540 --> 00:32:30.610
And it is interesting.

00:32:30.610 --> 00:32:32.810
This is a new-- there's a
whole new business here.

00:32:37.180 --> 00:32:38.240
Yeah.

00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:39.920
No, that's where
it was really cool.

00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:42.930
I connected with
somebody-- I've always

00:32:42.930 --> 00:32:45.760
enjoyed connecting
with my collectors.

00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:49.673
And it happened to be one of
the top surgeons in New York.

00:32:49.673 --> 00:32:53.600
He's a fascinating guy--
operated on her knee.

00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:57.530
It turned out to be this whole--
we all got to know each other.

00:32:57.530 --> 00:32:59.260
And that was a
fascinating process,

00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:01.500
but we definitely connected.

00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:04.050
Here's somebody who,
by the way operated

00:33:04.050 --> 00:33:07.010
on my wife, who believed
that the pyramids were

00:33:07.010 --> 00:33:10.450
built by time travelers.

00:33:10.450 --> 00:33:14.700
But you want to talk about
an exercise versus thinking

00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:16.730
and this is-- and he's
one of the top surgeons

00:33:16.730 --> 00:33:18.700
and he truly believes that.

00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:20.710
And I'm not discounting--
because he gave me

00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:23.370
real good reason
why that happened.

00:33:23.370 --> 00:33:25.150
But this is the type
of guy-- and that's

00:33:25.150 --> 00:33:26.450
what he saw in the painting.

00:33:26.450 --> 00:33:29.260
And I actually-- in
that mathematical--

00:33:29.260 --> 00:33:34.010
I had touched on the
golden ratio and this

00:33:34.010 --> 00:33:38.590
going back mathematical
patterns, and so on.

00:33:38.590 --> 00:33:41.720
That's what he saw in it-- he
saw that in there and I said,

00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:44.120
yeah that's what I put in
there, Fibonacci and so on.

00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:46.430
He just dies for the stuff.

00:33:46.430 --> 00:33:48.120
But it's interesting.

00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:50.600
You have this
great mind and he's

00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:53.730
telling me that the pyramids
were built by time travelers

00:33:53.730 --> 00:33:55.430
because there's no
way they could move

00:33:55.430 --> 00:33:57.990
the rocks to build the pyramids.

00:33:57.990 --> 00:33:59.670
Only people from
the future-- and he

00:33:59.670 --> 00:34:05.220
gave this whole mathematical
equation how that can happen.

00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:09.350
Again, I didn't really pass
judgment but it was, whoa, OK.

00:34:09.350 --> 00:34:15.998
And then I said well, maybe
I'll explore my own limitations

00:34:15.998 --> 00:34:16.623
intellectually.

00:34:19.650 --> 00:34:21.360
Does that answer your
question, in a way?

00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:23.908
It was fascinating.

00:34:23.908 --> 00:34:26.064
AUDIENCE: What type of
music do you listen to?

00:34:26.064 --> 00:34:27.480
BRENDAN MURPHY:
I'm an audiophile.

00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:29.704
You name it, I listen to it.

00:34:29.704 --> 00:34:31.370
AUDIENCE: Why don't
you listen to books?

00:34:31.370 --> 00:34:33.040
BRENDAN MURPHY: Oh, is
that what audiophile means?

00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:35.290
I thought that an
audiophile means I listen--

00:34:35.290 --> 00:34:37.664
AUDIENCE: Someone who likes
music in all different types.

00:34:37.664 --> 00:34:39.040
BRENDAN MURPHY: Yeah.

00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:40.440
Aha!

00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:43.610
I won that one.

00:34:43.610 --> 00:34:45.290
I never thought I'd
win one at Google.

00:34:45.290 --> 00:34:46.550
I got it.

00:34:46.550 --> 00:34:47.870
No, I listen to everything.

00:34:47.870 --> 00:34:52.300
And it's a big
part of my process.

00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:53.320
You name it.

00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:56.400
Depends on the mood.

00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:58.750
Anything from folk to
rock to reggae-- whatever.

00:34:58.750 --> 00:34:59.450
All day long.

00:34:59.450 --> 00:35:01.700
AUDIENCE: What's the
stuff you don't listen to?

00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:04.090
BRENDAN MURPHY: Heavy,
heavy metal I don't love.

00:35:04.090 --> 00:35:08.870
It doesn't really
generate anything.

00:35:08.870 --> 00:35:11.407
Why, do you listen to
music when you work?

00:35:11.407 --> 00:35:12.490
AUDIENCE: Yeah, sometimes.

00:35:12.490 --> 00:35:12.957
I like music.

00:35:12.957 --> 00:35:14.040
I think music [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:16.234 --> 00:35:17.650
BRENDAN MURPHY:
Music's beautiful.

00:35:17.650 --> 00:35:22.160
We have a musician here,
one of the best around.

00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:27.364
It's just a wonderful--
it's just another medium

00:35:27.364 --> 00:35:28.530
but it's a wonderful medium.

00:35:34.837 --> 00:35:35.545
There are things.

00:35:38.222 --> 00:35:39.930
It's kind of what I
want it to-- and what

00:35:39.930 --> 00:35:41.340
we have been talking about.

00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:50.040
You got to get out
of your comfort zone.

00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:52.320
That's a big deal.

00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:55.070
You got to push
your limitations.

00:35:55.070 --> 00:35:57.570
You got to go beyond
what you think is right,

00:35:57.570 --> 00:35:59.960
and what feels good.

00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:04.160
As far as getting in the
mental state or the zone,

00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:08.530
I think you've got to have a
certain amount of presence.

00:36:08.530 --> 00:36:11.230
We talked about the
word being present.

00:36:11.230 --> 00:36:13.910
And I think that's a big issue.

00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:17.400
I don't know how it
is here, but I've

00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:20.740
had my dog for a couple
years and he likes to hunt.

00:36:20.740 --> 00:36:24.080
We go on walks two
or three times a day.

00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:28.110
It's changed my whole
life, strangely.

00:36:28.110 --> 00:36:29.980
I don't use the phone--
I may use the phone,

00:36:29.980 --> 00:36:31.670
initially-- get rid
of all my calls,

00:36:31.670 --> 00:36:35.280
but at some point during
the walk I'm very present.

00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:38.057
There's no more TV,
computer, phone.

00:36:38.057 --> 00:36:39.640
And it's really made
a big difference.

00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:43.380
It's been my recovery
time-- my resolution time.

00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:49.460
My time to then get ready to
work through the tension again.

00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:51.115
And I think it's very hard, now.

00:36:51.115 --> 00:36:53.240
Because you're just surrounded
and you're always in

00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:55.460
touch with somebody
and something.

00:36:55.460 --> 00:36:58.590
And I don't know that
it's right or wrong,

00:36:58.590 --> 00:37:00.700
because it's just how it is.

00:37:00.700 --> 00:37:04.670
But, boy, since he's forced
me to step away from it--

00:37:04.670 --> 00:37:07.730
some people use meditation, some
people do yoga, some people--

00:37:07.730 --> 00:37:09.580
but he's really forced me.

00:37:09.580 --> 00:37:11.710
And man, it's made
a huge difference

00:37:11.710 --> 00:37:14.666
in the last year in every way.

00:37:14.666 --> 00:37:15.540
And she can tell you.

00:37:15.540 --> 00:37:17.720
We would have--
we have our issues

00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:19.580
but when I come back
from walking the dog,

00:37:19.580 --> 00:37:22.240
we don't have issues anymore.

00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:25.160
And if I have issues with a
painting or anything else,

00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:28.840
that recovery is a big deal.

00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:32.790
And you may not
realize-- I don't know.

00:37:32.790 --> 00:37:36.350
I imagine you're here 12
to 14 hours a day, right?

00:37:36.350 --> 00:37:36.870
Are you?

00:37:36.870 --> 00:37:38.200
I mean, do work here a lot?

00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:39.450
Do you have time to recover?

00:37:39.450 --> 00:37:42.850
Do you have time to
take a break, mentally?

00:37:42.850 --> 00:37:45.830
There's certain warm ups and
certain things you can do.

00:37:45.830 --> 00:37:51.530
I think to me, right now,
I think the biggest thing

00:37:51.530 --> 00:37:53.320
for all of us in
our-- and we all

00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:54.970
seem to be the same generation.

00:37:54.970 --> 00:37:57.140
I think there's a lot
of clutter out there,

00:37:57.140 --> 00:37:59.250
and a lot of distraction.

00:37:59.250 --> 00:38:03.360
And I think that's a big--
the word being present.

00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:05.240
Being present,
being right there,

00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:07.350
right in the painting,
right in the problem,

00:38:07.350 --> 00:38:09.110
I think that's a big issue.

00:38:09.110 --> 00:38:13.290
And I think versus taking
that huge leap where

00:38:13.290 --> 00:38:15.860
I can do anything
and risk whatever.

00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:20.690
I think the more manageable
step is, how do I get present?

00:38:20.690 --> 00:38:21.970
How can I get present more?

00:38:21.970 --> 00:38:23.930
How can I be right there?

00:38:23.930 --> 00:38:26.310
How can I write a better song?

00:38:26.310 --> 00:38:30.260
How can I work through that
tension in that moment?

00:38:30.260 --> 00:38:33.510
How can I treat
my family better?

00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:35.810
How can I be-- I think
that's a bigger issue.

00:38:35.810 --> 00:38:40.120
And I think it would produce
bigger results versus-- that's

00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:43.140
maybe the next stage.

00:38:43.140 --> 00:38:46.810
And there's a certain element,
also, which we haven't hit on.

00:38:46.810 --> 00:38:47.700
This has to be fun.

00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:50.430
It has to be-- you have
to have some passion.

00:38:50.430 --> 00:38:57.200
If this is work, and not
effort-- I put a lot of effort

00:38:57.200 --> 00:38:59.930
into what I do and it's
not necessary work.

00:38:59.930 --> 00:39:03.880
But if what you're doing is
work and-- that's not good.

00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:06.896
You've got to change that ratio.

00:39:06.896 --> 00:39:08.770
Why don't I start putting
stuff on the board?

00:39:19.410 --> 00:39:22.980
There's a good word.

00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:26.140
Are you allowed to have
patience here at Google?

00:39:26.140 --> 00:39:28.800
Does anyone have patience?

00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:31.050
How much time do they give
you to work through things?

00:39:34.170 --> 00:39:37.888
Is there an element of--
or are you on the clock?

00:39:37.888 --> 00:39:38.929
AUDIENCE: It's a balance.

00:39:38.929 --> 00:39:41.923
Those things don't always
happen and you can't always

00:39:41.923 --> 00:39:42.921
force innovation.

00:39:42.921 --> 00:39:45.130
But you can light a fire.

00:39:45.130 --> 00:39:49.530
If you really want something,
you may have pushed through 20

00:39:49.530 --> 00:39:51.670
different ways of doing
it and hope that one--

00:39:51.670 --> 00:39:55.335
or in that process
you spark the true--

00:39:55.335 --> 00:39:56.210
BRENDAN MURPHY: Yeah.

00:39:56.210 --> 00:39:59.630
Deadlines is-- I don't know.

00:39:59.630 --> 00:40:04.510
I mean, I put deadlines on
myself, but I think it's hard.

00:40:04.510 --> 00:40:06.740
I think you gotta be
real careful with that.

00:40:06.740 --> 00:40:08.720
You got to be real
careful with deadlines

00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:11.380
and ideal creative output.

00:40:11.380 --> 00:40:11.880
Yeah.

00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:14.000
I would say for
me, personally, I

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.700
have a real master
in certain materials,

00:40:16.700 --> 00:40:18.900
at least from the
painting and creative-- I

00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:21.170
know what I-- I'm
good with color.

00:40:21.170 --> 00:40:23.400
I'm good with certain--
hard to tell here,

00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:25.265
but I'm very good with color.

00:40:25.265 --> 00:40:26.990
I'm very good with
the materials.

00:40:26.990 --> 00:40:28.840
And I've mastered that.

00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:35.370
And I can tell you that I know
how to get to a certain spot

00:40:35.370 --> 00:40:39.850
in a painting, as a
professional, very easily.

00:40:39.850 --> 00:40:42.840
And then there'll be a
spot in that painting

00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:44.940
where I've got to
trust my instincts.

00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:47.840
And it can go wrong.

00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:50.790
It can go real
wrong, but the more I

00:40:50.790 --> 00:40:54.620
can get to a certain place
just based on my skill set

00:40:54.620 --> 00:40:58.400
and-- I will say this.

00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:00.100
In reference to your
question, if I'm

00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:03.550
about to embark on a painting
that I'm not used to doing,

00:41:03.550 --> 00:41:07.810
I'll practice on a smaller,
more cost-effective,

00:41:07.810 --> 00:41:11.520
manageable kind of
medium to get me there,

00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:15.970
whether it's a sketch--
I'm not a great sketch guy.

00:41:15.970 --> 00:41:17.640
I can't draw great.

00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:19.190
So I might practice
a certain thing

00:41:19.190 --> 00:41:23.370
before-- because I know
once I get in that painting,

00:41:23.370 --> 00:41:25.390
I could ruin it.

00:41:25.390 --> 00:41:27.400
So I want to be prepared.

00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:31.260
And I want to identify the
elements-- for instance,

00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:33.270
I just got a new
collector-- he bought

00:41:33.270 --> 00:41:37.320
Madonna's house--
young guy, finance guy,

00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:39.746
bought Madonna's
house-- $20 million.

00:41:39.746 --> 00:41:41.620
He doesn't have one
piece of art on the wall.

00:41:41.620 --> 00:41:45.740
So I go in, I'm trying to help
him and advise him, as well.

00:41:45.740 --> 00:41:47.740
He liked my work.

00:41:47.740 --> 00:41:50.500
I mean, it's like an artists
dream-- just these walls

00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:53.590
after walls and he doesn't
know much about art.

00:41:53.590 --> 00:41:56.200
That, for me, is great.

00:41:56.200 --> 00:41:57.390
That's my wheel house.

00:41:57.390 --> 00:42:02.750
But at the same time it's
a showcase for my work.

00:42:02.750 --> 00:42:04.490
It gives me a chance
to show some--

00:42:04.490 --> 00:42:08.440
in a real, highly visible arena.

00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:14.430
And I had to find a
painting that would work.

00:42:14.430 --> 00:42:17.180
I found three pieces
that will work for him.

00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:20.440
One of which, I've done--
I did a painting that's

00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:22.700
25 feet wide-- a
flower painting.

00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:24.930
Full color.

00:42:24.930 --> 00:42:26.162
Always use color.

00:42:26.162 --> 00:42:27.620
In this guy's case,
I'm going to do

00:42:27.620 --> 00:42:29.610
a big painting of
just tone on tone.

00:42:29.610 --> 00:42:32.220
It'd be a flower
painting with no color.

00:42:32.220 --> 00:42:34.340
It's kind of a scary thing.

00:42:34.340 --> 00:42:37.690
How do you paint flowers
with only grays and blacks?

00:42:37.690 --> 00:42:42.040
So I've practiced on a
smaller one, and it worked.

00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:43.900
So I'm just going
to now apply-- now

00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:45.350
I just have to
paint a lot bigger,

00:42:45.350 --> 00:42:47.540
but I practiced on
the smaller one.

00:42:47.540 --> 00:42:50.710
I know what works
visually, aesthetically.

00:42:50.710 --> 00:42:52.820
But that's an
example where I just

00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:57.200
did on the smaller one
first instead of-- maybe

00:42:57.200 --> 00:42:59.210
I should just risk it.

00:42:59.210 --> 00:43:02.170
But I think there's a-- you
got to improve your skill set.

00:43:05.820 --> 00:43:07.070
Very rarely.

00:43:07.070 --> 00:43:08.176
Sometimes.

00:43:08.176 --> 00:43:10.180
AUDIENCE: Is it a process
of give up, and then

00:43:10.180 --> 00:43:13.229
just take another direction?

00:43:13.229 --> 00:43:14.770
BRENDAN MURPHY:
Sometimes you lose it

00:43:14.770 --> 00:43:16.162
and you have to start over.

00:43:16.162 --> 00:43:17.620
I think a concept
I want to hit on,

00:43:17.620 --> 00:43:20.790
since we kind of a more
open forum, something that's

00:43:20.790 --> 00:43:24.210
played into-- I don't know
where I heard it or who said it,

00:43:24.210 --> 00:43:26.530
but life is liquid.

00:43:26.530 --> 00:43:28.500
It's not a solid.

00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:30.370
And-- what's that?

00:43:30.370 --> 00:43:32.620
AUDIENCE: It's kind
of like Bruce Lee.

00:43:32.620 --> 00:43:34.050
BRENDAN MURPHY: Move like water.

00:43:34.050 --> 00:43:34.550
Yeah.

00:43:34.550 --> 00:43:37.820
But I mean the actual-- yeah,
that was his whole philosophy.

00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:39.850
But the whole concept
life is liquid

00:43:39.850 --> 00:43:41.900
and when you really
think about it-- a plus

00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:45.820
b just does not-- it
very rarely equals c.

00:43:45.820 --> 00:43:48.230
And as long as we keep trying
to put stuff in the box--

00:43:48.230 --> 00:43:51.460
and I think that applies to
that creative process-- you have

00:43:51.460 --> 00:43:55.775
to kind of get to a space we
you're moving like the stream.

00:43:55.775 --> 00:43:59.760
You're moving liquid, not--
it's just not-- because that's

00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:03.260
going to allow you to kind
of move left, move right,

00:44:03.260 --> 00:44:05.480
and not get stuck anywhere.

00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:12.970
I think that's a
big concept that-- I

00:44:12.970 --> 00:44:15.920
think life experience
is applicable.

00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:19.320
When they say life
experience builds character,

00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:21.000
I'm low on character.

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:22.850
I've had enough of that.

00:44:22.850 --> 00:44:29.030
But I think that some level of
execution that's-- application

00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:31.520
that's required.

00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:33.520
I don't know how
relevant life experience

00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:37.400
is in the coding world.

00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:39.050
It definitely is?

00:44:39.050 --> 00:44:42.540
I mean, because I think
Jim's whole point today--

00:44:42.540 --> 00:44:46.430
and I find fascinating--
was to kind of explore

00:44:46.430 --> 00:44:49.380
what can make you guys different
than your contemporaries?

00:44:49.380 --> 00:44:53.960
And what makes a top
engineer a top engineer?

00:44:53.960 --> 00:44:57.340
And is there something
that I do that can--

00:44:57.340 --> 00:45:01.850
from the creative, just purely
creative-- that can be applied?

00:45:01.850 --> 00:45:05.920
I think that's the whole--
what we're trying to get at.

00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:09.220
And I think it's
very fascinating.

00:45:09.220 --> 00:45:13.740
We met with the director of
sports science at Red Bull.

00:45:13.740 --> 00:45:16.840
They have one of the top sports
science-- believe it or not,

00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:19.280
at Red Bull.

00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:20.950
And he said something
fascinating to us.

00:45:20.950 --> 00:45:26.825
He said, I've witnessed athletes
perform at incredible levels.

00:45:26.825 --> 00:45:27.700
I've seen them do it.

00:45:27.700 --> 00:45:31.107
I've seen them do things
that they don't even--

00:45:31.107 --> 00:45:32.940
and they don't know how
to get back to that.

00:45:32.940 --> 00:45:39.060
And everyone's trying to make
1%, 2% gains, and this guy,

00:45:39.060 --> 00:45:41.465
he believes in 100% gains.

00:45:41.465 --> 00:45:42.840
And maybe we should
start looking

00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:45.420
at-- because he's witnessed
guys do things that

00:45:45.420 --> 00:45:47.810
are just incredible, but then
they can't get back to it.

00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:52.370
Which is an
interesting approach,

00:45:52.370 --> 00:45:56.040
where maybe 1%
incremental gains-- maybe

00:45:56.040 --> 00:45:57.320
we're looking at things wrong.

00:45:57.320 --> 00:46:00.170
Maybe you really do--
instead of an exercise,

00:46:00.170 --> 00:46:01.980
you shoot for the moon.

00:46:01.980 --> 00:46:04.600
What's the downside?

00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:06.950
What's the downside?

00:46:06.950 --> 00:46:08.270
You don't fall, you land.

00:46:08.270 --> 00:46:12.630
You land back to where you
already have your base.

00:46:12.630 --> 00:46:13.480
And I don't know.

00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:17.050
Do they fire you, here,
if you're way wrong?

00:46:17.050 --> 00:46:18.940
So you don't fall.

00:46:18.940 --> 00:46:19.670
You don't fall.

00:46:19.670 --> 00:46:21.026
You land.

00:46:21.026 --> 00:46:21.650
It's different.

00:46:21.650 --> 00:46:23.450
Fall means you-- right?

00:46:23.450 --> 00:46:27.930
And landing-- you
can start again.

00:46:27.930 --> 00:46:29.170
You can start again.

00:46:29.170 --> 00:46:31.729
AUDIENCE: One question-- would
be a great painting versus

00:46:31.729 --> 00:46:32.520
your own instinct--

00:46:35.329 --> 00:46:37.620
BRENDAN MURPHY: I don't think
about anybody else, yeah.

00:46:37.620 --> 00:46:39.661
AUDIENCE: You think about
what you think is cool.

00:46:39.661 --> 00:46:40.542
This is what I think.

00:46:40.542 --> 00:46:41.930
You're not thinking about
what somebody else--

00:46:41.930 --> 00:46:42.370
BRENDAN MURPHY: No.

00:46:42.370 --> 00:46:44.411
AUDIENCE: Do you think
people struggle with that?

00:46:44.411 --> 00:46:46.440
BRENDAN MURPHY:
Yes, tremendously.

00:46:46.440 --> 00:46:49.480
The difference between ideal
creative output and just

00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:53.950
being decent, that's it.

00:46:53.950 --> 00:46:59.969
Alberto Bertini, my friend
from Australia, big developer.

00:46:59.969 --> 00:47:02.010
Built some of the biggest
buildings in Australia,

00:47:02.010 --> 00:47:04.470
sold his company
for $300 million,

00:47:04.470 --> 00:47:06.420
went off the reservation.

00:47:06.420 --> 00:47:09.070
He's now covered
in tattoos, rings.

00:47:09.070 --> 00:47:11.230
Bought his own island in Fiji.

00:47:11.230 --> 00:47:13.340
We had dinner with
them last week.

00:47:13.340 --> 00:47:15.430
The girls stepped
away-- and the guy's

00:47:15.430 --> 00:47:19.020
completely out of his mind on
some level, super successful.

00:47:19.020 --> 00:47:21.870
And I said, what's the one
thing that you can tell?

00:47:21.870 --> 00:47:23.486
What's the difference?

00:47:23.486 --> 00:47:24.860
What's been the
difference maker?

00:47:24.860 --> 00:47:28.320
He's just an incredible guy.

00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:31.520
And the word he used
was fearlessness.

00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:32.390
Fearless.

00:47:32.390 --> 00:47:34.750
Because the minute you
start thinking-- whatever

00:47:34.750 --> 00:47:38.680
the people-- and this is
a guy who has done it.

00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:39.990
And still does it.

00:47:39.990 --> 00:47:42.810
And I thought that
was very interesting.

00:47:42.810 --> 00:47:45.660
That was the one word he gave
me, was just this fearlessness.

00:47:45.660 --> 00:47:50.250
And he said he's meeting
with the founder of Cirque du

00:47:50.250 --> 00:47:51.610
Soleil, today.

00:47:51.610 --> 00:47:52.820
I put them together.

00:47:52.820 --> 00:47:54.720
Same kind of guy.

00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:56.187
Just fearless, and it's bizarre.

00:47:56.187 --> 00:47:57.520
Because we don't come from that.

00:47:57.520 --> 00:47:59.140
It's not how we were raised.

00:47:59.140 --> 00:48:02.932
We were raised to be
cautious and watch out

00:48:02.932 --> 00:48:07.420
and it's going to hold you back
from getting to that next spot.

00:48:07.420 --> 00:48:09.550
It just feels
really uncomfortable

00:48:09.550 --> 00:48:12.030
but it's where you need to be.

00:48:12.030 --> 00:48:13.580
[APPLAUSE]
