00:00:01.334 --> 00:00:03.044
NARRATOR: Ancient

00:00:03.044 --> 00:00:07.006
suggest that Earth may have
acted as a laboratory in which

00:00:07.006 --> 00:00:10.802
extraterrestrials experimented
with various lifeforms,

00:00:10.802 --> 00:00:14.389
and as evidence point to
the numerous ancient stories

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:17.016
of hybrid creatures.

00:00:17.016 --> 00:00:19.978
Hybrid creatures
abound in mythology.

00:00:19.978 --> 00:00:24.274
All over the world, we get
animals that are partly

00:00:24.274 --> 00:00:27.485
one thing, partly another.

00:00:27.485 --> 00:00:30.905
In ancient Greek, we
hear about the cerberus,

00:00:30.905 --> 00:00:33.283
a terrifying
three-headed dog who

00:00:33.283 --> 00:00:37.996
was the guardian of the
portal to the underworld.

00:00:37.996 --> 00:00:40.790
The Greeks also
had the centaur--

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:47.547
half human, half horse, a
large and impressive creature.

00:00:47.547 --> 00:00:50.633
In Hindu mythology, we
have the [non-english]..

00:00:50.633 --> 00:00:53.928
These are strange-looking
characters,

00:00:53.928 --> 00:00:59.476
serpentine at the bottom, human
torsos and heads and faces.

00:00:59.476 --> 00:01:01.895
Even in the Koran,
the horse that

00:01:01.895 --> 00:01:07.192
was said to have flown Mohammad
from Mecca to Jerusalem

00:01:07.192 --> 00:01:11.905
was a flying horse
with a human face.

00:01:11.905 --> 00:01:17.202
Either it's all
fantasy or our ancestors

00:01:17.202 --> 00:01:18.870
witnessed these things.

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.290
And if they witnessed them,
there's two options to that.

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.751
Either these creatures
actually came

00:01:24.751 --> 00:01:27.712
here, or whatever
extraterrestrials

00:01:27.712 --> 00:01:30.548
were here created them.

00:01:30.548 --> 00:01:36.763
And it's a huge, huge question,
because both possibilities,

00:01:36.763 --> 00:01:38.848
in my opinion, are possible.

00:01:43.603 --> 00:01:45.647
NARRATOR: If the hybrid
creatures described

00:01:45.647 --> 00:01:50.026
in ancient mythologies really
did exist alongside humans

00:01:50.026 --> 00:01:53.321
and other intelligent
hominids, is it possible

00:01:53.321 --> 00:01:56.449
that Charles Darwin's
theory of natural selection

00:01:56.449 --> 00:02:00.995
played a role in the
rise of humans after all?

00:02:00.995 --> 00:02:04.541
Could it be a case of
alien intervention on Earth

00:02:04.541 --> 00:02:07.043
creating numerous
species that were then

00:02:07.043 --> 00:02:10.713
forced to fight for survival?

00:02:10.713 --> 00:02:13.341
Perhaps further
clues can be found

00:02:13.341 --> 00:02:16.678
by examining stories of an
ancient cataclysm, often

00:02:16.678 --> 00:02:20.515
referred to as the Great Flood.

00:02:20.515 --> 00:02:23.935
The Bible teaches
us an ancient legend

00:02:23.935 --> 00:02:27.272
that there was a global flood.

00:02:27.272 --> 00:02:30.567
We all know that the
sins of the people

00:02:30.567 --> 00:02:33.695
would cause God to intervene.

00:02:33.695 --> 00:02:38.908
But yet the legends tell us
that the actual problem that

00:02:38.908 --> 00:02:44.455
occurred at this time was an
extraterrestrial involvement

00:02:44.455 --> 00:02:48.293
and manipulation
of human genetics.

00:02:48.293 --> 00:02:53.590
The Bible speaks in Genesis,
chapter 6 of the sons of God

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.218
who came down from
heaven and took

00:02:57.218 --> 00:03:00.930
the daughters of men
as wives from which

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.850
were born a race of titans--

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.477
[non-english] is
the Hebrew word--

00:03:06.477 --> 00:03:12.400
and that they unleashed terror
and havoc upon the world

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.237
The books of Enoch teach
us that these sons of God

00:03:16.237 --> 00:03:20.366
were the angels who
came down from heaven.

00:03:20.366 --> 00:03:23.870
The development was
going the wrong direction,

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.583
and then they decided to start
the whole experiment again.

00:03:28.583 --> 00:03:30.877
They decided to
create a great flood.

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:37.550
We have stories
of the Great Flood

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:39.594
practically all over the world--

00:03:39.594 --> 00:03:43.097
not only in the Bible, not
only in the Gilgamesh epic,

00:03:43.097 --> 00:03:45.975
not only in the Enuma
Elish from the Sumerian.

00:03:45.975 --> 00:03:48.853
We have it in Central
America among the Mayans.

00:03:48.853 --> 00:03:52.190
We have it in South America
among the Kogi Indians

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:53.608
that lived in Colombia.

00:03:53.608 --> 00:03:55.735
Always the Great Flood story.

00:03:55.735 --> 00:03:59.489
But in every case, there
was a so-called god

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:04.827
who gave instructions
to construct a ship.

00:04:04.827 --> 00:04:08.122
And this is where ancient
legends get very interesting.

00:04:08.122 --> 00:04:13.544
Because while Noah was building
his ark and saving his animals,

00:04:13.544 --> 00:04:16.714
other legends say that
others of his generation

00:04:16.714 --> 00:04:22.011
took other precautions, some
building other types of ships

00:04:22.011 --> 00:04:23.221
which were to go to the stars.

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:29.686
And what is also interesting
is that the legends

00:04:29.686 --> 00:04:34.232
tell us that not all animals
were included on Noah's Arc.

00:04:36.859 --> 00:04:39.237
NARRATOR: Does the
story of the Great Flood

00:04:39.237 --> 00:04:41.948
provide evidence that
extraterrestrials have been

00:04:41.948 --> 00:04:44.826
experimenting with
different lifeforms on Earth

00:04:44.826 --> 00:04:48.538
for thousands of years?

00:04:48.538 --> 00:04:50.999
Ancient astronaut
theorists suggest

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:54.627
that such experimentation
continues to this day,

00:04:54.627 --> 00:04:58.923
but that it is now being
directed by humans.
