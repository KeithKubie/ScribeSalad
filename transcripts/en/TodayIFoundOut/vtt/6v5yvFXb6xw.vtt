00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:12.090
Although it’s difficult to find written
accounts, it appears that people have been

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.960
propelling themselves through the air with
poles since ancient times.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:22.190
In fact, depictions of people leaping with
poles can be found as far back as 400 BC.

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:27.660
A practical and inexpensive way to traverse
swampy marshy areas, propelling over wet places

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.000
on poles has traditionally been a common practice
in the fens of Cambridgeshire, Lincolnshire,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.769
Norfolk and Huntingdonshire, UK, as well as
the marshes of the Netherlands.

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:41.690
As the bogs and estuaries were drained and
developed, it became custom for residents

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.539
to keep jumping poles for use while walking
around outside.

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.090
Not restricted to the countryside, vaulting
water with poles has also been a popular technique

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.969
employed by Venice’s gondoliers, when moving
from their watercraft to shore.

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:59.889
Over the years, pole vaulting changed from
being a pragmatic mode of transportation to

00:00:59.889 --> 00:01:00.949
a sport.

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:06.630
In 1843, the idea of competing for height
as opposed to distance was pioneered at an

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.730
early contest at Ulverston Football and Cricket
Club in Lancashire.

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:15.780
By 1850, competitions in the sport were being
held routinely in Germany, and by the mid-19th

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.460
century, the techniques we see today were
already in use in the U.S.

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.660
Although the poles were formerly made of aluminum
or bamboo, by the 1950s, modern composites

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:32.200
such as fiberglass were substituted – making
for a stronger, yet equally light, pole that

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.950
enabled vaulters to reach even greater heights.

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.100
However, there was one very significant change
to the sport that happened only relatively

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.100
recently.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.050
In the early 1980s, five-time All-American
from Indiana University, Dave Volz, perfected

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.170
a technique of steadying the cross-bar during
a jump.

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.170
Volz was burly for a pole vaulter, at 185
pounds, and according to his friends, he would

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.460
“go down that runway so hard he’s almost
out of control.”

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.340
Having quick reactions while sailing through
the air, if he happened to hit the cross bar,

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.820
Volz would “reach out with his left hand,
grab the bar and steady it on the standards

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.569
while suspended in midair.”

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:13.700
Giving himself a distinct advantage, “Volzing”
allowed Volz to try for ever greater heights,

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.010
and set new records.

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.950
Having good success early, he raised the American
record twice in 1982 (to 18′ 10.5″), but

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.910
injuries that year to his left ankle had a
lasting effect.

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.980
Unable to make the Olympic team in 1984 and
1988 (he broke his right leg in multiple places

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:37.350
in 1987), Volz surprised everyone when he
finally made the U.S. Olympic Team in 1992

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:38.709
– and took fifth place.

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:43.330
Not everyone was impressed with his gymnastics,
however, and some of his competitors even

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:48.250
claimed that Volzing, “ruined” the sport,
even though it required incredible skill that

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.160
few could reliably emulate, perhaps making
the sport even more challenging.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.800
In the end, many apparently agreed with the
opponents of Volzing, and today, it has been

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.910
banned by every main athletic association
including the International Association of

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:07.620
Athletics Federations (IAAF), the National
Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), the

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:15.360
National Federation of State High School Associations
(NFHS), and USA Track &amp; Field, Inc.

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.840
(USATF), whose Rule 183(5)(d) provides:

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.170
It shall be a failure if . . . during the
vault, the vaulter steadies or replaces the

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:52.030
bar

00:03:52.030 --> 00:04:13.480
with his/her hand(s).
