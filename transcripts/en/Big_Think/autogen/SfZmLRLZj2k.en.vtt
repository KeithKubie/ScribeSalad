usually worked for me and I felt like
there was nothing there was this

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:30.339
there was nothing there was this
 

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:32.609
there was nothing there was this
blankness it was almost as though there

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:32.619
blankness it was almost as though there
 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.660
blankness it was almost as though there
was sand in my brain and I started to

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:36.670
was sand in my brain and I started to
 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:38.639
was sand in my brain and I started to
think like what the you know first of

00:00:38.639 --> 00:00:38.649
think like what the you know first of
 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:40.349
think like what the you know first of
all what the hell and second of all like

00:00:40.349 --> 00:00:40.359
all what the hell and second of all like
 

00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:42.599
all what the hell and second of all like
well wait a minute when had I had my

00:00:42.599 --> 00:00:42.609
well wait a minute when had I had my
 

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:45.240
well wait a minute when had I had my
last best ideas and why was I

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.250
last best ideas and why was I
 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:46.950
last best ideas and why was I
potentially having so much trouble now

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960
potentially having so much trouble now
 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.299
potentially having so much trouble now
and I thought back and it was really

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:51.309
and I thought back and it was really
 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:53.189
and I thought back and it was really
when I was staring out the window such a

00:00:53.189 --> 00:00:53.199
when I was staring out the window such a
 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:54.569
when I was staring out the window such a
cliche it was when I was staring at the

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:54.579
cliche it was when I was staring at the
 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:57.000
cliche it was when I was staring at the
window or I was in the shower or I was

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.010
window or I was in the shower or I was
 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.979
window or I was in the shower or I was
pushing my kid's stroller for miles and

00:00:58.979 --> 00:00:58.989
pushing my kid's stroller for miles and
 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:00:59.340
pushing my kid's stroller for miles and
miles

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.350
miles
 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.549
miles
that is when I had my best ideas and now

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:02.559
that is when I had my best ideas and now
 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:04.619
that is when I had my best ideas and now
I realized that all those little cracks

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629
I realized that all those little cracks
 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:06.690
I realized that all those little cracks
in my day all those moments when I used

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700
in my day all those moments when I used
 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.460
in my day all those moments when I used
to sort of just be spacing out what was

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470
to sort of just be spacing out what was
 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.890
to sort of just be spacing out what was
I doing I was looking at this thing

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:10.900
I doing I was looking at this thing
 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.870
I doing I was looking at this thing
right I was looking at my phone when I

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880
right I was looking at my phone when I
 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.580
right I was looking at my phone when I
was waiting in line for coffee when I

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590
was waiting in line for coffee when I
 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.250
was waiting in line for coffee when I
was on the bus every single one of those

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:17.260
was on the bus every single one of those
 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.290
was on the bus every single one of those
moments and it made me realize like I

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:19.300
moments and it made me realize like I
 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.980
moments and it made me realize like I
was never bored ever in my life anymore

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990
was never bored ever in my life anymore
 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.260
was never bored ever in my life anymore
in fact I might not have been bored

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270
in fact I might not have been bored
 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.590
in fact I might not have been bored
since I think 2009 which is when I first

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600
since I think 2009 which is when I first
 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.930
since I think 2009 which is when I first
got an iPhone I was a late adapter and

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:30.940
got an iPhone I was a late adapter and
 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:32.760
got an iPhone I was a late adapter and
so then it made me think like well what

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770
so then it made me think like well what
 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.040
so then it made me think like well what
actually happens in our brains when we

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:35.050
actually happens in our brains when we
 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.190
actually happens in our brains when we
get bored and what could potentially be

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200
get bored and what could potentially be
 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.250
get bored and what could potentially be
happening if we never get bored ever

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:41.260
happening if we never get bored ever
 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.950
happening if we never get bored ever
again is if we got rid of this sort of

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960
again is if we got rid of this sort of
 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.620
again is if we got rid of this sort of
human state altogether is boredom

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630
human state altogether is boredom
 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.010
human state altogether is boredom
actually a useful sort of emotion so I

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.420
actually a useful sort of emotion so I

me who was feeling like there was sand
 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.059
me who was feeling like there was sand
in their brain so what I wanted to

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069
in their brain so what I wanted to
 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:43.559
in their brain so what I wanted to
understand first of all was what

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:43.569
understand first of all was what
 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:45.539
understand first of all was what
actually happens in our brains when we

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:45.549
actually happens in our brains when we
 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:48.270
actually happens in our brains when we
get bored and it's fascinating I had no

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280
get bored and it's fascinating I had no
 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.979

idea that we are at this moment in
 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:51.330
idea that we are at this moment in
history where we are starting to

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340
history where we are starting to
 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.370
history where we are starting to
understand what happens in the brain

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380
understand what happens in the brain
 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.830
understand what happens in the brain
when we allow it to just sort of wander

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840
when we allow it to just sort of wander
 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.259

so what they know now is that when you
get bored you activate a network in your

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200

get bored you activate a network in your
brain called the default mode and you

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690
brain called the default mode and you
 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.000

you can't this is different than
