00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.936
 (bright music)

00:00:14.747 --> 00:00:15.948
- My name's Mike Perry.

00:00:15.981 --> 00:00:17.483 size:84% position:42%
  I'm working on a special,

00:00:17.516 --> 00:00:21.521 size:84% position:42%
  crazy first time animated
  episode of Broad City.

00:00:24.356 --> 00:00:25.792
 I've been doing the
 titles for years now,

00:00:25.825 --> 00:00:27.493 align:start position:0%
 and it's been really fun
 to be a part of the project

00:00:27.526 --> 00:00:28.928
 since the beginning.

00:00:28.961 --> 00:00:31.297 size:88% position:44%
 (rap music)

00:00:34.733 --> 00:00:37.136 align:start position:0%
  - Open animation, it's not
  separate from the show,

00:00:37.169 --> 00:00:39.005 size:84% position:42%
  it is part of the
  Broad City world.

00:00:39.038 --> 00:00:43.543
 Mike Perry, he also has kind
 of become our visual brand.

00:00:43.576 --> 00:00:46.312 align:start position:0%
 - You know the relationship
 with the titles versus

00:00:46.345 --> 00:00:50.750 align:start position:0%
 what I'm doing now for episode
 404, is very different.

00:00:50.783 --> 00:00:54.454
 The episode involves
 live action world,

00:00:54.487 --> 00:00:56.689 align:start size:88% position:13%
  transitioning into
  cartoon world.

00:00:56.722 --> 00:00:59.759
The fully animated part
is about eight minutes,

00:00:59.792 --> 00:01:03.663
so we have to take the
viewer on a journey from

00:01:05.097 --> 00:01:09.102
 before they consume to when
 they're getting their buzz on,

00:01:09.135 --> 00:01:11.871 align:start size:88% position:13%
to where they're
tripping their face off,

00:01:11.904 --> 00:01:13.940
just wandering glowing canyons.

00:01:13.973 --> 00:01:17.877 align:start position:0%
- We had written him this
whole list of background jokes,

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:19.846 size:88% position:44%
  about like 10 pages of it.

00:01:19.879 --> 00:01:24.050
 You have to watch it so many
 times to get all the jokes.

00:01:26.185 --> 00:01:27.820 align:start position:0%
 There's a guy skateboarding
 along the street,

00:01:27.853 --> 00:01:29.322 size:88% position:44%
  but it's pancakes.

00:01:29.355 --> 00:01:33.860 align:start position:0%
 - Yeah, he's on a pad of
 butter, skating on a pancake.

00:01:33.893 --> 00:01:36.496
 (bright music)

00:01:37.963 --> 00:01:41.300
 - Every season they put one
 of their PAs in the background

00:01:41.333 --> 00:01:43.636
just jerking off on the street.

00:01:43.669 --> 00:01:48.307
 So we've been requested to put
 him into our animated world.

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:49.742 size:84% position:42%
  - Is it weird my
  nipples are sore?

00:01:49.775 --> 00:01:51.077
 - No that is perfectly normal.

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:52.145 size:88% position:44%
 - Mine are bleeding

00:01:52.178 --> 00:01:53.679
(cat squealing)

00:01:53.712 --> 00:01:56.115 size:84% position:42%
  - One of the things that
  I personally think about,

00:01:56.148 --> 00:01:58.618
 when I think about
 mushrooms as a drug,

00:01:58.651 --> 00:02:02.355 size:84% position:42%
  is how often it fills you
  with a level of warmth

00:02:02.388 --> 00:02:06.325 align:start size:88% position:13%
and positivity, and also
feminine and glowing,

00:02:06.358 --> 00:02:10.796
 and so it was really great
 opportunity to get into that

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:15.067 align:start position:0%
 in this drawing, and
 having it be saturated with

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.837 align:start size:88% position:13%
 really beautiful
 moment, if animated.

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.705
 - You really feel like
 you're with the girls,

00:02:19.738 --> 00:02:23.409 align:start position:0%
 tripping with them, increasing
 the trip, decreasing

00:02:23.442 --> 00:02:26.479 align:start position:0%
and then doing the stupid
thing of adding weed too early.

00:02:26.512 --> 00:02:29.015
 (blowing out)

00:02:32.184 --> 00:02:35.388
- I am feeling that the weed...

00:02:35.421 --> 00:02:36.923
 - Mmm.

00:02:36.956 --> 00:02:40.059
- I mostly sketched out
everything on paper,

00:02:40.092 --> 00:02:42.461 align:start size:88% position:13%
I cannot iterate how
important the sketchbook

00:02:42.494 --> 00:02:44.297
 part of the process is for me.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.567
 Oh here we go, this is one
 of the first drawings I did.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.702 align:start size:88% position:13%
 This mother is flying
 with the babies

00:02:49.735 --> 00:02:52.005 size:88% position:44%
 hanging from their breasts.

00:02:52.905 --> 00:02:55.007 size:84% position:42%
  - That's comic book shit.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.243 align:start size:88% position:13%
- So a lot of this stuff
starts in the books

00:02:57.276 --> 00:03:01.714
 and the finds its way into the
 appropriate part of the world

00:03:01.747 --> 00:03:05.652
this is a possible cut
out for the music scene.

00:03:06.986 --> 00:03:08.621 align:start position:0%
  Abby and Alana are
  basically playing the city

00:03:08.654 --> 00:03:11.224 align:start size:88% position:13%
  as though it's
  like an orchestra,

00:03:11.257 --> 00:03:14.093 size:84% position:42%
  and so this would just be
  kind of like a cut shot,

00:03:14.126 --> 00:03:18.298
 to this scene of jamming out
 as the whole city jams out.

00:03:22.101 --> 00:03:24.904 size:84% position:42%
  - You could tell how much
  fun he had making this,

00:03:24.937 --> 00:03:28.374 align:start position:0%
  and it's so, I cannot
  wait for people to see it.

00:03:28.407 --> 00:03:29.709 size:84% position:42%
  - I love you man.

00:03:29.742 --> 00:03:31.744
 - I love you too, man.

00:03:31.777 --> 00:03:34.547
(electric music)
