00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.200
The left side of our equation looks good now. This is exactly the sort of thing

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.460
that we're looking for, y minus the constant. The right side is not quite there

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.603
yet though. Eventually, we want this to be x minus some constant and that whole

00:00:12.603 --> 00:00:16.717
thing squared. Well, if you think about it, we're actually well on our way. If

00:00:16.717 --> 00:00:20.685
you think about this right side in the general form of this equation, we can

00:00:20.685 --> 00:00:24.653
multiply out the quantity x minus h squared to get x squared minus 2hx plus h

00:00:24.653 --> 00:00:29.217
squared. You've seen things like this a lot of times before. So here, it looks

00:00:29.217 --> 00:00:33.371
like we have this term covered, the x squared term, and we also have the term

00:00:33.371 --> 00:00:37.755
the x to the first covered. What we're missing is this constant. What constant

00:00:37.755 --> 00:00:41.403
do we need to add on to the end of x squared minus 8x in order to be able to

00:00:41.403 --> 00:00:45.509
factor it in the form x minus h squared. So, just think of what constant belongs

00:00:45.509 --> 00:00:49.596
here in order to make this expression on the right-hand side, the perfect square

00:00:49.596 --> 00:00:51.357
of some polynomial of two terms.
