on the bush not far from where we are
 

00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:52.900

now and he suddenly picked up his ears
 

00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:55.299
now and he suddenly picked up his ears
and he started moving off in this

and he started moving off in this
 

00:10:55.309 --> 00:10:58.359
and he started moving off in this
direction at quite a pace and it's only

00:10:58.359 --> 00:10:58.369
direction at quite a pace and it's only
 

00:10:58.369 --> 00:11:01.809
direction at quite a pace and it's only
then that we finally saw the warthog who

00:11:01.809 --> 00:11:01.819
then that we finally saw the warthog who
 

00:11:01.819 --> 00:11:04.179
then that we finally saw the warthog who
is doing a very good job of remaining

00:11:04.179 --> 00:11:04.189
is doing a very good job of remaining
 

00:11:04.189 --> 00:11:07.869
is doing a very good job of remaining

00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:16.600
 
and if they do go down I have seen

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:16.610
and if they do go down I have seen
 

00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:19.540

more I think he is maybe wondering
 

00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:24.220
more I think he is maybe wondering
whether he could get closer

had an opportunity he's climbed up onto
 

00:12:38.759 --> 00:12:40.999
had an opportunity he's climbed up onto
a termite mound and he's had a little

00:12:40.999 --> 00:12:41.009
a termite mound and he's had a little
 

00:12:41.009 --> 00:12:43.249
a termite mound and he's had a little
bit of a look and every time he's done

that we've had a look and it was only
just recently that something got his

00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:48.120
just recently that something got his

picked up on a very strong smell but
 

00:12:55.889 --> 00:12:58.189
picked up on a very strong smell but
looking at him he is looking intently

looking at him he is looking intently
 

00:12:58.199 --> 00:13:01.549
looking at him he is looking intently
towards and that warthog but he's not

towards and that warthog but he's not
 

00:13:01.559 --> 00:13:04.519
towards and that warthog but he's not
moving he's probably trying to weigh up

00:13:04.519 --> 00:13:04.529
moving he's probably trying to weigh up
 

00:13:04.529 --> 00:13:07.579

00:33:26.779 --> 00:33:26.789
of thorns as the thorns can also be
 

00:33:26.789 --> 00:33:30.019
of thorns as the thorns can also be
dangerous to their tongues so if this

00:33:30.019 --> 00:33:30.029
dangerous to their tongues so if this
 

00:33:30.029 --> 00:33:32.269
dangerous to their tongues so if this
giraffe shows us his tongue you will see

00:33:32.269 --> 00:33:32.279
giraffe shows us his tongue you will see
 

00:33:32.279 --> 00:33:35.029
giraffe shows us his tongue you will see
the tongue is much more dark so that

00:33:35.029 --> 00:33:35.039
the tongue is much more dark so that
 

00:33:35.039 --> 00:33:38.149
the tongue is much more dark so that
they can also avoid the sunlight as they

00:33:38.149 --> 00:33:38.159
they can also avoid the sunlight as they
 

00:33:38.159 --> 00:33:41.690
they can also avoid the sunlight as they
are feeding to prevent sunburn the

00:33:41.690 --> 00:33:41.700
are feeding to prevent sunburn the
 

00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:51.760
are feeding to prevent sunburn the
colour of the tongue is much darker

00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:51.770
 
 

00:33:51.770 --> 00:33:53.890
 
so the tree this giraffe is feeding on

00:33:53.890 --> 00:33:53.900
so the tree this giraffe is feeding on
 

00:33:53.900 --> 00:33:56.200
so the tree this giraffe is feeding on
the buffalo thorn is one of those trees

00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:56.210
the buffalo thorn is one of those trees
 

00:33:56.210 --> 00:34:03.240
the buffalo thorn is one of those trees
which are also very much medicinal used

00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:03.250
 
 

00:34:03.250 --> 00:34:06.490
 
here at the moment we have got only one

00:34:06.490 --> 00:34:06.500
here at the moment we have got only one
 

00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:09.040
here at the moment we have got only one
which is the one we are seeing we don't

00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:09.050
which is the one we are seeing we don't
 

00:34:09.050 --> 00:34:12.159
which is the one we are seeing we don't
have the two species of giraffe this is

00:34:12.159 --> 00:34:12.169
have the two species of giraffe this is
 

00:34:12.169 --> 00:34:14.139
have the two species of giraffe this is
the only type of giraffe we are having

00:34:14.139 --> 00:34:14.149
the only type of giraffe we are having
 

00:34:14.149 --> 00:34:17.020
the only type of giraffe we are having
at the moment so if you can check this

00:34:17.020 --> 00:34:17.030
at the moment so if you can check this
 

00:34:17.030 --> 00:34:19.379

giraffe is looking very much dark and
one of the difference between the male

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:22.010
one of the difference between the male
 

00:34:22.010 --> 00:34:25.090
one of the difference between the male
and the female giraffes is the Acala the

00:34:25.090 --> 00:34:25.100
and the female giraffes is the Acala the
 

00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:27.399
and the female giraffes is the Acala the
giraffes the males they have got dark

00:34:27.399 --> 00:34:27.409
giraffes the males they have got dark
 

00:34:27.409 --> 00:34:29.590
