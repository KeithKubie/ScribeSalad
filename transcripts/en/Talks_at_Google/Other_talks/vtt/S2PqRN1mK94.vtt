00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.240
&gt;&gt;Scott Morrison: Hi, everyone.

00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:02.240
I'm Scott Morrison.

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:04.410
I'm the President of the MIT Club of New York.

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:10.010
And to begin with, I'd like to thank Stu and
also Graham Wharton from Google, who helped

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:15.789
us make the arrangements for this facility
tonight, and for all of the networking activity

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:16.789
and so forth.

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:20.019
So, could I have a round of applause please
for Stu and Graham?

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:21.019
[applause]

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:22.019
Thanks.

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:26.490
So, to continue with tonight's program, I'd
just like to introduce our speakers.

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:34.110
First, Cecilia D'Oliveira served as Technology
Director for MIT's OpenCourseWare since 2002

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.660
and was responsible for planning and support
of the initiative's technical infrastructure,

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.440
including software, hardware, networks and
technical standards used in the production

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.470
and delivery of MIT course materials to users
around the world.

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:52.950
She was named Executive Director of OCW in
September of 2008, with responsibility for

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.970
overall online courseware leadership.

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.160
Prior to her work with OCW, she co-founded
and served as Vice President of Operations

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.280
for SupplyWorks, a service provider for internet-based
manufacturing and procurement.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.240
And before that, she spent 13 years in a variety
of technology leadership positions at MIT,

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.530
including Director of Information Technology
Support and Director of Distributive Computing

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:14.530
and Network Services.

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.460
She is an MIT alum, Bachelor of Science in
Computer Science and Engineering, Class of

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.690
'77, and Master of Science in Management,
Class of '79.

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.420
And then, I would like to introduce Shigeru
Miyagawa.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.380
He's been at MIT since 1991, where he is Professor
of Linguistics and holds the endowed chair

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.799
Kochi-Manjiro Professor of Japanese Language
and Culture.

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:40.289
He runs a laboratory that creates interactive
educational programs.

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:46.170
And in line with this, he's also Chair of
MIT OpenCourseWare's Faculty Advisory Committee.

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:53.009
One of his innovations that I was quite interested
in is JP NET, which actually pre-dated OpenCourseWare

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.630
and the entire MIT Japanese program on the
web.

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.069
It was one of the first online projects in
the world to place an entire academic program

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:02.069
on the internet.

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:04.869
This was done from 1993 to 1994.

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:09.440
He received his Ph.D. in Linguistics from
the University of Arizona in 1980 and a BA

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.790
from the International Christian University
in Tokyo in 1975.

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.580
Please join me in welcoming both of our speakers
this evening.

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.330
[applause]

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.812
&gt;&gt;Cecilia Dâ€™Oliveira: Thank you.

00:02:26.812 --> 00:02:27.812
Thanks.

00:02:27.812 --> 00:02:28.812
Thank you very much, Scott.

00:02:28.812 --> 00:02:32.090
Shigeru and I talked about which one of us
would do the presentation and we could've

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.830
flipped a coin and he could've ended up up
here.

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.600
But I'm gonna do the presentation part of
tonight, which should take about 30 minutes,

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.250
if everything goes according to plan.

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:48.820
And then, we'll do a shared kind of Q and
A session, which we hope to leave you like,

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:49.980
30 minutes or something for--.

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.960
So, I'm sure you all have lots and lots of
questions.

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.840
And that'll be a lot more fun than sitting
there and listening to me.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:04.010
Let me start, first of all, by thanking people
who helped make this event happen.

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:12.980
The MIT Club of New York folks, for example,
many of whom are in the audience here, Greg

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:21.290
Martin, from Google, who's in the club, Yu-Hui
Lin, Scott, who just introduced me and several

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:22.290
others.

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.650
And I'd like to thank the club very much for
hosting us here.

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.060
I also wanna thank Google.

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.780
This is an amazing facility.

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:35.510
This room itself is amazing, but I got a quick
tour from Greg beforehand and what a wonderful

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.200
place to work.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.040
I'm very jealous.

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:48.170
And I'd like to thank Stu Feldman, who's back
there, for his nice introduction.

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.690
And the MIT staff who helped put it on, too.

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.040
Wherever you are, Yvonne, I hope you're up
here now.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.510
And Tom.

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.300
So, and thank all of you who are here tonight.

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:02.100
We have an interesting mixed audience.

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:11.040
I wanna start by saying that if you're an
MIT alum, can you raise your hand so we see?

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.340
If you are a Google employee, could you raise
your hand?

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.009
So, there's some overlap there.

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:25.669
If you're an OCW donor, you don't have to
raise your hand, but you can if you want to.

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:27.490
[laughter]

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.319
Terrific.

00:04:29.319 --> 00:04:32.419
Welcome all of you tonight and thank you for
being here.

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:42.439
So, what I wanted to do before I get into
my actual presentation, is start with my own

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:48.580
personal thoughts on why this is important,
why I think MIT's commitment to openness,

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:53.909
which has been expressed in a very specific
way through OpenCourseWare, is more important

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:57.120
than ever in terms of what's going on with
education.

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.210
And it's what makes my job at OpenCourseWare
so fulfilling.

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:03.409
And I'll start by just a couple of facts.

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:09.979
First thing is, worldwide demand for higher
education has been accelerating for the last

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:10.979
20 years.

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:19.960
Between 2001, when we announced OCW, and 2010,
enrollments in higher education grew by 60

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:24.840
percent, from about 100 million to about 160
million, driven largely by growth in the developing

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:25.840
world.

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:31.580
In China, for example, growth in higher education
has been in the neighborhood of about 20 percent

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:35.199
per year every year for the last decade.

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:43.000
Access, though, to quality higher education
is severely limited in developing countries

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.699
where we're seeing so much growth.

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:46.159
And India's a prime example of that.

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:52.300
I mean, of the population in India today,
there's 1.2 billion or something like that.

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:57.789
Half of them are under the age of 25.

00:05:57.789 --> 00:05:59.110
And if you look into--.

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:03.520
You think about the economy in India, which
is growing, there's a lot of people in the

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:06.250
middle coming into the middle class.

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:10.430
But the universities there--the traditional
universities there--can only handle about

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:15.830
ten percent of the people who could potentially
go.

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:21.439
Many of those institutions are facing the
inability to teach subjects that people wanna

00:06:21.439 --> 00:06:24.379
take 'cause they don't have qualified teachers.

00:06:24.379 --> 00:06:30.889
Within the comparable universities in India
to MIT are the IITs, the Indian Institutes

00:06:30.889 --> 00:06:33.370
of Technology.

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:36.059
Fantastic institutions that are spread across
the country.

00:06:36.059 --> 00:06:39.820
Their acceptance rate is less than two percent.

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:42.960
MIT's acceptance rate is more like--.

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:44.540
What is it, Shigeru?

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:46.840
Six percent?

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:50.719
The Ivy's are six to eight percent.

00:06:50.719 --> 00:06:56.500
And the pool that that is going against is
a pool of a half a million kids who have taken

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:58.889
the exam and passed it.

00:06:58.889 --> 00:07:01.289
So, it's not just anybody.

00:07:01.289 --> 00:07:04.659
It's these kids who have studied for a couple
of years and they take the exam.

00:07:04.659 --> 00:07:09.819
And still, only two percent of them can get
into the best institutes.

00:07:09.819 --> 00:07:17.710
So, what can we be doing to help all of these
capable young students get access to quality

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:20.509
education?

00:07:20.509 --> 00:07:25.559
Even in the US today, where we have significant
access to education, we have to do things

00:07:25.559 --> 00:07:26.559
better.

00:07:26.559 --> 00:07:32.409
I mean, we know that the percentages of students
who are not graduating from college are amazingly

00:07:32.409 --> 00:07:34.349
high.

00:07:34.349 --> 00:07:40.240
And we have a severe and growing shortage
of students who are majoring in engineering

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:42.680
and other STEM fields.

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:48.379
And then finally, lifelong learning has become
something that's really important to all of

00:07:48.379 --> 00:07:49.379
us.

00:07:49.379 --> 00:07:56.810
And in mature economies, more important, certainly
essential, I would say.

00:07:56.810 --> 00:08:00.350
Whether you're trying to maintain your skills,
you're trying to change careers, you're trying

00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:06.629
to get back in the workforce after being unemployed,
you just want to explore new areas of interest.

00:08:06.629 --> 00:08:08.770
Whatever it is, I mean, and I'll give you--.

00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:16.469
We have a number of examples of folks who
are fairly well-known, who have used OpenCourseWare

00:08:16.469 --> 00:08:22.860
to come back and study energy because it's
a hot field and they wanna know about it.

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:27.020
And the person I'm talking about is Bill Gates.

00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:29.169
[laughter]

00:08:29.169 --> 00:08:33.039
Most of the people in these situations don't
have the time to go back and get formal education.

00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:36.550
So again, what can we do to better serve that
population?

00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:43.089
These are some of the opportunities that we
have before us now where open sharing, I think,

00:08:43.089 --> 00:08:44.860
can make a difference.

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:50.060
And this is what, to me, makes OCW such a
fulfilling project to be part of.

00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:55.060
So, tonight what I wanna do is just review
with you OCW's first decade.

00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:57.690
What are the major things we think we've accomplished?

00:08:57.690 --> 00:09:05.870
And then, move into a little bit of an overview
of what's going on now in different places

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:11.970
to try to take, to go from open content to
what I'll call open learning, to actually

00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:18.690
create quality online learning experiences
that are openly available to people at the

00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:22.090
level of magnitude that OCW has been.

00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:26.529
We're learning about what it's gonna take
to do that.

00:09:26.529 --> 00:09:27.589
And that's quite exciting.

00:09:27.589 --> 00:09:32.209
And then I'll close by talking about what
the future of open education is at MIT, at

00:09:32.209 --> 00:09:37.930
least as far as we know today, including a
few words about the announcement about a month

00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:42.930
ago about MITx and what OCW's plans are for
the next decade.

00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:49.800
And as far as all that goes, Shigeru and I
had scheduled this event before the announcement.

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:55.009
And so, this wasn't intended to be like, some
big announcement about MITx today.

00:09:55.009 --> 00:09:58.430
And we, in fact, are not really the MITx people
at MIT.

00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:03.560
But we can tell you what we know and if you
have specific questions, we can figure out

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:05.310
how to answer those.

00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:11.100
So, moving along quickly here, you're all
familiar with the idea that MIT came up with

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:16.190
back in the year 2000, and Shigeru was part
of a very small committee, that looked at

00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:20.230
what MIT could do to put itself on the internet.

00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:25.800
They concluded that doing some kind of an
MIT dot com was not the way to go.

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:32.480
That putting our courses online in a way that
would be consistent with MIT quality was just

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:33.649
too, it would be too expensive.

00:10:33.649 --> 00:10:38.350
And at that point in time, we had no idea
how to do it.

00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:41.030
But we did wanna have a presence on the net.

00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:45.770
And so, the idea that they came up with was,
"Let's just give all the materials from our

00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:47.410
existing courses away.

00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:48.829
Let's not do anything special.

00:10:48.829 --> 00:10:51.140
Let's just put them all up."

00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:53.660
And that was the very simple idea.

00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:56.160
But it was pretty revolutionary.

00:10:56.160 --> 00:11:01.730
A lot of people felt as though it was crazy
for an academic institution to give away intellectual

00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:03.480
assets.

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:07.500
But in fact, it's very consistent with what
the mission is of MIT.

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:13.009
And for those of you who are MIT grads, MIT's
mission has been consistent for the entire

00:11:13.009 --> 00:11:15.519
time I've been there.

00:11:15.519 --> 00:11:18.459
And that's been a number of years.

00:11:18.459 --> 00:11:23.829
I have a lot of grey hair that I didn't have
when I first came to MIT.

00:11:23.829 --> 00:11:29.259
But the mission is to advance knowledge and
to educate students to serve the nation in

00:11:29.259 --> 00:11:30.259
the world.

00:11:30.259 --> 00:11:36.440
And so, doing something like OpenCourseWare
is just absolutely consistent with the mission.

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:40.970
And I think the committee that came up with
the idea drew heavily on the MIT mission in

00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:42.500
terms of the idea.

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:48.980
And as Susan Hockfield, our current President,
says, "OCW expresses MIT's goal of advancing

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:52.760
education through a global community."

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:58.970
And so, if we look at the goals of OCW, number
one it was to help educators and learners

00:11:58.970 --> 00:12:00.540
by sharing our materials.

00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:03.920
But the second thing was to encourage other
universities to do this.

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:08.660
Our idea at the beginning wasn't that people
would just take MIT courses and adopt them

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:09.660
everywhere.

00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:15.029
I think some people initially had that misinterpretation
that somehow, we were trying to take over

00:12:15.029 --> 00:12:18.779
the world of education by enforcing our approach.

00:12:18.779 --> 00:12:21.850
But our idea was basically to set a model.

00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:27.060
And the model would be based on this idea
of openness and advancement through sharing

00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:32.759
of ideas, sharing of knowledge.

00:12:32.759 --> 00:12:37.339
And what we didn't say at the time, but what
was certainly very much discussed behind the

00:12:37.339 --> 00:12:43.519
scenes, was that by encouraging our faculty
to put their materials online, that it would--I

00:12:43.519 --> 00:12:49.850
won't say force them--but it would encourage
them to take things and dust them off and

00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:57.130
update them and make them look better because
it was gonna have their name on it.

00:12:57.130 --> 00:13:01.350
So, you all know OCW doesn't provide online
courses.

00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:04.670
We provide the material that comes out of
classes.

00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:10.470
And that repository, if you want to think
of it as a virtual library of course materials,

00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:12.220
has grown and grown and grown.

00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:16.389
We have materials of all different types.

00:13:16.389 --> 00:13:19.850
We started with largely tech/space content.

00:13:19.850 --> 00:13:26.380
And over time, as it became clear that video
was really, really popular and helped people

00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:33.459
really understand the content better, we've
put resources in to video lecture capture.

00:13:33.459 --> 00:13:38.029
But we basically take whatever the faculty
gives us.

00:13:38.029 --> 00:13:41.690
There's a lot of variety in the course materials
we provide.

00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:43.920
Some courses have very little.

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:47.940
Some courses are extremely rich with material.

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:51.009
And that's really a function of several different
things.

00:13:51.009 --> 00:13:55.000
Intellectual property issues is one of the
big things that we face.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.069
If it's property that isn't owned by MIT or
the faculty member, we really can't publish

00:14:00.069 --> 00:14:01.160
it.

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:04.020
But there are also faculty references that
come into play.

00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:06.680
Some faculty want to publish everything.

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:08.970
Others don't.

00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:10.089
And the type of course.

00:14:10.089 --> 00:14:14.630
We found in the Humanities areas, it's very
difficult, especially in seminar-type courses,

00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:18.040
to really put those online without any interaction.

00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:21.040
The materials themselves really aren't that
useful.

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:24.080
But we do what we can do.

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:26.660
Everything's available and this is a critical
part of what we do.

00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:29.709
We're not just putting stuff up for people
to look at for free.

00:14:29.709 --> 00:14:34.600
We're putting it up with an open, what has
now become known as Creative Commons license,

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:40.741
which allows for the legal reuse, redistribution,
copying, basically do what you want, with

00:14:40.741 --> 00:14:41.741
a few restrictions.

00:14:41.741 --> 00:14:44.970
And one of the major ones is non-commercial.

00:14:44.970 --> 00:14:48.899
We were one of the first major institutions
to adopt the Creative Commons license.

00:14:48.899 --> 00:14:53.560
It's now widely used, not just in education,
but in a variety of fields.

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:58.380
So, we began publishing our courses in 2002.

00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:00.970
As Stu said, this is an ongoing operation.

00:15:00.970 --> 00:15:05.140
We have people that are back in the offices
as we speak, who are working on publishing

00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:07.480
our next set of courses.

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:10.220
We now have 21 hundred courses online.

00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:15.290
We have hundreds that we've taken offline
and archived.

00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:23.880
And this is something that MIT has committed
to keep running into the future permanently.

00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:27.259
OK.

00:15:27.259 --> 00:15:31.470
The costs of OCW have always been an issue.

00:15:31.470 --> 00:15:34.199
People have said, "How does MIT pay for this?"

00:15:34.199 --> 00:15:37.980
The operation costs about four million dollars
a year.

00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:43.680
It's paid for through these various revenue
streams--individual donors.

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:50.699
We have an amazing annual fund with the kind
of program where people make online donations.

00:15:50.699 --> 00:15:54.149
Last year, we got nearly 25 hundred donations
that way.

00:15:54.149 --> 00:15:56.959
And they range from a dollar a month to--.

00:15:56.959 --> 00:16:01.100
Somebody actually did an online donation of
like, 50 thousand dollars one time.

00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:03.079
That was pretty amazing.

00:16:03.079 --> 00:16:05.889
We also have corporate sponsors.

00:16:05.889 --> 00:16:11.750
We have foundations that give us money, typically
for projects to do enhancements to the site.

00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:17.459
We have a small amount, we're trying to grow
this, of revenue from places like Amazon,

00:16:17.459 --> 00:16:22.320
referrals, ad revenues, and that sort.

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:27.759
And then, MIT sort of makes up everything
else, which right now is about half of our

00:16:27.759 --> 00:16:29.879
costs.

00:16:29.879 --> 00:16:33.139
So, we have a global audience.

00:16:33.139 --> 00:16:39.980
I think the MIT community continues to be
amazed at the numbers of people that come

00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:41.040
to our website.

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:44.850
We're the most visited website at the institute.

00:16:44.850 --> 00:16:49.240
We now have between 1.5 and 2 million visits
a month.

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:51.259
A lot of those are repeat visitors.

00:16:51.259 --> 00:16:53.949
Probably about 50 percent of the people are
people coming back.

00:16:53.949 --> 00:16:56.939
So, people are finding a lot of value.

00:16:56.939 --> 00:17:02.769
Our traffic has grown year by year.

00:17:02.769 --> 00:17:07.839
Last year, we reached almost 19 million in
visits total.

00:17:07.839 --> 00:17:12.890
And as you can see from the chart up there,
there's an awful lot of traffic that comes

00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:15.470
outside of North America.

00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:20.500
The MIT traffic is a very small part of traffic
to our site.

00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:29.309
Areas like East Asia, China, Korea, end up
being about 20 percent of our overall traffic.

00:17:29.309 --> 00:17:30.480
That's been pretty consistent.

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:35.410
Now, these numbers don't include offline ways
that we distribute our content.

00:17:35.410 --> 00:17:39.890
We have a mirror site program where we take
content and distribute it on hard drives.

00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:44.490
We have about 300 sites around the world that
run OpenCourseWare on a local server that

00:17:44.490 --> 00:17:47.539
way because of internet bandwidth issues.

00:17:47.539 --> 00:17:54.070
We also have sites--translation sites--that
have translated our content in different languages.

00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:55.860
They run their own servers.

00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:58.880
They have their own users that come there.

00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:01.200
Those aren't included in our numbers.

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:03.880
We also put our content up on places like
YouTube.

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:06.070
And thank you very much Google.

00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:10.760
That has saved us a huge amount of money in
terms of bandwidth over the last few years.

00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:11.760
That was--.

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:16.610
One of my major concerns as Technology Director
in 2005 was how are we gonna keep up with

00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:18.830
all this video traffic?

00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:19.990
And then YouTube came along.

00:18:19.990 --> 00:18:22.730
And that was a wonderful solution.

00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:27.620
Traffic through YouTube and iTunes and places
like that where we put our video is also not

00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:29.419
included here in terms of visits.

00:18:29.419 --> 00:18:32.980
So, this is a minimal picture in terms of
things.

00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:37.830
As we added all this stuff up in terms of
who has access and how do they have access,

00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:45.180
we think that between 2001 and the end of
2011, we got about 100 million people who

00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:50.279
access the content and used it in one shape
or form or another.

00:18:50.279 --> 00:18:57.480
And so at MIT, that is something that we are
truly humbled by and certainly never expected.

00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:02.760
Now, the impact of OCW has been both in the
formal learning side of things--.

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:07.260
And what I mean by that is where you teachers
and students and maybe the teachers are using

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:12.610
the content to expand their own knowledge,
students are using some of OCW for supplementing

00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:14.400
their courses.

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:19.470
In some cases, teachers adopt our materials
and integrate it in their class.

00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:25.659
But a lot of times, they're just looking at
what we have and how we teach to let that

00:19:25.659 --> 00:19:27.600
inform how they're gonna teach their course.

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:35.700
So, there's a wide variety of ways that informal
teaching and learning, OCW gets used.

00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:43.570
What has been most amazing, though, in terms
of use, is the informal learning side of OCW.

00:19:43.570 --> 00:19:48.730
We had no concept when we started the project
that this site would be as heavily used as

00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:52.380
it is by people who aren't formally taking
a course anywhere.

00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:54.700
These were just raw materials.

00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:58.690
These weren't materials that were prepared
for online use.

00:19:58.690 --> 00:20:01.620
And yet, people found value in them.

00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:06.299
Forty-three percent of our users--the largest
segment of our user base--it turns out are

00:20:06.299 --> 00:20:08.590
informal users.

00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:11.049
Absolutely amazing.

00:20:11.049 --> 00:20:16.480
And this is a statistic that has been replicated
as new OCW sites opened up at other schools,

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:18.220
which I'll talk about in a minute.

00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:20.100
This is a statistic that's been replicated.

00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:24.470
So, informal learning, there's a huge demand
out there.

00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:28.710
And I think over the last ten years as the
internet has grown, people have become familiar

00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:30.170
with things like Wikipedia.

00:20:30.170 --> 00:20:32.900
It's just the first place people go for information.

00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:40.590
And for lifelong learners, OCW kinds of scenarios
fit in very well.

00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:46.510
So, one of our goals, I think I mentioned
early on, was that we would not be the only

00:20:46.510 --> 00:20:50.240
institution adopting this idea of openness
and sharing.

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:56.159
And in fact, very quickly, we had institutions
that MIT had close relationships with that

00:20:56.159 --> 00:20:58.010
came and said, "What are you doing?

00:20:58.010 --> 00:20:59.130
How do you do it?

00:20:59.130 --> 00:21:00.320
We wanna do this, too.

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:02.549
We think it's a great idea."

00:21:02.549 --> 00:21:07.140
And we started working together and figuring
out how to do things better and sharing best

00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:08.630
practices.

00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:13.710
And this eventually turned into something
that we call the OCW Consortium.

00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:20.010
It's an independent organization now-- its
own board of directors, its own staff.

00:21:20.010 --> 00:21:24.169
It has about 250 member institutions that
pay dues.

00:21:24.169 --> 00:21:31.250
And if you look across those sites, MIT was
the model, but we have sites doing all kinds

00:21:31.250 --> 00:21:34.270
of different, really amazing things.

00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:44.240
And there are about 15 thousand courses up
there in different languages.

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:48.130
One of the things Shigeru was very involved
in was one of the first regional consortiums

00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:53.309
that set up schools within Japan, came together,
I don't know what year it was.

00:21:53.309 --> 00:21:55.780
Maybe 2005, 2006.

00:21:55.780 --> 00:21:59.279
Ten of the leading institutions there formed
a Japanese Consortium.

00:21:59.279 --> 00:22:05.880
There's now regional OCW consortia in Korea
and Taiwan as well.

00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:11.580
And the consortium has been great 'cause it's
provided a collaborative way for various schools

00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:13.470
to get together and work on projects.

00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:16.110
An example of that right now is happening
in Europe.

00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:21.491
They have this thing called the Bologna Process,
where the EU is trying to integrate some of

00:22:21.491 --> 00:22:24.980
the educational stuff going on in higher education.

00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:28.071
And one of the things they're trying to do
is something called "student mobility," so

00:22:28.071 --> 00:22:32.900
it's easier for students to move across borders
and from school to school.

00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:37.710
A bunch of the OCW universities in Europe
have come together to try to figure out, "How

00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:43.220
can we use our OCW curriculum to actually
make this happen?"

00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:45.399
And that's a very exciting project.

00:22:45.399 --> 00:22:48.020
Now, one of the things that happened along
the way.

00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:53.240
We were doing OpenCourseWare and then, all
kinds of things started happening that we

00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:55.440
didn't anticipate.

00:22:55.440 --> 00:23:00.909
And we became the spark for something that
became known as the Open Educational Resources

00:23:00.909 --> 00:23:01.940
movement.

00:23:01.940 --> 00:23:04.390
This is a broader movement than OCW.

00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:09.500
It includes organizations that aren't even
academic institutions.

00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:12.140
It includes individuals.

00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:15.529
It's a term that was first adopted in 2002
by UNESCO.

00:23:15.529 --> 00:23:20.850
They held a forum to look at what the impact
of OpenCourseWare would be in higher education.

00:23:20.850 --> 00:23:22.870
They came up with this term.

00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:25.640
It includes all kinds of materials.

00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:27.340
It includes software, services.

00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:31.190
It includes things like the licensing framework
from Creative Commons.

00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:37.290
And it has really been nurtured and grown
through the Hewlett Foundation, grants, and

00:23:37.290 --> 00:23:39.700
targeted programs.

00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:46.500
So, if you look at the OER Movement, I just
went out and collected a bunch of the logos

00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:53.610
from some of the most well-known institutions
that are part of OER, and you'll see it includes

00:23:53.610 --> 00:24:00.149
both educational institutions and it includes
some educational institutions that aren't

00:24:00.149 --> 00:24:06.660
even part of the OCW Movement, formally, like
Yale and Stanford, where they're sharing stuff,

00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:09.610
but they're really not part of the Consortium.

00:24:09.610 --> 00:24:14.559
It includes groups that formed specifically
to translate the content.

00:24:14.559 --> 00:24:18.880
It includes groups that have funded a lot
of this work.

00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:19.880
It includes--.

00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:23.740
Some are strictly policy-making institutions,
like UNESCO.

00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:25.880
It includes some for-profit companies.

00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:33.790
I mean, I consider YouTube and iTunes and
OpenStudy and Flat World, all of these for-profit

00:24:33.790 --> 00:24:40.630
companies that are helping us make this movement
happen to be part of--and they're providing

00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:43.940
free services to do it--they're part of the
movement.

00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:50.330
There's NGOs like the African Health OER Network.

00:24:50.330 --> 00:24:55.760
There are small entrepreneurial start-ups,
like Peer-to-Peer University.

00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:58.110
And it goes on and on and on.

00:24:58.110 --> 00:24:59.559
It's a very fertile time.

00:24:59.559 --> 00:25:05.600
Within the US, a lot of this OER energy has
been focused on things like the cost of textbooks

00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:09.659
and what can we do with open resources to
drive down the cost of textbooks?

00:25:09.659 --> 00:25:15.010
And so, we have Flat World Knowledge and we
have an initiative in California to develop

00:25:15.010 --> 00:25:17.250
free and open textbooks.

00:25:17.250 --> 00:25:23.460
The State of Washington invested in the development
of 80 open courses, which are largely trying

00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:26.860
to do away with textbooks.

00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:31.730
And finally, in terms of the movement, there's
national governments like India, like the

00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:36.980
Netherlands, like Korea, who are actually
incorporating the idea of open educational

00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:40.460
resources in their national education policy.

00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:44.559
So, we've accomplished a lot in the last ten
years.

00:25:44.559 --> 00:25:51.159
I mean, if you step back and you look at where
we've been, we've helped millions and millions

00:25:51.159 --> 00:25:52.809
of learners.

00:25:52.809 --> 00:25:59.640
And as I said, in an environment where a large
portion of the world's population doesn't

00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:05.500
have access to quality higher education, and
when lifelong learning has become in larger

00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:13.000
and larger demand, OCW has been an answer
in some ways.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:14.230
We've supported educators.

00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:19.179
We've helped high school educators develop
better understanding of math.

00:26:19.179 --> 00:26:23.029
We've helped other educators who are trying
to figure out, they've got to teach a course

00:26:23.029 --> 00:26:26.900
for the first time, how should they do it?

00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:33.870
This was our primary target and that is absolutely
one of the things that we have fulfilled.

00:26:33.870 --> 00:26:38.540
We've supported flexible lifelong learning,
whether it's a working professional, it's

00:26:38.540 --> 00:26:43.769
a non-traditional student like a homeschooler,
it's someone who has had a lot of trouble

00:26:43.769 --> 00:26:49.950
working in a formal classroom, but finds it
a lot easier to work online at their own pace.

00:26:49.950 --> 00:26:54.610
We've had entrepreneurs who are trying to
look for reference material.

00:26:54.610 --> 00:27:00.020
One of my favorite cases is a guy from Haiti
who's developing some solar panels and needed

00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:03.470
some information on integrated circuits.

00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:07.809
And he didn't have a library in Haiti, but
he did have OpenCourseWare.

00:27:07.809 --> 00:27:12.000
And the final two things.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:19.220
I think we have created a model for government,
for institutions, for individuals in terms

00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:21.600
of open sharing.

00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:22.600
So much is underway.

00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:27.240
And I've talked about a lot of that already,
so I won't go into that now.

00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:33.150
And finally, and I think this is really where
we get most exciting, is that through having

00:27:33.150 --> 00:27:40.669
open content out there, we've inspired a lot
of experiments in open education to try to

00:27:40.669 --> 00:27:46.740
figure out how to take the content and turn
it into a quality online experience.

00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:53.360
And we'll talk about some of these experiments
in a minute.

00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:56.140
So, we've done this thing with OpenCourseWare.

00:27:56.140 --> 00:27:57.809
It's been ten years.

00:27:57.809 --> 00:28:04.690
So, what's the next big opportunity for open
education?

00:28:04.690 --> 00:28:12.169
And I would say these projects, which I've
had to go through and pick out just a handful

00:28:12.169 --> 00:28:15.380
of them that I could fit on a slide, these
projects are some of the projects I think

00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:20.720
that have done the most to try to take open
content into open learning.

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:24.030
Khan Academy you're all familiar with.

00:28:24.030 --> 00:28:29.860
Something that went online in 2006, is now
serving about four million visitors a month,

00:28:29.860 --> 00:28:36.860
a couple thousand video tutorials, has really
established a model for how you can effectively

00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:42.200
teach online in a modular kind of way.

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:46.510
Integrated exercises to help people check
whether or not they know what they're doing.

00:28:46.510 --> 00:28:53.550
So, that's been an extremely interesting project
that we've been watching and I think we've

00:28:53.550 --> 00:28:59.880
learned a lot from that about how you could
adapt content to make the whole experience

00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:00.880
better.

00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:05.770
The CMU Open Learning Initiative is another
amazing one, was founded actually in 2001,

00:29:05.770 --> 00:29:07.730
right around the same time as OCW.

00:29:07.730 --> 00:29:13.340
It's a group of learning scientists who work
with experts to put together online courses

00:29:13.340 --> 00:29:17.360
that have been designed with all the best
learning in science.

00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:22.840
It's expensive, but what they've done is modeled
for us how do you really create an effective

00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:28.890
online experience, something that can be as
effective as in class.

00:29:28.890 --> 00:29:33.460
And that means what we've learned from them
is assessment--continual assessment, continual

00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:37.929
feedback--to people online is really important.

00:29:37.929 --> 00:29:43.470
OpenStudy is a very small group that started
a couple years ago that is providing free

00:29:43.470 --> 00:29:49.390
student study groups online where students
who maybe are using OpenCourseWare can ask

00:29:49.390 --> 00:29:54.490
each other questions, answer other questions,
basically interact with people.

00:29:54.490 --> 00:29:59.570
And they're experimenting with things like
badges to inspire people and to recognize

00:29:59.570 --> 00:30:04.139
people for their contributions in an open
learning kind of environment.

00:30:04.139 --> 00:30:07.350
We've hooked up a number of our courses to
OpenStudy.

00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:14.399
Peer-to-Peer University is a bunch of people--volunteers--who
take open content and teach courses to anyone

00:30:14.399 --> 00:30:15.399
who wants to take it.

00:30:15.399 --> 00:30:17.260
And it's on a variety of topics.

00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:21.220
A lot of them are web-based kinds of things.

00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:23.799
But that's been interesting because it's really
peer-to-peer.

00:30:23.799 --> 00:30:25.230
It's not necessarily expert-led.

00:30:25.230 --> 00:30:31.159
What we've learned there is that moderated
peer groups can actually be quite effective

00:30:31.159 --> 00:30:32.179
in learning.

00:30:32.179 --> 00:30:36.100
They're doing a lot with badges right now
to try to figure out, again, how those can

00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:40.929
be used to certify mastery in an online setting.

00:30:40.929 --> 00:30:44.139
And then the final one I'll talk about briefly.

00:30:44.139 --> 00:30:49.919
I'm sure most of you heard about the Stanford
courses that went online in the fall.

00:30:49.919 --> 00:30:50.919
Yes?

00:30:50.919 --> 00:31:00.130
Got announced [chuckles] last August or something
that they were gonna open up some courses

00:31:00.130 --> 00:31:04.110
that they had been teaching at Stanford with
Stanford students.

00:31:04.110 --> 00:31:08.710
They were gonna redesign them, open them up
for free online use to anybody who wanted.

00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:16.330
They had 160 thousand people register for
the AI-Lab course, for the AI course, in a

00:31:16.330 --> 00:31:19.730
very quick period of time--several weeks.

00:31:19.730 --> 00:31:25.549
It turns out about 20 thousand students actually
finished that course successfully, from what

00:31:25.549 --> 00:31:26.549
I understand.

00:31:26.549 --> 00:31:34.389
And the most amazing thing is that there were
200 students in the course that scored perfectly

00:31:34.389 --> 00:31:36.580
on the exams.

00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:38.509
And I don't know if that includes the homework.

00:31:38.509 --> 00:31:42.309
Whatever it was, 200 students had perfect
scores.

00:31:42.309 --> 00:31:47.090
All of them were online learners, not the
students at Stanford who were taking the class

00:31:47.090 --> 00:31:48.640
simultaneously.

00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:50.409
That is amazing.

00:31:50.409 --> 00:31:57.159
And I think what it is is a lot of the content
they have--short video tutorials online--students

00:31:57.159 --> 00:32:01.730
can go back and do them again and again and
again, until they get it.

00:32:01.730 --> 00:32:06.149
A Stanford student doesn't have time to do
that, I don't think.

00:32:06.149 --> 00:32:12.049
So, what we learned is there's a huge interest
there for this kind of course, especially

00:32:12.049 --> 00:32:17.820
when it's being taught by fairly well-known
experts in the field with a name like Stanford

00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:19.400
associated with it.

00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:25.669
We also learned that the, again, having the
ability to take tests and get your stuff graded

00:32:25.669 --> 00:32:29.419
was really important.

00:32:29.419 --> 00:32:32.919
And they got a certificate, although it wasn't
signed by Stanford, I don't think.

00:32:32.919 --> 00:32:35.960
But I think people like that as well.

00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:40.679
The only question I have about this is, and
I just need to have a conversation with folks

00:32:40.679 --> 00:32:45.450
at Stanford to confirm this, it's a free course,
but it wasn't clear to me the content was

00:32:45.450 --> 00:32:46.450
open.

00:32:46.450 --> 00:32:51.799
It wasn't clear to me that people could take
the content, maybe put it on their own server,

00:32:51.799 --> 00:32:54.070
teach their own course with it.

00:32:54.070 --> 00:32:55.280
That would be the optimal.

00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:57.940
That would be where we would like to have
things go.

00:32:57.940 --> 00:33:01.330
But it was a fantastic effort.

00:33:01.330 --> 00:33:03.630
So, finishing up here.

00:33:03.630 --> 00:33:10.380
So, the question that I have before us now
is the issue of scaling.

00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:14.299
Publishing of OpenCourseWare has been a very
scalable thing.

00:33:14.299 --> 00:33:16.700
We take course materials from MIT.

00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:18.059
We prep them for the web.

00:33:18.059 --> 00:33:19.059
We put them online.

00:33:19.059 --> 00:33:22.270
It costs us about ten to 15 thousand dollars.

00:33:22.270 --> 00:33:27.789
Sounds like a lot, but when millions of people
use the resources, it's actually very cost

00:33:27.789 --> 00:33:28.789
effective.

00:33:28.789 --> 00:33:34.289
The problem is how do you teach and how do
you really get the learning to scale like

00:33:34.289 --> 00:33:35.440
that?

00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:38.919
Really, two questions.

00:33:38.919 --> 00:33:42.230
How do you construct a quality online learning
experience?

00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:47.110
And two, how do you scale it so the costs
don't just go out of the ceiling?

00:33:47.110 --> 00:33:52.009
And what, I think, we found from these experiments
and others is that you need content design

00:33:52.009 --> 00:33:53.009
for online.

00:33:53.009 --> 00:33:54.549
You need it to be modular.

00:33:54.549 --> 00:33:57.230
You need interactive resources.

00:33:57.230 --> 00:34:03.070
In the case of the Open Learning Initiative
at CMU, they actually have an online tutor

00:34:03.070 --> 00:34:07.120
that guides people, navigates them, gives
them frequent feedback.

00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:09.589
Very helpful to learners online.

00:34:09.589 --> 00:34:11.480
You wanna have interactive simulations.

00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:17.030
You wanna have, from an MIT perspective, you
wanna have online labs.

00:34:17.030 --> 00:34:20.929
The interactive components are really important.

00:34:20.929 --> 00:34:23.810
And that also includes interactive online
communities.

00:34:23.810 --> 00:34:26.810
That was one thing, I think, about the Stanford
Project that was really good.

00:34:26.810 --> 00:34:32.389
They had all kinds of ways for people to interact
with each other and work through the material.

00:34:32.389 --> 00:34:36.780
That'll be essential in building scaled learning
environments.

00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:41.960
You need a delivery platform that's gonna
scale to millions, or at least to thousands

00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:44.810
and hundreds of thousands of simultaneous
users.

00:34:44.810 --> 00:34:48.609
And optimally, from a learner's point of view,
you wanna have some kind of credential that's

00:34:48.609 --> 00:34:50.669
gonna recognize all the work they did.

00:34:50.669 --> 00:34:53.919
So, where does that lead us to?

00:34:53.919 --> 00:34:56.099
So, December 19th.

00:34:56.099 --> 00:35:00.200
MIT announced something called MITx.

00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:06.480
And the announcement said we're gonna offer
free online courses and make learning tools

00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:08.760
freely available.

00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:14.460
This is an initiative that's been under discussion
in different forms for a couple of years.

00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:20.030
The announcement was made at the end of the
year for a number of different reasons.

00:35:20.030 --> 00:35:22.890
Work is underway now.

00:35:22.890 --> 00:35:29.660
There will be some initial pilot courses launched
this spring at some point.

00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:32.730
The project is being led by our provost.

00:35:32.730 --> 00:35:38.660
The development of the learning platform that's
gonna be part of this is being done by the

00:35:38.660 --> 00:35:42.910
director of our Computer Science and Artificial
Intelligence Lab, Professor Agarwal.

00:35:42.910 --> 00:35:45.100
Many of you know him.

00:35:45.100 --> 00:35:50.260
The components of this that have been announced
are very much in line with what I went through

00:35:50.260 --> 00:35:56.609
when I said, "What would it take to really
scale and create a quality online experience?"

00:35:56.609 --> 00:36:00.500
It's gonna have self-paced materials, very
modularized.

00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:05.680
There's gonna be interactivity built in, both
in terms of the learning resources as well

00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:07.190
as a virtual community.

00:36:07.190 --> 00:36:11.800
There's gonna be some automated assessment
of the work, so you don't have to have TAs

00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:12.800
grade things.

00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:15.230
You're gonna have automated ways of doing
that.

00:36:15.230 --> 00:36:17.710
And it's gonna be based on an Open Source
platform.

00:36:17.710 --> 00:36:22.880
And I think the idea here is to have a platform
that can be developed by people around the

00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:26.390
world and enhanced in a continuous development
way.

00:36:26.390 --> 00:36:28.750
Very much of an Open Source mentality.

00:36:28.750 --> 00:36:34.079
And then the big thing was they're gonna offer
something that's called an MITx Certificate.

00:36:34.079 --> 00:36:35.590
It won't be an MIT credit.

00:36:35.590 --> 00:36:38.000
It won't be an MIT certificate.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:45.690
But it will be something that is accredible,
verified in some way, certificate that says

00:36:45.690 --> 00:36:50.300
you learned what the course taught or what
the subject taught.

00:36:50.300 --> 00:36:56.790
So, the next decade, just to make clear, there's
gonna be three things going on at MIT.

00:36:56.790 --> 00:37:00.690
They're education-focused at a global level.

00:37:00.690 --> 00:37:08.570
There's regular MIT, selective admissions,
tuition, degrees, access to all of our wonderful

00:37:08.570 --> 00:37:10.900
facilities.

00:37:10.900 --> 00:37:13.200
Maybe we'll have online courses as part of
that.

00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:14.810
We'll see.

00:37:14.810 --> 00:37:21.890
Number two, OCW will continue as it is today,
which is providing MIT course materials openly

00:37:21.890 --> 00:37:24.250
for people to use.

00:37:24.250 --> 00:37:26.500
Free and open access.

00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:28.750
Continuing to update.

00:37:28.750 --> 00:37:34.130
And then finally, MITx, which is gonna be
really experimenting with what it means to

00:37:34.130 --> 00:37:43.000
offer online courses for thousands of people
at a time, providing quality learning experiences.

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:47.410
So, those three things will exist going forward.

00:37:47.410 --> 00:37:52.490
OCWs next decade I can talk about because
I'm responsible for that.

00:37:52.490 --> 00:37:54.590
I'm not responsible for MITx.

00:37:54.590 --> 00:37:57.670
And what I can tell you is we're gonna continue
to enhance our content.

00:37:57.670 --> 00:38:00.829
Video is gonna become more and more of what
we do.

00:38:00.829 --> 00:38:05.130
As faculty adopt different kinds of video
formats, those will be incorporated within

00:38:05.130 --> 00:38:06.900
our publication.

00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:09.490
We wanna grow our learning communities.

00:38:09.490 --> 00:38:12.300
We have learning communities set up through
OpenStudy.

00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:16.099
We wanna figure out ways to really grow those
and make those work.

00:38:16.099 --> 00:38:18.640
We'll be sharing OCW more widely.

00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:21.950
We've done it through YouTube and iTunes and
other places before.

00:38:21.950 --> 00:38:26.869
We think there's a big opportunity, say, with
Wikipedia taking some of our content in short

00:38:26.869 --> 00:38:31.810
form, integrating into Wikipedia articles
to get it out there.

00:38:31.810 --> 00:38:33.950
We've gotta figure out what our mobile strategy
is.

00:38:33.950 --> 00:38:37.319
And then, we'll continue to do what we've
done for the last several years, which is

00:38:37.319 --> 00:38:41.760
targeting groups, user groups, within OCW
that we think are really important whether

00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:50.430
it's high school students or teachers or self-learners
and trying to figure out how can we adapt

00:38:50.430 --> 00:38:55.130
ever so slightly what we do to present the
materials in a way that's more accessible

00:38:55.130 --> 00:38:58.230
and easy to use for those specific groups?

00:38:58.230 --> 00:39:02.010
So, that's basically my presentation.

00:39:02.010 --> 00:39:12.859
Let me close by saying that they say that
a journey of a thousand miles starts with

00:39:12.859 --> 00:39:13.859
a single step.

00:39:13.859 --> 00:39:18.020
And certainly with OCW, back in 2001, we took
a step.

00:39:18.020 --> 00:39:23.290
And what we have been on is a journey that
had a lot of surprises along the way.

00:39:23.290 --> 00:39:30.619
I don't think anybody here or at MIT could
have predicted what the impact was gonna be

00:39:30.619 --> 00:39:39.450
of OpenCourseWare or where we would be now
in 2012, announcing an online course initiative.

00:39:39.450 --> 00:39:44.730
With this announcement, I think we've started
a new journey in Open Sharing.

00:39:44.730 --> 00:39:47.770
And so all I can say is stay tuned.

00:39:47.770 --> 00:39:51.840
The adventure continues at MIT.

00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:55.910
Thanks very much and let's have some questions.

00:39:55.910 --> 00:39:57.650
[applause]

00:39:57.650 --> 00:40:05.050
&gt;&gt;Graham Wharton: I'd like to start by asking
people if you do have questions to come to

00:40:05.050 --> 00:40:06.050
the microphones.

00:40:06.050 --> 00:40:09.700
There's one here and there's one on the other
side of the room.

00:40:09.700 --> 00:40:15.560
And also, we have folks on video chat from
Irvine, from Mountain View, and from Cambridge,

00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:16.560
I believe.

00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:20.569
And so, if any of the folks on video chat--you
probably hear me right now--if you could please

00:40:20.569 --> 00:40:22.980
jump in between questions.

00:40:22.980 --> 00:40:25.000
And hopefully, you'll be acknowledged.

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:30.220
I want to start off the questions by saying,
well, a hundred million is pretty good and

00:40:30.220 --> 00:40:31.220
repeats.

00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:38.579
And you're probably closer to a billion now
by having courses translated to Spanish and

00:40:38.579 --> 00:40:39.900
Chinese, perhaps.

00:40:39.900 --> 00:40:45.150
I wanted to ask how close are you actually
already to the goal of one billion and what

00:40:45.150 --> 00:40:46.150
will it take to get there?

00:40:46.150 --> 00:40:47.770
&gt;&gt;Cecilia Dâ€™Oliveira: No, no, no, Graham.

00:40:47.770 --> 00:40:48.770
No.

00:40:48.770 --> 00:40:50.569
We're at the hundred million level.

00:40:50.569 --> 00:40:54.170
I mean, can we reach a billion?

00:40:54.170 --> 00:40:56.970
There's seven billion people in the world.

00:40:56.970 --> 00:40:59.329
What percentage of them can benefit from MIT?

00:40:59.329 --> 00:41:01.680
Maybe, I don't know, 500 million?

00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:04.490
I don't know a billion.

00:41:04.490 --> 00:41:06.890
That's out there really for impact more than
anything.

00:41:06.890 --> 00:41:09.540
But Shigeru, do you think we can get to a
billion?

00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:13.160
&gt;&gt;Shigeru Miyagawa: Well, maybe with the help
from other people.

00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:18.250
One thing that you mentioned that's important
is that we have the original CourseWare in

00:41:18.250 --> 00:41:19.350
English.

00:41:19.350 --> 00:41:20.980
That's what MIT offers.

00:41:20.980 --> 00:41:24.530
But we also have translation sites in Spanish,
Portuguese, Chinese, what else?

00:41:24.530 --> 00:41:25.640
&gt;&gt;Cecilia Dâ€™Oliveira: Turkish.

00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:26.760
&gt;&gt;Shigeru Miyagawa: Turkish.

00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:27.760
Thai.

00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:28.760
&gt;&gt;Cecilia Dâ€™Oliveira: Persian.

00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:34.140
&gt;&gt;Shigeru Miyagawa: And those sites get a
fairly large number of access as well.

00:41:34.140 --> 00:41:38.490
And we hope to grow that to other languages.

00:41:38.490 --> 00:41:43.220
But our hope, right now, we have a hundred
million people who have used OpenCourseWare

00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:49.200
in the past ten years, which, by the way,
for those of us who are in the original committee,

00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:50.869
we had absolutely no idea.

00:41:50.869 --> 00:41:55.420
Absolutely no idea that it would be this big
a thing.

00:41:55.420 --> 00:41:58.670
But our hope is to go from a hundred million
to a billion.

00:41:58.670 --> 00:42:05.220
And to go from here to there, very clearly,
we need to collaborate with other people,

00:42:05.220 --> 00:42:08.599
hopefully such as Google to help us to get
there.

00:42:08.599 --> 00:42:14.210
&gt;&gt;MALE #1: Hand editing things like Wikipedia
is one way to get things, but to have things

00:42:14.210 --> 00:42:21.109
found more easily, particularly since you've
got so many institutions, some sort of metadata

00:42:21.109 --> 00:42:22.441
would be very helpful for finding it.

00:42:22.441 --> 00:42:27.020
Are you developing some sort of standards
for the metadata so people can find and put

00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:32.160
together parts of a program that makes sense
for them across multiple institutions?

00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:34.380
&gt;&gt;Cecilia Dâ€™Oliveira: Well, it's a really
good question.

00:42:34.380 --> 00:42:36.190
We've done very rudimentary things.

00:42:36.190 --> 00:42:40.290
I mean, certainly with OpenCourseWare at MIT
we have lots of metadata on our courses, down

00:42:40.290 --> 00:42:42.290
to the resource level.

00:42:42.290 --> 00:42:46.420
We've worked at the consortium level on some
search tools.

00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:50.830
So, if you go to the OCW Consortium site,
there's actually a search place where you

00:42:50.830 --> 00:42:54.940
can search for courses across all of the institutions.

00:42:54.940 --> 00:42:57.310
And those work marginally well.

00:42:57.310 --> 00:43:00.880
I mean, what we're dealing with is a bunch
of academic institutions that don't have a

00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:02.359
lot of resources.

00:43:02.359 --> 00:43:06.730
And we would love to have people who are experts
help us with this problem.

00:43:06.730 --> 00:43:08.300
We do the best we can do.

00:43:08.300 --> 00:43:10.540
So, but it's a big issue.

00:43:10.540 --> 00:43:15.410
Even just on the OpenCourseWare site at MIT
alone, I'd love to have help on our search.

00:43:15.410 --> 00:43:18.250
&gt;&gt;MALE #2: Quick question.

00:43:18.250 --> 00:43:22.440
Could you give me the website for your Japanese
material?

00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:24.060
&gt;&gt;Shigeru Miyagawa: Ah.

00:43:24.060 --> 00:43:25.890
It's, well, you can go to OCW.

00:43:25.890 --> 00:43:30.730
It's O-C-W dot M-I-T dot E-D-U.

00:43:30.730 --> 00:43:32.329
That's the general site.

00:43:32.329 --> 00:43:35.500
And on the left side, you will see different
schools.

00:43:35.500 --> 00:43:41.710
And my materials are under School of Humanities,
Arts, and Social Science.

00:43:41.710 --> 00:43:48.720
And if you go to foreign languages section,
you will find Japanese and Chinese and Spanish

00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:49.720
and so forth.

00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:50.720
&gt;&gt;MALE #2: OK.

00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:55.250
Now, the key one was O-C-W dot M-I-T dot slash--.

00:43:55.250 --> 00:43:56.270
&gt;&gt;Cecilia Dâ€™Oliveira: Dot E-D-U.

00:43:56.270 --> 00:43:57.270
&gt;&gt;Shigeru Miyagawa: Dot E-D-U.

00:43:57.270 --> 00:44:00.450
&gt;&gt;Graham Wharton: Chances are Google will
find it.

00:44:00.450 --> 00:44:01.450
[laughter]

00:44:01.450 --> 00:44:05.730
&gt;&gt;Cecilia Dâ€™Oliveira: Type in OpenCourseWare
Japanese, and it'll probably lead you there.

00:44:05.730 --> 00:44:09.369
&gt;&gt;Shigeru: There we go; there we go.

00:44:09.369 --> 00:44:17.819
&gt;&gt;MALE #3: So, when we're talking about a
formal course of study, you earn a degree

00:44:17.819 --> 00:44:23.560
or you earn in this case, let's say MIT has
a certain certificate of accomplishment.

00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:28.370
And that has a very clean delineation, demarcation
of learning.

00:44:28.370 --> 00:44:35.170
In the case of, as you said, the plurality
of users are self-learners, what metric are

00:44:35.170 --> 00:44:37.400
you using to define learning?

00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:42.690
Maybe you could elaborate on that and how
you might be able to use that as a way of,

00:44:42.690 --> 00:44:51.609
shall we say, tuning the output from OCW ON,
and the more general OER space.

00:44:51.609 --> 00:44:53.400
&gt;&gt;Cecilia Dâ€™Oliveira: That's a great question.

00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:56.940
And really, I mean, we have--.

00:44:56.940 --> 00:44:59.099
Our evaluation program includes three different
pieces.

00:44:59.099 --> 00:45:04.059
I mean, there's our web analytics, which is
what gives you the gross numbers of where

00:45:04.059 --> 00:45:08.550
people are coming from and how many visits
a month and all that.

00:45:08.550 --> 00:45:14.580
We also do, on a regular basis, surveys of
different target populations.

00:45:14.580 --> 00:45:18.349
We always do some kind of major user survey
every year.

00:45:18.349 --> 00:45:23.290
And through those surveys, we find out who
people are and how they're using the material.

00:45:23.290 --> 00:45:29.460
And we typically go into that with a very
constructed kind of evaluation tool to get

00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:33.230
at how are they using it, what were the outcomes,
and that sort of thing.

00:45:33.230 --> 00:45:36.670
It ends up that we publish that data.

00:45:36.670 --> 00:45:42.560
It's not like we have a before and after case
that we can build that says "this person started

00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:45.080
here, they did OCW, and this is where they
ended up."

00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:47.859
That's just a limitation of being in the kind
of world that we're in.

00:45:47.859 --> 00:45:52.470
I think MITx is gonna be able to do a heck
of a lot more because you'll be able to evaluate

00:45:52.470 --> 00:45:56.320
students on the way in and you'll be able
to evaluate students on the way out.

00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:59.630
Give you a lot more real learning data.

00:45:59.630 --> 00:46:03.880
But we try to do what we do with surveys and
then we actually go out we interview.

00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:08.450
We do interviews, in-depth interviews, with
a select number of people.

00:46:08.450 --> 00:46:10.190
And those end up being more like case studies.

00:46:10.190 --> 00:46:11.190
&gt;&gt;MALE #3: OK.

00:46:11.190 --> 00:46:15.650
So, just generally though, based off of the
surveys and the feedback that you received,

00:46:15.650 --> 00:46:22.349
of let's say the 43 percent of people who
are self-learners, what proportion of them

00:46:22.349 --> 00:46:29.150
are, shall we say, developing comprehension
as opposed to just looking up information?

00:46:29.150 --> 00:46:31.790
&gt;&gt;Cecilia Dâ€™Oliveira: A lot of it is reference
uses.

00:46:31.790 --> 00:46:38.230
I mean, people who are working professionals,
the typical thing there is they're trying

00:46:38.230 --> 00:46:40.339
to enhance their skill in a particular area.

00:46:40.339 --> 00:46:41.339
They come to the site.

00:46:41.339 --> 00:46:43.870
They look for a specific kind of course.

00:46:43.870 --> 00:46:46.030
They pick through it and they figure out,
"OK.

00:46:46.030 --> 00:46:48.150
Here's the couple things I wanna learn."

00:46:48.150 --> 00:46:51.900
They don't necessarily come and go through
an entire course.

00:46:51.900 --> 00:46:54.880
I mean, self-learners are all over the place,
too.

00:46:54.880 --> 00:46:59.580
We also have self-learners who I would say,
a typical high school student, who may not

00:46:59.580 --> 00:47:04.270
have access to AP Physics in the high school
they're in, but they wanna take it.

00:47:04.270 --> 00:47:09.410
And their teacher says, "Hey, Walter Lewin
teaches a wonderful course on OpenCourseWare.

00:47:09.410 --> 00:47:11.220
Just go watch his videos."

00:47:11.220 --> 00:47:14.030
And we've had people who've said they did
that.

00:47:14.030 --> 00:47:16.310
They aced their physics course.

00:47:16.310 --> 00:47:21.070
They aced their SAT subject tests and they
came to MIT.

00:47:21.070 --> 00:47:23.010
So, it's a whole range of things.

00:47:23.010 --> 00:47:24.599
I don't think--.

00:47:24.599 --> 00:47:26.930
That's about all I can say.

00:47:26.930 --> 00:47:28.720
&gt;&gt;MALE #3: Well, thank you.

00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:29.790
&gt;&gt;Cecilia Dâ€™Oliveira: Yeah.

00:47:29.790 --> 00:47:30.860
&gt;&gt;MALE #4: Hi.

00:47:30.860 --> 00:47:34.780
So, clearly OCW has had a lot of really great
impact on a lot of students out there who

00:47:34.780 --> 00:47:38.130
are trying to learn things or people who are
just trying to better teach things.

00:47:38.130 --> 00:47:42.740
Could you maybe talk a little bit about what
impact OCW has had on MIT?

00:47:42.740 --> 00:47:49.180
And whether OCW is doing or could be doing
anything to give back to the professors who

00:47:49.180 --> 00:47:51.170
are contributing content and the MIT community?

00:47:51.170 --> 00:47:52.200
&gt;&gt;Shigeru Miyagawa: Yes.

00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:53.200
Thank you.

00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:57.980
So, when we first proposed OCW, we had in
mind the rest of the world.

00:47:57.980 --> 00:48:05.069
And we did not really think about how it might
impact the institutes in education.

00:48:05.069 --> 00:48:11.560
But as we got into this, within just a few
years we realized that there's a whole set

00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:12.670
of benefits that we get.

00:48:12.670 --> 00:48:21.059
So, for example, right now, about 90 percent
of our students, MIT students, use OCW.

00:48:21.059 --> 00:48:22.059
How are they using it?

00:48:22.059 --> 00:48:27.120
Well, they're using it not only for their
own course, but they're looking at OCW sites

00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:32.930
of courses that they might want to take a
look at to take.

00:48:32.930 --> 00:48:37.150
Professors are using the OCW site to advise
students on courses that they might want to

00:48:37.150 --> 00:48:38.859
take.

00:48:38.859 --> 00:48:42.660
Eighty-four percent of faculty members are
using OCW.

00:48:42.660 --> 00:48:44.450
And how are they using that?

00:48:44.450 --> 00:48:49.750
Of course, they look at their own site, but
what's really remarkable to me is that those

00:48:49.750 --> 00:48:54.730
professors tell us that they are looking at
other professor's OCW sites and they want

00:48:54.730 --> 00:48:56.530
to see how they're teaching.

00:48:56.530 --> 00:49:00.920
But there's something actually quite, quite
important and profound about this.

00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:08.020
And this is a point that I make when we talk
about benefit to MIT.

00:49:08.020 --> 00:49:14.549
As faculty members, typically, and this is
true all over the world, once you start teaching,

00:49:14.549 --> 00:49:17.359
you rarely get to see other people teaching.

00:49:17.359 --> 00:49:19.680
So, you have your own model.

00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:22.369
But you don't see many, many models.

00:49:22.369 --> 00:49:27.099
But with OCW, all of a sudden, you get to
see a hundred different models.

00:49:27.099 --> 00:49:30.620
So, this is really helping the quality of
education.

00:49:30.620 --> 00:49:39.190
A third benefit is that we ask our freshman
if they are looking at OCW when they were

00:49:39.190 --> 00:49:44.839
in high school and roughly half said that
they were, which we are very happy about.

00:49:44.839 --> 00:49:50.920
But what was surprising to us was that of
those who were looking at OCW in high school,

00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:59.090
something like 36 percent told us that OCW
was a significant factor in school choice.

00:49:59.090 --> 00:50:04.890
And as you know, students who get into MIT
also get into other schools and of course,

00:50:04.890 --> 00:50:09.900
the primary reason is that they want to study
computer science and biology and so forth.

00:50:09.900 --> 00:50:13.870
But OCW played a significant role in school
choice.

00:50:13.870 --> 00:50:15.330
&gt;&gt;MALE #4: Thank you.

00:50:15.330 --> 00:50:19.190
&gt;&gt;Cecilia Dâ€™Oliveira: Can I just add quickly
that alumni make a large use of our site,

00:50:19.190 --> 00:50:20.190
too?

00:50:20.190 --> 00:50:21.190
So,--.

00:50:21.190 --> 00:50:23.599
&gt;&gt;Shigeru Miyagawa: Fifty percent of alumni
look at OCW site.

00:50:23.599 --> 00:50:28.280
&gt;&gt;MALE #5: Hi, I'm a proud OCW participant.

00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:30.890
I'm taking a course right now in computer
science with you guys.

00:50:30.890 --> 00:50:32.299
So, thank you.

00:50:32.299 --> 00:50:36.359
I actually wanted to start with a quick quote
from Kevin Kelly.

00:50:36.359 --> 00:50:38.710
He was a co-founder of Wired Magazine.

00:50:38.710 --> 00:50:43.069
And in his book, "What Technology Wants,"
he was actually writing about e-readers.

00:50:43.069 --> 00:50:47.880
But he wrote, "When we think about new technologies,
our immediate tendency is to imagine the new

00:50:47.880 --> 00:50:50.060
thing doing an old job better.

00:50:50.060 --> 00:50:52.839
That's why the first cars were called horseless
carriages.

00:50:52.839 --> 00:50:57.290
The first movies were simply straight-forward
documentary films of theatrical plays.

00:50:57.290 --> 00:51:01.950
And it took a long time to realize the full
dimensions of cinema photography as its own

00:51:01.950 --> 00:51:08.410
new medium that could achieve new things,
reveal new perspectives, do new jobs."

00:51:08.410 --> 00:51:13.390
And I think that the, it seems like the first
phase of OpenCourseWare, where we're simply

00:51:13.390 --> 00:51:16.890
putting the lectures online and allow people
to come and enjoy them, much as they would

00:51:16.890 --> 00:51:19.730
in a traditional environment, is almost like
that horseless carriage phase.

00:51:19.730 --> 00:51:23.869
It's very exciting to see things move into
this new phase where MITx is going to be offering

00:51:23.869 --> 00:51:26.130
its new courses online.

00:51:26.130 --> 00:51:30.250
I work at a company called Knewton and we
do adaptive learning technologies.

00:51:30.250 --> 00:51:33.089
So, these are basically a way to take any
kind of content, whether you're a textbook

00:51:33.089 --> 00:51:38.880
publisher, professor, etcetera, and drive
that content adaptively sot that no one student's

00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:41.010
path through a course is the same as any others.

00:51:41.010 --> 00:51:44.670
And the exciting thing about this actually
is that eventually it will allow us and other

00:51:44.670 --> 00:51:48.910
companies that are doing similar things to
what we're doing to have access to these huge

00:51:48.910 --> 00:51:53.630
reams of data on how students progress through
the course, how they learn best.

00:51:53.630 --> 00:51:59.329
And so, I was just curious, especially looking
forward to MITx, whether you're planning to

00:51:59.329 --> 00:52:04.220
use adaptive learning technologies and also
what implications you see for once you're

00:52:04.220 --> 00:52:10.410
collecting this data on students and when
you have millions of people around the world

00:52:10.410 --> 00:52:14.119
taking MITx courses, if that's going to be
something that you're gonna be looking at

00:52:14.119 --> 00:52:18.740
as a way to improve them, a way to uncover
new ways of teaching, etcetera?

00:52:18.740 --> 00:52:24.690
&gt;&gt;Cecilia Dâ€™Oliveira: I will say that there
are several faculty members who are involved

00:52:24.690 --> 00:52:31.560
in the MITx initiative that just get deliriously
happy for the reason that you just pointed

00:52:31.560 --> 00:52:37.010
out, which is access to data about what really
helps people learn.

00:52:37.010 --> 00:52:43.250
We have a professor in physics, Dave Pritchard,
who's been teaching a freshman physics course

00:52:43.250 --> 00:52:44.730
for several years.

00:52:44.730 --> 00:52:50.270
And he actually is into this whole adaptive
assessment kind of piece.

00:52:50.270 --> 00:52:51.430
He has his own software.

00:52:51.430 --> 00:52:55.140
He developed something called Mastering Physics,
which Pearson actually picked up and it's

00:52:55.140 --> 00:53:01.020
used by hundreds of thousands of people, which
does a lot of data collection and some amount

00:53:01.020 --> 00:53:02.440
of adaptive stuff.

00:53:02.440 --> 00:53:07.500
Dave is now working on another generation
of that and he's very--.

00:53:07.500 --> 00:53:11.320
I mention the Carnegie Mellon project, the
OLI Project, that does a lot of this adaptive

00:53:11.320 --> 00:53:13.940
stuff and Dave works very closely with them.

00:53:13.940 --> 00:53:19.720
So, I think that's a kind of thing that you'll
see over the next few years, get integrated

00:53:19.720 --> 00:53:20.720
in here.

00:53:20.720 --> 00:53:25.640
And yes, I agree with you about the--what
did we do?--this is first generation.

00:53:25.640 --> 00:53:29.200
OCW shows how MIT has taught.

00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:35.030
As teaching at MIT evolves through online
technologies, it will look different.

00:53:35.030 --> 00:53:37.830
&gt;&gt;Shigeru Miyagawa: Can I just add to that?

00:53:37.830 --> 00:53:42.230
OCW is a way of doing something new with something
old.

00:53:42.230 --> 00:53:45.599
But there's something very profound about
OCW.

00:53:45.599 --> 00:53:51.760
And that is that OCW's mission is really MIT's
mission.

00:53:51.760 --> 00:53:57.700
And OCW has allowed us to express that mission
of the institute in a new way.

00:53:57.700 --> 00:54:04.020
If you go to the website, it says that MIT's
mission is to create, to preserve, and disseminate

00:54:04.020 --> 00:54:08.920
knowledge and to bring that knowledge to bear
on the great problems of the world.

00:54:08.920 --> 00:54:12.880
So, MIT has been known for basic research
in expressing that.

00:54:12.880 --> 00:54:16.339
But now with OCW, we get to do that with education.

00:54:16.339 --> 00:54:18.630
And I think that's something that's really
important.

00:54:18.630 --> 00:54:23.970
And that's why it's been so successful at
MIT because it is a core value that we have

00:54:23.970 --> 00:54:25.770
been able to express with OCW.

00:54:25.770 --> 00:54:28.030
&gt;&gt;MALE #5: Thank you.

00:54:28.030 --> 00:54:32.540
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #1: Hi, my name is Diane Liebowitz.

00:54:32.540 --> 00:54:35.880
I graduated from MIT as an undergraduate.

00:54:35.880 --> 00:54:41.589
And just looking at MITx, something immediately
came to mind.

00:54:41.589 --> 00:54:47.520
One of the biggest problems that we deal with
now is unemployment.

00:54:47.520 --> 00:54:52.869
And a lot of that is in finance and a lot
of is because certain roles simply don't exist

00:54:52.869 --> 00:54:53.869
anymore.

00:54:53.869 --> 00:54:56.000
Mortgage-backed securities immediately come
to mind.

00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:01.799
And so, there are a lot of very bright people
out there in finance, many of them MIT graduates,

00:55:01.799 --> 00:55:05.940
who are in this situation and one of the ways
you deal with a situation like this if your

00:55:05.940 --> 00:55:11.910
role isn't so prominent anymore because of
the changing environment is to adapt your

00:55:11.910 --> 00:55:13.589
skill set.

00:55:13.589 --> 00:55:20.160
And what I'm seeing is that a lot of what
you do in order to adapt the skill set is

00:55:20.160 --> 00:55:26.140
learning new things, all of which have some
certification attached to them: C++ certification,

00:55:26.140 --> 00:55:29.710
SAS certification, Project Management certification.

00:55:29.710 --> 00:55:34.830
And let's say, to get one of these certifications,
all you need to do is just sign up for NYU

00:55:34.830 --> 00:55:41.080
Continuing Education, pay five or six thousand
dollars, and take a series of courses and

00:55:41.080 --> 00:55:42.460
you're certified.

00:55:42.460 --> 00:55:47.380
So, the first thing I thought of when I saw
MITx was, "Has any consideration been given

00:55:47.380 --> 00:55:53.140
to, let's say, somebody wants to get C++ certification
while they're not working.

00:55:53.140 --> 00:55:58.500
And really spend some productive time building
on their skill set without having to spend

00:55:58.500 --> 00:56:05.579
five or ten thousand dollars to do that, rather
than getting this official, very costly certification

00:56:05.579 --> 00:56:08.750
to get, let's say, an MITx certification?"

00:56:08.750 --> 00:56:10.950
It essentially means the same thing.

00:56:10.950 --> 00:56:15.609
The certification means you know the material,
which is what people really wanna hear.

00:56:15.609 --> 00:56:20.690
So, has there been any thought to maybe looking
into the types of things that people in the

00:56:20.690 --> 00:56:25.720
real world are out there trying to learn who
would need this certification to really adapt

00:56:25.720 --> 00:56:27.280
their skill set?

00:56:27.280 --> 00:56:33.270
Because the world is crawling with quants
right now and it's very tough to compete.

00:56:33.270 --> 00:56:37.480
And one way to compete is to learn some of
these skills if you're coming from finance,

00:56:37.480 --> 00:56:40.940
some of the more technical skills that you
might not have needed before.

00:56:40.940 --> 00:56:43.220
Because what you were doing before, let's
say, was very proprietary.

00:56:43.220 --> 00:56:47.730
But now you need C or SAS or MatLab or whatever.

00:56:47.730 --> 00:56:50.140
Has any thought been given to addressing that
population?

00:56:50.140 --> 00:56:51.819
&gt;&gt;Cecilia Dâ€™Oliveira: Shigeru, do you have
any insight to that?

00:56:51.819 --> 00:56:57.530
&gt;&gt;Shigeru Miyagawa: You're hitting at exactly
why we have to do this open learning.

00:56:57.530 --> 00:57:01.970
Open learning is exactly what you see, what
Stanford did with the AI course and what we

00:57:01.970 --> 00:57:03.700
intend to do with MITx.

00:57:03.700 --> 00:57:10.830
And that is that, I mean, exactly what you
said, that skill sets are changing and they

00:57:10.830 --> 00:57:12.890
change, according to some people, every five
years.

00:57:12.890 --> 00:57:13.890
You have to reboot.

00:57:13.890 --> 00:57:18.470
Now, every five years you cannot go back to
school because you are out there in society.

00:57:18.470 --> 00:57:25.329
And so, there has to be a way to reboot and
to learn new things.

00:57:25.329 --> 00:57:29.289
And open learning is, I believe, the way to
do it.

00:57:29.289 --> 00:57:36.480
And this is why it's going to be critical
that we provide the kinds of education that

00:57:36.480 --> 00:57:37.480
we see.

00:57:37.480 --> 00:57:40.770
Now, MIT offers a certain kind of education,
right?

00:57:40.770 --> 00:57:44.609
MIT's known for its science and engineering--the
STEM courses.

00:57:44.609 --> 00:57:50.829
And those are the courses that I would imagine
that MITx is going to focus on.

00:57:50.829 --> 00:57:53.410
We offer what we do best.

00:57:53.410 --> 00:57:57.099
Other schools will offer other skill sets,
but absolutely.

00:57:57.099 --> 00:58:04.730
This is going to be essential, critical to
our future in terms of the labor force and

00:58:04.730 --> 00:58:06.420
the wealth of the country.

00:58:06.420 --> 00:58:07.589
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #1: OK.

00:58:07.589 --> 00:58:08.589
Great.

00:58:08.589 --> 00:58:09.589
Thank you.

00:58:09.589 --> 00:58:13.760
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #6: Hi. Andrew Bein,
Class of '87.

00:58:13.760 --> 00:58:17.430
This has been great and the benefits are very
clear.

00:58:17.430 --> 00:58:24.049
I'd be very curious to hear if there had been
discovered costs, especially with a third

00:58:24.049 --> 00:58:29.380
new way of educating coming and what costs
have occurred and been anticipated, not in

00:58:29.380 --> 00:58:30.740
dollar, but in terms of education.

00:58:30.740 --> 00:58:34.130
I'll give you an example.

00:58:34.130 --> 00:58:39.070
If you're in classroom where there's a video
on, it's a different classroom experience

00:58:39.070 --> 00:58:42.920
than if you're just there with your fellow
students and a professor.

00:58:42.920 --> 00:58:44.390
Maybe a better experience, I'm not sure.

00:58:44.390 --> 00:58:49.150
But are there scenarios that you've looked
at and policies you've developed to deal with

00:58:49.150 --> 00:58:52.609
conflicts among the three different ways of
providing courses?

00:58:52.609 --> 00:58:59.150
&gt;&gt;Cecilia Dâ€™Oliveira: Well, within OCW I
can speak that we don't bring cameras into

00:58:59.150 --> 00:59:02.720
a classroom if it's gonna disrupt the learning
experience there.

00:59:02.720 --> 00:59:03.720
We tend to--.

00:59:03.720 --> 00:59:06.950
There are a lot of classrooms at MIT now that
have cameras that are built-in, just like

00:59:06.950 --> 00:59:11.039
this room has cameras that are built-in and
you just don't notice it.

00:59:11.039 --> 00:59:15.109
So, that's why for seminars, it's really hard
'cause we're not gonna bring a camera into

00:59:15.109 --> 00:59:18.890
a seminar 'cause it's gonna create an artificial
situation.

00:59:18.890 --> 00:59:23.490
So, just to answer that specific question.

00:59:23.490 --> 00:59:25.119
Are there other costs?

00:59:25.119 --> 00:59:26.630
We try to minimize faculty time.

00:59:26.630 --> 00:59:30.760
I mean, we try to keep faculty time to four
or five hours for an OCW course.

00:59:30.760 --> 00:59:31.950
We do all the work.

00:59:31.950 --> 00:59:35.210
That's why we cost four million dollars a
year.

00:59:35.210 --> 00:59:40.400
So, we've tried to avoid the impact on the
existing MIT educational program.

00:59:40.400 --> 00:59:46.660
&gt;&gt;MALE #7: To what extent could MITx or OCW
actually be used as a platform for innovation,

00:59:46.660 --> 00:59:51.089
with the possibility of self-learners contributing
back and perhaps solving some of the problems

00:59:51.089 --> 00:59:53.460
that even MIT hasn't solved yet?

00:59:53.460 --> 00:59:56.930
&gt;&gt;Cecilia Dâ€™Oliveira: I think that's yet
to be seen.

00:59:56.930 --> 00:59:57.930
MITx--.

00:59:57.930 --> 01:00:03.760
We'll have to see how that evolves and how
broad and sweeping the goals are.

01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:10.730
I do believe that you're gonna see much more
of a focus on community contribution and community

01:00:10.730 --> 01:00:14.539
participation than we've been able to deliver
in OpenCourseWare.

01:00:14.539 --> 01:00:18.500
I mean, there's a lot of resources that are
gonna be put into the development side of

01:00:18.500 --> 01:00:25.340
MITx to create the kind of platforms that
would allow that kind of interactivity.

01:00:25.340 --> 01:00:27.960
&gt;&gt;Shigeru Miyagawa: Yeah.

01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:30.549
We're seeing a little bit of it in OpenCourseWare
already.

01:00:30.549 --> 01:00:36.450
So, I was talking to professor in Chemical
Engineering who had launched a new course.

01:00:36.450 --> 01:00:39.609
And he needed some pieces of programming.

01:00:39.609 --> 01:00:45.369
And he went on OpenCourseWare and found what
he needed under the professor's site.

01:00:45.369 --> 01:00:49.319
And so, he got that and got the approval and
used it.

01:00:49.319 --> 01:00:51.840
So, there are things like this happening.

01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:54.359
We don't get to document it.

01:00:54.359 --> 01:00:59.849
But OCW does have that kind of dynamic built
into it as well.

01:00:59.849 --> 01:01:02.510
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #2: Hi.

01:01:02.510 --> 01:01:09.450
I was wondering what sorts of things are decided
within the coalition--the OCW coalition--

01:01:09.450 --> 01:01:16.539
and how you get decision-making to take place
and if there's anybody who has any kind of

01:01:16.539 --> 01:01:18.490
authority over or if it's just group decisions?

01:01:18.490 --> 01:01:20.540
I'm just curious about that part.

01:01:20.540 --> 01:01:24.099
&gt;&gt;Cecilia Dâ€™Oliveira: It's a very loose
consortium.

01:01:24.099 --> 01:01:27.440
I mean, there's a board of directors, but
the board of directors is really responsible

01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:28.440
to the membership.

01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:30.400
It's a membership organization.

01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:33.000
There are projects that get spawned.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:36.950
There will be some interest group in metadata,
for example.

01:01:36.950 --> 01:01:39.650
And you'll bring together technical people
from around the consortium and they might

01:01:39.650 --> 01:01:41.849
come up with a standard.

01:01:41.849 --> 01:01:46.430
We had a group that got together several years
ago to look at best practices in what's called

01:01:46.430 --> 01:01:54.050
Fair Use under copyright law and to actually
write a document together that tried to articulate

01:01:54.050 --> 01:01:55.050
policy--.

01:01:55.050 --> 01:02:01.119
Not policy-level, but what our practices would
be in terms of using Fair Use in our content.

01:02:01.119 --> 01:02:06.700
But there's no, it's not like a group that
has any power over any of the institutions.

01:02:06.700 --> 01:02:11.890
It's really a membership organization designed
to help the members on whatever the problems

01:02:11.890 --> 01:02:13.890
are that they have in common.

01:02:13.890 --> 01:02:20.140
&gt;&gt;MALE #8: So, I apologize for what might
be a naive question, but when I think of things

01:02:20.140 --> 01:02:25.670
like OpenCourseWare and the OER initiatives,
I naturally think of the impact it would have

01:02:25.670 --> 01:02:27.039
on the cost of tuition.

01:02:27.039 --> 01:02:32.400
So, there's been a lot of talk lately about
increasing cost of tuition, bubbles in tuition,

01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:33.400
things like that.

01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:38.130
I'm curious if you can talk about how you
think the various initiatives, OER, OCW, as

01:02:38.130 --> 01:02:41.549
well as MITx, could potentially impact that
in the long term.

01:02:41.549 --> 01:02:46.940
Is it, yes it could impact it in a very dangerous
way, like really affecting tuitions?

01:02:46.940 --> 01:02:48.920
Maybe it'll bring it down a little bit, but
not significantly?

01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:51.230
Or, they are two completely different things.

01:02:51.230 --> 01:02:56.829
MITx is really addressing people, trying to
do continuing education, and things like that.

01:02:56.829 --> 01:03:00.400
And existing tuition policies are a completely
different bucket and there's no reason to

01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:01.869
worry about the two interacting.

01:03:01.869 --> 01:03:03.200
&gt;&gt;Cecilia Dâ€™Oliveira: Ooh.

01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:04.829
That's a hard question.

01:03:04.829 --> 01:03:10.849
I can tell you that in the discussions that
I've heard at MIT about why are we doing MITx,

01:03:10.849 --> 01:03:15.400
I've never heard someone say, "We're doing
it because we've gotta deliver education more

01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:16.400
cheaply."

01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:20.359
[chuckles] That hasn't been part of the whole
equation.

01:03:20.359 --> 01:03:24.450
It's been, "Can we scale it to like, a lot
of people?"

01:03:24.450 --> 01:03:28.150
It's been, "Can we figure out how to teach
online effectively so that we can improve

01:03:28.150 --> 01:03:34.510
our own educational programs and give our
students more flexibility?"

01:03:34.510 --> 01:03:39.390
As an engineer at MIT, as a student at MIT,
it's really hard to go away for a semester

01:03:39.390 --> 01:03:43.910
and study someplace else because we don't
have online capabilities.

01:03:43.910 --> 01:03:47.250
That means when you go, you can't take MIT
courses.

01:03:47.250 --> 01:03:52.089
[chuckles] And that's hard and it really messes
up your whole degree path.

01:03:52.089 --> 01:03:53.400
So, that's one.

01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:57.650
I think that's some of the thinking in terms
of MITx is we've gotta figure out how to do

01:03:57.650 --> 01:04:03.619
online education at MIT for MIT students,
so that we can improve our educational program.

01:04:03.619 --> 01:04:06.819
But it's not to make it cheaper to do.

01:04:06.819 --> 01:04:11.859
Now, there may be things that come around
that it's gonna be less expensive.

01:04:11.859 --> 01:04:17.480
Now, OER on the other hand, look outside the
broader world, OER certainly is being used

01:04:17.480 --> 01:04:19.450
to try to reduce the cost of textbooks.

01:04:19.450 --> 01:04:22.950
I mean, textbooks is a huge issue.

01:04:22.950 --> 01:04:28.890
Cost of textbooks in community colleges, pretty
much every community college that I have sampled,

01:04:28.890 --> 01:04:34.150
the textbook cost is at least 50 percent of
the total cost of education.

01:04:34.150 --> 01:04:38.480
In California, it's more than the cost of
tuition.

01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:43.950
So, the textbooks, I think, there's a lot
of opportunity to drive costs way down.

01:04:43.950 --> 01:04:49.089
For our educational programs, I haven't heard
the discussions along those lines.

01:04:49.089 --> 01:04:53.630
&gt;&gt;Shigeru Miyagawa: See, one thing to keep
in mind is that MIT, like many Ivy schools,

01:04:53.630 --> 01:05:00.390
have a need blind policy, which means that
a student that's accepted at MIT and then

01:05:00.390 --> 01:05:05.670
once the decision is made, then we take a
look at the financial needs of the student

01:05:05.670 --> 01:05:09.700
and we give that student whatever he or she
needs to come to MIT.

01:05:09.700 --> 01:05:15.210
And so, yes, the tuition is expensive, but
we try to help out.

01:05:15.210 --> 01:05:21.770
Now, if something like MITx or some other
effort can bring us extra revenue to MIT,

01:05:21.770 --> 01:05:28.440
then that could be turned into more financial
aid for students who need it so that we can

01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:34.250
give opportunity as wide an array of students
as possible to come to MIT.

01:05:34.250 --> 01:05:36.250
&gt;&gt;MALE #8: Thank you.

01:05:36.250 --> 01:05:37.750
&gt;&gt;MALE #9: Hello.

01:05:37.750 --> 01:05:39.369
My name is Jay Damask.

01:05:39.369 --> 01:05:40.390
I'm Class of '90.

01:05:40.390 --> 01:05:41.869
And I'm glad you talked about textbooks.

01:05:41.869 --> 01:05:44.069
My question to you is about archiving.

01:05:44.069 --> 01:05:51.740
I go back and look at Gil Strang's book, 18.06,
or Sussman 6.001 all the time, and I've been

01:05:51.740 --> 01:05:53.560
out and out for a long time.

01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:58.680
How is it that OCW after so many learns or
perhaps MITx, in ten years, in twenty years,

01:05:58.680 --> 01:06:01.770
can go back and refresh the material that
they learned?

01:06:01.770 --> 01:06:03.510
That's my question.

01:06:03.510 --> 01:06:12.250
&gt;&gt;Shigeru Miyagawa: Well, of course, what
I said to an earlier question, MITx or something

01:06:12.250 --> 01:06:16.369
like it, is open education, which means it's
going to be--.

01:06:16.369 --> 01:06:19.230
The content is going to be available to anyone
who wants to--.

01:06:19.230 --> 01:06:23.200
&gt;&gt;MALE #9: Yeah, but this content will vary
and grow over this period of time.

01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:27.440
And when it's flat, like a PDF, you can print
it out and put it in your file.

01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:30.190
But when it's more interactive, that's hard
to capture.

01:06:30.190 --> 01:06:31.190
&gt;&gt;Shigeru Miyagawa: Yeah.

01:06:31.190 --> 01:06:32.190
Yeah.

01:06:32.190 --> 01:06:33.390
So, that is something about OCW.

01:06:33.390 --> 01:06:35.710
Much of OCW is PDF.

01:06:35.710 --> 01:06:39.410
I don't know exactly what is being planned
as far as that's concerned for MITx.

01:06:39.410 --> 01:06:48.460
It is our hope that it would be interactive
in a way that would be more up to date on

01:06:48.460 --> 01:06:49.520
a given basis.

01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:51.450
But that's still to be worked out.

01:06:51.450 --> 01:06:53.400
&gt;&gt;Cecilia Dâ€™Oliveira: It's an interesting
question.

01:06:53.400 --> 01:06:56.940
With OCW, we have worked out ways of archiving
stuff.

01:06:56.940 --> 01:06:59.720
So, we archive to what's called D-space at
MIT.

01:06:59.720 --> 01:07:01.580
It's a big repository.

01:07:01.580 --> 01:07:06.630
You can get to all the old OCW stuff from
2001 in there.

01:07:06.630 --> 01:07:09.020
How you do that on an interactive system?

01:07:09.020 --> 01:07:10.520
Good question.

01:07:10.520 --> 01:07:11.900
I don't think we know yet.

01:07:11.900 --> 01:07:12.900
[laughs]

01:07:12.900 --> 01:07:14.540
&gt;&gt;MALE #9: Thank you very much.

01:07:14.540 --> 01:07:15.950
&gt;&gt;Cecilia Dâ€™Oliveira: Thank you.

01:07:15.950 --> 01:07:17.000
&gt;&gt;MALE #10: Hi.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:18.000
Adam Bookbinder.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:19.819
I work here.

01:07:19.819 --> 01:07:27.799
Speaking of textbooks, back in I think 2003,
2004, I was a grad student and I first heard

01:07:27.799 --> 01:07:31.599
of OpenCourseWare and I was very excited to
hear about this.

01:07:31.599 --> 01:07:36.839
And I remember finding that only a few of
the courses had textbooks and that's still

01:07:36.839 --> 01:07:40.520
the case that it's only a few of them.

01:07:40.520 --> 01:07:45.359
As you said, the cost of textbooks is incredibly
high, especially for people in community colleges

01:07:45.359 --> 01:07:46.500
and so forth.

01:07:46.500 --> 01:07:52.720
And given that the people at MIT are some
of the elites in their fields, you could set

01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:55.339
standards for textbooks and so forth.

01:07:55.339 --> 01:08:02.750
And I guess I'm wondering how hard is it to
get a standard textbook released openly and

01:08:02.750 --> 01:08:04.069
get it used widely?

01:08:04.069 --> 01:08:11.421
That could help out a lot of even traditional
students with school if they didn't have to

01:08:11.421 --> 01:08:17.500
each go through the whole textbook rigmarole
if there were a free and open textbook, especially

01:08:17.500 --> 01:08:18.510
for basic subjects.

01:08:18.510 --> 01:08:21.320
I mean, linear algebra hasn't really changed
in 50 years, you know?

01:08:21.320 --> 01:08:22.320
[laughter]

01:08:22.320 --> 01:08:23.320
&gt;&gt;Cecilia Dâ€™Oliveira: Yeah.

01:08:23.320 --> 01:08:25.420
I mean, the answer to that varies from publisher
to publisher.

01:08:25.420 --> 01:08:28.180
A lot of these textbooks are locked up with
publishers.

01:08:28.180 --> 01:08:32.900
And we had a case recently where a faculty
member went back to the publisher and said,

01:08:32.900 --> 01:08:35.620
"Hey, I think it's time for you to give me
back the rights to my book.

01:08:35.620 --> 01:08:37.120
I wanna put it on OpenCourseWare."

01:08:37.120 --> 01:08:38.290
And that happened.

01:08:38.290 --> 01:08:42.450
But if it's a book that's being actively used,
the publishers aren't gonna do that.

01:08:42.450 --> 01:08:45.460
On the other hand, we have something called
"OCW Scholar Courses."

01:08:45.460 --> 01:08:52.390
We're building 20 foundation level courses--first-year
courses in math, physics, biology, computer

01:08:52.390 --> 01:08:53.410
science.

01:08:53.410 --> 01:08:55.800
And what we're trying to do there is exactly
deal with this issue.

01:08:55.800 --> 01:09:00.390
We're trying to get enough notes and stuff
together that effectively we have what the

01:09:00.390 --> 01:09:02.140
textbook would have.

01:09:02.140 --> 01:09:04.380
So, we've got five of those on OCW now.

01:09:04.380 --> 01:09:07.560
We have another seven coming in the next three
weeks.

01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:10.590
And by the end of next year, we'll have a
total of 20.

01:09:10.590 --> 01:09:14.730
So, those will address for the foundation
level, I think, the content issues.

01:09:14.730 --> 01:09:16.630
Are you signaling to me, Graham?

01:09:16.630 --> 01:09:19.280
&gt;&gt;Graham Wharton: I'm your clock.

01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:23.200
&gt;&gt;Cecilia Dâ€™Oliveira: We can probably take
a couple of more questions and then we, I

01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:26.870
think, have to call a halt.

01:09:26.870 --> 01:09:27.870
This is a one--.

01:09:27.870 --> 01:09:28.870
And thank you so much.

01:09:28.870 --> 01:09:29.870
This is great.

01:09:29.870 --> 01:09:30.870
You guys are fantastic.

01:09:30.870 --> 01:09:31.870
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #3: Hi.

01:09:31.870 --> 01:09:35.950
I was wondering if you could say anything
about what sort of content MITx is gonna offer

01:09:35.950 --> 01:09:41.380
and whether it's gonna be digitized versions
of current MIT classes or whether there's

01:09:41.380 --> 01:09:42.480
gonna be new content?

01:09:42.480 --> 01:09:44.780
And also, what sort of time commitment?

01:09:44.780 --> 01:09:49.870
Is it gonna be similar to the Stanford model
in that it's a scaled down version of a college

01:09:49.870 --> 01:09:50.870
class?

01:09:50.870 --> 01:09:54.320
So, to make it more accessible to working
people and people who are in school doing

01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:55.320
other things.

01:09:55.320 --> 01:09:56.320
That sort of thing.

01:09:56.320 --> 01:09:57.320
&gt;&gt;Cecilia Dâ€™Oliveira: It's easy to answer
that.

01:09:57.320 --> 01:09:58.320
Stay tuned.

01:09:58.320 --> 01:09:59.320
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #3: OK.

01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:00.320
[giggles]

01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:01.840
&gt;&gt;Cecilia Dâ€™Oliveira: We're not involved
in the design of those courses and I think

01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:04.000
those decisions are being made right now.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.070
So, we'll see.

01:10:06.070 --> 01:10:07.480
Stanford has been a good model.

01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:10.440
Whether MIT chooses to follow that or not,
it remains to be seen.

01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:11.440
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #3: All right.

01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:12.440
Thanks.

01:10:12.440 --> 01:10:13.440
&gt;&gt;Cecilia Dâ€™Oliveira: Thanks for your question.

01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:18.380
&gt;&gt;Shigeru Miyagawa: I should add that the
director of C-Suite, who is lead on MITx,

01:10:18.380 --> 01:10:23.540
has offered to talk about this at Google Cambridge.

01:10:23.540 --> 01:10:30.180
&gt;&gt;MALE A #11: What is the role of a textbook
publisher going forward?

01:10:30.180 --> 01:10:32.620
And what do you think of Apple's textbook
initiative?

01:10:32.620 --> 01:10:35.040
&gt;&gt;Cecilia Dâ€™Oliveira: Oh, I don't know if
I--.

01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:36.970
I don't know if we have time to get into that.

01:10:36.970 --> 01:10:42.310
And I'm not really necessarily an expert in
that.

01:10:42.310 --> 01:10:45.720
You know, I think there's a lot of different
opinions at this point in time.

01:10:45.720 --> 01:10:47.700
It's exciting from a technology perspective.

01:10:47.700 --> 01:10:48.700
It's a lot of whiz bang.

01:10:48.700 --> 01:10:53.290
I mean, these textbooks are unbelievable.

01:10:53.290 --> 01:10:54.970
But they're not open.

01:10:54.970 --> 01:10:57.060
And we're in the open world.

01:10:57.060 --> 01:10:58.170
&gt;&gt;MALE #11: Thank you.

01:10:58.170 --> 01:10:59.210
&gt;&gt;Shigeru Miyagawa: One more?

01:10:59.210 --> 01:11:00.800
&gt;&gt;MALE #12: Thank you for one last question.

01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:05.730
I'm a high school educator, so I noted with
interest that the high school market is something

01:11:05.730 --> 01:11:08.740
that you guys target as a potential future
partner.

01:11:08.740 --> 01:11:10.870
So, I really have two things I'm curious about.

01:11:10.870 --> 01:11:17.560
One is, do you see anybody currently now doing
for high school what OCW has done for college-level

01:11:17.560 --> 01:11:18.560
study?

01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:22.590
And two, what do you think high school partnership
is going to look like for OCW?

01:11:22.590 --> 01:11:23.920
Do you have ideas what that might look like?

01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:27.630
&gt;&gt;Shigeru Miyagawa: So, we have a cycle, high
school update for high school--.

01:11:27.630 --> 01:11:28.750
&gt;&gt;Cecilia Dâ€™Oliveira: Highlights for high
school.

01:11:28.750 --> 01:11:29.750
&gt;&gt;Shigeru Miyagawa: Yeah.

01:11:29.750 --> 01:11:36.490
Where we've created a portal for high school
teachers and students to come in.

01:11:36.490 --> 01:11:45.060
We did not change the content, but to point
out where in the present OCW content things

01:11:45.060 --> 01:11:48.580
are useful for high school, particularly AP
classes.

01:11:48.580 --> 01:11:49.840
So, we have that.

01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:50.840
Take a look.

01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:56.691
There are many of us who do take our content,
which we created for MIT, and we take it to

01:11:56.691 --> 01:11:57.691
high school.

01:11:57.691 --> 01:12:03.730
So for example, I have a course that I teach
with a colleague of mine, history, on Asian

01:12:03.730 --> 01:12:06.590
History, and we use a lot of visuals.

01:12:06.590 --> 01:12:08.160
And we've taken this to high schools.

01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:14.000
And we've actually trained close to two thousand
high school teachers in face-to-face workshops

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:18.610
using our OCW site for it to be used in high
school classes.

01:12:18.610 --> 01:12:20.410
&gt;&gt;MALE #12: Thank you.

01:12:20.410 --> 01:12:25.780
&gt;&gt;Graham Wharton: So, I want to thank both
of you very much for coming and sharing all

01:12:25.780 --> 01:12:26.860
of this with us.

01:12:26.860 --> 01:12:28.970
This is very exciting.

01:12:28.970 --> 01:12:33.180
I think Scott has a few words to say about
upcoming events.

01:12:33.180 --> 01:12:39.310
And I invite you all to stay around a little
bit after his words to chat with everyone

01:12:39.310 --> 01:12:41.990
and to enjoy the remainder of the food.

01:12:41.990 --> 01:12:42.990
&gt;&gt;Shigeru Miyagawa: Thank you.

01:12:42.990 --> 01:12:43.990
&gt;&gt;Cecilia Dâ€™Oliveira: Thanks.

01:12:43.990 --> 01:12:44.990
&gt;&gt;Scott Morrison: First, I want to thank--.

01:12:44.990 --> 01:12:48.490
&gt;&gt;Graham Wharton: And once again, please join
me in a round of applause.

01:12:48.490 --> 01:12:50.340
&gt;&gt;Cecilia Dâ€™Oliveira: Thank you.

01:12:50.340 --> 01:12:51.340
[applause]

01:12:51.340 --> 01:12:52.340
&gt;&gt;Scott Morrison: OK.

01:12:52.340 --> 01:12:56.560
Just very quickly before the networking and
the remainder of the food, I just want to

01:12:56.560 --> 01:13:01.160
let you know about a couple of upcoming MIT
Club of New York events.

01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:02.800
We have a social event next week.

01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:06.650
It's an interclub Winter Mingle on February
7th.

01:13:06.650 --> 01:13:12.850
February 27th, Energy Efficiency and Quantum
dot Nano Materials.

01:13:12.850 --> 01:13:19.600
March 1st, another event that was being put
together by Yu-Hui Lin, who is our Vice President

01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:24.000
of Educational and Cultural Programs who is
responsible, her and her team, responsible

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.100
from the club for tonight's event.

01:13:26.100 --> 01:13:31.450
It'll be MIT Comes to New York, an evening
with Professor Peter Diamond.

01:13:31.450 --> 01:13:35.850
He's an institute professor, Nobel Laureate
in Economics and the discussion will be on

01:13:35.850 --> 01:13:38.310
significant global economic issues of the
day.

01:13:38.310 --> 01:13:40.100
So, we hope that you'll join us for that.

01:13:40.100 --> 01:13:41.630
That will be held at Credit Swiss.

01:13:41.630 --> 01:13:44.110
And again, that's on March 1st.

01:13:44.110 --> 01:13:52.730
March 6th, MIT Public Service Center is the
PSC, another wonderful innovation-led group

01:13:52.730 --> 01:13:54.970
doing work all around the world.

01:13:54.970 --> 01:14:01.730
This will be MIT Club of New York Professional
Programs and the Hub New York City presenting

01:14:01.730 --> 01:14:05.420
New York City's second annual launch of the
MIT Idea's Global Challenge.

01:14:05.420 --> 01:14:07.870
So, again, that's March 6th.

01:14:07.870 --> 01:14:13.690
March 17th, our community services will be
asking for volunteers for the 2012 First Robotics

01:14:13.690 --> 01:14:17.050
Competition, New York Regional Championship
at the Javits Center.

01:14:17.050 --> 01:14:18.520
Again, March 17th.

01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:21.840
And then, March 27th, something that I think
will be of interest.

01:14:21.840 --> 01:14:24.450
Professional Programs presenting on Speaking
Up.

01:14:24.450 --> 01:14:30.280
This will be a panel discussion about how
managers in varied industries will discuss

01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:33.510
how they communicate effectively, and in some
cases, cross-culturally.

01:14:33.510 --> 01:14:40.910
And then, the last one to mention is May 15th,
the Energy C-Suite Series on electron beam

01:14:40.910 --> 01:14:41.910
technology.

01:14:41.910 --> 01:14:46.000
So, we do hope that you'll join us and please
join us now for networking and food.

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:47.000
Thanks very much.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:48.000
&gt;&gt;Cecilia Dâ€™Oliveira: Great.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:48.001
[applause]
