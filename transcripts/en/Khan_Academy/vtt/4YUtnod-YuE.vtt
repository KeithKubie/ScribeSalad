00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:02.800
In the last video, we
talked about the idea

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:07.310
that if I dug up a bone
someplace, if I dug up a bone,

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:09.300
and if I were to
measure its carbon-14,

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.140
and I found that it had half
of the carbon-14 that I would

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.440
expect to find in a living
animal or plant, that I said,

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.710
hey, maybe one half life
has gone by, or roughly

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.700
for carbon-14, one half
life is 5,730 years.

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.290
So I said maybe it's 5,730
years since this bone was

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:32.880
part of a living animal,
or it's roughly that old.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.800
Now, when I did that, I made
a pretty big assumption,

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.450
and some you all have touched on
this in the comments on YouTube

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.930
on the last video,
is how do I know

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.140
that this estimate I made
is based on the assumption

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.430
that the amount of
carbon-14 in the atmosphere

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.840
would have been roughly constant
from when this bone was living

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:53.940
to now?

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.270
And so the question is,
is the amount of carbon-14

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.490
in the atmosphere
and in the water,

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:02.450
and in living plants and
animals, is it constant?

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.700
And if it isn't constant, how do
you calibrate your measurement

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.910
so you can actually figure
out how much carbon-14 there

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:13.692
is relative to living plants
and animals at that time?

00:01:13.692 --> 00:01:15.650
And the way that you can
make that calibration,

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.310
because it turns out it
isn't perfectly constant,

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.950
the way that you can make that
calibration, there's two ways,

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:22.760
and I have pictures
here of both of them,

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.930
one is to look at tree things.

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:25.640
Tree rings.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.150
And I'm told this will work
up to about 10,000 years.

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.840
Up to 10,000 years old.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.685
I don't know of any
10,000 year old trees,

00:01:34.685 --> 00:01:36.520
I don't think anyone
does, but maybe there's

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.901
some remains of old trees.

00:01:38.901 --> 00:01:41.400
And you can look at their tree
rings, and I think most of us

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.140
are familiar with this idea that
every year that a tree grows,

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.440
it forms another layer of bark.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.880
And so you can look back
to that layer of bark

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.800
just for the half
life of carbon-14,

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.580
and then figure out how
much carbon-14 was there

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.760
in the atmosphere at
that period in time.

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.970
And so it's kind of a
record of the atmosphere up

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:03.310
to 10,000 years.

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:04.920
If you want to go
even further back,

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.200
you can look at cave
deposits, and the fancy word

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.780
for these cave deposits
are speleothems.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.020
Speleothems.

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.940
Speleothems.

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.840
You might be familiar
with stalagmites.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.180
Those are those speleothems
that are kind of coming out

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.054
of the bottom of the
cave, or stalactites.

00:02:22.054 --> 00:02:23.470
Those are the
speleothems that are

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.562
coming from the top of the cave.

00:02:25.562 --> 00:02:27.020
But the reason why
these are useful

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.650
is these are formed
by calcium carbonate,

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.580
so they have carbon in them,
and slowly over, really,

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.010
tens of thousands of years,
the water in the cave deposits

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.140
that calcium carbonate.

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.980
So it's a record of the fraction
of carbon-14 in some of those

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:42.480
years.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.830
And you can go down to
resolutions of as small as 10

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:46.740
years.

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.940
And so this will give
us pretty good estimates

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.220
over tens of thousands of
years, up to 50,000 years.

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.020
And frankly, carbon-14
isn't even useful

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:00.205
beyond, really, 50,000
or 60,000 years.

00:03:00.205 --> 00:03:04.350
So this gives us a good
record of carbon-14

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:05.930
in the atmosphere,
assuming that it's

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.830
fairly uniform throughout
the atmosphere,

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.380
and all evidence suggests
that, and that that uniformity

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.740
through the atmosphere also
goes into the water supply,

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.450
and into living
plants and animals.

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.160
Now, the other thing, and I
looked into this a little bit,

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.360
it actually turns out because we
are spewing so much fossil fuel

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.660
right now, we are
changing the amount,

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.510
or the proportion of carbon-14
much, much faster than has

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.880
happened in other time periods.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.770
So just to answer
the question, it's

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:39.310
actually probably in
really, the last 50 years

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.060
where the fossil
fuel use has really

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.050
exploded that we've
really been changing

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.080
the proportion of
carbon-14 relative

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.300
to the other isotopes of carbon.

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:51.190
But anyway, hopefully
that rests some

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.810
of your worries
about the assumption

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.270
that I made in the last
video about carbon-14

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:57.590
being relatively constant.

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.820
There are ways to look
back at specific years

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:03.910
and figure out the relative
amounts of carbon-14,

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.810
so it is a pretty
good way of estimating

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.560
how old living things
are, especially

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.460
things that are less
than 50,000 years old.
