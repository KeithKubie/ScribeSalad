00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.750
there are a lot of people out there

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:03.760
there are a lot of people out there
 

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:06.300
there are a lot of people out there
right now that are talking about things

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:06.310
right now that are talking about things
 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:09.600
right now that are talking about things
like neuromarketing neuro economics and

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:09.610
like neuromarketing neuro economics and
 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:11.580
like neuromarketing neuro economics and
they're based on this idea that now that

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:11.590
they're based on this idea that now that
 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:13.320
they're based on this idea that now that
we can sort of peek inside of a working

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:13.330
we can sort of peek inside of a working
 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:16.830
we can sort of peek inside of a working
brain that you know we can we can be

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:16.840
brain that you know we can we can be
 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.230
brain that you know we can we can be
much more precise in how we we do things

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:19.240
much more precise in how we we do things
 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.650
much more precise in how we we do things
but unfortunately a lot of that is the

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:22.660
but unfortunately a lot of that is the
 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:24.990
but unfortunately a lot of that is the
science isn't there yet I mean the using

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:25.000
science isn't there yet I mean the using
 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.430
science isn't there yet I mean the using
a functional magnetic resonance imaging

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:26.440
a functional magnetic resonance imaging
 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.460
a functional magnetic resonance imaging
device to you know figure out what's the

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:29.470
device to you know figure out what's the
 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:30.960
device to you know figure out what's the
best color to make your product you know

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:30.970
best color to make your product you know
 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.150
best color to make your product you know
I'll strap a guy in an fMRI and I'll run

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:33.160
I'll strap a guy in an fMRI and I'll run
 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.380
I'll strap a guy in an fMRI and I'll run
him through this thing and then hey I'll

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:34.390
him through this thing and then hey I'll
 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.660
him through this thing and then hey I'll
have the best you know branding you know

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:36.670
have the best you know branding you know
 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.990
have the best you know branding you know
stuff for you is silly and and the

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.000
stuff for you is silly and and the
 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.120
stuff for you is silly and and the
reason why is because you know the

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:42.130
reason why is because you know the
 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:44.100
reason why is because you know the
Machine your brain doesn't work that way

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:44.110
Machine your brain doesn't work that way
 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:45.990
Machine your brain doesn't work that way
the machine is looking at blood flow

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:46.000
the machine is looking at blood flow
 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.400
the machine is looking at blood flow
which takes you know seconds to occur

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410
which takes you know seconds to occur
 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.049
which takes you know seconds to occur
the brain is working in hundreds of

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:52.059
the brain is working in hundreds of
 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:53.520
the brain is working in hundreds of
seconds so I mean you're seeing stuff

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:53.530
seconds so I mean you're seeing stuff
 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.530
seconds so I mean you're seeing stuff
long after whatever the thought is and

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:55.540
long after whatever the thought is and
 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.240
long after whatever the thought is and
then we do a lot of reverse inference to

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:57.250
then we do a lot of reverse inference to
 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.520
then we do a lot of reverse inference to
try to figure it out but and we're kind

00:00:59.520 --> 00:00:59.530
try to figure it out but and we're kind
 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:00.750
try to figure it out but and we're kind
of like you know

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760
of like you know
 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.729
of like you know
Galileo having the first telescope I'm

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:02.739
Galileo having the first telescope I'm
 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:03.990
Galileo having the first telescope I'm
well yeah we're yeah we can see the

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.000
well yeah we're yeah we can see the
 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.580
well yeah we're yeah we can see the
rings of Saturn but we still can't see

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590
rings of Saturn but we still can't see
 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.649
rings of Saturn but we still can't see
distant galaxies and we're just

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:07.659
distant galaxies and we're just
 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:10.590
distant galaxies and we're just
beginning to sort of see this and so my

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600
beginning to sort of see this and so my
 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.679
beginning to sort of see this and so my
approach to this has been that there is

00:01:13.679 --> 00:01:13.689
approach to this has been that there is
 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:16.289
approach to this has been that there is
a lot we can do with the information we

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:16.299
a lot we can do with the information we
 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:19.230
a lot we can do with the information we
have now as opposed to the information

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240
have now as opposed to the information
 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.050
have now as opposed to the information
we might wish we had and this is a very

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060
we might wish we had and this is a very
 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.179
we might wish we had and this is a very
different kind of a framework so there

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:24.189
different kind of a framework so there
 

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:27.749
different kind of a framework so there
are some companies there's a there's a

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:27.759
are some companies there's a there's a
 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:29.879
are some companies there's a there's a
knows Altman's doing this with deep

00:01:29.879 --> 00:01:29.889
knows Altman's doing this with deep
 

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:32.519
knows Altman's doing this with deep
metaphors there's other companies that

00:01:32.519 --> 00:01:32.529
metaphors there's other companies that
 

00:01:32.529 --> 00:01:33.690
metaphors there's other companies that
are using you know some of the

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700
are using you know some of the
 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.609
are using you know some of the
technologies you know I mean we've done

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619
technologies you know I mean we've done
 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:36.959
technologies you know I mean we've done
everything from galvanic skin response

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:36.969
everything from galvanic skin response
 

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:42.179
everything from galvanic skin response
to you know you know EKGs or EEG s and

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:42.189
to you know you know EKGs or EEG s and
 

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:45.120
to you know you know EKGs or EEG s and
you know to me I think that what's neat

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130
you know to me I think that what's neat
 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.239
you know to me I think that what's neat
is that we can actually get this the

00:01:48.239 --> 00:01:48.249
is that we can actually get this the
 

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:51.330
is that we can actually get this the
exact opposite which is this simplifies

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340
exact opposite which is this simplifies
 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.519
exact opposite which is this simplifies
things I know that it really is about

00:01:53.519 --> 00:01:53.529
things I know that it really is about
 

00:01:53.529 --> 00:01:55.589
things I know that it really is about
how many times a customer does something

00:01:55.589 --> 00:01:55.599
how many times a customer does something
 

00:01:55.599 --> 00:01:58.440
how many times a customer does something
I know that the way habit forms is that

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450
I know that the way habit forms is that
 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.510
I know that the way habit forms is that
there are a strengthening of neural

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520
there are a strengthening of neural
 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:01.889
there are a strengthening of neural
neural connections in the brain and

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:01.899
neural connections in the brain and
 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:03.389
neural connections in the brain and
specific parts of the brain I know how

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:03.399
specific parts of the brain I know how
 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:05.370
specific parts of the brain I know how
that works I know I know that process

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380
that works I know I know that process
 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.949
that works I know I know that process
now and so a large part of that and my I

00:02:07.949 --> 00:02:07.959
now and so a large part of that and my I
 

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:10.980
now and so a large part of that and my I
mean I I mean we know how that works and

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990
mean I I mean we know how that works and
 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:12.720
mean I I mean we know how that works and
and what's really neat about that is

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730
and what's really neat about that is
 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.350
and what's really neat about that is
that for so many companies now

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360
that for so many companies now
 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.580
that for so many companies now
and just a quick anecdote I helped

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590
and just a quick anecdote I helped
 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.140
and just a quick anecdote I helped
sprint and Samsung develop the new

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150
sprint and Samsung develop the new
 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.119
sprint and Samsung develop the new
instinct phone so the instinct foam was

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:21.129
instinct phone so the instinct foam was
 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:23.789
instinct phone so the instinct foam was
built based on this framework so the

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:23.799
built based on this framework so the
 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:25.830
built based on this framework so the
whole idea behind this is how do you

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840
whole idea behind this is how do you
 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.570
whole idea behind this is how do you
make something habit-forming so I

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580
make something habit-forming so I
 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.070
make something habit-forming so I
thought about this kind of in two very

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080
thought about this kind of in two very
 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.470
thought about this kind of in two very
basic ways one is habit-forming things

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480
basic ways one is habit-forming things
 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.250
basic ways one is habit-forming things
so like there is you know GPS in this

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260
so like there is you know GPS in this
 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.199
so like there is you know GPS in this
phone but most of the time you know

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209
phone but most of the time you know
 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:38.820
phone but most of the time you know
where you're going so most of the time

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830
where you're going so most of the time
 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.250
where you're going so most of the time
you wouldn't be checking the GPS so I'm

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260
you wouldn't be checking the GPS so I'm
 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.210
you wouldn't be checking the GPS so I'm
trying to get people to use it

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220
trying to get people to use it
 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.699
trying to get people to use it
habitually versus using you know Google

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709
habitually versus using you know Google
 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:46.770
habitually versus using you know Google
Maps or using maybe their Garmin or you

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780
Maps or using maybe their Garmin or you
 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.150
Maps or using maybe their Garmin or you
know the system in the car I want them

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160
know the system in the car I want them
 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.920
know the system in the car I want them
using the phone so there's certain

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930
using the phone so there's certain
 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.390
using the phone so there's certain
things that I put in the phone and I had

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400
things that I put in the phone and I had
 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.130
things that I put in the phone and I had
to put in the phone that were you'd use

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140
to put in the phone that were you'd use
 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.569
to put in the phone that were you'd use
all the time so one of things I did was

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:54.579
all the time so one of things I did was
 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:56.880
all the time so one of things I did was
to put traffic on there so that when you

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890
to put traffic on there so that when you
 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.339
to put traffic on there so that when you
go to the maps you have a button you hit

00:02:59.339 --> 00:02:59.349
go to the maps you have a button you hit
 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:01.740
go to the maps you have a button you hit
and gives you traffic because the idea

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750
and gives you traffic because the idea
 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.690
and gives you traffic because the idea
is I live in Atlanta so anybody who's in

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700
is I live in Atlanta so anybody who's in
 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.240
is I live in Atlanta so anybody who's in
a you know in a high commute city every

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250
a you know in a high commute city every
 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:07.170
a you know in a high commute city every
time you get in the car you check

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180
time you get in the car you check
 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.470
time you get in the car you check
traffic and so the idea was you'll do

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480
traffic and so the idea was you'll do
 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.449
traffic and so the idea was you'll do
that every day that will become a habit

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459
that every day that will become a habit
 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:14.610
that every day that will become a habit
and so everything about the phone was

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620
and so everything about the phone was
 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.289
and so everything about the phone was
how are you going you know what would

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:16.299
how are you going you know what would
 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:18.300
how are you going you know what would
you do enough times to make it an

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310
you do enough times to make it an
 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.909
you do enough times to make it an
automatic thing the other part of it is

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:20.919
automatic thing the other part of it is
 

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:23.129
automatic thing the other part of it is
