00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.670
You guys, have you
seen my omelette?

00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:03.775
Because I totally thought
that I just had it.

00:00:03.775 --> 00:00:05.020
I'm really hungry.

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:06.015
Oh, look, a camera.

00:00:11.691 --> 00:00:12.190
Hello.

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:13.690
Welcome to D News,
guys and gals.

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:14.980
Thanks for stopping by.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:15.900
I'm Trace.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.840
As Colorado sees
the implementation

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.710
of legally purchased
marijuana, the drug

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.159
is going to be under
increased scrutiny,

00:00:22.159 --> 00:00:23.950
and we should all be
paranoid that the days

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:25.990
of pot logic being the
only voice in the room

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:26.754
are burned down.

00:00:26.754 --> 00:00:28.170
Pot heads and
friends of pot heads

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.590
alike are familiar with the
idea of twilight memory,

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.814
or memory loss of long
term, heavy users.

00:00:33.814 --> 00:00:35.980
Last year a study by the
proceedings of the National

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.350
Academy of Sciences,
that took 25 years

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.110
to complete, by
the way, determined

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.280
long term use of marijuana
will damage the human brain.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.040
In fact, the study gave IQ
tests to children, and then

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.280
over time, as some picked up
pot and others didn't, they

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.920
continued to test the subjects.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.120
25 years later, those who were
more dependent on cannabis

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.530
scored lower and lower on IQ
tests than those who weren't.

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.540
The results suggested
that pot, over time,

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:01.840
makes you less intelligent.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.110
They even determined
stopping the use of the drug

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.170
didn't return the IQ to normal.

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.850
They can't say with 100%
certainty pot smoking makes

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.090
you dumber, but this is some
pretty compelling stuff.

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.640
Now a new study published
in Schizophrenia Bulletin

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.640
tested specifically
the connection

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.680
between the drug and
memory impairment.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.450
Using brain scanners,
the researchers

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.220
compared normal brains, brains
of those with cannabis use

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.140
disorders, as they
called it, and brains

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:25.567
of those with schizophrenia.

00:01:25.567 --> 00:01:26.900
What they found was significant.

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.920
Those subjects who got blazed
not only had their working

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.210
memory impaired over
time, basically, they

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.740
were more forgetful and had
trouble remembering things,

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.200
but their physical brain
structures changed.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.020
The stereotype of
the forgetful stoner

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.050
doesn't end when they come
down, but instead, their brain

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.700
is physically altered,
perhaps permanently.

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.880
More study is needed to
know how this happens,

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.510
and what it's doing exactly.

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:52.332
Unfortunately, as pot has
been illegal for so long,

00:01:52.332 --> 00:01:54.540
there aren't a good deal of
long term studies looking

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.340
at its effect on
human physiology.

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.350
Now that the legalization
wave has started,

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.310
yes, I assume it's a wave, like
the domino effect, only funner,

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.600
scientists will have more open
access to admitted smokers.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.930
The tetrahrydrocannabinol,
or THC,

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.100
that gets marijuana
users high, has also

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:10.360
been linked to psychosis.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.970
Thus, the
schizophrenia subjects.

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.040
But more research is
needed there, too.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.510
I mean, the casual user hasn't
really been studied at all.

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:18.400
Science.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.950
Get on it.

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.850
Regardless, the idea
that pot is somehow

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.890
magically without a single
negative aspect or effect

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.220
is pretty much completely bunk.

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.090
There are plenty of negatives
to ingesting chemicals, whatever

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.680
they may be, especially
in large quantities.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.902
As the saying goes,
everything in moderation.

00:02:33.902 --> 00:02:35.360
How do you feel
about legalization?

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.740
Is it going to make for
better weed, or worse?

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.410
