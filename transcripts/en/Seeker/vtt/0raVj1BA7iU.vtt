00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.950
The average human being hosts tens of trillions
of microbes in and on our bodies, most of

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:05.990
which reside in our intestines.

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:10.490
Depending on the person, 2-6 pounds of our
entire weight could be purely microbial.

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:13.929
That’s a lot of roommates who aren’t paying
rent, if you ask me.

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:18.689
It turns out these microbial passengers are
both giving back to us and potentially sabotaging

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:19.960
us...

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.929
Scientists are calling this the gut-brain
axis…

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:24.220
And some have even named it your ‘second
brain.’

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.039
It turns out that the teeming and diverse
community in our gut -- acts as a collective

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:30.300
unit with a mind of its own—quite literally.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.109
That’s right—we’re talking microbial
mind control, y’all.

00:00:33.109 --> 00:00:36.590
For example, your bacteria may be making food
choices for you.

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:41.090
Some bacteria love eating fiber, some love
pure sugar or fat—and depending on your

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.260
diet, you may be cultivating a gut population
with a preference for one over the other..

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.910
Whichever your ‘second brain’ prefers,
it’s probably going to to tell you what

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.519
it wants—loudly—and then complain when
you don’t feed it: cue that ‘hangry’

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:57.170
feeling when you just really need a chocolate
bar at 3 pm.

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.050
Your microbes do this by hijacking your neurotransmitters
until you feed them what they want.

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.350
And when you do—there’s a wave a relief
as those bacteria release their happy feelings

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.570
into your system…making you feel happy too.

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.350
This interaction between your cravings, your
microbiome, and how your brain registers all

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.141
of this is really complex, so if you want
to know more just let us know and we’ll

00:01:17.141 --> 00:01:18.141
look into it.

00:01:18.141 --> 00:01:20.810
When your bacteria feel happy, you feel happy
because…

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.300
Bacteria, it turns out, communicate with one
another via neurotransmitter— the same kind

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:30.770
of chemicals used in your regular brain: like
serotonin, dopamine, cortisol, and GABA.

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.409
These chemicals transmit messages from one
neuron to another in your brain, and because

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:40.119
you host so many bacteria -- when they use
them it can affect you--and your mood--too.

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:43.930
The thing is we’re still unclear on how
exactly these signals get from your gut to

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.579
your brain—a likely candidate seems to be
the vagus nerve, a long nerve that connects

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:52.859
your stomach and intestines to the base of
your brain, but it could also be your immune system

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:54.350
or your endocrine system.

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:55.549
Maybe it’s both!

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:59.229
But the results that are coming in from this
kind of research are pretty remarkable.

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:04.079
One research group at University College Cork
in Ireland fed Lactobacillus rhamnosus, a

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:08.250
good bacteria -- or ‘probiotic’ you can
usually find in yogurt -- to one of two groups

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.770
of mice.The probiotic mice were much more
likely to persevere and succeed in the face

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.540
of adversity tests than those not treated
with the probiotic.

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.460
They repeated a similar study in humans, with
the probiotic-fed humans displaying improved

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.030
resilience to negative emotions than those
without the probiotic.

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.590
Some scientists hypothesize that the root
evolutionary cause of this may be that your

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.950
bacteria’s ultimate goal is to spread, so
when we cultivate a healthy gut population,

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.450
the signals they send to our brain are encouraging
us to be happy and social and go out in search

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.280
of food so we introduce them to more hosts…

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.130
So, by shaking each other’s hand or kissing
other people we’re both picking up other

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:48.170
peoples’ bacteria and spreading our personal
microbiomes -- with all the benefits and drawbacks

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:49.170
that entails.

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.320
That’s terrifying.

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.280
There’s all KINDS of crazy ways that the
bugs living inside of you are connected to

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.880
your brain, and its a burgeoning research
field that has great potential for personalized

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:59.880
medicine.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.200
Imagine your doctor sampling your microbiota
and knowing exactly which bacteria were sending

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.400
you what signals and then being able to modify
your behavior, whether it be mood or diet-related,

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.360
by supplementing your gut environment with
some new critters.

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.360
Freaky.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.550

Why not subscribe?

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.080
And watch this video about how antibiotic
resistant bacteria have a new ENEMY in the

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.080
CRISPR pill.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.080
Yeah.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.080
It’s cool.

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.100
Did you know that fecal transplants can potentially
be life-saving?

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.910
That’s right, a transplant of a healthy
donor’s stool could save someone suffering

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:32.680
from a fatal gut infection.

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:33.680
The power of poop!

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.980
Thanks for watching.
