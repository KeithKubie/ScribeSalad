00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.340
I'm sitting here with Mike Wales.

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.360
He is one of our front end developers.

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:05.000
How you doing?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:05.750
&gt;&gt; Good.

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:07.610
So what are we talking about?

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:10.805
&gt;&gt; We're talking about getting things with no context whatsoever.

00:00:10.805 --> 00:00:12.170
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; Like this interview.

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:12.820
&gt;&gt; This interview.

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.080
Okay. &gt;&gt; So, have you ever been in a situation where someone has handed you

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.090
a whole bunch a code, written in a framework you've never seen before?

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.235
&gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; You've never seen this code itself before.

00:00:23.235 --> 00:00:23.910
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.620
&gt;&gt; And you hardly know what it does.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:27.059
And they give you some task to do.

00:00:27.059 --> 00:00:28.720
&gt;&gt; Oh yeah, all the time.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.760
&gt;&gt; All the, really? &gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, it's pretty common.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.120
&gt;&gt; Tell me a little bit about the feeling behind that.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.890
Like what, what does it feel like when someone hands you this big mess?

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:36.880
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.290
It's a daunting task at first because like you said,

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.360
they've handed you a big mess and you have no idea what's going on.

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.330
So you just got to, you kind of have to make a plan of attack.

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.030
And how are you going to figure out what's going on?

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.600
And how are you going to get the right amount of context to

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.470
accomplish the task that's been handed to you?

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.520
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean one of the things is it feels like a big mess,

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.410
not because it necessarily is but because you don't have that context.

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.990
&gt;&gt; It's just new to you.

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.590
Right? &gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:04.489
Yeah.

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.260
So how would you go about getting that context?

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.740
&gt;&gt; The first thing I would do is try and track down what libraries or

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.940
frameworks that application might be using.

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.030
And hopefully it's something popular or something well-documented.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.630
And I would just dive into the documentation of that library or that framework.

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.930
&gt;&gt; Now, are you looking to get a lot of specific information, like

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.280
really become an expert in this framework or are you looking for a big picture?

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:26.850
&gt;&gt; No, not at all.

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.000
Yeah, just a big picture.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.980
Just kind of where is stuff at in this framework.

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:35.170
What are the best practises that this framework establishes just so

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.020
I can figure out, because I mean I have this task I need to accomplish.

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.560
I don't have the time to sit here and learn a whole framework.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.395
So just to kind of,

00:01:41.395 --> 00:01:46.200
or where do I need to look in the application code to get this problem solved?

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.520
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and pretty much all organizational libraries and

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.370
frameworks are the same.

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:50.550
&gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; I mean, they all have models.

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:51.710
They all have collections.

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.060
I mean, they all call them different things, right?

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.750
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.210
&gt;&gt; Like for example, Knockout calls them observable arrays rather than

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:59.580
collections, or something like that.

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.110
&gt;&gt; Yeah, my goal would just be to find out what does this framework call it and

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:04.140
where is it at.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.980
&gt;&gt; Got it. So that's to enable you to figure out, in your code that you've been

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:11.470
given, where to look to implement the feature that you want to implement.

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.510
&gt;&gt; Exactly, otherwise I have to sit there and

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.860
read the entire application code, and who knows how long that's going to be.

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:18.960
&gt;&gt; All right, that makes sense.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.180
So, what about if your framework, or

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.420
library, doesn't have documentation, or doesn't have good documentation?

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:26.738
&gt;&gt; Burn it all down and redo it.

00:02:26.738 --> 00:02:28.510
No. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; Don't do that.

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:29.060
Don't do that.

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.990
&gt;&gt; I'm kidding-

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:32.890
&gt;&gt; Then you just have to, you have to spend the time to

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.460
read through the application code and, and just understand it.

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.920
And you should estimate the time required for

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.020
that task to now be like five times as much as your original estimate.

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.120
&gt;&gt; Mm. So legacy code can be pretty difficult.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.565
&gt;&gt; Absolutely, if it's not documented well.

00:02:45.565 --> 00:02:47.290
Yeah. &gt;&gt; Awesome. Well, thanks for sitting with me, Mike.

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.790
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.
