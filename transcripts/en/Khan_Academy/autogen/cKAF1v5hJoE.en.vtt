00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.865
 In the video about the second law of thermodynamics 

00:00:01.865 --> 00:00:04.210
 I talked about how entropy 

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:06.868
 in the universe is constantly increasing 

00:00:06.868 --> 00:00:09.318
 and will not be reduced. 

00:00:09.318 --> 00:00:12.261
 In other words, the energy 

00:00:12.261 --> 00:00:15.971
 in the universe comes to entropy, 

00:00:15.971 --> 00:00:18.227
 becomes less and less useful. 

00:00:18.227 --> 00:00:21.150
 Proof of this even in our everyday life is, for example, 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.408
 that while I make this video, my body 

00:00:23.408 --> 00:00:26.963
 produces heat and this heat leads to entropy, 

00:00:26.963 --> 00:00:30.056
 leads to more entropy in the universe. 

00:00:30.056 --> 00:00:34.682
 The logical question is "How does heat lead to entropy?". 

00:00:34.682 --> 00:00:39.027
 Remember, heat is a transfer of thermal energy. 

00:00:39.027 --> 00:00:41.867
 Entropy is a state of the system, 

00:00:41.867 --> 00:00:43.236
 number of states, 

00:00:43.236 --> 00:00:46.518
 the amount of disarray we have, 

00:00:46.518 --> 00:00:49.598
 the number of states the system can accept. 

00:00:49.598 --> 00:00:52.436
 Let's give an example. Let's say it is 

00:00:52.436 --> 00:00:55.950
 an ideal closed system, this little white square here. 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.104
 These molecules move at a certain temperature, 

00:00:59.104 --> 00:01:01.182
 have average kinetic energy, 

00:01:01.182 --> 00:01:03.803
 but each molecule will do something different. I always draw molecules 

00:01:03.803 --> 00:01:06.956
 with kinetic energy in the forward motion, but they can rotate, 

00:01:06.956 --> 00:01:09.790
 to tremble and do anything else. 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.584
 They can do different things, 

00:01:12.584 --> 00:01:14.724
 but the kinetic energy in the forward motion is 

00:01:14.724 --> 00:01:17.463
 slightly easier to label. 

00:01:17.463 --> 00:01:20.756
 Now let's put some heat into the system. 

00:01:20.756 --> 00:01:25.214
 We have a transfer of thermal energy, which we call heat. 

00:01:25.214 --> 00:01:28.480
 Let me choose a color, I will use orange and 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.171
 the letter Q to indicate the heat. 

00:01:31.171 --> 00:01:33.085
 We have heat transfer to the system. 

00:01:33.085 --> 00:01:36.089
 Because of this the temperature of this system 

00:01:36.089 --> 00:01:39.488
 rises, the average kinetic energy increases. 

00:01:39.488 --> 00:01:43.339
 These things start bouncing with a bigger impulse 

00:01:43.339 --> 00:01:45.124
 and at a higher speed. 

00:01:45.124 --> 00:01:46.932
 Why does entropy exist in this system? 

00:01:46.932 --> 00:01:48.597
 We can say that both systems 

00:01:48.597 --> 00:01:50.286
 have the same number of molecules, 

00:01:50.286 --> 00:01:53.184
 we also have the same volume. 

00:01:53.184 --> 00:01:55.380
 Here we see the systems in two dimensions and they seem to have only an area, 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.975
 but we can imagine that they have and 

00:01:56.975 --> 00:01:58.873
 equal volume. There seems to be two systems 

00:01:58.873 --> 00:02:01.491
 the same number of places that molecules can hold. 

00:02:01.491 --> 00:02:05.346
 But the state is not determined only by the projections, 

00:02:05.346 --> 00:02:08.045
 which may be different particles in the system. 

00:02:08.045 --> 00:02:10.597
 The state is everything in the system, 

00:02:10.597 --> 00:02:12.334
 which can be used to predict what will be next 

00:02:12.334 --> 00:02:14.772
 something that will happen to the system. Status includes and 

00:02:14.772 --> 00:02:17.932
 the different speeds of these particles. 

00:02:17.932 --> 00:02:19.592
 When we have a higher temperature, 

00:02:19.592 --> 00:02:22.472
 we have a greater number of possible speeds. 

00:02:22.472 --> 00:02:25.223
 we have a greater number of possible speeds. 

00:02:25.223 --> 00:02:27.647
 Also, when we have this higher kinetic energy - 

00:02:27.647 --> 00:02:31.792
 Remember all these molecules in the end 

00:02:31.792 --> 00:02:35.641
 consist of atoms that have nuclei 

00:02:35.641 --> 00:02:37.971
 and electrons that rotate around the nuclei. 

00:02:37.971 --> 00:02:40.369
 And if they do not have big kinetic energy, 

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:42.141
 the atoms will not be able to get very close together. 

00:02:42.141 --> 00:02:44.963
 Let's say these are the external electrons of an atom, 

00:02:44.963 --> 00:02:47.318
 and that 

00:02:47.318 --> 00:02:49.936
 is another atom. 

00:02:49.936 --> 00:02:52.505
 If they had not very high kinetic energy, 

00:02:52.505 --> 00:02:54.598
 if they have not very high kinetic energy, 

00:02:54.598 --> 00:02:56.804
 may 

00:02:56.804 --> 00:02:58.591
 are able to get closer to this position. 

00:02:58.591 --> 00:03:01.805
 But if they ran and hit 

00:03:01.805 --> 00:03:04.268
 much faster, they can get closer. 

00:03:04.268 --> 00:03:07.718
 They can flatten one another. 

00:03:07.718 --> 00:03:10.127
 If you imagine two balls that hit one another, 

00:03:10.127 --> 00:03:13.031
 if they hit much faster, each will exert more pressure 

00:03:13.031 --> 00:03:15.052
 on the other. So there is a bigger one 

00:03:15.052 --> 00:03:16.932
 number of possible states, 

00:03:16.932 --> 00:03:19.013
 when we have higher kinetic energy. 

00:03:19.013 --> 00:03:21.771
 These two atoms have struck 

00:03:21.771 --> 00:03:23.859
 at a high speed and "flattened" one another, 

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:25.292
 while these were good and educated 

00:03:25.292 --> 00:03:28.502
 and they met with nice moderate speed. 

00:03:28.502 --> 00:03:31.552
 We can have even more positional states, 

00:03:31.552 --> 00:03:35.449
 more different configurations in three-dimensional space. 

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:39.906
 That's why heat leads to entropy. 

00:03:39.906 --> 00:03:41.895
 I know what you're saying now, 

00:03:41.895 --> 00:03:45.603
 "The heat does not only cause chaos, 

00:03:45.603 --> 00:03:48.230
 heat can also be used to work. " 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.002
 This is the basis, this is part of the foundation 

00:03:50.002 --> 00:03:51.658
 of the Industrial Revolution, 

00:03:51.658 --> 00:03:53.209
 steam engines, internal combustion engines - 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:55.766
 the internal combustion engine in your car uses heat, 

00:03:55.766 --> 00:03:58.449
 uses a flame reaction, the burning gases are expanded 

00:03:58.449 --> 00:04:02.803
 and push a piston that is used to work. 

00:04:02.803 --> 00:04:05.965
 This, of course, is true. 

00:04:05.965 --> 00:04:08.778
 Here we have an example. 

00:04:08.778 --> 00:04:12.504
 I have a few molecules that are driving around 

00:04:12.504 --> 00:04:15.183
 with a certain temperature. Then 

00:04:15.183 --> 00:04:17.610
 will add some heat to the system. 

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:21.992
 Add heat to the system. 

00:04:21.992 --> 00:04:25.628
 In this system I have no boundaries. 

00:04:25.628 --> 00:04:27.642
 Molecules can move here, 

00:04:27.642 --> 00:04:29.906
 to accept different states, etc., 

00:04:29.906 --> 00:04:32.658
 but they can also expand the court. 

00:04:32.658 --> 00:04:35.538
 What we see here is that the molecules push the plunger. 

00:04:35.538 --> 00:04:38.610
 Push the plunger up, ie. we have a job. 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.351
 I will color the work in another color. 

00:04:41.351 --> 00:04:44.229
 We have a job. 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:47.138
 I'll make the arrow smaller. 

00:04:47.138 --> 00:04:49.973
 Here we have a job. 

00:04:49.973 --> 00:04:51.214
 How is this work done? 

00:04:51.214 --> 00:04:52.887
 All these things are jumping around, 

00:04:52.887 --> 00:04:55.543
 we talk about many molecules. 

00:04:55.543 --> 00:04:57.026
 From time to time some of these molecules 

00:04:57.026 --> 00:04:59.217
 I'll hit here and bounce. 

00:04:59.217 --> 00:05:01.541
 This will provide strength to many 

00:05:01.541 --> 00:05:04.267
 a short time that will push the piston gently. 

00:05:04.267 --> 00:05:06.089
 But we have many molecules. 

00:05:06.089 --> 00:05:08.202
 I've just painted some of them, 

00:05:08.202 --> 00:05:10.632
 but in any real thermodynamic system we talk 

00:05:10.632 --> 00:05:13.197
 for millions, millions and millions of molecules. 

00:05:13.197 --> 00:05:15.656
 We are talking about number of molecules, 

00:05:15.656 --> 00:05:19.144
 the number of Avogadro. 

00:05:19.144 --> 00:05:21.076
 So at any moment, many will 

00:05:21.076 --> 00:05:22.947
 are pushed out of the piston, will 

00:05:22.947 --> 00:05:24.711
 do the work, push and go 

00:05:24.711 --> 00:05:27.608
 will move the piston in the direction 

00:05:27.608 --> 00:05:29.801
 of power or of part of its power, 

00:05:29.801 --> 00:05:33.955
 will push this plunger up and work. 

00:05:33.955 --> 00:05:37.966
 We can say no heat engine 

00:05:37.966 --> 00:05:41.109
 or system can not be 100% effective. 

00:05:41.109 --> 00:05:43.954
 Part of the heat can be used to perform work, 

00:05:43.954 --> 00:05:47.164
 but much of it will be used to increase the disorder 

00:05:47.164 --> 00:05:50.364
 in the system, to increase the number of states, 

00:05:50.364 --> 00:05:52.170
 which the system can accept. 

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:54.627
 One way of explaining that always helps me is that 

00:05:54.627 --> 00:05:57.506
 heat is a heat transfer, 

00:05:57.506 --> 00:05:59.480
 which happens at the boundaries of the system. 

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.407
 The heat can 

00:06:01.407 --> 00:06:03.966
 to come from a flame down here. 

00:06:03.966 --> 00:06:05.685
 And if the system was not completely closed, 

00:06:05.685 --> 00:06:08.035
 he could at his borders 

00:06:08.035 --> 00:06:09.899
 to give heat. 

00:06:09.899 --> 00:06:13.598
 But inside the system, heat only leads to 

00:06:13.598 --> 00:06:17.299
 increasing heat, which leads to increased entropy. 

00:06:17.299 --> 00:06:19.871
 Work is also done at the boundary of the system. 

00:06:19.871 --> 00:06:22.509
 There may be some released heat here, 

00:06:22.509 --> 00:06:24.768
 who can also work. 

00:06:24.768 --> 00:06:26.802
 The heat and the work are on 

00:06:26.802 --> 00:06:29.710
 the limits of the system, but much of that energy 

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:32.484
 reaches the inside of the system. 

00:06:32.484 --> 00:06:34.619
 And here the situation looks like a pog, 

00:06:34.619 --> 00:06:36.632
 these molecules will hit each other much faster, 

00:06:36.632 --> 00:06:38.818
 in many more states than they can take. 

00:06:38.818 --> 00:06:40.874
 Another example is that when 

00:06:40.874 --> 00:06:42.798
 move and walk on the floor, 

00:06:42.798 --> 00:06:44.933
 only carpet friction will create heat. 

00:06:44.933 --> 00:06:47.126
 It will contribute to entropy in the universe. 

00:06:47.126 --> 00:06:50.097
 Even my very existence, the cellular processes in my body, 

00:06:50.097 --> 00:06:53.089
 which create warmth, increase entropy 

00:06:53.089 --> 00:06:55.419
 in the universe and make the total energy in the universe 

00:06:55.419 --> 00:06:58.699
 less useful.
