advantage and one of the lessons we can
 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.530
advantage and one of the lessons we can
draw from that is if you understand what

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540

date that gives you leverage in the

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:57.690
date that gives you leverage in the
 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.420

involved but but if they have to sell
 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.330
involved but but if they have to sell
then that gives you additional leverage

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340
then that gives you additional leverage
 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.279
then that gives you additional leverage
that you can use to lower the price to

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289
that you can use to lower the price to
 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.070
that you can use to lower the price to
improve the terms to do any number of
