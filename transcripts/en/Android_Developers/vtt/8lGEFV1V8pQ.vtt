JOSEPH COHEN: All right,
how's everybody doing today?

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.050
Participation will be
rewarded with Seattle pins,

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:13.090
kiddoEMR Seattle pins we went.

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:20.260
They're Rocky Mountain pins,
stainless steel, and cloisonne.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:21.610
Nothing but the best.

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:24.880
Unless you have a nickel
allergy, then don't sue me.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:25.810
Just saying.

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:27.130
There's nothing left, people.

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:28.020
There's nothing left.

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.960
It's like bleeding a
stone, not going to happen.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.220
My name's Dr. Joe,
Dr. Joe Cohen,

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.430
board certified pediatrician.

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.030
And I'm also founder
and former CEO,

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.050
now Chief Medical
Officer, of kiddoEMR

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.650
and Unificare Limited in
Austin, Texas and London,

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:43.580
England respectively.

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:47.280
Today we're going to talk about
developing apps for health

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.400
care.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.260
We're not going to be talking
about how to program them,

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.220
but we're going to talk
about the Med Dev zone

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.610
and how we are going to be
lending our expertise to you

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.070
guys to help hack
health care, to build

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:02.665
hashtag apps with impact.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.590
I'm a board certified
pediatrician.

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:16.670
I finished med school
in 1999 when I was 14.

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.600
And did my residency
in general pediatrics

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.840
at Mount Sinai University
in New York City.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.760
And then I moved
to Austin, Texas

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.530
and founded Cedar
Park Pediatrics.

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.380
We're now 10 years old with a
history of 5,000 patient charts

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.882
and over 3,500 active patients.

00:01:33.882 --> 00:01:35.340
We were voted the
best pediatrician

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.860
in Cedar Park, Texas which
is a suburb north of Austin.

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.870
And we're very honored
to be able to be parts

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.020
of so many people's lives.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.910
I'm also the founder and Chief
Medical Officer, as I said,

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:47.070
of kiddoEMR.

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.000
I've also been elected to
the advisory board of IDEAA,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.860
where I will help
developers engage

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.440
health care with technology in
credible and meaningful ways.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.950
The last thing I'm
here to do is lecture.

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.320
I really like discussions.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.082
So I encourage
people to disrupt me.

00:02:06.082 --> 00:02:07.290
I'll just throw a pin at you.

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.250
It's as simple as that.

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.140
So please raise your hand,
stand up, say you're wrong.

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.592
We can debate it, go
outside and fight.

00:02:15.592 --> 00:02:16.720
It'll be fine.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:17.470
All right?

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:18.210
Good.

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.120
So what is our mission?

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.580
Why am I here?

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.250
Why am I not seeing
my patients today?

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.370
My mission is to harness
the power of Android

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.550
to develop meaningful solutions
that are credible and compliant

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.270
with the law at scale.

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.810
One of the things that's
made kiddoEMR so successful

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.080
is architecture.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.337
And we're able to produce
solutions for scale,

00:02:41.337 --> 00:02:43.170
not just for one people,
not just for people

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.300
that can afford iPads, not
just for the people that

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.750
have app store accounts.

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.360
We are a global thin
client, cloud based,

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.370
electronic medical record
platform for pediatricians,

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.780
parents, and institutions.

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.720
We do not market
directly to children.

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.420
And if you're going to
make apps for health care,

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.260
you may want to
keep that in mind.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.530
They're not your audience.

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.590
Your audience are their parents.

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.700
You really are
opening a bag of worms

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.490
if you're not building
a game for children.

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:14.930
If you're building some
sort of health care app,

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.900
it's going to become a major
hurdle to get it approved

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.550
and released and not sued.

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:25.370
So what's the problem?

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.550
The problem is that
in the United States,

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:31.460
health care spending
is out of control.

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:33.970
This statistic is
very well known.

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.960
We spend $2.9 trillion in
health care every year.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.380
That's more per capita than
any nation in the world.

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.610
It's also more than any
nation in the world.

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.800
The problem is that only
1.9 trillion of that

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.290
actually goes to your health.

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:56.640
And $1 trillion is thrown
in the garbage in waste,

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.160
inefficiencies, poor practicing,
duplication of services,

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:07.280
omission of services,
readmission, noncompliance.

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.490
Anyone been to the
doctor recently?

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:13.740
OK, so how much
of the information

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:16.450
did you take home
from the visit?

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:18.480
0 or three?

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.284
OK, it's funny you
should say that.

00:04:20.284 --> 00:04:22.089
There you go.

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:24.230
Sorry, I'm a bad arm.

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:27.212
I went to med school, people.

00:04:27.212 --> 00:04:28.670
When everyone else
was making money

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:30.310
off Dell in the stock
market, I was learning

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:31.518
about anatomy and physiology.

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:35.455
In the long run, I won.

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:39.260
Thank you.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:40.325
Welcome, guys, welcome.

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.340
What Mark brought
up and what I'm

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.860
trying to make the point is,
at the end of your visit,

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.870
what does the doctor
spend time doing with you?

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:56.280
He educates you about why you
came here in the first place.

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:01.530
Statistics show that no matter
how much the pediatrician talks

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:05.820
to the parents, no matter how
much time he takes to explain,

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:12.700
you take at the max three
information points home.

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:15.890
I believe this is one of
the fundamental reasons why

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:19.300
we take $1 trillion and
throw it in the garbage.

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:23.650
Because I see patients all the
time come back to me saying,

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:26.900
we did what you said
and he's not better.

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:28.560
And they didn't do what I said.

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.680
They did what they
thought they heard me say.

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.430
And because there's
no credible technology

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.980
to transfer information
from a doctor to a patient,

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:37.670
we're missing follow ups.

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:39.680
We're missing follow
through and we're

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.340
missing patient compliance.

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.270
Every mistake made
in health care,

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:49.100
whether it's intentional or not,
costs us money in the long run.

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:52.340
If you're a diabetic and you're
being treated for ketoacidosis,

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:55.520
which is a very bad
thing, you basically

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:59.520
spend a week and a half in
ICU, three days in step down,

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.220
and five minutes at discharge.

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:04.820
Why aren't there platforms
where information

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:06.920
can be transferred
to the patient where

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:10.860
the patient can engage their
care provider after discharge?

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:15.660
Well, this is the result.
$1 trillion into the trash.

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:18.810
$1 trillion because of poor
health information management.

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:23.590
$1 trillion due to poor
litigation and liabilities.

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:26.820
All right, now let's move on.

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:30.160
Until recently, as a
physician, a physician

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.710
who's very engaged in
the tech community,

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:35.830
I had no medical
apps on this phone.

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:37.060
None.

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:39.110
None of them are worth my time.

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:40.090
Recently found one.

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:43.330
It's called Figure 1.

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:44.230
I didn't develop it.

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:45.550
It's an app for doctors.

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:46.944
It's like Instagram for doctors.

00:06:46.944 --> 00:06:49.360
We get to show you all of our
patient rashes, and everyone

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:49.974
comments.

00:06:49.974 --> 00:06:51.390
It's in a HIPAA
compliant fashion,

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:54.240
but it's the first
engaging platform for me.

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:57.284
And there's just very
few clinically relevant

00:06:57.284 --> 00:06:58.700
applications that
exist and that's

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:00.830
kind of why where we
live and why I started.

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:02.780
So what's the solution?

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:06.790
Some of you may have seen me
last year at Big Android BBQ.

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:08.860
And the community
really inspired

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:11.930
me to come up with
a platform to stand

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:16.930
on where we can crowd source
with physician involvement that

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:21.910
encourages innovative thinking
and also helps us disseminate

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:23.180
our innovative platform.

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:25.350
And we're going to go into
what our platform does

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:27.980
and what you guys will
be able to do with it

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:30.620
as you develop solutions
for health care.

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:33.870
The flop sweat in
here is pretty-- I

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:36.380
feel like Kathy Griffin.

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:38.710
So what's the purpose is
that we want, like I said,

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:40.400
we want to engage the community.

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:44.460
We want to make and make
clear very discreet parameters

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:45.520
and protocols.

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:49.000
And also provide you with
a robust test environment

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.130
of granular anonymized data in
which to enforce information

00:07:54.130 --> 00:08:00.580
transfer, follow up,
communications, ratings,

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:03.360
diagnostics, evaluation.

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:06.854
And we're going to add
care value to the platform

00:08:06.854 --> 00:08:08.145
and to the process of medicine.

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:12.180
Any questions so far?

00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:14.510
These are some of the
hashtags we've been using.

00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:15.510
Apps with impact.

00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:19.210
It all goes back to where's my
health care app with impact?

00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:21.160
Where's my Facebook for doctors?

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:24.596
Where's my end to end
encrypted chat app

00:08:24.596 --> 00:08:25.970
so that I can talk
to my patients

00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:27.800
without violating federal law?

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:29.020
They don't exist.

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:32.780
And if they do, they're
built by large corporations

00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:34.370
and they are convoluted.

00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:38.230
They're not side by side and
they cost thousands of dollars

00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:39.740
a month.

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:43.870
Apparently people still
think we make a lot of money.

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:46.580
Yes, we make money and
we do it consistently,

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:49.330
unless you do something bad and
are put out of your profession.

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:52.930
But the fact is that
in today's day and age,

00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:55.920
we haven't gotten pay
raises in decades.

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:57.570
But that's not why I'm here.

00:08:57.570 --> 00:09:00.592
Why I'm here is because we're
going to disrupt health care.

00:09:00.592 --> 00:09:03.050
We're going to take it back
from the large corporations who

00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:04.440
are non-physicians
who are trying

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:05.564
to develop for health care.

00:09:05.564 --> 00:09:08.010
And they're making our industry
more convoluted and less

00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:08.930
efficient.

00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:10.170
And that hurts who?

00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:11.570
Does it hurt me?

00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:13.320
Yeah, I complain about
it for five minutes

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:14.236
at the end of the day.

00:09:14.236 --> 00:09:15.800
But ultimately who does it hurt?

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:18.550
All these children here.

00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:20.830
They're the ones that it hurts.

00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:23.150
They're the ones that
gets suboptimal care.

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:26.220
They're the ones that have to
wait so long during the visit

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:28.426
to see their doctor that
by the time the end comes,

00:09:28.426 --> 00:09:29.800
where the real
meat of the matter

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:33.200
is, the reason you're there in
the first place, it's like, OK,

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:34.720
I'll see you later.

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:35.940
That's unacceptable.

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:39.930
We can't do it and
we're not sustainable.

00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:41.490
So why kiddoEMR?

00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:43.850
With kiddoEMR, especially
in the last year,

00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:47.180
we have established two
outlets for your development--

00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:50.230
the United States and
the international market.

00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:53.600
Unificare Limited, our exclusive
reseller in London, England,

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:56.690
is going to adjust UK and India
and eventually beyond where

00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:59.430
your technology
can be incorporated

00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:01.660
into what we're trying to do.

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:03.800
And we'll also be
giving you guidelines

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:07.310
on how to address unique
demographic populations.

00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:08.870
Remember that with
a genetic pool

00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:10.470
comes differences
in medicine, comes

00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:12.470
differences in
treatment and outcome.

00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:15.739
One of the very simple
examples is vaccinations.

00:10:15.739 --> 00:10:17.280
The United States
vaccination program

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:20.120
is a little bit different than
the UK, but really different

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:20.980
from India.

00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:25.290
Because of our architecture,
we can adapt the protocol APIs

00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:28.030
for that, adapt the
scheduling for that.

00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:33.190
But we really believe in an
open architecture, open source.

00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:34.810
I explain it this way.

00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:37.060
Our technology is not the
Electronic Medical Record.

00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:39.950
As a matter of fact,
our EMR is open source.

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:42.110
The technology is what
we do with the data.

00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:42.940
Think about this.

00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:45.920
When everyone was using
a quill and parchment,

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:46.840
that was technology.

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:48.881
The pen and paper came
out and it was technology.

00:10:48.881 --> 00:10:51.170
But today it's just
a pen and paper.

00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:52.468
And that's where we're going.

00:10:52.468 --> 00:10:54.217
Eventually EMR and the
data entry platform

00:10:54.217 --> 00:10:55.920
is really not going
to be the technology.

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:58.170
But what you do with the
data, how you incorporate it,

00:10:58.170 --> 00:11:00.500
how you stream it, and
how you integrate it

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:03.430
with patients and doctors'
lives, that's our technology.

00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:06.190
When we're using open APIs
and an agile architecture

00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:08.840
in which to address very
customized populations

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:10.750
in a very customizable way.

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:15.090
By the spring 2016 we will
have an anonymized test data

00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:18.760
pool, a test pool of data
where your applications will

00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:20.480
be able to use
these demographics

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:24.419
and medical indices and values
in which to sandbox your apps

00:11:24.419 --> 00:11:25.210
and play with them.

00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:34.120
As a company, we have four
legs that we stand on.

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:36.820
We're an EMR, which stands
for Electronic Medical

00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:42.250
Record, data, which stands
for data, health information

00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:45.850
exchange in an API, Automated
Programming Interface, program

00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:47.170
company.

00:11:47.170 --> 00:11:49.610
We are built to be platform
and device agnostic.

00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:50.670
We're built for Chrome.

00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:53.410
We believe in open APIs,
internet of things support.

00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:57.550
And we actually have Google
Glass support for image upload.

00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:59.030
Some of the milestones.

00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:01.590
We went live at my practice
in Cedar Park Pediatrics

00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:07.360
in February 2015, which
was quite a day for us.

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:09.850
I remember with the
agile architecture

00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:12.110
and thin clienting,
we went live.

00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:14.260
And there were some
residual bugs left,

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:18.610
but my co-founder literally
was changing things on the fly

00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:20.710
and we were moving and
moving and grooving.

00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:23.790
Since going live at
my practice, before we

00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:27.430
had kiddoEMR where we were
using another EMR client.

00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:30.660
It cost us roughly the national
average to process one patient

00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:33.500
visit, $58.

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:36.830
We now pay $17.60.

00:12:36.830 --> 00:12:40.220
My doctors work four days a
week seeing about 25 patients

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:44.770
where most practices work six
days a week seeing 40 a day.

00:12:44.770 --> 00:12:47.650
And our patients have
benefited for it.

00:12:47.650 --> 00:12:49.760
Between that time
and around May, we

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:51.800
realized we had something.

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:55.690
And we went and filed the
entity and started our business

00:12:55.690 --> 00:12:57.190
structure.

00:12:57.190 --> 00:12:58.650
And then I think
you guys may have

00:12:58.650 --> 00:13:02.490
seen me last October
[INAUDIBLE] ranting lunatic.

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:06.170
By May we had founded
our company in London.

00:13:06.170 --> 00:13:08.950
And now here I'm
here to announce

00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:11.350
in our minimum viable product
for our patient portal

00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:14.790
and release candidate for
our verification trials.

00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:16.020
And we're ready to scale.

00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:20.430
So it's an exciting
time for us and you.

00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:23.126
My slides are a little
bit out of order.

00:13:23.126 --> 00:13:24.750
Does anybody have
any questions so far?

00:13:27.310 --> 00:13:28.280
So how does this work?

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:30.600
How does the kiddoEMR
developer core, the Med Dev

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:33.390
zone, and kiddoEMR and Unificare
and Dr. Joe and [INAUDIBLE],

00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:34.760
how does this all go together?

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:38.470
Well, this first step is we
want innovation proposals

00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:40.779
and discovery, demonstrations.

00:13:40.779 --> 00:13:43.320
Some of them are going to come
out of the code kitchen today,

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:44.270
I hope.

00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:46.450
Value add propositions
to our platform.

00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:49.030
Then we're going to collaborate
together with the kiddoEMR

00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:49.860
developer core.

00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:53.100
And there'll a link at the end
to join that private community.

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:56.480
And what our physicians will do
will provide ethical oversight

00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:59.410
to the technology you're trying
to implement in health care.

00:13:59.410 --> 00:14:01.460
Remember, in health
care specially,

00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:04.800
just because it can be done,
especially, with children

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:08.100
doesn't mean it should be done.

00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:09.985
We don't want SnapChat for STDs.

00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:15.307
I'm sorry, kids.

00:14:15.307 --> 00:14:16.640
Sexually transmitted infections.

00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:21.210
Herpes, you know.

00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:24.110
That type of thing.

00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:28.750
I'm treading on
shallow ground here.

00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:31.330
Are any of your parents here?

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:34.130
OK, good.

00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:35.680
Don't tell them
you saw me today.

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:40.630
But ethical oversight's
very important.

00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:42.610
And that kind of
has to do with why

00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:45.920
I've moved over from Chief
Executive Officer to Chief

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:46.710
Medical Officer.

00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:47.650
As a matter of
fact, the President

00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:49.733
of the American Academy
of Pediatrics on LinkedIn,

00:14:49.733 --> 00:14:53.000
he's like, congratulations
on your promotion.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.850
Which I didn't really
see it that way.

00:14:54.850 --> 00:14:58.470
I was like, but I
want to be in charge.

00:14:58.470 --> 00:15:00.870
But after seeing what
[? Raj, ?] our CEO in London

00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:02.930
has to deal with,
I'm like, thank God

00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:05.250
I don't have to do that.

00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:06.840
And step three is publish.

00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:07.340
Publish.

00:15:10.390 --> 00:15:12.670
So what is the technology?

00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:16.020
This was actually taken
through glass in my office.

00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:20.430
I have permission to share
this, so don't call the lawyers.

00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:21.380
So our technology.

00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:22.254
We talked about this.

00:15:22.254 --> 00:15:24.500
EMR data API and HIE.

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:27.780
Let's start with EMR,
Electronic Medical Record.

00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:29.460
Pretty simple.

00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:33.950
We basically are a data entry
portal with a HIPAA compliant

00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:38.290
database for the entrance and
maintenance of your health care

00:15:38.290 --> 00:15:40.270
information.

00:15:40.270 --> 00:15:42.240
Whose doctor uses an
EMR here, anybody?

00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:50.100
You need to find other doctors.

00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:51.770
Who's writing on paper?

00:15:51.770 --> 00:15:54.820
They walk in, their
doctor writes on paper.

00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:55.870
Paper.

00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:56.520
It's not bad.

00:15:56.520 --> 00:16:00.270
It's pretty much the way
it is, unfortunately.

00:16:00.270 --> 00:16:01.170
It's sad.

00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:03.882
Does anyone want to know
why their doctor's probably

00:16:03.882 --> 00:16:04.840
still writing on paper?

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:07.240
Anyone have any ideas?

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:08.314
Yes.

00:16:08.314 --> 00:16:09.230
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:10.063
JOSEPH COHEN: Funds.

00:16:10.063 --> 00:16:11.450
Smart kid.

00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:12.570
Here, take my card.

00:16:12.570 --> 00:16:14.300
Here, give him a pin.

00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:16.610
Give him a pin.

00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:18.360
I should probably take
them out of the bag

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:19.855
first before I throw them.

00:16:19.855 --> 00:16:20.870
It's aerodynamics.

00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:22.750
Physics was never
my strong suit.

00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:23.985
Yes, another one.

00:16:23.985 --> 00:16:24.860
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:32.870
JOSEPH COHEN: Excellent.

00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:34.500
Back up and contingency.

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:35.105
Yes.

00:16:35.105 --> 00:16:35.980
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:44.560
JOSEPH COHEN: OK, so dictation
and dictation interfacing.

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:45.431
Yes.

00:16:45.431 --> 00:16:46.306
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:49.914 --> 00:16:51.580
JOSEPH COHEN: These
guys are rock stars.

00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:53.121
I don't know any of
them, by the way.

00:16:53.121 --> 00:16:55.240
I didn't ask them to come here.

00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:57.260
One more.

00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:59.339
On the right there.

00:16:59.339 --> 00:17:00.630
Both of you will have a chance.

00:17:00.630 --> 00:17:01.860
Don't fight.

00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:02.841
Pick a first.

00:17:02.841 --> 00:17:03.716
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:06.410 --> 00:17:07.510
JOSEPH COHEN: On paper?

00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:10.400
OK, what happens if
you lose it though?

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:12.300
No indexing, right?

00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:14.790
Dewey Decimal system?

00:17:14.790 --> 00:17:18.150
Do you guys know what
Dewey Decimal system is?

00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:20.280
Well, I'm old, I know.

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:22.710
And you would go to
the library and you

00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:24.959
would go through the Dewey
Decimal system, you walk in

00:17:24.959 --> 00:17:26.010
and the book's not there.

00:17:26.010 --> 00:17:27.680
Then what do you do?

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:28.960
Do you go to the search bar?

00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:36.110
The search bar at my
library served coffee.

00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:37.410
Anyone else?

00:17:37.410 --> 00:17:38.351
Yes.

00:17:38.351 --> 00:17:39.226
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:56.847
JOSEPH COHEN: Yes.

00:17:56.847 --> 00:17:58.680
All right, everybody
that answers something,

00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:02.860
you've all got jobs in our
new marketing department.

00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:05.860
So we've heard ease of use.

00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:10.040
We've heard archaic technology.

00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:11.830
We're hearing my phone go viral.

00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:14.090
Thank you, everybody.

00:18:14.090 --> 00:18:17.600
We've heard expense, et cetera.

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:20.050
Every one of you are correct.

00:18:20.050 --> 00:18:21.300
Absolutely correct.

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:24.160
And as a doctor
making this company,

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:28.340
I have done my very best to be
a domain expert establishing

00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:30.040
solutions that are credible.

00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:32.310
And this is what
doctors will tell you

00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:37.110
when it comes to why they don't
like or are not using an EMR.

00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:39.880
Remember that the doctor usually
doesn't have the decision.

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:42.280
Usually they work for
somebody who says, look,

00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:43.710
we have this great new system.

00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:47.440
Let's go for training for
a week on your Saturdays

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:49.430
to learn how to use it.

00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:52.900
You may not know this,
but as physicians we're

00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:55.620
horribly obsessive compulsive.

00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:57.500
As a matter of fact,
the obsessive compulsive

00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:01.890
personality type is 130%
more common in physicians

00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:04.020
than it is in the
general population.

00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:05.450
Why is that?

00:19:05.450 --> 00:19:10.150
Remember that if your guy that
you do your tires doesn't fill

00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:15.250
a tire up, forgets to do it, you
walk back, you say tire's flat.

00:19:15.250 --> 00:19:19.250
But if I forget to do something,
it could be life or death.

00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:21.850
And as a result, with
our OC personalities,

00:19:21.850 --> 00:19:25.250
we always do things by
the same procedural.

00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:27.400
Like for instance,
in the last 15 years,

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:30.050
I've never approached a
patient on the left hand side.

00:19:30.050 --> 00:19:32.680
I was trained to do it on
the right, that's what I do.

00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:35.540
I start here and I work my way.

00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:38.550
But in EMR, especially
those built by developers,

00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:41.030
are asking doctors to reproach
on the left hand side.

00:19:41.030 --> 00:19:43.200
They're hijacking our process.

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:47.190
And that is no longer
acceptable, in my opinion.

00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:50.210
They believe that
it can't be better.

00:19:50.210 --> 00:19:52.890
They don't have time to
learn how to develop.

00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:57.190
They don't have time, like
myself, to show their passion

00:19:57.190 --> 00:19:58.870
and try to disrupt the industry.

00:19:58.870 --> 00:20:00.970
So we're going to
do it for them.

00:20:00.970 --> 00:20:02.770
And we're going to
show them that they

00:20:02.770 --> 00:20:05.540
can do it the way that
they've been taught to do it.

00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:08.440
If you hijack a doctor's
process of care,

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:10.230
they're going to make mistakes.

00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:13.380
And doctors are really sick of
having to bend over backwards

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:15.280
to accommodate their EMR.

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:17.230
I've spoken to a lot of
my colleagues and even

00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:19.060
new doctor friends.

00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:22.310
The most common thing they
hear at a demonstration

00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:25.230
is when they make
a feature request,

00:20:25.230 --> 00:20:28.260
I want to be able to do A,
B, and C. The number one

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:30.670
thing they hear from the
developers is, you're not

00:20:30.670 --> 00:20:32.480
going to want to do that.

00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:34.700
This is how it works
with our system.

00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:38.390
And that, I'm sorry,
is unacceptable.

00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:42.080
In the era of Facebook,
in the era of Google,

00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:45.110
when we can track our
ex-boyfriend or girlfriend like

00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:51.100
a stalker and then we say to
the doctor, oh, but you can't.

00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:53.540
You got to follow them by foot.

00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:56.595
The analogy's thin, but very
important to understand.

00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:02.520
But we talked about, well,
the technology's not the EMR.

00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:04.800
So what are we doing here?

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:08.250
Well, it's the data
that's the real win here.

00:21:08.250 --> 00:21:11.240
By defacing data, it
becomes anonymized

00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:12.940
and becomes granular.

00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:15.170
It's granular and it
becomes extremely pliable.

00:21:15.170 --> 00:21:18.400
And we can make conclusions
with that data that have never

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:19.700
been able to be made before.

00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:21.429
Yes, question?

00:21:21.429 --> 00:21:22.304
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:25.930
JOSEPH COHEN: The
amount of money it

00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:27.960
costs to go through the system.

00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:29.492
Thank you.

00:21:29.492 --> 00:21:30.325
Thank you very much.

00:21:34.590 --> 00:21:38.740
I'm broke, don't sue me.

00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:40.620
No, they got caps on it.

00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:42.954
It's all right, I got my
stitch kit in the back.

00:21:42.954 --> 00:21:44.930
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:44.930 --> 00:21:46.295
I have tetanus shots too.

00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:51.890
All right, I'll have
someone pass it back, Joe.

00:21:51.890 --> 00:21:54.350
Did you guys get it?

00:21:54.350 --> 00:21:54.930
Pass it back.

00:21:59.290 --> 00:22:01.432
Anyways, this is a really
overly convoluted slide

00:22:01.432 --> 00:22:02.390
that I'm going to skip.

00:22:02.390 --> 00:22:04.560
This one, though, however,
shows a little bit more

00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:07.010
of what architecture is like.

00:22:07.010 --> 00:22:09.810
Basically if you see this--
does that show up there?

00:22:09.810 --> 00:22:12.260
OK, so because
we're in the cloud,

00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:15.350
because nothing exists in
the physician's office,

00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:17.840
he can take his practice
based access or even

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:19.960
remote access from home.

00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:21.530
I can see patients
on my way home,

00:22:21.530 --> 00:22:24.690
actually, if they're
on the way, of course.

00:22:24.690 --> 00:22:26.420
Then we have a remote
hosting service

00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:28.860
where we use drive level
encryption and a private HIPAA

00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:29.910
cloud.

00:22:29.910 --> 00:22:32.270
And then around that, we
build this analytic cloud,

00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:34.380
which is the anonymized data.

00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:37.710
But you can also see here
that other people who

00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:40.000
have been credentialed
can access information

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.170
that's relevant to them with
granular access control lists.

00:22:43.170 --> 00:22:47.055
For instance, the school
nurse that is near my office.

00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:54.640
It is possible for her to
have an account into our chart

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:58.290
so that her students, she can
have all of their shot records,

00:22:58.290 --> 00:23:05.180
any notes excusing them
from school, any medication

00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:06.620
authorizations.

00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:08.890
Who's a parent?

00:23:08.890 --> 00:23:11.370
What do you have to do,
Stacy, when your school wants

00:23:11.370 --> 00:23:13.484
your shot record for your kid?

00:23:13.484 --> 00:23:15.750
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:18.630
JOSEPH COHEN: OK, Stacy's
not a good-- Stacy?

00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:19.130
No?

00:23:19.130 --> 00:23:20.810
OK, anybody else?

00:23:20.810 --> 00:23:22.816
Yes, what do you have to do?

00:23:22.816 --> 00:23:25.510
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:31.070
JOSEPH COHEN: Go to the doctor,
get it signed, go to school,

00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:31.570
drop it off.

00:23:31.570 --> 00:23:32.830
I didn't make it up.

00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:34.640
Don't look at me like that.

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:36.170
But OK, you go to the doctor.

00:23:36.170 --> 00:23:37.880
Do they give it right to you?

00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:39.190
No.

00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:42.690
You have to then go to
the doctor, ask for it,

00:23:42.690 --> 00:23:46.480
go home, wait for a call,
go back to the doctor.

00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:48.700
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:52.790
JOSEPH COHEN: Which they're
not allowed to mail it.

00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:53.620
Why?

00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:55.100
Whiskey tango foxtrot.

00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:57.270
Why?

00:23:57.270 --> 00:23:58.210
Why?

00:23:58.210 --> 00:24:00.200
OK We're going to change that.

00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:03.350
And we're changing that in
Cedar Park in our microcosm.

00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:05.200
Our school nurses will
log into the system.

00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:07.646
We will have our patient's
consent for that ahead of time.

00:24:07.646 --> 00:24:09.770
And they will have the
health information exchange,

00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:11.436
we'll give them the
information they do.

00:24:11.436 --> 00:24:12.270
And you know what?

00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:14.240
They won't bother my staff.

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:16.935
It takes a lot of time for
us to process that as well.

00:24:19.790 --> 00:24:20.950
Open APIs.

00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:21.970
Open API project.

00:24:21.970 --> 00:24:23.560
Everyone know what an API is?

00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:26.180
Could someone explain it to me?

00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:27.660
Never mind.

00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:29.150
This is a quiet crowd here.

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:37.240
We're going to harness the power
of a full open source platform.

00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:41.220
This whole room snafu got me
all turned upside down today.

00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:43.180
We're going to integrate
third party services.

00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:43.970
Let me give you an example.

00:24:43.970 --> 00:24:45.845
We have a partnership
with a company of Paris

00:24:45.845 --> 00:24:47.110
called Slow Control.

00:24:47.110 --> 00:24:49.270
They are about to
announce their Baby Gigl.

00:24:49.270 --> 00:24:51.320
I didn't name it.

00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:56.870
And the French spelled
it G-I-G-L. So Gigl.

00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:58.650
What it is is a sleeve.

00:24:58.650 --> 00:25:00.910
It's Bluetooth enabled
with an inclinometer

00:25:00.910 --> 00:25:02.510
and volumetric sensing.

00:25:02.510 --> 00:25:06.060
So who has a baby?

00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:07.730
You need to keep
track of feeding.

00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:09.610
Pour it in the bottle,
you measure it,

00:25:09.610 --> 00:25:12.652
you put it, write it down,
give the baby their feed,

00:25:12.652 --> 00:25:14.610
write down how much they
ate, how long it took.

00:25:14.610 --> 00:25:17.230
What this sleeve
does is it actually

00:25:17.230 --> 00:25:18.950
knows how much you
pour in the bottle.

00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:21.770
It senses the parent the
best angle to hold the bottle

00:25:21.770 --> 00:25:23.810
and it evolves as they feed.

00:25:23.810 --> 00:25:28.530
And also records volume,
lumps, air feeds, rate of feed,

00:25:28.530 --> 00:25:30.350
and presents it in
a graphical format.

00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:33.870
So when a patient brings their
newborn to me, I sit there

00:25:33.870 --> 00:25:36.200
and I say, OK, how's
the feeding going?

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:36.890
Good.

00:25:36.890 --> 00:25:39.360
All right, we're going to go
and take a look at him now.

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:43.320
Instead with our Baby
Gigl, all the feeding data

00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:45.570
that's been compiled
by the hardware

00:25:45.570 --> 00:25:47.900
will show on the date of
service and give the doctor

00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:51.380
not only volume, but
pattern, rates of feeding,

00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:55.680
caloric intake, and overall
calories per kilogram

00:25:55.680 --> 00:26:00.071
per day with no effort at all.

00:26:00.071 --> 00:26:02.320
And because we can stream
that data through our health

00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:04.470
information exchange
using our APIs,

00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:07.680
we can present that data
to the doctor in real time.

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:09.529
And the parents are
more engaged as well

00:26:09.529 --> 00:26:11.320
because they know
they're getting the data.

00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:13.940
So we're either doing with an
over-exhausted newborn parent

00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:16.100
who's like, it's going good.

00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:19.420
Or we're dealing with a
platform, a modified self

00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:21.490
platform, that gives
us the data securely,

00:26:21.490 --> 00:26:22.790
privately, and efficiently.

00:26:22.790 --> 00:26:24.329
And I think that
works out better.

00:26:24.329 --> 00:26:25.620
There was a question over here.

00:26:28.350 --> 00:26:29.666
Please.

00:26:29.666 --> 00:26:30.540
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:34.510 --> 00:26:35.305
JOSEPH COHEN: Yes.

00:26:35.305 --> 00:26:36.180
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:41.149 --> 00:26:42.690
JOSEPH COHEN: That's
a good question.

00:26:42.690 --> 00:26:46.510
And My co-founder is here and is
going to talk a little bit more

00:26:46.510 --> 00:26:48.120
about that in a few minutes.

00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:50.360
And I want to stick with
that question in a second.

00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:53.040
But what the answer
is, it does have

00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:56.480
to do with end user
authorizations as well.

00:26:56.480 --> 00:27:01.280
So your level of security
is my login to the platform,

00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:04.530
timing out, auto timing out so
that nobody else could walk up

00:27:04.530 --> 00:27:08.260
behind you and see it, logging
in on your device and whatnot.

00:27:08.260 --> 00:27:10.880
Also the fact is we don't
sync to our workstations,

00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:12.620
we expose to our workstations.

00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:14.320
But we'll have more on that.

00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:16.470
I didn't leave any
of that out, Ron?

00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:18.710
I left some out?

00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:21.040
I got it.

00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:25.200
My talk last year was titled,
I'm A Doctor, Not A Developer.

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:27.478
Yeah.

00:27:27.478 --> 00:27:29.186
Let's see some of
these things in action.

00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:35.250
Well, yeah, tears, I know.

00:27:35.250 --> 00:27:38.730
OK, let's talk about
camera support.

00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:42.170
These are two diagnostic images
I took with Google Glass.

00:27:42.170 --> 00:27:46.810
These are images that are
actually in patient charts.

00:27:46.810 --> 00:27:51.010
And patients who have
doctors that write or use

00:27:51.010 --> 00:27:53.750
most conventional
EMRs, this finding

00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:57.820
would be documented as, this
one on the here, this one

00:27:57.820 --> 00:28:01.080
is two flesh colored keratinized
papules with central puncta

00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:03.970
ichthyosis of one to two
millimeters on the extensor

00:28:03.970 --> 00:28:06.100
surface of the right elbow.

00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:09.100
How long does that
take this type?

00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:11.760
It takes about 45 seconds
to a minute for me.

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:15.060
Students maybe two to
three, five minutes.

00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:18.990
Instead I take the photo,
it shows up in the charts,

00:28:18.990 --> 00:28:21.730
and we move on.

00:28:21.730 --> 00:28:26.430
So I'll annotate here instead
voeller surface right elbow.

00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:27.500
And the other one.

00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:29.400
Large macules of
alopecia consisting

00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:31.917
of vellus hairs and exclamation
point hairs of 25 to 30

00:28:31.917 --> 00:28:33.750
millimeters on [INAUDIBLE]
without any signs

00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:34.375
of [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:36.970 --> 00:28:39.310
Or we can, say it with me.

00:28:39.310 --> 00:28:40.494
AUDIENCE: Take a picture.

00:28:40.494 --> 00:28:41.910
JOSEPH COHEN: As
a matter of fact,

00:28:41.910 --> 00:28:43.035
we're in for a treat today.

00:28:43.035 --> 00:28:46.740
I'm actually going to show you
our demonstration server, how

00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:48.630
that works.

00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:50.090
So these are mock patients.

00:28:50.090 --> 00:28:58.230
Let me hope that that's not--
is that the minimized one?

00:28:58.230 --> 00:29:00.520
Sweet.

00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:02.020
So in a patient's visit.

00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:04.228
We're going to actually use
just the device hardware,

00:29:04.228 --> 00:29:07.655
because this module requires
us to be on a secure network.

00:29:10.590 --> 00:29:12.813
We have an image assessment.

00:29:12.813 --> 00:29:13.313
Whoops.

00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:19.630
Oh, is it going to do that?

00:29:19.630 --> 00:29:20.370
There we go.

00:29:20.370 --> 00:29:23.869
So our image [? grabber. ?] You
can actually capture the photo.

00:29:23.869 --> 00:29:26.160
It's going to be a little
slow because the network here

00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:29.450
is so fast.

00:29:29.450 --> 00:29:30.630
So here we are.

00:29:30.630 --> 00:29:31.720
I'm capturing now.

00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:33.060
This camera can be anything.

00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:36.024
Could be your camera
for your cell phone.

00:29:36.024 --> 00:29:36.940
Could be Google Glass.

00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:39.980
It could be something
like the HTC RE camera.

00:29:39.980 --> 00:29:42.810
And we capture it.

00:29:42.810 --> 00:29:43.770
I look great, don't I?

00:29:43.770 --> 00:29:44.620
43 tomorrow.

00:29:47.389 --> 00:29:49.430
We capture it, it takes
forever because we're not

00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:50.950
on our network.

00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:52.890
It goes into the
date of service here.

00:29:52.890 --> 00:29:54.760
And I can annotate.

00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:58.250
Going to be 43.

00:29:58.250 --> 00:29:59.590
Save it.

00:29:59.590 --> 00:30:01.380
And now the
information's showing up

00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:02.489
on the date of service.

00:30:02.489 --> 00:30:04.280
And I'm going to show
you a little bit more

00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:06.821
on this, a few examples on how
that actually means something.

00:30:10.290 --> 00:30:11.590
So back to that.

00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:15.050
Let's take a look at
this boy right here.

00:30:15.050 --> 00:30:17.120
With the direct
camera support, we're

00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:18.990
preserving the visual diagnosis.

00:30:18.990 --> 00:30:22.010
Does this mean anything to
a parent of a sick child?

00:30:22.010 --> 00:30:23.055
Does it?

00:30:23.055 --> 00:30:26.170
It means a lot.

00:30:26.170 --> 00:30:27.910
We have a lot of teens here.

00:30:27.910 --> 00:30:32.200
Your acne, the doctor's writing,
not that any of you have it.

00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:38.038
Thank you, good night.

00:30:38.038 --> 00:30:40.480
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:42.860
STDs and [INAUDIBLE] acne.

00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:44.299
That's great.

00:30:44.299 --> 00:30:46.090
We'll be having another
talk at two o'clock

00:30:46.090 --> 00:30:47.881
where we're talking
about tech in medicine.

00:30:47.881 --> 00:30:51.650
I'm sure you guys are going
to love to-- kids in tech.

00:30:51.650 --> 00:30:56.410
Anyways, if the doctor wanted
to know how you improved,

00:30:56.410 --> 00:30:58.870
wouldn't it be better if you
had a picture of your skin

00:30:58.870 --> 00:30:59.970
to compare with?

00:30:59.970 --> 00:31:02.640
This is a very unfortunate
boy who had something

00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:04.490
with a really long name.

00:31:04.490 --> 00:31:08.930
And the top picture is when
he came to see me first.

00:31:08.930 --> 00:31:11.040
So then I did some of my magic.

00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:12.840
And you look at
the bottom picture

00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:15.370
and that was about
a day or two later.

00:31:15.370 --> 00:31:20.690
Is there any doubt in your mind
that this patient is improving?

00:31:20.690 --> 00:31:22.540
You all have
honorary doctorates.

00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:24.430
You just did it.

00:31:24.430 --> 00:31:25.380
You just did it.

00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:27.800
Is there any doubt
in the lawyer's mind

00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:32.710
of the parent later on that
says he didn't make them better?

00:31:32.710 --> 00:31:34.150
Is there any doubt?

00:31:34.150 --> 00:31:37.437
Because I'll tell you, you
know what the chart would say?

00:31:37.437 --> 00:31:39.520
It would say two flesh
colored keratinized papules

00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:41.160
with central puncta
ichthyosis of one

00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:42.576
to two millimeters
on the extensor

00:31:42.576 --> 00:31:44.915
surface of the right
elbow, dash improved.

00:31:48.610 --> 00:31:50.110
That's what they
train us to do, OK?

00:31:53.670 --> 00:31:55.280
That's our standard
of care, people.

00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:57.029
We're going to change
the standard of care

00:31:57.029 --> 00:31:58.179
and enforce it.

00:31:58.179 --> 00:31:59.220
It lowers your liability.

00:31:59.220 --> 00:32:00.516
It helps you gauge progress.

00:32:00.516 --> 00:32:01.765
It's meaningful documentation.

00:32:01.765 --> 00:32:04.980
It takes no time, it's secure,
it's safe, it's sufficient.

00:32:04.980 --> 00:32:08.590
It improves the health
and lives of my patients.

00:32:08.590 --> 00:32:10.340
My patients need that.

00:32:10.340 --> 00:32:13.780
Here's another example of how
we use our APIs through a HIPAA

00:32:13.780 --> 00:32:15.260
compliant Google
Calendar support.

00:32:15.260 --> 00:32:20.540
Yes, with my locked phone I can
have my HIPAA compliant patient

00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:25.150
calendar on my Google
Calendar with full compliance.

00:32:25.150 --> 00:32:28.320
Try to do that with one of
the large corporate products.

00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:30.580
Not going to happen.

00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:32.969
Shows the power
of our open APIs.

00:32:32.969 --> 00:32:34.010
Our Google Glass support.

00:32:34.010 --> 00:32:37.080
This is a wire frame that's
really small and blurry.

00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:41.130
But it shows how we can use
glassware, the wonderful mirror

00:32:41.130 --> 00:32:45.157
API SDK, whatever it's called.

00:32:45.157 --> 00:32:45.990
One of those things.

00:32:45.990 --> 00:32:47.060
Both.

00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:47.920
It's SDK.

00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:52.160
And we can use the hardware
to capture meaningful data

00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:53.580
for our patients.

00:32:53.580 --> 00:32:55.800
Any questions?

00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:56.990
Health information exchange.

00:32:56.990 --> 00:32:58.337
This is a generic-- yes?

00:32:58.337 --> 00:32:59.212
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:05.950 --> 00:33:09.490
JOSEPH COHEN: Oh, it needs work.

00:33:09.490 --> 00:33:12.740
That's why I'm
talking to you people.

00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:14.780
It needs work.

00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:15.780
I'm trying to find it.

00:33:15.780 --> 00:33:18.166
There it is.

00:33:18.166 --> 00:33:19.290
I used to wear Glass a lot.

00:33:19.290 --> 00:33:22.060
It's kind of getting
past my threshold.

00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:24.510
I can't wear something
three years old.

00:33:24.510 --> 00:33:27.290
But it's really slow,
it gets really hot.

00:33:27.290 --> 00:33:28.940
It's at work where I need it.

00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:31.980
But we need to see
improvements in the hardware.

00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:34.280
We need to see other
form factors that

00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:39.360
don't make you look like
someone on "Star Trek."

00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:42.420
Actually they look
better on "Star Trek."

00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:44.110
But oh, you just
filmed that, Google.

00:33:44.110 --> 00:33:45.270
That's from Google.

00:33:45.270 --> 00:33:46.536
I'm going to hell.

00:33:46.536 --> 00:33:48.470
There was a question back there.

00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:49.938
Yes?

00:33:49.938 --> 00:33:50.813
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:57.412 --> 00:33:58.120
JOSEPH COHEN: OK.

00:33:58.120 --> 00:34:00.350
That's a good question and
I may have not been clear.

00:34:00.350 --> 00:34:04.200
It's the doctor's responsibility
of taking the visual diagnosis

00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:07.450
and actually writing
what he thinks it is.

00:34:07.450 --> 00:34:10.170
In the medical data format,
I'd take the picture

00:34:10.170 --> 00:34:12.270
and in the assessment
section of the plan.

00:34:12.270 --> 00:34:14.170
So we have a child
with that rash.

00:34:14.170 --> 00:34:17.040
That first one is
actually just some warts.

00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:19.340
So I would actually
assess it as warts

00:34:19.340 --> 00:34:22.030
and write it in
my treatment plan.

00:34:22.030 --> 00:34:25.389
Unfortunately, we cannot make
technology legally in this

00:34:25.389 --> 00:34:27.230
country that acts like a doctor.

00:34:27.230 --> 00:34:30.090
We can only make technology
that assists a doctor.

00:34:30.090 --> 00:34:32.520
Otherwise you'd put
me out of a job.

00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:34.010
Health Information Exchange.

00:34:34.010 --> 00:34:38.810
The universal adapter for the
efficient streamlined transfer

00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:41.020
of HIPAA compliant data,
no matter what it is.

00:34:41.020 --> 00:34:42.520
It's all ones and zeros.

00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:44.750
Thank you.

00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:47.649
Am I sweating more now?

00:34:47.649 --> 00:34:50.215
Did I pee my pants?

00:34:50.215 --> 00:34:52.909
Oh, sorry.

00:34:52.909 --> 00:34:56.920
And it can be used for
any amount of data.

00:34:56.920 --> 00:34:59.230
We've laid the
infrastructure down.

00:34:59.230 --> 00:35:02.410
We've established the personal
data transfer protocols.

00:35:02.410 --> 00:35:04.910
And this is where all of
it gets really exciting.

00:35:04.910 --> 00:35:09.170
This is our patient
portal prototype.

00:35:09.170 --> 00:35:11.930
And what it allows you to do,
what it allows our patient

00:35:11.930 --> 00:35:18.880
to do, more importantly, is to
completely manage their child's

00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:21.440
record on their phone.

00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:23.190
This is an exposure framework.

00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:27.970
So basically they log in and
the data opens, very similar to,

00:35:27.970 --> 00:35:29.730
say it with me, Facebook.

00:35:29.730 --> 00:35:32.290
If you're not logged
in, what's there?

00:35:32.290 --> 00:35:35.170
Nothing except for the stuff
they put on there to track you.

00:35:35.170 --> 00:35:37.860
We're not doing that.

00:35:37.860 --> 00:35:41.540
This allows a parent to check
their upcoming appointments,

00:35:41.540 --> 00:35:44.270
reschedule set appointments.

00:35:44.270 --> 00:35:48.245
Allows you to read
messages from your doctor.

00:35:48.245 --> 00:35:57.787
It allows you to pay for any of
your services and co-payments.

00:35:57.787 --> 00:35:59.620
Also allows you to
refill your prescription.

00:35:59.620 --> 00:36:01.940
What did you used
to do before this?

00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:02.620
What did you do?

00:36:02.620 --> 00:36:06.090
You went in, you
stood in line for them

00:36:06.090 --> 00:36:08.130
to forget you and go
back four days later

00:36:08.130 --> 00:36:10.470
and go back and stand in line.

00:36:10.470 --> 00:36:12.320
No more.

00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:14.150
The other things
that patients can do

00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:15.710
is check out their
lab test results.

00:36:15.710 --> 00:36:19.460
This is a mock up, so
it's not very clear.

00:36:19.460 --> 00:36:23.170
Medication, allergies,
medication list.

00:36:23.170 --> 00:36:24.870
So let's go back to that.

00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:26.530
Let's go back to that example.

00:36:26.530 --> 00:36:30.450
Parents are out of town,
you didn't listen to them,

00:36:30.450 --> 00:36:33.335
and your friend ran over
your foot with their car.

00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:37.400
That's actually a true story.

00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:41.010
And you have an allergy to a
medicine they need to give you,

00:36:41.010 --> 00:36:43.160
but you have no idea what it is.

00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:48.050
You show them exactly
what it is here.

00:36:48.050 --> 00:36:50.220
It saves time, saves
lives, saves money.

00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:51.910
Yes, in the back.

00:36:51.910 --> 00:36:54.215
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:54.215 --> 00:36:55.590
JOSEPH COHEN:
Eventually it will.

00:36:55.590 --> 00:36:56.150
It doesn't.

00:36:56.150 --> 00:37:00.500
He asks if it has it access
to insurance information.

00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:03.970
It's not in the best interest of
large health care conglomerates

00:37:03.970 --> 00:37:06.640
to expose their data.

00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:08.957
So there's tons of
different systems.

00:37:08.957 --> 00:37:10.790
They're not all meeting
the same convention.

00:37:10.790 --> 00:37:12.712
But eventually they'll
see it our way.

00:37:12.712 --> 00:37:14.170
And if they don't,
then the patient

00:37:14.170 --> 00:37:16.544
can help advocate for
their own data transfer.

00:37:16.544 --> 00:37:18.710
A patient can do whatever
they want with their data.

00:37:18.710 --> 00:37:20.205
But that's a great
question and we

00:37:20.205 --> 00:37:22.580
are going to just have to
disrupt the industry until they

00:37:22.580 --> 00:37:23.410
see it our way.

00:37:23.410 --> 00:37:24.322
Yes?

00:37:24.322 --> 00:37:25.197
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:27.949 --> 00:37:29.490
JOSEPH COHEN: That's
a good question.

00:37:29.490 --> 00:37:32.210
And that has to do with the way
that the database is encrypted

00:37:32.210 --> 00:37:35.350
and also in our
hardware infrastructure.

00:37:35.350 --> 00:37:37.932
And we're going to get a little
bit more into that later.

00:37:37.932 --> 00:37:39.890
Most of the data breaches,
as a matter of fact,

00:37:39.890 --> 00:37:42.060
all the big high
profile data breaches

00:37:42.060 --> 00:37:43.712
that you've read in
the news, they all

00:37:43.712 --> 00:37:45.420
had their data stored
with no encryption.

00:37:48.070 --> 00:37:50.157
In Health was one.

00:37:50.157 --> 00:37:52.490
Someone just walked up to the
server with a thumb drive,

00:37:52.490 --> 00:37:55.750
stuck it in, took their data.

00:37:55.750 --> 00:37:56.957
So also reports, whatnot.

00:37:56.957 --> 00:37:58.415
Let's go back to
this presentation.

00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:03.650
It's exciting, isn't it?

00:38:03.650 --> 00:38:05.810
And it's going to save us time.

00:38:05.810 --> 00:38:09.660
So imagine a patient
has a picture

00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:13.220
from the rash from last night.

00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:16.224
They can actually take the
photo stored in the app

00:38:16.224 --> 00:38:17.890
and the doctor pulls
it out of the cloud

00:38:17.890 --> 00:38:18.820
and puts it in their chart.

00:38:18.820 --> 00:38:19.590
So the patient came in.

00:38:19.590 --> 00:38:21.150
This is what it looked
like last night.

00:38:21.150 --> 00:38:22.890
This is what it looks
like today in my office.

00:38:22.890 --> 00:38:24.806
And then tomorrow, this
is what it looks like.

00:38:24.806 --> 00:38:25.803
Yes, in the back.

00:38:25.803 --> 00:38:26.678
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:32.430 --> 00:38:34.130
JOSEPH COHEN: It's
completely personal.

00:38:34.130 --> 00:38:35.980
Nobody random will
able to see it.

00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:37.870
You need to
authenticate yourself.

00:38:37.870 --> 00:38:40.480
You also need to identify that
the doctor you're seeing with

00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:41.960
and authenticate them.

00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:43.234
And they would see it.

00:38:43.234 --> 00:38:44.900
A lot of people
worrying about security.

00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:45.920
That's good.

00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:47.720
So why Android?

00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:52.210
Well, Android, I see most of
the phones I see in my office

00:38:52.210 --> 00:38:53.090
are Android headsets.

00:38:53.090 --> 00:38:57.370
Cracked Android headsets,
because kids just are like, oh,

00:38:57.370 --> 00:38:57.870
great.

00:39:01.420 --> 00:39:03.130
It's like a splinter
waiting to happen.

00:39:03.130 --> 00:39:05.860
It's really good for business.

00:39:05.860 --> 00:39:09.090
But it's the most affordable
and generalizable platform,

00:39:09.090 --> 00:39:12.500
say it with me, at scale.

00:39:12.500 --> 00:39:13.280
Thank you.

00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:14.570
You said it a little after me.

00:39:14.570 --> 00:39:17.460
Let's work on that.

00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:24.250
And children are our number
one renewable resource.

00:39:24.250 --> 00:39:25.855
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:25.855 --> 00:39:26.355
What?

00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:33.795
They are.

00:39:33.795 --> 00:39:34.950
They are.

00:39:34.950 --> 00:39:35.450
What?

00:39:35.450 --> 00:39:38.380
OK, cellphones.

00:39:38.380 --> 00:39:41.360
Did I say something wrong?

00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:43.360
Special considerations
to health care.

00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:45.440
Affordability, accuracy.

00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:47.440
We don't want to
[? portray ?] our information

00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:48.510
with less accuracy.

00:39:48.510 --> 00:39:49.970
Privacy we've talked about.

00:39:49.970 --> 00:39:52.100
And also one thing that
we don't always talk about

00:39:52.100 --> 00:39:54.510
is accessibility.

00:39:54.510 --> 00:39:57.020
You may not see a lot of
children in wheelchairs

00:39:57.020 --> 00:39:59.506
at the mall, but you
see a lot of children

00:39:59.506 --> 00:40:00.755
with wheelchairs in my office.

00:40:00.755 --> 00:40:02.250
What does that tell you?

00:40:02.250 --> 00:40:05.650
That your audience is more
likely to be a specialty

00:40:05.650 --> 00:40:06.460
audience.

00:40:06.460 --> 00:40:09.570
And you better bake in some
accessibility for them.

00:40:09.570 --> 00:40:12.290
Because they're just as entitled
to this revolution as we are.

00:40:15.540 --> 00:40:18.210
So keep calm and follow
the prime directive.

00:40:18.210 --> 00:40:21.160
HIPAA, Healthcare Insurance
Portability and Accountability

00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:25.216
Act, which really has nothing
to do with portability at all,

00:40:25.216 --> 00:40:28.880
is all about keeping data
private, keeping it protected.

00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:33.180
It's the prime directive
of health care information.

00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:34.640
And we're going to keep going.

00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:37.740
So oops.

00:40:37.740 --> 00:40:39.830
I'm going to do so I
co-founder, Ron Criswell.

00:40:39.830 --> 00:40:41.847
He's the tech guy.

00:40:41.847 --> 00:40:44.180
And he's going to take a few
minutes to talk to you guys

00:40:44.180 --> 00:40:48.270
about how we've established our
HIPAA compliant architecture.

00:40:48.270 --> 00:40:49.290
Please welcome Ron.

00:40:49.290 --> 00:40:49.939
Ron Criswell.

00:40:49.939 --> 00:40:51.980
RON CRISWELL: Try to answer
some of the questions

00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:54.910
that people brought up about
how we have implemented

00:40:54.910 --> 00:40:58.030
a lot of these
tasks and how we're

00:40:58.030 --> 00:41:02.660
going about making the software
and the data accessible

00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:06.820
and still maintaining security
and protection of that data.

00:41:06.820 --> 00:41:09.140
We have kind of two
goals that seem to be

00:41:09.140 --> 00:41:10.550
opposite ends of the spectrum.

00:41:10.550 --> 00:41:14.380
We want to make a fairly
open, easy to use,

00:41:14.380 --> 00:41:18.660
fairly simple
platform and API that

00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:21.620
encourages development and
encourages people to use it.

00:41:21.620 --> 00:41:23.320
At the same time,
we need to make sure

00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:26.920
that we adhere to all of
the HIPAA requirements,

00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:28.500
that we maintain
security, that we

00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:30.570
maintain privacy in that data.

00:41:30.570 --> 00:41:32.950
The way we've gone about
doing that is we use fairly

00:41:32.950 --> 00:41:38.520
standard technology, browser
based technology and supported

00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:45.490
HTTP protocols in a method that
is compatible with application

00:41:45.490 --> 00:41:50.270
development on either a portable
platform with an Android type

00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:55.530
application or with HTML
inside a browser like Chrome

00:41:55.530 --> 00:41:57.450
or Firefox or
something like that.

00:41:57.450 --> 00:42:00.510
Essentially what we do is
you have to authenticate.

00:42:00.510 --> 00:42:03.140
Your authentication
mechanism from the API

00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:06.230
is OAuth 2, which is a very
familiar, very standardized

00:42:06.230 --> 00:42:09.070
mechanism that Google uses in
a lot of their applications.

00:42:09.070 --> 00:42:11.210
What OAuth 2 does
is it allows us

00:42:11.210 --> 00:42:13.970
to validate who the
device is or who

00:42:13.970 --> 00:42:18.830
the software is trying to talk
to us as a primary connection

00:42:18.830 --> 00:42:19.730
security.

00:42:19.730 --> 00:42:23.150
And secondly, it
allows us to verify

00:42:23.150 --> 00:42:25.830
that you have access
to the specific account

00:42:25.830 --> 00:42:27.990
that you want to have access to.

00:42:27.990 --> 00:42:29.640
Somebody was asking
earlier about

00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:31.280
how you make sure
that you're only

00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:33.030
talking to this one person.

00:42:33.030 --> 00:42:37.050
That's the way we do it, is we
provide the OAuth 2 security

00:42:37.050 --> 00:42:40.940
algorithms that allow an
application to connect to us.

00:42:40.940 --> 00:42:42.850
And if you provide the
correct credentials,

00:42:42.850 --> 00:42:44.680
then we'll allow
you to access it.

00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:46.800
It's the exact same
kind of technologies

00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:49.800
that the banks use for signing
on to your online banking

00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:50.610
accounts.

00:42:50.610 --> 00:42:56.090
Very tried and trued
application, very secure use

00:42:56.090 --> 00:42:59.782
of the whole algorithm
and schema process

00:42:59.782 --> 00:43:01.490
to be able to do that
kind of connection.

00:43:01.490 --> 00:43:06.500
So that's one part of
our connection process.

00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:09.880
The second part is we're
using an SSL connection.

00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:11.620
End to end communication.

00:43:11.620 --> 00:43:15.370
We never provide a mechanism
for storing the data

00:43:15.370 --> 00:43:16.530
on the end point.

00:43:16.530 --> 00:43:18.230
You don't stored it
in the phone app,

00:43:18.230 --> 00:43:19.730
you don't store it
on your computer,

00:43:19.730 --> 00:43:21.600
you don't store
it in the browser.

00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:24.340
It's always a pull the
data, display it, and then

00:43:24.340 --> 00:43:25.820
throw it away.

00:43:25.820 --> 00:43:29.410
That's necessary to make sure
that you don't have problems

00:43:29.410 --> 00:43:34.610
with storing unencrypted
data anywhere in the set up.

00:43:34.610 --> 00:43:35.438
Yes?

00:43:35.438 --> 00:43:37.070
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:37.070 --> 00:43:39.830
RON CRISWELL: We're not doing a
two factor authentication right

00:43:39.830 --> 00:43:40.330
now.

00:43:40.330 --> 00:43:42.110
We could do it.

00:43:42.110 --> 00:43:43.770
And we're kind of
looking at that

00:43:43.770 --> 00:43:46.762
as an alternative for
future mechanisms.

00:43:46.762 --> 00:43:48.470
Like I say, right now
what we're doing is

00:43:48.470 --> 00:43:50.761
we're checking to make sure
that the application that's

00:43:50.761 --> 00:43:53.130
trying to talk to us
is our application

00:43:53.130 --> 00:43:54.650
or it's an approved application.

00:43:54.650 --> 00:43:56.740
So the application has
a set of credentials

00:43:56.740 --> 00:43:58.910
to authenticate itself,
And then there's

00:43:58.910 --> 00:44:01.310
a secondary level for
the authentication

00:44:01.310 --> 00:44:03.910
of the individual records
that they're trying to access.

00:44:03.910 --> 00:44:06.812
That's as far as we've
gone with it right now.

00:44:06.812 --> 00:44:07.687
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:30.170 --> 00:44:34.389
RON CRISWELL: Not at this
point, but that's a good point.

00:44:34.389 --> 00:44:35.930
And that's something
that we may need

00:44:35.930 --> 00:44:37.920
to go through and
do something more

00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:44.200
along the process of having
an identifiable figure

00:44:44.200 --> 00:44:46.080
that a lot of the
banking applications use,

00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:47.800
and some of those
types of things.

00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:50.680
These are the types
of areas that we're

00:44:50.680 --> 00:44:53.520
needing participation,
we're needing input.

00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:55.630
We don't pretend to
have all the answers.

00:44:55.630 --> 00:44:57.940
I'm kind of giving you
where we're at right now.

00:44:57.940 --> 00:45:00.120
But we definitely have
room for improvement.

00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:01.842
We need input from
the communities.

00:45:01.842 --> 00:45:04.050
We need to know what types
of things are recommended.

00:45:04.050 --> 00:45:05.299
That's what we're looking for.

00:45:05.299 --> 00:45:08.680
That's what we're hoping to
get from our partnerships

00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:11.900
with developers are, what
are the areas that we

00:45:11.900 --> 00:45:13.120
need to improve on?

00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:17.330
As far as the data, we keep
all of the data encrypted

00:45:17.330 --> 00:45:21.740
on fully encrypted databases so
that there's no chance of being

00:45:21.740 --> 00:45:25.350
able to access it brute force.

00:45:25.350 --> 00:45:27.530
But there is, when
you're transmitting data,

00:45:27.530 --> 00:45:29.355
you do have that vulnerability.

00:45:29.355 --> 00:45:30.730
You need to make
sure that you've

00:45:30.730 --> 00:45:32.950
got the correct connections.

00:45:32.950 --> 00:45:35.930
And somebody else
had a question?

00:45:35.930 --> 00:45:37.974
So anyway, we're
starting to more people

00:45:37.974 --> 00:45:39.390
in, so I'm sure
that we're getting

00:45:39.390 --> 00:45:42.150
close to the next
presentation [? side. ?]

00:45:42.150 --> 00:45:43.780
But really what
we're doing-- oh,

00:45:43.780 --> 00:45:46.760
the other piece for
external access,

00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:49.000
the API access, what
we're working with

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:51.730
is standard RESTful APIs.

00:45:51.730 --> 00:45:54.090
The data connections
are designed

00:45:54.090 --> 00:45:55.830
to be able to provide access.

00:45:55.830 --> 00:45:59.150
What we're looking for in
help in the development arena

00:45:59.150 --> 00:46:03.270
is for people to come up
with new and interesting ways

00:46:03.270 --> 00:46:05.270
of processing that data
and making that data

00:46:05.270 --> 00:46:10.680
available to other applications
and in ways that help improve

00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:13.420
the quality of the health
care, help improve the outcomes

00:46:13.420 --> 00:46:14.200
and so forth.

00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:16.900
We're providing the
tools into the data.

00:46:16.900 --> 00:46:18.720
What we're looking
for is help coming up

00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:22.430
with better, new methods
of presenting the data,

00:46:22.430 --> 00:46:25.230
massaging the data, and
making the data useful,

00:46:25.230 --> 00:46:27.790
turning it into information
for the end users.

00:46:33.647 --> 00:46:34.730
JOSEPH COHEN: Thanks, Ron.

00:46:34.730 --> 00:46:36.390
Thank you.

00:46:36.390 --> 00:46:38.460
That clear it up a little bit?

00:46:38.460 --> 00:46:40.110
A couple of things right now.

00:46:40.110 --> 00:46:43.570
We do have stopgap
measures for two factor.

00:46:43.570 --> 00:46:45.200
Any of our cloud
based access, you

00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:47.610
need to authenticate through
VPN before you access it.

00:46:47.610 --> 00:46:51.240
And then our actual native
site of practice, you actually

00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:53.420
would have to have the
credentials for the network

00:46:53.420 --> 00:46:54.640
as well.

00:46:54.640 --> 00:47:00.180
So we're very well aware
of-- excuse me one second.

00:47:00.180 --> 00:47:02.180
We're very well aware of
the need for two factor

00:47:02.180 --> 00:47:02.810
authentication.

00:47:02.810 --> 00:47:04.820
I think that it's
very important.

00:47:04.820 --> 00:47:07.380
We have other ways of
solving it using two factor

00:47:07.380 --> 00:47:10.907
and putting our login
wall behind maybe Google

00:47:10.907 --> 00:47:12.490
App for Business,
Google Apps for work

00:47:12.490 --> 00:47:14.906
where you're actually being
enforced two factor that way.

00:47:14.906 --> 00:47:16.780
But one of the things
that we've been looking

00:47:16.780 --> 00:47:19.500
at with the mobile
technology, how does

00:47:19.500 --> 00:47:22.170
the patient link to the doctor?

00:47:22.170 --> 00:47:25.260
I feel that we use kind
of like a Bitcoin model

00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:28.270
where you scan a
code or you enter

00:47:28.270 --> 00:47:30.730
a code that's unique
to that physician

00:47:30.730 --> 00:47:35.080
that you can only get there at
that office that connects you

00:47:35.080 --> 00:47:38.510
through the application to
your chart and your provider.

00:47:38.510 --> 00:47:40.490
But these are
excellent questions

00:47:40.490 --> 00:47:43.370
and exactly why we're here.

00:47:43.370 --> 00:47:44.950
Because we need your help.

00:47:44.950 --> 00:47:48.370
We need your help
to take our platform

00:47:48.370 --> 00:47:50.390
and present it to our
patients and hopefully

00:47:50.390 --> 00:47:53.670
your patients that you know
and people they know as well.

00:47:53.670 --> 00:47:54.750
And this is the process.

00:47:54.750 --> 00:47:56.958
Basically you're going to
come to us with a discovery

00:47:56.958 --> 00:47:58.250
or proposal.

00:47:58.250 --> 00:48:02.200
You'll present your ideas to the
develop core or to us directly.

00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:05.000
We'll then go and vet it
with medical and ethical

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:08.190
advisory board that we already
have in London and here

00:48:08.190 --> 00:48:10.820
in Austin, here in Texas.

00:48:10.820 --> 00:48:13.750
We'll actually analyze its
practicality, the ethics,

00:48:13.750 --> 00:48:17.970
and if it is indeed
apps with impact.

00:48:17.970 --> 00:48:20.980
Then we'll go through prototype
and testing, and analysis

00:48:20.980 --> 00:48:22.980
for HIPAA compliance
and usability.

00:48:22.980 --> 00:48:26.180
And finally, release of an MVP
with reiteration and update

00:48:26.180 --> 00:48:29.010
process.

00:48:29.010 --> 00:48:30.290
It's time, guys.

00:48:30.290 --> 00:48:32.990
We can innovate, disrupt,
save money, save lives,

00:48:32.990 --> 00:48:34.070
make apps with impact.

00:48:34.070 --> 00:48:36.690
Actually this right here
is the London store,

00:48:36.690 --> 00:48:38.610
the Google store in London.

00:48:38.610 --> 00:48:43.250
If you ever there it's on Warren
Street in Tottenham Court Road.

00:48:43.250 --> 00:48:44.330
It's a lot of fun.

00:48:44.330 --> 00:48:46.610
They have a little
spray painter.

00:48:46.610 --> 00:48:48.650
It's a digital
spray paint bottle

00:48:48.650 --> 00:48:51.120
that you can actually pick
your color and spray paint.

00:48:51.120 --> 00:48:54.304
And course in true Google
form, when you shake it,

00:48:54.304 --> 00:48:56.720
it makes the sound like little
balls running around in it.

00:48:56.720 --> 00:48:59.040
It's pretty neat.

00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:01.290
I go there every time I
go, and more than once.

00:49:01.290 --> 00:49:03.610
So if you're interested
in working with us,

00:49:03.610 --> 00:49:05.910
this QR code will take you
to the devoted to the dev

00:49:05.910 --> 00:49:06.970
corp page.

00:49:06.970 --> 00:49:11.580
And you can also
search it on Google+.

00:49:11.580 --> 00:49:12.250
Please join.

00:49:12.250 --> 00:49:15.300
It's a private community
because we just want devs.

00:49:15.300 --> 00:49:17.279
Devs and kids.

00:49:17.279 --> 00:49:18.570
And people that are interested.

00:49:18.570 --> 00:49:20.640
We just don't need trolls
and people that are not

00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:22.990
relevant to the project.

00:49:22.990 --> 00:49:25.240
This is not a bridge in Denmark.

00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:27.550
You can also hit
me up at my email,

00:49:27.550 --> 00:49:31.510
on Twitter @ikeysee or at
kiddoemr and then +joeycohenMD

00:49:31.510 --> 00:49:35.140
or +iamdrjoekiddoemr, because
that makes a lot of sense.

00:49:35.140 --> 00:49:37.745
And I'd like to see if anyone
else has any questions.

00:49:40.952 --> 00:49:43.032
Did we answer them all already?

00:49:43.032 --> 00:49:44.365
OK, I have one more Seattle pin.

00:49:44.365 --> 00:49:45.920
Does anyone have a question now?

00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:47.183
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:48.450 --> 00:49:50.202
Yes, he has a question.

00:49:50.202 --> 00:49:51.077
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:50:03.025 --> 00:50:05.150
JOSEPH COHEN: I'm going to
reiterate your question.

00:50:05.150 --> 00:50:05.816
It's a good one.

00:50:05.816 --> 00:50:08.380
What he asked was, there's a
lot of EMR systems out there.

00:50:08.380 --> 00:50:12.100
Is there a common framework
for transferring information?

00:50:12.100 --> 00:50:14.210
Because the default
right now is fax.

00:50:14.210 --> 00:50:18.740
And yes, I do, I have a
fax machine in my office.

00:50:18.740 --> 00:50:22.720
My name is Dr. Joe and
I'm stuck on fax machines.

00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:24.250
It's disgusting, isn't it?

00:50:24.250 --> 00:50:25.670
Absolutely.

00:50:25.670 --> 00:50:26.300
And there are.

00:50:26.300 --> 00:50:29.750
There's the CDA, Clinical
Data Architecture, protocol,

00:50:29.750 --> 00:50:32.000
HL7, Health Level 7.

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:33.570
These are open
source standards that

00:50:33.570 --> 00:50:37.250
are prepared to [? handle ?]
the transfer of data.

00:50:37.250 --> 00:50:41.140
kiddoEMR, we just finished
our C-CDA architecture import

00:50:41.140 --> 00:50:41.640
export.

00:50:41.640 --> 00:50:44.950
We can actually take
information from anybody's EMR

00:50:44.950 --> 00:50:47.340
and incorporate it
into our platform.

00:50:47.340 --> 00:50:49.470
Unfortunately, most
EMRs don't want

00:50:49.470 --> 00:50:54.830
you to do that, which in my mind
is corporate greed interfering

00:50:54.830 --> 00:50:56.920
with the health and
well being of children

00:50:56.920 --> 00:50:59.530
in this country and others.

00:50:59.530 --> 00:51:02.360
And so we're using
open protocols

00:51:02.360 --> 00:51:06.210
to help facilitate that
data transfer as well.

00:51:06.210 --> 00:51:08.770
Here.

00:51:08.770 --> 00:51:11.420
I know.

00:51:11.420 --> 00:51:14.030
We can edit that out, right?

00:51:14.030 --> 00:51:15.083
Yes?

00:51:15.083 --> 00:51:15.958
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:51:20.924 --> 00:51:22.090
JOSEPH COHEN: Good question.

00:51:22.090 --> 00:51:22.812
FDA approval.

00:51:22.812 --> 00:51:24.270
What is the threshold
for something

00:51:24.270 --> 00:51:25.325
to become FDA approved?

00:51:27.840 --> 00:51:30.340
Yes.

00:51:30.340 --> 00:51:32.091
I talked a little bit
about this last year

00:51:32.091 --> 00:51:33.465
and I'm glad you
brought that up,

00:51:33.465 --> 00:51:36.030
because I'm realizing I had a
few holes in my presentation.

00:51:36.030 --> 00:51:36.820
I'll get to you.

00:51:36.820 --> 00:51:37.945
You can put your hand down.

00:51:40.850 --> 00:51:43.690
When you go see your doctor
and he's not using an EMR,

00:51:43.690 --> 00:51:45.295
he's using a what?

00:51:45.295 --> 00:51:47.280
Pen and paper.

00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:50.257
Is a pen and paper FDA approved?

00:51:50.257 --> 00:51:51.590
OK, let's say he's using an EMR.

00:51:51.590 --> 00:51:54.070
Is his MacBook FDA approved?

00:51:54.070 --> 00:51:56.760
Is his EMR FDA approved?

00:51:56.760 --> 00:51:57.880
No.

00:51:57.880 --> 00:52:01.730
But if he builds a
machine that tested

00:52:01.730 --> 00:52:07.540
blood sugar, an actual medical
intervention, and that affected

00:52:07.540 --> 00:52:09.070
the treatment of
that patient, he

00:52:09.070 --> 00:52:11.120
would have to have
that FDA approved.

00:52:11.120 --> 00:52:13.720
There was an app that
was a diabetic app that

00:52:13.720 --> 00:52:17.600
was built that was proved
to lower blood sugars better

00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:19.690
than Metformin, a drug.

00:52:19.690 --> 00:52:21.620
Well, that had to
be FDA approved.

00:52:21.620 --> 00:52:23.790
And it was actually
nothing in the app

00:52:23.790 --> 00:52:26.670
that was actually a medicine.

00:52:26.670 --> 00:52:28.471
It was just dietary
modification app.

00:52:28.471 --> 00:52:30.220
And that needed to go
through FDA approval

00:52:30.220 --> 00:52:31.430
because it was
actually implementing

00:52:31.430 --> 00:52:32.660
a care plan for the patient.

00:52:32.660 --> 00:52:34.387
Yes, you want to follow up?

00:52:34.387 --> 00:52:35.262
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:54.362 --> 00:52:55.820
JOSEPH COHEN: If
you were building,

00:52:55.820 --> 00:52:58.760
you would need to go through
the reliability of the device

00:52:58.760 --> 00:53:01.364
to actually tell you
what is actual the truth.

00:53:01.364 --> 00:53:03.030
And that would require
the FDA approval.

00:53:03.030 --> 00:53:06.080
But let's say you were building
a Chromecast for an app

00:53:06.080 --> 00:53:07.500
where you can project.

00:53:07.500 --> 00:53:09.530
And that probably
wouldn't need to be.

00:53:09.530 --> 00:53:11.430
I'm sure that there's
gray areas in this.

00:53:11.430 --> 00:53:12.638
And this is a great question.

00:53:12.638 --> 00:53:14.830
I'd like to talk to you
more afterwards about that.

00:53:14.830 --> 00:53:17.030
And really what he's asking
is, where's the line?

00:53:17.030 --> 00:53:21.500
In other words, where does
the line between FDA approval

00:53:21.500 --> 00:53:23.902
and not needing FDA approval,
where's that line drawn?

00:53:23.902 --> 00:53:26.110
And right now it's drawn
through medical intervention

00:53:26.110 --> 00:53:30.070
and evaluation and management
tools and treatments

00:53:30.070 --> 00:53:31.260
and therapies.

00:53:31.260 --> 00:53:35.360
Does it mean that we can't do
a handshake, a data handshake?

00:53:35.360 --> 00:53:36.030
I'm not sure.

00:53:36.030 --> 00:53:37.610
That's a good question.

00:53:37.610 --> 00:53:39.280
Who else?

00:53:39.280 --> 00:53:39.895
Yes.

00:53:39.895 --> 00:53:40.770
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:51.169 --> 00:53:52.960
JOSEPH COHEN: I'm sorry,
I didn't hear you.

00:53:52.960 --> 00:53:54.870
Can you stand up
and say it louder?

00:53:54.870 --> 00:53:55.745
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:54:07.447 --> 00:54:09.030
JOSEPH COHEN: That's
tough over there.

00:54:11.780 --> 00:54:13.300
I didn't think about that.

00:54:16.630 --> 00:54:17.240
Go on welfare?

00:54:24.180 --> 00:54:25.690
A lot of my family,
when they see

00:54:25.690 --> 00:54:28.065
on LinkedIn being CMO of this
and doing that, they're all

00:54:28.065 --> 00:54:29.080
like, congratulations.

00:54:29.080 --> 00:54:31.340
We knew you'd be successful.

00:54:31.340 --> 00:54:33.210
I've been running a
practice 15 years.

00:54:33.210 --> 00:54:34.550
That's my success.

00:54:34.550 --> 00:54:40.360
And if we were to go massive
electromagnetic pulse tomorrow

00:54:40.360 --> 00:54:42.660
and every computer
was died and fried,

00:54:42.660 --> 00:54:45.029
I'd just go back and
see my patients again.

00:54:45.029 --> 00:54:46.570
But as far as you
guys are concerned,

00:54:46.570 --> 00:54:49.220
what we're trying to do
is build an ecosystem.

00:54:49.220 --> 00:54:52.520
We're trying to build a standard
for the care of patients.

00:54:52.520 --> 00:54:55.130
And the cloud and
the architecture

00:54:55.130 --> 00:54:58.390
is there to satisfy
the patient's needs

00:54:58.390 --> 00:55:01.460
long after I'm in the ground.

00:55:01.460 --> 00:55:03.717
There's a famous quote.

00:55:03.717 --> 00:55:05.550
If you meet your goals
or you set your goals

00:55:05.550 --> 00:55:07.450
we met by the end
of your lifetime,

00:55:07.450 --> 00:55:09.660
you aren't thinking big enough.

00:55:09.660 --> 00:55:13.080
And really what I'm trying
to do here is just the start.

00:55:13.080 --> 00:55:13.750
So that's good.

00:55:13.750 --> 00:55:16.970
And hopefully with great minds
like you all contributing,

00:55:16.970 --> 00:55:19.380
we won't have to
worry about failure.

00:55:19.380 --> 00:55:20.854
Yes, in back.

00:55:20.854 --> 00:55:21.729
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:55:58.220 --> 00:55:59.460
JOSEPH COHEN: It doesn't.

00:55:59.460 --> 00:56:01.510
But it does.

00:56:01.510 --> 00:56:03.380
OK, that's a bit weird.

00:56:03.380 --> 00:56:04.620
It does.

00:56:04.620 --> 00:56:06.120
That's our plan.

00:56:06.120 --> 00:56:06.950
The data exists.

00:56:06.950 --> 00:56:11.720
We have a very robust tenured
historical granular data.

00:56:11.720 --> 00:56:14.300
But that is exactly
what we're trying to do.

00:56:14.300 --> 00:56:17.730
I could show you one
thing, if you want.

00:56:22.120 --> 00:56:25.070
I did a heat map.

00:56:25.070 --> 00:56:27.240
This I did about
a year ago myself.

00:56:27.240 --> 00:56:28.600
And I did a heat map.

00:56:28.600 --> 00:56:30.060
I use a weather
mapping algorithm.

00:56:30.060 --> 00:56:36.430
And I took my data from--
can you guys see that?

00:56:36.430 --> 00:56:40.480
I took my data from two
winters in Austin, Texas.

00:56:40.480 --> 00:56:45.690
I took patient location
and time and severity

00:56:45.690 --> 00:56:48.590
of allergies in January
and February in Austin.

00:56:48.590 --> 00:56:50.260
That means you're
allergic to cedar.

00:56:50.260 --> 00:56:54.020
And I took severity,
location, and time.

00:56:54.020 --> 00:56:56.670
And this is what came out
for the months of December

00:56:56.670 --> 00:57:00.150
and January of 2013 and 2014.

00:57:00.150 --> 00:57:03.700
If you see here, the red is
the most severe cedar fever

00:57:03.700 --> 00:57:06.410
allergies, and green
and yellow are less.

00:57:06.410 --> 00:57:11.020
What this actually showed us
is this green belt right here

00:57:11.020 --> 00:57:13.991
was pollinating all
of Lago Vista, Texas.

00:57:13.991 --> 00:57:15.490
And the mayor of
Lago Vista actually

00:57:15.490 --> 00:57:17.230
was very interested
in this analytic

00:57:17.230 --> 00:57:19.370
and we actually got
some press off of it.

00:57:19.370 --> 00:57:21.280
But that's what
we're talking about.

00:57:21.280 --> 00:57:23.070
Robust data manipulation.

00:57:23.070 --> 00:57:25.800
Presentation in ways
that actually matter.

00:57:25.800 --> 00:57:28.810
Now, I'm a human
who has a day job,

00:57:28.810 --> 00:57:31.170
and this took me
about two weeks.

00:57:31.170 --> 00:57:33.080
But with the proper
architecture,

00:57:33.080 --> 00:57:35.200
the proper programming,
the proper brilliance,

00:57:35.200 --> 00:57:39.480
we're working to have this
done autonomously, credibly,

00:57:39.480 --> 00:57:40.549
and in real time.

00:57:40.549 --> 00:57:41.840
So I really like your thinking.

00:57:41.840 --> 00:57:43.850
You definitely need
one of my cards.

00:57:43.850 --> 00:57:45.230
Yes?

00:57:45.230 --> 00:57:46.484
Yes?

00:57:46.484 --> 00:57:47.359
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:57:51.942 --> 00:57:53.400
JOSEPH COHEN: She's
asking, is this

00:57:53.400 --> 00:57:55.690
going the requirement for
all doctors in health care

00:57:55.690 --> 00:57:56.770
professions to use it?

00:57:56.770 --> 00:57:58.550
No.

00:57:58.550 --> 00:58:00.620
In England, the
National Health Service

00:58:00.620 --> 00:58:03.230
has tried to make something
a requirement for doctors

00:58:03.230 --> 00:58:04.330
in England in 2012.

00:58:04.330 --> 00:58:06.367
They spent $15
billion on a solution

00:58:06.367 --> 00:58:08.200
and had to mothball it
because doctors don't

00:58:08.200 --> 00:58:10.940
like being told what to do.

00:58:10.940 --> 00:58:11.500
Go figure.

00:58:11.500 --> 00:58:14.710
We tell you what to do all time.

00:58:14.710 --> 00:58:18.980
And our solution is bottoms up.

00:58:18.980 --> 00:58:20.810
Already the cost
savings is making it

00:58:20.810 --> 00:58:23.500
pretty undeniable argument.

00:58:23.500 --> 00:58:26.299
But why do people use Facebook?

00:58:26.299 --> 00:58:28.090
Because they want to
have that convenience.

00:58:28.090 --> 00:58:30.340
They want to know where their
high school friends are.

00:58:30.340 --> 00:58:31.940
They want to be able
to share pictures

00:58:31.940 --> 00:58:33.300
from when they were kids.

00:58:33.300 --> 00:58:34.530
They want to use it.

00:58:34.530 --> 00:58:36.470
Doctors want to use this.

00:58:36.470 --> 00:58:38.420
It's just we need
to get it to them.

00:58:38.420 --> 00:58:40.610
And it's going to
take some time.

00:58:40.610 --> 00:58:41.170
Who else?

00:58:43.720 --> 00:58:45.290
Am I missing anybody?

00:58:45.290 --> 00:58:47.360
All right, well thank
you very much for coming.

00:58:47.360 --> 00:58:50.625
I want to thank everybody
for paying attention.

00:58:50.625 --> 00:58:52.610
[APPLAUSE]

00:58:52.610 --> 00:58:54.180
I'll be here all week.

00:58:54.180 --> 00:58:58.870
We have at two o'clock a
kids and technology fireside

00:58:58.870 --> 00:58:59.980
chat in room six.

00:58:59.980 --> 00:59:02.330
And also the big barbecue's
coming up tonight.

00:59:02.330 --> 00:59:04.950
I don't know if you
guys have had Ray's.

00:59:04.950 --> 00:59:06.750
It's amazing stuff.

00:59:06.750 --> 00:59:08.310
So thanks for coming.

00:59:08.310 --> 00:59:11.360
