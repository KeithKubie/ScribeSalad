1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,540
The Joe Rogan experience.

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:05,330
It seems like a lot of people
would want to listen to you though.

3
00:00:05,331 --> 00:00:10,331
I would imagine if I was in camp with
a guy like you and I saw the kind of

4
00:00:10,401 --> 00:00:13,640
cardio that you have for a big guy and
the amount of effort that you put in.

5
00:00:13,641 --> 00:00:15,980
I would imagine there's other
dudes that are following you now.

6
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:19,880
No, I my teammates. Yeah. They know
like I'm one of the guys, my bike,

7
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:22,560
a brother to me, his car over sin.
You're saying he stepped down,

8
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,150
he stepped up on the glorified.

9
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:25,740
That's something we talked
about when he was an amateur.

10
00:00:25,741 --> 00:00:29,220
I've been working with amateur and I told
his coach stand like this kid is good.

11
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:31,200
He's correct stuff.
He'd go pro.

12
00:00:31,201 --> 00:00:34,530
He'd been UFC in no time telling
you cause he was, I watched him, me,

13
00:00:34,531 --> 00:00:35,490
him and Chris Weidman.

14
00:00:35,491 --> 00:00:38,430
He came in with us when I was hoping
why more the Rocco fight and I've,

15
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:42,040
I'm not sure if he was an amateur or pro
yet, but he was hanging his, you just,

16
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:44,780
you and her hustling. He didn't
have that, but striking wise,

17
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:48,090
he was giving us problems. It was like,
this is, this kid is good. He's like, oh,

18
00:00:48,091 --> 00:00:52,380
he's a glory kickboxing. Ah, that
makes sense. He kicks hard like,

19
00:00:52,381 --> 00:00:56,040
I haven't seen them put many people were
asleep with his head kicked in practice

20
00:00:56,041 --> 00:00:58,680
like Yo pull. He's like, Bro, that
wasn't your heart. Like what'd you mean?

21
00:00:58,681 --> 00:01:00,540
It wasn't high.
Like I just flicked it up there,

22
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:04,140
but he's just so explosive and
athletic. He hit me with a knee. What?

23
00:01:04,141 --> 00:01:05,700
Last Saturday my chest still hurt.

24
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:10,020
It was like I shot and he caught me coming
down and shot and I was like, Oh shit.

25
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:15,210
But I was in deep, but he just so
quick. It's just, but like he's one,

26
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:17,580
he hits me up all the time.
When you come to camp like, oh,

27
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:21,310
he has died down because of
Bo and Clint out of the pie,

28
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:24,810
but to come like the work and
stuff. Should we keep doing
this? Should we do this?

29
00:01:24,811 --> 00:01:27,510
I'm going to run today,
so when I want to work on my Jujitsu,

30
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:30,000
what should I do this? Should I just
drill? Should we go hard? Should I go?

31
00:01:30,001 --> 00:01:32,460
Who trained? Sometimes the
performance institute in Vegas,

32
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,610
every time we get to camp, me and him, we
got to think if one of us getting camp,

33
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:40,050
we already know I'm a contact
him. You gotta fight when
we go into Vegas. So I go,

34
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:43,740
we go out there for a week or two weeks.
Me, him and Rex Harris, he was in the Pff,

35
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,950
we call each other. The bass pro's only
three dudes that you'll see in Jersey.

36
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,320
We didn't traveled around.
We'd been to Vegas,

37
00:01:49,321 --> 00:01:52,950
we've been to Arizona or
wherever we go and we go hard.

38
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:54,630
And that's why we call it a basketball.
There's no,

39
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:59,190
oh we're going light today bro. Don't hit
me every time. It's like, are we ready?

40
00:01:59,191 --> 00:02:01,950
You Ready? Rex actually texted me
was gonna take Mo. He was like, yeah,

41
00:02:01,951 --> 00:02:04,890
I'll be there tomorrow cause I'm flying
here and I'll get back in time for

42
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:08,970
training. So Bass Bros meet up and
we'd go at it. That's it. Are you,

43
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:12,660
are you always far and hard or do
you spark? We got certain days,

44
00:02:12,661 --> 00:02:13,830
like if we don't want to spoil heart,

45
00:02:13,831 --> 00:02:18,240
we know not to go with each other because
it's kind of like if one week I get

46
00:02:18,241 --> 00:02:19,260
the best of wrecks.

47
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:23,280
Like there's been times like I had Carl
for we're OSP cause he south Pauling

48
00:02:23,281 --> 00:02:25,350
super good.
So I won't recall three rounds heart.

49
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,840
So it was his main focus was take down,
no let them up.

50
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:30,090
So I take him down and beat him
on the ground, feet on the ground,

51
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,190
taking him down and beat him on the ground
cause he didn't have wrestling at the

52
00:02:32,191 --> 00:02:34,830
time. And then he would go
with like somebody else.

53
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:38,190
Like I need one more around and
he'd be mad a lot. I know that,

54
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,050
but that's why I'm not going home
on the fourth, the fourth round,

55
00:02:40,051 --> 00:02:42,520
cause he's mad and he'd go out
there with somebody else and just,

56
00:02:42,521 --> 00:02:45,900
you just eat them up. It's like,
I'm sorry, I have to apologize.

57
00:02:45,901 --> 00:02:48,840
The other guy like I'm sorry for
beating him up because the hostility.

58
00:02:48,841 --> 00:02:49,770
So we go hard,

59
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:52,950
but there's times we pull other guys and
like I'm gonna call this amateur guy in

60
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:55,470
pretty good amateur or
a low level pro pro.

61
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,050
Some guys at 80 Alvarez knows
whenever I got this kid,

62
00:02:58,051 --> 00:03:01,620
he's pro two oh five he's the beginning
or whatever you want to work with him.

63
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:04,710
That's the guy. Bring him up to the,
I'm going to do a technical move day.

64
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,260
Kinda like wall work,
drilling. We sparring.

65
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,510
We have Hagar on just in case
cause accidents happened,

66
00:03:09,511 --> 00:03:12,210
but nothing has strong with
intention to hurt anybody.
