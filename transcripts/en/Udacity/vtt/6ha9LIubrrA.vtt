00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.680
Every single day iOS devices
are impacting the way we live and

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:07.270
interact with the world around us.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.820

you can begin your journey today and

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.430
start developing apps for iOS.

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:16.540
&gt;&gt; I had no coding
experience whatsoever.

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:20.235
I didn't even know what a loop was Udacity's
what gave me the confidence to be like,

00:00:20.235 --> 00:00:21.390
I can do that.

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.300
I can figure out how that works.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.760
&gt;&gt; It made it so that,
yes I'm working in my living room, but

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.680
I'm also working with
a great group of people.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:29.950
&gt;&gt; I was just checking my email, and

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:32.860
I got the email from Apple saying,
your app is now ready for sale.

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.500
