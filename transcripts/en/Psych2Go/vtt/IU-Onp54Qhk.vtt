Anxiety isn't fun for anyone

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:41.349
We all know what it's like to feel our stomach do flips or panic over things. We feel we have no control over

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.059
Some of us soak our clothes with sweat before a job interview or a presentation

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:52.180
Others have trouble forming words leaving them tongue-tied. These are our physical reactions to stress

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.499
Here are six signs. You might have anxiety and not even know it

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:58.309
one

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:04.239
Chronic headaches, if you have throbbing head pain, that won't stop coming back no matter what you do to treat it

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:09.339
Then you may be suffering from an anxiety disorder or at the very least chronic stress

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.989
Constant headaches and migraines are common for people who suffer from chronic anxiety

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:21.069
According to the American migraine foundation over fifty percent of those who have migraines also have anxiety

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.369
Don't worry

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:25.539
If this sounds like you there are a number of treatment options available

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:33.430
if over-the-counter pain relief doesn't work for you, you might benefit from anti-anxiety medication or cognitive therapy to

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:35.900
excessive bathroom use

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.599
Do you often need to use the bathroom before major exams or large social events?

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:46.449
One study in 2011 revealed a strong correlation between a heightened need to urinate and anxiety

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:52.539
Kyle Staller MD states that stress also causes irregularity in our bowel movements

00:01:52.759 --> 00:02:00.219
The nervous butterflies in your stomach are actually spasms in your intestinal tract, which can speed up the digestion process and give you diarrhea

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:08.649
Sometimes the spasms only occur in one area of your system leaving a blockage in another this can lead to constipation

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:10.640
three

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.879
Muscle tension ever feels sore in your neck or back or catch yourself clenching your jaw

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.509
That body stiffness is most likely a product of stress

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:25.390
Body tension can be so long-lasting that many people actually become used to their problem areas

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.159
Don't normalize tension pain is your body's Way of telling you to de-stress

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.980
Loosen your muscles with regular exercise

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.230
Activities like jogging yoga or even a brisk walk can help to reduce muscle stiffness

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:39.670
good habits

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.420
Like regular stretching and meditation also work wonders on the body

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:50.949
if you experience more severe muscle tension, you can invest in visiting a licensed masseuse every now and then for

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:52.790
perfectionism

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.569
There's nothing wrong with striving to do the best that you can

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.349
But there is a difference between doing your best and trying to be the best

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.489
Although it's useful to pay attention to detail being perfect is

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:05.889
Impossible and can bring stress to anyone

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:13.119
If you are someone who needs perfect outcomes ranging from work projects to planning the perfect relaxation day

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.729
You might be doing more harm to yourself than good

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:24.639
Psychologists sure in more links these behaviors to anxiety, which is related to our obsession over control and fear of failure

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:32.380

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:39.250
Trust issues. Do you often find yourself feeling threatened or intimidated when you meet new people?

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:47.019
Do you feel this despite all your other friends liking them your perception of events? Like this may be affected by anxiety a

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:54.039
2016 study shows that people with anxiety are less able to differentiate between safe and negative situations

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:59.769
One may believe they are simply being smart by keeping their guard up to protect themselves from possible social threats

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:03.999
But this wall stems more from a fear of being vulnerable and forming connections

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:06.319
6

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:10.839
Nail biting biting or picking your nails may seem just like a regular habit

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.720
It gives you something to do to keep your mouth and hands busy

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:17.709
Some people don't even realize they are doing it until someone else points it out

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:23.439
But nail biting is not always just to have it for many. It is a reaction to stress and anxiety

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:27.309
People often bite their nails in an attempt to relieve tension

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:33.160
there are other common tics and habits that people hold - as well such as hair or eyebrow pulling

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:37.029
Itching a specific area of the body and foot-tapping just to name a few
