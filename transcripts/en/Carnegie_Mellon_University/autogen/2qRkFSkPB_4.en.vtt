one of the pre-college offerings here on

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:15.650
one of the pre-college offerings here on
 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.550
one of the pre-college offerings here on
Carnegie Mellon's campus and it is

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:18.560
Carnegie Mellon's campus and it is
 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.359
Carnegie Mellon's campus and it is
really designed to enhance the profile

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:22.369
really designed to enhance the profile
 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:24.940
really designed to enhance the profile
of underrepresented minority students

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:24.950
of underrepresented minority students
 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:26.859
of underrepresented minority students
interested in math and science and

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:26.869
interested in math and science and
 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:28.060
interested in math and science and
others who are interested in math and

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:28.070
others who are interested in math and
 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.659
others who are interested in math and
science and to hopefully give them the

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:31.669
science and to hopefully give them the
 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:34.270
science and to hopefully give them the
skills and the exposure that will be

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280
skills and the exposure that will be
 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.910
skills and the exposure that will be
necessary for them to enroll in

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920
necessary for them to enroll in
 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:43.650
necessary for them to enroll in
comparable schools and Carnegie Mellon

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:43.660
 
 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.319
 
I think what makes our program unique is

00:00:46.319 --> 00:00:46.329
I think what makes our program unique is
 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:49.830
I think what makes our program unique is
the fact that we're looking at the good

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:49.840
the fact that we're looking at the good
 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.950
the fact that we're looking at the good
student we're they they have some

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:52.960
student we're they they have some
 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.470
student we're they they have some
concerns academically but we're trying

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:55.480
concerns academically but we're trying
 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.790
concerns academically but we're trying
to fill those gaps and create a better

00:00:59.790 --> 00:00:59.800
to fill those gaps and create a better
 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.100
to fill those gaps and create a better
student so our motto is making good

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.110
student so our motto is making good
 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:07.390
student so our motto is making good
students excellent

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400
 
 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.250
 
so SAT and the actr

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:11.260
so SAT and the actr
 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.980
so SAT and the actr
oftentimes the the scores on those

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990
oftentimes the the scores on those
 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.360
oftentimes the the scores on those
particular tests sometimes are

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:18.370
particular tests sometimes are
 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.650
particular tests sometimes are
problematic for this population of

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:20.660
problematic for this population of
 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.230
problematic for this population of
students and they're they're good

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240
students and they're they're good
 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.890
students and they're they're good
students and they're their high school

they have a set of skills but they can't
 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.850
they have a set of skills but they can't
figure out how to do real to really

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860
figure out how to do real to really
 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.180
figure out how to do real to really
master the test so that's a critical

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:37.190
master the test so that's a critical
 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:42.000
master the test so that's a critical
piece of our curricula is we

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.010
 
 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.870
 
we we have not only the academic

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880
we we have not only the academic
 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.280
we we have not only the academic
curriculum but we have hands-on

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290
curriculum but we have hands-on
 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.710
curriculum but we have hands-on
engineering and science projects in fact

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720
engineering and science projects in fact
 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.050
engineering and science projects in fact
this year we have the largest number of

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060
this year we have the largest number of
 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.210
this year we have the largest number of
projects that we've ever had we have 12

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220
projects that we've ever had we have 12
 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.250
projects that we've ever had we have 12
projects that the students will be

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:56.260
projects that the students will be
 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.690
projects that the students will be
engaging in we have a project in rocket

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700
engaging in we have a project in rocket
 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.910
engaging in we have a project in rocket
engineering and it's really talking

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920
engineering and it's really talking
 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.730
engineering and it's really talking
about the physics that's involved in

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740
about the physics that's involved in
 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.580
about the physics that's involved in
producing a rocket of a project and

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590
producing a rocket of a project and
 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.170
producing a rocket of a project and
civil engineering where they're talking

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:10.180
civil engineering where they're talking
 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:12.000
civil engineering where they're talking
about building bridges and they're going

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010
about building bridges and they're going
 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.430
about building bridges and they're going
around in Pittsburgh and looking at some

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440
around in Pittsburgh and looking at some
 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:20.050
around in Pittsburgh and looking at some
of the bridges we have here in the city

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060
 
 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.870
 
we've had over 800 students who've gone

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880
we've had over 800 students who've gone
 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.480
we've had over 800 students who've gone
through the program over the 10 years we

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:25.490
through the program over the 10 years we
 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.060
through the program over the 10 years we
have 83 who enrolled here at Carnegie

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070
have 83 who enrolled here at Carnegie
 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.060
have 83 who enrolled here at Carnegie
Mellon and the largest percentage of

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070
Mellon and the largest percentage of
 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:32.680
Mellon and the largest percentage of
them are in the engineering and and

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690
them are in the engineering and and
 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.260
them are in the engineering and and
science colleges I think success comes

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270
science colleges I think success comes
 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.750
science colleges I think success comes
in lots of different ways and but I do

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760
in lots of different ways and but I do
 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.230
in lots of different ways and but I do
think we've been successful
