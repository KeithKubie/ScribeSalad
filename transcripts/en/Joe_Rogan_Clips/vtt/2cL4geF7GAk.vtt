1
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.630
The Joe Rogan experience.
Yeah.
You know,
for for someone who was,
you know,

2
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.700
used to have to hide it before.
Yeah.
In you know,

3
00:00:08.701 --> 00:00:10.080
that's the beauty of it now is it,

4
00:00:10.081 --> 00:00:13.050
you don't have to hide it and people that used to,
you know,

5
00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:18.090
you got people now that you've never thought were smokers and you know,

6
00:00:18.091 --> 00:00:22.380
now they're coming out and just being totally free with it and that's great man.

7
00:00:22.381 --> 00:00:25.560
You know,
cause that have laptop.
What the fuck is that?

8
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.000
Oh hemp types be a cover but yeah,
that's pretty cool.
How could it be a cover of,

9
00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:32.160
it's like the USB ports and everything like that.

10
00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.460
They have those like skin covers.
It could just be a look a like,

11
00:00:35.461 --> 00:00:36.370
but it looks like it is.

12
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.860
They should make it really shouldn't miracle plant afar time.

13
00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:45.610
It is.
I got to agree.
It is.
It is.
Well listen brother,
you're a bad mother.

14
00:00:45.611 --> 00:00:49.620
Fucker is.
I really appreciate you.
Thank you brother forever for a long time.

15
00:00:49.621 --> 00:00:50.700
So it's cool to get in here.

16
00:00:50.701 --> 00:00:54.870
And when a hot boxes we're going to get in that small box.

17
00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.610
People been asking for you for a lot of time.
And I say this,
you know,

18
00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.100
in some of the,
some of the smoke boxes,
you know,
like,

19
00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.820
cause it's the realest shit.
Like we just had Mike Tyson in there,
you know,

20
00:01:05.821 --> 00:01:08.990
and um,
how,
where does it to smoke weed with my titles.

21
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.950
I've smoked with him before and,
and I,

22
00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.970
I've smoked with them on a couple of separate occasions aside from there.

23
00:01:14.971 --> 00:01:19.350
But one of the places that I smoked with him was at that fucking Leo Machida

24
00:01:19.351 --> 00:01:22.200
Rashad Evans fight when we all left,
you know,

25
00:01:22.201 --> 00:01:27.201
after the fight we were sort of getting to our cars and he ran into me and my

26
00:01:27.751 --> 00:01:30.850
partner Kenji and we were smoking a fat one right there.

27
00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.820
And they'd be real [inaudible] going to hit it at all.

28
00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.030
Right.
Fuck yeah.
Champion.
Here you go.
And,
and um,
you know,

29
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.840
we always knew he smoked out.
What was crazy about this interview?

30
00:01:42.841 --> 00:01:47.010
Real quick that I'll say it like,
cause you asked me this in this interview,

31
00:01:47.011 --> 00:01:49.510
like what did you do for the anxieties before?
Like,
you know,

32
00:01:49.511 --> 00:01:52.140
let's say we're going to go on stage or do the shit.
Right.

33
00:01:52.141 --> 00:01:56.370
So I asked him that similar question.
I said,
you know,
as artists,

34
00:01:56.371 --> 00:02:01.020
as athletes will before we're going to go do our thing in front of a mass amount

35
00:02:01.021 --> 00:02:05.340
of people,
you get this nervous energy,
what did you do to,
you know,

36
00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.680
deal with that?
And he said,
uh,
you think it hit in the time before fight?

37
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.260
Yeah.
You know,
and he was saying how he would,

38
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.760
the guys that work work with him would,
uh,

39
00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.900
instill these certain words,
like calmness,
you know,

40
00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.080
that would be a reoccurring word that they would do in the hypnosis,

41
00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.270
in hypnotizing them before a fight,

42
00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.280
so that he would always be calm in the fight and never fight desperate in,

43
00:02:32.281 --> 00:02:35.820
always be in control of the situation no matter what happened.

44
00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.130
And that's how he would,
you know,
get that nervous energy down and,
and,
uh,

45
00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.620
be able to fight with such focus.

46
00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.370
But the other interesting thing he said was that he never fought.
I mean,

47
00:02:47.371 --> 00:02:49.170
he was smoking the whole time,
you know,

48
00:02:49.171 --> 00:02:52.440
he's a big weed head since he was like 10 years old apparently.

49
00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.140
But he said that he was smoking,
you know,

50
00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.510
but not necessarily when he was training,

51
00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.330
they would give him when he was training,
you know,
shit,

52
00:03:01.331 --> 00:03:04.480
that he wouldn't feel nothing,
but he didn't have focus.

53
00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.650
What kind of pharmaceuticals?
He said,
uh,
some of it was fentinol,

54
00:03:08.651 --> 00:03:13.090
some Percocet,
some fentanyl wasn't even around back.
Well,
a form of it,
you know,

55
00:03:13.091 --> 00:03:15.070
like whatever.
Yeah,
it was a opiate.

56
00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.220
That was whatever the defense and all of that time,
whatever,

57
00:03:18.221 --> 00:03:19.600
I can't remember what he called it,

58
00:03:19.601 --> 00:03:22.690
but there was two or three prescription drugs that they would give him it,

59
00:03:22.691 --> 00:03:27.130
and he said he,
he wouldn't feel nothing.
He felt good.
Like there's no pain,

60
00:03:27.131 --> 00:03:31.020
no nothing.
But the focus that he had was,

61
00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.330
was not,
not there.
Right.

62
00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.180
He said that he smoked weed in one fight.

63
00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.590
Like he smoked weed before one particular fight and,

64
00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.610
and he used the wizard Nader to get through the urine test.
Somehow.
He fucking,

65
00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.120
he says it in the interview and you know,

66
00:03:49.121 --> 00:03:53.230
he said that the fight that he had where he was smoked out was with Andrew

67
00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:54.080
Gelada.
Why?

68
00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:59.130
He said he'd never had so much focus in a fight that it made him realize he

69
00:03:59.261 --> 00:04:03.850
should've been smoking weed through every goddamn fight because he focused on

70
00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:08.700
everything he was supposed to.
He said he broke his cheek,
he broke his,
uh,

71
00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:11.860
cheek here.
It orbital broke his orbital.

72
00:04:11.861 --> 00:04:16.840
He broke a rib and part of his back with a body shots,
Christ.

73
00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.040
And he said,
you know,

74
00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.750
that was the fight that was the one and only fight that he smoked out
beforehand.

75
00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:28.000
And Andrew Galata got,
he got a flat line.
He had Andrew go out of left the ring.

76
00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:32.380
He was like,
fuck this.
And Andrew Gelada had been through wars.
Oh yeah,
man.

77
00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.650
Really?
Both fights were crazy.
Riddick Bowe fights.
I mean,

78
00:04:35.651 --> 00:04:39.910
cause Riddick Bowe was really good,
you know,
but,
um,
he didn't hit like Mike.
No,

79
00:04:39.911 --> 00:04:42.310
no,
no,
no,
no.
I don't think no one hit like Mike,

80
00:04:42.311 --> 00:04:45.430
if you look at like some of his early training oh,
crazy.

81
00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:47.650
He was so crazy back then.

82
00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:51.970
If you look at some of my early training in his footwork,
it's almost like,

83
00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:54.910
you know,
almost like martial arts based,

84
00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:00.250
the way that he attacked and then he shifts on his attack and his foot was

85
00:05:00.251 --> 00:05:04.120
tomato custom motto was a master master.
Yeah.

86
00:05:04.121 --> 00:05:09.010
It wasn't until he switched up and got rid of Kevin Rooney and you know where

87
00:05:09.011 --> 00:05:12.790
the destruction starts out.
I think it was also his,
you know,

88
00:05:12.791 --> 00:05:15.790
his life was just too crazy.
It was just too crazy.

89
00:05:15.791 --> 00:05:19.960
No one can manage that from the time of these 20 to,
you know,

90
00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:25.090
by the time he retired,
I mean it was probably just a whirlwind of chaos.

91
00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:29.050
And it's crazy because he realizes that like looking back at it and he says that

92
00:05:29.051 --> 00:05:32.110
he doesn't train anymore because it awakens a beast.

93
00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:35.970
And he said that it made me nervous because it's headed,

94
00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:40.180
cause he said that to you too,
right?
Yeah.
Yeah,
yeah.
Cause I,
cause I was watching,

95
00:05:40.181 --> 00:05:43.360
you know,
your interview with them and uh,

96
00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:46.480
one of our guys that was in the backseat asked him,
Hey,
do you ever train?

97
00:05:46.481 --> 00:05:50.250
Do you ever,
you know,
it's like,
Nah,
I don't do that.
No.
Yeah,
he goes every night.

98
00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:53.770
I get on the treadmill and I do some running on the treadmill,
but that fit,

99
00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:57.230
I would imagine that if he got back and trained and he get in shape real quick,

100
00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:01.790
oh,
I'm sure it would awaken beast.
Yeah.
They're all like,

101
00:06:01.791 --> 00:06:06.230
you can't quit.
You can't quit.
He's like,
fuck you.
Fuck.
You just got up and left,

102
00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:09.650
pushed that guy away.
And he's like,
you're not filling these punches.

103
00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:14.360
He knew something was wrong.
Well,
he knew his joke was eyeball was broke too.

104
00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:18.350
Or is is uh,
they try to put the mouthpiece,
he put it in.
It's Lou [inaudible].

105
00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:23.300
Lou Duvel is that,
who is that guy looked like Lou.

106
00:06:23.301 --> 00:06:26.930
Do over for a second.
Yes,
I be,
you could tell his fucking face as buses.
Right.

107
00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:31.100
They're fairly normal,
but I'm sure it felt like shit,
you know,
like,

108
00:06:31.101 --> 00:06:35.630
it doesn't swell up real bad until later he listened.
You know,
if Andrew Gelada,

109
00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:39.860
you know,
who's been in wars,
you know,
with Riddick Bowe and other fighters,

110
00:06:39.861 --> 00:06:44.780
like he was no slouch.
If he's telling you I've had enough of this shit,

111
00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:48.770
I'm like,
well,
let him go.
Because he knows.

112
00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:52.250
Once they found out that his back was broken in,
his face was broken,

113
00:06:52.251 --> 00:06:55.100
they're probably like,
oh,
okay,
sorry.
Yeah.
I mean they think about that.

114
00:06:55.101 --> 00:06:59.000
His corner guy was like trying to put his mouth piece back so stupid once it
got,

115
00:06:59.001 --> 00:07:00.920
doesn't want to fight.
You can't make them fight more.

116
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.040
I mean it's like he's already flipped that switch inside of his head.

117
00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:07.670
You know what I told Mike that he didn't realize it.
This is the last thing,

118
00:07:07.671 --> 00:07:09.680
cause I know we both got to go,
but I said,

119
00:07:09.681 --> 00:07:14.480
do you know that all the dudes you fought to get to that title,

120
00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:18.650
including,
you know the dudes that you know that,
that you took titles from,

121
00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.110
they all stopped fighting after you beat him.

122
00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:24.650
None of them wanted to come back and get nothing.

123
00:07:24.651 --> 00:07:27.200
They didn't want no part of that heavyweight title after that.

124
00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:31.430
He retired so many boxers.
Oh yeah.
He doesn't even realize that.

125
00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:36.200
Settled in Tony tubs.
Go down the line.
All of them.
He didn't retire.
Larry Holmes,

126
00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:39.020
Larry Holmes,
waiting until he went to jail and he's like,
I'm going to come back.

127
00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:44.510
Yup.
Yeah.
That's the only guy.
Bone crusher Smith.
Yep.
Yeah.
Tyro bigs.

128
00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:48.590
Ah,
definitely retired telling eggs.
And they were rivals at one point in time.

129
00:07:48.591 --> 00:07:53.320
Yeah.
He fucked Tyrrell big pretty good.
Leon Spinks.
He's like,
yeah,

130
00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:57.950
Michael's,
yeah.
You know what?
I had this title too long.
Cause a wrap.
Yeah.

131
00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:01.730
Check please.
And he told me just like,
I think,
you know what?

132
00:08:01.731 --> 00:08:04.910
I didn't even feel like that.
Yeah,
man know what he did.
He retired.

133
00:08:04.911 --> 00:08:08.930
A lot of people said,
we all saw it.
It was a force of nature.
Yeah.
And I told him,

134
00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:11.510
the other thing I told him real quick too was,
you know,

135
00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:14.570
like that explanation that he had on his documentary where he,

136
00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:17.600
as he's coming to the ring,
he knew he had the fight.
One,

137
00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:21.830
he could see it in their eyes and then once he steps into the ring,
he's a god.

138
00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:24.320
They're done.
Right.
And I told them,
you know,

139
00:08:24.321 --> 00:08:27.350
I was at that Bruce Seldon fight and um,

140
00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:33.190
I saw exactly what you explained in Bruce Seldon Cause Bruce Selden was knocking

141
00:08:33.801 --> 00:08:37.340
fools out left and right.
He was like a really good heavyweight.

142
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.290
The minute he got in there with Mikey Fan boyed out tasted that glove.

143
00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:45.860
Didn't want no more.
Yeah,
it was a experience.

144
00:08:45.861 --> 00:08:48.440
It wasn't just that you were fighting a guy who knew how to fight,

145
00:08:48.441 --> 00:08:52.850
but you were fighting Mike Tyson.
He was this idol.
He was this thing,

146
00:08:52.851 --> 00:08:55.740
this cultural phenomenon.
He was thought to be at that time.

147
00:08:55.741 --> 00:08:57.690
Everybody was thinking he's the greatest heavyweight of all time.

148
00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:01.620
Does a destroyer.
Yeah.
No one had an answer for him.
No.
You know,
sell,
didn't sell.

149
00:09:01.621 --> 00:09:05.910
Then he pretty much,
you know,
he was a fan.
That was his idol and he,

150
00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:07.560
he got totally got rocked.

151
00:09:07.561 --> 00:09:10.740
He was so huge at the time that when buster Douglas beat him,

152
00:09:10.741 --> 00:09:13.440
even though I knew he beat him,
I watched the fight afterwards.

153
00:09:13.441 --> 00:09:15.150
I couldn't believe it.
I'm like,
this is,

154
00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:19.010
he's going to get up and it's Bruce Selden.
I look out Jack Bruce Seldon ones,

155
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:22.680
he's a big boy and they're fucking tank.
Yeah.
And he was,

156
00:09:22.681 --> 00:09:24.420
he was knocking people out of me,

157
00:09:24.421 --> 00:09:27.600
look 29 knockouts and he was fighting good guys.
Oh yeah.

158
00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:31.530
Cause I WBA heavyweight champion and I followed his career too.

159
00:09:31.531 --> 00:09:35.130
You know what I mean?
And yeah,
he totally fan boyed out on Mike Man.
I'm like,

160
00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:37.830
well we'll get the stare down.
We've seen him in the stare down.

161
00:09:37.831 --> 00:09:42.330
You look at it that
it's like,
oh no,

162
00:09:42.331 --> 00:09:46.350
you made a tremendous mistake getting married to this mistake row.

163
00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:50.550
Look how much bigger Seldon is do it.
He's a big boy bro.

164
00:09:50.551 --> 00:09:52.110
He wasn't taking them to that shit.

165
00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:55.890
Tyson's footwork and his ability to close the distance and bobbing and weaving.

166
00:09:55.891 --> 00:09:58.860
I mean it was like there was nobody before him like that.
No Man,

167
00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:01.770
they'll never be another guy like that.
It's a heavy heavyweight.

168
00:10:01.771 --> 00:10:06.520
He was just so fast too because realistically the guys who trained him,
yeah,

169
00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:10.320
they had a certain technique and nobody uses it.
Well it's not just that,

170
00:10:10.321 --> 00:10:14.620
it was what Mike talked about in the podcast about being hypnotized.
Yeah.

171
00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:17.250
I mean from the time he was a little boy and you know,

172
00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:21.840
the fact that he had nothing before that everything was,
his life was shit.

173
00:10:21.841 --> 00:10:24.030
It was all pain and suffering and poverty.

174
00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:27.060
And then all of a sudden some guy comes along and rescues him and takes him,

175
00:10:27.061 --> 00:10:27.990
teaches him out of box,

176
00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:32.700
and then all of a sudden he gets recognition and positive feedback and he felt

177
00:10:32.701 --> 00:10:37.490
like he was something special.
Boom,
he fucking hit that campus Holler.

178
00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:38.813
He didn't want it.

179
00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:43.170
We kind of forget sometimes what it was like watching those fights to go back

180
00:10:43.171 --> 00:10:47.100
and watch them now.
I mean there's,
there's amazing fighters right now,
like the,

181
00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:51.690
like Terrence Crawford who just won a Saturday night.
Amazing,
amazing boxers.

182
00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:56.040
But what Mike was,
was something,
he was something completely different.

183
00:10:56.390 --> 00:11:00.750
It was something that transcended sports.
Everybody wanted to see him fight,

184
00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:03.420
you know,
if you believe in conspiracy theories,
right?

185
00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:06.900
He didn't even hit him right there.
He just fell on purpose.
Right.

186
00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:10.710
If you believe in conspiracy theories,
right?
You think about it like this,
right?

187
00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:15.480
Mike was knocking guys out in the first round and people were paying a whole lot

188
00:11:15.481 --> 00:11:19.920
of money for,
for tickets and paper view.
You know when you look at it,

189
00:11:19.921 --> 00:11:24.360
it looks like they will try to slow his role and put in a guy like Evander

190
00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:28.080
Holyfield who was a brawler you could box but he could brawl and take the fight

191
00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:32.190
11 rounds and you know,
make it a fucking great pay per view.

192
00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:35.410
Where Mike with totally ruined the paper have you had knock your ass out in,

193
00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:36.313
in a minute.

194
00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:40.650
And when you look at it the way boxing was for such a long time,

195
00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:42.810
I wouldn't put it past it that,
you know,

196
00:11:42.811 --> 00:11:47.340
a lot of the shit that happened to them was manipulated so that it would slow

197
00:11:47.341 --> 00:11:51.630
his role.
What,
what,
what kind of Shit?
Like what do you mean?
Well,
you know,

198
00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:53.900
the people that he had him,
I mean,
you know,

199
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:57.400
certainly the daughter of the king around immediate,
he took all his,
his,
his,

200
00:11:57.430 --> 00:12:00.230
his people that he trusted away from them,

201
00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:02.500
put different trainers in his corner,

202
00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:06.980
different people that we're influencing him and did it just took him backwards

203
00:12:06.981 --> 00:12:11.260
and man and all the people that actually helped got him there were fucking gone.

204
00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:15.260
And those were the guys that was actually given him guidance as to,
you know,

205
00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:18.280
how to conduct yourself,
be a man and all that stuff.

206
00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:23.260
And he got around the vultures,
man.
And they,
and to me,
I think don king,

207
00:12:23.261 --> 00:12:26.630
being don king,
he stood in more money.

208
00:12:26.631 --> 00:12:31.060
He stood a chance to make more money with someone taking out the fight,
you know,

209
00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:34.150
11 to 12 rounds as opposed to one.
Well,
he just,

210
00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:37.990
he gave Mike the worst deals ever to win.
The whole thing was terrible.

211
00:12:37.991 --> 00:12:41.620
He stole money from him.
To this day,
my hates.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's all terrible.
