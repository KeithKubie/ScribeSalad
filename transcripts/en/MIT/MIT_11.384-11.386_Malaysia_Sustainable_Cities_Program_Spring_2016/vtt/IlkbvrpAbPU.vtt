00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:12.710
The climate is changing.

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:14.940
Low carbon development
is an approach

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.780
to reducing carbon
dioxide emission

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:19.770
and mitigating global warming.

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.140
Human activities
in cities produced

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.480
78% of global carbon emission.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.690
This is because most
cities rely heavily

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:33.340
on fossil fuel-based energy.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.820
Low carbon development
refers to ways

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.160
of shaping economic growth
so that greenhouse gas

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.590
emissions can be kept to levels
that can be absorbed by nature.

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.780
Low carbon development
involves a push

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.800
towards simpler lifestyles
that rely on environmentally

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.940
friendly technologies.

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.130
Hello, my name is Isiaka
Adeyemi Abdul-Azeez,

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.810
and I'm a research scholar
with the MIT-UTM Malaysia

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:03.860
Sustainable Cities Program.

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.250
In this video, I will discuss
why and how low carbon

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.950
development is proceeding
in the second largest city

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.350
in Malaysia, Johor Bahru.

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.760
The city is in the
Iskandar Malaysia region,

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.780
which has announced a goal of
reducing carbon emission by 58%

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.630
by year 2025.

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.210
I will reflect on some of
the city's achievements

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.700
and the challenges it faces
in meeting that target.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.540
Johor Bahru is one of the
five local authorities

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.750
in Iskandar Malaysia region.

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.280
It is an important flagship
for low carbon development

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.800
in the region.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.360
The city is a regional
transport manufacturing hub

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.010
and a main shopping
destination for tourists

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.810
from Indonesia and Singapore.

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.440
At present, it very
disorganized and much

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.760
messier than its glitzy
neighbor Singapore.

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.050
In an effort to
compete with Singapore,

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.150
the Malaysian government
announced a commitment

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.639
to sustainable
urban development.

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:12.880
Its goal was to attract
foreign investment

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.180
in Johor Bahru's industrial,
commercial, and real estate

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.570
activities.

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.560
Economic investment
usually means

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.620
more construction of
buildings, more manufacturing

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:30.150
and industrial development, more
retail and shopping activities,

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.010
more concentration
of human activities,

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.990
and more energy consumption
for transport and electricity.

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.560
Under normal
circumstances, all these

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.020
would increased carbon emission.

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.830
However, the
government is trying

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.990
to promote economic growth while
reducing the carbon intensity.

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:51.440
How can this be done?

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.540
And how is low
carbon development

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.570
being practiced in Johor Bahru?

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:59.330
Two key organizations are
leading the low carbon

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.510
initiative in Johor Bahru.

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.880
The first is the Office
of Low Carbon Society,

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.170
at the University of Technology
in Malaysia, also called UTM.

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.270
Professor Ho Chin Siong, the
head of the Low Carbon Society

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:17.860
office at UTM explains
some of their practices

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.355
he has been trying to
encourage in Johor Bahru.

00:03:21.355 --> 00:03:26.270
We use the concept
of [INAUDIBLE], where

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:31.560
they have already some form of
[INAUDIBLE], or [INAUDIBLE],

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.150
and then other thing is
the climate change policy.

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.060
How can be integrate them
together in such a way

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.710
that urban planning
can decarbonize?

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:46.380
That plan basically guided
us how to be low carbon.

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.210
And then, from
there, we prepared

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:51.200
another plan called
the Road Map, that

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.360
is the [? implementation ?]
of the plan.

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.940
And then at the moment, we are
now going into more detail,

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:01.050
working with the local
authorities, with the mayors,

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:02.720
with the engineers.

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.530
The second
organization concerned

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.310
with promoting low carbon
development initiatives

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:12.640
in Johor Bahru is the Iskandar
Regional Development Authority,

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.870
also known as IRDA.

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.130
Together with UTM, IRDA, is
helping local authorities

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:24.810
prepare actions plans for
reducing carbon intensity.

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.140
Mr. Boyd Joeman
explains what IRDA

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:30.520
is doing along these lines.

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.120
The process of getting to
that point is very important.

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.970
So municipal, critical.

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:40.190
And that's why we are working
with the five local authorities

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.620
to prepare their own
low carbon action

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.180
plan at the municipal level.

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.090
Through that
process, we can then

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.890
say we have done one step
further from regional

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:52.126
to municipal.

00:04:52.126 --> 00:04:53.750
They can then look
at it from the point

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:56.900
of view of how they developed
their respective areas.

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:00.060
So we bring them
to Japan and let

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.780
them see a bigger picture-- how
it is being done in a developed

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:03.790
country.

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:07.410
And then they bring back, and
then the disseminate and share

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:08.570
the information.

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:12.230
So through that process,
IRDA can play a big role

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:15.620
in terms of making sure
that everyone is connected,

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:16.710
as it were.

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.880
Regarding what has been achieved
thus far in Johor Bahru,

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.070
Professor Ho has this to say.

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:24.880
The first thing, I
think, awareness.

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.720
Awareness of the [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.470
Low carbon strategy
is not a new term

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:31.760
anymore in this Iskandar
area or in [INAUDIBLE] area.

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:34.240
People are talking about
low carbon society.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.920
And people believe that,
actually, low carbon society

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:39.880
will improve the
quality of life.

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.860
Another achievement
is the creation

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:45.110
of environmentally
friendly rural communities.

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:47.900
One of these
villages, [INAUDIBLE],

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:51.310
has been supported by
the government as a model

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:53.610
for low carbon lifestyle.

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:55.770
The village has
implemented a series

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:58.930
of action plans in
various sectors,

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:02.550
such as agricultural
and waste disposal, that

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:07.530
demonstrates how a community
can live more sustainably.

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:11.450
[INAUDIBLE] project was
adopted by the residents

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:15.430
of [INAUDIBLE] and shows how
the population can benefit

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:19.060
socially, environmentally,
and economically

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:22.730
through various low carbon
development efforts.

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:25.450
Among the key obstacles
to promoting low carbon

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:27.840
development is
changing the mindset

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:30.980
of those who have
not embraced the need

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:33.030
to reduce carbon intensity.

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:37.130
Professor Ho offers some
suggestions regarding ways

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:39.050
of changing local thinking.

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:40.550
The [INAUDIBLE]
approach is actually

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:42.540
focusing on co-benefits.

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:45.740
I think it's too early stage
for the [INAUDIBLE] country,

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:48.660
when they tell them, OK,
let's go for low carbon.

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:49.690
Let's save the planet.

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:54.810
Let's cut down CO2, it may not
make sense to many of them.

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:57.580
But if you tell them that there
is a co-benefit-- for instance,

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:02.200
by going low carbon,
you can save money.

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:04.120
By having low carbon
you have a co-benefit

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:09.070
of better air quality, better
health, better quality of life.

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:13.300
By having even going
green, or low carbon,

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:15.260
you can do composting,
or you can do recycling,

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.000
and then by doing
that activities,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.372
you can generate certain
extra income for the family.

00:07:21.372 --> 00:07:23.080
Those are co-benefit,
I believe strongly,

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:28.740
that help us to promote it.

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:33.690
Measuring and monitoring carbon
emissions from electricity

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:37.450
and the transport sector
is carried out for IRDA

00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:44.264
by UTM and Japanese researchers,
as Mr. Boyd Joeman explains.

00:07:44.264 --> 00:07:46.520
Through the Low Carbon
Society blueprint,

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:49.870
which was prepared by UTM in
Japan, [INAUDIBLE] University

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:54.210
and [INAUDIBLE]
University and the NIS.

00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:56.950
Through that, they did
the homework, i.e.,

00:07:56.950 --> 00:08:03.290
what are the existing emissions
or the output of electricity,

00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:05.050
for example, or transport.

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:07.880
So from then on, we have
a base figure, 2005.

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:09.430
At this point, it's
being monitored

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:11.600
through the project, i.e.

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:13.460
by UTM in Japan.

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:17.640
But eventually, IRDA needs
to sit down and monitor

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:18.940
it ourselves.

00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:22.090
One cannot manage what
one cannot measure,

00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:26.650
and monitoring is only possible
once there is agreement on what

00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:28.270
to measure.

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:31.780
Emissions from transport
and electricity production

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:34.760
must be measured and monitored.

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:38.669
MOSFET is an emissions
measuring tool

00:08:38.669 --> 00:08:42.630
that is being used to assess
carbon dioxide emission

00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:45.720
from transport and electricity.

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:49.630
The tool measures fossil
fuel-based energy use

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:52.840
by category, type, and sector.

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:58.420
It inventories electricity use
in kilowatt hours and liters

00:08:58.420 --> 00:08:59.720
of fuels.

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:04.660
These are automatically
converted into carbon dioxide

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:06.010
equivalents.

00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:08.590
The emission
reduction goal can be

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:11.970
achieved using MOSFET
to monitor the carbon

00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:16.760
reduction from transport and
electricity in Johor Bahru.

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:21.330
The Malaysian economy is
growing at almost 2% per year,

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:25.320
so reducing carbon
intensity will not be easy.

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:27.830
The way forward is
to create support

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:30.180
for the world we
want to live in.

00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:33.110
Reducing carbon intensity
and promoting low carbon

00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:36.370
development in Johor
Bahru and elsewhere

00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:39.980
would require a change in
the mindset of many people.

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:43.820
It will also be necessary
to agree on what to measure

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:46.370
and how to monitor
changes in carbon

00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:49.040
intensity in each sector.

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:51.810
More low carbon
model villages should

00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:55.870
be created to show how low
carbon development can meet

00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:58.380
the needs of the population.

00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:02.040
Other experiments and
prototype living arrangements

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:07.160
will be necessary to convince
people that change is possible.

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:12.410
Shifting to clean energy will
undoubtedly be important.

00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:15.500
Along these lines, Johor
Bahru will probably

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:19.240
need to implement
financial incentives

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:22.660
to encourage investment
in renewable energy,

00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:27.320
along with multiple changes
in consumer behavior.

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:30.340
City planners will
need to explain

00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:34.740
what less energy intensive
patterns of development

00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:36.910
might look like.
