times I have done a fair amount of work
on animations I also help out with the

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030
on animations I also help out with the
 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.450
on animations I also help out with the

graphics goodies very nice excellent all
right so let's let's get started our

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040
right so let's let's get started our
 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.590
right so let's let's get started our
first question is from andrew hughes

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600
first question is from andrew hughes
 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.770
first question is from andrew hughes
from a san luis obispo in california he

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780
from a san luis obispo in california he
 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.899
from a san luis obispo in california he
asks that let's say you have a view

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909
asks that let's say you have a view
 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.730
asks that let's say you have a view
group that is added directly to the

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740
group that is added directly to the
 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.190
group that is added directly to the
benefit to the window manager such as a

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200
benefit to the window manager such as a
 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.830
benefit to the window manager such as a
pop up and a child views layout changes

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840
pop up and a child views layout changes
 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.569
pop up and a child views layout changes
size causing the entire pop up view to

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579
size causing the entire pop up view to
 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.760
size causing the entire pop up view to
change size how would you animate the

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770
change size how would you animate the
 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.910
change size how would you animate the
view groups size change is watch the dev

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920
view groups size change is watch the dev
 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.219
view groups size change is watch the dev
bites on layout transitions and he's

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229
bites on layout transitions and he's
 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.749
bites on layout transitions and he's
tried to set that layout transition

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759
tried to set that layout transition
 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.090
tried to set that layout transition
using the transition layout changing on

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100
using the transition layout changing on
 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.010
using the transition layout changing on
the view group that's added to the

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020
the view group that's added to the
 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.450
the view group that's added to the
window manager this causes the child

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460
window manager this causes the child
 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.910
window manager this causes the child
view whose size change to animate to the

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920
view whose size change to animate to the
 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.399
view whose size change to animate to the
new size but the parent viewgroup just

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409
new size but the parent viewgroup just
 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.469
new size but the parent viewgroup just
jumps to the new size without anime yeah

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479
jumps to the new size without anime yeah
 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.120
jumps to the new size without anime yeah
so the way that I think about layout

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130
so the way that I think about layout
 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:02.620
so the way that I think about layout
transition is it's really good at doing

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630
transition is it's really good at doing
 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.300
transition is it's really good at doing
very specific things and sometimes you

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310
very specific things and sometimes you
 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.249
very specific things and sometimes you
fall without outside of the bounds of

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259
fall without outside of the bounds of
 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.419
fall without outside of the bounds of
what those specific things are

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429
what those specific things are
 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.059
what those specific things are
and you Andrew have just done so the

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069
and you Andrew have just done so the
 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:14.759
and you Andrew have just done so the
problem is rotations that viewgroup does

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769
problem is rotations that viewgroup does
 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:17.309
problem is rotations that viewgroup does
not have a parent in your situation and

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319
not have a parent in your situation and
 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:18.479
not have a parent in your situation and
what you really need to do is set a

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489
what you really need to do is set a
 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:20.640
what you really need to do is set a
layout transition on the parent of the

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650
layout transition on the parent of the
 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.380
layout transition on the parent of the
children or of the view hierarchy that

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390
children or of the view hierarchy that
 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.080
children or of the view hierarchy that
you want to automatically animate so if

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090
you want to automatically animate so if
 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.379
you want to automatically animate so if
there was a way to have a parent there

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:27.389
there was a way to have a parent there
 

00:02:27.389 --> 00:02:30.629
there was a way to have a parent there
then you would set the way a transition

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:30.639
then you would set the way a transition
 

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:33.809
then you would set the way a transition
on that instead if not you're it's up to

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:33.819
on that instead if not you're it's up to
 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:35.879
on that instead if not you're it's up to
you you could use similar techniques to

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:35.889
you you could use similar techniques to
 

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:38.190
you you could use similar techniques to
animate the bounds of the view group

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200
animate the bounds of the view group
 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.780
animate the bounds of the view group
although you're actually resizing the

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790
although you're actually resizing the
 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.339
although you're actually resizing the
window so you're probably down to doing

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:41.349
window so you're probably down to doing
 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:44.460
window so you're probably down to doing
expensive things like actually changing

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470
expensive things like actually changing
 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.740
expensive things like actually changing
I don't know window manager layout

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750
I don't know window manager layout
 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.780
I don't know window manager layout
params to actually resize the window

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790
params to actually resize the window
 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.330
params to actually resize the window
which is going to be kind of costly you

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340
which is going to be kind of costly you
 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.000
which is going to be kind of costly you
may instead do something different like

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010
may instead do something different like
 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:55.920
may instead do something different like
actually pop up a window that is of the

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930
actually pop up a window that is of the
 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.110
actually pop up a window that is of the
correct size but you're animating over a

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120
correct size but you're animating over a
 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.849
correct size but you're animating over a
transparent area and sort of faking out

00:02:59.849 --> 00:02:59.859
transparent area and sort of faking out
 

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:02.220
transparent area and sort of faking out
what it looks like to the user there's a

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230
what it looks like to the user there's a
 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.140
what it looks like to the user there's a
another technique that we demonstrated

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150
another technique that we demonstrated
 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:05.729
another technique that we demonstrated
at i/o and they will be coming out as a

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739
at i/o and they will be coming out as a
 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:07.170
at i/o and they will be coming out as a
dev light soon wait a minute no it came

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180
dev light soon wait a minute no it came
 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.179
dev light soon wait a minute no it came
out two weeks ago they called activity

00:03:09.179 --> 00:03:09.189
out two weeks ago they called activity
 

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:10.920
out two weeks ago they called activity
animations which is about launching

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930
animations which is about launching
 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.199
animations which is about launching
activities with transparent backgrounds

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209
activities with transparent backgrounds
 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:15.059
activities with transparent backgrounds
to sort of fake out the fact that the

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069
to sort of fake out the fact that the
 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:16.439
to sort of fake out the fact that the
activity is there but we're going to

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:16.449
activity is there but we're going to
 

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:18.809
activity is there but we're going to
animate into it maybe you could do

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:18.819
animate into it maybe you could do
 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:21.180
animate into it maybe you could do
something like that in this situation to

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190
something like that in this situation to
 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:22.740
something like that in this situation to
basically not have it at the full size

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750
basically not have it at the full size
 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.330
basically not have it at the full size
when it begins but then sort of animate

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340
when it begins but then sort of animate
 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:25.520
when it begins but then sort of animate

00:10:07.829 --> 00:10:10.129
the finger was moving when they let go
and if it's moving under a certain speed

00:10:10.129 --> 00:10:10.139
and if it's moving under a certain speed
 

00:10:10.139 --> 00:10:11.840
and if it's moving under a certain speed
then we'll actually snap it back based

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:11.850
then we'll actually snap it back based
 

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:13.730
then we'll actually snap it back based
on that information otherwise we'll

00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:13.740
on that information otherwise we'll
 

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:16.189
on that information otherwise we'll
animate it off the screen based on the

00:10:16.189 --> 00:10:16.199
animate it off the screen based on the
 

00:10:16.199 --> 00:10:18.530
animate it off the screen based on the
velocity that the the finger was moving

00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:18.540
velocity that the the finger was moving
 

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:20.840
velocity that the the finger was moving
it that's a little bit more effective it

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:20.850
it that's a little bit more effective it
 

00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:22.720
it that's a little bit more effective it
gives the user a little bit better

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:22.730
gives the user a little bit better
 

00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:24.650
gives the user a little bit better

WYSIWYG manner than the simple demo that

00:10:28.579 --> 00:10:28.589
WYSIWYG manner than the simple demo that
 

00:10:28.589 --> 00:10:30.230
WYSIWYG manner than the simple demo that
we have you can only see the mechanics

00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:30.240
we have you can only see the mechanics
 

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:32.300
we have you can only see the mechanics
of actually animating the item out or

00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:32.310
of actually animating the item out or
 

00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:33.449
of actually animating the item out or
back in and then

00:10:33.449 --> 00:10:33.459
back in and then
 

00:10:33.459 --> 00:10:35.400
back in and then
the gap closed which was the real intent

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:35.410
the gap closed which was the real intent
 

00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:37.049
the gap closed which was the real intent
of that demo so that's interesting so

00:10:37.049 --> 00:10:37.059
of that demo so that's interesting so
 

00:10:37.059 --> 00:10:38.999
of that demo so that's interesting so
it's actually more intuitive for people

00:10:38.999 --> 00:10:39.009
it's actually more intuitive for people
 

00:10:39.009 --> 00:10:41.309
it's actually more intuitive for people
using an app to base it on velocity of

00:10:41.309 --> 00:10:41.319
using an app to base it on velocity of
 

00:10:41.319 --> 00:10:42.509
using an app to base it on velocity of
finger movement rather than on the

00:10:42.509 --> 00:10:42.519
finger movement rather than on the
 

00:10:42.519 --> 00:10:44.460
finger movement rather than on the
distance which you're transitioning the

00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:44.470
distance which you're transitioning the
 

00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:46.799

object off the screen well it was very

00:10:46.799 --> 00:10:46.809
object off the screen well it was very
 

00:10:46.809 --> 00:10:49.949
object off the screen well it was very
easy for me to base it on distance yes

00:10:49.949 --> 00:10:49.959
easy for me to base it on distance yes
 

00:10:49.959 --> 00:10:52.559
easy for me to base it on distance yes
yeah I would think it's not that much

00:10:52.559 --> 00:10:52.569
yeah I would think it's not that much
 

00:10:52.569 --> 00:10:54.210
yeah I would think it's not that much
harder to use velocity instead

00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:54.220
harder to use velocity instead
 

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:55.619
harder to use velocity instead
especially since we have velocity

00:10:55.619 --> 00:10:55.629
especially since we have velocity
 

00:10:55.629 --> 00:10:57.419
especially since we have velocity

people really like the way that new
 

00:11:23.259 --> 00:11:26.009
people really like the way that new

messages animate in isn't that on the
 

00:11:26.019 --> 00:11:28.530

about creating a sequence of animations

00:11:34.199 --> 00:11:34.209

don't have a pat answer for you because

00:11:43.169 --> 00:11:43.179
don't have a pat answer for you because
 

00:11:43.179 --> 00:11:44.669

you're typing text into an edit text

00:11:49.799 --> 00:11:49.809
you're typing text into an edit text
 

00:11:49.809 --> 00:11:52.439
you're typing text into an edit text
with a certain font size and then you

00:11:52.439 --> 00:11:52.449
with a certain font size and then you
 

00:11:52.449 --> 00:11:56.069
with a certain font size and then you
want to place it as just a text view you

00:11:56.069 --> 00:11:56.079
want to place it as just a text view you
 

00:11:56.079 --> 00:11:57.780
want to place it as just a text view you
know a non editable text view in the

00:11:57.780 --> 00:11:57.790
know a non editable text view in the
 

00:11:57.790 --> 00:11:59.539

well does that have the same font size

00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:02.290
well does that have the same font size
 

00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:04.259
well does that have the same font size
and what are what's the text going to

00:12:04.259 --> 00:12:04.269
and what are what's the text going to
 

00:12:04.269 --> 00:12:05.609
and what are what's the text going to
look like in that view and how does that

00:12:05.609 --> 00:12:05.619
look like in that view and how does that
 

00:12:05.619 --> 00:12:07.799
look like in that view and how does that
compare to how the text looks like in

00:12:07.799 --> 00:12:07.809
compare to how the text looks like in
 

00:12:07.809 --> 00:12:09.269
compare to how the text looks like in
the edit text so how do you actually

00:12:09.269 --> 00:12:09.279
the edit text so how do you actually
 

00:12:09.279 --> 00:12:11.699
the edit text so how do you actually
animate from one view that is completely

00:12:11.699 --> 00:12:11.709
animate from one view that is completely
 

00:12:11.709 --> 00:12:14.160
animate from one view that is completely
different into another view with the

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:14.170
different into another view with the
 

00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:15.960
different into another view with the
same text but maybe different text

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:15.970
same text but maybe different text
 

00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:17.730
same text but maybe different text
characteristics or at least different

00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:17.740
characteristics or at least different
 

00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:19.470
characteristics or at least different
text measurement because it's not

00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:19.480
text measurement because it's not
 

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:20.850
text measurement because it's not
exactly like the edittext so there's

00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:20.860
exactly like the edittext so there's
 

00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:24.840
exactly like the edittext so there's
some tricky nuances there about even if

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:24.850
some tricky nuances there about even if
 

00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:26.309
some tricky nuances there about even if
you have the same size text you want to

00:12:26.309 --> 00:12:26.319
you have the same size text you want to
 

00:12:26.319 --> 00:12:27.840
you have the same size text you want to
make sure that you're actually going to

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:27.850
make sure that you're actually going to
 

00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:29.400
make sure that you're actually going to
animate it from into the correct

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:29.410
animate it from into the correct
 

00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:31.799
animate it from into the correct
locations in these completely different

locations in these completely different
 

00:12:31.809 --> 00:12:34.980
locations in these completely different
view and layout situations so assuming

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:34.990
view and layout situations so assuming
 

00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:36.299
view and layout situations so assuming
that you can actually solve that problem

00:12:36.299 --> 00:12:36.309
that you can actually solve that problem
 

00:12:36.309 --> 00:12:38.069
that you can actually solve that problem
or that you're actually animating the

00:12:38.069 --> 00:12:38.079
or that you're actually animating the
 

00:12:38.079 --> 00:12:39.780
or that you're actually animating the
same kind of view or you can fake it out

00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:39.790
same kind of view or you can fake it out
 

00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:41.069

well enough or you can cross fade

00:12:41.069 --> 00:12:41.079
well enough or you can cross fade
 

00:12:41.079 --> 00:12:41.879

the other element here is to have the

00:12:44.609 --> 00:12:44.619
the other element here is to have the
 

00:12:44.619 --> 00:12:46.530
the other element here is to have the
ability to basically do a flyover of

00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:46.540
ability to basically do a flyover of
 

00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:48.869
ability to basically do a flyover of
views what you want to do is move a view

00:12:48.869 --> 00:12:48.879
views what you want to do is move a view
 

00:12:48.879 --> 00:12:51.299
views what you want to do is move a view
from one container to another or at

00:12:51.299 --> 00:12:51.309
from one container to another or at
 

00:12:51.309 --> 00:12:53.579
from one container to another or at
least the facsimile of view one

00:12:53.579 --> 00:12:53.589
least the facsimile of view one
 

00:12:53.589 --> 00:12:55.229
least the facsimile of view one
important thing to note in graphics and

00:12:55.229 --> 00:12:55.239
important thing to note in graphics and
 

00:12:55.239 --> 00:12:59.999
important thing to note in graphics and
animation is it's not necessarily it's

00:12:59.999 --> 00:13:00.009
animation is it's not necessarily it's
 

00:13:00.009 --> 00:13:01.859
animation is it's not necessarily it's
not always necessary to do the right

00:13:01.859 --> 00:13:01.869
not always necessary to do the right
 

00:13:01.869 --> 00:13:03.659
not always necessary to do the right
thing as long as you do the thing that

00:13:03.659 --> 00:13:03.669
thing as long as you do the thing that
 

00:13:03.669 --> 00:13:06.900
thing as long as you do the thing that
looks good so in this case do you

00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:06.910
looks good so in this case do you
 

00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:08.970
looks good so in this case do you
actually need to fly a textview or is it

00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:08.980
actually need to fly a textview or is it
 

00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:10.739
actually need to fly a textview or is it
good enough to simply fly a graphical

00:13:10.739 --> 00:13:10.749
good enough to simply fly a graphical
 

00:13:10.749 --> 00:13:13.109
good enough to simply fly a graphical
representation of the text and you can

00:13:13.109 --> 00:13:13.119
representation of the text and you can
 

00:13:13.119 --> 00:13:14.669
representation of the text and you can
actually do either one if you want to

00:13:14.669 --> 00:13:14.679
actually do either one if you want to
 

00:13:14.679 --> 00:13:17.039
actually do either one if you want to
fly the just a bit map of the text you

00:13:17.039 --> 00:13:17.049
fly the just a bit map of the text you
 

00:13:17.049 --> 00:13:18.689
fly the just a bit map of the text you
can you know snapshot whatever it is

00:13:18.689 --> 00:13:18.699
can you know snapshot whatever it is
 

00:13:18.699 --> 00:13:20.699
can you know snapshot whatever it is
that you want to represent the text and

00:13:20.699 --> 00:13:20.709
that you want to represent the text and
 

00:13:20.709 --> 00:13:22.109
that you want to represent the text and
then you can basically have a custom

00:13:22.109 --> 00:13:22.119
then you can basically have a custom
 

00:13:22.119 --> 00:13:24.299
then you can basically have a custom
container that draws that on top of

00:13:24.299 --> 00:13:24.309
container that draws that on top of
 

00:13:24.309 --> 00:13:25.739
container that draws that on top of
everything else that's happening at the

00:13:25.739 --> 00:13:25.749
everything else that's happening at the
 

00:13:25.749 --> 00:13:27.929
everything else that's happening at the
same time you could also take a view

00:13:27.929 --> 00:13:27.939
same time you could also take a view
 

00:13:27.939 --> 00:13:29.999
same time you could also take a view
basically create a view on the fly or

00:13:29.999 --> 00:13:30.009
basically create a view on the fly or
 

00:13:30.009 --> 00:13:32.999
basically create a view on the fly or
remove that view that you had from the

00:13:32.999 --> 00:13:33.009
remove that view that you had from the
 

00:13:33.009 --> 00:13:34.319
remove that view that you had from the
parent that it was in and then place it

00:13:34.319 --> 00:13:34.329
parent that it was in and then place it
 

00:13:34.329 --> 00:13:37.379
parent that it was in and then place it
in an overlay container and then animate

00:13:37.379 --> 00:13:37.389
in an overlay container and then animate
 

00:13:37.389 --> 00:13:40.169
in an overlay container and then animate
that and the way that works is if if you

00:13:40.169 --> 00:13:40.179
that and the way that works is if if you
 

00:13:40.179 --> 00:13:42.210
that and the way that works is if if you
picture layers of containers let's say

00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:42.220
picture layers of containers let's say
 

00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:44.970
picture layers of containers let's say
you have you have a frame layout and it

00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:44.980
you have you have a frame layout and it
 

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:46.590
you have you have a frame layout and it
has a list view in it which represents

00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:46.600
has a list view in it which represents
 

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:49.619
has a list view in it which represents
the the chat content so far and then at

00:13:49.619 --> 00:13:49.629
the the chat content so far and then at
 

00:13:49.629 --> 00:13:52.350
the the chat content so far and then at
the bottom of it has a edit text well

00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:52.360
the bottom of it has a edit text well
 

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:54.749
the bottom of it has a edit text well
you can actually take a view out from

00:13:54.749 --> 00:13:54.759
you can actually take a view out from
 

00:13:54.759 --> 00:13:56.850
you can actually take a view out from
the bottom or create a new view on the

00:13:56.850 --> 00:13:56.860
the bottom or create a new view on the
 

00:13:56.860 --> 00:13:58.859
the bottom or create a new view on the
fly and place that directly into the

00:13:58.859 --> 00:13:58.869
fly and place that directly into the
 

00:13:58.869 --> 00:14:03.269
fly and place that directly into the
frame layout so you could set let's see

00:14:03.269 --> 00:14:03.279
frame layout so you could set let's see
 

00:14:03.279 --> 00:14:05.069
frame layout so you could set let's see
yeah right you're taking it out of its

00:14:05.069 --> 00:14:05.079
yeah right you're taking it out of its
 

00:14:05.079 --> 00:14:07.139
yeah right you're taking it out of its
out of its container at the bottom and

00:14:07.139 --> 00:14:07.149
out of its container at the bottom and
 

00:14:07.149 --> 00:14:08.669
out of its container at the bottom and
then you're putting it into the overall

00:14:08.669 --> 00:14:08.679
then you're putting it into the overall
 

00:14:08.679 --> 00:14:10.199
then you're putting it into the overall
container that also contains the list

00:14:10.199 --> 00:14:10.209
container that also contains the list
 

00:14:10.209 --> 00:14:12.780
container that also contains the list
view and then as that container draws it

00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:12.790
view and then as that container draws it
 

00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:14.549
view and then as that container draws it
can then draw that other child there

00:14:14.549 --> 00:14:14.559
can then draw that other child there
 

00:14:14.559 --> 00:14:16.799
can then draw that other child there
right so you're adding it as a child

00:14:16.799 --> 00:14:16.809
right so you're adding it as a child
 

00:14:16.809 --> 00:14:19.169
right so you're adding it as a child
basically on the top layer of some

00:14:19.169 --> 00:14:19.179
basically on the top layer of some
 

00:14:19.179 --> 00:14:21.179
basically on the top layer of some
layout that's at the back you know maybe

00:14:21.179 --> 00:14:21.189
layout that's at the back you know maybe
 

00:14:21.189 --> 00:14:23.340
layout that's at the back you know maybe
your main content view or whatever and

00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:23.350
your main content view or whatever and
 

00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:24.569
your main content view or whatever and
then you can do whatever you want you

00:14:24.569 --> 00:14:24.579
then you can do whatever you want you
 

00:14:24.579 --> 00:14:25.979
then you can do whatever you want you
can animate the bounds of that thing you

00:14:25.979 --> 00:14:25.989
can animate the bounds of that thing you
 

00:14:25.989 --> 00:14:27.629
can animate the bounds of that thing you
can animate the translation position or

00:14:27.629 --> 00:14:27.639
can animate the translation position or
 

00:14:27.639 --> 00:14:29.249
can animate the translation position or
whatever you can scale it on the fly

00:14:29.249 --> 00:14:29.259
whatever you can scale it on the fly
 

00:14:29.259 --> 00:14:31.049
whatever you can scale it on the fly
then you could do CrossFit tricks like

00:14:31.049 --> 00:14:31.059
then you could do CrossFit tricks like
 

00:14:31.059 --> 00:14:34.979
then you could do CrossFit tricks like
once once it's in that that layout that

00:14:34.979 --> 00:14:34.989
once once it's in that that layout that
 

00:14:34.989 --> 00:14:36.449
once once it's in that that layout that
allows it to lie on top of everything

00:14:36.449 --> 00:14:36.459
allows it to lie on top of everything
 

00:14:36.459 --> 00:14:37.859
allows it to lie on top of everything
else that's in there you can do whatever

00:14:37.859 --> 00:14:37.869
else that's in there you can do whatever
 

00:14:37.869 --> 00:14:39.749
else that's in there you can do whatever
you want with it and then place it in

00:14:39.749 --> 00:14:39.759
you want with it and then place it in
 

00:14:39.759 --> 00:14:41.699
you want with it and then place it in
the correct place the real trick there

00:14:41.699 --> 00:14:41.709
the correct place the real trick there
 

00:14:41.709 --> 00:14:43.829
the correct place the real trick there
though is as I said at the beginning of

00:14:43.829 --> 00:14:43.839
though is as I said at the beginning of
 

00:14:43.839 --> 00:14:47.009

this incredibly long paragraph figuring

00:14:47.009 --> 00:14:47.019
this incredibly long paragraph figuring

this incredibly long paragraph figuring
out a view that's going to correctly

00:14:49.079 --> 00:14:49.089
out a view that's going to correctly
 

00:14:49.089 --> 00:14:50.850
out a view that's going to correctly
represent that view from the starting

00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:50.860
represent that view from the starting
 

00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:53.819
represent that view from the starting
position and location and size and the

00:14:53.819 --> 00:14:53.829
position and location and size and the
 

00:14:53.829 --> 00:14:54.740
position and location and size and the
same thing at the end

00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:54.750
same thing at the end
 

00:14:54.750 --> 00:14:56.810
same thing at the end
so that to the user it actually looks

00:14:56.810 --> 00:14:56.820
so that to the user it actually looks
 

00:14:56.820 --> 00:14:58.160
so that to the user it actually looks
like the same object even though it

00:14:58.160 --> 00:14:58.170
like the same object even though it
 

00:14:58.170 --> 00:15:00.710
like the same object even though it
probably is not the same object sounds

00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:00.720
probably is not the same object sounds
 

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:02.750
probably is not the same object sounds
like a lot of sneakiness there is a lot

00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:02.760
like a lot of sneakiness there is a lot
 

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:04.370
like a lot of sneakiness there is a lot

may have answered in that very long
paragraph so let's say you've got a chat

00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:20.190
paragraph so let's say you've got a chat
 

00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:21.740
paragraph so let's say you've got a chat
client and when the chat loads you see

00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:21.750
client and when the chat loads you see
 

00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:24.500
client and when the chat loads you see
the see the top of the list to begin

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:24.510
the see the top of the list to begin
 

00:15:24.510 --> 00:15:27.800
the see the top of the list to begin
with so the least recent messages for a

00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:27.810
with so the least recent messages for a
 

00:15:27.810 --> 00:15:29.330
with so the least recent messages for a
moment and it jumps down to the bottom

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:29.340
moment and it jumps down to the bottom
 

00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:31.580
moment and it jumps down to the bottom
is there a way to avoid that when you

00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:31.590
is there a way to avoid that when you
 

00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:33.470
is there a way to avoid that when you
sort of you know displaying that chat

00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:33.480
sort of you know displaying that chat
 

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:35.720
sort of you know displaying that chat
list to begin with so if you sort of you

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:35.730
list to begin with so if you sort of you
 

00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:37.280
list to begin with so if you sort of you
open up the window and it's got the the

00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:37.290
open up the window and it's got the the
 

00:15:37.290 --> 00:15:38.750
open up the window and it's got the the
list and then you want to scroll to the

00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:38.760
list and then you want to scroll to the
 

00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:41.150
list and then you want to scroll to the
bottom straightaway when the activity is

00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:41.160
bottom straightaway when the activity is
 

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:45.080
bottom straightaway when the activity is
loaded yes so one of the tricks that's

00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:45.090
loaded yes so one of the tricks that's
 

00:15:45.090 --> 00:15:47.560
loaded yes so one of the tricks that's
if you go back and watch the i/o talk

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:47.570
if you go back and watch the i/o talk
 

00:15:47.570 --> 00:15:50.660
if you go back and watch the i/o talk
called a moving experience where we did

00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:50.670
called a moving experience where we did
 

00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:53.180
called a moving experience where we did
a lot of animation demos a particular

00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:53.190
a lot of animation demos a particular
 

00:15:53.190 --> 00:15:57.050
a lot of animation demos a particular
trick or if I were to be more proper i

00:15:57.050 --> 00:15:57.060
trick or if I were to be more proper i
 

00:15:57.060 --> 00:16:00.020
trick or if I were to be more proper i
would say technique that you saw in

00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:00.030
would say technique that you saw in
 

00:16:00.030 --> 00:16:01.310
would say technique that you saw in
almost every one of the demos that we

00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:01.320
almost every one of the demos that we
 

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:04.550
almost every one of the demos that we
showed was using pre draw listeners and

00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:04.560
showed was using pre draw listeners and
 

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:05.960
showed was using pre draw listeners and
you can use this when an activity to

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:05.970
you can use this when an activity to
 

00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:07.910
you can use this when an activity to
launch is basically to let when an

00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:07.920
launch is basically to let when an
 

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:09.290
launch is basically to let when an
activity launches we're going to do

00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:09.300
activity launches we're going to do
 

00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:11.060
activity launches we're going to do
everything we need to including layout

00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:11.070
everything we need to including layout
 

00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:12.620
everything we need to including layout
and figure out where things are loading

00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:12.630
and figure out where things are loading
 

00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:13.730
and figure out where things are loading
the resources and getting everything

00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:13.740
the resources and getting everything
 

00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:15.260
the resources and getting everything
ready and then we're going to draw the

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:15.270
ready and then we're going to draw the
 

00:16:15.270 --> 00:16:17.240
ready and then we're going to draw the
activity right and when we draw that

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:17.250
activity right and when we draw that
 

00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:19.190
activity right and when we draw that
activity by definition everything will

00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:19.200
activity by definition everything will
 

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:20.780
activity by definition everything will
be correctly positioned the way there

00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:20.790
be correctly positioned the way there
 

00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:24.860
be correctly positioned the way there
needs to be in your case the way that it

00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:24.870
needs to be in your case the way that it
 

00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:26.660
needs to be in your case the way that it
needs to be might be you know with

00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:26.670
needs to be might be you know with
 

00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:28.370
needs to be might be you know with
content actually moved up you know

00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:28.380
content actually moved up you know
 

00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:31.340
content actually moved up you know
animated up or whatever and so what you

00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:31.350
animated up or whatever and so what you
 

00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:33.140
animated up or whatever and so what you
can do is set a pre draw listener so

00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:33.150
can do is set a pre draw listener so
 

00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:34.970
can do is set a pre draw listener so
that right before we actually draw the

00:16:34.970 --> 00:16:34.980
that right before we actually draw the
 

00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:36.770
that right before we actually draw the
frame you can go in and change some

frame you can go in and change some
 

00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:39.020
frame you can go in and change some
values so that what we draw is going to

00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:39.030

maybe there's a better more correct way

00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:44.910
maybe there's a better more correct way
 

00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:46.940
maybe there's a better more correct way
to do this with you know layouts to

00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:46.950
to do this with you know layouts to
 

00:16:46.950 --> 00:16:48.440
to do this with you know layouts to
actually do this correctly but but

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:48.450
actually do this correctly but but
 

00:16:48.450 --> 00:16:50.900
actually do this correctly but but
there's an underlying question here

00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:50.910
there's an underlying question here
 

00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:53.300
there's an underlying question here
which is when is the first time that I

00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:53.310
which is when is the first time that I
 

00:16:53.310 --> 00:16:55.820
which is when is the first time that I
can actually get my hands on the bits

00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:55.830
can actually get my hands on the bits
 

00:16:55.830 --> 00:16:57.079
can actually get my hands on the bits
that are going to display on the screen

00:16:57.079 --> 00:16:57.089
that are going to display on the screen
 

00:16:57.089 --> 00:16:59.750
that are going to display on the screen
and it's that pre draw listener right so

00:16:59.750 --> 00:16:59.760
and it's that pre draw listener right so
 

00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:02.030
and it's that pre draw listener right so
you basically get the view tree observer

00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:02.040
you basically get the view tree observer
 

00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:03.310
you basically get the view tree observer
for any view in the hierarchy

00:17:03.310 --> 00:17:03.320
for any view in the hierarchy
 

00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:05.800
for any view in the hierarchy
a add a non pre-drawn listener put your

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:05.810
a add a non pre-drawn listener put your
 

00:17:05.810 --> 00:17:06.939
a add a non pre-drawn listener put your
code in there that's going to do

00:17:06.939 --> 00:17:06.949
code in there that's going to do
 

00:17:06.949 --> 00:17:08.949
code in there that's going to do
whatever it is start in animation move

00:17:08.949 --> 00:17:08.959

there and then remember to return true
from that so that the draw actually

00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:14.930
from that so that the draw actually
 

00:17:14.930 --> 00:17:16.960
from that so that the draw actually
happens little nuance have used an ID

your pre dry listener you are cancelling

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:25.490
your pre dry listener you are cancelling

your pre dry listener you are cancelling
the draw don't do that helpful so what

00:17:28.329 --> 00:17:28.339
the draw don't do that helpful so what
 

00:17:28.339 --> 00:17:29.560
the draw don't do that helpful so what
do you actually get back from the

00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:29.570
do you actually get back from the
 

00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:31.150
do you actually get back from the
pre-drilled listener so at that point do

00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:31.160
pre-drilled listener so at that point do
 

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:33.130
pre-drilled listener so at that point do
you have access to the inflated layout

00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:33.140

we showed in that talk at i/o consisted
 

00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:03.370
we showed in that talk at i/o consisted
of figuring out where things needed to

at that time all right so it's a way
sort of preset thing so if you know this

00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:25.730
sort of preset thing so if you know this
 

00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:27.640
sort of preset thing so if you know this
is what you've got there is the right

is what you've got there is the right
 

00:18:27.650 --> 00:18:29.020
is what you've got there is the right
place for them and you can say actually

you pre candid in the reverse direction

00:18:36.490 --> 00:18:36.500
you pre candid in the reverse direction
 

00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:38.440
you pre candid in the reverse direction
right now there's I mean there's there's

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:38.450
right now there's I mean there's there's
 

00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:40.090
right now there's I mean there's there's
a related question that I don't really

00:18:40.090 --> 00:18:40.100
a related question that I don't really
 

00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:41.500
a related question that I don't really
know how to answer which is well maybe

00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:41.510
know how to answer which is well maybe
 

00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:43.150
know how to answer which is well maybe
the correct thing for you to do actually

00:18:43.150 --> 00:18:43.160
the correct thing for you to do actually
 

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:44.610
the correct thing for you to do actually
lay things out differently and

00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:44.620
lay things out differently and
 

00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:47.350
lay things out differently and
reposition them that catching the on pre

draw and sort of setting things up for
 

00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:50.470
draw and sort of setting things up for
animations is slightly different happier

00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:50.480
animations is slightly different happier
 

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:52.240
animations is slightly different happier
solution where you're not actually

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:52.250
solution where you're not actually
 

00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:53.800
solution where you're not actually
setting the correct position of these

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:53.810
setting the correct position of these
 

00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:55.630
setting the correct position of these
things which would require actually

00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:55.640
things which would require actually
 

00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:58.000
things which would require actually
setting layout params and doing a

00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:58.010
setting layout params and doing a
 

00:18:58.010 --> 00:18:59.740
setting layout params and doing a
request layout and we've already done

00:18:59.740 --> 00:18:59.750
request layout and we've already done
 

00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:01.690
request layout and we've already done
the first layout right so it's a little

00:19:01.690 --> 00:19:01.700
the first layout right so it's a little
 

00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:03.460
the first layout right so it's a little
bit late for you to then come in and say

00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:03.470
bit late for you to then come in and say
 

00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:05.110
bit late for you to then come in and say
ok now at this time I'd like to do this

00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:05.120
ok now at this time I'd like to do this
 

00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:06.790
ok now at this time I'd like to do this
other thing for that logic you'd

00:19:06.790 --> 00:19:06.800
other thing for that logic you'd
 

00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:08.020
other thing for that logic you'd
actually want to do that a little bit

00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:08.030
actually want to do that a little bit
 

00:19:08.030 --> 00:19:09.180
actually want to do that a little bit
earlier maybe in

00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:09.190
earlier maybe in
 

00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:12.830
earlier maybe in
on activity created on created on create

00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:12.840
on activity created on created on create
 

00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:15.510
on activity created on created on create
on and on we have a lot of on methods

00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:15.520
on and on we have a lot of on methods
 

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:18.060
on and on we have a lot of on methods
sure we do and at that point you can

00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:18.070
sure we do and at that point you can
 

00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:19.890
sure we do and at that point you can
sort of set up the layout for what you

00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:19.900
sort of set up the layout for what you
 

00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:22.230
sort of set up the layout for what you
need to be and that will generate a

00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:22.240
need to be and that will generate a
 

00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:24.270
need to be and that will generate a
request layout and that'll put things in

00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:24.280
request layout and that'll put things in
 

00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:27.000
request layout and that'll put things in
the correct layout position and maybe

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:27.010
the correct layout position and maybe
 

00:19:27.010 --> 00:19:28.470
the correct layout position and maybe
then you don't even need the on pre draw

00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:28.480
then you don't even need the on pre draw
 

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:31.320
then you don't even need the on pre draw
listener but the the on pre draw is a

00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:31.330
listener but the the on pre draw is a
 

00:19:31.330 --> 00:19:32.580
listener but the the on pre draw is a
nice trick when you actually need to

00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:32.590
nice trick when you actually need to
 

00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:34.590
nice trick when you actually need to
figure out let the system do the real

00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:34.600
figure out let the system do the real
 

00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:36.150
figure out let the system do the real
thing and then tell me what's going on

00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:36.160
thing and then tell me what's going on
 

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:37.800
thing and then tell me what's going on
before you put it on the screen so it

00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:37.810
before you put it on the screen so it
 

00:19:37.810 --> 00:19:39.150
before you put it on the screen so it
sounds like it's almost a case of

00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:39.160
sounds like it's almost a case of
 

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:40.590
sounds like it's almost a case of
figuring out what the most common

00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:40.600
figuring out what the most common
 

00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:42.270
figuring out what the most common
scenario is so if you do it every time

00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:42.280
scenario is so if you do it every time
 

00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:44.460
scenario is so if you do it every time
then hacking into the reader or listener

00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:44.470
then hacking into the reader or listener
 

00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:46.110
then hacking into the reader or listener
is probably overkill you should probably

00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:46.120
is probably overkill you should probably
 

00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:48.840
is probably overkill you should probably
just do it in the layout somehow whereas

00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:48.850
just do it in the layout somehow whereas
 

00:19:48.850 --> 00:19:50.550
just do it in the layout somehow whereas
if it's a sort of a one-off or something

00:19:50.550 --> 00:19:50.560
if it's a sort of a one-off or something
 

00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:52.710
if it's a sort of a one-off or something
unusual than it might maybe a better

00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:52.720
unusual than it might maybe a better
 

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:55.440
unusual than it might maybe a better
approach I would say more that if you're

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:55.450
approach I would say more that if you're
 

00:19:55.450 --> 00:19:57.720
approach I would say more that if you're
going to start hacking things and faking

00:19:57.720 --> 00:19:57.730
going to start hacking things and faking
 

00:19:57.730 --> 00:20:00.900
going to start hacking things and faking
out layout that you may end up causing

00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:00.910
out layout that you may end up causing
 

00:20:00.910 --> 00:20:02.580
out layout that you may end up causing
artifacts like if you say no no that's

00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:02.590
artifacts like if you say no no that's
 

00:20:02.590 --> 00:20:03.930
artifacts like if you say no no that's
not where I wanted it to be and then you

00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:03.940
not where I wanted it to be and then you
 

00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:05.640
not where I wanted it to be and then you
go ahead and you set the left right top

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:05.650
go ahead and you set the left right top
 

00:20:05.650 --> 00:20:08.010
go ahead and you set the left right top
bottom position regardless of what lay

00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:08.020
bottom position regardless of what lay
 

00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:09.870
bottom position regardless of what lay
out where layout wanted to place those

00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:09.880
out where layout wanted to place those
 

00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:12.600
out where layout wanted to place those
items then if another layout happens to

00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:12.610
items then if another layout happens to
 

00:20:12.610 --> 00:20:14.250
items then if another layout happens to
run in the next frame your positions

00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:14.260
run in the next frame your positions
 

00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:16.290
run in the next frame your positions
will get clobbered by the real way up so

00:20:16.290 --> 00:20:16.300
will get clobbered by the real way up so
 

00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:18.030
will get clobbered by the real way up so
if you actually want to lay out these

00:20:18.030 --> 00:20:18.040
if you actually want to lay out these
 

00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:19.560
if you actually want to lay out these
things at the right place then figure

00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:19.570
things at the right place then figure
 

00:20:19.570 --> 00:20:21.630
things at the right place then figure
out the right layout solution as opposed

00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:21.640
out the right layout solution as opposed
 

00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:23.760
out the right layout solution as opposed
to the more you know animated sliding

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:23.770
to the more you know animated sliding
 

00:20:23.770 --> 00:20:26.100
to the more you know animated sliding
things in situations right so avoid go

00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:26.110
things in situations right so avoid go
 

00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:29.220

you learn something every day somewhere

00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:33.190
you learn something every day somewhere
 

00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:36.300
you learn something every day somewhere
ok so this next question the it's about

00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:36.310
ok so this next question the it's about
 

00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:37.980
ok so this next question the it's about
as long a paragraph is your earlier why

as long a paragraph is your earlier why
so bear with me well I uh I find the

00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:40.690
so bear with me well I uh I find the
 

00:20:40.690 --> 00:20:43.140
so bear with me well I uh I find the

as I read it through so we've got

00:20:46.410 --> 00:20:46.420
as I read it through so we've got
 

00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:47.790
as I read it through so we've got
someone who's working on an app so this

00:20:47.790 --> 00:20:47.800
someone who's working on an app so this
 

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:49.830
someone who's working on an app so this
is sorry this is a farms dorfman he's

00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:49.840
is sorry this is a farms dorfman he's
 

00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:51.690
is sorry this is a farms dorfman he's
working on an app which is a great start

00:20:51.690 --> 00:20:51.700
working on an app which is a great start
 

00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:54.360
working on an app which is a great start
really important for us it's going to

00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:54.370
really important for us it's going to
 

00:20:54.370 --> 00:20:57.450
really important for us it's going to
animate a box so some kind let's say to

00:20:57.450 --> 00:20:57.460
animate a box so some kind let's say to
 

00:20:57.460 --> 00:20:59.370
animate a box so some kind let's say to
a custom action bus or box along the top

00:20:59.370 --> 00:20:59.380
a custom action bus or box along the top
 

00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:03.780
a custom action bus or box along the top
of your activity in and out while you're

00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:03.790
of your activity in and out while you're
 

00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:05.670
of your activity in and out while you're
scrolling so like the google chrome app

00:21:05.670 --> 00:21:05.680
scrolling so like the google chrome app
 

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:07.560
scrolling so like the google chrome app
does with the URL box so as you scroll

00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:07.570
does with the URL box so as you scroll
 

00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:09.030
does with the URL box so as you scroll
is going to make this box appear and

00:21:09.030 --> 00:21:09.040
is going to make this box appear and
 

00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:13.200
is going to make this box appear and
disappear but the scroll animation

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:13.210
disappear but the scroll animation
 

00:21:13.210 --> 00:21:16.050
disappear but the scroll animation
contains some kind of sub animations so

00:21:16.050 --> 00:21:16.060
contains some kind of sub animations so
 

00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:18.690
contains some kind of sub animations so
his action bar should change its height

00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:18.700
his action bar should change its height
 

00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:21.000
his action bar should change its height
on scrolling and also do some dish

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:21.010
on scrolling and also do some dish
 

00:21:21.010 --> 00:21:23.070
on scrolling and also do some dish
animations with the child views like

00:21:23.070 --> 00:21:23.080
animations with the child views like
 

00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:25.590
animations with the child views like
icons and text views so the first

00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:25.600
icons and text views so the first
 

00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:27.630
icons and text views so the first
question is how does he implements a

00:21:27.630 --> 00:21:27.640
question is how does he implements a
 

00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:30.000
question is how does he implements a
change animation is that a scale

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:30.010
change animation is that a scale
 

00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:31.980
change animation is that a scale
animation it doesn't seem to be

00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:31.990
animation it doesn't seem to be
 

00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:36.330
animation it doesn't seem to be
something like that yeah changing the

00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:36.340
something like that yeah changing the
 

00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:40.860
something like that yeah changing the
bounds of views can be tricky because

00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:40.870
bounds of views can be tricky because
 

00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:44.370
bounds of views can be tricky because
the height the bounds of objects as well

00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:44.380
the height the bounds of objects as well
 

00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:45.750
the height the bounds of objects as well
as the real positions of them are

00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:45.760
as the real positions of them are
 

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:48.480
as the real positions of them are
determined by the layout and to get the

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:48.490
determined by the layout and to get the
 

00:21:48.490 --> 00:21:52.560
determined by the layout and to get the
real to get or to set the real position

00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:52.570
real to get or to set the real position
 

00:21:52.570 --> 00:21:55.170
real to get or to set the real position
and dimensions of a view you really need

00:21:55.170 --> 00:21:55.180
and dimensions of a view you really need
 

00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:56.730
and dimensions of a view you really need
to let layout run because only the

00:21:56.730 --> 00:21:56.740
to let layout run because only the
 

00:21:56.740 --> 00:21:58.920
to let layout run because only the
layout especially the nested layout in

00:21:58.920 --> 00:21:58.930
layout especially the nested layout in
 

00:21:58.930 --> 00:22:00.690
layout especially the nested layout in
which that view lives is going to be

00:22:00.690 --> 00:22:00.700
which that view lives is going to be
 

00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:02.460
which that view lives is going to be
able to determine the real information

00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:02.470
able to determine the real information
 

00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:04.320
able to determine the real information
about that view so I would say in an

00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:04.330
about that view so I would say in an
 

00:22:04.330 --> 00:22:08.370
about that view so I would say in an
ideal world if you want to set the size

00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:08.380
ideal world if you want to set the size
 

00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:10.140
ideal world if you want to set the size
of an object or animate the size of

00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:10.150
of an object or animate the size of
 

00:22:10.150 --> 00:22:11.670
of an object or animate the size of
object what you do is change the layout

00:22:11.670 --> 00:22:11.680
object what you do is change the layout
 

00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:13.620
object what you do is change the layout
params and then let the layout system

00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:13.630
params and then let the layout system
 

00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:15.810
params and then let the layout system
figure it out in the real world in which

00:22:15.810 --> 00:22:15.820
figure it out in the real world in which
 

00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:18.480
figure it out in the real world in which
we live I have constrained devices that

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:18.490
we live I have constrained devices that
 

00:22:18.490 --> 00:22:20.550
we live I have constrained devices that
might just fall over if you force them

00:22:20.550 --> 00:22:20.560
might just fall over if you force them
 

00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:22.380
might just fall over if you force them
to do layout on every frame in a really

00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:22.390
to do layout on every frame in a really
 

00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:23.970
to do layout on every frame in a really
complex view higher again and in fact

00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:23.980
complex view higher again and in fact
 

00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:25.860
complex view higher again and in fact
that easy follow up is he was like kind

00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:25.870
that easy follow up is he was like kind
 

00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:27.270
that easy follow up is he was like kind
of how to do this going to change the

00:22:27.270 --> 00:22:27.280
of how to do this going to change the
 

00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:30.000
of how to do this going to change the
layout parameters is was a following

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:30.010
layout parameters is was a following
 

00:22:30.010 --> 00:22:31.890
layout parameters is was a following
this was the follow up it turns out that

00:22:31.890 --> 00:22:31.900
this was the follow up it turns out that
 

00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:33.750
this was the follow up it turns out that
this has some performance ability does

00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:33.760
this has some performance ability does
 

00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:35.520
this has some performance ability does
her performance fact I know this i am

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:35.530
her performance fact I know this i am
 

00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:37.470
her performance fact I know this i am
even even back in the days where we

00:22:37.470 --> 00:22:37.480
even even back in the days where we
 

00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:38.940
even even back in the days where we
didn't have such resource constrained

00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:38.950
didn't have such resource constrained

this really smooth progress bar so it

00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:50.950
this really smooth progress bar so it
 

00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:52.050
this really smooth progress bar so it
was a progress bar battles in

00:22:52.050 --> 00:22:52.060
was a progress bar battles in
 

00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:53.970
was a progress bar battles in
determinants and i have a passionate

determinants and i have a passionate
 

00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:56.250
determinants and i have a passionate
hatred for progress bars which go to the

00:22:56.250 --> 00:22:56.260
hatred for progress bars which go to the
 

00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:57.840
hatred for progress bars which go to the
end and then start again from the

and a pulsed went in and out and and it
and it changed colors and everything

00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:03.850
and it changed colors and everything
 

00:23:03.850 --> 00:23:05.040
and it changed colors and everything
because you could do that in the.net

00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:05.050
because you could do that in the.net
 

00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:07.590
because you could do that in the.net
canvas and so I was changing the the

00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:07.600
canvas and so I was changing the the
 

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:09.990
canvas and so I was changing the the
layout of this object which was changing

00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:10.000
layout of this object which was changing
 

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.620
layout of this object which was changing
colors turns out it uh well no it was

00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:13.630
colors turns out it uh well no it was
 

00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:15.450
colors turns out it uh well no it was
beautiful for because I just took over

00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:15.460
beautiful for because I just took over
 

00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:17.250
beautiful for because I just took over
the UI thread for that is you want to

00:23:17.250 --> 00:23:17.260
the UI thread for that is you want to
 

00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:18.960
the UI thread for that is you want to
make it nice and smooth it turns out it

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:18.970
make it nice and smooth it turns out it
 

00:23:18.970 --> 00:23:20.400
make it nice and smooth it turns out it
decreased the performance of the

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:20.410
decreased the performance of the
 

00:23:20.410 --> 00:23:24.450
decreased the performance of the
underlying activity by a factor of 10 so

00:23:24.450 --> 00:23:24.460
underlying activity by a factor of 10 so
 

00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:26.400
underlying activity by a factor of 10 so
nations are that important well and I

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:26.410
nations are that important well and I
 

00:23:26.410 --> 00:23:28.590
nations are that important well and I
for me that was good enough that cuz it

00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:28.600
for me that was good enough that cuz it
 

00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:30.980
for me that was good enough that cuz it
looks good it's good enough that's right

00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:30.990
looks good it's good enough that's right
 

00:23:30.990 --> 00:23:33.530
looks good it's good enough that's right
so yes that was his follow-up so do you

00:23:33.530 --> 00:23:33.540
so yes that was his follow-up so do you
 

00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:36.380
so yes that was his follow-up so do you
have any general ideas feedback then

00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:36.390
have any general ideas feedback then
 

00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:39.440
have any general ideas feedback then
yeah I again most my answers are well

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:39.450
yeah I again most my answers are well
 

00:23:39.450 --> 00:23:42.200
yeah I again most my answers are well
depends on your situation in this

00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:42.210
depends on your situation in this
 

00:23:42.210 --> 00:23:43.790
depends on your situation in this
particular case there's a couple of

00:23:43.790 --> 00:23:43.800
particular case there's a couple of
 

00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:45.970
particular case there's a couple of
things that could work you've also

00:23:45.970 --> 00:23:45.980
things that could work you've also
 

00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:48.080
things that could work you've also
determine that maybe scale is not the

00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:48.090
determine that maybe scale is not the
 

00:23:48.090 --> 00:23:50.540
determine that maybe scale is not the
answer and in general it's not scale is

00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:50.550
answer and in general it's not scale is
 

00:23:50.550 --> 00:23:51.950
answer and in general it's not scale is
really nice for sort of a transient

00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:51.960
really nice for sort of a transient
 

00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:53.210
really nice for sort of a transient
effect where you're popping something

00:23:53.210 --> 00:23:53.220
effect where you're popping something
 

00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:55.250
effect where you're popping something
out of the screen or you're animating it

00:23:55.250 --> 00:23:55.260
out of the screen or you're animating it
 

00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:56.720
out of the screen or you're animating it
in or you're just giving a little bounce

00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:56.730
in or you're just giving a little bounce
 

00:23:56.730 --> 00:23:58.100
in or you're just giving a little bounce
in fact or whatever but as soon as you

00:23:58.100 --> 00:23:58.110
in fact or whatever but as soon as you
 

00:23:58.110 --> 00:24:00.020
in fact or whatever but as soon as you
start scaling things especially the

00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:00.030
start scaling things especially the
 

00:24:00.030 --> 00:24:02.419
start scaling things especially the
contain text they tend to look really

00:24:02.419 --> 00:24:02.429
contain text they tend to look really
 

00:24:02.429 --> 00:24:04.700
contain text they tend to look really
awful so it's really better as a

00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:04.710
awful so it's really better as a
 

00:24:04.710 --> 00:24:06.680
awful so it's really better as a
temporary effect then to actually change

00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:06.690
temporary effect then to actually change
 

00:24:06.690 --> 00:24:09.290
temporary effect then to actually change
this size with a scale especially you

00:24:09.290 --> 00:24:09.300
this size with a scale especially you
 

00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:10.130
this size with a scale especially you
know you're going to make this thing

00:24:10.130 --> 00:24:10.140
know you're going to make this thing
 

00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:11.990
know you're going to make this thing
taller so you're going to scale and why

00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:12.000
taller so you're going to scale and why
 

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:13.430
taller so you're going to scale and why
well that's just going to stretch out

00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:13.440
well that's just going to stretch out
 

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:14.570
well that's just going to stretch out
everything vertically it's going to

00:24:14.570 --> 00:24:14.580
everything vertically it's going to
 

00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:17.900
everything vertically it's going to
really look horrible it's a graphics

00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:17.910
really look horrible it's a graphics
 

00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:21.350
really look horrible it's a graphics
term horror horrible so what you really

00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:21.360
term horror horrible so what you really
 

00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:23.090
term horror horrible so what you really
want to do is change the real bounds of

00:24:23.090 --> 00:24:23.100
want to do is change the real bounds of
 

00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:24.770
want to do is change the real bounds of
the object but then you have this this

00:24:24.770 --> 00:24:24.780
the object but then you have this this
 

00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:27.020
the object but then you have this this
problem to solve where well if you

00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:27.030
problem to solve where well if you
 

00:24:27.030 --> 00:24:29.210
problem to solve where well if you
animate the layout brims that's really

00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:29.220
animate the layout brims that's really
 

00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:30.980
animate the layout brims that's really
expensive it's the correct solution but

00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:30.990
expensive it's the correct solution but
 

00:24:30.990 --> 00:24:33.410
expensive it's the correct solution but
it's really expensive what I have done

00:24:33.410 --> 00:24:33.420
it's really expensive what I have done
 

00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:36.020
it's really expensive what I have done
in some situations including the layout

00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:36.030
in some situations including the layout
 

00:24:36.030 --> 00:24:37.190
in some situations including the layout
transition class that we talked about

00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:37.200
transition class that we talked about
 

00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:40.040
transition class that we talked about
earlier is you can actually animate the

00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:40.050
earlier is you can actually animate the
 

00:24:40.050 --> 00:24:41.830
earlier is you can actually animate the
bounds of an object and you can do that

00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:41.840
bounds of an object and you can do that
 

00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:45.500
bounds of an object and you can do that
by calling centers where you can set up

00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:45.510
by calling centers where you can set up
 

00:24:45.510 --> 00:24:47.240
by calling centers where you can set up
an object animator to basically animate

00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:47.250
an object animator to basically animate
 

00:24:47.250 --> 00:24:48.740
an object animator to basically animate
left right top bottom just as you can

00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:48.750
left right top bottom just as you can
 

00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:50.270
left right top bottom just as you can
animate the translation properties or

00:24:50.270 --> 00:24:50.280
animate the translation properties or
 

00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:51.620
animate the translation properties or
the scale or the rotation or anything

00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:51.630
the scale or the rotation or anything
 

00:24:51.630 --> 00:24:53.690
the scale or the rotation or anything
like that and you can combine that with

00:24:53.690 --> 00:24:53.700
like that and you can combine that with
 

00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:56.240
like that and you can combine that with
the ability to use the on pre draw

00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:56.250
the ability to use the on pre draw
 

00:24:56.250 --> 00:24:57.860
the ability to use the on pre draw
listener which we talked about earlier

00:24:57.860 --> 00:24:57.870
listener which we talked about earlier
 

00:24:57.870 --> 00:25:00.860
listener which we talked about earlier
to basically run layout set the layout

00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:00.870
to basically run layout set the layout
 

00:25:00.870 --> 00:25:03.950
to basically run layout set the layout
params to what you want them to be and

00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:03.960
params to what you want them to be and
 

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:05.870
params to what you want them to be and
that will cause a request layout and on

00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:05.880
that will cause a request layout and on
 

00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:07.549
that will cause a request layout and on
the next drawing frame we will run

00:25:07.549 --> 00:25:07.559
the next drawing frame we will run
 

00:25:07.559 --> 00:25:09.830
the next drawing frame we will run
layout before drawing occurs so if you

00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:09.840
layout before drawing occurs so if you
 

00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:11.600
layout before drawing occurs so if you
add a view tree observer on pre draw

00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:11.610
add a view tree observer on pre draw
 

00:25:11.610 --> 00:25:13.549
add a view tree observer on pre draw
Wisner then you're going to get a call

00:25:13.549 --> 00:25:13.559
Wisner then you're going to get a call
 

00:25:13.559 --> 00:25:15.440
Wisner then you're going to get a call
after that next layout has run but

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:15.450
after that next layout has run but
 

00:25:15.450 --> 00:25:17.180
after that next layout has run but
before we've displayed it on the screen

00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:17.190
before we've displayed it on the screen
 

00:25:17.190 --> 00:25:18.980
before we've displayed it on the screen
and at that point you can start an

00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:18.990
and at that point you can start an
 

00:25:18.990 --> 00:25:20.780
and at that point you can start an
animation this is exactly how layout

00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:20.790
animation this is exactly how layout
 

00:25:20.790 --> 00:25:22.640
animation this is exactly how layout
transition works you can start an

00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:22.650
transition works you can start an
 

00:25:22.650 --> 00:25:24.260
transition works you can start an
animation that animates the left right

00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:24.270
animation that animates the left right
 

00:25:24.270 --> 00:25:26.630
animation that animates the left right
top bottom bounds right and you can do

00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:26.640
top bottom bounds right and you can do
 

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:30.290
top bottom bounds right and you can do
so in a way that is is changing the

00:25:30.290 --> 00:25:30.300
so in a way that is is changing the
 

00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:31.850
so in a way that is is changing the
correct thing is not changing the scale

00:25:31.850 --> 00:25:31.860
correct thing is not changing the scale
 

00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:33.799
correct thing is not changing the scale
but instead it's actually changing the

00:25:33.799 --> 00:25:33.809
but instead it's actually changing the
 

00:25:33.809 --> 00:25:36.200
but instead it's actually changing the
size of the view now there's a couple of

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:36.210
size of the view now there's a couple of
 

00:25:36.210 --> 00:25:38.810
size of the view now there's a couple of
very important nuances to this one is

00:25:38.810 --> 00:25:38.820
very important nuances to this one is
 

00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:40.669
very important nuances to this one is
this the position

00:25:40.669 --> 00:25:40.679
this the position
 

00:25:40.679 --> 00:25:42.889
this the position
the position of items inside of that

00:25:42.889 --> 00:25:42.899
the position of items inside of that
 

00:25:42.899 --> 00:25:44.749
the position of items inside of that
view or inside of that layout whose

00:25:44.749 --> 00:25:44.759
view or inside of that layout whose
 

00:25:44.759 --> 00:25:46.700
view or inside of that layout whose
bounds here changing might be in the

00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:46.710
bounds here changing might be in the
 

00:25:46.710 --> 00:25:48.769
bounds here changing might be in the
wrong place because you just told layout

00:25:48.769 --> 00:25:48.779
wrong place because you just told layout
 

00:25:48.779 --> 00:25:51.200
wrong place because you just told layout
to run which means they may be set by

00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:51.210
to run which means they may be set by
 

00:25:51.210 --> 00:25:52.879
to run which means they may be set by
that layout to then pop to their end

00:25:52.879 --> 00:25:52.889
that layout to then pop to their end
 

00:25:52.889 --> 00:25:55.190
that layout to then pop to their end
state you may need to do something with

00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:55.200
state you may need to do something with
 

00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:57.919
state you may need to do something with
those such as animating their relative

00:25:57.919 --> 00:25:57.929
those such as animating their relative
 

00:25:57.929 --> 00:26:00.259
those such as animating their relative
position inside the layout at the same

00:26:00.259 --> 00:26:00.269
position inside the layout at the same
 

00:26:00.269 --> 00:26:02.269
position inside the layout at the same
time you can also do things like fade

00:26:02.269 --> 00:26:02.279
time you can also do things like fade
 

00:26:02.279 --> 00:26:04.430
time you can also do things like fade
text out resize the thing fade text in

00:26:04.430 --> 00:26:04.440
text out resize the thing fade text in
 

00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:08.830
text out resize the thing fade text in
that can be compelling or effective

00:26:08.830 --> 00:26:08.840
that can be compelling or effective
 

00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:11.029
that can be compelling or effective
another problem that you're going to run

00:26:11.029 --> 00:26:11.039
another problem that you're going to run
 

00:26:11.039 --> 00:26:14.330
another problem that you're going to run
into is that if a real layout runs in

00:26:14.330 --> 00:26:14.340
into is that if a real layout runs in
 

00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:17.210
into is that if a real layout runs in
the middle of your animation then you're

00:26:17.210 --> 00:26:17.220
the middle of your animation then you're
 

00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:20.269
the middle of your animation then you're
going to have a bad day because the real

00:26:20.269 --> 00:26:20.279
going to have a bad day because the real
 

00:26:20.279 --> 00:26:22.489
going to have a bad day because the real
layout positions are the ones that you

00:26:22.489 --> 00:26:22.499
layout positions are the ones that you
 

00:26:22.499 --> 00:26:24.409
layout positions are the ones that you
told it you wanted at the end of the

told it you wanted at the end of the
 

00:26:24.419 --> 00:26:26.690
told it you wanted at the end of the
animation so if you said okay I want

00:26:26.690 --> 00:26:26.700
animation so if you said okay I want
 

00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:28.310

mean you can use the on scroll listener

00:27:56.660 --> 00:27:56.670
mean you can use the on scroll listener
 

00:27:56.670 --> 00:27:58.670
mean you can use the on scroll listener
to detect scrolling and and then simply

00:27:58.670 --> 00:27:58.680
to detect scrolling and and then simply
 

00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:00.320
to detect scrolling and and then simply
set the translate y of the view to do

00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:00.330

yeah maybe copying that sprite was
really cheap but you are also copying a

00:31:29.270 --> 00:31:31.720
drawing the sprite it was like the 5th
or 6th level T and we simply ran out of

pixels on the screen great ok so here is

00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:37.790
pixels on the screen great ok so here is
 

00:31:37.790 --> 00:31:39.580
pixels on the screen great ok so here is
the the parallax view that is referring

00:31:39.580 --> 00:31:39.590

speed to yeah so the list underneath it
 

00:31:46.340 --> 00:31:49.000
speed to yeah so the list underneath it
ok so here's I guess the question is is

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:49.010
ok so here's I guess the question is is
 

00:31:49.010 --> 00:31:50.440
ok so here's I guess the question is is
this an animation or is this just a

00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:50.450
this an animation or is this just a
 

00:31:50.450 --> 00:31:52.360
this an animation or is this just a
simple case of you know we're tracking

00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:52.370
simple case of you know we're tracking
 

00:31:52.370 --> 00:31:54.960
simple case of you know we're tracking
the movement of this particular list and

00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:54.970
the movement of this particular list and
 

00:31:54.970 --> 00:31:57.549
the movement of this particular list and
modifying the position of each i believe

00:31:57.549 --> 00:31:57.559
modifying the position of each i believe
 

00:31:57.559 --> 00:31:58.990
modifying the position of each i believe
so that's not an animation they're just

00:31:58.990 --> 00:31:59.000
so that's not an animation they're just
 

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:00.730
so that's not an animation they're just
saying ok how far the finger move and

00:32:00.730 --> 00:32:00.740
saying ok how far the finger move and
 

00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:02.380
saying ok how far the finger move and
how far do we want to scroll this list

00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:02.390
how far do we want to scroll this list
 

00:32:02.390 --> 00:32:05.049
how far do we want to scroll this list
you can scroll a list either directly

00:32:05.049 --> 00:32:05.059
you can scroll a list either directly
 

00:32:05.059 --> 00:32:06.870
you can scroll a list either directly
with the finger or

00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:06.880
with the finger or
 

00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:08.250
with the finger or
grammatically I would assume that

layout and that view actually is down
there that will be its real position and

there that will be its real position and
 

00:34:15.850 --> 00:34:17.700
there that will be its real position and
that's where the layout wants to draw it

00:34:17.700 --> 00:34:17.710
that's where the layout wants to draw it
 

00:34:17.710 --> 00:34:19.649
that's where the layout wants to draw it
so as you animate the
