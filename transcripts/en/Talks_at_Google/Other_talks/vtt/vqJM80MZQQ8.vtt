00:00:01.479 --> 00:00:05.430
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.510
INTERVIEWER: So for anyone who's
not familiar with the

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:10.950
concept of family meal-- who
might just think it's a new

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.150
special at McDonald's--

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.210
can you tell us what
the definition is?

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.640
MICHAEL ROMANO: Well, the term
is used in restaurants.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.560
We don't call it "staff
meal," actually.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.120
I can't tell you where it
started or how it started, but

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.720
it's always referred to as
"family meal." Like, the chef

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.180
may ask the cook who's
responsible, OK, who's cooking

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:31.900
family today?

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.900
Or what do you got
for family today?

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.990
And of course, it goes deeper
than that, because we think of

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:39.650
it as a family.

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:45.250
And the very act of cooking this
food, and having everyone

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.410
sit down together and enjoy the
food, does create a sense

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.860
of family, which is why the book
has a wonderful synergy

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.140
with home cooking.

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.840
Because that's what you
do in your own home.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.980
INTERVIEWER: And do you feel
that the restaurant always has

00:00:58.980 --> 00:00:59.990
this notion of family?

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.130
Are there ever incidents in
which that's not the case?

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:05.310
I know in the book, there's a
famous cauliflower anecdote

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:06.095
when you were a stage.

00:01:06.095 --> 00:01:07.220
MICHAEL ROMANO: Oh, that
was not our restaurant.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.700
It was in Paris.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.280
Yeah, where a sous chef--
we were sitting

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.270
at the table eating.

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.260
And the sous chef put a bite of
cauliflower into his mouth

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:18.570
and spit it out.

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.690
And we immediately--

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:20.760
things got very quiet.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.690
And he asked who would
cook that food.

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.560
And a young apprentice from down
the other of the table

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:28.250
raised his hand.

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.380
And the sous chef motioned
him to come up.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.330
And when he got there,
he punched him.

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:34.710
INTERVIEWER: That's a
little bit shocking.

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.818
MICHAEL ROMANO: Yeah.

00:01:34.818 --> 00:01:37.180
They didn't have HR departments
in those days.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:38.940
INTERVIEWER: I'd assume not.

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.990
MICHAEL ROMANO: But
lesson learned.

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:42.710
INTERVIEWER: And so would you
say that's the craziest thing

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.400
that you've seen
at family meal?

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.590
MICHAEL ROMANO: Maybe--

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.470
in a negative way.

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.160
Many wonderful things
happen in terms of

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.330
the food that's created.

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.970
And sometimes family
meal is used--

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.450
there are special moments when
someone may be having a

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.080
birthday, or someone may be
leaving, or-- just as we saw

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.020
the other day--

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.080
at the Union Square Cafe, a
celebration of someone, in

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.360
this case, who had completed
25 years at the restaurant.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.160
DANNY MEYER: As the bartender.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.314
MICHAEL ROMANO: As
the bartender.

00:02:10.314 --> 00:02:11.590
INTERVIEWER: Wow.

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.290
MICHAEL ROMANO: So those
are occasions--

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.430
just as in a family, where you
want to do something a little

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:16.930
special and celebrate that.

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.080
DANNY MEYER: I also think that,
just as in a family,

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.270
it's not always smooth
sailing.

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:22.720
There are arguments.

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.250
Sometimes they are debates.

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.200
Sometimes they're
disagreements.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.400
But just because you're having
those kind of disagreements or

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:37.880
arguments, bringing them to a
table together actually, I

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.040
think, heightens the possibility
that something

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.600
good might come of it.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.170
And I'm very, very impressed.

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.380
We just got a tour of your
family table upstairs.

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.450
The difference is yours is so
large that not everyone is

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.830
eating together at the
exact same time.

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:00.030
But nonetheless, you're taking
time from your day to sit down

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.660
and be together.

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.420
And I think especially in a
world that you are doing more

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.770
than anyone to help to create,
where people spend time with a

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.340
device rather than face-to-face
with somebody

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.080
else, the table over which
conversation can be had with

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.160
food and drink is one of the
last places in our lives that

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.930
really bring human
beings together.

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.310
And we think they crave
it even more.

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.360
MICHAEL ROMANO: Right.

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.070
I guess eating is, and hopefully
will remain,

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:30.620
something you can't
do virtually.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.780
You have to actually sit down
and put food in your mouth.

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.220
DANNY MEYER: You know what-- one
thing I want to make sure

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.630
you guys do not invent at Google
is the notion that one

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.800
of these 3D printers can make a
steak medium rare and juicy.

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.180
As long as you don't do that,
we're in good shape.

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:45.120
INTERVIEWER: OK, fair enough.

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.960
I'll talk to the people
upstairs about that.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:50.390
And so I know that sometimes
becoming a family at a

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:51.760
restaurant is quite literal.

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.910
Danny, I know you met your
wife at a restaurant.

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.270
She was actually the
waitress there.

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:56.860
So is that what we're
all doing wrong?

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.440
Do we need to start working
front of house to find love?

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:00.910
How common is that?

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:02.120
DANNY MEYER: My bet is
it's happening right

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.830
under your nose here.

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:04.470
You just don't know about it.

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.600
But I'll never forget when Union
Square Cafe first opened

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.840
in 1985, a long time ago,
I couldn't find

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.350
the chef one night.

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.470
And I looked high and low--

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:17.700
it was before Michael
was there.

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.079
Michael was cooking at a French
restaurant at the time.

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:21.920
I looked in the kitchen.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:22.840
He wasn't there.

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.590
Looked at the dishwasher
station.

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:25.260
He wasn't there.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:26.490
Looked everywhere.

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.910
And finally, there was only one
door I hadn't opened, and

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:31.600
that was the walk-in
refrigerator in the basement.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.285
And there he was, making out
with the sous chef in front of

00:04:34.285 --> 00:04:37.130
the oyster bin.

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:40.680
And I said, oh boy, this is
going to be interesting.

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:41.760
And I called my dad.

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.020
And I said, what do I do?

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:45.970
I had never run a
business before.

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.120
And he said, you know, as far as
I'm concerned, restaurants

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.300
are a lot like families.

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.590
And he said, they're like
extended families.

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:55.610
And the number of intense
hours people are working

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:57.700
together, they're either going
to fight or they're going to

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:58.360
fall in love.

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.360
And as far as I'm concerned, you
got the better option of

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.780
the two here.

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.420
So we've had so many people
fall in love, have babies.

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:07.640
We could do a whole family
tree of all of our

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:08.520
restaurants.

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.490
We could probably start three
new restaurants just with the

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:12.345
offspring of people.

00:05:12.345 --> 00:05:13.690
INTERVIEWER: I was about to
say, a second generation--

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:15.340
you've got to bring them,
train them young.

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:16.500
DANNY MEYER: Absolutely.

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:17.760
MICHAEL ROMANO: That didn't
happen at the French

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.290
restaurant I was working at,
because there were no women

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:20.420
working there.

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:21.260
DANNY MEYER: That's
a good point.

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:22.410
It used to be thought that--

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:24.520
MICHAEL ROMANO: Well, I don't
know if it was a good point.

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:25.630
DANNY MEYER: It was
a bad point, but

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:28.520
you make a good point.

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:29.620
You see, it's like a family.

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:30.260
We--

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:31.000
MICHAEL ROMANO: Yeah.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.320
That was one of the great things
about coming to Union

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:36.350
Square Cafe from that
French restaurant.

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:38.870
It was a whole new world opening
up, and there were men

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:40.160
and women working in
the restaurant.

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.620
And it was a whole different
atmosphere, a whole way of

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:49.270
approaching the business in a
much more open, embracing

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:51.440
people, accepting people.

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:54.280
It was more challenging in a
way, because it was about

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.130
really dealing with people as
individuals and their needs.

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:59.040
And it was, as you say,
hospitality--

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.300
engaging with the person
in a dialogue--

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:05.030
as opposed to, I'm the chef,
do it my way, and just shut

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:09.840
up, which is the old-school
way of approaching it.

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.770
INTERVIEWER: Well, and clearly,
you two talk as if

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:12.370
you're family.

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:14.390
And I know that you've known
each other for 30 years.

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:16.150
So how did you first meet?

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:19.010
MICHAEL ROMANO: The same
place he met his wife.

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:21.400
INTERVIEWER: Clearly a great
restaurant for you.

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:25.370
DANNY MEYER: It was a seafood
restaurant on 22nd Street that

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:26.980
was called Pesca.

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:28.980
I think it was actually a little
bit ahead of its time.

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:32.980
It was San Francisco, a
little bit Italian.

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:34.930
It was a really good
restaurant.

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:38.460
And they ended up going out of
business at a certain point.

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:41.030
It then became Bolo,
under Bobby Flay.

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:42.870
And now it's a wreck-ball
site.

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:43.505
There's nothing there.

00:06:43.505 --> 00:06:44.970
It's kind of sad.

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:48.340
But that was my first
restaurant job.

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:52.200
And I'll never forget, there
came a day when-- in addition

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:55.720
to Pesca's chef, a
guy named Skip--

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.400
there was this new guy
who had just been

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:58.870
brought in from France.

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:01.390
And none of us knew why
he was there, but--

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:03.820
MICHAEL ROMANO: Including me.

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:05.420
DANNY MEYER: But he
was clearly cut

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:06.720
from a different cloth.

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:10.730
He was all buttoned up, whereas
everybody else was

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:11.750
kind of slouching.

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:16.110
And he wore one of these
fancy white kerchiefs.

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:19.390
He looked like a Boy Scout,
almost, with his

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:21.190
little white kerchief.

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:23.430
And then he would leave the
restaurant wearing Armani

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:27.170
suits, which we didn't even know
what that was in 1984.

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:31.710
And actually, I was so impressed
with Michael's work

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:36.050
that I begged the owner of the
restaurant to let me move to

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:39.340
the kitchen, because I had been
the lunch maitre d', or

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:41.610
the lunch assistant manager.

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:43.950
And we got to know each other.

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:45.770
I got to--

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:47.730
I don't think they gave
me very many jobs.

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:50.920
I got to snip the faces off
of soft-shell crabs.

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:53.590
INTERVIEWER: All the glamorous
work, clearly.

00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:55.710
DANNY MEYER: Saute
a couple things.

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:58.560
Finally graduated me to
the risotto station--

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:01.120
the risotto al mare,
I remember that.

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:02.870
But anyway, then he was gone.

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:04.140
All of a sudden, he
was just gone.

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:06.240
And I had no idea
where he went.

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:07.550
Where'd you go?

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:08.350
MICHAEL ROMANO: La Caravelle.

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:10.850
DANNY MEYER: Oh, La Caravelle,
that's right.

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:12.450
And we stayed in touch.

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:19.310
Michael became famous because
not only was he a really good

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:23.840
chef, but he was the first young
American chef ever hired

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:26.760
at one of the fancy midtown
French restaurants.

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:30.160
And back then, all the good
restaurants, or all the

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:32.110
restaurants that were taken
seriously in New York-- this

00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:33.750
is going to sound crazy
to you guys--

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:35.230
but they were all in midtown.

00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:38.210
And they all started
with le, la, or il.

00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:42.549
Every single one, because we
didn't trust that Americans

00:08:42.549 --> 00:08:44.135
really knew how to
cook that well.

00:08:44.135 --> 00:08:44.194
[?

00:08:44.194 --> 00:08:44.550
INTERVIEWER: Didn't
know what they ?]

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:45.380
[? were doing. ?]

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:47.140
I know you mentioned
him wearing suits.

00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:49.400
Is that a tradition that
you still continue?

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:52.280
Because you used to say, early
on in your career--

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:53.990
MICHAEL ROMANO: I loosened
up a bit,

00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:55.720
because coming from the--

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:57.010
DANNY MEYER: What did
you used to say?

00:08:57.010 --> 00:08:58.110
What did he used to say?

00:08:58.110 --> 00:08:59.520
INTERVIEWER: That every
day you would come

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:00.280
in wearing a suit.

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:00.780
MICHAEL ROMANO: Yeah,
definitely.

00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:02.420
Well, because at
La Caravelle--

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:06.150
again, the midtown French--

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:07.900
that was sort of the dress
code of the restaurant.

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:09.340
And that's how our
guests dressed.

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:13.360
And it was appropriate, and
the owners felt it was

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:15.960
appropriate to dress
the same way.

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:19.040
And yeah, it used to
get a little crazy.

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:21.960
Because I would go in for
the morning service,

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:23.530
change into my whites.

00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:26.050
And then after the morning
service, change back into the

00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:29.350
suit, go out and maybe go to
the gym or do something.

00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:30.950
And come back, change
again, and then

00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:32.050
leave and change again.

00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:33.900
It was a lot of changing.

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:36.160
INTERVIEWER: And you don't see
many chefs in suits, I feel,

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:36.820
these days.

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:38.840
MICHAEL ROMANO: Well,
times have changed.

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:39.400
INTERVIEWER: Right.

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:41.680
So can you remember the first
family meal that you guys

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:43.810
shared together?

00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:44.460
MICHAEL ROMANO: It's
probably Pesca.

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:46.220
DANNY MEYER: I think
it was at Pesca.

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:48.490
And I was just telling
somebody this

00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:49.570
story the other day.

00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:53.170
But that was a really hard time,
because that was when we

00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:55.050
were first learning
about AIDS.

00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:56.990
This was in 1984.

00:09:56.990 --> 00:09:59.440
We had never heard about
this illness before.

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:05.650
And one of the servers at the
restaurant had been sick with

00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:06.660
something mysterious.

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:08.115
He was losing weight
like crazy.

00:10:08.115 --> 00:10:11.280
He was breaking out in a way
no one had ever seen.

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:13.050
And he would come back
and work for a while.

00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:14.110
And then he would leave.

00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:16.260
No one had any idea
what it was.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.970
But it was at family meal where
we learned about it.

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:24.880
It was hard, because one of the
things that does happen at

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:29.600
family meal is that the chef or
the sous chef prepares the

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:31.500
specials for that day.

00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:33.105
And the whole staff
tastes them.

00:10:33.105 --> 00:10:35.800
So that when you come to the
restaurant and you say, so

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:38.840
what do you recommend,
the waiter can

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:41.820
have an informed answer.

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:46.540
And that was the meal where we
were told that that was going

00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:47.410
to stop happening.

00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:48.340
There's no more sharing.

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:50.980
Back then, we would all take the
exact same fork and just

00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:52.480
pass it around.

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:55.660
And that was one of the family
meals I remember most.

00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:59.860
The other one I remember most
was the first time that I had

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:02.790
ever had a job where we were
allowed to drink wine before

00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:04.230
going to work.

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:07.360
And I thought that
was pretty cool.

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:08.430
INTERVIEWER: I think
we'd all agree.

00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:11.160
DANNY MEYER: And we would do
wine tastings together.

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:13.650
And that became a hallmark of
how we did our training at

00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:14.520
Union Square Cafe.

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:18.740
But that's something that I
think we both learned at

00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:19.310
various times.

00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:21.980
I only cooked in France for
about three months.

00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:25.010
Michael cooked there for about
three years, and Switzerland.

00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:25.710
MICHAEL ROMANO: Six
years, yeah.

00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:26.800
DANNY MEYER: Six years.

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:31.980
But there was never a family
meal in France where the staff

00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:35.140
didn't sit down together, and
not only have their food

00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:39.110
before you would come into the
restaurant, but we'd actually

00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:40.220
have a glass of wine together.

00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:41.770
And everybody trusted it.

00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:44.950
Nobody was abusing the system.

00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:45.850
It was good.

00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:47.990
MICHAEL ROMANO: I remember one
place I worked in France where

00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:52.380
there was a young chef, very,
very talented, but a little

00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:53.250
impetuous and headstrong.

00:11:53.250 --> 00:11:54.570
And he would come in--

00:11:54.570 --> 00:11:56.930
I'd be having a chamomile
tea in the morning-- the

00:11:56.930 --> 00:11:58.220
morning, this is.

00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:00.650
And he'd come over to my station
and dump out the tea,

00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:02.060
and pour in white
wine in the cup.

00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:04.510
He was like, get to work.

00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:07.180
I said, OK.

00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:08.880
INTERVIEWER: So over the course
of the past 30 years,

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:11.170
what would you both say are
some of the best and worst

00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:14.640
parts about working
with each other?

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:15.040
DANNY MEYER: Come on.

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:17.970
INTERVIEWER: You can just
say positive things.

00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:20.180
DANNY MEYER: That wasn't part
of our contract, that we had

00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:20.650
to talk about that.

00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:22.380
INTERVIEWER: Family question.

00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:23.190
DANNY MEYER: I'm going
to go with the best.

00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:24.650
He can talk about the worst.

00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:25.870
MICHAEL ROMANO: Should
I leave?

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:30.410
DANNY MEYER: No, the best
part, I think, were that

00:12:30.410 --> 00:12:32.690
almost every single year--

00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:35.310
keep in mind, we had one
restaurant, Union Square Cafe,

00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:36.480
for the first 10 years.

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:39.530
So it hasn't really till the
last period of time that we've

00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:41.150
been expanding.

00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:44.290
Gramercy Tavern was our second
restaurant after 10 years.

00:12:44.290 --> 00:12:46.980
And then there was Eleven
Madison Park and Tabla, and

00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:49.660
Blue Smoke, and Maialino and
Shake Shack, and the Modern,

00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:51.610
North End Grill.

00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:51.850
INTERVIEWER: Catch a breath.

00:12:51.850 --> 00:12:53.430
DANNY MEYER: Now Creative
Juice, which we're very

00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:54.010
excited about.

00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:56.870
I saw them pouring their
juice upstairs.

00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:58.580
So that was good to see.

00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:02.530
But anyway, during those
first 10 years--

00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:05.500
same number of hours in the day,
but we just spent a whole

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:06.780
lot more of them together.

00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:11.010
And we would go on a lot of
culinary expeditions.

00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:12.220
It could be in Italy.

00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:13.360
It could be France.

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:16.820
It could be parts
of this country.

00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:21.940
And the most fun would be
to just go get ideas.

00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:26.690
And keep in mind, guys, this
was way before Google.

00:13:26.690 --> 00:13:28.670
And it was way before
things like GPS.

00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:32.380
So if you wanted to go
discover a new idea--

00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:35.340
which you need to do for
your restaurants--

00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:37.620
you would really do the
old-fashioned kind of sleuth

00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:40.010
work, which was meeting the
right people, asking the right

00:13:40.010 --> 00:13:43.400
questions, turning over
the right rocks.

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:48.470
And you would find your way to
some out-of-the-way bistro in

00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:53.080
the countryside of France, or
trattoria in the countryside

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:54.840
outside of Bologna, let's say.

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:59.100
And you would take your Michelin
map and do the best

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:02.100
you could to find these little
roads that barely even existed

00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:03.730
on the best map in the world.

00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:06.340
And by doing that work a little
harder than anyone else

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:11.350
did, we could often discover
dishes that no one had seen in

00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:12.040
New York City.

00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:15.900
And we could bring them back
here together, serve them at

00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:17.080
Union Square Cafe.

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:20.530
And we would have a two-year
runway before--

00:14:20.530 --> 00:14:23.650
and people would love it--
before anyone would copy it.

00:14:23.650 --> 00:14:27.410
Today, that's so hard, because
by the time we find a place,

00:14:27.410 --> 00:14:29.385
it's already been
photographed.

00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:33.960
MICHAEL ROMANO: Remember panna
cotta in Piedmont?

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:34.770
DANNY MEYER: Of course I do.

00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:37.000
MICHAEL ROMANO: No, I mean that
fits the description of

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:37.520
what you're saying.

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:39.080
DANNY MEYER: Yeah, I remember
the restaurant where we had

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:40.460
it, in La Morra.

00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:42.130
MICHAEL ROMANO: Yeah, it
was mind-boggling.

00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:43.330
Just this incredible--

00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:45.990
and panna cotta has become
the quiche of--

00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:48.470
DANNY MEYER: And do you
remember the pollo al

00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:51.460
lambrusco with the frittata
with the balsamico and--

00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:52.250
MICHAEL ROMANO: I'm
getting hungry.

00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:55.210
INTERVIEWER: You guys all
ate lunch already.

00:14:55.210 --> 00:14:56.840
DANNY MEYER: Those were
the best times.

00:14:56.840 --> 00:15:02.530
And for me, the best day ever
was we were going to try to do

00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:04.570
a French version of
Union Square Cafe.

00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:07.930
That's kind of how Eleven
Madison Park started off.

00:15:07.930 --> 00:15:14.000
It was going to be a bistro
brasserie, but not too fancy.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.510
That was how Eleven Madison
got its start.

00:15:16.510 --> 00:15:18.450
And so we went to Paris.

00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:22.480
And the very first day, right
off the airplane, we ate six

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:24.220
Michelin stars--

00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:27.350
two three-star restaurants
in a row.

00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:29.810
And my favorite part was you
were knocked out by the time

00:15:29.810 --> 00:15:32.090
we got to dessert.

00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:34.540
And we had five bistros
to hit the next day.

00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:35.780
MICHAEL ROMANO: The jet
lag and fois gras

00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:36.490
together, it's just--

00:15:36.490 --> 00:15:38.210
INTERVIEWER: As long as your
head didn't land up in the

00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:38.810
plate, I think that's fine.

00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:41.540
MICHAEL ROMANO: Deadly,
deadly combination.

00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:43.600
INTERVIEWER: And then so what
about your parents?

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:45.740
Were they encouraging of
this career choice?

00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:48.720
Obviously, it's worked out
for you both, but--

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:51.170
MICHAEL ROMANO: No, my parents
were not thrilled when I told

00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:52.530
them I was quitting--

00:15:52.530 --> 00:15:55.720
I had gotten through two years
of regular college at Fordham.

00:15:55.720 --> 00:16:01.026
And I was working at a
restaurant, Serendipity, on

00:16:01.026 --> 00:16:02.850
the east side there-- which
is still there.

00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:04.220
It's amazing.

00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:06.660
And the owners of that
restaurant introduced me to

00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:11.770
James Beard, who gave me that
little bit of encouragement to

00:16:11.770 --> 00:16:12.840
pursue this.

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:14.800
He said, if you really like
cooking, why don't you do it

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:16.580
as a career, go to school,
learn how to do it?

00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:19.590
So I quit college and
enrolled in a--

00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:21.180
and the City University had--

00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:22.360
has, still--

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:24.290
a hotel and restaurant
program.

00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:26.380
My parents were not thrilled
to hear that I was quitting

00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:29.030
college, because it was their
dream to have their children--

00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:30.630
my sister and myself--

00:16:30.630 --> 00:16:32.890
go to college.

00:16:32.890 --> 00:16:33.910
But it was the right thing.

00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:34.930
It really was the right thing.

00:16:34.930 --> 00:16:39.400
Once I got into that school
and started learning about

00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:42.535
cooking in a professional way
and running a restaurant, I

00:16:42.535 --> 00:16:43.480
was so happy.

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:46.970
It felt like this is what
I really want to do.

00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:49.160
And I did very well at
it, because I could

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:50.430
really apply myself.

00:16:50.430 --> 00:16:53.150
And school had become
such a drag.

00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:55.010
I was really not enjoying it.

00:16:55.010 --> 00:16:57.830
But this was wonderful.

00:16:57.830 --> 00:16:58.650
INTERVIEWER: Danny,
what about you?

00:16:58.650 --> 00:17:02.790
DANNY MEYER: Well, I don't think
anyone in my particular

00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:06.880
generation who had gotten a
liberal arts degree was even

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:09.319
remotely thinking about going
into the restaurant business.

00:17:09.319 --> 00:17:12.014
It was just way before
Food TV.

00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:17.700
Dining out has really become
a spectator sport.

00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:19.599
And it's something that--

00:17:19.599 --> 00:17:21.109
I think we've gotten
really lucky.

00:17:21.109 --> 00:17:23.859
I think we were born
at the right time.

00:17:23.859 --> 00:17:25.970
People reserved really
good food for

00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:27.290
anniversaries and birthdays.

00:17:27.290 --> 00:17:30.430
And on the other occasions, they
went to a bar or a pub,

00:17:30.430 --> 00:17:33.820
or just the local restaurant.

00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:38.200
But it wasn't something that
people pursued and followed

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:40.610
and took pictures of.

00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:43.480
Forget tweeting and OpenTable
and all that kind of stuff.

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:44.850
It just didn't exist.

00:17:44.850 --> 00:17:49.100
So it was completely not
something that I thought I was

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:49.580
going to do.

00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:52.940
But I just feel so lucky
to have done it.

00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:55.270
I had been thinking about
becoming a lawyer.

00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:59.400
And it was on the eve of taking
my LSATs that I freaked

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:01.260
out over dinner.

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:03.240
I was with my aunt and uncle
and a grandmother.

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:05.650
And I couldn't drink wine.

00:18:05.650 --> 00:18:07.890
I couldn't eat a lot of food,
because I was so nervous about

00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:09.300
the next morning.

00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:12.190
And my uncle basically--

00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:14.640
so it actually was someone
in my family that

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:17.490
caused this to happen.

00:18:17.490 --> 00:18:20.330
And when he asked me what was
bothering me, I said, because

00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:21.540
I'm taking my LSATs.

00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:24.050
And he said, well, you do want
to be a lawyer, don't you?

00:18:24.050 --> 00:18:26.750
And I said, no.

00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:29.090
And he basically dropped
his fork.

00:18:29.090 --> 00:18:31.290
And he said, you know, you're
going to be dead forever.

00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:33.860
Why in the world would you do
something that you don't love

00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:36.650
during these few moments
that you're alive?

00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:38.710
And I said, because I don't know
what else to do with my

00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:41.860
political science degree.

00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:43.820
And he said, that's the
stupidest answer I've ever

00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:45.390
heard in my life.

00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:47.040
And I said, well, what
should I do?

00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:49.000
And he said, are you kidding?

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000
I mean, all I've ever heard
you talk about is

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.740
restaurants and food.

00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:54.630
And I said, should I go
eat in restaurants

00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:56.990
the rest of my life?

00:18:56.990 --> 00:19:00.750
It still didn't dawn on me that
this was a viable kind of

00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:02.000
career path.

00:19:04.330 --> 00:19:06.160
He gave me a hard time.

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:08.910
He said, I'm not talking to you
again until you answer the

00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:10.610
question the right way.

00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:14.260
And literally, I took the LSATs
that Saturday morning,

00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:15.000
never applied.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.080
And it was the Monday thereafter
that I called one

00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:22.650
of my buddies from college and
said, let's go to restaurant

00:19:22.650 --> 00:19:24.090
school together.

00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:26.520
And he made the mistake of
telling his dad, who said,

00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:28.750
over my dead body.

00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:31.300
And his dad sent him
to business school.

00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:33.600
We're still good friends,
but he got out.

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:35.620
But he did introduce me--

00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:37.280
he was in a bank training
program.

00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:38.740
And he introduced me to--

00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:41.670
back then, banks would never
lend money to restaurants.

00:19:41.670 --> 00:19:44.370
But their bank, US Trust,
had exactly one

00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:46.960
restaurant client, Pesca.

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:50.720
And my friend said, the least
I can do is to introduce you

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:53.020
to our one restaurant client.

00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:55.150
They're really nice people,
and I can get you

00:19:55.150 --> 00:19:56.880
an interview there.

00:19:56.880 --> 00:20:01.000
And I got the interview, which
consisted of being looked up

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.080
and down, and the owner
said, he'll do.

00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:07.340
That was, again, before
HR departments.

00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:13.400
And if it had not been for
taking the LSATs, the next day

00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:17.640
calling the guy I called, and
him feeling bad but hooking me

00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:19.770
up with that one restaurant--

00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:21.200
I never would be in
this industry.

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:22.420
I never would have met him.

00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:24.810
I never would have
met my wife.

00:20:24.810 --> 00:20:31.090
So just for me, it's a great
lesson that every day we get

00:20:31.090 --> 00:20:34.670
presented with these incredible
options that you

00:20:34.670 --> 00:20:38.100
didn't even know were going to
present themselves to you.

00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:41.580
And in each case, if you really
go with your gut and

00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:44.650
your passion, it's just
remarkable as you look back

00:20:44.650 --> 00:20:47.910
over time how your
life can change.

00:20:47.910 --> 00:20:48.380
INTERVIEWER: Absolutely.

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:51.240
Well, I think we're all glad
that it worked out.

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:52.620
MICHAEL ROMANO: I want
to go back a second.

00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:53.750
I never got to answer that.

00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:55.430
DANNY MEYER: Yeah, Michael's
not glad it worked out, so

00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:58.310
he's going to tell you what
he hates about me.

00:20:58.310 --> 00:20:58.460
MICHAEL ROMANO: No.

00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:01.430
No, like you, I will say what
was great about it, and--

00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:02.490
DANNY MEYER: But?

00:21:02.490 --> 00:21:06.000
MICHAEL ROMANO: No, it was
coming to Union Square Cafe.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.570
So I had already had I don't
know how many years of

00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:10.800
experience in the business.

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:16.450
And talked with Danny, and
persuaded me to come to this

00:21:16.450 --> 00:21:19.460
downtown place that was not what
I thought was my career

00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:21.120
path, which was the
classic French.

00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:27.480
But once there, I think the best
thing was watching Danny,

00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:31.070
who was very inexperienced
at this thing, but really

00:21:31.070 --> 00:21:31.960
passionate about it.

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:32.660
DANNY MEYER: I was very--

00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:40.030
MICHAEL ROMANO: And learning and
creating and growing, and

00:21:40.030 --> 00:21:41.220
what we have now--

00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:43.050
our restaurant group.

00:21:43.050 --> 00:21:46.570
And not only the physical
places, but the ideas, the

00:21:46.570 --> 00:21:49.240
philosophy that are very
important, and I

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:50.760
think really beautiful.

00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:57.520
Watching that spark ignite
in you and develop

00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:59.250
was really the best.

00:21:59.250 --> 00:22:00.740
I mean, the trips were wonderful
and all that.

00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:07.320
But this whole idea of watching
this just blossom was

00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:08.360
an amazing process.

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:09.280
And it's still going on.

00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:10.860
DANNY MEYER: And that's a
philosophy we call enlightened

00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:13.370
hospitality, which I
know is pretty--

00:22:13.370 --> 00:22:15.090
what we call it is just
what we call it.

00:22:15.090 --> 00:22:17.770
But I think it's how you guys
run your company, which is

00:22:17.770 --> 00:22:21.800
basically saying, no business
in the world is different in

00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:22.910
terms of the stakeholders.

00:22:22.910 --> 00:22:25.670
We all have the exact same five
stakeholders, but in what

00:22:25.670 --> 00:22:27.870
order are you going to
prioritize them?

00:22:27.870 --> 00:22:31.200
And I think "family meal" is
actually a great expression of

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:37.090
saying, if you really want the
best outcome, you've got to

00:22:37.090 --> 00:22:38.300
start with yourself.

00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:41.440
You've got to take care of
your own team first, even

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:43.540
before you put your
guests second.

00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:48.800
And the notion of putting your
customers second was certainly

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:50.290
not anything we were
taught about.

00:22:50.290 --> 00:22:54.280
And the notion of putting your
investors fifth, after your

00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:57.050
employees, after your customers,
after your

00:22:57.050 --> 00:22:59.440
community, after your suppliers,
and really

00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:01.800
believing that by virtue of
doing it that way, you create

00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:03.680
a virtuous cycle.

00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:07.110
And you can make more money if
you put your investors fifth.

00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:09.250
And you can make more customers
happy if you put

00:23:09.250 --> 00:23:10.840
your customer second--

00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:12.670
is what we've developed
over time.

00:23:12.670 --> 00:23:14.790
Now just quickly, I thought
Michael was going to say the

00:23:14.790 --> 00:23:16.990
worst thing, which
was that in the--

00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:19.910
it took me eight months, even
though we knew each other, to

00:23:19.910 --> 00:23:24.350
convince him to leave this
fancy-schmancy French

00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:25.620
restaurant on 55th Street.

00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:26.520
It was a great restaurant.

00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:28.110
I don't blame him for not
wanting to leave.

00:23:28.110 --> 00:23:29.690
But come on, Union
Square Cafe?

00:23:29.690 --> 00:23:31.890
INTERVIEWER: Didn't have a le
or an il in front of it.

00:23:31.890 --> 00:23:35.190
DANNY MEYER: And finally-- yeah,
I was even willing to

00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:38.790
call it Il Union Square
if that would help.

00:23:38.790 --> 00:23:40.540
I was even going to
change the name.

00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:44.900
But anyway, finally, after about
month six, I convinced

00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:48.120
him to at least come downtown
and experience the restaurant

00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:49.850
just as a guest.

00:23:49.850 --> 00:23:51.850
OK, don't take my word
for it, Michael.

00:23:51.850 --> 00:23:53.060
Just see it.

00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:55.180
And so he brings in
three people.

00:23:55.180 --> 00:23:57.450
They're a table for four.

00:23:57.450 --> 00:23:58.110
And--

00:23:58.110 --> 00:23:59.010
do you remember what
happened there?

00:23:59.010 --> 00:23:59.820
MICHAEL ROMANO: Yeah.

00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:00.290
DANNY MEYER: On that night?

00:24:00.290 --> 00:24:02.650
And of course, I'm very nervous,
because my whole

00:24:02.650 --> 00:24:05.330
future is hinging upon
this one meal here.

00:24:05.330 --> 00:24:08.520
MICHAEL ROMANO: And Danny was
very generous and brought over

00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:11.120
four complimentary glasses
of champagne on a tray.

00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:15.270
He himself was in the dining
room, carrying the tray with

00:24:15.270 --> 00:24:17.470
the four glasses of champagne,
which he proceeded

00:24:17.470 --> 00:24:20.280
to drop on my lap.

00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:22.980
DANNY MEYER: And not only did
the champagne spill, but one

00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:26.180
of the glasses shattered
all over Michael's lap.

00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:31.540
So obviously, he has a very
good sense of humor.

00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:32.870
INTERVIEWER: It was
a memorable start.

00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:34.360
MICHAEL ROMANO: It
was a good start.

00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:35.360
A good omen.

00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:38.120
INTERVIEWER: So 30 years
now, third cookbook.

00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:41.280
Whose idea was it to create
the "Family Table"?

00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:43.320
DANNY MEYER: 27 and 1/2 years.

00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:44.690
Just want to-- don't push us.

00:24:44.690 --> 00:24:48.100
INTERVIEWER: Nearly 30 years.

00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:52.070
MICHAEL ROMANO: Well, the
coauthor, Karen Stabiner,

00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:56.540
whose daughter works in our
company, and was a fairly

00:24:56.540 --> 00:25:00.110
regular diner at our company--

00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:03.850
observed something we
knew very well.

00:25:03.850 --> 00:25:07.850
That every day, twice a day, our
entire staff sits down to

00:25:07.850 --> 00:25:11.400
meals that are prepared by the
cooks, for the cooks and the

00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:12.190
dining room.

00:25:12.190 --> 00:25:15.440
And she had a conversation
with us.

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:18.670
And we thought there could be
something wonderful in this,

00:25:18.670 --> 00:25:22.570
in presenting not
only the food--

00:25:22.570 --> 00:25:24.870
the recipes of what's being
prepared-- but also the

00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:27.900
stories to celebrate the
people who animate our

00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:30.620
restaurants, who are the
lifeblood of our restaurants.

00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:32.890
Because there's so many
wonderful stories about--

00:25:32.890 --> 00:25:35.000
some of them have been
there 25 years.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:40.190
And in that time, people assume
certain roles, some

00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:43.630
iconic roles, that become
very important--

00:25:43.630 --> 00:25:44.930
just like in a family--

00:25:44.930 --> 00:25:47.950
to the smooth running
of the operation.

00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:50.980
And they're the people who bring
in the new people and

00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:52.770
show them what to do
and what not to do.

00:25:52.770 --> 00:25:55.550
And it's important that they're
like the anchors that

00:25:55.550 --> 00:25:58.900
hold the history of the
place together.

00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:03.190
So as we got into the work a
little bit more, it became

00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:04.090
very, very interesting.

00:26:04.090 --> 00:26:07.780
Because one of the big
challenges for me, unlike the

00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:10.440
first two books we did,
those were my recipes.

00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:12.940
Those were recipes we were
serving in the Union Square

00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:14.710
Cafe that were tried and true.

00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:16.810
It was just a matter of
selecting them and then

00:26:16.810 --> 00:26:19.880
getting them to the home size.

00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:21.200
These were not my recipes.

00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:23.390
These were recipes that the
cooks were making for

00:26:23.390 --> 00:26:24.070
themselves.

00:26:24.070 --> 00:26:26.370
And in fact, there
was no recipe.

00:26:26.370 --> 00:26:28.530
They were just throwing
stuff together.

00:26:28.530 --> 00:26:31.100
DANNY MEYER: They would just go
raid the refrigerator for

00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:32.600
the items that--

00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:35.320
when you're cooking, there's
always stuff that you

00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:38.980
butchered on the side, or the
leaves of something where you

00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:43.210
used the part of the fruit
or the vegetable.

00:26:43.210 --> 00:26:44.080
MICHAEL ROMANO: They come
up with dishes.

00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:45.610
DANNY MEYER: These
guys are amazing.

00:26:45.610 --> 00:26:47.280
They have lots and lots
of really good

00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:48.460
ingredients to cook with.

00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:51.700
They have only a little bit of
time to do it, because they're

00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:53.860
spending so much time
preparing for

00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:56.060
when you come in.

00:26:56.060 --> 00:26:58.140
And they've got to come up
with something that's

00:26:58.140 --> 00:27:01.500
economical, quick, and can be
done in large portions.

00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:02.540
And what they tend to do--

00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:03.200
MICHAEL ROMANO: And delicious.

00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:03.455
DANNY MEYER: And delicious.

00:27:03.455 --> 00:27:05.640
Because they're cooking for each
other, and they're going

00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:07.330
to get immediate feedback.

00:27:07.330 --> 00:27:09.340
And they want to take
care of each other.

00:27:09.340 --> 00:27:13.100
And what's amazing about
it is they also draw--

00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:15.400
unlike in the restaurant, where
we're trying to create

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:19.140
food that's going to feel like,
this is something I

00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:21.870
never could have done at home,
that's why I like going there.

00:27:21.870 --> 00:27:22.870
You don't just go there
because we're

00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:25.060
going to do your dishes.

00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:27.510
These cooks are cooking things
from their home.

00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:31.530
And so through this book, you're
going to find all kinds

00:27:31.530 --> 00:27:33.220
of ethnic touches.

00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:36.690
Because if you give some really
good beef to this guy,

00:27:36.690 --> 00:27:39.200
and he's from the Dominican
Republic, this is what you're

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:40.060
going to get.

00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:43.430
If you give that same beef to
somebody from Texas, you're

00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:44.790
going to get something
completely different.

00:27:44.790 --> 00:27:45.480
MICHAEL ROMANO: Or Korea.

00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:48.880
DANNY MEYER: Or Korea or
Ecuador or Colombia.

00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:53.870
And so what's fun about this
book is that the only

00:27:53.870 --> 00:28:00.140
through-line is this is food
from the heart, from people

00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:04.310
who go to work for the purpose
of taking care of people.

00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:06.810
INTERVIEWER: What I thought was
really interesting about

00:28:06.810 --> 00:28:09.990
the book is it's not just
the high-profile chefs--

00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:11.990
who are part of Union Square
Hospitality Group, that you

00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:13.640
hear about so often--

00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:15.670
it's a lot of behind-the-scenes
stories.

00:28:15.670 --> 00:28:18.380
It's a lot of people you might
never see front of house.

00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:20.920
So how intentional was that
decision to kind of highlight

00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:22.880
them in the photographs
and the stories?

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:23.980
MICHAEL ROMANO: Completely
intentional.

00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:25.670
We did ask the chefs--

00:28:25.670 --> 00:28:28.800
again, who do not cook the
family meal-- to contribute

00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:31.930
recipes that they might cook
for their families or have

00:28:31.930 --> 00:28:33.600
cooked for them.

00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:36.080
The best recipe in the book
is my mother's lasagna.

00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:36.810
And that's how that
got in there.

00:28:36.810 --> 00:28:37.565
DANNY MEYER: According to you.

00:28:37.565 --> 00:28:41.020
MICHAEL ROMANO: According
to me, that's right.

00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:42.240
DANNY MEYER: I kind of
like our family's

00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:44.490
roast asparagus with--

00:28:44.490 --> 00:28:44.800
anyway.

00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:45.740
But--

00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:47.670
INTERVIEWER: You get the book,
you can check both out and

00:28:47.670 --> 00:28:49.410
then inform us who
the winner is.

00:28:49.410 --> 00:28:50.310
MICHAEL ROMANO: Or serve
one with the other.

00:28:50.310 --> 00:28:54.310
But yeah, it's definitely about
the cooks making this,

00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:58.260
not about the high-profile
chefs.

00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:00.840
INTERVIEWER: And so do dishes
from family meal ever make it

00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:01.540
to the restaurant?

00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:04.320
I know I've heard a lot about
the Dominican beef.

00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:05.160
MICHAEL ROMANO: That has.

00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:08.990
It's a dish that Victor's been
making for a long time, as

00:29:08.990 --> 00:29:09.580
long as I can remember.

00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:11.820
And every time he makes
it, I'm so delighted.

00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:14.400
And now the current chef, Carmen
Quagliata, who's the

00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:17.620
brilliant chef at Union
Square Cafe--

00:29:17.620 --> 00:29:19.840
he put it on the branch menu.

00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:22.320
DANNY MEYER: And we've had
that happen at Maialino.

00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:25.820
Our breakfast cook--

00:29:25.820 --> 00:29:27.140
or he was our breakfast cook.

00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:28.890
Now he's at Gramercy Terrace--

00:29:28.890 --> 00:29:31.400
who we lovingly call Hoss.

00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:33.550
He's from New Orleans
originally, or

00:29:33.550 --> 00:29:35.310
somewhere in Louisiana.

00:29:35.310 --> 00:29:39.750
And he would make these
ham-studded biscuits, which

00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:44.210
don't exactly go with a Roman
trattoria, but that's fine.

00:29:44.210 --> 00:29:47.610
Because for family meals, same
thing-- that's where I'm from.

00:29:47.610 --> 00:29:50.910
I've got some ends of the
prosciutto that we couldn't

00:29:50.910 --> 00:29:53.040
slice when you guys come in.

00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:54.160
And they were awesome.

00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:56.750
And he would pour maple
syrup all over them.

00:29:56.750 --> 00:29:57.770
And we sell those now.

00:29:57.770 --> 00:30:00.980
We make a lot of money.

00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:02.770
INTERVIEWER: So how would you
say from a technological

00:30:02.770 --> 00:30:05.420
standpoint advances have changed
the way that you

00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:08.060
approach making cookbooks,
from your first till now?

00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:13.850
Be it photography or--

00:30:13.850 --> 00:30:14.770
DANNY MEYER: That's such
a good question.

00:30:14.770 --> 00:30:18.770
At the end of the day, I think
a cookbook author has to make

00:30:18.770 --> 00:30:20.280
a huge number--

00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:23.240
the first decision you have
to make irrespective of

00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:26.760
technology or photography
is this.

00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:28.310
What's the point of
this cookbook?

00:30:28.310 --> 00:30:33.870
Is this a marketing tool slash
souvenir for the restaurant

00:30:33.870 --> 00:30:37.700
that, while beautiful, will
never be cooked from?

00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:40.970
In other words, is this a book
that we hope might live on

00:30:40.970 --> 00:30:44.140
your living room coffee table?

00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:48.470
Or do we hope this is a book
that you'll actually get olive

00:30:48.470 --> 00:30:51.560
oil all over the pages, and rip
out the pages, because you

00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:53.190
can't stop using it?

00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:57.360
And I would say that more often
than not, we have sided

00:30:57.360 --> 00:31:01.440
on the "we want people to
use it." Our books are--

00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:04.100
I hope you'll find that
it's not unattractive.

00:31:04.100 --> 00:31:08.290
But my bet is that this is not
going to be stacked up with

00:31:08.290 --> 00:31:11.030
the French Laundry and Eleven
Madison Park, which are

00:31:11.030 --> 00:31:13.850
gorgeous, gorgeous cookbooks.

00:31:13.850 --> 00:31:16.160
I think this is one that you're
going to cook from.

00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:20.560
And so I think that the
technology, to a degree that

00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:26.040
that's important, is
that you can--

00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:29.250
I think the only thing that I
think about technology-wise is

00:31:29.250 --> 00:31:32.970
that everything's
done on ebooks.

00:31:32.970 --> 00:31:35.270
But I'm still not sure
that that works

00:31:35.270 --> 00:31:36.710
as well for a cookbook.

00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:38.110
MICHAEL ROMANO: Yeah, but in
the making of the book.

00:31:38.110 --> 00:31:41.680
Other than obviously the
advances in photography--

00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:44.170
digital photography-- but other
than that, it feels

00:31:44.170 --> 00:31:45.610
pretty much about the same.

00:31:45.610 --> 00:31:49.750
Doing this book and the first
book, which came out in '94--

00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:50.950
I don't know that it
was much different.

00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:52.520
DANNY MEYER: And at the end of
the day, what matters more

00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:54.270
than anything is, did you
test the recipes?

00:31:54.270 --> 00:31:54.570
MICHAEL ROMANO: Right.

00:31:54.570 --> 00:31:55.470
DANNY MEYER: Because--

00:31:55.470 --> 00:31:57.370
MICHAEL ROMANO: And
that's the same.

00:31:57.370 --> 00:31:59.790
DANNY MEYER: --as I said, we
don't think we have the

00:31:59.790 --> 00:32:03.280
capability of producing
a gorgeous book.

00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:06.710
So since we know that's not our
greatest strength, what we

00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:08.540
do rely on is what we
think our greater

00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:10.010
strength is, is we want--

00:32:10.010 --> 00:32:12.290
if you cook, we want you
to feel like a winner.

00:32:12.290 --> 00:32:13.720
If you're going to go to the
trouble of buying the

00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:18.990
ingredients and prepping them
in your own kitchen, we want

00:32:18.990 --> 00:32:20.920
you say, that was a really
good use of my time.

00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:23.430
And the way that's going to
happen is that both you and

00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:25.980
the people you're cooking
for say, that was yummy.

00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:27.630
Where'd you get that recipe?

00:32:27.630 --> 00:32:29.630
And that's what we want
to have happen.

00:32:29.630 --> 00:32:33.270
We actually delayed this book
for six months, because we

00:32:33.270 --> 00:32:37.450
were not as thrilled as we
wanted to be with these dishes

00:32:37.450 --> 00:32:40.715
tasting exactly like they tasted
when they were cooked

00:32:40.715 --> 00:32:41.180
for family meal.

00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:41.450
MICHAEL ROMANO: Right.

00:32:41.450 --> 00:32:43.140
Because it was a question of
really developing the recipe.

00:32:43.140 --> 00:32:44.440
DANNY MEYER: Just
had to be tested

00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:46.690
and tested and retested.

00:32:46.690 --> 00:32:49.150
MICHAEL ROMANO: And you have to
be careful with using too

00:32:49.150 --> 00:32:52.250
much high-tech equipment
in testing.

00:32:52.250 --> 00:32:54.910
As a matter of fact, we want
to test not on our

00:32:54.910 --> 00:32:57.920
professional ranges and things,
but on something akin

00:32:57.920 --> 00:33:00.560
to what most folks
have at home.

00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:03.250
Because otherwise, it could
change the recipe.

00:33:03.250 --> 00:33:05.070
DANNY MEYER: And our recipe
tester shops for the

00:33:05.070 --> 00:33:07.780
ingredients in regular
markets.

00:33:07.780 --> 00:33:09.490
We don't just take them
from our restaurants.

00:33:09.490 --> 00:33:13.060
Because again, if it can't be
done with the market that you

00:33:13.060 --> 00:33:16.090
go to, whether it's a
greenmarket or a supermarket,

00:33:16.090 --> 00:33:18.960
then it may not taste right.

00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:21.580
Then the other thing that we
really try to encourage people

00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:24.130
is it's like a piece of music.

00:33:24.130 --> 00:33:26.760
This is how the music
was written.

00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:29.560
Try to play it, and then make
it yours thereafter.

00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:34.340
So Michael doesn't actually stop
in your home and check to

00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:36.410
see if you're doing it right.

00:33:36.410 --> 00:33:37.672
MICHAEL ROMANO: We could
arrange that.

00:33:37.672 --> 00:33:38.490
INTERVIEWER: Yeah, we wish.

00:33:38.490 --> 00:33:42.050
I think there'd be a long
line for that sign-up.

00:33:42.050 --> 00:33:43.980
So we're about to take some
audience questions.

00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:46.940
There are two microphones, if
you guys want to line up.

00:33:46.940 --> 00:33:50.460
And before we do, just to give
you a chance to ask them, we

00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:52.560
have a couple
fill-in-the-blanks.

00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:56.625
So the most challenging
part of my job is--

00:34:01.090 --> 00:34:04.840
DANNY MEYER: I have not yet
succeeded at adding more than

00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:07.570
24 hours to a day.

00:34:07.570 --> 00:34:09.969
INTERVIEWER: When you
do, let us all know.

00:34:09.969 --> 00:34:13.260
MICHAEL ROMANO: I guess coming
up with new ideas, keeping

00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:18.230
things fresh, keeping things
with the times.

00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:21.965
INTERVIEWER: And if I weren't in
this industry, I would be--

00:34:21.965 --> 00:34:23.215
DANNY MEYER: A cookbook
author.

00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:28.670
MICHAEL ROMANO: Maybe in
the music business.

00:34:28.670 --> 00:34:30.350
INTERVIEWER: I hate it
when I get asked--

00:34:30.350 --> 00:34:33.940
hopefully, it's nothing
I asked, but--

00:34:33.940 --> 00:34:36.070
DANNY MEYER: What if it is?

00:34:36.070 --> 00:34:36.489
INTERVIEWER: That's fine.

00:34:36.489 --> 00:34:37.650
I can take it.

00:34:37.650 --> 00:34:38.210
MICHAEL ROMANO: What's
your favorite

00:34:38.210 --> 00:34:39.460
restaurant in New York?

00:34:42.730 --> 00:34:45.469
DANNY MEYER: Why did you
go into this business?

00:34:45.469 --> 00:34:46.030
I'm sorry.

00:34:46.030 --> 00:34:46.810
I just--

00:34:46.810 --> 00:34:49.270
I wish I really knew.

00:34:49.270 --> 00:34:50.170
I wish I knew.

00:34:50.170 --> 00:34:53.659
I think the answer-- and it
actually gives me another

00:34:53.659 --> 00:34:56.870
chance to answer the question,
because it's not my story.

00:34:56.870 --> 00:35:01.490
It's the fact that we all have
something inside of us that,

00:35:01.490 --> 00:35:05.030
if we just listen to
it, there it is.

00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:07.650
And the reason that I don't like
the question is that I

00:35:07.650 --> 00:35:11.080
always end up answering it based
on my story, when it's

00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:14.190
really just everybody's story,
which is just listen to what's

00:35:14.190 --> 00:35:16.520
telling you is there.

00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:18.400
INTERVIEWER: In my fridge,
I always have--

00:35:24.220 --> 00:35:26.693
MICHAEL ROMANO: Japanese
condiments.

00:35:26.693 --> 00:35:27.943
DANNY MEYER: Really?

00:35:31.030 --> 00:35:33.270
Mayonnaise.

00:35:33.270 --> 00:35:36.430
INTERVIEWER: My hangover
cure is--

00:35:36.430 --> 00:35:38.990
DANNY MEYER: Another drink.

00:35:38.990 --> 00:35:41.540
MICHAEL ROMANO: Not getting
out of bed.

00:35:41.540 --> 00:35:45.200
INTERVIEWER: The secret
to Shack's sauce is--

00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:45.420
DANNY MEYER: Untold.

00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:46.570
MICHAEL ROMANO: Will
remain a secret.

00:35:46.570 --> 00:35:48.440
INTERVIEWER: OK, I thought I'd
get you guys with that one.

00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:49.840
At least we tried.

00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:52.600
Lastly, my greatest food
indulgence is--

00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:55.720
MICHAEL ROMANO: Actually the
secret is it tastes good.

00:35:55.720 --> 00:35:56.900
DANNY MEYER: Sausage
and mushroom

00:35:56.900 --> 00:36:00.450
pizza from almost anywhere.

00:36:00.450 --> 00:36:01.570
I have my favorites.

00:36:01.570 --> 00:36:04.800
But you tell me we're going to
have sausage and mushroom

00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:07.250
pizza, I'm there.

00:36:07.250 --> 00:36:10.236
INTERVIEWER: OK, so I think
we've got our first question.

00:36:10.236 --> 00:36:12.990
AUDIENCE: So I like cooking, but
it's hard to compete with

00:36:12.990 --> 00:36:13.720
the chefs at Google.

00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:16.080
So I cook on weekends, and
I have friends over.

00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:19.420
But my trouble that I have with
following recipes is that

00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:22.180
they say, buy a bunch
of stuff--

00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:24.130
some of which I have, some
of which I don't--

00:36:24.130 --> 00:36:26.800
and then I'm not going to cook
until the next week.

00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:30.420
So what I'd really like to do is
be able to say, I have this

00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:32.340
stuff that's sitting
around the kitchen.

00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:33.990
What can I make with it?

00:36:33.990 --> 00:36:38.580
And I'm wondering if you have
given thought to addressing

00:36:38.580 --> 00:36:41.240
for this ingredient here, are
things that you can do with

00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:45.260
it, rather than saying,
make this dish?

00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:48.020
MICHAEL ROMANO: That's an
idea for another book.

00:36:48.020 --> 00:36:48.580
DANNY MEYER: No.

00:36:48.580 --> 00:36:51.860
Michael just said, that's a
great idea for another book.

00:36:51.860 --> 00:36:55.220
I do think, though, that given
what you're concerned about,

00:36:55.220 --> 00:36:58.520
that this book here is--

00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:03.020
it's actually exactly what our
cooks are faced with is the

00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:04.600
exact same thing you're
faced with.

00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:09.430
They don't get to go out
shopping in order--

00:37:09.430 --> 00:37:12.240
they don't get to call the
purveyor and order stuff for

00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:12.970
family meal.

00:37:12.970 --> 00:37:14.660
They're looking in
the refrigerator.

00:37:14.660 --> 00:37:16.320
They're looking in
the cupboard.

00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:18.790
And they're saying, how can
I do a balanced meal?

00:37:18.790 --> 00:37:22.170
Something green, something
starchy, something protein,

00:37:22.170 --> 00:37:24.820
something whatever
it happens to be.

00:37:24.820 --> 00:37:26.800
Because we really cover
the whole gamut--

00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:29.290
not to the degree you guys
do upstairs, perhaps.

00:37:29.290 --> 00:37:32.920
But it's based on what
we have on hand.

00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:35.870
So what I would say,
you can reverse

00:37:35.870 --> 00:37:37.380
engineer this cookbook.

00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:40.160
You can probably reverse
engineer a lot of cookbooks.

00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:43.490
And look at what you have
in your refrigerator.

00:37:43.490 --> 00:37:46.070
And then look in the
ingredients--

00:37:46.070 --> 00:37:49.100
look in the index
of the cookbook.

00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:51.310
I'm pretty sure you're
not going to find

00:37:51.310 --> 00:37:52.850
too many wacky things.

00:37:52.850 --> 00:37:56.910
What I get frustrated about is
a recipe that forces me to go

00:37:56.910 --> 00:37:58.430
buy something.

00:37:58.430 --> 00:38:00.580
And I use a tiny bit.

00:38:00.580 --> 00:38:03.780
And the rest either sits on the
inside of my refrigerator

00:38:03.780 --> 00:38:06.380
door shelving or in the cabinet
for the next three

00:38:06.380 --> 00:38:10.710
years till it gets green on
the edges or something.

00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:14.840
MICHAEL ROMANO: And also, as
you reverse engineer the

00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:18.390
recipe, if you have ingredients
that you have left

00:38:18.390 --> 00:38:21.280
over, if you look at
another recipe that

00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:22.700
attracts your attention.

00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:25.300
And it might not have that
ingredient, but an ingredient

00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:28.410
that is similar and
texture or form.

00:38:28.410 --> 00:38:29.490
And cooking time--

00:38:29.490 --> 00:38:30.500
I'll give an example.

00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:33.250
If you've used celery, and
you've got celery left over.

00:38:33.250 --> 00:38:37.400
And there's something that
calls for fennel.

00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:39.700
Use the celery, you know what
I mean, as a substitute.

00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:40.550
Play around with it.

00:38:40.550 --> 00:38:43.730
And you can use up
what you have.

00:38:43.730 --> 00:38:45.250
It's a good practice to
go through and you

00:38:45.250 --> 00:38:46.190
use up what you have.

00:38:46.190 --> 00:38:49.350
DANNY MEYER: Learning to
liberate yourself, also.

00:38:49.350 --> 00:38:54.070
If a recipe calls for kale, and
all you have is spinach--

00:38:54.070 --> 00:38:54.920
MICHAEL ROMANO: Or chard
or something.

00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:56.780
DANNY MEYER: Yeah, but just use
your head, and say, all

00:38:56.780 --> 00:38:59.610
right, it's not the end of the
world if I put in spinach.

00:38:59.610 --> 00:39:02.170
But spinach is a lot more
tender than kale.

00:39:02.170 --> 00:39:04.440
So if there's a cooking element
to it, you're not

00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:05.690
going to cook it as much.

00:39:09.350 --> 00:39:12.350
It's not rocket science,
this stuff.

00:39:12.350 --> 00:39:17.670
Seriously, just look at this as
a starting point of flavors

00:39:17.670 --> 00:39:19.910
that go together that
make people happy.

00:39:19.910 --> 00:39:22.600
As opposed to a science
experiment that, if you don't

00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:25.145
get it perfectly, it's going
to lead to unhappiness.

00:39:27.730 --> 00:39:31.100
AUDIENCE: So my question is
along those lines, and along

00:39:31.100 --> 00:39:32.940
one of the last ones
you were asked.

00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:35.170
So I have a stack of
cooking books.

00:39:35.170 --> 00:39:37.700
And I now have a new baby.

00:39:37.700 --> 00:39:40.000
And I do cook almost
every night.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:43.270
And I find myself more and
more using a tablet and

00:39:43.270 --> 00:39:47.050
searching on the internet and
putting things together based

00:39:47.050 --> 00:39:50.820
on that, because going to the
cookbook is just hard.

00:39:50.820 --> 00:39:55.940
And I don't think
I'm alone there.

00:39:55.940 --> 00:39:58.450
So the question is, what
would the cookbook of

00:39:58.450 --> 00:39:59.390
the future look like?

00:39:59.390 --> 00:40:02.390
And along the lines of this
question is-- and what you

00:40:02.390 --> 00:40:03.440
suggested is--

00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:06.140
could you make it more dynamic
in the sense that you could

00:40:06.140 --> 00:40:09.290
have a recipe that kind of
evolves with based on what you

00:40:09.290 --> 00:40:12.190
have, and the time you
have, and so on?

00:40:12.190 --> 00:40:14.120
MICHAEL ROMANO: Yeah, it might
be a way to plug in the

00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:17.780
ingredients you have, and then
have that generate a recipe,

00:40:17.780 --> 00:40:19.860
or lead you to an recipe.

00:40:19.860 --> 00:40:20.760
Do an existing one.

00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:21.840
Yeah, that would be cool.

00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:22.540
AUDIENCE: And how do
you pay for that?

00:40:22.540 --> 00:40:26.710
Because right, there is
intellectual property.

00:40:26.710 --> 00:40:31.480
Right now, people post recipes
on the internet.

00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:36.770
And you have to validate them,
as opposed to having some

00:40:36.770 --> 00:40:38.185
validation that came from
some authority.

00:40:38.185 --> 00:40:40.760
And so?

00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:44.510
MICHAEL ROMANO: Well, when the
book goes out, it's open for

00:40:44.510 --> 00:40:47.530
the public to use, including
other restaurants.

00:40:47.530 --> 00:40:51.890
But that's an interesting
point.

00:40:51.890 --> 00:40:53.190
DANNY MEYER: You asked, what
does the cookbook of the

00:40:53.190 --> 00:40:54.060
future look like?

00:40:54.060 --> 00:40:55.390
I've heard for years--

00:40:55.390 --> 00:41:00.870
and I haven't seen it yet-- but
in the same way that it's

00:41:00.870 --> 00:41:02.810
really hard to find a
kitchen that doesn't

00:41:02.810 --> 00:41:04.990
have a microwave oven--

00:41:04.990 --> 00:41:06.930
your kitchen doesn't
have one, does it?

00:41:06.930 --> 00:41:07.380
MICHAEL ROMANO: It does.

00:41:07.380 --> 00:41:08.350
DANNY MEYER: All right,
even his kitchen

00:41:08.350 --> 00:41:10.220
has a microwave oven--

00:41:10.220 --> 00:41:15.560
that people have said that the
tablets will become ubiquitous

00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:19.450
with sort of temperature-proof
fronts.

00:41:19.450 --> 00:41:23.040
And it'll actually be on your
kitchen wall for the purpose

00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:26.970
of being able to look
up recipes.

00:41:26.970 --> 00:41:29.410
And there's so many recipes
online right now.

00:41:29.410 --> 00:41:31.910
In fact, there are websites--

00:41:31.910 --> 00:41:33.930
I forget the name of it--

00:41:33.930 --> 00:41:37.930
that have gotten hundreds and
hundreds of cookbook authors

00:41:37.930 --> 00:41:42.800
to agree to just give it away,
in the hope that, if someone

00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:46.080
likes the one or two recipes
that are on the website, that

00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:46.950
they'll then follow up.

00:41:46.950 --> 00:41:50.540
I guess kind of like a Pandora
version of cookbooks--

00:41:50.540 --> 00:41:53.190
that they'll then go buy the
cookbook thereafter.

00:41:53.190 --> 00:41:57.400
But we haven't done
that ourselves.

00:41:57.400 --> 00:42:00.020
MICHAEL ROMANO: No, but it's
an interesting prospect.

00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:04.140
Just plugging in ingredients,
and having recipes come up.

00:42:04.140 --> 00:42:05.846
You guys could do that.

00:42:05.846 --> 00:42:08.380
Figure out a way to
make that happen.

00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:10.085
INTERVIEWER: We have time
for two more questions.

00:42:10.085 --> 00:42:13.210
AUDIENCE: So one of the things
that I love-- and I'm sure

00:42:13.210 --> 00:42:16.120
many other people love-- about
Shake Shack, particularly the

00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:17.040
park location--

00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:18.190
is that there's the
web camera, and

00:42:18.190 --> 00:42:19.420
you can see the line.

00:42:19.420 --> 00:42:20.860
And I think that's like--

00:42:20.860 --> 00:42:24.400
being here, that you're at
Google is something that I

00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:26.390
think is just very
forward-looking when it came

00:42:26.390 --> 00:42:28.950
out, I don't know how
many years ago, that

00:42:28.950 --> 00:42:30.010
functionality came out.

00:42:30.010 --> 00:42:34.080
But it's just amazing, that sort
of marriage of technology

00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:36.140
and just using it in
a way that's not

00:42:36.140 --> 00:42:38.890
necessarily in your face.

00:42:38.890 --> 00:42:41.450
I would just like to hear your
thoughts about what you think

00:42:41.450 --> 00:42:43.610
may be the next step of how
you might integrate

00:42:43.610 --> 00:42:44.180
technology.

00:42:44.180 --> 00:42:48.880
Maybe not just at Shake Shack,
but some far in the future

00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:50.960
restaurant, or maybe the
next restaurant.

00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:53.490
And what you think might be sort
of the next game-changing

00:42:53.490 --> 00:42:56.040
implementation of maybe
something more technological

00:42:56.040 --> 00:42:57.510
in your restaurants.

00:42:57.510 --> 00:42:58.740
Knowing that that's
not your focus, of

00:42:58.740 --> 00:43:02.360
course, but just an idea.

00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:04.220
DANNY MEYER: Well, I'm glad
you like the Shack cam.

00:43:04.220 --> 00:43:08.190
And as recently as last week,
we had a discussion as to

00:43:08.190 --> 00:43:10.320
whether we should do more
of them with the

00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:12.250
different Shake Shacks.

00:43:12.250 --> 00:43:17.920
And so far, we've decided
not to, just because--

00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:19.400
I don't know.

00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:20.890
We don't want to be
in your face.

00:43:20.890 --> 00:43:24.610
But what I could imagine in
our business, as being the

00:43:24.610 --> 00:43:29.490
next frontier for us, I think
has to do with how you pay in

00:43:29.490 --> 00:43:29.890
the restaurants.

00:43:29.890 --> 00:43:35.450
And I know Starbucks has
invested in the Square, which

00:43:35.450 --> 00:43:41.030
allows you to pay without--

00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:43.730
if it's going to work for
Starbucks to save time and to

00:43:43.730 --> 00:43:47.030
capture information, you can
only imagine how much time you

00:43:47.030 --> 00:43:51.690
could save instead of expecting
and hoping that your

00:43:51.690 --> 00:43:54.400
server in a restaurant knows
exactly when it is that you

00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:57.200
want to go, and exactly
when you're done.

00:43:57.200 --> 00:44:03.370
And I think the opportunity for
us to custom-make more of

00:44:03.370 --> 00:44:08.630
your experience based on
what you like exists.

00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:11.000
And it's somewhere--

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.990
we've made a lot of headway
over the last decade and a

00:44:13.990 --> 00:44:17.440
half with things like OpenTable
that allow you to

00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:19.090
reserve whenever you
want to reserve.

00:44:19.090 --> 00:44:23.980
But also from our end, allows us
to capture more information

00:44:23.980 --> 00:44:29.480
about how often you come to
which of our restaurants,

00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:33.210
where you like to sit, who your
favorite waiter is, what

00:44:33.210 --> 00:44:36.530
your dietary preferences are.

00:44:36.530 --> 00:44:43.590
What we haven't done a great job
of is sort of putting that

00:44:43.590 --> 00:44:54.190
together with giving you the
power to determine more about

00:44:54.190 --> 00:44:58.270
what happens inside of your
experience itself.

00:44:58.270 --> 00:45:03.340
We, to a degree, believe that
high tech and high touch can

00:45:03.340 --> 00:45:04.520
help each other.

00:45:04.520 --> 00:45:08.090
But we're still much more in
the high touch camp when it

00:45:08.090 --> 00:45:10.900
comes to the actual restaurant
experience.

00:45:10.900 --> 00:45:15.550
So if you want to send us any
good ideas, you should know

00:45:15.550 --> 00:45:17.100
that we're aware.

00:45:17.100 --> 00:45:20.280
We know that there's something
else there.

00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:22.940
But getting back to "Family
Table," we just don't want to

00:45:22.940 --> 00:45:25.340
lose the sense that--

00:45:25.340 --> 00:45:30.330
we're happy that you come in
with your camera, and you

00:45:30.330 --> 00:45:32.080
Instagram something
that you loved.

00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:35.670
We think that 95% of the
pictures being taken are to

00:45:35.670 --> 00:45:39.760
tell someone else about
something you liked.

00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:43.280
So we like that technology is
entering the experience.

00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:47.200
But we still kind of hope that
for that time you're at the

00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:51.390
restaurant, it's the time that
you are still with the person

00:45:51.390 --> 00:45:53.310
you're with.

00:45:53.310 --> 00:45:55.952
And not only doing this
the whole time, so.

00:45:58.790 --> 00:46:00.040
MICHAEL ROMANO: That's
a good question.

00:46:02.770 --> 00:46:05.200
AUDIENCE: As a team of
coauthors, I would be so

00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:08.360
interested to know what your
process was like for writing

00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:11.730
the book, from idea generation
to development to getting it

00:46:11.730 --> 00:46:14.610
all down, and any surprises
along the way.

00:46:14.610 --> 00:46:18.830
And kind of whether you guys
had roles that became more

00:46:18.830 --> 00:46:21.130
fixed, or if they overlapped,
and kind of

00:46:21.130 --> 00:46:23.040
how that all worked.

00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:24.690
DANNY MEYER: Can I just go first
and say, I'm not the

00:46:24.690 --> 00:46:26.390
coauthor of this book.

00:46:26.390 --> 00:46:28.740
We have coauthored
books together.

00:46:28.740 --> 00:46:32.570
But Michael's coauthor
was Karen Stabiner.

00:46:32.570 --> 00:46:34.000
All I did was write
the forward.

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:37.640
So I just want to be really
clear that, if you don't like

00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:40.280
the recipes, it's not on me.

00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:45.240
MICHAEL ROMANO: And that process
was pretty clearly

00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:45.990
delineated.

00:46:45.990 --> 00:46:49.720
Karen was the one who had the
sometimes thankless job of

00:46:49.720 --> 00:46:54.710
going in and ascertaining
what--

00:46:54.710 --> 00:46:58.520
once we had determined what were
the recipes we wanted to

00:46:58.520 --> 00:47:02.150
include-- and that was done by
watching and participating in

00:47:02.150 --> 00:47:05.940
the family meals throughout
all of our restaurants--

00:47:05.940 --> 00:47:09.800
then the work had to begin to
sort of capture that recipe

00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:10.570
from the cook.

00:47:10.570 --> 00:47:13.020
And again, this is not an
established recipe that

00:47:13.020 --> 00:47:13.840
someone is doing.

00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:16.600
It's whatever is there that
day, the inspiration that

00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:19.060
comes, a little of this,
a little of that.

00:47:19.060 --> 00:47:22.500
But that little of this and that
had to be turned into 2

00:47:22.500 --> 00:47:25.380
and 1/2 cups of this and
3 tablespoons of that.

00:47:25.380 --> 00:47:28.480
And that's difficult, because
they're not cooking that way.

00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:30.590
They're just throwing
stuff in.

00:47:30.590 --> 00:47:35.110
So Karen did the initial
capture of, here's this

00:47:35.110 --> 00:47:39.120
recipe, here's a rough idea of
what it's going to look like,

00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:41.130
at which point I took over.

00:47:41.130 --> 00:47:45.880
And we had to test it and then
make it work as a recipe.

00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:49.270
And sometimes, that involved an
executive decision of like,

00:47:49.270 --> 00:47:51.620
well, I'm not going to put that
much of that in there.

00:47:51.620 --> 00:47:54.060
I'm going to put a little
of this in here.

00:47:54.060 --> 00:47:57.570
But by and large, we remained
very true to what the initial

00:47:57.570 --> 00:47:58.610
recipe was.

00:47:58.610 --> 00:48:01.340
And then there was the part of
getting the stories, which was

00:48:01.340 --> 00:48:04.780
a similar dynamic of
interviewing and talking to

00:48:04.780 --> 00:48:07.570
people, and getting
that together.

00:48:07.570 --> 00:48:11.080
And then it goes into the
photography, which I had to

00:48:11.080 --> 00:48:14.520
work with the food stylist and
get the food to look right.

00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:16.260
DANNY MEYER: And it took a long
time to figure out who

00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:19.890
would be the right photographer,
because family

00:48:19.890 --> 00:48:23.780
meal is not gorgeous
food by nature.

00:48:23.780 --> 00:48:24.220
It's not.

00:48:24.220 --> 00:48:26.030
INTERVIEWER: Doesn't it just
come looking like that, like

00:48:26.030 --> 00:48:27.070
it does in the book?

00:48:27.070 --> 00:48:27.820
DANNY MEYER: Well, no.

00:48:27.820 --> 00:48:32.710
But the point is that if these
were gorgeous photographs, it

00:48:32.710 --> 00:48:36.090
would lose a lot of the
authenticity that this is what

00:48:36.090 --> 00:48:39.040
we put out on the fly
for each other.

00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:40.830
MICHAEL ROMANO: No tweezers
used to put the--

00:48:40.830 --> 00:48:42.730
DANNY MEYER: And so we had
to find just the right

00:48:42.730 --> 00:48:45.790
photographer who could catch
people being people, and who

00:48:45.790 --> 00:48:49.800
could catch food being food,
and the right stylist who

00:48:49.800 --> 00:48:53.600
understood that a great stylist
wants to be known for

00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:54.780
being a great stylist.

00:48:54.780 --> 00:48:58.130
They don't want to be known for
just letting food be food.

00:48:58.130 --> 00:49:01.565
And so that was an interesting
experience with this cookbook.

00:49:01.565 --> 00:49:01.890
MICHAEL ROMANO: Right.

00:49:01.890 --> 00:49:06.530
And all those choices along
the way have to happen.

00:49:06.530 --> 00:49:10.080
AUDIENCE: Were there any big
surprises in the process?

00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:11.380
MICHAEL ROMANO: Some.

00:49:11.380 --> 00:49:15.600
For me, the surprises were
around recipes that had

00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:20.450
difficulty getting to work, just
because they were so kind

00:49:20.450 --> 00:49:22.700
of raw and inaccurate.

00:49:22.700 --> 00:49:25.380
Or I had to make a decision
that, sometimes with the

00:49:25.380 --> 00:49:29.230
chef's recipes, it was a little
beyond what I thought

00:49:29.230 --> 00:49:31.270
should be included
in a family--

00:49:31.270 --> 00:49:33.770
a little too, maybe too
precious, or it would have

00:49:33.770 --> 00:49:35.540
wound up being too expensive.

00:49:35.540 --> 00:49:40.270
And I'm very sure that that
chef making that dish-- it

00:49:40.270 --> 00:49:42.000
would have turned out amazing.

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:45.110
But I wasn't so sure that it
could have worked in the

00:49:45.110 --> 00:49:46.260
cookbook with the home cook.

00:49:46.260 --> 00:49:48.840
So I had to edit, had to
veto certain things,

00:49:48.840 --> 00:49:50.530
and make the selection.

00:49:50.530 --> 00:49:54.770
So there were some
surprises there.

00:49:54.770 --> 00:49:55.010
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:49:55.010 --> 00:49:55.300
MICHAEL ROMANO: You're welcome

00:49:55.300 --> 00:49:57.040
INTERVIEWER: Michael and Danny,
thank you so much for

00:49:57.040 --> 00:49:59.030
taking time out of your
day to come visit.

00:49:59.030 --> 00:49:59.330
DANNY MEYER: Thank you.

00:49:59.330 --> 00:49:59.630
MICHAEL ROMANO: A pleasure.

00:49:59.630 --> 00:50:04.150
