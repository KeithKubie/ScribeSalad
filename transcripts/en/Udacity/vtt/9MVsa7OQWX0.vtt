00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.370
So now that you've got everything installed, it's ready

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:06.430
to get going with an app Engine App. We've

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:09.700
created a very simple Hello, World app engine application

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.000
that uses M-points. You can find it in the

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.680
lesson two folder that you downloaded from the [UNKNOWN]

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:19.060
for this course. What we're going to do now, is

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.730
import the project into Eclipse. To import a Maven

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.040
project into Eclipse, you go up to the Eclipse

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.870
menu, you choose file, and then you choose Import.

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:33.940
And you open up the Maven folder and choose Existing

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.780
Maven Projects, and then click Next. And then you

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.810
can Browse to the folder that has the project that

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.389
you want to import. I unzip my folder in

00:00:42.389 --> 00:00:45.940
Hello, World endpoints, we have to select the folder itself.

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.800
And then if you want, in advanced, you can

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.940
specify the name, or you can use the default name.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.610
Make sure that pom.xml's selected. Click Next. You may

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.900
see you get some errors. Particularly, the endpoints get discovery

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.680
doc. Don't worry about that, just leave it as resolve

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.060
later, and say, Finish. It'll ask you, if you have

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.350
the error, you'll get a little error message asking you

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.387
if you really want to continue. Just say OK, you

00:01:10.387 --> 00:01:13.970
do. And then the project comes in. It's a little

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.120
hard to see here, but my project is Hello, World.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.280
So this project that you imported, the Hello, World endpoints

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.430
project, is a complete working app. It's very simple, but it's

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.730
complete. It works, and you can run it out of

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:27.920
the box. So I'm going to show you how to run it

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.850
first, and then we're going to look into the code

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.820
that makes up the project. So when you're ready to run

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.120
your project. Go over here, you choose it. Right-click the project,

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.500
choose Run As, and then go ahead and choose Run Configurations.

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.520
You can create a new launch configuration,

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.600
by clicking this New Launch Configuration button

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:54.543
up here. And enter the Base directory, which is where you project is. But you

00:01:54.543 --> 00:01:57.138
can use is variable dollar open brace

00:01:57.138 --> 00:02:00.730
project underscore lock. That points the directory where

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:07.780
your project is. The goal, you need to set it to appengin:def server. And down

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.440
here in the Maven Runtime, you need to make

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.130
sure that the external Maven Runtime is selected. So

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.990
it must say external, not internal. If you need

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.680
to configure it, then you click Configure, and make

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.540
sure that the global settings from installation directory points

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.280
to where your Maven is installed. If you can't

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.810
remember where your Maven's installed, hop over to a

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.264
terminal console window. And hopefully during the Maven installation process,

00:02:33.264 --> 00:02:36.590
you defined the variable M2_HOME. So you can

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.040
go ahead and just echo that. So say, OK.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.200
And say, Apply. And then right here, I could

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.050
go ahead and Run it or I could Close

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:52.100
it. But I'll Run it now. And you see, it starts compiling. And you see here it's

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.410
retrieving the Google App Engine Java SDK from Maven.

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.170
And that's because in the pump.xml, we specified the

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.910
Google App Engine SDK as one of the dependencies. First time

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.820
you run it, it does take a while, because Maven has

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.860
to go off and get all the libraries and everything that

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.090
make up the dependencies in your project. And when it's finished,

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.400
you'll see build success. So the build success means, its finished

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.230
building. And now it's actually going to start running it. And when

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.810
it, when the product is running, the Dev server on local

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.650
host, you see this message info, Dev App Server is now running.

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.560
So, let's make sure it really is. So open the browser

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.690
and go to a new tab, and go to localhost:8080. And if

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.460
for any reason your app is running on a different port,

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:36.670
then just use a different port, but I expect it will be

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:41.650
localhost 8080. And look, the app is running. We're not actually

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.840
going to run the app, I mean, you're welcome to run it

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.150
if you want to, but that's not what we're going to look at

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.780
next. So now I just want to show you how to deploy

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.590
to app spot. So, back here in the, in Eclipse, go

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.530
ahead and select your project, right-click it. Again,

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:04.420
choose Run As and Run Configurations. Click New to add a new configuration.

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.910
Again, add the Base directory. And I can

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.000
just copy that variable into that new configuration.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.980
Now, this time we want to deploy two app spots. So for that, you have to add

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.510
the Goal appengine:update. So here's a goal appengine:update.

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:22.490
Again, make sure the Maven Runtime is says external.

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.850
Now you can Run it. Now the first time

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:26.620
you run it, though, you're going to need to

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.200
give permission to the App Engine cfg application,

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.680
which is an App Engine application that will upload

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.100
your App Engine application. And you'll see, that it's

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.030
asking permission to view and manage your applications deployed

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.040
on Google App Engine. You are going to need

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:45.300
to Accept this. And after you accepted, you'll see

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.030
that it shows you a code says, please copy

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.610
this code, and paste it. So, go ahead and

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.420
copy the entire code, and then go back

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:57.330
to Eclipse. And enter the code. Hit Return. And

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.220
it will keep going. Oh, no. Goodness. I got

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:04.400
another error. 403 Forbidden. You do not have permission

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.620
to modify this app. App_id=u'your-app-id'. Oh, no wait.

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:12.350
Wait. That's not my app ID. I forgot to

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:15.700
configure the app engine web.mxl. And you're going to

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.520
need to do this too. So you go into

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:21.160
the source directory, SRC Source and then into

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.910
the main. Not looking at Java just now. You

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:29.760
need to go into the web actor then you need to go into web in inph and you

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:34.560
see app engine web.xml. And this file is

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.260
where you can figure the properties are very

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.170
specific to App Engine. And the most important

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:41.640
one, for deploying to App Engine is you have

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:48.280
to enter the app ID of your project. And this is the ID that you set in

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:52.340
the developer console, over on console.developers.com. So go

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:54.834
ahead and enter your app ID here, save the

00:05:54.834 --> 00:05:58.958
file, and try running again. Now this time, just

00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:02.210
go to Run As &gt; Maven build. And pick

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:06.250
the run configuration for App Engine update. I forgot

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:08.120
to na, name mine, but here I see it,

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:12.880
App Engine update. Okay, good. It's beginning the interaction,

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:16.150
see it's initiating, it's cloning, it's uploading. Then it

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:18.460
reaches a point where it's pretty much uploaded stuff,

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:20.200
but it needs to ping the app to verify.

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.060
You'll see these messages, will check again in

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:27.650
one, two seconds and so on. And at

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:29.330
this point, all it's really doing is just

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:33.010
trying to ping the app. Can sometimes get hung

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:35.180
here, but usually this doesn't take very long.

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:38.630
Okay, good. So now then again, you see

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:41.470
build success. Now this means, that my apps

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:46.650
been deployed to app spot. Let's go check. So,

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:49.700
to visit your app running on app spot, you

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:54.240
go to your app ID, whatever that is. And

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:58.090
then after you're app ID, you do .appspot.com and

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:00.670
it should take you to your app. And this

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:02.640
looks exactly the same as it did on local

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:04.710
host, but actually we're now running in on app

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:07.580
spot. So, one more thing I wanted to mention

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:11.500
in your project, is that after you deploy it,

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:13.840
whether you deployed it to local host or you deployed

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:19.620
it to app spot, the target directory gets populated with all

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:23.570
the compile code. So, you could actually delete the target

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:27.400
directory, and then re-run your project and it will get recreated.
