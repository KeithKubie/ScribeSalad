00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000
gave an explanation I really like this
 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.729
gave an explanation I really like this
because in so many of these shows of

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739
because in so many of these shows of
 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:42.009
because in so many of these shows of
course the villain can't kill the hero

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:42.019
course the villain can't kill the hero
 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:44.410
course the villain can't kill the hero
because you need the hero alive and why

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420
because you need the hero alive and why
 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:45.970
because you need the hero alive and why
do they keep them alive and they always

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980
do they keep them alive and they always
 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.160
do they keep them alive and they always
have to make up these excuses this is a

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170
have to make up these excuses this is a
 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.559
have to make up these excuses this is a
good excuse they say if we kill you

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:50.569
good excuse they say if we kill you
 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:53.920
good excuse they say if we kill you
you'll just be reincarnated as someone

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930
you'll just be reincarnated as someone
 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.930
you'll just be reincarnated as someone
else see you know it that's how it works

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940
else see you know it that's how it works
 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.259
else see you know it that's how it works
so we're actually gonna keep you alive

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269
so we're actually gonna keep you alive
 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:00.940
so we're actually gonna keep you alive
not only as long as possible but as

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950
not only as long as possible but as
 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.399
not only as long as possible but as
painfully as possible that makes sense

00:03:03.399 --> 00:03:03.409
painfully as possible that makes sense
 

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:06.099
painfully as possible that makes sense
so I that's a very clever way around

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:06.109
so I that's a very clever way around
 

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:08.229
so I that's a very clever way around
especially in the kid show why you can't

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250
alright that this is still managed but
 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:22.880
alright that this is still managed but
like I can do this it's it's a kid but

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:22.890
like I can do this it's it's a kid but
 

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:26.360
like I can do this it's it's a kid but
we can do this uh and I like a Zuko like

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:26.370

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:33.150
again so I like there's a little bit of
 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.000
again so I like there's a little bit of
a variation with the two villains there

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.010
a variation with the two villains there
 

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:41.090

um and the the design of this place as

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:41.100
um and the the design of this place as
 

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:44.000
um and the the design of this place as
always is really good good shadows in

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:44.010
always is really good good shadows in
 

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:47.510
always is really good good shadows in
this one good harsh heavy shadows uh but

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:47.520
this one good harsh heavy shadows uh but
 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.090
this one good harsh heavy shadows uh but
you can still make it out it's not so

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:50.100
you can still make it out it's not so
 

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:51.590
you can still make it out it's not so
bad that you know you're doing what's

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:51.600
bad that you know you're doing what's
 

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.150
bad that you know you're doing what's
going out what you can still make it out

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:53.160
going out what you can still make it out
 

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.330
going out what you can still make it out
and it just makes the scenes so much

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:56.340
and it just makes the scenes so much
 

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:58.010
and it just makes the scenes so much
more menacing and so much more intense

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.020
more menacing and so much more intense
 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:03.080
more menacing and so much more intense
um so the other thing that I say is

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:03.090
um so the other thing that I say is
 

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:05.180
um so the other thing that I say is
really strong in this one that again

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:05.190
really strong in this one that again
 

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:06.710
really strong in this one that again
sort of continuing over from the last

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:06.720
sort of continuing over from the last
 

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:09.830
sort of continuing over from the last
episode is that connection between Aang

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:09.840
episode is that connection between Aang
 

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:12.500
episode is that connection between Aang
and Zuko that there is very much this

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:12.510
and Zuko that there is very much this
 

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:14.150
and Zuko that there is very much this
connection and now they're starting to

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:14.160
connection and now they're starting to
 

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.380
connection and now they're starting to
see it they're starting to sort of

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:15.390
see it they're starting to sort of
 

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:21.050
see it they're starting to sort of
realize it as well um I think Aang puts

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:21.060
realize it as well um I think Aang puts
 

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:25.070
realize it as well um I think Aang puts
it here because he realizes that Zuko is

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:25.080
it here because he realizes that Zuko is
 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:28.040
it here because he realizes that Zuko is
doing this now for himself to get back

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:28.050
doing this now for himself to get back
 

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:30.260
doing this now for himself to get back
something he really needs or he really

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:30.270
something he really needs or he really
 

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:32.300
something he really needs or he really
values and Aang knows that he's

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:32.310
values and Aang knows that he's
 

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:34.010
values and Aang knows that he's
essentially doing what he's doing for

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:34.020
essentially doing what he's doing for
 

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:36.620
essentially doing what he's doing for
the same reason uh and he puts it

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:36.630
the same reason uh and he puts it
 

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:38.060
the same reason uh and he puts it
together you know there's a scene where

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:38.070
together you know there's a scene where
 

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:39.140
together you know there's a scene where
he's sitting with

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:39.150
