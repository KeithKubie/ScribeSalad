00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.964
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.964 --> 00:00:09.524
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:09.524 --> 00:00:10.940
SHAUNA ISAAC: Thank
you very much.

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:12.320
Thanks for that introduction.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:18.680
And thank you all for coming on
this very hot Monday afternoon.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:24.770
The subject of Nazi looting has
been in the news a lot lately.

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:27.050
It seems as if
every week there's

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:32.930
some sort of new Nazi-looted
object that has resurfaced.

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.120
There's been two
feature films made

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.940
about the subject, "The
Monuments Men" and "Woman

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:39.380
in Gold."

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.470
There have been countless
documentaries and books

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:44.690
about this as well.

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.360
It is a complex subject.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.600
So I'm going to
attempt to demystify it

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.880
a little bit by talking
about theft and recovery.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.970
We're going to break the
lecture up into three parts.

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.520
So the first part will
be the theft part.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.060
We'll look at how
the Nazis looted

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:07.820
art and the vast
machinations that they

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.580
used to carry out the looting.

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.540
In the second part
of the lecture,

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.850
we'll look at recovery.

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.030
We'll look at post-war
recovery with the Allies.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.370
And then we'll look at
contemporary recovery.

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:24.870
Then in the final
part of the lecture,

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.550
we're going to get personal.

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:31.310
And I'm going to talk about
a story of Nazi-looted art

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.280
that involved my family.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.680
Through this story
you'll be able to see

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.630
all the nuances of looted
art, theft, and recovery.

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.970
Why did the Nazis loot art?

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.010
It all started at the very
top with Adolf Hitler.

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:57.290
Hitler wanted to create
a monument to his legacy.

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.410
He got the idea for
doing this when he

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.140
visited Italy on a state visit.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.310
He was always interested in art.

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.789
But it wasn't until he
saw these amazing museums

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.470
in Rome and Florence and was
in awe by the artwork that he

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.340
saw there.

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.380
So he decided to create
a monument to his regime.

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.290
And what he was going to
do was build a huge complex

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.300
of galleries and museums.

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.630
This complex would be
known as the Fuhrer Museum.

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.460
Hitler chose to house the
museum in his hometown of Linz,

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:41.986
Austria.

00:02:41.986 --> 00:02:44.900
Linz was a small
industrial town,

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.810
and it doesn't seem like
it would be the ideal place

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.820
to house this massive
cultural monument.

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.640
A more logical place
would be Vienna.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.730
But Hitler hated Vienna.

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.810
Vienna was the city that
rejected him as an artist.

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.300
He was actually a failed artist.

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.830
He applied to the Vienna
Academy of Fine Arts--

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.090
not once, but twice.

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.190
And he was rejected both times.

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:21.140
So he wanted to diminish the
cultural importance of Vienna

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.180
as a city.

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.540
He felt that, by putting
it in his hometown of Linz,

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.160
that Linz would become the Third
Reich's capital for the arts.

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:37.610
And eventually, it would become
the cultural capital of Europe.

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.780
While Hitler applied
for admission

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.760
to the Vienna Academy, one
of the members of the board

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.050
felt sorry for him.

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:53.810
And they told him that he had
some talent in architecture.

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.720
So perhaps he should go
on to become an architect.

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.850
He obviously never did that.

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:01.610
But he did put his
architectural training

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:06.230
to use in that he made
architectural drawings

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.900
of the Fuhrer museum.

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.650
Then he got an actual architect
to create a scale model, which

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:15.590
is what you're looking at here.

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:20.130
This picture was taken
in March of 1945.

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:24.620
Hitler committed suicide
in April of 1945.

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:28.250
So by this time, it was
obvious that the Nazis

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:30.650
were going to lose the war.

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:34.160
But Hitler was still
obsessed with the idea

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.085
of creating this Fuhrer museum.

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:43.040
Part of this obsession as
well was to fill the museum

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:50.240
and fill it with the greatest
treasures of the Western world.

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.390
He hired someone for
the specific purpose

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:58.970
of acquiring art to fill the
museum, a man named Hans Posse.

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:02.240
He had credentials, because
he was the former director

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.640
of the Dresden gallery.

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:09.500
And Posse's mission
was to acquire art

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:14.100
from all over Europe to
fill the Fuhrer museum.

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.280
Not only that,
but Hitler created

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.030
a mandate, telling all
state and party officials

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:26.330
that they needed to assist
Dr. Posse in his mission.

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:31.580
As a result, the Nazis looted
art from every territory

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:34.670
that they occupied.

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:39.290
Now, this isn't anything
new, looting of art.

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:41.270
Through wars throughout
history, it's

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:43.970
always been, to the
victor, the spoils.

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:47.490
Pillaging has gone on for ages.

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:53.360
But what makes this different is
that it was highly systematic.

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:57.380
The Nazis actually had
looting organizations.

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:00.980
These organizations
employed hundreds of people.

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:02.930
There were art experts.

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:06.410
There were people that would
come in and take things out

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:08.360
of other people's houses.

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:10.070
There were record keepers.

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:14.510
The Nazis kept very good
records, believe it or not.

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:17.120
And ironically, this
is what the Allies used

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:22.466
and what we use today
to help find looted art.

00:06:22.466 --> 00:06:25.900
It was actually very
prestigious to be

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:29.920
a member of this organization.

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:33.580
There were several
high-ranking Nazi officials

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:37.390
that considered themselves
not just great art collectors

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:40.160
but art connoisseurs as well.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.730
So if you were in a
looting organization

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:44.950
and you could create
a pipeline of art

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:48.040
to the likes of
Goering or Goebbels,

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:54.220
you would be in good
stead with Nazi elite.

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:57.020
The Nazis drew up lists
of what they wanted,

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:59.110
even before the war.

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:02.740
They targeted both public
and private collections.

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:04.180
And they aimed high.

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:07.330
They targeted the
Louvre in Paris

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:10.480
and the Reich's
Museum in Holland.

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:13.030
In terms of private
collections, they

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:16.120
targeted families that were
known throughout Europe

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:19.190
as having amazing
private collections,

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:23.590
such as the Rothschilds
and the Rosenbergs.

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:26.830
But the Nazis
didn't stop at art.

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:31.270
They stole just about anything
that you could think of.

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:32.950
They stole books.

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:35.050
They stole musical instruments.

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:36.085
They stole wine.

00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:43.240
Here is a picture of bells that
the Nazis stole from churches

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:46.390
throughout Europe.

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:49.810
Many of these bells have
been damaged beyond repair,

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:52.750
because the Nazis didn't
quite know how to store these.

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:55.360
As you can see, I don't
think it's a very good idea

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:57.580
to stack bells one
on top of the other.

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:04.170
Whatever the Nazis
didn't want, they sold.

00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:07.240
They sold this to
fund the war effort.

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:10.360
In fact, the Dorotheum
auction house in Vienna,

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:15.180
which still exist today,
was a Nazi clearing house.

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:18.900
If you look at all Dorotheum
records from this time,

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:23.100
you can see how the Nazis
went into somebody's home.

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:25.780
They listed everything
in their house.

00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:28.230
They started with the
most valuable things

00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:34.230
in the house such as paintings
or sculptures and jewelry.

00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:37.860
And they went down
the list and included

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:42.059
intimate personal items
that nobody would really

00:08:42.059 --> 00:08:44.230
want to buy such as underwear.

00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:47.315
But these were still
on the list of sales.

00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:54.900
The Nazis ended up amassing
hundreds and thousands

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:57.040
of works of art.

00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:00.750
And they needed places
to store all of this art.

00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:03.480
One of the key places
that they chose

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:07.140
was in the musee de
Jeu de Paume in Paris.

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:10.890
Have any of you been
to the Jeu de Paume?

00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:15.910
This is what it looked like
when it was a Nazi repository.

00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:17.670
And if you look
through this, you

00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:20.580
can almost play, spot
the famous artist.

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:24.030
We have Degas over here.

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:26.460
We have a Léger here.

00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:31.380
There's a Picasso
here, and on and on.

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:33.750
What was really
interesting about this

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:37.650
was Reich's marshal,
Herrmann Goering,

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:42.810
came to the Jeu de Paume 20
times in the course of the war.

00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:46.590
Goering was an
obsessive collector.

00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:50.460
But he considered himself not
just a collector, a connoisseur

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:51.780
as well.

00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:55.440
When Hitler would send in
his dealers to get things,

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:59.640
Goering liked to come in
and look at the works of art

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:02.790
and touch them and make sure
that they were personally

00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:06.560
sent to his castle in Bavaria.

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:09.330
And so here we have the
head of the Luftwaffe,

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:15.080
who should be spending his
time thinking about the war.

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:17.180
But instead, he's spending
an inordinate amount

00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:20.060
of time obsessing about art.

00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:27.490
As the Allies gained
favor during the war,

00:10:27.490 --> 00:10:32.190
the Nazis literally went
underground to hide art.

00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:35.520
And they hid art in salt mines.

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:41.130
Believe it or not, salt mines
were ideal for storing art.

00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:43.120
First of all, they
were underground.

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:47.010
So they were protected
from bombing.

00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:50.890
Second of all, they
were cool underground.

00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:51.630
It was cool.

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:52.690
It was dark.

00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:53.460
It was dry.

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:56.790
So you didn't have to
worry about fluctuations

00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:59.270
in temperature or humidity.

00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:01.380
And you didn't have to
worry about sunlight

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:03.990
destroying the works of art.

00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:09.460
There are two salt mines that
I want to take a look at.

00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:13.800
The first one is in
Merkers, Germany.

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:15.630
When the Allies
came in here, they

00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:21.870
found art from more than a
dozen German state museums.

00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:25.020
Here is a picture of
General Eisenhower.

00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:27.960
Behind him is General Patton.

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:31.680
And you can see they're
looking through stolen art.

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:35.040
This picture was
taken the same day

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:38.520
that General Eisenhower
went to a concentration camp

00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:40.350
for the first time.

00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:43.840
And he became sick
to his stomach.

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:46.080
What's really interesting
about this photograph

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:48.420
is you can see that
the effects of war

00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:50.940
are actually starting
to take their toll

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:54.410
on this great general.

00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:58.745
The other thing that the
Allies found in here was gold--

00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:06.530
literally, tons
and tons of gold.

00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:09.130
So if you see here,
we've got some gold bars.

00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:10.990
And then just bags of gold.

00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:13.660
Gold was stolen from banks.

00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:16.600
Jewelry was taken
and melted down.

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:20.380
But what was most
disturbing was the Allies

00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:25.320
found bags of gold teeth from
victims of the Holocaust.

00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:30.010
We're going to look
at another salt mine.

00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:34.120
It is in Altaussee in Austria.

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:36.340
This has an interesting
story to it,

00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:41.750
because this salt mine was
rigged with explosives.

00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:45.070
The Nazis felt that, if
they couldn't have the art,

00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:46.870
then nobody else should have it.

00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:50.080
So they put bombs all
over the entrance.

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:53.890
We have some unlikely
heroes to the story as well,

00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:58.120
Austrian miners who were
part of the resistance.

00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:02.290
These miners were able to
thwart the Nazi's attempts

00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:06.220
to try to bomb this or explode
this until the Allies could

00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:09.730
come and save the works of art.

00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:12.880
There were some pretty
amazing treasures

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:16.280
that they found in this
particular salt mine.

00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:19.820
So let's take a little
journey, shall we?

00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:25.870
First, you go down a long
tunnel of whole mile deep.

00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:30.130
And what the Allies
found amazed them.

00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:35.950
They found work stations for
cataloging and even restoring

00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:36.550
art.

00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:41.860
And you can see on the wall just
all sorts of paintings here.

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:45.070
There's another
corridor with paintings.

00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:49.900
In fact, the Allies found
over 6,500 paintings.

00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:52.360
The majority of
these were earmarked

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:55.092
for the Fuhrer museum.

00:13:55.092 --> 00:13:58.120
And I do want to look
at a couple of paintings

00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:02.932
that the Allies found,
because they're pretty famous.

00:14:02.932 --> 00:14:03.940
Right over here.

00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:05.200
This is a Frans Hals.

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:07.720
But it's this one
I want to look at.

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:12.280
That is called "The
Astronomer" by Johann Vermeer.

00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:16.570
Here it is in all
its beautiful glory.

00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:19.060
Vermeer was a Dutch master.

00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:23.170
He only painted 34 works of art.

00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:28.450
Every single one of
these is a masterpiece.

00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:32.140
Every now and again, you'll hear
about a Vermeer being stolen.

00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:33.520
And it's a really big deal.

00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:36.940
Because it's a huge
loss to society.

00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:40.250
And to think that that
could have been destroyed

00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:42.520
is just astounding.

00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:44.110
You can visit this painting.

00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:46.270
It is in the Louvre in Paris.

00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:49.840
And honestly, the slide
does not do it justice.

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:52.750
It's really spectacular.

00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:57.320
The other famous work of art
I want to look at is this.

00:14:57.320 --> 00:15:02.500
Does anybody know what
those panels are from?

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:04.590
The Ghent Altarpiece.

00:15:04.590 --> 00:15:09.720
The Ghent Altarpiece
is this massive altar.

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:12.560
It is 11 by 15 feet.

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:14.140
In fact, here we see it.

00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:18.010
It consists of 12 panels
by another Dutch master

00:15:18.010 --> 00:15:20.920
named Jan Van Eyck.

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:25.041
If you look at it, you could
see all sorts of nice detailing.

00:15:25.041 --> 00:15:25.540
Let me see.

00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:28.580
It was this panel, this
panel, and this panel

00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:31.490
if we go back right there.

00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:35.230
Many people consider
this to be the greatest

00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:38.410
treasure of the western world.

00:15:38.410 --> 00:15:40.390
And it's just shocking
to think that this

00:15:40.390 --> 00:15:41.965
could have been gone forever.

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:45.790
Right.

00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:48.560
That is a bit about the theft.

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:52.300
Now, let's talk about recovery.

00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:57.190
In 1943, the Allies set up
the monuments, fine arts,

00:15:57.190 --> 00:16:03.070
and archives unit, also
known as The Monuments Men.

00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:08.140
This was set up in an effort
to protect monuments from being

00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:10.600
damaged during the war.

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:13.090
So the military
recruited all sorts

00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:17.470
of art historians and
architectural historians

00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:21.340
to point out monuments
of cultural significance

00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:25.180
and make sure that
these monuments were not

00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:27.910
destroyed during bombings.

00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:31.990
This was also done to help
with the war on propaganda.

00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:34.480
The Nazis were
painting the Allies

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:37.270
as barbarians of culture.

00:16:37.270 --> 00:16:39.370
They said that the
Allies would come

00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:43.270
in, the Americas in
particular, and start bombing

00:16:43.270 --> 00:16:45.910
monuments that had been
around for hundreds,

00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:50.050
possibly thousands of
years, without a care

00:16:50.050 --> 00:16:54.940
in the world about their
historical significance.

00:16:54.940 --> 00:17:00.130
The Monuments Men wanted to make
sure that this didn't happen.

00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:03.700
But this wasn't
without controversy.

00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:08.020
There were some monuments that
were in key strategic location.

00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:12.369
So you sometimes
see Monuments Men

00:17:12.369 --> 00:17:16.750
bookish art historians arguing
with five-star generals.

00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:20.710
But for the most part, the
art historians won out.

00:17:20.710 --> 00:17:24.579
And as a result, we still have
all of these famous monuments

00:17:24.579 --> 00:17:27.790
in Europe today.

00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:31.960
The remit of the Monuments
Men was extended when

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:34.630
the war became a ground war.

00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:40.270
And it became obvious
just how massive the scale

00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:42.940
of Nazi looting was.

00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:47.290
So the remit that was changed to
find and recover a looted art.

00:17:47.290 --> 00:17:49.990
But there is another
remit that they had--

00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:52.870
and you don't hear much about
this in the history books.

00:17:52.870 --> 00:17:56.410
And it was to make sure
that Allied soldiers didn't

00:17:56.410 --> 00:18:00.130
take anything home with
them for souvenirs.

00:18:00.130 --> 00:18:03.400
And so on the one hand,
they're trying to return art

00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:04.889
that the Nazis looted.

00:18:04.889 --> 00:18:06.430
But on the other
hand, they're trying

00:18:06.430 --> 00:18:09.370
to make sure that the
Allies don't loot anything.

00:18:09.370 --> 00:18:10.510
And that did happen.

00:18:13.030 --> 00:18:17.290
The Monuments Men collected
vast amounts of data.

00:18:17.290 --> 00:18:21.010
And they were astounded
by just how much art

00:18:21.010 --> 00:18:25.300
was looted throughout Europe.

00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:28.240
This is one of my
favorite slides.

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:31.780
This was taken at a church
in Illingen, Germany.

00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:34.540
And here, we see a soldier.

00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:38.590
And he's completely
overwhelmed by these stacks

00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:43.270
of stolen art two stories high.

00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:45.760
The Allies were
finding repositories

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:48.580
like this throughout Europe.

00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:54.440
In fact, they found
over 1,000 repositories.

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:56.920
So they created their own
central collection point

00:18:56.920 --> 00:19:01.580
to catalog the works and
tried to return them.

00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:05.120
The Allies agreed that
identifiable works of art

00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:07.880
should be returned
to the countries

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:11.560
from which they were taken.

00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:14.780
Here, we have a
picture of looted art

00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:16.760
being returned to Florence.

00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:20.020
You can see there's a bit
of a celebration going on.

00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:21.470
It was just a nice day.

00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:24.540
Everybody's really happy.

00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:28.250
But this is only half the story.

00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:31.610
Once the works of art were
returned to these countries.

00:19:31.610 --> 00:19:35.480
It would then be up to
agencies in the countries

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:40.080
to return the works of art
to their rightful owners.

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:44.150
This is where it gets
more complicated.

00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:47.210
If the works were
from a state museum,

00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:50.880
that's a lot easier, because
those could be returned.

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:54.090
But if they were from
a private collection,

00:19:54.090 --> 00:19:56.880
it becomes very
difficult. First of all,

00:19:56.880 --> 00:20:00.860
they might not know who
the works belong to.

00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:05.030
But even if they did know
who the works belonged to,

00:20:05.030 --> 00:20:08.180
the odds of them actually
finding that person

00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:09.750
were very low.

00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:12.880
A lot of people had
fled the country.

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:18.110
And in the worst cases, people
had perished in the Holocaust.

00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:21.920
As a result, there are
museums all over Europe

00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:25.460
that are holding onto what
are considered [? errorless ?]

00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:27.815
works of art in their museums.

00:20:31.870 --> 00:20:36.960
Let's talk a bit about
contemporary restitution.

00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:41.400
After the war, families filed
claims for missing artworks.

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:42.990
And it wasn't just artworks.

00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:45.880
It was real estate.

00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:47.430
It was jewelry.

00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:49.590
Insurance claims were filed.

00:20:49.590 --> 00:20:52.950
This happened a lot in
the 1940s but started

00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:56.380
dying down in the 1950s.

00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:59.570
This wasn't really the
priority for families.

00:20:59.570 --> 00:21:03.450
The priority was to find
surviving family members

00:21:03.450 --> 00:21:05.220
and get on with their lives.

00:21:07.770 --> 00:21:11.670
The issue pretty much died
down in the latter half

00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:17.190
of the 20th century,
until the 1990s.

00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:18.900
And then all of
the sudden, there

00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:24.030
was a resurgence in
interest in this subject.

00:21:24.030 --> 00:21:29.110
This had to do with more
information becoming available.

00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:32.250
There are three factors
that contributed to this.

00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:35.250
One was the fall of
the Iron Curtain.

00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:38.280
So all of the sudden,
all sorts of information

00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:42.350
from former Eastern Bloc
countries was opening up.

00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:46.050
Two was that 50-year
privacy laws and archives

00:21:46.050 --> 00:21:47.710
were expiring.

00:21:47.710 --> 00:21:50.160
So all sorts of
archival information

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:52.230
was becoming available.

00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:55.540
And three was the
rise of the internet.

00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:59.130
So all of a sudden, people were
putting information online.

00:21:59.130 --> 00:22:01.680
And you could do research
from your computer

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:03.900
instead of having to
travel to archives.

00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:09.870
Conferences were held
throughout the 1990s

00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:16.110
to talk about what to do with
the outstanding looted art.

00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:19.710
This culminated it in a
conference that took place

00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:24.870
in Washington DC in 1998
called, appropriately enough,

00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:29.220
the Washington Conference
on Holocaust Era Assets.

00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:33.090
During this conference,
delegates from 44 nations

00:22:33.090 --> 00:22:37.320
got together and came up
with a set of principles

00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:40.100
of how to deal with looted art.

00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:42.720
And again, they were called,
appropriately enough,

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:45.500
the Washington
Conference Principles.

00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:47.760
It's a lot of text
for one slide,

00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:50.700
so I will summarize it for you.

00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:53.700
Essentially, it
says, every effort

00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:56.970
should be made to
find and return art

00:22:56.970 --> 00:23:00.390
to their pre-war owners.

00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:03.090
It gets interesting again.

00:23:03.090 --> 00:23:07.110
These principles were primarily
written by the US State

00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:08.490
Department.

00:23:08.490 --> 00:23:10.650
And delegates from
Europe weren't

00:23:10.650 --> 00:23:14.100
too pleased with the fact
that America was telling them

00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:18.120
how to deal with European art.

00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:20.550
So in order to make
sure that everybody

00:23:20.550 --> 00:23:26.920
signed these principles,
they were made non-binding.

00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:29.970
So that means, ethically,
you should do the right thing

00:23:29.970 --> 00:23:31.740
and return looted art.

00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:36.396
But legally, you don't have to.

00:23:36.396 --> 00:23:41.850
A follow-up conference
was held in Prague in 2009

00:23:41.850 --> 00:23:43.920
where a similar
set of principles

00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:47.280
was ratified by 46 nations
called the Theresan

00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:48.720
Declaration.

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:51.630
But again, these principles
were non-binding.

00:23:56.910 --> 00:24:00.570
Fortunately, a
substantial amount of art

00:24:00.570 --> 00:24:03.390
has been returned.

00:24:03.390 --> 00:24:06.300
But there are still
thousands of works that

00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:08.700
are out there that are missing.

00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:13.770
The latest estimate is that
there are 350,000 works of art

00:24:13.770 --> 00:24:15.420
that are still at large.

00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:18.120
Families are searching for them.

00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:22.230
And as I mentioned,
museums throughout Europe

00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:24.960
have works in their
collections that they

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:27.300
know were looted by the Nazis.

00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:29.400
In France, for
instance, in museums

00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:33.390
such as the Louvre, the
Pompidou, the D'orsay,

00:24:33.390 --> 00:24:36.720
and other state museum, there
are over 2,000 works of art

00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:38.680
hanging on the walls.

00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:39.960
These have an official name.

00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:44.190
They're called MNRs, or
Musee Nationale Recuperation.

00:24:44.190 --> 00:24:48.060
And they're waiting for families
to come in and claim them.

00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:50.700
In the meantime, they are
considered [? errorless. ?]

00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:54.090
And the states are
displaying them.

00:24:56.650 --> 00:25:00.930
So what do you do if
you are a claimant

00:25:00.930 --> 00:25:05.420
and you want to
search for looted art?

00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:08.290
Probably the easiest
thing to do is contact

00:25:08.290 --> 00:25:09.920
a claimant organization.

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:13.800
There are several good claimant
organizations out there.

00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:16.860
Many of them are
charities as well.

00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:19.580
There are also law
firms that specialize

00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:22.650
in restitution of looted art.

00:25:22.650 --> 00:25:25.440
This was not a
specialty 20 years ago.

00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:29.640
But as high-value works of art
are being returned to families,

00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:32.340
there's a lot of money
involved in this.

00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:37.580
So now, there are law firms
that specialize in this.

00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:42.020
If you don't want to go
through a claimant organization

00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:45.860
or a law firm and do your
own research, what I always

00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:49.130
tell people to do is start
by getting a family history.

00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:53.600
Know what happened to your
family members before the war,

00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:56.360
during the war,
and after the war.

00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:59.420
Then get an idea of
what objects were taken.

00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:02.270
And if you have
any documentation,

00:26:02.270 --> 00:26:05.720
it helps a great deal.

00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:08.030
Documentation can
be photographs,

00:26:08.030 --> 00:26:10.610
photographs especially
of the works in situ.

00:26:10.610 --> 00:26:14.510
I came across a picture of
people looking for a painting.

00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:17.960
And there are these lovely
elderly ladies playing cards

00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:19.820
with this beautiful
painting behind them.

00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:22.040
And that did help.

00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:24.920
There are also paintings that
are left to people in wills.

00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:26.270
So they're mentioned there.

00:26:26.270 --> 00:26:30.310
If they're famous works of
art, they could be in catalogue

00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:33.380
[? raisonnés, ?] which lists
works of art by a particular

00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:39.710
artist, or even past
insurance claims.

00:26:39.710 --> 00:26:42.080
The other thing to do
is, once you find out

00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:45.140
an object is stolen
or looted, register it

00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:48.650
on a stolen art database.

00:26:48.650 --> 00:26:51.620
The biggest stolen art
database is called the Art Loss

00:26:51.620 --> 00:26:53.810
Register.

00:26:53.810 --> 00:26:57.650
And if you are a dealer
or an auction house that

00:26:57.650 --> 00:27:00.900
has a good reputation,
you do your due diligence,

00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:03.410
and you check the
Art Loss Register

00:27:03.410 --> 00:27:06.350
before you sell anything to
make sure the works of art

00:27:06.350 --> 00:27:09.920
are not stolen or looted.

00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:13.840
There are lots and lots of
databases of Nazi-looted art

00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:15.020
now.

00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:17.720
Unfortunately, there isn't
a Google for looted art.

00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:20.420
So you can't look at
everything in one place.

00:27:20.420 --> 00:27:22.830
You do have to
know where to look.

00:27:22.830 --> 00:27:26.980
But hopefully, something
like that will be imminent.

00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:28.670
And one thing you're
probably thinking

00:27:28.670 --> 00:27:32.390
is, OK, let's say you put
something on a stolen art

00:27:32.390 --> 00:27:34.290
database and there's a match.

00:27:34.290 --> 00:27:36.080
Then what happens?

00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:38.570
If it's from a dealer
or an auction house

00:27:38.570 --> 00:27:41.960
and they're reputable,
then they won't sell it.

00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:44.270
But then it becomes
really, really tricky.

00:27:44.270 --> 00:27:46.160
Because for the most
part, the person

00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:49.280
who is putting it up for
sale bought the work of art

00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:50.750
in good faith.

00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:53.120
And they feel really
bad for the family

00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:54.440
that this was looted from.

00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:55.820
But they're thinking, well, yes.

00:27:55.820 --> 00:27:56.600
This is horrible.

00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:58.400
But I paid good
money for this, and I

00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:00.410
had no idea it was looted.

00:28:00.410 --> 00:28:02.480
Then on the other hand,
you have the family

00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:05.900
that wants to get back a
piece of their heritage.

00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:10.880
So you start to talk about
some sort of settlement.

00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:12.920
And settlements can be tricky.

00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:14.160
And they can take a while.

00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:17.390
Usually, they take
several years to try

00:28:17.390 --> 00:28:19.910
to get both parties to
agree on something that they

00:28:19.910 --> 00:28:22.880
can both be happy with.

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:25.550
Now, it is complex,
searching for looted art.

00:28:25.550 --> 00:28:29.240
But it is something that
happens as is evidenced

00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:31.760
by all these cases
that we've seen

00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:35.330
in the last 10 to 20 years.

00:28:35.330 --> 00:28:38.810
OK, well, that brings us to
the third part of the lecture

00:28:38.810 --> 00:28:42.620
where I'm going to talk
about a restitution case

00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:46.060
that my family was involved in.

00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:48.560
It is a work by an artist
named Egon Schiele.

00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:51.110
It's called "Portrait of Wally."

00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:53.960
This was a landmark case.

00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:57.590
It's changed the way
that museums looted art.

00:28:57.590 --> 00:29:03.050
And it's also caused Austria
to create a restitution law.

00:29:03.050 --> 00:29:05.600
This was one of the
first major cases

00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:09.080
to put Nazi looting
in the headlines.

00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:11.510
Prior to that, a lot
of people didn't even

00:29:11.510 --> 00:29:14.940
know that the Nazis looted
art, me being one of them.

00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:16.354
I had no idea.

00:29:16.354 --> 00:29:18.770
And then when I found out that
this happened to my family,

00:29:18.770 --> 00:29:20.930
I became really
interested in this

00:29:20.930 --> 00:29:24.440
and started working
in the field.

00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:31.910
My great great aunt was an
art dealer in 1930s Vienna.

00:29:31.910 --> 00:29:34.460
Her name was Leah [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:36.050
She owned her own gallery.

00:29:36.050 --> 00:29:39.020
And she championed modern art.

00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:41.270
And in many respects,
it's very forward.

00:29:41.270 --> 00:29:45.560
Because you don't have too many
female gallery owners in 1930s

00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:46.640
Vienna.

00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:50.030
And there aren't too many
that championed modern art.

00:29:50.030 --> 00:29:57.020
She dealt in works by Klimt,
by Schiele, and by Kokoschka.

00:29:57.020 --> 00:30:00.800
She owned quite a few
works by Egon Schiele.

00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:06.500
But by far, her favorite
was "Portrait of Wally."

00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:11.150
In 1938 in Austria,
Anschluss occurred.

00:30:11.150 --> 00:30:16.280
And the fate of Jewish
families changed dramatically.

00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:20.010
All Jews were ordered to
give up their businesses.

00:30:20.010 --> 00:30:24.460
So my aunt had to hand her
business over to a Nazi.

00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:29.390
A Nazi named Friedrich
Feltz acquired her gallery.

00:30:29.390 --> 00:30:31.910
And he came to her
house one day to get

00:30:31.910 --> 00:30:34.640
her to sign some paperwork.

00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:38.090
He saw "Portrait of Wally"
hanging on her wall.

00:30:38.090 --> 00:30:40.040
And he said, I want that.

00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:41.420
Give it to me.

00:30:41.420 --> 00:30:43.610
And she said, no,
you can't have it.

00:30:43.610 --> 00:30:44.480
It's mine.

00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:47.660
It has nothing to
do with my gallery.

00:30:47.660 --> 00:30:50.540
It's part of my
personal collection.

00:30:50.540 --> 00:30:52.490
He said, I don't care.

00:30:52.490 --> 00:30:54.170
Give it to me.

00:30:54.170 --> 00:30:57.570
They argued for
a good half hour.

00:30:57.570 --> 00:31:01.700
And finally, her husband
said, just give it to him.

00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:04.650
You know what he's capable of.

00:31:04.650 --> 00:31:08.900
So reluctantly, she handed
"Wally" over to him.

00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:11.030
And one of the things
that he was capable of

00:31:11.030 --> 00:31:13.400
would be revoking
their exit visa.

00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:18.290
So they fled for
London the next day.

00:31:18.290 --> 00:31:20.660
When my aunt moved to
London, she actually

00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:24.530
set up own gallery here in
London, another modern art

00:31:24.530 --> 00:31:25.400
gallery.

00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:28.130
And she was actually one of
the first people credited

00:31:28.130 --> 00:31:33.920
for bringing German and Austrian
expressionism to the UK.

00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:38.480
After the war, she started
searching for "Wally"

00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:43.760
and she found that it was in
the Belvedere museum in Vienna.

00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:47.120
The Belvedere was the
Austrian state museum.

00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:49.430
So my aunt wrote the museum.

00:31:49.430 --> 00:31:51.980
She explained the
circumstances of loss.

00:31:51.980 --> 00:31:54.680
And she asked for
her painting back.

00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:57.420
What do you think
the museum said?

00:31:57.420 --> 00:31:57.920
No.

00:31:57.920 --> 00:31:58.955
You've can't have this.

00:31:58.955 --> 00:32:00.860
This belongs to us.

00:32:00.860 --> 00:32:02.210
Sorry.

00:32:02.210 --> 00:32:03.440
She wrote letters.

00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:05.510
She hired lawyers.

00:32:05.510 --> 00:32:10.160
But she had no luck.

00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:15.560
In 1953, a young
Viennese ophthalmologist

00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:22.040
named Rudolf Leopold sought
her out in her London gallery.

00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:27.350
Leopold was obsessed
with Egon Schiele.

00:32:27.350 --> 00:32:31.520
He thought that he was the
reincarnation of Schiele.

00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:34.820
He touched up works by
Schiele even though he didn't

00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:38.150
have any artistic training.

00:32:38.150 --> 00:32:43.040
His goal was to amass
the largest collection

00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:47.060
of works by Schiele ever.

00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:50.570
He knew my aunt's reputation
as a dealer in works

00:32:50.570 --> 00:32:52.250
by Egon Schiele.

00:32:52.250 --> 00:32:56.945
So he asked her to help
him find works by Schiele

00:32:56.945 --> 00:32:59.780
to build his collection.

00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:01.580
She said she would.

00:33:01.580 --> 00:33:06.560
But in return, could he help her
get back "Portrait of Wally"?

00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:08.840
He said that he would.

00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:13.430
She hadn't heard from
him for a little while.

00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:19.620
Then the next thing she knew,
he ended up owning "Wally."

00:33:19.620 --> 00:33:21.230
Again, she wrote letters.

00:33:21.230 --> 00:33:25.850
She hired lawyers
but to no avail.

00:33:25.850 --> 00:33:29.930
She died in 1969 having
never gotten back

00:33:29.930 --> 00:33:31.100
her beloved portrait.

00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:39.910
The story is not over.

00:33:39.910 --> 00:33:43.390
Let's fast forward to 1997.

00:33:43.390 --> 00:33:48.400
By this time, Leopold had
amassed the largest collection

00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:50.860
of works by Egon
Schiele in the world.

00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:54.700
In fact, he has his own museum
in Vienna called the Leopold

00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:55.750
museum.

00:33:55.750 --> 00:33:56.950
Have any of you been there?

00:34:00.970 --> 00:34:04.940
In 1997, he agreed to
loan several key pieces

00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:08.090
from his collection to
the Museum of Modern Art,

00:34:08.090 --> 00:34:10.620
or MoMA in New York.

00:34:10.620 --> 00:34:12.080
This was a big deal.

00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:16.820
Schiele was becoming a very
fashionable artist by then.

00:34:16.820 --> 00:34:20.750
And this was the first time
that so many works by Schiele

00:34:20.750 --> 00:34:23.520
would be seen on that
side of the Atlantic.

00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:27.949
So it helped to raise Schiele's
reputation as well as the worth

00:34:27.949 --> 00:34:31.790
of the Leopold collection.

00:34:31.790 --> 00:34:34.460
Several key pieces include
a "Portrait of Wally."

00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:36.860
There was another piece
called "Dead City."

00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:38.960
All sorts of amazing
works were going

00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:41.360
to be seeing for the first time.

00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:43.699
Our family decided
the best thing to do

00:34:43.699 --> 00:34:48.590
was to talk to the press
about how Leopold acquired

00:34:48.590 --> 00:34:51.050
works of art in his collection.

00:34:51.050 --> 00:34:54.320
"Portrait of Wally" was
not the only looted work

00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:56.290
of art in his collection.

00:34:56.290 --> 00:35:00.590
And Leopold used less
than upstanding methods

00:35:00.590 --> 00:35:03.440
to acquire a lot of works.

00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:07.000
So we spoke to a reporter
from "The New York Times."

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.560
And she ended up
writing this big article

00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:12.680
about how Leopold
used dastardly methods

00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:14.760
to acquire works of art.

00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:16.190
They interviewed my family.

00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:17.780
They focused on two paintings--

00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:20.900
"Portrait of Wally"
and "Dead City."

00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:26.840
When the article came out,
it caused a sensation.

00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:30.950
Citizens of New York, Jewish
citizens in particular,

00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:36.320
were aghast that MoMA
would harbor Nazi loot.

00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:38.870
So we took this
opportunity to contact

00:35:38.870 --> 00:35:42.110
the chair of the
Museum of Modern Art

00:35:42.110 --> 00:35:45.570
to see if he could
keep Wally in America

00:35:45.570 --> 00:35:47.630
before it went
onto its next stop

00:35:47.630 --> 00:35:50.900
in the exhibition,
which was Barcelona.

00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:54.140
We knew that, if it left
America and we couldn't

00:35:54.140 --> 00:36:00.890
prove the ownership in America,
we would never get it back.

00:36:00.890 --> 00:36:04.240
The chairman for the Museum
of Modern Art at the time

00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:07.370
is a man named Ronald Lauder.

00:36:07.370 --> 00:36:08.840
You might not have heard of him.

00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:13.580
But you have heard of
his mother, Estee Lauder.

00:36:13.580 --> 00:36:17.090
Ronald Lauder has a
lot of ties to Austria.

00:36:17.090 --> 00:36:22.310
He was the Austrian
ambassador in the 1980s.

00:36:22.310 --> 00:36:24.980
He was also, or is
also, an avid collector

00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:29.640
of Austrian expressionist art
such as Klimt and Schiele.

00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:32.960
In fact, the rumor is that
he used his bar mitzvah

00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:37.260
money to buy an Egon
Schiele painting.

00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:41.750
Not only that, but he
chairs a recovery company

00:36:41.750 --> 00:36:46.340
that helps Jewish families
get back works of lost art.

00:36:46.340 --> 00:36:50.270
So we thought he would be
sympathetic to our plight.

00:36:50.270 --> 00:36:51.890
But guess what?

00:36:51.890 --> 00:36:54.620
He wouldn't help us.

00:36:54.620 --> 00:36:58.550
He was indebted to
the museum community

00:36:58.550 --> 00:37:02.420
and making sure that this
work went to its next stop

00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:04.040
on the exhibit.

00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:08.240
While this was going on, museums
were taking notice of this.

00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:12.080
In fact, all sorts of
museums wrote a joint letter

00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:17.120
saying that MoMA had to move
this painting to its next stop

00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:18.800
in the exhibition.

00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:21.560
This is because
museums were realizing

00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:24.110
that, if this work
stayed in America

00:37:24.110 --> 00:37:26.990
and there was an investigation
into the provenance

00:37:26.990 --> 00:37:30.230
or ownership history
of the work of art,

00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:33.380
if they owned works abroad,
other families could

00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:37.010
claim for looted art as well.

00:37:37.010 --> 00:37:39.620
I'm going to let you
in on a little secret.

00:37:39.620 --> 00:37:43.100
Museums do not like to
give back works of art

00:37:43.100 --> 00:37:45.590
from their collections.

00:37:45.590 --> 00:37:49.850
My feeling is, if these museums
consider themselves paragons

00:37:49.850 --> 00:37:53.210
of culture, they wouldn't
want stolen or looted

00:37:53.210 --> 00:37:56.760
art in their collections
in the first place.

00:37:56.760 --> 00:37:59.915
But that was not the way that
these museums felt at the time.

00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:05.060
We spoke to lawyers.

00:38:05.060 --> 00:38:08.060
We spoke to government
organizations

00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:10.221
about keeping the
work in the country.

00:38:10.221 --> 00:38:11.720
And they were all
trying to help us.

00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:14.330
But things were looking bleak.

00:38:14.330 --> 00:38:16.430
In fact, "Wally" was
getting packed up.

00:38:16.430 --> 00:38:19.630
And it was getting
ready to be shipped off.

00:38:19.630 --> 00:38:23.090
But at the 11th hour, the
Manhattan District Attorney

00:38:23.090 --> 00:38:27.170
swooped in and subpoenaed the
painting under the US Stolen

00:38:27.170 --> 00:38:29.750
Property Act.

00:38:29.750 --> 00:38:35.060
As you could well imagine,
officials at MoMA were livid.

00:38:35.060 --> 00:38:38.810
Officials at the Leopold
museum were livid.

00:38:38.810 --> 00:38:41.900
A lawsuit ensued.

00:38:41.900 --> 00:38:45.170
Now, during this lawsuit, a
couple of interesting things

00:38:45.170 --> 00:38:46.490
happen.

00:38:46.490 --> 00:38:50.720
Museums began looking through
artworks in their collections

00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:54.260
and looking for gaps in, again,
the provenance or ownership

00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:59.010
history from the
years 1933 to 1945.

00:38:59.010 --> 00:39:01.350
And they would place
these works online

00:39:01.350 --> 00:39:04.840
so that people could
begin researching them.

00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:06.540
The other thing
that happened was

00:39:06.540 --> 00:39:10.320
that Austria was getting
a bit of a bad reputation

00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:12.390
for having looted art.

00:39:12.390 --> 00:39:18.570
And the culture minister in
her knowledge and wiseness

00:39:18.570 --> 00:39:20.640
decided that this
was just really

00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:24.060
not a good way for
Austria to be perceived

00:39:24.060 --> 00:39:26.610
and wanted to make
a big gesture.

00:39:26.610 --> 00:39:29.190
So they ended up
writing a law saying

00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:31.200
that, works of art
that were looted

00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:34.230
by the Nazis that were
in Austrian museums

00:39:34.230 --> 00:39:36.240
would be returned.

00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:38.850
Unfortunately, "Wally"
was exempt from that,

00:39:38.850 --> 00:39:43.860
because the Leopold museum
was not fully a state museum.

00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:49.730
So this lawsuit went
on for 12 long years.

00:39:49.730 --> 00:39:55.800
Finally, in June of 2010, we
came up with a settlement.

00:39:55.800 --> 00:40:00.480
The Leopold museum ended up
paying our family $19 million

00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:04.850
for the painting, which was
the market price at the time.

00:40:04.850 --> 00:40:09.530
And they would get to display
it again in the Leopold museum.

00:40:09.530 --> 00:40:13.830
But there would be a plaque
next to it stating the ownership

00:40:13.830 --> 00:40:17.230
history and my aunts role in it.

00:40:17.230 --> 00:40:20.620
Just a couple of other pictures.

00:40:20.620 --> 00:40:24.430
This is Egon Schiele's
self-portrait

00:40:24.430 --> 00:40:25.840
with Chinese red lanterns.

00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:29.860
And this was what he
painted as a companion piece

00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:31.330
to "Portrait of Wally."

00:40:31.330 --> 00:40:36.140
Those two are now hanging
together in the Leopold museum.

00:40:36.140 --> 00:40:41.710
And this is a painting of my
aunt by a Hungarian artist

00:40:41.710 --> 00:40:45.860
named Felix [? Harta. ?] In
talking to family members,

00:40:45.860 --> 00:40:49.540
the general consensus is, if
she'd known all the fuss made

00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:53.661
over her little painting, she
would have laughed at laughed.

00:40:53.661 --> 00:40:54.160
All right.

00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:55.243
Well, that is the lecture.

00:40:55.243 --> 00:40:57.830
Hopefully, I've helped to
demystify this a little bit.

00:40:57.830 --> 00:41:00.818
And I'm happy to
answer any questions.

00:41:00.818 --> 00:41:04.241
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:12.570 --> 00:41:13.580
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:41:13.580 --> 00:41:16.460
I'm just wondering if this has--

00:41:16.460 --> 00:41:18.800
immediately what
comes to mind is

00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:21.800
art that's been sort of
looted through the centuries

00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:23.450
through war--

00:41:23.450 --> 00:41:25.329
basically, everything
in the Louvre.

00:41:25.329 --> 00:41:26.870
SHAUNA ISAAC: And
the British Museum.

00:41:26.870 --> 00:41:28.419
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:41:28.419 --> 00:41:29.710
So I'm just wondering if this--

00:41:29.710 --> 00:41:31.430
I mean, I understand
this is more recent.

00:41:31.430 --> 00:41:35.960
It's probably a different set
of circumstances to a degree.

00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:39.620
But I would imagine this
is also impacting norms

00:41:39.620 --> 00:41:41.020
for those works of art.

00:41:41.020 --> 00:41:42.920
So just wondering if
you can talk about that.

00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:43.711
SHAUNA ISAAC: Sure.

00:41:43.711 --> 00:41:46.370
Yeah, well, in the
UK, for example,

00:41:46.370 --> 00:41:50.540
it is illegal to deaccession
works of art from museums.

00:41:50.540 --> 00:41:52.220
So that means you
can't give them back

00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:54.500
unless there's an
act of Parliament,

00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:58.610
which is why the Elgin Marbles
have not been given back.

00:41:58.610 --> 00:42:03.020
There have been exception for
Holocaust-looted art, which

00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:04.580
you can give it back.

00:42:04.580 --> 00:42:07.940
They put a sunset
clause in it, which is

00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:09.551
going to be ending very soon.

00:42:09.551 --> 00:42:11.300
You might have even
seen that in the news.

00:42:11.300 --> 00:42:13.460
Somebody's government
officials said

00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:15.860
that they were not going to
put a sunset clause in it.

00:42:15.860 --> 00:42:17.870
There won't be a
statute of limitations.

00:42:17.870 --> 00:42:20.090
But somebody's
trying to block that.

00:42:20.090 --> 00:42:23.420
And this seems to be the
case with a lot of museums

00:42:23.420 --> 00:42:24.890
throughout Europe.

00:42:24.890 --> 00:42:29.330
AUDIENCE: Are there any
rules on when claimants

00:42:29.330 --> 00:42:31.910
are trying to claim
any artwork back

00:42:31.910 --> 00:42:37.410
on what they wish to do
with the art going forward,

00:42:37.410 --> 00:42:39.000
if that makes sense?

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:40.460
SHAUNA ISAAC: Yeah.

00:42:40.460 --> 00:42:43.760
My feeling is, once
they get the art back,

00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:45.170
they could do
whatever they want.

00:42:45.170 --> 00:42:47.460
Sometimes that's part
of the settlement.

00:42:47.460 --> 00:42:50.600
And a lot of people think, well,
you fight so long and so hard

00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:52.790
to give back or get
back these works of art.

00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:55.730
Why are you then turning
around and selling them?

00:42:55.730 --> 00:42:57.600
There are a couple
of reasons for that.

00:42:57.600 --> 00:43:01.640
One is because oftentimes
it's just one work of art.

00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:02.930
And there are a lot of errors.

00:43:02.930 --> 00:43:04.580
You can't divide
up the work of art.

00:43:04.580 --> 00:43:06.920
But you can divide up money.

00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:13.830
Two is that, if it is a work
of art worth a lot of money,

00:43:13.830 --> 00:43:16.040
a lot of families can't
even afford the insurance

00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:16.850
on the art.

00:43:16.850 --> 00:43:19.340
But my feeling is,
once they get it back,

00:43:19.340 --> 00:43:21.235
they can do whatever
they want with it.

00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:28.460
AUDIENCE: Does that
even mean, if they

00:43:28.460 --> 00:43:30.940
want to keep it in their
private collection,

00:43:30.940 --> 00:43:33.809
then there aren't any
rules on that either?

00:43:33.809 --> 00:43:34.850
SHAUNA ISAAC: Absolutely.

00:43:34.850 --> 00:43:36.260
They could do whatever
they want with it.

00:43:36.260 --> 00:43:38.030
They could keep it in
their private collection.

00:43:38.030 --> 00:43:39.080
They could give it away.

00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:40.790
They could hide it
in a vault somewhere.

00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:41.530
It's theirs.

00:43:46.290 --> 00:43:48.520
AUDIENCE: Are the
differences between art

00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:51.430
that was looted by
individuals and there

00:43:51.430 --> 00:43:54.160
was in the more sort of
state-sponsored looting,

00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:56.740
in terms of recovery,
are there big differences

00:43:56.740 --> 00:43:58.960
in the way you see people
trying to provide evidence?

00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:00.418
It must be much
more difficult when

00:44:00.418 --> 00:44:02.850
it was a person who just
saw something they liked

00:44:02.850 --> 00:44:05.020
and to go off the
wall and it didn't

00:44:05.020 --> 00:44:07.619
go into the sort of Nazi
administration system.

00:44:07.619 --> 00:44:08.410
SHAUNA ISAAC: Yeah.

00:44:08.410 --> 00:44:10.600
Oftentimes, it is
a lot easier when

00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:13.870
it is something that's gone
through the state system

00:44:13.870 --> 00:44:16.960
than when it's a person.

00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:20.500
And the rules and laws for
the countries are different.

00:44:20.500 --> 00:44:23.740
So somebody might be
living in one country

00:44:23.740 --> 00:44:26.479
and find a work of art
that's in another country.

00:44:26.479 --> 00:44:28.770
And you're dealing with
different laws in each country.

00:44:28.770 --> 00:44:31.780
So that's where it gets very
tricky and very complicated.

00:44:31.780 --> 00:44:34.420
And it's like that with
individuals versus states

00:44:34.420 --> 00:44:34.960
as well.

00:44:37.189 --> 00:44:37.730
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:44:37.730 --> 00:44:38.229
Thanks.

00:44:38.229 --> 00:44:40.310
That was really,
really interesting.

00:44:40.310 --> 00:44:42.762
It sounds like there
was an opportunity back

00:44:42.762 --> 00:44:45.220
in the past from your slides
that whether the international

00:44:45.220 --> 00:44:48.202
community could have come
together and made binding rules

00:44:48.202 --> 00:44:48.910
and didn't do so.

00:44:48.910 --> 00:44:50.493
And then you gave a
couple of examples

00:44:50.493 --> 00:44:53.750
how individual countries
created rather restricting rules

00:44:53.750 --> 00:44:55.390
on actually
preventing-- maybe this

00:44:55.390 --> 00:44:56.931
happened even in
the Austrian example

00:44:56.931 --> 00:44:59.740
where there's a loophole
in there that [INAUDIBLE]..

00:44:59.740 --> 00:45:02.710
Are there any plans
to create sort of more

00:45:02.710 --> 00:45:04.390
international binding rules?

00:45:04.390 --> 00:45:06.984
And if not, do you have any
hope that there will be?

00:45:06.984 --> 00:45:08.650
SHAUNA ISAAC: Funny
you should ask that.

00:45:08.650 --> 00:45:12.640
I was at a conference in
September here in London.

00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:16.320
And there were government
officials from,

00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:18.490
gosh, I don't know,
Austria, Germany,

00:45:18.490 --> 00:45:20.590
the Netherlands, the UK.

00:45:20.590 --> 00:45:22.994
Somebody brought
up the question of,

00:45:22.994 --> 00:45:24.910
are we going to make the
Washington Conference

00:45:24.910 --> 00:45:26.620
Principles binding?

00:45:26.620 --> 00:45:28.960
They couldn't say,
no, fast enough.

00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:33.340
And there are actually
legitimate reasons for that.

00:45:33.340 --> 00:45:35.470
It's good to have
this as a framework.

00:45:35.470 --> 00:45:38.170
But then each country
has its own laws.

00:45:38.170 --> 00:45:42.040
And they want to work
within their own laws.

00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:47.330
But in terms of making some
sort of binding legislation,

00:45:47.330 --> 00:45:49.470
I don't hold out
much hope for that.

00:45:52.179 --> 00:45:52.970
AUDIENCE: Hi there.

00:45:52.970 --> 00:45:58.400
When was the last time a large
shipment or amount of artwork

00:45:58.400 --> 00:45:59.480
has been found in caves.

00:45:59.480 --> 00:46:01.490
Because you read a lot of
the news that people think

00:46:01.490 --> 00:46:02.656
they found "The Amber Room."

00:46:02.656 --> 00:46:04.820
And they're in the mines
somewhere in Germany.

00:46:04.820 --> 00:46:07.230
But has there been-- recently
in the past five years,

00:46:07.230 --> 00:46:10.520
are people still finding
salt mines worth of artwork?

00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:13.670
And do you have any hope
that they're still out there?

00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:18.530
SHAUNA ISAAC: You hear
about Nazi trains.

00:46:18.530 --> 00:46:21.290
But for the most part,
those end up being false.

00:46:21.290 --> 00:46:25.610
The last big, big, big
stack of looted art

00:46:25.610 --> 00:46:30.530
was discovered was
in 2012 I believe

00:46:30.530 --> 00:46:31.700
with the Gurlitt collection.

00:46:31.700 --> 00:46:34.970
Have you heard about that?

00:46:34.970 --> 00:46:39.080
Cornelius Gurlitt was the son
of a notorious Nazi dealer.

00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:41.271
German customs
officials were wondering

00:46:41.271 --> 00:46:43.520
why he had so much money
when they saw him on a train.

00:46:43.520 --> 00:46:45.290
They went to his flat
in Munich, and they

00:46:45.290 --> 00:46:50.870
found over 1,200 works of
art in his flat in Munich.

00:46:50.870 --> 00:46:56.150
That was probably the last
massive haul that was found.

00:46:56.150 --> 00:46:57.920
AUDIENCE: What sort
of condition those--

00:46:57.920 --> 00:46:59.878
SHAUNA ISAAC: They're in
pretty good condition.

00:46:59.878 --> 00:47:02.110
In fact, they are on
exhibit right now.

00:47:02.110 --> 00:47:04.230
There's two exhibits going on.

00:47:04.230 --> 00:47:09.260
There's one in Bern, because
for some convoluted reason,

00:47:09.260 --> 00:47:10.400
Gurlitt passed away.

00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:13.980
And he left all these works
to the Klimt's museum, Bern.

00:47:13.980 --> 00:47:16.910
So it Bern is during
an exhibition now.

00:47:16.910 --> 00:47:18.770
And there's also
one that, I believe,

00:47:18.770 --> 00:47:20.750
just closed in Bonn, Germany.

00:47:20.750 --> 00:47:23.990
But it's going to reopen
in Berlin in September

00:47:23.990 --> 00:47:26.060
if you wanted to visit them.

00:47:26.060 --> 00:47:28.550
The hope is that families
will come forward and claim

00:47:28.550 --> 00:47:30.810
these works of art.

00:47:30.810 --> 00:47:31.570
So we'll see.

00:47:31.570 --> 00:47:33.870
Some of are very valuable.

00:47:33.870 --> 00:47:36.720
Some aren't that valuable.

00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:40.040
But it did cause a huge
stir when this came up.

00:47:40.040 --> 00:47:43.280
And there are also restitution
researchers in Germany

00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:45.980
who are going through
the provenance of all

00:47:45.980 --> 00:47:48.206
of these objects trying to
determine whether or not

00:47:48.206 --> 00:47:48.830
they're looted.

00:47:48.830 --> 00:47:51.200
Because Gurlitt said that
none of these were looted

00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:54.636
and they were all
acquired legitimately.

00:47:54.636 --> 00:47:56.510
And there have been a
few claims made on them

00:47:56.510 --> 00:47:59.020
and people have gotten back
works of art from there.

00:48:01.182 --> 00:48:03.140
AUDIENCE: I was just
wondering if there's maybe

00:48:03.140 --> 00:48:06.080
a positive or negative
correlation between the type

00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:08.960
of artist versus a
gallery looking to recover

00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:10.470
a certain type of artist.

00:48:10.470 --> 00:48:13.930
Does that have a positive
effect or a negative effect

00:48:13.930 --> 00:48:15.665
would you say?

00:48:15.665 --> 00:48:17.040
SHAUNA ISAAC: It
seems like there

00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:21.690
are some artists that tend to
be looted more than others.

00:48:21.690 --> 00:48:23.880
Most of them would
be modern artists

00:48:23.880 --> 00:48:27.030
such as Klimt and Schiele.

00:48:27.030 --> 00:48:29.970
And it depends on who
you're talking to as to

00:48:29.970 --> 00:48:32.410
whether or not it's a
positive or negative effect.

00:48:32.410 --> 00:48:34.950
And how many of you have seen
the movie, "Woman in Gold,"

00:48:34.950 --> 00:48:39.960
with the Klimt painting that was
restituted to the era of Adele

00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:41.730
Bloch-Bauer?

00:48:41.730 --> 00:48:44.114
That was a really positive
effect for the family

00:48:44.114 --> 00:48:45.780
and for the lawyer
that worked with her.

00:48:45.780 --> 00:48:47.760
But it had a really
negative effect

00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:51.790
on the Belvedere which had
to give all these works back.

00:48:51.790 --> 00:48:56.124
So I think it really depends
on who you're talking to.

00:48:56.124 --> 00:48:58.290
AUDIENCE: Were the works
that Hitler was collecting,

00:48:58.290 --> 00:49:00.060
were they the same
ones that he was sort

00:49:00.060 --> 00:49:01.700
of condemning as degenerate?

00:49:01.700 --> 00:49:02.670
SHAUNA ISAAC: No.

00:49:02.670 --> 00:49:04.950
No, the works that
Hitler was condemning

00:49:04.950 --> 00:49:07.320
as degenerate were either
going to be destroyed--

00:49:07.320 --> 00:49:08.820
but fortunately,
the Nazis realized,

00:49:08.820 --> 00:49:11.530
oh, hey, we can sell
these works of art.

00:49:11.530 --> 00:49:15.390
The types of work that Hitler
and, by association, the Nazis

00:49:15.390 --> 00:49:19.380
liked were Renaissance
works, works

00:49:19.380 --> 00:49:22.440
that were ancient
Greek or ancient Roman.

00:49:22.440 --> 00:49:25.830
You could show
nudity, but it would

00:49:25.830 --> 00:49:28.120
have to be nudity
without sensuality.

00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:32.345
So they were much more
provincial type of works.

00:49:32.345 --> 00:49:34.420
AUDIENCE: So was Schiele
one of the degenerates?

00:49:34.420 --> 00:49:35.128
SHAUNA ISAAC: No.

00:49:35.128 --> 00:49:37.590
Schiele would have been
a degenerate big time.

00:49:37.590 --> 00:49:41.610
So Sheila, Klimt,
Kokoschka, Picasso, Chagall.

00:49:41.610 --> 00:49:43.490
They were all considered
degenerate artists.

00:49:43.490 --> 00:49:46.284
And I could give a whole
other lecture on that.

00:49:46.284 --> 00:49:47.700
AUDIENCE: So Hitler
was condemning

00:49:47.700 --> 00:49:48.900
all of those degenerates.

00:49:48.900 --> 00:49:53.410
And yet all of his sort of
high-ranking sort of officials

00:49:53.410 --> 00:49:55.940
were collecting
them on the side?

00:49:55.940 --> 00:49:57.210
SHAUNA ISAAC: Some were.

00:49:57.210 --> 00:49:59.100
It's always more
complicated than that.

00:49:59.100 --> 00:50:01.590
Some were collecting modern art.

00:50:01.590 --> 00:50:03.550
Some were big fans
of modern art.

00:50:03.550 --> 00:50:07.470
But when the decrees went down
that this type of modern art

00:50:07.470 --> 00:50:09.570
was labeled
degenerate, the Nazis

00:50:09.570 --> 00:50:13.274
couldn't openly collect that.

00:50:13.274 --> 00:50:14.190
AUDIENCE: Interesting.

00:50:14.190 --> 00:50:15.602
Thank you.

00:50:15.602 --> 00:50:16.560
With that, we'll close.

00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:17.490
Thank you so much, Shauna.

00:50:17.490 --> 00:50:18.035
That was fascinating.

00:50:18.035 --> 00:50:19.000
SHAUNA ISAAC: It's my pleasure.

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:19.600
Thank you.

00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:22.950
[APPLAUSE]
