Gah! Cavity Sam here is not doing so great.
He's got junk in his body that definitely

00:00:07.769 --> 00:00:12.100
should not be there. But, you know, like the
fork and the knife in the belly and the heartburn

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:17.570
and the jackhammer head are easy problems
to fix because Sam's body does not come close

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.390
to the incredible complexity of what's going
on inside of you right now.

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.980
Your body is awesome, literally. The amount
of stuff going on at any given time to keep

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.180
you alive and functioning is awe-inspiring.
Trying to manipulate the tiny little tweezers

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.860
so you can retrieve the nail from poor Sam's
fingers is nothing compared to the challenge

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.889
of just trying to understand the systems that
keep you operating. The human body is composed

00:00:40.889 --> 00:00:45.620
of thousands of intricate pieces of biological
machinery, which is part of why we rely on

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.859
two twin disciplines to talk about it here
on Crash Course: anatomy and physiology. Anatomy

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:55.679
is the study of the structure and relationships
between body parts, while physiology is the

00:00:55.679 --> 00:01:00.339
science of how those parts come together to
function and keep that body alive.

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:04.330
From grave robbers to microscopes, these fascinating
disciplines have come a long way and we are

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.820
still discovering new things about how it
all works. I'm not going to lie to you, it's

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.620
tough. We'll build on things that you learned
in biology and chemistry and you'll learn

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:17.120
more about cell specialization, how your epithelial
tissue creates order out of the mayhem of

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.620
your body, and look at the important protection
you get from your integumentary system. And

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.380
by the end of this course you're gonna understand
more about all of the complicated things your

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.970
body is up to right now while you're sitting
there at home watching this video, and maybe

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.880
you'll appreciate what a wondrous thing that
body of yours truly is.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.940
To be clear, that is not a real x-ray.

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.000
It's Photoshop.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.740
So join us for a new year of Crash Course
where I, Hank Green, talk about all of this...

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:48.020
stuff and hopefully help us all understand
a little more about ourselves with Crash Course:

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.020
Anatomy and Physiology.

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.620
(Game buzzes) Duhh! Homeostasis.
