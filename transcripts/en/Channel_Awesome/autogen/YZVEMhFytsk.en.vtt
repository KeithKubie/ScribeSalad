two I mean they carried into the next
one but they also you know they were

00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:05.830
one but they also you know they were
 

00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:06.840
one but they also you know they were
self explanatory they were

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:06.850
self explanatory they were
 

00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:09.540
