[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.608 --> 00:00:08.510
ABE HASKINS: My
name is Abe Haskins.

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:10.420
I'm a developer
programs engineer

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.130
at Google on the Firebase team,
and I'm here with my friends

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:15.920
Larry and Lisa from the
Google Assistant team.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.370
And today we're going to be
talking about building games

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:23.030
for mobile and audio on Google.

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:24.530
This is going to
be a two part talk.

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:26.840
So the first part is going
to be all about mobile,

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.635
building games for mobile
with Google technology.

00:00:29.635 --> 00:00:31.010
And then the second
part is going

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.170
to be all about building
audio games on the Google

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.049
Assistant using all of our
cool technology for that.

00:00:37.049 --> 00:00:38.840
So we're going to get
started, like I said,

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.720
with the mobile aspect of
the game or of the talk.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.430
And we're going to dig into
building mobile games on Google

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.260
via Firebase.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.350
To get some general idea
of who we're talking to,

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.660
how many people have
heard of Firebase,

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.120
have some idea of what it is?

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.510
All right, so about half.

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.489
That's pretty good.

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:00.780
We're going to talk about a
handful of different things

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.113
to make sure that everyone's
on the same page about what

00:01:03.113 --> 00:01:04.860
Firebase is, and then
we'll talk about it

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.100
in a little more depth what
the value is in your game,

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.150
how you can use it, and
what best you can do.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.210
So our agenda for my part of
the talk, the first half hour,

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.380
is going to be first--

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.360
what is Firebase?

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.200
What were we thinking at
Google when we made this thing?

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.890
Second, who is Firebase for?

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.160
Is it something for
small game developers?

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.150
Is it something only
for mobile developers?

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.750
Is it something
for gigantic apps?

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.215
We'll answer all
those questions?

00:01:32.215 --> 00:01:33.840
And then third, we'll
talk about what's

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.620
happening in Firebase today,
what we've been doing recently,

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.060
what we just recently
announced, and maybe

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.680
a bit about what's upcoming.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.360
So first off, what is Firebase?

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.460
What is Firebase
on a high level?

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.180
And I'm going to generally stay
on a fairly high level for most

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:50.170
of Firebase.

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.525
And the reason is that
Firebase is a very big thing.

00:01:53.525 --> 00:01:55.900
If I wanted to go into detail
about every single feature,

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.070
we would be here
for the rest of GDC,

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.270
and there is a lot of other
cool stuff here to see.

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.010
So in a simple sense,
Firebase is a platform

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:07.930
to help you build your game.

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.810
It's a platform to help
you grow your player base.

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.680
And it's a platform to
help you make more money.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.266
And what this really looks
like is this big chart

00:02:17.266 --> 00:02:18.640
of a bunch of
different features.

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.190
These are the 15 different
Firebase features

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.500
that come together to
make this platform.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.760
And depending on who you are,
if you are a technical engineer,

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.394
or if you are a marketing
person, or a business person,

00:02:30.394 --> 00:02:32.560
different parts of this is
going to connect with you

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.310
in different ways.

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:34.768
If you're an
engineer, you're going

00:02:34.768 --> 00:02:36.760
to say, all right,
Firebase authentication.

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.170
I have some idea
of what that is.

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.710
But you might not be as
interested in the AdWords

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:41.650
integration.

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.750
And this is because
Firebase as a platform

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.840
is designed to help you grow
throughout the entire life

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:47.870
cycle of your business.

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.840
So if you're a small
business, you're early on,

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.929
you're building your
game for the first time,

00:02:51.929 --> 00:02:54.220
you're going to be really
interested in the development

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:55.516
features of Firebase.

00:02:55.516 --> 00:02:56.890
If you're a little
farther along,

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.473
you've released the
game, you're going

00:02:58.473 --> 00:03:00.460
to want to grow your userbase.

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.550
That's where the
growth pieces come in.

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.880
And if you're a little farther
along, you have some users,

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.770
and you want to start
making a ton of money,

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:11.440
that is where these earning
features are going to come in.

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.840
And we'll cover all of
these in a bit more depth.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.410
But before that, I want to
talk a bit about the philosophy

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.220
of Firebase and what
this platform means

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.589
in terms of the mindset you get
in when you're using Firebase.

00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:26.380
You see here, we have
all of these features

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.930
that I've talked about, all
the different elements in those

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.460
develop, grow, and earn pillars.

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:34.210
But in the core, we
have Firebase Analytics.

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:36.430
And it is the core of
this graphic, obviously.

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.760
But it is also a
core as a philosophy.

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.520
What this means is that
analytics as a concept,

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.440
knowing your users
and understanding

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.590
what they are doing, is really,
really important to building

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.240
a product people love.

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.490
But most analytics
solutions stop

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:54.480
short of giving you
something actionable.

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.550
You can listen to what people
are doing, and you can see,

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:00.010
and you can watch them,
but a lot of times

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.890
it doesn't actually result
to changes in that experience

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:04.390
for those users.

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:07.060
And that's kind of
defeating the point.

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.400
So when we were thinking
about building Firebase,

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.990
we realized that
analytics had to be

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:13.090
the core because all
of these features

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.577
tie back to that analytics core.

00:04:15.577 --> 00:04:17.410
So if you're logging
in with authentication,

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.260
we should use that to
enrich our analytical data.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.140
If you're in the growth phase
and you want to tweak things,

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:24.700
you should be able
to say, all right,

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.070
this audience cares
about this feature.

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:30.040
Let's make it more prominent
in our app for them.

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.947
If we're doing something
with Firebase notifications,

00:04:32.947 --> 00:04:34.780
you should be able to
target those audiences

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:36.780
and you should be able
to create funnels and all

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.460
of these things related to
every single Firebase feature

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.130
connecting back to analytics.

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:46.900
And on a technical level,
that's what this analytics

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.400
in the center means.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.530
But when we're really
thinking about it,

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:52.330
analytics as a
core what it means

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.005
is that your player
is your focus.

00:04:55.005 --> 00:04:56.380
If you're building
with Firebase,

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:58.210
you're building
with a mindset that

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.340
says, everyday,
everything I'm building,

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.260
I'm focusing on my user.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.570
And I am building them
an experience where

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:08.200
they are empowered and
they feel like the boss

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.760
because that's what
they should do.

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.980
If you are the main
player of a game,

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:13.840
it's an experience about you.

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.280
You're interacting
with the world,

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.840
and you might not always
be the king of that world

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:22.150
or in the biggest house
in the entire land.

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:26.100
But you know that that
experience is for you.

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:27.350
And Firebase lets you do that.

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:28.725
It lets you tailor
things, and it

00:05:28.725 --> 00:05:30.770
lets you act on
that analytical data

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:34.420
that Firebase Analytics
is giving you.

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:36.760
Again, I can't really talk
about every single one

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.050
of these features in-depth.

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:39.940
It would take too much time.

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.160
But on a high level,
the categories

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:43.300
are important to remember.

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:44.800
We have features
for development,

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.070
learning and growing.

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:48.010
And then, any given
one of these features,

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:51.490
you can go jump into online
and find documentation about.

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:55.480
And I'll talk about some of
them in a bit more depth.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:58.860
So with that more depth,
let's dig into that.

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.170
What is Firebase on
a technical level?

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:03.080
I've just told you
what our goal is

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.960
and when we were creating this
why we made it the way we did.

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.950
But I didn't actually
say what it was.

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:11.550
And what Firebase is is
both a client-side SDK

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:13.770
and a bunch of cloud services.

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:17.040
These cloud services are
a bunch of things we host

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:17.740
and we control.

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:21.150
So if you're familiar with
other cloud providers,

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:23.700
you may be just thinking, all
right, I go into the cloud,

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:25.174
and I spin up a VM.

00:06:25.174 --> 00:06:27.090
And then I still have
to write a bunch of code

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:29.970
to expose this
service to my user,

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:32.250
to my client in
a reasonable way.

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:33.780
Firebase isn't like that.

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:37.590
There's a ton of things on
that graph that everyone needs.

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:38.970
Everyone needs authentication.

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:41.190
There are very, very
few apps in the world

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:43.060
that don't log in a user.

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:45.510
And so the fact that
people, again and again,

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:48.985
are rewriting authentication
code just doesn't make sense.

00:06:48.985 --> 00:06:50.360
You have to worry
about security.

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:53.220
You have to worry about all
of these little facets that

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:55.350
just waste your time.

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:57.450
And I'll come back
to this in a minute,

00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:00.360
but this is just another type
of focusing on your users,

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:03.570
not diverting your focus
into technical decisions,

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:05.220
not saying, all right,
how are we going

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:06.360
to secure these passwords?

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:08.430
You don't have to think
about that with Firebase.

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:10.890
Since we control the servers,
we control the communication

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:11.660
to the servers.

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:14.160
You can trust that Google is
using the best of our knowledge

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.990
to make this secure,
and safe, and scalable,

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:20.340
so you just don't have
to think about that.

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:24.880
When I say the client SDKs, I
mean a bunch of client SDKs.

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:27.120
These SDKs get
embedded in your game.

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:30.750
And as a bit of history,
when we started Firebase,

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:32.580
we were mostly a
web-focused company.

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:34.720
Way back in the day,
five, six years ago,

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:38.160
something like that, we started
with building JavaScript SDKs.

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:41.430
Over time, we released native
SDKs for Android and iOS

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:44.790
for people building
apps and games natively.

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:49.190
And just recently, last
year, we released as a beta,

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:52.050
our C++ and Unity SDKs.

00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:54.300
And these have just went
into general availability.

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:56.910
In other words, we are
very confident they're

00:07:56.910 --> 00:07:58.956
rock solid and
usable for you today.

00:07:58.956 --> 00:08:01.080
So if you're interested
and you're building in C++,

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:03.380
or you're building in unity,
you can drop these SDKs

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:07.890
into your game right now and
be very confident in them.

00:08:07.890 --> 00:08:11.550
On the cloud side, the
server infrastructure

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:13.530
is all powered by Google Cloud.

00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:15.720
And Google Cloud is
Google's infrastructure

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:17.850
as a service tool that
lets you build out

00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:19.480
crazy, crazy complex things.

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:22.575
So if you were building
a very advanced MOBA,

00:08:22.575 --> 00:08:24.810
and everyone wanted to
come play your game,

00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:28.200
and you had millions and
millions of users every second,

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:30.690
you'd probably want to
look at Google Cloud.

00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:32.835
That's a very specific use case.

00:08:32.835 --> 00:08:34.710
And it's something that
Firebase isn't really

00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:35.939
looking at supporting.

00:08:35.939 --> 00:08:37.980
There's a ton of general
things in that situation

00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:39.406
that Firebase would
help you with.

00:08:39.406 --> 00:08:41.280
But if you're going
really advanced, and more

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:44.700
specifically, really specific,
you can look at Google Cloud.

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:47.550
And when we were looking
at building Firebase,

00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:49.800
we decided to build
on Google Cloud, one,

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:52.110
so that we can say we're
building on the things that we

00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:55.380
expose to you-- so you can use
the exact same tools we do--

00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:57.570
but also because
we knew it really

00:08:57.570 --> 00:09:00.070
was a great platform,
which had the scalability

00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:01.830
and the stability that
we wanted to bring

00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:04.320
to you because the cloud service
doesn't have much benefit

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:05.690
if it's always falling over.

00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:09.570
And we definitely did not
want that with Firebase.

00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:13.020
So who is Firebase really for?

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:17.610
This concept of cloud providers
is something that, in general,

00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:21.511
depending on who you are,
it might seem really scary.

00:09:21.511 --> 00:09:23.760
I mean, I think in general
it's actually really scary.

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:26.220
People think is
it going to scale?

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:27.420
Is it going to grow with me?

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:29.730
Or am I going to hit
a point where Firebase

00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:31.890
doesn't work for me anymore?

00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:34.050
And this goes back to
the scalability part

00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:35.050
of Google Cloud.

00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:37.800
We really, really wanted
to build a solution that

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:39.510
would keep growing with you.

00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:42.510
So if you were 10 people, or if
you were a company with 1,000

00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:44.910
people, if you add 10
users or 100 million,

00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:47.430
we wanted Firebase to be
able to keep up with you

00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:50.220
so you wouldn't have
to be concerned.

00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:52.440
Like I said, there are
features and situations

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:54.780
where if you wanted something
super, super specific,

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:56.870
we can help you grow
into Google Cloud.

00:09:56.870 --> 00:10:00.360
But Firebase itself is designed
to scale incredibly, incredibly

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:01.500
well.

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:04.980
And beyond that, beyond
the technical part,

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:06.750
Firebase is always
for people who

00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:09.390
want to focus on their users.

00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:10.890
Like I said before,
this isn't just

00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:13.460
a focus of tailoring
experiences.

00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:14.850
Tailoring an
experience is great.

00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:16.380
That's super
important to building

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:18.430
a game that connects with
people, tweaking things

00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:20.430
and letting them experience
a game in a way that

00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:22.080
feels all their own.

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:25.170
But it's also about,
as a business,

00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:27.120
where are you
putting your focus?

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:28.920
At the end of the
day, as a gamer,

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:32.730
I don't care what cloud
provider is supporting my game.

00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:35.805
I really don't care if it's on
AWS, if it's on Google Cloud,

00:10:35.805 --> 00:10:37.170
if it's on any other service.

00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:40.440
It doesn't make a difference
to me as the player.

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:42.120
But what does make
a difference is

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:47.500
how much love got put into the
experience that I'm playing.

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:51.660
And if you have 10 people,
you have only so much time,

00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:53.730
and you have only so
much time to dedicate

00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:54.720
to technical decisions.

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:57.630
You have only so much time
to dedicate to gameplay

00:10:57.630 --> 00:11:00.000
and to designing an experience.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.170
And by allowing us the ability
to control the servers,

00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:07.260
to do all your operations, to do
all of these other things that

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:10.830
come with running servers,
we ensure that you do not

00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:12.150
have to think about that.

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:14.610
We give you more time to
focus on your core experience.

00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:16.140
Although none of
these things are

00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:19.380
tools which generally
directly relate to game play,

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:22.770
they'll all improve it
by giving you back focus.

00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:24.960
And that focus comes
to the user and lets

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:29.640
them have a really beautiful
experience in your game.

00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:32.140
And again, we can see all
of these features, all

00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:33.840
of these tieback analytics.

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:37.260
Every single one of these is
small, and understandable,

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:40.650
and usable, but it's
a huge, huge time sink

00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:41.464
to do on your own.

00:11:41.464 --> 00:11:43.380
Real-time database is a
great example of this.

00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:45.270
So Firebase real-time
database is something

00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:48.720
that if you have, for example,
a matchmaking system where

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:51.510
you just want to say, I'm
available for a match.

00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:54.060
And anyone else can say,
I'm interested in a match,

00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:55.590
and you can get paired up.

00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:57.970
In general, that's a very
complicated thing to make.

00:11:57.970 --> 00:11:59.260
That is definitely nontrivial.

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.260
And you would have to
spend a significant amount

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:04.140
of engineering effort building
up real-time communication

00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:06.270
layers, and trying
to scale sockets,

00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:08.590
and dealing with a
lot of complexity.

00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:10.091
But with the real-time
database, you

00:12:10.091 --> 00:12:11.381
don't have to worry about that.

00:12:11.381 --> 00:12:13.750
You can import our client,
you can start writing data,

00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:16.470
you can start receiving updates
to all of your other players.

00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:18.180
And you can do
that in a way that

00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:20.160
is just very simple,
very understandable,

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:21.990
and feels natural
in your environment.

00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:22.950
That's a very important part.

00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:24.408
We want everything
to feel natural.

00:12:24.408 --> 00:12:27.480
So if you're building C++,
it'll feel natural, Unity,

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:31.400
it will feel natural
for you as a developer.

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:34.200
So if we add Firebase
Analytics-- which is the core,

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:36.100
so it's a great starting place--

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:40.240
to our game, this is the
code we have to write.

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:41.840
You'll realize it's
not a lot of code.

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:44.080
In fact, it is the
definition of no code.

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:48.130
And this is because Firebase
Analytics, by default, is so

00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:51.280
tailored for mobile
experiences, it knows so much

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:53.476
about what every
mobile developer needs

00:12:53.476 --> 00:12:54.850
and every game
developer is going

00:12:54.850 --> 00:12:58.480
to want that we don't have
to think about forcing

00:12:58.480 --> 00:12:59.800
you to report events.

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:02.930
So there's a ton of things
like opening the app,

00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:05.920
installing the app,
doing an in-app purchase,

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:08.270
recording retention--
all of these things

00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:09.520
you don't have to think about.

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:12.900
Just by including Firebase
Analytics in your game,

00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:15.490
it starts recording all
of that and providing it

00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:16.690
to you in a dashboard.

00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:20.770
So in the simple use case, there
is no code for you to write.

00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:23.609
You drop it in, and
you're good to go.

00:13:23.609 --> 00:13:25.150
In a slightly more
advanced use case,

00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:27.280
you can write a
few lines of code,

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:29.590
but frankly, it would
take you a lot of effort

00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:31.930
to write a lot of
Firebase Analytics code.

00:13:31.930 --> 00:13:35.560
It is a very succinct
SDK that lets you just

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:37.220
report what you need to report.

00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:40.060
So in this case, we're adding
in a custom game event saying,

00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:42.280
I went to this level.

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:44.290
I began playing it.

00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:46.402
And we're recording the
value of that level.

00:13:46.402 --> 00:13:47.860
So I can go back
into my Analytics,

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:50.170
and I can say, all right, this
person started this level five

00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:50.669
times.

00:13:50.669 --> 00:13:52.510
Or more interestingly,
on average,

00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:55.859
people tried this level 22
times before they beat it.

00:13:55.859 --> 00:13:57.400
And that's the type
of insight that's

00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:00.250
super valuable but
incredibly, incredibly cheap.

00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:04.350
It's one line of code to
get that into your game.

00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:06.360
And once we get
that into our game,

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:08.284
we can immediately
start seeing it.

00:14:08.284 --> 00:14:10.200
And this is one of my
favorite, favorite parts

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:13.110
about Firebase Analytics-- is
that in the first few seconds--

00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:15.075
we're not waiting
days to understand

00:14:15.075 --> 00:14:16.450
if our implementation
is correct.

00:14:16.450 --> 00:14:18.075
We're not waiting
days to make sure all

00:14:18.075 --> 00:14:19.990
of our analytics
events are reporting.

00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:22.770
In the first few seconds, you
can go on your development

00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:26.460
device, and you can start seeing
a stream of those events coming

00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:27.250
in.

00:14:27.250 --> 00:14:29.719
So if you're building
a game like this,

00:14:29.719 --> 00:14:30.760
where we have that flow--

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:34.094
I'm recording a level select
event, level beginning,

00:14:34.094 --> 00:14:35.260
if they completed the level.

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.470
So we can see they
restarted there.

00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:39.420
And this is just me
testing on my device,

00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:42.900
but this allows me to know that
all of my tooling is in there

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:44.569
and it's working
as I would expect.

00:14:44.569 --> 00:14:46.110
So I'm not shipping
the game and then

00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:49.050
finding out later that I forgot
to record this type of event

00:14:49.050 --> 00:14:50.430
or we're missing this.

00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:52.336
We know seconds after
we put that code

00:14:52.336 --> 00:14:54.460
in that everything's working
great and everything's

00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:55.422
reporting.

00:14:55.422 --> 00:14:56.880
And the even cooler
part about this

00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:58.830
is that you can see
those built in events.

00:14:58.830 --> 00:15:01.787
All of that stuff that we
know you're going to want,

00:15:01.787 --> 00:15:03.870
it's already in there, and
it showed up here, too.

00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:05.790
So for example, over
in our top events,

00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:07.470
we see a user engagement event.

00:15:07.470 --> 00:15:10.230
And this is just a type of
event that Firebase Analytics

00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:12.510
records for you automatically.

00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:14.710
And down here, we see some
custom user properties.

00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:17.168
And again, these are things
that Firebase Analytics is just

00:15:17.168 --> 00:15:17.990
recording for you.

00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:21.430
And in this case, we know
exactly when we opened our app.

00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:24.040
So for example, I started
this at exactly 5 PM.

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:26.040
And we'll get information
like this, all the way

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:27.977
through, all
automatically reported,

00:15:27.977 --> 00:15:29.310
up until they uninstall the app.

00:15:29.310 --> 00:15:31.800
Hopefully, they will never
get to uninstalling your app,

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:34.140
but if they do, you will
have a complete view

00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:37.110
of the lifecycle of that user.

00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:38.970
And again, we can
obviously dive in here.

00:15:38.970 --> 00:15:39.750
We can see more.

00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:42.750
We can see-- this definitely
came from a Unity player

00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:46.140
activity, so we're 100% sure
this is where it's coming from.

00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:47.220
We get other information.

00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:50.010
We get that level
ID that we logged.

00:15:50.010 --> 00:15:52.050
And we can dig into
this if we want.

00:15:52.050 --> 00:15:53.704
But this is really
for development.

00:15:53.704 --> 00:15:55.620
This is for testing and
making sure everything

00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:56.550
is looking great.

00:15:56.550 --> 00:15:57.790
It's really good at that.

00:15:57.790 --> 00:16:00.720
But we're not going to collect
a bunch of users information

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:02.690
in this way because if
you have a big game,

00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:04.890
it'll just be like crazy,
crazy numbers of events.

00:16:04.890 --> 00:16:07.440
If only we had
something that let

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:09.720
you look at a ton of users
kind of condensed down

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:11.520
into an understandable way.

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:13.380
Well, maybe we do.

00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:15.777
If you go a few hours out,
you've shipped your game,

00:16:15.777 --> 00:16:16.860
you have a good user base.

00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:19.597
So you get a lot
of data rolling in.

00:16:19.597 --> 00:16:21.930
We can see this other really
cool view called the Stream

00:16:21.930 --> 00:16:22.740
View.

00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:24.510
And this is a near
real time view

00:16:24.510 --> 00:16:27.510
of all the data coming
into your analytics.

00:16:27.510 --> 00:16:31.500
In this situation, we're just
showing the geographic heat

00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:34.840
map of where everyone is
and what they're doing.

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:37.800
But we can already see
general trends emerging.

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:40.650
So we can see the majority
of players of this game

00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:42.760
are in that section of the US.

00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:44.590
That could be due
to the time of day,

00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:46.447
or it could be due to whatever.

00:16:46.447 --> 00:16:48.780
But we also see down below
how many people are currently

00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:49.280
in our game.

00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:51.390
In this case, it's 136.

00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:53.880
We can see the top user
properties, so in this case,

00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:55.320
that's just an API version.

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:57.600
But if you were logging
other user properties,

00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:58.830
it could be up.

00:16:58.830 --> 00:17:00.280
Right now the
majority of players

00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:03.720
online are playing because they
want to know about football,

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:06.300
or they're playing because
they're doing this.

00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:10.552
You can see a great
overview here.

00:17:10.552 --> 00:17:11.760
We can also see app versions.

00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:14.400
And if you want, I don't
have details on it,

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:16.301
but you can see
random user snapshots.

00:17:16.301 --> 00:17:18.300
So you can get a view
very similar to that debug

00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:19.923
view for just a random user.

00:17:19.923 --> 00:17:21.839
So if you're curious
about what they're seeing

00:17:21.839 --> 00:17:23.430
and what they're
experiencing, you

00:17:23.430 --> 00:17:28.131
can dive into a specific user.

00:17:28.131 --> 00:17:30.630
So once we're past, that, like
that Dashboard's really cool.

00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:33.699
It's nice to see in real
time what people are doing

00:17:33.699 --> 00:17:35.490
and how they're
interacting with your game.

00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:37.920
But it's not going
to be something

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:42.300
that you can take and
present to a CEO-type person

00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:45.030
or someone who really
cares about this data.

00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:46.110
It's nice to see.

00:17:46.110 --> 00:17:46.960
It's really cool.

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:48.960
It's really insightful,
and you can learn a lot.

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:51.330
But that's not the end result.

00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:53.790
So after a few days of
recording information,

00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:56.160
we get enough data,
we get to see trends.

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:58.804
And we get a whole
bunch of trends.

00:17:58.804 --> 00:18:00.720
We can get a bunch of
this data, all for free.

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:02.553
And in this case, we're
recording everything

00:18:02.553 --> 00:18:05.670
from in-app purchase
revenue to active users,

00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:07.500
and retention
cohorts, information

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:09.540
about the device,
what OS are they on,

00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:11.070
what version are they on.

00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:13.350
This is all information
from your game.

00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:15.960
This is all stuff that
our analytics package

00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:18.690
can pick up and report
for us, which is great.

00:18:18.690 --> 00:18:21.060
But this is kind of where
the magic of Google comes in.

00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:23.268
And this is something that
Google is really great at.

00:18:23.268 --> 00:18:26.910
You probably don't notice,
but Google knows a fair bit

00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:28.440
of information about you.

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:31.200
We really care about
customizing our experiences

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:33.840
for every individual person.

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:35.400
And so if you go
to Google search,

00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:37.530
it's probably different
than my Google search.

00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:39.510
You'd never notice,
but we care a lot

00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:41.190
about customizing
and changing things

00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:42.557
for each individual user.

00:18:42.557 --> 00:18:44.140
And with all this
information we have,

00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:46.020
we thought, well,
wouldn't it be great

00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:49.180
if we could surface some of
that into our analytics tools.

00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:51.981
So they're not just
getting information

00:18:51.981 --> 00:18:53.730
about what people are
doing in their game,

00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:56.790
but they're getting a context
about who these people are.

00:18:56.790 --> 00:18:58.420
So down here on
the bottom right,

00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:00.030
you can see the location.

00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:03.360
And you could maybe speculate
about how we could get location

00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:04.170
from your game.

00:19:04.170 --> 00:19:06.510
We could probably
guess it somehow.

00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:09.810
But that information is actually
coming from Google's knowledge

00:19:09.810 --> 00:19:11.890
database about these people.

00:19:11.890 --> 00:19:14.140
So you'll get information
about where they're located.

00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:16.020
You'll get information
about gender,

00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:19.201
or age, or general
interest categories.

00:19:19.201 --> 00:19:20.700
So you'll get a
bunch of information

00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:22.830
that's not coming from
your app, but that

00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:25.380
helps improve your view of
your players and a better

00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:29.144
understanding because we can
enrich this with Google data.

00:19:29.144 --> 00:19:30.810
That's one of my
favorite magical things

00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:31.851
about Firebase Analytics.

00:19:31.851 --> 00:19:34.920
We just get so much
cool data so cheaply,

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:38.130
and if you were to implement
all this in your app, everything

00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:41.160
we've showed here, it would be
those logged Firebase events.

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:44.220
We do like three events
for our custom level stuff,

00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:46.110
and all of this
comes in for free.

00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:49.320
This is just
dropping in that SDK.

00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:51.230
So how much is this?

00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:52.720
This is a great question, right?

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:54.303
You're probably
thinking this is going

00:19:54.303 --> 00:19:59.580
to be per user model or some
very, very expensive price tag.

00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:03.514
Obviously, it's going
to be super expensive.

00:20:03.514 --> 00:20:05.430
And I wouldn't put all
this dialogue into this

00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:06.888
if it actually was
super expensive.

00:20:06.888 --> 00:20:09.220
Firebase Analytics
is completely free.

00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:12.480
So whether you have 10
users, or 100 million,

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:15.210
it's going to cost you the
same, which is nothing.

00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:17.640
You can log as many
events as you want.

00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:19.530
Well, there are some
restrictions on events,

00:20:19.530 --> 00:20:21.760
but it's not because
you're not paying us.

00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:24.180
It's just some interesting
parts of analytics.

00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:26.670
But you can log tons
of different things.

00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:28.620
You can report a ton
of different data.

00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:31.350
And it is all completely free.

00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:34.020
One of the great things, though,
as we were building Firebase

00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:37.470
and we were thinking about how
to make Firebase Analytics as

00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:40.890
powerful as we possibly could,
we wanted to make it clear

00:20:40.890 --> 00:20:43.380
that every part of Firebase
was working together

00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:47.274
and every part of Google was
working together with Firebase.

00:20:47.274 --> 00:20:48.690
So we were thinking,
all right, we

00:20:48.690 --> 00:20:50.106
have all of these
built-in charts.

00:20:50.106 --> 00:20:52.350
We have all this great
data that we're showing.

00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:55.000
But what if somebody wants
to go a step further?

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.430
What if they're using a tool
like Data Studio, or Tableau,

00:20:58.430 --> 00:21:00.510
or any of these other
great visualization tools,

00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:03.300
and they're used to generating
really detailed reports.

00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:04.890
Wouldn't it be great
if you could do

00:21:04.890 --> 00:21:06.510
that with Firebase Analytics?

00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:08.400
And so we made it so you could.

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:11.820
You can export every single
event out of Firebase Analytics

00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:13.170
directly into BigQuery.

00:21:13.170 --> 00:21:16.462
And BigQuery is a paid service
that's part of Google Cloud.

00:21:16.462 --> 00:21:18.420
So the Firebase Analytics
part of this is free,

00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:20.010
but BigQuery is paid.

00:21:20.010 --> 00:21:23.160
So you can export
every single event.

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:24.970
And when I say
every single event,

00:21:24.970 --> 00:21:27.070
I literally mean
every single event.

00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:29.040
There is not sampling
happening here.

00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:32.820
And it's just a near real time
feed of everything everyone's

00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:34.807
doing directly into BigQuery.

00:21:34.807 --> 00:21:37.140
So if you want to slice that,
and you want to dice that,

00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:39.000
and you want to
understand exactly

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.210
what every single person
in your game is doing,

00:21:42.210 --> 00:21:43.820
you can do that with BigQuery.

00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:45.380
And from here, like I
said, you can take it out

00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:46.713
into a bunch of different tools.

00:21:46.713 --> 00:21:49.350
BigQuery is mostly accessed
through a SQL-like interface,

00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:52.320
but you can pull it out into a
bunch of different tools, all

00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:57.510
designed specifically to deal
with big data sets like this.

00:21:57.510 --> 00:22:00.090
Now, sadly, we're already
pretty far into this,

00:22:00.090 --> 00:22:02.310
and we can't cover all
of Firebase Analytics,

00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:06.240
and we can't cover all
of Firebase for sure.

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:08.220
But we can take a look at it.

00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:12.390
So I want to show you a demo of
a game that actually the people

00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:16.031
who were working on the Firebase
Unity SDK and the C++ SDK put

00:22:16.031 --> 00:22:16.530
together.

00:22:16.530 --> 00:22:19.180
And this is a game
called Mecha Hampster.

00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:22.130
So let me just hop
over to my camera,

00:22:22.130 --> 00:22:26.080
and we'll see my
fantastic phone here.

00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:31.200
So this demo-- if I
can unlock my phone--

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:32.870
is a simple game.

00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:37.290
It's a marble roller style
game, where you explore a world

00:22:37.290 --> 00:22:41.490
and get to the end, which
is always super exciting.

00:22:41.490 --> 00:22:43.740
And this is kind of the
cool part about Firebase--

00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:47.400
is that this idea, this
game, isn't crazy innovative.

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:49.890
It's not something that
we've never seen before,

00:22:49.890 --> 00:22:51.790
but we can make it better.

00:22:51.790 --> 00:22:54.480
We can make it more
interactive, more social,

00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:56.026
by putting Firebase
features in it.

00:22:56.026 --> 00:22:57.900
So right out of the
gate, we have this option

00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:00.330
to create an account,
sign in later.

00:23:00.330 --> 00:23:02.580
This is Firebase authentication.

00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:05.100
Just doing account management
in a general situation

00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:06.480
would require servers.

00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:08.852
It would require a fair
bit of infrastructure.

00:23:08.852 --> 00:23:09.810
But we don't need that.

00:23:09.810 --> 00:23:11.226
So we can go to
create an account,

00:23:11.226 --> 00:23:14.700
and I'll quickly type a--

00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:17.022
that's close enough at--

00:23:17.022 --> 00:23:19.230
luckily, I'm not going to
have to go through the flow

00:23:19.230 --> 00:23:21.570
to actually verify
this [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:21.570 --> 00:23:24.690
It's hard to type like this.

00:23:24.690 --> 00:23:26.310
At, nope.

00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:26.850
Oh, is that?

00:23:26.850 --> 00:23:27.750
That's display name.

00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:28.570
That's my bad.

00:23:28.570 --> 00:23:31.170
I've got a great display name.

00:23:31.170 --> 00:23:34.320
Abe@abe.abe.

00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:35.520
That's a real email address.

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:36.517
I wish.

00:23:36.517 --> 00:23:38.100
And the password--
you can all see it.

00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:39.540
It's hello world.

00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:42.220
Don't log in to
mess with my scores.

00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:44.800
Whoops.

00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:45.780
Interesting.

00:23:53.950 --> 00:23:56.521
WiFi must have
flickered or something.

00:23:56.521 --> 00:23:57.520
We've got into our game.

00:23:57.520 --> 00:24:00.040
We've just signed in with
Firebase authentication.

00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:02.999
And we have access to the
Mecha Hamster Adventure.

00:24:02.999 --> 00:24:04.540
Now, there's a few
components of this

00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:05.350
that I want to walk you through.

00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:06.760
The first one is very simple.

00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:09.359
Let's go play a level.

00:24:09.359 --> 00:24:11.650
And if we were building this
game in a traditional way,

00:24:11.650 --> 00:24:13.330
we would have built
these levels beforehand.

00:24:13.330 --> 00:24:15.621
We would have rolled them up
into the data of our game.

00:24:15.621 --> 00:24:17.080
And we would have
shipped it out.

00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:18.910
But with Firebase,
we have the ability

00:24:18.910 --> 00:24:22.030
to really easily store this
information inside of Firebase.

00:24:22.030 --> 00:24:24.760
So these levels are all stored
in the Firebase real time

00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:25.819
database.

00:24:25.819 --> 00:24:27.610
So as I go through
here, and I roll around,

00:24:27.610 --> 00:24:31.100
and I try to get to the
end very, very well.

00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:33.220
So it looks like I'm
great at this game.

00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:35.990
I know that this level is coming
out of the real time database.

00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:38.419
So if I wanted to add levels,
or I wanted to tweak levels,

00:24:38.419 --> 00:24:40.210
I wouldn't have to
redeploy play this game.

00:24:40.210 --> 00:24:42.293
I could just go out, and
I could edit these levels

00:24:42.293 --> 00:24:43.390
in my database.

00:24:43.390 --> 00:24:44.740
And they'll get pulled down.

00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:47.290
Similarly, if I want
to record high scores,

00:24:47.290 --> 00:24:49.340
I can submit the
score, upload it.

00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:50.940
It turns out I did
not do very well,

00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:52.439
so I only got five
seconds on there.

00:24:52.439 --> 00:24:54.680
But this is also stored
in the real time database.

00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:57.084
So this isn't a crazy new
idea, but it's something

00:24:57.084 --> 00:24:58.750
that generally you
would have had to put

00:24:58.750 --> 00:24:59.833
effort in the servers for.

00:24:59.833 --> 00:25:02.290
You would have had to put
effort into infrastructure.

00:25:02.290 --> 00:25:04.502
And with Firebase, you
just don't have to.

00:25:04.502 --> 00:25:05.960
There's some other
great use cases.

00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:07.780
So since we know
all of our levels

00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:09.826
are stored in the
real time database,

00:25:09.826 --> 00:25:11.200
we can go a step
further and say,

00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:13.660
why don't we just let
people make new levels?

00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:18.030
So we'll go into the editor,
and we'll design up a level.

00:25:18.030 --> 00:25:21.610
It's going to say A for Abe.

00:25:21.610 --> 00:25:23.825
Ab is close enough to Ab.

00:25:23.825 --> 00:25:27.410
We'll put that there,
put an exit over here.

00:25:27.410 --> 00:25:27.910
There we go.

00:25:27.910 --> 00:25:31.460
Let's play that, make
sure that it works.

00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:33.680
Beautiful, great level,
we'll go back to our editor.

00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:36.140
Now we have the ability
to save, share this level,

00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:38.690
send it around, and it's
all stored in the real time

00:25:38.690 --> 00:25:39.900
database.

00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:42.091
Once we get into
saving and sharing,

00:25:42.091 --> 00:25:44.340
we start getting into other
Firebase features, though.

00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:48.470
So Ab is going to be
the name of that map.

00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:49.970
As soon as I upload
this, it's going

00:25:49.970 --> 00:25:52.170
to get published to everyone
who wants to know about it.

00:25:52.170 --> 00:25:53.836
So we're sending out
push notifications.

00:25:53.836 --> 00:25:55.820
We won't get one on
this device, but if you

00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:57.903
had this game installed,
you'd get a thing saying,

00:25:57.903 --> 00:26:00.080
hey, new level has been
released on Mecha Hampster.

00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:01.340
You can go play that.

00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:03.620
If I want, I can click
share, and I can share it out

00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:05.930
to a bunch of different
friends and people like that.

00:26:05.930 --> 00:26:08.060
I sadly have no
friends on this device,

00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:10.010
but if I had recent
contacts, they'd

00:26:10.010 --> 00:26:11.910
be showing up down there.

00:26:11.910 --> 00:26:18.600
Then we can just go ahead and
head back to our main level,

00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:21.690
and we can let people
experience that gain.

00:26:21.690 --> 00:26:24.180
So these are things-- like
I said, this isn't crazy.

00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:26.110
It's not anything ridiculous.

00:26:26.110 --> 00:26:28.035
It's just easier
for you, and it's

00:26:28.035 --> 00:26:30.780
less effort for you to
maintain this game over time.

00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:32.274
It gets taken care
of by Firebase.

00:26:32.274 --> 00:26:34.440
And if something does go
down, if one of the servers

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:36.810
falls over or
anything like that,

00:26:36.810 --> 00:26:41.520
we know that it's going
to come back to Firebase

00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:42.840
to take care of that.

00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:45.569
And it's just a nicer
way to build an app.

00:26:45.569 --> 00:26:47.610
So real quick, let's just
recap what we just saw.

00:26:47.610 --> 00:26:50.160
So we sign in with
Firebase authentication.

00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:51.300
Obviously, no one noticed.

00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:52.800
The player doesn't
notice that we're

00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:53.940
using Firebase authentication.

00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:55.110
They just know they
made an account.

00:26:55.110 --> 00:26:55.860
They made a level.

00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:56.790
That's great.

00:26:56.790 --> 00:26:59.040
Then we use a real time
database to load levels,

00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:00.990
to create a level.

00:27:00.990 --> 00:27:03.510
We use cloud messaging to
send out push notifications

00:27:03.510 --> 00:27:05.100
to everyone who cared.

00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:07.950
And we used Firebase Analytics
to record all of this,

00:27:07.950 --> 00:27:10.566
so we know what
everyone is doing.

00:27:10.566 --> 00:27:11.940
All of this with
without servers,

00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:13.398
all of this without
infrastructure,

00:27:13.398 --> 00:27:15.300
and without cloud,
and everything

00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:17.250
like that that you don't
want to think about.

00:27:17.250 --> 00:27:20.880
All we did as a developer
is include our SDK in there,

00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:26.160
call out to some services,
and let Firebase do its magic.

00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:29.430
So this whole section
is who is Firebase for,

00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:31.620
and the answer is
Firebase is for anyone,

00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:33.630
any game, big or small.

00:27:33.630 --> 00:27:36.300
There's always something in
here that's going to be useful.

00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:38.140
And we looked at that
gigantic chart of all

00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:39.181
these different features.

00:27:39.181 --> 00:27:42.390
And what it comes down to is
that any one of those features

00:27:42.390 --> 00:27:45.570
could be useful to you, but
in all likelihood, all of them

00:27:45.570 --> 00:27:46.470
won't be.

00:27:46.470 --> 00:27:49.990
You won't want to put in all
15 features into your game.

00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:52.380
So if we're forcing you to
include a gigantic SDK you're

00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:55.505
not going to use, it's not going
to be in your best interests.

00:27:55.505 --> 00:27:57.630
So if you only want to use
Firebase authentication,

00:27:57.630 --> 00:27:59.430
if you only want
to use analytics,

00:27:59.430 --> 00:28:02.640
you can drop that in
independent of dynamic links

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:03.990
or remote config.

00:28:03.990 --> 00:28:06.570
You don't have to deal with
those if you don't want to.

00:28:06.570 --> 00:28:09.060
Obviously, you can, and they
all work better together.

00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:11.040
But every individual
component of Firebase

00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:13.740
is designed to be used
alone with the addition

00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:18.720
of the Firebase core,
which is the shared bits.

00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:20.310
So what's upcoming for Firebase?

00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:23.040
What is next in
the Firebase world?

00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:26.460
Well, the Firebase SDK for unity
and C++ is now officially out

00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:27.000
of beta.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.360
It's general availability.

00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:29.970
It's been public
for almost a year,

00:28:29.970 --> 00:28:31.470
but you can go out,
and download it,

00:28:31.470 --> 00:28:35.050
and be very confident in
stability, and everything

00:28:35.050 --> 00:28:35.550
like that.

00:28:35.550 --> 00:28:38.124
We've spent a bunch of time
talking with game developers,

00:28:38.124 --> 00:28:39.540
making sure this
is something that

00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:42.510
really connects with everyone.

00:28:42.510 --> 00:28:46.240
And besides that, there's
a bunch of crazy stuff.

00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:47.340
But here's the thing.

00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:50.490
Firebase is a product
that's always growing.

00:28:50.490 --> 00:28:52.260
We're always working
on cool new things

00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:54.780
because we're working towards
this idea of this platform

00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:56.340
where you will never have
to deal with servers.

00:28:56.340 --> 00:28:58.381
We just don't want you to
have to think about it.

00:28:58.381 --> 00:29:03.460
So since Firebase SDK for unity
and for C++ is relatively new--

00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:06.900
it's just coming into
general availability--

00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:10.900
this is a fantastic time to dive
in and give us your feedback.

00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:12.450
We're still shaping
Firebase today,

00:29:12.450 --> 00:29:14.640
and we want your feedback,
from game developers

00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:18.584
specifically, to know how we
can make this amazing for you.

00:29:18.584 --> 00:29:19.500
We think it's amazing.

00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:20.333
But we want to know.

00:29:20.333 --> 00:29:22.020
And we want to know
what else we can do.

00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:24.414
So if you're interested
in this at all,

00:29:24.414 --> 00:29:25.830
even if you're
thinking, well, I'm

00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:28.520
not quite sure this is
perfect for me, go dive in.

00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:30.720
And please, you can
email me, tweet at me,

00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:33.330
I'll make sure it gets
directly to the team who

00:29:33.330 --> 00:29:35.490
is working on it, so
we can really, really

00:29:35.490 --> 00:29:38.470
make it something that
works great for you.

00:29:38.470 --> 00:29:40.680
So with that, I'm
pretty much out of time

00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:41.970
at exactly 30 minutes.

00:29:41.970 --> 00:29:44.460
I'm going to hand it
over to Lisa and Harry

00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:48.145
to talk about audio-based games.

00:29:48.145 --> 00:29:49.020
Thanks for listening.

00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:52.370
