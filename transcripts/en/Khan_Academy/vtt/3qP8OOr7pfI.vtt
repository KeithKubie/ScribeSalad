00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:03.900
Let's say there's
some company A here.

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.760
And let's think about what
its stock might be doing.

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:08.920
Let's say this is just
over the course of the day.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.740
Let's say its stock is just
trading right over here.

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.780
So as we go through the day,
it's price naturally changes.

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.950
But then right over here-- let's
say this is within the day,

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:21.710
maybe this is happening
at 10AM Eastern

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:33.910
Time-- an announcement comes
out that B intends to acquire A.

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.330
I don't know, let's
say that right now A

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:41.860
is trading at $5 a share,
but a press release comes out

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.790
that B intends to
acquire A at $10 a share.

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:53.710
So you can imagine--
And they say

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.312
they're going to
do it with cash.

00:00:55.312 --> 00:00:57.020
And we'll talk in
future videos about how

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.450
it becomes a little bit
more involved if they're

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:00.241
going to be doing it
with their own shares,

00:01:00.241 --> 00:01:02.240
but they intend to
do it with cash.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.640
So if they're able to
acquire A, everyone

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.790
who owns a share of company
A will get $10 for it,

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.700
and those shares
will go to company

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.790
B. Company B will own
company A all of a sudden.

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.110
So what do you
think would happen

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.630
to the stock of company A?

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.320
We know that B intends to
buy it for $10 a share.

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.320
Well, you could imagine
if everyone thought

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.370
that this is definitely
going to happen,

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:31.190
that anyone who holds the
stock is going to get $10.

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.050
You could imagine that the stock
would just gap up immediately

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:37.910
to something close
to $10 a share.

00:01:40.426 --> 00:01:42.050
And then not even
trade much around it,

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.180
because they know what
they're going to get for it.

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.010
So this is if you knew that
this merger or this acquisition

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.510
was going to happen.

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.270
The reality is, is
that you don't always

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:53.800
know just from
this press release

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.670
that B definitely
will acquire A. Maybe

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.370
they have to get approval
from government bodies

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:01.640
to make sure that they aren't
getting a monopoly here.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.387
Maybe they still have to get
the funding from some bank,

00:02:04.387 --> 00:02:05.970
they still have to
get a loan in order

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:07.930
to be able to do this deal.

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:09.180
Maybe something else happens.

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:11.487
Maybe there's another bidder
who wants to acquire A

00:02:11.487 --> 00:02:12.820
and they're willing to pay more.

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.900
So you don't know
exactly what's going

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.200
to happen in this situation.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.880
So you don't know for sure
this is going to happen.

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.940
So what does normally
happen is that instead

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.190
of going all the way up, it
goes someplace in-between.

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.400
So the reality, instead
of jumping from $5 to $10,

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.200
it might jump from, I
don't know, $5 to $8,

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.500
and maybe it trades around here.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.060
You might say, well,
why does it trade at $8?

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.900
And it would trade
at $8-- so notice,

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.661
if there was 100% chance it
would trade all the way to $10,

00:02:42.661 --> 00:02:44.910
right, because that's what
stock A would be worth now,

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.690
because B is going to pay that.

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.120
But if it trades at $8
essentially the market

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.270
is saying that we're
going to give you 3/5.

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.420
From $5 to $8 is $3.

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.580
So it's giving you 3/5
of the total jump that it

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.262
could have if it
was 100% chance.

00:03:02.262 --> 00:03:04.220
Or another way to say it
is, is that the market

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.070
is saying that there
is a 60% percent

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.720
chance that this
merger will go through.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.260
Anyone who thinks that
there's more than a 60%

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.590
chance-- if they do this
over a bunch of securities,

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.960
so that all the probabilities
kind of work out eventually--

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.750
they should buy this security.

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.790
Because they could buy
at $8, and they think

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.730
it really should be worth $10.

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.970
Anyone who thinks that, no way
that this acquisition is going

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.590
to happen, B isn't going
to get the financing

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.340
or the regulatory
authorities aren't going

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.945
to allow B to do this, then
they should short the stock

00:03:37.945 --> 00:03:38.820
when it goes up here.

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.280
Because if the
acquisition falls through,

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.300
then the stock is going
to go back down here.

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.750
It's going to go back
down to the $5 range

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.100
before the announcement.

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.950
And so people, and
especially hedge funds,

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.170
who act in this way
based on their thinking

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.080
that the merger is
more likely to occur

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.410
or less likely to occur--
based on their research,

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:59.260
or maybe they have some
quantitative models,

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.630
or maybe they have some
information other people don't

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:04.740
have that might be legal
or might be otherwise--

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:06.520
they would place these bets.

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.000
The people who think that
the merger will happen,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.092
will buy expecting
it to go to $10.

00:04:12.092 --> 00:04:14.050
The people who think it
won't, they will short,

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:16.040
expecting it to go to $5.

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.160
And this strategy of playing
the probabilities of a merger

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.320
happening, this is
called merger arbitrage.

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.360
Merger arb, sometimes
called for short.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.320
And it's arbitrage
because someone

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.810
who feels like they know the
merger is going to happen,

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.840
they can buy something
for $8 and then sell.

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.490
Or they could buy
something for $8

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.220
that is going to be worth $10.

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.400
They can sell it for
$10 at some future date

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.120
when B acquires a company.

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.970
Or, if they know the merger
isn't going to happen,

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.800
they can short it for $8
and then buy it back for $5.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.009
Once again, kind of doing
an arbitrage on a price

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:53.550
differential.

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.060
They think something
that's worth $5

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:56.667
is trading at $8
on the down side.

00:04:56.667 --> 00:04:59.000
On the upside, they think
something that's trading at $8

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.080
is worth $10.
