00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.890
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:08.840
&gt;&gt; Abby Nolan: I'm really
honored to introduce to you one

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.670
of the world's great
illustrators of children's books.

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.340
Jerry Pinkney has found
his calling early on

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.910
and was designated
the class artist back

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.730
when he was in elementary school.

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.560
In his career he has worked on
more than 100 children's books

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.560
and won countless awards.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.190
He's adapted lots of fables and
folk tales, including <i>The Tortoise</i>

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:35.170
<i>and the Hare</i>, <i>The Little Red
Hen</i>, and <i>The Lion and the Mouse</i>

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.020
for which he won the
Caldecott medal.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.730
But he has also illustrated
many other types of books,

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.910
and all of them feature beautifully
expressive artwork, playfulness,

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.900
warmth of feeling, and
intriguing details.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.870 position:56%
His latest is <i>In Plain Sight</i>,
which was written by Richard Jackson

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:58.570 position:56%
and captures the sweet relationship
between a man and his granddaughter.

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.260
Mr. Pinkney will be signing
books from 2:30 to 3:30,

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.510
but in the meantime please help
me welcome him to the stage.

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:17.080
[ Applause ]

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.380
&gt;&gt; Jerry Pinkney: Well,
thank you, Abby.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:24.440
And I want to thank certainly
everyone here for attending.

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.380
I mean, isn't this amazing?

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:27.680
It's amazing.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:34.700
And this is probably my fourth time
here at the National Book Festival.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:41.370 position:56%
And I can't tell you, each time that
I enter in this space surrounded

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:49.530
by folks like yourselves, these
bright smiles, and this energy

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.520
that you don't get any other place.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:52.980
So thank you for being here.

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:57.140
Today I'm going to be
presenting my new book,

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.130
a collaboration with
Richard Jackson.

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.040
He wrote the text.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.920 position:56%
And before I do that, though, I want
to talk about the how and the why

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:12.940 position:56%
of how did I happen to actually work
with Dick Jackson on this project

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.800
and what was the pull to
me to illustrate this book?

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.740
Well, each book that I illustrate,
there has to be this opening

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:29.180
that allows me to actually inject
in the project something personal.

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.770
If we go all the way back to my
first book that was published

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:39.970
in 1964, which was <i>The Adventures
of Spider</i>, west African folk tales,

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.940
Anansi the spider, you see the
draw was being a person of color.

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.490 position:56%
So all along what has to be there --
and I'm very blessed and fortunate

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:52.910
to have many, many projects offered

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.600
or that may come my way
-- how do I enter into it?

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.070
Now, if we talk about books that
I've reimagined from my childhood,

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:05.480
the connection certainly
is my childhood.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.710
But in fact, if the
birthing of the text comes

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:14.240
from someone else, how do I enter?

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:15.540
So here we go.

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:20.630
We'll go into <i>In Plain
Sight</i>, again, by Dick Jackson.

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.160
The way it works in publishing is

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:32.390
that a publisher will acquire
a text, a story by an author.

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:37.100
Then the search is to find that
right artist that's appropriate

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.280
for that particular story.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.510
Then the next step is
contacting that illustrator to see

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.610
if in fact he's interested.

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:50.110
Because the value in
illustrating someone else's text is

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.700
that you see value in it, that
you see it's an important project

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.250
for you to do.

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.990
So in this case I get
the text and it's a sort

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:06.930
of not hide-and-seek kind of a
game that a grandfather plays

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.600
with his granddaughter, Sophie.

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:14.110
So I'm looking for
that sort of opening.

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:16.430
What is pulling me to
illustrate this story?

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.780
Well, I have a nine-year-old --

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.790
at the time a seven-year-old
great granddaughter.

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:27.590
And what I thought was kind
of interesting is that --

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:34.280
and I couldn't figure this out,
that even at seven, if I would --

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.300
and they visit with us
often on the weekends.

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:41.620
So if I were to come home a
little later than they arrived

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:47.410
and she knew I was coming in the
door, in that room she'd hide.

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.920
And I couldn't figure
out, you know, at seven,

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:54.140
she's going to be eight soon and
she's still playing hide-and-seek.

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:58.260
And so what touched me in this
particular book, which is a seek

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:05.270 position:56%
and find, is that young Sophie
actually hides from her grandfather.

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:09.490
So I'm going to introduce you to a
little bit about the other things

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:15.230
that lead into why a
project might be important.

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:22.180
So this is supposed to advance.

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:23.480
Okay, all right.

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.560
So this is my studio.

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:33.010
Now, a little bit more history.

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:36.780
The grandfather will hide objects.

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:38.570
So I was thinking about
this as well,

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:40.280
you know, how do I present this?

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:45.440
And I thought, "Why don't I
introduce you into another world

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:49.190
and another connection, my studio?"

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:51.150
And I love to collect.

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:56.810
So there you see my
studio, my drawing table.

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:00.960
By the way, you see that -- that's
a pheasant, which is a mount

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:03.080
that I've been actually
doing drawings of.

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.420
But I'm fascinated with objects.

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:07.750
So you can see that's another pool.

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:11.420
Sophie's grandfather
actually hides objects.

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:13.410
And I love objects.

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:16.970
As a matter of fact, I'm
a little over the top.

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:21.480
This is just a -- it's a
table, and it's a table --

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:25.500
the purpose of this table is
really to hold some of the things

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:27.490
that I'm most interested in.

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:29.870
I love to walk in the woods.

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:34.390
I love feathers, shells,
anything that gives me a sense

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:39.710
of I think it's just the
tactile feel of things.

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:44.680
And if I'm interested in nature,
what better way to introduce nature

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:48.920
into my life, into my studio but
through the collection itself?

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:51.870
So now, here's what
I didn't discover.

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:56.650
Remember I said this story
is sort of a seek and find?

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:59.320
And so went I present --
and I just presented this

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:03.650
to school children the
other day, and it came to me

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:10.070
if we look very closely at
the image, there is a --

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:14.450
got to help me -- there's a
dinosaur -- I'll give you a clue --

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:17.700
that's orange, and then
there's a small rabbit.

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:21.270
Now this was not done on purpose.

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:24.180
Has nothing to do with this
book other than the fact

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:28.090 position:56%
that you can see that's a kind of a
bridge into this story that makes --

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:30.930
because I will oftentimes --
sometimes I use these little,

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:35.110
small animals as research,
as models.

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:37.680
And what I love to
do is just plop them

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:39.950
down anywhere, somewhere
in the studio.

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:43.510
So here we go.

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:45.640
The models.

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:51.190
And I knew in this case
the models would have

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:55.610
to in some way know each other
and relate in order to talk

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:59.480
about this very important
relationship.

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:05.050
So we have here Sophie, and
that's her real grandfather.

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:15.310
Okay. So now, I've set this up
so that you can help me as well.

00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:16.610
That's the room.

00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:19.640
Now, Sophie's grandfather
is wheelchair-bound

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:23.670
and his universe really is
the universe of his room.

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:28.190 position:56%
So we'll talk about maybe at the end
how important it is for me to talk

00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:31.560
about even though his
world is a small world,

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:35.340
he's confined to a wheelchair
so he doesn't leave that room,

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:37.630
he still has powerful interests.

00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:41.370
And also, I want you to watch
out for can you tell something

00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:44.430
about Sophie's grandfather
through looking at the pictures?

00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:46.130
So that's his room.

00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:48.050
I'll give you a little clue.

00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:50.810
You know that there's a banjo case?

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:53.840
Can you we assume that
he's a musician?

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:59.190
Maybe. All right, that's the
title page that you guys know

00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:02.890
that introduces you,
really, to the relationship

00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:09.200
between this powerful
grandfather and the powerful love

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:13.190
that a grandfather has
for his granddaughter.

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:17.050
Okay. Now ready?

00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:19.930
Sophie lives with mama, and daddy,

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:24.720
and grandpa, who lives
by the window.

00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:33.100
He can see Sophie come and go,

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:41.660
call and wave goodbye,
hello as he looks out.

00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:47.030 position:56%
Here's where I need your guys' help.

00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:50.530
And after school each
day, Sophie looks in.

00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:53.360
"Here I am, grandpa," she says.

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:55.470
"How was the morning?"

00:09:55.470 --> 00:10:01.590 position:56%
Surprisingly he says, "I had me a
paperclip, you know, nice and shiny.

00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:03.830
Now it's vanished.

00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:09.240
Help me find it, will you,
with your bright eyes?"

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:12.450
"Where?" says Sophie?

00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:18.480
"That's just it, honey,
you have to look."

00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:31.890
Ah. If you lean close, you
might hear Sophie say, "Oh,"

00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:38.520
and eventually you find you find
you might hear her say, "There."

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:41.100
"Good," says grandpa.

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:43.400
"Thanks honey."

00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:51.330 position:56%
"Here I am," says Sophie on Tuesday.

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:55.760
"Ah, Sophie," he says,
"how was school?"

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:58.290
"Good, it was a blue day."

00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:01.240
"Well, I can see that."

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:04.080
"And how about you, grandpa?"

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:07.790
"Today was regretful.

00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:13.240
Oh, yes. Had me a rubber
band -- stretchy, boing.

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:17.440
Now boing, that band has gone.

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:26.390
Help me find it, huh?"

00:11:26.390 --> 00:11:35.110
And eventually in plain sight,
Sophie finds the rubber band.

00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:40.650
"Here I am, grandpa,"
says Sophie on Wednesday.

00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:43.060
"Was today better?"

00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:46.150
"Not so much," grandpa says.

00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:50.570
"Had me a drinking straw
-- bendy, just right.

00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:51.870
You remember.

00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:54.540
Now it's skedaddled."

00:11:54.540 --> 00:12:00.420
Now, what I want you to do, and I
know it's very difficult for you

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:03.020
to do it here, but
search the image and see

00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:06.160
if you find the drinking straw.

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:10.300
But I'll give you a clue.

00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:11.600
It's on the window frame.

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:12.980
So the idea of the
book is, of course,

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:17.940
you'll go back and forth with that.

00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:19.940
"I'll look," says Sophie.

00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:24.230
I wonder, and eventually
in plain sight.

00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:27.460
"Good girl," grandpa says.

00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:32.940 position:56%
"Thanks." Now, you notice
something else is happening here is,

00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:38.770
of course, is the days of the week.

00:12:38.770 --> 00:12:43.780
On Thursday Sophie says,
"Here I am, grandpa.

00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:45.610

00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:48.120
The other thing you'll
notice, he had this feeling

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:51.570
that maybe Sophie is
in on this game.

00:12:51.570 --> 00:12:53.260
You think so?

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:56.010
On Thursday Sophie says,
"Here I am, grandpa.

00:12:56.010 --> 00:12:57.590
Anything missing?"

00:12:57.590 --> 00:13:03.320
"Well, wouldn't you know
grandma's favorite painting brush

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:06.130
for water colors, child.

00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:08.040
I'm missing that.

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:09.940
Can you help me?

00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:14.650
Lovely." "I can try," says Sophie.

00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:20.890
And eventually, in plain sight.

00:13:20.890 --> 00:13:25.390
So I don't know how well
you guys are doing on this,

00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:31.290 position:56%

eyes may be a little keener, right?

00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:33.510
"Here I am, grandpa."

00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:36.290
What day is it now?

00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:37.590
&gt;&gt; Friday.

00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:39.350
&gt;&gt; "Here I am, grandpa,
Friday at last."

00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:43.890
"You bet, honey," he says,
turning his smile to her.

00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:47.160
But wait, just look.

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:51.190
"Oh, grandpa, you silly."

00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:53.860
"Keep the dollar, Sophie.

00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:58.630
Tomorrow," he says, "you can
buy yourself something with it."

00:13:58.630 --> 00:14:02.020
So did you guys ever try to
put a dollar in your sort

00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:04.890
of eye socket between your eyebrow?

00:14:04.890 --> 00:14:06.190
I tried it.

00:14:06.190 --> 00:14:07.490
You've tried it?

00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:09.650
Yeah, were you successful?

00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:12.070
Yeah, I had a hard time with that.

00:14:12.070 --> 00:14:20.910
Anyway. "So here I am,
grandpa," Sophie says.

00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:22.990
"Early today."

00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:24.290
"No shopping?

00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:28.330
Well, best to save that
dollar, I guess, for college.

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:29.790
Now, let's see.

00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:33.070
Okay. Had me a what?

00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:36.470
A lemon drop -- delicious
to think of --

00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:40.930
but then it just trotted
off unlicked."

00:14:40.930 --> 00:14:43.820
"Don't tell me, grandpa."

00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:54.950
And eventually, in plain sight.

00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:57.910
"Good girl," says grandpa.

00:14:57.910 --> 00:15:08.540
"No, no, you have it, Sophie."

00:15:10.570 --> 00:15:19.470 position:56%
Sunday morning, as usual, at his
door Sophie starts to say, "Grandpa,

00:15:19.470 --> 00:15:24.890
here I" -- but mama hushes her.

00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:29.870
He's sleeping, which
gives Sophie an idea.

00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:32.090
She whispers it to mama.

00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:34.860
Daddy laughs when he hears.

00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:40.030
"All right," he says,
"if you tiptoe."

00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:49.890
Here's Sophie at her
quietest, her tiptoeingest.

00:15:49.890 --> 00:15:57.400
The curtains at grandpa's
window, well, keep your eye on it.

00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:07.130
And eventually where's Sophie?

00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:10.540
Grandpa wakes, oh, yawns.

00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:20.160
Ah. Behind the curtain a commotion
-- wiggly, jiggly, and giggly.

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:24.510
Sophie's grandpa says, "That's you.

00:16:24.510 --> 00:16:27.710
Well, I'll be."

00:16:30.130 --> 00:16:34.770
"Here I am, grandpa," Sophie says.

00:16:34.770 --> 00:16:44.370
"Here I am like always."

00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:51.590
Now, here's the thing.

00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:57.610
The book is really very much
like, again, that what I look for.

00:16:57.610 --> 00:17:00.920
Well, I have a great-granddaughter
and she's

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:03.140
with us mostly on the weekends.

00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:04.720
We have her two cats.

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:09.520
And by the way, you'll see how the
role of the cat in all of this.

00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:13.630
But Sophie -- my granddaughter
Zion who, again,

00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:15.670
loves to play hide-and-seek.

00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:19.380
And as a matter of fact, she brings
me back to a kind of youthfulness

00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:23.530
that I've almost lost until
my great-granddaughter.

00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:27.770
One of the things I wanted to
do with [inaudible] was to talk

00:17:27.770 --> 00:17:30.610
about that relationship,
but I also wanted

00:17:30.610 --> 00:17:34.360 position:56%
to talk a lot about the grandfather.

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:37.960
And I wanted to talk about
his sort of back stories.

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:43.970
So when deciding where to hide
the objects, I chose places

00:17:43.970 --> 00:17:49.820
where it would sort of demonstrate
and speak to this world that --

00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:54.090
and a well-lived life
of the grandfather.

00:17:54.090 --> 00:18:02.930
So the paperclip is in the
band of a soldier's cap.

00:18:02.930 --> 00:18:05.920
So it suggests -- it
just suggests that he was

00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:08.080
in the Army at one point.

00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:14.150
And then of course, the rubber
band was wrapped around a football.

00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:20.080
And the role of the artist
is to actually build a world,

00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:23.630
to build sort of a visual
world for the readers.

00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:24.930
And you'll notice next

00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:29.940
to the football might be a
trophy, a football trophy.

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:32.540
So I'm letting you in on something

00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:35.420
or I'm actually letting
you read the pictures.

00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:39.240
So not only is it a search
and find, but it also deals

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:41.880
with the life of this grandfather.

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:43.850
So it goes on, of course.

00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:50.230 position:56%
Then you have the -- trying to think
of the order of the paintbrush,

00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:57.090
which was that we get a sense that
the grandmother was a painter.

00:18:57.090 --> 00:18:59.000
And that's, of course,
of value to him.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.300
So it goes on.

00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:01.600
Of course, the lemon drop.

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:03.280
Who could resist a
lemon drop, right?

00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:06.980
Exactly. So that's
in a box of marbles.

00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:10.200 position:56%
Now, how did I decide about marbles?

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:13.690
Because when I was a kid
I loved playing marbles.

00:19:13.690 --> 00:19:16.530
And so that you can see not only

00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:23.470
in my illustrations working towards
speaking to the story itself,

00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:26.300
the text itself, but
we're also giving --

00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:29.190
I'm giving you a part of my life.

00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:32.230
Now, if you guys venture
into buying the book,

00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:35.360
I want you to look under the cover.

00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:42.490
You guys, underneath the
cover -- you can't see it now.

00:19:42.490 --> 00:19:44.900
So that means you really
have to buy the book.

00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:50.240
But the case cover, it's not
only the objects that you find

00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:54.350
in the book that the grandpa hides,

00:19:54.350 --> 00:20:00.200
but also on the case cover are the
tools that I used to make the book.

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:05.860
So you'll find in this illustration
pencils that I used, pastels,

00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:08.690
of course, water colors,
and pencils.

00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:13.040
Now, pencils is the
really the instrument

00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:15.310
or the drawing tool of choice.

00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:19.250
And a little story about that
because I had an interview earlier.

00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:22.330
And we were talking about
the love of drawing.

00:20:22.330 --> 00:20:25.490
And I said, "You know what's
so cool about all this?"

00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:27.120
I was just thinking about this.

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:31.060
I said, "If you read about me,
and I write a lot of pieces,

00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:38.470 position:56%
essays on my process, and the medium
is pencil and water color on paper."

00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:44.500
Okay. So I write a lot about the
fact that, again, that tool --

00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:49.360
instrument of choice -- to help
me make marks is the pencil.

00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:53.850
Now, here's the thing
that I just thought about.

00:20:53.850 --> 00:20:58.230 position:56%
When I was a kid growing up, I
didn't have access to art materials.

00:20:58.230 --> 00:21:05.670
My parents weren't museum
or gallery visitors at all.

00:21:05.670 --> 00:21:12.540 position:56%
They didn't have a cool
understanding of what an artist was.

00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:16.900
What's interesting is although they
supported their young son's need

00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:21.250
to draw, so I always
had materials at hand.

00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:23.910
Here's the cool part.

00:21:23.910 --> 00:21:27.240
I grew up on a very small street

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:29.880
in the Germantown section
of Philadelphia.

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:33.450
All of the neighbors
were African-Americans

00:21:33.450 --> 00:21:35.350
who migrated south.

00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:38.930
Outside of that world were
Jewish and Italian communities.

00:21:38.930 --> 00:21:43.190
So in the '40s we were
somewhat isolated.

00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:48.190
In order to keep the young boys
somewhat busy in a positive way,

00:21:48.190 --> 00:21:50.650
we were encouraged to draw.

00:21:50.650 --> 00:21:55.770
And my parents didn't have a sense
about what art might lead to,

00:21:55.770 --> 00:21:58.460
but the boys were actually
encouraged to draw

00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:00.840
as a positive way to use that time.

00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:07.330
I'm going to go back to the fact
that the pencil as instrument

00:22:07.330 --> 00:22:10.960
of choice on that block
of row homes,

00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:14.480
and the end of that block
there was a factory.

00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:18.030
The factory was a pencil factory.

00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:22.230
And my grandfather
worked in the factory.

00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:26.200
And he would bring
home lots of pencils.

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:30.830
So here's the thing about being an
artist for you parents out there

00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:35.260
and grandparents that might have
children that are interested

00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:41.610
in drawing -- that
key piece that started

00:22:41.610 --> 00:22:45.710
when I was a very young child,
the fashion and the love

00:22:45.710 --> 00:22:49.440
for making a mark and then
making a mark with the pencil.

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:54.140
And that has stayed with me over
the course of some almost --

00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:58.830 position:56%
my first book was published in 1964.

00:22:58.830 --> 00:23:02.800
It was done in pencil
with color washes.

00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:06.170
And today when I get up in the
morning and most days when I get

00:23:06.170 --> 00:23:09.080
up in the morning and
I walk to the studio,

00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:15.140
I sit down at my drawing board,
and most often I pick up a pencil.

00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:18.090

I ever get frustrated

00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:49.040
when my drawing doesn't turn
the out way I want it to be?

00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:51.800
As a young artist you did
because you're always searching

00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:55.510
for an idea actually to build on.

00:23:55.510 --> 00:24:01.200 position:56%
I will tell you this, though, the
frustration as an adult artist tends

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:04.390
to lead to a better result.

00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:09.420
Why? Because frustration means
that what you see that comes

00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:12.110
to mind first is not working.

00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:17.660
Most oftentimes in order
to do a more original idea,

00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:19.830
you have to dig a little deeper.

00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:24.200
And the gateway to sometimes
digging deeper is frustration,

00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:28.200
that something isn't work and
then how do I make it work?

To tell you the truth, I
think I started as soon

00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:06.120
as my parents gave me something
to mark with and mark on.

00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:14.620
I was on a bunk bed.

00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:16.170
I had the top bunk.

00:25:16.170 --> 00:25:17.470
And guess what?

00:25:17.470 --> 00:25:20.320
I would sometimes draw on the wall.

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:25.040
But however -- this is it --
my father never scolded me.

00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:26.540
You know what he did?

00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:28.700 position:56%
Every once in a while he would paint

00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:32.830
over the drawing and
I would start again.

00:25:32.830 --> 00:25:34.510
Thank you, thank you very much.

00:25:34.510 --> 00:25:37.180
Thank you for your
smiles and your support.

00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:39.350
[ Applause ]

00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:43.050
