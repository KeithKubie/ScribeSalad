00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:02.685
You are thinking
about buying a house,

00:00:02.685 --> 00:00:04.059
but you really
want to figure out

00:00:04.059 --> 00:00:06.740
how much area does
the house cover.

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.350
What is the square
footage of the house?

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:12.530
Or what is the area of the
foundation of the house?

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:14.910
So right here, we have the
floor plan of the house.

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.761
And you're tasked
with finding its area.

00:00:16.761 --> 00:00:18.510
And you're given the
dimensions of a bunch

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:19.530
of walls of the house.

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:21.290
This wall right here is 18 feet.

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:22.620
This is 8 feet.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:27.640
This is 20 feet, 20 feet,
5 feet, 26 feet, 15 feet,

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:28.812
and 25 feet.

00:00:28.812 --> 00:00:30.020
But you're a little confused.

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:31.880
You know how to find
the area of rectangles,

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.170
but how do you find an area
of a strange shape like this?

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.030
So I encourage you
to pause this video

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.850
and try to figure out the area
of this strange house footprint

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.700
shape, floor plan shape,
using the techniques

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.450
that you already know about.

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:49.170
So what you already
do know about

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.750
is how to find the
area of rectangles.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.390
So if we can break
this house's floor plan

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.410
into a series of
rectangles and find out

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.410
the areas of those
rectangles, then we

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.830
can figure out the area
of this entire house.

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.740
So let's break it into a
bunch of simpler rectangles.

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.269
So I could have
one rectangle here.

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:10.190
It has a width of 20 feet, and
it has a length of 20 feet.

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.290
So that would be a
rectangle right over there.

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.590
We should be able to
figure out its area.

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.200
Then I could set up
another rectangle

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.930
that has a width of 26
feet and has a length.

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:25.461
That's its length
right over there.

00:01:25.461 --> 00:01:26.960
And we could think
about in a second

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.475
what that length actually is.

00:01:28.475 --> 00:01:29.850
Actually, let's
think about that.

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.590
How would we figure out what
this length actually is?

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.310
Well, this length
plus 5 feet is going

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.570
to be the same thing as
this length over here.

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.690
It's the same as the opposite
wall of this rectangle.

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:45.940
So this length plus
5 feet is 20 feet.

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.550
Well, this must be 15 feet.

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:52.827
So this blue rectangle is 15
feet long and 26 feet wide.

00:01:52.827 --> 00:01:54.160
Now let's add another rectangle.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.630
We could have one
that's 18 feet long

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.880
and then goes the entire
length of the house.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.190
Goes the entire length
of the house like that.

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.060
And you might say, wait, how
do we figure out its width?

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.699
How do we figure out the
width of this rectangle?

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:12.160
Well, we know that
this is 8 feet.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.010
We know that this
is 20 feet, and we

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.460
know that this is 26 feet.

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.670
So the entire width is going
to be 26 feet plus 20 feet.

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.360
So 26 plus 20 gets us to 46.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.730
Plus 8 gets us to 54 feet.

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:34.150
So this is 54 feet
right over here.

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:35.030
Did I do that right?

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.530
Let's see.

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.040
8 plus 36 would be 34,
plus 20 is 54 feet.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.929
And then finally we have one
last rectangle to deal with,

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:43.470
this rectangle right
over here, which

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:50.210
is 15 feet long
and 25 feet wide.

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:52.360
And so now we can
calculate the areas

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.480
of the different rectangles.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.930
So the total area is going to
be the 20 feet by the 20 feet.

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.340
So let's just multiply them.

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.580
So it's going to be 20 times 20.

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.040
That's this area
right over here.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.956
Plus 15 times 26.

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.420
That's this area
right over there.

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:30.180
Plus 18 times 54, which is
this area right over there.

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:38.240
And then finally,
plus 15 times 25,

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:43.880
which is this area
right over here.

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.220
So we just have to now
evaluate these things.

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.440
So what is 20 times 20?

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.040
Well, this is going to be 400.

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.350
What's 15 times 26?

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:53.640
Well, let's multiply it out.

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.720
26 times 15.

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.146
6 times 5 is 30.

00:03:59.146 --> 00:04:03.320
2 times 5 is 10, plus 3 is 13.

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:07.770
Now I'm going to multiply a
10 times 26, gets us to 260.

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:09.380
And you add these two together.

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.110
You get 390.

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.620
So it's 400 plus 390.

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.552
Now we've got to multiply
18 times 54, or 54 times 18.

00:04:18.552 --> 00:04:19.260
So let's do that.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.660
54 times 18.

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.430
8 times 4 is 32.

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.970
8 times 5 is 40, plus 3 is 43.

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.720
Now we're multiplying
this 10 times 54.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.720
Gets us to 540.

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:34.500
And we add.

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.100
2 plus 0 is 2.

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.970
This 30 plus the
40 gets us to a 70.

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.320
In other words, a 3 plus
a 4 in the tens place.

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.930
And then 400 plus 500 is 900.

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.730
So we get to 972.

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:51.300
And one more of these
multiplications.

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:52.939
25 times 15.

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:54.730
And actually, we could
do that in our head.

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:58.300
This is 26 times
15, so 25 times 15

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.860
is going to be this minus 15.

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.090
So it's going to be 300.

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.250
Let's see, if you subtract
10, you get to 380.

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:07.870
Subtract another 5, 375.

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.070
Let me do it in that same color.

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:16.120
So plus 375.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:17.700
And now let's add
up these numbers.

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:33.770
So we have 375 plus
972, plus 390, plus 400.

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:37.920
And so this gets us to 5--
this is the home stretch.

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:39.620
We deserve a drum roll now.

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:42.341
5 plus 2 is 7.

00:05:42.341 --> 00:05:47.390
7 plus 7 is 14, plus 9 is 23.

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:53.710
2 plus 3 is 5, plus
9 is 14, 17, 21.

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:55.620
So the square footage
of this house?

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:57.335
2,137 square feet.
