00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:02.920
So you've learned a lot
about retention and

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:06.912
how it's pretty normal to have around
40% player attention after just one day.

00:00:06.912 --> 00:00:09.080
Ankur, why do you think so

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.100
many players leave after just
the first day of playing a game?

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.170
&gt;&gt; Well, it's very hard to make
a game that's engaging for everybody.

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.490
So people might leave after trying it
out and finding it's not a great fit.

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.670
For example, kids tend to have a lot
more time on their hands than adults.

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:27.880
So they prefer longer games
with more fun story lines.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:28.836
&gt;&gt; That make sense.

00:00:28.836 --> 00:00:31.100
Everyone plays games
a little differently.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.376
So what can game developers do
to keep players interested?

00:00:34.376 --> 00:00:37.660
&gt;&gt; Most successful games
have a target audience.

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.080
They know they can't appeal to everyone.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.460
And so they focus on the specific
age group or a type of gamer and

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.170
try to design a game that is
targeted to that audience.

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:49.520
&gt;&gt; I think I have a great idea for

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.550
a game that appeals to
people around my age.

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.235
Check it out.
[SOUND].

00:00:56.235 --> 00:00:57.660
What do you think?

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.640
&gt;&gt; It seems fairly simple.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.940
Maybe you can make it harder by
adding some goals or obstacles.

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.260
&gt;&gt; Good idea, how about I bounce
the ball through a ring of fire and

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:07.330
into the goal?

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:08.700
&gt;&gt; That's more like it.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.330
When you're thinking about your game and
deciding what it looks like and

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.510
how difficult it is to play,
you should always put yourself

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:20.070
in the players' shoes and think about
what will be most exciting for them.

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.400
&gt;&gt; Ask yourself are they younger?

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.280
Hardcore gamers or more casual?

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.670
&gt;&gt; Exactly, it's important to make your
game pace fit your player's skill level.

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.490
Like adding a ring of fire and

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.760
goals makes bouncing ball a lot
more challenging and fun.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.710
&gt;&gt; Let's look at some examples
of game apps that do this well.
