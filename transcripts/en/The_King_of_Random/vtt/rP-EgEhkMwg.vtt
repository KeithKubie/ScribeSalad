00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.533
In today's video,
we're taking a look

00:00:01.533 --> 00:00:03.168
at the difference
between full batteries

00:00:03.168 --> 00:00:05.619
and batteries that have been
drained of all of their juices.

00:00:05.619 --> 00:00:06.600
How are they different?

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.460
And how can you easily
tell them apart?

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.040
[Music]

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.480
We've got a bunch of batteries.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.600
So far, these batteries are
in good condition,

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.600
but we want to do
some tests to see

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.600
what's different between
a fully charged battery,

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.240
and it fully drained battery.

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:24.751
And we want to see
if we can figure out

00:00:24.751 --> 00:00:27.101
how you can tell the difference
between the two.

00:00:27.101 --> 00:00:28.278
Here's the basic idea.

00:00:28.278 --> 00:00:28.883
We have seen

00:00:28.883 --> 00:00:30.700
that you can bounce
batteries to tell

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.060
whether or not they are charged.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.100
So we're going to try that,
see what's different,

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.900
and then try a few
other tests as well.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.500
First step is we need
to drain power out of these.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.000
So I've got a flashlight.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.600
When I bought it
on the packaging,

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.700
it said that it gave like
two and a half hours of light.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.300
So I figured we can put
the battery in there,

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.446
see how dim the flashlight gets,

00:00:49.446 --> 00:00:52.960
and then take it out,
and see how much worse it is.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.440
After that, we're going
to put batteries

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.900
in for progressively smaller
increments of time to see

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.351
if we can get a perfect scale
of a fully charged battery

00:00:59.351 --> 00:01:01.892
to a fully dead battery, and see
what the differences are.

00:01:01.892 --> 00:01:04.149
So we've got batteries
in this flashlight, and now,

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:06.700
what we want to do is just let
it sit for a long time.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.520
We want to drain all of the
power out of these batteries.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.800
All right, we have
now taken batteries,

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.670
and we have drained them a lot.

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.900
We actually had one set
of batteries we left in

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.000
overnight to really try
and drain them off,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
and that wasn't even
necessarily quite enough.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.446
So we then took those batteries,

00:01:21.446 --> 00:01:23.780
and we put them
into a remote control car,

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.800
and left it running to try
and drain them even more.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:27.622
Other than that,

00:01:27.622 --> 00:01:29.800
we have batteries
at 15 minute increments

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.350
from 2 hours and 15 minutes
all the way down to none.

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.400
So first thing,
I want to try that bounce test.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.545
Everybody says that you
can bounce the batteries,

00:01:37.545 --> 00:01:39.800
and a perfectly charged battery
isn't going to bounce,

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.100
and the one that's pretty close

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.900
to empty is going to have
a lot more bounce to it.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.100
First thing I want to do is just
holding it over the counter,

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.659
and dropping it,
the same way anyone would

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:48.538
if they're pulling batteries
out of a junk drawer,

00:01:48.538 --> 00:01:50.605
and they're not sure, like,
oh, is this good battery?

00:01:50.605 --> 00:01:51.400
Is it a bad battery?

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.282
This is supposed to be
the super easy way to test.

00:01:54.282 --> 00:01:55.510
If this works at all,

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:58.392
I want to scale it up,
and have just a whole setup

00:01:58.392 --> 00:02:00.935
that will drop all
of the batteries at once,

00:02:00.935 --> 00:02:03.288
from fully charged
to completely drained,

00:02:03.288 --> 00:02:05.500
and see if we can get
them to just bounce

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.650
in a nice little array.

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:07.860
But first, let's try

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.520
the "I just found the battery
in a junk drawer" test.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.820
[Music]

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.520
So the one at 2 hours
and 15 minutes,

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:16.700
quite a bit of bounce to it.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.440
But the one
that's fully charged.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.720
It's like the one ring.

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:21.720
There's no bounce.

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.400
Editors, can we put in the clip

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.500
of the One Ring hitting
the ground, please?

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.300
So, I want to know
if there's a weight difference.

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.056
They don't feel
any different to me.

00:02:32.056 --> 00:02:34.106
But that doesn't mean
that it's not there.

00:02:34.106 --> 00:02:35.902
As far as I can tell
just holding them,

00:02:35.902 --> 00:02:36.800
they feel the same.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.900
I'm just trying to see
like is there any slight bowing,

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.200
or change in like
how flat any parts of it are.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.900
I really am
not seeing anything,

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.310
so I don't think that's changed.

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:47.500
I think that's intentional.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.700
They don't want
the battery to distort

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:50.700
as you use it.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.300
We have a very sensitive scale.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.600
This thing is designed
for measuring gunpowder,

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.700
and we've got it set
to grams right now.

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:58.700
So let's do a test.

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.574
All right, let's get one
of our fully charged batteries.

00:03:01.574 --> 00:03:02.150
Here we go.

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:03.234
It's fully charged?

00:03:03.234 --> 00:03:03.990
Fully charged.

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.840
&gt;&gt; No marks on it.
&gt;&gt; Alright.

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.300
24.4.

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.480
[Music]

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.700
24.45.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.500
[Music]

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.100
24.25.

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.720
So we do have a little bit
of variation here.

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.788
Amost all of these batteries
are from one package.

00:03:21.788 --> 00:03:24.023
They all came together,
and you can see

00:03:24.023 --> 00:03:26.500
that they actually say
USA printed on top.

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.795
Yeah.

00:03:26.795 --> 00:03:29.400
These two batteries came
with the flashlight,

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.800
and they do not have USA printed
to the top of them.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.400
So they are slightly
different in some way.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.500
So this is the one

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.200
that we just tried
the bounce test with.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.880
This is at 2 hours
15 minutes of use.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.120
24.25.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.000
Now, that would be exactly
the same as the full battery

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.149
from this same batch.

00:03:45.149 --> 00:03:45.903
That's true.

00:03:45.903 --> 00:03:47.600
Also 2 hours
and 15 minutes,

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:48.838
just the other one.

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:50.780
24.35.

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.700
Still very much
within the same range.

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.820
Yeah, grab a one in the middle,
and see which--

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:55.900
30 minutes.

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.440
[Music]

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:59.200
24.4.

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.400
So I'm going to say the weight,

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.300
and I didn't think the weight
it was going to change.

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:03.314
Nothing is escaping.

00:04:03.314 --> 00:04:05.800
Nothing is leaving the battery
as you're using it.

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.800
And so, the mass is the same,

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.500
it's not going
to be any different.

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.400
Even though I was pretty sure
that was the case,

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.782
I did want to test.

00:04:12.782 --> 00:04:15.382
Because maybe
something was escaping.

00:04:15.382 --> 00:04:18.200
But it seems
that the mass is unchanged.

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.815
We've now had
these three batteries

00:04:19.815 --> 00:04:22.000
running our remote-control car
for a little bit

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.500
after they ran the flashlight
for a long time.

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.874
So these two batteries were
in the flashlight overnight,

00:04:26.874 --> 00:04:29.206
and then to really try
and drain them the rest the way,

00:04:29.206 --> 00:04:31.040
we threw them into
this remote control car.

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.020
We drove that around.

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.000
0% batteries versus full battery.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.400
We've already done bounce tests,

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.156
and we've seen that our full
battery will not bounce,

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.800
whereas our empty battery will.

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.660
[Music]

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:45.180
Not bad.

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.500
So empty, also empty, full.

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:49.510
Let's take our voltmeter.

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:51.700
and test it
on the batteries to see

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:54.030
how much power each
of these have.

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.020
First off, a full battery.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:01.300
Okay, we are getting a reading
of 1.6 volts, almost exactly.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:02.970
Just a hair over.

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:04.600
1.6 volts.

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.120
Now, our drain batteries.

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.700
This is as dead
as we can get it.

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:11.900
[Music]

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.460
We are looking at 0.0981.

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:16.777
So that's not zero.

00:05:16.777 --> 00:05:17.500
It's not showing

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.600
that there's no power
left in this battery.

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.500
But in the RC car,
this wasn't working anymore.

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:26.500
So a dead battery actually
still has over half

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:28.505
of what a battery has initially.

00:05:28.505 --> 00:05:30.314
In terms of voltage, at least.

00:05:30.314 --> 00:05:30.612
Yeah.

00:05:30.612 --> 00:05:31.385
Now, how well

00:05:31.385 --> 00:05:34.100
that translates into usable
power probably depends

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:35.500
on what device you're using.

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.335
If I put these two dead
batteries in our flashlights,

00:05:38.335 --> 00:05:41.100
we're still getting light
out of the flashlight.

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.458
So it's not a hundred
percent drained clearly,

00:05:43.458 --> 00:05:44.400
but in something

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.456
like the RC car, it needs
a little bit more power.

00:05:46.456 --> 00:05:48.577
Especially if the wheels
are actually in contact

00:05:48.577 --> 00:05:49.300
with the ground,

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:52.100
it can barely overcome the
coefficient of static friction

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:53.100
to get this thing moving.

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:54.000
For the most part,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.400
it just like limps along
at a quarter of a mile an hour.

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.050
Whereas with full batteries,

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:01.200
it actually kind of zooms
around a little bit.

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:04.480
Full battery, 1.6-ish volts.

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:09.300
Empty battery, 0.98 volts.

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:10.338
There's one that was

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:12.258
in the flashlight
for only 15 minutes.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.620
1.476.

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:17.280
That's a quick drop off.

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:19.060
Yeah, I would not have
expected that much--

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:20.000
Even in 15 minutes,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.400
it goes from 1.6 to 1.47.

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:23.500
Like that just...

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:25.600
We tried weighing the batteries,

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:27.074
and now, we've
used a voltmeter.

00:06:27.074 --> 00:06:28.252
And we can definitely tell

00:06:28.252 --> 00:06:30.552
with the voltmeter
what's a good fresh battery,

00:06:30.552 --> 00:06:31.583
and what's been used.

00:06:31.583 --> 00:06:33.100
And it drops off pretty quick.

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:34.500
I was surprised at how fast.

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.800
So, after 15 minutes,
you can already see

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.900
that you've got
a 0.2 drop in it.

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:40.800
That's kind of insane
given the fact that

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.600
at the end of running
something in a car

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:45.620
until it would no longer
go anywhere, it was 0.98.

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:48.120
It's clearly not a linear scale
for using the voltage

00:06:48.122 --> 00:06:48.800
in a battery.

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.400
It drops off very
quickly at first,

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.603
and then levels out quite a bit.

00:06:52.603 --> 00:06:54.600
We had to run these batteries

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:57.600
for a long time to get
them below 1 volt.

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:00.100
We've got some Masonite,
we got a board,

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:01.500
and we've got some strips.

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:04.200
We are just going to glue
all these strips on,

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:06.000
at least one battery wide,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.316
and then have just
sort of a rail system.

00:07:08.316 --> 00:07:09.926
And all of these batteries

00:07:09.926 --> 00:07:12.225
will just fall down
next to each other,

00:07:12.225 --> 00:07:14.049
and we get a good shot, a test,

00:07:14.049 --> 00:07:16.200
the batteries in line
from a completely

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.900
charged battery to completely
discharged battery.

00:07:25.280 --> 00:08:05.520
[Music]

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:06.880
Here's our battery track.

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:09.640
In theory, we should be able
to take a battery,

00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:12.080
and drop it.

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:14.140
It worked. It dropped.

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:18.800
Fell all the way down
with pretty much no resistance,

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:20.200
that's the goal right there.

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:31.200
[Music]

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:33.500
We've got our battery
rail box set up,

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:34.800
and hopefully,

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:36.815
the automatic drop system
all works smoothly.

00:08:36.815 --> 00:08:38.110
Let's give this a test.

00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:40.900
Our batteries are currently
in line from fully charged

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:42.400
to very much depleted.

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:43.700
3, 2, 1.

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:50.580
[Music]

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:51.300
That was cool.

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:52.005
It was cool.

00:08:52.005 --> 00:08:54.500
They didn't all hit
the ground at the same time.

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:55.300
It didn't.

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:58.061
That's really cool.

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:00.856
Yeah, that looks...

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:02.000
That looks good.

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:06.260
Like once we can actually get
it to go on the right speed.

00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:07.430
I think it's going to work.

00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:08.240
I think so.

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:16.940
[Music]

00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:18.600
We are having just a little bit
of trouble getting all

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:20.211
the batteries to drop
at the same time.

00:09:20.211 --> 00:09:22.326
I think they're sticking
a little bit to the paint.

00:09:22.326 --> 00:09:25.409
And so we actually just added
some corn starch on the inside,

00:09:25.409 --> 00:09:27.059
to sort of a dry
lubricant, and...

00:09:27.059 --> 00:09:28.600
It's going to be
a little powdery,

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:30.442
but I think it's going
to work a little bit better.

00:09:30.442 --> 00:09:31.400
Yeah, this should be good.

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:32.050
All right.

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:34.100
3, 2, 1.

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:42.580
[Music]

00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:44.140
From a higher spot this time.

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:45.680
Oh, no.

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:48.560
3, 2, 1.

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:52.440
[Music]

00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:53.576
Look, it kike hits it.

00:09:53.576 --> 00:09:54.164
That's it.

00:09:54.164 --> 00:09:57.000
No-- Oh, one of them fully
jumped up out of the frame.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.960
[Music]

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:01.600
Guys, it's not all.

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:02.971
We've always got more
for you to see.

00:10:02.971 --> 00:10:05.366
That box up at the top is going
to take you to our last video.

00:10:05.366 --> 00:10:06.500
You should go check that out.

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:07.734
The other box
is going to show you

00:10:07.734 --> 00:10:09.502
what YouTube thinks you
should be watching next.

00:10:09.502 --> 00:10:11.009
And if you hit this bomb
here in the middle,

00:10:11.009 --> 00:10:12.200
you'll be subscribe
to the channel,

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:13.900
and that way, you're never going
to miss a cool video.

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:15.121
Don't forget to ring that bell,

00:10:15.121 --> 00:10:16.500
and we will see you
in the next one.

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:17.640
Talk to you then.
