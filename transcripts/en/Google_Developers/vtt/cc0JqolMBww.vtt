Ying: Uh, this is
Implementing Money Making SDKs.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.567
Thanks for coming today.

00:00:07.567 --> 00:00:09.734
How many of you guys
went to the, uh,

00:00:09.734 --> 00:00:13.234
Build a Mobile Business,
Not Just a Mobile App yesterday?

00:00:13.234 --> 00:00:16.100
Okay, so about half
of you guys.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.100
So, um, this is, uh, Dean Browne
and Paul Hounshell.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.767
I'm Mike Ying.

00:00:21.767 --> 00:00:23.767
Uh, we are three
of the engineers

00:00:23.767 --> 00:00:25.767
on the mobile display
ads team,

00:00:25.767 --> 00:00:28.267
and we're gonna talk you through
a little bit about, uh,

00:00:28.267 --> 00:00:30.367
implementing ads
in your application,

00:00:30.367 --> 00:00:32.634
and then also some
of the best practices

00:00:32.634 --> 00:00:35.934
and ways of making sure that
people are gonna see your ads,

00:00:35.934 --> 00:00:39.367
uh, click on your ads,
and, make you some money.

00:00:39.367 --> 00:00:42.367
So first, there's the QR code.

00:00:42.367 --> 00:00:44.367
If you have any feedback for us,

00:00:44.367 --> 00:00:46.367
uh, scan that,
tell us what you think.

00:00:46.367 --> 00:00:48.367
Also, if you're tweeting today,

00:00:48.367 --> 00:00:50.367
use hash tag io2011

00:00:50.367 --> 00:00:53.367
and hash tag GoogleAPIs.

00:00:53.367 --> 00:00:55.367
All right, so, um,

00:00:55.367 --> 00:00:57.300
today, what we're gonna do

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.367
is we'll just kind of go
through a quick overview.

00:01:00.367 --> 00:01:03.501
We're gonna run through
the code parts of this talk,

00:01:03.501 --> 00:01:05.167
um, relatively quickly.

00:01:05.167 --> 00:01:08.067
Everything we're gonna show you
today is also gonna be available

00:01:08.067 --> 00:01:11.734
at our web site.
It's code.google.com/mobile/ads.

00:01:11.734 --> 00:01:13.701
We'll have that up at the end
of the talk, as well,

00:01:13.701 --> 00:01:15.334
so you can see it.

00:01:15.334 --> 00:01:17.834
Um, so we'll talk about--
a little bit about the setup,

00:01:17.834 --> 00:01:19.834
the integration
on three platforms--

00:01:19.834 --> 00:01:22.267
Android, IOS, Windows Phone 7.

00:01:22.267 --> 00:01:24.200
We'll talk you through
a little bit about

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.067
the tracking and the reporting
after that,

00:01:26.067 --> 00:01:28.267
and then some
of the best practices and FAQs,

00:01:28.267 --> 00:01:31.267
and we'll try to keep some time
at the end for Q&amp;A.

00:01:31.267 --> 00:01:33.267
Okay, so, um,

00:01:33.267 --> 00:01:35.267
for those of you that didn't go

00:01:35.267 --> 00:01:38.767
to the session yesterday,
what's a money making SDK?

00:01:38.767 --> 00:01:42.367
Um, the AdMob network is a way
for basically

00:01:42.367 --> 00:01:44.367
you to show ads

00:01:44.367 --> 00:01:46.567
from our advertisers,

00:01:46.567 --> 00:01:48.567
and every time someone clicks

00:01:48.567 --> 00:01:50.567
on an ad, uh, you get paid.

00:01:50.567 --> 00:01:53.567
And we take a share of that,
you get a share of that,

00:01:53.567 --> 00:01:55.567
and, uh, you get paid.

00:01:55.567 --> 00:01:59.567
So first step,

00:01:59.567 --> 00:02:02.300
go to www.admob.com.

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.634
Uh, you can register today

00:02:04.634 --> 00:02:06.634
with your Google account.

00:02:06.634 --> 00:02:08.634
This is, uh, the same
Google account you use

00:02:08.634 --> 00:02:11.634
for whatever other services
you're using with Google.

00:02:11.634 --> 00:02:13.634
Um, if you're
an Android publisher,

00:02:13.634 --> 00:02:15.634
use the same Google account
that you use

00:02:15.634 --> 00:02:17.467
on the market publisher's site.

00:02:17.467 --> 00:02:20.467
Um, you'll add a site--
that comes from the old days,

00:02:20.467 --> 00:02:22.467
if you guys remember WAP,

00:02:22.467 --> 00:02:24.467
when there were still
mobile web sites.

00:02:24.467 --> 00:02:26.601
Um, so you can
basically use a site

00:02:26.601 --> 00:02:30.000
anytime you want to show an ad
in any of your applications.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.734
We recommend using
multiple placements

00:02:32.734 --> 00:02:35.033
and multiple site I.D.'s
for each of those.

00:02:35.033 --> 00:02:37.934
We'll talk a little bit about
that a little bit later today.

00:02:37.934 --> 00:02:40.934
And then you pick your platform
and you download your SDK.

00:02:40.934 --> 00:02:43.400
So if it's Android,
you'll get a jar,

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.200
if it's IOS,
you'll get a static library,

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.067
and so on and so forth.

00:02:48.067 --> 00:02:50.901
So first, we'll talk you through

00:02:50.901 --> 00:02:53.868
the Android platform.

00:02:53.868 --> 00:02:56.067
So for our demo,
what we use--

00:02:56.067 --> 00:02:58.400
we use Eclipse,
we use the Android SDK,

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.834
and we use the ADT plugin
for Eclipse.

00:03:00.834 --> 00:03:02.934
Um, none of this
requires Eclipse.

00:03:02.934 --> 00:03:04.634
You're welcome to do

00:03:04.634 --> 00:03:07.100
whatever development
environment you like.

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.000
Um, we simply give this library
to you as a jar,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.367
and you integrate it
into your project.

00:03:13.367 --> 00:03:15.367
Uh, so what I'll
walk you through is,

00:03:15.367 --> 00:03:17.667
first, you have to add
the ad's SDK

00:03:17.667 --> 00:03:20.567
to your project and build path.
I'll kind of gloss over that.

00:03:20.567 --> 00:03:22.567
That's already done for you
in the demo.

00:03:22.567 --> 00:03:25.334
And then add the AdView
to your layout XML,

00:03:25.334 --> 00:03:28.334
and ad the AdActivity
to your manifest.

00:03:28.334 --> 00:03:31.334
So if you just want to do
a very simple,

00:03:31.334 --> 00:03:33.968
uh, ad integration,

00:03:33.968 --> 00:03:35.968
and you don't really
care about, uh,

00:03:35.968 --> 00:03:38.567
any sort of targeting
or anything like that,

00:03:38.567 --> 00:03:40.734
you just want to show an ad
and make some money,

00:03:40.734 --> 00:03:43.267
this would be one
of the easiest ways of doing it.

00:03:43.267 --> 00:03:45.267
Uh, you take the AdView--

00:03:45.267 --> 00:03:47.534
it's a class
that we give to you--

00:03:47.534 --> 00:03:49.801
you'll request
a particular size.

00:03:49.801 --> 00:03:51.801
In this case,
this is a banner.

00:03:51.801 --> 00:03:54.567
That's 320 pixels by 50 pixels.

00:03:54.567 --> 00:03:56.467
Um, in the case of Android,

00:03:56.467 --> 00:03:58.501
we tell you to use
device independent pixels.

00:03:58.501 --> 00:04:01.434
This way, you get an ad
that looks good on any device,

00:04:01.434 --> 00:04:03.434
whether it's a, you know,

00:04:03.434 --> 00:04:05.434
a Nexus S
that's in high density,

00:04:05.434 --> 00:04:07.834
or one of the old, say,
G1s that's in the regular,

00:04:07.834 --> 00:04:10.634
uh, you know, single,
uh, 1.0 density.

00:04:10.634 --> 00:04:14.033
Um, in this case,
the main layout

00:04:14.033 --> 00:04:16.701
has been named,
uh, "Main Layout."

00:04:16.701 --> 00:04:18.434
It's a linear layout,

00:04:18.434 --> 00:04:20.534
so we find that view
by its I.D.,

00:04:20.534 --> 00:04:22.934
then we add the AdView
to the layout,

00:04:22.934 --> 00:04:25.501
and then what we do

00:04:25.501 --> 00:04:27.501
is we create an ad request.

00:04:27.501 --> 00:04:29.901
Um, an ad request is basically

00:04:29.901 --> 00:04:31.901
giving all the information

00:04:31.901 --> 00:04:33.901
that you need,
uh, to give us--

00:04:33.901 --> 00:04:36.133
so that we can target
the ad appropriately.

00:04:36.133 --> 00:04:38.767
This includes things
like keywords,

00:04:38.767 --> 00:04:41.367
uh, whether or not you want
this to be in test mode.

00:04:41.367 --> 00:04:43.367
So in this case,
for testing,

00:04:43.367 --> 00:04:45.367
uh, we set up
a particular test device.

00:04:45.367 --> 00:04:47.367
This is one of our test devices,

00:04:47.367 --> 00:04:50.234
and you set it up
as a test device

00:04:50.234 --> 00:04:53.501
to ensure that you get only ads
in test mode,

00:04:53.501 --> 00:04:57.200
meaning we won't charge anybody.
You'll just see this ad.

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.167
It's more likely
that you'll get an ad back,

00:04:59.167 --> 00:05:01.234
and then you'll
just be able to use that

00:05:01.234 --> 00:05:03.234
to see that
it's working correctly.

00:05:03.234 --> 00:05:05.234
So once you've set that up,

00:05:05.234 --> 00:05:08.234
you simply put that in
and load the ad,

00:05:08.234 --> 00:05:10.234
and it will show up.

00:05:10.234 --> 00:05:13.234
So let me switch over, and I can
kind of walk you guys through

00:05:13.234 --> 00:05:15.234
what it looks like, uh,

00:05:15.234 --> 00:05:18.267
with a few other,
um, enhancements.

00:05:25.234 --> 00:05:27.100
So, uh, to start out,

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:29.634
we'll walk you through some
of the changes that are required

00:05:29.634 --> 00:05:31.300
in the Android manifest.

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.300
This is where you
specify information

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:34.968
about your application.

00:05:34.968 --> 00:05:37.801
Uh, you can see, what we did
is we took the snake example

00:05:37.801 --> 00:05:39.801
from the Android examples.

00:05:39.801 --> 00:05:41.801
It's basically
just like the snake

00:05:41.801 --> 00:05:43.467
on the old Nokia phones,

00:05:43.467 --> 00:05:45.467
where you're a little line,
and you're running around

00:05:45.467 --> 00:05:47.467
trying to grab these dots
that are apples.

00:05:47.467 --> 00:05:50.400
Okay, first, what we did

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.868
is we added two permissions.

00:05:52.868 --> 00:05:55.000
Uh, first is
the internet permission,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.467
and second is the access
network state permission.

00:05:57.467 --> 00:05:59.467
Uh, we need those two,
obviously,

00:05:59.467 --> 00:06:01.200
to get out to the ad servers,

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:03.200
and then also to check
and see if, you know,

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:05.200
you're on WiFi or 3G.

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.200
That's part of the ways
that we'll decide

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.200
what kind of an ad
to show you.

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.200
Um, one other thing
that we ask you to do

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.200
is also to add

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:16.234
an ad activity from our jar.

00:06:16.234 --> 00:06:19.734
Um, what this does
is this allows us to, uh,

00:06:19.734 --> 00:06:22.067
show particular landing pages

00:06:22.067 --> 00:06:25.067
that don't take you outside
of the application flow.

00:06:25.067 --> 00:06:27.067
Uh, sometimes this will happen.

00:06:27.067 --> 00:06:29.067
We'll use it
when it's appropriate,

00:06:29.067 --> 00:06:31.067
and, you know, the basic idea
is that we want to make this

00:06:31.067 --> 00:06:32.834
as seamless as possible
for users,

00:06:32.834 --> 00:06:34.834
so that it doesn't feel
like they're getting,

00:06:34.834 --> 00:06:37.501
you know, pulled out
of the application.

00:06:37.501 --> 00:06:39.501
Okay, so next,

00:06:39.501 --> 00:06:42.334
um, the snake layout.

00:06:42.334 --> 00:06:44.334
Now what we've done is,

00:06:44.334 --> 00:06:46.334
we have
a basic linear layout here.

00:06:46.334 --> 00:06:49.334
Uh, there's an AdView in XML,

00:06:49.334 --> 00:06:51.334
and then a frame layout,

00:06:51.334 --> 00:06:53.834
which is where the snake game
is actually played,

00:06:53.834 --> 00:06:55.834
so, uh, you'll see right here,

00:06:55.834 --> 00:06:58.868
the AdView here
is being specified

00:06:58.868 --> 00:07:01.934
as 320 device independent
pixels wide,

00:07:01.934 --> 00:07:04.400
and 50 device
independent pixels tall.

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.467
Uh, we've also specified
an ad unit I.D.

00:07:07.467 --> 00:07:09.467
This is just
a little bit of a--

00:07:09.467 --> 00:07:11.834
it's a little bit
of a departure that we make

00:07:11.834 --> 00:07:13.901
from the terminology
used on the web site.

00:07:13.901 --> 00:07:16.400
Uh, back in the old days,
when everything was WAP,

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:19.133
uh, they were all called
site I.D.'s or publisher I.D.'s.

00:07:19.133 --> 00:07:21.567
Uh, we try to call them
ad unit I.D.'s

00:07:21.567 --> 00:07:23.234
in the case of apps.

00:07:23.234 --> 00:07:26.234
Um, a little bit later, we'll
talk about different placements

00:07:26.234 --> 00:07:28.234
and why you might want
to name different ads

00:07:28.234 --> 00:07:30.234
inside your application
with different I.D.'s.

00:07:30.234 --> 00:07:32.601
And then the last item
is the ad size,

00:07:32.601 --> 00:07:34.601
which is the banner.

00:07:34.601 --> 00:07:38.167
It's 320 by 50.

00:07:38.167 --> 00:07:40.167
And then now,

00:07:40.167 --> 00:07:43.367
let's take a look at what we do
in the snake activity.

00:07:43.367 --> 00:07:46.100
So, uh,

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:48.434
at the point at which
we had left it

00:07:48.434 --> 00:07:50.501
with the manifest
and the layout,

00:07:50.501 --> 00:07:52.000
you can probably--

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.501
would've gotten to see an ad
no matter what,

00:07:54.501 --> 00:07:57.534
but here, what we're doing
is we're making sure

00:07:57.534 --> 00:07:59.534
that this ad request

00:07:59.534 --> 00:08:02.601
is being requested,
"A," in test mode,

00:08:02.601 --> 00:08:04.634
and then I'll show you
a little bit about

00:08:04.634 --> 00:08:07.100
the ad listener call back
interface that we set up,

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:09.601
so that you can do a little bit
of different things,

00:08:09.601 --> 00:08:11.601
depending on whether
an ad comes back,

00:08:11.601 --> 00:08:14.067
when the screen, uh,
when a screen is being shown

00:08:14.067 --> 00:08:16.067
over your application,
and so on.

00:08:16.067 --> 00:08:19.067
So to walk you through,
first, we find the AdView,

00:08:19.067 --> 00:08:21.067
as named in the snake layout,

00:08:21.067 --> 00:08:23.567
we set the ad listener

00:08:23.567 --> 00:08:25.567
as, uh, this particular class,

00:08:25.567 --> 00:08:28.067
and then we create
the test request.

00:08:28.067 --> 00:08:30.667
Um, here, what we do is,
we basically just say,

00:08:30.667 --> 00:08:34.000
for the emulator, make these
ad requests in test mode.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.868
Um, it's important to do most
of your testing in test mode,

00:08:36.868 --> 00:08:38.834
only because, uh, you know,

00:08:38.834 --> 00:08:41.968
we don't want to be testing
with live traffic

00:08:41.968 --> 00:08:44.234
until we're basically
ready to, uh,

00:08:44.234 --> 00:08:46.968
submit the app
into the market, okay?

00:08:46.968 --> 00:08:50.501
So from here,
we set the test devices,

00:08:50.501 --> 00:08:52.801
and then we load the ad.

00:08:52.801 --> 00:08:55.567
Now that could really be
all you need to do.

00:08:55.567 --> 00:08:57.234
Uh, what that will do is,

00:08:57.234 --> 00:08:59.067
that makes the request,
gets the ad.

00:08:59.067 --> 00:09:01.067
We handle everything
from that point on.

00:09:01.067 --> 00:09:03.367
If the user clicks on it, um,
that's great.

00:09:03.367 --> 00:09:07.100
Uh, one thing, what we've done
here for this particular demo

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:09.767
is tried to give you
a little bit of polish

00:09:09.767 --> 00:09:11.734
around how the ad shows up.

00:09:11.734 --> 00:09:14.734
So here, we have an ad listener,

00:09:14.734 --> 00:09:17.734
uh, callback.
This is on receive ad.

00:09:17.734 --> 00:09:20.734
This is basically what happens
when an ad actually loads

00:09:20.734 --> 00:09:22.334
for the user.

00:09:22.334 --> 00:09:25.334
So in this case, I have
sort of two animations set up.

00:09:25.334 --> 00:09:28.000
I decided just to use
the scale animation here.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.868
Uh, what this means
is when the ad shows up,

00:09:30.868 --> 00:09:34.000
we're gonna take this,
and we're gonna zoom in the--

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.701
we're gonna kind of
zoom the ad in as it shows up,

00:09:37.701 --> 00:09:39.834
so over half a second.

00:09:39.834 --> 00:09:43.067
And then two other things we do

00:09:43.067 --> 00:09:46.067
are when we--
we will let you know

00:09:46.067 --> 00:09:48.067
when the user
has clicked on the ad

00:09:48.067 --> 00:09:50.067
and is about to leave
the application.

00:09:50.067 --> 00:09:52.067
Uh, this is just so that
you can know if,

00:09:52.067 --> 00:09:55.067
in the instance of snake,
maybe I want to pause this,

00:09:55.067 --> 00:09:58.067
uh, maybe I want to pop up
an options menu

00:09:58.067 --> 00:09:59.934
or something else like that,
just so that, you know,

00:09:59.934 --> 00:10:02.734
when they come back, they're
not in the middle of dying,

00:10:02.734 --> 00:10:05.734
running into the wall,
or something like that, right?

00:10:05.734 --> 00:10:07.734
All right,

00:10:07.734 --> 00:10:09.734
so now let's, uh,

00:10:09.734 --> 00:10:11.734
take a run through this,

00:10:11.734 --> 00:10:14.667
and we'll show you...

00:10:18.767 --> 00:10:21.467
So snake, it just says
"Press up to play,"

00:10:21.467 --> 00:10:23.467
so you can start playing.

00:10:23.467 --> 00:10:25.467
At the same time,

00:10:25.467 --> 00:10:28.467
the ad request is being made,

00:10:28.467 --> 00:10:30.968
and if our wireless network
works,

00:10:30.968 --> 00:10:33.767
then you will see an ad.

00:10:33.767 --> 00:10:36.501
Otherwise, you might not.

00:10:36.501 --> 00:10:38.934
Let me try it one more time.

00:10:54.934 --> 00:10:57.734
All right,
we have the demo gremlins.

00:11:01.567 --> 00:11:03.234
But you'll see.

00:11:03.234 --> 00:11:06.300
In this case, what we didn't do
is we didn't, uh, change--

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:08.100
we didn't add any code

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:10.100
for what to do

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:12.467
when the ad does not show up,

00:11:12.467 --> 00:11:14.467
So "OnFailedToReceiveAd."

00:11:14.467 --> 00:11:17.200
Uh, this happens sometimes,
uh, you know,

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:19.701
if there's a network problem,
we can't get to the network,

00:11:19.701 --> 00:11:21.400
uh, we won't show an ad.

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:23.968
There are definitely things
you can do in that case

00:11:23.968 --> 00:11:27.000
to try to show something else
in that spot.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.033
That could be one of your own
house ads.

00:11:29.033 --> 00:11:31.334
That could be, um,
a different ad network.

00:11:31.334 --> 00:11:34.334
We don't--we have no problem
with you using other ad networks

00:11:34.334 --> 00:11:37.167
if you want, um, and then we'll
talk a little bit about that

00:11:37.167 --> 00:11:38.767
at the end, as well.

00:11:38.767 --> 00:11:41.767
So let me come back,

00:11:41.767 --> 00:11:44.534
and we will hand off to Dean

00:11:44.534 --> 00:11:47.701
to talk a little bit about IOS.

00:11:47.701 --> 00:11:50.200
Browne: Thanks, Mike.

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:52.200
[quietly]
Can you guys hear me?

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:54.200
[normal voice]
No? There we go.

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:56.067
Can you hear me now?
man: Yes.

00:11:56.067 --> 00:11:57.701
Browne: All right.
Hi, my name is Dean Browne.

00:11:57.701 --> 00:12:01.567
Uh, I am also with Google,
I came over from AdMob,

00:12:01.567 --> 00:12:04.367
and have been doing this
for a little while.

00:12:04.367 --> 00:12:06.367
I'm here today to talk about

00:12:06.367 --> 00:12:08.701
the IOS, uh, Google AdMob SDK.

00:12:08.701 --> 00:12:11.667
And moreover, I'm here to talk
about tablets.

00:12:11.667 --> 00:12:14.200
Um, I think everybody
in the room

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:17.667
has probably worked with ads
on mobile phones before,

00:12:17.667 --> 00:12:20.467
and there's a lot
of similarities in tablets,

00:12:20.467 --> 00:12:22.133
but there are
a few differences.

00:12:22.133 --> 00:12:25.133
There's just different ad sizes
and different sort of usage.

00:12:25.133 --> 00:12:27.667
But I'd encourage you all
to think about, uh,

00:12:27.667 --> 00:12:30.601
building your app and extending
it to tablet right off the bat.

00:12:30.601 --> 00:12:32.601
Um, tablets are--you know,

00:12:32.601 --> 00:12:34.601
it's where people go
for casual computing,

00:12:34.601 --> 00:12:36.601
and if you're gonna
have ads in something,

00:12:36.601 --> 00:12:38.601
it's likely a casual
sort of thing--

00:12:38.601 --> 00:12:41.601
a game, news reading,
whatever it is.

00:12:41.601 --> 00:12:43.767
Um, and so it's good to know

00:12:43.767 --> 00:12:45.767
a little bit about
what's available to you.

00:12:45.767 --> 00:12:47.767
So the first thing
I'd like to talk about

00:12:47.767 --> 00:12:50.767
is what ad sizes are available,
and sort of where to put them.

00:12:50.767 --> 00:12:52.801
I think when everybody
thinks of a phone,

00:12:52.801 --> 00:12:55.000
it's pretty standard now.
It's usually an ad

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.033
that goes across
the whole width of the phone,

00:12:57.033 --> 00:12:58.734
and you just kind of
put it somewhere.

00:12:58.734 --> 00:13:00.767
But what other sizes
are out there for tablets?

00:13:00.767 --> 00:13:03.834
So obviously, since I'm talking
IOS, I'm talking iPad here,

00:13:03.834 --> 00:13:07.234
but, uh, you guys all have
your fancy new Galaxy tablets,

00:13:07.234 --> 00:13:10.234
uh, and they're
the similar resolution.

00:13:10.234 --> 00:13:13.234
They're a little bit more, uh,
designed to be in landscape,

00:13:13.234 --> 00:13:15.734
but all the same ad sizes
are the ones we support,

00:13:15.734 --> 00:13:18.734
and they look roughly the same
as the slides you'll see.

00:13:18.734 --> 00:13:21.734
So the first, uh,
ad banner size

00:13:21.734 --> 00:13:24.734
that I'd like to talk about
is the medium rectangle.

00:13:24.734 --> 00:13:26.734
This is the most common ad size
you see online.

00:13:26.734 --> 00:13:28.734
I see it on ESPN
every day I go there.

00:13:28.734 --> 00:13:30.734
And it's the same one--

00:13:30.734 --> 00:13:32.901
the same size that
we support in the SDK.

00:13:32.901 --> 00:13:35.901
It's 300 pixels wide
by 250 pixels tall,

00:13:35.901 --> 00:13:37.901
and you can see it here.

00:13:37.901 --> 00:13:40.901
It fits really nicely inside
a UI split view.

00:13:40.901 --> 00:13:44.367
Um, UI split view
and a lot of iPad constructs

00:13:44.367 --> 00:13:46.367
are about 320 pixels wide,

00:13:46.367 --> 00:13:50.534
the--so that gives a nice little
10-pixel border around it.

00:13:50.534 --> 00:13:52.968
Uh, this also works really well

00:13:52.968 --> 00:13:55.367
on all the Honeycomb sizes,
as well.

00:13:55.367 --> 00:13:58.767
Uh, and there's
a medium rectangle in portrait.

00:13:58.767 --> 00:14:01.634
Uh, again, the exact same thing.

00:14:01.634 --> 00:14:04.701
It looks and works
really nicely.

00:14:04.701 --> 00:14:07.434
Uh, the next size I'm gonna
talk about is a leaderboard.

00:14:07.434 --> 00:14:10.234
This is the second most common
size that you'll find online.

00:14:10.234 --> 00:14:13.400
It's the same one. It's 728
pixels wide by 90 pixels tall.

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:15.400
In this case, it's portrait.

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:17.400
This is from the demo
that I built.

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:19.400
I'll show you
a little bit later.

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:21.400
And in this case, it goes,
uh, pretty well across

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:23.400
the width of all the screens.
It works--

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:25.400
it looks really nicely,
again, in landscape.

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:27.400
I've seen it used in
a lot of "Game Over" screens,

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:29.033
things like that.

00:14:29.033 --> 00:14:31.701
Um, this is a very common one
I've seen done on tablets.

00:14:31.701 --> 00:14:33.701
A lot of people choose this.

00:14:33.701 --> 00:14:35.701
Those are the main two sizes.

00:14:35.701 --> 00:14:37.701
There's a third size
that we support,

00:14:37.701 --> 00:14:39.367
which is the full banner.

00:14:39.367 --> 00:14:41.367
It's another online
standard size,

00:14:41.367 --> 00:14:43.367
and it's just used
less frequently.

00:14:43.367 --> 00:14:45.400
Uh, it's 468x60 pixels,

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:47.367
and the use case for this
is a lot--

00:14:47.367 --> 00:14:48.934
uh, especially in the iPad,

00:14:48.934 --> 00:14:50.501
there are a lot
of sort of overlays,

00:14:50.501 --> 00:14:52.501
so there's UI form sheets
and presentation controllers,

00:14:52.501 --> 00:14:55.601
things like that, and it's
a good size to fit in that.

00:14:55.601 --> 00:14:58.868
So here's a--here it is
in just a form sheet,

00:14:58.868 --> 00:15:01.334
and there it is
in a pop-over controller.

00:15:01.334 --> 00:15:03.501
In both cases, uh, you--

00:15:03.501 --> 00:15:06.834
the constructs don't have
quite as much screen real estate

00:15:06.834 --> 00:15:08.434
as the whole screen,

00:15:08.434 --> 00:15:10.434
and it's just another option
available to you.

00:15:10.434 --> 00:15:12.434
All of these banner sizes
work much better

00:15:12.434 --> 00:15:14.167
than a standard 320x50,

00:15:14.167 --> 00:15:16.167
which is just dwarfed
on the size of a tablet screen.

00:15:16.167 --> 00:15:18.200
It gives a lot more real estate
to advertisers,

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:20.167
and we see
really good performance.

00:15:20.167 --> 00:15:22.167
Um, in general,
I would also say that tablets

00:15:22.167 --> 00:15:25.167
we see really good, uh,
performance in, as well.

00:15:25.167 --> 00:15:28.167
Very comparable to phones,
in some cases, actually better.

00:15:28.167 --> 00:15:30.267
Uh, and the use cases
are very similar.

00:15:30.267 --> 00:15:32.934
I mean, people are spending
a lot of time with their tablets

00:15:32.934 --> 00:15:35.767
every day, looking at things,
they're discovering new content,

00:15:35.767 --> 00:15:38.767
and ads is a great way for them
to be able to do that.

00:15:38.767 --> 00:15:41.767
So with that,
I'm gonna go into the code.

00:15:41.767 --> 00:15:44.501
Uh, the code is very
similar to, uh,

00:15:44.501 --> 00:15:46.501
a normal iPhone, uh--

00:15:46.501 --> 00:15:48.501
putting it in an iPhone,

00:15:48.501 --> 00:15:50.501
like, a smaller,
uh, screen size,

00:15:50.501 --> 00:15:52.200
as well as the Android code.

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:54.167
I'm gonna talk a little--
I'll demo all this again.

00:15:54.167 --> 00:15:56.167
I'm gonna talk a little bit
about how you create the ad,

00:15:56.167 --> 00:15:58.000
how you actually make
the ad request,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
and then I'm gonna show
some effects,

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.067
uh, how to make the ad
look nice,

00:16:02.067 --> 00:16:04.567
so I'm gonna drop a shadow,
and I'll have the ad fade in.

00:16:04.567 --> 00:16:07.067
Um, all of these slides
are gonna be available online,

00:16:07.067 --> 00:16:08.701
as well as this talk,

00:16:08.701 --> 00:16:10.501
and the code
I will also release,

00:16:10.501 --> 00:16:12.067
so the slides
aren't as important--

00:16:12.067 --> 00:16:14.501
just wanted to cover
what we were talking through.

00:16:20.467 --> 00:16:22.467
All right.

00:16:22.467 --> 00:16:25.501
So this is the, uh,
this is a Feng Shui Compass.

00:16:25.501 --> 00:16:28.467
It's, uh, just done, uh,
right now without any ads.

00:16:28.467 --> 00:16:30.467
I'm gonna put an ad
at the bottom,

00:16:30.467 --> 00:16:32.968
like you saw in the screen shot,
just above the, uh,

00:16:32.968 --> 00:16:34.968
wood sort of paneling
in the background there.

00:16:34.968 --> 00:16:37.400
Um, in general, you know,
that app has a lot of--

00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:39.601
it looks really nice.
It's got a lot of detail.

00:16:39.601 --> 00:16:41.601
I'm not sure that really
shows up on a slide,

00:16:41.601 --> 00:16:44.400
but, uh, you want to make
your ad look nice.

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:46.567
You want it to appear
very professional

00:16:46.567 --> 00:16:48.400
along with the rest of it.

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:51.200
So how do we go about
integrating an ad,

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:53.667
and then how do we go about
making it look great

00:16:53.667 --> 00:16:55.667
in your application?

00:16:55.667 --> 00:16:58.701
So the first thing
that we want to do

00:16:58.701 --> 00:17:01.234
is we want to place the ad.

00:17:01.234 --> 00:17:03.234
So this is some boilerplate code

00:17:03.234 --> 00:17:05.234
that basically puts it above--

00:17:05.234 --> 00:17:07.234
positions the ad
above the wood panel.

00:17:07.234 --> 00:17:09.734
The one thing
I'd like to call out here

00:17:09.734 --> 00:17:12.968
is that we are setting
the size of the ad

00:17:12.968 --> 00:17:15.734
to the standard
leaderboard ad size.

00:17:15.734 --> 00:17:17.734
Once you set the frame
for the ad,

00:17:17.734 --> 00:17:20.234
the SDK will detect
that it's a leaderboard,

00:17:20.234 --> 00:17:23.367
and will properly make the right
ad calls on your behalf.

00:17:23.367 --> 00:17:25.801
The second thing
that we need to do

00:17:25.801 --> 00:17:28.701
is we need to, uh, tell the ad,

00:17:28.701 --> 00:17:31.701
What is the root view controller
of your application?

00:17:31.701 --> 00:17:34.701
This is important because, uh,
it's how the ad knows,

00:17:34.701 --> 00:17:37.167
when it's clicked,
how to take over the ex--

00:17:37.167 --> 00:17:40.467
how to take over your,
uh, your app,

00:17:40.467 --> 00:17:43.400
and start to show
the advertiser's content.

00:17:45.467 --> 00:17:48.634
The next thing
is the ad unit I.D.

00:17:48.634 --> 00:17:51.634
This is, in the AdMob case,
this is the AdMob site I.D.,

00:17:51.634 --> 00:17:53.767
just like Mike
had talked about before.

00:17:53.767 --> 00:17:57.033
You get this when you register
for, uh, on www.admob.com

00:17:57.033 --> 00:17:59.901
for your site,

00:17:59.901 --> 00:18:01.968
and that tells us

00:18:01.968 --> 00:18:04.601
how to position
and create the ad.

00:18:04.601 --> 00:18:07.601
And the final thing we need to
do is actually make a request.

00:18:07.601 --> 00:18:09.601
So the only part
that's important here

00:18:09.601 --> 00:18:11.601
is to just say, uh,
"bannerView LoadRequest."

00:18:11.601 --> 00:18:14.567
In this particular example,
I'm gonna request, uh,

00:18:14.567 --> 00:18:16.834
a test ad,

00:18:16.834 --> 00:18:19.234
and I've white-listed
only the simulator

00:18:19.234 --> 00:18:20.868
to receive test ads.

00:18:20.868 --> 00:18:23.868
My actual device in this case
would receive a real ad.

00:18:23.868 --> 00:18:26.868
So let's take a look and see
how this ad looks so far.

00:18:26.868 --> 00:18:29.801
So if I...

00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:34.767
just recompile it,

00:18:34.767 --> 00:18:37.968
you can see the ad appear
at the bottom.

00:18:37.968 --> 00:18:40.067
It's the same app
you saw before.

00:18:40.067 --> 00:18:42.100
Uh, it's a little bit
hard to make out,

00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:43.934
but there is a, uh,

00:18:43.934 --> 00:18:45.934
new test ad that we're showing.

00:18:45.934 --> 00:18:48.501
It's part of our new
App Galaxy campaign,

00:18:48.501 --> 00:18:50.501
and those of you
that went yesterday

00:18:50.501 --> 00:18:53.501
to the business portion of
making--of how to work with ads

00:18:53.501 --> 00:18:56.033
will see it--
uh, guidetotheappgalaxy.com,

00:18:56.033 --> 00:18:58.133
and see us later
for information on it.

00:18:58.133 --> 00:19:00.033
This is a web site
that's just fantastic.

00:19:00.033 --> 00:19:02.734
It just--it just shows you
about the business

00:19:02.734 --> 00:19:05.834
of how to make money
with mobile advertising,

00:19:05.834 --> 00:19:07.834
and just mobile in general.

00:19:07.834 --> 00:19:09.834
Um, I suggest that all of you
go there if you have,

00:19:09.834 --> 00:19:11.834
you know, questions,
if you're just trying to learn,

00:19:11.834 --> 00:19:13.834
or even if you know--
uh, you think you know a lot,

00:19:13.834 --> 00:19:15.834
there's still good content
in there.

00:19:15.834 --> 00:19:17.834
I-I was really impressed.
It's a fun site.

00:19:17.834 --> 00:19:20.801
So I have the ad appearing,
and I just want to click it,

00:19:20.801 --> 00:19:23.801
make sure that everything works.
It does.

00:19:23.801 --> 00:19:26.467
The App Galaxy ad--web site
is actually coming up

00:19:26.467 --> 00:19:28.100
when I click on it.

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:30.767
Um, however,

00:19:30.767 --> 00:19:33.033
it's a little bit hard,
again, to tell there,

00:19:33.033 --> 00:19:35.033
but the ad doesn't
really look as polished

00:19:35.033 --> 00:19:37.501
as the rest of the application.
You really want to make it look

00:19:37.501 --> 00:19:39.067
like it's part
of your experience.

00:19:39.067 --> 00:19:40.567
You just don't want
to dump it in.

00:19:40.567 --> 00:19:42.400
You want to make
things look good.

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:43.968
So how am I gonna do that?

00:19:43.968 --> 00:19:46.968
Well, I've used sort of lighting
and dropping shadows from things

00:19:46.968 --> 00:19:48.734
throughout the rest
of the application,

00:19:48.734 --> 00:19:50.734
so I want to do that
in the ad.

00:19:50.734 --> 00:19:53.601
And the way that I'll do that
is I'm just gonna use

00:19:53.601 --> 00:19:55.801
a normal CA layer drop shadow.

00:19:55.801 --> 00:19:58.501
There's nothing specific
to the SDK in this call.

00:19:58.501 --> 00:20:01.901
This just tells IOS to just
drop a shadow from the view.

00:20:01.901 --> 00:20:04.901
The next thing I want to do

00:20:04.901 --> 00:20:07.234
is I want to have
the ad fade in over time.

00:20:07.234 --> 00:20:09.968
And so the way to do this
is I tell the view

00:20:09.968 --> 00:20:11.968
to initially be transparent,

00:20:11.968 --> 00:20:14.734
and then I set a delegate.

00:20:14.734 --> 00:20:17.734
So a delegate is a lot
like a listener interface,

00:20:17.734 --> 00:20:20.100
for those of you who
are coming over from Android.

00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:23.100
It's just a bunch of methods
that I am optionally able

00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:26.100
to implement to get
notifications from the SDK

00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:27.734
when events happen.

00:20:27.734 --> 00:20:30.767
In this particular case, by
registering myself as a delegate

00:20:30.767 --> 00:20:33.367
and implementing the ad view
"DidReceiveAd" method,

00:20:33.367 --> 00:20:36.367
I'm able to, uh,

00:20:36.367 --> 00:20:38.834
tell--to be notified by the SDK

00:20:38.834 --> 00:20:41.868
when an ad successfully
comes in, and then do something.

00:20:41.868 --> 00:20:44.868
And in this case, all I'm doing
is making the transparent ad,

00:20:44.868 --> 00:20:48.100
uh, go to fully opaque
over .4 seconds.

00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:50.834
That's a standard, uh,
animation length you'll see

00:20:50.834 --> 00:20:52.501
in Android and IOS.

00:20:52.501 --> 00:20:54.467
It's sort of the,
"I saw something happen,

00:20:54.467 --> 00:20:56.467
but it's not too slow" speed.

00:20:56.467 --> 00:20:58.467
And so with that,

00:20:58.467 --> 00:21:02.534
when I recompile,

00:21:02.534 --> 00:21:04.868
you should notice the ad
in the same place,

00:21:04.868 --> 00:21:07.033
but it'll slowly
fade in for you,

00:21:07.033 --> 00:21:09.033
has a little bit
of a drop shadow.

00:21:09.033 --> 00:21:11.934
Again, I apologize for how
it looks on the projectors,

00:21:11.934 --> 00:21:13.934
but I encourage you
to all go grab the code

00:21:13.934 --> 00:21:15.567
and take a look at it.

00:21:15.567 --> 00:21:18.567
It's just a little bit sharper,
a little bit nicer experience.

00:21:18.567 --> 00:21:21.133
You know, I can still see
that when I click the ad,

00:21:21.133 --> 00:21:24.934
it still brings up my, uh--
it still works.

00:21:24.934 --> 00:21:27.501
Everything's fine. I know
that everything's good to go.

00:21:27.501 --> 00:21:29.501
And with this,
the app would be done.

00:21:29.501 --> 00:21:31.234
So with that, I am done.

00:21:31.234 --> 00:21:33.734
Please feel free to ask
questions later on.

00:21:33.734 --> 00:21:35.434
I'm gonna turn it over to Paul.

00:21:35.434 --> 00:21:37.434
He's gonna talk a little bit
about Windows.

00:21:37.434 --> 00:21:39.501
Thank you guys.
You'll like it.

00:21:39.501 --> 00:21:42.434
[applause]

00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:46.300
Hounshell: Hi,
I'm Paul Hounshell.

00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:49.033
I'm gonna show you
the Windows phone 7 ad SDK.

00:21:49.033 --> 00:21:52.033
With this SDK,
we've really gone to, uh,

00:21:52.033 --> 00:21:55.167
to match the functionality
in the phone versions

00:21:55.167 --> 00:21:57.334
of the other two SDKs, um,

00:21:57.334 --> 00:21:59.167
but we've taken advantage

00:21:59.167 --> 00:22:02.167
of some of the Windows phone 7
features to make it even easier.

00:22:02.167 --> 00:22:04.167
Um, today, I'm gonna
show you an example

00:22:04.167 --> 00:22:06.734
of how to add it to
a Silverlight-based application.

00:22:06.734 --> 00:22:09.267
If you don't know anything about
developing for Windows phone 7,

00:22:09.267 --> 00:22:11.267
there's two models--
Silverlight and XNA.

00:22:11.267 --> 00:22:13.501
And XNA is more of a game
programming model.

00:22:13.501 --> 00:22:16.200
Silverlight is more of
a form space programming model,

00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:18.200
and it's a little bit easier
to work with,

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:20.200
so it works well for a demo.

00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:22.901
Um, our steps are--
are even easier.

00:22:22.901 --> 00:22:25.901
We need to add the actual DLL
to your application,

00:22:25.901 --> 00:22:28.901
and then we need to add
the control to our--

00:22:28.901 --> 00:22:30.901
our layout.

00:22:30.901 --> 00:22:33.400
This is basically it.

00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:35.400
Um, you can see we've--

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:38.400
there's the ad reference
dialogue box,

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:40.667
and that's the XML
to add it to our display,

00:22:40.667 --> 00:22:42.534
and so with that,

00:22:42.534 --> 00:22:45.467
I'm just gonna cut to the chase
and show it.

00:22:47.534 --> 00:22:49.534
So because this is the simplest,

00:22:49.534 --> 00:22:51.534
I'm actually going
to live-code this.

00:22:51.534 --> 00:22:54.033
I'm taking a risk here,
but, uh...

00:22:54.033 --> 00:22:56.033
[laughs]

00:22:56.033 --> 00:22:58.534
It's actually
really straightforward

00:22:58.534 --> 00:23:00.534
to go through this process.

00:23:00.534 --> 00:23:02.601
Um, so like I said, well,

00:23:02.601 --> 00:23:04.601
the first step is to create
a brand-new solution

00:23:04.601 --> 00:23:06.601
that we've never
worked with before,

00:23:06.601 --> 00:23:08.601
and has absolutely nothing

00:23:08.601 --> 00:23:11.534
prepared ahead of time in it.

00:23:14.067 --> 00:23:17.901
And first, we add
our reference to the DLL...

00:23:19.734 --> 00:23:22.534
which is...

00:23:22.534 --> 00:23:24.534
already set for me.

00:23:24.534 --> 00:23:27.534
And then we need to add
the actual,

00:23:27.534 --> 00:23:30.534
uh, name space reference,

00:23:30.534 --> 00:23:33.534
which, thanks to the--

00:23:33.534 --> 00:23:35.534
to the benefit of IntelliSense,

00:23:35.534 --> 00:23:38.534
it will automatically do
most of the work for me.

00:23:38.534 --> 00:23:41.868
And then we need to add
the actual add control.

00:23:44.534 --> 00:23:46.467
Um...

00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:51.234
Then we grab that.

00:23:53.467 --> 00:23:55.467
And that is it.

00:23:55.467 --> 00:23:57.934
Our ad has been added
to our application,

00:23:57.934 --> 00:24:00.133
um, and this should show,

00:24:00.133 --> 00:24:03.200
uh, shortly,

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:06.200
when the emulator fires up.

00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:08.200
There's our application running,

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:11.200
and our ad should pop in--
right there.

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:12.901
Now again, like in IOS,

00:24:12.901 --> 00:24:15.701
we want to have a slightly
nicer aspect to this,

00:24:15.701 --> 00:24:17.868
um, and that .4 second animation

00:24:17.868 --> 00:24:20.767
really kind of makes it
a more gentle experience

00:24:20.767 --> 00:24:22.701
for the user, which in turn,

00:24:22.701 --> 00:24:25.033
leads the user to click
on things more often.

00:24:25.033 --> 00:24:27.033
So adding that is using standard

00:24:27.033 --> 00:24:30.033
built-in Windows phone 7
functionality.

00:24:30.033 --> 00:24:32.033
Uh,

00:24:32.033 --> 00:24:34.734
we can add
a storyboard animation,

00:24:34.734 --> 00:24:38.033
Uh...

00:24:38.033 --> 00:24:40.033
like so.

00:24:40.033 --> 00:24:42.033
And we're gonna animate the--

00:24:42.033 --> 00:24:44.968
the, uh, opacity.

00:24:46.534 --> 00:24:49.534
So...

00:24:49.534 --> 00:24:51.968
uh...

00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:12.300
Like so.

00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:15.300
And then I'm gonna give a name
to my ad,

00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:18.300
and then last, I'm gonna
add in an event handler,

00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:21.300
so that I can actually
handle this, uh,

00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:23.300
the ad being received,

00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:26.501
and fire up that animation.

00:25:35.501 --> 00:25:37.501
I believe

00:25:37.501 --> 00:25:39.167
that should be it,

00:25:39.167 --> 00:25:41.100
unless I missed a step...

00:25:48.968 --> 00:25:51.968
man: [speaking indistinctly]

00:25:51.968 --> 00:25:53.968
Hounshell: Thank you very much.

00:25:53.968 --> 00:25:56.934
I went a little too fast.

00:26:02.067 --> 00:26:04.067
And there, the ad
fades in nice and smooth.

00:26:04.067 --> 00:26:07.501
Um...
[applause]

00:26:07.501 --> 00:26:10.501
Hounshell: Again, this is using
no special SDK functionality.

00:26:10.501 --> 00:26:13.501
This is all using built-in
phone, uh, capabilities,

00:26:13.501 --> 00:26:15.501
and so we've really worked
to integrate it

00:26:15.501 --> 00:26:17.734
into the phone systems
in a nice, natural manner,

00:26:17.734 --> 00:26:19.734
so that these things
are possible.

00:26:19.734 --> 00:26:22.400
Um, with that, I'm gonna
turn it back to Mike

00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:25.434
for talking about targeting
and--or, metrics,

00:26:25.434 --> 00:26:29.000
and, thank you.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.934
[applause]

00:26:36.501 --> 00:26:39.067
Ying: Great, so now that
you guys know how to, uh,

00:26:39.067 --> 00:26:42.300
integrate the SDK, we can
talk a little bit about,

00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:44.801
uh, some of the more business
side of things.

00:26:44.801 --> 00:26:47.801
Um, so how many people out there

00:26:47.801 --> 00:26:49.801
remember from yesterday

00:26:49.801 --> 00:26:52.801
what "requests," "impressions,"
and "fill rate" all mean?

00:26:52.801 --> 00:26:55.300
Okay, so, uh, half of the people

00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:57.300
that went to
the session yesterday,

00:26:57.300 --> 00:26:59.901
uh, so we'll just over it
pretty quickly again for you.

00:26:59.901 --> 00:27:03.467
Um, basically, every time
you ask the ad server for an ad,

00:27:03.467 --> 00:27:05.467
that's an ad request.

00:27:05.467 --> 00:27:07.467
Um, some percentage
of that time,

00:27:07.467 --> 00:27:10.868
we will return you
an actual ad to show.

00:27:10.868 --> 00:27:12.601
Uh, that's an impression.

00:27:12.601 --> 00:27:14.767
And you basically
take that percentage--

00:27:14.767 --> 00:27:16.400
that's your fill rate.

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:19.801
Um, of the impressions
that you serve, um,

00:27:19.801 --> 00:27:22.701
people will either click
or they won't click on them.

00:27:22.701 --> 00:27:26.000
We measure that as your clicks
over your impressions,

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:27.934
or your clickthrough rate.

00:27:27.934 --> 00:27:30.801
And then, uh, based
on your clickthrough rate,

00:27:30.801 --> 00:27:32.467
you have your revenue,

00:27:32.467 --> 00:27:34.901
so if you have, you know,
1,000 requests

00:27:34.901 --> 00:27:37.501
and let's say you get
1,000 impressions back,

00:27:37.501 --> 00:27:41.267
uh, you have, um, you know,
50 clicks on that,

00:27:41.267 --> 00:27:43.567
and say you're getting paid
5 cents a click,

00:27:43.567 --> 00:27:45.868
you're gonna get paid
accordingly that way.

00:27:45.868 --> 00:27:49.067
Uh, your eCPM is another
metric we use

00:27:49.067 --> 00:27:52.100
to kind of measure the value
of your ads.

00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:55.667
Uh, what that means is effective
cost-per-thousand impressions,

00:27:55.667 --> 00:27:57.801
so what it means is, uh,

00:27:57.801 --> 00:27:59.801
depending on what the--

00:27:59.801 --> 00:28:01.868
what the cost per click is

00:28:01.868 --> 00:28:04.868
for a particular ad, um,
you're--

00:28:04.868 --> 00:28:07.868
the amount of money you make
based on 1,000 impressions

00:28:07.868 --> 00:28:11.167
is going to fluctuate,
so we call that an eCPM,

00:28:11.167 --> 00:28:14.167
and that's basically the average
for 1,000 impressions

00:28:14.167 --> 00:28:16.367
that you get
from a particular ad network.

00:28:16.367 --> 00:28:19.267
Um, as you guys probably, uh,
remember from yesterday--

00:28:19.267 --> 00:28:21.267
if you, uh,
didn't see the session,

00:28:21.267 --> 00:28:23.267
you should go
take a look at that--

00:28:23.267 --> 00:28:26.267
eCPM fluctuates quite a bit
from, uh, day to day,

00:28:26.267 --> 00:28:28.767
month to month,
and network to network.

00:28:28.767 --> 00:28:31.868
So, um, it's a good idea
to kind of keep an eye on that,

00:28:31.868 --> 00:28:34.634
and think about different ways
that you can help,

00:28:34.634 --> 00:28:36.634
uh, maximize your revenue

00:28:36.634 --> 00:28:39.634
between all this
eCPM fluctuation.

00:28:39.634 --> 00:28:42.133
So, um, you'll see

00:28:42.133 --> 00:28:44.133
in the AdMob UI,

00:28:44.133 --> 00:28:46.968
um, this is a way of kind of
tracking some of this

00:28:46.968 --> 00:28:48.968
business side information,
right?

00:28:48.968 --> 00:28:50.968
Your revenue, your eCPM,

00:28:50.968 --> 00:28:52.968
your requests,
your impressions--

00:28:52.968 --> 00:28:54.968
they'll all show up
like this.

00:28:54.968 --> 00:28:57.467
You'll be able to view it
day to day, month to month,

00:28:57.467 --> 00:29:00.534
over pretty much
whatever time period you wish.

00:29:00.534 --> 00:29:02.601
Um, so, you know,
you may go through,

00:29:02.601 --> 00:29:04.601
and you may see that, uh,

00:29:04.601 --> 00:29:06.601
on--for this particular app,

00:29:06.601 --> 00:29:09.534
the fill rate is pretty good
to start,

00:29:09.534 --> 00:29:11.534
and then it starts to drop off
a little bit.

00:29:11.534 --> 00:29:13.534
This is one of our test apps,

00:29:13.534 --> 00:29:16.000
so, uh, your mileage may vary.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.934
So talking about some
of the best practices,

00:29:18.934 --> 00:29:21.534
you know how to put an ad
in your app now,

00:29:21.534 --> 00:29:23.534
and we've talked to you
a little bit about

00:29:23.534 --> 00:29:25.934
how to kind of make the ad
look a little bit prettier,

00:29:25.934 --> 00:29:27.934
so that it doesn't--you know,

00:29:27.934 --> 00:29:29.934
so that it's not
just sitting there,

00:29:29.934 --> 00:29:32.200
uh, stuck on top of
whatever application you have.

00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:34.701
Um, it actually does pay
to, um,

00:29:34.701 --> 00:29:37.868
think about how you're going
to place your ad, and, uh,

00:29:37.868 --> 00:29:41.200
you know, where it's going
to live in your application.

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:43.934
Um, if you put--
if you put the ad in a place

00:29:43.934 --> 00:29:45.667
where no one's gonna look at it,

00:29:45.667 --> 00:29:47.667
no one's gonna click at it--
on it.

00:29:47.667 --> 00:29:50.167
Um, so, you know, one
of the things we like to do

00:29:50.167 --> 00:29:51.801
is we like to tell people,

00:29:51.801 --> 00:29:54.334
"Create a separate I.D.
for each of your ad placements."

00:29:54.334 --> 00:29:56.734
If you're gonna put one
on the front page of your app,

00:29:56.734 --> 00:29:58.734
if you're gonna put one
in between levels,

00:29:58.734 --> 00:30:00.734
uh, use separate I.D.'s
for those, uh,

00:30:00.734 --> 00:30:02.734
for those particular ads.

00:30:02.734 --> 00:30:05.067
Um, you know,
it may not be something

00:30:05.067 --> 00:30:07.501
you're thinking about now,
but in the future,

00:30:07.501 --> 00:30:10.167
you may want to be able
to control different things

00:30:10.167 --> 00:30:12.167
on those ads
at different times,

00:30:12.167 --> 00:30:15.167
so whether it's the presentation
and the color of that add,

00:30:15.167 --> 00:30:17.501
or whether you want
to turn the add off

00:30:17.501 --> 00:30:19.534
on particular parts
of your application,

00:30:19.534 --> 00:30:21.501
um, this gives you
that kind of flexibility.

00:30:21.501 --> 00:30:23.501
Um, because of that,
use descriptive names.

00:30:23.501 --> 00:30:25.501
Otherwise, you'll forget
which, uh--

00:30:25.501 --> 00:30:28.501
otherwise, you'll forget which,
uh, ad you're messing with,

00:30:28.501 --> 00:30:30.501
and it's good to, you know,

00:30:30.501 --> 00:30:33.234
don't play too many games
with your users.

00:30:33.234 --> 00:30:36.234
And then also remember,
use ads in the right place,

00:30:36.234 --> 00:30:38.067
and at the right time.

00:30:38.067 --> 00:30:41.067
Uh, just because we showed you
guys a little bit of animation,

00:30:41.067 --> 00:30:43.067
uh, it's not recommended
to have the ad

00:30:43.067 --> 00:30:45.567
slide in under a user's finger.

00:30:45.567 --> 00:30:48.234
We know when a click
is not very valuable,

00:30:48.234 --> 00:30:50.367
and, you know, obviously,
those things may--

00:30:50.367 --> 00:30:53.200
may seem like you might get some
more money, but it won't--

00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:55.367
it won't work out the right way
in the end for you.

00:30:55.367 --> 00:30:57.968
So, you know, things--
good times in a game

00:30:57.968 --> 00:30:59.634
would be between levels

00:30:59.634 --> 00:31:02.701
when the user's not particularly
worried about, you know,

00:31:02.701 --> 00:31:05.300
messing up their game,
or, you know,

00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:08.300
having to pause their game
just to get to the app--

00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:10.300
just to get to the ad content.

00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:12.534
And then also, you know,
stay away from controls.

00:31:12.534 --> 00:31:15.501
We've seen sometimes
where people will stick an ad,

00:31:15.501 --> 00:31:18.901
uh, right next to a menu bar,
or right next to, you know,

00:31:18.901 --> 00:31:20.634
some other kind of button,

00:31:20.634 --> 00:31:23.601
and it just tends to get you
sort of the accidental clicks

00:31:23.601 --> 00:31:26.200
that end up not converting,
and, you know,

00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:29.701
we're able to measure how
valuable these clicks are.

00:31:29.701 --> 00:31:32.701
So it's better to make sure that
the people who are clicking

00:31:32.701 --> 00:31:35.067
on your ads actually
want to see the ad content,

00:31:35.067 --> 00:31:38.367
and want to, you know,
see more about the information.

00:31:38.367 --> 00:31:41.234
So some other,

00:31:41.234 --> 00:31:44.234
uh, you know,
frequently asked questions.

00:31:44.234 --> 00:31:47.234
What happens when your app
changes orientation?

00:31:47.234 --> 00:31:49.234
Uh, the ads, you know,

00:31:49.234 --> 00:31:51.734
they act just like any other
piece of the UI.

00:31:51.734 --> 00:31:53.300
They will rotate.

00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:55.300
Um, one thing
that they do not do

00:31:55.300 --> 00:31:57.300
is they don't scale to--
across the landscape.

00:31:57.300 --> 00:32:00.701
So, um, that's sort of based
on the advertiser

00:32:00.701 --> 00:32:04.000
really likes to have a very
fixed size of their ad,

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.400
so 320x50 is a standard
that the IAB,

00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:10.434
which is the
Internet Advertising Bureau--

00:32:10.434 --> 00:32:12.534
it's the standard
that they establish.

00:32:12.534 --> 00:32:16.133
Um, so it does look
a little bit weird on landscape,

00:32:16.133 --> 00:32:18.968
but once again, we encourage you
to think of good ways

00:32:18.968 --> 00:32:21.934
of integrating that
into your landscape game

00:32:21.934 --> 00:32:24.000
or your landscape application.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.367
One thing we've seen
that works really well

00:32:26.367 --> 00:32:29.934
is, um, we've seen
some games that have taken

00:32:29.934 --> 00:32:32.834
the space that's remaining
between the side of the screen

00:32:32.834 --> 00:32:35.801
and the end of the ad, and using
that as part of the scoreboard,

00:32:35.801 --> 00:32:37.801
or something like that.

00:32:37.801 --> 00:32:40.300
Um, it's better not
to just have, you know,

00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:42.400
empty blank space
on each side of the ad.

00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:44.400
It's good to think about,
you know,

00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:46.400
What do you want to do
when you're showing

00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:48.634
in landscape, uh, orientation?

00:32:48.634 --> 00:32:50.634
And can my app be notified

00:32:50.634 --> 00:32:52.634
if an ad call succeeds or fails?

00:32:52.634 --> 00:32:55.100
Uh, yes, I think we showed you
the ad listener,

00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:57.133
or the delegate,

00:32:57.133 --> 00:33:00.267
or in all the cases of all
the callbacks that you'll get.

00:33:00.267 --> 00:33:03.501
Um, we have callbacks for
the ad loading or not loading,

00:33:03.501 --> 00:33:06.534
uh, when the application
is going to be closed,

00:33:06.534 --> 00:33:10.000
or somehow obscured by content,

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.000
and those things
are really good.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.000
It just gives your users
a good feeling,

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.000
like, it's okay for them
to click on the ad

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.801
if they know that
when they come back,

00:33:17.801 --> 00:33:19.801
their app is gonna be
in the same state as it was

00:33:19.801 --> 00:33:21.801
when they clicked on the app.

00:33:21.801 --> 00:33:24.801
And, uh, can I specify
extra targeting information

00:33:24.801 --> 00:33:26.734
to get better ads?
Absolutely.

00:33:26.734 --> 00:33:28.501
Uh, some of the things
we let you put in there

00:33:28.501 --> 00:33:30.501
are keywords, um,

00:33:30.501 --> 00:33:32.501
we'll let you put
location information in there.

00:33:32.501 --> 00:33:35.501
One caveat is that we ask you
only to give us

00:33:35.501 --> 00:33:38.501
location information
if it's part of your app's,

00:33:38.501 --> 00:33:40.501
um, you know, normal usage,

00:33:40.501 --> 00:33:42.801
so if you are just a--

00:33:42.801 --> 00:33:45.133
if you're a news application,

00:33:45.133 --> 00:33:47.567
it might not be appropriate
to gather the location

00:33:47.567 --> 00:33:49.567
just for the purposes of ads.

00:33:49.567 --> 00:33:51.567
But say you're some sort
of mapping application,

00:33:51.567 --> 00:33:53.567
and, you know, you're already
getting a location

00:33:53.567 --> 00:33:56.167
as part of your user's normal,
um, you know,

00:33:56.167 --> 00:33:58.167
walk through the application,

00:33:58.167 --> 00:34:00.167
then that's something
you can give to us,

00:34:00.167 --> 00:34:02.567
and we'll use that
to help target our ads.

00:34:02.567 --> 00:34:05.200
And then also, uh,
what does "no fill" mean?

00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:07.434
A lot of times,
you'll see "no fill."

00:34:07.434 --> 00:34:09.934
That's going back to the idea
that not every impress--

00:34:09.934 --> 00:34:13.067
not every request will get
filled with an impression,

00:34:13.067 --> 00:34:15.501
so there are some cases
in which we'll feel

00:34:15.501 --> 00:34:17.934
that it's not appropriate
to give back an ad,

00:34:17.934 --> 00:34:21.000
and so not every request will
be filled with an impression.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:24.167
That's okay. Uh, sometimes
it's just not the right time.

00:34:24.167 --> 00:34:25.767
It's a temporary condition.

00:34:25.767 --> 00:34:29.100
As you saw, sometimes future
requests will return ads.

00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:31.100
And, uh,

00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:33.634
this is going back
to the whole thing about eCPM

00:34:33.634 --> 00:34:36.634
and fluctuation of fill rate,
plus eCPM.

00:34:36.634 --> 00:34:39.234
We encourage you
to use mediation.

00:34:39.234 --> 00:34:41.234
Uh, if you need to learn more
about mediation,

00:34:41.234 --> 00:34:43.234
you can go to
Guide to the App Galaxy,

00:34:43.234 --> 00:34:46.100
or reference back to the session
that we had yesterday.

00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:48.400
Uh, it talks about some
of the mediation solutions

00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:50.400
like adworld, at adworld.com,

00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:52.601
to kind of go between
different ad networks

00:34:52.601 --> 00:34:54.968
and be able to maximize
your revenue.

00:34:56.767 --> 00:35:00.434
And so, uh,
some of those resources, um,

00:35:00.434 --> 00:35:02.167
the code site is

00:35:02.167 --> 00:35:05.100
code.google.com/mobile/ads.

00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:07.767
We have, uh, information
about our SDKs

00:35:07.767 --> 00:35:10.133
as well as example code.

00:35:10.133 --> 00:35:12.200
We're gonna post
all of the examples

00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:14.200
we showed today up there.

00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:17.200
Also, inside each
of the distributions,

00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:20.200
we'll have README and JavaDocs
as appropriate.

00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:22.200
And then we have two groups.

00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:25.067
Uh, one is more, uh, publisher-
and business-oriented.

00:35:25.067 --> 00:35:27.067
That's for
nontechnical support--

00:35:27.067 --> 00:35:29.067
that's that
AdMob Publisher Discuss there--

00:35:29.067 --> 00:35:31.434
and then for the more
technical side of things,

00:35:31.434 --> 00:35:34.434
you can go
to Google AdMob Ads SDK.

00:35:34.434 --> 00:35:36.934
And then also, uh,
as you saw before,

00:35:36.934 --> 00:35:39.434
we've got
the Guide to the App Galaxy.

00:35:39.434 --> 00:35:41.968
That's how you
can really get an idea of,

00:35:41.968 --> 00:35:45.501
okay, you've got this great app,
now what?

00:35:45.501 --> 00:35:48.167
It'll give you a good idea
of all the different ways

00:35:48.167 --> 00:35:50.434
that you can monetize,
uh, your application.

00:35:50.434 --> 00:35:52.434
That's either
with paid downloads,

00:35:52.434 --> 00:35:54.434
freemium models, uh,

00:35:54.434 --> 00:35:56.434
house ads, direct sold ads,

00:35:56.434 --> 00:35:59.434
and then regular
ad-supported applications.

00:35:59.434 --> 00:36:02.501
All right, and with that,

00:36:02.501 --> 00:36:04.501
uh, if there are any questions,

00:36:04.501 --> 00:36:07.934
feel free to use the mics
up in the front.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.000
man: Yeah, Bob James here.

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:15.801
Um, you mentioned, uh, the f--

00:36:15.801 --> 00:36:18.000
leading, uh, in the full.

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.000
Can you--what's the difference?
They're kind of the same thing.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.000
The dimensions
are slightly different.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.501
Ying: Oh, so you were talking
about the leaderboard format?

00:36:25.501 --> 00:36:27.501
man: Leaderboard versus full,
I think it was.

00:36:27.501 --> 00:36:29.501
Browne: Versus the full banner?
man: Yeah, full banner.

00:36:29.501 --> 00:36:31.501
Browne: Yeah, one is just
smaller than the other, yeah.

00:36:31.501 --> 00:36:33.501
They're roughly
the same aspect ratio.

00:36:33.501 --> 00:36:35.501
Um, the leaderboard
is just a much bigger size.

00:36:35.501 --> 00:36:38.000
It's the one that you sort of
see at the top of the fold

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:39.501
on most web sites you go to.

00:36:39.501 --> 00:36:41.801
It's like the sort of
topmost ad size.

00:36:41.801 --> 00:36:43.734
It's, uh, it's a little bit
more common.

00:36:43.734 --> 00:36:47.501
It's roughly, like, 70% wider,
so it's pretty good.

00:36:47.501 --> 00:36:50.701
So if you take, like, the new
Galaxy tab that you just got,

00:36:50.701 --> 00:36:52.801
it's gonna be 1280x800.

00:36:52.801 --> 00:36:54.734
It's like roughly
the size of, like,

00:36:54.734 --> 00:36:56.400
an A14
legal sheet of paper.

00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:58.400
Most people hold it kind of
sideways, or whatever,

00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:00.667
and so you'll see that
that ad will occupy

00:37:00.667 --> 00:37:03.267
about 60% of the screen's width,

00:37:03.267 --> 00:37:05.801
and just, you know--
I'd have to do the math,

00:37:05.801 --> 00:37:08.434
but, like, 10%, 12%
of the height,

00:37:08.434 --> 00:37:10.367
so...
man: Great.

00:37:14.601 --> 00:37:16.601
Browne: Anybody else?

00:37:16.601 --> 00:37:19.300
Ying: Okay, if there
are no other questions,

00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:22.501
um, feel free--we have
office hours today until 5:00.

00:37:22.501 --> 00:37:24.067
We're on the third floor.

00:37:24.067 --> 00:37:26.300
Um, it's basically exactly

00:37:26.300 --> 00:37:29.100
in this same spot,
just, uh, upstairs.

00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:31.734
Feel free to come by if you have
any questions about the code

00:37:31.734 --> 00:37:33.767
or any of the things
that we've shown you.

00:37:33.767 --> 00:37:36.400
We're happy to sit down and talk
to you about all this stuff

00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:38.767
or, you know, how to build
your business, as well.

00:37:38.767 --> 00:37:41.767
Um, and then leave us
some feedback, tweet,

00:37:41.767 --> 00:37:44.534
and, uh, thank you very much.
Browne: Thank you, everybody.
