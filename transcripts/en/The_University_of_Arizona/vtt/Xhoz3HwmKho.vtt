00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.850
It is my real pleasure to
introduce Eliott Cheu, who

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:11.950
will be the speaker today.

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:15.160
Elliott has a first
class pedigree.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:20.050
He comes from Stanford
and Cornell and Chicago.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.630
He came here when the
University of Arizona

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.850
was sort of leading a
charge to try to create--

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:28.930
be part of a collider that
was going to take over

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:31.240
an enormous area in Texas.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.540
It was killed by the government
because it was too expensive.

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.430
And from there,
somehow or another,

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.500
we ended up with the
Large Hadron Collider,

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.630
which is in Switzerland,
which is what we're going

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:42.700
to be talking about today.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.440
Elliott is part of the group
at the University of Arizona

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.380
that has been part of
one of the detectors

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:54.700
that famously measured
the Higgs boson--

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.560
again, one of these
incredible things that's

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.460
been happening
lately in physics.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.290
That was a few years back.

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.920
Elliott bet on the wrong
horse at that point.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.500
He was betting on a thing
called supersymmetry.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.730
So then he decided to quit that.

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.070
I'm just kidding.

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.180
So Elliott has gone from his
interest in supersymmetry

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.990
to dark matter.

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.580
And I think everybody
here has already

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.530
heard it one way or
another, that the universe

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.350
is composed mostly of dark
matter and dark energy.

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.780
We don't really know what any
of these things are about.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.330
And Elliott has
been working hard

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.420
at trying to figure out what
dark matter is all about.

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.830
But Elliott is one of these
sort of multiple threat

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:36.030
kind of guys.

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.110
Elliott was my associate dean
in the College of Science.

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.200
So if you ever go to
the Tucson book festival

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.420
and you talk about
the science city,

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.390
it was Elliott that got
all that stuff going.

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.310
When you talk about
science cafes,

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.960
Elliott's fingerprints
are all over that.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.670
When you talk about many of
our undergraduate students

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.310
in the College of Science--
about 70% of them--

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.710
being involved in undergraduate
research education--

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.250
in other words, they're stuck
in a lab somewhere doing some

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.720
fantastic research--

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.060
Elliott's fingerprints
are all over that.

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.830
Elliott just took over being
the interim dean of the Honors

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.400
College, which will
benefit us greatly,

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.950
and of course, many
of our students.

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.140
And last year, he
was also honored

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.670
by the university by being a
distinguished professor which

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.670
is one of the highest
honors that the university

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.410
can bestow on its faculty.

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:36.130
So it's my great pleasure to
introduce to you Elliott Cheu.

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:37.130
Thank you very much.

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:38.130
Thanks a lot.

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:47.484
Thank you, everybody.

00:02:47.484 --> 00:02:49.150
I guess one of the
problems with working

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:50.920
with the dean-- it's not
really a problem-- is

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.336
that sometimes you
tell him things

00:02:52.336 --> 00:02:53.980
and they become his first joke.

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.372
So, I did work on supersymmetry.

00:02:56.372 --> 00:02:58.330
We're now turning our
attention to dark matter.

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.190
And I'm [INAUDIBLE]
tell you that earlier.

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.650
Also, it's a real
challenge to come

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.742
after a 15-year-old prodigy.

00:03:05.742 --> 00:03:06.700
And I don't know what--

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.050
I have nothing left to say.

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.109
So hopefully you'll
hear something.

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:12.400
But actually the other thing
is, being the Interim Dean

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.580
of the Honors College-- at
least until they kick me out--

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.500
is that we can probably
offer him a place.

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.390
And he would be a perfect
example of somebody

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.675
who would make a great
fit at the Honors College.

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.930
So, as you've seen, we
have a flock of physicists.

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:31.770
That wasn't my term.

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:33.540
But we have a flock
of physicists up here

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.206
who have told you
about things like what

00:03:35.206 --> 00:03:38.910
physicists do, to black
holes, to gravitational waves.

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.580
And today I'll talk to you
about particle physics.

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.110
And if you look at
these pictures--

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.330
and then the last one you'll
hear next week is Pierre

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.246
Meystre, who's somewhere
in the audience here,

00:03:47.246 --> 00:03:48.870
who will talk about
quantum physics--

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.480
you'll notice something very
striking about all these faces

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:52.770
that you see here.

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:55.890
And yes, you're correct
that four of these people

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.640
are theorists and I'm
the lone experimentalist.

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:04.020
So, today's talk
will be about to look

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:07.140
at what we do from the
experimental point of view.

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:12.510
And really, the idea is
that while we have this kind

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:16.764
of ongoing, I would say,
rivalry between the theorists

00:04:16.764 --> 00:04:18.722
and the physicists-- and
the experimentalists--

00:04:18.722 --> 00:04:20.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.590
Sorry.

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:24.020
I swear, that was a slip of the
tongue-- between the theorists

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.634
and the experimentalists, we
actually work hand in hand.

00:04:26.634 --> 00:04:28.050
And I'll try to
show some of that.

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:31.945
But sometimes the theory
is going to precede what--

00:04:31.945 --> 00:04:33.445
theorists will come
up with a theory

00:04:33.445 --> 00:04:34.825
and that will
actually drive what

00:04:34.825 --> 00:04:36.450
the experimentalists will do.

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:38.700
Sometimes, the experiments
will find something

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:41.430
that the theorists had
no idea even existed.

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.950
But what's most interesting,
at least from my point of view,

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:46.557
is that when the theory
and the experiment

00:04:46.557 --> 00:04:48.390
come into conflict,
when there's a tension--

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:51.540
whether there's an experiment
that sees something

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.610
that the theory doesn't
expect or something,

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.520
or the theory expects something
that the experiments don't

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:57.039
see--

00:04:57.039 --> 00:04:59.580
that actually leads to some of
these big revolutionary things

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:00.079
that happen.

00:05:00.079 --> 00:05:03.060
And so I hope to kind
of bring that out today.

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.310
But in particular, what
I'm going to talk about--

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:05.810
whoops.

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:08.190
That went-- sorry.

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:09.880
That is right.

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.860
What I'm going to talk
about today is basically

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:15.700
what are we made of, what
holds these things together,

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:18.127
and then, kind of the big
question, what's missing?

00:05:18.127 --> 00:05:19.960
And I'll help to give
you an example of that

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.980
when we talk about dark energy.

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:23.544
But let me walk
back a little bit

00:05:23.544 --> 00:05:25.710
and talk about this thing
called the Standard Model.

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:27.520
And Dr. Dienes did
a really good job

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.270
of explaining what
all these dots mean.

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:33.370
Basically, the way
I think about it

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:35.904
is that everything on the
left-hand side, those 12

00:05:35.904 --> 00:05:38.320
particles, are what everything
that we know of is made of.

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:39.670
It's the matter.

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:41.980
And Dr. Dienes said
that if we were

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:45.850
to break this down to grammar,
those would be the nouns.

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:48.027
The things on the
right are the forces.

00:05:48.027 --> 00:05:50.110
Those are the things that
actually hold everything

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:50.630
together.

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:52.990
So for instance, the
photon is the carrier

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:54.550
of the electromagnetic force.

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:56.050
That's actually the
thing that holds

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:58.425
everything that we're looking--
the stage I'm standing on

00:05:58.425 --> 00:06:01.522
is solid because of the
electromagnetic force.

00:06:01.522 --> 00:06:02.980
And then we come
to the Higgs-- oh.

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:05.009
And by the way, the
forces are like the verbs.

00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:07.300
Remember, he said that we
have nouns and we have verbs.

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:10.690
Well, the Higgs does
two things, actually.

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:12.760
Dr. Dienes said that
it's the adverb.

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:14.830
It modifies these forces.

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:17.620
But actually, it also
does something else.

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:20.920
The Higgs, in addition to
modifying the four forces

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:23.380
that you see on the right,
or creating-- giving rise

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:26.480
to the four forces that
we see, also gives mass

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.970
to the matter particles.

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:30.640
So in fact, the
Higgs in some ways

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:34.210
can be thought of as an
adjective or an adverb.

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:36.670
This morning I tried to
Google a word that meant,

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:38.322
what's an adverb
and an adjective.

00:06:38.322 --> 00:06:39.280
Couldn't find anything.

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.741
So at the breakfast table,
I asked my daughter--

00:06:41.741 --> 00:06:43.240
she's going to be
embarrassed, but--

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:44.800
I asked her, so
what is a word that

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:48.317
means that a word can be both
an adjective and an adverb?

00:06:48.317 --> 00:06:49.900
And she said, why
do you want to know?

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:51.340
And I said, well, you know,
I'm giving a lecture tonight

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:53.170
and I thought I'd use
that in my lecture.

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:55.378
And she says, well then,
you should have figured that

00:06:55.378 --> 00:06:57.430
out a week ago.

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:00.370
Anyway, there we go.

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:03.337
So this model that we
have describes everything

00:07:03.337 --> 00:07:04.420
that we know about matter.

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:08.410
That is, this is what
we know about matter.

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:12.250
And it actually is interesting,
because if you look at--

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:15.100
Nobel prizes were given
out first in 1901.

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:19.090
And in the years since
1901, up to very recently,

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:20.530
this is the number
of Nobel prizes

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:24.352
that actually were awarded for
the discovery of that model

00:07:24.352 --> 00:07:25.310
that I just showed you.

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:28.450
So about 40 Nobel
prizes were actually

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:30.137
devoted to discovering this.

00:07:30.137 --> 00:07:31.720
And that actually
kind of demonstrates

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:34.090
you the significance
of this enterprise

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:37.020
that we were launched upon.

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:39.150
But what I want to talk
about is, in particular,

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:40.350
the one about the
Higgs mechanism.

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:41.980
Because that's the one
that's been most recent.

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:44.550
That's the one that you've
heard about in recent times.

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:47.394
And the Higgs mechanism
started with these three men.

00:07:47.394 --> 00:07:48.810
Actually, the
unfortunate thing is

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:50.610
everybody knows it as
the Higgs mechanism.

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:53.970
It's actually, to physicists,
called the Brout Englert Higgs

00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:56.310
mechanism, the BEH mechanism.

00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:59.820
Unfortunately, all of you know
it just as the Higgs mechanism.

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:02.730
And what they had done was
that they had figured out

00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:05.130
a way to actually
talk about both

00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:07.140
the electromagnetic
force and the weak force

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:08.670
in a consistent way.

00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:13.020
And that way has now become
called the Higgs mechanism.

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:14.924
Interestingly,
Victor Weiskopf said,

00:08:14.924 --> 00:08:17.340
"particle physicists are so
desperate these days that they

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:19.715
have to borrow from the new
things coming up in many body

00:08:19.715 --> 00:08:21.510
physics-- like BCS--"
which is the theory

00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:23.034
of superconductivity--

00:08:23.034 --> 00:08:24.700
"and perhaps something
will come of it,"

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:25.950
said Victor Weiskopf in 1960.

00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:28.440
Well, what came of it
was the Higgs mechanism.

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:30.930
So they actually were
looking at other theories.

00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:33.720
The first paper that
Peter Higgs actually wrote

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:37.500
was sent to the top journal in
Europe called Physics Letters.

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:39.701
And that journal rejected it.

00:08:39.701 --> 00:08:41.159
So he turned around
and rewrote it.

00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:42.700
And they actually
predicted something

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:44.760
called the Higgs
particle-- resubmitted it

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:47.100
to a journal called
Physics Review Letters.

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:49.470
And Pierre Meystre, who's
going to talk next week,

00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:51.414
is the editor of that journal.

00:08:51.414 --> 00:08:53.580
And that's the most prestigious
journal, by the way,

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:54.500
in physics in the US.

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:56.250
Actually, I would
almost say in the world.

00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:59.040
But that's just me.

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:00.180
It was accepted.

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:03.960
And at the same time, the paper
by Robert Brout and Francois

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:06.070
Englert also was submitted,
just about a couple

00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:07.180
of weeks ahead of time.

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:08.550
They were published together.

00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:10.270
And what were they looking for?

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:17.460
Well, prior to recently,
what their theory said

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:19.590
was that we should find a
particle called the Higgs

00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:20.740
particle.

00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:24.300
And up until 2000-- well,
until recently, but at the time

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:27.150
that I started getting
particularly involved

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:29.927
in the LHC, nobody
had found the Higgs.

00:09:29.927 --> 00:09:31.010
It's actually interesting.

00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:32.940
I was listening to a
lecture by Brian Greene

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:36.300
and he said that when he went
to graduate school in the '80s,

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:38.790
it was so thought that
this Higgs mechanism must

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:41.400
be the theory of
the standard model

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:43.609
that he didn't realize that
nobody had actually found

00:09:43.609 --> 00:09:45.650
the Higgs particle when
he was a graduate student

00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:47.940
for many, many months, until
after he had been there,

00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:48.960
somebody said, oh by
the way, you know,

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:50.820
that thing hasn't
been found yet.

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:53.970
And he then realized that it
was an ongoing experiment.

00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:58.480
So what I want to do now is
talk about, how do we get there?

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:01.620
So in my world, you
have to do an experiment

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:03.404
and you have to do two things.

00:10:03.404 --> 00:10:05.820
The first thing is you have
to find a source of particles.

00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:08.350
You have to be able to
create this Higgs particle.

00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:10.900
And we do that by
accelerating particles.

00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:12.480
Now the next part
of it is that you

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:15.780
have to then be able to detect
those particles-- find out

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:16.980
what you actually found.

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:19.230
And I'm going to kind of
walk you through a little bit

00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:22.500
about the history of how
we went about doing that.

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:26.310
The very first particles
that we found--

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:28.940
so, as I talk about these
accelerating particles--

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:30.510
are particles--

00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:32.220
oh, sorry.

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:34.300
What we actually
have to do, though,

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:36.900
is we have to produce a
particle like the Higgs.

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:39.780
And in order to do that, you
can't just create a Higgs.

00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:43.290
You have to provide a
mechanism to do that.

00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:47.250
So what we do is we take
particle A and particle B

00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:49.157
and we collide them together.

00:10:49.157 --> 00:10:50.740
And if you provide
those two particles

00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:54.000
A and B with enough energy,
what they will do is sometimes,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.210
they'll produce a particle
C. And that particle C--

00:10:57.210 --> 00:10:59.880
So this equation that you
see on the left-hand side,

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:03.060
E equals mc squared, is that
famous Einstein equation.

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:06.550
And what it really says is that
energy and mass are equivalent.

00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:07.870
They're the same thing.

00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:11.830
So if you want to produce a
particle of a particular mass,

00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:13.845
if you provide enough
energy, that particle

00:11:13.845 --> 00:11:17.560
will mysteriously
just pop out of air.

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:19.920
And so the interesting
thing is that in order

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:22.890
to do that, to produce a
particle with a given mass,

00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:24.990
you have to provide
enough energy.

00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:27.630
But the mass of the particle
that you can produce,

00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:30.370
the energy is divided
by that C squared.

00:11:30.370 --> 00:11:31.900
So C is the speed of light.

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:34.770
Remember last week, or two weeks
ago, when Sam Gralla talked

00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:35.910
about the speed of light--

00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:37.510
it's a big number.

00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:39.510
So if you square it, it's
an even bigger number.

00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:40.510
I don't know what it is.

00:11:40.510 --> 00:11:42.010
But it's a really big number.

00:11:42.010 --> 00:11:44.520
So in order to
produce a particle,

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:47.070
you have to provide
enough energy in the two

00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:50.190
particles A and B to
produce that particle C. So,

00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:51.430
how do we do that?

00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:54.870
Well the earliest experiments
were done by using cosmic rays.

00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:57.990
What you see here is a picture
of the Aurora Borealis, which

00:11:57.990 --> 00:12:03.000
is the result of the solar wind
and then other cosmic particles

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.980
being funneled by the
Earth's magnetic field

00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:06.180
to the north and south pole.

00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:09.472
And when those particles
hit the atmosphere,

00:12:09.472 --> 00:12:10.680
they produce other particles.

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:12.263
And some of those
particles are light.

00:12:12.263 --> 00:12:14.160
And that's why you get
these pretty colors.

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:16.290
But in doing that, you
can actually provide--

00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:19.830
you can have a very high energy
particle hitting the atmosphere

00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:22.440
and producing another particle.

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:25.140
The problem with
using the cosmic ray--

00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:27.540
the flux of particles that
are hitting the Earth's

00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:30.370
atmosphere-- is that you don't
know where they're going to be.

00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:33.420
And it turns out it doesn't
happen that frequently.

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:35.430
It's about on the order
of, like, one per second

00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:36.420
or something like that.

00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:39.900
So while it happens, if you
want to accumulate a billion

00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:43.520
of these things, you're going
to wait a very long time.

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:45.910
So the next mechanism
was to actually build

00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:50.740
something that actually produces
a set of energetic particles.

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:52.840
And Lawrence here was one
of the first inventors

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:55.736
to actually produce
something called a cyclotron.

00:12:55.736 --> 00:12:57.360
The way the cyclotron
works is that you

00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:00.990
inject in the very
center here a particle

00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:02.970
which doesn't have
very much energy.

00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:05.460
And when a particle moves
in a magnetic field,

00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:06.870
it goes in a circular direction.

00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:08.640
It moves in a circular path.

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:12.190
So as the particle gets
ejected from the center,

00:13:12.190 --> 00:13:15.600
there's a high voltage supply
which accelerates that particle

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:16.890
just a little bit.

00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:20.100
And so as the particle
goes across this gap--

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:22.830
each side is called a dee--
as it crosses that gap,

00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:24.840
the particle gains a
little bit of energy.

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:27.600
As it gains energy,
its momentum increases.

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:30.300
And when that momentum
increases, its curvature--

00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:31.620
the path it's tracing--

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:32.700
gets a little bit less.

00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:34.350
So instead of being
a small circle,

00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:35.520
it gets a bigger circle.

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:37.061
So what happens is
that the particles

00:13:37.061 --> 00:13:39.810
start at that position A
and wind their way outward.

00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:41.370
And each time they
cross that gap,

00:13:41.370 --> 00:13:42.920
they get a little
bit more energy.

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:46.170
So at the very end,
they exit the apparatus

00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:48.000
with a very high energy.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.010
And so that's a
very neat apparatus.

00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:51.990
The only problem with
an apparatus like this

00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:55.060
is it requires a magnet
at the top and the bottom.

00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:57.930
So if you want to make a bigger
apparatus, in other words, one

00:13:57.930 --> 00:13:59.917
that can have more and
more accelerations,

00:13:59.917 --> 00:14:01.750
you have to have a
bigger and bigger magnet.

00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:04.860
And at some point, you just
can't make a magnet that big.

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:09.090
His very first apparatus
was limited by the size.

00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:11.910
And it could produce
a particle that

00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:14.760
had an energy of five
million electron volts.

00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:16.590
Five million sounds
like a big number.

00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:18.339
The number we're going
to be talking about

00:14:18.339 --> 00:14:20.130
is hundreds of billions
of electron volts.

00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:21.900
So we're talking about
sizes that are not

00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:24.540
reachable with this technology.

00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:26.510
So the next
technology-- well, OK.

00:14:26.510 --> 00:14:29.000
So then, there's
one problem that you

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.500
have to get high energies.

00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:33.870
The other thing you have
to do is get high rates.

00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:37.470
In the 1950s, Frederick
Reines and Clyde Cowan

00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:39.960
wanted to try to look for
this elusive particle called

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:43.590
the neutrino, which had
been postulated by Wolfgang

00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:46.227
Pauli in the 1930s, when
he noticed that there

00:14:46.227 --> 00:14:48.060
was this weird structure
in something called

00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:49.620
the beta decays.

00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:52.560
And what it caused him
to do was postulate

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:55.620
a particle that didn't exist
and nobody had ever seen.

00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:58.260
And not only was it not
seen, but it would be

00:14:58.260 --> 00:14:59.760
almost impossible to measure.

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:03.420
Because a single neutrino, if
it went through a certain amount

00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:05.730
of lead, would have to
go through a light year

00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:08.590
worth of lead before it would
interact with that lead.

00:15:08.590 --> 00:15:09.090
OK.

00:15:09.090 --> 00:15:10.590
That kind of sounds
impossible, right?

00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:12.839
We can't even make things
that are longer than a mile.

00:15:12.839 --> 00:15:14.039
So a light year is--

00:15:14.039 --> 00:15:15.330
I mean, that's a long distance.

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:17.079
The astronomers can
tell you what that is.

00:15:17.079 --> 00:15:19.890
But I know it's a long distance.

00:15:19.890 --> 00:15:22.170
So instead of having a
light year worth of lead,

00:15:22.170 --> 00:15:23.730
the other thing
you can do is have

00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:24.960
lots and lots of neutrinos.

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:27.080
Because eventually, if
you get tons of them--

00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:29.490
not tons-- but if you get lots
of neutrinos, some of them

00:15:29.490 --> 00:15:30.786
will interact in your detector.

00:15:30.786 --> 00:15:32.160
And that's what
he decided to do.

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:36.000
So he decided, well, if I want
to get a lot of neutrinos,

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.110
what am I going to do?

00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:42.200
And his answer was to
find an atomic bomb.

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:44.330
So you might say, well,
that's not a good reason.

00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:46.871
But it turns out, in the 50s,
of course people were exploding

00:15:46.871 --> 00:15:48.640
bombs all over the place.

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:49.640
And that was his source.

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:51.431
He actually wrote a
proposal where he said,

00:15:51.431 --> 00:15:55.730
I'd like to use an atomic
bomb to search for neutrinos.

00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:58.760
Well, it actually was accepted.

00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:01.449
But he then realized, after
a few more calculations,

00:16:01.449 --> 00:16:02.990
that there's a better
way to do that.

00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:04.550
And he went to a
nuclear reactor.

00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:06.590
This is the Savannah
River reactor,

00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:08.630
where he could sit
outside the reactor

00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:10.310
and look for a
source of neutrinos.

00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:12.620
If you turn off the reactor,
the source should go away.

00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:15.140
And eventually, he actually
discovered the neutrino.

00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:17.480
And when he did, he sent a
telegram to Wolfgang Pauli--

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:19.700
now this is 20-some-odd
years later--

00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:22.070
saying, we found the
neutrino and in fact, it

00:16:22.070 --> 00:16:26.570
does take a light year of
lead to have one interact.

00:16:26.570 --> 00:16:28.310
The only problem
with a reactor is

00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:30.710
that the particles that
are produced from it

00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:32.270
go off in all directions.

00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:33.770
So you'd like to
have something that

00:16:33.770 --> 00:16:36.770
has both high rate,
high energy, and that

00:16:36.770 --> 00:16:39.800
comes to the next progression,
which is called a synchrotron.

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:41.240
And this is the
design for things

00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:43.940
that we now use, pretty
much all over the world.

00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:46.730
This is the design of
current day accelerators.

00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:49.130
The big point of
this is that rather

00:16:49.130 --> 00:16:51.590
than having a big magnet
sitting in the center,

00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:54.525
you can actually locate those
magnets around the ring.

00:16:54.525 --> 00:16:56.900
Because they only have to
direct the particles path where

00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:57.669
the particles are.

00:16:57.669 --> 00:16:59.960
You don't have to create a
magnetic field in the center

00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:01.280
because nothing's there.

00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:03.890
So the idea was that if
you can put the magnets

00:17:03.890 --> 00:17:05.990
around the ring,
you can actually

00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:08.220
make a ring as big as you want.

00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:10.040
And that's what's
actually happened.

00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:12.890
So in the 1970s,
a ring was built

00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:15.589
at the SLAC accelerating center,
which is outside of Stanford.

00:17:15.589 --> 00:17:16.797
I actually got to work there.

00:17:16.797 --> 00:17:18.440
I was very privileged.

00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:21.170
And that ring had a
circumference of 250 meters.

00:17:21.170 --> 00:17:22.880
That's pretty large.

00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:25.957
This machine, as well as one
at Brookhaven National Lab,

00:17:25.957 --> 00:17:28.040
was the one that actually
discovered the existence

00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:29.240
of the charm quark.

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:33.380
What you'll notice is that
the mass of that charm quark

00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:37.610
is about one billion
electron volts.

00:17:37.610 --> 00:17:40.040
So in order to get
energies that you

00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:42.980
can produce particles
of very high masses,

00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:46.400
you have to get to
a bigger machine.

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:47.819
The next machine is called CSER.

00:17:47.819 --> 00:17:49.610
And that was located
at Cornell University.

00:17:49.610 --> 00:17:51.530
Actually, this is kind
of a-- seems like it's

00:17:51.530 --> 00:17:53.660
a TripTik of my school years.

00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:56.070
But that wasn't the point.

00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:59.210
The point was that this is the
next probably big synchrotron

00:17:59.210 --> 00:18:01.880
that was built. It
has a circumference

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:03.519
of almost a kilometer.

00:18:03.519 --> 00:18:05.810
And you can see that the
particle that it was studying,

00:18:05.810 --> 00:18:11.080
the bottom quark, had an energy
of four billion electron volts.

00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:13.210
And finally, we come
to the Tevatron.

00:18:13.210 --> 00:18:15.550
Now this one has a
circumference of six kilometers,

00:18:15.550 --> 00:18:17.200
almost seven kilometers.

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:19.660
And this is where the
top quark was discovered.

00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:21.880
Now, notice the difference
between the energies.

00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:27.490
In the bottom quark, the energy
is 4 billion electron volts.

00:18:27.490 --> 00:18:32.890
The mass of the top quark is
170 billion electron volts.

00:18:32.890 --> 00:18:35.654
And that's why you need
such a big machine.

00:18:35.654 --> 00:18:36.580
OK.

00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:38.595
So now, I'm going to
talk about the detectors.

00:18:38.595 --> 00:18:39.970
So we've talked
about how you get

00:18:39.970 --> 00:18:44.470
from a very small device, where
actually just the cosmic rays

00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:46.690
background, to what
we are now doing,

00:18:46.690 --> 00:18:48.820
which is looking at
how do we figure out

00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:51.800
what those particles are.

00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:54.880
So the story starts with
a very simple device.

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:58.100
In the top right, you see a
device called an electroscope.

00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:01.010
An electroscope is actually--
you see them in physics labs.

00:19:01.010 --> 00:19:02.480
If you ever take
a course from me,

00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:04.935
where we do electricity and
magnetism, we'll often--

00:19:04.935 --> 00:19:06.560
they don't work with
very well with me.

00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:08.720
But you take a
detector, and it just

00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:10.980
has two gold leaves
in the middle.

00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:14.990
And if you put a charge on
the electrode at the top,

00:19:14.990 --> 00:19:17.390
that charge is distributed
on both gold leaves and they

00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:18.770
separate.

00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:20.870
And so you know that
there's some charge there.

00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:23.420
Well, people when they
first made these things soon

00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:26.630
figured out that if an ionizing
particle goes through that,

00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:31.220
you actually create free
electrons that can move around

00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:32.450
inside the electroscope.

00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:34.760
And those can hit the gold
foil and cause the charge

00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:36.110
to dissipate away.

00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:37.847
And so it provides a pathway.

00:19:37.847 --> 00:19:40.430
So what you can do with such a
thing as an electroscope is you

00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:41.990
can actually take
it to various places

00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:43.906
and look for the amount
of ionizing radiation.

00:19:43.906 --> 00:19:45.620
In fact, you could do
it in your basement

00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:46.940
if you were looking for radon.

00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:48.580
You could just take one of these
things, put it in the basement,

00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:50.996
and eventually you would notice
that the charge dissipates

00:19:50.996 --> 00:19:53.270
away, partly because of the
ionizing radiation that's

00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:54.710
going through it.

00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:57.257
So he said, well,
it's interesting

00:19:57.257 --> 00:19:58.840
that there is this
ionizing radiation.

00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:00.390
Where is it coming from?

00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:01.640
And so there are two--

00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:02.420
well, there are
more possibilities,

00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:03.890
but the two thoughts
that he had is one,

00:20:03.890 --> 00:20:05.600
it's coming from the
ground, something

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:08.870
is radioactive in the ground,
or it's coming from the sky.

00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:11.510
So his idea was to take it
to the bottom of the Eiffel

00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:12.256
Tower--

00:20:12.256 --> 00:20:14.630
and the tallest building at
the time, in the early 1900s,

00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:15.504
was the Eiffel Tower.

00:20:15.504 --> 00:20:18.021
It's about 300 meters or
about 1,000 feet tall--

00:20:18.021 --> 00:20:20.270
and go to the top of it and
see what's the difference.

00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:23.690
If he went higher, the air would
tend to absorb that ionizing

00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:24.620
radiation.

00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:30.470
And so as he went higher, he
should see that the ionization

00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:31.672
rate should go down.

00:20:31.672 --> 00:20:33.380
And in fact, that's
actually what he saw.

00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:35.510
As he was at the bottom
of the Eiffel Tower,

00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:38.360
the ionizing
radiation was higher

00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:40.880
and the rate that the
gold leaves went together

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:42.020
was much quicker.

00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:45.150
When he went to the top, they
dissipated much more slowly.

00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:47.150
And that was actually one
of the first evidences

00:20:47.150 --> 00:20:49.090
that there actually are--

00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:52.004
well, one, that there's actually
radiation from the earth.

00:20:52.004 --> 00:20:53.420
But the interesting
thing about it

00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:57.110
was that when he went higher
up, the rate of ionization

00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:59.390
didn't go down as
quickly as he thought.

00:20:59.390 --> 00:21:01.069
It went down to about a half.

00:21:01.069 --> 00:21:02.360
And if he had gone to the top--

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:03.350
I don't remember
that exact number--

00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:05.266
but it should have gone
down to like a quarter

00:21:05.266 --> 00:21:06.711
or something like that.

00:21:06.711 --> 00:21:08.960
So that was saying-- well,
that was a little puzzling.

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:10.220
Because it said that
not only was there

00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:11.960
something radiating
from the ground,

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:13.334
but there also
might be something

00:21:13.334 --> 00:21:14.870
radiating from the earth.

00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:17.660
The next experiments,
actually, Victor Hess

00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:20.360
took the same type of
electroscope in a balloon.

00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:22.490
And as he got higher
and higher up, in fact

00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:24.350
he found that the rate
of ionizing radiation

00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:26.012
went up, not down.

00:21:26.012 --> 00:21:28.220
And that's because the
Earth's atmosphere protects us

00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:31.820
from a lot of that
ionizing radiation.

00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:32.352
OK.

00:21:32.352 --> 00:21:33.810
So the next thing
I'm going to show

00:21:33.810 --> 00:21:37.140
is what you've probably
seen a lot of times before.

00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:39.960
When we look at particle
interactions, often what we see

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:42.070
is these funny little
tracks appearing.

00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:44.040
And I have a little movie
that's going to play.

00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:45.498
And this is called
a cloud chamber.

00:21:45.498 --> 00:21:49.170
A cloud chamber is
basically a device that's

00:21:49.170 --> 00:21:53.490
filled with a highly ionized--

00:21:53.490 --> 00:21:55.350
superheated liquid.

00:21:55.350 --> 00:21:57.510
And when particles go
through that liquid,

00:21:57.510 --> 00:22:00.840
they actually ionize the gas.

00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:02.650
And it causes little
tracks to appear.

00:22:02.650 --> 00:22:04.450
So you'll see one here.

00:22:04.450 --> 00:22:07.060
We'll wait a couple seconds.

00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:09.640
These bright white tracks--
there's one on the right there.

00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:11.890
Those are actually
cosmic rays that

00:22:11.890 --> 00:22:14.210
are just going through--
they're hitting us right now.

00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:17.020
And they're going
through this detector

00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:18.520
and leaving tracks behind.

00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:20.215
So if you take a
picture of that,

00:22:20.215 --> 00:22:23.690
you'll often see something
that looks like this.

00:22:23.690 --> 00:22:26.320
Now, as a physicist, we
want to use these tracks

00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:27.370
to do something with it.

00:22:27.370 --> 00:22:29.161
We don't just want to
take pretty pictures.

00:22:29.161 --> 00:22:30.282
They are kind of pretty.

00:22:30.282 --> 00:22:31.990
And what we do is we
notice that-- you'll

00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:33.520
see that there are two
particles that seem

00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:34.686
to come from the same place.

00:22:34.686 --> 00:22:36.220
We call that a vertex.

00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:39.010
And I have overlaid
on top of that-- there

00:22:39.010 --> 00:22:42.130
is a vertex going out with
two particles coming out.

00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:44.052
But before it gets there--

00:22:44.052 --> 00:22:45.760
I'll just come back--
notice that there's

00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:47.710
nothing that leads up to it.

00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:50.650
So what that means is that
there's a-- in this case--

00:22:50.650 --> 00:22:53.830
a neutral particle which doesn't
interact with my detector.

00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:57.190
And all I detect is
the two particles

00:22:57.190 --> 00:22:58.360
that come from its decay.

00:22:58.360 --> 00:22:59.920
So a neutral particle came in.

00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:03.400
It decayed and left behind
two other particles.

00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:06.055
The cool thing
about that is that--

00:23:06.055 --> 00:23:08.080
that particle's
called a lambda--

00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:11.110
when the lambda
comes in and decays,

00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:12.910
it leaves behind two
extra particles--

00:23:12.910 --> 00:23:14.560
a proton and a pion.

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:16.480
And that's what we observe.

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:19.730
If you remember from
Keith Dienes' lecture,

00:23:19.730 --> 00:23:22.810
in physics there are some really
cool and important things.

00:23:22.810 --> 00:23:24.640
And those are conservation laws.

00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:26.620
In this case, we
can take advantage

00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:30.280
of conservation of energy
and conservation of momentum.

00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:33.670
And because of that,
these two particles

00:23:33.670 --> 00:23:36.610
together have the net
momentum and energy

00:23:36.610 --> 00:23:38.080
of the original particle.

00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:42.130
So if we can look at the
tracks of what's left behind,

00:23:42.130 --> 00:23:44.350
we can actually figure
out what caused that.

00:23:44.350 --> 00:23:48.460
So we don't actually have
to see the initial particle.

00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:50.749
We can just look at
what's left behind.

00:23:50.749 --> 00:23:53.290
Those are what we often call
the daughter or decay particles.

00:23:53.290 --> 00:23:56.170
And so if we can measure the
tracks of those two remaining

00:23:56.170 --> 00:23:59.140
particles, we can actually
tell what happened before that

00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:01.660
and know, even though
it's an unseen particle,

00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:05.150
that we have a new particle,
which may be the Higgs,

00:24:05.150 --> 00:24:07.350
for instance.

00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:09.720
So what can we do with
those two particles?

00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:11.850
Well, with those two
particles, as they

00:24:11.850 --> 00:24:14.760
go through our detector, they
leave behind these tracks.

00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:17.070
You saw them in
the cloud chamber.

00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:19.500
In this case, the
tracks, if they're put

00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:21.960
inside a magnetic field, curve.

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:24.080
We can measure that
curvature very easily.

00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:26.830
And from that curvature, you
can determine its momentum.

00:24:26.830 --> 00:24:31.950
Later, as you look at the
particles as they swirl around

00:24:31.950 --> 00:24:37.020
and lose energy, the number
of dots in that picture

00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:40.080
changes, or the density
of dots along the track.

00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:41.700
And if we can
measure that density,

00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:44.420
we can then figure out what
the energy of that particle is.

00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:46.740
And with those two things--
the energy of the particle

00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:48.169
and the momentum--

00:24:48.169 --> 00:24:49.710
we can add them
together to determine

00:24:49.710 --> 00:24:52.957
what the energy and momentum
of the original particle was.

00:24:52.957 --> 00:24:54.040
And that's very important.

00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:55.030
We'll come back to
that in a second.

00:24:55.030 --> 00:24:56.970
But I just want to leave
you with that one point,

00:24:56.970 --> 00:24:58.110
that if you can
determine the energy

00:24:58.110 --> 00:25:00.077
and momentum of the
daughter particles,

00:25:00.077 --> 00:25:02.160
you know the energy and
the momentum of the parent

00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:02.940
particle.

00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:05.600
And that's the thing
we're trying to find.

00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:06.200
OK.

00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:09.470
So the types of technology
that people have used

00:25:09.470 --> 00:25:11.060
are these imaging technologies.

00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:12.740
And these are kind of the
things that-- you can tell just

00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:14.948
from the fact that they're
black and white that these

00:25:14.948 --> 00:25:16.490
are kind of older technologies.

00:25:16.490 --> 00:25:17.900
On the left is Carl Anderson.

00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:20.180
He was one of the inventors
of the cloud chamber

00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:21.524
that we saw those pictures of.

00:25:21.524 --> 00:25:22.940
On the right is
another gentleman.

00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:24.380
I forget his name.

00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:26.960
But what he has is just
basically a piece of film.

00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:31.910
And that film, if you just leave
it out on top of a mountaintop,

00:25:31.910 --> 00:25:34.100
eventually you'll sometimes
see particles that

00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:36.082
actually go through and decay.

00:25:36.082 --> 00:25:37.790
And there's an example
of a particle that

00:25:37.790 --> 00:25:40.100
hit and actually
splattered and created

00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:41.510
a whole set of new particles.

00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:43.850
So those were
imaging technologies.

00:25:43.850 --> 00:25:46.160
Those imaging technologies
are great because you

00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:47.317
can see all the tracks.

00:25:47.317 --> 00:25:49.400
You get precise information
of where the track is.

00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:51.026
You can measure to
infinite precision.

00:25:51.026 --> 00:25:52.650
The problem is that
you have to measure

00:25:52.650 --> 00:25:54.080
it to infinite precision.

00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:57.350
Because these poor women
here-- and they were mostly

00:25:57.350 --> 00:25:59.140
women-- were called
human scanners.

00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:01.370
They are actually given
a number of pictures

00:26:01.370 --> 00:26:04.060
and they had to measure
every single dot along that--

00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:06.789
to look through something like
that on the left-hand side

00:26:06.789 --> 00:26:07.955
and determine what happened.

00:26:07.955 --> 00:26:11.660
And as you can see on that,
by the late '60s, the amount

00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:14.880
of data they produced was so
much that three days of data to

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:17.030
took these human scanners
two years to go through

00:26:17.030 --> 00:26:18.232
that data set.

00:26:18.232 --> 00:26:19.190
Well, that's a problem.

00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:20.192
Well, not for me.

00:26:20.192 --> 00:26:21.400
But for these people, anyway.

00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:28.250
So the next exercise was, how
can we replace this imaging

00:26:28.250 --> 00:26:30.630
technology with another
technology which

00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:34.370
can measure where the particles
are, but doesn't require us to,

00:26:34.370 --> 00:26:37.520
as a human, go through and
look for every single hit

00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:38.690
or whatever that is.

00:26:38.690 --> 00:26:41.690
And what I'm showing
you here is an example

00:26:41.690 --> 00:26:43.940
from Ernest
Rutherford's lab, where

00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:46.550
he was the person who
discovered the existence

00:26:46.550 --> 00:26:49.039
of the nucleus of the atom.

00:26:49.039 --> 00:26:50.330
And you can see here his words.

00:26:50.330 --> 00:26:52.070
He said-- what he
did was, he took

00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:54.050
alpha particles-- alpha
particles are really

00:26:54.050 --> 00:26:56.360
just helium atoms
without the electrons.

00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:59.240
They fired them at a
piece of gold foil.

00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:03.410
And miraculously, some
of those alpha particles

00:27:03.410 --> 00:27:05.092
actually bounced backwards.

00:27:05.092 --> 00:27:06.800
And in general, most
of them went forward

00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:08.133
because they missed the nucleus.

00:27:08.133 --> 00:27:10.160
But every so often, they
would hit the nucleus,

00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:12.860
bounce backwards, and you'd
see particles ending up

00:27:12.860 --> 00:27:14.240
in the back.

00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:16.490
And as you can
see, his quote was

00:27:16.490 --> 00:27:19.550
that it was as if you
had fired a Naval ship

00:27:19.550 --> 00:27:22.820
shell, a 15-inch shell at
a piece of tissue paper

00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:24.320
and it came bouncing
back to you.

00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:25.780
I mean, that's how
extraordinary it was.

00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:26.970
Well, it's so
extraordinary that he

00:27:26.970 --> 00:27:28.803
decided he didn't want
to do the experiment.

00:27:28.803 --> 00:27:31.610
He actually assigned it as an
undergraduate research project

00:27:31.610 --> 00:27:33.020
to a student at Manchester.

00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:34.490
And that was his project.

00:27:34.490 --> 00:27:38.030
And the reason it was so tedious
is that to do this experiment,

00:27:38.030 --> 00:27:41.660
they actually had to look
at a fluorescent screen

00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:43.850
and stare at it with a
microscope in a completely

00:27:43.850 --> 00:27:44.870
dark room.

00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:48.500
So it took them 30 minutes
to acclimate their eyes.

00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:51.592
And after they had been looking
at this screen for a minute,

00:27:51.592 --> 00:27:52.550
they had to change out.

00:27:52.550 --> 00:27:54.560
So you can imagine
both the human bias

00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:57.549
that can be introduced and
also the pain on your eyes.

00:27:57.549 --> 00:27:59.840
I don't know how good their
eyes were at the end of it.

00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:02.100
But the point is that
this was an apparatus--

00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:03.710
they discovered this.

00:28:03.710 --> 00:28:06.650
They discovered-- he was
actually-- along with--

00:28:06.650 --> 00:28:08.480
so Ernest Rutherford
is on the right.

00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:11.280
And on the left is Hans Geiger,
a name you'll come to see.

00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:13.760
And they realized this was a
very interesting measurement,

00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:16.470
but this is probably not
the way to measure it.

00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:18.800
So Hans Geiger actually came
up with something that's

00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:21.170
now called the Geiger tube.

00:28:21.170 --> 00:28:23.872
This is a device in which
there's a wire going down

00:28:23.872 --> 00:28:24.830
the middle of the tube.

00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:27.110
And the tube itself
is filled with gas.

00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:30.380
When a particle goes
through, it ionizes the gas

00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:31.730
and releases electrons.

00:28:31.730 --> 00:28:34.694
And those electrons can
travel to the anode,

00:28:34.694 --> 00:28:37.110
the wire in the center, and
creates a little bit of pulse.

00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:39.587
So you can actually measure
this using a machine now,

00:28:39.587 --> 00:28:41.420
as opposed to looking
at it with human eyes.

00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:42.860
And you've probably
heard this if you've ever

00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:44.901
seen old movies where they
have a Geiger counter.

00:28:44.901 --> 00:28:47.740
You turn it on and the
thing starts clicking away.

00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:51.790
So that's kind of the next
evolution in technology.

00:28:51.790 --> 00:28:54.100
Nowadays, we can take
all those technologies

00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:55.100
and put them together.

00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:59.230
So now, when we come
to the 21st century,

00:28:59.230 --> 00:29:02.517
you can put a bunch of Geiger
tubes on top of each other,

00:29:02.517 --> 00:29:03.350
as you can see here.

00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:04.720
They're actually called
proportional tubes.

00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:06.340
They're operated
slightly differently.

00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:07.695
But you can stack them together.

00:29:07.695 --> 00:29:09.070
And when a particle
goes through,

00:29:09.070 --> 00:29:10.780
you can actually
see the particle

00:29:10.780 --> 00:29:11.879
hitting specific tubes.

00:29:11.879 --> 00:29:14.170
And from that, you can measure
where the particle went.

00:29:14.170 --> 00:29:16.150
You can actually
measure the pathway.

00:29:16.150 --> 00:29:18.400
On the left-hand
side, the top left,

00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:22.240
is a silicon chip, which
actually has very, very

00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:24.910
fine gold wires etched on it.

00:29:24.910 --> 00:29:28.150
And those etchings allow us
to actually do the same thing.

00:29:28.150 --> 00:29:30.117
When a particle goes
through that silicon chip,

00:29:30.117 --> 00:29:32.450
we can actually measure where
the particle went through,

00:29:32.450 --> 00:29:34.090
to within a few microns.

00:29:34.090 --> 00:29:34.950
It's amazing.

00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:39.709
And a micron, if you know,
is a millionth of a meter.

00:29:39.709 --> 00:29:41.250
And then finally,
instead of actually

00:29:41.250 --> 00:29:43.950
having to try to look at
the density of bubbles

00:29:43.950 --> 00:29:45.969
along that pathway,
we can use a device

00:29:45.969 --> 00:29:47.010
like the one on the left.

00:29:47.010 --> 00:29:50.070
It's called a calorimeter,
just like the word calorie.

00:29:50.070 --> 00:29:51.480
It just measures energy.

00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:54.210
So we can take this device
here, and by watching

00:29:54.210 --> 00:29:57.857
a particle enter and create
a shower of new particles,

00:29:57.857 --> 00:29:59.315
we can actually
measure the energy.

00:29:59.315 --> 00:30:01.950
So with these
three technologies,

00:30:01.950 --> 00:30:03.690
we can now enter
the digital age.

00:30:03.690 --> 00:30:06.390
And we now have a device which
we can hook up to a computer

00:30:06.390 --> 00:30:07.890
and read the information out.

00:30:07.890 --> 00:30:09.900
We don't have to depend
on those human scanners.

00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:12.980
And that's what we do now.

00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:17.350
So we're now entering
the age of the LHC.

00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:19.450
This is a picture
of the LHC tunnel.

00:30:19.450 --> 00:30:21.310
So Keith Dienes talked about it.

00:30:21.310 --> 00:30:25.030
This is currently the
world's largest synchrotron

00:30:25.030 --> 00:30:26.245
that's ever been built.

00:30:26.245 --> 00:30:28.870
And what you're seeing is you're
looking down the tunnel of it.

00:30:28.870 --> 00:30:30.411
In fact, it looks
like it's straight.

00:30:30.411 --> 00:30:33.310
It's so big that you can barely
see that the tunnel curves

00:30:33.310 --> 00:30:35.320
a little bit to your right.

00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:38.170
Inside the tunnel are these big
blue objects which are magnets.

00:30:38.170 --> 00:30:39.610
And those are the
magnets that are slightly

00:30:39.610 --> 00:30:41.920
steering the particles
as they try to go around

00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:43.810
this very large tunnel.

00:30:43.810 --> 00:30:49.000
And this is actually a
picture with actually an image

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:50.530
superimposed on top of it.

00:30:50.530 --> 00:30:52.540
So they make a little
bit of a cut away.

00:30:52.540 --> 00:30:55.060
And the two tubes that
you see on the center

00:30:55.060 --> 00:30:57.640
are actually two tubes which
are filled with protons.

00:30:57.640 --> 00:30:59.530
So in the LHC, we
have protons going

00:30:59.530 --> 00:31:01.780
one way, which are going
to collide with protons

00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:03.370
going the opposite direction.

00:31:03.370 --> 00:31:05.842
And when they collide in
the center of the detector,

00:31:05.842 --> 00:31:08.050
they can actually produce
some of these new particles

00:31:08.050 --> 00:31:09.700
we're looking at.

00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:11.290
This device was
very interesting.

00:31:11.290 --> 00:31:14.500
Most accelerators up
until this time actually

00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:17.565
used a particle and
its antiparticle.

00:31:17.565 --> 00:31:20.650
If a particle and antiparticle
are in the same magnetic field,

00:31:20.650 --> 00:31:22.601
they'll bend in
opposite directions.

00:31:22.601 --> 00:31:24.100
But if the particle
and antiparticle

00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:27.310
are in the same tube going
in opposite directions,

00:31:27.310 --> 00:31:28.990
they'll bend the same way.

00:31:28.990 --> 00:31:31.450
So most accelerators
up to that time

00:31:31.450 --> 00:31:35.130
used particles and antiparticles
and put them in the same tube.

00:31:35.130 --> 00:31:37.390
Here what we use
is both protons.

00:31:37.390 --> 00:31:39.710
Protons both have
the same charge.

00:31:39.710 --> 00:31:41.500
So you'll see there
are two tubes.

00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:44.470
So these magnets actually have
a very unique configuration

00:31:44.470 --> 00:31:48.190
such that you can bend
protons going this way

00:31:48.190 --> 00:31:49.870
and protons going that way.

00:31:49.870 --> 00:31:52.720
And the way it does it is the
magnetic field on the farthest

00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:55.360
tube, say, is pointed upwards.

00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:59.080
And the magnetic field on the
inner tube is pointed downward.

00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:01.480
So by these very unique
magnets, we actually

00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:03.082
are able to produce the LHC.

00:32:03.082 --> 00:32:04.540
But before we go
there, I just want

00:32:04.540 --> 00:32:07.120
to kind of give you a little
bit of history of where we went.

00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:12.460
Dr. Ruiz mentioned the
fact that in the late '80s

00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:15.520
and the early '90s, there
was this grandiose idea

00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:18.130
to build this thing called the
Superconducting Super Collider,

00:32:18.130 --> 00:32:19.960
the SSC.

00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:23.530
And the work on this, actually
construction began in 1991.

00:32:23.530 --> 00:32:26.212
About that time, the
University of Arizona

00:32:26.212 --> 00:32:27.670
created something
called a decision

00:32:27.670 --> 00:32:30.380
package, which actually built
up the particle physics group.

00:32:30.380 --> 00:32:32.440
And actually the reason
that I'm here today

00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:36.287
is because the state
of Arizona invested

00:32:36.287 --> 00:32:38.870
in the idea of having a particle
physics group here that could

00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:41.090
take advantage of this device.

00:32:41.090 --> 00:32:44.920
Unfortunately, unlike Sam
[INAUDIBLE] said with regard

00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:48.250
to the LIGO experiment,
this experiment started out

00:32:48.250 --> 00:32:49.300
costing--

00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:51.640
it was costed I
think at $2 billion.

00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:53.270
The cost rose to $4 billion.

00:32:53.270 --> 00:32:55.510
And by the time they
canceled it in 1993,

00:32:55.510 --> 00:32:58.040
it had ballooned to $12 billion.

00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:00.280
So that's a number that
I guess got a little bit

00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:02.530
hard to swallow at the time.

00:33:02.530 --> 00:33:04.280
So, what did we do?

00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:06.880
Well, we decided, well,
what else is around?

00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:09.490
So we decided we
would go to Europe.

00:33:09.490 --> 00:33:12.010
And so we have joined
this experiment

00:33:12.010 --> 00:33:15.370
called the Large Hadron
Collider, or the LHC.

00:33:15.370 --> 00:33:17.350
And this is an amazing device.

00:33:17.350 --> 00:33:21.850
It's 27 kilometers
in circumference.

00:33:21.850 --> 00:33:24.231
It's actually on the border
of France and Switzerland.

00:33:24.231 --> 00:33:26.230
It actually crosses the
border-- the yellow line

00:33:26.230 --> 00:33:28.555
is the border-- it actually
crosses it four times.

00:33:28.555 --> 00:33:29.680
There are no interdictions.

00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:31.333
It just keeps going unimpeded.

00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:35.580
Anyway, I'll stop there.

00:33:38.210 --> 00:33:41.827
And it traverses the
whole countryside.

00:33:41.827 --> 00:33:44.035
Our experiment-- there are
actually four experiments.

00:33:44.035 --> 00:33:46.496
There's CMS, ATLAS,
LHCb and ALICE.

00:33:46.496 --> 00:33:49.120
The two ones that were involved
with the discovery of the Higgs

00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:50.820
particle were CMS and ATLAS.

00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:53.320
But since we're on ATLAS
we'll just focus on that one.

00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:55.030
But I did want to kind of
point out some of the really

00:33:55.030 --> 00:33:55.821
interesting things.

00:33:55.821 --> 00:33:57.760
When this tunnel
was built, it was

00:33:57.760 --> 00:34:00.430
the largest civil
construction project

00:34:00.430 --> 00:34:04.420
before the Chunnel was built. So
that's a fairly amazing thing.

00:34:04.420 --> 00:34:07.600
It was so big that when they
were digging access tunnels

00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:09.710
to get down to where
the tunnel had to be,

00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:11.710
they had to actually
freeze the ground around it

00:34:11.710 --> 00:34:14.050
so they wouldn't
disturb the groundwater.

00:34:14.050 --> 00:34:17.500
And then they sunk
concrete around that.

00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:19.870
Once the concrete hardened,
they let the ground thaw

00:34:19.870 --> 00:34:21.219
and they didn't have to
worry about the groundwater.

00:34:21.219 --> 00:34:22.389
But when they were
sinking the tunnels,

00:34:22.389 --> 00:34:23.597
they actually had to do that.

00:34:23.597 --> 00:34:25.690
And in addition,
the tunnel is so big

00:34:25.690 --> 00:34:28.630
that it's actually tilted up
towards the Jura mountains,

00:34:28.630 --> 00:34:32.488
which are towards that way.

00:34:32.488 --> 00:34:35.350
You can-- that way.

00:34:35.350 --> 00:34:36.850
And the reason that
it's done that--

00:34:36.850 --> 00:34:38.649
so it's about 1.4 degrees tilt--

00:34:38.649 --> 00:34:40.690
the reason it's done that
is because it turns out

00:34:40.690 --> 00:34:42.909
that the rock that they
wanted to drill through

00:34:42.909 --> 00:34:45.850
was more conducive to
drilling at that point.

00:34:45.850 --> 00:34:50.469
And what it actually did
was it raised the LHC

00:34:50.469 --> 00:34:51.970
from being a few
meters underground

00:34:51.970 --> 00:34:53.469
to just about 100
meters underground

00:34:53.469 --> 00:34:56.420
all the way through.

00:34:56.420 --> 00:34:58.400
The other thing that's
really cool to me

00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:03.420
is that when it rains, the
tunnel actually gets bigger.

00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:04.730
And that's amazing because--

00:35:04.730 --> 00:35:07.150
they actually had a
different apparatus in there.

00:35:07.150 --> 00:35:09.860
And that apparatus had to
account for the rainfall

00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:13.430
because they could actually
see the energy of the particles

00:35:13.430 --> 00:35:16.910
colliding change when
it rained, and also

00:35:16.910 --> 00:35:18.030
when it was a full moon.

00:35:18.030 --> 00:35:20.870
So both the tidal
affects and the rain

00:35:20.870 --> 00:35:22.557
had an impact just on the size.

00:35:22.557 --> 00:35:23.806
I mean, that's pretty amazing.

00:35:27.027 --> 00:35:28.860
So I said, you have to
have the accelerator.

00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:31.220
The accelerator that
we use is the LHC.

00:35:31.220 --> 00:35:33.150
The detector we use
is the ATLAS detector.

00:35:33.150 --> 00:35:35.680
And I was told I can't walk
outside this white line.

00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:37.950
So I'm going to do it.

00:35:37.950 --> 00:35:42.690
But this is a person
inside the detector.

00:35:42.690 --> 00:35:45.120
This detector is
six stories tall

00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:47.280
and it's the size of
half a football field.

00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:51.210
So it's actually
quite amazingly large.

00:35:51.210 --> 00:35:54.510
And the rate of data
that it has to deal with

00:35:54.510 --> 00:35:56.490
is about a billion
collisions per second.

00:35:56.490 --> 00:35:58.120
Just to give you
some other numbers,

00:35:58.120 --> 00:36:00.330
there are a hundred
million signals

00:36:00.330 --> 00:36:02.347
that come out of this device.

00:36:02.347 --> 00:36:03.430
That's maybe not so large.

00:36:03.430 --> 00:36:06.096
But when you think of where they
have to come to into one place,

00:36:06.096 --> 00:36:06.690
that's a lot.

00:36:06.690 --> 00:36:08.610
And the amount of data that
we actually write to tape--

00:36:08.610 --> 00:36:10.117
so this is actually
going to tape.

00:36:10.117 --> 00:36:12.450
This is not the amount of
data produced by the detector.

00:36:12.450 --> 00:36:15.270
The detector produces more data
and then we look at the data

00:36:15.270 --> 00:36:17.645
as it's coming off the detector
and decide whether or not

00:36:17.645 --> 00:36:19.280
to keep it or not.

00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:20.720
And so we only take--

00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:23.360
I think it was 1
out of 100,000 or 1

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:25.980
out 10,000-- one out of a very
large number of the events

00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:27.188
actually are written to tape.

00:36:27.188 --> 00:36:31.430
Most of them actually end
up on the computer floor.

00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:33.560
And this is what those
pictures have become.

00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:35.030
Remember we had
these cloud chamber

00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:39.890
pictures of ghostly particles
that would kind of appear

00:36:39.890 --> 00:36:41.250
in the detector.

00:36:41.250 --> 00:36:43.530
This picture is a transversed
view of the detector.

00:36:43.530 --> 00:36:46.480
So if you think of the
ATLAS detector as a big can,

00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:49.700
the two protons collide
down the axis of that can.

00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:51.269
And at the very
center of it-- so

00:36:51.269 --> 00:36:53.810
in the center of this picture--
is where the protons collide.

00:36:53.810 --> 00:36:55.810
And then they produce
other particles.

00:36:55.810 --> 00:36:57.200
One of them could be the Higgs.

00:36:57.200 --> 00:37:00.620
This is actually an example
of a Higgs decaying into two

00:37:00.620 --> 00:37:02.410
electrons and two muons.

00:37:02.410 --> 00:37:04.690
The two muons are
indicated by the red.

00:37:04.690 --> 00:37:06.596
And the electrons are
those green towers

00:37:06.596 --> 00:37:07.720
that you kind of see there.

00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:10.680
You can see it maybe a
little bit better here.

00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:12.605
What's interesting
about this picture

00:37:12.605 --> 00:37:15.230
is that there's a lot more going
on than just the Higgs, right?

00:37:15.230 --> 00:37:18.320
The Higgs is happening way over
here on the left-hand side.

00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:20.420
And all the stuff that's
happening in the middle,

00:37:20.420 --> 00:37:21.729
all those other squares--

00:37:21.729 --> 00:37:24.020
I don't know if you can see
them, the colored squares--

00:37:24.020 --> 00:37:26.630
are actually other interactions
from protons that are also

00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:28.130
happening inside the detector.

00:37:28.130 --> 00:37:30.950
So one of the things that we
have to do is look at not only

00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:33.650
the Higgs decay, but all the
other stuff that's produced

00:37:33.650 --> 00:37:36.140
at the same time, and figure
out which of them are Higgs

00:37:36.140 --> 00:37:37.869
particles and which ones aren't.

00:37:37.869 --> 00:37:40.160
And that's what we have to
do as an experimental group.

00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:42.620
And so you can see
this environment

00:37:42.620 --> 00:37:44.780
that our experiment
is embedded in

00:37:44.780 --> 00:37:49.176
is actually a very challenging
environment to work in.

00:37:49.176 --> 00:37:51.550
I do want to say one more
thing about the ATLAS detector.

00:37:51.550 --> 00:37:54.550
So in 1993, they
canceled the SSC.

00:37:54.550 --> 00:37:56.530
Throughout the US
physics community,

00:37:56.530 --> 00:37:58.870
it was actually quite
a shocking time.

00:37:58.870 --> 00:38:01.239
People were kind of worried,
what are we going to do?

00:38:01.239 --> 00:38:02.780
But my colleagues
were smart enough--

00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:06.010
this is John Rutherford and
Mike Shupe they were actually

00:38:06.010 --> 00:38:08.230
at CERN at the time,
testing their detector,

00:38:08.230 --> 00:38:10.360
which was going to
go into the SSC.

00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:12.490
And they walked
across the cafeteria,

00:38:12.490 --> 00:38:16.776
found the spokespeople for the
ATLAS detector, and said, hey,

00:38:16.776 --> 00:38:17.650
we've got a detector.

00:38:17.650 --> 00:38:20.230
Maybe we can put it
into your device--

00:38:20.230 --> 00:38:22.120
or, our device
into your detector.

00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:25.720
And the original design
of the ATLAS detector

00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:28.440
has these two big red globs,
which you can see circled

00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:31.640
on this diagram.

00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:33.760
And what Mike Shupe
and John Rutherford

00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:35.530
did was they said, if
you take our device,

00:38:35.530 --> 00:38:39.130
we can put those devices
well inside the detector.

00:38:39.130 --> 00:38:41.680
And if you do that,
you'll find that--

00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:43.420
and they did tons
of simulations--

00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:45.930
you'll find that the detector
actually performs much better.

00:38:45.930 --> 00:38:48.100
That the amount of
extra junk that's

00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:51.010
produced by having those
detectors outside the detector

00:38:51.010 --> 00:38:52.034
will be going way down.

00:38:52.034 --> 00:38:54.200
They actually showed that
with a lot of simulations.

00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:54.857
And it's true.

00:38:54.857 --> 00:38:56.440
It actually did
reduce the background.

00:38:56.440 --> 00:39:01.870
And that design was accepted
by the ATLAS management

00:39:01.870 --> 00:39:04.300
and was the only US
group to actually

00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:07.960
have a significant impact on the
design of the detector itself.

00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:09.880
And so in some sense,
I owe my career

00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:12.400
to my colleagues, who
were able to demonstrate

00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:15.760
that their choice of
detector and design

00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:18.130
would have a significant
impact on the ATLAS detector.

00:39:18.130 --> 00:39:21.012
And they did that.

00:39:21.012 --> 00:39:21.882
OK.

00:39:21.882 --> 00:39:23.090
And this is that group there.

00:39:23.090 --> 00:39:25.010
It's a relatively
small group of people.

00:39:25.010 --> 00:39:26.510
And this is the detector
that they actually

00:39:26.510 --> 00:39:26.960
ended up building.

00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:29.376
We built it in the basement
of the physics building, which

00:39:29.376 --> 00:39:31.910
is just a few-- a block
or so over from here.

00:39:31.910 --> 00:39:33.320
And they shipped it to Europe.

00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:37.130
And it's been installed
and working great.

00:39:37.130 --> 00:39:37.630
OK.

00:39:37.630 --> 00:39:40.540
So, when we look at
what-- before we turned

00:39:40.540 --> 00:39:44.950
on this the LHC,
this is what-- they

00:39:44.950 --> 00:39:46.701
did an informal poll
at Fermilab and asked

00:39:46.701 --> 00:39:48.075
all the scientists
there, what do

00:39:48.075 --> 00:39:49.330
you think we're going to see?

00:39:49.330 --> 00:39:50.955
Well, you can see
there's no consensus.

00:39:50.955 --> 00:39:53.500
There's kind of a wide
variety of things.

00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:55.480
Obviously, the Higgs
kind of rolls to the top,

00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:57.670
but it wasn't everybody's
preferred direction.

00:39:57.670 --> 00:40:00.520
And if you're a mathematician,
you might try to add these up.

00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:03.370
You'll realize it adds up to
a number bigger than 100%.

00:40:03.370 --> 00:40:05.260
People were allowed
to vote twice.

00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:10.846
And even then, you can see there
was no consensus about what

00:40:10.846 --> 00:40:11.470
they would see.

00:40:11.470 --> 00:40:14.095
And my favorite, supersymmetry,
was way down there on the list.

00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:23.500
Remember that when
you take the daughter

00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:26.410
particles of this particle
like the Higgs and decays,

00:40:26.410 --> 00:40:29.042
you can measure its
momentum and its energy.

00:40:29.042 --> 00:40:31.000
Well, with those two
quantities, it turns out--

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:32.666
and I'll show you how
in a few seconds--

00:40:32.666 --> 00:40:34.720
you can actually
reconstruct the mass

00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:38.207
of the particle that produced
those daughter particles.

00:40:38.207 --> 00:40:39.790
And so what I'm going
to show you here

00:40:39.790 --> 00:40:43.960
is a plot of the mass of every
particle in the ATLAS detector

00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:46.240
that decayed to two photons.

00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:49.360
And we started
taking data in 2010.

00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:51.970
The data taking took
about two years before we

00:40:51.970 --> 00:40:53.560
could say anything definitive.

00:40:53.560 --> 00:40:55.420
And so what you're
going to look for--

00:40:55.420 --> 00:40:58.180
we'll see again-- is that you're
going to look to see whether

00:40:58.180 --> 00:40:59.740
or not, as we're
taking data, you

00:40:59.740 --> 00:41:02.410
can see any sort
of anomaly or bump

00:41:02.410 --> 00:41:05.830
in the distribution of
reconstructed masses

00:41:05.830 --> 00:41:06.910
for this Higgs.

00:41:06.910 --> 00:41:07.910
And this is what-- oops.

00:41:07.910 --> 00:41:08.825
That did not work.

00:41:11.380 --> 00:41:11.880
OK.

00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:12.760
So this is what happened.

00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:14.843
You can see at the very
top, you'll see the dates.

00:41:14.843 --> 00:41:17.220
2011, not too much
going on there.

00:41:17.220 --> 00:41:19.500
There's a red line
to guide your eye.

00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:21.180
2012, we're taking
more and more data.

00:41:21.180 --> 00:41:23.670
And all of a sudden, you start
to see something appearing.

00:41:23.670 --> 00:41:26.400
And right about July
12, the experiment

00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:28.980
decided that we had enough
data to claim that we actually

00:41:28.980 --> 00:41:29.982
saw something.

00:41:29.982 --> 00:41:31.440
And what you can
see here-- there's

00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:34.020
a blue line showing
what you would have seen

00:41:34.020 --> 00:41:36.062
if there was no Higgs particle.

00:41:36.062 --> 00:41:37.770
And on top of that,
you can see the data,

00:41:37.770 --> 00:41:38.880
which is the black dots.

00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:41.070
And you'll see that there's
a little bit of a hump.

00:41:41.070 --> 00:41:44.310
And that is the
evidence for the Higgs.

00:41:44.310 --> 00:41:46.890
And on July 12,
there was a party.

00:41:46.890 --> 00:41:49.230
We always have a party.

00:41:49.230 --> 00:41:52.440
The man all the way on the
left is Francois Englert,

00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:56.340
one of the originators
of this BEH theory.

00:41:56.340 --> 00:41:59.160
The person next to
him is Peter Higgs.

00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:01.560
Unfortunately, Brout
had died already,

00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:02.880
so he didn't get to live this.

00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:05.670
Remember that these guys came
up with the theory in 1960.

00:42:05.670 --> 00:42:10.140
This is now 2012, so
over 50 years ago,

00:42:10.140 --> 00:42:12.060
after their original thing.

00:42:12.060 --> 00:42:14.700
The person on the very right is
the director general of CERN.

00:42:14.700 --> 00:42:18.390
I can't remember who the
guy is in the middle.

00:42:18.390 --> 00:42:19.319
And this was amazing.

00:42:19.319 --> 00:42:20.860
Well, it was amazing
for two reasons.

00:42:20.860 --> 00:42:23.800
One, Higgs and Englert
had never met each other.

00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:25.800
This is the very first
time they met each other,

00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:27.008
when they discover the Higgs.

00:42:27.008 --> 00:42:28.860
That's kind of cool.

00:42:28.860 --> 00:42:30.600
But the other thing
that it did was it

00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:33.000
allowed us to actually
say, yes, after 60 years,

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:34.860
we've had this theory
which everybody thinks

00:42:34.860 --> 00:42:38.114
is the theory of how the
standard model works,

00:42:38.114 --> 00:42:40.030
and now we actually have
proof that it exists.

00:42:40.030 --> 00:42:42.990
It took us over 50 years to
figure out that this was right.

00:42:42.990 --> 00:42:45.930
So even though the theorists
had this idea-- and they were,

00:42:45.930 --> 00:42:47.430
you know, it wasn't
widely accepted,

00:42:47.430 --> 00:42:50.640
but people started to
really believe it was true--

00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:51.750
it still took us 50 years.

00:42:51.750 --> 00:42:53.940
Because we had to have
the right technology,

00:42:53.940 --> 00:42:55.890
we had to have the right
group of physicists,

00:42:55.890 --> 00:42:57.990
and we had to have the right
environment, someone that

00:42:57.990 --> 00:42:59.406
would actually
fund a machine that

00:42:59.406 --> 00:43:04.980
would cost billions of dollars
and yet would produce this.

00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:08.130
So I did want to say one
thing about these bump-hunting

00:43:08.130 --> 00:43:10.980
experiments.

00:43:10.980 --> 00:43:12.839
That's what we
call them, really.

00:43:12.839 --> 00:43:14.880
So remember that you have
daughter particles that

00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:15.420
come out.

00:43:15.420 --> 00:43:18.760
We can measure their
energies and their momentum.

00:43:18.760 --> 00:43:22.140
Well, with this very simple
equation-- it's not that hard--

00:43:22.140 --> 00:43:24.480
you can take the energies,
add them up, square them,

00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:26.370
take the momentum, add
those up, square them,

00:43:26.370 --> 00:43:28.699
and subtract the two, and
the square root of that--

00:43:28.699 --> 00:43:30.490
right, you can put it
into your calculator.

00:43:30.490 --> 00:43:31.250
You don't need a spreadsheet.

00:43:31.250 --> 00:43:33.125
You can actually just
do it on a calculator--

00:43:33.125 --> 00:43:35.580
gives you the mass
of the particle that

00:43:35.580 --> 00:43:38.820
produced those two particles,
and there, produces a bump.

00:43:38.820 --> 00:43:41.509
So if you see that bump, just by
doing a little bit of algebra,

00:43:41.509 --> 00:43:43.800
you can actually prove to
yourself that you've actually

00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:45.008
produced this Higgs particle.

00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:50.770
This is the paper that
actually resulted from that.

00:43:50.770 --> 00:43:52.600
This is the ATLAS paper.

00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:54.330
You'll notice a couple things.

00:43:54.330 --> 00:43:55.342
It says observation.

00:43:55.342 --> 00:43:56.550
That's a very important word.

00:43:56.550 --> 00:43:58.520
It means we actually
saw something.

00:43:58.520 --> 00:44:01.390
If you saw just a search, it
means you didn't see anything.

00:44:01.390 --> 00:44:04.840
So observation in the search
for this Higgs boson--

00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:08.680
it's a long title, but
basically it said we found it.

00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:12.040
And the paper ran to 29 pages.

00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:15.040
And 10 to them were
every single author who

00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:19.000
contributed to the experiment.

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:22.030
There are actually almost
3,000 authors and about,

00:44:22.030 --> 00:44:23.710
almost 180 institutions.

00:44:23.710 --> 00:44:27.190
However, the
University of Arizona

00:44:27.190 --> 00:44:29.320
was seventh in the
list of institutions.

00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:31.510
And we had 11 authors
on that paper.

00:44:38.020 --> 00:44:39.670
So, where are we with this?

00:44:39.670 --> 00:44:42.610
Well, in this chart of
everything that we said--

00:44:42.610 --> 00:44:46.240
maybe nothing, something
unexpected, supersymmetry--

00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:47.740
my favorite--

00:44:47.740 --> 00:44:51.180
extra dimensions, so far we're
left with the Higgs boson.

00:44:51.180 --> 00:44:52.540
Nothing else so far.

00:44:52.540 --> 00:44:55.210
And to some people,
that's actually a problem.

00:44:55.210 --> 00:44:57.550
Supersymmetry really was
one of the high theories

00:44:57.550 --> 00:44:59.140
that people thought
would explain

00:44:59.140 --> 00:45:02.440
the next bit of everything,
including possibly dark matter.

00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:04.960
But we're kind of left
with a bit of a conundrum.

00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:07.640
So where do we go from here?

00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:08.230
Well-- oh.

00:45:08.230 --> 00:45:12.450
Before I do that, I just wanted
to mention that in physics, you

00:45:12.450 --> 00:45:14.200
might not be able to--
yeah, actually, you

00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:15.280
can't read any of these.

00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:18.670
But these are nine of the papers
that I've had over my career.

00:45:18.670 --> 00:45:21.370
And I just wanted to point
them out, because as I said,

00:45:21.370 --> 00:45:23.290
there are some key words
when you read papers.

00:45:23.290 --> 00:45:24.850
When you read the title, the
first thing you'll look for

00:45:24.850 --> 00:45:25.930
is search.

00:45:25.930 --> 00:45:28.030
Search means you
didn't see anything.

00:45:28.030 --> 00:45:31.450
And all the blue
ones were searches.

00:45:31.450 --> 00:45:32.680
We didn't see a thing.

00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:36.920
The white ones were papers where
we actually measured something.

00:45:36.920 --> 00:45:38.860
And that's very typical
in particle physics.

00:45:38.860 --> 00:45:41.285
Actually, most the time,
we measure nothing.

00:45:41.285 --> 00:45:43.660
I would say, probably no more
than 20% of the papers that

00:45:43.660 --> 00:45:46.022
have my name on them--
and it's a lot--

00:45:46.022 --> 00:45:47.230
did we actually see anything.

00:45:47.230 --> 00:45:50.357
All the rest of the time,
we have that word, search.

00:45:50.357 --> 00:45:52.440
Now, you might say, OK,
well, he's just a failure.

00:45:52.440 --> 00:45:55.930
20-- he's only batting 200.

00:45:55.930 --> 00:45:57.340
But actually, that's not true.

00:45:57.340 --> 00:45:59.230
The thing is that when one--

00:45:59.230 --> 00:46:02.030
oops, sorry.

00:46:02.030 --> 00:46:04.040
Hyperactive thumb.

00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:06.310
When one measures
nothing, you actually

00:46:06.310 --> 00:46:07.630
are telling people something.

00:46:07.630 --> 00:46:09.640
One thing you've done
is you've told people,

00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:13.297
oh, we've already explored
this area of physics space

00:46:13.297 --> 00:46:14.380
and we don't see anything.

00:46:14.380 --> 00:46:16.780
That's important because the
next people who come along do

00:46:16.780 --> 00:46:18.580
want to know that you
already looked there.

00:46:18.580 --> 00:46:19.640
If you looked there and
you didn't see anything,

00:46:19.640 --> 00:46:21.130
they shouldn't
have to look there.

00:46:21.130 --> 00:46:22.796
And the other thing
is that you informed

00:46:22.796 --> 00:46:25.489
the physicist-- the theorists--
that their theory's wrong.

00:46:25.489 --> 00:46:26.780
That's actually important, too.

00:46:26.780 --> 00:46:28.700
I mean, not because we can just
kind of rub it in their face,

00:46:28.700 --> 00:46:30.340
but because it's
important that they

00:46:30.340 --> 00:46:32.650
know that that particular
theory they came up with

00:46:32.650 --> 00:46:35.590
was not the one that actually
is the way the world works.

00:46:35.590 --> 00:46:37.960
And so, even though you
might say I'm not batting

00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:41.200
particularly well, we do always
publish even those results

00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:42.610
where we don't see anything.

00:46:42.610 --> 00:46:45.190
And in fact, as you
can see later on,

00:46:45.190 --> 00:46:47.920
the majority of papers
since I've been at the LHC

00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:50.630
have been nothing,
nothing, nothing, nothing.

00:46:50.630 --> 00:46:52.890
No supersymmetry.

00:46:52.890 --> 00:46:54.300
So where do we go from here?

00:46:54.300 --> 00:46:56.690
Well, the data that
we've taken, you

00:46:56.690 --> 00:46:59.590
can see we measure them
in these funny units--

00:46:59.590 --> 00:47:01.340
the amount of data we
measure in this unit

00:47:01.340 --> 00:47:04.947
called an inverse
femtobarn, or fb minus 1.

00:47:04.947 --> 00:47:07.280
All you have to know is that
as that number gets bigger,

00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:08.690
we have more data.

00:47:08.690 --> 00:47:10.430
So the green line
shows the data that we

00:47:10.430 --> 00:47:13.580
took when we first turned
on the experiment in 2011.

00:47:13.580 --> 00:47:16.820
We actually took quite a
bit of data for the time.

00:47:16.820 --> 00:47:20.540
In 2012, that number grew
to 22 of those units.

00:47:20.540 --> 00:47:23.000
And in 2016, which
we've just finished,

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:25.400
we've even gotten
more data than that.

00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:29.180
Well, our plans are to,
by 2023, which is not that

00:47:29.180 --> 00:47:32.390
far away, to have almost
100 times more data than we

00:47:32.390 --> 00:47:33.740
have now.

00:47:33.740 --> 00:47:39.410
And currently, my group and the
other faculty members a U of A

00:47:39.410 --> 00:47:41.780
are working on upgrading
the detector so we

00:47:41.780 --> 00:47:44.810
can take even more data
up to another factor 10,

00:47:44.810 --> 00:47:48.440
or 100 times more data than
we currently have on tape.

00:47:48.440 --> 00:47:50.220
So that's what
we're trying to do.

00:47:50.220 --> 00:47:53.450
And in order to do that, we've
been working on these chambers.

00:47:53.450 --> 00:47:54.960
In fact, we've been
building-- oops.

00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:55.880
Where did it go?

00:47:55.880 --> 00:47:57.200
There it is.

00:47:57.200 --> 00:48:00.170
We've been building
these electronics boards

00:48:00.170 --> 00:48:01.400
to mount on these chambers.

00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:03.900
Because we have to increase the
readout rate of the detector

00:48:03.900 --> 00:48:05.691
in order to keep up
with the amount of data

00:48:05.691 --> 00:48:06.740
that we're taking.

00:48:06.740 --> 00:48:08.900
There are 15,000
boards that we're

00:48:08.900 --> 00:48:10.640
going to mount on the detector.

00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:13.396
So we have to build
and test 15,000 boards

00:48:13.396 --> 00:48:15.020
and then go mount
them on the detector.

00:48:15.020 --> 00:48:16.890
And that's why we have
graduate students.

00:48:16.890 --> 00:48:19.320
No, actually, that's not true.

00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:22.570
That's why we have
undergraduate students.

00:48:22.570 --> 00:48:25.750
And so-- actually,
that's not really a joke.

00:48:25.750 --> 00:48:27.514
We do take our
undergraduates out to CERN.

00:48:27.514 --> 00:48:28.930
So it's actually
one of the perks.

00:48:28.930 --> 00:48:30.280
And while they do have
to replace the boards,

00:48:30.280 --> 00:48:31.863
they also get an
experience of working

00:48:31.863 --> 00:48:34.570
on this detector, which is
kind of a once in a lifetime

00:48:34.570 --> 00:48:37.230
experience.

00:48:37.230 --> 00:48:38.160
So where are we going?

00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:40.410
What I've done now is I've
described this thing called

00:48:40.410 --> 00:48:42.280
the Standard Model.

00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:44.140
The Standard Model
describes everything

00:48:44.140 --> 00:48:45.890
in that yellow,
little pie shape--

00:48:45.890 --> 00:48:48.540
5% of everything we
know about the universe.

00:48:48.540 --> 00:48:50.820
The rest of it, we
know nothing about.

00:48:50.820 --> 00:48:52.680
So what I've been
doing with my group is

00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:55.785
we've been actually looking
in this purple chart,

00:48:55.785 --> 00:48:57.660
Because nobody knows
what to do about-- well,

00:48:57.660 --> 00:48:58.576
that's not quite true.

00:48:58.576 --> 00:49:01.590
But the lighter blue,
69%, dark energy.

00:49:01.590 --> 00:49:03.480
That's a whole
different ball of wax.

00:49:03.480 --> 00:49:06.509
But we can do things on
dark matter at the LHC.

00:49:06.509 --> 00:49:07.800
And so that's what we're doing.

00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:09.690
I'm working with a
bunch of theorists

00:49:09.690 --> 00:49:13.410
who have come up with a theory
of a new kind of dark matter

00:49:13.410 --> 00:49:15.540
called dynamical
dark matter, which

00:49:15.540 --> 00:49:18.120
could be produced at the LHC.

00:49:18.120 --> 00:49:21.600
And so one thing I hope
you'll find through this talk

00:49:21.600 --> 00:49:24.540
is that the reason
that I think physicists

00:49:24.540 --> 00:49:26.940
have been able to advance the
field the way they have is

00:49:26.940 --> 00:49:29.130
because there's a really
unique collaboration

00:49:29.130 --> 00:49:31.920
between the theorists
and the experimentalists.

00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:33.354
You know, the
theorists sometimes

00:49:33.354 --> 00:49:34.270
have the right answer.

00:49:34.270 --> 00:49:36.090
The experimentalists sometimes
fool them and come up

00:49:36.090 --> 00:49:37.210
with something different.

00:49:37.210 --> 00:49:39.960
But that collaboration
between the experimentalists

00:49:39.960 --> 00:49:42.810
and theorists is what
really provides that impetus

00:49:42.810 --> 00:49:44.610
for finding new discoveries.

00:49:44.610 --> 00:49:47.050
And so here at the
University of Arizona,

00:49:47.050 --> 00:49:49.960
we have a group of
theorists, we have

00:49:49.960 --> 00:49:53.790
a group of experimentalists,
and of course, we

00:49:53.790 --> 00:49:55.380
have the apparatus.

00:49:55.380 --> 00:49:57.380
Thank you very much.
