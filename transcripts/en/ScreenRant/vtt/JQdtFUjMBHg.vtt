00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:08.490
Since their first film, Toy Story, Disney
Pixar has been amazing audiences and has continued

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.440
this for over 20 years but entertainment is
only one factor from the Pixar Universe.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.920
The talented filmmakers at Pixar enjoy sneaking
in hidden secrets and inside jokes in each

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.210
one of their films.

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.640
You need to live and breathe Pixar films to
know all ten of these because we are not going

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.020
to be counting easy secrets like the Pizza
Planet Truck or A113 cameos.

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.230

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.870
Here is Screen Rant’s list of ten Secrets
About the Disney Pixar Universe That Will

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:46.400
Blow Your Mind.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.980
The Incredibles in Ratatouille

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.699
The film Ratatouille is laced with Easter
Eggs, so much that we all remember when Dug

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.100
from UP shows himself but what about The Incredibles
Easter egg?

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.479
In one scene Linguini has to find a place
to hide Remy and he looks for the perfect

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:08.450
spot, before deciding in his toque blanche
he has another idea.

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.600
That is to place Remy down his pants, once
he pulls open his pants he reveals his boxers

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.299
with The Incredibles logo plastered all over
them.

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:19.750
How many of you spotted those boxers because
you almost bought the same pair?

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:25.219
Don’t worry, we won’t judge.

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:27.350
Finding Nemo in Toy Story 3

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.380
You’re going to need your pause button for
this one.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.520
When Buzz is making his escape from the Caterpillar
room of the Sunnyside Daycare in Toy Story

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.740
3 he whizzes by on string.

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.330
If you pause the scene just right you can
see paintings in the background on the window.

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:46.009
Two of these paintings are Dory and Nemo from
Finding Nemo, once you know they are there

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:48.260
it is easy to spot the aquatic characters.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.460
Especially with Nemo’s orange-and-white-striped
colorings.

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.369
Luxo Jr. in Wall-E

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:02.320
Planet Earth is covered with so much trash
in 2008’s WALL-E that humans left an adorable

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.939
robot by the name WALL-E there to clean it
up.

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:09.009
He has the habit of collecting items he finds
interesting and sharing his spoils with his

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:10.320
cockroach friend.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:15.120
Once a reconnaissance robot, EVE shows up
he goes from cleaning mode to impressing mode.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.300
In one scene he makes a statue of EVE and
her right arm is made from Luxo, Jr. Pixar’s

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.459
favorite desk lamp.

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.540
Gastows in Cars 2

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.250
It seems that almost every Pixar film has
an Easter Egg with a Cars vehicle in it and

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.489
we will be showing you a hard to find one
of those soon.

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:37.140
But what about the Ratatouille nod in Cars
2?

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.860
The film takes us on a World Grand Prix tour
with stops in England, Japan and Italy.

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.060
One destination the crew travels to is Paris
France and if you don’t blink you might

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.440
see Gastows.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.379
Gastows is the vehicular version of Ratatouille’s
Gusteaus Restaurant, maybe the crew stopped

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:56.650
there for a glass of synthetic oil before
the big race.

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.099
Monsters, Inc. in Finding Nemo

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:06.170
When we visit the dentist office in Finding
Nemo most people spot the Buzz Lightning toy

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.239
on the floor in front of the toy chest.

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:11.750
But that’s not the only toy there, there
is another hidden toy that you can spot if

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.230
you turn this dentist office into an optometrist
office.

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.640
Focus really hard and look in the toy box,
there is Boo’s teddy bear from Monsters,

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:18.640
Inc.

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.849
It’s difficult to make out, but once you
spot it, that’s definitely Boos teddy.

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:26.670
We hope Boo comes back and picks up her teddy
bear.

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:33.489
Luxo Jr. in Toy Story 2

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:35.940
Here is one for you astronomy buffs out there.

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.659
Have you ever sat under the night sky and
try to make out a constellation you were taught

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:43.390
about in science class and wonder how those
stars look like a scorpion?

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:48.120
Well, Pixar gave us an easier constellation
to find, when Buzz flies back down to earth

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.069
in Toy Story 2 look closely at the stars.

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:56.129
There is Luxo Jr. the famous desk lamp of
the Pixar short film in constellation form.

00:03:56.129 --> 00:04:02.800
Let us know if you spot him in the night sky
above your house.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:03.800
Newt in Brave

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:08.980
Pixar loves to give you sneak peeks in their
current films about upcoming films.

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.050
Remember when Boo offered her Nemo doll to
Scully in Monsters, Inc. two years before

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:15.019
Finding Nemo even hit theaters?

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:19.280
In the film Brave, the witch holds a newt
up when concocting a spell to foreshadow the

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.880
upcoming film, Newt that Pixar was working
on.

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.389
Did you miss this Easter egg or what about
the film Newt?

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:28.190
You probably did because this Newt was shelved
and was never made, but all you true Pixar

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:31.400
fans already knew this.

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.610
Right?

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.740
Cars in Toy Story 3

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:41.690
Be prepared for not one but three hidden Cars
references in 2010’s Toy Story 3.

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:45.540
In the previous Toy Story film Andy had a
calendar with A Bug’s Life reference on

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:50.650
it but since he’s grown up now we see the
image is now of Snot Rod from Cars.

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:55.690
Then when we head into the Sunnyside Daycare,
one child can be seen sporting a 95 t-shirt

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:57.350
with a lightning bolt design.

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:01.210
That same lightning bolt and red color can
be seen on a wooden car in the background

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:02.610
of the same location.

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.310
Did you spot any more Cars references we missed?

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:10.620
Luxo Jr. Ball in Up

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:15.150
The small yellow ball with a blue stripe and
red star was first featured in an early Pixar

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.090
short by the name of Luxo, Jr.

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:21.970
Buzz uses it to help fly in the first Toy
Story film and has shown up in a lot of other

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:23.050
Pixar films.

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:27.600
One that people usually miss in in the 2009
film Up because they are paying attention

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.319
to the antagonist of Toy Story 3, Lots-o'-Huggin'
Bear.

00:05:30.319 --> 00:05:34.620
Look to the right and you can see the Luxo
Jr. ball right in front of the little girl.

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:38.530
Whoever is the manufacturer of this ball is
probably a millionaire now.

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:46.260
The 
Incredibles in Finding Nemo

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:51.910
In 2003’s Finding Nemo a boy is seen sitting
near his mother reading a comic book as he

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:53.600
waits to be seen by the dentist.

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:57.330
Nothing looks too peculiar in this scene but
check out that comic book.

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:01.690
It’s a retro design for a golden age, pre-red-suit
Mr. Incredible.

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:06.819
We wonder if Edna Mode had any say in his
outfit, obviously one capped crusader shown

00:06:06.819 --> 00:06:08.880
on the comic wasn’t dressed by Edna because
we all know how she feels capes.

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:16.870
There you have it ten secrets about the Disney
Pixar universe that will blow your mind.

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:25.419
