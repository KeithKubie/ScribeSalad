 # Free videos on iTunes! (and changes at Patreon) 

00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.140
 Hello Internet 

00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:05.660
 From today I will make my videos available for free on iTunes. If you click this link 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:09.690
 you can get them downloaded automatically to your phone or tablet or computer. - and 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.660
 Yes, before thousands of people ask about it in the comments, there is an RSS feed that nerds like you 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:15.870
 insert anywhere. 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.779
 I'd like you to click on the screen to try it, because it's something like that 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:24.999
 I always wanted to make available. Partly because it is easy for you and also because 

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:30.460
 YouTube as the only home for my videos is a bit scary. Certainly lately. 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:35.239
 So, this is a safe place for the videos where I pay to host them so YouTube 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:38.100
 has no control over it. That's pretty important. 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.329
 It is possible for me to offer this for free partly because a number of videos 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.090
 have a sponsor message at the end. 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.929
 I tell you this before the next video because the other important reason I am trying is this 

00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:52.260
 is for your direct support to Patreon. 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.690
 It is these 2 things that allow videos to exist independently of YouTube 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.809
 without me, from the maker's point of view, 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:01.039
 shoots myself in the foot. 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:05.700
 But I am also concerned that some of you, my dearest crowd funders, sponsored videos 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.460
 would not support. If you are such a person, don't worry. Everything is cool - that's exactly 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.070
 the reason I made what you are looking at now: to let you know in advance. 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.600
 And of course, every time I talk about "crowd-funding" I want to be super clear that there are many 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.780
 are people who should not support. And then I look at you, 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:23.740
 students etc. 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.939
 For everything else, crowd funding should feel like offering me coffee via the internet because 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:31.710
 you like the things i make. And I love coffee. It is not an obligation. 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.810
 The crowd funding, however, ensures that I can make videos out of interest 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.820
 and convenience and not just because of the popularity. And it also allows for all kinds of things 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.979
 put out advertisements that I think are intrusive, such as pups I hate and you certainly do. 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.840
 OK, if you still follow, there are some new extras at Patreon - I got it 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.369
 wallpaper package expanded with new VOTE ANIMAL and other wallpapers, there is a thank you page 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:00.700
 on my website and a special extra for spoiler-loving grammar nazis. You know who you are. 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.979
 So that's the most important thing today: crowdfunding + sponsors = CGP Gray videos on iTunes and 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:11.610
 RSS. Click here to try it out and let me know what you think. I am very curious 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:12.590
 how this all works for you. 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.760
 Don't let me know in the comments what you think, they are clearly useless, 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:38.150
 tell me on Reddit - where I can really follow the conversation.
