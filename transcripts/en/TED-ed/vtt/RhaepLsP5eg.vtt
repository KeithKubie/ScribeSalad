00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:09.950
It was the perfect wedding, 
the guests thought.

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.430
The groom was Orpheus,
the greatest of all poets and musicians.

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.471
The bride Eurydice, a wood nymph.

00:00:17.471 --> 00:00:22.540
Anyone could tell the couple 
was truly and deeply in love.

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:27.090
Suddenly, Eurydice stumbled, 
then fell to the ground.

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.622
By the time Orpheus reached her side,
she was dead,

00:00:30.622 --> 00:00:35.631
and the snake that had bitten 
her was slithering away through the grass.

00:00:35.631 --> 00:00:37.531
Following Eurydice’s funeral,

00:00:37.531 --> 00:00:42.861
Orpheus was overcome with a grief 
the human world could not contain,

00:00:42.861 --> 00:00:46.391
and so he decided he would journey 
to the land of the dead,

00:00:46.391 --> 00:00:53.902
a place from which no living creature 
had ever returned, to rescue his beloved.

00:00:53.902 --> 00:00:58.624
When Orpheus reached the gates of the
underworld, he began to strum his lyre.

00:00:58.624 --> 00:01:04.007
The music was so beautiful that Cerberus,
the three-headed dog who guards the dead,

00:01:04.007 --> 00:01:06.883
lay down as Orpheus passed.

00:01:06.883 --> 00:01:11.988
Charon, the ferry captain who charged 
dead souls to cross the River Styx,

00:01:11.988 --> 00:01:17.878
was so moved by the music that he brought 
Orpheus across free of charge.

00:01:17.878 --> 00:01:21.399
When Orpheus entered 
the palace of Hades and Persephone,

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:23.346
the king and queen of the dead,

00:01:23.346 --> 00:01:25.228
he began to sing.

00:01:25.228 --> 00:01:30.097
He sang of his love for Eurydice, 
and said she had been taken away too soon.

00:01:30.097 --> 00:01:33.468
The day would come when she, 
like all living creatures,

00:01:33.468 --> 00:01:36.789
dwelled in the land of the
dead for all eternity,

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:41.759
so couldn’t Hades grant 
her just a few more years on Earth?

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.131
In the moment after Orpheus finished, 
all hell stood still.

00:01:46.131 --> 00:01:48.937
Sisyphus no longer rolled his rock
up the hill.

00:01:48.937 --> 00:01:53.007
Tantalus did not reach for the water 
he would never be allowed to drink.

00:01:53.007 --> 00:01:58.031
Even the Furies, 
the demonic goddesses of vengeance, wept.

00:01:58.031 --> 00:02:03.291
Hades and Persephone granted
Orpheus’s plea, but on one condition.

00:02:03.291 --> 00:02:05.658
As he climbed back out of the underworld,

00:02:05.658 --> 00:02:10.299
he must not turn around to see 
if Eurydice was following behind him.

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:15.580
If he did, she would return
to the land of the dead forever.

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.451
Orpheus began to climb.

00:02:17.451 --> 00:02:18.580
With each step,

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.050
he worried more and more 
about whether Eurydice was behind him.

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.546
He heard nothing—
where were her footsteps?

00:02:26.546 --> 00:02:29.889
Finally, just before he stepped out 
of the underworld

00:02:29.889 --> 00:02:31.901
and into the bright light of day,

00:02:31.901 --> 00:02:34.840
he gave into temptation.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.862
Orpheus tried to return to the underworld,
but was refused entry.

00:02:38.862 --> 00:02:40.991
Separated from Eurydice,

00:02:40.991 --> 00:02:44.650
Orpheus swore never
to love another woman again.

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.343
Instead, he sat in a grove of trees 
and sang songs of lovers.

00:02:49.343 --> 00:02:54.392
There was Ganymede, the beautiful boy 
who Zeus made drink-bearer to the gods.

00:02:54.392 --> 00:02:58.713
There was Myrrah, who loved her father 
and was punished for it,

00:02:58.713 --> 00:03:02.581
and Pygmalion, who sculpted 
his ideal woman out of ivory,

00:03:02.581 --> 00:03:07.072
then prayed to Venus 
until she came to life.

00:03:07.072 --> 00:03:08.732
And there was Venus herself,

00:03:08.732 --> 00:03:12.923
whose beautiful Adonis 
was killed by a wild boar.

00:03:12.923 --> 00:03:15.653
It was as if Orpheus’s own love and loss

00:03:15.653 --> 00:03:21.312
had allowed him to see into 
the hearts of gods and people everywhere.

00:03:21.312 --> 00:03:24.803
For some, however, poetry was not enough.

00:03:24.803 --> 00:03:27.284
A group of wild women called the Maenads

00:03:27.284 --> 00:03:31.872
could not bear the thought that a poet 
who sang so beautifully of love

00:03:31.872 --> 00:03:34.265
would not love them.

00:03:34.265 --> 00:03:38.934
Their jealousy drove them to a frenzy 
and they destroyed poor Orpheus.

00:03:38.934 --> 00:03:42.143
The birds, nature’s singers, 
mourned Orpheus,

00:03:42.143 --> 00:03:46.062
as did the rivers, 
who made music as they babbled.

00:03:46.062 --> 00:03:49.204
The world had lost two great souls.

00:03:49.204 --> 00:03:53.885
Orpheus and Eurydice had loved each other 
so deeply that when they were separated,

00:03:53.885 --> 00:03:58.696
Orpheus had understood 
the pain and joys of lovers everywhere,

00:03:58.696 --> 00:04:02.555
and a new art form, 
the love poem, was born.

00:04:02.555 --> 00:04:08.705
While the world wept, Orpheus found peace,
and his other half, in the underworld.

00:04:08.705 --> 00:04:14.594
There, to this day, he walks with Eurydice
along the banks of the River Styx.

00:04:14.594 --> 00:04:17.084
Sometimes, they stroll side by side;

00:04:17.084 --> 00:04:19.135
sometimes, she is in front;

00:04:19.135 --> 00:04:24.085
and sometimes, he takes the lead, turning 
to look back at her as often as he likes.
