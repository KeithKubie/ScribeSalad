00:00:05.596 --> 00:00:08.356
&gt;&gt;When I think of the funding
situation in the state of Arizona,

00:00:08.556 --> 00:00:09.706
it's kind of like the Titanic.

00:00:10.786 --> 00:00:15.896
We are 49th in the country, and here
as the little Vail School District,

00:00:16.346 --> 00:00:18.696
we are the lowest in
all of Pima County.

00:00:22.546 --> 00:00:27.286
We used to have $60,000 as a school
to spend on instructional aids.

00:00:27.586 --> 00:00:30.476
We have now about 10,000
to spend as a school.

00:00:30.956 --> 00:00:34.476
And so we've had to become
creative on how we spend those funds

00:00:34.616 --> 00:00:36.076
and what we use those funds for.

00:00:38.156 --> 00:00:40.856
&gt;&gt;Nancy: Our district really handles
the budget differently than a lot

00:00:40.856 --> 00:00:43.476
of schools do, so they
are able to stretch this.

00:00:43.776 --> 00:00:46.206
With the minimal things that
we're getting, one of the things

00:00:46.206 --> 00:00:48.366
that we've done is try and
cut down our copy budget.

00:00:48.366 --> 00:00:50.786
Each of us has a blog, a website

00:00:50.786 --> 00:00:53.896
that we post our things,
like our newsletters on.

00:00:54.016 --> 00:00:58.146
&gt;&gt;The blog also helps with
students who lose things a lot,

00:00:58.316 --> 00:01:02.166
because instead of me going
and reprinting the papers,

00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:04.406
I can just tell them, 'Well,
you need to go to the blog.'

00:01:04.436 --> 00:01:06.086
You wanna help him out, Max?

00:01:06.086 --> 00:01:08.326
&gt;&gt;Katie: I go to Home Depot
and I'll buy this big sheet

00:01:08.396 --> 00:01:12.626
of this special board and Home
Depot will cut that for me

00:01:12.826 --> 00:01:15.606
and for $90, I have 600 slate boards.

00:01:15.606 --> 00:01:17.776
And so instead of having
to use a piece

00:01:17.776 --> 00:01:19.946
of paper every time a
teacher asks a student

00:01:19.946 --> 00:01:22.026
to write something, we
use our slate boards.

00:01:22.536 --> 00:01:24.876
&gt;&gt;Student: 024 secure 8 is composite.

00:01:24.996 --> 00:01:26.346
&gt;&gt;Teacher: At the end
of the number, right?

00:01:26.346 --> 00:01:29.976
So erase your white boards for
divisibility rule for two--

00:01:30.046 --> 00:01:32.046
&gt;&gt;Matthew: They're great, because
you get away from raising your hand,

00:01:32.046 --> 00:01:33.436
giving a thumbs up, thumbs down.

00:01:33.436 --> 00:01:37.056
You get a quick response and you get
instant feedback from your students.

00:01:37.286 --> 00:01:39.216
&gt;&gt;Teacher: They're going to
do it themselves then hold

00:01:39.216 --> 00:01:40.806
onto it the whole year, right?

00:01:41.196 --> 00:01:42.526
[Nancy:] That's what I want to do.

00:01:42.526 --> 00:01:45.346
&gt;&gt;Katie: We put worksheets or
different activities inside

00:01:45.396 --> 00:01:49.046
of a pocket sheet protector
and students will write

00:01:49.046 --> 00:01:51.556
with a dry erase marker
on that pocket sheet.

00:01:51.756 --> 00:01:55.526
We erase it when the next
group comes and use it again.

00:01:55.526 --> 00:01:59.396
&gt;&gt;Crystal: At my reading
stations, I copy all the paper

00:01:59.506 --> 00:02:02.966
that children are not supposed
to write on in colored paper,

00:02:03.046 --> 00:02:05.326
so that they know that
this is something

00:02:05.326 --> 00:02:06.916
that they're not gonna
go put their name on.

00:02:06.916 --> 00:02:08.416
They're not gonna go mark up.

00:02:08.916 --> 00:02:11.196
This is something that
I'll keep year after year.

00:02:11.296 --> 00:02:14.456
&gt;&gt;Katie: We created what
we call Beyond Textbooks,

00:02:14.456 --> 00:02:16.826
and it's an internet application

00:02:16.946 --> 00:02:19.966
where teachers can take
those wonderful ideas

00:02:19.966 --> 00:02:22.126
and they can post it on a Wiki page.

00:02:22.396 --> 00:02:26.086
Our last textbook order at
Mesquite was probably six years ago.

00:02:26.466 --> 00:02:32.636
So we've got the ship,
funding-wise, that's going down,

00:02:33.016 --> 00:02:35.486
but miraculously, our
achievement's not.

00:02:35.486 --> 00:02:37.716
Our achievement is the highest
in the state of Arizona.
