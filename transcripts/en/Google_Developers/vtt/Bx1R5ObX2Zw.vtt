00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.950
FEMALE SPEAKER: Out there
would to ask questions.

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:09.890
MALE SPEAKER: Shanghai
GDG is a very

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:11.980
interesting developer community.

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:12.820
FEMALE SPEAKER: I'm
glad somebody

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:13.960
has asked this question.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.912
MALE SPEAKER: This is where
the magic happens.

00:00:15.912 --> 00:00:16.870
FEMALE SPEAKER: This is
primarily a question and

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:18.390
answer show, so if any
of you out there

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:19.640
would like to ask questions.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:26.450
JENNY MURPHY: Hi, everyone.

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:31.210
Welcome to a special edition
of Google+ Developers Live,

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.690
part of the Google Developers
Live program.

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.110
We have a special show
for you today.

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:37.200
A special treat.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.460
We have a new participant.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:45.110
We have OSCAR, the Hangout
Robot, a brainchild of Gus.

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.290
GUS CLASS: So I'm Gus, and I'm
a developer advocate on the

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:49.520
Google+ team.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.080
And, yeah, I'm really excited
to be here for Google

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.270
Developers Live.

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:58.420
And OSCAR is just a robot that
I dug out of my parents'

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.270
basement because I remembered
that I had it around right

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.410
when I was learning how to
create Hangout apps.

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:08.750
And so in an afternoon, I put
together a web server and then

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.945
connected it to the
Hangout app.

00:01:10.945 --> 00:01:15.110
And so hopefully when you click
the commands within the

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.872
Hangout app, it will
move OSCAR.

00:01:18.872 --> 00:01:19.310
JENNY MURPHY: Cool.

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:20.320
You see OSCAR moving.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.230
And let's take a look
at how that happens.

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:24.740
We have some people joining
us through the magic of

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.940
cyberspace on the Hangout.

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.110
So why don't we introduce the
people who are joining us that

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.960
way, who will be helping
us control the robot?

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.480
So, starting with you, Emily.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.812
EMILY: Hi.

00:01:36.812 --> 00:01:38.490
I'm a software engineer.

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.796
I do web and [? concurrent ?]
and stuff.

00:01:42.796 --> 00:01:44.940
JENNY MURPHY: Yes, and you had
some really great questions

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.310
last week so you get to
join us this week--

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.420
GUS CLASS: It's a joy.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.580
A bonus.

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:48.930
JENNY MURPHY: Or earlier
this week.

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.230
And next to you is,
of course, Gerwin.

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:55.495
GERWIN: Hi, I am Gerwin,
developer from Austria and I

00:01:55.495 --> 00:01:56.016
love Hangouts.

00:01:56.016 --> 00:01:56.750
I love robots.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.640
So that's just perfect.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:59.970
JENNY MURPHY: Great.

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.510
So switch over to OSCAR's view--
what OSCAR's seeing.

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:05.610
Oh we can see Devin there.

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:05.980
DEVIN: Yep.

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:06.640
JENNY MURPHY: Hi, Devin.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.110
He's our volunteer robot handler
who is helping us in

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.620
case OSCAR finds a way
to get out of frame,

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.210
like off the table.

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:18.330
Anyway, Gus, why don't you tell
us a little bit about

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.040
that interface the people
use to control OSCAR.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.590
GUS CLASS: Sure.

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.490
So on OSCAR is just a--

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.030
there's a tablet that's
running a web server.

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.310
And then that web server has
some hooks that perform serial

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.390
communication to the robot.

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.850
And then in the Hangout app is
just an iframe that is the

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.920
target of four buttons--

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.290
one forward, left,
back, and right.

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.260
And clicking those buttons will
actually open the target

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.690
URL inside of that iframe.

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:55.040
And then the web server returns
a sensor record for

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.830
the bumpers, and the
wheel drop sensors,

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.040
and the cliff sensors.

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.740
And I'm not entirely sure
they're all working correctly

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:04.370
right now because of a
melting accident that

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.530
occurred with OSCAR.

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.640
JENNY MURPHY: Yeah.

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.410
Legend has it that OSCAR had a
short career as a battle robot

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.710
that was not very successful,
as you can see from the

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:16.140
missing panels and
scorch marks.

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.560
GUS CLASS: Well, the other
robot was a lot bigger.

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:18.400
JENNY MURPHY: The other
one was bigger?

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.880
Yeah.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:19.710
You should have seen him.

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:22.540
GUS CLASS: Yeah, you should
have seen the other robot.

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.540
So it's probably a great time
for us to play around with it.

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.110
You can see OSCAR move across
the table a little bit and

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:29.360
explore the studio.

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.980
JENNY MURPHY: Cool.

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:38.060
GUS CLASS: And there's Lewis,
who is our extremely helpful

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.166
engineer for video.

00:03:40.166 --> 00:03:42.290
JENNY MURPHY: This is actually
your first chance to see the

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.200
studio in its entirety.

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.760
GUS CLASS: In its entirety.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:51.420
Lots of cameras and
some box lights.

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.960
JENNY MURPHY: Cool.

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:58.070
So Gus, what happens when
multiple people try and send

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.450
different commands of the
robot at the same time?

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.570
GUS CLASS: So what happens when
multiple people send them

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:05.260
at the same time, the web server
that runs on top of the

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.780
robot will just queue those
commands up and then execute

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.930
them as they came.

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.690
Something that actually we were
thinking about doing when

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:16.670
creating the initial version
was, instead of

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:18.410
just passing commands--

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.600
because when the commands
come in, they just send

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:27.230
acceleration values or motor
values to the two wheel motors

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:28.790
on the Roomba.

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:32.440
And what we are thinking about
doing instead is just sending

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:33.130
delta values.

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.720
So, for example, if it were
forward, you would send a

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.720
delta value of 100 left wheel,
100 right wheel.

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.130
If we were backward, it would
be negative 100 right wheel,

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:43.820
negative 100 left wheel.

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:46.780
And if it were right or left,
it would be positive on the

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:48.610
right side, negative
on the left side.

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:51.250
But actually, instead, if you're
just sending them delta

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.120
values, then if everyone clicked
at the same time, it

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.836
would just make their change to
the robot's current speeds.

00:04:58.836 --> 00:05:00.460
JENNY MURPHY: Cool.

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:01.870
Sounds like something you
might want to add later.

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:02.720
GUS CLASS: Yes.

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:08.370
Definitely a v2 very,
very early alpha.

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.630
I don't know, what comes
before alpha?

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:11.140
JENNY MURPHY: Prototype?

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.940
GUS CLASS: Prototype.

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:12.370
There we go.

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:12.880
JENNY MURPHY: Garage stage.

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:13.880
GUS CLASS: Garage stage.

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:14.270
Yes.

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:15.275
JENNY MURPHY: Something
like that.

00:05:15.275 --> 00:05:17.620
Which OSCAR is definitely in.

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.790
Very sophisticated piece of
machinery that OSCAR is.

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:22.810
So I saw that OSCAR
in all caps.

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:24.720
Does OSCAR mean anything?

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.550
GUS CLASS: It does and the
acronym is hard for me to

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:28.460
remember sometimes.

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:33.150
But it's Overly Simplified

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.630
Collaboratively Actuated Robot.

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:36.720
JENNY MURPHY: Awesome.

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.730
It's a great name.

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:41.290
GUS CLASS: So can we let OSCAR
go around the studio

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:41.900
a little bit more?

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:42.160
JENNY MURPHY: Sure.

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:43.950
So we'll let OSCAR move around
the studio, and then we'll

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:47.750
take some questions from the
stream and from the Hangout.

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:50.500
So, Devin, if you'd
like assist us?

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:52.750
Devin is going to move the robot
to the floor to reduce

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:57.900
the risk of catastrophic robot
failure due to falling.

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:59.760
So you guys can explore the
studio in the Hangout.

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:03.710
GUS CLASS: It's a little
bit hard to see--

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:04.524
DEVIN: He's stuck again.

00:06:04.524 --> 00:06:07.220
JENNY MURPHY: He's
already stuck?

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:10.030
DEVIN: It seems to
[INAUDIBLE]--

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:12.780
GUS CLASS: Is it the surface
that he's on?

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:14.710
MALE SPEAKER: He's on carpet.

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:15.960
DEVIN: I think it's
the controls--

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:22.700
GUS CLASS: So a technical
detail.

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:26.820
I'm using a tunnel that
actually has been

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:28.260
crashing all morning.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:32.280
But it's a demo, and
we have fun.

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:33.890
JENNY MURPHY: It's one of the
interesting features about

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:37.000
controlling robots from a
Hangout is robots are, by

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.950
their nature, hardware
devices.

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:40.770
And Hangouts run inside
a web browser.

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:42.620
And bridging the communications
between the web

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:45.980
browser and a hardware device
is often an interesting

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:46.950
problem to solve.

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:49.390
And the way we solved it
with OSCAR was by--

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:53.840
GUS CLASS: By using a service
called localtunnel, and then

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:58.160
just kind of using that service
to map a global URL to

00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:59.840
the internal URL
for the robot.

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:01.910
So it's a proxy.

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:03.398
And it's kind of a--

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:08.090
it should be reliable, but it's
really just kind of a

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:10.630
beta service that's
sort of a demo.

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:11.920
JENNY MURPHY: It's always an
interesting challenge.

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:12.230
GUS CLASS: Demo, demo.

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:13.240
We get about--

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:17.510
I think we've been getting about
five minutes at a time

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:20.470
on there, and I'm not exactly
sure why it goes

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:21.530
down when it does.

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:23.940
JENNY MURPHY: Great start for
pieces hobbled together from

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:24.800
your parents' basement.

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:25.260
GUS CLASS: Yes.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:26.420
Absolutely.

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:26.980
JENNY MURPHY: Cool.

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:30.680
Well let's answer some
of your questions.

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:34.230
So does anyone in the Hangout
have a question for Gus about

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:35.800
OSCAR, or for OSCAR, even?

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:42.150
I'll see if there are any
questions on the live stream.

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:57.250
So a lot of people expressing
their desire to meet OSCAR.

00:07:57.250 --> 00:08:00.120
You've met him now.

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:02.340
GUS CLASS: Devin, would you
actually put OSCAR back here?

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:04.602
I want to make sure that's not
the web server that went down.

00:08:04.602 --> 00:08:05.920
It could be.

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:08.520
JENNY MURPHY: We're going to do
some little poking around.

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:11.310
GUS CLASS: Some poking.

00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:13.880
Hi, friend.

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:18.480
JENNY MURPHY: And no questions
from the community yet.

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:20.770
So if you have any questions,
this is a great chance to ask

00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:22.900
us, or OSCAR.

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:23.320
GUS CLASS: OK.

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:26.750
So it is the tunnel,
unfortunately.

00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:28.000
Which is strange.

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:33.200
JENNY MURPHY: So have we
inspired anyone out there?

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:34.970
Gerwin or Emily, do you
have any robotic

00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:39.070
plans for Google+ platform?

00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:40.450
GERWIN: Not yet.

00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:41.130
JENNY MURPHY: Not yet?

00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:44.215
Well, hopefully, get those gears
turning a little bit.

00:08:44.215 --> 00:08:46.770
EMILY: I'd love to
see a Hangout

00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:49.390
plugin for the AR drones.

00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:50.415
GUS CLASS: Oh, yeah.

00:08:50.415 --> 00:08:53.364
EMILY: Because they're
actually pretty--

00:08:53.364 --> 00:08:55.430
oh, what's it called?

00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:58.840
There's a term in cyberbotics
which has to do with things

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:05.490
that have recorded physical
behavior that lets you

00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:06.810
basically--

00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:09.050
instead of going, move all these
rotors in all of these

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:11.860
really complicated ways, you
basically just go, go left,

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:14.832
and it will figure out how
to do that for you.

00:09:14.832 --> 00:09:18.080
So because it has that, you
could actually probably do

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:20.830
something very interesting
there-- by setting up a signal

00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:22.920
bridge between the two.

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:25.560
JENNY MURPHY: AR drones and
other quadropcopters are

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:28.470
definitely something we have
tossed around the ideas.

00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:30.050
We've talked about them
a little bit.

00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:31.460
They are really cool
for that reason.

00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:36.650
The APIs that are available
are pretty easy to use.

00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:38.930
But we decided to start with a
terrestrial robot before we

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:41.744
went with the avian variety.

00:09:41.744 --> 00:09:42.222
GUS CLASS: Yes.

00:09:42.222 --> 00:09:42.540
EMILY: Yeah.

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:44.635
I can imagine it would be--

00:09:44.635 --> 00:09:47.810
if the software were to crash,
it would crash in a very

00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:49.926
particular and spectacular
kind of way.

00:09:49.926 --> 00:09:50.280
JENNY MURPHY: Yeah.

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:52.460
It might take out several
cameras as it goes out.

00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:55.300
It would pretty cool, but--

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:57.030
GUS CLASS: And there's other
interesting problems, too,

00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:59.480
like what happens when the
batteries get low?

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:01.510
It's flying and it's
got some--

00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:03.010
JENNY MURPHY: Slowly lands.

00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:04.720
GUS CLASS: Ideally.

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:08.200
EMILY: I think actually
it does have--

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:09.932
it is actually self-preserving
in that sense that

00:10:09.932 --> 00:10:11.490
it will try to land.

00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:11.960
GUS CLASS: Oh, that's good.

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:12.470
JENNY MURPHY: Cool.

00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:16.190
Well now that we have OSCAR, we
may investigate other modes

00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:17.920
of robot Hangout
transportation.

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:19.200
GUS CLASS: Yep.

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:20.218
JENNY MURPHY: Very cool.

00:10:20.218 --> 00:10:21.532
EMILY: Need more robots.

00:10:21.532 --> 00:10:22.410
GUS CLASS: Yep.

00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:25.340
So, yeah, absolutely, you could
create a Hangout very

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:30.110
easily with any robot that can
be controlled or actuated

00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:31.800
through a web server.

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:34.310
And you could actually probably
even use my app.

00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:38.900
So it's pretty simple and
there's like-- we have some

00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:42.490
documentation online on the
inner workings of what it is

00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:45.690
specifically, and the source is
going to be made available.

00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:46.620
JENNY MURPHY: That's great.

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:49.080
So you mentioned that your
application might be reusable.

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:51.070
Can you explain how other people
might be able to use it

00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:52.320
for their robots?

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:53.040
GUS CLASS: Sure.

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:57.020
So long as you have endpoints
that are currently-- it's just

00:10:57.020 --> 00:11:01.170
forward, left, right, back, you
can just change that URL

00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:04.680
to whatever your
web server is.

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:08.400
And so long as it responds to
those, you can just put

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:11.950
anything that can join a Hangout
on top of that, and

00:11:11.950 --> 00:11:13.610
then you'd be controlling the
robot from a Hangout.

00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:15.000
JENNY MURPHY: Very cool.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.840
So if you want to see the source
code that we're using

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:19.580
to power that, we'll be putting
that into the same

00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:24.130
repository that we put all of
our Google+ Developers Live

00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:26.210
code in, the Office
Hours repository.

00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:27.850
And it will be up there soon.

00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:28.270
GUS CLASS: Yep.

00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:28.540
JENNY MURPHY: Great.

00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:29.980
GUS CLASS: Great.

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:32.070
JENNY MURPHY: So thanks
a lot for coming

00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:35.920
in to show us OSCAR.

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:37.770
Unless anyone has any other
questions, I think we'll

00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:39.300
probably wrap it
up for the day.

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:39.480
GUS CLASS: Yeah.

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:40.670
Thanks everyone for
participating in

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:41.660
the Hangout, too.

00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:43.502
MALE SPEAKER: Do you want to
give OSCAR another run around

00:11:43.502 --> 00:11:43.880
the studio?

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:46.650
GUS CLASS: Unfortunately,
the tunnel went down.

00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:46.950
JENNY MURPHY: Yes.

00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:48.420
The tunnel went down.

00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:50.310
Oh, we actually have some
comments from the stream.

00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:51.050
GUS CLASS: Yes.

00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:52.650
JENNY MURPHY: Could
you show OSCAR?

00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:55.620
So we'd like to get a little
better closeup of OSCAR.

00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:56.510
GUS CLASS: Sure.

00:11:56.510 --> 00:11:58.370
JENNY MURPHY: Let's
see if we can--

00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:06.050
GUS CLASS: And if it would help
for me to raise the robot

00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:09.080
a little bit.

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:09.390
JENNY MURPHY: There.

00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:13.360
You can get a really
good view of OSCAR.

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:16.570
As I mentioned before, a very
sophisticated piece of

00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:18.320
mechatronics machinery.

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:21.070
Possibly the most advanced
Hangout robot in the world.

00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:21.496
Maybe.

00:12:21.496 --> 00:12:24.280
GUS CLASS: Yes.

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:26.070
And there's the back.

00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:28.780
JENNY MURPHY: Yes, the duct tape
is coming in version 2.0.

00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:29.060
GUS CLASS: Oh yeah.

00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:29.240
Yeah.

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:31.606
This is actually using binder
clips at this point.

00:12:31.606 --> 00:12:33.390
JENNY MURPHY: Cardboard, paper
clips, and binder clips.

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:33.730
GUS CLASS: Yes.

00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:35.540
JENNY MURPHY: That's pretty
sophisticated.

00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:37.010
GUS CLASS: Very sophisticated.

00:12:37.010 --> 00:12:38.260
JENNY MURPHY: Great.

00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:44.050
Well, with the closeup
of OSCAR--

00:12:44.050 --> 00:12:44.925
GUS CLASS: OSCAR's closeup--

00:12:44.925 --> 00:12:46.680
JENNY MURPHY: I think we're
going to wrap it up for today.

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:49.170
So thanks a lot, everyone,
for tuning in.

00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:52.370
We will have more regularly
scheduled Office Hours.

00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:54.910
We'll be on a regular schedule,
and hopefully we'll

00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:57.410
have some more of these special
editions coming out.

00:12:57.410 --> 00:12:58.690
So thanks a lot for tuning in.

00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:01.010
And if you were waiting on the
stream, thanks a lot for your

00:13:01.010 --> 00:13:03.360
patience as we got started.

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:04.060
Bye, everyone!

00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:04.640
GUS CLASS: Bye, everyone.

00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:05.890
Thanks for watching.
