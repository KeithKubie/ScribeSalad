00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The first real solution to this problem,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
and one that is frequently still used today,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
is called Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
It was first published by Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
in a very famous 1976 paper.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
It was actually discovered a few years earlier than that

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
by Malcolm Williamson, who was working at the

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
British government communication headquarters.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
This is the successor to Bletchley Park.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
It was kept classified, so Williamson didn't get credit for this,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and it wasn't known that it had been discovered earlier there until quite recently.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
And this idea came from a paper that Diffie and Hellman published in 1976.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
I mentioned Shannon's paper as one of the 3 most important papers in cryptography.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
This is one of the other 3.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
The third one--and I'm not trying to put these 3 in order, just chronologically--

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
is the RSA paper that we'll talk about a little later.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
But this paper really introduced the idea of public-key cryptography.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
It didn't provide a solution.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
It provided a solution to part of the problem.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
They started with this introduction about we're on the brink

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
of a revolution in cryptography and posed the question of

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
can we build cryptographic tools that are the equivalent

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
to a written signature?

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
There are lots of other kinds of applications

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
they talked about in the paper as well as the idea of

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
basing crypto systems on known hard problems

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
or believed to be hard problems.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
The one solution that is in the paper that we're going to talk about today

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
is this Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
and it's actually quite a simple protocol.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
It's still very widely used, and it allows 2 parties

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
without any prior agreement to be able to establish a shared secret key.
