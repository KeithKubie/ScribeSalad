this question was submitted by a member

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:01.740
this question was submitted by a member
 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:03.080
this question was submitted by a member
of the Institute for Electrical and

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090
of the Institute for Electrical and
 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:04.579
of the Institute for Electrical and
Electronics Engineers part of the

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589
Electronics Engineers part of the
 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.160
Electronics Engineers part of the
magnetics community the question is can

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170
magnetics community the question is can
 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.430
magnetics community the question is can
spin be used for communication

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:09.440
spin be used for communication
 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.860
spin be used for communication
communication long-distance

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:11.870
communication long-distance
 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.919
communication long-distance
communication you mean the spin cannot

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929
communication you mean the spin cannot
 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.960
communication you mean the spin cannot
be transferred to a viral on this and

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970
be transferred to a viral on this and
 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.460
be transferred to a viral on this and
say unread the microns is a maximum that

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470
say unread the microns is a maximum that
 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.720
say unread the microns is a maximum that
can be first seen today so for

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730
can be first seen today so for
 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.359
can be first seen today so for
communication at a long distance the

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:31.369
communication at a long distance the
 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:35.350
communication at a long distance the
necessarily is electrical current or

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360
necessarily is electrical current or
 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.729
necessarily is electrical current or
waves that is light or hydro waves and

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739
waves that is light or hydro waves and
 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.020
waves that is light or hydro waves and
so what is important is to to to develop

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030
so what is important is to to to develop
 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.110
so what is important is to to to develop
the possible relays for exam between

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120
the possible relays for exam between
 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.500
the possible relays for exam between
spins spin currents and emission of

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510
spins spin currents and emission of
 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:58.430
spins spin currents and emission of
light of emission of microwaves

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440
light of emission of microwaves
 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.389
light of emission of microwaves
this is very important of phila we

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399
this is very important of phila we
 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.800
this is very important of phila we
search today as is pooram of relay

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810
search today as is pooram of relay
 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:11.749
search today as is pooram of relay
between spins and other type of other

00:01:11.749 --> 00:01:11.759
between spins and other type of other
 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:17.260
between spins and other type of other
type of physics more Halloween for

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270
type of physics more Halloween for
 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.110
type of physics more Halloween for
communication at long distance
