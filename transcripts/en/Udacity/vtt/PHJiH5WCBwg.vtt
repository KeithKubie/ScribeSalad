00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.770
For this programming exercise, you need to create a variable

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:06.500
called, year joined bucket. That bin together users depending on

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.740
which year they joined Facebook. So, for example, this would

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:11.750
be one bucket, this would be one bucket, this would be

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:16.420
a bucket, and then these users would be another bucket.

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:18.877
To do this, we just need to use the cut function

00:00:18.877 --> 00:00:21.634
on the variable year joined. I just need to tell

00:00:21.634 --> 00:00:25.128
Cut, on what years I should split my data. So I'm

00:00:25.128 --> 00:00:32.537
going to split at 2004, 2009, 2011, 2012, and 2014.

00:00:32.537 --> 00:00:36.440
Running this code, I can see that I got a new variable inside of my data frame.
