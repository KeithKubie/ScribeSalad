Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello? I'm Jad Abumrad and I'm Robert Krulwich. This is radio lab today our program is lost and found approaching zone without gps. Alright, well you know, I think we're getting real close on the, you're driving into our next adventure is our producer Tim Howard. See if this is it. So I sort and I took a trip. I need your picture id yet to Fort Monmouth, New Jersey. For what? Fort Monmouth. Is that a military base? Yup. We were going to this museum they have on the base to meet this woman Mindy Mindy rose, what's on the museum curator at a US army communications. She agreed to show us around to see what well um, patients. Chad, do you wanna hear some stories? Absolutely. Okay. Here on display we have the war heroes. So she pointed to this one glass case, sorta like a memorial. Well, he was born in 1918, died here at Fort Monmouth in 1937.

Speaker 1:          01:05          So he lived about 20 years, served with the army expeditionary forces. He was wounded and blinded in one eye, carrying a very important message. W what's all this on his, on his face there? Looks like putty. Like what's all this stuff on his nose? It's called crop and it's a natural growth. Um, I think it's a calcium growth and some pigeons just get that. Did she just say pigeons? You've got it. I'm a lot of forget it. There's another one marker for pigeon here. Oh Wow. Wait a second, Tim. What's the story? Why Pigeons? Why Pigeons? Yeah. Well a pigeons are awesome. And B, there's a big question here, which is, well, let me, let me just start you off. Training wheels with a simple little story on, this is GI Joe. He's our hero pigeon, but there's one pigeon named GI Joe GI Joe is pretty cool.

Speaker 1:          02:00          Well he looks like a totally ordinary vision. I wouldn't know that. I'm standing a foot away from a war hero. I think he's cute. He's got yellow legs. Remember I told you about the legs? The feet. All right, so what's the story? Okay, so it's 1943 there was a town, the British have just taken this little Italian town, Cola, Chia, Chia from the Germans. The bad guys. The problem is it took it really fast and their American allies are about to bomb the town 20 minutes. Oh, the radio is there down. They can't get anybody back to the base in time to tell them to call it off. How near bias the space 20 miles away and so they only really have one option. Let me guess. No Way. Just so you really get this. Yeah, bring it home. This bird is in a place that he's never been before. Hallway there for hours. He's been in a dark box. He should be completely confused. Should be, and yet when they take them out and throw them in the air [inaudible] like a cosmic zip court. He's pulled over mountains, lakes, forest, none of which has ever seen before. Right back

Speaker 2:          03:00          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          03:01          did the army base where he lives just in the nick of time, just as Obama bombers are about to take off. He's credited with saving over a thousand British live

Speaker 2:          03:08          American hatched GI Joe Kennedy, the message through an artillery bombardment in Italy and the same units of the 56 London division.

Speaker 1:          03:15          How the hell did he do that? How did he know exactly where to go? Some of them returned with um, the message capsule hanging from their leg and their breastbone shot open and all that kind of stuff. But they would always fly back home. How that's your question? Yep. Hello? Hello there. So I called this guy. This is Charlie won't get, he's a heavy hitter in the vision world. Former director of the Cornell lab of ornithology. My question is, if JIEDDO had never been to that town, how did he know how to get back home? Well, the first thing that GI Joe needs to know is we're wait, wait,

Speaker 3:          03:53          Tim, I'm sorry. Feel bad for saying this because it's your first piece for the show. But I mean, don't we know the answer to this? What's the answer, John? Well, birds have a compass in their head. That's how they migrate. Jed. You dummy,

Speaker 1:          04:08          you're just not getting the degree of difficult. Think about it this way. If I take you on a little boat and put you out in the middle of a large body of water, all you can see is water. And every direction. Which way do you paddle to find New York City? Are you asking me? Yeah. Can I have a compass in this scenario? Sure. But that's not going to help you. Sure will. No, no. What do you mean? No, and just think about it. W which way are you going to paddle first?

Speaker 4:          04:35          Hmm. I

Speaker 1:          04:39          don't know enough to say exactly. It depends a little bit on whether I've dumped you in the Atlantic Ocean, the Pacific Ocean, the Indian Ocean or whatever. You can't swim home if you don't know which direction home is. And you're saying this is what a pigeon does. You can throw it anywhere and it knows. That's my whole point. I W if you were a pigeon, I wouldn't need to tell you anything. Huh? How did GI Joe figure out where he is with relation to home?

Speaker 3:          05:05          That's the great question. That it, okay, I'm with you now and I'm sorry for interrupting you earlier. That's all right.

Speaker 1:          05:12          So how do they do it? Well, and if you have a one sentence answer for it, then that's a short interview. It is a very, very easy answer. We don't know. Wow. But they have been doing a lot of crazy experiments on pigeons over the years, like 60 years now to try and figure all this out. Like what? Um, let us count the ways we have tried flying pigeons with frosted contact lenses. They've put coils on their heads with the pigeons head, like a hat. They've glued little brass weights to their backs. They put radio transmitters on them. Yes, indeed. They've followed pigeons and airplanes. The point is that it is a complex issue and they have definitely not arrived to any consensus for how pigeons do this. They have theories, plenty of theories. For example, you get talions poppy and his

Speaker 4:          05:58          colleagues believed that when you take the pigeons out, uh, to the release point, they sample the odors on the way to the release point. All the smells of the places that they pass, right? Essentially a series of all factory landmarks, you know, you go past the chocolate factory and the olive groves of the garlic plantation or whatever sounds like a beautiful place. And so when a a pigeon is released, uh, what it does is it sniffs the breeze and says, Aha, continue past garlic, take a left at chocolate. This is the odor that came to me on the Northwind and therefore I need to fly south in order to get home. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          06:39          but Charlie's actually put this idea to the test or we anesthetize the pigeons, put them in a box, artificial air so they can't smell anything and are rotating turntable and transported them to a release side about a hundred miles away. And when they got over being kind of carsick they flew home just fine to something else is going on here. Yeah. And here's where we get to my personal favorite theory. All right. Forget about smell. There are some researchers here in the u s who think that the key to pigeon navigation, is he ready for this? Yeah. What is it? Metal

Speaker 4:          07:16          [inaudible],

Speaker 1:          07:17          which is to say if you go all the way down into the center of the earth, there's all this iron down there churning and as it's churning, it's throwing off this magnetism. Yes. Lines of magnetic force up through the earth, out into space. So imagine up there in the atmosphere above the planet, there are all these lines that are wiggling and as GI is flying through the air, he's moving through these lines.

Speaker 4:          07:46          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          07:47          do you think he sees the lines? Well, I can tell you that he might feel them because there are these little particles in his beak magnetite magnetic iron particles. They're twitching in some spots that twitch more in some spots less. And if you can measure various aspects of the magnetic field, like its strength and its angle, you can tell whereabouts you are. Do you think that's what's actually happening? I think it may be partly what's happening. I mean Charlie had, Charlotte says there's probably a lot of things going down and anytime you think you've figured it out, the pigeon goes and messes you up. For example, he told me about this one place, the place in New York, about 90 miles west of here called Jersey Hell fire tower. If we take Cornell pigeons to Jersey Hill and let them go, they go random. Uh, and only about 10% of them ever find their way home.

Speaker 1:          08:43          And so they are essentially lost. It is a Bermuda Triangle for Cornell pigeons. Why would that be? That's sorry I hadn't, if we, I would tell you, is it a magnetic thing? No, no, there's nothing magnetically disturbed about it. Is it a, a sewage treatment capital? No. Hyper active radio frequencies? No, it's a, it's a hill. A surrounded by pine trees. It's just a hill. Does it make you wonder if there's a whole other system going on in a pigeon that we haven't even started to think about? Yes, of course. And then use you say, well what could it possibly be? Yeah. And after a long day of being out there with the pigeons and releasing them and waiting for them to make up their mind and fly home and get the vanishing bearings, you come back and you open the loft and there they are, you know, all sitting on their little purchasers going, cool, cool.

Speaker 1:          09:38          And you just long to grab one by the scruff of the neck and say, how do you do it? But so far, obviously they haven't told us. [inaudible] one more thing I didn't tell you about how they were monogamous. The pigeon mind might be unknowable, but the patient heart is an open book. Yeah. Well Mindy said that with a lot of other birds, stirs and chickens. He'd get them all together. They all go wild and party. One thing leads to another, they love Jacuzzi. Right? Well maybe they go into Jacuzzi after, maybe they, I don't know what they do in the Jacuzzi. I'm not judging, but pigeons, they would mate and they would stay mated until death do they part. So one thing you can do to make the pigeon fly home faster is you take the male out of his cage, you put another male in there with his girl and of course he's going to get pissed off. Feathers are fluffing. And who is the straight male in my cage and all this kind of stuff. Drive him away. He flies back so fast to clean house. Yeah. So this is called the widow hood method. And yes, it is a powerful motivator. Yeah, they missed the misses. So wow. So who knows how he did it, but what may have propelled GI Joe through those darkened war-torn skies was

Speaker 4:          10:48          jealous. Rage. Could have been, could have been.

Speaker 1:          10:52          You go judge or you go get that young buck [inaudible] you go gho and if you have to save a thousand lives in the meantime, okay, just do it.

Speaker 4:          11:09          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          11:10          he good? Pretty good. Those pigeons. But I think we can go one more around for the human being and our natural ability to navigate. I met, uh, a woman named Lira Borucki. She's in the psychology department at Stanford University. She studies languages and she's found that some languages have a curiously, I don't know how to put this a curiously pigeon like [inaudible] no, seriously. They're languages that don't rely heavily on words like left and right. And some languages actually don't have those words at all. Um, in the, uh, culture, I got to spend some time in, they rely on north, south, east, west. Oh, you mean like sort of taking in left at the biscuit factory. I'm going to hang in east more so than that. Uh, you would say things like, there's an ant on your southwest leg, or move your cup to the north northwest a little bit.

Speaker 3:          12:02          Where are we taught? You should back up. This story is too good. You should start at the, where are we in the world right now? This is a community called pump morale on Cape York. In Australia. When was this? Uh, this was a few years ago, I guess 2006 there. The way you say hello in pumper out is you say, which way are you going? Uh, so in English you say, how are you fine in pumped I you say, which way are you going? And the answer must be something like north, northeast in the middle distance. How bout you say, imagine as you're walking around your studio, each person that says hi to you, you have to report your heading direction to them. So you literally can't get past hello in this language without knowing which way you're facing. And you said North northwest in the middle direction isn't really that precise.

Speaker 3:          12:52          It's actually more precise than that. There are 80 some different choices. Yeah, it was socially very awkward. People thought I was quite dim because I wasn't oriented and I didn't know exactly which way was which all the time. It was especially notable when I was surrounded by a small children who unlike me, knew which direction they were facing always. Yup. You can ask a five-year-old there, can you point northeast? And they'll point without hesitation if you ask a Stanford professor or Harvard professor to do the same thing, they have no idea. And I, you know what if you were indoors, like what if you were in a, in a shoulder? Yup. They keep track of directions even when they're indoors. Without windows you'd pay attention. You just have to pay attention. And I think what's really striking about, um, the discovery of language is like this and folks like this as they have an ability that we call dead reckoning.

Speaker 3:          13:50          And it's an ability to, you know, after any kind of circuitous path to turn around and head straight back home. That ability we thought was beyond human capacity. We had observed it in ants and we had observed it in birds, but there was always some other explanation. Like birds have magnets in their beaks and ants are counting steps and you know, there's some kind of extra thing that they were doing. Now there's 7,000 languages in the world, about a third of the world's languages have this property, not a third of the world's speakers, but a third of the world's languages. And these are not folks that have magnets or special aunts superpowers. They, they're using this the same cognitive system that we're using. They're just using a differently, they're paying attention to something that we normally don't pay attention to. But interestingly, earlier it says there was a moment, a very particular moment when she sort of, she slipped into attention.

Speaker 3:          14:49          Yeah. So I had this interesting experience and I was there. So after about a week of being there, I was, people were constantly pointing, uh, two locations and I was constantly trying to stay oriented. And after about a week, I was walking along, I was kinda trudging through the sand. It was hot. And I was thinking about whether I was wasting my time there or not. I wasn't sure if this study was going to work out and all of a sudden I noticed that in my head there was this extra little, it seemed almost like a win, like an extra window, like in a video game there was like a little console and in that console was a birds eye view of the landscape that I was walking on and I was a little red dot. That was traversing that landscape. No kidding. And you just become a pillow ball allo or whatever they're called them and I thought, wow, that's really cool.

Speaker 3:          15:39          That makes it so much easier if you have that little extra module in all of a sudden is the correct word. Is that you? It happened all of a sudden it, yeah, I just saw it. It was, it was just there and then I kind of shyly shared this with someone. I said, you know, this weird thing happened. I was walking along and I got this, I had this view in my mind and they looked at me kind of strangely and said, well, of course. How else would you do it? That's exactly of course you have a bird's eye view and you keep track of your location from a bird's eye view. Of course you do. I have that all the time. No, you don't. You really don't

Speaker 1:          16:19          proceed to break. And by the way, bad voice right there that's been joining us from time to time. Uh, we should explain that. Is Karen Jacobson

Speaker 5:          16:25          also known as the GPS girl.

Speaker 1:          16:28          She was nice enough to agree to read some things that we could use in our stories. So that's what you been hearing.

Speaker 5:          16:33          Okay. Well shall we start with the scripts that I have in front of me? Okay. Please enter your address.

Speaker 1:          16:39          Well, that's amazing. It sounds like you've actually gone into the machine somehow. Are you someone that gets lost a lot?

Speaker 5:          16:46          No, I have a great sense of direction. Years before I did the voice of gps, I was on vacation with my family in Denmark. We were in this little town, it was winter, it was getting dark, it was raining, and then the street signs were in Danish and we didn't speak Danish. And I am still heralded as the family member who navigated us out of that situation cause it was like around and round there in this little town. But who ever would have imagined that ended up being the person giving people directions in millions of cars all over the world.

Speaker 1:          17:22          Can you do that? Can you do the, can you go into character again? Yeah.

Speaker 5:          17:24          Okay. Yeah. Proceed north, northwest in the middle distance. How about you?

Speaker 1:          17:30          Wow. [inaudible] had a bundle that, oh, I did.

Speaker 3:          17:34          Okay.
