00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.310
Relational databases always have a schema. What is

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:07.210
a schema? In layman's terms a schema is

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:09.480
a blueprint that tells the database how we

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.370
plan to store our data. More specifically, a schema

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:16.270
basically says that for a given table, every

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.330
single row or entry will have the exact same

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.870
number of columns that correspond to the same

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:26.030
values and that each column's value will be formatted

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:30.340
in the same way. So, for example, in this table, I can say that there are

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.830
four columns: district name, capital city, size, and

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:38.440
population. District name and capital city might always be

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.370
strings, where size might be a float, and

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.210
population might be an int. This list of columns

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.000
and their requirements on how their values are

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.120
formatted define the schema for this table. Now let's

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.329
add some entries to the table. Let's say

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:56.769
the first [UNKNOWN] I wish to enter is corresponds

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:01.585
to the district Gujarat which has 60,439,692 people,

00:01:01.585 --> 00:01:05.627
has an area of 196,024 square kilometers and has

00:01:05.627 --> 00:01:09.270
a capital city of Gandhinagar. All of these

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.040
entries fit the schema, so inserting this row into

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.100
the table is fine. Now, let's say I

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.620
had another I wish to add, the Maharashtra district,

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.530
which has a capital city of Mumbai, and I provide no

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.890
other values. This would also be allowed, but for all columns for

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.760
which I don't specify values, the value would either be set

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.450
to null or default values that are stored in the table definition.
