Hi.

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:09.360
I'm Grzegorz, and I'm
the CEO at NapoleonCat,

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.990
which is a social media
marketing dashboard.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.070
I would like to
give you a few tips

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.000
on how to measure
the effectiveness

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.570
of your social media channels,
and social media marketing

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:29.440
activities, and how you can try
to make more sense out of it.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.130
Of course, social media
presence is a must

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:37.570
for all the companies,
especially all sorts

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.240
of online businesses.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.280
But oftentimes, people
wonder whether it's worth

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.620
investing more in this
platform, or that platform,

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:53.500
or whether my activities
actually bring any benefit

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.220
to our business.

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:06.950
The way we approach it is that
we try to tag and measure every

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.000
piece of content that we publish
on our social media platforms

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.890
like Facebook fan page, or a
Google+ profile, or LinkedIn,

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.780
or a Twitter profile.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:24.520
And we track the
effectiveness of this content

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.780
of different
platforms by measuring

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:36.040
how this converts into
registrations in our service

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.650
and in actual sales.

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:44.840
The way we do it we basically
use the Google's UTM tagging,

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:50.150
and we tag each
link that we publish

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.700
on those different
social media platforms

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.150
so that later, we can see
where the traffic comes from

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.480
and how it converts into
registrations and sales.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.480
And thanks to that,
we can not only

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:12.550
say that this platform
brings us higher traffic,

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:18.230
but we can also identify those
platforms and those pieces

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:24.160
of content that convert best
to actual sales, which are

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.310
subscriptions to our product.

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.190
It actually works
so well that we

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.300
have decided to implement
this feature in our product.

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.200
When building your social
media marketing tactics,

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:48.140
you don't have to rely only on
your experience and your data.

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:54.990
You can also try to look at your
competitors or the benchmarks

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:59.520
that you think are
best for your business.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.620
And based on the
information collected

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:10.890
from their activities, you
can optimize your social media

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.600
tactics.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:18.550
For example, you can monitor
using different tools.

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.880
You can monitor
the effectiveness

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.930
and the engagement
with the content

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:30.620
they publish on the different
social media platform,

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:40.120
and track the most
effective pieces of content,

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.490
the ones that get the highest
engagement-- what type

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:49.210
of for content this is,
for example, whether this

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:56.200
is video, or pictures, or
links to external websites.

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:01.430
You can also measure
which days of the weeks

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:07.580
are most effective for building
an engagement with the content,

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:14.500
even what parts of the day are
most effective for publishing

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:15.430
content.

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.860
And based on that
information gathered

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:24.260
from many competitive
profiles, you

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:28.930
can build and adjust your
social media tactics,

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:34.700
in order to build the
most effective tactics

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.250
for your own brand.
