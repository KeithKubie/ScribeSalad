00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.050
Just now it’s too thin.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:21.080
Just now.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.870
You know, tomorrow it’s going to be thick
again.

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:27.110
It has to do with the climate also in the
Museum

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:37.920
because if the water disappears every night,
it can be one or two buckets the next day.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.320
What do you think?

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.800
Yeah, we’ve got it.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.720
And then we can let it stay for awhile.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.200
Let it rest for ten minutes and see what’s
happened.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.200
And then we can stir it up again with high
speeds like vrrrrrooommm…

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.440
The level should be tomorrow up to seven inches.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:16.470
Then we are done.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.630
That’s what we need.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.080
It’s thickening up already.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.240
I’m afraid if we add more mud then on Monday when I come in

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.760
it’s going to be a solid block.

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.680
And you won’t be here to help me!

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.240
And I’ll cry.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.780
See?

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:35.600
Look at this clump!

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:37.840
You see it?

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.160
Should we keep putting water in?

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:45.800
Ja.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.040
I thought this would take four days, but it’s
taken five days.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:17.020
When they asked me when I wanted to go home,
I said I can go home Friday

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:25.142
but I was lucky someone told me that no, you have
to go Saturday because you have to be at the

00:02:25.142 --> 00:02:26.969
airport so early

00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:31.200
so you wouldn’t be able to work on anything
on Friday.
