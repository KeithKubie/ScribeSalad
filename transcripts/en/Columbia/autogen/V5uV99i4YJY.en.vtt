just isn't there yet and we're often

00:30:54.489 --> 00:30:54.499
just isn't there yet and we're often
 

00:30:54.499 --> 00:30:56.859
just isn't there yet and we're often
told that we need to study it more we

00:30:56.859 --> 00:30:56.869
told that we need to study it more we
 

00:30:56.869 --> 00:30:59.079
told that we need to study it more we
need to research it more and part of

what I want to talk about tonight is
that we do have a lot of what we need

00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:03.950
that we do have a lot of what we need
 

00:31:03.950 --> 00:31:06.789

barriers in the united states that i
 

00:31:08.839 --> 00:31:11.680
barriers in the united states that i
think are really important to not only

00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:11.690
think are really important to not only
 

00:31:11.690 --> 00:31:14.799
think are really important to not only
be aware of but also to start really

yet we have more and more pollution more

00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:32.930
yet we have more and more pollution more
 

00:32:32.930 --> 00:32:37.030

kinds of you know co2 emissions so why

00:32:41.290 --> 00:32:41.300
kinds of you know co2 emissions so why
 

00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:43.390
kinds of you know co2 emissions so why
is that and something that I talk about

00:32:43.390 --> 00:32:43.400
is that and something that I talk about
 

00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:45.700
is that and something that I talk about
a lot in my new book is that it's it's

00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:45.710
a lot in my new book is that it's it's
 

00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:48.310
a lot in my new book is that it's it's

mean recycling and there's the reduce in
 

00:34:05.310 --> 00:34:07.220

00:43:52.660 --> 00:43:52.670
community center of BOE bomb and the
 

00:43:52.670 --> 00:43:54.670
community center of BOE bomb and the
city wouldn't recognize that and they

00:43:54.670 --> 00:43:54.680
city wouldn't recognize that and they
 

00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:57.099
city wouldn't recognize that and they
built a square you know not that far

00:43:57.099 --> 00:43:57.109
built a square you know not that far
 

00:43:57.109 --> 00:43:59.170
built a square you know not that far
away like you know four hundred yards

00:43:59.170 --> 00:43:59.180
away like you know four hundred yards
 

00:43:59.180 --> 00:44:02.559
away like you know four hundred yards
away but but it was totally awkwardly

00:44:02.559 --> 00:44:02.569
away but but it was totally awkwardly
 

00:44:02.569 --> 00:44:05.500
away but but it was totally awkwardly
oriented and not in you know where

00:44:05.500 --> 00:44:05.510
oriented and not in you know where
 

00:44:05.510 --> 00:44:07.569

people would use it so they fought
 

00:44:07.579 --> 00:44:10.690
people would use it so they fought
really hard and they finally got the

00:44:10.690 --> 00:44:10.700
really hard and they finally got the
 

00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:12.970
really hard and they finally got the
city to let them you know who's owned

00:44:12.970 --> 00:44:12.980
city to let them you know who's owned
 

00:44:12.980 --> 00:44:16.000

one of the students said why can't we

00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:18.770
one of the students said why can't we
 

00:45:18.770 --> 00:45:21.750
one of the students said why can't we
make the university run on wind power

00:45:21.750 --> 00:45:21.760
make the university run on wind power
 

00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:24.250
make the university run on wind power
because there's good wind in that part

00:45:24.250 --> 00:45:24.260
because there's good wind in that part
 

00:45:24.260 --> 00:45:26.560
because there's good wind in that part
of Minnesota and who said the technology

00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:26.570
of Minnesota and who said the technology
 

00:45:26.570 --> 00:45:30.220
of Minnesota and who said the technology
isn't there and I was like really and he

00:45:30.220 --> 00:45:30.230
isn't there and I was like really and he
 

00:45:30.230 --> 00:45:32.590
isn't there and I was like really and he
was yeah and I said what what technology

00:45:32.590 --> 00:45:32.600
was yeah and I said what what technology
 

00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:35.740
was yeah and I said what what technology
isn't there and he said well the

00:45:35.740 --> 00:45:35.750
isn't there and he said well the
 

00:45:35.750 --> 00:45:37.510
isn't there and he said well the
technology isn't there it's just the

00:45:37.510 --> 00:45:37.520
technology isn't there it's just the
 

00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:40.000
technology isn't there it's just the
zoning I was like okay what's the zoning

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:40.010
zoning I was like okay what's the zoning
 

00:45:40.010 --> 00:45:43.330
zoning I was like okay what's the zoning
problem he was like it's not that it's

00:45:43.330 --> 00:45:43.340
problem he was like it's not that it's
 

00:45:43.340 --> 00:45:45.100
problem he was like it's not that it's
just that we you know whatever so it

00:45:45.100 --> 00:45:45.110
just that we you know whatever so it
 

00:45:45.110 --> 00:45:47.470
just that we you know whatever so it
went on like that and finally it got

00:45:47.470 --> 00:45:47.480
went on like that and finally it got
 

00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:49.720
went on like that and finally it got
down to you know it was really just a

00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:49.730
down to you know it was really just a
 

00:45:49.730 --> 00:45:53.800

that he didn't want to deal with you
 

00:45:55.670 --> 00:45:58.840
that he didn't want to deal with you
know so it's like if we can start

00:45:58.840 --> 00:45:58.850
know so it's like if we can start
 

00:45:58.850 --> 00:46:01.150
know so it's like if we can start
getting in there it's tedious it's

00:46:01.150 --> 00:46:01.160
getting in there it's tedious it's
 

00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:04.630
getting in there it's tedious it's
boring but you know the technology the

00:46:04.630 --> 00:46:04.640
boring but you know the technology the
 

00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:10.270
boring but you know the technology the
technology is there so all right okay so

00:46:10.270 --> 00:46:10.280
technology is there so all right okay so
 

00:46:10.280 --> 00:46:12.850
technology is there so all right okay so
this is um there's several clusters of

00:46:12.850 --> 00:46:12.860
this is um there's several clusters of
 

00:46:12.860 --> 00:46:16.090
this is um there's several clusters of
houses in BO bomb like I said they're

00:46:16.090 --> 00:46:16.100
houses in BO bomb like I said they're
 

00:46:16.100 --> 00:46:18.910
houses in BO bomb like I said they're
off they're all multifamily this one is

00:46:18.910 --> 00:46:18.920
off they're all multifamily this one is
 

00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:23.470
off they're all multifamily this one is
called the solar settlement and it's

00:46:23.470 --> 00:46:23.480
called the solar settlement and it's
 

00:46:23.480 --> 00:46:25.210

way that these are designed is they use

00:46:33.610 --> 00:46:33.620
way that these are designed is they use
 

00:46:33.620 --> 00:46:36.340
way that these are designed is they use
passive house technology which many of

00:46:36.340 --> 00:46:36.350
passive house technology which many of
 

00:46:36.350 --> 00:46:41.740
passive house technology which many of
you probably know and they are what

00:46:41.740 --> 00:46:41.750
you probably know and they are what
 

00:46:41.750 --> 00:46:44.680
you probably know and they are what
these calls the plus energy houses so

00:46:44.680 --> 00:46:44.690
these calls the plus energy houses so
 

00:46:44.690 --> 00:46:47.050
these calls the plus energy houses so
they produce more energy than they use

00:46:47.050 --> 00:46:47.060
they produce more energy than they use
 

00:46:47.060 --> 00:46:50.260
they produce more energy than they use
and the way that they do that is it's

00:46:50.260 --> 00:46:50.270
and the way that they do that is it's
 

00:46:50.270 --> 00:46:51.940
and the way that they do that is it's
hard to see because it's covered with

00:46:51.940 --> 00:46:51.950
hard to see because it's covered with
 

00:46:51.950 --> 00:46:55.090
hard to see because it's covered with
snow but the entire roof of these

00:46:55.090 --> 00:46:55.100
snow but the entire roof of these
 

00:46:55.100 --> 00:46:58.840
snow but the entire roof of these
structures is made of solar panels so

00:46:58.840 --> 00:46:58.850
structures is made of solar panels so
 

00:46:58.850 --> 00:47:02.950
structures is made of solar panels so
the way that you know you can't always

00:47:02.950 --> 00:47:02.960
the way that you know you can't always
 

00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:04.540
the way that you know you can't always
rely on the Sun and this is something

00:47:04.540 --> 00:47:04.550
rely on the Sun and this is something
 

00:47:04.550 --> 00:47:06.190
rely on the Sun and this is something
else that people always talk about you

00:47:06.190 --> 00:47:06.200
else that people always talk about you
 

00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:08.020
else that people always talk about you
know we can't use solar because there's

00:47:08.020 --> 00:47:08.030
know we can't use solar because there's
 

00:47:08.030 --> 00:47:08.310
know we can't use solar because there's
not

00:47:08.310 --> 00:47:08.320
not
 

00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:09.750
not
the Sun isn't always shining we can't

00:47:09.750 --> 00:47:09.760
the Sun isn't always shining we can't
 

00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:11.970
the Sun isn't always shining we can't
use when when turbines because the wind

00:47:11.970 --> 00:47:11.980
use when when turbines because the wind
 

00:47:11.980 --> 00:47:13.380
use when when turbines because the wind
isn't always blowing of course it's not

00:47:13.380 --> 00:47:13.390
isn't always blowing of course it's not

isn't always blowing of course it's not
so you make a hybrid system and that's

00:47:16.050 --> 00:47:16.060
so you make a hybrid system and that's
 

00:47:16.060 --> 00:47:19.080
so you make a hybrid system and that's
what they've done in info bond solar

00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:19.090
what they've done in info bond solar
 

00:47:19.090 --> 00:47:21.540
what they've done in info bond solar
panels wind and then they use natural

00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:21.550
panels wind and then they use natural
 

00:47:21.550 --> 00:47:25.020
panels wind and then they use natural
gas to create heat and electricity when

00:47:25.020 --> 00:47:25.030
gas to create heat and electricity when
 

00:47:25.030 --> 00:47:27.450
gas to create heat and electricity when
those two aren't working they also use

00:47:27.450 --> 00:47:27.460
those two aren't working they also use
 

00:47:27.460 --> 00:47:30.240
those two aren't working they also use
biomass they use wood waste that they

00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:30.250
biomass they use wood waste that they
 

00:47:30.250 --> 00:47:31.610

there's a lot there in the Black Forest

00:47:31.610 --> 00:47:31.620
there's a lot there in the Black Forest
 

00:47:31.620 --> 00:47:35.060
there's a lot there in the Black Forest
so there's a lot of wood waste from

00:47:35.060 --> 00:47:35.070
so there's a lot of wood waste from
 

00:47:35.070 --> 00:47:38.580
so there's a lot of wood waste from
logging that goes on there and they

00:47:38.580 --> 00:47:38.590
logging that goes on there and they
 

00:47:38.590 --> 00:47:41.190
logging that goes on there and they
insist that it's sustainable logging and

00:47:41.190 --> 00:47:41.200
insist that it's sustainable logging and
 

00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:43.170
insist that it's sustainable logging and
so you know if that brings up a lot of

00:47:43.170 --> 00:47:43.180
so you know if that brings up a lot of
 

00:47:43.180 --> 00:47:45.270
so you know if that brings up a lot of
questions about regulation that are

00:47:45.270 --> 00:47:45.280
questions about regulation that are
 

00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:49.200
questions about regulation that are
really important but but so that's what

00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:49.210
really important but but so that's what
 

00:47:49.210 --> 00:47:52.280
really important but but so that's what
you know they have this mix and

barrier so what the german government

00:49:34.219 --> 00:49:34.229
barrier so what the german government
 

00:49:34.229 --> 00:49:37.339
barrier so what the german government
has done is they've enacted a policy the

00:49:37.339 --> 00:49:37.349
has done is they've enacted a policy the

the rate payers pay 10 cent more per
 

00:49:46.470 --> 00:49:48.620
the rate payers pay 10 cent more per
kilowatt hour that money goes into a

00:49:48.620 --> 00:49:48.630
kilowatt hour that money goes into a
 

00:49:48.630 --> 00:49:51.289
kilowatt hour that money goes into a
pool to pay people who install solar

00:49:51.289 --> 00:49:51.299
pool to pay people who install solar
 

00:49:51.299 --> 00:49:55.190

panels and windmills and the like that

00:49:55.190 --> 00:49:55.200
panels and windmills and the like that
 

00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:58.539
panels and windmills and the like that
goes to a pool of money that pays them

00:49:58.539 --> 00:49:58.549
goes to a pool of money that pays them
 

00:49:58.549 --> 00:50:02.839
goes to a pool of money that pays them
double the rate that they pay for

00:50:02.839 --> 00:50:02.849
double the rate that they pay for
 

00:50:02.849 --> 00:50:04.880
double the rate that they pay for
electricity so if you install solar

00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:04.890
electricity so if you install solar
 

00:50:04.890 --> 00:50:08.569
electricity so if you install solar
panels you can sell your electricity to

00:50:08.569 --> 00:50:08.579
panels you can sell your electricity to
 

00:50:08.579 --> 00:50:12.559
panels you can sell your electricity to
the utility and they have to buy it from

00:50:12.559 --> 00:50:12.569
the utility and they have to buy it from
 

00:50:12.569 --> 00:50:15.349
the utility and they have to buy it from
you at double the rate that you you know

00:50:15.349 --> 00:50:15.359
you at double the rate that you you know
 

00:50:15.359 --> 00:50:17.359
you at double the rate that you you know
double the going rate for electricity

00:50:17.359 --> 00:50:17.369
double the going rate for electricity
 

00:50:17.369 --> 00:50:19.549
double the going rate for electricity
and they have to do that for 20 years

00:50:19.549 --> 00:50:19.559
and they have to do that for 20 years
 

00:50:19.559 --> 00:50:22.930
and they have to do that for 20 years
and that means that you can pay off your

00:50:22.930 --> 00:50:22.940
and that means that you can pay off your
 

00:50:22.940 --> 00:50:25.700
and that means that you can pay off your
investment in seven or eight years so

00:50:25.700 --> 00:50:25.710
investment in seven or eight years so
 

00:50:25.710 --> 00:50:28.160
investment in seven or eight years so
you get about you know 12 or 13 years of

00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:28.170
you get about you know 12 or 13 years of
 

00:50:28.170 --> 00:50:32.180
you get about you know 12 or 13 years of
profit so this has led to one in every

00:50:32.180 --> 00:50:32.190
profit so this has led to one in every
 

00:50:32.190 --> 00:50:35.299
profit so this has led to one in every
hundred houses in Germany installing

ventilation system is like a honeycomb

00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:28.730
ventilation system is like a honeycomb
 

00:51:28.730 --> 00:51:31.550
ventilation system is like a honeycomb
system so much heat is lost out of

00:51:31.550 --> 00:51:31.560
system so much heat is lost out of
 

00:51:31.560 --> 00:51:35.270
system so much heat is lost out of
buildings because in the ventilate in

00:51:35.270 --> 00:51:35.280
buildings because in the ventilate in
 

00:51:35.280 --> 00:51:37.040
buildings because in the ventilate in
the ventilation of the buildings the hot

00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:37.050
the ventilation of the buildings the hot
 

00:51:37.050 --> 00:51:38.810
the ventilation of the buildings the hot
air just goes out and the cold air comes

00:51:38.810 --> 00:51:38.820
air just goes out and the cold air comes
 

00:51:38.820 --> 00:51:41.120
air just goes out and the cold air comes
in and the heat exchanger retains ninety

00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:41.130
in and the heat exchanger retains ninety
 

00:51:41.130 --> 00:51:43.280
in and the heat exchanger retains ninety
percent of the heat so there's all kinds

00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:43.290
percent of the heat so there's all kinds
 

00:51:43.290 --> 00:51:45.530
percent of the heat so there's all kinds
of the sort of technical stuff why this

00:51:45.530 --> 00:51:45.540
of the sort of technical stuff why this
 

00:51:45.540 --> 00:51:47.930
of the sort of technical stuff why this
stuff matters you know this kind of this

00:51:47.930 --> 00:51:47.940
stuff matters you know this kind of this
 

00:51:47.940 --> 00:51:50.420

like that and then there's just going to
 

00:54:11.140 --> 00:54:14.270
like that and then there's just going to
talk about the system like seeing the

00:54:14.270 --> 00:54:14.280
talk about the system like seeing the
 

00:54:14.280 --> 00:54:18.300
talk about the system like seeing the
neighborhood as a as a system so they

00:54:18.300 --> 00:54:18.310
neighborhood as a as a system so they
 

00:54:18.310 --> 00:54:21.590

channels to catch rain water so they do
 

00:54:28.540 --> 00:54:30.290
channels to catch rain water so they do
this whole rain water retention system

00:54:30.290 --> 00:54:30.300
this whole rain water retention system
 

00:54:30.300 --> 00:54:32.820

some of the structures are required to

00:54:32.820 --> 00:54:32.830
some of the structures are required to
 

00:54:32.830 --> 00:54:39.720
some of the structures are required to
have sedum on the roofs and that you

00:54:39.720 --> 00:54:39.730
have sedum on the roofs and that you
 

00:54:39.730 --> 00:54:41.640
have sedum on the roofs and that you
know is all is a lot of I mean I think a

00:54:41.640 --> 00:54:41.650
know is all is a lot of I mean I think a
 

00:54:41.650 --> 00:54:45.180
know is all is a lot of I mean I think a
lot of you know how good of an idea that

00:54:45.180 --> 00:54:45.190
lot of you know how good of an idea that
 

00:54:45.190 --> 00:54:49.080
lot of you know how good of an idea that
is and and then there's parts everywhere

00:54:49.080 --> 00:54:49.090
is and and then there's parts everywhere
 

00:54:49.090 --> 00:54:52.590
is and and then there's parts everywhere
so it was really like the way that the

00:54:52.590 --> 00:54:52.600
so it was really like the way that the
 

00:54:52.600 --> 00:54:54.900
so it was really like the way that the
place was designed was not only the

00:54:54.900 --> 00:54:54.910
place was designed was not only the
 

00:54:54.910 --> 00:54:57.390
place was designed was not only the
specific kind of architecture but then

00:54:57.390 --> 00:54:57.400
specific kind of architecture but then
 

00:54:57.400 --> 00:54:59.160
specific kind of architecture but then
you know they pulled back and they said

00:54:59.160 --> 00:54:59.170
you know they pulled back and they said
 

00:54:59.170 --> 00:55:00.900
you know they pulled back and they said
okay wait how do we want the rest of

00:55:00.900 --> 00:55:00.910
okay wait how do we want the rest of
 

00:55:00.910 --> 00:55:02.730
okay wait how do we want the rest of
this place to function what are the

00:55:02.730 --> 00:55:02.740
this place to function what are the
 

00:55:02.740 --> 00:55:05.310
this place to function what are the
social aspects you know it's not just

you know the technical stuff you know
 

00:55:08.560 --> 00:55:11.850
you know the technical stuff you know
it's also how we occupy the space and

00:55:11.850 --> 00:55:11.860
it's also how we occupy the space and
 

00:55:11.860 --> 00:55:14.490
it's also how we occupy the space and
how we interact with each other in the

00:55:14.490 --> 00:55:14.500
how we interact with each other in the
 

00:55:14.500 --> 00:55:17.790
how we interact with each other in the
neighborhood and the social engagement

00:55:17.790 --> 00:55:17.800
neighborhood and the social engagement
 

00:55:17.800 --> 00:55:20.370
neighborhood and the social engagement
that we have with ourselves and with the

00:55:20.370 --> 00:55:20.380
that we have with ourselves and with the
 

00:55:20.380 --> 00:55:23.630
that we have with ourselves and with the
environment how do we move around so the

00:55:23.630 --> 00:55:23.640
environment how do we move around so the
 

00:55:23.640 --> 00:55:25.160

transportation issues

00:55:25.160 --> 00:55:25.170
transportation issues
 

00:55:25.170 --> 00:55:28.099

parks became very important there's

00:55:28.099 --> 00:55:28.109
parks became very important there's
 

00:55:28.109 --> 00:55:30.049
parks became very important there's
another part parks and playgrounds they

00:55:30.049 --> 00:55:30.059
another part parks and playgrounds they
 

00:55:30.059 --> 00:55:31.640
another part parks and playgrounds they
built the playgrounds with a lot of the

00:55:31.640 --> 00:55:31.650
built the playgrounds with a lot of the
 

00:55:31.650 --> 00:55:35.420
built the playgrounds with a lot of the
kids and and then of course you know

00:55:35.420 --> 00:55:35.430
kids and and then of course you know
 

00:55:35.430 --> 00:55:39.260
kids and and then of course you know
this is um on on all the streets and it

00:55:39.260 --> 00:55:39.270
this is um on on all the streets and it
 

00:55:39.270 --> 00:55:41.109
this is um on on all the streets and it
says two cars that children and

so every apartment part of that they

00:55:53.180 --> 00:55:53.190
so every apartment part of that they
 

00:55:53.190 --> 00:55:54.680
so every apartment part of that they
came up with what they call the transfer

00:55:54.680 --> 00:55:54.690
came up with what they call the transfer
 

00:55:54.690 --> 00:55:56.930

their transportation concept and they

00:55:56.930 --> 00:55:56.940
their transportation concept and they
 

00:55:56.940 --> 00:55:58.370
their transportation concept and they
came up with this when they first did

00:55:58.370 --> 00:55:58.380
came up with this when they first did
 

00:55:58.380 --> 00:56:02.200
came up with this when they first did
the plan of vivant and one of the

00:56:02.200 --> 00:56:02.210
the plan of vivant and one of the
 

00:56:02.210 --> 00:56:04.579
the plan of vivant and one of the
aspects of the the transportation

00:56:04.579 --> 00:56:04.589
aspects of the the transportation
 

00:56:04.589 --> 00:56:09.280
aspects of the the transportation
concept was every building has to have a

00:56:09.280 --> 00:56:09.290
concept was every building has to have a
 

00:56:09.290 --> 00:56:12.620
concept was every building has to have a
shed for bicycles it has to have bicycle

00:56:12.620 --> 00:56:12.630

they also said we need really good mass
 

00:56:23.520 --> 00:56:25.309
they also said we need really good mass
transit there was no mass transit at the

00:56:25.309 --> 00:56:25.319
transit there was no mass transit at the
 

00:56:25.319 --> 00:56:26.960
transit there was no mass transit at the
time again they had to really wrangle

00:56:26.960 --> 00:56:26.970
time again they had to really wrangle
 

00:56:26.970 --> 00:56:29.990

with the city to get tramline a tram
line run out there and it takes about

00:56:32.620 --> 00:56:32.630
line run out there and it takes about
 

00:56:32.630 --> 00:56:35.390
line run out there and it takes about
you know 10 or 15 minutes to get to the

00:56:35.390 --> 00:56:35.400
you know 10 or 15 minutes to get to the
 

00:56:35.400 --> 00:56:39.410
you know 10 or 15 minutes to get to the
city center and it's very efficient so

00:56:39.410 --> 00:56:39.420
city center and it's very efficient so
 

00:56:39.420 --> 00:56:41.420
city center and it's very efficient so
you know like I said again it's this

00:56:41.420 --> 00:56:41.430
you know like I said again it's this
 

00:56:41.430 --> 00:56:43.970
you know like I said again it's this
process of engagement and it wasn't easy

00:56:43.970 --> 00:56:43.980
process of engagement and it wasn't easy
 

00:56:43.980 --> 00:56:47.539
process of engagement and it wasn't easy
but it happened and you can also see

00:56:47.539 --> 00:56:47.549
but it happened and you can also see
 

00:56:47.549 --> 00:56:52.819
but it happened and you can also see
here more of the multi-family houses now

00:56:52.819 --> 00:56:52.829
here more of the multi-family houses now
 

00:56:52.829 --> 00:56:55.460
here more of the multi-family houses now
another key part of the traffic concept

00:56:55.460 --> 00:56:55.470
another key part of the traffic concept
 

00:56:55.470 --> 00:57:00.039
another key part of the traffic concept
was that no cars are allowed on a

00:57:00.039 --> 00:57:00.049
was that no cars are allowed on a
 

00:57:00.049 --> 00:57:03.079
was that no cars are allowed on a
neighborhood streets you can park and

00:57:03.079 --> 00:57:03.089
neighborhood streets you can park and
 

00:57:03.089 --> 00:57:04.670
neighborhood streets you can park and
unload and then you have to move your

00:57:04.670 --> 00:57:04.680
unload and then you have to move your
 

00:57:04.680 --> 00:57:08.120
unload and then you have to move your
car you cannot leave it and the idea was

00:57:08.120 --> 00:57:08.130
car you cannot leave it and the idea was
 

00:57:08.130 --> 00:57:11.000
car you cannot leave it and the idea was
that and you have to park it even the

00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:11.010
that and you have to park it even the
 

00:57:11.010 --> 00:57:14.480
that and you have to park it even the

to not have cars you know and there's
 

00:57:54.900 --> 00:57:56.510
to not have cars you know and there's
there's this idea in the united states

there's this idea in the united states
 

00:57:56.520 --> 00:57:59.330
there's this idea in the united states
that well you know people want cars they

00:57:59.330 --> 00:57:59.340
that well you know people want cars they
 

00:57:59.340 --> 00:58:01.100
that well you know people want cars they
don't want mass transit that's why we

00:58:01.100 --> 00:58:01.110
don't want mass transit that's why we
 

00:58:01.110 --> 00:58:03.800
don't want mass transit that's why we
give them cars and actually you know I

00:58:03.800 --> 00:58:03.810
give them cars and actually you know I
 

00:58:03.810 --> 00:58:05.840
give them cars and actually you know I
want really good mass transit and I'm

00:58:05.840 --> 00:58:05.850
want really good mass transit and I'm
 

00:58:05.850 --> 00:58:07.790

lucky to live in New York City but when

00:58:07.790 --> 00:58:07.800
lucky to live in New York City but when
 

00:58:07.800 --> 00:58:10.190
lucky to live in New York City but when
i lived in other places I couldn't have

00:58:10.190 --> 00:58:10.200
i lived in other places I couldn't have
 

00:58:10.200 --> 00:58:15.100
i lived in other places I couldn't have
it so the market doesn't always deliver

00:58:15.100 --> 00:58:15.110
 
 

00:58:15.110 --> 00:58:17.900
 
yeah you could talk more about that

00:58:17.900 --> 00:58:17.910
yeah you could talk more about that
 

00:58:17.910 --> 00:58:21.230
yeah you could talk more about that
later but um so this has been very

00:58:21.230 --> 00:58:21.240
later but um so this has been very
 

00:58:21.240 --> 00:58:23.420
later but um so this has been very
effective and the city again has fought

00:58:23.420 --> 00:58:23.430
effective and the city again has fought
 

00:58:23.430 --> 00:58:25.730
effective and the city again has fought

use it and then I'm just going to talk

00:59:17.810 --> 00:59:17.820
use it and then I'm just going to talk
 

00:59:17.820 --> 00:59:20.030
use it and then I'm just going to talk
quickly about the energy where they get

00:59:20.030 --> 00:59:20.040
quickly about the energy where they get
 

00:59:20.040 --> 00:59:23.230
quickly about the energy where they get
their energy and like I said they use

00:59:23.230 --> 00:59:23.240
their energy and like I said they use
 

00:59:23.240 --> 00:59:26.180
their energy and like I said they use
that this is the main power plant for

00:59:26.180 --> 00:59:26.190
that this is the main power plant for

and it's a combined heat and power plant

00:59:39.310 --> 00:59:39.320
and it's a combined heat and power plant
 

00:59:39.320 --> 00:59:43.490

typical power plant what they do is they

00:59:47.030 --> 00:59:47.040
typical power plant what they do is they
 

00:59:47.040 --> 00:59:49.670
typical power plant what they do is they
generate electricity and then all of the

00:59:49.670 --> 00:59:49.680
generate electricity and then all of the
 

00:59:49.680 --> 00:59:51.980

heat that comes out of that generation
 

00:59:51.990 --> 00:59:55.970
heat that comes out of that generation
of electricity is lost that's what the

00:59:55.970 --> 00:59:55.980
of electricity is lost that's what the
 

00:59:55.980 --> 00:59:59.870
of electricity is lost that's what the
cooling towers are for and what a

combined heat and power plant does is it

01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:02.850
combined heat and power plant does is it
 

01:00:02.850 --> 01:00:05.900
combined heat and power plant does is it
captures that heat and it sends it to

01:00:05.900 --> 01:00:05.910
captures that heat and it sends it to
 

01:00:05.910 --> 01:00:09.650

dramatic shift one of the reasons why
some utilities don't like it is that you

01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:23.130
some utilities don't like it is that you
 

01:00:23.130 --> 01:00:25.880
some utilities don't like it is that you
have to have a smaller facility and you

01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:25.890
have to have a smaller facility and you
 

01:00:25.890 --> 01:00:28.040
have to have a smaller facility and you
have to in order to to do the

01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:28.050
have to in order to to do the
 

01:00:28.050 --> 01:00:29.810

distributed heat it's also called

01:00:29.810 --> 01:00:29.820
distributed heat it's also called
 

01:00:29.820 --> 01:00:33.170
distributed heat it's also called
distributed power and heat so because

01:00:33.170 --> 01:00:33.180
distributed power and heat so because
 

01:00:33.180 --> 01:00:35.150
distributed power and heat so because
you have to run lines to the buildings

01:00:35.150 --> 01:00:35.160
you have to run lines to the buildings
 

01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:37.070
you have to run lines to the buildings
around to take advantage of that heat

01:00:37.070 --> 01:00:37.080
around to take advantage of that heat
 

01:00:37.080 --> 01:00:39.410
around to take advantage of that heat
that you capture so that's the kind of

01:00:39.410 --> 01:00:39.420
that you capture so that's the kind of
 

01:00:39.420 --> 01:00:41.930

during World War two fiber was heavily

01:06:25.450 --> 01:06:25.460
during World War two fiber was heavily
 

01:06:25.460 --> 01:06:28.180
during World War two fiber was heavily
bombed and and when that same woman that

right and this kind of generational and
 

01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:48.210
right and this kind of generational and
in the generation that's still there of

01:06:48.210 --> 01:06:48.220
in the generation that's still there of
 

01:06:48.220 --> 01:06:50.890
in the generation that's still there of
destruction of what it could actually be

01:06:50.890 --> 01:06:50.900

earlier on also talked about that what
 

02:08:13.410 --> 02:08:15.260

are the systems we can put in place or

02:08:15.260 --> 02:08:15.270
are the systems we can put in place or
 

02:08:15.270 --> 02:08:18.050
are the systems we can put in place or

for student studios as well to looking

02:10:37.880 --> 02:10:37.890
for student studios as well to looking

for student studios as well to looking
at systems and discussions that in fact

at systems and discussions that in fact
 

02:10:40.680 --> 02:10:43.610
at systems and discussions that in fact
have a much broader impact but

unit how do you take that so for us it's

02:10:52.700 --> 02:10:52.710
unit how do you take that so for us it's
 

02:10:52.710 --> 02:10:55.430
unit how do you take that so for us it's
a question of designing how to design

02:10:55.430 --> 02:10:55.440
a question of designing how to design
 

02:10:55.440 --> 02:10:58.280
a question of designing how to design
and how do we communicate and positive

02:10:58.280 --> 02:10:58.290
and how do we communicate and positive
 

02:10:58.290 --> 02:11:03.050
and how do we communicate and positive
how do we use all and then how do we

02:11:03.050 --> 02:11:03.060
how do we use all and then how do we
 

02:11:03.060 --> 02:11:05.510
how do we use all and then how do we
communicate so the students take charge

02:11:05.510 --> 02:11:05.520
communicate so the students take charge
 

02:11:05.520 --> 02:11:08.240

of the gang on how to design we would

02:11:08.240 --> 02:11:08.250
of the gang on how to design we would
 

02:11:08.250 --> 02:11:09.860
of the gang on how to design we would
like very much to create a discussion of

02:11:09.860 --> 02:11:09.870
like very much to create a discussion of
 

02:11:09.870 --> 02:11:13.010
like very much to create a discussion of
the implementation to our studios we are

02:11:13.010 --> 02:11:13.020
the implementation to our studios we are
 

02:11:13.020 --> 02:11:15.440
the implementation to our studios we are
hoping that this type of responsibility

02:11:15.440 --> 02:11:15.450
hoping that this type of responsibility

to figure out how to do it I want to

02:11:32.120 --> 02:11:32.130
to figure out how to do it I want to
 

02:11:32.130 --> 02:11:34.460
to figure out how to do it I want to
pick up on this idea of systems because

02:11:34.460 --> 02:11:34.470
pick up on this idea of systems because
 

02:11:34.470 --> 02:11:36.350
pick up on this idea of systems because
i think what both presentations have

so so for this new kind of cities

02:11:55.689 --> 02:11:55.699
so so for this new kind of cities
 

02:11:55.699 --> 02:11:57.670
so so for this new kind of cities

be like the new infrastructures right
like so all of a sudden a cell phone

02:12:02.470 --> 02:12:02.480
like so all of a sudden a cell phone

the cell phone was that you know when it
 

02:12:12.050 --> 02:12:15.100
the cell phone was that you know when it
was popularized the late nineties so

02:12:15.100 --> 02:12:15.110
was popularized the late nineties so
 

02:12:15.110 --> 02:12:18.610
was popularized the late nineties so
even that is changing right now we have

02:12:18.610 --> 02:12:18.620
even that is changing right now we have
 

02:12:18.620 --> 02:12:21.100
even that is changing right now we have
all sorts of new technologies what might

02:12:21.100 --> 02:12:21.110
all sorts of new technologies what might
 

02:12:21.110 --> 02:12:22.720
all sorts of new technologies what might
be the new kind of infrastructure for a

be the new kind of infrastructure for a
 

02:12:22.730 --> 02:12:25.510
be the new kind of infrastructure for a
city of process or in fact does the city

just a physical infrastructure but you
 

02:13:07.370 --> 02:13:09.790
just a physical infrastructure but you
need a physical infrastructure to you

we can just turn it into bit and then

02:21:45.750 --> 02:21:45.760
we can just turn it into bit and then
 

02:21:45.760 --> 02:21:48.900
we can just turn it into bit and then
it's it's still works but it's much

02:21:48.900 --> 02:21:48.910
it's it's still works but it's much
 

02:21:48.910 --> 02:21:50.910
it's it's still works but it's much
better for the environment for all them

02:21:50.910 --> 02:21:50.920
better for the environment for all them
 

02:21:50.920 --> 02:21:53.880
better for the environment for all them
so like that well the weights you know I

02:21:53.880 --> 02:21:53.890
so like that well the weights you know I
 

02:21:53.890 --> 02:21:56.599
so like that well the weights you know I
mean can you can you use actually your

02:21:56.599 --> 02:21:56.609
mean can you can you use actually your
 

02:21:56.609 --> 02:21:59.760
mean can you can you use actually your
Facebook page can you use stuff it's

02:21:59.760 --> 02:21:59.770
Facebook page can you use stuff it's
 

02:21:59.770 --> 02:22:01.950
Facebook page can you use stuff it's
online can use the music you listen to

02:22:01.950 --> 02:22:01.960
online can use the music you listen to
 

02:22:01.960 --> 02:22:03.780
online can use the music you listen to
you need to buy a Ferrari anymore but

02:22:03.780 --> 02:22:03.790
you need to buy a Ferrari anymore but
 

02:22:03.790 --> 02:22:07.860
you need to buy a Ferrari anymore but
you graduate so do the same use the same

02:22:07.860 --> 02:22:07.870
you graduate so do the same use the same
 

02:22:07.870 --> 02:22:11.099
you graduate so do the same use the same
mechanism to through digital information

02:22:11.099 --> 02:22:11.109
mechanism to through digital information
 

02:22:11.109 --> 02:22:12.810
mechanism to through digital information
that you show in you share with the

02:22:12.810 --> 02:22:12.820
that you show in you share with the
 

02:22:12.820 --> 02:22:14.400
that you show in you share with the
community so can you actually go from

02:22:14.400 --> 02:22:14.410
community so can you actually go from
 

02:22:14.410 --> 02:22:16.139
community so can you actually go from
physical consumption to digital

02:22:16.139 --> 02:22:16.149
physical consumption to digital
 

02:22:16.149 --> 02:22:17.610
physical consumption to digital
consumption and I think that's a very

02:22:17.610 --> 02:22:17.620
consumption and I think that's a very
 

02:22:17.620 --> 02:22:18.840
consumption and I think that's a very
good challenge and the thing that's a

02:22:18.840 --> 02:22:18.850
good challenge and the thing that's a
 

02:22:18.850 --> 02:22:20.700
good challenge and the thing that's a
great challenge for architects nor can

02:22:20.700 --> 02:22:20.710
great challenge for architects nor can
 

02:22:20.710 --> 02:22:22.429
great challenge for architects nor can
we actually promote this can actually

02:22:22.429 --> 02:22:22.439
we actually promote this can actually
 

02:22:22.439 --> 02:22:24.630
we actually promote this can actually
ourself design system that allow the

02:22:24.630 --> 02:22:24.640
ourself design system that allow the
 

02:22:24.640 --> 02:22:26.910
ourself design system that allow the
same mechanism happen in a vest waste

02:22:26.910 --> 02:22:26.920
same mechanism happen in a vest waste
 

02:22:26.920 --> 02:22:32.040
same mechanism happen in a vest waste
boom what yeah and I mean I guess I have

02:22:32.040 --> 02:22:32.050
boom what yeah and I mean I guess I have
 

02:22:32.050 --> 02:22:37.139
boom what yeah and I mean I guess I have
the like analog Corp correlation to that

02:22:37.139 --> 02:22:37.149
the like analog Corp correlation to that
 

02:22:37.149 --> 02:22:40.590
the like analog Corp correlation to that
which is just that like redefining what

02:22:40.590 --> 02:22:40.600
which is just that like redefining what
 

02:22:40.600 --> 02:22:42.990
which is just that like redefining what
is consumption you know and what is it

02:22:42.990 --> 02:22:43.000
is consumption you know and what is it
 

02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:44.070
is consumption you know and what is it
because I think a lot of people when

02:22:44.070 --> 02:22:44.080
because I think a lot of people when
 

02:22:44.080 --> 02:22:45.929
because I think a lot of people when
they talk about environmental stuff and

02:22:45.929 --> 02:22:45.939
they talk about environmental stuff and
 

02:22:45.939 --> 02:22:47.429
they talk about environmental stuff and
I like don't consume

02:22:47.429 --> 02:22:47.439
I like don't consume
 

02:22:47.439 --> 02:22:51.689
I like don't consume
we're just we're greedy and we want

02:22:51.689 --> 02:22:51.699
we're just we're greedy and we want
 

02:22:51.699 --> 02:22:54.300
we're just we're greedy and we want
everything now and you know and this

02:22:54.300 --> 02:22:54.310
everything now and you know and this
 

02:22:54.310 --> 02:22:55.410
everything now and you know and this
kind of thing and that's just human

02:22:55.410 --> 02:22:55.420
kind of thing and that's just human
 

02:22:55.420 --> 02:22:57.929
kind of thing and that's just human
nature and there are some aspects of

02:22:57.929 --> 02:22:57.939
nature and there are some aspects of
 

02:22:57.939 --> 02:22:59.969
nature and there are some aspects of
that that are part of human nature I

02:22:59.969 --> 02:22:59.979
that that are part of human nature I
 

02:22:59.979 --> 02:23:02.969
that that are part of human nature I
mean we do we do have desire and and we

02:23:02.969 --> 02:23:02.979
mean we do we do have desire and and we
 

02:23:02.979 --> 02:23:07.500
mean we do we do have desire and and we
do have you know sensual we seek sensual

02:23:07.500 --> 02:23:07.510
do have you know sensual we seek sensual
 

02:23:07.510 --> 02:23:10.819
do have you know sensual we seek sensual
gratification and things like that and

02:23:10.819 --> 02:23:10.829
gratification and things like that and
 

02:23:10.829 --> 02:23:13.319
gratification and things like that and
but there are so many ways that we can

02:23:13.319 --> 02:23:13.329
but there are so many ways that we can
 

02:23:13.329 --> 02:23:16.410
but there are so many ways that we can
you know meet those needs and desires

02:23:16.410 --> 02:23:16.420
you know meet those needs and desires
 

02:23:16.420 --> 02:23:19.080
you know meet those needs and desires
and I think it's so important to you

02:23:19.080 --> 02:23:19.090
and I think it's so important to you
 

02:23:19.090 --> 02:23:22.590
and I think it's so important to you
know to value that and I just think it's

02:23:22.590 --> 02:23:22.600
know to value that and I just think it's
 

02:23:22.600 --> 02:23:24.630
know to value that and I just think it's
so often it gets that all of that like

02:23:24.630 --> 02:23:24.640
so often it gets that all of that like
 

02:23:24.640 --> 02:23:25.739
so often it gets that all of that like
the baby gets thrown out with the

02:23:25.739 --> 02:23:25.749
the baby gets thrown out with the
 

02:23:25.749 --> 02:23:27.179
the baby gets thrown out with the
bathwater when you're talking about

02:23:27.179 --> 02:23:27.189
bathwater when you're talking about
 

02:23:27.189 --> 02:23:29.279
bathwater when you're talking about
reducing consumption and more

02:23:29.279 --> 02:23:29.289
reducing consumption and more
 

02:23:29.289 --> 02:23:32.489
reducing consumption and more
efficiencies and conservation things

02:23:32.489 --> 02:23:32.499
efficiencies and conservation things
 

02:23:32.499 --> 02:23:35.910
efficiencies and conservation things
like that there's so there's so much I

02:23:35.910 --> 02:23:35.920
like that there's so there's so much I
 

02:23:35.920 --> 02:23:37.319
like that there's so there's so much I
can't remember if I talked about this

02:23:37.319 --> 02:23:37.329
can't remember if I talked about this
 

02:23:37.329 --> 02:23:40.429
can't remember if I talked about this
the first time when I sub last time but

02:23:40.429 --> 02:23:40.439
the first time when I sub last time but
 

02:23:40.439 --> 02:23:42.929
the first time when I sub last time but
you know I think there's a lot of ways

02:23:42.929 --> 02:23:42.939
you know I think there's a lot of ways
 

02:23:42.939 --> 02:23:46.410
you know I think there's a lot of ways
that that we can start to pull apart you

02:23:46.410 --> 02:23:46.420
that that we can start to pull apart you
 

02:23:46.420 --> 02:23:50.399
that that we can start to pull apart you
know growth which is like our standard

02:23:50.399 --> 02:23:50.409
know growth which is like our standard
 

02:23:50.409 --> 02:23:52.410
know growth which is like our standard
of living and our well-being currently

02:23:52.410 --> 02:23:52.420
of living and our well-being currently
 

02:23:52.420 --> 02:23:55.769
of living and our well-being currently
is defined based on the growth of our

02:23:55.769 --> 02:23:55.779
is defined based on the growth of our
 

02:23:55.779 --> 02:23:57.389
is defined based on the growth of our
economy and what our economy isn't

02:23:57.389 --> 02:23:57.399
economy and what our economy isn't
 

02:23:57.399 --> 02:23:59.630
economy and what our economy isn't
growing as is happening right now

02:23:59.630 --> 02:23:59.640
growing as is happening right now
 

02:23:59.640 --> 02:24:02.130
growing as is happening right now
people's quality of life their

02:24:02.130 --> 02:24:02.140
people's quality of life their
 

02:24:02.140 --> 02:24:06.300
people's quality of life their
livelihoods decrease and I think that it

02:24:06.300 --> 02:24:06.310
livelihoods decrease and I think that it
 

02:24:06.310 --> 02:24:09.750
livelihoods decrease and I think that it
could be really useful to pull apart two

02:24:09.750 --> 02:24:09.760
could be really useful to pull apart two
 

02:24:09.760 --> 02:24:12.559
could be really useful to pull apart two
separate outgrowth from development I

02:24:12.559 --> 02:24:12.569
separate outgrowth from development I
 

02:24:12.569 --> 02:24:16.439
separate outgrowth from development I
could call development or you know kind

02:24:16.439 --> 02:24:16.449
could call development or you know kind
 

02:24:16.449 --> 02:24:20.069
could call development or you know kind
of livelihood that we have I think that

02:24:20.069 --> 02:24:20.079
of livelihood that we have I think that
 

02:24:20.079 --> 02:24:21.929
of livelihood that we have I think that
we can have a very good standard of

02:24:21.929 --> 02:24:21.939
we can have a very good standard of
 

02:24:21.939 --> 02:24:25.859
we can have a very good standard of
living in an in an economy that that

02:24:25.859 --> 02:24:25.869
living in an in an economy that that
 

02:24:25.869 --> 02:24:28.019
living in an in an economy that that
isn't predicated on growth the kind of

02:24:28.019 --> 02:24:28.029
isn't predicated on growth the kind of
 

02:24:28.029 --> 02:24:31.469
isn't predicated on growth the kind of
growth that we have right now and in

02:24:31.469 --> 02:24:31.479
growth that we have right now and in
 

02:24:31.479 --> 02:24:33.960
growth that we have right now and in
doing that I think could open up a lot

02:24:33.960 --> 02:24:33.970
doing that I think could open up a lot
 

02:24:33.970 --> 02:24:39.779
doing that I think could open up a lot
of room to you know create new kinds of

02:24:39.779 --> 02:24:39.789
of room to you know create new kinds of
 

02:24:39.789 --> 02:24:43.710
of room to you know create new kinds of
satisfaction without the destruction

02:24:43.710 --> 02:24:43.720
satisfaction without the destruction
 

02:24:43.720 --> 02:24:46.710
satisfaction without the destruction
that so often comes along with

02:24:46.710 --> 02:24:46.720
that so often comes along with
 

02:24:46.720 --> 02:24:51.360

do you think that the new technology of
 

02:25:31.540 --> 02:25:36.219
do you think that the new technology of
transforming waste into the alternative

02:25:36.219 --> 02:25:36.229
transforming waste into the alternative
 

02:25:36.229 --> 02:25:38.380
transforming waste into the alternative
fuel will have a big impact on the city

02:25:38.380 --> 02:25:38.390
fuel will have a big impact on the city
 

02:25:38.390 --> 02:25:40.979
fuel will have a big impact on the city
and that's like I'm talking about a

02:25:40.979 --> 02:25:40.989
and that's like I'm talking about a
 

02:25:40.989 --> 02:25:44.729
and that's like I'm talking about a
waste gasification or the plastic

interesting in the bottom of approach
 

02:25:56.210 --> 02:25:59.349
interesting in the bottom of approach
and I would like to if you can elaborate

02:25:59.349 --> 02:25:59.359
and I would like to if you can elaborate
 

02:25:59.359 --> 02:26:02.260
and I would like to if you can elaborate
a little bit more on is what about the

a little bit more on is what about the
 

02:26:02.270 --> 02:26:06.479
a little bit more on is what about the
bottom-up approach and when exactly this

very interesting developments I think

02:26:37.070 --> 02:26:37.080
very interesting developments I think
 

02:26:37.080 --> 02:26:39.010
very interesting developments I think
one of the most promising one is plasma

02:26:39.010 --> 02:26:39.020
one of the most promising one is plasma
 

02:26:39.020 --> 02:26:42.590

you know when when you burn this this

02:26:42.590 --> 02:26:42.600
you know when when you burn this this
 

02:26:42.600 --> 02:26:44.030
you know when when you burn this this
plastic bottle and by the way you

02:26:44.030 --> 02:26:44.040
plastic bottle and by the way you
 

02:26:44.040 --> 02:26:45.320
plastic bottle and by the way you
shouldn't have plastic bottles of you

02:26:45.320 --> 02:26:45.330
shouldn't have plastic bottles of you
 

02:26:45.330 --> 02:26:47.380
shouldn't have plastic bottles of you
don't only one a panel and waste here

02:26:47.380 --> 02:26:47.390
don't only one a panel and waste here
 

02:26:47.390 --> 02:26:50.410
don't only one a panel and waste here
but if you burn this plastic bottle

02:26:50.410 --> 02:26:50.420
but if you burn this plastic bottle
 

02:26:50.420 --> 02:26:54.110
but if you burn this plastic bottle
there's a lot of molecules that gets

02:26:54.110 --> 02:26:54.120
there's a lot of molecules that gets
 

02:26:54.120 --> 02:26:56.600
there's a lot of molecules that gets
produced in a lot of them are toxic in

their toxic because our complex

02:26:58.280 --> 02:26:58.290
their toxic because our complex
 

02:26:58.290 --> 02:27:00.800
their toxic because our complex
molecules in the our body doesn't

02:27:00.800 --> 02:27:00.810
molecules in the our body doesn't

interface very nicely with it now if you

02:27:03.410 --> 02:27:03.420
interface very nicely with it now if you
 

02:27:03.420 --> 02:27:05.870

burn it however very high temperature in

02:27:05.870 --> 02:27:05.880
burn it however very high temperature in
 

02:27:05.880 --> 02:27:08.960
burn it however very high temperature in
plasma you reach plasma level then at

02:27:08.960 --> 02:27:08.970
plasma you reach plasma level then at
 

02:27:08.970 --> 02:27:12.020
plasma you reach plasma level then at
that level all of the molecules break

02:27:12.020 --> 02:27:12.030
that level all of the molecules break
 

02:27:12.030 --> 02:27:15.400
that level all of the molecules break
down into atoms and then you get the

02:27:15.400 --> 02:27:15.410
down into atoms and then you get the
 

02:27:15.410 --> 02:27:19.820
down into atoms and then you get the
elemental the individual atoms out out

02:27:19.820 --> 02:27:19.830
elemental the individual atoms out out
 

02:27:19.830 --> 02:27:22.429
elemental the individual atoms out out
of the process and if you do that you

02:27:22.429 --> 02:27:22.439
of the process and if you do that you
 

02:27:22.439 --> 02:27:25.210
of the process and if you do that you
get something that is the best way to

02:27:25.210 --> 02:27:25.220
get something that is the best way to
 

02:27:25.220 --> 02:27:28.690
get something that is the best way to
treat it's used today to treat a lot of

treat it's used today to treat a lot of
 

02:27:28.700 --> 02:27:35.330
treat it's used today to treat a lot of
very polluting very toxic waste but that

02:27:35.330 --> 02:27:35.340
very polluting very toxic waste but that
 

02:27:35.340 --> 02:27:37.370
very polluting very toxic waste but that
tomorrow might become much more common

02:27:37.370 --> 02:27:37.380
tomorrow might become much more common

to you but we're not sure because they
 

02:30:46.520 --> 02:30:49.030
to you but we're not sure because they
did kind of want to just you know sell

02:30:49.030 --> 02:30:49.040
did kind of want to just you know sell
 

02:30:49.040 --> 02:30:50.740

it to commercial developers and just

02:30:50.740 --> 02:30:50.750
it to commercial developers and just
 

02:30:50.750 --> 02:30:52.990
it to commercial developers and just
carry on as they have been doing because

you know it's not as much of a community
 

02:32:44.390 --> 02:32:47.529
you know it's not as much of a community
and there's a lot more cars and it's you

02:32:47.529 --> 02:32:47.539
and there's a lot more cars and it's you
 

02:32:47.539 --> 02:32:50.909
and there's a lot more cars and it's you
know there's a lot there's a lot less of

environmental so i think that's an

02:33:02.829 --> 02:33:02.839
environmental so i think that's an
 

02:33:02.839 --> 02:33:05.739
environmental so i think that's an
interesting comparison and if there's a

02:33:05.739 --> 02:33:05.749
interesting comparison and if there's a
 

02:33:05.749 --> 02:33:10.449
interesting comparison and if there's a
kind of rivalry between the two I could

02:33:10.449 --> 02:33:10.459
kind of rivalry between the two I could
 

02:33:10.459 --> 02:33:12.579
kind of rivalry between the two I could
follow up really quickly um I remember

02:33:12.579 --> 02:33:12.589
follow up really quickly um I remember
 

02:33:12.589 --> 02:33:14.469
follow up really quickly um I remember
your first lecture we talked a little

02:33:14.469 --> 02:33:14.479
your first lecture we talked a little
 

02:33:14.479 --> 02:33:17.050
your first lecture we talked a little
bit about the stigma of trash and when

02:33:17.050 --> 02:33:17.060
bit about the stigma of trash and when
 

02:33:17.060 --> 02:33:18.909
bit about the stigma of trash and when
that switch happened when the rag

02:33:18.909 --> 02:33:18.919
that switch happened when the rag

then when it became you know you don't

02:33:22.210 --> 02:33:22.220
then when it became you know you don't
 

02:33:22.220 --> 02:33:23.920

of our research and field trips looked

02:33:29.260 --> 02:33:29.270
of our research and field trips looked
 

02:33:29.270 --> 02:33:30.579
of our research and field trips looked
at ways to energy and there's such a

02:33:30.579 --> 02:33:30.589
at ways to energy and there's such a
 

02:33:30.589 --> 02:33:32.529
at ways to energy and there's such a
stigma no matter how many facts can be

02:33:32.529 --> 02:33:32.539
stigma no matter how many facts can be
 

02:33:32.539 --> 02:33:35.199

once there is rubys it's interesting to

02:33:38.139 --> 02:33:38.149
once there is rubys it's interesting to
 

02:33:38.149 --> 02:33:42.510
once there is rubys it's interesting to
observe that this uses biomass in

02:33:42.510 --> 02:33:42.520

and I'm just wondering in your

02:33:43.800 --> 02:33:43.810
and I'm just wondering in your
 

02:33:43.810 --> 02:33:47.099
and I'm just wondering in your
estimation it that's more acceptable to

02:33:47.099 --> 02:33:47.109
estimation it that's more acceptable to
 

02:33:47.109 --> 02:33:49.050

the burning of the wood chip and it

02:34:04.889 --> 02:34:04.899
the burning of the wood chip and it
 

02:34:04.899 --> 02:34:13.679
the burning of the wood chip and it
would be waste waste well you know I

02:34:13.679 --> 02:34:13.689
would be waste waste well you know I
 

02:34:13.689 --> 02:34:16.229
would be waste waste well you know I
just want to follow because Germany is

02:34:16.229 --> 02:34:16.239
just want to follow because Germany is
 

02:34:16.239 --> 02:34:17.609
just want to follow because Germany is
one of the countries that is very

02:34:17.609 --> 02:34:17.619
one of the countries that is very
 

02:34:17.619 --> 02:34:21.059
one of the countries that is very
advanced to waste our energy and they do

02:34:21.059 --> 02:34:21.069
advanced to waste our energy and they do
 

02:34:21.069 --> 02:34:23.279
advanced to waste our energy and they do
have it in small communities in larger

02:34:23.279 --> 02:34:23.289
have it in small communities in larger
 

02:34:23.289 --> 02:34:25.729
have it in small communities in larger
cities they built many keys around these

02:34:25.729 --> 02:34:25.739
cities they built many keys around these
 

02:34:25.739 --> 02:34:28.200
cities they built many keys around these
plants and because the communities

02:34:28.200 --> 02:34:28.210
plants and because the communities
 

02:34:28.210 --> 02:34:30.750
plants and because the communities
directed benefit from it it's actually

02:34:30.750 --> 02:34:30.760
directed benefit from it it's actually
 

02:34:30.760 --> 02:34:34.319
directed benefit from it it's actually
quite popular if there's a discussion

02:34:34.319 --> 02:34:34.329
quite popular if there's a discussion
 

02:34:34.329 --> 02:34:37.939
quite popular if there's a discussion
now that is also it's quite clean again

02:34:37.939 --> 02:34:37.949
now that is also it's quite clean again
 

02:34:37.949 --> 02:34:40.500
now that is also it's quite clean again
it's fascinating because like you have

02:34:40.500 --> 02:34:40.510
it's fascinating because like you have
 

02:34:40.510 --> 02:34:43.279
it's fascinating because like you have
in developing countries you have

02:34:43.279 --> 02:34:43.289
in developing countries you have
 

02:34:43.289 --> 02:34:45.269
in developing countries you have
development projects coming in and

02:34:45.269 --> 02:34:45.279
development projects coming in and
 

02:34:45.279 --> 02:34:48.000
development projects coming in and
saying you know these people are burning

02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:48.010
saying you know these people are burning
 

02:34:48.010 --> 02:34:51.569
saying you know these people are burning
they have these like wood-fired cook

02:34:51.569 --> 02:34:51.579
they have these like wood-fired cook
 

02:34:51.579 --> 02:34:53.819
they have these like wood-fired cook
stoves and you need to like get them gas

02:34:53.819 --> 02:34:53.829
stoves and you need to like get them gas
 

02:34:53.829 --> 02:34:56.370
stoves and you need to like get them gas
or whatever and then and then now

02:34:56.370 --> 02:34:56.380
or whatever and then and then now
 

02:34:56.380 --> 02:34:59.149
or whatever and then and then now
suddenly burning wood is is

02:34:59.149 --> 02:34:59.159
suddenly burning wood is is
 

02:34:59.159 --> 02:35:12.350
suddenly burning wood is is
environmentally

02:35:12.350 --> 02:35:12.360
 
 

02:35:12.360 --> 02:35:14.331
 
also like this whole thing about the

02:35:14.331 --> 02:35:14.341
also like this whole thing about the
 

02:35:14.341 --> 02:35:17.690
also like this whole thing about the
plasma I mean I think that's you know

02:35:17.690 --> 02:35:17.700
plasma I mean I think that's you know
 

02:35:17.700 --> 02:35:22.011
plasma I mean I think that's you know
that's important but that you if you can

02:35:22.011 --> 02:35:22.021

I often have questions about because I

02:42:26.590 --> 02:42:26.600
I often have questions about because I
 

02:42:26.600 --> 02:42:33.051
I often have questions about because I
think design is very important

02:42:33.051 --> 02:42:33.061
 
 

02:42:33.061 --> 02:42:39.171
 
oh really everybody's used to it it's a

02:42:39.171 --> 02:42:39.181
oh really everybody's used to it it's a
 

02:42:39.181 --> 02:42:44.961
oh really everybody's used to it it's a
design flaw um but it is that okay a big

02:42:44.961 --> 02:42:44.971
design flaw um but it is that okay a big
 

02:42:44.971 --> 02:42:47.690
design flaw um but it is that okay a big
part of it is design but also you know

02:42:47.690 --> 02:42:47.700
part of it is design but also you know
 

02:42:47.700 --> 02:42:50.331

the reason that the printer cartridge

02:42:50.331 --> 02:42:50.341
the reason that the printer cartridge
 

02:42:50.341 --> 02:42:53.211
the reason that the printer cartridge
goes from Seattle to Florida isn't

02:42:53.211 --> 02:42:53.221
goes from Seattle to Florida isn't
 

02:42:53.221 --> 02:42:55.520
goes from Seattle to Florida isn't
because they just don't realize that

02:42:55.520 --> 02:42:55.530
because they just don't realize that
 

02:42:55.530 --> 02:42:57.320
because they just don't realize that
it's inefficient it's because there

02:42:57.320 --> 02:42:57.330
it's inefficient it's because there
 

02:42:57.330 --> 02:43:00.801
it's inefficient it's because there
there's a certain logic at work and that

02:43:00.801 --> 02:43:00.811
there's a certain logic at work and that
 

02:43:00.811 --> 02:43:04.100
there's a certain logic at work and that
logic within that logic it is efficient

02:43:04.100 --> 02:43:04.110
logic within that logic it is efficient
 

02:43:04.110 --> 02:43:07.461

but we had an interesting conversation

02:46:45.330 --> 02:46:45.340
but we had an interesting conversation
 

02:46:45.340 --> 02:46:49.480
but we had an interesting conversation
last week about economy and there's a

02:46:49.480 --> 02:46:49.490
last week about economy and there's a
 

02:46:49.490 --> 02:46:51.700
last week about economy and there's a
lot of data out there and you know some

02:46:51.700 --> 02:46:51.710
lot of data out there and you know some
 

02:46:51.710 --> 02:46:54.460

the beginning is what we could be more

02:46:58.630 --> 02:46:58.640
the beginning is what we could be more
 

02:46:58.640 --> 02:47:01.330
the beginning is what we could be more
efficient at destroying our planet and

02:47:01.330 --> 02:47:01.340
efficient at destroying our planet and
 

02:47:01.340 --> 02:47:03.550
efficient at destroying our planet and
so we could do things efficiently and

02:47:03.550 --> 02:47:03.560
so we could do things efficiently and
 

02:47:03.560 --> 02:47:05.860
so we could do things efficiently and
consume more and more I forget which

02:47:05.860 --> 02:47:05.870
consume more and more I forget which

paradox but you're saying something of

02:47:08.110 --> 02:47:08.120
paradox but you're saying something of
 

02:47:08.120 --> 02:47:11.640
paradox but you're saying something of
that as we make things more efficient

02:47:11.640 --> 02:47:11.650
that as we make things more efficient
 

02:47:11.650 --> 02:47:13.990
that as we make things more efficient
we're actually for the more energy to

we're actually for the more energy to
 

02:47:14.000 --> 02:47:16.960
we're actually for the more energy to
say the more you actually use you know

02:47:16.960 --> 02:47:16.970
say the more you actually use you know
 

02:47:16.970 --> 02:47:18.700
say the more you actually use you know
we're doing more efficiency whatever

02:47:18.700 --> 02:47:18.710
we're doing more efficiency whatever
 

02:47:18.710 --> 02:47:21.550
we're doing more efficiency whatever
that you're just consuming more up and

02:47:21.550 --> 02:47:21.560
that you're just consuming more up and
 

02:47:21.560 --> 02:47:23.770
that you're just consuming more up and
so we're producing more and more and

02:47:23.770 --> 02:47:23.780
so we're producing more and more and
 

02:47:23.780 --> 02:47:26.590
so we're producing more and more and
more so you're pointing out the

02:47:26.590 --> 02:47:26.600
more so you're pointing out the
 

02:47:26.600 --> 02:47:28.900
more so you're pointing out the
underpinnings of how the economy works

02:47:28.900 --> 02:47:28.910
underpinnings of how the economy works
 

02:47:28.910 --> 02:47:32.170
underpinnings of how the economy works
and how we view our economies and one of

02:47:32.170 --> 02:47:32.180
and how we view our economies and one of
 

02:47:32.180 --> 02:47:33.400
and how we view our economies and one of
the one of the things we were talking

02:47:33.400 --> 02:47:33.410
the one of the things we were talking
 

02:47:33.410 --> 02:47:36.580
the one of the things we were talking
about last week was gross domestic gross

02:47:36.580 --> 02:47:36.590
about last week was gross domestic gross
 

02:47:36.590 --> 02:47:38.200
about last week was gross domestic gross
domestic product and I'm just wondering

02:47:38.200 --> 02:47:38.210
domestic product and I'm just wondering
 

02:47:38.210 --> 02:47:40.510
domestic product and I'm just wondering
you know in this age where we have all

02:47:40.510 --> 02:47:40.520
you know in this age where we have all
 

02:47:40.520 --> 02:47:43.060
you know in this age where we have all
these nations are being measured by

02:47:43.060 --> 02:47:43.070
these nations are being measured by
 

02:47:43.070 --> 02:47:46.840
these nations are being measured by
their GDP and their growth and profit

02:47:46.840 --> 02:47:46.850
their GDP and their growth and profit
 

02:47:46.850 --> 02:47:50.410
their GDP and their growth and profit
and how much that the witness system or

02:47:50.410 --> 02:47:50.420
and how much that the witness system or
 

02:47:50.420 --> 02:47:53.590
and how much that the witness system or
the models that we use to measure is

02:47:53.590 --> 02:47:53.600
the models that we use to measure is
 

02:47:53.600 --> 02:47:57.750
the models that we use to measure is
actually fueling the increase in

02:47:57.750 --> 02:47:57.760
actually fueling the increase in
 

02:47:57.760 --> 02:47:59.309
actually fueling the increase in
kinds of the consumption that we see

02:47:59.309 --> 02:47:59.319
kinds of the consumption that we see
 

02:47:59.319 --> 02:48:01.590
kinds of the consumption that we see
this increase in the amount of ways so

02:48:01.590 --> 02:48:01.600
this increase in the amount of ways so
 

02:48:01.600 --> 02:48:04.110
this increase in the amount of ways so
I'm wondering and that question came up

02:48:04.110 --> 02:48:04.120
I'm wondering and that question came up
 

02:48:04.120 --> 02:48:07.469
I'm wondering and that question came up
are there other models of how we view

02:48:07.469 --> 02:48:07.479
are there other models of how we view
 

02:48:07.479 --> 02:48:10.250
are there other models of how we view
this data or how we look at economy

02:48:10.250 --> 02:48:10.260
this data or how we look at economy
 

02:48:10.260 --> 02:48:13.260
this data or how we look at economy
economies that would lend themselves

02:48:13.260 --> 02:48:13.270
economies that would lend themselves
 

02:48:13.270 --> 02:48:21.830
economies that would lend themselves
more to reduction of consumption waste

02:48:21.830 --> 02:48:21.840
 
 

02:48:21.840 --> 02:48:24.120
 
because it seems like some of this stuff

02:48:24.120 --> 02:48:24.130
because it seems like some of this stuff
 

02:48:24.130 --> 02:48:27.690
because it seems like some of this stuff
that you're modeling like coming up with

02:48:27.690 --> 02:48:27.700
that you're modeling like coming up with
 

02:48:27.700 --> 02:48:30.240
that you're modeling like coming up with
different ways of measuring you know it

02:48:30.240 --> 02:48:30.250
different ways of measuring you know it
 

02:48:30.250 --> 02:48:34.170
different ways of measuring you know it
seems like that can start to get at what

02:48:34.170 --> 02:48:34.180
seems like that can start to get at what
 

02:48:34.180 --> 02:48:35.400
seems like that can start to get at what
this question is I mean there are people

02:48:35.400 --> 02:48:35.410
this question is I mean there are people
 

02:48:35.410 --> 02:48:37.230
this question is I mean there are people
now measuring gross domestic happiness

02:48:37.230 --> 02:48:37.240
now measuring gross domestic happiness
 

02:48:37.240 --> 02:48:39.630
now measuring gross domestic happiness
and you know these kinds of questions

02:48:39.630 --> 02:48:39.640
and you know these kinds of questions
 

02:48:39.640 --> 02:48:44.730
and you know these kinds of questions
and the cracks me up because people talk

02:48:44.730 --> 02:48:44.740
and the cracks me up because people talk
 

02:48:44.740 --> 02:48:46.559
and the cracks me up because people talk
about measuring gross domestic happiness

02:48:46.559 --> 02:48:46.569
about measuring gross domestic happiness
 

02:48:46.569 --> 02:48:50.000
about measuring gross domestic happiness
and the one country that does that is

02:48:50.000 --> 02:48:50.010
and the one country that does that is
 

02:48:50.010 --> 02:48:54.900
and the one country that does that is
bhutan and it's a monarchy everybody's

02:48:54.900 --> 02:48:54.910
bhutan and it's a monarchy everybody's
 

02:48:54.910 --> 02:49:02.309
bhutan and it's a monarchy everybody's
really happy but anyway so the yeah I

02:49:02.309 --> 02:49:02.319
really happy but anyway so the yeah I
 

02:49:02.319 --> 02:49:04.349
really happy but anyway so the yeah I
mean there's so many ways to measure it

02:49:04.349 --> 02:49:04.359
mean there's so many ways to measure it
 

02:49:04.359 --> 02:49:07.130
mean there's so many ways to measure it
and GDP is a very narrow and misleading

02:49:07.130 --> 02:49:07.140
and GDP is a very narrow and misleading
 

02:49:07.140 --> 02:49:09.960
and GDP is a very narrow and misleading
measurement for a lot of people and it's

measurement for a lot of people and it's
 

02:49:09.970 --> 02:49:15.000
measurement for a lot of people and it's
it's very specific and very accurate for

it's very specific and very accurate for
 

02:49:15.010 --> 02:49:19.940
it's very specific and very accurate for
measuring as a measurement for

02:49:19.950 --> 02:49:22.559
 
corporations and you know the kind of

02:49:22.559 --> 02:49:22.569
corporations and you know the kind of
 

02:49:22.569 --> 02:49:28.200
corporations and you know the kind of
neoliberal economics that have

02:49:28.200 --> 02:49:28.210
 
 

02:49:28.210 --> 02:49:33.570

prevailed in recent decades but you know
 

02:49:33.580 --> 02:49:38.520
prevailed in recent decades but you know
there this is part of what we need to

02:49:38.520 --> 02:49:38.530
there this is part of what we need to
 

02:49:38.530 --> 02:49:39.870
there this is part of what we need to
remake and it's something that the

02:49:39.870 --> 02:49:39.880
remake and it's something that the
 

02:49:39.880 --> 02:49:42.750
remake and it's something that the
people in gabon are remaking which is

a lot and like you know the question of
 

02:50:15.460 --> 02:50:18.240
a lot and like you know the question of
choice when you tell people that we need

02:50:18.240 --> 02:50:18.250
choice when you tell people that we need
 

02:50:18.250 --> 02:50:20.910
choice when you tell people that we need
to consume less because we do that's how

02:50:20.910 --> 02:50:20.920
to consume less because we do that's how
 

02:50:20.920 --> 02:50:22.860
to consume less because we do that's how
that's how we're going to cut our co2

02:50:22.860 --> 02:50:22.870
that's how we're going to cut our co2
 

02:50:22.870 --> 02:50:26.070
that's how we're going to cut our co2
emissions that's how we're going to you

social and environmental impacts that is
 

02:50:37.740 --> 02:50:42.210
social and environmental impacts that is
you know we need to produce less co2 we

02:50:42.210 --> 02:50:42.220
you know we need to produce less co2 we
 

02:50:42.220 --> 02:50:43.980
you know we need to produce less co2 we
need to Falu bucks we need to produce

02:50:43.980 --> 02:50:43.990
need to Falu bucks we need to produce
 

02:50:43.990 --> 02:50:46.620
need to Falu bucks we need to produce
less garbage and it's not something that

02:50:46.620 --> 02:50:46.630
less garbage and it's not something that
 

02:50:46.630 --> 02:50:48.350
less garbage and it's not something that
we are just going to do as individuals

02:50:48.350 --> 02:50:48.360
we are just going to do as individuals
 

02:50:48.360 --> 02:50:50.940
we are just going to do as individuals
because we need to have those choices

02:50:50.940 --> 02:50:50.950
because we need to have those choices
 

02:50:50.950 --> 02:50:53.100
because we need to have those choices
and we don't have those choices right

02:50:53.100 --> 02:50:53.110
and we don't have those choices right
 

02:50:53.110 --> 02:50:54.660
and we don't have those choices right
now we don't have enough of those

02:50:54.660 --> 02:50:54.670
now we don't have enough of those
 

02:50:54.670 --> 02:50:58.890
now we don't have enough of those
choices and when when I say that I often

02:50:58.890 --> 02:50:58.900
choices and when when I say that I often
 

02:50:58.900 --> 02:51:01.110
choices and when when I say that I often
hear you know this kind of response that

02:51:01.110 --> 02:51:01.120
hear you know this kind of response that
 

02:51:01.120 --> 02:51:03.780
hear you know this kind of response that
well you know if you if you tell us that

02:51:03.780 --> 02:51:03.790
well you know if you if you tell us that
 

02:51:03.790 --> 02:51:07.530
well you know if you if you tell us that
we can't consume as much

02:51:07.530 --> 02:51:07.540
 
 

02:51:07.540 --> 02:51:09.990
 
we're going to suffer our comfort level

02:51:09.990 --> 02:51:10.000
we're going to suffer our comfort level
 

02:51:10.000 --> 02:51:12.900
we're going to suffer our comfort level
will go down and our standard of living

02:51:12.900 --> 02:51:12.910
will go down and our standard of living
 

02:51:12.910 --> 02:51:16.320
will go down and our standard of living
will go down and and one thing that I

02:51:16.320 --> 02:51:16.330
will go down and and one thing that I
 

02:51:16.330 --> 02:51:18.480
will go down and and one thing that I
noticed in doing a different research

02:51:18.480 --> 02:51:18.490
noticed in doing a different research
 

02:51:18.490 --> 02:51:19.950
noticed in doing a different research
that I've done is that you know if you

02:51:19.950 --> 02:51:19.960
that I've done is that you know if you
 

02:51:19.960 --> 02:51:23.120
that I've done is that you know if you
look at the choices that we have now

02:51:23.120 --> 02:51:23.130
look at the choices that we have now
 

02:51:23.130 --> 02:51:26.100
look at the choices that we have now
under you know the kind of free choice

02:51:26.100 --> 02:51:26.110
under you know the kind of free choice
 

02:51:26.110 --> 02:51:28.470
under you know the kind of free choice
that that we're supposed to be getting

02:51:28.470 --> 02:51:28.480
that that we're supposed to be getting
 

02:51:28.480 --> 02:51:30.990
that that we're supposed to be getting
is you know something like ninety

02:51:30.990 --> 02:51:31.000
is you know something like ninety
 

02:51:31.000 --> 02:51:33.500
is you know something like ninety
percent of the food we eat contains corn

02:51:33.500 --> 02:51:33.510
percent of the food we eat contains corn
 

02:51:33.510 --> 02:51:36.630
percent of the food we eat contains corn
that's a massive elimination of choice

02:51:36.630 --> 02:51:36.640
that's a massive elimination of choice
 

02:51:36.640 --> 02:51:42.120
that's a massive elimination of choice
you know the the dying species on the

02:51:42.120 --> 02:51:42.130
you know the the dying species on the
 

02:51:42.130 --> 02:51:44.340
you know the the dying species on the
planet are a massive elimination of

02:51:44.340 --> 02:51:44.350
planet are a massive elimination of
 

02:51:44.350 --> 02:51:46.500
planet are a massive elimination of
choice if you could you know define it

02:51:46.500 --> 02:51:46.510
choice if you could you know define it
 

02:51:46.510 --> 02:51:49.740
choice if you could you know define it
in different ways so there's a there's a

02:51:49.740 --> 02:51:49.750
in different ways so there's a there's a
 

02:51:49.750 --> 02:51:53.190
in different ways so there's a there's a
huge elimination of choice that is the

02:51:53.190 --> 02:51:53.200
huge elimination of choice that is the
 

02:51:53.200 --> 02:51:57.720
huge elimination of choice that is the
result of measuring you know GDP and
