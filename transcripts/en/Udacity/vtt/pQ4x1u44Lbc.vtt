00:00:13.547 --> 00:00:17.027
Containers, microservices, kubernetes.

00:00:17.027 --> 00:00:20.240
These are a few of the hottest
buzzwords floating around.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.300
But what's driving the hype?

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.440
In the last decade, user demand for

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.770
always on applications
have grown exponentially.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.040
If you go to your favorite site,

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.670
you expect, no,
demand it to be up 24/7 globally.

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:34.370
No exceptions.

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.830
Many developers have chosen application
patterns such as microservices,

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:40.300
to meet this need.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.710
But what about the infrastructure
to support these always on apps?

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.830
This course is going to show you,
step by step, from theory to production,

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.180
how to meet these demands using
tools that are available today.

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.070
I'm your host, Carter Morgan.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.700
And like you, I'm new to this
world of microservices and

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.750
the advanced infrastructures
used to support that.

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:01.670
So I reached out to my good friend,
Kelsey Hightower.

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.030
You may know him as Mr. Kubernetes,
AKA, a sys admin who can code.

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:08.920
Kelsey will be serving
as our industry expert,

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.900
giving us deep insights into
the solutions we'll be covering.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.110
Additionally, we'll be hearing from
the legendary former cloud architect of

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:16.940
Netflix.

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.670
The guy who helped make microservices
mainstream, Adrian Cockcroft.

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.670
And he will be sharing his insights
on the evolution of applications

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:25.890
in modern day infrastructure.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.540
But before we go any further, let's hear
from Kelsey on who this course is for.

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.390
&gt;&gt; You know Carter, this course is for
anyone doing operations.

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.830
Whether you're sys admin, or
developer, or anyone new to the field,

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.779
looking to mystify the idea of
managing applications at scale.

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.520
Many of you may be familiar with
automation tools such as Puppet,

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.380
Chef, or Ansible.

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.960
We're going to build on that knowledge,
and introduce you to the world of

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.190
distributed systems, and take your
idea of automation to the next level.

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:56.700
&gt;&gt; This will be taught through
a collection of hands on tasks,

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.511
using industry standard tooling
like Docker and Kubernetes.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.090
By the end of this course,

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.270
you'll know the ins and
outs of the cloud application Lifecycle,

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.250
from packaging it into a container,
to managing into production.

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.750
Kelsey, I know a lot of people
are excited about this, but

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.588
can you give a sneak peek
about what to expect.

00:02:14.588 --> 00:02:19.170
&gt;&gt; First, we're going to start with
the basics of understanding modern day

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.840
applications, and how a new design
pattern such as microservices,

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.080
has driven the need for
more robust infrastructure.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.610
Once we have a solid
understanding of an application,

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.860
we'll shift focus towards
how to package and

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.420
distribute our apps, using the Docker
image format and container technologies.

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.700
Then we'll really up our game, to
running applications using distributed

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.200
platform that allows us to start small,
and

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.890
scale to the levels of internet giants
such as Google, Facebook, and Netflix.

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:46.630
&gt;&gt; Where do I sign up?

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.240
I don't know about you, but
that's exactly what I'm looking for.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.054
Let's go ahead and
get started, shall we?

00:02:52.054 --> 00:03:02.054
