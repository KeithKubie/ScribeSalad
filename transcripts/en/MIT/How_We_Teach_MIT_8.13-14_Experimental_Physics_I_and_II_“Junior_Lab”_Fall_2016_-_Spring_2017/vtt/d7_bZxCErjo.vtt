SAARIK KALIA: OK.

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:12.170
Hi.

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:13.990
So my name is
Saarik, and I'm going

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.050
to be talking today about how
we can use the 21 centimeter

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.140
hydrogen line to determine
the galactic rotation

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.520
curve and some of the structure
of the Milky Way galaxy.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.370
So first off, why do we care
about galactic rotation curves?

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:30.490
So basically rotation speed
can tell us about mass.

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:32.800
We know this from simple
Newtonian mechanics.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.800
If you have a planet
going around a sun,

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.090
then its velocity is given by
this equation, where M here

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.320
is the mass of the sun.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.561
In our case, since we're
working with a galaxy,

00:00:43.561 --> 00:00:44.560
we have spread out mass.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.143
This M is actually
going to correspond

00:00:46.143 --> 00:00:49.310
to basically the mass
contained within the orbit.

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:57.130
So using a formula like this,
given the mass distribution

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:58.660
that we see in the
Milky Way galaxy,

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.370
we can guess what
kinds of velocities

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.370
we should see various
things rotating at.

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.700
And we can plot that and we get
a curve that looks like this.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.850
But we actually,
as we'll see later

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.810
when we go ahead and observe
what velocities stars are

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.170
really moving at, we'll
actually see a huge discrepancy

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.450
between what we would expect
from the visible matter

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:20.490
that we can see.

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.070
And basically the way that we
might be able to explain this

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.070
is possibly there is matter out
there that we just can't see.

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.460
And physicists term this
matter as dark matter.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.930
So what we're going to be
working on in this experiment

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:41.380
is trying to be able to actually
plot this rotation curve.

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.710
And in being able to
show these discrepancies,

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.280
this will motivate new physics.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.390
So how are we going to
find this rotation curve?

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.850
So the way we're
going to be looking

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.470
at the velocities
of various stars

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.884
is using the Doppler effect.

00:01:59.884 --> 00:02:02.050
In our case, this will be
a non-relativistic Doppler

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.550
effect.

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:04.360
This is simply
just, as an object

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.280
is moving towards
you, the frequencies

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.257
that it emits are
slightly higher than if it

00:02:09.257 --> 00:02:10.090
were standing still.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.679
So we can look out at the stars.

00:02:16.679 --> 00:02:18.220
But looking for
optical light doesn't

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.260
work too well because
it suffers absorption

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.880
from other stars or
interstellar gas and dust.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.700
So instead we prefer something
in a slightly lower frequency

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.320
range around the
radio emission range.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.240
Luckily for us,
hydrogen actually

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.690
exhibits an emission
in this lower frequency

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:43.020
range, particularly, yeah,
at this 21 centimeter line.

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.850
And this occurs as
spin flip transition.

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.660
So when the proton
and electron go

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.460
from being aligned
to anti-aligned,

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.550
that's a slightly
lower energy state,

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.300
and so it releases a
little bit of energy.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.390
And we can look at that
energy coming from the sky.

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.000
And by seeing how
that frequency shifts,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.490
we can deduce the
velocity that the emitter

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:05.800
must have been moving at.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.300
So this is the
apparatus we're going

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:12.700
to be using for detecting
our various emissions.

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.120
The actual telescope
itself is a parabolic dish,

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.820
which takes an incoming
light, reflects it

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.450
onto this feed horn,
and the net signal

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.080
is fed into this
fairly complex circuit.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.170
I'll just point out
some important things.

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.900
The signal comes in,
it gets amplified,

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.160
goes to the bandpass filter.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.451
That's just to get rid of
any frequencies we absolutely

00:03:35.451 --> 00:03:36.427
don't care about.

00:03:36.427 --> 00:03:38.260
And then one important
point is that it goes

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.600
to this image rejection mixer.

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.290
And what that does is it
multiplies the incoming signal

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:50.150
by a signal that we manually
put in of 1420.4 megahertz.

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.430
That's the frequency of
the 21 centimeter line

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:54.830
that we're looking for.

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:58.390
And as you can see from
this trigonometric formula,

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.910
multiplying two
signals is actually

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.090
equivalent to just producing
one signal whose frequency is

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.040
the sum and one
who's the difference.

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.170
And by using the
second bandpass filter,

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:09.880
we can eliminate
the sum and just

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.250
be left with this signal,
which is the difference.

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:13.750
And so the reason
we do this is just

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.959
to get a very precise
measurement of how

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.620
off the signal we're seeing
is from the 21 centimeter line

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.420
we would expect from
a still observer.

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:26.890
And using that we can figure
out what velocity the emitter

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:29.500
is moving at.

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:35.720
OK, and so in order to
turn this into temperatures

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.697
is what we'll be dealing with.

00:04:37.697 --> 00:04:39.280
We're going to first
have to calibrate

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.110
this with a noise diode.

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:45.360
What this will do is just
send a signal to the feed horn

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.580
that looks like 115
Kelvin blackbody all

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.330
throughout the sky.

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:55.330
And so it uses the signal it
sees from this to extrapolate

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.460
other signals that it will see.

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.770
So basically, if
later on it sees

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:02.170
a signal that's twice as
strong as the signal that's

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:05.170
on its calibration, at some
specific frequency then

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:08.110
it says, oh, there must
be a 230 Kelvin blackbody

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:09.790
at that specific frequency.

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:11.730
So at the end we'll
be getting some sort

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:16.340
of temperature profile as
a function of frequency.

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.450
And we're going to be
taking measurements

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:20.820
all across the galaxy.

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:24.990
Essentially, our galaxy is
mostly shaped in a planar disk,

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:28.950
so we'll be just looking
within that disk.

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:31.530
The galaxy has some central
bulge with some spiral

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:33.180
arms coming out of it.

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.310
And our sun is
located down here.

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:39.660
We will be sweeping from the
galactic longitude of zero,

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:42.120
which is directed towards
the center of the galaxy,

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:45.320
out to 180, which is
directed away from it,

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:48.110
so we'll be looking at the
first and second quadrants.

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:50.640
As we'll talk about later, these
first quadrant measurements

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:52.920
will be used to determine
the rotation curve

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:55.350
and the second
quadrant measurements

00:05:55.350 --> 00:06:01.030
will be used to determine
the structures of the galaxy.

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:07.110
OK, so as we mentioned
before, given a frequency,

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:09.870
we can turn that into a
velocity using our Doppler

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:12.600
shift via this formula.

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.016
This 120.

00:06:14.016 --> 00:06:20.250
4-- or 1420.4 megahertz is just
the emission, the frequency

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:22.320
of the 21 centimeter line.

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:24.180
This right here is just
the speed of light.

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:25.800
And then we have this VLSR.

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:29.370
This is just our velocity
with respect to the sun

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:30.960
just to factor
out any revolution

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:32.300
that we have around the sun.

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:35.160
So this V observed is actually
the velocity with respect

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:39.010
to the sun, not with respect us.

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:44.820
And so now we can use this
velocity using various trig

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:46.920
formulas, Law of Sines.

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:51.330
We can relate the velocity we
observed to the actual velocity

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:57.760
of the star in question.

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:00.570
And note here we have to
use this critical assumption

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:03.450
that the stars move in
circular orbits, which

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:06.840
is fairly close to accurate.

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:08.700
But using this
assumption allows us

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:11.400
to say that the
velocity of this star

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.190
is at a right angle
with its radius.

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:18.120
And then if we know the
radius at which the star lies,

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:23.010
then we can use this formula
to relate the velocity we see

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:25.920
with the velocity of the star.

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:28.080
And here we're going to
be taking R naught, which

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:30.420
is the distance from us
to the center of the sun,

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:33.090
to be a 8.5 kiloparsecs
and theta naught,

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:37.980
which is our speed
within the galaxy,

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:40.570
to be 220 kilometers per second.

00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:43.950
These numbers are
not too well known,

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:45.817
but these will be the
values we'll be using.

00:07:45.817 --> 00:07:47.400
And the literature
will compare again,

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:48.816
so we'll be using
the same values.

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.340
Right, and so this formula
is all well and good

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:56.514
if we actually know what
radius this star is at.

00:07:56.514 --> 00:07:57.930
But, a priori, we
don't know that.

00:07:57.930 --> 00:07:59.820
So the trick we're
going to be using here

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:03.200
is actually just to consider the
maximum velocity that we see.

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:06.990
And the maximum velocity will
occur at the minimum radius.

00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:10.510
And that's simply given
by this R naught sine L.

00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:14.670
And so if we specifically
consider that minimum radius,

00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:17.670
then this formula allows us to
relate that maximum velocity

00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:20.010
to the velocity of
the star in question.

00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:21.720
Note, however, that
this only works

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:24.787
for longitudes less than 90.

00:08:24.787 --> 00:08:27.120
That's in the first quadrant
I was talking about before.

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:29.340
And that's simply
because, if you're

00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:31.680
looking at stars
which are further

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:34.518
away from the center
of the galaxy, then

00:08:34.518 --> 00:08:36.809
they're all just going to
get further and further away.

00:08:36.809 --> 00:08:41.070
There's not going to
be any minimum radius.

00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:45.690
Right, so we wanted to determine
this maximum velocity that's

00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:48.220
equivalent to determining
a minimum frequency.

00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:51.060
So how are we actually going
to get that minimum frequency?

00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:55.020
So as we said before, we have
this temperature spectrum

00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:56.370
as a function of frequency.

00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:58.680
We're going to start off
by trimming off the edges.

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:00.541
There's just a
very quick falloff

00:09:00.541 --> 00:09:02.040
just from the
bandpass filter there,

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:04.350
so we have to get rid of those.

00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:08.330
And at each given longitude,
we take about 40 trials

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:14.920
and we average that into one
the temperature spectrum.

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:16.650
So this is what our
spectrum looks like.

00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:22.050
We're going to fit the first
few bins to a linear background.

00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:24.090
And we can see that the
background fit is quite

00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:26.670
good for these initial points.

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:29.490
You'll notice here we have
this annoying little peak here.

00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:32.410
This actually shows up
in most of our plots.

00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:34.920
This is probably because of
just some constant source

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:36.360
that's creating noise.

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:39.300
So when we fit this background,
we just ignore those points

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:40.470
in particular.

00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:44.760
But for the rest of the
points, the fit is quite good.

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:48.090
Then we're going to find
the first point, which

00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:51.607
exceeds this background by
some fixed amount one Kelvin.

00:09:51.607 --> 00:09:53.940
And we say that that is going
to be our minimum emission

00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:54.760
frequency.

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:59.550
So in this case, this
is 1420.4494 megahertz.

00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:02.160
And we can estimate the
error on this method

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:04.600
by basically fudging
this 35 number,

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:06.360
so see what happens
if we use the first 20

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:12.220
bins versus what happens when
we use the first 50 instead.

00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:14.680
And so the number
we get out of it

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:16.680
will shift a little bit
up or a little bit down.

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:20.640
In this case, it shifted one
bin up and two bins down.

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:24.390
And so that gives us an error
on what this kind of method

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:27.210
will give for a minimum
emission frequency.

00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:31.290
And by default, if shifting
around this 35 number

00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:32.790
doesn't change
anything, then we'll

00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:38.190
just say that the error is
just the bin with itself.

00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:38.690
Great.

00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:41.970
So using that minimum
mission frequency,

00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:44.870
we can find a velocity
as per the formulas

00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:46.510
I had a few slides ago.

00:10:46.510 --> 00:10:49.740
And we can also get
the radius simply

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:52.110
as a function of the
galactic longitude.

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:53.730
And we can plot it out.

00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:56.800
And we'll get a curve that
looks something like this.

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:58.830
So this red curve
that I'm plotting here

00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:02.760
is a curve I found in the
literature from a paper

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:03.750
by Clemens.

00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:09.184
He fit a piecewise polynomial
to his observed data,

00:11:09.184 --> 00:11:10.600
and so we're
comparing it to that.

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:16.290
We see actually that the
later values, the higher radii

00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:18.840
actually agree quite
well with the literature.

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:20.220
We see a little
more disagreement

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:21.810
with the lower values.

00:11:21.810 --> 00:11:24.520
This can be for
possibly a few reasons.

00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:28.986
One could be you might have
seen in that plot I had before

00:11:28.986 --> 00:11:33.779
that the temperature
starts to rise much slower,

00:11:33.779 --> 00:11:35.820
and so it's harder to find
an emission frequency.

00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:38.940
For these higher values,
there's a much sharper jump.

00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:42.960
Secondly, the actual
frequencies that you

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:46.860
need to move these
points up to this line

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:49.410
tend to be outside of
our frequency window

00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:53.030
or where that annoying
little noise was, so that's

00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:55.500
just somewhat of a
limitation of the apparatus.

00:11:55.500 --> 00:12:01.104
And then the third is the
circular orbit assumption.

00:12:01.104 --> 00:12:02.520
For smaller angles
this assumption

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:05.070
becomes more critical, and so
even a small shift in angle

00:12:05.070 --> 00:12:08.490
can make a much
bigger difference.

00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:11.850
So we see, if we look
just at the later points,

00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:18.720
we actually get a pretty
decent chi squared of 13.4.

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:22.290
So, yeah, this agrees fairly
well with the literature.

00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:24.210
So then there's one
more thing that we

00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:29.264
want to try to look at using
this 21 centimeter line,

00:12:29.264 --> 00:12:31.680
and that's going to be the
galactic structure of the Milky

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:32.430
Way.

00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:34.312
As we talked about
before, we know

00:12:34.312 --> 00:12:35.770
that the Milky Way
has spiral arms,

00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:38.103
so we're going to try to see
if we can look out and find

00:12:38.103 --> 00:12:41.770
those structures.

00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:44.280
So in order to do
this, we specifically

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:46.802
need to assume some sort
of galactic rotation curve,

00:12:46.802 --> 00:12:48.510
so we're going to be
working with the one

00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:50.550
that we found in Clemens.

00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:52.620
And using the
formulas before, we

00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:57.060
can use this given curve to
solve for a specific R given

00:12:57.060 --> 00:12:58.500
any observed velocity.

00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:03.360
So now we can associate
radii with all the velocities

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:05.280
that we see.

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:08.231
And, of course, this
is just the radius

00:13:08.231 --> 00:13:09.480
from the center of the galaxy.

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:12.030
What we actually want
is the distance from us

00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:13.800
in order to be
able to plot this,

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:18.580
so we can make that
quick change here.

00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:21.150
And now note that
this only really works

00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:24.330
for galactic longitudes
greater than 90.

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:26.790
Those are things in the
second quadrant simply

00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:29.010
because, if we look inwards
to the first quadrant,

00:13:29.010 --> 00:13:32.280
there are two
possible solutions.

00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:33.780
Along the same line
of sight you can

00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:36.930
find two different points
that have the same distance

00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:39.660
from the center.

00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:45.540
And again, we're going to fit
these to a linear background

00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:49.657
now with 25 initial
bins and 10 final bins.

00:13:49.657 --> 00:13:51.240
And we're going to
say the temperature

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:55.860
above the background
multiplied by the distance

00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:58.560
from us squared,
this is just because

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:01.496
of an inverse square
power law, we're

00:14:01.496 --> 00:14:03.870
going to say that that gives
us a relative measure of how

00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:09.150
much hydrogen must be there and,
as a result, how much emission

00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:10.540
that we're seeing.

00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:15.330
So we can use these methods
and plot out of a big plot

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:18.090
of what the second quadrant
of the Milky Way galaxy

00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:19.440
looks like.

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:24.120
So you can see here, there are
two spiral arms we can see,

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:28.710
one much closer to us and then
one forming out around here.

00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:32.970
Those actually correspond fairly
well with this Perseus arm here

00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:35.820
and then the outer
arm further out here.

00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:39.760
You might notice that, as we
get up to higher longitudes,

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:41.460
the points start
to become larger.

00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:45.900
Here the points denote
the strength, yeah,

00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:47.700
the relative amount
of hydrogen that we

00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:51.600
would see in a region
out there based

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:54.900
on the temperature
of the background.

00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:58.050
And so you might see
here that, as we get out

00:14:58.050 --> 00:15:01.620
to higher longitudes, we start
to see it blow up a little bit.

00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:06.820
We don't believe that this
is a physical consequence,

00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:08.130
that this is actually physical.

00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:11.250
This is more just a
limitation of the apparatus.

00:15:11.250 --> 00:15:14.190
So in conclusion, we were
able to use this 21 centimeter

00:15:14.190 --> 00:15:18.414
technique to derive the
rotation curve of the Milky Way,

00:15:18.414 --> 00:15:20.580
and we saw pretty good
agreement with the literature

00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:23.640
for large radii.

00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:26.880
In particular, we saw there was
a constant velocity function

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:30.600
as we went out to
higher radii, and that

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:32.890
disagrees with the
theoretical prediction.

00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:35.310
And so this really
necessitates some sort

00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:39.450
of dark matter, which can
compensate for the discrepancy.

00:15:39.450 --> 00:15:42.330
We were also able to see some
of the Milky Way structure

00:15:42.330 --> 00:15:45.450
by looking at the
exterior points.

00:15:45.450 --> 00:15:47.820
And in particular, we
saw two spiral arms

00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:50.910
in that second quadrant.

00:15:50.910 --> 00:15:53.735
And finally I would like to
thank my partner, Toby, for all

00:15:53.735 --> 00:15:55.110
his help throughout
this semester

00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:57.900
and on this particular
experiment, some last minute

00:15:57.900 --> 00:15:59.900
data collection.

00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:03.150
I'd like to thank the 8.13
staff for all their help

00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:05.400
throughout and
instruction and then MIT

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:07.381
for offering this course.

00:16:07.381 --> 00:16:07.881
OK.

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:17.324
PROFESSOR: Questions?

00:16:20.803 --> 00:16:21.619
SAARIK KALIA: Yeah?

00:16:21.619 --> 00:16:23.785
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
that you fit your background

00:16:23.785 --> 00:16:24.773
to a linear fit.

00:16:24.773 --> 00:16:25.773
SAARIK KALIA: All right.

00:16:25.773 --> 00:16:27.761
AUDIENCE: Why do you
expect the background

00:16:27.761 --> 00:16:29.749
to go up as you go in frequency?

00:16:29.749 --> 00:16:31.737
It seems like, at
least [INAUDIBLE],,

00:16:31.737 --> 00:16:36.230
it would just stay constant
across all the planes.

00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:41.312
SAARIK KALIA: So I think this
is essentially because of the--

00:16:41.312 --> 00:16:45.140
you would expect the temperature
that you see from a blackbody

00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:51.160
to go like Planck's Law
or his formula, right,

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:53.132
the blackbody spectrum formula.

00:16:53.132 --> 00:16:54.590
But essentially
what we're doing is

00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:58.070
we're zooming in on a very,
very small part of that,

00:16:58.070 --> 00:17:00.200
specifically around
one frequency.

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:02.539
And so in that
region, it's linear.

00:17:02.539 --> 00:17:03.080
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:04.220
SAARIK KALIA: So this
is why we're expecting

00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:05.349
some sort of linear background.

00:17:05.349 --> 00:17:05.890
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:17:09.285 --> 00:17:10.761
PROFESSOR: Good questions?

00:17:14.210 --> 00:17:15.889
SAARIK KALIA: Yeah.

00:17:15.889 --> 00:17:18.545
AUDIENCE: What uncertainty do
you find in your temperature

00:17:18.545 --> 00:17:19.270
counts?

00:17:23.134 --> 00:17:27.000
Or is there uncertainty?

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:32.890
SAARIK KALIA: So for the
rotation curve, the uncertainty

00:17:32.890 --> 00:17:33.390
in the--

00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:36.300
I mean, yeah, I guess there
should be some like Poisson

00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:38.340
uncertainty in the
temperature counts.

00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:39.960
For the rotation
curve, that's not

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:41.370
as important
because what we care

00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:46.030
about is the frequency
at which it occurs.

00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:49.420
I guess for the
galactic structure,

00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:52.060
you really could put
some uncertainty on that

00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:56.020
and it would just be squared
of n Poisson uncertainty.

00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:00.820
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:02.620
And no other questions?

00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:04.770
Thank the speaker again.
