00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.009
Welcome back.

00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:05.580
I will now introduce you to the
concept of-- well, I've

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.130
introduced what vectors are, but
I'll introduce you to how

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.970
they can be even more useful and
we're going to use that to

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:14.350
actually solve 2-dimensional
projectile motion problems.

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:16.470
Now we can introduce the game
where you just don't throw the

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.850
ball straight up, you can see
how far you can throw the ball

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:21.870
or what's the optimal angle
to throw the ball at.

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:25.220
So hopefully, you'll find this
even more fun, if you can

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.050
imagine it, then the

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.430
1-dimensional projectile motion.

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.450
So everything we've been doing
so far, hopefully, you have an

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.150
intuition that the difference
between a vector and a scalar

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.740
is that a vector
has direction.

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:47.270
So a vector has-- let me do
colon instead-- has magnitude

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:48.520
and direction.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.805
While a scalar has
only magnitude.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.020
An example of a vector,
velocity is a vector.

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.060
That's easy.

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.820
Maybe we'll start with v, but
velocity is a vector.

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.490
Well in those examples we were
doing before, we said that the

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.640
ball was going-- sometimes we
said that the final velocity

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.360
was minus 30 meters
per second.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.530
And so where was the magnitude
and what was the direction?

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.590
Well, the magnitude was 30.

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.650
And the direction was-- I knew
what the direction was by the

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.500
sign of that minus sign.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.960
In that same problem, if someone
asked me, what is the

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.610
speed of the ball right before
it hits the ground?

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.240
I would've said oh, the speed is
just 30 meters per second.

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.660
And I wouldn't have to say 30
meters per second down or

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:53.920
minus 30 per second.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.230
I'd just say 30 meters
per second

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:56.310
because that's its speed.

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.250
I don't know what direction
it's going in that speed.

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:59.370
So that's its speed.

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:04.990
And in a general way, in one
dimension, you could say that

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:10.350
the scalar of the same quantity
tends to be the

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:16.260
absolute value of the
vector quantity.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.420
Because in this example the
speed is just the absolute

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.570
value of this.

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.640
If my initial velocity was
plus-- that's not equal,

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.070
that's actually just equal.

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.810
If the initial velocity was
plus 30 meters per second,

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.610
then the speed would still
be 30 meters per second.

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.350
So I just wanted to introduce
that notion.

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:40.470
And in one dimension, velocity
can kind of be-- direction can

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.380
be implied by positive
or negative numbers.

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.720
But now, when we go into two
dimensions, we're going to

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.050
have to get a little bit more
sophisticated in terms of how

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.650
we give direction.

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.110
So let me clear this.

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.510
Let me give an example
where I take a ball.

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:10.630
I take a green ball, clearly a
green ball, and I throw it--

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.670
this is a straight line.

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:19.280
I throw it at 10 meters per
second, but I don't throw it

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.965
straight up.

00:03:19.965 --> 00:03:25.600
I actually throw it at a-- let
me think of a good angle.

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.960
I throw it at a--
I don't know.

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.110
I throw it at a 45
degree angle.

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:32.590
Or if you like, radians,
that's what?

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.220
So that's pi, pi over 4.

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.770
Let's say I throw it at
a 45 degree angle.

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:41.300
So now my problem becomes
a lot more complicated.

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.400
One, how do I specify the
magnitude and direction?

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.840
And then, how do I solve
this problem?

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.520
How do I figure out how high
it goes, how far it goes.

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:51.480
et cetera.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.400
And hopefully, that's what we
will be able to teach you over

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.730
the course of the next
couple of videos.

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.310
This is the ground, right?

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.730
So one, if I just want to give
the speed and direction, or

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.030
the magnitude and the direction
for this vector

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.210
quantity, I have just
specified it.

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:13.820
You know, I could to say my
velocity or my initial

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:22.610
velocity is 10 meters per second
at 45 degrees to the

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.000
horizon or something
like that.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.560
So that would be a legitimate
velocity specification.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.810
But it's kind of hard to deal
with, so what I'm going to

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.740
teach you is something very
neat about vectors.

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:38.410
Is that you can actually break
up a vector into-- I don't

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:40.670
want to introduce two
complicated terms, but into

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:42.550
its orthogonal components.

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.890
So you can say well, something
moving at 10 meters per second

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:55.300
at this angle, is actually
moving at some speed upwards

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:59.950
and it's moving at some speed,
in this case, to the right.

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:02.100
Let's say in the positive
direction.

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:05.400
So if you imagine this
coordinate axis, it's moving

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:10.780
in the y direction at some speed
and it's moving in the x

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:12.430
direction at some speed.

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:17.110
And when they're combined at
some way, you get this angle

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:19.590
or you're moving at kind
of an incline.

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:23.290
So how do I figure out-- if I
have 10 meters per second and

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:27.340
I'm moving-- how do I break
that down into my vertical

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:30.720
speed and my horizontal speed?

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.750
And I'll show you that it's
actually pretty cool.

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.325
It's pretty straightforward.

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:41.410
What you can do is you can
actually draw a vector where

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:46.700
the length of the vector
is its magnitude.

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:48.510
Let's draw it again.

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:50.680
So let's say this is a
coordinate axis and that the

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.700
length of this line
right here is 10.

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:58.200
The length of the this line is
10 and it represents speed or

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:00.280
velocity at this point.

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:04.640
And we know this angle
is 45 degrees.

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:11.110
So it turns out that the
vertical component of the

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:15.800
ball's velocity would be
equivalent to the length of

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:19.870
this side, and the horizontal
component would be equivalent

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:21.120
to the length of this side.

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:28.010
This arrow right here is the
same thing as this arrow, I

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:30.130
just translated it
to the right.

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:33.440
Just so that you see that
it's just a triangle.

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:35.030
And it's just not any triangle,

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:38.060
it's a right triangle.

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:41.680
And what's useful-- I don't want
to get too complicated

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:42.530
with linear algebra.

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:44.790
But it's important that the
two directions that you're

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:48.380
breaking it up in are-- well,
they don't have to be, but it

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:50.720
makes it useful that they are at
right angles to each other

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.410
because then we can start to use
a lot of our trig ratios.

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:55.360
So let's just figure
out this problem.

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:56.840
I think you just need to
see a lot of example.

00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:00.840
So we're going 10 meters per
second at 45 degrees.

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:05.150
Well, what speed am I going
straight up then?

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:08.060
What is the straight up
component of this 10 meters

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:09.390
per second?

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:11.570
Well, how do we figure out this
side if this was just a

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:13.720
regular triangle?

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:15.270
If this is the hypotenuse,
this is

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:17.610
opposite and this is adjacent.

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:21.366
So let me break out
some trigonometry.

00:07:21.366 --> 00:07:23.430
soh cah toa.

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:25.430
And if you don't remember your
trig or you never learned

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:29.330
trig, I encourage you to go
watch the trig videos that we

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:32.320
have. soh cah toa.

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:36.900
Which of the trig ratios involve
the opposite and the

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:38.150
hypotenuse?

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:42.780
So our sine.

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:48.630
And we know that sine of theta
is equal to opposite over

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:49.820
hypotenuse.

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:57.720
So we know that the sine of 45
degrees is equal to-- let's

00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:04.410
call this my velocity
of vertical.

00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:06.370
I've never seen that variable
used in actual physics

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:08.030
classes, but I think
it makes sense.

00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:11.890
This is the velocity vertical
and this is the velocity

00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:12.920
horizontal.

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:16.830
And later I'll introduce more
conventional conventions, but

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:18.010
that'll do us for now.

00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:21.810
So my vertical velocity, the
velocity that I'm going

00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:27.380
straight up is-- well, sine of
45 degrees is my vertical

00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:31.250
velocity over my kind of
angled velocity, this

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:34.799
hypotenuse over 10.

00:08:34.799 --> 00:08:36.710
And what's my horizontal
velocity?

00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:39.260
And so if I were to solve for
vertical velocity, I'd get

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:43.760
vertical velocity is
equal to 10 times

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:48.660
the sine of 45 degrees.

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:51.760
And then similarly, my
horizontal velocity, this is

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:55.340
the adjacent over hypotenuse--
cah.

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:57.250
So it's cosine.

00:08:57.250 --> 00:09:02.510
So I could say cosine of 45
degrees is equal to my

00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:05.350
horizontal velocity over 10.

00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:12.220
Or my horizontal velocity is
equal to 10 times the cosine

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:15.030
of 45 degrees.

00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:16.970
I'm about to run out of time, so
I'm going to continue this

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:18.600
in the next video.
